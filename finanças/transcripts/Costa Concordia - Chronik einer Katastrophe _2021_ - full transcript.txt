We weren't worried - the ship can't sink. Hard to port! Oh, my god. At that point... ..I said, "We're all going to die." People crying, the ship tilting more and more... A few minutes after the collision he knew that the ship was lost. Affirmative, water keeps rising. He was sure that the ship would make it to port. Tell them there's been a blackout. I basically saw us in the water. I looked at Sandra and said, "Please, Sandra, don't do this." At that point, survival instincts told me to jump on the lifeboat. Look, Schettino. You may have saved yourself from the sea, but I will absolutely ruin you. Fucking get on board. There was maybe 10, 20cm of air above me, and I tried to stay in the air pocket. We were in the type of hopeless situation that you know you're not getting out of. 32 people died. 32 casualties which should... ..they could and should have been avoided. - Hello? - Yes? This is De Falco from Livorno. Am I speaking to the Captain? Yes, good evening, Commander De Falco. Tell me your name, please. This is Captain Schettino, Commander. Listen, Schettino. There are people trapped on board. You will take your boat under the bow on the starboard side. There is a pilot ladder. You will climb that ladder and go on board, and then you will tell me how many people there are. Is that clear? I'm recording this conversation, Captain Schettino. Commander, at this moment in time... ..the ship is tilted. I understand that. People are coming down the pilot ladder on the bow. You will go up the same ladder. You will get on that ship and tell me if there are children, women or people in need of assistance. And you will tell me the exact number of each of these categories. Is that clear? Look, Schettino. You may have saved yourself from the sea, but I'll take y-it'll be really bad, I will seriously ruin you. Fucking get on board. My name is Gregorio De Falco. In 2016 I was chief executive officer at Livorno Port Authority. I co-ordinated Costa Concordia's rescue operations, keeping in touch with the shipmaster and the Captain. During that phone call I tried everything to beg that man to resume his role. - Commander, please- - No, please, get on board now. I am here to co-ordinate the rescue. What are you co-ordinating from there? Go on board! Co-ordinate the rescue from on board. - Are you refusing? - No, no, I'm not refusing. Get on board! This is an order. I'm in charge now. Get on board! Is that clear? - Fine, Commander, I'm going now. - Go, now! A Captain must not abandon the ship. That's why I told him, quite harshly, to go back on board. Had he gone back on board, had he dedicated himself to saving passengers, things would have gone differently. De Falco's order is... ..now famous all over the world, but it was an impossible order which only served a purpose for the media. It impressed people, it created this general build up of hostility towards Schettino. I think De Falco did the right thing, back then, to be as harsh as he was. There was no other way. He might have been hard, but actually, De Falco was immediately... ..competent, and I think he was the only one that night to have made Italy proud. Because Schettino didn't make us look good in front of the world. Captain, did they crucify you a bit too soon? On that January 13th I partly died too, in a way. From the first hours after the shipwreck, until the last stages of this trial, my head was offered as a sacrifice, in a trial that should have involved a whole company, and instead sees me here as the only defendant. I believe Francesco Schettino was the victim of a ruthless media campaign. Consider that the first instance of the trial, coincidentally and quite symbolically, was held in a theatre. My name is Saverio Senese. I am Francesco Schettino's defence lawyer in his appeal proceedings. Therefore I didn't have the chance to represent him in the investigation or the first instance of the trial. My name is Francesco Verusio. I was public prosecutor in Grosseto in 2012, and, together with my colleagues at the prosecutor's office, we prepared the case for trial to establish the responsibilities regarding the shipwreck. Interviewing Schettino, at first he struck me as someone who didn't realise what had happened. He didn't realise that he'd left 4,200 passengers to fend for themselves. He only thought of how he could protect his image from people and from the company. The Concordia? A dream. Well, it was for me. I'd been on a couple of cruises before, but this was the most beautiful cruise ship I'd ever been on. You see the Costa Concordia lying there, a gigantic ship, and you're really impressed and think it's going to be a great week. We were going to visit many lovely cities with this super ship. Nothing better could ever happen to us. My name is Matthias Hanke, and in 2012, I was a passenger on the Costa Concordia with my buddy Marcel. I'm Marcel Zuhn, and for both of us, it was the second cruise we'd ever been on. Thank you for choosing Costa Concordia for your holiday on the sea. We wish you a pleasant journey and a lovely cruise. Thank you again for joining us. Welcome on board. Let's hear it once more for our Captain, Francesco Schettino! Wonderful. It was a world, a city. It was like a theatre, built in wood, nicely decorated. Enormous chandeliers, even the lifts were gorgeous! Anywhere you looked! - Where are you? - I'm here. At the lifts. The lifts? Where? My son took us that afternoon. And he said to her, "Mum, you've never been anywhere - are you going to sink the ship or something?" - The sun is very bright! - Look at this, come here! In our room the bed was nicely done, the bathroom was lovely, there was a small living room. I immediately opened the window and I saw the sea and I fell in love with this ship. Come and see! My name is Daniela Prestano and I boarded Costa Concordia on January 13, 2012, to join a hairdressers' competition. My name is Luigi Catalli and I boarded Costa Concordia to accompany my wife. The service was perfect. All the shows there were perfect. The bar staff, who worked endlessly, were always friendly. It was an all-round successful holiday. We'd spent the day in Rome, then returned to the ship in the evening, freshened up, then went to dinner and intended to get comfortable in the bar in the atrium, go over the week that had just gone. And then it all started. Good evening. - Good evening, Captain. - Good evening. All right then. Check what speed we need to get out of here, and go by Giglio. They're making me do a sail-past salute at Giglio. OK. Let's plot a course. - Shall I write it on the chart, sir? - Mm-hmm. - Is half a mile all right? - All right. Yeah? From the port. There's seabed anyway. How long will it take to get there if we leave at seven? A couple of hours. 9:30, give or take. OK, all right. - See you later. - See you later. The "sail-past" was planned. We were supposed to do it the week before, but for various reasons it hadn't been done. So that evening the information in the handover was that the course had been slightly adjusted to go give a salute to Giglio Island. My name is Stefano Iannelli. During the Costa Concordia shipwreck I was on the command deck, as an apprentice deck officer. The "sail-past" is a very ancient tradition in sailing. It's a crossing along the coast that was done even in ancient times to pay your respects to a city or a monument. The ship was supposed to cross as close as possible for everyone to see. It's for publicity, in a way. We went to dinner at 18:30, took our seats, and waited for our table companions. They lived in Berlin and were expatriates from somewhere in the Soviet republics. We took Russian at school, so we sang Russian folk songs together. So we always had fun at the evening meal. Salute! Santé, na zdorovie, cheers. - Yes? - Captain, it's Ciro. - Yes? - Six miles. Six miles. All right, that's fine. We should be by Giglio at 21:44. 21:44, OK. My name is Sandro Cinquini. I have been chief medical officer for Costa Cruises for over 30 years and I witnessed the whole tragedy that night on January 13th. I had heard that they were planning on passing by Giglio Island. I was in my cabin and, out of curiosity, I was looking out the window around 9:00, 9:30, to know what we would have seen of Giglio. Everything was dark, though, so I was starting to wonder why we were going through there at all. Good evening. Hi, Francesco. I'm not too late, right? I have to finish the shift. Hi, Antonello. We'll wait. It's not like the island is going anywhere. - All right. - There's still half an hour. Antonello, our waiter. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Well... Schettino wanted to show he was good. - Let's wrap it up and go. - That night... ..Tievoli, the head waiter, had asked him to pass by Giglio that night, because Tievoli's mom lived in Giglio, and Tievoli wanted to say hello. That's why Schettino moved closer. Then there was Miss Cermotan. There was something romantic between the two. Maybe Schettino made that decision in order to impress Miss Cermotan. Good evening. Good evening, Captain. What's the current speed? 15.5. Hand-steering. Copy that, hand-steering. Rusli was the lookout. At the time there was only one. One person would be both lookout and helmsman. If it was deemed necessary to switch to hand-steering, this sailor would switch position, turn off the auto-pilot, so then the ship would depend on the wheel, and orders would be given directly to the helmsman. 278, confirmed. 278. How much now? 285. Schettino always maintained that he decided to go with hand-steering thinking he was still very far from the rocks. After all, the tradition of the "sail-past" was quite a popular procedure, and it had been authorised by the company. Have you called Palombo, Antonello? No, not yet. Go on, call him. Schettino went on the bridge and said, "Hand-steering". What he should have done during such a procedure is to place a lookout on the deck wing, to follow the nautical charts... Instead he pretty much sailed there manually. And as he did this, he called Palombo, an ex-Captain he was acquainted with, who was supposed to be at Giglio. Yes, of course. No, no, he's here. I'll put him on. Mario. Captain Palombo, good evening. We're about to pass by Giglio. Ah! You're not at Giglio. You're in Grosseto. According to Palombo, Schettino was a very good Captain, technically, but he was somewhat arrogant towards his crew and his staff. It was his way or the highway. Even if we get to 0.3 or 0.4, there's water underneath, right? We are at 290. OK, I understand. We're all right, then. Yeah, we'll make a bit of a fuss and say hello to everyone. All right, I'll speak to you later. I take the con. Master takes the con. When he took charge of the ship, he was already off-course. Nonetheless, the officers who were on the bridge did not inform him about the ship being off course. So, unaware and oblivious, he sailed towards the rocks. Let's go to 16. He dropped the course that had been mapped by Canessa and sailed a 300-metre ship at 16 knots without course and without... ..hand-steering like a speedboat. Like... what can I say? Like a raft. It's madness. Come slowly, slowly to 310. - Easy. - 310. Where do we need to go through? In front of the docks? Well, yes. Captain Schettino was very strict. When he entered the bridge, we would fall silent. It wasn't quite... ..fear, but it was always quite tense, it was... He was authoritative. In hindsight, now that I've sailed for eight years, the worst mistake was to not speak up, to not say, "Captain, maybe we're going too fast." "Captain, we should start to pull over now." Because the speed was very high. I knew the facts of what happened, so the public prosecutor's office asked me to cooperate with the investigation. So we went to Grosseto every day for three months, and we talked to the main witnesses, the company, everybody. Under article 295 of our navigation code, the Captain bears final responsibility for supervising the course of the ship, but if the Captain is not there, or somehow seems not to be fit, not up to the task, others have to take the Captain's place. It had happened recently - December 17th, 2011. When the ship was leaving Marseille, although the wind was 60, 65 knots, the decision to sail out to sea was disputed by Ciro Ambrosio. The ship's Captain was very upset by this, because everything in the bridge is recorded. So because of this situation Ambrosio ended up being blamed. The Captain is in command. He's in charge and in command. These officers, mostly very young people, didn't have the nerve, they didn't have the experience to cooperate with superiors, even with critical thinking. They didn't. Because it wasn't allowed. 325. 315. - 325. - 325. 325. I felt at ease. There were competent officers around, and an experienced Captain. So I couldn't imagine what was about to happen. 350. - 340. - 350. 350, otherwise we go on the rocks! Then you see the person that should be confident starting to seem concerned, raising their voice, all those signs that make you go, "Wait a minute, things are not going as they should." Starboard 10! Starboard 10. Starboard 20! - Starboard 20. - Hard starboard! Hard starboard. We're obstructed on the left. The stern is obstructed on the left! That means that the stern doesn't have a clear way to steer. Whichever way it goes, it will hit something. - Port 10! - Port 10. Port, not Starboard! The Captain immediately gave the order to "counter", as we say, so you turn the wheel the opposite way from where the ship is going in an attempt to drive the stern further from the obstacle. The speed was so high and the ship had built up so much momentum that the ship pulled over, but not enough. Port 20! Hard to port! Captain, we have to disengage here! We have to close on the left with the stern, Captain. Did we hit a rock? - Shut the watertight doors astern. - Shut the watertight doors astern! My god, what have I done... It was about 9:30, and we were in the bar. And suddenly there was a jolt, and everything on the table started to slide off. Yeah, it became totally unreal. It was like driving a car and suddenly applying the brakes. Where are we going? No, it's better you sit down. I heard "brrm brrm brrm"... ..then a thud, then another. Then the whole ship spun round. Plates were falling. He immediately said, "Let's get out of here." We were the first to leave. He knew there was something wrong. At one point I heard a screech. It sounded just like... ..a keel stranded in the sand. I thought the ship had got too close to Giglio and that it must have touched the seabed. I would have never imagined that there was such a huge gash on the keel. Mum, let's go! There was a jolt. So, we were in bed watching TV, and there was a jolt. We looked at each other, and thought, are we already at the destination? That can't be true - it's too early. We shouldn't be there till the next morning. And immediately the curtain became crooked, so you could clearly see that the ship was unbalanced from the start. My name is Sandra Birnstiel, and in 2012, I was a passenger on the Costa Concordia. My name is Bianca Ziggert and in 2012, I was on the Concordia for the second time. Then we waited, and we thought, what we were told in the video, that you should dress up warmly, but that you should stay calm. We were walking along the green pier and looking up towards the horizon. We saw this huge ship, strangely close, way too close to the island. My name is Giorgio Fanciulli. On the night of January 13th, 2012, I was the first, with my friends, to see the Costa Concordia approaching the island a few seconds after its collision with the Scole rocks. It's probably the sail-past again. It should be further away. Normally you would see lights and flashes from the cameras. That night there was none of that. Then suddenly all the lights went off and we lost sight of the ship in the overall darkness. It looked like a ghost ship. Please remain calm, and we'll keep you informed as we have more news to inform you. Thank you for your attention. Blackout. As we went up the stairs, the lights went out, and it was pitch black for 20-30 seconds. That's also when you heard the first screams. Of course, some people fell over too. Then the emergency generators turned the lights back on. We were reassured. And then, on Deck 8, we looked down from our balcony... And there were bubbles. Air bubbles came up like crazy. We couldn't explain it to ourselves. We didn't worry - the ship can't sink. Everything was beeping. Anything in the bridge that could beep in that situation was beeping. I realised that we had hit something, that there had been a collision with something. I didn't realise it was so serious. At that time, I think even my colleagues didn't realise what the severity of the damage would be. What did we hit? A rock, it was just above the water. Get the blackout sorted. What matters is that we don't take in any water. - Port 10! - Port 10. Port, not starboard! The helmsman, Rusli Bin, followed orders given to him in an emergency situation incorrectly, doing the complete opposite. When Schettino told him, "Turn left ten degrees," he turned right ten degrees. According to Schettino, if he had followed his orders correctly, the ship would not have ended up on the rocks. When, actually, during the pretrial hearing it was proved that, at that speed, the ship would have hit the rock anyway, so... Schettino didn't have the proper resources to get any consultants who could have attempted to fight back the powerful army of experts and consultants for the prosecution. He was lucky Professor Neri was there, a renowned expert, someone... ..above any kind of bias, I must say. His contribution was clarifying facts. We can see here what really happened, the actual course of events. We see here what would have happened if, 12 seconds before collision with the rock, the helmsman had turned left like Schettino ordered. You see? The rock glances, and then the ship moves away. Surely, even if it had touched, the collision would have been towards the stern, and it would have involved fewer compartments instead of all five. Hand-steering. Rusli Bin, before being a helmsman, worked in maintenance, a steward, even. Schettino had even sent an email to point out the issues caused by the incompetence of most of the members of staff. But he was told that's what they had and what he had to work with. Even if the helmsman had followed the order and the ship had not touched the rock, even then, Schettino... shouldn't have done that procedure. It would have been interesting to question the helmsman. This was not possible because the helmsman was allowed to... ..disappear, to go back to his country. We've never been able to find him again. Start the generator. Say again? The emergency diesel! Start the emergency generator! - Chief. - Yes? Have we taken in any water? Yes, a lot. We can't go down. - Where? - In the engine room. - Is it a lot of water? - There's water. There's no way down. We'll go down the other way. Give me a moment, I'll start the engines, I'll let you know. Captain? Shall we inform the passengers? Yes. Tell them there's been a blackout. Tell me what's going on. Where are you, what is it? I'm in the engine room, I'm having a look. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Due to technical problems, we currently have a blackout. I repeat, due to technical problems, we currently have a blackout. There is no reason to panic. Please stay calm. Our technicians are working on a solution to the problem now. I repeat, we currently have a blackout. But our technicians are already working on a solution. Thank you! Suddenly there was a hullabaloo in the corridor. We went out and wanted to ask the boy some questions, but he didn't really know anything. It was really chaotic. Then we said we'll pack a few things together, and then we'll go out. The first announcement was, "Don't worry." But first in umpteen different languages. That made us a little crazy, until it got to German, and it said that the black box had failed. Now we knew just as much as before, because we didn't know what that means on a ship like this. As we walked back, we noticed that the ship was awkwardly tilted. And there were two lights on the main bridge, two red lights turned on, which means the boat is out of control, the vessel has no propulsion and the rudder doesn't work. Do you speak Spanish? - Yes. - Why are you wearing a life vest - when everything's OK? - Just in case. - So everything's OK? - Everything's fine. - Then why? - Just in case. Crazy. When the first alarm went off, I went to the infirmary, and we were there in this small room, with the door open, and we see the EKG cart rolling past us. My nurse, who was a bit sharper than me, said "The ship is tilting. We need to start assessing the situation." Then the announcement said that the water was rising. Luckily they had started to evacuate floors B and C, where the crew lives. Chief, can we turn on at least one engine? We haven't made it downstairs yet, Captain! We cannot access the engine room from the starboard side. There's water up to the main switchboard. Then we are sinking. I'm not sure I understand. Eh, yeah. There's water up to the switchboard. Excuse me, Captain. We cannot start the engine. The emergency generator is flooded. I only want to know one thing. Can the ship start or not? If not, I have to drop the anchors. We cannot start the engine. The generator is flooded. A few minutes after the collision, he knew that the ship was lost. It was a sinking ship. You're standing on a sinking ship about to go down and you don't make sure to put lifeboats at sea and evacuate the ship, evacuate all passengers? Roberto, I screwed up. I was passing by Giglio Island, here. Captain Palombo told me, "Come by, come by." So I went and I struck shallow water with the stern. I'm dead. Don't say anything. I'm dying. Roberto Ferrarini was the FCC in the company, which stands for Fleet Crisis Coordinator. His job description would only cover what's called first degree, which mainly deals with the financial side of things. Good morning, Ferrarini. So anything related to strikes, staff issues, small malfunctions, but nothing that entailed any potential harm to passengers or to the environment. I did this to please this guy. I sailed by, and there was this little rock, and now we're in the middle of a blackout after hitting the stern. The procedure states that command must alert both the authorities and the ship owner. If the owner hears about it, then it's up to the owner to let us know. But we received no call from Costa Cruises. They probably thought the situation was not serious enough that they had to inform authorities. I'm at the entrance. Just a moment. Give me a breakdown of all the flooded sealed compartments. On board they knew well that the ship was lost. Because Iaccarino, an officer, was sent downstairs to assess the damage, and he said at least three adjacent compartments were flooded. We're tilting left. Water is up to a metre, 1.5 metres from Deck 0. Safety policy in these ships makes sure the ship stays afloat, so it's still considered "safe" with two flooded adjacent compartments. But with three compartments, the ship must be abandoned. It's a dead ship. I can confirm water is not rising, the watertight doors are holding. We're at one and a half to two metres from Deck 0 on the left side. So, Rob, listen to me... We're not sinking, we're not sinking. I'll drop the anchor in a moment. We'll stay here, then we need to get a tugboat to tow us away. Up to a certain point, Schettino was hoping to save the ship with all its passengers and the crew. He hadn't realised the severity of the gash that had damaged the ship. When he spoke to Ferrarini and said, "Send us tugboats and helicopters," he was sure that the ship could reach port. There are rules at sea. When there's an accident this bad, everybody has a precise task. Nobody did what had to be done. Schettino, first and foremost, did nothing. He phoned Ferrarini to try and find a way out of it somehow. That was the truly unforgivable thing about Schettino. Where the fuck is the Captain? Carabinieri. Hello, yes, Carabinieri? - Yes. - Sorry, I'm home with some friends. My friend's mum called us to ask for help, because they are on a Costa Cruise ship and the ship hit something... ..they are all wearing life jackets. - Who are we meant to call? - Who should we... - I didn't catch that, what happened? - Oh, dear... Sometime around 22:00, 22:06, I think, we received a phone call from a carabiniere in the town of Prato, who informed the operating room of the Livorno Captain that a lady had heard from her mother, who was on board a cruise ship, that there was a blackout on the ship, that objects were falling from tables as they had dinner, and that they had been asked to wear life vests. The staff in the operating room found this ship to be stationary at Giglio Island. This ship was heading to Savona, but the bow was pointing south. And that was odd because, on the one hand we knew that it was drifting under the influence of winds and currents. On the other hand it was telling us it was very close to the island, therefore in quite a perilous situation. Costa Concordia? Costa Concordia? This is the coast guard from Circomare Porto Santo Stefano. Do you copy on channel 16? This is Costa Concordia, over. Good evening, Costa Concordia, can I ask if you have any problems on board? Tell them there's a blackout. We are experiencing a blackout. We are assessing it. Do you need any assistance or are you just staying put for now - at Giglio Island? - Roberto? Affirmative, we're staying here to assess the blackout. What kind of an issue? Is it... ..the generator? The police in Prato received a phone call from a relative of someone on board who said everything was falling in the dining room. Negative, there is a blackout. We are assessing the situation. How long has the blackout been going on? 20 minutes, more or less. OK. Keep us in the loop. We clearly heard the first call from the coast guard in Livorno to command. From land we could hear screaming from people wearing life jackets. We heard the PA announcements telling everybody to keep calm. All of that didn't match with a simple blackout. I personally contacted the emergency number of the Captain to explain to them that what they were telling them from on board was not accurate as to what was happening. The ship took that turn purely by God's will. The ship would have completely tipped over had the wind not taken it towards the rocks. 4,200 people would have died. The kind of panic on that ship... People were terrified. It was pretty much "Every man for himself." That night we were very, very lucky that it so happened that the Costa Concordia was driven towards the island of Giglio, and then came to rest there. Otherwise it would have been a much, much bigger catastrophe. We realised the danger, and he said, "Let's go upstairs, because I saw life jackets there." So we walked up the stairs for eight floors, but we were so anxious we forgot the cabin number. And, after quite a while, we found them. - There was no info. - No. We packed a few things, and, of course, put our life jackets on... And then we went out. Walking through the restaurant, everything rattled and clattered. I heard this rattling of dishes for a long time afterwards. There were shards everywhere. You couldn't really walk right, because there was broken stuff everywhere. That was crazy. Let's evacuate the crew and passengers, too. Why is Ferrarini not answering me? Then we went down again... Then more and more people in life vests came, and they just sat there, sometimes howling, sometimes screaming. A lot of people were already standing at the muster station. But, to us, there was no ranking, and then we said, "Perhaps we should get a life vest." There were also a lot of children on the ship, small Italian children, with their mums. And eventually we asked, where do we go? First they said go to the front. Then they said go to the back. There were no more announcements about what we should do, so we thought, OK, we must get outside to start with, to see where are we, anyway? Try to turn on the engines. Is there no way we can counter this drifting? I'd been on a lot of ships when I was in the Navy. So we immediately went upstairs to the fourth floor, where they had lifeboats. I started to prepare a lifeboat. I was on my own - nobody else was outside. There were so few crew members. I only saw one who came with me in the lifeboat to give me a hand. It was a mess. People screaming, stealing your life jacket off you, because there were not enough jackets. So they would say, "Go get them in your cabin. Keep calm." People screaming, children crying, water on the floor, people slipping. Keep calm, for god's sake. We were all arguing because we could see how serious it was, how the ship was tilting. My name is Sabatelli Nada and on the night of January 13th, 2012, I was on board Costa Concordia. My name is Grattagliano Valentina and I still have my card to get in the cabin. My name is Giuseppe Miccoli. I am one of the ones who brought lifeboats to shore. The ship is slightly tilted to the left. I have no clue... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) We went to the side that was rising, and at that point I phoned the carabinieri, and they said I should phone the coast guard, and I said, "Wait... I'm asking for your help, can you call them?" He gave me their number, and I called the coast guard. They said, "They told us it's a blackout." So I told them, "Look, I've worked on military ships, where 'blackout' means there's no power, not that the ship is tilted seven to eight degrees." They go, "All right, just to be safe we've already sent over three boats." The deputy chief from Livorno was suspicious. He said, "Chief, they're not telling the truth." I called the bridge again. Only then does Costa Concordia say that it's not just a blackout, but they are taking water in. So it's not just a blackout, you also have a leak? Yes, we do. Yes, we have a leak. Do you want a tugboat or some other type of assistance? Is there anybody injured? We request one tugboat. All passengers are already wearing life jackets. My first reaction was a bit of fear. Americans say we spend all our lives preparing to deal with mass rescue operations, but also praying we never need to. Because in these situations there's always a price to pay. The price is human lives. The Guardia di Finanza motorboat was not far from the location so we redirected it to the scene. Captain, we're just about to approach you. As soon as they arrive and take a look at Concordia, they say the ship is starboard down, so the stern is on the seabed or a rock. They also told us they had their starboard anchor down, which meant that the ship was in a position to lower lifeboats. Why are they not lowering lifeboats? Affirmative. Water is rising to stern elevators and keeps rising. Water goes up to a metre. I'll get in through the fire doors. All right, Rob, things are getting bad. Not yet, not yet. It's about 22:30. He still hasn't given the distress signal, nor the general alarm on board. So obviously he hasn't ordered abandon ship. The crew stood in front of the entrance to the lifeboats and didn't let people in them. Quite the opposite. Then there was an announcement by an employee, "You should go to your cabins, and don't panic." On behalf of our Captain, we kindly ask you to go back to your cabin or, if you wish, you can go to the main hall. Everything is under control. OK? Captain, passengers are going to the boats. Should we sound the general alarm? Wait. Many of them said, "Sound the general alarm, sound the alarm." And he was like, "Wait, wait." To the last minute he tried to find a way that HE could get out of it. Knowing well that the ship was lost. - We have to abandon the ship! - Get out of there, go! Order to abandon the ship! All right, but give me a second to call Ferrarini. Roberto, everything is failing. I'm at 0.2 from the island. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. We ask you to stay calm, and gather at the meeting point at the muster station on Deck 4 wearing your life jacket. Follow the staff's instructions. Please gather at the muster station, the meeting point on Deck 4. I just spoke to the steward who's doing the announcements. They are keeping everybody calm. We are right in front of the island. No pictures, no pictures. And when we got to Deck 4, it was rammed full, and inhuman scenes were already being played out. People were running wild, screaming, pushing. You know, it wasn't "women and children first". They were acting like that. I don't want to demonise anyone, because this was an exceptional situation, but it was shocking to see - there it was every man for himself. And the conditions on Deck 4 were already very bad. Costa Concordia, I am asking if you are in distress. - Are you in distress? - What shall I say, Captain? We are signalling distress at the moment. Tell them. We are now giving the distress signal. Finally they give the distress signal at my request. If we'd waited longer, the rescue teams would have been even later. He sailed his ship at 17 knots against the rocks. It's no laughing matter, there's no excuse, but the ship is still afloat. 4,000 people on that ship. 30, 40, 50 sea units outside are not enough. These people need to get off the ship, and their fate is in the hands of command. If command on board does not cooperate with outside rescuers it's not going to work. At first, one can imagine getting lost in the moment, but after more than an hour, and the ship... And you know the ship is about to sink, at what point do you lower the lifeboats and save all the passengers? He didn't do any of that. When clearer information was delivered, Schettino gave the general alarm immediately. He tried to get as close as he could first. Because, if he had given the order when the ship was still at a certain speed, the lifeboats would probably have tipped over. Hundreds of people would have died. The right thing to do would have been to conduct professional inquiries through proper simulation processes. My name is Mario Pellegrini. On January 13th, 2012, I was deputy mayor of Giglio Island. I was just back from a trip to the US, coincidentally on a cruise ship. I was just about to go to sleep, because I was too jetlagged the night before to go to sleep. I received a phone call from the Chief of the Giglio Island police, and he said there was a ship in distress just outside Giglio docks. So I got my car and drove to Giglio docks. Once I entered the road that leads to the east side of the island, I couldn't believe my eyes. This huge ship aground on our rocks, full of lights. I kept driving because I knew the way there by heart. Or maybe my car knew the road better than I did. But I couldn't keep my eyes off the ship. Adrenaline started to pump, and suddenly I wasn't sleepy anymore. I reached the main square and I left my car right in the middle. I met with the mayor, who had got there a few minutes before me. So together we started to take action. We phoned anybody who could help, we opened up schools, we started all the emergency procedures we could manage from the island. We still didn't understand what had happened. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Please proceed to your meeting point at the muster station on Deck 4 and follow the instructions of the staff, and stay calm. When we heard the signals to abandon ship, my partner, who is an expert, said, "I've had enough." He walked up to the guy who was keeping everybody behind a barrier, keeping everybody out, shook him and said, "Get out of the way, we're coming through. We can't stay here anymore." It had become a huge mess all over the deck. Seeing all those people running around like headless chickens, not knowing which one was supposed to be their lifeboat, jumping on the first one they could find, struggling, some slipping on the deck, which was slanted. So that was tragic in itself. And I tried to say that we were 200 metres away from Giglio. I was sure we were in the open sea - we hadn't seen the island at all. We hadn't had the chance to look in that direction. We always saw the open sea. Why didn't anyone think of calming the passengers down? So, if we lower the lifeboats, can I say over the radio that we're about to abandon the ship? Wait. We are evacuating passengers. Tell them, "We are evacuating passengers." We are evacuating passengers ourselves and getting them to land. He could not accept that he, the Captain of the ship, had to tell his passengers to abandon the ship. It was a dishonour to him. He is very full of himself. He would have never done that. When I came back from trying to get information that nobody gave me, I found her right beside the lifeboat. They were all ready. She was just standing there. I said, "What are you doing?" "I'm waiting." "What are you waiting for, get in!" We got in and there was only one seat left on the lifeboat. The lifeboat steward started to push it. Since the boat was tilted like this, and the lifeboats were here, they got stuck on the deck below. We swung it back and forth and it rocked for a bit, and then we started to descend. I'm so scared. Oh, my god. At that point I said, "We're all going to die." Plummeting from the third floor, with 100 people on the lifeboat it's like landing on cement - everybody dies. Thinking I was about to die, I prayed. Then in hindsight you feel a bit embarrassed, - thinking "Your last thought was..." - Who cares? Nobody knew you. "..only dedicated to God?" To be honest, yes. The Guardia di Finanza was shining a beam light to show us the gash on the ship that was sucking everything inside. My god... I had never seen anything like it. It was slashed, like a razor blade had sliced it open. It was always, we must go to the front, like other people had said. There were still boats there. And then it was, no, don't go there, there are no more boats there. I didn't even think of being scared. We simply functioned. I kept thinking, this isn't real, what's happening here. Help me! The basic staff tried hard to make the lifeboats seaworthy. First they got the anchor out. Anyway, it was the cook, the waiter, the cabin staff... Everyone possible was there, but no officers - well, I didn't see any. From our point of view, they let us all down. My career as a Captain is over. We hit shallow waters with the ship. We're following the correct procedures. I'm saving all the passengers, it's fine. Don't worry. Everything is under control. As apprentice deck officer, my job in case of emergency was to lead a "Tango-India" team to rescue the injured. So immediately after impact I left the deck to look for the injured. I was able to act on instinct thanks to adrenaline. Adrenaline kept me going until I got to land. Roberto, we are evacuating passengers to land. I managed to drift where I wanted to. I dropped two anchors right next to the docks. The stern is in shallow water. The ship is not going anywhere. It can't go anywhere. What do I tell the press? This is the Livorno Captain. Captain, we have a favour to ask. Can you tell us how many passengers are still waiting to be evacuated? I think we pretty much evacuated all of them. More or less, give us. The naval units need to know. They need to organise the dispatch of... - So they can transport... - Two or three hundred... Two or three hundred between staff and passengers. Approximately 4,000 have been evacuated. Is everybody leaving the ship or is someone staying? I'm staying because we're close to the coast. I think we are up against the seabed at this point. Because the water... The keeling should stop by now, thanks to the water, no? - I mean, it shouldn't get any wor- - So, is it just you staying... - ..or is anyone else staying? - I think it will be just me. Only you, that's fine, Captain. Take the documents, come with me to Deck 4. Are we abandoning the deck? I didn't say to abandon deck. Come with me. As Captain, Schettino should have stayed on the bridge. He wasn't supposed to wander around. His job was to stay on the bridge and handle all procedures from there until the end, and he had to be the last one to leave. We saw the lifeboats coming off this big ship. When the first one reached port, the mayor and I started to help passengers get off. We were asking for information, but nobody was telling us anything. I told him, "Boss, maybe I should get on board." He nodded and said, "Yes." On my way there I was looking at this ship, amazed. The closer we got, the bigger it was, the more it looked scary, because you saw it towering over you as if it was about to fall on top of you. We stopped by the bow of the ship, where there was a pilot ladder. It was quite difficult to climb it. Once on board, I went around looking for an officer. I tried to reach the bridge. I walked around for about 20 minutes. I didn't meet anybody. When I got back down to the right side there were people, including elderly people, who needed help to board the lifeboats that were under the deck. All these people came from the other side of the ship. So I told myself I had to get to the other side to take others to the right side. At one point they stopped lifeboats from descending because otherwise they would have been against the sloping keel. So everybody needed to get to the other side. Because over there they would be closer to water. Whoa! When all the lifeboats were gone, the life buoys were thrown in, that you have to inflate yourself. And then there's a sort of mini hole where you first get into the water, and then you have to crawl. And then I looked at Sandra and said, please don't do this to me. I could never do that. Let's wait until we can walk into the water, not jump, because we don't know what's underneath it. And so we simply waited for a long time. I basically pictured us in the water, I have to say, honestly, and then a lifeboat came back. And it veered really close to the ship, and then we could get in there with dry feet. Careful, careful, careful... Guys, guys, please. Maybe it was almost midnight or just past midnight... This boat shows up and suddenly the inclination changed quite rapidly. So at that point we jumped, we jumped on the boat. I jumped, Salvatore jumped, and Captain Schettino jumped, too. We got on top of the boat, on its roof, and I noticed the Captain was there. Deck 3 was underwater immediately after, so... ..there was no way we could go back on board from that side. Anybody who had stayed on that deck at that moment would have ended up in the water. And in the water, with all the undertow and the whirlpools that could occur, one was as likely to survive as to not survive. At that point, survival instinct told me to jump on the lifeboat. I can say I was very lucky, because as soon as I stepped on Deck 4 on the left side, the boat started to topple. And it tilted for a third time. And it was tragic, because this third tilt meant that the deck was underwater on one side. The sound of the water was awful. It came with such strength... ..it was unbelievable. Fear had a grip on us all. We were nearly at the other side, and then the ship did a massive jolt again. And then the water came towards us - there came a gigantic flood - and panic broke out. "Back, back, back!" We had two old ladies by the hand. We pushed and pulled them, and... ..It didn't work. I kept slipping, Marcel kept slipping. In the end we got stuck by the lifts. And in that moment, when the water was waist high, the lift doors opened. Really burst open, really tore apart. There was a short, violent scream from one of the two ladies, and then they were gone. The women had no chance at all. Everyone near us who had not held on was then washed away. I didn't think any but us had survived. I was standing with this one woman who held me tight and said, "I don't want to die." And I said, "You won't die - you have a life vest on, your head is above the water. You don't need to be scared." Yes, but in the lift, or in the lift shaft... That didn't work. We no longer knew what was going to happen. The other side was now unreachable, because it was too far away. From our side the water was getting higher and higher... And then, logically, panic rose up in us. We were in the type of hopeless situation that you know you're not getting out of. At one point the ship stopped moving, and by an incredible stroke of luck, the full moon started to shine on us. There must have been about 100 people on this bridge. There was an unbelievable crowd. I could see families, people had children. Everybody wanted to get on. I said, "You're behaving like animals. Women and children should go first. Don't act like beasts." And I hear a voice behind me that, on the other hand, was calming. "Don't treat them like that, they're just scared, you see." I turn and I see this man, approximately 60 years of age, a little overweight, with a beard, big eyes and big smile. It was a moment of panic, when panic strikes, there's no reaso- They teach you this as well. It was the same for the Captain, he lost control. You never know how someone might react when panic strikes, even if you are the trained Captain of a ship. Even he fell into the trap of panic. My name is Roberto Galli. In 2012, I was chief of local police in Giglio Island. I am the first to have found Francesco Schettino on the night of the shipwreck. We managed to reach the rocks in front of the Concordia ship. The people there had all jumped into the sea. Some were injured. There was even a disabled person. They all gathered together to warm up a bit, because, even if it was a lovely night, it was still January 13th. I found five or six people on that path. One of them introduced himself as one of the ship's officers, and further away Captain Schettino was on the phone. So I approached Captain Schettino, I introduced myself and I said, "Look, Captain, I can take you to the docks, and from there I can take you back to the ship." He didn't look wet to me. So he hadn't fallen into the sea. The other officers, on the other hand, were all wet. The Captain said, "No, look, I need to stay here because I need to co-ordinate the evacuation from the ship." I was confused, and said, "You can't co-ordinate anything from here." A couple of officers said, "Captain, why don't you go to the docks and return..." But he was determined to stay and I couldn't make him change his mind. Hello? This is De Falco from the Livorno. Is this the Captain? Yes, good evening, Captain De Falco. Listen to me, Schettino. There are people trapped on board. You will take your boat under the bow on the starboard side. I think that, at the time, Captain Schettino hadn't realised what had actually happened. He still hadn't processed the massive damage, the massive tragedy that was occurring. I am here to co-ordinate the rescue. What are you co-ordinating, there? The fact that he was saying, "I need to co-ordinate the rescue operations here," when in that area, from there, nothing could be done, shows his state of mind. In fact, that was when the famous phone call took place, with Captain De Falco. Fucking get on board! - Captain, please. - No, now you will get on board. - Get on board. - Fine, Captain. - I'm going. - Go now. Schettino said, "Look, I was keeping in touch from the rocks, with port authorities and the bodies responsible. And I was co-ordinating all the rescue procedures, suggesting what side they should approach the ship from, where the survivors were located, and so on." And then he mentioned, actually, that he had seen a boat with a lantern, a light, and he had signalled, asking if they could take him back to the ship. My name is Massimo Bancalà. On January 12th 2012, I was on board the motorship Aegilium. We recovered 80 survivors from the lifeboats. I was later sent on the rescue boat to see if there were any survivors in the water or to assist people struggling on the right side of the Concordia ship. Once we got there, under the starboard side we noticed two people trying to get our attention with lights. We approached them, and one of them was Captain Schettino. He got on board the boat, and, as they got closer to the ship, unfortunately the boat started to take on water. So they ordered the sailors to get back to the docks and not to accompany Schettino. It was bumpy. Boats were going back and forth, creating more waves and we took on water twice, so we risked sinking. I think he would never have been able to go back up, because the ladder on the left side was full of passengers in the process of getting off. So it would have been tough to climb back up. The Captain was very quiet. He was quite upset because he knew what was going on. I think he was frustrated because he couldn't get back on the ship. Schettino didn't run away. He was not "Captain Coward" who abandoned ship. He was the last one to get off the ship, and he had to get off. Had he not, he would definitely have died. He also tried to get back on the ship, but he was not able to. It was not possible. Everybody says that, as prosecutors, we were very mean to him. When actually we investigated everything there was to find out, very thoroughly. There was no way anybody but Schettino was to blame for what happened. We were the only hospitality facility open that night. We already had two guests who had gone to sleep. My name is Paolo Fanciulli. I own the Hotel Bahamas. That night we welcomed hundreds of survivors, and the last of them was Captain Schettino. When I saw the ship sinking, I ran to the hotel and turned the heating on, turning on all the lights, getting all rooms prepped. Then I saw a huge crowd coming, all in orange, because they were still wearing their life jackets and nobody wanted to take them off. It wasn't very cold, but we were all dressed lightly because we came from the ship where it was warm. This is no joke. People everywhere, people everywhere. A church full of people with life jackets on... The church was full. Children in bathing suits, people without shoes. After all, nobody carried anything on them. Nothing. They started to enter the rooms, at least 30 to 40 at a time, packed like sardines. I had no more space to offer them, but they kept coming. A hotel, a pharmacy... People from Giglio Island were just... Some gave out jackets, dresses. They were wonderful. We gave them everything we had. We gave them drinks. Anything we had, we were out of in only a few minutes. We tried to give them blankets but we didn't have enough. They ripped off curtains to cover themselves. They took whatever kind of cover and they took it with them. There weren't that many blankets. Only a few. By the time we got there they were gone already. In the end, you felt lucky, because you heard that there were people who still had to get off, some were saying that others had died. In the end, you stop thinking about yourself, right? He was on one side, I was on the other side. Then we could look again, and then we said, "From now on, every man for himself." This powerlessness that we felt, this fear of death that rose up, overwhelmed us, naturally, made us say, "We won't pay attention to the others now, because right now we're not getting out." Every man for himself. And that is... totally brutal. In the end the water poured in. At first the water was knee-high, then waist-high, and it got ever higher. And there was perhaps 10-20cm air above me, and I tried to stay in this air pocket. And then I thought to myself, "Hold your breath, and see where it takes you." At some point I got hold of the handrail, and then, like on a pull up bar, metre by metre... ..I moved myself to the aisle. And you're totally broken after 3-4 metres. It was an infinitely long time, till at some point I was heading in the direction of the deck. Then I dived and was flushed into the restaurant. Then I could grab hold somewhere. Then I climbed up, so at least I was in the dry. Then I held on tight to the structure, and then, step by step, climbed up. And then I was lying on the outer hull. And I have to totally honestly say, with every sound I heard, with every movement the ship made, I always somehow felt fear that the Costa was completely sinking. So being saved, rescued or whatever, wasn't in the picture. I called, again and again, "Help!" At some point I heard a voice. "Hey, mister, come here. Here is an exit." And then I saw two people, and I swam in that direction. With the last of my strength, I tried to get out of the water, then we crawled along a shaft. Yeah, and then we could look, look upwards, and we saw the sky. But you couldn't climb higher there, because it was stainless steel. And then suddenly someone looked through the hole. We saw people screaming for help from the depths. I could hear water coming. I immediately looked for a rope, and slowly but surely we pulled nine people from that tunnel. It was incredibly tiring. I helped the last young man out. He said he had seen the bodies of a child and an adult in the restaurant. And then we all started to talk about the tragedy, saying, "Who knows how many of them there were?" In the end, I was crawling along the outer hull and then I saw that there was a stepladder there. And then we climbed down the stepladder one at a time and onto this small boat. I saw the coastguard, that there were lights over there, there was an island over there. And I couldn't believe my eyes, because nobody had told us about that. We helped hundreds of people off the ship, down the ladder, while the coast guard recovered people from the sea. Getting all those people to climb down that night was very hard. Firstly, because it was slippery, because it was wet. Secondly, because only one at a time could climb down, slowly, because if someone slipped, it would have been 40 to 50 metres of free fall. So, helping people down, keeping them calm, Um... After the scare they got, it wasn't easy. I got to the island at about 16:30. The first thing I saw was a huge sea of life vests. All the life vests were in a heap. And naturally my biggest concern was, did Matthew make it? There was an unspoken fear visible in every face, that something had happened, that someone hadn't made it. Naturally, I also felt that, and so I kept looking. Can I see him anywhere? Then I saw him standing on the footbridge. I was so happy. I was weak at the knees. I really broke down, and then waited, sitting down, until we docked. Then I got down from the coastguard's boat. I don't think I've ever wept so much in my life. Yes, it affected me a lot. Then, afterwards, when you think about everything that happened, and the worse things that could have happened... Yes... In any case, I was very happy that both of us got off so lightly - that we were so lucky. Others weren't as lucky. Between 8:00 and 9:00, everybody left. After they all left, Captain Schettino arrived and asked me if I could get a coffee with plenty of sugar for him. I could tell he was very upset. His face looked very tired, very disheartened. I was surprised, though, because you could see the ship from a window, here on our terrace, and he said, "That rock had no markers." It almost seemed like he was trying to absolve himself. It gave me a bad feeling, because I realised he was someone on the brink of a nervous breakdown. But at the same time he had that swaggering vibe about him, telling me that the rock was unmarked. As if the rock was to blame. At a first glance Schettino struck me as someone very arrogant, very... Quite full of himself, I must say. Sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, but... I mean, his culpability was so blatant that I don't understand how he thought he could hide behind other possible scenarios that he claimed were possible. Schettino tried any way he could to get out of this mess. I believe Francesco Schettino was a victim of a ruthless media campaign that immediately showed him to the world as a cowardly and incompetent Captain who, after making his ship sink, abandoned his crew and passengers without fulfilling the role that he was bound to carry out by law. The judges were good, however. In my opinion, they had been influenced by what has been, from day one, the image of a scapegoat painted by the press all over the world. ..sentence him to the overall sentence of 16 years of detention, in addition to the costs of proceedings. I remember perfectly that, back then, we sent 12, 13 people to trial. All of them, except for Schettino, settled or opted for abbreviated proceedings. Had he gone for abbreviated proceedings, he would have cut a third off his sentence. I cannot understand why he would go through a trial. Maybe he thought, somehow, in the end, he would be acquitted. He never admitted to any wrongdoing. Right up until the end he even maintained he never abandoned ship. We turned to the European court, protesting the influence that, through every stage of this situation, the media had. We asked the European court to look into it, to investigate if, as we fear, the power of suggestion caused by this media campaign was the leitmotif on which everybody based their view of Schettino's trial. It's true that survivors end up carrying something with them. You carry it with you. To this day, we say, "It's been ten years. What more can we do?" Because you could have died that day, right? I keep going, I've kept going through the years. Sailing, and making use of this legacy, to improve myself, to understand people. The worst experience of my life helped me to grow. When I hear helicopter blades, I often think about it... And dishes rattling - that's me. That's definitely stuck with me. I'm not startled anymore, but when I hear it, I connect it with this disaster. For me, the first year and a half were really hardcore, because I also had a compromised immune system. So I took everything I could with me, and was also, psychologically, really very, very battered. But now ten years have passed, and I've put it in perspective. Especially the two women who put their trust in us and didn't make it. That is an absolutely terrible, terrible feeling that one has. We really did do our best. We were with them for almost two hours on board, while we went, step by step, through the ship. We cheered them up, entertained them. I think, too, we couldn't do anything else, but, nevertheless, you have the feeling that you've failed, and that you couldn't do it. Sometimes terrible tragedies happen, and in this case... ..uh, it was terrible. But there's always something spiritual to help you get through. All these unlucky people, me included. Had the wind been different, the ship could have ended up a long way from the island and it would have completely sunk. Had that happened, we would have counted survivors, not victims. Costa Cruises declined to give an interview for this documentary. In a written statement, the company expressed sympathy with the victims. One doesn't want to comment on the Italian legal processes in this case. After the disaster, the International Association of Cruise Lines worked out a series of security procedures that go beyond the international requirements. The procedures on board are also said to have been revised. This includes the right for all officers to have a say in manoeuvres.
