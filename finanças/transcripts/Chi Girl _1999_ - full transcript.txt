And I thought about it for, like, two weeks. And finally, I realized that, um, the reason that I paused was because I thought this could be the last time ever that anybody wants to do anything even remotely sexual with me.

[Randy] Apparently, there wasn't one solid, decent-looking challenge of a guy in there. Not a single guy looked in her direction. Marie gave her phone number to three guys over the course of the evening-- one a Calvin Klein model, another a well-known actor in town to shoot a film. But Heather wasn't satisfied with any of them. She let Marie have them, she said. We plan to go out again in a couple days. She'd been putting off work. She needed to deal with that first, clear her head before she got focused about the theory.

[car horn chirps] I'd learned long ago that if you ask a subject about their quirks, they become self-aware and then cease such actions. I didn't ask. I waited. I filmed. But it was getting on my nerves. I found it interesting that she was still clinging to this insipid theory about men being easy targets, when she was so completely full of shit. At least it gave me somewhere to go every couple days. So, that's a total fluke, Randy, because... that first guy was definitely... he was weird, but he was gay. I mean, he was--you saw him. He was standing-- before he started talking to me, he was standing with those-- you know, that group of, like, uh, really well-dressed, good-looking... That second guy was just... He was married. Did you see him? I--I swear to God he had a ring on his finger. And--and he--you saw him. He walked away with that girl. And he was definitely-- he was cute. Don't get me wrong, he was cute, but he definitely was not the cheating type, was he? Then the third guy was, um... He was just, uh... He was just really lame.

I lied. Said we should try a couple more times, we'd been getting closer-- a stall tactic so I could figure out something else. [♪, indistinct chatter] What would I do with my time otherwise? Fine, she wore glasses. She didn't wear a lot of makeup when maybe she needed it. She dressed kind of like a man, like she was telling men to stay away. She was always depressed, annoyed, irritated, or bored. Fine. It didn't mean there weren't men out there attracted to those things. She was right. It was her. Not a single loafer-wearing asshole was interested in even walking around the park with her, let alone sleeping with her. It was her.

Right now. [laughs] Why? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't understand. Oh, let's not analyze it. If you want to go-- Randy. If you want to go, let's just go. Is this a joke? Is this some-- No, it's not a joke. There's no joke. -Let's just-- -What, you got a bet? What? No, it's not a bet.

All right. Now I'm crazy, Randy. [Randy] What would it take to get a guy to come home with her? That's when we both decided we wanted to figure that out. The experiment, the documentary would be about the metamorphing of wallflower into dream girl. Well, "dream girl" was probably pushing it. "Girl" would be a decent start. But I had one question for her first. I couldn't help it anymore. I had to ask. I had to know who she was waiting to hear from all the time. [indistinct chatter] And for once, she was quiet for an eternity-- almost three whole minutes. Jack and I broke up about eight months ago, and, um, I'm not saying that, uh... I want him back or that I'm like obsessing about it or anything. Even though I know it looks that way. But, um, it just ended a little strangely, and I know that he is gonna wanna call me and want me back, and the least I can do is be there for him, right? I don't want him back. We have, like, such a strong bond. It's like this incredible connection that I know he's gonna-- he's gonna get off work one night, and he's gonna call me, and he's gonna want me back. And, you know, the least I can do is be there for him, you know? I don't care if he begs. I don't want to see him. Um, you know, maybe I'll have lunch with him. But, you know, I will not take him back, and I definitely won't sleep with him. I don't care. If he tells me that he's in love with me, then maybe I'd sleep with him, but I would just sleep with him, and then end it, be completely over it. I don't need to talk about him anymore. I'm not--I'm completely done with it. I'm not gonna talk about him anymore. Besides, I'd have to be completely insane to think that, you know, we were, like, right for each other, like, he's the guy. He's not the guy. I know that. You know, we wanted different things. I wanted to be, you know, adored. And he wanted to be... well, he just wanted to be alone, so... And besides, he smokes, right? He's a smoker. It's disgusting, so I'm-- I'm done talking about him. I don't even remember anything about him, you know? I, uh, I can't even remember, like, some of the most meaningful, you know, moments of our relationship. This is where we had our, um, our first kiss, actually. We were, like, sitting in this, just, like, this little table back there, and we were like-- he, like, had me come and sit next to him and he, like, pulled my stool closer to him, and he-- he's a really good kisser. Really good kisser, you know, except for that disgusting cigarette smell. He's like--oh, I just love kissing him. He's so good at it. Maybe I should not wear the glasses. Maybe that would... What do you think? Start wearing my-- I mean, I need 'em to see, so... [car engine sputtering] Need to find somebody to give me a light. -Hi. -Yeah, hi. There wasn't anything like this since-- Not choose girls at all. This is the exact spot right here, Randy, where, um... It was so cute. It was like the, uh... the first time that-- he's so adorable. I--I asked him, you know, just kind of casually what he had done the night before. And he said, you know, that he just when home and went straight to bed. And it was, like, really sweet because he totally lied. He's so cute the way he lied. I mean, he's like a guy who can be really cute, even when he, you know, lies. Um, do you think I look better without the, uh, glasses? I'm like going for the "girl look" now. So this is, uh...this is Jack's favorite restaurant bar. And... I came here with him, but, uh... You know what? [dog barking in distance] We got in a fight here once. We were, like, fighting in front, and then we went inside, and we weren't, like, even speaking to each other, but, um, you know-- hold on a second. Can we-- let's hold on a second. Um... Oh, my God. Um... Shit. Randy. Oh, my God. That's his car. That's--that's Jack's car. So, uh... Which means that Jack is, like, right around here somewhere. And--you know what? Can we like get away from here? I don't want to-- I don't want to--let's just-- Let's just, uh... So we were, like, out there fighting, we go in, and we're not talking, and then, um, you know, we kind of become friends again, whatever. And so I do him a little favor. I take him into the bathroom, and, you know, I do something very nice for him in there. I'm not going to get too graphic. But--so then even after I do that, he still can't have sex. So what was the point of that? He's such a dumb shit. He's such a fucking alcoholic. He's just a loser. Why hasn't he called me? What if we do that? If I look like those girls that I make fun of? What do you think about that? Like, the kind of girls who talk about all the time about the boob job they're going to get, or, uh... you know, the, you know, collagen or girls that, like, can talk about how they're going to get their hair done. Jack was just down here, actually. His L stop is, like, just down there. I don't think this is working, Randy. You know, maybe I'm giving off the wrong signals. You know, I'm giving off some kind of like, "I'm a miserable, pathetic loser" signal. You know, my grandmother, she was, like, this old Irish woman. She--she always had, like, this disgusting illness to tell you about. She used to say that, "Relax." You know? 'Cause men are like trains, you know? Another one will be along in another, you know, five minutes or whatever. My grandmother's such a fucking idiot. It was busses, not trains. Trains? What century was she living in? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Randy. That was Jack. Did you see her? She was like-- she was like a super model. She was blonde and perfect. That was so weird. That was... She's like a model, wasn't she? She was... She was really thin and perfect and... So you're gonna come home with me then, right? -[man] No. -What do you mean? Last time. I'm not gonna say it again. What do you mean no? Oh, because I'm, like, not your perfect image of a woman. I'm not Cindy Crawford or Claudia Schiffer. I don't have fake breasts. Or, you know, I'm not Barbie doll-ish enough for you.

Then I spent the rest of the semester trying to avoid her while she tried to run into me at parties. Heather wasn't that bad. She'd had a relationship with this Jack guy. She was trying to figure out what men didn't like about her, what people didn't like about her. As she got more aggressive, I got more excited about this experiment. [Heather] I'm completely over it. All that time worrying about if he was gonna call me or not. I don't give a shit. It's played itself out. I'm over it. I am... I'm over it.

But I realized she already knew he was an attorney and didn't even flinch. I was just too lazy to interrupt, too lazy after eating one piece of Chicago-style pizza the night before. Hopefully, she'd realize that the fact that he was speaking to her meant there had to be something wrong with him. I mean, come on. He was a fucking attorney. They were completely wrong for each other. It would only be hours or minutes even till it got stale and crunchy. I was feeling rather great about that. The waiting was bothering me a little bit, though. It was so obvious to me that this whole thing was a joke, a waste for both of them. I couldn't figure out why it was taking her so long to get it or for him to get it. I waited the entire night for it to become clear to him that she wasn't very cute when you were sober, that she was really very irritating. The entire night. He must have been a real idiot. It was taking him a very long time. And then I just waited for him to come out. As I sat there in the cold in the dark, first, I disliked him. But as the hours turned over, I began to wholeheartedly despise him. By morning, there had never been another human being on the planet who disgusted me as much as he did. Repulsive. I called Heather that day after I recovered some sleep, and she agreed to come out with me again, work on the experiment I just didn't care about anymore.

And as it oozes out, it's kind of a warm juice, and occasionally, it can get-- I don't want to go. Thank you. But, you know, it'll get on your chin and you can just-- if you pardon me... -You know--I--really don't... -It--it's... -Ollie. Is it Ollie? -Yeah, it's Ollie. Thank you. I... Are you sure? Because I really think-- I'm sure. I--I don't. [Randy] Something had changed. Something big. I really like it. It's a great job. I mean, the guys are great to work with, but I love driving the car. You know, I love cars. I always had--I had a great relationship with cars growing up working with my dad, and that kind of stuff. Oh, my God. You know what? I have not heard a single word you've said. [laughs] Oh, really? I completely-- I'm so sorry. I completely wasn't listening to you at all. I've been--I've been talking here for like 10, 15 minutes. I know. Doesn't that completely-- That sucks, doesn't it? [chuckles] This is not... I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. [Randy] So blatantly and completely mismatched, and yet they continued to pretend that they liked each other, like they had a reason. [distant siren wailing] For the life of me, I could not figure it out. It was giving me an ulcer. She kept trying to act like she was completely happy or something. Yeah, right. I knew she wasn't. My ulcer got worse that week. I went to the hospital, twice. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Randy, you have to get out of here now. You have to leave. He's gonna be here in like, uh... he's gonna be here in, like, five minutes. You have to get out. Let's go. [hair dryer blowing] [Randy] The city was getting uglier in every way possible for me. I was a warm weather guy in Chicago for the winter. If anything was going to make me leave, it was temperatures below freezing. But I stayed. I followed her day and night in the cold. I didn't even notice it. [traffic passing] God, it was so painfully obvious that they didn't have any kind of connection. What was she doing? Look at that stupid car he drove. And the way they were always touching each other. What's that all about? Listen, I--I got to get upstairs and catch a couple of winks because Michelle's got us going to some damn thing later on. [Randy] George, main guy at the paper. Huh? Heather? Yeah, w--what about her? Ah... And Cliff? I don't know. What about him? [Randy] Jeff covered politics at the paper Oh, you know, Cliff is a nice guy, and--and I'm glad for Heather and Cliff. It's been like a whirlwind romance. They've been going out for about two weeks, but you know, there's one thing that-- that kind of disturbs me. They've--they've been having these public displays of affection. Like, just this afternoon, I was going into the supply closet and--and I caught them in there, and they were engaging in the lust of the goat. [Randy] See, again with the touching thing. What was that? I mean, they didn't need to try so hard. My God. ♪ Michelle, Heather's boss at the paper. This is about Heather and Cliff? Oh, my God. Like, I spend a lot of time thinking about Heather's love life. Um, whatever, she's turning in pieces on time, maybe due to this Cliff person. I don't know. You know what? I've got to go, okay? This is, like, completely a waste of my time. ♪ [Randy] Jacob, the advice columnist. You know something? I am so fucking tired of hearing about Heather and fucking Cliff. Everybody has been talking about them nonstop, and all they do is come to me every fucking day and tell me all of their problems. I don't give a shit. [Randy] Look at him pretending to like her. What a dick. Yeah, snuggle, snuggle. Shut the fuck up. Kelly, bookstore clerk and Heather's friend. ♪ Well, she says it's a healthy relationship. I mean, I understand that, but please, we're talking--we're talking about Heather here. She's a total case. First of all, I know he doesn't meditate. I know that for a fact. It's got to end in a shambles. I--I know it is. [Randy] Marie, buyer from Mason's department store, Heather's best friend. The whole thing makes me want to vomit. I completely caught him staring at my ass the other day, took a long, hard look. I've seen it before. I give him two weeks at the maximum, they're over. [Randy] Ugh, how can she touch him? ♪ I've asked Heather out four times, and every time she said that she wasn't in the "dating" frame of mind. Now here she is dating this guy, Clifford. I mean, if that's the way it's gonna be, if she's gonna date when she says she's not in the dating frame of mind, then--then I don't even want to date her. I--all I want to do is just, uh, fuck her. I mean, does he have money? [indistinct chatter] Either he has money or a really great penis. Is there an office supply store around here? ♪ Waiter? Waiter. [Randy] Every once in a while, I thought she'd spotted me, but she never came over to talk to me. She'd stop returning my calls. I told her I just needed someone to talk to, that I was having some problems with my family. I laid it on as thick as I could on her voicemail. She still didn't call me back. I think that this makes for a really aggressive and almost violent, angry relationship with Cliff. I'm really sorry. Kelly, Kelly. -Yes. -I'm really starving. -I have to go to eat. -I'm in the middle of this. You said this would take a second. It'll be a second more. Her relationship with Cliff right now is especially emblematic of what she's going through with, like I was saying, not being in touch and not letting the breath to come and just... It really disturbs me and bothers me to see her in this sexual, angry, angry relationship with this man, and-- Sorry--Kelly, I need--will you just give me some money? You just made me lose my train of thought again. -Again? -Again, yes. Can you just give me some money? Are you crazy? Get out of here. I'm--give you money? Jesus. [exhales sharply] I'm sorry. Oh! Well, that's--that's a whole other story. But anyway... So I was waiting and waiting and waiting, and all of a sudden, she like breezes in and, you know, she's all unzipped and her buttons are all askew and her hair's completely fucked up. And I mean, obviously, she had just been having sex. And it's like, you know, that's not very respectful of me in the space that I'm inhabiting and my energy. And she comes in, and she sits down, and she's got this look on her face like she just swallowed something. Well, she had, obviously, and it kind of... And she described it, and it made me just lose my appetite completely, completely. And--I mean, as far as he's concerned, I figure he's got to be on some kind of mood-altering drug, whether it's Xanax or Pro--Prozac. I mean, I don't know, but to put up with Heather, I mean, she's a stress case. It's Heather. Kelly, we need to go now. I'm starving. Would you just stop telling me-- I'm so fucking hungry! Would you just let me go?! [Randy] Motherfucking cock-sucking asshole. Dick. Asshole. I kind of didn't like him. It was obvious to everyone what bullshit this was. Everyone she knew was sick of Cliff, angry with her for being with him. They were causing problems for everyone around them, and they were so unhappy together, it brought everyone down. I couldn't figure out why she was doing this, so I had to keep following her. God, I still don't understand why she was doing this to me. Had I done something? Did I miss something? She'd caught me. [traffic passing] [siren wailing in distance] [traffic passing loudly] She probably had to be somewhere in a hurry. On the phone that night, I told her I'd stop following them around. I lied. I paid a kid in my building 50 bucks to carry the sound and follow them. He wasn't as discreet as I would have hoped. [Cliff] Hey, honey. Is that that--is that that guy? It's that guy from the other day. [Heather] Oh, my God. It totally is. [Cliff] What the hell is he doing here? Go talk to him. This--this is weird by the way. It's just weird. Just go talk to him. -Get rid of him. -[Heather] What is your problem? [Cliff] Just do it now. No kidding, this isn't funny. He likes me. Are you gonna stop shooting? Don't, you're fucking everything up! What the fuck are you-- -Sorry. -[Heather] Oh, my God. Are you gonna stop? Stop shooting, okay? Stop. I'll call you tomorrow. What? What is this? What is this? Get... -Sorry. -Get out of here. -Just get out of here. -Calm down. Just get in the car. Just get in the car. Back off. Sorry! [Randy] Jeff--Jeff was as unhappy about Cliff as I was. Every time I called her, I mentioned that I needed to see her because I was having these family problems. She would not call me. It was just wrong of her to leave me out like that. She owed me time and attention. We were friends. I wasn't about to remain left out of her life. I was going to take action. Made myself believe that whatever I did, it would be completely justified, completely acceptable. I could always blame it on my family problems. One night, when she and I were going out every night to pick up guys back in the beginning, she'd realize we were probably gonna be spending a lot of time together since it wasn't working like she thought it would. She thought it was a pain in the ass to have to have the doorman ring me in every time. A couple of days after that, she realized that it was a pain in the ass to have to come to the door to let me into her apartment. She told the doorman to let me in whenever I wanted. And she'd given me the key to her door. ♪ Who the fuck is that? What the fuck are you doing? Do these-- do these guys have a key? [indistinct talking] What the fuck? Get the fuck out of here. Just get him out of here. This is sick. -It's wrong. This is wrong. -And I agree. -I totally agree. -Just get him out of here. If you really wanted them out of here, they'd be out of here. Get the fuck-- get the fuck out of here! I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. No, no, no. ♪ This is not right. This is not normal! [Heather] I'll take care of it. [indistinct talking] You said you weren't going to do this anymore. You promised me. [indistinct conversation] [Randy] She came out again, and we made an agreement. I'd promise to stop following them around if they'd do a last interview with me about the pickup. I still have this documentary to finish. I needed to know why it worked that one time, why he picked up on her, what was going on in his head. The film needed closure. She said she'd get him to sit down, let me ask him some questions. She agreed to all this after I whined to her about my problems again for five minutes. These problems thing was a godsend. I planned a list of 30 basic questions, all having to do with what he was thinking he wanted from her that first night, et cetera, et cetera. The first question was very simple. Was he thinking he was going to fuck her that first night? This is fucked. ♪ ♪ You think you're so good ♪ You think you're so good ♪ I'm sorry.

Get out of the car. [Heather] Get out of the car. I just wanna talk to you for five minutes. [car door slams] [no audible dialogue] [distant horn honks] [Randy] He'd finally done it. He would never return her calls again. That was the day I realized he wasn't such a bad guy after all. ♪ And that week, everything changed for the better. The sun came out and warmed me up again. Life was fantastic and exciting again. I finally felt alive again. Heather and I started spending all our time together. She still wouldn't speak to me for some reason, but we were together constantly. Something told me she might be a little mad at me for the Cliff-dumping-her thing. I knew this was probably just an excuse. He probably had been trying to get rid of her for weeks. ♪ A month went by, and she was still a little quiet around me, but I was nothing if not understanding. She'd miss me if I didn't hang out with her, so we went everywhere. Jack's L stop, went there are a few times. ♪ With her at Jack's apartment, those were good days. They say old wounds open up when you break up with someone. She was the case study for that then. I have no idea whothey are, but they must have had a lot of horrible breakouts. ♪ Sweet, chilly nights outside Jack's office are good nights together. ♪ I was getting used to the fact that she wouldn't talk to me. I was feeling comfortable with it. What did I care? I was getting footage. I loved being with her. She was a blast. We had our most fun waiting for Jack together. Some days, we'd follow him together. That's when we felt closest really. ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah [vocalizing] ♪ And when we went out with her friends, to clubs, to restaurants, bars, whatever... ♪ I stood by her through all the times her boss was mean to her. ♪ Mostly, she loved going to Jack's office. I was always happy to tag along wherever she wanted to go. ♪ The saddest thing was she could do it after humiliating herself again and again. After all that hard work and thought, she'd done it. She couldn't stop it if she wanted to. There was a magnetism suddenly, subtle but undeniable. [indistinct chatter] It wasn't that she'd become more physically attractive. She'd gained 20 pounds, my God, and started smoking. It was that she truly didn't care anymore. She hated all men. All men except Jack. And he wouldn't call her back. She could pick up on any guy anywhere now. The sad part was she did just that. She picked up on them all. -She could do it. -[indistinct chatter] That's what made my ulcer come back. She'd gotten good at it. The better she got, the more it upset me. I think I even cried about it one night. I think she was having sex with some guy she just brought home. [distant sirens wailing] I hoped she'd start talking to me soon, not because I was upset by her being with a guy or something. I was just hoping the ulcer would go away. I knew she was warming up to me again. She'd stopped giving me the finger every morning. Jack figured out that we were following him around. [wailing continues] He wasn't really a very social guy. He always seemed to be in a hurry. [police sirens bellowing] She hadn't been working like she had before. We only went to restaurants when they were dead, and we never went to parties anymore. [indistinct radio chatter] My next door neighbor and I discovered Heather's column had been suspiciously missing for weeks. I assumed she didn't care about her job. Heather. Heather! Goddamn it, get over here. Now. [indistinct conversation] If you do not have your piece on my desk by tomorrow morning, you are fired. Does that get through? Is that getting through to you? -I'm fired? -Yes, you're fired. Why are you following me? So I'm fired. Fine. -I don't want to follow you. -I don't want your coffee. Do you understand why this is happening? Because I don't think you do. Do you know that if I don't get anything from you, I get shit. -You are costing me money. -You know what, Michelle? You cost our-- this paper money. Heather, you know what? If you don't-- [Heather] Will you just go back in the office? I can't fucking deal with this anymore. [Michelle] Fine, Heather! I am serious! [wind gusting] [distant sirens wailing] I think this upset Heather more than Michelle had expected. Oh, my God. Honey, are you okay? Honey, get up. Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Who are you? -[indistinct] No, I don't know. Hold on one second. Are you okay? Oh, my God. Oh, you poor thing. Okay, okay. Hold on, I'll get you. Are you on drugs? Just go and get on-- -What are you do-- -[coughing] I swear, come to the city and it's all-- Get away. Get away! Stop it! Get out of here. [Randy] She got queasy again in a couple of minutes, and this was the ambulance that brought her to the hospital. Helpful hint: when you're shooting your documentary and two cops threaten to take your camera away, stop shooting immediately. I couldn't wait for her to get back the next morning. She'd missed her last-chance deadline. She knew the next time she went into the paper, it would be over. Now she had nothing left. There was an eviction notice on her door earlier in the week. I have no idea how she was going to make her car payment. How stupid to pass out on your last chance to keep your job. No, no, no. I told you don't do this.

You don't even care? How did he get you to do this? Know what? Fuck you, okay? You don't need to put it in my fucking face. [Randy] The following morning, she came out and started speaking to me again. She said something about how she figured I was just as fucked up as she was, and that we might as well go down in flames together. I can't tell you how happy I was. And over the course of the next few days, she broke it all down for me. Any guy would come home with her if she was just a total bitch to him, if she treated him like absolute shit.

She was pitifully sick, and that that was exactly what I liked about her. No matter what she was doing, she was sick. She was sick, she was fat, she was unattractive. She was full of shit, and those were her best qualities. The more time I spent with her, the more I realized how truly odd it was that she and I hadn't slept together. I mean, she'd slept with everyone else in Chicago. What? Was there something wrong with me? Every day, she had to find a new hiding place for her car. The dealership wanted it back very badly. You're fucking sick. You're--that's just... Randy, you're fucking disgusting. [Randy] This was her response to my telling her I was falling head over heels in love with her.

[man talking indistinctly on radio] You're sick. You're fucked up. [Randy] I thought that would be funny telling her that. I wasn't in love with her, really. I told her that to get a reaction. Really, I wasn't in love with her. It was for fun. It was a stupid idea. She didn't really react the way I wanted her to. If I'd known what what was going to happen, I wouldn't have bothered. [indistinct radio chatter] It happened so fast, it took me weeks to get it. An average day, we did average things. She got up and paced around the apartment. And then we went out to follow Jack and Gretchen, and she didn't say a word all morning. The two weeks before that, she hadn't left her apartment once. Not once. And then that morning, she did. And when we found Jack and Gretchen, she suddenly got very focused and clear. [vehicle passes] [siren wailing in distance] -[vehicles passing] -[sirens wailing] I lost track of her after that. I don't know where she went that afternoon. [vehicle passing] She's such a loser. I just wish she would, like, control herself instead of just... I don't even know why I'm here. Well, I mean, is she okay? I mean, no one has told me anything about it. And you know what? I know everyone thinks that I caused this, but I didn't, okay? I am trying to run my business, and I can't help it if she had a nervous breakdown. I mean--they're towing my fucking car. They're towing my fucking car. Hey! [children playing] Strangulation. I mean, that's--that's psychotic behavior. I feel like I've witnessed an American tragedy. I haven't gone to visit her in the hospital because the sight of me would probably push her over the edge. And then the same token, the sight of her would probably push me over the edge. I still feel that someday we'll be married. All I know is she totally wigged out, fucking wigged. -What? -She wigged. She--she followed-- she was following Jack. -No--okay, okay. -She--she-- I'll give you that, but she didn't totally freak out. She saw Gretchen outside with Jack. Yeah, she--where are we? We're in--we're at the hospital. -Yeah, she wigged. -Wasn't she just going to talk to her though, and then, like, some freak accident happened or something? And--she, like, Gretchen-- She strangled Gretchen, okay? -No, no. -She dug her nail into her jugular. -[laughs] -You are such a liar. She dug--I hear she dug her nail into her jugular. No, I-- [children playing] So, uh, she checked herself in, you know, voluntarily, about three days ago, and I just decided to come down here and visit her. Um, I don't know. She's really quiet. She didn't talk about Jack at all. She didn't talk about, like, what brought her here, anything. We just kind of sat there. She, like, sat there in her chair. You're not gonna tell Kelly I was here, were you? She's lost her place. I mean, she's been evicted. And now we have a problem because she has at least two of my dresses that I need. The weather is changing, and I looked for her car. I think the repo people got it because it's gone. Well, I met up with Cliff. We got to talking, and we have a lot more in common than I thought. So we went out once. I think we're gonna probably get together this weekend. I feel sorry for her. She's an idiot. She's a complete idiot. [children playing] I got--I got the story, okay? Okay, she's... -No, what happened-- -What's the story? She went--she went there to talk to her, to Gretchen, okay? And, like, she was helping her with some kind of a light fixture or something. -What? -Gretchen fell off of a ladder. What? A light fixture? Please. I'm serious; that's what happened. She strangled her, she wigged out, then now she ended up here, somehow for no... I don't even know how she got here. [children playing] [Randy] Her insurance company couldn't get her into a rehab on such short notice, so they checked her into a children's hospital. She wanted to go on some variation of Prozac and get some therapy. Somehow, I ended up on the guest list and she let me in. As if things weren't great already, they were amazing now. [laughter] We were at our best when I was filming her every day like that. [laughter continues] [children playing] She escaped. [laughs] I know it's a voluntary hospital. [laughter] [Randy] I followed the pavement away from the hospital hoping to find her. All I found is the train and a Northwestern student at a coffeehouse near the tracks. Yes, she was-- she was cer-- she was wearing her pajamas, you know? And I thought, wow, weird, pajamas. But she comes--she comes-- she does this, like, circle right here. And I'm like--I'm in there. I'm going... Wait, no, wait. She came from this way. I thought she was gone. Then she comes--she's back. She comes in and then she gets-- she got a train and she went. She's gone. [Randy] It only took a minute to understand this was just some kind of game. She wanted me to find her. [vehicles passing] [distant sirens wailing] It was turning out to be a very difficult game. She was really good at this one. I couldn't find her anywhere, and I really looked hard. [musical jingle playing from truck] But I did find Jack. ♪ [no audible dialogue] So, thank you very much for this. And I just stopped smoking, and... [Randy] He finally agreed to talk to me when I offered to buy him another popsicle. ...Especially the eye part. I met her maybe...over summer at one of my clubs. We went out. I asked her out to coffee. Usually I don't do that, but in her case, I did. And it was fun. I had a good time. She was very nice, great, high quality sort of person. We went out a couple of times. Um... [sighs] I really want a cigarette right now. I can't stop thinking about it. Things sort of fizzled. You know, that happens. After about three days, it was over. And wasn't that I didn't like her or anything like that. I just didn't seem to work out. We just weren't clicking together. I stopped calling her, and then she started calling me all the time, which was a little bizarre. One time, I think I--I saw her outside my window, which was--which was strange. Nice girl, but she's sort of freakish in that way. She was calling me as though, you know, we had something more than we actually had. Do you have a smoke, Randy? That Gretchen girl and I finally broke up. I don't know. I drove her crazy, I think. Why are you doing this? ♪ [Randy] Three days. They've only dated for three days.

I had no way of reaching her. I went and talked to Marie, but she didn't have any phone numbers of Heather's family and no one at the paper even knew how to get in touch with them. All I knew was that they lived somewhere in New York. But the girl at the phone company told me there wasn't even a way of counting how many Greens were listed in just Manhattan. This is the trick, to stay motivated, to hang in there. It was hard in the beginning, but I'm still looking. I'm no quitter. She'd gotten on the train, and she was gone in her pajamas.
