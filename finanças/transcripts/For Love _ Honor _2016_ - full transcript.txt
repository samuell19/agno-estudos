♪♪ - Hey, this is Tom Brennan. I'm sorry I missed you, but leave a message and I will call you back. Thanks. Hey, Dad. It's Kylie. How did I know you wouldn't pick up? Working out? Isn't it a little early for that? Ah, warming up with a morning jog, then exercises. You're a better man than me. Uh, I was just calling to see how you're settling in to the new place, because I know how much you love change. Why not take a trip outside of your comfort zone, like losing the barrack-chic look on your new house? When I come to visit, I want to see something a little more sentimental than flags and medals on the walls. OK? Love you. Bye, Dad. - Hey, peanut. "Peanut"? Thought you were somebody else. - That's Major General Peanut to you, Tom. - General Cabot! Thought I recognized that old growl. - It's been almost five years since my last tour of duty, son, so it's just Henry now. - You still heading up the school board at Stone Creek? - I think they just like having a two-star general on the school newsletter. Makes them look legit. - Who are you kidding? You love that place almost as much as I do. - I'm glad to hear you say that, because there's a situation there I'd like to OK, um... How does beers at Callahan's sound? ♪♪ - Hooah. - Hooah, sir. Good to see you. - Stone Creek Academy. : Duty. Honour. Courage. - At ease, Colonel. So... when did you get your marching papers? - Uh, all too familiar story. Mortar shell blew. Shrapnel flew, nailed me in the shoulder. Army handed me my retirement papers three months ago. - Tough break, but maybe it was for the best. - Really? How do you figure that? - Are you going to sit down? - Thanks, Frank. - You're welcome. - Look, I know how hard it was for you after your wife passed away, but would you've really been happy staying on, doing a desk job? - Well, not by a long shot, but I'm not really cut out for civilian life. - You're in a period of transition is all, which, uh, brings me to my proposition. I need your help over at the Academy. The place has been falling by the wayside for years. Enrollment's down to the point where they can barely keep the lights on. - What's the problem? - I wish I knew. The board just hired a new dean of academics to help turn the place around. - And...? - And if I had 100 % faith in her, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - Her? - From San Francisco. Graduate of Berkeley. She's a smart one, but you know, very yogurt and granola. Touchy-feely type. - Non-military. - I think the Academy could use someone from the inside to head up the military program and corps cadets. - General, I... I'm a soldier. I'm not an administrator. - You're a leader. You always were. And if anybody can turn this program around, it's you. - It's not that simple. Fall semester began two weeks ago. They would need me to start yesterday. - Well, that's perfect, because what did you do yesterday? Exactly. OK. What are you afraid of? - Isn't there somebody else you can practice this Psych Major stuff on? I'm already paying for it once. - Ah, that is a very good example of deflection. I love you, Dad. Bye. - Bye, Kyles. What are you afraid of, Tom? - Good morning... Emily, is that it? - Yes, Dean Foster. Good morning. - Morning, Melanie. - Morning. - And what do we have here? - Oh, fight outside, morning reveille. - Ah, so it's going to be one of those Mondays, I see. Send them in. - Will do. Boys! - You both know the Academy forbids physical altercations. But worse, one of you is lying about starting the fight, which is grounds for expulsion. - Hey, you're not gonna get me expelled! - Hey! - It wasn't him. I started it. - I see. Now, if I'm not mistaken, you have an incident on your record at your previous school. - That wasn't my fault! I swear. - Alright, then. Seeing as we are barely into the school year and just getting settled in, I am going to opt for a one-time "boys will be boys" excuse. -: Thank you, ma'am. - If you promise me one thing. You both keep your noses clean. Got it? -: Yes, ma'am. - Mason. I've got high hopes for you. You've got a second chance. Take advantage of it. - Thank you, ma'am. - And please, stop calling me "ma'am." ♪♪ -: Hey, how are you doing? -: Good, how are you? - Why are you so late? What time did you wake up? : Hey, how are you? : Doing well, how about you? - Pretty good. -: English class! - Wait, wait. What's this, cadet? - Uh, my shirt? - "My shirt, sir." More specifically, it's untucked. And where's your tie? - We don't wear ties. - What kind of uniform doesn't have a tie? - This one? - Colonel Brennan, I presume. - What gave me away? - Your... Oh, you were making a joke! Ha ha, sir! Melanie Corbett, executive assistant, Colonel. Quinoa muffin? - Um... - They're organic, gluten-free and sweetened with agave. - Three things I try never to eat, but thank you. - Oh, that's a shame. I made them myself. They're Caroline's favourite. - Caroline? - Yes. You know, Caroline Foster. The new dean of academics. - I know who she is. I'm just surprised you refer to the dean so casually. But I guess things are more laidback than I remember. - Yes. Well, I'm sure you're anxious to get settled in, so why don't I show you to your office? It's a little bare-bones at the moment, but feel free to spruce it up with a little colour, some plants, personal photos... - This is fine. Thank you, ma'am. - Well, then. I've gone ahead and printed you up a list of meetings and activities for the week. Caroline-- Uh, Dean Foster was hoping you could meet her later this afternoon to discuss the upcoming semester. - Fine. Just see if she's available to meet out on the quad at 1300 hours. 1:00. - Oh, great. That's right after lunch ends. - Mm, thank you. - Sorry, dude! - Seeing as this is a military academy, I expected things to start on time. - Please continue. I'm sorry, Colonel. I thought we were meeting to get acquainted, not storming the beaches of Normandy. Caroline Foster. Nice to meet you. - Where I come from, Dean Foster, example's important and punctuality's a part of the code. - OK, then. I was just teaching the cadets here the benefits of yoga. Studies show it helps with concentration. And relaxation. Maybe you should try it sometime. - I'm comfortable just as I am, thank you. - If you say so. Shall we? Anyway, I'm sure you've already gotten an earful about the decline in enrollment from Henry? - Henry? Oh, you mean the General. - Right, I forgot you two served together. I suppose old habits must die hard. - If they die at all. - Right. Well, that's why I was brought on here, to help make the Academy more relevant to a new demographic. - What was wrong with the old demographic? - Parents don't care about the pomp and circumstance anymore. No offense. They just want schools like Stone Creek to get their kids into good colleges. - Well, I was brought in to emphasize code of conduct, character development, discipline. I mean, look at this campus. It's the cadets' responsibility to treat their institution with respect. And how are they supposed to do that with their noses buried in cellphones? On that subject, we're banning electronic devices from campus. - Are you serious? You realize the students do their homework online? Look, I don't necessarily disagree with everything you're saying, but I also don't see how your approach is the only way that we're going to turn this place around. - Do you have a better idea? - Thank you, Colonel. That's the first time you've asked me for my opinion. - Sorry, ma'am. You will find I call 'em like I see 'em. - Well, it's very easy to walk in here, pointing fingers. I've only had a few weeks to settle in and you've had, what, a few hours? Meet the faculty. Get to know the cadets. Take a deeper look around and then come to me with a plan we can actually discuss. Got it, Colonel? - Yes, ma'am. - Great. - It's cruel and unusual punishment that no one should be subjected to. - It's not that bad. It's got the four major food groups: beef, turkey, ham, cheese. - Yeah, I'm not talking about your protein explosion. I'm talking about your "my way or the highway" attitude. Like it or not, Dad, this woman is still your boss. - Technically, we're in charge of two separate divisions. - Well, it sounds to me like she's trying to work with you. - Right. By dismissing everything the Academy represents. - You are so frustrating. Why do you think you're the only person who knows how to do things? - Maybe I am... - Maybe you're not! Can I make a suggestion? - Like me saying no would make a difference. - Put the dimmer switch on that personality of yours. Daddy, don't get me wrong. I love you to bits. But you have a way of making everyone the enemy sometimes. - I don't mean to. - Well, look at you, taking baby steps. You could do that more often, too. Smile? It's not a weakness to show you have a softer side. - Well, I'll give you that. Your mom had a way of getting me to lower my guard. - Well, now that she's gone, maybe you have to learn how to do that for yourself. Or find someone new to help you do it. And up goes that guard again. - Uh... standby colours. ♪♪ - Attention! Some of you look like you just rolled out of bed. - No, sir. - Can somebody explain to me why nobody's heart is in their duty? When I was your age, we had to earn this privilege. - When was that? Vietnam? - That's it, hero. Give me 20. - Sorry. I don't get my allowance until Friday. - Push-ups! That's everybody, on the ground. Let's go! Come on. Let's go, let's go! You can thank Cadet Keller. Real push-ups. - Nothing like starting the day with a little calisthenics. Is that it, Colonel Brennan? - Something like that. The cadets and I are just getting acquainted. - Good, because some of these cadets are the Academy's top scholars, like Emily and Jared. And Mason here actually just skipped a grade. - The wise guy? Flat backs! Knees on the ground, if you have to. Dean, it's traditional to refer to cadets by their last name. - Oh, I don't know. I find that so impersonal. Don't you? I'm actually trying to get them to call me Caroline. I mean, that is my name. Right, cadets? - OK, that's enough. On your feet. Get to class, cadets. Walk with me. I would appreciate it if you didn't contradict me in front of the cadets. How far can you walk in those? - Watch me. For enrollment to grow, I plan on implementing progressive teaching methods that worked at my last job: expanded learning tracks, life skills courses, flipped classrooms... - What's a flipped classroom? Never mind. - We're not in the business of creating soldiers. We're supposed to be shaping minds. - Precisely, and if you truly understood the military model, you would see that discipline fosters a great work ethic that carries over into every aspect of a cadet's life. - And if I respectfully disagree, what? Are you going to tell me to drop and give you 20? - If I thought it would help. - Look, I may not know much about the military, but I do get kids. I know what keeps them motivated to succeed. But I can't do it alone and I also... can't climb this hill. "Can't." It's the most overused word in the English language. It's just another word for quit. - Is that so? - Yes, ma'am. You said, "I can't climb this hill." Yes, you can. Do your feet hurt? Sure, but you can climb. "Can't" suggests it's out of your power. It's not. - Fine! How about this? I'm not climbing this hill in these shoes. - Better. That's a choice. - I really CAN'T stand that man. ♪♪ You wanted to see me, Colonel? - Yes. Can you see if Dean Foster's available for a meeting after lunch? - You mean here, in the war room? I mean, your office? - Dean's choice. - She says she can meet you out on the quad, 1:30 to 1:45ish. "Ish" means somewhere in between. - I am familiar with the term. But tell me, at what point does "ish" just become a blatant disregard for a time commitment? - I'd give it around a half hour. - Good to know. On time, I see. - Actually, I got here a few minutes early, in case you were planning to blitzkrieg. - Perfect. I love a walk and talk. Only this time, it's not a competition. I have a game plan I'd like to run by you. - What's the catch? - There's no catch. We both want the same thing, right? - Well, that depends. You sometimes seem a little bit resistant to anybody's ideas but your own. - Well, people can change. If they... want to. - Hopefully a little more easily than those words coming out of your mouth. - So I've looked around and my first impression still holds. We need to reembrace conduct codes and enhance levels of respect and confidence to up our game. - I'm glad to see you're still sticking with your original opinion. You're consistent, I'll give you that. - Ma'am, you gotta let me finish. Which leads to reinvigorating the school's junior ROTC program, which parents love because of the financial assistance. It appeals to graduates for college. - Ambitious. Do not quote me on this, but I like the way you think. - Well, it's not flipping houses, but it's an idea to put us on the map. - Flipped classrooms, which simply means watching class lectures at home and doing homework in class. - Doesn't that make it classwork? - Listen. I happen to believe that a more personal approach to learning can be just as effective, if not more, than your take-no- prisoners attitude. - Dean, you have to understand in battle, an individual is only as strong as his unit. - We are not in battle right now. - We're always in battle, ma'am. And for the record, your approach sounds like a coddling load of psychobabble. - Psychobabble? You know what, Colonel? We're done here. And to think that I actually complimented you on your ideas. - Idea. I had more, but you didn't let me get to them. - Well, that's because the only way you know how to share them is by barking them out like orders. You know what? I guess it's true what they say. Old soldiers never die... or know when to keep their ears open and mouths shut. - The woman won't listen to common sense. - She's not the enemy, Tom. You need to find a middle ground with her. - Yeah, well, preferably in a different zip code. - There's something you ought to know. I hate bringing it up, 'cause it might not even happen, but it might get you to start thinking differently about your approach. There's talk that Bremner College is going to buy the Academy and tear it down to build a dormitory complex. - Are you serious? - Uh-huh. - You're gonna let that happen? - No one's letting anything happen. But at the end of the day, my ranking means nothing to a bunch of 30-something board members who only salute to the bottom line. - What do I do? - Convince them the place is worth keeping. Increasing enrollment would be a great start, but you need to do it quickly. - Why do I feel like the captain of a sinking ship? - So by giving cadets a choice of watching lectures at their leisure, in-class time can be devoted to exercises, projects or discussions. Yes, Pete? Do you have something to add? - Caroline, while I do think some of your ideas are bold, I'm not sure any of this is going to be the fix you need to turn this academy around. - I agree. Look. The scholastics program can always be improved, but that's not what's ailing this academy. - So what do you think the problem is, Jennifer? - Well, it seems like no one really cares anymore. - Everyone's been getting away with doing a little less and a little less and it starts to snowball. - It wasn't always that way. When I started here, there was a pride in the Academy and everything - duty, honour, courage. - Yes, we've heard. And now? - It doesn't take a mathematician to figure our current class sizes won't translate into a sustainable business. - Look. With all the cutbacks and the rumours that the school is going under, we all figure that the Academy's days are numbered. - And you're all OK with that? Sorry, just curious. - No, none of us want this place to go out with a whimper, but what can we do? ♪♪ - Over here, over here! - 21, ha ha! - Hey, man! - Knock, knock! First untucked shirts, now unmade beds! Do you mind explaining this to me, hero? - It's made. I pulled the covers over it! - You consider this made? You should be able to bounce a quarter off this thing. - I told you, I don't get my allowance until Friday. - I'll show you how to properly make a bed. Watch me and do what I do. You actually have no idea why this is important, do you? It's about order, consistency, attention to detail. - If you say so, sir. - Get your coat. - Wait. You're not going to make me do push-ups again, are you? - Actually... I need your help. I'm trying to find out what you and the other cadets think about the Academy. So you'll have permission to speak freely. - Exactly how freely? Personally, I think most cadets see Stone Creek as a place for parents to send their slackers. - I beg your pardon? - Kids with disciplinary problems. You know, hoping the Academy will straighten 'em out. - I see. Anybody I might know that fits that description? - No, sir. None that I know of personally. - OK. Tell me, cadet. When was the last time the school had an honours ceremony? - What's that? - It's a ceremony that honours cadets who have demonstrated exemplary performance. It features elaborate drills, parades, dress formals... when I was a cadet, the backbone of any military academy. - I don't know. Guess they phased that stuff out after you went here back in the 60s. - I appreciate your honesty, cadet, but it was actually the mid-80s. Permission to speak freely is now revoked. - You know, watching yoga is only half as much fun as practicing it. - How did you know I was here? - Because whenever you're around me, a 21-gun salute goes off in my head. Great job, cadets. I'll see you same time tomorrow. - If you're up for the challenge, I thought maybe... maybe we could try this again. - Should I get my boxing gloves now, or...? - You might be surprised to hear this, but I'm actually easygoing. - About an easygoing as an avalanche. - Try me. - OK. So you really think what's ailing this academy could be solved with your military approach? - I did, but you were right to ask me to take a deeper look around. What? - You just said I was right. Forgive me for basking in a little glory. - Well, don't bask too long. The board is talking about closing the Academy. - So the rumours are true. How much time do we have? - We'll finish the school year for sure, but the deal could be sealed before that, which is why you and I have to find a way to work together. - Agreed. As long as you promise to not bark out ideas like I'm your subordinate. - Roger that. I just ask that you keep an open mind about a more traditional approach. - I'm Zen with that. - Really? - Why do you look so surprised? - Well, you might not be aware, but you can be tough to work with. - Me? ♪♪ ♪♪ Good morning, Mel. - Morning, Caroline. Coffee's just brewed. - Oh, thank you. I suspect today's going to be one of those days, so do me a favour and supersize me. - Oh, if you're hungry, I made something different today. Egg white sausage cupcakes. I'm hoping to find a fan with the Colonel. - Ooh. All protein, low-fat. I bet you've got a winner. Uh, hi. I'm Kylie. - You're Tom's daughter. So glad to meet you. - Wow, he lets you call him Tom! - Not exactly. We've yet to broker a treaty on names. : Trying to pick my battles wisely. - Smart. I think I was 9 before he even let me call him Dad. - What? - Just kidding. - So sir, is it true? You were in the Gulf War? - One of the many places I was deployed, yes. - I heard you were the youngest lieutenant in Operation Desert Shield. And stayed right through the invasion of Kuwait? That had to be epic, huh? - I wouldn't say epic, but... definitely an experience. Where'd you learn all this? - There's this thing called the internet... sir. - Well, why are you asking me questions? If you read it on the internet, it must be true, right? - I meant no disrespect, sir. I was just curious after our discussion. See, I did some research on Stone Creek. - OK. - Did you know two generals from World War II were former graduates of the Academy? One of them even served on the board before he took over the superintendent post at Westpoint. - Didn't realize you were such a history buff. - What was this place like when you went here? - You mean during the War of 1812? There was great pride in being a Stone Creek cadet. We felt like we were a part of something bigger than ourselves, that we could accomplish anything if we set our mind to it. - So do you think you can bring this place back to the way it used to be? - I wouldn't be here if I didn't. - That's cool. I mean, I'd like to see that happen. - Really? That's quite a turnaround from our earlier conversation. Why the sudden change of heart? - Well, after that growth spurt I've been waiting on kicks in, I was thinking about joining the Air Force one day. - Really? Pretty impressive. Future fly boy, eh? That's about the toughest ticket in town. - Do you think I have what it takes, sir? - My dad always said, "You can attain anything you want in life through perseverance." - You really believe that? - I really do. You just need the proper inspiration. Well, if you don't want to get a tardy, you better hightail it to class, hero. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Mm-hmm. - I didn't realize the Colonel actually attended the Academy, but I'd recognize that steely-eyed glare anywhere. - Oh, my goodness. Look how cute he was. - I know! That's a picture of him with my mom. That'd be on the night he finally mustered the courage to ask her out. -: Aw! - You know, you look like her. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - I miss hearing people say that. It's hard to believe it's been almost three years since she passed away. - Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. - Oh... - I had no idea the Colonel was a widower. - So to what do we owe the surprise? I thought you were studying at Bremner College. - Uh, yeah. Yeah... Don't tell my dad, but I took the day off. I think I'm having a case of the June blues. - Look, Kylie, feel free to call me and vent, if you like. Before I got into administration, I spent four years as a career counsellor. - Oh, really? So is that helping when it comes to butting heads with my dad? - It's a day-by-day situation. - Sometimes, minute-by-minute. I thought I heard your voice. What's going on in here? - Oh, didn't you get the memo? It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. - Um, Kylie, I'm afraid you picked sort of a bad time. We're kind of in the throes of it here. I've got a big strategy meeting with the boss. - Oh, I prefer the term "superior officer." - Yeah, no, I totally understand. I just came by to say hi, see your office... - Oh, I can show it to you. It's not very fancy, though. The Colonel here doesn't like to decorate. - OK, let's go! - OK, let's go. : I like her. - Kylie is a lovely girl. You should be very proud. - Well, I can't take all the credit. Her mother did most of the heavy lifting. - I think Kylie would disagree. You can tell just by the way she looks at you. - Um, well, you ready to start brainstorming? - Let's get this party started. I think the key to increasing enrollment is raising morale internally, but also changing the community's perception of the Academy. - I couldn't agree more, but the question is how do we accomplish that in the shortest amount of time? - Well, that's our challenge, which got me thinking about the homecoming dance. - Well, that might stir some interest among cadets, but I doubt it'll blip on the radar with the board members. - You didn't let me finish. Hey. Hey. - Beg your pardon. That's military speak for, "I'm sorry. Please continue." - Thank you. This year, the Academy turns 100, which got me thinking, why don't we host a huge centennial benefit at Scholar Hall instead? - Ah, gotcha. Bring out some alumni, get a lot of free press. - Let's make it a celebration that honours the school as well as the community. And let's give the board a reason not to tear the Academy down. - I like it. - You like it, but you don't love it? - Don't get me wrong. I like where you're headed. I just... I don't think it goes far enough. - I'm sensing a "yet" in my future. I get it. This is all very impressive. - Honours ceremonies are the lifeblood of any military academy. And it's not just handing out ribbons and commendations, it's what's behind them. - And what's that? - Pride. Something this academy is obviously sorely lacking. I mean, a centennial celebration doesn't mean anything if there's nothing behind it to celebrate. Remember, perception is reality. - And so is the bottom line. I imagine this all comes with a pretty hefty price tag. And remember, our goal is to find a way to increase enrollment. - Exactly. And this... this is the key. You don't know what it feels like to earn the Dean's Superior Leadership Award. - But you do. - The honours ceremony's a culmination of academics and discipline. This, this will give our cadets and the faculty something to believe in. Work hard, earn the honour, the rest will follow. I'm telling you, if we can pull this off, every parent out there will be dying to send their kid to Stone Creek. - I feel your passion and I agree with you. This could all be so incredible. - I'm sensing a "but" in my future. - Uh, oh. Somebody doesn't look happy. - How am I supposed to save a school when there's not enough money in the budget to afford a pencil eraser? - Well, hopefully, it's nothing a little beef stew won't take the edge off. - What's going on? Why are you trying to butter me up with my favourite meal? You are not switching majors again. - OK, will you relax? Maybe I just wanted a little father-daughter time. - Well, then, why are there three plates at the table? Dean Foster. - Hi. - Oh, come in. - Thanks for coming on such short notice. - Are you kidding? I welcomed a hot meal after the cold shoulder I got this afternoon. - It wasn't that cold and it wasn't directed at you. I'm just frustrated with the situation. - I know. Welcome to my anxiety. Speaking of which, this bottle is not going to open itself, Colonel. - Tom. That's your name! You might as well start letting people use it. You'll have to forgive my father. He's not used to entertaining. Or mixing business with pleasure. Actually, he hasn't really figured out the pleasure part yet. - Would you like to come in? - I like what you haven't done with the place. - I know. I guess it's the offshoot of living in barracks for so long. I tend to keep things sparse. Old habits die hard. - I heard. If they die at all. At least you didn't paint the outside camouflage. - Oh, no. I have to go back to campus. My roommate, she's locked herself out of our dorm. I'm so sorry. You know what? You guys eat, I'll go, I'll come back as soon as I can. : Wait. You can't leave me here with her. What do you expect me to do? - I don't know! Listen to your guest? That wine isn't pouring itself. Bye, Caroline. - Bye! : Have fun! Just be charming, will ya? - So I take it my idea to revive the honours ceremony is off the table. - No, it could still be on it, if only you had one. No, it's all about weighing our options and deciding on the best course of action. - But because you're the dean, it's ultimately your decision. - That's true. But remember, we said that we would work together. I know you're from a world of leaders and followers, but for me, there needs to be a yin and yang in order to create harmony. - I see. Right brain versus left brain. But which one of us has the right brain? - Time will tell. - What made you decide to be an English major? I imagined you having hippie artist parents who encouraged you to chase rainbows. - Not exactly. You know the photo of that guy sticking daisies into rifles of national guardsmen in protest of the Vietnam War? - Yeah, the guy in the sweater. Don't tell me that was your dad? - No! No, but my dad was there the day that that photo was taken. And that inspired him to become a war photo journalist. And my mother was a schoolteacher. My father respected the men who fought for our country as well as the citizens who objected to it. - Sounds like a very brave and wise man. - Yeah, I wish I got to know him a little better, but he died over Hanoi when I was two years old. - Oh, sorry. - It's silly, really. How is it I manage to miss a man I barely remember? - Some scars run deeper than others. I think maybe they serve to remind us how much the people meant to us. - Kylie told me. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. I'm curious. What's with the F. Scott Fitzgerald quotation? He is a true literary hero of mine. - Just the notion that we never stop pursuing our goals, no matter what life throws at us. - Nothing's impossible till you say it is. - Now you're speaking my language. - Tom, I have been speaking it all along. I can't believe I just called you Tom. Is that OK? - It's fine. Hooah. - I beg your pardon? - Oh, that's a... military expression. It comes from an acronym: heard, understood, acknowledged. HUA. - OK. So it's a good thing? - Yeah, it's a very good thing. - To never giving up. - To never giving up. - Forward march! Come on, guys. You heard the Colonel. This is supposed to be an honour. - Alright, Emily. Let's see some enthusiasm. - Standby! Colours! - Melanie? - Yes. - Kylie called. This must be for the Colonel, no? - Actually, she wanted to talk to you. I guess she wants to take you up on your guidance counsellor offer. - Aw. - Before you go, I know the Colonel wants to speak with you. - You know what? I just really need to clear my mind first. - You already had your one yoga class this afternoon. - Oh, no. There is not a downward dog deep enough to clear what I have off my mind. Tell you what. Tell Tom he can meet me here later, if he wants. Thank you. - "Tom"? ♪♪ - Sleeves, cadet. Melanie, do you have any idea where Dean Foster is? - As a matter of fact, I do. She said you should meet her there anytime after 1800 hours. : That's 6:00. - I'm well aware. Since when do you play pool? - Since when do you ask? I picked up the game in college. Sometimes, I even got lucky enough to win a little weekend funny money playing pool at the decks. - Funny money? 30 years in the service, I've played a little myself. - Really? Maybe you should break. - You sure? - Be my guest. - Don't judge. I've got a bum shoulder from a war injury. - I might know a pose or two that would stretch that out, if you were willing to open your mind to yoga. Corner pocket. - Maybe you're right. But what about opening your mind? - To what? - Your belief that my way of turning the Academy around means teaching all the cadets to be mini soldiers. That's not what it's about. - OK, enlighten me. Side pocket. - The Academy was built on a military model because it teaches self-discipline, confidence, leadership skills. - Great! But what about things like individuality, self-expression, creativity? - One doesn't preclude the other. If a cadet will pay attention to details like shining his shoes or making sure his bed is squared away, he'll also go the extra mile to redo that math equation or reread that Shakespearian sonnet to make sure he understands it. What? Nothing? - I never thought about it that way before, Tom. You're right. Now it's your turn to bask in the glory. Feels good, doesn't it? - Feel better if it would revive the honours ceremony. If I had 60 grand in the budget for dress uniforms. - I'm afraid that kitty is dry. I barely scrounged up enough funds to cover the expense of the gala. - So it's impossible? - Nothing's impossible. What ever happened to all that stuff about "never give up" and "a soldier is born ready"? - Why do I feel like I'm being taken? - We haven't betted anything yet. Come on, soldier. Put your thinking cap on. - We have to change the culture and a renewed sense of pride would improve academics, the perception of the community and thus, donations. - Everyone loves a cause. - Especially one worth fighting for. Change the whole perception of the Academy and up goes enrollment. - I love it! Now the only question is whether I can manage to raise the money for the gala and you can whip the cadets into shape in time for a true honours ceremony. - Wait, seriously? We can do both? We have a deal? - Sure... if I can sink this shot. - Wait! I am not staking the future of the Academy on one shot. - You expect me to have faith in you. How about a little faith in me? - Fine. Take the shot. Did it go in? - Hooyah. - Well, I have to admit, I haven't been hustled like that in a long time, Caroline. What? - That's the first time you've called me Caroline. - Is that OK? - It's better than Dean Foster. Or ma'am. - OK. Well, Caroline, I've been meaning to say that dinner the other night was fun. I mean, I had a good time. I haven't felt like that in a while. - I had a nice time too. - Well, good, then maybe we should do it again. I mean, if you're up for the idea. - Are you asking me out on a date? - I guess I am. I'm sorry, it's been a quarter century since I asked a girl out and I'm a little rusty. But yes, I would like for us to go out on a date, a real date, and see what happens. - What do you think is gonna happen? - I'm not sure, but it cannot be more awkward than it is right now. - One can hope. Yes, Tom. It's a date. - Hooah. - Hooyah. - No, I said simply hooah. - That's what I said. - No, you said "hooyah." Said it that way earlier too. - No, I didn't! - Just say it for me again. - Hooyah. There. I said it right that time. - Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Come on, Keller! Pick it up! Cadets! Fall in! Move, move, move! Colonel Brennan, sir. - Mac. - Attention! - So cadets, I know that Sergeant McAllister has informed you of our plan to revive the honours ceremony here at Stone Creek. Formulating the plan is the easy part. Executing it will require diligence, persistence, determination. And we only have a short time to reach our goal, so the Sergeant and I are going to push you to master some elaborate drills that you'll need for the ceremony. I'll also be assigning ranks, including Battalion Commander. - That's why I recommend you all be at your best! Cadets! Fall out! - Colonel, sir. If possible, I would like to be considered for rank of Battalion Commander. - That's a lot of responsibility. A position typically assigned to seniors. You really think you're up for the challenge? - Yes, sir. I just want a chance to prove what I can do. - A big change from the young man with the untucked shirt and the attitude. - People can change, sir. They just need the proper... inspiration. - Tell you what. I will take it under advisement. - Thank you, sir. ♪♪ - Yes, $3000 is very generous and will go a long way, but... $5000 would go even further. I understand. No, thank you so much for your generosity. Bye. Kylie, hi! Come on in. Lovely day. - Are you sure now's a good time to talk? I know you're in the thick of it at the Academy. - I have been on the phone all day calling for donations and I would love a chance to rest my voice and put my ears to work. Tea? Are you still thinking about dropping out of school? - I thought about what you said, but I can't explain it. It just doesn't feel right anymore. And I feel like I'm just wasting my time and my dad's money on tuition. - Have you talked to your father? - Oh, forget it. Have you met my father? On a good day, he's listening-challenged. But I shouldn't be afraid of doing what I think is right for me. I mean, if school's not it, then that should be my decision, right? - Are you asking me what I think, or do you want me to tell you what you want to hear? - I guess both. - It sounds to me like you've already made up your mind. And if that's the case, I'm not the person you should be talking to. - He's gonna hit the roof. - Look, Kylie. If you want your father to respect you as an adult, then you gotta treat him the same way. ♪♪ - I don't remember the last time I went out to dinner like this. Usually it's takeout or me with a can opener. - I suppose we all have our little habits that slowly become our creature comforts. - Exactly. - I know for me, with every new job I tend to over-pack. I bring pillows and bedspreads and pictures. It's like I'm going on tour with Caroline's Greatest Hits. - Reminds you of home? - Yeah... When I think about it, in the last 10 years, I have lived in six different cities. But who am I talking to? I'm sure you've had to make home in the harshest of circumstances. - You get used to bringing a little piece of home with you wherever you go. I always carried this little crayon hand drawing that Kylie did for me in the first grade. I don't know what it was about that silly old picture, but it gave me so much comfort when I was missing 'em the most. - I can't imagine being that far away from your family was easy. - Oh, I suppose every life has its sacrifices. It's just a matter of finding the right balance. - Now you're speaking my language. I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I just don't know if I want to spend the rest of my career bouncing from city to city, living in extended-stay rentals. - What do you want? - I'm afraid that's a work in progress, but I promise to let you know the moment I figure it out. - Deal. - This is nice, Tom. - Yeah, it is. - No, I mean this. You and me. - Oh, good. I was afraid I was boring you with all my stories of "enlisted man: the early years." - Maybe not all of them. I'm just kidding. That reminds me... I almost forgot. I have a gift for you. - Really? - It's just a little something to keep your spirits lifted during our fundraising efforts. I've had it for the longest time. I can't even remember where I picked it up. - Thank you. You know who said this, don't you? - I do now. I actually just looked it up recently, in fact. Winston Churchill. - Maybe we're not so different after all. - Told ya. - Permission to kiss you, Dean Foster? - Permission granted, Colonel. - He's something else, our Colonel, isn't he, Dean Foster? - Yes, he certainly is. - I know it's none of my business, but is the Academy close to reaching our goal? - We're... getting close. - Well, about that. See, I was researching a list of the Academy's former graduates. Did you know Senator Whitman from Pennsylvania attended the Academy in 1966? - No, I didn't. - His family comes from Whitman Industrial Group out of Philadelphia. - I see. Very wealthy, I presume. - Exactly. The Senator might be a good man to turn to for help. - Real subtle, cadet. I knew I had a good feeling about you. Now, shouldn't you be at drill practice? - On my way, ma'am. ♪♪ - Keep it tight! Keep it tight! Come on, Keller. Colonel Brennan, sir. - Sergeant. How are we doing? - It's coming together, sir. - Come on, Keller. You should have this by now. - I'm sorry, sir. I'm trying. - Understood. Try harder. - I just can't seem to get it. - I don't want to hear "can't." Ever. Just strike that word from your vocabulary. That goes for all of you. We're running out of time to nail this routine down. - Alright, guys, let's go! - You should give them some slack. They're all trying their best, sir. - Unless we come up with the rest of the money for the dress uniforms and the real equipment, there is no honours ceremony. I know he's got it in him. Was there any backlash from the seniors for giving him the post? - No, not at all, sir. They're all rooting for him. Plus, they know he's the smartest kid of the bunch and he's been dealt a rough hand. - How so? - Father out of the picture. Minor disciplinary issues at other schools. The mother probably sent him here 'cause she doesn't know what else to do with him, sir. - Caroline, what's wrong? Listen. I'm sure we'll find the money somehow. - It's not even that. I just got off a call with Henry. The board is about to vote on whether or not to turn the Academy over to Bremner. - And...? OK. Well, that's out of your hands, though, right? You can't control the future of the school. You can just deal with the present. - Maybe you're right, Melanie. Maybe we can give those cadets and this place a last hurrah they can be proud of! - Now that's what the Colonel would say, right? - Or... - Where are you going? - To talk to a certain Senator. Here's hoping Stone Creek holds as special a place in his heart as it does a certain Colonel. ♪♪ I really appreciate you taking this meeting with me on such short notice, Senator. - When my assistant said it was about Stone Creek Academy, I must say my ears perked up. I always had quite fond memories of my time there. - I'm not sure if you're aware of the dire circumstances surrounding the Academy's future, but I've made it my mission to keep the school alive. - The Edgefield Foundation is stretched out to countless organizations and causes. The question boils down to simply how many zeroes and commas are between what I'm willing to offer and what you need to survive. - What if I told you that what I need from you is more valuable than zeroes or commas? : Hi, Tom. I'm sorry. The board voted 10 to 1 to turn the Academy over to Bremner College after the school year. Thank you for doing your best. Bye-bye. - Hi, Dad. - Kylie! - Nice sofa. - Everything OK? - That depends on how you look at it. - Well, that doesn't sound very promising. - We need to talk. - OK... - And promise me that you will try to listen. Look, I know this is probably going to come as a bit of a shock, but I've decided to drop out of Bremner at the end of spring semester. This is where you yell. - This is the new Dad. I listen first and yell later. So you want to drop out of college? And do what? - OK, well, don't laugh, but I think I want to take a year off and travel Europe. - Do what? - I don't know! Experience new cultures? Use my advanced French for something other than ordering duck à l'orange at a restaurant? Or maybe I'll just use the year to figure out what I actually want to do with my life, because it's clearly not happening at Bremner. - It's not happening in Europe, either. - I knew this was a mistake. - Bye. We'll pretend we never had this conversation, because you are staying at Bremner till you graduate. - Did you not hear a word I just said? ♪♪ - Whoa. - Wow. It's a parade rifle. - Looks so real. - Well, are you just gonna stare at it? Try it out! - Hey. - Hi. - What's the matter? - Henry left me a voicemail telling me that the board approved the sale of the Academy. - You're kidding. - Which I guess means that you will be moving on to a new job soon. - Tom... - And Kylie came down to tell me she's dropping out of college. - Oh. And how did that discussion go? - Not well. She told me she wants to take a year off to trek through Europe and find herself. And I said good luck getting my support for that search and rescue mission. - Do you want to talk about it? - Ah, not much to talk about. I reacted, she reacted and stormed out. - Well... maybe Kylie taking an academic leave isn't the worst thing on the planet. - Did you know about this? - Well, we spoke about it, but I told her to talk to you. - Why didn't you just convince her to run off to some commune and sing Kumbaya? - Wait a minute. You don't think I talked her into this? - No, of course not. I'm sure it's my fault. If I weren't so rigid and regimented, she might find me more approachable. - Hey, hey, hey. If you would stop beating yourself up for a minute, maybe I can help you out with this. - Just... I'm sorry. Just stop. I can't do this right now. - "Can't"? I thought you struck that word from your vocabulary. ♪♪ -: Sir. - Morning, cadets. - Present arms! - At ease, cadets. - We've been up half the night. Pretty impressive, huh, sir? - With your permission, sir, I'd like to take the cadets outside to drill before class starts. - Carry on, cadet. - Fall in! - I'm proud of you, son. - Thank you, sir. - Working! - How did you do it? How'd you come up with the money for the uniforms? - Don't ask questions you don't want answers to. I fronted the money for the uniforms with the school budget I set aside for the gala. I guess the formal term would be misappropriation of funds. - Caroline, you shouldn't have. - I wasn't about to disappoint those cadets. Or let them parade themselves out in their student uniforms. They earned this. - Well, I'm not about to leave you hanging. Do you have any ideas where we can find the money for the gala? - That's my problem, remember? Your job was to whip the cadets into shape. - You don't want my help? Look, if this is about last night, I... I'm sorry. I was in a bad place and I might have directed some of it at you. Might have? I can only imagine how Kylie must feel. Have you thought about how you plan on fixing things with her? - Ball's in her court. I just know I'm not about to sit around and watch her make the biggest mistake of her life. - No, you're gonna stand here with your arms crossed, feeling justified. - Don't tell me you agree with her. - It's not about agreeing. Right or wrong, this is about Kylie needing you now. You once told me people can change. Maybe now is the time to show it. - Why is it these don't pop in like the picture on the side of the printer? I don't understand. Oh. Well, of course for you it works. Thanks, Colonel. Caroline's resume. I know. I mean, I'm not supposed to know, but I know. It's sad, you know? - I do. - Uh, sorry, pal. Your dean already called and hit me up for a donation. I'll tell you what I told her. Charity begins at home. - I'm not looking for a donation. I'm looking for an investment. - Come again? - Do you have any idea how many parents and community members are going to come out and help us celebrate the Stone Creek centennial? I just think it's a shame that when the whole town comes out on Saturday, the name they're going to see plastered on every program and every banner is McGinty's Grill. - McGinty's? That place is a town over, in Lewiston Falls. - I know. Just think what that's going to say to your loyal patrons in Stone Creek. - Hold on there, soldier. - Colonel, that's incredible news. Are you sure you don't want to tell Caroline yourself? - No, I'll leave that to you, if you don't mind. - OK. - I have something else I have to take care of. - Well, looks like you can scratch food and catering off the list. The Colonel just got Callahan's to cater the entire affair. - What? The whole thing? - He must be pretty persuasive, that Colonel. - I'll say. - Oh, I almost forgot. That just came for you. The Colonel had it sent over. - If he thinks he's going to have me spinning rifles, he's got another thing coming. ♪♪ - Oh, hey, Cara. - Oh, hey, Colonel Brennan. - I heard Kylie was up here. Have you seen her? - Um, yeah, actually. She's right over there. - Um, thanks. You're not going to make this easy on me, are you? Look, I'm sorry for how I reacted. You were right. I do try to control everything. But last night, I started to realize that it is not getting me anywhere. I guess it's like... how I shut down every time you mention your mom. I suppose somewhere in my head, I think if I don't talk about it, then I won't feel the pain of her not being there anymore. But when you told me you were dropping out of college... ...all I could think of was, what would your mom say? What would she do? But that's not what came out of my mouth. All I could think of was... I just wanted to put life on hold. The truth is, I don't know what's right for you... ...any more than I know what's right for me. All I know is... ...you'll always be my little girl. - Dad, I love you. But I'm not your little girl anymore. - Gotta hand it to you, Dean Foster. You've made us all proud, me especially. - Well, I'd be lying if I said the journey's been easy, no guts, no glory. - Halt! - Present arms!

And if I'm accepted, which Caroline thinks I stand a pretty good chance, I'll be able to study abroad for a year and work on the weekends to pay for the extra cost. So what do you think? - I think... I'm happy if you're happy. And this makes me very happy. - Yeah, me too. Don't take this the wrong way, but yesterday was very unlike you. I think she's really good for you, Dad. - Get out of here. - Tom. - I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - Not at all. This is Denis Hibbert, from McAdden Girls' Academy in Connecticut. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - He's heard about all the great things that we've done here at the Academy. - Well, Caroline likes to share credit, but she's the one that managed to turn this place around. You'd be... you'd be lucky to get her. - That's quite an endorsement. All we ask is that you consider us when things wrap up here. - Thank you. I will. - Sir. - Tom! Have you met Senator Whitman? Class of '64. - Ah, nice to meet you. Welcome back. - Dean Foster was kind enough to pay a visit to the Senator and make a plea on Stone Creek's behalf. - She asked me to push through legislation to have Stone Creek declared a historical landmark. - Some things are more valuable than money. - Based on what I've seen here today, I'm making it my mission to see that happen. - So with the Academy a historical landmark, it can't be destroyed or altered in any way? - That's right. - Thank you, Senator! - I'm sure the board won't be pleased about this, but I'll make a strong bet that this will translate into job security for you both. That is, if you want it. - I do. - I do too. - Great news. The Stone Creek Academy server is down because there's been so many hits over enrollment. Same thing with the office voicemail. I wouldn't be surprised if the waiting list was full by spring! - Can I hear a hooah? - Hooah! - Hooah! - Hooah. - Perfect. - I've been practicing. - Senator, sir, thank you. Would you excuse us for a minute? ♪♪ - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - You are pretty amazing, you know that? - So I've been told.
