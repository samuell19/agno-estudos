Jos Stelling Film Production presents The Pointsman based on the novel by Jean-Paul Franssens Frozen? I'll bring a blanket That's me There is a woman in your bed That's something... Where is she from? What's her name? Degoutant (disgusting) Who? Degoutant ! I know who she is. I had a friend once. One night... he put all the money he had into his pocket... and left home. The streets... the squares... were empty. He came to a large house... that he had often passed by before... and came in. There were mirrors and lamps everywhere... Hundreds of them... really beautiful! There were small rooms upstairs... Small glass waiting rooms... Some grand-looking men were sitting there. Everything was red and it was very hot. Nice music was playing... It was coming from everywhere. Violins... Then... a beautiful woman descended the stairs... A stunning woman. She had a large red mouth... She was smiling invitingly... at all these men in the glass rooms. And at him too. The men were clapping their hands and shouting. The bids were going up and up, up and up! The young woman took his hand and ushered him upstairs Upstairs she took him... alongside a long corridor. And I saw in the mirror... that she was waiting for me in a small room. And then the music started again. It smelled of fresh moss. Your ticket please. Can anybody tell me what she's doing here? Can't she speak? Is she deaf? Are you deaf? Where is she going? No, no, madam, that's not our business. Please don't get nervous. I'll have to draw up a report. You will have to leave! Forbidden! This is not a station! Out! She can go with you. I'll draw up a report. I have an official letter for you. She probably lives in a city. You'll get into trouble... Give her some money and send her away! The mailman has a grudge against her. I'm warning you... He'll eat your sweets too! You know, this is the last time I'm here. Too bad there will be no more trains. Get lost! And the woman... Too bad! See you around! It's damp here! It smells of fresh moss. Coffee? OK. I'll have a cup. Time to go! The last train... That woman also wants to leave. You see... I have to say... All right, let's move!
