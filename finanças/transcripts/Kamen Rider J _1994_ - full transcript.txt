That year, unusual weather patterns occurred around the planet. As the end of the century approaches, the earth is in danger. Among the sinister signs, which seem to be controlled by a mysterious power, a hero is born. And a battle is about to commence. KAMEN RIDER KAMEN RIDER J Come forth. Come forth! My divine children who shall rule the galaxy! Come forth! Let your first cries of delight resound! Fog Mother, a mechanical beast from outer space, has come to Earth. She is in the middle of a great hatching that happens once every 1,000 years. Once the prayer ceremony and ritual sacrifice have been completed, Tens of thousands of eggs will hatch. Then, Earth will be attacked by countless monsters. And it will only be a matter of time until all life is wiped out. The prayer has ended. Now we must choose a sacrifice. -Kana! -Hey, Big Bro! - Here's some hot coffee! - Thanks. you shouldn't be out walking around at night. Okay, okay. I'll go back soon, so don't worry. Here! -Is it good? - Yes. Did you take a lot of pictures today? How about this one? No. The smaller one is a more suitable sacrifice. Let us go. -It's gone. - Hey, what's that? What do you want? - Big Bro. - Let's go. - Help me! - Kana! Is he dead? What a weak creature. Fog Mother, we have found a sacrifice for the ceremony. As for the other creature, -did you get rid of it? - Yes. -Garai -Yes. -Agito. -Yes. -Zu. -Yes. Start the preparations for the ceremony. Your brethren will be joining you soon. Understood. Kana! She was kidnapped by Fog. It is most unfortunate. You died. Therefore, we revived you. I died? Who are you?! -We are spirits of the earth. -What? We live deep underground. We live off of the spirit energy of the land. Fog has their sights set on Earth. Fog? The ones who attacked you! They came from outer space. Don't be alarmed. That grasshopper is our connection to the outside world. Introduce yourself. I'm Berry. Nice to meet you, Warrior of J-Power. J-Power? Warrior? The only ones on the planet capable of battling... and defeating Fog are warriors who wield J-Power. J-Power is the power of the spirits. You have been reborn as the strongest... warrior, Kamen Rider J. I'm... Kamen Rider J? Koji Segawa. You felt the pain of the planet. We decided that you are worthy of the role of Kamen Rider J. Wait! Why don't you two fight? Don't you have that J-Power? We live in the earth. We cannot live in the light above the surface. That's why you're here? I feel a strange gathering of energy! Something's wrong! That creature's supposed to be dead! It hurts! This is terrible! The mountain is dying. There was a large-scale development here. There are dead animals everywhere. -I sense Fog's presence! -What? J, you must transform! - Agito is dead. - What? There's someone on this planet who can kill Agito. Interesting. I think I'll have a little fun. Wait, Prince Garai. Let Zu take care of the nuisance. You continue the preparations. As you wish. Leave it to me. Kana. I came to this mountain to research the pollution of the lake. What are you doing? I'm making graves. Graves? Everything's dead. The birds, squirrels, and even the bugs. Do you want to place a flower? So that was Fog Mother?! They were after me. Kana got caught in the middle of it all. Hurry, J. You must help Kana right away! Or else she'll be sacrificed! I'll never let them. Be careful. Once you're past the fog, you're in their territory. J, let's find another way in. No, we're going straight through! J! J, that is Fog Mother's battleship. Kana is somewhere inside. Watch out! Garai! Garai! An unfortunate loss. Why did you survive? Are you not from this planet? The creatures of this planet die so easily. Their cries bore me. Give her back! No matter how hard you try, you can't stop what will happen to this planet. What?! About 70 million years ago, It was the age of the dinosaurs. Fog Mother came to the planet... and had a birthing ceremony. The dinosaurs were devoured by the tens of thousands of newly born monsters. And thus, the dinosaurs went extinct. I have returned after such a long time away. And there is so much food to devour! Wonderful. Such a bountiful planet! It is very fitting to be my kingdom! I'll stop you! Kana! Kana! J! J! Kana! Big Bro! Help me! Kana! -Help! -Kana Kana! Help me! That creature should be honored. After all, she was chosen to be a sacrifice for Fog. Henshin! Kamen Rider J! Big Bro! Kana! Big Bro! Help me! Rider Kick! Kana! Help me! Big Bro! The spirit energy is getting more powerful! What are you?! How dare you... What have you done to my children?! You shall join me in death! Kana! Big Bro! Big Bro! Thank you, J. Hurry up!
