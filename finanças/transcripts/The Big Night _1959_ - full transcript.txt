THE FINE NIGHT Hey, are you free? - You see me here, don't ya? Long live freedom! - Bring your sister here! Come here! Come here! - What do you want? - Come here! Get back on your shelf! There she is! Tell me something, Filomena! What were you doing last night? Who were you dogging? Where were you? Who were you with? I like that. Who was I with? With who I feel like! Why, who were you with? Nice way to carry on! Stealing others' customers! If you didn't steal customers even your tapeworms would die of hunger. Pathetic! Nobody has supported you for a year! Did you think the word wouldn't get around? Let me hear the rest of it! Go on! Go on! Shameless slut! You'll die of hunger in the end! You know I have those who tell me everything and my customers wouldn't even look at a ugly hag like you! Who are you, the queen? They must only go with you? I'm not wearing a collar around my neck. I'll stay here and go and come with who like, like I always do. But tell me something, tell me now that you're running your mouth.. What did you tell them? What did you say? That I'm in the habit of stealing wallets and if possible, even a little blackmail? Now, deny it! Deny it! What! Who do you take me for? Watch it, I'll rip your hair out! - Yeah, you're trembling now.. Starting tonight, if you want to work, find another plaza, because you won't step foot around here again. Got it? I was planning on staying for two hours, now I'll be here four! What are you going to do about it! Here, a flower for you! Let go, don't touch me! Looks like they're fond of each other! Maybe they're sisters? Girls, go for the eyes! Let's find two others. Sparks, we're taking these. Let's not waste anymore time. End of first round! One minute rest. You're killing each other, yet you're friends! Why are you interfering? We can settle this ourselves! You'll kill her for a 1,000 lire? I'll pay you for that. What do I care about your money? I'll rip her open! I'll cut her up! And you shut up! - Walk! Let's go! Hurry! Don't go crazy again, or we'll lock you up! And then, what will you do? - Yeah, yeah, lock me up! I didn't really want to dirty myself with her. Lowlife! How you gave it to her! Are you going to be reasonable now? Is this car going to drive itself? - Come on, we got no time to lose. No, I'm not going with that pig! - Don't start again! I don't want anything to do with her! - Be good! Be good! I want to get out! I want to get out! Get out then and see what happens! You're still here? Didn't you get off? Listen, jerk, If I start screaming, the entire roman police force'll be here! Be nice, fool or we'll give you something that'll have them cracking up for a week. What is that? Somebody die? Where are we going? To a funeral? OK, in a little while there'll be fireworks, wait here and be good. We'll be back in a sec. Giacomo! Who were the bells ringing for? - Who died? Someone who smokes no more. Here, smoke. Have you ever seen them before? No, who would know them. I bet we're here to cover up something. This car is probably filled with stolen goods! Why not the car too? You'll see. They arrest everybody round here. I'm scared! I have a clear conscience! You know they should compensate us for the risks. Yeah, or else this stinks! I just spoke to him on Sunday.. - So much misfortune, sickness, theft, crime, suffering, death.. Just read the papers: "Husband kills wife." "The count throws a masked ball." - "Father dies of hunger." Can you tell me why? - Why? That's life. One day, I'll come looking for you, "Is Sparks there?" And your mom will go, "Sparks is dead!" - And who'll cry for me? I think on the day I die, They'll put me in a cart, and dump me by the cemetery! I want to piss everybody off, even when I'm dead! Take two pieces of wood, make a cross and there you go! At least, we wouldn't have to worry about the money we owe. - We oughta.. get rid of all that stuff. I don't have a lira! The hell with it all! Doesn't Mosciarella live here? - I think so. Maybe he's dead! - He picked a great day for it! It's the grandma. Life is beautiful! Where is Mosciarella? Poor thing! He's having a bite in the kitchen. He hasn't eaten in two days. I was hungry. Who told you? Do you want some? - Thanks, we've already eaten! This kind of thing should never have happened. We had a long chain of troubles. One after another. And now this has to happen to me! What can you do? - Yeah.. Can you talk with us for a second? Why? - I know this isn't a good moment.. but we'll be done in two minutes. - Go ahead, I'm listening. Down below.. there's a car with certain goods. What kind of goods? - An arsenal. The priest has arrived. - Hold on, I'm coming. See you tomorrow. Mosciare', this is a bargain. - Tomorrow morning. My Emma.. And they say the dead don't interfere! Calm down. Calm down. How beautiful she is! Mosciarello, let's finish it! You want to ruin us? You see her? You see her? We'll see you when you return from the cemetery. Didn't you understand me? I told you: tomorrow! - Please.. Please, let's leave. It's time. We need the money! - Do I have to sing it? Tomorrow. Can't you see what my situation is? - We see, goodbye! Psst! Over here! What is it? Just a second, I want to talk to you. No luck? That doesn't matter. What do you want? - I'm a friend of Mosciarella and you can trust me. Come here. Listen, if I get a cut, I'll sell it, no matter what it is. To people you can trust? - I think so! OK, but be careful where you take us. They'll take the stuff and forget who you are. Someone from the law, get it? Let's go then. We have no time to waste. This stuff is hot. - I know, I know, relax. Let us introduce ourselves. I'm Gino, known as Pretty Boy. Ruggero. Sparks. - A pleasure. Then you want to come with us? Why not? Who wants to go to a funeral? Have you made up your mind? - Alright. They're leaving! Run! What? Are the police here already? What can you do.. - Hey, are you leaving like that? Why, were you renting us by the month? - You could've at least said goodbye! Where did these come from? - Look at this sweet thing! Can I buy him? - It'll be me buying you, moron! If you don't get lost, I'll kick your ass! Got it? March! Hey, you don't scare anyone. Got it? I'm really sorry, I couldn't go to the funeral. Never mind, I'll go next time. Hurry up, Pretty Boy! - Give me a moment, OK? Move it! - Relax! What, am I going to my death? Who is it? - The Ladies of Charity. You have a dancehall here? - Yes. Isn't the patient here? - Over there. At least it's not stuffy in here! What are you playing? The fakir? Sleeping? What is it? I've some good stuff for you to sell. Forget it, I don't want to hear it! Give me a break and open your eyes. Can't you see the state I'm in? I'm not getting up because I can't even afford cigarettes. Then, it's nothing doing? - Yeah, give me a kick in the head. I get it. Bye! - Bye! I was just thinking that in a little bit, we were going to have another war. Well then? Well, how did it go? I should slit his throat! His house is full of stuff. He just unloaded a truck yesterday and he said he needs to sell that first.. Too bad, he pays well! Well done! If you can't do it, why poke your nose in it? You wasted our entire day. Where do we go now? Where? I should kill you, twat! Beautiful! You think people are just waiting for you with open arms? Those days are over now! Today it's harder to sell than steal! Shall we start charging by the hour? - You're fine there! - Calm down! Seems they're friends again, and now they're shouting at us. They'll be selling that stuff next year, at Christmas! If they don't sell, where'll they get money? Under a rock? And who'll pay us, the government? I'm not moving unless they pay me up front! Of course. Why don't we take them to the deaf guy? - The one in Fiumicino? Why not, we have a car! Refugees, come here, I wanna tell you something. I'll rip her head off.. - Knock it off! Let me explain: Do you want to sell your loot? What loot? What are you talking about? Don't act like a baby, you think we were sleeping? It's not the first time we've been used to cheat the police! Speak when you're spoken to. - Knock it off, hoodlum! That's what you get for trying to help! Let them do it themselves and go hang! They'd better pay, or I'll show them what I can do. See, I don't get welfare and I don't like these little strolls! If you want to sell it, we'll take you there. And we're not just jabbering, like this one! What do you mean? Where is this place? - At Fiumicino. Good night! Might as well go to America! Then we're good to go, boys! To Fiumicino. Fiumicino is just 10 minutes away! Leave it to me, I'll drive. Get in, let's go! Come, get in. - Let's give it a try. If this fails too, we'll drown ourselves. At least we'll get a bath then! - Yes, you should get one! Are you pissy because you're still not married? Be happy, don't worry! We had to pick these ones? And you, up front, what are you doing? Going straight to the funeral? Every time I pass through here I have to laugh! I remember a rich peasant who came down from the mountain, filthy rich. He had a wallet full of coins that weighed as much as a chest! I really tried to steal some money, but it just fell out of my hands! Damn, don't have you any remorse? Where is your heart? My heart didn't do it! My hand did! You're a slut! God, I bet this one is dead too! He probably turned on the gas! Don't freak out, wait. Remain calm. Why bother shouting? He can't hear you. - What is this, the wizard's house? A holiday resort! Is anybody there? - He's dead. Wait, someone has to be here. - Hey, anyone home? Who can get inside? - Leave it to me, I'm like a cricket. Someone should be here! - Anybody there? Is anybody here? May I come in? Is anybody in the house? Excuse me! Police rifles, understood? He didn't understand anything! Where did you buy this one? You wear it well, my love! Hey, Marc Antony! My mother gave me both a tongue and ears! What do you want here? - Allow me? Pretty Boy. My pleasure, Nicoletta. Listen, Nicoletta, tell the deaf guy two of your friends are here. Supplizia and that other half-crazy girl. They have some stuff to sell, and they're in the car. Pretty Boy! What is he doing? Wait! You wanted to kill her and now you're together again? What can I say? Money changes everything! Hi, honey! Come on, get inside! Suppli', I have to get to Rome later. You have space for me in the car? Any space! We won't refuse this kind of baggage. He can't hear me at all, he's deaf as a bell. Is that Indian sign language? Are we doing business or not? Calm down. He wants to know what you're carrying first. It's down the road, one moment. 15, 20, 25, 30.. Oh, Lord, what a lot of money from a deaf-mute and nothing for me, Pretty Boy! A hundred. Sparks, you hold it. OK, take me back to Caracalla. Quick, let's go! Nicoletta, come on! You want to move it? Said the blackbird to the blue tit: "if you're deaf, you won't hear shit!" Goodbye, you deaf coot! Hurry up, slugs! Blessed be that life smiles at you. Listen to Frank Sinatra! Stop! - What is it? Where are you going? You're crazy! - Ruggere'! A little perfume, it stinks in there! - He's got that right! Have you seen those flowers? Beautiful! Nicole', does the mute like these too? Eat them for dinner tonight. - It's all grist to the mill! They're beautiful though, smell. - Like I'm here for the flowers! Here, I stole them for you. - You're spoiling me rotten, love! What are we doing? Returning without even a kiss? Who said that? We could always have just a picnic, right? Pretty Boy, take a short cut! Quick, kids! Everyone to the swamp. Wait a moment! It's best we come to an agreement. I've lost the whole day, you must give 10,000 each. We even helped you sell stuff. - Don't worry, we're good boys. I'll see if I can take your word for it. - Walk! I'm short on money. We'll have some fun and then.. Let's go! - Like always, eh? Come on, move it! Come on, Nicoletta! They want to pull a fast one, they want to cheat us! Let's show them who we are. - They're coming! Oh, look at the pretty cows! Come here, he wants to speak to his beauty of love, your Sparks! Hey! Let's turn back, where are we going? - To get some fresh air. Feel how nice it is, you can feel it all the way down to your feet. How I like the country with its daisies.. - Where are we going? Come down, come! What am I going to do with you, Nicole'? How sweet! What's going through your head? - Let's take a shower! I'll get all wet! - So what? This is crazy. - Come on, move it! The air and clean! How nice it is here! Come, let's lie on the grass. Why not? I've often lied on the grass. Just think: when I was little, I wanted to be a teacher! Instead, look where am I: 20 km from Rome with a thief! If I get to live again, I'll take a nice bucket and go every day to the nuns for a dish of soup. But never again on the sidewalks! Rooms with beds only! The sidewalk is uncomfortable, eh? Come. Are you stupid? This place is full of nettles! What nettles? I eat nettles for breakfast! You'll eat them? Let's go. This way. Nicole', you must be healthy as a horse! What can hurt you? You'll live to a 100! - 100? Sure, with the work I do! What beautiful fine hair, just the way I like it. Show me your teeth.. - Damn it! Are you crazy? - Knock it off, cut the crap! What a bite. I'm leaving. Bye! - Let's go, come! I was joking, you didn't hurt me. What a beautiful day! And tomorrow'll be better still. I can see it in the sky. How quiet it is! The song of frogs.. Do you like fried frogs? Take it, it's almost gone. I could get you out of this life! - Yeah.. I swear by my father! Stop it, knock it off! You're getting in my blood.. You're different from the others. It's clear you weren't born to do what you're doing. Give me a kiss. Just one. Get lost! You still believe what they tell you? You bought it, eh? - I'm delusional! Every time they say it, I believe it. I'm such an idiot! Go jump in a lake! Good night! - Bye, Nicoletta! Shut up! What if someone had done that to your sister? - You're right. Hey, you're not going to do the same to me, are you? We'll know when I leave you. Who does he think he is? What are you thinking? - I don't know. I've been with you all day having fun. In a certain way, all that's happened is thanks to me. You made me jump through windows. At least, give me 10,000. You've got some nerve. Be grateful if we give you money for the bus! What! Money for the bus! I travel by taxi! Because of you, I couldn't even attend my aunt's funeral. Not even after death, did I show respect for that woman! Alright, you can go to your uncle's. What! Leave my family out of it! I'm not like you. I was raised properly. They gave me an education. Sure, they raised you like a flower. Look, if it was up to me, I would never had done what you did to those wretches. You want to go back and apologize? They'd beat me, they'd lynch me. Besides, if you're joking, do it right! You got 50,000 lire each? If you each give me 5,000, it won't break you. Of my 50,000 lire I can give you 1,000. Your 50,000? You're dreaming! - Speak Italian! I'm the one who took the risks. I'll give you 20,000 to be nice. - I have the money! They've stolen it! Have you seen the three women who were here with us? I watch cows not who walks by! If they're not here they'll be close by. We'll find them. They're not sitting on a roof! - And they walk by all day long. Do we three have to stick together? Look in some other place! Come on, relax! Are you sure you didn't see anybody? - I know nothing! Come, let's kick these cows! - I know nothing! Have you seen Anna and Supplizia? - No, they're not here at this time. Where can we find them? They're sleeping at some dive or station or church.. I don't know. Nina, these guys have a question! You know where Anna and Supplizia are? I'm here to work! I'm not an information booth! Don't get mad, it's just a favor. I'm out of favors and in this world only those who mind their business eat! Do you know where Supplizia is? - Who the heck is that? Look, that's nice! Beautiful car! - This is worth 100,000 lire! Let's grab it. - Watch out, there's people! Do you like it? - What? The car that's right behind you. - There's a car? Do you see it, Sparks? There's a camera in the back. It belongs to these gentlemen. What are you looking for? What were you doing? Nothing. - What were you thinking of doing with the car? Pee-pee. Beat it! The police! Stop it, there's the madame! The police! You wouldn't leave us here. would you? Get in the back. - OK! Hurry! We'll settle this later. - Fine, but let's take off! You're lucky, if the police hadn't come, we'd have given you a nice shave. Don't be so sure. Make no mistake, we're not letting you go yet. Listen, blackie, if you want a fight, pick somebody you can beat! We prefer the strong ones like you. Otherwise, there's no pleasure in it. - Then, you like to be beaten up? Up ahead there's a meadow where nobody will bother us, if you want to fight. I'll fight you, blackie! - If we don't hold him back, he'll go crazy. Well then? - The night is long, stay calm! Do we really want to beat them up? - If you're joking, do it right. Then, why are we here? - What did you eat today? A lion? I don't need to. I'll beat up all three, while you take off with the car. OK, but I think we might as well invite them to our weddings! Haven't you seen them? They look like corpses! Yeah, corpses. We'll probably know in ten minutes. Well, are you ready? Let's go, come! Wait a sec, what's that? Are you drunk? It's a bomber plane. - Long live the war! If it's from wartime, just think how much time has passed. Are they bringing it to the airport? You pull too! - I am pulling! Where'd you get it? - What's it to you? Is that how you answer? - From the hangar down there. They're discarded parts. Today two men were also taking some. What do you do with them? - We sell it to the junk dealer. Blackie, will you give us a hand? - Come on, let's get to work! What did I tell you? They're three saps! - Heavy, eh? What do you do with the money? - I give it to my mom. She's always asking for money. She'll only shut up if I bring her some. It's needed at home. There's a lot of mouths to feed. Who doesn't work doesn't eat! They'll give us a few lire for this. What else can we do? There's another piece but we couldn't carry it over. Right? -That one's a beautiful piece. Damn it! Will you lend me 1,000 lire? I'll pay you back tomorrow! Why not? I'll pay you for your troubles. Here. Nothing for my friends? A thousand each! Here. Happy? Thank you, blackie! Pull! Bye, blackie! See you! So, what about the fight? - We're ready. Why fight, boys? We can beat each other up when we're old! By now, it's water under the bridge! - OK. - I'm fine with that. I'm Achille. - A pleasure. Gino, known as Pretty Boy. Will you give us a lift? - With pleasure. Where shall we take you? - On an adventure! Bring us to life! Let's get to know the world! We don't have a lira, we're broke! If you shook us, you'd get about five lire. Where do we go? - Wherever! Public opinion is with us! Beat it! Beat it! Beat it! Beat it! Stop! - Get the plate number! Play the lottery with it! Hey, why did you beat them up? - I didn't like them! There's one of them! Hey, what's your price? - This one, you'll like! Do you like him? I'll buy you for him. - We can agree on that. Come here, love! Go bother someone else! Assholes! Look who we just bumped into! Don't let her escape! You're Nicoletta? - Yeah. - Recognize us? - Let me go! Give us the money or I'll kill you. - I've been here since this morning. If anyone is owed money it's me! Got it? We have to give you the rest? 100,000 lire isn't enough? What 100,000! - Let's get the money! I'm tired, leave me alone! Listen to me! If you don't take us to your friends, I'll break your legs. Thief, lowlife! I'll send you to prison! Taking advantage of me because I'm a woman! Those two bitches cheated me and left me at Fiumicino! Got it? Then they left poor little you without a lira. Worse off than us. Did you get to eat at least? Fine, if it's like that, then we'll do something for you. Right, kids? We'll give you a nice gift, a beautiful vase of flowers. What do you think, Achille? We need to leave a nice memory for this poor orphan. Get out of here! - Eat this! - Don't go, come here! Don't forget your aspirin! - Pigs! Goodbye, Nicoletta! In this plaza, where we meet.. - What are they giving out? Soup? Citizens, ease your brothers' suffering. With the gift of your blood, you can save a human life.. One, two, three, four, five and six. Shall we save 6 human lives? - Why not! Let's give these twats a slap in the face who are waiting in line! Come on! Let's go! Blessed be those who will take this blood! How much do they take? - A bath-tub each! What'd you think? Your name, please. - Ruggeretto, son of the NN. I want the money tonight. Nothing else matters. I know, that's why we're here. Everyone'll be sorry if we fail! Pepito! Enough of this boring shit! What do you want to hear? Pascalles de Albioni? Listen to this record. Puts you back in the world! Pigs! You got me drunk! I would never have expected this from you. Poor aunt, she's in a pit now! Here I am amusing myself like a bastard! I could spit in my face! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pretty Boy, knock it off! Hello? Is that you, Paola? Don't be stupid! Yes, Laura's here. Inside, in her bedroom. Come over. Boys. All boys. A big game hunt! A lion. A hyena. And a tiger. Who's there? Is Caterina there also? Even Harry? Good, come all of you. Hurry. People are coming. Can I say something? - Yes, what's the matter? I don't know how to say it.. you may not understand. I drink, laugh, act stupid. I don't even think about it. But I have poison in here. - Why? What did you do? Tell me about it. I don't know if you ever experienced it. A young girl, without a father or mother. I was a pig, but you know how it is. Now I feel bad. In short, the worst happened. No! - Yeah.. It's the truth. Was she nice at least? Worth your while? Hell no! Uglier than famine! But she was dear to me! And how could I leave her like that? With child? I even thought about working. Working? Me? A little more and I was done for. The other day I even pawned my gold chain that I wear around my neck. If my dad finds out.. Can you lend me some money? For the doctor. You're a friend. "Love," "my youthful emblem," "Back to gild.." "the earth again," "diffused amid the craggy day.." "Death, oblivious sister," "Your kiss will liken me to a dream." Is that you, Achille? Is it you? Yes. You're sure making yourself at home! What are you? A vision? Idiot! - Yes, call me an idiot. Give it to me. Give it to me, get my robe. You look better without it. Be nice, don't put it on, I want to see you again. Leave me alone. Shall I call my brother? - Who's that, Achille? You want me to call him? - No, I'll sit down and be good. Did Achille invite you? - Yes. Where did he pick you up? - In the street. We went on a binge. Without me! - Are you leaving? Why don't you stay? You see, I'm nice. Don't you enjoy making love? What's your name? - Ruggero, and you? Me.. Laura. Hey, kitties! Where you are hiding? My poor darlings.. Sweeties! So soft, so soft, so soft.. Want down? There we go. Go on. Go on! Go on! - Sweet cats. How cute! - You're lucky to have money! Must be nice to be rich! Who knows how many millions you have! At the minimum, you'll have two cars, or rather three. Four! Five, right? Listen, with regards to money.. I thought you were talking to me about love. Do you need a driver? - What? A driver? A driver! I'd better get dressed, because if the lady comes now there'll be screaming! She'll chase me away without a chance to explain myself! But tell me who you are! Who is this lady? Get lost! She'll lay into you too, if she sees that delinquent face of yours. Go! Let me through. - I don't like to be made fun of. Let go! - I want to know who you are. What's it to you? I'm a girl, right? Who are you then? You're not the maid.. What's it to you? Where were you? - I was here! - Beat it! What happened? - I stole a wallet! My heart is in my mouth. So? - How much? - Wait a sec.. Here it is. You see? A lot of bills. We didn't do too bad. That'll be 100,000 lire, 30 each. We're in this together, right? 30,000? If anybody's calling the shots on this one, it'll be me! I'll split it as I see fit. I'm the one who acted drunk. Then you arrive and you want 30,000? Are you sick? I think the whiskey made you sick. Don't put on that face, it doesn't scare me at all. The dough is mine and I'll do with it as I like. That remains to be seen. - One moment, I'm here too. You know what I think: let's return the money to the owner. You sure are crazy! Have you converted to Christianity? Listen, Pretty Boy, I'm not kidding! While you were drinking, I became acquainted with a girl. A knockout who'd make you dizzy. And now, for a few dirty lire, I have to give up that, you idiot? Take my advice and hand over the money. - You can't screw me over anymore. What is this? Romeo and Juliet? I'm all tears now, see ya! If you move, I'll slit you open! - Right, bye! Listen here.. I really liked that girl, and I want to see her again. The man isn't born who cheats on us! Right, Sparks? Hurry! Take me to Tor Pignattara! Stay here! Good evening, have you seen Rossana? She went out half an hour ago, all perfumed up! She went to the Golden Grape bar with Eliseo. He took her there for an ice cream. - Thanks. Goodbye. Hey, Sparks! Is it true about Rossana? - What do you mean? I've heard she saw him by the Tiber. And who she saw was very lucky! Good for him! - It's true, the cleanest is the one with scabies. With all the jealousy of her boyfriend, anyone looking at her is in for trouble! He wants her to wear a veil, so as not to attract flies and if you want to see her, you have to stick to the Tiber. What can one do? That's life! You're like the wolf: waiting for the pear to fall from the tree! Here comes Sparks. - Did they give him amnesty? He'll come asking for money to pay the taxi. Have you seen Eliseo with Rossana? - They dance well, so they went to dance. Who dressed you? The Sanitation Department? He had first communion in this suit, he'll get married and buried in it too! Tomorrow, I'll show up with a suit that'll make your jaws drop like this! Half-wits full of wisecracks, come inside and I'll get you something. What are you having? - Two bombs. Me too. - Four bombs. What do you want? - A cognac. You haven't eaten for two days, you want to die? A cognac.. and you? - Have you robbed a church? Are you paying with change? - Ever smell this type of perfume? From now on, you call me "Sir"! Please. Here slave, enjoy life! Here. You could lose it! Sparks, what are you doing? Have a drink with us! I'm inviting. Barman, three beers! What are you doing here alone? - I was hoping to run into some friends. You're having a good time? - Can't complain. What's Ruggero doing? Sleeping! Waiter, paid! - Have you gotten work? Me work? The others can work! Can I have a dance? - Go ahead! So you made money and now I don't see you no more! Excuse me, I know that you're with Eliseo! What am I going to do with you? Eliseo! Since when do you respect Eliseo? I know you inside and out. - You've been together a year. What do I care about Eliseo? You don't know what he's like. - Why? What does he do? He's jealous when it suits him. He thinks he's got me under his thumb, little does he know who I am! That's how it will be then: always at your service! Shall we leave? Where to? - To life! Rome is full of places. I'll make something up while you go and wait for me at my place. Tonight I really want to have a good time. What, are you afraid to die? Hit the pedal! Faster than this? Miss Fernanda! - Who is it? It's Sparks. - Come in. How are you doing? I'm waiting for Rossana. - Take a seat. Thank you. And your husband? How do you think it's going, my boy? Bad pains, punctured trachea. What does the doctor say? - That he'll have it for a year, and then.. What are you doing? Working? - A little. I'd like a good kid like you for my Rossanella! Instead she wastes time with that jailbird Eliseo! Where is Rossana? - She's coming. Have you given him a drink? - Right! You made me forget! Makes her happy seeing me like this. You'll be heading for the graveyard before me! Drink, to good health! - Your health. To yours! - Thank you. Look at these bums I have! Can't you say good evening to a guest? Well! No. - What are you doing then? - Now get back to bed! Did I scare you? Pretend I'm a piece of bread! You should hear this kid singing, he's a nightingale! Then, can we hear you sing? I'll give you 1000 lire to sing! Go on, sing. Are you ashamed to? Sing! - No. # Cerasella, Cerase', # When the lemons grew so free, with a slap you stopped me. # Cerasella, Cerase', # When the cherries grew so free, was when you kissed me, # Be it lemon, be it cherry, # Under the sun that gives warmth, sweet you'll always be.. - Hi. # If it's cold, you're a melon, # And the love in my heart freezes and lessens. # Cerasella, Cerase', # Go and tell her this song: the sour taste of a love too long, # my heart has become a lemon, # make it sweet again, hon. # Though nobody will know how much I love you, # If I don't sing with all my heart.. Where are my shoes? - In the window. # .. sighing away.. Very nice, here! Rossana! - One moment. Do you like it? - Yeah, I do. Let's go! Let's go. Good evening Fernanda, good evening Pietro. Have a good time. Surely, where we're going is where all the rich people go. Do I look good enough to go in those places? If only I had gold, a bracelet, a ring, a necklace.. I used to wear heaps of it. But that jerk, Eliseo made me pawn it! How you talk! - Because I'm happy. How nice it used to be. In your room.. half naked. Hey, stop it, Sparks! On the attack already? Take the first on the left. What do you want me to do, wait? - Count the stars, driver! But it's late.. Sparks, be nice! Come on, it'll be quick. Two kisses and we're done. Are we doing this like kids? - What's to stop us? Come on. Come on. Where are we going? On this? - Don't worry. I know this place well. I'll mess up my dress! I used to come here as a kid. I've fought many battles here! Come sit on the grass! Look how beautiful the moon is tonight! You like the moon? Are you afraid to die? Step on the pedal! Faster than this? Bye. - Thank you, eh? Have you seen Sparks? - Earlier. He had money! Where did he go? - To get Rossana. Could you lend me 2,000 lire? - For what! You don't trust me, eh? Shark, do you have 2,000 lire to lend this guy? All right. You'll get it back tomorrow! - Bye. Shall we take her to dance with us? Here. - Thanks. They must be looking for me. - Who? My friends. Goddamn the fright they gave me! Listen to that music! Come on! Excuse me one moment. - What is it? Would you please come.. - Why? What is it? - I'm sorry but the tables are all reserved. What about that one? - It is not possible. Bring another! - No. Why? Isn't my money good enough? Don't act like a bully. You've already been chased once from here. Don't force me to call the police. Don't make me do what I want to do: hurt all of you! Get your hands off! This time I have money! Isn't this money? Do you recognize it? If I wanted to I could buy this dump! Is my money not as good as the fossils who come here? Get him out of here! - Who would dare? Hands off me! I'll kill all of you! - Out! I'm calling the police! Get out! Get your hands off of me! - What's going on? Let go of me! - Stop it! - Two-bit servants! Scum! - Go on! Walk! - Get off of me! I know how to walk by myself! Take him away! You'll see me again! This is a public place, you can't kick me out! I'll make you sorry you were born! You'll all be sorry! Let's go, no more fuss. We know who you are! I'm a respectable guy, not like those inside. Assholes! Filth, you'll see how I'll get you for this! Scum! Cuckolds! Calm down, walk. Calm down, keep walking. You should take them away, not me! Who is this trash? Take him away! Up yours! - And your grandpa! That money is mine. - Why do you say that? Because I do. Give it. - No! - Give it here! Damned bastard! You should take them away, not me! And now, the money is in my pocket. There went the fun, eh? What will you do? Go home or stay with me? Well, I did go out to enjoy myself. What am I to do at home? - Then, come. And where are you taking me? - To life! Let's go! Come on! Hurry! Do you know you're beautiful? - Haven't you seen me before? Yes, but I haven't looked too closely. Waiter! Tip! - Thank you. Do you remember when your uncle got married? We were at the wedding breakfast, we were kids. We were 12 or 13 years old.. I had stolen sweets from you. But you were leaving. I wanted to give them back to you, but you said, "No, you eat them!" What? I don't remember. Ruggere', my head is spinning! I'm as drunk as a fish. - Let's get out of here! Let's get something to eat. Bill, please! - 3,500. Here. Keep the change. - Thank you. Let's go, the party continues. Anyone here? Have you gone bankrupt? Don't leave! Where are you taking me? - Don't worry. Come on, let's go in. Isn't anybody here? Good evening, how can I help you? - Can we eat here? It's a little late.. - So what, we'll eat even if it's late. Thank you.. This way. Where are we? At the graveyard? A place like this can't be found even in your dreams. Please, Miss. Please, Sir. Where's everybody? - You know, at this hour.. We came here for the music! What are you doing, packing up? We're entitled to a little rest, we're not animals! We'll see about that! Here's your share. Play it all! Dim the lights and light the candles! What would you like? Who is the richest customer ever to come here? There are several, the Aga Khan for example. Get us what he had. - As you wish. I'm offering you a meal as if it was the day of your marriage! Marry? With you for real? - Maybe you have to think about it? Crazy, that's too much! First grab me and then marry me? And where is the priest? - Then it's a no? No need to rush with the heart. Patience. Ruggero, you still haven't learned to know me as I am. Think of those who haven't eaten tonight! Feel this! I think I'm going to bust a gut! How vulgar you are, Ruggere'! You think they know we're just two poor people? - Why think about that? Give the waiters 5,000 lire and you're a prince! And you think those who have money are happy? You're right. After all, what are we really missing? We're young, healthy and able to have fun. One night out of a year is enough. Tomorrow, maybe we'll have to jump through hoops just to eat. Instead let's enjoy ourselves tonight, tomorrow the Lord provides for. Oh, yes! - And many times we will go hungry.. Are you cold? - A little. Stop right here! Wait a moment! I want to cover you with roses! Well, goodbye, Ruggere'. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Bye! Let me off a little further up, at the bridge. Here is fine. How much? - 10,000. Here, I got no more. - Good morning.
