Assunta, Concetta, what are you looking at? La fontana. We should be looking? Hold on to me. Come on, what a day, a ,muggy day. Santina, where are you going? To buy some aspirin. Come here. Come home, quickly. Assunta, run. Kidnappers. Mother. San Francesco. Not her, the "chiatta". Hold on to the pole. Hold on to the pole. Leave me alone, stop. No. Not Concetta. Run, Assunta. Tramps. Traitor, leave me. Take that. You got me. Coward, you've got my granddaughter Assunta. My daughter. Assuntina. "Mannagghia". I'm counting you all. I want to die. My mother. Who ordered you? Who ordered the car? That's not important. I'll throw myself.Better to be dead than dishonoured. Better dead. Let me jump. Stop resisting. What are you doing? You pushing? Please, go inside. Who's there? Walk. Who's this? Who are you? No, I wanted "chiatta". I told you it wasn't her. Stupid mistake. I'm not wrong, she is trying to confuse you. I didn't throw myself in the car. I thought you wanted to rape me. And what gave you the illusion that of all the people I would choose you? For many months we have looked at you from the window. You watched me, that's your business. I was watching you cousin Concetta. I don't want you either. I was holding onto the pole in the scuffle. That made me my cousin? Yes. She held onto the pole so tight she almost made it fall. She said "better dead than dishonoured". What he says doesn't matter. I'm the one who decides. But then why are we speaking so much? We would be losing time. - Exactly. We are losing time. At this point they have dishonoured me and you must marry me? Understand? Me? - Yes, you. If you want to live. - What? Vincenzino, we'll remove the disturbance. One moment, you do what? Come here and wait. Where are you going? - We're sorry but there's nothing to do now. You leave me here with this? Sorry but those are the facts. Have a glass of fresh water, it'll refresh you. This "disgrace" happens to me, still, it could be worse. Looking at you closely, you're not bad. Better than my Concetta? Well... What are you doing? What are you trying to say? First be a spouse, and then the rest. It's useless. You look at me with dead fish eyes. I'm an honest woman. It's useless doing that... I'm like a piece of marble. You kissing the dead. What was that? It was me, I dropped the knife. What do you feel? - A thing. - What thing? - I don't know. - Hold me. No. where are you taking me? Where are we going? No. No, not on the bed. I feel nothing, I'm like a piece of ice. Then, yes. Ruin me. My Vincenzo... All the nights I dreamt of you. All the nights. And when I looked at you from the shutters I thought "Who will be?" "Who will be the lucky woman who enters his life?" Assunta. Who taught you to kiss? I don't know. - Why? - I don't know. I've never kissed before. - Not true. - Not even my boyfriend. - Not possible. - Never. - But now... - You are lying. - They are yours. - I'll carry you with me to the tomb. - Oh my. I Can't breath. Vincenzo. Where are you? Have you seen a young man this high, with moustache, his name is Vincenzo? - Yes. He left this morning with a suitcase. - My daughter. - My daughter. You are dishonoured. - You do not want to marry any more. - You were a nun. - Now you must go to sea with a stone around your neck. It's the only thing to do to save the family's honour. Or you sisters will remain spinsters all their lives. - What was "it"? - I was ravished by force. But when it was happening I was as cold as marble. - There was no participation. - Cold or warm, how must I behave? You are my fiancée, take the knife and stab him. The males of your family must clear the offence. Then perhaps, I can marry you. We'll see. Salvatore, there are no men. There are only women in my family. You should think about it before you go to buy aspirin. I am against these methods. This is a gun. Passport for England. Address of the traitor. Photograph of the traitor. San Giovanni. May he place a hand on your head. 11,000 lira. No. Put them in your jacket. - This is the outward ticket. And the return? It's no good. Do the errand, then present yourself in police HQ. They will send you home with the guards for free. - "Bless your soul". - It'll be cold, wear your woollens. Find him, I urge you. Go now. Here I am. I'm waiting. - They're here. Maria Piaggi.- Speak any English? - Not even a little. Here I am. - I'm Karen. - We're going to an agency. I have machines. - Not bad. Giulietta couldn't come because she's getting married next week. Have you come in her place? - No, signora, I am already working. - £8 a week is acceptable? No thanks, I have grown fond of my work, I'm sorry. It's near Harrow Castle. We are alone, my husband and I... no children. Television. Salary: £8 . Free time for English lessons and dancing on Sundays. I don't dance. And I'm not a maid. Excuse me, who are you working for in Scotland? I have to run an errand and then leave straight away. Excuse me. Maybe if you change your mind...This is my address. I told you I have to do an errand and leave. Take it anyway. You never know. Maccaluso Vincenzo... works here? But I was given this address. Who are you? A relative. Wait a moment. Vincenzo - What do you want? There's someone outside for you. I understand, an Irish. No, a Sicilian with black hair. - Where's my jacket? - What happened? See you, bye to all. - Who is it? - A big whore. He's gone on holiday. - He still works here. - Yes, I just said he's on holiday. When's he back? Two, three weeks... Do you know where he lives? I must find him. Absolutely. I must leave again quickly. But where are you going to find him? I don't know where he is. - It's best you take the train and go home. I cannot go home. I can't return there. I have to stay ten years, I have to find him. Understand? Why are you telling me? - Who else can I tell? I don't know anyone else here. Listen... tonight, if you want, you can sleep with me. Today and Saturday, tomorrow and ... I'll give you the key? Later, when I return... What did I say? Is this lady far away? Is Mrs McIntosh here? I am the maid. A service. Always had" "Italian maids". "Italian" maids. The lady... where is she? "Wife". Where? Back soon. - So, you and I, at home... we are alone. ... alone. Alone. "You and me... in house". - In house. Alone. I'll wait here. "To wait". I not at home alone with a man again. Never again. - Not returned yet. - What did you say? - They don't know anything? - They don't know a thing. Sooner or later they'll need to return. How are you getting along with your mistress? I can't complain. But I don't like the braid. There's a man dressed as a woman. It's a kilt, Busy. It's a national costume. For me? Secure? - Now? - It's Vincenzo. Why did you follow me? You made me lose my job. Because you left me? Fast. Why did you leave? I made a sad discovery that night. Explain more. Your behaviour was not that of an honest woman. Where did you learn to kiss? I told you I'd never kissed before. It was my great love for you that taught me. You learnt too quickly. I thought you were an honest woman... I had to resist. The great love made me a dishonest woman. And how can I be sure you haven't told the same to anyone else? You see, the answer didn't come to you straight away. I didn't answer straight away... ..for the great emotion to hear your beautiful voice. Vincenzo, you made me a woman... ..and you are mine for life. You were the first. Understand? The first. The only one. Your mine and no one else's. Clear? And if I don't agree? I'll put a bullet in between your eyes that goes through your head. Go home, whore. You won't find me, get it? You won't find me. My love, I'm free Sundays... ... and for you, every Sunday will sound the bells of a dead man. You can kill me. I don't marry whores like you. Whore. He's not speaking anymore. Where? What? Another city? Far? It's about 350 miles. What are you going to do? You Italian? Italian shoes Sicilian. So, why are you speaking Italian? I'm taking a course in Italian. I travel a lot. What's your name? - Patane Assunta. Why? - What are you doing in Sheffield, Assunta? Maccaluso Vincenzo. I hope. You know my boyfriend? Where am I? Countryside. - Let go. - I know all the places where the Italians dance. - Get lost. - Come on. - Scoundrel. Madman. Let go of the suitcase. Is the devil inside there? Personal belongings. What's he called? We'll go ask that girl outside. Why do you dance like "steel"? Hard. Would you believe it? I'm not used to dancing with a man. What can I do for you? One piece of information. - She wants to know if you know a man and his address. - What's his name? You know Maccaluso Vincenzo? He's hard to resist. I don't know if I can remember. .. ...When he wasn't flat out in my place. - On the sofa of course. - What?. Are you sure it's only the sofa? - Don't ask these things. Those are her affairs. - Personal stuff?. He wanted to get married right away, but I didn't. But how? If one of you sleeps on the sofa... ..the he wants to put it right and you refuse? - What is this woman? "Whore". - You can't say that. But now Vincenzo... where is he? You know...where he goes to be alone? - Where? - The "coffee bar". It's late. Closed. Tomorrow. Watch that one. - Who, the wasp? - Teach him a lesson. Please, punish him. - But what did he do? - Touched me, like this. And insulted me. - No "compliment", insult. - "To me and you ". "If Vincenzo were here"... and he saw, he'd take a knife and attack him. Vincenzo is a man. A real man. Where you going? My house. Over there. The black one, in the 3rd row. They're all black. Who's inside? Nobody? There was my sister. But she left and got married. I won't be alone in a house with a man. - A "little hotel", very near. - Me in "the little hotel"?. And me in the black house. In my house there are 2 rooms: One for me and one for you. If you want to sleep with me, I'd be very happy. If not, I won't touch. - What sort of a man are you? - I don't understand. - 2 hours. I play Saturday. I want to see. But how? You man, I woman. No one in the house and you look at the TV? Let go. How do you allow yourself? Holy Mary. The gun. I'll kill you. Watch yourself or you get this in the eye. Don't understand, you provoked me. The true man must show, and the true woman must defend. Away. What? You locked it? - The girl knows him. - Even she's a whore. I wait. This way I can't see the door. Now I go to work. I hope that you find your boyfriend, I wish you good luck. You've been very nice. Still here? Didn't come? How does this Vincenzo Maccaluso appeal to you so much? Everyone has they're reasons. What are you going tonight? I'm going to play rugby in another city. - I've got a long trip now so I must sleep. - What will I do? I can come with, where are you going? It's a long way. Sleep? I had 11 coffees while waiting. That man deserves a stab. Shameless. Why don't you kill him? Where's it going? To Barts, the hospital. - What? - Vincenzo Maccaluso. - "Macca" who? This hospital is not for infectious diseases. Wait here. Stay on the line. Where are you going? Where are you going? Go with the second dose. How much? 115. Here's the syringe. Pulse? Normal. Scalpel. - Sister. - Retractors. Take her away. There are seven hospitals, who knows how many Italians are working there. For information on Italians... ..you'll have to ask Dr Hopkins' wife. - Why? - She's the lady to ask if you're looking for an Italian. But when searching for a maid, one asks a woman. No, this woman is not looking for a maid. And who is she? What happened? Veins. When someone cuts their veins, their blood group is always in their pocket. Take him please. Want to earn a pound? - What group are you? - Group Sicilian. - No, what blood group. We hope you're both B. - Let's hope. He looks dead. He slit his wrists. They never die in these cases I say he looks dead. If he does, do they still pay me? There's Professor Osbourne. He's angry with you because you entered the operating room. He's been lucky professor. She's the same group. Never had diseases? What? - Your parents still alive? My father is dead. How did he die? - Shotgun. What? - Shotgun. - I think I understand. Listen here, why are you carrying this? - For my boyfriend. - I don't understand. - I understand. - Good. But for now, it's with me. You'll get it back when you leave. Doctor. My pay? - Naturally. - You'd do anything for the sick, professor? No, I think you're better than me. And her, who needs help. And so, she cheated only once? No, no. Maybe with another. With many others. With many?. Often? Yes, even with the butcher. Still, with everyone. So why haven't you stabbed her? - I took a knife. - But you have to kill her, not yourself. You're a very strong woman. But we're not all the same. But you're a man. Are you missing something in your head? But, when I find Vincenzo,... ..you'll see a light and the end of a traitor. Holy Mary, she's come up here. This is my bad luck and my ruin. I'm going to see death. How do I get rid of her? How? - Who's at the front? - Reginaldo, a friend. - Reginaldo? I know him. Vincenzo, the Sicilian. Is he here? Why no? Before you said you knew him. - Yes, but he's not here. - But he works here. - Then where? Don't know. Probably in some other hospital. Please. Next. I have an appointment with doctor Cole. We must return here. This is two days we've been going round hospitals. It's not funny, you know? But I will have given you half a litre of blood. And you have to accompany me. You're Assunta Patane? - And who are you? - Corregionali. You have the right to say if we're bothering you,... ...but this is a matter of bad luck. Bad luck? - For whom? - For a person you've wanted a lot. Why do you say that? He passed away. - Who are they? - Cosa nostra. You don't say? But how is it possible? I saw him ten days ago. Untimely death? He jumped into the sea to save a woman. There and then he was well. But then... maybe a shot of cold. And so, with this northern climate, he got pneumonia... And where is he lain? You want to see the body? Then it's true. Vincenzo. My Vincenzo. The only point of my life. Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me? You are dead. - And me? I remain dishonoured. Her boyfriend. I had to kill you. Me, with my own hands. - She tried a lot, and now I think she despairs. - Now what do I do? Who will give me my honour back? I bare all. I bare all. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to jump overboard. In the sea. In the sea. These are personal effects of the deceased. We were told to deliver them to you. There's £26, a collection from Italian colleagues,... ..with which you can buy a return to distant and beautiful Italy. And that means I can return home, if he dies a natural death? What will I say to people? I you will permit me, I will advise you. On arrival, you will be presented the marshal of the Police... ..and say: "I killed him". You'll do two or three years in prison, maximum... for the offence, and your honour will be regained. I need to say something. Don't go away. But I must. Since I have known you, I have dreamt strange things. It's because I like you. Assunta, you are so strong, so full of fire. What are you saying? I am a woman. Idiot. I am... a woman. Not true, I think that... you're the woman that does it for me. - Please, stay. - But what will I do here? If you want, if you don't have anything against it, marry me. Right now. How I need someone like you. Regular marriage? - See what a mess you've made. - But this is my house. You're house?. But then, you're rich. Blessed virgin, the bedroom. Traitor. You're all the same. Right away, right in the bedroom? Do you only have one thing on your mind? Like the miner with his lamp. What's the matter? What's the matter?. If you want to take me, you'll have to do it by force. Come, come closer. come closer. I didn't hear you arrive. I hope you can stay for the weekend. Sure. I want to introduce a guest an Italian girl, Assunta. Assunta, my mother. Mamma, we want to get married. Tonight you will sleep in the yellow room. Tea will be ready in five minutes. How are you? Hi. You're back from Sicily? No, I never left. I stayed for a week, and then I got married. - But I was told your boyfriend died. - Yes, he did. But I am marrying another man. Called Frank. Frank, come here. Have you met? This is the professor. Come. Do you remember, professor? That's right. You're madly in love. - Exactly. The day I was going to leave, he asked me to marry him. - Marry?. - He asked me with so much passion, I was almost kidnapped. - Please, Assunta. - But it's true. He's a bit shy. Indeed, I understand. Congratulations to both of you. Sorry, I don't know anyone else here at Barts. You could kindly be a witness? - I don't know if I'm free. What day is it? - Don't worry. How's this, you tell me when you're free, and that will be the day. Sure, but you can't do that with my job. It's a bad job like that. - Say if you don't want to. - Why? It's possible. - Fix the day and let me know in hospital. Is this Monday good for you? - Why marry that boy? - I'm in love. And he asked in such a way. - Tell me one thing, have you already slept with Frank? Actually... he's never tried. Does that seem normal? Well... no it's not normal... ..to marry a woman that's already been with another man. Tell me, have you ever seen the... person over which he attempted suicide? He's never spoken about it. You know something? Well, I know who it is. And I know where... this person hangs out. Over there, that's the person. Him. In velvet, with lace. Queer? - I don't know the word, but I think that's it. I'm sorry, but as a doctor and a witness, I had to warn you. That's right? We joked. I can see my fate is to end up in Sicily as a criminal. Buried deep inside the house,... ..with my sisters, who, sadly, have nothing. One moment, I have an idea. I don't understand this story,... ..but if it's so painful, why not stay here, even if you are alone? You can find a job, and improve your English,... ..then, you'll be independent and won't need to go home, no? Then, I can help? Why not try? Quit with the blowing? It's 2am. We want to sleep? You want to become a teacher? We can try to implement it. But we can't say if the operation is safe or not... ..in in any case where the pressure falls below a certain limit. Don't deceive the professor. He's married. And to a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I saw her yesterday. She's elegant with short red hair and in really good shape. The professor is like a father to me. Bunny eyes. Do you understand? I really wish you well, you know?. You are the one I love. I'll be your groom. You are beautiful. I want you so much. I'm 'Ave Maria", and this is your last hour. Your dead. Professor Osbourne. Come, it's urgent. But... it's Mrs Hopkins. But how has this happened? Professor, Dr Hopkins' wife. Her husband shot her. - Stop. Pressure gauge. - Perhaps she wanted to commit suicide. - But she was shot in the legs. What's all this fuss? - She's dead? - Who are you? Get out. - Where is my husband? That woman is mad. She wants to ruin me. She wants to kill me. - Who? - Tom, please, let's say she fell, I dunno, a fracture... Easy, calm youself. I want to get this clear. Have the police been informed? - Yes, she... - Will you shut up?. Who? - I don't know. I know. She's a madwoman. From Italy who's trying to kill me. - She's mad. She has a gun, and she means business. - And where is she now? She went to the police to give herself up. Please, doctor... Sort her out. Free me from the insane one. Doctor, please. I'll stay here, eh? I don't know, I know nothing. - Come on, come with me. - I killed Maccaluso Vincenzo. - The errand is done. - Shh. - I killed the double-crosser. - Now I confess and I... - Now come with me. - I can't. First I must confess. - Do as I tell you. Let's go. - Get out. - Why? - Come on, don't make a fuss. Is there a train to Rome? There's a plane to London in fifteen minutes. The next is in an hour. - I'll take it. - For two? - No, one one-way. My credit card. - What name? - Assunta Patane. P-A-T-A-N-E, with an accent on the E. Quick, give it here. - I won't leave. - Get on now, you're not worthy to live among civil people. I'm afraid of flying. You have no fear of shooting someone, but you're afraid of flying. Come on, move. I didn't want to shoot him, but I when I saw him... ..the red mist fell and I couldn't see anymore. You need to learn to master you instincts better than a wild animal. I have blood in my veins, not like him who doesn't love anybody. Ah, well if you love somebody, shoot. You're talking nonsense. No, you shot at an innocent. - Innocent?. Who's innocent? He's a traitor. - Cretin. - You hit her, not him. - Her? Missed... the aim? A whore nonetheless. But... I can't go back. I want to stay here... with him. We'll stay right here. You'll live well in a cave. But... what will I say to the village? You'll say you had terrible luck. That you shot Vincenzo... Macca, whatever he's called, and you missed. And that you found it embarrassing to report it to the police,... ..so you flew directly back to Rome. Try it again and you won't be so lucky,... ..so hold a go home and thank me. - And now you can go. - Are you angry with me? Very. I regret that I'm helping you to escape. Don't be angry. I promise to do exactly what you told me. And if someone finds fault, I will cry and stab myself in the heart. Good. Were getting better. Your right. I swear, I'll end it with a knife. I want to do ... whatever pleases you. Run. Use your brain. Mother, I missed. I missed the target. - You returned, shameless. - I missed. You are a Whore and a slut. You've dishonoured the family. We'll be landing in London in five minutes. What are you doing in London? - What are you doing for peace? - No more violence. You told me to. I've been thinking a little. You're different. The hair... And you've also changed. You've lost weight. - You look tired. - I've been working a lot. You don't work at Barts anymore? My wife and I have decided to divorce and I have moved here. I'm sorry. I thought you got on well with your wife. And very beautiful. Yes, very beautiful. And I loved her very much. And for this I get a gift: divorce. Thursday's ruling in court. But tell me about you instead. Let me see. Look, over there. Look. - What am I looking at? - Look at the bottom. It's me. So then you didn't go back to Sicily. How did you cope with it? It was hard at first, but now it's much better. I work in publicity photography here. It's kind of a restaurant. They give me something to eat and I get two guests a week. We're two. Is there a table? - Behind you. Strange place. - So you... work inside here? - Indeed. Wait a minute. - This is the signed document. - Can I keep it? - Yes, if you like. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. I was passing by chance and I thought, 'I've never seen a divorce'. Strange story. Let me present my wife. My ex-wife that is. - No, I don't want to meet her. - Why not? She's not bad at all. - Because I don't want to. - Tom, Michael says do you want have a drink with us. I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself. I have a great desire to go to the zoo. May I introduce Assunta. Pleasure. Tom has told me a lot about you. I had a little desire to see what he was talking about. Come with us to the zoo. Tom and I used to go there often. It's a very nice place. I don't like the zoo. Sorry. Wait. Why not come? If I go I will stab her. Come on, be rational. She's done nothing wrong. If it's anyone's fault it's mine. Do you understand? You never understood why I wanted to kill Vincenzo... ..and I will never understand why you would want to go to the zoo... ..with your ex-wife, her boyfriend and me. Has he called? Yes, he called a while ago. - And what did he say? - I can't remember. - Don't move. - It's from home. - I'm coming. - Here's your beer. - Hello, I'm here. - It's Vincenzo. - What?. - I have moved to London and I must see you. - Come on, hurry. - We need to talk about things. I've opened a small Italian shoe shop and things are going well. And well, I wanted to check... ..whether it was you I've seen on all the posters. - Ah, there. - If he asks tell him I'm not here. It's exciting. Hello, Assunta? It's Vincenzo. No. It's not her. Where would she be? - "I don't so". - But who are you? - A friend. - Very well. No, professor Osbourne and party left yesterday for Jersey. He's on leave. Is it urgent? Jersey? No, it's not far but you'll have to take a boat. Can I get a boat? - Not with that sea? - None are leaving? - No. We hope tomorrow morning if all goes well. - Is there a hotel? - Yes. In Brighton there are always open hotels. You asked for Jersey? I hoped that you would call. Why don't you come here? I wanted to, but the boat isn't leaving until tomorrow morning. - I like to be there. Feeling lonely? - A little. But I'm going to bed now. - Is something wrong? - I don't know. I think so. I've had a little headache. Go to the pharmacy and buy a tube of Ospris. Take two tablets. - And go to bed soon. - Yes, like a light. - Come soon. How are you? Good, thanks. And you? Not bad. What are you doing here? I was going to take the boat but it didn't leave. And you? Just passing. Coincidence, no? Indeed. You don't want to kill me anymore? - Why? - Because. - You found a better way. However, I am happy to have seen you. If you'd allow me to accompany you. I have nothing to do. You are so elegant now. I hardly recognise you. You too look well. You don't seem at all the same. Yes, I can't complain. I've had some success. - Can I make you some coffee? - No, thanks. Coffee gets me agitated. I can now afford to return to the country and open a bar. Beautiful, and I want to open it right in the square But... you, then... you married? Do I seem the type to marry a English girl? I once lived with a girl for two months. As husband and wife. Concubine. She wanted me, but sometimes she said "Tonight, I go out with friends". I said "But if you love me so much, why do you go out with your friends?" You know what she said? "Friendship is as important as love.". Well. What can you do? I said "You must choose, me or your friends". What did she do? She chose her friends. What did you want from her? What do you look for? Assunta... I want a woman who is mine. To think all this success because of that nonsense... ..when we spent a night together. Why call it nonsense? - I'm just saying it was without importance. - No, Assunta. Unimportant, perhaps for the people of this country. But not for me. What are you saying? What I mean is that according to our sacred principles,... I still have some claim over you, because of that night. I don't understand what you mean. Assunta, you are like me, Sicilian. And you understand very well what I mean. It's useless to look at me like that. I have changed profoundly. Want to dance? Assunta, you remember, the village,... ..with men dancing on the terrace I held Carmelo... but I thought about you. And I danced with my cousin... but I thought... .."Vincenzo, hold me.". - why re you laughing, Assunta? It's the emotion. It's the first time the two of us have danced together. The first time. - It's best we say goodbye here. - No, wait. No, watch it. Allow me some more time? I want to talk. Stop Assunta, don't shoot. Marry me. It's empty. I only hold it for memory. You do not need the gun anymore, because of what I realised... - Yes? -...That my life without you doesn't matter. - But you know that I'm as cold as marble. - Then why did you drop the gun? - Marry me. - But you have lied to me once already. - I give you my word, Assunta. - Then... yes.... - But, we must return to Sicily. - Eh? - But to Catania. - Wherever you want. - In Catania no one knows your life, sins. In Catania nobody knows. - It's a secret we'll take to the grave. - To the grave, whatever you want. You must promise me one thing: to forget the past. I don't remember anymore. And another thing. You must waiver your freedom forever. What do I want my freedom for? I want to be chained to you forever. As you like. Where are you going? Wretch. Assunta, what are you doing? Wretch. A whore to start with... and a whore you remain.
