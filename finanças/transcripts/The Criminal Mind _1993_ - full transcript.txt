[soft piano music] [tense piano music] [soft piano music] [windshield wipers scraping softly] [soft piano music] [tense piano music] [rifle clicks] [tense piano music] [gunshot blasting] [tires skidding] [tires screeching] [motor humming] [grass crunching] [shoe thudding] [Nick groans softly] [Nick gasps] [radio clicks] - This is 40 Victor-One. Patch me through to Crime Watch, over. [radio buzzes] - [Man] This is Crime Watch. Go ahead, 40 Victor-One. - I think I found your man. - [Crime Watch] You sure? - Yes, sir. I got me a major most wanted here. Only he don't look much like a dangerous killer, presently. [door creaking] [door thudding] [stack thudding] [envelope thudding] - All right. Would you mind putting that crap back in the bag? It's still evidence. By the way, whose ring is that? [pad thuds] [Winslow sighs] - You think we can get through this today? - You got a date? Your name is Nicholas Isidore Augustine, AKA Nicholas August? - Yeah. - And you waived the right to have an attorney present. Is that correct? - My attorney is present. - Let's get to it. I'm Special Agent Winslow of the FBI, Organized Crime Division. I'm confused about one thing, your residence. Are you are living in Los Angeles or Palm Springs? - You seem to have all the information today. Why don't you tell me? - You know something? I'm sure that that wit got you by in Baker and Colgate and Virginia Law, but it just doesn't cut it down here. You know what I mean? Let's not go down that path. And if you're so goddamn smart, what are you doing in here? Look, before we get started, you want like a soda? Coffee? Here, look, have a cigarette. [pack thuds] Relax. [Nick sighs] - Yeah, that's how I used to do it, too. - Excuse me? - Look, let's just cut the bullshit, okay? You know who you're talking to. See, the first thing I used to do is get the relationship going, establish some contact. Care for a cigarette? [Agent Winslow sighs] [lighter clicks] [Nick laughs] Oh, here we go, baby! [men laughing] [ball bouncing] Hehe, got you there! [laughs] [ball bouncing] Ho, coming in to me! [ball bouncing] [Anson grunting] [Nick chuckles] - Nice serve. So, when were you gonna tell me, pal? - Tell you what? - That you're getting kicked upstairs. - I'm not going anywhere. Serve the ball, let's go. - Deputy Attorney General's office ordered a job eval on you, buddy. I smell justice. [ball bouncing] [floor squeaking] Yep. Lousy back hand. - I'm trying to concentrate here, do you mind? Thank you. - There's rumblings going around that Federal's putting together a new team of hot shots to work in organized crimes. - Who told you that? - Serve. [ball bouncing] I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty jealous. They must want you pretty bad, too. Your background check alone was this thick. - What's the score? - Nine all. [ball bouncing] [Anson shouts] My serve. [laughs] [Anson sighs] Organized crimes has been monitoring a new undercurrent of hostility in the mob of late. - I thought the families went legit years ago. - Well, they have and they haven't. I mean, one thing's for certain, the mafia certainly has assimilated into society. Hell, you can't buy a glass of beer or a gallon of gas without the mafia getting a kickback somewhere down the line. - So, why are they still warring with each other then? - They're not. Somebody from the outside is coming at them. - Who? - Well, who do you think? The guys that picked up what the mob left behind. The next generation of immigrants? The Chinese? I mean, the Triads are all fleeing Hong Kong. I guess they figure it's easier to come over here and take on our criminal justice system. - Yeah, well, I don't see it. - Yeah, but these are smart guys. I mean, they kept chipping away, chipping away until they found somebody that could open up the back door. Somebody who will let 'em in, make some introductions. They settled on this mid-level hood from Jersey who just got relocated out West. Guy got a little too ambitious for his own good. You know, the Triads are wining and dining the hell out of him. He's gonna be their entree into the power base, setting him up with his own little organization. Organized Crimes calls him the Toy Godfather. He's got like his own little empire already. I don't know, maybe you've heard of this guy. Carlo Augustine. [soft piano music] Nick, you okay? You all right, man? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Anyway, this guy came up through the ranks. He has some lineage. His father was Armando Augustine. I mean, to the mafia families, this guy was il capo di tutti capi. The godfather. He was a tough old bastard too. I think it was back in the '60s when one of his paisans took him out. The hit wiped out the whole family except for the two kids. Two sons. Carlo was the oldest. Now the Triads are setting him up out here, out West, down out of Palm Springs. - What happened to the other boy? - Oh yeah, well, he was just a little kid at the time. Nobody really knows what happened to him. [soft piano music] [gunshot blasting] [soft piano music] [gunshot blasting] [gunshot blasting] [soft piano music] [rifle clicking] [gunshots blasting] [body thudding] [soft piano music] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] - [Nick Recording] Hi, leave a message and have yourself a good day. [answering machine beeps] - [Anson] Nick, it's Anson. Come on, bud, I know you're there. Pick up or I'm sending a squad car. All right, I'm giving you a three-count. One, two. - Hi, Mom. - [Anson] You okay, bub? - I'm fine. I guess I just must be a little burnt out. - [Anson] Can't handle the pressure, huh? I always knew you were soft. My top boy goes AWOL, I'm going berserk around here. Seriously though, I was getting a little worried. - Hey, I'm sorry about that, Ans, I really am. - [Anson] Look, you want some R & R, you got it, bub. God knows you put in more time than any five of my DAs. You got enough sick time and vacation leave coming to cruise for a while. - Great, that sounds good, thanks. - [Anson] Anyway. It's good to know you're all right, buddy. - Okay, you take care now. Something was stirring inside me, it was like pulling me back. I felt like I was going crazy. - You saying that your strange behavior was caused by some kind of schizophrenia episode? - You've got to understand something. I'm going along, see, living the life. Doing the job, thinking I'm this guy. And one day I found out I'm not me. I'm somebody else. Somebody born out of a nightmare. - So, your conversation with Waverley at the racquetball court, that's what prompted you to go to Palm Springs? - Something was eating at me inside. If Carlo was out there, then I had to find him. A buddy of mine at the Palm Springs DA office gave me the name of the restaurant the local wise guys hung out. I wasn't the only one staking out the joint. [camera clicks] - What were you expecting to find? [soft piano music] [camera clicks] [soft piano music] [car motor hums] [soft piano music] [birds chirping] [soft piano music] [gun clicks] [gate hums] [car motor hums] [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [alarm beeping softly] [men grunting] [legs thudding] [Nick groaning] - Nicholas. Is this the ganef you say was following us? Oh God, get, get. Nicholas, come, come, come, shh, shh, shh. Come, sit down. Why are you here? - That's what I'd like to know, Manny. You tell me. And what's an East Coast attorney doing with the syndicate in Palm Springs? - Oh, they're clients. You lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. I count you with your-- - No, no. This is not legal. - Legal? What's the difference? We're lawyers. We deal in the business of interpretations. That's not why you're here, is it, my son? - No. - [sighs] I have always dreaded that this day would come. And now you shall have that you seek. Nicholas, this is your brother, Carlo. - Hiya, little brother. [soft piano music] [hand patting] [hand patting] Yeah. [Carlo chuckling] [hand patting] Little Nicky here comes running across the yard, dropping his diapers. He runs buck naked up to Papa. Papa picks him up. You remember how burly Papa was? - [Manny] Yeah. - So, he picks Nicky up, holds him up like this, you know? All of a sudden, Nicky lets go. Squirts the old man right in the face! [men laughing] Pissed right in his eye. [men laughing] He always called you squirt after that. [laughs] - Carlo. What was Papa like? - You don't remember? - No, I mean, I was just a kid. - He had a big laugh. You could hear him bellow anywhere in the house. But he had a temper. Like a good Italian son, I guarded myself whenever I walked by him. I never knew if he was gonna hug me or cuff me. He liked to hit. Yeah, but you, you got off easy. He mellowed a lot with you. For the first six months after you were born, I don't think he put you down once. He was always walking around with you in his arms. [coughs] Course that changed some after you peed on him. [men laughing] Gabrielle, sweetheart. You're up. Hey, come on over here, I want you to meet somebody. Gabrielle, Kiki, this is my kid brother, Nicky. - It's very nice to meet you. - Carlo, I thought we were gonna go out tonight. - Hey, not tonight, babe. Come on, it ain't every day you hook back up with your kid brother. - Carlo, I'm bored, and you said we were gonna go out. And you said it'd be tonight. - We ain't gonna. So cool your jets. - Well, Kiki and I can go out, and you can just ask Silvio to bring the car around. - Yeah, who do you think you are, her father? - Will you tell her to shut up? You ain't going nowhere. - We're going out. - No, I said, now sit down. - Come on, Carlo. Don't be such a hard ass. - What's your problem? I bring you out here, you can do whatever you broads want. Lay out by the pool, tan your tits, go shopping, whatever. All I ask is you look good when you're hanging on my arm, be a good screw and show a little respect! I said sit, you sit. Sit! You fuckin' want some of this, I'll fuckin' give you some of this! - Carlo, take it easy, okay. You don't have to get so rough with her. - Hey, hey, college boy. You may be the big dick in LA, but in this house, I'm pezzonovante. I call the shots. - Hey, tough guy. This is family? - Hey, I don't want no grief from you! I'll tell you when I want to hear from you. Otherwise you stay shut! - Well, some gangster, terrorize an old man. [suspenseful music] [belt smacking] - Yeah. Hey, you're lucky, you know that? You don't have to live with Papa's temper when you're like me, you know? It comes quick, like lightning. [grunts] Hey, come on. I'm just letting off a little steam here, you know what I mean? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, how come you're so different than me? I look at you, I see Mama's face. But your different. - Nicholas is a good boy, this kid. - Hey, you hungry, baby? - You know, Manny promised we'd go to Vegas. And there's a volcano in the swimming pool. And I just love getting it on with clowns in circus circles. - [laughs] You got to just love her. [wine splashing] - You know, this reminds me of the time I was working with Jimmy the Fin, you remember him? What am I saying, you was just a little dink. So Jimmy, he had these jealous streaks. He, especially when he came to his old lady, boom. He was convinced she was doing half the neighborhood. So, one day he follows her. He finds her in bed with another guy-- - [Nick Voiceover] I realized that Carlo was like every bad guy I had ever prosecuted. And deep inside, I had a problem with that. Over the next few days, he gave me an insider's look at the criminal world, and it was mesmerizing. - Well, you see a lot of guys who make their bones probably already hit a couple three guys before they get made. It's kind of like them fighter pilots making ace, see. They gotta be confirmed hits or it don't count. - How many guys you gotta kill to make your bones? - Well, only one, but you don't get made till somebody says you did it. It was kinda like me. I whacked maybe three, four guys coming up. The man who says I'd made turns out to be, you ready for this? Sammy G. - Sammy G. - You ever heard of him? - Wasn't he some big time hood out of Jersey? - No, he was more than that. Sammy G was the son of a bitch that whacked Papa. - Are you sure? - Of course. Of course, I'm sure. Beautiful, ain't it? I ended up going to work for the prick, 10 years. - You worked for the guy who killed Papa? - Hey look, pal. Sooner or later, everybody works with everybody. Hey Manny, Manny, Manny. [chuckles] So kid, tell me what was it like having your little pink butt pampered by this old man? - Old? [chuckles] I'll dance on your grave. - [laughs] I couldn't wait to get out of college, right? Then after law school, all I wanted to do was go back in. - Yeah. Hey, tell me. You stick it to a lot of college pussy in the back of a convertible? - I didn't let him have a convertible. It's too dangerous. And you can't get warm in winter. Who needs the headache? No, for Nicholas, a sedan. - A sedan? Manny gave you a sedan? - A Buick. - Nicholas is a good boy. He got good grades, he earned it. - So, he gets a car, goes to college, and I grow up living on the streets. And why is that? I'll tell you. See, you were a cute little baby. Everybody loves cute little babies, you know what I mean? They're like puppies. Me, I had no where to go. Manny wouldn't take me in like he did you. - You were a punk. - Yeah, punk. I was too old for ya. My family gets wiped out. Because I'm too old, you wouldn't give me shit. And now you're working for me, how do you like that? [chuckles] Yeah, that's right, pal. You know something? For me, the best. The best food, best broads, best lawyers and Manny here. [lips smacking] He's the best. Hey, kid, you play it, right, who knows? Maybe you come work for me too. Never hurts to have a DA in your pocket. [laughs] Yeah? [laughs] - [Nick Voiceover] But then I would get a reality check. Carlo had a way of doing that. - I'm sick and tired of being stuck in this house. Day in, day out. [suspenseful music] Christ, Carlo, you don't fucking pay attention to me. All you do is talk to your stupid brother. You want everybody to think you're such a big man and you're nothing. You are fucking nothing, and you know that I know it. - [Carlo] You're asking for it. Now you want it? You want some Goddamn attention, bitch! Well, you got it! - No! [belt slaps] - Okay? - No! [belt slaps] - You had enough, have ya? You had enough? - No! - Carlo, what the hell you doing? - Stay out of it! - Get the fuck outta here! [shoe smacks] [suspenseful music] [belt thuds] - Carlo Augustine, what a sweetheart. This guy's in juvenile hall until he's 18, and he walks with a clean record. 28 arrests, including numbers, drugs, racketeering, prostitution, assault, laundering. You name it, this guy's done it. Murder, and implicated on five others with no convictions. Why? Because he's got a good lawyer. Like you. Manny Kohen. [crickets chirping] - So, pal, tell me. What are you thinking about doing in LA? You gonna be like a judge or what? - I don't know. I was thinking about going up to the federal level. - Really? - Yeah. Maybe even the Attorney General's office. - I bet you got a lot of good stuff you could use against me, huh? - It's privileged. I couldn't testify against you even if I wanted to. But I do know the federal boys are interested in you. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, they're putting together an organized crime task force. You made the A list. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - What do you know about it? - Well, not too much, just that they got a name for you. Toy godfather. - Toy godfather, that's cute. - Yeah, I like that. That's funny, you know. It sounds like something they put on for Christmas. Toy godfather. [suspenseful music] Toy godfather. I'm a made mafioso. Not some cannoli movie actor. I killed men. I ran neighborhoods in Queens, in Brooklyn, the Bronx! Now, I'm building a West Coast franchise. And you come into my house and call me toy godfather? - Nicholas doesn't think this, the government does. - Shut up! You, what do you know? You work for any carbone that comes along with a couple of shekels in his pocket. - And you don't? - Yeah, but with me it's different. Now you take Sammy G, the most respected Don of his time. And I whacked him! - Sammy G, Sammy G, always Sammy G! Enough already! - Sammy G taught me very many valuable lessons with his mockery. Every day he'd laugh at me, every day! Coming into our house. Our house! Cutting down our family, killing them all with his filthy bullets. Killing them all except you! - Hey, lighten up, okay, Carlo? Take it easy. - Who the fuck are you? - What are you talking about, who am I? Manny. - Who are you? Who sent you? - Nobody sent me. - Carlo, this is your brother, Nicholas. - He's my brother 'cause you say he is. How do I know which side of the bread you're buttering? You, what do you know, you work for anyone! You wired? - [Nick] Wired? - You're wired! [shirt tearing] - You fucking happy now, Carlo, you happy? Am I wired, am I wired? - You know what destiny is, huh? We were meant to be together. We were made to be brothers. The DA and the player. We shouldn't be here. We should've been killed like Papa and Mama. Nobody was to survive that. But don't you see? We can't die. I mean, look it up, Book of Genesis. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age. [Carlo laughs] - Hey, baby. - Hey. - Let's go to bed, huh?

Hey, I'm talking to you. You got something else going or not? - No, I got no other plans. - Good, so go get dressed. Hey Silvio, get him something to wear. We're going for a ride. - What's wrong with what I'm wearing? - It's business. [suspenseful music] [crane humming] [suspenseful music] [dirt thudding] [suspenseful music] - [Nick Voiceover] Something was up. Although Carlo had seemed to rebound back to his old self, he was in a mood. - [Carlo] Okay, so what do you think of the ride, Nicky? Beautiful, ain't it? - [Nick] Nice, Carlo. - Nice? It's a '65 Lincoln. It's mint condition nearly. There ain't many of 'em around, I picked it up cheap. It cost the owner an arm and a leg. [laughs] See, I got people working on putting a new highway through here, we're ahead of the game. I got 16,000 acres cheap. I'm telling you, Nicky, this is gonna be the next Vegas or Reno. I mean, they got Indian bingo here. They've legalized horse racing. They got off track betting, casino gambling. Hell, even the California State Government's in the numbers business with lotto. My oldest real estate speculation. Palm Springs is gonna be the next boom town. This is the foundation of our new business, kid. Yours and mine. - Carlo, I don't know anything about the construction business. - Hey, the construction business is like sex. You gotta have the right tools, and you gotta know how to use 'em. And you always gotta be the one on top. [motor humming] 'Cause there's always somebody who wants to fuck with ya! Wing, Xiao, my friends! You wanted to meet, Xiao? What can I do for you? - You have not delivered on the promises you have made. - Hey, we could have done this over the phone. I told you what it would take. If you want to meet some heavy hitters on the West Coast, you're gonna have to put up. But you're not interested in judges. You want congressional class juice. That's extra. - Funding is never a source of concern. Results, however, are a different matter. - Yeah? Show me. - [Man] As I have indicated, timeliness is of great significance. - See, this is the construction business for you. I need money to build my new city, and they want my Rolodex. And they're willing to pay dear, you know why? 'Cause they don't see a toy godfather standing here. They see Carlo Augustine, power broker. And for that they pay me respect. Now, I gotta give him an answer, what do I do? You got any answers? - Who's this? - I'm sorry, this is my brother, Nicky. He's like what you call a toy district attorney. [laughs] Hey Nick, this is a Wing, Xiao, Tien. Now, you figure out who's who. Hey, Nicky's a college boy. Very smart. He and me are gonna go into the construction business together, right? - Carlo, I can't be a part of this, you know that? - Oh, sure you can, kid. All you gotta learn is how to say no. [gunshots blasting] [gunshot blasting] [car door slamming] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] Hey, Nick, you okay, huh? [Carlo laughs] Come on, let's get outta here. [suspenseful music] [car doors slamming] Okay, you'll be all right out here, kid. There's an LA bus coming by in a couple of hours. You'll be there before dark. - Carlo, do you even realize what you just did? You committed murder. - What, are you talking nuts, councilor? I just sent a message to the Chinks. Now either they're gonna get with the program or they're gonna come gunning. Either way, you gotta get outta here. [hand patting] It was nice seeing you again. - I'm gonna have to take you in, Carlo. [fist smashing] [Nick coughs] - Now, don't you ever touch me? I don't care who you are, you don't ever touch me? - [Gabrielle] Stop it, Jesus! - Now, he's turning gray. [laughs] Hey, come on, take him to the men's room over there. Get him cleaned up, will ya? Come on, make it snappy! [hands clapping] [Nick groans] [suspenseful music] - Walk! - Can you believe that, my own brother. [tires screeching] [thrilling music] [car door thudding] [gunshots blasting] [cartridge clicking] [thrilling music] [tires skidding] [tires screeching] [thrilling music] [tires rumbling] [fist banging] [insects chirping] [footsteps pattering] - Nick, I'm tired. I don't want to go any further, my feet hurt. I'm just gonna sit here and that's it! - Give me your shoes. - No. - Give me your shoes. I'm gonna take the heels off 'em. - Look, if you wanna stomp around the desert all night, that's fine with me, but I'm staying here. - Great. All right, listen, it's pitch black out here. We'll probably stumble in the cactus all night. I don't want to do that. Okay, we'll stay here, that's fine. Is that all right with you? - That's fine with me. - Great. Let me just. [rock banging] [chain rattling] Hey, Gab, I got, there's some burlap bags in here. Some boots. Pick. What do you think? [object rattles] All right, here, why don't you put these on? Here, put this one on, it's freezing out here. Here, put these on. Give me your feet. [fire crackling] [hands rubbing] - You don't like me very much, do you? - No, you're all right. You know, it's just that-- - I'm just not your type of girl. - You don't have to put words into my mouth. I just don't understand how a girl like you-- - Would be with somebody like your brother, Carlo. - Want to tell me about it? - What? - You and Carlo. I mean, if you don't mind. I mean, we'll be here a while, so it's up to you. - I don't mind. It's like somehow your brother just understood me. Or at least he understood where I was vulnerable, and we connected in that way. - Carlo, vulnerable? - Yeah, he was hurt, and we both knew that about each other. [gentle music] See, my father used to beat on my mom right till the day he died. And that kind of thing just, well, it just affects you in ways sometimes you don't even understand. It's like, I always pick the one guy in the room who's gonna make my life miserable. Maybe it's just that you go with what you know. Like my boyfriend before, Jimmy Simpliotti. - Jimmy Simpliotti? - Jimmy Simple is what they called him. He was the collector for the boys in Atlantic City, which basically meant that he dished out pain. So, you'd pay your visit, and depending on how much money you owed was about the amount of grief that you got. - Sounds like a real nice guy. - Yeah. I was an exotic dancer, and I was working in this club when I met Carlo. The money was good and you get good tips if you sit on the customer's laps, you know, so they can feel you, but I never hooked or anything like that. It was just, you know, just tacky. And Jimmy used to hang out there. And he took a real liking to me, except that he was really crazy and jealous. And so when Carlo came in, and he started treating me really nice. He started paying me a lot of attention, told me I was good, and I was good. And he told me that he knew all these people in show business. And well, Jimmy got all pissed off about it and got in Carlo's face. - Not a good idea, huh? - No. I was supposed to meet Jimmy the next night, and then Carlo shows up instead, and he brought me this heart-shaped candy box. I never saw Jimmy again. - That's when you started seeing my brother? - Yeah. I mean, Carlo decided that for me. [gentle music] Do you have a girlfriend back in LA? - I did. She was a drinker, we... We had to break up. - So, what's it like being a district attorney? - It's a job, you know, just like any other job. I'm just attracted to the bad guys too. [gentle music] - What are you looking at? - You. - Your brother isn't even cold yet. [gentle music] [Nick sighs] [birds warbling] - [Nick Voiceover] The next morning, we followed an old service road, hoping it would lead to somewhere. - Is that where Officer Thorpe was killed? - No, that came later. [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful music] [motorcycle motor humming] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] [motor humming] [tires skidding] [suspenseful music] [tires skidding] [tires skidding] [men chattering] [suspenseful music] [gunshots blasting] [suspenseful music] Stay back. - Let me see! Well, what's happening? - They want us to come out. - So, what do you think? What do you think? - Considering everything, it doesn't look good. Come on. [mud splashing] [motor humming] [suspenseful music] [motorcycle crashing] [rod squelching] [motor humming] [suspenseful music] [tires skidding] Gabrielle, this way! [motor humming] [suspenseful music] [motor humming] [suspenseful music] [tires skidding] [tires skidding] [thrilling music] [tires screeching] [body thudding] [suspenseful music] [car door thudding] [suspenseful music] [objects crashing] [gunshots blasting] [man groaning] [thrilling music] [motor humming] [brake clicking] [cement slapping] [motor buzzing] [machine buzzing] [metal creaking] [cement slapping] [feet smashing] [building crashing] [suspenseful music] Hey, you! [man groans] [body thuds] [car door slams] You okay? - Yeah! Oh, look out! [body thuds] [plank thuds] - [Nick] Let's get the hell out of here. [engine revving] [engine humming] [tires skidding] - I want to wrap up this Officer Thorpe thing. - There was something definitely not right about this officer's procedures. I was just too tired to give a damn. [siren wailing] [suspenseful music] [siren wailing] [motor humming] [radio chattering] Am I glad to see you. - Let me see your driver's license please. - Yeah, sure. Nick August with the DA's office out of LA. - Right, DA's office. - Officer Thorpe, you're not gonna believe this, okay? There's two dead bodies out there. Yesterday somebody killed my brother and his bodyguard. There's a couple of Chinese guys buried in a lot somewhere in Palm Springs. I'm telling you, we had a... What the hell are you doing, man? [groans] - I'm just gonna see if your story checks out. You have the right to remain silent, use it. [radio chattering] And you say that you and the little woman here killed a bunch of armed ninja bandits? - I didn't say they were ninja bandits. They were Triad assassins. - Right, assassins. And they're supposed to be around here somewhere? - I don't know exactly they are, okay? We had to get out of there as fast as we could. Now, what I'm thinking is if we can get a chopper coming from the east, cover this ground, we can catch up to 'em really fast. - Right, chopper. - Oh, for Christ sakes. This is really starting to piss me off. - I'm gonna give you a chance to run because I don't want it to look like you were in custody, you know what I mean? [body thudding] Somebody wants you to disappear real bad. Go on out there a ways. - Officer, you're making a big mistake. [gunshot blasting] [body thudding] [gun thumps] - So, it was Gabrielle that shut Officer Thorpe? - She saved my life. - An officer was shot, and you contacted nobody - I didn't have that option. [romantic music] - So, you went back to Los Angeles and went straight back to your apartment. - I had witnessed five murders. I'm involved in the death of a cop, all in a 24-hour period. [gentle music] I just had to think. But whatever happened next, I knew that I had to take control. [gentle music] [cars humming] [door creaking] [lamp clicking] [flashlight clicking] - Hey, bub. You find anything interesting? - Yeah, you're filing system is a mess. - I'm very disappointed. I thought we were buddies. - That makes two of us. - We're gonna have to take you into custody for the murder of a police officer named Thorpe. Nick, don't! [suspenseful music] [latch clicking] [suspenseful music] [tennis ball thumping] [tennis ball whacking] [body thudding] [footsteps pattering] [garbage bin rattling] [suspenseful music] [racket whacking] [body thudding] [ball thumping] Ah, Nick! Not my new graphite matrix! You're dead meat! [ice cubs rattling] - Hey, Manny! - Hmm? Nicolas, I was worried. - We gotta get outta here, Manny. It was a setup. There's a hit on me and I'm wanted. There's Chinese thugs coming out of the woodwork. I came back to get you, let's go! - Oh, Nicholas, Nicholas, you're talking like your crazy. - Crazy, man, you bet your ass! They just killed Carlo, okay? - Hey, kid, how ya doin'? [chuckles] So, tell me, you think I could make it in Hollywood? - Oh! - Oh, baby, I'm not going nowhere. I'm immortal. [lips smacking] Don't you know that? Hey, what's wrong? Smart college boy like you never heard of a bulletproof vest? - I don't get it. - We had to do a little save face for the Asian connections. It's political, don't worry about it. Besides, I wanted to see which side you were buttering your bread. - [Nick] Did you know? - I knew, but I never approved. - Hey, think of it as hell week at the frat house, college boy. [laughs] - You son of a bitch! [hand slaps] You nearly got us killed! - What, who? - What do you mean who, you had no idea? - Hey, what are you talking here? I faked up a death scene, that's all. I didn't send no... Hey, come on, give me a break. - I just killed three Triad assassins. - Hey. [laughs] My little brother finally made his bones. - Yeah, well Gabrielle made her bones too. She killed a cop. - I can't tell you how proud I am. [laughs] You showed initiative. - I'm not amused. What about the Chinese guys, huh? - Eh, that was just a hit. Just business. Hey, Mr. Wing? You know anything about any Triad assassins? Yeah. I had to do some house cleaning for Mr. Wing. Now, we've got the right people in place. You're looking at the new West Coast Chinese connection. [Wing laughs] And you're in it too, Nick. Keep it in the family. We're gonna do some serious business together. - Would you excuse us, please? I want to talk to Nicholas alone. - More dirty little secrets, Manny? - Oh. - Ciao, babe. [lips smacking] - The truth is I am an old man with very few pleasures. Now, that I look back on my life, I am not very proud of my accomplishments, although I am proud of you. But this is not what I wanted for you. No, this is not at all what I wanted. For you, a judge, maybe a senator. Maybe even president like Jack Kennedy, hmm? But that is not to be. You are involved with Carlo. Fate is playing a cruel game. - I've come to accept it, Manny. Questa e mia familia. - Nicholas, you are not of this family! - What do you mean? - I raised you, not these carbones! You were not to be part of this! - I saw his criminal record, Manny. How did he get to become so powerful? - Well, he's connected, very high up. Someone very powerful is watching over him. And now the Chinese want his allegiance. But it's you I'm worried about. You're dug in, your life is forever changed. You are a gangster. I was young once myself and full of bright ideas. Then I took a couple of cases I shouldn't have. Oh, the money was very good. And soon, I was in. Look, I can arrange to get you out of the country, but you have to act at once. - I can take care of myself. - Can you? You really think so. Then you are in, and I can't help you. - [Carlo] What do you want? I guessed wrong. No, it's family, it's my problem. I'll take care of it. [footsteps pattering] - [Nick] Carlo. - Hey, there he is. - What's going on? - I gotta get outta here, today. - What for? - Killing that cop's bringing too much heat on us. Silvio's bringing the car around. Come on, Gabrielle, let's go. Now! [footsteps pattering] - It's unseasonably chilly today, you should dress warmly. - I got a sweater. - You'll need it. Great. [tires rumbling] [car doors slamming] - Yeah, this is all right. Hey, Silvio, go get the picnic basket out of the trunk. I know you're packing, Nicky, hand it over. Come on, don't play games. Come on. - Carlo, he's your brother. - Shut up. I heard you pick up on the phone last night. - Let's do it. - Start walking. Come on, you, I want you to see this. - God, you're hurting me! - Good, you cheat on me! What, you think I didn't know? - Let her go, Carlo. - One shot, Nicky. You won't even hear it. That's how I took Sammy G out. I shot him right through the ears. They had to bury him in a closed casket, and I laughed at his funeral. 10 years I waited to get close to that prick! Just like I am to you. - Hey, Carlo, you gonna do it? Then you go ahead and you do it. - That a boy, Nicky. Don't beg. Sammy G begged and cried like a baby. And you know what he told me before I blew his brains out? He said, "Killing your Papa was just a contract. "You know, business." - Is this business too, Carlo? - No, this is self-preservation. [suspenseful music] [gunshot blasting] [Gabrielle screaming] [Gabrielle whimpering] I could kill you, don't you know that? - What the hell is going on here? - I'm saving your ass like I always do! Silvio turned, cut his own deal with Wing. He would have whacked you himself. I had to get up close. Hit men. They could smell fear. - You used me as a diversion, didn't you? - Family business, Nicky. You're family, I never forget it. Now, I got one more thing to do for Papa. - Papa's been dead 20 years. When are you gonna let it go? - You want to know the truth, Nicky? I died in that room that day. My whole life's been spent avenging Papa. I'm almost done. But you got a life ahead of you. Now get outta here and take here with you. - Carlo, you come back with me, I'll put you in the witness protection program. I can help you. - You're a good kid, you know that? Here, I want you to have Papa's ring. - I can help the both of you. - I can't, it's destiny. By the time you get back to LA, it'll all be over. - Carlo, you can't leave me here like this. - Hey, Gabrielle, you're the eighth wonder of the world, you know that, hm? [lips smacking] But you gotta go where your bread's buttered right? Now, your bread's buttered with squirt. - I don't want this. - Like Manny always says, you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. [suspenseful music] - Carlo. - I gotta go. Family. [suspenseful music] [gun clicking] [gunshots blasting] [hood clanging] [suspenseful music] - Carlo! [car crashing] [door slamming] [gunshot blasting] [bullet squelching] [gun clicking] [gentle music] [suspenseful music] [gun clicking] [Nick panting] [gun thudding] [suspenseful music] [shoes thudding] [Wing grunting] [fists smashing] [men grunting] [knees smashing] [men grunting] [suspenseful music] [Nick grunting] [pipe whacking] [knife thudding] [body thudding] [suspenseful music] [knife thudding] [suspenseful music] [motor humming] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] [car crashing] [explosion blasting] [lighter clicking] - You know, I gotta confide something in you, Nick. You're like a tar baby of misery. Anyone who touches you dies. By the way. Where's your fucking badge? - I left it in my apartment. You see, I didn't know who the good guys were anymore. - What about Wing, why didn't you kill him? He tried to kill you, he killed your brother. Why didn't you kill him? - The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I didn't have it in me then, and I don't know now, Mr. Winslow. - [Winslow] You're free to go. - Nicholas! - Surprised to see me, Manny? - Oh, Nicholas, you could give an old man a heart attack. - Yeah, if you had a heart. - I since hostility. - Hostility? No. I would say that I'm impressed, but then I've always been impressed with you, haven't I, Manny? - Impressed, that's good? - That's good. Just like you, Manny. - Sit, sit, sit, we'll talk. [chair creaking] - It took me awhile to piece it together. It was a bunch of little things, really. Then I saw the report the FBI had on you. - The FBI? - Yeah. They've been watching you now for over 20 years. - [laughs] That's the trouble with this business. Someone is always watching you. - You covered your ass pretty well, but there was one small fact you overlooked. - Fact, what fact? - You were my father's consigliere. - Yeah, that's true, you knew that. - And then you went to work for Sammy G. - [laughs] Sammy G. When he took over your father's concerns, he took me with him. In this business, you always go where your bread is buttered. - You were heavily connected. You were watching over Carlo. You weren't working for him. He was working for you, only he didn't know it. - In my own way, I was watching over both of you boys. - No, and Carlo was on to you. - On to me? Why should Carlo be on to me? For what? - I remember that day, that terrible day. We were in the living room when they came. The noise was like thunder. [gunshots blasting] [thunder cracking] [suspenseful music] He brought me to you. To you, Manny. You were waiting outside in the car. You knew what was going on. - Nicholas, you hurt me with these accusations. - Come on, Manny. Carlo didn't fake his death to see what I'd do. He wanted to see what you would do. And what did you do? You put a contract out on me. - Oh, you, no. I never sent the assassins after you. That was Silvio's doing, alone. Later I learned that Wing didn't trust you. And I was outraged. - I'm not talking about the assassins. It was the state trooper. You don't buy the state police unless you got a lotta juice. And you got a lotta juice, Manny. And then when I came back, you knew he had to get rid of both of us. - No. Nicholas, I love you. Don't be ridiculous. - The day Carlo died, he knew I was carrying a gun. You told him. You set it up so we'd both shoot it out. [fist slams] [Manny sighs] - So many years, the guilt. I am not a perfect person. This is the hard part. Armand Augustine is not your father. [crickets chirping] You are my son. Nicolas, I love you. Armand Augustine was a brutal man. And he had no vision. I made him great! But all he saw was a fixer, someone to do legal work. Then your mother and I fell in love. It was not supposed to happen that way, but things happen. She couldn't leave her husband. He would have killed us both. Then he found out about us. And then you. He gave Sammy G the hit on me and I turned the tables. Sammy was no Armand, but I made him something. Then Carlo killed him. Carlo could have been even greater, but all he ever wanted was revenge. All that anger he walked around with. And now there's you. - And now you have to get rid of me, don't you, Manny? - May God strike me dead. - Yeah, well you should have when you had the chance. The Feds picked me up the other day. They told me that the hit's out on you. The Triads have you marked for death. You're caught in the middle. - Goddamn! Even in death, Carlo has me by the balls! His hotheaded plan started all of this. [crickets chirping] Can you help me out of this? - No. - You reap what you sow. Well, at least try to save yourself, eh. - Don't worry about me, Manny. I'll be okay. - You know, ironically, I'm very proud of you. Goodbye, my son. - Goodbye, Manny. [birds chirping] [Manny sighs] [glasses clink] [suspenseful music] [knife whooshing] [knife squelching] [glass shattering] [liquor splashing] [soft piano music] [tires rumbling] [soft piano music] [door thudding] - [Nick Voiceover] Why was I under investigation, Anson? - [Anson] What makes you think that? You know, they happened to find your name buried inside another investigation? You had us worried. And were trying to find out... - [Nick Voiceover] Which side I was buttering my bread. - [Anson] No, son of the godfather. I mean, this does not look good on the resume of a district attorney. They found Kohen's body on Tuesday. He'd been dead about 30 hours. Chinese didn't waste any time. [ring thuds] So, what are you gonna do, bub? - [Nick Voiceover] Get on with my life. - [Anson] Where will you go? - [Nick Voiceover] I was thinking about working for organized crimes. - [Anson] Why should they take ya? - [Nick Voiceover] Because I know something about the criminal mind. Now, when I look in the mirror, I don't see myself like I used to. I see Carlo and Manny and Gabrielle. But at least now I know where I came from and where I'm going. And who I am. There's always gonna be a part of me that will ask the question, if Carlo and I had changed places, how would I have turned out? [engine revving] Cain and Abel, they were brothers. One became a killer. It could have gone either way. [soft piano music] [tense piano music] [soft piano music] [tense piano music]
