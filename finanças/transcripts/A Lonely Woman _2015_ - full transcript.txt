Please don't die on me! I'll take you to the hospital, please! Who's that, Max? - Max said you weren't supposed to be there. We were to just shake the ace down. Make it look like a robbery. - To make it look like a robbery? Why? Why? What other reason were you supposed to be there for? Tell me about this Max. - I only know him as Max Black. He's just a hired gun. - A hired gun? Who hired him? Who hired him? Please don't die, please! - The son. It's for the inheritance. - Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! - The son? Inheritance? What the hell?

In there. My secretary smokes. In her desk. - That sounds like a good idea. Now, if you move from there, then I shoot you again. Do you understand? Good. I'll be back, don't go anywhere. - You fuckin' crazy bitch! - I told you, don't move. - What do you want? - We're gonna have a little chat. We need to talk about the Arlington's will. - Arlington? Annie? - Shut the fuck up! Who paid you to change it? - I dont know what you're talking about. It was Roger! It was a deal with Roger and I! Dave changed the will, and left everything to you, and I dont know how Roger found out. He came to me. - You son of a bitch! Then you two murdered my parents? I had no idea Roger was gonna kill anybody. I mean, that's crazy. I changed the will after Dave and Martha were already dead. - Who's Max Black? How about Bill? - I dont know. - And Hector, have you ever heard of them? - I dont know'em. I'm tellin' you the truth. I dont know 'em. I dont know any of 'em, I'm tellin' you the truth! - And you never will. Because I took care of them already. Was Steven involved? - I don't think so, I mean, I dont know. I was dealing with Roger, and he never said Steven was involved. I dont know. - So, I guess now it's your turn. - No, no, please don't kill me! No, please, please! I can fix it! You need me Annie, I can't say anything, right? I would go to jail! You're robbing me? This is a donation... For the Foundation of Abused Women of Texas. You call Roger, and then Max Black, and you tell them... Tell them Jezebel is coming. - Who? Are you aware you're a crazy bitch? I know. Next time you call me crazy bitch, I'm gonna kill you. - Hey! Wake up! Get up! Come on. - Hey. - I need you to grab all your stuff and get out. Because I'm movin' in. - What? - Come on now, you heard me. You don't live here anymore. - What do you mean? - This house is mine now. And I don't want you here. - Are you giving me money to get my own place because my cards were cut... - Money? You're out of your freakin' mind. With the keys. The keys to the DeLorean. They over here? Lisa! Get all her shit out of the car, put it in this bag, and bring it back when you're done. - Asshole! - And where am I supposed to go? I have no money, my credit cards were canceled, you were supposed... - Get a fuckin' job, Annie! Okay. I really don't freakin' care. Get a fuckin' job. - I can't take it anymore! I can't take it! I'm in Limbo. I'm in Limbo. The nightmare I left behind when they brought me here has come back to trap me again. This time it won't let go. I feel dead. Empty. I don't want to be alive. But I don't wanna be dead. I don't wanna sleep. But I don't wanna be awake. I don't wanna be alone. But I don't want anybody with me. They took everything I had. Now, I'm back at the orphanage, and this time, no one's coming for me. I'm a walking dead. - How come you didn't mention that to us before? How do I know you didn't just pick it up out of the park? - Aren't you gonna check it out? - I find it very interesti that you've never mentioned it before. - So what? Hey listen, this could be a lead, oy! Why would anyone living out of town be running by my house? Why? Think of it! - Okay. If looks could kill, I'd be dead. - Hi! How are you? Come here. More, come here, closer. Sit next to me. This is for me? Thank you. You're very sweet. What's your name? You don't wanna tell me your name. At least you like me, but you don't wanna tell me your name? That's okay. You can't hear. And you can't speak. Whoa. Well... Neighbor. My name is Annie. I'm your new neighbor. Jezebel? - And just tell this guy to just get out of the car, you know what I'm sayin'? - I keep calling you. You never return my calls. Have you gone to Houston to talk to that guy? - Okay, you listen to me carefully. - No, you listen to me, you haven't done shit! You are a good for nothing useless cop, that's what you are. If you're not gonna do anything... - I'm getting really tired of you. Okay, I understand your pain, but we're doing our job and you don't... - Are you gonna do something about my parent's murder, yes or no? Because if you're not, then I will. - What are you trying to say? - And believe me, you won't like it. - What are you doin'? You're hitting my target. - Okay, are you gonna stand there and look stupid? Or are you gonna help me? - Wow, okay, okay. Do you see that nine? You wanna aim right for that nine. Shoot for the heart.

What does that mean? - Don't worry, it's a good thing. - How much did it cost you? - Yeah, don't worry about that either. I get a big discount. - Okay, well, don't come for me tomorrow.

But I'll call you okay, bye. - Wait, Jez. Give me a beer. - What kind? - I don't give a shit, a cold one. - I'll see that last card. - If you come I'll give you a tip. And your phone number. - Who's the owner of that bike outside? - It's mine. - Are you man enough? - What's the bet? - Your bike. Cards? - Two. - You bitch, there were five aces. - I want a beer. Charge it to him, okay. - So, this is my little place. - This is one of your pieces? - Yeah, that's one of my recent pieces. - So, where is your art? - My what? Yeah, I'm workin' on a few pieces. - Where are they? I wanna see them. - Later, here, drink your beer. Let me play some music for ya'. - What are you doing? - Relax, it's okay. - No. No! I said no! I'll take that. Sorry if I mislead you, but I have to go okay, so. - You're not goin' anywhere, bitch! - Send Max after before she finds out the truth. She's gonna come after you. Believe me. Don't mess with her, she's a bad ass. Look at me! There is no other way. You gotta do her too. Call up your guy Max, and have him take care of it. Man, you should've seen her eyes. It was like lookin' at death itself. - You don't know worry about anything. I've got a plan. - Hello, Annie. You haven't called me. You know, we checked on him. The wallet you gave us. - You did? - Yeah, sure did. You don't wanna know what we found out? We found him. Except we couldn't get a statement out of him because he was riddled with bullets. - Let me get this right. Was it A, you were looking for him and found him dead? Or B, somebody else found him dead, and you realized it was the same person? - Annie. Could I take a look at your bike? - What do you expect to find? - Nothing in particular. Unless, you have something to hide. - No, of course not. And the answer is no, I don't want you to check my bike. - Well, I insist. Can I please check your bike, Annie? - I said no! - Annie, I insist that I check your bike! - Okay. As you wish. - Okay. See you soon, Annie. - Are you into fashion detective? - No, just a nice jacket. - Well, you know, they don't sell it to some people. - What do you think? - Why all you girls hate each other? - What? - She looks different. - Yeah, she does. Listen, I want you to follow her for a few days. - That won't be a problem. I like the new look, shoot, she look good. - You pig. - You're the one that convinced me not to do my sister, and now she's out being some rambo. A God damn vigilante. - Your sister? You're funny, Steven. - There are two pictures of her. - This is the angel? - She's goin' after Roger right now. When she takes care of him, you take care of her. - You'll be informed. - Hey, you know, that talkin' about that round of golf? What about next Thursday? - Yeah, Thursday. - Okay, Thursday it is. - Hey neighbor, it's easy, it's a girl. I never forget a favor. If you do this, you're in. Jezebel! - Hey! I'm unarmed! Don't shoot. - Do you have a lighter? Are you stupid? A lighter. - No, I don't have a lighter. - Hey, I know what you're thinking. This crazy bitch is just gonna shoot me in the head. Nah, why would I do that? We're just gonna have a little chat. Then I'll shoot you in the head. - Shit! - Annie. Annie, you scared the hell out of me. - Surprised to see me here, brother? - Well, yeah, I'm surprised. How did you get in? Annie, look... Lizette and Johanna aren't here right now. - I know your wife is not here. But you and I... We're gonna have a little chat. I think you should answer that. - Hello? Yes, he's my brother, why? Bad news? What? My God. At his house, are you sure? Yes, detective, I'll be there as soon as I can. - Does the name Antoine ring a bell? - Antoine? No. - I'm sorry, you might know him as Max. Max Black? - Nope, never heard of him. Now, look, I've gotta get to the police station. What's goin' on? - He's gone too, you know. He won't be able to help you. You remember Proverbs 28:13? Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses them, and renounces them finds mercy. - Annie, I have no idea what you're talking about. - Really. - Are you out of your fuckin' mind? - I gave Roger the same chance I'm giving you. You better start renouncing your sins. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - I'll count to three. If you don't come clean, I'll shoot you. One. Two. - Roger had nothing to do with it. You killed an innocent man. It was just me. I had no choice. Please believe me, I had no choice. And then he said he was gonna take Roger and me off the will. And leave everything to you. Please don't kill me. I've confessed. - Steven... I didn't know. - What? - If I had known, you wouldn't be alive right now. - What? What are you talking about? - No... You have no idea what you did. You not only killed our parents, but you also killed me, and the worst part of it, I'm still alive. I'm a walking dead. And now it's time for you to go to hell. Annie! Annie, think about Lizette. Annie, think about Lizette. If you kill me, she'll be fatherless just like you were. You'll need these. Goodbye, my brother. - You go and kill that bitch. You go after here and you kill her, okay. You go and kill her! - Jezebel, we need to talk. Let's meet up tomorrow night at Watermans. Hands on the table. Put your hand on the table... - Sir. Can I get you something to drink? - Coffee, decaf. - Okay. - Jez... Or should I say Annie? I didn't know it was you. You gave me a fake name, and the picture looks nothing like you. I'm truly sorry. - I'll kill you. - You need to walk away. I know Steven will give you anything you want, anything you need. And forget all this. - You and Steven are dead. - Steven is my client. If you want him, you have to go through me. - Okay. So be it. - God dammit! I could have killed you yesterday, and I didn't. - We all make mistakes. - You don't have a chance. - We'll see. - You're so... - Tomorrow. 6 AM. I'll be waiting for you, you know the place. - Listen to me, and listen to me carefully. If you don't walk away, I will have no mercy on you. You can't win. Let it go. - Don't be late or I'll find you. - Jez, look, you and I, we're special. We're the same. We can't face off against each other. That's not fair to you and that's not fair to me. - Here you go. - You're all I have. You're a lost soul, just like me. I've never even told anyone my real name before. We have a connection that's out of this world. Killing you would be like killing myself. Please, I'm begging you. I don't wanna lose you. - You son of a bitch, I'm nothing like you! You killed my parents for money, filthy money! How much you got paid? Was it enough? - They weren't even your real parents. Why can't you get that through your head? And you tell me about killing? Those two guys you killed, they weren't aware of my intention to kill your folks. I brought them along to make it look like a robbery. And Roger? That drug addict didn't have nothing to do with anything. Killing is killing regardless of the reason. It was not for money. - Whatever the reason. - They were criminals, okay. And I did what I had to do. - Please, spare me your stupidity! We are all criminals! We all are, and we all deserve to die for this for whatever reason. - My parents were not criminals. - Your parents were also criminals. That's why I do what I do. - My parents... - There is no one clean on this earth. Yes, I kill for money, but they had something in the closet that they should die for. I just don't care to find that out. - You're out of your freaking mind. You have no idea what you're talking about! Why in the hell would my parents be criminals? - Well, for raising two kids like Steven and Roger. That's criminal enough. - And I thought I was the crazy one. - If I get up from this table, you become just another target to me. Don't break my heart. - Get out of my face. - You know what? You should have seen them. Poor old bastards. Don't shoot me, please don't shoot me. Yeah, and what I told them, "Here's a little present from your son, Steven." Go get her! - Antoine. - Using my real name won't help you. - Give me a second chance. A duel. Let me die the way I want. - A duel? You still think you can beat me. - You fuckin' coward! - Fine, if that's the way you wanna die... You'll get your duel. It's behind you! - Always the heart. - Smart, but not fair. - Life is not fair you worthless piece of shit! - Go to hell, bitch. - You go first. - You won't Jez. You can't kill me. - Dammit. - I'll be back, don't go anywhere. - Awe shit. - Max, it's Steven. I haven't heard from you in a few days, I need to know what's goin' on. I need you here with me, now talk to me, call me back. - Daddy! - Hi sweetheart! My gosh! Now, Daddy's making a call, so you go play. Don't go near the water though, okay. - My God! Lizette? Lizette! - Mom. - Are you okay, honey? Don't look, don't look sweetie. My God! - What happened? - You were in a coma. For almost six or seven weeks. I've already called Johanna, and she's on her way over with Lizette. - Lizette? - She was able to fool that man who murdered your parents. Steven and Roger, they hired that hit man And he shot you too, don't you remember? - And Roger too? This man, he turned against them, and ot Steven. - And Roger? - Roger, they found him dead with two prostitutes, died from a heroin overdos - Hello Annie, listen... Could you see the man that shot you? Could you tell us about him to our sketch artist? Anything. I know he shot you at point blank. I know you probably saw something, right? - No. - Annie, come on, he murdered your parents. He almost killed you and your niece. Just think for a moment. He's leaving bodies everywhere. You've gotta remember, please try, try to remember. We can't find... - Detective, enough, enough. - Okay, I'm sorry. Ashton, our hero, he found the revolver in the guy's apartment. The one that he used to shoot you, and the same one he used to murder your parents. We even found your picture in his apartment. I'm glad you're doing a lot better Annie. Ma'am. Let's go Ashton. Brought your favorite cookies. Catch you later. - Annie, omorrow we're going home, and we're gonna be a family, a real family. - A family. Aunt Laura! No! You bastard! (upbeat rock music
