THREE HOURS AGO A warm kebab for 2 o'clock, please. WESTIN HOTEL, ROOM 607 What do you have to say about the missile test results? NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE UNDERCOVER VEHICLE The estimates you gave us they're off by over two kilometers. RUSSIAN ARMS BROKER YURI Our technicians weren't present for the test. Smaller arms and the older missiles are not the problem. We worry... - What's going on here all of a sudden? - Man, the consulate is off today too. Get this thing to work so I can hear clearly. NIS BERLIN STATION - Raise the volume. - Hold on, please. Hey, it's not time for contract yet. Did you get a close-up of his face? We don't see a match. CIA, MI6, no match whatsoever. Haven't seen a ghost in a while. If you don't purchase the new missiles, We'll not provide the additional weapons. ANTI-IMPERIALISM ARAB LEAGUE ASIM And then we ran another test with North Korean technicians. What do you say? I said make it louder! Let's talk another time. My approach is let's keep going. NORTH KOREAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN SECRET CORRESPONDENCE ROOM I don't make the decisions. I only follow orders. Yeah, but you have a young leader now. You must be more flexible, comrade. Flexible? Your claim to oppose imperialism, but negotiating with this imperialistic logic? Our terms are non-negotiable. NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR IN BERLIN RI HAK-SU Excuse me. What's the problem with you two? You came to sign the contract, not negotiate. Let us... This is the most reasonable deal that I've seen in years. You're both being stubborn. - You're slaves to the... - I can not match his price in dollars! Then what about Euros? I can speak to him about this at least. Okay, helpers. Get ready. First, you sign the paper. Then you get the money. The transfer first. Action. Action! CREDIT TRANSFERRING Okay. Yeah. Cut! The contract is over. Helpers, get out now. This is the Mossad! Our clean up squad is here in ten minutes. ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE AGENCY MOSSAD DAGAN Don't make this any worse than it already is. We can end this here. We've got no interest in your weapon's deal. We're only here for Russian broker and the Arab. You've got plenty of other clients to do business with. Target is on the roof. Move underground to the hallway on the other side. Distance from target... Let's not make a scene. Do they teach you to aim at the temple in the South? I just need to know the transaction history and the exchanged items. I turn my head, and you'll miss. Fine, but I need you to come with me first. How badly did you mess up to cause a stir at the consulate, the embassy, and the Blue House? You know there's no way around open fire involving national intelligence. Now, tell me what I can report back to the Blue House. - We have a report on the incident... - Did you record the conversation? Does it say what's being exchanged? You can't confirm what's on that contract. There's no record of the dialogue. What exactly were you recording? I had the gun right in front of me. What more evidence... And our agent busted his back because of that commie. We are at a disadvantage given the international law. Threat with no clear evidence an outburst and to say that North Korea... Why are you putting that blame on us? What the hell. That North Korean agent suspect, I hear there's no record of him? Are we sure he's from the North? Who's going to take responsibility for this mess and how? I asked, who and how. Shit Mr. Kang and his Berlin team, Get ready to disband. Investigator, sir. How does disbanding solve this problem? There were teams from other countries on the site. Other countries? Hand it to me. What we are trying to uncover is not an arms exchange deal. Kim Jong-il moved funds from Europe to Macau right before he died. We are after this secret account that holds four billion dollars. Once we locate that account, we can get the information on aids from other countries to North Korea. You are not one to make mistakes. What happened? Yuri was an arms broker already on the American radar. It would've been easy for South Korea to track him. Asim is anti-American, yet it was Israeli intelligence that showed up. One of the three leaked. Either the Russian sold it to the Israeli, or the Arab was a double spy for Mossad. If neither... It would be one of us. Hey, Pyo Jong-sung... Get your head on straight. Jong-sung... listen to me carefully. Do you know who's coming from Pyongyang as we speak? Dong Myung-soo is on his way. Why would they send him when you are already out here? Pyongyang doesn't trust us. All the higher ranks are under special surveillance since Kim Jong-un stepped up. Even Republic's hero like you is under watch now. - You better watch out, or else... - Comrade ambassador... have you forgotten why I'm here? Are you trying to... I won't put your words down in the official records today. Do you see me as nothing more than a subject of surveillance? It's disheartening to see you weaken like this. These are only assumptions and circumstantial evidence. Where's the actual intelligence? Intelligence. How do you expect to get assigned to the US at this rate? That Jung Jin-soo under you. He acted out in Libya too, right? Guys like him still whining over commies will only get in your way. I hope I won't be seeing his name on future reports. You take care of him then. Let's talk with results. I told you not to go to Korean restaurants. Are you upset that I didn't cover for you? No, sir. Today is my birthday. So I wanted some seaweed soup. I saw this place didn't have any Koreans and asked if they can make me some seaweed soup. I should've told you about the account earlier. I missed the right time to tell you. Since when was there a right time to tell me these things? Don't you think about my position? We aren't after some industry spy here. We have something called a political stance. Shut up, asshole. What political stance with North Koreans? We don't even take a left at a roundabout. In any organization, when you go up as high as I do, you value someone who listens more than someone who's good at his job. Do you know why you haven't moved up? You make others uncomfortable. What are you doing here then? I must make you uncomfortable. I get it. I'm about to leave. What do you want me to do anyway? I don't care if you let go of me, or if you are appointed to the US. But Ho-gil, who was beaten by that commie today... he'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. So, do your job. I'll do mine. Upstairs, please. He's already here. He wanted to meet here today... so he picks up the check, right? Didn't I tell you to take your ring off for external meetings? Being a good interpreter isn't just about delivering the message. At Bundestag, there was some mention about North Korean diplomats It seems the Austria incident... caught smuggling cigarettes. ...with the North Koreans is an issue. Why is the German parliament concerned with what happened in Austria? As I explained earlier... it was an error in the document. If this happens again, in other countries, the German government can't help anymore. We need to clarify our position on the smuggled goods so that... We gave them food when we were hungry. And this is what we get in return. 10:00 PM TRAM LINE M1 AM KUPFERGRABEN I just need something solid to convince Bundestag with. You know how it works. Everything that happens need to be recorded... in Germany. Looks like he set up quite a feast to go after the crumbs. Perverted bastard. Take good care of him. That bastard. He wants to fix this at a personal level. We need to clarify our position on the smuggled goods so that... We gave them food when we are hungry, and this is what we get in return. Hey! What brings you here? Without calling first. You are late. You must be tired. Wash up and sleep. Take good care of him. - Let's treat your wound first. - Don't worry about it. No message from Pyongyang? Like what? We were supposed to leave a long time ago. We don't make the decisions. We just follow orders. We could at least apply to return. When was the last self-criticism at the embassy? Can't you ask me why first? I guess I was wrong. I forgot you were the hero of the Republic more so than you are my husband. Oh my God! Oh my God! Help, somebody. She's dead. WAITRESS COMMITS SUICIDE BY OVERDOSING Let's find a new way to meet up. Kids these days... they try these fancy new techniques. Always end up getting their asses handed to them. Then there's guys like you and me. Two old dogs with old tricks... but we're still kicking. Enough with the "old dogs". It really makes us sound old. I hate to break it to you, pal, but we are old. So... what can Uncle Marty do for his favorite ally? I need to know... if that guy's in your database. A North Korean? Black or white ops? A ghost. You heard about the Westin Hotel kidnapping two days ago, didn't you? - He was there. - You were there too? Fuck! You knew my team was tracking Asim and his network. Way to bend me over the barrel, pal. I had no time. If I'd gotten the fucking commie, I was going to hand in the others as my present. Well to hell with your present. You told me you'd leak any intel you had n the North weapons deals. - Now you tell me the shit hit the fan... - Shut up. I got you a very special present. "I got you a very special preset." A guy named... Sigmund. The chairman of the Advice Minister had a meeting with the North Korean ambassador. At the end, the ambassador told his female translator... to take good care of Sigmund. I'm going home at the end of the month, alright? The only thing I want on my plate right now... - is my wife's home cooking. Sorry. - Hey, hold up. Your Foreign Affairs would love it. That took longer than I thought. I had to take care of something upon arrival. I wasn't told about that. You'll know why when you see. In my day, we never had conflicting commands. Always just a single command. That's not how it's done these days. The new comrade chairman doesn't like the old ways. You recognize her right? Yeah, I go there often. The German do too. So do the South Koreans. Comrade ambassador... Pyongyang thinks there's a mole in our Berlin office right now. That's not possible. "Those who appear the most trustworthy deserve the most suspicion." Words of comrade Stalin. - Did you report it to the Party? - I left a record of it. But wouldn't it be better coming from you rather than me revealing it through an investigation? What if there's no evidence? So you'd say the Party was wrong to say there was a leak? Well, now. You'd be saying the Party was wrong. That would make the Party incompetent. Say that again. Who sold the information? The woman... the interpreter for the Embassy. They made the reservation under the name Ryun Jung-hee The waitress that was a spy for South Korea turned herself in. You know that's not true. Are you saying that Dong Myung-soo forged the confession? Whether he did or not doesn't matter. That an official evidence recorded by the Party dispatch contains your wife's name is what matters. A name they wanted to hear at that. If you try to protect her when the Party says she's guilty... you'll be guilty too. There's no real evidence other than this confession. You were the one that said... it could be one of us that leaked the weapons deal intel. From where I stand, I need to provide immediate answers. Or at least an alternative. How much do I have? Two days. Black clouds are coming in... but there's nowhere to hide from the rain. Are you sure it was this woman? Yes. How's work these days? Same old. What you said about Pyongyang the other day... was it because you wanted to go back? Let's not talk about that. I believe that we can live proud even if we are poor. We get three that reside in Germany with more than 85% match. Two have identifiable points. Let's look at this travel agency guy. This one doesn't have many pictures. The only one we have is from when he got the cultural exchange award. Okay. Shit! Hey, you interested in something hot? What? A North Korean official stationed in Berlin just filed for defection. To America? No, he's asking for political asylum through the UN to some third country. When's the next contact? What's going on? You never call during the day. I had to stop by the embassy. Have you had lunch? I had to go to the Bundestag Library. I don't think we can do lunch together. Okay, see you at home. Moran Peak 4639. Checking on comrade Ryun Jung-hee's sign-out logs. The next station is Brandenburger Tor. Nothing on record. Is the Bundestag Library at Brandenburger? That's closer to the Bundestag station. What's at Brandenbrug? That's where the embassies are. British and US embassies too. List this as a secret correspondence. I'll report it myself. Are you going out? You didn't say anything to me. US EMBASSY When is the next... When is the next contact... When is the next... When is the next contact... Long time no see. We still have two days. Did you put a tail on Jung-hee? I'm not here to discuss your wife. Man, how did you end up like this? So thorough outside and yet a wreck at home. Something's not right here. Is that an official statement? We'll know soon enough. I'm not saying you did anything wrong. The guilty will have to stand for their own crimes. So why are you really here? There's a bit of a situation. It's not my job so I can't intervene. Look at this. What a happy family. We have a traitor seeking exile. Someone from the embassy. It's comrade Ri Hak-su. Comrade Ri Hak-su took out all funds from the embassy safe today. DEVICE WILL SELF DESTRUCT AFTER PLAYING Your password will be verbally confirmed upon point of contact. The agent's key-phrase is, "It looks like it's going to rain." Your answer, verbatim, is, "But I've lost my folding umbrella." Here's the time and place of contact. Hey, what's taking you so long? What? What's taking me so long? You're the one that wanted some private time with the guy. We're gonna head to the US Embassy and into the safe house. - You mean the laundromat? - Excuse me, do you speak English? We got about... three hours until the official time of contact. So, factoring in travel, I can spare you about an hour. We can tell him you work for the company. You're helping us with the debrief. And that's as far as you and I take this. After that, it's every old dog for himself. And regardless of what happens here, the CIA has no affiliation, what so ever, with this operation. There should be absolutely no records, you hear me? What's he offering you? Yeah, we're not sure yet. He mentioned something about a file. Some shady account they've been managing. The Kim Jong-il account from Macau? Oh, sweet Jesus. Now wouldn't that make everyone's fucking day. You owe me, pal. Big time. Eleven o'clock. Target's location confirmed. Look more natural, will you? You tapped my phone? Are you out of your mind? That's CIA's target! How is the North Korean ambassador CIA's target? He's ours. If you don't know shit, get out of the way. I'll take responsibility for this. Hey, you bastard! He's moving towards the subway. A follow and B go to the other side. We need to get him first. Jong... Jong-sung. Think hard. Save the talk for later. Freeze! Put the gun down! This is our turf. You don't want any more trouble. Hey, I'm sorry. You listen carefully. Get back to headquarters, and bring me any information... on the CIA agents here. - But the CIA... - Shut up, you bastard. If you ever talk back to me again, or get in my way, I'm gonna fucking blast your brains out you bastard. - I got to... - What did you do in school? I got to do a ballet. And... would you, was it fun? Say something. Hi Daddy, I love you! - Goodbye. - No... We have... Come on, Cindy. You know my team was tracking Asim and his network. Way to bend me over the barrel, pal. Hey, it's me. Send me the address of that travel agency. Why'd you do it? Think about it. Why do you think Dong Myung-soo is here? Why's your wife being suspected of being a spy? You were willing to throw away your family and run off to the west. We are only puppets in Dong Myung-soo's, no, his dad, Dong Jung-ho's plot to take over the Berlin office. How do you think Dong Jung-ho survived despite supporting King Jong-nam not Kim Jong-un? Because he lent a hand when Kim Jong-un's affiliates wanted to sell weapons abroad. CIA TRACKS DOWN ILLEGAL NORTH KOREAN ACCOUNT IN MACAU Now that the secret Macau account is uncovered by the Americans his family needs a new ploy in order to survive. What exactly did you ask Jung-hee to do? You aren't listening to a word I say. Jong-sung When you are stuck at sea, sing Arirang a half-key lower, and for the chorus, sing Whistle. The Party would like a direct report. Tell me what they want to hear. I'll say exactly that. Just don't make me die a painful death. Please. You really don't care about your family in Pyongyang, do you? There's not much I can do, anyway. One would think we were falsely accusing him. Name. Affiliation. Ri Hak-su, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Berlin Embassy. Ambassador. So why'd you betray us? I just sent you the address of the travel agency. I see frequent address changes. It really looks like a front company. Don't I need to report this to Mr. Kang? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Hello. There's been a break-in at my building. The address is Einstenufer 9D. It's a travel agency. What happened? What about you? Why did you lie about where you were? - Don't you have something to tell me? - So you knew all about it? You weren't going to tell me? I don't know where to start. I guess I missed the right time. Start from the beginning. It was an order from the Ambassador. - Not something I'd wanted. - You haven't told me what I want to hear. I must not know what you want. What the hell have you been up to? What do you want me to do then? Entertaining is part of the command. But... the child I carry is ours. This male traveler asked about the festival in the plaza, so I told him when it was. And this is where the gynecologist is. Why didn't you tell me? I was afraid you'd think it wasn't ours. It doesn't matter what I think. Just tell me the truth. This is the truth. If this is the truth, why didn't you say so? Did you ever listen to me? Do you know how it feels to stoop so low just so we can live? Our first child... was gone so fast, I can't even remember. It's already been two years. How painful it must've been for such a little thing. Have you thought about that? So? Were you going to get rid of this child? That's all you can come up with? We'll go to the doctor tomorrow. - If you are lying... - I'll be reported as a spy? That would make you feel better, huh? Because the Party said I'm a spy. Comrade Ri Hak-su tried to defect to the west today. Write down what you did in the past week. Leave nothing out. Hey, did you get her to confess? - We still have time left. - Shucks. I'm disturbing your alone time, aren't I? How'd Ri Hak-su's investigation go? It went well, thanks to you. He will be repatriated back to Pyongyang. Good job. I don't have evidence to prove Jung-hee's charges yet. You can relax now. Hey... congratulations. You've passed the Party election test. All of this was because of Ri Hak-su. Since the death of comrade chairman, we noticed a significant decrease in the foreign currency coming into Pyongyang. You see, the Party had the hunch that Ri Hak-su would rake in private assets and seek asylum, while we were busy building up support for comrade Kim Jong-un back North. But then they had your name on the list too. Myself included, we all said you would never do that. But the Party has its stance. So I suggested a test. Well, well. How could the Party suspect someone who'd turn in his own wife when things go sour? Well then, our agents will be at your place shortly. You go on to Pyongyang, get congratulated, and come back here with a new promotion. Congratulations. You saved my face too. How far did you hear? You are a coward. What the hell are you doing? Once they find out what you're doing to me, you're a fucking dead man! What do you think will happen to you? Today, a North Korean fucking commie blew a hole through my friend's head. At Bradenburg gate? My friend was CIA tracking Asim's group. If I report your ID and tell them that Israel is working with... the North Koreans who took Asim, your fucking face will be on every CIA watch list before 48 hours. What now? Do you want to call a diplomatic dispute with America over this? About a month ago Pyongyang contacted Mossad Collections. I'm not here to discuss your wife. So thorough outside, and yet a wreck at home. Man, how did you end up like this? The guilty will have to stand for their own crimes. They told us that if we gave them the opportunity to replace a few of their people in Berlin, then they'd hand over the man they do business with, Asim. The weapons deal had to fail. It was the opportunity they needed. Did someone on the inside betray the North? I only know what I need to know. But I think the North Korean agent at the scene was double-crossed. Noise level suddenly rose inside the house, watch out. WIRE TAPPED You have the phone records from that time? You want those? REPORTING YOU TO THE PARTY, NEVER TOLD DONG MYUNG-SOO THAT I have recorded everything you've said here. HEARD ABOUT BEING REPORTED FROM YOU FIRST HOW CAN I PASS THE TEST WHEN I NEVER REPORTED YOU? IT'S A TRAP. WE MUST RUN! Do you want to delete it? Then you're gonna give me your conversation with the fucking commie! Did you pack up? I need to take a record for the report. Looking for this? These idiots. I told them to be careful. Why weren't they more cautious? Hello? Abdul. Hello? Sorry I'm late. So you heard what happened to your brother? The Mossad executed him without a trial. I found the rat who gave your brother Asim over to the Israelis. If you get on it now, you can still catch him. Who is it? It's someone we both know. Pyo Jong-sung. Take it. There was a police report on a gunfight. One of the residents there is an interpreter at the North Korean embassy. Hey... You can tap the CIA satellite communication monitoring network, right? Send over all channels within 20 km radius from the site. Are you crazy? Didn't I tell you to just do as you're told, bastard? I know you're good at wire-tapping. - See you again. - Watch your back. You're going to run into the Mossad again one day, and it won't be pretty. Stop blabbering for God's sake. Do you have a room? I prefer to not fill out the register. You okay? Let's treat your wound first. Hey, Policeman. I'm from the Consulate. I'm here to ID the victim, okay? Can you speak English? - Nein. - No? We got a call from a Korean news source. No problem, just a moment. Gunshot. Head, chest. Precisely one shot each. Not circumcised. Judging from teeth definitely North Koreans. Hey, I need to run now. - Hey, halt! - I'll be right back. Those bastards... Fine. He killed all of our comrades and escaped. He's good, huh? He's good, huh? Okay. First, have your men search every hotel within ten kilometers. Their names will not be on record, so look for a couple who paid in cash and checked in in the last ten minutes. How certain are you of this? It's what he taught me. If you're being hunted, hide right under the hound's nose. Hello? This is a direct order from the boss. Search every hotel within ten kilometers. You're looking for a man and woman who paid cash and didn't register. - I'm sending you their pictures now. - Okay. North Koreans, Abdul, and Asim are all on the CIA satellite network. - They're using Arabic. - Arabic? Location? Concentrated within 10 km from the site of incident. Give us the traitor. I'd like to... but I need to get them back as a set. Hey listen, man... If I become the director in Berlin, then we cut out the broker. Everything is cheaper and faster. We can pack up some super notes for you, if you want because no one makes better dollars than we do. But that's only after you drag out this bastard's corpse, isn't it? Trust me. Where are you now? It's a couple? KOOMERS BANK LOGIN SORRY, COULD NOT MATCH LOGIN PASSWORD PLEASE TRY AGAIN Jong-sung, when you are stuck at sea sing Arirang a half-key lower. For the chorus, sing Whistle. ARIRANG SHEET MUSIC You see, the Party had a hunch that Ri Hak-su would rake in private assets and seek asylum because Dong Jung-ho lent a hand when Kim Jong-un's affiliates wanted to sell weapons abroad. But then, your name was on the list too. Now that the Macau account was found by the Americans... ...his family needs a new ploy in order to survive. How could the Party suspect someone who'd turn in his own wife when things go sour? Think about it. Why would Dong Myung-soo be here? And why suspect your wife of being a spy? Listen to me carefully. Dong Myung-soo is working on a plot to blame me for leaking some information on the embassy's secret account. Make Ri Hak-su and me traitors and swallow whole the Berlin embassy with his father. If that's true, what are you doing here? Can I go to Pyongyang now? This is the end for us. Where are you going? I can prove this all to the Party. Trust me. The Party, the people, the country they can all doubt me, but you... you shouldn't have. Are you saying you'll seek asylum? You should be punished for being so cruel. You can kill me anytime but not now. We're not here to kill you. But if you resist, we have no choice. You've ten seconds to choose. One, two, three, four... We three will live no matter what... ...six, seven, eight, ...Only focus on that. ten. Gun! You only got the woman? What about the other one? You said there would be only two. You gave out incorrect information. There was another man there. What? Another guy? A Yankee? They said he looked like you. It's a South Korean. Wow... Welcome South Korean guy! Damn, what a gutsy move. This will be interesting. Let me get this straight. My team breaks up the arms deal Yuri set for Asim, and you'll hand both of them over to us? I don't believe you. Now, bastard, if you want to hear the rest, drive. Well, it's been a while, hasn't it? This is why I like you. Why do you think I let you go at the hotel that time? Macau to Berlin. Weapons deal, spy at the embassy, murder, and asylum. How do I even begin to put these together to make sense of them? Ri Hak-su's hidden card, that account. Four billion dollars left behind by Kim Jong-il. That would make sense. Now that Kim Jong-il is dead, they need to switch over the account to Kim Jong-un to restructure the line of command, but Ri Hak-su and Pyongyang aren't on best terms. Pyongyang thinks that this diplomat doesn't have confidence in the new young leader. Best to get rid of him before he turns against them. And you got squeezed in as a wholesale package deal. It's all over for you. You are wrong. It's not the Republic that betrayed me. Do North and South use different words these days? If you must know, get the facts right. This is all Dong Jung-ho's doing. Who? The father of the guy that shot your friend underground. The account doesn't belong to chairman. It's for Dong Jung-ho and other officials. Ri Hak-su was part of that before he got thrown out. Where's that bastard right now? Pyo Jong-sung is in South Korean hands now. It's all over. You are not waiting for someone who'd turn in his own wife to save himself, right? How about this? Confess that Pyo Jong-sung is a double spy. I'll take care of the rest of the story. How long do you think you'll last doing this to us without the Party's approval? Who knows? - Who knows about this place? - The person who used to use it. It's me. Have you gotten so full of yourself eating sausages everyday? What's taken so long? Those South Korean bastards are they good to you? Let Jung-hee go. We can't have a confession without a witness. After all, you've teamed up with the South Koreans guys. Let me talk to Jung-hee. Are you okay? I'm fine. Try to calm down and hang in there. For now... do what Myung-soo says. I'll come for you before long. Why are you giving her false hopes? You better watch out if you want to die in peace. I will die whenever I want to. You shut up and get over here now. Understood? Let me go, and I'll get the account for you. Hey, Pyo Jong-sung. Do I look like a nice person to you? If you don't let me go, you will never see that account. And you'll never see your wife. An innocent woman's life is in danger. We all die. She is carrying a child. It's not my child, is it? I'll defect. MR KANG: CAN'T GIVE SUPPORT ALL ACTIVITY FOR THE LAST 48 HOURS HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO US. Support might be a bit late. With the Arabs around, more people only mean more danger for the hostage. If you can take the back, I can handle this alone. And when you defect, your wife is coming South with you, right? My wife may be against defecting with me. You're honest, now that we're all the way out here. You are risking your life for a wife that may or may not come with you? If you were me, would you understand? What makes less sense to me is why you are risking your life. Because this is my job. Do you need a reason to work? You just do it. She's my wife. I don't need a reason to save my wife. Is he really coming? He's going to be a while. He won't be here till after 4:00 a.m. Standard KGB attack time, when humans are weakest. Like that. Wait any longer, and it'll be sunrise. Have you received sniper training? I was awarded leave for excellent shooting by my division commander. Position secured. Be careful. Outside... two North Koreans, two Arabs. At the center table inside, two Arabs. Center, three o'clock by the window one North Korean. The woman... is at the left end, tied to the chair. As for her status... she is fine. Hey, if you hear me, shake your head. Shake your head! Damn it. You can't kill a man like that. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Where are your South Korean friends? Would I bring in idiots to catch a fool? Keep alert and bring the girl. You tried hard to find a way out of this, huh? You didn't need to do that. Your family has enough to take over Berlin station regardless. You can't have two heads atop one body. You know hunger doesn't bother us but jealousy does. That's all the trust there is between comrade chairman and comrade Dong? Comrade chairman is a human after all. Human beings tend to betray. I'm here to be that traitor, as you wish. If you let us go, we'll live in hiding for the rest of our lives. Everything you want to hear is in there. Such an effort to live. It's an honor to hear a Republic hero confess. "Comrade Pyo Jong-sung has betrayed the Republic." I can't wait. Let's play it. Before you do... I have one question. Did you set me against my wife knowing that her hospital was near the US embassy? You said she was pregnant, right? I just threw it out there. You were the one that put it together. Protecting the innocent until proven guilty... Isn't that your specialty? I, Pyo Jong-sung of DPRK would like to take this time to confess. The Party wants to replace the Berlin branch. But right now, replacing the current officials isn't justified. You bastard! Play the rest. If we ambush the deal Yuri is into with Asim, then you will have the justified reasons to replace the current officials, right? Right. So finally, you Israelis will have Yuri and Asim. Like you've been wanting, we can hand them over. Explain yourself. What did I always tell you? You rush too much and make critical mistakes. You think you have everything. Acting like the hero of the Republic and look where you are. I'll admit you were a good teacher. ♪ Don't worry. You need to leave me to live. You don't mean that. I know how you feel. If you do, hang in there and live. It's okay. I'm on your side. This... Can you move? Kill me. Kill me now. You know that killing me won't end all. I'll go back and talk to my father about it. Let's wrap it up here. What do you say? Human beings tend to betray. Where is your hometown? Your hometown, where is it? It's okay now. Let's go. Let's go, Jung-hee. We still have... so much to talk about. Let's go. We can still make it. I'm sorry. Jung-hee... Come on. Wake up. Jung-hee. Wake up. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go home. Let's go home. What's the progress so far? We just have the last step left. It's up to him. He can come to the South or seek asylum elsewhere through UN. Good job, everyone. We'll wrap up this case here then. Anything regarding the secret account or Pyo Jong-sung should be shredded. Keep only minimal record as top secret, classified. There's a few steps left officially... Well... the President has just announced in Russia a transcontinental gas pipeline project going through Pyongyang. We already have a deal with Pyongyang. Turning over the account and Pyo Jong-sung is the last term on the agreement. Does that mean Pyo will be purged with Dong Jung-ho? Why would Dong Jung-ho be purged? He's the one that sealed the deal. You know how it works. They won't go down easily. Get out. Get out, you commie bastard! I can't stand to see a commie like you live a cushy life. Go. You couldn't protect your wife nor the child she carried. You betrayed the guy who put his life on line for you. That's who you are. You betrayed your country. You betrayed your people. That's the kind of person you'll be. Live in hiding from now on. Go unnoticed. Live like dust for the rest of your life. Don't even think about whining or taking sloppy revenge. Just live enough to breathe... like regular people. It's me. How are you? Did you think that you'd live after what you did to my son? You can't go anywhere. We are not the only ones after you. You don't need to look for me. I'll come to you. You better be here soon. You'll be on all fours begging me to kill you when you do! Flight to Boston, one way. Subtitle translation by: Charmy Park
