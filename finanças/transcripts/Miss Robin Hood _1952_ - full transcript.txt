(peaceful music) (dramatic music) (electricity sizzling) - [Girl With Braids] Cor it's hot! - Of course it is, it's burglar proof. Gosh, is it all real money Miss Hood? - I'm not sure, some of it may be government bonds. - I wonder what the night watchman's thinking. - I've never seen such a pile. - Must be thousands. - And every penny stolen from those poor widows in Albany. Come on then, pass it over. - Won't the widows be surprised getting their money back. Why don't the police put the wicked stock brokers in prison? - Darling, they couldn't do that. The honest burglars inside wouldn't like it. - And that's the lot, Miss Hood. - Come on then, quietly now. We don't want the police coming along and spoiling things. (footsteps pattering) (alarm buzzing) - He made it. - Good for the night watchman! - Come on. (alarm clock trilling) - Henry. Henry, wake up, what's the matter? - I was dreaming. Next installment. I nearly got it. - Now, come along dear. You know it's press day tomorrow. (suspenseful music) - Where are my slippers? - Up a little, up, up. (peaceful music) - Morning Sue. - Hello daddy, sleep well? - Mm-hm. - What's Miss Robin Hood going to do this week? - Oh, I've only got the beginning of an idea, something about a crooked stock broker, I don't know. - You'll get it. You always do. - I do, don't I? - Now you start your breakfast. Oh poor daddy, you can have my egg. - Oh no. - You can. I've hidden it behind here in my coat pocket. Pam, you know. Here you are mummy. - Thank you, pet. - Come on, out of it! Phew, that's the family taken care of. There you are, daddy. (peaceful music) Daddy. - Yes poppet. - You know I like to help you with your work. - Oh but you do. Any suggestions? - Well in this week's, for instance Miss Robin Hood says, "Golly it's the police." - Yes, she seems to say that every week doesn't she? - Well that part's all right. It's that just that, well, we don't say golly anymore. - Well what do you say? - Anything like crumbs or gosh. - You mean is golly is considered old fashioned? - Well, not really I suppose. Babs Henshaw says golly and she's hockey captain. - That would seem to justify it, wouldn't it? (upbeat music) - Good morning Mr. Bunyan. - Good morning. - Mr. Bunyan, I believe the chief's calling an editor's meeting. I was wondering about The Teenager. What timing? - My secretary will tell you. - And certainly. - You'll be sent for, if necessary. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - Gosh, to think of all the millions of words he's written on this. - He works too hard. I'm always afraid he's not gonna turn up. - He will. In a minute now he'll walk right in and say, well children, shall we start pounding it out? - Morning. - [Employees] Morning sir. - Well children, shall we start pounding it out? Any problems? - They have a make it feature over at Random. We had to cut Puzzle Corner. - We can't have that. I'll keep this down to 5,000 and you put it back. - Right sir. (keys clacking) - If we win if we do. - Hello Wainwright. - Hello old man, we packed up at the ninth, pouring with rain, you know. - Been to the sales, dear? - Another cover like that old boy and you'll be banned in Ella. - Oh really? - Yes. - Everybody, Lord Otterbourne. (dramatic music) - What an amusing hat. (people chattering) (keys clacking) (phone rings) - Teenager here. - If that's the meeting, I'll come down at once. - It's the commissionaire. There's a Miss Honey downstairs wanting to see. Something about an autograph. - Hm, a little fan. Well it's nice to know that somebody likes us. - Well, why shouldn't they? - I'll meet her in the main hall, lunch time. - Mr. Wrigley will see you in the main hall at lunch time. - [Woman In Hat] My time is valuable even if yours isn't. I've been here over half an hour and no one has paid the slightest attention. - [Commissionaire] It's nothin' to do with me. - But Carol Levies clearly and distinctly told me one o'clock. - Well I can't help it. You try the Chiswick Empire. - Ah, little Miss Honey. How nice of you to come and see me. I'm Mr. Wrigley. - Well wriggle off. - Thief! - Oh listen, did they get to the Teenager? - Actually no. - Oh. - But don't think there aren't going to be changes, Wrigley. - Changes? - Quite new approach. Purely visual. The author says nobody has time to read nowadays. Shrewd, you know? - Pity about him, he really can write. - Is that Mr. Wrigley of The Teenager? - Just going out now. - Thank you. - [Pearl] Good morning dear. - Morning Pearl. - Oh, has someone passed away? The bailiff's in? Lost a shillin' and found sixpence? - No, everything's fine. - Oh, that's better dear. - I'll have my usual, baby bass. - And a baby ginger ale. You don't mind buying me a ginger ale do you? - No, of course not. - I always knew you would have a nice face. - Did you? Thank you Pearl. - Your ginger ale, straight? - With a straw please. Henry Wrigley at last. I've read every word you've ever written. - Oh, I see. - That's the straw there. - Thanks, well, cheers. - Cheers. Funny how things happen. I had to meet a little girl this morning, a reader. - That was me, I'm Miss Honey. It was stupid of me to come when you're working. One shouldn't disturb a genius but I wanted your autograph. (bell dings) Ah! Here we are. Oh dear, my bird seed. (doves cooing) - Are they yours? - No, everyone's. - But pigeons in a pub. - Please don't worry, they're quite happy. - [Henry] So I see. - Just write something nice across the cover. To Heather Honey. Oh, well you know, I'm sure you've done it lots of times. (bell dings) A large brandy and soda for Mr. Wrigley and lemonade for me. - With a straw? - No straw thank you. - [Henry] There we are. - Thank you Mr. Wrigley. - Miss Honey's brought some pigeons along. - They're alive! - Have you ever tried this? - No, should I? - It has a secret recipe. - Indeed. - Stolen from my great grandfather by the Clan MacAlister in 1832. - You mean to say that it's yours by right? - Oh yes. - May I see? - Yes. - MacAlister Honeycup. A subtle blend of fine old scotch whiskeys with that little something extra that only the MacAlister can give. - He gives it the something extra once a month. - [Henry] Who? - The odious MacAlister. - Is he here too? - Oh no, at the distillery. At least he will be later on. He keeps the recipe in his safe. - Odious? - Isn't it? And once a month, he mixes up a batch of the essence. - To add to the subtle blend. - So this afternoon we are going to watch it done. - Me as well? - I'll take you another time. Mr. Wrigley and I. - But I had my cereal to finish. - That's the wheeze! It'll give you a splendid prop for Miss Robin Hood. - Oh but really I couldn't. - Come along, we mustn't keep Sidney waiting. - Sidney? - Sidney? - Come along! (quirky dramatic music) - There you are! Fly! (wings whooshing) - Mr. Wrigley! Your meat pie and your pickled egg! - Come along, (mumbles). Mr. Wrigley, meet Sidney. One of the gang. - I've been hearing about you. Very disappointing. - Oh, you'll get used to him. Sidney, behave yourself! Come along Wrigley. (suspenseful music) (triumphant music) The birds were nice, weren't they? - I thought so. - MacAlister doesn't like birds. He likes making money so that he can make more money. He goes round and round in a circle. - And you want me to watch him? - You see, Miss Robin Hood could help him a lot. She could pinch the secret recipe. - And then he wouldn't have to make Honeycup anymore. - Or be a managing director anymore. - And he could sit under the trees all day. - And watch birds and be happy. - And you'd get your recipe back. - I say, you are right. - So that's it! You think I can open safes. - Well, Miss Hood Opened two in last week's installment. Smooth worker. - But I only invent these things. - And I'm only trying to give you a plot. - I think I'll get out if you don't mind. Driver. - Please don't disturb the driver while in motion. (horn beeps) (suspenseful music) - There, isn't that horrible? - Revolting. - They're all waiting for The MacAlister. That's where the recipe's kept. - How do you know? - I've been casing this joint for months. - Whatever for? - You'll see. By the pricking of my thumbs. - Something something this way comes. (ominous music) - No one's allowed in the room of course while he's doing the mixing. - Oh. He's coming in. (wings whooshing) - Got it! - Are you trying to tell me you've got the combination? - One number a month for six months. The ingredients themselves aren't so tricky. It's the proportions that count. - He doesn't seem to have made an awful lot. - No, you see it's tremendously powerful. One teaspoon full to 1000 gallons. Yes. - Just like Jekyll and Hyde, isn't it? - Got him! - What do you mean got him? - I knew he'd make a slip one day. - I thought he did everything perfectly. - One fatal error. He's forgotten to lock the door. Mr. Wrigley, the die is cast. You're going to burgle that safe. - Good. - Oh, are you all right? Come along. - I believe you mean that. - Of course I did. I haven't studied Miss Robin Hood for nothing. - Back to the office, that's it, I should never have left it. All my page brews, I must see Bunyan at once. - Mr. Wrigley, why do you think I want to pinch the recipe? - I don't wanna know. - I have a little plan. - And I've got work to do. - Well, write about how to dodge the police. How to get away with the swag. Hi, officer. Why not jump up here. It's a lovely view! (keys clacking) - [Bunyan] All right sir, we can leave the decision 'til next week's board meeting. Good night sir. - Good night Bunyan. - Oh there is just one thing sir, if we're going over to full color on Baby's Only. - Yes, yes, in the morning, in the morning. - Yes sir but if we are going over to full color. - Bunyan, I have. - Lord Otterbourne. - Oh hello Wrigley. - Could you spare me a few moments sometime tomorrow sir? - Certainly, give me a ring in the morning. Not too early. - I understand. Good night sir. (car whirring) (footsteps tapping) (dramatic music) - Hop in quick, she needs ya. - What's happened? - I'm only OC transport. - But I'm on my way home. - Come on, your holding up me knitting. - Yes, wait. Look here. (engine rumbling) - Why didn't he ring up to say he'd be late? - Well, he never thinks of anything but that old magazine. - I do hope nothing's happened. - Oh, you know dad, nothing could. Oh, that'll be Ernest. Oh, oh Sue, you let him in will you? - Oh all right. - Oh dear, why do we have to eat in here? Don't let him near the living room. I won't be a moment. - Come in. - Oh hello Sue. Where's Pam? - She's bust a strap. - Oh, oh dear. - She won't be long. - Oh, I've finished the letter A now. - You have? - In the encyclopedia, you know. I'm sort of learning things nobody else knows about. - Oh. - Like the Abraham-men. A band of sturdy beggars who in the 16th and 17th centuries, simulating lunacy, wandered about Great Britain in a disorderly manner. - Like you? - Hello Ernest, sorry to keep you waiting. - Oh that's all right. - Don't take him away, we were just going to do letter B. - It's a nice night. - [Pam] Heavenly. - Did you know that the Ancient Greeks and Hittites used to play the bagpipes? - Oh, did they? - Yes. Nero played them too. - Honestly? - In Persia they were called reed bags. - Well, just imagine. - Hop on. - Hold this. (peaceful music) (engine rumbling) - Are you sure you'll be comfortable? - It'll be heaven. You won't be able to talk. (eerie music) - What's happening? Where is she? - You stop there. I'm gonna put the limousine around the corner. They might be watching, don't go away. - Well wait a minute! (Miss Honey whistles) - Here I am. Swag ho, catch! Bravo! Oh, thanks. - Here, you haven't? - Of course, I just used your methods. Elementary. - Oh, I won't do it here. You take it. - No, that's for you. I hope you worked out the getaway. (alarm ringing) The alarm. - The alarm! Take this. - Wrigley, come along! (whistle squeals) - According to plan? - Yes, everything going splendidly. - Oh, good. - [Miss Honey] Come on in. - You'll drop me at the nearest station. - Go on, get in. (engine rumbling) - Oi. - I know, I know, follow that cab! Tally ho! - We're being followed! - Exciting, isn't it? - They're gaining on us, do something. - Come on, step on it. - Tacks, Miss Robin Hood would use tacks. - Sure she would. Here you are. (tires screeching) - He's missed them. Sidney, turn into that mews over there, quickly. (tires screeching) We're chasing them now. - It isn't really fair is it? Make that turn. - Hold on. (tires screeching) - They're gaining again, what now? - I'll drop off at the bond site and leg it. Lose the cop in the ruins. - Well, what about me? - Just a sec. You carry on. All right Sidney. (tires screeching) - Stop, let me out, we're thieves! (tires screeching) (metal clanging) (horn beeps) - Come along, move along there, move along. - Is he all right? - What happened? - Drunk. - Who, you? - Do me a favor, him. Cut right across in front of me. Nearly swallowed my knittin', I can tell ya. (people chattering) - Dead? - Oh, he's all right, just passed out. There's another bloke in the cab though, he might be damaged. - Here, half a minute. Let's have your name and address. Ah, beg pardon milord. You all right milord? That's good. Well I shan't detain ya now I'm in order. I'll be in touch with you later milord. Milord! Don't forget your bag milord. That'd never do, would it milord. - Evening Mr. Bunyan. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (door creaks) (boxes clattering) - [Marion] Is that you, Henry? - Yes dear, I'll be up in a minute. - I say mummy, did Colonel Blood really steal the crown jewels? - As your father, he's the expert. - [Sue] Hello daddy. - About time, Henry. - I'm sorry dear. - Mummy and I thought you'd had an accident. - Accident? Oh no, no. - Mr. Reynolds came you know? He was furious about the decorating. - He said them stairs look a proper sight. Daddy, have you been wearing a disguise? - No, just an experiment. You can have it if you like. - Ooh, super! - Henry, why did you shut the door? - [Henry] I thought you were in a draft, dear. - Well now, come and eat your supper. I'm sick of the sight of it. - No marks on that safe. He knew the combination all right, huh? - And it beats me. Not a member of my staff had the faintest idea. (footsteps clacking) - PC Andrews here, confidential report. - At 7:53 this evening, my attention was drawn to an accident in Burrow Street involving a taxi cab and a private vehicle. As it appeared to me. - Oh shut up, this isn't Burrow Street. What happened, Broom? - Man in the cab gave a false name, sir. Said he was Lord Salisbury. - How do you know he wasn't? - Lady Salisbury's at home with gout. - Well the devil has that? - So Lord Salisbury is at Brighton with a friend. - Good lord, Miss Honey? - No sir, Gabriel Dorne. (upbeat music) - It's Heather Honey. There's always birdseed when she's around. - Can you identify this woman? - I've known her for years. She's a bit round the bend if you ask me. - Any motive? - She'd say so. She has a bee in her bonnet about this recipe. Says my great grandfather stole it from her family. - And did he? - I shouldn't have left the door open. - Do you know this woman's address? - It's Hampstead somewhere. Heath Square I think they call the place. - Right, I'll keep you informed, come on then. (upbeat music) (footsteps pattering) (children chattering) - Come on. (parrot screeching) - Oh come along dearie, come along. You bring her (mumbles). See if she takes from you. Now quiet, children! We're going to have school. - [Children] Hooray! - [Miss Honey] Here goes. There we are, off we go. - [Gramophone Recording] Good morning children, now have you all got your pencils and paper ready? (children laughing) There will be certain points which I shall require you to note. That's right then, now. Last week, as you will remember, we discussed the early sects and discoveries in Hertfordshire. - Miss Honey, there's somebody at the window. - Oh, indeed so there is. Well, we must let them in. Oh, how do you do everyone? Do come in. Do please come in. It's a little crowded but nevermind. Come and play schools. The children will love you. Ah, there we are. Now, what can I do for you? - I'm Inspector Wilson of O Division. - Oh, dear old O Division. - Acting on information received, it is my duty to ask you. To ask you. Certain questions. - When is a door not a door? - Where were you between the hours of seven and eight tonight? - [Children] Objection! Sustained! Overruled! - I was feeding some birds. - I thought so, where? - [Children] Objection! Sustained! Overruled! - Here and there. - Don't trifle with me madam! It won't get you anywhere. Search the house, Broom! - Where's your warrant? - Where's our warrant, Broom? - Do forgive me, I have to pay a call. - You'll answer my questions another time, madam, I assure you. - Splendid, but I must run along now. Look after the house children! And don't be too good. - Shall I trail her sir? - Oh, I wouldn't bother really. I'd only have to lose you. (phone rings) - Inspector Wilson speaking. - Oh yes, I want to speak to Miss Heather H- (fist thumping) - Well, see who it is, dear. Well, what's the matter? There's someone at the door. - Good evening Mr. Wrigley. I'd like a word with you. - Me? - I have observed a member of this household behaving in a suspicious manner. - There must be some mistake. - I've got all me evidence, Mr. Wrigley. Here you are. I couldn't resist me little joke (laughs). - Who was it dear? - The cat. (door taps) (suspenseful music) (bell dings) - Hello Mr. Wrigley. - Oh thank heavens you've come, all this money in here. - Just a sec. (Miss Honey whistles) (wings whooshing) They were cold, poor dears. They're safely home here. Come along darlings. Did you have fun? - Lots, a car crash. - Oh good, Sidney all right? - Of course. - Plenty. - The police are after me. - Lucky you were wearing a disguise. - Wasn't it? - Clever of you not to lose the swag. - I never want to see it again. - Oh but of course you do, it's all yours. - Oh no. - I took it specially. - But it's The MacAlister's. - Oh, he's got lots more just like it. You can't write when you're worried about bills and things. - Oh please, this worries me far more. - Nobody ever refused what Robin Hood took from the rich. You're spoiling things. - Oh please take it back at once. - I can't! - Why not? - The police are going to search my house tomorrow. Oh don't worry Mr. Wrigley. How about a little drinky? - You mean, to celebrate? - Yes. - Off to bed now lovey, it's late. - Just a few minutes. I've still got two pages. - I didn't know The Teenager was that good. Sue, have you noticed anything odd about Daddy? - Not half, he's going bats. - I thought it had to be mixed with whiskey. - It's more nourishing like this. - It is, isn't it? Miss Honey, forgive me for making all that fuss about the money. - Oh now please. - No, but you went to a lot of trouble to get me a little present and I've been ungrateful. - Here, drink. - Of course I can't take it. - Why ever not? - Well, I don't need it. I'm a writer. - The best in the world. - Oh no. But years ago I used to think I could write great books. - But you can. You can! You've invented a whole new world for children. A sort of kind sunshiney happy world. And funny people the children remember when they grow up. - Oh that? - Yes, the way they remember Peter Rabbit and Peter Pan and Alice. - Oh now wait a minute. I'm not as good as all that. - I think you are. - Then I'll do better, much better. You've given me back my spirit, my manhood, you fill me full of courage and. - Honeycup? - Yes. - Well now, if you really don't need the money. - Not a penny. - I do. - What? - Oh not just a little bit like this, lots of money every year. - What for? - To spend on children of course. For ice cream and barley sugar. Places all over London where they can play. Scamper grounds, parks with special park keepers. - So that's why you pinched the recipe? - Of course, it's worth oodles. I tried to tell you. - Oh that's a sensible thing to do with money. - It's only paper after all. - It's all just paper with lots of squiggles on it. - Birdseed, look! (people laughing) Yes, yes, oh let's put some in the boiler. - No, it's hot enough already. - Yes it is. That's the lot I think. Oh you pet. Well, we can spare him that one. - There's one for you. - Angels now. What about the recipe? I might get caught, you know? - Not you. Nevermind, bung it in. I'll look after this until you're ready for action. - Oh wonderful. - There you go. It's been a wonderful day! - Nice to see you so confident. Au revoir! - Au revoir! (Miss Honey whistles) (engine rumbling) (peaceful music) - What are you thinking about? - Polyandry, oh no it isn't another girl. It's, polyandry all one word. It means one woman having several husbands. It's chiefly noted in India and Tibet. - Go on. - The Eskimos do it too. But I wouldn't like it. (Henry laughing) - Oh charming. - Well who was that? - Well it sounded like daddy. - But it couldn't be, it was somebody laughing. (metal scraping) (man laughing) - What was that? - Someone laughing I think. - It couldn't be. (engine rumbling) - What's daddy doing laughing in the cellar? It frightened Ernest. - Well, I thought he went rather suddenly. - Dad really is the limit. (Henry laughing) There was Ernest, actually talking about a husbands and daddy. (Henry laughing) He's gone potty. - Hello, hello chaps. - What's the joke daddy? - Money. - Henry, what have you been up to? - I've just found out you don't need 10,000 pounds to be happy. - You need 70 pounds though, what about the new bath? - Oh plumbing, painting, income tax, slogging at the office. Nonsense, absolute nonsense. - You've been drinking. - I have indeed. - Susan, go to bed. - Oh daddy's so happy, can't I? - Susan! - She's quite right you know, daddy's very happy. - Well, it's all very well for you. - You're getting too big for your boots, go to bed at once. - Henry, if this is what you're like when you've had a few. - Good, isn't it? And it's going to be permanent. Marion, what would you say if I chucked all this? - You mean us? - No dear look. I never knew until tonight how good I was. I'm a writer, not a hack tied to a weekly deadline. - You've got a good job on The Teenager. - You didn't think so this morning and I don't know. - Henry, you wouldn't resign? - I might, I might do anything. It all depends on the Otter. But who cares? - What about locking up the cat? - You do it and be quick about it. - All right, buy it. - He still hasn't arrived sir. - Well, who? - Wrigley, sir. - Oh, oh, yes, all right, Bunyan. - Where the devil have you been? - I've been out for a walk. - Do you realize that the Otter's been waiting for you for the past hour. - Good, I bet he's had you on the hump. - Mr. Wrigley, Lord Otterbourne's furious. - Couldn't you keep him happy? - [Receptionist] Mr. Wrigley! - You're late. Can't see you now. - You can see me, you're not busy. Just a moment. I want to talk to you. - All right. Better sit down. - Where's Wrigley? - In there. - [Henry] What's this rumor I hear about The Teenager? - [Lord Otterbourne] I'm making changes, that's all. - [Henry] To my magazine? - [Lord Otterbourne] My magazine, Wrigley. - Yours? You only bought it for the paper allocation. - That's all it was worth. - How do you know? You've never ready it. - Oh, come Wrigley. Now you and I have been in this business for a long time. - Business? You think that justifies everything. What do you think you're selling, trouser buttons? - It's the same principle. - You would say that. That's what happens when anybody like you gets hold of anything. You get fatter and fatter. All you think about is balance sheets, profits, and interoffice memos. Before you've finished, you've killed the very spark that keeps the whole thing running. What do you think all this muck's built on? The work of writers, people like me. Without us, you'd be a stranded whale. - Writers, I could go out into the street and pick up a dozen like you. - So that's what they mean by the prostitution of the press. - Get the main desk. He's certainly drunk. Possibly armed. - Now what about The Teenager? - I'll tell you, exactly. I'm streamlining. It'll be a two-page supplement in color in The Youth Gazette. - And I suppose you'd like me to write the captions? - That would be nice. - Goodbye Lord Otterbourne. I'm resigning of course. It's a great relief. - You all right sir? - Shall I throw him out? - Sergeant. - [Lord Otterbourne] Goodbye Mr. Wrigley. - [Henry] Pray, excuse me. (upbeat music) - But of course Mr. Bunyan, at once. Well, that's the end of friend Wrigley. - Sacked? - Resigned. I've gotta finish his serial. - What, write that stuff? - Only for this week. I've got one or two rather charming ideas. (upbeat music) - I'm afraid it's no use Inspector. Can't you search elsewhere? - Let me have a try. Here, come on. (children chattering) - I know, the name's familiar but you can't recall the face. Hello there. - Why Mr. Wrigley! How nice of you to come. - Dear Miss Honey. I see you have visitors. - Isn't it delightful? (man groaning) (children laughing) - Come on kids, ices and lemonades all around. (kids cheering) - Shan't be long Inspector, don't bother to lock up. - Well sir, no, I couldn't be sure but I think that was the bloke in the taxi. - Will you swear of it? - Of course sir, what I meant was I'm not sure. - We better keep an eye on him. - Give the kids anything they want. - Lovely, isn't it? Isn't it fun? We're being watched. They don't worry you? - Not a bit. - Good. Then let's get along, shall we. I thought it'd better be in red somehow. More menacing. - What should? - The note of course to MacAlister. Please attend. - You're not going to write to The MacAlister? - Well, I thought you would. You're so good at it. - Are we gonna sign my name? - No, no, that'd never do. I thought anon. - What about an ill wisher? - Oh, no, no, too tame. Got it! Miss Robin Hood. - Right now, what are we going to say. - Well, we are desperate. (peaceful music) Well, come on. - Desperate. - Yes. We have the recipe. And, no, if you fail to meet our terms, it will be sold to Glencairns Whiskey. - Oh, blackmail eh? - Yes. We shall be in touch with you. Do not tell a soul. - Not even the police. - Not even the police (laughs). If you value the recipe, that's it. - Signed Miss Robin Hood. - Hood! Now fold it, pigeon post. Oh! (bell dings) Put it on the table, my dear. Another lovely journey for you. Pop it in the container. Au revoir sweetheart. Operation Honeycup (speaking in Italian). - Regardez, cried Miss Robin Hood, snatching the picture out of the safe. A genuine Salvador Dali. Note the startling minute realism. The overturn of Chirico. C-H-I-R-I-C-O, Chirico. Who, go away, together with Miro, so greatly influenced the master's earlier work. (door clicks) - [Henry] Wotcha, Ernest? - Wotcha Mr. Wrigley. Mr. Wrigley? - Yes? - There's something very important I'd like to say to you. - Anything you say is important, Ernest. - Oh no, no this is about me. - Won't it keep? - No! Oh, yes of course it will. - No problem. - Did you say something funny Ernest? - Me? - Good lord. Mother, quick! Now Ernest, wait in the kitchen. I shan't be a moment. - What is it dear? - Ernest. - Oh all right. - Look. - It's a new one. He's bought a canary. - Oh, it's all those stories of his. They've finally gone to his head. - Leave it to me dear. Don't say anything. - Oh Mr. Wrigley, I'm earning 11 pounds a week and statistics show that every man of my age. - You're doing very well Ernest, keep it up. Well, what's for supper? - Rather special. I managed to get a chop. - Oh, good (laughs)! - Oh, daddy what is the matter with you? - Please Henry, we're terribly worried. - Well, to tell you the truth, in the strictest confidence of course, I chucked up me job. - Henry! - No! - And I pinched 10,000 quid. (woman gasps) - Oh Mr. Wrigley, only yesterday the senior partner was saying to me, Ernest he said. - Oh go away. - Oh I'm so sorry. - Henry, you're joking. - Not at all. By the way where's Sue, she'd enjoy this. - Well she's stoking the boiler. (coal rattling) - Golly, good for daddy! - Now Henry dear, we know you weren't serious but. - I've never been more serious in my life. - He's done it, he's pinched thousands! Daddy, you're wonderful. - Oh, it's full of money! - Oh, is it real? - All depends on what you mean by real. As far as I'm concerned, it's just a lot of paper, look. (woman gasping) (abrupt thumping) - It's the police. - Oh dear. (paper rustling) - Oh out children, quick. Susan, upstairs. - Oh Mr. Wrigley, in addition to all that I've got an insurance policy which matures in 1980. - Pam, for heavens sake take Ernest to the pictures. - You'll have to let them in. - Are you Mrs. Wrigley? - Yes. - We're police officers. - Oh. - May we come in? - Yes, of course. - We'd like a word with your husband. - He's still at the office. - Rather late, isn't he? - Yes. - Is he always this late? - What's that got to do with you? - We're investigating a burglary at the Honeycup Distillery. - A distillery? - We have reason to believe that your husband may be able to help us. - Henry? Oh no. (suspenseful music) - Mrs. Wrigley, I suppose you realize the seriousness of this matter? You know of course that the sentence for burglary is anything from, oh, five to 15 years. What's through here? - Oh that, that's the cellar. - Where was your husband on the night of the fifth of May? - Here, as usual. - Then why is there a ring round the date? The day of the burglary? - Oh that, it's my hair dressing appointment. - I'll be back to see your husband about this matter. And if I were you. - [Police Officer] I'd advise him to be here. (suspenseful music) - Was I all right, dear? - Super, you baffled them and daddy's the best coatsman in the world. - Where are you going? - To hide the loot of course. - [Henry] I can't accept anymore responsibility. - Very well then, I'll look after the recipe but please keep the money. - We've been through all that before. - But surely, I know. We'll take it back. - To the distillery? - Of course. And now's the time! Take care of the house children. (children shouting) Come along Mr. Greatheart. - Not that way, there are four detectives out there. - Nevermind, the more the merrier. This way. There's possibly a sergeant in there. (can clangs) - There is! (whistle tweets) (engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - [Miss Honey] Look, there's Macdonald Bailey. - [Henry] Nevermind about that now. - The safe's over here. Would you like to work the combination? Good practice. - Oh for heaven's sake. (Miss Honey gasps) - So you've returned to the scene of your crime, have ya? - Delightful, we've been caught red handed. We're putting your money back. - That may get ya a couple of years off your sentence. Who's this? - Mr. Wrigley, editor of The Teenager. He's a burglary expert. - He'll get 20 years. Schultz, phone the police. - That's the number? - Now wait a minute. You've got your money back. - Steady. - And we've got the recipe. - Could we not talk this over like gentlemen? Well, we were only playing, were we not Schultz? - Let me shoot him, boss. Just in the leg. - Out you go Schultz. (man laughing) - Sit down! (jazzy upbeat music) Sit down. Now then, we've got the recipe. You know that Glencairns Whiskey would give a fortune for it, check? - Check. - Check. - So you're gonna sign over half your yearly profits to Miss Honey. - I'll be. - Or we sell the recipe to Glencairns, check? - Check. - This is ghastly, it's blackmail, you'll both of you delight for this. - You try and Sidney sells the recipe first thing in the morning. - Check. - Check. - Glencairns'll never touch it. - Why not? - I'll be crooked. - Oh (laughs). - He'll buy it. - Check. - Check. - Check. Miss Honey, you could not possibly use 50,000 pounds a year. Make it 10, you'll have less tax to pay. - Now that's unworthy of ya. The children mustn't go short. - Children? - Yes, all my schemes, not just this and that but those and the others. The step children, the union for instance, and the summer birthdays for the December born club. Then on a larger canvas, my directory of unapproved schools. My anti-psychologist centers and above all, my free speech for the groping mind platforms. - And all on my money. - Our money, we are partners now. - You got me, hey? - Like that. - And no chance of a double cross? - We'll keep a copy of the recipe just in case. - Quite right. You've done a splendid job. - Thank you. - And now what do you say to a dram of Honeycup? - Lovely (slurps). - [MacAlister And Miss Honey] It's a subtle blend of fine old scotch whiskeys with that something extra, that only MacAlister can give. - He's gone. - Oh, poor boy. He's had a tiring day. - Mummy, he's back! You're all set, daddy. - Sue's packed all you'll need, dear. - Packed, where am I going? - Algiers, the kasbah. - We thought you'd better get away. - Here's your passport. - Passport. - (gasps) the police! - Are you Mr. Wrigley, sir? - Yes. - Mr. MacAlister sir has explained the situation. Mr. MacAlister sir has explained the situation. - Good. - Sorry sir, bothering your wife. - [Henry] All right with you dear? - Why yes of course. - Oh daddy, I won't let them take you. - It's all right, dear, the Inspector's just made a silly mistake. Haven't you Inspector? - Goodnight all. (people chattering) - Everything is settled, the money is back where it belongs. Come along dear, you're tired. - I'll get you a nice cup of cocoa. - [Pam] No, let me. - [Ernest] Mr. Wrigley. - Yeah? - Mr. Wrigley, I can mend a fuse and clear a sink. - And you make 11 pounds a week and your boss likes you and Marion likes you. For some strange reason even I like you. Why don't you go and find out if Pam does (laughs). - Ernest, come here a moment. - In the living room? (peaceful music) - I haven't asked you in here before because, well, it's always so untidy. - I see what you mean. - What were you telling daddy just now? - Facts. - Encyclopedia things? - No, things about me. - What about you? - For instance, I earn 11 pounds a week. - Oh Ernest, that is a lot. - The senior partner thinks I'm rather clever. - Oh you are. - My policy matures in 1980. - Well you'll only be 55. - 54. I can mend a sink and clear a fuse. - Can you? - I'm jolly fond of children. - Oh are you? - Oh Pam I. Pam I. I love you. (dramatic music) - Looks pretty good, Sorrel. - Yes I think the kids'll learn something. (upbeat music) (kids whispering) - No talking Priscilla! - [Henry] Well, it's too bad. - We've come for our copy of The Teenager please. Right, give him the sixpence Mary Lou. Thank you, off we go. Come along girls, we mustn't keep Miss Robin Hood waiting. (kids shouting) Here we are Jacquelyn. Now let's see what she's up to this week. A few more robberies I hope. (suspenseful music) - Have you seen this? Miss Robin Hood's goin' up the pole. - Salvador Dali, kid stuff. - Look at this bit. - I know, I've just read it. - Three stitches I dropped when I read that. This bit, look. - Something dreadful must've happened to Mr. Wrigley. - Nevermind about Mr. Wrigley. What's happened to Miss Robin Hood? - She's become a filthy swot. - I want my tenner back. (kids shouting) - Good work Lidson, never thought you'd get it out. - Thank you sir. We like it too. - They're all raving about it. - They're all raving? - Have you read this? - Huh? - Well get me the last 10 issues. - Will you be in for lunch, dear? - No, I'll see you later. (phone rings) Hello? Who? - [Parrot] Hello? - All right Merna, I'll take it. Is that you Mr. Wrigley? Are you all right? Are you quite well? - Yes, quite. Oh no, I didn't write it. I resigned. - Oh but you can't! You mustn't. What'll happen to us all. Now look here Mr. Wrigley, don't worry anymore. Just leave everything to me. - Well, what's the drill? - It's that Otter. He's at the back of it all. - Otter eh? - Well sir, here he is. - They tell me you wrote this. - Yes sir. It was a rush job of course but we're all very happy about it. - And Wrigley wrote these? - Yes. - I should very much like to see Mr. Wrigley. - But he's resigned, I mean, you dismissed him. - Get Mr. Wrigley. - Yes sir. Mr. Betz, have you seen Mr. Wrigley? - [Mr. Betz] I'll find out. Miss Amber! Wrigley with you? - [Miss Amber] Mr. Jordan. Wrigley? - [Mr. Jordan] Miss Pham! - [Miss Pham] Rachel? - [Paper Employee] Mrs. Bennet (mumbles). (people shouting) - Good morning dear. I've heard. - I'll have a large scotch. - Oh it's a proper shame it is. - Hm? - As soon as I saw here, I knew there'd be trouble you know. All them birds. (drums tapping) - There. - Hey girls, Teenager meeting at the palace, 12 o'clock. (kids shouting) - Now children, you all know why I've called you together. Our beloved Miss Robin Hood is in dire peril. (kids shouting) She has fallen into enemy hands. Are we going to let that happen? - [Kids] No! - Only Mr. Wrigley can save her. On then to the Otter's den. - [Kids] Hurray! - It was her drinking ginger ale that did it. I never did like a ginger ale drinker. - Why? - Well, I mean to say, on licenses premises. - Miss Honey does things differently. - She's certainly done you all right. All them birds and no lunch and you walkin' out on a good job. - [Miss Honey] Operation Otter. (kids yelling) - Well he can't possibly get the wrong number. - Well, get the supervisor. - Lord Otterbourne's calling. - No luck. - Not yet. - Keep at it. (joyful music) - Oh the poor fellow. Have a little Honeycup, won't you? That's better, that'll do you good. There we are. On, on, son of Jesup! Straight, just good news! - No, I keep telling you. Wait a minute, have you tried the Blue Posts? - After all it was a steady job. - Too steady for an author and that's what I am. - Oh I thought you worked on a magazine. (kids cheering) - [Dennis] Mr. Wrigley, the Otter's looking for you. - Oh hello Dennis. - [Brunette Woman] He wants to see you at once. - Does he indeed? - [Dennis] Yes, Lidstone's there, he wants you back. - Sit down children, have a drink. - Look Mr. Bunyan, I found Mr. Lidstone. - It's Mr. Wrigley we want. - Come on Bunyan. We can't keep the PM waiting. - Very good sir. - And you'll have Wrigley here by the time I get back. (dramatic music) (kids shouting) - Come on you lot, out of here! - Section G, secure that man. (man muttering) (kids chattering) Now then, where's the Otter? - Oh, you can't see him. - Better come clean my man. (kids chattering) - Are we giving a school treat? - Not as far as I know. - Get them out of my way. - Who's that? - That's His Lordship. - Children, the Otter himself. (kids murmuring) No! Keep your dignity. You have your orders. - And what the devil is the meaning of all this. - [Kids] We want Mr. Wrigley! We want Mr. Wrigley! - Enough for now children. How do you do? I'm Miss Honey. Oh yes, meet Felix. There. Lord Otterbourne, I understand you run this organization. - Well, I did. You seem very interested in Mr. Wrigley. Is that why you've come here? - Yes, why did you let him go? - Are you all readers of The Teenager? - [Kids] We are! - And you've taken the trouble to come here and tell me? - Oh, it was no trouble. - Down with Dali! - Splendid eh Bunyan? - Yes indeed. - This makes publishing worthwhile. Do you need Mr. Bunyan? - No, I think not. - Go and see the prime minister for me. - Girls! (kids giggling) - Now you go right over there this minute and tell His Lordship that you're sorry. And I'll keep ya a nice piece of pigeon for your lunch. - They're back. - [Kids] Bring back Mr. Wrigley. - You think he writes well? - Oh, what a question. - Here is Mr. Wrigley. (kids cheering) You're just in time, Wrigley. I was nearly lynched. - Don't speak too soon. - So you've been at it again. - Yes. Lovely, isn't it? Well, Lord Otterbourne? - Wrigley, I've been reading The Teenager. I would like you to withdraw your resignation. - Thank you, thank you everyone. (kids cheering) But I'm not coming back. - Oh, but Mr. Wrigley, Miss Robin Hood. - But I've got books to write. Miss Robin Hood, she's finished. (children chattering) - Mr. Wrigley, Conan Doyle wrote scores of books. The ones he thought important are dead and gone but what will he always be remembered for? "Sherlock Holmes". - And he'd never have caught Miss Hood. - And you think that my stories are? - Miss Robin Hood will live just as long. - Well. - Eight more pages. Full color. - You don't have to say any more. You are going to come back, aren't you Mr. Wrigley? (kids cheering) (joyful music) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music)
