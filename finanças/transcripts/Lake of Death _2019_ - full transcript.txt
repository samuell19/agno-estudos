Do you think there's an alternate person in people's reflections? What do you mean? Like Peter Pan's shadow? Thanks. I know that I just got here, but I have to leave again. I have made up my mind. Kai and me... We will be leaving now. You will always be my brother. ONE YEAR LATER I'm sitting in a train compartment, on my way to the cabin. Together with Sonja. And Harald. Your names are Sonja and Harald, like the Norwegian Royal couple. A comment? It feels great. I have no further comment. Are you thinking about your brother? We haven't seen you all year. Where have you been? I've been at swimming competitions. And I met this guy. - I can't remember your name. - Harald. We haven't seen each other in ages and you bring another Danish guy? - Where are you from? - Ngrrebro. And you? I'm originally from Fredriksberg. My father is a diplomat and we moved here when I was 12. To this crazy gang. What kind of theories are you brewing up now, Bernhard? - Research. - For what? It's for the para-podcast. I'm doing an episode about Norwegian folklore, covering wood nymphs and water spirits. You're trying to convince us that the lake monster exists? If you start arguing about existential bullshit, I'll cut my other Achilles tendon too. - Misery style? - Bring on the Sledgehammer. - Does it hurt? - No, but I can't compete anymore. I've got a psychology degree now, so if you need to, you can talk to me. - Is she okay? - Yes, I convinced her to come up here. It'll give her Closure. It's a while since she had one of her episodes. - What happened to her brother? - Twin brother. Bjgrn went for a walk in the woods, as he did every year. But this time, he didn't come back. They searched the forest for weeks, but they never found him. He left a letter, so we don't really know Lillian doesn't talk about it. Hi. Lillian and Bjgrn are... were orphans and that house was all they had. And now she's selling it? One last trip to the cabin will do us good. Totto, come! Hi. - Harald. - Kai. Hi. - Bernhard. - Kai. Do we have time to buy a few things in town before we go? In town? No convenience store at the train station? No, the station is Closed down so there's nothing there. "All that was found were videos they recorded before they disappeared..." - How far are we going? - Far. - You've been here before? - Lots of times. I'm so sweaty I think I'll go for a swim later. Me too. Totto. Totto. What's the matter? Coming for a swim? The water is great. It's at least 85 degrees. But the water's ice cold when you go deeper. How deep is the lake? Nobody knows. They say it is bottomless. It's beautiful. There is something called Stendhal syndrome: It's when you are so moved by a piece of art that you lose touch with reality. I wonder if that goes for nature too. It almost makes my head spin. Hi. Kai. Great! Can I ask you some questions for my podcast? - Your podcast? - Yes. - What kind of podcast? - Just a thing I'm doing. Gabriel is a huge fan, he has all the episodes. Is it okay? Sure I've heard that this lake is something special. That it is haunted, you mean? I don't know I heard that someone went totally crazy here, or something like that... Yes. Gruvik. Right. Go on? He lived in a cabin here in the 1920. With his wife and their son. He was a war veteran. Allegedly, he was bewitched by the lake. In the end, he just sat here watching it all day. Never left it. - What happened? - His wife got tired of that boring, old man. She found herself a young lover in these woods. When Gruvik found out, he allegedly out his wife's throat. And her lover's throat as well. He rowed his beat out to the middle of this lake. He tied stones to his feet... Jumped into the lake and drowned himself. What happened to his son? Good question. I don't know. Is Gruvik's cabin still here? It probably is one of the cabins in this area. I don't know. Like I said: It's just a story. "Little did they know they were spending the weekend in the cabin of evil!" It is quite interesting how these myths come about. Through the years, people associated the lake with death, illness, accidents. When people didn't have medicine, it wasn't economically possible or hygienic to keep sick children alive. 80 their parents just drowned them. And then there was a myth that those who sank to the bottom would live forever. Supposedly, they used to whistle to lure the Children into the boat. This is Werner cabin. Can anybody hear me? Over. This is Werner cabin. Can anybody hear me? Over. It has been a long time. How are you? Fine. I have something. This is yours. This isn't mine. It belonged to Bjgrn. Thanks. Was it a mistake to come back here? A mistake? I don't know. I've waited a year to see you again. And now you'll just disappear again? After what happened to Bjgrn, you and I couldn't go... So we're just giving up on us? It wasn't your fault, Lillian, you have to believe that. The Werner cabin, over. How can I help you? This is the Werner cabin. We're just testing the equipment. I read you loud and Clear. Over. Thanks for helping out. There were some burglaries in the area not long ago. Nothing too dangerous. But, just so you know. Aren't you staying? I have to leave. But I'll be back. When? In three days. Is that okay? Can you manage? I have missed you. Hello? Lillian. Lillian. Lillian. - What are you doing? - I just found her like this. Oh no, not again? - Never wake a Sleepwalker. - Why not? If she's dreaming she's getting killed, she might die for real. I wasn't that scared... Hi. Good morning. Look at this! Not bad! Good morning. Sleep well? - Did you make breakfast? - No. - Has anyone seen Totto? - No. Good morning. What's up? - You didn't go for a swim? - No. I just got up. Why is there dirt on the floor? You didn't get up, set the table and go back to bed? - No. - 80, who set the table then? Who's sitting there? I'm not eating another bite until I know who set the table. Chips for breakfast? Right... But Who did it? You were sleepwalking last night. I put you back to bed. I didn't want to worry you. - Just kidding, I'm alright. - What is wrong with you?! - Just trying to lighten the mood. - That's supposed to be funny? Bernhard, that's not cool. Lillian must have... So Lillian made breakfast in her sleep? Or maybe you're all putting me on. Or maybe this is your doing, a stunt for your podcast? I have some integrity. I wouldn't fabricate anything. People do strange things in their sleep. Eat. You're alright, love? You have something on your forehead. What is it? Ink. Did someone draw a penis there? Someone wrote "dau" there. "Dau"? It's a Norwegian word for "dead". Creepy! Could you hand me the juice? Did you guys pull some pranks without telling me last night? You're not old enough to know. Hi... Do you remember us up here? Don't pay attention to Bernhard. It's just his way of dealing with difficult situations. I know it's painful for you, but you've got to let it goÂ». Do you need to talk? Maybe... You know that I only came on this trip for you. Figured out what you're going to do this autumn? Now you can't compete as a swimmer anymore. I don't know I can live anywhere, you know. - Oh yeah! - Just say the word. We can talk about it... If you can catch me! Fresh water shark! - Stop it! - I'm not doing anything. - That tickles! - I'm not doing anything. I'm not doing anything. Help! Harald! Where is everyone? What's going on? He was dragged under water in the lake. Get some blankets! I'm calling an ambulance. Are you okay? What happened? What happened? I was dragged under... - By what? - I was just dragged under. What did it? Did you see anything? A pike. It could have been a pike. A pike can be five feet long and weigh 45 pounds. One of us got grabbed by a pike once at scout camp. There was blood everywhere. But he turned out okay, he just... You got a cramp. It hurts like hell and feels like something pulls you down. - It's completely normal. - It didn't feel like a cramp. Let's get you to bed. - We can Clean up here. - Get that rug out of the way. He vomited on it. What's that? A basement? - A basement? - I don't know... You've got it? Just totally like in "Evil Dead"! Bernhard, there is a thing called sensitivity. Maybe it's an old wine cellar. I might find something Classy... - You don't like wine. - I like to be Classy. He'll break his neck down there. We just found a basement in the house where we are staying. Here's a creepy dollhouse, where mental doll patients lived... That fought and scratched themselves bloody, so that their nails came off, while they were dragged from room to room. Hey! Who turned off...? That sure wasn't Gruvik. We've just found a basement in the cabin we're staying at. Here's a creepy old-fashioned painting of a Child we can put on some wall. An old, creepy doll covered in cobwebs. You never knew there was a basement? Never. An old saw. Probably used for amputations before people got better equipment. Little shoe expanders for little Children who grew big feet when they mutated after a nuclear attack. An old dresser. A book. 3-11 - Did I say anything that... - I don't know. Everything is okay with Harald now. When I was a lifeguard, I saw it all the time. People panic in the water. It's totally normal. I knew I shouldn't have come here. Are you afraid that it will start again? It already has. When Bjgrn and I were little, we were at an orphanage for a long time. I never told anyone that only I was the one who got foster parents. I went with them. I left Bjgrn behind. I was so little and I just wanted to get away from that place. So I left. All I could hear, was Bjgrn crying. I heard it all the time. So I had to go back. When I came back, he had stopped talking. And I started sleepwalking. Since that day, I hated him a little bit. And now he is gone and it's my fault. Come here... - Holy shit... 80 you found her? - Right. In one way or another, we have to... Here she comes. You don't know how to swim, you could have drowned! One of us needs to stay up at night. Sweetie, this could have been really dangerous. I can take the first night. So you can knock on the walls and fiddle with the lights? No, thanks. - I've heard about cabin fever, but... - Now that you mention "Cabin Fever"... Let's look him in before he starts puking blood on everyone. Harald. Are you alright? What are you looking at? Totto... Totto! Hi... Easy now, Totto. He's alright. Someone just tied him up, he's not hurt. He's okay. What's happening? - Where have you been? - What? - Why did you come now? - What do you mean? - I was in the house! - Why did you come now? Hey, guys... We have to call the police. Piece of shit! I can't find my phone. Me neither. - Harald! - Mine's gone too. All our phones are gone. The radio. Someone smashed the radio with an axe. Can we please get away from here? We are far away from Civilization, we can't just walk out of here. Exactly, it is way too far. But there's no reason to panic. What do you do when you sleepwalk? What do you mean? What do you do when you sleepwalk? I'm talking now. Are you saying that I hurt my own dog? That's not possible. She's been on sleeping pills all night. Was I? What was I supposed to do? I just wanted you to get some sleep. Sleeping pills and craziness are a great combo. - Seriously?! - It runs in the family, right? You and your brother... - Answer me, you witch! - Harald, calm down! I didn't do anything. I didn't do it. - I think you did it. - I did it? You are so fucked! Harald, cut it out, okay?! Fucking witch. I called her a witch. Take it easy now. Why do you keep accusing Lillian? Where were you all the time? I'm not allowed to sleep? You knock on the walls and hurt the dog to make us believe the place is haunted? You're sure we won't find our phones in your room, then? You two - calm down. Someone with a sick mind is trying to frighten us. That's what they are trying to do. Kai said there were break-ins in this area this spring. Maybe they started their game here. The table was set for one too many for breakfast. Maybe Bjgrn got mixed up in something. So what the hell do we do? I'm not going out into the forest alone. We search the cabin to make sure nobody is hiding here. Okay? Okay. When will Kai be here? Tomorrow. Kai comes tomorrow. Salt everywhere where the ghosts might be. If the salt Changes color, it has drawn something to it, and can be thrown out. There are no ghosts of dead people. When a person dies, the soul doesn't walk restlessly around the earth. Why would anyone scare other people after they're dead? It makes no sense. I'm not talking about ghosts in white floating around here. There are scientific theories around certain energies that can gather. Gruvik might be that kind of energy. First, he took Bjgrn. We're next... What book is that? It's Bjgrn's diary. - What?! - I found it in the basement. - And you didn't tell us?! - I thought I mentioned it "Monday June 4th." "I Just sat here and looked at the lake the entire day. It's as if the lake looks back at me." Almost all the pages are filled with strange drawings he did. The handwriting and the language Changes completely towards the end. The last page is missing. It's been torn out. You have to be more sensitive. Lillian feels like it's her fault. That if she had been here, then... Listen to this. It is Kai, down at the quay. When Gruvik found out, he allegedly cut his wife's throat. And her lover's throat as well. He rowed his boat out to the middle of this lake. He tied stones to his feet... This is done by people, Bernhard. This is just a prank. What if there is something up with the lake and that's why Bjgrn... why we... Aren't you embarrassed to be falling for a set-up? The ones who did that to Totto should be punished by the law. Am I the only one who is freaked out by this? Someone did this to Bjgrn. He got involved with something he should have stayed out of. We won't relieve criminals of their guilt just because you're fond of supernatural theories. Couldn't it be one of us? We all need to take it easy and stop drinking. It only makes it worse. Tomorrow, we'll figure this out and then we will leave. Just keep it together one final night. You're always so over-the-top friendly and nice to everyone. But you're sitting there with your head full of sick things... What right do you have to say that?! - What do you see in this guy? - Could you please out it out! You're freaking me out. We have one night left here. - So please behave! - Sure. I can't believe it! Fine! - Let's get wasted, then. - Go ahead. Do you want to go down to the basement again? There you go, Bernhard. Hello? - I thought I was alone. - They all went to bed. Don't be afraid to go to sleep. What do you mean? I think this has been too much for you. Right? I will always look after you. Clown! What are you doing? I think I fell asleep on the floor, or maybe... Good night, Lillian. - Want to try it on? - No. - I have the night watch tonight? - Yes. Fine. Gruvik! Hello? Lillian, is that you? Harald! We have to get back to the cabin before Kai arrives. He should have been here a long time ago. Something is wrong. Do you think he has something to do with it? It has to be Harald. How long has he known Sonja? - Do you know? - No... Harald! Harald! Harald? He wouldn't leave me. Harald? Gruvik had a son, didn't he? Yes. If someone is trying to scare us, it's working. Where the hell is Kai?! What the hell is that doing there? - Is there someone inside? - No. Come on. Look for the keys. They're soaking wet. What did I say? Here. It won't start. - What? - Nothing. We have to fix this. Shit! Locks like the wires snapped... Or were they cut? Bernhard, hold these two Wires together and I'll try to start it. I don't know... Maybe we should go back now. Just hold the wires together, SO we can get going. The car is stuck there. And the girls are alone in the cabin. Just give me five minutes! This is our chance to get away. You fix the car, I'll warn the girls. They're all alone in the cabin. Harald! Harald! No! Sonjal. Come on, Sonja! Hello? - Put away those knives. - We have to defend ourselves! Put away those knives. Come here. Breathe. Where is Gabriel? We found Kai's car in the forest. All our phones were in the car. I saw blood in Kai's car. Gabriel behaved very strange, so I just ran away. We won't get away from here. - We won't get away. - You'll be alright. No. Not when I'm sleepwalking. Not when I'm asleep. - Or when I go for a swim. It's my fault! - Gabriel insisted that we come here! He's been playing us the whole time. He had some problems after you guys broke up, but he's been doing fine for a while now. You can't lose it now! We need you. Look at me. Look at me. We are not going to end up like Harald. I know what we have to do. Sonia, we'll go get that car started and make sure Lillian doesn't sleepwalk. Lillian? Why are you tied up? So that I won't sleepwalk. Where are the others? - In the living room. - No, they're not. They're sleeping on the couch. I looked there. They're in the basement. They have hidden in the basement. We have to find them. Gabriel, look! Lillian, open the door! Lillian, open the damned door! What's going on with you all?! - We found Kai's car and... - I know what you have done. What? Gabriel, you are sick. What are you talking about? You're sick... Please open the door. I love you. Gabriel? Gabriel? Gabriel? Bjgrn... Bjgrn! It's over now. I'll take care of you. What if he lived up here all alone. In that basement. It must have made him crazy. It will always be you and me. No, Bjgrn, I don't want to swim. Let go. Don't do it! Don't do it. You have to let me go.
