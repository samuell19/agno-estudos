Long time no see, everyone! Without further ado-- Let's toast to the success of Cafe Zero 2, my new restaurant! - Cheers! - Cheers! Who would have guessed that Tamaki had such a flair for business? The place being named what it is, I was wondering what he was doing. Yeah, really. Hmm, what could the matter be? Does he need changing? There's some open space on the second floor. That's all right. He's just a little cranky. Aren't you? Oh, okay. In that case... Ohgi... Yes? Why did you step down as prime minister? Was your apathy-- This guy here is just fainthearted, you see! A small-timer! He's not cut out for that sort of thing! What is he doing? Isn't this nice? It's because we're at peace that we could get so many of us together like it was nothing. Mm-hmm. It is the second year of the Kowa Era. A year has passed since the treacherous Emperor Lelouch was killed by Zero. The world was celebrating an unprecedented peace, centered around the reorganized United Federation of Nations. This year would come to be known in later years as the "Miraculous Tomorrow," a time in human history with neither war nor terrorism. However, if conflict is one of the fundamental essences of humanity, it is safe to say that those days would inevitably come to an end. Very well. I will consult with the legislature to see if the refugees can be taken in by the Principality of Britannia. However, right now, I have no authority to make governmental decisions. I will try to accommodate them as quickly as possible, It's me. Who are the approaching Knightmare Frames attached to? Terrorists! Get the honorary consultant inside! Hurry! You can't! This is strictly ceremonial! It's unarmed! The float system is disconnected! This is the only unit that can move out right now. I'm just going to buy some time. - What is this? - This is supposed to be a demilitarized zone! They're breaking a whole year of continuous peace. The peace that Lelouch left us! There may be a lot of noise, but I can take them! Zero is something special, all right. Just as big sister prophesied. Zero, one other unit approaching, but we have no corresponding data on it. Got it. I'll capture it and-- If only I had a sandboard... Ha! Just as big sister prophesied! What is this doing here?! Oh, no! I don't have enough thrust! This is an emergency bulletin. While inspecting a refugee camp, Nunnally vi Britannia, the honorary consultant for WHA, the World Humanitarian Agency, along with the chief adviser for the Black Knights... Yeah, it's been over a year since Jeremiah took us in, hasn't it? I want to thank you for what you did back then, Shirley. You were the only one able to move freely about. It's just... Oh, you heard about that from Anya. There's a gateway left that Charles hasn't touched. I think I'll go and check it out. Why does this world lead me on and then shake me off? Why does the world harrow up my heart again and again? I'm asking you the obvious I want to feel the warmth of asking the hard questions How do I keep moving forward over ice that is easily shattered? There you were, staring at the loose threads of my love and the scars that I had hidden But please, don't take my pain away from me I, Milly Ashford, am currently in the kingdom of Zilkhstan, which is well known for being a nation of warriors. It has been an impregnable kingdom, which has repelled all invasions by larger powers ever since its founding. The soldiers of Zilkhstan are well favored for their skills, and have served as mercenaries all over the world. Ninety percent of the nation's territory is barren land, and with few resources, it is no exaggeration to say that the nation's major export is soldiers--their military might. The captain of the Zilkhstani royal guard has just returned. I will ask him for a word. Is this a good idea? It does call for a public statement. Regarding the so-called "Puzzlement in Hashvess" that occurred at the Hashvess refugee camp earlier, can you comment on the missing World Humanitarian Agency workers, including Honorary Consultant Nunnally? Unfortunately, I have no new information. There are five countries, including Zilkhstan, which have disputed borders in that area, so the search is not making much headway, much to our dismay, as well. The loss of Miss Nunnally, who has made such a tremendous contribution to the postwar international peace is a loss for all mankind as we look to the future. It greatly pains our divine, as well. There, all done. Would you spread out the sofreh, Lelouch? You did it before, remember? Okay, Lelouch. I'm sure you're hungry, right? You can eat whatever you like. Hold on! Calm down! It's all right! Take it easy. There's nothing here to be afraid of. Nothing that can hurt you. I know. I'll make you some warm milk. With lots of honey in it. If it's not here, either... It doesn't look as though they've found Lelouch, but still... The targets have noticed us. They're dirty, all right. I'm begging you, don't drag us into this. Huh?! Aren't you...? Kallen? You're as rough as ever, in more ways than one. C.C., what are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. What are you doing here, of all places? It has been too long, Miss C.C. Well, you see, we're here because Prince Schneizel asked us to go find the abducted Nunnally and Zero. He said this country seemed to be the most likely. If he came out and accused them directly, there'd be a diplomatic dispute over not having any proof. But now... Yes. Since they tried to eliminate us, something appears to be up. Miss C.C., have you seen the news? Oh, no, I'm here-- If you're a tourist, you're out of luck. You men stand down. Huh? Are you in charge here? Isn't this attraction a bit too hard on the tourists? I thought it was just right for you United Federation of Nations dogs. Heh, then why don't we settle this question one-on-one? No. I'm no knight or samurai, you see. Huh? What is this? Miss Kallen? What is it? When did you get there?! You can't escape! Miss Kallen! What has come over you?! Having our adversaries destroy each other is fitting. How many brothers do you have?! Don't tell me... Let me go, you...! I knew it. Geass. Ho, you know about Geass? I'll have to check into your backgrounds. You! But you should... ...be dead, is that it? Huh? So that's it. A Geass that allows you to switch recognition of an individual. Quite a modest little power, isn't it? Oh, it's plenty useful on the battlefield. Hey, give me a hand, you two. I want to capture this Geass user. Very well. What? My Geass didn't work? It couldn't be...! You picked on the wrong girl. I see. Forgive us for having treated you, a former master, as we did. We'll be back later. They're from one of the splinter factions. C.C., were they from your-- I am no longer with the Order. V.V. is gone now, and it's unclear who has the authority-- We can talk later. Miss C.C., I apologize for bringing you into this, but right now-- I get it. But... What? There's someone with me. Then I hate to say this, but they have to leave with us. Yeah, you're right. If the police were to find him, it would pose a problem. You there, please come with us. Um, we need to get going. Master Lelouch? Huh? It's all right, Lelouch! It's all right! Huh? Is it really...? Well, you see... this is Lelouch... and yet not Lelouch. This is the service center. The source of the problem was as we expected. We'd like to salvage two parts for it, so we need to request your assistance. Also, we've managed to acquire a new customer, and we may need the requiem sheet music. If you please. It's possible that Lelouch once inherited a Code from Charles. The one that gives him immortality? Yes. But Lelouch used his Geass afterward, as well. What happened when he performed it without the Code issue being resolved was the Zero Requiem. And Shirley got involved after that? Yeah. She is a private citizen, unwatched by any side. I had her bring his body to the place Jeremiah lined up without drawing any attention. After that, I tried to reconstruct Lelouch in Cs' World. Reconstruct? The reason I can't die is because I replace any defective body parts with those constructed in Cs' World. Like a mirror backup, huh? Not exactly, but in a general sense, you can think of it that way. The problem is, Lelouch killed God in Cs' World. Because of that, I can no longer freely enter Cs' World. But you just came back to life earlier, didn't you? Yeah. There are probably some parts still left over. In any case, Lelouch's mind has gone missing. Then, who is this person? The empty vessel of Lelouch's body. The sorrowful ruin of what he once was. C.C.! Is this what Lelouch wanted?! I still have a promise in place with him. And so you just went ahead and...?! I know. And I won't leave him like this forever. That's the reason why I came here. You saw those assassins last night, right? They used Geass. There's an organization here in Zilkhstan, separate from the Geass Order, called Farlaf. If I use the Aramu Gate, an access system into Cs' World, which they control, then there's a chance. I'm terribly sorry, but those United Federation of Nations dogs gave us the slip. I realize someone got in the way, but this isn't like you, Qujappat. She is who she is, after all. A former master? Yes. Master V.V.'s predecessor. C.C.? Is her arrival at this time a revelation, or is it an offering? Regardless of whether the intruders are Federation spies or are connected with Geass, there are only two conceivable objectives the enemy may have. This temple, in which you sit, Princess... ...and the Wailing Prison, located on the Gimsula Plains. Mm-hmm. The hostages are there. If the United Federation of Nations finds any evidence, the whole region is at risk of an air strike. That's it. The old Aramu Gate is inside the Wailing Prison. Where's my brother? Where is Shalio? Still at the prison. Probably with him, as usual. Tell him to return at once. You go to the prison, Shesthaal, to take his place. Namjala latak. I, Shesthaal, son of the great Forgnar, will show the United Federation of Nations my fighting genes. Tell me, can you see, Zero? Or rather, Suzaku Kururugi? These are the moves you showed off time and again in Asia and the E.U. What was your attitude control at these times? These moves aren't in the programming, are they? And why is it that when you were using the Albion, your movement changed midway through? It wasn't the design, was it? What about you? How did you know what moves I would make? How did you set a trap in the place I would back into? Was it Geass? That again? I wish you would finish answering my questions. Don't forget that we have Nunnally. You're more despicable than I thought. Yeah, I am. I will do anything it takes to be the world's greatest warrior. I need pure strength to protect the ones who are dear to me. Unadulterated guile, and sheer perfidy, such as your own. You wouldn't choose death except to protect someone. That's all the data we've figured out so far. Now, tell me! Do it to protect Nunnally! Suzaku Kururugi, all of your strength shall be mine. Your Majesty... Big sister? Yes. Oh well, then. Once you have all the data saved, return to the castle. Namjala latak. Is something wrong? Oh, there are more of those lately. Yes, the energy packs have been falling short. General Forgnar is reaching out to Indonesia, but everyone is too busy rebuilding their own lands. It all comes down to national strength. We have to make sure this succeeds. Including big sister's current plan. Are they gone? Yeah. Even if they get suspicious and come back, we'll be inside the prison by then. Thanks for coming along to carry all this stuff. You're not going to tell us you didn't have a plan, are you? Well, sure. I was fixing up something that didn't involve wearing these outfits. Does this Aramu Gate really exist out here? It used to be a temple. Looks like it's a prison now, though. For bandits and ideological offenders and such. Dr. Lloyd, we're about to go inside. If we can access this Cs' World place from in here, Lelouch will come back to us, right? I'm just saying there's a possibility. Aw, man... I can't help but consider what happens if it doesn't work. We still have a glimmer of hope. That's enough for now. Ideological criminals and terrorists. Hmm? The lower block? Keep this to yourself, please. They caused the Order a lot of trouble and will be executed within a week. What's with him? Don't worry about him. Apparently, he's done too many drugs. Hey, fresh meat! What are you guys in for? Women! Women! Hey, let's have some fun! Is that a guy in the middle?! Let's party! Let's party! Dr. Lloyd, we made it below. I'd like to make our move before the strip search. How are the cameras coming? How unfortunate, it's just fine. I've already replaced it with a fake image. It's okay, everyone. Hmm? What's okay? Why, you! Thank you for showing us in. - Hey, now... - Now they've done it. Heh, idiots. Hey, you can't get out of here. It's impossible. Guards, you seeing this? Hey, this is a card-key to this place. It's yours. I'll leave it up to you what to do with it. You want us to break out, eh? Yahoo! This should be good! Yes! Let's do it! - I'm gonna kill those bastard guards! - I hope this buys us a little time. Miss C.C., is the Aramu Gate on this floor? No, it's down farther than this. It used an underground waterway, so it would be the lowest level. There would be no reason to destroy it, so I think the passage is still there. That's unfortunate. Huh? A dead end? Could that thing be the gate? It's completely submerged by the groundwater, though. Which is precisely why our chances are good-- our chances that the system is still unused and intact. I'm grateful to whoever it was that built this system. Wow. Where is all this water going? It's okay. Nothing to be afraid of. What gives? Don't stare at me like that. It's as though... Well? The water volume from the prison has increased, so the Ministry of Interior wants us to check the floodgates. Hmph, they could have just told Bitool directly. There seems to have been an emergency, and communication protocols are in effect. I know! Hmph, they appreciate groundwater more than they do Knightmare Frames. C.C., can you take Lelouch? Yeah. You keep watch over this place. Leave it to us. Miss Kallen? What is it, Sayoko? I'd like to go check on the riot and secure what we'll need for our escape. Please do. I will return shortly. Come back to us, Lelouch. Relax. We're going to put an end to you being this way this time for sure. It looks like we made it in. What's going on here? Why are people's consciousnesses just staying put? Is something the matter, Princess Shamna? No change. Is that attachment or perhaps absent longing? Longing? I beg your pardon! So that's why, Charles. The remnants of your desires and the wishes you left behind have created a barrier here. So we're going to need Nunnally after all. Damn it, men, can't you be a little more civilized about this?! How many intruders are there? The thing of it is, Warden, it looks like it's just the people we were playing prisoner for. Huh? That's not nearly enough of them. Are they plotting something? All we know is that they went to the underground floodgate. Is there anything down there? Just the temple from before we relocated here. They're planning on searching each floor by turns. All right, we'll stamp them out on the bottom floor. Less damage that way. Relay this to the big elite on the outside. You mean the honorable and proud royal guard Captain Shesthaal? You idiot, don't echo what I say. Stand by? Yes, sir. Warden Bitool said that due to the complex construction of the prison, they would deal with it themselves. That glorified bandit...! Does he think this is his own little kingdom? Sayoko, you shouldn't bring a Knightmare down here. Oh, actually, we found something that's bound to shake things up a bit. But the prisoners are free to do whatever they want, and... Oh... Yes. They were all on staff here. They were one step ahead of us. Got it. I'll buy us some time. Dr. Lloyd, you've got C.C. and Lelouch. Huh? I don't know what you expect me to do. Well, I suppose this is some rather fascinating research material. Heh-heh, this makes our day. Yeah. Lucky for us, the upstairs security didn't get them. You guys weren't here for that hunt last week, were you? Thank you so much. I love me some redheaded women! Opening fire without saying anything first? I like your style. A Ghedo Vakka! That's not good! Coming from the lower floor, huh? Nice! I hate to do this, but I have to take you out. Control Room, there's risk of a collapse! We need a rescue team! Would you guys knock it off?! Hey, do you read me, Control Room? No, are they jamming us? Man! This thing has lousy visibility! My compliments. Not bad for being in an unfamiliar machine. Why, Charles? Have you become a wedge between worlds, as a result of Lelouch killing God? Or is it something else? Lelouch! No! Over here! If we shoot any more down here...! You're right; we'll probably get buried alive! - Miss Kallen! - Over there! Over there! Don't mess with me, punk! Whoa there, that's enough. The next one is a bomb that will blow us both up. Warden Bitool, we can't contact the outside. These guys might have cut us off. Go take a quick look below you. Huh? There's nothing there. That's what bothers me! Get going! All right. Now then, what kind of fun should I have with you, Federation lady-- or no, maybe you're with the Black Knights? Lelouch! Where are you, Lelouch?! Are these souls with nowhere to go, or Refrain? Charles, stop holding on! Let Lelouch go free! No change. Tell Shesthaal to respectfully receive the master if she is there. She may be of assistance with the new gateway. Namjala latak. No! If this keeps up, his remaining consciousness will be swallowed up! Lelouch! We're getting out of here! You've finally woken up. What were you doing down here? Who are you? You should do your homework before coming into another man's castle. Ho, it is you, all right-- the woman our elite told us about. I hear you're immortal, right? You know who I am? A complete Southern Cross! Should we burn her or dissolve her next? Hey, break the arms of those other two right away. Ho, you've already started healing? Then why don't you tell me, what were you doing down here? If you don't tell me, I'll destroy these ruins. This is a dead end, is it? No, it isn't. That is incorrect. This reminds me of Narita, C.C. You got hurt trying to cover for me then, too. You may not be able to die, but you shed your blood too readily. Where did this guy come from? No way! Are you that treacherous emperor? No, you couldn't be... Ah! So that's it! These guys were hiding you here! You're in exile? No, you wouldn't be here, then, would you? Hey, I don't dislike liars like you. Well, I do dislike men like yourself, of inferior character. Oh, are you really that stupid, Last Emperor Lelouch-- provoking me while unarmed? Unarmed? Oh no, I do have a weapon. A weapon that those directly under me know all about. Lelouch vi Britannia commands you to die, right here, right now. No, if you don't want to die, you'll say you're sorry-- Namjala latak. - Namjala latak. - Namjala latak. Hey, has something happened down there? Hey! There's a lot more I have to say to you, but I'm back, C.C. Yeah. Welcome home, Lelouch. He's relegating his command? Bitool? Yes, sir. He is just the chief bandit, after all. Exactly. Huh? He senses the danger, and now he's going to distance himself from it. Ugh, we don't know what the intruders are after. Something's up. Plus, I can't use my Batalalan Du in here. It's better than messing up and getting disposed of. What do we do with the woman? I'd like to say you can have her after I've had my fun with her, but she looks good enough to be a gift to the king or the princess in the temple. Take her to the infirmary. Master Lelouch? What is it? Miss Kallen is being taken to the infirmary. Probably the facility on the fourth level. Also... What? Command of the investigation is being turned over to the royal guard. Royal guard? Yes. They appear to be standing by outside. All right. Then we're switching the mission to Zebra. Understood. Is there some internal conflict in this country? This is a move that suggests a territorial dispute. That's because it's ruled by a brother and sister. The sister presides over the religious, the brother over the military. I don't know more than that, though. For the love of... Coming up with an escape plan before breaking in is fundamental-- Excellency, I've taken over the system here. You have? Good work. Now, as for this floor, do you know what it's used for? Excellency, you noticed it, too? There's only one person left there. Under the circumstances, are they going to need to move him out, or is he too important, and they can't risk moving him carelessly? Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, Zero-- I mean, Suzaku Kururugi. I had the doctor check you out, but you shouldn't be moving around yet. As long as you're here, the enemy has to watch what moves it makes. In any case, this helps me. I'll need your help to clear all conditions. Lelouch...? Yeah. Is it really you? Go ahead and check me. You're alive? So it seems. It seems? It seems?! You make it sound like you're not involved! Yeah, I suppose I do. Did you... Did you lie to me again?! I'm not going to excuse myself. Do what you must. Do you know... what I... what everyone... had to go through?! Why did you keep it to yourself, you coward?! Why?! Why?! Stop, Suzaku! Suzaku! Lelouch wanted to stay dead, but I insisted! C.C...? I'm impressed that you were even able to move in your condition. Attention, intruders inside the facility. I am the captain of Shamna, the Divine's royal guard, Shesthaal Forgnar. This prison facility is completely surrounded. Surrender. I repeat, surrender at once. Evacuation of all prison personnel is nearly complete. If you do not contact us before they finish, then I can no longer guarantee your survival. Also, if the one who was previously within the Order comes forward, she will be treated as a guest of the state. Guest of the state? What do they want from you? Beats me. We parted ways over 300 years ago. Who knows what happened to their founders. Excellency, I built it around the Knightmare Frame simulator. Communications? See for yourself. From the perpetrators? Yes, sir. What would you like to do? Doesn't matter. Put them through. Calling the brazen Shesthaal Forgnar. Calling the brazen Shesthaal Forgnar. We are simply tourists. Remove your ridiculous cordon, and leave the area immediately. I don't mind about myself, but I insist that you take back your insult toward the Forgnar family. Ho, who knew that mercenaries could gain such honor over a scant 120 years? Why, do accept my apologies. Even thieves and bandits have their pride. If you have any smarts, leave now. If you are a fool, head right on in. All personnel, prepare for battle. We'll neutralize them from ground level on down. They're going to attack? The fools. Suzaku? I know, Lelouch. You really have come back, huh? Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't pilot that ugly Knightmare in your condition! I'm all right. I'm Zero, after all. I'm the one who has pledged to sacrifice myself for the sake of the world. That may be one of your strengths, but it's also a drawback. I know. But I don't know of any other way to undo this failure. So... My apologies. I'm going to need your assistance after all. Lelouch vi Britannia commands you! Thanks, Sayoko. I'm just glad I was in time. We have to go and guard Dr. Lloyd now. If she truly is a master, she should be able to withstand this. So... All personnel, take control of all floors quickly, in the name of Forgnar! Namjala latak. Lelouch, this strategy of yours can beat them, can't it? If you do what I told you to do. I think I know your method of operating pretty well. Hmph. Then follow your instructions. They closed off the entrance. That was expected. P-9, continue backing away. P-2 and B-4, rendezvous with R. Draw the enemy inside. All personnel, continue taking control of each floor! Madin, maintain your position. Guard the bridge-laying tank on its way here from Ablaq Base. K-1, move into action. A Ghedo Vakka? Pay it no mind. It's a decoy to let their soldiers escape. That's right. You'll think it's an enemy decoy. Ridiculous. Is this all you've got? All right, keep running the enemy down! Q Team, you have two minutes to get everything wrapped up. You're just an incompetent buffoon who's all talk. K-1, lure them in. Captain, the captured Knightmare fled down to the lower floor. Good! Press the attack! The others are sure to be there, too. Everyone knows that bandits can't beat a heroic bloodline! K-1, continue as planned. I've come for you, Zero. Zero? If you're thinking of escaping, then you must know what will happen to the other hostage. Captain Shesthaal of the royal guard, your pride is of no account. This is checkmate. No! Father!! My Sakuradite...! Kallen? Thank you, too-- Master Lelouch... What is it? Are you sure we shouldn't deal with the other staff members? Yeah. Turn them loose. The Geass I cast on them earlier ended with their cooperation. Is there something different about you? Hmm? Good question. As for what's next, we're going to cross the border at a village called Lodus-- Yeah, never mind about that. Why? Lelouch can't very well be publicly rescued, can he? Right. Besides, there's something else I have to do. Hit the enemy as hard and as fast as I can, and rescue Nunnally. Princess, this is Forgnar. I heard that King Shalio was here. Enter. King Shalio, is it true that my son, Shesthaal, has died? Yeah. We just got word from Bitool, the warden. Bitool, when did Shesthaal die? Midday. Around 11:00, I would say. We had no idea that the enemy was so formidable. I see. That makes it more than six hours, doesn't it? Big sister? My king, please give me your order. Tell me to hunt down those Federation-- those Black Knight dogs, and avenge my son! Generalissimo... Yes? Your military might is undeniable. But the enemy may have someone who possesses Geass. Princess, we are not even certain that was a master. I know! I am just saying to prepare for the worst. Yes, Highness. Forgive me. Big sister, if they do have a Geass... It's all right. Once I make my prophecy, we can beat any enemy. Just as we captured Zero? Yes. But never mind that; we have to hurry and complete things here. This is all because your brother destroyed the laws of Cs' World. By using you, whose wavelength is close to Charles, the one who failed to change things over, I will be able to transcend Cs' World. "United Federation of Nations Headquarters" Are you sure? Zilkhstan has abducted Nunnally? According to the report from Lloyd and Agent Shinozaki, yes. Hmph, I wish she'd have used me instead of the Earl of Pudding. I know the area. I want you at my side, as my technical advisor. Still, I don't get it. Why would a country that small turn the world against them, when there's no way they can win? I'm not sure if it has anything to do with that, but I received one other troubling report. Hmm? Something you can't even tell me? The thing is, it sounds like Geass is involved, as well. Does this have to do with why you called in Shanti and the others? Yes. They're the child prodigies that you brought together, so I thought it best that you tell them yourself. Sis, I sent that Frame Coat to Pudding. For the Lancelot? That unit could be seen as a symbol of tyranny. Was that wrong? I thought it would be necessary if Zero is safe. Of course it's wrong. Send in another set. Hmph, if you say so. Shanti? I thought she would say that, so I already have it ready. I hope they don't find out. We're just over the border, but still... Princess Cornelia's name is dreaded in the area. Moreover... This region makes its living by stealing and spying. And they can use Geass, too. His Excellency sure is a cautious one. We'll have to find something else for you to call him sometime. You're right. It would be bad if word gets out that he's alive. The only people who should kill are those prepared to die themselves. Which is why I am not the one who should be messing with the world. Besides, Lelouch vi Britannia is someone who abandoned his existence, along with the rest of the world. That's why, just this once, to save Suzaku and rescue Nunnally, I will become Zero again, as Lelouch Lamperouge. Well, this is strange. I wonder what's happened to C.C. Shirley! Prez! How was Zilkhstan? No good. They gave me almost no press access. Right? I'm not sure what happened, but things got dicey, so we came back. Oh, that was probably the right call. How so? There are rumors on the internet that foreigners in Zilkhstan keep getting locked up, one after the next. Huh? Ah! They say the airports could be shut down, too! I thought it sounded far-fetched, but it looks like the reports of you being alive were true, Lelouch. And you, too, Suzaku. You're on the run from your pursuers in Zilkhstan, and managed to make it all the way here to this village, right on the border. But Lelouch, I cannot allow you to enter the United Federation of Nations. Will you die here or turn back? Sister, you are mistaken. I have not fled here; I came here to join up with you. Enough of your nonsense! You are going to die again here. Just a moment, please! Are you really Zero? We've made certain. It's him, without a doubt. And just to add to that, we're witnesses, as well. Master Lelouch, we received word from Undersecretary Kannon that additional Knightmares would be arriving by air. Good. I'd like you to all work under my orders for a mission to recapture Nunnally. We believe she is being held at de Mu Base in the capital, the rock-hewn church at Mefeng, or somewhere else in the area. We want to get Nunnally back, as well. But this country has 12,000 men enlisted to defend their capital. We, on the other hand, have about 20, if you count the civilians. You can have a special team for the purpose of field surveys and advance retrieval. I can't give you more than that. Which means the enemy outnumbers us... About 600-to-1. Huh? What the hell?! Zero, we don't have enough supplies! There's no way! We're only saving Nunnally. There's no need to kill all 12,000 of them. Don't make it sound so easy. This is the country of warriors, who once defeated a Britannian army with limited numbers. What's more, this is the enemy's land. They have the geographical advantage. Our being here at all right now is dangerous. We should leave here, and try the diplomatic route. And? Do you think that will go well without me? Let me ask you again. After taking the lives of many people, including Euphie and Dalton, are you now trying to get us killed, too? All to fulfill your personal wish? Please. I need your help. I can't save Nunnally by myself. I'm going to need your help, as well. It's a selfish request. If we do offer you our help... ...then we will prevail. Are your words true? I will not lie to you anymore. I have no need to. I don't know about Lelouch, but I trust Zero. Ohgi... I once failed to trust Zero completely, and took some wrong turns. If I could do it over again, I wouldn't stray this time. I'm with Zero! I know the guy can work miracles, after all! We may not share a mother, but Nunnally is unquestionably my sister. So how do we have any other choice but to rescue her? Yes, Your Highness! Thanks. All right! So what do you say we have a party to celebrate the way forward? Yeah! - All right, you guys, bring some whiskey! - We only have canned goods for food, though. - There should be some White Fang in the #3 container. - We do have some Britannian Z-rations. Yes, sir! We're here to contribute to the effort as civilians. Jeremiah Gottwald and Anya Alstreim. It is a pleasure working with you. It is... a pleasure. Do the extra Knightmares that Kannon sent belong to you? Yes, to give support to Lelouch. Welcome. Let's give it our best. - Yeah! - Yeah! "Zero" Oh, this is just to thank them for their help. Ha! They'd sell out their country for money? It's all they can do to survive doing their own thing. There's a lot of that going around. That's right. If I achieve results here, I can go back to the center. With a huge budget and tons of power! You aren't doing this for Suzaku? Ha-ha, I'm only human. I understand. That's the kind of person you are. Cécile, you really do get Dr. Lloyd, don't you? Do I? Dr. Lloyd? Uh-oh. Did you not like the taste? I brewed it using dragon's breath chili and orange liqueur, with some starch thrown in to thicken it up. What's that smell? I added some durian for a little zest. Are you sure you don't want to talk to Lelouch? Yeah, you know, I have no idea what I'd talk to him about anymore. Best not to assume that you'll see him again tomorrow like it's nothing. Hmm? If you have anything you want to tell him, don't put it off. Well, what about you? You've lived so long, putting things off is a matter of course, isn't it? Also, this is from Lady Kaguya. In case you really were alive, she said. Is that so? You know, Ohgi, I wouldn't have thought you'd come along. A topographical map of Zilkhstan. This will be helpful. Um... Thank you, Zero. It's thanks to you that the nation of Japan is what it is now. Please accept this as my apology. Stop. All of that is in the past. I'm so glad you're all right, Kururugi. Huh? Oh... thank you. Two Zeros, huh? Just for now. What do you mean, just for now? There should only be one Zero. Such a figure already exceeds the framework of a limited world. Ah, I knew you'd be up here, Lelouch. You looked like you wanted to talk. There are two things I'd like to say. The first is that, Lelouch, now that you're back, you're the one who should be Zero. You're Zero now. I'm just window dressing. You're the one it should be. What is it with all of you? Give up on wishing me back. How can we think like that when you're right here in front of us? I'm only passing through. Huh? I don't know the rules of Cs' World. I may not still be here tomorrow. Oh, no... What was the other thing you wanted to say? Make it quick. I have to put the mission together, and I need you to recover as much strength as you can. What is it? Oh, within this data I received from Kaguya... "3" "2" "1" Ah, Ohgi's reception. Everyone got back together after being apart for so long. What a pity! You have our congratulations! And our condolences! Are you two both drunk?! I'm so sorry! Who would have called it? Ohgi and Villetta... It's a good thing for a man to settle down. I hope to attend a party you're the star of sometime. Huh? Oh, don't be silly-- Ms. Villetta, how does it feel to be living the Cinderella story? Uh... You can't ask her like that! Yeah, but come on, you could have thrown a bigger bash than this, right?! Oh, there are still-- Allow me to offer my congratulations. This is Kannon Maldini, from down at the other end of the table. Nunnally, the Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte is delicious. Ah, you think so? Don't you think it's rude not to address her as Lady Nunnally? Oh, it's all right. Just "Nunnally" is fine. Right? This is the world that you saved. Kaguya, you sneak. Lelouch, the other thing I wanted to say to you... ...is that I'm glad you're alive. Well, it was a pretty rough reunion, considering. A world without you was a lot more lonesome than I expected. Hmm. Thanks for that. Also, about Nunnally... I know. That's another reason why this rescue mission must succeed. With both of us together, there's no fight we can't win. True enough. We'll win for sure. Let me see your permit. After that, I need to check your cargo. The cargo belongs to the Black Knights. Huh? We're going to use them to blockade the capital. For the duration of this operation, you're going to be my men. What are you, a spy--?! - Namjala latak. - Namjala latak. All right, I will now explain to you your roles during the Nunnally rescue mission. You'll go into action at 00:00 hours. Uprisings will break out at four bases near the capital. There will also be radar jamming in place. The squad centered around Cornelia will use Knightmares and the like to keep the enemy off-balance. Sayoko's team will find the location where Nunnally is being held based on the enemy's movements. Understood. Suzaku and Kallen? Already in position. Is yours going to work? It's been a while, but I'll be fine. I'm more concerned about this additional armor. That's something we'll just have to use and see. What? I never thought the day would come when we'd be chatting like this. It's time. Now, make your move, whoever abducted Nunnally, you foolish mastermind. Communications with Ajbeq Base have been cut off. No response from the Ginujaya 113th Knightmare Squad. An uprising? Or is it the Black Knights? Big sister, I'll take care of defending the temple rear. Be careful. Until we know who the enemy is... It's all right. Once I'm inside my Knightmare, I can move about freely. Forgnar, you have defense of the seaward side. Yes, Majesty. Princess, are you sure we can trust this plan? Is there any other way? Namjala latak. I will come through for you with all that I have. All right, Jeremiah, in five minutes, your men will move to the gulf district and divide the enemy's number. Understood. Mr. Qujappat? Princess Shamna ordered me to join the city's guard. A national state of emergency has been declared based on sovereign defense emergency protocols. All officers and soldiers, devote every effort toward securing and maintaining command and control. The people for me, and I for the people. King Shalio, the advance force on the Gimsula Plains has been wiped out. Wiped out? You had your warning. If you're still going to keep coming... Wow. You're getting the hang of it, aren't you, Suzaku? That name belongs to a dead man. I am now... As far as I'm concerned, Zero is not just a symbol. So for you to take on that name... ...is a bit of a problem for me. Due to electrical supply stability measures, power to Category 3 and Category 4 facilities will be cut in 60 seconds. Wow, the power of Geass is incredible! We got into the ministry so easily! I need your report first. Right. Nina? Just a moment, please. Nothing especially stands out from either ground or air routes. Anya is covering the sea routes. The temple! Power and such is being prioritized to the temple! The temple? Do they think they're pulling a fast one? All right, we capture the king's sister, Shamna, in the temple, and hold her hostage. C.C., if there are any Geass users inside, you'll deal with them. Got it. Princess Shamna, it's too dangerous here! You must evacuate! There's no need. Right now, we must hurry to complete the system. Surrender, if the name Zero holds any dread for you. Impressive. Shalio thought you were the supposedly dead Suzaku Kururugi, but you're someone else? Or are there many of you? I have no intention of engaging you in conversation. My business is with Nunnally alone. If you surrender, I won't kill you. Unless you want your country destroyed, do as I say. You won't kill me? Hm-hm, surrender is out of the question. You don't wish to spare your people? I'll say it again! Surrender! I think that woman has a Geass. I don't know what her power is. I see. Six hours ago, I believe I was right in the middle of a bath. Damn you! My country's warriors would never lose in a fair fight. I'll see you later. Once again, my life has been reset by six hours. What is it, big sister? Just a moment, okay? Connect me with Forgnar. You've received another prophecy? Yes. Princess? This is Forgnar. Listen to me closely. In six hours--no, a little before that-- there will be an uprising. An uprising? There will be Black Knight Knightmares involved, so it may be some kind of ploy. I will give you more details later. First, have the alert level raised. Namjala latak. All will be as you prophesy. Zero, even if you have the master on your side, you can never beat me. I, Shamna, am destined to relive my life every time I die. No matter what move you make, my layers of experience will rebuild Zilkhstan. Big sister? Shalio, the fact that I am of no help to our nation and that I must depend upon you, is something I cannot abide. You really don't have to worry about me. No, the world is wrong. With the power of my prophecies, I will correct the world. Enemy armed forces in Majbeq Station 2 have been eradicated. Dissidents at Radar Site 3 have been pacified. Leave it to big sister's prophecy. But will the fleeing Zero really show up? Princess, should we issue an emergency alert? To make it look like the enemy's plot is going better than it is. And uncover the remaining enemies? Yes. An emergency alert has just been issued. Please remain indoors. Repeat, an emergency alert has been issued... What?! It can't be! Our lord's plan... ...has been anticipated?! Yeah! They're lying in wait for us all over! What do we do, Zero?! We never should have come here! The plan has been revealed! But how?! Hey, the entire area around the temple has been declared off-limits! Oh, Excellency... What?! You see... Our facility has been put on lockdown. Who did this? My entire plan has been seen through. This country may have tacticians and politicians, but no one this resourceful. Oh, no! The two I used as a diversion in place of a gun battery! Having nothing to do until mission time is-- Ha-ha-ha, they really were here! The fools! If they want to take me on in my Batalalan Du, then... Kallen! Get some distance! I'll use my PNC-- It's him... All you have to do is get in close enough on a long-range Knight Gigafortress. But in this case...! Why, you... I caught you! And now... Megistos Omega! This is bad! The weight of this thing is working against me! Suzaku! Come in! Kallen! Oh! Could this be E.C.M.? What do we do? We have to retrieve the data, at least. Let's get out of here. If Zero's strategy has been anticipated, then fleeing by air would be that much more dangerous, right? Hmm... Princess, I will return to our leader, then. Mm-hmm. Tell him that we're on our way to charge the castle and create a disturbance. Princess! They knew about this operation?! Ho, is that unit the "Witch of Britannia"? Bolvona Forgnar, the Brown Bulwark himself. Too slow. S-Sayoko... wait up... Ow... my knee...! Ah, they're here! I cannot reach Master Zero. The rest of you, please run down the shoreline and cross the border. I'm afraid I can't have that. Terrorists are to be crucified. By the way, do you know who are your allies and who are your enemies? Miss Cécile? Miss Cécile! Huh? I'm all right. I can start the Knightmare... This situation...! Reports say that the terrorists' command unit has been brought down. Very well. Did I manage to make it in time? Yeah. Thanks, Anya. Good. Jerry would be mad if anything happened. Hey, can you get the hatch opened? Hurry and switch over to mine. I thought I told you to stay along the border. Why is the Gekkoei-- Circumstances have changed, so it was necessary. Sure, it's not quite finished and meant to be covert, so its uses are limited-- Who the hell could have so completely seen through my plan? Should we gather intel on them? Or should we pull back first? That would hang Suzaku, Kallen, Cornelia, and the others out to dry. I know! Come up with a plan, Lelouch. That is, if you want to get Nunnally back. It's in motion... The system that had come to a halt after the changeover... Nunnally, because of you, I can once again enter Cs' World. Now, where is it? The source, the provenance, the origin of man's consciousness! Make me the first human, and let us start fresh! Let me bring Zilkhstan, Shalio, and our many people back into this world in the form that I desire-- Princess Shamna? You appear to have gone quite deep. Are you all right? I can do it. Huh? I'm almost there. What are the terrorists doing? We received word from Generalissimo Forgnar that they were all subdued. King Shalio does not appear to have had any trouble, either. I see. A readjustment, please. At this point, I don't mind if Nunnally dies. - Namjala latak. - Namjala latak. So Nunnally is in the temple after all. But then... Hey, hurry up with your next orders. Orders? In the mess we're in?! Huh? Even if I wanted to change the mission, radio communications are shut down. Further, even if they knew about my Geass, it's impossible for them to have known what our forces and plans were! How am I supposed to fight an opponent like that?! I can't keep up. Needle marking... on both arms is out. The people for me, and I for the people, will now best Zero! You can have one of my arms. But in exchange...! You buffoon! That was a transparent move! Zero, what do I do?! Zero, your orders! Zero, I'm having trouble holding the line! They're ambushing me! "Black Knights General Staff Headquarters" This is the first I've heard of it. There are also reports that you have had an uprising. It's a military exercise. Where is Mr. Shesthaal? He isn't feeling well. What about the search for Miss Nunnally and Zero?! I believe it's impolite to ask that of only our nation. It would be one thing if we had a treaty with the United Federation of Nations, but why would the Black Knights be involved in this matter? It is suspicious, isn't it? I'm pinned down. At this rate... What do we do? Tell me, what do we do? Contact Zero, would you?! What do you want me to tell you? They're jamming communications. So this is where you are, my lord. I have a report. An emergency alert has been issued for the area around the capital, but it appears to have been a ploy to draw us all inside. What is our next move? Next? Next we... Next we... Give up? Under the circumstances... Things are desperate, is that it? Yeah. I was the same way. I was desperate, journeying in search of even a pinhole of light. But even so, I never gave up. I was sure that someday, I would bring you back, all that time. And now... This isn't the you that I wanted to get back! I wanted the pompous, egotistical, overconfident one, the Lelouch who never, at any time, gave up. I'm sorry. I didn't... mean to dump all of this on you. You can pull out. This is farewell. What a self-centered woman you are. All right, C.C. This enemy possesses a Geass. A Geass? How do you know? It's my hypothesis. Given that assumption, we'll narrow down what their Geass does. If we're wrong, we'll just re-think it from the start again. Oh, and one other thing... Rescuing Nunnally is non-negotiable. We cannot leave that out. I got you now! You did it! But how are we going to contact Zero? Huh? That's simple, isn't it? Whichever you like. Choose one of them and look over it. That will be our plan from here on. I get it. Only I will know the details, right? - Right. Geass doesn't work on you, after all. - Zero! Hey, Zero! Zero!! Zero! Zero! Hey, Zero! Zero!! - The question now is, how do we tell the others what the first step is? - Zero! Hey, Zero! Zero!! Zero! Zero! Hey, Zero! Zero!! What is that? It's on military and civilian channels. Zero! It's me! It's me! Tamaki! We took over an enemy Knightmare, and-- You idiot! Stop blabbing everything over enemy channels! Yeah, but...! You're hopeless! You're hopeless! No, you've done well! Huh? We have this available to us! C.C., hack everything you can. Got it. Big sister, I've become the greatest. Strong enough to protect you. Attention, everyone! My name is Zero. We are now entering the final phase of the mission. There's another Zero? Which means... You really were in that one! Over a Zilkhstani channel? But what is the "final" phase? My name is Zero. Those of you who stand with me, we are now entering the final phase of the mission! It makes sense. Now the radio interference doesn't matter. But what is the "final" stage? Does he mean the last part of the operation? Or is it some new strategy? My lord? Should we strike back? So, what is the "final" phase? It doesn't mean anything. Though I doubt the enemy will think so. That's what I'm talking about. Attack pattern? Already chosen. But before we do this, won't our allies be confused by this? Not a problem. All that's left is to narrow down the conditions. Damn you, Zero. You deliberately announced yourself. Notify all forces that guarding the perimeter has top priority. What is this "final" operation? I haven't heard a thing about it. It's a trick. Doing this should diminish the enemy's actions for now. It's an order to take advantage of that to regroup. You do remember that my brother never knows when to quit, right? Their commander is slow to give up. Princess Shamna, message from Generalissimo Forgnar requesting that you evacuate to Udunmu Base. He expects me to run now? We do not know exactly how many terrorists there are, and there was that announcement earlier. The Fifth Fleet? Yes, Highness. If Chief of Staff Schneizel is joining up with them, the United Federation of Nations means business. Isn't this a little unusual? Mr. Shesthaal isn't coming on anymore, either. All right, C.C., you're in command for the rest of the mission. All right. Although you did come up with this plan in the first place. CIC to Rook 1: Execute as planned, focusing on urban areas. Rook 1, copy. Why are the terrorists using our channels? We're hearing their whole plan! What is it? Princess Shamna, it's too dangerous here. Please make your getaway. This operation is more important right now. I cannot allow it to cost you your life. I will take you to the castle first-- Should I intercept the terrorists' aerial units first...? What about the search for Miss Nunnally and Zero?! I believe it's impolite to ask that of only our nation. It would be one thing if we had a treaty with the United Federation of Nations, but why would the Black Knights be involved in this matter? Rook 1 to CIC. Enemy forces are deployed around the target area. Executing the mission will be difficult. They even know our infiltration routes? In that case, our next move... CIC to Rook 1. Abort mission. Rendezvous here. CIC to Bishop 1. Carry out your assignment. Very well. Experience my loyal heart! Electricity from the power plant has been cut off. Princess Shamna, just a moment, please! They went after the substation. No time to wait for them to restart. Wha--?! CIC, they were lying in wait for me. I am now falling back. That didn't work either. I don't know the details of the mission. Yeah. I'm the only one who knows, but Geass doesn't work on me. Which means that the enemy's Geass isn't the sort that reads a specific person's thoughts. Also, whoever possesses the Geass is someone who can manipulate the country at will or someone next to them. Are you suggesting it's Shalio, the king? No. He's too fixated on Suzaku. The princess, Shamna, and Forgnar, in the castle, are more suspect. For now, we should engage Aegis mode and move on to the next plan. Hmm? Yeah. Something is off. Despite this nation having abducted Nunnally, they haven't made use of any of her intelligence. Which would mean that Nunnally herself is the objective. But what kind of move is that? It's as though they don't care if they lose their country. Wait, if they achieve their wish, the country won't be lost? Then... Hey, they beat us to the punch here, too. With a cover over the vents, a gas attack on the temple will take too much time. What do we do? That looks like terribly rushed work. It looks like the Black Knights will be striking here in four hours. What do we do? Order Suzaku and the others to fall back until the main force-- No. If we pull back now, they'll just tighten their defense of Nunnally. C.C., find out how many hours ago this work was carried out. All right. Now, I've narrowed the enemy's Geass down to 22 patterns. Nonetheless, if I run out of moves first, it's all over. Seventeen--no, 16... Twelve... I still haven't figured it out. Eight. Good, that eliminates the leads on Forgnar. Can we still hold out? Three. No more advisers. The enemy is Shamna. But still... Two. It's no use. I'm all out of moves. I don't have the conclusive evidence that will keep Nunnally safe. The last one is a coin toss. What a miserable turn of events! At last, my wish-- You died again, didn't you? Nunnally, if I connect one more time, I'm sure... I won't allow that. Are you trying to gain access to Cs' World? Your face... You're the treacherous Emperor Lelouch? I see. So that's what's going on. Fate is amusing. To think that I would come face to face here with the reason why I had to lay this plan... Is it true that the Black Knights will be landing in four hours? Yes. I see. Shamna, do you know why I nearly conquered the world? Who cares? I'm sure you must know, since you possess the same Geass as me. I was surprised. Imagine, someone having the same Geass as I had. This is going to take a while. Would you mind serving us some mint tea? Oh, not very good at that? I'm sorry. "The same as mine"? You mean... Take it easy. There are any number of ways he could have learned that. But the fact remains that he has me cornered to this extent. Is this the first time he and I have spoken? Or...? What's the matter? You're free to use your Geass. Well, what will it be, Shamna? Insolent fool. Why don't you show me your power first? Don't kill him! You must not kill this man! Good! Now all of the conditions have been cleared! You tricked me! You do not have the same Geass that I do! You coward! Hmph, what I wanted to know is what your power was and how to activate it. Astonishing. You have the power to go back through time with your death. Are you using Nunnally to try to freely choose the time you go back? Tell me, Lelouch, don't you have any past that you wish to do over? With my Geass of unlimited rebirth, you could change the past. There would be no need for you to be branded the treacherous emperor and forced to leave this world. If you join forces with me now... Don't deny me. Pain, sorrow, regret-- It's because of them that I became who I am. Do not take my scars from me. Don't you want a better future? The future is the sum of many people. There will be mistakes and failures, to be sure. The same is true of this country. I am... ...right! No, you are not. You are mistaken, Shamna. This is not the path a ruler should go down. Then what will you do? Kill me? Me, Shamna? No. You're going to go to sleep. Forevermore! Sleep? Are you sure it's okay to leave her like this? From what I read in the construction orders, she can go back through time less than nine hours. So we're going to blow this place up ten hours from now. If she does go back through time using her Geass, she'll be asleep and unable to do anything. What's going on? Why can't I contact big sister? Where are the prophecies?! Contact with the temple itself has been cut off, and-- Something's wrong with the transmission. The backups are locked out. Hey, do you read me?! My name is Zero. The mission succeeded! Nunnally is in our hands! That's a patent lie. To my allies, retreat from the battle. The mission succeeded! You are free to abandon your Knightmares. All personnel, coordinate accordingly at once. This will be your last order from Zero. Live on. That is everything! Let's see, attitude control, attitude control... Dr. Lloyd, how's the bleeding? It's stopped. She just needs a transfusion now. Blaze luminous, was it called? Once you run out of energy, you're done for! Damn that Zero. It was a disinformation campaign. All personnel, apprehend all terrorists in your sectors. I want them dead or alive! We will be the ones who prevail! Guilford, I'm charging the castle, even if I have to do it alone. You can't! I just have to beat them. If I don't, I'll at least be a decoy. We will accompany you. Suit yourselves. Let's go! What is going on here? Big sister, I'm coming back now. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! There! I apologized my brains out, now let's do this! Shanti, I'm sorry. Your Frame Coat is not cut out for a brawl. Being lighter just means that your guard isn't as high, either! That thing has a counter-Knightmare mode they were hiding? I can do this. Hey, Nunnally? Don't tell me her consciousness is in Cs' World! The gateway under the prison has been destroyed. We have no choice but to use the gateway that Shamna built. I tracked you down, you terrorists! I'm impressed you managed to make it this far in an unarmed Knightmare, while under my Geass. However, it ended up being all for nothing-- Damn it all... The energy filler... Witch of Britannia... I will surround you and crush you. The only one I want is Forgnar. Understood. She broke through?! Forgnar! Show me what you're made of! It's over for you, Forgnar! If you value your life, stand down! Attention, all forces: blast the Witch of Britannia, and me along with her! I could have done this alone, you know. I couldn't have that. Then go over there. That's where Nunnally is. What about you? There's something I need to check. I need to get back first, and move your bodies some place safe, too. I wonder, how much time has passed since you all left the Order, Shamna the Divine? It's nice to meet you, Master C.C. Did you fail to make it? Perhaps not. Mine was originally a look-ahead Geass, which changed to become the power it is now. A result of your reason becoming corrupted. Since I couldn't go anywhere, I embraced a dream. To remake the world of men. In my land, fighting is the only thing that brings in money. Lelouch's peace backed us against a wall. Ironic, isn't it? Because of Lelouch, you will now wander for eternity between life and death. What will you do? I'm willing to send you along. In here... In here, I can meet with the lives of those who were lost for me. Someday, that will be Shalio. Shalio, how many times have you been hurt and lost your life for me? If that is your desire, I can do nothing, but don't leave any regrets. Got it! From this position...! Hey, Rashid! Samsa! José! Which means that if I bring her down, more money for me! My Batalalan Du is second to none when it comes to hardness! I can figure out my attack while I'm withstanding yours! Suzaku? He's got a problem enemy over there, too. Big sister! Your prophecy! How do I beat this guy?! Even without a prophecy... for big sister... for the people... I will fight! Nagid Shu Mane, one more time. You can keep up, right, body of mine?! Hey, are you sure you want to get this rough with me?! You're going to wind up spending all your energy. Besides, you'll never get through my armor by just ducking me! You're right. That's why I'm going to quit ducking. Buffoon! Yeah, yeah. You know, you're strong. Honestly. Screw this! The prophecy! What happened to the unbeatable prophecy?! My... money! What is that? I don't know. I can only guess they're the regrets of lots of people. I have to at least save you, Nunnally! No! I haven't been able to tell you anything yet, big brother! Not yet...! What is this? Is Zero still asleep? I'm sure he's exhausted. Wait a little longer. We're the ones who are exhausted, after carrying them back here. What are you doing? Hurry up and come back. All the minds who make up this space, I, Lelouch Lamperouge, command you! You will... Nunnally... Y-Yes, big brother? My Geass is my sin to bear. Which is why... Oh, so we're to be saved by you once again? Why...? Why...? Why?! Now you will pay for your crime of snatching away Nunnally and disrupting the peace! Crime?! Crime, you say?! What else does Zilkhstan have besides fighting?! Give up. This fight is over. It's not over! For the sake of big sister, who bears the weight of this land, I will become the mightiest warrior! Is he...? A stalemate is not the same as a loss! How many people have suffered to allow me to maintain my body? If I lose now, then for what reason have I...? Tell me, big sister. What should I have done? Big sister, I can see light... Why? Why can't I reach Princess Shamna or King Shalio? Men! What are you waiting for?! I thought I ordered you to shoot us, including myself! Why aren't you shooting?! Stop. Your soldiers know that you, Bolvona Forgnar, are Zilkhstan's last bulwark. Thus ends the prophecy. We have a news bulletin concerning the abduction of WHA Honorary Consultant Nunnally, otherwise known as the "Puzzlement in Hashvess." Early this morning, a special squad led by General Cornelia succeeded in rescuing her. The honorary consultant is said to be unharmed. It looks like not even the prophecies of that nation, which vexed all others, could work against him. It looks like the landing by the Black Knights is getting underway. Well, now you can get some proper treatment. I'm sorry you missed out on getting the credit. Oh, no, we might be able to go to another war-torn region now. It feels like congratulations are in order. - What was that?! - Where is Princess Shamna?! Big brother! Thank goodness. What, is he finally awake? Perfect timing. Things are incredible outside. Huh? What is this? You made it back, Lelouch. See you, Suzaku. You can have that back. But... Like I said, I was only temporary. I can't stay here. Big brother... Hmm? What is it? I've... I've regretted some things for a long time. That I didn't realize your true intentions. That I ever doubted you. Don't worry about that. Big brother, let's live together! Once again, like we used to! You don't have to carry your guilt by yourself. I'm just as guilty, after all! Thanks, Nunnally. You forgot something. O-Oh, thanks. What's this? You're leaving all alone? I can't be a part of any public group, but I'll stop in every so often. There are already so many people fleeing the country. Tell me, we did the right thing, didn't we? That... is something history will decide. All we can do is what we believe to be right, as best we can. C.C.! Hey, wait up, C.C.! You haven't changed at all in that regard. It's not that...! You just... left without... saying anything... So, what is it? Did I forget something? I'm coming... with you... Huh? What about Nunnally? Nunnally... Nunnally can live just fine on her own now. If I'm around, I'll just be in her way. Then there are other options, right? You could go and pay a visit to Shirley or Kaguya, couldn't you? I am planning to contact Shirley at some point, but if I go now, it will cause a huge scene. Hmph, if you're looking for someone to wait on you, look somewhere else. I'm on my way to track down the Geass fragments that Shamna left behind. What about you?! You bring someone back to life without asking, and now you're neglecting them? Hmph, such a self-centered woman! You didn't know that? Yes, I am self-centered. Besides, what are you going to do about your name? If word gets out, it's going to be a huge deal. My name? Well, taking it from Lelouch Lamperouge, how does "L.L." sound? Huh? No good? I heard your voice on endless nights You pervaded the mornings when I awoke There were times when I stood paralyzed by the multitude of things I'd lost Nonetheless, rising back on my feet was the promise I made to you Revive! Everything I've stumbled across Revive! Lives on within my heartbeat Revive, revive, revive! I won't waver anymore Revive! The feelings that connect us (connect us) Revive! Ignite a flame that can't be shaken (can't be shaken) Revive, revive, revive! Coming back to life now Revive! So here you are again today Revive! I sing this song to you Revive, revive, revive! An indelible, eternal Revive We are one and we are strong! No one can stop us We are one and we are strong! Awakened at last Oh, here we stand! Because of our love Revive! Before these thousands of stars, Revive! I solemnly pledge to you now Revive, revive, revive! I won't waver anymore Believe me, Revive! Revive, revive, revive! I've finally realized Revive! Everything I've stumbled across Revive! Lives on within my heartbeat Revive, revive, revive! Now, stretch out your hand and Revive for tomorrow You don't say. By having Geass, you're able to live. However, the same power that allows you to live in the world of men forces you to live by different principles than man's. A different logic. A different time. A different life. The king's power may isolate you. We'll take Geass from those who don't have the resolve. However, if they do have the resolve...
