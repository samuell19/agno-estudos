You know what they are Machine. - Delete. - off shall I? - throw it in the trash. - Son... Not to beat up too much on the technology I need. So you're getting the benefit, of course. This is a need you can't deny that I have the part now. Remember either I mean, you admitted in the past that don't have the same needs as me? There were. They were communicating with pigeons. This abundance of what heart mean. It says, look, young man. Divit inkwell. in the Topkapi Palace in the afternoon, I'll get you out of there.

I'm warning our sister. How the kid, younger brother is having fun? I said to the boy, I'm sorry. You okay bro, how are you? Thanks... took all the information in the world of communication. It's an unfortunate thing that technology to make a joke about... when describing the more ...gets old real fast, you know? That unpleasantness. I tell you this because you don't know my story you've already finished, and you're done. So, my whole story I just people communicating with each other. The majority on top of him. Currently have communication with the universe, you know? Haberlesenl the universe. Kuantumcu! I'm completely throwing out the negatives. I'm sending to the universe. The next one talks to, speaks to the universe. there is a girl at work, it annoys me! E talk? Dialogue setup? You tell him? No! I'll send out to the universe. From the universe if you can't, I'll get him off the puck. Any of you guys? There are. Very fashionable for a few years. Kuantumcu! Ulan apagir quantum physics to the arm. So the book is like a brick. "Introduction to quantum." So you ask what physics knows nothing... what macro Cosmos, micro Cosmos. I don't know... ...what was it, electrons, protons... I don't know what, there is no information. What is dark matter, what's going on? The universe is expanding? They destroy. From Apple "The Secret" book... Wake the fuck up, he looks next to the Book of starch! How deep can a thing be so? rice flour, starch, AA, that I'm getting a flood! The secret... Communication with the universe. The universe is sending. Hmmm... Always material things is all about. Thousand pounds you want to say... get completely into the universe! BIN! BIN! The tape measure in their hand or not or do you know? The measure also they don't know. Fuck the world, you know, this is the place. Got a lot of ground on foot and unpublished so... the world even more unresolved. How many planets in the solar system? Eight, nine? I had one a troubled planet. How many planets in the solar system, ABI? You can't solve by looking here, is that you know in advance- how many planets are there? Eight? Nine of our childhood- Pluto! Pluto you had last? A pity that didn't turn out to planet baby. That would be bad luck? Thirty billion years it's orbit. A science teacher in a Brown suit says, "Pluto's not a planet!" E I'm in orbit, and thirty thousand years, I'm going back to that. You have inspired this one? You dared Saturn? you go, you go. But go wide... The solar system, you know... the distance between the distance can be measured in ...and now it's not. As big as the solar system. Billions from this solar system, galaxies. That of the Galaxy this big cloud. There are hundreds of billions from the cloud. There are hundreds of billions of her. Why am I telling you this? E mail from America now, anything you demand; coming in three days is the fastest. So, you want a thousand pounds from the universe, when it comes to...just to let you know Him from hundreds of billions from it... All the mass that you collect, in the face of the whole he was doing it. Also there's so much space, you know? So, the big boot on the other foot... [EFFECT OF AN IMITATION OF] CEVVVVVVIR! Exhausted from the heat of the entire universe... Ah, the " Bahattin? Thousand pounds of water data. Don't pay attention to such things. You have your powers of your beautiful work, don't pay attention to them. My job now it's a little weird. I sometimes ask young people, "do you have Sandra: I really coddling?"... ...I'm determined, I'd pass. There is so much coddling that it's not a brilliant work, but... Look up to where a thing could be so... what a beautiful day, working two hours a day. Speaks to the audience in the foyer... what works for two hours a day is good. Turns out, talking on the landing. I work two hours, but every second was filled. Two minutes work for you sometimes you don't. 09.00 - 17.00 I'm saying to employees. The hidden unemployed. A lot... The firm comes at nine... Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning, Madam Burcu! - Good morning, Kamil! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! 11: 00! Up his computer Solitaire, King, Queen, and paste. Tweeter, "I am at work. We came back again ... " blah, blah, blah. A morning meeting now, "what are we doing today?" or something. After that, "Mehmet Bey, what's for lunch?" I'll have a soda it stops. In the afternoon a meeting...more What are we doing today? Service what time does it leave? What happened? I worked. There are doubts about efficiency. There used to be a joke on the public sector. the five people he's put to the government ABI copy! In the beginning, there is also a coordinator... duplex! Duplex! Duplex! Like in the private sector it's very different! Now, there are of course many beautiful works. What great titles there are, I'm sure him. So, I don't think him a wannabe comedian. The title is very important! For instance, in our profession there is. So if the king did this "Professor Comedian!" is not a thing. You have the titles. Behold, The "Coordinator". "Sales Representative, Director Of Marmara Region" Sales Representative! When there is a sale so that it represents, you know? Pinar Lady From Human Resources. Coordinator, General Coordinator. Director, General Manager. CEO! The semiallahu hamideh of lime! What titles, what a title! We, for instance, we use them as mocking. Call the coordinator between us we're doing no business. When shooting a movie or something. "Coordinator" or so. Those who don't do any work Coordinator to do business. Also general Coordinator, not to make poor grades for those who don't. To the beginning of the title "general" is here... title holder ...he's playing, he's happy. However, it is ridiculous. For example, the beginning of something, so see it as language knowledge. The beginning of a concept to "general" when it comes to the negative meaning it falls, see? For example, a definition of culture, is huge. You can't tell Paragraflarca culture! General culture, a description of a low Dink. A definition of home. Home! Brothel, it's over. The Director General did you put it... The Director-General. My favorite title Intern. The backbone of a company! Intern! There among you Intern? Intern, Oh, my darling. Money... don't. The intern. Already slaves of the trainee is French. The intern. [French] work, work, work... - Money? no money. They say it's our company you called, right? It's called the company. That called in today, will try it tomorrow, will try it tomorrow. The fuck is he a man in our country ends. However, the company give you 20 a month on paper, you Company try. Isn't that better? What sector are you in? [By spreading your mouth] E - Food. E - food, new? Electronic Food. E - Food, in other words, a product's. Completely over the internet. So... Like Apple says, Apple in the shape of a mailing. E-Food. Normal "e" on "e"? [By spreading with your mouth Open] e... The point is this. Do you read me, baby? Read, look! My dear brother. What Are you reading, bro? You're in high school, in college? High school, senior year. Do you have a dream profession have you chosen? So... Very cool, man, forget it. Self-employed, is the most beautiful. See farfetched a dream like this instead of thinking I appreciate. So because I'm not anything, kid, of course I will support. Just him is all I want to be a comedian. But, for example, when he gave an unexpected profession, families upset, even surprised. What fret, it was something else. So, we never expected family, unexpected unexpected the profession are turning to the boy sometimes. Especially when younger. I'll be a fireman! Fireman, where are they coming from the influence of their minds... these Hollywood. So, we call the Hollywood Effect. Now you are watching in the movie. N. Y. F. D Fire Department Of New York! Colin Farrell is a lot like this coming down the pipe. Men like Brad Pitt like in the flames. I want to be a fireman says. Then happens, is in the hands of tea that is sitting in the firehouse in Fatih. brother saban, pipe want to skate? Ehe! He hoped that Hollywood just can't find the action. Last I was a kid, about your age. I'll be a lawyer said. I said Look, it's beautiful, but I said... So we need Courthouses. The needs of the legal world. Everyone agrees that's a career, it's beautiful. But I said, If you want to be if you would be disappointed with Hollywood effects. Now an American has a court scene. A cliche in the movies, court scenes. The lawyer spread the theatrical movements... how much it's spread. your honor, I object. So now the US Courthouse in your mouth bow, starts from 6 months. Appeal where to protest! As the file's head already. Courthouse it says, but you like Pacman that maze... justice, justice, justice, justice. theatrical American Court. I object. Close! Rejected! Sustain! Overload! The jury, jury, you're leaning. this the man you saw, in fact he's not the guy you see. Of us who have throat so red in the courthouse? I'll tell you, bailiff. He's the most shallow one. Bring in the accused. Muharram, 2 units of tea. The bailiff, who wants to be. Not to be left out in the open, you'll know the truth, it is. But like I said in the title, the title is beautiful. Don't run from the only title, of course, your business... Now, back home from work, so the number of people who are not satisfied. In fact, we ourselves always want to crush, you know? "Brother, go or anything but we're not happy we're coming." You put yourself down in the bar... you know? Look, we were making a movie in the opium. I haven't seen such an example. A great lesson, I'm telling intimate. In Afyon we're filming. The film baby diaper manufacturer. You know, in the first ages goes. We're filming in opium. So nature or something appropriate, such thing we're in a place a little farther from town, the camp life. Even when it is crowded and at least 150-200 people we are. We are full most 400 persons. We need such a commode. If you've requested from the municipality in such a commode? Like to address the requirement. They sent a garbage truck a car from astern, but the car is very old. So, with begging eyes looking at me, "your shit brother..." 400 people have it, or are part of a meal, you understand. It is not possible for us to endure. Like I said camp life or the difficult circumstances or something. Toilet, so intense, something to be used. We opened the phones blah, blah, blah, this does not save us. Not remember wrong now, received a call from Istanbul from Bursa. There is a bus very frequent, you can hire such organizations Toilet. He's waiting for coming. We are working constantly. Abi arrived on a bus, the set approached. Razor! Landed through two men, father and son. They opened their sun. Glasses mounted, this Salvatore Ferragamo. Such plug he stood. They said: "the toilet." Our team said: "Don't got this shit in the US." Now, you gleaming. What I have to know or... Now we expect the guy who runs such a loser Toilet will be music. Because of that, it's kind of obvious. I mean...a loser - What Are you doing? - Toilet, brother ... eh eh. - How does it work? - Shit! Eh eh. Find an excuse to oppress ourselves. Look man, what did you do. The man is a bus Toilet design. Came like a razor. I went inside. Such plasma televisions, PlayStation, Skylife magazine. He also Eros is stealing. Tiziano Ferro plays. Everybody was like: "see, see!" Folks had to front fastening. Father and son, they stood like that the bathroom owners. The kit is prefect came to visit. So who is the producer went straight to the bathroom like that. We are walking around with shorts like this. Look, sincere... I said: "friend, this guy here is a sample man. Your own sets so that set the bar this time, you know... You've got to hear reverence. I said, I'm going to meet this guy, I went with it. I said: "dear brother, you are an interesting man, I want to recognize you." Cemcig. said. Or repentance and Ola. Subject the toilet or the toilet! cemcig, when you look at today... ...our job is to represent the summit in... Man is the latest in the digestion of... ...says the summit we represent. This self-confidence I admire. We we cemcig this summit. said. our country today, when you look at the biggest stars is always with us. said. in US, Tarkan, Kenan first time. , he said.
