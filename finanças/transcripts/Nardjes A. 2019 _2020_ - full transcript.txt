WELCOME TO THE CHAHID OUMAKHLOUF MAHMOUD DISTRICT How are you, Dad? Fine, how are you? Fine, fine. How are things looking in Tiaret? Normal. Is it OK, nothing has happened? No, why? Did something happen in Algiers? A little. It was tense. Yeah, it was a bit tense. That's normal. I mean it is the capital. Yeah, it's becoming more discriminatory, more targeted... more "Algeria Islamic country", "El Harrach Islamic country"... That's clear... Algiers. March 8, 2019. Today is the third Friday and I can't miss the demonstration. But the problem is all public transportation is blocked. So I have to order a TemTem driver. My neighborhood Bachdjerrah is far from the center, so I have no other choice. My parents live here and family is my epicenter. I barely slept three hours. The day before the demonstration is like the eve of the Eid holiday when we were young. I'm not hungry. Nor sleepy. I wake up early and excited. I don't want to miss anything today. Before going out, I say a heavy-hearted goodbye to my parents. Anything could happen. My childhood was marked by the Black Decade. It was a nightmare for the Algerians. A lot of people were affected It changed a lot of lives. I don't know if I should laugh, or cry. Last summer I was so exhausted by my life here that I lost hope. Part of me wanted to get a visa, a one-way ticket and never look back. Another part of me, a part inhabited by Algeria, would not dare to leave. It's like I'm running away. I couldn't leave my homeland. After all these years, came February 22. From that moment on, I knew I couldn't leave the country. Now I'll stay. So do your stuff. We'll begin a bit later then. So you don't have to wait for me. OK, see you later. Kisses. Are you coming, too? Come and we'll go together! Hello! Adoula, Asma, how are you? Hello! Djidji? Who's upstairs? Today is March 8. Algerian people are known for their sense of humor. A Facebook post said women should go out without makeup to scare the policemen. So I did the opposite. I usually go out without makeup. So today I got my fake eyelashes, nails and make-up done. Now I'm going out. This is how I am. I do what I want. We protest every Friday not only to free Algeria, but to free every single Algerian. The Maghreb CafÃ© where I work is a place of joy: art, meetings, young people, exchanges... Since February 22, it has become a meeting place for protesters. The owner is a former Moudjahid (Freedom Fighter). I remember the first Friday. His son wanted to close the cafÃ© at prayer time. His dad shouted at him and demanded they stay open. He wanted the protesters to be able to rest and get something to drink before marching. VINEGAR No fifth mandate, oh Bouteflika The special police force is on our side Bravo, women! An elderly woman! For those who love the country: you won't be leaving. For those who worship power: it's leaving forever. Bravo, women! Bravo to you, too! Bravo, the people! Hand in hand, oh women, there won't be a fifth mandate Take some pictures. Do a youyou. All of you, do youyous. Perfect, we'll see each other there. Kisses, take care. I remember the first demonstration on the 22nd. It was incredible! Nobody knew who organized it. I went out of curiosity. It was the first time Algeria experienced anything like that. A lot of Algerians feel the same way: for the first time, we're feeling a sense of belonging with our fellow citizens and this country. It's true: we risk being sprayed with teargas and arrested. There's always a risk. But the more we go out on the streets, the less we fear. We're a republic and not a kingdom - Murderous. - Regime. One, two, three, viva Algeria! You're asleep. we're the awakening. Thieves, you ate the country Just go, seriously. I should be with my mother-in-law in the hospital, not here demonstrating. We're not kidding. We're tired. Just go. We're busy next Friday, we have stuff to do. I tell the truth. May God make the Algerian people overcome and triumph. May God protect our lives. I'm ill, but I still came to march. These are our children. This is our youth. We came to support them. This is our country. We adore it. All the lies will vanish with the help of God. We swear by the lightning that destroys By the virtuous and fragrant blood By the shining, fluttering banners In the steep and majestic mountains That we've risen to revolution In life or death And we've resolved That Algeria shall live So bear witness, Bear witness, bear witness Free and democratic Algeria! The first mandate, let's say it was OK Even if they cheated us With the religious war (Dark Decade) With the second mandate The story became more evident La Casa d'El Mouradia (district of the presidential palace) For the third mandate You robbed the country blind Blame personal interests With the fourth mandate The president was just a vegetable And on and on it goes We Ultras are a school. To be with us You need a CV and we'll educate you Today the people will free, free Algeria We want to live and stay in Algeria Get out, FLN! (Front de Liberation National, ruling party) Go! Go! All of you! All of you! We have to save freedom Freedom will save the rest What's the reason? Who am I to blame? We're sick of this life It's dawn and I can't sleep So I smoke a little bit Your sistem is rotten - Get out, get out. - We're not keeping quiet. Finally, we put on our play, you were fantastic! The Algerians ! Free and democratic Algeria! We want democracy. We want a country of young people. We don't need old people in the government. Old people must leave. Youth will remain. We're a country of young people, people under 25. It's their country, their country of origin. It's their birthplace and native country. They aren't going to flee. We mustn't want to go abroad. It's our country, it's our duty. We'll have to explain to our children: it's the history of Algeria. It's 1954! It's our history! We haven't forgotten France! The blood flows in our veins. Free and democratic Algeria! My father is a former member of the Algerian Communist Party. He was forced into exile in Germany in the 90s. I met him for the first time when I was almost three. When he returned from exile, I was already walking and talking. I was around three. When he first held me, he knew I was a lot like him. My mother was born in prison. Because my grandmother was in jail under the colonial occupation. My grandmother was released from prison after my mother's birth. She left my mother at her aunt's and rejoined the resistance. My grandfather died in combat a few months before my mother's birth. As the daughter of two martyrs, my mother was entitled to a pension. She cried when she got it. She said she felt responsible. Like she was betraying her parents. She kept repeating that they hadn't died for her to become rich, but for Algeria to be independent. Alas, my grandparents didn't live to see a free and independent Algeria. God, long live Algeria. My parents had high hopes for rebuilding the country. What a pity. The wolves took hold of the country, and Algeria drowned. I grew up in a family that won't accept injustice. I feel like I'm here to pay a debt to my grandparents and parents. I think... it's up to my generation to step up and speak out again. Palestine, Palestine Palestine, the martyrs (To the police officers:) Take your cap off and join us - Ouyahia (Ex-Prime Minister) is hiding! - You policemen are part of the people! Ouyahia is hiding! You policemen are part of the people! Bring on the special police force No fifth mandate, oh Bouteflika Is the special police force still here? Peaceful, peaceful - Murderous. - Regime. We need a real-life president, not only a picture - Murderous. - Regime. The people will bring down this regime Collective of the families of the disappeared in algeria (CFDA) Today, what fills me with joy is walking down the street. It's seeing that the youth has understood that if they don't take back their rights, no one will do it for them. This popular movement feels like a sporting event in a soccer stadium. Stadiums were the only places where the youth had the right to chant slogans against the regime. That has spread to the streets and no one can stop it now. The Algerian people have made history by inventing their own form of demonstration: celebratory, dancing, and, above all, the smiling protests. To be honest, before each demonstration... we're afraid. And right after, reality catches up to us. In some places, everything can go well, while in others, it doesn't. Protesters get beaten up. A lot can happen. So we worry. The moment when we all feel safe is when we're in the middle of a crowd. It's simple. You beat us, all we have to do is smile and kill you with peace. You've made our lives bitter. You're eating us from the inside like a cavity. We're leaving the darkness with a smile. You tear each other apart. And us? We'll unite. You're injustice and terror. We are great. This is the people We're tired of this, enough, give us back our country! Let us live in peace! Peace! We're looking for peace! We're tired of this power. Peace! Long live peace! ... democracy, Amazigh, Arab, make racism disappear... The people! The whole world is with us! Long live Algeria! Even I am angry, how did my country become like this? May God punish you! May God punish you! Amen. With God's help we will succeed! As our grandparents did! - Bouteflika, oh! - The president has no idea! Give us back our country Peaceful How long? For how long have we been patient? For how long have we been patient? For how long have we been patient? We're tired of waiting! We must get back our rights in our own country! We're tired of it! We're sick and tired of this regime That's enough, that's enough, from the government mafia. Long live the revolution He took a jar of injustice And began to imbibe it He betrayed his ideals And began to despise everyone he met His father wasn't like that He had dignity and integrity One word, followed by another He asks me to follow And roll up my sleeves Me, I'm the son of a dignitary My father's name is printed On all the letterheads How dare someone As undignified as you solicit me He spit up into the sky And it fell back in his face Every Kabyle only respects his relatives They all say that the father is innocent But his son belittled him Our ancestors taught us That the grain grows like it falls, But I don't believe that His father is a dignified man How is it possible that the son isn't? There will be no fifth mandate for France's sons Vinegar. Should I give him vinegar? Exactly, it's a pharmaceutical... When the government pushes, by any means, the people in the streets, disobedience is not a right but a national duty. Older generations always despise the younger generation. They thought we couldn't do anything or, above all, change anything. But I disagree. I've always believed in this generation. I've always believed in them. It's true they've never had a choice. But now we've realized we have to break from old Algeria. Now that we demonstrate together, we've realized our differences don't divide us. On the contrary: what has made this popular movement very strong are its diversity and its differences. It's up to us. And today, this generation has surprised everyone. Thanks a lot. OK. Where are you? We're downtown. Everyone's going home now. I'll try to take Debussy Street. Right now I'm on Didouche Street. I'll meet you at the Telecom agency. The Telecom agency. The Telecom agency. Thieves, you've eaten the country Only one hero: the people. I owe a lot to the theater. It has helped me a lot. It has made me who I am. I've done a lot of amateur theater. Theater for me has never been a breadwinner. At the moment with what's happening in Algeria, my friends and I have made a play called "Freedom." It's a street show to be performed in the middle of demonstrations. Excuse me? No. Enough. No. No. I know why... I already said: enough. I'm not going to be nice anymore. You don't want to understand. May God forgive me. That's great to hear. Thank God. Did you see any? No, there were no clashes here, there won't be any. So how are you doing? God willing, Mom. I'm OK. No, I'm fine. Who? May God forgive me. Inshallah, when I get back. Yes, yes. Probably, yes. Fortunately. Seriously? That's not the problem, Mom. That's not it. Correct. So as soon as... No, no. I don't need anything, don't worry. Alright, Mom. Take care. See you later. Don't worry. No, really, don't worry anymore. It's nothing. A lot of emo... That's it. Exactly. Don't worry. Kisses, Mom, OK. Sometimes I tell myself that Algeria won't change. It'll stay the same, the victim of years of mismanagement. Sometimes I give myself the right to dream of a better Algeria. But in reality, a person like me doesn't dream. You survive with the goal of living in peace. Sometimes you just don't want to run into disturbing situations. After demonstrating all day, I don't go home right away. I wander around and call everyone. With a heavy heart, afraid of people not answering their phones. Because we can get bad news at any time. If someone doesn't show up, we have to wait 24 hours to know if they've been arrested or injured, or even worse. Hey, sister. The others haven't arrived yet? OK, so give me some water. Here I am. Thank you. I love you, sister. Thanks, dear. Tell Amel I was here. Anyway, at the end of the day when I call home, I sense my parents' relief when they hear my voice and know I'm safe and sound. And it's the same for me: it's comforting to talk to them. Now, when I call my mom, I feel her tone has changed. She's known to be protective. If she had her way, I'd never leave home. She has understood there's no way. Staying at home and missing everything that's happening in Algeria? Then she became proud of me. Sometimes I feel her living vicariously through me at this historic moment. I don't know. Manel told me to wait for her in the city center. But no news and I don't know where the others are. Now I'm looking for a place to meet up with her. In Maghreb CafÃ©. I'll call them. At the Maghreb? Try to call them now if you can. - Hello. - Tassadit! - Hi. Hello, it's Nardjes. - How are you doing ? - Everything fine, and you? Listen, I spoke with Manel and she said they didn't hear from you. - Is everything OK? - It was a bad day. May God preserve you, my dear. Where are you? With Amin in the city center. I'm at El Biar. I'm going to rest and then go out. I need it. Where are you? I have to go out. - Where are you? - I'm not far. Next to my house. You're going home? Yes, and then I'll go out afterwards. And where are you going afterwards? - Sorry but... - That's ok. Alright, we'll go to Olivier Restaurant then. We'll go to the Olivier then. Try to call Manel and the others because I can't reach them. OK, see you in an hour. Bye. I'm so glad you're OK. What did I do? I didn't mean to... For you O my country We sacrifice our souls for our land We were once giants Humiliating our enemies In the War of Independence And today we're giants With peace, we're protecting our values For you, for you O my country We were heroes Who did not allow Anything but glory to greet us Proud of our past And the present overrides our past We set off the Revolution Oh eternity, note our excellence Then the grand victory was ours Glory made by our own hands For you, for you O my country The Liberation Army and its Front Were the two lights on our crown They said At the beginning that our dignity And the people reign here We share the richness of the people Justice is part of our values I have no reception. OK, call me when you're finished and we can go together or meet there. OK, I'll call Manel and... - Try to call the others. - OK, I'll call Kadi. Explain to Kadi what happened. Oh, damn, they closed. It's OK, I'll just grab my keys. - Thanks. - No problem. Thanks, buddy. See you. How cute! - That's wrong. Why did you go there? - I did it for myself. No, no. So why did you go to the presidential palace. You wanted to get hurt? That's not the goal, Manel! That's not our goal. Everything was great in the city center. Exactly, but I think I'll be able to be heard anywhere I am. Exactly! Then why go to El Mouradia? Why? Are there any wounded among us, injured people whom we know? No, I didn't know any of them, but... today I even took off the pants of some hurt boys. I saw this one guy's ass! I swear! Too much information! Throughout the day, I'm so emotional that going home alone scares me. That's why I go out at night. If I go back home after such an intense day, and sit alone at home, I get really anxious! Could I have a lemonade? Without alcohol. Is it haram (sinful) to donate your organs? What!? - Seriously? - Yes, it's haram to donate your organs. But it's not the body that goes to God, it's the soul! It's not the body! When night falls after the demonstrations, I meet my friends in one of our regular restaurants. We sum up what happened that day, whether it was good or bad. It became a habit for us to externalize the emotions of the day, so no one will take negative vibes home with them. We're tired. We're fed up with having our youth taken away from us. So we haven't yet found another solution, other than living the present as it is. So we're giving this moment our very own personal touch. We live the moment with a lot of optimism, and a lot of hope. So afterwards in the restaurant, it's party time! We're so excited and emotionally saturated by what happened that day, we've agreed that partying is the solution. While partying, we just let go. Personally, I've gotten used to going dancing. I let myself be carried away by the music, the lights, and the joy. I sing for love In the middle of guerrilla warfare I'll love you forever, my Algeria I sing for love In the middle of guerrilla warfare They don't want peace because Yhey don't know about guerrilla warfare In our minds, it's still guerrilla warfare Guerrilla, guerrilla I'm not there anymore If you're looking for me I'm not there anymore If she's looking for me I'm not there anymore If he's looking for me I come back from so far away So far, it could've been from the dead I dreamed we were no longer poor And that our successors were all dead But in reality, they escaped Or barricaded themselves You're gonna make it Mama said, "Be brave, my son" This one is nice, too. What's the reason? Who am I to blame? We're sick of this life It's dawn and I can't sleep So I smoke a little bit What's the reason? Who am I to blame? We're sick of this life The first mandate, let's say it was OK Even if they cheated us With the religious war (Dark Decade) With the second mandate The story became more evident La Casa d'El Mouradia For the third mandate You robbed the country blind Blame personal interests With the fourth mandate The president was just a vegetable And on and on it goes I looked for you everywhere! I looked for you everywhere, you know that? - Everyone's OK. - Great. Algeria means a lot to its people. It means a lot to me, too. All I want to tell you is: you don't know us. You refuse to look at us. You don't know what we want. You made us hate education, work and existence. You killed all the beauty we had inside. You stole our innocence. And me? I know you well. You underestimated us. My generation and I have suffered at your hands for 20 years. Even more. I won't forget. As the rebel that I am, I can tell you that neither me, nor my people, care about you. You've never talked to us. So we won't be talking to you. Us? We're talking to the Algeria of tomorrow. History is going to shut down
