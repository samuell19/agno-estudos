Many of you will recognize me of the documentary I make launched in 2017 the documentary was called The Blackwell Ghost If you have not seen it yet, I recommend look at it first. as it will provide context of what they are about to see Many of those who saw The Blackwell Ghost thought they had unmasked the mystery either simply because they realized of inconsistencies or because they did their "Investigation" and did not find nothing on the internet. I have news for you. Everything has a logical explanation. Except for those things that happen that not even I can explain Research is much more than typing a few letters on the keyboard from the comfort of your home Sometimes even if you are afraid of what you will find You have to go there and find it for yourself. Just like I did. And for those who think they figured out the mystery The only person they try to convince are you. The intention of this documentary is not to scare you. But that does not mean that sometimes not scary Having said that: Let us begin... I don't know what to do, I think I'll have to quit I hate to quit but I think I have no alternative And I think I'll probably go back to doing zombie movies. I'm actually not very good at doing that so ... i'm kinda fucked up well that's exactly what i ended up doing Action! right after the first documentary of The Blackwell Ghost ends I looked for anything that would put my mind off what experiment in that house I started shooting a new movie called "Racoon Valley" a kind of zombie movie with the script about a person who lives in an old house. Where was I going to find an old house? Interestingly, when I decided to downplay it Mrs. Blackwell finally ended up taking me back to her most of the movie would end up being shot in that house. So we went back and stayed seven days and seven nights when we filmed the rest of Raccoon Valley. While we were there, I decided to install some cameras while recording just in case something happened. However, strangely nothing happened. I was surprised that in the course of that time We would not hear or see anything out of the ordinary. And that's when I started to get confused. By day seven, we finished our last shot. And it was time to go home I gave him a second chance to show himself and he didn't. So I left thinking that was it. Until I got home and found something waiting for me. PART 2 verification okay. paints well. Hello everyone, so it's me again. New information has appeared. That made me go down here to my basement and take out my camera. So shortly after releasing the first documentary I received this strange package on my porch and I was not expecting nothing. So shortly after that package appeared. I received an email from a woman who asked me: Hey, did you get my package? And I was like ... ok? I then noticed that there were a number of phone in the emial. So I decided to call this woman. This is where she got interesting. Turns out this woman is a 92-year-old woman named Nancy who lives in Florida and claims that he personally knew to Mrs. Blackwell. My first question was how a 92-year-old lady know how to send emails but it turns out that it was simply his family that I was sending emails on his behalf. ok i am straying. I am sorry. So I asked him You know, I call, I'm talking to her on the phone and I'm talking to her for an hour. And I asked him how he knew Mrs. Blackwell. And then she has her family send me this photo. Now, I recognize this photograph. I used a small part that I found in archives for the cover actually for the first documentary. So he was very familiar with this image. But I had no idea that it was actually part of a much larger photograph. So immediately i knew nancy was telling the truth because it actually taught me something I didn't know. So you know, she gave me this photo. And I asked him, how did you meet Mrs. Blackwell? And that's when she tells me that she's the girl sitting next to Ruth in the photography. And then my jaw dropped. And I ran to my basement and took my camera. So at first glance this picture, you would imagine to Nancy as part of the Blackwell family. Well, that is not the case. I spoke with Nancy for more from one hour and she told me she was in this photo because she lost her family in a fire when she was a child and the Blackwells were his legal guardians or godparents I actually mentioned her clothes in the picture. And I always asked myself, since the clothes in this photograph are not coincides with the time the photo was taken she said they were like a cu�quera family and that they just lived in a different era. So after talking to Nancy for an hour I decided it was time to open the package so I have Nancy's package here. let's open it, we must remove the entire roll of tape. she does not she didn't tell me on the phone what there was here I have no idea what to expect ok, we have a folder, we have a picture they actually look like a few photos. So ok, the instructions we get right here please contact Richard ... Pittsburgh office, that company had Ruth's last known possessions. I have already contacted them and they will be waiting for you if you decide do the trip. Please find attached my signed consent form she already gave me a consent form to go pick up This in Pittsburgh, whatever it is. photos, I have attached some photos for you to see. These are some of the children that Ruth kidnapped and murdered. You know, this is creepy. This is the first time I have put a face to a victim. So I have a consent form, photos. And then it says vinyl record. Enclosed you will find a vinyl record. This is my only possession in addition to the photographs I have of Ruth. remember, it was her favorite album and she played it every night. You will need a special player to listen to it. I assume you mean a record player. Oh, I didn't even feel like there was anything else here. This is great. This is Ruth's favorite album. This is something she really touched. Man. This is great. I guess I'll have to get that special equipment. So, here we go. I'm going to close the door. Today we go to Pennsylvania to go to the state office and see what's in that building. Starting: KENTUCKY Landing: PENNSYLVANIA I got to downtown Pittsburgh. I'm in the office building that Nancy told me to she came to look the last remaining belongings of Ruth Blackwell. But I have my hopes on this one because there is a big box. And that's all there is to it. The first thing we have is good is plastic. I have to get this out quickly. original scanned documents they were with this CD, which says scanned we have a sign-in sheet. Looks like it's the hospital. Yes, it's the hospital's registration page. I see Ruth Blackwell. Ruth Blackwell's name is on him. And then we have this. It looks like a drawing is a copy. And then we have this beautiful note here that says that all the remaining possessions were incinerated due to mold. Well that's cool. Everything was cremated. And I'm sitting here with two or three sheets of paper that they are not even original. I feel like I flew three and a half hours for nothing. ... I just wasted my time. Not to mention, it smells like dead goat in here. I have to ... I'm done 2 WEEKS LATER you know, something very interesting just happened. I want, I want to be honest with you, ok? During last week I was debating whether or not I have enough material to move on to another Blackwell documentary. I mean, I'm really stressed. I don't have much material. I know I have Nancy who sent me those things. And I have these three documents from the office in Pittsburgh. But that's it. that's all I have. I mean, just imagine. I tried. I really tried to get materials So I flew my plane to the abandoned hospital where Ruth was interned and filmed a lot of images and edited them together thinking That would be amazing. It's the boring piece of shit I've ever recorded. And I was like, man, I finished. That is all that I have. You're trying to make chicken shit chicken salad. But when you least expect it It was then that I found perhaps the most interesting up to now about Mrs. Blackwell And she was staring me in the face the whole time Now let me show you guys. So this is the black and white drawing from the state office, to be fair to myself you can't see what i found in this picture. But when I opened the CD that was in the files these are actually high resolution scans of the ease, and show a little more. Let me show you what I found very quickly in the drawing. I will have to do this in PowerPoint, let's go to PowerPoint. So let's take a closer look at this image found in Ruth Blackwell's belongings. The first time I looked at the drawing, honestly, I had no idea what he was looking at. At first, I thought it was some kind of thermos or vacuum cleaner, those were my first guesses. But uh, so I decided to go dark first the lines in the drawing hoping that would shed some light on what he was seeing somehow. But that was not very helpful. However, when I started to rotate the image I realized that I had been seeing her wrong the whole time. And that's when I realized that actually it was a drawing of the property you can tell by the location of the stairs and the kitchen since they are correctly represented in the drawing, as they are currently located in the house. However, something is missing from the sketch of the house. And that's this section right here which is not reflected in the sketch because it was added later by the new owners. confirm this with Greg. So this is the room here with which we are familiar and which is not included in the sketch. And then actually right on top is the master bedroom, this room. And if you remember, Greg actually said this: As for the ghostly activity, not much happens here. It is something strange. It appears that the entity respects my privacy for some reason. And I'm starting to think of something here. I suspect it is because this was not part of the original house. So what you're saying is like Mrs. Blackwell's ghost, just sticks to the rest of the house that was original and not the addition which is strange. I don't know if that's true. But it doesn't matter, let's move on So let's go back to the sketch when I realized what She was watching. I walk away and start looking at the backyard. And as you can see, there is a funny scarecrow here. above I can guess what a kind of garden is in that moment and here to the right, there is a strange thing And I can only guess it's some kind of shed with a cobblestone hallway. Now this thing that I think is a shed is actually where the current garage is located today right here, as you can see so let's go back to the picture, everything looks good. Nothing out of the ordinary so I know until you look very closely at something and that something is what it's behind where the shed was It's so dim. I didn't even realize it was there for a long time. And it's so dim. It's like someone tried to erase it in some time. You can see when I zoom in here, it's an x. And that's when I began to realize that this is not it was just any image. Possibly, this could be a map. And that's when I got really excited. Ok we are here. I just arrived after a long journey first things first We'll go back and check the corner. Terry are you coming? I'm going to have to move that. I'm going to move all these things. Yes, and? I didn't want to do it, it's a lot of work and it's going to rain. New look how small it is! Haha so small it seems from a show Oh oh Safety Test and Operate, so I guess I will put it in "Operate" I'll clean up all this trash before I use this thing Are you sure he agrees that we do holes in your backyard? it really depends on if we find something because it's possible don't make any holes He said is it okay? He does not care. He doesn't care. I can see how rude that would be. Would you mind asking him? He does not care. Ok I'll put this here. Careful. I'm going through Are we digging random holes in the yard again? We are not digging at random. I think it is what it is, is in this zone. on the map? Yes. Why do you think we drove here? I'm not digging here. that is, it could be where that tree is. I don't know ... I hope not But it seemed like it was closer. I'm going to find the metal detector and I'm going to sweep it all up. Why does it sound? Has no sense. No metal What do the instructions say? what? that is, it is self-explanatory. Here is a big red button. And it is not "operator". "Security test" "Operator" Damn! This, this doesn't work. There is no way this will work. In this metal thing here. That is metal. Should show me something Go find the instructions. I don't need instructions. Terry. Let me go get the instructions I'm not going to read the instructions. Oh, put the review dial in the middle. That's what he was doing wrong. She didn't know what it meant You were right, I must have read the instructions. I am sorry. Here we go. Yes, all good. Let's go back. I think I'll dig a little more come here, nothing. Nothing. just here come here I don `t believe here I hit something. There is something there. A stone? No it's flat There's a corner, a corner right there I feel it with the tip of my finger, I need to dig a little here look here there is a corner It looks like some kind of safe is closed sight Oh my gosh, what is that? should we tell him? I mean, do we need to tell you? I don't know, technically this belongs to him I don't know, I'm so excited. I really don't know what to do right now. I mean, I just want to take it home if it's okay And we can plug this hole and he won't even know what we were here. check this out. is old. I don't even know what that is. However, not even it looks like a safe. it's an old metal box Are you ready to go home? Yes let's put this on the cart. Can you believe it? I'm curious why someone would bury her You better hurry, there's a storm coming Oh my gosh. I'm still in shock from what we found. I can't wait to get home. and open that thing. It could be anything, it could be something like a time capsule. We just don't know. We'll find out soon. Well. Hello everyone. I don't even know how many cameras are recording in this little makeshift room. We are in my garage. I have the safe here. As you can see, I have put it on the table. And we about to open this thing And actually I went to the local locksmith and they said Based on what you could see, it only takes a flat-nosed master key. So I went to the local store and as you can see here I have Two master keys. The only problem now is that the eye The lock is still full of mud. So I have to get that shit out of there. Based on the weight of this thing, you know, I really don't know what to expect. It is quite heavy. I don't know what's inside But let's find out. I just hope I don't have to cut this with a shredder because that really sucks. It's a little muddy and oh my it's a great solid piece Pure mud. I'll spread some of that. Let's try one of these keys Here's the key, a master key flat tip Too much dirt Compressed air When everything else doesn't work out, use compressed air Well let's see if we can get our key in Oh much better However I can't turn it it goes in a bit but it's not spinning, let's try a little more let's heat it up Let's try the other key. I hope I don't have to shred this thing. I don't even know how to do it I just spun I just spun! OMG Ok I heard him unlocking so it should open * THE DOOR REMAINS COMPLETELY CLOSED Wow is completely filled to the brim earthen. I guess now I should get all this shit out. I will use this. I can't believe that thing opened it. In fact, it was a lot easier than I thought. This is crazy. Oh my gosh. So I'm going to start pulling these things out. I really don't have the best tool for this, so I'm going to use my hands. My fear is that there may be some film without developing inside. If that's the case, and there are movies here, so these lights will probably damage her I don't know, I'm just going to start digging. okay, here we go. I'm going to touch with my fingers to see if I feel something And I'm going to get it out here. One tablespoon at a time I will continue to draw I keep pulling As I take out, I try to feel if there is anything solid. I don't feel anything yet. It's completely filled to the brim, my God. maybe this is empty. I don't know. Pure mud. Well, it's half empty now. I'm halfway there I'm halfway there and I haven't felt anything yet. Maybe it's the end Start to... Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Terry, Terry. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm going to remove this from here. Oh my gosh. Well, this is scary. These are human teeth. a human tooth, there is a human tooth right there. They are everywhere. There is more here. This is full of teeth. Oh God. This is creepy. This is the creepiest thing I've ever come across in my life. And I am terrified. I'm looking at loads of these things. And it was crazy, I'm in shock now because I was pulling these things out by hand. And he had no idea what he was playing with. And then I thought, wait a minute. That doesn't look like gravel. I have to stop filming, because this could actually be illegal. it could be tampering with evidence. So I have to stop the camera and call my lawyer. wow. Shortly after opening the safe and discovering its contents. I was contacted by a film festival in Charleston, South Carolina. We wanted to release my feature film Raccoon Valley. We accepted the invitation and decided to take a trip to the event. Being close to Charleston, we decided to pass our free time with a sightseeing boat ride to a civil war monument the island of Fort Sumter, having fun and learning about the history of the island I was not quite prepared for the call I was about to receive a phone call that would change my life. Greg called me to let me know he was going to sell the house. My window of opportunity to finish this documentary is closing every day. Amazing, let me take this, he's selling the house ... I'm in fort sumter right now and I received very bad news, that Greg was selling the house At that moment I realized that I had to go home. THE HOUSE IS SCHEDULED TO BE SOLD IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS I ASKED GREG IF I COULD STAY A COUPLE OF NIGHTS IT GAVE ME 3 DAYS TO FINISH MY DOCUMENTARY. THIS WILL BE MY LAST VISIT TO THE BLACKWELL HOUSE Hello. Day 1 You know, I just realized that when you walk into a scary empty house, you don't want to say hello. Because if someone answers, it's scary, but if nobody answers, it's more scary. The tranquility of this house is terrifying. But I'm here now so I will install this camera or put this camera next to this security camera. Here we go. Just in case, I don't know what to expect from that. So I talked to Greg about two weeks ago and I DIDN'T TELL GREG ABOUT THE TEETH {\ an8} he is currently out of town trying to figure out the new living arrangements of him. So, you know, it's crazy to think that this place It will be on sale soon. And I won't get a chance to come here and try this house as if it were mine and hunt ghosts. That is why I am here. A little sad. So I brought something with me in the big backpack here. Some of you will remember the old ball here I'm going to prepare it as before and see if it moves here. I will prepare it right now If you wonder why I'm talking so energetically it's because i'm really scared right now I'm just trying to calm down So if you remember, in the first documentary I prepared this ball, which ended up finding its way to the top of the well below. So I brought it back and I'm going to put it in the middle. Honestly, I suspect this thing will move at some point because I'm alone and she knows it. So now I'm going to set up some cameras, I think that is the next step to take. I have one installed here, but I have to configure a few more. So in the first documentary I put cameras everywhere, but had some major problems. And not to mention the power went out. And then all of Greg's security cameras went off. I want to show you what happened in the first documentary. So people did not understand this. But this camera here has no battery. And it's just plugged in down there. And so, just when the ball moved in the first documentary the only camera that was on the ball just got cut off. So I had to find a solution for that I think I came up with a pretty good solution, I'll show it to you. These little ones are my babies, I turned some of them to night vision They have an internal battery and can record a ton. But the problem is that the internal battery does not last until between 45 minutes and an hour, I guess. So what I had to do was I have several of these supports that I am going to place around the house And then I have a power cord going down. And the power cord will go all the way here and I plugged it in via an extension cord. If the energy dies for any reason the internal battery of these devices will activate and record� continuously to ensure we never lose power. So I want to point out something that a critic really noticed. after seeing the first documentary I did not notice it myself, but it is very strange, apparently have a lock on a bedroom door And yes, it is. But wait until you see the other side. You have your lock. A normal padlock and then another padlock underneath. And even a room up here. I'm not a genius, that tells me that Greg is a little scared that something enters through that door because those are 4 locks. Yes, I know how to count. I think Greg was afraid someone was going to break in here. All right, we'll install our first cameras here. I want to put one right here because I think that walking around the door there is going to get some attention. that should be fine. Oh, I forgot. I forgot to show you something. I have, oh, this is going to be exciting. So Nancy, the 92-year-old lady who sent me that care package if you remember, he sent me a record who said he needed a special player to play it, also known as a turntable. So I brought one with me. So this is going to be like the ball on the table. You know I'm going to put it here and it will have power, the turntable will be ready to work. And if you want to hear your favorite song, all you have what to do is press a button and it will start to sound. So that's what I'm going to do, I'll set up the turntable. I got the power cord, I'll plug it in quickly. Okay, let's try this. It's been 15 real years since I played a record of whatever I had an old Mickey Mouse record player when I was a kid I really don't know what I'm doing. Oh it's spinning You know, I could have guessed that it would probably be creepy music It had to be creepy music right? All you have to do is turn this thing on. I'm going to put the needle in, the needle is ready. Now all you have to do is turn it on and play your favorite song. I did that for you if you're listening. All right, we have everything ready, the ball, the record player. Now all we have to do is relax and waste time. I don't know what that was but it has started he's letting me know he's here. I asked myself why not sleep in the part of the house that is livingroom. Fortunately, I have all the lights on here, So I feel a little less scared to death my heart rate is a little high right now. I am not going to lie but as long as I keep talking to you. I think it will be fine. I have noticed a lot more activity and I think it is mainly because you know I'm alone this time it's just a little coincidence that I am alone now and I am seeing much more or hearing many more things, should say. But I have noticed that when I provoke her to make a noise of some kind she don't, she never does it on demand, it's more when am i setting up a camera or i'm busy with something I hear a noise. and that tells me that if you provoke this ghost, She won't do anything, she won't do it when ordered It's almost like you have to not be ready for that. So now I'll take you around the house and show you some of these cameras I set up. I have some night vision lights to help night vision cameras. I'll show you what it's about You can't see anything but it's actually an infrared light that will help. illuminating some of these night vision cameras that you set up I will show it so you can probably see that my eyes are really strange and I have this light right here in front I can't see it, but it's actually infrared light. So we have everything, I officially have all the cameras filming the house. Sorry I look like shit, it's because I have night vision on But yes, I have all the cameras recording. We have night vision. Lights assist night vision cameras I have a dream, I think I will fall asleep very soon not much is happening, actually I thought that more things were going to happen but it is not like that. I'll just go around I think I'll move to the bigger sofa. It's like 1:30 in the morning, nothing has happened I have not heard noise it's really weird, now i'm not scared but I'm going to turn off one of these lights here. I'm going to try to get some sleep good morning It was a long night, I didn't sleep much but something happened last night. I don't know what or why but I went into the kitchen and these chairs were all scattered. as you can see these chairs are scattered these two have fallen and I look at the camera that was in this section and sure enough, is still filming so we got it. I'm going to get that recording right now and take a look at it Oh Found the section, I can't believe I just saw it but I loaded it and now I'm going to play it I have to see her again. Oh my gosh wow this happened at 2:37 a.m. ok so when i go until 2:37 a.m. right there and then a few seconds later the chairs ... wow so there are other cameras recording during this so I took another couple of cameras and you can really hear them. they can hear the two chairs fall first and then they can hear the other two gliding. And I have another camera angle here for you. And you can hear them on this one too. it's crazy. this is good. I'll take this. This is a good start. Now a lot of people are going to say that this is false and you know what? I understand. But for me right now this is a very good thing. I really don't know what to say if you haven't noticed. So tonight, I have two more nights in this place and tonight I'm going to do the same. The same teams everywhere, the same cameras and the good thing is that everything seemed to work quite well. So let's do the same setup tonight and we hope more will happen, but I'll take this. this is good stuff. I'll cut the cameras, cut had a bad first night other than the fact they couldn't sleep. So we have everything ... Yes, it's recording. So tonight we put it back into operation all cameras in the house. This is night two. We will do everything we did last night, because it seemed to be working. And we're just going to hope for the best, I guess. Yes, now all the cameras are recording, all I have to do is relax and watch TV. So that's what I'm going to do. It's a fun job, right? It's almost midnight and I haven't heard anything yet. I'm getting a little bored. I remember last night I had what I thought was a dream about this door opening and closing by itself and he wasn't really sure if that happened. So with all my boredom here I went back and watched the recordings right now and confirmed that that door opened and closed I totally totally forgot about that too. So I was glad, I was scared because I realized that in that door behind me something happened You know, that's just one more activity that can be add to list i guess. It's getting late. It's getting late. There is no activity so far tonight. pretty disappointed because it's like 1 a.m. I'm sleeping with the lights on For everyone who thinks I'm a big baby. Sorry to sleep with the lights on again tonight. So I finally got some camera activity last night that I've been waiting for a while The record player worked, I didn't expect to hear ... I've been listening to that all night it's been going on literally all night and it sounds like footsteps like walking and it happens every few minutes and it's like crazy. And last night when the doorbell rang, I really didn't expect it and I just noticed that the ball is gone. I just noticed that the ball is gone. THE BASEMENT DOOR WAS CLOSED WHEN I GET UP I just found i just found this LAST NIGHT IN THE HOUSE When I was a child, I lived in an old house. We had chimes on the back porch that often made noise even though there was no wind. I always wondered why until now. I'm not one of those who normally gets a lump in his throat with goodbyes. However, now that I know my time at the Blackwell house is over. I can't help but feel overwhelmed with nostalgia. A long trip north to see the house for the first time. The emotion that washed over me when I first saw her made me feel like a child again. There must be something special in this house and in the woman who haunts her. Even though he was an evil person who did horrible things. I can't help but think of her as a friend of hers. Later he would show Greg all the activity he captured with the camera. She told me that she had never communicated with anyone like she did with me. And I can't help but think it was because she thought of me the same way as a friend. So I say goodbye to Mrs. Blackwell and the house that changed my life forever. Because for me, this is just the beginning. This recording was recovered after the initial release of "The Blackwell Ghost 2". Therefore, he has been introduced to the I post as one piece. Recording Recovered. The following recording, which was filmed during the making of "The Blackwell Ghost 2" it was thought lost right after filming due to a hard drive failure. A "Data Recovery Service" was hired to try to recover the contents of the hard drive. This is what they recovered. Where we parked All right, we're in the airport courtesy car and we're going to the hospital. Or at least we will try to find it anyway. we're in the courtesy car and while we're talking I'm going to the hospital. And we should be there in about 10 minutes. Hospital where Ruth Blackwell was admitted and later died. {\ an8} Let's see if we can put this in there. Ok we are here We will enter Well, home sweet home, here we are. This is the first time I've been back to this house since we finished filming our movie, "Raccoon Valley." It's funny, it's not really a scary place. It is simply It's creepy, because now I'm here alone. So that makes it extra ... I don't know. But I will install some cameras as I walk. I'm going to put this here, recording as I walk So I'm going to walk, to get acquainted with this house again. How can you, oh, I want to, I want to mention something very quick. this is very interesting. This kitchen here, if you can tell, is a little different. Now everything has been redone. And the reason I did it was because, strangely, it had a short circuit in the stove. and set fire to this whole area. He showed me pictures where everything is black and messy. And it originated with the original stove that was there. And coincidentally, we had the same problem. But ours wasn't a short one because obviously the knobs were turned But it's still strange that something happened to both of us with this stove that used to be here. But all this has been redone. Everything is nice and new. nice, neat. So I'll just walk around and show them the rest of the house. Here is the Strange sound from above {\ an8} And this is, as you can see, this is the room that we are familiar with. And now I'm going to show you the dining room. This is where I got really scared when that chandelier started moving. Pretty nice. Strange sound from above again {\ an8} Here's the camera we're familiar with, filming this Yes, we are back doing the same things we did before Just trying to see if we can see something new this time So the reason I'm here is basically to, I guess I'll show you why I'm here. I'm here to, got a camera on the internet. I will install it in the basement so I can have a live broadcast from my house and see what happens there. So I'll have to open this thing. I've never used it so I have to figure out how to use it. I'm going to put the camera here to make sure you can see me I want to make sure they can see me Oh shit! Okay, here we are, making progress, we have a new remote control camera this thing, if you see anything or any movement there in the basement Strange sound from above again {\ an8} I'll send me some kind of notification saying it got some movement. So we'll go down and see if we can set this up quickly. Well. Here we go. Shit You gotta be fucking with me You know, I didn't anticipate how scared I'd be here alone. Well, there it is. Here's the well. This is where she was standing one night. When she was here alone. I couldn't see anything, and then I discovered on the tape that something was standing here, right here. So there is the well. And it was standing right here. I don't know if there is any meaning at this point. But who knows. now i am going to configure this. So I should let them know, this is fun. Some people will not understand what I am going to say. But I have to clarify this. these pliers here in one of the sockets In the first documentary, I close this thing. And I didn't put those pliers back in and then later when the ball was on top. The tweezers reappeared and people thought they had caught alive. Don't film me putting the pliers back on But the truth is that I did not film myself putting the lid back because it weighed so much. I almost lost a finger So don't worry guys, the pliers are there. I'm going to try to open this camera now and see if I can .. find out how to use it. I think I heard something bear with me, guys. I am trying to open this box. This camera .. That was scary well, like I was saying, you know, I mean .. That scares. Hello? Well that was interesting. I did not.. Maybe she was listening to me. I don't know. Well that was exciting. I'm glad we came now. Leave me uh, God, that's scary. My God, where am I going to put this camera? Maybe we'll hear something else. I have to get out of here In fact I'm a little scared So here's the camera. We have the camera. Hey, let's get out of here. All right, let's hurry. Now I'm freaking out. I must find a place to put this camera. There it is. I'm going to leave it here on this little white thing. And he should always film the old well there. All right, that's our cue to get out of here. Yes, we are going. We're leaving here. Yeah, I don't know what to say now. I'm so scared. I want to get out of here. All right, I have all my things. I'm going to throw these cameras no matter what they are filming, in this box because I want to get out of here ...
