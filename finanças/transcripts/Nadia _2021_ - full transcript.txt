Well, I am... am I, like, eight? Eight, I think. I remember because now, again, because of war and everything we've moved really close to my dad's work. And I remember, like, that he, you know, obviously will go... to a lot of places, but you always come back like, around 8.00pm. And that day, my mom, one thing my mom always has is, like, she has a crazy intuition. And then the clock was like six, seven and then she was getting more nervous. Eight, nine... nothing happened around like, mid... before midnight, the driver came back. He was like, "Yes, I drove him to this place and he... he didn't show up again." I knew my mom was upset and I could read out of her that she was in a bad state of mind and... And then someone told her that, listen, stop this insane search. So he... they had taken her to this, like, desert where, apparently, they used to execute people. And he was shot in the... from the back. The guy who had told us, to my mom was like usually, you can't really find the remainings either because there are so many wild animals and they eat the bodies. And then, you know, slowly, my mom figured out that there's almost, like, no future for... Yeah. Six women, I guess. So, yeah, she made the plans of us to... to find safety somewhere else. So... (Foreign language) - Hello. - Hi, Mom. Hi, my child, how are you? Mommy! I am calling you because I am planning to go to Afghanistan. On December 11th. - It's the only feasible time. - It's not great timing. Yeah I know, but... It stinks and it's not very clean either. You should pick a better time to go there... Yeah. ...when you can at least eat fresh fruit. Don't. Don't think about it. It's not the point. I can't help it. You have to understand some things. It's out of my hands. I don't get to decide when I have the time or not. My schedule is unchanged. So stop saying that. It's not like I'm traveling to have a good time. Dad's medals. I put his medals in a box. There were plenty of his things. His medals, his military suits... I asked if my aunt kept it for me and her daughter told me "We kept them for two years but because we feared the Taliban, everyone ran away. We were told if the Taliban found out we had those military suits they would definitely kill us." So I don't know what my aunt did with them. At some point, she buried the medals. - Where? - I don't think you can find them. I don't know where she put them. I don't even have my cousin's number. My poor aunt died two years ago. So, I don't know. Try to find something that's buried for 20 years. My God, imagine. How sick would that be if I found out my dad's medal? That's been buried for 20 years. You can imagine that. So... So I love when it's sunny. It makes me happy. I'm kidding, they're my teammates. (Foreign language) It's so hard. - Too low. - Yeah. It's over there? All good? - And you? - Everything's fine. I've been focused on possession. You have a tendency to group together. Use the whole pitch. Play wide and play simple. Kadi, that goal you scored you centered the ball initially, you were spontaneous. Nadia, you then redirected to Sarah who was coming in behind. (Foreign language) We... we sit in the car in the middle of the night, drove the entire night. My mom was wearing the burqa. I think we were, like, having something on our heads but not, like, non-burqa stuff. Minivan to Pakistan. They're just... I remember that there was a bit confusion. I think first, you know, when you cross the border to Pakistan is like Peshawar area. And then from there we were in a place called Karachi. We were living in the first floor with, like, nothing, basically. It was just like the floors. We just sleep on the floors. We used to... three days to buy. It was, like, just buy it from... directly from the street just like, you know, you used to buy... What is it called? Meat sauce in a bag. You know, and then you had the little thing that you put it. And then with toast, we just... you see that. I usually... actually love that. Honestly, it taste so good. You know, this human smuggler, I think, is Pakistani he used to tell my mom that "If you wanna have fake passports that would all match with the description of these three of your kids. I can send them to Holland." And my mom was like, "No... We stay together." And then one day, he came and he was like "We found, like, a passport matching you guys. A single female with five kids and obviously Pakistanis. And you have to make sure that you're... they don't discover that you're not Pakistani." We did, as I was told and we followed this guy to the airport sat there, go through the security check without any problems. Yeah. First time on the flight, and then, yeah, we came to Italy and this guy was waiting for us. He probably knew our description. He came and picked us up. I don't know how long we drove. For a while, I guess. And then we were... We went into this... He opened the door to this apartment. The toilet was nasty. Really nasty. My God. Like, the toilet was like... People are... just shite everywhere and there's pee everywhere like, oh, stinking so bad. So I was like, I don't wanna... First of all, I don't wanna lay here because it's dirty. Secondly, I'm just gonna sit in the corner. I'm not gonna eat because then I have to go to the toilet. And then there's a guy came in, same guy and he was, like, "Let's go, let's go." He took the back. We followed him in the car. Sit there. We drove somewhere to this... to this parking spot for trucks, I guess. And then he was telling, "You're gonna run here." And my mom was as confused as we were, like no one knew what was happening. And again, you can't really ask questions about what is happening because these people are criminals in some ways, you know and even though they helped us a lot, but they still look like gangsters. My mom took... had my little sister in her arms. And Getti and I was trying to, like, take the bags and then little two other ones. We helped each other somehow to get inside of the truck. We were told to sit there and don't say anything because if you get discovered, you're gonna get back to prison. We drove for, I don't know, ages. I felt... it was cold. I was hungry. And then, yeah, he opened up the door and he's like, "Get out..." It took us, you know, a bit of time to figure out where we were and walking around and see what's happening. So we were in Denmark. I am going to sign this and you give it to the kids, ok? At some point, when signing my name my handwriting got smaller and smaller. It started out as Nadia Nadim. Then it became N. Nadim. And then Nadim. See? - Now you just do whatever. - I just do an X now. Kidding. He had 48 medals. He kept them in a box. (Foreign language) Will you find them? I gave them a box and asked them to keep it for me because I would come back for it one day. I called my aunt a few years later, when she was still alive to ask if she had kept it. She said she was afraid the Taliban would find it, so she hid it. Where? Well, in one of the rooms. No burkas there at least. If they knew your father was a general they would have persecuted her. Yes, we were conscious of that. Beaten her and made sure her life was hell. - Hi. - Morning. (Foreign language) I brought my brother-in-law along. I'm looking forward to today. - Big crowd. - I hope they have a good day. - I'm sure they will. - Me too. For the first half hour, you'll be with Peter and Jakob practicing your passes and working on your fitness. What's your name? I love that you run all the time! Top-notch. That way you'll never shoot too high. One more time. Yes, good. Follow it! Great, girls. Looking good! Thirty seconds more and then we meet up here. Nice kick. Follow it. Run for it. Hi, Beate. Look wherever, just not straight into the camera. - Could you sign my shirt? - Yes, sure. It's gorgeous. I would like to be someone who instigates change. Are you still an ambassador for the Danish Refugee Council? Yes, and the Football Foundation, UNESCO and "From Street to School". I feel like I have a platform which can take me far... I invest a lot of energy when I have the time which means many of my holidays. But I know that I'm reaching out to people who really need a hand. - Are you taking a break? - One semester. You already did 11? Eleven and 12, yes. I need 10, which is Psychiatry. Right. I read somewhere... plastic surgeon, right? I'd love to do that. Reconstructive plastic surgery. The reason is fairly simple. I find it creative and engaging. Will you join Doctors Without Borders? It's one of my goals. I'd love to do that. - When we was in Pakistan - Yeah. - my dad would sell leather jackets - For real? in the market. - For real ones? - Yeah, yeah. So then they went to Moscow, they started working over there and then we had made enough for my dad to send sort of the family over but not him. We was in London for four years before... before my dad actually came. So my mom and every one of us, we kind of started living a life where he wasn't around anymore. And I remember I used to be young and I used to pray like "Oh, God, please, I just want my dad to come home. I just want my dad to come home." That was like my biggest dream when I was there. So the day when he actually reached home it was like after four years. I was just had this, like, big smile on my face for like six, seven hours. It was like, just cozying up next to him for ages. Say it. Who's your... Just say it, mom, just to make it clear. - Between all your children. - All of them. All of them. My God, who makes your heart happy? You. That's it. I'm your favorite. - Oh, my God. - She said I love all of them but you make my heart happy. - So... - I'm like, indirectly... that means you love me the most. I got you. Yeah, I had some flowers in the living room. Not a single one, not two, lots. You put flowers everywhere. Yes, because I love it. You made us pose? That's not natural. It's staged, right? It looks like it's staged. I'm out. She was too young. Those were interesting times. I want to be with you. But I don't want you to come with me. What would happen if I went alone? Well, you don't know the place, you've forgotten everything. Whereas I have a few contacts, who could help you. But what have I forgotten? Apart from my clothing? It's better that I go with you. May God protect us. May God have mercy on our poor people. I hope this bloody war ends. People need peace. Everyone is exhausted. Yeah. Good times. Well. Pass the ball! - Hello. - Hi, Michael. Nice to meet you. My agent, Michael. As a professional sportsperson who has become a top athlete what's it like to be a woman? You know, of course, I think when you... when you see upon to be an athlete a female athlete, and being the main athlete is so different and there are so many aspects to it. I think, you know, one thing is like building a family. It's obviously really hard because... because it's the... it's the woman who has to get pregnant and be away, you know, like... and then it's so hard for the ones who... I know a lot of athletes who try to be pregnant and then try to come back. And it's always so hard to be in the same level again. So it's... I feel it's... it's hard because sometimes you feel like you have to sacrifice a lot to play football. And also in terms of finances, it's so different, you know because with... the male players, you... Everywhere they go, they have the entire family in touch with them. You know, they have their kids, their wife, family, everyone because they make enough money. I think with the females, it's different. I, like, I don't think that the salaries are there where you can have your entire family and the men is gonna give up their, like, lives to be with you, a house man, you know because there's no really... there's not enough money in it. If you're a full time professional and, you know and playing this level it can easily become really lonely also sometimes, you know because you sacrifice and everything to be a part and running, chasing this ball from everyone. And... I think sometimes people don't see that, you know they always see like, "Oh, yeah, training is fun. You, your... It's so nice for you to travel the world," you know. I think sometimes they forget the sacrifices that you put into it, you know. And I think women sacrifice a lot more than, than men do. I need to clean my apartment like, really clean because my mom was like "What is this?" No, there is, there is two strategies. The first one is to clean everything. The second one is to let them say "Oh, sorry, Mama," and Mama will clean everything. Yeah, no. I just wanna... Marie, are you cold? Marie's ice cold. That must be it. Always. Marie, I like that attitude. It's cool. Okay, down to the river. No, I know, I know. The plan this Christmas is for me to go to Afghanistan. For Christmas? - What do you think? - Well... To me, that seems... tricky, no? It will be tricky. Yes, but that's the only time I have. Afterwards... Is it something you want to do? 100%. I think we need to check in with the club's head of security. We need to talk to him and find out... what the risks are if you go there. We have to be sure it's safe. I mean, it's not safe, but we need to organize things carefully. - Yeah. - Because for the club... It will be the first time in 22 years that I've been back to Afghanistan. But I want to go back to try and find something that belonged to my father. Have you spoken to anyone over there to see how it might work? My mother knows someone who still lives in Afghanistan. But I've never spoken with them. Do other members of your family go there often? - No. - No? Only my mother has been back. Twice since we left. And did she have any problems over there, or was it fine? No. Honestly, it wasn't fine. So when I told my mother that I was going to Afghanistan she wasn't very happy about it. But she understands it's something I want to do. That's all there is to it. We'll just have to see how it goes. You know, I think, it's obviously, it was a mixed... I was really upset that, obviously, I've missed, lost my dad. I think the most... the thing that made me upset was seeing my mom so being, so upset and... but for me, also, it was weird because I feel like almost for six, seven years I didn't believe my dad was dead. I always thought that he's gonna show up one day and I felt almost like, sometimes I used to see him you know, I'd be like, "Oh, did you see this guy?" He was looking like my dad, you know? So I always, always felt that he... I... I saw him. And, you know, at the beginning, that was what I felt. Later on, I felt like, maybe I'm not gonna see him again. Maybe he has found another family, like, you know, maybe he has left us. That was, you know, my next thing. And then, you know, like again, this feeling of him showing up or me seeing him places, I used to see him a lot of places which was fucking weird. Like, I'll be like, I'm 100% sure. I just saw my dad there. You know, like, I felt like, the time I understood why I was... what was happening it was like when I was writing my book and someone told me this is your way of... they say when you're sorrow or your like, grief, you know you... think you're seeing people. Mom! - Oh, my God. - (Foreign language) (Foreign language) How are you? Mommy! Mommy! Lots of homeless people here. - Really? - Lots of young people. There are a lot of young people from Africa. I think there are many Afghans too. When refugees come here, nobody takes care of them. Yeah, nobody does. No one gives them money, no one gives them an education no one sends them to a refugee camp. So they walk down the streets until they reach other countries. - Yes. They walk down the streets. - How do they cope in winter? They make a fire. They probably can't work here. No, they can't. - Is he drunk? - He's high. Yes, it's a shame. You walk too fast, you've left me behind. Hello, how are you? Mom. Where are you going? I don't know. Yeah, he always did. You've got to be quick! It's a short distance! That's it, give it everything you've got! She told me she's going to Afghanistan. She told me she was going in December. I'm okay with that. Yes, she'll be there for three or four days. Bad timing indeed, but she has a ten-day holiday in December otherwise she won't have time. You weren't cold. It's getting even colder. I thought you froze. No, it just started getting cold. No, stop. No! Are you hungry? I am. Nice. - See you tomorrow. - Yes. - Have a good night. - Good night. Ciao. What does a demain mean? See you tomorrow. Okay. A demain. A demain? - A demain. - A demain. I don't think it's a good idea to come with me. You know nothing. I don't want you to come. It's dangerous. Listen, you don't even remember anyone. Will you try to find your cousins and call them? I will find them. But, first, I will look for Jamshid and I will ask for his number. That's the... other cousin, right? If you ever go to Kabul, who will guarantee your safety? If we don't, who will? The French Embassy? 'Cause they'll go through the Embassy. Let's cross that bridge when we come to it. Because Naqeeb told me "If she wants an armed bodyguard or something like that for her safety, I'll find one." Oh, wow, that's a nice picture. Yeah. (Foreign language) Am I blind? Shit! It's big, right? The crazy loss in Islamic countries or Afghanistan, at least is that if your husband dies your son is gonna inherit it. So if you don't have the son, it's gonna be the brother. So suddenly, one thing is, you have all these crazy people outside running and destroying everything. But on the other hand, you also had people from your own family, my uncles, suddenly wanting to be you know, marrying my mom, you know, wanting to inherit it. Properties, cars, money, everything. 'Cause my dad, as a general, you make a decent living. My mom was working hard as well, you know. And then you have invested in apartments, like, houses and stuff. So, you know, suddenly, there is no way safe for you. So she had to sell the houses and like, make them in her name. So she sold our, you know, properties for no money. Sold her gold, like, jewelries and everything she had and try to be really low profile so she didn't get discovered. And, yeah, one day, middle of the night we were like, "No one's gonna pack anything." I think we had like a sports bag or something like with a bit of clothes important papers, the money that my mom had gathered. And it happened that way. As long as there wasn't war, you know, rockets and anything. Yeah. You're given a second chance, I guess. Do you have cumin? - What? - Cumin? No cumin, but I have turmeric. - You want some? - No. Mom, this is how I usually do it. I'd like to add some ingredients. No, no, thank you. So how do you seal the pot? - This first? - Yes. There is not enough water. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Okay, cool. They buried the medals. They're made of metal, aren't they? They won't deteriorate. I will go if I find the address to the house, the garden, wherever I'll bring a metal detector. I hope they're right about the medals. If they buried them, we'll find them easily. Exactly. I think they sold their house. But if we look for them in the garden and if no one took them out I'll find them, I give you my word. (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) Nadia! - Nadia! Nadia! - Nadia! Nadia! - She took the shot! - She took the shot! - She scored! - She scored! Viva! Viva! - She did it! - She did it! - Stop! - Stop! - This is... - Paris! - This is... - Paris! - This is... - Paris! Open the door. - What's up? - Tony, how are you? - I'm good, and you? Welcome. - Good... Get you, get the rest a bit? Yeah. How was training? - Yeah. Good. - Can you imagine the last page when they open it, and they're standing with the trophy? How sick would that be? - Yes. Yes. - Really... I'm an angel. And I'm a devil. Hey, what kind of devil? You ain't no devil. You want to be the devil. What do you think? My retirement plan. This is like a good idea. - Or you want me to - I mean... continue your morals. So... You need to, you need... this is something you need to feel for yourself. And as you say, all the things that you've been saying, like family. Friends back home. All the things you wanna do. I think that's the most important. And I think that's, you know, sums it up like, okay you, you made peace with retirement. - The house was sold. - Okay. You know the situation in Afghanistan. The house does exist, but we sold it already. Okay. And you said that they built a building over there? Yes, a huge building was built there. It was only us before. Now, there are thirty to forty families living over there. Okay. Do you think that the garden still exists or was something built over it? Sorry, I didn't get the word "garden". I am sorry. It's been a long time. I think I'm losing my Farsi. The garden is the outdoor place where there are trees and things. It's in front of the house... No, everything has changed. Everything is different, it's a new environment. Okay. ...is the word. The garden of the house. Everything's changed. There was a little square that still exists. Since you left, you have never been back to Afghanistan. I only see pictures of you on Facebook. I don't remember your childhood. We were too young when you left. That's right. It would be fantastic if I could come back. I'd love to be able... to return to Afghanistan. Inshallah. Okay. Have a nice day, goodbye. Goodbye. Say hello to your family for me. Today, the targets of the Taliban's and the Islamic States is to focus on the VIP. This is a reason why, during all your trip to Afghanistan we have to take all the measures to be very low profile. - Of course. - Okay. Of course. We will put on the field on the ground all the measure for the escort - Yeah. - for your protections. But all the convoys will have to be very discreet - Yeah. Yeah. - very low profiles. So except your arrival and your... - your... - Departure. Your departure. - And the place in the Serena Hotel. - Yeah. Because we decided to, to go inside the hotel. If it's confirmed doing this, why all the convoys and the transfer from one point to another point - has to be very low profile. - Okay. And we will put on the field all this kind of measure to have all the information before the deployment. - Yeah. - That means when we will go from one point to another point everything will be secure. About the clothes. You are Afghan. And you will have to be dressed as an Afghan. Yeah, not really a fan of that - because I am Afghan. - No. But I've never been fan of this mug, but, yeah. Yes, but you have on a little put your - passion out just on your hair... - Yeah... I know, yeah. not on your face and so on. I bought myself a black one. Black, simple, completely black. Okay. It's nice. And I bought the thinnest one too. In Afghanistan, they wear scarves like this or make it fall behind like that. On TV, they wear it like this. I don't want to wear a hijab. But you can wear a jacket with some trousers and a scarf around your head. We have the same style in Kabul. What happens if you don't wear a scarf? It's the law in Islamic countries, you must wear a scarf. Everyone will stare at you. You have to wear it. I don't want to wear a scarf. You have to. But for my own sake, to avoid people staring at me and so I can feel safe, I will wear it. Arkema Cup Day 16 I told them there was no room for error. That they may well be remembered as the first team to take the title away from Lyon, after 14 years of consecutive wins. Fourteen consecutive titles. And five in the Champions League. We don't need to win, but we can't lose. (Foreign language) (Foreign language) You know what? There's just one left. Just one! - Hey! - Hey! (Foreign language) (Foreign language) What just happened? Lyon just weren't ready for us (Foreign language) What just happened? Lyon just weren't ready for us - This is... - Paris! - This is... - Paris! - This is... - Paris! I remember this really clearly because we were sleeping like in different areas and... middle of the night, like you felt that the... the earth, like, was shaking. The windows was like... like smashed, like... Like, I woke up because of, you know, the... shock of it. Like, as if someone just, like, shook you and everything is, like, shaking and the light. It was like this huge bright light. And... my mom ran into the room, like, you know, like... Screaming, "Get up!" Everyone's just like crawling over the wall and you're hearing like they're like the sounds of the rocket because they weren't hitting one. They used to come in periods, like, you know? Like you could hear it, like, coming and it already hit one and everyone's like, shock and adrenaline's running and we climbed over, running. And went to the basement and waited there until everything like, quiet down. No one's saying anything. Everyone is like, you know, when adrenaline is really running you're shaking, you know, and you're like, awake. So waited there, wait there, until it was, it was silence again for a couple of hours. Went back early in the morning. And I remember that the entire garden was full with dead birds. There were so many, like... I'm telling you, like, probably four or 500 birds. So happy you can come. - Thank you so much. - I heard so much good about you. No. Come on, come on. National team player, Dr. Dale. Really honored, thank you. - Thank you for your time. - You know, we are waiting for you. You will become also a doctor, a surgeon, I hope. - One day. - Very soon, yeah? Yeah. That's the goal, obviously. And we built the first ever cardiac surgery center for children... in Afghanistan. And since then I'm working there as a head of the cardiac surgery. That's pretty cool. One day. One day when I'm done I'll love to come and, like, get some experience, you know. - Promise. - Deal. Before I lost Dad I remember we used to play. When he died we were not allowed to go out anymore. My mother stayed low profile. We kept moving. Sometimes we lived here, sometimes there. Yeah, during the war, it was really difficult like 4,000 rockets a day. Then, when the Taliban were there, we played football because it was the only hobby that everybody had in common. - Sports, huh? - Sports, football. But you had to keep a low profile. Yeah, we had to cover ourselves to play. The games were crowded. - Yeah, 20,000 people. - 20,000? Yeah, so many that when there was a tie and a penalty shoot-out people would go onto the pitch. We had to ask them to leave us some space. It was crowded. People would place bets. Weren't you scared something might happen? No, it was not that dangerous. There was this one time... I saw this video that occurred on a national pitch, I think, where people were... executed. - Sadly, that happened a few time. - A few? Yes, we had a game once, we were warming up when a Taliban pick-up truck showed up. A woman is being executed. She is accused of killing her husband with a hammer. She has seven children and they are present here today. - Salaam. - This is Nadia. Good morning, I am David Martinon, the French Ambassador. Welcome! I am Nadia. Every day, they kill someone. They want to create a climate of fear. They want to keep on pressuring everyone. So, so everyone's scared and, you know... - Listen or obey. - Yeah. Because of fear. Control the masses with fear. Right. - What? That's so... - Yeah. - Yeah, crazy. - Crazy world, huh? That's sad. Didn't tell you what he did for the little girl that was shot at the dusty, busty maternity? - No. - So... Oh, is that recently, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah... - Three months ago. - Yeah... So there was... - horrible terrorist attack - Yeah, I saw that. in Kabul, in the, in the Hazara district of Kabul. - In a maternity. - Yeah. It was launched by Daesh, by the ISKP the Islamic State in, in Khorasan. And they mostly target... She has women, etcetera. And what they did on that day was that they killed women who were delivering babies or who just had delivered babies and even kids were shot. And this little girl, I mean, she was 40... 40 minutes old when the attack started. - Forty. - Forty. - Yeah. Yeah. - And she was shot in the leg. Oh, my God. By a bullet of an AK 47. And her mother died. Her grandmother died. And she was sent to FMIC, to the French medical hospital. And he saved her leg. Yeah, I don't want to sadden you - but the situation - No, it's the reality. - is really bad right now. - Yeah. The situation is, has been bad for a long time, but... You know, it's been three years that... Afghanistan is now on top of the list of the countries that are impacted by terrorism. - Crazy. - That's almost... Fifty percent of every victim of terrorism in the world is Afghan. So you know this blue? - Yeah. - What does it mean? Oh, my God. That's so cool. I love it. I'm going to be wearing this everywhere. I'll be like... So we both, we want to - to give you this. - Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - It's beautiful. - I really appreciate this. Thank you. Oh, I love it. Thanks. That's so cool. Well, I'm going to wear it in my first day in there. Thank you. I felt like after 21 years, I would love to go to see just to remember, like the memories of... Are they still the same thing that I remembered? And also because, you know, this is the country I was born in. And, you know, it's my... my mom, my dad everyone is from there. You know, my... I lost my dad. But I also want to go, kinda connect with him somehow, you know. I want to go back to see and I know you're telling all the stories, you know, that it's dangerous and there's like attack every day, you know? And I think if also they would know who, like, someone like me is coming to the country I think also maybe I'll be a target just because what I stand for in terms of that women should be allowed - to do whatever about... - There is no doubt about that. - I'm sorry. But there is no doubt. - Yeah. You know, like 'cause I think everything that they stand for, I hate it. I detest it. You know, I think it's disgusting and that you cannot, as a women or, being treated like a human being, you know. So for me, knowing that but still have this desire to want to go. You're in Afghanistan right now, near Kabul. I am in Afghanistan. - Kabul. - How's that? Being a prisoner, like always. First of all, the security briefing was sick. We met with this guy who makes sure, like the people of NATO are safe, you know and things like, yeah, you have to wear this armed vest you know, bulletproof vest. I don't know if you're wearing those stuff you're going to be in armed vehicles, you know and we have to train if there's someone who attached a bomb to your car you have seven seconds to jump out of the car. Some way, I was like, "Damn, that's scary." On the other hand, I was like, "Oh, James Bond movie." You know? How... I wanna do this? Oh, you have a gun. Hey, don't, please. Even, you are pointing at me. I'm like, in the camera. Don't shoot me. Don't... don't worry, I'm not gonna shoot. - That's a gun. - This is for our protection. We have to keep this in the room for bomb blasts today. Today only. Imagine. Yeah, it's four places. That's crazy, you know? I mean, even I do not recommend you to come right now because the situation is really not good. Bomb blasts, suicide bombers. These things are happening every day. And so many people are dying. You know, they don't even talk about it on TV. You don't hear it on the news. Most of it, they just hide. But situation is really, really bad right now. And this other thing that, that you just mentioned, you know - they stick bombs into the cars. - Yeah... That's also some... it has become so common so common that it's like out of control. It's crazy. So it's really bad right now. I wouldn't want you to come. You know, for me, it's like, as I said, I'm a prisoner right now. It's been two months. I'm not even allowed to, like, cross the road here. I have to stay inside all the time. And obviously, when you come to Afghanistan you would want to go around. That's the reason I want to come to see some of the stuff. You know, you wouldn't be able to do all that because it's really dangerous. But, you know, for me, it's different. I come here to give people hope, right? I'm here to do the show and then I just stay in my room. But for you, you know, if you come, at least they should spend a few days - and come while... - To see some of the stuff. - the situation's better. - Yeah. You know, it's a bit safe right now. Really. It's, it's not good. I would tell you the same thing. I love you. I miss you. And I'm definitely going to come this summer and see you in Istanbul. If you're not coming to Denmark. Yes, come to Istanbul. Don't come to Afghanistan, please. Not right now. Okay. I already told you that I know the current situation in Afghanistan better. And it's the worst situation ever at the moment. People are killed every day. May God wipe out those who are the cause of this all. - Hi! - Hi! And do this with your arms. Look over there. It's our pose. The one where you are too cool for photos. We'll go there in summer. I think in May, my season ends. Will you come home when your contract ends? - Then you'll come to Denmark? - (Foreign language) My PSG contract ends this summer. - Then you'll come to Denmark? - I don't know. That will be enough. - Enough? - Yeah. I would like to go to the USA Spain, England, Germany... No, that's enough. I want to be done with my semester. Finish your last semester and go find a job in a hospital. Why? Maybe there are other things I want to do. Well, it's where doctors work. (Foreign language) You studied for 11 semesters for what? Fun? Yeah. You have to serve the people, they need it. If only we could help our poor people. Do you remember when this house was built? Fine, thanks. I am in Denmark now. Mom would like to talk to you, like I told you. - Good morning. - How are you? Fine, thanks, and you? I am Hamida, glad to meet you. I heard a lot about you, it's an honor. - So you are not coming to Kabul? - No, I'm not. The French Ambassador, the security and the insurance company told me it's impossible right now. Oh, my god, he's so small. - He had an operation yesterday. - Yesterday. Heart surgery? Nadia, when you come you'll work with us either in this room or that one. She promised us that when she is done with football she will come to Kabul and work with us. Of course, why not? At any rate, she won't play football anymore. She has to work on her future. Before your call, I told her I really wanted to see her help our poor people someday. Love you. I love you. Give me love. Love. Give me love. She wants love! I have turned into a cat. Hush. Sit up straight. Mom, I missed you. Mommy! Hey, Nadia! Muskan! Hey! There you are. Hello, love. What's up? I took a walk with Mom. The boat rocked and Muskan said true Nadia, I do love you What shall we build And where shall we hide? I also find it kind of strange. How can we be so different? How is it possible? Why? There are five of us, all so different. Why is that? With everything from... motivation and how we do stuff to looks and how we react. How feminine one is and how tomboyish another is... It's crazy. I don't get it. (Foreign language) Hey! (Foreign language) I think one thing that is in common for all of us is like you know, I mean, having a strong character all of us, you know. It might be that we are... It looks different the way we dress you know, like express our like, feminine side or masculine side, is so different. If you don't look as close, you wouldn't think we're sisters. And I think for the three of us, the oldest one is something that we got from my dad. And I think this has like spread out to... the youngest also like, I think this tomboyish thing. Getti, is super tomboy, you know like super, super. And Diana is also... I would say, I'm like... I'm super balanced. I feel like I can be super feminine when I have to be dressy, girly, all that. But I can also be like a super macho tomboy when it has to be. But I think the reason is because, yeah once we... we were raised without Dad. Secondly, we had a dad who actually wanted boys, you know. That was like, everyone wants boys in Afghanistan because our first... they continue your name, like, you know your name is gonna go to the next generation with the son, not the daughter. So your bloodline is keeps going. And secondly, the inheritance part like, you inherit everything with a boy. So everyone is like, you know, the old kingdoms. You wanna have a son to have a king. And I think for us, you know, having like... having five daughters and my dad kind of raise us like boys, you know. I think it had more impact on certain than others. Something that feels like, you know, I'll never forget. And I think that's the mindset that he kind of push in us. Getti had a fight with, like, a boy a bit older than her and she had... he had, like, beaten her up so when she came up and was super crying like, really upset. Like, and then my dad got super pissed. I was like, "What? Someone beat you up. Come here." And she was, he was about to, like, lose his shit, you know? And everyone, we knew like when to say something or not to say. I was always in shock looking, "What's gonna happen." He took off his belt and he was like... Take this in your hand. I'll show you how you can get him down even though he's bigger than you. You're gonna go grab it around his head and then you push him down. And then if anything is... if anyone is gonna you know, get involved they're going to deal with me." He took out his... we had, we had a lot of guns in the house. He took out, he's, like, one of them, almost like a sniper. He went to the balcony. He was like, "You go, I got your back and you better fucking do as I told you." Getti went down and we were all watching, you know from the upstairs. What's gonna happen, you know? My mom was like, "What are you doing? They are kids. Come on, come down." She's like, "No... this is not about that." She went down and this guy was like, almost, like, half laughing. And she was, like, crying because she had her belt in the back and she did it. Then she came back and my dad was proud of it. (Foreign language) All they have got, the more I understand how like, how certain people don't see me as a date. Like, how certain group of people would never accept that I have a different skin color. Like, you know. So then I was like, how, am I going to feel differently if I'm in Afghanistan or am I gonna be feeling the same way? So it was like, partially also, this, like, this thing that I wanted to like, this feeling I wanna experience. Is it gonna feel differently there or I'm still going to be an outsider? Anyways, one day I have to, just to see. Just to feel the feeling. So different or it's like, "Oh, it's the same." Fuck's sake, Nadia. Why? You never know. The sun. I love the sun. It makes me happy. Tan me more. The reason we usually work with children and families in France and in Europe is because the families we see these days may have kids that are as young as you were when you fled Afghanistan. We help them. Even if they made something for a living back in Afghanistan and had a normal life their parents were forced to leave Afghanistan because of the war and security issues even if they had a job there, they don't now. In the beginning it was really difficult for them. They lived in tents for a whole month in Aubervilliers. One night, the police came and took them from their tents - and told them to go somewhere else. - Yes. They said they couldn't leave, so the police hit and pushed them. I was in a park. Police made us leave telling us they would take us to a camp. But it was just an excuse to make us move. They took us away... This is France and the French authorities claim they have human rights protection in place. These are the daughters of the woman that we are going to meet. Police shot tear gas at them. You went to Sweden from Afghanistan? Yes, we went to Sweden. Where in Sweden? Next to Vasteras, in a small village. Okay. A village called Norberg. Were you in a camp or were you in a house? In a house. We had accommodation. The kids went to school, but my husband and I stayed at home. There were no classes for us because we did not have any status. We suffered a lot because my oldest daughter could not go to high school and continue her studies because she also lacked any status. She wanted to continue with her plans for the future - so we had to go somewhere else. - Okay. Somewhere where our children... can finish their studies and achieve their goals. We have been waiting for so long but we have not received any status from Sweden. Okay. The kids have just started to learn French here. Yeah. My son goes to school and my daughters have applied. They spoke good enough Swedish. Our two-year-old didn't speak a word of Farsi, but knew Swedish. But here, we have to start over. All of them have their own dreams and goals. Yeah. Through Nimruz province we got to Iran. - It took us eight days. - Okay. Then, we stayed a month in Iran. We crossed the mountains on foot to Turkey. We were starving and thirsty after four days without eating or drinking. We were on the seashore, the sea leading to Greece. (Foreign language) We reached Greece and other countries. I don't remember which ones anymore. All that way on foot? Sometimes on foot, sometimes by car. We walked to reach Turkey, then we took a boat. It was a small one, it measured around 10 meters but there were 50 people on board or possibly even more. We had a lot of problems. We still do. I think this is my style, no? We were ready to lose our life. - But to be... - Take your chances, yeah. Because there you have, you have no chance to be alive. So you have to get something. - Certain death or maybe... - Exactly. You're gonna see what future brings - yeah? - Exactly. So my mom ran with me. I had, like, a bag. My old sister had the little kid. Like, my sister got in. We thought we were going to be in England, you know for, I don't know, 50, 50 something plus hours. Everyone hiding. It was only us. No one else behind the truck. And then you stop that. But you're like, yeah. We made it in England, you know. It was like, yeah, get out. You got out. Everyone, like, I still believe like, you know what? In my brain, it was like 5.00am in the morning and, you know, it's a bit dark in Denmark. It was east... Eastern morning, so it's like a holiday. And, yeah, I was like, Big Ben. No, it's not here. London, right? It's not here. But my mom finds a guy who was walking his dog and she was like, where were we? And this girl was like, yeah, Aganas. I'm like, where in England is that? It's not England, it's Denmark. Yeah. So from there, you know, you go to the asylum put police asylum, refugee camp and it just like took off. And I was, again, we were grateful, even though it wasn't England we're grateful that we were together and safe and having gotten second chance, you know. If you had the message to send to your mom today. What would you say to your mom? I love my mom. I'll take a bullet for her because... I think our twenties, you know, easily got married. And she's a gorgeous lady. She sacrificed everything for us. And I just say that I'm grateful, you know, what she's done now. We never forget it. And I'm always gonna take care of her. So, yeah. And... yeah, she, I think she was... She made us the way we are. (Foreign language) And now, I'm gonna eat. My God. You made me cry, you made me cry. That's the... that's the main goal. I wanna touch each other's hearts. Yeah, I guess so. Goodbye. You're making us cry also. Yeah. Yeah. It's the way it is. It could be worse. I could be ugly. No. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah, definitely think one of the reason I wanted to go back to Afghanistan was because of me, you know, trying to find closure because I am the daughter of my father. You know, like I am her, his... genes are in me. Like, you know, I think... It's not that it has stopped my life. It hasn't, in no way it has. It's not because it makes me not sleep... because I sleep really well. But it just will be nice to, like, you know... to, like, say properly goodbye. But it is what it is. Could be worse. You remember what happened last time we played basketball? Yeah. I whupped your ass. You didn't do shit. You wanna do that thing. Air ball! I'm going. I got you in. I took you out. And I really hope that the trip happens one day, you know - when it gets a bit safer. - Yeah, it has to. And I really... I don't know, yeah, I really wanna go. So, you know, after football you will have a totally different schedule. You can run your life in another - way than you do now. - I'm don't think I'm gonna have more time, honestly. I think is going to have less time. No, but you can plan your time. - With all the, oh, yeah... - You can plan it. Because it's my... it's gonna be my schedule. Exactly. You can plan it better. So, I mean, now you're bound by the schedule of your club and by the national team. After football, you can... You can make your own schedule. - Yeah. - Basically. And it's gonna give you time when it's more secure to go. You're right. - Yeah. - Okay. We do it. - Do it... - Let's go. No. Good job. Good job, Tony. - Let's go, man. - Let's go. - Before it gets too dark. - Here. Come on. Hit it. Hit it. No, that's, that's the... (Foreign language) (Foreign language) - This is... - Paris! Around nine when I came to Denmark. Refugee camp. That's where we started. I think it's kind of fate. So for me, the field was just beside the camp. From nine to one. We were in school trying to learn Danish and then from one to midnight we were outside. When we discovered that, beside the camp those like these amazing football fields with the fields to go, everything's just perfect. Just the only thing that was dividing the camp and the fields was like a fence. After school we used to go and watch it from behind the fences watch other kids play. First time I saw a girls team play football and I was like... You know, when you kind of feel the moment. I think that was the... the spark, you know, like, a month or two later I went and asked the coach. We didn't speak the language. We just... I just wanted to be a part of whatever they were doing. And he knew what we wanted. And he was like, "Yeah, come, come." And from then on, it was just obsession. My life has been so crazy. I've experienced so much. It feels like, you know, seven or eight lifetimes already and I'm only 33 years old. But it's... I don't know. I kind of like it, you know I haven't had a boring life. It's been a... it's been... it's been like a bit drama, a bit action a bit romance here and there. It's been a sick movie. I'm not gonna lie. So, yeah, it's crazy. I can't believe it. I don't even believe it sometimes myself. I'm like, damn, man. Is the rest, the next 30 is all gonna be that intense also? I hope not that intense. I hope intense, but not that intense, bro. That's just too much. I'm like, why me? Why? Why? Por que? My God! I'm like, "Bro, I had enough. Come on, man, give me a break. I know you like me, but this is a bit too much."
