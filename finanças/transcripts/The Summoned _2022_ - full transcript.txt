(bright music) (logo twinkles) (ominous music) (whispering) (eerie music) (guillotine whooshes) (Guillotine giggles) (foreboding music) (waves lapping) (owl hooting) (dirt rustling) (ominous music) (gentle chilling music) [Elijah] To Joplyn Rose and guest. That's my favorite part by the way. [Lyn] (chuckles) Okay. [Elijah] And guest. The estimable Dr. Justus Frost summons you to join him at the Staufen House. I've never been summoned to therapy before. [Lyn] Well, that's because the Staufen House isn't just therapy. It's actually a- [Elijah] Exclusive mental health program designed to set you free. Yeah, it says it on the back. [Lyn] It's a really big deal, okay? All the famouses swear by it. There's like a two year waiting list to even get into this shit. [Elijah] Of course, of course. Hey, I've read about this Frost guy, by the way. [Lyn] Yeah. What'd you read? That he's super strange, that his patients are sworn to secrecy, that... [Lyn] Okay, well, I can tell you that he has changed people's lives, okay? People that I know. He's eccentric, but it works. I'm just saying the coupon was a much better gift than you're giving me credit for. And I'm just saying, it sounds like some white people shit. [Lyn] Well, no argument there. (pop ballad plays) [Elijah] Uh-oh. Oh, hold on now (laughs). [Lyn] All right, you don't have to do this every time. [Elijah] I'm proud of you. [Lyn] You know I've had my songs on the radio since I was like 14, right? [Elijah] Lyn, look, I'm excited about the new album. Babe, these songs, I don't know, they feel special. [Lyn] Yeah, they always do. [Elijah] Hey wait, stop. Pull over. [Lyn] What? Why? They might need help? No, Elijah. Not our help. Lyn. Lyn, come on. Lyn. Oh my God. Okay. Okay. Fine. (sighs) This doesn't look ominous at all. I'll be right back. (crows squawking) Hello? Anyone here? (insect buzzing) (dramatic music) Oh. Hey man, you need a hand? Looks like you're having a little bit of trouble. Cool. Cool. Well, sorry to bother you. Hey come on- Where are you going? Is everything okay? I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Who the fuck was that guy? No fucking clue. Come on, let's get outta here. Jesus. (mysterious music) Whoa, is that it? [Lyn] That's it. [Elijah] Damn. Look at this place. Ooh. Sexy-ass car too. [Lyn] (laughs) [Elijah] What? [Lyn] (scoffs) I offered to get you anything you want for Christmas. "I don't know, just gimme some coupons or something." [Elijah] Well, I wasn't going to ask you to buy me a car. [Lyn] Why not? [Elijah] Because I can buy my own damn car. [Lyn] (sighs) ...and plus, I love the coupons. Okay. You ready? Let's go. All right. (suspenseful music) Holy shit. Lyn? Joe? No way. I haven't seen you since what? New York? Yeah, it was one of those ridiculous launch parties of yours. It wasn't a launch, it was an IPO. Oh I'm so sorry, an IPO. Yeah. I made a lot of money on that one. Mm-hmm. How are you? I mean, aside from knocking out platinum records every year. I'm good. Yeah. Working on the next one as we speak. What are you in for? Well, I got divorced again this year. Oh, I'm so sorry. Nah, it's fine. It's the fourth one. Getting pretty good at it by now. (both chuckle) Nah, I thought maybe it was time I did some work on myself, so... Plus I was summoned. Well, can't say no to that can you? Nope. What about you? Oh, I'm just trying to be less broken so I don't lose this one. Ah, there's really no risk of that. Hey man, Joe Agrippa. Oh shit, yeah. No, I knew I recognized you. Lyn just gave me your book for my birthday. Wow. You're like real-life "Iron Man" or something. Well... I didn't know you knew him. Oh yeah. Elijah, I kind of know Joe Agrippa. It's nice to meet you too, man. What do you do? Oh, nothing fancy. I'm a mechanic. I run my granddad's shop. He's actually an amazing musician as well. Oh, really? Anything I've heard? No. God, no, no. I tried for a little bit and didn't have whatever it takes I guess... Which is fine, I'm happy running the shop. Hey, there's nothing wrong with being a small business owner. That's how I started and now I own three planes. You never know what can happen. In fact, I may have something for you. Yeah, let's talk later. Wow. Really? I mean, yeah, okay. I'd love that. Good. How are you Lyn? I'm good. Did I mention you look great? [Lyn] Oh I don't think you did. [Joe] Well, you really do. [Lyn] Do what? [Joe] Look great. Why, thank you. The secret is crushing self doubt. (chuckles) You're a lucky man. Better lock that up soon. Oh, I'm definitely trying. (gravel crunches) Of course, a limo. Oh, you're fine. Here we are bitches. The Staufen House. Oh my God. I have been waiting to be summoned here for honestly like forever. I just can't wait to get like, grounded and just like, discover my inner goddess, you know? Whoa, is that Tara Grandier? I think it is. Oh shit, it's my therapy buddies. Hey kids, smile for the camera! Fuck. Why the fuck are you here? To get over the shit you put me through. - Fuck you. - Fuck you back. I'd rather deep-throat a fucking harpoon. Have at it. Oh shit. Joplyn Rose. I am such a huge fan of your music. Oh come on, just call me Lyn. Ah, girl. That last single about being stuck in something like, I don't know, like honey or...? Yeah it was a murder ballad about being stuck in honey. Yes. I loved it. It's like something, something I'm stuck in honey... I literally never say the word honey. I, I'm sorry Miss Grandier. I don't mean to make this weird, but like a month, like a month ago, a month ago, Lyn showed me a bunch of your movies. Wow. Ah man. I'm sorry. I'm geeking. I, I just cannot believe I'm meeting Tara Grandier. Sweetie, sweetie. Don't apologize. I love meeting my fans. What was your favorite movie? Oh, well I, I loved "Paganini." Oh yeah. The one where I show my tits. Real cool dude. No, no. I, I'm, I'm sorry ma'am, miss. I, I'm not... you're acting is what I was... I'm just fucking with you. I'm so glad you liked it (chuckles). Where do I know you from? You ever get your brakes checked? What do you mean? Were you in like, a car movie or something? No, I'm a mechanic. Oh, can you imagine (chuckles)? No, that's actually what I do. Elijah and I are dating. Oh. Oh, okay. That makes sense. No, see, I just, I've been waiting so long to, you know, come here and it'd be kind of bullshit if you, that's all I'm saying. Right. No, yeah. It's all thanks to Lyn. We are here to work on some of our stuff. He is such a button. I just love him so much. Oh, thank you. All right bitches, let's go change our motherfucking lives. I'm not fucking you this time no matter how much you beg. (Joe exhales) (playful music) I didn't think wife number two would be at therapy, but why not? Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. They're just so famous. This's your last chance to turn around and go get a burger. No, no. No, it's gonna be awesome. Let's do it. All right. (Elijah exhales) Good taste. How many times a day do you jerk off to your own book? As many times as I need to. Hmm. Hey, that book really helped me actually. You see, he's already more supportive in 10 minutes than you were in our entire marriage. Oh cool. Maybe you should cheat on him too. Is this gonna be like a whole weekend thing with you guys? Probably. (gentle foreboding music) Modern art bullshit. Never really understood it. What part helped you? Of the book, I mean. Oh, I know it's weird, but I actually love the story behind the title, the guy who tricked the Devil. The guy who tricked the Devil? [Joe] (scoffs) I wrote it while we were together and she never even read it. His name was Wagner, right? He made a deal with the Devil. He'd trade his soul in exchange for having his boots filled with gold every week but then he cut the bottoms off the boots so they couldn't get full. The Devil couldn't fulfill his side of the bargain. So he couldn't take Wagner's soul. Hmm. Whoever wrote that is a terrible writer and should probably kill himself. I didn't make it up. It's a legend you idiot. Kind of a strange choice. Writing a self-help book about Satan. Well, people say don't make a deal with the Devil. I say, fuck the Devil. Be smarter than him, be crueler, be meaner, make the deal, just win it. You know what I mean? I think so. Yeah. So Lyn, didn't you- I, I was just gonna say you guys should get together at some point this weekend and chat about business. Maybe you can get a car like his after all. (light ominous music) All right bitches. If I gotta be stuck with my ex for three days, we're gonna motherfucking drink. (glasses clink) Friends, visitors, esteemed guests. Welcome to the Staufen House. I am your host and guide Dr. Justus Frost and over the next three days, we will embark upon a journey that will alter what is possible for you and your lives within each of you. We will create a new realm of possibility. One wit, one atom, one scintilla at a time until you will finally discover your true potential. Please, come, join me. I will show you to your rooms. (ethereal music) Do not love the world, for everything in the world, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, lives not in the father, but in the world. That was John, in 2:16. It's rather poorly written if you ask me. From birth, humans are conditioned to believe that our desires, our wants, our needs, our very existence is somehow corrupt. We are baptized in shame and in shame we live. Cowering from the monsters of our own desires. But as we creep cautiously through our lives, trying to be good, those who do not, flourish. Do not love the world, the Bible tells us. To love it is to sin. To sin. Is there anything more damaging than the false idea of sin? While here you will be unshackled from your doubts, your guilt, your self-loathing. And you will find out who it is you truly are. We have a lot of work to do. Your room is through there. Miss Grandier, yours is there, Mr. Agrippa, Miss Rose, yours are below. Please, get comfortable. I will call when the festivities begin. I, I prefer to stay with Lyn actually. I'm afraid not. We are doing hard emotional work, Mr. Moulton. We must be given time to process in solitude. Come, follow me. Don't worry, babe. I'll sneak up in a bit. (Tara chuckles) Hey, can I ask you a question? What do you think of my tits? I'm sorry? In the movie. Oh, they were... very nice. But like if you were to put a number on them. - A number? - Yeah. - A number. - Yeah. A number. Nine? and half? (Tara scoffs) Or, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm a little uncomfortable, I'm with Lyn, so... Oh, I know. Oh, (chuckles) oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Why are you two here together though? We're just, you know, working on some issues. Not even issues, really. Just- Oh, she wants to fuck other people. No. No, nothing, nothing like that. We, I wanna get married, you know, have a family, the whole thing and she's having some difficulty with that. Oh sweetie, she's a fucking rock star. Well, we've been together for two years. Two years? Yeah. I've never read about you in the trades or anything. Yeah you know, she's really private about us, so. Okay. Well I guess this weekend it'll be a good test, huh? Yeah, I guess. Test? Oh, I mean, Joe Agrippa, he's got a bit of a reputation. I would know. He's gonna try and fuck her. (ominous music) Hey, don't worry about it. If you need anything, I'm right across the hall. (zipper unzips) (pensive music) (Elijah sighs) (Elijah tuts) (Elijah sighs) (wind whistling) (Elijah's tongue clicks) (wind gently gusts) (suspenseful music) (elevator bell dings) (object thuds) (suspenseful music builds) (discordant music) (elevator clunks) (elevator whirs) (elevator thuds) (inaudible voices) (voices droning) (muffled speech) You don't understand. If this doesn't work, it'll be the end of me. (Loud whoosh) (howling wind) Hey. Hey! Wait. (twigs snapping) (shovel thudding) (dirt rustling) No no no. You've had years. We had a plan, We've already he made a promise to him. If we fail, we are doomed. Do you understand? You will do as we planned. (glass shatters) (Elijah gasps) (wound squelches) (Elijah winces) (dramatic music) I do not like little lambs skipping about my halls, listening to my secrets. You're not ready yet. But you will be brought to slaughter soon enough. (Elijah panting) Hey, hey, whoa. Lyn. You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hmm. I was texting you, knocking on the door. Kind of got me worried about you. Sorry. I must have passed out. Okay, well, Frost wants us to meet downstairs. It's like 3:00 AM. Mm-hm. A lovely fireside chat is what he said. All right. - Yeah? - See you down there. - Yeah? - Yeah. You sure you're okay? Frost gives me the creeps. Listen, if it gets any weirder, we just dip out. Cool. - Put that on. - What? What is this? (ominous music) [Tara] Well, maybe if you followed the fucking script instead of fucking improvising you... [Lyn] Hey. Hey. What are you guys talking about? Just some bitches who cost me an Oscar because they decided to go off script on the day of shooting. Did you sleep well Mr. Moulton? Fine, thanks. Good. Please sit. Enjoy the beverage by the fire. (owls hooting) Historically, the night was a particularly difficult time for humanity. It was in the middle of the night that my mother drowned me. That's who she was. Question is, who are you? Drowned you? Indeed. And? And now I am no longer drowned. The lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and the pride of life. The three great sins within which all others reside. Touch no one, want nothing and do not under any circumstances take pride in yourself. I would like each of you to focus on your own sin and then if you wish, share it with us. (Tara chuckles) Okay. Okay. I love my shit. I love my planes, I love my boats, I love my cars. I just fucking love being rich. Probably too much. - Definitely too much. Yes. "The Lust of Eyes". To enjoy the things you have, but then to want more. This we are told is some kind of cruel immoral failure. Oh...(chuckles). If, If I could, I would marry cocaine and Vicodin and ice cream and pizza and sushi and cocaine and, and cocaine. You said that one. And sex. I guess that's bad. Yes. Enjoy nothing. Want nothing. Cage yourself in purity. "The Lust of The Flesh". Thank you, Miss Grandier. Miss Rose, any sins you wish to discuss? I think I'm good. (Joe scoffs) Are you sure? Mm-hm. There's nothing at all? No. Okay. She's not ready yet. It's perfectly acceptable. Mr. Moulton? I don't know. I try to live morally, I guess. Elijah fancies himself as somewhat of a hero. Not a hero. I wonder if Miss Rose, you would give us the pleasure of playing one of your songs. Music is the great lubricant. It can often take us to places we refuse to go ourselves. Perhaps some music will help you and Mr. Moulton dig deeper. Yeah, sure. No. Wait, wait. Didn't you say you were a musician? No. Not really. Oh, well I wanna hear you play. No, no. I think it makes much more sense to hear Joplyn Rose sing than the guy dating her. Come on Rick, have some balls. Take a risk. His name is Elijah, you jack-ass. Sorry, Elijah. "The Pride of Life". Arrogance, boasting, showmanship. Is that the sin you've been taught to fear most Mr. Moulton? A little, I guess. Let's do your song. No, I don't, I don't think they wanna- Yeah, play. Yeah, Come on. Come on. [Joe] Come on dude. Just play it. [Tara] All right. Woo! All right. Why not? Why not?

Jesus Tara. (exhales) Anybody sounds good when they get to sing with Lyn. You cannot accept that you are talented, Mr. Moulton. Well no, I can, I... Just say it. Say what? [Joe] Say you're a good musician. I'm a good musician. Aw, come on. Mean it. I do. Really? [Frost] The pride of life. Anybody else feeling a little weird? A sin only to those who wish to fail. Okay, fine. It's a good song. You can do better than that, Mr. Moulton. It's a really good song? Oh, come on, dude. Own your shit Fine. It's a great song. I wrote a great song. The best one I've ever written. It should be on Lyn's next album. It's good enough. Better than some of the stuff you do now. (owl hoots) No, go ahead. Oh shit, there it is. I offered to record it with you. No, Lyn, you didn't offer as much as say it was the kind of song that could be on the album. Well, you didn't ask either. I didn't want to take advantage. We've been dating for two years, Elijah, if you can't talk to me about this kind of shit, I don't even know what the fuck we're doing. Oh, so I can ride your coattails to fame, but the minute I talk about marriage, you... Oh, you're gonna do that now? You're gonna do that now? - Yeah. Right now, that's what you wanna do? That's why we're here, isn't it? I don't wanna talk about our relationship in front of strangers at three o'clock in the fucking morning. You don't wanna talk about our relationship ever. Not in front of strangers, not with me. You're so scared of accidentally committing to me that you don't say- - You know what? I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed. No... Come... Damn it. Come on Lyn. We are here to grow, Mr. Moulton. Let her have her time, without the ever present specter of you. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Hey, I, I'll go talk to her, all right? Good work. (ominous music) Well, I guess therapy is over. I don't trust that guy. Something is off about him. Yeah. He's probably a con artist. They all are. Hey, hey. You don't look too good. Want to talk upstairs? Yes. Come on. (crickets chirping) What do you want for yourself, Elijah? God, I feel like I'm the only one getting therapy here. (chuckles) Just making conversation. Consider this our business talk. I don't know. I, I do wish I could have been a musician. You know the difference between you and Lyn? (scoffs) Talent. Money. Her whole family's crazy rich. She could try and fail for as long as she wants. She doesn't have to worry about anything. Her life will never be uncomfortable. I'm guessing you didn't have that luxury. I didn't either. So how'd you do it? I cheated the Devil. Huh. Elijah, I got a proposition for you. I need to put some money into something, quickly. And I'll be upfront, it's not exactly legal, but hey, anything's legal if you don't get caught. I'm sorry. I, I just need a, I need a second. Let me invest in you. Invest in? What do you mean? I could buy your little car business for two, two and a half million. I don't, I don't understand. Why, why would you do that? Because I like you. I think you're talented. I don't know man. I saw you looking at my car. You like it? You can have it. Part of the deal. I don't want to get mixed up into anything. Okay. Hero complex, I get it. But just so you know, no one will know and it's fucking two and a half million. Can I talk to Lyn first? Sure. Attaboy. Get some rest. You look like shit. (slow foreboding music) (elevator rattling) (elevator clunks) (shovel thuds) (woman screaming) What part helped you? (shovel thuds) (dirt clattering) (Elijah gasps) (Elijah groans) (Elijah inhales sharply) Lyn? Hey Tara, have you seen Lyn? Uh, yes. She and Joe went to go get alcohol. I'm gonna go find them. Hey, are you okay? No, No. I'm pretty fucked up actually. I've been having weird dreams and last night- You passed out, yeah. Joe and I found you outside. I don't know what the hell that was. When Joe was cheating on me, I was a total mess. It's amazing what anxiety can do to you. Lyn is not cheating on me. No, I know. I'm just saying that, that if you need to talk. Thanks I, thank you. Did she say when they would be- when they uh... Where's Frost? Exploring the three great sins wherein all other sins reside. Hey, since everyone's gone, you wanna hang out with me? (ominous music) No, thanks. (Tara chuckles) (branch breaks) (dramatic music) Hey! Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't stop it. You can't stop it. Wait. (eerie music) (car engine puttering) (brakes squeaking) (car engine turns off) (car door opens) What are you doing out here? Just a, nature walk. Is everything okay? I uh, wish you would've told me you left. Well, you kind of disappeared. Thought you didn't wanna see me. Of course I wanna see you. Yeah. I'm sorry about earlier- Hey, fun drive right? Oh. Yeah, yeah. It was, it was great. Thanks again. No problem. Hey, feeling better man? Not really. Ah, that's too bad. Oh hey, I told Lyn about the deal. She's excited. Actually, I don't think I was thinking clearly earlier. Oh yeah? Yeah. Hey, hey, second thoughts are totally natural. But you should know I already have someone else interested. Really? Yeah. Just called him a little while ago. So if you're sure you don't want it, I'm gonna go ahead and call- I really appreciate the offer, I just... Okay, okay. No pressure. I just wanted to help. You wanna beer? Hmm, maybe later. I'm gonna go nap. I'll uh, I'll see you in a bit? Yeah, yeah. In a second. Cool. (keys jingle) (slow gentle music) Enjoying your stay so far, Mr. Moulton? I don't think we're gonna stay, actually. No? Not your cup of tea? This is life, Mr. Moulton. You either seize your chances or you linger in mediocrity. You've the world at your fingertips. (brooding music) (door bangs) - Yeah, that's what I mean. But I can't right now. (Joe speaking Spanish) Hey, wait. Hey wait. Hey, wait, Joe. What up? I changed my mind. This is not a good way to start a business relationship. Yeah, I'm sorry, but I wanna do it. I want to. Please. (Joe speaking Spanish) Welcome aboard. You just gotta whole lot richer. Hey, did you also mention something about the car? You're right, I did. (eerie music) (wind gusting) This has been such a crazy day. I'm sorry if I've been acting kind of weird. Just, I feel like I've been losing my mind in the last few hours. (tense music) You know, she's fucking him, right? What the hell? What are you doing here? Did he offer you something? Like a, I don't know, like a deal or money or...? (chuckles) Yeah. Yep. That's what he does to people he screws over to make himself feel better. You're lying. I really wish I was. I really wish this was some kind of weird joke, but I got video. No, no, I can't. I don't, I don't... I'm sorry, Elijah. Tara, please. Hey. I know. I know what it's like, okay? I've been there. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please. I can't. Hey, hey. You deserve happiness too, you know? No, no. Wait. Shh. It'll be our secret. Yeah? (tense music) (Elijah grunting) (audio distorts) (Tara moans) (audio booms) (both moan) (Elijah gasps) (foreboding music) (elevator rattling) (shovel thudding) (Elijah choking) (flesh squelching) (tense music builds) Help me. (Elijah grunting) Shit. (high-strung music) Here we are bitches. The Staufen House. Oh my God. I have been waiting to be summoned here for like, ever. I just, I can't wait to just like get grounded and just like discover my inner goddess, you know? Oh shit, it's my therapy buddies. Hey kids, smile for the camera! Here we are bitches. The Staufen House. Oh my God. I have been waiting to be summoned here for honestly like, forever. I just can't wait to like find my goddess and get grounded, you know? Oh, it's my therapy buddies. Here we are bitches. The Staufen House. Oh, my God, I've been waiting to be summoned here for honestly like, forever. I have been waiting to be summoned here honest- Oh Shit, it's my therapy buddies. Oh, It's my therapy buddies. Ooh, it's my therapy buddies. Hey kids, smile for the camera. Can we not film? Sorry. [Tara] Oh, but we're making memories. Okay. (dramatic music) [Abe] You can't stop it. You can't stop it. Good morning. Put the axe down. Oh sweetie, I can't. See I need it in case you, do that. (axe thuds) Elijah! You know Frost is never gonna let you leave (laughs). Lyn. Lyn. What? Lyn. Elijah, there you are. I've been looking all over for you, man. I thought we should have a talk about our future. Don't you think? I do. [Tara] Ready for round two (laughs)? (elevator dings) (elevator whirs) (elevator clunks) [Frost] How good are you really Mr. Moulton? (Frost cackles) (elevator gears grind) [Frost] The three great sins committed in less than two days (cackles). I fear I cannot let you escape. Our master needs you. We need you. (tense ominous music) (elevator thuds) I haven't been completely honest with you. Lyn, Lyn, what are you...? Please put the knife down. When my grandmother was young, she lost her parents. Alone, poor, nowhere to go. She made a deal. She sold her soul. Tara's great-granddad did the same. And Joe? Well Joe is just a greedy fuck. He sold his own soul at a tech convention in '08, actually. And with it comes fame, success, the works. But when you make a deal with the Devil, Elijah, there are stipulations. The Devil? Every year on a certain day, by a certain time, you are summoned to renew the deal. A sacrifice. Someone pure of heart. And if you fail, or if you refuse then you're sent to hell and the contract falls to your next of kin. No. No, no, no. Hey. Come, come on Lyn. Just... I can't put that on my babies. No. Hey, hey. Look at me. Is this what Frost is telling you? Frost doesn't make the rules. (discordant music) Who are you here to sacrifice? I was ready to let this end with me, Elijah. I was. I just... I don't wanna go to hell. I'm sorry. (laughs) Time to go. No wait. (gun butt thuds) [Joe] I thought you were working this guy. Why did it take so long? [Tara] Did you seriously fall in love with the lamb? You dumb slut. Oh my God, these boots. [Joe] Every year is the same thing with you. Buy some fucking running shoes. [Tara] Fuck you. I like to dress up for things. Can you guys give it a fucking rest? Shut up bitch, you totally dropped the ball this year. Lyn. Please, please don't do this. It's part of the gig, man. It's you or us. You do this every year? Yeah. And it's a whole thing. First we gotta find someone innocent, get them to do the sins, lug their asses to the fucking woods and then sacrifice them. I mean, it's like exhausting. How many people have you killed? You're the 17th. You're murderers. Let me go. Let me go. Relax, relax. Think of it this way. Your dying saves three people. It's simple math. That's true. As long as we all draw blood, one death counts for all of us. Cool, right? You don't have to do this. You don't have to... Lyn, Lyn, Lyn, I bought a ring. Give it a rest, man. I was gonna ask you to marry me after this. [Tara] Fuck, my fucking boots. Please, let me go. What the fuck? Ah! Fuck. In the arm pit, really? (Joe groans) Lyn? [Joe] Lyn, what the fuck are you doing? Ah. You fuck. Run Elijah, run. (groans) Lyn! You're gonna get us fucking killed. Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck - That fucking hurt, you little fucking cunt. Fucking hell. Get up. (tense dramatic music) Damn! (Lyn panting) If you die, you go to hell? That is none of your concern right now. Of course it is. I can't lose you. Okay. You bragged at the fire, that's pride of life. You took Joe's deal? - Yeah. - Lust of eyes. And you fucked Tara? It's fine. We're very good at what we do. Look, you committed the three sins. Now we have to sacrifice you on the altar by midnight. Okay? So you run and you hide. You just have to wait them out. There's gotta be a way out of this for you. There is. (Lyn grunts) Lyn! (axe squelching) No! (Tara grunts) (Tara laughs) Wanna make out? (cackles) Elijah? Elijah? Hey Elijah. Fuck, marry, kill the people you met this weekend. Me personally, I've always wanted to fuck Frost. We are baptized in shame and in shame we live, I mean, tie me up and put that cane to use daddy. Oh shit. You know what I just realized? I fucked you. I married Joe and I killed Lyn. I did it! (chuckles). I completed the game. How many people can actually say that? That's actually pretty cool. Elijah! (chilling music) (branch breaks) (dramatic music) Come with me. (brooding music) What the hell? Why are we back here? Shut the fuck up. Who are you? I was you once. A lamb. You escaped? No, no, no, no. Lyn let me go. And why are you still here? He won't let me leave. He makes me take the bodies after they're done with them. I mark their passing. How long have you been here? Nine years. Nine years. We have to stop them. Yes, exactly. When Lyn let me go, she let me go too early. They found someone else and completed the sacrifice. Not this time. This time you wait, you stall them until the last possible moment and then you shoot yourself. You send them to hell. What? That's your plan? For me to kill myself? It's the only fucking way. Just fucking, just, just, just, get away from me man. [Tara] Elijah!? Oh, fuck. I'm gonna chop an itty-bitty piece of you for every minute of my life your wasting. (dramatic music builds) (engine thrums) Oh shi... (Tara laughs) (engine roars) (engine drones) (ominous music) (brakes whine) (engine idles) (dramatic music) (slow tense music) (brakes whine) What? [Frost] (cackles) Oh, little lamb. I can't let you leave. Not like this. Not until you've heard our offer. Please. Please, don't do this. - Shut the fuck up. I give to you this lamb of God. Please, please. I have kids. Please don't do this. - [Joe] Lyn! - [Tara] Just fucking do it. Please. [Joe] What the fuck? [Tara] You let him go? Are you fucking kidding me?! You can save Lyn from this life of murder, Mr. Moulton. Lyn's dead. [Justus] Not yet. There's still time. How? Your soul. Give him what he wants. Take her place. We need your soul. (Elijah gasps) Lyn? (foreboding music) (elevator rattles) [Lyn] I can't keep doing this Frost. I can't keep killing people every year. It's worse every year. [Frost] I'm afraid you don't have a choice. It's the deal your grandmother made. [Lyn] There's gotta be a way out. [Frost] There is, Wagner. [Lyn] The man who tricked the Devil? That's real? [Frost] Yes, it's real. Wagner Moulton has a descendant. A young man whose soul the Devil would give anything for. [Lyn] Including our freedom? [Frost] Yes. You have to find him, bring him here. Convince him to make the deal. What's his name? You should know. If we fail, our master will not be forgiving. What is his name, Frost? (melancholy music) [Elijah] Loves Lyn, hero complex. Well, here we are again. Oh, we can only die if we don't renew the contract, otherwise it just really hurts. Frost used to be human, you know, hundreds of years ago, but he and a friend summoned up the Devil and that friend was Wagner, who tricked the Devil. Got those shiny boots of gold, he got away with his soul. And in punishment, Frost has been trapped here paying for it ever since. You are the direct descendant of Wagner Moulton, eight generations removed. He's been after the soul of Wagner Moulton descendants ever since he was tricked. He'd do anything for it, including give me and Miss Rose our souls back. Sign the contract and your beloved Lyn is freed from this burden. You didn't bring me here to kill me. You brought me here to trade my soul for yours. I'm so sorry, Elijah. For two years, I worked you. Two years to make sure that you fell in love with me and then I fell in love with you. How fucked up is that? I just thought if you saw what you could have- How could you do this to me? I didn't know what else to do. I just thought there was a way out of this for me. But I realize now that this is exactly what I deserve. I'm so sorry, Elijah. You have to get out of here. You have to get out of here. You goddamn, motherfucking, bitch-ass traitor motherfuckers. We were a team! You didn't even think of cutting us in. If he signs the contract and you and Frost go free, we don't have a lamb. You're fucking killing us. I thought we were friends. Friends? This? You're monsters. You don't deserve to be free. That's it. We're sacrificing this motherfucker right now. We can talk about our relationships later, okay? Either one of you two would've done the same fucking thing. - [Elijah] Hey! You shut the fuck up. - I don't- - Hey! (revolver cocks) You come any fucking closer and I'm gonna fucking shoot myself in the head. Just, wait. It's an hour until midnight. Ain't no way you're finding another sacrifice before then. I die, you die. Elijah, come on. - Relax. - Okay, it's okay. Okay. Okay. [Joe] Easy. Put it, put it down. (intense music) (Abe yelling) [Tara] Elijah! Get back here. (engine thrums) (tires screech) (engine drones) [Lyn] I don't want this anymore. Please. Don't make me do this. Just let me go. [Frost] The way I see it, Mr. Moulton, you have two choices. You can save the love of your life or you can run like a coward - Shut up! [Frost] And let an innocent man die for you. Take her place, Elijah. You want to be a hero? (tires squealing) Here's your chance. Shut up! Shut up! I don't care! I don't fucking care! (Elijah panting) (curious ominous music) (revolver rattles) (Abe whimpers) Shut the fuck up. Why is this taking so fucking long? You do this every fucking year. You wanna do this? Let them go. (Joe laughs) (Tara laughs) You remember, we can't die right? You could die for a little bit. That's enough. [Tara] Ow! Fuck What are you doing here? Untie him. What? Untie him. Are you fucking serious? I just spent 30 minutes doing that shit. Untie him! What the fuck? (Abe whimpers) Okay. Now go home. No, I'm signing the contract. - No. - Yes. I'm not losing you, Lyn. If this is the only way we can be together, then fine. I love you. Elijah, please. You're not changing my mind. I hear we have a deal. You've made the right choice, Mr. Moulton. (knife thuds) Lyn, will you marry me when this is all over? Yeah. Well damn. I guess the therapy worked after all. Your blood, signed on the dotted line. And then you and her are free? [Frost] Indeed. Just under the wire too, huh? You've got minutes left. Yes. Swiftly please. Proceed. I love you Elijah. [Elijah and Lyn] More than you'll ever know. What? And then Tara says, "You're a fucking traitor Lyn." What, what are you? I don't- That's your line, isn't it? "You're a fucking traitor Lyn."? I don't know what you- And then Joe says, "She'll never love you. You'll die alone." I, I don't understand- Stop, please. Stop. Just stop. You knew I would never sell my soul just because you asked me, but I want to be a hero. Right? That's my weakness. So you put on a little show. Got me to think I'm saving you from these monsters. Sacrifice myself for you, but I'm not just saving you, am I Lyn? I'm trading my soul for all of you. You've been working me together this entire time! Dude. Just, just please just... I found your little script in Joe's car. You lose. You're done. It's over. Did you ever really love me, Lyn? Tell me the truth. (Lyn sobs) Yes. Get him! - [Joe] Go! - [Tara] No! (rifle fires) (bodies thud) (ominous music) Your children, your grandchildren. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Elijah, we won't stop until we have y- (whimpers) No, no, please. (flesh squelches) (Frost splutters) [Demonic Voice] This is the last time you fail me. Not like this. (sticks thud) (sorrowful music) (gravel crunching) (electric window whirs) You're Tara's driver, right? Yes, sir. Can you let her know I'm here? Hate to tell you this man, but she's gone. I think her exact words were, "Fuck this therapy bullshit." (chuckles) Of course. Thanks anyways. Mind giving me a lift? My ride left too. (gentle pensive music) So how was your stay? Pretty fucking rough, but I learned a lot. Wrote a whole new album too. I think this one's really gonna hit.
