[dramatic music] Tush, you never tell me. I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. But you will not hear me. If ever I did dream of such a matter, abhor me. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his Lieutenant Off-capped to him, and by the faith of man, I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, Evades them with a bombast circumstance Horribly stuffed with epithets of war. And in conclusion, non suits my mediators. For certes says he, "I have already chose my officer." what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician. One Michael Cassio, a Florentine. A fellow almost damned in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster. Unless the bookish theoric where in the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he, mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership, but he, sir, had the election. And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof of Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds Christian and heathen, must be leed and calmed by debitor and creditor. this counter caster, he in good time must his Lieutenant be, and I, God bless the mark his Moorship's Ancient. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. Why, there's no remedy, 'tis the curse of service. Preferment goes by letter and affection, and not by the old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself whether I in any just term am affined to love the Moor. I would not follow him then. [chuckles] sir, content you. I follow him to serve my turn upon him. We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage, Wears out his time much like his master's ass. For naught but provender, and when he's old, cashiered. Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are, who trimmed in forms and visages of duty, keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them. And when they have lined their coats, do themselves homage, these fellows have some soul, and such a one do I profess myself. For sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago. [chuckles] In following him, I follow but myself. Heaven is my judge, not for love and duty, but seeming so for my peculiar end. For when my outward action, doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern, 'tis not long after I should wear my heart on my sleeve, for daws to peck at. [chuckles] I am not what I am. What a full fortune does the thick lips owe If he can carry't thus? [buffs] Call up her father, rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, Proclaim him in the streets. incense her kinsmen. And though he in a fertile climate dwell, plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy, et throw such chances of vexation on it as it may lose some color. Here is her father's house, I'll call aloud. Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities. [both laugh] What ho, Brabantio, [dog barks] Signor Brabantio, ho. Awake! What ho Brabantio! Thieves, thieves, thieves. Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags. Thieves, thieves. What is the reason of this terrible summons? And what is the matter there? Signor, is all your family within? Are your doors locked? Why, wherefore ask you this? [chuckles] Zounds sir, you're robbed. For shame, put on your gown. Gown? [both chuckle] Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul. Even now, now, very now, an old black ram is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise, awake the snorting citizens with the bell, or else the devil will make a grandsire of you. Arise, I say. What, have you lost your wits? Most reverend signor, do you know my voice? Not I, what are you? My name is Roderigo. The worser welcome. I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors. In honest plainness thou hast heard me say, my daughter is not for thee. And now in madness, being full of supper and distempering draughts, upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet. Sir, sir. But thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee. Patience, good sir. What tells thou me of robbing? This is Venice, my house is not a grange. Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you. Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, you think we are ruffians. You'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse. you'll have your nephews neigh to you, you'll have coursers for cousins, and jennets for Germans. What profane wretch art thou? I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter and the Moor, are now making the beast with two backs. Thou art a villain. You are, [buffs] a Senator. [chuckles] This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo. Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you If't be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly I find it is, that your fair daughter at this odd even and dull watch o'the night, tansported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, to the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor, If this be known to you and your allowance, we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs. But if you know not this, my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe that from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence. Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, I say again hath made a gross revolt, tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself. If she be in her chamber or your house, let loose on me the justice of the state for thus, deluding you. Strike on the tinder, ho. Farewell, for I must leave you. [chuckles] It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be produced as if I stay I shall Against the Moor. For I do know the state. However this may gall him with some check, cannot with safety cast him, for he's embarked With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars which even now stand in act, that for their souls, another of his fathom they have none to lead their business. In which regard though I do hate him as I do hell pains, for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him. Lead to the Sagittary the raised search, and there will I be with him, so farewell. It is too true an evil, gone she is, and what's to come of my despised time is naught but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, where didst thou see her? Oh, unhappy girl. With the Moor say'st thou, who would be a father? How didst thou know 'twas she? she deceives me Past thought. What said she to you? Get more tapers, raise all my kindred. are they married, think you? Truly I think they are. Oh, Heaven! How got she out? Treason of the blood fathers. From hence trust not your daughters' minds by what you see them act. Is there not charms by which the property of youth and maid hood may be abused? Have you not read Roderigo, of some such thing? Yes sir, I have indeed. Call up my brother. Would you had had her Some one way, some another. Do you know where we may apprehend her and the Moor? I think I can discover him, if you please to get good guard and go along with me. Pray you lead on at every house I'll call I may command at most. Get weapons ho! And raise some special officers of night. On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve your pains. [footsteps tapping] Though in the trade of war I have slain men, yet do I hold it very stuff of the conscience to do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times I had thought they have yerked him here under the ribs. Better as it is. Nay, but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor, that with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him, but I pray sir. Are you fast married? For be assured of this, that the Magnifico is much beloved, and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the Duke's. He will divorce you. [chuckles] Or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law, with all his might to enforce it on or more give him cable. Let him do his spite. My services which I have done the signory, shall out tongue his complaints. [groans] 'Tis yet to know which, when I know that boasting is an honor. [chuckles] I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being from men of royal siege, and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that I have reached. For know Iago, but that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the seas' worth. [chuckles] Look what lights come yond. These are the raised father and his friends. You were best go in. Not I, I must be found. My parts, my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? By Janus, I think no. The servants of the Duke and my Lieutenant. The goodness of the night upon you friends. What is the news? The Duke does greet you General, and he requires your haste post haste appearance even on the instant. What is the matter think you? Something from Cyprus, as I may divine. It is a business of some heat. The galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another's heels and many of the consuls raised and met, are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly called for. When not being at your lodging to be found. The senate has sent about three several quests to search you out. It is well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house and go with you. [footsteps leaving] Ancient what makes he here? Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack. If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever. I do not understand. He's married. To who? Married to... Come Captain, will you go? Have with you. Here comes another troop to seek for you. It is Brabantio General, be advised. He comes to bad intent. Holla, stand there. Signor, it is the Moor. Down with him thief! You Roderigo, Come sir, I am for you. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. [sighs] Good signor, you shall more command with years than with your weapons. Thou foul thief. Where hast thou stowed my daughter? Damned as thou art thou hast enchanted her. For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, whether a maid, so tender, fair and happy. So opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation could ever have to incur a general mock, run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou. To fear, not to delight. Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion. I'll have't disputed on! 'Tis probable and palpable to thinking? I therefore apprehend, and do attach thee for an abuser of the world. A practicer of arts inhibited and out of warrant. Lay hold upon him if he do resist, Subdue him at his peril. Hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest. Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter. Where will you that I will go with you to answer this your charge. To prison, till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer. What if I do obey? How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him? 'Tis true, most worthy signor. The Duke's in council, and your noble self I am sure is sent for. How? Duke in council in this time of the night? Bring him away mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own. For if such actions may have passage free, bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. [footsteps tapping] There is no composition in these news that gives them credit. Indeed they are disproportioned. My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. And mine a hundred and forty. But though they jump not on a just accompt. As in these cases where the aim reports it is oft with difference. yet do they all confirm a Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. Nay, it is possible enough to judgment. I do not so secure me in the error, but the main article I do approve in fearful sense. [groans] Now, what's the business? [papers rustle] The Ottomites reverend and gracious, steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes, Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes. How say you by this change? This cannot be, by no assay of reason. Have there unjointed with an after fleet. Aye, so I thought, how many as you guess? Thirty sail. And now they do re-stem their backward course, bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward Cyprus. Signor Montano, your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, and prays you to believe him. It is certain then for Cyprus. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you against the general enemy Ottoman. I did not see you. Welcome gentle signor. We lacked your counsel and your help tonight. So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me. Neither my place nor aught I heard of business, hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care take hold on me. For my particular grief is of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and yet is still itself. Why, What's the matter? My daughter, Oh, my daughter. Dead? Aye, to me. She is abused, stolen from me, and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks. For nature so preposterously to being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, Sans witchcraft could not. Where he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her, the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense, yea though our proper son Stood in your action. Humbly I thank your grace. here is the man this Moor, whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought. We are very sorry for it. What in your own part can you say to this? Nothing, but this is so. Most potent, grave and reverend signors, my very noble and approved good masters, that I have taken away this old man's daughter, It is most true. True, I have married her. The very head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace, for since these arms of mine had seven years' pith till now some nine moons wasted, they have used their dearest action in the tented field, and little of this great world can I speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle. And therefore, little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will, a round unvarnished tale deliver of my whole course of love. What drugs, what charms, what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding I am charged with all, I won his daughter. A maiden never bold. Her spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself and she in spite of nature, of years, of country, credit, everything to fall in love with what she feared to look on. It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect that will confess perfection, so could against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be. I therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful other blood, or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her. To vouch this is no proof. Without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him. I do beseech you. Send for the lady to the Sagittary and let her speak of me before her father. If you do find me foul in her report, the trust, the office I do hold of you not only take away, but let your sentence even fall upon my life. Fetch Desdemona hither. Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place. And till she come, as faithul as to heaven, I do confess the vices of my blood, so justly to your grave ears, I'll present how I did thrive in this fair lady's love and she in mine. Say it, Othello. Her father loved me, oft invited me. Still questioned me the story of my life from year to year the battles, sieges, fortunes that I have passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it. Wherein, I spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hair-breadth scapes in the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history. Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven. It was my hint to speak, such was the process. And of the Cannibals that each other eat, the Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear, would Desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she'd come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which I observing, took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her, a prayer of earnest heart that I would all my pilgrimage dilate, whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively, I did consent. And often did beguile her of her tears when I did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffered. My story being done, She gave me for my pains, a world of sighs. She swore in faith it was strange, it was passing strange. It was pitiful, it was wondrous pitiful. She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished that heaven had made her, such a man. She thanked me, and bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her. Upon this hint, I spake. She loved me for the dangers I had passed, and I loved her that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have used. Here comes the lady, let her witness it. I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio, take up this mangled matter at the best. Men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands. I pray you hear her speak. If she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man. Come hither gentle mistress. Do you perceive in all this company where most you owe obedience? My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty. To you I am bound for life and education. My life and education both do learn me how to respect you. You are the lord of all my duty, I am hither to your daughter. But here's my husband. And so much duty as my mother showed to you, preferring you before her father. So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor, my lord. God bu'y, I have done. Please it your grace on to the state affairs. I had rather to adopt a child than get it. Come hither Moor. I here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favor. When remedies are past, the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended. To mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on. What cannot be preserved when fortune takes, Patience her injury a mockery makes. The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief. He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. So, let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, we lose it not so long as we can smile. He bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears. But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow, which to pay grief must of poor patience borrow. These sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides, are equivocal. Words are words. I never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pieced through the ear. I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state. The Turk, with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a more sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you. You must therefore be content to slabber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition. The tyrant custom, most grave Senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down. I do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake this present war against the Ottomites. Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife, due reference of place and exhibition, with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding. If you please, Be't at her father's. I'll not have it so. Nor I. I would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye. Most gracious Duke, to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear. And let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness. What would you Desdemona? That I did love the Moor, to live with him. My downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued even to the very quality of my lord. I saw Othello's visage in his mind. And to his honor and his valiant parts did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, if I be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war, the rites for why I love him are bereft me. And I a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence. Let me go with him. Let her have your voice. Vouch with me heaven, I therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite, nor to comply with heat. The young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind. And heaven defend your good souls that you think, I will your serious and great business scant for she is with me, no. When light winged toys of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments, that my disports corrupt and taint my business, let housewives make a skillet of my helm, and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation. Be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay, or going. The affair cries haste and speed must answer it, you must hence tonight. Tonight, my lord? This night. With all my heart. At nine in the morning, here we'll meet again. Othello, leave some officer behind, and here shall our commission bring to you, with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you. So please your grace, my Ancient. A man he is of honesty and trust to his conveyance I assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me. Let it be so. Good night to everyone. And noble signor, if virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. Adieu brave Moor, use Desdemona well. Look to her Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father. And may thee. My life upon her faith. Honest Iago, my Desdemona must I leave to thee. I prithee let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage. Come Desdemona. I have but an hour of love, of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee. We must obey the time. Iago. What say'st, thou noble heart? What will I do think'st thou? Why, go to bed and sleep. I will incontinently drown myself. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after it, Why thou silly gentleman? It is silliness to live when to live is a torment. And then we have a prescription to die, when death is our physician. Villainous. I have looked upon the world for four times, seven years. And since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found a man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it. Virtue? A fig. 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives, had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reasons to cool our raging motions. Our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts. Whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion. It cannot be. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend. And I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness. I can never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse. Follow thou these wars. Defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor. Put money in thy purse. Nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her. And thou shalt see an answerable sequestration. Put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerbe as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. Therefore put money in thy purse. [chuckles] If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian may not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell. Thou shalt enjoy her. [chuckles] Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself. It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue? Thou art sure of me, go make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted. Thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure and me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time, which will be delivered Traverse. Go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow Adieu. Where shall we meet i'th' morning? At my lodging. I'll be with thee betimes. Go too, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? What say you? No more of drowning, do you hear? I am changed. Go too, farewell. Provide thy money. I'll sell all my land. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse. For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit. [chuckles] I hate the Moor. And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets he's done my office. I know not if't be true But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well. The better shall my purpose work on him. Cassio's a proper man. let me see now. To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery. How? How? Let's see. After some time to abuse Othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife. He hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected, framed to make women false. The Moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so. And will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are. [chuckles] I have it. It is engendered. Hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. [chuckles] What from the cape can you discern at sea? Nothing at all. It is a high wrought flood. I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail. Me thinks the wind does speak aloud at land. A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements. If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed they are drowned. It is impossible they bear it out. News lads, our wars are done. The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks that their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance on most part of their fleet. How is this true? The ship is here put in, A Veronesa. Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello, Is come on shore. The Moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for Cyprus. I am glad on it. It is a worthy governor. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort touching the Turkish loss. Yet he looks sadly and prays the Moor be safe for they were parted with foul and violent tempest. Pray heaven he be. For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside. As well to see the vessel that's come in, as to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard. Come, let's do so. For every minute is expectancy of more arrivance. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the Moor. Let the heavens give him defence against the elements, for I have lost him on a dangerous sea. Is he well shipped? His bark is stoutly timbered, and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance. Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, stand in bold cure. The town is empty. On the brow o'th' sea stand ranks of people and they cry "A sail!" My hopes do shape him for the Governor. They do discharge their shot of courtesy. Our friends at least. I pray you sir, go forth and give us truth who it is that is arrived. I shall. But, good Lieutenant, is your General wived? Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame. One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener. Now, who has put in? It is one Iago, Ancient to the General. He's had most favourable and happy speed. Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, the guttered rocks and congregated sands, traitors enscarped to clog the guiltless keel, as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures, letting go safely by the divine Desdemona. What is she? She that I spake of, our great Captain's Captain, left in the conduct of the bold Iago, Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts at sennight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, that he may bless this bay with his tall ship, make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, give renewed fire to our extincted spirits, and bring all Cyprus comfort. Behold, the riches of the ship is come on shore. Hail to thee lady, and the grace of heaven before, behind thee and on every hand, Enwheel thee round. I thank you valiant Cassio. What tidings can you tell me of my lord? He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught but that he's well and will be shortly here. But I fear, how lost you company. The great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship. [loud bang] See for the news. Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome mistress. Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, That I extend my manners. 'Tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me, you'd have enough. Alas, she has no speech. I know too much. I find it still when I have list to sleep. Marry before your ladyship I grant. She puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking. You have little cause to say so. Come on, come on. you are pictures out of doors, bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds. Fie upon thee, slanderer. Nay, it is true or else I am a Turk. You rise to play and go to bed to work. You shall not write my praise. No, let me not. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me? Gentle lady, do not put me to it, for I am nothing if not critical. Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour? Aye madam. I am not merry, but I do beguile the thing I am by seeming otherwise. Come, how wouldst thou praise me? I am about it, but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze. It plucks out brains and all. But, my muse labors, and thus she is delivered. If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, the one's for use, the other useth it. Well praised. [laughs] How if she be black and witty? If she be black and thereto have a wit, she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit. Worse and worse. How if fair and foolish? She never yet was foolish that was fair. For even her folly helped her to an heir. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'th' alehouse. Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio, is he not a most profane and liberal counselor? He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar. He takes her by the palm. Aye, well said, whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Aye, smile upon her do. I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers soft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good, well kissed, an excellent courtesy. 'Tis so indeed. Yet again your fingers at your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake. [Trumpet blows] The Moor. I know his trumpet. Let me Lieutenant receive him. Lo, Where comes. [gasps] Oh, my fair warrior. My dear Othello. It gives me wonder great as my content, to see you here before me. My soul's joy. If after every tempest come such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened death, and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas, Olympus-high and duck again as low as hell's from heaven. If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy. For I fear my soul hath her content so absolute, that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate. The heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow. Amen to that, sweet Powers. I cannot speak enough of this content. It stops me here. It is too much of joy. And this, and this, the greatest discords be, that e'er our hearts shall make. You are well tuned now. I'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as I am. News friends, [laughs] Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned. [cheering] How does my old acquaintance of this isle? [laughs] Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus. I have found great love amongst them. My sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote in mine own comforts. I prithee good Iago. Go to the bay and disembark my coffers, bring thou the Master to the citadel, he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect. [laughing] Come Desdemona, [chuckles] Once more, well met at Cyprus. [crowd cheers] Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures, more than is native to them. Listen to me. The Lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him. With him? Why, 'tis not possible. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. Love him still for prating. Let not thy discreet heart, think so. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be again to inflame it and give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor. sympathy in years, manners and beauties. All which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness, will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted, as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does. A knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affections. Why none, why none? A slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages. Though true advantage never present itself. A devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave. And the woman hath found him already. I cannot believe that in her, she's full of most blessed condition. Blessed? Fig's end. The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding. Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that? Yes, that I did, but that was but courtesy. Lechery, by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts Roderigo. When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish. But sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight for your command. I'll lay it upon you. Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister. Well. Sir, he's rash and very sudden in choler, and haply with his truncheon may strike at you. Provoke him that he may. For even out of that will, I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualifications shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. [chuckles] So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires, by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed. Without the which, there were no expectation of our prosperity. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity. I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell. Adieu. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe't. That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit. The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not is of a constant, loving, noble nature. And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona, a most dear husband. Now, I do love her too. Not out of absolute lust. Though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin, But partly led to diet my revenge for that I do suspect the lusty Moor hath leaped into my seat. The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards, and nothing can, or shall content my soul till I am evened with him, wife for wife. Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do if this poor trash of Venice, whom I leash for his quick hunting stand the putting on. I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb, for I fear Cassio with my night cap too. Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, for making him egregiously an ass, and practising upon his peace and quiet even onto madness. [chuckles] 'Tis here, but yet confused. Knavery's plain face is never seen till used. [laughs] [claps hands] Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight. Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop, not to out sport discretion. Iago hath direction what to do. But not withstanding with my personal eye, will I look to it. Iago is most honest. Michael good night. Tomorrow with your earliest, let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love. The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue. That profit's yet to come between me and you. [chuckles] Good night. [all laughing] [men cheering] Iago, we used to thee watch. Not this hour, Lieutenant, 'tis not yet ten o'th' clock. Our General cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona. Who let us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night with her. [group laughing] And she is sport for Jove. She is a most exquisite lady. And I'll warrant her, full of game. Indeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature. What an eye she has. Me thinks it sounds a parley to provocation. [men laughing] An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love. She is indeed perfection. Well, happiness to their sheets. [cheering] Come, Lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish, courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment. They are our friends, but one cup I'll drink for you. I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too. And behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more. What man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it. [laughing] Where are they? Here at the door, I pray you call them in. I'll do it, but it dislikes me. [crowd cheering] If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, he'll be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress' dog. [chuckles] My sick fool Roderigo. Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out. [chuckles] Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottle deep, and he's to watch. [chuckles] Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits, that hold their honors in a wary distance. The very elements of this warlike isle have I tonight flustered with flowing cups, and they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, am I to put our Cassio in some action that may offend the isle, but here they come. If consequence do but approve my dream, My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. [laughing] 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. It is of good faith, a little one not past a pint, as I am a soldier. Some wine ho. [all cheering] ♪ Let me the canakin clink ♪ ♪ And let me the canakin clink ♪ ♪ A soldier's a man ♪ ♪ Man's life's but a span ♪ ♪ Why then let a soldier drink ♪ Some wine, boys. 'Fore God, an excellent song. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, your swag bellied Hollander drink, are nothing to your English. [laughs] Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? Why, he'll drink you with facility your Dane dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almaine. Then he'll give your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled. [cheers] To the health of our General. I am for it Lieutenant and I'll do you justice. Oh, sweet England. ♪ King Stephen was and a worthy peer ♪ ♪ His breeches cost him but a crown ♪ ♪ He held them sixpence all too dear ♪ ♪ With that he called the tailor lown ♪ ♪ He was a wight of high renown ♪ ♪ And thou art but of low degree ♪ ♪ 'Tis pride that pulls the country down ♪ ♪ Then take thine auld cloak about thee ♪ [all cheer] This is a more exquisite song than the other. Will you hear it again? No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place, that does those things Well, God's above all and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. It is true, good Lieutenant. For mine own part, no offence to the General, nor any man of quality. I hope to be saved. And so do I too, Lieutenant. Aye, but by your leave, not before me. The Lieutenant, is to be saved before the Ancient. [claps] Let's have no more of this, let's to our affairs. God forgive us our sins. Gentlemen, let's look to our business. [all laugh] Do not think gentlemen, that I am drunk. This is my Ancient, this is my right hand, this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough and I speak well enough. Excellent well. Very well gentlemen. [men chuckle] You must not think that I am drunk. [laughing] You see this fellow that's gone before, he is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar and give direction and do but see his vice. 'Tis to his virtue, a just equinox. The one as long as the other. 'Tis pity of him. I fear the trust Othello puts in him on some odd time of his infirmity, Will shake this island. But is he often thus? 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep. He'll watch the horologe a double set, If drink rock not his cradle. It were well the General who put in mind of it. Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio and looks not on his evils. Is not this true? How now, Roderigo. I pray you after the Lieutenant, go. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity. It were an honest action to say so to the Moor. Not I, for all this island. I do love Cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil. [man shouting] Hark, what this noise? [Montano] What's the matter, Lieutenant? A knave teach me my duty? I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. Beat me. [groans] Dost thou prate, rogue? Away I say, go out and cry a mutiny. Come, come, you're drunk. [mumbles] Lieutenant Sir! Montano Sir! Help masters, here's a goodly watch indeed. [Bell rings] Lieutenant sir. God's will, you will be shamed for ever! [man groans] Hold, for your lives! [bell gongs] From whence arise of this? Are we turned Turks and to ourselves? Do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl. He that stirs next to carve for his own rage, Holds his soul light, he dies upon his motion. Silence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle From her propriety. What is the matter masters? Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving, Speak, who began this on thy love I charge thee. I do not know. Friends all but now, even now. In quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed. And then but now, as if some planet had unwitted men. Swords out and tilting one at others' breasts In opposition bloody. I cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds. And would in action glorious I had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it. How comes it Michael, you are thus forgot? I pray you pardon me, I cannot speak. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be civil. The gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted. And your name is great in mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and, spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger. Your officer Iago, can inform you what, I spare breath something now offends me. Of all that I do know, nor know I aught by me that's said or done amiss this night, unless self charity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us. Now by heaven, my blood begins my safer guides to rule, and passion having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way. Zounds if I stir, or but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know how this foul rout began, who set it on and he that is approved in this offence though he had twinned with me both at a birth, shall lose me. What In a town of war yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, to manage private and domestic quarrel, at night? And on the court and guard of safety. 'Tis monstrous, Iago, who began't? If partially affined or leagued in office, thou dost deliver more or less than truth, Thou art no soldier. Touch me not so near. I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to Michael Cassio. Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him. This it is, General. Montano and myself being in speech, there comes a fellow crying out for help, and Cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him. Sir this gentleman steps in to Cassio to entreats his pause. Myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor. As it so fell out the town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot, outran my purpose and I returned the rather. For that I heard the clink and fall of swords and Cassio high in oath, which till tonight I ne'er might say before. When I came back for this was brief, I found them close together at blow and thrust, even as they were again, when you yourself did part them. More of this matter, can I not report. But men are men, the best sometimes forget. Though Cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best. Yet surely Cassio I believe, received from him that fled some strange indignity that patience could not pass. I know Iago, thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee, but nevermore be officer of mine. Look, if my gentle love be not raised up. I'll make thee an example. What is the matter, dear? All's well now sweeting, come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts myself will be your surgeon. Lead him off. Iago, look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. [footsteps tapping] What, are you hurt Lieutenant? Aye, past all surgery. Marry, God forbid. Reputation, reputation I've have lost my reputation. I have lost the immortal part and what remains is bestial. My reputation Iago, my reputation. As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound. There is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition. Oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What man! There are ways to recover the General again. You are but now cast in his mood. A punishment more in policy than in malices. One would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and he's yours. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken and so indiscreet an officer, Drunk. And speak parrot and squabble swagger swear. And discourse fustian with one's own shadow. Thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil. What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you. I know not. Is it possible? I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly. A quarrel but nothing wherefore. God, men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains, that we should with joy, pleasance, revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts. Why, you are but now well enough. How came you thus recovered? It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself. Come, you are too severe a moraller. As the time, the place and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. I will ask him for my place again. He shall tell me I am a drunkard. Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast. Strange. Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredience is a devil. Come come, good wine is a good familiar creature if well used, exclaim no more against it. And good Lieutenant, I think you think I love you. I have well approved it, sir. I drunk. You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I should tell you what you shall do. Our General's wife is now the General. I may say so in this respect, for thee hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her. Importune her help, to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. You advise me well. I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here. You are in the right Lieutenant. Good night, I must have the watch. Good night honest Iago. [footsteps tapping] And what's he then that says I play the villain. When this advice is free I give, and honest, Probal to thinking, and indeed the course to win the Moor again. For 'tis most easy the inclining Desdemona to subdue in any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the Moor, weren't to renounce his baptism. All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, his soul is so enfettered to her love, that she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. [chuckles] How am I then a villain to counsel Cassio to this parallel course directly to his good. [laughs] Divinity of hell. [chuckles] When devils will the blackest sins put on, they do suggest at first with heavenly shows, As I do now. [chuckles] For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes, and she for him pleads strongly with the Moor. [chuckles] I'll pour this pestilence into his ear, that she repeals him for her body's lust. [chuckles] And by how much she strives to do him good, she'll undo her credit with the Moor. So should I turn her virtue into pitch. [chuckles] And out of her own goodness, make the net that shall enmesh them all. [laughs] How now Roderigo? [laughs] I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains as that comes to and so with no money at all, and a little more wit, return again to Venice. How poor are they that have not patience. What wound did ever heal, but by degrees? Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time. Does't not go well, Cassio hath beaten thee. And thou by that small hurt hath cashiered Cassio. Though other things grow fair against the sun, yet, fruits that blossom first, shall first be ripe. [laughs] Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning. Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee, go where thou art billeted. Away I say, thou shalt know more hereafter. Nay, get thee gone. Two things are to be done. My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress. I'll set her on. Myself the while to draw the Moor apart. [chuckles] And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife. [laughs] Aye, that's the way. Dull not device with coldness and delay. [footsteps] Good morrow, good Lieutenant. I am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well. The General and his wife are talking of it, and she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves you, and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again. Yet I beseech you, give me advantage of some brief discourse with Desdemona alone. Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do all my abilities in thy behalf. Good madam, do I warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his. That's an honest fellow. Do not doubt Cassio, but I will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were. Bounteous madam, whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, he's never anything but your true servant. I know it, I thank you. You do love my lord, you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance. Aye, but lady, that policy may either last so long, or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstances that I being absent and my place supplied, my General will forget my love and service. Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here, I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee, if I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it to the last article. My lord shall never rest. I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience. His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift, I'll intermingle everything he does with Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry Cassio, for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away. Madam, here comes my lord. Madam, I'll take my leave. Nay, stay and hear me speak. Madam not now, I am very ill at ease, unfit for mine own purposes. Well, do your discretion. I like not that. What dost thou say? Nothing my lord, I know not what. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? Cassio my lord? Not sure, I cannot think it that he would sneak away so guilty like seeing you coming. I do believe 'twas he. How now, my lord? I have been talking with a suitor here, a man that languishes in your displeasure. Who is't you mean? Why your Lieutenant Cassio. Good my lord, if I have any grace or power to move you, his present reconciliation take. For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment of an honest face. I prithee call him back. Went he hence now? Yes faith, so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him. Good love, call him back. Not now, sweet Desdemon, some other time. But shall't be shortly? The sooner sweet, for you. Shall't be tonight, at supper? No, not tonight. Tomorrow dinner then? No,I shall not dine at home. I meet the captains at the citadel. Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn. On Tuesday noon or night, on Wednesday morn. I prithee name the time, but let it not exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent. And yet his trespass in our common reason save that, they say the wars must make example out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private check. When shall he come? Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny or stand so mammering on? What Michael Cassio, that came awooing with you? And so many a time when I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to do to bring him in. By'r Lady, I could do much. Prithee, no more. let him come when he will, I will deny thee nothing. Why, this is not a boon. 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves [laughs] or feed of nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person. Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed. It will be full of poise and difficult weight, and fearful to be granted. I will deny thee nothing. Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, to leave me but a little to my self. Shall I deny you? No, farewell my lord. Farewell Desdemona, I'll come to thee straight. Emilia come. Be as your fancies teach you, whate'er you be I am obedient. Excellent wretch. Erdition catch my soul, but I do love thee, and when I love thee not, chaos is come again. My noble lord. What dost thou say, Iago? Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, know of your love? He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask? But for a satisfaction of my thought, no further harm. Why of thy thought, Iago? I did not think he had been acquainted with her. Oh, yes and went between us very often. Indeed. Indeed, Aye, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that? Is he not honest? Honest, my lord? Honest, Aye, honest. My lord, for aught I know. What dost thou think? Think, my lord? Think, my lord. By heaven, he echoes me. As if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. I heard thee say even now, thou lik'st not that, when Cassio left my wife. What didst not like? And when I told thee, he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing, thou cried'st "Indeed." And didst contract and purse thy brow together, As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, Show me thy thought. My lord, you know I love you. I think thou dost and for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath, therefore these stops of thine affright me more. For such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just, they're close dilations, working from the heart, that passion cannot rule. For Michael Cassio, I dare presume, I think that he is honest. I think so too. Men should be what they seem. Or those that be not, would they might seem none. Certain men should be what they seem. Why then, I think Cassio's an honest man. Nay, yet there's more in this. I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words. Good my lord, pardon me. Though I am bound to every act of duty, I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts. Why, say they are vile and false? As where's that palace where into foul things sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure, but some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit With meditations lawful? Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think'st him wronged, and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts. I do beseech you, though I perchance am vicious in my guess. As I confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses, and of my jealousy shapes faults that are not. That your wisdom then, from one that so imperfectly conjects would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance. [chuckles] It were not for your quiet nor your good, nor for my manhood, honesty and wisdom to let you know my thoughts. What dost thou mean? Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse, steals trash 'tis something, nothing. 'Twas mine, 'tis his and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. Ha! Beware my lord, of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger, but O, what damned minutes tells he o'er, Who dotes yet doubts, suspects yet fondly loves. Oh, misery. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough. But riches fineless or is poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor. Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy. Why, why is this? Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy, to follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No, to be once in doubt is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat when I shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises, matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous, to say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well. Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt. For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago, I'll see before I doubt. when I doubt, prove. And on the proof, there is no more but this. Away at once with love or jealousy. I am glad of this. For now I shall have reason to show the love and duty I bear you with franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio. Wear your eye thus not jealous, nor secure. I would not have your free and noble nature, Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to it. I know our country disposition well. In Venice they do let God see the pranks they dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. Dost thou say so? She deceived her father marrying you. And when she seemed to shake, and fear your looks she loved them most. And so she did. Why go to then? She that so young could give out such a seeming, as to seel her father's eyes up close as oak. He thought 'twas witchcraft. But probably I am much to blame, I humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you. I am bound to thee for ever. I see this hath a little dashed your spirits. No, not a jot, you thought a jot. I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love. But I do see you're moved. I pray you, not to strain my speech to grosser issues, nor to further raise some to suspicion. I will not. Should you do so, my lord, my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aimed not at. Cassio's my worthy friend. My lord, I see you're moved. No, not much moved. I do not think but Desdemona's honest. Long live she so. And long live you to think so. And yet, how nature erring from itself. There's the point. Or it's to be bold with you, not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion and degree, Whereto we see in all things nature tends. One may smell in such a will most rank, foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural but pardon me, I do not in position distinctly speak of her, though I may fear her will recoiling to her better judgement, May fall to match you with her country forms. And happily repent. Farewell, farewell. If more thou dost perceive, let me know more. Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. My lord, I take my leave. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless sees and knows more, much more than he unfolds. My lord, I would I might entreat you to scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time. Although 'tis fit that Cassio have his place, for sure he fills it up with great ability, Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, You might by that perceive him and his means. Note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement suit, much will be said in that. In the meantime, let me be thought too busy in my fears. As worthy cause I have to fear I am, and hold her free, I do beseech your honor. Fear not my government. I once more take my leave. This fellow's of exceeding honesty, and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, though that her jesses were my dear heart strings, I'd whistle her off, and let her down the wind to prey at fortune. [chuckles] Haply, for I am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have. Or for, I am declined into the vale of years. That's not much. She's gone. I am abused and my relief must be to loathe her. Oh, curse of marriage, that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites. I had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon, than keep a corner in the thing I love for others' uses. Yet 'tis the plague of great ones. Prerogatived are they less than the base. 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death. Even then this forked plague is fated to us, when we do quicken, she comes. If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself, I'll not believe it. How now, my dear Othello? Your dinner and the generous islanders is by you invited, do attend your presence. I am to blame. Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well? I have a pain upon my forehead here. Faith, that's with watching, 'twill away again. Let me but bind it hard, within this hour It will be well. Come on your napkin is too small. Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you. I am very sorry that you are not well. I am glad I have found this napkin. This was her first remembrance from the Moor. My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wooed me to steal it but she so loves the token. For he conjured her, she should ever keep it, that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out and give't Iago. What he will do with it, heaven knows, not I. I nothing, but to please his fantasy. How now, what do you here alone? Do not you chide. I have a thing for you. You have a thing for me? It is a common thing. Ha? To have a foolish wife. Oh, is that all? What will you give me now for that same handkerchief? What handkerchief? Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona. That which so often you did bid me steal. Hast stol'n it from her? No, faith, she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage, I being here, took't up. Look, here it is. A good wench, give it me. What will you do with it, that you have been so earnest to have me filch it? Why, what is that to you? [chuckles] [laughs] If it be not for some purpose of import, give me it again. Poor lady, she'll run mad when she shall lack it. Be not acknown on it, I have use for it. Go, leave me. [laughs] In Cassio's lodging, I'll lose this napkin, and let him find it. Trifles light as air are to those jealous, confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ. This may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison. Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons, which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood, burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so. Look where he comes. [chuckles] Not poppy nor mandragora, nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owed'st yesterday. [chuckles] False, to me. Why, how now my lord, no more of that. Avaunt! Be gone. Thou hast set me on the rack. I swear 'tis better to be much abused, than but to know't a little. How now, my lord? What sense had I, of her stolen hours of lust? I saw it not, thought it not, it harmed not me. I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry. I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips. He that is robbed, not wanting what is stolen, let him not know it, and he's not robbed at all. I am sorry to hear this. I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known. Oh, now forever. Farewell the tranquil mind, Farewell content. Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars that make ambition virtue, farewell. Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, the spirit-stirring drum, the ear piercing fife, the royal banner and all quality, Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war. And Oh you mortal engines, whose rude throats the immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit. Farewell, Othello's occupation's gone. Is't possible, my lord? Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, be sure of it. Or by the worth of mine eternal soul, thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath. Is't come to this? Make me to see't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life. My noble lord. If thou dost slander her and torture me, never pray more, abandon all remorse on horror's head, horrors accumulate. Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed. For nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that. Oh grace, heaven forgive me. Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense? God bu'y you take mine office. Oh, wretched fool that lov'st to make thine honesty a vice. Oh, monstrous world! Take note, take note Oh world. To be direct and honest is not safe. I thank you for this profit, and from hence I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence. Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest. I should be wise, for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for. By the world I think my wife be honest, and think she is not. I think that thou art just and think thou art not. I'll have some proof. Her name that was as fresh as Dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face. If there be cords or knives, poison or fire or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied. I see you are eaten up with passion. [laughs] I regret me that I ever put it to you. You would be satisfied? Nay, and I will. And may but how, how satisfied? Would you the supervisor, grossly gape on? Behold her topped? Death and damnation! It were a tedious difficulty, I think, to bring them to that prospect. Damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own. What then? How then? What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride [yells] and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk. But yet I say, if imputation and strong circumstance, which lead directly to the door of truth, will give you satisfaction, you might have it. You give me a living reason she's disloyal. I do not like the office. But sith I am entered in this cause so far Pricked to it by foolish honesty and love, I will go on. [sighs] I lay with Cassio lately, and being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep. There are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary, let us hide our loves." And then sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cried "Oh sweet creature." and kiss me hard. As if he plucked up kisses by the roots, that grew upon my lips, then laid his leg over my thigh, and sighed and kissed, and cried "Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor." Oh monstrous, Monstrous. Nay, this was just but his dream. Nay, but this denoted a foregone conclusion. 'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. And this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate so thinly. I'll tear her all to pieces! Nay, but be wise! We see nothing done, she may be honest yet. Tell me but this, have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief, spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? I gave her such a one, 'twas my first gift. I know not that. Such a handkerchief, I am sure it was your wife's. Did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with. If it be that... If it be that or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs. Oh that the slave had forty thousand lives. One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now, Look here Iago, all my fond love, thus do I blow to heaven, 'Tis gone. Arise black vengeance, from thy hollow hell! Yield up, Oh love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate. Swell bosom with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues! Yet be content. Blood, blood, blood! Patience your mind, perhaps may change. Never Iago, Like to the Pontic sea. Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on to the Propontic and the Hellespont, even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up. [sobs] Now, by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words. Do not rise yet. Witness you ever burning lights above. You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago, doth give up the execution of his wit, hands, heart, to wronged Othello's service. Let him command, and to obey shall be in me remorse. What bloody business ever. I greet thy love, not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous. And will upon the instant put thee to it. Within these three days, let me hear thee say, that Cassio's not alive. My friend is dead. 'Tis done at your request, but let her live. Damn her, lewd minx, damn her, damn her. Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw to furnish me with some quick means of death, for the fair devil. Now, art thou, my Lieutenant. I am your own forever. Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia? I know not, madam. Believe me, I had rather loose my purse full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor is true of mind, and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are, it were enough to put him to ill thinking. Is he not jealous? Who he? I think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him. Look where he comes. I will not leave him now till Cassio be called to him. How is't with you, my lord? Well, my good lady. Oh hardness to dissemble. How do you, Desdemona? Well, my good lord. Give me thy hand. This hand is moist, my lady. It yet hath felt no age, nor known no sorrow. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart. Hot, hot and moist. This hand of yours requiresa sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, much castigation, exercise devout. For there's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, a frank one. You may indeed say so. For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. [laughing] A liberal hand. The hearts of old, gave hands. But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise. What promise chuck? I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me. Lend me thy handkerchief. Here, my lord. That which I gave you. I have it not about me. Not? No my lord. That's a fault. That handkerchief, did an Egyptian to my mother give. She was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it, 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love. But if she lost it, or made a gift of it, my father's eye Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt after new fancies. She dying, gave it me, And bid me, when my fate would have me wife, I give it her. I did so and take heed on't. Make it a darling, like your precious eye. To lose or give't away, were such perdition as nothing else could match. Is't possible? It is true. There's magic in the web of it. A sibyl, that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses, in her prophetic fury sewed the work. The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, and it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful conserved of maidens' hearts. Indeed Is't true? Most veritable, therefore look to it well. Then would to God that I had never seen it. Ha, Wherefore? Why do you speak so startlingly and rash? Is't lost, Is't gone? Speak, is't out o'th' way? Heaven bless us. Say you? It is not lost. But what an if it were? How? I say it is not lost. Fetch it, let me see it. Why so, I can sir. But I will not now. [chuckles] This is a trick to put me from my suit. [laughs] I Pray you, let Cassio be received again. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives. Come, come, you'll never meet a more sufficient man. The handkerchief. I pray you talk me of Cassio. The handkerchief. A man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love, shared dangers with you. The handkerchief! I'faith you are to blame. Zounds! Is not this man jealous? I ne'er saw this before. Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief. I am most unhappy in the loss of it. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man. They are all but stomachs and we all but food. They eat us hungerly and when they are full, They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband. There is no other way, 'tis she must do it. And loe the happiness. Go and importune her. How now good Cassio? What's the news with you? Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you that by your virtuous means I may again exist and be a member of his love, whom I with all the office of my heart entirely honour. I would not be delayed. If my offense be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrow, nor purposed merit in futurity, can ransom me into his love again, but to know so, must be my benefit. So shall I clothe me in a forced content, and shut myself up in some other course to Fortune's alms. Alas, thrice gentle Cassio. My advocation is not now in tune. My lord is not my lord, nor would I know him, Were he in favor as in humor altered. So help me every spirit sanctified I've spoken for you all my best. And stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech. You must a while be patient. What I can do, I will. And more I will, than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you. Is my lord angry? He went hence but now, and certainly in strange unquietness. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air. And like the devil from his very arm Puffed his own brother, is he angry? Something of moment then, I will go meet him. There's matter in it indeed if he be angry. I prithee do so. Something sure of state, either from Venice, or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit. And in such cases men's natures wrangle with inferior things, though great ones are their object, 'Tis even so. For let our finger ache, and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods, nor of them look for such observancy as fit the bridal. Beshrew me much Emilia, I was unhandsome warrior as I am arraigning his unkindness with my soul, but now I find I had suborned the witness and he's indicted falsely. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think, and no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you. Alas the day, I never gave him cause. But jealous souls will not be answered so, they are not ever jealous for the cause, but jealous for they're jealous. It is a monster begot upon itself, born on itself. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind. Lady, amen. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk here about. If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit, and seek to effect it to my uttermost. I humbly thank your ladyship. 'Save you, friend Cassio. What make you from home? How is it with you my most fair Bianca? I'faith sweet love, I was coming to your house. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. What Keep a week away? Seven days and nights? Eight score eight hours? And lovers' hours more tedious than the dial eight score times. Oh weary reckoning. Pardon me Bianca. I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed, but I shall in a more continuate time Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca, take me this work out. Cassio, whence came this? This is some token from a newer friend. To the felt absence now I feel a cause. Is't come to this? Well, well. Go too, woman. Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth from whence you have them. You are jealous now that this is from some mistress, some remembrance? No, by my faith Bianca. Why, whose is it? I know not neither, I found it in my chamber. I like the work well. Ere it be demanded as like enough it will, I would have it copied. So take it and do it and leave me for this time. Leave you Wherefore? I do attend here on the General, and think it no addition nor my wish, to have him see me womaned. Why, I pray you? Not that I love you not. But that you do not love me. I pray you, bring me on the way a little and say if I shall see you soon at night. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here, but I'll see you soon. It is very good. I must be circumstanced. [footsteps] Well, you think so? Think so, Iago? What, to kiss in private? An unauthorized kiss. Or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more, not meaning any harm? Naked in bed Iago, and not mean harm? It is hypocrisy against the devil. They that mean virtuously and yet do so, the devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip. But if I give my wife a handkerchief, What then? Why, then 'tis hers my lord, and being hers, She may, I think, bestow it on any man. She is protectress of her honor too. May she give that? Her honor is an essence that's not seen. They have it very oft that have it not. But for the handkerchief? By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. Thou said'st, it comes over my memory as doth the raven infected house, Boding to all. He had my handkerchief. Aye, what of that? That's not so good now. What if I had said, I had seen him do you wrong. Or heard him say as knaves be such abroad, who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinced or supplied them. But they cannot choose but they must blab. Hath he said anything? He hath, my lord. But be you well assured no more than he'll unswear. What hath he said? Faith, that he did. I know not what he did. What? Lie With her? With her, on her, what you will. Lie with her, Lie on her? We say lie on her when they belie her. Lie with her, Zounds, that's fulsome. Handkerchief confession, handkerchief! To confess and be hanged for his labor. First to be hanged and then to confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. [groans] Is't possible? [groans] Confess. Handkerchief! [groans] [laughs] Work on, my medicine work. Thus credulous fools are caught. And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach. What ho, my lord! [groans] My lord, I say, Othello. How now, Cassio. What's the matter? My lord has fallen into an epilepsy. This is his second fit, he had one yesterday. Rub him about the temples. No, forbear. The lethargy must have his quiet course. If not, he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs. Do you withdraw yourself a little while. He will recover straight. When he is gone, I would on great occasion speak with you. How is it, General? Have you not hurt your head? Dost thou mock me? I mock you? No by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man. A horned man's a monster and a beast. There's many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster. Did he confess it? Good sir, be a man. Think every bearded fellow, that's but yoked May draw with you. There's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds, which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better. It is the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch. No, let me know, and knowing what I am, I know what she shall be. Nay, thou art wise, 'tis certain. Stand you awhile apart. Confine yourself but in a patient list. While you were here, overwhelmed with your grief, a passion most unsuiting such a man, Cassio came hither. I shifted him away and laid good excuse upon your ecstasy. Bade him anon return and here speak with me, Do but encave yourself. And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face. For I will make him tell the tale a new, Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when. He hath and is again, to cope your wife. Hurry I say, but mark his gestures. Marry patience! Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen and nothing of a man. Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience, but dost thou hear? most bloody. That's not amiss, yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? [footsteps] Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, a housewife, that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature that dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one. He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain from her excess of laughter. Here he comes. As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad. And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior quite in the wrong. How do you now, Lieutenant? The worser that you give me the addition, whose want even kills me. Ply Desdemona well and you are sure on't. Now if this suit lay in Bianca's power, how quickly should you speed. Alas, poor caitiff. I never knew woman love man so. Alas, poor rogue! I think i'faith she loves me. Do you hear, Cassio? She gives it out, that you shall marry her. Do you intend it? [laughs] I marry her. What, a customer? Prithee bear some charity to my wit. Do not think it so unwholesome. The cry goes that you shall marry her. Prithee, say true. I am a very villain else. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise. She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so hales and pulls me. [chuckles] Well, I must leave her company. Before me, look where she comes. 'Tis such another fitchew Marry, a perfumed one. What do you mean by this haunting of me? Let the devil and his dam haunt you. What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the whole work. A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there. This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby horse, wheresoever you had it. I'll take out no work on it. [yells] And you'll come to supper tonight, you may. And you may not, come when you are next prepared for. After her, after her. Faith I must, she'll rail in the street else. will you sup there? Faith, I intend to. Well, I may chance to see you. For I would very fain speak with you. Prithee come, will you? Go too, Say no more. [sobs] How shall I murder him, Iago? Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? Oh, Iago. Did you see the handkerchief? Was that mine? Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman, your wife. She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. I would have him nine years a killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman. Nay, you must forget that. let her rot and perish and be damned tonight, for she shall not live, no. My heart is turned to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. The world, hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks. Nay, that's not your way. Hang her. I do but say what she is so delicate with her needle, an admirable musician. Oh, she will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention. She's the worse for all this. Aye, a thousand, thousand times. And then of so gentle a condition. Aye, too gentle. Nay, that's certain, but yet the pity of it, Iago. Oh Iago, the pity of it, Iago. If you be so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend. For if it touch not you, it comes near nobody. [sobs] I'll chop her into messes, Cuckold me! 'Tis foul in her. With mine officer! That's fouler. Get me some poison this night Iago. I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again, this night, Iago. Do it not with poison. strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. [chuckles] Good, the justice of it pleases. very good. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight. Excellent good. Now what trumpet is that same? I warrant, something from Venice. [fast footsteps] 'Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke, see, your wife is with him. God save you, worthy General. With all my heart, sir. The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. What's the news, good cousin Lodovico? I am very glad to see you signor. Welcome to Cyprus. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? Lives, sir. Cousin, there's fallen between him and my lord the most unkind breach, but you shall make all well. Are you sure of that? My lord? This fail you not to do as you will. He did not call you, he's busy in the paper. Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? A most unhappy one. I would do much to atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. Fire and brimstone. My lord? Are you wise? What, is he angry? Maybe the letter moved him. For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government. By my troth, I am glad on it. Indeed! My lord? I am glad to see you mad. Why, sweet Othello. Devil! [sobs] My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much. Make her amends, she weeps. Oh devil, devil! If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, each drop she falls, would prove a crocodile. Out of my sight! I will not stay to offend you. Truly an obedient lady. I do beseech your lordship, call her back. Mistress. My lord? What would you with her, sir? Who? I, my lord? Aye, you did wish that should make her turn. Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on and turn again. And she can weep sir, weep. And she's obedient as you say, obedient. Very obedient, proceed you in your tears. [sobs] Concerning this, sir, Oh well, painted passion. I am commanded home get you away. I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, and will return to Venice. Hence avaunt. Cassio shall have my place. sir, tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together. You are welcome sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys. Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature whom passion could not shake? Whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce? He is much changed. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain? That he is. I may not breathe my censure what he might be. If what he might be he is not be what the heaven he were. What, Strike his wife! Faith, that was not so well. For would I knew that stroke would prove the worst. Is it his use? Or did the letters work upon his blood and new create this fault? Alas, alas! It is not honesty in me to speak what I have seen and known. But you shall observe him, and his own courses will denote him so, that I may save my speech. Will you go after, and mark how he continues. I am sorry that I am deceived in him. [footsteps] You have seen nothing then? Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together. But then I saw no harm. And then I heard each syllable that breath made up between them. What, Did they never whisper? Never, my lord. Nor send you out of the way? Never. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask nor nothing? Never, my lord. That's strange. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other remove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom. If any wretch have put this in your head, let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse. For if she be not honest, chaste and true, there's no man happy. The purest of their wives is foul as slander. Bid her come hither, go, go. She says enough, yet she's a simple bawd, that cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, a closet lock and key of villainous secrets. And yet she'll kneel and pray, I have seen her do't. My lord, what is your will? I pray you chuck, come hither. What is your pleasure? Let me see your eyes. Look in my face. What horrible fancy's this? Some of your function, mistress. Leave procreants alone and shut the door. Cough or cry 'hem' if anybody come. Your mystery, your mystery. Nay, dispatch. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? I understand a fury in your words, but not the words. Why, what art thou? Your wife my lord, your true and loyal wife. Come swear it, damn thyself. Lest being like one of heaven, the devils themselves should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damned. Swear thou art honest. Heaven doth truly know it. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. To whom my lord? With whom? How am I false? [sobs] Desdemon, away, away, away. How's thy day? Why do you weep? Am I the motive of these tears my lord? If haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back, lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him, why I have lost him too. Had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction, had they rained all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head, steeped me in poverty to the very lips, given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience. But alas, to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn, to point his slow unmoving finger at, yet could I bear that too, well, very well. [sobs] But there where I have garnered up my heart where either I must live or bear no life, the fountain from the which my current runs, or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in. [mourns] Turn thy complexion there, patience, thou young and rose -lipped cherubin, Aye, there look grim as hell. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. Aye, As summer flies are in the shambles, that quicken even with blowing, Oh, thou weed, Who art so lovely fair, and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst never been born. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, made to write whore upon What committed. Committed, how thou public commoner, I should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty, did I but speak thy deeds. What committed? Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks. The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets, Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear it. What committed? Impudent strumpet. By heaven, you do me wrong. Are you not a strumpet? No, as I am a Christian. If to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch, be not to be a strumpet, well I am none. What, Not a whore? No, as I shall be saved. Is't possible? Oh, heaven forgive us. I cry you mercy then. I took you for that cunning whore of Venice that married with Othello. [sobs] You, mistress, that have the office opposite to Saint Peter and keep the gate of hell. You, you, aye you! We have done our course, there's money for your pains. I pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady? Faith, half asleep. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? With who? Why with my lord, sweet lady. Who is thy lord? He that is yours, sweet lady. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia. I cannot weep, nor answer have I none, but what should go by water. I Prithee tonight lay on my bed, my wedding sheets, remember, and call thy husband hither. Here's a change indeed. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet. How have I been behaved, that he might stick the smallest opinion on my greatest abuse? [footsteps] What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you? I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks. He might have chid me so, for, in good faith. I am a child to chiding. What is the matter, lady? Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true heart cannot bear it. Am I that name, Iago? What name, fair lady? Such as she said my lord did say I was. He called her whore, a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callet. Why did he so? I do not know, [weeps] I am sure I am none such. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day. Hath she forsook so many noble matches, her father and her country, all her friends to be called whore? Would it not make one weep? It is my wretched fortune. Beshrew him for't. How comes this trick upon him? Nay, heaven doth know. I will be hanged if some eternal villain, some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, have not devised this slander, I'll be hanged else. There is no such man. It is impossible. If any such there be, heaven pardon him. A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones. Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company? What place, what time, what form, what likelihood? The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave, some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. Oh heaven, that such companions thou'dst unfold, and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world, even from the east to the west. Speak within doors. Oh, fie upon them! Some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the Moor. You are a fool, go to. Oh, good Iago, how should win my lord again? Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him. Here I do kneel. If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, either in discourse of thought or actual deed, or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense delighted them in any other form or that I do not yet, and ever did, and ever will, though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement, love him dearly, comfort forswear me. Unkindness may do much. And his unkindness may defeat my life, but never taint my love. I cannot say "whore" It does abhor me now I speak the word, to do the act that might the addition earn, not the world's mass of vanity could make me. I pray you, be content. 'Tis but his humor. The business of the state does him offense, and he does chide with you. If 'twere no other. It is not so, I warrant. Hark how these instruments, summon you to supper. [laughs] The messengers of Venice stay the meat. Go in, and weep not. All things shall be well. [laughs] How now, Roderigo? I do not find that thou deal'st justly with me. What in the contrary? Every day thou daff'st me with some device, Iago, and rather as it seems to me now, keep'st from me all conveniency, than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered. Will you hear me, Roderigo? Faith, I have heard too much. For your words and performances are no kin together. You charge me most unjustly. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none. Well, go to, very well. Very well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor 'tis not very well. Nay, by this hand I say it is very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it. Very well. I tell you, 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawfulsolicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you. You have said now. Aye, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee. And even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception. But yet I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. It hath not appeared. I grant, indeed, it hath not appeared. And your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to suspect now than ever. Why, I mean purpose, courage, and valor. This night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery, and devise engines for my life. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass? Sir, there is a special commission coming from Venice, to depute Cassio in Othello's place. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice. No, he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident. But in, none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio. How do you mean "removing" of him? Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place. knocking out his brains. And that you would have me do? Aye, and if you dare do yourself a profit and a right, he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure. I will be nearby to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death, that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper time and the night grows to waste about it. I will hear further reason for this. And you shall be satisfied. [footsteps] I do beseech you sir, trouble yourself no further. Pardon me, 'twill do me good to walk. Madam, good night. I humbly thank your ladyship. Your honor is most welcome. Sir will you walk? Desdemona. My lord. Get you to bed on th' instant. I will be returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there, look it be done. I will, my lord. [footsteps] How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did. He says he will return incontinent. He hath commanded me to go to bed, and bade me to dismiss you. Dismiss me? It was his bidding, therefore, good Emilia. Give me my nightly wearing. We must not now displease him. I would you had never seen him. So would not I, my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns Prithee unpin me, have grace and favor in them. I have laid those sheets, you bade me on the bed. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds. If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets. Come, come you talk. [hums] My mother had a maid called Barbary. She was in love, and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her. She had a song of willow. An old thing 'twas but it expressed her fortune, and she died singing it. that song tonight not go from my mind. I have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side, and sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch. Shall I go fetch your nightgown? No, unpin me here. This Lodovico is a proper man. A very handsome man. He speaks well. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

Oh, mine eyes do itch. Doth that bode weeping? 'Tis neither here nor there. I have heard it said so. Oh, these men, these men. Dost thou in conscience think, tell me Emilia. That there be women, do abuse their husbands In such gross kind. There be some such, no question. Wouldst thou do such a deed, for all the world? Why, would not you? Nay, by this heavenly light. Nor I neither, by this heavenly light. I might do it as well in the dark. [chuckles] Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? The world's a huge thing, it's a great price for a small vice. In troth, I think thou wouldst not. By my troth I think I should, and undo 't when I had done it. Not to Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for all the whole world, Ud's pity, who would not make her husband a cuckold, to make him a monarch. I should venture purgatory for't. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world. Why the wrong is but a wrong in the world, and having the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right. I do not believe there is any such woman. Yes, a dozen. And as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for. But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps. Or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite. Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know their wives have sense like them. They see and smell, and have their palates both for sweet and sour as men have. [sighs] What is it that they do, when they change us for others? Is it sport? I think it is. And doth affection breed it? I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs? It is so too. And have not we affections, desires for sport and frailty, as men have? Then let them use us well. Else let them know the ills we do, their ills instruct us so. Well, good night, good night. God me such uses send, not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend. [hums] [footsteps] Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he come. Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home. Quick quick, fear nothing. I'll be at thy elbow. It makes us, or it mars us, think on that. And fix most firm thy resolution. Be near at hand, I may miscarry in't. Here at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand. I have no great devotion to the deed, yet he hath given me satisfying reasons. 'Tis but a man gone. Forth my sword he dies. [laughs] I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense, and he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, or Cassio him or each do kill the other, every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo, he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels, that I bobbed from him as gifts to Desdemona. It must not be. If Cassio do remain, he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor may unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril. No, he must die. Be it so, [chuckles] I hear him coming. I know his gait, 'tis he. Villain, thou diest! That thrust had been mine enemy indeed, But that my coat is better than thou think'st. I will make proof of thine. [grunts] [footsteps] [gasps] [groans] I am slain! [groans] I am maimed for ever. Iago keeps his word. 'Tis he! Brave Iago, honest and just. [groans] Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come. Forth of mine heart, those charms, thine eyes are blotted. Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust's blood be spotted. [groans] 'Tis some mischance, of which is very direful. Two or three groan. It is a heavy night. These may be counterfeits. Let's think't unsafe to come in to the cry without more help. [groans] Hark! Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murder? We do not know. Did you not hear a cry? Here for heaven's sake, help me. What's the matter? The same indeed, a very valiant fellow. What are you here, that cry so grievously? Iago, I am spoiled, undone by villains. Give me some help. Oh, me Lieutenant. What villains have done this? I think that one of them is here about and cannot make away. Treacherous villains! What are you there? Come in and give some help. Oh, help me here. That's one of them. Oh, murd'rous slave! Oh, villain! [gasps] Damned Iago, inhuman dog. Kill men in the dark? Where be these bloody thieves? How silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder! What may you be? Are you of good or evil? As you shall prove us, praise us. Signor Lodovico? He, sir. I cry your pardon. Here's Cassio hurt by villains. How is't, brother? My leg is cut in two. Marry, heaven forbid. I'll bind it with my shirt. What is the matter? Who is't that cried? Oh, my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio. Oh, Cassio. A notable strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect who they should be who thus have mangled you? No. I am sorry to find you thus I have been to seek you. Nor for a chair to bear him easily hence. Alas, he faints. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash to be a party in this injury. Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come, lend me a torch. Know we this face or no? Alas, my friend, my dear countryman, Roderigo. No. yes, sure. Oh heaven, Roderigo! What, Of Venice? Even he, sir. Did you know him? Know him Aye. Signor Gratiano, I cry you gentle pardon for these bloody accidents must excuse my manners that so neglected you. I am glad to see you. How do you, Cassio? A chair, a chair! Roderigo. [mourns] [footsteps tap] A chair. I'll fetch the General's surgeon. For you mistress, save you your labours. What of lies slain here, Cassio, was my dear friend. What malice was between you? None in the world, nor do I know the man. What, look you pale? bear him out of the air. Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress? Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon. Behold her well, I prithee you look upon her. Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak though tongues were out of use. 'Las, what's the matter? [footsteps] What's the matter, husband? Cassio hath here been set on in the dark by Roderigo and fellows that are scaped: He's almost slain and Roderigo quite dead. Alas, good gentleman. Alas, good Cassio. This is the fruit of whoring, Prithee Emilia. Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight. What, do you shake at that? He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not. Oh, did he so? I charge you go with me. Fie, fie upon thee strumpet! I am no strumpet, but of life as honest as you that thus abuse me. As I Foh? Fie upon thee strumpet! Kind gentlemen, let's see poor Cassio dressed. Come mistress, you must tell's another tale. Emilia, run you to the citadel and tell my lord and lady what hath happed. Will you go on a fore? [chuckles] This is the night that either makes me, or fordoes me quite. [laughs] [footsteps tapping] It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul. Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars. It is the cause. [footsteps tapping] Yet, I'll not shed her blood, nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, and smooth as monumental alabaster. Yet she must die. Else she'll betray more men. Put out the light. And then, put out the light. If I quench thee thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, should I repent me. But once put out thy light, thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat that can thy light relume. When I have plucked thy rose, I cannot give it vital growth again. It must needs wither. I'll smell it on the tree. Oh balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword. One more, one more. Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee, and love thee after. One more, and this the last. [sobs] So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep. But they are cruel tears, this sorrow's heavenly. It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. Who's there? Othello? Aye, Desdemona. Will you come to bed, my lord? Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona? Aye, my lord. If you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, solicit for it straight. Like what may you mean by that? Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by. I would not kill thy unprepared spirit. No, heaven forfend. I would not kill thy soul. Talk you of killing? [sobs] Aye, I do. Then heaven have mercy on me. Amen, with all my heart. If you say so. I hope you will not kill me. [sobs] And yet I fear you. For you're fatal then when your eyes roll so. I know not why I fear, since guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear. Think on thy sins. They are loves I bear to thee. Aye, and for that thou diest. That death's unnatural that kills for loving. why gnaw you so your nether lip? Some bloody passion shakes your very frame. These are portents but yet I hope, I hope they do not point on me. Peace and be still! I will so. What's the matter? That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee, thou gav'st to Cassio. No by my life and soul. Send for the man and ask him. Sweet soul take heed, take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed. Aye, but not yet to die. Yes, presently, therefore confess thee freely of thy sin. For to deny each article with oath, cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that I do groan withal thou art to die. Then Lord have mercy on me. I say, amen. And have you mercy too! I never did offend you in my life, never loved Cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as I might love, I never gave him token. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand, Oh perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart, and mak'st me call what I intend to do a murder, which I thought a sacrifice. I saw the handkerchief. He found it then, I never gave it him. Send for him hither. Let him confess a truth. He hath confessed. What, my lord? That he hath used thee. [shouts] How, Unlawfully? Aye. He will not say so. No, his mouth is stopped. Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. My fear interprets what, is he dead? Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge had stomach for them all. Alas, he is betrayed and I undone. [mourns] Out strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face? Banish me my lord, but kill me not. Down strumpet! Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight. -Nay, if you strive. -But half an hour. -It is too late. -Oh Lord, Lord, Lord! [sobs loud] [Pants] [door knocks] [Emilia] My lord, my lord. [door knocks] What hoe My lord, my lord! [door knocks] What noise is this? [door knocks] Not dead, not yet quite dead. I that am cruel, am yet merciful. I would not have thee linger in thy pain. [gasps] So, so. [pants] Who's there? Yet, 'tis Emilia. [Emilia] Oh, good my lord, I would speak a word with you. By and by. [door knocks gently] she's dead. [pants] 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death. The noise was high. [sobs] [door knocks] No more moving, still as the grave. Should she come in, Were't good? I think she stirs again. No, What's the best? If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife. My wife, my wife, what wife? I have no wife. [sobs] Insupportable! Oh heavy hour! [sobs] Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon, and that th' affrighted globe should yawn at alteration. [Emilia] Oh, good my lord! [door knocks] I had forgot thee. Oh come in, Emilia. Soft by and by, let me the curtains draw. Where art thou? [footsteps] What's the matter with thee now? Oh, my good lord, yonder's foul murder done. What now? But now, my lord. It is the very error of the moon. She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, and makes men mad. Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian called Roderigo. Roderigo killed and Cassio killed? No, Cassio is not killed. Not Cassio killed! Then murder's out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh. [faint groaning] O Lord, What cry is that? That What? Out and alas, that was my mistress voice. [gasps] Help, help ho. Oh lady, speak again. Sweet Desdemona, Oh, sweet mistress speak. [gasps] A guiltless death I die. [mourns] Oh, who hath done this deed? Nobody, I myself. Oh, farewell. Commend me to my kind lord. [faint groan] Oh farewell. [mourns] Why, how should she be murdered? Alas, who knows? You heard her say herself it was not I. She said so, I must needs report the truth. She's like a liar gone to burning hell. 'Twas I that killed her. Oh, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil! She turned to folly and she was a whore. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. She was false as water. Thou art rash as fire to say that she was false. Oh, she was heavenly true! Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else. Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, but that I did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity. Thy husband knew it all. My husband. Thy husband. That she was false to wedlock? Aye, with Cassio. Nay had she been true, [laughs] If heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I'd not have sold her for it. My husband! Thy husband. Aye, 'twas he that told me on her first. An honest man he is, and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds. My husband. What needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband. Oh mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love. My husband say that she was false? He, woman. I say thy husband dost understand the word? My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. [chuckles] If he say so, may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day. He lies to the heart. She was too fond of her most filthy bargain. [groans] Do thy worst. This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her. Peace, you were best. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm as I have to be hurt. Oh gull! Oh, dolt! As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed I care not for thy sword. I'll make thee known, though I lost twenty lives. Help, Help ho! The Moor hath killed my mistress. Murder, Murder! What is the matter? How now, General! Oh, are you come Iago. You have done well, that men must lay their murders on your neck. What is the matter? Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man. He says thou told'st him that his wife was false. I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain. Speak, for my heart is full. I told him what I thought, and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true. But did you ever tell him she was false? I did. You told a lie, an odious damned lie upon my soul, a wicked lie. She false with Cassio. Did you say with Cassio? With Cassio, mistress. Go too, charm your tongue. I will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak. My mistress here lies murdered in her bed. Oh heavens forfend! [footsteps] And your reports have set the murder on. Villainy, villainy, villainy. I think upon it, I think, I smell't villainy! I thought so then, I'll kill myself for grief. Villainy, villainy. What, are you mad? I charge you get you home. I pray you, let me have leave to speak. 'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. [sobs] Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent that e'er did lift up eye. Oh, she was foul! [screams] I scarce did know you uncle, there lies your niece, whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopped. I know this act shows horrible and grim. Poor Desdemona, I am glad thy father's dead. Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now, this sight would make him do a desperate turn, Yea, curse his better angel from his side, and fall to reprobance. 'Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows that she with Cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it. And she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand. It was a handkerchief, an antique token. My father, gave my mother. Oh, God. Oh, heavenly God. Zounds, hold your peace. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace? No, I will speak as liberal as the north. Let heaven, and men, and devils, let them all. All, all cry shame against me, yet I'll speak. Be wise and get you home. I will not. Fye, Your sword upon a woman! Oh thou dull Moor. That handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband, For often, with a solemn earnestness. More than indeed belonged to such a trifle He begged of me to steal it. Villainous whore! She give it Cassio? No, I found it and I did give't my husband. Filth, thou liest! By heaven I do not, I do not gentlemen. Oh, murderous coxcomb, what should such a fool do with so good a wife? Are there no stones in heaven. But what serve for the thunder? Hold on, recious villain! [shouts] The woman falls, sure he hath killed his wife. [mourns] Lay me by my mistress' side. He's gone, but his wife's killed. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon, which I have here recovered from the Moor. Come guard the door without let him not pass, but kill him rather. I'll after that same villain, for 'tis a damned slave. [sobs] I am not valiant neither, but ever puny whipster gets my sword. But why should honor, outlive honesty? Let it go all. What did thy song bode lady? Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan, and die in music. ♪ Willow willow willow ♪ Moor, she was chaste. she loved thee, cruel Moor. So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true. So speaking as I think, alas, I die. [sighs] I have another weapon in this chamber. It was a sword of Spain, the ice brook's temper. Oh, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. [Gratiano] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear. Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer. Look in upon me then, and speak with me, or naked as I am I will assault thee. What is the matter? Behold, I have a weapon. A better never did itself sustain upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword, I have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop. But, Oh, vain boast. Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now. Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed. Here is my journey's end, here is my butt, and very sea mark of my utmost sail. Do you go back dismayed? 'Tis a lost fear. Man but a rush, against Othello's breast, and he retires. Where should Othello go? Now, how dost thou look now? Oh, ill starred wench. Pale as thy smock. When we shall meet at compt, this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl, even like thy chastity. Oh cursed, cursed slave. [weeps] Whip me, ye devils. From the possession of this heavenly sight! Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulfur! Wash me in steep own gulfs of liquid fire! Oh Desdemona, Dead. [sobs] Oh Desdemona, Dead. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? That's he that was Othello, here I am. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth. I look down towards his feet, but that's a fable. If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee. Wrench his sword from him. I bleed sir, but not killed. I am not sorry neither, I'd have thee live, for in my sense, 'tis happiness to die. Oh, thou Othello, that wast once so good, fallen in the practice of a damned slave. What shall be said to thee? Why, anything. An honorable murderer, if you will. For naught did I in hate, but all in honor. This wretch hath part confessed his villainy. Did you and he consent in Cassio's death? Aye. Dear General, I never gave you cause. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon. Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? Demand me nothing, what you know, you know. From this time forth I never will speak word. What not to pray? Torments will ope your lips. Well, thou dost best. Sir, you shall understand what hath befallen, Which as I think you know not. Here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, and here another. The one of them imports the death of Cassio, to be undertook by Roderigo. Oh, villain. Most heathenish and most gross. Now here's another discontented paper found in his pocket too. And this, it seems, Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain. But that, belike Iago in the nick came in and satisfied him. Oh, the pernicious caitiff. How came you Cassio, by that handkerchief that was my wife's? I found it in my chamber. And he himself confessed but even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire. Fool, fool, fool. There is besides in Roderigo's letter, how he upbraids Iago, that he made him brave me upon the watch, whereon it came that I was cast. Even but now he spake After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, Iago set him on. You must forsake this room and go with us. Your power and your command is taken off and Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest, till that the nature of your fault be known to the Venetian state. Come, bring him away. Soft you, a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service and they know it. No more of that. I pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate, speak of me as I am, nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak, of one that loved. Not wisely, but too well. Of one, not easily jealous, but being wrought, Perplexed in the extreme of one whose hand, like the base Indian threw a pearl away. Richer than all his tribe, of one whose subdued eyes, albeit unused to the melting mood, drops tears, as fast as the Arabian trees. Their med'cinable gum. Set you down this. And say besides, that in Aleppo once, where a malignant and a turbaned Turk beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat, the circumcised dog, and smote him thus. [groans] Oh, bloody period. All that's spoke is marred. I kissed thee, ere I killed thee. No way but this. Killing myself, to die upon a kiss. [laughs] This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon. For he was great of heart. Oh, Spartan dog. More fell than anguish, hunger or the sea, look on the tragic loading of this bed. This is thy work. [laughs] The object poisons sight, let it be hid. [laughs] Gratiano, keep the house and seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, for they succeed on you. To you, Lord Governor, remains the censure of this hellish villain. The time, the place, the torture. Oh, enforce it! Myself will straight aboard. And to the state, this heavy act with heavy heart, relate. [footsteps] [laughs] [dramatic music]
