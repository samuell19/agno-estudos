You're not going anywhere! Oh! [grunt] [smack!] OW! [THUD] - Stupid bitch! - NO! NO! You think you can defy me? [WHOMP!] Geez! - I'm never coming back! - I'll kill you! DONNA! [tinkle, crash] [panicked crying] [music] You'll get it like a whore! Oh... [crashing thuds] You're not going to do anything but drop that knife, you sonofabitch! Oh, yeah? And what are you going to do Go all Kung Fu on me? Want to fight me? [thunk] I'll show you how to hurt. [bash!] Ooofff! [gunshot!] - You missed me! - No! No! [scuffle] Ohhh...! UH! [thud!] UH! [bash!] [kick!] OH! [kick!] [gasping pants] [music] [music] [varoom!] [music] [music] [short burst of siren] [music] [knock, knock, knock...] Walter. [interior sound of TV] Walter, it's Curtis and Bear. [knock, knock, knock...] We've got to serve you with a restraining order to stay away from Beth. It's almost six. He's drunk. Wa-a-a-lter! Walt! Curtis: Where are you Walt? What I'd tell you? Blind stinking drunk. Walter. [TV in background] Come on, shake it up, buddy. [thwack] [background TV] Let's... Aw! Aw! Crisp! Phoo! Ohhh... Geez! Never would have figured Walt for a suicide. [TV] What are you doing? Checking evidence. Ah...! That's whisky, all Hey, we got to dust that for fingerprints. - Fingerprints? - Yeah, in case we're looking at a murder here. Sheriff: There hasn't been a murder in Corinth for thirty-five years. Not since Merle Stoat shot his old man and called it a hunting accident. Well, this ain't no hunting accident. Don't give me any of that CSI crap, Curtis. This ain't Portland. [click] You want a murderer? Talk to his wife. [footsteps] Hey, what about Walter? It's late. He's not going anywhere...'til morning. It's a cool night. [footsteps] [plunk] Whoo. [footsteps] [music] Beth: I'm sorry, but I just can't see Paul Newman kissing Robert Redford on the side of a mountain. Missy: That is my point. Today's actors are more dedicated to their craft. Beth: Kissing a man doesn't make you dedicated. - It makes you gay. - Oh. Joanie: I think that's right, Missy. I'd take Paul Newman over those two young cowboys any day. [footsteps] Those boys weren't cowboys. They were sheep herders. Beth: Uh... they were herding more than sheep. [laughter] [knock, knock, knock...] Wendy: I'll get it. [footsteps] - Curtis. - Hi, Wendy. [click] What brings you here at this hour? Ladies. Beth, do you mind if I have a word with you? Um... whatever it is I'd prefer you say it to all of us. Curtis: Okay, um... Uh... Beth, we just... we just found Walter up at the house. He's dead. [music] Well, forgive me if I don't break down. [music] You've been here all day, Beth? Yes, she has. We all have. Look, I don't like this any more than you do. But the abused wife of a murdered husband has got - to be considered a suspect. - He was murdered? Yeah. He was shot in the Okay. We're going to want to get your statement in the morning. I'm not going anywhere. [music] [background traffic] So, uh... we're still on for Saturday night? Absolutely not. Oh. Aw, you're kidding. Of course I'm kidding. I'm not going to let you off the hook that easy. All right then. Saturday night it is. [music] [music] [bar music] Carl: You going after that buck contest this year, Bear? Think you'd be tired of losing by now, Carl. I'm always happy to take your money. Ha, ha, ha. Not this year. I don't want to scare you but I saw a twelve-pointer sitting right on the edge of my property. Like hell you did. Twelve points is a hell of a rack, Carl. Ha, ha, ha. Tell you what. I'll take it over the rack of that Wendy Brown down at that Comfort House. Ha, ha. Well, maybe that's why your wife's staying there, huh? Harley: I'd kill Cindy before I'd ever let her stay at that city woman's place. Speaking of the contest, Walt won't be part of it. Shot himself in the head with a twelve gauge. [laughter] Well, you think that's funny, do you? Well, it's a joke, right? [laughter] He's dead, Carl. I just came from his place. He really killed himself? That's right. [bar music] [dog barks] [footsteps] Sharon: Here's the nail gun. I found it in a box under a pile of Gary's old disco albums. Wendy: Thanks, Sharon. Are you sure h - me borrowing it? - Absolutely not. He hasn't used it since we moved west. Well, this should speed things up. I'm tired of paying out money in rent. Spoken like a true city girl. Do you miss Boston? No, not really. I was out there last month and... everything about it just... reminds me of our son Bradley. How old was he? When he got sick? Seventeen. He was about to start at Boston College on a scholarship to be a photojournalist. - Are those his? - Yeah, they're all Bradley's. - Oh, they're beautiful. - Yeah. Yeah, he loved going out into the country and shoot... Photographing old farm houses. Yeah, he loved the textures of the old hand-made things. He used to say that all the secrets of the house were revealed in their textures. Well, they're true works of art. Yeah. Oh. This... This is Bradley. Right after we moved here. I lost my younger sister about a year ago. - Oh. - That's why I moved here. How did she...? Oh, uh... [whomp!] It was, uh... a drunk driver. Oh, I'm so sorry. [music] Wendy: Ready? One, two, three. [grunts of exertion] Joanie: I can't believe we're actually building a house. Why is that so hard to believe? Carl's a carpenter and he's always going on about how hard the work is. Well, you don't need a man for anything. Beth: Well. I can think of one thing you need him for. Wendy: Yeah. But that's still a choice, not a need. Looks dead on perfect to me. [music] Good job, ladies. I don't think you could have done it any better if you were men. [giggles] [slap] Okay, let's go frame another one. [click of door] [footsteps] Finally. Problem, Fallon? Oh, come on, Fallon. If you can't hold your breakfast just go sit in the car. Curtis: Huh. What the hell's your problem, Curtis? My problem is he's got no hair on his wrists. Sheriff: Well, maybe he can't grow it there. Sheriff, this is Walter Jackson. The man's got a pelt on him like a woodchuck. Whatever hair he had there, got ripped out. You know, I'm no doctor, but I tend to lean towards cause of death... shotgun to the head over missing wrist hair. No. I think his arms were taped down when he was shot. I mean, if you look at the angle of the head wound, it would imply to me the gun was held at this sort of angle, right? Now, if Walter shot himself, he would h Don't tell me how Walt Jackson held a gun. I hunted with the man since he was ten years old. If Walt wanted to kill himself he could have done it six ways to Sunday. Doesn't mean it was suicide. His wife left him. He was drunk, miserable. lonely, and renovating. Maybe we should call the State Troopers in anyway. Just see what they think. This is our town, our business. Now I don't know what the hell you think you see here, but I'm the Sheriff, and I see a suicide. Come on, Fallon. [music] [bang!] [scream] [bang!][scream] [bang!] [scream] That damn scarecrow moved! It would help if you'd kept your eyes open. Joanie, you just need to pretend that it's Carl. Impossible... with that zucchini? Okay, Missy. Come on. You're up. No. I... I don't want to touch it. A gun can't hurt you if you know what you're doing. I grew up in Philadelphia where everyone has a gun, knew what they were doing, and it didn't stop people - from getting killed. - This is about protecting yourself. [sound of approaching car] I moved to Oregon after college to protect myself. I met and married Peter. You see how that's worked out. Um... I've got a bad feeling about this. Why don't you ladies go pick up the tools and lock them up in the barn and I'll talk to Curtis. Curtis: Looks like I interrupted something. Building self-esteem is 24/7. I mean teaching these women to shoot a handgun. Their husbands all have guns. Yeah. But you don't hunt with a nine mill Glock. You don't get beat up when you're holding one, either. Fair enough. So, you think you're qualified to teach them? [click] [gunshots] [scream from Joanie] [gunshots] Joanie: Whahoo. Wow. [claps] Works for me. Although I'd be expecting a little fallout from their husbands. We're building a shelter out here for battered women. I'm trying to teach them how to be independent and not worry about 'fallout' from their abusive husbands. When did you move out to Oregon? - Nine months ago. - Yeah. You see, I don't think you realize just how rank some of these guys can be. I realize they beat their wives. Look. I didn't come here to argue. Why did you come here? The Sheriff doesn't agree with me. He'd rather trust his gut than the evidence. I think someone murdered Walter Jackson. I'll need to ask Beth a few more questions... about making arrangements for Walter's body, not her involvement. I'll let that go. Damn, woman. I thought you were a psychologist, not a lawyer. [music] I'll see you later. Might want to think about joining the Rod 'n' Gun Club. I tried. It's good ol' boys only. You ready to do it again? [giggles] Ohmigawd, its head's off. Aim for his heart. Harley: Sn [running footsteps] Carl: You know, I'm truly sick of all these foreigners coming up here and buying our property. Sheriff: Oh, what do you care, Carl. You get plenty of work from them. Carl: It's all nickel and dime handyman crap there. You know sometimes I'm tempted to go on unemployment just so I don't have to look at them. Harley: I'm sure they feel the same way about your ugly puss, Carl. [laughter] Carl: You know what, Harley? Harley: What's that? Not everybody likes kissing Portland ass like you do. [pow!] Carl: Oooof. [thud] [thock] All right, Harley. That's enough. Now that's funny. [laughter] [footsteps] Wendy: Wendy: It's no wonder there's so much abuse up here. Who do those little boys have to look up to? Oh, it's tradition like how they start drinking after they kill something. Animals sense fear, Missy. Men like that... they're nothing more than animals preying on your fear. Ignore them, you take away their power. [running footsteps] Joanie ready to come home yet? No, Carl, she's not. Oh, oh. You know, accidents have a way of happening up here, especially during hunting season. Sheriff: Better watch yourself, Carl. You wouldn't want to give Miss Brown the wrong idea. About hunting season. Although if you are going to be near the woods, it's a good idea to wear something red. Come on, boys. Coffee. Get out of my way. Harley: Curtis tells me you know how to handle a weapon. Maybe you can teach me. [laughter] [giggles] Thank you. Missy: How did you learn how to build a house? Wendy: Books. Anything you want to learn you can read about it. The last book that Joanie read was 'Green Eggs and Ham'. That's only because Carl needed me to read it to him. It doesn't hurt that I have an uncle who's a contractor. Missy, can you give me a hand? [footsteps] Beth: So have you heard from Carl lately? Joanie: No. But to tell you the truth I'm starting to miss him. Missy: I wish I could stand up to Peter the way you stood up to those guys at the market. You will. When you're ready. No, I don't even have the courage to face him. It's amazing what a little self-esteem will do. It's not that. I like myself okay. It's just... I know what Peter would do if he ever found me. When you're ready, maybe we can talk about Peter. Pull the pants off that monster, as my psych professor used to say. [rattle of door wheels] [zing!] Wendy: Oh! [screech of car tires] Wendy: Missy! Stay covered! [music] [] [slam] Where's Curtis? Uh.... Search me. Sheriff! Someone just took a shot at me. Well, if I was ten years younger I'd take a shot at... They tried to kill me. - How did this happen? - They shot at me from the woods behind my barn and barely missed me. - Did you see anybody? - No, I didn't. They took off in some dark-colored pick-up truck before I could see who it was. Anyway, I find it a little coincidental that Carl chose this morning to school me on hunting accidents. Are you accusing Carl of trying to shoot you? Does Carl drive a dark-coloured pick-up truck? Miss Brown. It's hunting season. People are firing guns in the woods all the time. I don't scare easy, Sheriff. And I sure as hell won't be intimidated enough to turn my back on Joanie. [music] Wendy: He was trying to scare me. If he wanted to kill me, he could have. - I'll talk to him. - No, it's okay. I can handle Carl. Although I don't know if I can handle the local hoedown. It's the annual fund raiser for the fire department. You said you wanted the people of this town to accept you. Trust you, right? Square da Well, it's... as long as you don't start rapping. [country music] Whoooah! Let's have some fun! Say hello to your partner. Allemande left your corner, now face your partner, do-si-do your partner, allemande left your corner, face your partner, right and left around hand over hand. Meet your partner, promenade that gal and when you're home, face it. Square your set, and yell, all right! Everyone: All right. [applause, laughter] So, whew. Fun, huh? Yeah. Oh, come on, you'll feel differently after the Sadie Hawkins acey-deucey. That does not sound like a dance. Oh, excuse me. I'll be right back. Sharon: Ah, huh! Oh, I was hoping you'd come. Yeah, wel But I guess I have to brush up on my square dancing skills before anyon Yeah, well. I know how that feels. Everybody manages to avoid me since Bradley died. Caller: Seasoned dancers only to the dance floor. I'll talk to you after. [multi-footsteps] Curtis: You have got to try this. Wendy: Did you make them? Caller: Mr. Music, please. No, I didn't make them. [laughter] [country music] Sheriff: Whooo. [country music] Now, bow to your partner. And bow to your corner. And circle to the left, now here we go. Dance all night, and here we go. Allemande left your corner lady, Quickly promenade your baby. He is quite the caller. Oh, yeah. He knows what he's doing. Sheriff: And when you're home, back to your square. Re-adjust your underwear. Whooo. [music] Yes, I moved here from Los Angeles nine months ago. So you're an Angelino, then. I guess you could call it that. Although I'd love to shake that title. You can't change what you are. I'm fifth generation. Bob is sixth, and won't let me forget it. Wendy: So Sharon finally came, huh? It's not like h She usually stays away from large gatherings. Do you think it's because people are so uncomfortable with their son dying? I wouldn't know. [music] Beth Jackson told me about you. She said I can trust you. Absolutely. Would you like to go outside and talk? No. I... I don't think I could do that. Would you like to come by Comfort House and visit Beth? Are people allowed to do that? Of course they are. It's not a place to hide out. It's just an optr women who want to make a change in their life and don't know how to do that. How would someone... I mean if they wanted... Harley: Cindy, let's go! - Hi, honey. - This is Wendy Brown. - I know who this is. This is the first time Carl's ever missed a dance. Why do you suppose that is? Maybe because he's humiliated by the way he treats his wife. He treats his wife the same way I do. Like a wife. I said, let's go! Get the kids! Carl beat Joanie just like Walt beat Beth. Is that how you treat your wife? That's how I treat anybody who gets in my way. You got that? Let's go! [background music] What was that all about? I'm pretty sure that was a spitting contest. Oh, come on. [music] [music] [car approaches] Curtis: You made it. I was worried the square dancing might have scared you off. They can get a bit hicky. [car door clicks open] On the contrary. I thought your do-si-do was wicked sexy. Oh. [laughs] Well, if you think that was sexy you should see me on disco night. Come on in. I just took the bread out of the oven. - You made bread? - Yeah. What else are you supposed to have with lamb chops and plum sauce? Ho, ho, ho. And lamb chops. If I didn't know any better I'd think you were looking to get lucky. Oh, well, you brought red and white. I could say the same about you. [laughter] [footsteps] [door clunks closed] Wendy: Those lamb chops were wonderful. Where did you learn to cook like that? My mom. She was a frustrated chef. Never got the training to follow her dream. What about you? You're smart, educated, kind of cute. You could have started a shelter anywhere. Why here? My grandparents had a farm not far from here. I used to come visit them during the summers. I always thought this place was heaven. And then, one time, when I was nine, I saw this woman at the market who's face was all beat up, bruised. And she had the most beautiful green eyes. They were so sad. She caught me looking at her. And she smiled. Completely unaware of why I was staring. And then her husband came up behind her and she quickly turned away like she was afraid that I might try to talk to her. And when they were leaving, she looked back... kind of embarrassed. And somehow I realized in that moment, she wasn't sad because someone beat her. She was sad because she was trapped. And that image has never left me. I just wanted to be able to help women like her who didn't have anywhere to go. Did you know that a third of all homicides against women are committed by their husbands or their boyfriends? But what we have here is a murdered husband and a wife. Do you think Beth killed him? Somebody did. Well, if she did, she was acting in self-defense under the laws of our country. It's sounds like you are condoning murder. I'm condoning protecting yourself by whatever means possible. Well, I hope you don't ever feel the need to protect yourself from me. [music] Why would I need to protect myself from you? No. I just meant... - I'm sorry. - No, it's... I'm sorry. Oooph... Thank you for dinner. [kiss] Good night. [footsteps] [sound of car engines] [click] [slam] [car engine starts] [footsteps] [rev, rev] [varoom] [laughter] Beth: Ohhh... look who's sneaking in after curfew. Joanie: We were getting worried about you. All alone... in that cabin with that animal, Deputy Curtis. [giggles] Do you know anyone who drives a black pick-up truck? Beth: Every guy up here drives a pick-up. Every guy we know, anyway. Where's Missy? Beth: Oh, she's working at the art gallery in Eugene until ten. Wendy Wendy: We need to find her a job around here. Beth: Um... where's the carving knife? You can't cut a pizza with a carving knife. Sheriff Trapp came by today. He's asking all kinds of questions about Walt. Where I was. If Walt ever talked about killing himself. Why I was staying here. He knows damn well why you're staying here. Did you tell him how Walt used to beat you? He thinks we're all living in some kind of lesbian commune or something. [giggles] You know, the truth is. I'm glad Walt's dead. For the first time since I married him, I can sleep through the night. [music] [music] [BANG!] [THUD!] [] Curtis: Rod Morwick and his brother found him a little while ago. Rifle shot to the head. Looks like somebody was hunting him. - How do you get that? - I found some boot prints about 30 yards in that direction. The position of Carl's body and the angle of the head wound indicates that that's where the kill shot came from. Sheriff: Boot prints? Curtis: Yeah. I make it out to be a military boot, about size ten. Every hunter in this dumb No, these aren't the kinds of boots that hunters wear. Oh, is that right? And what kind of boots do hunters wear, Mr. CSI? All right. Dead body in the woods. Must be hunting season. Who'd want to kill Carl? I think the list of who wouldn't want to kill Carl - might be a little shorter. - His wife, Curtis. Joanie. Oh, come on. You can't think Joanie would kill him like this. I might. If it wasn't for the fact that it's the second dead husband of a wife that's staying at that Comfort House. And I think it's time we talked to your girl friend. [music] Beth. Beth. We have company. Do you know where Wendy is? Yeah. She went for a run up the street. Why? Is there a problem? I'd say there's a problem. Joanie, somebody shot Carl. [music] [music] [screech] [car horn blares] [music] So you're saying you had no reason to want to - see Carl dead? - No! I mean Carl would get drunk and he'd hit me. But I loved him. You loved him. I see. So what are you doing here, Joanie? Because he beat me, Sheriff. And nobody seemed to care about that. Except Wendy. And she was kind enough to take you in and - give you a place to hide. - Yes. Beth: That's right. - What else did she - do for you, Joanie? - What do you mean? Sheriff: Maybe she tried to eliminate your problems? One at a time? Wendy did not kill Walt and Carl. Well, it's a hell of a coincidence, don't you think? They both move in here, and both their husbands turn up dead. What about you, Missy? Your husband dead yet? [door clicks open] [footsteps] What's going on? We found Carl shot dead in the woods this morning. He was out hunting. Wasn't an accident. Where were you at daybreak today? Wendy: Sleeping. You got proof to back that up? Do I need proof to back that up? I don't like what you do here. Men and women disagree, they work things out. It's just part of being married. Someone like you comes along. Sticks her nose into private business. Starts people thinking. Wives move out. Husbands turn up dead. Who the hell are you helping, anyway? The women who don't know that they have a choice. To be happy. Sheriff: Are Beth and Joanie happy now? I don't think Beth and Joanie have been happy for a long time, Sheriff. And maybe you thought a couple of dead husbands - would change things. - Are you implying that I had something to do with their deaths? I guess that depends if whether they'd be dead if their wives weren't staying here. Ladies. [footsteps] [door slams] Wendy: I'm so sorry, Joanie. We're going to run a background check on her. [car doors open] Sheriff: Find out where she's from. Who she knows. And what she did. She didn't do it, Bear. How the hell would you know what she did? What do you really know about her? Better watch yourself, Curtis. [starts car] Or one morning you might wake up just like Carl and Walt. [sound of car receding] You don't think I had anything to do with it? You saved me. I mean, being able to come to this place. Carl was completely out of control and he was only getting worse. He would have killed me. Wendy. If you need an alibi, we're all here for you. [music] [bam, bam, bam...] Curtis: Hey. You look like you could use a drink. Thanks. Wow, it's looking good. You too. Just hope I get to finish it. If you're worried about Bear coming after you, don't. I won't let him. It's not Sheriff Trapp I'm worried about. There's been a pick-up truck hanging outside Comfort House and I have a feeling that it's the same guy. And I think whoever it is, killed Carl and Walter Jackson. What makes you say that? Remember when someone took a shot at me? Yeah, you thought that was Carl. Well, I did at the time because he all but threa me with a hunting accident outside BJ Market. But now, I think it was meant to look like he took a shot at me, giving me a motive to kill him. I think somebody's setting me up, Curtis. Okay, who would want to do that? I don't know. But whoever's in that truck, they've been watching me and they know my schedule. And they killed Carl and Walt when they knew I wouldn't have an alibi. Look, you'd better be careful, Wendy. I don't want to find you in the woods like I di Gary and Sharon's kid. Bradley? Yeah. He was shot in a hunting accident last year. He didn't die of an illness? No. We never figured out who did it. He was a good kid. No enemies. He was out wandering in the woods without a hunting vest. It's tragic, but it happens. What made you think he died of an illness? His mother. Sheriff: The point is, Fallon, you want to kill the thing, not destroy it. I mean nobody wants to be picking buckshot out of their turkey leg on Thanksgiving. Oh, oh. Looks like somebody gave you a ticket, Bear. Ha, ha. What are you sniffin', Fallon? We give the tickets. Yeah, I know that. It was just a joke. Better not be. [rip] "She's killed before." [crinkle] Get Curtis on the radio. Tell him to meet us back at the station. [rustle of paper] "Social worker Wendy Brown was exonerated of all charges in relation to the death of Jack Dubois, her brother-in-law." Your girlfriend tell you about that? She's not my girlfriend. - And no, she didn't. - That doesn't surprise me. Not with the sudden influx of dead bodies around here. Well, this doesn't mean she was involved. Involved? Oh, Curtis. Wake up and smell the pheromones. She is an angry woman with a history of murdering men she doesn't like. This says it was self-defense. Oh, well, I'm sure a social worker gets a lot of leeway in the legal system in California. But what happened to Carl and Walt had nothing to do with self-defense. Where'd you get this? Fallon: Oh, we found it on the... Sheriff: Internet. Fallon dug it up. Research, Curtis. I told you I was going to look into her past. It just turned up a hell of a lot more than I expected. What if somebody's trying to set her up? - Who'd have a motive? - You said it yourself. Somebody from her past. Hey, you're right. Maybe we should be looking for Mr. DuBois, the abusive husband. $gM250Fellon: Oh, uh... I don't think you read that whole article, Bear. Uh... DuBois is dead. Well, that is one hell of a piece of detective work, Fallon. Geez, between you and Curtis, I tell you, we got ourselves one hell of a CSI unit. Hell, we should start our own TV show. Ha, ha, ha. Curtis: The point is there's no way to tie her to the murders up here. This article means nothing. Nothing. The woman killed a man. She leaves her town to start a new life. Two of my friends wind up murdered. In my book, that makes her worth investigating. All right, I'll agree with you on that basis, but let me talk to her first. Sheriff: Why should I do that? Because she'll tell me the truth. Well, she didn't tell you the truth about killing Dubois. That's because I didn't ask her. [music] By the way, it's pronounced 'doo-bwa'. It's French. The 's' is silent. [whack!] [sound of approaching car] [whack!] [car door closes] Wendy: Hi, Curtis. I thought you asked me out here for business. I did. Winter's coming and the only heat I have is from the wood stove. So... Just busting your chops a little. So, what's this new information you have to talk to me about. [rustle of paper] [music] Wendy: Jack DuBois. He'd been beating up my sister for a long time. Of course, I had no idea how bad it was. You know, that's the thing about abused women. They get really good at hiding what's happening. Anyway, my sister called me. She was scared to death that he was going to kill her. So I rushed over there. UH! [thud!] UH! [bash!] [BANG!] [music] Wendy: Donna... Donna... [sob] My sister died in the hospital three days later, from abdominal trauma. That's when the DA decided not to press charges against me. Why didn't you tell me? Because I moved up here to put that part of my life behind me. It's nothing personal, Curtis. I just didn't feel the need to talk about something so horrible when it has nothing to do with my life now. And you've got Sheriff Trapp looking for any way he can tie you to Walt and Carl's murders. So he went digging in my past to find something to incriminate me with. He's just doing his job. That is not his job. The man can't stand me because I offer these women a different option other than getting beaten up by a bunch of sorry ass excuses for men. He's on a witch hunt. Look, Wendy... The Sh The Sheriff's just had two of his best friends murdered, whose wives just happened to be staying with you. It doesn't take a whole lot of cynicism to at least - consider you a suspect. - He doesn't consider me a suspect. He considers me a killer. [scrunch] Why don't you just take your article back to your boss and you figure out a way to nail me. [music] Wendy! Wendy! - Wendy, come on. - Leave me alone. I am on your side, Wendy. I don't need you to be on my side. I can take care of myself. And I sure as hell don't need a man to... [music] [music] I got a bad feeling about this, Bear. It's been too long. It hasn't been that long. How can you just sit there? We're in the middle of a double homicide investigation. And for all we know our main suspect could have killed Curtis and run off to Canada by now. [sigh] Mmmm... Whew... If I didn't feel so good I'd have to take you in on abuse charges. [laughter] Is that an insult or a compliment. Well, that is a rave. Hm. So you don't mind sleeping with a killer? No. I don't fit the profile of y With them, there was no sexual activity. And I'm not married to one of your house guests. I guess that just leaves Missy's ex-husband. Well, what about Missy's ex-husband. He could be the next victim. I don't know anything about him. She never talks about him. Except that he doesn't know where she is. [music] Maybe he's found her. If he has, he could be the guy in the truck. [music] [music] - May I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for - Peter Cramer? - Your name? - Wendy Brown. - I'll take it from here, Hilary. I'm Peter. How can I help you? Wendy: Do you know who I am? Yes, I believe I do. Why don't we speak in my office. [music] I know exactly who you are, bitch. You think I don't know what you're doing to my wife in that place? We have a little argument and the next thing I know she's living with you and telling me that it's over. No one tells me that it's over. No one. I tell them. [click of door opening] Peter: Thanks again... so much for coming in, Miss Brown. [music] [click] [music] [door bell rings] [music] Beth: It's Cindy. Cindy: I didn't know where else to go. Come in. Come in. You did the right thing by coming here. Joanie, could you get me a wet washcloth and a towel. That bastard. - How bad are you hurt? - Please, no, I'll be okay. Can you tell us what happened? I can't. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe now. You'll stay here tonight. Okay? And tomorrow, you can decide if you want to report him to the police. Beth: No. No. You're going to leave that sick bastard, and you're going to move in here with us. That's what you're going to do. Joanie: That's right, Cindy. He has no right to do this to you. Okay, let's just give her a little space for now. Why don't you go lay down, and we'll get some ice for that eye. [car horn blares] Harley: Open up, Gary! [honk] It's about time. [clunk] Open the damn door! Gary: We are closed, Harley, you know that. Harley: Not... [thud!] Not for me. This is my damn bar. If I give you a drink I'll lose my licence. I don't give a damn. Go home, Harley or I'll call the Sheriff. [music] [music] Harley is a psycho. He beats those poor boys of his like dogs. Walt used to say, if he couldn't kill animals, he'd be killing his neighbors. Does Sheriff Trapp know that? The only difference between Harley and Bear is the badge. I mean, I mean, boys are raised killing things...[CRASH!] Harley: CINDY! Where's my wife! I know she's here. Harley, you need to calm down. Where's my wife? She's fine. She... she's sleeping. She's had a really rough night. CINDY! WHERE'S MY CINDY! [sobs] Cindy, I want you to stay in here no matter what you hear downstairs, you understand? Joanie, lock the door. [slam] [click] Harley: Where's the other one? Wendy: I'm right here, Mr. Barnes. Don't move, or I'll have to shoot you. And I would be well within my rights to do so. CINDY! Cindy is staying here tonight. Beyond that it's up to her, not you. You are trespassing. So you leave now or I call the police. Harley: This ain't over. Not by a long shot. You know, it gets pretty dangerous jogging with them headphones on. [slam] [slam] [starts truck engine] People have been known to get run down like that. [sound of engine recedes] Beth: Shall we call the police? No. No. We'll handle our business ourselves. Wendy. That was incredible. Wendy: Did you see his truck? That's the one that's been stalking us. [music] [music] [clatter of falling objects] Freaking cow. Won't let me see Cindy. [clang, clang, clang...] [music] [music] [rattle of chains] [music] [music] [swoosh] HUH HIP! UHHH... OHHH...! [music] [music] Cindy: Good morning. Beth: Oh, hey. Here, have some coffee. [gurgle of coffee] Did you get any sleep? Wendy: I hope you're hungry. The first breakfast is always pancakes. - It's my own little tradition. - Can I call my boys? They're at their gammy's. I'm sure they're worried. Of course you can. There's a phone in the living room. I'll show her. [music] [truck engine] [door squeaks open] [slam] Hey, Harley! Harley! You out here? Harley! Where are ya? Hey, Harley, where'd you go? [music] Ach! Hell. [music] Cindy: I feel like I'm staying at a hotel. Trust me, it won't be like this if you decide to stay. Missy: We take turns, cooking and cleaning. And we work on the new Comfort House we're building. No, I don't think I could actually... stay. I think you should consider getting a restraining order against him. What good would that do? If he tried to come near you again, he would be arrested and jailed. How near? [laughter] [music] Sheriff: Finally. [music] Policeman: It doesn't look like your little heart-to-heart did much good. Fellon: We left him hanging there 'til you could see him, Curt. Sheriff: Watch your step. He bled all over the floor. [music] Now Harley's a good 250 pounds. Take a hell of a strong man to hoist him up like that. Curtis: Oh. So you don't think it was Wendy, then? Well, not by herself. [clank] A ten-year-old kid could lift him up with this rig. Geez, Curtis, you're not doing your girlfriend any favours. I'm using the evidence to solve the case. Not shape it to fit my suspicions. Oh, is that right? Well, maybe you'd like to have a look at this evidence. Fallon. [music] Now that... cut his throat. Look familiar? No, it doesn't. Looks like a carving knife to me. The kind my wife used to carve a turkey. Then maybe we should question your wife. - You son-of-a-bitch. Fallon: Calm down, Bear, he didn't mean nothing. Sheriff: I don't have to take that crap from you! You are suspended! Suspended for what? Not wanting to railroad an innocent woman? Insubordination to a superior officer. Is that what you call searching for the truth? Insubordination. Sheriff: You wouldn't know the truth if it beat you on the ass. Unless her name was Weeenndy. [pow!] [chuck] [clunk] [thunk] Wendy: Is this a bad time? Yeah, you could say that. Cindy's in the car. We're here for a restraining order on Harley. Well, she isn't going to need it. We found him dead in his garage this morning... with his throat cut. [music] [music] Are you sure this is a good idea? Nope. But I know Trapp's going to try and pin it on me and I'm going to do my own investigating and see what I can find. It's Peter, isn't it? That's why I'm here. You think it's Peter. We'll talk about it later. For now, just keep an eye out for me. [music] [clatter of junk] [scared breathing] [music] [music] [crinkle, crinkle] Wendy: Huh! [shriek!] Missy: Oh! I'm sorry. I just thought I should help. You scared the hell out of me! [gasps] I don't know what I'm doing here, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. [music] Missy: What is it? Wendy: I don't know. [music] Rossy? Sharon: This is Bradley's. So what was it doing hanging in Harley Barnes' garage? Sharon: Wendy... Gary's got this deep resentment for Harley, and Walt and Carl. Wendy... He believes they killed Bradley and then pulled off his vest to make it look like a hunting accident. Why would they do that? I didn't believe him. I couldn't. I thought he was bitter for the way they treated us when we bought The Broken Leg. They didn't want their watering hole run by outsiders moving in here to change things. Ohh! They killed my baby! [wails] Wendy: Why not? Curtis: Because Gary's a friend of mine and I don't believe that he'd murder three people. But I would? No, I didn't say that. Look, even if Harley did shoot Bradley, there's nothing to say that it wasn't an accident. Then why hide the vest? Curtis: Because he was scared. Look, as ugly as it sounds that kind of things goes on up here. These guys get drunk, go out hunting and shoot anything that moves, including people. I see. To hell with justice. Look. What is it that you want me to do? Go up to him and say, "Hey, Gary, how's it goin? By the way did you murder Walt, Carl and Harley?" Yes. Look, take your case and your evidence to the Sheriff, all right? I'm suspended. I don't have any evidence. Well, that could be a problem if you're accusing people of murder. I know how you could help me get some. Curtis: Hey, Gary. Gary: Hey, Curtis. Wendy. Are you here to drink or eat? Curtis: We're on business, actually. Yeah? We found Harley murdered in his garage. Murdered? How? Someone cut his throat, the night that Cindy moved in with Wendy. The thing is, Gary, we f the garage that may indicate that... you were involved. Hah. Me? Ha, hah. [clatter of ice jugs] That's ridiculous. Maybe so, but I'm still going to need a DNA sample from you. Okay. Ha, ha. [clatter of ice jugs] [click!] It's not go Gary, what the hell are you doing? They killed my boy. They got what they deserved. Curtis: Gary, put the dam It doesn't matter any more. I did it for Bradley. Once a man starts killing it doesn't stop. - Put the gun down, Gary. - I can't do that, Curtis. I'm too full of hate to care anymore. Bradley would never say something like What do you know about Bradley? I've seen his work. His art. I know that he showed us how he viewed the world through his photographs. Gary, your son... was about love. And life. Not hate. Please don't ruin his legacy with your anger. [slap] Huh. I'm sorry. I knew they did it. They had to die. [music] Oh, Gary. What about Sharon? Does she know about this? No. No, she has no idea. She gave up on me after we buried Bradley. She gave up on our marriage. [music] I'm sorry... sorry. [music] [knock, knock, knock...] [music] [ding-dong] [music] Sharon? [music] Hello? [music] Sharon? [music] Sharon... I came by to see how you were holding up. [music] I was glad when Walt Jackson was found dead. And Carl. I've been lying about Bradley's death for so long. I forgot the truth. I didn't have the courage to live with it. Parents are supposed to protect their children. My son was murdered. And I blame my husband for not protecting him. You did what you had to do... to survive. By denying the truth? Blaming my husband? Lying to everyone. I lied to you about how my sister died. It wasn't a drunk driver. The truth is her husband beat her to death in front of me. [gasps] And I shot him. Shot him dead. I understand why Gary did what he did. And I certainly understand why you lied about it. I felt like I was cheating Bradley by lying. I didn't know what else to do. [music] [varoom!] Wendy: Oh! [squeal of tires] Oomph! [music] Curtis, it was no drunk and it was no accident. Someone tried to kill me. Okay, look. Don't get testy. I'm just trying to get the facts straight. Like for starters, why? Because somebody wants something about Bradley's death to stay buried. Gary already confessed to killing the three guys who shot his son. Who's left? Apparently whoever was in that truck that tried to kill me. [deep sigh] All right, what do you want me to do? You saw the place where Bradley was killed, right? Yeah. We had to bag him. What can you tell me about it? It was a spot in the woods. No different than any other. Although I do remember it being a little suspicious - at the time, I guess. - Why? His mother said he liked to take pictures of farm houses, right? We never found a camera. And there was a farmhouse nearby that burnt down, the same day. The same day? Yeah. We had no reason to think they were connected. I mean... - Who owned the house? - I don't know. They sold it shortly after the fire. Well, that's where we start. I'll go talk to the owners and... You can't. There's nobody there. The new owners never rebuilt. Well, how do we find out who bought it? I guess, the only realtor in town, Ann Hoffman. Ann: Okay... Ahh! Oh, of course! Alice and Ray Burke. They didn't want to sell it. But after the fire they had no choice. They didn't have the money What do you mean they didn't want to sell it? They loved that house. Raised four kids in it. But once the fire burnt up all their memories, it was easy to walk away. The same thing happened to the Leach House, not three months later, a quarter mile down the road. You're kidding. I never kid when it comes to real estate. Were they bought by the same person? Um... Let's see. [clicking of keys] [thwack] The uh... okay. The Burke house was bought by Margie Malaprop. And... [clicks] the Leach House was bought by Season Gratton. Ann, could you give me a print-out of all the properties in that area bought in the past few years? Do you think they may be connected? [click of door opening] Hello? Beth? Joanie? Joanie? Missy? "...Cindy's until six." [music] [music] [dialing beeps] [phone rings] Hello. Wendy: You're not going to believe this. There were six properties bought all in the same area of that farmhouse in a little more than a year. Two burnt down. One was evicted. And another one died in a car accident. All six buyers turned around and sold their property to uh... Triple A Development just a few weeks after purchasing them. What's Triple A development? Well, according to their Website it's a development company planning on building a large condominium complex in an area centrally located to a number of ski resorts - in Oregon. - You mean like Corinth? Sure does look like it. Do you think they're involved in Bradley's death? I'd bet my life on it. I just don't know how. I need you to take me to where his body was found. Yeah. Be there as soon as I can. [beep] [clunk] Oh, Bradley. How do you fit into this? [music] [footsteps] This was where we found his body... face down. Like I said, this spot's no different from any other. Which way to the farmhouse? [footsteps] They could have easily carried Bradley's body through these woods and no one would have seen them. Tough to prove that now. This is it. This was where he was shot. - You think? - Yeah, I'm certain of it. He came here to photograph that house. And something happened. I don't know what. But he saw something. [music] Sharon: What is it that you're looking for? Wendy: I don't know. Inspiration? Clues? A photograph of the farmhouse I just saw. - Well, is it one of these? - No, it's not. But, do you have the camera he used to take these? No. He took it with him that morning. But... it wasn't with him when they found his body. Wendy: I'm going back to the farmhouse. [music] [music] [telephone rings] [clatter of wood] [phone's ringing] - Hello. Wendy: Curtis, I found it! I found Bradley's camera in the exact same spot - we were in yesterday. - Is there any film in it? No, it's digital. Somebody smashed it up pretty good, and the memory card is missing. But that shouldn't matter. If Sharon can confirm that it's his, then that ties him to that farmhouse - burning down. - It sure as hell does. I'm on my way over there right now. Listen, can you call Sheriff Trapp and tell him that I'll bring it in as soon as she IDs it? Curtis: You got it. - Thanks. [beep] Sharon: It's his. We gave it to him on his sixteenth birthday. What does it mean? It means that Bradley's death was no hunting accident. [weeps] Sharon. Can I see his vest again? Oh, yeah. [footsteps] What are you doing? When I found the camera, the memory card was missing. And I was hoping... Oh. [sound of approaching car] [door opens, closes] [footsteps] Missy: Hey. - Hey, where are you headed? I have a job interview, in Portland. That's great. Beth and Joanie still inside? No, they took Cindy grocery shopping. Her boys come back home today. So I'll be back in a couple of hours, and wish me luck. Good luck. [sound of car recedes] [footsteps] [music] [clicking of keyboard] [clicking of camera] [music] [clanking of gas can] [music] Carl: Hey, hey, hey. Who's that? He's got a camera. Harley: Hey. Hey. Who's that kid? Is he local? Sheriff: Harley. Harley, what are you doing? Harley! Sheriff: You just couldn't leave it alone, could you? Three men dead. Widows. Kids without fathers. A loving husband in jail for the rest of his life. And it all started when you moved up here. It all started when you killed an innocent boy. Sheriff: Harley! Yeah. That was unfortunate. [click, click] Poor kid was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But... business is business. [BANG!] [THUD!] [thump] [scrunch, crackle] [grunts] Carl: Harley... Harley: Come on. It's only a kid. Come on, get him out of sight. Harley and Walt dragged him back into the woods and took his vest. Damned idiots were supposed to burn it. [music] And it was all just a hunting accident. Until you came along. It was arson. Bradley saw it. Why? They wouldn't sell. Idiots. And they got a fair offer on it. My job was to try to find a way and make it happen. You're on the payroll of Triple A Development? And you... are just a little too well informed... [whack] Ooh, Ahh. [music] [music] [BANG!] [tinkle] [BANG!] Did I get you, Wendy? [music] Yes I did. [music] I wish I could say it was just business, Wendy. But to tell the truth, I'm going to chalk this one up... as personal pleasure. [thump] [click] OH! Ahhhh... Why don't you chalk it up to idiot hunter - drops gun and lives. - Huh, huh. [thunk] [music] Here you go. Hope you like potato soup. It's my mom's recipe. Well, if it's anything like your lamb chops, I just might marry you. Oh! So, tell me what happened. He confessed everything. Two counts of arson. The kickbacks. Bradley's murder. Even w Even what he did to you up at your farm. He's trying to cut a deal, turn State's evidence against Triple A, but... either way, he's going away for a long time. [music] I guess that means there's a Sheriff's position opening up, doesn't it? I don't know if I'm quite ready to call out those square dances just yet. [laughter] Oh, but I have some good news. [rustle of paper] Ann Hoffman has been taking up a collection to help you finish the new Comfort House. Look at that. And this, it's a list of donations for materials and labor. Looks like the people of Corinth are embracing what you're doing after all. So, I guess this means I'm not an Angelino any more. Well, let's not go too far too fast. [music] This is incredible. Oh. No. This, uh... This... is incredible. Ummmm.... - That's good. - Yeah? As good as my lamb chops? I'll let you know that in the morning. [music] [music]
