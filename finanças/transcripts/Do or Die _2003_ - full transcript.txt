(Sighs) (Gasps) That's the last of it. - What do you figure? - A week's worth? - Shoot your dose? - Yeah, but it was late. Better than none. Get the other two? - Take care. - OK, man. Later. (Motorbike revs) Our deal was three. You shot one. Take two more. Get out of here. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Forget about it. We'll just steal more. Gas tank? Booby trap, courtesy of Granttine. Be safe. (Woman) 'That was our first raid. 'We got a little Anzanol but we needed more. 'Here's how this works - 'lnfecteds need Anzanol every day. 'Lf they don't get it, they age a year every day. 'Cleans like it that way because Cleans don't need Anzanol.' (Dog barking) (PA announcement, indistinct) Take your gloves off. 'This guy figures Jack's an Infected, he's looking for the stain. 'Granttine, the maker of Anzanol, puts a blue dye in the drug. 'That way Cleans can keep track of Infecteds.' Nice night, huh? - Not really. - Zone stamp. One for the Governor. - You bet. - All right, go on. 'Jack works for Granttine. He's a production supervisor. 'He knows how they make Anzanol. 'Not many people know that. 'One guy knows better than anyone.' - (Man) Dr Grant? - Yeah. Sir, an Anzanol truck's been robbed, Bluelands Region 3. - The entire truck? - Yes, sir, 600 units. Get him. It's Ethan Grant. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Governor, we're having a small production problem. There'll be no deliveries of Anzanol in the Bluelands on the 25th. Yeah, a truck. First in five years. Well, this clarifies who's in charge. Stay Clean. - Thanks, Logocki. Good night. - Dr Grant. We have plenty of Anzanol in reserve. RADpunks want my attention, they got it. 'Ethan Grant invented Anzanol. '20 years ago, a genetically engineered virus escaped from a lab, 'mutated and became The Blight. 'No rhyme or reason who got it but the bug gave the world a pounding. 'So Grant's discovery was manna from heaven. 'Nothing stops Rapid Age Disease but Anzanol slows it down 'if we shoot every day. 'That's Jack's wife, Ruth. 'She can't remember a time before Cleans and Infecteds, 'she was just a kid when The Blight hit. 'She was lucky, she didn't get RAD. Now, she never will. 'Jack wasn't so lucky.' That's the guy. Take it easy. Let's just see who he meets. I'm sorry. Are you OK? (Driver) What the hell's he doing with that Infected? (Delighted gasp) - How was your trip? - It was great. We talked sports, we talked shop and because there were no women, we talked women. VP of Operations loved my ideas. - Was that a grey hair that I saw? - No. Yeah, it was! A whole bunch of them. No. It's OK, it makes you look distinguished. Thank you. I'll still love you when you're old and grey. Look. Oh. Ho-oh! It's very nice. Aren't I supposed to buy you little trinkets like this? - We bought this for me. - Oh, OK. - To celebrate. - Celebrate? Oh, no, what did I forget? It seems that your vasectomy wasn't as complete as you thought... Daddy. That's amazing. (Ruth giggles) So it's for certain? You've talked to the doctor? Yeah. I'm a little scared. - Of what? - Me being a mom. Ruth, you spend every day around kids at school, you'll be fine. - But not my own. Ours, Jack! - Ours! Ooh! - What? - This is what you want, right? Yeah, if you do. Only if I do? I just wish that I had more time, that's all. Can we go outside? Come on. What if I told you I needed more time before I could be a father? Jack, you're gonna be fine. You're such a sweet guy. It's not that. Oh, man. Come on. (Ruth) What? Stay behind me. (Ruth screams) Granttine wants this guy alive! Come on! Come on! - Not so fast. - Oh, Jack! Stay away from her! - Hit him! - Oh! - Halt! - Damn! Come on. Let's get out of here! (Groaning) They busted my implant. (Ruth) What? - Ruth, I'm an Infected. - What? Are you all right? Oh, man, a Crossover. Shut up! (Ruth) You need an injection. - Get me Anzanol! - Officer G14... It's too late, it won't help. Then a doctor. Ruth, they don't care. Yeah, back it right here. Move along. Let's go. - Why didn't you tell me? - I couldn't, sweetheart. Don't tell them about the baby. They sterilise, then it's prison. This is your Crossover. - You're under arrest. - No! Damn! Damn it, Infected. Come here. There's a chance for a... cure. I was close to a cure. I need to get in here. - Saint Rita's. - Where? It's in the Bluelands. Iona's there. Keep it secret, love. - All right, come on. - Jack. Jack! Dave, catch me later, when nobody's just knocked over an Anzanol truck. Where's your social responsibility? Social response - I leave it at home. - Hello. You OK? - (Electronic voice) 'Door secure.' - Do you want a water? - Please. Marrying an Infected. I bet your parents didn't approve but it's not illegal. Not reporting an implant, that's illegal. - I didn't know that Jack was Infected. - Oh. Right. I'm Alan Yann. Detective. - What about his cream? - What? Anzanol concentrate. Implants only pump cream, he'd need refills. I never saw him do anything like that. - How long did you know him for? - Two years. We were married last April. Yeah, your wedding. Did his parents make it? No, of course not. They're dead, right? Did he rapid-age? I don't... No. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that he did. Even with concentrate, you'd live half a normal life span. Unless somebody murdered him first. Infecteds can't be murdered, the law doesn't recognise it. OK. (Clears throat) I'm going to need a thumb tap for our files. - What? - It's just a blood test. Mandatory Rcon procedure. Can I have your thumb, please? Thank you. You have any health problems that are gonna skew my test? There you go. Thought about why the bounty hunters picked your husband? Someone knew. Your husband was a Crossover, supervising Anzanol production at Granttine. This is a big deal. - Yann. This the wife? - Yes, sir. The City's charging you for emergency expenses. $4,743.92. - Cash. Before you're released. - My God. You married him, lady. Captain. It's OK, I'll sign for her. We have an address. You gonna pay the grieving widow a visit, is that it? (Door shuts) - 'Door secure.' - Sorry about that. Could Jack have been cured? - There's no cure. Jack was proof. - Fact or opinion? It takes a savvy Infected to get that far inside I am sorry. (Glass smashing) You lying son of a bitch! - Oh, honey. - Damn it. I'm so sorry. Come here, come on. It's OK. Come on. - (Sobbing) - Oh, I'm so sorry. Mama. Mama. It's OK. Take your time. (Retching and coughing) (Toilet flushing) You stole my life. - The wife didn't know jack. - Do you think he was a loner? Probably pilfered Anzanol for friends but he didn't run with RADpunks like her. - Lab results. - The mystery girl. She'd eat you alive, Ogilvy. Look at that. He could have got his implant from a dozen sources. Hold it. Stan, this blood tap on Ruth Hennessey, is that confirmed? I ran it twice, the woman's pregnant. As if we didn't have enough to deal with. (TV) 'Rioting erupted at border stations 'as Infecteds without zone stamps attempted to enter the Citizone. 'This unprecedented day-long... ' Dr Booth's agreed to do it tonight after his staff has gone. - Mom, I need some time. - (TV) '... shipping by tomorrow.' (TV off) You have an Infected thing inside you. What would you wait for? - I don't want to do anything I may regret. - Like marrying an Infected? I didn't know. Did you? You don't remember where you were born but I do. - Yeah, I've heard it before, Mom. - No, no, you listen. Before there were Infecteds and good Citizens, we didn't have a whole lot of momentum and then comes the Blight and fortunes change and your father and I finally get a break. - Yeah, I get it. - Then act like it. I hope to God you didn't catch RAD from him. - It's not contagious. - I've heard of cases. A woman... Either you're born with it or you're not. - This foetus isn't doing anything to me. - Really? It's my baby. Mine. I decide. When you decide, remember this. If you have that baby, you can forget about me. You are on your own. (Car approaching) I'll get the tech kit, you check the door. - Sterilisation unit. - Oh, no. - Tell them I'm gone. - I'm not getting involved! I'm not! - (Doorbell) - Rcon. We have a warrant. (Mother) Just a minute! (Woman on radio) 'Ln response to civil unrest, 'Rcon has initiated a curfew beginning at dusk. 'Lnfecteds will be required to vacate the Citizone or remain indoors. 'Those with worker exemption will be allowed limited mobility in the Citizone.' (PA) 'Attention, you are about to cross the Bluelands/Citizone border. 'Stamps are not sold in the Bluelands. 'Citizens, review your stamps prior to leaving the Citizone.' How do I get zone stamps? Apply to your local zone tax office. Open Monday to Friday, closed holidays. I can't get them here? No. Got the stamp? This isn't gonna work. You just come back around this way. Hold on there, honey. Look, I got all the zone stamps you'd ever want and I see you got that SUV. I need a ride. You know the Bluelands? It's my backyard. Yeah. Yeah, OK. Thanks. That was downtown. The mother doesn't know squat. I figure Hennessey split off-zone for an abortion. - Maybe. - I'll call Border Force. Let her run. We got bigger fish to fry. I worked this area before the Blight. I saw no reason to switch territories. Infecteds need shoes, too. Factory direct. Is it dangerous? - You haven't left the Citizone much. - Why would I? You just get me to midsector. I got a special arrangement there with a classy gal. We swap for sample stock. - Why'd you stop? - The light's red. It's Bluelands. (Salesman) Punch it. Get out of here! You guys don't wanna do this! (Ruth screaming) Go, go! Get out of here! Get us out of here! Go on! Go on! That was my Nine West special order. - Where's Jack? - Question of the day, Kenji. Maybe we shouldn't rob another truck without him. - They stopped all the Anzanol. - Somebody else hit the A jackpot. Don't let Blanche rattle you, she's only a kid. (Knocks on door) - Henry! - Howdy, Blanche. - Who's that? - That's Ruth. The car broke down, she gave me a ride. - No Cleans in here. - I'm a Clean. - That's different. - I brought Guccis and a lovely calfskin. (Baby crying down hall) Damn. Henry, I missed you. (Muffled giggling) - Here we go. - Killing time. Hey, nobody dies. All right, we got one! (Driver) We got trouble, call it in. (Man) Truck 74, northbound, requesting assistance. I'm walking. She's walking. (Beeping) (Passenger) Look out! Stop! (Screeching brakes) I told you they'd hit it. (Woman) Get out! Get the Anzanol out. Kenji, you take him. That's one of your three? This is not for me. This is for you. Go help her unload the truck. - Don't you want some of your drug? - It'll kill me! No kidding. Crisp, stop it. (Motorbike revs) Lona. No. We'll bring him. - She just needed some nourishment. - This is good. - Hungry girl. - Yeah. I guess I am. - Didn't you miss me? - Of course I did. We got a guest. - Freeloader. - Hey, act like a lady. I guess you'd rather go to bed with her. Like I said, she's pretty young. Maybe I should go. Is there some place like a motel or some place safe that I could go? Yeah, back where you came from. Come on, you don't belong here. I'm pregnant. My husband that died, he was a Crossover. And one Infected parent means an Infected kid for sure. You gonna kill it? You don't got months to decide, it's sped up in you, ain't it? I don't know, I've never been pregnant before. Well, it is. (Cheering and applause) (Screaming) - Dr Grant? - (Applause continues) Another truck raid, sir. - Who knows? - The Governor. He says no disruption. What good is controlling things if they're not in control? Every scheduled delivery gets dumped. - Dumped? - To hell with 'em. And put out a bounty, a Granttine bounty, for the thieves. (Pained screaming, cheering continues) (Horn) (Raucous cheering) (Man on PA) 'Number two is your winning bet.' (TV) 'Good morning. Last night in a violent attack, 'the Bluelands Anzanol allotment was stolen in a massive raid by RADpunks. 'Granttine has provided Channel 1 'with a statement from Anzanol inventor, Dr Ethan Grant.' 'Once again it's my grim duty to report that because of RADpunk hijackings, 'Anzanol supplies will be short. 'The Citizens at Granttine are intensifying efforts to ease this situation. - 'Thank you.' - 'Granttine maintains raw materials... ' Damn that son of a bitch Grant. I'm sure they're doing their best. - How would you know, you Clean bitch? - I'd keep quiet right now. Day in, year out. - I'll find you some Anzanol. - Day in, year out. - You want to go to Saint Rita's? - Yes. (Sobbing) Day in, year out. (Hissing) That ought to do it. (Engine revs) (Radio) 'Anzanol shipments into the Bluelands won't resume until Thursday. - 'The extent of... ' - Damn! - There's plenty if they'd just release it. - Yeah. Why start now? Save it. You did good. Now you need to get our gear back. They're right. There's plenty of Anzanol. I wouldn't know... Citizen. (Radio report continues) (Motorbike revs) Find out. How are they gonna use it? - Same way they always use it. - Inject that? - Any way they can get their 2cc. - What did the lab say? Pure uncut factory grade. This was deliberate and it sucks. Save the personal opinions. Let's get this area cleaned up. It's out of control, Mueller. - What the hell's at Saint Rita's? - A cure for my baby. (Chuckles) - What's so funny? - Who are you kidding? Look around. Don't you think every Infected dreams of a cure? If there was one, wouldn't they know about it? Jack knew. He told me. - That's why he died a Crossover? - My baby isn't gonna be born Infected. Because you want it? You're spoiled, Ruth. Ask Blanche, life ain't fair. - You head that way, I'm off this trip. - What? It's Blanche, I gotta hustle Anzanol, get back. - But you said... - You take my gun. Zone stamps. You'll do fine. - I'll pay you. - I'm sure money's got you through life. - This ain't about money. - Please. We're both Cleans. You'd better start waving that pistola. If you find a cure, let me know. (Menacing laughter) Wait a minute, hold up. Where is Saint Rita's? Oh, thank God. A Citizen. Excuse me. Miss, can you tell me how to get to Saint Rita's? - I'll be damned! - I'll shoot. I swear to God I'll shoot. You're Ruth. - What? - You're Ruth Hennessey. Where's Jack? Jack? - Did he send you? - Jack's dead. Who are you? - Oh, my God. - Who are you? Lona. I'm lona. What? What the hell did he see in you? How did you recognise me? - That was last summer. - I know. I heard all about it. You were having an affair with him? And you were getting what - facials? Manicure? Shopping? Turn in. - Iona! - Hi, guys. How are you? Hi. Hi. Hi, Heather. - Hey, Tink. - (lona) Make it big enough for me, OK? Have fun. - I thought Border Force got you. - We had some, er, complications. Whoa! There is a hell of a lot of Anzanol here. Granttine wants the world to believe that's all of it. So Jack'll get us more from the factory any day now. Jack's dead. What? - How? - She'll tell you all about it. Who are you? Ruth Hennessey. - You knew Jack? - Yeah, like a brother. (Children) ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost ♪ But now am found... ♪ Where are you going? What? These kids don't know you and they should. You can tell them what Jack did for them. I don't know who Jack was. You know a part we don't. He was our best hope. - Jack was a liar. - He was protecting you. He could have crossed over, forgotten about us but he did something no one else has done, he got inside Granttine. To find you for a cure. I'm pregnant. You can have your baby here. We don't have a cure. I don't know if I want this baby. All right. - Is there something you want to tell me? - No. You and Jack have kids? No. What, then? He married you because he loved you, not to use you. I know how Jack felt about you. Don't you? Hey. It's plastered all over the Bluelands. So Granttine wants to help us out. Great. Ogilvy, I'm gonna teach you something. They're not bringing people back to us. So what? They're Crossovers, who cares? Crossovers or not, whatever he's doing to these people is... it's evil, man. Ever wondered how Bierce managed to drive off a cliff? Your partner had a lot of enemies, any Rcon cop does. OK, so some people didn't like him. I like to think he didn't die for nothing. Do you expect anything to change because of us? - We have a job. Keep a lid on the crap. - Yeah, a job for who? Who's our job for? Is it for a company? For Ethan Grant? Will you press for higher taxes, Mayor? I can't see Citizens tolerating another assessment. Then let's admit this transit line will never be built. - (Clears throat) - Dr Grant. Mayor Sloan, Citizens, if you're turning over tax rocks looking for dollars, you'll never find them. Instead, finance the Crescent Hill line by adding to the Bluelands line. If we extend Bluelands, we can bring more Infecteds into the Citizone, we tax them two zone stamps and increase the cost of Anzanol in public dispensers by 5%. Infecteds pay for everything. And who will fund this Bluelands extension, Dr Grant? Granttine will. In exchange for the 5% Anzanol surcharge. There's your answer. He's willing to spend over a billion dollars. - They like it. - Of course. - Nobody loses. - At least no Citizens. (Chuckles) I'm Rachel Underwood. Ethan Grant, hard-headed but softhearted. (Mayor and Citizen debating) "Until that time, the sin of infection remained hidden. "The Blight allowed those who were evil to be seen." - Do you believe that, Heather? - No, ma'am, I'm not bad. (Gasps) This baby's growing too fast for me. Tink! Read quietly among yourselves. I'm meeting someone. Walk with me. - Have you seen lona? - She's probably searching for cream. - What? - Anzanol concentrate. Sorry, you don't know, do you? Apparently not. Iona has an implant. - I thought she was a Clean. - That's the idea. Only with her it never mattered. She lives in the Bluelands, she never crossed over. OK, tell Dr Ehrhart I'm trying a new power supply. - It's beautiful. - It'll run forever but feed it every month. OK. Once the doctor's implanted it, give your stain time to disperse and then you get your assignment. You'll be proud of me. And remember, if this gets damaged, there won't be time to save you. That was an implant, wasn't it? (Motorbike revs) Somebody's gotta make 'em. Bye. See you later. - Wait here. - Can't I come? No. Iona. - Hey, Rachel. - I met Grant at the transit hearing. Good. What's this place about? This is Ethan Grant's real grade school. His family were parishioners here. That's not in his bio. Are you sure? He's weird, lona. He took me to his place, it's in the Granttine compound, and he strapped me into this really strange chair, kinda like a dentist's. I'm sorry. Look. The implant's right here. Does Grant trust you? - Maybe. - Good. (Whirring) (Sighs) Yeah, I liked it when Jack gave it to me, too. (Door opens) Lona? - Who's this? - Nobody. That was the cream, right? Anzanol? I didn't mean to disturb you, it's just... - What? - That's what I was worried about. (Whimpers) Another Anzanol raid, Yann. You got nothing! - What am I supposed to do? - (Clears throat) - What? - They found Ruth Hennessey's car. - Where? - It was stripped but... The gang's van was found here, gunner's body here and this is her car. What the hell is that? Saint Rita's Orphanage? (Groaning) Give me a baby! Give me a baby! Ruth, give me a baby! - Give me a baby! - (Screams) Feed the baby, Ruth. Feed the baby! (Gasps) "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee." Jack got closest because he was closest to Grant. So Grant is researching a cure? If you were rich, why build your factory in a crappy neighbourhood? Granttine desires no scrutiny, no accountability and they have no morality but I do believe they have a cure. And these, my dear, get us in the door. Tink. I don't need one of those. And I wanna help. We'll see. Santa's here. Look what I got for you. I like it. - Need some help? - I think you've got enough to carry. - There you go. - How do women do it for nine months? I don't know any who took nine months. Kenji, give me a lift with you? Let the women sort things out. Yeah, no problem. Here you go. I could go on a raid if you teach me how to ride. Ride? You're too pregnant. - Let me decide that. - All right. (Motorbike revs) One down, three up. Don't scratch it, OK? Ready? Go. I'll be damned! - What's up? - There they are. Come on. I broke water. The baby's coming. - Let's get inside. Are you all right? - I feel... I feel great! There it is. Over there. (Mueller) You better be right. - Let me get help. - No, you stay with me. You, er... just sit down, OK? - You OK? - Yeah. Come on, Rcon's coming, get inside. Let's go. Go, go, go! - How much am I dilated? - Er, this much. (Screaming) Now fast, one, two, three. (Whimpering) I should've taken Lamaze. Search from the bottom up. Call it out. Just breathe. That's it. (Officer) One, clear! (Gentle moaning) Damn. Rcon's here. Go. (Groaning) OK. OK, just breathe. Rcon. Infecteds, declare yourselves. Get your hands up. Put your hands down. (Screaming) Oh. I can see the head. Come on, push. That's it. Do it! (Officer) Rooms 13, 14, 15, clear! (Door bangs closed) Don't move! Hands up. - Put your hands up. - What? I'm Clean! Can't a guy take a leak? You go up. (Officer) Basement's clear! Moving up! (Baby cries) - You did it. - Can you cut the cord? Yeah. Look at his little hands, they're so beautiful. - (Doors slamming) - Jack Junior? Travis. My little Travis, are you hungry? Oh, my God, you already had it? (Baby wailing) - Bye, Travis. - Go! (Baby crying) (Mueller) Yann. Yann! Where are you? What do you got? There's nothing up here, Captain. Bunch of kids and losers. - That's right. - Let's get out of here. We got the stand-down order. Ogilvy. I want you to run a check on this place. Pronto. (Cars starting) (Mueller) Yann, get in here! (Officer) OK, we'll follow you. (Baby crying) - (Tink) It's OK. Shh. - What happened? He just came and then he left. Detective Yann, he knew me. - Hold him still. - No, no, he's gonna be cured. He needs an injection. Now. We gotta do it. It's OK. It's OK. Shh. There you go, little guy. ♪ Hush little baby, don't say a word ♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird... ♪ - Are you gonna hold his hand? - Yeah, right here. - It's OK, Travis. - It's OK. - OK, there we go. - Perfect. That's it. (Grunting) Ahh. You're gonna kill me. You know what I like. Tonight, you're gonna learn something new. You keep teasing me. What if it's a letdown? Not a chance. What's this? Just a cyst I had removed. It's a little scar. Hey. Thanks for baby-sitting. - He's a charmer, like his dad. - Yeah, a real charmer. - Where have you been? - The library in the Citizone. Check this out. Why do you think Yann didn't arrest us? Don't you think his partner's death is a little suspicious? - He's a lost soul, he's hiding something. - So? Rcon's nothing but lies. - I'm gonna talk to him. - The guy's Rcon. - Not in here. - Don't be so sure. Is that a '74? My father had one. - How'd you find this place? - You're in the book. Why didn't you arrest us? I saw two Cleans with an Infected baby, there's nothing illegal about that. Meet Travis. Thank you. How you doing, big boy? Tell me about Ethan Grant. - Looks like you, he's got your eyes. - Grant, Detective. - Grant? Grant's a great man. Why? - He is hiding something. He doesn't like Crossovers because people like Jack are poking holes in his kingdom. He's got a cure but he's not sharing it because that would shake up this sick world we're living in. Wow, that's very impressive. Did you and the mystery girl - rooftop - what's her name, by the way? - Why? - Why? She's my heart-throb. You don't believe me? I could have dragged her ass in. - Iona. - Iona. No last name? - You buy my theory, Detective? - Did you two cook this cure thing up? Jack told me. His last words. Miss Hennessey. Ruth. You gotta quit living that dream. Your baby's Infected, he's Infected forever. Now, if you wanna move back into the Citizone, I can clear up your paperwork for you. I need you to get me up close and personal with Ethan Grant. I'm sorry, are we old friends? Do I owe you something? Why would I do this? Because you owe it to your ex-partner, Paul Bierce. I know that he was murdered. - Bierce would have liked you for sure. - You bet your ass. Yeah, well, if you go up against Grant, you'll be betting yours. I think you're gonna have a great time. This is gonna be fun. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Rachel Underwood and Dr Ethan Grant. Thank you. Welcome, Citizens. Just a reminder that you have a few minutes left to bet. - On one, we have a Crossover bandit. - Hi. And on two, a baker whose loafing is over. (Laughter) Enjoy. Ladies and gentlemen, your finishers for round one. Come on, let's go. (Cheering) Down here. - No! - (Cheering) Right. Lean back. Feet secure. (Horn) (Announcer) All betting is closed. Feet and hands secure. All here gather to witness the wages of deception. Infecteds, reveal your true nature to the assembled good Citizens. Finishing begins. (Horn) Here, you can help. Press the button. Press the button. Press the button. (Piercing screams) Oh, my God. - (Horn) - Number two is your winning bet. You're next. What? Oh! No, wait a minute! Ethan! Ethan, please! So you're not gonna build my implant? Gotta earn it, Crisp. What?! You my guidance counsellor? Go charm somebody else, huh? I think you should go. Get a reward for pricks like you. - What are you doing here? - He's leaving. Everything all right? Yeah. Iona, what's wrong? Rachel's. Fatima smuggled it out. - What happened? - Well, they executed her. Iona, I'm so sorry. I told her, encouraged her. Stay with Grant, get close. You couldn't have known. We were that far from cracking into Granttine. Damn! Can you take me back to where you met Rachel? - Grant's school? - Why? Because it's all we have. All right. I really don't know what we can find here. Books. Records. I don't know. I need to tell you something. I wanna get straight about Jack and I. OK. We got our implants together to live in the Citizone, to do our little revolution. Only I hated it there. I hated being around Cleans, seeing Infecteds being exploited. When I moved back to the Bluelands it was over between me and Jack. Then he met you. So he was, you know, your man. Fair and square. Thanks. Now it's just me and the kids and what they need every day. What you need is a distraction. Like Detective Yann. Whoa. Look at this. (lona) "Broadway Episcopal Church." (Ruth) Here we go. - Grant's father. - He's a lot older. - What's this, five years later? - Year of the Blight. (lona) Dad's gone. Grant's father was Infected? That changes everything. So your cover's set. Here's a security pass for Miss Clair Gautier for tonight. - Gautier, perfect. - I set up an alias in the database. She's a teacher like you and your family's a big donor. Clever. Will you take him? Sure. Hey, Buster. Whoa! Check this out. Is that who I think it is? The Ethan Grant family. A year after the Blight. Ethan looks a lot older. And his father was what, a war casualty? So the history books say. - That's what got Bierce killed. - What? We thought she was murdered and Grant did it but we couldn't prove it, and Bierce wouldn't let it go. - And you? - Well, after Bierce died I just... I folded, I disappeared. Went back into Rcon. Figured I was waiting for the right moment or something. It's not over yet. Come here. Yeah. Bye. Well, you be careful, cos Travis needs a mother. Travis needs a cure. Clair Gautier. I'm Clair Gautier. (Woman) Start it now. Let's go, let's go. Ma'am? - That's beautiful. - Excuse us. (Man) One more, darling! Bellissimo, bellissimo! (♪ Swing) - I remember. - (Pass reader beeping) Clair Gautier. - OK, good Citizen, enjoy your evening. - Thank you. It's a pleasure. (Gasps) Oh! - Excuse me. - Darn! Oh... - I thought these were double-knotted. - Let me help. - You're... - That guy. - Clair Gautier. - It's a pleasure. - Do you dance? - A little bit. Well, let's... let's go and try. - Keep an eye out. - Will do. Iona. Be careful. - Iona. - Fatima. Great. I scored a big break. Stole this. Gets me into Grant's private quarters. Excellent. I have your injection. (♪ Swing) (Giggles with delight) That was fun! You're good. You make it easy. You work for the Animal Rights Fund? - I'm a teacher. - At a university? - What a charmer. Fourth grade. - I think I'm being conned. Oh... No, I'm sorry, I mean... Well, I find you... fascinating. Thank you. I can't believe that I'm talking with Ethan Grant. - (Laughs) - What will I tell my class? Tell them that I'm hard-headed and softhearted. My rep. Be what you like. I can keep a secret. (Whirring) (Distant clang) (Gun cocks) (Gunshot) That wasn't Kenji's gun. Here, you go out the back. Kenji? (Grunts) Get off. Off me! (Cries out) Ohh! That felt good. Again? Kenji! Dr Grant would love to meet a girl like you. (lona) Kenji! Can I give you a ride? Oh... I don't think so. Do you have plans tomorrow? - Yes, grading papers. - After that, how about dinner? Lovely. (Melodic beeping) I'll call you. That would be nice. - You shouldn't be here. - So arrest me. I met Grant. I have a dinner date, tonight. That's impressive. That's crazy impressive. Come in. Since I saw those photos I keep thinking you're right about a cure. Grant probably did beat RAD, the only person who ever did. It makes sense. His father died of it and we figure his mother was murdered. I'm a cop. I'm thinking motive. Why kill his mother? - A cover-up. She knew. - Maybe but... You know how family members make organ donations to relatives? - Yeah. - She was well and he was sick. So whatever she gave him or he took from her, it killed her. - A Clean mother and Infected son. - It's just a theory. But I want you to stay in touch. I know why I'm here, by the way. I'm your guardian angel. Ogilvy, do you know anything about a security clearance for a Clair Gautier? Your partner approved it. Granttine's inquiring. Got a picture? Hell no. Have Yann call me. Miss Gautier. Where's Dr Grant? - He sent his car. Hope you don't mind. - No. - Where are we going? - To Granttine. - I just have to make a quick phone call. - No problem. Alan, I'm going to... have to cancel my hair appointment for tomorrow. Sorry. OK. Ethan. Wow! - My class would love a field trip here. - Hello, Clair. - You look stunning. - Thank you. - You make Anzanol here, right? - We do. On the other side of that wall. No class tours. Sorry. So our dinner date is what, in the employee cafeteria? No, I'm having a few guests. A party. It'll be fun. Great. So do we set the table? Make the hors d'oeuvres? I was driven through the Bluelands to get here. Show me something. Sure. Let's go up there. Am I being too pushy? I've been accused of that. I like pushy. Good. Any calamities? Mueller on some paperwork. A security clearance. Clair Gautier? The Ethan Grant wall of shame. When you make what the world wants, they all have an opinion. I love that one. God, you smell good. Come here. What are you doing? Ethan! No! Ethan! - Miss Gautier, you surprise me. - I don't even know you. - Not yet. Come here! - Ethan. I'm not someone you can just add to your portfolio. You're a romantic. I can do that. I am not the kind of woman that I imagine you're used to being with. I don't just... I'm sorry. Can we forget this? I guess. Good. Maybe I'll have a chance to change your opinion of me. We set up an alias to catch the Anzanol bandits. - And you didn't tell me? - I'm telling you now. (Ruth) 'Alan, I'm going to... What the hell's that? - 'Alan, I'm going to... ' - "I'm going to." She stopped, she changed her message. 'Alan, I'm going to... have to cancel my hair appointment... ' I lost my best friend when she died. Most sons couldn't say that about their mother. I imagine. You're very private. I understand. How could you possibly understand? Nobody can. All of this crap, everybody thinking they're unique. I know I am. How? You can tell me. You're close. You are so close. You don't know how close you are. I nicknamed this one... Judas. Crossovers. Tonight's entertainment. When I pluck out their implant they're really quite intriguing. This one's a RADpunk thief. She stole Anzanol meant for others. - Isn't that correct, Logocki? - Yes, Doctor. This is all sensitive stuff, Clair. Citizens don't really care about Infecteds but they get squeamish when it comes to their actual execution. Oh, you... you look drained. But you're gonna stay? Good. Are you a gambler? It's Yann, is Security showing anything for Dr Grant's schedule? Private party? Where? Granttine? OK, thank you. Granttine's hacking Rcon's files. (Beeping) What the hell's going on here? So, Clair, where did you begin your life's journey? Middle? Bottom? - Er, Low. My mom was nuts. - (Electronic voice) 'Welcome, Dr Grant.' If one starts low and makes it to the top, who can fault that achievement? Good catch. You lose something... Ruth? What I haven't learned yet is who's behind you, it's the only thing keeping you alive. That and the fact that I am gonna screw you. - How long have you known? - Where did you start, Ruth? Crossover husband, Jack Hennessey. My production manager. Rcon records say you were pregnant. Did you have his baby? - Yes. - Oh, so that's it. That is it. You think that I can save it. Him. Her. Travis. Yes, I think you can. I can't save him, Ruth. Only you can do that. And this is how you do it. You and this chair. Only you don't get out alive. Clean mother, Infected baby, mother makes the ultimate donation. The brainstem. Better than marrow, better than a kidney. It cures. - All right. - All right? You crazy? I can't do that. Little Travis would be an orphan. Little Travis would give it away - my secret. I was Infected. Now, you're the only one who knows. It doesn't matter, Ethan. Mademoiselle Gautier, my mother's donation... She didn't have a choice. No, no. God, I'd screw you now but we have guests. Looking for your purse? Your gun's gone. You're very sloppy, Ruth. You're a beautiful... dumb... girl. I need all the names of the people who helped you to get in here. Besides Detective Yann. I already discovered him. - It's just him. That's it. - Oh, yeah. Oh! (Gasping) I knew you'd lie. Shh. Shh. Ladies and gentlemen, the competitors for this evening's Finishing. On one, a RADpunk bandit estimated at 18 years. On two, Citizone Crossover. Closer inspection may be had in the viewing area. Nobody will help you here. Nobody. Nice to have you here, Miss Gautier. That's it. (lona grunting) Could I offer you a drink? Wine, white. He knows about me. Choose a finisher? - God. - Believe me, He's not here. All turn to the centre ring! - You know her. - No. The truck bandit. Well, when we get her implant out we'll see if it's the same model as your dear, beloved husband's. - Why are you doing this? - Because I can. Because I hate myself. - But I hate them more. - (Horn) All betting is now closed. What great spirit. - Please don't, she's my friend. - And disappoint my friends? Go ahead. All here gather to witness the wages of deception. Infecteds, reveal your true nature to the assembled good Citizens. - Finishing begins. - (Horn) You hit me? You're gonna die and your friend's gonna die. - Go! - Rcon! Rcon! Stay where you are! (Mayhem and shouting) - Hurry up. - You OK? (Machine gunfire) (Gasping) Gr-Grant's room. Thanks. I pull this out and you're dead. Ruth! I'll kill him, I swear I will! (Officer) Rcon raid, go! Down the west hall, now! (Shouted instructions continue) - (Gasping) It won't work. - Yeah, yeah. Detective Yann knows. He knows you were an Infected. I can keep you from the cure. I'm gonna do this. You can make it count. (Beeps) Over there! Ruth! Are you in there?! (lona) Ruth! Let us in! Open the door! Come on! Open the door! (Banging on door) - Open the door! - Come on out, the place is secure! Stand back. Back, back. Give me your gun! OK, move back! - Don't. - What is this? - It's OK. - What's going on? It's OK. - Will you take care of Travis? - Oh, Ruth, please, wait. - There's gotta be... - Will you raise Travis? (Whirring) (Crunching, squelching) (lona) Ruth. Ruth. (Sobbing) (TV) 'Researchers announced another breakthrough with slow-decay Anzanol. 'A key factor in the discovery were new blood templates 'from the body of the world's only cured RAD, Travis Hennessey. - 'New Anzanol will be available for free.' - Here you go. - Thank you. Let's go, Travis. - Keep fadin'. There we go, Blanche. Your alternator's shot. But you know what? Here's my card. - You're a mechanic? - Yes, sir. - Bring it by, I'll look at it. - I will. Thanks. - Take care. Have a good day. Got it? - Yeah. - Hey, Pop. - Right there, pal. - We gonna get carry-out? - Sure. Chinese? - Seatbelt. - Aw, it's just a few blocks. Seatbelt. You're the one the world's been waiting for. - You always say that. - I do? (lona) 'How do you measure the future? 'What price does it come at? 'Some of us know. 'Some simply live it.' English SDH PAL
