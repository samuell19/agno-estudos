THE COACHMAN Get him! Get that thief! Get him! Thief! Get that thief! - Watch where you're going! - Thief! Thief! Dirty thief! You're here. Do as I say, and you'll live like a politician's daughter. From tomorrow, we do everything together, okay? But I look so shabby...I can't. There's nothing you can't fix for larger gain, right? There's so much you need to learn. Be at my place by 10am, tomorrow. Why take people scorning you for being a horse keeper's daughter? Mija! Don't tell my father and brother about this, okay? Okay. One sweet potato, please! You always want sweet potatoes! Why shouldn't I be persistent? For the past 5-6 years I've wasted my time as your mistress, but what have you done for me? I can't sell my horses! Oh, just do as I say. - Madame! - What is it? The horse keepers want to settle the account. Tell them to wait! Let me enjoy my drink... Okay. She wants you to wait... I guess Mr. Hwang's here. - Soowon. - Yes? - How old are you? - What? Why do you ask? I'm 37! Ha! Old enough! She's too old to be a housemaid. I've been told she's a widow. Are you playing detective? What's with all the questions? A pretty face like that, shouldn't be working so hard. Hey, where are you going? I'm getting some water. Oh, look at you, I have some here. Lend me a calabash. Here's your water! - Isn't this liquor? - Shh, drink up. - Soowon! - Yes. Mr. Hwang's leaving. Bring his shoes. What are you doing over there? Chunsam! - Hurry. He's in a hurry... - Yes, ma'am. That water tastes great. Can't you tie a shoelace? Concentrate, woman! - You've been distracted lately. - Brush the dust off his shoes! Yes ma'am. Ask for some liquor money. Have a safe trip. Good day, sir. - So, the money's good these days? - Yes, thanks to you. - Good. - Good bye, sir. - How about some liquor money, sir? - Just enough for 2-3 drinks. What, liquor money? You think I'm your bank? Hurry! All together we've earned a total of 6,800 won. I only made 800. Business has been bad lately. What's going on? We've managed only 3-4 rounds today. The cars are stealing our business. If things keep up like this, we're in deep trouble. I'll have to sell the horses. I'm sorry... - Let's go. - Choonsam, let's go to... Hey, come on... Go! Welcome. - Where's Okhee? - She quit today. She quit? What for? She followed her friend, Mija. Will it be coffee? Why do you always get beaten up? Can't you fight back? Why do you always get into fights? Go inside, Sis! Hurry! - Okhee, get dinner ready. - Okay. If you're going to keep this up, then quit school! - You should have let him get beaten up. - Go inside! Stupid son-of-a-bitch! Dad, I'll scold him, so go have your dinner. - Bring in the horse. - Okay. - Okhee, get dinner ready! - Okay. Why do you look so glum? Did they forget your wages? I quit today. What, quit? Did you mess up? Good! Stay home and tend to the housework! - Okhee, - Bring Sis her dinner. - Okay. - Did you feed the horse? - Yes. Eat your dinner. Okhee's quit the cafe. You think she's met some guy? If she has, she's in big trouble! The cafe's new owner has a bad temper. This rice tastes great! This can't be Okhee's work. In fact, Sis came and cooked it. What, Okrae came home? Was she kicked out again? No! Dad, don't be mad with Sis. It's not her fault. It breaks my heart to be angry with her. Her husband's gone mad. He's fallen for a barmaid. - Is that so? - Yes. Don't even mention his name! Tomorrow, I'm going to whip him! Oh my back. It's okay. Don't bother. Eat your dinner, eat! Dad, from tomorrow, I'll pull the horse. Nonsense, I won't allow it! Your exam's right around the corner. Do your best this time. Please don't mention it to anyone, okay? You're my pride and joy. Why wouldn't I want to? If you fail this time, there's always next year. I'll do my best, Dad. If only you passed, I could die right this moment. I trust the fortune teller's predictions. Of my fate? Oh, Dad... What's going on? Are you going to pay me back or just run with it? Why would I run? Business is slow. I'm sorry I missed our meeting last night. You've got to tell me whether the money's coming in or not. I need a straight answer! Are you toying with me? Just wait a few more days. Give me a chance. You've got some nerve! So I'll have to wait until your son passes the national exam? You owe me over 40,000. - Including interest, 40,000! - Oh, you're here. - So, you're here to play lawyer again? - I'm sorry sir. Don't be. It's your father who should be sorry. Please, just a few more days, as Dad says. I've been waiting all this time! Don't start so early in the morning. Go on. What! So, I've ruined your morning! I've waited 9 months! Your son's studies aren't everything! It's not that I don't understand. I don't want to brag, but my son, earns 5,000 hwan each day! Sooner or later I'll get a job, so don't be so angry. You think I can help it? You'll never make it. Passing the exam won't give you the world. Even three years of fighting the Japanese will give you 2-3 pieces of weaponry. You think you'll ever become a man of law? Don't even think about it. Before you leave, pay what you owe me. - And stop making me look bad... - Good bye. Oh, something's been spilled! When did she come? That wench's always coming here after being kicked out! What's the problem? Dad, don't be mad. I'll never know unless she says something! She has to tell me what the problem is! Why are you here? The bastard! You don't deserve being smacked around for being a mute! Let's go! Dad, I'll go see him. No, I'm going to put an end to this. Let's go! Open up! Open up! Changduk! Open the door! - Who is it? - It's me! Go into the kitchen... Why did you lock the door? It's you, father. - Are you angry with me, father? - Don't call me father! Why have you kicked my poor mute daughter out? I never kicked her out. - Please put yourself in my position. - Did you say position? You knew she was a mute when you married her, right? Answer me! Has the devil gotten your tongue? It's your luck to be able to woo dozens of women, but if you can't be decent, you're no worse than a beast! People may look down on her for being a mute and a horse keeper's daughter, but to me, she's my precious child. Wasn't it you who killed your only child? What wench have you fallen for this time? Is this how you pay me back for saving you during the war? If you continue to beat her and kick her out, where could she go? Where? Bastard! Are you going to continue this madness? Or live up to yourself as a man! You moron, this is your home for good. This is where you live and die. It's your home. Don't take it out on her! He's the bad guy! He beats her day and night. I apologize for making such a commotion. Poor thing. Okhee, where are you going? I stopped by the cafe. They told me you quit. - Did something happen? - Don't ask! Okay. Three months and you're already bored of your job... - Where's your brother? - He's pulling the horse. Pulling the horse? His exam's coming up. He has to study... What's the use? He's already failed 3 times. Okhee... You need to find another job, not lounge around like this. In fact, I'm going out for a job interview. If you're interested, I can get you a job at the factory. My friend's going to introduce me to a couple of jobs. Okhee, what's going on? Are you going to settle things? Just wait for 2-3 more days. You keep on saying that. What am I supposed to do? - I'll pay you back, so don't worry. - Goodness... My brother will be back soon, so please look after our house. Are you going out again? Okhee, I'll give you a ride. But that thing's embarrassing! Hey, Soo-up! Why did you take out the horse? You can't do that without my permission. What happened? The horse was frightened by a passing car. Moron! You think anyone can do my job? Do as you're told, and study! - Go and study. - Okay. Leave it, leave it! This will fit you. Put it on. Wow, it looks great. How come everything fits you to perfection? I guess it's a good sign? It's true that clothes make the person. You look great. - Really? - Of course! Hold this and walk for me. How? What men look at the most are a woman's chest and hips. So, slightly spread your chest, hips out a bit.. And sway from side to side! Watch how I do it. Like this, okay? No problem! Now walk! And push out your chest! - I feel like I'll fall. My hee... - Be careful! When you walk, place your weight on your toes and slightly raise your heels. Now try it. - Like this? - Try to be a bit more natural. Like this... Good? The perfume's so strong. If we're to stop by the beauty salon, we need to rush. - Smells good, right? - Great. Do men smell as good? - They smell a bit bitter than this! - Bitter? - Put these on. - Gloves too? Now, match your walk with me. - May I take your order? - A little later. - What if he doesn't show up? - He's coming. I feel like everyone's staring at me. It's because you give a good impression. You look so different with your hair like that. - Really? - Of course! Okhee...In front of men, you need to look like you own the world. Okay? They're here! Over here! I'm sorry we're late. It's okay. Okee, say hello. Mr. Kim, I'll introduce you. This is Ha Okhee, my best friend. She majored in Home Economics at S Univ. Her father runs a large business at the Namdaemun market. I see. I am Kim Byungkook. How do you do? I am Lee Gapduk. How do you do? Mr. Kim's a K Univ. graduate, and a sportsman. His father runs Tongyang Corp. where he's exec. director. I guess I manage to put food on my table. Miss Ha, you give a nice first impression. - She was popular in school. - It's an honor. - Miss Ha! - Yes? You look like you're uncomfortable. May I take your order? What would you like? - We'll have tea. - We'll have coffee! How is your father's business? Good! He's quite busy these days. - What does your brother do? - He works for an airline company. - What about your sister? - She's married. - What's your hobby? - My hobby? Are you blind? Drive! Soowon, your face tells me you bring good luck to others. Are you serious? Of course I am. Look at me. Do I look like a liar? Make some time for me tomorrow, okay? What for? I am taking the day off tomorrow, just for you! You've never been to a movie theater, have you? Theater? It's been so long since I've been to one. I knew it! Finish breakfast early and meet me here tomorrow, okay? I have to get permission from the mistress. Don't tell her that you're seeing me, okay? Oh, I forgot. This isn't much but buy some face cream, and take a bath before you meet me! Where did you get this money? - Watch where you put your hands! - It's broken! What are we going to do? - Don't worry. - Why did you break the bowl! For my sake, calm down. - Darn! - I'll pay for the dish. - Look at you! - Don't worry. I can go home and change! - Don't worry! - I'm sorry! - Those look delicious. - Welcome. Those rice cakes look good. Let's have a taste. - Buy some. - Okay. Delicious! Give me 300 hwan's worth. The middle, give me the middle part. - Welcome. - Is the mistress away? She went to see a movie, so she's not home. Thank god. Business has been awful today. How come? Did something happen? No, it's nothing. Soowon...I have something for you. Something for me? What? Let's go inside. Soowon, you like rice cakes, right? Here! Where did you get them? - Was there a special ceremony? - Not at all. I know you like rice cakes, so I bought them on the street. I often eat them. So, you should give them to your children. But I bought them for you! There's no need. I know you have a good heart. Soowon... I need to get some water. Oh, get up! I'm always imposing on you... From now on don't drink from the faucet. Just ask for water. I just did it for fun. Now have a snack. - Isn't this a chicken leg? - Someone brought it. Go inside, and have some dinner! But the mistress will be furious if she finds out! It'll take her a while. So come inside. - Sit over there. - Okay. - But it's the master's table... - Don't worry. - Can you spare some time tomorrow? - Is something up? Ever since coming to Seoul, I've never been to a movie theater. I guess it's been five years for me. I told the mistress I'm visiting my aunt in Chongnyangni. If that's what you want, sure! The mistress keeps complaining that business is bad, she'll sell the horses, quit everything... So take this, and give it to her later. That Choonsam's already here. - Now, eat up. - Okay. Soowon! We're here, open up! Your friends are here. - Open the door! - Damn it! I'm coming! - Hurry and hide over there. - Open up! I'm coming! Hurry up! - Why did you lock the gate? - Come in. - Is the mistress home? - She went to see a movie... Where's Choonsam? He's not here yet. Didn't you see him? His horse is standing in front of the gate. Where could he be? I guess he's at the bar down the lane. - Then let's get a drink, too. - Yeah, let's go. Have a good time. - Wait, I need to go to the toilet. - The toilet's under repair today. You can use the one at the bar. Let's go. That would be better. - I'll be first to be back, okay? - Okay. Oh brother! Soo-up! Stand straight! Soo-up! Come and look at this. Hey, wake up! Why do you always get beat up? What happened? Did you get into a fight again? Go inside! - Hey! What did you do to yourself? - What? - It's none of your business. - How dare you? Don't interfere with my life! Go inside! Lie down. Get a grip on yourself! Okhee, come in here! Kim Byungkook? - Who is he? - He's my boyfriend. Boyfriend? - Did he buy all this for you? - Of course. You need to know that your head's as empty as this purse. Are you already using your looks to get things? It's better than being despised as a coachman's daughter. Is that so tragic for you? Think of Dad who single-handedly brought us up without Mom! It's our fault that we've been born poor. What? - Why did you slap me! - I'm putting some sense into you! People despise you because you never work hard for anything! You think the exam's so important? You've already failed 3 times! - You're home, Dad? - Yeah. - It was a good day. - You're late. Hey, is Daeup home? He fell asleep after playing soccer all day. He's fast asleep. Go feed the horse. He's a good boy... - Is Okhee home? - Yes. Come inside. Is she asleep already? Hey! Leave her be. She seems to have a headache. A headache? Dad... - You must be hungry. - Me? Not really. A couple of drinks have put you in good spirits. - Do I look happy? - Yes. It was a good day. Have some rice cakes. Wake up Daeup. Were you at some special ceremony? - Of course not... - Then where did you get them? The housemaid at the horse owner's gave them for you. Now eat! Really? She's such a nice lady. She thinks the world of me. By the way, yesterday you said you had to buy a book? Here! But business must've been bad. Did you borrow money again? Of course I didn't. I told you it was a good day. Did that lady give this money to you as well? No... I played a few games with the guys. I had a winning streak. You did? Now go and study! Okay. You must be tired. Get some sleep, Dad. Okay. Now go study. Oh boy! Hurry and bring my dinner! Damn... In two weeks, money comes in. We can move then. If that's what you want, it's not a problem. Now eat. - But I don't have a spoon. - Hey, you go get one! - The stupid wench... - She's such a moron! Now eat. Shit! Can't you just drop dead? Damn! Are you thirsty, Dad? Do you want me to get you some water? Don't worry. I knocked something over while drinking water. - Go sleep! - Okay. Why does he have such sharp ears? Damn, it's burnt! Doesn't he sleep? Dad, did you burn your trousers? Were you watching? Has it started already? Please take off your hat! Strange... I shouldn't have given her that money. I enjoyed the film. We missed the first part. Eat. Miss Ha, there's a lot of people here today... Yes, I guess it's because it's . You must be starving. Let's grab some lunch. - Let's finish the movie. - But we've seen the movie. Go. Damn, is this the only theater in town? Please take off your hat. I'm sorry we missed the first part. We can come again. Why did I have to meet that brat there? - Promise we'll go again. - Of course. - Customer! - Okay! Welcome! What's wrong? Damn, is this the only hot soup diner in town? Did someone you know come in? - May I take your order? - Hot beef soup? - Yeah, hot beef soup. - Yes sir! Two hot beef soups! - Let's go. - What? We're in the wrong diner. - Is that your son? - That punk! Hey! Give it to me! Give it! Give it to me! Stupid wench! Give it! Give it here! Give it! Give it to me! Did you bite me? Give it to me! How dare you run! Bitch! Dad! Your hat. - Your exam starts today, right? - Yes. You're confident, aren't you? I had a good dream last night. Keep it to yourself, Dad. Don't let me lose face this time. Have you been kicked out again? You stupid wench! I'd rather die than be kicked around like that! - Please calm down! - Die! Calm down, Dad! What did I do to deserve this? Oh, you wench. Dad, stop it! Why isn't the grim reaper here to claim your soul? Stop it Dad. It's not her fault! Stop... What did I do to deserve this? I can't take it anymore. Each time I'm about to forget, she comes back. Will that bastard keep pushing her around? Sis... Don't cry. I have a date, so lend it to me for just one day, okay? Okhee? When can I meet your brother? - He left for Hong Kong yesterday. - Okhee! Hong Kong? Why didn't you say so! - I found out after he left. - I see! Okhee! - Excuse me for a moment. - Okay. You look so different all dressed up like that! Has your brother gone to take the exam? I don't care whether he takes his exam or not! - What do you want? - I was going to have lunch with you! I already had lunch with that client. How long have you known him? Long enough! He promised to get me a job at a trade company. Okhee, don't trust him. Don't waste your time on a fraud like him. That's enough! Are you being jealous? Hey, Okhee. Listen to me. Do you know what guys like that will do to you? They promised to hire you at the factory. Start tomorrow. - Okhee! - Yes! - Don't you feel sorry for your poor Dad? - I don't want to hear anymore! Okhee! Who's that man? - The company chauffeur. - I see. Get in the car. - Dad! - Oh, it's you. - How was the exam? - We'll see. What, we'll see? It's getting chilly, I'll run the horse from now on! shut up! You'll just be dropping things like last time! - Soo-up. - Yes? - Here, go have a bowl of noodles. - No. - Don't be late. - Okay. - Don't be late, Dad. - Okay. Hello. Don't have me fooled again. - What? What do you mean? - It's nothing. - Mr. Ha! Mr. Ha! - Soowon. - Are you on your way home? - Yes. Why did you buy so much! Your son's exam is today, right? Yes, but...we'll be sure when he finally passes. This morning I prayed to the gods for him to pass. Take this, and make some hot soup for your son. You're always so kind to me. Then just one. Just one. Good. I guess I've been fooling myself. - Go now. Go. - Yes. - Take care. - Okay. Hey, Soowon! Soowon, wait for me! Soowon! Hey! What do you think of me? - Let go of me! - Don't I deserve a fish? Let go of me, I'm busy! Hey, so I've given you money for nothing? Why did you trick me? - I said, I'm busy! - Soowon! You took me as a fool! I'll get you! You fiend, Choonsam! Soo-up! You're home, sir. What brings you here? Soo-up took his exam. I wanted to know how he did. You're a good friend to him. No, in fact... You came to see Okhee, right? - Where's Soo-up? - The public bathhouse. Yeah? Were you tending the house? - Let's go inside. - Sir! You have the best manners in your family. Mr. Ha! Mr. Ha! Daeup's big sister's drowned in the Han river! What, Okrae? Yes, she died as soon as she hit the water. Are you serious! Let's go in my truck! Hurry! Here come the victim's family. What's her father's name? Ha Choonsam. Take the body home. Okrae! Open your eyes and look at me! Look at your Dad! How could you die! You could never call me Dad! You could never call your siblings by their names! I may have brought you out into this world, but I've been so wrong about you! I killed you. Forgive me! For the past 30 years, you've been scorned for being a mute. And now you're gone. You yearned to live with me, but I couldn't accept it. It wasn't because I didn't love you! - Dad, calm down. Dad! - Mr. Ha, look at this. Her frozen hands washed this laundry. She never finished! Poor wench. How could she leave like this? Sis, Sis... Stop it. It's no use thinking of the poor thing! So, just calm down. All applications closed! It's been three months since sadness hit our household. To repay my father for all his support, I've tried seeking a job, only to be discouraged by harsh reality. I'm doubtful of the results of this exam, and for this, I am terribly embarrassed to face my father. Yong! yong! What the...Damn! What have you done, Choonsam! Where did you leave your senses! Look at the car. See what you've done to the license plate! I'm so sorry. Mr. Hwang... I'll see to it that you never run that horse again! Ah it really hurts... Dad, let's go to the hospital early in the morning. No need for that. It costs money to go to the hospital. We don't have that money. I'll go see Mr. Hwang! He's the one who hit you. He has some nerve to scold you rather than pay for your injuries. Stop it. Stop. It's true that his horse puts meals on our table. Forget about it. Anyone home? - I'm from the horse owner's place. - I see. I came to see your father... - He's resting. - I see. But do come in. - Who is it? - You have a guest. Who is it? - Dad! - Soowon, What brings you here so early in the morning? How are you doing? I heard the news this morning... - Soo-up... - Yes? Say hello. This is Soowon whom I've been talking about. - No need for that... - I heard so much about you. - How do you do? - Hello. - Where's Okhee? - I think she went to the market. I made these pants for your father. But I'm terrible at sewing. Put them away. Thank you so much. - This too. Serve some for him. - Of course. Why did you bring so much? Don't say that. I have some bad news. Did something happen? This morning, Mr. Hwang made a big fuss about selling the horse. - My horse? - I guess so. Dad, you shouldn't take this! After all, he's the one who made you like this... - I'll go see him. - You stay put! Dad, we didn't do anything wrong. The truth has to be told! Soo-up! Is he really going to sell the horse? Don't worry too much. It's because you're not well. I'll go with him. Soowon, I'm so sorry. Don't worry about me. Get some rest. Madam, I'm back. - You have a guest. - Who can it be? If it's for me, tell them I'm not home! How do you do? What brings you here? Oh, you must've heard from Soowon. I heard you were going to sell the horse. From now on I'll pull the horse. The job's not for anyone! You'll trip over the horse's hooves. I'm a horse keeper's son, why wouldn't I manage? You're selling the horse because my father's ill, right? It's my horse. How dare you come here to confront me... I'm not here to confront you. If you sell the horse now, it'll be unfair to my father. Unfair? It's his fault he wrecked my car. He's the one who should be sorry. Madam, my father has no fault. The accident was caused by Mr.Hwang's car. What? The accident was caused by Mr.Hwang's car? Yes, it's true. All those law studies have put words in your mouth. What, the car caused the accident? Sir, I'll pull the horse until my father gets better. Please don't sell the horse. So, our future man of law's going to pull the horse? That should be in the news. It doesn't take law studies to pull a horse. You think taking the exam makes you better than us? That's so unfair. The powerful helping the helpless, isn't that social justice? No medical compensation is one thing, but selling the horse, that's too much. You're just a horse keeper's son. How dare you make a commotion at this time in the morning! I'm selling the horse, and that's final! This discussion's over! I had a bad dream last night. I should've seen this coming! How dare you treat your elders like this? What's going on? Why are you taking the horse? It's in exchange for your father's debt. It's been settled with your father. If you can bring the money today, then it's yours. - Changsoo! - Hey, what brings you here? I have some urgent matter to discuss with you. Urgent matter? Your father has taken our horse in exchange for our debt. He did? But he would never do that. I won't explain. I'll promise I'll pay you back. Just lend me some fast cash. If it's true, then my father's done wrong. I'll give you the money. Keep it a secret from my father, and get your horse back. - I'm so grateful. - Let's go in my truck. - Hey, hey! - Stop, let go of me. You think I'm for free? I don't think so. If you won't marry me, I'll kill myself! How dare you threaten me! You fraud, bully! I won't let you get away with this! Fraud? A horse keeper's daughter should play in her own league. Your father owns a big business? Your brother works for an airline company? He went to Hong Kong? Take this off! You dirty bitch! What do you want? Oh, the chauffeur. Aren't you being too harsh on a weak lady? Why do you care? I mean, don't make things worse, okay? No need for violence. You talk too much! Bastard! Okhee... Didn't I tell you last time? That he's no good... I'm sorry. I'm so angry... Don't be. Wipe your tears. Let's take you to the hospital. Is there a Ha Choonsam here? Yes, I am Ha Choonsam. Did my son do anything wrong? Yes, last night this student stole a woman's purse. However it seems that he didn't do it on purpose. So, this time I'll let him off the hook. I hope you will teach him never to do this again. Okay? Sir, I'm so sorry. Okay. And you! Don't forget your promise to me. - Good day. - It'll never happen again. Have a good day. I never sent you to school to become a thief, did I? But I didn't steal, Dad. Okhee's run off with a man, and now you! You may as well join your mother! My dear wife, I can't believe our son's like this. I feel helpless. I never did anything wrong, just pulled the horse. Why is he breaking my heart? If you can't be a decent human being, then let's just die in front of your mother's grave! You little brat! I'd rather starve than steal! Be a man! Not a thief! I'll be a man, father... Did something happen to upset you? It's nothing. My son was not behaving. How are you doing these days? Thanks to you, I'm feeling better. Don't move too much. The horse owner must be furious... She wants the horse returned by tonight. I'm planning to quit my job tonight. - You're quitting for good? - Yes. Mr. Kim seems to have told Mr.Hwang about us. Things are not the same anymore. But if you quit, where are you going to go? My brother asked me to live with him. So, I might go back to my hometown. That's a good idea. After I killed Okrae, I cannot face my children anymore. I understand. I'm sorry but you need to return the horse before its owner comes home,ok? I will. If your son passes the exam, it'll be the end of your hardships. Take good care of yourself. I'll be going... Soo-up! Oh, hello there! Thanks to you, I'm starting work today. You'll need to help your Dad until you get the exam results. Oh, I met Okhee last night. Okhee? Really? She didn't come home, last night. I helped her cut her ties with some bastards. She was too embarrassed to come home. So from today, she'll be working at the factory. Really? Thank you so much for doing that. My Dad will be thrilled to hear that. The medicine's well done today. Will there be a buyer if the horse comes back? I'll need to ask around. Why? For some time, my brother's been asking me about finding a horse available for sale. Really? Then he can buy this one. I'll give you a good price. Okay, then I'll let him know. Can you put cash up front? I have my savings and I own some land. Oh that's right. Good. When the horse comes tonight, you can tell your brother. Then I'll take the horse. What brings you here Choonsam? Your leg's still bad... - I'm holding up. - Hey! What's up? Are you okay with that leg? - Are you going somewhere? - Yeah. I'm taking the horse to its owner! She's waiting with an angry face. Don't worry too much. I'll let you know if there's another horse. - Go on. - Take care of yourself. He's in big trouble! - Are you okay? - How's the leg? - See you around. - Don't worry Choonsam. Come by sometime. Just take care of that leg. Don't tell him I bought it. - He'll get mad.. - Don't worry. This ends our business. No need to come here anymore. And teach your children some manners! They should know how to treat their elders! My apologies... Starving will teach you how gracious I was to you! Now go! Bye, Yong... Forget about it, Dad. More liquor here. I was way over my head when I thought I could pass the exam. I'll start with anything from tomorrow. Don't be foolish. You, earning money? Don't worry! Tomorrow, I'll look for another horse. Don't feel bad about Yong. Just stay home from now on. Soo-up, let me tell you a story. When I was thirteen, I journeyed with your grandfather to the foreign plains of Manchuria, penniless. With the Japanese police on our tails, and on an empty stomach, we paved through the heavy snow. Finally your grandfather got himself a carriage. Despite the meager daily earnings, he wanted me to get an education. So he sent me to school everyday. But I wanted to earn money rather than study. My father slapped me senseless. And screamed at the top of his lungs. In less than a year, he passed away leaving me his carriage. After I buried him underneath a bridge, I remember beginning to sob with fear. I didn't know how I would live. Your father's lost his chance for an education. There's a time for studying. I'll support you to the end, so just pass the exam. - I'll do my best, Dad. - Good. This isn't good for you. Let's go. Okay, let's go! Come here. - You're late. - Hello. I haven't seen Okhee for a while, did she go somewhere? That wench? Don't worry too much about her. Changsoo's got her a job at the factory. - Changsoo? - Yes. Now go inside. Let's go. - Soo-up. - Yes? Go visit Okhee at the factory, tomorrow morning. Soo-up... What's going on? Dad, you think he escaped here? Oh my precious Yong! Did run away 'cause you missed me? Now eat. Dad, a stranger tied the horse here and left. A stranger? He didn't say who he was? He told me to use the horse well without telling anyone. Without telling anyone? Have I a secret benefactor? I'm glad you're back. Yong, I'm never letting you go again. - Soo-up! How are you holding up? - I'm okay. Hey! Look here! Hello. What's going on? This horse was supposed to go to Soowon's brother's. Excuse me? I see. So, he's gotten to Soowon. A coachman... They deserve each other! Madame Soowon? - Can I have some water to wash my face? - Okay. Dad, the car's here. When do the exam results come out? - At 2pm. - Did you have a good dream? Then meet me in front of the company at 2pm. - Have a nice day. - Yes. Excuse me... Where are the exam results posted? In front of Capitol Hall. Why do you ask? No, it's nothing. - Thank you. - Yes. Thank you. - Welcome. - Working hard? I made this myself. Please give it to Dad. Wow, presents already? I've come with Daeup. - Daeup! - Sis! - Are you coming from school? - Summer vacation's started yesterday. - Let's go see Soo-up's exam results. - Okay. Changsoo, join us to see Soo-up's exam results. I wish I could, but I have to take the truck in for repair. - I'll stop by your house in the evening. - Okay. - Wait. - Okay. Look! Gil Changdeuk, passed! Ha Soo-up Soo-up! Did you pass? Dad! Yes, you've passed! - Dad. - You've passed! - Dad... - Good job. Let's go. Dad, get up. Let's go. Madame Soowon's here. - Ma'am, what brings you here? - Nice to see you. Thank you so much. How did you know...? I was actually planning to go visit you at your brother's. I've been looking forward to this day too. Thank you. I owe it all to you. Don't mention it... Now you've really succeeded. - Soo-up! - Soo-up! Soo-up! Thanks for coming, Okhee! - You came, ma'am? - Thanks, Daeup... Where's Changsoo? - He had to go to the mechanic's to repair his truck. - I see. Dad... Ma'am, can you be our mother from now on? - Okhee, let's go. - Okay. Let's go.
