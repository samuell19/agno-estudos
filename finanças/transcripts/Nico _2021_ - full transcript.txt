Hello! Excuse me! I have to pass! Hello!! Fuck off, you stupid cunt! Fuck off! I'm good, my love. Let's practice. I'll show you the steps. I've been practicing and I noticed.. First- one, one, two, three. One, one, two, three. How are you? Very well, my sweetheart. You want to check my blood pressure? Exactly, we'll check it now. And there were no doughnuts today. All sold out. Ok. You shouldn't eat so much chocolate cream! But I love sweets. Yeah, but such a big glass.. Ok, I'll try my best. Ok? I want to make it to 99, you know? Since when are you 99? 99 is a lucky number. Brigitte, what's this? I was looking out the window again. All black? -Yes! Here, aswell. Lean on a pillow when you're hanging out the window! Be so kind.. ..and get rid of it! I will. Look, now you have a punk hairdo. Looks great! I've got a song to go with it. Know that song? Master John, Master.. Brother John! Brother John.. Brother John.. I feel reborn. Nice headscarf. Suits you! Doesn´t it? Have you ever had an affair? Yes! Really? Of course! When? A long time ago. Where I had my treatment. What? -Yes. You had a fling at the health resort? -Yes. Brigitte! You old babe, you! It was lovely. What did you do? Well.. ..hung upside down and laughed! Did you have sex? -Yes. You had sex? -Of course. Enjoy it and lips sealed. Every treatment another affair? -Yes, imagine! And I went ten times. What? You had ten flings? Ten affairs! Let's toast to the ten! No, let's toast the last one. Hans! To Hans? To Hans! That's awful! How can she always drink that? The strawberry liqueur was better. Yeah. He has a sars now? It's a 'sars' isn't it? Saz! Saz. What's this for? For the acoustics. Ah, acoustics? Exactly. That way it comes out better. Do you know Volkan? Yes, I know him. He plays E-Saz. Like.. Not as smooth as that. Oh, God! Does that hurt much? You poor thing! Are you still breathing? It doesn't look like it. I did not want that.. Allah! How old are you? She tricked me. Cool! What's in my nose? Take it out, the wax! It's worse when it gets hard. I don't get why people cover up even here. What's your problem? My problem is.. ..I don't get why people cover themselves up even today. What's the point? There are people who want to wear it, let them. Other people don't wear it.. No! We didn't fight for years so that they wear what they want. You fought for years? They're fighting to be respected for wearing it. It's discriminatory against men. As if every man is so horny that he'll jump on any woman without a scarf. I'm too hungover for this. ..immaculate vibrator.. ..immaculate dildo.. ..I don't like saying that, Allah! Did you wash your hands? No! That's disgusting! Come on! Wait! Here. Don't need it. Hey. Hey! Long time no see. All good? It's been ages. You've been away? I was on the road. As always. Alright. New glasses? Recognized! -Suits you! The other ones suited you, too. But these are fancier. Great! Enjoy the sun! Have a good one! Excuse me? What "excuse me"? Let's go! I want to know where that stuff comes from. Right! Ask her.. In Nepal they pick it up naked and scrape it off their bodies. THC is stored in your fat cells, if you don't smoke and exercise.. ..it gets released and makes you high again. Allah Akbar Leave it. Did you just push me? You pushed me! I pushed you?! Yes. You got an anger problem? You'll have an anger problem! What are you staring at? Man! Man, man, man! Come on! Watch it, watch it! Keep calm when she talks to you, okay? What's your deal, huh? Nothing, you fat piece of shit! Take the other path! Fuck off! You heard her, go around! Go around! Are you deaf? Listen to her! Don't touch me! How ugly she is. Like a puppet! Hanging on the ropes? Got nothing to say now? Maaan! Shut up! Stop shouting! Take her backpack! Fell silent? Got some baklava in there? For the way home? Going to cry now? Lost your voice? You little piece of shit! Don't touch my tits, you stupid pig! Get up! Come on ..you maggot! Bitch. Get up! Allah Akbar..! Alahhha Akbar..! Alahhha Akbar..! What's your problem? I’m so glad that you're here. That could have been awful. Stop crying! What.. crying? I'm not crying. This eye can't see very well. You can't see well? It's blurry. It's a bit fuzzy, but it's ok. What about this one? How many? -Two. Now, how many? One. -That you can see! Blurry! I didn't say I was blind. Hop aboard! Another round. I'd like a short haul ticket. Another round. Wait! You're stuck on something. Go up! Guess what!? Brigitte pissed on my hand today, like it was nothing! She's not always sober, is she? How is it when you're with her? She's never sober with me. Something stinks in here. Take the trash out! Have you eaten anything since you got out of there? Everything will be fine. Don't get upset! It'll be ok. Don't cry, it's ok. No worries. It's ok. Hey! Look, Fernandez forgot his pills again. Make sure he always takes them! Ok. And.. ..just before you go, after dinner. Then.. I washed up at Brigitte's.. Are you ok? Yes. Then.. you have to take Sascha out. I couldn't get to it. So.. Fernandez.. his pills before going to sleep or right after eating? No! I just told you! Just after eating, before you go. Take a sip, it'll help you calm down. Shut up! This face here, you've gotta break it. If he attacks you, you only have one chance. One shot! One! That's it! Two! Very good! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! You got it, bravo! Well done! Change feet, other side! Just like that, very good. Focus! Bam! One shot! Don't back off! What's wrong with you? If you do it, do it right! I'm your friend, you don't need to be afraid! Be afraid out there, not here. Roger that! Got it? -Yes.. Louder! -Yes! That's it! That's how you have to be.. ..or you won't make it. Your goal is up here! You're a pretty girl but you look like.. You should be happy they didn't kill you! You have to make it. You won't get beaten up again. Never ever again! That's why you came here. And I'll make sure of it! Ok. One! Two! Three! Again. One! Two! Three! Well done! You can do it. Wait a second! Yes, yes. Your will is important. Look, that's nothing! Arm forward. You get hit here. What if someone hits you with a stick? Your head, you have to block it. Here, block it. Arms up! Turn this way! This is your muscle. He hits you here. Much harder. Good! Arm up! Hold on to your will! Very good! Now this arm, don't worry! Above your head. You got it. Stay with it. Back up, let's go! Hold it! Great! Nine! Great! Ten! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Very good! Six! Great! Seven! Come on! Eight! Slowly, slowly. Push it! Nine! Ten! One! No one will hurt me again. - Again! No one will hurt me again! - Again! No one will hurt me again! You really want it? Yes! Ok. We need to check your blood pressure. Relax your arm! It's good. 136 to 92. Could be better! I can already hear it. Do you hear the fun fair? Come on, let's try! French fries... with mayonnaise. ..cotton candy as an appetizer. Come on, this way. Come on, let's go to the fair! ..a quick round. If you don't like it, we'll leave. I'm with you. When was your last time at a fun fair? When I was twelve, maybe. You have to go every ten years. It's a must! The cans are smaller, we'll have a chance. Hey! Hi! She's cute! The recoil! Seriously? Such a strong kickback. I think I twisted my shoulder! Sorry, Englisch please! The Power... Broken, it's broken, the shoulder. I'm sorry, it's not broken. It's just a bit too hard for her. It's really big power in this and makes... You can take this. Ah, it's like your jacket. Thank you! Do you want to try? No, I'm fine! Actually I have this... My favourite toy. It's called "Jellysh Shrimp Sheldon". It's quite cool, ha? Jelly Shrimp Sheldon? You can get it! Did you give him the name? Maybe you can help me for this? I'm Jelly Shrimp Sheldon, I've got really big eyes! Come on, you can try it. I don't know, maybe this is the technique? Not bad! Actually for this, you need to clear all of this. All down, so you get.. Sorry, but maybe next time. You wanna try again? Yes, I try again. I try it also again. Maybe you can help this one? Yes. Ah, take it! Left. Will you give me a cigarette please, I forgot it at home? Excuse me, you know some place where we can get some Pommes? Pommes? Let's have Pommes! „Fries”! Right, "Fries"! Some good fries? Yeah, come with me! Yeah, I follow. Sorry. -It's okay. These for you. Thanks. Cheers! Nice name, Ronny. Rosa. You want some? No thanks. Really not? Okay. Hey, ah. Have you been to the mirror room? You mean such a room where you... They've got a room of mirrors. Let's go! Her butt is killing me! We could.. Look, I've got one or two gray hair I don't want her to see. No way! I want to try the Sheldon again. Oh yeah, right, here you have what you need. See you later! Need help? Like this! Put the cork in! Look.. Take it up! Wanna fuck? That's enough! You can leave! Fuck off! It's enough! I'm sorry! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Did he touch you? No. She's okay. Fuck this idiot! She's okay, I think. Great move! Yeah, she's okay. I'm sorry! Great move! Your sausage is broken! This guy is really... Not easy to work here? Great move, really. Hey.. I think she's okay. One! Two!

I've been asking myself for years how you're doing. I would be delighted to hear from you. Rosa! She already called three times! Do you need help? Do I look like I do? Shut up! Bitch. Get up! What's wrong? What's going on? What's wrong with you? I called. I've called a hundred times! No one picks up. Just the answering machine. Are you even listening to what I'm saying? Say something! Why are you treating me like that? What have I done.. what have I done? You think we don't stand out in this shitty white world? I don't have time for this! Do you think I have time to call a hundred times.. ..with no answer? I have no time. Don't you understand? You worry when someone's acting like this. You don't.. How did you get like this? -Exactly.

International. We're culti-multeral. Multi-cultural, Brigitte! Multi-cultural? I like swans. Do you? -Yes. They're... Much cooler than people. Why is it? They're faithful to other swans. They're commited. And if a swan dies... ...its partner dies because he's sad. Wow! I didn't know that. Look, Nico. Brigitte likes you. I like you too. Yeah. I live close by, you don't have to bring me to my door. No, it's alright. You know I do karate, I can protect myself. Karate? Yes. There are kumites who do in karate.
