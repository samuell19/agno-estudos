Hey. Shh. Hey. You're all better now. You're safe. What do you think? The black one? Where in the fu... heck is your daddy? Should we go find him? Daddy? Where are you? Now? Hello? - You chose now to do this? - Oh, hey. Gordita. Come to Papa. Even though you shouldn't be here. It's too dusty for you. Daddy's the only one who gets to hide away in this man cave of his. I know. You going somewhere? No, we are going somewhere. Yeah, no. I'm ready. You know what? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I forgot our date night. Forget it. Could you please just not sigh? Really? Okay. You don't honestly expect me to believe that you forgot your own argument about how date night was cheaper than therapy, do you? Right, like you forgot we agreed your mom wasn't allowed in our house anymore. We're broke. I don't see you finding a free babysitter. I would have. What? Don't start this right now, please. Can we just try to have fun? We're out, okay? Let's just try. It's kind of cool to be out after dark, you know? Childless people do this all the time. Gets dark and they go out. All the neon lights. It's like a fucking video game. It's like... like Tron. - Hey. We're so glad you could make it. - Thanks for having us. - Wow. - This place is beautiful. Matteo and Adrienne just bought the house down the street. - But they... - Thank you. Yeah. But they can't move in until, what, next October? Yeah, there's this co-op living community renting it. - It's, like, eight kids in their 20s. - It's, like, ten kids, actually. Mm. I'm sure someone's sleeping in the laundry room. - Ew! - It's kind of fun. Come on. Shared space, you know. Cooking, cleaning. - Life on the porch with a ukulele. - Excuse me. We showed up for inspection with our baby. She was, what, like, seven days old. - Yeah. So little... - We scared them shitless. Married people with babies. Run! We're not married. No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume. No, we just... We've got the house and the baby, and so... Also, like, a new marriage, whatever, it's like... Totally. We wouldn't have done it, honestly, except my family would've killed me. No, you mean me. They would've cut my dick off with a machete. Oh. Ow! And I thought Adrienne's mom hated me. I mean, she does, but more in a "I'm praying to God to curse your eternal soul" kind of way. When she comes to the house, we play this game where we pretend we can't see or hear each other. Very pleasant. Okay, excuse me. Liam? - Hey! - Hey! - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I haven't seen you here in so long. I guess now I know why you wanted to come so badly. I had no idea that he was going to be there, okay? And God forbid I have friends. You certainly have friends, right? You know, we both deserve to be happy. Liam makes you happy? I didn't say that. Are you happy? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Oh, that's convincing. We agreed not to do anything crazy in the first year. We just have to get through the first year. I don't want to just get through it. I want to enjoy it. - You want to control it. - What choice do I have? I'm dragging you through the motions of our life. Your life. You wanted to have a baby, we had a baby. You wanted a house, we bought the house. What now? How about the truth? - Don't. - You can't do it. No, you want me to make up some pretend confession to justify your paranoia, and I won't do that. Yeah, right. You're not gonna be happy till you're miserable. You know, I just... I actually... Honestly, I do not know what the point is. Of life? Of us. Why are we even together anymore? We... We have a newborn baby. We just closed escrow. What? Now what? You want to split up? I want to... All these neon lights... It's like a video game. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You know, we both deserve to be happy. Are you happy? Time of death: 12:34 a.m. Chica! Please don't! Chica! We'll give you a minute. No! Wait. Is there something beyond all this? Is there an afterlife? Today on our show, we'll seek answers to those questions. Our first guest was rushed to the hospital... Ellie. Ellie. Look at Mommy, baby. Ellie. Ellie. - Ellie, look at Mama. - I remember one minute being in this world and the next minute being, like, I died. I miss her so much. Maggie? - I can't believe she's gone. - I know. - That's in my face. - Sorry. I'm quitting. I just can't lose you. Come here. Thank you all for being here. Okay. "To everything there is a season... and a time to every purpose under the heavens... a time to be born... and a time to die." I'm sorry. This feels so unreal. Like a mistake, you know? Like I could reach into the hourglass and stir the sands and just change it all. No, I'm sorry. I... I can't do this. Sorry. Sorry. Poor thing. I'm gonna go check on him. - "Love is patient, love is kind." - Shea! - "It does not envy, it does not boast." - Shea! Let's let the body cool off first, okay? It's better this way. My sweet girl. See all the toys. Yeah! So many pretty toys. See, this is Ellie's room now, and we're gonna do just great. Mm. Aw. Ellie Bellie, you're gonna live with Grandma and Grandpa now. Look at you. - Grandma? - Hmm? Do you really think she loved my dad? Are those my journals? Oh, God, no. Fuck. Don't... Please don't look at those. I think your dad was hard to love. Stop now. It's not your fault your father left. Now, tears won't solve anything. They won't bring him back. Bring him back from where? Where is your dad? Where the shit is your dad? Matteo? Hey! Adrienne! Come down. What are you doing? You can see me. What? I died. - I died, Matteo. - Okay. It's so wrong that that was it. It was just headlights and a half gasp... Stop. Stop. You're confused. We had an accident. Oh, my God, you're dead too. What? No! No, I'm not. And you're not. How do you know? Because I know. Well, because we're here. I mean, spending eternity on the 10 Freeway... What did we do to deserve that? You weren't there with Ellie. Where do you go? What happens to you? You just get scared and then, what, you just... you disappear? You concussed. That's it. No. I'm dead. - I could step into traffic now. It wouldn't matter. - Hey! Hey. It's okay. What is this, like, purgatory? What's happening to me? Just hold on to me. Hmm? We just want what's best for Ellie. We can't leave her here, Steve. If she had just left instructions for what she would've wanted in a situation like this. She would want us to take care of Ellie. What about Matteo? God forgive me, but this is all his fault. He couldn't take care of her. He wouldn't marry her. He couldn't protect her, and now she's... I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves. We should take the baby home. Shit! What? What happened? There was somebody outside. I thought I saw some... Outside? It was me. I was outside. The door was locked. I had to go around the house. Hey. I don't know how much time I have left here, Matteo. Well, none of us do, right? It's part of the mystery. I heard them talking. They're gonna take Ellie. - Who said... - My mother. I just heard them. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of my family, Patty. Thank you very much. As if it was my fault. Hey. We got to get you better, okay? But no one is taking our baby. Okay? Hey. Come. Come, come. It will take a pack of wolves more rabid than your mother to take her away. All right? Do we even have a baby? - What? - The baby was in the car, but the car seat was emp... - Hey. You... - Maybe I just imagined that we have a baby. You... You didn't want to have a baby. We have a baby. Ellie is our baby. She's six months old, kinda cute. Remember when she was born, that she couldn't latch? We were freaking out. And then these researchers from Denmark came. Remember what he said? "We're doing a study on the benefits of..." Of what? Of narrative therapy for new mothers and newborns. You've been through a traumatic experience, but you've been able to process by talking through it. The birth was traumatic for you, but you've been able to talk about it with your husband. Boyfriend. - Sorry? - Nothing. Nothing. Right. But the baby, she has no idea what has happened. She needs to process too. You need to tell her her story. Um, okay. Hey. We had kind of a crazy birth, huh? It was hard, and it was painful... because the cord was wrapped around you and you couldn't breathe. And then all these people rushed in, and it was bright, and it was loud, but those people were helping you. You weren't alone. And we were there the whole time. We were just not breathing with you for those 90 seconds... and then you did. You breathed. And I know you're so tired from all that craziness, but you're all better now. You're safe. But, my baby, you've got to eat. She's on. You see? Remember, we have a baby. I'm gonna help you make sense of everything else. I'm gonna... I'm gonna tell you our story, okay? That way you can know that you're okay. You can know you're safe. What if you're wrong? What if it's a sad story? No. - It's not. - Sorry to wake you. One second, Patty. You need anything? Tell her you're fine, please. I'm not even here. So she's talking to a dead girl? To you. Okay. Okay, so you won't talk to anyone for a bit. Okay? We'll stay here, and we'll figure this out ourselves. I did some laundry, and I was thinking I'd make soup tonight. I have to go to the store, so if you want anything... Thank you, Patty. We're fine. Thank you. Take your time. Okay, let's stay in bed. One step at a time. Hey. Shall we start from the beginning? Of time? Of us. Fine. If it means you'll stay, then fine. I will stay. Close your eyes. - Where are we? What is it? - Okay, this way. - Okay, all right, stop. Stop. Stop. - I don't like it. - I don't want it. - Okay, one, two, three. Surprise! Yeah! Oh, my God, you guys, this is awesome. Hey! What is this? I was so uncomfortable in the spotlight. - Hi! - And I thought that was so cute. All these people are here because they love you so much. Look, and there's so many snacks. I remember you blushed. No, I didn't. - Okay. - What? I didn't. I lured you in with my boyish charm. That's what I did. Oh, yeah, this one. Shia. Sean? Come on. You remember her name. Shea. She was always just so much. She never really talked to me after we got together. She talked to you. I told you nothing happened with Shea. Yeah, you did tell me that. Shea got me a job in a hotel in Palm Springs. All the woodwork and doors. - With her? - Just two months. Hey. I haven't finished with the night we met. You remember what we talked about? - Hmm. Movies? - Aliens. My love of show tunes. Yes, and yet, I kept talking to you. And, oh, The Bluest Eye. You love Toni Morrison. And I wanted to give you a blow job right there. What? No. - No way. - Way. Fuck, I wish I knew. You were focused on me so intently like we were the only ones there. - And you told me about your stepdad. - Not that night. No, you did. About the last time that you saw him. Oh, yeah. I was ten. He had his hands around my mom's neck, so I called the cops, and of course he denied it. Then my mom blamed me when he left. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. What a downer. My parents are a pain, but not painful enough that I can get rid of them. That's too bad. - I mean... - No, I mean, that's good. It's good, I guess. - Anyway... - Cheers. You can spend the night in my room if you promise to, um, not molest me. - No, wait. That was weeks later. - I remember. You asked to crash on my couch. - What time's your meeting in the morning? - It's at 9:00. Thank you for letting me stay. It's just that traffic in the morning, it's crazy heading this way, so... I thought it would be easier. Yeah, no worries. It's fine. You know, I lied about the meeting. There was no meeting. I know. It was almost dawn. I thought you were never gonna kiss me. - Oh! - I tri... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come back. Come back. Come back. Please. Mm. I'm sorry. Make love to me. You got a condom? - Don't you? - No. - What? You light... - Are you serious? I mean, you light a hundred candles, and you have no condom? I thought you'd have one. I'm sorry. No. What kind of feminist are you? Wait. Bam. Thank God we don't use these fucking things anymore. Yeah, because we don't have sex anymore. No, I'm sorry. Shh, shh. Let's... Let's not think about that. Focus. Do you smell smoke? Fire! Fuck! Matteo! Matteo! You just left me there. You just left me there to die. That's not what happened. I came back. I came back and put it out. I saved the day. I was fucking Superman that night. - We laughed about this. - Yeah. Hey. Hey. I love you. No, I was the one that said it first. - Does it matter? - Yes. No. I don't know. There you are. Hey. You scared me. I'm a good ghost. You promised you'd stay with me. I've been doing some research. It's kind of crazy what happens to people after trauma. I mean, what they experience, you know? Makes sense that you feel off. - Off? - Yeah. What do you think happens when you die? - Nothing. - What if it's bad? Painful, some extension or manifestation of your fears and your failings? - Hey. - Of your last moments, again and again and again and again? No. No, no. Uh, wait. It can't just be an insular emotional repetition. I mean, if it's not nothing, it's gotta be something bigger than that, right? We're space dust. Right? So we just go back to that, to be part of everything. - The water, the trees. - "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." If you want to get Catholic about it, yeah. When you die, Adrienne... but you're not dead yet. I think I'm here to get you to step up and take care of Ellie. - We talked about this. - I saw it, and you weren't there. - Hey, stop it. - I saw her, and you weren't there. So maybe you were lying, and that's why I'm stuck here. - I wouldn't lie about that. Wait. - And that's why I'm still here. No. I know you're always the fixer, always in control, but... you gotta trust me on this one. Hmm? When I go, you'll be a good dad. - You're gonna learn to braid hair... - Hey, stop. - ...and sing lullabies. - Okay. - She's gonna need you. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Let's talk about what's real. What really happened. Okay? Mexico. A happy memory. - It's okay. - Don't. It's okay. - I just met your family. - Uh-huh. They loved you. I'm so glad you made us do this trip. Afterwards. You were always glad afterwards. Well, how could I ever imagine it was going to be so... - Magical. - It was. I could see our whole life, just this... beautiful adventure carved out on the horizon. You made me rethink everything I thought I knew about what I wanted. Will they come? Yeah, they're coming. Here! Whoa! Wow! Yay! - Right here! Right here! Right here! - Wow! There! Gracias. And then we died... Hostel: Mexico, straight to DVD. I have told this story so many times, it's almost like it's a fantasy. This was real. This is real. I could stay in this place forever. I so wanted you to propose. I was going to. - What? - Yeah. I even looked at rings and everything, but... I thought you'd be mad. I didn't have a ring. No, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have been mad. Yes, you would. Hey. Hey. Okay, I didn't propose, but you remember what I said? I want to kiss you at the end of every day for the rest of my life. One for yesterday... one for today... one for tomorrow. It's so sad that we fell apart, isn't it? Yeah. - What's wrong? - What's happening? - What's happening? - Hey. Adrienne. What's wrong? What's happening? Adrienne, take a breath. Adrienne, take a breath. Adrienne! Okay. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Adrienne, breathe. Okay. You're okay. You're okay. You keep saying that, but clearly... What's wrong? - The water... You didn't see the water. - What? Just breathe, please. Breathe. You're okay. Look me in the eyes. There you go. That works. Okay. Okay. Let me get you a towel. You'll be fine. Okay? Don't move. It's over now. Where's the baby? No. No, you can't have her. Ellie? Ellie! Please! Somebody help me! Help me! Somebody help me! Adrienne! - She's not breathing! - What is it? Stop it. Stop it. Let Mama have the baby. - You're gonna hurt her. Steve! - What happened? Let go. Let the baby go. - Oh... - He can't have her! He can't have her! - Is she okay? - She's fine. - She's okay. She's okay. - It's okay. Adrienne, what's going on? He's coming... He's coming for her. - He's coming for her. - What? What's coming? - What are you talking about? - Dea... Death. Your mom tells me you've been experiencing some confusion since the accident. Are you in any pain? - Does that hurt? - I don't know. Adrienne, can you hear me? Do you know what day it is? Sorry, I'm not really here. Which one is it? She just needs her medicine. Take two pills, three times a day... She's gonna be okay. She's a strong girl. Thanks for coming by. I do appreciate it. Ellie wanted to say hi. Why don't you give her a hug? Okay, here, I'll take her. They've got her on so many pills, I can't even keep them straight. I'm just gonna sit here with you, okay? Just so you know. We don't even have to talk. She has physical therapy, and an appointment with a psychiatrist on Tuesday. Okay, well, you know I'm here if she needs anything. She'll be fine. I'm gonna take Ellie to our place for a while, and Steve will stay with her. Children need stability, and this just is not a good environment for her. So, the good news is, the other driver was at fault, per the police report. - Is he okay? - He isn't claiming any injuries. Will you be taking Matteo's statement separately to make sure we're telling the truth? Because it was not his fault. No matter what my mother may have told you. There was a witness who said he saw the other driver gun through the yellow. Do you remember that? Adrienne? Zombies? You hate zombies. They're my people now. I feel really connected to them, actually. They're very misunderstood. I... I know there's something wrong with me. Yeah. But you're gonna get better. If I was actually a zombie, would you tie me up and keep me in your garage? Yeah, I guess so. I've been always afraid of losing you, so, yeah. Because you knew you would? Adrienne... doesn't it make sense, right... that you're alive? That people can see you? They talk to you. You are here. But I feel soulless. Hollowed out. Do you remember when we realized we were having a baby? Please don't. You keep trying to prove that I'm okay, but I can prove I'm not. Can I tell you something? - Yeah. - I knew I was gonna die. What do you mean? She told me, when we went to the house to look at the broken window. I'm gonna check the window. - Hi. - Hey, welcome. - Hey! How are you? - Hey! - What are you guys doing? - A reading. - Oh, yeah? - I'm an assistant to Psychic Elaine. She's, like, the best in LA, like, the real, real deal. Like, not a storefront, like, otherworldly, and I'm studying under her. Wow. You want me to do a reading on you? - Sure, why not? - I can get you later. Just don't tell me I feel old because I think that much is obvious. Weird, your lifeline's really short. What? I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean death. It could be like... like you're not living, like you're not living life to the fullest. Um... Or I could be doing it wrong. No. Yes, it's crazy. I'm... It's true. I'm dead. I die in a car accident, two weeks after this. Whoa. That is crazy. We'll never get to move into this house. It sucks. But if you knew, why did you let yourself get into the car? Did you want to die? I don't know. I... This is grasping at straws, Adrienne. It's coincidence. That's what you said to her, but then... How old were you when your mother died? What... - Did-Did-Did you tell her? - No, I swear I didn't. He was 17. She's lingering for you. There's something unresolved. She says she wishes that you spoke at her funeral. That's it. Uh... Okay. That's our cue to go. Sorry. - You never told me. Was that true? - Ye... No. Well, yes. Yes. Yes, it was true. I was young. I didn't know what to say. I was mad at her, but that doesn't prove that she's psychic or that you're dead. I kept asking myself again and again, what is the point of life? Of us. You kept asking yourself what's the point of us. But then when I left Gary and Kevin's that night, I had a really bad feeling. Adrienne... - Hey! - I had this feeling like everything was falling apart. Adrienne. - You were pissed at me. - If we hadn't bought the house, - none of this would've happened. - What? It could've been a plane crash. - It's my fault. - Stop trying to find meaning in something meaningless and random. You didn't cause the accident. If there's someone to blame, it's me. Yeah. - I wanted to go out that night, so we did. - I didn't see the guy coming. No, no, no. I didn't see the guy coming. I wanted to stay late. Hey, stop hijacking this. Let me finish the story. I don't want you to finish your story. I want you to tell the truth. - You want the truth? - Yes! Fine. It wasn't all good. Do you remember that work event? You had just gotten your job doing grunt work at the museum. Oh, my God. Grunt work? I'm managing major design installations. This is not grunt work. I don't know why you took it. Well, aside from the fact that it's my dream job, some people actually have to work for a living, so that they can support their family, so they can buy a house. - Okay, yeah? - Thank you. Have piles of shit, right? Thank you. You don't want things? You don't want tools and tech toys and whatever other shit it is you get shipped direct to your garage? Okay, I'm just saying that if we stay in the apartment, we have a low rent, we keep some freedom, and we're not tied to a mortgage. If you're never tied to anything, then you'll never be free. What musical is that from? It's from Pippin. It doesn't... Doesn't mean that it's not true. What about this beautiful adventure we're on? You're going to be working from 9:00 to 9:00 every day. Gonna be laden with kids, the house, with no time to go anywhere. Not everyone can not finish school and not get a real job... - I have a real job. - ...and not care. - I have a real job. - This is what I want. If you don't want it too, you should just... get out of my way. See? Where do you go? - Adrienne. - Hey! How are you? I'm good. Champagne? Mind reader. Thank you. The look in your eyes. So alive. He is a work colleague, and he's on the board. - I am supposed to be nice to him. - Thank you. - For what? - For making this event worth attending. I'm... Yeah. Frida Kahlo and Maya Deren in one space? Be still, my heart. Yeah. I know I should be focused on the art, but I just can't. - Why? - You're distracting me. I just... I threw on... like, frazzled, like, whatever work thing. Don't underestimate yourself. Okay, fine. Fine. You saw that. So what? So what? I'm sorry. Matteo is trying to prove that I'm alive by making me feel, what, like, guilty? Thanks. He invited me to check out his woodworking. - The same night? - Yeah, I think so. I bought a bench. Oh! - Here it comes. - Such terror. You told me it was referred by a friend. How did you kill me that fast? I didn't even know you guys knew each other. Hmm. So you lied. Now you know the truth. Feel better? I'm just saying, most guys would punch a guy who was making moves on their girlfriend. Okay. You wanted me to punch him? He's got six inches on me. No way. Why didn't you just tell me you were jealous? I didn't think I could do anything about it. I mean, probably delay it. Did I? I didn't cheat on you. - Did you want to? - It doesn't matter. It matters. It fucking matters. Bullshit! Bullshit! That... That never happened. Okay. Look me in the eye and tell me I am making this up. You live so in your head. You exaggerate things. - You conflate things. - Stop lying to me. Stop ignoring... Stop disappearing on me. On our baby. Even me dying isn't enough to get you to step up. It's so unfair you expect me to fail. You can't pretend to know what's going to happen, how I would feel if I lost you. What fucking living hell that would be for me. Maybe I would never recover. Maybe I would be no good for Ellie. Maybe I would break if I lost you. Who is that? I'm gonna check. Hi, Steve. How you holding up? Hello, Father Richard. Proof that I'm dead. Your mother calls Father Richard if the milk is past its due date. Adrienne, I'm planning a bingo night at the church. What are you doing? I'm trying... I'm trying to work out - what to be buried in. - What? This one actually doesn't zip up at the back, but if you leave it unzipped, I don't think anybody's gonna notice. - Slow down. - Actually, I think I would rather be scattered somewhere beautiful. Oh, okay. You have a second chance, Matteo, and you've just got to move on. And you gotta find somebody that you love. Not Shea. Please don't marry Shea. Somebody... Somebody educated and somebody funny. Find somebody funny and just love them. - And let them love you. - It's gonna be weird to bring a girl with my dead girlfriend still in my bed, right? And I want my funeral to be fun. Not in a church, please. - Okay. - No matter what my mother says. We'll have a dance-pop party funeral. You're the one who likes pop music. I don't like pop music. I want Missy Elliott. Okay, we'll have a bunch of geriatrics dancing to Missy Elliott. Man, life. - Perfect. - What a tricky little minx. Hey, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. What the fuck are you doing? You don't get to be dead yet, okay? Fuck. So impatient. Adrienne. Hey. Look at me. So impatient. Shh, shh. Even having kids. You remember it? Last year. Día de Muertos. Stay with me. I know you remember. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'd be down. - Can we get two of those, please? Okay, I gotta say this quick. Uh, A wants a baby. - What? - Here is a cute... She's gonna break up with you if you don't pull the goalie right now. What the... We just started talking about this. He shouldn't have told you that. She said she was going to poke a hole in her diaphragm. I was kidding. I was kidding, obviously. Okay, it didn't sound like you were kidding. - Maggie. - I'm just being honest. Okay, she was upset, and I talked her down. So impatient. I'm just asking you to be patient with me, with us. - May I finish the story? - Okay, sure. I remember what else happened that day. Fucking Matteo! Hi! You said you were out of town. Uh... No. No. Um... - The-The trip got canceled. - Oh... It's so funny that Shea would know about a trip of yours that got canceled, - 'cause you guys don't talk. - This is not why I brought this memory up. - Hey! - Shea. - Hi! Wow, you look so great. - Hi. So do you, always. - How are you guys? - Great. - Yeah? Are you married yet? - Uh-huh. Oh, God, no. No, I cannot bear the idea of letting this oaf own me, but it's so great that you guys still talk, that you kept in touch. Even though you swore to me that you didn't talk to her anymore. Liar. Of course. I'm sorry we haven't talked. That's so... - That's stupid. It's so stupid. - No, totally. Right, right. We should have lunch. Lie. - Totally. - Lie. Hey, are you still, um, woodworking? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh. Amazing, because my dad just bought this huge property. So I actually, um... I might have a job for you. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - That's so sweet. - Yeah. This was the beginning of the end, wasn't it? - What? No, no, no, no. - Cool, so, um... It was so good to see you, girl. Hey. Bye. I love you. What? Why don't you just be with Shea, Matteo? Are you crazy? If I wanted to be with her, I would be. - Is that a threat? - No, I'm just saying, I'm with you. God, I was so much, wasn't I? No. We made up, didn't we? - Did we? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This... This wasn't the beginning of the end. This was the moment when we... when I told you... Hey. I wanna have babies with you, okay? I wanna have a kid. Let's have a baby. You only agreed because I threatened to leave you if you didn't. Okay, yeah, but I still agreed. Right? Because I wanted to. You're right. Let's do it. No, what's wrong? I'm so glad you said yes. And I'm so glad we had Ellie. Hey, what's wrong? I said yes, right? Hey. - Adrienne. - He's here. Who's here? Adrienne. Hey. Adrienne, talk to me. Adrienne, wake up. Hey! Hey, wake up. Adrienne. Adrienne, wake up. Adrienne, wake up. Wake up! Fuck. Don't do that to me, please. I don't know how to help you. This is bigger than me. You saw it. No, I didn't see anything. Let's get you out of this thing. I give up. I can't do this anymore. Wait. Okay. I guess I'll go avoid your mom. Hey. Go away. I can't. You can't help me. What if you're wrong? Adrienne. You want this to be the truth Ellie has to live with her whole life? Don't talk to me about truth. You were right about Shea. What you saw. Look, it's a job, a well-paid job. We can't afford to both take time off. No, you look, Matteo. You brought this baby into the world, a bastard. - Mom. - Well, she is. You did that. It's the truth. And now you turn your back on her? Look, Patty, go fuck yourself. Okay? - Matteo! - What? - You're gonna defend her crap? - Mom. Mom. - Please... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adrienne. I can't be around this. Thank fucking God! Are you kidding me? That was the only help I had, the only person I had. Please, stop being dramatic, okay? Me? You're the one who left. You're the one who couldn't handle it. And I stood there forever just hoping you would come back. Slow down, or you're going to get in an accident. I didn't. I just needed an escape. I was afraid of being like my stepfather. Of family, of all of it. All my life trying to avoid becoming that man, and here I am, just turning into him. You're not him. You're nothing like him. And when I got back to you, I swear, nothing happened because I was afraid you would... I was afraid I would lose you if I told you. Tell me now. And then... And then what? And then, I stopped. Because I felt like you were there. Like you were right there. And I couldn't be anything but yours. It was never clearer to me. I was just so ashamed of lying and of failing. I should have been honest about feeling overwhelmed. I should have stayed. I should have stood up for you with my mom. I just... No wonder you left. - I just made it so hard for you to love me. - No. I was always tearing it down and pulling you apart. No. Liar. We just had so little time. I should have loved you better. We still have time. We just got to hold on to it. Even if it gets messy and hard. Take the good and the bad. For better or worse. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Please. Do you remember the day we got married? What? Marry me. It's too late. No. No, no, no. Just say yes. Marry me. Yes. Adrienne, you are my best friend. Matteo, you are my calm and my truth. My strength, my compass. I promise to have the patience that love demands. I promise to be always yours. You know I don't believe in soul mates, but... I married you the minute I met you. And loving you is the closest thing to faith I've ever known. I promise to love you and let you love me. I promise to always be the person who earns your love. I... that one. I give you my hand. I give you my hand. And I give you my heart. I give you my heart. From this day forward... From this day forward for the rest of our lives. For the rest of our lives. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. And one for tomorrow. - You see, I'm dancing. - I can't believe it. Will wonders never cease? Look. Even the she-beast is happy. Now I know it's a dream. - You know how I feel? - Hmm? Alive. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, say it again. Say it again. I feel alive. You are alive, so alive. It makes sense. My ribs are killing me. - I'm sorry. - Stop pressing on them. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Ow. Thank God for seat belts. I'm so happy you were right. - Can you say that again? - What? - The-The part where I'm right. - Oh. You were right! You're right! I'm so grateful. I'm so lucky. Me too. Hello, baby. You're so strong. - You're so strong. - You gave us quite a scare, you know. - I'm feeling better now. - Well, you're a strong girl too. You know, Matteo really helped me. I know he doesn't share your beliefs, but he's a pretty extraordinary person. - I don't want to speak... - Can we not do this right now? I'm just saying that there is no reason why he couldn't take care of Ellie on his own if he needed to. - You don't have to attack me. - I'm not attacking you. - Adrienne. - Maggie. - Maggie. - Needs to get changed anyhow. - Come on, baby. - Hi. Oh, my gosh. Think you're still in shock? You know, I actually thought I was dead. - Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. - Dead. I just feel really raw. Yeah, that's totally normal. You know what? I'm here for you, okay? Whatever you need. Right now, we have to get you dressed because you have a doctor's appointment. Okay, Mom. This is Matteo. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, where'd you go? We should be home by... Sorry. Home by 2:00. Call me. How are you feeling? Like I don't want to be in a car. I heard you talking with Maggie, and I just... I'm glad that you have her to process with. Yeah, she's amazing. I'm not good at these things. That's okay. That's okay. I haven't known what to say. I've been trying to find the words, but I... I cook and I clean, and that's what I can do. It's okay, Mom. I'm okay. Got to take the good with the bad, right? That's life. For better or worse. I am just... I'm just so sorry. As a parent, all you want to do is protect your children. And right now, I feel this for you, the same way that you will feel Ellie's pain. What? Stop. Stop the car. - Jesus! Adrienne, what are you doing? - Honey! Adrienne! Come back here! Hey. It's over now. Okay? I'm going to get you out of here. Is the baby in the car? Where's the baby? Hey, where's the baby? Come on. I know you. You're the lady whose husband died in that accident. What? What did you just say? Hey. Hey, are you okay? I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Sit down. Hey. I can't breathe. Are you okay? Can you hear me? Where's Matteo? Where's Matteo? Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. You're okay. Breathe. It's okay. Just breathe. Just relax. Relax. Hey, sit down. Sit down... - You took him! - What? - You... You took him! - What? No! You took him! I tried to save him, okay? I'm sorry. It was... He was already gone. No. Adrienne! Hey! Hey! No! - Adrienne, come here. - I'm sorry. No, no. no. Come here. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. Don't worry. There you go. Be careful. There we go. There we go. We'll go home. We'll go home. How did it go? Adrienne? Adrienne? Adrienne. Please don't... don't touch me. - Slow down. Okay? - Honey. It's okay. What? I had him. He was right here. I had him in my bed. - He was right here. He was in my... - Oh, honey. I was the one that got hurt. He was fine. He was fine. Should I call Father Richard? Just get him to bring him back. Can he bring him back, please? I need him to come back. Please, Mom. I can't. Can I have a minute, Mom? Of course. I'll be right here if you need me, okay? You just... You just rest. Come back to me. Come back to me. Come back to me. Nurse practitioner Ramon to the Family Birth Center, Room 4, please. Nurse practitioner Ramon to the Family Birth Center, Room 4, please. She's still sleeping. Are you ready to eat? She hasn't had anything. I mean, they gave her some sugar water IV, but she's mostly sleeping on and off. Come here. Shh, shh. Whoosh! Come for a walk. Look. It's Daddy's chair. Should we have a rock? What do you think? The black one? What are you doing, you little monkey? Blow a kiss. Matteo was unassuming. He was kind and good. If he was here now, he would tell you that there's no reason for this, no purpose. Except what we make of it. Mommy, I'm up. I'm up. - I'm awake. - I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. - I'm up. - I know. Yoink. Come here, munchkin. Come here. T-bear. I'll get it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Okay. See who it is. Dolphins, where are you? They're coming. They'll be here. Keep your eyes open. - Here they come! Here they come! Here they come! - Pretty dolphins! - Hello, dolphin! Hello! - Look! Hello! - Hold on tight, okay? - Okay. Goodbye.
