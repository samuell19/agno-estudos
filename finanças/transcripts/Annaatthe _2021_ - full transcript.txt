D-4 THIRUKATTUPALLI POLICE STATION THANJAVUR-612101 Sit down. -Mr. Naatudurai! -Wait! Release four of my men… and jail these four men instead. An FIR has been filed. The ledger also has the records. It can't be changed, sir. If we can change hands properly, the fate itself changes. -So, can't we change the law? -We can't do that, sir. Well, it should change. Where's the paper? Where's the pen? Where do I have to sign? Here you go. Hey! We signed at this station just the day before yesterday! -That was in another locality. -Damn it! -Where should I sign? Where's the ledger? -It's over there. When there's a typhoon, we go into the house. When there's an earthquake, we get out of the house. We change so many things in order to survive. So, can't we change people? -Just do it! -Wow! That's an excellent example! You see, I am pressed for time. Now if you give me that book, I will sign on it quickly and leave immediately. Who are you? Go and sit there-- He will trash you on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday! -How dare you say that? -Didn't you hear him? Go and sit there! If I get irritated, I'll strangle you to death! He's the size of a mosquito and threatens to strangle us! If you do as I say, you will go back home in your jeep. If you don't, you will go home in a mortuary van. I'm an unscrupulous rogue. Excuse me, Mr. Rogue! If you just give me that register, I will sign on it quickly and leave immediately. Who is the rogue here? Isn't your name Rogue? My uncle's name is not Rogue! I told him! His name is not Rogue! Come on, it's getting late. Can we thrash him, sign the register and leave? It's our past trashing that brings us here to sign. Okay! Will you change or not? I'm a hot-tempered man. Excuse me, Mr. Hot-tempered! If you just give me that register, I will sign on it quickly and leave immediately. Who are you calling Hot-tempered? -His name is not Hot-tempered! -Really? Hey, listen to me! You are annoying my uncle! -This mosquito needs to be swatted! -Go away! -Come with me. -Beat him up, I say! Don't mess with me. I'm an awful person. Now I understand! Your name is Mr. Awful! Mr. Awful! -If you just give me that register-- -This one, right? Yes. Take it! Oh, God! Pachaikili! Look at this mess! This is like a shuffled pack of cards. How will we find the register here? We don't have much time. There are two people and four hands. How do we handle this? -Can we hire these useless men to help us? -Please! Hire us? Really? You think we will take money from you to look for the register? Who said that I'll be paying you? Singaarasu! The register! Do you know who I am? Mr. Awful, right? Annaatthe! Oh, no! The table broke! That's okay. It's an old table. Annaatthe! Do you know who you are messing with? -Tell me. I'm listening. -Tell him, Uncle! Annaatthe! Where are you trying to escape? Go look for the register, you airhead! -Annaatthe! -I'm sorry. Slash him! Just slit his throat. Listen up, everyone! Get here quickly and look for the register! Hey, Pulipandi! Hold on, Uncle. Let's find the register for him. He's getting late. Find it! How long will you all take? Uncle is all alone! -Found it! -Give it to me! -I found it! -Just give it to me! Uncle, move! We found the register. You can find my name and address here. -Take a selfie. -Yes! Here. You have my picture. We can resume our fight some other day. I can't do it right now. I've got some work. You kept saying, "Do you know who I am?" You are not known by your wealth or the fear that people around you have. It's your deeds and your words that define you. This is life sermon. -Pachaikili! -Let's move! -Greetings! -Greetings! -Where's the train? -It's close by. The train will stop just for two minutes. -Do not leave behind a single person. -Certainly! Stop and have your tender coconut. Here, drink up. Quench your thirst. -What's this? -Just have it. Give some more. Here you go! Take it! Eat properly. -Here's some cotton candy. -No, thank you. Drink up! -Here, take this. -Uncle! -Come here! -What is it? Why is the station in a celebratory mood? -What is the occasion? -Look to my right. Do you see a man wearing sunglasses? Yes. He's such a crowd-puller. Now look to my left. Do you see a girl getting out of the compartment? Yes. She's so classy! That's his only sister. You all have been given special treatment because you are traveling with her. Now look there. Is he trembling with excitement? Now look to my left. Oh, God! Is she looking for her brother as if she has not seen him in a decade? -Yes, Uncle. -Look over there again. Is he also looking for her as if he hasn't seen her in three decades? Why is that so? Did they break into a beaming smile? Uncle, you are in a different league! They're barely three feet away from each other… but they will run for three days. Now the two of them will stand in front of each other. Yes, they have come face to face. -My dear sister! -Brother! Now you will see them hugging in joy. You narrated everything without even looking at them. Do you have eyes in the back of your head? The story of his dear sister studying in North India, who comes down every week, is not just known to me. The train, the railroad and the engine could also weep like them and narrate it. Oh, yes! They are weeping. -What will happen next? -Both the kids will call me in unison. -Pachaikili! -Pachaikili! There it is! -My dear. -Brother. You have finished your studies. Hereafter you will stay here, right? -Yes, I've finished my studies. -I'm so glad to hear that. Your brother would be elated every time you came home for holidays in the last three years. The pain he suffered in your absence all this while… was just unbearable. Why are you telling her all that? Had your mother been alive… I don't think she would have loved you as much as your brother does. My dear… Please bear the pain! Hang in there. -Hang in there. -Mom! This child lost its father when it was barely three months in the womb. And now it looks like it will also lose its mother when it comes into this world. The umbilical cord is all wound up. How are we going to handle this? Oh, Lord! Please save her! I cannot do this. My body is giving up! I don't think I will survive. Son… please save this child. Mom… Please take good care of this child. I'm sorry. We could not save the mother. Mom! Oh, God! Mom! -Mom… -Dear… you have a baby sister. Every newborn comes into this world with the hope that a mother will take care of it. This child has come into this world wherein her brother is her only hope. Uncle, the lawyer's name is Pattammal. She's appearing for us. Madam… we have brought you from a different place especially for this case. If you win this case for us, my family and I will be indebted to you. Good will certainly prevail. Hey, old man! Why are you empty-handed? Where's the case file? Right behind me. My assistant is bringing it. Who is that? -Run! -Hi! -Hey! How are you? -I'm fine. You're happy because you have three wives. It's a problem only if you have one wife. Hey, Essaki! You have painted your house white, man! Is there an abundant flow of wealth? You are the reason we are happy! Oh, come on now! Hey, Mr. Awful! How come you are here? How are you? Your shirt is very nice. Who's the tailor? It's Tanjore Hanifa, the tailor. -Near the flower bazaar? -Yes. It's the same person who stitches secret pockets. Who are you? -His name is Kaaliyan. -He's from Soorakkottai. He's the president of all the neighboring villages. Madam… this elderly man sold his land to him. He had retained one cent for himself. This man cheated him and transferred that one cent of land to his name. The matter came to me for mediation. I passed the judgment that the one cent of land is his rightful possession. Now he has come to you because he wants it back. Madam… this man has signed this document. -I was unaware of what I was signing-- -I'll handle it. He was tricked into signing the document. He was ignorant. As per law, the truth is all that matters. You really hit the nail on the head! There is something that is greater than truth in this world. Justice. Justice is the greatest virtue. -Pachaikili! -Annaatthe! -He's thirsty. Please give him some water. -Sure. Please come with me. Madam, the piece of land that he's pleading for… is where… the memorial of his wife lies, the woman he lived with for over 50 years. He's not asking for that place because he wants to live there. He's asking for it so that he can be buried right next to her when he leaves this world. Please don't list the sections under the law… and separate them. God has bestowed you with knowledge and intelligence. You will receive abundant blessings. Ma'am, next is our hearing. Sir, please don't worry. I have explained everything to the lawyer. She will adhere to our request. You have said all that you wanted to say. I know what I'm supposed to do. That lawyer did not listen to you despite explaining the situation to her. -What now? -Annaatthe! What is it? The lawyer flipped the case! She set the truth aside, and proved that justice is above everything! Oh, no! Justice is greater than truth. You are honoring me for losing the case. What is the logic behind it? I just understand one logic. Some people smile when we are alive, and some cry when we depart. Now look at that old man. You have made him smile. That's true. We should have justification for the money we earn. And the justification should be our sweat… not tears of other people. -Pachaikili! -Present! Oh, wow! Look at that! I pay the price, and he enjoys the benefits. This is not the end. I won't stop until I get that piece of land… Even if you own 1000 acres of land, you can't take a handful of soil with you when you depart. They will dust you, disrobe you and make you lie down dusting the last speck of soil of your desired land off your hand! Power and fame shouldn't be used to forcibly take something from the poor. Instead, you should have empathy and be generous. -Hey! -Hey! Don't raise your voice. I'm a very rugged man. There's a way to deal with everything! Definitely not. I will either hug you… or I will shred you to pieces. Why are you confronting me time and again? I don't know, man! I end up fighting with you time and again. But you see, since the moment I met this kind lady, there's a sense of friendship, affection and affinity between us. -What do you say, Pachaikili? -Exactly! Yes. Unexpected! In the journey of life, no one really knows what will happen. We gotta wait! Why did you spare him? He is taking our lawyer away! There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle Oh! What's all this? What's this? And this? Come on! There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle My heart is brimming with joy In this cascade of happiness There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle There's boundless affection in our hearts Your eyes look for me I'm overwhelmed with joy When I'm flurried and I feel lost You hold me in a warm embrace You are as pure as the driven snow Your heart filled with love The calm weather Now changes without a warning It is mesmerized by your beauty There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle My heart is brimming with joy In this cascade of happiness There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle There's boundless affection in our hearts There's a music that I hear Is that your voice? Every time you are around me I feel unparalleled joy The Almighty has forgotten He has given crores of vows Love has dared to give in abundance There is no justification for it Destiny plays games with us And brings us together Shyness will gently crawl in And change our paths As we move from dusk to dawn Something strengthens our bond Oh, my dear! Now you're here! There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle My heart is brimming with joy In this cascade of happiness There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle There's boundless affection in our hearts When the breeze of love brushes me I understand the meaning of life No whether affects me anymore I'm drowning in your love You make my heart fly Like a bird soaring high The calm weather Now changes without a warning It is mesmerized by your beauty There's a gentle breeze with the drizzle Dear villagers! Our village president Kaaliyan's sister Thanga Meenatchi celebrates her birthday today. Let's greet everyone! We will fill the plates with all delicacies of this region. Come here! Come on! I want all of you to give her your blessings. -Goddess Kanchi Katamchi! -Goddess Kanchi Katamchi! -Kaaliyan's sister! -Kaaliyan's sister! May our Thanga Meenatchi stay blessed forever! Eat to your heart's content. -Enjoy the feast! -Kaaliyan! You arrange a lavish birthday feast every year. When are you going to arrange a feast in honor of a wedding? These old ladies can't think of anything else. -Pachaikili… -Annaatthe? Is their demand reasonable? I'm a father of two, and they asked me the same question! -When will there be a wedding feast? -Do you see that? That's all they do! No, man. We need to look for a groom. Let's gather everyone. Let's talk about our dearest Meenatchi's wedding plan. I know a potential groom for her. He works in an oil ship in Dubai and earns well. If we get Meenatchi married to him, she will never have a dearth of oil. Uncle… water is a demon for some people. But for you, it's oil. All near and dear ones, I request you to look away! Oh, God! Why did you slap me out of the blue? -That slap must have set him straight. -Hey! Why are you talking about Dubai? We shall look for a potential groom from America! What do you think? Shall we offer him a soda? Not just any soda. Offer him a colored drink. Well, that will be a bit messy. Why? All near and dear ones, I request you to look away! Oh, my! Listen to me closely. The potential groom's house should be within a five-kilometer radius from here. When this speaker blares, his house should be within hearing distance. His village should be visible when we climb the palm tree. To sum up, I want to be there for my sister… even when she merely thinks about it. Kaaliyan, we sent her to North India for her studies. -You should ask her what she wants. -Get him! -Catch him! -Hey, Kaaliyan! You can make a decision for her, but she's the one who will get married. You should ask her opinion. He preaches to the world. Can't he do it to this family? She's a young girl. She's not worldly-wise. Why should we ask her? Dear, do you want a groom who lives abroad? Brother… your decision is my decision too. -Pachaikili! -Ready, Annaatthe! What did you say, my dear? Your decision is my decision too. Say that again. Your decision is my decision too. Once again! Your decision is my decision too. -Pachaikili! -Annaatthe! Let's find the groom! Take it, dear. No, you take it. You go first. No, you go first. -Patt… -Kaal… -Come on, Patt-- -Annaatthe! We have come to see the groom. Place your romance aside for now. I can't take it. Just take it, you two! Please excuse us. We have enough wealth to accept a bride from your family. But we don't have the strength to do it. Why would you say that? Suppose that your sister and my son get married. One day when you come to visit your sister. It so happens that she's preparing onion sambar because my son likes it. She's cutting onions for the sambar… and she has some tears in her eyes. Well, then, you should be prepared to let go of your son! Brother! Run away! Run for your life! -It's okay. Calm down. -Annaatthe! There are so many types of sambar. You could use brinjal and okra! Why do you want onion sambar? Leave him, Kaaliyan! The court is closed today. Why did he make her cut onions? That's a pumpkin, Annaatthe! -We have come here for-- -I have a question! Let me get it at one stroke. -Kaal! -Patt! Okay. Do you like onion sambar? I don't like it, sir. -I like the groom! -He has been saved! We understand your fears. You are intimidated by Meenatchi's brother. Look at Mr. Kaaliyan. -He's courageous. -Patt… -He's majestic. -Patt… -He's noble. -Patt… Madam! You should be talking up our girl. But you are taking about the laurels of her brother! Give your son's hand in marriage. We'll ensure that he doesn't shed a tear. -That's true. -Well, Kaaliyan… -Please, Mom! -Let's say that your sister and my son get married. Let's say that! After some days, you'll come and visit her. For sure! You come over and see that your sister and my son are running around playfully. It's common for the husband and wife to run around playfully. Yes, Kaal. They could be running around playfully, jumping or hugging. It's very common. All of that when they are newly married! They are giving sermons about marriage! I think the brother will get married before the sister does. So, when you come over to see your darling sister… Welcome! You see my son and your sister running around playfully. And while they're playing… my son's hand accidentally touches your sister. You have been caught! I caught you! -You will be done for! -Brother! -Sir, please! -Brother, please spare him! Run for your life! Go! Catch him! -There are so many other games to play! -Please spare him! -I will not spare you! -Kaaliyan, it'll be attempt to murder! Why do you want to run around like that? I will thrash you, man! Sir, I won't even look at her! I understand. -Pachaikili… -Yes, Annaatthe? We are going to see the groom at Suresh's house, right? He called to say that he's purging, and he does not want us to come. -What about the groom at Murugesh's place? -He's calling now. Yes? He's our kid. He will not do anything without consulting us. He's asking you where he should go and hide. -Really? -Yes. It seems like everyone is deliberately avoiding us. Is it wrong to go and see a groom? It's not wrong to go and see a groom! It's wrong to be violent! Every guy is running away. Thank you. My dear… do I come off as a fearsome man? -You are like a baby! -Annaatthe! Your right eye is twitching. Uncle! That's you. Oh, my God! It's the atrocious sister-in-law! And there's the man who serves her as her husband. Brother, your left eye is also twitching! Uncle! Again, that's you! It's the crybaby sister-in-law! And there's the man who was married off to that woman. Ten years ago, you refused to marry me as we were blood relatives! And because you refused to marry me, I had to settle down with this trash! Do you how my life got ruined? Do you how it got ruined? You are rather shameless! She's talking about you! Hey! -Don't you dare… -Hey, Pachaikili! Ten years ago, when you didn't want to marry some random woman, I pleaded with you to marry me. But you refused to marry me! Do you even know that my life stinks? -Tell him! -Her life totally stinks! She's talking about you, man! -Oh, God! He doesn't understand that. -Listen to me. -You didn't want either of us back then. -We have even lost relationships. We cannot lose any more relationships. My dear brother! There's truth in his walk. He has a clear vision. There's virtue in his youth. He is Sathyaseelan, the embodiment of virtue. You should get your sister married to my brother. Hey, Uncle! I won't let my sister marry a man who wears a dopatta! It's my style, Uncle. You're not the CEO of Google. Take off your glasses, man! What is he looking at? He's eyeing the maids! How are you, potential groom? I'm good, Uncle. Your maidservants are amazing. Can I talk to your sister alone? -To hell with you! -Thanks! Babe! I thought I would pour my heart out to you. How many maids are there in your house? -Brother! -Is he the only one who knows? My dear brother! Is he a waiter at some restaurant? I wonder if he'll take an order. Her beauty is brimming only for my dear brother. He's a handsome lad! You should get your sister married to him. I would have lifted her as soon as I arrived. But that wouldn't be appropriate. You see, I'm patient. Should I ask her directly? Go ahead. Thanga Meenatchi, please don't get me wrong. I can't control my desire any longer. Brother… Move! May I take this sweet candy? Brother! It's for both of us! -Brother-in-law! -You don't get any! Get out of my way! Where are you taking her? She is for my brother! -No, she is for my brother! -Stop pulling my sister's hand! -She is for my brother! -Hey! -She is for my brother-- -Listen! Listen, you should get your sister married to my brother. That is the right thing to do. That's the only way our relationship will sustain. Oh, dear! Mangaya! Listen to me. Get your sister married to my brother. That's the right thing to do. That's the only way our relationship will sustain. -Our relationship should not end. -Brother! Run away, my dear! -Bro! -What is it, bro? I have something to say to everyone. -A family is like a banyan tree. -A family is like a banyan tree. -If we pour boiling water on one side… -If we pour boiling water on one side… -and normal water on the other side… -and normal water on the other side… -the tree will wilt. -the tree will wilt. -On one side, it's the paternal groom. -On one side, it's the paternal groom. -On the other, it's the maternal groom. -On the other, it's the maternal groom. They are like a pair of eyes. If you ask me which eye I need among the two… Which one will I opt for? -That's right! -Shut up! Ten years ago, he told us the same thing and got rid of us. Your brother! This time, we won't leave without acquiring what we had left behind! Tell us your decision! -What do we do? -Ask them for five days' time. I need five days' time. All of us will stay in this house for the next five days. And we will leave only with a positive response. Thanga Meenatchi, how do you dislodge food stuck between your teeth? No, not with your finger. With your tongue. It will be good for a selfie. Thanga Meenatchi, here's a gulab jamun. It is sweet. If you eat it out of my hand, it will taste sweeter. Try it. Brother! My dear, did you think about me? Yes! It's acceptable if you appear when she calls out to you. It's a bit too much if you appear when someone merely thinks about you! Well, that's how I am. -Even if a speck of dirt… -Or a mere hitch… -or a ghost… -or a demon… -or a scoundrel… -or a rogue… -or anyone gets near her… -Annaatthe gets an OTP. And I come to her rescue! You wanted five days' time, right? You are being insensitive and intruding! -You're not magnanimous. -You have no sense of faithfulness. Why should I be faithful to you? You have forgotten the past! You and my sister have gone to the movies a lot of times. One time, you made me stand outside with a piece of sweet as I didn't get a ticket. And when I accidentally came into the theater, I saw that there was no one else in there other than you and my sister! Have I told this to anyone? Why didn't you ever tell me about this? Why would I tell you if I haven't told anyone? Which theater was it? Was it Parimala theater, the one where people lie down and watch movies? -Bro! -Bro! It was a nice movie with the backdrop of a village. We were just talking. -It was about a landlord-- -I don't want to know. That doesn't matter! Uncle would frequently go into the sugarcane farm with my sister. I was the watchdog. One day, they forgot that I was there, and they went back home without me. I was unaware and I kept waiting till late afternoon. Have I told this to anyone all this while? Why didn't you tell me that? Why would I tell you if I haven't told anyone? Which sugarcane farm was it? Sugarcanes are as tall as two men. The farm is dense and dark! -No will know what's happening in there. -That's right. -Bro! -Bro! -It was nice and chilly inside-- -I don't want to enter that farm! -Your sisters and I were just talking-- -Bro! No one ever wants to listen to the truth! -Thanga Meenatchi! -Thanga Meenatchi! -They were just talking. -They were just talking. We should have trust. Life is all about trust. -Brother… -Sister? Before the movie is over, your head should be on her lap. And her head should be on your lap. Wouldn't that be uncomfortable? You two should be tangled. Sister, do you want a niece or a nephew? Twins. -Brother… -Sister? Before the movie is over, your hand should have ten fingers, and not just five. I don't follow. I want your hand to be intertwined with hers. Sister, you have only seen your brother eat all this while. You haven't seen him romance. Wait and watch. Super! Here. Annaatthe, I have 33.50 rupees in my bank account. I have 500 followers on FB, and I follow three people on Twitter. -Hereafter you will manage my accounts. -Why? Because I'm going to kill these two idiots and go to jail! When will this movie have action scenes? There it is. Someone, please check what happened! -Okay, it's back on. -Alright. Brother! Someone has put their leg on you! It is my leg! Brother! Where are your two fingers out of the five? They're gone! How am I going to eat my food now? Oh, my! How did this happen? They got hurt because of the action sequence in the film. How could they get hurt by watching an action sequence? Don't you cry when you watch an emotional scene? Don't you laugh when you watch a comedy scene? Similarly, you get hurt when you watch a fight scene. -Am I right, Pachaikili? -Absolutely! Oh, you! Oh, you! -Pachaikili… -Annaatthe… We have beaten up so many people. And all along, we have only experienced anger and no joy. But today, I'm elated after thrashing those two nitwits! Annaatthe, it's mediation time. Mediation for us is like eating a candy! What should we do now? Our suspicion has been confirmed. They told us they were going shopping. But they are right here. Kaaliyan is here too! Let's hide here and watch. -Pachaikili… -Annaatthe… I'm getting an important call. I'll be talking seriously. You handle both of them. Now that you've assigned me the task, just wait and watch. I will make them address you as "brother". No matter what happens, just don't turn around. Stop! Our village president is on a call with the American President. So, he has asked the hero to handle the situation. Hero? Annaatthe! Enough of your drama! These women are killing me! Can we take a break? Annaatthe! Oh, he will take whatever you give him. He will never say no. Hey, leave him! He's innocent. Let him go. What is it? What happened? -What? -Listen. Hey, what is happening? They are going to talk. Listen up. I have taken a bold decision. -A bold decision? -Hey! -Come here! -She's calling you! -She's calling you. -What is it? Tell me the truth. You won't get your sister married to my brother, right? Wow! It's almost as if you can read my mind! -That's why I have come to a decision. -What is it? You and I should get married. Our relationship will sustain. What about your husband? I will cut all ties with him. -Divorce! -Oh, God! What kind of a man are you? Don't you have any control over your wife? Look at me! She's ready to let go of you, man! I'm ashamed to call you my co-brother! Annaatthe, I doubt if this was their original plan. -Uncle! -Coming! They are making me run around! What now? You know what my bold decision is? You are going to divorce your husband?! Oh, no! -I won't divorce him. -Oh, good! He can't do without me even for a minute. Stay blessed. Hey, man! Yes? Your wife may be short tempered, but she's a virtuous woman. Yes. -Why should we hassle over court cases? -You're right! -I could take a really big log… -And? I can hit him hard on his head. He will die on the spot! There will be a condolence meet on the sixth day. And we can get married on the seventh day. Is that fine? Bro… I could easily squash you with my bare hands. And your wife wants to use a log! As per your family traditions, should I burn you or bury you? It has been proven. They have come here to reopen the closed account. Listen up! I'm going to see the lawyer. I am going to find a log. -I'm going to see the lawyer. -I'm going to find a log. Tomorrow is an auspicious day. We shall visit our family deity and arrive at a decision. You want a garland, right? I'll get one. Hurry up. Hey! Why don't you raise the beat? It's not as easy as beating people up! It's the drum beat that we need to raise! -Pachaikili! -Musically? Yes. Uncle! Uncle! -What happened? -Leave me! Uncle! It's that man who humiliated us at the police station! He's dancing in our village! Come on, let's go. Annaatthe, I thought we'd just beat the drums here. But it looks like we need to beat some people as well. Let's beat the drums and people together. Super! God! Let's run away! Annaatthe! Hey, if you cross that side of the wall, you hit me. When you get on this side, you let me hit you. What is the reason? Look at that side. You might be a bad guy, but to your wife you are a hero. And to your son, you are a superhero. You mean the world to the woman who trusts you. And for the child who holds your hand, the world is what you show him. You are the strongest in that world. I will not let you lose your dignity in that world. But that world… ends with the other end of the wall. If you cross it… I will break your face. Are you offering a silver motif to the deity? If you offer it to God, you will be happy. Try giving it to those who have nothing… and your God will be happy. Kaaliyan, the deity has been placed on the chariot! Kaaliyan, you started this practice when your sister was three years old and unwell. But she is absolutely fine now. You should stop doing this. Tell him, sir. Pierce a few more hooks, sir. All the wealth and happiness will be showered on you by the Almighty! Let all the blessings be showered… on my sister. Usually, you would have four piercings. But this time, you had eight piercings. What is the need for it? It's nothing. All my life, I've believed that our relationship is the greatest. And now we are talking about her marriage. So, I have understood one thing. Once Thanga gets married… her relationship with her husband will be the greatest. And when she has a child… she will have a deeper bond with him. I'll be watching them only from a distance. The child we brought up with so much love and care… will be given away to someone forever. When I think of it… I feel like a sparrow that has lost its nest in the wild woods. My heart bleeds! The man who comes into her life… should be better than me. He should be wealthier than me. He should shower more love on my sister than I do. Brother… you can wish for someone better than you… and someone wealthier than you. But… don't say that he will love me more than you do. I feel the same way. That's why… I asked them for four more piercings. What else could your brother do other than asking God for this? Why is everyone leaving? Are you offended by something? No. We're leaving because our hearts are filled with joy. Knowing that saying no would hurt us… we saw the pain that you endured all by yourself. Last night, after you spoke about the ideal groom that you want for your sister… the two of us made a decision. We didn't want to lose our relationship with you. So, we fought our way into this house. We learnt the truth when you said that love and affection is above every relationship. It's fine even if we lose this relationship. We should not lose affection. We should look for a suitable groom for Thanga Meenatchi. Welcome! Even when your enemy comes knocking at your door, you welcome him with a smile without asking him any questions. I'll tell you one thing honestly. You are a great man. When we locked horns the first time… you told me that dignity does not lie in your identity or your wealth, but in the name that you have earned. My hollow head could not absorb it. The next time I saw you… you told me that fame and good fortune is not easily acquired. You told me we should show generosity to those who have nothing. That didn't sink in either. Lastly, at the temple… you saved my pride in front of my family. You pretended to get hit by the man who came to hit you. Everything that you said… runs high within me and it feels as though I placed my bare foot on scorching sand. As you said, I started giving instead of taking. They respected me. They've always given me respect. Earlier, it was out of fear. But this time, it was out of joy. That respect started to haunt me. So much so that I couldn't sleep. Only then I realized… that fear vanishes when you overcome it. But respect… respect is immortal. It stays even after a person dies. That was when I decided… I will not antagonize you. I want to form an alliance with you. This is my brother. He's a doctor at the Government Hospital. Will you give your sister's hand in marriage to him? Naatudurai! Are you trying to deepen the hatred by forming an alliance? Our girl will not be suitable for your family. Sir… You say if you add a drop of venom into a pot of milk… all the milk will turn poisonous. Now can I rephrase that? If you add a drop of holy water into a pot of water… all the water turns divine. My family is the water, and your sister if the holy water. Kaaliyan, just as you wished, you have found a groom for your sister. Say yes. Your family deity and our family deity are suitable to form an alliance. I swear on the symbol of marriage. If you get your sister married into our family… I will take really good care of her. We came here for her hand in marriage. If you are not interested… we will graciously accept that we are not worthy enough, and we will leave. You can fight with 1000 people and win. But you have fought with yourself… overcome your demons and come here with folded hands. Your eyes now tell the truth. That's your status. Even God forgave you when you had a change of heart. I'm just a human being. Even if I get my sister married to a millionaire, he'll take her to the doctor if she falls sick. If I marry her to a doctor… The Almighty I pray to is making all the connections. That is true, Kaaliyan. This is God's will. -Am I right? -Let's fix the wedding date! Your brother is very happy! Are you happy? Your happiness is my happiness. -Pachaikili! -Happily! From the beautiful town of Madurai On the horse of our beloved He brings the garland From the colorful village With abundant vigor They will roll out the drums The blossom of the beautiful flower Is drawing us towards it She will dance beautifully Locking shoulders with the groom She has grown into a beautiful woman Carrying all the grace She will glide with the beetle leaves And the auspicious tray She is blushing in beauty You shine as the bright star Her bangles tinkle with joy The color of henna is red My queen, your smile is more vibrant! The color of henna is red The altar is your dream come true! Our idol is coming down Clap your hands in joy She will gracefully take the wedding vows She will step on the sacred stone She will fulfill her promises Will take the gift of love From her mother's house Beat the drums and blow the trumpet The time has now come To shower you with blessings Its time to hold the finger To fulfill your oath You need to fulfill your promise To jump around in joy He will take great care of you He will be as sweet as sugar The color of henna is red My queen, your smile is more vibrant! The color of henna is red The altar is your dream come true! When you plant a seed into the soil It gives you back in abundance Our girl will be supreme She will transform the house Into a divine abode It's not tall or short For both banks to become straight The pouring rain Will turn into a stream Don't take pride in superiority Let that rest aside If you stay united There will be a rainbow Man and woman Should live together in harmony And absorb goodness from this world The color of henna is red My queen, your smile is more vibrant! The color of henna is red The altar is your dream come true! The color of henna is red My queen, your smile is more vibrant! The color of henna is red The altar is your dream come true! Our friend will give you a change for this. -We'll need it for the rituals. -Alright. Uncle is on the call. You were angry that your name was not printed in English on the invitation. Why are you still there? The function might even get over. Come soon! What happened? -Just some trivial work. You carry on. -Okay. We are near the street next to the banyan tree. We'll be there in 15 minutes. Alright then. See you soon. -Where are they? -Near the street next to the banyan tree. The collector, tahsildar and all the officials will be here by six o'clock. Take care of the arrangements. Hey, what's the rush? Where are you going? It's nothing. You carry on. We'll be there soon. Where did she go? What were the women doing? Where the hell did you go? -How would I know? -Do something! What's wrong? Kaaliyan, Thanga Meenatchi is missing. Get aside. Thanga! Thanga… Ask them to look in the backyard. We did. She's not in the backyard. Did you look properly? -Yes, we did. -Oh, God! We searched the terrace as well. She's not there either. We searched near the shed and other places as well. She's nowhere to be seen. I checked with Meenatchi's friends. They don't know anything. There's no news at all. We searched all around the house. She is nowhere to be found. Kaaliyan, we have as many enemies who have turned to friends. One of them must have planned this. They must have kidnapped her! Oh, my God! Don't scream and make a scene. Who saw her last? Where was she and when did you see her? She did! This kid had seen her. Where did you see her? I saw her near the outskirts, Uncle. At what time? I'm not sure about the time. Please try to recall. I saw her when we were bursting crackers. We lit the fireworks at 8:30 p.m. The time is 9:00 p.m. now. It was just 30 minutes ago. Whoever has taken her and at whatever speed… we know the limits of the east, the west, the north and the south, and they could not have crossed that limit. Before this news reaches any more people, we need to save our girl. Come on! Let's find her! You guys go towards the east! Look for her! Search every nook and cranny! Come on! Go! How far are you? We are at the street's corner. We'll be there in ten minutes. Annaatthe, we searched everywhere. She's nowhere to be found. Check the crossroads and the junctions. Scan through every nook and cranny! Come on! Get in the car! Check! Stop the bus! Don't worry, sir. I'll ensure no one finds out. -Take care. -Yes, sir. Come on. Do you have any news? I searched all the nook and crannies and found nothing! -Where is the groom's family? -They are near the entrance. Go to the entrance! -Who kidnapped her? Who did it? -Kaaliyan… can we also check the open wells? Hey, what are you saying? Let's just go and check for our sake. What happened? Don't worry. She's not here. Thank God! Greetings! What happened? Kaaliyan, it's him! Naatudurai, quit playing games with us! Why did you kidnap our girl? I will butcher you! Get him! Don't talk through your hat! You can never take back your words. Don't accuse anyone without knowing the truth. Annaatthe! Annaatthe, Sekar is on the line. Yes, Sekar? Brother… What is it? Brother… What is it, Sekar? I have found our sister. Bring her back. Bring her home. Brother… What? She's refusing to come home. I don't understand. Brother… I've been pleading with her, but she doesn't want to come back. What are you saying? She's not interested in this alliance. She's in love with someone else. Put… put my sister on the phone. Brother… Put my sister on the phone. Okay. -Brother wants to talk to you. -My dear… Thanga… The whole family is waiting for you. Please talk to him. What's that noise? Please talk. Is my darling sister crying? She eloped! Ask them to kill the guy she eloped with and drag her back home! Tell them to do it, Kaaliyan! That'd be wrong. It's wrong. How can you say that? He's right. That girl ruined our reputation. Why should she be alive? Ask them to behead her as well, Kaaliyan! She's our girl. She's my sister. Uncle, you better watch your mouth! It's all because of him! I will slit his throat! Please let him go! Sekar! Tell my sister not to cry. Please leave him! I'm begging you! Please tell her not to cry. Please don't. Tell her not to cry. Don't cry, Kaaliyan. Ask your sister to come home. My brother will marry her. Sekar, put the phone on speaker! Brother, we have stopped the train. In the next couple of minutes, another train will come on this track. The station master has been calling us. What should we do now? Tell us! What do we do? Please say something! Tell us what to do! -I'll slit his throat! -No! Please, don't! Tell us! Why are you quiet? Just say the word! Please let us go. Ask them to go. -Kaaliyan! -Brother! Oh, God! You stayed strong even when your mother died. But today, I'm seeing you crumble for the first time! You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life You are my whole world You are the blood in my veins You are my gift And my greatest blessing You are the pain And you are the cure You have played The role of a mother in my life You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life Kaaliyan… Please forgive me. What grave sin have you committed… that I should forgive you? The night before the wedding… Hey, Meenatchi… Why are you crying, dear? What happened? Tell me. When I went for my studies, a boy fell in love with me. I also liked him. -God! -He's a very nice guy. Oh, my God! What are you saying? When I came back here and understood my brother's intentions, I changed my mind. My brother is the most important person to me in the whole world. So, I put everything aside. After finding out that my wedding has been fixed, that boy has come here. He attempted suicide! I just got a call that he is battling for his life in the hospital. What should I do now? How can I tell this to my brother? You need not tell him anything. I will handle it. You don't talk to anyone. Don't cry, my child. Hey, Kaaliyan! The guy who printed the invitation cards said that he never printed so many invites for a single wedding! Well, Uncle, there's no doubt about it. -You can ask Grandma. -Go ahead. You must have seen at least 500 weddings in your life. I got 10,000 invitation cards printed. After all, all our near and dear ones will be gathering here! Have you ever seen a wedding like this in your life? Did you see that? It's my Thanga Meenatchi's wedding! Today is the happiest day of my life! -Brother! -Kaaliyan! I'll be right back. Grandma, what did my brother say? What did he say? He asked you to forget about that boy… and get married to the groom of his choice. Did my brother say that? Did he really say that? Yes, dear. What are you saying? What do you want me to do? When you sit down to say something… people offer their utmost respect to you. You invited everyone to the wedding. Did you want me to stop the wedding at your place? Why did you do this? For my sister… I would have stopped my breath. Oh, God! Why wouldn't I stop a mere wedding? The people who came over are our relatives, Grandma. Thanga Meenatchi… is my life. I made a mistake, Kaaliyan. If every woman urged to live with their loved ones… no one would lead a peaceful life here. I thought Thanga Meenatchi would change her mind. But your sister… did not want to be a sinner. Instead, she made a sacrifice to be the culprit. JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURTS THIRUVARUR Yes, Kaaliyan? We have to find out where my sister is and meet her immediately. Okay. Thanga Meenatchi-- It has been over two months since the house was vacated. There's even a court order up there. No one is able to give precise details about her. They had two addresses. You search for this one… and I'll look here. You can seek help from your brother. No. I will not see my brother. I will never see him again. I began my married life with his tears. How will I ever pay for it if I don't suffer enough? My brother believes that I'm living a happy life. If he finds out that I'm struggling… he will break down. And if I hurt my brother once again… I will die. I will really die. I will bounce back very soon. Only then will I go and see my brother. But until then, I won't go to him. If I see him now, I won't be able to bear the pain. You've borrowed money from some people for the case. They aren't good people. You are going to their place. Please be careful. Sit down. Sit! So… when will you return my money? I will return it soon. Come on, sweetheart! I have antagonized a big shot for your sake. And you won't do anything for me! -You're so beautiful! -Please… You need not necessarily pay me back in cash. You're always draped in a saree! Hey! Where are you going? Hey! Where are you going, Meenatchi? Come on! Ask her to pay this month's interest right away. Or else, ask her to make me happy! Fifty thousand rupees! It should reach us in 15 minutes! We are waiting! Hey, look at that! What a funny guy! How did you get in here? Are you from Madras? Answer me. Thanks. Hey! Meenatchi… -Greetings, sir! -Pack all your things and vacate the house right away! What have I done? Where will I go if you ask me to leave out of the blue? I don't care about that. Vacate the house immediately! Leave right now! Hurry up! What are you staring at? This is where you will stay. Come on. -It looks like a big place! -Just do as I say! How can I stay here? Please try to understand. There's a girl who lives here. You'll share the apartment with her. I told you about a girl. She's the one. Come in. Come in. What's your name? Thanga Meenatchi. I'm sorry… I'm troubling you. It's not at all a problem. We will alternate the household chores. We'll be good companions and help each other. Alright? Just say yes. Yes. I will not see my brother. I will never see him again. I will bounce back very soon. Only then will I go and see my brother. Meenatchi… Meenatchi! Come, let's eat. I'm not hungry. What do you think of me? You stayed calm while I slogged in the kitchen. And now you say you're not hungry! Is this your plan to avoid cooking tomorrow? No! It's nothing like that. Well, then, you better sit down and eat. Okay. All this food must be eaten. Eat until your stomach is full. Eat now! Is she eating? She's eating Is she eating well? She's eating well. Did you give her the veldt grape chutney? She loves it. I have given her that. Alright. You stay next to her and serve her food. Okay, I will serve her food. You've finished eating already? The food was delicious. -Leave the plate there. I'll wash it. -No, I'll wash it. Meenatchi! Meenatchi! What happened? -What? -There… Oh, God! You're burning up! Wait. I'll go and get you some medicine. Don't be scared. I'll lock the door and leave. Ask him who is responsible for my sister's current situation! Who is responsible for Meenatchi's current situation? -I don't know. -He says that he doesn't know. Ask him! -What do you know about Meenatchi? -I don't know anything! -Leave me! -He doesn't know either! Leave me! Tell me! -I won't tell you! -He says he won't tell you! Tell me. Tell me! No! No… no! Tell me! I won't tell you. Tell me! I'll tell you! Manoj Bhaiya. All the top businessmen, politicians and higher officials of Kolkata let him hold all their unaccounted and illegal wealth. He's their black money banker. In order to convert black money to white… people like you, who have legal businesses, are used. He's in partnership with 28 such companies. We are here for the same purpose. We're not interested. Please get out. Those who have signed, have never consented fully and signed. They do it out of fear. Just get out! Why is he shouting? I only asked for 50% partnership in the company. It's not like I told him I wanted his wife. Just like your husband, I also come from an affluent family. You can sleep with me as well. Someone from a good family will never say such things. The hand that tried to slap me will touch my feet and plead with me. You will come wailing and you will hand over your company to me… within 24 hours. You killed him mercilessly. Arrest him. You can't go inside! Meenatchi, you can't be here! Please leave! Have you lost it? You are barging in without permission! Just do as I say! Wait right here! -He's innocent… -Keep quiet! Everything will work out just fine. -Please leave my husband. -He passed out from all the beating. They have taken him to the hospital. Hospital? Doctor! Arvind from the police station-- Arvind's condition is critical. They have taken him to GN Hospital. Oh, my God! Doctor, my husband was brought here from Marwari Hospital. How is he now? I'm sorry, ma'am. I think he passed away Please check at the mortuary. Please check if the name Arvind is on the list. It's not here in this list. Check at the main mortuary. Arvind Krishna… my husband. -Arvind? Wait. -Anybody with that name? Is this your husband's watch? Meenatchi… will you sign now? If you do, we'll show your husband… alive. I will sign! Arvind! Oh, God! Please don't hit him! Please ask them to leave Arvind! Please, I'm begging you. The police will listen to you. Please spare my husband's life. You spoke about my birth. Hereafter every day… you will wail in agony for being born. Please, no… You will lose your wealth, status and everything. Be it your husband's parents, relatives, the police or the law! Seek help from whoever you want. All those who come forward to help you… will lose their lives. Try getting your husband out of jail. Do whatever you can. Manoj Parekar is not an ordinary man. He has money, muscle power and very strong links. What can you possibly do to him? You're right. He has money, muscle power and contacts. And I have just one thing. Affection. History says that nothing has won over affection. You have only seen this villager as a modest man. You have not witnessed his rage. A wild river! A wild river… knows no boundaries, and nothing can control it. That man made my sister cry. I will make his flesh crawl. I will ensure that she doesn't shed another drop of tear. She doesn't want to see me until she bounces back. I will ensure that she gains back everything that she has lost. I swear on my mother. I will do this. -Go and check what's happening. -Sure, Arjun. Someone was beaten up and left hanging there. Why don't they understand? We have told our guys several times not to do this in public. Bhaiya… the bodies hanging up there… are of our men! Who could have dared to touch our men? It's definitely an outsider. We will track them down for sure. -Who's this? -Parrot. Green Parrot. Give the phone to your boss. Annaatthe wants to talk to him. Bhaiya is busy. The person who is keeping your Bhaiya busy wants to talk to him. He says that the person who is keeping you busy wants to talk to you. Who is it? It's some Annaatthe. Who are you? Who the hell are you? Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin. You have forgotten the same thing that these three men had forgotten. I have come here to remind you of that. What do you want? Ask me what they had forgotten. Those three killed several thousands of people. That's what history tells us. But there's one thing that history failed to tell us. Hitler died. Mussolini died. Idi Amin also died. Death is for everyone. It will come for you as well. Hereafter I will remind you about it every minute. And after that, I will tell you what I want from you. What have you got that gives you such courage? It's not always about what you have. Sometimes, it's about what we don't have. I swear on my departed parents and the Almighty that I don't have a speck of fear towards you. We will see. Yeah, we will see! I have offered you as a sacrifice to our family deity. And the carnival starts today! I have fenced Kolkata with the sacred festival thread. We have raised the pole. In the next 48 hours, I will fill up the pots, sprinkle the sacred water, have the bonfire and the wild dance, and I will offer you as the sacrifice. You talk with such valor. So, why are you in hiding and talking over the phone? Unbelievable! Which one of us is hiding and talking over the phone? I arrived here long ago. But your men didn't let me in. That's why I tied them up and called you up. Look outside. I am at your doorstep. Hey! Catch them! As a part of the opening ceremony today, the first act is… Fireworks! -There you go. One! -Two! -Three! -Four! -Five! -Six! -Seven! -Eight! Nine! And finally, some jack-fruit seeds. Manoj Parekar thrashing people has been the news so far. This is the first time we are hearing that you are being thrashed! The whole of Kolkata is talking about this. We have always believed that no one can lay a finger on you. That's why we have together given you 5000 crores. If the public stops fearing you, we will lose our faith in you. We are giving you one day's time. Finish off Annaatthe. Manoj Parekar, I have given you 500 crores! Return that immediately! Who is this Annaatthe? Why is he attacking you? Annaatthe commonly means "brother". Is all of this being done by your brother Udhav Parekar? Shut up! I don't want to hear that name! If someone mentions my brother's name in front of me… I will use your money to build your funeral pyre and reduce you to ashes! Damn it! Udhav Parekar! Boss! Ask him to kill me with his hands. I will die! No… just ask him to kill me! I will die! I'm begging you. Don't kill me with your hands! Don't kill me with your hands! I'm begging you. Whether we go for a fight or go hunting, we should finish the job with our bare hands. If we take a life or give our life… the bodies should come in contact. The body should shiver! Some guy named Annaatthe has killed your brother's men. He's at loggerheads with your brother. Shut up! I have warned you several times! Don't you understand? Do not mention his brother's name in front of him! Come, Meenatchi. What are you doing? Calm down and listen to me. I have reopened the case you had filed. There's no need to panic. Just sign on the case file. There's no need. Your life will be in danger if you help me. -Please. There's no need. -Nothing will happen, Meenatchi. -Please don't do this. -Just sign here. Please try to understand. Excuse me. She is refusing to sign. Repeat what I'm about to say. Kaaliyan? Just turn to my sister and repeat after me. Tell me. Thanga… Thanga… Listen to me closely. Listen to me closely. The truth is on your side. Even if the people around you abandon you… you are strong enough to stand alone and fight for your husband. You have immense courage. You are hesitating because your fight is against an influential man. You are not hesitating because you have no one. There is someone standing with you. You just don't know who it is. You just don't know who it is. I promise you… If a woman understands the power of truth and courage… God Himself will protect her from everything. Thanga, I want you to be brave. Those who are brave never face defeat Just sign the document. I will sign it. There was something about the things you said. It was exactly how my brother speaks. Meenatchi! Are you okay? Good news. You're pregnant! Apply it on her forehead. Why are you in tears? I'm thinking of my brother. In this whole world, I love my brother the most. I am his world. Once as a joke, I told my brother… "You love me so much. Will you ever love anyone more than you love me?" He instantly said yes. I was shocked. I asked him who'd that be. He said that it would be the child I bear. But now… he's not even here with me… to shower his love on us. Thanga… for every girl, the bond of marriage is like a knot of a rope. But the maternal bond for her… is the knot of her life. The knot only tightens when you go away. It will never come loose. I swear on the love you have for your brother… your life will turn beautiful once again. Trust me. There's a life growing inside you. Welcome it with a beautiful smile. You should be happy. Adoring you in flowers Decking you in garlands It's a vision I have, my dear! The well-wishers will gather And they will sing your praises They will bless you in abundance, my dear! I will be your shadow And walk beside you forever I will be your home I will be your roof I will protect you from the sun and rain My sister's beautiful visage Fills my heart with love The glow of turmeric on her face Makes me smile A new dawn awaits you You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life We both are flowers from the same vine We bloomed even as the vine wilted I took this beautiful burden On my shoulder And I realized That I would play the role of your mother You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my life… Greetings. You said you would invite him after I leave from here. Why have you brought the two of us to the same place at the same time? It's the inauguration ceremony of your father's statute. If I called your brother first, you'd get angry. If I called you first, your brother would get angry. It is only respectful if both came here at the same time. Did he agree to this? Well, yes. He did. Fantastic! You first seek permission from him. And then, you come and inform me. No, it's not like that. I know what you are trying to tell me. He's the legitimate son… and I'm the illegitimate son! Am I right? Manoj, what are you doing? Leave me. Manoj… My father had your mother as his concubine. So, I killed him with my own hands. And because she tried to take my mother's position… I butchered your mother as well. You were four years old back then. You fell on my feet and pleaded with me. My mother took pity on you. So, I forgave you. But you are not four anymore. Also, I don't have the heart to forgive you anymore. The life that father gave you was over when you were four. And ever since… I have been your father. If I know how to spare your life… it won't take me long to finish you off. You grabbed my collar out of rage! Annaatthe is out there. Go and catch him! The name Annaatthe is echoing in every nook and cranny of Kolkata. Search all the rooms! Go there! Look everywhere! Who is Annaatthe? What is his rivalry with alleged mafia business tycoon Manoj?

He's afraid and running for his life. We are hunting for him. For the welfare of public, the announcement about the celebrations is given by Annaatthe! The celebration will now turn spectacular. The next brutal activity is… sacred turmeric water celebration! What's that? He disconnected the call! Look it up online. "Sacred turmeric water celebration." -What is he going to do? -Be patient!

This morning, there was an envelope smeared with turmeric. What was in it? It had your photo inside. Behind it, they had written "10:25". It said I should kill you at this time. Or else, at 10:26 a.m. Annaatthe will kill me. Why are you here? I also received an envelope. What time has he written for you to kill me? It says 10:15. For me, it's 10:12. -For me, it's 10:20. -Bhaiya! For me, it's 10:22. He has told me to kill you at 10:28, Bhaiya. All of us have received envelopes. Where's Arjun? Call up Arjun! Annaatthe is chasing me! He has given 10:10 as my time to kill you! If I don't kill you, he says he will kill me! Go on a video call and connect to the television. Show me Annaatthe's face on the video call. Show me properly! Show me his face properly! Down! Show me Annaatthe's face! I want to see his face! Damn it! Arjun was here with me till 9:50. Now it's 10:08. He's in some building nearby. Where are you Arjun? He must be on the Terrace. Catch him! He's saying something! Listen! -Yes, Arjun? -Kill Bhaiya! Kill Bhaiya! Kill Bhaiya. If you don't, Annaatthe will kill me! -Kill Bhaiya! -What is he saying? Bhaiya… He is asking us to kill you. As he mentioned, he killed Arjun at 10:10 sharp. I have an important work. I am leaving Where are you going? Stop! I will be back soon. Stop, you scoundrel! -I'll be back in a jiffy! -Stop! Where are you going? All the routes to the terrace are sealed! He has sent a cover for you too? He has sent me all your photos. If I don't kill you at 10:30, he will kill me. We might hesitate to kill you. But if your life is in danger, you won't think twice before killing us! No doubt! We have risked our lives for you several times! Won't you die for us? The pulse is high and nerves are churning. The blood is boiling. The hall will be in shambles. Let the action begin! Stop! Madurai Veeran is coming In complete rage Madurai Veeran is coming In complete rage The fire is burning in his eyes Who can face him? The evil that besieges Will be reduced to dust Did my sister come to the bank of the river? Yes. I have come to the place you told me to. What should I do? Thank you. Good evening, Manoj. Annaatthe? Whose representative are you? What do you want? Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? For the entire sin that you have committed. I come as an embodiment as a single man. -Bring that! -Alright. Are you going to kill me? Kill you? Death will be forgiveness for you. The life that you are going to live will be your punishment. Hereafter you will run for your life every day and live in fear. You will be in hiding and you will be ashamed of yourself! Brother! Bhaiya! Bhaiya, the enemy is here! Come out, Bhaiya! Bhaiya! Your enemy is here! Come out, Bhaiya! Come! Come on! Bhaiya! Come! Bhaiya, your brother is here! The verdict is in your favor. Your husband will be released tomorrow. You have regained the life that you have lost. What else do you want? I want to see my brother. Even if you cross the ocean… you can't cross the shadow of your guardian deity. I have been constantly missing my brother. Tomorrow, along with my husband… I'll go home and meet my brother. -Pachaikili! -Annaatthe? My sister will leave early to come and meet me. We need to take a flight before that so that we get there on time. Annaatthe, you are already flying high! Breaking news! There is a rumor that Manoj Parekar has been killed by his brother Udhav Parekar. This news is spreading like wildfire. The two-dimensional war between Annaatthe and Manoj Parekar has now become a three-dimensional war because of Udhav Parekar. That man grabbed my collar! I wanted to kill him with my bare hands! I spared him because he was your brother. And now… you have killed him with your hands. How did you kill him? Everyone said that I was not born for my father. I never believed what others said. It's my father's blood that runs in my veins. I had immense pride and arrogance. But it doesn't look like it. I was not born for my father. But you… you are the true heir! Could Annaatthe have laid his hand on you? I don't want to live this life with the alms given by Annaatthe. Kill me! I want you to kill me! Kill me with your hands! Kill me! Won't you kill me? You won't kill me, right? Well, then, I will kill myself! You can tell the world that… you killed me. Before you bury me… you should kill Annaatthe! And… place his head on my feet and then bury me! You did not want to die at the hands of a stranger. So, you came here to die at my hands. I am telling you… you are Parekar's dynasty! You were born to my father! You are my blood! You are my brother! I did not say anything. All his wealth will come to you. That's why I spoke like that. All his wealth will come to you. That's why… I did not get my brother's money! I did not get my brother's wealth! I only got my brother's rivalry! The rivalry! Your brother has signed to return the money to 20 families. I don't know which family Annaatthe belongs to. Go to those 20 families. Hold a knife against their throats. Quiet! Shut up, or I'll kill you! Do that and… call me. We did what you asked us to, Bhaiya. Check upstairs, in room 304. Stay with my sister. Lock the door. No matter what happens, do not open the door. What happened? Nothing. You carry on. We have already held a knife against their throat. But we have not heard from our men who have gone to one family. Call the men who have gone there. None of them is answering. Our men aren't answering. Who all are there in that family? As per the address, it's Arvind and Thanga Meenatchi. It's Annaatthe. Udhav Parekar! Annaatthe here! How you live… depends on the friends you earn in life. And how you die depends on the enemies you make. Under no circumstances make Annaatthe your enemy. I have seen many enemies in my life. Enemies who have made me sweat. And enemies who have made me shed blood. But you are the first enemy who made me shed tears. Eliminating you is not my duty… but my right! So, shall we clash? Let's clash! -Can we clash now? -Let's clash! Do you see? None of them is stopping the vehicle. I told them, "You won't get a reward for killing Thanga Meenatchi. But you will not live to see another day if you don't kill her." Tomorrow on the banks of the river, the immersion will not be… for Goddess Durga's idol! Instead, it will be Thanga Meenatchi's corpse. Yes? Take care of Thanga Meenatchi. I want you to be alert. I'm on my way. Come with me. What happened? What happened? Where are you taking me? Where are you going? Who are they? Move! Make way! Move! Where are you? -I am unable to tell precisely. -Who are you talking to? Come! Who is chasing us? I have seen you. Do as I say. Alright. Someone is behind you. Hide. Vanish. What's going on? Come on, guys! What should we do now? Tell us! Get into the taxi! Just keep going! Keep going. Whom are you talking to? Please tell me. Who is helping us? Keep going. Tell me! As you told us, we got out of the taxi. Please tell me, whom you are talking to? Where are you escaping? -I won't spare you! -Die! Whom are you talking to? Who is helping us? Stay there until I ask you to leave. Who is it? Please tell me. Look over there! Come out now. Come! Come! Meenatchi! Hey, she's over there! Meenatchi! Catch her! The girl is there! Let go of me! Who did this to you? Who saved me? Tell me. Please tell me. I'm begging you. Who saved me? Where? You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life You are my whole world You are the blood in my veins You are my gift And my greatest blessing You are the pain And you are the cure You have played The role of a mother in my life Brother… I know you are here. Please come to me. Come on, Brother! Please come out, Brother! I just want to see you. Please come. Thanga… I made a big mistake. How could you… how could you forgive me? You did not make a mistake, dear. I made a mistake. When you reached puberty… you came running to me… and you told me that you were bleeding. But when you fell in love with someone… you didn't have the courage to tell me about it. I had unreasonable expectations from you. And you have immense respect for me. That is what stood as a mountain between us. The fear didn't let you open up to me, my dear. It didn't let you. Why should I forgive you? How can I hate you, my dear? I love you immensely. No matter what happens… my love for you will always stay the same. You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life Let love, affection and truth be the foundation of every relationship beyond expectations and obligations, making it last forever. You are my gift And my greatest blessing You are the pain And you are the cure You have played The role of a mother in my life I am your darling sister This is the purest form of love I am your darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my life You are my soul Even when I went far away from you You always protected me The distance between us never mattered You left no stone unturned Like shade in the sun And shelter in the rain You were always by my side Even when a storm rattles the earth You protect me tirelessly The bond only deepens and grows stronger As I hold on to my brother's hand And continue to live this life Your sister is overwhelmed with love You are my life You are my soul You are like my eyes You have guided me all my life You are my whole world You are the blood in my veins You are my gift And my greatest blessing You are the pain And you are the cure You have played The role of a mother in my life I am your darling sister This is the purest form of love I am your darling sister This is the purest form of love You are my life…
