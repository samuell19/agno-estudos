Order them to approach the plane with caution. Yes, sir. Approach the plane with caution. We're ready, sir. Move in. Everybody get down, now! This is Commander Chan speaking. Report status immediately. They'll never... give in... Commander Chan, you betrayed my trust. You attacked us. Listen Kiang. We shall never give in to hijackers or terrorists' demands. I've also alerted Taiwan about the situation, so you can't land there. In that case, Commander, watch your sergeant die. All right, Commander, send the tanker to fuel the plane now. Don't you understand? There's nowhere else to go, so what's the point? And that's all your doing. This is hopeless! Give yourselves up! It's too late for that. So you'd better give in to our demands. If you don't have the fuel ready in five minutes, we'll start shooting hostages. You heard him, Officer. Send the tanker now. Prepare for takeoff. Commander, order your men to back off, except for the fuel attendant. I've just connected the fuel line. Nobody seems to be watching. Proceed with caution. Red One, what was that noise? I'm unloading the fuel. I'm moving toward the rear entrance. Hey! Get back! All right, start the plane! Go on, damn it! Arthur! Joe! Are you all right?. Talk to me, man! Joe! Joe. Retreat, Red One! Get out of there! Red One, retreat! Do you hear me? Damn it! It's the control system. - Where is it?. - At the back. According to the report, You went after the hijacker against Commander Chan's direct order. Why, Officer?. General, those hijackers are a bunch of terrorists. It is my duty to combat terrorism. And to follow orders. Yes, sir. Although you saved those hostages, you have violated the army's code of discipline. You put the whole team at risk. Therefore, I've decided to have you transferred to the Chinese Embassy in Lavernia...immediately. Wish I was that baby's dad. Yeah. - Well, well, Andrew Kwok. - Long time no see, Arthur Dong. You're late again, as usual. I couldn't disappoint you. You're hopeless, you know that?. I'm glad you're here, in spite of the circumstances. This dump might be bearable with you here. What are you talking about?. Lavernia's a great place! Is that your luggage? Interpol agents? Come on! Hey, you! Hey, why are these cops making us wait for so long? That's typical of the Lavernians. Don't be surprised if they're not very accommodating, especially to us Asians. Well, since this is their country, we've got to stay out of trouble, otherwise there'll be problems. If you do get in a fix, say something like... I couldn't help it or it was unavoidable. That'll help. Well?. Say something. Listen. Mishima... - Ever seen him? - Look, it's your guy. Great, he's all over the news, the Ambassador will be furious. Now we're in deep trouble. Uh-oh, they're here. - Mr Ambassador, Mr Secretary. - Are you Officer Dong? - I'm to blame, sir. - Blame? Yes, sir. I should be held responsible, since he's new here. The fault is mine. Listen, no-one is blaming you for anything. In fact, you've both been invited to the President's banquet tomorrow. - Hear that?. We'll probably get... - Remember... look smart and be on your best behaviour. Is that clear?. Yes, sir! Officer Dong, welcome to Lavernia. I would like to thank... the Lavernian government, my mother and father... Andrew, are you all right?. What's the matter?. We caught the guy, but nobody gave us credit for it. It's not the medal, but... Does this go on all night?. - I propose a toast. - Cheers! Wait! A toast to what?. To our protest. Let them look down on us, that's their loss. We're still the best! You know something else? I even told my girlfriend I'd be getting a medal tonight! So get yourself a fake medal! Looks like you need some company. I'm Lone Sung. I own this bar, and I know that look when I see it. You're homesick, right?. It isn't easy for us Chinese to build a life in a new country. So I opened this bar, where we can all drink our sadness away. Yes, sir... Nobody here calls me sir, it's just Uncle Lone, OK? You know, young man... I'm Arthur Dong, call me Arthur. - Dong, let's do it! - Sure! Come on guys, watch the show. That was great! I never thought You danced that well, Andrew! - You guys are fantastic! - Not bad at all! Tammy? Let's get out of here! - But my wife's badly hurt! - I'm going alone, then! - Tammy! - Arthur! Let's get out of here. - And go where? - Anywhere! You can't desert your country! Oh, my God, she's dead! How could you let this happen? - Arthur... - Tammy, the boat's leaving! - Come with us. - I'm sorry, I just can't. It's strange that after all these years, we'd end up feeling like we were total strangers. I guess I'm just a little nervous about seeing you again. I didn't know what to say...although it's really good to see you again. I like being near you, so I was glad to hear You were transferred here. Who told you? Andrew told you, didn't he? One second... You never wrote to me. Would you have replied? Is that why You're still angry with me? It's a lot deeper than that. You left me just when I... There was a revolt, remember?. I had no choice but to run away. So you think running away solves everything? I was afraid I might die there. I would've protected you! I got scared. I was really scared then, OK? You didn't trust me then, that's why you left. You didn't care about me. And now suddenly you show up and think everything's the same. So, you don't trust me any more? Trust?. You want to talk about trust?. Not only did you leave me, but our country, too. The country where you were born and raised. You left without a word, and now you're asking me if I trust you? Now you're living somewhere much colder than Beijing. It won't be so cold now that you're here. I don't know. It's not the same any more. You kids just love your heroes. That's from watching so many movies. You've always been my hero, Uncle Lone, we can always rely on you. Tammy needs a room. We've been friends since we were kids and I was wondering... could you let her stay here? That's if it wouldn't be a problem. Sure, why not?. Have this liver. You look pale. Thank you, Uncle. - What about me? - Forget it! You're strong as an ox - You could take on all the blondes in Lavernia. I'm such a hunk! There you go again! Stop bragging about yourself. How do you put up with this airhead? - So where have you been? - Croatia. She left Beijing in 1989, during the revolution. And went to an even messier war there. At least now she's all right. It's never easy to grow up alone. What matters is that we stay whole. I've something you might like. I'll show you. - Recognise it?. - Duckweed. Although they have no roots, they still manage to survive. - They're lovely. - Great. I have an extra room upstairs, and I'm going to let you stay, if you take care of these. I will, Uncle. Look out! Get down! No! Ambassador. Officer, the Defence Minister called earlier. Mishima wants to see you. For what?. I've no idea, but he said it's important you see him. - Should I go, sir?. - That's your decision. In that case, since I've nothing to be afraid of, I'll go see him. - Yes, miss? - I'm looking for Officer Dong. - Your name? - Tammy Chan. Please wait here. Sorry, miss, but he isn't here yet. I'll just wait here. Sorry miss, but this is an embassy compound. You'll have to wait outside. OK, thanks. Hey, there's a lady waiting outside for you. Come on Arthur, let's play again. Ready? One, two, three! Gosh, you won again! That's because You let me win on purpose! Will you always be this nice to me? My daddy is always nice to my mummy. I never saw my parents. That's all right, you have lots of friends at the training centre. As soldiers, we'll protect our country. Are you going to protect me too, Arthur?. Of course I will. Chong said something about swords: "There are three kinds of swords - for commoners, nobles and kings." You think I'm nothing but a heartless killer. Well, you're wrong, for I bear the King's sword, and I was sent by God to cleanse this world of sin and corruption. A true king's sword is never used to hurt or kill, and a true king should rule with kindness and love. Confucius' teachings have made you softhearted, Officer. Let's just say my conscience doesn't bother me. You think I enjoy what I do? That I don't suffer every time someone dies? Well, you're wrong. You can't imagine the pain I feel whenever I kill others. But I was chosen to bear the cross of the sins of the world. That is my destiny. Take Hitler. He was also lonely and misunderstood. Every great hero goes through this. I suggest you see a psychiatrist. You're no hero. You're just an insane egomaniac. I can sense your disillusionment. Join me and we can serve our divine purpose together. Is that why you wanted to see me? I'm sorry, you got it wrong, I'm not interested. Officer Dong. What I'm offering may be your last chance of walking into the light. I've always been living in the light. Good morning, Arthur. Here, I made you a coffee. - You're nice today. - I'm always nice. - How is it?. - Tastes great. Yeah, it's from Croatia. - Tammy bought it. - Meaning? Are you still angry with her?. The Ambassador will be late for his meeting. Wait! What about your coffee? What?. Arthur, wait! Hey, Arthur, I hear Your girlfriend was here yesterday. Tammy Chan, right?. Andrew told us everything. Right, Andrew? Arthur, listen. Our country's revolution started because of a misunderstanding between our government and our own people. Yet you stayed in China and gave her a chance. Why don't you give the same chance to Miss Chan? Thank you, Secretary Wong. - Good morning, Ambassador. - Good morning. Let's go. Cover the Ambassador! Secretary Wong! I'll take care of him! Over here, hurry! The Holy War has just begun! Hail to the new Messiah! And that one. You'd better go inside. Wait! Tammy, where are you going? I need to see Arthur. What?. You're staying right here. But I... Come here. You'll be attacked by the Lavernians! They can't tell Chinese and Japanese apart. That's why I've closed up. Don't worry, I've seen worse things, I'll be fine. I'll be back later! Bye! Don't hurt me, please! I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese! Listen to me, I'm Chinese! I'm innocent! Please don't hurt me! Don't! Please, don't! Let me go! Please, I'm innocent! I've been looking for you all day. It's all right, I'm here now. Sir?. Do it for the boat people. I don't feel good about this. What if something goes wrong? Well, we have to do the right thing. Gentlemen, the Holy War to save our master is about to begin. Hey, has it occurred to you that they might just have surrendered Mishima's double to us? Can someone say something? The silence is driving me nuts. I wasn't talking to you, so shut up! You crazy bastard! Cool it, OK? Well, it's the truth, he is crazy. If you're getting nervous, spit it out. Sure! Andrew, cut it out! Go ahead - feel sorry for a guy who kills for fun! Oh, shit! I don't feel good about this, guys. Stay calm. It's all right. Just drive slowly. Everything's going to be all right. - My God! - Reverse! Are they rescuing or killing the bastard? ! Move it! - We're dead! - No! Straight ahead! Gimme that! Chaaaarge! I haven't had so much fun in ages! - Enough! We have to get going! - Yes, sir! - It's an ambush! - Get him. Take cover! Move! Enemy at 12 o'clock! Forward! There's too many of them! Get back! Listen to me! I am your messiah, I've come to usher in a new era. Hail to Mishima! Hail to the Messiah, master of the new era! - Hail to the new era! - Hail, hail! Hang on, my children! For I will take away the sins of the world. Move it! Come with me! We can still save this world! Let us die together! Father, we are coming! Our time is coming! Tony! Arthur! Andrew! - Andrew, no! - He's already dead! Andrew! Sato, come in, please. Sato, are you there? Please, respond! He's dead, you motherfucker! And so are all your men! Recognise my voice, Arthur?. This is Uncle Lone speaking. I'm the commander of Red Sun in Europe. Right now, we're inside the Chinese Embassy. We've taken your ambassador hostage. Bring our master here within two hours or we'll start executing every hostage here! Talk to him, Tammy! Arthur, don't listen to him, it's a trap! Goddamit! Thank you, dear. You just gave him another reason to come over here. You poor girl. You always get Yourself into the wrong places. And now you must pay for my kindness. Master. Let him go, Arthur. Release all the hostages first. You're in no position to bargain. I'm ready for the worst. We're ready to die for our master. Long live the Messiah! You are brave. Tammy looks at you as some kind of hero. You're tough enough to come here alone to save all these hostages. You know that their lives depend entirely on you. Tammy, you were right about him. Arthur! Why don't you join us? It's pointless to serve their worthless cause. We can turn this into a new world - a better world. I've no interest in serving your cause. You're a bunch of madmen. Be careful of what you say. Arthur! Let him go or I'll shoot! - Shoot me instead. - Sit down. I represent the Chinese people, and she's Chinese. If you intend to shoot her, you must shoot me first. This for someone who deserted China! Did you know that?. She's still Chinese. Tasta! Just get it over with! Uncle Lone, don't listen to him. I still believe you're on our side. I'll count to three, and you'll let him go. One... two... three! Let him go, Arthur. Go on, shoot. He's not afraid to die. Arthur. Arthur! One... - Arthur! - Two... All right! I'm free! Long live the new Messiah! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! - Tasta. - Yes, sir. Well done. Since I am the new Messiah, it's my duty to send the unworthy to their deaths. I already gave you a chance, but you refused to be saved. Now it's time to say goodbye to this world and those you tried to save. Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Hang in there, buddy! Someone get me out of this thing. Let him go, I said let him go, you bastard! Let him go! Tammy, it's all right! Look, it's me! I'm here! It's all right! - Let's get out of here. - I have to stay. Join the others. It's the police. Please don't. Don't shoot us! Don't... don't... Great, help's here! Hey, over here, guys! We got rid of the terrorists! Come on! Come on down, it's all right! Get down! What's going on? They won't let us leave the compound. - Where's Arthur?. - He's still inside. No, Miss Chan, come back here! Tammy! Tammy! Arthur?. Arthur! Tammy! Arthur... Tammy. Look, Tammy, I've got your hero's trousers again! Come on, Arthur! Catch me if you can. - You can't catch me! - Give it back, Andrew. Hey, wait for me. Arthur, don't leave me!
