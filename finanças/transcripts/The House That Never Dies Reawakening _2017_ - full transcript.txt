Yes, it's me, Mr. Wang. Thank you. For trusting me. I am going to visit you some day and invite you to have a meal. Mr. Li. Alas. Go over there. - Look. Mr. Song, he said... - Over there. Yes. We are on the site. Well. I will call you later. Okay. Come on. Ah. Take care. Ah. Put it down. Take care. I need some people here. I am coming. Two of you on this side. Give a hand. Alright. Take care. Mr. Song. Come here. We have excavated something. Go. Monitor the heart rate and obtain the intravenous access. Her pupils are dilated and have slow light reaction. Come on. Do tracheal cannula. Intravenous injection with 1 mg epinephrine. Tracheal cannula succeeds. He has ventricular fibrillation. Do we have to do defibrillation? Do it. - Morn. - Doctor. What about the girl inside? What about him? - He is out of danger now. - I want my morn. Morn. It's okay. Take good care of him. Help him dress his wounds. Okay. Morn. Doctor. I need a doctor. Sit. Sit down. Don't move. Do you hear me? What happened to him? Drunken driving. He destroyed a happy family. He just got a little injury, while he is yelling. - I hate this kind of people. - Give me a shot to kill my pain. He did harms to the others and himself. Do you have any good doctors? "I'll be home" Sit down. "late since I'm still at the construction site." Behave yourself. "Happy 7th wedding anniversary." You shouldn't drive after drinking. Doctor He. She is calling you. Well. I'm coming. Be careful. Take it slow. Well. Everybody, back off. Be careful. Okay. Ah. Mr. Song. Come over here. It seems like a human. There is a spell saying, some immortal is suppressed here... No-. Don't move it. Mr. Song. It's abnormal. How about inviting a master for a religious rite to drive out the evil spirit. Right. It's normal for us to excavate something. We shouldn't scare ourselves. Mr. Song. I don't think so. I've heard that this house is abnormal. I want to leave now. If you want to keep safe, just go with me. Let's go. Don't leave. We have a lot of work to do. Don't go. Song. What to do now? Are you afraid? If you are not afraid, I will never feel afraid. Alright. I will call the headman and ask him to find us some workers. I am not afraid. Doctor He. Are you still awake? Today an uncle who was drunk came to the hospital, so you are not happy, right? Who told you that? Shanna. She said you would go mad when they were sent to hospital because of drunken driving. Is it because of me? If the uncle was not drunk, you would not have to stay in the hospital. But I can see you here. I will cure you for sure. And the little sister. Can you cure her? Who is she? (Song Teng: Something wrong happens on the site, so I can't come back) Go to sleep. Good night. Good night. Good night. Today is your seventh wedding anniversary, isn't it? You don't want to miss it, do you? I'd rather save more people. Well. Song Teng can understand it. Silent, solitary, I step up the western tower. The moon appears like a hook. Let's go. Hmm. What for? Ah. Will you get in? No. We are taking the stairs. Thank you. Bye. Wow! You are so awesome. It's really better to do it like this. Take care. Like this. Every man is no different. They may have a crash on some other girls to your face. A little more, okay? Hmm. Is it enough? Ah. Why are you here? Happy the seventh anniversary. Happy the seventh anniversary. The seventh anniversary? Why are you still here? You should go home now. It doesn't matter. It's for work. I see. Let me introduce you my wife He Fei. This is Lin Yao. She is the daughter of my master. She comes here for the No. 81 project. Oh. Give it to me. Hello. Mr. Song often mentions about you. Please call me Yaoyao like him. Yaoyao, nice to see you. We have been working here for a long time. This is your first time here. Let me show you around. Ok Ok Doctor He. Hua. Everyone knows about it. Look. Yaoyao. Please show He Fei around. What happened? Nothing. Let's go to work. Mrs. Song, Song Teng told me that you got married after graduation. My dad always says that Song Teng is one of his best students. You are very lucky. Are you afraid of ghosts? I am a doctor. I believe in natural science. Is there a boy in this house? I heard some noise when I came in. No-. Maybe it's from the next door. Well, Mrs. Song, since you are a doctor, I think you must be interested in a place. Let me take you there. Okay. A lot of things happened in the hospital today. I am a little tired now. It doesn't matter. You go to sleep now since you have to take the morning shift. Yaoyao asked me to move to No. 81. What do you think? It's too far from the hospital. Moreover, it's your work place. I think it's not so good. Move there. Or we may have much time together. Well, forget it. I really want to move there, but the hospital... Got it. It's no big deal. Don't feel down, okay? Go inside. Yaoyao is very happy when she knows you are coming. You should have a drink with her later. Okay. Hmm. You have brought this, haven't you? Yes. Go downstairs and say hello to them. My mother said that an engineering team was going to repair the House No. 81 long time ago, however, a lot of people saw something evil. She said it was a haunted house. Is that true? That engineering team was under the leadership of my father. A lot of weird things happened here that year. After the Cultural Relics Bureau suspended the project, my father quit his job and started his own business. But he can't let it go. He has tried every effort to restart the project this time. Are you alright? I don't know why I'm feeling like I have been here before. In our lifetime, we often have the same kind of feeling. Maybe it's destiny. But everyone says there are some evil spirits guarding this house. Are you... Are you really going to live here? We didn't do anything guilty. What do I have to fear? I have never seen any evil spirits, but, indeed, something terrible once happened here. Here used to be an illustrious general's mansion house, but it was declined overnight because of a baby-missing case that caused a stir in the capital city at that time. The murderer was exactly the former hostess of House No.81, Niu Menghe. In those years, Niu Menghe and Zhang Zhisheng, the young general, were an affectionate couple. However, Zhisheng fell in love with Ji Jincui later, and Niu Menghe became crazy because of jealousy. She killed an infant in order to get pregnant. After her crime was exposed, her husband Zhang Zhisheng sentenced her to death. But afterwards, weird things constantly happened in the house. This dignified mansion house has become a haunted house for many years. What happened? Nothing. It's just the wind. Let's go inside. - Hmm. - Song Teng. We can use fine red bricks here. Yeah. It's a good advice. I have an idea too. Listen to me. I want to make the windows reversible. The new wood materials can be removed if they are not needed in the future. So the original appearance of it will not be damaged. Yeah. Okay. Alright. I am all ears. Alright. I'll write it down. It is as well to know which way the wind blows. You should hand over what don't belong to you. L. will never betray my buddies even if I have to die today. Zhisheng. As for you, you buddies may bring you a disaster. Uncle, I will stay in No. 81 house and never fight for power any more. How about that? You have to hand over your power today. I don't want you to change your mind some day. Today, we have to end it up. Honorable Buddha, Zhisheng is soft hearted and cannot defeat his enemies. I hope he can inherit his father's business, and become powerful by himself. I am willing to give out everything I have to support him and keep my family safe. Right. Words don't carry conviction. How can we trust you? How about you divorcing your wife and marrying Jincui? Then we can be a true family. Madam. I will protect your family. Hush. Ji Chunlong, You want to take them all? Well. You don't think about us, do you? Ah? We have promised that we would divide it equally, haven't we? Soldiers and horses cannot compete with my dear daughter. Zhisheng. Jincui has been loving with you since childhood. Will you marry her? I have got married. I think I cannot do that. I heard that Jincui is really a beauty in the capital city. Now that nobody wants to marry her, I will marry her as my ninth wife. What are you doing? Chunlong. Hold your horses. Why are you here? Put down your gun. Chunlong. My husband treated you well before. Now he has passed away. How can you bully us like this? Alas. Well. You are not his first wife. Right. Is Zhang Zhisheng your natural son? Right. I, Ji Chunlong, only consider Bao Biyu as his wife. She has passed away. What you said doesn't count. Chunlong. My husband once saved your life. If l make the decision today to marry her in, what do you think? Morn. Well, I want to listen to Zhisheng. Well. Enough is enough. You can talk about it another day. Today, we should take over his power. I am sure he will marry her. It's a good chance for us. Nobody can hurt them without my permission. Pooh! Sir, It is because of me. How about that? Zhisheng, we have got married for three years, but I haven't given birth to a child for you. It's unforgivable. You can divorce me because of this and marry another woman. Menghe. Stop that. If you don't do this, I will feel ashamed to stay here. Menghe. Look. He is still pretending. Mr. Ji. After your daughter is married in, I will treat her as my sister. I won't let her feel aggrieved. I hope you can keep your words and keep us safe. Deal. You are such an affectionate woman. If you treat Jincui well after she gets married, I won't ask him to divorce you. You can be another wife of him. Thank you. Good. It's a union of our family. The unrelated people can just leave. Pooh! Let's go. Turn right. Miss. The young general has stepped into Niu Menghe's room. (I have devoted to the traditional Chinese medicine for decades.) (But nowadays the western medicine has become popular.) (I desire to take advantage of them and develop my own style.) (I never expected that...) Did you stayed here overnight? Are you okay? Sinan is not good recently. He has been infected time and time again. His organs become weak. I cannot wait. He Fei. You are just a doctor, not a savior. You have been taking care of him for five years. You have tried your best. Sinan cannot die. You know that. It's an accident. It's not. We would never lose our baby if I were not rescuing him. I don't want to mention it now. But I cannot forget it. I could feel him at that time. I could feel him. You just don't understand. Sorry. Can you keep company by my side tomorrow? I have to go on a business trip for No. 81 house with Lin Yao tomorrow. That house is really important to you, isn't it? It's my representative. Ah. Hua. Ah. Doctor He. It's so late. Are you still working? Yeah. Mr. Song is not here. I have to try my best to repair it. It's not easy for you to make a living alone. My son is three years old. And my daughter is going to have her second birthday next month. You are so young. You even have two children. Look. Adorable. Doctor He. You and Mr. Song will have a more adorable and smarter child in the future. Thank you. I'm leaving. (I once tried to treat a woman.) (I have tried every method, but she still cannot get pregnant.) (So I have to try the secret prescription.) (But it is so evil.) Hua. Hua. Hua. Song Teng. Sorry. I shouldn't ask you to go with me. Never mind. He Fei. You should go home first. What about you? I have to stay here till the last day when I finish all the work here. I won't go. Everything is a mess now. Please don't make me worry about you, okay? I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to stay with you. Is that okay? Why? Or you don't want me to stay here, do you? Fei, are you alright? I'm fine. Really? Sure. Hua's body is going to be checked today. I want to say goodbye to him. Look at you. Your lungs turn black. You shouldn't smoke too many cigarettes. Come in. Doctor He. Have a cup of coffee. I have just made it. It's icy. No.thanks. I wonder what causes his death. Myocardial infarction caused by the clog of his left coronary artery. The blockage of the blood supply area of the anterior descending branch results in an extremely high death rate. Sudden cardiac death. There are a lot of incentives of the heart disease. It may be tiredness, nervousness OI" shock. She's back. You should leave now. Doctor He. Are you okay? I'm fine. Is it because he is a cold-shoulder to you and you don't feel good? Or because of child? This is my own business. Doctor He. I just care about you. I didn't mean to hurt you. I hate you. Doctor He. Sinan. She never leaves you. She is always by your side. She also encourages me to hold on. It's dangerous. Don't run about. Morn. Don't leave me. Ah. Do you hear that? The boy in our hospital lapsed into a deep coma last night. He is now in the ICU. You mean Zhou Sinan in Ward 403? Yeah. It's him. Well, have you notified Doctor He? I can't reach her because her phone is powered off. (The train heading to Dongzhimen is approaching,) Bitch! What's this? Are you pregnant? I am destined to have no kid this life. This is a gift for the child of you and Zhisheng. Bitch! I'm telling you, don't be smug. I will make Zhisheng love me sooner or later. My lady. If you want, I can help you. I don't know what you are talking about. It's so late Please go back. Jincui is barren. If you get pregnant now, everything will be back to you again. It takes the human placenta as the medicine. This used to be a secret prescription for the imperial concubines in the palace to have a baby boy for winning the emperor's favor. But in fact, this prescription is not that good. I have found the best way to extract the medicine. It takes the placenta that wraps an infant in the universe as the medicine. After taking this medicine, you are sure to get a baby boy. Ridiculous! Madam, don't you want to make it up and renew the relationship with your husband? Mr. Wang, should I have to do that? This is something intolerable and injustice. A doctor should treat his patients as their parents do. It's a pity. Is she pregnant? Madam. She feels sick just because she ate too much. God bless you. You are sure to have a baby boy for the Zhangs. We can wait. I am going to find the doctor of my father's mansion house. You have got married with my son. You are a member of our family. How can you turn to the doctor from your father's house? People may laugh at Zhisheng if they know that. Madam. Your second daughter-in-law is different from the first daughter-in-law. She is born into a general family. She was in good health. But now she thinks too much. If she can take good care of herself, I'm sure she will get pregnant soon. Really? What do you prescribe for her? What medicine does she need? Just tell me. We can afford it. Yes. Madam. Doctor Wang. I count on you. You are so kind to accept me. I am sure to do everything I can for you. We must succeed this time. Your sacrifice is worthwhile. Sun up? You go to sleep first. Where is Sinan? Why doesn't he play with me? Where are you going? Sweetie. Come to me. Aren't you afraid that He Fei knows that? She is ridiculous recently. Are you alright? Song Teng. What happened? What's on your mind? I have never been so eager for a baby like now. Maybe we will have another baby soon. I don't want another baby. I just want her. What do you mean? I saw her. Song Teng. It's a girl. She is here. But she dislikes me. So she doesn't want to see me. Hold on. He Fei, listen to me. Our child has disappeared five years ago. No-. She is five years old. She is always with us. She is in this house. Maybe it is because I don't love her enough, I am too careless, so I got the punishment. Enough is enough. I won't have my own baby this life. Stop it! There is no child here. There is! Please wake up! There is! She is here. She calls me mom. Ridiculous! Why do you think so? Why can't you believe me? How can I believe you? Can be just move on like a normal couple? You want to move on, then you go. You can go. You can go find another woman. Move on. You can go for Lin Yao. Nonsense! Ah. Song Teng. Why are you here? Oh. I come to see Sinan. How about him these days? Ah. Maybe we should wait for a miracle. Where is Doctor He? How about her? She is tired. She needs rest. I think she is under great pressure these days. Baby, where are you? Morn. Morn. Morn. Don't be afraid. Mom is coming. Don't be afraid. You don't be afraid. You look like what I imagined. Mom, do you love me? Sure. I love you. I'm sorry. But you love Sinan more, don't you? No. I'm sorry. Never mind. I don't want you feel sorry. Mom will love you more. I will never leave you. Please don't leave me any more. You promise? Yishi Newspaper! The baby-losing case has a clue. Someone reported that the murder is hidden in the mansion house. People are panicky now. You see that? Zhang Zhisheng's soldiers are all in low spirits and down-hearted. Alas. They are just good for nothing. We should take the chance to knock out them. Knock out them! Knock out them! Knock out them! Knock out them! I didn't do it. This is not mine. How can you be so cruel? Take the murder away. Why don't you believe me? I am not the murder. It's lucky that Doctor Wang disclosed it. Or I Will be killed. You should tell the others that she is out of mind. She is not herself. Zhisheng. In summer, kids play the spinning top. In autumn, Three days later, I will invite a master to exorcise the evil spirits for you. If you have something to say, just tell the god. Then you can be kept alive. General. If you don't kill the crazy woman, one day, when her criminal conspiracy is unmasked, do you still want to save the reputation of our family, gain people's respect or your own fame? So what if I don't do that? Our whole family will pay for the lives of the eight infants. I know that. What about me? I have already had your baby. My lady. Are you okay? Why did you set me up? Those quacks cannot make it. In this world, only I can turn bad into good. You are so evil. My lady, if you listened to me that time, and let me have a try, you wouldn't have lived such a miserable life. Even if I have no children this life, I won't do it by killing another baby. Niu Menghe. You are right. I have got pregnant. If you listened to Doctor Wang, I wouldn't have the chance. It's you who killed those babies. How can you be so cruel? Doctor Wang is a genius. If it weren't for him, I would never get pregnant. Well, it's you who gave me such a good chance to show my ability. I want to see Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhang Zhisheng. Do you think he wants to see you? Don't forget that everyone thinks that it's you who killed those babies, boiled and ate them. Why are you here? I am coming here to tell you I want this baby, so does Zhisheng. Do you think that Zhisheng really doesn't care about that? You never know how much he loves his children. I can kill eight babies for him, so I am the only one who can live with him for a whole life, but not you. You can think that I owe you this life. Please let Zhisheng and my child go. Let go my whole family. You can think that you change your own life for Zhisheng's son. Okay? What do you want me to do? Tomorrow they will exorcise for you. For Zhisheng, I want you to really go mad. Alright. But I want you to promise that you won't kill any babies and you should be kind to those victims. Deal. Dad. I will try my best to ask for the Cultural Relics Bureau. I will make it. Bye. Mrs. Song, what brings you here? You asked me if I believe that there are ghosts in the world. Do you believe reincarnation? Why are you talking about this? You are Ji Jincui. You took away Zhang Zhisheng in the previous life, and now you are even trying to take Song Teng away from me. I don't know what you're talking about. Indeed, I admire him, and I understand how he feels when his talents remain unrecognized. I know something wrong happened to you two. Although I admire him, I don't want to take him away from you. Slut! It's you who killed the baby for your own good, and then you set me up. You are the murderer! Song Teng said that you're not feeling well recently. It seems to be true. He said he would take care of you, so he gave up on House No.81. He has resigned. He has given up everything because of you. Don't you know anything about that? How could you say you love him? You are a murderer. If you really cannot recall it, I can tell you the truth. Mrs. Song, I'm telling you, over all these years, you have been standing in his way. With you, he has not been acting like a man, and he even has no chance to be a father. Nonsense! Just let him go. You killed someone. It is all your fault. Song Teng. It's not her. It's not her. She is forced to do so. Who is she? Niu Menghe. Hostess of the house. Niu Menghe didn't kill people. She is not the murder. She is wronged. He Fei. Song Teng. Trust me. I trust you. She doesn't leave here. She is always here. You are psycho. You are psycho. Are you silly? You are psycho. I am the general's wife. It's no big deal to kill several babies. Go to the mansion house to catch her. Don't let her go. Go! Mr. Zhang. Kill her for those babies. It's right and proper. When your father was alive, he said that military orders must be obeyed. How can you behave like this now? General. Come out. Lu Shaoming blows the coals and the crowd gets furious. If we don't shoot now, it will be out of control. If we shoot to the public, what's the difference between me and Mr. Lu? General. If we don't hand her out, they will never let it go. In summer, kids play the spinning top. In autumn, kids play the diabolo. Do you have any last words? You hear that? What are you doing? Zhisheng. You killed those kids. How can you do this? Shot me! I'd rather you kill me! Morn. I am sorry. I'm late. It doesn't matter. In summer, kids play the spinning top. In autumn, kids play diabolo. In winter, kids kick shuttlecocks. In the early spring, kids play games. In summer, kids play the spinning top. In autumn, kids play diabolo. No one saw her in the hospital. She didn't come back. Is she not at No. 81 house? She is not there. Where on earth did she go? What have you done to Doctor He? Who is he? Why didn't you treat her well? What are you doing? Let go! Do you know how much time and energy have she consumed for the kid? Who are you? She is a good doctor. In this world, only we know each other's feelings. You don't understand it. I'm going to find her. Ah. Do you know where she is? She is looking for her child. Child. She has no child. She is always looking for her child. She has been five years old and is always by our side. Why don't you trust me? Bro., officers from the cultural relics bureau are coming. The survey report shows that there is a lot of bio gas here. Mr. Song. The Bureau has decided to close up the house. Please leave here before daybreak tomorrow morning. Hold on. Can you give me a little more time? Sorry. We must ensure that everyone is safe. This is the official letter. Bro., you don't need to worry about it. My dad has known it yesterday. This is my boyfriend Raymond. Mr. Song, how do you do? How do you do? I will go back to America with Raymond tomorrow. Well. He Fei came to me that day. I've told her a lot what I shouldn't say. In case something happens to her... Never mind. Actually we have some problems. It's me who don't want to face them. You can go now. I want to stay alone. If you need me, I can... I want to... It doesn't matter. No more words. I trust you. Let's go. "Menghe Niu, the women of jealousy Why she became a baby killer" It's dead. What' s wrong? I am a quack. My baby. Zhisheng. You should take good care of yourself in the future. Menghe. Menghe. I am willing to do anything for you. I am not afraid of you. Come out. You. I know it's you. Go away. You forced me to do it. You should die. You forced me. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. Zhisheng. He Fei, where are you? Zhisheng. He Fei. Is that you? Mom. Morn. Don't sleep. Morn. Morn. Mom. Morn. Don't sleep. Sinan needs you. Morn. Don't sleep. Wake up. Morn. He Fei. Song Teng. Let's go. - Wait. - Hurry. Come. Come here. Who is this little girl? She is our daughter. Really? Let's go now. Song Teng. Zhisheng. Forgive me, please. I just want to see you once again. You finally come to me. I have been waiting here for you for so long a time. Do you know that? I am not the person whom you want to see. Let them go. Why are you afraid of me? It's because of her. Song Teng. Menghe. Zhang Zhisheng killed all people after your death. He went mad. Song Teng. Menghe. It's me. Zhisheng. I only trusted what I saw before, and almost hurt the person I love most. The moon can be the highest and brightest. A couple can be the closest but the furthest. Niu Menghe. Zhisheng. Although I am not the person you want to find, but I know that he should say sorry to you. He Fei. Song Teng. It's a pity that he never trusted me. She is really miserable. She has been trapping here for so long a time. Let's leave here. Go with me. Baby. Dad, mom, I'm sorry. I cannot go with you. No. you should go with us. Mom. I love you. So please forget me. No-. Thank you. No, honey. - No. - He Fei. He Fei. Let's go. She lives in our heart forever. - No. - Let's go. Song Teng. Song Teng. Have they appeared in your mind recently? You mean it was our illusion that night because we had inhaled a lot of bio gas generated by medicines? Do you feel it real? Of course. Maybe there is someone who wants to remind us to cherish each other. People always believe in what they want to believe. Optimistic people see the hope. Pessimistic ones see no hope. Actually, I am pessimistic. It's him who gives me hope. I have dealt with a lot of cases like yours. Whatever there are ghosts in the world, I just know one thing, when you encounter some difficulties, you will always overcome them if you have the support from your family. God bless you. You are coming! Shanna. Do you come here to see Sinan? Wow! It's so big. Stop that. Just once. Let's go. Go. Good. Hi. Doctor He. Long time no see. He should call me aunt. Okay.
