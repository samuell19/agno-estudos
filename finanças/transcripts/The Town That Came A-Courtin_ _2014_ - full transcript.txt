I'm a lucky woman. I've been blessed. New York Times best seller list, spots on all the big talk shows. Even a Hollywood movie based on one of my books. I'm so grateful for all the adventures my career has created. Almost all. Turns out, life's not only stranger than fiction, it's harder to get right. You can't delete pages out of your life, or go back and revise endings. You just have to be open to writing that next chapter. I see the next chapter of my life so clearly, Abby. Now that you're finally here with me. - You're a gracious host. Tell me about yourself. I've read every one of your books at least three times. Now that's still talking about me. Tell me about yourself. I was born on a rainy day. My mother always told me that. And I was three days late. Now this fella's story is complex. Mine is simple. Lucky in everything, but love. But maybe we should start back a bit further, say, a week. Abigail Houston, this is no time to be leaving town! - Mom, my book tour has been scheduled for months, I'm not changing it. - There aren't many things more important in this world than your work, but my hand to heaven this is one of them. - Momma, people pay good money for my books, I promised I would come see them. What is more important than me honoring my word? - Steve Marshall's divorce. - Excuse me? - Yeah, I know! It's so exciting! I couldn't quite believe it myself when I first heard, then I thought about that shrill, scrawny girl he threw you over for. - I broke up with him, thank you very much! - Well, if that's how you wanna remember. The fact is, she was no prize and he finally came to his senses. Now you two can be happy again like you used to be! - In high school. - I know. Look at how the Good Lord rewards patience! - Momma, I have not been waiting for Steve Marshall. - If you don't snatch him up quick, some less deserving spinster will. - Spinster! What high-button shoe did you get that one out of? - Well, pardon me, Missy! I suppose you would prefer "divorcee". - Well, I'd prefer... Steve! - My words exac... - Miss Lizzy Beth, and Abby, what a pleasure! It's been a while. Hi Kazoo! - Well, Steve Marshall! We were just talking about-- - About how nice the flower shop looks, that was just wonderful of your bank to give Arlene that loan. - We invest in our neighbors. - People we've known all our lives often turn out to be our greatest treasures, wouldn't you agree, Steve? - Common history is pretty sweet. - Well, some people need to broaden their horizons and go out in the world and see what's out there. - So you heard about Peggy. - Oh, no, no, that's-- - She left me flat, moved to Chicago to be a yoga teacher. - Oh, I'm so sorry, Steve. - Abby knows first hand the pain of a wandering spouse. You two should have coffee, swap war stories! - Oh, I'd like that. - Well, actually, I'm on the way to start a book tour. - Of course, congratulations on your new book. - Thank you, but well maybe when I get back? - You'll give me a call? - I surely will. - I know you will. Hi. Thank you. - We're gonna lose our dinner reservation. - This is more important. - Oh, we have a policy, so just... - Who would you like me to inscribe it to? - To uh, Wal, Walter. Okay, we have a long drive, tomorrow, all the way to Happyville, Happy Valley, you know, wherever. - It's Bliss, Mississippi. - To my mother, Cordelia. - Okay, I must be insane, letting you drive us all the way to some wide spot in the middle of the road. - The owner of the bookstore there is a very dear friend of mine. - To my sister, Portia. My time is very dear to me. - Susan-Marie is a leader in the independent bookstore community, and she was one of my very first fans. I owe her so much, I told her I would do a signing in Bliss and I keep my promises. - I was one of your first fans. - Thank you so much, dear! - To my sister, Rosalind. - Is your mother a Shakespearean scholar, Walter? I'm just, I was noting, not mocking. - Hey, hey, can I get a picture? - Of course! You know, if I were to calculate what I brought into the publishing house that we both call home... - Fine, play the bestseller card. Onward and upward to Bliss we go! - You won't regret it. Thank you! - We'll get it to you, don't worry. Hi! Thank you so much for coming. - I see so much of myself in her books. - She's here! Just passed me on Wisteria! - She's even prettier than her picture! - Other one's looking pretty grim. Hope she's not a troublemaker. - Yes! She's here. But she brought someone with her who's already in trouble with Deputy Ricky. Mm-mmm-hmmm! - Oh, isn't it beautiful? - No bars is not beautiful. - Oh, stop. - Welcome, Abby! Well hi, lovely morning. - Welcome, Jamie! Hello. - The prayer chain called and told me you'd arrived. - Excuse me? - That's our town telephone tree, and spy network. I'm Charlotte! Oh, you sweethearts. - Oh, it's such a pleasure to be here. - Oh, I'm honored to have you. - Do you have Wi-Fi? - I do hope we get a chance to talk a bit while you're here. I'm dying to know what your next book's about. - Oh, Abby can't be talking about that until the book's finished. - That strikes me as being Abby's choice. - Well, it was such a long drive, maybe we can freshen up and then we could talk. - Of course. Right this way! - Is there someone who can get our luggage? Charlie! - What's she doing here? Where's the display for my book club charity drive? - Lorraine, I told you I had to leave space for Abby Houston. - Why can't she have the back? - Because she's our honored guest! - And I am the president of the Chamber of Commerce. I have a say here! - You do not! You have a say in Chamber business and your boutique, but this is my bookstore, my decisions. - Oh. Mayor! Did you see this? Yep! Folks'll be coming from all over the county. I bet business all across town goes up. You and the Chamber must be so excited. But of course you're not. Susan-Marie! I want my charity drive book back here in the center where it belongs, and I'm not going to have any ifs, ands or buts about it. - Susan-Marie! Oh, Abby! Hi! - We're not done here. - Oh, never you mind Lorraine. Oh, Jamie, it's such a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. Uh, have the books arrived? - They're back there. Would you like to check on them? - Oh, you have a lovely store! I can't believe you're finally here! Oh, wait until you see it all decorated for your signing. I've got people baking and bringing flowers. We're all so thrilled! - Bars! Finally! - You can't use your phone in here, it's against the rules. - Okay, this is the only place in the entire town my phone works, so... - It's still against the rules. - Oh. Alright. Here you go. - I don't want your money, I want your phone. I feel more relaxed here than I don't know when, and everybody is so nice! Susan-Marie... - I am not giving her my phone. - She won't give me her phone! - Betsy, you have to understand they're out-of-towners! - Jamie, you have to take a break! - Ladies, is there a problem here? You know how much I love solving problems. - We're fine, Charlie, just a little misunderstanding. - Abby. - Yes? Jamie. I'm Charlie. - Our State Senator. - Oh, more importantly you're Charlotte's husband, am I correct? - At your service. She dispatched me to make sure you get a proper tour. - Could you tell me where I can find some decent cell reception in this town? - I know all the secret spots. - Oh, a friend, at last! - Bye! - What was that? - I don't want you being rude! - So the original library stood there? - Until the fire of 1943, when we rebuilt closer to the park. Oh, that's trouble. When those two put their heads together, nothing good ever comes of it. - Yeah, she seems rather put out about my being here. - Lorraine just likes being the center of attention whether she deserves it or not. - Senator! - Mayor! - Hi! - Well maybe I should invite Lorraine for some tea? Not why you're here! Oh! - Oh! Jamie! Are you alright? - She is just fine! What about my poor Elmer? Well, it was just an accident, Elmer looks fine, don't you sweetheart? - Reel him in, will ya? - First of all, Elmer is a lady. And second, your ridiculous shoes are the reason for your lack of balance, not my Elmer. So you reel yourself in! - Abby, Jamie, I apologize. Miss Eula is our resident crank. - Well, what's her story, Charlie? - I don't like her. - There seems to be a sadness to her. - Well, truth be told, she is kinda sad, I forgot, but it's... Afternoon, ladies! Oh now, I know none of y'all could be giggling over me. You must want to meet our special guest. - Hi, I'm Abby Houston. - Welcome to Bliss. - You being here is the most exciting thing in years! - Well, I'm flattered. Y'all coming to the signing tomorrow? - Absolutely, we wouldn't miss it! - There's something else we have to ask you about that can't wait. - Something you can do while you're here in Bliss, that will make such a difference on the entire town. - Does this have anything to do with Lorraine's charity drive? - Heaven's no, we want you to meet our mayor. - He needs a wife. - Uh... - Y'all run along now! None of this foolishness, go along. - Bye, bye. Bye. - I am so sorry, I can't imagine who put them up to that. - Probably my momma. - Fans will say anything to get Abby's attention. Next they'll probably want you to run for Mayor. - They probably just thought they were being funny. I'm sure Mayor Alexander is innocent in all of this. - Well, I would hope so. - But I must say, he's a fine man. Well, I hate to leave you ladies, but I'm running late for a business dinner. - No, no, you can't go, you still need to show me where I can get good cell reception. And not get in trouble for it! - I can take you there on the way. - Thank you. - Alright, well you two go on, I'm just gonna wander. - Have your iPad ready, in case you get inspired. - It's right here. Alright, honey, where do I start? - Am I the only one having one of Gemma's cupcakes? Don't worry, I ordered a whole batch for the event! - They'll probably be gone before I get there. - Just as well, better for my diet. - What do you mean, "Before you get there?" - We're going to the book signing first. You really should come, Lorraine. - She's right, start your event later, no one will mind. - I'll mind! - Yes dear, but then, you always do. - We met Abby Houston this morning, and she is the sweetest thing. - And beautiful. We just saw her on the street walking with Charlie. - We walked right up to her and told her she should marry the mayor! - We walked right up to her. - That's a terrible idea. - Lorraine, we're just saying-- - That he's incapable of finding a proper date here in Bliss? - Here we go again. - We were so happy together. - For two weeks. The summer before we went away to college! - Lorraine, you gotta move on! - And you need to get to my event on time! - I'll be right back with the sweet tea. Make yourself at home. - Thank you. - Hey, how are ya? Good to see you, Chuck. Hey Jim. I told you the Rebels would win! Do you wanna talk about this now? - Oh, woah. Spencer! Since when you comin' in here at dinnertime? - There's guys to see, and people to... - Mmm-mmm, you better get home before Mary-Ellen has your hide for spoiling her beautiful meal. - I will.. - Mmhmm! - This is Jamie? - Jamie, this is Abby's momma. How are you this evening, dear? - Fine, thank you ma'am, how are you? Oh, so lonely for my daughter. I suppose she's getting along just fine without me. - Yes, I'm making sure she's eating her vegetables and brushing her teeth. - Is she meeting any men? - No, no, but you know that's not really built into our timetable. Now, Jamie dear, you should reset your timetable. You're single too, aren't you? - Miss Lizzy Beth! - There's nothing wrong with being single. - Oh, why thank you. - But you can't make a habit of it. My cousin Gregory's youngest boy wound up in New York, though we prayed for him to get a job in Atlanta. You know, I don't know why it never occurred to me until right now that you two would get along right fine. I should give him a call. - Oh, no, no, you don't need to do that. Really, no, no. - It's a joy to help people we love find happiness. That's why I need to talk to Abby. Well, she's not here. - Well, when she gets back you tell her to give me a call. It's about Steve Marshall. - Oh, I heard about Steve. Isn't Abby lucky to have you looking after things back home. - Well, I'd do anything for my girl. I'm sure your momma is the same. Oh, maybe I should call your momma direct, tell her about Greg Junior. - No thank you, uh, no thank you. No, no, I'll tell her myself, and I'll also tell Abby that you called. Alright, great, thank you, good night! Jamie! Get back here, young man! - Ho, ho, ho, ho, what, what happened? - Kyle Edwards, you come back here and apologize! - Miss Eula, you cannot bring Elmer in my diner! - Spencer, you tell that boy to apologize this instant. - I didn't do anything, dad. - You, you nearly ran over Elmer with that skate-do-lally thing of yours! They should be outlawed. Well, Spencer? Are you gonna do the right thing? - Yes, ma'am. I'm gonna buy you a piece of peach cobbler. There's nothing like Maggie's peach cobbler to lighten the heart. Maybe even a scoop of ice cream, as long as your sugars aren't troubling you these days. - You think you can buy me off so cheaply, young man? - Never. Just thought I could bring you a little happiness. - I'm not interested in happiness, I want justice! And it's clear that I'm not going to find it in here. If not for excuses and gooses, we'd all have a happy Thanksgiving. - You get. Thank you, Spencer. I best be getting on home before anything else happens. Don't you worry about it, Miss Eula just loves to express herself. She's tougher than a two dollar steak, grumpy as a mule munching on bumblebees. Oh, I hope you enjoyed your first meal in Bliss! - Oh, it was marvelous, I'm just sorry I missed the peach cobbler. Spencer! - Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry - Oh I'm fine, I'm fine. - Oh you are not, you are bleeding! And your pedicure... Oh my land, what you must have paid for those shoes. - I'm very sorry, I didn't realize... - It was just an accident, I'm okay. - I love your nail polish, what's left of it. - I'm such a clad. - Oh, no you're not. - Oh he is, redeem yourself Spencer. Be a gentleman and walk her to her car. - Of course, where are you parked? - I walked. - From the Magnolia Blossom, in those heels? Aren't you brave? - Or stupid. - Yeah, I was being polite. Don't worry, Spencer will take good care of you. - My car's right out front, I am so sorry. Let me walk you up. Oh no, you've done enough already, thank you. - Caused enough, you mean. - Well, I think I can find it in my heart to forgive you. - I'm glad your heart is good, did you ask your foot? - Good night, Spencer. Thank you. Leave you alone for two seconds?! - And I met the man of my dreams. Seriously? - Seriously. It was awful. - How awful? His name is Spencer Edwards. He's handsome, smart, funny... He's got eyes you could swim in. - Still waiting for the awful. - He's married. - I'll scoop, you talk. - It's a long story. Okay... Jamie told me you had called, but I was out late last night. - Why, what were you doing? - I went to dinner in town, how's things there? - I had lunch with Steve. I do believe that boy never got over you. Which is just wonderful. - No, it's not. Well, it gives you a head start on all those other girls who have also taken notice of his change in availability. - An available man and an interesting man are two very different things. - Meaning? - Meaning I need to go, give Kazoo a kiss for me. I will. - So you're sure you're okay with going straight from the rotary lunch into the book signing? - Yes, I will time my adrenaline and caffeine accordingly. Oh my goodness, let's give you a hand. - Oh, no, I'm fine, sugar. Oh they're gorgeous. - Oh yeah, well I'm glad you like them, they're yours. From Mayor Alexander! - Oh my, that is very thoughtful, and unnecessary. - Guess there's no stopping destiny. - Oh, hush! - Destiny? - Some of your friends and neighbors stopped Abby on the street to tell her that her and the mayor are a match made in heaven. - Oh, oh, oh, oh you absolutely are. Oh why, you two would go together like... - Horseradish and pecan pie? - Now don't judge him 'till you know him! - Oh, well sadly Abby's not going to have time to get to know him, you know... - Why? - Books to sign, speeches to give, you know. - Alright. - Thank you so much! - Okay, goodbye. Bye! Saved you on that one. And don't you know, that's exactly what happened. Which just goes to show that a southern gentleman knows there's no sneaking in late without apologizing first to the hostess. Isn't that right, gentleman? So, let me conclude by saying thank you for the opportunity to tell you about all my adventures, and about my new book of course. Please tell everyone you know, if not for me, for my poor widowed mother's sake. She's so upset about me being single and what that says about her worth and success as a mother that she needs something to distract her. Like watching my book climb up the bestseller charts! Thank you, God bless you all! - That was the finest speech I have ever heard. You have a gift. - Yeah. - Thank you so much. - We wanted to apologize for saying you had to marry the mayor. - Oh, that's fine. - You just have to go out with him! - Ladies, that's a fantastic idea. - Dear boy, he spends all his time caring for others. He just needs a little bit of happiness. - Oh, I'm sure he does, and I'm just so flattered that you all compliment me that way, but I just don't think I'm here long enough. - Long enough for one date! Yeah! - Alright, I'll see you at the signing, bye. - Bye. - Ashley, Jamie. You haven't closed your next issue, have you? I've got a great story idea for you. - That is a terrible idea. - Oh come on, it's sweet. Big time author on a date with a small-town mayor because the people begged her to. You could wind up on the cover of multiple magazines! - I am not gonna use a poor mayor to sell books. - Oh right, because fawning over a married man is a much better use of your time. - Hush! I'm already unlucky in love, let's not make it any worse. Come on. Abby, everyone. Hi, thank you, Abby. Thank you for coming, Abby. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Hi. - Thank you, Miss Houston. Hi. Hi. Oh Miss Houston, I am such a fan! - Hi. - Where is everyone? - Over at Susan-Marie's with that ridiculous writer woman and her squinty-eyed friend. - Everyone, Mayor Alexander too? - Oh, we don't need any of them, especially that worthless mayor! - He is a wonderful man. - Oh, don't be a foolish girl, Lorraine, focus on what matters. What gives live meaning and purpose. - Other than him? - Oh, you have not got the sense God gave a fly. Let me explain a thing or two. - Thank you. - If you go out with our mayor, you'll be happy you did. - I'll keep that in mind, thanks. - Thank you. - The mayor really is awfully cute. I mean, for an older man. - Well, that's a new perspective, Betsy. - I mean my mom, she stares at him in church all the time when she thinks no one's looking. - Well I bet she'd be mighty proud that you shared that with me. - I'm not gonna tell you to date the mayor. - Oh, well you're the first, thank you very much. - A fine woman like you just... Hey how you doing, good to see ya. Hey, how are ya? - There he is, hello baby. - Nice to see you. Hello. - Alright, Abby's only gonna have time to sign the new book today. So if you want the older books signed, you'll just have to get back in line and uh... - But she already, it wasn't... Alright, this way. Okay thank you so much. - Haven't seen a crowd like this since the basketball coach from Old Miss came 10 years ago. - Well that's high praise but if you want me to sign a book you'll have to get back in line. - No, I'm not here for a book. - Well that's no way to an author's heart. - I'm here on serious business. I need to check your foot. - Oh, well I think we can save most of the toes. - Well, that's good. I hear you've got important business still to do. - Oh no, I'm all done after signing. - Well that's funny, I could have sworn I heard you were going to go out with the mayor. - Oh, well, the rumors of my social life have been greatly exaggerated. Thank you! - Well, that's too bad. - Really? - I know for a fact that he would have loved to go out with you. - Oh, well I'm flattered. - So if he asks you, would you go out with him? - With a man who needs a whole town to get him a date? I think not. Hi. - Now that is too bad. - Really? Thank you. - 'Cause I'm the mayor. - He's the mayor? - Was, for 16 years, so people still call him mayor, but I took over five years ago. - But your last name's Edwards. - Oh, Kyle Edwards? That's my son's middle name, to differentiate from his uncle, Kyle Jackson Alexander. We are the Alexanders. - But you're married. - Widower. - Oh, I'm very sorry. - Thank you. - Uh, but Mary-Ellen? - My daughter. She's an 11 year old firecracker! And an excellent cook. My wife, uh, passed away three years ago now. I think my neighbors are a tad overeager to get me dating again. I should apologize, but... - But? - But I kinda like the idea. So does Abby. So it looks like it's gonna be my first date. - Are you kidding? - I thought you'd be pleased. - Are you kidding, it's embarrassing. - You're always saying I need to go out and do things. With your friends, dad. With this there'll be press, and photos! And look at you, you haven't bought a new shirt in I don't know how long. - What's wrong with my shirt? It does not belong in People magazine. - Neither do I. - Exactly. - And what do you know about this woman? They're using you, dad, this whole thing's undignified. - Well, this from a guy who insisted I dress up as a clown for the Fourth of July parade. Coming! - That's different, you want people to laugh at you in a parade. - People laughed at me? Oh, did I keep you waiting, Lorraine? - You said "come in". - Pretty sure I didn't. - I brought Mary-Ellen some of my homemade blackberry vinaigrette I promised her. - Pretty sure you didn't. - Thanks for coming by, Lorraine, sorry you can't stay. - Of course I can! You know, I am surprised to find you at home, Spencer. I heard you were going out with that writer. - Is that the sound of laughter? - Good night, Lorraine. - Oh, I can stay with the children if you're going out. - I am not going out tonight. - Okay then. - I'm going out tomorrow. - I think I look quite nice. - It's just that that outfit doesn't scream "front page picture". - Good. I think it should murmur "How did I get myself into this?" - Hey, come on, lunch with a gorgeous man while getting some solid publicity? Win, win. - It feels more like a business transaction than a date. - Hey, Snow White and Prince Charming started off with CPR. Just saying. - Oh, you look lovely. These are from the mayor. - Oh, Mayor Spencer Alexander? - Yes, that mayor. - Now that's a little more reasonable than that behemoth bouquet that's downstairs. - Speaking of which, come along. Come on, come on! - Good grief, it looks like a florist exploded in here! - Are these all for me? - All from Spencer! - Charlotte, why don't I believe you? - Because it's not true. - I'm relieved, but confused. - Well, the roses are actually from Gail and Pam, they own the florist shop, and the Chrysanthemums are from the city council. Oh, the chocolates, are from Mark and Claudia at the inn. And the balloons and the teddy bear... Well they're from the school board. Let's see, the wine is from-- - But all the cards have his name. - Folks are worried. Spencer's a bit rusty on his courting. - Courting? - It's a lovely word. Go on Charlotte. - Well, Spencer married his high school sweetheart, and he hasn't dated since she died. Although, a few local ladies have tried their darnedest. Have you met Lorraine? - Cupcake femme? - Yes I have. - Well, everyone is just, well, they're trying to help Spencer put his best foot forward! - That's thoughtful. - Not the word I would choose. - Which is why I'm grateful I spoke first. Don't worry Charlotte, I think lunch is gonna be just fine. - Oh, you sweet thing, thank you for forgiving us. - Alright, yes, so romantic, two shots, some close-ups, work with them. We're not even here, we're not even here! Work it, work it. Good, nice, work with them. Good. Alright, let's go. - Salad. Huh, salad... Ah... Some fresh ground pepper for your book... Salad, I mean salad! Yeah, don't mind if I do. Oh, I'm sorry. - Okay. Mayor Alexander, I'm so sorry. - I'm fine, I'm fine. Uh, thank you. Enjoy the salad. - Why does it seem like I'm the least nervous person in town? - I am so sorry, we're not used to having celebrities. And then I'm not used to uh... - I don't do this much either. - Oh. - And I don't think of myself as a celebrity. - Well, we do. Other than a few of us who played at Old Miss... - Oh, did you play football? - I did... I was no Eli Manning, but uh... - Well, tell me about that. - Um, well I... Oh! It's okay. - Dab it, dab it, dab it, dab it! Dry everything, dry it and bring it out back. - I don't think it got into the salad! No, please, please stop. Don't, don't, thank you. - It's okay. I haven't had such an awkward date since Gene Kelleher tried to share my swing in the second grade. - Oh, that stinks, you know I actually thought you two were gonna hit it off. - I kinda did too... I know. Oh! - Abby, Jamie. You know the ladies of the prayer chain. - Aren't you the ones who got her in this mess in the first place? - Well, "mess" might be an overstatement. - Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that! - We're here to tell you, you need to give the mayor another chance. - Mayor, we need a moment. - Hmmm-mmm. - Right now. - What's wrong? You gotta try again, Spencer. - That's right. - That's it. - Uh, try what? - Well, your date, with Abby! - Yeah. - Yeah. She's just not used to a true Southern Gentleman. - Exactly. - That's right. - She's from Georgia, boys. - He's just a little rusty! It'll come back to him! Yes. - She was probably intimidated. - Yeah. - By me dumping water on her? - You're just fancier than he's used to. - Hmmm-mmm, much fancier. - Well, he's not exactly what I'm used to either. - It's not like you, not to fight for something special. - Exactly. - Yeah! - It has to be special on both sides. - But what if it's meant to be? - You'd be a fool to let her go. - You would. - Yes, you would. Yeah, listen to us. - What if... Hmmm-mmm. Enjoy! Thank you. - Here we go! Ssshhtt... She just walked past me. - Looking calm, walking tall. - Ahem. Thanks for meeting me. - Well, it was presented to me as a matter of national security, or almost. - I don't know why my constituents are acting so crazy. - I do, you're smart, and accomplished, and funny, and they just want what's best for you. - Well, they seem to think that includes you. - Well, they are more expert on the subject of Mayor Spencer Alexander, so I'm tempted to agree with them. How much would it mean to you? - More than I could say. I sure would appreciate another chance. - Uh, I would... Why are you two talking? I thought you said the date was a disaster. - I raised you better than this! - We're just worried. - They're using you, dad. I mean, someone has to stand up for the dignity of this family. - By showing the entire town and a special guest that you have no manners? - At least I have some pride! - Sorry, Miss Houston. This isn't a good time to see my father. - Well that's fine, I'm actually here to see you and your brother. Dad! - Kyle Edwards, Mary Ellen, I'd like to apologize for disrupting your family. I know how chaotic things have been for your dad, so I can only imagine what it's been like for the two of you. So, even though I'd love to share another meal with your father and get to know him better, he seems like a wonderful man, I'm gonna leave y'all to your lives, and I hope you can forgive me and your dad for all this ruckus. - What we're all skipping over right now is that nobody forced me to ask Abby out I wanted to do it. And I'd like to ask her out again, maybe make a little less of a klutz of myself. - I thought you were charming. - Miss Houston. I want to apologize for the way I spoke to you and thanks for coming and clearing things up. - And thank you for hearing me out. - So would seven o'clock be a good time for daddy to pick you up for dinner? - Tonight? - Well, I'll be ready if he will be. - He's got a second chance, let's make it count! Woo! - I've spoken to Tony and the menu is set. - The media have been alerted. - Decorations will be ready! - Security is good to go. - Citizen committee is on schedule, mmhmm! - Excellent. - I've got some regional press coming and a couple of free-lance photographers with national connections. No more press. I bet we do another signing of your book before this is over. - Stop! This isn't about my book. This is about me having dinner with a nice man, a father to two sweet children. End of story. - I have no idea what that was all about. - Oh I do, I'll go help. - Okay, come here. Can you just get low, just get this flower. - Scary, isn't it? It's gorgeous. - Right, the town is beautiful, he's handsome and everybody is so excited for you both. Scary, isn't it. - I just don't have the best track record in love. I don't want to fail quite so publicly. Or hurt Spencer. - What if you don't hurt him? What if you're the best thing that ever happened to him, and vice versa? - Now that is scary. - Only if you believe you're gonna fail. If you believe you're going to succeed, then it's exciting! - I suppose so. - Right, okay, good. So, if you can't quite believe in him, or yourself yet, believe in me, and trust me when i tell you it's going to be wonderful. Especially after we do a little shopping. - I surrender. Great, come on, let's go. Alright, I can get them to open any shop in town. You can? Well my husband is the Senator, you know. Oh I know. - I don't get this town, you know. - Well, what's to get? - I'm just... I'm just not used to people asking how you're doing and, you know, really wanting an answer. Or like looking you in the eye and smiling as they pass you on the street. You know, I'm just waiting for y'all to crack up and go "gotcha". - But this is who we are. - Well, I get that now, but... You know, it's just, it's crazy. - No honey, it's Bliss. - Oh that's what that is. - Good evening, Jamie. Charlotte. - Spencer, you look wonderful. Oh, I'll get-- No need! Evening, Spencer. - Good evening, Abby. - Night. - Thank you, ladies. Don't wait up. - Oh, wow! - Wow! So beautiful. - It is pretty sweet. - Reminds me of senior prom. - I didn't go to mine. - Doesn't surprise me a bit. - Wait, what? - Have you had these crab cakes? I think my taste buds are gonna die of happiness. - Hmmm, mmm! Have I told you how much... - Oh, compliments of the school board. And best wishes from the zoning commission. No just, no wait wait wait! Come on! Sorry about him. - No, it's alright. Just please leave them, alright? You don't have to open them. Please. You know, here we are, having a nice quiet dinner at their request, getting to know each other, at their request, and... - I've left it on because of the kids. - Go ahead, go ahead. Oh... Hello? I'm doing just fine. As you can see from where you're sitting. Bye now. Really? - You don't have to apologize, I know how crazy they are about you. But you have to answer me two questions. - Anything. - Are you having as much fun as I am? - More. - Are you through with your dinner? - I am. - Then allow me. Ahem. You are, without a doubt, the most amazing group of people it has ever been my pleasure to meet. And I thank you for your insistence that Mayor Alexander and I have dinner together. I hope you take it as proof of your great instincts, and his true charm, that we are now leaving together, and y'all are staying right here, please. How did you become mayor? - I love this town. My family's been here for generations and I wanted to stay in the kind of place where families could stay and be happy for a long, long time. - Oh, tell me that you have concerts here in the summer. - With varying degrees of success. The chamber orchestra and the jazz combo are always good. But some of the garage bands should maybe stay in their garages. - Oh, so is Bliss where Santa's elves live in the off-season? - I thought we might want a quieter place for dessert, so I asked Mag to set this up, and I asked her to bake one of her famous chocolate bourbon pies. That is assuming that you eat dessert. - Oh, well, never trust a woman who doesn't eat dessert. - Well, I'm certainly glad that Susan-Marie loved my books. - I'm gonna send her a thank you note first thing tomorrow. What now?! - Sorry, oh, sorry! Sorry! - Ricky, what on earth?! - Mayor Alexander, sir, I am so sorry. I was trying to come up real quiet back there but I hit the wrong uh... - Deputy, is there a problem? - Uh yes sir, uh yes there is. Um, you left the restaurant before um this was delivered. And everyone insisted that you needed it. So they told me to bring it to ya, right away. - Well, that is so very nice of them, and of you, too, so thank you very much. My pleasure, ma'am. I sure do hope you're enjoying your time here in Bliss. - Oh, it's like nowhere else on earth. I agree, ma'am! Not that I've been many places, but it's just... - Deputy... - Sir? - Good night. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. - Where were we? - Uh, you were about to find out that I only know one dance step. - Maybe a little champagne will inspire us to create a new one. I'll take that dare. Do you think Deputy Ricky's gonna get in trouble for speeding tonight? Or maybe he's the only one on duty? Spencer? Spencer, is everything, is everyone alright? - I'm very sorry, Abby. But I have to take you back to Charlotte's. - But... You can tell me. - I don't think I can. - This isn't fair. - I know. - Whatever it is, we can talk-- - No, we can't. Abby! Honey, what happened? - What always happens. We'll be checking out first thing in the morning. Good night, Charlotte. What do you mean? - You were right. - That's not good. - We're leaving first thing in the morning. - Wanna talk about it? I don't want to talk about it. - We're not asking for details, I just want to know if it was wonderful and romantic. - No, I will not discuss this with the two of you, or anyone else for that matter. - Like you'd ever let us get away with that. - I beg your pardon? - You always make us tell you everything we do. Even if it's stuff we really don't want to talk about. Share, get it out, talk it through, you'll feel better. How is that a one-way street? It was a disaster. - How, why, she seems perfect! - She is. - So what'd you do? - You poor dear, I heard the date was a disaster. - I'm sorry I spoiled your PR extravaganza. - Oh, I'm not worried about that, I'm worried about you! - Oh, don't be. Momma will tell you I'm unlucky in love, I'm doing my best to prove it. - Alright... - Ladies, Jamie and I want to thank you for all of your hospitality, but it's time for us to go. - We have business in Mobile to attend to, you understand? - We can't let you leave like this. - Abby can't go, Jamie can go. - Thanks for that. - We just mean... - Yeah, I know. - It was a mistake, Abby. - It most certainly was. - Sorry. - Charlie says this is the best barbecue he's ever eaten, and he says it like it's a good thing. - Honey, I think you need to spend more time in the South. - Hey, I'm not the one who's in a rush to leave you know, I could hang out. - Abby? May I have five minutes, please? - Your citizen's committee has already spoken on your behalf Mayor Alexander, I assumed that was because you weren't willing to. - I'm a fool, I know that. - Well, then I think there's nothing more to say. - You, the woman who lets cabdrivers and bellhops tell her their life story while I've got reporters waiting? You can't give this guy five minutes to explain whatever it was that kept you up all night? - I will meet you at the barbecue. I'll only be three minutes behind. - I was hoping for five minutes, but I'll take three. - No, I'll take less than three to explain to you that I have nothing more to say. - You have to let me-- - I gave you a chance to explain last night, and you didn't. I opened up my heart to you with the belief that you would respect it but you didn't. Now, I hope that all these wonderful people that I met here will understand why I left. Since this was all their idea, clearly not yours all along. - Abby. - Goodbye, Spencer. - What on earth did you do? - Well, now who says he did anything? Well, you must have done something. - I just blew it. Plain and simple. - I doubt it's plain or simple. - Still, I don't wanna give you any the terrible burden of keeping my secrets, so... Let's just leave it at plain and simple. - But what now? - We pack away the fairytale and we get back to real life. Thank you. I appreciate your support and I ask for your forgiveness. - You need hers. - I wish she'd let me get that far. I can't remember a time that it hurt this much, momma. - I'm so sorry, baby. You come home soon as you can, spend some time with me, and Steve. - I'm done, momma. With the book tour? - With men! You just print up a sweatshirt with the word "spinster" and I will wear it. I will sit in the front pew of church every Sunday in my best hat and that sweatshirt and I will thank the Lord, God Almighty... - I don't think you have to give up exactly. Elmer? - I thought his name was Spencer? I gotta go momma, I love you. - Abby, wait wait, Abby! Abby! - Elmer? What happened? Ooh, how'd you get all the way out here? It's okay, sweetie. I'm gonna get you some help. Come on. Oh, oh I got ya, I got ya. Well, I found her on the side of the road, and I just couldn't imagine. - Let me do an exam to see what we're dealing with. Peggy can get you a cup of tea. - Oh, I can't stay, I just want to make sure that-- - She was on her way over, I'm sure she'll wanna thank you. - The only thanks I care about, are the ones you're gonna get when you make her feel better. - Are you sure you can't stay until things are mended? - I'm sorry, but no. - Not even just for Miss Eula? - Especially just for Miss Eula. Alright, you feel better girl. Thank you. - Good afternoon Miss, Miss Abby. - Oh, good afternoon. - Walter, from all the book signings. - I'm sorry, I just meet so many people, it takes me a bit to remember names. - Oh, that's okay. People tend not to remember me anyway. Did you lose something? - My phone, this morning. - I hate to bother you when you've got other things on your mind, but I have a big favor to ask. - What's that? - At the signing, I forgot to get a book for my aunt Jolene. And it'll break her heart. I have a book in the truck, could you sign it? I have a pen, i have a nice pen. It'll only take a second, and it'll mean the world to her. - Aunt Jolene? - Yes, for her birthday. - Happy birthday, Aunt Jolene. Oh, thank you. - There you go. - Oh, wow, thank you, thank you. There's just one other thing I need you to do. Uhm... I need you to get into the truck. - Sorry. Hello? - Jamie, I'm trying to reach Abby. - You know, so am I. She's not with you? - Well, we were supposed to meet for lunch, but she's not here yet. Jamie, I was talking to Abby while she was driving, and she said she had to hang up all of a sudden. I tried to call her back and she didn't answer. - You know, cell coverage here is awful. I'm sure she's just stuck in a bad area, in traffic. - Well, would you have her call me? As soon as she turns up? Yes, ma'am, I absolutely will. - Thank you. - Hello? - Spencer, it's Jamie. - What can I do for you, Jamie? Do you know if Abby left town right after me? - Well that's what the prayer chain says. - Okay. Uh, cause she's not here with me. I think something is wrong. - I'll make some calls. Yeah, hi Stephanie? Get me through to Ned, please. I'm fine, thank you. Can I speak with Ned, please, thank you. Yeah, Ned, it's Spencer calling. I'm doing fine, how are you doing? They're great, thank you very much for asking. Uh-huh, they're growing like weeds. Ned, I have a quick question to ask you. Have you seen a red Mustang traveling just by you? No, I think, no, I'm talking about the car not the horse, Ned. Ned, have you been drinking? What time is it? - People are waiting on me, Walter. - I've been waiting for a very long time. It's my turn now. - It's beautiful, is it yours? - It's been in my family for generations. My granddaddy used to come out here to hunt. I just like it cause it's peaceful. We're the only ones for miles. No one's gonna bother us here. Until we invite them to the wedding, hah. - We're clear here. Yeah I will, I will. - Miss Houston's car was found in the parking lot of Doctor Jordan's. - Oh, God love her for sacrificing herself to save Elmer! - I don't think that's quite what happened, Miss Eula. - Oh, well even so. - Yes, ma'am, even so. Abby doesn't... I mean Miss Houston doesn't know this area, so if she went wandering, she's pretty sure to be lost. - Now, we don't want anybody else to get lost or hurt looking for her, so let's be careful. - Your Deputy Ricky has a map showing the search sectors, prayer chain is gonna act as search team leaders, so divide yourselves up, find a prayer chain member, and let's get going. - I printed out some of the letters my assistant found in Abby's crazy fan file. - There's a whole file? - Abby has some very passionate fans, and I think we should consider that one of them is involved, but it's not like we were taking names at the door so... - We should call Susan-Marie, and find out if she's got any credit card receipts or e-mail orders that match anyone on this list. - Yes, oh. It's Abby's mom. I, I can't. - Use my phone, call Susan-Marie. - Okay. - Good evening, ma'am. Susan-Marie, it's Jamie. - This is uh, Spencer Alexander, I'm the mayor of Bliss. - Oh uh, I was looking for Jamie. - Yes ma'am, Jamie's on another line, she's gathering some excellent information to help us find your daughter. - So there's, there's no news. Not yet, but don't lose your faith. I have my entire sheriff's department and pretty much the whole town out looking for her. - I just, I feel so helpless. I asked Steve Marshall, an old beau of Abby's, to drive me there, but that good-for-nothing said no. - Oh, you don't need to be here to help. You just stay strong and pray and that'll help us all. And call anytime with anything and I'll be here. We're all working hard to help get Abby home. Well I appreciate that, mayor. - Spencer. - Spencer. Thank you, good night. - Good night. - Okay, great, thanks Susan-Marie. Susan-Marie has e-mails from this guy. - I'm calling the state troopers. - Tell me about your Aunt Jolene. - After my parents died, she and my Uncle Buddy took me in and raised me. She uhm, she died last year. - I'm so sorry for all your loss, Walter. What happened to your sisters? - I don't have any sisters. - What about the books in Nashville? - Oh no it's, I just made up some people to get books for so I could stand in line longer. - What about your uncle Buddy? - Well he's real. He's real. But since Aunt Jolene died, he doesn't do much but sit in his recliner and watch the NASCAR races. He's uhm, he's pretty sad. I'm sure you are, too. - I was. But not anymore, because you're here and we're gonna be so happy together. - We can't stay here, Walter. - Yes, we can, yes we can! Look, just don't say that, yes we can. I have a shed with provisions for a couple months and I have my own generator, and I have a trunk of clothes for you. Do you want to change right now? - No, not right now, thank you. - Okay, okay, you just... You just let me know when. I just want you to be happy. Everything I've done has been to make you happy. I never would have hurt that dog otherwise. - You hurt Elmer, on purpose? - Last night when that stupid mayor was so mean to you... - You were watching us in the park? - I need to take care of you, that's what people in love do. I saw how hurt you were and I knew you were gonna leave. But I couldn't let you go, not when I had everything all ready. Stupid, yappy dog was bugging me, so I... That's when I realized he could help me get your attention. - She... - I'd seen you be sweet to her, so I knew you'd come back if you saw her. So I just drove out and waited. I'm good at waiting. I've waited for a very long time. - First off, I'd like to thank you all for cooperating with the sheriff's department and the state troopers. We're gonna move the search out even farther, but we're not gonna lose heart. May the Lord bless our efforts to find Abby and keep her safe until we find her. Amen! - Do you all know your instructions? Yep! - Let's go. Come on kids, come on. You, you didn't eat much. - I'm not very hungry. - I'll get to know what you like and I'll cook that. All your favorites. Do you want to get a dog, I can get us a dog of our own. - I just want to sleep right now, it's been a bit of a day. - Of course, what was I thinking? I'm supposed to take care of you and I'm not doing a very good job. - I just think we both need a rest, I mean it's been very hectic. - You're right, you're right. The bedroom's over here. You can sleep in the bed, I'll sleep in the chair out here. I'll be right here keeping you safe. - Thank you. - What was that? - Uh something just hit the side of the house, it scared me. Are there bears around here? - That's why this is a hunting cabin. I'll protect you. You just stay here! - No thank you! Yea though I walk through the valley of whatever's out there... A car! - Where are you going? - He's not dangerous, they need to know that! - He kidnapped you, Abby! - He's just confused. And lonely, and hurt. And he needs a doctor. - Well, we will get him all the appropriate care the great state of Mississippi can offer. - Okay. - Abby Houston, I'm trying to save you, here! - I'm saving myself! - And I want to help a little! - Fine, I need my shoes. I was trying to be quiet. - I can imagine. - Well, I need to get them. - Buy another pair! Gun's empty, boss. - I'm fine, momma. Thank you for everything you did to help Jamie and Spencer find me. - Oh, baby girl, I am so thankful that you are okay. Me too, momma. - I need to confess something. - It's okay, momma. - No, it's not, I was completely wrong about Steve. That boy's more useless than a screen door in a flood. You deserve better. - Thank you momma. - You need a decisive man, one who's your equal in strength and perseverance. Someone with good qualities that are apparent to everyone who knows him. The kind of man who would make a good mayor. - I see. - Well I hope you do. You tell that Spencer Alexander, that I am forever in his debt. - Good night, momma, I love you. I love you too, baby. - Your momma doing okay now? - She is, thank you. I take it you talked to her through all this. - I had the privilege of doing it more than once. She's a remarkable woman. - Thank you for coming for me. - I'm just glad you're okay. What the... - Mayor Alexander? We have been instructed to escort you back to Bliss. - Hmm... Okay everybody, they're here! - Abby, I just wanted to explain... Oh my gosh! I was so scared! - I'll be okay, I'm all good. - Out of the car, mayor! You've got press to tend to. Come on, give me a hug. Why do you seem smaller? Oh, I lost my shoes. Oh my, we gotta get you some. Or no, that'll look great for the pictures. So we can address the town, and then we'll do press. - I need to talk to Abby for a moment. Oh, but you were just in the car with her-- - Jamie. - We'll be right there. - I'll, I'll just uh, go over, okay. Before things get any crazier, I need to explain about last night. It's okay. - Yes, I do. The champagne wasn't sent from Lorraine or any other woman in town who set their cap for me. - Even though there are many? - It was sent from my late wife's parents. - Oh... - And the note said, it said they were so pleased I had a new chance for happiness, and they knew that Laurie was too. They sent the champagne to offer their blessing. And in the middle of that beautiful night, I just couldn't take it all in. And that wasn't fair to you. And I know I hurt you, and I apologize for that. And I don't have any right to ask you for anything, but if you could just forgive me? - So here we are, saying goodbye again. Bye. - Now, I had to call in some pretty big favors to rework your schedule, so you better enjoy those extra few days I shook loose. - I promise I will. - Alright, especially after your little escapade with Walter has driven your sales through the roof! I've added another ten cities to the tour. Don't worry, I've already talked to momma and she and Kazoo are already okay with it. - Thanks for that. - But if you're not in Mobile by 10 a.m. on Tuesday, I will have a heart attack. - I'll get her there on time. - You better, just kidding give me a squeeze. See ya, y'all! Bye. Ah... Are you sure you have time to go to Mobile with me? - Yes! I wish I could go on the whole tour with you. - Are we crazy? Trying to build a future when I've got my momma and books in Georgia and you've got your children and a whole town here? - Don't you have to be just a little crazy to fall in love? - Well, if we're both crazy, I guess it's worth a try. - I think this might help. - Oh, Spencer, is this a key to the town? - No. Don't look so disappointed. It's the key to my heart. - Oh... Thank you. - Thank you. I was pretty sure I'd lost that until you showed up. - Well, you also have to thank Bliss. I've never seen such unconditional love before. - Well, stick around. We're kinda good at that here. - Yeah, well if you want me to stick around, then you gotta tell me something. - Whats that? - You gotta tell me how I earn the key to the town. - Looks like the real thing to me! - Das boot! - Let's invite the entire women's prayer breakfast! - Has anyone told Lorraine? The beauty of writing a new chapter is you're never quite sure where it's gonna end. And all the places I've been, and all the stories I've told, I don't believe I've ever known of an entire town falling in love, and of someone falling right back. But what else can you do when you finally find Bliss? Because Bliss found you.
