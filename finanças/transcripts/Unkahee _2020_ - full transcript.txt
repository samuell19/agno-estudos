'In 2017, I had a case.' 'And this is its file.' 'Make sure you destroy it.' Welcome to our special episode of 'Law and Order' and today we'll be discussing about the murders that took place in Delhi... that have enslaved the entire city by fear. In the last 12 months 11 women have been found dead at various metro stations in Delhi. But the police have found no evidence against the killer. The police strongly believe that a serial killer is responsible for these murders. What's more shocking is that every victim's heart is missing from the body and the police found a playing card on every corpse. According to the police six residents of Delhi are under suspicion. Krish Malhotra, Roshan Kher, Tia Sharma Deepak Mehra, Santosh Hooda, and Abhimanyu Mathur. When will this brutal murder spree come to an end? For further discussion on these murders today we have online with us senior officer of Delhi Police, Shergill. Hello, Shergill sir. On behalf of our audience, I'd like to ask you why the police have failed to arrest the murderer who brutally killed 11 women in the last 12 months? 'Ma'am, before the case is even closed' 'why are you declaring that the police failed?' 'The case is ongoing and the police is doing their job.' 'And I guarantee' 'that the serial killer won't be able to take another life.' Sir, the Delhi Police have said so since the very first murder. After that, another ten innocent women lost their lives and yet, your statement remains the same. How many more corpses would it take for Delhi Police to catch the murderer? 'If you plan on wasting my time by asking me such stupid questions' 'then this interview is over.' You can't run from it, sir. You have to answer. Ma'am, if you ask me the correct questions I will definitely give you the correct answers. If you'll ask me such stupid questions just for the sake of TRP then I am not interested. Sir, we've just found out that all the six prime suspects are missing for the last three hours. Really? So, what's your question? Sir, we have no clue about the killer, but how can all the six suspects be missing from the city at the same time? Did you shoot them all in an encounter? 'Ma'am, tell me something.' 'Are you more interested in the serial killer' 'or those six suspects?' Sir, do not change the subject, each question is interrelated with the other. And it is quite simple. 'Ma'am, I guarantee the entire nation on your channel' 'that in the next 12 hours' 'Delhi Police will bring the serial killer in front of you.' 'And this is my word to the nation.' Sir, a case that has been unsolved for the last 12 months, how will it be solved in the next 12 hours? Sir? Seems like we lost connection with encounter-specialist Mr. Shergill. So, as you heard it encounter-specialist Shergill claims that he will find the serial killer in the next 12 hours, the one he hasn't been able to find in the last 12 months. All the six prime suspects are missing at once. Is the serial killer responsible for this or are new events are going to unfold before us? Where are those six suspects? Open the damn door! Buddy! Calm down. We're all equally scared. - Come on. - There is no other choice, Uncle. Where are we? What's going on? We don't know where we are. Bring the table in the centre. Get up! Right in the centre! Sir... Sir, we've been stuck here for the last three hours. And we seriously don't know what's going on. Can you please tell us? Exactly, sir. I haven't done anything. Sir, I am innocent. All those stations where these murders took place you were found in every station's CCTV footage. And you're saying you're innocent? I am Shergill. Encounter-specialist. And when I think about these murders, I feel like shooting you all dead and dumping you on the streets. But I want to give a benefit of doubt to the innocent. That's why, these files... These files... have all the evidence, CCTV footages... and all those proofs that we have collected so far. I'm giving you only 12 hours. In these 12 hours, you decide among yourselves who the serial killer is. And in these 12 hours, if you fail to decide... who the serial killer is... I'll have to use this. And I'll reach my score of 82. Inspector Singh, for the next 12 hours... you'll make sure they don't eat or drink. Not a single drop of water. No visit to the loo either. - But, sir-- - Sir! Sir, you're literally bullying us! Once I am out, I'll sue you! You'll sue me only if you are out! - But, sir-- - Sir, please! Sir, at least give us a chance. Sir, please! I want to smoke. Does anybody have one? Come here, I'll give you something to smoke. You want to smoke? There can be an encounter-- Let go of him! - What's going on? - What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? How dare you hit a woman! Hit that cop if you have the guts! Sit down! He is the serial killer! Bloody psycho! He's right. You are the killer! Let's see the file, we'll find out. - Sure, go ahead. - What's your name? Santosh. Look it up! Listen carefully, I didn't do the murders. Get it straight, otherwise... Otherwise what? I have other ways. - Stop it! Stop! - Ma'am, explain it to him! Listen, I get it. We're all very scared right now. Okay? We're all stressed out. But fighting with each other is not going to help. Get one thing. We have very less time and we don't even know each other. So, instead of fighting it's better we do what Shergill wants us to. Let's just solve this case. Please? - I didn't even say anything. - Please don't. - Can we get to work? - Absolutely. Okay. I'll arrange the cases as per their dates. Right. A playing card was found on every corpse. And every card is a different number. I can't do this. You go ahead. What's going on? This old man is so faint-hearted, he can't even look at the photo. And that old man doesn't realize that we are innocent. This is unfair. Tia, help me with some more pictures please. Cards. What happened to you? What's his name? Kr... Krish. Guys, I want to smoke. And now I just have to. He's a junkie. Where do we get the stuff for you? Tell me. - Deepak-ji... - You look after him. Oh, man! He'll be okay, he's just an addict. Move it, guys. Come on. Come on, we don't have time. The first murder took place on 29th November, 2016. Where a three of hearts was found on the corpse. And the time recorded is 6:00 to 8:00. Krish, where were you that day? What the f**k is wrong with you? I don't remember where I was yesterday. How would I remember where I was a year ago? Maybe I was... I play the drum at Harvest School. I mean, I am in the band. No wonder! So, maybe I was there. The word "maybe" means you could be anywhere, doing anything. If you're so certain about yourself, why don't you tell us? - Why are you here? - Shergill told us. He was at every station where a dead body was found. Among all the passengers, the CCTV footage singled Deepak-ji out. That's a very sad coincidence. If you're not the killer, that is. You know what I mean? What do you do? I work for a customer retainer-ship company. I visit the homes of angry customers and try convincing them not to cancel the connections of particular phone companies. - I have all the alibees as well. - "Alibis." Alibi, yes. They've given their statements too. Thanks to my misfortune, this "coincidence" is stuck with me. Even if you were fortunate, you'd still be here. And where were you, oh, jinxed one? I was with my ex-wife. Her parents weren't home so I went there to negotiate the divorce terms. - You are? - I'll tell you. - Roshan. - Roshan. - Where does you ex-wife stay? - She used to. Mayur Vihar. He got a girl from the east. - No wonder she left-- - Shut up, Santosh! This is not the time for jokes. Forget it. Let's move on. So... I think we should make the crime wall first. Let me tell you guys about myself. My wallet was stolen. And I didn't know where. Then they told me it was found at the murder scene. - Where? - Civil Lines. They received an anonymous tip about the murder. Tia... you're Regional Manager at Airtel South Delhi? What were you doing at Civil Lines? Your office is in South Delhi. And you stay in... Listen, I know. I know, okay? And why did you pick up my picture? You don't mean to put it out there, right? Listen, guys, I'm not a murderer or anything. Please! Don't put my picture there, please. Thank you. So the thing is... I wanted to get out of Delhi, I mean... I seriously want to leave Delhi and I just tried to bribe my HR guy. And he was on that route so I had to take that route to meet him that day. Why didn't you tell the cop? Excuse me? I would've lost my job. Ma'am, you'll have a job when you have a life. Got it? Piya was your friend, right? - That's just a coincidence. - Too much of a coincidence. This entire universe is built upon a coincidence. So, this can be a coincidence too. Yeah... Oh, yes! Piya was also in separation with her husband. It is a possibility that... you were having an extra-marital affair with her husband and she wasn't willing to divorce him, so... So, I obviously killed her for that, right? Are you mad? First of all, I wasn't having an extra-marital affair with Piya's husband. Not at all. So these theories are nonsensical. So, why were they getting divorced? Maybe Piya liked or loved someone else! Have you thought about that? Ma'am, what you're saying is... Piya had a "fella" on the side? You are unbelievable! Seriously. Do you have the slightest idea of what can happen with us? But all you want to do is crack jokes! And for heaven's sake a girl is dead! Do you have any respect for the dead as well? Do you even understand what respect is? Ma'am, can you please speak in Hindi? - What is she saying? - Show some respect for the dead. Okay. Sorry, ma'am. Ma'am, is that your photo over there? You! You... "Santos"! You drive a BMW, right? What were you doing at a metro station? Tell! It's mentioned in there. Wait, let me tell you. I was taking a metro to my friend's place. And the body was right there. Who called the cops? I did. And those fools consider me a suspect. And let me add, it's been six months. They barged in this morning and brought me here. They didn't even let me wash up. You're not the only one who's worried, we are too. Family money! A man who drives a BMW took a metro to his friend's place. Listen up, buddy! It's not family money. My father left me a farm and died. Luckily, the farm turned out to be in Gurgaon. So I bought a Mercedes and BMW. But I am still very grounded, I am a simple man. Can't I take a metro? All the big shot businessmen take it. Everyone's a "James Bond" here! They found a woman's dress in your possession. I told you. He is the serial killer. People like him don't hesitate for a second before hitting women. People like me? You jerk! We don't hesitate a second before hitting men too. - I'll bury you right here, a**hole! - What's going on? I think better that cop kill us in an encounter. Are you fine? Hey, Uncle. I'm the one who got hit... not you. Another word and you'll have more coming your way. Haven't you heard of Manushi? She won the Miss World and she's from my village. Did that ring a bell? "People like me!" How much do you cry, man? - Are you alright? - I am fine. Thanks. Dimple... was my wife. Dimple Mathur, victim of 2017. Why didn't you tell us? Everything's written in there! It's also written that you hit her. - Yes. - And she reported you? Okay, fine. And within a month, she was found murdered. But that doesn't mean I killed her or any other woman. But it's written here that she was pregnant. How many times will I have to have the same discussion? Yes, she was pregnant. I wanted a baby but she did not. She lied to me and got an abortion. So that's why you killed her? Are you crazy? Look, after that... I was trying to work it out. But she wanted to leave me. She said she couldn't forget... how I treated her, so... She asked for a divorce. So, to rid yourself of alimony problems, you killed her. What the f**k is wrong with you people? Okay, fine. Hypothetically, let's consider this accusation valid. But timeline... According to the timeline, she broke my heart in December. Then why would I have killed Shivani in November and Manisha in December? And just... Just try and understand one thing, guys. I didn't even know these women. Why would I suddenly kill Dimple in January? It doesn't make sense. All right? And what about Krish? They found him at the murder site. Why aren't you talking about him? They detected heroin in Krish's blood. He was injecting himself hiding in a corner at the murder site. He didn't even know there was a corpse ten feet away. I don't think he has any idea. Just look at him. And you! Why are you talking about him, Roshan? - We're not done with you yet. - Really? And why are you protecting Krish? Maybe you two were accomplices in these killings. What? What rubbish! It's not rubbish, my friend. Look in the file. What's your name? Abhimanyu, right? Tell me, where were you? Why have they brought you here? You're an investment banker, right? So, what's your connection in all of this? I didn't do the murders. Well, isn't that something all of us are claiming here? Abhimanyu's footprints and fingerprints were found at four different murder scenes. Dwarka Sector 2, Udyog Nagar, Madipur and New Delhi! Fingerprints and footprints at four locations? I mean... None of this is mentioned in the files. What were you doing at these locations? I think he's the killer. You've been pinning our photos on the map all the time. Now you're s**t-scared because everyone's blaming you. Arrest him. He's the killer, arrest him. Shut up! Another word and I'll punch you! If I were the killer... I wouldn't be so interested in solving this thing. No, Abhimanyu. You know what? Serial killers usually like to gloat about their killings. They like playing games with everyone's minds. How do you know? You're equally interested in solving this case. You're enjoying the process. I mean, he hits you... and instead of crying or reacting... you're more interested in solving this case? Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. And guess what? That's because there's a gun put onto my head as it is on yours and everyone else's out here. And if we don't believe each other... let's stop blaming each other. Let's properly study this case. Can we do that? Ma'am, I'm with you. So, the age group of the women murdered... was between 23 to 28 years. All right, but the old man? He's wooing young girls? - How do you manage-- - And each woman... was found with a card of hearts on her. Their hearts were literally scooped out. All right, listen. I think one of these women... broke the serial killer's heart. And then every woman who ever broke some guy's heart was killed. That's why he scooped their hearts out. Right? It sounds logical. These women had recently broken up or divorced their partner. Right. But, amidst all of this... how does Tia fit in? I mean, the victim Piya was her friend. And Tia wasn't having an affair with her husband... yet, she was getting divorced. Something is missing here. Guys, Piya's husband... wasn't having an affair with Tia. Tia was having an affair with Piya. So, why were they getting divorced? Maybe Piya liked or loved someone else! Have you thought about that? Remember? Tia said maybe Piya liked someone else. I don't think I am wrong here, but... Tia's a lesbian. Wow! Lesbian? You mean, girl-on-girl, right? - Yuck! - Love has no boundaries. Piya was my girlfriend. And, in any case I haven't killed her. Why would I kill her? I loved her. And we were going to move to Mumbai after her divorce. Don't your parents say anything to you? No. And judge me all you like. I don't care. Roshan-- Stop wasting yours and everybody else's time. As I said earlier... I didn't kill Dimple or any of these women. Really? We'll come back to you. Taking Santosh's theory into consideration, we have to figure out... what's the connection between heartbreak and the heart cards. - What's the connection? - That's what we need to figure. Hearts are usually a symbol of love. Yes, and playing cards have meta symbols. Uncle, you gamble? Disgusting. Have you got no shame? Does nobody stop you? I play the intellectual game of poker. Ever heard of it? Later, I lost and I quit playing. How shameful! I was an ardent player too. I used to bet and lose a lot of Dad's money, when I was young. After Mom's death I decided, never again, boss. Your wife wanted a divorce because you were a gambler, right? The pregnancy and all, it's just a facade, right? Your gambling addiction drove you crazy and you killed her. Which language do you understand? You still haven't said anything about your whereabouts and you're blaming me without any logic. What's wrong with you? Abhimanyu, Roshan is right. I am an addict too. Otherwise I'd have had an airplane. What were you saying about meta symbols? Yeah, actually... everything in life has a deep connection. Similarly, playing cards have a deep significance. For instance, the two of hearts. What does it mean? Two broken parts make one full. Which means the two of hearts is a symbol of one eternal love. The more deeply you study... the more symbolic meanings you'll find. Uncle, you're so knowledgeable. Why are you doing such a simple job? Son, earlier, I was a computer specialist in a security company. I was growing old so I retired. Who would give me a job at this age? My mother is also very old. The old man's older mother is still alive? You've been calling me old for a while but I am not that old. - I'm only 60. - Uncle! Shall we concentrate on saving our lives, please? - Tell him! - Wait a minute! Playing cards are according to the lunar year, right? This is too complicated. I'm done. First the old man and now you! - You carry on. - Abhimanyu, you're very right. I have read about the lunar year as well. Each month has 29 and a half days. That means there are not 12 but 13 months in a year. Exactly like playing cards. 13 one of a kind cards, four sets... which equals to 52 cards. If you look carefully... we've got the cards in a chronology. Pass that paper! Quickly! See, murder date, time and location. Look at the pattern. On odd days, the bodies were found on the red and blue line. And on the even days, on the yellow and green line. The killer is very smart... - and organized. - Did you notice another thing? If the card is a 3... the body was found on the 3rd station on the red line. And if the card is a 4... the body was found on the 4th station on the yellow line. Exactly! And every murder has a gap of 29 and a half days. And the murder timings are the same. The killer is deeply influenced by playing cards. And by those women... who were recently broken-up or divorced. But how does he find out about these women and their relationship status? Maybe he ripped-off a marketing company's data. Or a phone company. Why are you looking at me? Hello! I haven't done anything, okay? And by the way... Deepak-ji also works for a phone company, right? But I don't have access to the system. The data is provided to me. So what? You must find so many people from that data. Moreover, you have personal contacts with them. This means, the killer not only had the data... but also their personal details. Because each of these women had broken somebody's heart. This is classified information. Roshan, you're a hacker, right? I was, when I was Krish's age. You haven't turned old enough to forget hacking. I meant, I'm not a hacker anymore. Yup! I am not the serial killer. This is all because of Dimple. Never get involved with women! He's absolutely right. That's why my people kill them as soon as they are born. Nip them right in the bud. You're showing what you truly are! I can't see your "Miss World" right now. Where is she? Shut up, man. Santosh, you never told us why you had a women's dress. And why do you hate women? I only agreed with him. What's the problem? There was a huge difference, Santosh! Me and my friends... we like to cross-dress sometimes, that's it. You cross-dress? Really? Stop it, guys. He's a cross-dresser. Come on, let's not embarrass him for that. Okay, so the two of us are in telecom, right? And Abhimanyu could also have the data access. Because you're a banker. And Roshan was a hacker, Deepak-ji is in security. Everyone's different here. Nobody's all-in-one. But if someone's hiding anything, it's Abhimanyu. He knows hacking. Or else how would he know... that by accessing or hacking someone's data... one can have all access to their personal life. - That's common knowledge, right? - Still. I suspect him the most. I think right now we need to solve the first murder's modus operandi and the motive behind it. Exactly. So far, there is no evidence against Deepak-ji. Except he was present at every metro station where the dead bodies were found. And Tia's wallet was found at one of the murder sites. Roshan's ex was murdered. They had a violent past. Krish was found near the corpse and Santosh had reported the corpse. And your fingerprints and footprints were found at four murder sites. Yet there is one thing I still don't understand. Even though everything is so well organized. The cards, locations, murders, timings, everything! Why did the killer start with number 3? - The ace and the two come before 3. - Correct! Does that mean that there were two more murders before this and... According to the game... the player always uses the ace in the end to win the game. You mean trump card? Victory card of sorts? Correct. That means there was a murder where a two of hearts should've been found. That means... there should've been 12 bodies, but they found 11. According to the pattern... the murder should've taken place on 31st October, 2016. And the body should've been found... at the second metro station on the green line... at Rajdhani Park. But there is no such body found. Yes, that's quite strange. What's so strange? The killer is a dumbf**k, that's it. Listen to me, he's a crazy person. I... I don't think so. If he's working as per a definite pattern... he wouldn't start like this. What if he got scared because it was his first murder? You're right. It was definitely his girlfriend who broke his heart. But how is it possible that all bodies were found except one? The site has been dug up for a year. The body must've fell in the pit. Yeah but someone would've definitely found it. However I still think... he started the murders with the ace. Because the ace is number one. That's where it starts. Exactly. Why would anyone start with two? That's like starting in the middle. You're not getting it. As per the meta symbols, the ace is used in the end. There you go again, old man. If you have nothing to do with these women why are you getting involved? This dude is right. It starts with the ace. Okay so, there were two murders where the bodies were not found, right? Right. I told you, the two of hearts symbolises eternal love. Similarly, the ace is an ego card. The "I am" card. Victory card. Which is always used for victory. That's why... there must've been only one murder. I think he's right. But it always starts with number one, the ace. You're running around in circles, Abhimanyu. I'm telling you, it must've started with two. How do you know? - It always starts with the two. - But how do you know? - How can you tell? - Because I know that the two of hearts means one eternal love. And Uma was my eternal love. She was my first and last love. But when she ditched me I killed her! And I planted the two of hearts in her body. But those dumbf**ks never found her body. They did. They found the body and the killer. Holy cow! So, the police found Deepak-ji's girlfriend's body? They always knew it was Deepak-ji. All they needed was just a confession. And all I needed was just a joint, man. Guys, I am CBI officer Abhimanyu. What the f**k! And thank you so much for your help. Thank you.
