Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Wow, to think that Hae Na is really becoming the company's successor. {\a6}Episode 11 It's hard to believe. Seriously. Speaking of which, Su Ah, what happens to you? What happens to me? What does that mean? In this contest you couldn't even put up a fight, and you lost. You probably didn't have a chance from the start. Think whatever you like. But we'll see what happens in the end. Well, hope you have a good time. By the way... Things should get interesting later, so don't leave too early. Is that the truth? Why would I lie? The reason Oppa entered Kang Hae Na's household was to seduce her. Of course, he's given that up now. But... Do you know what's even worse? The fact that Oppa loves Kang Hae Na. My wish? is this? Don't leave. Even though Grandfather has come back, don't go, and stay by my side. That's my wish. Why aren't you saying anything? Agasshi, it's time to go now. You'll be watching out for me, right? Of course I will, Agasshi. Let's go. Yes, I understand. Hey, Eui Joo! - Oppa! - When did you get here? You should have called. Well? you see? Oppa, I'm sorry. Nevermind, I'm not sorry. I've done nothing to be sorry for. What are you talking about? - I've gotta go. - Eui Joo! Eui Joo! What's wrong with her? I understand, I'm on my way. Well, when you get old, you get lazy, and even getting out of the house becomes a hassle. I even thought about staying home today, but this old man managed some bravado. I've gathered you here today to introduce you to the person who will lead Kangsan Group. At this meaningful forum, I wanted to introduce her formally to all of you. Hae Na. National and international members of the Kangsan Group family, allow me to introduce myself as the future leader of Kangsan Group? Ka? Kang Hae Na. I am... You're ridiculous! - There is no way this could be! - Director Kang doesn't even have any experience! Those of you who are leaving! Stop for a moment. How can you leave while someone is speaking? The truth is, even when I think about it, it does seem ridiculous that I would be the successor of Kangsan Group. I have no skills, no talent. The only thing I have backing me is that I'm the Chairman's granddaughter. To make me the successor seems like a joke. But, I also have some pride. Since this opportunity has presented itself, how could I give up without even trying? My pride won't allow for it. It's true that I don't know very much. In fact, I don't know anything. I didn't study very hard, and there aren't many things I can claim to do well. But I will give it my best effort. Though I may not have tried it before, I take after my Grandfather, so I have the smarts. Please give me this opportunity. If, after I've put forth my best efforts, you still believe that I don't have what it takes, then, I'll step down of my own volition. Wait, Hae Na? What I'm saying is that no matter how much my Grandfather wants to hand this position to me, I wouldn't accept it. If I promise you this, will I have your approval? Do you know what you've just done? You've given Director Kang a pretext to push you out. In that situation, why would you say anything regarding stepping down? Why would you say something so thoughtless? It's not like I said anything untrue. Then were you boasting because you're confident you'll succeed? No? I was just? angry. This is so frustrating, very frustrating. Anyway since you've created this mess, you take care of it, alright? Make sure there's no reason for Director Kang to speak his nonsense or point his finger at you. God, this is such a? I'm so frustrated too, this is seriously so frustrating. I want to go home! Butler Seo, Butler Seo? I don't need to explain why I'm acting like this, do I? That's not what I took you for, but how can you shock the people around you like this? Butler Seo, back then you said this to me: To take my hands off Agasshi. Those words, I'm turning them back on you. As for you, take your hands off Hae Na. This very instant. Tae Yoon! When did you get here? A little while ago. Since you said you'd be late, I thought you weren't able to make it. But? what have the two of you been doing? We were just talking. Let's go. I'll give you a ride home. I should have just read off the speech. I don't know what made me say big things full of hot air. I'm really worried about what's next. Are you listening? Yes. Of course. Is something wrong? Since before you've looked like something's bothering you. It's nothing, I'm just tired. Tae Yoon, I think you won't be able to see much of me for a while. I'll be busy with working at the company. Seriously, I'm not going to have a life. If working is too difficult? Do you want to get married? Wha.. really, Tae Yoon, are you kidding? Why would we be thinking about marriage already? But I'm not kidding. Let's get married. Yes, Ahjumma. What in the world is going on? Do you know why she's been like this all day? Did something happen between you two? Ahjumma, it's not a big deal, so don't worry too much. And tell Eui Joo that I'm okay, so she shouldn't feel bad about it. What is that supposed to mean? - Hey! - What! Don't just sit there like that all day! Explain to me what's going on! Explain what?! But why would Tae Yoon suddenly say we should get married? - Agasshi? - Oh my god! You scared me! What are you so scared of? Have you committed a sin? But why are you so late? Huh? Oh, I was talking to Tae Yoon. Tae Yoon asked me to marry him. Marry? Congratulations! That's good news. You feel good about it, right? Oh? of course, it's good. It's good, but I feel kind of strange. I wonder whether it's okay for me to marry so soon. Agasshi, what are you talking about? Do you think there are many men in the world like Attorney Lee? Shouldn't you be thankful that he would want to take in a walking accident like you? But, it seems like you're happy to hear that I might get married. Of course I'm happy. It means automatic freedom from a life of servitude. - What? - Agasshi... If you get married, don't keep a butler. Rather, Attorney Lee should fulfill the role of your butler. What are you saying? It's late, you should rest. Yes, I should. Then, good night. By the way, Agasshi. Today you were quite impressive? How so? "My pride won't allow for it." Your confidence and commanding presence were very impressive. In the future, continue to live as that impressive Kang Hae Na. It suits you, Agasshi. Then? Both of them are acting weird. Oh, you're the one who bought the couple rings last time, right? Yes. But I'd like to exchange the ring. Why? Your girlfriend didn't like it? It's not that. I'd like to exchange it for a wedding ring. Oh, I see. I am planning to quit. Had I known this was such a burden to you, I would have left sooner. The truth is, when I came back, I thought long and hard about it. If I came back to repay the debt I felt, would I be doing the right thing? I had a lot of regrets. If there was room for any misunderstandings, it was entirely my fault. Agasshi has done nothing wrong, since I was the only one who had feelings involved. When are you leaving? Please give me a day or two to wrap things up. I want to apologize sincerely for the things that have upset you. And also... Don't forget that you are the only one Agasshi likes. Well then? The top fifth of the industry? In one month?! In that case, how much would sales have to increase? It would require a 15% increase over previous sales. Fifteen percent? Of course, I realize it will be hard to do. But Director Kang, didn't you yourself say in front of everyone that if you can't prove your skill, you won't be the successor? What? Have you lost your confidence? Nonsense. If that's all, then I'll do it. All I have to do is raise sales by 15% and be in the industry's top fifth, right? Fine. I'll do so. Is that so? You're brimming with confidence, are you? You can count on it. However, when I formally become the successor, you had all better be ready. Because I'll be keeping all of this in mind. Director Kang is a fierce competitor. This is worrisome. There's nothing to worry about. She doesn't know a thing. Does she think it's easy to raise sales by 15%? She's trapped! They don't take me seriously, but wait and see. They think I can't do it? But where has Seo Dong Chan gone? Hey! I've caught you. Hey, you little brat. You think if you run away, I won't be able to catch you? Ahh, Oppa stop? That's right, I said it all. I told Attorney Lee everything in one fell swoop. If you want to hate me, then hate me. Or if you're bitter, then be bitter. What? Do you have something to say? Eui Joo, I understand that you feel sorry, but there's no need. What? I'm actually grateful to you. Oppa. Honestly, I was always on edge. What happens if someone finds out? Of course, since Agasshi was understanding, I felt a little better. But still, I did feel uneasy about it. But since Attorney Lee has found out too, I actually think it's better this way. Was Attorney Lee very angry with you? Isn't that obvious? If it were me, I wouldn't just let it go either. It wouldn't have ended with just one fist. Fist? Oppa, did you get hit? I didn't think Attorney Lee was like that, but his temper won't do! Next time, I'll revenge you! Well, that's that. Eui Joo... Thanks. Oppa! If you quit being a butler, you'll come home, right? Don't go somewhere else just because I told you I like you. Of course I will. Clean my room for me. Okay? If working is too difficult, do you want to get married? Your confidence and commanding presence were very impressive. In the future, continue to live as that impressive Kang Hae Na. It suits you, Agasshi. Agasshi! You said you would raise sales by 15%? On what basis did you make that promise? What are you so nervous about? All I have to do is raise it 15%. Gosh, this is unbelievable. Despite how mediocre your work approach may be, do you think 15% is a walk in the park? And in a large enterprise like this, do you know how hard it is to raise sales by even 10%? Then what was I supposed to do? Everyone was out to get me. Even so, how could you just say it without thinking? If it goes wrong, it's not just you'll be disgraced. What about the Chairman's reputation? Don't you realize their main goal is to disgrace the Chairman? Now that I think about it, that's true. With the launch tomorrow, there's no time to lose. We have to pull an all-nighter tonight, so be ready. All-nighter? Really, an all-nighter? Yes. We have to make this a success. Do you want Miss Su Ah looking down on you? No? I wouldn't want that. Then I'll go bring in the planning team, so you focus on finishing the plan. Butler Seo! Yes? Nevermind, it's nothing. Alright, I've brought late-night food. Have some while you work! Wow! You're the best! Here. You must be hungry. Agasshi, here is the zucchini pizza you like. Mine's all ready! It's so interesting. It's nearly dawn, yet there's a lot of people out. Agasshi, you wouldn't know it, but other people live diligently. Look over there, look. Agasshi, you should know your life is easy. So what you're saying is I've lived well because I was born into the lap of luxury? At least you know it. Don't overdo it. I spent the whole night working till now. True. You know? How come you didn't tell me you met up with Tae Yoon? I feel like an idiot. I should have realized when Tae Yoon brought up marriage. Are you okay? Were your feelings hurt? No, it's not like I have the right to be hurt. But, you know? Oh! Look, it's nearly morning! Th... that's true! Agasshi. Could I give you a gift in honor of your business launch? A gift? - Where the heck are we going? - C'mon and hurry up. We'll be late. What's the big deal? Can't we go later? Gosh! We've got to get up there quickly. Alright? - Ugh, I'm tired! - You're still young! Hang in there. Left, right! Left, right, left right! What is this? There's nothing here. Just wait a little bit. What is it that you want to show me? Morning. I used to go up to the hospital rooftop with my mother, waiting like this for morning to come. The feeling that everything would work out well. The confidence to start anew is alive and well. The feeling of being alive. This feeling is what I wanted to give you. Agasshi, congratulations on your new beginning. And this is how you're starting your life anew. And? as of now, I'm leaving this position. I'm sorry I'm unable to grant your wish that I stay with you. But... my heart is light. I probably? can't try to keep you, can I? Agasshi. I know, I know that I can't. I wonder, can I get along without you? Why would a worthless butler like me be so important to Princess Kang Hae Na? Agasshi, you're a person who can do well in everything without me. While you've been back, has it been hard for you? No. This time? I've been happy. Butler Seo... before you quit... This time around, I'll let you go first. Seo Dong Chan, you're fired. Hey, Eui Joo. Eui Joo! What? Is it true that Dong Chan quit his job? Yeah, he said that he was going to quit. Really? Why would he quit such a good job? That's strange? Well, he said he was only planning to stay until the Chairman came back anyway. Gosh. But they said he quit yesterday, so where the heck has he been? He quit yesterday? Really? Yeah. The manager said that he quit yesterday and left the house. Then where has he gone? He said he would come home. I'm sure he'll come. It's not as if he doesn't know how to get here. Hurry up and go to work. So where has he gone? The launch of the shopping mall isn't a bad achievement for Agasshi. That's not enough. If she doesn't want to raise opposition, she has to finish it definitively, and that's what I'm worried about. That being said, why didn't you try to prevent Butler Seo from leaving? He was quite determined. Still, there's no one as good for Hae Na as Butler Seo. It would be nice if he could stay until she gets married. I don't understand why he keeps insisting on leaving. I think I know the reason. What is it? Oh. It's nothing. In any case, I'd like to make time to meet Attorney Lee and talk about Hae Na's marriage. I wonder if you might be rushing Agasshi's marriage. - Agasshi is still young. - What are you saying? You know well that I don't have much time left. As for me, my heart is in a rush. I want to seat Hae Na as the successor and see her settled in marriage. Only then, will I be able to rest in peace. I fired Butler Seo. Tae Yoon, you knew about Butler Seo, didn't you? Yes. I knew. It's for the best, since I didn't like him being with you. So how is it? Since Butler Seo is no longer by your side, does it feel empty? What do you mean? Just? since you two were close. It's okay. He was just a mere butler anyway. I don't know if Butler Seo told you, but I asked him to disappear. Was I too harsh? No, I can certainly understand it from your perspective. But? Nevermind. I think the way it worked out is best for everyone involved. For Tae Yoon, for myself... and... for Butler Seo too. That's right. Let's think of it that way. It's going to be crazy for the time being because of the shopping mall. If only for my grandfather, I feel like I have to do something well. Alright. When I have time, I'll come visit quietly. You know not to come empty-handed, right? Alright. Oh, don't you have to find a new butler? Oh, that... I think for now I'll try it on my own. On your own? Didn't you ask last time whether I really need a butler? Yes, I did. Since it's worked out this way, I figured I'd try it on my own. It's a good idea, right? That's good. I might be late for my meeting. I'll be going now. You'll do it on your own. Director. Have you heard from my oppa, a phone call or anything? No. He didn't go to your house? Of course, he said he would come if he quits, but I haven't heard from him. Very well, then. Just in case, if my oppa calls you, please let me know. Sure, got it. Where in the world has he gone? Just pick up, why won't you pick up the phone? Huh? Eui Joo, I'm going to get some fresh air before I go home. Don't worry. Where are you? Director. Have you heard from my oppa, a phone call or anything? Where is this guy and what the heck is he doing? He hasn't even called. Oppa! Dong Chan, she's been waiting and waiting for you. So you've finished work? Yes. Where were you? I was out and about, on vacation. Some vacation. You didn't even pick up the phone. It was because I didn't get reception. I thought you really weren't coming back! But now that you're here, nice to see you! Yes, this is Flower Garden. Yes, it's ready. I'll bring it to you. - Eui Joo, I'm going to go make a delivery. - See you later! Who asked you for money? I told you to apologize! You're still wet behind the ears, and you're talking down at me?! That girl, I wonder if she'll be okay. Why are we still in the red? With the bonus, the event, we're doing more than other shopping malls. Why are sales still falling? If this fails, do you think it's the end just for me? The entire shopping mall business will be gone. You can't think of a way to raise sales? There is a way? What is it? It's? not quite above-board. What? Why are you here? I thought you'd be having a hard time, so I came by to offer my condolences. You can leave. A 15% increase in one month? Why would you bluff like that? Would you shut it and piss off please? I'm just so busy right now. At a time like this... If you had that Butler Seo giving you useless ideas, it would be even harder for you. Give it your best shot. Grandfather must be counting on you, so this is quite troubling. You said you know a way to raise sales, right? If it's not above-board, then what exactly is it? Dad, what should we have for lunch? What do you think of French? There's a problem. Since a few days ago, sales of primarily high-priced luxury goods have quickly started to rise. What is this? It's already gone up 7%? It doesn't even seem like they've changed their marketing. How could this happen? Hae Na, you really must have worked hard on this. Hang on a minute. Your work has really made this happen? Yes... What should I do? What could you possibly have done to increase sales like that? - Could you let me in on your secret? - Secret? Shall I call it my innate instinct? Instinct? It's not the kind of thing you can learn or teach. I commend you for wanting to learn, but just give it up and go sell some shoes. Sure. Kang Hae Na, I'm not sure what novel trick you pulled, but don't get too excited. I'm quite persistent, you know. You get my drift? Gosh, this is driving me crazy! Butler Seo, if you were here, what would you have said? Agasshi, are you crazy? Come to your senses! It's true, I must be crazy. Hey, at long last, the proposal! Oh, Hyung, you were here? You bought that a while ago, so why haven't you given it to her yet? It just turned out that way. Why, is something wrong with Hae Na? It's not that. I'm planning to give it to her today. Today? Then, what event have you planned? Event? Do I have to do that? I was just going to give her the ring? Listen, you're in for trouble. Do you not understand women at all? If you half-ass the proposal, you're asking for it for the rest of your life. Do you want to live your whole life being mistreated? No, I was just? Just shut up and do what I tell you. Come on. I said, come on! Where are we going? You'll see when we get there. Will you be very late? I'm almost there. It's fine, take your time. Alright. Hey, hey! Hold on! Be careful! Alright, alright. Walk faster! - Ready, go! - I can do it! Don't let go! I won't! Don't let go! Hey, don't let go! Don't let go! Hey! What's wrong with me? I'll help you get married, and I'll pay for your kids' schooling. However, I have to be the first person to meet the woman you're going to marry. Okay? Because you've got a nice streak that makes you susceptible to meeting a bad woman. Like you, Agasshi? Agasshi, I didn't want you to know. Because? I had feelings for you. It's a little awkward, right? It really is a little awkward. I don't usually do these things well, but Su Ho said I had to do it this way. I went above and beyond today in order to propose to you, Hae Na. When I said we should get married, it wasn't a proposal. Today is the real thing. Hae Na, will you marry me? Hae Na? Tae Yoon, I can be honest, right? Go ahead. It's been really hard for me these days. Because of Butler Seo? Are you sure I'm the one you like? Hello? What? Welcome. - I received a phone call that I should come. - Oh, right. This way. The customer has had quite a lot to drink, so we weren't sure we had the right number. It's a relief. Agasshi, what are you doing? Agasshi? Oh! You're? Butler Seo. It's Butler Seo! But what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I came because you called. Me? I didn't... I never called you. I heard you asked them to call your butler so you could go home. No, there's no reason I would do that. Did I? I must have! Am I drunk? Why would I do such a thing? Gosh! Butler Seo, it's nice to see you again. Have a drink. No I'm fine. Get up. I don't want to! You're really not going to get up? No. Agasshi! Butler Seo, how have you been? Huh? What about you? I've been well. Get up. I'll take you home. Why do you keep talking about leaving? I'm just happy to see you, it's been so long. But, Butler Seo, ever since you left? You've gotten cuter. - What are you doing? - So cute! - Let go! - So cute, so cute! What did you do to me just now? I didn't do anything. Really? I didn't do anything? Butler Seo is a vagabond musician. - Butler Seo is a vagabond musician. - Be quiet, people are staring! - What? I don't know, I don't know. - Try to walk straight! I'm walking straight? Ground! Why do you keep moving? This isn't working. I'll piggyback you. - No, it's embarrassing! - You're embarrassed?! Here, get on my back. Take your shoes off. Obediently taking shoes off! - Now get on. - Alright! But I can walk fine. I don't want to hear it. Are you making fun of me? You're fired. I'm already fired. Is that so? But... Agasshi. What? Did something bad happen? No. - Then why did you drink so much? - I didn't drink. Did you fight with Attorney Lee again? Tae Yoon? Tae Yoon... Yes, I fought with Tae Yoon. And... there were lots of things. What happened? You're not my butler, it's not for you to know! You're not my butler, so I'm not telling you anything. That's fine. Since I'm not your butler, I won't listen to anything. Jerk. Who? What do you mean, who? I mean you! It's all your fault. Why is it my fault? Because you're not here, it ended up like this. It's all your fault. Because you're not here. Because you left. Agasshi, are you going through a hard time? I'm not. But what's making it hard? I said it's not! But you're obviously having a hard time. It's not hard! You're not my butler anymore, so don't ask questions. I'm not going to tell you anything. Alright. Since I'm not your butler, I won't ask you anything. Hae Na hasn't come in yet? No, Chairman. This isn't good. Let me know when she gets here. Yes. Oh no, oh no! Agasshi! Water? - Water? I'll go get some water! - Water? Agasshi, wake up. Agasshi? I'm home. When did I get here? Have you regained your bearings? Agasshi, I have to go. I wanted to say one thing before I leave. As for the difficulty you're dealing with... Alright, I won't ask. But how long are you going to keep living so childishly? Drinking, complaining, do you think it suits you? I know it's hard, but all I'm saying is you need to keep your wits about you. What's it to you? You're right. In the future, I won't meddle. That's why, of your own volition, you need to be strong and stand on your own two feet. As Kang Hae Na. Do you understand? Chairman. What happened, exactly? It seems Agasshi was very drunk and gave the wrong number for calling her butler. This is very unfortunate, to cause trouble for you even after you've quit. No, it's fine. Very well. And how are you these days? I've been getting along. I'll be going now. Butler Seo. Yes? There's? nevermind. It's nothing. You should get going. Yes, Sir. No matter how hard I think about this, it's suspicious. How could it increase so quickly? Turns out there's an explanation. Dad, this time, Hae Na's really made a mess of it. Ugh, my stomach? why did I drink?! Su Ah, what brings you here? How tall are your shoes? I heard there would be a spectacle worth seeing, so I thought I'd stop by. Spectacle? What spectacle? Kang Hae Na, as of now, you're officially dead. Chairman, the situation is even more serious than you think. It's fortunate we're not a publicly-traded company, because if we were, there would be no way to avoid a fall in stock market rates. - What? - What are you saying? I bought it with my own money, but are you implying that I was manipulating stocks? Your money? Did you just say it was your money? That's right, I said my money. Did I say anything that wasn't true? Oh dear. Hae Na, how is that your money? It's the Chairman's money. And, even if we were to consider it yours, money isn't something to throw around mindlessly. It's true. Grandfather... Isn't it dangerous to have someone so mindless as the successor of Kangsan Group? Why do you keep trying to start an argument with me? - Do you want me to teach you a lesson? - Hae Na! You and Su Ah, take your leave first. Yes, Chairman, I understand. Grandfather, you saw it too, right? The two of them think I'm a pushover. I swear, if we weren't related? Get out. What? Get out of my house. Grandfather, what are you saying? That I should leave? Pack your things and get out of my house this instant! Grandfather! I can't stand to look at you. You don't even know what you did wrong, and you don't realize how dangerous it was, so how could I entrust Kangsan Group to you? I don't even want to give you a single grain of rice! Grandfather! Butler Jang. Butler Jang! You called? Pack her bags and get Hae Na out of here! Grandfather! Let go! Let go! How could you? Let go! Do you want to get fired? Agasshi, please try to understand. There's nothing we can do. You can't be serious! All of you, take heed. Anyone who gets caught trying to help Hae Na in secret must deal with the consequence. If you get caught helping Hae Na, you'll immediately be fired. Understood? Grandfather! Why are you standing there? Take her outside immediately! Yes, Chairman. Let go! Let go of me! Grandfather! Let go! Let me go! Agasshi, come out. Agasshi, please forgive us. We can only do as the chairman says. Agasshi, take care of yourself! You're not really going to leave me here like this, are you? Hey! Hey! You jerks, how could you leave? God, seriously! Grandfather, you think I'd be scared because you threw me out? Executive suite, please. I'm sorry, but this card has been canceled. What? The card is canceled. Do you have another? This one's canceled, too. This isn't working, either. Gosh, Grandfather! How much would a regular suite be? What about a double superior room? Superior room? Then? a standard room? What about Hae Na? Butler Jung and Butler Lee drove her out. But, Chairman, I'm not sure this was the right decision. With Agasshi's personality, she might get into trouble. Whether or not she does makes no difference to me. She'll figure it out. - Chairman. - That's enough. This time, I've got to tear apart and fix her immaturity, stubbornness, and that attitude. Even if I die when I die, I need to make a person out of her first! What kind of a room is this? Still, it's better than Yeo Eui Joo's cooped up house. Ugh, I'm hungry. Mighty Kang Hae Na can't lose her spirits over this. Gosh, but I'm so hungry. Tae Yoon? Should I call or not? Okay? No, I can't! Oh, Hae Na. Since when do you call? What's going on? Well? just wondering how you're doing. I'm doing well. But I'm really busy. There's too much work. You must be busy. But you still have to eat, right? But there are so many things that are more important than eating. Of course, well in that case? Finish up what you were doing, and, just in case? It couldn't be that Kang Hae Na is asking for money. Is it because you miss me? If that's what you think, you can shut it! Did I really not have any friends? I'm so hungry! Let's try again? Butler Seo. - So cute! - Ahh! No, not him, not after embarrassing myself like that. I'm going to go crazy! Isn't there anything to eat? This is filling. I want to go home. Where am I?
