November 29th, 1924 Five years have passed since the Estonian War of Independence. The Border of Republic of Estonia and Soviet Russia DECEMBER HEAT Tanel! - Yes, what is it, dear? Tanel, pour some water. Quickly! - What? Please pour some water! The water was ice-cold! - Sorry. I told you to let it warm up. Are you warmer now? - No! Damn, I can't live like this. I hate this cold water and misery. Damn it. I was cold throughout the morning shift. When I asked my boss about the heating, he replied if I don't like it at the com-centre I should get a new job. Anna... - I want to get away from here! It's cold and nasty! I don't even have spare tights anymore. - It's payday soon. Let's run away. Travel to Paris. - I can't leave the army like that. And what should we do there? You studied as an architect, you can polish your skills there. Studying costs money. We don't have enough even for train tickets. I know where we could get some. I talked to Indrek. - Behind my back! But you are only gluing your dollhouses! We are not going anywhere. Yes, we are! - No, we're not. Anna, please put it down! - Are we going or not? Please, put the miniature down! - Promise me. Damn you, put it down! How about it, love? - Yes, yes, yes... So we are going? - No, we are not! What!? I'm really going to kill you, Anna! - Are we going? One day you're going to drive me crazy. - What if that's what I want? So are we? I'm going now. - Don't be late. We're eating soon! Good morning, lieutenant R?uk! - Hi, Joosep. Say hello to your dad. - I will! The communist threat has passed! "The Great Trial of 149" announced. Sentenced to life in hard labour - 38! 15 years in hard labour - 28! The communist threat has passed! Did you bring it? - Yeah. Ten pies! - All right then. See you later. - See you. The communist threat has passed! "The Great Trial of 149" announced. Sentenced to life in hard labour - 38. 15 years in hard labour... Hey, kid! Watch it! Fine English stuff. Light enough. Don't play with it! - Don't fret. They're reliable like clockwork. I told you. Reliable like clockwork! All right. Hey, its not enough. Remember, we haven't met! Estonian Consulate in Leningrad November 29th Where's your conscience? You bastards! Well, comrade. How was your vacation, comrade Kuusinen? - Great, comrade Zinovjev. I went fishing as you suggested. - So, how are they biting? Well enough for November. Be careful not to catch any of the small ones. Don't worry. As you can see, things are going well here also. Cheap, yet looks convincing. Drive! Tallinn, Republic of Estonia The Ministry of Defence Death to fascists with general's shoulder straps Straight to the Tallinn garrison! This is the simplest rifle. Of course, you recognise it. Familiar, isn't it? You use it while reloading... may take time. I'll show you again. And from here you can put one by one... Let's proceed. That's a Mauser. The Tallinn Garrison Gen. Unt, I'm fed up with inactivity! - You are dismissed. Why don't you do something? It's your duty as the Head of the Tallinn Garrison! You're lecturing me? - Why do you allow those rebels to provoke the people in the middle of the city? The stench of commies is everywhere! General, you as a brilliant tactician should understand the importance of proper timing. Think about it. I'll bring my division to Tallinn. - General P?dder! You'll do no such thing or you'll be court marshaled. But do stay in Tallinn for a few days and calm your nerves. Take it as... an order! Calm my nerves... Come and eat, Joosep. How long do we have to wait? Heavenly Father, we thank you for the food you have given us today. Watch over us and our loved ones. Watch over our country and its people. We ask this on today's Sunday... Pick it up and kiss the bread. - Why should I kiss it? Because bread is God's gift. - How can it be a God's gift if you are a baker and all you do is bake bread? Do as your father told you and pick up the bread. Good Lord! - Pick it up and put it on the table. And the bread also. The Tondi Military School That's a hopper. Feeding is done from the back to the front. The hopper is placed here. They say that the Americans already have a new type of weapon. You'd like the one that lets you hide as the gun does all the fighting. You have to be careful with this one. It tends to jam. But otherwise it is a good instrument. I think this equipment should be declared scrap iron. It served us with honour during the War of Independence. All right, you can come out now. - He's as stubborn as you are. I was never that stubborn. Excuse me. May I have this dance? Look. The boys are there. - Oh yeah. Russia is picking a fight with Poland again. Name me one country Russia is not picking a fight with! What do you think of the outcome of "The Trial of 149"? Stop with the politics. We have a training on Monday. Let us party. - Let's discuss theatre. Did you see Liina Reimann in "The Maid of Orleans"? Saw who? - Oh, hello! You talk about theatre when there's no money to buy the tickets. The wages have been suspended! - Is this a funeral? For the night, all drinks are on me, but I don't want to see a sad face. If your father could see how you're squandering away his factory, how many times would he turn in his grave? - Who knows. The factory is like a huge stone around my neck. The faster I get rid of it, the faster I'll be back in the army. Let us get started then... Cheers! Hello, comrades! - Hello! Is everyone here? - Yes. When do we begin? I'll let you know. Meanwhile, don't let anybody out, right? Mr. Head of State, permission to address? What is it, general? - I have to inform you that as an old trench-wolf, I smell trouble. - Thank you Mr. P?dder for sharing your concerns with us, but today we party. I hope that you'll participate. We'll talk about your worries tomorrow. You can even lock me up but I have to talk about my concern immediately! General, don't embarrass yourself. Open up! Hello, comrades! - Hello! Everyone present? - Yes. But the men haven't eaten the whole day. They're grumbling! - You came here to eat? Not exactly... - I'll send for something. Remember, nobody can leave. - Clear enough. Did you hear about the wages, R?uk? Nasty, isn't it? Well, one should tighten his belt. - Tighten one's belt? What a wuss you've become. Look at those fat hogs partying at the expense of the people. Lieutenant, get one cadet to help you and take general P?dder home. Affirmative! But there are plenty of petty officers. - Again, they put you in your place? Why do you have to go... The lieutenant's job is to shut up and follow orders, while the top brass is having fun. - Anna, I'll be back soon... It's not my place to discuss the orders. Jaan, I missed you. Is everything ready? Don't use names. Call me the Lawyer. My horsey is waiting at the door. Beautiful, with four... Hi! See you! Anna, come with us. Let's see how fast my car can drive. I can't. I have got work tomorrow. My condolences. Au revoir, madam. But we, Liisi, Lonni... I'm Lonni. - And I'm Liisi. Hush now! I'm paying and I say how the things are. Let's go, girls! Pay attention where you walk! Walk on the sidewalk. Quiet! If my missus wakes up we'll have a disaster at hand. Listen up, sonnies. Don't mind if I'm straightforward like an old soldier. There are complete jackasses at helm of the Estonian military forces. Some slick-haired careerists who have never even smelled the gunpowder, hiding away in provisions duty. Shit. That's that. I wanted to say this to the Head of State but was denied. But all the while the communists are jawing away at the parliament, no one will shut them up. Look at me, an old trench-wolf, I have with my one two hands wasted the reds and the yellows and a shitload of barons at V?nnu. Is brushed away like some brat. Shit. The border woudn't even hold a hippo and yet they're surprised. "We know nothing. We don't have the time." "We want to munch brownies." Were you in the War of Independence? You were? And yet you're still a lieutenant! To hell with it! Learn yourself a good profession, go fat and make a houseful of babies. My dove... Our regards, ma'am. We have to leave. You can stand up to the general but not to the general's wife. Then things are not looking well for you. Well, you Finnish pig! We've already buried 300,000 marks in Estonia! Where has this money gone? - The money was spent where necessary. On what? - We've bought weapons, fake clothes, done propaganda work in the Estonian army. Spread fliers, undermined the authority of leadership. Revolutionary ideas among the soldiers are growing. Thanks to our propaganda the leading generals of the army P?dder, Unt and Laidoner were recently accused of plotting a fascist coup. I want to know, is anybody doing any real work? Anna! - You. What are you... It's me alright. - Sorry, I have to go. Wait, are you still angry with me? There's no need! I can explain! Don't bother. - I know you have the right to be mad. But damn, it was a long time ago. How are you and what are you doing here? I live here. And I'm doing very well. I got married and I work at the telegraph and... Quickly now! Don't be afraid, they're workers. We're helping a guy move. You are a worker? - A worker is not a human being? I don't believe you're a worker. - Anna, soon you'll see how... You are hurting me! - Wait! Let's make up. For old times sake. My husband is there. I started to think about... What is it? - Nothing, a stranger asked me the time. Maybe going away is not such an impossible task. Comrade Chief of Intelligence, how are you doing? By now, more than a hundred specially trained fighters have arrived to Tallinn. They are led by experienced communists. The same communists who established Soviet rule in Tbilisi, Yerevan and Baku. There are more than 5000 fighters at the border ready to invade Estonia. Now this kind of talk I can understand. That's good. I'm fed up with this Republic of Estonia. It's a historical error, a mere fiction. Sure. Still, that fiction may demonstrate some resistance. With the Western support, comrade Berzins. Fortunately, they have no business with us. The subdual of Estonia doesn't even endanger our treaty with England. Provided that we put on a little show. Everything is ready. Our people are only waiting for the signal. Further delay is dangerous. - You'll get your signal. But I repeat: the work must be clean and reflect the will of the Estonian people unambiguously. Understood? - Loud and clear, comrade Zinovjev. A special telegram from Tallinn will see to that. Is that so? That is excellent. Berzins, you're a Latvian, right? - Yes. And you, Kuusinen, you're a Finn, aren't you? - Yes. Not bad. Tallinn, November 30th The commission shop You have to be patient, comrade. They're making a world revolution in there. Bloody kindergarten! Don't you think there are enough pins? - Possibly. Another soldier was lost at the border. Several conspiratorial apartments have been discovered. Something has to be done. Don't disturb the apartments yet. Nerves, lad. Why did Napoleon win at Austerlitz? For three weeks we've been busy with sticking pins into the map. I'm forced to report your inaction. - Let's make it clear, captain! Containing communists rests upon me, I'm responsible. Only I will tell when we open our cards. Tallinn, the telegraph centre Anna. - What is it? I've got a surprise for you! - I'm working. Let's talk at home tonight. Wait! I bought the train tickets. What tickets? - To Paris! But we didn't have any money. - Yeah, about that... Honey, I... - You sold my coat? My dearest thing! The only thing that you ever gave me! How could you!? It's much warmer in Paris. One day I'll buy you a wardrobe full of coats. You're right. Let's go. Leningrad, the Comintern command centre December 1st Pass it onto the Soviet embassy in Tallinn... and they meet here... Regretfully, we have to inform you that your aunt has died today at 5.15. Comrades! The revolution has begun. Let us prepare ourselves. R?uk, you're one sleepless guy. Who's travelling to Paris at this hour? Quit your whining. An order is an order. - Especially an order given by a wife. After me, comrades! Go, go, go! Quietly! Tallinn, the Baltic Railway Station If you make it in Paris, then I'll follow you. I've tough times here at the factory. The workers are constantly on strike! Dear Anna... Take care of yourself. Get a move on before I start weeping. Wait, I'll say goodbye to the guys. - Okay. R?uk! And without his uniform! Planning to lead the troops in your coat, are you? Anna hid his uniform or he inherited a fortune and hired Indrek as his driver. No, guys. He's leaving for Paris. With his wife. For good. I resigned from the army yesterday. Who goes to Paris with his own wife!? Tallinn, the Estonian Parliament If it goes on like this, the Republic will be depleted of men. Let the lad go. Soon he'll be back penniless. Good morning, men! - Good morning! So, whisking off the dust of the potato republic from your feet. Wise move, there's nothing here. - Screw you, Veidesoo, don't you start with your whining. - Did I say something wrong? Haggling and trickery are running rampant. The speculants and manufacturers have fattened themselves up on our money! Baker! Leave your pies! Let's go and bring down the bourgeois government. Men, look at your uniforms! A disgrace! Turn your back so you can't see how a worker from Kassisaba is starving. If his father wouldve left him a factory, he'd shit on the workers! He'd drive a limo with pretty gals. Mad from envy. - Jokers! Once the first shot rings out, you'll all shit yourselves. That does it! The Tondi Military School Upstairs! What is going on? - A rebellion has begun in the city. What rebellion? - Goddamn reds! The Telegraph Centre Bloody hell! Everybody down! What are you staring at? Didn't you hear me? Down. Nobody moves! I'll shoot you. Down onto the ground. Get down! Stay quiet! Fascists! Nobody moves! What are you staring at? Piss off! Maam, let me shoot off a few. I have a customer! - No matter. Prepare a bowl with cold water. That's an order! Excuse me, you may continue. The homeland won't forget your services. Come here! Who do you think you are? Stop it! Don't bother. Let the prick be! - Apologise! Easy, gentlemen, easy! - If I had a gun, I'd shoot the crap out of him. - Leave it. Half of my factory is filled with whiners like him. Stop it. Let him be. Hands up! Get back towards the lounge! Move it! Move it! Put your hands up! Hands up! Down! Don't move! Comrades officers! The power belongs now to the working people. Screw you! Now, remove your greatcoats and boots. Move it! Move it! Move it! Quickly! Like in the army! Move it! Move it! - Take off your boots! If anyone tries anything, I'll shoot! Stop the train! - What is it? My husband was left behind! - The train is already moving! Comrade Lawyer! Well, bourgeois. Why are you going to the training exercise with a gun when others don't? I'm joining your side. Give me back my gun. Why should I trust you? Because the Republic of Estonia hasn't kept her pledge. It relieves me of mine. There are a lot of people like you today. Sarv! Hold it! I'm the Minister of Transportation Kark, what is going on here? A pleasure, Minister. There's been a change of power in your state. You wouldn't dare. Soon you'll see. You. Get up! - What is this bloody mess? Here you go, here is your exam. - You are a beast! Anna, do you want to live? - You are with them? Not only am I with them, I also run the show here. Good! Let us continue. Please. What kind of fucking charade are you pulling here? Lieutenant, what are you... I knew this country would go down like a house of cards. Traitors are not tolerated anywhere. We're not a bunch of robbers. We are revolutionaries! We do not kill, we hand out justice. If you are loyal to the revolution, you will not be executed. I will give you an hour to think this through. Men! Help! Damn it! Surrender, you commie bastard, or well throw a grenade! It's me, general P?dder! You two stay and guard the post office! You come with me, quickly! Let's go! Keep the station till we come to power. You'll answer with your head. That kid... Run, Tanel! You! Get up. Let's go, loverboy. Just hold me... if only you can. Tallinn, the 5th Police Precinct It's locked! - Shoot the lock open! Surrender! The city is under the command of the working class. - Shut your hole! Retreat behind the cart! You go right now and hide with Joosep! - Come one, Joosep. Aim at the windows! - Preserve the ammo! This is still the Republic of Estonia! You and you on me. Others will stay here! Preserve your ammo. You bastard! Help! Get the thief! You! Come with me. You! Stay here! Watch the front door! Wait here! Julius! - Go away! You go and hide Joosep! Let me go! Let me go! I won't surrender. I didn't surrender it at Narva, I won't surrender it here. Dad! Hold it! Since when is the revolution being done in a limo? What is going on here? - Everything is fine here. Excellent. Where are the weapons? Bring the weapons to the car. Quickly! Out! Out! Out! Easy! Easy! Don't touch me! Let me go! - Easy! Easy! What is she doing here? - That's not your concern. Faster! To the car, quickly! General! - Who are you? Lieutenant R?uk! Remember? We sat with you the day before yesterday. I remember! Why aren't you in a uniform? - I left the army like you suggested. Did I give you such stupid advice when our fatherland is in danger? Julius! Julius! My dear Julius! Please open your eyes. Everything is going to be okay... Please open your eyes. We lost the railway station. Estonian officers are being held captive. Bring men from the Ministry of Defence and follow me! Let's recapture the station. - I can't. What do you mean you can't. - They took my wife with them. Damn it. Fatherland always comes second. If you see someone, send them to help me. - Affirmative, general. Straight to the Baltic railway station! The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia Go ahead! Get your weapons! Report! - We're trapped! I noticed. Lock and load! Set off the bomb! Here! - Bomb! Get down! We hold the power! Bloody rebel! - I'm an Estonian officer! Let's go! I haven't seen a uniform like this before. - You have now. Men, women, working people, listen up! The hour is finally upon us! How long will you allow the bourgeois to rob you blind? The proletarians in all the countries are brothers and will help one another. Why some are masters while others are still slaves? The people are with us.. Soon it'll be over. Anna, listen... We are not butchers. It's necessary to set up the barricades. It's necessary to get as much people on the streets as possible! Tell them to leave their benches and come with us! Anna, what happened to you? You used to be different. I was a high school girl who wanted to better the world... And now you are a fancy bourgeois lady in a fur-coat! Lowlife, you call me bourgeois! You are a murderer! If you knew how a fur-coat can ruin a persons life you wouldn't talk like that. When a coat was stolen in my school, I was made a culprit, because I was the poorest kid in the class! - You lie! We're in a stolen car, you stole the coat and you're a thief. A murderer! Am I interrupting something?! Four men will go and block the street! The rest of the men will go inside. Use the furniture to build barricades! - Let's move! Move! Faster! Cover me! Cover! People, stand up against the oppressors. Working people, your country is six-years old... - Anna. White bread is not for you! The greedy statesmen and factory owners are fattening themselves and their lackeys with white bread. The bastards have taken the Ministry of Defence. Come! Here! - Wait Stop! Go back right now! Now! Or I'll shoot! On my word! I'm gonna shoot you both. I will cut you down! I'm an officer of the Republic of Estonia. He's a fireman. I have to get to the Ministry of Defence! Who the hell can tell you apart tonight!? Shit! Good, good. Sit. Come with me! The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia Toompea, the Baltic Railway Station, the Ministry of Defence, and the home of the Head of State are ours. The telegraph centre remains untaken. It is a minor setback. As a whole, its according to the plan. What do you think you're doing? - Why keep the bourgeois stuff. Where the hell did you find those jackasses? Only a little more and it's over. - First, the telegram must be sent. Who is this? Not important. A political prisoner. A beautiful political prisoner. Leave her alone. Who is she to you? Who? Answer me, you bastard. Go back to the post office and send the telegram. Right now. Stay low and avoid the windows. He got two bullets in the back. The bastards threw a bomb at us. Destroyed the hallway floor. - How many men have you got? Five, with this one. - How many Russians? Excuse me, I'm a Russian. Over there are the communists. Maam, you are not allowed here! Do you remember Viktor Kingissepp? That is for my husband! The Border of Republic of Estonia and Soviet Russia Anna. Join our cause. - I will never do that! I'll ask nicely at first. The army will enter soon and everything will be ours. I promise you, you'll get anything you want. Everything is okay. We have to attack at once! - What? Under the machine gun fire? Damn it, are you afraid? - My forefathers stood against Batu Khan! So choose your words carefully! I know how we can get there! Don't stand in the way. The world revolution will sweep mercilessly her enemies aside. Remember, this is only the beginning. Soon the red flags will fly over Berlin and Paris. Over London and Warsaw. He who is not with us, is against us and will suffer the revolutionary justice. Those who join us will be welcomed as brothers. What position did they offer you? - What are you talking about? I want nothing. All damned capitalists should be killed! I will be satisfied with no less than a stationmasters position. But I'll hand out everything they've carried together. That's the job Id do my whole life. - Actually a business manager... Shit! Shoot the bourgeois! Go and save your woman! Workers! The reign of capitalists and oppressors has collapsed. The rule of the working people will take over! Instead of factory owners and grey barons Estonia will be... The revolt has been suppressed everywhere. All the rebels are ordered to stop resistance and surrender. This is a provocation! Squad, assault! March! March! I'll ask you nicely for the last time. The moment we dreamt together is here. I want us to do this together. Little Jass wants his candy but the lady won't let him. Go and tell your mommy. I've always wondered what's the disease people like you suffer. I just got it. This would be interesting to hear... - You're simply shitty guys. Small fellows who think people always bully them and that's why they kill. Fine, I'll tell who you are. You're lice who feed on the blood and sweat of the people and you should be simply destroyed. Where's Anna? - Why is this bitch so important to you? The military school, the Parliament and the railway station have been retaken. Where are those 2000 soldiers who were supposed to come? There's no working class to be seen. What the hell have you been organising here for the last two years? Let's go to the post office and send the telegram. An old acquaintance. We glued silly posters to the walls when we were kids. No matter. What telegram? A call for help to Russia. Then the army will come. Wait! Where are you going? - Wait for me, I'll be back. Forward... Wait, reloading! Let's go! - Wait for me! Send the telegram. It's of utmost importance! Go, damn you. Go now! Put the weapon down, you fucking communist! Put it down. Easy now. Faster, damn you! Put the enemies at the back of the wagon... Why the hell are you standing here? General! - What is it? The rebels are heading for the telegraph to send a telegram. Go and guard the door. Sit. Lets send the telegram. Connection established. To the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Estonian proletariat... has cast off the yoke of capitalism. Let's continue. To start building socialism. Stop. The working class is in power in Estonia. But knowing the hatred of imperialistic powers... against the freedom... of proletariat, we beseech... Damn idiot! Why did he stop! Move aside! Why did you stop? Your timing ability is legendary! Did he manage to escape? Not important. His own people will take care of him in Russia. Tanel! - Anna! Damn bungler! We beseech you... We beseech you not to stick your nose into the business of free peoples. Stop. Incidentally, we ask you to drown the plotters of the recent coup into the Moscow river... as it is a Russian tradition from the time immemorial. Full stop. Well-well, General Unt is out at the crack of dawn. Are you out exercising? - Calm yourself, General. I'll explain everything. - Bastard! Didn't I tell you that the reds are up to something? What kind of a game are you playing? - You can call that a game if you like, but I'd call it a calculated risk The fate of the state was depending upon that one telegram! We let them crawl out of their holes and remove their masks. So we could squash them. - Suck it! Hell, I won't sue you. I told you to stay in Tallinn. Why do you think that was? I was depending on you. Take a picture of the hero! Let's go and have a drink! Look, that's our suitcase. - I'll bring your coat. Our train leaves in fifteen minutes. Our tickets should be valid. - Of course they are. I desperately crave for a cigarette. - Me too. Let's sit down before we go. How did you get out of that cupboard? - What cupboard? Oh, forgive me. Paris will be lovely for sure. - Yes, definitely. The whole Paris is waiting for us. It's probably warm there. - It's warm all the time. People don't have a care in the world. There are accordionists and dancing people everywhere. But we are drinking absinthe. You wish. We are going to dance till we drop. Well? Are you going? - Enough of Paris for this time. Say what? - Well, you see... Let's go home! The world revolution was stopped that night in Tallinn, 67 years remained until the collapse of the Soviet empire.
