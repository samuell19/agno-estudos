Lee Kang To is next to the Commander. Don't shoot carelessly. Cover me. Stay still! Step on it. Harder! Alright. Lee Kang To! Hand the Commander over to us! Don't do it! Abe, Takeda! Catch that b****! Hurry! Hurry! That was a close one. If it hadn't been for you, it really could've been a disaster. What happened? We were suddenly shot at. You don't know how worried I was, thinking we were going to lose Dam Sa Ri. How'd those bastards know Damsari's transport and attack? I should've foreseen that they'd be guarding the way to the penitentiary. the way to the penitentiary. the way to the penitentiary. They are so fast. I'm sorry, Superintendent. Don't worry. Rats are always caught. Put Dam Sa Ri in the car. Lieutenant Sato. Stay behind and take care of this mess. Abe, Kagawa, go get Dam Sa Ri. Yes! Here are the instructions for his execution. No need. Aren't you going to the penitentiary? Superintendent! We're going to go back to the Jong Ro Police Station. Did you get permission from the Chief? Sato Hiroshi, are you too busy loving a traitor's daughter to be able to recognize your superior? As a Imperial Police Officer, I can't forgive you for stepping out of line. Superintendent, you, yourself, shouldn't cross the line as a Imperial Officer. Dam Sa Ri's transport was ordered by the Chief. Abe! Kagawa! Fix things here. Yes! Let's go. Superintendent... Put him in the torture chamber. Yes! Superintendent, will you be alright? Make sure Lee Kang To and Dam Sa Ri don't come in contact. Also, Oh Mok Dan? Hurry. So no one catches on. Alright. (Japanese) Bridal Mask Come in. Episode 17. While we were transporting Dam Sa Ri to the Seo Dae Moon Penitentiary, we were attacked by the remnants of Dam Sa Ri's group. Fortunately, we prevented him from escaping, but the 9 officers who'd been transporting him have all died. What did you say? What we need to worry about is that those bastards still have a lot of explosives and ammunition. What are you talking about? Those delinquents have explosives? The day before the Korea-Japan Annexation Commemoration, Those delinquents have explosives? The day before the Korea-Japan Annexation Commemoration, the bastards stole from the armory at the Jong Ro Police Station. What did you say? Do we really need to publicly execute Dam Sa Ri when things are like this? Many people will gather. What'll you do if the remnants of Dam Sa Ri's gang set off an explosive to rescue him? What'll you do if the remnants of Dam Sa Ri's gang set off an explosive to rescue him? Public execution? Didn't you approve it? Superintendent Kimura brought Dam Sa Ri back to the station. That bastard! Call Superintendent Kimura! A superintendent ignores my word? When I definitely said that we can't publicly execute him!? Lieutenant Sato, put this bastard in a holding cell at once! I command the emergency arrest of Kimura Shunji, whose rank is only superintendent, for ignoring the command of his superior. Quickly! I bat my fate on catching Bridal Mask. If you say you'll arrest me, do you think I'll give up? The fate of a bastard like you is above the Government General's fate? Lieutenant Sato, what are you doing? Put this arrogant bastard in a holding cell at once! Yes! Sato Hiroshi, stay out of this. Until you approve a public execution, I can't take even one step from here. Sato Hiroshi! Let's go. This is Konno Goji. Chief Konno! Let's execute the terrorist and traitor, Mok Dam Sa Ri, publicly in front of the people of the penninsula. (Joseon people) Your Excellency. Are you being serious right now? If the League of Nations finds out about this, Japan's justification for annexing Joseon, in order to modernize it, will become a joke! A barbaric public execution? Your Excellency, Japan is a law-governed county! Do you think I'd order a public execution without preparing for that kind of backlash? Stop nagging and just do as you're told! Your Excellency...Your Excellency! A mere superintendent puts the Chief of Police in his place? Even Chief Kimura has been dismissed. Who the heck is behind Shunji's power? Sato Hiroshi, take off these handcuffs. In 5 days, Dam Sa Ri's public execution will be held at the Kyeong Seong station square. Thank you for approving, Chief. I ordered them loudly, but Chief Konno's words are a hundred percent correct. Now, the Manchukuo we established is being criticized as a puppet government by the League of Nations, If the foreign press knows about it, Your Excellency, isn't the League of Nations always on the side of the more powerful? Well. . . Of course that's true. Honestly, I want to personally gouge out the flesh and break the bones of the bastard who bombed the Korea-Japan Annexation Commemoration, and kill him. However, I can't do that. So don't worry and just leave it to the Joseon advisors. You sent for me? Sit. Why were you in such a rush to transport Dam Sa Ri? According to the evidence so far also and since I saw the remnants of Dan Sa Ri's gang tried to kill you before, I'm sure you're not working with Dam Sa Ri. But. . . The timing was too perfect. You rushed the transport and of all things, the remnants of Dam Sa Ri's group attack the transport vehicle? I find it suspicious, so I'm just telling you. I heard you telling the Chief that Dam Sa Ri should be publicly executed. Like the Chief, I hold the opposite opinion. Since the Joseon General Government announced the new law, there is widespread discontent among the Joseon people. If there is a riot, by any chance, like the Manse Demonstrations [of March 1, 1919], how will you handle that? Is that the only reason you rushed? I didn't want Mok Dan to see that. How could I let her see her father being killed publicly in front of all those people? So even though you knew he'd be killed as soon as he got to the penitentiary, you rushed to transport him? You know it too. No matter how much His Excellency, the Governor General, rushes to execute him, there needs to be another trial for his crime of bombing the Korea-Japan Annexation Commemoration. You need to at least let him stand at another trial. You're just going to execute him because he's already been sentenced to death? My thoughts differ from Chief Konno and you. Dam Sa Ri would be rat poison strong enough to not only get rid of Bridal Mask and the remnants of the independence movement, but also the rumors that are spreading amongst the Joseon people. Do you mean I should throw that precious rat poison into the sewer? Yes, this is Superintendent Kimura. Superintendent! We moved her here as you ordered. Alright. I'll go there now. Don't go anywhere. Guard her. Shunji definitely snuck Mok Dan out. He openly violated Chief Konno's order and now he's even sneaking people out of the holding cell as he pleases? Since when did Kimura Shunji become so powerful? Shunji, who the hell is supporting you from behind? Move! Is this the Asuka Hotel? Please connect me to the Suite 501. Esther, are you ok? Just now, I just retrieved your father, who was on his way to the Seo Dae Moon Penitentiary. His Excellency, the Governor General wants him executed immediately. So he was going to be executed as soon as he reached the penitentiary. Because Lee Kang To rushed to transport him, I had to suffer a bit, but fortunately I was able to bring him back again. Lee Kang To? Even though he knew he'd be executed, he rushed to transport him? By any chance, you didn't believe that Kang To loves you, right? Am I crazy? Chief Konno and Kang To want to figure out so many things from Dam Sa Ri. If you continue to be in jail, in the end, your father will open his mouth. Continuing to remain steadfast while your child dies... You heard him too. The sound of your father crying. For your father and for you, I can only do things like this. Please don't try to run away and just stay here. That's how you can help your father. I'll do my best to at least block his execution. Please believe me. Alright? Believe you? Do you know how my mother was treated by others wearing the same uniform as you? When I was 7 years old, I climbed over a wall of the police substation to follow the policemen who hauled away my mom. In order to get my mother to reveal my father's location to them, they'd beat her all night until she fainted. When she fainted,they branded her! They'd tied her up to the rope of the welland dunked her in the well. In front of my mother, who was submerged in the dark well, they'd hung me up in front of her. The bastards, who, laughingly, threatened to drop me in, were the beasts wearing the same Imperial Police Uniform as you. And ... You want me to believe you? Esther. I ... For you, in order to protect you . . . In order to rescue you, I put on the Imperial Police Uniform. You also know that Bridal Mask killed my older brother! If I just catch Bridal Mask, I could take off the Imperial Police Uniform right away! I want to take it off, but... I also want to take this uniform off and teach students! I really want to live like that! Please. There's nothing I... I want nothing from you now. After I saw you saying that you'd go into the nail cage... I. . . I decided not to even ask you who Bridal Mask is. I just... want you to be safe and for you to be at my side. Can't you even do that? When my father is in jail... When even at this moment, he's probably being beaten by Jap bastards... You want me to safely sit here? Am I your plaything?! Takeda! Handcuff her! Don't let her take even one step out of this room! Guard her thoroughly! Yes! Put 2 or 3 more officers on guard. I understand. In this emergency situation, he's going around hiding a wench? What do you want? When you publicly execute Dam Sa Ri, the second Manse demonstration may break up. His Excellency, the Governor General, is extremely worried. Something like that won't happen. Superintendent Kimura, you've continuously lost Bridal Mask. This time you must be certain. I will not allow any more mistakes. I, myself, cannot allow any more mistakes. Good. Now can we talk about something personal? Since your plan failed, you need to give me back the fish I caught. Don't rashly declare that my plan failed. In the trap you set, instead of Bridal Mask, didn't Lee Kang To unfairly get caught? From the beginning, that trap was set to capture Lee Kang To. Not Bridal Mask. So do you have proof that Lee Kang To is Bridal Mask? Just the fact we can be sure that Lee Kang To is not Bridal Mask makes that trap more than worth it. Fine. Anyway, I want the fish I caught returned. Why are you being so stubborn about that wench? Because you, Superintendent Kimura, still are holding that wench in your heart. Kishokai's rising star has been blinded by a worthless Joseon wench? Shouldn't I, at least, assist Superintendant Kimura? Ueno Rie, if you touch even a hair on that wench's body, you'll die by my hands. What did you say? I'm warning you. Don't touch Oh Mok Dan. Foolish bastard. Because of one trivial Joseon wench, you're going to ruin a great endeavor? Great endeavor? Oh. The ambition to rule the Far East and Pacific Ocean? Do you fight to get that? Isn't that why you're putting your life on the line? You're a very pitiful woman. Did Ra Ra approach me intentionally? I know he is my boss but... Hits me at the slightest provocation. Just because he's well-connected... Hey! Oh Mok Dan! This wench! Don't move! -Really, this... -Takeda! You almost lost her. Be on standby. Yes. What? I understand. Keep watching him. Superintendent. I've been told that Lee Kang To is with Oh Mok Dan now. What? You. . . said you would help my father escape? I'm crazy, I placed my hope on your word. Spirit from Hell! Demon! I believed a cannibal who hunts and eats freedom fighters? Crazy bitch. . . I'm a crazy bitch. You're also a Joseon person. . . How can you take advantage of a person's heart when he is trapped in an animal's cage and only wants to survive? I. . . You. . . I thought you died. You. . . If there were even the slightest chance. . . that you were alive, I would've recognized you a little sooner. Boon Yi. . . Can't you recognize me? That knife. . . the one that gave you the knife. . . Young. . . Don't you recognize me? Father, can we take this child? Whose knife is this? No, it's mine. My knife. . . My knife. . . Wait a moment. I'll be right back. Boon Yi. Goodbye Day. Time please stop. ♪So the guilt I feel for the crime of letting you go doesn't hurt. Boon Yi. Boon Yi. ♪My heart always races when I think of you. ♪My heart has already run to you. ♪Your face, which I yearn for, always lingers. ♪You repeatedly fill my eyes. Goodbye Day. ♪ Time please stop. ♪So the guilt I feel for the crime of letting you go doesn't hurt. Hyung. . . Boon Yi! Boon Yi! Lee Kang To... the one that caught my father. . . and had him sentenced to death. . . That Lee Kang To. . . Is the young master? The one that wants to catch the freedom fighters, Imperial Police's Lee Kang To. . . Is the one I have been waiting for. . . The young master. Is that what you're saying? To catch Bridal Mask. . . Caught me and tortured me, that Lee Kang To. . . Made me stand at the middle of the square and tried to kill me, that Lee Kang To? The one who said that he would find me if I just stayed alive. . . That young master? How? How could you be the young master? It's a lie, right? Tell me it's a lie! The young master. . . How could he turn out to be a person like you? I. . . The young master. . . I thought he would be Bridal Mask. The one that saves Joseon people. . . I thought he would be Bridal Mask. The Spirit from Hell who hunts and eats freedom fighters... is the young master, you say? Listen to me. Get out! Get out, right now! How terrible I've been lived, I realize it so painfully now. I said get out! Boon Yi. . . Please, believe in me. I really tried to help your father escape. I don't have much time. Please tell me where to go to meet the comrades. Tell me. I told you to get out! Sato Hiroshi, didn't you hear her say to get out? Count! Yes? Since you're going to a meeting, I think it'll be better to look serious. Change into this, Count. Okay. Even the weather is gloomy... For what important matter is he calling an emergency meeting? You're the Governor General's advisor. The Governor General must need your advice. What advisor? It's not like I have a lot of power or a good pay. What? What? How could you say such horrid things? If it is the House of the Councilor of the Advisory, That's the highest title a Joseon person can get. Can't you tell by the component of the members? All of them are from high rank, and they are big shots who have influence in Joseon. Influential person? True. I am an influential person. Whether they're in Kyeong Seong or in the rural areas, every bastard who passes gas is going crazy because they want to be an advisor. Aigo. When you know so well! Here. Don't tremble or be nervous. Don't doze off. Alright? Honey, honey. Don't go anywhere and stay home. I'll be right back. Alright. Go! His Excellency, the Governor General is entering. Aigoo. Today's topic is how we unify Japan and Joseon together which has been a problem for the last 20 years since Japan-Korea Annexation, We hope all you advisors will speak freely. I think we need to get rid of racial discrimination more than anything else. Instead of treating them like second class citizens, the Joseon people need to be treated like Japanese citizens... What's more important than that is that all the people of the peninsula (Joseon people) need to arm themselves with the spirit of the Japanese, Your Excellency. That's right! According to Choonwon Lee Kwang Soo saying, if we prick Joseon people's head with a needle, as much as Japanese blood comes out from there. All of Joseon people must have Japanese spirit. In order to do that, first... You need to ban thelanguage the stupid Joseon people use! They need to speak Japanese, Your Excellency. President Park! The more urgent issue is the people who are being swayed by Bridal Mask and Dam Sa Ri... Who dares to agree with the traitors? If there are Joseon people who do so, they should be shot mercilessly! That's right! That's it! At this time, I suggest that Dam Sa Ri, who set off an explosive at the Comemmoration of the Korea-Japan Annexation be publicly executed, Your Excellency. I agree with Count Lee's opinion! I second the motion! Public execution? How can the peaceful nation of Japan commit such a barbaric act in the middle of Kyeong Seong? Do you think that makes any sense? Your Excellency! By getting rid of rioters who doesn't know the right thing, we have to prevent the guiltless sacrifice of innocent citizens. Your Excellency! Yes. It is the proper way to handle it in this extraordinary emergency. We actively recommend the public execution of Mok Dam Sa Ri. We agree! Your Excellency, please make a brave decision. If that's what all of you advisors want, for the maintenance of the public order and to establish legality in the Joseon people's minds, let's punish him as a warning to others! Thank you, Your Excellency! Abe. Nothing's happened! Get out. Lieutenant. You can't come into the torture chamber. I understand. I'll leave. I'll be outside. On the road to the penitentiary, I saw you rescue my comrade from almost dying. Even though you're acting as a Japanese agent, you're also a Joseon person. In four days, in front of the Kyeong Seong Trainstation Square, you'll be publicly executed. I... promised Boon Yi that I'd help you escape. I can't do it alone. Please tell me where your comrades are. Even if you went, do you think my comrades would believe you? Leave that to me. While trying to rescue you, one more of your people was killed. So that that death wasn't in vain, I want to save you. Please tell me where your comrades are. Don't plan something unfeasible. I can no longer watch young people die while trying to save me. They are not dying in vain. As you told me, they are breaking a boulder with eggs. Public Execution of Mok Dam Sa Ri, tenaciously heinous criminal Bridal Mask. Bridal Mask. Geum Hwa Jeong Superintendent Kimura still has that wench in his heart. Are you saying, you didn't know? That is not the case. These days, Kimura Shunji is being much more cool-headed than his brother Kenji. How can you be so ignorant. . . Superintendent Kimura has no interest in conquering this continent or even the Far East. The only thing that makes his heart burn is that trivial Joseon wench. Then, are you telling me to kill that wench? On the contrary. That wench, I will be the one to kill her. You should just keep watch over your son who will go crazy once he finds that wench died. I understand. Please sit. You should watch her die right here, personally. Sister, I told you we would meet again, right? Chief Kimura. Please tell your son. That he should risk his life for power. Not love, which could change at any time. Katsuyama. Kill her. Run away, now! Episode 18 will air next wednesday.
