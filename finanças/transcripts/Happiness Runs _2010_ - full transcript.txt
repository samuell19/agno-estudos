[MUSIC PLAYING] [FILM ROLL] [MUSIC - BONNIE DOBSON, "WINTER'S GOING"] FEMALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO): Those of us who first started living together, instead of having our own small, old-style family units, were surprised how well it went. We thought we'd have many problems. We didn't. Now, we would never have wanted any other way. Talking's actually a hobby for me. It's not really what I do. Talking is just something that I also do, but what I really do is I vibe. I'd be telepathic. MALE SPEAKER (ON TV): You know, we're watching something now that's really a historical phenomenon, something like Christianity in ancient Rome-- that's something starting very, very small and building a whole cultural context around it, which I think, ultimately, will become the predominant culture, maybe in 50 or 100 years, maybe sooner. [SQUEAKING] INSLEY: We are capable of sensing everlasting pleasure. That's what tantric yoga is about. We are gods, and everything we do is wonderful. You're afraid of the table. The table's afraid of you. BECKY: They never planned for the future. They weren't supposed to get old. And we were never supposed to grow up. The lost, the unwanted, and the abused came here with the purest of intentions-- to build a place where there would be no rules other than a peaceful existence. There are no couples for them. For them, there was only the moment. They tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world. And for a moment maybe it worked. But I think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us. We always saw it in them. They attempted to unlearn jealousy, want, and hate, to not possess anything, including each other. They tried to free themselves from materialism, but soon they were drowning in it. Finally, we all saw failure in each other, and everyone was looking for a way out. [BREATHING] [DISTANT SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] BECKY: This is where our story begins. [LAUGHING] MALE SPEAKER: Hey, come on. Oh, come on, now. FEMALE SPEAKER: Ohh! MALE SPEAKER: This is for the community fund. And this little one is for replacing Jenny's roof. Um, it's leaking again, and she has asthma. Hi, mom. Are you gonna sleep forever? I thought you were gonna sleep forever. VICTOR'S DAD: My boy, my boy. My son. My own flesh and blood. Wither comest thee? Are you going wake up? Or are you gonna sleep forever? What do you mean forever? I don't know. It's just-- I was just worried about you. VICTOR'S DAD: My boy, my boy. Wither comest thee? Stop it, dad ;LAUGHING] Hey, Vic. Take your shot. Come on. Aw. Hey. [MUSIC - FEAR, "I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU] VICTOR: What's going on? Nothing. So I guess Becky failed all her classes in school. Why? She couldn't focus after her dad got sick. But she's back taking care of him. Wait, she's here? Yeah. I think she's hooking up with Chad. No, she's not. Yeah, she is. No, she's not. Yeah, she is. She's acting really weird. I'm worried about her. [HEARTBEATS] Hey, Fishman. Fishman. Come on. Good man. Frogboy. It's such good weed. Did you guys see Becky? She's walking down to Chad's house. She's only back 'cause her dad has cancer. CHAD: Naproxen? No. I don't know what that-- I have never heard of Naproxen before. What the hell is that shit? No, no. I never of it before. -What's up, man? -Hey. Hey, Victor. It's good to see you. Haven't seen you since I've been back. Uh, I know. I've just-- I've been just staying in my-- in my room a lot. Cool. CHAD: You know what we need to do? We need to get some oxys. Right? I can-- I can get-- I can get Naproxen. Have you ever heard of Naproxen before? -No. -Nope. CHAD: Well, we really-- we really need to get some oxys. I'm gonna go look it up. I'm gonna look it up. Is there anything I can do to help? With what? CHAD: --this little pill identifier thing. What'd I say it was called? -Naproxen. CHAD: Yeah, well, that says it's a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory. Yeah, Timmy. I just looked it up. It says it's a non-narcotic. No, I-- I need something. I need something real. OK, what would I want with ecstasy? What? So I-- So I can hug people? I hug people already, Timmy. Why would I-- why would I want it ? So I-- so I can get all-- get all touchy-feely? Well, no, no. I-- I'm touchy-feely already. See-- see, people get ecstasy so they can get like me, OK? That's-- yeah, OK. Yeah. Well, just see what you can do, all right? Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. [COUGHING] You OK, buddy? VICTOR: Yeah. Yeah, well we're gonna need to get some more Vics from your dad. Gave me a lecture this morning about not taking his drugs anymore. He's afraid we'll be, like, addicts. No, baby. These-- I'm selling it. Coming? -Yeah. INSLEY: There are so many ways to get high. For example, you could crawl onto the roof of your garage. [SCATTERED LAUGHTER] Or climb a big tree. What else was I going to say? When I was little, Insley drew a square on my butt with magic marker. He said that section was his. Then he came up to me the other day an he said he was ready to collect his piece of ass. Holy shit. That's like a fucking time capsule. BECKY: God, he is so creepy. Course, I'd be the last one to condone drugs for getting high. [LAUGHING] Did you leave his weed? [MUSIC - THE AVENGERS, "WE ARE THE ONE"] Those little fuckers get right on top of me. I didn't think you guys were coming home tonight. Yeah, I can see that. I'm confiscating this. No, you're not. Gotta go help make dinner for my dad. CHAD: Look at you. You're wasted! CHAD'S MOM: You know you are not supposed to smoke in this house. BECKY: I'm out of here. CHAD: Yeah, right, mom. Mom, mom. Look at you. You're fucking wasted. I'm 18 years old. I can do whatever the fuck f want. I can't take this anymore. CHAD'S DAD: Chad-- [PHONE RINGING] CHAD'S DAD: --when you smoke-- Go on. Go after her. CHAD'S DAD: --it's like you're saying you don't care-- Shut up. [PHONE RINGING] CHAD'S DAD: --what we think. When you do it right in our face, it's like saying fuck you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Yeah, hi. Um, yeah. Here she is. It's your mom. Hello? Mom, I'm doing something right now. I'm not hungry. I have not been eating junk food all day. Fine. I'll see you soon. Bye. My mom keep nagging me about getting home for dinner. OK. Let's go. Bye. RACHEL: Night. VICTOR: See you. Mom? [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Did you guys have fun after I left? You can do anything you want to me. I'm going to move away. I'm gonna get my own place somewhere. You know, maybe in a big city. Maybe, you think-- you should come with me. Maybe when my dad gets better. But he really needs me. HYPNOTIST (ON RADIO): Imagine you are drifting down, down, down like a feather. More and more and gently down, like a feather over a beautiful ravine. Now, let's put daddy in the room. VICTOR: Mom? Mom, um, I'm going to move away, and I need some money. You gave all your money to Insley and all of them, why won't you give any to me? Look, you-- you don't understand. It's too-- it's j just too early in the morning to be talking about this, anyway. But it's always too early or too late. When am I going to get my money, and exactly how much is it going to be? You don't have to worry about that. You're going to be a very wealthy young man. I won't let you go. You don't get any money until you're 21. What? I'm your prisoner? That doesn't even sound legal. Don't talk to me about the law. Look, I know you and your friends are doing drugs. What does a druggie need money for, anyway? You know, you're funding a whole bunch of drug addicts right now. Half the people in this place are drug addicts. And I hear that Insley gives Rachel's mom $20,000 year just so she'll fuck him once a week. That is not true. Yes, it is. It's so true. Insley's a hypnotist. He's controlling your brain. Everything he does is just a manipulation to get your money. Even my existence-- do you think it's a coincidence that a psychic is my dad? That's not true. It's-- it's not true. you're just a kid. You don't know anything. You don't know anything. Shouldn't even be allowed to have your own money. You're wrong. No, I'm not. You're not just-- you know, I have a really hard time being around you. Just leave. Go. That's what I'm trying to do. Insley's running me tonight. -Really? -Yeah. He's running me on Wednesday. Uh, is Tao here? Yeah. he's in the basement. [MUSIC - BAD BRAINS, "AT THE MOVIES"] Stop messing with the light. Hey, do you have Jake's number? Why? I just want to talk to him about something. You wanna be the one selling for Jake when he gets back. Huh, Vic? I thought you were supposed to be rich. Why don't you just get the money from your mom? Because my mom gives all my money to everybody but me, OK? Just give me the damn number. Now, put father in the room. Give him a red hat. And then make it purple. Have him round, like a beach ball. Have him as small as a pea. Have him as big as the universe. Have him as tiny as a dot. Every hour-- -Hey. --of every day you grow more and more attracted to me. Dad, I really need to talk to you. I need to take a short break, but I'll be right back. And while I'm gone, mull these thoughts and game over and over in your brain. What does thou seest there? A tangled foot and religious snare? Dad, I'm gonna move away and I'm gonna get my own place. Move from our great house? And get your own place? I don't even have a place of my own now. Where are you staying? I have a couple of boxes of things here and there, like-- you know, I have a couple of drawers full of clothes and, I mean, that's about it. That all I need. I sleep with a different woman every night, and so what do I need a bed of my own for? And when you grow up, you will sleep with a different woman every night. Doesn't that's sound nice? I am grown up, dad. Well, then you don't need a place, either. And I'll swap for you here. And then-- uh, and then you'll sell in Tao. Well, as soon as you can get here. Well, the party's coming up, so it'll be-- I'll be like the perfect time. All right. Cool. I'll see you then. OK. Thanks, Jake. Is he into it? Yeah. He's, uh, bringing me pounds of good weed, so. And after I sell it, then we can get out of here. -Hey, let's get out of here. -No, no. Just wait. INSLEY: Now put your daddy in the room. Make him as small as a grain of sand. Make him as big as the universe. Make him an hourglass. Make him timeless. Every hour of every day, you feel more confident. Whoa. What's he doing to her? He's fucking running her. INSLEY: Your body runs like a river. Your nerves become the eyes of strength. You feel warm. You feel safe. And as you touch, you become happiness. [GLASS BREAKING] BECKY'S DAD: I'm taking so many different vitamins and experimental cancer cures I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have room in my stomach for food. But I can't stop taking one because it might be the one that's helping me. I'm sorry you came back to this place because of me. I'll go back to school as soon as you're better. Taking all this medication makes me feel so dark. Promise me, even if I don't get better, that-- that you'll leave this place. I promise. CHAD: Look, I am so fucked up. Vicky, I swear I just saw you holding a stand-up vacuum cleaner right now. Fuck. I love [INAUDIBLE]. I think he's out. Yeah, I'm sure he is. Thanks. Becky, are you all right? You just made out with Chad, now you want to make out with me? I can't handle sharing you. Come on, Victor. I thought you guys were cool with that. I mean, that's what our parents are like. Our parents are fucking insane. Hey. Hey, boys. Look at this. -Jake, when did you get back? -Right now. It's good to see you. BECKY: You, too. Sit down. have some whiskey. [CAN OPENING] So how's it been, living off the place? Yeah, I love it. Really? Why? I don't know. I mean, I have all these really cool new friends and, I don't know. It's just awesome. [KISSING] JAKE: You wanna do this? BECKY: Yeah. JAKE: Yeah? BECKY: Yeah. Yeah. [MUSIC - U.K. SUBS, "WARHEAD"] TAO: Oh, my god. What's up buddy? -I've got it. It's the bomb. It's the best. TAO: Oh, my god! Oh, dude. What's going on, man? Dude, did anyone see you yet? -No. I've been laying low. Yeah, man. The only person I saw was Becky, and she was really drunk and coming onto me really, really hard. Harder. JAKE: So I started fucking her, right-- Wait, wait. Wait. You fucked Becky? -Yeah. Come here, man. Listen to this, man. The best part. So I'm fucking her, right? And she keeps telling me to go harder and harder and harder, so I keep going fucking harder, right? BECKY: Harder, Jake. JAKE: And all the sudden we hear this really loud fucking-- [SCREAMING] JAKE: --pop. No! JAKE: Yeah. She's just wobbling around like-- Are you hearing what he's saying? CHAD: Come on, dog. I told you she's everybody's girlfriend. JAKE: I guess I fucking threw out her fucking hip. You know, Becky's mom said she had to go to the chiropractor. That must be why. JAKE: Are you kidding me? TAO: No, I'm not fucking kidding you. That's why! JAKE: Holy shit. That's so fucked up. TAO: Oh, dude. SAM: That's crazy shit, man. JAKE: Yo, grab me a beer. TAO: Fuck. Here you go. -Yeah. See, Chad, that's why we're different, man. Every one of your friends comes up to me and tells me that you fucking ripped them off. You see, me and Vic, we're gonna sell fucking better weed than you at cost. You're a total dick, man, ripping off all your friends. Dude, I'm-- I'm just-- I'm trying to relax. Fuck. I can't even just sit here and hang out with you around. You know what, man? I'm going to put your ass out of businessman, as a matter of fact. Dude, dude, how long until-- until-- until you leave. You're not even-- you're not even allowed on the place. JAKE: That's true. You know what? I can't wait until I just-- I wake up one day and you're just-- you're just fucking gone. Yeah. Well, you better get used to me being here, man, because I'm gonna be here all summer. CHAD: Well, maybe my operation isn't that easy to fucking shut down, OK? Yes, man, actually it is. CHAD: All right, no, it isn't. Yeah, it is. Look, why-- why you gotta do this in front of everyone? Huh? Yeah, man. I'm sorry. It's just because you're such a fucking dick, making so much fucking money off your friends. Fuck you, all right? Fucking dick. [MUSIC - PRINCE FAR I AND THE ARABS, "PLANT UP"] Tao, you gotta try this. Fuck. Fuck. Do you hear that? Shh. Do you hear that? I don't hear it. Shit. I think I heard something. VICTOR: No, you didn't. I guess I'll go check. You know, um-- you know, um, Becky sleeps over at Victor's all the time. -What? -Yeah. No, she doesn't, man. Yeah, she does, dude. No one was there, dude Fishman. VICTOR: Frogboy. PETE: Vic. Your mother told me you wanted to move away. Yeah. I'm going to. You know, I was here when you were born. In fact, I was at your birth. In fact, I was the one who grabbed your head when it was coming out of your mother's vagina. And my advice to you-- stay put. Stay put. Stay put, because no matter where you go, you will never be as understood, accepted, and loved as you are here. I know, man. I saw you come out of your mother's vagina. Look, I'm really sorry, Vic. I hate to go back on my word, man. But Tao's my new favorite person. See, I only like to hang out with people I can learn from. I only like to learn very specific things. Tao's gonna be selling for me now. What the fuck are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about, man. No, I don't. Well, maybe you should think about it. Fuck you, man. Fuck you, man. Fuck you! Go fuck yourself. RACHEL: Hey. What's going on down there? -Nothing. [MOANING] [HEAVIER AND FASTER MOANING] [MUSIC BLARING] You have a little temple in here. Oh, my god. Did you hear about how Jake threw Becky's hip out? It's probably because that double-crossing bastard is so used to fucking prostitutes and shit-- Oh, my god. Jake fucked a prostitute? VICTOR: A prostitute? He's fucked lots of them. He's a sick one. When I went to visit him up north, whenever he would get like an extra hundred bucks, he would just go straight to the brothel. Are you serious? Oh, my god. Jake is such a pig. I knew it. [GUN CHAMBER SPINNING] CHAD: You know what? Fucking nobody cares about Jake and Tao, all right? Fuck them. They can sell all the weed that they want. I'd rather be selling pills, anyway. Kapow! Fuck. These are really fucking good, and they're like generic Percocet. But Percs have the hydrocodone and these little-- these little fuckers have, uh, the poxyprophene or something like that. I don't feel it, dude. Give me another one. -No! No, no, no. You give me some money first, and then I'll give you another pill. Well, I don't feel anything, either. OK. Well, that's bullshit because these are good. OK, these are god. I'll give you each-- I'll give you each one more, but you gotta give me-- but you gotta give me some money. I'm not gonna pay for a pill that doesn't do anything. -All right. -Did you see Jake's new bike? It's so nice. And it's the nicest mountain bike in the world. And when Jake's not riding his bike-- [MOANING] - --he had sex. Do you feel bad knowing that Jake is the one fucking Becky now when she used to be your girlfriend? -OK. You know what? No girl has ever been my friend, all right? Love goes in and out. I heard that when Becky was four, she put slugs in her pussy. And once, when someone asked her whether she liked salamanders or frogs better, she said frogs because they were crunchier. Oh, and once, she bit the head off a toad. VICTOR: Kids do weird shit, man. You know what? Honestly, I could care less who fucks what. I think I'm just gonna fucking hold up a pharmacy. Right. Ever you aren't dumb enough to do that. I would do anything for some oxys. And what happens when the cashier pulls out a gun and points it at your face? What then? I don't know. I think maybe in that moment you become a man. VICTOR: Don't point that-- CHAD: You become a man, right? Are you a man? Don't point that-- get away from me. Oh, come on, Vic. Come on. Come on, bitch. It's not fucking loaded. VICTOR: Why Jake? Like, out of everybody? Why BECKY: I just don't want to be controlled by anyone. VICTOR: You gonna run away with me or not? Where to, Vic? Away from here. It's really fucking crazy out there, Vic. VICTOR: It's crazy in here. We could just run away, live like hobos till I inherit my fortune. Then we'll live like kings. I'll take care of you for the rest of our lives. Want me to read you some poetry? Sure. "By a route obscure and lonely, haunted by ill angels, only, where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, on a black thrown reigns upright. I have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim Thule-- from a wild clime that lieth, sublime, out of SPACE-- out of TIME. By the lakes that thus outspread their lone waters, lone and dead,-- their sad waters, sad and chilly, with the snows of the longing lily,-- there the traveler meets, aghast, sheeted Memories of the Past-- shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by-- white-robed forms of friends long given, in agony, to Earth-- and Heaven. [CRACKING] [WATER POURING] BECKY (DREAMY): Victor? [GASPS] Becky. Becky. You have to go away with me. All right, Vic. Let's do it. BECKY'S DAD: I know. No. Actually, it's already in my lungs. And actually, I think there's a tiny bit of it in my brain. You know, what I was wondering is if I would still be eligible for those treatments. I see. Yes, I'm-- I'm very sorry, too. Thank you. -Where's my drink? -Um. [MUSIC - SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES, "HAPPY HOUSE"] RACHEL: Victor said Jake fucked a lot of whores. What do you mean whores? I mean he fucked a lot of prostitutes. They're all sickos. Yeah, especially Jake. You look good as a man. Maybe you I should just fuck. CHAD: Thank you. Chad, you know what your problem really is? You don't live life. I live life. You live "Alice in Wonderland." CHAD: OK, mother fucker, OK. That's right. I am a mother fucker. I fucked all your mothers. That's why Becky and Rachel look so much like me. RACHEL: Victor said that's why Jake threw your hip out is because he's used to fucking horrible fucking prostitutes. How do you know that he threw my hip out? Because he's a fucking asshole and he told everyone, just like he told everyone that you threw up on his dick. I didn't really throw up on his dick. I just kind of gagged myself with it. It was the first time and I threw up like a cup of clear liquid right into his lap. Aren't you pissed off that he threw your hip out? Everybody's pissed. Well, aren't you at least gonna yell at the sicko? Yes. I think I will. But later. You fucking sicko. Why did you fucking tell everybody about that? JAKE: Whoa, take it easy, baby, OK? BECKY: Don't touch me. Hey, hey, shh. Look. Everybody just took this really good ecstasy, OK? I happen to have two of them right here. Do you want to do it with me? -Yeah. Sounds fucking great. All right. Calm down, OK? Look. Should we snort it or swallow? I think I'm gonna snort mine if that's OK with you. [MUSIC PLAYING] So you fuck prostitutes and you snort drugs off the toilet seat? That's really fucking classy. Whoa. Becky, come on, baby. I just did a fucking rainbow real of ecstasy around the toilet seat. Come on. Then why didn't you fucking do it off the back of the toilet or the counter or something? You don't even know that's disgusting because you fuck prostitutes. -Look. Becky, baby, could we just talk about this in a half an hour, please? -Oh, in half an hour? -Yeah. -In half a fucking hour? That's just great. That's-- that's just fucking beautiful. That's fucking beautiful. (DREAMY) That's beautiful, Jake. That's fucking beautiful. It's fucking beautiful. It's fucking beautiful. Beautiful. -Jesus. (DREAMY) Please tell me what the hell you're saying right now. BECKY (DREAMY): That's really fucking beautiful. JAKE (DREAMY): Please. Tell me. It's fucking beautiful. JAKE: Becky, what the fuck are you saying? You OK? You know what, Jake? JAKE: What? Do you know that I'm at my sexual peak right now? JAKE: Yeah? You sure? BECKY: Mhm. JAKE: You positive? You gonna show me? BECKY: Uh-huh. CHAD: Look at this place. Just light one. CHAD: No, this is nice. [MUSIC PLAYING] BECKY: Sorry if I was freaking you out earlier when I was touching you. When I was little I liked to be touched. Let's go cow tipping. Let's go cow tipping. TAO: I mean, can we? CHAD: Yeah, of course. I mean, if we go-- the cows will still be asleep, so if we go right now we can get them before dawn. BECKY: I've never been cow tipping. I wanna go. Doesn't that hurt them? CHAD: No. It usually breaks some of their ribs. OK, no. The cows have a lot of ribs, OK? So if you push them down it doesn't matter. You can push me down and I wouldn't even care. But I mean, if we're going to do this, we need to do this now, so come on. Let's go. TAO: Yeah, yeah. CHAD: Come on. It'll be cool. Come on. [COWS LOWING] TAO: Shh. Birds are waking up. You'll wake up the cows. Shh. Stop. You're gonna wake up the cows. BECKY: I think they're already awake. [COW LOWING] JAKE: I guess we're not gonna tip them over, though. TAO: You guys heard what Harris did, right? JAKE: No. TAO: He fucked a cow. BECKY: Oh, my god. No, didn't. TAO: Yeah, he did. He fucking fucked a cow. Took her down to a pond so, you know, she'd be at the right level, and then he just gave it to her. -Ew. -What? TAO: I was there. [INAUDIBLE] and insert his penis into it. It's not one of my prouder moments, but yes, I did. JAKE: You're nasty. TAO: I'm not nasty. I just-- I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. JAKE: Did you like it? TAO: Like it? Oh, yes. I-- I really get off on watching cows do it to each other. Chad. Chad! What's happening? Chad. Chad. Chad, are you really gonna do this? CHAD: Everybody knows that the whole world's gonna burn one day, right? But for this old lady, that day is tonight. [COW SCREAMS] RACHEL: I can't believe that you killed the cow. You were just supposed to push it over. You weren't supposed to burn it! That is fucked up, man. It was fucked up. CHAD: It was fucked up? I'm the fucked up one? I'm fucked up? Did you do anything to stop me? You're all so fucking great, aren't you? What about the cow? Did you do anything to stop me? No, you just fucking watched. You watched me. You're full of shit. What are you going to do, huh? You're gonna fucking hit me? Do something. What are you gonna do? You're fucking full of shit. CHAD: What are you going to do, huh? What are you going to do, Jake? What are you gonna do? You both fucking watched the fucking cow, didn't you? Come on. Hit me. Come on. Hit me. Come on, you're gonna-- -Fucking bitch. -Wow. You fucking hit me. Come on. I couldn't even feel that one. Fucking hit me again. JAKE: That's what I'm gonna do. CHAD: Why don't you do it again, huh? Come on. Hit me. Come on. Do it-- JAKE: Go the fuck home, man. You fucking go home. No, you go home. -No, you fucking go home. -Mother fucker. CHAD: No, go home. Go home. Come on. JAKE: Chad, get the fuck out of here, and go the fuck home. Go home? CHAD: Fine. Go home. Fucking all of you fucking go home. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wanna sleep with you tonight. It's already the next day. I just wanna lay down for a little while. I really don't feel good. I don't feel good, either. I think I need to be left alone. Don't touch me. Don't. Can't handle you anymore. Can't take the pressure of you all anymore. Weren't you gonna take me away somewhere? No. When I'm a rich man I'm gonna buy this place and I'm gonna burn it to the ground. I'm going to pour salt on the ashes so nothing can grow here for hundreds of years. Don't touch me. What happened this time? You burned a cow, fucker. That's what happened this time. -You know what? You can shut up. Why don't you just go fuck somebody else and leave me alone, huh? That was so fucked up. You know what? Innocent murderers go free every day of the fucking week. Everybody-- everybody eats tortured, cooked cows every day. So what? I fucking-- I burned a cow. So what? That was so fucking evil, you sicko. It made me so hot when you did it. I knew it. INSLEY: Repression, especially sexual repression, is the route of violence and child abuse. I believe that. Married men who sleep with prostitutes bring home diseases to their wives simply because they can't be polygamous. They die of diseases that less repressed people would never get. If you are truly happy, you'll only leave your body when you want. Sugarplum. All right. All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not here. I do not sleep. I'm a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glint on snow. I am the sun on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awake in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I'm not here. I didn't die. RACHEL: Victor! I don't know what to do. Jake gave Becky a bag of shrooms. Now she tripping really hard. She keeps giving me these blank stares and wandering off. Now I can't find her anywhere. Where did you see her last? She was over near my house, but she's not there anymore. All right. Let's split up and find her. OK. VICTOR: There she is. Becky? Hey. Hey. Hi. Becky, I'm sorry. Just give us the-- give us the mushrooms, baby. Fucking go get her, man. Fucking don't fucking let her go. VICTOR: Becky! Becky! [MUSIC PLAYING] CHAD: Becky! VICTOR: Becky!
