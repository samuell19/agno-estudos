Shes going to win the race today. - YouII collapse in the fresh air. - Tell me how much it costs. My little conk. I dont think so, fatty. Get lost. Not even the Bank of England could afford what youre asking of me, you bastard. What is he thinking? Who knows what kind of a person he is? So much is happening. Half the night wasted with that beer barrel, and I havent earned a single guinea. What dreadful deed did he propose? Theres nothing you havent done before. Do you have to get your three haporth in? Mind your own business. - Youre just as bad as him. - If you want, III give you a lift. You have to walk through Kensington and Chelsea, where he looks for his victims, then...you’re dead. If I meet him, I’ll get two guineas out of him and have it off with him. Suit yourself. I wont let anyone infringe upon my liberty. Ill walk home if I want to. What are you doing here? What do you want? My child, I’m not doing anything. I’m simply waiting for my death. I’ll be standing here, asking for pennies, till the Lord calls me to Him. I beg, and charitable people give me small handouts. It is a pleasant way of making the wait for my death pass more quickly. - And every now and then you have a drink. - Yes, lass, I do. Everyone lives their life in their own way, until the Lord shows them mercy. Thank you. Thank you, my little girl. May heaven grant you a long and happy life. Thank you. - Its all right, my friend. - Farewell. My child, where are you? My child! What has he done to you? My child! Doctor. - Good evening, Frieda. - You’ve brought me another doll. - Yes. - Doctor. A beautiful doll. Im coming. - Is this my doll? - Keep going, Frieda. - Doctor. - Stop that. - Do you want me to throw it in the water? - Yes, of course. When are you coming back? Soon? I dont know yet, Frieda. I never know. I cant know. Hey, Frieda. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yes. And now youre looking for somewhere to have breakfast? Im having breakfast by the sewers. lye brought something to eat - a sack full of rotten old plants. I’d keep away from anything old. I prefer green young things myself. Oh, it’s you. Good morning, Doctor. Did you work all through the night again? You will finish yourself off if you go on like this. You’re not helping your patients this way. In what way do they benefit, if you’re ill? You should have a strong cup of coffee first. Is anyone waiting yet? Yes, theyve messed up my corridor with their dirty shoes. You should work less and only treat wealthy patients from now on. More sophisticated people. Do you really think... - Would you like some pie? - No, thank you. You havent eaten anything yet. Dont you like home-baked pie? - Not for breakfast. - Its an old family recipe. Its delicious. - You should do something for your health. - Yes. - Mrs Baxter... - Yes? Would you mind if I paid my rent a little later this month? Well, for me that isnt a problem, but it is for you. You really are an admirable person, but unfortunately, you are also rather naive. Thanks very much for the coffee... and for the compliment. Youre welcome. Did I make you wait again? - Thats all right. Morning, Doctor. - Never mind. - Just one moment, please. - Take your time, Doctor. You work day and night, so we should be able to wait a while. Hello, little girl. Still afraid of the doctor with the knife? No. - Who was here first? - I was, Doctor. - Please sit down over there. - All right. My leg is causing me a great deal of trouble, Doctor. Im in a lot of pain. But Im sure youII manage to fix it. - Lets see. - Yes. Its looking better than before. To hell with that rotten abscess. They wont want it there. Pull yourself together. Its burning like fire. - Now its better. - All right. That was it. - Its better already. - See? - In three days, III take another look at it. - III come back then. But at the moment... I dont have more than five shillings. Pay the rest when youve got it. I really wonder what a benefactor like you lives on. You must be stinking rich. - Possibly, but that’s my concern, not yours. - No offence. Please move on. There is absolutely nothing to see here. Move along. Please move along. - Scotland Yard in a large-scale operation. - Exactly. Im afraid theres nothing to see here, young man. - Ah, Inspector. Everythings ready for you. - The two witnesses? Sergeant McCollough entrusted them to me. I sent them to the pub. - Was that a good idea? - I told the landlord not to serve alcohol. Well, I shall see. Come with us, Miller. Inspector. I think shes called Mrs Higgins. Come on, stand up. Listen, I’m a lady, and I’ll only stand up for the Queen. Youre quite right. It seems this young man has only served in the colonies. And you? - I see. Take the witness to me. - Yes, sir. Come on. Just come with me. Here we are. Please sit down. My name is Selby. I work as an inspector for Scotland Yard. My name is Pritchard. Mr Pritchard talked to the victim Sally Brown shortly before she disappeared. Before her death. Shortly before her death, I spoke to her. How do you know shes dead? Blindness has sharpened my ears and I can distinguish a cry of fear from a cry of death. Im like a dog in that respect. He approached the spot from whence the cry came. He heard a struggle. The cry was uttered, and then sounds of dragging and gasping were heard, as if the victim was being towed away. I know what youre thinking. The testimony is too precise for a blind man. You dont know how to use your senses of hearing and smell. My senses are sharper. If I ever met you again, I would without doubt recognise you immediately. I sensed and took in your aura immediately. Would you be able to pick out the murderer from ten people? Without a doubt. This man has a personality, even if he is tormented by his physical urges. And last night, he was probably tormented by greater fears than poor Sally and myself. Yes, he was incredibly nervous. So he’s a madman? Perhaps, but he suffers from the particular kind of madness that borders on genius. Do you understand? Despite everything, the man does not have a bad aura. Hes more like a victim than an executioner. Nothing concrete, then. If you want concrete information, I shall do my best to provide it. He has to be short and strong, and he certainly is not a manual but rather an intellectual worker. - Why is that? - Because he has a certain smell. A strange, peculiar smell that combines intellect and strength at the same time. - Do you know a lot about spices? - No, I wouldn’t say that. - Then I’ll try and give you an example. - All right. Fire away. - Indians have special spices for sauces. - You must have served in India. Yes, and I learnt a lot there. It was the most important lesson of my life. Were you there a long time? Yes, I was. I gained a lot in India, and I also lost something - my eyesight. Thats when I learnt to identify the scents of oriental spices for saucesmint, kokum, curry... With this man, I also felt that I was able to identify his various scents - sweat, expensive soap, top quality fabric. And another very special odour, one that even you would be able to detect. - Alcohol. - Indeed I would. On you, for example. That would be too easy. It contained 90% alcohol, and it triggered a surprising reaction. I felt as if I had been transported back to India. It was the smell of a rare tropical plant which you only find in the greenhouses of botanical gardens here - Aechmea. - Inspector... - Yes? I... Im sorry, but you cant treat people like this. Im in a hurry. Annette is alone in the shop, and the young thing is inexperienced. I must go back before she does something stupid. - Miss Higgins, please sit down. - I have waited long enough. - If you want to ask me something, do it now. - You saw the murderer? I saw an abductor. A girl in the arms of a short, dubious guy, a midget. I mean, I only really saw blurred silhouettes because it was dark. - The night was pitch-black and foggy. - But you didnt hear a scream first? I heard three screams - a quiet one, a loud one, and a very loud one. And then the shouts. That must have been the blind man. He kept shouting, “My child.” - Did you assume that the girl was dead? - Well, shed stopped moving. And even when he suddenly lifted her up, she didnt make a sound. - Describe that moment in detail, please. - But lye already done that. All right. Would you recognise the murderer or abductor, if you saw him? - Yes and no. - What do you mean? Theres a chance of 50% that I would. Id be able to say if it wasnt him, but Im not sure if id be able to say if it was. You cant be too careful on this point. And now I must get back to my shop. Oh, by the way, it’s a needlework and wool shop at 31 Old Compton Street. If you send your wife to my shop, I’ll give her a special price. III have to get married sooner than I had planned. - Youre at the right age, young man. - May I ask if youre married? No, I’m a few weeks past the right age. - Can I go now? - Sure. Thank you. See you later. Pas de bourree, to the front and to the side, and the fifth position. And pas de bourree, and front and side, and the fifth position. Pas de bourree and reverence. Well done, Cynthia. Dont forget the arms. The arms are everything. Stop, Ludmilla. You snap at the barre like a dog snaps at a bone. Youre supposed to float like a snowflake. Fourth position. Stretch your foot. Mind your port de bras. What about the knee, Cynthia? You know what pains me the most - bent knees and wooden arms. Oh, khorosho. Your boyfriend, Anthony. Get away from the barre. Fifth position, please. - I didnt think you would come. - Didnt you? Why not? Were not enemies. - So were friends, then? - Yes. As you wish. Its up to you. - Well... Whats the reason why youre here? - rn not sure. Everything and nothing. - id like to... Can I talk to you? - Not now, in the middle of a class. - What will the others say? - Its always the same. All you care about is ballet. I come last, and I have to put up with so much. You dont think about anything other than your tour, anyway. And Im sitting here, supposed to find the killer. - Dont start all that again. - You find it ridiculous, I know. Look, we agreed to split up, so it would be better if we didnt see each other for the time being. Yes, I know. But it’s hard. - Because nothing’s right at the moment. - Yes, of course. Youre like a child. You saw me as a kind of mother figure. I never felt like your lover. That wasnt good for me. But if you have problems at work, you’re welcome to discuss them with me. You’re looking for Jack the Ripper? Continue your declaration of love later. I need Cynthia. - When will you be done? - I think it will be a late night tonight. - III pick you up. - All right. Come here. What was I, then? I was a good mother to you, wasnt I? What the punters paid supported both of us. You and me, my son, my little idiot. Darling. You peeped through the keyhole. If you hadnt done that, I would still be alive. But the man had already made up his mind. Come on. Take your chance. Youre a darling. I focused all my attention on you. Your father will have to pay too, as soon as you have paid, or he will hit me. The fact that you have seen me now makes everything much easier. It means that you can do it too. Come on, my pretty boy, Im inviting you. Well do it. III do a particularly good job on you. No. - Who is that? Oh, did I scare you? - It’s me, Mrs Baxter. You’re not going out at this hour, are you? - Its very urgent. - No case can be that urgent. - The patient can wait ten minutes. - I have to go. III do what I can to stop you. I cant stand by and watch you go out every night. I will... Give me that. You have no right to interfere in my affairs. But, dear Doctor, whats wrong with you? Youre completely different. Let me suggest something to you. Well have a cup of tea and you can relax a little. Please sit down. Doctor, you should sit down. Just a moment. Some lemon? - Doctor, I asked you something. - Yes? - Would you like some lemon? - I’ll leave it up to you. All right, my dear. There you are. III have a sip as well. Here we are. Now tell me, Doctor, do you like it here in my house? Its all right, you can admit it. I know its not very luxurious. - That doesn’t really bother me. - I’m glad. So, you’re happy here? If you, well... If you could afford to rent a better place... - would you stay here with me? - Yes, of course. Why? I was thinking of our conversation yesterday. I seem to have been a little too insistent that you take it easy. I think that I have feelings of true friendship for you, my dear. - Yes. - You are such an extraordinary person. But even you need friendship, affection and warmth, not to mention love. Do you really want to live without all that? A man who is as interesting, attractive and generous as you - I know you dont want to admit it - should, despite his readiness to make sacrifices, think of his own life sometimes, and not just the lives of others. Yes. Of course. Just a little sip. Damn you, you stupid old bitch! Please forgive me. I’m a little irritable. Its because Im overtired. You meant well. I was wrong. Why are you afraid of women, my friend? Hello, mister. Yes, I meant you. Don’t run away. I wont hurt you. I just want to accompany you. You cant deny a lady that. - Sorry, I dont have time. - Oh, youre worried that youII have to pay. - All right, if you insist. - Thats what I like to hear, sweetheart. - Im sure we can agree on a price. - Ill pay whatever you wish. What a gentleman! Come in. Why dont you sit down? Dont be afraid, sweetheart. Dont squeeze me so hard. No! Dont! Lulu? Please open the door. Lulu! - Whats the panic? - Let me in. I cant tell you in the corridor. There was somebody there. Jean! Has she gone? Jean! Oh, Jeanny. - What a rotten day. They’re not biting. - Charlie! You want to fry a famished trout like that? Id like to see you catch such a beauty. The most youll ever catch is a fly. Not bad for an amateur like you. The bastards cleared off. You were too smelly for him. Another one! Pull it in. Perhaps itlI give you its paw this time. Blimey! - Hello. - Hello, Inspector. - Well, aren’t you cheerful? Any news? - Not that I know of. All right. - Theres a madman waiting for you. - What does he want? He wont talk to people like me. Im obviously not trustworthy enough for the state secrets he intends to reveal. Well see. - So, youre in charge? - Only of the murder squad. Just a moment. Youre the one whos after the Ripper and who isnt catching him? - Thats right. III try again later. - My names Charlie. - And your last name? - My fathers name? Im afraid I dont know. - Perhaps its Meyer. - Mind your own business. - Your profession? - I fish. Then I sell whatever I dont eat myself or give away. - So lets say youre jobless. - Dont interrupt. - What allegations are you making? - Allegations? Im not making any. lye found something for you. There you are. - Where did you find that? - I fished it out of the canal. Why are you bringing it to me? I thought you might like to know where the murdered girls end up. The Rippers victims. Here, this proves it. He cuts them up into pieces and throws them in the water. Look. This was in the water for less than a week. I know what rn talking about. And the fact that shes still wearing the ring will make your work easier. Take a close look at it. If I were you, id have the whole canal searched, but further up from where I found this. In the current, of course. - You understand, dont you? - Yes, thank you, Charles. - Youre welcome. My pleasure. - Where can we find you, if we need you? Well, I’m of no fixed abode, but if you need me, you’ll find me at the Dolphin. I like to have a little drink now and then, you see? See? I was right. Waiting for your boss was just the right thing to do. Your most obedient servant, Your Excellency. Now, tell me, dont I deserve some kind of compensation for my assistance, some kind of reward? Your Excellency, surely Scotland Yard may assume that you did this out of altruism. I dont know that word, but since it was you who said it, it cant mean anything good. Hello, Mr Channy. Yes, please send me a chemist. I need something analysed thats been given to me. Thank you. Arrange for Sally Browns mother to come here. She has to identify the ring. I will talk to Major Bentley. Well have to have the canal searched, of course. At last something tangible has fallen into our hands. I find that expression a little distasteful. Forgive me for venturing this remark. - Unbelievable. - Quiet, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the head of Scotland Yards murder squad asked you to come because were starting a new experiment which should help us track down the killer known as Jack the Ripper. - What a nice boy. - Just my type. The artist Mr Altmeyer, whom some of you may know, will try to draw a portrait of the murderer, based on your descriptions, which might help us with our investigation. We think that he frequents your establishment, Miss Lulu, and that he has close contact with the ladies you employ. Yes, poor Jeanny was the last one. Oh, she was an angel. An angel! Since when have angels looked like that? One of your guests aroused your suspicion. Please describe him. Yes, my attention was drawn to one of them. Id seen him with Sally Brown a few times. He dresses unobtrusively and acts like a gentleman. He has a very striking profile and is of average height. He seems to prefer dark colours. He wears a black coat... with a cape, if I remember rightly. - Is his hair blond or brown? - Greyish-blond. Like salt and pepper. - Its quite long and straggly. - And the shape of his face? Its more of a thin and angular face. A strong, prominent chin and a receding hairline. - Does he resemble Mr Altmeyers drawing? - Yes, its not bad at all. But somethings not right. I dont know what. I think its the eyes. - They may be bigger and further apart. - Thank you, Miss Lulu. Now id like to hear what the others think of this sketch. Is this how you remember the suspect? The ladies who work at Pikes Hole will be able to help us the most. Perhaps some of you could give us a more precise description. Its strange. lye seen this man at our establishment several times, but I couldnt describe his eyebrows or his mouth. Could he have been with Sally the night she was killed? - Possibly. Im sure I saw her with him. - No, no. I was sitting at the next table. I saw the man Sally... I mean, the man she waved to. He was wearing dark colours, but he was short and fat. - And he was wearing glasses. - Thats true. I saw him. I was in my cab, outside Pikes Hole. They came out drunk, arguing. Sally was cursing him. He went away looking very sheepish. Judging by her moral indignation, this guy must have demanded some pretty filthy things. - My, was she angry! - What do you mean by “filthy things”? The way you interrogate witnesses is unacceptable for a lady. - With your permission, III wait outside. - No, sit down and be quiet. If factual remarks make you up in arms, thats your problem. At your age, you should know about filthy things. - I protest against... - You dont protest against anything, or well take you into custody. Please continue. - Where was I? - I asked you to define filthy things. - Damn it... - I cant. Sally wouldnt talk about it. But she was really hopping mad. I would have taken her home, but she didnt want that either. I wish I had insisted. She was such a good girl. Yes, they’re all true saints. According to the ladies’ and the coachman’s descriptions, the man was very tall. Look, Miss Higgins. Inspector, you shouldn’t trust those loose women in this case. - Hey, the old mummy’s getting cheeky. - Calm down, please. I couldn’t have known that. Oh dear. So, what do you think of the drawing? The key characteristics seem to have been portrayed perfectly accurately, but I would say that the man was slightly taller and slimmer. - First hes a dwarf, and now hes a giant? - I wish I had her imagination. What can you do, if she wants a bigger one? Yes, good. Very good. Thats what he looks like. We have two different opinions about the killers appearance. - May I say something, Inspector? - Please, go ahead. I believe that we are talking about two different people here. I feel quite certain that the man whom Miss Higgins described and who is also suspected by Miss Lulu is the only one who could have killed Sally Brown. The other one is not worth considering. How can you be so sure? The short, fat one she left the bar with was described as drunk. - Thats right. - The murderer could have breathed on you. He hadnt had a drop of alcohol. I can swear to that. The mouth is similar. I remember it. The lips are a bit thinner, and he has Slavic cheekbones. A lofty brow... Yes, that’s right, the wrinkles on the forehead. The hair doesn’t cover the ears. Rather large ears, they are. Thats him exactly. But he wasnt in our establishment the night Sally was killed. He was there a few nights earlier. He came to my table. Yes, he invited me to his house. He would have paid a lot of money, if Id gone along. - Why didnt you go with him? - I still get a hot flush thinking about it. I said no because I had my period. It was the second day, which is the worst. Cant you at least prevent the most intimate revelations? Thats something perfectly normal. I just say it like it is. Blondie, cant you see she cant remember it? She had her last period in Methuselahs days. - Ladies, you’re at Scotland Yard. - Inspector Selby. What is it? Yes. - Yes. - Reliable. Thanks, Miller. Mr Pritchard, my scepticism about your nose has proved unfounded. They found a thorn when they dissected one of Sally Browns hands. Closer examination has revealed that its from the Aechmea plant, a tropical plant with a very bitter smell. Its the same smell that you had detected on the murderer. What do you think, my friend? Have you seen this man before? Well, the face looks somewhat familiar, but I cant recall where I might have seen it. No. I hope you dont mind that Im picking you up. I had to see you. - Have you had a hard day? - Hard enough. - Oh, lye forgotten my bag. - Never mind. Im used to bigger problems. Just a moment, madam. Well sort this out. - Milady. - Anthony, follow him. That was the killer. No, the other way. - What are you doing? What do you want? - Oh, I’m sorry. - Your behaviour is extremely disconcerting. - It was a mistake. Sir, you are talking to Lord Salisbury, if that means anything to you. Marika! What a minx! Isnt that your ex? Shes put on a lot of weight. She’s putting on quite a show. Well, at least she’s livening up the place. Miss Lulu is lucky to have found her. - That whets your appetite. - Youre such a gourmet. - Flowers, pretty flowers. - Ill have some, please. Keep the change. - I’m a big flirt. - Oh, you too? Hello. There you are. - We could just go for one little drink. - All right, if we must. I really liked the flowers, but why didn’t you wait for me inside? I thought it was too loud and too depraved. Youre a posh one, arent you? You dont mingle with the mob. - Where are you taking me, darling? - Gee up! Youll see where Im taking you. The flower woman said youd probably give me ten shillings. Hey, listen, youre not one of those odd birds, are you? - What do you mean? - You might demand odd things of me. I met a guy once who insisted I go to the cemetery with him. I had to sleep with him on his wifes grave. - You dont want anything like that, do you? - No, I dont want anything like that. Darling. Gee up! - So, where we are we going? Its so far. - Gee up! Where are you taking me? Nobody lives here. Dont scare me. I really dont like jokes. How much longer are we going to drive through the dark? You cant do this to me. Whats the matter? Say something. I dont like this at all. This place gives me the creeps somehow. No! Help! Help! Help! Stop! No! No! Im suffocating. No! Dont! Dont! Please dont! You’ll be glad when we’re finally on tour, won’t you? Yes. And what about your boyfriend, Anthony? Its a shame. Yes, it is. Its unfortunate for him that Scotland Yards search for the killer hasnt been successful. People dont like seeing a Scotland Yard inspector taking home a pretty dancer like you in the evening, while Jack the Ripper is slipping through his fingers. Yes. To make matters worse, the Times prints those readers letters. - Is that you, Charlie? - We have something to discuss. - At this hour? - lye made an effort to come here in secret, so you can be sure that I have my reasons. - But not now. - I think now is the best time. - I dont know why youre here, either. - Dont you? The main thing is that I know. This way, I can jog your memory a bit. I dont understand. Youre talking in riddles. If I were you, I would have a good think. Then you might realise why Im here. Im really sorry, but Im very tired, and I dont want Mrs Baxter to be disturbed. Hold on! Just a minute. I know that you are Jack the Ripper. That will cost you a pretty penny. You do realise that, dont you? Dont worry, I dont want to grass on you. Although I do have enough proof. - More than enough. - How much? 500 guineas, and I’ll leave you alone. - And where should I get the money from? - Your relatives at Buckingham Palace. Doctor? Doctor? Excuse me. What a waste. Look at that, a new girl. Im surprised you still dare to come here. Arent you afraid? Youre just the type hes after. But dont worry, III keep an eye on you. If you protect me, I’ll feel safe. Im honoured by your trust, but what do I get out of it? Its nothing compared to the other one. Hello, pretty child. How about it, you and me? Ill buy you bottle of champagne. - No, thanks. I dont want any champagne. - Well, I never! - Hello. Why don’t you sit down? - No, thanks. I’m looking for someone. What a pity. - Good evening, Ruppert. - Good evening, Inspector. - This is the mother. - Why didnt you inform me earlier? You need your sleep. A gardener from Kensington Park said hed found blood and a womans clothes, so I started an investigation. And thats when the mother, Mrs Stevenson, came. The missing girl is called Marika Stevenson, a girl from the country who used to perform at Pikes Hole as a singer and dancer. Thats where she was last seen. Im Inspector Selby. Your daughters disappearance is really very mysterious. - Has she been found yet? - No. But you shouldnt fear the worst yet. Dont raise false hopes. My Marika always came home. Despite her profession, I could always rely on her, even if she came home very late. She knew I would be worried. But you dont care. You and your policemen are unflappable. While you and your sort are having a good time in posh bars, my poor child is cut into pieces by this guy. But what does it matter? One harlot less means one problem less for you. Why havent you hung this fiend on the nearest lamppost yet? No one helps the poor. No one bats an eyelid, if we get killed. Were the lowest of the low, arent we? - Please calm down. - Come on, madam. - This is really going too far. - Maybe, Ruppert. But she has a point. Hello, this is Inspector Selbys office. Yes, the inspector is here. Hello. No. She hasnt come home? Yes. Has another one disappeared? Cynthia hasnt come home. Don’t be afraid. A small offering for a poor man, please. Yes. Thank you, milady, but what are you doing here, all alone at night? I’m looking for someone. Make sure you dont meet anyone who might be looking for you. - Youd better go home to your parents. - How do you know I... You have such a lovely smell of soap and baths and expensive perfume. But you also smell of camphor, mothballs and suchlike, as if you had dressed up in a costume tonight, as if you were putting on an act and pretending to be something youre not. But your refined speech gives you away. Be careful, my child. This is a dangerous area. Its not the right place for you. - Excuse me...can I still get a drink? - Im sorry, dolly bird. Im closing now. Only a small one. Im in a bad way. Havent made a guinea today. - All right, then. Come in. - Youre a good boy. - The bloody fog. - Yes, it was making me feel queasy. - What would you like? - I dont care. Anything. - A double rum? - Whatever. Its up to you. - Rum it is, then. - If only I wasn’t feeling so sick. - What’s making you feel sick? - Oh, all that shit. - You must be new to the game. - Yes. III go and count the dough now, but hurry up. Considering how much I earned today, it won’t take long. Good evening. I may be mistaken, but haven’t we met before? - It’s possible we’ve crossed paths before. - Why don’t we celebrate our reunion? - All right. - Here or somewhere else? Why not here? Its the same everywhere. - Lets sit down, then. - Yes. - Would you like more rum or champagne? - Id prefer champagne. Dont bother. id better go myself. Sit down. Johnnys a friend of mine. He was just about to close the pub, but perhaps I can still talk him into giving me that bottle of bubbly. Back in a minute. - Is there another exit here? - Yes, that back door. Why? Please run to the police. Jack the Rippers sitting in the pub. - Is he? - It is him. III detain him until you return. - All right, at your own risk. - Yes. - Stop. Nobodys allowed to go in there. - Inspector Selby wants you to stay here. - Are they here? - Theyre waiting for you. - Where are they? - By the stage. Please step aside. Make way. Step aside. - You take charge here. - Please step back. - Thats him. - So, it happened at your establishment? Yes, I was about to close when the girl came asking for a drink. The man didn’t arrive until I was downstairs. And what makes you think that he was Jack the Ripper? The girl was convinced of it. Thats why I went to the police. I see. You might recognise her on this photograph. - Yes, that was her. - I think I saw her too. Oh, did you? Yes, she was here. She came alone. She walked around as if she was looking for someone, but the way she was dressed was completely different. Yes. - No doubt. - Do you think she was looking for you? She was looking for Jack the Ripper. Dont you understand? - Has she gone mad? - She wanted to help me find the killer. - Well, she found him. - And now he’s wondering how we’ll find her. - I think I can give you a clue, Inspector. - Can you? I was at the botanical garden today. I wanted to help you too. In one of the large greenhouses, I noticed this smell, the bitter smell of the tropical plant we talked about, the smell which the killer exuded as well. Thats what I smelled there. You damned whore. Youd have loved that, wouldnt you? You were going to finish me off. You were going to kill me. You hussy. And you killed me long ago. When I was still a child. I loved you. I loved you and hated you at the same time. But now I want your death because all thats left is hatred. And with your blood I will then cleanse myself of all my sins. Look how beautifully the knife is gleaming. But you loved me. How can you kill me? Because youre a whore, mother, a dirty whore. And I want to see you suffer. I want to destroy you the way you destroyed me back then. You dirty... Why arent you laughing? Why are you screaming? Why arent you laughing? You used to be able to laugh. When you wanted to make me angry, you laughed. When I was crying with shame, you laughed. When I didnt want you to caress me with your revolting hands, you laughed. You always tried to caress me, with these gentle fingers that were all tender and warm, even when it was cold. And they were so seductive too. Don’t! No, don’t! No! No! I love you. Youre not like the others. - Doctor! There are enemies outside. Run! - Damn! Cynthia! Cynthia. It was almost too late. Dont ever do that again. You can be certain of that, Anthony. Surrender. Youre not going to get out of here. Weve surrounded the greenhouse. Surrender. Look out! From now on, youII have time to think. Scotland Yard has made quite a catch. You are Jack the Ripper. You will have to prove that first.
