I'll get one at the Battery. They're much bigger there. Thanks, Max. Next time we'll play leapfrog with the Leviathan. Bye, Miss. Oh, so you didn't go to school, huh? No. Catch anything yet? No, but I will. You bet you will. When you get home. Hello, Miss Roberts. Hello, dear. It's been ages. Yes. Is he busy? No. Go right in. Thank you. Yes we've decided to put the Carribean on the coast along Savannah. That'll put the Southern Cross on the Rio-Buenos Aires run until next December. Then she'll join the Amro Central on the West Indies cruises. Fine. That'll give those Dutch ships some competiton. What about the Lloyd affair? I haven't made a decision on that yet. He's taking that up with the Atlantic Conference. Oh, Hello Miss Lovering. You back at work? Yes. She is not. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be out in the air. I was out in the air for two hours. What's the matter? Don't you like a boat? Oh, it's a little slow. It's like a man of war. Like a man of war scared of something. I made West Point in 40 minutes. Well, try it again. Go on, see if you can make it farther. I'm not used to leisure. I want to get back to work. You keep away from that desk. You're not coming back to work yet. But Richard, I'm bursting with health. Well, I don't want you around here anyway. Why? For a very important reason. What? Never mind. You get along to Bruno's at 1 o'clock, get a little booth... Yes and order two sherry flips. And I'll tell you then. Sorry, it can't wait. You gotta tell me now. My wife is back. Her boat got in last night. We're going to have a talk today. Oh, I do hope everything is going to be alright. Why, of course it is. Darling I can't wait for this whole thing to be settled so we can be together. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Mrs. Fields is in the outer office. Ask her to come right in, please. Richard, I must go. No, don't. It'll be alright. How are you, Richard? Fine, thank you. You're looking well. And you look splendid. Younger, somehow. Did you have a pleasant trip? Lovely. You have no idea of the magic of your name on the high seas. This is Dionne Lovering. Oh, yes. I've heard of you. How do you do, Mrs. Field? You're even more beautiful than they say. What did you want, Richard? It must be something very important if you can't say it over the telephone. Excuse me, please. Oh no, please don't go. I'm sure Richard has no secrets from you. It would be less embarassing. Well, of course, if there's anything you're ashamed of. No, Mrs. Field. Dionne and I have nothing to be ashamed of. Very well, then. Let's sit down and talk it over like civilized people. It's rather difficult. What is it, Richard? A divorce? That's it, Louise. I thought so. I don't want you to think this is any sudden fancy. Dionne has been here with me for five years. During all the time of the expansion. You remember, the year you were away on one of your trips. Through these last bad years Dionne has worked beside me day and night, week after week. It wasn't until she broke down and had to leave that I realized how much she meant to me. And I went to her and told her. When I went again she had disappeared. I found that she tried to avoid me because she knew that I was married. I told her that there was no need for that because soon as you got back I knew we could make some arrangement. I see.. She's been very clever. Louise, please. I'm sorry, Richard, but it's out of the question. I don't want a divorce. Why, surely you can't mean that. In all fairness, Louise. Consider what our life is like. I have no complaints. But I can't see what difference a divorce would make to you. I'll get you anything you want. I already have everything I want. I'm perfectly satisfied with things as they are. Well I'm not. Think of my side of it. I want some happiness. I think I have a right to it. Of course you have. And you're very foolish if you don't take it. If you two are really so very much in love... Louise! I'm sorry if I shock you but I've had enough. If the present arrangement doesn't suit you, that's too bad. I like being Mrs. Richard Field. I have a position in society as your wife that I have no intention of giving up. You might as well make up your mind for that. You may be sorry for that attitude, Louise. I've tried to be honourable about this. But if you force me, I'll have to divorce you. Oh, indeed. Consult your lawyer, Richard. You'll find there is no state or country would grant you a divorce if I chose to fight you. And I warn you. I would fight. Goodbye, Miss Lovering. Goodbye, Richard. I'm sorry you had to go through all this. I was so sure... I know. Darling, I can't bear to see you this way. That's the end of everything. Everything that we planned. There just doesn't seem to be any point in going on without you. You don't have to. You don't realize what you're saying. Yes, I do. But it isn't fair to you, I couldn't... I wouldn't care. No. I can't accept a decision made on the spur of the moment. I tell you... you go away first and think it over. But Richard... The Amro Central sails tomorrow. You're going aboard her and you're going to take a nice little trip. The whole thing is too near us now, and when you come back... if you still feel... I shan't change. Here we are, Miss Lovering. Oh, Richard. You shouldn't have. When they heard you were coming they grew overnight. Ah, Monsieur Field. You want Emil? Emil, this is Miss Lovering. She likes crêpes Suzette. Serve them better than you have ever before. And I know that she'd like your pommes d'or, with the sauce and the... Emil, corn beef hash, too... To perfection, mademoiselle. If you don't outdo yourself I'm gonna transfer you aboard one of those banana boats. Bon, bon, bon. Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Still not enough. Darling, I wish you were coming along. No, no. You'll find Amy's very good. Richard, I don't need a maid. You don't want to do her out of a trip, do you? You're the aweetest most unselfish person I've ever known. No, no I'm not. If you knew what I really felt... You will come back, won't you? I promise, Richard. I need you always, darling. You know, I think I'd crack without you now. Oh, dear. Now we won't have time for our cocktail. Soon as the ship sails, you order one from the bar. Only a sherry flip, remember. Always a sherry flip. And I'll have mine ashore. Everyday? Six o'clock. Sherry flip, please. Yes, Mam. Sherry flip twice. The name is John Smith. Honest. John L. Smith Not much in the social registers but kicked around in the hotels. Who are you and how are you? No, really. Yes, please. Please, no! Oh, pretty please with sugar on it. Listen, didn't you ever want to be left alone, not be bothered by anybody? Well didn't you ever get hot and bothered and couldn't help it? Miss or Mrs? It looks like I'll have to go tell the master. Gangway! Michael, drop the housework and come see what little girls are made of. Yeah? Where are they being made? In the bar. Congratulations, Mr. Smith. They're not in order, Mr. Bradley. She was a little distant, I take it. She's a little Antarctica. Is she worth an expedition? Michael, my boy, you came to New York for relaxation. Yes, and I'm fairly relaxed. Ah, you won't know how tired and overworked you are until you've seen this one. Alright, let's go have a look at her. I could get another scotch anyway. She came into the bar and stopped on a hool, I mean, she hopped on a stool beside me. And right then I knew what father meant when he told me about the bee going from flower to flower... Ah, shut the door! Yes, sir. Sometimes I actually have faith in you again. There's a look in your eyes that caeful mothers fear. Not at all. I'm going to prove that I'm a friend with some good advice. You ought to go over there and apologize. I don't think so. It would make me look weak. You're not a tactician. It would clear your deck for future action. Go ahead. Well, maybe you're right. From the hips, huh? Yeah, but don't look like you've got gas pains. Charming lady, after contemplating my rudeness I have come to... Oh, I haven't finished. Go ahead. Dear lady, please don't disappear until you've... Listen, what on earth convinced you that I... It was the shipboard atmosphere, the freedom of the sea... I've watched you, my friend, you've been annoying women long enough. Why you... No backtalk now. Steward, come here. A half hour out and you want to play Jack the Ripper, ey? Listen... I don't know who you are, my friend, but I don't want to see your face on the deck again until you can act like a gentleman, do you understand? Look, he... he... Find out where this would be octopus' bunks so you can lock him up until he's sober. Come along, sir, quickly now before I summon the officers... You just wait. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but notice. Thank you. I suppose he really was harmless. Allow me. An Irish uncle named me Mike Bradley. Well, good for him. Thank you very much, Mr. Bradley. Look here. Your nerves are probably all unstrung from the attack. How about another cocktail? No thanks. I've had my one cocktail for the evening. Well, I'll see you at dinner then. I'm dining in my room and turning in early. Then I'll see you around tomorrow. Yes. Yes, of course. Scotch and soda. Fine. That deserves a drink, you cornfed Judas. The same? Yeah, the same. What's the matter? Did the big rough sailorman hurt little Johnny? Trying to put my head in the letter press. Cost me five slugs to get out. Don't be narrowminded. You were sleighted to be the villain right from the start. Now she thinks I'm the hero. Well one of us has got to make the grade, you see... So you're the hero. The water is warmer than it was yesterday. Are you coming in tomorrow? Yeah! Sure. Yey! Yey yourself! Yey! And good morning. Oh, good morning. How's the water, warm? It's awfully cold. I don't think you'd like it. I'm not chasing you, really. I just turned up here like an old can of soup. The ocean's full of them. Or maybe I'm the polar brushman. No brushes today. How about a groom? Couldn't use it. Tooth brush? Sir? Nailbrush? No. Hairbrush? Oh, go home will you? I haven't any. You haven't any what? Sense. I'm sure of it. Then stop arguing. I'm not arguing. What's the matter? I hope you choke. You're doing pretty well at it. Here. Unhand me! Your eyes are very beautiful. Stop. Even when they're bloodshot. Would you tell me what this is all about? I don't know. But isn't it fun? Yes. Hey, look at me. I'm not such a boogeyman, am I? Just open, honest. There's nothing striking about it but... Come on, let's you and me stand him and her. It's a go, huh? Brian, throw it here! Now we're even. Say, how about that cocktail we were going to have last night for dinner? Can we have it tonight? When are you leaving this boat, Mr. Bradley? I'm going all the way to Buenos Aires. How about you go? All the way to Buenos Aires. Is that game Dinah? Dinah? Yes, yes, I know. The passenger list calls you Miss Diane Lovering. But I call you Dinah. In heaven's name, why? Well I had a black-faced doll when I was about a year and a half old... I called her Dinah. I loved her very dearly. I couldn't go to sleep unless she slept under my bed every night in a shoebox. I'm sorry. I don't see the comparison. Except that Diane reminds me of Dinah, that's all. Oh. You see. There you go getting petty, yeah, yeah. Look, I'm out for laughs, Dinah, that's all. Good. Yeah, and you look kind of silly as you are... Oh, very silly. And I'm not a year and a half old anymore. Wait a minute. We're playing a game. Oh, pardon me. I forgot, Mam. Holy cat's Neptune! There must be a hole in the bottom of the boat. Let's have a look. Well. What's the idea? Six thirty, you said. You're 15 minutes early. Am I? Then I'm an extraordinary woman. Ahead of time, ahead of everything. What are you having? I don't know. What's yours? Sherry flip. Sherry flip? What's the matter? Are you ill? Seasick? No, not in the least. Sherry flip? They give that to people with stomach trouble and the gout. They serve it in old people's homes on Christmas. But you see, I happen to like it. Doesn't fit in with the rest of you at all. It's the nicest cocktail I know. Well I'm going to appoint myself a committee of one to show you a cocktail that is a cocktail. Two Daiquiris. You know, the way you fixed them last night, with Jamaica rhum. And go easy with that syrup. No, none for me Oh, but I insist. That's just soap and water. There's not tang, no feeling, no ecstasy, no oomph to it. Where's our good friend Johnny Smith? I don't know. I left him tying his tie. It was like he was trying to lynch himself. What are you and Johnny going to Buenos Aires for? He's in with the younger rats down there. Oh, frontiersman, huh? Am I that much of a hick? I guess these trips and all will take care of that. Yeah, they help. Here. A couple of these and you'll find yourself up in the crow's nest. Well? Very nice, but... But what? May I please have another sherry flip? Sure. Steward. Miss Lovering wants another sherry flip. That's a flop. Yes, sir. Dinah, you're very beautiful, but you're liar. Oh, hello. I thought you said you were going to bed. I came out here to listen to the music for awhile. How about listening in there and dancing? No, I'm too comfortable here. You're a problem girl, aren't you, Dinah? No. Why? You're a problem to me and sometimes I think you're a problem to yourself. What did you come on this trip for? The ride? Uh-huh. Darn long ride. I wanted a long ride. Who's the guy? What guy? You know, every once in awhile your eyes are way out there in the horizon. There must be a guy behind a woman's eyes when they're like that. Will you listen to the conceited male. No, honest now, are you engaged to be married? No. Would that be one of my problems? Well, it might be. Ever been engaged? No. Say, who have you known all of your life? A lot of blind men? Ah, si, es mucho, mucho guapo. Oh, there you are. Folks, meet the sisters Belmonte. They don't speak a word of English but hold your hats because we're picking up momentum. Como está usted? Muy bien, gracias. Are you speaking to me? I don't know why not. Then you're a fine, upstanding woman and I deserve to lose you. Come on. Buenas noches, you big stiff. That takes care of Mr. Smith for the rest of the trip. Shame to spoil your chances, Mr. Bradley. Besides I'm about ready for sleep. Now wait a minute... Better hurry. No, they're not my tipe. You were looking for trouble when you came aboard, now admit it. I do. Well, there's your chance. Now run along with Dinah's blessing. I admit I was on the prowl until you dropped down from the sky. Yes, but I'm not trouble. We've decided that. I know. But I've decided you're something else. Good nignt, Mike Bradley. You're on the edge of something very silly. It doesn't seem so. Of course I've never been this close to the edge before. We'll forget you ever said that. Alright, until the day I can make you remember it. Good night. Good night. Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Neptune doesn't know what to do with his queen. Maybe his beard's in the way. Forty times around. Are you holding up? I'm holding back nothing. Good. Miss Pinkles and I have just about decided that you two set the nicest pace in the boat. We like to walk fast. So do we. I think we'd make a nice little score, you might say. We'll all have to do this every afternoon. I can't keep up with you. My legs are too short. They touch the ground, don't they? Hey! Look at the whales! What whales? Where? Whales? Where? There! See? Right there. Gosh, I thought I saw some whales. Oh, you don't suppose... not again! Oh, poor, dear Mr. Bradley. What's the matter with him? Nothing. You see... Oh, they told me a sea voyage would help me... I won't go back to that room. I won't be locked up in that place again. You must be quiet, Mr. Bradley. Isn't it tragic? Come. Let's go Edith. Ok, it worked. Yeah, let's let it work some more. You're on overtime now. Having fun? I've never had so much fun in my life. But there's always tomorrow morning at dawn when they harbour in Buenos Aires. Oh, don't be so challenging. All those mysterious problems of yours gone? Come on, Mike. We're supposed to be having fun. That's a feeble word for it. Isn't it glorious? Where's the Southern Cross? Right up there. Where? Here. Right along the line of my finger, see? Oh, I see. How beautiful. You're telling me. You want to come out and see my ranch while you're here? I'm afraid I won't have time. I only have two days and I have some shopping and things to do. Where are you stopping? With some friends. Oh, who are they? The Wilsons. The Wilsons? Uh-huh. I never heard of them. I've lived around here for ten years and know everybody in town. Well, you see, they just moved down here last winter. Look here, Dinah. What's behind all this? Are you still afraid of me? Why should I be afraid of you, Mr. Bradley? Because you still think I'm a boogeyman, I guess. Don't be silly. You know. It's all wrong. We were never meant to end this way. We were never meant for anything else. Goodbye, Mike Bradley. Alright. Goodbye, Dinah. Same old thing, ei? Shipboard friends and never meet again. That's right. I don't believe it. You must. I still don't believe it. So long, Dinah. This telegram came with the flowers. Thank you. And what are your plans for the day, Miss Lovering? I arrange entertaining. I really don't know. Perhaps a motorcar to ride around the city? No. Or perhaps, we have excellent bridled pairs. Everyone rides in Argentina. Perhaps a horse? Yes, I think I'd like that. At 10 o'clock? At ten, very well. You have breakfasted? Oh, yes, thank you. On the boat. Of course. How stupid of me. Say, this is mighty pretty. Just Mr. Field to send those flowers. He's always so thoughtful. Yes, always, Amy. Everywhere. Oh, but I'm glad to get off that old boat and get my feet on good firm ground again. I guess that is the best way to look at it. To look at what? Nothing. Oh, darling, don't you feel good? I should, shouldn't I? I know what it is. You just haven't waked up yet. Yes, I have. That's the trouble. I'm wide awake. And I'm afraid to open my eyes. I've never known the sun could be so warm and strong beating down on me. I can't open my eyes to look at it. Maybe what I thought was the sun was just a temporary sunstroke, so skip it. Alright. Is the horse ready? I shall call the stables, Miss Lovering. Yes, and a guide, too. Somebody who knows. Yes, yes, sure. Here's the guide. The horses await out at the Bradley ranch and the Bradley car awaits without. Oh, but you frightened me. I'm still a boogeyman, ei? No, but how did you happen to be here? Oh, I just thought I'd drop by and say hello to the Wilsons... Nice little cottage they have here. Lots of servants, guests... Are they home? No, but they left word for me to mind the children. I was just taking the twins out on the Plaza to see the execution. Well, well, the oldest is tall for his age, isn't he? Or do they have him stretched? No fooling, Mike. Are you a bloodhound or is this accidental? A bloodhound that can read trunk checks when a lady carelessly leaves her trunks outside her state room. You know all my doings. There's the rub. Mr. Piazza's a friend of mine. And he owes me money. So he's the one that told you I was going shopping at ten. Exactly. And I thought you would know about our stores down here. You know they don't like horses trotting up and down their aisles, jumping over the counters... I thought maybe you'd like to do your shopping out at the Bradley ranch where horses are horses and not candidates for the bullring. I'd love to, Mike. This is better than I hoped. Now if I could just learn and play that trombone and sing Dixie, I'd really be proud of it. I'm afraid I was on your neck most of the time, fella. Stay away from that nasty perch you're on, lady. That loon will cripple you up on your first day in Argentine. Four hours. Wash the sweat out of him. No water until sundown. Si, señor. Oh, it was glorious, Johnny. You should have been with us. Johnny isn't much into riding. He keeps to the office and watches out for the business here. Yeah, that's the reason I stay off of the horse. And now I can look at this place. Not much to witness and to woo in. Oh, I don't know about that. How many women have seen it? A darn few. How about some lunch? I could eat a horse. I wish you would. If he had anything to do with the ordering you'd probably get mule meat. Pablo, how about some lunch? Señor Mike, she's beautiful! Shut up. You haven't got anything but beans? I wring the neck of two chickens... and I make them broiled. Ah, she's beautiful, ai, ai. Bring it on. And along this wall we have some of the old family portraits. That is great-great grandfather Bradley in an odd moment. Very aristocratic nose. And over here is... Mr. Smith's and Gertrude's by a distant marriage. Lovely hair. Yes, she just washed it. Can't do a thing with it. Oh, food! Oh, Mike, can I? Can I now? Oh, sure. We lost all of our forks last year. Here. Snap at the raddish. Excellent raddish. Gathered by Pablo's own lily-white hands. Excellent milk. Hmmm. Thank you. I gather the milk by the hand too. What? I say I swoosh, swoosh, swoosh. Hey, hey... We know, we know. Outside, pronto. My apologies. As I said before, we're not used to fare visitors. It's a situation I've been trying to correct. But old colonel Bradley here, he's a man's man with his horses, dogs and his pipes. And sure hopes that major Smith will continue to entertain his lady friends in town. Your plantation needs women folk. Not like the last one he brought out here. She had such pretty gold teeth. Uppers and lowers. Anyhow, here's luck to Johnny Smith. And Mike Bradley. And that's in the wine of the country. That's pretty. Oh, go on. I bet you'd like to do it yourself. In fact I think I will. Good. I wish I could wear a belt all the time. What for? It's so good when you loosen it. Quite a guy on a nag, isn't he? He certainly is. What else is the matter with him, between you and me? Absolutely nothing that I know of. It's what I thought. Then why don't you give him a break? Well, Johnny... OK, I get it. Not enough high voltage where it's gotta be, huh? OK, you were great with me from the start and you're still great. That little guinea pig is gonna grow up into a vicious unpleasant animal that'll bite me. But he's a cute little devil. I gotta see that little fella. You're doing it at your own risk. Come help with those mares. They're wilder than pheasants. That's where I get tattooed with a pair of iron semicyrcles. Dinah, meet Chilibeans Hello Chili. All full of beans and pepper. Pretty hot, huh? You betcha. What a cold, wet nose you have. Tell her she shouldn't smell so sweet, Chili. Aw, Mike, you don't sell pretty things like these, do you? Not this one. It's grandmother once won the sweepstakes for me and saved the mortgage. He's got a lot of horses to show his heels to. You see. We're pretty harmless out here, just like a day nursery. And you were going to try and run away. Why? I'll head him off. Dinah. That's why I lied and ran away. It's nothing to run away from, is it? Just there you and I rushed high above the earth. I don't know where, but we were all alone together. Up there in the sun. We're going to settle down up there. This is Mike Bradley. Now I know that's all I ever wanted you to say. You didn't act that way. I didn't dare to even think of it. Why not? Mike, there is another man. He's married. Has been all along. I understand. No, you don't. You see, he's never asked anything of me. Even after his wife refused him a divorce in front of me. I tried to tell him it didn't make any difference. But he thought only of me and not of himself. You know, Dinah, he must be pretty regular for you to... Mike... I've never really known anything until you put your arms around me. I thought I loved him. He's gentle, honest, dear. And I owe him everything. This trip... I even owe him you. Well, you're going to write him and... No. I'm gonna go back and tell him. There's no reason for that. It wouldn't be fair if I didn't. And I promised him I would come back. I know I can make him understand if I see him. It would only double his hurt if I didn't. We couldn't be happy any other way, could we, Mike? No. Alright. Hurry back. Lionel Thompson of The Tribune, Mr. Field, how about a statement about... Sorry boys, you'll have to excuse me today. Just one word, Mr Field... Dionne, darling. Hello, Richard. Oh, not in front of all these people. I don't care. Come here and let me take a look at you. It's almost worthwhile letting you get away just for this moment. But getting off this way? What about the customs? Oh, Emil will handle all that. Oh, hello Amy. Here's as a courtesy to the porter. Amy stay aboard and look after the luggage, will you? So you've come back. Have a good time? Yes, Richard. Nice people aboard the boat? Yes. A little tired, aren't you? No. Perhaps a little excited about getting back? I've so many things to tell you I quite don't know where to begin. Well, Miss Lovering, glad to see you back, mam. Thank you, Henry. Do you happen to have flowers like those in Buenos Aires? Dear Richard. Do you want to look in the other room? Something in there too. No, not yet. Darling... Hm? Come here a minute. What, dear? I want to tell you something. Give me your hand. I want to be sure I'm not dreaming. Go on. Do you remember when you set me off in that boat? You said... Please let me finish. I know what you're going to say and it doesn't matter. I'm not going to listen any longer. I was going to let you discover this for yourself, but if you insist on talking. Oh, dear, you mustn't. Not another word until you've looked. Looked? In there. Go ahead. What's this? A welcome home present. A wedding ring? Read the morning paper. See what you think. Richard. I can't believe it... It's true, dear. Louise and I had it out again shortly after you left. I won't have quite as much as I hoped to spend on lovely things for you. But thank heavens she finally listened to reason. What's the matter, dear? Can't you believe it yet? It's just the surprise, I guess. I know. When you left I didn't dream it could be done either. Then it's all settled? It'll be final in three weeks. The only thing that held it up was the question of the children, Really... your boys. What about them? She won't let me see them. She knew the way to punish me. My dear. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters but you. You've given up your family, your home and your children. You must love me very much. Your being here showed me that I love you more than I ever knew. Couldn't do a thing downtown. Just wondered about you. What you were doing. Waiting for you to come back. Here you are in my arms again. You know, I used to come up here often. It helped bring you closer to me. Richard... Hm? Am I really that much of your world? You're all of my world, dear. If I should ever I lose you I... I don't want to think about that. No. We won't think about that ever again. What's so funny? Dinah... You know. if I didn't know that you were brought up in honkytonk I'd have you broken on the wheel. Get those scary boots out of there. She's beautiful. Get out of here! Love has turned you humorless and harsh. Honestly, Johnny, don't you think she'll like it? No. It's perfect. Except for the fact that the girl deserves better. I'll say. Mr. Bradly, la correspondencia. Si, si. Ah, her first letter. Give it here and I'll read it out loud. What's the matter? It seems he's a chump and his name is Bradley. They're all alike, aren't they? Yeah. Only some aren't so frank about the class of business they're in. I'd have never have dreamed it about her. It's brutal. And I had thought it was the works. Furniture, a new addition, a dump cart. I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah. Well, what the... Give me a drink, will ya? Sure fella. How do you do, Mrs Field? How do you do? Will you come in, Roy? Mrs. Field, you came for the gun? Yes. It's ready. It was only a minor repair. A thrust in the... Sorry, I wouldn't know a thing about it. Just as long as it pleases Mr. Field. It must do that. I wonder if you could tell me where I could find a little thing like a toboggan. On the mezzanine, Mrs. Field. Roy, would you wait for the gun. Yes, mam. Let me see your other gun there. Yes, sir. Mike. Hello. Well, hello. Fancy seeing you here in your own hometown. How are you, Diane. This is a surprise. Yes. How long have you been out here? I don't know, two, three weeks, I guess. Is Johnny with you? No, he's recovering from his last trip to New York. Where are you stopping? St. Regis. Shall I put this in the car, mam? Mrs. Field? What, Roy? Shall I put this in the car? Oh, yes, thank you. Here, sir. What? Here's something new, sir. Ah, yes. I'm thinking of taking back some artillery. I have my car outside. May I drop you somewhere? Nice little buckboard. No thanks, I'll walk. Alright. Well, have you decided on the gun? What's the idea? I thought I'd like to walk too. No sale today. Maybe tomorrow. Alright, come on. Has Johnny been well and happy? Sure. You look pretty well. Yes, I can't complain. I'm glad, Mike. So am I. Where are you heading? I'm supposed to be at the colony for luncheon. Oh. Well, this is my cision going west. Oh, but... How much longer will you be in town? I don't know. Three or four days I guess. Well, Diana, keep up the good luck and I'll tell Johnny I saw you. Couldn't we please go someplace where we can talk? Yes. Providing you can break your luncheon date and have lunch with me. Anything you like. And providing you let me pick the place. Anywhere. Well I guess that's fair enough, isn't it? I do so want to talk to you. Yeah, sure. Yes, sir. Well, how's South America? Still on the map. Where's Felix? Oh, he's around. Felix! Ah, Mr. Bradley. Gald to see you. The last time I was here you were a crook. How does it feel to be honest? You wish to lunch in the bar, Mr. Bradley? No, we want to go someplace where we can hear ourselves talk. Ah, upstairs. Mademoiselle's coat? Sure, sure. How about your hat? There is a mirror. Cocktails, first? Alright, why not? Lets see, what was that pale, anaemic concoction you used to... I'll have what you have, Mike. Alright, two daiquiris. Two daiquiris. Subito. And now for lunch. Soup? Consommée? Some minestrone, perhaps? No, look Felix, you've always done right by me so bring what you... I'm sorry, Diane. Oh, anything Mike. You order. Alright, Felix. Do your stuff. Be sure it sticks with the ribs. I'll take good care of you, as always. Well, does it suit? Is this where... I mean, do you come here often when you're in New York? First time, this trip. Oh, that's right. You never did, did you? Stupid of me. It's quite a pleasant little place for out-of-towners and some of the citizens too. Thank you. Mike... Come in. Cocktails, sir. Alright. Well, what will we drink to? To Johnny? Ah, he's a scoundrel. He isn't worth it. Who is? Is anybody? Oh, I know, of course. To Chilibean. Alright. To Chilibean. He must be a big grown up horse by now. How is he? I don't know. I sold him. Some more? Some Bénédictine, Miss? Thank you, no. No? Anything else? Nothing else. Just ring if you want me. Well, Mrs. Field, That's the first time you've ever called me like that. OK, it's the last. While we're on it, how's it working out? Splendidly. For you and for him both. Of course. That's fine. How's his health? Why, he... Do I really deserve that much, Mike? I'm sorry if you felt that below the belt. I didn't mean it. Skip it. Skip it. You're the same healthy girl, aren't you? Not a doctor's bill, not a dentist appointment, not even a... Not even a son, huh? What? A son. Don't you remember? We talked about it once when we were going to settle down for life or something. Mike... Well, that's out and I don't blame you. But we'd blame ourselves if we didn't take an hour or two of it now that they've stopped the clock for us, huh? What's the idea? Do you like to run away and be caught? Really, I must go. I don't know why I came here. I don't know why I even spoke to you. No, Mike. Not that way. How else? Much sweeter. Dinah. Dinah. I've waited so long to hear you say that. Dinah, why did you do it? What? Why did you send that letter and let make me spend a year thinking of you... you as just a... I thought I owed you the truth, Mike. Like a poor daffy kid I believed you... But only because I was counting the days, I guess. It was true then and it's true now. Only this is true. You here saying meaningless words while all the rest of you keeps telling me differently every second. Mike, Some men and women... well they are drawn to each other... sort of a spark that flares up like a skyrocket every now and then... Are you trying to turn the sun, our sun, into a firecracker? It can't be done, Dinah. I guess it can't be done. So you see, that changes everything. Nothing's changed. There's Richard. There always shall be. Why didn't you tell hem... Oh, darling, he had already given up everything I couldn't let him down then, Mike. He has turned his whole world, his whole life over to me in front of everybody. I can't ask him to take it back now. It would disappear and he would be alone. How about you? Me? What about us? Grin and bear it? No, now that I know, do you think that I'll stand by and... Please, Mike. This can only mean one thing for us. I thought I'd rather have you hate me than love me. Now I know why I spoke to you today. Because I hoped your eyes wouldn't be so hard. They were and now they're not again. It's the only way I could think of them and go on, Mike. Dinah, Dinah, don't go. I must. Then I've got to see you again. Tomorrow? I'm going away tomorrow, I'm going to be busy. Where are you going? Goodbye, Mike. Darling. Do you realize what you're doing? Yes. I'm keeping you locked deep in my heart where nobody else will ever be. Where only I can talk to you not ever seeing you again. Listen for me in your heart, Mike. Always. Well, James. Is Mrs. Field in? Yes, sir. Good. Hello, darling. Oh, hello, darling. Well, all packed, I see. Yes, Amy's done wonders. Good, I'm hungry. What's for dinner? Really, I don't know. Ah, that's the first time I've caught you. Beginning to forget your household duties already, ei? I'm sorry, Richard. It won't happen again. Oh... I see you got the gun. Yes. I hope it's alright. It had better be. Get your toboggan? Toboggan? How stupid of me. I forgot all about it. So that's my girl with the efficient head for remembering. Talks about the toboggan all week then goes ahead and forgets it. I can have one sent up by express. All through at the office? Yeah, all cleaned up. Good, then you can sleep late in the morning and stay around the house with me until we leave for the train. I can't. Got a board of governers meeting at the club almost all day. As long as I'm in town I have to attend. Richard. Yes, dear. Richard, I've a marvelous idea. Name it. Let's not wait for that stuffy train trip tomorrow night. Let's get to bed early, get up early and take open car and every fur robe in the house and motor up. If we leave at seven we can make Placid by six no matter how much snow. Pretty cold ride. That'll whisk the little cobwebs out of our brains. I'll have them put a hot furnace and a hamper of food and... Are you as anxious as all that to get away on our little holiday? Hm-hm. I'm complimented. That's just what we'll do. I'll tell Roy and we'll get away at dawn. Yes, Richard. Good morning, James. Good morning, madam. Would you have your breakfast now? No, I'll wait for Mr. Field. This is Mr. Field's home? Yes, sir. Tell him that Mr. Bradley is here and would like to speak to him. I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid I can't disturb him just now... James, that's alright. You might bring the coffee now. Mr. Field will be down in a moment. What are you doing here? I've come to settle this Dinah. But I told you... It's the only way. You won't do anything about it, so I must. If he's as fair as you say he is, he wouldn't want you to go on this way. Mike, I won't let you. I've made up my mind. Dione! Oh, please go now. No. You have nothing to do with this. This is between him and me. Dione. Yes? Where are you? Here. Richard, this is Mr. Bradley. How do you do? How are you? I met Mr. Bradley on the boat last year. Oh, I'm delighted. Well, why don't you come in? I told him I couldn't disturb you. That's alright. Come on in. You'll catch cold here, Dione. Staying up here? No, I just got in on the train this morning. I tried to reach you at the office. There's something I want to talk to you about. Business? Richard, I told Mr. Bradley you were on a vacation and you weren't to be bothered. My guardian. Keeping watch over me. I think we can make an exception for a friend of yours. Well, let me take your coat. No, thank you. No, you must. Have you had breakfast? No, not yet. Well, join us. And we can talk afterwards. You haven't eaten yet, have you Dione? No, not yet. Good, then come on. No, thank you. At least a cup of coffee. It can wait until then, can't it? Very well. Good. Set another place for Mr. Bradley, please, James. Yes, sir. This air up here has given me an appetite already. Is that your brilliant idea, James? No, sir. Mrs. Field ordered that. I'm a very fortunate man. Sit down, Mr. Bradley. Bt the way, did I happen to say good morning to you? No. Then a very good morning to you. Are you sure? No, not a thing, thanks. So you two met on the boat. Hm-hm. Yes. Why didn't you look us up before? This is my first trip to New York since then. I'm going back in a few days, that's why I wanted to see you. Oh, you live down there. Yes, I have a ranch. Horses and cattle. I envy you. This is the only touch of country life I have. And I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Dione. Ship any of your cattle and horses up here? Yes, some cattle. I hope you use our boats. No, your rates are too high. Well, we have to see about that. My animals are healthy. They can travel on a slower boat. Saves money. Good economics. Where did you learn that? I was at Yale. I'm Harvard. What class were you? 26. I was 1906. 1906. That's a long time ago, isn't it? You know that's almost before you two were born? Oh, Richard. Are you ready for your coffee now, darling? Thanks. I think I'll be going. But I thought... Well I see now I had no right to break in on you like this... You know, those wide open spaces make one a little uncivilized. Why, but your business? Well, it was only about the shipping rates. That can be taken care of just as well by mail. Well, I'll give it my special attention. I'm sorry you won't stay. Are you sure you won't have anything? Yes, I would like a drink. I have a cold trip ahead of me. Of course. Thank you. This'll keep you warm. Here you are. Here's to your health. In the wine of the country. Thanks. I'll get your coat. Give my love to Johnny. Tell him I hope he will be well and happy. This is goodbye. Yes. This is grand weather you're having up here. Yes, isn't it? Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye, old man. Darling. Yes? Look at me. What is it? You don't have to pretend anymore. I know. I've known there was something wrong ever since you came back. I could see you trying to hide it. I wanted to ask you again and again. I was afraid. Oh, Richard. Forgive me. Forgive you? Darling, I've had more happiness with you in this last year than most men have in their whole lives. I see that I had no right to that happiness. I stole it. No. Yes. It's true. But it isn't too late to make ammends. Is it? Let's play post office. I have a letter for Mrs. Mike Bradley. Hey look, you were the bestman in name only. Wait until you're out and around next week. Mike, it's from Richard. He's up at camp in Maine. That's great. With his two boys. We'll send him some fancy juicy beef for a barbecue. On his own line too. Couldn't you make it a horse? He heard me. Sra. Bradley. Yes. Breakfast. She's ready. Thanks. Let's get it. She's beautiful. Get out of here.
