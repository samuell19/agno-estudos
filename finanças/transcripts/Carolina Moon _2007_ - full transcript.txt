This is where the russian plane went down. yes, that's what my instruments are telling me. we have to retrieve the nuclear warhead before they send their rescue force. come on, already. the geiger counter is going crazy. it's here. i found it. i found the warhead. tory, what is it? what's wrong? are you having a vision? yes. somebody's watching us. who? i can't tell. it's... blank. leave us alone! it's getting late. i better go. we have to meet tonight to plan the attack on enemy headquarters. right here, 8:35 sharp. i'll bring the lemonade. no! it's just your brother and my cousin. ho, if mom found out you were swimming without a grown-up around -- if mom found out, there would be one less cade lavelle in the world. you won't tell my parents, will you, wade? i don't know, cuz. what's it worth to you? you guys said you were gonna wait up on me. mommy, mommy, i was so scared in the woods all alone. what if a snake came and bit me on my extra, double, giant-sized butt? oh, my god, it's a cottonmouth. aah! where is it?! you guys are such jerks! better a jerk than a dweeb. * dwight the dweeb * dwight the dweeb * dwight the dweeb * dwight the dweeb * dwight the dweeb boys are such bores. don't forget about tonight. the woods are full of enemy spies. we need a password. adventure. make us ever grateful for thy mercy, lord. whosoever turneth against thy commandments shalt thou smite with pain of the spirit and torment of the flesh. amen. the blackberries are coming in so big and ripe. i might want to get in a little canning this week -- make a nice jelly. mm-mmm, i love that blackberry jelly. i know i've got some paraffin around here somewhere -- if i could just think where it's gone to. gone to? i work myself black and blue every day of the week with the lord, and you wonder where the things i buy for you have gone to. it's on the top shelf of the cabinet above the stove behind the molasses and the cornstarch. well, how do you know where the wax is, victoria... ...up where you can't see it, you can't reach it... unless the devil showed it to you in one of your visions. she must have seen me put it up -- shut your piehole. a year -- a whole year since last canning season... and you remember... ...that it's exactly between the molasses and the cornstarch. i'm sorry, daddy. it just came to me. i promise i won't do it again. open the door, victoria. baby, baby, when the devil's got a child under his power, who's gonna set her free if her daddy doesn't? hmm? mom. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. hey, faith. want to play jacks? hope, you're making me lose count. people say twins think alike. 47, 48. hope, where are you going? to meet tory. please don't tell. cade. you wouldn't have any idea where hope's got herself to, would you? she's hiding in my closet. it's some dumb game she's playing. oh, well, somebody has a ballet lesson she needs to be well-rested for, and it's almost 7:30. faith, did you see the new toothbrush i bought you? you are the best brother in the world. can i go with you? why would you want to? * cade and tory sitting in an tree * i hate you. * k-i-s-s-i-n-g * first comes love, then comes marriage * * then comes baby in the baby carriage * password? password? tory? it's okay if you can't remember the password. just... just come out, okay? tory! no. no! go away. run! tory! ever since that terrible august, i have missed hope, as i miss the part of me that died with her. the day my father took us away, not a week after hope was put in the ground, i had no idea that it would be 18 years before i'd come home again. funny how in the pictures there was a plant right in front of that crack in the window. you bet you'll be right down here to take care of it. thank you. don't kill your favorite cousin. wade, i'm so happy to see you. i can't believe it's been three years. i kept meaning to come back up to new york and visit, but, you know, i'm opening my own practice and all. just tell me that this place is totally beautiful and i am gonna be a huge success, and i'll forgive you anything. yeah, it's, uh -- it's terrific. just one little question. in god's name, why? "in god's name, why," what? you know perfectly well "in god's name, why" what. make yourself useful. this whole area is booming -- all those new families who are dying to fill their houses with high-end, handcrafted housewares that i am here to sell them. there's a thousand cute, booming yuppified towns in the state. why here? why go chasing restless ghosts and bad memories? it turns out that restless ghosts and bad memories know their way to every town i've ever run away to. i can't keep running. i cannot keep letting them win. it's not just the ghosts. you should hear the living. "you know who's opening that new store on main street? "the girl whose daddy killed hope lavelle and got away with it." which may or may not be true. what is true is that he's only 100 miles up the interstate and just as piss mean as ever. and on work furlough for hitting that cop and has to punch in every morning, or back to prison, right? yeah, yeah, every morning till the one morning he decides not to. he can't hurt me now. he can't hurt me ever again. that's why i came home... ...so i'd finally believe that. at least come and stay with me until you find a place. i found a place. i'm renting the cabin. the cabin? the lavelles have fixed it up like new. no, tory. not out there, where -- wade, it's what i need to do. i'm not gonna change my mind. oh, now... now, this, you are not gonna believe. tory, i'd like you to meet a fine local contractor who also happens to be the recently elected mayor of progress, north carolina -- dwight collier. it's good to see you, tory. dwight?! you mean dwight the dw-- go ahead and say it. "dweeb" -- it's a badge of honor i wear with pride. all the hell i suffered was the best thing that ever happened to me. it got me running 10 miles a day, sneaking into the gym every night, doing everything i could to break the curse. 10 miles a day -- hell, once a dweeb, always a dweeb. and look what all that hard work got me. that cannot be tory bodeen. you're lissy harlowe. lissy harlowe collier. it never was the same around here without you. and how's your sweet, old mom and dad doing? you know, tory's had a long drive, and i've got to get her something to eat, so we'll see you guys later. welcome home, tory. tory, get that box. tory. you've got to see this. whoa, his belly looks like five. cade. cade, come here. just a sec. you better go. tory, get in the car. tory? are you here? cade? oh. kincade anthony lavelle, to be exact. wanted to stop by, see if you needed anything. i'm fine. everybody's talking about the new store opening on main street. talk is good, considering the size of my advertising budget. you grew into your eyes. when i was 12, they used to scare me. when you were 12, you were too busy running around like a monkey with my cousin and dwight to notice me. there was a space of time when i noticed everything about you. i still carry that picture of you around in my head. is there something you want? is that what you think? everybody wants something? i have about three months' work to do in three weeks. i should get started. you just let me know if there's any problems with the cabin. your sister's home. "home for a visit" home or "home" home? well, that was fast. we'll have dinner. cade! make me a whiskey and soda, hold the soda. welcome home, faith. do you know what the problem marrying a country-western singer is? all those pretty songs put a tear in your eye. all that... * i cheated on you, darling, but i love you * * you're the best friend i got besides my bottle * well, it all turns out to be nonfiction. cade... that was lissy collier on the phone. please tell me we're not going to rent the cabin to her. lissy collier? lissy's moving out on dwight? to victoria bodeen. she's opening some kind of a store on main street. she's not gonna be any trouble to you, mom. no... no trouble at all, except every time i walk down main street and have to see her face. she was 10 years old. old enough to run away and save her own skin. and old enough to protect the person she saw doing it. she wasn't there. so you subscribe to the "my favorite martian" version of the story? she was able to tell us exactly where the body was because she picked it up on her little antenna. i don't care what alibi the police chose to swallow. her father raped and murdered your sister and threw her away like a broken doll, and i can't believe that you would allow her to live on our property. mom... and why did she have to turn up in august? of all months. put your bags away, faith. what the hell is tory bodeen doing back here? well, darling... a person could ask the same thing about you. i will studiously ignore that. why did great-granddaddy have to build this gloomy, old castle instead of a nice, white plantation like everybody else? and why is it i can't wait to get back home, and then 10 minutes after i'm here, i feel like the life is being strangled out of me? you know, i think you'll find the nightlife in progress hasn't really improved much since you left. well, then, that's about to change, isn't it? you tell robby to give you two of these pills twice a day, and if he forgets, you call me up so i can give him a what for. do you think he heard me? there you go. see you, robby. you really should look into the lock on that back door. you're a married woman. well, then, how about i read some magazines while you wait for the annulment papers to go through? faith... ...don't do this to me again. oh, now, look at this. it seems there's a whole new frontier opening up in homeopathic care for household pets. take it off! she never liked me. she never said boo to me. she just stared at me with those spooky eyes, like she knew just what i was thinking. she had plenty to say to hope, though, till i came along, and then she'd clam right up. what does she want to move back into her old place for? she's probably as crazy as people used to say. no, she's not crazy. she's lonely. sometimes, lonely people come home because there's no other place to go. you know, maybe tomorrow night we can park under those big, old oak trees -- i don't know what my plans are for tomorrow. i've got to get going. it's my first night home and all. what? i'll call you tomorrow. tory. tory, wake up. i'm glad you came back, tory. i didn't come that night. i guess you weren't supposed to. but you're supposed to be here now because... 'cause there were more, and there's gonna be more until you stop it. until i stop what? you have to be careful, and you have to be smart. tory bodeen -- girl spy. hope, that's not why i came back. i came back so i could stop being so afraid. there's only 18 more days. till the 23rd? the anniversary? i know that, but i really -- you have to wake up now. something's coming. dwight? after hope... ...were there any more incidents like that? no, he never struck again -- not around these parts, anyway. he certainly left his mark, though. august 23rd is never a very happy day around here. cade came by. he, um... seems the same. the prince of progress, through and through. never a hope he'll let you forget it. he must have his fair share of prospective princesses, huh? that man has left a trail of broken female hearts that would make the devil weep with sorrow. i'll call you with an estimate. i really appreciate this. the lard-ass dweeb and the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. us outsiders got to stick together. bye. oh, i'm sorry. we're not open. you sure aren't very friendly to a potential customer. just like hope all grown up, huh? sorry, wrong virtue. i'm faith. ooh. very nice. very nice. now, that's something i couldn't even find in charlotte. the cabin is awfully rustic for someone of your sophisticated taste. but then, i suppose you never needed much. that was always the difference between you and me. you never needed much, and i always needed everything. did you ever get it? still collecting. so, i take it you believe in second chances. yes, i do. that only works if you're lucky enough not to give a damn about things like guilt and consequences. are you lucky? i travel light, and i travel often. so do i. it looks like we landed in the same place this time. no reason that should be a problem. as long as you remember who got here first. it's hard on my mother -- you being back here. don't make it any harder. hi, i was wondering if i could get that picture for the star-register now. sorry, i'm really not put together right now. that's just how we want it. just like that. i missed you over at work this morning. don't parole officers ever sleep a little late? i'm gonna have to piss-test you, han. you think i'd risk testing dirty with nine years in that place hanging over me? with you, han, i never know what to think. just go behind there. ugh! you forgot your magic bracelets. wonder woman can't work wonders without her magic bracelets. i'll get this end. no, it's all right. i don't need any help. well, we all need help. i can handle it. and you're almost contrary enough for me to let you. however, i am trapped by my superior breeding. oh, man, what kind of bed is this? iron. why? did you forget your cape, superman? or should i just call you mr. kent? whoo. so, when are you gonna ask me? ask what? how i knew where to find her. how i knew what happened. i don't have to. some people think that i was -- not me. so, if you believe that i'm possessed of unnatural powers, aren't you afraid that i'm gonna dig up your dark secrets and sell them to your enemies? or do you expect stock tips? 'cause i don't do the future, just the present and the past. are you gonna show off and tell me what i had for lunch today? or you gonna run and get your toolbox so we can put this sucker together? i lost 25 pounds in 2 months. set it and... forget it. forget it. forget it. you slide the food in, and it pops right out. i hope you had some good times with that cute irish setter you've been running around with, 'cause, pal, those days are about to be behind you. but it's all ahead of us, big boy. well, that's quite a dress. guess what i have on underneath it. it's not locked. don't you like to live dangerously, dr. mooney? what? oh, guess what i found. those detectives that your father hired after hope died -- did they ever come up with any leads? zero. i'm glad i'm not the only one who still wants the answer. is that what you came back here for? yesterday, i would have said no, but now... i know you all think that my father did it. your mama swore up and down that your dad never left the house that night. he could have done it. i saw inside his head more times than i wanted to -- ugly swirl of self-righteousness and blind hatred. but when i saw inside the person's head who did it, it's blank, like a tv after the station goes off -- nothing. dwight certainly changed. oh, yeah, well, sometimes i feel bad about the way we used to treat him. but to be honest, if i had known what a peacock he was gonna turn into, i would have treated him worse. well, he got lissy. that'll have to be justice enough for now. mm-hmm. so, do you want to get some dinner later? dinner? nothing fancy. no tablecloths, no candles. just, you know, pizza and a movie? i'm not that good with people, tablecloths or not. and you're opening a store. in a store, things are real simple. okay, well, then i shall graciously take my leave. my superior breeding in action once again. i really appreciate your help. all right. half a ham sandwich with swiss and brown mustard -- that's what you had for lunch. you gave the other half to that skinny, black dog who always comes begging every time he sees you in the fields. 8:00 at o'rourke's? oh. and all i thought i was having for lunch today was a blt and a soda. oh. you know, baby, that old collins place is for sale. i know it's a wreck, but, you know, it sure would be fun to restore it to its former glory. and with you cracking the whip over the work crew... oh. look, what do you want, faith? huh? you want me to treat you like trash? just like all those deadbeats you left town chasing after? i haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. i see your brother leaving, dressed in a more civilized manner than usual. where is he going? somewhere dark and quiet where he can grope tory bodeen. so, if you don't spray the weed, how do you kill the pests? the chemicals kill the pests, but they also kill the good bugs, contaminate birds, get into the groundwater. you spray today, and a kid two towns over drinks it tomorrow. so, you're not in business for the money? organic products command a premium in the marketplace. as i tried to tell my father, who lived just long enough to tell me that i was destroying what it took my ancestors 200 years to build. but not long enough to know he was wrong? i'm not wrong yet. mmm. mmm. mm-hmm. i did not do that. well, do you want to not do that some more? mmm. oh. cade! what? you're insane. you're, like, 80 steps ahead of me. you can't just say, "let's go back to your place and --" you didn't say that out loud, did you? that is why we're just meant to stay friendly neighbors. apart from the fact that i may die from terminal embarrassment, that reason would be? because i know where this goes, and nobody close to me is ever safe. who's business is it how safe or unsafe i'm interested in being? tory, what you have is a great gift. it's a gift that screwed up every job, relationship, and home i've ever had. dwight's delivering the cabinets at 7:00 a.m., and i should get an early night. let go! stop! stop! stop! pull over! what are you seeing? her girlfriend ditched her for some boy, so she's going to hitchhike. she thinks it's cool to get in some truck and drink whiskey. no! i hate this! i don't want this! let's go! let's just get out of here! no! he takes her in there. she's crying. he's grunting, sweating, and panting on top of her. no, no, no. don't go in there. don't go in there. i'm just gonna call the police. it was 12 years ago. she was 16 years old. her name was alice, but she didn't like that, so everybody just called her ali. we need to call the police or the fbi. there's a reason that it reached out and got me like that. it was the same blank space. it's the same person who killed hope. oh, shoot. mrs. lavelle. can i fix you a cup of coffee? i've had my coffee, thank you. forgive me if i jump right in. i can't have you in this town. i know you know why that is. yes, i know why that is. mrs. lavelle, i know there's a way -- i can imagine the effort and expense you've put into setting up your store. i am willing to recompense you everything you spent, plus whatever it'll cost you to set up someplace else. i can write you a check for $25,000 now and another $25,000 when you get wherever you go. that certainly is a fair amount of money. well, i'm glad you think so. i'm not leaving, and where you got the idea that i would ever, for one second, consider taking your money -- it didn't take much imagination. your father cleared out for five grand. i had nothing to do with what happened to hope. and you didn't have anything to do with what happened in new york when you killed that boy. what was his name? josiah. no, jonah. jonah mansfield. you think my detectives haven't watched every move every member of your family has made in the last 18 years? you think you could hide from me? i wasn't hiding from you. i was hiding from my father. and i did not kill jonah mansfield. that is not what the police said. i want you to go now. i guess now we all just wait and see who dies next. it will just be part-time on the afternoons when i'm not teaching. well, i hadn't really thought about hiring, not until i open the store and see how it's doing. it's not gonna be easy to run the place solo. no breaks. no time to do paperwork or check inventory. well, yes, but i really don't -- i've sold everything from tractors to tap-dance lessons. and i just love the stuff you're selling here. i want to steal every single piece of it. oh, i mean, not that i would. do you have a -- a résumé? right here. oh, and a dog, too -- a guaranteed customer magnet. hi, mongo. see? one's coming in right now. sherry, thank you. i'll give you a call. it was great to meet you. did you get a call back from the fbi? he sent a fax. her name was alice powell. they found her in those trees near the highway. she was 16, just like you said. tory, it happened august 23, 1995. that's six years later to the day. it gets worse. it's part of a bigger file. there are 13 unsolved cases that fit the profile -- all slim, all blondes, all raped and strangled on august the 23rd in different years, all over the country -- missouri, ohio, florida. and they were all different ages -- a 14-year-old girl back in '94, a senior at chapel hill in '98. they're all the age that hope would have been the year they died. he's killing her over and over again once a year. and it's august the 10th. listen, tory, we might be able to help if you can just let me tell my friend that you've got this. no. there's nothing more that i can do. please, don't ask me that again. just tell him that my father is a suspect, and they should look into that. i'll go call him now. are you gonna be all right? yeah. i just have to... keep busy. who am i kidding? i've got to get out of here. i'm gonna go visit hope. you haven't been out there yet? no. but i want to go now. i'm so sorry to intrude. i'm leaving. screw being sorry. i was always the worst to you -- the scared, "please don't hate me," little mouse you always were. do you like what my father did with the place? it's beautiful. yeah, either that, or kind of creepy. i could never decide which. it takes courage to take something ugly and make it peaceful and beautiful. it takes lots of courage to drink yourself to death in front of your family. he lost a child. i lost a sister. so did i. i don't know what i hate more -- that you just said that... or that i know that it's true. she wanted to play jacks that night. but, no, i was too busy brushing my hair. i always said no to her. god, no wonder she had to find another sister. i was supposed to meet her. i knew she was out in the woods alone. i didn't go. i should have played with her. you couldn't have known, faith. i did. oh. oh, god. what? i just felt like we were just competing in a game show, like "american idol" or something. trying to convince the judges who's the guiltiest? yeah. and then the audience calls in with their votes, and the winner gets an all-expense-paid trip for two to hell. what are you doing? there's someone there. is this one of your psychic things? what are you -- who's there? i don't know. it's blank. but he's coming that way. we've got to run. run? oh, to hell with running. come on out, you chicken-assed son of a bitch. i think you need to take that magic radar in for a tune-up. here, just in case. oh. no, i -- i've got plenty more back home. tory, i got a call from your mother. your father beat up his parole officer to the tune of 62 stitches and a wire in her jaw. he hasn't been heard from since. why did she call you? scared. running out of money. she knows where he is. she's hiding him. the thought did cross through my mind. that's why i'm heading up there and why i'd like your company -- to get her to cough him up. wade, the store is opening in five days. it's just been so long since she's seen you. it might make all the difference. you didn't say she was coming. hello, mama. you always were right there on the scene when there was trouble. don't talk that way, aunt sara. we're here to help. get that lying bitch parole officer to tell the truth. that slut got beat up by one of her boyfriends. now she's trying to pin it on my han. why don't we sit down? tory, you think you can make us some coffee? i've got some instant left. now, if han's innocent, he needs to step forward and say that. the longer he stays on the run, the worse it's gonna get for him. you think i wouldn't go to him if i knew where he was? i just thought that maybe you'd remembered a couple of places he'd go to cool off, you know? sleep off a night of drinking. are you saying my han's a drunk? that man works hard. he needs to relax sometimes. jesus drank wine, didn't he? everybody's wanting money. i went to the bank, but those sneaking liars took what we had in there and then said han withdrew all the funds. you can come stay with me. i can't go anywhere. a man's got a right to expect his wife to be waiting for him under the roof that he puts over her head. i can see the sky through the holes in your roof, mama, just like i could when i was little. nothing was ever good enough for her. why did she come? she turned her back on me a long time ago. you turned your back on me the first time you stayed quiet while he beat me bloody. a thousand times, i told you, "don't set him off." but you never learned. is that how you're able to sleep at night? by telling yourself that? i'm gonna rip your devil eyes out of you devil head! if you or dad ever raise your hand to me again, you'd better pray you beat me dead this time! i'll be in the car. it's okay. i think she needs her boosters and her dpt. what a sweetheart. oh, you do not even know. so, can i walk in, or do i need an appointment? you can walk in anytime. dr. mooney's at your disposal. great. well, i'd better get back to work. lissy would surely kill you for that little glance. it's worth dying for. speaking of the better half, it's tupperware night at the collier house. you want to go out and get seriously drunk? i can't. i kind of made some tentative plans. haven't you been making those tentative plans since you were about 15 years old? aren't you tired of being penciled in? i should have killed you in high school, when i had the chance. tory. oh, my lord, it is so beautiful. thank you. and so brave to choose a location where -- how many is it now, five? no, six new stores have crashed and burned. oh, now look at this little beauty. an artist outside of charlotte makes those for me. i don't know if it's really me. lissy, i am so impressed by you. how do you always manage to tighten that belt and live within your means? actually, you know what? i think i'll take the necklace and the matching earrings, if you don't mind parting with them. i will get you a box for these. good choice, huh? you just paid my next month and a half's rent. well, pain in the ass though he may be, i am, in fact, embarrassingly fond of my brother. tory, i don't often see him smile, let alone eight days before the 23rd of august. and then you come into town, and half a dozen pizza dinners later, he can't seem to stop. faith, cade and i -- we're just friends. oh, yeah, yeah. so, you want to come by after the opening? um... i'm not sure what my plans are yet, but i'll call you, okay? okay. let me take you out to celebrate? oh, i think once this is over, all i'm gonna want to do is crawl into bed. well, we could do that, too, but a little dinner first might be nice. oh. just how drunk are you thinking of getting? well, there's delmonico's in winter haven. or that new place in port kingston. mmm, yeah, the homemade special. well, there's... always o'rourke's. mmm, o'rourke's -- always a safe bet. oh, uh, we'd better get going. yeah, uh, o'rourke's. okay. i'll get my coat. ooh. oh. oh, i'm sorry. no, i'm sorry. no, i'm sorry. no, i'm sorry. i was moving a little too fast. my head... it's like a multiplex. it's got all these movies playing at the same time. when i walk down the street, i get all these people. they're thinking. they're scheming and blaming, just coming at me, so you spend your life building up walls to keep it out. and then you meet someone that you want to -- you want to be with. but you're too scared to take him down. have you ever taken him down? yeah. new york. i saw this picture on a milk carton. and i saw where the kid was, on a beach in florida. the cop on the case -- his name was jack. we fell in love, and we kept finding kids together. well, that made him a star. stars have groupies, and he -- he liked that. he liked that a lot. and i could see it in his head. he hated me for it. and i freaked out, and i messed up with one of the kids, and then i just ran. i kept running. well, let me tell you the difference between that guy and me. when that guy was growing up, he didn't wish you'd come back home every time he got the long end of a wishbone or blew his candles out on his birthday cake or saw the first star in the sky. and that's too bad for him, 'cause he never got to see all of his wishes come true better than he ever hoped. just let your walls down, tory. i'm letting mine down. look at me. look at me. dr. mooney. wade? tory, you have to wake up now. it's almost time for him to do it again. one week from tomorrow. he likes to hurt girls. it makes him feel important. it makes him feel like a man. who is it, hope? it's your turn now, tory. he was watching us while we were making love. i saw more this time. he let his guard down. he was -- he was touching himself. for a split second, i saw inside his head. i saw what he wanted that night. he wanted both of us. but he only got hope. it's your father. i don't know. maybe. but it's my turn. that's what hope said. if you have any questions, just ask. i'm gonna get you full-time protection. dwight's gonna have the cops circle by any chance they get. okay. where is it? oh. that's bad. right where you can get it, every second. who's the bitch you slept with last night?! i swear... she means nothing to me. don't you dare joke around about this! i came by 10:00, and i was here till 3:00 in the morning! you hung around waiting for me all that time? oh, i hate you. you know, i don't recall us having plans, faith. you don't like to make plans. but it was saturday night. you had to know i'd come by. no, faith. i don't know anything. you don't want me to know anything. i went out drinking with dwight. if i had been with another woman, i would have been free to do so, same as you are. isn't that the way you want it? i never said that. well, you never said different. well, i'm saying different now. oh. well, you want to change things. oh, well, if that's the case, then i'm gonna start adding some of my rules to the game. no more, "i'll let you know." and we start acting like we give two damns about each other, or we walk away. i'm in love with you, faith. are you crazy? don't say that. yeah, i guess i shouldn't, 'cause every time i do, she seems to run away and marry somebody else. i do not. that's not true. what do you want me to do? that's for you to figure out. i just know i'm not settling for crumbs anymore. and, meanwhile, your puppy... my puppy? ...needs to eat. there's food in the kitchen. i -- no. no, i'm not taking her. look at her. she loves you. no, wade, i don't -- no. she'll pee on the carpet and chew on my shoes. i've got to shower. wade, is this some kind of test? thank you. come back. thank you, ladies. you have skills, girl. oh, stop. oh, it looks like mongo caught us another customer. welcome to southern comfort. well, thank you for that. hello, tory. it's been a while. sherry, this is my father. oh, you must be so proud of your daughter and what she's done here. hardly a day goes by i don't think of it... and her. sherry, why don't you run those pots down to the post office? um... well, we still have an hour. jane bicroe is too important a customer for us to take any chances on. yes, boss. well, it was very nice to meet you, mr. bodeen. you came back. what do you want? back to where the shame of what you did and what you were drove me from my home. margaret lavelle's money drove you from your home. your new friends? watching out for you while daddy's on the loose? you smile and wave, tory. i don't have much to lose. they catch me, i'm going to jail. the lavelles paid me to take from their sight the demon that brought death to their child. you will see hell for what you are. is that how it works? only get to go to heaven if you beat your little girl and leave your wife to starve! aah! aah! i need money -- everything you got in there. take it. just take it. come on. look at me. you tell anybody i was here, i will come back and do what i should have done the minute you were born. "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." aah! tory, what are you doing?! oh, god. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i thought he came back. oh, my god. were you robbed? did you call the police? no, i don't need to call the police. are you crazy? it was my father. who are you calling? cade, then dwight, then the police. he took the money. he's gone. i don't want you to call anybody. you don't always get what you want. come on. pick up. who's this? watch the gun. this is bee, as in "queen bee." we were gonna drop $300 on a set of puppy bows. weren't we, precious? cade, wherever your butt is, get it down to tory's store right this second. you're not spending one second alone or unguarded until your father is behind bars, not one second. who's gonna guard you? talk, bee. talk. oh! isn't mama's baby just the smartest pup that ever lived? oh, and isn't mama just the bestest, most responsible dog owner ever, ever? ever, ever? she ran out into the road -- right in front of me! i tried to swerve, but she just -- calm down. i know this dog. it belongs to the girl who works in tory's store. faith, i'm gonna need your help. gentlemen, you're gonna have to be patient. okay, girl, we're just gonna lay you down on the table, okay? good girl. good girl. okay. oh, good, no broken ribs. maybe a bruised kidney. the leg's the worst of it. okay, faith, i need you to grab that towel and press above where she's bleeding. um, wade, are you gonna operate right now? we're gonna operate. she's got internal bleeding. when i need an instrument, i'll describe it, and you give it to me, handle first, okay? wade, i -- i can't. faith, i'm all alone here. i need you. you can do it. okay. okay? press right there. yeah, right there, good. now press it. there. good. oh. it's okay. it's okay. there we go. that's better. are you okay? you okay? no, i haven't seen her. actually, i need her to come in. i left a couple messages. i was about to stop by her house. is mongo okay? yeah, she will be. sherry is probably out looking for her, so i'm gonna meet you over there, okay? okay, bye. oh, my god, wade, i had no idea what it was that you did. i thought it was all about giving out shots and cleaning up poop. you just saved a life. no, we saved a life. you were awesome. would you just shut up and be my hero for one minute? and how steady his hands were. and blood was gushing out all over the place, and he never so much as flinched. he was just like george clooney, only sexier. the door's open. she must be home. don't! she's dead. what? it's funny, faith. knowing you as well as i do, i'd say you poked your head in that door -- curiosity, if nothing else. obviously, you don't know me as well as you think. so, you just got, like, a hunch there was a dead body? i'm a big believer in hunches ever since the day when one of tory's hunches lead us to where hope lavelle lay dead in the woods -- that and those hunches you followed in new york city a few years back. we didn't want to let on that we knew, but we need your help. what happened in new york's got nothing to do with this. three kids made it back home because you had hunches. and one didn't. three did. that was one efficient killer at work in there. there's no sign of whatever he used to tie her up with, no fingerprints, no footprints in the rug. i'd like you to go in there with us and tell us what you can see. what makes you think that i can help? somebody's been planning this. they knew her dog. they knew how to get into her house. and i have been here the whole time, and what good did i do her? hey. his name was jonah mansfield. i was so messed up over what was going on with the guy, i got it wrong. i thought it was one kidnapper. he died when the police went in. he was 7 years old. and sherry bellows was fine until she walked into my store. hey, look, you did not kill sherry bellows. you did not kill jonah mansfield or hope. the end of the story is always the same -- someone's dead and i'm running. running where? raleigh for tonight. i'll figure out how to close the store down and take it from there. no. i'm going, too -- to the ends of the earth if that's where you're headed. so you can die trying to protect me? i'm not gonna let that happen. tory. i'm saying goodbye. you have to let me go. she's in the kitchen. she's cooking dinner for her and mongo. she turns the music on. she likes to have noise around her while she cooks. there's somebody else here. he's feeding mongo... drugging her. she turns. she's met him before. she doesn't understand. "don't touch me," she says. "i'll do anything." she knows what he's going to do. no, please don't touch me! he throws her! he throws her down on the ground! he punches her. ties her hands behind her back. he takes a condom out. she wants to be anywhere else but here. she can hear the music in the other room. it hurts. it hurts. he puts his hands around her neck. she can't fight anymore. who is he? he's disappointed. he didn't want her. he wanted somebody else. he dropped something. he did leave something behind. he... here, it's... it's my father's hair. sherry met him when he came into my store. if you're saying that this was your father, then i got to bring that to the fbi, and they're gonna go straight to your mother. and if i know sara, then anybody with a government badge comes knocking on her door, she's gonna clam right up. if her own people get there first, you and wade -- i tried it. she's not gonna talk to me. she hates me. it's different now he's wanted for murder. if she hides him, she's an accessory. tory. hey, you can't go in there. get back here. hey. hey, hey, you can't be in here. this is a crime scene. it's her mother. steady. steady. you want to get his head right between those two notches. now give her a nice, steady squeeze. why do i feel more grief for sherry bellows, who i only knew a couple weeks, than i do for my mother? you used up your grieving for sara a long time ago. squeeze, now. don't pull. so, you want to get married or what? what, are you gonna make me get down on one knee? with everything that is going on and i've only been back three weeks, that's not just crazy. that's just plain stupid. that's what they said about my great-grandpa -- horace vanderbilt lavelle. he met a girl on one of the lifeboats of the s.s. titanic. he proposed to her the day the rescue ship docked one week later. they were married 71 years, had 11 children, and her name was on his lips the day that he died. you're not thinking straight. i've got to get ready for work. yeah, so do i. i'll have faith come by here. i'll tell her to bring her ak-47. she loves that little thing. don't you ever want to put your talents to use, go to vegas, hit the blackjack tables? it's not something to profit from, faith. oh, oh, i forgot. this is the terminally serious miss victoria bodeen we're talking about. i am psychic, therefore i must suffer. knowing my luck, i'd just get the dealer's childhood traumas. uh... faith. uh... i left my hair clip in the car. do you mind going to get that for me? what's wrong? nothing. i just need my hair clip. tory, we're gonna have to give you lying lessons one day. what's going on? he's coming from the back. just go out the front and run for help. no, we can't both go. then he'll get us both. just go! go! you lied. you told you saw me. there's more cops in this town than... mosquitoes. i don't have any money here. don't. you don't ever get to lay a hand on me again. mama didn't have enough money for you this time? is that why you killed her? you're even crazier than i am. now put that down. get your daddy some lemonade. we'll have us a family talk. aah! you never did have any balls. no one ever said that about me! i told you to go. i went... to get my gun and call the police. are you shot? did he shoot you? no, you shot him. oh, thank god. oh, my god. that's my car. i left the keys in it. tory, get out of the road! tory! oh, my god! tory, snap out of it. oh, my god. oh. oh, god -- wade. i want my wade. cade! are you okay? are you guys okay? i heard the sirens. i saw the explosion. oh, my god. he's dead. i felt him dying. okay. all right, let's get to the house. the police will want to talk to you. all right? oh, god. i can still feel him. he's watching. no. no, baby, those are just the echoes. he's dead. he's gone. it's over. come on. it's okay. let's go. when do i get to actually feel like it's over? like he isn't standing right behind me? once we clear the 23rd -- just 4 more days. yeah. hmm? when do i get to find out why you brought me here? well, there hasn't been a lot of rain. but it's enough. soil holds more water when it isn't full of chemicals. my father had to water twice as much just to fight off the growth regulators he sprayed on the stuff. that's how it was done. if you do things differently, you have to prove yourself. how much do i have to prove to you, tory? what are you talking about? most people have treated you a certain way. that's all you know. i've tried to do things different. so, i brought you here to show you that i finish what i start. what belongs to me gets everything that i've got. you make me so happy just the way everything is. why do you have to change that? well, that's a first -- telling me that i make you happy. it's so obvious. nothing's obvious to guys. don't you know that? tory... do you love me? yes, but i don't know if i'm ready -- i've just got to get something from my home. you mean beaux reves? i can't go there. of course you can. it's just a house. it's my house. come on. i'm not allowed in the front rooms, just the kitchen. those are the rules. well, i'm sure once upon a time, when you were barefoot and covered in swamp mud, those rules served a good purpose. just hold on a second, okay? it's in my office. catch. that was my grandmother's. then it came to me. cade, i need to talk with you. why don't you come on down? we'll talk in the den. just you and me. well, then it will have to wait. wasn't "the guest is king" always house rule number one within these hallowed halls? not every girl whose pants you get into counts as a guest. i'll be leaving now. please don't. the last thing i ever thought i'd hear from you was pure, low-down bad manners. i can't have her in this house. oh, good. a party. anybody care for a gin fizz? you're talking about the girl i'm hoping to marry, mom. what do you expect from me? my blessings? yes, i would like that. i want your blessings more than i can say. but you don't need to keep doing this. the man who killed hope is gone. i can't have this house fall into the hands of the girl who left her to die. if you let that happen, i'll go to the board and have you fired from lavelle farms. then i'll fight it, and i'll win. not if faith throws in her shares with me. and what makes you think that faith is gonna do that? she's out of an inheritance if she doesn't. actually, faith doesn't need an inheritance anymore. faith's got a job at tory's store. she does? yes, she does. can we stop talking about me in the third person, please? if you stand against me, i will leave this house, and we will have nothing more to say to each other. would you stop being the outraged confederate matriarch? they closed that show a long time ago. mama, people go on from things, even the death of a child. i pray to god you never have to find out how wrong you are about that. if i were god, you know what i'd answer? "uh, margaret, last time i checked, "you had two other children that had the distinction of still being alive." two children who love you very much. believe it or not. mrs. lavelle, please don't make him choose between us. i had another child who chose you. she paid a very high price. i should never have let her anywhere near you... or your family. mama, you couldn't have stopped her if you tried. i'll be going to the lake house. i'll send for my things. cade, talk to her. don't let her leave like that. i'll talk to her when she's cooled down. i'm not gonna get through to her, though. will she really leave? yeah, if she does, it just might save her life... not to mention mine. if you even think about letting margaret lavelle's lunacy get in the way of even one millionth of a molecule of your happiness with cade, i will personally kill you. bye now. i don't want a girlfriend. i want to spend my life with you. i want to have a family with you. tory, will you marry me? why does this scare me more than my father ever did? well, it's a yes-or-no question. yes. she loved him -- your grandmother. his name was timothy, and hers was laura. and they were happy. with rain and sun coming in, it's hard to tell exactly what kind of august 23rd you're gonna have. so bring your sunscreen and your umbrella, and you should be just fine. you know what they say at the piedmont -- "if you don't like the weather, just wait a minute." so, looking ahead at the next couple... aunt sara had a harder life than she needed and a harder death than she deserved. but she's at peace now. i should have brought her flowers. no, i never bring her flowers here. i always go to the place in the woods. that was her place. i'm so sorry for your loss, tory. if there's anything i can do, be sure to call. i will. thank you. you know, hope loved marigolds, and they're going crazy right now at beaux reves. you want to pick some and meet me up there about 2:00? we can tell her it's all over. faith, i wish i felt that way. you will. you will. with time, we all will. i can't believe i'm condescending to be friends with tory bodeen. i hope you know that i only pay $6.75 an hour, and there is no commission on sales. well, i hope you know that i'm gonna kick such royal ass that you will be begging me to accept equal partnership by christmas. all right, if you get there before me, don't -- i'll wait for you. hello, tory. cade! we got the ballistics reports. the gun that killed sara wasn't the one bodeen had on him when he died. the one he did have was reported stolen from a house 30 miles south of here between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. monday night. sara's neighbors -- they reported hearing gunshots at 7:30 p.m. a hundred miles north of here. so unless he sprouted wings and flew -- yeah, well, the times must be wrong. who else would have killed tory's mom? the times aren't wrong. look, if bodeen didn't kill sara, maybe he didn't kill any of them. then whoever did is still out there walking free. you have any idea where tory is? yeah, she's... ...she's with hope. faith's coming. she'll be here any second. no, she won't. i asked lissy to drop in on her. you know lissy, once she gets to talking. why did you kill hope? you were 12 years old. cade or wade, first at everything. first to get drunk. first to smoke a cigarette. well, i was gonna be the first one to get a girl. me -- the fat kid, the sissy. i was gonna get two girls if i was lucky. not that i'd be able to brag about it. it would have to be my little secret, kind of like being batman. i didn't know i was gonna kill her. that just kind of happened. i drank some of my daddy's whiskey. drank like a man, you know? "come on, you fat slob! be a man!" you can't be a man if you're a virgin. that night changed my life. that night was perfect. all those other girls -- i was just trying to get that one perfect moment back. you were gone. faith would have done, but the way her parents watched her, i couldn't get within 50 feet of her. i made do with tramps and losers. and when you came back, i was afraid you were gonna see what i was thinking. but i know how to fill my head with noise and block you out. you never got through. even when i was standing next to you at hope's funeral, wiping sad, little tears from my eye. now, sherry, she wasn't part of the plan. but the way cade had you surrounded 24/7, i had to do something to get your guard down. i had to pin it all on somebody else. who better than han? and that just left -- my mother? what if she told the cops that han was with her at the time of the murder? i snuck up there on tuesday night. i took a little hair out of your daddy's brush. the reason i couldn't see you is 'cause there's nothing there. how about i show you a little bit of that nothing? this is gonna be perfect. tory bodeen -- girl spy -- face-to-face with the forces of darkness. he's too strong. she can't keep fighting. he's strong, but she's smart. and everything she needs is right in front of her. open your eyes, tory. oh, thank god, you're here. she went crazy. it's him. he killed hope. he was here waiting for me. you killed my sister? no, she's insane. you knew tory was coming out here. you were standing with her and faith at the cemetery. it was her that killed hope. she killed all of them. there was never any physical evidence of a rape. it's because it wasn't a guy, it was her. telling us where hope's body was, telling us it was her father's hair in the rug -- i suspected her for a long time, and she knew it. that's why she asked me to meet her out here. now, carl, you've got to get me to a hospital. i'm gonna lose this eye. she was with me the night her mother died. he's had this sick obsession with her since he was 10 years old. he's lying, carl! he tried to kill me! i've got a man hurt here, tory. you're holding the weapon that did it. she's telling you the truth! you cool down! you hear me?! now, i need to get dwight to a hospital, and then i'll question the both of them. no, 'cause then he's gonna ditch the gun that he killed my mother with. he let me in his head. i saw it. it's behind his back, under his shirt. carl, that's the whole point. this psychic thing, it's a con. well, how about you just lift the back of your shirt? i'm dying here! just search him! he can't do that without a warrant. you take that up with the judge, dwight. lift your shirt. don't move. senseless tragedy. tory bodeen shoots her boyfriend and the chief of police, and then she turns the gun on herself. how could a thing like that happen in a town like progress? dwight, don't move! it's coiling! it's gonna strike! i'm gonna kill you. i'm gonna kill you! cade, no. cade, no, no! stop! no! don't do it. we're not him. we're not him, cade. we got more coming, chief. it's collier. get collier. mr. collier, you have the right to remain silent. if you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. you have the right to speak to an attorney. it's over now, hope... for real. wade, when we get engaged, will you buy me a sapphire instead of a diamond? and a nice one -- not too big or gaudy, mind you. square cut. are you proposing to me? hell, no! no self-respecting southern belle would ever lower herself to such a thing. let's go home. tory!
