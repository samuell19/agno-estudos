If you know of anyone who could use me services... um... one of your nieces, perhaps? Samantha, Mrs. H is the soul of discretion. One would never know she'd been but for the polish on my knobs.

Oh, um... you wouldn't mind waiting until next week, would you? Well, uh, the thing is, it's become a bit pressing because I need to... Oh, is that the time? Actually, Mrs. Harris, I'm afraid I'm going to have to reduce your hours. Reduce? N-No, please. Milady, please... Well, we all have to economize these days, don't we? Sorry.

That's good. Oh, we got a good spot. Right. Oh. Wish me luck. - Oh, Ada. - Come on, Haute Couture. Oh, look, she's in the lead! Come on! It's in front. Come on! It's Clever Count, Blue Streak, and Stormy Bay. And would you look at that... Haute Couture has just woken up and remembered what she's here for. Well... Hats off to you, girl. You went for it. I'll go find a St John's Ambulance. They might have a tot of brandy. For me. You were right, Vi... All that money. My Eddie'd be ashamed of me. I'll be right back, huh? Nothing wrong with dreaming, Ada, hmm? When I came to London, the streets were paved with my dreams. That's what you are. You're a dreamer. Plain as the nose on your face. Give over, Vi. I'm all right. Mrs. Harris? Mrs. Edward Harris? It's about your husband. Sit down, please. Sergeant Harris wasn't declared missing in action until April the 19th. Uh, yeah, that's when I got the telegram. It's a day after his birthday. Ah, yes. Well, um, as we now know, Flight Polo Lima 326 crashed on March the 2nd, 1944, meaning that Sergeant Harris was paid for almost seven weeks after his death. At, um, six shillings a day. Is that what you come to tell me? After all this time. That my Eddie owes you back pay? When he never owed a penny in his life. When he give up his life for king and country. You got a nerve. Coming into my home, drinking my tea, blackening his name. - Um... - How much do you want? How much? And then you can leave. I-I think you've got the wrong end of the stick. Oh, have I? Well, I'll tell you where you can shove your stick in a minute, - if you don't watch out. - Oh, golly, no. Um, I, uh... I'm here to give you money, Mrs. Harris, - not-not to take it from you. - I've had enough of... What'd you say? Y-Yes. Righto. Uh, you should have been receiving a-a war widow's pension since 1944. It comes to quite a tidy sum, uh, with that small deduction. So long as you haven't remarried. Oh, give over. He might have come back any minute, I'd have looked a right Charlie. Uh... well... I suppose you'd better sit down. Have that cup of tea after all. Um, no milk. She's never done a thing wrong her whole life, sir. She went a bit crazy on account of some dress, but she's fine now. Nothing to worry about. - Oh, hello. - Mrs. Harris? You come to tell me I got the crown jewels? She's still not right in the head. Almost. That diamond clip you handed in... The owner wants to give you a reward for being an honest citizen. Oh! She is, sir, honest to a fault. Come in and have a cup of tea. Don't mind if I do. Thank you. Oh, come on, Vi. We can have a knees-up. Oi, wait for me. And, uh, you might want to break out the bubbly. You having another lucky day, Archie? As a matter of fact, I am, and so are you. News travels fast. So, that bet you put on that two-legged dog... Oh, y-yeah, don't... don't worry about that. I've come to me senses. No, the boss was there, so I had to take the money, but I managed to hold back a tenner. You shouldn't have done that, Archie. You could have got into trouble. All tickety-boo, Mrs. Harris? Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you had company. Hello. What's going on here? - Oh. - For the love of Mike. - Uh, I'll see you later. - Uh, no, Archie, Archie. Uh, can you just give me a moment? It-it's personal. - That the kettle calling? - Ah, righto. What's going on? Something up? It's a long story. What were you saying? So, I took your money and put it on a sure thing in the last race. And, um... your stake back and a wee bit more. Oh, n-no, Archie, I couldn't. - I... - It's your money. Take it. I can't keep it, woman. PC Plod in there would have my license. Come on. Just promise me a dance at the Legion. Thanks, Archie. Much obliged. Blimey. Are we flying? We're terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen. There seems to be a fault with one engine. There will be a slight delay while we try and fix the problem. Delay? How long? I've got to be there and back in a day. Oh, God. Paris. Righto, Paris, here I come. It's a fair old walk. Oh. Um... bonjour. Beg your pardon? Hey. Thank you. Yeah. Um, I'm here to buy a dress. From Dior. Dior? Ah, oui. Me also. Is it far... Dior? Oh... 20 minutes. Uh, but after you take wine, two hours. I walk you there. Tomorrow morning, eh? Oh, no, no, thanks. I couldn't, no. All right, go on, then. Oh, blimey. Why is all this rubbish on the streets? The big boss cheats... - The worker, yes? - Yeah, yeah. The worker say, "No more." The binmen are on strike? Ah, yes. Now all Paris, uh, smells, uh... uh, like me. Oh, God. You are a noble woman. And remember, in France, the worker is king. Oh, miss! You all right, love? - Did you hurt yourself? - No. Sorry. Thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes. Oh. Miss? Miss! No, miss. Ooh-ooh! Miss! Miss? Here you go. Once again, you save me, madame. - Oh. - I'm sorry. I'm very late. - Oh. - Thank you. It's all right. As long as you're in one piece. Ooh. Ooh, uh... Oh. Excuse me, dear. Where would I find the frocks? I fear you have the wrong address, madame. I will call someone to show you the way. No. No, no. Sorry. I'm-I'm... I'm after a frock. One of them 500-pound ones. Please, if you could wait over here, somebody will attend you directly. Now, hang on. Excuse me. Madame, I-I was here first, before any of this lot. Ain't you heard of queuing? Excuse me. Look, I'm sorry. -Please. -I'm-I'm... I'm not one to make a fuss, but where I come from, shopgirls are pleased to be of service. Shopgirls? This lady wishes to buy a dress. Direct her to a suitable shop. Go. Uh, please let me escort you out. No, no, no, no, no, hang on a minute. I've come miles. Saved every penny scrubbing floors and I don't know what so I can buy this frock. A Christian Dior gown is not for pennies. Right. If you think I ain't got the money... there. Oh là l. Are you Mr. Dior? Oh, oh, no, I'm Mr. Fauvel, accounts. Let me help you with the... Excuse me, chère madame, but it would be my honor to have you view the collection as my guest. There you are. Merci. Shall we? Oh. It's here. Thank you. When you see the dress you want, you can write the number down here. Oh. Oh, I was just admiring your buttonhole. Oh. - It's Louise Odier. - Ah? Yes, it's lovely. Proper scent. Are you a connoisseur of roses? My husband Eddie worked at Covent Garden, the flower market. He was always bringing home odds and ends, you know. Roses are me favorite. You after a dress for your wife? Ooh. Lucky woman. My wife is dead. Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir. My clumsy clogs. My Eddie and all. Oh, um... But yes, uh, my wife and I would come here together. I like to see beautiful clothes. And beautiful women, of course. Oh, here we go. Ooh. Oh, that's lovely. Oh. Oh, will you look. Oh, that's lovely. Vénus. - What number's that? - 73. - Vénus. Yes. - 73. Vénus. - What number's that? - 89. Temptation. Oh, yeah. Bravo! Who's that bloke? Well, that's the master himself, Monsieur Dior. Go on. He looks like my milkman. Well, good luck, madame. I hope you find what you're looking for. Oh, well... Here. You do not wish to keep it? Yeah, it's-it's lovely. Thank you. Enchanté. Don't mind me. - Yes, madame? - Oh. Have you made your selection? Yes. Um... Number 89, please. Temptation. Of course. - Your name, please. - Harris. Mrs. Ada Harris. My apologies, madame. - Excusez-moi. - Oh, yeah. - Ah. - Oh. Ta-da. Madame Harris, I regret... Well, there is a difficulty with Temptation. It seems Madame Avallon demands it. How's that work, then? You only got the one dress? I'm sorry. Madame insists on exclusivity. Madame Avallon is one of our most devoted clients. And her husband is known as "The King of Rubbish." But we would be so sorry if you were to leave Maison Dior without a purchase. And you also wrote number 73 on your card. - Oh. - Vénus. Yeah, I never thought nothing could be more beautiful. Not till I saw Temptation. An excellent choice, madame. Yeah. How much is it? Vénus is 600,000 francs. 430 pounds. Wrap it up. I got a plane to catch. I'm a day late as it is. Oh, you cannot have this gown. Oh, don't tell me someone wants that exclusive and all. Mais Madame Harris, every dress is made and fitted individually for the client. Yes, this is haute couture. We will, of course, reproduce Vénus exactly as you saw it, but the thing is... Make me one? How long's that gonna take? Well, at least two weeks. Ooh. At least. Several fittings are necessary. What, leave my people for a fortnight? They'd find someone else, and then I'd be out on the streets. Vite, vite, to the airport, then. I would not forgive myself if you missed your flight. - What, without my dress? - Excusez-moi. Perhaps there is a friend you can call? Someone who can assist you with your cleaning. Well, uh, there's Vi, but I've tried her patience enough as it is. Anyway, she's not on the phone. Uh, we might send her a telegram. Uh, Mrs. Harris, uh, it might be possible to encourage the cutter and seamstress to work a little faster. And Madame Vi could fill you in for one week, perhaps? Well... you're kind, but I can't. Anyway, I got nowhere to stay. I'll have to give it a miss.
