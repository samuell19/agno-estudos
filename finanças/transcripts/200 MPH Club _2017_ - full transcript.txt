We at LAX, hope you have an exceptional experience. People always ask, "What does it feel like "to go 260 mph?" Well, on these salt flats, there's no point of reference in your peripheral vision. You know what it's like driving down the freeway when there's phone poles, or a guard rail or trees and they're whizzing by, you don't have that here. You really only know intellectually, that you're going that fast. And you've got just the buzz inside the car, and the heat, and the noise, and you know what's going on. You know you're going more than 200 mph. But it doesn't feel like that. It's sort of like driving on the moon. If I get the 200 mph club done here in Australia, I will have five entries in 200 mph clubs. There aren't a whole lot of people who have done that. It's less than ten, it might be less than five. And if Keith gets it done down here then he will be in seven 200 mph clubs, and I don't think any body else has done that. So a right-hand turn, left-hand lane. Yeah. Meaning over there, by that... You're good. We were looking the wrong way again. Looking the wrong way, yeah. Dammit. Course we have to look over there too. I want to say that's where I was looking. That's not where I was looking. I was looking right down this lane. Yeah, I'm looking down there. Am I good over there? You are. Stay in your lane. All right now we're good, we're golden. Now we're just straight. We're on A1 again so we'll just stay on here until our feet get tired. One of the things David and I have done for each other is we've kind of balanced each other's highs and lows. David is really really good at planning and thoughts, he loves going through the record book and trying to figure out where our skills meet the record book. I bring to the table the ability to get it done. To take all of that thoughts and theories and put it all together. Between the two of us, we've been fairly successful. But more importantly than being successful, we've helped each other both accomplish our goals. I really wanted to come here because I felt I had unfinished business. The first time, was I think 2008, we shipped our Bonneville race car here to try to run it at the salt flats in Australia. And when we got here, the salt was wet, and they wouldn't let us run, so we packed it up and shipped it home. We're going to Lake Gairdner, which is the fourth biggest salt flats in Australia. And it's way bigger than Bonneville, but it's just like the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States, which is normally where I like to do my land speed racing. There's some stress racing here, because it's so far out in the middle of nowhere. And let's be honest, when you're going as quick as maybe 240 mph in these cars, things can go wrong, and you can get hurt pretty badly. And we're a long way from medical care. There's only a few dry lakes in the world that actually have the ability to be raced on. We're out here in the middle... We're 300 miles into the Outback in Australia. We are truly desolate. Australians live around the outside of Australia. Nobody lives in the middle of it. We, right now, are in the middle of it. We're not going to win anything here, we're not going to make any money, there is no prize money. When we're all said and done, we're going to get a freaking hat. It's the most important thing in the world to me. I've been chasing this hat for what? This is my fourth time here. I've been chasing these hats for years and years, I've got all these hats wrapped up on my counter, and I don't even wear hats. I'm looking forward to feeling the salt underneath us. Feels like Bonneville right now. It's always kind of a cool feeling isn't it? The first time you roll in and everything's just perfectly smooth. I have always kind of had a fascination with land speed racing. Many years ago a friend of mine was hurt very badly and it made me realize I could either continue this fascination, or I could actually do something about it. So I got up off the couch and bought a race car, took it home, started racing it. It's literally that simple. I don't know how to put that any better. Who am I? I'm just a guy that likes cars. I was the editor of Hot Rod Magazine for more than 12 years. And I look at land speed racing as the very very origins of everything that hot rodding is. All the way back into the early 30s, when hot rodders down in central LA, were first knocking the fenders and running boards off of their Model As and Model Ts, and driving them on Podunk little roads all the way up to the Dry Lakes in southern California. I almost feel like I owe it to the heritage of what they started for us and this entire industry, to keep this going, to keep writing about it, to keep racing it, and feeling like I'm kind of brethren with them, by actually doing it. We made it. The records that we're running on here are all open records meaning that any pass that we make in excess of 200 mph will be a record and will get us in the 200 mph club here. This is the one opportunity in amateur racing where a guy from the middle of nowhere can literally come up with a national record, and sometimes an international record. This is an amateur event. It's about the guy getting off the couch and going racing. It's about the little guy. I'm from Brisbane, Queensland, just north of the Gold Coast. My name is Fleabag. Some people, it's all about going fast, I really don't care. I just enjoy building the car. If it broke I had no way in the world of means of paying my way out of it or repairing it or anything. I just cross my fingers and hope it all worked out. The car we're going to drive here is the 1968 Chevy Camaro. It's aerodynamically bone stock but it has a 500 cubic inch engine and it makes about a thousand horse power. It belongs to a guy named Jack Rogers who Keith and I know from Bonneville. And he sent three of his cars down here in this semi truck which means Keith and I are probably going to be checking over the car really well. Also because I've never even seen this thing before. Ouch. Dude I'll tell you what, that frickin' hurt. Do you have ice? I burned the piss out of myself. Oh really? Yeah that just burned the hell out of me. Wow, the foam stuck to you? The foam stuck to me and then my hand's on fire. Oh wow. But just the pain of that, tells you why to wear every bit of fire suit you can wear. Yeah the pain of this makes you realize how bad that would be if you actually burned yourself. Meanwhile, I'm hungry. Well, what are we eating? I dunno. My hand? Keith Turk and David Freiburger are both giving a lot to the sport that we all enjoy. And I knew of the fact that they came to Australia a couple of times and were unsuccessful because of the refrain of getting on the track. So I called Keith and said "Look, we're coming over here "if you two guys would like to join us, "we'd be honored to give you the opportunity "to do what you tried to do several years ago." It was a great opportunity to give some payback to these guys that do so much for the hot rodding sport. You see so many unique approaches to the same problem of speed. It's not a cookie cutter deal like you see at NASCAR or some of the other racing venues that are so professional and rule-backed. You get a small set of rules, and other than that, you're unlimited. I am Animal. My title is race director. I've been doing that unofficially since 1996. That means that anything goes down, I'm the boss. I have been known to burn a couple of flags over the years which I'm not really proud of, but I've never burned an American flag. Because I am a patriot of speed. Over the years, I have seen from 50CC bikes, to the world's fastest tractor engine. If it's here to go fast, I'm here to watch. As long as we all do it safely, and that's the basis of everything. Do everything safely, and everybody's happy. The president of the Dry Lakes races, Norman Bradshaw, has told me "No more underpants. "You are not to wear your underpants out on the lake at all!" I turned around and said why does he want to see me nude? No matter how many times you do this, there's still the anxiety of sitting there, hoping that you won't do something stupid. Or something that you should have remembered, but that you forgot about. Please God, don't let me screw up. I don't want to hurt your car, I don't want to hurt your motor I just want to be calm, safe, smooth, and controlled. Calm, safe, smooth, and controlled. And just, you know? The routine that we have that I don't know if I can do this racing without, is the strapping in procedure. That whole thing. I would feel uncomfortable doing that with someone other than you. I've only ever done it with you. You know, there's nothing quite like that feeling of knowing you've hammered it. To me, you pull the chute, and as soon as you feel it hit... It's like holy crap. Yeah I don't think there's anything that I've done that you've got this great thrill of racing down the track but then when you feel that chute hit you in the back, that's sweet. Yeah. But to me, actually, the best moment on the salt, is when you've pulled off, you're sitting there out of the car, no one's around, your crew hasn't shown up yet, it's completely quiet, and you know that you've just pulled it off. And it's just you and the salt. So tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow... That tomorrow, come what may. The biggest thing about land speed racing is that it's all about personal achievement. There's no money in it, whatsoever. It's about setting a personal goal, and making it happen, and it's really all about the respect of your peers, which is the other racers. Keith is going to go race the car first. And he's got to run 200 mph in the first three miles. And if he does, I'm going to hop in and try it myself. And the thing is, neither one of us have ever driven this car before. David and I have been kind of chasing two clubs as a personal goal for a number of years. We've known each other for a couple years more than we've been racing. But more importantly, all Bonneville racing traditionally has been a team type sport. There's so many pieces to the puzzle, and trying to put them all together for one person is pretty tough. All of David's 200 mph clubs, we've gotten together. Most of mine we have gotten together. This isn't about the cars, this isn't about the mechanics, this is about David and I getting in the two club. Here we go! You ready for this? Yeah. All right, let's do this. Is the CB turned up? Yeah. And he said he was going to roll through at 205. 237, bam! Got that done. We needed that. Excellent. How about that, old man? Two three seven! Lake Gairnder, Australia, how about that? Seven 200 mph clubs. I'll be damned. I am thrilled for Keith, that was awesome. He was saying the whole time that he was going to run 205 or 210. But obviously once you get in the car and the adrenaline's up and you feel like you've got it under control, he said he was just ignoring the tack and keeping it down until he went through the three mile. ECTA, Mirror Rock, Bonneville, El Mirage, Loring Maine, Texas, Lake Gairdner, Australia. See the rain over there? We're thinking a lot about putting me out there right now. There's a lot of rain coming in. The weather out on the salt flats is so unpredictable that the rain can come in and flood the whole place. If it dumps enough water on the track, they could cancel this run, they could even cancel the entire meet. And I'd go home again with no record. Straighten these shorts out. How's it going? All right, we need to get him in the car. Ah, what else can go wrong? I know it. This is ridiculous. Jamming to get up here before the rain, and what happens? The rain starts right as we get to the line. They might be calling it for the night. They might be calling it for the week, depending on how bad it hits. There's a lot of rain coming in. Wet. It's just kind of getting slick. So it kind of gets mushy and slidy, so. It's 4:20 right now, I suspect we're probably done for the day. I think that's probably it. I doubt we'll get to race. So yeah, they called it, done for the day. The hope is that the wind will come up tonight and dry this stuff out, and some sun in the morning, and then hopefully we can run it in some decent conditions. There's a salt berm down on the right-hand side. And if you hit that at speed, it could be dangerous. Right, lets go have fun. So we had a quick driver's meeting up there. Obviously the salt completely dried out last night, there was a big wind, and arguably, it's better than it was yesterday as a result of being wet and then drying out like that. And the other good news, is that because we were right at the front of the line last night, they're going to shove us up front, right now. So we should get a first pass on good salt. Parachute, parachute, parachute. Parachute, parachute, parachute. Fuel, fire, ignition. Parachute, fuel, fire, ignition. Parachute, fuel, fire. Parachute. Firebottle pins out? Firebottle pins are out. Parachute pins out. One of the things that Keith always says to me, because we have a routine where we strap each other in the car, and Keith will always strap me in, and the last thing that he says before he slams the door is always "This run isn't that important." Meaning that even though you're about to get in the 200 mph club, or even though you're about to set a record, there's nothing more important than keeping yourself safe in the car. Remember this is all going to happen pretty fast, so. Dude, I'm just going straight and giving best, you are getting tight. This is coming tight. Now I'm going to get on you all right? Don't we have a few more to go? Nope, you're it. All right bud, that's it. All right. Are you in? I'm in. Pretty tight? Okay. This pass is not that important, remember that. Okay, slow and steady. Arrivederci, David! Nobody has value unless they have passion. This whole thing because I had dreamed about it for so long, and all the passion involved, the guy that that was focused on was a guy named John Becket who started this little racing organization. And in 2005, he tumbled and he lost his life. It's a... We got a CB to listen? We were going to race next, that's what was next. And David was in the car, and I had to figure out what to tell him. Though I had very strong suspicions that he had died at that point. If you think of what Keith had to go through at that moment, he's sitting there really broken up, having to deal with a lot of emotions while strapping me into his car, another one of his good friends, and having to send him down the same salt, that just took the life of another friend of his. I think we backed up the record, we finished our week. But when I got home, I wrote this editorial column about the conversation I had with Keith about that. I said "Why do we do this? "It's not that important. "Why are we risking our lives on it?" And he said "Well because it is important, "and even if we're looking at record books, "and they don't mean anything to the guy "on the street corner, but they mean a lot to us, "that's the point. "Is that it means a lot to us." And so I called this editorial column The Importance of Risk. What was it, 249? 249. Holy shit. You have no idea how relieved I am. I was one a... I retired as a helicopter pilot, in 1996. And my biggest fear when I retired was that I would go to work and teach kids to fly helicopters, and one day wake up, be 65 years old, and never have accomplished a thing in my life. And I know this sounds corny, okay, so this puts me in seven 200 mph clubs, and that's really, really great. But the reality is this puts David in five 200 mph clubs. And getting five is a big deal. It also kind of seals our history as racers, you know? It shows our stick-to-itiveness, you know, and our tenacity. I think it's got value. It's who we are, it's how we breathe, it's how we eat. It's what we do. It's what makes our life have value. Thank you very much! All right, now I want to see. My quarter speed is lame. The three mile 232... Is lame. Four mile 249.5! Whoa! Look, come down one more. 249.5. Get over it, get over it. 249.5 is not 250, that's the problem. 249 dude, that is a huge number. All I need was a little bit more stank and the thing would have been.
