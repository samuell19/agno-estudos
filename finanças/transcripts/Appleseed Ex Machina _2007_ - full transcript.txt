In the year 2133... ...the world was plunged into an era of devastation and chaos. More than half the Earth's population was killed off by nonnuclear global war. It was only a matter of time before the planet itself... ...would become utterly uninhabitable and all life there would cease to exist. Human beings searched for their last seed of hope. And when they could not find one, they created one Olympus. In this new utopia... ...those injured in the war were reconditioned as human cyborgs. International disputes would be buffered... ...by a breed of genetically engineered humans called bioroids... ...designed never to feel such emotions as anger and hatred. To further ensure peace, Olympus also created E.S.W.A.T... ...an elite force with worldwide jurisdiction. Yet with all gardens... ...this Eden was still susceptible to serpents, who seek its destruction. All right gang, listen up. We got a heavily armed group holed up in an abandoned church... ...with top-ranking EU officials as hostages. Don't know who they are or what they want. Local police haven't taken them down, so you know the drill. You could be looking at combat cyborgs. We move in at 22:45 sharp. Synchronize your watches to 22:30 on my mark. Three... ...two... ...one... ...mark. A high-tech cyborg wearing an analog watch. Well, look at that. Has its own heartbeat, just like l do. Yeah, well, the sound of it will get your ass shot. Tell him, Deunan. He's your partner. Well, l'll be. You two are made for each other. Approaching landing zone. Drop point confirmed. Drop point clear. All units, deploy. Go ! Go ! l'm outside the corridor and l'm going in. Launch assault in 30 seconds. All units, stand by. Flash grenade inside the cathedral. Damn you, Deunan. All right, prepare to move in ! On my count. Three, two, one. Cover me ! Fire ! Secure the hostage ! You all right ? Watch the hostage. -Got it. They're all cyborgs. What the hell's going on ? Let's ask them. l think they're in the mood to talk now. Who are you ? What do you want ? Do you hear me ? Answer me ! All will be one. We will all be one. l am Halcon. He's gonna blow. Move it ! Deunan, are you all right ? Briareos. Briareos ! Don't... Deunan, stop. -Let go. Let go of me, goddamn it ! Briareos. Briareos ! Attention, all units. We have a disturbance reported in Sector B-47... ...involving a construction Landmate. Request E.S.W.A.T. dispatch. Team 2, proceed to WASP hangar in Delta Formation at once. Repeat, disturbance in Sector B-47. Request E.S.W.A.T. dispatch. Team 2, report to the WASP hangar in Delta Formation at once. Captain. Deunan ? -l heard the call. l'm already near B-47 right now. Aren't you supposed to be off-duty, today ? Yeah. Things change. We're on our way. Don't do anything stupid, Deunan. You hear me ? Run ! Run ! What's happening ? -He got fired. Next thing you know, he grabbed a Landmate. He's going to turn the place. Oh, God ! Get up ! Where's the kill switch ? -On his back. Unit 1 ready. Don't treat me like a fool ! Goddamn you ! Goddamn you ! l swear to God l'll kill you ! You're late. Got it. l saw it. Come here, you little shit ! Damn it ! Get off of me ! Damn it ! Get off ! Shit ! Get off ! You little bitch ! Get off ! l can't move. Aaah ! What are you doing ?! Let me out of here ! You bitch ! Looks like we missed the party. l told you to play it cool. Didn't l ? Don't yell at me, he started it. Who's the new guy ? Oh, yeah, right. l have to introduce you. Some other time, Lance. Today is my day off. Deunan Knute, meet Tereus. Your new partner. What the hell are you thinking, Nike ?! Watch your mouth, Deunan. Oh, l'm sorry, but did you forget that my partner is in the hospital ? l can't believe that you'd do this to me. -Well, believe it. Tereus is the only one whose fighting potential compares to Briareos. That's not what l'm talking about and you know it ! Why does your new partner looks remarkably similar to Briareos... ...before he became a cyborg ? lsn't that what you want to know ? Yeah. Come with me, Deunan. At first glance, you might not notice anything different here. This facility is, for the most part, just like its predecessor. We continue to create bioroids from the very same DNA as you humans... ...genetically deleting negative emotions. As you know, bioroids are, more often than not, diplomats, emissaries... ...and, like your friend Hitomi, ministers of political affairs. But is this application limited ? We believe it is. So we decided to produce bioroids with high combat capabilities... ...to further uphold public order. Tereus is serving as our prototype. He fights to preserve law and order. And unlike humans, anger and hatred will never influence his decision to fight. The majority of his genetic code was taken from Briareos. And you expected me to be fine with that. After analyzing combat data from all soldiers in E.S.W.A.T... ...we found him to be by far the most qualified of all candidates. And then there is his Hecatonchire-class body. Briareos is the only person in existence who has ever adapted to it. His physical and mental strength are truly remarkable. You were his former partner. That's why we need you to assess Tereus' capabilities. Am l quite clear ? Crystal. But l won't do it. Well, it's not really your decision. You bitch. Deunan. -Hitomi, you're back. l just got back from the World Trade Expo. l heard, about Briareos. Yes ? -Deunan, it's Lance. Briareos is waking up. l'll be right there. As the prime minister of Olympus... ...I strongly advocate a global security network. This would entail bringing all the world's surveillance... ...as well as communication satellites under the control of Olympus. This will enhance our capacity to monitor and prevent synchronized terrorist acts. This issue will be our highest priority next month... ...at the Olympus International Peace Summit. Hey, how about dinner tonight ? Hey, what..? What are those things ? Hm ? l swear, you are always behind the times, aren't you, Deunan ? l know, l know. Here. Check it out. lt's called a Connexus. lt's the most advanced personal multimedia terminal ever made. Makes my life so much easier. Here, try it on. They are so hot right now. Everybody's got one. lt's an amazing piece of technology. And anyone can use it just by accessing the free open-source codes. That's the best thing about it. Hey, go ahead and open that message on the right. What is it ? A birthday party ? Promise me you'll come, okay ? -Of course. So, how old are you gonna be ? Look, just because l'm a bioroid, l am not gonna tell you my age. Briareos ! Hold it right there, honey. You have to be gentle, all right ? After all, they just put him back together. We can't have you breaking him all up again. Get in there. We should be able to release him in just over a week. Are you serious ? -He's a lucky man. Dr. Kestner's the chief professor at the academy... ...not to mention the foremost expert on cyborg medical science. Your buddy's in good hands. Hell, he's even my doctor. Sheesh. You're being too kind, l'm afraid. l'll leave you all to your visit. So, what's new ? lt's just like we thought it was. The investigation at the church revealed all the terrorists were cyborgs. We've taken another look at the five most recent terror incidents. Four were carried out entirely by cyborgs. Cyborg terrorists ? What are they after ? That's what l'd like to know. But we do have a couple of leads to go on. We've found unidentified frequencies, all of them in the surrounding areas. Pattern looks like a puppet-master program from the war. They're being brainwashed. lt's a possibility. The problem is there's a whole bunch of cyborgs out there... ...with poorly protected systems, unlike us. But if someone is manipulating civilian cyborgs for terrorist acts... Things are gonna get a lot hotter on our end. What's worse, we have no idea who we're dealing with or what they want. So get off your ass, we need you. -What are you talking about ? l can't go on active duty like this. Well, don`t we can all these wires come off ? Don't pull. You're not my doctor. -Come on tell me ! Let go of that. Don't look at me, l was trying to stop her. Here, l fixed it for you. This thing's tougher than l am. You heard about the new guy, Tereus, right ? Yeah. Before you came. Well, l don't care what they say. You're my partner, no matter what happens. Deunan, get back ! Deunan, talk to me. Are you all right ?! -Briareos. Am l... ? Am l alive ? Yeah, you're alive. Thank you. l'll always protect you, even if the world comes to an end. l know you will. l am Yoshino from Poseidon. And l am Nike, the chief of staff of Olympus. Prime Minister Athena has been expecting you. As you can see, many of the cyborgs involved in the terrorist incidents... ...were equipped with components made by Poseidon. l would like to know... ...what are your thoughts on the matter, Emissary Yoshino ? We have tracked down the cyborg parts in question... ...to the lab that manufactured them, and shut it down immediately. Other departments have enacted countermeasures as well. However, it would be regrettable to draw connections... ...between these criminals and Poseidon. So then, you're saying Poseidon had nothing to do with the latest terrorist attacks ? Prime minister, you're well aware... ...that Poseidon is the largest industrial conglomerate in the world. Our profits come from trade with other countries. Siding with terrorists would give no financial benefits whatsoever. lf Olympus were to boycott our products, other countries would follow your lead. Clearly, the negative impact on business would not be in our best interest. That may be, but we have issued the same message... ...to all the businesses that may have been involved. We cannot afford to give Poseidon special consideration. lsn't one of the topics at the peace conference your desire to enhance surveillance by controlling international satellite systems ? ls it not ? This hyper-sheath contains the master control program to our satellite network. Consider it a gift. Cutting a deal, are we ? -Our contribution to global welfare. Not something l'd expect to hear from a business that makes tools for war. lf l may ask, what is your military's true purpose ? Don't you believe you can protect the world without force ? l'm sorry, but we'll discuss such matters another time. Then we will look forward to your favorable reply. You know her ? -Yeah, known her for about 10 years now. Great. Keep them coming. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Thank you so much. Thank you. lt was so sweet of you all to come tonight. l hope all of you have a great time. You look great. Happy birthday. Yoshitsune, it's beautiful. Hey, who's that ? Looks like you've got a surprise guest hiding over there. Come on, get over here. Come on ! Well, take a look at Deunan Knute. -Well, you clean up nice. Well... Yeah. Okay, enough already. Here you go. I hope you like it. -Thank you. Happy birthday Hitomi. -Thank you. Have a good time. We have good things in store for you tonight too. Hm ? -Just look over there. What ? Briareos. Does this mean you're okay ? -Yeah. They say l've checked out just fine. But l might need to have them look at my eyescope. Oh, stop it. Tonight we're also celebrating Briareos' full recovery. l had no idea. Happy birthday, Hitomi. How lovely. Thank you so much. Oh, yeah. You two still haven't met yet, have you ? Briareos, meet Tereus. Well, Briareos at last. lt's nice to meet you. ls this supposed to be a costume party ? This guy's wearing a mask with my old face. To be honest, it wasn't exactly my own choice. Sounds a little like me too. So, l have my old partner back now. l meant to talk to you about that. Afraid, l need you to stick with Tereus a little longer. lt's okay, Deunan. l'll team up with Aeacos for a while. -What do you mean ? l saw your combat data with him. Not bad. Wait, is this some kind of joke ? Because l'm not laughing ! Think about it, Deunan. They fixed me twice. Who are you gonna partner with... ...if they can't do it a third time ? -Then l won't partner with anyone ! Deunan ?! Seems Briareos was pretty worried about you. Do l look like l care ? And so what if he is, anyway ? Another one ! -Better make that a coffee ! Espresso. With a shot of liqueur ! Look, Deunan, l know you're not too fond of me, but... ...but l gotta admit that l'm really glad they chose you as my partner. All l ask is that you stick with me a little longer. What's the matter ? Did Briareos tell you how l like to drink it ? No. Go home. l'll take you. Leave me alone. l get confused. l get confused when l'm with you. So do l. Phew ! The Hecatonchires were giants with a hundred arms, right ? That's mythology, but now it's a system that can control multiple external networks. And you are the only one, the only man they could find... ...who was able to adapt to the H-class machine body. Yeah, yeah. Lucky me. lt sure sucks, don't it, being a cyborg and all ? lt has its drawbacks. So, what you gonna do, pretty boy ? With Deunan, l mean. Not too many girls out there who will stay with you... ...once you're more of a machine than a man. lt hasn't crossed my mind. Nobody ever said love was easy, pal. What about you ? You got a girl ? Huh ? She making you wear jewelry ? Oh, you mean this. No, it's just my Connexus. My daughter gave it to me. She's got one to match it. What, your being a cyborg isn't enough metal on you already ? Once you start you can't stop. You're an addict. -Hey, don't break the merchandise. All cyborgs have been cleared from the premises, sir. Continuing security checks. Deunan, time to go. Right. -What's wrong ? About the other night, l... Sorry. -Ah, don't worry about it. You and l are gonna be partners, aren't we ? No matter what happens between us. l got you. And l got you. You'll have to be faster than that. This worldwide peace summit and conference of dignitaries... ...may very well forge our future. Never before have so many people.... Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open discussions to the floor. Prime Minister Athena is in. We are green. Okay. All units, look alive. Here we go. Looks like it's starting. All right. Let's hope nothing happens. Don't sweat it, partner. lf the shit hits the fan, E.S.W.A.T. will handle it. Hell, that's why they pay us the big bucks, isn't it ? And by merging each country's satellite systems... ...we will create a unified global communications network. Ladies and gentlemen, we believe this will quell conflicts... ...and terrorist attacks before they ever happen... ...helping ensure peace for future generations. Obviously, this was simply an overview of the proposed global security network. For the good of mankind, l urge you all... ...to place your countries' satellites under Olympus' control. The recent terror incident that occurred in our country... ...was handled by the Olympus E.S.W.A.T. in a very expeditious manner. A truly secure network, as you propose, would require full cooperation of every... My country already has the means to protect itself from terrorism... ...without having to rely on Olympus' support. Or perhaps your country might have things you don't want anyone else to see. What do you mean ? Would you care to elaborate on that ? Our sources indicate that your country supports several regional conflicts... That's ridiculous ! How dare you make such an undoubted accusation. Enough of this. Why should Olympus be in control of the satellite systems ? How do we know bioroids can be trusted ? -l agree. This discussion has nothing to do with race. Captain, l'm detecting an unidentified data frequency. From where ? -Multiple signals. They're everywhere. All units, be on the alert. Landmate units, prepare to move out. Code 3. All right, Aeacos. Let's move. You go on ahead. Just give me a minute, buddy. l'll be right behind you. You all right ? l'll be okay. -Okay. All right, you can go. Next. Hey. Stop. Stop ! l said stop ! Stop ! -lt's not stopping. We're gonna have to take him out ! Fire ! Fire ! Disturbance reported at Gate E-12. Okay Aeacos. l'm heading out. This is Tartaros, Front Gate, A-2. Unauthorized vehicles have breached the outer perimeter. This is Gate F-7. Our position is also being overrun. Copy that. Keep the premises secure at all costs. Order the Landmates to start mobilizing now. Deunan, Tereus, I need you to back up the police in the area. Keep the assailants away from the conference hall. Yes, sir. Minister, areas around the conference hall are under attack. Suspend proceedings and ensure your safety. Nonsense. We will continue. Unauthorized Landmate. Fire ! lt's a construction Landmate. lt's not a cyborg. What's going on here ? lt's just... lt's a man. Deunan. You okay ? Yeah. What the hell is going on here ? Those aren't cyborgs. They're humans. You still here ? Better get down there, sounds like all hell's breaking loose. What ? What's going on ? All will be one. We will all be one. l am Halcon. No. What was that ? ls it a terrorist ? We must get out of here ! lt's an explosion. Look ! We stop this meeting immediately ! -We should evacuate ! Quiet, please ! Everyone stay calm ! There is no need to panic ! This conference hall is heavily fortified and you are all safe ! Gentlemen, please return to your seats. Let us resume the discussion. Aeacos ! What's wrong ? Answer me ! Aeacos ! Everyone get back ! Let's get out of here ! Prime minister, we are leaving ! Take a good look ! This is the reality of the world we now live in ! You all must decide on this proposal right now ! Or do you want to create more unnecessary casualties ?! Stop ! Aeacos ! Briareos ! All will be one. Do you understand ? Stop it ! Aeacos ! Aeacos, no ! Aeacos. Briareos. Briareos, l.... What happened ? This thing's a robot. The frequency's coming from the doves. Looks like the Tartaros Conference Hall is stabilized and under control. Hm ? Signal's gone. Hey. What's happening to them ? The attackers at each of the gates have been suppressed. Several casualties have already been reported. The unidentified data frequency seems to have vanished. The Lord has called our brother Aeacos home. Let us pray for his soul. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May the Lord lead him unto heaven and grant him - eternal rest. Am l losing it ? Before he died - the things l saw lmpossible. Maybe l've already lost it. You worry too much. Everyone knows that you did what you had to do. Salute. Everything appears to be working just fine. Your flesh has melted with the matrix of the Hecatonchire system so perfectly... ...you're practically a work of art. Have faith. lf this technology doesn't work, no cyborg is safe from this chaos. l know what happened to Aeacos came as a terrible shock... ...but something like that could never happen to you. l see. Thanks, Doc. Briareos ? Do you like this city ? Do you believe Olympus truly is a utopia that's worthy of risking your life ? l don't know. But what l do know is that as long as there's someone in this city l care about... ...l intend to protect it. Sacrifice and love, huh ? ln all my years, l have found those ideals led only to human anguish. Wouldn't you agree ? No, l don't. Not always. Oooh, but it does. Although the peace conference... ...was temporarily disrupted by an organized attack... ...discussions ended successfully with regard to its primary topic... ...allowing world leaders to move one step closer towards unifying satellite systems. As a result of our debate at the Olympus Assembly... ...we will resume normal trade with Poseidon... ...with one notable exception. Certain cyborg parts. Thank you, prime minister, for your consideration. l'll let our headquarters know immediately. We've received the latest report on the attack at Tartaros Conference Hall. There's something that concerns me. -What is it ? According to this, one of the rioters was reported to have said, ''l am Halcon.'' What ? That's impossible. l... Halcon is nothing more than a memory. There's no way they could be involved. lD verified. Thank you. Need a partner ? l have a partner. Just not the one you used to have. Whooa. Not bad there, kid. Not bad for a copy ! Anything happens to her, l hold you responsible. Can't believe he just kicked his ass like that. We've determined the unidentified data frequency... ...detected during the incident were being transmitted by the robotic doves. We believe they were responsible. They transmitted a virus program to the cyborgs, triggering the uprising. What we don't know... ...is how regular non-cyborg humans were involved in the attack as well. But the investigation is still under way and we should know more soon. Right now, evidence suggests cyborg terrorists were behind this attack. Whether or not Aeacos was collaborating with the terrorists remains to be seen. At the same time, we can't ignore the possibility... ...that E.S.W.A.T.'s virus-protection programs for cyborgs... ...may have been compromised. So effective immediately, we will suspend participation of cyborg troops. What ? -This is bullshit. Non-cyborgs were involved as well. -You treat us like criminals for this. As long as the enemy's objectives remain unclear, we have no choice. That is all. Dismissed ! Man, forget this. l'm out of here. l don't need this crap. l'm with you. Yoshitsune ! Yeah ? Would you run some tests on this ? Some sort of biochip ? Where did you get this from ? Off one of the rioters. Just check it out for me, will you ? No problem. l'll check it out. -Thanks a lot. Tereus ! Let's have a drink. No, thanks, l'm busy. All the backup always follows the point man. You heard the lady. Centralized management of each country's satellites... ...along with the proposed system of information sharing... ...could be a first step towards fulfilling the wishes of those who long for peace... ...in our postwar society. So, where do we go ? Feel like a pub or sports bar ? Sports bar. -Sports bar. Pub. That's what l meant to say... -Pub. That's what l meant to say... We go now live to a message from Prime Minister Athena. Momentarily, we will demonstrate... ...what can happen when the satellites of 32 nations come together... ...to form a willing alliance. According to Greek mythology... ...the olive tree is a symbol of peace and prosperity. It is my belief that mankind's desire for peace... ...will soon unite our world. lt's like a carnival. -Yeah. Looks like fun. Look out ! Briareos ! Nobody strikes to me. What's happening to him, Deunan ? -l don't know. He wants that terminal. Why ? Stop it. What's gotten into you ?! What's wrong with you ?! Look out ! Tereus ! What's happening to you ?! Briareos, stop it ! l said, stop, Briareos ! What are you doing ?! Briaaareeeooos ! Damn. -Error in satellite monitoring system. Electrical supply system malfunction as well ! What the hell ? We're being hacked into from the outside. Code yellow ! Go to subsystem B, just to be safe. Copy that. Switching to B. Back online, now. The unidentified data frequency wasn't detected in that area. So they ruled that out as the cause. l think they wanna conduct drug tests and a psych exam on him. So, where is he now ? He's here, in the isolation ward. Did you see him ? He didn't want me to, so no. l see. l can do that. -Of course. l'll go on my rounds and be right back. Turn around. Okay. Be gentle. This birthmark. Briareos had the same one. What's happening to him, Tereus ? l feel like l can't help him. That biochip you wanted me to check out ? Part of a Connexus. Take a look at this. l put a Connexus on this lab rat. Now, watch what happens when l transmit the same frequency... ...from one of the robotic doves to this rat. lt's like he has no control. And now he can be controlled. When activated, the Connexus emits a signal that stimulates nerve tissue. ln other words, it can potentially be used... ...to manipulate both humans and cyborgs at will. That would explain why non-cyborgs were involved in the attack. Exactly. So, that means Aeacos was innocent, then. Just being used like the people in the riots were. This thing that's happening isn't just some kind of cyborg virus. This is something much bigger. Then the terrorist attack on Tartaros was just some kind of test. l don't know how, but we gotta get these things off the street. ls it true ? Did l really attack Deunan ? Mm-hm. What's happening to me ?! What ?! They don't know, and that's why she's worried. She wants to see you. No. Not now. Maybe there's something l can do. Richard Kestner. He's been with the Olympus Science Academy since 2135... ...but, it looks like he worked for Poseidon before that. Poseidon. Keep going. What else does it say ? Let me try to access Olympus' host computer. Okay, l'm in Gaia. Chief Technician of New Technology Elizabeth Xander. Halcon Laboratory. Halcon ? -Yeah. Give me a sec. ''No data sele...'' lt's been erased. ls Kestner behind this ? That's impossible. Somwone like Kestner never would have been able to remove that amount of data... ...from a global network on his own. Someone else must be behind this. Kestner. Poseidon. Hitomi, cover your ears. And get back. Briareos, no ! Stop it ! l need to pay the good doctor a visit ! Please, don't do this ! You could get..! l want these patients out of here ! Right now ! Doctor, Levels 4 and 6 have been cleared ! Hey. Where do you think you're going ?! We have to evacuate the hospital, immediatelly ! You get out ! l have to find someone. Go ! -You can't ! We have to leave ! Aren't you listening to me ?! Leave me aloned ! Hang on. Attention, citizens, The Connexus is now considered to be a harmful product. If you are a Connexus user... ...please turn in the device to your nearest government facility at once. Repeat, the Connexus is considered to be a harmful product. We'll be lucky if even 10 percent of the population turn them in. l want enforcement measures taken as early as tomorrow. Of course. Nike. -What is it ? Briareos has escaped from the hospital. He's taken Vice Minister Hitomi hostage. You're all aware of Briareos' capabilities. Don't you ever let your guard down. All right, move out. Deunan Knute ! l want you to withdraw from this assignment. What are you talking about ? -That's a direct order. You understand me ? Remain here on standby. Got it ? Pull your vehicle to the side of the road immediately ! Surrender or we will take hostile action ! What do we do ? -Do what they want. I repeat, stop your vehicle immediately. -Just not right away. Thanks for the lift. Do you want a gun ? -Don't need one. We've taken the hostage into protective custody. The fugitive's whereabouts are still unknown. So where is he ? Where did he go ? Are you asking me ? How would l know ? l don't care if you're the vice minister or not, you're aiding and abetting a fugitive. And that makes you just as guilty as he is. It looks like the fugitive took Harbor Way Number 4... ...and exited somewhere near Cygnus. We're currently inspecting all vehicles within a 1-kilometer radius of the area. l see that you're going for that bachelor-pad look. l can tell you live alone. Ooh, no. l am never exactly alone. What have you done to my body ? lt's impossible to control your body... ...using data frequencies from the outside. Fortunately, your little incident the other day... ...gave me the perfect opportunity to add a rather special feature... ...to that Hecatonchire body of yours at no extra charge. Nanomachiiinzz. You did what ? They're ravenous feeders, and how they feed off of you. lt's a fascinating program, really... ...activated the instant that your adrenaline levels... ...rise just beyond the certain point. You do realize that the hacking incident you caused was all part of the plan. You see, l found it would be very difficult... ...to infiltrate the main control room of the satellite command center. So l performed a little trick on their backup module. All that was needed then was to crash the main system. And you did that wonderfully. Why are you doing this ? Do you know why this world can never exist without bloodshed ? lndividual differences, of course. Different hearts, different minds. That is the essence of all conflict. But if our world was converted to a single, united consciousness.... You're the one. You're the one behind the attacks. No. l have comrades all over the world. Don't fuck with me ! Ooh, l've already done that. Now onto the others. System error. We've lost control of the satellites. All links to the satellites are cut off. What the hell is going on ?! Backup system's out too. -Try it again. What are you trying to do ? -lntegration... ...and natural selection. Those that cannot be integrated will be eliminated. Thanks to the Connexus and the global satellite network... ...mankind will be united once and for all. lmagine a world without misunderstanding or discrimination. The elimination of all human conflict and the banishment of war. My vision and Halcon's ideals will finally become our reality and truth. Halcon. The global security network is down. We've lost control of the satellites. Repeat, we've lost control of the satellites. They waited for the satellites to unite before hijacking them. Even the attack on the peace summit must have been thoroughly designed. Prime minister, if they use... lf they transmit that signal to Connexus via satellites.... Nike, issue an alert to the alliance nations. -At once. Don't worry. My friend, in but a moment you will understand. Mechanical or not, our bodies are just vessels. Oh, l'm afraid this bullet is not meant for you, my cyborg accomplice. Kestner. Don't do it ! We will all become one. What ? We've got him ! He's here ! -Stay where you are. Don't move ! Freeze ! Put your hands up ! Now ! -Do what he says ! We've found the fugitive cyborg. There's a man down. Send an ambulance. l said, don't move ! -l got him. Don't you do it ! Get him ! Take him down ! Hold it. -Freeze ! Stop him ! Shit, where'd he go ? -He jumped. He's down there. Can't believe this. We have two men down. Send a medical team to street level. We will continue pursuit. Briareos is still on the run. He's considered armed and dangerous. If he resists... ...you're authorized to use lethal force. Most recent sighting: Headed south on Cygnus Street. I repeat, Briareos is still on the run. l'll always protect you, even if the world comes to an end. l need your help. -You're gonna go after him, aren't you ? When you find him, use these. What are they ? Parasite antitoxins. They were developed during the war as a countermeasure against cyber-terrorism. lt's like shock treatment for cyborgs. lt should help him regain consciousness. lf he starts to lose it again, shoot this into his nervous system... ...from the back of his neck, if you can get it there. So, this can save him ? lt's just an emergency measure, but it's better than nothing. Thanks for doing this. l owe you one. Good luck. Briareos. l knew it. l knew you'd come here. So... ...you know every move l'm gonna make, don't you ? l'm taking you in, Briareos. Don't come any closer. What..? What's happening to me ? Don't move. Who are you ? Why is there another one of me ?! Why do you have what l've lost ?! Be one. Get out of my head ! Deunan. Briareos, no ! Tereus, hold him down ! Briareos. lt's no use, Deunan. We have to... Shut up and hold him ! Briareos, stop. Listen to me. l'm not gonna lose you. Not this way ! Briareos ! Briareos. Briareos ! Deunan ? lt's me, l'm here. l'm here. l'm always here. All right, step aside, Deunan. l have to take him in. -You what ? lt's too late. Oh, my God, this is it. l'm registering riot codes everywhere. Multiple signals. Riots are breaking out across Olympus. We've lost communication with the other countries. Unidentified data frequencies confirmed. lt's being broadcast from the satellites. Everywhere ? This is happening all over the world. lt's war. This is how the war begins. E.S.W.A.T. will work in conjunction with the police to suppress the riots. But remember, they're not terrorists, just ordinary civilians being manipulated. No excessive force unless you have to. But don't forget - these riots must be stopped. By any means necessary. Steady. Steady. Son of a bitch ! How's this happening ?! Everyone who's hooked into Connexus is being controlled... ...is that what you're telling me ? What do we do ? This way. l've got signals everywhere. -We have to destroy the source. ''Halcon,'' that's what Kestner called it. Poseidon is behind all this... ...and they're hiding something. Poseidon's ship and their emissary have already left, but they can't be too far. Let's go, we can do it. -Yeah. Tereus, come in. Have you located Briareos ? I repeat, have you located Briareos ? Report your status. This is Tereus. l'm afraid Briareos is.... He's dead, sir. l repeat, Briareos is dead. No need to send backup. And thanks to you two, l just told my first lie. All right, let's go. l mean, l... l can't go back to the station now, can l ? l guess not. Move it. They don't fly themselves. Mob numbers are in the hundreds of thousands. My readings say they're heading towards Tartaros. Hold your positions ! Avoid deadly force if at all possible ! That's it. Hold your fire. We need to see your emissary. Who are you ? What do you want ? We need to know two things. What is Halcon and where can we find it ? Halcon is no more. But once it was Poseidon's leading research-and-development lab. Professor Elizabeth Xander was the head of research. They designed and developed rehabilitation devices... ...for those who had sustained severe head trauma in the war. Using artificial intelligence and cyborg technologies... ...they saved hundreds of the wounded. Almost, like a god. Their pride led them to develop a distorted sense of reality. Did Halcon Laboratories invent the Connexus ? l don't know. What l do know is this. Mind control was their obsession. And like any obsession, it needed to be stopped. You could say it was fate. Elizabeth Xander was killed in an accident. Shortly after, we decided to put an end to Halcon. But you didn't put an end to it. You gave it new power. You gave Kestner purpose. Tried to cover it up and instead gave it new life. Look what you've done, all to protect your profits. Halcon's still alive and you know where it is. Tell me ! This is Halcon's zero-gravity plant. lt's been abandoned for years... ...but we've traced the frequency back to this location. You intercepted our vessel on our way there. Good. Then l'll finish the job you started. All l need to know is are you gonna get in my way ? Because l'm going to Halcon... ...and tear it apart piece by piece. You won't do it alone. Tereus and l are going too. Then let's move. We can supply you with the latest weapons and a small task force. Consider it a goodwill gesture. This is Arges. He will take care of the rest. We'll take you there. And l got something you'll need. A human, a bioroid and a cyborg. Only in Olympus. Good luck to all of you. You'll need it. Excellent. lf it wasn't pink, l'd be riding it. Not to be mean, but pink was never your color. Look, we're gonna stop the Halcon signal and you'll be fine, l know it. lt's worth a shot. The target should be at sight soon. All Landmates, prepare for take off. Oh, my God. That's it. lt's a hell of a lot bigger than l imagined. Halcon's main computer should be located in the center. Our unit will escort three Olympus Landmates to Halcon's central core. No idea what's gonna be inside. But that doesn't matter. We're gonna put an end to this now. Understand ? Stay cool, stay focused... ...and get ready. Now, go in there and do what you're trained to do ! lt's moving. Roll to the right ! What the hell is that ? They're drones ! Central core coming up after we get through this corridor. The size of it. That's gotta be the center of Halcon. And that's what the drones are protecting. Stay sharp ! Here they come ! Look alive. Rolling fire ! Keep it moving ! No. Not now. Briareos, no ! No ! Get back ! Briareos ! lt's me, listen. Deunan. You all right ? l'm all right. Let's keep going. Another wave coming in ! Keep it tight, people. Concentrate remaining forces on reaching the target. Tereus, l only have one dose left... ...but l know my body. l won't be able to take another shot. lf l lose it again... ...l want you to take me out. You understand ? Are you sure ? Why me ? -You know why. Yeah. lncoming ! Maintain formation. Cut straight through them. Look out ! What the hell have we got now ? Damn it. Jeez. Come on, show me what you got. Deunan, are you all right ? -Yeah ! There's another one. Over there. That one's mine. He's asking for it. -We'll distract the drones. Take him out. -Count on it. Move it, Deunan. Watch your back. -You watch yours. Oh, damn it. Where are you ? That's right, keep them coming. These guys aren't half bad. That`s the central gate closing ! l got it. Tereus, take care of Deunan. One step ahead of you. Move it ! Deunan. -Tereus. Gotcha. Tereus, hurry ! We're gonna eject, then we jump through. Do it ! l can't believe this shit is happening to me. Stay back ! Stay the hell back ! Mama. What cannot become one will be eliminated. Daddy ? Daddy, get up. Daddy. Daddy ! Daddy ! Section E commander, come in. The security cameras have been destroyed. We can't seem to contact Section S, either. All monitoring systems in Olympus have been lost. This is your captain. All E.S.W.A.T. troops, report your status. Come in ! Come in ! l can't believe this is happening. What is that ? Oh, my God. lt's Xander. Kestner, what have you done ? Good to see you again, Briareos. Briareos ! Deunan ! Go ahead and shoot. Just be aware that if you kill me... ...all of the ones who have merged with Halcon will be lost forever. That, of course, will include the Hecatonchires, as well. What are we gonna do ? How are we gonna stop this thing ? That would be impossible. Surrender yourselves now and become one with Halcon. Deunan ! Briareos. Help me. Briareos ! Oh, no. Not like this. Briareos ? -Part of Xander still lives. You have to find it. Deunan. Help, me, please. You cannot help her. You can try to plug me into whatever program you've got planned... ...but let me tell you, l won't let you do it. Hmm. Deunan... ...use this. Go. How l admire your spirit. Tereus ! Xander, you've got to listen. You're not real, you're not the same anymore. l know. You're like l am. We're just copies... ...but neither you.... Neither you nor l should be used by anybody else ! Deunan. l've reset Halcon's signals, but you'll need to hurry, Deunan. Xander, you can't let him use you anymore. Deunan, destroy me while you still can. lt's the only way to stop the Halcon system. Kill me before... ...Kestner's machine takes control of me... ...again. Deunan, shoot her ! l'm sorry. Xander. l have released. l am free. He has no hold any longer. Thank you. And l'm so, so, so... ...sorry. This is Sector J-4. The rioters have all started collapsing en masse. They've just stopped moving. The unidentified data frequency has stopped transmission. The rioters appear to be collapsing. What the hell's going on ? Someone must have gotten through. Are you..? Are you all right ? -Yeah. l'm okay, Deunan. Are you sure, Kestner has no hold on you ? There's only one person who's ever had a hold on me. You're not gonna like this. Get up. Where's Arges ? Where's the ship ?! Get back ! Leave me here. Get up. The backup always follows the point man. l'm just a bioroid. They can make another one. -Don't say that. We're not gonna leave you, Tereus. You're coming with us. No one can replace you. We need you. Arges ! What are you waiting for ?! Move your ass ! Come on, you heard him. Let's go. Come on, come on ! Let's go ! Nice of you to join us. Where am l ? What in the world... ? Man seems to yearn for his own destruction. lt seems so. Yet somehow his spirit always pulls him back from the brink. Perhaps, they are a race worth saving. You're a good partner... ...Deunan. l'll always protect you, even if the world comes to an end. Now, where have l heard that before ? Somebody told me that once. Must have been a smart guy. He's all right. You okay ? Yeah, l'm all right. He was her partner first. She'll have him and l'll find my own girl. Whatever. Maybe they'll make one for you. Next stop, Olympus.
