PRESENTS IN CO-PRODUCTION WITH A POLISH FILM INSTITUTE CO-FINANCED PRODUCTION Well, what is it? We'll save you! Now, that's an entrance! Checkmate, my dear! And cut! It's a print! Great work, Hanna! Who's the best detective in the world? Time to go home! Could someone unhook me? Hello! You... Watch it! Hi! I'll be running your errands until Maryśka gets you a new servant. The new script is in the camper. The new box diet will be here at 5:30, as you wanted. And the fitness instructor quit. - I'll be right on it. - I fired him. - Excuse me... - Holy... moly! What did I say about brats on the set? Forget it, no problem. - Daddy! - Kacper! - Have you seen that? - Kacper? - My little boy! Don't worry! - Is he okay? No problem. He'll be fine. Daddy will get you cotton candy. DETECTIVE BRUNO ANTIQUE PICTOGRAMS Come on! - What's this about Bruno? - He's cool! He can solve any mystery, and he's never let anyone down! We got it! I missed what he found! There will be cake and presents! - Presents? - Sure! From auntie, uncle, and us. Not from my parents. Every one of us expected a miracle when we got here. That we'd return to our homes, and things would be great. At least you have a home to return to. They'd have to want me back first. Right? This is my fourth place. I'll let you in on a secret. Auntie asked what you liked. I said treasure hunting, like you did with your parents. And they said, "Okay!" Don't just sit there, you gnome! Three, two, one! Oskar, Oskar, is with us here Here's our song for you, my dear Happy birthday, detective boy May your life be full of joy And now, Alek! Alek! Girls... Alek's been with us two years There is nothing that he fears Being silent is his way And his birthday is today - Happy birthday! - To whom? Alek! - And to whom? - Oskar! Happy birthday! The cake! Last one! Delicious, right? Really! Time for presents! Alek... Watch out! The other way around! - Thank you. - Happy birthday. Thank you! Thank you! There's a present for you too. To get it, you have to solve a difficult riddle. A task fitting a detective! I told you it was too difficult! Look for it! You're warm! - That's even warmer! - Hot! It's burning! It's lava! How did you get it, Oskar? The drawing showed a worm. Worm to bug, bug to caterpillar, caterpillar to cocoon, cocoon to butterfly. Simple. Open your present! - That was it? - How awkward! Do you like it? Very much! PRIVATE DETECTIVE ID Time to grab some grub! - Food! - You might like this! - Patti, no! - It's his present! - No, it isn't! - It is! - Give it back! - But it's for Oskar! Jesus! May I go to our room? Of course. I'll drop by later. You crossed the line. It's the penalty turtle for you! No smart phones and stuff! For a week! Oskar... I'm sorry about what happened. Those are very important papers. Why can't I get them? Because... they are official documents. They belong to you, but... grown-ups should keep them safe. If you'd like, we could look through them together. But later, we'll put them away again. Look. This is yours. We'll get a nice frame for it later. Want it? Checkmate, my dear! Stop it, we're not filming. - And I thought I was late. - You are. - Marysia's with the producers. - My Marysia? - But that's not even Bruno! - We all see it, Marysia. Speak of the devil! Great. Let's watch it then. There. Who shot that? - It's an image disaster for our show. - For you too, Bruno. A disaster, really? Everybody loves Bruno! Oh yeah? Take a look. "Moody star knocks over child." That's the message. That didn't happen! Why am I explaining myself? I said nothing happened! This isn't the end of the world. We'll publish an apology, and give a donation to the Red Cross. An apology? For being on this endless show? This is exactly about its future. We have no choice. Give it to him. Read it. "President attacks Bruno, Bruno hits the bookshelf, it falls onto him." Your finger! "The falling trophies hit his head. Triumphant President leans over him..." I see it. You want to kill me with a bookshelf? Who wrote this? Monkeys can do better! It's what the producers want. - Give me that! - Bruno... "Detective Bruno." Bruno. He's got my name. My hands, my legs, and my face! For now, we're going according to plan. We'll be shooting the season finale in a month. Bruno will have an accident. He will be replaced by a young, talented, and attractive policeman. - Who exactly? - Mikołaj Kapecki. Come on, who's gonna fall for that? He just joined the cast! Detective Kapecki! The camera really loves him! It loves me! Ceaselessly, for six seasons now! And one more thing! I love it too! Marysia, do something, or I'll explode! Hanna! You know we have a contract... - Wait! - Will you knock me down too? Come on. I didn't even touch the kid, he tripped over a cable. Look around! Lamps, props, scaffolding, wiring. Kids should be under lock and key. You're never going to change. You don't respect others. I don't know whom to be sorry for, that kid or you? You know how it is in showbiz. That footage is fake. But it showed who you really are. I really had good intentions. - Yuck! - Leave it! What are those strange marks? Let me see! - Go away! - Please! Let me see this! It's a riddle from my parents! - But they're gone... - Yes. At least I've got the riddle. This is how we played. You know what this is? - A treasure hunt? - Exactly, inspector Hanna. - They hid a present. - Left me see. Do you understand this? It looks incomplete. Old trick. Lemon juice ink. - I still don't get it. - Let me see. You need a codebreaker. My parents always helped. I know! You'll be my codebreaker! Forget it, gnome! After yesterday, I'm on parole. One slip up, and it's the turtle. Besides, you need a pro. - Bruno! - What? Detective Bruno can help me! - How? - Just like that. We'll find my present together! Talk to auntie and uncle first. They'll say I'm making it up or send me to the psycho again. Psychologist! Still, that will be it. You have to cover for me. I'll find him, Patts! You're nuts, gnome! I told you, they're watching me! - Patts? - Don't call me Patts! I'll give you my presents. You can play with them. Fine. Only because they ticked me off. And I had good intentions. They can't fire me. I am the show. I should quit. I've been turning down other offers for years. You don't get it. There are no other roles for you. Fight for this show. Otherwise, all the years of my hard work... I mean, our hard work, will go to waste. And with them, my... your comfortable life. Are you interested in hair color commercials? Where did they...? Oh no! Look! "Inside news on changes in the popular show! Mikołaj Kapecki will be the new detective." - Sweet Jesus! - What? - The blogger set up a survey. - So? Mikołaj is in the lead. What a mess! Don't you get it that without the viewers you're nobody? We need to warm up his image. - Origami with the seniors? - No. Painting the grass on presidential grounds? Bad idea. - Green beans eating contest. - No. Something with animals? PETS AMONG THE STARS I'm allergic. So what? That's a good idea. A truly great idea! Grab your phone, you're taking pictures. Tadeusz! Here you are, my boy! The hairball can finally be useful! - Here. - I'm allergic. Tough! Jesus! Give me the cat. Hold it like this. Smile. God. But we've got it. - Tissue, anyone? - Not now. - "I love pets," right? - Yes. "I love pets." Great. Bruno! Look, it's great! We have to let people see it. One like! Wonderful! Put a dog or cat in, and you'll win! Four likes! Ever since Missy opened up, we're together. Come to daddy! A round of applause, please! Where in blue blazes is he? Only when I met Gucci, it hit me that shoes and purses shouldn't be tested on animals. And here's another star for our pets! Please welcome Bruno Księski! Great to have you here! A round of applause! Greetings to you all. To start with, 10% of my pay from the next Bruno season will support the fight against animals. Sorry, the fight for animal rights. Bravo! Together we can do more. I already gave 20% of my pay for that cause. The fate of animals is very dear to me. I'm giving another 20% for animal shelters. Ten plus twenty is thirty. This was supposed to be a surprise. I have donated the entire income from the album to the shelter where I've met my beloved Brutus. Don't buy. Adopt! Don't buy! Adopt! Taking advantage of this unique opportunity I'd like to raise my involvement to 40%! Five? Fifty? Fifty percent. And how do you want to keep that promise if they say that the station wants to sidetrack you? Bruno! Help! Only you can help me! - Did you hire him? - Not me! What a young fan! What's your name? Oskar, good morning! I wanted Detective Bruno to help me solve a mystery. This is... a surprise. A reel... A fan... Talk! Windmill? Allow me! Mikołaj! Of course, I'll help. What do you need? These characters are probably... definitely... Cyrillic. And everything suggests that this is a clue. Bravo! This would be a good moment for a selfie. Agree to everything! Hold it up. It's a mirror image! House... Rabbit... The Rabbit House! You're the best detective in the world! Ladies and gentlemen, Detective Bruno is irreplaceable! - Let's go to the Rabbit House! - I'm really busy. This was just the first clue of the treasure hunt! A great adventure awaits! Just do it! You see how they're reacting! We'll go to the Rabbit House, for a great adventure with Detective Bruno! You have to come with an adult. We need their consent. - Walk him to the front desk. - No need! See you tomorrow! Tomorrow? You lucky guy! An image campaign came to you on its own. - Everything's fine. - Well... But a single lucky stunt won't solve everything. Tadeusz, let's go. Merely 500 likes. What's going on? You know who's car that is? You got bus fare? I do. What? That was fast. Got anything? Not yet. Bruno was busy, but he agreed to help me tomorrow. What if they find out that you're gone? - They won't. You'll cover for me. - Yeah, right! And for a gift? That's your dad's! It's the middle of the night, kids. Sleep! Dumb idea, let's go. Forget it, this kid is your last chance. Your like count increased. He could share this online. Fans like that. Leave sharing stories to Mikołaj Kapecki. I'm a serious artist. You got yourself into this mess. Now, deal with it! And don't forget about hashtags. #Detective Bruno, #investigation_revelation, #awake_staying_sharp. Maybe let's say he likes kids. I'm sorry! My tram was late! My tram... - Hello. - Hi. "I consent to... Oskar's participation in... a filming session with Detective Bruno. Signed..." Well, it's signed. Are you ready for an adventure with Bruno? I am! Checkmate, my dear! We're about to solve a puzzle! Let me see. The Roman numerals could be connected with past times. The Roman era? Aren't these the columns by the door? My little helper... - Oskar. - ...may be right! These arrows show the direction! This is like a scavenger hunt! And this could be... the number of steps. In a mirror image. Bruno, you're a genius! Let's go! We'll be counting steps from those columns. Follow us! That's the tree from the drawing! - I hope they're hospitable. - Let's wait. No time for that. Bruno, come on! Bruno, the tree. Zośka, photos. I'm the diplomat. Good morning! How's your mom? What a meeting! Ladies and gentlemen... Can you do it? Please welcome the Viva Vivaldi string trio under the baton of... Okay. Bruno Księski? I mean... maestro Federico Cavallo! Featuring Mr. Księski. Let's dance to their tune, my boy. Film over here! Easy. Bravo! Just come down now. Come on... Great. Bravo! Have you seen that? I'd like to fall like that myself! - Madam ambassador, please meet... - Maria Wiśniewska. Mrs. Wiśniewska. And this is Bruno Księski. I know him, of course. What a surprise! Fantastic performance. Amazing! Robin Delka. Attaché. Oskar Walczak. Attaché. The Free Republic of Upper Carpathia has a national holiday today. I invite you to the rest of the reception and the cake. Cake is always welcome. Enjoy. Silly me. You know what to do with this! Why me? Do I play with bricks? In episode two of season four you kept memory cards in such boxes. Oh yeah! "Look for four faces with pointing hands." Bruno, taxi. Great! We got it! - But the mystery isn't solved! - Oskar! I'm a busy man. I don't have the time. And so on! Of course! I haven't officially hired you yet. Will this do? No need for that. You'll do it for free? I knew you were a great guy! Okay. Let's sit. - Report, boss. - We're looking for my present! I don't know what shape it is, and if it's large or small. - What kind of present? - Birthday! Inspector Hanna is here to help us! Of course! And to bring you some cake! What are you up to? The kid has a riddle to solve. And I'm taking some photos. Using the boy to promote yourself? No. We have his parents' consent. He's overjoyed. - We're home! - Great! It was fun! Can we eat in our room? Sure. Maybe "piken"? No such word. "Ipken." "Piken." "Nipke." No. "Niepk." What is that? Patience, detective! Maybe... it is "Pekin"? "Pekin" or "Beijing." We're going to China? The Palace of Culture and Science is PKiN in short. Or "Pekin"! Well... The four clocks on the Palace! "Look for four faces with pointing hands." It's there! Great! But what is this puzzle piece? Maybe it will clear up at the Palace? So? Are we going? I can drive you. Kids! - What's this secrecy about? - Just some stuff. What kind of stuff? A present of uncle's Name Day. - But that's in a month! - We want to be ready. Okay. Yes? It's nice up here, and downstairs... the end is near. Join us in the yard later. Did you know the Palace of Culture has 42 floors and nearly 800 stairs? And it's 237 meters tall, antenna included? And there are cats in the basement, at some point, 60 of them! What do they eat? - Mice! - Right! Are you coming with us? I'm just helping the genius of deduction. But if real trouble comes around, you can count on me. Okay. The Palace, Oskar, Oskar, the Palace, attaché. Focus on the clock. When the large hand is on 12, and nothing happens, just scram home. And you? I'll be doing the same thing on the other side. We have to check all for clocks. Let's take one last selfie. - Why last one? - Just saying. Focus on the clock. Don't take your eyes off it. Large hand on 12, if nothing happens, run along home. The clock. - Are you free? - Not for the last 12 years. Get in. To the Film Studios. - You left your son there? - None of your business. I'm at peace with my wife. We don't have to do that with our kid. I'm not married. He'll find his way home. Such a small boy? You're gutsy. And the train station's so close. - What do you mean? - You don't know? Cops keep saying on the radio to have our eyes open for some missing kids. He's not that small. Stop! There you are! Yes. How many stairs did you say this place had? - Eight hundred. - A lot. My dad promised some day we would climb them to the top. No! What are you thinking? Come on. Why use the stairs, when we have elevators. It always has to be your way? There's something here! - Another puzzle piece. - What? You don't know? The same as... this one! Keep going! - You went through my purse? - Never. Give me back my 20! Kaja, stop it! Where's Oskar? Haven't seen him all day. - In the yard? - No. Maybe he went cycling. He doesn't have a bike. - He's at a friend's? - What's going on here? He was kidnapped by space aliens! Yeah? Let's see what my parents will say about that. Unless you come clean! He's with that actor? Why didn't you tell me? So cool! And my parents? They can't know about this. Are you nuts? It will be our fault! I'll tell them you sneak out at night! Oskar saw you. So did I. You're not as quiet as you think. Another one! This is my dad. You have to let us through. - No passage. - Really? Well, what can we do? But dad! Show it to him! I'm a detective. Let us through. Upstairs said nothing about it. That's where we're going, upstairs. They can call you. The boy is under my care. A crown witness. Codename "Son." The "Presi" operation? Do you want central command on your back? Here, 012ABC. That was some stunt you pulled. Dad? Come on, just 15 more floors! - No puzzle pieces! - Haven't had enough? Maybe we could check out the elevator? Another piece! This will be the first Palace of Culture summer ascent without oxygen. When I was your age, my dad brought me here every week. Thank you! Are you there? Don't forget we're shooting tonight. Don't worry. At this stage, every slip up makes your situation worse. I'll just finish up with Oskar.- You're still with him? We've got what we needed. The tabloids are with us. We just need the producers. Bruno! Just ditch the kid. We can hire another one later. Fine. A few pieces are missing, but it's mom and dad. And this... our canoeing trip. The whole family was nuts. Let's see the Mermaid. Come on! Catch me! No running here! Bruno! Stop running! What are you doing? Don't do that! What have you done? Oskar! Oskar! Stop running from me! That was my only photo. I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay. Let's see that Mermaid. Well, why not. - The result? - Two. Who's next? Now, it's me! Mom? Maybe I'll grab a pizza with Patti and Oskar? As an additional birthday present. Great idea! I'll get Oskar. He lost himself in that book from Alek. - Take Alek with you! - Sure! We'll give you money, save yours. He could give us away! What could I do? Just keep quiet! - No one can know... - Oskar isn't home? What? The Mermaid survived the war. Warsaw was in ruins, but she survived. - How do you know all that? - From my parents. Respect. I barely have an hour left. - So, get in there and check it. - No. Anything? - Not yet. - Go ahead! Come on! Found anything? Not yet. Great! Well? You do that in broad daylight? And now? No, nothing. Nothing there. Now what? Is that a storm? In your tummy! First, we eat, then we think. Mom? Wait a second, honey. A cockroach! - Where did you see it? - Under the table! Did you see it? Keep looking! Oskar, wait! Maja, get off the carpet! - We'll catch it! - Go! - We'll deal with this. - Sure! - We'll get the guy! - Hurry! May I? It's not here. Shouldn't you call your parents? They made you look for the present alone? I'm not alone. I liked playing with them, but you're cool too. We have to finish. Remember that episode with the Mermaid? You chased the crook in a kayak! That was great! You're right. All clues brought us to where we filmed the show. - In the Rabbit Park, I solved the... - Art theft case. Right. The Palace... Russian spies met there in the basement. - You remember? - Of course! And the Mermaid? - The Mermaid, kayaks... - Diamonds! Right. There's a bridge! - This is faster! - The bridge! I've had training! You saw the photo! Oskar! Get back! Oskar! Let me go! Ever heard of mooring lines? Let go! Come on! You'd sooner float down to the sea than reach the other side. Get out. Come on! Darn! Did they teach you skydiving too? No. But we sledged down the Tatras! This won't end well. Come on! Come! - Made it? - Yes. Oskar! No! This can't end well. Where to? - To the crocks. - Quiet! Why there? Diamonds were hidden in the pool. There might be a clue there. Easy... Just an elephant. They're very gentle. Let's not test its patience. It could weigh three tons. Adults as many as six. What an adventure, right? This way! We shouldn't be here! But the diamonds were in the pool! I'm on one side You're on the other How can I send you my kiss I will send it on a leaf My beloved... Bruno? You here? That's how I hid from those thieves. I'm sorry, madam... I just wanted to show my TV son where we shot an episode. Don't you recognize me? - We've met? - Aniela Kuc! We met when you were filming! You were afraid of my lizards! Really? It was the cold water. - You'll be a wonderful dad! - Right! - What are you doing here after hours? - It's after hours? Time flies! You promised to call, but you were busy fighting crime! How are the crocks after the fight in the diamonds episode? Bruno had an infection, but now he's fine. Bruno? Bruno! A nice couple adopted him and called him that. - What was their name? - Well... - The Walczaks? - My parents! Maybe they left me a clue! I was supposed to pass a massage! Something about... a map and Zosia? That was some time ago! It rhymed! Yes! "On the map Zosia'll wait, and it's eight!" - There! - I don't know any Zosia. Well, think! Do you know their address? Of those people? You don't know them? Long story. Don't want to bore you. I was going to call them. There's some trouble with the adoption fees. Can't help you now. The office is closed. And I really have to go. If you learn anything, just let me know. I'll give you my number. I have to go to the film studio. I'll drop you off at home. - Where do you live? - Close by. Close by what? That studio of yours. Okay. Good evening. - It's you! - Yes. To the Film Studios. May I see how you work? I'll be quiet as a cat! - Rather as a mouse. - As a mouse! You say, "Cool as a cat." Cats are cool? Of course they're cool... - I'll take you on the set. - Great! Just be quiet as a bunny. As a bunny? - A rabbit. - Really? A mouse or rabbit? Rabbits aren't that quiet. I used to have a dwarf rabbit. Its name was Zygfryt. It was so noisy, you couldn't sleep. Unfortunately, an eagle got it. - An eagle? - My dad saw it happen! Wait here. This will take a moment. Don't go anywhere! There he is! Bruno on the set, let's get to work! Help me with the shoes. Now we're shooting the interiors... - Give me my lines. - Right. You just say, "All that counts is the truth." All that ever counted was the truth. That's all. One scene. Jacket. We have to start. Everyone on the set! Camera, please! Gun! Get ready! Action! I'll get you this time, you dog! I'll get you, you dog! I'll get you! Hands up! Easy! Let me see them! I told you not to snoop around. All that ever counted was the truth. Really. This time, I'll get you, you dog! Don't kill him! Police! Get yourself! Did I mix up the episodes? What's going on? Whose kid is that? - Mine. - Another publicity stunt? This is crazy. Grab the hero, and let's work. - You won't kill him? - Not today, in a month. You'll have to get me first! I'll walk him out. A told you to stay put, right? - You keep running off! - I have to go! Hanna, protect him, okay? You crossed the line. Why go there if they don't like you? Just for Hanna? I knew it! - You like her! - Oskar! - Maybe you even... - Stop it! - ...love her! - You better watch it! We have... a professional relationship. Based on mutual respect. Actually, one-sided, but respect. It's nothing like... you know. What can you know about this at your age? About love? Seems that more than you. - Done? - Not in another two hours. Now, just take the kid home. It was a blast. See you. If he tries to shoot you again, get him with this. A flashlight? Thanks. "On the map Zosia'll wait." What's that mean? I don't know. We'll solve it some other time. Make sure he locks the door. Where to? Didn't Bruno tell you to take me to his place? This is fire! Hello! Where are you, you gnome? It's supper time. I know. I can't come. You have to help me, Patts! That's so funny! I won't cover for you anymore. Please, Patts! Auntie wanted to check on you twice. Distract her. She'll forget about it. Okay, but don't ever call me Patts again! Patts, Oskar! Don't argue, or I'll be right up! We'll be nice! You're all making me so angry! Be here tomorrow. Kaja, can you help? - Auntie? - What is it? Alek fell in love with Kaja. Jesus Christ. Let's swallow this bitter pill somehow. - How old are you? - Fifteen. And you, Kaja? - Sixteen. - Right. Are you sleeping? He'll stop snoring. I know him. Okay. Goodnight then. Goodnight. - Don't scare me, man! - What are you doing here? - Breakfast. Where's the cereal? - No cereal. You slept here? - You said to drive me home. - Your home! You need to be more specific. Time to leave! - I'm busy. - Pillaging my kitchen? A good day starts with a good breakfast. - Then we continue! - Your folks know you're here? I live with my aunt. She knows. Dial her number. Go on. Call her! - Hello? - Good morning. Bruno Księski. I'd like to speak with the guardian of Oskar... Walczak. ...Walczak.- I'll get my aunt. Hello, sir. Did you know that Oskar spent the night in my house? I did. Everything's fine. Give me your address, and I'll drop him off. But I'm leaving for Morocco. - He can stay with you. Goodbye. - Hello? Maybe she had a plane to catch. Did you find anything besides this sawdust? Weird but tasty. Bruno... Where is your gun? In the sock drawer. - Where? - In the wardrobe. Stop it, I don't keep guns at home. And poison pens? I have no weapons at home. That's why you wanted to whack me with a sculpture. It's not a sculpture. It's an award. I got it many years ago when I was the hope of Polish theater. Ever tried it with salt? Holy moly. Hanna! - What's going on? - Hello! You tell me. When you can't solve a mystery, you always call the inspector. I did too! - How did you call her? - On the phone! I'm sure, but it had a PIN code. Code, phone, fridge. Breakfast! Won't call you again! You can't play any longer. You have to go. I'll say he's sick. They'll come up running. I'll say it's contagious. Diarrhea, virus, and stuff. What if he's hurt? That will be on you! Tell them. - Have you eaten? - I had lots of sugar! - Really? - Yeah! Oskar called me to help you solve the mystery of the girl from the zoo. - Bruno? - Let me! - When I was drowning... - He had too much sugar. We met Anielka at the zoo. - She took care of Bruno. - Oskar... But that's what happened! She said Bruno was her favorite. She gives him the best bites. Oskar, tidy up the kitchen, Hanna, to the bedroom. He sneaked in here. When I came home, I didn't notice him. And eight-year-old tricked a master detective? He's been turning my life upside down since yesterday. You think I like it? - Should I throw him out? - Take him home! What home? Where? I spoke with his aunt over the phone. She left for Morocco. On vacation. And the mystery girl from the zoo? You're using the single-dad pick up technique? Those crazy parents left a clue there. And they named a crock Bruno. Rightly so. It's a slimy creature. Aniela, the crock minder, promised to send their address. There's nothing between us. Here it is. What? She sent it. They'll send me away again. My parents have never sent anyone away. Oskar was out all night. We have to find him. Oskar was out... all night? What? Ready? Let's go. - We'll solve the mystery! - Yes. But first, we'll take you home. And on the way, we'll think about the riddle. Right. Well? Oskar sneaked out to find his present from his parents. - What present? - How did he sneak out? He saw me go out through the terrace. There was a clue in the envelope from the party. Jesus! Jesus Christ! What if he's hurt? He slept in the park and froze to death! - It's 30 degrees, he's fine. - How do you know? - From the thermometer. - How do you know he's fine? Spill it. He's with that actor. I talked to him. I'm gonna have a heart attack. What actor? Show me. - They'll take away our kids. - Wait. The Marion Agency. Let's go. You stay! - My phone! - Forget it! Great. What's wrong? Come on. Scoot over. Morning! Which neighbor has such famous friends? I'm looking for Oskar Walczak's parents. Oh my. They're not here. How can I contact them? Dear boy... They are both dead. I liked playing with them, but you're cool too! My dad promised some day we would climb them to the top. That was my only photo. How did it go again? - On the map Zosia'll wait, and it's... - Eight! Maybe it's about some monument? Or a street name? Zofia Nałkowska's Street? Or the "Zośka" Battalion? Here. The neighbor said it happened in May. They had no family here. She doesn't know where the boy is. She asked if I knew anything. We're just looking for a present. The last one from his parents. Poor boy. Marysia! Not now! Bruno... Is Oskar still with you? His guardians are here. They're really bonkers. - We heard you! - That's right! They've seized my Tadeusz. Hold him, please. The phone. Honey... Nice kitty... Hello? Return Oskar to us immediately! - We'll call the cops! - I'll call the cops! - How could he? - I know! You kidnapped him! But we're taking him home now! - Goodbye. - They're at Marysia's? - Holy moly! - Oskar? I think he... Bruno! He marked something here. The Rabbit Park. Palace of Culture. The Mermaid. The zoo. The zoo! It's not "Zosia"! "On the map zoo shall wait!" Think, Bruno! Got a pen? "On the map zoo shall wait, and it's eight." Here. Eight. Intersection. The Film Studios. Checkmate, my dear. Let's go. I'd sooner expect an earthquake than a visit. - You know what this is? - A poison dart blowpipe. What a smart boy! I don't want to guess anymore. - Got anything for me? - What can I say? This stuff doesn't belong to me. But I could give you a pen. Want one? No, thanks. Got one at home. I hoped to solve the mystery here. I did better with Bruno. Detective Bruno? He's my best friend. We're looking for a present from my parents. What's your name, boy? - Oskar Walczak. - That's something! Come with me. Marysia, put the guy on. Please, don't shout! Change of plans. I'm sending you an address. See you there. Oskar, you better be there. Shouldn't we go with them? We should keep an eye on them. Call a cab. The Satan's chariot? Out of the question! Burn rubber, girl! Happy birthday! Don't you like your present? I do. It's cool, not too new. Sometimes, what counts is who is making the present. Not the gift itself. Right? Here! Go forward! There. Stop right here. Oh God! Hurry! Oskar! Bruno, you've found me! I solved the riddle, let's move on! Let go, boy. It's over. You've found your present. It's not a present but another clue. The adventure is over. You're going home, I'm going to work. No! There is always another clue! That's what you said! On television. I'm an actor, not a detective. If that's so, how did you know where to find me? Listen. I've done all I could. You're a pretender! You even pretended we were friends! It's okay. You were great! So full of empathy! Bruno, you've found me! I solved the riddle, let's move on! That was his best performance. Worthy of an Oscar. Right! CAREER SAVED! GOOD WINS NOT JUST ON-SCREEN BRUNO LOVES CHILDREN An unexpected turn of events! Bruno Księski, the modern-day boogeyman, rules on the internet! The help he gave to some kid saved his career! This will be the hit of the season! - Where is he? - Not here yet. I keep calling. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to our annual TV Series and Life gala! You're finally here! Come on, take a seat. I see you're having fun. The actors are the heart of TV series. And now, let's welcome the presenter of the first award, the queen of Polish TV series! The winner of four consecutive Best Actress awards of the TV Series and Life magazine. Aisha! I'll read out the verdict on behalf of our star. Aisha, any comments? As voted by the readers, the Most Popular Actor of the Year is... Bruno Księski! Bravo! Congratulations. Here you go. It's a pretty heavy award. I'll use it to chase away insistent fans. Especially one... who taught me that if even just one person believes in you it means that you are real. This award isn't for me. It's for all those who through their love and belief in what we do make our show. It's for all those beautiful and talented people you don't see here, without whom I don't exist. Who know every detail of the show, with my shoe size, and the hole in my hat. The hat... The hat! You! You! Wait! Why are you running? Hold this. Why are you running? Don't go. Stay here. Why are you running from me? And that's show business for you! Bravo! Stop! - Why? - I know what you're capable of. I need your help. My help? Do you even know my name? - Excuse me? - Basia! After six years, I don't even have a photo with you to show my mom. Sorry for being rude. Sorry for underestimating you. Basia. Wait! So? What is it? You should remember this. The episode with the hat with a hole in it. With a competition for the parents. It's in editing. Thanks! Mommy! Bruno! What are you pulling? Get back in there! I have a matter to attend to. You against me? You're fired! You're fired! I decide who gets fired, and I quit! Okay. Where are your water wings? Tell me... how will we pack all this? Oh my... Oh come on! It's so hot! Forget it! It's the Polish seaside. It will be cold. Did you pack your chessboard? Yes? Great. I'll join you in a few days. Will you look out for our crew? Can I count on you? Maks? Stop kicking the seat. Kaja, remove his sandals! - Kaja! - Drink! A gas station is up ahead. I'll get you something. Pee! Pee! Keep it down, kids! Holy moly! - Is Oskar in? - Should I call the cops? I apologize. I'm sorry. I should've called you, and taken Oskar home. I didn't. Sorry about that. We didn't do so well either. The family is on their way to the seaside. - Turn them around! - No way, goodbye. You have to see this. Hello? Dad? Mom, this is important. Yes? Hold on! Come on in. Take your seats. Hi, Oskar. Oskar... you were right. There's always another clue. - What's this? - A surprise! Just wait! Checkmate, my dear. DETECTIVE BRUNO Wait! That's not all. Meet the contest winners! Happy birthday, sonny! You solved the case, little detective! Come on, do the heart! We love you infinitely! The best present ever. Are we friends? THE CHECKMATE THEATER Only two people knew the vault combination. The bank director and his assistant Esmeralda. You won't wriggle out of this! Now you! We've retrieved the original! Inspector, please arrest Esmeralda! What? But I can't go to prison! There's no internet there! He did it! The director can solve the Rubik's cube faster than Justin Bieber. You couldn't solve even one side! You're guilty! Detective Oskar, you are the best! - Checkmate, my dear. - Checkmate! Bravo! Director! - Bravo! - Encore! Here you go. You're a director now? And you're retired. You have to know when it's your time. Truce? Sure, auntie. Your father would've been proud. Look who's here. - Here. - Let me cut it! Hi! Sorry I missed your premiere but I had to pick someone up. This is my daughter Zuzia. My name is Walczak. Oskar Walczak. Come on!
