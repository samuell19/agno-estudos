Right it's feeding time! Right, come on, don't be shy. Come on, hustle hustle, there's starving kids in Africa. Here you go, come and get it, the faster you eat the faster we get to work. We got to get the runts out more. The search needs to extend past just the boy. I know, I've heard it before. I was reading that they says here that there must be a fallin' of hope in order to find the justice in things. You can't have a hero that's lost all his hope. It's about the testin' and then the rebuildin' phase. Bein' rebuilt, that's justice. I can't even read this. It'll probably be some TV drivel soon. I can't take this. It's right where you put it. I'm tell you it wasn't there before. That boy's got a mind of his own. Okay, it's not me you're fixin' on. Blamin' the boy like you'd allow 'em next to this science experiment. Best be weary of that temper of yours it's gonna getcha in trouble. I know it's around the corner, but them plants are gonna need taking care of. Yeah, I got the boys out there. Gotta clear out the dead roots first. It'll be a good season, don't you worry. I just don't get why we're not flyin' yet, ya know? There's islands out there and plants and, animals. We could cash in the crop and we can take the boys with us. You can write your own books, it'll just be peaceful all around us. You know the walk between justice and family is a thin line. We're doing a good thing. So for us we got to keep our heads in the game. Well, did you win? Ah, Fliny always says don't be afraid to use yourself if you ain't got the means. I guess you did just that, so take care of it. I know you found us some good out there boy. How many miles? No matter, it's our night now. City targets is our territory. That's a hell of a shot boy. Pack up. I have a felling something drew us here. Give it more punch, try it again. Hey man, need some help? We can't figure this engine. Do you know the F series? I've worked on a few but this looks like a '70 and they're kind of rare. She's a hand-me-down from my uncle. He never mentioned all the problems. Ain't that how it always goes. The gift that keeps on giving. - Yes. - Yeah. I guess the real gift is. Is not human. Built from the ground up like a god. This one here hid behind his identity. Behind his money. Only traveled by night. Flew through the darkness to save an entire city. It didn't work though. It never does. You are weak. You didn't even make it through the first round. We're gonna play a little game, you're gonna pretend that your life isn't already over. You know we're not out looking for trouble, we just know that unless you can be rebuilt you are not a hero. It's not our call who the heroes are, its whoever can last. And you definitely did not. I feel like I'm talking to myself. One day you'll be in charge here. Fliny and I will be on the road somewhere. The markers are getting better. You're learning, every time you're learning. You're looking out for your old man. There you go. Kick it, go ahead. That's right. Put it out! There you go, that's my boy! Yeah! Kick it! Let's go, kick it, put it out! Put it out! There you go, kick it, go ahead! Marking your territory like a stray huh? Whoa, afraid of strangers kid? I don't blame you, probably don't want to get another one of those. It's pretty impressive. Listen if you're gonna do this got to have a flow to it. It's like music. You ever listen to music? No? It's alright, it all sounds the same anyway. Look, you just got to be careful out here doing this. Alright, you got to keep your hands clean cause you don't want people catching on. So, look you're already destroying the wall you might as well not get your hands dirty. You got to be smart about it. Guessing breakfast was a couple days ago huh? God, slow down I got more. Hey. Did your parents give you a name? I'm guessing they don't exist do they? But you got owners though right? Everybody's got someone who owns them. Where your keepers at? See the problem is if you're a runaway I'm gonna have to take you home because those keepers are gonna want you back. Hey, what's your name kid? They call me boy. Adam. Boy Adam, that's your name? It's what the owners call you isn't it? I have to go home now. What you go a curfew? When it's nighttime. This place looks pretty empty, you sure those keepers got a place for you? Hmm? Out here with the wolves huh. Hey, that big farm right there, that you? Alright. Well we stay out here much longer we're gonna be predators meat so you best get yourself back inside now. Come on, bring 'em over, bring 'em over, bring 'em over. Come on, come on, come on. Colin, you got to crack the crust. There you go. Oh damn. Y'all need to get bigger ones than this, you're looking sad. This is it. There ain't no escaping what's coming. We got a new spot, I'm branching out into the waste lines. We've seen here, I want you to find me something there. And maybe we'll find a good house guest. Questions just kept coming. And there I was. In the shadows, searching. And this was everyday. No answers. Again, and again, and again. Until one day I asked myself the right question, is it really about what's to learn? I mean there's hints sometimes. You ask yourself questions like, "How is it possible for them to do this to me?" Or better yet, "Is the common denominator me all these times?" Really what you should be saying is it's not for me to understand, but it is for me to accept. I don't know. Maybe it's not their fault. But I'll tell you one thing, it's sure as hell not mine. And it's not yours either. If you continue to search, you will continue to fail. Right, I'm gonna get off my soap box. Whose ready? My name's Holton. What's up Holton? Wasn't alcohol for me, it was the people that used it that made me toxic. I've always found myself gravitating toward problems. I think deep down inside, whether I like it or not, its what I'm always chasing. Chaos. I know like you said it's not on me to understand, it's on me to accept. Al-Anon is for those of us who are dealing with the people who have the problems, and it's funny, I think sometimes it makes us think that we don't have 'em. I've always been straight edge, I've never had a drop of alcohol, not a cigarette, nothing. I've never even been curious. But if all you ever knew was chaos would you ever be able to change? I think the way I grew up and some of the things that I saw, things that happened to me, made me want to go against that grain and live a clean life. But it also left me toxic. So that's why I'm here, I want to be able to trust my gut and live my truth and let it guide me everyday. Hey man, that was good today. You're opening up. Yeah, I'm just trying not to run from the problem anymore you know. I figured you'd crack me eventually. Yeah, it takes some work but we all come uncorked at some point. I'm with you there. Its good to see a new face in group by the way. My name's Karlhin but you can call me Kar. Yeah, I'm Holton, I've been coming here for a couple weeks. Sorry, being too formal. Well I guess this is what the party looks like when you grow up straight edge. Yeah this is pretty much what you would find there, coffee and some sugar, some shots of cream. That's better than letting the bottle make your choices for you though isn't it? It's true. Al-Anon isn't about separation though, it's about guidance through accepting behavior. And that's a tough lesson to learn. But I guess time has wised us up huh. Yeah. Well just that when you've had a breakthrough you're gonna want to keep it consistent. Come back, don't abandon it. Well you're a real straight shooter and I appreciate that. Hey. I'll see you next week. Sounds good man. It's a veggie patty. My brother'd skin me alive if he heard me say that. Well, it helps clean the poison out, clears my head. No meat, no alcohol, no friends, no fun. Nothing. I'm a clean soul now. I can't have friends. That's what I was told. Listen, whoever owns you is creeping too deep inside. You're not letting the man in here shine through. Hey look, I made something I'm proud of, you ever do that? No. Look, this here's a list. It's a book but I make lists in it, helps me figure things out. You see anything I put in this book comes true. All you got to do is write it down. That's how I make things I'm proud of. Know how to do that? Well good, your owners are doing better job than I thought. This book, it helps me to create, it helps me to craft and it's all kept in here, it doesn't go anywhere else, it's for my eyes only. Any thought, any idea I ever have, I let it rest in here cause it helps to get it out. Cause when you write things down it takes what's in here and makes it real, does that make sense? The boys have taken to bed, I suggest you do the same. The boy's heading back soon and we got another visitor. Always bringing trash in here like that. You've got to be my favorite little hoarder. Watching you flirt is like watching a car wreck. Well it's an early start tomorrow and I ain't got much flirtin' left. You drew these? Yeah. This wasn't exactly what I meant when I told you to write things down. This is something else. What are these drawings of? Things I see. - Hey Kar? - Yeah. You have a second to chat? Yeah, sure, shoot. I was just thinking, this process we talk about, these proceedings, you think it's possible to get someone out of it while they're in it or would they have to grow up with it and then recognizee the patterns? Okay, you're either asking for a friend or you're sharing outside of group. It's a boy. He's a good kid but it seems like there's some broken support beams at home. Is his family not around? Well that's the thing, he definitely has owners but seems like they're sort of leading him sideways a little bit. So you think they're users. Either that or there's something that happened in the past. I mean there's a lack of social cues in place. So you're his lookout. Something like that. It's always difficult when children are involved, would there be an opportunity to talk to the kid or? Would you think that would be the best move? It depends, is it dangerous? I don't know that yet. I see. Well all I can tell yah is guests are always welcome and the door is always open. Alright, thanks for your help Kar. Appreciate it. Anytime Holton. Take care. It's easy, see. That's it. So one every two spaces over. You see germs are a boy's best friend, but dirt's my biggest enemy. This way them feet of yours won't be tracking in dirt and seeds and all kinds of grime. It'll finally be clean for once when the season starts. Well come on boy, it ain't gonna bite you. Go in and grab that. There you go. Take that mallet. I'm gonna give you a countdown. I want you to come down on it hard, as hard as you can, you hear me boy? Alright. Three. Two. One. Do it again. Again! Come on boy, hit it. Do it again. Go! Hit! Yeah, good boy! Hit it hard! Feels good doesn't it. Go get another one. He showed these to me. - Oh Jesus. - What? You think it's serious. Yeah, this is abuse and neglect. How long did it take him to show you these? Like a week. Where can I find them, the family? Eagle Valley, they got a farm out there. You gonna help me with this big fancy dinner? Y'all earned this one. It's just for gathering during the season, I'm gonna stuff you like kings. Go round up the boys, go on. Oh hello. I was wondering if I could have a word with you for a minute? I run group out in Etna and I just came by to extend an invitation. Speak. Okay, you'll have to excuse me, my name's Karlhin, you can call me Kar. That's not a name, that's an automobile. That's true. I guess my parents had a strange sense of humor. You selling something? No, no no no. Your son, a friend of mine received some drawings from him recently and they're pretty explicit. Maybe I should just show 'em to yah. Take a look at these. I'm sorry, I'm not explaining myself very well. I'm a counselor and honestly I really just came out here to tell you about the group that I run and reach out. You know in situations like these, not that there's any kind of situation, I'm not assuming there's any kind of situation but I felt it was best after seeing these drawings to reach out and maybe even meet your son. What seems to be the problem? Oh, no problem at all. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, I'm spreading the word about a meet and greet that I run that helps families in need. Oh. Excuse me, I don't think we've been properly acquainted. I'm Artik. I'd shake your hand but I'm covered in cooking oil and kid germs. Oh, no problem at all. I appreciate you sparing me. I'm sorry about Fliny, she's a bit touchy around people she hasn't dealt with before. I understand. These meetings are about the neighborhood. No, is your son at home? Yeah, yeah, the whole family's inside. Well a friend of your son's brought something to the forum that I run. A friend of his? Yeah. Huh, yeah. The boy is more of a conversationalist than the other kids. I see. Well these drawings, I just figured I would pass them onto you. Ah huh. He's being reading a lot of comics. Oh I see. We're fixing to get supper but these. Of course, I didn't mean to impose, I was just in the neighborhood and I figured I'd stop by. No no, it's okay. No reason to be sorry. No no, thank you so much for talking to me, I can come back and I'm really sorry for the misunderstanding. If that's what works for you okay. Have good night. Please apologize to your wife for me. Fliny is a bit jumpy. Enjoy your dinner. Hey! Would you like to join us? We have enough fixings to go around and you can come look in the place. Might ease your mind. Oh um, yeah okay, sure. That'd be nice. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure. Fliny likes to cook for a small army. Oh, well I appreciate it. I appreciate it a lot. It's not everyday. Goddammit Artik! Not in here. We just laid out the dirt floors, how we gonna get this clean? Come on, come on, get back. Hi Kar. There you are. Allow me to introduce you to my magic workshop. This is where the research is done. It's kind of like a melty barn. Please. Please. Please. Please. But I'm afraid because of the situation. I'm going to have to get my hands dirty. Whose this friend? The one who knows the boy? You may ask yourself, is my mind back in control now? I think that's probably the understanding of where we're all heading. I like to keep my surroundings clean. Wait! Wait! Wait! What's your connection to the boy?! No more chances. You're gonna have to forgive me for what's coming. Wait, wait. Are you the new speaker? Hi, Sarah. Holton, it's a pleasure. Yeah, Kar's out all week. He didn't mention being out. Actually we were expecting him but, do you need a meeting? I mean any of us are here, any of us could do it. No, no thank you, I appreciate that. Okay. I just needed to talk to him. Well we'll be here all week, so let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Okay. Oh shit. Hey, it's alright. Come on. Come on. Lets go. Right here. I take it you are a friend of the boy. It figures. I don't what your connection is to the boy but this land is mine and you are marked the second you take a foot on it. What are all those kids doing out there? Why are they all locked up? Sometimes being locked up sets a man free. Where's Kar? You're gonna tell me what your connection is to the boy! Whatever it is you fear most it's coming for you. I'm writing story about finding something that's pure. The story isn't over. Purity exists in this world, the problem is the drivel, these heroes could not save us. That's not real life now. The story I'm writing, that's real. I don't like that we're having more visitors. He knows something about the boy. Tough shit, we got to get rid of him. Something about the boy that we don't know. He can still make mistakes. Okay, I'll take care of the boys and we'll take care of the harvest and you take out that trash that's been stinking up my barn. I don't know what's coming to me but if it gives Adam a better life than go ahead. I have to protect the boy, which is why I'm going to give him your gun. It's something to remember you by. Words and threats, it's all I hear. Real torment comes from within, that's why these boys listen to you. Cause deep down, you're the one relying on them and they don't need you. Really? I'm telling you that you chase purity and I live it. And if that's what you're after why don't you come take mine away from me? Huh? Come on! Let him free! Let him free! Why is he taking so long? We need to try something new. I need your help. Dammit. I need the alcohol. We were saving this for leaving. Go on, take it. The normal methods aren't going to work. What does a man without fear fear the most? So the boy says you don't even drink, that's good because the more of this poison that goes in yah, the more you become the little blueprint you ran away from your whole life. You're gonna have to open your mouth boy. More. More! Come on! I want more! Come on, I'm ready. Bring me more. Get up boy! I got something for you. There, that's more comfortable. Oh, there you go. Not a bad view right boy. Ah you're thinking it again. The boy has his own free will. He's coming into his manhood, ain't yah boy. I almost forgot, this isn't for me. This is for you. I can't toast myself. This one's for me. And this one is for you boy. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing?! Someone's got to teach the boy how to toast before having a drink. Leave him be. I don't see no problem with sharing a good time with the boy. No I definitely don't see any trouble in that. Top it off for you. Now this is what adults have on a good day. Stop it. One, you raise it up high. Yes. Raise it to him. And now you take a drink. Go on. Stop. Adam, don't drink that. He has his own free will. One more, now you got to keep it in this time. Adam. Now its gonna have a little bit of a kick to it but I ain't sent you wrong yet. Come on, I ain't even putting up a fight. It ain't fighting, this is how your mom and dad play after a long day at work. Someday if you want to grow up you're gonna have to take a sip. We ain't got all day. There you go. Again, drink it up. Give me that! Hey, hey! Adam, stop it! Goddammit, leave him alone! Stop it! You watch this! Drink it! Dammit leave him alone! Go! Hey, hey! I'm gonna make you feel what he just felt. Boy. Go out and prep the tarp. Bring the CAT around, get a shovel, dig a hole. Go out and dig a hole boy or I'll make two. Now! Shit. I was thinking maybe that friend of the boy's really is the one that I've been searching for. A true hero. Pain don't bother him. He actually moves like he's living in some state of constant meditation. Then I had an epiphany, that when anger comes so does the truth. That's when I realized when something happens with the boy that upsets you, you're not pure inside. I left your friend out there. And soon you'll be able to join him. Make it stop! Get away from him! Oh hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay sweetie. Come on, give me the gun, hmm? Come on. Come on sweetie, give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun! Come on, we got to get to the car. Here, give me the gun. Go go! Come on! Get you! Fliny! Fliny! Fliny!
