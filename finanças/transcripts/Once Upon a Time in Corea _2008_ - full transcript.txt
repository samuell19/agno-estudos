Seoul, October 4th, 1944 Japanese colonial rule IM Pictures Presents Production WYNN Entertainment Distributed by CH Entertainment Executive Producer CHOI Wan I apologize, sir... For interrupting your evening. You have 5 minutes. I know where to find the 'Light of the East'. 30 years have past since Seokguram's excavation. Countless people have searched for the 'Light of the East'. The last king of Silla, King Kyung-soon searched for his son, Prince Mai in... The story of Prince Mai is nothing but a legend. Winners make history and losers make legends, sir. 'Origin of Silla Records'? If you ignore Prince Mai's story, there is no diamond. Do you know why, sir? Prince Mai was not one man... But two. Legend says when Silla surrendered to Goryeo, Prince Mai was so ashamed... He went up to Mt. Geumgang and died of starvation. But this book records 2 out of King Kyung-soon's 8 sons... Lived in Yong-moon temples in Yang-pyung. It also says Prince Mai's cane was struck into the yard at the temple. And it became a 1000 year old ginkgo tree. Striking a cane symbolizes losing something great. Thus, it means that the prince who left Silla died. The ginkgo is the symbol of Silla's 1000 year reign, 'Light of the East'. The diamond must be there with the prince's remains. It better be! Or you'll pay the consequences! Found it! It's a real diamond, sir. Now for the final test at Seokguram! PARK Yong-woo LEE Bo-young KIM Soo-hyun, SUNG Dong-il KIM Yong-soo, AHN Gil-gang CHO Hee-jong, KIM Goo-taek LIM Hyung-joon, KIM Myung-soo Produced by KANG Hyun-woo Screenplay by CHUN Sung-il Associate Producer KIM Seong-min Director JEONG Yong-ki Long live the Emperor of Japan! Long live the Emperor of Japan! Japanese Empire forever! Japanese Empire forever! Hurrah! Hurrah! Seoul, July 21st, 1945 Koreans and Dogs Restricted Sir Kanemura! Your table, sir. How's business these days? Enjoy your evening. Thank you, sir. Sir! Why'd you come out here? Heard anything, yet? No. Why aren't they contacting us? I'm frustrated, too. - Hey. - What? Someone sat on you when you were young, right? Aye or nay? # After a long day # Looking exhausted # You sit down # And with weak eyes # You look at me # Down the lonely path # Tired from the world # But I won't stay # Forever still # Like this again # It's okay if I'm alone # It's okay 'cuz I'm alone # I don't need anything # I'm going my way # I love you # With all my heart # In search for my dreams # I fly to the sky # Though I may fall # And get bruised, I won't regret # My beloved dream # My way Colonel Yamada! Have a seat, Haruko. Did you enjoy the song? Yes... Well, enjoy your evening, then. Sir Kanemura! Guess what's inside. What is it? I don't know. I didn't open it. How did you do that? Now, make a wish. Going to Russia and opening a jazz bar. A wish fit for the best singer in the country. A pearl necklace! It's absolutely gorgeous! I went to Russia on business and thought of you. Allow me, Haruko. I'm going away on business for a few days. How about accompanying me? Thanks for the pearls. There is a man named Kanemura who comes to the bar. Find out who he is. Something suspicious about him? Yes, sir! The Emperor of Japan gave it to the king of Baekje 2000 years ago. From generation to generation the kings of Baekje bowed before it. It was called 'The Sword of Loyalty' to the Emperor of Japan. A true warrior's sword must not rust for thousands of years. Only you, boss, Are its true owner. The Sitting Buddha Sculpture from the Three Dynasties era. The Buddha sculptures from Korea are quite exquisite. And they are highly recognized throughout the world. I've heard of your great reputation sir and rushed over. Thank you for your time. My man. Business going well these days? Not bad... What brings you here, sir? Drop the formalities. But you're a customer. How's the relics excavation going? Good. There're too many to dig up. The relics contain our national spirit. Who cares? When you're short on cash. Got my goods? Goods? Oh that... Of course not. They're not easy to find. Come on. There's nothing you can't get. You don't want business with me? Well... I'm not used to doing business with someone so lofty as you, sir. Good day, sir. Take it. No need, it's 100% pure gold. Made in Korea. There's no Korean gold around. It's all shipped to Japan. The goods? Young folks these days have no manners. Whatever you say. What are you trying to sell off this time? You'd be shocked, if you knew. Haedanghwa Ichiban's chairman Yimamoto's house... The curator of the national art museum's house... And now the military police colonel's house has been robbed! Very sorry, sir. We're putting all our forces to... I want the thief caught, now! We are doing the best we can. I have an appointment with the prosecutor. Look, you fool! AHN Joong-geun! The pride of the AHN family! What other fool would cut their fingers and do such a thing? Dr. AHN Joong-geun is... He's no doctor! He's a violent terrorist and murderer! Yes, sir... But... His family origin's from Soon-heung. I'm from the Duk-poong AHN family. Who cares? You're all the same compatriots! There's no proof you're not Haedanghwa! Is there! I've arrested Haedanghwa and got a full confession. The culprit is a descendent of the terrorist AHN Joong-geun. His fingers were intact to confuse the investigation and... Inspector Hasekawa! How many Haedanghwas have you arrested so far? 17, sir. And how many of the stolen goods were retrieved? None. That's why you Koreans will never get anywhere! Don't create a Haedanghwa! Go catch him! Koreans... Send 'Light of the East' to homeland Send-off Party for 'Light of the East' Mr. Kanemura! What brings you here this morning? Haruko! Sir Kanemura? It's unbelievable. But you've become even more ravishing since I last saw you. Really? I've been invited to the send-off party for 'Light of the East'. How about going together? Good. I've been invited, too. I knew that. So we'll be going together, then. What's all the fuss about the 'Light of the East'? It's a 3000 karat diamond. 3000 karats? It's worth more than 10 crates full of gold. Really? Of course. Hello? Well, if it isn't my little Choon-ja! Please, it's Haruko. You know I hate that name. Okay, Haruko. Hold on. Come on in. You're glowing. Seeing someone these days? Not with money bragging sly guys coming to the bar. How's the business there? It used to be packed but not so much these days. Why's that? They're all gone to the Southeast front line. Did you get what I asked for? Of course. It wasn't easy. But why are you in such a hurry to get a pass? I'll tell you when I get back. Attention! Independence! At ease! Is there a mission or not? - There is. - Really? Get rid of the Chief of State, And seize the 'Light of the East'. What? Two jobs at once? That's insane! This is why young folks these days don'tjoin the independence army. The Buddha statue at Seokguram had a diamond this big on the forehead. It was the light to shine our nation to the world. But the Japs are planning to take it away! Damn bastards! Damn it! Chief KIM Koo is fuming mad! So he ordered us to get it back! Can't we just steal the diamond and kill the man next time? But he's going back to Japan in 2 days! It's our only chance! But the operation should have some flexibility. That ain't right. Attention! Who are we? The only men of the independence troops' action corps in Seoul! Right. Fool... - Your dad was in the Liberation army. - So? He must be a region chief by now, huh? No, he's still a henchman. Really? He's been a henchman for long... Who cares if you're a henchman or the boss in the independence army. The chief said we're the light and hope of our people, regardless. Didn't he? That's right! The light and hope! That sounds nice! So, is there a plan? There is This is the banquet hall. You infiltrate in this way and scurry on down to here. And at exactly 9 pm, you blow the fuse box. I'll shoot the chief during the commotion. Then I'll steal the diamond and run away in the dark. They can't do a thing to stop us! Sounds too easy. You got it! Just go here and pull the lever down. Everything ready? It will be a lavish banquet with airtight security. Everything's ready, sir. Good. It will be quite a show. I gained the 'Light of the East' in this war. What did you gain? I gained the honor of serving you, sir. Can I count on you? Yes, sir! Do you believe in Japan's victory? Yes, sir! This war will end in Japan's defeat. Massive bombs have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The emperor will surrender soon. It's all over. Japan has lost this war. It's not the Chamber of Commerce year end bash in Tokyo, but it's nice. Come to parties like this often, sir? All too many to count. But I don't always have the honor of escorting a beautiful woman like you. I'll take that as a compliment. Haruko! - Someone you know? - No. Shall we? Good evening. Find anything on Kanemura? He's known as Kanemura Junichi a wealthy businessman from Osaka. Rumor has it he has strong connections in the military. - Find out more. - Yes, sir! What magic will you show me, tonight? It's a secret. It's a big surprise. I'd better prepare for my show. I'll see you later. If I was a man... I'd strap a gun on, And go out to fight for our country! On this glorious day! If only I was a man! If only I was a man! I should start by killing her. An honorable calling... - Good luck. - Just go! Going out to the battlefield with guns and swords... Man's dire wish... Is it this way? I think it's that way. Stirring the town through and through In excitement! Matsui Hideo! You are our heart and pride! A man born in Gae-sung, Korea! Twenty-one year old Matsui Hideo! Our very own proud kamikaze! Haruko? Sir Kanemura? You're Haedanghwa? This is preparing for a show? This was your big surprise? Hand it over. Damn it. You're so dead. Alright! This can't be happening... Where were you? The song already started. # Everlasting light # Our hope # Now in your arms # It is able to shine # Everlasting road # Our hope # The road to happiness # My heart is overjoyed. # Across the sea to the high sun and blue skies # It will go and silently become one in heart # It will be forever # It will be forever # To the burning sun # As we firmly pledged # The way we were then # And we are now, forever # It will be forever # It will be forever # To the burning sun # As we firmly pledged # The way we were then # And we are now, forever With great war tactics and decisive actions, He accomplished a monumental work in ruling the peninsula. May the roads be smooth ahead on the Chief of State's return home. Under the Chief of State's command... Haruko! Sir Yamada! Is that all you can wear? Excuse me? I thought you only sold your songs. But you sell your body, too? Sir Yamada! Were you such a degraded lady? Why must I listen to such words from you colonel? Fine, I'm a degraded and filthy woman. Happy? But I thought you'd... I shall never sing again. Now, the 'Light of the East' will... Go to the Emperor of Japan and shine as a beacon to the world! It's Haedanghwa! Get him! Nobody move! Hee-bong... He's so dead! Fire! - Don't move! - Stop! 'Light of the East' Stolen! Damn... Some independence trooper... How embarrassing. Instead of doing our mission, we start a fire... There were fuse boxes everywhere. I didn't know which one to cut. I'm sorry, sir. Forget it, kid. No need for independence troopers to apologize to each other. Damn it. We've blocked off all the railroads and streets out of Seoul. That'll do. The chief of police will take the case. Let me handle it, sir. Soldiers go to war while the police maintains public order. That is the law of the great Japanese empire. This is military police jurisdiction. I'll see to it being solved, sir. This dog never failed me. That's why he's still alive. I pledge my allegiance, sir. That won't be enough. I searched for the 'Light of the East' for over 20 years. It's all I have. I'll find it even if it costs me my life. I'll be watching... To see if a second class like you has what it takes to be first class. Yes, sir! The 'Light of the East' can be stolen but not sold! There is no fool on this land who'd buy it! Go keep a tight rein on all trains and roads out of the city! Yes, sir! The chief of police must report on everyone who came to the banquet and... We were ordered to consult together in running this case. No need to consult. I'm heading this. No, I am. Soldiers to war and the police to public affairs. That is the law of the empire. With no battles, now you want to do my job? Act like an officer of the great Japanese empire. - Inspector Hasekawa! - Yes, sir! Report on the case. Different from Haedanghwa's past robberies, There appears to be an accomplice and... Stop Hasekawa! Continue Hasekawa! Make your report! The only one to leave the banquet was... Sit down, Hasekawa! Who told you to sit down! I'm your superior! I won't stand you overriding my authority. What will you do? I'll arrest you for going against the empire's administrative order. A Korean dares arrest me? Changing your name won't make you a citizen of the emperor chief Suzimura! What are you talking about! Act like the mere Korean you are! HWANG Choon-duk! If you were trained as the hunting dog by the empire, Then go out and fetch the quarry! That's the only way a third class like you can come up to second. And don't forget. No one remembers a third class dog. Come back here, Hasekawa! No need to raise your voice, chief Hwang. We're compatriots. OH Duk-sool! - Continue reporting. - Yes, sir. We suspect Haruko to be Haedanghwa's accomplice. We will bring her in to help catch the real thief and... Who did you just say? Haruko... She's not that kind of lady. If you dare speak of her again with that filthy mouth of yours, I'll have your head! - Understood? - Yes, sir! She suddenly quit and disappeared. Did she mention anything? She said she'll never sing again. Haruko! Haruko! Where is that bitch! - Sir Kanemura! - Get out! - The bitch... - Sir Kanemura. She's not here, sir. You gotta believe me. She quit. Oh, really? She's really asking for it! I know she's here! Haruko! How dare you betray me! Come out while you still can! Haruko! Sir Kanemura, please calm down and... You're with her, aren't you! Where is she! Hand her over right now! Koreans putting up, something like that... What a phony suck up show! I'm sorry, sir. Sir Kanemura! Sir Kanemura! Sir Kanemura... Please, not this. Our lives are on the line! That is the symbol of the great Japanese empire! Great what? Whatever, you bastards! How dare you mock the flag of the empire! Why are you looking for Haruko! What is your relationship with her! You! Do you know who I am? You... Ouch! You stupid imbecile! I'll ask you again. Do you know who I am? Must I know? Sir Yamada! I'm a colonel in the empire's military police. Regardless of who you are, you'll be punished for mocking our flag. So... You think you can kill me? Let's put the sword away, shall we? Are you okay? Banquet Hall Liberated Korea Forever! KIM Koo Haruko! Where is she! Guess, not here. Going to Russia and opening up a jazz bar. She won't be able to sell it in Korea so... Russia. Chief KIM Koo doesn't recognize us, Instead we get a medal from the Japs. Yeah, when will we get to do something real for independence. For Christ's sakes! We should be on the front line all the time. But what about the bar? We need to make a living. You sell liquor to fund the troops. Sir! Do you think Chief KIM knows how hard we're working here? Why? It's not that I expect to get anything. But if no one knows how hard we're working for independence, What's the use? Don't worry. We land this operation and Chief Kim will give us a medal! What? Another mission? It's nothing big. We have to blow up the military train. What? They expect us to blow up a whole train ourselves! Calm down, kid! No! I'm not doing it! Fine! Don't! I'll just report to the chief you wouldn't do it. No! You can't! We do what we're told to do! You know why I'm fighting for independence, right? Of course. Fine, then. So what's the plan? Who needs a plan? Just go there and blow it up. Sounds easy enough. When do we go? - Now. - Now? Then let's go. - Everything's ready. - Okay. Over here! - Right here? - Yup. - It'll choo-choo on over soon. - They're so dead. It's backwards, fool. Really? They're so dead. Going to Russia, the home ofjazz? You have me mistaken for someone else, sir. Stay in your seat, ma'am. Give me the diamond and I'll let you go to Russia. Your secret identity will be safe with me. What diamond? I guess you won't be going to Russia this time. It's coming! Okay. - Put it in. - Okay. Hold tight. Stop shaking it. Ready? What are you doing? Running late on something? Shh! Wait. What are we going to do! It won't fit! Does this thing get bigger the more you touch it, too? The train will choo-choo past here! Did you bring a spare? What? I'm the shooter! Your job's to get the shells ready! You ain't yellin' at me, fool! You should've got 'em still! Some independence trooper! You idiot! Why are you yelling at me for! You're older and higher ranked! You should've prepared everything! Ten! Nine! Seven! Six! The train's coming! No time to blame anyone! Three! We're through! Bloody hell! One! Oh, no! Did you do that? I think I did. This hand's a miracle. It's this one. This one? There was an explosion on track 36. 50 cannons, 600 machine guns, and bombs heading for Manchuria have been stopped. The repair crew is currently... The war is over, colonel. If the supplies are late, our forces will... Yamada! There is no army. You're an officer of a defeated nation. Not only that, you're a Korean. But I'm... A Japanese down to by bones. Your spirit may be Japanese but your blood is Korean. No, sir! I'm... Colonel Yamada Shinjo of the Great Empire's forces! I know how you feel. If you find the 'Light of the East', I'll make sure you live better than a Japanese. Yes, sir! So? You're going to kill the Chief of State? The military is out everywhere after the track explosion. We could get ourselves killed! But we didn't blow up the train. But we blew up the tracks! We do exactly what we're told to do. That's the rule. That may be for you. But not for me. I won't live and die on command. I'm no puppet! If they tell us die, we do it like a man. Forget it. Bottom line is, we have different philosophies on life. Philosophy? You didn't even go to school. Different philosophies. You're making fun of me? Fine! I was stupid not to study. What's it to you! It's the other way around, you idiot. You're stupid 'cuz you didn't study. Well, if you're so smart! Then why aren't you fighting for independence in the front line! Beats me. I was planning to go anyway! You go your way! You have to be ready to give your life! You're no independence trooper! Fine! Let's split right now! I have my own thoughts and ways on independence! Fine! I'll tell the chief you didn't even go to school! - Fine! Then we're enemies! - Fine! Look, Haruko. Since we're both Koreans, let me call you Choon-ja. No. Call me Haruko. Choon-ja is so old-fashioned. And I'm not a Korean. You don't become a Japanese by denying you're Korean. I'm not Japanese, either. Let's cut the chit chat, Choon-ja. Please return the 'Light of the East' for our country's sake. Why should I? All I need is the money. Choon-ja. I'm in the independence army. I am the head of the Korean secret intelligence. If you give me the diamond, I'll make sure you're rewarded for your act of patriotism. You have my word of honor. Then I can be a part of the independence movement? Yes, Choon-ja. You, too, are now... A proud member of the independence army. You con-man freak! Ow, that hurts. What does Haruko's father do? Her parents passed away when she was young. I'm not sure on the details. This is the problem with Koreans. You don't listen when I ask nicely. I really don't know anything, sir. I received a Good Citizen's Award. I wouldn't lie. Let's see... Why are your answers always the same? Right or wrong! Yes or no! Just say what I want from you! But, sir. But... Wait! Please! Hold on... I remember... I remember now. The pawnshop. Try there. Pawnshop? Yes, sir. She'd borrow accessories from there before her shows. The owner there will tell you where she might be. It's the truth. Did you know I was trained in torturing? Shall I free your fingers with this? Or liberate your eyeballs with this? This should do for you. Pretty small, isn't it? Know what this is? Imagine. This digging under your nails one by one. Where's the diamond? Where is it! Damn it! Getting beat up and fainting. Stop talking about the Japs. I took the beating for a greater purpose. You're fighting for independence to live as a Korean. But me! I'm fighting to die as a Korean! This is exactly why we're different! You have to live long to fight for independence! You can take living long under the Japs? That's not what I meant! Let's drop it. I don't want to argue with you. But going to kill the Chief of State is a suicide! We didn't get any orders to kill him! Stop acting commando! Then what are we really doing as independence troopers, huh? It is our duty to sacrifice our lives for the movement! Stop it! Okay, okay. Bring in 100 men from those who refused to adopt Japanese names. And gather them in the back field. What's the plan? They'll be executed for condoning Haedanghwa. What? If Haedanghwa doesn't bring the diamond back even after that, Then kill all 100! That's going a little too far. If he doesn't show even then, kill 100 more! Whether it takes thousands, kill until the diamond is found! But it's not an easy matter to... Mutiny will be handled by the army! Even if we have to kill all the Koreans! We will find the 'Light of the East'! August 15th, 1945 Get me a pass to China, Russia, or anywhere! I got you one last time. You're like a father to me. I think of you as a daughter, too. But... Can I call you father from now on? A father who can't even get his daughter a pass... I'll miss you so much when I'm in Russia. There's one left here somewhere... What the! Long time no see. Looks like business is good. Thank you. This won't work in catching Haedanghwa. Whatever happened to scientific investigations? Hands out of your pockets! Come on, we're compatriots. Where are you going? To catch Haedanghwa, where else? Let me go! The 'Light of the East' is not for one person to have. I'll give you $200 for it. I might reconsider for $500. Fine, $500. Done deal. Put the gun down. Excuse me? I hate to interrupt you, two. Let's get rid of this guy first. Fine by me. Use profits forjustice and dedicate your life to good. But your greed erased any righteousness. Hope you come back a better man in your next life. Wait! Lushun Prison. Serve thy country by using profits for justice and dedicating life to do good. Dr. AHN Joong-geun's last words before his execution at Lushun Prison, right? And you still sold off our cultural goods! Damn, not the face... It's in the 'History of Righteous Clan' course. How do you know that? And you call yourself an independence trooper. I'm in the movement. I'm OH Bong-gu, leader of the third secret intelligence. I'm #13 of Mt. Baekdu! That's right. Think you can con me, now? You're history! We fight for Korea's absolute freedom! Our nation is our father and our people is our mother! Secret intelligence is the root of all strategies! # Live and become a warrior of independence. # Die and become the soul of the movement. # Let's all go out and fight! # Till the bell of freedom rings! # Let's fight to the end! # Fight together to the end! You're the legendary #37, right? Damn it... We don't even know each other's faces in the secret army. Ouch! Not too rough. Well, have fun catching up. I'll be going. Her gun's not loaded. She took it from my house. Yeah, right. Higher! If Haedanghwa returns with the 'Light of the East', you'll live. If not, you will all be executed at noon today. Enjoy the grace of the Great Japanese Empire until then. I'm taking it to headquarters. Do you even know the way? It was my duty to get the 'Light of the East'. I gave orders to kill the Chief of State too but the fools started a fire. I'm the one who should take it back. Secret intelligence put me to the job. Sorry, comrade. Until I check with the base, I can't trust you 100% yet. What? You don't trust me? Fine, let's go together. Happy, comrade? But I'm taking the diamond, agreed, comrade? I'm coming, too. What? Come on. Let's all just split it in three. It belongs to the nation! The fate of our people is in... My dad's Korean and my mom's Japanese. In Japan, they call me a smelly Korean. In Korea, they think I'm dirty with mixed Japanese blood. Independence or not. I'm leaving this place. I couldn't care less about either country. So let's just split it. And people think Haedanghwa's a regular Robin Hood. Robin Hood loved riches, too. So you don't trust me? You want to take it yourself? Fine. Then you take it. It can't be opened unless you break it. Happy? What are you doing? We can't leave a trace. Let's just take her. I'll set up thatjazz bar for you when we get to Russia. Meeting's over? There's a report of a gun shot down the street. A gun shot? - Send the squad! - Yes, sir! Look at all that blood. It hurts to be shot, doesn't it? Who do we have here? Haruko! We meet again. Where's the diamond? Don't tell me. You'll spoil the fun. Wanna know what I'll do with you? First, I'll pluck out all yourjoints! Then strike needles under your nails! You bastard! How dare you! What are you looking at! How dare you... What? Oh, I get it! You're all in the independence army! Haedanghwa and rebel troops on top! At this rate, I'll become the chief of police! Hurray for OH Duk-sool! Liberated Korea Forever! This is what you do, huh? That traitor! Open fire! Come on! Come on! Stop shooting! I caught Haedanghwa! Thinks he can get away with a hostage! Fire! We're on the same side, idiots! I'm Hasekawa! You bunch of idiots! We're on the same side. Hurry up! I'm on your side... Ow! My ankle! Are you okay? Get up, soldier! A broken ankle can't keep you down! Go ahead without me. No! Get up! You can go! Hurry up and go! What if we lose the 'Light of the East' again? But what about you? I can't run like this. #13 of Mt. Baekdu! It's not a bad way to go. Don't you think? In a liberated Korea! In a liberated Korea! Be quiet or you'll get caught! What? What's going on? Hee-bong? Where'd he go? Dear honorable sir, The kid wrote me an apology note. Dear honorable sir, I hope I find you in good health. Blame it on our different philosophies on life. Smart folks like you should live... For a brighter future for our country. It's my time, sir. Please forgive me for going first. Please tell the chief that even stupid fools like me died for independence! From, Bong. Hee-bong! Out of my way! Move! At ease! You're Haedanghwa? If I give you the diamond, will you release the people? You have my word. Okay. I'll agree to your terms. She was with Duk-sool the traitor. Two soldiers who were also there are missing. We brought her in for questioning. Go! Take charge at the field. Kill them all at noon! Why do you have this? Haedanghwa gave you this, and he has the diamond! Tell me who gave you this! Is it Kanemura? Answer me! Why can't you answer me! Why! There was a call from Haedanghwa? Yes. He wanted 10 crates of gold in exchange for the 'Light of the East'. And also a girl called, Haruko. Shouldn't we verify him before... Just do the job you're told to do. Yes, sir. Act quickly. You must get there before noon. The 'Light of the East' is worth this much? That diamond is worth more than all this gold? It's worth a lot more than just that. Hurry, Yamada! Sir Yamada! Please! Yes, sir! Good work. Ready to go... The front gates? Only a few guards, sir. Move in secret! Go! Yes, sir! Stop! Who are you? Kill him! Yes, sir! Kill him! Bastard! Liberated Korea forever! Aye or Nay? Aye! What? Stop! Stupid dog! Kanemura! So it was you! Where are the goods? Where's the 'Light of the East? ' Are you okay? What are you doing? We had a deal. Ready! In consideration of the general world affairs, To save the situation at hand, I announce my decision to accept... The terms of the allied forces... It's an announcement of defeat! Japan has surrendered! Liberated Korea forever! Liberated Korea forever! No! God, no! Why'd you come out here? Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Why! Why! Why! Stop hitting me. What? I'm alive? Sir! Hold on. I'll get you to a hospital, soon. Where's my diamond? How can you ask me that at a time like this? You lost it, didn't you! You believe in the 'Light of the East'? There is no such thing. The diamond is a fake. Send 'Light of the East' to homeland No one wants to lose something like that. A diamond ordered to be sent home, disappears... What choice did he have? Of course he agreed to my terms. Get gold for a fake diamond then use that to get more gold. Use the gold to fund the army to take back our gold going to Japan. The most heroic mission of the century! Cool, aren't I? Yeah, right! Give me my diamond back! Where is it! Where'd you hide it! Choon-ja! - I want my diamond! - Stop it, will you! Where is it! Give me my diamond back! Where'd you hide it! And so came liberation from Japan. The gold was used to help rebuild the country. And our accomplishments became a legend. Anyway... I wonder if there's anything else as fun to do. Japanese and Dogs Restricted That rotten son of a... I should've killed him before the war ended. Go ahead. - Huh? - Kill him. Hi, baby! There are over 6000 acres in Kyunggi-do alone without land rights. So? There's no cadastral at all! Over 100 people are fighting to claim rights to the land. So? Let's make a cadastral and take all the land. I told you, I'm not a crook. I need the money to get out of here. Where are you planning on leaving me for? America! New Orleans! Home ofjazz. Didn't you say it was Russia before? And you don't sing jazz. It's old folk! You make the cadastral. And I'll sneak it into the right place. Or give me back my gold. Why should you get all the gold and a medal? Just go and sing. We'll talk later. Things changed a lot around here. Heard anything? About what? Nothing? What? No new mission? Stupid, the war's over. There's no mission. Get back to the kitchen! A hero doesn't belong in the kitchen. I want to live like a hero, now! Heroes have to eat, too, you fool! Heroes don't eat! So there! You look like you've starved your whole life! Now, get back to work! Choon-ja's on!
