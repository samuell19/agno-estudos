(dramatic music) (slow suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (slow suspenseful music) (uptempo suspenseful music) (buzzer ringing) (buzzer ringing) (buzzer ringing) (buzzer ringing) (suspenseful music) Good morning, Daddy. What took you so long, Victoria? You heard my buzzer. Unless, you're deaf. Now, Daddy, relax. You mustn't get yourself excited. You know what Dr. Cooper said. Dr. Cooper. (scoffs) Thinks he's the world's greatest doctor. If he treats all his patients like this, my clinic's finished. He'll be here in about an hour. Now, quit your grumbling. You're not fooling anyone. You know perfectly well Dr. Cooper's an excellent doctor. Eh. I should think you'd be grateful. He saved your life. Saved my life? Any two-year med student could have diagnosed my condition. Will you stop your fussing and eat? You probably poisoned it. Daddy. Don't Daddy me. I could choke to death on my coffee, and you wouldn't shed a tear. Now, Daddy, you must relax. We don't wanna make Dr. Cooper unhappy. You've been after Craig Cooper for years and he won't give you a tumble. (laughing) One of the few pleasure I have left in life is watching you trying to sink your hooks into him. Papa, dear, eat your breakfast before it gets cold. (sighing) She can't ruin applesauce. [Woman Off-Screen] Craig! I'm up, I'm up. [Woman Off-Screen] Sweetheart! Craig, come on, wake up, darling. I'll be there in five minutes. (water splashing) I've got something for you. I'll be there in four minutes. Sweetheart, are you up? Come on, Craig. Come on, sweetheart, rise and shine. Every time I look at you, I rise and shine. Mm. Mm. Mm, sweet. You know what? What? I've got a proposition for you. I'm always ready. If you'll scrub my back, I'll scrub yours. (Craig laughing) Yeah, that sounds pretty interesting. As a matter of fact, I'm tingling with great expectations. (telephone ringing) Wait a minute, I'll be right back. (telephone ringing) Don't move, I'll be right back. (telephone ringing) Hello? (laughing) Yeah, I'm up, I'm up. Now, where were we? I don't know. Where were you? I think I was about right here. Mm. (giggling) Right. (sighs) Craig? Hm? Can I be serious with you for a moment? Oh, come off it, honey. It's 7:30 in the morning. Here, your turn. I'm gonna welsh on my end of the deal unless you listen to me for a moment. (telephone ringing) Ah, saved by the bell. (telephone ringing) Hello? Wait a minute. What's the idea of calling me here? Look, I thought we agreed not to contact each other again. I don't care if you do need the money. Listen, don't threaten me. Alright, I'll do What I can. Maybe a couple of hundred. (phone dialing) Hello, Dr. Cooper here. Right, I'll be at the clinic from 8:30 until 9:30, at 10 o'clock at Dr. Waterman's. Okay, thank you. (rock music) Oh, hi. I was just getting my keys out of the pool, they fell in. Oh, wow. Uh. I've heard of people like you. Oh, wow. Oh, no. My mother wants me home by, mm. No. (doorbell ringing) I didn't see Miss Turner's car in the driveway. She's not here. Victoria, I thought I told you that I wanted a nurse with your father around the clock. I'm here, what's the fuss? I wish to hell you'd listen to me once in a while, Victoria. I don't have to tell you. Breathe deep and exhale. I've been waiting for two weeks. Breathe. Hell, I own that clinic. And when I ask for the results of my own cardiogram, I expect, Ridgeley, you're the patient. I'm the doctor, remember? Now, the clinic is following my orders. For how long? That's what I'm here to find out. Well, since you're being so agreeable, but thank you, Vicky, that's fine. I like caring for you, Daddy. I'm not completely helpless. I think Victoria wants to become a nurse. She'd make a lousy nurse. As good as Nurse Turner. Well, I keep her around for laughs. I want that comedian by your side at all times. Have Miss Turner call me tomorrow. Okay. What the hell am I supposed to do all day? Stare into space? I'll see you tomorrow. Craig. Yeah, Doc, I know. Take care. You do have a way with him. He was almost apologetic. Your father and I are very close. He's been very good to me. I know. You had a hard time in med school, didn't you? I managed. Care for a drink? I can't. Why can't you? It's very early and I have a very busy day ahead of me. What makes you so hard to get? Are you trying to get me, Victoria? [Cheryl] Hi. Hi. [Cheryl] You're home early. Yeah, I got finished sooner than I expected. I had feeling you'd be here. (Cheryl moans) [Cheryl] I let myself in. I hope you don't mind. [Craig] When did I ever mind? [Cheryl] I've got steaks on the broiler, a salad on the table. (lips smacking) Do you mind if I take your tie off? [Craig] Mmm mm.. [Cheryl] You look so tired. [Craig] That's better. [Cheryl] Mm. [Craig] Mm, this is nice, huh? [Cheryl] Very nice. [Craig] Mm. Come here, a little closer. [Cheryl] (laughing) I can't get any closer. [Craig] Mhm, yes you can. (doorbell ringing) Damn. [Cheryl] Somebody up there is pushing all the wrong damn buttons. Well, hello old buddy. Well, how are you? What are you doing here? I just stopped by to have a little chat with you. Say, now this is some pad. L dig it. Well, aren't you gonna introduce us, Doc? Cheryl, this is Mr. Mills. You wanna excuse, honey? We have some business to discuss. Of course, I'll go change. It's a nice girl you got there, Doc. And she cares. But, I wonder if she cares enough to come visit you in prison for the next 10 years, hm? Larry, just exactly what is it that you want? Well, the same things you do, Doc. Respectability and freedom. Now, that is the big one, Doc. Freedom. [Craig] Well, you're free to go out and find it. [Larry] No, no, no, your freedom, not mine. [Craig] Larry, I thought I told you I was through doing business with you. Hey, easy, old buddy. I just stopped by to tell you that I expect $50,000 in two weeks. [Craig] What the hell for? [Larry] For the privilege of not doing business with me anymore. You're crazy. No, I am not crazy, thank you. And you better think about it, Doc. What do you think a judge would say to Mrs. Bartlett's little tale of woo, hm? Or the Joy Hunter thing? Larry. You seem to be forgetting one little thing. You're just as deeply involved in this as I am. (laughing) No. I'm clean, Doc. I only introduce you to the people that you do your thing to. You know, introductions are my specialty. So are photographs. I mean, I really appreciate (exhaling) and understand their full value. Hey, tell me something, Doc. What do you think that the District Attorney would give me to wangle an introduction to you, hm? What's that two dollar word, immunity? I don't have that kind of money. Well, I didn't expect you to have it in your pocket. But you got some big-time connections these days, Doc. I mean, you're no longer that middle class punk trying to brain your way out of the lower middle class. You've made it, Doc. You ain't got any style, though. But you made it. Good night, Doc. See you in two weeks. Craig? What kind of trouble costs $50,000? You were listening? Yes. Abortion. Abortion? I didn't know you did abortions. I don't. Not now. How did you get involved? Med school. I needed the money. Wow. You can get in a lot of trouble doing that. (sighs) I know. It can cost me my license, and my career. Don't let him scare you. Maybe he's bluffing. Uh uh, he's not bluffing. He'd chop me in a minute. I'd lose everything. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I gotta get that money, though. Someway, somehow. The roses are beautiful this morning, aren't they? Yes, they're lovely. But I don't think Daddy would appreciate them. Well, of course he does. He misses his rose bushes. Does he? Yes, he does. You're very, very sweet to my daddy, aren't you? Well, I try. I see you trying, Miss Innocence. Miss Innocence? Didn't you know? I'm listed in the Yellow Pages under 'Sex.' Your hair is really very pretty. Why don't you do something special with it? My hair's alright. I don't get paid because I look like Raquel Welch. (ceramic shattering) Clumsy. Would you be a good girl and clean it up for me? I'll take this up to Daddy. Bitch. Lunch, Daddy. See, I picked you some roses. Where's Miss Turner? She's coming. I need her. You haven't been following my orders, have you, Doctor? Been at the brandy? What's an aging shut-in to do? Good morning, Dr. Cooper. Dr. Waterman is to receive absolutely no stimulants whatsoever. I want him to receive at least 8 hours of good, sound sleep. Well, that kills our Late Late Show. I want you to go over to the hospital and pick this up. It's not in general distribution yet. I'll guard it with my life, Doctor. Try not to miss me too terribly while I'm gone. (chuckles) Damn fool. Be good, now, Doctor. What's my alternative? Craig, don't leave. I want to talk to you. Buzz me if you need me, Daddy? D'accord [Victoria] Like it? (laughing) Like? It's overpowering. I didn't know you could be overpowered. You know, you've become quite an artist. Painted up a storm. Therapy, Doctor, therapy. Are you really having trouble with your income tax? Yes. You owe them a lot? I'm not too sure, yet. Look, if you need some money, I've got some. Well, that's very nice of you, but I can manage. I'd love to help you in some way. Victoria, thank you for showing me your work, but I've got to go. You didn't know how talented I was, did you? Victoria, I've got to go. (suspenseful music) (whimsical music) (wind chimes chiming) [Craig] Victoria, we're very young souls. Very young and evil. [Victoria] Yes, very evil. [Craig] We've got a lot to get out of this lifetime. We may not get another chance. [Victoria] You'll probably live to be 110. Yeah? Why's that? Only the good die young. (laughs) Yeah, well, if you keep sniffing that stuff, you're not gonna live very long, either. But what a way to go. Except for the headaches after. No, seriously. Amyl nitrite, that's pretty potent stuff. As a matter of fact, if you have a heart condition, it can kill you. Kill you? Yeah. That's one of the reasons they put it on prescription. What's bothering you? Moment of truth? Mhm. I need 50,000. Dollars? Dollars. Why? Oh, let's call it a tax problem. I don't have that kind of money. But, I know how to get it. How? Never mind. I'll get it. Soon? Soon. (Craig sighing) I fixed you a drink. I hope you like bourbon. Please, sit down. I guess you're wondering why I asked you to come over. Oh, I hope I didn't sound too mysterious. I want to talk to you about Craig. Alright, what about him? You don't know how hard he's worked to get where he has, and what you're doing can ruin him. (laughing) That's right, I could ruin him. But, why? What has he done to you? Oh, I got 50,000 Why'S. He can get it. [Cheryl] No, he can't. Yeah, he can. People can and will do a lot of things when they have to. There's nothing that will change your mind? Alright, you wanna help him? [Cheryl] If I can. Stand up. (sighs) Will you leave him alone? Are you gonna stand up? (seductive music) Will you leave Craig alone? (exhales) You have my word. (screaming) (uptempo rock music) (yelling) (uptempo rock music) Please, please! (sighing) (lips smacking) Well, thanks for the turn, baby. But, no deposits. You're good, but not that good. (eerie music) (dramatic music) The look on his face. He didn't wanna live. Not that way. Well, at least he died with dignity. Where's Victoria? Downstairs, Doctor. Victoria? Are you alright? I'm fine. You saw him? Yes. Did he have much pain? A certain amount is usual in this kind of death. I didn't want him to have any pain. I knew there'd be no headache. I didn't want him to suffer. He just, sort of, stiffened. I did it for you, Craig. For me? He was going to die, anyway. Victoria, that was your father. Don't look at me like that? How in the hell do you want me to look at you? What are you doing? Calling the police. Go ahead. And what are you going to do about your tax problem? Sell shoes? Dr. Cooper, Mr. Remington of the coroner's office is on the telephone. Hello, Mr. Remington. No, I didn't expect it. Yes. I'll be down tomorrow to sign the papers. Cause of death? Stroke. [Lawyer] It's a simple matter, Victoria. Your father left everything in order for me. Mr. Jacobson, what has to be done now? First of all, we have to set a date for the reading of the will. Is that necessary? Your father stipulated that there'd be. I see. When? How's the 26th? That's two weeks from tomorrow. Does it have to take that long? I just wanna get it over with. My firm needs the time, and your father left instructions to the effect that I notify your younger sister before the reading of the will. [Victoria] Gail? (laughs) She hasn't been home in over seven years. I don't even know where she's living. Well, don't worry, we'll handle the notification. We have her address in New York and we can get it out tonight. Victoria, let us say two weeks from tomorrow, 10 am. Is that alright? Yes. Okay, I think that's enough business for today. I'll let myself out, and good day, Victoria. [Victoria] Welcome home, Gail. Oh, and you must be Kate. It's been a long time. [Gail] Yes, a long time. [Victoria] How was the plane ride? [Gail] Oh, bumpy. See, Gail? Everything's just as it was. It's beautiful. Gail, I'd like you to meet Dr. Cooper, our family physician. Hello, Gail. Miss Kate Lucas. How do you do? Hello. Would someone care for some coffee? I'd love some. Excuse me. Please, sit down. Thank you. Welcome home. Thank you. Dr. Waterman spoke often of you. He missed you. Oh. Well, he'd been failing for some time. I didn't know. He died in his sleep. He had very little pain. Coffee will be ready in about five minutes. Oh, I've gotta get back to the clinic right away. Well, you'll be joining us for dinner later on, then, won't you? Of course. I'll see you out. Okay. If you'll excuse me. It was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, too, Doctor. And, don't make any plans for after dinner. You were pretty tough on Gail tonight. As a matter of fact, I think you handled the whole matter very badly. I thought it was a rather pleasant dinner. I wasn't talking about dinner and you know it. Yes. (lips smacking) I know. $50,000, my sweet. $50,0000. As soon as the will is probated, and Daddy's business affairs are in perfect order. 10 days to two weeks. I'll get the money back to you, I swear it. Don't swear. Please don't swear. I don't want the money. I have you. And make no mistake about it, I do have you. You are a bitch. Come here, bitch. (slow rock music) "Second, I direct my executor to pay my just debts "and expenses of last illness, funeral and burial, "as soon after my death, as is convenient. "It is my intention to hereby dispose "of all real and personal property, "which I have the right to dispose of by will, "including any and all property as to which I may have "the power of appointment by will." Miss Turner. Yes? "To my nurse, Emily Turner. "I bequeath the sum of $1,500 for service rendered, "and for giving me those needed laughs. "To Dr. Craig Cooper, I have established a trust fund. "The proceeds, which are not to exceed $10,000 per annum, "and which must be spent on medical research. "I wish to make public this acknowledgement of your skills "as a man of medicine. "Now, then, "I give, devise and bequeath the remainder of my estate, "real, personal or mixed, "of every kind kind and nature, "and wheresoever situated, "of which I may die, ceased or possessed, "or to which I may be entitled at the time of my death, "to my daughter, "Gail Waterman." There is a codicil to the will which states the following: "I hereby declare that my other daughter, Victoria Waterman, "is to receive exclusive privileges to this house, "sufficient funds for its maintenance, "plus an additional personal allowance of $250 a week, "for as long as she may live. "The home will continue to be owned by the estate, "but it cannot be liquidated during the course "of my daughter Victoria's lifetime." No, no. [Craig] Victoria. He can't do this to me. I was the one who took care of him when he was sick. I took care of him. I lived with him all these years, not her. I took all the insults. You don't know what I went through. Mine. It's rightfully mine! [Craig] Victoria, you're getting hysterical. Shut up! Leave me alone! You. It's always been you! You didn't care for him, not the way I did! Why did you have to come back? I hate you! I hate you! (yelling) It's mine, it's so unfair! Shh. (Victoria yelling) No, I don't, (screaming) (screaming) (sobbing) Why, Craig? It's alright. Glad I did it. Be quiet. I'm glad I killed him. Shut up! Somebody might walk in. But I'd do it again, only this time, I wouldn't make it so easy for him. (moaning) [Craig] Shh. It looks like you're back on salary again. Yes, Doctor. I understand. Continue the sedation. Call me if you need me. I don't care what time it is. If you leave this room for any reason, lock the door after you. Will do, Doctor. Oh, Doctor! May I speak to you for a moment? Of course. I'm concerned about Gail. I mean, that little scene Victoria put on for us today. I'm sure that won't happen again. Oh? And, why is Victoria confined to her room? She's sedated. I didn't want her wandering about. I was afraid of the stairs. I don't buy it, Doctor. I wasn't aware that I was selling anything, Miss Lucas. Look, Doctor, Victoria's a little sicker than anyone cares to admit, isn't she? I appreciate your concern, but I have a busy day, so, if you'll excuse me. The hell with your busy day, Doctor. I'm concerned about Gail's safety. Our relationship goes back a long time. Your relationship? I've been around. Around long enough to know that there's something going on between you and Victoria. You've got a vivid imagination, Miss Lucas. Why don't you try your hand at writing? Maybe I will. Maybe I'll write a book about a young, ambitious doctor who makes a big play for a young heiress, even though she's a little nutty, and then he finds out that she's not going to inherit the money, but that her younger sister is, so he starts to make a play for her younger sister. Stay away from Gail. Jealous? She listens to me, Doctor. Only me, remember that. It won't do you a damn bit of good using your bedside manner on her. We'll see. Kate? What are we gonna do with all that money? Well, you don't have your own yacht. There's lots of things you can buy. Good morning! Good morning, Miss Turner. Isn't it funny what a new day will bring? Yesterday, I was broke, today, I'm an heiress. (laughs) Anyone for a hot game of Scrabble? Tennis? Karate? Are you alright, Gail? Sure, I'm fine. You know, I'm gonna blow my inheritance. I'm gonna buy me a whole new wardrobe, all kinds of bright colors, anything but white. If you knew how I hate white, ugh. (Gail laughing) Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning. How's the Dragon Lady this morning? Kate. Victoria's fine. She's asleep right now. We'll continue like this for the next day or so, Miss Turner. I'm sure she'll be alright. But she's not eating, Doctor. Oh, I think she'll come around. If she doesn't, we'll just have to take the necessary steps. Like what, Doctor? She might have to go to a hospital where she'd receive complete care. Complete care? Why does Victoria have to go to the hospital, Doctor? All I meant was that she needs absolute quiet. Like a hospital. Isn't that what you said, Miss Turner? Well, yes, but I'm sure she's going to be alright. Well, this heiress has to get back to her chores. I'd almost forgotten how beautiful it is here. Yes, it is, and you should be enjoying the place more. You know, it would do you good to get out. Smog or no smog, we have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world here. That might be a good idea. Listen, I've got an idea. I've got two more house calls to make in the Canyon. Why don't you come with me? Well, I, Oh, come on, it'll do you good. Well, alright. Kate, why don't you join us? No, I'll stay here. Okay, let me get a sweater. (Renaissance music playing) (crowd murmuring) (soft instrumental music) (waves crashing) (abstract experimental music) (woman laughing) (water splashing) (Gail yelling) (Gail laughing) (Gail laughing) (soft seductive music) (dramatic music) (soft seductive music) (loud rock music) (soft seductive music) What are you doing? Packing. I've decided to leave. Leave? But, why? It's for the best. But I don't understand. Let me spell it out for you. (sighs) The kind of woman I am is a very lonely woman, and the only world I'm really comfortable in is with other women who are the same way. That's not for you. Sometimes, in my lonliest moments, But you never did anything. Of course not. I can't. And the way things are now. (sighs) Are you leaving tonight? Yes, I've already called a cab. Well, I think you'll live. Hi. How you feeling? I was hoping you'd come visit me. Not that I had any right to expect it. May we be alone? Oh, sure, Gail. I wish a man would ask me that. I guess tonight just isn't my night. Oh? Kate's leaving tonight. How come? She's going back to New York, I guess. I have to talk to you about something. Yes? It's about the will, I thought about it. I thought about nothing else for the last two days. I'm sorry about what I did. The will is not your fault. You didn't write it, he did. And he's dead. Really dead. He had quite a hold on us, didn't he? But, that's all over now. We'll work everything out ourselves. We'll work it out so that you get half of everything. I thought you'd make that offer. But, I don't want it. You don't want it? No. I don't want anything from him. But it won't be from him, it'll be from me. No, it wouldn't. It really wouldn't. Oh, Victoria, don't be so stubborn. Oh, I just can't seem to give my money away. Second time today. Second time? Let's see. Would it be Dr. Cooper and his trouble with, uh, Internal Revenue Service? Yes. And, he wouldn't take it from you? No. Sounds like he really likes you. Why do you say that? Well, that's not important. What is important is that we're together again. Victoria, will you let me do something for you? Will you let me take care of you until you get better? But I am better, much better. Well, you're almost better. I'll let Miss Turner go. Can I bring you anything from the kitchen? No. I'm a little tired, I think I'll take a nap. There you go. Sweet dreams. Gail? Yes? Don't lock the door, it's alright. Okay. (suspenseful music) Here are Victoria's keys. You're welcome to stay the night if you'd like. Oh, no, thank you. I haven't been in my apartment in days. The spiders must be having a ball. (laughs) Good night, Gail. Good night, Miss Turner. Thank you. (door lock clicking) (suspenseful music) (loud abstract music) (suspenseful music) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) Hello? Hello, who is this, Gail? Hello, Craig. Victoria, what are you doing up? Let me speak to Gail. She's not here. She went back to New York. That's impossible. Listen, what's going on over there? Victoria? (phone clicking) Victoria! (uptempo music) (suspenseful music) Where's Gail? She's gone. I don't believe you. Look for yourself. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (sobbing) Why? Why? (suspenseful music) Victoria? Do you know what I have to do? Don't answer the door. Don't pick up the phone. I'll be back as soon as I can. (screaming) (eerie music) (uptempo music)
