Listen. Listen. Do you hear? Again. Again. What's wrong with our son? He doesn't sleep, doesn't smile.. Mukul. Mukul, won't you sleep, Son? Everybody is sleeping, won't you sleep? l am drawing. - That's fine, draw in the morning. You will catch cold at night, Son. Get up. Mukul? - This is peacock. l have seen peacock. This is camel. We had camel in our house. This is my house. l am standing in front of my house. This is a war going on. l have seen war. And this is fort, golden fort. Since when did you notice this matter with him? lt's about two or three months now. Does this happens to him on some particular time? He remains lost almost all the time. As if his attention is somewhere else. l can't send him to school at all. He has no interest in studies. He sits thinking. And keeps drawing. On asking he says it's the picture of his birthplace. Have you seen all those? Fort, hills, camel..? - l was there. You remember when? And this war going on? Bows, arrows, swords? You have seen these also? - l have seen. Have you been in warfare? - l was small. And, when you grew up? l didn't grow up. What was your father, a king? - Someone else was king. And your father. l had a ring on my finger, like that. Ring? Like this? - l have seen stone. Stone? What stone? - Red, blue, yellow, many kinds. Precious stone? Very lustrous? - Lustrous. He is saying this newly these days. Where were the stones, at your house? - Yes, at house. You were rich? You people had a very big house? No, a small house. Where were the stones kept? lnside safe? Or buried in the earth? He doesn't remember everything. He remembers something at times and he says. Very interesting. ls he okay with Dr. Hajra taking him to Rajastan? Better ask him. Will you go with the doctor to Rajastan? l will see golden fort, with the doctor. Smile a little, child. - Why? Smile. Smile makes a very good photo. l don't feel like smiling. All these precious gemstones were stored.. ..in some secret place in Mukul's house. 'Hello?' 'Hello?' - Wait, man hello.. hello.. 'Hello?' 'Hello?!' - Yes l am Bose speaking. 'What's the matter?' - Did you read the newspaper today? 'ls this why you are calling me?' - Read it. 'What's there?' - At the bottom of last page. Very good opportunity. On investing a little, we could have huge income. 'What is the matter about?' - You read. l will call back after ten minutes. Okay? 'All right.' - And listen, don't say so much hello.. hello. Remember, this is public telephone. How long? Twenty minutes over. Wait, man. Being impatient in such matters is not right. Such a golden chance, wait, let's see for sometime. Take out the picture. Take out the picture. Forehead.. nose.. All right. Hair.. Turn this side, boy let me see. Oh no. Mukul, a kite fell down there, check. Check there. Child, can you say where is number seven Jotin Das lane? Number seven? That's Photik's house. Will you please show us, child? We are coming from Beluchistan. So we aren't so aware of Kolkata roads.. Come on. Mr. Prodosh Mitra..? - Come inside come. Be seated. l made him sit. You have to wait. - What? Three and a half minute. What is this?! Look at the boy! You'll chock yourself. Look, he left half the milk. Didn't even drink the lime juice. Phelu's client means his client as well. Does it makes any sense? Have to rush to Delhi or somewhere now. He belongs to restless dynasty. Say what to do? How restless have you been? - l am black sheep. Talk of elder brother and second brother. Second brother used to pick up fox pups from the fox's den. He was only ten years old then. Phelu is his son. l am not talking about Phelu. He chose it as a profession. But, my son has studies, has school. ls there a teacher like Phelu in that school? Greetings. - You..? Be seated. My name is Sudeep Dhar. l have a book store in college street. Oh. - Kailash Chowdhury from Shyampukur is my customer. l heard a lot of praises for you from him. No .Thank you. Tell me what the matter is? - The matter being.. Have you noticed this? Yes off course l noticed. So is Mukul Dhar your..? He is my son. Youngest son. He is a famous personality now. ls it true what he says? Does he really remember his previous life? Well, we don't understand so much. But, Dr. Hajra.. Dr. Hajra mean Hemango Hajra? Parapsychologist? He just returned from Canada? Yes, sir. l got acquainted with him at the store. lt says about going to Rajastan..? - Has gone. Has gone? - Yes. Yesterday morning, by Toofan express. They will halt in Delhi for a day, then go to Rajastan. Have they gone towards Jodhpur? - Yes.. yes, sir. You are right. - Jodhpur is obvious. As he said about sand and fort both, ..then it seems to be western Rajastan. Yes, sir. Dr. Hajra too said the same thing. He said, l am doing research on rebirth, let him go with me. lf he could recognize his place properly.. ..then many things will get revealed. Well you have a business of books. Don't you have book with pictures of Rajastan at home? Or you ever had? lt could be possible that he is drawing the pictures.. ..after seeing the pictures in the book. And he made up the story of previous birth. Children get strange ideas many times you know. l do understand. But, drawing in the middle off night.. Middle of night? - At two, two thirty or three. And in these winter nights. And he doesn't even know Dr. Hajra. But, as soon as he said of showing golden fort.. ..he agreed to go with him instantly. The boy doesn't want to go anywhere.. ..without parents even for one day. And he didn't even look back at us. To say honestly, for a few months now.. ..he seems to be a stranger to us. He was not like this earlier you know. He was quite jolly, used to play and enjoy.. Your son has changed, is this your problem? Because.. - No.. no, sir! Not at all.. not at all. Problem.. the problem is that l couldn't sleep at all last night. ls that because of the hidden treasure? Yes, you are right. And the disaster happened.. ..after putting it in the newspaper. But, your son has said about hidden treasure. He has said about precious stones and all. He said that those were in his own house. But, the pictures that he draws, those seem to be ordinary houses. Fine. Now the matter is, there is a boy of my son's age.. ..in our locality, his name too is Mukul. Some people picked up that boy away last evening. You mean kidnap? - Yes, kidnap. From the locality? - Yes from the locality. And they dropped him back at dawn today. You are afraid that they have realized their mistake.. ..and will come for the real Mukul now? - Yes, sir. Did this boy tell them, where your son has gone? l didn't come to know that yet. The boy is unconscious. They dropped the senseless boy at the roadside. A newspaper hawker was passing by on cycle. He spotted the boy and informed his house. Three houses away from our house. Shivratan Mukherjee's house. The boy is his grandson. l came rushing to you after getting the news early morning. l know, me coming to you is an audacious act. We are ordinary people, what could we dare..? But still, if you could go for once.. ..then at least your to and fro expense.. Do you have telephone? - At the shop. You will find me if you call after ten in the morning. Three four five six three four. All right, l will call and let you know by afternoon. How could l.. - No need, because l have done nothing yet. But still, l was able to say everything to you, that's enough. Okay l'll leave. 'Number seven up Toofan express will leave.. ..from platform number eight at nine thirty five.' 'Your attention please.' 'Number seven up Toofan express.. .. will leave from platform number eight.. ..at nine thirty five.' - Here, M. Bose. A. Burman. Come on. The job of parapsychologist is to research.. ..on the.. the hazy subjects of human mind. Suppose, you were thinking about an old friend of yours. And right then he called you up. People will call this accident. But, parapsychologist will say, this happened due to telepathy. Telepathy? - Telepathy. You were thinking about your friend. That compelled him to call up. lt happened due to your telepathy. Understand? - Understood. And you think l will take up Mukul's case and go to Rajastan. And with this excuse you will get to.. ..bunk school and visit Rajastan. The time has not yet come to think so. You will take the case for sure. - How you know? Telepathy. - Trying to be smart? You know so much work is pending here. Firstly l have to make an estimate of expense. This client is not Kailash Chowdhry. Or Harish poddar from Jongipur. That he'll write cheque of thousand or two at the drop of a hat. Rather l'll perhaps have to spend some from my pocket. But, you say money is not always important? That's not for sure. Especially, when the life of a six year old child is at risk. But, saving him too.. would need some expense. l will have to bear that expense. Then there is railway booking. Have to change trains thrice for going to Jodhpur. Have to arrange accommodation in Jodhpur. Have to pick up woolen clothes from laundry, it's very cold there. And have to, go to your uncle Shibu's place. - Why? l need an information. Hemango Hajra. About ten years ago.. ..got involved in some messy matter. What messy matter? That is what l don't exactly remember. And that's why it's needed to go to your.. ..all knowledgeable uncle's place. Sixty two.. Nineteen sixty two.. Sixty two.. Nineteen.. Yes.. yes. Yes l got. ln nineteen sixty two, in Allahabad an impostor sage.. ..accompanied by his fraud disciple started a wretched.. ..business of curing people with so called supernatural process. Exactly like what was done in Europe.. ..in the eighteenth century by Anton Meslah. Bhavanando's business was flourishing when.. ..Hemango Hajra went there. And he caught the duo. - Due to which they got exposed. Bhavanando and Chelanando.. - Fled from there. l remember. Are you asking me in relation to the case.. ..of the boy called Mukul Dhar? Fortunately you didn't become a detective. Otherwise, we would had had nothing to do. lf l had done many things, many would had had.. ..nothing to do, Phelu. That's why l didn't do anything. l just opened the windows of mind and sat. So that air and light enter in and keep the mind fresh. You.. you are working as a detective. You deal with the dark side of human beings. But, because of that, don't let your mind get dark, Phelu. l too have kept the windows open. - You have? Who was William James Harshall? William James Harshall? - Englishman. l.C.S. Once he was posted in Bangladesh. ln the year eighteen eighty, one of his letters.. ..got published in the Nature magazine of England. With this letter it was discovered for the first time.. .. that criminals could be caught with finger prints. Wow.. wow. Let me see your fingers. Long live, Child. How do you like this fort, Mukul? - This is not golden fort. Do you know the name of this place? - Delhi. You remember the name of the place.. ..where your golden fort was? Think. No, l can't remember. Come, Grandson. They all have come to meet you. They are very good people. Look what they brought for you. You are a very courageous boy, so l give this to you. Look what's inside this. Pistol. lt is loaded. Happy l suppose? Now, tell them what they want to know from you. Let me start. As l heard from him. Last evening he went to the lane.. ..beside our house during the evening you know. To bring a fallen kite. - Nilu told me. Yes Nilu told. - Where was Nilu? On the roof of that house in front. - He called you by name? Yes. - Then, after he went, a car came and stopped in the lane. Taxi? - No, ordinary car. Black. Two men alighted from the car and asked him to show a house. Photik's house. - How did the men look? Had beard. - Both? Yes, both. They said they come from Beluchistan. Nonsense. - Then? Then after gagging and blindfolding me.. ..they took me to a house. Then, they asked, where is golden fort. l said, l don't know, Mukul knows. Then they asked, what is your name. l said, my name is also Mukul. Then they said, mistake.. mistake. Then.. then, they said, where is the other Mukul. l said, he is gone. They asked where. l said, Jaipur. - You said Jaipur? No.. no. Jodhpur.. Jodhpur. Then, they gave me a glass of milk to drink. l said, l don't drink milk at this hour. They opened my mouth forcefully and made me drink milk. Then, l got very sleepy. You understood why l'm scared l suppose? Take this. This is Dr. Hajra's visiting card. l wrote two lines behind it. Wow, you did a very wise job. And telegram? - You are free after asking. Was it ever possible for me? Fortunately an English professor of city college.. ..came to my store. But, you send me a telegram soon after reaching. Of course. - Look here. Prodosh Mitra arriving Jodhpur on eleventh. Tomorrow is ninth, you are setting off tomorrow, so.. Arriving Jodhpur on eleventh to ensure.. ..Mukul's safety against possible criminal activity. Wow. - He has added a suggestion. 'Number seven up Toofan express will leave.. ..from platform number eight at nine thirty five.' 'Number seven up Toofan express will leave.. ..from platform number eight at nine thirty five.' 'Tea.' 'Tea.' 'Tea, tea.' 'Tea, tea.' lt's not what you think. Three. Double six. Mukul, will you eat something? l have your food with me. - l eat chapatti (lndian bread). Chapatti? - Round ones, thick ones. You eat or you used to eat? - l used to eat. Who used to make? Your mother? Here l go. How's that? lt was five. lt was five so how you climbed this ladder? What? How funny? You say five, it looked four to me. Did l get cataract in my eyes? - Not cataract in eyes.. ..you got extra liquor in the stomach. There. Lessen it a little, everything will be all right. Go down the ladder. - Oh goodness. Mukul, was there hidden treasure in your house? Hidden treasure? - You told the reporters that many.. ..precious gemstone were kept hidden in your house? No, l didn't. - You didn't say? Weren't there red and blue stones in your house? There was. My father used to cut stones. Used to cut stones? - Yes. And those stones were embedded in jewelry? - yes. l see. Artisan, gem cutter. l am going out to the veranda. - Go, eat after coming. Go down. No need to see, it's snake mouth. Go to the tail-end. What happened? - l'll come. Come.. come. Come quickly. We'd play ludo. Excuse me, boy. Mukul. Start your trick. Mukul, want to see magic? - What magic? Watch this. Vanish. Gone? Watch this. There's more. Wait. Watch this. You are going to see golden fort l suppose? - Yes. ls your golden fort in Jodhpur? - l don't know. You don't know. Precious stones? - Diamonds, rubies, emeralds? What's in that bottle? - Sugarcane juice. Have you ever drank it. l will leave. - Come on, l will escort you. Where did he go? - Who? The man who showed me magic. - Wow. You watched magic l see. Sit.. sit, now you will eat. Allahabad. - Allahabad? Man, this Hajra is that same Hajra, who caught us there. This is the Hajra that we know. But, he is that same Hajra. Narrowly escaped eye to eye contact. So what would have happened?! When was Allahabad? Nineteen sixty two. Then you had a head full of hair. l had hair, mustache, beard, robe. Would he recognize? oh. l didn't realize this. - You don't realize anything. l will hit two targets with one arrow. l will get the boy and send Hajra to Allahabad. Finish him? - Finish him. Did he trouble me any less? Don't you know how many ways l took and left within.. ..these ten years? - Yes.. yes, three hundred at least. l don't have more than two suits, could you imagine?! You still have, l have managed from others. Top to bottom. Finish. Finish him.. So give me. - What? He is trouble, l don't feel comfortable. And l will have to do the job. Then why is it with you for no use l don't understand. Who told you there is no other way to finish him apart from that? Go, befriend him. That's your first job. Go, don't keep standing here. Stop. - Shall l stop? Have you decided how to introduce yourself? You don't need to worry for that. l scored fifty six in metric. Fifty six? ln what? - Geography. Okay. Now.. Watch this. Wait. This will be good. lt will be better on this. Watch. So how you like it? You are not just a globe trotter, you have many skills l see. l learnt all this abroad. l acquainted a magician in Geneva. Do you move with the articles? Yes, there is no shortage of kids all over the world. And it's joy to bring joy to them. You are going to Jodhpur l suppose? There's a fort on the way, we'll see that and then go to Jodhpur. Golden fort? - Could be. Tell me where is it? - ln the city of Jaipur. Nahargadh fort. - l see. There's a gentleman in my coop. Mr. Bagchi. He does research on forts. He too was talking about some Nahargadh fort. We'll reach at seven thirty in the morning. After seeing it, we'll go to Jodhpur by the evening train. l see. 'Tea.. tea.' Coolie! 'Tea.' - Here. 'Tea.' - Come on. l suppose leaving luggage at station is better. - Naturally. Otherwise, would you climb mountains with all this? Come on. Hey coolie. Topshey, eat the sweets. Train is running late, it will take time to reach Kanpur. There is time for breakfast. Wonderful sight, reminds of plane. l am worried, dear. lf Mukul stayed in Delhi for one day. And if the men set off day before yesterday. Then perhaps they are in the same train now. They won't harm Mukul. - Won't harm now. Because Mukul has the key to their motive. And Dr. Hajra? They people who could kidnap a seven year old child.. ..and drop him senseless on the roadside. l don't feel they would show any mercy.. ..on a fifty year old professor. You go ahead. - What happened? A chip got into my shoe. - All right, get rid of it. There is no train to Jodhpur before evening. Have you noticed a thing? - What? Another fort? - Where? Look there. There. There! Take it out. Take out, look through it. This is not golden fort. This is other fort. This is not golden fort. - Oh, shame.. shame.. shame.. shame. We came in vain. Come on, let's go back. There are a lot of forts to see. Where is he? - Who? Uncle doctor? - Vanish. You did magic? - Yes, magic. He won't come back? - Are you mad? He lost it on seeing camel.

This is my card. - l see.. And this is, Mr. Sudhir's letter. Tell me what the matter is? - l will tell. Before that, let me acquaint myself with Mr. Mukul. Mukul, look two of your friends have come. My name is Plelu, and he is Topshey. What are you drawing, Mukul? Mukul? - Golden fort. Come, be seated. Son of scorpion, are you there? Or not? You didn't notice anything abnormal? Any telephone, inquiry or something of that sort? Till now nothing. But, l didn't know the matter exactly. So l didn't care actually. - All right, l am here. But, you take a little care. Let me know.. ..as soon as you see anything suspicious. No need to say that. The prime responsibility is on me. You had been in Allahabad? l heard from someone how you intimidated Bhovanondo. That's an old history. Did you go out today? - Yes, we went to see the fort here. lt was so close, didn't even need to get down from the car. l see sand in the shoe. Nahargadh. - Nahargadh? There was sand in Nahargadh. Nahargadh means, the fort near Jaipur? - Yes. Jaipur falls on the way, so l thought.. ..to show him a fort of Rajasthan. That means you had to change train? - Yes. We went by the morning train and.. ..came back by the evening train. Vanish. - Vanish? The wicked man got vanished. - Which wicked man, Mukul? The wicked man who gets scared on seeing camel. And you don't get scared on seeing camel? l have rode on camel, there was camel in my house. My.. When he is in this birth, and when he.. ..goes to the previous birth, l just wonder. What is the plan for tomorrow? Tomorrow we are going to Bikaner. Fort. That is my job now. All right. We too will go. May l borrow this journal of parapsychology? - Sure, of course. Come on, Topshey. Oh l remember. Who else is Bengali here? ln circuit house? You two, us and Mr. Bose. He is tourist. One whom l did meet on the veranda? He is tourist? That's what he says. - lnteresting. All right, see you. He is so serious. You are talking about Mukul? He didn't even talk to me. ls he in normal conditions now? He is in a drowsiness. Until that drowsiness gets over, till then.. ..it's wrong to expect him behave normal. He left father, mother, brother and sister. With a complete stranger.. he came.. ..here fourteen hundred miles away. And is searching golden fort in western Rajasthan. Why is he so possessed with golden fort? ls it made of gold? l don't feel such a fort is there on the lndian land. - Then? Then we have to use our brain. ls golden boy made of gold? Golden Bengal. Golden harvest. Are they made of gold? lt seems they have not come. lsn't it? Perhaps they didn't get booking in train. Or perhaps they have boarded somewhere else not in circuit house. And if they don't come at all? - Then what? Then no worries. Brother Phelu! Call the waiter. Topshey, come and see. You won't get another chance of seeing this from so near. Look at the sting at the tip of tail. lf it bites? - Deadly poisonous. Certain death for children or old people. We'll be half dead. Look at this? How did this come to the room? - No idea, sir. Do one thing, remove all this. And clean this glass properly. What's the matter? l suppose l heard a noise? Look there. My goodness! l saw this in Brasil, mister. This one is pure lndian. Look at you. You people have come for holiday l suppose? Look what a start you had. No way that you can sit to relax somewhere. Be seated please. - l'll sit okay? You are a globe trotter. - You got that news? What places have you been? - What places l have been? lt easy to say what places l have not been, Brother. l left home at the age of sixteen. And last October, l came back to homeland after twenty six years. But, your Bengali didn't get much corrupted. A mark of North Kolkata is still there. You know what? lf you want to speak Bengali abroad, you can speak in three months. And if you don't want, you won't speak even in thirty years. But, l came in contact with Bengalis at intervals. For example, l did ivory business in Kenya.. ..for about five years. My partner was Bengali. You all are going to Bikaner tomorrow l suppose? You also join us. That l could go. You are coming for dinner l suppose? - Yes of course. We will talk then. Let me see, if some scorpion got into my room? l'll leave, Brother, okay? Did you see the shoe of the man who has.. ..returned to homeland after twenty six years? lsn't it Bata (brand)? - Certainly Bata. l won't be surprised to hear that the.. ..leather jacket was bought from Drarmatala. That means? - Means we have to keep a watch on the man. Topshey, bring out the torch. We can't be free of worry, Topshey. Good morning. - Good morning. No inconvenience l suppose? - Not yet. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Taxi has come for you. - Good. Send this telegram. lt's urgent. Let me see, brother. Let me.. let me. Go, keep in the car. Good morning! - Good morning. ls this a disguise? What a thrilling place, mister. Last night l challenged our hotel manager for arm wrestling. He didn't accept. - Escaped narrowly. Sorry? - Not you, him. Let me introduce. He is Lalmohan Ganguly, famous mystery thriller author. He is Mr. Bose, globe trotter. - Oh.. goodness. How wonderful. l will have to cultivate you, mister. You must have so much thrilling experience. l experienced everything but, getting cooked by cannibals. Ready? We'll see golden fort today? - Yes, Son. Come. What is that by your ear, mister? This is a new style. - Really? You didn't know? Come on, let's set off. Mr. Ganguly and Mr. Bose will be in one car. Going to fort? - Not Jodhpur. Bikaner. Bikaner? That is.. - Hundred and fifty miles away. We have lunch along, no need to worry. - Oh wow.. wow. But, l will go on share otherwise not. All right.. all right, get up first. Will we pass through the market? l needed a head protection. Give me, a toothbrush. Yes, fine. Fine. l have the same problem. - What happened? l too will take a round. Show me that blue one. What's the matter? - lt's three hundred miles journey. So l think l too will take one. - Three hundred miles? Bikaner is three hundred miles? Three hundred miles to and fro. - Say that. You rather take an extra one. How much? Have you been to Kathmandu? Have you been to Kalichowk? l will show you a thing. Only you could appreciate it. This is an un-safety razor, mister. A thing from Jang Bahadur Rana. Wow. l can understand that by the rust. So what are you doing with it? Mister, won't l carry a weapon in Rajasthan? How could it be? Which side are you fighting for? Mughol or Rajpoot? Driver, are there dacoits in Rajasthan or not? - There are. There are. So bloodshed in Rajasthan? - What? Wow.. wow.. wow.. wow.. wow.. wow. Wonderful. Excellent name. Wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. wait. l will write it down. First edition will get sold on the name you know. Bloodshed in Rajasthan. l killed a wolf with a knife like this. - Where? Tanganica. lnvincible forest and l was alone. Tanganika..? - Yes in Africa. Have you heard of? l have novel on Africa, mister. Shiver in Sahara. The same Africa. So.. Not hyena l guess? - Hyena? Yes l mean, you didn't kill a hyena mistaking it a wolf l guess? What a problem, mister!? Hyena is in China! l killed wolf with my own hands, and he says hyena! There is no wolf in Africa. No? Have you been? - No, l haven't been.. Say that. Wolf is bred in Africa, do you know that? Have you seen Saturflower? - What? Saturflower? Look there. lt blossoms on Saturdays, understand? lt blossoms on Saturdays. You don't know things of your land and talking of Africa. Your para-psycho.. You said something. - You had been awake at night, right? Yes, l had to read the notes at night, so. No, l was saying that it's very interesting.. ..to know that hypnotism is used in parapsychology. Does hypnotism really reveals hidden information? lt is said so. You know hypnotism? - No. You know? There's peacock! Peacock! What's the matter? Won't you get down? No, about peacock l have.. - Allergy? Here, have a look. l was holding the.. ..grills of a cage, in zoo. - Pecked? Forty years ago. Wow. National bird. lt's better to tell you one thing. Keep a watch on that globe trotter. lt's nothing but, being careful. - Oh. Okay? Okay l will take care. Mukul! Why are you showing me wrong fort time and again? Mukul, if you had told us the name of the place. Then we would have shown you golden fort immediately. l am hungry. - l told you to eat so many times, you didn't eat. What happened? ls he feeling sick? - No, he is feeling upset. Why? - He is searching for golden fort but, not finding. Golden fort? - You all go and visit. l will feed him. Come on, l'll tell you everything while seeing the fort. lt's needed to enlighten you a little. Come, Mr. Bose. - You all go ahead. l'll ease myself and come. l see they have built a fort wherever they found a place. How long will you keep wandering? lt's leaving a hole in pocket. Why behaving like this? - Why is he suspecting you? Who? - Who else but, lizard? What mess did you make? l didn't make any mess in front of him. - Then where? Well l didn't know that there is no wolf in Africa. l will manage it now. You don't need to worry. Cannot delay anymore. - That l understand. But, how to increase the speed? There is a way. Hypnotism can bring back.. ..the memories of previous birth. You'll use hypnotism? Not in practice for a long time, so l am wondering. There is nothing to wonder. lt's like riding cycle. Nobody forgets after learning for once. You get going. At the earliest, l will manage that side. This is a wonderful matter, mister. l couldn't even imagine that l will see a reincarnation.. That gentleman is parapsychologist. - Quite famous. Doesn't seem to be, what say? Does it seem that you are an mystery thriller author? But, you behave like a detective. Yes l remember. Highly suspicious. The man says.. - Here. l thought you all disappeared. How did l do? - Do what? Wolf? You didn't understand that l was testing you? Full marks. How many people know that.. ..there is no wolf in Africa? What say, Mr. Mitra? lt doesn't seem that many people know.. ..apart from you and l. - Here, he knows. l will have to read your book, mister. Do you have a copy? Silver in Sahara? - Silver?! You are funny, mister! Hurry up. Hurry up. Take this, wipe face. Don't go far. l am in the car. Mukul. Open the door. Open the door Open the door! Open the door! - What's the matter? He was calling me. - Who was calling? Wicked man. - Who wicked man? From previous birth or this birth? l don't like it, Topshey. l don't like. l am getting a vision.. then it's disappearing again. Some people, few of them are in masks. Some others in dim light, some in darkness. One is Mander Bose. - No doubt. He has put on the mask of globe trotter. But, who is he actually? ls he one of those two? That man with injured leg? He is making rounds of circuit house at night. ls he the other villain? Searching for hidden treasure? Or another man coming with another intension? And who else? - And Dr. Hajra. Hajra unmasked Bhavanondo. But, is he himself in mask? Otherwise, while in the car today, reincarnation was.. ..sitting by side, perhaps golden fort too would.. ..get discovered in a few hours, how could he fall asleep? A feeling of despair keeps awake among many pains. Dr. Hajra..? - Hajra is not the only one. There is one man more mysterious than him. - Who? Mukul's wicked man. Who gets scared on seeing camel. Man who got vanished. Vanished where? Vanished when? How do Mukul know the word vanish? Shouldn't we ask Mukul? Very good, Topshey. l too was considering the same. Apart from memories of previous birth.. ..what else is there in the boy's mind..? Tell me what is this, Mukul? - Pen. Now? - Torch. ln this torch, you could see your golden fort. - Where? lnside this light. - Where? Couldn't be here. Come. Come. Come.. come. Sit here. Now, l will point this light at your face. You keep looking at it. Okay? Then l could see golden fort? - Yes. Ready? - Ready. Mukul, keep looking at the light. At the light you keep looking. Keep looking at the light. Keep looking. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Golden fort. Mukul. Mukul, do you hear me? - l do? Where is your golden fort? What is the name of the place? Do you remember? - Jai.. Jaipur. Jai.. Say. Jai.. sal.. mer. Put on the light. Jaisalmer.. Jaisalmer.. Jaisalmer. Yes Jaisalmer. Two hundred miles, there's train. - When? Nine forty five in the morning. lt will go to Pokhran, eighty miles. From there one twenty miles by motor. Why not the whole way by motor? lt will be four to five hours. No. You will go by motor. - l? Yes. Listen to the plan. l'll tell them that l am taking rest today. Then they will go to see the Jodhpur fort. l will immediately go to the station and you stay back here. When they come back, you tell them that.. ..Mukul has told the name of the place. Dr. Hajra has left with Mukul by motor. Left for where? - Badmed. Will you remember? Badmed? - Badmed. Shall l send them to Badmed? - You don't need to send.. ..they themselves will go. lf they ask why didn't Dr. Hajra wait for us? Then you say Mukul was impatient, he was restless. Okay, boss. - And then you'll set off. Pokhran? - Pokhran, by taxi. l'll meet you there? - You'll meet. From there to Jaisalmer? - Jaisalmer. Okay, boss. Now put the boy on bed. Go. ''Who is uncle? Who is aunt? What is pilgrimage?'' ''Now l came to know where the hidden treasure is.'' Mukul, shall l click your picture? Good morning. Breakfast is done? - Yes. l get up at dawn. So l have a bad habit of body pampering. That's why you look so fit. What are you doing today? - Rest. Mukul too needs some. And it would be better if l could sit alone and think in silence. Some new thought? l was thinking, camel, sand, fort and peacock, aren't.. ..all these found together at a place somewhere out of lndia. Or they weren't. lt's not necessary that the previous birth was in this country. This idea didn't exactly strike me till now. l was thinking, if l could talk to Mukul sometime today. That's fine. You all are going out. Come back then we'll sit together. l am wondering about one thing since yesterday. Why are you researching about such strange things, mister? lsn't it better not to encourage nonsense of reincarnation.. ..and all in a country which is already so full of superstition? Finally you will see children in every house.. ..will claim themselves as reincarnation. Then how many will you take along and explore the whole nation? Morning. - Don't release it. What? - We will go out. - ln this? Yes. - Hey driver, keep waiting. l am also leaving, mister. To Jaipur. - You leaving? Yes, this place is very dry. Topshey, keep a watch on the road? Why, Brother Phelu? Tell me if you see a lame man in red shawl. What is the matter, mister? We are also searching for mystery just like you. Mystery? You know, for a long time l wish to get involved.. ..into a real mystery with a real detective. Perhaps that won't happen. And Mr. Das? Das is also not there? What? Dr. Hajra? l see. l see. Thank you. None of the two names you said is at circuit house. There was a small boy, he too has left with Dr. Hajra for somewhere. My God. Look, l am Dr. Hajra. He is impostor. A criminal. l.. l am a famous parapsychologist. What? - You know telepathy? Telepathy? - Yes.. yes. No, sir. - You don't know? No, sir. Telephone yes. Telegraph yes. Telescope yes. Teleprinter yes. But, no telepathy. - l see. Okay, tell me something. - What? Was any battle fought in Jaisalmer? Nothing is written in guide book. But, it is very important for me. l know it was fought. Long time ago. Allauddin Khilji invaded Jaisalmer. Look.. look, what nice stone articles are placed in the shop? Have you ever seen articles of yellow stone like this? Hey stop.. stop. That yellow bowl in your window.. - Made of stone? Yes, please show me that. Wow. Wonderful thing. What's the price? The price is twenty five rupees. - Where is it made? Made in Jaisalmer. Very nice thing, take it. Jaisalmer.. Yellow lime stone. Mr. Lalmohan, come. Where are you going? The room is locked. - What? Yes, they left a couple of hours ago. - Where? He said the child remembered the name of the place. l have noted it down. Damn it. Yes here it is. B A D M E D. - Badmed? Does it exist? l have never heard of. Why left in so much haste? - The child was impatient. He dragged, tore his sleeve and almost hijacked him. Badmed..? He said, tell Mr. Mitra to follow contact through letters. l am waiting for you only. My train has almost arrived. Reincarnation is gone? What happened, mister? You are completely.. Oh. Will you eat? Bowl of golden stone. Hajra.. Please give me the booking register. Disaster. A taxi, Jaisalmer and back. Topshey, order three packet lunch, need within half an hour. How powerful is, Phelu Mitra's telepathy.. let's see. How long will Bhavanondo play his deceiving game.. ..let's see that as well. Earthquake, landslide, tsunami.. l don't understand anything. Oh no. Topshey, We'll take your suitcase, pack up your clothes. Mr. Lalmohan. - Tell me. You helped me in a special way by drawing.. ..my attention towards golden stone bowl. That's why l am giving you the opportunity to fulfill your wish. Fine. How many minutes do you take for packing? - Three minutes. Three. What bad luck. l will tell you everything when it's the right time. But, now you can't ask any question. Can you give me your words? - Fine. Take. He'll go to Jaisalmer. l will make you loose miserably. Could l ask about our destination? - Jaisalmer. lt was the capital of Bhati Rajpoots. Eight hundred years old fort and city in Thar desert. The stone your bowl is made of.. ..that fort too is made of that same stone. Hence we can assume there is only one fort.. ..in Rajasthan that could be called golden fort. And my firm belief is.. l came to give a tip to Mr. Mitra before leaving. Male, suspect him if you find him less than five and half feet. l'll leave. You know what l feel? - What? We will meet again. That will be my absolute fortune. l'll leave, Mr. Mitra. Bye.. bye, Mr. Jatayu. Scorpion in Brasil. Scorpion in Brasil. Scorpion. Scorpion in Brasil. Mr. Lalmohan, camel! Look there is camel! May l ask question about camel? - You may. Are these wild camels? - Possibly not. What do they feed on? - Mainly thorny shrubs. Do they leave the thorns? - No. l won't ask question. l will just, say something. May l? - Say. lf you people have risk of getting into trouble. Then l hope, you people have weapon for self defense? Because, mine is gone. - What? Who took? Dacoits. One of the innumerable dacoits in this dacoit infested country. Only.. this thing is left back. - Wow. Very non greedy dacoit l see. Even the sheath won't be less expensive. Hence, if you people land in trouble.. ls your tyre old? - Sir, come out and see here! lt is.. it is! Our telepathy is powerful! We are on the right path hence this.. ..arrangement for stopping our journey! You change the tyre. Topshey, come let's remove these. Mr. Singh, drive carefully. One more puncture will mess up everything. No questions. No questions. No questions. Mr. Lalmohan, two very carefree villains.. ..have gone to Jaisalmer with Mukul along. ln search of hidden treasure. When we will reach them, there's a possibility.. ..of a confrontation between them and us. lf you could bear that, then perhaps your.. ..twenty eighth novel will come out good. May l ask you something now? - You may. Are you a detective? Yes. But, not exactly like Prokhar Rudra. Private investigator? And Master Tapeshranjan is my satellite. So are we chasing dacoits now? Dacoits for sure. But, not from Aravalli, from Kolkata. lf you have the least of doubt, then we could drop you at Pokhran. Why? - You will get a train? Shall l go back? - l said there is danger ahead. Danger? You are scaring me of danger? Me Jatayu?! Mr. Singh! Mr. Singh! Any idea who has done this? He has collected all kinds of glasses from all over the world. Then guess who has done it. Brother Phelu! No town, no village nothing. Even the railway track has disappeared. We couldn't have got the train anyway. lt has reached Pokhran by now. - lt could be late. Mr. Singh, we'll get spare if another taxi comes l suppose?! We'll get, sir but, traffic is very less on this road! Which is the nearest station here? Ramdeoura would be about seven to eight miles. Are you considering the night train? The night train reaches Ramdeoura at three am. lf we could go to station and wait.. ..the taxi could go and meet us after repairs. Otherwise, we could board the night train. When does it reach Jaisalmer? - Seven thirty in the morning. Will you people go to Ramdeoura? lf the taxi doesn't get repaired we'll have to catch a train. Will you go on camel? Look there. Yes, stop them. - Hey! Hey! What, Mr. Jatayu? Will you go on camel? - On camel? Yes. - Wow. l couldn't even imagine that all my dreams will come true like this! Power of telepathy. Get ready. lf l had expected some more..! Watch the way how a camel sits, Mr. Lalmohan. First it folds the front legs, then the hind legs. And just the opposite while getting up. Keep that in mind and move your body accordingly. Then no disaster will happen. Watch me. Topshey, get up. Are you fine? - Excellent. Mr. Lalmohan, you get up. lt's very easy. ls it okay? Take to Ramdeoura. Mr. Singh, come immediately after the car gets repaired! Certainly, sir! l'll come for sure! Very thrilling, Brother Phelu. Take care behind you. Mr. Lalmohan! - Yes?! What's does your dream feel now?! - My goodness! lt's reality! The place you are sitting on! - Yes?! The camel's water is stored inside that! How will camel's water help me!? Do you also need a hump!? - Not hump, l need a pitcher! My throat got dry! Brother Phelu, train! Turn the camel. We have to stop that train. Come on. Look there they are! There! Well done. Take to Ramdeoura. What's the matter? - Why? l saw them on camels. - What are you saying? The man is dangerous, mister. l said Badmed but he got Jaisalmer. Look, l think they are going to Ramdeoura, the previous station. From there they will board train at night. You understand. l will drop you there. You finish your job and come straight to Jaisalmer. Job means? Finish l suppose? All right. Oh l remember! One minute. - What's the matter? l remember. Give some money, l have nothing. All got spent on glasses. l need to have something at night? Have means? - Solid. And liquid? - Only Horlicks (health drink). Remember it. - No need to say that. Come on. Come on, get up now. Get up. Get up. Hold my hands.. hold my hands. Hold. Hold with that. Hold. That's it. Now get up. Get up. That's it! Very good! - What happened? Did you also get a hump? - No, now l feel a little fit. Come on, eat sweets. - Wait, let me freshen up. Take, Topshey. Topshey, keep a watch on the road. - For taxi, right? Start running on seeing headlights. Oh, this is such an experience, mister.. ..it's better than even a novel. Oh. So do you assume that experience is over? No, l mean no camel anymore. - No, perhaps no more. Then? - Everything is trifle.. trifle in comparison to camel. Dangerous animal, mister. Come. Special food for Aravalli dacoits. lf l had my weapon now.. You know, l would have felt relaxed. lt was a very nice thing. Does your Prokhar Rudra use a dagger? Prakhar Rudra? Ask him. So? Topshey? - Revolver. What kind of revolver, does your Prakhar Rudra use? Now what is kind and all? Revolver is revolver. Now what is kind and all? Revolver is revolver. That's it! Like this? This is called Colt point three two. Loaded? These are bullets. Bang.. bang.. bang.. bang.. bang.. bang. This is trigger. This is hammer. There are many makes other than this. Many bore, caliber. - ls it? You need to know all this. lf you write without knowing, everything.. ..will become stomach of camel. Mr. Jatayu. Mr. Lalmohan, wake up. Topshey, wake up, train has arrived. Topshey, get up. Mr. Lalmohan, get up. Goodness. Topshey, put on light.. put on light. Light's not working, Brother Phelu. - What? Light not working. Oh, there's no bulb. - Dacoits. No need to see. Mr. Lalmohan. - Yes? Look that side, there is switch. - ls it? Yes. Look.. look. Here. - Wow. Oh dear. - Night light. Anyway this will be enough. Topshey, unwrap the bedding. Spread it and go to sleep. Mr. Lalmohan and you on births, l will be in middle here. l'll rather sleep on bunk you rather sleep below. Do as l say. Rather let me sleep here. - No, sir. Oh, you'll do yoga and exercise in the morning? Yoga is there. lf someone messes.. ..then l have to exercise on him as well. My goodness. Yoga, exercise, you know many things l see. Since l saw your weapon, l feel much relaxed. Oh no. latch is missing. - Dacoit. Dacoit. What happened?! Disciple of Bhavanondo, your deceiving game is over now. Get up. Get up.. get up! Get up and stand. Stand. Hands up. Up hands up! Now step back. Step back. You know what penalty you'll face? Three months jail and hanging for seven days. Now say, what happened in Nahargadh fort? Say.. say. There is four hours time. No hurry. Relax and say slowly. What are you doing?! He went to the next compartment, Brother Phelu. Mr. Jatayu, even Prakhar Rudra will loose if you are along. Enemy.. is very fierce. So? Are there dacoits in Rajasthan or not?! The night is still not over. You don't know Mander Bose! Hey, who is it?! Get out of the compartment! This is reserved! Hey door! Get shut! lsn't it Mr. Das? Or is that also your fake name? You recognize me? We are very old acquaintance. There in Allahabad. Nineteen sixty two. You remember? Who screamed, Brother Phelu? The problem finished it seems. Topshey. Golden fort. Mr. Lalmohan, get up. - On camel? No.. no. Get up. Jaisalmer has come. - Has come? You both wait. Come. Dr. Hajra? This is, my identity. And this is Mr. Sudhir's letter. Come to the waiting room, l will tell you everything. l have to hear a lot from you as well. And Mukul? - He is, possibly somewhere inside his golden fort. A taxi is supposed to come. For the time being we have to wait for that. There is no other transport here. l can tell you one thing. My responsibility is not any less than yours.. ..to bring back Mukul unharmed. Do you recognise, Mukul? - Golden fort. And your house? - There is a town inside the fort, there. ls it? Come. Then come with me. There is no hidden treasure? Are you sure? lt's written in my notebook. Mukul said his father was an artisan of gems. Hence, he would have seen precious stones at home. This is very obvious. Mukul! Mukul! What are you doing there? Mukul. Mukul, come down. Come down. There was a temple. Temple. Mr. Singh! Mr. Singh.. Mr. Singh! Brother Phelu! Taxi has come. So then we'll leave, Dr. Hajra. Our luggage will be here. You take rest. Let Mukul come back unharmed. l don't want anything more than that. - We'll leave. Oh, l remember. This will perhaps help you. lt belongs to Mander Bose. - This is mine! Temple. - And.. and your house? The house? This is Ratan's house. This is Giridhari's house. We used to celebrate Holi (color festival) here. This is the way. - What way? Way to our house. - Which one? Which one is your house? There, on the right. - Come with me. Hey. Hey.. hey, shoo.. shoo.. shoo! Go.. go.. go.. - Why chasing it? Why chasing the peacock? Why are you chasing it? - Go.. go.. go! Go! Shoo.. shoo.. shoo.. Don't kill it! You are wicked man. You are wicked man. You are wicked man. - Mukul. Mukul! Mukul! Shall l also come? - Come. Mukul! Mukul? Topshey, you go that way, l'll see here. Mukul! Mukul! Mukul! Well done, Topshey. You toiled so much in vain, Mr. Bhavanondo. Because there is no hidden treasure. Not if there is previous birth. Not even if there isn't. Mr. Singh, catch him. We have to go to police. Very good, sir. Brother Topshey. Brother Topshey, look he is on a ride. Come down, Mukul. We will go now. Where will we go? - Say where you want to go? l will go home, to Kolkata. - l too will go to Kolkata! l have to write novel number twenty eight! Brother Phelu, Brother Topshey. We all will go to Kolkata. You, l, brother Topshey, Mr. Lalmohan. Everybody. We all will drop you to your house.
