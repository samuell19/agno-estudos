Sleep, baby sleep Baby will sleep soon! Sleep, baby sleep Baby will sleep soon! The frame isn't made of the same wood as the bedposts. They require a harder wood, much finer, with denser fibers. They are made from yew wood. - Cemetary trees? - Yes. They are marvelous. Very interesting. Poisoned splinters bring death. Hard wood defies time and allows the creation of fine pieces. Without yew wood, there is no spindle, and without the spindle... We lost track of the time. Like the scatterbrains you are. I'll let you make your gifts, I've already made mine. The princess will die when she's 16 years old. From piercing her hand with a spindle made of yew. We mustn't worry the princess. - You must put it right. - You're more experienced than we are. Carabosse is a most powerful fairy. I can't fight against her. You've bragged of your experience. I have more than you. Let me concentrate. I can ameliorate Destiny. - Show-off! Quiet! The princess will not die, she'll merely fall asleep. Her sleep will last 100 years. 100 years? What a drag. Why not 2000? We can make the best of it. We were late because of you. Admit it. I could say that the princess could play hooky, and live her life in a dream. I'll make it so that she pierces her hand at 6, and awakes at 16. What for? In any case, childhood is interminable. GOOD AND PEACEFUL SLEEP, ANASTASIA. Six Years Later You remember your anger when you learned that I was pregnant? And look at you now, besotted for your granddaughter. You weren't like that with me. You were a lot less well-behaved. I am the knight Vladimir. I am the knight Vladimir. You must realize that you're not a boy. Yes! And I am the knight Vladimir! Unfortunately, Anastasia, Nature has decided otherwise. I am a princess. It's me who decides! No. Anastasia, what have you done this time? You'll kill me. You see what you've done to your beautiful dress? It's ruined. Dresses are stupid. I'll wear no more of them. But that one fit you like a dream. I'm not a dream, I'm a knight. Fine, I'll get some bandages. Ouch. You should have thought first. Now I have to disinfect it. It didn't even hurt. Knights don't feel pain, you know... Try to arrive at adulthood in one piece. Ah, my brave soldiers. My army against sleep. But look out: I'm the Commander in Chief. So... Aside from my alarm clocks, Above all I love my dictionaries. Their words tell me stories better than any novel. No, not stories. They tell me the sense of things. Everything is recorded. Every word is like a tarot card that tells Destiny. "Herbeline. "Noun. Feminine. Thin ewe kept in seclusion." Like me. I'm a herbeline. "Hermaphrodite. "Noun and adjective. Masculine. From 'Hermaphrodite'... Mythological. Said of a being that unites the characteristics of both sexes. The leech is a hermaphrodite. In zoology, what one calls the creatures that have a male genital gland and a female genital gland (leech), the creatures that..." We must utilize our powers. - If that's what you can call it. - You want to demoralise us? Believe in my experience: If she must sleep a hundred years, it is time for her to sleep a hundred years all at once. Only our goddaughter doesn't live in a fairy-tale castle. The ancient times are past. Someone who sleeps a hundred years won't pass unobserved in modern times. We can't put her entire world to sleep. We'll be more discreet than the first time. If she wakes 100 years later, alone in the world... she could die of fright. - We must warn her. She can't know. It would be too cruel. You don't know mankind: They know they will die, and they live without thinking about it. They even waste their time. THEY WASTE THEIR TIME? Of course. It's even their favorite pasttime. Miss Anastasia, you will end up waking the dead! And in your family, there's one you shouldn't wake. Drat, drat and drat! If I'm a princess that can't do what I want, what's the point? But must I really die? You must sleep. Don't over-dramatize. It's going to be very annoying in 100 years, if you don't keep your promise. You have the key, you will escape. I want to shiver, you understand? It's crazy how sometimes time passes slowly. Three or four days before the performance seemed interminable. I was in a hurry for the disaster to happen and change my life. The life of a little girl, it's very annoying. With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls Walk in rhythm Through the blooming meadows Winter is over, the dawn with burning eyes Tints the dew with pink and blue Then this, then that, when the sun flies up With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls Walk in rhythm through the blooming meadows Get onstage! I don't want to be in a girl show! Do it for your grandmother. What's the point, if Papa isn't here? Get away from me, you rot! We're going to talk, the two of us. I don't speak to rot covered with boils. I am your own rot. Come, I'll give you a chance. If you can knock down the crossed shinbones, if you can do it, then you are free. If not you'll end like the others, beheaded, deliciously rotting. Hand me that. Whatever your heart desires. I am true, all is false. I am in a hurry to finish with you. You're not very big, you'll make a nice appetizer. It isn't possible... Twice in a row? Yes! And you don't even exist! Yes...it's started to freeze. Are you from among the living? Mama, is that the little sister that you promised me? It's... But you're a real little girl of flesh and blood. I'm hungry. You want some? Poor little dumpling... And there you go. Clean as a new penny. Good for giving to the saddler, all this. You look like a real little boy like that. If I'd expected a girl to fall out of the sky... That looks great on me. You know, even if I am bigger than you, we're going to be great friends. No, no, no, stop. No, no. No, don't tease her. No, Peter! Yes, that's it! Spin her around, that's great. That's great. Continue. It's not nice what you did. It was very naughty. You'll see, in the spring, We'll have roses of different colors. You're hurting them. If I don't do that, there won't be any roses. This way, they'll be forever beautiful. Eternity doesn't exist. You see that? Those are called "eyes". I'll leave three or five, it depends, and from every eye will grow a large stem full of a new force. But when you cut off the tops of the oaks, they never grow back the same. Because they're trees. It's pretentious and ugly to want to constrain trees. But the more you cut the more they grow, because they're brambles. Do you believe me? Yes, because you can't be bad. Look. It's the Queen. The others force-feed her royal jelly, so much that she can't move. She is the prisoner of her duty. I'm afraid! I don't want to be like her! But you won't, that won't happen to you. Don't cry. You aren't a bee. I don't want to be buried so I can't move. Never again! Don't cry, I'm here. Nothing will happen to you. I'll protect you, agreed? You promise? Here. It's too much! It's like a shower of edelweiss. Those are white bees. Do they also have a queen? Certainly. The most beautiful and the coldest of them all. The Queen of Ice. She can't be caught. Never does she land. If she lands, all at once, hop! She takes off to hide among the black clouds. During the winter nights, it's she who roams the streets of the cities. Her cold gaze covers the windows with tiny patterns of frost. It would be beautiful to see her. Don't say that, you wretch. Anywhere she gazes, everything becomes gloomy and cold. Come on. To bed. I hate this Snow Queen. If she comes, I'll put her on the burning stove and she'll melt. You're foolish. I'd love to see her. I'm sure that it would be marvelous. Can you imagine? To live in the land of eternal snow. You're making me cold. I saw her. I saw the Snow Queen. - First off, she doesn't exist. - I saw her, I tell you. She looked me in the eyes. I felt a shard of ice pierce my heart. I want to sleep... Why are you crying, you idiot! Wipe away these tears, they make you frightful! Besides I'm not hurting anymore. The only thing that hurts me, is to see how everything is ugly, sinister and shrunken here! And you're as ugly and thin as a rat. You should see yourself, my poor girl, and understand what it's like living with you. A skinny stupid dwarf! A nice present you've become! What's happened to you, Peter? Do me the favor of apologizing imm?diately. Apologizing for what? You think it's a life, for a boy my age, to be shut up with his mother and an ugly girl like her? I'm sure that whatever's in your eye... keeps you from seeing the nice side of things. Let me see. Lower your head. I don't see anything. No, I don't see anything. Obviously, idiot! It was a moment ago I was in pain. Now it goes well, and I am very happy with my new perception of things. Poor Peter, you think you're grown-up and intelligent. You know what's happened? You're at the difficult age, my boy. - Peter... - Now what? You've never spoken to me as cruelly as you did now. There's a first time for everything. Explain to me what has happened. I don't know. Perhaps... Nothing is stable in life. The only stability is boredom. Boredom. You can't know how it imprisons me, how I feel I'm in a perpetual vice. Is this a life, to stay in this tiny house, with only my mother and... You're very nice, in a state of blissful wonder, as if it were enough to be blissful in order to be happy. You're not happy? Yes, but now, I'm not anymore. I want to live, and I know what you call happiness will keep me from iving. Where is it? Where is it? "Puberty. Collection of physiological and psychological modifications that are produced with the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics". It's noted in the definition. - Where are you going? - Where I want! You've been brave, we've gone at a good pace. I am the Snow Queen. But you are entirely frozen. You'd do best to get under my furs. Is that better? My sled...Where is my sled? It's behind you. Your childhood is now behind you. Now I'll no longer kiss you, for a final kiss would be your death. Impudent boy, you're lucky I wish to spare you. Who are you? Phantom train 1724 mustn't stop. You mustn't stop here. You are therefore doubly in violation, we don't let bare feet into the kingdom! It isn't my fault. Somebody left me here. I didn't ask them to. If I'm barefooted, it's because I left looking for my friend. No one ever stops here. We put up mannequins to discourage all intrusions, in the hope that no invasion comes during a storm, for evidently, we must arrange them so that they don't blow away. Excuse me, I've got work to do. This is a very peaceful country, that doesn't tolerate strangers. You'd better leave. How I'd love to have a doll like you. Hey, you! I'm closing the station. You can't stay. Besides, it's dangerous at night. Tell me where I can sleep. Is there a hotel? You're stubborn! I told you they don't allow strangers. What am I going to do? I'd like to go somewhere. I waited for a train but none stopped. I could take you to the prison, but it's full. Our princes are very cruel. What have you come to do in this country? It's because of Peter, he's my friend. A wonderful boy, much taller than you. Ssh! Be careful. This isn't the place to make yourself noticed. He disappeared six months ago. He's taller than me. He has flashing eyes. He's very strong. He's the most intelligent boy I've ever known. He can calculate in his head fractions and square roots. It might be. It might be that I've seen him. Thank you, that's the best news this year! Calm down! Show a little reason! This isn't the place to make yourself noticed. Don't make me say what I haven't said. I said: It could be that the one I'm thinking of is whom you're looking for. Maybe or maybe not. I've said nothing more. Walk through this gallery. Your destiny awaits you. Make up your mind, I don't have much time. It's getting late. Be careful you don't offend the queen, she has a terrible temper. I don't know if I should let you in. Hide in here. Don't move for any reason until it chimes midnight. - I prefer the suit of armor. - No, don't argue. I'll come back to look for you later on tonight. And be careful that no one notices you. "Be careful that no one notices you." Honestly... It's good that I especially like the sound of alarm clocks, and that the tick-tock of my own is something I miss, because from this point of view, I was spoiled: I had to count 2,000,550 tick-tocks and hear chime seven times the hours and as many times the half-hours, before you came to get me out of there. Come with me, I'll show you the way. Don't be afraid, you shouldn't meet anyone, but be careful. You mustn't be noticed. "Be careful, you mustn't be noticed"... My God, that's all they say here. - Did you see their dreams? - They passed too quickly. Yes, evidently, it takes a certain experience. They dream that they are alone in the world on an island of precious pearls and gold, and it will be thus for all Eternity. Every night they dream the same thing. Evidently, Peter loves to make the same drawings and have always the same dreams. My job is finished here, young lady. If you achieve honors and dignity, we hope that you will remember us. - Yes. - But if it turns out badly, you've never seen me. Understand? You must be very careful. You mustn't be noticed. Have no fear. A brother can't recognize his sister. Peter... Peter, it's me. Peter, wake up. Guards! Guards! Seize her! Shall we cut off her head? Have mercy! My dear, you should have been cautious and not make yourself noticed. Ah, now we're not so proud. You are guilty of the crime of offending royalty. Let her go! She's only a child. Certainly, she's connected to people of greater size, but she's only a child. Do you understand you took a great risk in coming fraudulently into my room? So that I might choose to let you live, you must tell me everything. Or would you prefer to lose your head? But I'm telling the truth. Someone spoke so well of the prince, that I believed he could only be my friend Peter. How could I know this wasn't him, when I'd left to look for him? Peter is exactly the same, with all the best qualities in the world, in fact. You're right. My prince is wonderful. Like Peter. You're lucky, because you found him. I'll never find Peter. What time is it? Oh, it's too lovely! I love watches and alarm clocks. I give it to you. Oh, thank you! Thank you. I'm confused, Your Highness. In any case, I'm very happy. I've arranged that you be provided with delicacies. Farewell. Never fear: You will find Peter. It was a long time ago that I lost him. Patience. Time seems very long because you are so young, but you'll see, I who am older than you... How lucky you are. Don't say that, wretched one. Time passes quickly. And you'll realize that soon enough. Goodbye, Your Highness. Goodbye, Your Majesty. Goodbye. - Her flesh must be tender. - Let her go! Let her go! She's mine, you understand? Let her go! They won't kill you as long as I don't get angry with you. But if I do get angry with you, it's I that will kill you. You are no doubt a princess. No. And I told her my story. She thought that I had experienced some very strange things, and that in comparison, although she was older than me, nothing had happened to her at all. This is Granny, called Old Shrew. What? It was she who led the men in the attack, but now, she's old, so she can't do anything. That's very funny, my girl! I've got 24 of them. Kiss him! Don't be afraid. These pigeons are domesticated. They are afraid of us, not the other way around. This one, you should keep your eye on. If not, she'll take off, and with such speed, you won't have a chance to catch her. Every night, it amuses me to tickle her neck, so that she knows what it's all about. What if she doesn't like it? What if she doesn't like it at all? I give the orders. Come on, we're going to bed. Aren't you going to keep your knife while you sleep? I always sleep with it. You never know. Are you afraid that I'll do to you what I did to the doe? I know very well you're going to do it. I'm not even afraid. You know that this is a real knife. I press a little harder... Blood trickles. You can't know how it makes me itch. I know that if I do it, afterwards, I will slit your throat. I don't wish to. I don't want to. But I'm itching to. Aren't you afraid? Aren't you afraid of me? You are mad. You must never trust me. I am not bad, but that's what excites me. Sometimes, I can't control myself anymore. You are brave for a girl. It's the princess that gave them to me. Do you only meet princes and princesses? High society, that's how it is with them. The Queen of England doesn't meet just anyone. You talk in your sleep, you're too funny. It's a kind of dream, but not so stupid. Would you really like to find your friend Peter? - I would give my life. - Don't say that. Life's precious. I believe that he's in Laponia. I can't think of where else he could be. But if you swear you will return and give yourself up... I swear. Oh my, all of this... It's good, huh? - But it sticks to your teeth. All the men have left, there's only my grandmother left. She won't leave. She's tough. But she has a thing for the bottle. What am I doing here? Help! Get me out of here! Who put me here? Get me out of here! Little thieves! Stay there! Who are these little thieves? I would have liked to keep her. But too bad, I'm going to untie her and let you go, so that you can return to Laponia. Now I don't want to leave. Eat, my doe. eat. Perhaps I'll die of cold before the end. You took your time getting here! I know you're very clever. You could, with a bit of string, tie up all the winds on earth. If you undo the first knot, there's a good wind. Untie the second, ships slice through the waves quickly. But if you untie the third and fourth, you will raise a storm that will blow down all the forests on earth. And you know how to make a potion that gives the strength of a dozen men. Not so quickly, my young friend. I only do what is just, and what I have to do. Help me to tear Peter from the clutches of the cruel Snow Queen. Ssh! Ah...You see... Let me mull it over. But your case isn't an easy one. Oh no, no, no. It isn't easy. "When the dragon rampant "bites the tail of the winged dragon, "and the winged dragon "swallows the tail of the dragon rampant, "and the dragon rampant "absorbs the winged dragon, "the result is... the Ouroboros!" Is this the Ouroboros? This Book of Spells comes to me to confirm... Your friend is a prisoner of the Snow Queen. But he is very happy, and thinks he is among the happiest of men. But he's mistaken, isn't he? He's mistaken, but he's happy. The Snow Queen will retain her hold on him. But couldn't you make a potion that would give me the power to break the spell? I cannot give you a power stronger than that which you possess. Don't you see that animals and people are compelled to serve you? You departed bare-footed and without mishap, you've travelled half the universe. It's not from me that you could receive strength, oh no! The doe will take you ten leagues from here, to a grove of red fruit in the midst of the snow. Pay attention. That's where he'll return to you. No, no. Mama told me it was forbidden. "Don't eat strange fruit, "especially red berries: they could be poisonous, and you could die." Yes, but I risk nothing: I'm dreaming. Yes, I risk dying while I sleep. No, no...I'm too young to die. But if you die while sleeping, you then awake. What are you doing here? Please leave. But first tell me what you're doing here in an old-fashioned dress. I am in my home. And you're dressed in a fashion that is very strange. And you look a lot like Peter. Yes, you look a lot like him. My great-grandfather was called Peter. My name is Johan. My name is Anastasia. I know, it's a pompous name. My grandmother liked it, I don't remember why. You see that I didn't lie. That's my grandmother. But careful, don't wake her. Grown-ups are very annoying. As for little vixens, they're stupid, mawkish and pretentious. I hate girls. But who are you? Peter's beloved. And you aren't Peter. If only I hadn't lost in the exchange... You shouldn't have done that! I'm certainly much younger than you! - How old are you? - 16. My mother had me when she was 15, and my father was the groom. He was very, very handsome. And so are you. But...if I did the same with you, I would waste my youth, because you are much too old for me. But I'm 18. You have strange ideas about the world. That's the way I am. All or nothing. Then it's nothing? Not more than seven today. One... Three... Six... Seven... Eight... - You're cheating! That's enough for today. - It looks like you want it. - No, I don't want it. You know what it's called, a girl like you? A tease. In fact, you're more clever than I thought. No, no. I like to flirt with you. But I'm not sure you love me. It's too soon. What did you do yesterday? I went to school. 15? If you don't cheat! You're wearing a corset? But what kind of creature are you? A woman. Actually a young girl. Your skin is soft. How can you endure these awful stays? To be beautiful, you must suffer. There are some that don't. And they're very beautiful. - More beautiful than me? - Are you jealous? What does that mean, jealous? To fear that I prefer someone else to you. - But it's impossible. - Yes, it's possible. You make me tired, with your funny dress with laces. Mind you, it's exciting. - Exciting? A turn-on. You're a turn-on. But you're also a ninny, pretending you're a princess. But I am a princess! No one dares disobey me! No one dares contradict me! I get it. You're not 16. I am 16! Fine...I'll come back when you're more grown up. Take heed. Perhaps you'll be too old. And perhaps I'll no longer love you! A pretty boy, but I wonder if it's really worth the trouble that you run after him to the end of the world. How beautiful you are, and how I missed you too! You could have stayed with me. - Yes, but... - I know. You love him. And if you love him, you'll cause yourself a lot of pain. You must never tell a boy you're in love with him. I told him that I'd risk not being so anymore. That's better. There. That's where he stopped. I've got the right to go much further, since I'm a girl. It's girls that can teach girls all about love. Really? Often boys are too clumsy, or too much in a hurry. And if they're a little better raised, they're afraid of virgins. You've already had a boy? Men! All those that I liked. Bandits don't make a fuss. That boy who worries and feels the shudder of remorse because you are too young... I slept with a man for the first time when I was 13. If I could have done so at 12, I would have. I think I've got the devil in my body! And how many have you had? I stopped counting. Anyway, what's the point? There are those that count, and those that don't. But...there's also the one who doesn't count anymore. Who is that? He that you loved very much, and now you're apart. Does that exist, being apart from someone you've loved very much? All the time. Anyway...Sometimes you find them again. Look at you and me... I think I love girls better than I love men. They have more mystery. Especially a little girl in love who doesn't know what to do about it. Let me take care of it. With a girl, it doesn't count. Tell me that I'm your friend. Not your little friend... Your great friend. You're the first girl that I've loved. Before, I wanted to be a boy. I hated girls. I wanted my mother to call me Vladimir. And I never wanted to have breasts. Now, I want some huge ones. Everyone's stupid when they're little. Anyway, you had guts. I couldn't frighten you. And the knife? - The dagger? - Yes. - I liked it. I was very afraid, but that's what I liked about it. I've always been treated as if I were made of glass. Here... Look. I've got your watch. I stole it. I wear it always. I thought I'd lost it. You never pay attention. You're so spoiled. - And you're such a thief. - That isn't called thieving. - Pinching. Pincher! Johan, where are you going? This is the third time you've done this. You leave... I don't know...You must stop it now, Johan. We already talked the other day about it. Mama, I'm 17. It's an easy year. I'll get my diploma. I should make the most of it. Afterwards, I won't have the time. But your diploma, you must get it with honors. Exactly, it's the last year that I can goof off. Don't worry, afterwards I'll take my prep classes. Then, I won't time for anything. Agreed, but promise you won't come in too late. And that you won't drink too much, because alcohol, you know. I'm not going out, I'm going to the studio. I invited Paul. All right. If it's Paul, OK. Agreed. But you won't come in too late, eh? Kiss. - I want to leave. - And if I won't let you? You know I could hurt you? That I could kill you? No! That would be a shame. - A shame for who? - For my daughter. I haven't been here in 4 days but I haven't forgotten you. You're lying... You're lying! You're lying! - You'll catch cold. - I've caught a cold! I did it on purpose. Stop! I'm helpless before you. I don't know what to do. Me neither! When you weren't there... I love you. Our story scares me. Why? Because we're too young, the two of us. It shouldn't be so intense, so absolute. Swear that I'm your first and your last. You're the soul of Peter, the first and the last. What's this business about Peter? My absolute, ever since I was little. I've looked for you through the long dream and nightmare of childhood. What are you saying? The truth for young girls. Don't be jealous. Take me to your world. No, impossible. It isn't made for you. It would drink you, it would steal your eternity. Mine, not ours. Ours too. Anastasia... Anastasia. You want me to go? Anastasia? What? You don't want to talk to me anymore? Is that it? I don't know you. I thought I'd go mad when I couldn't find you. You realize what you've done to me? I did to you what you did to me! We were too young, you said so all the time. I want this baby, he's mine! I'll call him Vladimir. It's the name I gave myself when I was little. But you're crazy! You could have asked my opinion! You told me to be reasonable! I was in my fashion! Stop! You're hurting me! You didn't have the right to disappear like that! Do you love me like before? Like before. Only it's after. You see, I go out all alone in your world.
