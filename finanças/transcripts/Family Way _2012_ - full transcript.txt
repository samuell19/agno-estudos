Charlie, hi, we had an appointment. Rutmer asked me to make a movie. For your parents. For their 40th anniversary. - Fuck. Yes. Okay. The camera is rolling. Dear dad, mom. Did you know that one out of three killings... Happens domestically, within the family. Perhaps it's nicer to start off positively. Of course, yes. Dear Arend and Jeanette, you prove that it's possible. A perfect marriage. - They say that love is a verb. Well, family, that's a verb as well. Well, I have a brother. And, well, I had a sister. And now I only have Dick. Dick is my brother-in-law. He was married to Anouk, they got two children... Then Anouk got cancer and now she's dead. Dick had it all and then... cancer. No, edit that one out, please. The secret of a good marriage is to stay surprised. In a child-like manner. And to keep feeding your inner child. And the other one's as well. And to keep looking at each other like... Who are you? Hmm. I am kidding now. But that is what keeps us close. The child. Here. - Until we have one ourselves. Right? A child. Yes, of course. But working on it! Has Rutmer already told that he knows Lionel Richie? Lionel. What a guy. I made him a couple of songs. But, he didn't want them. Cocky.. But I will definitely find someone else. With my figure and intelligence, I sure will. Fortunately, I happen to have a very social job. The Barbapapas, that's a family I like. They're just so together... But also doing their own thing. Charlie? O, yes, you are still here of course. And I am on both Twitter and Facebook nowadays. So, it will definitely work out. Dad, mom, this is her. This is... What's your name again? No, I am joking of course. Yes, you know my name, right? - Sure. Do we have enough? FAMILY IS EVERYTHING I am an easy guy, one that like to joke around.. I take everything as it comes.. I don't have any issues, nothing too difficult.. A triangle is not a circle, that one is round.. Life is nice.. Listen to this! This all cheery and shit! A moneymaker, isn't it? Moneymaker! And he's done it again! What a killer, man! That's me, this is my life it is chill You gotta live your life Life is all you do about it It doesn't have any substance at all, does it? But in the meantime you think that it does. Isn't that brilliant! Hey Winnie. Charlie. I was just about to leave. - I am here for the car. Are you using the car? I have to go to work. Rutmer told me that I could. You know the way? Cut it out, man. Because last time he drove it in the canal, Rut! That's why it's not a good idea. - Win, just think along. If he doesn't make it to Markelo on time there will be no food, hon. Never mind, I'll get a cab. Will you then pick me up with my own car? Can I play you something for sec? - I need to go to work. Just a sec! You gotta live your life Life is all you do about it You gotta live your life I want a cab.. Be careful, okay? - Sure. - I'm serious. I told you: yes! - And will you be on time? And you're bringing the meat, right? - Yes! Jesus. Why don't you go to work. Winnie! Where there will be plenty of people who.. Love to be told what to do! How interesting, that you're so upset. It says more about your own insecurity You know that, right? Win, I was just thinking. - Yes? I think I just stepped in some dog shit, before I walked in. Maybe it's on the carpet, consider taking a look! Hey, Dick! Everything alright? - Yes! Pancake? - Lovely. Coffee? - Coffee! Do you have plans for the weekend? I will be with my family-in-law in a lodge. Lodge.. In Markelo. - Markelo! Yes.. I don't want to be too late. We still have to arrange the whole treasure hunt. Yes. So. Yes, I know, so many things happened to me to be grateful for. Ik have a son, he is so kind and caring. He did an IQ-test. Skipper scored exceptionally high. So he is, he is handsome and smart. So lucky I am. But my husband remains dead. And I try to tell it myself sometimes... But it's still unreal. Misfortune comes naturally, Lucy. Bad luck, distress, misery. Sooner or later, we are all overcome by it. And there's nothing we can do about it. Happiness, on the other hand, is something we can work on. In fact, I believe that happiness is not about coincidence. Of or with God or faith, or I don't know. Happiness often happens to be the consequence of an act. Delightful! Have a great weekend everyone. - Yes, nice weekend! Winnie, right? - Yes. I am Skipper. Lucy's son. Right, hey! I'm here to pick her up. How sweet. Well.. I have to go. Nice weekend! Who's that? - The son of one of my students. He is super talented. - Yes. In his underpants or what? Do you have the wine? Suitcases? At what time do we have to be in the hospital? In fifteen minutes, honey. - Okay. Let's go. I mean, now it's nice. But in one year I'll be done. I mean, it isn't really food. It is mousse and foam And molecular shit. What are you thinking about when I say Bistro? Paris! Paris! Alain Ducasse! Who cares about all this trendy stuff with nitrogen? Charlie? Will you join me? Whereto? - Paris. If I could get something off the ground would you be.. Are you coming with me? Charlie! We'll discuss it tonight. - I won't be here.- O, putain. Here, meat for the family. Marbled. Drive them crazy! And that's why I think now: You know what.. I will do everything it takes to write a spectacular cd. Something that moves and hits you. Right here! You know that people will say: Rut, what the fuck! Yes, maybe it's time for some more depth, yes. Always that smell. - That's the word. I'm all for depth. I will make a song that will make people cry tears of emotion. Well, for example. Can I help you? - It's okay. We have an appointment with Lodewijk. Lo! - O, God, there he is! Zell! Der weisse Engel! How is Vera? And the kids? - Yes, good. Well, old chap.. Give it to me, what's the verdict? Yes. I understand that this news might hit hard. Slow sperm motility? Well, it's more like. Dead. You should, let me explain, see it as... It is.. Dead. Sperm. Well, okay then. There's some other possibilities. Like? Adoption or what? Yes, possibly. Though I was thinking of.. Something like artificial insemination by donor sperm. You mean by another guy? - By a donor, yes. Do you have a brochure about that? - Yes. Okay, let's do it. But we're not going to the sperm bank. Hold on. Take it easy. What are we talking about? This is shit, this. If we do this it will just be like Russian roulette. You'll never know what they put in. If you're lucky you could tell the sperm bank: I would really quite like it if the donor has blue eyes. Apart from that, you know nothing. Like the donor's education. You don't know his social background. Then I could also just have sex with some random stranger. Yes, Rut. I want the best of the best. I want... Nobel prize winning sperm. - Yes, but. And, I will also do it at home, by myself. I don't need that stinky hospital. There's something wrong with me. I can even feel my own ovulation. - Really? Look, they want a child. And it's not as if, now that you're the weak link.. That we should give up. - The weak link? You want a kid too, right? - Yes! Our own. Rut... we cannot simply own a child. A child owns themselves. Grandpa! Look! Who's there! Look who's here. - And here's your sister! Hey, sweetie. Oops, you smell a little like the zoo. Yes, that's possible. Would you start the treasure hunt? Fine. Charlie! Du boeuf. - What? O, yes, my meat. Everything ok? - You are my hero. Well, I think you're scary. - I am not scary. Well.. in my shorts I'm scary. And a child makes you such a complete person in many ways. Rut, if you have that that baby in your arms.. Look what it does to your creativity! Yes, then you will flow. Perhaps you'll suddenly write a beautiful chanson. In French? - Yes, who knows. Look, Rut, my family is shit. I so happy that I can join yours. It's such a lovely family but Rut.. Look at me. I want a family of my own. Dick? Rutmer and Winnie are here! Bro-in-law! Hey sweetheart. You always take such great care of us! Has someone heard anything from Charlie, maybe? Such beautiful teeth you have! So nice when you smile. You should do something about your teeth, Dick. Little effort. Coffee? Burny who? Burny Wiesenthal. That's songwriting. That man has produced many beautiful songs. And for Lionel too. - Lionel? Richie, Lionel Richie. And he gives workshops too! In New York. Did you know, honey? Who, Burny? Really? - Ja. You should go, Rut. Am I really late? - Charlie, moron! So! - I have a dragon with three heads. Look at that, cool! Where's the food? Rut, could you help me? - Of course, man. Meat, meat, meat! Meat, meat, meat! Meat, meat, meat.. Yes, I am really really sorry. - Sorry doesn't cut it. That car is just one month old. What is that? What is it? Yes, the meat, organic! Christ.. Let me see. Do you get this side? Well, Charlie.. This isn't really to eat right? Yes it is. Come on! So, first the head. Give me your knife. I'll stay on watch. Yes, okay. Okay, give me your hand. You'll have to take something. Gross, gross, fuck! Fuck, oh, you.. sick bastard! O, man, this is so good. - Yes? Really, I swear, you should have your own restaurant! I work at one of The Netherland's best ones. Yes, as a carrot grater. - Is this going somewhere? This is your thing, right? You want to cook? Well, what am I doing now? - Yes, this is for us. This isn't the real deal. - You're also working at the zoo. Instead of? - You tell me, India, Tibet. Apeldoorn. - Apeldoorn? What's the place to be, in terms of monkeys? How beautiful! Is that me? No, that's mommy. Shall I take those kids to bed? That little one almost crosses his eyes of sleepiness. O well, I got it! Come here, little monkeys. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams. - Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams. I'll go check on him. No, no, let him. Who cannot face his tears, won't have happiness. That one, I will never forget! How many of those books have you sold? 200.000, why? - Isn't that great! Your success is starting to become all normal. And how are you? How are you, do you have a girlfriend? And what exactly is your function at De Abdij? Oh well.. I do carrots. Oh well, in that sense nothing has really changed. Occupied! - Pardon! About our car. Will you have it fixed? Or are you like.. Yes, sorry about that. By the way. Dick! Tobbedansen! Yes, this is the real world, Charlie! This.. And should I care? - No. No, there's nothing you should, as long as your whole life.. Is all about you and beer and boobs. What the hack? - It seems that you're senseless. What are you talking about? - About your mental awareness. You just seem to be incapable of responding to others. Really respond. I mean it's fine, really, it's all fine. But you know, there's just more to life than smoking joints.. Jerking off, and baking pancakes. What about the pie? - Delicious, really! What if you turn 40? You won't have a family, no children, nothing.. You're also not 25 anymore. What about Arend, guys? He's in the loo for 20 minutes now. Sorry, wait a minute, what are you implying? Well, I just mean that, aren't you also unsure? If this is what it is, if you want kids, for instance? Or else you'd have had them by now. - We can't make children! What? Shit.. Really? Yes.. Rutmer is infertile. Sorry, apparently, someone had to say it. Yes, I think, I read something about it. From who? - Twitter. - Twitter? Did you write this on Twitter? - Guys, how awful! Well, yes, that's life. No, I will have myself inseminated. By someone else's sperm! Yes, so that will all, will all be fine.. Was there any coffee? Unbelievable, isn't it? That illegal sperm, distributed on the internet. Here. This man doesn't mind it at all.. If the insemination takes place the natural way.. But he likes to see a travel allowance. What rhymes with 'soul'? 'Open your soul'.. What rhymes with 'soul'? I don't know! 'Fat'.. 'fat bowl'. 'Bowl'? - Yes, Rut, a big fat, 'bowl'. You put it on Twitter, why would you? Yes, sorry, I don't know I just had to share it somehow. I am quite confused by it, I think. Well, I hope that you'll soon get a grip, this is embarrassing. We're in it together, right? Rut, can I do something? Well, I don't know. Perhaps, a grilled cheese, or so? No, I mean.. Can I help? I just don't know. If we're doing that sperm bank thing.. Then this child won't have anything to do with me. Not on the outside, not like, on the inside. Maybe, you know, that's a good thing. That it's not like you. Maybe you should just, go have fun on Facebook, Dick. Yes? Why wont you go on Skype with Lionel Richie. Isn't the whole thing with children.. That you get to see something of yourself. That seemed so fun to me. A mini-Rutmer. Much fun. Do you want something of me? Do you want to borrow my sperm? What? Gosh, man, that's incest. Don't talk shit, man, that not incest, really. Fresh is different.. But that's what you want, right? I have your genes, your DNA. Hey, Rut, look! Gross! Okay, sorry about it, never mind. Grilled cheese, it is. I dreamt tonight that I didn't have a face anymore. I looked in the mirror, and it was just, empty. Did you call Lodewijk yet? - Win! Listen to me, please! I always pretend I'm tough but deep inside... I am just a little boy. No, Rut, you're 36. And I'm also almost 35! Well you look fantastic, if I may say so. I am talking about my eggs. All risks increase, of a miscarriage or a aberration. I dreamt that I didn't have a face. That means something. About the donor thing. Okay, you should just tell him and explain. I am sure that there's sperm banks for people like us. What's that, people like us? - We need good sperm. We are entitled to it. What are you reading? - An email from Skipper. Skipper, what's that? A kangaroo or what? No Rut, that's not a kangaroo, it's one of my students' son. He's highly gifted, you saw him yesterday. And he sends you emails with all kinds of fancy words? My mom is so much better and it's all because of you. A man who ages too fast, look at his baggy cheeks. How well do you know this beaver? - Jesus.. - What? Yes, this is him! - What? - Our donor! This is him Skipper! That I didn't consider him earlier.. He was right in front of us all that time. Yes, here, I got one! Is he alright? - Yes, why? He's acting like a monkey. How are you holding up all by yourself? - It's been two years. Life goes on. I am fine. Mommy! You fell down? Are you alright? Right.. You fine? Maybe you should just sit down. - Okay, we're doing it. What you said yesterday, your offer. I have.. - Let's do it! I was stoned, you know. No,listen. She has someone in mind. Who? - Yes. A donor! A highly gifted, well-trained.. guinea pig! Okay, but.. - No way that he's going to put his sperm in my wife! If you want to be of value to me. After all those scooters and cars that you crashed. If you really want to mean something to me, this is your chance! But, Rut, even if I want to do this for you. Winnie is never going to like this. I mean, she likes me. No, no, she hates you. You are everything that she doesn't find attractive. You are the absolute anti-christ, you set her wedding dress on fire. That's exactly why it's right, for me, you know. We shouldn't have someone that she likes. It should belong to someone that she doesn't like at all. And really, when you offered me this last night, it was so beautiful. So pure.. I almost start to cry now I think about it. You see? Maybe I'll write a song about it. Or a chanson in French. - 'l'Antichrist'. And she doesn't have to know, we'll keep it between us. It's really manageable now. And there we go! Yet again, another one! You're such a flatass! Yes, smoking at 11 in the morning. With a kid on your back. What? Oh yes. I forgot about her. You forgot about her? Well, yes. - Did he just forget about you? Yes, right? - Are you sad about it? Because it seems quite sad to me, you know Rutmer's sperm. Well, I don't easily lose my balance. There's some people around here, who completely lost it. But I'm happy not to be part of them. Okay, well.. Fortunately enough, right? Winnetoe! Look! I found a rabbit's hole! Yes! Can I pass? Well, where's your rabbit's hole? Hi, dad! Hey, sweet, brave heart! I will all be fine, really, it will! I know. See you soon, right? Bye, Dick! - Bye, mom-in-law! Thanks again! Bye, Rutmer. - Ciao, man. Who were you calling? - Lodewijk. Did you tell him about Skipper! - He has a better solution. Rut, we talked about this.. I know how jubilant you are about this guy, but it's too tricky! You don't know about this man. His mom is crazy. Well, Rut, she's really not. She lost her husband. She's been through a lot. - Crazy, depressed, whatever! Probably this guy is just really genetically predisposed. We can test him. - Do you know how much time that takes? It might take us 2 years. - Two years? - At least. According to Lodewijk there's much more involved then we think. But there's more fit guy out there in donor world.. Who are tested and checked. And they have a family tree and all. Yes, but isn't there a waiting list? - Not for us. But where does it come from? - Massachusetts! Massachusetts? - Ja. Where in Massachusetts? Worcester. Quite far away. - Yes. But then you have something special. Another one! - Good job, dickhead, I owe you one! Are you going to Hurley on Sunday? Hurley? - Hockey. Hey, do you think, that I should continue this? Is there a need for someone like me? - Did you have him sign something, or what? No, I shall.. No, man! He's my brother. Come on! Well. I wouldn't buy a second hand car from him. Well, as if you're being all ethical right now! You don't tell anyone, right? - If you could just pee in here? What? - Keep it between us! - Yes, Jesus! Dick, about that sperm thing. You didn't tell anyone, did you? No, of course not! Charlie... Linda. Linda... Charlie. - Right! The sperm donor. Linda bakes pancakes. Yes.. So! - Though the flour is too expensive. It's more that no one likes them except for Dick, I guess. Bye. - Bye! Bye! If I were you, I would get out the sticky syrup. Shut it, man. And then I look at that pregnant belly.. and then I look at my boyfriend.. And I think to myself: Move it! Move? Away from him? - Yes. We don't belong together. But he's the father of your child, right? No, he's not. Whose is it then? Well, he is the father. But.. He's not the man who's supposed to be the dad. I just imagined it all quite differently. And.. - Could you please just shut it! All morning, you're breathing through your nose so loudly The sound really annoy me. I'm sorry. Leonie, isn't it, that you're just afraid to.. face the responsibility? The one that you face.. If you become a mom? - Yes. And that fear makes you run away. Maybe that's what you've been doing all your life. Which is actually quite a masculine response. Maybe that's true. Is it? So I tell that kid: Stop. Where are you going? And she says to me: I'm a celebrity and just looking around. We can all just say such a thing. But it doesn't mean that you can just walk in the kitchen like that. Well, offended, offended! Why don't we give you some more responsibility! What do you think? - Well, I think, this is quite a responsibility. When you walked in, I didn't think you would stay for long. But, god damnit, you have talent! - Thanks. From next week you'll be sous-chef. When I was your age I was running my own business for 3 years. Discipline, Charlie! Responsibility, guts! Close your mouth. Hygiene in the kitchen is most important. And what about the hygiene in the wine cellar? It's so dusty out there. That's my wife. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. - Sure, yes. There's no kitchen in the world that will hire you. I understand. Dad and I were wondering. If you want to come over tonight? Can't you tell me now? - No, not on the phone. I don't think I can find a nanny. - Take the kids with you. They will find out. Eventually. You think you can get off work? Yes. Easily. This is a joke! - No. It's really serious. What is this nonsense? Why? Since when? Are you two having such a hard time? We know each other for 40 years. There has never been someone else. Well. There were plenty of man who wanted something. I had some idiots after me. But I never gave in. For the simple fact that your father and I had such amazing sex. And still. But yes. It's obviously less exciting than before. Yes, Charlie. Your dad and I have a sex life. I don't see what's so funny about that. I made a freaking movie for you! Why? - For when you have your 40th anniversary. I planned this spectacular party for you. Yes. Well. Then cancel it. You can charge me and dad. Oh yes? And the emotional damage. Who's paying for that? It's actually since Anouk that.. - O no! Not since Anouk! Anouk has nothing to do with this. This is about us, really. We looked each other straight in the eyes. And asked ourselves in all honesty what we still wanted to experience. Well, we figured out. Your dad wanted to.. What did you want again? Well, camping, treasure hunting. Your dad want to go camping. And I well, want to know how it feels to.. Sick! You are sick! I don't want to hear anything! I don't want to.. Did you know about this? I didn't know! - You're nuts! Rut, calm down now. Where are you going? I am walking! Yes these things.. He just can't handle them. Weren't you supposed to work tonight? - No. I am. I am fired. So we can go to the Efteling soon! What did you say? - I'll take them to the Efteling! - No, before. He's fired. Again. I dirtied the wine cellar. I am not surprised. - Well I wasn't supposed to surprise you. I think Rutmer turned right. - Yes! Hey, did you.. Inject? No. Why? Yes. Just wondering if those those should actually be getting a kid. Rutmer is a kid himself. Oh, well. There we go! Every scoop means something. Evert, it's not a competition! It's not a competition. No. - Just take your time. 'Paper here' I wish you a pleasant stay! Well, it's good. We will grow by this. I don't have to grow. - You think you don't. Everyone has to grow. Be careful. - Of course not. That's what this is about. Well, honey, have fun! Yes. It's tough, isn't it? A bag filled with worries. That you happen to take with you every day. Deliberately! Stop right there for a sec. What would happen if you just leave that bag behind? That would make life a lot easier and lighter, wouldn't it? But it's difficult to leave behind things we know so well. Even if it's things that aren't so good for us. Well. Take another walk. I see world peace I see world peace In my crystal ball And what do you mean exactly with 'crystal ball'? Poetic freedom! Peace everywhere What I'm hearing now, is that there's nothing.. Really nothing going on, if you know what I mean. If you write these songs that grab you by the throat. Then no one buys those albums. People want to be uplifted too. But can I hear one of those? A song that grabs you by the throat? Working on it. Can I have a scoop of chocolate ice cream please? Yes. It's part of a workshop. We had to fill it all up with sand. We could decide for ourselves how much. But it had to match. With what we carry with us. As to burdens. Emotional. - Then it's hasn't been easy. No. But it could always be worse. Well. Yes. Well. Off I go. With my bag. - Yes. Good luck! - Yes. Bye. I am going to New York next week. To Burny Wiesenthal, we'll be working on some material. Awesome! - Yes. When I come back, I'll bring you a song. One that makes people cry. Of emotion. 'Cry of emotion..' Or recognition. I'm not sure about it yet. Hey, honey. Okay, I'll call. I just don't know. If it's alright now. Charlie, you don't know what you're talking about. Also with the hassle with mom and dad. You're not being the most reliable at the moment. Don't hesitate now, we discussed this. Winnie and you don't seem to be that steady. Well. Have you ever spent more than 48 hours with a woman? Winnie and I. A child will solve it all. I just want it to be ok. So. Just do it. I'm not home now. - Tell me where you are. Lodewijk will come. Yes. God damnit. It's huge here. Well, get ready for take off! And keep it sterile, for God sake! And keep it warm, under your shirt. I'll watch them. Do you want some snack? Then Charlie will go for a pee. Yes. What are you doing? Looking for a spot. - A spot? This is a kid's place! Leave the park, fool! Can I have a waffle? Look! And some cotton candy, please. Thank you. Okay, thanks. - Thank you, sir Call me Lodewijk. Uncle Lodewijk. Doctor! Excuse me, thank you! Doctor, pardon. Can you see how long that neck is. You see that! So. Was it fun? - It was wild! Well. Come. Well. Now jokes now. It's cooling down. Egoist! You don't have a life.. Which doesn't mean that your brother can't have one. It was the best day of my life. Thank you. Rut! I just turned that off! Well. Come here. And now the pipette. Yes. Do you want to? - No. I'll come sit behind you, okay? Yes. That's good. Well.. There we go! Yes. Daddy! How was it? Fun? Sit down. There's enough. Nee, man. Let me go back to my own life. The one I don't have. - I'm a little dizzy. Well.. Bye. - Bye, Charlie. I really appreciate what you're doing. So you know. 'Good job productions'. What's wrong? - It's not going so well, at home. Shit. You want a 'whine-beer'? - What? It's just.. I understand. Love. That is a verb. I am flying to New York soon. To do a workshop. Why aren't you coming along? Me? - Yes. As a thank you. It's a nice getaway. I'll understand. If you don't feel like it. You've cooked in star restaurants. But Dick told me.. That this might be something for Charlie. Yes, it's small. But no pressure, your own boss. Yes. I think it's very kind of you. This isn't kind, it's because Linda needs help. But also because Charlie can't get hired anywhere, right? Did you tell her? No. Only that you're on a black list. Because you couldn't keep your dick in your pants. Think about it. I am teaching at the mandrills. Yes. What was that? Midas was talking about. Some man in the Efteling. An uncle? He told me that he got all kinds of candy.. And that you were gone, or something? Yes. - Who was that? Lodewijk. A friend of Winnie and Rutmer. Their doctor, in terms of.. Fertility. Yes. How is it going with that? Did you, sow? Well. We did it right there. Actually. At the Efteling? Yes. Lodewijk took care of Midas. While I was, you know. I didn't know he would give him so much candy. This is really.. - And he calls himself a doctor. I mean, children sugar, tooth enamel, c'mon! It's about you putting my kid in danger. I swear. Midas hasn't been in danger for a single second. You left him! - Stop it. - With a corrupt sperm doctor! Who stuffed him with waffles and calls himself 'Uncle Lodewijk'. Dick, just quit it! - You quit it! You should grow up, go make a family! I don't want a family. - Scared! Yes, you're just scared! Scared of love, scared of work and scared of your brother. Dick, take it easy. - Hey, kids, good to have you here. I am Dick and these are the mandrills. The mandrills originally live in Central-Africa. Should I step in, you think? No, do you know what upsets him? He's too afraid to continue his own life. It's all about him! It's 2 years ago! - Tell me if he disturbs you. With his red nose, his cheek pouches.. His glamorous colorful groin and his yellow ocher beard.. Is the mandrill highly attractive to the ladies. Wait. This is about me. Look. He's all ready. Are those leather pants? Gosh, Lo. What are you wearing? I though. We're going to New York. Is it too much? Edgy. Well, honey, have fun! Don't worry too much, okay? l'll make it happen, Win. Something that hits hard. - Yes. What do you think? - No idea. A kiss? Bye. I spent many summers here with the kids. Outside, near the fountain. Anouk always wanted to go in. You know that picture? - Yes, I do. Well. Thanks for calling. How are you? Rutmer isn't doing well. What about it? He's just devastated by you and Arend. Yes. It's his family, mom. It's going to be fine, right? Arend and me?- It's a temporary thing, right? I'm in love. What? - Jeanette, you're kidding! And don't tell anyone, okay? I still have to find out what it means, really. - This has gone too far. Who goes to far? Because the image of me and Arend has changed? That I'm feeling something strange? I fell in love! Why are you so upset? Because.. Maybe it has never happened to you. Maybe you're too rational for that. That's okay. Maybe even better. I don't think you ever had that feeling that you didn't know what to do with yourself. No. I never had that. I like to have things straight. That's nice too. No one wants to lose control. The stupid thing is, Win, we can't control things. Not really. And that's why it can be interesting to just let things go a little. Where are you going? I have a date. Win. Before I forget. Could you give Arend something to do? Why? - Just some jobs. So he's not all by himself all the time. Maybe he could do your administration or something? I'll have to go. Kisses. Say hi to Rutmer! This is it, no? You could also just say no. No no no. This is what I'm good at. And if I can help you with it. - Yes. Can I pay for this month maybe? - Yes, of course. What I'm trying to say is.. Take Lucy. Lucy is probably the most unhappy here. Yet she still stays strong. No matter how desperate her situation is. - But. - Wait. She's in deep for 1,5 year in a no man's land of misery, pain, sadness. A hell. It's really...a hell. He hasn't only lost her husband. But also some basic needs like love.. I'm actually quite happy now. Pardon? Well. I met someone. I didn't speak that much too him. But. When I see him.. Yes. I get happy. Yes. Then.. Then I feel happy. Yes. How nice. Yes. And how did you go at it? I didn't do anything about it. It has happened to me. How are you? Yes. Good. I need a pick up line for a song. Fun! Yes. I am really so inspired. Will you ever write a song about me? Shall I come over? Why? I though: Why not? We never do those kinds of things, right? - No, exactly. Don't you miss me? Love. I'll be back next week. - Yes. Crazy girl. I need to go. Shall we call later? - Yes, fine. - Bye, kisses. Bye bye. - Bye. - Kisses, yes? Bye. Hey, off to the gym? I'll have to prepare. Okidoki. See you later. Yes. Hey. Don't slow down! You're going exactly opposite. Are you still upset? With whom? - With the monkeys. With their yellow ocher beards. Daddy, don't stop! Daddy is done now. She really likes you, doesn't she? Who? - Linda. - Yes. I would make it happen if I were you. I don't have time for that. How are you? I am not feeling like myself. Who are you then? I failed. Me. As a human being. Just.. Failed. Nothing. Who says so? - No one. At least not out loud. We all failed. What. You? Not really! I lost Anouk. Rutmer has dead semen. Your dad is camping on his own each weekend. We are all messing around. Everyone does what they want. But everyone does what they want for somebody. You're doing it for the kids. Rutmer for Winnie. Papa goes on for us. So we're not worried. I have nobody to do it for. Are you really sure? - What else can I do? Yes. No. You're right. Sorry. Sir. What a body, that woman had, right? Fun! - Yes. How is it going? - Bad. I don't feel anything. I'm the only one in the course, I think. Of course you feel something. - I can't reach it. I can. - Get a grip, man! Christ, Lodewijk! - Bugger off, you moron! Jelle. Could you turn off the television? Of course. Dear god. Could you please be more subtle? Are you sighing? You want me.. Shall I? What do you want me to do? Something passionate. But not too wild. You're so tense everywhere. Don't you have something like massage oil, or so? No. - Olive oil also works. Tuscan? Yes. Did you like it? Yes, right? - Yes. Sure. A little short though. Yes. It's also new to me. I never had a girlfriend that was, like. That what? Was my age. Why don't you go home? I want to be on my own. Am I talking to Winnie de Roover? - What do you say? Lodewijk, calm down. No you're not. I don't understand anything. Am I talking to Winnie de Roover, the daughter of Jeanette? What? I had a man jack me off. And now that man is gone and I'm wearing hand cuffs. Please. Sorry, one more time? - They found your mom in a fountain. Please. Just relax, okay? - Hello? Charlie? What if I call my sister? - Charlie? Then we'll try together. - Hallo? Come over. Rut is in New York. I won't disturb your dad with this. Please lay down. I'll be right back. - I'll call Susanne. Susanne? - Then we'll do it together. - You and your sis? Just go. And when you're back we'll lay down here. Naked. Well, look. There is Charlie! Mom? Are you okay? Your hair is so oily! - I will take madam with me for a medical check. Madam, will you come with me? Come. - What happened? She doesn't want to talk about it. Well, okay. Mom. Winnie will take you home, okay? Ja. She can just go home. - I don't want to go home. Arend is not supposed to find out. - Let me take your blood pressure. Well. She could come home with me. - Fine. You hear that, mom? So. Okay. My bike is there! I would actually quite like it if you come with me. It's your mother. Yes. Okay. - Okay, great. Mom, come! Let me get a cup of tea. - It's fine. I want! - Mom, follow me! I'll call tomorrow how you are, okay? Sleep well! Bye. Winnie, I'm off. You'll be fine I think. Damnit! That went a little wrong, I guess. Can you stand up? Well. That looks so much better. And call me, if there's something. You're such an asshole. Come on. Take your coat, follow me. Are you fine? Yes. I think so. I'm good. Here. First aid, to the right. No, we should go to the right. Gynecology. Why are you looking like that, stupid? Don't you understand what's happening? I'm sorry, Rut. You may use it. As an experience. George Michael also wrote a song about it. Sorry. Really. Can I do something to cheer you up? - I'm not sad! No. I thought since you were crying.. - I also don't know why I'm crying. I hate hospitals. Could you stop it? Thanks. Misses and mister De Roover? We are making an echo now. - Yes. Very good. Break a leg. - You can come with her. No. Forget it! - Yes, I would honestly quite like that. You're in good hands. - Charlie, come on! - Why? Because I say so, damnit. - I'm not going alone. Come. We are now making an internal echo. We will use an condom for it. With a bit of lubricant. - Isn't that a bit late? Condom. Shut up, man! - It will be a little cold. But it absolutely shouldn't hurt. If it hurts, please tell me. Are you okay? - Cold. Yes! I see an embryo. Can you see? And do you see that flashing light? That's the heart. It beats. Really? - Yes, definitely. It is now.. 15 millimeter. You've been pregnant for 6 weeks now. Congrats. To you too. He has nothing to do with it, actually. Luckily. No. I said that I am pregnant in just one go! Nurse, is everything all fine? It is 15 millimeter and it has a heart that beats. Is that everything? - Yes. Could you then please let me go? - Ja. Thanks. - So great. Yes. Can I have a bite please? I just really crave something sweet. What? No that's Charlie! - Charlie? Yes. He's here. Why? We had some issues with Jeanette tonight. - What? Why? It's all fine now. I believe. Charlie put her on the bed. But I'm in a hospital now. Call you back later. - Yes. Fine. Are you alright? A bit tired as well. - Yes. I bet you are. Thank you. - I didn't really do anything. Yes. You were there. No, I wasn't. - Yes you were. Come. The key. - Yes. How will you get home now? I'll walk. Okay. Night night. You watch out? - Yes. You are a DICK. - Anna P.S. Susanne also thinks you're a dick. Are you back? Such beautiful flowers. - For mom. What are you doing here? - Coming home. But weren't you supposed to come back home tomorrow? Sweetheart. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? It's not what you think it is! Charlie, put on some pants! Charlie, Rutmer. Rutmer, Charlie. She makes stupid jokes all morning. Hormones, I suppose. - Where is mom? She's asleep. She is not doing so well. - Charlie. On the other hand. He took over that pancake house in Artis, you know? We ate some there with Dick once. Really nasty. - Oh yes. Charlie is doing something really beautiful with it, right? What a scary doll. I understand that it appears a little strange. - It does, buddy! So I can't come to your house anymore? I just don't want anything to get confusing right now. Me neither. Rut. - What? Congrats. On what? Yes. Thank you. What's the matter? - Nothing. How was it? Have you been making something nice? - Yes. I have. Why are you so heated? - Mom? Mommy? You should be easy on her. Have you told her? - What? No. I thought to do it tonight. You'll become a grandma. - I wanted to turn that into a little moment. How lovely for you. - Yes. We are also very happy. Sadly, the child will end up in a family that has turned insane! Honey, I am really sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. No? Well I know. You thought: fuck it all! 'I am 65. The perfect time to challenge my whole life.' 'Now I will go crazy at the last moment.' I won't allow this child, our baby, to suffer from.. These life choices by Mother Superior. This child gets raised in a normal family. With a normal grandma, who is happily married with a normal grandad. I want everything to be normal. How hard can it be? To just act, a little normally. Am I asking too much now? - Where are you going? Rut, lie down please. - No, I am not lying down! I will have to finish an album next week that will make people cry! Another one? - No, thank you. It's all quite fragile now. So don't tell anyone please! But you know what's weird? Someone was looking for you. An ex-colleague, I believe. A bit of a scary man. He wanted you to come to Paris. - Listen to me. Rutmer is acting weird, right? Winnie and I are doing very good. For the first time that I set her wedding dress on fire. Rutmer should actually really applaud that, right? I am the father, right? Really. I think it's better if.. you never say that out loud again, or even think. It's like.. I'm alive again. Do you know that feeling? Yes, but a dinner with your family, your sad, depressed family. You can do that, right? Then we can join you in the happiness. Yes. But I don't know if that, in this phase.. It'd just be very good to know who I am without Jeanette. That I am someone. - That's why it's so good. Now you are more complete, that you're put back into the situation. In which you weren't complete before. That's good. For whom? - For the process. Which process? - Your process of growth. I don't have to grow. What is it with you guys? I just want to be happy. - That's why. I see you tonight. Very nice. How are you? Better, slowly but steadily. - Do you still need this then? Yes.. - You could also be doing something else with your day. Something nice. With someone. A Canta-driver may ride on the sidewalk. As well as the bike path. And free parking. And the turning radius? Never more than six and a half meter. And we also subjected this vehicle to the elk test. Look. Can you see? So steep bridges in the city centre of Amsterdam.. That's absolutely not a big deal. Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What do you think? Yes. I am thinking about the color. Well. I'm thinking about the 'steep bridges'. Let's do a test ride! Misses, mister. There you go. - Can we? Misses, I am only allowed to retire when I've sold all these. Well. There we go. Airplanes. Flying through the night. If you see all those airplanes going by through the dark sky. It makes me really sad. I don't have any idea why. People who walk on the streets with a backpack, all by themselves. Sometimes they're ugly too and it makes me even more sad. If I think of people who don't have parents. For example because they died. In an accident. Or because they're killed. It makes me feel so blue. - Yes. And.. - Yes. That's very sad indeed. Jesus, what's that smell? Has anyone farted? Jos!} How disgusting, gross! What the hack? - Why are you laughing? No, sorry. But. Are you pregnant, or what? Yes. Are you happy? No. But, I mean. What's happiness? Happiness is everywhere As long as you look around Yes. Dad. It's me again. I don't know where you are, but we're counting on you. Well. See you later. Really? But no one is crying. Yes. He is. - Well shut it, man! This is goosebumps all over the place. This goes so deep, man. This is. This is you! Are you coming? Rut. Please put one some deodorant. Good evening, would you like something to drink? - We're not complete, yet. Where's dad? - He doesn't pick up. Well. I am quite hungry. We're not complete, Dick 'Cook'. How nice! To Milwaukee! - Massachusetts. Worcester, where they have the best donors. Look at you. So I guess things turned out pretty well for you. - For you, yes. You smell nice! Is that a new aftershave or what? No. That's just me. That's how I smell from my skin. And you, Dick, how are you? Dick has a girlfriend. What? - No. - Who? No I don't. Why don't you pick up? Do you think we can bring it back? Who? - The car. Of course I'll never be able to pay you back. - I don't want you to. What shall we do? This is awful. I'm not good at this. - Me neither. That why I like treasure hunts so much. I enjoy the feeling of knowing.. Where I should go. That you find a clue and then you know.. This.. This is the way. Did you speak to daddy? - Yes. He's somewhere at the IJ. At the IJ? I'm going! Dad is not doing well. I can feel it. Just let him. He'll come home eventually. - Well then I should be there. I'm going. He needs me. I'm going. See! Beautiful, isn't it? 'Deranged old lady leaves a restaurant in commotion.' What's so beautiful about that? Dad and mom belong together. - Mom has made up her mind. She had a plan. And dad wasn't part of that. She went to sit down into in a fountain! Everyone knows. It went viral on Youtube. - I saw it on daddy's computer. Grandma was all wet. Can I ask something? Yes. Were you happy with you husband? Very much so. - Yes? I miss him deeply. Bye. That's why I think that this party should go through. As a surprise. What a ridiculous idea! - A surprise party? - Such fun! How do you think you're doing someone a favor? - They've been married for 40 years! It's not about that. - No? Sometimes people don't belong together. A surpriseparty. Fine. Sorry. I'm not feeling so well. If you don't mind.. - I'll get the bill! I can pay for my own! I have a job. - But for how long? That's unkind, Rut. So, does it taste well, boy? Look. Here's another one. Are you ever going to ask me out? And if you're not. Is that because you.. Don't like me. Or because you don't dare to? I have two kids. I know that. And my wife is dead. I know that. How about tonight? - How nice! I'd love to. Open your heart, open your soul Show me what made me fall for you Open your eyes, see where we at I am ready, ready to go For a leap in the dark I'm reaching for your hand Look. You're on time. You're wearing a suit, you don't hear me about that. Jesus, how sweet. Man. You really, didn't have to do this. Well.. I'm.. Ginger is in bed. The baby monitor is.. here. Volume up and volume down. See for yourself. Yes. And Rutmer comes by for some stuff. Tell him that I have a box in the basement. Midas, finish your plate, otherwise you go straight to bed. Yes. Ginger sometimes wakes up all screaming. Then you should sing a nursery rhyme. Do you know 'In de Maneschijn'? - Yes. - Yes? Yes? Yes. With the choreography. Well. Okay. And Charlie. Don't go and jerk off here. Do you hear me? No. I'm serious. Well. I'm off I guess. Good. Thank you. - Dick. Yes. Bye. This is necessity Rutmer. Asshole. I'm here to pick up some stuff. Dick is not here? - Dick is on a date. I expect a lot from it. He hasn't had sex for 2 years. - You couldn't imagine that. No. I'm good I guess. Good? Hack! Did I do that? - No, she was already crying. But shouldn't you go check on her then? - Yes. You look beautiful. We had that launch of the cd. - Was it fun? - Nope. Look how sweet. Hey, pumpkin. What's the matter? Hey. Come here. Yes.. Sleep very well now. About that party for your parents. Rut wants you to do something together. Who? - You, Dick and him. Just like our wedding, you know? - Vaguely. Well you didn't really participate. You were drunk. You flambéed my dress, remember? - Yes, now I remember! I hope it's going to be as nice this time. If you take care of the matches then I'll do my best. There will be 60 people. - Yes. I'll prepare something. What do you feel like? It's about your parents, right? - Yes. But I also want you to be happy. I don't look happy to you? Not that much. What's wrong with me? I can't think of anything! I have all I could wish for. - I guess. Then why does it feel like there's nothing that.. Charlie! I think I'm going of the rails! It's not good. I can't have it with the baby in my tummy. Hey. Winnie... It's going to be alright. Really. - Why doesn't it feel right then? I really thought I was fine with the way things were going. But I'm not! And it's not that I don't love the child. I already do. But I feel that something isn't right. I feel that something is fundamentally not right. Sweetheart, it's fine. You're getting a baby. It really doesn't matter where it comes from. What matter is that you're his mother. Or her mother, of course. Or her mother. And the child is simply so lucky to have you. You're so nice. So incredibly nice. It will be just fine. Well. This is strange! I just never really noticed. What? How sweet you are! And that you know exactly what to say. - Stop it now. No. I will make things even worse. Come here, you. O, god. O, god. Yes. This is just. Really the hormones. I read about this. You will eat and cry a lot. But also you will turn.. Frisky! Did you know that? That all of a sudden, you just.. Not that all day I'm like.. This has been the first time. Don't think that I'm.. All day like.. Really. Not! But you smell so nice! A dangerous perfume, bro-in-law! It's still just me. Jesus. Okay. We had this conversation before, right? How embarrassing! You know what? Let's just pretend like this conversation never happened. And then. We just don't talk about it. Okay? - Yes.. - Okay. I can't sleep. You can't sleep? - No I'll take you to bed, come. So. - Will you give me a kiss? Of course I will. Sweet dreams! Are you coming? Yes. Watch out, watch out! Hey, its' fine. Are you sure? What are you doing here? Okay, boys! I asked you something. - I wanted to talk to you. Then I wasn't here and then you spoke to Winnie? - Of course not. You are crazy! You are insane! I would never betray you and you know that. I came for you. I am your friend. What happened in New York, I apologize. But I'm having a hard time. It's my first time coming out. And I've been harshly punished for it. I am not allowed to see my children. I am scared. Alone. I just want you to be my friend. I just feel that I don't want anything to change anymore. I want things to stay the same. That's impossible. That's not life. - Then life is stupid. Was that a party bike? I thought I just saw you being dropped of by a party bike. A party bike! Yes. Yes. That was strange, actually. Look! How cute. I'm all ready for it. I'm all ready for it. What are you doing here? - I did it! What? - Scratch your butt! Paris! I'm starting up a bistro. Everything's taken care of: Location, permits. It's only you who's missing. I can't leave this place. No, I can see that you've build yourself quite an empire. I'm becoming a dad. What? Really? Well. Okay then. Sorry. - No, it's fine. I am really happy for you! A family man, after all. Certainly. Can I take that one? Okay. 10 minutes left. Everyone into the living room! Come on. Yes, come on. Yes. You too here. Come with me. Perfect. Come on, come on. Fuck. Fuck. They're too early. Turn off the lights! Turn them off! Quiet, quiet, quiet. Jesus, it's you. Dick. What are you doing man. Come inside! False alarm, false alarm! Quite a babe, isn't she? - Who? Linda, from the zoo. 5 minutes left! Ladies and gentlemen. Can I have your attention please? Welcome to De Roover's mansion. Mi casa, su casa. That goes the whole evening. We are all wearing these beautiful blue t-shirts. Maybe we should talk? - What? No, man. I forgot about it. Really. It's all fine. Okay. Here they are! Go down. Go down. Down. Down. Down. Lights off! It's like a goddamn fairground. Well. You don't waste any time, do you? - Sorry? I understand. You also want to go on with your life. Alone sucks. Welcome, Linda! Welcome to the family! Thank you very much! Dear mom and dad. You should see marriage as an alphabet. Yes. It's always the same letters. A, B, C, D, E... F. If you do your own thing with it with your vision, then it's unique. So.. This one is for you. The A is for Arend.. The husband of Jeanette. For 40 years now they haven't left the bed. The... B. The B is for bristle... Because that's what it is. Because a life long relationship is is really no easy bizz. The C is for Carma, that's what keeps us close. - Karma has a K. Really? Fuck. D. The D is for Dick and that man.. Is reading this lick. The O is for.. - Waiter! - ..Obstacles, because those are on the way. But not with my parents, because they've never been astray. The P is for.. What's that? - You wrote it. - Passion! The P is for passion. Perhaps cut down the drinking. - Passion lights the fire. The fire of love. That lifts us so much higher. I skip the Q. Because that one makes no sense to me. To the R for Lionel Richie. Because.. I work with him sometimes. I think I should.. What? Take a break? - Yes, I have to eat, I think. Seriously dizzy, all of a sudden. Gross. Gosh! I wouldn't have thought that I'm telling you, but this has to stop. No, no, no. It's really an awesome party. I'll be right back. - I am not talking about your party, Rut. What is it then? What are you talking about, honey? I'm in love. - What? I'm. I'm really really sorry. I'm in love with someone else and it drives me crazy to not open up about it. Someone else? I'm sorry, Rut. I'm really really sorry. I can't help it. - Who? Say what? - I fell in love with Charlie. Damnit! Do you have any idea? - I don't have any idea. It's been the first time that I feel something that doesn't freak me out. Did you do it together? - No, stop it! Did you fuck him? - Really, not. We kissed just once. - When? When you were driving around on a party bike in Watergraafsmeer. I wanted to check on you. Congratulations! Yes. On what? - My wife just told me that she's in love with you. Sorry! He didn't know? Well, how annoying. Herewith. And? Is he also in love with you? I don't know. - Well. Let's ask him. I really think that there's some better moment to discuss.. Well I think that we better discuss this now! That you don't give a fuck about her. Because you don't give a fuck about anything! You don't know anything about me! Anything. So shut up. Fine. I'll shut up. You know what. Look her in the eyes. Tell her the truth. Come on. Tell her. About the real situation. - What? What that? Just tell her, boy. Well. No. We're not going to discuss this whole thing now. You coward. You weak.. coward. You're nothing. You are really nothing. And I'm not saying that it's easy. But we do it still. Because if you. - Jeanette. - I'm talking now. I'm just saying. If know all about a perfect marriage. Anouk and I, that was.. Anouk and I had the most perfect marriage of you all. We were together for 10 years and that could have been 40 years. Easily! Not because we had decided that we belonged together. But because we actually did. Now she's dead. And that sucks. That sucks, Jeanette. And I feel it every day. And you too. And we never talk about it. Why is that really? There were times, that I wish we did. Guys! Guys! No. Get out of my house! I never want to see you again. Fuck off! Do you want to come in? No. Maybe later. I knew it all. I had all the words. I love you. I love you. I.. There. I said it. I love you. I don't know why, really. But it's true. And of course it's because you're beautiful, sweet, hot, funny. And smell really nice. But.. That's not everything. I think there's more.. Just so much more that I. Can love about you. And I can't wait to feel it all and to know.. Why it is that I want to be with you. Because, that's my plan. To be with you. All the time. And then find out that I.. I don't want you to find out. Why not? Because you'll hate me. Hate? Hello? Didn't you get the message? I love you! And I think you love me too. So.. You don't have to tell me. But it would be quite nice actually. It will break the ice, so to speak. So.. Could you please tell me? You're pregnant. What? Whoopsy! With me. What? You're pregnant. With me. I wanted to tell you a lot sooner, but Rutmer wouldn't let me. I don't blame him, but he didn't want you to know. No. But. Sorry. It's from the States. - No. Rutmer made it up, together with Lodewijk. I'm really really sorry. - Don't touch me! God.. - I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought that I. If I knew that you.. - What were you thinking? - I don't really know. Why? Rutmer wanted to see something of himself in it. And? And what? And.. He wanted to make sure that you would get a child with someone That you would never really love. I just don't understand. I just wanted to help. Is doctor De Goeie present? Let me just walk there. - You're not supposed to. Winnie. As you can see. I'm in a meeting now. Is it not working out? No? Well doctor Lodewijk has a solution! This man has a fix. Maybe not in the most legal way. Massachusetts, that's where the magic happens! Lodewijk, you're going to solve this! Let me go, man! This is just a textbook example of how hormonal fluctuations might.. Just let me. Sorry! Winnie! If I had a gun, I'd shoot you! You're a doctor! I did it for Rutmer. - How much did he pay you? You weren't doing it for free, were you? - I was. Why?! What for? - You could have lost your lob, you fool! I wanted Rutmer to see that I'll do all it takes. I.. I have.. You're kidding me. You're kidding me! I love him! - This is a soap! - I still love him. You put it in there, so take it out now please. - I don't understand. You'll have to remove it! You have to solve it! - I simply can't. Otherwise I'll report you. - No you're not. Just wait! I'm going! I'm here for Rutmer. He's in his room. Upstairs. Christ. You scared me! I will have it removed tomorrow. Lodewijk made an appointment. Would be quite chic if you'd be there. Actually I never want to see you again, so I don't mind if you can't make it. Rutmer, I wanted to know if everything's fine? No, Dick. Nothing is fine! No. I thought so. And do you know where Charlie is? I am leaving. Yes. We're not happy. For a very long time. It's because of me. No. Not just you. Yes it is. I did this. After.. After Anouk.. I just.. I just closed. Here. Deep inside and.. I just didn't know how.. And I'm so sorry, really. And now.. Be happy, please. Do you promise me? Then I'll try as well. Why aren't you picking up your phone? - I'm packing stuff. What? Suitcases? Where are you going? - Why are you here, Dick? She's having it removed. She's doing an abortion. Today. I could be co-owner of a bistro in Paris. It's her decision. - It's your child! It's also hers. - Your child together. Is she with Lodewijk? - He forwarded her to the Vondelkliniek. How do you know? - Rutmer. He doesn't want anything to do with it. I'm here for Winnie de Roover. - And you are? - Charlie de Roover. She is here for an abortion. - I know, I'm the dad. Yes.. Has she been treated? She's in the treatment room now. I have to go in. - Do you have some identification? - Now! Okay, Winnie, I will give you some narcotics and then you'll fall asleep. Please close you eyes now. - Eva, here's mister De Roover. God! Is he the father? - Yes. So this is exactly why we do these intakes. And why we explain it. - I didn't invite him! - No chance! I understand that this is a vulnerable situation. But this is highly inappropriate! To have this discussion in the treatment room. I would have loved to talk about something else, really. But I wasn't involved in this. - Now you know what it's like. I don't want to argument, you stay calm. I'll give you 5 minutes, okay? Baby's. Are you afraid? - Not really. All under control? I am afraid. I'm afraid to tell you.. what I'm really feeling. Because.. If I do so, then it all begins. And if somethings begins. Then it also has an end. Yes, it often works like that. So how do you make sure that the end is all good? You can never really control it. - Not completely. No. Did you have good parents? No. They were shit. There you have it! You can't chose your parents. You can chose how you get old. And with whom. Listen. If we just assume. That it's going to fail.. Between us? - ..That it all comes down to a huge embarrassment. It already is, actually. - Correct! Then.. We can at least try? There's nothing to disappoint us, really. We just don't have any expectations. I am already, dreading it. Me too. Yes. Well. Off to a bad start. - Right. We'll see. We'll see. And? She's coming with me. Apologies about the confusion. Apologies accepted. We're going to try it. Winnie and I. It's probably not gonna be successful. If you hurt her in some kind of way. I won't. Really. - Really. If you do that. I love her. I'm off. Everything okay? And do you promise to honor and cherish.. In all faith and tenderness.. Cheers. - Thank you. Why don't you swing by Paris? - Nice.
