Hi, there! Oh, God. Not again. We are best friends because, well, first of all we have so much in common and you tell a lot of better reasons. Well, 'cause whenever I first met you, which was so long ago I can't even remember... When we were like first born. In our mums' bellies! Our mums knew each other and went through our mums' bellies. We were like, "Hi, there!" Yeah, so we were talking and literally I just can't, like, picture myself without her. So, yeah, you're my best friend. I am loved. I am special. I am enough. I am doing my best. We all are. And now we take our ropes and we lay them around us, just like so. And, you know, when we form a circle around ourselves we're actually reminded that we carry with us an invisible boundary. It goes with us wherever we go and no-one enters this boundary but us. It's our very own safe space. And now we breathe in short, rapid breaths, just like we practised in my last video, and for those new friends joining us today that's Episode 253, Making Friends With Hyperventilation. Mm. And before we seal off our practice with 20 minutes of blissful meditation I just want to take a moment to tell you all about Elon Mask, the amazing, deep-cleansing, paraben-free rubber mask. It's highly absorbent, perfect for combination skin and I mean, look, I use them all the time, especially before meditating. I just find that having a fresh face, it really helps me to connect with my body, my inner essence, my core self. And to celebrate SincerelyCecilia reaching 200,000 followers... Ooh, wow! It's still so amazing. Thank you. I'm giving all of my friends 50% off all Elon Mask deep-cleansing masks. All you gotta do is just swipe up and enter the code 'SINCERE' to reap your hard-earned reward. Alright! I love you all so much. Sincerely, Cecilia. I needed this today. The world needs more people like you. SincerelyCecilia, I think you just saved my life. Good evening, Jane. Things have certainly escalated in the... mobilising troops as international tensions rise. Sea levels are rising at the fastest rate in three... I just... I thought I was his pick, you know? Like, I've given everything to him and he just goes with Shazza. Like... Prayer, sparkle, angel face. I... I don't get it. Like I'm such a good person. I don't want to cry. I'm sorry. I just feel stupid, you know? Welcome to Pharm Animals! Udderly cheap, udderly friendly. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Hi. So my mum gets these, like, really big headaches and, um, I don't know if you have it here? Like, I talked to the cashier and they said that like they don't know so like they, um... Basically I just... I need to help her with that headache. Do you sell it over the counter here? That is... That is available, but you'd need a prescription. - Oh, really? - Yes. In the States they just kind of... They sell it. So I need to go to a GP? You're gonna have to get to a GP. - What the actual fuck! - I just... Yeah, I'm just pregnant. It's fine. Here. - Ah, we don't take cash. - Excuse me. Sissy? - Oh, my God, it's you! - Oh, my God. What's it been, like 10, 15 years? It's... It's me, Emma. Emma Quinn? - You remember me, right? - Yeah. I was thinking about you the other day, and now here you are, right in front of me. Isn't the universe just crazy? - So crazy. - Oh, yeah, I know. It's a little embarrassing, right? But I'm just crazy about Fran, my fiancée. You should come to our engagement party. - We're doing karaoke. - Oh, I don't... Nuh, you have to come. You have to come. Give me your handle. I'll send you the deets. Holy shit. 200,000 followers? What... Are you... Are you an influencer? Influencer? Sissy, you're doing really well! Ah... Cecilia. What? Ah, it's just, um... It's actually just... Cecilia now. Oh! Yeah! Cool! I love that. Cecilia. Très profesh. It was so good to see you, Sissy. Sorry. Sorry. Cecilia. Ohhh. Let's make a pact. No matter what happens, we end up in the nursing home together. You're the only person I want to poop my pants with. Now let's do this. Sorry! - I'm walking here! - Sorry! - Fuck! - I'm sorry.

Hi, guys. Welcome to my channel. My name's Sissy and this is my best friend, Emma, and today's her 13th birthday. Oh, my God, is this a time capsule? Your favourite nail polish. And a poster of the hottest man on the earth - Jakey. Who do you want to be when you grow up? Tell all the fans at home. They're dying to know. I don't know. I don't really want to grow up. I don't want anything to change. I want to stay like this forever. Boring! I'm sorry. Let's make a pact. No matter what happens, we end up in the nursing home together, OK? You're the only person I wanna poop my pants with. I am not a sissy. I am not a sissy. I am not a sissy. - I am not a sissy. - Hey. I'm not a sissy. I'm not a sissy. I'm not a sissy. - I'm not a sissy. - Who are you? I'm not a sissy. It's not my fault. Oh! Ahh! Shit! I am loved. I am special. I am enough. I am trying my best. We all are. - Hey! - Oh, Cecilia! Do you know how to drive stick? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can. - Of course. - Keys. Thank you. - Right. - Hurry up, Franny! OK, well, if y'all helped me I would have been in the car five minutes ago. I'm so sorry for being disabled and not be able to help you. It's such a hard life for you, isn't it? - Hey. - Hey. I'm really glad you came. Shhh! Ooh! - Shut the fuck up. - What? Shut up! What, what? What - Oh, Alex just sent me a photo of where we're staying and it's like, "This is your vacation home." Like, what is her life? Um, Alex? Yeah, ah, Alex Kutis. Didn't y'all go to school together? Come on, Sissy, don't be a sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. - Sissy, the sissy. - I'm not a sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. - Sissy... - Watch out! What the fuck was that? I think it was a roo! Get out the car. Get out front. Is anyone hurt? I'm a vegan, guys. - This is really not cool. - Oh, shit, my neck! Come on. Oh. This is so fucked. Will someone please finish it off? I... I don't suppose anyone has a gun? We're in Australia, babe. We drive back over shit here. Where's the keys? Cecilia? Cecilia. Keys. - But it... it's still alive. - Barely. Look, it's the humane thing to do. My dad is selling this car next week. - He's gonna be so pissed! - It's a shitty Tarago. Couldn't be worth more than $200 anyway. Oh, my God, this is gorgeous! Wow! My God, it's so beautiful! I wanna fuck this house. - Bitch, we're here! - We're here! Alex, can I please have intercourse with your house? Yeah, if you don't mind. I wanna come inside. Oh! Yeah, let's do it! OK. This is so beautiful! Let us in! Hey. Um... Pussy! G... G'day. Sissy? Um... Ah, yeah, you know, it's actually Cecilia now. Yeah, how crazy is this? I ran into Cecilia yesterday, right, at the pharmacy, and then I invited... Alex. Alex! Um, Alex? Ow, my hand. Um, she, um... What just happened? Awkward! Oh, this is cute. Shut up! I'm so sorry. I didn't, honestly... - She's crazy. - I know. I fucking hate her. I didn't think she'd actually come. I forgot I invited her. She's a psycho. Oh, fuck! That was great. They're gonna love it. She has the weirdest crap, hey? She? Why do you have to gender her? Sorry, Cecilia. Emma neglected to inform me that you'd be joining us. Oh. Unfortunately all the beds are taken but you are welcome to sleep on the couch. Oh, thanks. The couch is totally fine. Sorry, I didn't know about the beds. That's OK. Ooh, bitches! Paradise Lost! Are you guys serious? This is the most... THE most commercial, white, privileged bullshit - - Oh, shut it, Saint Frances! - It's an example of how much we've slipped as a society. It is. - Oh, my God, she's so dumb. - Her bikini. OK, I'm just going to the toilet. Do we just like objectify women? - Are they real, though? - They're not real! - Is it, um... - None of these are real. - OK, but I guarantee you... - Is it round that way or...? Half of these girls are sleeping with each other. Sorry, I'm busting, so I'm just gonna... Don't judge him. He's a loser. He's disgusting! You know this is all scripted. Have you guys never done that before? I am loved. I am special. I am enough. I am trying my best. We all are. Yeah, we all are. I'm sure it's like a two-point deal. Like one boob job, the other boob job, you know what I mean? You still gonna do that for me? - No. Stop it. - I'm joking. It was a joke. - "I'm joking." - No, it's not. - You can't make up this shit. - It's trash. Ah, excuse me? Thank you. Thank you. And the gaslighting this season is like the crème de la crme. Hey, so I just wanted to make a little speech. - It's artistry. - Of course it is. It's so good. It's just like... Emma? - It's not! - It's beautifully scripted. - It's the best writing ever! - Hey, Emma! - Sorry. - Hey. Sorry. Um, I, ah, I got you this. Well, I... I mean it's, ah... I guess it's an early wedding present. Something old. Is this our time capsule? Oh, my God, I totally forgot about this! Oh, Cecilia! This is amazing. This is like that Britney Spears movie where they bury their dreams in a box before they get their period but by prom they hate each other and one of them gets knocked up and wants to paddle in the Pacific 'cause her life's over. - J.G. - J.G.! He's too hot. Do you know how many times I made out with this poster? Hold on, this is the best part. How many times did that make out with your vagina lips? Yeah, that's yours! Fuck it. Hey, guys. Ah, but what about Paradise? I promise it'll be so worth it. Alright? Just... fuckin' wait. Babe! - Oh, my God! - Yeah. I totally forgot about this! - I know! - Look at us! We're so little. Literally I just can't, like, picture myself without her. So, yeah, you're my best - Dinner's ready. But Remy's gonna bitch slap Chloe! But I'm gonna bitch slap you if you don't get your ass to that table because I am really hungry. Yes, Mum. I'm gonna get changed. I smell like rotten cum. Not mine! - Your CEO's maybe? - Don't you fucking dare! Alex! Sissy, don't be a sissy. Oh, my God, Alex, these are so expensive! Happy birthday, biatch! And to Alex, my maid of honour, thank you for hosting us all this weekend. I love you. I am loved. It's the least I could do after missing your engagement party. I am special. I am enough. And your beautiful lives together. I am doing my best. We all are. I'll get down on one knee. I am confident. I am special. I am enough. His married CEO! I'm doing my best. What about you, Cecilia? Are you dating anybody? Oh, nah. Nah, I don't really have time, you know? I'm just like busy and focused but guess that sounds kinda... kinda stupid, right? Not at all. Not when you're as successful as you are. - Really? What do you do? - Oh, I'm... I'm a - - She's an influencer. - An influencer? - Well, um... - That's your fulltime job? Pretty much. She has like 200,000 followers. Fuck off. That's more than Alex. Oh, are you an influencer too? Ew. No. Fuck off! You know Chris Hemsworth? No. No. I wouldn't say I know him, I just promoted his app for a little bit. - And you got paid to do that? - Mm-hm. Yeah. Fucking hell. I'm the least cool person at this table. I've been telling you that for years, babe. So what's your thing? Are you like a model, or... Nuh. No, definitely not. You're like a therapist, right? I'm more like a mental health advocate. You know, basically I just try to help people with their issues. Like what? You know, like confidence, self-worth, self-acceptance, anxiety, depression, OCD. That's really cool. Do you need a degree for that, or... Oh, I'm... I'm not a psychologist. I'm just, ah... well, just a fellow human trying to, you know, share some things that I've learned along the way. How much money do you make? - Tracey! - What? - That's none of our business. - Yes, it is. If she's a public figure and she's profiting from people's pain then that should be public knowledge. I'm not profiting from - Actually, Alex has a point. You're getting paid, maybe not by your followers directly but you're influencing them to buy whatever you're advertising and you're not qualified. Which, legally, is very murky. I mean, what if someone killed themselves because you didn't check your DMs? - Jamie! - I'm serious. Cecilia could get into a lot of trouble. No, I've always been very clear with my followers, you know, from the beginning, that I'm not a professional. Sometimes people want to feel seen, you know? They wanna feel like, um... somebody sees their value and they want to feel loved. So, um... I just try to remind people that they're special. It's kind of like what you do, babe. - Oh. - Oh, what do you do? She's a psychologist. Oh, like an actual psychologist. - No. No, no, no, no. - Wow. I'm not a psychologist. I... have a few years left on my doctorate - so I'm studying to be. - Whoa. - That's really cool. - Thanks. Fran helps real people with real problems - whereas in Sissy's case... - Cecilia... you could argue that those people aren't even like real. Alex, of course Cecilia's followers are real people. - Are they, though? - Alex. No, no, no, I mean, Alex is right. What I'm doing is nothing compared to what Fran's doing. That's incredible. Well, to Fran and Cecilia. The world needs more people like you. Cheers. Cheers. I just... I'm sorry, but I can't help but find it all a little bit ironic. - Ironic? - Yeah, that of all people Sissy is preaching about mental health. Cecilia. - What are you, rebranding? - Alex. Guys! OK. I am enough. I... I am... trying my best. Fuck. The world needs more people like you. I hate myself. Please help. I'm #trying. - Knock, knock! - Hi. Hey. Do you mind if I join you? Whoo! Come on in. The water's great! Are you OK? - Yes. Fuck. - Oh, don't cry. Please don't cry. Fuck. - Cecilia. - I'm sorry. I just feel like I... I've just tried so hard to... to like... to heal and to move on and... Whatever. I'm always gonna be Sissy, the sissy to her. Well, you know what? Fuck Alex. Seriously. Seriously! - Fuck Alex? - Yeah. Do you know how much fucked-up shit she's done over the years? But like this is what I think, OK? All of that stuff that happened between the two of you was a lifetime ago. It was an accident. You were a child. Like you didn't know what you were doing. You are a really good person, Cecilia. Mm. And I'm really glad you came. So I would like for you to stop punishing yourself and just have some fun with me, OK? Yeah, righto, OK. - Do you think it's expired? - Oh my God. Come on. Righto. - Ohhh. - Ahhh! Ohhh. Ooh, still good. You know, you're exactly how you said you'd turn out. Oh, God, really? What did I say? God! Bad dream? I didn't mean to scare you. I just came to get some water. Do you mind if I sit? Go ahead, yep. I can't sleep either. I feel really bad about before. I'm sorry. - Oh, look, that's OK. - Truce? Um... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Truce. You have the softest hands. Thanks. Do you moisturise? Yeah. Um, I use this... this... stuff. Um.. Do... Do you want... Maybe... Maybe you can help me with this. Oh! Thanks, Trace. Look, I'm just trying to change the ionic composition of the air so we can all reduce our stress levels after last night's vibe. Speaking of. Where is Sissy? Her name is Su-sil-ee-ah. Guys. Not today, please? Please? Please? This saviour complex you've got going is so boring, Em. - Saviour complex? - The chick's a total killjoy. Weren't you the one who was gushing about how cool she was? I mean, you've literally never mentioned her and she's invited to our hens'. Babe! I don't have a problem with it. It's just a little weird, don't you think? Actually, Fran, it's textbook Emma. I couldn't stand her when we were kids 'cause she clung to you like a fucking koala. But you were too chickenshit to tell her, so I had to. And we both know how that ended. - How? - Fuck off! Yep. Deadset. - Are you serious? - Hell, no, that was her? She's not your best friend. I'm her best friend. Really? Well, you're not even invited to her birthday party. Alex! What birthday party? Well, it's just... I didn't think you would come. All the girls are there and you don't really get along with them. So you didn't invite me to your birthday party? - I knew it! I knew it! - Why did you invite her? She's a psycho! Oh, my God! Alex, it's not like you're a victim. You were bullying her. Fuck you. OK, OK, OK, let's just chill, team, yeah? Just chill? No, if she's gonna defend that psycho over me, then fuck her. Alex, we were 12 years old. It is time to get over it. You're not the one who has to look in the mirror every morning - and be reminded of her. - Sissy's cancelled! I knew there was something off about her. All that self-help stuff that she spouts? I mean, this is exactly what's wrong with social media. It's a breeding ground for con artists. Like Belle Gibson. Exactly! Sissy's cancelled! Jamie, stop. Can't argue with the clicks, bitch! Baby, where are you going? I'm cold. I'm going back to the bridge. Yeah, me too. OK, well, can you just give me a second? - Are you OK? - Yeah. - I should probably... - That's OK. Go. We need to crack that brie ASAP! I love you. You're lactose intolerant. No, I'm not! Your farts were so rank last night, I literally couldn't breathe. - You're homophobic. - No, dude, she's right. It's like on another level, and I think you should really see a doctor. I don't need to see a doctor, OK? I want my cheese. Just leave me alone! You guys are bullying me. Stop bullying me! Well, you're not even invited to her birthday party. Come on, Sissy, don't be a sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the sissy. Sissy, the... Sissy! I know you're there. Hey! Ooh! It's cold. Why are you here? Um, Emma left me a map. No, why are you here at Emma's hens'? I get that you didn't expect me to be here so you're probably feeling really triggered. And I'm sorry for that. Like I really am. I hate knowing that my presence is resurfacing old trauma for you but wouldn't it be better - if we just put this - - Stop it! Ugh. Stop it, OK? - What? - No-one's around. - So you can just drop the act. - It's not an act. I'm just trying to connect with you. You can't connect with anyone, Sissy. You're a psychopath. Um... I'm not a psychopath. - Say that to my face. - I'm not. Or better yet your followers. W... What, is that my phone? Did you... Did you take my phone? Go on. Tell them what you did to me. Go on. Tell them. Fine. - Alex... - Hey, friends! I have something to tell you about your beloved guru. Cecilia is not as sincere as you think she is. How do I know this? Well, see this scar? Once upon a time, she lost her fucking mind and she tried to murder me. OK, that's enough. Come on, come on, come on, come on! I'm not a sissy! It's not my fault. It's not my fault. - Help! - It's not my fault. - Help! - It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Help! Help! Help! Fuck! Fuck! Alex! Oh, wow. Look at these beautiful trees. And can you hear that? Silence. It's so rare, especially these days, and you know what? Now would be a great time to meditate but first I just wanted to remind us all about the power of kindness. I found this little uprooted plant and I thought why not repropagate it? I mean, it's the least I can do to offset the erosion I'm causing by hiking today. Pay it forward. And, you know, simple acts of kindness are actually known to activate the area of the brain that is linked to improved mood. So keep that in mind. And, hey, don't worry if you don't have a shovel. I mean, that's what our hands are for. Plus, if we get a little dirt under our nails, maybe we'll get a bonus boost of B12. Alright, everyone. I love you. Sincerely, Cecilia. Fuck! ♪ We're hittin' rock bottom with some top models. ♪ Wow. So beautiful. Hello? Don't fuck with me, Trace. My cock's out and I'm not afraid to use it! Hey! Jamie. Were you watching me pee? No. Gross. Nah, I just couldn't find you guys. - What happened to you? - Hmm? Oh, ah... I tripped back there. I stacked it. I went flying. You should have seen it. - OK. - Yeah. I'm really high right now. Right, should we go? Let's go. Let's just... Should we just head that way, or... - Oh! - Argh! Fuckin' piss! Fuck. Sorry. - Here you go. - You're pretty. - You're pretty. - Shut up. Shall we go? - What the fuck? - Oh! Oh, my God! Is that Alex? Hey, Jamie! Jamie, come back! Jamie! Jamie! Hold on! Just... If you just wait one second! Just wait a second! Jamie! You have picked this card today to help you remember the importance of spending time in nature and connecting with Mother Nature's healing energies. Ha. I'll see you guys back at the house, yeah? What? You don't have to leave. Oh, no, no, I really need some me time. OK, well, can you check on Jamie, please? Yes, Mum! Look, the thing that I love most about you is that you always see the good in people. But it's also one of your biggest flaws. Which is why... you always end up feeling this way. You just... You just need to relax. I'm sorry. I can't. I just... I should probably go apologise. Cool. Great. Jamie! Jamie! Hey. Jamie! Wait! Wait! - Wait. - Just let me explain! Stay the fuck away from me! It was an accident! Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise! Alex had it out for me for years, alright. And she attacked me and I didn't have any other choice. I had to defend myself. If it was self-defence, then why hide it? Why not tell us? I mean, I'm cancelled, aren't I? Aren't I cancelled? So why would any of you believe me, even if I told you? Just... Please, Jamie. Please help me. I feel really scared. Um, it's OK, OK? It's OK. I'm here, OK? I've got you. You're safe. - I see you. - Jamie! Hey! Trace- Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Oh! Oh! Ugh! Bitch, Paradise Lost is on soon and I'm not waiting for you! - Jamie! - Alex! Hey, this is Alex. Just text a message. Don't leave me a voicemail because I'm never gonna listen to it, OK? Bye! I'm not a sissy. I'm not a sissy. All hail, queen. SincerelyCecilia, love your vibe, babe. DM us for a collab. You know more guys are coming in here and they're gonna throw their dicks at you. They better. They better fully throw their dicks at me, otherwise I'm actually done. I'm gonna walk out of the house. I can't believe he didn't pick me. - His loss, babe. - Yes. Absolutely. - In your face. That's it. - Fuck, yeah, babe! You got a snack, I got a snack... I mean, I him one time - - Wait, you him? - No, it was before this even - Help. - Holy shit, are you OK? - Help me, please. OK, the magnesium will soothe your body and this should help soothe your face. Oh, my God, I can't believe you're sponsored by Elon Mask. Like, that's amazing. Oh, are you... Are you crying? It's OK. Um... I can't believe she did this to you. When the others get back we'll just hash it all out, yeah? Maybe Alex just needed to get back at you to feel better or something. Get back at me for what? Ah, I don't know. Um... That wasn't my fault. Yeah, I'm not saying it was. So why are you looking at me like that then? - Stop staring at me! - Sorry. Sorry. - Hey, um... - It's OK. Just having a really weird day. Um... I'm just going to... going to get my phone. Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Please can you... Sissy. Ah, Cecilia. Um... You're hurting me. - I'm not who she says I am... - You're really... - OK? - OK. Just... you're hurting me. - Why don't you believe me? - Please let me go. Please let go. - I'm a good person, OK? - OK. - OK. - OK, look. Trace, hey, I'm sorry, OK? I just feel like - Cecilia! Just... Sorry. That's OK. - I didn't mean - - It's OK. - I'm sorry. - Let's just, um... - I really didn't mean it. - Let's just step outside. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Let's get some fresh air. - And... - OK, I... Let's just talk. Let's just talk outside. - Alright. - We'll figure this out, yeah? - Yeah. - OK? Sissy! Sissy! Time to destination, four hours and twenty minutes. Hey! Hey! Stop. Oh, my God. Cecilia, thank you so much for finding me. Dude, I thought that I was gonna die out here. No-one's answering their phones. Why is no-one answering? Whoa! Hold on a sec. I can't get this seatbelt to work. In four kilometres, turn right. Hey, I think the house is back that way, you know? Where's Emma? - What, she's not at the house? - Mm-mm. - Where is she? - I don't know. - Isn't that your job? - Excuse me? Well, if you love her so much then why don't you know where she is? Hey, are you OK? Wait, Cecilia, calm down. Don't fucking tell me to calm down, alright? Calm down? After the fucking day I've had? OK, I think you should pull over and let me drive. Do you have any idea what I've been through? No, I... I don't but if you could just slow down because my seatbelt - I can't get my seatbelt on. OK, but can you just slow down? Cecilia, what's happening? Where are we going? Everything's fucked, OK? That's what's happening. Cecilia, stop the car. It was supposed to be me and Emma, like, that was supposed to be us. That was our pact. Stop the car. And we were gonna make our kids fall in love. I don't know what's going on but could you just slow down - And we were gonna like move into the same nursing home when we were too old to pretend that we cared about anyone else but each other. Cecilia, what's going on? Slow down. I'm here for you. We can... It was gonna be really cute and like... - Like we promised each other. - Cecilia. I just need you to slow down and we're gonna solve this - And we promised each other that we were gonna do that. OK. Just... I really... Stop the car. I'm gonna drive, OK? I'm gonna drive. But I guess none of that's gonna happen now, isn't it? - None of that's gonna happen. - Cecilia, slow down. 'Cause you're gonna fuck off to America and I'm never gonna see her again. - How the fuck is that fair? - Stop the car! I mean, why do you get that kind of life and I'm still so fucking lonely and you don't even know where she is right now! - Fiancée of the fucking year! - Stop the car! STOP! In three kilometres, turn right. Why'd you do that, Fran? Hey! Hey! Hey, it's OK. It's OK, it's OK. It's the... Huh? Huh? It's the humane thing to do. It's the humane thing to do. What? It's the humane thing to do. What? It's the humane thing to do. It's the humane thing to do. What? Phone! Senior Constable Martindale. Is that you, Gaz? I told you to stop calling here when you're fucked off your head. Huh? Yeah, yeah, boo-hoo. Just sober up, alright, ya bloody drunk. And, mate, I'm not kidding. I'm this close to kicking you off the netball team. Ahem! What the fuck are you doing out in the sticks? Ah, this is the Police Department. Is this, ah, an emergency? We've got your location here, mate. Shit. Emma! Emma! Hey, Emma. Now would be a great time to meditate but first I just wanted to remind us all about the power of kindness. Sissy, the sissy! Sissy, the sissy! Sissy, the sissy! Sissy, the sissy! Come on, Sissy. Don't be a sissy. Get it done. Please... Please help me. Alexandra Kutis has killed three of my friends, maybe more. And she's coming for me too. Please, send help. Please. Please. Sissy? Sissy. Sissy. Cecilia. Cecilia. Cecilia. Cecilia? Cecilia! What happened? OK, don't move. Don't. Don't move. Don't move. Just stay there. - Stay there. - OK. Fuck! Alex? Babe? What the fuck! Towels? What the... Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck? No! No! Fuck! Fuck! Tracey! Oh, shit. Shit. Emma, please, I'm really scared. She went crazy. - She... She tried to kill me. - Who? Alex. I'm so sorry. Fuck, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. I mean, if I wasn't here, none of this would have happened. Fuck. Um... where's Fran? I don't know. Cecilia, um... I think it might be time to call the police. No, no, no. Nuh. Mm-mm. There's no time. There's no time. We have to go. Come on. We have to go. Come on. Emma, come on. Come on. Just come with me. Come... It was an accident. You were a child. You didn't know what you were doing. You are a really good person, Cecilia. And I'm really glad you came. So I would like for you to stop punishing yourself and just have some fun with me... We are best friends... OK? Because, well, first of all we are absolutely the same and we have so much in common. Oh, my gosh. We were so young. Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday? So crazy. But you know, the more I think about it, the more I realise, like, time is just a construct. Ooh, ooh, hold on. I'm gonna show you something. Get ready, bitch. It's gonna blow your mind. Do you love it? Matching! Sisters! Pink really is your colour. Hold on, hold on, hold on, shut up! Deep blue sea, baby! ♪ My sister, sister... ♪ What? Oh! You're fuckin' right. Let's get you some nail polish, babe. - Mm! - One second! Just hold on one minute, OK? Did you put it in your bag or something? It kinda just grew legs and walked off! Hey, um, give me a second. Emma? Found it. Great! Still some left. Emma, what - Where's Fran? It... It was an accident. I just... I really didn't mean to hurt her. Everything just kind of spiralled out of control. Please don't hate me! No! No! No! No, no. - Oh, gosh. - Hey. OK, look. I think we can get through this. You're a fucking monster. You're a fucking, psychotic, little, fucked-up monster. You always have been and you always fucking will be. I'm a good person. You said that! You fucking said that! Shit, Emma. What are you doing? Emma, no! No! You're the fucking monster! I mean, did you ever even really like me? Or did you just get some kind of like sick pleasure out of pitying me? You just care so much what people think about you. Can't stand the thought that maybe someone might think you're weird. They might know the real you. Might find out you have a heartbeat or feelings or a fucking soul. I'm real. And if that makes me a sissy, then so what? Great. - I'm proud of that. - Help. I need help. My friends are missing. My address is... Please, I need help. You know, it's people like you that make the rest of us feel like shit. Emergency. Police, fire or ambulance? Police. - Are you in a safe location? - No. No, I'm not safe. Please help, please help. Please come. Thank you. Thank you. Em! Hey! Hey. Are... Are you... Are you alright, love? Mm-hm. Alright, is there anyone else in the house? Alright, you just... You stay there, alright? You... You... You're safe there. I'm gonna... I'm gonna secure the house, OK? And I'll be back. Yep. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Fuck me. You got this. Yeah, you're a weapon. And this is Sissy, my best friend in the whole wide world. This is you when you were a baby! Hi, guys, welcome to my channel. My name's Sissy and this is my best friend, Emma, and today is her 13th birthday. You're officially old enough to be a child bride. Speak for yourself. I'm gonna be so cool when I'm older. - Oh, really? - Yep. I'm gonna have pink hair and drive an old yellow car. Your turn. Who do you want to be when you grow up? Tell all the fans at home. They're dying to know. I don't know. I don't really want to grow up. I don't want anything to change. I want to stay like this forever. Boring! I am loved. I am special. I am enough. I am doing my best. We all are. And now we take our rope and we lay it around us like so. And as always when we form a circle around ourselves we are reminded that we carry with us an invisible boundary. No-one enters that boundary but us. It's our very own safe space and we never, ever have to leave it. When I was the lone survivor of the Alexandra Kutis massacre... my boundary was all I had. When I hid in that bathroom as Alex murdered my friends... honestly, I... I wanted to give up. I wanted it to be over. But then I thought of all of you and I realised I had to be strong. I had to practise what I preach, you know? So I did The Steps. I came back into my body, regained control of my mind and refused to be a victim. And now you can too. Order my new book, Don't Survive, Thrive: Simple Steps to Living Your Best Life. And, even better, all of my friends, all ten million of you, will receive one of my new, bespoke, non-allergenic therapy ropes. Just swipe on up and enter the code 'SINCERE'.
