It's okay. It's a gassy mine so the ventilation arrangement.. ..should be proper. Okay, sir. There shouldn't be gas accumulation. I'll personally come after a couple of days to check. Okay, sir. Okay. - Bye. Hello! Janki di, did the manager come? He didn't even come home for lunch. I hope he didn't go out for hunting. Calm down and eat. He didn't go to hunt. His seniors have come from Kolkata to visit the coal mines. He is busy with them there. He has come. Calm down and eat everything. - Keep quiet. I've complaints against you. You never come home on time and she also doesn't eat if you don't come. How do I keep her alive? Leave her to me. Go and get a cup of coffee for me and save me first. I'll get it right now. Why do you behave immaturely? Why didn't you eat? Why should you bother? Why didn't you come home for lunch? You're always busty with work. I had to go for inspection to the colliery. So, I didn't get.. - Time to come. Right? You're always busy with work or hunting. Shree, hunting is an obsession. I can't live without hunting. What's the use of killing animals? Hunting is an ancient obsession and profession. This obsession helped me hunt you down from Jhansi. What gift do you want for anniversary this year? Just four days left for it. Why are you asking me? Gift me whatever you wish. - Okay. I'll go an meet Chander da. Let me check if all the invitations have been sent out. Relax for some time. You're always in hurry. I won't let you go anywhere until you eat something. No. No. I don't want any explanations. I want to know why we've 100 rupees less from the payment cash. Sir, I told you that my eyesight has become weak. I may have paid someone extra. I know very well that you won't give more money to anyone. Shame! Shame! Will you never change? How can I change? I've become like coal after staying in the coal mine all the time. There's a saying that you can't make the coal appear bright... ..even if you wash it several times.. - Shut up! Deep Narayan has spoilt you. I would've sent you to jail for the previous theft. No sir, you couldn't have done it. You also love me a lot. Great! You know mu weakness. You'll make me crazy. You've drunk again. - No.. no.. No sir, I don't drink now. I didn't drink. Oh! There must be another possibility. I drank alcohol for many years so I must be smelling of it and.. I smelt it. Right? Who named you Sridhar? - My grandma. She raised me. She didn't raise you well. You've grown up to be a rogue. She should've named you Gunadhar (talented one) instead of Sridhar. Forget it. What about 100 rupees? - 100 rupees? Which 100 rupees are you talking about Chander da? Don't ask me. This great fellow will make me crazy. We're short of 100 rupees again. What's the matter, Mr. Sridhar? I always give you 10-120 rupees extra whenever you ask me. Why do you steal? - Well.. Sridhar, you may go now. Put down the 100 rupees as my personal expense. No. No. It's too much. Sridhar should be fired. - No. No. Forget it. You don't understand what I mean. But Chander da, he maybe an alcoholic and a thief.. ..but he took care of the workers when cholera broke out. I know it. He kept drinking day and night and cleaned the garbage. I wonder how can the same person do something so vile. Addiction and gambling can ruin a man. Have you sent the invitations? Yes, I've sent almost all the invites. I'll send the remaining tomorrow as we don't have time. Mr. Chander, why was my slip returned by the cash department? No.. I mean.. send it after 10 am tomorrow. It's not important if I send it tomorrow. Why did you return it today? Do I have to answer you right now? - Of course. Since I've questioned you.. - I'm bound to answer.. ..as I'm your employee. Okay, listen to me. I'm not doing it for you. Is it? Then for what are you doing all this? Are you doing a favor? - No. I'm doing it because it's like a challenge for me. If you can bowl out an expert batsmen with a good in-swing ball.. ..it is great fun. If I can use some tricks and help you become the owner of the property.. ..I'll be similarly happy but.. To hell with you. I can't wait any longer. It's been long. What's the use of getting money at the age of 50? It's doubtful whether you'll get anything. It's clearly mentioned in the will that.. ..if Deep Narayan didn't marry till the age of 40.. ..you would've got half of the property. That didn't happen. I kept him bust with alcohol and hunting for 38 years. He suddenly went to Jhansi and married this middle aged woman. Forget it. Let me tell you why I've called you here today. They've been married for seven years. They don't have any child. Isn't there some clause in the will? Go through it properly. There's nothing to go through. I've to catch the 9:52 train. - No. Take this. Keep this. Have dinner and then go. I'll help you board the Bombay Mail. Go through the will properly and do something. Do something? There's only one solution. I mentioned it to you many times. If Deep Narayan dies a childless man.. ..only then you can be the owner of the property. If he dies? How? Accident. - Accident? No on e can avoid accidents. - Accident. Do you've confirmed information? - Of course. We wouldn't have come here if we didn't have confirmed information. The sambar deer was killed in the evening. - Yes. Fresh blood is still oozing out. We went and saw the incident with our eyes. Okay. Go and speak in the manner I taught you. Okay? We'll do it but what about our payment? - Payment? You'll get it. You'll get it. I'll give you such a generous tip that you won't have any regrets in life. Wait, I'll be back soon. Younger sister-in-law, son-in-law has gifted her this necklace this year. It's beautiful. The design is really nice. Sister, you didn't say how it is. It's beautiful. Brother really has good taste. My dear, don't be angry today. Listen to me. I promise you that I won't go out for a month after tonight. Will you remember your promise? Try to come home tonight. Okay? I promise that I'll come home tonight. You better stay here. Don't leave him alone. - Okay. You go there. Try my new rifle. Anu! Beware! Janki! Janki! What happened? what happened? Janki.. - Are you scared? I saw a nightmare. I'm still nervous. Don't worry. Take the name of lord. Shree! Shree! Shree! Wake up. What happened? Why are you quiet? Tell me what has happened. We're ruined. We're ruined. Why are you quiet? Tell me. What has happened? Tell me. Has he come back? Son-in-law has been badly injured by a tiger. What did you say? A tiger has injured him? He's admitted in the hospital. He's admitted in the hospital? Who? Who told you? Young master. Mr. Chander. Everybody else is there. What have you done, my lord? What have you done? Deep.. Deep Narayan.. Deep.. Chander da! Lie down. Do you want to tell me something, Deep Narayan? Yes. Tell me. I'm here. Tell me. Tell them to go out. Please go out. - But.. I'm with him. - Okay. Deep? Chander da.. - Yes, tell me. Tell me what you want to say. I want to say that.. this is a disgrace to our family. People should treat this as an accident. But actually.. actually.. it is murder. - Murder? Yes, murder. Anu.. Anu.. Anu has murdered me. He had taken out the firing pin of my rifle.. ..or I never miss the target. It was his plan. He even killed Mumru. Evil man. Don't tell anyone about it. Promise that you'll take care of Shree. His evil intentions should never be fulfilled. Promise me. I promise that I won't let anyone harm her as long as I'm alive. But.. - But what? Deep Narayan you know everything mentioned in the will. You don't have a successor after you. I'm helpless. - No.. no.. Listen.. I'll tell you something which no one knows. Are you sure? Glory to Radha Govinda! Glory to Radha-Govinda! I promise you Deep Narayan that until Chandrakanata Chakroborty.. ..is alive, his wishes will never be fulfilled. Chander da.. Chander da.. Deep! Deep! Dr. Mitra! Dr. Mitra! Glory to Lord Narayana! Glory to Lord Narayana! Like the way we discard old clothes for new ones.. ..the soul discards the old body for a new one. If he has a daughter then my second son Late Joy Narayan Choudhury's son.. ..Anugraha Narayan will get half of my movable and immovable assets. But if Deep Narayan dies childless.. ..then my entire property will go to Anugraha Narayan or his son. Mr. Chandrakanta and Mr. Mitra, as per the present circumstances.. ..Mr. Anugraha Narayan is the sole owner of the property. According to the will Mr. Deep Narayan's wife will not only.. ..get money for all her expenses but will also get.. ..a monthly allowance of thousand rupees from the state. I'll apply for a petition to execute the will. Do any of you have any objection? What? Objection? If anyone has any objection, let him come to the proper court. I think we should scrutiny it properly. - Of course Of course. You've a legal responsibility, Mr. Mitra. But it is crystal clear that Mr. Anugraha Narayan is.. ..the only successor of all this property. By all means. Stop discussing about going to court. I take over the charge of the business sand property right now. Mr. Bose.. - Yes sir, what shall I do for you? Don't show or hand over anyone the papers.. ..without my written permission. - Okay, sir. Mr. Das.. - Yes, sir. ..get all the books of accounts to me tomorrow. I'll scrutinize everything. Mr. Suresh, take up the responsibility of cash. Don't pay anyone a single penny without my permission. Is that clear? You can check the cash any time. But I need a proper order in matters of cash. Oh! So, you're trying to teach me law? Okay. I'll take legal help to throw you out first. And.. Mr. Chandrakanta.. - Yes? Do you want to say something to me? Surrender your power of attorney to Mr. Mallick right now. Do I need to surrender it right now? It's better to surrender. Why are you taking unnecessary risk and responsibility? I don't understand what risk you're talking about. You're the ones taking the risk. What do you mean? I didn't wish to reveal the truth before everybody. But since you're forcing me, let me tell you. I think you must've known that Deep Narayan didn't die childless. He didn't die childless? What? What do you want to say? I want to say that his wife is already pregnant with his child. Stop your nonsense. What's the proof? Proof? Shame on you! It is a matter of your family prestige. You know how Deep Narayan died only a month back. Don't you feel ashamed to ask for proof? I know how he died? What do you mean? You were the only one present with him during the accident. Don't you know that he died under mysterious circumstances? Well, you've shared good news. Good. Of course. Of course. It's a good news. You should've revealed this earlier. I would've been saved from unnecessary troubles. But, you took the right decision to diplomatically suppress the information. Goodbye. I'll leave now. You all may leave now. Anugraha, what are you doing? Are you going mad? It's really strange that I haven't gone mad yet. - Be quiet. The game is still not out of our hands. - No.. What do you want to say? Close the door. What do you want to say? Well, Deep Narayan's child may not see the light of the world.. ..and his wife may also.. After all we've blood ties. Have you given up? No, I haven't. I'm going through this mess. The poet has said that blood is a sweeter juice We've drank that. You've to see the end. Yes. I'll. I'll definitely do it. I won't bear such an insult. What do I have to do? Tell me. I'll write letter to Dr. Rudra. Give him 5000 rupees and he'll arrange everything. I must teach a lesson to that swine Chandrakanta. Yes! We must. Come on. Have another drink. Murder? He has been murdered? - Yes. Mr. Choudhury, this isn't enough. I'll take all the risk and do it. And you won't even offer a microscopic portion of your profit? No! No! This is not done. No.. I mean.. I don't mean it. You know that right now I don't have enough money with me.. You may not have money with you right now. But you've money in your bank account. Look, I don't do these jobs nowadays. I've agreed to do this on Kritanta's insistence. But, I must have at least 10,000. Where will we go at this hour? We'll set out tomorrow morning. - No. We must go there tonight. I've been telling Chandrakanta about a doctor for a month. Chandrakanta? Who is that devil? He is actually a devil. A dangerous man. He handles everything in our state. He won't allow any of the doctors recommended by me.. ..to check her. He got scared today and has finally agreed to me. Her condition isn't good and he wants an experienced doctor to check her. I must take advantage of this opportunity. Please come with me right now. Okay, let's go. I must get the remaining payment after I reach there. Only then I'll start my work. Agreed? Why are you so worried? It's a simple case. The case which is very simple to you is the most complicated one for me. I'll explain everything to you later on. - Okay. Bye. Greetings. I assure that I shall perform my duty honestly. Manager. Manager. What's wrong. Sridhar? What brings you here on this stormy night? Manager.. I'm ruined. - You're ruined. What do you mean? Minati's infection has become serious. She is very restless. I don't think she'll survive. If Mrs. Sen could come right now with me.. ..that's why I'm here. But he can't go right now.. ..because I think she'll deliver tonight. Tonight? Then? Okay, I'll send Mrs. Sen to you as soon as possible. You may go now. - Okay. I'll go. I'll go. She'll deliver tonight? But sir.. - Go now. I'll send Mrs. Sen to you as soon as possible. God forbid, if anything serious happens, I'll go there. Minati! Minati! Why are you late? I went to Dr. Mrs. Sen so that she comes here. I got everything but I'm going to lose everything now. Where's my son? - He's here. Where is he? - He's here. Why can't I see? Why can't I see you? Where are you? Where are you? - I'm here. My son.. where's my son.. - He is here. Take him. - Son.. Minati! Minati! Come in. Come in. How is she now? - She's fine. She's fine now. He is Dr. Rudra. He's the manager of our state Chandrakanta Chakroborty. Greetings. Anugrahaha, madam has given birth to a male child.. ..at 3:17 am. - What? What happened? What did you say? What happened? - She has given birth to a male child. - Oh! Is it? That's great news. Yes. By the grace of lord it's great news. Dr. Rudra, sorry for the trouble. Take my car and go back. Why don't I check the patient now that I'm here? Of course. of course. Since you've come, you can go and check madam and her child. Dr. Mrs. Sen is attending them. Come, I'll take you there. Come. Please have sweets. Madam, you must be very angry with me. - Why? I didn't allow you to invite guest for Pradip's birthday. - No. No. I knew that you did it for Pradip's well-being. Yes, you're right. I'm always occupied with the thought of Pradip's well-being. I'm always scared that a mishap can happen any moment. Pradip. Anup. Bless him. He needs your blessings on this day. Bless you, Pradip. Live long. I bless you that you grow-up to be a good human being. Madam, Mr. Deep Narayan wasn't an ordinary man, He was our god. His son will definitely be a king. - Of course. Of course, he'll be a king. - Sridhar, come and bless Pradip. Bless him? My blessing are always with him, manager. Come to me. Come to me. Madam, the cashier is absolutely right. Mr. Deep Narayan was our god.. ..so his son will grow up to be a king. He'll definitely be a king. Definitely. Look what I have brought for you. Anup, come with me. See what I've brought. I'll show you everything. Sit here. Sit here. Sit next to me. Sit next to me. Yes. Sit here. Anup, this is for you. And this one is for you. Look! What's this? - Aeroplane. Yes. it's an aeroplane. Where will you go in this aeroplane? You'll go abroad. You'll go to Germany. You'll be a highly educated man. Mr. Gosai sent me. Anup da, chotoma (aunt) didn't come? The treatments Anugrahaha went through didn't bear any result. He's bed-ridden with paralysis. Sister can't leave him alone. Where's granny? Janki can't walk up and down the stairs. She's upstairs. She's eager to meet you. Come upstairs. Come, Anup. Why are you carrying the luggage? So what? You've just returned from Germany. I'm so happy today. Pradip, come and seek your father's blessings first. What this oblation for? There's a reason. Come on, take it. I want to know the reason. Don't you remember anything? Pradip has returned home from Germany today. Throw it. I dislike this nonsense. You threw it away? - Yes, I did. You and your son are free to run after them for their money.. Don't take their name before me. You've ruined your son's life too. God has blessed me in one aspect. Anup is not like you. How can he be? A tiger doesn't give birth to a fox. Sometimes I feel that he is not my son. - Shut up! You don't feel ashamed to say anything. God has punished you. You're bed-ridden with paralysis. Yet you haven't given up your evil ways. It'll end.. it'll end the day Pradip.. Get out. Get out. Get out of my room. Never come to my room. Get out. Come in. come in. Sit on this chair. No, uncle. You deserve to sit on that chair. No.. I won't sit on that chair anymore. You'll sit on it. Mr. Dasgupta, all the departmental heads.. ..with whom we interact all the time and.. ..introduce them to Pradip. - Okay. Mr. Mukherjee, get the summary balance sheet and.. ..inventory files of the last seven years of Choudhury company.. ..and explain it to Pardip. Why do you want me to take charge when you're here? You need to handle them when I'm not here. So, I want to explain everything to you. Come, I'll introduce you to all the departments. Come. Taxi! Taxi! It went away. Taxi! Taxi! I'll note down your number. Taxi! Taxi! Murder. Attempt to murder. Why are they given license? Excuse me. I'm extremely sorry. Please forgive me. - I won't forgive you. Ms. Shikha, wait here, I'll get a taxi. - No. No. Please listen to me. - Shut up! No.. I mean.. it was an accident. But, you've ruined me. Listen to me. Listen to me. How did I ruin you? You couldn't go where you were scheduled to go. Right? I can drop you there in my car. - You don't have to. You may leave. Who is it? You? - Yes.. It's me. You? What do you want? - What do I want? I'm waiting for someone. Who are you waiting for? - Well.. I don't know her name. Oh! So, you don't know her name and yet you're waiting for her? Great! - Yes. no.. I mean.. it's not my matter, it's ours.. Oh! But, you can't impress anybody with your car. No. No. I'm not trying to impress anybody with my car. What are you saying? You understood what I mean. No, I don't. You don't know her name and yet you're waiting for her. You've entered the house and are peeping around. What's your intention? - Intention? What do you mean? Why are you quiet? Tell me. &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; &quot;If the clouds thunder and the lightening scares.&quot; &quot;If the clouds thunder and the lightening scares.&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why does your eyes glow with the lightening?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; &quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot; &quot;Why do you whisper in my ears?&quot; &quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot; &quot;Why do you whisper in my ears, oh rains?&quot; &quot;You've desires to get lost.&quot; &quot;You lose everything in the storm.&quot; &quot;You've desires to get lost.&quot; &quot;You lose everything in the storm.&quot; &quot;Why do you touch me with your hands, oh rains?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; &quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot; &quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot; Sunanda.. - Yes. ..the gentleman drives really well. Isn't it? Is it written in your book? You're reading it so attentively. No. it's not written in my book. But, suddenly the thought struck me. I was feeling very scared. He drives so fast. I was also scared. But his handsome visage assured me. He's very smart. Isn't it? - Yes, right. But more than his appearance his way of speaking is smarter. The young boys speak with such attitude with girls. I can't tolerate them. Look.. look, I'm very sick. Don't call me whenever you want to.. who? Who is speaking? Well.. I can't reveal my name. I've met you for the first time today. Who are you talking to for such a long time? It's the fellow with mart appearance. - Oh! How did you get my telephone number? People are going to the moon and I can't even get a telephone number? Well, I loved your song. He's very smart. All boys are the same. Why are you shouting? He'll hear you. You don't have any sense. Look.. I sing so that I can entertain people. I feel blessed if people like my song. Just listening to the song isn't enough. Our eyes and ears go hand in hand. The entire effort fails if one of the senses are deprived. How can I satisfy you? - Shall I tell you? Okay, I'll tell you. But don't get angry like your friend. Oh! No. No. I won't get angry. That's enough. I just wanted you to assure me that I wouldn't be handed over.. ..to the police if I visit you. I'm going out of station day after tomorrow. I'll come back and meet you. Yes, do that. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Whose music will gratify your eyes and ears? Well Anu da.. - You can speak from there. An interesting incident happened today. What happened? It was like a drama scene. - Drama? Yes, I can understand. The hero is right before me. Who is the heroine? Well.. - Brother, let me tell you something. You can't start a drama anywhere you want. - Why? You must follow some rules. For example, she should be of the same caste, proper gotra, ..the horoscopes should match. - To hell with your horoscope. Listen to my story first. - Yes. yes. Tell me. I must listen to your story. I'll hear your story. After all I've to arrange everything. You've to manage everything. Manage what? If my family finds out, they will.. I've already invited him home. - So what? I'm feeling really bad. He spoke so smartly that I couldn't refuse him. You've invited him home but you didn't even ask his name. How could I ask his name? He said that he can't reveal his name. Strange! What's the problem in revealing your name? We told our names when you asked us. He has no problem in telling his name. We'll be in problem if he tells his name. What's the problem in telling a name? What are you so scared of? No. that's right. That's right. The matter is that.. the matter is that.. ..like that earth that has three portions of water and one portion of land.. ..similarly a man should have little fear amidst courage. That's because it helps in mental development. It makes a man smart. Well, let me tell my name. You want to say your name? Go ahead. Look.. my name is Pradip (lamp) and your name is Shikha (flame). Don't you think that the two names match each other? Your short-tempered sister might think that.. ..I've made up the name. That's all. Why are you blaming me? You splashed mud on both of them. You entered our house without permission and were peeping inside. Did I do anything wrong if I called the police? The incident that day was a blessing in disguise. I wasn't getting a cab. I wouldn't have reached there on time without your help. But, we don't know his name yet. Sorry. It's my mistake. You heard my name. Pradip. Pradip Narayan Choudhury. he's my elder brother Anup Narayan Choudhury. Madam, Mr. Rahu is here. Oh god! Bad omen (Rahu) on the first day of meeting? Well, it's not rahu, it's Rahul.. What? - Rahul. He has added a 'l' to his ominous name. Oh god! Look how parents spoil their children's fate.. ..by giving them such weird names. Why did they name me Rahul? Everybody calls me Rahu. You? Who are you? You? - How did I come here? Accidentally. It was a mere accident. You ruined my day.. I had to take bath after that and.. I took bath and contracted flu. Don't be angry. The Rahu's evil eye can destroy anything. Who are you? I never met you before. How dare you make fun of me? Forget it. Let me introduce him. His name is Rahul Khasnobis. What? You also called me Rahu? Why will I call you Rahu? Listen carefully. Didn't I say that his name is Rahul? Yes, she said Rahul. I've done all the official formalities. Henceforth, Mr. Dasgupta will consult you before taking.. ..any decision regarding the head office. Please don't involve me in these matters anymore. But, how will I manage without your help? Why can't you? It's not difficult. You've raised in a manner so that you're efficient for this work. Mr. Dasgupta, I want to discuss certain things with Pradip. Please leave. Pradip, my son, when your father died he didn't have faith.. ..in anyone except me. He called me to the hospital before his death and.. ..entrusted me with great responsibility. I've been fulfilling it with dedication till date. I've raised you. Please take charge of everything. Set me free. Uncle, I want to be with you for at least 2 years and learn the business from you. Okay, as you wish. One more thing. After my death respect Mr. Sridhar and take care of him. You don't have a well-wisher like him. Mr. Sridhar? - Yes. Sridhar and I are going to Chandrapura day after tomorrow. Come there the very next day because.. ..the place will be inspected that day. I want you to be present there at that time. You can go where you wish to now. What next? Serve the rich fellow with such expectations. Listen.. a rich man pampers his dog and his flatterer.. ..even before they can demand anything. Supporting my younger brother.. ..doesn't mean that I'm trying to flatter him. Oh! Is it? A person without self-respect has a reason to support everything. Forget it. Have you brought my money? - No. I'll get it very soon. From where will you get the money? By begging before Pradip? What other option do I have? We've to follow the clauses mentioned in the will. Shut up! will? Don't mention the will before me. The will is the curse of my life. I've lost my honor and it didn't satisfy my desires. Perhaps.. perhaps I'm going through this punishment because of it. Father, if we expect things that don't belong to us. We'll be disheartened. Oh! Fantastic! You mean to say I don't deserve a share in this property? Well.. will you never follow what I say? You've grown up but you haven't changed a bit. How can I change? I'm an animal like you. Human being change but not animals. Swine! get out. I don't want to see your face. I also don't wish to show you my face. Get out, I say. Lakhua! Keep working. Can we go now? - Yes, you may go. Meet me after lunch. Okay. I'll go back to office and submit the report tomorrow. Well, you're soon going to get good news from our department. Okay, bye. How do you think the inspection went? It's potentially a gassy mine. He has minutely scrutinized everything. He couldn't remark anything after checking the efficient.. ..ventilation arrangement that we have. Our mine is going to be first in mine safety week. Great! In that case the entire credit goes to you. Where are you going? I'm going to meet uncle. Why do you want to go there? I've no work there. But, it's my duty. - Okay, you may go there later. You've an invitation at Sridhar's place today. I'll go with you. What's this sudden invitation for? No.. no.. it's not a sudden invitation. I.. I.. I can't go there today. Srivastava has invited me for lunch today. - No.. no.. You must come to my place today. You must come to my place today. Please pardon me, I can't accept your invitation. But.. what shall I do? It's okay, Sridhar. It's okay. Pradip, today is his wife' death anniversary. His wife died suddenly. His son also didn't survive. We must visit him. You know how crazy he is. Okay Sridhar, Pradip and I'll be there within an hour. Come on, hurry up. We toiled hard for eight hours. Our blood has become water. Sir thinks that we're animals. Yes. yes. What are you saying? Who is it? Oh! No use seeking my blessings. I'm a paralyzed man. But, your heart is not paralyzed. Bless me from heart. But, my heart is poisoned now. Please don't mind my words, uncle. I didn't understand till date what has been troubling you. I've always heard that you have been suffering. Oh! Is it? Okay. I'll beg before you. Ah! Why are you talking like this? Pradip, don't speak to him. Come. - Oh! So, you think I talk nonsense. You're a vile woman. You're right. But I'm not vile, my fate is vile. Come son, have sweets. No Chotoma, I can't eat anything. I was invited by Mr. Sridhar for lunch. I've over-eaten. Who? Sridhar? He's an alcoholic. he's a mere clerk working under us. How could you have lunch at his place? Shame! Shame! You've ruined the reputation of your family. If people shouldn't accept invitation from Mr. Sridhar.. ..just because he's an alcoholic then no one should enter your house. What do you mean? That I am.. I am.. You've brought snacks for Pradip? He won't eat anything here. Don't you know that Chandrakanta has forbidden him? I detest being purposely insulted. No.. no.. that's not true. Chotoma, give me, I'll eat it. - No, it's okay. You don't have to eat anything here. Come with me. - Yes. yes. take him with you. Serve him. You and your son can't stay without flattering the rich. A mother always pampers her son. Why are you getting angry, uncle? Pradip, sent a couple of thousand rupees for me.. ..after you go back to Kolkata. Only if you want to. I will give you. You asked the money, Chotoma didn't. Let's go, chotoma. Where are you? Here you are. Listen to me. Good! How do you know that I need money? What's the matter? Come on, give me some money quickly. Why are you in such hurry today? Don't ask me. I'm in trouble since the past few days. - Is it? What kind of problem? Give me the money. What will you do with money? - I need the money for.. sick.. Sick? - Yes. Who is sick? - My friend is sick. What is he suffering from? - He's seriously sick. Well, he's seriously sick. But what is he suffering from? Well the serious ailment is.. thrombosis. Your friend is suffering from Thrombosis? - Yes. How old is he? - I can't explain so much. Won't you let me meet my friend for the last time? I may not be able to meet him. Come on give me some money quickly. - Okay. Give me some more. - I also need money. Take it from elsewhere. Brother.. - Yes. Are you going to meet? - Whom? Your friend for the last time. - Idiot! I'll tell her. Here is Boroma. Boroma, Pradip is there. Go and meet her. - Yes. Where are you going? - I'm going out. You came home a little while ago.. ..and you're going out again? I've been noticing lately that you don't stay at home. I'm caught in lot of work. - I know. Come and sit here. I want to talk to you. Come. Hello Sunanda! Why are you late? - I'm not late. I'm not late. What's the time? We still have time. Don't be angry. Come with me. I feel lost when you're angry. Don't be angry. I feel lost when you're angry. - Enough! Do you know how much trouble I had to go through to get the taxi? I kicked a fellow down and then go in the taxi. The daughter of the Mukherjees from Bhawanipur.. - Yes. Chandra Mukherjee.. - Oh! ..I've fixed your marriage with her. The girl is very beautiful. - Awesome! She's very beautiful. Did Anup tell you about her? - Yes. She knows music. Well, the amount of ornaments she was wearing.. ..is enough to create music. Are you pulling my leg? You'll be surprised to hear the amount of dowry they're offering. Mother, please spare me. The day Anup da showed me the girl I was already shocked. Don't shock me further. I'll leave now. Hey! Sit down. - No. No. Why are you in such hurry? What important work do you have? Sick.. sick.. - Sick? Serious ailment. My friend is on death-bed. - Who? You don't know him. I don't know him? What is he suffering from? Stroke.. stroke.. he has suffered a stroke. Thrombosis. Didn't you hear Anu da speaking about him? Thrombosis has become very common these days. Thrombosis? - Yes. Thrombosis. His mother must be in great pain. Lord, save him. Pray to lord so that he saves him. I'll go now. - Listen to me. His condition is serious. Anything can happen any moment. I'll leave now. - Okay. Go. Go. - Yes. I've been speaking all this while to a deaf man. No.. no.. I've a lock. I can't lock the door unless you leave. You don't have to lock the door. Your ears have been locked by god. Kanai? Kanai? No one named Kanai came here. Yes! he had come. He had come. - Who? Mr. Pradip. - He is the one who comes. He is the curse of my life. Sin? Who has committed sin? - No one. I've sinned. I have. Oh god! One must be a great sinner if he confronts a deaf man like you. When did I commit a sin? Why do you want to slap me? You won't be slapped. I'll slap myself. I'll slap myself. - What? What did you say? I'll slap myself? Why? I didn't tell you. Why shall I slap myself? What have I done? - Is he going to beat me? You want me to slap myself? - Nibaran.. You want me to slap myself? - Nibaran.. no, Nibaran. Don't come forward. How dare you? Please don't come forward. Why won't I come forward? I'll definitely come forward. I didn't say anything to you. Okay. Henceforth be careful of what you speak. Let me warn you. - Okay. I'll think before I act. Don't delay. Wake up, Rahul. I have to gather courage and express my feelings by any means. I want to say something important. What of Shikha comes? Go and check if Shikha has come. But you must listen to me or we'll be in trouble. I've managed all this while. I hope you understand. I won't take much time. How much? It's okay. Keep the change. Has Seema returned? - No, she hasn't. - Good god! I don't know what's going to happen. Nothing is going to happen, it has already happened. Why are you so worried? Why are you worried when I'm with you? Strange ! Pradip will definitely manage everything. If Pradip says that he wants to marry boroma will be elated. She'll agree instantly. I'm not sure. I feel scared. You worry too much. What's the problem? Why do you worry so much? I'm assuring you. Why don't you understand my plan? I'll stay behind Pradip and get approval to our relationship. Do you understand? Well, remember something. Until I get the permission the affair between us.. - No! We're having an affair. You can't deny it. We're already in a relationship. Don't reveal anything about our affair to anyone, not even Shikha. Okay? I won't say anything to her.. - Very good. ..but, it's very difficult to keep secrets from Shikha. Why is it difficult? She won't find out if you don't tell her. Why should I keep our relation a secret? Well, you need to keep it a secret because.. I haven't committed any crime that I must hide it. - That's right. But the matter is.. you're a coward.. - Coward? You can't even keep a secret? Am I a coward? Or are you a coward? - Yes. Yes, but the matter is.. You're Pradip's elder brother. Why don't you gather courage and say it before he does? Actually courage.. - No.. I don't wish to listen to you. Please don't go away, listen to me. - No. Listen to me. I can say it right now. I've no problem in talking about our relationship. But, I can't because of a fundamental problem. What is it? - What? You don't know how mischievous Pradip is. If he finds out about our relationship he'll place us.. ..in the foreground and hide behind us. I'll have to manage everything. That's why I was telling you . Why are you so unreasonable? Please promise me. I'll try. - That's enough. But, I can't promise you. You don't have to promise anything else. &quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot; &quot;Why do you whisper in my ears?&quot; &quot;Oh rains..&quot; You? When did you come? A little while ago. Well you.. didn't you go out today? How can I go out? I'm very busy as my exams are knocking on the doors. Slow down, madam. Why are you in such hurry? - No.. Were you studying throughout the day? I've no other option. I've to prepare for the exams. - You're right. But after seeing your make-up and attire I think.. ..the preparations are going on really well. No.. I mean.. You don't have to explain anything. What's this? - This? Do they distribute the film schedules in every home? Schedule? - Yes. This is it. Look. Look at it carefully. - Yes. I mean no.. Pradip, what do you think? You told the cook that you won't have dinner tonight? What can I do? What shall I do if I'm not hungry? Why are you never hungry? What's wrong with you? You don't even talk to e properly nowadays. Why are you troubling me like this? - Okay. I'll leave for Chandrapura on Tuesday. I won't trouble you anymore. Pradip, what sort of craziness is this? Don't hurt your mother, Pradip. Anup.. what's wrong with Pradip? - Boroma.. Why does he look so restless? Why is he restless? People who are land in this condition go mad. He's at least sane. - Why? Please explain what's wrong with him. How many times should I explain you? You don't try to understand. Didn't I tell you about him? Well, that one.. Don't you understand? - Oh! It's because of it. I'm ready to do anything for Pradip's happiness. But, how can I give my consent to this relationship? I don't have the right to ruin the reputation of your family. Okay, then take care of your reputation. You don't have to worry about your son. You'll regret if he take some wrong step. - What? - Yes. What will he do? Anu, did he say anything to you? What can he say? People don't announce before they take such decisions. I witnessed a incident recently. - What? Day before yesterday.. he applied for a job.. ..in some bloody strange country. What? - Yes. Bloody.. bloody.. which place is this? It's a dangerous place if he goes there then.. What a problem! What shall I do, Anu? I'm trying to convince you since the past few days. Give your consent. Yes. But.. - Boroma.. ..government has legally ruled out all caste discrimination. But you still believe in the caste system. But, she's from a completely different caste. Boroma, let me warn you the last time. If you still stick to your prejudice.. ..then I'll also marry a girl from a different caste. Let me see who stays with you. - Listen.. - No.. no.. Anu, listen to me. Listen to me. - What? What can do if you choose someone? I'll have to accept it. But, I can't live without both of you. That's why I've been telling you to give your consent. You know how sentimental he is. He won't stay here. - No. No. I don't want that. Let him do what he wishes. Let's go and discuss the matter with Janki. Come. You can consult with her but it's just a formality. - Yes. Don't hurt him. Stop reading the magazine. Shake hands with me. - Why? All round success. We've won the semi-finals. Just waiting for the finals. That's the most difficult one. - Of course it is. He is a very serious man of strict principles. But, I'll handle him and get his consent. Well.. well. What about my treat? Hey! Don't act smart. I won't talk to you again if you repeat this. What's wrong in it? It's the oldest and the latest custom in the civilized society. Will you please stop? - Why shall I stop? You won't get a kiss unless we get married as per rituals. As per the rituals.. what about going to the register office.. ..and signing the marriage document? - Sign? No, I won't do that. You can leave me few days after a registry marriage. I wanted to get married as per the rituals of Hinduism. Okay, as you wish. I'll try to suppress my desires until I get married as per rituals. Yes, you have to. When are you going to Chandrapura? On Friday. In the mean time write a letter to your mother and inform her. Mother is coming on Sunday. You talk to her. Oh no! you've high fever. Shree.. come and sit next to me. How come you contracted such high fever? The herbal medicines aren't working. I'll go and call Dr. Majumdar. - No dear. Sit next to me, don't go anywhere. Here.. on this spot. Gas is accumulating in these places. No. no. It's not a serious problem. I think there may be a leakage in a couple of places. Maybe a leakage? I suspect that the ventilation arrangement.. ..has been completely disrupted. Mr. Mitra, the wiring is so old. Why didn't you change them? - No. actually it was working so.. You've taken a risk. Don't you know that a leakage can lead to an annotation and a terrible accident? Well, I'll complete the drawings. I'll get down into the mines and supervise the work. No! No! Why do you want to risk your life? Manager has said that he's going to stop the work. We can stop the work in the pit at that time. No. No. we can't stop the work. We must fulfill our commitment or we'll have to incur huge loss. I think it won't be wise to take such a huge risk. What if any accident happens? Keep quiet. You don't have to interfere in all the matters. I'll complete the drawing tonight. I want all of you to be ready near the pit at 7 in the morning. You're still standing here? Go! Aster.. - Who? Oh Sridhar! Do you want to say something? Well, I want to say.. please don't let him go down pit number three. But Sridhar, Pradip doesn't listen to me at all. How can I stand quietly and watch him face dangers? Please stop him, sir. Please stop him. Sridhar! Sridhar! Get up. get up. Sir, for the past 25 years I have.. Pradip! Pradip! I told you that I'll stop the work in this pit. Why do you've to go down to check? I must visit the pit. He wants to say that.. - Why do you interfere in everything? He has already told you that he'll stop the work there.. ..and it's dangerous to.. Do you want me to explain what I do? Go back to your work. You don't have any feelings for me? You spent seven days working in the middle of poisonous gas. What if an accident happened? I've made arrangements to avoid any kind of accident. Why did you have to do the work. We have employed engineers for the job. What are they for? Just for show? You spent a lot of money to make your son a mining engineer. What was that for? Just for show? I can't win an argument against you. I want to say something very clearly. You were the only one I had with me when I became a widow. I've no one except you in my life. I can't allow you to take any kind of risk. But tell me something, mother. How can I risk the lives of so many people? You are worried for me. Similarly, their families are worried for them. Why did you want me to come back home? Janki isn't well. She wants to see you. So.. - Oh! Why don't you consult a good doctor? What's the use of consulting a doctor? She's n great pain. I just pray that god gives her relief. Pradip, bring the girl home some day. Which girl? Who are you talking about? I'm ready to give my consent to anything that makes you happy. Janki has also given her consent. Bring her home some day. I also want to see whom you've chosen. Mother, I don't want anything else. I just wish I get a mother like you in every life. My son, leave me. Enough. Leave me. Come quickly. There's a trunk call for you. Who is it? A gentleman has called from aunt's hospital. Bring it forward. Hello. Who is speaking? Yes. Yes. Shikha speaking. I'm Dr. Roy from Selco hospital. From the hospital where your mother works. Come here immediately. Why? What has happened to mother? Why are you silent? Please tell me what has happened to her. Your mother lost consciousness this morning. I suspect she has suffered a stroke. - Stroke? Stroke? Who has suffered a stroke? How is she now? Has she regained consciousness? No? Yes. yes. I'll start right now. Yes, immediately. Shikha, why are you silent? Sikha! What happened, Shikha? Why aren't you speaking? What has happened? Tell me. Well.. I'm ruined. - What happened? Mother has suffered a stroke again this morning. I think mother won't survive. Mother! Mother! Mother.. Did she suffer a stroke earlier? - Yes. She suffered a stroke ten years back. I also expected this answer. Didn't she regain consciousness after the incident? No. Mother.. mother.. Mother.. mother.. speak to me. Mother.. mother.. speak to me. What are you doing? It's not right to break down like this. Come here. No doctor don't ask me to leave mother and go. I'll stay next to her. Mother.. mother.. Mother.. mother.. Mother.. - Who is it? - It's me. I'm Shikha, mother, Shikha. Your daughter Shikha. Can't you recognize me? - Shikha! So, you've come? You've come, my daughter? Mother.. mother.. Shikha.. Shikha.. I've always cheated you all my life. I can't die without telling you the truth. Why are you so restless, mother ? Who have you cheated? Keep quiet, mother. Keep quite. - No.. no.. I won't get time in future. Listen.. the identity that you've grown up with isn't your real identity. What do you mean? What do you want to say? Aren't you my real.. - No.. no.. I'm not your mother. Mother! What are you saying? You aren't y mother? - No.. no.. Actually.. we don't even share a blood relation. I've no relation with you? What's my real identity? You come from a very reputed and noble family. You were born into a rich and aristocratic family. But.. but.. - But what? What is it? Tell me everything, mother. Tell me everything. Why can't I see you, Shikha? What's this? Why do I feel breathless? - Mother! Shikha.. Shikha.. I've written down everything in my diary. I.. - Mother! I can't see anything. Everything looks dark. Shikha! - Mother! Shikha! - Mother! Shikha! - Mother! Mother, get up. What have you done, mother? I feel lost. I can't keep any relation with you after this. That's because when you get this letter I would've gone far away. Shikha.. You? If you had planned to betray me then why did you come in my life? You're mistaken, Pradip. I can't cheat you, so I'm going away. Shikha.. ..we're standing at a juncture in our life.. ..from where we can't go back. I didn't wish to go back. But.. but.. fate has forced me to go back. Even a couple of days back I thought that I was very lucky. But today.. - Parents don't stay with us forever. But what has happened that you've decided to go away from everybody? Mother's death has definitely hurt me. But, before death she ruined my life forever. Shikha, if you believe me then please share everything with me. You are the only person I can trust, Pradip. But.. but.. after hearing the truth you may detest me. Tell me.. please tell me what has happened. Lie. Everything in my life is a lie, Pradip. The identity that I've grown up with isn't my real identity. The person whom I knew was my mother isn't my mother. I don't even have any blood relation with her. What do you mean? I've lost my identity not only before you but before everybody. Who told you? Mother.. she told me everything. She couldn't reveal everything to me. She died after saying only this much. Pradip, how do I face you now? I don't have an identity. Shikha.. even if your mother's words are true.. ..you'll live with just one identity.. ..that you are my wife. Who are you? From where have you come? What's your identity I don't want to know anything. I can never forget the honor you've given me today. But Pradip, your mother would like to know who I am.. ..and what's my identity. No.. no.. No, Pradip. I can't ruin your reputation. Forget me, Pradip. Forget me. Shikha, listen to me. Give me a week's time. If mother doesn't accept you within this time.. ..and if you have to leave this place.. ..then we'll go away from here together. Listen.. all of you know that son-in-law.. ..that son-in-law was killed by a tiger. No.. it was a lie. Actually.. actually.. he was murdered. - Murdered? Yes, he was murdered. He was murdered. What? What did you say? He was murdered? Who? Who told you? Son-in-law told me. He said these words to the manager before he died. Who? Who killed him? Speak out. Who killed him? - Anugrahaha. That evil man killed him for his property. He didn't know that you were pregnant. - What happened after that? I had decided that I won't let that evil man be happy. I was ready to kill him if I had to. Why didn't you kill me instead? All problems would've ended. People don't get justice these days. So, the evil wins. You gave birth to a daughter. What? What did you say? I gave birth to a daughter? - Yes. You gave birth to a daughter. - No. No. What are you saying? - Yes.. Listen to me. Pradip isn't your son. Pradip is not my son? No, daughter. You don't have blood ties with him. Then who is Pradip? - I don't know. You were unconscious. The manager brought him here and took away the girl. The lady doctor laid the boy beside you. Janki, I always treated you as my mother. How could you ruin my life like this? I can't even imagine that Pradip isn't my son and.. ..that I've no blood relation with him. I can understand what you're going through. Believe me, I had no other option at that time. Please forgive me if you can. Listen.. I don't want to listen to anything. I don't want to know where my daughter is. Pradip is my son. Pradip is my life. I want to live with him. Never reveal this truth to anybody. Come on, swear on me. But.. but.. I want to tell Pradip about his real identity before I die. Die. Die. I want the truth to end with you. Die, die right now. Mother.. why did you ruin my life? Believe me Pradip, I didn't know anything about this. I only know that I carried you in my womb and you're my son. You've cheated everybody all your life. You want to cheat yourself now? - Pradeep.. Mother, will you tell me the truth? From where did you bring me? What's my identity? Don't I've any identity? Am I a.. am I a.. - Pradip! Pradip.. come.. Pradip, please forgive me. Granny, please tell me who brought me here. What's my identity? I don't know. The manager knows everything. What about the girl? What happened to her? The lady doctor took her away. Who? Who took her away? The lady doctor. Lady doctor? I'll be back soon. I'll be back soon. - Don't go. Don't go, Pradip. Please don't stop me. I've to leave everything to help you. What happened, Pradip? I don't understand what you want to say. Strange things happen in life which we fail to understand. I'm confused, how do I explain it to you? Pradip. - Forget it. Shikha, what has your mother said about your identity? Please share the details with me. Why do you want to know it? It has become the most important thing in my life, Shikha. Or I wouldn't have come and met you. She said that I was born in a very reputed family. I was born in a rich nobleman's family. She couldn't say anything more. I found certain things written in her old diary. The other things weren't legible. She mentioned 10,000 rupees. Colliery. Chandrakanta Chakraborty. What did you say? Chandra Kanta Chakraborty? Chandrakanta? Well.. now I've understood. I've understood everything. Shikha, mother had told me to take you home. Why didn't you tell me earlier that mother wants to meet me? As one part of earth gets destroyed.. The other part is built up. This fact needs no mention. Let's go, Shikha. - But.. Don't hesitate. Come. Look at her. Who is she? I don't recognize her. How can you? You never saw her. She is your daughter. She.. she is my daughter? Mother, you had deprived her from everything. Today she is standing right before you. Can't you accept her? - Yes. Yes. Who is it? Mother.. - Pradip.. You didn't come close to me after that. You've distanced me in a day. Pradip.. - Please let me go now. You know that I'm your mother. Why do you want to go away? What right do I have to stay here? What's my identity? - Why? I'm your mother and you're my son. Don't I have any right on you just because I didn't give birth to you? You definitely have right over me. I don't know my identity. Whatever my identity and wherever I stay, mother.. ..you'll always remain my mother. You'll always remain my mother. Then why do you want to go away? Why? I've enjoyed somebody else's wealth like a thief all this while. If I stay back, nothing van be more disgraceful. I have to go. But Shikha.. what about Shikha? Can't you stay back for her? - No. I've to go away from here for her, mother. I can't keep any relation with her. But, you love her. She also loves you. Marry her and stay here with me. - No, mother. That's not possible. It's not only wrong but it's a sin even to think of marrying a girl.. ..after knowing the truth of my identity. Moreover, I don't have the right to ruin your family's reputation. Whatever, I won't let you go. Mother.. please let me go, mother. How can I live without you, Pradip? How can I survive without you, Pradip? - Mother.. don't get restless. Mother.. don't get restless. Mother.. think about me. I had everything yesterday but I've nothing today. I don't even have an identity. - Pradip.. Mother.. mother.. calm down. Mother.. It may hurt us a lot but we've no other option but to accept it. Okay. Promise me that you won't go anywhere without telling me. Mother.. - I don't want to hear any excuses. Promise me or I won't go away from here. Okay. As you wish. Pradip.. Pradip.. Pradip.. Mother, I'm going away despite promising you.. ..because I'm very weak. What if I forget my resolutions when I see you? So, accept my regards as I stealthily go away like a thief. I hope your blessing always stay with me wherever I am. Pradip.. Pradip! Pradip! Pradip! He promised me and yet he went away without taking anything. What shall we do now, mother? He'll never come back. He gave me back everything that I deserved. And now he went away forever. Mother, bring him back. Bring him back. Yes, I'll definitely bring him back. I'll definitely bring him back. I'm sure that he has gone to Chandrapura. Only the manager knows his identity. He won't go away without meeting him. But.. if he goes away from Chandrapura.. ..I'll never get him back. Never. Let's go. What's the matter? What brings you here in this condition at this hour? Sit down. - No, I'm fine. If it was something urgent, you could've called me. I didn't have the time to do so. Moreover, I don't have the right to call you. So, I came here. What do you want to say? I want to know why you ruined my life to fulfill your selfish needs. No.. I had nothing to gain. I was forced to do it. Who forced you? - Dev Narayan. He made me promise when he died.. Mr. Pathak. Mr. Mitra. Come with me. I'll go down right now. Explosions are still going on. How will you go there? The way I've forced so many people to risk their lives. Water. Why did you stop? Let's go. - Don't go ahead, sir. So many people are waiting for us to rescues their lives.. ..and you want me to stay here? If you're scared you can stay back. I'm going ahead. Water.. water.. Who is around? Water.. He has gone down. He has gone down. Please send me there. Please send me there. Please send me there. - Calm down. Water.. Water.. Sir.. sir, please get my son out. Please get my son out. He has three children. Please get my son back. Ah! Calm down, Kamal. Why just your Bhiku? I'll get everybody trapped inside. If I can't do that then I too won't come back. I'll go down with you. I'll go. I'll go with you. I'll also go. Sir, there danger ahead. Don't go forward. Don't go. Go there, I'll go down and try once. - No. I won't let you go down. What are you saying? So many lives are at risk. I can't sit idle. - No.. you can't go. I won't let you go. You can't go. I'll go. Pradip! Pradip! Pradip! Pradip! No! No! No! Pradip! Pradip! Who is around? Help! Help me! Who is around? Help! Me! Help! Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Help! Help! Help! Help! Pradip! Pradip! No, Pradip! No, Pradip! Mr. Pathak! Mr. Banerjee! Water.. Give me water. Give me water. Water.. - Get water for him. Water. Water.. Water. Help him drink water, Pardip. Only you've the right to give him water on his death-bed. I? What do you mean? Is he my.. - Yes. Give him water. He scarified whatever he had for us. He didn't get anything in return. He should at least get water from you now. Pradip.. - Father.. Pradip.. - Father.. Father..
