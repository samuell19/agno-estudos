"Worried mother." "Bewildered." "Frightened." "Tempted." "Brokenhearted." "Tormented." Don't you ever get any of these things signed, "Radiant." "Euphoric." "Tickled pink"? I mean, there's got to be some happy people left in San Francisco. Not if I can help it. "Dear Kathy Ferguson, "I read your wonderful column every day, "but now I need your help and have no other one to turn to. "Would it be wrong for me to run away with the man I love, who is a wonderful man "but my mother does not like him? "I make my own living. "I want him so much, I cannot stand it another day. "So please tell me what to do. Yours truly, Foolish 17. "P.S. Everything is mixed up because he already has a wife. What should I do?" Well, what do we tell Foolish 17 to do? Forget the man. Run away with his wife. Fergy! Uh oh, here it goes again. What? Nalence. That Dana woman, wanted in Los Angeles for the killing of her husband. Police there got a buzz she's shacking up here with a 5-cent ganef named Giralda. Two L.A. detectives flew in and smoked this Giralda out last night. And the woman? Not yet. You hustle down to headquarters, see the Los Angeles law, whip up a woman's angle on the Dana babe. You know, "I killed him because I love him. I love him because I killed him." You know, the regular dose of Ferguson schmaltz. Tomorrow morning? Now. Composing room. Mr. Nalence. Mr. Nalence, there's a hole on page 10 waiting for my copy. Yeah, we'll fill it in with some of that cornball from last month. Nobody will know the difference. Dietrich? Get me Dietrich. Dietrich, I'm sending you a new lead. Dana woman was seen... The following unassigned men report to traffic: "Benjamin, Verson, Dondy, "Fragala, Holland, S. Holland..." Bester, questioning in the Linder rape. ...Nolan, O'Mara, Quayle, Salicitas..." Coffee and sandwiches for the press room. I don't know. I've been waiting for a half hour. The law from Los Angeles is Captain Charles Alidos and Lieutenant William Doyle. This is sure heavy. Boy, you guys can sure eat. "Pastrami on rye. Jason." Gin, you idiot! "Lox on bagel. Samson." I'm blitzed. Alidos. Alidos and Doyle. L.A. homicide. "Tongue on rye with pickle. Samson." $7. One more? You got me hooked. "Turkey, corned beef, swiss cheese combination on rye with mustard. Dean." I said without mustard. Without mustard? It's good with mustard. So you eat it. Yeah, we're waiting for a statement now. I can't. I don't like mustard. Ha! Snow White! Well, the entire cast. Snow White, all the dwarfs, and the witch. I got here a cream cheese and lox on a bagel. No name. Where's Shevlin? Went to the men's room for a breath of fresh air. Who asked for a cream cheese and lox on a bagel, no name? Hi, Fergy. Did you ask for a cream cheese and lox on a bagel? I guess Nalence gave you all I've got. They're still sweating Giralda. Did they get any more out of him? I think he's leveling. Came in on his own steam as soon as he heard that that Dana woman was wanted. Maybe he's just smart. Well, somebody asked for cream cheese and lox on a bagel. Did you see the two detectives from Los Angeles yet? They're playing coy. We sent word to them that in San Francisco the police talk as soon as the press asks questions. I'm Captain Alidos from Los Angeles. I'm here with my partner, Lieutenant Doyle, to do a job. We were sent by the Los Angeles authorities to find a woman wanted for murder, not to give interviews to the press. When we've found her, you'll hear about it. That's all. Just a minute. You have your work to do, we have ours. Your work should be raising a family, having dinner ready for your husband when he gets home. Alright, already. Somebody ordered a cream cheese and lox on a bagel. "Dear Mary Dana, I write to you from the heart of one woman to the heart of another." "Now you are deserted by him in whom you have placed all your faith and all your love." "When we are alone, "women tortured by fate, betrayed by all men..." "...where can we turn, "except to the heart and understanding of another woman who knows what you're suffering?" "I feel for ya. "I suffer with ya. I want to help ya." "Let me stand by your side in your fight for justice and compassion "in a world made by men and for men. "Call me, Mary Dana, and we will face the world together. "Call me! Call me!" "Call me!" "Call me!" "Call me!" Miss Ferguson, on the phone you said you might know where Mary Dana could be found. Oh, no, Captain. You misunderstood. Not "might know." I do know. - Did she call you? - She did. Where is she? We, uh, we've been reading those open letters of yours. - Have you been reading them? - All right. Where is she? Oh, I'm so glad you liked them. They worked, didn't they? You see, I felt if she were approached with sympathy... - Miss Ferguson. - Oh, I beg your pardon, Captain. You want to know where the Mary Dana woman can be found. Well, uh, before I tell you that, there are one or two things we should agree upon. Miss Ferguson, Mary Dana is wanted for the murder of her husband. There is nothing to discuss, nothing to agree upon. You say you've talked to her, you say you know where she's at, you'll tell us, and that'll be all. Make me. Oh, now, now, Miss Ferguson, you wouldn't want to interfere with our work. Never mind. Miss Ferguson, either you tell us what you know, or I'll ask for your arrest: Aiding and abetting a fugitive wanted for murder. You'll find the Dana woman at that address. I'll pick up a couple of local homicide men. You can stay here with her. I'm not through with her yet. Am I being detained, Captain? You could put it that way. But if you detain me, Captain, I won't be home in time to fix my husband's dinner. Uh, Miss Ferguson, about the Captain, he, um, he gets excited sometimes. He didn't really mean any of that. You're free to leave anytime you want. I know, but you're going with me. Oh? Well, I wouldn't be much help in fixing dinner for your husband. No. But you can help bring the Dana woman in. I don't like your Captain. I gave him the address of an old hook and eye shop. By the time he gets back, you'll have the Dana woman booked, charged, wrapped up, ready for the trip back to Los Angeles. Give me homicide, please. Quick. Oh, you don't need any help. I'll go in first. You make the arrest. It might mean a promotion for you when you get home. I want to talk to Captain Alidos. this is Doyle from L.A. Tell him to call me when he comes in. It's important. Yeah. Well, that's a cute trick. I toss an arrest right into your hat and... Yes, that's very nice of you, Miss Ferguson. But you don't seem to understand. Alidos and me, we're, uh, we're kind of a team. We were sent here to do a job together, and that's the way it's going to be. You won't get very far that way. Well, maybe I won't, but I just try to do my job the best way I can, and try not to poke the other fellow in the eye with my elbow while I'm doing it. Oh, go ahead. This is "Be kind to the Captain" week. Hello, uh, Charlie? Say, Charlie, there's been a little bit of a mix-up. You better get yourself back here right away. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me, uh, who handles you for helping little old ladies across the street? Well, maybe you could manage the job, if your, uh, husband wouldn't object. Not if we let him arrange it with your wife first. There's no problem. Oh? No problem. No? In that case, maybe we better arrange these things ourselves, huh? Have dinner with me tonight? Yes. No, Bill, I don't think I ever will get married. Do you mind breaking that down a little for me? Why? I guess I'm just curious, that's all. The police mind at work? No, no, the police mind is off-duty until I meet Alidos at the airport. Oh, no. The policeman may be off-duty, but never the police mind. You know, I still don't get it. You tell me now, what better ambition than to find a happy marriage, have children and a home? Propaganda. Not for me. For "marriage," I read "life sentence." For "home life," I read "T.V. nights, beer in the fridge, second mortgage." Uh-uh, not for me. For me, life has to be something more than that. Fishing trawler going out to sea, saying farewell. A ship, a man, a woman, all farewells. But it's... it's on its way. Yeah, and so are you, I guess. And the way you turned that Dana woman up... front page. Looks like you can write your own ticket from here on in. For anything you wish. Yes, it does. Doesn't it? Flight 721 from Seattle now arriving... Feeling sorry for her? I've always felt sorry for her. I feel sorry for all people who make fools of themselves. I should think that dealing three bullets to your husband when he isn't looking is more than making a fool of yourself. She just didn't use her brains. Kathy, I've been in police work a long time. Murder always starts down in here, the part that has nothing to do with the brain. American Airlines flight 892 for Los Angeles, now boarding at gate 7. All aboard, please. The Black Maria special. Goodbye, Bill. I'm glad I met you. I like you. I don't think you'll get very far, but you're a nice guy and I like you. Tell me, Bill, how many elbows have you had poked in your eye? Kathy... Passenger John Dunbar. Passenger... Remember me? We came to pick up a package. ...to the American Airlines ticket desk. Sure you won't change your mind? Not a chance. We can match the New York deal. All you can offer is money. Goodbye, Mr. Nalence. I think I'll remember you. Well, I guess the readers will miss you, anyway. Oh, that's all right. Just use some of that cornball from last month. Nobody will know the difference. Goodbye. Gonna be working for McLean in New York. Uh-huh. Know him well. Must be a great newspaperman. Sure he is. Tell him "drop dead." You happy, kid? Delirious. - You don't look so happy, kid. - I'm fighting it. All week long, like you've been hearing voices. "Chloe. Chloe." You know what I think, kid? Don't think so much, kid. It's bad for your work. Yeah. She's going to miss you. Who? Your desk. Oh, yeah. Do me a favor, kid. Use it after I leave. - Sure. - Thanks, Bill. Bill? The name's Sam. Remember? Hello? Miss Ferguson? Yes. Los Angeles calling. One moment, please. Kathy. This is... Yes, uh, yes, I know, I know. Well, how are you? Oh, fine. How are you? Fine. Well, that's good. Hello? Dropped the phone. - Well, here we are. - Oh. Well, I, uh... I read you're going to New York. Um... yes, uh... tonight. Tonight? Well... well, I just called to wish you luck and... Oh, thanks, Bill. I thought maybe you could sort of, uh, stop over in Los Angeles a couple of hours. Have dinner with me? You think maybe you could? Oh, Bill, I would love to. Good. Good. I'll meet you at... But... but I'm taking the non-stop from here... Listen, I'll call the airline and reroute your ticket. Oh, could you do... uh, I'm supposed to leave at 6:00 and... Ah, leave it to me, Kathy. I'm not a cop for nothing. Oh, Bill. - Do you love me, darling? - Oh, yes, yes. Now, with the authority vested in me as a justice of the city of Los Angeles, county of the same, I do hereby pronounce you man and wife. Congratulations, Bill. Oh, thanks. That's the best pinch you've made this year. I wish you every happiness, my dear. And whenever you have your little problems, I want you to feel that I'm your friend. I feel it already. Well, what do you think of the neighborhood? Oh, right now I'm not thinking about the neighborhood. Oh, Mr. Doyle. Kathy, this is Mrs. London. She, uh, she comes in once a week. How do you do, Mrs. London? How do you do, Mrs. Doyle? I wanted to be finished before you... but I can come back next week. Oh, that's all right, Mrs. London. Mr. Doyle had me sew new curtains for you. Oh, thank you. They're lovely. Thank you. Oh, uh, Mr. Doyle, your office called. Robbery Division. They wanted you to call them back. Oh, well, uh, you forgot to give me the message. I forgot to give you the message. That's right. Well... Thank you for everything, Mrs. London. Yes, ma'am. Good luck. Oh, thank you. The beds are turned down. I, uh... I like your Mrs. London. She thinks of the right things. Happy marriage, Bill. Happy marriage, darling. It, uh, it wasn't much of a wedding, was it? Best I ever had. Who are you? - Hmm? - Who are you? I know your name, your age, where you work, and what you do. But I don't know you. What do you dream about? What are your favorite colors? What music do you like? What kind of a little boy were you? How many times have you been in love? No, no, no, don't answer that. I don't want to know. Oh, Bill, I do love you. I never thought I... here I am, with only one ambition left: to make you happy. And I will, darling, I will. I... I just want to be a good wife and do things for you, and I... I hope... I hope all your socks have holes in them, and I can sit for hours and hours darning them. I, uh, I have other plans for you. Oh? You, uh, didn't bring very much down with you, did you? Well, I... I don't think I'll need very much for a while. Thank you very much. Down here is the headquarters desk. Hi. Hiya, Bill. We didn't go in there. Well, that's Inspector Pope's office. He's in charge of what's called the special detective bureau. That takes in a lot of divisions. He's the boss man. Oh! Now the headquarters desk is the 24-hour nerve center. For example, homicide is only on call until 1:00 a.m., but through the desk, why, we work 24 hours a day. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. What happened to Marge in last week's I Confess? She left Sam. For Patrice's husband? For Susan's husband. - No! - Yes. Darling little place. All you and Bill ever need. Oh, I'm sure you'll be very happy. Oh, my, yes. He's a wonderful man. You're a very lucky girl. Yes, very. The captain thinks the world of him. Charlie? Oh, Charlie's a wonderful man. Tom always tells me how much he thinks of Charlie. "Mary," he says, "Charlie is one of the most wonderful men I've ever worked with." Oh, my, yes. You know, the captain gets along very well with all the men he works with. That's why he's so well-liked. Well-liked? Why, the men adore him. And believe me, that speaks well for the wife. You know the old saying: "the apple never falls far from the tree." Last night our T.V. went flooey. Do you know we're getting a new 36-inch? - No! - Mm-hmm. Yes. 36 inches? Yes. Warren thinks I'm going to take the fall. - It's the pension. - Yeah, that's it. The pension. By the way, Charlie, heard anything new about changes in the pension rules? - Nothing serious. - Rates staying the same? Up 2 percent maybe, but it'll still stay 40 percent of full salary after 20 years, 50 percent after 25. I'll do my 20 and take my 40. Mathematically, you're better off doing a 25. - You figure on doing the 25? -Yeah. I only got 15 to go. I think Bill's smart. I'd sooner spend the extra 5 years on the greens, making birdies. It's worth the 10 percent. It's none of my business, Art, but I think you're wrong. Art, you're wrong. Charlie's right. Of course Charlie's right. He's right, Art. You know Charlie's right. Of course, Charlie is right. And that always speaks so well for the wife, doesn't it? You know that old saying, "the apple never falls far from the tree." Hi, darling. I'm sorry, angel. What kept you? - Remember that Kamen squeal I told you about? -Mm-hmm. Well, I figured it was an inside job, so I fixed a nice quiet plant. It exploded this morning. - Good results? - Right down the line. You'll read about it tonight. Oh, my hero. Well, stop looking so pleased with yourself. Let's have some lunch. - Sorry, Mrs. Doyle. - Now what? Alidos, he's steaming, the Kamen job. - Something blow up? - Only Charlie. Just got a call from Inspector Pope for a full report on the squeal. He doesn't know what it's all about. He stalled Pope. He's screaming for you. Wants you in his office pronto for a run-down. It just broke this morning. I'll finish the paperwork after lunch. You know Alidos, Bill. I'd come now if I were you. It's all right, darling. I'm sorry, angel. See you. Mmm. I like cream cheese and olive. I'm getting fat. Pass. I'll take 3. I better get in shape for Alice Pope's anniversary dinner. Alice Pope? She is such a lovely woman. Oh, my, yes. Lovely woman. No airs. Inspector's wife, and all that. No airs. One. When the captain takes 1, I run. Give me 1. Mmm. That cream cheese and olive does look good. I'm getting hippy. Make it the last hand, boys. Yes, make it the last hand, boys. I raise. Stay. Too rich for me. 10s and 7s. Doesn't that cream cheese and olives look good, Sara? Oh, my, yes. Not enough. Made the flush. Clubs. Coffee's on, fellas. Once more around. Do you mind, Mrs. Doyle? Well, the coffee will get cold. It won't take long. Your husband just did me in for a big one. I want a little revenge. Why don't we have the coffee first, and then you can come back? Look, Kathy, it'll only take a few minutes. My deal, Bill. Bill thinks it'll be a lot easier to win when you deal. Yeah, that's right. The Captain's fond of him, you know. He's a wonderful man. I, uh, think I will take another cream cheese and olive. Well, of course, the Captain and I have always been very friendly with Tony and Alice. Oh, that's Inspector and Mrs. Pope, you know. Open. Wasn't that a wonderful story in the news about Charlie and Inspector Pope? Story? The one where the Inspector praised Charlie for his wonderful work on the Kamen job. Oh, yes. 2. Dealer takes 3. The Inspector thinks the world of Charlie. You can see that. Well, why not? He's a brilliant man. - Brilliant. - Oh, my, yes. Your bet, Bill. Well, as I was saying, we always have been very friendly with the Popes, but I must confess I was truly surprised when we got the mailed invitation to their home for their anniversary dinner. Oh! I'm sure it will be wonderful. Commissioner Warren's going to be there. I heard the mayor will be there. Do you know that the Captain insisted that I have a new dress made for the affair? I'll raise. Who's making the dress for you, Sara? Oh, I have a little woman. Hmm, they're always the best. You have to watch them every minute of the way, though. Tell them exactly what you want and how to do it. Design the whole thing yourself. How many did you draw? - One. - Not enough! Like this. Scoop neck, beaded top, iridescent beads, very petite, like little tiny flowers on chiffon. - Chiffon. - Lavender chiffon. I pass. - Over taffeta. - Absolutely stunning. - Just stunning. - Oh, my, yes. How many did you draw? - Cream cheese and olive. - Iridescent beads. Beaded top. Excuse me. I'm sick. Ka... Kathy. I didn't hear you get up. Feeling better? Yes. Can I get you something? No. Glass of milk? No, thanks. Might help you sleep. What's the matter, angel? Please. Don't call me "angel." I loathe it. Is there anything... Are you sure you're all right? Stop talking down to me as though I were an idiot child! Of course I'm all right! Easy now. Maybe it isn't as bad as all that. It's worse. It's worse than that. I can't stand another night of it, not another minute. Sara Alidos and the Captain. Iridescent beads and lavender chiffon. The Inspector and Mrs. Pope. "That's Tony and Alice, you know." "Oh, Sara, you will look stunning!" "Oh, Sara, the men adore the Captain!" "Oh, Sara, the Captain is such a brilliant man!" Well, I despise them. I despise all that crawlers around them. I won't be one, and I won't let my husband be one! Is this what you have to look forward to? This... this mediocrity? This waiting to be wrapped away in mothballs of a pension? 2 percent up and 2 percent down? Don't you have any ambition? - Don't you want to... - Darling, darling, don't, don't. All I want, nothing else, is to make you happy. Oh, Bill, Bill, I am happy. Maybe if... if I didn't love you so much, I'd be happier. But I want you to be somebody! Not for my sake, but for yours! For yours! Kathy, Kathy, you listen to me. Try to understand. - I love you, Kathy. - Oh. All these jobs, positions, ratings, it's all nothing. I do this because it gives us a living. Because it makes it possible for us to live in peace and security. Because it makes it possible for us to be together. That's what's important. That's all that matters. Oh, Bill. Oh! Oh, Bill! - Are you all right? - Yes. Are you sure? Uh-huh. Can... can you come out? Oh, yes. Of course. You're sure you're all right? Oh, yes. Please, don't worry. Oh! How awful. You'll have to be towed in. Oh, that's all right. I'm just grateful I didn't hit you. My house is right here on the corner if you'd like to use the telephone. That would be very kind of you. I'm supposed to meet my husband for lunch. Oh, of course. But I'd be happy to drive you to him. Oh, no. That would be too much of an imposition. I'm to meet him downtown, Los Angeles police headquarters. Police headquarters? Yes, he's a detective in the Central Division. Lieutenant William Doyle. Well, now, this is indeed a strange coincidence. I am Mrs. Anthony Pope. My husband is inspector of that division. It is a small world, after all. Yes. Well, this is one accident we won't have to worry about reporting to the police. They'll hear about it soon enough. Well, come on. Come with me. Thank you. Oh, you must be really shaken up. I'm sorry. No, it was my own fault. I haven't anybody to blame but myself. I'm sorry. And then she said, "I don't think we'll have to report this accident to the police. They'll learn about it soon enough." Is that what I said? I thought it was very amusing. Very funny. I must have been in shock. Times like that, we're never really aware of what we're saying or doing. Here's your drink, Mrs. Doyle. Well, I always drive very carefully. Actually, the first thing I can clearly remember is sitting here with Mrs. Pope... - Alice. - With Alice... I think driving is a great responsibility, don't you? ...and getting Bill on the phone. You know, that I've been driving for 20 years now. And I've never had an accident. All right, Sara, leave it alone. Not one. Maybe a few near misses, but nothing that was ever really my fault. Never. You mustn't be discouraged, Sara. You must keep on trying. And I got Bill on the phone, and I said "Bill, I can't meet you for lunch because..." No, dear. You said, uh, "Bill, you'd better go right out and get your lunch "because I've just driven up Mrs. Pole's telephone pope." Thank you. Well, dinner everybody. Darling, finish your drink, and bring Kathy in. Come on. Come on. Well, watch out. You really had a very narrow escape, you know. Might have been seriously injured. It's my own fault. I cut the corner instead of making a proper turn. Well, that happens. Especially if you're trying to cut corners. You were supposed to meet your husband for lunch? Mm-hmm. I understand you live in the valley, Mrs. Doyle? And so, what was I doing on the other side of town in Westwood? Isn't that the next question? No, it's not. I think I'll save that question for another time. A time, perhaps, when I might really need it. By that time, Inspector, I should have a very satisfactory answer. I'm sure you will. Shall we? And frankly, Kathy, for some time now, I, I haven't been feeling too well, and so... What's wrong? Oh, nothing serious. Just... Fatigue, I guess. Anyway, Tony and I decided that for his birthday we'd spend a quiet weekend in Palm Springs, just the two of us. Well, you ought to stay at least a week. The rest would be good for both of you. If only I could persuade Tony. Well, you know, if you go just for the weekend, Tony will want to be back at the office on Monday, but... I have an idea. Why don't you give Tony a birthday party on Saturday night? A party? And then insist he drive to Palm Springs on Sunday. I see. Then he might stay. Do you really think... Ouch! Do you really think he might? Well, you know that all men are like little boys at a birthday party, especially a surprise. He'll enjoy having his friends around him on that night and he won't be able to refuse you anything you ask. Oh, I wonder if he would agree to that. You leave everything to me. Just pretend you're going to Palm Springs. And then that way, it will really be a surprise. Yes. I could make up a guest list. You just leave everything to me. - Mrs. Warren? - Hello? This is Kathy Doyle. Mrs. Doyle. - How are you? - Good. And you? Oh, fine, thank you. Oh, Alice Pope and I are giving the Inspector a surprise birthday party, Saturday night. Their place? Yes. At home. And Alice was wondering if you and the Commissioner... Saturday night? Yes. We'd love to come. Oh, that would be wonderful. Tell Alice... Yes. Yes, I'll tell her. Thank you so much. Goodbye. Hello? Hello, Kathy? This is Sara Alidos. Oh, hello, Sara. I've been calling your number for over an hour, now, but your line's been so busy and... Well, I... I had a few calls to make. Well, the Captain suggested that we might drive to Palm Springs together on Friday. You know, use only one car. Oh? You're going to Palm Springs? Why, of course. Saturday is the... Oh, I thought you, you might have heard that the Captain decided we'd spend the weekend on the desert. No. Well, he's been feeling a little tired lately and... Kathy, you haven't heard anything about going to Palm Springs? No. But, uh, we couldn't go. As a matter of fact, I was trying to get you on the phone to see if you were free over the weekend. Are you sure you won't change your plans? No. No, I don't want to disappoint the Captain. Well, goodbye, Kathy. Goodbye, Sara. And have a nice weekend. I just don't understand what could've happened to Sara and Charlie. When I talked to Sara, she said she couldn't change her plans for the weekend. Oh, she might at least have called me. I-I think I ought to speak to her when she... Oh, I wouldn't do that, Alice. It might embarrass her. Well, I suppose it would. Alice, a wonderful party. Everything's just perfect. Well, I'm afraid I can't take any of the bows. - They all belong to Kathy. - Oh! Well... well, if I should ever be rash enough to admit to another birthday, Mrs. Doyle, I'll have you arrange the party for me, even if I must get a warrant to do it. Bill! Bill! Darling, the Commissioner threatens me with a warrant to arrange a party for him. And I wouldn't put it past you to make my own husband serve it. Well, I'm a police officer, ma'am. If the Commissioner orders me to make an arrest, I guess I'll have to do it. Excuse me. I think I need a lawyer. You're in Central Division, Doyle? That's right. I have been for a while. Thank you. Thank you. - For what? - For the party. Oh, that was Alice's idea. A better idea than Palm Springs. A better idea for your friends. They can be with you. But not all of them. Tell me. Where'd you meet Doyle? San Francisco. The Dana case. Oh, yes. I remember that. You were the newspaperwoman... Mm-hmm. Yes. - A smart piece of work. - Thank you. You, uh... doing anything now? Only what every other wife does. No. Not you. Not a woman like you. There must be something more. I used to think so, too, until I met Bill. I'm stubborn. I can't buy that. Why not? Why isn't it enough for me now just to be a... Yes. I know you love your husband. But whatever it was that drove you along in your newspaper work, whipped you into doing the things you did. You were you then. You're the same you now. That you isn't going to make a very easy settlement with life. Oh, I don't know. What else has life got to offer in the final settlement? Maybe the answer might be found in a file I keep in my office. Strange offenses committed by seemingly normal people, all of them searching for an answer. I'd like to see that file. I'd be very happy to show it to you. Thank you, Inspector. Most of them seem to be women. Maybe because women reason with life only just so far. Frustration can lead them quickly to violence. I agree. Right now, frustration is threatening to lead me to violence. Ever since I've come in this room, I've been dying to ask you about that picture. May I see it? Taken 18 years ago. You've changed... a lot. And not only on the outside. What were you like then? I don't even know what I'm like now. Oh, no. No. Not you. You knew what you were then. You know what you are now. You know yourself. And you know everything there is to know about people. Yes, there are people like us. You once told me I'm the same woman now that I was in San Francisco. Yes? Well, I've a confession to make. I've begun to look for an escape. Hours of free time. Going through these files with you. From time to time, I find interesting cases. I'd like to talk to you about them, from time to time. And I don't know what's got into Charlie lately. Chews me out every chance he gets. Like tonight, a simple pinch, but back at the office, why he rips me up and down in front of the boys, too. "Where'd I leave my brains?" And "don't I know enough not to get in the way of the evidence?" And "maybe I'm getting too big for my britches." So... so, I just stood there and took it. - Bill. - Yeah? I want you to quit. Quit what? I want you to quit the department. I don't understand, Kathy. I want your work to be less demanding, quieter duties. And we can have that if you go into the Beverly Hills police. There's no problem for you to join the Beverly Hills department. Oh, no, but... but why? Because it's quieter there. No crimes, homicide, violence. Oh, yeah, but Kathy, do you realize what quitting the department would mean? I've put in 10 years in Los Angeles. I've got something that only years can buy. Seniority. And if I go to Beverly, why, it would mean starting all over again. But I can't take this anymore. I go crazy every time you're called out on an emergency. Oh, you know I can take care of myself. Until the one time your luck runs out. Oh, darling. Darling, I want you with me more. And we can have that if you go into Beverly. Well, darling, I didn't realize how you... Sure, sure. It's not that important, if it means this much to you. Oh, Bill. Never mind. Maybe it's just nerves. No. No, I'll put in for my resignation in the morning. Like you say, no problem for me to make the Beverly Hills police. I don't want to do anything to make you unhappy. I love you so much. The only way you can make me unhappy is to stop loving me like that. You know, Kathy, there's something going on that I don't understand. I never thought Inspector Pope took such an interest in me. What happened? Oh, about the resignation, he wants us to think it over. Why me? He said he'd been thinking of making some changes in Central Division. What kind of changes? He didn't say. But something about my working closer with him. I told him that my mind was already made up, but that I'd talk it over with you. He said to tell you that he personally asked that we reconsider. Oh, darling, I've been selfish, horribly selfish. Tony Pope likes you, is interested in you, and you'll be happy working with him and that's all that matters. Are you sure it's alright? Oh, yes, darling. Very sure. Hi. Home is the traveler. Hello, darling. What's wrong? Nothing. You don't look quite right. Oh, just a little headache, that's all. Something worrying you? No. No. Hungry? Oh, maybe some ham and eggs, huh? You get comfortable. I'll fix them. Everything go all right in Phoenix? Yeah, routine. Drove all the way in without stopping. I, uh, wanted to get home. You know, since I've been working for Pope, I've been more of a traveling salesman than a police officer. Work everywhere but L.A. Do you realize that in the last month, I've been on out-of-town assignments 3... What's this, Kathy? Kathy, what is this? "Don't think you are fooling anyone, Kathy Doyle. "Don't think it isn't clear to anyone with half an eye, except your blind husband." What is this? Who wrote it? I-I don't know. There've been 3 of them. I didn't want you upset. Listen, I want it all. Some woman wrote this, right? I want to know who it was. I knew this would happen. That's why I wanted us to get away from here. I knew there would be gossip... Gossip! Gossip? About what? About Tony Pope and me. Tony Pope? Will you tell me who wrote it? Will you please tell me who wrote it? It must have been Sara. Sara and Charlie Alidos, they hate me, they hate both of us because of Tony and Alice Pope. Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill, please don't do anything. Bill! No admission, eh? We figure maybe we can get one. How? According to your own report, he's out-thought and out-talked you five ways from the middle. Well, he... he likes to talk. Words roll out like marbles. We figure if we let him run off at the mouth... Get him! Come on! Are you crazy? Give me a hand! The next... next time you mention my wife's name, I come after you with my gun. "Lieutenant William Doyle, "charged with pre-meditated attack "upon superior officer, Captain Charles Alidos. Witnesses: Sergeants James and Jules." - Sergeant James. - Yes, sir. Stand by your chair, please. You were present last night when this alleged attack took place. Now, what happened? Well, uh, Sergeant Jules and I were going over a squeal with Captain Alidos, when Lieutenant Doyle came busting into the office. What do you mean, "came busting into the office"? Well, sir, I mean... Did Lieutenant Doyle kick in any doors? Oh, no, sir. Did Lieutenant Doyle tear down any walls? No, sir. Did Lieutenant Doyle force his way into the office in any manner? No, sir. Then I can't understand what you mean by "busting" into the office. An unfortunate choice of words, sir. I... I mean to say Lieutenant Doyle came into the office. Yes, I see. There is a difference. When you say a man comes "busting" into a room, there is the implication of violence. Don't you agree? Yes, sir. All right, James. Continue. Well, Lieutenant Doyle came in the office. Captain Alidos was seated on the corner of the desk. He looked up when he saw the Lieutenant, and... Go on. Well, sir, I think I noticed the Captain make a sort of a move with his hand. What kind of move? As though he might be... like he was reaching for his gun, sir. Sergeant Jules? Yes, sir. Did you see the Captain move for his gun? Well, sir, I... I don't remember. But after Lieutenant Doyle struck the Captain, the gun did come out of the holster. You saw him get his gun out of his holster? Well, no, sir. But I knocked it out of his hand. I see. All right, James, you saw the Captain reach for his gun. This was after Lieutenant Doyle made the alleged attack? Oh, no, sir. Just as Lieutenant Doyle came busting... uh, came into the room, sir. You're saying, then, the Captain reached for his gun before the alleged attack. Well, yes, sir, but... But what? Nothing, Inspector. Captain Alidos. Did you reach for your gun before Lieutenant Doyle launched the alleged attack? You keep saying, sir, "the alleged attack." There is nothing alleged about the way my face looks. You haven't answered my question. I, uh, I don't remember. Sergeant James testified that you reached for your gun. I heard him. I might have. I-I don't remember, I... I saw Doyle come busting in. Yes, sir, busting in, with clear intent to attack me. I... I might have reached. I'm... I'm not sure. You say he came in with clear intent to attack you. Now, why... why would you expect the Lieutenant to attack you? May I speak to you alone a minute, sir? Please, wait outside. All right, Bill. What happened? I don't know whether or not Alidos did go for his gun. I did come "busting in" with the intent of beating him up. I guess he knew it when he saw my face. He and his wife, they, uh... well, they've been spreading some vicious gossip about Mrs. Doyle and... some man. Did he mention the man's name? It doesn't matter. None of it's true. Just Captain Alidos, please. This is messy business. An attack against a fellow officer cannot be justified. On the other hand, neither can we find justification for indiscriminate gunplay in the squad rooms. This entire issue is muddied and, uh... a disgrace to both of you. It's my feeling that a full hearing of this case could serve no purpose, except to damage, unjustly, the prestige of the department. I suggest we consider the incident closed. Sorry to... Get you out of bed, Kathy? Oh, that's all right. Heard from Bill? He called earlier. Expects to be home tomorrow evening. What's wrong, Tony? It's Alice. She... hasn't been well lately. You know that. Nothing we can put our fingers on. It's... it's just... she's been in Mercy Hospital for two days now. Observation. What do the doctors say? That it's all up to me. I don't understand, Tony. Alice isn't... well, she... just can't take the tension much longer. You're married to a detective. You know what I mean. Pressure and worry over the years. She just can't stand it off any longer. The doctors tell me she needs a complete release from tension. That's the way they put it. All day, I've been trying to find the right thing to do. We can still have a lot of good years together. Guess I owe Alice that much. Yeah. Only one thing I can do. Retire. Isn't easy. Can't see much life without the department. It's been my life, all of it. All those years. Funny. Where'd they go? One morning you wake up, look in the mirror, and you... Well, we're always living in tomorrow. Tomorrow, the department will still be there. I'll be gone. There'll be another man, another inspector. Inspector Doyle. Inspector William Doyle. Doyle. Yeah, Bill might be a choice. Might in time. Might. Yeah. A word for Bill, and he... Oh, Kathy, I feel just wonderful. No thanks to the doctors, though. Probe, pinch, push. Best medicine was Tony, when he told me he'd retire. You know what this can mean for Bill. Of course, you do. Is Tony coming up there this afternoon? He's very busy with last-minute arrangements. We're leaving for Honolulu next week, you know. Next week? I know I'll love Hawaii. But I'll miss you. We'll both miss you, Kathy. I'll miss you, too. But I'm so happy for you. Take care of yourself. I'll call you tomorrow. Los Angeles police department. Inspector Pope, please. Who's calling Inspector Pope? Mrs. Pope. Hello, Alice. Tony, I used her name because I've called you three times and you... I told you... I must talk to you. There are people in my office. I don't care what anybody thinks. Not now. All right. Meet me at Barkley's at 3:00. All right. All right, I'll meet you there in 15 minutes. It's important that we... Hello? H-Hello? Tony, you can't do this to me, not after you... Not so loud. Now, listen to me. Ever since that night, I've been sick. I don't like what I did, because of Bill. All right, it happened. I'll figure it as my fault. But that's the end of it. That night, anything happened, anything said, the end of it. You follow me? You're not putting Bill in for the job. I'm not putting Bill in for the job. But you promised, Tony. You promised... Pillow talk. I've got a responsibility to the department. I won't sell that out for something we both stole. Bill's not good enough for the job. He just isn't. That's all there is to it. Who is your man? Charlie Alidos. I've been preparing him for the job for years. Good man, Charlie. Made a mistake when I transferred him out. Now, if I have to apologize to him, that's all right, too. Apologize. Alidos. Man for the job. Apologize. Alidos. Man for the job. Man for the job. Man for the job. You all right, madame? May I get you... you are feeling all right? You don't look so... A drink? Maybe you should have a drink. You know... all of a sudden, you were so... I don't know. You're, you're very kind. Yes, a drink. Bacon almost ready? - You said ham. - Ham? Ham and eggs. Now you say bacon. I thought I said... Why don't you say what you want? I'm not a mind reader. Aw, what's the difference, honey? Bacon is bacon. Ham is ham. That's the difference. I told you, it doesn't matter. Don't tell me what matters. Just tell me what you want. Kathy, look, this is silly. So all right, I'll eat the ham. Oh, don't be such a martyr. Eat whatever you like. Give it to him. Give it to him. In the middle. In the middle. Give it to him. Let him have it. Hit him. A radio call. We got to roll to headquarters. Drugstore on Alameda. How many of them? Two. One's in the hospital. I had to throw a couple of slugs into his legs. The other one's in interrogation with Lieutenant Nelda. Any make on them? Tom's down at R & I now. Druggist dead? Yeah. Caught four in the chest. Both guns? Yeah. Both blasted. Shootin' gallery. They high? Yeah. Loaded. We figure it's the same pair that's been hitting the drugstores in Central this last month. Any statement? Not yet. But they'll come through. We got 'em cold. Well, I think it'll just be a few minutes, Kathy, but if it looks rough, why, Tom'll take you home, ok? Inspector Pope been notified? Yeah. We'll be in interrogation. Right. Sure is terrible, Mrs. Doyle. Young fellows, too. Never think. Hardly shaved yet. If I had my way, anybody caught selling them guns, the gas chamber. Where are they? Interrogation, sir. Yes, ma'am. Murder, that's what it is. Taking kids hardly out of high school yet, putting guns in their hands. The sellers, they're the ones. They're the real killers. If I had my way, pass the law, the gas chamber. And make it stick, I would. May I have some water, please? Certainly. Here you are, ma'am. Thank you. Well, looks like a rough night, Kathy. Better have Tom take you home. I'll go alone. Tom can bring you home when you're finished. Are you sure you don't mind? Good night. What are you doing here? I've got to talk to you. It's no use. You've got to listen to me! It's important! Tony. Tony, it isn't just the job for Bill anymore. Now it's all mixed up with me, inside, living with myself. Tony, you've got to leave me some justification for what I did. I need it. I need it to be able to go on living with Bill, to be able to look at myself, to be able to... Tony... Tony, I beg you. Listen, ever since the day you had your little accident, we haven't fooled each other. You dealt the cards, I played them as they came. All right. All right, Tony. If you can't say the word for Bill, then just don't put in for anybody. Just, just leave it alone. There's a good chance Bill might get the job anyway, but not if you say, "I want Alidos." I do want Alidos. No, Tony, no. Not after what I've done. - Not after what I've... - The game's over. In my book, you wind up with enough chips. Now pick 'em up and go home. Good night, Bill. Good night, Tom. Good night. Fill me in. Caught one in the head. Doyle been notified? Not yet. Have someone call him. Yeah. Yeah, right away. What is it, Bill? Sorry, Kathy. Tried not to wake you. I have to roll. It's just another squeal. You go back to sleep. Must you go, darling? You've just come off a job, and you're ti... It's nothing they can't handle without me, but you know how they are. They can't sleep, so neither can I. Be back in time for breakfast. There's the bus. I'd turn in my badge for less. All divisions, all squads. Days off and leaves cancelled. We roll 24 hours a day. Drop everything to concentrate on the killing of Pope. He may have been shoved across by some thug he once sent over. Check the prison releases on every case he ever handled. Round up every gunsel who ever had a reader sent out on him. I don't care what you have to do. Get him. Any questions? We know what you want. Except for one thing. I put the arm on him before the arrest is made. ...in session today. On the local front, Los Angeles police inspector Anthony Pope was found murdered in his home early this morning. The body was discovered by the maid, Angie Kroll. Inspector Pope had been shot once through the head. The only official statement issued... The photo of the bullet is ready. The M.E. said the bullet went in through the upper left orbital region, spun around the inside of the skull and lodged at the base. I figured it for a snub-nosed .38. A longer gun barrel, more firepower, it would have plowed out. That's the slug, huh? Yep. that's it. Give me the photo. Yeah. No, hold it. I'll take that with me. Hello? Did I wake you, darling? No. You heard? Yes. On the radio. Listen. Hold on to yourself. Alice will need you. Alice? Go to her. Stay with her, Kathy. It's rough. Yes. stay with Alice. When will you be home, darling? Not until we get him. I'll keep in touch with you. Try to help Alice. Goodbye. Bye. That drugstore killing, you got the photos? Yeah, sure. Got them right here. And the Pope photo? Uh-huh. Look at that. But... Yeah, but. Out of one of the guns that killed the druggist. It's impossible. You work on those guns? Never had them. Just the slugs the M.E. dug out of the druggist. The guns are tagged with the property clerk. There's the arresting officer's signature: Jules. There's the gun. One gun. I'll take it to the photo lab right away. Here's the print. No. The other gun. Pope was killed by the other gun. This is Doyle. Get a hold of Sgt. Jules, tell him to come to my office. Right away. Then I tagged this gun and I took it down to property. Two, two guns. There were two guns! There was just one gun,and I took it down to property. Two. I picked them both up. You remember? You said, "Shooting gallery. Both blasted." Do you remember that? Do you remember? Remember? Where is the other gun? Where's that other gun? Just a minute, Doyle. James, you and Sgt. Jules made that arrest? Yes, sir. - You took the two guns from the suspect? - Yes, sir. What did you do with them? Left them on the table by the headquarter's desk with the other belongings. Then Sgt. Jules and I waited for acting Captain Doyle. - Who was on duty at the desk? - Officer Spitz. Sgt. Jules, were there two guns on that table? Well, there must have been, sir. Either there was or there wasn't. Yes, sir. Two guns. And you both waited there with Officer Spitz until Doyle arrived? Yes, sir. Then the three of us went to interrogation after the Captain got there with Mrs. Doyle. Did you take one of the guns? No, sir. Did you ever leave your desk? No, sir, except to get some water for Mrs. Doyle. What did you do with the gun, Kathy? I love you, Bill. I'd do anything in the world for you. You killed Tony Pope, Kathy. Yes. You took the gun from the squad room? Yes. And you killed him? Yes, yes, yes, and you know why! I don't want to know why. He said, "No." He said, "Not the man for the job." He said, "Not good enough." But you are, you are good enough, good enough to bring in his own killer. Why couldn't you just leave it alone? And now I'll know. Now I'll know just how much of a cop you really are. The same cop, Kathy. The same cop you met in Frisco. Same cop I was 10 years ago, pounding a beat. The same cop. Oh, don't. Oh, Bill! Oh, Bill. Doyle, questioning in the Pope killing.
