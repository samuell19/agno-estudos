Okay, let's see what we've got. I must say Clare, this looks pretty good. Now let's see how it tastes. What was THAT! It was my interpretation of your signature dish. Your interpretation!? I didn't ask for your interpretation! My food that does not need to be interpreted! I need you to make it the way that I have told you it needs to be made. I just wanted to make it a little fancy... It doesn't need to be fancy, it needs to be edible! So you... didn't like the garlic? Garlic! Is that what that was? First of all, it didn't taste like garlic. It tasted like somebody's old sweaty gym sock! Secondly, of all the ingredients in this dish, do you know which one it doesn't need? Garlic? Yes Clare, garlic. Especially garlic that's been swept up off the floor and pulled from a dumpster before using it! I am going to be tasting this all night, and then even in my darkest nightmares! I was just trying to age the garlic to give it more kick. Well, Bravo! I feel like I've been donkey kicked in the tongue! It may have gone bad. Yes. I noticed that. Clare, never have I had anyone come into this kitchen with as much drive as you have. You come in early, you stay late, you pay attention to detail. I know how badly you want to be a chef, but first you have to learn the things I have to teach you, before you go out on your own trying new things. Now. Taste mine. Now you see the difference? Not really... OUT! So... I made this dish just like hers, except for maybe a couple of teeny tiny little changes, just to fancy it up, and she fires me. Well, it looks fantastic. That's terrible! I know, it's just that's what it's supposed to taste like. I really don't think that it is. Well, it's bold and avant-garde! It kind of made me throw up in my mouth a little. I made it just like hers. I followed her recipe to the letter. I know that I made it right. Yes, I made a couple of little changes. I've tasted both and frankly I think my version is better. It's the way that fancy food is supposed to taste. It definitely shouldn't taste like that if you want anyone to eat it. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Why is this so important to you? You work harder than anyone I know. You could do anything you put your mind to, Why do you want to be a chef so badly? I've always wanted to open up my own restaurant. I've always wanted to have a place where people could go and get a really great meal. A place that they could share their experiences and their celebrations or even if they had a really hard day, when you provide a great meal, you can make it just a little bit better. There's just no other feeling like that. That is a wonderful dream Clare. I just don't know if cooking is for you. I mean this really just tastes... well... Nasty! Fancy? Oh. I thought you're gonna say fancy there. No. Mmm maybe you should take another bite? No, that would not be good for... anyone. Maybe you should think about talking to Pastor John. Pastor John!? What would I have to talk with Pastor John about? I'm not going through some spiritual crisis, I just don't know what I want to do with my life and have no direction whatsoever. Maybe we need to talk about your definition of a crisis then. I think it would be good for you to talk to him. He's a great listener. He could pray with you, and he might just have some insights that could be useful. Would I have to lay on a couch? He's a pastor not a psychologist and I don't even think his office has a couch. He really helped Dan and me when we were going through some tough financial times. Spending time to prayer and talking about our concerns really helped us find some practical solutions and it helped our marriage. You don't have to wait for everything to fall apart before looking for little help from God you know. Yeah, I suppose you're right. I guess it couldn't hurt. And on the bright side this is a pretty good cup of coffee, so you got it in there somewhere. Thank you. So Clare, so happy to see you. It's good to see you outside of Sunday morning. Greetings and peace be unto you Pastor. ...and unto you too. Many thanks gracious Pastor. So, when you called and said you would like to see me I was wondering if possibly we met before but I can see now that we haven't. What? How? What? Am I doing something wrong? I knew I should have worn a dress! No Clare, you're fine. It's just that sometimes when people meet with me the first time they feel a little uncomfortable, a little nervous, and... I'm beginning to get a hint of that from you. No. What? No, no. I'm not uncomfortable. Just a little too much coffee this morning? Um... yeah, you know I may have had one espresso or two, maybe was more like three, but no more than four it's just that your secretary kept asking, and she said they were free and I needed something to do with my hands... Not a problem Clare, not a problem. There's no reason to be nervous. I'm just happy that you came in to see me today. So, why don't you tell me, what do you need to talk to me about? Um... well... to tell you the truth, I feel a little silly being here, it's not like I'm going through a major life crisis. Well that's fine, God can help us in the small things... It's just that my life has no meaning and I don't know what my purpose is. ...as well as the big things. So tell me, did something happen that could cause this unsettlement? Well, I just lost my job. Oh Clare, I'm so sorry to hear that. That can be very unsettling. The thing is, I don't know what I should do now, and I was hoping that maybe you could give me a sign? What kind of sign are you looking for? Um... I was well, thinking, maybe like a host of angels or a pillar of fire, or maybe a burning bush? I don't think so during our session today, but I found that oftentimes our trusted friends and family can see things in us that we don't see in ourselves, so have you been getting any comments or compliments and things that you do well? I'm not sure. I really want to encourage you to be on the lookout for those kind of things sometimes they're a little harder to spot than a burning bush, but oftentimes God will speak to us through those things. In the meantime why don't we take some time and ask God to open our eyes and to help encourage you. You mean like.. Talk to God right now? Yes. God can hear you when you whisper too, you know. Right! Of course, He can. Um, I meant, let's talk to God right now. Sounds good. This is pretty good. That IS pretty good! OK! Excuse me! Mrs.Winthrop, may I talk to you for a second? Oh, hello Clare. Beautiful day today isn't it? Huh? Oh, yes. Yes I guess it is. What can I do for you dear? Well, I've been trying some new recipes and I need a second opinion, so I was wondering would you try this and tell me what you think? You say YOU made this dear? Yes, just now. Would you give it a taste? Well, I suppose a small sip wouldn't hurt... much. Oh thank you Mrs. Winthrop I really appreciate it! It's actually quite good. You say YOU made this dear? Yes, why? No reason. Well you are to be congratulated, that is a very fine cup of coffee. Well, thank you very much! I appreciate it! No trouble dear, have a wonderful day! Thank you! You too! Pretty Good! I can see you have quite a bit of experience in the culinary field several different jobs doing prep work at some pretty impressive restaurants in town. How come you are interested in working at a coffee shop? I have always wanted to work in the food service industry. My whole life. I love serving people, and the joy that giving good food and great service can bring to people, I guess I'm just still looking for the right fit and place to do that. Well, I have to say in some ways you are overqualified for the position, and there's not a lot of room here for creativity either. Every drink has to taste exactly the same, day and night, regardless of who's behind the counter, That's not a problem. I'm used to following instructions very carefully when doing prep work on the line, and I have a great eye for detail. Well, it can be extremely busy here... Well at least used to be. Stupid "Coffee Korner" Anyway, it could still get extremely busy in here especially in the mornings, so I need someone who could just jump behind the counter and start pumping out drinks. They have to be good and they have to be fast. People are in a hurry to get to where they need to go, so you may have trouble finding your sea legs. Sir, it's like you said, I have a great deal of experience working in many kitchens all over town. It always had to be done fast, and it always had to be done right. Pressure is something I've learned how to handle. Okay. Can I get a triple half-caf, one and a quarter pump hazelnut, breve latte, no foam, upside down, with a dusting of cinnamon? What? Can I get a triple, half caf, one and a quarter pump hazelnut, breve latte, no foam, upside-down, dusting a cinnamon? Thanks. I'm not sure you're saying words right now? Mm-hmm can. Can I GET a triple, half CAF one and a quarter pump, hazelnut breve latte, no foam, upside-down dusting a cinnamon Yes, of course. Thank you. Oh! May I see your driver's license please? It's me... it's me... Thank you all right so that's going to be a half-caf triple with this shot in the head haze and light and what's the name on that? Mike. Right. I'm coming up, right away, Mike. Alright! I have 1/2 caps for bold upside-down Revie the sprinkles on top for Mike! There you go, and have a great day! What is that? That's not what I ordered! Well, that's... No, that is disgusting! It's what you... No, it's awful! It's a... Awful. Is that even coffee? Well, that's the... No. Is there someone else that maybe can make it right, that works here? Besides you? Sometime this morning would be great! Yeah, not you. His name is Sam. Sam! Sam would be great. Today. So he really spit out the drink? Like it was poison. Right there in the coffee shop? Without hesitation. Well, that could have gone better. Yes it could have, and it did not. Well I'm sure there's plenty of other food that are left um... what do you think about hot dog on a stick? Like I could pull that uniform off? Sweetie, nobody can pull off that uniform. That's probably why they're always hiring. This is just a temporary setback. I'll get past this. You said he spit out your drink, "like it was poison." Your exact words. Yeah, I bet I mean who's ever heard of a triple salchow, half caf, and a pump at a quarter of whatever, who cares, it doesn't matter, the point is he didn't even get my drink of chance! Again, because he spit it out. No, I can do this. But you're right. About the poison? No. Well I mean maybe, no, about me. About how I do too much too soon. I don't need to jump in at a deep end of the pool on the first day, I need to wade in the kiddie pool first. Oh gross! Kids pee in there you know. It's just a metaphor. Still... I need to slow down, take my time and develop my own signature drinks. Something really great that you can't get anywhere else. I don't need to be spending my hours learning someone else's recipes, no, I need to use that time to make my own. Okay, but then what? Are you going to open your own shop? You don't have the money for that. And even if you could get a bank loan for a shop then you need more money to spread the word. How will people know to come to your shop instead of one of a hundred others, they're all over town. Do you know the other day I saw a Starbucks in the back of another Starbucks!? Yeah but if it's like you said, and everybody's opening up their coffee shops, well then why can't I open one? You're always telling me that I can do ever I want, as long as I put my mind to it. Well, I think I want to put my mind into this! Come on, I mean how hard can it be? Blueberry? Hey there. Can I help you with anything today? Yes. Um I'm actually thinking about opening up my own coffee shop, you know, nothing too fancy, I mean, well, maybe a little fancy. I was just wondering how much an espresso machine would cost? Yes, of course! I could definitely help you with that. Now, you say you don't want anything too fancy? Just a little fancy. No problem. Well, this machine here is the Super Steam 9000. Beautiful double boiler system to ensure a constant 220 degrees from your first extraction to your last. Has a separate boiler of course, for your built-in steam wand. Beautiful stainless steel finish easy to clean, makes for a great showpiece behind the counter. This machine is a great starter for any coffee shop capable of making a fantastic espresso. Sounds great! So, how much would a machine like that cost? Well, the Super Steam here goes for a very reasonable $9,900. Now it was voted best machine for the price, three years running. It's in the lower price range of the machines we carry, but if you want to open a coffee shop and don't have 30 grand to spend on a new espresso machine, this is the machine you want to buy. Okay... um... what if we were to go with not even a little fancy? Well what kind of price point were you looking at? So remember, I'm just sticking with the basics... I was thinking maybe the $250 ballpark, hopefully sticking closer to the infield if you know what I'm saying? No I don't. Is that a baseball reference? I don't know, maybe. I mean somebody said that to me once and I thought it sounded nice. I don't even watch baseball. Me either. Gotcha. So, I guess I am saying that I am looking for something in the 250 dollar range, but I'm really hoping to find something just as good for less than that. Hmm... I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with that. I don't think we carry anything in your price range. All right maybe you could tell me how much I should expect to spend on one of your more basic machines. Our least expensive machine that we carry, starts out at $7,500. Now it can be a little temperamental, but with some trial and error and the little finesse it should be able to help get you started and handle the volume you would need to run a commercial operation. I see. So do you have any of those machines on sale... well... for I don't know 97 percent off in the near future? I don't think so. Scratch and dent model? Yes! We might have one or two in stock! 97 percent off? No. Well sir, I thank you for your time and I bid you a good day. Well hey, don't get dressed up on my account. What? Oh yeah, sorry. Didn't get much sleep last night. What's wrong? Are you okay? No, yeah no no... I'm fine it's just my mattress, it's lumpy. It's a long story. Okay. Well how are things going on the coffee shop front? The dream is dead. I don't know why I sound so surprised it's just my life. The place where dreams come to die. Wow, that doesn't sound like you. No? Well maybe it should! Maybe this is how I should sound all the time! Why have dreams? They only cause you to want things, only to be slapped awake by the cold hard hand of reality! So, I'm going to guess, opening a coffee shop is going to be a little harder than you first thought? If by "a little harder", you mean impossible, then yes, yes it is! Forget about find any kind of decent rental space, the equipment alone costs a small fortune. Even if you try to lease it! I don't have that kind of money, I can't even afford a hole in the wall much less someplace... Please don't say... Fancy! Yes. Look Clare. I know you want to do something great, and you want to provide something for people that is special. Just because you can't afford to open a retail store, doesn't mean your dream has to die. Why are you trying to put this on life-support? It can't breathe! It can't eat! I mean that's no way to live! Just pull the plug and let the dream die! I'm going to assume that's just the lack of sleep talking. It can't sleep! Just pull the plug Kate, pull the PLUG! You're going to be fine you just need... What's the point? There's no reason to live! A reason to live. Look. I want you to consider for a moment that your dreams aren't dead. You're just overly tired and being a little melodramatic. Really? Do you think so? I'm fairly certain. I don't have to pull the plug? Not if you don't want to. Clare, you've always got big plans grand ideas, and that's great, but you also have the tendency to try to fly before you can crawl I just wanted it to be fancy. I think you've mentioned that before, and that's not impossible, but you might not be able to get it all at the same time. You said you wanted to open your own shop right? Yes. And what do you need to do that? A million dollars? I was thinking more about recipes. You said you want to make drinks that only you could make. That people would have to come to you to get. You don't have to open a retail store to figure that out. Why don't you just buy some ingredients and start experimenting at home and once you get the basics down then you can get... Fancy? Yes. You can start to get fancy. Then you can see what the next step should be. Wha... I'm a mess. Yeah, I noticed that. You know we should get you out of here before those birds start to make a nest in your hair. Well... it's definitely not fancy, but I think that could really work. And it would be really great to get rid of all this. Hello... welcome home. I'm going to put you over here. How are you? My name is Clare. Welcome Home. So glad to have you, Now, let me get to know you... one minute please. Ahhh... Come on. Take a taste. I don't think I want to. Please, I need some honest feedback. I can't get better if I don't have someone taste my drinks. What about your neighbor? She said she'd rather die first or did she say that she almost died from the first drink that I gave... You know I can't remember. You're my best friend, if a girl can't count on her best friend then who can she count on? I am NOT your best friend. Why would you say that? Of course you're my best friend! Why on earth would you try to poison your best friend? Okay, so the last few drinks have not been perfect but they haven't been that bad... Not that bad? Not That BAD? The first drink you made me I didn't sleep for something like, I don't know, three days! Now grant you, I was able to almost paint the entire outside of my house, so you're right it wasn't that bad at least not compared to the last one. Which sent me straight to the bathroom! And boy was it a wild ride! I'm NOT talking some politely stroll to the bathroom because you have a funny feeling in your tummy, type situation. No! I'm talking full-on run for your life, because there ain't no amount of clinching gonna hold back that tidal wave, thing! It was get in there, and hang on for dear life! Well... at least you've lost some weight. Oh. You really think so? Mm-hmm That's so sweet. Pleeeease. You have never looked better, and your house looks pretty good too. You're paying the doctor bills. Well? Hmm... not bad... Actually, it's pretty good. So am I ready to go public? Well let's give it another minute and I'll let you know. Oh, Mrs. Winthrop! Over here! Hello! Oh hello, Clare. How are you today, dear? I'm very well. Thank you, how are you? Very good, very good. So far at least. Well, I'm so grateful to hear that. Would you like to try a drink? I've been testing out some new recipes and I'd really love to hear what you think. Well.. I really shouldn't have coffee this late in the day... It's 1:15 p.m. Even still... Please, just a sip... There's nothing fancy it's just, tried-and-true, basic espresso. I've worked really hard on these recipes, and I think I'm ready for some public opinion and I've already had a few customers today and not one single violent reaction so you're perfectly safe. I promise! Okay. Well maybe just a sip. Great! What would you like a straight espresso or a latte? Whatever is easiest, dear. Well how about a latte? I could use some practice steaming my milk... which is still pretty good, it's still perfectly safe. Very well. Thank you. ORDER UP! Would you care for a fabulous publication while you wait? Oh. No thank you dear, I'm fine. Alright. I'll have your drink for you in just a minute. Order for Mrs. Winthrop! Oooh. My poor heart. Not bad. Not bad at all. Would you say that it's just as good as one you might buy when you're in downtown? Well maybe not, but it's still pretty good dear. Definitely better than what I could make for myself, so I suppose that's worth something. Yeah. I guess so. Well thank you so much for supporting Clare's Coffee. Oh you're very welcome dear. Oh... Oh. Mrs.Winthrop I gonna need that back. I only have two. Yes of course. What have we here? Welcome to "Coffee Korner" a true refuge and curator for the discerning palate and drinkers of coffee. By Ellis Winston the First. Hmmm. This gives me an idea. "Ellis Winston the First"... sounds fancy! Uhh... Mr. Winston? Yeah. Mr. Ellis Winston the First? Yep. The author and creator of the award-winning website "Coffee Korner" Ellis Winston the First? You invited me here? Oh yes! Yes, of course I did! Please come inside, it's such a pleasure to meet you! Okay. So you wanted my opinion on your coffee? Yes, very much so! First of all, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of your blog and I'm opening up a coffee shop here in town, and I want to do things right from this start, So I just wanted to get your thoughts on my basic recipes. Alright. Well, I don't really need your whole life story, but I'm here. So, what do you got? Why don't you go ahead and take a seat and make yourself comfortable. Would you care for a periodical while you wait? Is this gonna take long? I have stuff to do today. Oh, yes of course! Let me just make your drink. I wanted it to be as fresh as possible so you could really tell me what you think. Here we go! Do you really want to know what I think? Yes, very much so. I think you should take that, and go pour it down the drain. Sorry? You should be. I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? Yes. You invited me over for a latte. This is not a latte. This is disgusting brown water with some milk in it. But, you didn't even taste it. I don't need to taste it. And risk destroying my highly developed palette by putting that in my mouth? No, this is unacceptable, even by home coffee standards. Look, thanks for wasting my time. Wait, please? I don't understand. What's wrong? For starters, your coffee had clearly been ground before I got here. Now, I'm not gonna be so rude as to suggest that it's pre-ground coffee, but it clearly looks like pre-ground coffee to me. It's certainly NOT freshly ground coffee from freshly roasted beans, which would be required to make it taste halfway decent. Furthermore it takes nine bars of pressure to make a proper espresso. That machine there, you'd be lucky to get three bars of pressure out of it, if you know what you're doing. Which clearly you don't. Thus the liquid coming out of it couldn't possibly be called espresso or even espresso like. So what you served me was a hot cup, of brown water with milk in it. And your lack of a thermometer, makes me question whether or not it was really hot. So again, Thank you for ruining my entire day. You're welcome? Well I don't know what he's talking about. I think this tastes good, Really good. Are you sure you didn't misunderstand? Yeah, pretty sure. You said he didn't even taste it? He did not. Then how could he possibly know? Oh, He had some pretty strong ideas. Well, I think he's crazy. What does his opinion matter anyway? He's just some fancy snob who writes on the internet. Actually he wasn't even all that fancy. So he's an unfancy snob that writes on the internet. I think his mom drove him here. I think you just made my point It's just that the "Coffee Korner" has hundreds of thousands of dedicated readers, and every coffee shop that he recommends has lines going out the door. And everyone that he slams, goes out of business. Well maybe you can get a cheap lease from one of them. Not without his approval I can't. Well, did he say anything you could actually use? He said I could pour my dreams down the drain! Did he say why you should do that? Because the universe is against me, and wants to crush my dreams! He actually said that? No, but he implied by his tone. Well what did he say with his actual words? He implied that I use pre-ground coffee. What do you use? Pre-ground coffee! Oh. Well that seems like something you can change. Anything else? He said that I don't know how to get the most out of my machine. Oh okay. Well, that's good. That means there's something more that you could learn, and you don't have to spend money buying things you can't afford. What else? That I could pour my dreams down the drain! Well... I'm not sure you should take the advice of someone who may or may not have been driven here by their mother on that. But, it does sound like there are a couple of things that you can do something about. It sounds to me like it might be time to get a little bit... Fancy. It's time to get fancy? Get your fancy on girlfriend! YES! Let's get fancy! Clare, that is amazing! You think so? I mean is it as good as the one that you bought on the way over here, in case that one turned out to be a disaster? Well. If I'm being honest... I stopped doing that weeks ago! These are great! I can't even go to Starbucks anymore! For real? For real! Wait, are you just being nice? Well I always try to be nice, but if you had your own shop, that is where I would go to buy coffee, and I would look forward to it every time. Oh thank you! That means a lot. You're welcome. So, what's the next step? You're definitely ready for the public. Well, I have been thinking about that a lot and I've been going over the numbers and counting my pennies... Literally. And, um, I don't have enough to open up my own shop, but I have scrounged up enough to make a coffee cart. So, getting a business license is pretty straightforward and I wouldn't have the overhead as much as I would as opening up my own shop, so... If I can't create somewhere for people to go, I'll just have to go to them. I have nothing left to teach you, my young padawan. Huh? Yeah. I don't know. It's from Star Wars? I just heard it somewhere, I like the sound of it. It means I'm proud of you. Oh well, thank you. You're welcome. To Clare's coffee cart! Mm-hmm. So good. Can I get a triple, half-caf, one and a quarter pump hazelnut, breve latte with no foam upside down with a dusting of cinnamon? Uh yeah, of course! So that's a... triple half-caf, pump at a quarter of hazelnut, a breve latte upside down, no foam with a dusting of cinnamon. Coming right up! What was the name on that? It's Mike. All right Mike! It'll be up in just a moment. Order up for Mike! So, that is a triple, half-caf, pump and a quarter of hazel nut, breve latte upside down, no foam and just a dusting of cinnamon. I hope have a great day! It's actually really good. Thank you! Come again! I was thinking we could put a couch over there, and a few wingback chairs with little mini side tables in the corners, to make up different conversation areas. Then the counter would go over there, and then the water hookups would be installed right over here, and then we could have a desert case for muffins and scones and other treats. I just think this space is perfect! It would be pretty fancy. Yes! Wait... are you just saying that to make me happy? When's the last time I said anything to make you happy? I knew it was great. I knew it! So. It is a great space. But, is this something you can afford? I know you've had a great few weeks but I don't want you to get ahead of yourself. I know, it's a big move and I don't have the money to put down on a deposit yet, but I know how I can get there. Okay, I'm listening. Ellis Winston the First and "Coffee Korner!" And I just stopped listening. What? Why? It's a great plan. A positive review is money in the bank. It will guarantee me enough customers to get things going, and the coffee cart has been doing great! All I need from him is a good review and I can do the rest. It's not that I think you aren't good enough, but this Ellis guy sounded like a real jerk. And did he even taste your coffee the last time? No. No, he didn't. And what did he tell you to do with it? Pour it down the drain. Yes, he did. What makes you think you can get him to come out and give you another try? Because people love a comeback story. It's not just good for me. It's good for him. He needs new things to write about, And this will give him something. No one has ever come back from a bad review, This would give his readers something groundbreaking to read about, and it will boost excitement for both "Coffee Korner" and Clare's coffee shop! Well, you make some good points. I just don't want you to be disappointed if this doesn't work out. It will work. It has to work! My dreams are dying the death of a THOUSAND SCREAMS! So we have like 863 left to go? I have not begun to scream, do you know why? Because your dreams are dead? Because my dreams ARE DEAD! Look, you knew it was a bit of a long shot right? Yes. You also knew he's a pretty tough customer. So hard. Honey, this is why I didn't want you to get your hopes up. Too late! For some reason I thought you might not take it well if it didn't work out. Why God? Why! Look, that guy is a jerk. Who cares what he says? He's just some dude who probably lives in his parents basement, and criticizes people for doing things that he wouldn't even try to do. What does opinion matter anyway? You're still doing great with your coffee cart right? It might take a little longer, it doesn't mean your dreams are dead, it just means some pretentious wanna be, didn't write you back. But he did write me back. What? Oh yeah. He's coming to the coffee cart on Tuesday. So he's giving you another chance? Mm-hmm. So... what was all this? Oh, this was just a preview in case he wrote me a bad review. Remind me to pass on the actual show. No need. There isn't gonna be a show because I know what I'm doing now, and I'm going to nail it. I sure hope so, or my ears may die the death of a thousand screams! Your face... your face... I'm sorry, I'm sorry I love you... Here you go. Have a great day now! Mr. Winston! I'm so glad to see that you came out! Mm-hmm. Blueberry? Really? Yes, it's actually our most popular drink. I think you'll find that the blueberry pairs well with our local espresso roast. Would you like me to get one started for you? No. I'll just take a large latte to go. Okay, one latte to go. Alrighty, one latte. You have a great day now! So, you're sure he liked it? It's hard to say, He's not the most pleasant person in the world. Maybe it's all the caffeine. Maybe. Although, if that's him hopped up on caffeine, without it, I think you'd have to have someone check his pulse, to make sure he was actually alive. So he didn't say he liked it? No. Did he smile? Definitely no. Did he make some sound like "Mmm..." Not that I heard. But you think he liked it? I do. Hit "refresh." Nothing yet. Look I don't mean to be a bummer here but, what makes you think he liked it? Oh. He drank it. Right. Which he would have to do to taste it, right? Yes. But he walked by a trash can and he didn't throw it away. He actually took another drink. Now, why would he do that, and not give me a good review? Hit "refresh" again. Still no update. He updates the same time every week? Yes. For the lack of all of his other social graces, he's actually quite punctual with his blog. It should be online any minute now. Oh! I think we have something! Okay! What does it say? No wait! Let me read it. No, I don't... I can't... you read it to me. Are you sure? No... Yes... No... Yes... Yes. I mean... What did he say? "As my faithful readers well know, I am NOT one to give out second chances, and now I know why..." Oh Clare. I'm so sorry. What? What, is it bad? Did he actually write a bad review? I don't get it, I mean... everything I did, it was perfect. I did what I was supposed to do... I gave him the drink, he drank it, he drank the whole thing so... I mean... Why would he do that, and give me a bad review? He actually wrote something bad? Yes. I'm sorry honey, it's pretty bad. Well... Let's look at this some other time. There's no reason to read it now. It's really bad. Yes. It is. It's just his opinion. People have been loving your drinks for weeks now. There's no way people are gonna stop coming to you just because some jerk with an internet connection, says he doesn't like it. So it might take you a little longer to get your shop. You're gonna get there. This is barely even a set back, I know it! What? Oh yeah. Yeah, you're right. I mean, everything's gonna be okay. Are you gonna be all right? Yeah, I'm just, you know, a little disappointed. I just thought that I had this one. But you're right. Everything is gonna be just fine. You know, it has been a long day, and I think that I am just going to turn in for the night. I hope you understand. Oh, of course. Of course I do. You know, everything is going to be okay. This is just a small bump in the road to world domination. I know. Thank you, for being such a good friend. Of course. Now I might call you for lunch tomorrow, that is if the cart isn't too busy. Because you're still going to have scores of loyal customers waiting for you from the first. You'll see. And the dream is, three... two... one... DEAD! That's it. It's literally all she wrote. Hello there. Oh. Hello. I'm sorry I don't mean to bother you, I I see that you're closing up for the day. I wondered if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Oh, sure. Actually, today's been a little slower than I'd planned. So I'm just gonna have to throw out these grounds anyway so What can I get for you... Oh, uh... William. My friends call me Bill. Okay Bill, what can I get for you? Well, I'm afraid I don't have much here, I don't know if I can afford one of your fancy drinks. How much for just a small cup of coffee? Don't be silly Bill. Honestly, you're doing me the favor. I mean like I said I had a ton of these grounds, that we're just gonna have to be thrown out, and now I have less to take back, so try whatever you'd like. Well, I used to love a good latte, back when times were better. I used to get one every morning before I went to work. Okay, I can do that. So tell me Bill, what kind of business are you in? Well, I'm uh... I'm between jobs right now. I used to be in finance... that was several years ago. The firm that I worked for went out of business, and it just doesn't seem to be a call for people my age. Jobs can be hard to find. They usually go to younger people. It can be pretty tough out there. Actually, I had an interview today. Really? Well how did your interview go? Not that well actually, they were polite and everything but, I don't think I got the job. I've been in a lot of interviews over the years. I've gotten pretty good at reading the room. Well, hopefully this will make you feel better. Here you go, Bill. Thank you. You're welcome. Hmm... That's as good as I remember. It's funny you know, how we learned to take things for granted. How we can have something and not realize how good it is, until we can't have it anymore. Not just the big things either, simple things. Something as simple as... a cup of coffee. And this, this is a really good cup of coffee. It's not as easy to find as you might think. Oh no. No, that is not necessary. I'd really like to pay you for this. I know I can't give you what it's worth, but I really like to give you what I can. No. It's a gift, Bill. Now I know a gentleman such as yourself has more manners than to refuse a gift from a lady. Well thank you... um, Oh, Clare. Thank You Clare. You've made a hard day, a little better. You know what Bill, you have too. I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I work hard, I try my best, so why aren't things working out? Is God mad at me? No Clare. God's mad, or angry with you. Life's circumstances just don't work out the way we want them to. It doesn't mean that God's angry with us. Are you sure? Pretty sure. What could it be? I don't know, life circumstances, timing maybe? Just because you've hit a couple bumps in the road doesn't mean your dreams can't become a reality. Tell me, why is opening a coffee shop so important to you? Well.. To tell you the truth, it wasn't my dream at first. I really wanted to be a chef and own my own restaurant. What changed? It turns out, I'm a really terrible cook, I mean really bad. There have been many reports of certain "sicknesses." I mean no one's actually used the phrase "food poisoning" but you get the idea. Oh. I can see how that can put a damper on opening a restaurant. So why a coffee shop? Because it's the closest thing that I could get to what I really wanted to do. I really wanted to have a special place where people could come and make their day better. I wanted a place where they could have a bad day and make it bearable. Have a good day and make it great! I really wanted to offer something to they really enjoyed and they looked forward to. It feels amazing, when you can make something for someone and they really love it. You've just become a part of their life, in a real way! ...and I wanted it to be fancy. Why did it have to be fancy? I wanted to offer something that they couldn't get anywhere else. I wanted something that they had to come to me to get. So you wanted it to be special. Yes! I want to offer something special You know Clare, something doesn't have to be fancy to be special, or valuable. It could be a smile, a warm greeting, or a good cup of coffee. Hey, You got a couple of minutes? I'd like to show you something. Sure. This kitchen used to be the heart of our church. This was a place where everybody would come with their families, for a meal and fellowship. There wasn't a weekend on the calendar, where somebody's name wasn't on the schedule. But, as times changed, people got interested in other things, and got busier, It began to get used less and less. Until eventually it was just an empty shell. I'd really like to see this space become alive again. To see people really use it and enjoy it. What do you think about that, Clare? Yeah. I think that sounds like a great idea. I'm really glad to hear you say that. Because over the years I've been carving out money in our annual budget to put towards this space, and I've been praying that God would help me find how to use it again. Now I don't want to be overdramatic, and I don't want to pressure you anyway, but I think God's quite possibly given me my answer. And what did He say? You don't have to whisper, God can still hear you. Yes, of course. So what did He say? Clare, I think you, should consider making this your coffee shop. Ohhh... Hello, can I help you find something? Oh hey! You wanted to open a coffee shop right? Yes indeed I did, and still do. Well great! Now, as I recall, you were looking at some budget options. Has that changed? Today I believe I will take your "Super Steam 9000." Well great! Should I have an attendant bring that one down for you? Now, as memory serves, you had said that you have some mildly scratched or dented "Super Steam 9000 for sale. Are any of those available? Absolutely! Well then, I will take your most dented, that still works properly, good sir! I think we can arrange that. Well then that would be, as they say in baseball, a "Grand Slam!" I'm pretty sure that's just a Denny's breakfast item? Yeah, you're probably right. Well, I think we're as ready as we're ever going to be. Yes! Thank you, for everything that you have done. My pleasure. I do expect preferential treatment though you know. Of course. My own mug. Absolutely. A reserved place for me at the counter. You got it. Maybe a plaque with my name on it. No problem, just as soon as you tell me what a plaque is? I'm really proud of you, you know. I know. I think... No one's actually gonna call this place fancy, but... I think it's gonna be great! Yes. It is. One decaf blueberry cappuccino with light foam. What? Just kidding, A cup of house blend for Mrs. Johnson. Just one sugar. This is not what I meant when I said I wanted my own place at the counter. And where's my plaque? I still don't know what that is. Here you go, Mrs. Johnson be careful now it's very hot. Thank you, sweetie. And here's a little something for you... For me? Thank you! Mrs. Johnson! You're gonna spoil me! Ohhh... Have a great Sunday! Thank you. I've got to tell you Clare. You far exceeded our wildest dreams! The coffee shop is doing great. We're actually turning a small profit and what's more important people are really loving it! Well, that's good to hear. You know, if things continue this way, I'm sure that maybe we can invest in some of that fancier equipment you were talking about. Maybe even hire some part-time people. Well, I know Kate would appreciate that. She keeps going on about some kind of... plaque? I don't know, I thought she was joking at first but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm sure we can figure something out. Well, that's how we feel about how things are going. How are things going for you? Great! Yeah, I really feel like things are going well. I love the drinks that we're making. I love seeing everyone each week, and I really think that we're becoming a special part of everybody Sunday, and that's all I've ever really wanted. Do you think you might want to invest in some of that fancy equipment and maybe add some things to the menu? Yeah, there's this new pour over system that makes an outstanding house blend, It's pretty pricey though, but I've been to a demonstration and it makes coffee that is out of this world! There's only one other place that has it and it is 30 miles away. That sounds really interesting! Tell you what, why don't you put together proposal, and I'll take it to the board, and we'll see what we can do. Is there... something else you'd rather do? I was just thinking... I was just thinking that if word got out about our new system, we're gonna get people all around coming in just to try our coffee. I mean we're going to get all sorts of people to come inside this building, that may not have otherwise ever set foot in a church. That's a great reason for giving it a try. But what about the people that won't come inside the building? Excuse me, Are the drinks really free? Why yes they are! What do you feel like this morning? Which ones? It doesn't say which ones are free. Oh, well that's because they're all free. So you can try whatever you like free of charge compliments of Christian Community Church. Do I have to listen to a preacher? No. Not if you don't want to. But, I mean you're always free to join us for service anytime. Well, in that case, I'd like to try the blueberry latte. It sounds fancy! Alright! You know, I like to think of it more of as... special.
