Come on. You told me to build our house here. If I had invested the money we would've at least had an income. With the current situation no one is prepared to buy it. There is plenty of work abroad, it won't be difficult. It's my responsibility and the decision is final. Everything will be okay, I'll return with money. Do you really think I'm not worried? As though I could just abandon them. There is no work here. Otherwise my boss wouldn't close the shop. They won't even hire me in factories. You think it's that simple? I'm only worried for my wife and daughter. I have no choice. Hopefully I'll make enough money for them to join me. Otherwise I'll return and work something out. Should you extend a friendly hand They won't stretch one back For the cold is too bitter, too harsh For the cold is too bitter, too harsh The breath coming out of your chest Turns into a dark cloud That stands before your eyes, like a wall. When your own breath is like this What can you expect What can you expect from your distant or close friends? What do you expect from your distant or close friends? The breath coming out of your chest Turns into a dark cloud That stands before your eyes, like a wall When your own breath is like this What do you expect What do you expect From your distant or close friends? What do you expect From your distant or close friends? Hi. Good evening. - Do you have anything to eat? - Food's finished and there's no tea. Well, at least a place to sleep? Do you have any ID? Yeah, don't worry. The bed in the corner. Need a blanket? I've got one, thanks. - Hi. - Hi. You traveling too? What's your name? Ali Reza. What's yours? They call me Marhab (Welcome). What do you do? I work in a garage. - What's your job? - I'm a mechanic. What kind? Just a mechanic. I haven't seen you around. I'm not exactly local. Do you live here? Yeah. - Where were you before? - Up north. I had a job there. The weather was no good. Ever been? No. It's only good for fun, not for work. You sleep at night but in the morning... you're all wet. As though you've... Forget it! So you wander a lot? Yeah, like a gypsy! Any rooms to rent out here? Yeah, but not to strangers. - Not to strangers? - No strangers. - Is that why you sleep here? - Me? - Is that why you crash here? - No, that's not the reason. What is it? It happens. I'm off to work. - Are you coming back tonight? - I don't know. Is it OK if I leave my stuff? Sure, don't worry. I repair cranes. I'm pretty good. We don't need anyone. No work. I'm one of the best! - I'm a specialist. - No. Any news from the police? We don't hear from him. He sends no money. What a husband! If the police had any news, they'd tell us. What's the point in checking? The bastard's been gone for six months! Come on, let's eat. You're like me, no luck with husbands! We don't need anyone. Jobs are announced in the papers. - I read the papers yesterday. I'm here! - Should've signed up before. You have to wait again. - What's your job? - I'm the guard. I'm responsible here. - I want to talk to your boss. - I am the boss! - We don't have an understanding! - Just leave, there's no work here. - Let me see the boss. - Go home. - Why home? - We don't hire anyone. I've learnt this trade, I'm an excellent mechanic. Go somewhere else. Just leave! Hi. What's up? - Hi. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You look worried. Is your ship sinking? Don't worry. It'll be OK. - What will be OK? - In the end, it all goes well. Thanks anyway. - No one will buy this! - What's that supposed to mean? Go inside. Don't haggle, you're not the buyer! How much for the chain? How much? Those shoes. The brown ones. How much for this? Hello. How are you? You OK? Anyone home? I've brought you this... Your mother forgot it at the market. I thought you might need it. See if you like it? It's yours. I think it's the right size. Hello, Miss. Who are you? What do you want? I've brought this for you, for the kid. Her mother forgot it. - I thought I should bring it. - That's not your problem! It belongs to her, what should I do with it? Throw it away! Burn it! Who cares? Let her try it on. - Don't break her heart. - Leave us alone! This kid has parents! Goodbye. Marhab, come down! What are you doing? I need a break. I'm feeling low. Why up there? There's plenty of room here. You crazy? - The air is cool here. - Rat bastard! Think of me! Stop it! I've had trouble getting you this job! I just want to smoke. Go somewhere else, why over there? Big boss is here, run for it! Give me a break, come down! What the hell?! Always Marhab, Marhab! Chill out! I'm fine. Here, smoke it. Leave me a blow back. Chasing that girl again, aren't you? At least I can. Why don't you? You don't have the fling. Always work! Miserable dog, look at yourself. - You're fading out! - So what? I have no choice! My dad's sick. I have to work twenty-four seven. Not like you, I can't just chase this and that. Running wild, for what? - Work to your grave! - Get lost. Don't take it seriously, my parents died. - You were only a kid. - Does that mean I shouldn't breathe? Just can't help it. You were raised this way. Can't enjoy yourself! Do you even know what a good time is? It's sitting here and checking out what happens behind closed doors? You don't get it. - Leave him alone. - Who? - Your dad, let him go. - Get lost! You're crazy! You know, parents, once their old... you should forget about them. It's not worth it. Let him go ahead and die. Rat bastard talks rubbish! You're full of shit! Let's go have a good time. Where's that? Leave it up to me. - I want to know where and what for. - You coming or not? That's all you care about? Stop grinning. Happy face! Check this out. Pretty smooth. Stand over there. Step forward a little. Stand still. Looking slick! Check out this guy. Look at this. It's you! The sleepy monster! Hang on. You monkey! I left it for the other guy! - Ali Reza. - What? - You dropped something. - Where? - Just there, look. - Where? - On the ground. - Can't see! - I think it's your dad. - Bastard! What's wrong? Go on, spit it out. Nothing. - I think her husband died. - Serious? That's not bad. She's available. Talk to her. Why are you following me? I was passing by... No, I won't start with a lie. Start what? What do you want? My condolences about your husband. I was by your house. I'm the guy who was stopped by the police. I know. When I'm off work, I sit across by the rail tracks. At least let me carry your stuff. Don't you have a wife? No, why? Nothing, just asking. What are you doing here? It's my day off. I thought I'd just... wander around. What are you doing here? I forgot something. Why are you following me? - Hi, boss. - Hi. Why aren't you at work? - I have a few minutes left. - Your watch is wrong. - My watch is working. - No, you're late! - My watch still has a few minutes. - You can't go on like this. - What have I done? - Go on like this, and you're fired. I wanted some cash up front. You have to put it in writing. Right, so they can think about it! I've tried. Who cares? - This is no way to work. - Paperwork! I need cash. All you do is smoke, drink tea... Do you know what a friend is? Have you ever had one? - No, you're no human! - You don't exist! - Stop showing off! - You just don't get it! You got me the job. I've shut up because of you. For how long? I need cash. - How much? - I need 10 or 20. Can you get it? - Give me a week. - How will you get it? - Easy, I'll work it out. - The boss has to pay me, not you! - I'm your friend. - Small fry! All you need is cash. You don't have a pot to piss in! Don't show off like you're the boss. He's no pretty bimbo! The boss doesn't trust me any more because of you. I made a mistake telling you! I should've stood on my own two feet. Now you act like a creep! All because you got me a job! Listen to me, it's all over. You're a rat bastard! Fuck off! Rat bastard! - This is all I could get. - Thanks. Don't mention it. The bride should sign here. Sign there and there... The groom, sign here. I wish you all the best for the future. You may enter. - What are you doing? - I'm taking it apart. Should've started from the other end. Why reverse? It's done wrong. But it also works this way. More like a bag of marbles, worth nothing. - Don't worry, I'll sort it out. - Sort out what? It's in pieces! But it works this way! Only the other way! Now you haven't... Why is this in pieces? You've smashed everything. Come take a look. The ball bearing is broken, so is the gear box. How can I answer for it? Instead of sorting it out, it's broken. No one is good enough for you. - Is this how you work? - All broken things can be fixed. Don't worry, I'll fix it. - Fix what? - Leave it up to me. I've been working for two months with no pay. Only paperwork! You were absent for two days, and you're asking for pay! I took two days off to get married. Surely you'd do the same! Your family and marriage don't concern me. You're just looking for an excuse. I don't get it! You're tight when it comes to cash. You don't like me, but you don't... Cheeky bastard! Who the hell do you think you are? I don't get it. What's so cheeky? Arguing instead of admitting it's all broken. This is no job, it's a setup! Just keeps talking back! Listen... if you're not happy, find another job. - I will, once you've paid me. - Go work wherever you please. Just pay me for the last two months! I've never seen such a cheeky apprentice. I'm no apprentice. I'm a specialist. Sure! A specialist! How about I give up everything and work for free?! Satisfied? Give me a break, bloody hell! This is no way to treat me! Keep talking and I'll smash this on your head! You really have a problem! For every word I get a speech! Where's the respect for elders? Who should I see if I want you fired? Picking, twisting, on and on. Cheeky apprentice! It's not right, boss. Just pay up and I'll go. Suits me fine, get out! I said I'd go. How about paying me first? Up shit creek, unbelievable! Where are you going? You said you'd help me fix it! - Go fix your boss! - Is he back? Marhab! - Get lost! - Marhab! What do you mean, that night is gone? That dawn is announcing the day? What you see on the sky Is not the redness after dawn No, what you see Is no daybreak It's the mark of winter's slap On the sky's face It's the mark of winter's slap On the sky's face O partner, go prepare the wine For days and nights are all the same O, partner go prepare the wine For days and nights are all the same For days and nights are all the same Check this out! Look who's here. Sunshine himself! - You never look me up. - Look who's talking! You could have waited a few more years! Where were you hiding? - Around here, where else? - Oh yeah! I want to go. - Where to? - Abroad. Abroad?! You don't have a clue. - What if I go? - You? Never! How do you like that? Get serious. - I've made up my mind. - You're kidding. No, I really mean it. What will you do out there? There's plenty of work with good pay. Work? If you were a worker, you would work here, instead of arguing with the boss. I'm a hard worker. Just forget it. Plenty of work around here. Why not try again? No, my mind is made up. I'm out of here. What's the point? To know a trade and be unemployed. What's the point? I've worked all my life. I'm a technician. I can fix anything. Do you know what I mean? I'm a mechanic. I'll repair anything. Why go through all this trouble? But I don't like to work. Well, sometimes, not always. I prefer a good time. Too much work ruins you. Am I right? It's obvious. Especially if you're not given your rights, and no one is there to see it. After all the work, why are you still here? I was just beginning to settle down. After a rough, homeless... restless life. The bastards won't let me. Food's finished, there's no tea. Here's an example. Two weeks ago he got back, but he doesn't dare go home. Every morning he goes and stares at his house. As soon as it's dark, he's back. He's a nuisance to me! All he does is drink tea. He left in search of money, but he's back penniless. Not a single coin to pay me. Why doesn't he go home? His wife lives nearby. In the middle of nowhere. So why doesn't he go home? He's not even worried about his kid. He has a little girl. What's the point? They won't respond to your greeting Air is gloomy Doors are closed Heads ducked into collars Hands hidden Breaths are clouds People worn out, heavyhearted The trees, nothing but crystallized skeletons Air is gloomy Doors are closed Heads ducked into collars Hands hidden Breaths are clouds People worn out, heavyhearted The trees, nothing but crystallized skeletons The earth dispirited The high dome of sky has sunken The moon and the sun are overcast It's winter It's winter In memory of MEHDI AKHAVAN SALESS
