In other news, we still have no word on the missing campers reported last Saturday. After combing the forest area, where the campers were last seen, search and rescue workers are not optimistic. Vampire control teams have been called in. Early reports suggest that this may be the latest in a series of vampire attacks in our city. First responders to the scene in Cordova report coming into contact with at least three vampires, but finding signs that there may be more in the area. Well since the development began back in the early '30s for a vaccine or cure, we've actually made many advances towards that goal. What most people don't realize, however, is that the virus mutates like the flu, or any other virus. People need to keep track of the vampire force in their area, just like you do with sex offenders and other criminals. I talk to people all the time who tell me they have no idea vampires were in the area. Originally it was intended as a way for one to protect themselves from the viciousness of an enraged bear attack. However, some of the ideas and technologies have superseded the needs of simple bear attack protection. Welcome to Northern Mississippi. I'm Evan Shandling, and it's here that I've chosen to film my thesis for graduation. Here's where I'll fully explore the struggles of the working class of today's economy, known to see what they're really going through due to our current climate and per our latest administration. Not only that, but I'll do so by showcasing employees in one of the most dangerous, and often, thankless jobs there really is, vampire removal. Small business probably never looked clearer on film, I bet. Yeah, well this is the place, so let's go inside and hopefully meet everybody. Okay guys, I'll be interviewing you each by yourselves at different times during this week. A week! (Mumbles) boss man, ain't no way he makes it a week. Am I right, or am I right? Roy man, shut up. Yeah, anyway, we'll do several group sessions like this, when we can too. Okay Carl, if you could just go ahead and sit right there, in the middle, okay... Yeah, just like that, okay now Kevin and Eddie, can you just get in the shot. Right here? All right everybody. On the count of three, I'm gonna need you to say hi, we are At Stake Vampire Solutions. Ready, one, two, three. Hi, we are At Stake Vampire Solutions. Okay, Carl, now that I got you here, I'm a little concerned. I get the sense that I'm not really wanted here. A few of the team don't seem too happy. That's not it at all man. You just saw which one of them owes me some money. It was a real question around here whether or not you'd show up. Bets were placed. Oh, okay. Seriously though, we did schedule some news reporters to do stories on us, it would've been good exposure for us. Good for business, but at the last minute, these professional news guys. No show, and that's a tough pill to swallow. So it was really highly debatable that you'd show up. I bet on you, but I do need to ask you something. Do you have some kind of death wish son? Because following us around, not gonna be too peachy for you. Matter of fact, it's gonna get nasty, yes, yes. It's just after 10:00 PM. We're responding to a call from a park ranger and local police here at Arkla Lakes. Some campers reportedly haven't come back as expected. Okay, so how do they attack? I mean, are we just gonna get rushed by a bunch of them? Well they are scavengers, so you never truly know sometimes. I think the answer you're looking for is if we get rushed, can we handle it. And that would be a yes, we'll fuck 'em up real good with a face full of glass marbles. What, you're shooting marbles? Yeah, we're a small business, that's what you get. Money's tight, so we have to work as cheaply efficient as we can, these are modded paint ball guns. We kicked up the air compression and freeze our barrels (Mumbles) for firing glass marbles. They don't just turn them into riot guns, essentially either. Vampires, being soft dying tissue for the most part, we can really tear them up, slow them down at least. Huh, that's still a good thing. Fuckin'-A you're right. That's our Roy, professionally comforting with words. I hope we're not hunting a bear like the last time. Yeah, I nearly forgot about that. Yeah, that was some shit right there. Oh come on now, it was a fun night from what I can remember. Yeah, that's because you're a psychopath. So firing modded paintball guns worked on a bear? Yeah, that's my thoughts exactly. It sure slowed his ass down enough for us to scatter. Well, at least it's not a bear. So it's definitely a vampire? Yes, yes. That definitely sounds like one of them. There may be more than one, the rest are just deaf. Hurry up. Hey, come on man, don't push me. I call point. I swear, that girl was just born in (Mumbles). If she didn't have this job, she'd probably want the one throwing the switch in the electric chair down in Texas. I heard that. What, you can't accept the fact that a girl wants to have a little fun. Shit I'll give you some fun. He's right at us, he's coming towards us. Sweep formation! Slow approach! Oh shit! (Mumbles). Whoa, come here Evan, get a shot of that shit! That's vampire shish kabob right there. Watch out, I got this. Oh, holy shit! Guys, still got some more campers to find. It's just after 11:00 PM. I think we found our campers. I got this, come on, let's have us a look see. Whoo, damn. Oh my God. (Mumbles) let's do this. You too boy, get your knife out. You may wanna get a close up of this. Or not. This ain't nothing but divine justice, don't think of it as anything less. Now cut him up! All right Carl, I would like to start off today by debunking a few of these false perceptions about vampires. Okay, where would you like to begin? Well I think a good place to begin, and I think one of the more popular myths, yet one I've never really seen anything about, really, is vampires dying from direct sunlight. Well that's because it's complete bullshit. You are never gonna see a vampire burst into flames, or explode into a gooey mess because of exposure to sunlight. Vampires wouldn't even come out at night if sunlight alone could kill them, because the damn light that comes off the moon is what? Reflected sunlight. Now, vampires during the daytime are more affected by the heat. It be like taking a sponge from under the ocean, totally saturated in water, and uprooting it, and throwing it onto the street. It's gonna dry out, it's gonna die, it's gonna crumble away. Vampires are creatures that need to stay saturated also. But of course it's not water they need, it's blood. Okay, so what about in colder climates though? What would we see them about during the day then? Well, not too cold, they don't hold up against the freezing temperatures any better than anyone else. What you need to understand here is that the blood they feed on, still dies within a 24 hour period. It doesn't provide any circulation, it doesn't generate any heat. We used to use those thermal energers to track vampires, but that didn't work out so well It damn near got us killed it failed so bad. What we're finding in this business is more evidence to this questions debate really, as to whether vampires are purely instinctive, or do they retain some of their previous human intelligence and memory. It's a deep argument, and both sides make some valid points. We're here with Detective Richardson who is only one of seven officers stationed in the area. Detective Richardson, I'm curious to a veteran police officers views of vampire removal services, the local AS:VS company, especially. Maybe you'd even like to speak on behalf of your coworkers if you feel you can, you know. Just whatever opinions of the whole situation you'd like to share. I'll give you more than an opinion. I can tell you without a doubt, not a single police, or rescue officer, that I know, or have talked to, wants to mess around with the vampires. Yeah, we have our directives from above, but not a single one of us is crazy enough to want that risk. I could get stabbed, or shot, or cut up taking down some perps but I go to the hospital, and nine times out of 10, I'm gonna leave there, go home, and see my wife and kids. But you get one bite from a vampire, you're looking at losing a limb to amputation, dying, or even worse, turning into one of them. Well, screw that, these people up in Washington continually sticking their nose in our business down here. They wanna use state regulated authorities to start contracting all vampire removals. They want us to step up to the plate, and be this whole new type of marine core, but hey, this documentary you're doing here, I mean, as soon as they see what this company, AS:VS, is all about, see what they go through everyday and every night, they might do that. They might subsidize some folks, get better training for the ones all ready willing to do the damn jobs. Just treat them right, quit making so many ignorant-ass cut backs. So, Kevin as we're comparing the real life vampire to the fictionalized vampire, a popular topic that comes up is fangs. Do they really have fangs? No, they don't have fangs. What you'll see happen is they all end up with broken, or chipped teeth because they bite into anyone, or anything, they even eat the bones too. You know, man? So naturally, anyone who lives to still see a vampire always goes on about how awful they look, or how menacing their teeth is. I'm sure not before too long you start hearing all these stories and that's how you get all these vibes about these fang filled monsters. My name is O'Del Turner, I'm groundskeeper of Magnola Cemetery now for about 17 years. Mr. O'Del, please share any unique views you may have on vampires and a company like AS:VS. I don't know that I got too unique a view. Something that's always stuck with me about them, though, good many years ago, I worked for the big city zoo, two counties over in Ridgeland. I remember having to learn up on these particularly huge lizards they brought in from Indonesia, called them Komodo Dragons. They want us studied up on the fact that feeding them, and wrangling with them if we had to, would be far riskier than even being with the lions. Problem being that they have about the worse mouths you could imagine, full of jagged teeth and old festering meat just stays stuck up in there. Worst bacteria you could imagine gets backed up. And it's instantly in your bloodstream from the first bite. Now, you might get away from one after that first bite, might even let you go on purpose. But that's just them playing you for sport. They'll wait for that first bite to get at you, then they'll have a real go at you. Anyway, that's why I never ramble around the cemetery without my shovel. Done lost count a long time back how many vamps I've kept away from with this here fellow. Yes sir, I've definitely appreciated the AS:VS workers over the years. No matter how many employee changes they've gone through, they always do solid work. Now that Carl, he trains them right. They're not about trying to learn on them like some of the groups you hear about. Nope, they find them, they kill them, and that's the only way as I see it. So Kevin, I get that you're second in charge at AS:VS? Based on seniority, definitely. We're all pretty equal though. We better be, you know. Of course Eddie is still considered a trainee, but you know, he'll be up to speed in no time. That's if he hangs around. Man, I must have been in this place about 50 times in my four years on the job. I'm still amazed by all the artistry that goes into these huge headstones. I mean, they just don't make them like this anymore. Hope it down sound morbid or anything like that, I just appreciate the history. Nah, actually what I got out of your statement is that you're surprisingly clear headed at a time like this. And it's kind of wild to think that any of you could calmly think about something else. You get used to it. Ain't nothing but a thing. Ah, don't go lying now, guys. Yeah, some people just try to act angry or tough all the time, it's their facade. They don't want you to really know they're affected by anything at all. They're just really trying to hide what's really underneath. Fact is, we're all scared. I mean, we might speak or act a certain way on the outside, but inside, we're just like how you and Eddie over there look right now. All right, so we've been in the cemetery for maybe about an hour and a half now, and I can clearly hear that we are being surrounded. We're just being circled. There's just one of them, but he's playing with us pretty good. Okay, then just one is sizing us up. It's toying with us like an animal might. You can see that the AS:VS team has formed a circle with their backs to me, and they call this the keep formation because they are protecting me, a civilian, like a king atop a central tower refuge. This is getting wild. Oh boy, we got a faster one here. Show yourself fuckhead, come get some! I can't see shit, I don't have a shot. You're doing just fine Eddie, you keep your wits about you, and hold in your formation. That's all I need you to do right now. Just wait for it son, it will make a go at us. It's just getting its courage up. Oh shit no, it's using the headstones, I can kind of see it, and my camera can barely make it out. Which direction? Show us where. I think that it's just a couple in front of us now. Don't get giddy now. If we had some fuckin' night vision, this shit would be done by now. Amy, it is right in front of you! I'll circle around him. Amy, I can't say that's a good idea with this one. I got this, come on camera boy. Amy. Shit! Everybody break wide, cover Amy's back. Watch your lines of fire! You better know what the hell you're doing! Damn it, I think I missed. Whoo, it's on now! There he is! Well hell, check him out! I'm sure those neck shots are probably mine. I think if you dig those out, you'd see those were mine Boss Man. I wanna know who's aiming for his ass. You taking ass shots boy? No. Look at all those marbles in his ass. I didn't ass blast him, you did. Who cares, I'm happy the kid actually hit the target. True enough, you did good son, you did real good. So the marbles are laced with something that kills them, is that what.. No, we're waiting to see if any of his vampire friends come for him. Since nobody's coming, hold my gun! See, I save all my energy for the fight. But I know we all have our ways about us. Kevin, the vampire mythology's breaking down to a reality with every minute that I spend with you guys, and something that I've noticed is I've not seen or smelled a hint of garlic. So is that just yet another piece of fiction? You know, garlic has its uses, but so far a deterrent is not what it's made out to be. For centuries, garlic was always known as a blood thinner. Per actual facts that you come across, they used to stuff garlic in the mouths of the dead, and they would throw them inside the caskets before sealing them and burying them. Now before we had all these cutbacks, we were working with a veterinarian at a local pet hospital. He was all for helping us convert these tranquilizer guns into injecting darts of minced garlic. Never got to test them though, but still, I don't think it would do anything but slow them down. Now what really puts them on their ass is silver. Silver, really? Yeah, oh yeah, we surprised how well silver works. Do explain. You know what, all this talk about garlic, I'm getting kind of hungry, craving. You mind if we finish the rest of the interview at Italia Deli, it's a great little place in town. Uh, yeah, sure, I mean, as long as they'll sign the release for filming there. So the best garlic can do is sicken a vampire that drinks your garlic ingested blood stream, basically. But you said that silver was the real deal. I mean, how so? Silver, it's actually the most amazing element on earth. The reason we haven't eaten with wooden forks or spoons in since forever, because no bacteria or virus known to man, can survive longer than 10 seconds when exposed to it. Oh, there's something else too. They use silver to make mirrors. The reason most vampires don't like it, when broken into pieces, it becomes a very powerful weapon. Dear AS:VS, I hope you can shed some light and are hopefully in our corner over how a lot of funeral homes are charging double for reburials. Can we get this changed? Ah, the only double death tax. That is a pain in the ass though. A few years ago, at the state capitol, they pitched a fit about it, but there never was an actual law or bill passed. So, sadly they still can charge you twice. See, well, that's why I'm doing what everyone else does these days. Cremation? That's right, sir. I mean, burn me up, I can't stand the thought of being some ghoul up all night terrorizing folks because I got the cannibalism munchies, you know? You know what I wanna do? I wanna be put on this tall platform, like made out of wood, and then I wanna hold all my AS:VS gear, and just burn me up like ashes. You know, kind of like how they used to do with the medieval knights. But you know what would be even better? You put me on this wooden boat, and I can like hold my soul and then ya'll can just put me on a lake and just put me on fire. Just send off like the Vikings, you know what I'm saying? I mean, that's real warrior sendoff right there homie. Yeah man, that's the real Beowulf thing. You know, we'd have to even chain you down or mop your head off because we can't have you turning into a vampire on a burning boat and jump in water. You'd be a half-burned-up-ass vampire. That's true, you know, I'd hate to come back at all, but I sure don't want to be no crispy motherfucker running around, you know what I'm saying? There is that. Cremation. Cremation. Cremation. Hey, welcome to Oakdale Sanitarium, and we're in the basement now. We're about to do our third sweep here tonight. A lot of people commonly mistake the symptoms of vampirism with other diseases, such as mental dementia, and when that happens, they bring them to the asylums and sanitariums for treatment, instead of doing what needs to be done. Damn right. Right, like I said, we're about to begin our third sweep, we've all ready cleared floors one and two. All hospital crew and patients have previously been evacuated up to floors three and four. So if you follow us, we'll show you how we handle this particular infestation. Hell yeah. Up next on World's Wildest Vampire Hunts, we go on location as (Mumbles).. Man fuck Night Force. Hey, y'all Night Force is on TV. Abandoned railroad town. Then, we'll head further south to talk... Hey, I'm out. Man. You look very nice, Amy. Thanks. Yeah boss man, I need off tonight too. Because see, Amy's old man called, and I forgot to tell you that he can't make it. So I told him I'd take care of her for him. Um. He didn't mind though. That's bologna. You are such full of shit. My date would never talk to or approve you, Roy, for anything, and it's not a guy. Come here Evan. Hey, you got my full permission to follow Amy tonight instead of me, okay? I need lots of close ups, and tight action shots, please. Roy, sit your ass down and leave Evan alone. Well, I'm just trying to get some... I think everybody wants to... All right, shit. It's 10:30 and we're responding to a domestic call from Lita Willis's roommate. Now apparently, Lita's one of these girls that dresses all gothic and vampiric and all that bullshit. Anyhow, this is the first time her roommate thinks she may have actually came in contact with a vampire. So we're going to check out the situation. All right, we're arriving at the call, so we're gonna see what the situation is. And I can tell right away that it's a pretty stable situation. Now, I notice that her roommate ain't covered in blood, so that's a positive thing. So we can probably go ahead and leave all of our weapons out here in the car, except for our knives. Because domestically, the last thing you wanna do is go in all half cocked, you know what I mean? You end up cutting Granny's arm off or something. Now if this was a different looking type of situation, follow (Mumbles) or something like that, hell, we'd bring all of our weapons in, we wouldn't risk it. But this one looks like it may be all right. You the one that called? Hey, Roy Pickett, AS:VS. Now this filming won't be on national TV, right? No, no. Because if it even ends up on the internet, I will find you. Wait, I thought you said we could film here? No, it's cool, it's cool, everything's fine. Now, just calm down, please. I know you're emotional, but just tell us. Tell us what's going on so we can help you out. Lita, she came home from a friends house, she had blood running down on chest and her back. She locked herself in her bathroom, she won't come out. And I was about to take the doorknob off, but she started making these noises, like an animal. I've never heard it before, so I started to fear the worst, and I thought I'd call you guys. Well, how about you let me and my buddy, Eddie, here take a look at it, and we'll see if we can help you out. Yeah, okay, just you'll do your best not to hurt her, right? Oh yeah, of course, of course. This is fucked up, I'm starting to get kind of sick here. Well, suck it up, because if she's bitten, it ain't gonna get no better. All right, Eddie, before we get up here, I wanna make sure you keep your ... together, all right? Don't ... freak out on me. Evan, don't panic. Or, just be cool. Lita? Alita Wallace? It's Willis. Well I know that dumb-ass, we're checking for coherence. Lita honey, we're with animal control. We think you may have hit an animal on the way in, and we just wanna talk to you. Let me see that little toothpick you call a knife. It's sharp. I fuckin' know that. You in? Yeah. All right, you got my back? Yeah. Let's fuckin' do it. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! She ain't turned yet. Um, Roy, I think she's bit. Oh God, that looks awful. Yes, it does. Should I kill her? No, no, no, wait, she ain't turned yet Eddie, damn. She's pretty out of it though. By the looks of it, I'd say she got bit probably earlier on this evening, something like that. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and restrain her, because that's the best way to make sure if she does turn, she ain't gonna be taking a plug out of our ..., that's for damn sure. That's the best thing you can do. At least until we figure out what the ... going on. Eddie, look underneath that sink there, see if there's any peroxide or alcohol, or anything like that. All right, there's this. Gauze, just get whatever you can get me. Alita honey, this is gonna burn like a bitch but this is about all anybody can do for you right now. Lita? Eddie, go down there and make sure she don't come up here. Is she okay, what happened? Keep her downstairs, damn it. Oh God! Lita, Lita! Hey, it's cool. No, no, I need to get to her. No, it's fine, no. Let me help, Lita! Listen, listen, listen, the alcohol is burning, that's what it's supposed to do, all right. That means she's still alive, she's still with us. Okay, she's not a vampire, not just yet. But look, go downstairs. But I need to help her. I need you.. I need to get to her! That's not a good idea. No, I need to.. God damn it, Roy, hurry up! Uh, you guys, I had no idea that you guys had to act as EMT's too. I can't believe this bitch won't stop bitching and moaning. Well you better get yourself an MP3 player or something, because this is pretty routine. Now this is how it is. You know, if there's even a suspected bitten person, they don't call us out here. I guarantee you they call the cops, or an ambulance first. And as soon as they say the word vampire, that was the end of the conversation, right there. Okay, I've got the personal side to why they won't respond, but is there a legal side? Oh yeah, there's lots of legal bullshit involved. All right, for instance, okay, say you got a bitten person, and they get admitted to a hospital, or something, well if that happens, you're putting everybody there at risk. And say that person turns into a vampire, and they start attacking people, well then that protocol gets dead simple, they'll call a team like us in, and tell us just clean the place out. No prejudice, just clean it out, kill everything in there. When's the last time that happened? It ain't ever happened with us, but you know, they'll usually call in like a bigger, more established team. Well that outfit up there in Ridgeland, Knott Forest, they had a couple clean sweeps back in '99 and '06, I believe it was, they had an emergency center and a nursing home they cleaned out. You know them sons of bitches still cocky about that shit. I hate them bastards, I can't be around them more than 20 seconds, I wanna kick the shit out of them. Oh hey, she finally shut the fuck up. That's awesome. Yeah, but why? Does it really matter, as long as she stopped bitching and moaning, I'm cool with that. No, well this could be a lot worse. You ready? Nope. Let's get her! Hold her down, get her! Fuck! Hold her down! Holy shit! Holy shit! Oh, you ready? Who in the hell keeps turning off my Christmas lights? Damn, ain't you got no Christmas spirit? Shit! There, ho, ho, ho. So Roy, tell us about the training. The methods, or whatever the textbook protocol is for killing vampires, if there is one. Killing them killing them really. No, we do got a few tactical formations that Carl taught us from back in his military days. Did you know he's black ops? Son of a bitch is bad ass, I know he don't look it, but he is, yes sir. Tackle that motherfucker, damn. Anyhow, we stick mainly to the modified paintball guns and hand to hand weapons, because they're hell of a lot less expensive upkeep than guns are. ... with ammo going through the roof, and all this recession ... The upkeep on them is just crazy, can't afford it. You know, matter of fact, last time I used an automatic gun, it left a sour taste in my mouth. Son of bitch jammed on me. It about got me killed, luckily though, the vampires attacking, they didn't have much on them together, so I hit (Mumbles) in his head apart with a gun handle, it was funny as shit So I take it the paintball guns don't jam then? I mean, they're automatics too. That's a fair question, I hear you. Any gun nut ike myself will tell you though, if you keep 'em clean, you won't have much trouble. But then again, paintball guns ain't shooting cartridge shells either. There's ain't nobody reloading a jammed cartridge before some vampire bites his fuckin' balls off. For flat out efficiency though.. Catch that fuckin' ball! Damn these son of bitches are retarded. Okay, so back to the question. Which weapon do you think does the best job? Not to sound contradictory but it ain't no gun. Those sons of bitches are pain in the ass. They'll jam up on you, even the paintball guns. Hell, you gotta change out those CO2 cartridges, that will get you bit. You know I think, as far as I'm concerned, I like a nice large well balanced knife. That or a claw hammer. Them son of bitches, I tell you what, you know they're good if you wanna be quick, get the vampire coming, get the next one behind it, get to the side, you can do some damage with them bastards. Get you one of them machine rocking claw hammers, one of them that's got the ends are straight out, and not curved, that will hook in the bone and such. That shit will slow you down. They're made for doing damage, I tell you. Man, I'd go on for days about the way I done killed vampires. One time, me and Kevin got out on this service call, and there's this lady, she... Catch that fuckin' ball! What they asking about this time? I was wondering how the whole wooden stake to the heart myth was started. Because it seems that that one isn't true. Well, sir, that basically got started back in the day, I mean like way back in the day. And what it was is there was pretty much two classifications of people, you had the rich mo-fo's and you had the peasants who didn't have shit. So what they did, was since they didn't have any metal objects to use, they just got wood, and anytime they had a vampire problem, they just carve them out a sharp end on it, and stab them with it, they just used what they had. Hey man, I think I'd probably use the longest spear that I could find, that had thorns on them. Like the really long Jesus thorns. That'd be cool. I think I'd use my manly good looks to bag me a blacksmiths daughter, that way I could make metal weapons. There you go, be pretty sweet. Then we could make our own custom weapons for just destruction. I don't think it'd be that easy. How do you plan on paying? I could bring you hot chicks, because that's what I'm best at. What if they ain't hot enough? I tell you what, you need to just bring me some whiskey, or some homemade liquor, either one. You know what, I could make some dental tools and start pulling all the teeth out of dead people before we bury them. Oh man, that'd be pretty sweet. Then we could like make necklaces from vampire teeth, and bracelets. Now you're talking, I tell you what, we're gonna get rich you keep thinking that way. That's what's up. You guys are dumbasses. Are we not going inside? We've been sitting out here for a while. Remember when I told you we owe 51 Supply quite a bit for our supplies. I meant that literally. Sorry man, I didn't know you wanna go in. Yes sir, we got a pretty thick credit line going with them. Okay, so why are we just sitting here then? I'm waiting for around closing time, which is right about now, I'm gonna drop this check off, and then I won't have to worry about it clearing until after 2:00 tomorrow. You wanted to know how much we struggle to stay afloat, well this is a good example for you, right? Having this business is all about timing. Pulling triggers, paying bills. At Stake Vampire Solutions, this is Kevin speaking, how may I help you? On Starlanding Road, right? Yeah, I know exactly where it is. At the barn? Oh, in the farmhouse itself. Yeah, well we can check both, no problem, of course. No, sir, exactly what you've been doing. Just keep exactly what you've been doing. Have you checked anybody for wounds? Get everybody safety accordingly? Very good, we should be there in about the next 30 minutes or so, maybe less. Thank you. Yeah, we appreciate you calling us, thank you sir. All right, bye. What you got? Some idiot teenagers is hid out in the barn, over there at Starlanding Road. Over there by the train tracks. They're in there smoking dope, and apparently, they spotted two vampires. Now, the kids father said that he checked everybody for wounds, but how they sounded over the phone, it sounds like it should be a legit call. Evan, you're turning out to be a pretty good luck charm, you know it? Any other week, we would have had a week full of false alarms by now, cool. It's 6:42 PM, all ready dark here, and actually a bit cold outside, winter's definitely settling in. But even if it wasn't, I think the hairs on my arm would still be standing, from the looks of this place. Amy, on the job, you seem to be more of the hardened team member. This is only your year and a half mark, correct? Are you calling me callous? Uh, no. I'm just fucking with you, keep your panties on. Wait, did you actually just smile? What smile, why don't you shut the fuck up before you get eaten. Okay gang, I see no sign that the vampires have been here. It looks like a false alarm, damn it. I mean, what are the signs that we'd be looking for anyway, in this barn? Well, no vampire's gonna call this place a home, and keep it clean. There'd be blood splattered everywhere, small dead animals, at least some bones. There ain't none of that here. All right, let's go check out the house. Hey guys, I don't mean to slow you up or anything, but I've gotta go change the batteries on my camera, I left some back in the car, can I go? Go ahead, you're not gonna miss anything. Come on, let's go. You guys get a lot of false alarms? Sometimes. Gosh, do you at least get to charge them for making you come all the way out here. Carl does all the paperwork. You look kind of pissed off that you didn't get to kill a vampire. Well, we don't have any other calls to go on. Where'd you say those batteries were? I left them in the... Oh shit. I saw it, I saw it. Guys! Hey Evan, does that thing have night vision on it? I don't know if it has it, but if it did, we'd just probably drain the battery faster anyways. Guys! Oh okay, thank God, I think they heard you. I hope so, there's more than one. You're sure? Does it look like I'm kidding? What's up Amy? Looks like we're fixed to have some fun, there's at least two over there. Oh shit. Just when I was about to get mad over another prank call. Man I was really getting used to the idea of a prank call. I do not wanna have to circle the vehicles for this guys. Huh, me either, I don't trust old Eddie's aim yet. We won't have any windows left. Yeah, like it's his aim I'm worried about. Dang it, we are gonna have to do this the hard way, guys. What's that mean? It means I'm gonna die in your movie, Evan. Evan, get your stuff together. Get inside the vehicle as soon as we start. Secure yourself, because this is probably gonna get nasty. We'll get over here. Get in! Is everything okay? Yeah, I guess so, everybody good? Whatever. Did you get all that? Yup, sure did. Intense and awesome, huh? Hey, I think you're smiling again. Shut the fuck up. All right, so Amy, you've got to be the perfect persona to ask this of. What do you think about the general public's false perception, or you know, that whole draw towards the pretty vampire mythology? And why would I be the perfect one to ask that of? I hate it, I can't stand any of that shit. Vampires are just ravenous, nasty-ass creatures with no sense of hygiene. No sense of fashion, and they sure as fuck aren't socialites bitching about (Mumbles) between sucking ass at skateboard tricks. Yeah, I'd figured you'd have the better answer on that one. So, let's take it to another topic. Coffins and crypts. Sure enough all ready, that that's just centuries old, if true. Well, do you have anything to add? It's retarded. Vampires are basically walking cases of brain and syphilitus. They're like Alzheimer patients. They know enough like when they need shelter, but they don't know where they had it last. So barring the smart ones, most of them just act like animals, then? Right. I gotta go. Are you going on a call? No, just a meeting. Okay, do you think I can maybe tag along? Hey Pam, thanks for doing this with us today. Vampires are third on the list of squatters, believe it or not. There's homeless, then drug addicts, and then vampires. Yeah, it seems like they'll move into any vacant building available to them. Yeah, I was telling him that earlier. Were you wanting this film speaking to the economy? About eight months ago, I ran this diagnostic graph. And what I found was that as the home foreclosure rate increased, so did the home break in rates. 63% of those homes, vampires were found. And yet another strike against our administration, and ignorant laws. Oh, I'm no political person. But it's obvious that the economic climate that we've been in, is causing an increase in the vampires in our community. Naturally, we don't mind the work. But the over all situation doesn't bode well for our town. I especially don't like the thought of those fuckers nesting in places where people wanna raise their kids. You know, I couldn't agree with you more on that one. Hey internet followers. This question is from Barbara Jean. Why does Hollywood make films that glorify vampires like they are superheroes? Is it going to make a whole gen-generation want to start being vampires? Come on, that's a good question. It's common sense. You haven't noticed that Hollywood glorifies the wrong things? It doesn't strike you as odd that you go and see films with vigilantes, muscle headed one-man armies taking out everyone? Or soap operas showcasing the glories of whoring around the entire city? Fucking idiots man. She didn't mean that, she's just ... a bitch Personally, I really like those Wesley Snipes movies. I mean, if I was gonna be a vampire, it'd be that motherfucker, but I mean, you guys do know that vampires don't know jiu jitsu and kung fu, all they wanna do is eat you. News flash people, movies aren't about life lessons. So get it clear. But.. On second thought, you know what, be as stupid as you like, job security, okay. I was just wondering, what, if anything, have you seen on the job that might make you consider quitting? Nothing. And it's directly because of the many instances I've seen of an elderly couple being attacked. Each time it looked like they didn't even fight back. I'm getting on age myself, and I refuse to become complacent. Lounge around the house, watch soap operas during the day, and go to bingo at night, no, no. I'm staying active. Well, I don't know about making me quit but I seen a vampire eating a man's penis off once, that was pretty fucked up. I almost quit when my nephew was killed. Didn't even want him working with us, but I knew he wasn't gonna get a job doing much else. Still remember him walking through that old church we were in. He had his handgun and he was hollering. I'm gonna peace-out you bitches ... (Mumbles) Three vampires rushed at him and tore him apart, before Carl and I could even get off one shot at them. I credit Carl for keeping me through the weekend, help me staying with it. I don't like seeing... I don't like seeing kids half eaten. A fuckin' vampire dude, that's bad enough. All right so, break down this call for me. This lady calls, says she met this guy online, made a date with him, then for a few nights in a row, he kept showing up with blood on him, asking for an invitation to get in. I'm thinking stalker who's obsessed with old vampire myths, there's plenty of those people around. Yeah man, I mean, that's what I was thinking. I mean, any vampire I've ever heard of would at least try and break in and eat the bitch. Hear that America? Vampires just don't wait around to be invited into your house, just more fiction. Well I wouldn't write it off completely yet. I mean, it's still possible, although I think it's really slim in this case. But history does support some stories of intelligent, old world vampires seeking invitations. Many years ago, they learned to dress like royals garnering invites to the gatherings. While the instinctive vampires would just try storming the castle walls, and they'd just be killed immediately. But these intelligent vampires, they can feed pretty well for one night. Get the lay of the kingdom, leave the next day, come back time and again using that same royal disguise. And on their side, were the embarrassed royals, who were morons. Instead of being publicly embarrassed by the havoc that was wreaked, they would find some poor peasant to blame it on, put him in stockades, hang him, have him stoned, something like that. Carl, I went.. I think you zigged, when you should've zagged back there, Eddie. Well didn't you... Fuck it. Okay, what? Yeah that's it, take a right up here. So, ultimately, this started out just as a bunch of gossip? Yeah, these guys are like, these assholes that create the bullshit stories for the tabloid magazines. Kind of like that, anyway, fast forward hundreds of years and you got intelligent vampires who are doing the invitation bit. I've saved this one for us, boss. I think it's the best one we've had in a while. Good, all right. Let's see, I'd like to know how much you know about the vampire strains. The media keeps saying there are only two in existence, but what do you guys think? Well, unfortunately, we don't have lab capabilities. We're just in the extermination and clean up services. But that don't mean we don't pay attention. I really do see four different strains in this area. One is splotchy looking, no matter what shape it's in. Another is one that tends to travel on all fours, more animalistic. There's a third one that is mindless, lethargic, zombie like. And then there's one that we like to call the intelligent vampire. And I know that the news loves to argue this one. But I've seen a dozen or so in my time. And I swear, I wouldn't know it if he stood next to me at the supermarket. I wouldn't know until the damn thing come after me. It kind of looks like the house I grew up in with my mom. There she is, there we go. Just park right up here. There we go. Hi, I'm Renee. Hey. Thanks for coming so quickly. The sun was starting to set and I was really worried you guys weren't gonna make it in time. Sorry, it's a bit down the bin for us, from where we've been before. It's a nice place you've got here. Oh yeah, it's a wonderful community. It's really hidden, I have great neighbors. We look out for each other, but nobody's been wanting to take their chances with this guy that's been coming around lately. So, is he filming something? Just documenting for us personally, don't worry, nothing public. Oh, okay then.. This is.. Oh, just call me Renee, Renee's fine. Okay, Renee. Do you mind showing me around the outside of this place real quick? Yeah, sure. Oh, you guys will have to come in through the front door. Some friends of mine and I got a project going out in the garage, just to keep me busy, you know. Trying to keep my mind at ease. Okay, front door's just fine. All right, it's this way. She's either a damn good actress, or something's legitimately scaring her to death. Yeah, she did look really scared. Even before she saw the camera. Man, I'm gonna freak out if we have to hunt a smart vampire. I've never heard a good story of that ending well. You won't. Hey Eddie, get the gear. Yeah, fuck it. So, how do you think my interview went? It's fine. Oh, sorry, I'll stop bothering you about it. I just don't wanna look like a dork, you know? Too late. There, out near that tall cedar tree, that's him. I know it. Lady, if you had a rifle, this would be a done situation all ready. Vampire or not, I would blast him out of my yard all ready. Well I do have a shotgun, but I'm afraid of how hard it kicks. That guy is as stiff as a pole. Look at him, he's not moving at all, what a freak. Evan, can you zoom in on him with that camera? He's not even moving, I can't even tell if he's breathing. His face, can you see his face at all? No, he's just a silhouette really. Well this is disturbing. Hell, maybe he wants to be a scarecrow. Let's go out there and pelt him, and burn him up like one. Nope, I don't like this. It feels like he's baiting us. Renee, you just heard the one guy, right? That's what it sounded like. Just him slowly messing around outside, going to each of my windows and doors, but never really trying to get inside. What you thinking? Doesn't feel right, not at all. Let's just sit tight and wait this guy out a bit. So, how is business going? North Mississippi's pretty good, pretty busy. I can't believe this is happening. Shit there's more out there! Shit, I could've took him out with that shotgun already. It's been two hours now and he's finally moving. Ooh look, there's another one. It looks like a woman. Yeah, we got a duo. I think there's probably more, they just don't wanna be seen yet. Why are they coming here? What did I do to them? Maybe they want a threesome. Ass. How did you really meet this guy? Tell me the truth. I was online, it was a vegan chat room. A what? She's a vegan, she's a purist. You talked about purity of body online, I bet you were the purest vegan on the chat room, weren't you? I was the only vegan in the chat room, so what? It's this bad, I was just trying to promote my yoga and vegan classes that I do here at the house. You're kidding, you do your health classes here, huh? None of this makes any sense. You don't go online and tell everybody about yourself, Renee. You just advertised healthy blood to vampires who know that means a healthier life for them. Did you get that, it's a death wish, do you understand that? I didn't know. Damn, there's more of them out there now. Figures. Well, what if we call those guys from Ridgeland? Fuck them. Why don't you shut the fuck up? Eddie man, they wouldn't even care enough to make an effort. Fuck! No cops, no fireman, and no other team that's gonna come and help us. We're the only ones that deal with vampires, so. You can call the national guard if you want, but shit, they'd have to have a meeting about it just to figure out how many people to send out here. And we'd be dead by then. It was just the one guy. He followed me home after the movie, because you know, we were.. Tell me what really happened at the end of that date. You brought him home, and... So what got you started in this line of work? I wanna know what passion drives you to do this job, you know, just as well as you do. I retired early from the military because my wife had cancer, she passed pretty quick. I just couldn't sit around the house watching the news, seeing how bad things were getting everywhere. Only that outfit in Ridgeland had the closest place around, so I started up AS:VS. I'm glad I did it, I love what I do. I mean, I'm not really the college type. My grades were never really high enough, and military won't accept me because of all of my tattoos. So it was, of course, I was gonna end up in some type of manual labor work. It was either this or the other job. And what's the other job? Crab fishing, in Alaska. That's a good question. Well, I've been a hunter since I was about five and my daddy took me. I killed my first deer when I was about seven. But I didn't bag my first vampire til I was 16 though. Me and this pretty little redhead (Mumbles), took her up park in old bluff in my pickup. This vampire come out, luckily I always got my shotgun in my seat, so I blew that son of bitch's head clean off. And then, after that, I spent a couple years up in Pennsylvania doing a welding job. Once my contract was up, moved back here, and seen that Carl done opened this place up, so I figured this was a good fit. Just kind of bred into it. Rest of everything is just history in the making. I used to post office worker, if you can believe that. I hated every Monday, when the guy would come in with page after page of a new missing persons. It fueled the fire inside of me to wanna make a difference physically. This job coming along allowed me just to do that. Do you realize that with what I've filmed you doing to vampires, it just, you know, helps the stereotype towards postal worker aggression. Oh come on man, that ain't me, is it? You know what, your questions have been prying at me all week, so let's just get it over with. My family was attacked at a rest stop one night. I was the only one who didn't have to go. So I was the only one who stayed in the car. I locked the doors, and I didn't move at all after that. I couldn't move. I couldn't move when vampires tore apart my whole family. I couldn't even move when the police officer showed up hours later, banging on the windows, for me to let them in to help me. Is that good enough for you. I'm so sorry. Shut up. Holy shit, guys, there's three more over there! Look, we're not gonna judge you, okay. You said you brought him home, and... I opened the garage and I pulled in, but he wouldn't get out of his car. I just thought he was being shy. He said we were moving too fast, and that he'd call me. So I walked up and kissed him, and then he left, that was it, I swear. The garage. Hoo, that's strong. I know that smell. Renee, you might be the luckiest purist there is. What is it? What do you mean? You made your cleaning supplies out of lye? Yeah, yeah, I do. This is gonna be an old school solution. Hey, hand me that shotgun. Hey what if we just wait here, barricade ourselves in? We can wait, but I don't think they will. Plus, the rate they're showing up out there, I think we need to hurry. How many out there now? They are everywhere, front and back. This, it better work. It will work, I'd have it loaded and stuff at the shop, weren't so damn expensive and didn't hit my insurance. If you guys get me out of here, I'll get you as much of this stuff as you guys need. Evan, I know you're here specifically to film all this, but I also know you wanna live past tonight. You've managed to stay with us for a while, you keep up really well. We're gonna need another set of hands. Consider yourself deputized boy. Are you serious? All right, batteries, check. New tape, check. Auto, auto everything. I wish I could focus on something like you can. That way I wouldn't be so scared right now. Evan, come on over here. Okay guys, listen up, here's the situation. Unfortunately, our vehicles are parked outside the garage, behind the main car. And since a mad dash out of the garage is a suicide mission, it will attract every one of those bastards. The four of us are gonna clear a path for the other two. To make it to at least one vehicle, and hopefully pick us up on the fly. Okay, so here's how the plan works. Four of us are gonna load up, and we're gonna head tearing ass out in this middle lawn. We're gonna cut and shoot our way past this clump of trees, and then we're gonna angle over toward the driveway, okay? 10 seconds should be enough time to get them on our ass and away from the vehicles, so that the other two can raise the garage door, get in the vehicle, and meet us at the same point on the driveway where we're headed. Now, those of us who are tearing ass out onto the lawn, we're gonna use the shotgun first. Okay, that's you Roy. Shoot the first cluster of them we see when we go out the door. After that, we use the guns. You gotta aim low, don't need to kill them, just need to slow them down, and we need to save ammo. Evan, that's where you come in, you're carrying the ammo. We gotta save every round for holding them off while we pile into the car. Now here's what's important, listen up. If there's even a chance that not one of us is gonna make it to the vehicle, even the slightest chance that an extra split second is not safe, then whoever is driving, just floor it, and don't even think about stopping. I got four straws here, from Renee's broom. The short straw is who's gonna stay back with Renee, and go for the vehicle, got it? Here we go. Shit. Amy, you're gonna have to get Renee out of here, no matter what. You hear me girl, listen. If this doesn't go well, you leave us, you live to fight another day. I just, I can't lose another family this way. You don't ever really lose your family, Amy. They'll always be there for you. It wouldn't be so bad if you weren't making it sound like a goodbye. Hey, carry these with you, you might need them. And be careful. Hey Roy, you about ready with that shotgun? Yeah, just about it. What are you looking for? All right guys, we're going on three. Amy, when you hear three, start your 10 count. Right. Let's stay as clustered as we can, watch your lines of fire, they're gonna be coming at us from everywhere. Evan, you stay between us, get ready with that extra ammo. Right. Roy? Yeah, just one sec. Roy, we gotta go man. What's he doing in there? There. All right, I'm good, let's fuck them up. All right, everybody, take your places! Renee, you're with Amy. Right. Yeah, let's fuckin' do this! Hell yeah, ready for this Roy? Step your game up, step your game up. Let's do this, let's do this! Stay clustered, keep moving! Here we go, on three! One, two, three! Amy just go, just go! I wanted to make a film, this film, you know, I wanted to make a film that made a difference in the world. But what I learned is that real problems are solved by real actions. The best kind of change isn't brought around by just making a film for people to see, it's, you know, brought around by actually getting out there and doing something about it. Amy tried to tell me, but it just didn't sink in right away, I guess. But now I know. Now I understand. You know what, I don't care anymore what kind of grade I get on this project, Professor Scott. I don't even care if I graduate. You know, this isn't exactly the ending that I had in mind for my film, but it really doesn't change my final decision at all. My name is Evan Shandling, and I'm quitting film school. I'm focused on reopening AS:VS. I'm gonna find Amy, and will be hiring some new recruits. ♪ Looking around, I've seen things I'll never be ♪ Looking around, I've seen things I'll never be ♪ Looking around, I've seen things I'll never be ♪ Looking around, I've seen things I'll never be Oh please let this be a cool question. Everyone gives me shit when they're dumb. It'll be all right, just open up the mailbox there and see what we got. All right. Hey AS:VS, would you like to increase your penis size over night? Is this some kind of joke? No, I.. How about end of this crap, man, what's the matter with you? I swear, you just saw me open the thing, and just penis, that's not my fault. This is not funny. Okay, let's make this quick. Um, hey AS:VS, have you guys ever, possibly, seen vampirism effect any animals? I got this one, you just calm down. Now I know people who highly value the (Mumbles), and unfortunately, we have seen some pretty messed up stuff along the way. We've seen critters chewed up, and hanging out of trees, and guts, and we've seen some nasty stuff. I'm sorry, this probably ain't helping none, is it? Nah, dude, you fuckin' reek man, you stink like... Oh, I'm sorry Amy, my nose is all stopped up, I still got doe scent on me from this morning. Dude, just clean your shit up. My place is all covered up in deer, and so I'm gonna bag everyone of them. It doesn't matter, just clean it up. Ugh, you stink. Ugh, to answer your question. No, we don't really see vampirism effect animals. Horses, they get bit a few times and they just die. Dogs and such, they're smaller immune systems can't handle the virus, or they just get drained quicker, they just die. Cows, they're cows, they just get torn apart. Hey Amy, tell them about that time we seen that vampire eating that pigs ... out. Boss man said we should just talk about that email from that college kid. That film kid? Mmm hmm. Okay, whatever, I guess just read his email out loud. Well all right, I think this is it. Okay, let's see, yeah this is the one right here, okay. To Carl or Kevin, AS:VS management, my name is Evan Shandling, and I am a film student in my last year, soon to graduate. It would be my dream to document your company for my thesis film, and final grade this next semester. The holiday break is coming up and I'll have nearly three weeks to get interviews, research documentation, and hopefully even footage of you on the job. I know that my request is out of the left field for you, but I have thought about this for a year all ready. I am very prepared to film how your small business is surviving in today's shaky economy. Huh, I hope that you take me seriously. I am attaching my complete contact information. Much appreciation for your time, Evan A. Shandling. I don't see how this isn't a prank or something. Nah, it's real, we're gonna be movie stars.
