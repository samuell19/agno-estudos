they were willing to sleep in a tent in the jungle to build an action sports resort and that's what they did so yeah it all started in 2008 my brother Travis and I were living at our parents house at the time and one day we bought some beers and we had a meeting in the hot tub about what we wanted to do with the rest of our lives so that night we did a quick google research we looked up cheap land for sale around the world and nicaragua came up we booked two tickets to nicaragua that night and two weeks later we flew down here we are in nicaragua we spent the first two weeks partying meeting people, we had one goal on this trip which was to either look for land or buy some land we met a guy just walking down the street and said he had some property for sale and it had a well and a jungle in the back we said hey look man we only have a thousand dollars, we went to the atm we took out a thousand dollars we gave it to him we signed a little contract then we flew back to Canada. For the next year we got jobs at a gas station we came up with the business plan we wanted to build the first action sports resort in the world but we didn't have any money and we didn't know where to start so, during the one year in Canada that we were working we also posted online looking for investors. I first met Lucas and Travis through a mutual friend that had kind of set us up to talk about some business ventures when we got together i wasn't too sure what to expect, these young guys came through the door they're like 20, 22. they were probably doubling on a bicycle and they had some drawings in their back pocket and they were asking me to invest in them so we went from there and we talked about it and we had some similar ideas and we thought yeah we could probably make this work, once I looked at them and I knew that they had the drive in them that they could do it that's something that you're basically born with so after the one year was up and we found an investor we went down to Nicaragua and we started building. once we got there and we started discussing what was going to happen and what was going to transpire and started collaborating these ideas they just started to flow and and we had the exact same idea of what we wanted to do and same goals to build one of the first action sports resorts in central america. actually in the world. So here we are in nicaragua we bought some five dollar bicycles some machetes and every day we would bike from san juan del sur out to the property which is about three kilometers away and we would just start clearing the land with machetes every day until we realized it's only like five dollars to hire somebody to do it so we started doing that while we worked on the paintball field in the back but we found a crew of workers so we started building our first little house it had a zinc roof big gaps between the walls and the roof. There were bugs everywhere had one fan, yeah it sucked but we were starting from the ground up building our dream one day we bought a baby pit bull we named him buddy we built a mini ramp so we'd skate the mini ramp every single day the mini ramp is only fun for so long so we started building the skateboard park what's up, Bud! This is how we do it at the Surf Ranch! so the first time i went to the Surf Ranch was February 2011 i was on one of Chico Brenes's Nicaragua trips, he likes to take a bunch of pros back to his home state kind of show them what the country's like show them where he grew up and that you can skate there and what a cool country it is and i'd been in touch with Travis and Lucas through a friend of mine in orange county and i don't think Chico knew him but we were going down to san juan del sur anyways and i'd been in touch with them and i was like let's check out these guys are opening this surf ranch skate resort it's gonna have a skatepark I met you know luke and uh travis and i was like yeah we we have you know this is we're gonna build a skate park over here and we're gonna you know make it skateable and everything and the first thing I remember that they had was like this manual pad right here that's behind me and that's what we skated and you know they let us borrow a few surfboards and everything and we hit the beach and when we came back we were skating the manual pad, and that was like the first thing that was built pretty much here you know we pulled up there's actually before we could even get there we had to cross kind of like this little river that a lot of us got out of the um van, van made it across but it was funny to shoot photos of that it's me Chico Kenny Anderson, Luis Tolentino, Danny Montoya, Rob G Mark Stewart was filming John Coltart was another photographer and i remember like us driving through the jungle you know there was nothing there we came across the river and you know we had to drive through the river to get to the other side and i was like oh that's crazy and then that's when we approached lucas and travis's spot. At first sight you know it wasn't much you know it was like a small little house and small manipad and run up so we pulled up and it was literally they had a slab of concrete poured and a manual pad and that was it but you could skate it and it was metal edge too so we got clips of kenny and chico skating it lucas and travis had their house they lived in and there was maybe one bungalow that they had started to build but it wasn't finished yet and other than that it was just a field with kind of like jungle trees beyond it and then and they had it all mapped out they're like these are gonna be bungalows here there's gonna be paintball back there um you know swimming pool, rock climbing wall and it sounded like a rad idea but they had a ton of work ahead of them you know i was like wow these guys are taking a major undertaking but uh you know a great place to do it like right near the beach in near san juan del sur in Nica. Travelling down the river okay river crossing time, with four pallets two by fours this is what we do every day ten times a day okay hold on take a little left turn, this is how we can go this way this is how we get to our house, ok go! at this point we were running out of money so we needed to figure out how to make more money one day i bought this internet stick i was in the little house sitting on a bucket and i had my laptop on this wooden desk and i started playing online poker my brother came in he had two girls with them they wanted me to go party with them and i was like no no i'm gonna play online poker this tournament lasted for about 16 hours and i ended up going to the the beach during that day in the morning and i came back at around six o'clock he was still on his computer and he said he's he was up and i ended up winning like four thousand dollars that was the money we used to buy paintball guns we had them shipped down to the property and we opened up the paintball course a video....video....no video we first met luke and travis in granada when we were at a hostel called the bearded monkey we ended up having a few drinks with them that night and we were out on one of the main streets and one of the guys we were with saw somebody steal a camera right off the table across from us from another tourist and the guys actually ended up running and chasing down this guy caught him and got this girl's camera back so that was kind of our funny story for how we met them we ended up going to san juan a few days later and who was there again we ran into luke and travis and at that time we're staying in a hostel in san juan a few days later all of a sudden we had bought a mattress and we were living in luke and travis's unfinished house on the floor in their kitchen because it was a one bedroom house and luke and travis were living or sleeping in the one bedroom and then we were actually sleeping in the kitchen of their unfinished house we i guess thought that was a great idea at the time all four of us were outside having a barbecue kind of in and out of the house and all of a sudden all four of us went into the house for one reason or the other and i remember turning around and these three guys in bella clavas all walked in to the house and two of them had knives and one of them had a gun and right away luke was in the kitchen and he says we're getting robbed being the only girl there was a kind of a few other thoughts going through my mind at the time and i remember i didn't want to go towards the bedroom because that just kind of meant danger for me so i was almost relieved actually when they kept me with the boys and we all went down like face down in the kitchen head like hands behind our head and they're pointing the gun at us and someone just keeps saying dinero, dinero, dinero, they just didn't believe us so then they just started digging through all of our stuff while the one guy kind of sat over top of us with the gun pointed to all of our heads while we were face down in the kitchen so they took our camera i remember they came over to me and i had a couple silver rings on my fingers and they took took the rings right off my fingers they took everything down to the electric shaver that the boys had in the bathroom and then one by one they put us all into the shower of this bathroom and then so we're all four of us huddled up in the shower and they with the guns still pointed at our heads and they throw a blanket over our heads and we're all kind of sitting there under this blanket nobody's saying anything and um and then they leave and we're like okay like when when can we like when can we get up so i don't remember how long we ended up sitting there for um because they didn't have a car like we believe that they came on foot so we couldn't really hear if if they were still there so we probably sat maybe 10 minutes until we figured out that they were gone and so we're all kind of a little worked up by this point and luke and travis for some reason jump in the car and they go we need to we need to find them so they jump in the truck and they're driving up and down the road trying to find these three people and they never obviously they never did find them so we went to the police the next day and nothing ever really came of it and like that was uh that was the end of our stay in nicaragua i think we packed up our stuff and left it was the next day or the day after that and continued on down south um down to costa rica. The next day we rented a hotel in the capital city and then a day after we flew back to canada because we were too scared so we went back to canada and back to our parents house we had to get jobs again. So this park got flooded all the trees fell down check it out 500 dollar fine, do not pass if we get busted, pay 500 bucks we are passing. after three months of working at the car auction cleaning cars we're like yeah i don't want to do this anymore and we can't let these kids that robbed us ruin our dream so we said you know what let's go back to nicaragua and finish what we started so here we are back in nicaragua and this time we came full force every day we work on the property and we started building the rest of the units the standard rooms the villas we finished up the skateboard park one of the workers grabbed our skateboards and they drew penises on his face, and he skated around the skatepark first try ready, first try ever Ready for this.... If I was a backpacker, I would stay here. why would you stay here? because it's amazing! because you got Marvin doing 360s nice there's the surf ranch for you we also bought this big giant airbag from china. Once we got the airbag we wanted to jump off of it and there was no tower so we put a ladder up to it and i climbed up on the top and jumped off the ladder the ladder kicked out and hit the truck but i managed to jump onto the airbag so it works. We turned our old water tower into a tower that you can jump off of into the airbag my dad was the first one to jump off of it and he did a belly flop first try and after my dad did it everyone else wanted to do it so one day we had this big event we just invited everybody from all the hostels in town and it was crazy so after we had the airbag competition we started focusing on finishing the skatepark just finished the rest of the units we finished the villas the standard rooms the deluxe condos we've finished the pool the restaurant it needs some wax there we go, wax the down ledge as well. Just a little bit. all these people that we knew in town we had them come out and we had a pool party one day we hired everybody that we knew and we opened up if you're planning ahead and looking for some hot destinations we've invited lifestyle bloggers sasha devoetz to the program okay now this was an article that you were just mentioning to me in the commercial break that you wrote about nicaragua and it really picked up uh yeah it just went huge and i think one of the reasons for that is that there's this misrepresentation around nicaragua that it's a dangerous place but actually that is in the past for them now there's a really great resort owned by two canadians from kelowna and it's the Surf Ranch Hotel and Resort, and it has everything from skateboard parks to yoga to hanging out by the pool and accommodations you know one of the reasons that my article went so viral is because so many people have visited there and they wanted other people to know how special that place was right yeah okay cool so we just lost the drone into the jungle we gotta go find it i got to download the map, it's like... i think it's over there in the bushes up top on the other side of the road? yeah alright, lets go find it. okay. time is against us, we gotta find it before someone else finds it that's the last known location. In this field? ya 150 feet in there. we have to get in there somehow? with all the chickens? so we asked the neighbors where it was they said they saw it and then after they said no no we don't know where it is so we're going to jump the fence. So we got close enough to see where we are and it looks like it crashed right inside some bushes and these guys over here looking for it let's go find it when i looked at them i saw two kids that you know they had it together and they had goals and dreams and they were willing to do whatever it took to put it together and that's something that not everybody has in them how many people are willing to go live in a tent in the jungle and focus on a dream for five years that most people are going to tell them that isn't going to happen I first heard of Surf Ranch through a buddy i worked with at an outdoor store back home in tennessee he told me he was like an investor and something down there and that we should go and i was like you know what i got some free time no worries so we went down there for probably close to two weeks or something like that and it was amazing i was i'd never been there before and just being able to go down there and surf in a new spot and just see a different country and um it was special to me it's something that i think about all the time when i first met luke and travis it was awesome i think i met him that day that i got there and we all got to hang and then i think immediately we started planning a little surf mission to Popoyo I found the website through someone's recommendation found the package that was available through the surf ranch my wife and i were both overseas at the time and we were looking for a cool little vacation a cool little uh adventure thing to do instead of just sitting at a regular hotel and drinking pina coladas kind of place by the time it was all said and done we had talked to lucas and travis enough times about the surf ranch and their plans that we just ended up investing in the initial location in san juan del sur buying two of the units. It didn't really feel like we accomplished anything until we had our first big party with a group called free and easy from canada there's about 300 to 400 people and that day i was like okay, like we, we did it we did it Tits out for the boys...tits out for the boys. Tits out for the boys...tits out for the boys. Tits out for the boys...tits out for the boys. Tits out for the boys...tits out for the boys. So, after we opened, the name got pretty big. and we continued our business relationship with Chico Brenes who brought professional skateboarders down originally, so at this point we were flying down pros three times a year and we teamed up with chico to start the first skateboard camp in central america the first time i heard about the Surf Ranch was from a fellow skateboarder of mine named chico brenes he had been talking about the surf ranch for a long time so we went there and and i really had no um no expectations all i knew is that it was you know kind of like a beach town and and uh i was super excited and then when we got there it was just like it blew my mind like what they did with the property and how everything was set up with the skate park and they had a rock climbing wall and a pool and a swim up bar and it was just it was unbelievable it was it was amazing so the first time i heard about the surf ranch was through chico so when uh jose rojo told me that he was going to nicaragua with chico because chico would always go down every i think he probably still does he goes down every year i guess to do these things he just had one um he brings a couple dudes down usually and we go they go skating and go to the surf ranch i told him i was i'm in i wanted to go because i've never been to nicaragua before and you know i'm always down for a new place so uh when i hit cheeks up he was like yeah absolutely so i was in my name is chico brenes i was born here in nicaragua i left uh to the united states in 1985 it was like during the whole revolution and during the war that was happening you know i remember i was living in uh in the capital in Managua with my aunts and everybody and i was going to school over there when everything was going on and they were recruiting like small kids to go fight you know and i was 10 years old at the time but i was a little bit taller so my mom got scared that they were gonna just recruit me and take me so she was like you know let's go to the states so over the years we stayed in touch via email and they would send me updates on how the ranch was coming along and then when it finally opened and uh you know i plugged it for them on transworld because i thought it looked rad and like who wouldn't want to go to nicaragua on vacation to skate and surf but in the photos they would email me i couldn't believe it was the same place it looked amazing and they said you know we're gonna be doing uh these skate camps with chico and his shop Central the first skate camp that we did at the surf ranch was in 2013 you know and they already had the park and everything like set up and everything so we did a demo for the kids we had a contest for the kids you know the first one that we did it was good like a lot of people showed up I was surprised of all the people that came out of like everywhere even from you know neighboring countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador people just came out of the woodworks right it was crazy and i was like whoa man you know maybe this could work we started bringing you know pros and all kinds of people and doing demos for the kids and everything we brought over 30 professionals here to Nicaragua gift from the gods...gift from the gods. Cheers! we skated with the different skate campers that were there, skated the park pretty much every night in the evening when it cooled off honestly the trip that we took to nicaragua it being my first time like it was the best it was probably one of my favorite trips i've ever been on and i've been a pro skateboarder for going on 20 years. Yeah the surf ranch was rad nice dudes i'd definitely go back I can't speak highly enough of Lucas and Travis because what they did with the property and and just how the hospitality and everybody that worked there was just so kind and so just it was just amazing i mean i would recommend this place to anybody, anybody and sure enough man, it looked as good as it did in the emails and photos it was insane it's just they have the pool and the bar and uh the rock wall super nice apartments with air conditioning the skate park is super fun like bungalows with rooftops you can hang out on everyone that worked there was cool good food they'll take you into town they'll take you to the different beaches to surf it's insane it's really impressive. After the skate camp a big group of white water rafters booked out the whole resort and we ended up partying with them one of the people in this group was Melinda Clarke, an actress from Hollywood and our friend from Canada, Tom, he was down here at the time yeah we just got along really well and Melinda actually invited us to her wedding in California so our friend Tom, my brother and I, we said yeah let's go to California we've never been before so let's go check it out we rented a red Camaro and drove down to Dana point we could of took that train all the way back! made the journey to be here with them especially on this most gorgeous day her parents live one mile up the beach in a beautiful home my better self my good angel I am bound to you. after going to california and seeing all these huge resorts and nice houses we kind of got the inspiration to go back and build the biggest resort in nicaragua we talked to our investors at the first resort to see if anybody was interested in helping us buy the land so after we decided to invest in the first place we saw that they were trying to branch out and kind of create a real brand for themselves and that once again just the whole kindred spirit we were just like man that's really cool so now they're they're not just focusing on this one resort, they're trying to have multiple locations and really make it a uh maybe not global but at least a regional brand and we're just like well that's really cool you know and just investing in that whole area gathering more land more resorts all that kind of stuff we we went ahead and we did all of that in hopes that obviously one day it'll be a giant brand and we'll be super successful, I will say one thing about that the it's funny because you know you always have these people who in your life who they they don't have the vision so with that lack of vision they're just like i can't believe you do that it's so it's so crazy and maybe it is a little bit crazy but then you know who's ever gotten anything done by playing it safe you know being risk takers is really what has separated those who are successful from those who just kind of follow the curve and just kind of go with the flow so we kind of think the idea of being movers and shakers is kind of cool and that's why we have done what we've done we decided to invest in the land because i mean first of all who doesn't want to invest in a beautiful country um on a giant 25 acre piece of property overlooking the pacific ocean I mean just just on paper alone it's like a dream come true and the fact that it was it was even more untouched than san juan del sur location there was just so much potential there is so much potential in that area and driving around and seeing seeing what it is now or what it was a few years ago and being able to picture what it can become in the future is extremely exciting so this is the land, just put the down deposit on it it's got a 180 degree view of the ocean and it's sick. I'm standing up on the top area there's the truck down there this is where all the condos are going to go all around here we bought 25 acres out in Popoyo, we made a design online and we started building this house pretty much after that we sold the second house we started building that as well. we're building the first two houses in Popoyo. we're almost halfway check it out, I can't wait until this is done man it's gonna be sick we sold the third house and then we sold the fourth house the year is 2015 and we're building our second resort Surf Ranch Popoyo, check it out! we're heading out to Popoyo, check on the guys they're building the the gypsum on the ceiling and also putting on the roof on house one, we have a couple of guys building uh the third lot there's about five machines out there so we're gonna go check up on those guys and see how everything's going so how do you fly that thing controller uhhh, it's still good, still good oh it's gonna be good footage We're standing on house one, over here is house two and right now we're building house three well this is the master sala. Let's see if these all work. open it up good to go come on there guys i'll show you around come on to the master bedroom here, there you have your master bed Let's check out this come on out let's check out the pool bam! three houses down I'm driving from san juan del sur out to Popoyo. I got some materials in the back some brooms, nails, wire, so i got to drop it off because the guys ran out of materials we've got to make sure everyone has everything they need we had all four houses sold and we were finishing them up we were building them and we were almost done but when everything seems to be going good bad things happen one day we were driving out to Popoyo, and there's a huge fire on the hill making its way down towards the houses so that was kind of the first sign of bad things to come a few days after that we went to Managua and Travis and i were getting lunch at hard rock cafe, we were sitting outside on the patio and then all of a sudden.... the roof caved in! This just collapsed over me and Luke. within a second we jumped it was just reflexes, we made it but it still hit us it cut us up a bit so at that point we were like okay bad things are coming and shortly after that what happened with travis's truck so i bought a brand new truck it was a ford ranger 2017. One day i was driving to managua and the gas throttle was just stuck and i looked behind me in my rear mirror and there was smoke everywhere this guy just happens to pull over suddenly the whole truck is engulfed in smoke! so he's not hot dogging it? this is like the gas has gotten stuck down or something that's correct according to the poster he said that he was driving along when suddenly he says the accelerator stuck that's when he pulled over was able to put it in park set the emergency brake and get out but you can hear the thing revving like crazy and the smoke that you're seeing isn't coming from the tires it's coming from something that's called diesel engine runaway things like this typically don't happen anymore but basically what's gone wrong is some sort of engine fuel mixture and is revving the engine out of control according to some things i read on the internet just turning the car off doesn't stop the engine basically what you have to do is smother the engine co2 fire extinguishers can take away the oxygen from the engine and that can sometimes get the engine to cut out or what i believe to happen in this case is it just burns itself out eventually that revving stops and the smoke clears do you replace the whole engine or do you need a whole new car i think it's a brand new car you take that right back to the dealership and say we've got an issue i didn't know if the truck was going to blow up or not my girlfriend and i were in the truck and so i pulled over to the side i tried to turn the ignition off but it just kept smoking and the smoke started entering the vehicle so we both got out and just she ran forwards and i ran backwards and i ended up filming the whole thing The civil war in 2018 broke out, we already had tickets booked to go to Japan. In order to get to Japan we had a drive to the Managua airport, they would build these roadblocks there were guys on the street writing all over our windows tires were burning everywhere all the roads were blocked so we had to go through the jungles all the way to Managua It was crazy! I got to Managua first. I was in my hotel and just outside the hotel there's this like big flower statues that the government built and everybody was tearing them down there's probably like 200 to 300 people and they were sawing this big statue down so i was in my hotel room i was filming the whole thing by the time i got downstairs people were jumping on it so we went across the road to this little pub it was pretty full people were drinking so we started drinking and i see on the tv behind my brother i see the statue falling repeatedly over and over and then i look closely and there's a guy running the statue fell on him and killed them the next day we flew out to Japan walking the back streets in Japan what did we find here? it was pretty fun in japan we got to explore a new culture and get some ideas for our future hotels so our two-week trip was up and we had to fly back to Nicaragua but at this point the whole country was crazy so we couldn't fly back to nicaragua we had to divert our flight to costa rica and here i am again for the fourth time since the regime's crackdown on the nicaraguan people began on april 18th because i believe that it is vital now more than ever for the united states to support the people of nicaragua in its fight to re-establish democratic order We flew to Costa Rica with just our backpacks on same feeling as when we went to Nicaragua for the first time. we didn't know that we were gonna be stuck in costa rica for the next six months so during that time we had an idea to build an automated hotel so we spent the first few months in tamarindo costa rica trying to find a lease on a hotel that maybe we could renovate and open up we found a good deal on this hotel it was a seven unit apartment building with a restaurant that was attached to it so we bought it and we started renovating. so with both the restaurant and the hotel combined Surf Ranch has become very popular we were full every single day Travis's friend that he met back in Canada he invited him down to do a promotional commercial for the hotel he came down and yeah he filmed the hotel and a bunch of activities that we offer and just their family is just such a um such a they just have such a warm vibe and such a welcoming vibe and we stay i don't remember one night we stayed up with them until i don't remember late but it was just so cool to see that family vibe and it translates into the way that they run their hotel it's just such a welcoming place and then Nicaragua got better and people started traveling back to nicaragua so now that we had the first resort in san juan del sur which we opened up again. we had the surf ranch in Tamarindo, Costa Rica. Now it's time to go back to Nicaragua and finish Surf Ranch Popoyo. well since it was rainy season too a lot of houses were being flooded a lot of people didn't have work, less tourism now so before we opened up we decided to give back to the community, go hand deliver food to all the houses in the area and just help people out once we felt comfortable we opened up the resorts again and we started building in Popoyo, it's time to start on the apartment complex and one of the largest buildings on the coast of Nicaragua. Welcome to the surf ranch I'm at the Popoyo site and we're about to begin construction on the apartments so as you can see behind me there's nothing here whole resort it's nothing so the apartment's going to go right here and then over here the pool yeah it's gonna be cool man looking back at this when everything's done we started the same process as we did with the houses got the machineries there leveled up the whole area built the foundation I am standing on top of the world man, this is going to be the Condos. right now it's just all dirt. Ride em Cowboy! I'm out here in Popoyo, we just finished the the lots for the apartment it's gonna be 180 feet long by 60 feet wide yeah it looks like they did a good job. It's gonna be 18 units yeah it's looking good because right behind me you can see the lot, it's pretty big so we have a lot of work ahead of us so once you enter the reception you come up the stairs and then you enter the apartments which are gonna be right behind me so everything at the resort's gonna have ocean view and uh yeah it's like feels like you're on top of the world should I fly it across here, or go high, then fly it this way? Travis just flew the drone, crashed it. two thousand dollars down the drain gotta find it now GoPro smashed, this doesn't move. It's on its last life. we have four houses done we're just about to start on uh put the walls up on the apartment so as you can see right now you see all the blocks we have they're making progress yeah here check it out we started building the apartment complex same idea as kind of what we did in san juan del sur we would sell the units online to people on Facebook, eBay, Craigslist, one by one we sold them and we used that money to build the apartment complex you know what if it was any bigger i could hang onto here and you could lift me up. It's kind of crazy to see that this used to be... all dirt when we first came and scouted out the property and now we have it up three-story building, all right so we've done one of the units one of the apartment units and today we're just gonna start furnishing it up let's check it out looking back onto it how this all started where it was just an idea in a hot tub of getting out of our comfort zone it's definitely a place i would go back to like every year you know depending on the season you could go when it's surf, surf season skate and surf. You could go when it's winter here so you're just chilling in the warmth i mean i recommend it to anybody that i you know know or ask about nicaragua because i mean i i can't wait to go back there, i'll go back there in a heartbeat yeah it's just some really amazing memories and it's just amazing to see what you know luke and travis have done and it just feels like an amazing surf trip every time you go there so yeah i can't wait to get back down Did you get the video? Ya dude it was awesome. so what do you want to do now? film the next one! alright let's go.
