Compliments ain't gonna get you nowhere, and loud, angry talk ain't gonna get it, either. When you come to a stop, you supposed to signal. Aw. Ain't no sense in you acting all loud and black and savage! Hey, man, I-I'm gonna have to call a cop for you. I can see that, Jack. Call the national guard. You still got to signal when you stop. Aw, man. You got to be crazy. Aw, man. Call the army! Call the Navy! Call--call your mama, baby! Can I get a witness? Anybody want to be a witness? See this fool stopped over there, and didn't even signal? Hey, mama, y'all want to be a witness? Child, can you imagine a cat doing that to a brother? Oh, man.

You've got to know how to handle these college boys, Mrs. Brooks. Oh, dad blast it! There. You can give this to your youngest son. Tell him that my demands are nonnegotiable. Yes, Mr. Brooks. Your appointment book, please, Mrs. Brooks. Tsk. You have some free time around noon. I think you should take a walk. Yes, "walk." There. You have a good schedule today, Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Brooks. It seems the Plessey Company has made a $658 million tender offer to Zanzibar Steel Company. Brilliant move. Oh, uh, Mrs. Brooks... You'll have to wear your blue dress to Gail's wedding. But--but you promised me a new one. I know, Mrs. Brooks, but it's a matter of economics. Gail's wedding is costing me more more than I anticipated. But I haven't had a new dress since you retired from the army. I know, Mrs. Brooks, but the entire economic situation is... Shaky at this time. Yes, Mr. Brooks. [Crying] There, there, Mrs. Brooks. Although Gail knew I had my heart set on her going to college, I'm not mad anymore.

Always talking about "the white power structure this," and "the white power structure that." I'll show him something about black power structure-- uhh! I wish you 2 could try to get along' Mr. Brooks. You know I've tried, Mrs. Brooks, but what can you do when that rebel on the roof is stubborn, pigheaded' and ungrateful? But you can still be proud of yourself, Mrs. Brooks. Why, just look how sensible our oldest son, Booker T. Has turned out to be. And you know how we used to fight all the time. But he's working steady now in that poverty program, trying to get ahead. Unh! Gail! Oh, she'll be mad if I don't wake her up. Gail! [Knocking on door] [Mrs. Brooks] Gail! Gail, wake up, now. It's late! All right, mama! ♪[Music resumes] Turn down that dad-blasted radio. Booker T. Stayed over last night, and he's trying to get some sleep. That's one noisy girl. Well, in 2 days, she'll be Martin's problem. Marvin! His name is Mar-vin, Mr. Brooks! Him and his African wedding. He's almost as crazy as his good friend Gideon, insisting on a mumbo-jumbo wedding. Daddy! For the millionth time, it is not a mumbo-jumbo wedding! Why must you have an African wedding? Your mother and I raised you as a good Christian. Daddy, this is the 20th century. It's our way of saying we're black people. Ha! So that's what it's all about. My dear girl, black people have always been black ever since I can remember, and they didn't have to take on a lot of foreign ways, either. Foreign ways! Gail! Gail! See? See? Every time I try to get a little understanding, some child of mine goes storming off. Gail, come back here. Apologize to your father. All I did was ask her a civil question, Mrs. Brooks. I'm sorry, daddy. I know I shouldn't explode like that. It's just that... Well... I just wish that you and Gideon would stop fighting before my wedding. Ok? Ha, ha, ha. You little rascal, you. Morning. Good morning, sir. Mama? Remember when I was 11 and almost pushed the panic button 'cause I didn't have a boyfriend? Oh, wow. I just knew I'd be an old maid. And now I have Marvin. Mama? Sometimes... Sometimes I'm so happy it's frightening. Oh, Gail. Oh, mama. Gail, you don't know how happy I am for you. You don't know how I've prayed for this day to come. Because when you get married, I can keep a promise I made to myself many years ago. You see, I promised myself-- [telephone ringing] I'll get it. Hello? Oh, Marvin. Relax, everybody. Just relax. And have no fear. The kid is here. You need a bath. Is that any way to talk about your baby boy, your pride and joy, huh, mama? I said "a bath." Come on now, sweet cakes. And right now. Comin' in my kitchen, smilin' like a cheshire cat. Aw, mama. And use some soap this time. Well, you're gettin' about as bad as daddy. ♪[Gideon singing African song] Katheryn and Nia called this morning they're on their way over. Alarm clocks, radios... Telephone. Gideon in there sounding like somethin' crawled up his throat and died. Man, gettin' my own pad was a hip move, a very hip move. Good morning, son. You want some breakfast? Uh, no, mom. Just some coffee. [Gail] Bye, love. See you later. Hey, Booker T. Hey, girl. Don't be calling me by that slave name. You know everybody calls me Sharrief. Sorry about that. I forgot. That was Marvin. Oh, mama, we're gonna be so happy. "Oh, mama, we're gonna be so happy." When are you gonna come out of that Doris day bag, walkin' around in that jive dress? I just wish daddy wasn't so quick to judge people. I mean, I'm sure he'd like Marvin if he got to know him. Girl, you know dad ain't never gonna dig no jailbird. Refusing to fight in the war ain't no crime. At least Marvin stood up for his convictions. You know, sometimes I don't understand you, Booker T. Excuse me. I mean Sharrief. I mean, I'm tired of your criticism. I want to see some of your activism. You're beginning to sound like that creep Gideon. Booker T., Gideon is your baby brother. Aw, mama, Gideon is stone incorrect, confusing people, talking that talk. Now, the real solution to the black man's problem is so simple. Come on, Gail. Now dig this. You know I'm right. Now, Chairman Mao's already given the word. Power comes from the barrel of the gun, and we all know that the white man ain't nothin' but the devil. And everything we do should be geared towards his destruction. Hmm. I got better things to do than be sittin' around, murder-mouthin' people. Hey, you! Gail! Booker T. And you can listen to this, too, if you want to. I was just telling your sister about a promise that I made to myself a long time ago. I promised myself that when Gail got married, I was gonna-- [Gideon] Ooh, whee! Go ahead, sis. Yeah! Ah, Marvin sure is one lucky dude. Ha, heh! Hey, mama? Mama, we should be living in Africa. But Marvin would have to get the family at least 500 cattle. He might even have to throw in about 1,000 head of sheep. He might even have to throw in some live lions, huh, Booker T.? Hey, man, you know my name. Aw, man, I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll remember next time, Booker T. Yeah, well, you better dig yourself, man. Gideon, I wish you 2 wouldn't be at each other so much. A body wouldn't know you were brothers. Booker T. Washington Brooks. Ah hoo hoo hoo. Boy, the old man sure did lay a name on you, didn't he? Man, you'd do better going on a lion hunt with a toothpick than messin' with me this morning. You better practice some of that revolutionary discipline there, hear? I have told you to dig yourself. Now I'm bound to whoop you to settle this! I'm on it, man. Now, now, now. We raised you 2 to love and respect one another. Hey, man. Um, I'd like to talk to you about something. 'Bout what? It's in private. I've been layin' to talk to you about something in private, too. I'll meet you when I come back from helping Gail, hear? That's cool. I'll meet you on the roof? Yeah, ok. There. Now... Well, Gideon, before you came in, I was telling Gail and Booker T. How happy I am that she's getting married, because when-- [doorbell ringing] That must be the troops, mama. Uh... When...

I want you to meet a s-i-s-t-e-r. Katheryn, this is my brother, Sharrief. Uh, nice to meet you. Wanna dance? Yeah. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, yeah? Is that good or bad? Doesn't matter. See, I make up my own mind. Let's break it up. Let's break it up. I gotta meet Marvin and do some shopping, and I'll meet you guys later later at the hall. Hey, wait! Gail, uh, let me walk you to part of the way. Yeah, I'll bet he'll walk her part of the way. [Mrs. Brooks] Gideon, can I talk to you for a minute? Y'all go ahead. I'll be there in a minute. Ok, I'll hold the elevator for you. Yeah, mama? Mr. Brooks left this for you. [Sighing] Ok. Gideon, your father was up at 5:00 this morning writing it, and you could at least read it. Go on. Ok. [Sighing] "Dear son Gideon, "since time is making its noble presence felt upon me, "I shall be brief and not remind you of how I, "as a poor and hungry black youth, "stood for hours in the bread lines "during the depression. "But you know that. "And that is why I can't understand "how you can be on strike against your own father "because he wants you to be a business major. "You know full well that a degree "in anthropology does not prepare one to earn money." Oh, wow, mama. "It is you who is involved "in those political activities at your school "and thereby jeopardizing "your entire college career. "And finally, it is you "who refuses to speak to your loving father. "Therefore, my demands are that you cool it, "that all of these transgressions be "rectified immediately, if not sooner. "I realize how difficult it must be "for you, in fact, for all of my children, "to follow in such large, illustrious footsteps as mine." Whew! "Gideon, you disappoint me. "If you were Jewish, I'd have Shiva "said on you. "However, "I shall be kind, forgiving, "and loving, as soon as you meet my demands. "Your loving father, Mr. Brooks." He's full of stuff. [Mrs. Brooks] Gideon. Well, he is, mama. Talkin' 'bout somebody following in his "illustrious footsteps." You'd think he was runnin' general motors instead of that little old barbershop. Bein' a barber is honest work. Yeah, I know, mama. I wouldn't sound on dad because he's a barber. It's just that I know where he's comin' from. Mama, a college education is not something that you get just so as you can get a better job. No, an education is a tool, mama. It's a tool you use to--to help your people. [Friend] Hey, man, you comin'? Yeah, I'm comin', man! I'm comin'! You see, mama. Mama, dad wants me to play it safe. He wants me to join the system. If I did that, mama, I'd-- I'd be turnin' my back on everything that I believe in. I guess you're right. We always taught you to stand up for what you believe in. Gideon, [friend] Hey, Gideon, come on! It's time to go! I'll--hey, be cool, man! Yeah, mama? Nothin'. Go on. They're waitin' for you. What I have to say can wait for another time. Yeah--yeah, ok, huh? Mmm. I'll see you later. Good-bye, son. Hey, sweetmeat. How'd you like to buy some sirloin steaks today? No, come back tomorrow, man. Tomorrow? Oh, man, you must be out of your damn mind. Good morning, Mr. Brooks. Morning, Preston. Hey, schoolboy. I got your schoolboy, sweetmeat. When's that class finished, Preston? 2 more months. Then you'll be gone, huh? Like a Turkey through the corn. My man, Preston. Hard into himself some real estate. Ow! That's right. People without land's in serious trouble. Whole thing's about land. You look like a sheep. John Henry, don't start this stuff today. Now, you know how I feel about that in my shop. I'm not a customer. And besides... He goes to college. [Laughing] Hi, Mrs. Brooks! Hi, Breck, Gillette, Jean-Nate, Ajax. Hello, there, wild root. Y'all kids move over and let Mrs. Brooks pass. Ok, let me see. What-- ok, there you go. Now git! Y'all be careful on them swings! I don't want nobody comin' in here cryin' this mornin'. Oh, don't use that one, Gladys. It's broke. Oh, thanks, Ruby. That'd be all I'd need this mornin'. What's the matter, Gladys? If ya catch a sucker, bump his head. That's what they say? The trouble is they talkin' about me. Oh, girl. Oh, it's true, Ruby, and you know it. I just let everybody push me around! Oh, come on, Gladys. What's Mr. Brooks done now? Oh, the way that man courted me before we got married. Sugar-sweet names he called me. And the day after we got married, he started callin' me Mrs. Brooks! And now he's got me keepin' that ol' appointment book, so he'll know what I'm doin' every minute of the day. One of these days, I'm gonna throw that appointment book out the window! That's what I'm gonna do! The only thing I don't have to put in it is when I cough or go to the bathroom. Ah, child. And don't let me even look like I'm gonna disagree with him. Then he rants and raves up a storm, act like he's gonna thunder and lightnin' for 40 days and 40 nights! If there ever was a man who knows how to get mad, it's Mr. Brooks. Last week, I overspent on buyin' groceries. Talk about a man carryin' on! You would have thought that 17 cents was gonna cause a panic down on wall street! I'm on your side, girl. But I will say this for Mr. Brooks: He does have good intentions. My granny always said, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." My granny always used to say there's some good in everybody. Well, if there is some good in Mr. Brooks, he done done a Houdini with it and made it disappear, 'cause you sure can't see it. All in all, child... I don't know. And don't let me even think about askin' him to take me somewhere. Then he tells me about his mother, what a good woman she was, and how easy we modern women have it... And how she worked from sunup to sundown. To hear him talk about that woman, you'd think she was Joan of arc, virgin Mary, and Aretha Franklin all rolled into one! Aw, Gladys, don't be so hard on yourself. No, no, no, Ruby, I made up my mind this mornin'. I'm keepin' a longtime promise. I am leavin' Mr. Brooks! Girl, you know it ain't all that easy-- tellin' me that I can't buy a new dress for my own daughter's weddin'! Well, if there's such a thing as a last straw, that was it! Now, Gladys, we all know Mr. Brooks has his problems, but that don't mean you gotta leave him. After all, there is such a thing as jumpin' from the refrigerator into the fryin' pan. Oh, now, Ruby, be serious. I am! Just as serious as cancer! At least he is dependable. Hmm. He ain't never been known to mess up with a piece of money. Well, a lot of good that does me! Everything in the house is in his name! My name don't appear on nothin' except the income tax deduction form. But you still gotta admit-- no, Ruby, I made up my mind this mornin'. I'm leavin'! [Sweetmeat] Deep in the heart of the kingdom sticks, the animals had a poolroom, but the baboon was slick. Till up jumped the monkey from coconut grove. He said, "let me get some of this money "'fore this place close." Baboon said, "man, "you wanna shoot some pool?" Monkey said, "I can't shoot no pool, "but if you'll pull up a stump "to fit your rump, "I'll play you some cooncan "till your rear end jump." [All laughing] Hey, John Henry. Gideon still up on the roof? I've asked you not to mention that name to me. Boy, that Gideon is sure one outta sight youngster. You're entitled to your opinion. And everyone is, I suppose. We'll just wait and see. Eh, sweetmeat? Hmm? I fixed his wagon this mornin'. Really laid it on him, huh, John Henry? Thanks, homer. Put my foot down. Still on strike, ain't he? He'll be a man soon. And then there'll just be me and Mrs. Brooks. Still don't know how come you're so lucky to get a good woman like Mrs. Brooks. What do you mean, luck? Mrs. Brooks is no accident! Why, I created her with these very hands. Oh, talk that talk, John Henry. Trouble with you, Preston, is that you don't understand women. Controlling women is an art. You have to have a certain knack. [Laughing] [Preston] Man, you're really on a trip. One of these days, Mrs. Brooks is gonna wake up and turn you completely around. Preston, the possibility of Mrs. Brooks being able to, as you say, turn me completely around is about as likely as your going skiing in purgatory. [All laughing] Don't be so mean, John Henry. This is the time, brothers! Can I help you, brother? Yes! I'd like to speak to the barber who's in charge here. You're looking at him. Do you, uh, own this place, brother? Lock, stock and barrel. Eh, right on! Uh...I'd like to put this in your window. It's for the legal defense of brother Ali gamma. This is the time, brothers! This is the time! The honky dog is gonna have to pay. See, we must begin to unite on the basis of our color, 'cause the pig power structure is daily becoming more fascist. I'll see what we can do. Right on. Now all power to the people, blood to the horse's brow, and woe to those that cannot swim, Jim! Filthy-mouth rascal! Calling people animals. Aw, John Henry, where you coming from? The brother was right. We gotta stick together. Don't deal with how he said it. Deal with what the man said. They're crazy. Going around talking about, "say it loud! "I'm black, and I'm proud!" I'll start listening when they change their tune. Yeah. ♪ Say it soft ♪ ♪ I'm black and I'm boss ♪ ♪ say it soft ♪ ♪ I'm black and I'm boss ♪ Ow! How you doing? What's happening? Wow.

[All laughing] You still should've given the brother a play, John Henry. And you're supposed to be a man of principles, too. I am a man of principles, but sometimes you have to forget about principles and do what's right. [All laughing] And as the rooster crowed, those who stood before the bar said, "open the door, "for we have so little time to stay, "and once we're gone, "we're not coming back this way." [All laughing] Mr. John Henry Brooks. 3-3-3. Gentlemen, gentlemen, don't waste your time in the vain pursuit of this and that endeavor. Groove with the grape, for it is wiser to fly with the fruitful grape than it is to be high on hopes and illusions. Mr. Sweetmeat. 5-0-5, and make that a 3-way combination please, sir. Mr. Porter fat. Ace, deuce, Trey. Make the most of the time that you have before you, too, are turned to dust. Dust to dust, dust to dust, and under dust to lie, forever. Preston, oh, Preston. When I was young I did eagerly visit philosophers and saints and heard great arguments about this and that. But every time, I came out the same door I went in. [Customer] Give me 4-5-6, and I'll get my kicks. [All laughing] We are nothing but a wandering row of shadows that come and go around the Halloween lantern held in the night by the masters of the show. Sir, 4-5-6, right? Right on, baby. Mr. Porter fat, Ace, deuce, Trey. On time she came. Mr. John Henry Brooks, 3-3-3, right? Right. Sweetmeat, 5-0-5, and make that a 3-way combination please, sir. Aw, shucks! Right on! And lately through the open door, came shining through the dusk an angel bearing a huge vessel on her shoulder, and she offered me a taste from it, and I took it, too. Yes, I did. And it was the grape. [All laughing] Whooee! How a man can remember all those numbers without writing them down is a real deep, dark mystery to me. [Mr. Brooks] It's simple enough, sweetmeat. Rolls Royce has what they call a photogenic memory. Mmhhh! A mind like that, and he's only a numbers runner. You know, rolls ought to be down there somewhere on wall street. [Sweetmeat] What's wrong with you guys? You know as well as I do that rolls Royce has worked down on wall street for years... As an elevator operator. [All laughing] I know it's not gonna be easy to leave, but... I--I just can't take it anymore. Everybody treats me like I'm an old couch. Oh, Gladys. Oh, lord, I don't want anybody to catch me crying. Well, well, just in time. Oh, stormy Monday, how you doing? I'm doing it to death. Well, look who's here. How are you, Ruby? Fine. And how is Breck and Gillette and, um, Jean-Nate and wild root and Ajax? Fine, just fine. All the children is just fine. I just came from your door. Do you have any baking powder? Sure. Come on. Hey, Ruby, I finished making your dress, but the way you're gaining weight, I don't know if it still fits. Heh! Say, have you ever heard of the weight watchers? You ever heard of S.I.J.? No. What's S.I.J.? "Sock in the jaw." It's good for people with diarrhea of the mouth. Mess with me this morning, I'll let you try it. Oh, really? Hey, Gladys, did you hear? The welfare people was by Ruby's house last night and almost caught Wilbur. Now, talk about a man with heart. Hanging from the window 15 stories up. Ruby, you should have poured lye on his hands. Oh, stormy, be nice. You shouldn't be so hard on men. Yeah. Shoot, now after what you 2 been through, I don't see how you can even fix your mouth to say one good word about any man? Now, stormy, just because you've been burned a few times, you act like you've got a patent on being evil. Gladys you're always saying that, and you know it's not true. Yes, it is. Well, the fact is, Gladys, you the one who's always complaining and crying and talking about you gonna leave Mr. Brooks, and you know you ain't going nowhere. Yes, I am, too. I made up my mind this morning. I'm leaving. Ruby, you think Gladys is going anywhere? My name is Hess. I ain't in this mess. The only reason I stayed this long was because of the children, but it's different now. Gail is getting married and the boys are old enough to take care of themselves. When that preacher say, "I now pronounce you man and wife," I'm starting me a new life. Well, I'll say. Sit down. I'll bet you don't have any money saved, right, Ruby? I told you I wasn't in this mess. I do too have money. I just haven't had a chance to save much. I got $27.31. Ohh! $27.31? Where you planning on going? To the zoo? Ha ha ha! Oh, come on, Gladys... Oh, stormy. Come on, I'm not trying to hurt you. I am just trying to make a point. All right, now after you get the money end straightened out, what is the next thing you do? Oh, I don't know. How about you, Ruby? I don't know. That ought to be easy for you. Wilbur is always threatening to do it. Pack his bags? That's what I'm talking about. Have you got your clothes together yet? Well, I was gonna take my walk first. What kind of a walk? Well, truthfully, I don't think you are ready to leave Mr. Brooks. You know, stormy Monday, I had you wrong for years, girl. You do have some sense after all. Yeah, it was a lousy idea for you to leave Mr. Brooks, but you should do something. Let me think a minute. Hey, I'm dry as a potato chip. Ahem. Do you have anything to drink? Down in the cabinet, stormy. Speaking of potato chips, you got something else to nibble on, Gladys? Ruby, there's cookies up in the cookie jar. Stormy, stormy, what did you say I ought to do? This ought to do it. Oh, how about you 2 young ladies? You gonna join me, Ruby, Gladys? I do not mind if I do have a little taste just for medicinal purposes. Now, that's my girl. You 2 go right ahead. You know Mr. Brooks don't like-- see? You see? Do you see what I am talking about? Yeah, all right, but not too much. Not so much, stormy! Okay? Ahem! Cheers! Cheers. Now, what did you say I ought to do, stormy? Yeah, stormy, quit stalling. Run down your commercial. All right, well, the thing is Gladys has got to change herself. Change herself? Change myself? That's right. Wait, wait, Gladys, sit. Let me run it down to you. Good god! Mmm-mmm! I sure hope I hit today. I got to do me some mean chippie chasing, and for me to do that, I need some very heavy Greens in my pocket. [Porter fat] Hey, sweetmeat. Yeah? You sure talk bad for a married man. Hey, man, my wife's the one that's married, not me. Hey, there's my man! My main man. What's happening, fun loving? What you want to happen, baby? You got it. Oh, yeah? Well, there's green lights all the way, baby. Nothing but green lights all the way. Say, John Henry, you about ready for me? Sure thing, fun loving. Right this way. That's my man. Okay, let's get it on. I got a lot of business to take care of today all up and down these mean streets. Not that it worries me none, though, heh! 'Cause I ain't givin' up nothing. I wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch if I owned a lumberyard. [Sweetmeat] Fun loving, don't be so mean. Hey, sweetmeat, your post. Man your post! Hey, lady, you can't come in here. No ladies allowed. The kingdom of god is not a matter of talk, but of power. [Mr. Brooks] Don't let her in! Choose, then! Am I to come to you with a rod in my hand, or in a sweet and gentle spirit? Shoot your best shot, lady. [Laughing] "Oh, be proud of yourselves, "for his heart, "though he is absent in body, "he is present in spirit, "and his judgment upon the sinner "is already given." Yes, Jesus, yes! Hallelujah! Given as if he were indeed present. Hold on there, sweetmeat. Come on, sweetmeat! Come on, baby! [Mr. Brooks] Hold on to her! Sorry, lady, we love the good lord, too, but you're gonna have to work your show from the outside. I ain't never let a lady past me, not one, not one, lord, and there ain't no sense in a boy breaking a good record like that, nooo, lord! Hey, preach, sweetmeat! Preach, baby! Ha ha! "The man who sins "is to be consigned to Satan "for the destruction of his body "so that his spirit may be saved "on the day of the good lord "in the name of the lord Jesus Jehovah!" [Mr. Brooks] Come on, sister, save us! Amen! [All laughing] [Mr. Brooks] Stop right there, sir. Stop dead in your tracks. Don't you take another step further. The treatment. Oh, John Henry. [Stifled laughter] Come on, get with it, baby! Clean it up. Boy, them little old ladies sure tickle me. They ought to be in the suburbs spreading the word. It's whitey who needs to be reminded that the Bible says, "you got to reap what you sow." Yeah. Hey, Preston. "And in his judgment "upon the sinner "is already given." You better watch it, sweetmeat. I heard that god was a black woman. Mmn-mmn-mmn! And you know what that means. We all gonna have to pay some mighty heavy dues. With god a black woman, we'd be in troubllllle! Oh, why don't you cats wise up? Anybody can talk about what's wrong with black women. I want to hear somebody talk about what's right with them. Black women are evvvvvil! [All laughing] [Stormy] Now just a little bit on the top here. Oh, not too much off the top. She could look like a man. I don't want to look like no man, stormy. Are y'all so backward? I mean, really, do I look like a man? Why don't you touch it up a bit more over there? Who is doing this chick, huh? Move! Ruby! Hold your head up. I think we almost got it. Well... I think that's it. Okay. Look. Give me your drink. Is this me? You do look sort of different. Whoop! Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey, I see you're still in the CP time, sport. What you talking about, man? I'm right on time. Shoot. Yeah. So, what you been up to, huh? Well, I'm just there, you know, but being careful. Yeah, I dig. Just skippin' on by. Man, it's been a long time since I've been up here. Remember I used to have that pigeon Coop right over there? Yeah. All the hours I used to spend up here. You wouldn't even allow me up here, dude. Heh heh! Man, it sure seems like a long time ago. It's funny how time just dances by. Heh heh heh! Hey, hey, remember that chick across the street, huh? That big-legged chick you brought up here that time? What was her name? What you talking about? Come on now, man. You remember, now what was her name? Remember you got upset because during the whole Johnson, she couldn't stop popping her gum. Oh! You remember? What's her name? Aw, man! Gloria! Right. That's her name! Gloria. Gloria... Cook, cook! Yeah, yeah! See, you remember, man. Yeah, I remember, man. I thought you wanted to talk to me about something, anyway. Yeah, well, uh, it's about dad. Tsk! That all you want to talk about? Hey, wait, wait. Now, I talked to him a long time last night. He's really getting upset. Man, that dude is always upset about something. You could listen to what I have to say. All right, go ahead. Go ahead. You know how the old man likes to keep his business to himself. Well, neighbors are talking, and it's getting to him. That's what this whole thing is about, big brother. Hey, dad's really a nice guy when you get to know him. You want to know what's really happening with him? He's lonely. Now, I didn't understand that before, but when you move out on your own, you begin to see things. Yeah, I hear you humming, but I ain't coming. Look, Gideon, all I'm asking you to do is to just meet the old man halfway, that's all. Man, now, dad is living in the 1930s. And you asking me to meet him halfway? Ain't this some incredible stuff? Now, instead of giving out advice like that, you ought to get your own house in order. Now, what do you mean by that? I've done said what I had to say. People who live in glass houses just ought to be cool, that's all. If you've got something to say, why don't you just come out and say it? All right, I will. Tell me, man, you got anything against sisters? Heh heh heh! Oh, wow. I haven't got anything against sisters. Why? How come I ain't never seen you uptown with no chicks, then? Yeah, so? So? So there's a whole lot of boss sisters out there, man. Can't you find one? Hey, Gideon, look, I don't know what you're talking about. You want to know what I think? I think you're afraid of sisters because you can't deal with them. Yeah, that's right. You the kind of dude who winds up marrying white. You probably got some gray chick on the side right now. What you think about that? I just think you're one crazy nigger, that's what I think. You run into some dynamite smoke or something? 'Cause if you did, give me some so I can be crazy like you. Well, do you? Do I what? Do you have a white girlfriend? Look, I don't know what you're talking about. Booker, why don't you stop playing games, man? You were seen going down to Terry's with a blonde. You were seen at the boondocks with a blonde. So I go out with a white girl every now and then. What are you getting so excited about? It's not your business. It's highly personal. I happen to dig a certain quality in a chick, and I haven't met a sister that I can groove with, that's all. Man... Heh heh heh! Oh, hey... Hey, Booker, sisters are some very beautiful people, man. We can't afford to be getting into no negative things with them. How can we build a nation of strong families without them? Mm-hmm, tell me anything. Spit on my back. Tell me it's raining! Next thing I know, you'd be telling me you came up here just to build a strong family. Well, yeah! Yeah, otherwise, I'd have moved out like you did. Man, who I sleep with is my own personal business. Oh, no, man, no! Who you sleep with, the first face you see in the morning, is very significant, man. That's where you get your energy from. It's your mirror, Booker. Can you dig it? You ought to be getting your black thing together instead of going around sleeping with the enemy, huh? People are people! That white chick ain't nobody's enemy. She's an individual, an individual, and a beautiful one at that, but that's not the point. The thing is, it's me. Me! And if you don't understand that, then shame on your black hide. No, man, you've got to get out of that "me, me" thing. Why don't you wake up? It ain't about yourself, man. What are you getting so excited about a girl that you don't even know? I don't want to see my brother running around being a hypocrite. Now, I mean if you're into a white thing, then-- then stop talking black. You confusing people, Booker, sneaking around. Be a man! Oh, later for you, 'cause I ain't got time to be standing around listening to a whole bunch of nonsense. Well, how about it, super spade? You gonna take the white girl to the wedding? I'm sure mama and daddy'll be highly impressed, huh? All right, Einstein! All right! I know what you need. I haven't given you a dusting off in a long time. Booker, I don't want to get into no physical thing with you. I'm just asking you to be a black man, that's all. Stop trifling, that's all. No, man, I know exactly what you mean! Come on, get up, chump! I'm gonna rock your sky! Hey, man, put down that warrior, huh? You can rock all the skies you want, I just want my cut, that's all. Turkey! Talking about being a man, huh? Where's your heart? In my head where it's supposed to be. All right, chump. Henhouse! You put down that spear. You afraid of a fair one? What's the matter? Can't you do anything besides talk, hypocrite? What's the matter, John Wayne? You put down that spear, and I'll teach you a lesson. I'm already teaching you one, man. It ain't about a whole lot of talk. It's about action, can you dig it? Action! Oh, later for you. I ain't got time to be bothered. What's the matter, man? Where's your heart at? You put down that spear, and I'll show you. Talk's cheap, chump. Yeah? You gonna put down that spear? Can a buffalo skate? Later for you. [Ruby] It do look different. Sort of like... Sort of African. Yeah, Gladys, that's exactly what you look like. You like one of them African queens. Ohh! An African queen! Ruby, go upstairs and see if Gideon's up on the roof for me, please? We don't have much time, and he can be our consultant. Ok, now, let me see if I can get these on you. Ohh! Now, if you're going to be an African queen, you've got to carry yourself like one. Ok. Now walk. Hold your chin up, Gladys. Right. D-don't slump your shoulders. That's it. Now walk proud, proud and beautiful. Ohh! Oh, yeah! That's it. Ok, let's go. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. I got just one last thing to do. [Shouting and laughing] That's boss, my man. Real boss. Hey, let me dust you off there. Then you'll be cleaner than the board of health. Why not? I'm as free as the breeze, and I do as I please. Besides, don't take nothin' but a little money. Here you go, brother. Fun loving? You're a scholar and a gentleman. Thank you. Say, sweetmeat? Mm-hmm? Well, now, I don't mean to be dippin' into y'all's business, but I've been listening to you dudes talk about womens, and I want to run down a little somethin' to ya. Now, all you need to get a woman is a strong rep. Hey, what'd I say? Every woman in the streets wants a piece of me. They call me sweet... Ahhh Peter Jeter, the womb beater, the baby maker, and the cradle shaker, the deer slayer, the buck binder, and the womens finder. I am known from the gold coast to the rocky shores of Maine. Fun loving is my name, unh, and love is my game. He said, "love is my game." I'm the bed Tucker, the milk shaker, the record breaker, and the population maker, the humdinger, the gunslinger, and the baby bringer. I am fun loving, fun loving the hard hitter, and the poly-nuci gitter. The fudge, the sludge, the women's pet, the men's fret, and the family's pinup boy. Fun loving, the trickster. I said, fun loving, the Berry picker. The city slicker, and the candy licker. I ain't giving up nothing but bubblegum and hard times, and I'm fresh out of bubblegum. I'm the man who walked the water and tied the whale's tail in a knot. I taught the fish how to swim, crossed the burning sand, and shook the devil's hand. I rolled around the world on a snail carryin' a sack that said "air mail." I walked 49 miles of barbed wire, and I use a cobra snake for a necktie. Yes, I am hemp the demp, the women's champ. Women fight for my delight. I am a baaad dude. Johnny ripsaw, the devil's son-in-law. I gave a highway patrolman a speeding ticket and sold a blind man a flashlight. I am the only man in the world that knows why white milk make yellow butter. I even know where the lights go when you cut the switch off.

In the name of peace, self-determination, and liberation, I demand that you sign my list of demands. List of demands. List of demands? [Stormy and Ruby] List of demands! And they are nonnegotiable! [All laughing] Just shut up! ♪[Trumpet plays] Mama? I don't want to sound selfish or anything, but why'd you choose a time like this to stand up to dad? Oh, baby, I don't know. It's more like the time chose me. All right. Ok, troop. Now get ready for phase 2. How'd it go, son? Just like clockwork, mama. Hasaan and the boys came through like thoroughbreds. Yeah. Perfect execution. Man, that was something else. What's the matter with you, sis? A family squabble in the middle of your wedding. Oh, Gideon, what's gonna happen? It's like you're trying to organize a war. Gail, go downstairs. Tell your father to sign that list and tell him it's his last chance. Oh, wow. Come on, now. It's gonna be all right, sis. I just hope everybody remembers there's supposed to be a wedding tomorrow, that's all. Gail's so worried about her wedding, I feel like calling off the whole thing. Mama-- I remember my wedding, and I know exactly how she feels. Well, just relax, huh? Just relax, mama. Everything is gonna work out fine. Hear? Just fine. Now, uh, let me call on stormy Monday, see how she's doing. H-1? H-1, this is h-5. Do you read me? Dad blast it, I'm gonna be late. Booker T.? Which one of these do you like best? Uh, yeah. Well, uh, let's see. Woman leaving me at a time like this. She could have at least put out my clothes before she left. I'm telling you, son, there's a whole lot of inconsideration in this world. I think I like this one. Ah. Gail, what did your mother say? She's not coming back until you sign the list. What? Has she lost her mind? What's wrong with that woman? Hey, dad, you haven't even read mama's demands yet. Let me get ready. I'm already late. But, dad, you could at least read it. Never! What is going on up there? Everything. Charts, binoculars, walkie-talkies. I just hope everybody remembers there's a wedding tomorrow. [People chanting] Hey, what's... What's going on out there, huh? [Chanting] ...Off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain... [Telephone ringing] Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Wow. Hello? Oh, Marvin. Oh, no, I'm not excited. One of mama's friends is just picketing the front door, that's all. [Booker T.] Oh, that's sweetmeat! What? Oh, hold on. Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! Take the chain off your brain, John Henry! [Cheering] What's all the racket out there? [Mr. Brooks] Why, the nerve! [Doorbell ringing] What are they doing to me? Matter of life and death. John Henry? John Henry? You gotta do something. They've taken over our barbershop. What? Barbershop? [Gail] Who? Hasaan and a bunch of other kids with a lot of hair on their heads. Well, come on, sweetmeat. There's a couple of baseball bats in the closet. We're gonna clear up that barbershop. Dad, wait! Wait a minute. Now, use your head, please. Now, can you imagine the headlines? "Barber arrested wielding a baseball bat." You'd be the laughingstock of the whole town. The boy is right, John Henry. [Booker T.] We gotta make a plan. We gotta start negotiating. Right, right. I absolutely refuse to make any bargains under pressure. Oh, John Henry. Dad, it's only a front. We'll tell mama we're willing to discuss her demands, but only on the condition that she call off the picketing. And open up the barbershop. I see. And while we're talking, business continues as usual. [Giggles] Brilliant! But that's not fair! Gail, you want your wedding to come off tomorrow, don't you? Read the demands to dad while I go upstairs. Hey, son? If you can't talk some sense into Gideon, see if you can't pull your mother off to the side. Maybe we can split them. [Laughs] [Laughing] Yes! Ok, daddy. [Gail] "I, John Henry Brooks Jr., "do hereby agree "that things must change, "and that henceforth, "a new relationship will now exist "between me and my wife, "Gladys Anne Brooks. "Therefore, "I agree to the following: "I will no longer slurp my coffee. "I will remember to put the top on the toothpaste. "I will not pass gas in the bedroom. "I will no longer require my wife "to keep an appointment book." What?! "I will no longer require my wife "to save the trays from TV dinners." The trays from-- "from now on, I will give my wife a weekly allowance. "I will call her Gladys, and not Mrs. Brooks. "I will allow her to work "as a manicurist in my barbershop." Over my dead body! "I will no longer--', enough! I said that's enough! I absolutely refuse to listen to any more. Now, John Henry-- but daddy, I'm not even half through! Gail, I said that's enough! What's the phone doing off the hook? Oh, my god! Marvin! Oh, no. He hung up! I give up! I'm going to my room! Good! Hyah! Cha cha! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! All right. All right. Gideon, will you please report on what's happened so we can get phase 3 started? Okay. Phase 1: Took over the barbershop. Right. Check. Phase 2: Set up pickets all around the building. Check. Phase 3 is where you come in, stormy Monday. Gotcha. Hyah! We're ready! And if he still doesn't sign, then we go into phase 4 and phase 5. Sometimes I wish we didn't have to do it like this, mama. Me, too. But you know, they say a hard head makes a soft behind. The way your father's carrying on, you'd think I was asking him to jump off the London bridge. All I want him to do is to relax and let me love him. Ahem. Good morning, everybody. Sure is a pretty day, ain't it? Hmm. Look who's sliding in. Well, how is everybody? Look, man. If it ain't about dad signing that list of demands, we don't want to hear it. Mama, dad's been going through a lot of changes lately, been doing a lot of deep thinking, and, uh, he's ready to start discussing discussing your demands. I'll bet. Hey, man. I'm trying to talk to mama. See, mama, it's like this. Uh, after all, we can't forget about Gail downstairs with a wedding on her mind. What's wrong with Gail? Is she all right? Mama, now don't you listen to this dude. My man, is dad ready to sign that list? Well, see, the thing is-- is he ready to sign the list or not, man? You see, it's like this-- can you believe that, mama? Huh? Until dad's ready to sign that list of demands, we've got nothin' to discuss. Come on, mama. We got our staff meeting to get to. Relax, sweetmeat. Relax. You keep saying that. But I'm wondering about our customers. Relax, sweetmeat, and cool it. Booker T. Is negotiating my interest. [Doorbell ringing] That's probably him now. What's going on? Gail all right? Of course she's all right. We're having a little misunderstanding, that's all. Oh, Marvin, am I ever glad to see you! Ugh. Oh, I wanted to call you back. You're not mad, are you? I'm not mad, baby. I was just worried. What's going on, anyway? Why the pickets? I can’t understand you, Booker T. Instead of you trying to convince me to give in to your father, you should be trying to encourage me to stand up to him. But mama, the 2 of you been together all these years. Only because I kept my mouth shut all these years. Oh, mama, I know the old man could be a little rough at times, but I thought you loved him. I do. I love your father. In fact, we all love your father. But nobody can live with him. And all the time, I thought that the 2 of you were really a beautiful couple. You got a lot to learn about women, son. Never make a woman do anything to make her lose respect for herself. Look, man. I think you better go on back downstairs. Yeah, the pickets and takeover are just light action. If dad don't come through, we gonna sock it to him. Right on! You tell him he got 5 minutes to sign that list, or we're comin' out smokin'. Hey, man, I'm trying to talk to mama. Why don't you lighten up? You ain't talkin' to no white girl! Man, you better watch yourself, or I'll-- or what? All right, just keep on, man. Keep on pushing me. What? Just keep right on. You keep on! [All yelling] Hey, hey, man. Hey, calm down. Oh, Marvin, I'm so glad you're here. Gideon, what has come over you? Look, man, it was bad enough when you were up here by yourself, but now you got your mother involved, too. No good. I've been trying to tell him-- wait. You're no better, supporting your father trying to jive your mother. Hey, now wait a minute, man-- don't deny it, Sharrief. Gail heard you and Mr. Brooks. You're just stalling for time. You see that? I told you you was wrong-- hey, hey! I say you're both wrong. Fightin' in the streets, tellin' lies. Always quoting Chairman Mao. But you should remember what Malcolm said. You do not solve a family squabble in public. Gideon, look, man. You can use those calculating tactics against outsiders, but with your family, you use another value system, one based on love and respect. Sharrief, I expected more from you. You're supposed to be a new black man, and you're coming up shaky. But I was doing it for the family, for father, for-- I don't see how you can preach black liberation and still refuse to support your own mother in her struggle for self-respect. Now, come on, man. We gotta stop this bickering. The only valid "ism" is "we-ism." We cannot allow differences to separate the family. Sharrief, man, your mother is fighting for her dignity. You should support that. And Gideon, bro, you just got to find a way to deal with your father. Right on, Marvin. Let's put our heads together and see if we can find a way to liberate Mr. Brooks. Hi, dad. Booker, what took you so dad-blasted long? How's it look? Uh, dad, uh... You've been had. Had? Boy, what the devil are you talking about? You talk to him, sweetmeat. He's crazy. Hey, dad, you better sign while you're still ahead. Booker T., what's come over you? Sit down, dad. Humph. If the picketing and the takeover don't work, they're planning on picketing the bank where you keep your account. Oh, my god! Wow! Dad, mama's got her communication thing together, too. She's printing up some leaflets, sort of, um, position papers, and having the kids pass them out in the community. Position papers? Right. And dig this, dad. She's also setting up a press conference. She's already talked to the newspapermen, and now she's working on a contact with CBS. [Both] CBS! Mm-hmm. Why, I'll crush her with my very hands. Dad, uh... Just in case there's any rough stuff, mom has got a group of women karate experts waiting. Stormy Monday's a commanding officer. Man, you better get you a lawyer. Mom has already talked to 3 lawyers, and the one lawyer on your side told mama that the least she can get in a settlement is the apartment and all the money. [Both] All the money? Right! Why, she's even considering asking for a congressional investigation. Son, what are we going to do? Uh, what do you mean "we," baby? Booker T., where are you going? I'm going upstairs and talk to a lady. A lady? Right. She's got a mind like a razor and a heart as big as a watermelon. What? What are you talking about? Your wife. Oh, no. No!
