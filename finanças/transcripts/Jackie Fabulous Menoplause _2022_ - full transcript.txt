MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Jackie Fabulous. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Hi, you guys! [LAUGHS] Thank you. My bra is showing. It's real. -Hey! -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Oh, God, I'm not gonna lie. Okay, before I start, just so you guys know, all I talk about is my next big birthday. I'm gonna be 50 in August. -Stop it. Stop. Stop. -[AUDIENCE CHEERING] And I have been having hot flashes -during my shows. -MAN: Whoo! -No "whoo". Fuck you, whoo! -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I announced it to another audience a few weeks ago. "I'm having hot flashes," and they started applauding. And this man in the back said, "We're giving you 'men-applause'". [ALL LAUGHING] I had him killed. He's gone, he's done. [LAUGHS] I had him murdered. It's not funny. I'm not gonna lie, I am kind of nervous but only because this is a lot, like we just got out of a pandemic/pepperoni/ panoramic. Whatever the hell you want to call it. And the CDC doesn't make it easier. We were in New York, in their last announcement, I swear to God, they were like, if you are on New York City streets by yourself, you don't have to wear a mask. Where the fuck am I, sir? I'm in New York. I'm by myself. No one else is on the street with me. Fuck the mask. I'm about to die. Or am I... Am I in the wrong neighborhood? What... I'm not worried about the goddamn mask. Why I'm out here alone? Anybody here give Amazon so much money, you feel like Jeff owes you anal? [CHEERING] And did you hear the whole thing? Did you hear the whole statement? [LAUGHING] An anal? Yeah. If I ever see Jeff in these streets, I'm gonna be like, "You should suck this titty. "I swear to God, you should. "The amount of money I have given you, "the amount of boxes on my porch, "you would think I was rich "and I'm not. I'm lonely. I'm lonely." Sometimes all we had to look forward to was the mail. Is it just me? You know? All right? You get that email that your package has been delivered, "Ahh!" I'm the only one? I'm the only one? Really? Come on. [LAUGHS] I bought so much from Prime that I gave the truck driver my parking space. [ALL LAUGHING] You know how much you gotta shop to have him... give him your space? I got some chalk written on the ground. Prime/Carlos. Only Carlos can park there. He likes strawberry lemonade and tuna fish. And yes, I'm gonna fuck Carlos -'cause I've not had... -[CHEERING] I have not had a man with a job this good in years. Okay? If you gotta fuck anybody, fuck the Prime guy. That's what I'm saying. Ma'am, you're looking shocked. Do you not know, I'm like, is it a church show? Are you confused? [LAUGHS] Looking at her friend like, "She's cussing a lot. Goddamn." [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, I was stuck at home, man. I'm happy to be out. AUDIENCE: Whoo! Aren't we happy to be out? Let's just be blessed for a minute. We all could be dead together and we are out. Anybody here, Zoom teaching or Zoom home schooling their kids? AUDIENCE: Yeah. Yeah. You guys are fantastic. I love watching the moms on social media have nervous breakdowns. 'Cause you're teaching your kids, and you're like, "I did not sign up for this shit. "I gave birth. Put him in school. You'll fix him." Teacher been telling you for two and half years your kid needs Ritalin and therapy. You know why you guys are having a heart attack? 'Cause you didn't know that your kids were assholes. -That's why. -[ALL LAUGHING] You're like, "Stacy is a bitch. Was she always this way?" [LAUGHING] Right, sir? Some of you don't know your kids, and you gotta teach them shit. You're like, "Oh, my God, he's a dummy." [ALL LAUGHING] Just the other day, I was on the train and I heard this mother and daughter, and she was like testing her daughter. You know, school stuff, and she's like, "What are the days of the week?" And she said, "What is today's day?" And her daughter said, "February." So these kids need to go back to school immediately, okay? They're fucking dumb now. That's all I'm saying. If someone you knew in 2010 that in 2020, you would have little Almond Butter or Peppermint at home with you all day, you'd made your husband ejaculate in the backyard, in the kitchen, come in any room, but do not come anywhere near me. Why? 'Cause he gonna be here all goddamn day in ten years. I'm waiting on Biden to forgive the student loans and he's just certainly taking a long ass time. What the fuck? [CHEERING] This man is fixing everything but that. And I voted for him. He's the one I voted for. And here's the thing. I went to law school. Clearly I am not using the degree. Okay? If Biden could get my student loan forgiven, he could bring back slavery. I swear to God, I'd have a job. You know what I'm saying? Every day. Some of you are like, "We can't sign on to that one. We can't. "You had us. But you're tripping now." I missed touring this panoramic. Couldn't go anywhere. You know what's funny though, when you travel, your friends are, like, mean. Like, "Girl, are you going to Chicago? "You gotta have that deep dish. "You gotta have the deep dish. "Girl, you're going to Philly? Yo, cheesesteak. Go here. -"Kansas City? Barbecue!" -AUDIENCE: Whoo! Is there a state vegetable? Okay, take it easy, sir. I'm not finished. Is there a state vegetable that I can support? Look at my fat ass, right? I can't travel around this country eating all this shit. I'll need two tickets to come back with both of my asses. I can't travel around and have all your wonderful food. But let's get down to what I'm really happy about. This thing is being, what is it? Filmed, recorded... I'm old as fuck. ...in New York, and I'm born and raised in the Bronx. I'm so happy. [ALL CHEERING] Let's do it! I cannot believe... Yes, baby. I got a razor blade in my hair right now. Never forget. Aye! But I'm just saying and I lived in LA. Here's the thing. I lived in Los Angeles for the last 20 years. I just moved back a year ago to New York, and I don't give you guys enough credit. You made me so strong, so intelligent, so wise, so brave because the people in LA they're a little, you know, eh... [ALL LAUGHING] You know, they're just... They're pussies. They're pussies. -[ALL CHEERING] -Okay? Not... Okay. I don't wanna get angry messages. Not all of them. Okay? Not all of them, but the men. They're the ones I'm talking about. Because East Coast men, I used to talk shit about you, you are the best men to date. You're normal. Every race. You're fantastic. I love the way you guys treat your life. 'Cause it is very hard to get laid by a creative guy in Hollywood. Because I love comedians, actors, singer, whatever you do, creative. I wanna fuck you. That's just how I... I'm sorry, okay? And when I was in LA, these guys if they're not working, and they're not on TV, their dicks don't work. [ALL LAUGHING] They're like, "Jackie, right now, where I am in my life "and the area you want me to please? I need meditation." Oh, my God. But the men on the East Coast, when you guys are unemployed and not working, the best dick ever. Oh, my God. You borderline abusive East Coast men, I missed you. I missed you so much. Okay? The next day, if I'm like, should I call the cops or call him for another date? That was a good night. That was a good night. I missed you guys. You bottle up inside. That's the way you're supposed to do it. A good American man. All these feelings in Los Angeles... I went to see a guy in LA that I used to date, and when I got to his house, he made me watch a podcast, be on his podcast, watch a movie he was in, he wrote me a song. When is your dick coming out? I'm not an agent, sir. I can't help you with your career. I came over here to fuck. What is going on? All his goddamn feelings. I'm trying to fuck. I'm sorry. My mom's gonna see this. She's gonna be so sad. [LAUGHS] She's gonna be like, "You were raised in the church." Up until 18, Mom, then I left that bitch immediately. [ALL LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] Now here's the thing. Being in LA for so long, I did meet one woman who used to live in New York, and she left because she told me that one man started masturbating on the subway in front of her in New York. So she packed her stuff immediately and moved back to LA. I said, "Bitch, one?" [ALL LAUGHING] "You saw one dick and packed your shit and left? "Do you know how many dicks I have seen before I knew they were for fun?" I've seen local dicks, express dicks, Amtrak dicks, Metro North dicks, Boom bus... I've seen all the dicks. Unaffected by. I'm desensitized to this stuff now. In LA, there was a little Latino dude in the deodorant aisle, jerking off, going to town instead of yelling out "security" and "police", I just looked at him, turned around and walked out, told the lady walking in behind me, "Hey, there's a dude jerking off in aisle seven. "Let him finish," and I walked out. [ALL LAUGHING] You committing a felony, you might as well finish. You're going to jail. You know what I'm saying? But New York, you guys stayed with me when it really mattered. Like in LA, everyone is really, uh, caring about everything. A lot of causes and charities and walks and shit. Petitions, always wanting you to sign shit. I was leaving a grocery store, a handful of bags, struggling to keep them in my hands, right? This lady, out of nowhere, is like, "Will you please sign "our petition for gay rights?" I said, "Gays? You have enough." And I walked off. Isn't that fucked up? No, no, no. If you're gay, you're doing a pretty good job at getting your rights heard. I don't have time to fight for gay rights. I'm a Black woman. I'm busy. I have my own things to worry about. Okay? I'm a Black woman. There you go. Clap it up. I'm a Black-- Clap it up. I'm Black. I want that alone. I don't have time to fight the gay rights. Why? I'm a Black woman. I'm full figured. I'm well over 40. I still want to have a baby at my age. How? You know, I don't know. I grow one hair out of this nipple, that when I pull it out on Monday, it's a full on again on Tuesday. Why is that? How? Every time I laugh or sneeze, a little bit of pee comes out. Yay! That's new. I'm horny all the time. I don't know why. I look pregnant, no matter what I have on. And this is not a baby. This is gravy and frosting. I don't know what this is. And the most fun that I'm having, I grow a goatee every three days. Fuck you and your petition, bitch. Who's fighting for my right, whore? I don't have time to help you. Hey, lesbian family, I'm fucked up too. [ALL LAUGHING] See, in New York, right up in there. Right up in there. Always around. [SIGHS] I need new friends. Because I like my girlfriends to be older than me. I thought I'll learn about life that's how I manifest, you know, success. But because I'm gonna be 50, I didn't know that my close girlfriends are a lot older than me. Some of them are prudes, not much fun, 'cause I'm still a party girl. I didn't go away to college, so I'm like putting together a vacation for me and my older girlfriends. We're Zooming. I'm the Zoom coordinator, right? I'm, like, we should go to Mexico. Why? I lived in LA for so long, you can get luxury over there for almost nothing. And the oldest girlfriend in the posse is like, "Mexico?" [EXCLAIMING] "Don't they kidnap women into sexual slavery? "In Mexico?" I'm like, "Bitch, how are we qualified for that job at our age?" [ALL LAUGHING] Are we gonna be the nannies teach them English, make the uniforms? Cook them meals? You told me you have arthritis. You have bad knees and a bad back. Don't nobody want no old ass sex slave. We have aged out the sex trafficking market. You stupid bitch! Oh, my God! So, yeah, I need new friends. Now, y'all see. Oops! Is that a hot flash? Here we go. Am I getting naked? And if I do, you're welcome. I've never dated a white guy in Los Angeles. There's no reason. I like all of you guys. You guys won't hit on me. I don't know why. I'm very white friendly, right? I'm not angry right now. I know my father. I'm rare. There's not many of me out there in these streets. [LAUGHING] I want to try a white guy. What do you guys taste like? Vanilla? Butterscotch? [ALL LAUGHING] I've never had one. I have no idea what it's like. I'll do what I gotta do to attract a white guy. I'll put the work in. I'm willing to cook with less seasoning and... [ALL LAUGHING] Put raisins in food that shouldn't have any goddamn raisins in them and... [LAUGHS] Ask for the manager every time we go to a restaurant. I'll do what I gotta do to make you white guys feel at home. I had one white guy, he's like, "How do I turn a big Black woman like you on?" I said, "I am very turned on by a Morton's Steakhouse." I love that place. The ones that have large meat. I don't care how large yours is. You know what I'm saying? Feed me first. That's all I'm saying. I'm way less judgemental when I'm full. Black guys in LA, they were hard to come by because they like everything. New York men are more like, "I like this, I stick with that." In LA, they're like, "I date everybody." It's a fucking buffet out there. I had me one and I'm like, You know what? We go together. I wouldn't even ask. You're my boyfriend. I can't find none of y'all. Okay? We go together. You know what? I attract a Black guy, I always get the reaclimation Black guy. You know what that is, sir? I feel like you know what I'm talking about. Know what that is? I get the Black guy who has not had a Black girlfriend in years. And then he meets me. He's like, "Oh, girl, I wanna come back. "I wanna come back. Can you train me?" You need to watch BET, I haven't got time to train you on how to be a Black man. But I knew that he and I weren't gonna work. You know why? He had a lot of white requests. He was like, "Jackie, let's get up at 5:00 a.m., "and go for a run... "on the beach." [LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY] The third one. I'm like, "Why? Is the gym closed? They open at 9:00 a.m. "What the fuck is wrong with you?" And he's like, "Jackie, I wanna... "I wanna make love to you in the shower. "Let's get in the shower." I'm like, "Can you see me? "I don't do water sports." I'm like, "You know what? Before I say no, let me go get "my big pink plastic floral Walmart shower cap. "If I have that big ass hat on, and your dick still gets hard, "you deserve it. Okay? "You're a fucking trooper. That is not a come-fuck-me hat." We all know. We all got that hat at home, okay? He was like he wanted to go hiking on the first date. Hiking! I said, "That's white. I'm sorry. That is really white." How about I now act out my own homicide? Law & Order. How about that? I'm not going hiking with a goddamn stranger. In the woods? Really? Do you not have TV? -WOMAN: That's right. -That's right. No, no dates in the middle of nowhere. Hell no. I used to have a propensity to attract young dudes. They like me because I have a very youthful... I'm happy. They like happy. But they're easy to get. It's like shooting fish in a barrel, getting a young guy. But you can lure them into your house with a game console. There's no challenge. [ALL LAUGHING] With a young guy, PS5, penis forever. That's all I'm saying. Is that what the "P" stands for? It should, it should. [LAUGHS] Oh, God. Old guys. Ooh. I do well at attracting the old dude, boy. You know why? You know why I attract the old guy? Why? I get the Bluetooth man. Got a little old ass Black guy with the Bluetooth. Is that you, sir? I feel like you might be that dude. No, right here, baldy. Yeah. Where is it? Are you wearing one right now? You wearing one right now? I get the Black guy with the Bluetooth on all day for no goddamn reason. I was in a bar with a guy Bluetooth face blinking for three hours. Turn that off. It's midnight on Saturday. Ain't nobody looking for you. I feel like a lot of old guys don't know how to get laid though. They're out of the game. They don't really know how to, the lingo. I was in one show, guy in the front row, cute, 49-years-old. I was joking. I was like, "Do you have high blood pressure?" And he said, "Of course." [ALL LAUGHING] That's not how you get your dick sucked, sir. That's not the way. But the advantage of dating men at 50 is that I'm honest. You know what I mean? Like that whole thing about all night long, isn't that a fucking lie? The only thing I want all night long is sleep and a shoe sale. You know what I'm saying? I do not want dick all night long. But I can say no to certain dates now. When you get older, you learn. I got my first ever, my first ever dick pic. I've only got one in a text. This guy liked me who wanted to sell it to me, a text of his penis 11 inches long. Eleven inches. No. Eleven inches. And my girlfriend said, "You're a big girl. You can handle that." I said, "Bitch, I'm not hollow. What the fuck? "There's shit inside. There's muscles and bones." Anything that big enters your body, you know what it's called? An intruder. What's that? Is that a lung, bitch, or a spleen? You don't need any more organs. You're finished. You're full. Oh, boy, this pandemic has been something, I'm not gonna lie. How did I spend it? I spent it at home, with my retired Jamaican mother. Yeah, that's where I've been all this time. I moved back home, I'm in the same childhood bedroom that I grew up in. The first orgasm I've ever had was in this room, and I was alone then, too. [ALL LAUGHING] Life is full circle, is all I'm saying. Life is full circle. Stay humble. Remember where you came from. It is hard to rub one out in front of stuffed animals, is all I'm saying. It is hard to masturbate in front of stuffed animals because she has thrown nothing away. Every key chain, every greeting card, every boyfriend is on the wall. I'm like, "Mommy, some of these niggas are dead. "Throw it in the trash. "Let me have my life back." You know what's ironic? My period began in this bedroom, and it's going to end. [ALL LAUGHING] It's not fucking funny, sir. It's sad as shit. [LAUGHS] Puberty and menopause in the same bedroom. Help me, Jesus! So it's me and my mother, and I'm not gonna lie, you know, on TV shows, the mother and daughter become best friends when they both become... when she becomes a grown up? Motherfucking lie. I am trying not to graduate from chardonnay to cocaine. I am trying. It's me. No one notices how much you drink until you move back home with your family. My mother can tell when I'm pouring grape juice, or orange juice, she's like, "Jacqueline, it's not even noon yet. Are you pouring wine?" "You're lucky it's not heroin. "I should be high all goddamn day. "I live here with you." She's a liar. I didn't realize that. You don't know when you're growing up that your mother is a liar because she's the neighborhood older lady and the neighborhood is worried about her. You know, with COVID, she's in that age group where if she got COVID, she'd die in a half hour. So I've been worried about her for the whole year. Okay? People coming around, they're like, "Miss Carol, are you staying home? "Are you being..." She's like, "I'm so scared of getting COVID. "Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ! I don't go anywhere. "I stay home to be nice and safe." This bitch is gone every day for three hours. I don't know where she's going. She comes back with a bag with one can of ginger ale, four bananas, an apple. This ain't essential, bitch. You're gonna die! What are you doing? She pays all of her bills in person like it's 1990. "Jackie, I want to pay my maintenance bill in person." I have 11 computers on me right now. I can't pay shit for her online. She's obsessed with how many things she owns, the number of them, utensils. She's like, "Jackie, I had nine forks. "Where are two of my forks?" They're in my fucking sock drawer. Why would I have your forks? So what I do now, I go on Amazon and bought her 498 forks. I'm not gonna have this fight every day. If she can't find it, I'm gonna order a thousand of them. She has never tried to speak proper English... my whole life. Been here longer than I've been alive. We had a new baby born in our family. New baby boy, new baby cousin. My mom's on the phone with the baby boy on FaceTime telling him nursery rhymes... I think. She's like, "The itchy, bitchy spider..." That's not how it goes. But she keeps trying, she keeps trying. [WITH JAMAICAN ACCENT] "The humpy dumpy fell off of the wall. "And little Miss Muffet eat him." That's two stories. And you made them horror stories. None of that shit is right. She's a little bit racist, little bit racist, because my father, he passed away four years ago and he was the complexion of Lionel Richie. He was a very light skinned Black man. My mother is a very dark skinned woman. So, whenever I bring home a man who wasn't like my father and Mom's like, "Jacqueline, your boyfriend is a monkey." I'm like, "Mommy, I appreciate the honesty, "but he's standing right here. "Can he go home first?" I'm a casual marijuana smoker. -AUDIENCE: Whoo! -[ALL APPLAUDING] You guys will clap at the weirdest shit. I'm a casual marijuana smoker but I don't smoke in front of my mother. I really can't. I mean, I do in my bedroom, but when I smoke a joint, I do it out the window. I'm like a window AC unit. Half my body is outside, half is inside trying to get high and have her not smell that shit. Because I learned about weed. I learned about weed in California. I'm glad they're gonna make it legal in New York because we're all high all the time anyway. Um, in California though, it's a different thing though. It's everywhere. The kids are high, the mailman, your doctor, everyone's high in California. [ALL LAUGHING] You have to go to a dispensary. My dispensary was next door to my bank. You understand that's not the real world? And my girlfriend had to teach me about weed out there. She's like, "Jackie, I want to ease you into the world of weed slowly. "I'm gonna give you an edible. "But you can't have the whole edible, only eat the corner." I said, "I'm a big girl. I want to eat the whole thing." She's like, "No, you'll die. Only eat the corner. That's it." So I ate the corner, brought the rest home. Uh, I ate the whole thing. [ALL LAUGHING] I got so high, I called an ambulance for myself. Do you understand? When the guys got to my house, I was wearing my old wedding dress, a parka, a cowboy hat, a pair of skis. Bitch, you know I don't ski. Where did I get skis from? But when you're high, you find shit around the house. I shouldn't have got high. I wish I had gotten my father to try weed because he died of Parkinson's. And it was kind of rough though. They don't have any faith that I can take care of them as they get older, mother and father. They don't understand this job. I went home one time unannounced. Both of them opened the front door. They had on sunglasses that cover your whole head when you're a 100, you just had surgery. I said, "What did you both do?" "Jackie, we got Lasik together." [ALL LAUGHING] I said, "Why didn't you call me?" "We didn't want to bother you." So, if I came home and you were both blind, and there was a service dog on the porch, wouldn't that be an inconvenience? And who gets surgery as a family? What do you have? A fucking Groupon? Do I have to move back here? My father was on so many medications with the Parkinson's. But I'm not gonna lie. They were fantastic. [LAUGHS] I tried some. He's gone. He died. They're all still there. I'm like, "Well, let's see what he was taking." One of them was a stool softener. [ALL LAUGHING] I'm like, "I wouldn't mind shitting faster, "you get more done during the day. "I'll try a stool softener." Anxiety meds. I'm anxious right now! Sleeping pills? What's it like to go to bed and not get up pee 18 times before midnight? Fucking miss that. My father, when he passed away, when we were trying to go buy the coffin and stuff, but I'll tell you the anger, because it's like trying to buy a Toyota Corolla. Anybody ever had family die and see what a racket it is trying to get them buried? The fucking caskets are made of, like, unusual mahogany. He's underground. The man selling it was like, "The coffin, it stays airtight." [ALL LAUGHING] I'm not down there with him. I don't give a shit if it leaks. I don't give a shit if water gets in there. "It's airtight." It's underground! Think he'd come alive and die again. No one cares. It's underground. I wouldn't know. He can wake up and shit. "Did you see your father?" No, he's underground. My mother and aunt and me made the arrangements for his burial, and my mother and aunt are Keeping Up With the Joneses', show offs, snobs. Okay? If I wasn't there, they'd had him buried fucking Elvis style. The way they were ordering shit that we didn't have, they'd want to put him in a private house. They wanted to have a limo bring him. Bitch, you don't have... And this man died, left us no fucking money. I want to have him cremated and put him in the goddamn kitchen next to the plates. We don't have any money. It's a racket and the guy selling us all the equipment at the funeral home, he kept trying to upsell us. Upsell people who were living. He's like, "Don't you think "it's good to buy extra plots "for like you and like your mom and your auntie?" I said, "Sir, no one's going to die ever again. "This is the last fucking person in my family to die. "I'm not buying a fucking Corolla, sir." I'm a little sad though, because I didn't give my parents grandchildren. I don't have any kids. I'm not always happy about that. You know, I don't. I had a doctor in my last UIN. I swear to God. His name was Dr. Cox. No one in the office understood why I couldn't stop laughing. I'm like, "No one? Like y'all... Did you hear? Dr. Cox!" And he gave me an examination. And he was like, "You know, you better hurry up." When you're looking for the whole baby stuff, they can tell when you haven't had kids. I'm like, "Doctor, I am trying." 'Cause I don't have any. And when I date guys who are young, who still want kids... I knew one guy who was so worried about having babies 'cause everything still works. Everything still works biologically. There's the word, but it's definitely on liquidation sale now. It's on clearance. You gotta go to the back. You gotta get the manager. You gotta get the ladder. You gotta get on the top shelf. When you get it down, you gotta... [BLOWS AIR] It's old, but it's there. These young guy are like, "What do you use for birth control?" I said, "If you could get my old ass pregnant, "that baby's name is Congratulations- You're-A-Father." Are you crazy? Good luck. I almost had to get a job... Whew! [LAUGHING] During the panoramic. Oh, my God, I almost had to get a job. I had a Zoom interview. And she noticed that on my resume, I have not had a job since 2010. [SCATTERED CLAPPING] No, that's actually a good thing, but I was in the corporate world, she didn't know about all this. She's like, "So I see you haven't had an office job since 2010. "What have you been doing?" Guess what the wrong answer is? "The best I can." [ALL LAUGHING] That's the right answer, but that's not getting me work. I miss having a nine-to-five though because I miss my girlfriends. I miss having girlfriends at work. I had one girlfriend. My biggest memory. The most fond memory of this young girl, 35-years-old at the time, and she's like, "Jackie, I'm a virgin. "I want sex." And I'm like, "I can't help you with that shit." I said to her, "What are you waiting for?" She said, "I'm waiting for my prince to comes on his white horse and sweep me off my feet." I was like, "Bitch, he ain't coming. "No wonder you're so angry. You need to get some dick." But she's like, "You know what? I met a guy. He might be the one." I said, "Okay, let me ask about this guy. "Tell me about him." She said, "Well, his name is Darryl. "He used to play for the NBA, wears a size 16 shoe." I said, "Bitch, do you have a suicide wish?" You don't know how to drive. That's like passing a driver's test and going to buy a Hummer. Go buy a Prius and learn how to drive before you die. And she was like, "You know what, Jackie? "I'm going to go slow. I'm going to get to know Darryl." I said, "Exactly. Get to know Darryl. While you get to know him, "give him my card. Okay?" [LAUGHS] [APPLAUSE] I've been driving truck for 20 years is all I'm saying. I know what I'm doing. Here's the thing about my job, though. I'm always fighting three different girls. I'm Jackie. As you guys know me. My mother still calls me Jacqueline, but I'm also Jaquisha, the Black girl from the Bronx that comes out at the wrong time at every corporate job. Secret Santa. What's the normal amount? Ten bucks, maybe. Every now and then, 20. I had a job where they raised it to $50. Fifty! Jaquisha jumped the fuck out. I said, "$50? She's still got to buy steak, bro, fuck Denise, fuck this company. "My bad. Was that Jaquisha? "How'd she get here? I'm sorry. She's been to jail. "My bad. I don't know how she got in here." Oh, my God. I'm not wearing any kind of Spanx. It's just-- It's just a thong, a bra and the truth. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] No, what are you clapping for? [CHUCKLES] I try to put on Spanx when the whole COVID ended. Then you go back out on the streets, almost fell out the window. Oh, my God, they're very tight. You get out of practice. 'Cause I'm an actor, you know, most comedians are. What they don't tell you is that, I'm-- What I'm really called is a fat actor. That's really the category I'm in. When I get emails from my agents, they always say, "Jackie, we're looking for somebody older, "average-looking and experienced". I email them back every time, "Who's this for? "I'm not older, I'm experienced. "Average looking? Clearly, I'm adorable. "Overweight? This is called voluptuous mochaccino." They email back every time, "Are you going?" Well, yeah, I'mma be there. I'll be the first girl there. [LAUGHING] You know, I have a mirror. I'm not crazy. That's when you're like, you're being kind of rude in emails, is all I'm saying. [LAUGHS] Oh, my God, I gained so much weight during the pandemic. It was funny, though. Women are the biggest liars. They're like, "Oh, my God, I've gained so much pandy weight." Bitch, you were a chunky monkey pre-pandemic. [LAUGHS] As was I. I just got chunkier now. I hate people, during a pandemic, those people who are like, "You know what? During all this, "I pick up CrossFit and I'm learning Mandarin. "And now I'm knitting my car cover." Bitch, I tried to give myself my own tattoos, okay? I tried to pierce shit that shouldn't be pierced. Fuck you and your activities during COVID. No one should be fatter when this is done than white women. You women started baking like slaves when this shit started. Okay? Between the zucchini bread, and the banana bread and the fucking sourdough the size of my head, and I'm looking at your recipes on TikTok, Stacy, and she ain't gaining a goddamn pound. Fuck you, Stacy. I grew a third titty during this pandemic. And it's made of sourdough, okay? It's not fair. All of my shirts now fit like jackets. You know what that means? I love denim shirts, and I had this-- I put on the same tight ass, small one from last year, I had a line of buttons on this side, a line of buttons on this side, looking at me like, bitch, you know, we can't close. You need Aero-- You need uh... Tsk, what do you need? Aerobics? Is that the word? Cardio! You need cardio. [LAUGHS] I don't even know the word for exercise. That's how much I don't do it. What's the word for moving around quickly? [JACKIE LAUGHS] [APPLAUDING] Oh, my fat ass! I don't even know the terminology for working out. I have a lot of personal trainer friends who stalk me online. They're like, "Jackie, I will work you out for free. "What do you want to look like?" I'm like, "I want to look chubby." Poof! Oh, my God. You're so good. You should charge. 'Cause I'm still in that middle-- I'm in between the big girl and the normal sizes. But when I walk around the big girl stores, the big girl mannequins look at me like, "Psst. "Bitch, one more Snickers, you're in here with us. One more Snickers..." [LAUGHS] "...you're in here with us." Now, I've got to join all these programs. I've done them all before, but I'm going to keep doing it until I get-- You know what I want. Weight Watchers, great company. But it's a lot of rules. The one rule I can't take is the weekly weigh-in. It's always in the front lobby, but in front of the glass storefront and the car pulls up and you get on the scale, and then, they get mad at me if I want to get butt naked at the weigh-in. When you're at home, are you wearing a full fucking outfit? No. If you don't want to see a big, naked brown girl in the front window, put the scales in the back. Otherwise, areolas, coming out, okay? I got to be down 0.2 by tomorrow. Let's go! Jenny Craig is good, but it's expensive. You gotta go there every week to get your bag of food, and it's like, always $100, $200. Then, they're like, "Now you got your food from us. "Now go to the grocery store, and buy some fruit and some salad." Bitch, I give you $100. Go in the employee fridge and steal somebody's salad and bring it out here and give it to me. Remember how they had body types? You know, they said you were apple or pear and... I'm-- I consider myself a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Tempur-Pedic mattress. I'm safe. You won't fall off when you're on me. Can you balance a glass of wine on my belly? Yes, 'cause I have tried. [LAUGHS] Nice and safe. I had gall bladder surgery, too, because I was just enjoying life too much. And the doctor's like, "You don't have to have surgery. "You can change your lifestyle. "No more red meat. No more fried food. "No more alcohol, no more sugar." I said, "Do you have a scalpel on you right now? Go get it, right now! "Fucking demon inside of my body. Remove it, remove it. "How did it get in here?" You know what I'm saying? All those things, I like. Are you crazy? But here's the thing about me and all this weight stuff. I have an unrealistic amount of confidence when it comes to approaching a really, really, really hot guy. Okay? I'm like, "We're all going to die. Fuck it. He might like this. "You have no idea." Example... I had a project that did not come out. It was me and Will Smith. Not alone. Other comics, too, but Will Smith is the primary focus right here, right? I'm like, Jackie, you are a professional person. When you meet him, don't act the fool. You're at work. He's just a man. At work, he walked in the room to meet me. Both my nipples fell off. Oh, my-- [CHUCKLES] I'm like, "Oh, my God! "Will, I didn't know they could fall off. My bad. I'm so sorry." I was star struck, and he's a nice guy. I mean, a normal, respectful, not a superstar. A really nice guy. And I got pictures with him, of course. A thousand pictures with him. I took one, put it on IG. Women came for me, okay? They were like, "Jackie, he is happily married." And first of all, I have heard for years he has an open marriage. This is not new. I know he had some drama, but years ago, and when I met him, and I got over the starstruckness, I approached him with, "I hear you have open marriage energy." Okay? [LAUGHS] I shouldn't have, but I did. [LAUGHS] Women were like, "Jackie, he is with Jada. They are happily married. "And what if you had to go through Jada to get to Will?" I said, "Bitch, I will fuck his whole family. Are you crazy? "They're all gorgeous. Jada could get it, her mama could get it. "His older son could get it, both those kids--" And they're not kids. I Googled it. They are grown up. I'm not a pedophile. I'll fuck his whole family. [LAUGHS] I did the research. Like, all of the Wayans comedians, I know them all. Well, most of them, and they're in my age group. But they don't have wives. Why not? I'll marry a Wayans. I'll fuck a Wayans. I recently met Chris Rock. He's been out there on, you know, Late Night, saying, "I'm ready to date. I'm ready for a girlfriend." I met him. I'm like, "Hey." And he's like, "No, we can't. We can't." If 56-year-old Chris Rock dated a fat, Black, 50-year-old comic, he'd be a fucking legend, okay? There'd be a statue made of him. [CHUCKLES] -He'd get a Mark Twain Prize now. -[APPLAUDING] But I know what these guys look for. That's all I'm saying. I understand that. I know where the confidence comes from. So when you join Weight Watchers, you get an app on your phone like Facebook. I'm not gonna lie, though. It's a depressing place. Ladies are on there, with their pictures. Self-deprecation, but in a sad way. They're like, "I hate my body. I want to die. I don't love myself." I'm like, "Hey, you are beautiful and worthy in the body you have, right. "You don't lose weight and then get confidence. "You are hot and worthy and bangable in the body you have right now." That's the way it works. [APPLAUDING] That's why... That is why I tell men all the time, "If you want to hit this, come hit this now. "Okay? Because when I hit my goal weight, "ya'll not gonna be good enough for me anymore. So, come get it now. "While my standards are a little bit lower." You know what I'm saying? Because back in the day, if you'd got me in my 20s and 30s and said, "Jackie, would you give so-and-so a blowjob "for a job, for work, for a role in a movie?" 20 to 30s, I'd have been like, "Of course not. "I'm a woman of character. I would never." Now, at 50, I'd be like... "Whose dick is it?" [LAUGHS] I'm just saying, I want background. Just give me some background. That's all I'm saying. [LAUGHS] Oh, God. I, um... I want to-- I want to rant, like gossip for a second. The whole J-Lo and Ben Affleck. Oh, have you been watching this? [SCREAMS] Who loves it on the low? Who lowkey-- Like, I'm loving all-- Thank you! You saw the video today on IG? They're kissing in Miami. Oh, my God. I watched it 300 times. Okay, first of all, I'm a huge J-Lo fan. I fucking love her. Bronx, Bronx. I just adore her, and I like the fact that she left A-Rod. I like-- Fuck A-Rod. I mean, you're a nice guy, I'm sure. But he's gone. I'm glad he's gone. A-Rod is just corny to me. He was very close to being the first Latino My Pillow guy, I swear to God. Was he not? He's very close to selling frying pans at QVC. He's not the one, J-Lo, is all I'm saying. And that video, the video of her and Ben kissing, people lost their mind, right? They're like, "How?" And her son was in the video. He popped in and popped out. And they were like, "How can you make out with a new boyfriend, new-ish, "in front of your boyfriend?" You can make out with your boyfriend in front of your kids if he's fucking Batman. He's Batman. Yes, you can make out with your boyfriend if he's Batman. And you guys-- I see your faces like, "Jackie, Batman is not real." Neither are J-Lo's relationship, and we're having a good time. We're having fun. Just enjoy it. Sidenote, sorry. I just love J-Lo. I wanna talk about it. 'Cause I don't really date. I really-- I don't like the whole awkwardness and the fakeness. I'd rather just play around until I fall in love. I'm a happy single girl. I'm an oxymoron. I'm actually happy and single, not married. We'll get to that later. But I'm happy and I'm not married. A lot of girls are like, they're not happy they're not with someone. I'm like-- My girlfriends are like, "You like going around? "Just banging dudes you don't know?" Yeah. I thought it was called being single. Why are you judging? I don't understand. I've online date. Who here's done online dating? Online dating is awesome. I used to do it. I met a guy online, we saw, like, three movies in a week. I said, "When are you and I gonna stop watching movies "and start making some? I'm kind of bored." He was like, "You're a nice lady, I want to be a gentleman." I said, "Who the hell told you to do that?" He said, "You're the kind of girl I could marry." "You are not my soul mate. FYI." But here's how I got through the pandemic. I accidentally got in a really serious relationship... when it started. Um, because COVID cut down, for a single girl, it cut down hoeing. Cut down hoeing, cut down booty calls, cut down, you know, handling your stuff discreetly. So, they're like, you can't date. Don't talk-- I'm like, "I'm not gonna be alone for a year. Somebody love me!" So, I found someone who I've known for a long time. But I told him so many lies to make him think that I am the quarantine wife he'd want. I said, "Look, I am a domestic goddess. "I cook every meal from scratch. "And I grow my own vegetables." All the lies. None of that true. Because somehow I found a unicorn Black man who actually does cook and garden. So, we're having dinner. He made me a veggie salad, and then he pulled out a cucumber. Not his dick, a real cucumber. I'm like, "What's this?" He's like, "You and I should garden together." I'm like, "Why?" He goes, "I'm prepared." He made these stacks of greens that had the roots. Gave me one stack. He said, "Yo, bring this home and plant it. "I'll plant mine at the same time. "And we can watch them grow together as a couple." I'm like, "Aww, my God, I lied to you. "I'd rather catch COVID. Look at these nails. Are you crazy? "I do not garden. "I barely have the strength to shower every Friday. "We're in a pandemic. I'm not gonna plant asparagus. "You want me and you to be Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg? "Guess what? You're Martha. I'm Snoop. I don't do any of that shit. "I lied to you. My God, my bad. "Ain't none that true." I barely know him. That's why it worked. I met him in our 20s, but I was away, I was married, all this kind of crap. That's how it works. Because when you snoop, and try to figure out a guy's background, what do you find, ladies? A family in Virginia. Exactly. So, I do not research anything. [CHUCKLES] If God wants to remove him, remove him. Because here's the problems we're kind of having now. Um... He's uh-- He's jealous. He's a very jealous guy. I thought-- I thought that would be hot. It's not. Here's the thing. During the quarantine, what did he and I do for a year? Sex, drinking, smoking. It was amazing/horrible. Of course, COVID. And I said, "Look, when I go back to work, "you should know it's usually me around nothing but dudes. "And these dudes are my friends and they're 40, 45 years old and up." Boyfriend's also 50. I said, "When I go back to work, this is my environment." He's like, "Jackie. I'm afraid I'm not enough for you, "and when you go back to work, you would cheat on me with one of these guys. I said, "You think if I get side dick, "he's going to also be a 50-year-old man?" I said, "If I get side dick, he's gonna be half your age, you fool." Having two boyfriends that are both 50? That's like having two part-time jobs and they're both at Subway. What the fuck? You ain't got no goals, bitch? You don't want to dream bigger than that? I'mma have two boyfriends with a fucking bad back, sleep apnea and prostate problem. I want a younger, faster, bigger, stronger, harder man, okay? I'm not an idiot. She said, "Right." [LAUGHS] The hell, yeah. You understand. He just bought DJ equipment. Yeah, at 50-years-old. I got to walk around the ghost of DJs past, to go lay down 'cause he has all the equipment in the bedroom. I gotta walk around Grandmaster Flash's gravesite to go get laid. But the reason why I'm so into him, if I can be honest with you guys, let's keep it real. He's hot. That's almost-- That's almost it. You know why? My whole life, I would always date the really great guy with the great job and... He loved God, took care of his kids and I would cheat on every good guy. They are boring. This guy is the bad guy and I'm having a great time. We're having a great time because his dick is the size of a universal remote. Not the one you get it for free from cable. The one you gotta go to Best Buy, and get a bigger one with the buttons. Ya'll know how they work? That one. That's the one. Won't he do it? God is good, all the time. All the time, God is good. [LAUGHS] I barely know him and I'm having fun. He has a daughter. She's either 4 or 14. I have no fucking idea. I have no idea. I'm not gonna ask her. [LAUGHS] I'm not. He's like, "Jackie, you'd be a great role model for my daughter." I'm like," I have been drinking since ten o'clock yesterday. "I can't be nobody's mentor in a fucking pandemic." All the time together that I realized that it was too much time. I was on his couch, like, the 19th day in a row. The first-- When the pandemic first started, he'd look at me and say things like, "Do you have any idea how beautiful you are, how beautiful your smile is?" Now, he's like, "Are those all your real teeth?" So... I went back home after that, that was too much time. Now here are my new philosophies and rules at being 50 or almost. Um... The term cougar, I don't like. I don't like the term cougar. I think it's offensive. When a man calls me that, I'm hearing you telling me you can't please me. Because when you date men who are 40 and up, they have adult children. I had one guy, kept calling me a cougar. He had a son who was 25 and hot. He was 45. Hey, you call me a cougar one more time, I'm gonna fuck your son. -[APPLAUDING] -Okay? I can be your girlfriend or your daughter-in-law. You decide. It's up to you. Just don't call me names, is all I'm saying. Don't call me names. I realized that I don't like adult toy shops in LA, compared to here. They are very different, okay? In New York, a sex shop is a secret. You don't tell anybody you're going. You go at midnight, it's in the village. It's underground. You gotta wear a ski mask. You gotta have a password. You got to give a hand stamp, urine sample. It's fucking private. In LA, these sex shops are glass storefronts. Like a shoe store. Merchandise in the window. I went in one time, they had a DJ. They had a basket. Are we in Target? What the hell is going on in here? When you walk in, customer service attacks you. Like, "Can I help you?" "Oh, my God. You can see me?" 'Cause I already had a vibrator in my hand the size of a toaster that was diesel powered. You know, I don't want you in my business, ma'am. And you get to the cashier, they want your emails so they can send you sales. I don't want no email for this nasty ass merchandise. Do not email me. I have a lot of Caucasian girlfriends. The difference between my white girlfriends and my Black girlfriends are huge because my Black girlfriends, I feel like they're repressed. They don't talk about sex, we're kind of shy about it. We keep kind of private. White girls, the ultimate oversharers. Oh, my God. My white girlfriend, I was like, "Look, my boyfriend wants to watch porn together as a couple." And she was like, "Porn?" "That's how I bought this house. Want to see some of mine?" "No, no, no, no, no." No, I just want advice. What the fuck? [CHUCKLES] You know what's different now with men and dating? It's hard to-- It's hard to get choked during sex. Is that too much? Was that-- I didn't have any segue or transition. 'Cause you know why. Most men are afraid of, you know, jail. [LAUGHS] Back in the day, they can rough you up and everything will be okay. But now, like, I asked my boyfriend for a little bit of choking during sex recently. And he's behind me. I'm like, okay. Position. He's behind me. Perfect. His hand came around, but then he ended up in, like, a nice little, gentle cuddle like this. I'm like, "You don't know, the difference between-- "There's a difference between cuddle and choke. You're not doing it right." I was, uh... I'm not ashamed to admit that with the dating problems and wondering about men, if somebody were to ask me, "Jackie, you know, are you gay?" My answer is usually, "Not yet. Not yet." [LAUGHS] "Not yet. I'm still working on it. "I'm still trying to find something in this area." I tried to be gay for a semester in college. Anybody else try a woman when you were in college? -[SCATTERED CHEERING] -Way in the back. I had to leave because, first of all, women's bodies, very hard to figure out. There are a lot of hills, valleys, dark holes, put my hand in the wrong hole, lost my class ring, a good watch. You gotta be careful. [LAUGHS] Women, we talk a lot. We're very emotional. I'd try another time and she wouldn't shut up. The whole time, she was like, "Oh, my God, What are you thinking? "How do you feel? What do you think?" I think I'm going to go back to dick. Oh, my God. This is what it's like, gentlemen? Jesus Christ. [LAUGHS] I got a text today from a guy that I had a one-nighter with. And uh, isn't it funny how you text men back faster, if you know they had a big dick? Let's keep it real. This is the church side. Let's talk to this side. This side is like, "Lord, have mercy. Jesus." And this side is, like, "Dicks! Yes!" [LAUGHS] You know, I'm not going to cheat on my boyfriend. I love him. But, you know, whenever you get a text from a dick that size, you have to hit him back quickly 'cause, you know, you have to be kind. You don't know. in the future, you got to keep your bases covered. I'm not going to be alone again. I can't do it anymore. In LA, I did not get laid all. I had the most underutilized pussy in the state of California. I'm ashamed. They would not have sex. These men out there are so consumed with the business. But here in New York, I love the way, guy, that kind of gangster. Like, weed being legal here is great for my boyfriend. Because when he was going to get weed, I'm like, "Go get us some weed." He'd put on a black track-suit, a ski mask. What the fuck? I don't want meth. I want marijuana. Where are you going? Weed free, Kurtis Blow. You don't gotta do this no more. What's wrong with you? When a guy asks me, "How many men have you made love to before me?" I'll tell them the number, but I'm going to use creative accounting. Okay? This is how I do it. If you and I have only had sex in a car, you don't count. It's dangerous. We all could die, okay? If you and I have only done it in your mom's house, you're a loser and need privacy because I'm a screamer. You understand, okay? If you and I have only had sex in my house, you homeless. I'm not going to bone somebody homeless knowingly. [CHUCKLES] Okay? Most importantly, if you've never given me an orgasm, you don't count. -'Cause my motto is... -[APPLAUDING] Yeah, go ahead and clap that. [APPLAUDING] It's getting so deep. Because my motto is, If I don't come, you don't count. That's on the back of my car. That's my Biden sticker. "If I don't come, you don't count." That's nasty. I wouldn't do that. That's gross. The walk of shame, never subscribed to that. I don't understand. What's the-- I call it a walk of pride. When I get laid, I will have my purse like a baton walking out of the house like, "Yay! Guess who got some? mister mailman. What's up?" I don't know why we're ashamed to get laid. What's funny is that, I recently asked my boyfriend to watch porn. And you know what's funny, I'm like, "You pick the category." I'm like, "You have lead. Pick whatever you're into." That could have been anything. He picked Black BBW. I said, "You want to watch us fuck? "Turn the mirror around. Why are we going online?" [LAUGHS] Every movie he picked out, it looked like me, it looked like me. I'm like, "Do you have a fat girl fetish? You're into this?" Oh, God, it's just a... [CHUCKLES] I'm a feminist. Clearly, I'm trying to do what men do, what he does at this age. I'm like, "I can do whatever men do." 'Cause he's been a weed smoker since he was like, four. And I'm like, "I can smoke what you smoke." So he made me smoke when he smoked to show me that I can't. He rolled it, I had a puff at his dinner table. I got up to go to the bathroom, I stopped in the hallway to lay down and take a nap. Do you understand how high you gotta be to need rest immediately? But one of the real reasons why I left LA, if I were to be real with you guys, I was getting high too often. The weed was everywhere. I was enjoying the release, and not being all in my head all the time. First time, so that's probably why I moved because LA, they have pre-rolls. Mystery pre-roll. You don't know what the hell is in them. It could be PCP, acid, crack. You don't know what's in them. I had two pre-rolls and me and this guy I was dating at the time were in my apartment smoking these mystery pre-rolls. A level of high I can't even explain. All the lights were off. The room is dark, he's on the couch. I'm sitting on his lap straddling him, we're about to you know... [POPS MOUTH] Right? And... [LAUGHS] And we're in the middle of it, we're so high. But when I tell you I got so high, I was straddling him, he was inside of me. I got so high in the middle of the whole thing. I was like, "Who is this?" I'm looking around in the dark for clues. I'm like, "Where are his sneakers? "Is he wearing a hat? Where are his keys? You know how high you got to be to be like, "Whose dick is this?" And then you're like, "Did I consent? God damn! I don't even have time for court. "I hope this is okay." And then the lights come on, we're done. I'm like, "Whoo! Thank God. There's you. "It could've gone really badly for you. "Thank God I knew who you were. Jesus Christ. That was scary." [CHUCKLES] So, with all the lights off with him and I, I didn't have to make my normal announcement, like I normally do. When you're my age, 50, your body changes, all right? So I have to let men know that, you know, I now have a salt and pepper fun box. She said in Jamaican, "Uh-uh". I heard that. I heard a "Uh-uh". [LAUGHS] So, now, I have to let new boyfriends know before the unveiling, to get them ready, so they know, from the belly button down, I'm Morgan Freeman. Anybody want to watch a movie? Shawshank? Seven? I want to make a request. For the gentleman. Some advice. Um... If you know that a blow job is not your thing, that it's not the way you climax. Can you please tell a bitch? Your lady is down there bobbing for apples for fucking hours. The sun has gone down, I want to check my email, see my family again. I want to eat. I had a full, flat iron when we started. It's full, curly Afro now. You'll see that vein on my forehead about to pop out. If you don't come this way, tell me! Finally, I'm going to ask guys, stop asking questions during sex. You're very inquisitive at a very weird times. And this guy, we're making love, and he was like, "Jackie, who fucks you like I do?" I was like, "Derrick, James, Jeff... "You're all the same." I'm Jackie Fabulous, guys. Thank you so much. -[ALL CHEERING] -[MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Move it like that ♪ Go, girl, go, girl Go, girl ♪ Get it, get it Go, girl, go, girl ♪ Go, girl, get it, get it ♪ Shake it like that Shake it like that ♪ Move it like that Move it like that ♪ Shake it like that Shake it like that Move it like that ♪
