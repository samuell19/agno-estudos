You can't smoke enough for that. Do something wrong? No, but women love flowers, always. Those aren't flowers. Women want roses. Nonsense! Other women maybe, but Hanni's just wild about thistles. Rather row than screw? You were sleeping. - So? Thanks. I thought you liked thistles. I wouldn't mind roses either. Red roses. That's what women want. Sorry, but I'm really running late. Maybe we could eai out this evening. Fish... I'd like that. You were asleep when I got back from papa's. - I was tired. What did you do? I was swimming. - Alone? Just me, really... and the 36 girls with little bikinis, and outstanding personalities. See you this evening. -1'lll evening... I can't wail. Gel up. Morning. Should I drive you? You can make the express. The local will do. So we slill have 20 minutes. Will you marry me? In May, OI' SOOHEI'. March, before Easier. This Easter massacre... The mhole year they pet the little creatures. Suddenly at Easter, they want t0 eat them. But we could fu... get married anyway, and then make a little Anna ora big... Little Ferdi better hurry 0r else he'll miss the big 'ol train and Ihen Anna can worry about her future. Morning, papa- Anna, theyre all outside already and Leni's not here yet. Can you Iell them not to eat the grapes? They're not ripe yet. The streets are still empty, but not for long. Pickets from the Transport Union, have set up blockades at all major intersections. Extra commutertrains will be running. As result of the transpon strike, extra trains are scheduled. Delays are to be expecled. In spite ofthis, have a nice day. Attention, the 7:13 does not stop a! this station. I really do like thistles more than roses. You're really sweet. I'll get us a table for this evening, ok? Sorry, busy day... How was it yesterday? Papa's just the same... There's a nurse, lvo's his name. He helps Alfonse. Saturday, we had fish. The food's always bad there, always breaded carp. I mean, in summer, who eats breaded carp? And Ihen to the cemetery to visit mama.And there, across the sireeLwe had to eat a sirudel, also a ritual with slight nausea, as usual, marvelous. And then a game show 0n... I'm looking forward to this evening, with you. - Me too. Maybe they'll have trout 0r perch. As long as it's not carp, not breaded anyway. It can be quite good baked. See you later. - See you, I can't wait. We regret to inform you, that due t0 excessive rail tratfic the Bela Bartok, Budapest-Paris is running 20 minutes late. I might be finished in 3 days. Don't forget to Iank before you come get me, regular. Oil is probably ok. You know, it's hard to put in reverse. And the brakes... The 242 local, scheduled for 6:42 is delayed 10 minutes. On track 1 is a freight train. This Irain will not slop. Please stand back! 242 local... Please board quickly to avoid funher delays. Hi, Leni. How was your weekend? So, so... - Papa's waking. Theyve been breathing heavy since sunup. They won'! choke. Who knows? They don't look too healthy. Just lake an express to the end ofthe line, doesn't matter where and then get out and look around. Orjusi slaythere and not come back. But the trains that stop here don't go anywhere you'd want t0 be. Papa's mad, and me too. We don't come over anymore, Mr Hudetz. Please stand back! This train does not stop. It can't be your fault. It must be because I don't lend the bar enough. Exactly! I don't tend the bar enough either. I was downsized. HMS “m? Since June there are only 1 1/2 of us: Me, and half of Schaflinger. That's why1f4 less 0f me at the bar and 1J4 less 0f me at home. Less a! home... What does Hanni say? We made a bet the other day, if she's celebrated her 50th yet. Not yet. Didn't celebrate it? Hanni she isn't 50 yet. Shit! I get the breakfast shift. Lost the bet. How much older is she anyway? Oh, I'm 90"'!- E142 at 7:13. This train does not stop. Nothing happened, or? Shit. How did it happen? Were many people on board? How many dead? 22 so far, up to 100 seriously injured. Was Joseph Schremserthe milk driver today? Joseph, yes. He died instantly. The engineer... loan'! imagine that Otto would overlook a signal. Hudetz Thomas, trafiic controller, Him melstal... Fine, I'm from the District Attorney. We needto... Was this a scheduled train? Was the train scheduled? The train hit without braking. He's the engineer. He's 11 years on the job. How many unscheduled trains were there today? Otto is always dependable. Mr. Hudetz... TM 1am, 11 unscheduled... Because of the street blockades, most were late. Also, the dispatches were ofien wrong but I didn't make any mistakes. I've done this 12 years. I acknowledged the signal, as soon as the E142 arrived right am?- Just like the engineer never missed a signal I've never... You smoke? That's Maxim. Killed his old lady, stabbed her. I've no idea about crimes ofpassion, must be pretty intense. He's Czech, that's all I mow. Doesn't say much, except in his sleep. And what are you doing here? Vacation? Hudetz... Thomas... lfsjusl an invesligaiion. It was an accident. It aM/ays is. The water must be calm today. I miss you. You know that we were never apart more than 2 days. Sure, you know. A little louder... Now we can't eat the carp. Did you freeze it? Fish should be frozen in milk, right? Thawed, fish should be thawed in milk, Alfonse says. No one ever got hun because of me. That must work in my favor. It was an accident. It's an accident when my clients die too. Mostly from heroin a little coke... I'll get 8 years. You could save the lives of22 people, iron out some things for me. Shut up you pig, I'll kill you! Shit! It's my own fault. If I'd gone on strike too, I'd slill be here. Shouldn't have had that beer. Now Ihey don't have to fire me, very efficient. 3 days afierthe disaster in Himmelstal 22 fatalities mostly Hungarian and French. The engineer of the Budapesl-Paris Express, and the milk truck driver, are among the dead. There are also 41 injured, some seriously... I really stepped in it this time. They hang around outside the Wrmle day, hiking, mediating, and not buying anything. Just great. Half oflhem sleep on the floor. Were you back out at the train? I'll do breakfast tomorrow. What's with you? Because of the bet. Hanni isn't 50 yet. Mr. Hudetz... I couldn't stand it anymore without you. Now you're here. At least till the first hearing. Do me up? You know, I could have died too. On Monday ifwe hadn't... If I'd taken the express then I'd be dead too. And what if it's my fault? All of il. I didn't mean it like that. You saved my life. Don't you know? But, I'm still here. That's what's imponanl. Se, and how was it in jail? It was crowded. Well, it's good to have you back. Two red wine please. I'll do it. I love you. I love you too. Good morning. So Thomas is out on bail. And you're back sooner than we thought. Let lvo do that, Papa's gotten used to him. Let's sit down. Make yourself a! home. Thanks. Ivo has wild mushrooms, maybe a little risotto? Ivo always makes it with cream, but I think at our age it's a little too rich. It's just too terrible. I aM/ays thought everything between you two was fine. So did I. The kiss, was it like with tongue and everything? Oh please. No. At least not a! the station... I don't know. You always had so much fun together. Please! It's Blaufrankish with 30% Merlot, 2003. Woody, but not too much. - He'd have had more fun with a younger one. More sports, children. - You didn't want any. I always thought he didn't want any. Well, Papa's much better now that lvo's here. Me m. I don't have to do everyihing myself. It's not so bad, a little washing, feeding, changing diapers. And forthree, the house is just ideal. There you go. I'll stay here for a while, OK? Who knows how long papa will be around and in the last 10 years I've seen him so little. And why now? 'Mm Gm“ do? I think a few days alone would do you good too, huh? I was alone, ljus1 got out ofjail, and might have to go back. I didn't put you there. - Me neither! Can I help you? No, thanks. Joe would be so happy. Come on. Leave me alone. So Anna... I swim for an hour almost every day. And... And what? What else? Ferdi sleeps here pretty ofien, huh? He's a nice boy. Yes. I'll swim a lillle more. I've got another 3 seminars booked. Maybe we can put some life in the place afier all. And if you and Ferdinand start the butcher shop we can offer snacks and dinner. Maybe you'd like that? They don't eat meat, no schnitzels, no roast pig. Our spare ribs Thursdays! Did you order the meal? Tom orrow, I'll do it tomorrow for sure. Ififs so much trouble why don't wejust close? How long can you still register for college? It's too late anyway end of September. Just leave me alone! Himmelsial: The investigation ofthe worst Irain wreck in 20 years begins today. The district aflorney hopes to discover the cause ofthe accident by questioning witnesses at the scene. What is known, is that the barrier had not been lowered when the milk truck crossed the {racks and was hit bythe train. If due to a mechanical failure or human error... I chatted shortly with Mr. Hudetz and then I heard the alarm. He reacted immediately How clearly did you witness it? I heard and saw everything. Paying attention Mr. Hudetz? Thank you. And Ihen everything was quiet again. Can you confirm this? Yes. I can't drive a train anymore. Streetcars... I just can't... Or the subway... Buses are ck, orlaxis. What is known is that the barrier was not lowered as the milk truck was hit bythe speeding train. The first hearings begin tomorrow. The cause of the accident has yet to be detennined. Eye witnesses and railway otfcials are expected to testify. Results of the investigation are eagerly awaited. Due to the transpon strike we added several extra trains. Of course there were many delays, not planned. I can only say that, from our side all changes were announced. In plenty oftime. You knowthat as spouse you are not obliged to teslify? I know. I returned t0 the station because I had forgotten my keys. I heard the announcement ONCE. And then, as I wamed to go in, I saw how that woman and my husband, embraced and kissed. And Ihen I heard the alarm. Why didn'! you say anything? Do I have to explain it? SONY, I'm sorry. Sorry you kissed her, or sorrythat I saw it? It was just a... Please, try t0 understand me. You don't let me understand you. I would have kept quiet, lied for us. One word from you and I'd have forgiven you. But you didn't give me the chance. That's the truth. Hold the truth. In 12 years I never made one mistake. You and your 12 years! And our 10 years? Were theythe mistake? How can I trust you? I worship you Hanni. Sorry Thomas, sorry. Hanni, please! After the local train lefi, was anyone else at the station? No I was all alone. As soon as Mr. Hudetz got the information about the train, he reacted. Before Ihai, or during that time, did you kiss Mr. Hudetz. We're good friends. We just greeted each other. Then he reacted immediately Except for us two, no one else was there. But now we've really done it. You did really well. It wasjust great the way you sat there. I was really proud of you. That scene that Hanni made. You just greeted each other, or? Tommy, he's almost like an older brother to you. Not guilty, congratulations. A chain 0f unfortunate events. Room service! I wanted to... Come on! What is this shit? It's all over! Her mother wasjust the same. Youjust have to ignore it. Afler a while everything will be ok. Women. Ignore them! That's why your mrife lives the last 15 years in Spain. IfAnna's not going to study, a! least she should help me out. It would do her good. They' re good, really. Come over here! Where have you been so long? Hows everyihing, 0K? Honestly Tommy, I wasn't a bit surprised by Hanni. Serves her right that you threw her out. Anna didn't like her either. I love you. I'm here now. Why? Monday evening: the choir, a few cakes, a litlle mineral water, lots of tea. Without the seminars it would be really dead and we'd be bankrupt. Tuesday is pretty quiet. Wednesday: the soccer team - beer. Thursday: spareribs - that runs great. Friday: teenagers - don't have money. Saturday: soccer but only when they win. And in between the hair dresser - prosecco, butjust when those sweaty brick layers are around. Our divorce will be in March, Hannelore doesn't want alimony. She claims irreconcilable differences. Probably another chain of unfonunate events. Ferdi wants to get married in March already. Up in SLAegyd a! the Romanesque chapel. And if it all works out he'll open a butcher shop, with me. Where the old breakfast room is with specialty items marinated stuff for barbecue in Summer, goose in the Fall, and rabbits and lamb in Spring. Breakfast injail was bread, jam, and cofiee. Lunch was soup, a little gooey, but edible Ihen chicken or pork with potatoes or rice, and evenings cold cuts and cucumber salad or cheese and tomato salad with onions- cut so small you couldn't pick them out. The crosses are where they found the bodies. Families torn apart, strangers close together. Imagine, the last thing you see is the neighbor you've been trying to ignore the last two hours and in spite 0f that, a shared moment afier all, a last one, in terror. And Maxim, he couldn't keep anything down. Something was always coming out of him. And you're living two meters away from him. It's like in a crowded sleeping car. When you turn away, you see the wall and when you hold your ears then il'sjust black. And he cried all night long and afier eating he puked even during the meal. I just saved my food for later and ate at night. His crying around wasn't exactly appetizing, but I had t0 eat sometime. Only Joe and the engineer didn't come together. But maybe they looked at each other. I didn't talk so much in a long time. I've no idea where to go from here. These things happen. Besides that, it's not your fault. Ferdinand loves you and you love him too. I wanted it too. N0, I didn't mean that. I was thinking about the dead. Do you want to blackmail me? I wake up and think of you, drink my cofiee and think of you, shave my legs and think ofyou, I see Ferdi and think ofyou. I love you. I don't know why. It's just so. What should I do? Maybe just wail until we've forgotten everything. I can't remember anything else. By the time you're married it will be ok. My mother always said that. But it's not true. I did 12 pigs and 9 calves today. Well, the calves had lime till tomorrow. But I thought I'd rather do them in the afternoon and then spend the evening with you at home. Doesn't the blood smell bother you? Doesn't bother you either, or? About that kiss... You greet everyone that way? All the men? All of them. Should we go upstairs or stay here. We didn't do it in the sauna for a long time. Today it's really not good. Oh, I see, till later then. There's no one here to forgive you. Unfortunately, they' re all dead. 15... Maybe 16... No, I remembervery well. When I was 15 the other guys were making dinyjokes and you didn't even look at my ass. I couldn't figure it out. They lost a child, lmre. He's on the other side, by Joe. On their headstone the name of ourvillage is misspelled. He must have run away but not far enough to another car maybe. He just wanted t0 play, maybe he was on the toilet. Can a four year old go to the toilet alone? I went to the toilet by myself a! two. I won'! many Ferdinand. I won'! be a bulchefs wife. I won'! eat any more spare ribs. Did you read the estimate forthe tiles yet? I'm waiting to hear from the plumber. The white ones are cheaper, but I thinkturquoise is better in the long run. Ijust can't stand to see blood on white tiles anymore. If we do the bathroom in turquoise too I'm sure we'll get them just as cheap as the white ones. Aren't you cold up there? Not at all. Keep going, please. What's the poini of all this? We are a mystery. That's the only reason. Vifithom our secrets we wouldn't exist, would we? Yes. Great, at least something works like it should. It's a scandal as far as I'm concerned. S0 4 days lost income at 5220... 208 euro and 80 cents. Sign here please. You're welcome. See you. 450 square meters... Irregular, -50%... It's just amazing, so cheap. Rust brown - great idea... You'll never see the blood not even dried blood. Come on! Afew are a little lighter. Seconds, that's why the 50% off. We can use them in the butcher shop. Look over here. First week of March a! the Justice's? And the week after that in the church. They're not angry anymore. - Yes. How was it? - Terrible. Anna, we killed them. 21 people from Hungary, France, everywhere, and they even paid me for it. They don't need us anymore. We don't need them anymore. Yes. Yes. No! Leave me alone. It's not too late. Leave me alone. Have a nice evening. Leave me alone! Suicide... No, Anna didn't kill herself. She never would have done that. I pushed her otflhe bridge. I killed her. I killed her and 21 people from all over Europe and Joseph. Wake up! You should wake up! Wake up you Pig! I can't kill someone in his sleep! Wake up!
