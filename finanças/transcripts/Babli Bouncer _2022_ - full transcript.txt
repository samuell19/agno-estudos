Kabir... do something! Do what? She broke my leg. If you had only listened... your legs would've remained intact. But you had to act cocky. Get it now? {\i1}On the outskirts of India's capital city, Delhi,{\i0} {\i1}are two neighbouring villages.{\i0} {\i1}Asola and Fatehpur Beri.{\i0} {\i1}Also known as the Village of Bouncers.{\i0} {\i1}You can look it up on the Internet.{\i0} {\i1}Every kid in this village knows that,{\i0} {\i1}to shape their future, they need to get their body in shape first.{\i0} {\i1}And not the usual kind.{\i0} {\i1}A body like a bodybuilder.{\i0} SRI TRILOCHAN GYMNASIUM {\i1}Then they can get a job as a bouncer in Delhi.{\i0} {\i1}It's a cool job.{\i0} {\i1}Every evening, the boys from this village{\i0} {\i1}hop on their motorcycles, looking dapper, and ride to Delhi.{\i0} {\i1}This story is of one such bodybuilder.{\i0} {\i1}Except it's not a boy...{\i0} {\i1}but a girl.{\i0} Hey, baby. You can tell me if the bundle's too heavy. I'll lift you in my arms and drop you home with the bundle. Isn't that right? What's wrong? Oh, Sheru... You have a dog's name, but you insist on acting like a donkey. You look so decent after the haircut. Will you look good carrying a bundle on your head? Since you're insisting so much, you can drop me home. I'm feeling pretty tired. Right... baby? Babli ma'am, we'll never trouble anyone again. Please spare us today. What a sudden change? From baby to ma'am? And only God can decide whether to let you go or not. Right, Bablu? Right, Pinku. Pinku, pick up that stone. Stone? Wet side up, you get a beating. Dry side up, we'll let you go. Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry. We're safe! We're safe! Hey. Celebrate all you want because you won't get this opportunity again. What are you doing? Untie me. Untie me. -This is all your fault. -Listen, I'm going home. My fault? You had to flirt with those girls. Babli, please untie me. -Untie me, Babli. -Untie me. Sixteen! Bravo. Bravo. Don't stop now. Chotu. Chotu. Chotu. Add more weights. Babli is coming. You're already doing 20. Lifting these weights is a breeze for me. -Add more weights. -Fine, fine. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. -She is here. -Careful, brother. -On the other side as well. -Careful. Let it rip. Hold it. Hold it. Kukku, you should lift as much weight as your body can handle. Otherwise, your back will arch like a bow. You embarrassed me. -I warned you. -Take the weights off. Basanto, I'm sorry I delayed your breakfast. But it's not my fault. Just like you were eager for your lunch, a few guys were eager for my punch. And I think of everyone. You know that. Come on, eat. You've made it a habit of coming home late. If you're done with your buffalo's interview Babli madam, go make some bread. For Golu. Your father and Golu will be home soon. They must be on their way. Coming, okay. Walk faster. Let your hands do the work, instead of your mouth, to make bread. Go to the kitchen. Can't even bake bread. Focus on your studies. Don't trouble your teachers. Which country's map is this? Looks better than your round face. It will eventually end up in your belly. So eat. She can twist words but can't shape bread. Eat. You're good for nothing, Babli. Says who? She lifts more weight than any bodybuilder in the gymnasium. What good is her bodybuilding to me? Uncle! Sweets for everyone. Need your blessings. What have you done this time? I got a job. At Delhi's Sarvodaya High School. -Bravo! -When? Just received their email. I have to join in two weeks. Hurrah, you did the impossible. Finishing college finally came in handy. We want a party now. Both these girls are made for each other. This one's going to Delhi, and that one is aiming for the moon. Aren't you two ashamed? All the other girls your age are married, and some of them are even pregnant. I wonder when you two will get married. Aunty, having kids is highly unlikely. In the city, women our age don't even get married. Late marriage is in fashion these days. And anyway, I want to work first. Babli... take a few more pieces of bread. After all, your friend got a job. It's all right, Mom. I'll take a second helping if I want. Pinku will share the food with me too. Won't you? I know who's going to eat all the food. Let her eat, will you? They are bodybuilders' daughters. You be quiet. Even a dozen slices won't make a difference. Isn't this great? You always gorge on food, and I'm the one who gains weight. Of course. Why should I do all the work? Gorge on the food and also put on weight? All the kids are going to call you "madam" now. That they will. Sis, don't become like that Drum. You had to take her name. By the way, you gave her an apt name. "Drum." Yeah, she looked like a drum and sounded like a drum. (X+Y)2 is equal to... Who will solve this equation? You? The girl sitting next to the window. Your name is Babli, right? Where's your focus? Busy eating all the time. Come on, solve this equation. You're teasing me, madam. X and Y are English letters. Ask me a math question and I'll answer. How did you make it to the 10th grade? Pinky's skills at studying and her skills at copying. Quiet! Was I cracking a joke? Always laughing unnecessarily. Hey, Drum fell down! Madam, how can you be so sure... that Babli threw those banana peels? Just like I'm sure she will fail the 10th grade this time. I don't care. In any case... we'll get her married in a couple of years. Marriage? Who will marry her? You're sounding so orthodox now. What's wrong with my daughter? She doesn't have a single feminine quality. Your eyesight is weak. Get a pair of glasses. Take a good look at my daughter. She has such a pretty face. From top to bottom, she's the epitome of femininity. God, your infamous burp. You moved on to the next class... while I kept failing for five years. By then I had had enough of 10th grade. Kukku bro, you're looking handsome today. -Am I? -I swear. Seems like it's your wedding and not the chief's son's. I spent three hours at the best salon. This is my opportunity to impress Babli. But I forgot to spray deodorant. Oh, damn. I'll go get it for you. -You will? -Of course. Hurry. Right away. Put on some lipstick. It will look nice on you. I don't want to wear a red lipstick. It leaves a mark everywhere. -At least untie your hair. -I don't want to. They get entangled. What the bugger? It's Drum! Hello. Hello. Congratulations. Congratulations. The Drum's become bigger. The Drum's fine, but who's the little tin can in tow? Hello, ma'am. -Hello. -Hello. These are my former students. -That's Pinky. -Hi. And that's Babli. Hi. This is my son. Recognise him? Viraj. He spent five years studying in London and returned six months ago. He now works for a big company in Delhi. That's amazing. -Thank you. -Those who focus on studies always have a bright future. Chitra madam. Yes, coming. That Drum still has an attitude. You guys call my mom ''Drum''? Sorry, it was a mistake. Relax, guys. Relax. I was just joking. Every student has a nickname for their teacher. Chill. Our Babli is funny. Yes, I am funny. I am very, very funny. See you, guys. HARYANA STATE TRANSPORT SIRHANPUR BUS STAND I wish even you had a job in Delhi. We could have lived together. It would've been so much fun. We've been together for too long. No jobs for me. I just want to get married and settle down. My, my... What brought on these sudden romantic feelings in you? Just like my burps, these romantic feelings are also coming naturally. I see. And with whom will you settle down? Viraj? Bless your black tongue. I pray that happens. And what about that Drum? Can you tolerate her? I won't have to. Now she will have to tolerate me. My time will come. Take her away. Are you serious? I'll get it fixed. What's wrong with the car? What the bugger! Your name may be Pinky, but your tongue is actually black. Please hurry up. Babli, what are you doing here? What's wrong with the car? The car's broken down, so I'm getting it repaired. How long will it take to get it fixed? At least a couple of hours. A couple of hours? You'll get a tan. The sun's pretty hot. Then you'll have to fix yourself as well. You are funny. I am very funny. Okay, listen. There is a restaurant close by. Their buttermilk is very sweet. Let's go get some. Thank you, but I don't drink buttermilk. That's all right. I'll have buttermilk, and you can have a cup of tea. Now quickly hop on. Hop on? Okay. Why don't you drink tea? Father says those who drink tea get dark circles under their eyes. Then no one will marry me. But I drink tea a lot, and I don't have dark circles. See for yourself. -Do I? -No. Then? Then what? I'll drink tea starting tomorrow. And anyway, Babli, marriage has nothing to do with someone's skin colour. People's frequency should match. The what now? I mean their thoughts should match. Yes, true. Do you merely want to settle down, or do you have any other plans in life? -No, I have other plans in life. -Really? A boy and a girl. That will be great. Father says, "A small family is a happy family." Fine, but don't you think it's more important for a person to be independent in life? Not just important, it's imperative. To be independent. Everything I said earlier is what I plan to do later. After I become independent. You get it? First, I will go to Delhi, like Pinky, and get a job. That's great. Nice. Good. So, if you're ever in Delhi, call me. Well... you didn't give me your phone number, so how will I call? I'm really sorry. Take it down, please. 9820... Ganga, Babli is home. Wait here. Your mom's coming. She looks so exhausted. So, I made this for you. Careful. I prepared this hot glass of milk for you with almonds. Drink up. What's wrong? Why is she showing so much affection today? A boy's shown interest -in ruining his own life. -Hey... He's coming to see you. Dad, I don't want to get married. Even I want to go to Delhi, like Pinky, and get a job. You spent 10th grade like India's Five-Year Plan and still couldn't clear it. And now she wants to take up a job in the city. You shut up. Look, Babli, what's the point of getting a job? He's a nice guy. He has shown interest in you. Meet him once. Yes. Finish the hot glass of milk. I've put almonds in it, just the way you like it. Like it? I'm sure you know how to cook. Don't worry. We'll hire a cook. You must like watching movies in the theatre. Don't worry. We'll catch a movie at home. I have a 52-inch-screen TV at home. We'll move it into our bedroom after the wedding. What... what are you doing? You should try it too. It's so satisfying. You haven't tasted the fritters yet. No, thank you, I don't like fritters. Don't worry. They are fried in pure butter. Even your burps will sound expensive. Something urgent just came up, and I've got to go. Just tell them you're with your future wife. No, that's not it. It's very urgent. Thank you very much. Hey, at least have a cup of tea. Okay, bye. I swear, Mom. I even said the fitters are of the best quality and offered them to him. But he ran away without trying any. Don't worry, sir. There's another guy who is a perfect match for Babli. He's a very decent guy. He owns a chemist shop in the neighbouring village. Shaukeen Chemist. He's from a well-to-do family. I can speak to them if you like. I need something for a headache. And for a backache. And a stomach ache as well. Why don't you just tell me what all you need? A pack of condoms, too. Mister, make that two. Which one? Whichever you think is the best. I don't know. I'm not married yet. Neither am I. Well, Mr. Hooda... it's all about destiny. If it's pre-destined, things fall into place. Right. Babli's here. Come, dear. That's Babli. Our daughter. Take it, son. Babli made it herself. It's fresh fruit juice. You too, mister. Babli knows every chore around the house. She's innocent like a lamb. Even Mannu is a straight shooter. Just like an arrow. That's a good thing. But not as sharp as one. Papa... Papa... She came to buy condoms at my shop. Mom... Mom. We need to discuss something. -We'll be right back. -At least eat something first. Come on, get up. Let's go. You should have done a background check. With him, we didn't even get to the snacks. It's not that, Babli. It's exactly that, Mom. If you force him to get married, then he'll either run away from the wedding or from his responsibilities after marriage. I'm fed up now. I don't want to see any more boys. Okay, okay. Let's wait. Babli... You're looking more dapper than the groom at the wedding. That's right. Slacking off on the job, Kukku? That's right. Do your job! Sorry, sir. Yes. Hello. Why did you put ice in my whiskey? I had said... no ice in my drink. Ma'am, you had clearly said you wanted ice. You mean Dolly Chadha is lying! You're the liar! And your father! And your whole family! Madam, you can't talk to me like this. "Madam, you can't talk to me like this." Why? Are you the Duke of England? -Get lost! -Madam, calm down. -What's wrong, madam? -Oh, my God. -He touched me. -No, no. He touched me. -He touched you. -No, no. -I'll file a case against you-- -Madam. I'll shut this club down right now, understood? -Madam, please-- -Dolly. Dolly. You're one of our regulars. Don't worry. Cool down. I'll order a new drink for you. Get a new drink for your mother's boyfriend! Look... Lower your finger! Come on, girls. Trying to teach Dolly Chadha. Damn jokers. Sir, she didn't pay the bill. Forget the bill. Thank God the headache's gone. This is their daily drama. Mr. Tyagi, these incidents have become frequent. Last week, some college girls created a stir, and today it was Dolly. Listen to me clearly. We cannot ban women from entering. Girls can come to our pub. They are our customers. Jaggii, you need to come up with a solution. I have a killer idea. Only a diamond will cut a diamond. Let's hire some female bouncers to handle the women. Female bouncers? What do you guys think? -He's right. -Great. -Jaggii sir is right. -Good idea. Okay, done. Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir. Kukku, bro! Kukku, bro. Kukku, bro. Kukku, bro. -What's wrong? -You'll be left dragging weights when Babli marries someone else. How can anyone else marry her? It's been my childhood dream to marry Babli. -Your dreams might never come true. -Why? Babli's been getting marriage proposals. -What nonsense? -Yes, I swear. Let's go. We didn't know before today how much Kukku likes Babli. Rathi, my buddy, as the saying goes, the most obvious things are hidden in plain sight. And this is perfect. Now my daughter will stay close by. Right, Ganga. You're absolutely right about that. And anyway, marriages are made in heaven. Just like a God and Goddess. I'll give this good news to Babli. -Of course. -Have some sweets until then. Please... So, what's up, Rathi? What? Kukku? You said all the boys in the village are my brothers. So, what changed now? You never treated him like your brother. Nowadays everyone is a "bro," but we don't take it literally. It doesn't make them siblings. You've turned blind in trying to get me married. I have also turned deaf. I can't hear a thing. I can only see... Kukku and you getting married. What's keeping the two of you? Coming! Come on. Let's go, come on. Kukku and his parents are also here. Other boys run away at the sight of you. But they came here on their own. You'd probably get me married to an ox if you could. Hello. Hello. {\i1}Your daughter's very beautiful.{\i0} I know. You've seen her grow up. White as milk. Try this. {\i1}Hello.{\i0} {\i1}How are you doing?{\i0} {\i1}Doing murder.{\i0} {\i1}Huh?{\i0} {\i1}Murdering mosquitoes.{\i0} {\i1}When are you coming to Delhi?{\i0} {\i1}Soon.{\i0} Kukku. Kukku. Babli. Wow! Your biceps are looking quite strong. That's right. And you have a decent job in Delhi as well. That's right. But girls need to become independent too, right? That's right. Exactly! I knew it. Whether anyone understands me or not, you will, my dear. "My dear"? -Me? -Of course. I'll have to be a bit formal with you... now that we're getting into a relationship. That's right. So, it's decided then. We'll get married later. First, I'll get a job in Delhi, like Pinky... for at least a year. What job? Pinky got her bachelor's degree, and you flunked high school. So did you! I mean, even you studied till eighth grade, but you still have a good job. I'm a bouncer. One needs brawn in my job, not brains. I'll find something similar to do. Inspired by you. That's right. That reminds me. There's an opening for a lady bouncer in my club. You can be a lady bouncer. Yes, of course. No, no. Why? It's a night job. Plus, it's in Delhi. Your father will never agree. I'm no longer his responsibility. Huh? Your decision is final for me. I know... my Kukku will convince my father for the sake of my happiness. That's right. -I will convince him. -Milk. Yes... Uncle, just say yes. It's a night job... in a city like Delhi. She's a young girl. I don't like this. Aunty... Don't worry, Mother. Babli is now my responsibility. I'll pick her up every day and also drop her home. Please, Mother, I'm there. I have a suggestion. Let her give the interview. We'll take it from there. What say? But, Dad, promise me. If I pass the interview, you'll let me work as a bouncer for at least a year and won't talk about my wedding. Okay, I promise. Happy? Babli, give the interview properly. Ms. Bobby is a bit of a grouch. She'll be taking the interview. Don't worry. We're from a village of bouncers. It runs in our blood. Listen, Babli. This... What's this for? Starting anything new on a sweet note brings good luck. All the best. Kukku, you're so sweet. That's right. Go on then. So, candidates, this is Ms. Bobby. She is going to select you for the bouncer's job. Why is your waist out of line from your body? Stand straight! All girls, attention! Shoulders tight. Listen, missy, why did you wear earrings? This interview is for a bouncer, not Miss Universe. Take the earrings off. Take it off! Girl, what's your name? Babli Tanwar. Father's name, Gajanan Tanwar. -Village-- -Enough! I asked your name, not your resume. Madam, my father also trains boys in the village, just like you. That's what I wanted to say. Like me? Your father? So you're a bodybuilder's daughter. That's why you're acting too smart. Okay, then. Let's see what you've got. Front and centre, come on. Come on. Do push-ups, right now. Do it now. One... two... three... four, five, six... seven... Twenty-seven, twenty-eight... Thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight. Sixty-five, sixty-eight... Sixty-eight, sixty-nine, seventy, seventy-one... Ninety-nine, hundred. Enough, enough, enough, Lady Hulk. Stop it. Stop. You really are a bodybuilder's daughter. Ms. Bobby, she is a killer. Shut up. Your training starts tomorrow. -Understood? -Yes, ma'am! {\i1}Louder!{\i0} -Shall we go? -Coming; give me one second. {\i1}I've been calling, but you're not picking up.{\i0} {\i1}Call me when you can.{\i0} Excuse me. One more. -Hello, sir! -Hello. -All good. -Absolutely. Super, mind-blowing. He seems loaded. Rs. 2,000 as a tip. Who is the rich guy? His name is Saurav Dutta. But we all call him Uncle. He's been a regular here since many years. He's a well-known businessman. He's rich but has no family. -I'll be right back. -Babli. Babli. Hi, Babli. I've been trying to call you for so long. But you seem to have disappeared. Sorry, I was out of town on business. I had poor network there. So, what's up? I'm in Delhi. I want to meet you. Wow, Delhi! How come? That's what I want to tell you. {\i1}Okay...{\i0} When can we meet? Let's have lunch on Sunday. Sure? Yes, sure. Done. Bye. Are you blind? Can't you see where you're going? Sorry, madam. It wasn't intentional. You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you! Just buzz off. Kukku, tell me something. What does "fuck you" mean? Where did you hear that? A girl I bumped into in the club said that to me. Babli, people in the city say that when they are angry. It means "naïve." Let's go. I see. Yes, Pinku. What about your plans to meet Viraj? What do I tell you? That Kukku never leaves me alone for a minute. How can I meet Viraj? You tell me. Then rack that devious brain of yours. Guess I'll have to do that, Pinku. -{\i1}Okay, bye.{\i0} -See ya. Oh... So, Babli's become a bouncer. Commutes to Delhi every day at odd hours with that Rathi's kid. Good God. Chief, what if the other girls get influenced by Babli and decide to roam around with boys on motorcycles. It will be disastrous. Look, Gajanan... you have three choices. Either you make your daughter quit her job. Or get her married to Rathi's kid, Kukku. And if there's nothing you can do, then send Babli to Delhi. We won't tolerate any of this here. Your daughter will be a bad influence on the girls in the village. You're a wise man. Let's go. What the chief said... is absolutely right. We cannot continue like this. I have made up my mind. Babli... you will move to Delhi. But where am I going to stay? You can stay with me. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Since everyone is insisting... fine. Here's your grand bedroom! Even the air of Delhi smells of Viraj. You're totally smitten, girl. Now, what's the plan? The plan is to meet Viru, that's all. Viru? Is that his nickname? If not, it will become soon. I am just waiting for Sunday to arrive. You're sounding like a modern-day Romeo, I swear. Babli, it's good to meet you in Delhi. Me too. Excuse me. What will you have? Some stuffed bread and a tall glass of buttermilk. They don't have that here. We have to order something else. Really? Such a big fancy restaurant and you don't have bread? Fine, then order whatever they have. Do one thing, get me one... Veg pizza and one edamame rice. Whose mummy? Edamame is soybean pods. -Kind of a fried rice. -Okay. -"Eda-ma-me" -That's all. Thank you. "Eda-ma-me"? -Edamame. -Yeah. You were going to tell me. Oh, yes, I got a job in Tally Gully. TG Club. The same place where Kukku works. I got a job as a lady bouncer. A lady bouncer! That is so fascinating. So, how did it all happen? I can't tell you how difficult the interview was. But I gave all the answers correctly. And nailed the physicals. I mean I did well. Madam got tired of counting, but I kept doing push-ups. Good. Very good. Very nice. It's here. Thank you. Please. Viraj, this is stuffed bread. We stuff the vegetables on the inside, and they sprinkled them on the top. You are funny. I am funny. I am very, very funny. Do you intend to clear your 10th grade? People study to get a job. I already got one. What's the point of finishing school? Then you can get a better job. You don't like this bouncer job, do you? No, no, it's not that. It's a nice job. Great. By the way, what else do you like? Hanging out with friends, watching movies. What about you? What do you like? You. I mean, I don't have time to spare like you. I spend all my time at the club. But now you'll have to make time... to come to the club. Yes, of course. I'll bring all my friends. When? In a few days. I'll wait for you. Can I taste some of your "mummy" rice? Why not? Let me know how it is... It's delicious. You don't have to bother. I can catch a bus home. It's okay. I'm heading in that direction. Hi, Nats. {\i1}How are you? How was your Singapore assignment?{\i0} Very well. The assignment was also pretty good. How are you? {\i1}How would I be without you?{\i0} Stop joking, and tell me why you called? {\i1}Are we meeting at the club tonight?{\i0} {\i1}The entire gang's waiting.{\i0} {\i1}We miss you, man.{\i0} Even I miss you all. -See you there. {\i1}-See you, darling.{\i0} -Bye-bye, take care. -You too. Girlfriend? No, just a friend. Wasn't she being pretty bold? She also called you "darling." Babli, that's how friends talk to each other in the city. See, we've arrived. Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Bye... darling. -Monika, watch your step. -I'm fine. I'm fine. Guys, hurry up, I am hungry. How are you, Babli? How are you? You can take the table at the back. Let's go for a smoke. Okay. Here. Tabassum, my stomach's acting up. Can you take my place outside, please? I want to be near the bathroom in case I need to rush. Okay. Take care. Viraj. Isn't that the bouncer we saw at the gate? Yes. She's from the same village where my mom's a teacher. -She's cute. -Cute? Babli, a drunk girl is creating a ruckus outside. She is going crazy. Go outside and control her. Yeah... -Go! -Yes! Tara! -You will fall down. -Don't touch me. I'm fine. She can't handle her. Come, madam, your car's over here. Come on, get inside. -Please get her in the cab. -Come on, get in. Behave yourself. Just leave me; I want to party. What the bugger... -Guddu, open the door. -Just leave me. I wanna go. I wanna party. Her father must be waiting for her at home. I don't wanna go. I want to party, man. Let's go. Too much you are. Shut up. -The ambience was good. -Yes. -And please get fit. -Yeah, yeah, don't worry. Viraj! Viraj! Viraj! Babli, what happened? You're leaving? Why didn't you tell me? I thought you were busy, and I have a hectic day at the office tomorrow. So I just left. Viraj, won't you introduce us to your friend from the village? Yes, of course. Guys, this is Babli. And, Babli, these are my friends. Neena, Natasha, Puneet and Romil. -Hi. -Hi, darling. Darling? -Hi, darling. -Hi. When will we meet again? Some other time. In fact, pretty soon. Come on, Viraj. Won't you invite Babli to your birthday? Yes, of course. Won't you invite her? It's your happy birthday? Yeah, the day after tomorrow. In fact, I was going to invite you, then I thought that you won't be able to attend. You have a night shift. How can I not come when you are insisting so much. That can never happen. Your shift? We'll shift the shift. And I can always get a stomach ache. She is so funny, dude. I am funny. I am very, very funny. Okay, see you. Guys, let's make a move. Okay. Bye, Babli. Bye. Happy birthday. It's his happy birthday! It's my buddy's birthday. It will be in London. And guess what? I am hosting it. Hey, that's great. All the delegates will be there. You should come. For sure, I will. Babli. Excuse me, guys. Good to see you. Happy birthday. Who gives these nowadays? You're saying that now. You would be sulking if I hadn't got it. Don't be shy. You can buy anything you like. Look who's here! Babli Bouncer in the house. Viraj. -Guys, you carry on. -Sure. You're looking nice, but don't you think this dress is better suited to a fancy-dress competition? Exactly my point, this dress is very fancy. So it is. -You're not drinking. Romi! -Yeah? -Get the lady a drink. -Okay. Here. Drink it. I don't drink alcohol. This isn't alcohol. It's champagne. -Should I drink it? -Drink it. Drink it. You're the bouncer from Tally Gully Club. That I am. Slow down. It's a celebration drink. I can drink a big glass of buttermilk in one go. So this is nothing. Can I get you another one? Yes. It's nice. Here you go. Can I get another one? -Another one? -Yes. Love you, bro. What a party, man! -Superb, superb. -What a party. And that bouncer of yours... she seems to be drunk, man. Better check on her. Yeah, yeah, don't worry. I will see to it. -See you, man. -You guys take care. -Good night. -Bye, bro, bye. There you are, Babli. It's pretty late. Don't you want to go home? First, we need to talk... then I'll leave. What is it now, Babli? A heart-to-heart chat. Let's do it some other time. You don't seem okay now. I've been this way since the day I saw you. Can't eat, can't drink. A girl who ate 12 pieces of bread is down to only six now. See... don't I look weak? You have no clue about the things I did to come to Delhi. Made my father's life hell. Got rid of two boys who came with marriage proposals. Even fooled Kukku. You like independent girls, right? See... I'm independent now. Standing on high heels. People in love get heartache, but even my ankles are aching. Babli, let's talk about this later. You should leave now. -I love you, Viru. -Babli, you are drunk. Let me call the cab. Why are you speaking so much English? Just say those three words and end it. And then fix the wedding date. -Give me the phone. -Babli! Babli, give me my phone. You make it sound like I have no right on you. Babli, please give me my phone. First, answer my question, Viru. You are talking rubbish in this drunken state. Have you lost your mind? You didn't think once before coming to Delhi whether I have any feelings for you. You just landed here. Babli, you work as a bouncer and don't even like it. And you call this being independent? You haven't completed high school and can't speak a word of English. You eat like a buffalo and burp in public. And you want me to marry you? What will I tell my friends? What will I tell society? That I was bitten by a rabid dog? Babli, of all the girls I know, you'll be the last one I would ever fall in love with. Got it? Come on, I'll drop you home. I came to Delhi on my own. I can go home on my own. Don't be stubborn, Babli. I'll drop you home. Babli. Fuck you. -What? -Fuck you! {\i1}You didn't think once before coming to Delhi{\i0} {\i1}whether I have any feelings for you.{\i0} {\i1}You just landed here.{\i0} {\i1}You haven't completed high school and can't speak a word of English.{\i0} {\i1}You eat like a buffalo and burp in public.{\i0} {\i1}And you want me to marry you?{\i0} {\i1}Babli, of all the girls I know,{\i0} {\i1}you'll be the last one{\i0} {\i1}I would ever fall in love with.{\i0} What's the matter, baby? Can we give you a lift? Just leave me alone, mister... and get lost. Madam, it's pretty late. Come sit in the middle. You won't feel cold either. I would've responded on any other day. But I'm in a bad mood today. So, thank your stars and leave. Don't get upset, madam. Give us a chance. I promise you we'll fix your mood. Rascal, now come fix my mood. Now tell me, you rascal. Stop. Stop. Sir, stop. Wait, you rascal... -Save us, sir. -Save us. -Save us, sir. -What's going on here? Save us. Save us, sir. We were only asking for directions. But, all of a sudden, she flew into a rage. How dare you lie, rascal? -Control her, Balwinder! -Sir, he's lying. -What is this ruckus? -Sir, he's lying. -Save us! -Quiet! Let's go. Take them to the police station. Everyone in the back. Put everyone in the back of the van. Listen to me. Be quiet! Quiet! Say what you have to at the police station. Be quiet. These boys are lying. I haven't done anything. -Arrest them. It's their fault. -Be quiet. Don't raise your voice in front of sir. Let's go. -Everyone makes mistakes. -You must have, too. -Listen to me. -You listen to me. Keep this... In the middle of the night... on the streets of a city like Delhi. If she roams alone, in a drunken stupor, she's definitely looking for trouble. It wasn't intentional. -She is just a young girl-- -She's not just a young girl! She is a bomb. An atom bomb. Look at the boys. She beat them to a pulp. They are so terrorised by her that they are afraid to look at the female constables. It's taken care of. Anyway... you seem to be from a decent family, so, this time, I'm letting you off with a warning. Next time, be careful. Of course. Let her go. Thank you very much, sir. Wait a minute. A piece of advice. Make her wear a pearl... on her small finger. It will help control her temper. Yes. My stomach's acting up. I'll just go to the bathroom. Whatever you did last night... you must have a valid reason for it. I know. So, I don't want to know anything about the violence, the booze, the arrest in what order they occurred or why. There is just one thing bothering me. My innocent child who liked drinking milk... has started drinking alcohol in the city. I made a huge mistake, Dad. I promise... I'll never drink again. This city doesn't suit you. Take my advice, come back home with me. Dad, you promised you'll let me work as a bouncer for a year. I haven't forgotten my promise. But everyone back home has begun asking. "When is Babli's wedding?" What am I going to tell them? You also promised you won't bring up my wedding for a year. You always said breaking a promise is a sin. Do I order more butter? Later. Eat your fill. Don't leave a single bite. Great. Father is pampering the daughter. I guess you two have made up. Yes, we have. -Do you have a problem with that? -Me? -No. -No? You take over. Yes. Are you all right, Babli? Did something happen? Kukku called in the morning, said you got arrested. Did anything happen at Viraj's birthday party? Will you say something? Let me sleep. My body needs rest. Babli, it's too early to go to the club. Where are you going in the afternoon? It's time to change some things in life, so I am going. What's wrong? Are you in shock? No, but I have finally learned my lesson. You shouldn't take such things to heart. We'll come up with a new idea to impress Viraj. I don't want to chase Viraj anymore. But tell me what's wrong. He showed me the mirror. And I hate the image I saw. I want that Babli to change. I have made up my mind. This whole episode has a silver lining. Go on, I'll see you later. And get some 10th-grade books on your way back from school. This time, Babli will clear high school. Hey, all you lovely people. I hope you had a lovely time tonight. This is your last track tonight. Enjoy! Have a blast! Pammi, I know these Rajouri Garden kitty party women very well. They'll buy their outfits from the local market and claim they bought them from a designer shop. Bloody frauds. Dolly, you are too good. I know how to expose these people. She's the Dolly Chadha because of whom we decided to hire lady bouncers for the club. Then I must thank her. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. Cheers! Babli, thank me too. Let's order another drink. Bill, please. We'll pay the bill later. First, get me a drink. Large. And listen, no ice. One for the road. Sorry, ma'am, the bar is closed. You know my name's Dolly Chadha. And this table is always reserved for me. Go, get me a drink. Yes, ma'am, I know, but-- Shove your "but" up your butthole. What? You're still standing here? Who do you think you're staring at? -You. -How dare you? Leave my hand. Leave me. Dolly, are you okay? Are you all right? You touched Dolly Chadha! You don't know my power! I'll shut down this club today! You may shut down the entire city. Take this drama someplace else. You and your girls... won't leave without paying the bill. Dolly, let us pay the bill. Bill. -Give the bill, -Yeah, we are giving. Just a minute. Sheep like to butt heads. But they forget... that they can run into a bull someday. Understood? Dolly Chadha. One more thing... thank you. Let's go, girls. This way, please. Are you okay? You're a killer. See. Nice. I had fun roaming the streets of Delhi with you on Friendship Day, Babli. I'll never forget this. It's the last Friendship Day of my life. Next year, we'll get married and, from a friend, you'll become my wife. Kukku, you're my best friend. That's right. You've always supported me. Me coming to Delhi, becoming a bouncer, the credit goes to you. That's right. But I want to tell you something today. What? I lied about wanting to marry you. What? I fell for Viraj at the chief's daughter's wedding. I know what you're going through. I felt the same thing when Viraj turned me down. But I've understood one thing. We can't decide who we end up falling for. In fact, we're both idiots, Kukku. But my fault was that I lied that I wanted to marry you. And for breaking your heart... I'm sorry. We both made mistakes, so let's just move on. Friends? Friends don't say sorry. Can I say something? And I won't apologise for it, Babli. Go ahead. Look... you'll be working for a couple of years. But someday you'll think about marriage. That day, will you consider me? Babli, I can still dream. What's it called? Hope. Will you have ice cream? Mister, two ice creams, please! Yes, sir. None for you? Mister! Okay, sir. Viraj, can I say something? I noticed at the club the other day Babli was completely ignoring you. What's up! Maybe what I said on my birthday upset her. Whatever the reason, she may be a country bumpkin, but she's not fake. Yes, I know Babli is a nice girl. It's just... she is not my type. Come on, let's go get some coffee. One more, please. Uncle, what's wrong? Uncle, come with me. Come on. Uncle, listen to me. Everything will be fine. We'll be at the hospital soon. Right, Jaggii? -We'll be there soon, won't we? -Yes, in no time. You are listening, right? This... This is exactly what happened with Bhuri. Who? Bhuri, my buffalo. All of a sudden, she fell unconscious one day. We were all very shocked. What was wrong with Bhuri? We didn't know what to do or not to do. The villagers then called the doctor. The doctor gave her a big injection. Nothing was wrong with Bhuri. It was just gas. Bhuri was completely fine. Yes, see... we've arrived at the hospital. Jaggii, park quickly. Come on, we've arrived at the hospital. Get the stretcher quickly! Take him to the ICU immediately. It's a good thing he's conscious. Otherwise, his situation could have turned critical. Don't worry, we will take care of him. Come on. Babli, you were amazing today. If you hadn't kept him awake, talking about your buffalo, he would've definitely lost consciousness. The next time Bhuri starts to lose consciousness, I'll tell her about Uncle. Scores settled. You know something. You're a killer. -Let's go. -Come on. You two should have informed me before coming to Delhi. -We did inform... -Pinky. Surprise. Surprise! What a perfectly round bread! Definitely not Babli's job. Must be Pinky. Mom, please look at those {\i1}rotis.{\i0} They are so fresh. As you can see, Pinky is sitting here. So it can't be made by her. Eat, eat quickly. Aunty, Babli now makes her bread round and fluffy. Just like me. Our trip to Delhi was a success. Why? Babli, hearing you speak such fluent English has overwhelmed me. We can go back home in the evening without worry. -Really? -Yes. -Kukku. -Yes, sir. Are you male bouncers upset that we employed female bouncers? Not at all. The boys are very happy. You see, boys can't do what girls can. The girls are doing a pretty good job handling problematic female customers. -It was really good. -Same here, man. I watched it last night. I really liked the first part. The second part was even better. How can he smoke here? With his mouth. It's so suffocating. Excuse me. Brother, you can't smoke here. It's a no-smoking area. Where does it say that? You know what? Go sit under the no-smoking sign. This is ridiculous. Viraj. Do you know who you're messing with? I'm MP Sikander Rana's son! Understood? Think of something new. The same old cliched line. Typical Delhi-- -Hey! -Viraj! Just let it go. -Viraj -What did you say? -Viraj. -Sir, please. -Viraj. -Sir, don't start a fight here. If you want to fight, take it outside. We won't tolerate this in the club! Viraj, let's go. Come, Jags. Sir, please. Calm down, Viraj sir. Please sit down. Relax, Viraj. Listen, take him outside. -Viraj... -So, where were we? Hey, No Smoking! What's this now? Hey... Viraj... Sorry. -Quiet! -Jags. I don't see a no-firing zone written anywhere on your body. Should I fire? Don't you know, man? You're so hung up on rules, but my father makes the law. If I squeeze the trigger now, you'll meet your maker. Understood? Hold your horses, bodybuilder. That thing could always misfire. It's hard to believe that a politician's son would lose his temper over such a small matter. Clearly, you don't care about your father's reputation. Never mind. Look all around you. There are CCTV cameras in every nook and corner. Within seconds, your video will go viral on social media. It won't take long for you to become breaking news on TV, and it will escalate to the Parliament. Your father can kiss his seat goodbye then. And you will go straight to jail. Jags, she's right. Now, listen. Keep the gun back in your pocket. Look at the camera, smile and wave. Take your friends, say good night and disappear. Everyone will think this is a prank. Am I right? Hey... hey, bro! It's just a little misunderstanding. Sorry, bro. It's all right. -How stupid. -Bye, guys, bye-bye. -Bye. -Bye-bye. Hello? Hello. Babli. It's Viraj. I recognise your voice. Which number are you calling from? It's my domestic help's number. You've blocked mine. Say what you have to say quickly. Babli, can we meet today in the evening? My shift starts in the evening. You can always call in sick. Babli doesn't make excuses anymore. How about lunch tomorrow? I have made plans for tomorrow with Pinku. What plans? How about the day after? I'll call you some other day. I'm cooking lunch right now. Hello? Hi, Babli. Please, can we talk? I would... but I'm getting late for my English class. I see! So that's why you've been so busy. Nice, nice. I'll give you a lift. I'll walk. I work all night, so I don't get time to exercise. Just hear me out. Please. Please. Babli. Babli, just hear me out, please. I'm getting late for the club. Babli! Babli! Babli! Sir, just one second. Please. Ma'am, please. Babli, you're not going anywhere now, are you? No. Just quickly say what you have to. Babli, of all the girls I know, you-- I know. I'm the last girl you would want to fall in love with. Please hear me out once. Please. Go on. Thank you. Babli, out of all the girls I know, you're the one I'd want to fall in love with! Did you get yourself injected? Injected? -Injected for what? -For dog bites. You said you'll fall in love with a girl like me if you get bitten by a rabid dog. You're trying to get back at me, aren't you? I know. So, you didn't get bitten by any dog. No, I didn't get bitten by any dog. I really want to get to know you better. I see. And what brought about this massive change of heart? It had to happen. You saved my life. You risked your life to save mine. I don't think anyone can love me so much. I would have done the exact same thing for anyone else. You don't love me, Babli? I don't. I was impressed by your personality just the way you are impressed by mine now. This is not love. It's called infatuation. No, Babli, that's not it. I really, really like-- So, you mean to say you like this Babli who hogs like a buffalo and who couldn't clear high school? Yes, I do. And my burps? Is it good to burp aloud in front of someone? What's good or bad about it? It's a natural way to release the extra air out of your stomach. And not just a burp... tomorrow you might hear other sounds too. Other sounds? Babli, you are very funny. You are very funny. Dude... this time, I'm not funny. I'm serious. It's not easy to love someone so much that you love everything about them. And if your love is not that strong, then it's not love at all. Right? I think this was a bit too deep for you. Relax. {\i1}Next station is Sector 56.{\i0} {\i1}Doors will open on the left.{\i0} One more thing. If you think I did you a favour by saving your life, then know that even you did me a favour. What favour? You opened my eyes. Babli's aim in life is not just getting married anymore. It's to become independent in this city. With heels or without heels. Babli! Uncle? What are you doing here? I was coming to meet you. Me? Anything special? Yes, of course. I wanted to thank you. You're the reason I'm completely fine today. Uncle, the credit goes to Bhuri. Who's Bhuri? My buffalo. I told you her story in the car. You love animals more than I have ever loved human beings. I spent my entire life making money, not relationships. If I had gotten married on time, I would have had a daughter your age. Uncle, I'm like your daughter too. My father always says that relationships are made with love, not blood. This is for you. -What is this? -Take a look. You're my daughter, so don't say no. -B. -B. Okay, Uncle. I'll accept this on everyone's behalf. Everyone? B for Babli, B for Bhuri... and B for Basanto. Now, who is Basanto? Bhuri's calf. Babli. God bless you, dear. Thank you, Uncle. See you. Hey, guys, India's number one Bollywood DJ... DJ Chetas in the house! -I'm going for a smoke. -Yeah, okay. Is that a joint? Wanna try? This is amazing. It's Afghani. By the way, my name is Sameer. Monika. By the way, Monika, I have some more superstar stuff. Here? In the parking lot. But I have a friend with me. We'll be quick, snort a few lines and be back. And then rock the party. Shall we? Okay. Wow, Monika, one more. Amazing. Have it, go on. Come on, one more. That's my friend calling. Have it, then we'll party. Madam, is there a problem? Yes, I can't find my friend. I tried calling her. It was ringing at first, but now it's switched off. I am loving this. -Come on! Come on! -What... Did you see a girl with a guy dressed in a leather jacket? Yeah, they went this way. -Get in. Where are you going? -Leave me! -What's happening? Help! -Start the car. Someone help me! Stop the car! I said stop the car! Someone help me! Robert, give me your bike quickly. Let me go! Just leave me! Sameer, I said stop the car! Sit tight. Help! Who's that blowing up the horn? Let me go! Let's see who this crazy person is, trying to mess with us. Pull over. Shut up! Someone help me! Who is this guy? Let's see. Help, help me. -Bro, it's a girl. -Help me, please! Today is our lucky day. One plus one, and it's not even a sale. Let's take care of her also. Come on. Come on. I had promised my father that I'll never beat up anyone again. I could've said this by breaking your arms. But, for now, I'm requesting you. Release the girl to me. You want the girl? Help! Take her. Let the girl go with her. Where are you off to? Don't move! Kabir... do something! Do what? She broke my leg. If only you had listened... your legs would've stayed intact. But you had to act cocky. Get it now? Where am I? You're in the hospital, my child. Who am I? Good God! Has Babli lost her memory? Hit Babli on the head in the same spot. It can bring her memory back. I'm sure. I've seen it in old Hindi movies. I'll hit you on the head. Nothing is wrong with me. I was only joking. Babli! Do you think this is funny? I almost fainted. Careful. I'm going to faint of hunger. Dad, pass me that fruit. -Here. -The basket. One is never enough for you. Eat it. Eat properly. Babli Bouncer is on TV. {\i1}-BABLI BOUNCER'S AMAZING FEAT{\i0} {\i1}-Calm down.
