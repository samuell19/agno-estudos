That old engineer loses more steam than he gets in the cylinder. He can't even pack a bearing. I had to do it myself. What are you doing, still juggling those figures? I'm not juggling. Have a look. We'll made about $800 this time. Is that all for all the work we did? I'm going daffy plying freight up and down this river. Dan, let's sell the Betsy and get into something else. Well, $800 may not be much, but it's safe and sure. Yeah, yeah. At least we had some excitement when we owned the old Hatty T. Wasn't it your idea to swap her for this? Yeah, but the whole setup has changed. There was a war on. A man could make some real money, or don't you remember? Oh, I remember all right. I remember getting a broadside amidships from the Union gunboat, picking splinters out of my, um, hide for two weeks. We got $100 for every splinter. That's right, in Confederate money. That war's over, Pax. We can't start another one just because you're restless. Me, I like the river, always so peaceful and quiet. Hey, Augustin, all these nice, tender cows, you must treat them tender. Why those cows are not across the river, huh? Those ranchers, they catch us, they will hang us by the neck until we don't lives no more. We got no time to die now, eh? Avast that, Runty. Let it be. Nobody cares what time it is around here, except maybe the [inaudible]. Well, I care because it's regulation, and if you'd ever sailed before the mast, you know it. You [inaudible] on that. I've sailed the Davis Strait. I've picked whole whales from to Madagascar. Now, stay away. I think I'll scuttle you. No, don't. Sailaway is off his course. Now, you undersized jellyfish, repeat after me. I'll never speak no more foul slander against my friend. He and that Runty are up there fighting again. Hey, Sailaway. Runty? Go on. But... but Sailaway, we... we don't have to... Come on. Speak. Off the port bow, a school of sea cows, look. You ain't getting out of this. Say it. Look, sea cows. You say it. You floating landlubber, don't you know better than to block a channel? Sailaway, can't you miss a sandbar, even in broad daylight? But it wasn't his fault. Hey, Skipper, I've navigated the reefs of people Nuku Hiva in a typhoon. I've sailed the shoals of... Never mind that. Why'd you run aground? Oh, them multi-horned sea lions pushed me here. You'll need a better excuse than that if you can't get her off. Full speed astern. - Aye aye, sir. - Full speed a... Full speed astern. [inaudible], you up there, I think maybe you boys are stuck good good, eh? That man at the wheel should stay awake when the river, she bend. You blubbering knuckle joint. I'm sorry my friend, but I don't like the haircut with old harpoon. Shut her off, Runty. Now that you've shown us your fancy shooting, how about getting us off this sandbar? You got us on. Maybe we do business. I come aboard. I got an idea he's got a funny notion about business. The Fremont bottom, 30 years of floating, I'm winding up high and dry on a Texas sand dune. You must have done your floating in the bathtub. I'll float you. Dominique Andre [inaudible], at your service. Huh, that's quiet a collection of handles. That is a custom in my Louisiana. And yours? I'm Paxton Bryce. This is Dan Taylor, my partner. Good. What's your deal? Well, I am in quick hurry. You carry my cows, and, uh, I will pull it off your boat. Somebody after you, huh? Looks like they're rustlers. Ah, the big, old fashion, the wars here make enough cows for us all. What's the war got to do with it? Everything, the owners, they go away to fight. They stay for years, and these cattle travel all over Texas by himself and make plenty of little ones. These are what people in French are..., like English, free like deer. They belong to know one. They got no brand. And, uh, finders is keepers, huh? Oh, I have a soft heart. I ask myself, uh, Dominique, these poor cattle, they don't got no home. So I gather them together like they come to live on my home. That's very kind of you. Why are you such a hurry? Well, these ranchers, they want to keep all the wild cattle, so they chase me. Upon this sense, I am telling you the truth. Well, that's good enough for me. What do you say, Dan? I guess it's all right if the Betsy Ann gets paid for what she carries. Oh, I am honest man. I wish to go to Millio Landing on the Louisiana side. How many cows you got? About $1,000. Cost you a dollar a head. I will get my men started, huh? Tie a rope to the back of the boat. Ferrying cattle, it's plum degrading, Runty. Could have been goats. Hey, Dominique, I'd like to hear some more about those poor orphaned cows. And those cattle are worth a lot of money. All the Frenchman had to do was pick 'em up. What's the matter, Jim, the bearing again? No, sir, but I just laid eyes on who we're carrying. That's Dominique Beauchard, the fella that raided Parkfield. Beauchard? Why, he's the one that's turned this end of Texas into a shooting gallery. Get below, Jim. We may need a full head of steam. We better get our money quick. Well, how about our money, fare? Oh, I pay later when I get the money for the cows. Pay now, or you don't take 'em off, Beauchard. Oh, Beauchard, so you know me, huh? That is of no consequence. Boy, close the cargo part. I say I pay later. Pierre, get those cows off quick, and keep your eyes on les Americaine. Billy, Henry, get the cattle off the boat, quick. Full speed ahead. Full speed ahead. Hey, ya [inaudible], why didn't you tell me something I don't know? Beauchard, your cows just about pay for our troubles. And we never give credit. I still owe you something, but I always pay. Well, it looks like we're in the cattle business. I'd sooner he'd handed us the money, though. He handed us an idea that's worth millions. We're way ahead. This whole end of Texas is full of cattle that don't belong to anybody, natural increase during the war. If we buy the land, all the cattle on it are ours. Sounds like a great idea. It's too much of a gamble, though. Gamble? So was running the blockade, but we made money, didn't we? Can't you see it, Dan? This beats any deal we've ever been in. We can take the money we've got, sell these cattle and the Betsy Ann. We can buy land by the square mile, round up cattle by the thousands, sell them and buy more land. We'll have a ranch like nobody's ever seen before. It would be like owning your own country, wouldn't it? It'll be bigger than that. It'll be like a... like an empire, our own American empire. When you're flying high, well, I'll flap along with you. We'll get to Riverford. We'll go have a talk with a land agent, then I, uh, think we ought to drink a couple of toasts to a mighty bright future, don't you? Worse than a Nantucket sleigh ride. I I'll put the law on you. Oh, where's my customer, my customer? Hello, little fella, what a place to roost, you're the prettiest prize I ever got in a grab bag. Is there any more in there like you? Isn't one victim enough, or do you generally run them down by the dozen? Let go of my hat. You ain't hurt none? I'll live. Hey, you bust a seam, Skipper? Not a one. Not a one. Get out of here. Get out of here. This ain't no corral. And you, mister, it will cost you a lot of money for this damage. All right, it'll cost me a lot of money. Here you are. Take that and keep the change. All right, boys, show's all over. I'll see you down in the music hall. Hey, you got a wonderful door here. Go ahead. Trample my luggage, too. I'm sorry, ma'am. Honest, I am. I mean, about the whole thing. You ought to be sorry, a grown man playing horseback on a cow. I ought to call the police. You'll have to call awful loud because we're not blessed with them out here. That's too bad. You belong in jail. Missy, your tacking way off your course 'cause he's the finest little skipper that ever tripped around the deck. Thank you, Runty. My compliments, ma'am, to cool you off. Little lady, my compliments, to hold in your temper. And may I compliment also? I've never seen finer specimens of drunken hoodlums. Ooh, is she upset or something? Now, I've shivered and froze over half the Arctic Circle, hunting these here whale bones so women could hold up their reputations. And what thanks do I get? Reminds me of the Hatty T... got the lines of a clipper and the disposition of a blocky barge. I sure hope we don't sight her again. Let's go back where we came from. Hey, Dan, ho, Dan, what in the Sam hill? Where are you? What... what happened? I thought you were gonna meet me after you got tied up. Well, something happened that kept me onboard. Oh, did you miss the time? Yeah, sure, I guess you did the honors for both of us, huh? You better sleep it off. Oh, I don't want to go to bed. We're going back to the music hall, and wait till you see the red head that I got lined up for you. Well, we'll make it some other night. What's the matter with you? Didn't... didn't you hear me? I said a red head. She's even prettier than the one you sent them violets to in Galveston. I didn't have a girl in Galvestone. It must've been Sailaway. Sailaway my eye, it was you she through the lamp at. This was even... What else did the red head do? What's she doing here? You know we don't allow women onboard. She's no woman. This is my kid sister, Abigail. Abby, this is Paxton Bryce. She arrived this afternoon, had a kind of an accident with a no-account drunk. Well, what's so funny? I was the accident. Well, she said that it was a low-down, no-good rowdy. I should have recognized you, Pax. Well, I've furnished so much amusement. How did she happen to cruise in? Did you send for her? Well, not exactly, that is I might have mentioned in one of my letters that we had a lot of room onboard. Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, and you also told her we're gonna make a stop at Riverford. Holy smokes, Dan, we haven't got time to be a couple of nursemaids. Now, listen, Pepperpot, I did send for her. We probably hurt her feelings. That's too bad, but she can't stay. Poor kid, she's probably crying her eyes out. A fine reception we gave her. This country is no place for her. It's gonna have to be. My aunt that she's been living with died, and naturally, she feels that her place is with me now. I'm very sorry, but our plans don't include kid sisters. She's going back east. Give her any excuse you like, but you gotta get rid of her. Nothing doing, now it's up to me to look after her, and she stays. Look, Dan, you know how bossy women are. Before you know it, she'll be telling us what to do. She'll have the whole place upside down. Well, if that's all that's worrying you, forget it. You won't even know that she's around, and I... I promise you won't. All right, see that I don't. I suppose I'll have to stand for some of these changes around here, but the Hatty T stays right there. Sorry, I was just gonna put up something I like better. Well, maybe your brother doesn't mind if you make a parlor out of this cabin, but I'd appreciate it if you let my things alone. And where are the old curtains? I like them. Those are the old curtains. I just washed them. Would you mind telling me where my pipes are? Here they are. I washed them for you. You what? Oh, don't get so excited. It's only soap and water. Only soap and wa... oh, my... and with my shaving brush. So I wasn't even going to know she was onboard, and in the last two weeks she's overhauled everything but the engine. Oh, simmer down, Pax. Personally, I like the way she's fixing things, and don't forget the good meals she's been cooking. Yeah, all the comforts of home. Well, I've had enough. I'm going ashore to look at that acreage. Hey, the land agent said it make a good starter for the ranch. Well, I'll go with you. I'd better get a couple of cans of beans. Why? Abby's cooking a nice rabbit stew. Hey, Sailaway, heave to and tie up to the west bank. Sailaway, you and Runty stay behind and give Miss Abby a hand. This tub is turning into a cruddy, old hen house. Splice me for a one-eyed eel. I ain't no cabin boy, Mr. Taylor. Of course, you aren't, Sailaway. And I'll handle the rest till we take a look at Mr. Bryce's property. It isn't every day that you can catch a glimpse of an empire, is it? No, ma'am. Are we ready? There's the boundary marker. Now, way up in those rolling hills is another marker, and everything in between is the... Is the Bryce Empire? And is that the cattle that come with it? All right, Runty, man your station. We'll put the little critter in drydock. I'll take the bow. You take the stern. Mr. Bryce! Mr. Bryce! Look. Oh, it doesn't look bad at that. There are a lot of things to consider, Pax. We don't know anything about the cattle business. We can learn, can't we? Look at that. When I see that, there's only one thing I can think of. How much land can I get, and how many cows go with it? You're letting your imagination run away with you as usual. If it wasn't for my imagination, we wouldn't have a nickel. Why, we wouldn't have run cotton, and we wouldn't have... Well, this time, you're wrong. I think, Dan, that... Now, I know you had to come along. Please, don't bother thinking. I was just going to agree with you, Mr. Bryce. Oh. Oh, you were? Well, that's a little different. Then neither of you are using any common sense. Who's gonna buy beef from us in these parts when they can get it for nothing? They won't here, but they will up north and back east. They're paying $10 a head in Abilene, and that fella, Chism, proved that cattle can make the trip. Yeah, it's a point, but why throw away money buying and when you can round up all the cattle you want? Oh, it won't always be like that. Someday, all this land will be privately owned. Of course, it will, Dan. The country is growing this way, and before long, there will be a new way of living, law and order and property rights. There will be no place for wild cattle hunters. You'll have to have your own range, and a lot of it. Well, Dan, we're, uh, two to one against you. So you two are pulling together for a change? Well, I know when I'm licked. We'll sell the Betsy Ann to that fella in Riverford. Well, Abby, I, uh, guess I was a little bit wrong about you. It's, uh, getting to be a pleasure having you around here. That's the first nice thing you've said to me. You better be careful. It might get to be a habit. You couldn't be. A habit is, uh, something you're not conscious of. Like that awful frown when you're mad? Well, that's, uh, self defense. Begging your pardon, Skipper, what are we gonna do now? You can swap that harpoon for a branding iron. We're going to work. A harpoon on dry land, why, that's plum loony. I'm gonna get me a buffalo for a pin cushion. I'll cleave him clean in two at 100 yards. Sailaway, you're gonna make a valuable man on a cattle ranch, the way you can throw the bull. I hope it's as good as it looks, Abby. It better be. I put eight eggs in it. Eight eggs in one cake? The Bryce and Taylor Ranch must be doing all right. Boy, that's pretty now. Why don't you let it burn a little while? I don't know. Happy birthday, sis. Happy birthday, Abby. And to the first anniversary of the Bryce-Taylor Ranch. We have to drink to that. Are you gonna cut the cake right away? Sure, we want to eat it. How about it, boys? Should we wait for the cake, or should do it now? No. Right now? All right, Abby... We're, uh, all mighty pleased at the way you stuck by us through a pretty tough year. And since this is your birthday, we, uh, want to give you these. Oh, gee, I don't know how to thank you all. Come on. Open 'em up. Let's see what it is. From Sailaway and Runty. Oh, look. That nice? Oh, it's lovely. Oh, of course, you don't have to... Didn't you like it? Sure. Because you're twice as big, you get kissed twice. Gosh, I wish I was as big as an elephant. Well, ain't ya? Well, uh, open up the other one. Oh, Pax, it's beautiful. Gosh, a pair of laced chaps. I didn't buy 'em. The sales lady must have put 'em in. I'll put the dress away so it won't get wrinkled. How about a little song, huh, Runty? Yeah, yeah. Come on, a little song. Come on, boys. You better stop that gal, and she's got him earmarked. Earmarked? That lass has got him roped and hogtied. She sure has. Oh, Pax, it's the loveliest present of all, oh. It's all just beginning, Abby. There isn't anything the future won't give you. All I want and need is right here with me now. Oh, Pax, we'll build something fine together, something we can be proud of. We can be married before I go to Abilene. Oh, and this will make such a lovely wedding dress. Certainly, what do you think I got it for? Pretty sure of me, weren't you? I never heard of such conceit. Well, I... If it's just a question of you, I could say, no, but I don't see how I can resist the dress. Give me some time to blow the man down. Oh, it's sailors and tinkers and tailors as men. Hey, hey, blow the man down. Have I but known, I would have arrived sooner for our celebration. What do you want, payment for your cattle? Oh, no, monsieur, but you plenty of cattle now, eh? Yes, and plenty, but they're all ours. Oui, oui, ours, eh? Not yours, ours. The old score is all settled. Absolutely, Dominique Beauchard always start clean with his new partners, eh? Well, why do you laugh? It was my idea to go into business. My idea, your money, yeah, we are partners, no? No. You don't have enough claim, not even for a single hoof or horn. Yeah, but I have a different view. Listen, Beauchard, if we catch you or anybody else taking any of our cattle, I'll give you a dose of stomach pills you can't digest. Do we understand each other? Hey, I know how you feel, but I, too, have ideas like yours. I would like a big ranch in my Louisiana where I can be a big man of much power. That's your affair. But when you're on this side of the river, you keep your eyes peeled for our boundary markers. Oh, I have seen them, but, uh, I don't believe little words on paper. He wasn't bluffing. We can take care of him, all right. Think you ought to put off the drive to Abeline? Not by a jug full, we need all the money those cattle will bring. You'll have enough men to take care of Beauchard. I'd relish doing it for a fact. Come on, Runty, let's finish the song. Yeah, come on. Oh, sailors as tinkers and tailors as men, oh, ho, blow the man down. Well, go on, Paxton. - Good luck. - Thanks, Dan, so long. Bye, Ms. Bryce. Take care of yourself, Sailaway. Yeah, Sailaway, take good care of my husband. Likely as not, he'll take care of me, ma'am. Well, come on, Runty. Promise you'll be careful, darling. It's such a dangerous trip. And if anything happened to you, I... Nothing will, not when I have you waiting for me. I'll be back by Thanksgiving. Goodbye, Abby. Goodbye. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come back here, you buzzard. No use in running! You're gonna roost in my oven. Come back here, you buzzard. Hello, Willa May. Hello, Willa May. Oh, hi, [inaudible]. Everything all right? Well, I know we'll have a real Thanksgiving, sure enough. How about a piece of that good old apple pie? Pie is waiting. But don't you mess up my kitchen 'cause you know I know you cowboys. Oh. Oh, Pax, I'm so glad you're home. Not any gladder than I am. I got you a little thing. I sold the cattle, and then I went right out and bought you the finest present they had in Abeline. Bring it in, Saillaway. Wait till you see it. We missed you, Sailaway. Nothing like home port, ma'am. Where you want it? Put it right there. Just the only one in the world, I had it made special. Well, there she be, with not a scratch on her hull. You like it, honey? Like it? Oh, it's fit for a king. That's what he'll be someday. Oh, Abby, he's going to make our future complete, something to build for. What's the matter? Lately, I haven't been so sure of our future. I've been worried, Pax. You'll get those notions right out of your head. We'll have the best doctor that mo... Oh, it isn't that. It's Dan and the ranch. Beauchard's been raiding us ever since you left. Why didn't you tell me in your letters? I'd have come right back. Dan thought he could catch him, but he's managed to slip away every time. I guess I didn't take that hombre seriously enough. Where's Dan now? He's gone to Blue Rock Canyon. He put some cattle there to drop Beauchard. Oh, Pax, I'm afraid. Dan may be walking into a trap, himself. Beauchard seems to know ev... If you don't stop that fretting, you won't have any appetite for that turkey dinner. I'll go give Dan a hand. Runty, hold it. Wait till they start moving the herd. Augustin, you are a wise old fox to find so many cow in one place. For that, I am going to promise you one hundred gold piece, eh? What's wrong, Dominique? Hey, now I know why there are so many cow where the glass is so poor. I smell a [inaudible]. This place is no good, and we must go. All right, fellas. Hi, Pax. Hi, Mr. Bryce. Hello, boys, how are ya? Well, you missed quite a ruckus. Yeah? I finally got Beauchard. He wound up in the river. That's the best day's work you ever did. I don't want any trouble for the next few months on account of Abby. That's right. How'd things go in Abeline? Got top prices. Good. You are hurt, huh? My friend, they give me something I will not forget too soon. Ah, oui. Take it easy, Pax. Abby will be all right. Hey, that squeal's pretty high. It must be a girl. It's gotta be a boy. I made him a harpoon. Is she all right, Willa May? She's fine, so is your son. Whoo... Shh, y'all be quiet. Come on. The cigars are on me. Help yourself, boys. Oh, thanks. How's it feel to be Pop? I don't know. Uncle Dan? That's right. Lucky it wasn't a girl, Skipper. We'd have had a tough time raising her. Oh, what do you know about raising kids? Everything, I was the last in a 14-kid family, and I never did get enough to eat. And good thing you didn't. Let me tell you some of the troubles I had when I was a kid. And that, my mates, is how come I had the measles 14 times. How many times? 14. Go on in, Pax, and meet your new boss. I can't tell you how much I love you. He's beautiful, Pax. He has your eyes. Husky little shaver, isn't he? Yes, sir, awful lucky, [inaudible]. Pax, Jr., for every one of those pounds, I'll get you 10,000 acres. And for every year after that, I'll double it. Hold it this way, two fingers. Now, keep the elbow stiff. Put your weight on your right foot, and bend your knees. That she blows. No, no, Pax, get some heft into it. But you I could rope it. Ah, what kind of sailing talk is that? Aw, gee, Sailaway, I don't want to be a whaler. I'm a cowboy. Listen here, young feller, whaling is a noble profession, and you're gonna be the great whaler... Not if I have anything to say. Good morning, Pop. I got up extra early for our ride, but you'd gone, though. I went into town to get something for you. My pony? Where is it? Runty's on him. Oh. Sailaway, I don't like to be at you all the time, but you've got to stop spouting that kind of talk to Paxton. Well, blast my barnacles, Mr. Bryce. I hate to see the lad grow into a landlubber. He's not going to be foot-loose wind jammer. He's going to grow up to be a solid, dependable man that the whole country can look up to. Aye aye, sir, but I still say he ain't cut out for no cowpoke. Mom, Mom, look, my very own pony. He's great, isn't he, Mom? Oh, I'm glad you like it. You haven't even noticed the saddle. Oh, it's wonderful and just my size, thanks, and a real lariat. Yeah, made it special for you. You did? Thanks, Runty. Is it what you ordered, son? Oh, you're the best pop in the word, and you're the best mom. Well, up we go. How are the stirrups? They're just right, yahoo. You'll be out-riding me in no time. Patch is awful smart, Pop. She handles easier than a smoke in a fair breeze. I wish you wouldn't pay quite as much attention to Sailaway's yarns, son. Oh, I listen 'cause I like him. Can I go on the next round up? Oh, that might be a good idea. It's about time you learned how a ranch is run. You just keep your eyes open and watch everything I do because someday you're gonna be the boss. Am I? If I watch you, will be a real cattleman? Pax, raising cattle is a mighty big job. It's probably the biggest job in the United States. You know, once Abraham Lincoln said, we must get beef to all the country, both North and South. He was talking to cattlemen like you and me. He left us with that responsibility, so we'll have to live up to it. Golly, if we're gonna feed everybody, we'll have to round up a lot of steers. Lucky I got my new lariat. I rope calves and help ride herds. We can always use a good hand, son. Now, I guess we better get home. Want to race? All right, come on. At the end of the trail, little pal, when the sun disappears in the west, at the end of the trail, little pal, we will have real contentment and rest. If we should be parted by some trick of fate, wait at the old corral. Why don't you all go to work? You know you may depend that you'll find me, old friend, at the end of the trail, little pal. These figures are impossible, 3,000 had less than last year. Every year, your tallies have been off, more each time. Well, I can vouch for the figures. We've combed every inch of the range. Yeah, I thought at first it was drought, freezing, normal strain when you consider the size of the herds we're handling, but 3,000 head is too much of a leak. I don't like the look of it, myself. Pop, will you fix my lariat? Not now, Pax, I'm busy. There's only one answer for it. Other ranchers are driving our cattle to market alongside of their own and burning out our brands. There's a sure way to stop it. Close the range to everybody. That'll cause a peck of trouble, Mr. Bryce. Folks have always driven across each other's land. They're not going across mine anymore. Post no trespassing signs, and patrol the range to make sure everybody understands we mean it. Don't you think we better wait till Mr. Taylor gets back from Galveston? I gave you your orders, Ford. Pop, are Mr. Crowder and his friends our cattle? Somebody is, and we're gonna put a stop to it. Ah, Pierre, the journey was good, eh? Oh, good 1,000 times, such fat cows. I should thank Monsieur Bryce and Taylor for raising them for me, huh? Yeah, also the saints that they don't find out it is you who take them all these years. Yeah, but you forget. I am a ghost. Was I not drowned? Hey, something happened while you was away. Oui? Oui, I buy the Lamir Plantation at St. Croix. You bought... Oui, oui. Well, soon, you will be the most rich man in Louisiana. Well, the most rich and the most powerful, heh? Well, can I help it if my good partners are so careless with their cows, hmm? Well, no, no. - Howdy, Mr. Taylor. - Howdy. How are you doing, Mr. Taylor? Hi, boys, glad to see you all again. Well, thank you. Why are the artillery? No outside herds allowed on the range, Mr. Bryce's orders. Some of the outfits are kinda hot, but so far they're just calling names. They you are. Now, it'll run free without grabbing. Thanks, Pop. Pax, what are you thinking of, closing the ranch to outside cattle? Well, you know all Texas is open range. Well, it's about time it wasn't. A man can't raise a decent herd with every scrub bull mixing with this stock. He puts out feed. Another man's cattle eats it. You can't even run steers on your own land. Somebody grabs 'em. Just the same, you can't go around stepping on folks. Well, let 'em keep out of my way. Pax, you don't have to push people against the wall. Well, if you make those ranchers drive the long way to market, there won't be any meat left on their cattle to sell. You'll force 'em out of business. This country was made for men that can stand on their own feet. If you want to survive, you have to fight. You can't be a sentimentalist. And you can't play lord and master. You forget it took the little man as well as the big one to make this country what it is. I can do without your lecture. You've gotten so puffed up with your own importance... Dan, please don't quarrel. I won't, Abby. Have it your own way, but remember. You can only push 'em so far. Pax, what's happened to you? You've changed so. You're hard and greedy. Hard and greedy because I'm fighting to keep what I have for my family? I'll see them in... Pop, why? Is it because you're turning people off our place? Mm-hmm, we can't let 'em keep on stealing our cattle till we have none left, so we have to keep 'em out, don't we? You betcha, Pop, and when I grow up, - I'll help you fight 'em. - Sure. Hush, Pax. You mustn't talk like that. What do you want him to be, a mollycoddle, afraid to fight for what's his? I want him to know there are two ways of putting out a hand, in a shake or a slap. You get back a hand according. Howdy, I'd like to see Bryce or Taylor. Pax, it is a mighty good notion, getting this breed. It's certainly built to pack a lot of beef. Look, Dad. He's got a pillow on the neck. That's a brahma bull, Pax. We'll cross him with our longhorns, and that'll give us a higher percentage of beef. Bryce and Taylor are sure getting highfalutin, building a castle like this. I wouldn't mind being in their boots. Well, you could be if you pushed folks off the land the way they have. They tried to buy me out, but I sent them packing. I told Bryce he wasn't trampling on me. Crowder's got a lot of nerve, coming here after running you two hand. I wonder what he wants? I don't know. Howdy, boys. Hello, Crowder. Hello. Now, we came to, uh, well, a brahma. Aren't Texas longhorns good enough for your outfit? We decided that improving our stock might encourage our neighbors to do likewise. Leading ranchers should set an example, of else how is the cattle industry in Texas going to grow? It was growing before you were born, and it'll be growing after you're gone. I'll shove it along while I'm here, and my son will carry on where I leave off. I'm learning now, Mr. Crowder. I'm gonna be Pop's right-hand man. Well, how about getting down to business? This is Mr. McKay. He represents the Great Southwest Railroad Company. How do you do, sir? - Mr. Bryce and Mr. Taylor. - Mr. Bryce. How are you? How do you do? Mr. McKay has a deal for you. It concerns every man here. Well, might as well be comfortable. Sit down, gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead, Mr. McKay. Well, gentlemen, our company proposes to build a line from Abilene to Riverford, and we're obtaining rights of way. So far, everyone along the route has given us permission, but we must have yours to complete the final link. Sorry, Mr. McKay, but for my part, no railroad is going through our property. Well, you can't think of yourself all the time, Bryce. This'll benefit the whole community and make Riverford a great cattle center. Maybe, and it'll also bring in a tidal wave of settlers. Before you know it, they'll be demanding roads, town sites. They'll cut up the land into farms. We cattlemen will be crowded out. Hold on, Pax. Maybe we can get on without a railroad, but I claim some of the smaller outfits are entitled to make a decent profit, too. And they can, by freighting their cattle to Abeline instead of driving 'em. You're right. Mr. Taylor's right. You know the cattle industry needs range, enormous range, and a railroad will kill it. I say it stays out. You've got your sights levelled on the wrong target, Pax. I guess there's nothing I can say that will switch him. Mr. Bryce, don't you realize you're stopping development in this territory? McKay, it's taken years to put this range together, years of sweat, struggle, and fight. I am not letting your railroad tear it down. I am sorry we can't get together. So am I, goodbye. Goodbye. Mr. Crowder, it looks like our deal is off. None of the land is any good to us without theirs. Well, they're riding high now, but they won't ride on forever. When I was walking down Paradise Street, hey, hey, blow the man down. Up with the young damsel that I chanced to meet, give me some time to blow the man down. Where did you get my pet fan? I borrowed it to shoe the flies off Patch. She growed a tail for that purpose. Not on her front end. You don't mind, do you, Mom? If anything should happen to it, I'll buy you another one. You could never replace it, darling. It's the first present your father ever game me. Oh, I'll be careful. I'll put it away as soon as we get home. A rabbit, let's chase it. Bryce can drive off some of the smaller outfits, but he can't stop this drive, not if we all stick together. Still and all, it will be a trespassing. Well, how are we gonna get our cows to market? Why, it would take a week to circle their range. If we don't shortcut, we have to cross the river and get on through the bayous. We can't drive steers through mud that has no bottom. [inaudible] cut across Dry Creek. The Bryce-Taylor outfit shot 20 of his steers and creased him in the shoulder. Well, they're clamping down on us, just like they planned all along. They won't be satisfied until they starve every one of us out. No sidewinder is gonna keep me from making a living. Me, neither. Just let 'em try to stop us. Sorry, Mr. Crowder, but you can't cut across Bryce-Taylor Ranch anymore. Well, we've been doing it right along, and we don't aim to change now. Mr. Bryce says different. Boyd, you keep out of the way. We're coming through. Crowder, turn those cows. We don't want trouble. Son, you've got it. All right, bring 'em on. Stop. You can't come on our place. My pop said so. Come on. Over there! Drive my cattle. There's no space, Pax. Get out of the way. Stop. Pax. Stop. Pax. I tried to keep 'em out, Pop... like you said. Pax. Oh, no. Oh, Dan. There's something I want to say, Pax. I've been doing a heap of calculating. Oh, not now, Dan. I can't think. I've been going crazy. I can't believe he's gone. I had so many plans for him. How's Abby? She hasn't talked to me for days. She's taking it pretty hard. Swine, they won't be staying... They're not responsible. You are. You pinned them in a corner, drove them into going against you. They didn't have to kill my son. I'll keep 'em off this place. I'll fence the whole ranch. I'll put a bullet in the first one that sets foot on it. And you'll do it alone. When we started this ranch, we wanted to make it something we'd be proud of, but you've turned it into a thing that reeks of greed and oppression and a thing that all decent people hold against. It's already cost the life of an innocent child. What's happened is only the beginning. There will be more killings, more bloodshed, and for what, so you can have a few more miles or range and a few more cows? I can't stomach your notions any longer. You've gone soft. Well, I won't. You've done enough. Stay out of this, Abby. Now, I have had my craw full. I am putting an end to this partnership. Good, I'll buy your interest. That suits me. Paxton, listen. Hate and revenge will destroy you. It won't bring our son back. What kind of a mother are you? You want me to turn my other cheek? Well, I won't. That's not my way. Your way is to rule and trample the people, grab for yourself at every turn. You taught it to Pax. You're very words led him to it. It's easy enough to blame me. But if I had it all to do over again, I'd still teach him to fight for what's his. Pax, you're blind, and you'll stay blind. There's no place in your heart for love and understanding. I can't go on like this. That's up to you. I'll miss your spouting, you big walrus, but Ms. Abby will need me. Goodbye, Sailaway. You've been awfully kind to me. Thanks, ma'am. Things won't seem ship shape around here without you. Bye. Abby... Still set on leaving? I'm sorry, Pax, terribly sorry. We had something fine and beautiful. It wasn't enough for us. Ready, Abby? I'll have the money for you as soon as possible. Whenever is convenient, we'll be in Riverford. Goodbye, Abby. Goodbye. Mr. Bryce, Mr. Sailaway told me to give you this. So he ran out on me, too. I ain't running out on you, Mr. Bryce. Yes, sir, you betcha. I tore right into them pirates. I cracked 'em on their skulls so hard, I busted all their toes. Bravo, bravo, mon ami. Honored to meet you, two honors to meet you. Sure. Why don't you stay here in Luciana and come to work with me at the Rancho [inaudible]. Nope, I'm going back to the sea. I hate ranches. They change people. It makes them forget to be human. But my boss, he's almost human. He pays well. He got so many cows you can hardly see the grass. We find them in Texas by the [inaudible]. I don't care where you found them. From now on, cows is only steaks to me. All right, have it your way, but honor me by meeting my boss. He like to meet men with courage, like you. All right, we'll buy him a drink. All right, and we'll drink it, and we don't care. Sure. What's the matter? Are you sick? My liver, is that your boss? Oui, monsieur, come with me, will ya? Come and meet him. I'll meet him later. I'm ill. My liver is turning into a turtle. Oh, come on. Come on, [inaudible], a friend. I like him. He's cool. Is that right, 1, 4, 7, 3, 4? 14,734, check. Mm-hmm, as near as I can configure, Dan's share comes close to $1/2 million. If we raise that much cash, that'll leave us with a mighty small herd. Hi, Skipper. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be halfway to the Gulf. I was, but I ain't. I don't want no shore leave when there's some fighting to do. You're drunk. But just the same, my eyes and ears ain't. I found out where your cows been going to. Yeah, where? Mr. Beauchard shanghaied 'em. Beauchard? Should Now I know you're drunk. Sure, but just the same, I saw him just as plain as [inaudible] light in a tavern across the river. Where you been all this time? Shh. Shh. That's a neat job of working these brands over. Looks like they're all wearing them. Round up a couple of them. We'll take them along for evidence. One bellow out of you, and I'll tie your tongue to your trail. Hey, what an evening we have, huh? Now, we can dream of our sweetheart. Well, if it is not my old friend. Why you no let me know you was coming? I stay home to welcome you. I didn't want to put you to any trouble. Besides, this isn't a social call, Beauchard. In the last seven years, you've stolen 10,000 of my cattle. A normal increase would've raised that to about 50,000. That makes you owe me plenty of hard cash. But I will take my share of our partnership, and I keep it. I have men, both loyal and brave, and they will not let you take my cows from my ranch. There's more than one way of collecting a debt. If you kill me, my men will shoot you before you can go a mile. So what you gain, eh? I guess you're right. I hadn't thought about that. But what can you do about this? Dominique Beauchard, you have been found guilty of the charge of capital stealing. The sentence of this court is that you be confined for the term of from two to five years. That's just a vacation. If I was skipping this here show, I'd stake him out on a yard arm. Shh. Mr. Bryce, I understand you have filed suit in the Louisiana courts for the value of your stolen cattle. In view of this verdict, you should get your money quickly. It is bad to lose the money, but it is better to save the neck, eh? Your luck is they only tried you for stealing cattle. You have no cause to grin. Stand up. I'm not through with you yet. There is another matter. Beauchard, you've been a thorn in the side of law and order in Texas for over 10 years, but the law always catches up with killers like you. For your raid on Clarksville, where you were responsible for the death of four persons and on Melford, which you burned to the ground at a cost of more lives, for your attack on half a dozen ranches, the order of this course is that you be remanded to the custody of the sheriff to stand trail for murder. Court dismissed. Thanks for everything, Beauchard. It is too soon for thanks, monsieur. I promise you. You are very foxy. Foxy, yeah, but look. I am in here. That's a good one. That sure is a good one. What do you want? I have fresh clothes for Monsieur Beauchard. All right, come in. Let's have a look at them. Oh, oui, oh, they are just handkerchiefs, socks, and a robe that will keep him warm. Oh, a cord, uh, to tie around the middle to keep up the whole arm, huh? All right, let me have them. Hey, but why are you keep me wait so many days? The police come to the ranch. We had to hide in the hills. And they have taken all the gold and put it in the bank until they're there for it. Oh, well, that is most convenient. Well, we'll be rolling east in about 10 minutes. Do you suppose we'll ever get used to living there again after all this? Oh, sure, we will, and it'll be better. Barbed wire, consigned to the Bryce-Taylor Ranch, confound Pax's hide. He's just begging for trouble. Oh, Dan, he is so wrong. And the terrible part is he believes he's right. Now will you agree that we've got to clip Bryce's wings? That's the cruelest contraption ever invented, and he's using it to fence his whole range. It started coming in last night, and they've carted most of it away. They called it barbed wire. Look at them barbs. Well, that'll tear the cattle to pieces. We've got to drive him out of the country before he puts up a [inaudible]. Well, he's like jimson weed. He's choking us to death. I'm for making a necktie social. Now, you're talking. We'll all meet tonight at Mesquite Flats. Pass the word to the rest of the men, and get to every man in Riverford. Let's go. Let's get out of here, too. Dan, we'll have to warn him. They'll kill him. I thought I'd stop loving him, but I haven't. When it comes to Pax, changing our minds is a Taylor habit. I'll ride out. You and Runty stay here at the hotel while this thing blows over. And they won't rest until you're swinging from a limb, Pax. Now, come on and give up the idea of using barbed wire. I'll run this ranch as I see fit. No mob is gonna dictate to me when I'm in the right. You're no more in the right than you were when you accused them of rustling. Oh, admit it and pull in your horns. Dan, my son died keeping them off this place. And as long as I live, they're gonna stay off, if I have to turn Texas upside down. They'll pull this house apart brick by brick and... What do you care? It's not your property. You got your check. Now, go on, before they show up. All right, I'll go. For 15 years, I've been sticking my neck out beside yours. Now, I'm through. Runty, where have you been? Dan hasn't come back yet, and I'm worried. I'm going to the ranch. Well, you can bet I'll get you out of here. Riverford ain't gonna be healthy. Why? What's happened? Well, nothing, I was down by the river and heard two Frenchy boatmen yammering. Beauchard and his pack of scuttlers are coming in from Las Cumbres, and they're gonna sack the town. There's nobody here to stop them. Crowder and his men... I know all about it, Cal. Runty and I will try to stop them at the flat. You get all the women and children together and put them in the schoolhouse. Well, it looks like every man in town turned out. All right, men, march your horses. Get your rifles from Mr. Whites on the porch. Your ammunition is there, too. Got an extra six shooter for me? I was hoping you'd come back. The fight wouldn't seem natural without the two of us in it. Well, that's the way I figure. They may have left the flats by now. You go on after them, and I'll shortcut to the ranch and get help. Aye aye, Skipper. Hey, [inaudible]. Every man in town is gone. Only the old ones stayed there. Oh, certainly, those ranchers, they make Monsieur Bryce pay for his sins. And while they do, Dominique Beauchard will collect, eh? We march. Remember, the ranches in the valley belong to you, and I give you the town also, but not the bank. That belong to me. Hold it. Hey, Skipper, it's Ms. Abby. Open the gates. Open 'em up. I thought I told you to stay in town until this thing blows over. Beauchard's at Las Cumbres, and he's got hundreds of men. He's gonna attack Riverford. Let him attack. But, Pax, he'll wipe out the entire valley. Those women and children... Let their men take care of them instead of using their mob rule on me. Runty's gone after them, but I'm afraid he won't reach them in time. You can't let those women and children suffer, Pax. Your fight's not with them. She's right, Pax. Why should I worry about their families? They didn't worry about mine. Even so, we've got to help them. While we ride to the rescue, that pack of wolves tears my ranch apart. Oh, no, Pax, Jr. paid a big price for this place, and I'm not letting go for a noble gesture. It won't make it easier on you to bring agony on others, in spite of what those men have done. They love their families as much as we loved Pax. Would you want them to go through what we have? No, I wouldn't. You go down to the old ranch house with Willa May. You'll be safer there. Well, Dan, I guess this is the end of our empire. Sure, but I've got a notion you're starting to build something better. Sailaway, Ford, all you men, get your horses. Beauchard's got us outnumbered, but from where he is, he'll have to go through Bottleneck Pass. We're a lot closer to it than he is. I've got a hunch we can even up the odds. You all ready, men? Yeah. Come on, keep working. Make those anchor posts good and solid, men. If that fire trap doesn't hold them, this barricade has got to. Throw some brush over it. Hey. Whoa, hey. Hey, you fellas better pound it back to town 'cause Beauchard's gonna pounce on it. Well, you hold your shirttail. He's up in jail in Sabine. Taylor told me so, himself. Well, this rabbit is just one of Bryce's men. It's a trick to stall us. It is not a trick. I tell ya. Beauchard is heading for the... You go back and tell your boss we're not giving him time to get set for us. Go on. Oh, listen, fellas. Hey, Crowder, wait, hey. Lay low and wait for the signal. All right, men, get down. I don't want to spoil everything. Wait till they start coming back out. Come on, Ford. Start plugging that gap. Light up, here. What kind of trick is this? Pierre, it is not good to play with fire. We go back. We take longer way to town. All right, let 'em go. Hop to it. Keep this fire blazing! [inaudible]. Come with me. We are trapped, but we'll get out. Follow me. Get ready, men. Wait till they start up the slope. Now will you believe me? Them ain't dogs barking. Sounds like it's coming from the bottleneck. Well, maybe Bryce sent some of his men to draw us off. That firing is too heavy. Bryce hasn't got that big of a gun. I'm taking a look. Hey, we better all take a look, huh? Come on. Hey. Hey, tell Willy about that one, will ya? Make a go for it. Another man down, Pax. Back to the rocks. Eh, [inaudible], cactus wire, huh? Well, salut. Pull it. Pull it down. Pull it down. Pull it. Pull it. Pull those ropes. Pull. We gotta play our ace, Pax. Sure, Skipper, let's give it to 'em. Go ahead. That blast ought to stop them. Hold it, men. Round 'em up. He ain't trumped, but he's sure for drydock. Bryce, from now on, you can string as much of that barbed wire as you want to, and I'll go to help you. You fellas saved our families, and we won't forget it. I guess we've both been wrong, Crowder. I can't stop the railroads any more than you can stop fenced-in ranges. They're both here to stay because they both mean progress. Texas is... Dan, you better finish. Well, Pax means that if we all pull together, we can make this the finest state in the union, the cattle center of the country, so we're letting the railroad through. When we put up our fences, we're gonna leave plenty of gates for our neighbors. Give me them pills, you big bunch of barnacle. You ain't giving these to the Skipper, your little sand crab. Let go, or I'll flatten you like a flounder. But the catalog says they're good for man or beast. Yeah, sure, I swallowed one this morning, - and my teeth are still rattling. - I don't care. - Give them to me. - No. Now, give me them. Here's the bottle. Eat one pill, it'll make you tie a knot in an octopus. Eat 'em yourself. She's all the medicine I'll ever need.
