Just headed up to the lake. Anything else? Yeah, this too. You like that one, right? Thanks. So we get service. That's good. Yeah, I saw you on your phone over there and didn't expect we get service. That's good. This is beautiful, huh? Literally, everything is dead. Fine. I'm sorry. My God. Why, what for? I don't know, 'cause you're mad. What does that even mean? You're mad, I just wanna make you feel better. - Okay, you're gonna answer that, wow. Do you really not know really? And don't lie. No, I don't know. But if I did something wrong, I'm so sorry. My God. How could you be sorry when you don't know what you're sorry for? Bullshit, Albee. All right, all right, You just wanna tell me why you're upset? Oh my God, Walker, I don't care anymore. I don't care. - Yeah, well I do. Okay, all I said was baby, hey, I don't think we can afford it, that's it. No, that is not how you said it. You weren't all sweet and like, "Oh baby." No, you fucking said it like I was retarded. Hey Albee, come on. Don't use that word. What about Ricky? Okay, like I was special. Is that better? Well, you're special to me. I'm just saying that if we're gonna do this shitty thing, we might as well do it at the beach. Yes, but it doesn't have to be shitty. Okay, yeah. Fixing your marriage is so much fun. I heard it's a real party. Okay Albee, just get it out. There's nothing left to say, Walker. Just 'cause we're going up the mountain, we're fine. I think we're close. Hey. Want some fries? I could do fries. So what happens if I get an audition? It's the weekend. I audition on weekends all the time. One time. And I'm not sure you're willing to be the face of a Mexican tampon. Point is that I better not miss anything important. Yeah, well hopefully this is more important. How does it work? We do the book, I guess. They put cheese on this. That's cool. Can I get a pill? Well, yeah, but I mean like walk me through it. What is the plan? Well, there are seven questions. So I figured we. Hey, what are you doing? I thought you wanted to start. No. We are not having a marriage crisis in the middle of a fucking diner. Guess what? No one knows what we're doing. They will. Okay, in 10 minutes we'll be screaming each other's heads off and you'll be sad and I'll be the bitch. So can we please just fall apart somewhere private. - Al, it's just seven questions. - Like a normal couple. We don't have to kill each other. Do you think you would kill me? Maybe you just don't know your husband like you think you do. See. You're just being a brat. Plus these are pretty delicious, so it's just a win in my book. Walk me through it. We do the book. Okay, but like gimme a road map or something. There's two days, right. So I'm thinking that we do four tomorrow, three Sunday, or we could do it the other way around. But hopefully we just, we go back to L.A. happy, you know, together. But we have to be honest. Okay, that's like literally the only thing, it's total honesty, good or bad we're. - Okay, I get it. - Yeah? Yes. Okay cool, deal. Walker. Shake my hand. Come on this is us making an agreement that we're gonna do our best, that we will try, okay. Have you? Just shake my goddamn hand, Albee, okay. This is us doing it properly. We're gonna be honest and hopefully we fix it, okay. You're gonna have a stroke. Okay. That's okay. Hey. God, you're so corny. Is this where you come to murder me? Oh, you know, I thought murder might be better than divorce. There's, oh, there's a creature. Oh. It's Daphne from, "Scooby Doo." Hey guys. Hi, sorry we're late. No, no, no, grab your bags, come on in. Is this your idea of romance? Yeah, yeah. There's hikes and the lake, you'll see. If we make it that far. Here we are. Oh, there's the champagne and cheese you asked for. Wow, yeah, this is perfect. Right, Albee? It's a dream. When did you guys get married? Eight long years ago. No, you're so young. Yeah, we were 16, it was Texas. Oh. Well you have such a beautiful face. Is that what you do in L.A? Have a face? No, I meant model or act or. Yeah, she does. She's an actress or starting out anyway, right baby? Yep. I guess that's it. Oh, oh, did you see the Ferris wheel on your way in? The Brians set it up every summer. Wine, picnics. Yeah, no, I was hoping we could hit that on Sunday, on our way back home. If we're not divorced. That's why we're here. Jesus. Yeah, we're just sorting some things out. Okay. If you need anything, you have our numbers. Thanks. Good night. Night. God, I need a bath. Hey, how are they? Oh, he's a sweetheart. She's ahh, she's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. This sounds bad, but you can tell she's the kind of girl that just thinks she's too good for him, you know? Yeah, yeah, I know the kind. Really? Yeah, for sure, like beautiful, thinks they're too good for their fiances. Yeah, why do I get the sense that in your case it's actually true. I have no idea. No? Okay then. Hey. Hey. I'm in the bath. Well, I know that. You want some champagne? No. What's going on? Walker, what happens if it doesn't work? Why do you keep asking me that? Just walk me through it. Well, we break up, I guess. I don't know, we finish it. It's like you said, right. But I think if we got through this last month, I think we can get through anything. We would be okay, right? I mean, you would be okay. Shut up. Really though. I am. I'm really happy. Me too. Let's not change that, yeah. Let's just always have fun. Yeah, I'd like that. Hey, I was thinking maybe we should have them over for lunch, the guests. You said that she was a dick. No, they're just young. I think they're having relationship problems. What about our rule? No hang with the guests. Yeah, you hate rules. Yeah I do, I'm a rebel. Yeah. Oh but seriously though, bad relationships are contagious, we don't want that. That's silly, it's one meal. I love that you care about them, but maybe they're not supposed be together. Maybe they are. Well then they will be. Hey. Is there no WiFi here? Seriously, there's no service and no WiFi. Did I not mention that? You sure? It must have slipped my mind. But there are bears here, what if something happens? Babe, if you get attacked by a bear, who the hell are you calling? The bear police. I don't know why you didn't just get twin beds, that couch looks shitty. Well because I am an optimist. I'm not there. Okay. I'm sorry. No, that's, that's okay. It's okay. Sleep tight. Al? Shit. Hey. Hey. Is that alter coming? You think you might finish it this week? Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Hey, any of that for me? Nope. Oh wait, wait, wait, let me run that down. I don't trust you. Love you, Babe. Got it. Okay. Shall we do this? All right, let's see. It says, "Creating a sense of space and peace "between you and your spouse. "Ask each other the following question. "Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. "There are just contra." Look it's basically just saying that we need to be super honest and we already agreed that we're gonna do that, right? - Let's just go. Yeah. I'm gonna. So, Albee, what was the first thing that drew you to me? So like, what did you like about me? Oh is that what that means? Why are you being so pissy this morning? I don't know, why are you being so stupid? First thing that comes to mind, just whatever attracted you to me. Oh my God. Al. Al. Hold on, I'm thinking. That you liked me, I guess. That I liked you. Sure. That I liked you, are you being serious? So, I could have been a serial killer, but as long as I liked you. God, that's so dramatic. Also, you said there are no wrong answers. No. No, you actually used to say really nice things about me. Okay, fine, I liked your laugh. Is that better? God, it was so long ago. Well, shit, I remember. You remember meeting me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna sound like an idiot now, but of course I remember the first time I saw you so clearly. Fine. Fine, yeah, you were in the TV room of the big house and you had this blue, like, right past the knees, dress. Right, and you got it dirty, which you got in trouble for. And obviously that made you so mad and you were just pretty, you know, but it was more than that, there was something special about you. Special? I'm being serious Al, there was something important about you. - Oh my God, Walker. I could see it even then. We were 12. So. So the only way that I could have been special to you is if I was made of candy. I mean, when you're young like that, you get crushes, then they're just stupid little, nothing crushes. It's just that usually people grow out of them. The thing is that we were idiots and we got married. No, no, no, we were so happy. No, you just saw some girl in a dress and came all over yourself, like every other stupid idiot boy in that place. So by that thinking then a bunch of boys liked you? Yeah, sure, lucky me. Yeah, well you chose me. So whether you want to admit it or not, there was something that you did like about me. Or you were just the first one that asked. Why do you act like this just never worked? Is this done? I answered your question, this is done. Really? Hey, can we? Al. Albee. Well what happened? They weren't home. Yeah, I thought I'd go grab yourself from Joan. Do you need anything from town? Oh, just my dress. And you are not seeing that. Okay, I'll be right back. Don't go make any new friends, okay. Hey, just me. Oh, hey, sorry, I was just checking this out and you know, you might wanna. You know, I noticed that you're using framing lumber for the deck and you're gonna want some thicker posts, if you want to keep this thing level. And you're gonna need some more materials as well. When did you want this thing done? Oh, two weeks. Oh, well, I can help you if you want. Just that this is a bit of a mess. It is? Yeah. No, of course you don't need to do that. It's not a problem, it's a pretty easy job, if you know what you're doing. You don't say. You're married, is this just what it's like? Oh, no, not yet. I mean, that's what all this is for, but no. Oh. She's not always like that. We were good. You know, we were really good at the start, and then we weren't, she wasn't. Do you know why? I figured it's 'cause she got to know me better. She just had a tough time growing up. My parents were a bit of a nightmare. So I get that. No, it was a foster home. That's where we met. Oh, so you lived together? No, no, it was a group home. She got adopted and yeah. The guy that adopted her, he's got a nice seat in hell waiting for him. Yeah. What about you? Are you happy? I'm not dumb. I told her I look after her, I promised her I would, so, I will. Morning Joan. Hey. Just grabbing some lumber for the wedding. Oh cool, how's the build coming? Oh, you know, I think it's getting pretty close. Awesome. Then I guess you have time for a beer. Beer for breakfast. You're having one. It's Saturday. Let's think of more reasons. Okay. Big weekend or something? Something. I'm Ben, by the way. Ben, did I look like I wanted to chat? 'Cause if so, I'll change what I'm doing. Hey, I'm happy to go. It's just kind of early for you to be hitting on me. No, you're not my type. This is just me being friendly. That is usually my experience with older men and bars. So friendly. Okay, fine, maybe you looked a little lonely. Think you can fix it? So you're flirting with me now. This is just me being friendly. Hey Ben, will you tell your fiance that I'm done with the alterations. I'll come by tomorrow. Thank you, Joan. Get you anything else? No, this is good. You can put it on his tab. Relax, she's staying at the cabin. Walker. Hey. What is this? What's it look like? You said we never have fun. This is us having fun. And I brought your favorite. This is so you. Yeah it is. All right, we're gonna lift this thing on three. You ready? One, two, three. Look at you muscles. Yeah, actually I could use some help. Oh yeah. You know, I think I'm carrying this by myself. Where should we launch this, here? Maybe over here? I don't know, maybe by the lake somewhere. Yeah, it's starting to get a little heavy. Oh, you sure you don't want me to push this out? Hey, I'm from Texas too, you know. Walker, what is that? Oh yeah, I thought we could do a couple questions while we were having fun. Oh you did, you sly, sly boy. Can't run away on a boat. Oh no. No, Albee. Albee, Albee, Albee. Yeah, well, have a nice trip. Okay baby, you know this isn't gonna stop me. I'm sorry, what? What'd you say? - All right, all right, let's do it. Here we are, question two. "Start by thanking your partner for their time." I'll start. Thank you Albee for taking this time. Yeah, you wanna say it back? No, I'm good. All right, well, you know, I heard that canoeing makes the heart grow fonder. Actually it's rowing. Rowing makes the heart grow fonder. You look a little hungry. Oh. - What even is that? - Oh, that's on me. I'm sorry, which one of us played baseball. All right, they're bringing in the reliever. Is your arm okay? - Ready? - What's going on? What are you trying to kill me? You gotta catch that. She's calling for a fastball. Oh, that was high and outside. You can do better. What are you gonna throw walks all day? You sure you don't want to come out here? You're on your own buddy. Yeah, that's right, bring it in. Walker, where are you going? I got the whole lake ahead of me. Walker. Walker. Walker. Hey, the cabin lady came by the lake and invited us to lunch, and I said, yes. Why? Because what else was I supposed to say? Nothing. Why would you do that? We talked about this. Because it's the right thing to do. Also, it just kind of slipped out. Look, I had this really awkward thing with her today. What thing? Oh, at the bar, just kind of feeling her out. What? Just see how much of an asshole she was, you know? Not really. And don't call her that, we don't even know her. It wasn't weird. I was just curious to see what she was gonna do to this guy to see if he could trust her. That's all. And here you're telling me not to interfere. It's one lunch. Besides I figured you want me to make up for being such a bitch last night. Sure, sounds good. Look, we'll just eat quick and we'll just get 'em outta here, yeah. Oh God, maybe this was a mistake. It was your idea. Why are you being so weird? Hi. This is Ben. Walker, Albee. Nice to meet you. Again. He told me he met you, how funny? Yeah, it's so funny, he didn't mention you. Well, you weren't exactly chatty. Funny, you didn't mention it either. Because it wasn't very memorable. It's simple. Oh, that's not gluten free, if that's still a thing. It looks good, Babe. Wine? I'll have some. That's very friendly of you. Walker, some wine? You got anything stronger? Yeah, I do, be right back. Stronger? Like you said, it's a party. Here you go man. Cheers. So, you guys are getting married? That's the plan. Oh, we're gonna do it right here, actually, if we can get the altar finished in time. Well that's easy, 'cause I used to do carpentry in L.A. so. He was in a band, weren't you, Babe. They were amazing. They were? So what is here, anyway, camp? That's the plan, yeah, a little summer camp. You know, once we get it fixed up. Oh, it was Ben's idea to use it as an Airbnb first though. If you need to fix it, Walker could help you. He loves broken shit. What's going on? What? Fuck you, what are you doing? Just eating lunch. By the way this pasta salad is so good, thank you. Okay, you're mad. We were supposed to be doing something else and I changed the plan, so he's upset. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. Oh no, don't apologize please, it's completely fine. You don't look fine, Walker, you look mad, own it. Maybe just leave him alone. Baby, I thought honesty was the point of this weekend, right? So just say something, get angry. It was a book, it's some $5 piece of shit, that's supposed to make us happy. It's called, "Seven Questions to Grow a Spine." Yep. I'm sorry, he's just determined to make me look like an asshole. Okay, fine, we'll do the book. I'm really sorry about lunch, you guys. Let's go at Walker. I'm good. Walker, I said we could do the book. Your point is made, let's go. Maybe you're right, you know, maybe they are just seven dumb questions. You know, I think those books are great. We did marriage classes in the spring, right Ben? Babe, no. I know it can be uncomfortable, but we found it to be very helpful. I'm sure you did. Walker, let's go. Well, we could always do a few questions together if that helps? Carly, no. Look, it's clear that you all are in a very hard place, but maybe that's why you came here so we could help you. Maybe she's right. Walker, you really wanna do this in front of them? Think about that. You know me so well, do I? Great, I'll grab the book. Walker, hey, what the actual fuck, why would you do that? What? You wanna hang, I wanna do the book, perfect solution. No, I did not come here, so the Anne of fucking Green Gables would be our marriage counselor. Why? Well, I don't wanna embarrass you in front of anyone. Well, that's a first. See, this is great, we're already making progress. Look, I get it, and I love your concern, but this isn't our place. Well, I grew up learning to help people when they need it. She doesn't need your help, she needs an exorcist. Then he does. And I disagree. Do you know that they were foster kids? How could I know that? Look, that's awful, I'm sorry. It is awful. He said she had a terrible childhood, which just makes so much sense. You know, people like her, they're just scared. No, Carly, no, she's not scared, she's a fucking monster. Believe me when I say this, I dated girls like her for 20 years. I think it's the right thing to do. Well, I don't. Then I'm asking you to do this one thing for me. It is that important. Can you do that for me please? Yeah. Vape, neat. You know, all the kids are doing it. Yeah, you gotta let that kid go. Just fucking end it. Good chat. Listen, I'm gonna be nice to you because Carly wants me to be, but I just want you to know you're a fucking asshole. Seriously, this whole, "Mean Girl" bullshit is tacky. Yeah, well coming from the guy who looks like a backup singer for Lenny Kravitz, I think I'll live. Fuck you. By the way, I also think you're an asshole. Do I just start? What are we doing? Just one question please, Ben. Okay, so, it says, "The goal of this question "is to clear old wounds that. "To clear old wounds that might have become." Do you wanna get that? No, that would be rude. But I will do the reading for you, Babe, that was never really your strong suit. So, skip that, "Looking at your partner, tell them the first time "you felt wounded by them." Wounded, oh, another winner. Wounded anyone? Well, why don't we go first? Why are we doing this? Okay, fine, fine. I can go first if you want. No, you don't have to go first. Can somebody go? Okay, I got it, okay. All right. Remember that table I made for you, like a couple months in? The side table? Yeah, it was like the first thing I made you. And it's kind of dumb, but when I gave it to you, you laughed. I don't remember that. I love that table. Yeah to put that fucking doily thing on it. Maybe, I wouldn't pick it out myself, but hey, I love it now. I don't know why this bothering me. It's because you cared. Yeah, I had no idea. Well, this is a good fucking book. Okay wait, she laughed at your woodwork, are you fucking kidding me? It was important to him. It's woodwork. What are you six? Well, I'm sorry we're not as miserable as you. Seems like you're halfway there. God, like what is hers gonna be, that you don't recycle? I thought we were fucked up. Look, I appreciate the honesty. I told you, Babe. That was not honesty, that was bullshit. Okay, people hurt each other. Yeah, well not everybody clearly. Okay, fine, people who love each other hurt each other. How about that? How does he hurt you? And you want us to believe that you are in love with him, yeah? Hey, do you think she'd be wounded, if I told her how you hit on me this morning? Nice try, I already told her I spoke to you. And you know what? I wasn't hitting on you, I was feeling you had to see if you were cheating on him. You bought that? Good for you. Yeah, she did because we have trust, something you wouldn't fucking understand. Calm down. Yeah, Ben, what's got you riled up. Actually, I wanna talk to the fiance for a second. You trust him? Yes, 100%, that's why I'm marrying him. Really? I mean, he's a good looking guy, that must have been a real catch for a girl like you. Don't you talk to her like that. The kind of guy that you overlooked some issues for, you know what I mean? You're just being mean. It makes you wonder though, doesn't it? What about me, Albee? What about you? What's the worst thing ever did to you? It's easy, you're a liar. It's what I hate about you. You're lying right now. What? You can't do that I don't lie. How can you even say that? It's my question, I don't need to explain it. You know what your problem is? Oh, please enlighten us. Everything is a compromise. You don't realize that no one gets what they want. Maybe you don't. Don't change the subject, just answer me. Okay, fine. I'll answer you by doing yours for you, how about that? So when could I possibly have hurt Walker? Oh, I've got one. It was our honeymoon. You remember that, right Walker? You took me to that shitty motel in beautiful Jersey. This was the one time in my life that I was maybe interested in the idea of sex. And Walker here had a problem rising to the challenge. So what did I do? Did I kiss him and make it better? Did I work him up? No. I made him cry. Isn't that right, Walk? He probably had too much to drink. It happens all the time. Sure does. That's not the point. I'm cruel and I know it. So how does that make him a liar, huh? You're crazy. Because he's sitting here married to me, acting like I'm not. Why? Because I love you Albee. There it is. You can't Walker. You might think you do, but you don't. Pretty sure he does. Oh, thanks cabin lady. We've known you for what? Three hours. - What are you talking about Albee? Everything I do is for you, everything. I moved to L.A. for you. Okay, that's for us because I love you. How can you even say that? Look at you, you're so mad, you look like you wanna put your hand through a wall. But what are you gonna do? Nothing. You're just gonna tell me that you love me when you should hate me. God fucking dammit, would you just turn this stupid piece of shit off? Or what? You'll cry. What is wrong with you? I warned you. Fuck it, last question. Shoot. Did you ever love me or is this just so you could get away from? Don't, Walker. Then fucking answer me. Fine, did I come here thinking that fucking a plate of cheese and a book is gonna fix this? No, idiot, I didn't. Walker. Fuck. Walker. Walker, no. Walker, don't you dare. I swear to God. Oh my God. What did you do? What I should've done eight goddamn years ago. I didn't have a phone eight years ago, asshole. Are you crying? No, you owe me a new phone. What the fuck, you're crying over a phone? Fuck you. Were you ever gonna try to fix this? Huh, did you have any intention of trying to make this better? - No, never. I don't know if that makes you happy or I don't know what you thought was gonna happen. Do you love me, Albee? Did you ever even like me? Actually, I asked you answered. - Walker. - Go. I need you to stop saying that, okay. Because I know that. Could you please stop cleaning for one second? I can put things away and talk at the same time. I did not mean for things to go this way. Yeah, I know but I told you. I warned you. Okay, I get it, you know that kind of girl. Well, I know that kind of boy and I felt bad for him. Honey, I love you, I do, okay. But this whole saving people bullshit, it's just. Okay, I'm sorry, forget it. I'm just gonna go get some work done. What a nice idea. Babe. Babe, are you up? Hey, you beat me to it. I got the croissants that you like. Thanks. This is for the guests. That's optimistic. Hey, are we okay? Yeah, I'm tired. Look, I know you were trying to do a good thing. And I was being a dick. I was saying things that I didn't even mean. Okay, I'm gonna be better. I love you. I love you too. Joan is coming over later to fit the dress. So you need to be out of the house. Okay. I'll just hop in the shower and I'll go work on the deck. Okay. Hey guys, breakfast. Have you seen Walker? He didn't come home? I hoped that... We'd break up. 'Cause that's what happened. God, Albee, I'm so sorry. Don't be. It doesn't mean anything, anyway. What time is checkout? - Three, but. - Okay, great. Shit. I'm working tonight, if you wanna come down. Joan, is it ugly? What? No, it's Mom's dress. You wanted to wear this for 30 years. I know. Okay, I promise you get the fit, right. No, it's not that I just. Can I ask you something? Is this a good idea? I'm really asking. I want you to be honest. I realize I never asked you before. And then I just started thinking like maybe I never asked myself. All right, well you're not a fucking idiot. Two like caveats, A, I know shit all about dating men, so. I knew there was a reason I never asked you. Exactly. Does he make you happy? That's all that really matters. I think so. But if I'm being honest, really honest, I don't know. It's not like this clean thing. The boy, the one who's staying here, I think he would literally die for his wife. Okay, well that's just sad. Is it? Ben won't even finish the altar. It's been weeks and it is literally the place we're supposed to stand and say our vows to each other and he just won't finish it. He won't. Well, what did you expect? I'm not being mean, but he's kind of a fuck boy. How is that not mean? Okay, Cinderella. I'm just saying that he's an ex musician from L.A. who ran away to the woods. Are you really surprised he's not a grownup yet? I'm not saying he won't be, but. Right. You did say be honest. Hey man. Hey, sorry, I just kind of. Finished the whole fucking thing. Yeah. Shit, hey, did Carly see this? I haven't really seen anyone. What, did you run away from home or something? It's over between Albee and me. I finished it or she did. Maybe we both did, I don't really know. Holy shit, like it's done, done? Yep. Hey, you know what that is? That is great fucking news. You know what great fucking news needs. Ah. Hey, come on. You're a younger looking kid, you're not gonna be lonely. All right, trust me. Shit, I almost envy you. Hey, you know, I saw that you guys have some work that needs to get done around here, you know, some stuff for the wedding and whatnot, I thought maybe I could. What are you looking for a job? More a place to stay. Dude, if you tell Carly that I built this thing. You can stay here for the rest of your fucking life. I mean, you're out of the Airbnb, but you can stay at the shit cabin that we have. I don't care. Look, trust me, I know it sucks right now, but this is the best day of your fucking life. Hey, that was a real dick move of you to not come home. Well, I didn't wanna see you. People don't run not to be chased, Walker. I should know. We can't end like that. Why not? Because we didn't even do your stupid book. We still can, if you want to. Hey, I read your notes. I get it now. Okay, so what, that's it, one stupid fight and it's done? Al. Walker, you threw my phone in a lake. I got mad, you can't hate me for that. I don't hate you Albee, you know that. I'm embarrassed, you know. I've been telling you this whole time to be honest and you were. You know, it was me who wasn't listening, but I get it now, and it's okay. It fucking, it's okay. You should go. I want you to. What about you? I'm gonna stay here at the camp. Yeah. Okay, maybe Hansel and Gretel will adopt you. I'm serious, Al. Walker, no, what about the car? Take it. All your stuff is in L.A. It's yours, you could sell it if you want, I don't really care. I'll help you pay rent as long as you need me to. Can we just please not turn this into another fight? Look, you're gonna be good. You're gonna be better than good, you're gonna be great. You're you. God, of course, you're fucking nice. Hey. Hi. I was on my way out of town and I found these in my car. Walker needs them. He forgets to take them all the time, but he gets really sick if he doesn't so. Okay. Hey, are you all right? I heard that. Oh, I'm sure you guys think this is great. No, I truly just wanted to help. Look, you hated me from the moment you saw me and I don't think you were wrong too. Can I be honest? Let's don't do this right now. Go ahead. I know you had a rough time growing up, okay. And that kinda shit can leave a mark. What? The foster thing, it sounded awful and I'm sorry. He told you? All right, what we're trying to say is, we know that the foster system isn't great. Oh, what the fuck? Walker just told me a little bit. Oh, fuck you, he did. He was just trying to explain to me what happened between you guys. Look I hope that. - No, no, no. Like you're just some like hermit lady in the woods with a fucking bullshit fiance, all right. I don't know what he told you, but you don't fucking know shit about me. I'll be right back. Oh, hey, sorry. I'm just getting my final stuff outta here. Walker, listen, I'm so sorry. I think I really messed up. I told Albee what you said about the foster thing. I was just trying to help. - Did you? Yeah. Shit. Do you know where she is? I don't know, she just drove off. I'm so sorry. No, it's not your fault. Fuck. Are there any buses in town? I gotta get back to L.A. Yeah, let me drop you. Walker. Thank you. Cheers. Do you want one? Awesome. Thank you for everything. Yeah, I really hope it works out. You too, I hope the wedding goes well. Did you see the altar? Yeah. He did a really beautiful job. Hey. So what do you think? Ben. Do you want this? What? Of course I fucking do. Carly, what? Be honest. I want you to. Do you wanna get married? I don't know. Yeah. I know. It's a shame. Walker did a beautiful job. This is too easy. Shut up. Stop. Can't have it starting like that. - Was it too much? - No. I need you to get out. Hey, I'm sorry. No, it's okay, it's not you. I just. Get out. - Yeah. Yeah I can go, yeah. I'm not really sure about anything. It's okay. Come here. Is he okay? I mean, are either of you really okay? I'm so sorry about whatever happened to you. Don't be. A lot of people will feel much worse and don't act like I had. You were a kid. But I'm not anymore. That's the only reason that he proposed, was to get me out. He would never admit that, but it's true. Or maybe he loves you? No, because how can you love this? Fuck. What's scarier, that he doesn't love you or that he does? What are you doing? Just, don't stab me or anything. You're gonna be okay. You really, really are. Walker. Albee, what are you doing here? I wanted to talk. Yeah well, I don't care anymore. Yes you do. Just look gimme five minutes, all right. Come on, I fucking ran here, you know how much I hate that. Keep your arms and legs inside. Don't throw anything. Rides away. Classic Walker. Picked the happiest place to be sad. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I know that it's not your fault. Look, I wanna make you deal. No. No, Walker, trust me, you're gonna like it okay. When this ride stops, I'm gonna stay on because that's what I want. And If you wanna go, if you're really done, then you can. - Albee. I'm not gonna be mad at you. You're not a liar. Okay, you're fucking so good. God, you're so good it's like you can't even see the bad in me. And there's so much of it. Why is that all you see? I don't know. 'Cause there's something wrong with me, broken. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not broken, Al, you're stronger than me. You must be stupid if you think that then. Walker, could we just call it another bad weekend? I mean another stupid fight. I mean, we're not good at this, but how could we be? Okay, nobody ever wanted us. We're all that we ever had. Because I wanna be happy too. I deserve that. But with you I'm not. Okay, so we'll be better. - No. - I'll be better. No, you're right, we're ruining each other. No, I wasn't right. When was the last time you kissed me? Just because you wanted to, 'cause you liked me. I'm not saying it to rub your face in it. Can you remember? See, what is it that we even holding on to? You know, I'm with you and I'm so fucking lonely. Look, I know it's not fair, but what if what happened, took that part of me? I don't know Al, we can't even talk about it. I know, it's just that when I try, I literally feel like I'm falling apart. So fall apart then. Fall apart, do it. You're a fucking mess. I'm a mess. We're both a mess. No you're not. I chose you, didn't I? Yeah, you did. God, I know that I can't ask you to anymore. And that's what sucks because that is all I've ever wanted. Okay, that's all I want. And I know that even right now, as they say it, you can't believe me. Because how could you? You'll be okay Al. Please don't say that. Well you're just scared because we're all each other's ever had. No, don't say that. I'm not doing this again. You need to know that it's not your fault. Nothing's your fault, including us, we're not to blame. We're not. You had a cap on 'cause you needed a haircut. What? The day that we met, you were wearing a hat. And it was just like neon yellow, like they was scared you were gonna run into traffic or something. And I had just gotten in trouble for not wanting to play with anyone. Very surprising. And I dunno, you came in and you just sat down with me and then you took your hat off and it looked like you fucking cut your hair with a lawn mower or something. And all the other kids started making fun of you and you didn't care. You didn't care at all, you just talked with me like we were old friends or something. That was the first thing that I liked about you. You didn't run away from anything. So if you're gonna go, please take that story with you, and not the one that I said, because I lied. Okay, Walker, you're not too weak or too nice. I mean, you're not perfect, but, I don't know, it's like all this time, I've just needed you to see the ugliness in me. Because what if you don't and then I believe you and I let go, and then you see me. I'm not saying that it makes sense, but I swear, it's like the minute that you left, I understood, like I fucking woke up or something. And could you please say something? Walker you wanted me to be honest and talk, and now I am, and I don't know what to say because you're the only person that I've ever been close to. And I know that I'm shitty at it, but God, I love you. I love you so much. Walker, come here. Albee. It's okay. It's okay. Ride stops. Are we staying or going? I'll stay. Bud? Bud, are we staying or we going?
