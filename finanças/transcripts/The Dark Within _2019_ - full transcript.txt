Candidate 142, please take a seat. Please standby. Marcus. Everything okay? Latitude. 37 degrees. 14, 62, North. Longitude. 115 degrees. 48.95, West. Please proceed. Present your findings to the window on the right. Subject 142 shows enormous potential. Finally, a breakthrough. Congratulations, candidates. You are successful in reaching level six. Warning, facility lockdown in T-minus three minutes. Advance remote viewing experiment ready to commence. Let me out! Please! Open the door! Please! What have you done to us? Please! Open the door! Open the door! Please! Now, open your eyes, Marcus. How do you feel? Tired. Frustrated. Angry. I'm going to ask you a series of questions. - It's very... - Will you turn that off? It's giving me a headache. It's very important that you answer them honestly and with as much clarity as possible. When did your parents go missing? August 8th, 1991. And what happened to them? I don't know. What do you think happened to them? I don't. We've been through this a hundred times. It is my job to keep asking you these questions. And as condition of your parole, it is your job to answer them. You have to work with me here, Marcus. What do you think happened to them? I used to think they ran away and left me. And now? My best guess is they're dead. And how does that make you feel? Sad. Sad in what way? Sad because I'll never know what really happened to them. Or what really happened to me. Are your eyes bothering you again? I'm gonna write you up something for that. What about Sara, any contact? I'm not allowed. That hasn't stopped you in the past. No. None. Let's talk about what happened that day. I told you, I don't remember. Please try. I woke up from a bad dream. I had a thumping headache. I went downstairs to get some aspirin. I heard something. What did you hear? Voices. What did they say? I can't remember. When I came to, the police were there and the whole room was destroyed. How is she? You know I'm not allowed to discuss my other patients with you. But she still is your patient? She's doing fine. Let's talk about these headaches. Are you still having them? They're less frequent, but I can't seem to focus on anything. There's always going to be side effects. The important thing is that we're moving forward in the right direction. You made a lot of progress in six months, Marcus. How much longer do I have to take them? For the moment, we're gonna take it one step at a time. and if you keep progressing it will be sooner rather than later. Okay, I think that's enough for today. I'm gonna write you up something for your eyes. And Marcus, you'll get through this, I promise. I just wanna talk. Yeah, well I don't. Please. I don't have anyone else. You shouldn't be here. I'm sorry, Sara. I'd never do anything to hurt you. Yeah, well you did. You did hurt me, Marcus! I know. You have every right to hate me. I don't hate you. I'm scared of you. You should leave. I'm getting help. I'm seeing a therapist. It seems to be working. And you were right. I should have done that a long time ago. Okay, well, I'm glad to hear that. I really am. I'm glad you're getting help. But that doesn't change the fact that you came here. You can't just come to my house, Marcus. I have a restraining order against you. Do you understand what a restraining order is? Do you understand what that means? You don't care if you go to jail? I miss you. That's not fair. Are you happy? You should leave before James gets home. Marcus? Marcus? Marcus? Sorry. Sorry. I lost you again, didn't I? So what do you think? About what? The next step in your recovery. This belongs to you. It's the key to your parent's cabin. How did you get this? I contacted your trust, told them you were going up there for a couple days, and they had a courier send it over to my office. We leave first thing in the morning. Tomorrow? Do you need more time? No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's just a surprise. I need you to pack some clothes. I want you to stay for a few days. I think this is gonna be good for you, Marcus. Who knows? Maybe it will jog some of those memories you've got locked up so tight. You alright? Looks different from how I remember. It's been a long time. You've got my number. If you need anything, give me a call. Other than that, see you in a couple days. Jillian? Yeah. Thank you. Good luck. Hey, you've reached Sara. Leave a message and I'll get back to you soon as possible. The serum intended to enhance the subject's psychic abilities has resulted in terrifying side effects. I can't be certain but it would appear the experiment has attracted some kind of. Right now I have more questions than answers. One certainty I have is that I. Some of his drawings suggest that these things have already made contact with him. I don't know if this is a glimpse... What did I say about playing with Dad's recording, you little monkey? If I let you go to work with Daddy, you promise to be good? Of course, he's going. He's my little helper. You hear that, Marcus? Your Dad wants you to help him. Marcus, give me the recording. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Marcus. Happy birthday to you. Quick, blow out the candles, son. Marcus? Down the hatch. Down the hatch. Fuck! Oh. Subject 142 has displayed remote viewing abilities far beyond anything I've ever seen before. Progress so far has been slow, too slow for my superiors as they are now insisting I introduce the newly-created serum. The psychic stimulator has yet to be tested successfully on... Two of my staff have been killed trying to subdue the subject. Unfortunately, our female military volunteer has suffered some kind of fatal side effect. Marcus is now the entity's only means of entering this world. I've hidden the last of my serum and destroyed all of my research. I can only pray that if they're here and if they can't successfully do it through 142, they will try to complete their transition to our world through my son. Lasting side effects. Marcus. Hello? Marcus. Dad? Marcus. Hello? Marcus? Marcus, are you in there? Sara? Yeah, it's me. Can you please open the door? What are you doing here? Well, let me in and I'll explain. How do I know you're really you? What? How do I know it's you? Marcus, this is fucking ridiculous. Just open the goddamn door. What did I get you for your last birthday? What did I get you? Fine, you bought me a terrible necklace with this bedazzled teddy bear on it and I hated it, but I wore it anyways because I loved you. Now, please open the door. Marcus! Jesus. You look like shit. What is this? Marcus, what's going on? Sara, what are you doing here? Didn't Dr. Martin call you? She thought it might be helpful for you to see a familiar face. She told you I was here? Yes, she explained everything to me. She's worried about you. And. So am I. All this time alone. What are you talking about? I got here yesterday. Marcus, you've been up here for a week. Hey. I'm here to help you. I wanna help you. Just. Let me in. So you found this in a box inside a hole in the woods? Yeah, okay. Well. What was it doing there? That was hidden on purpose. Okay, that was hidden there by my dad. How do you know that? I just do. You have no idea what this stuff is. I mean, it could be poisonous. You have no clue how even old this is. You didn't take any of this did you? Did you? That could be the key to finding out what happened to them. What happened to me. And anyone answer? Yes, someone answers! They just left me, Sara. I was a little boy and they just left me. What if I did something wrong? What if this is my fault? We have discussed this. It is not your fault. I see you still have a lot you need to work on. What do you think I'm doing here? You know what, this is. This is not the right setting for this. I should go. We will discuss this at a later time. Wait. Let me show you. It was here, it was right here. What was? It was a hatch. A hatch? Yeah, he led me here. Who did? My dad. Marcus, there's. There's nothing here. It was, it was here. Hey. Hey. It's okay, come on. Let's go home. Let's go home. What's wrong? Marcus, you okay? What's going on, just talk to me. Stop, what are you doing? Marcus, where are you going? What are you doing? Stop fucking around, Marcus. Marcus, come here and talk. Let's go home, please. Stop looking at me like that! Marcus, talk to me. Marcus! Stop! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Why did you do that? You just left me. Stop the bullshit, Marcus. I. You took some, didn't you? You lied to me! Answer me! Answer me! No, you answer me. What the fuck are you? Stop it, Marcus. You're scaring me. Good. I'm tired of being the only one around here who's scared. Come on. Ow! - Hey. - Ow! You're hurting me. Let go. Marcus, let go! Sara? No. Oh no. Oh, no. No. Oh. Oh. Sorry. Shh. Don't speak, don't speak. I'll get help, I'll get help. Ah, fuck. 911, what's your emergency? There's been an accident. Someone's been stabbed and they're losing a lot of blood. Please, come and help us. Ugh, that sounds terrible. Please hold. What the fuck? Thank you for waiting, sir. How can I be of assistance? She's been fucking stabbed, okay? Just get an ambulance out here as quick as you can. Please hold! What, you can't be fucking serious! Sara, hold on, hold on, hold on. Why do you keep putting me on hold? Is your friend still alive? Yes, but barely. Look, she's losing a lot of blood. Then I suggest you finish the job! What? Cut her throat, end her suffering. You can't save her now. What the fuck? Who the fuck is this? Please hold! Fuck! Do you still require medical assistance? Fuck you! Marcus? Marcus. Mom? I'm here. No, don't open the door. Just listen to my voice. You have to trust me. It will try and confuse you. Who are they? They need you, but you mustn't fall for their tricks. You must be strong. Mom, I'm so scared. Without you, they are nothing. Nothing is as it seems. Mom. They're coming for you, save yourself. I love you, darling. Mom. Marcus? â™ª I feel it, too â™ª â™ª Your kisses taste so sweet â™ª â™ª One look from you knocks me right off my â™ª â™ª I feel it, too â™ª â™ª Your kisses taste so sweet â™ª â™ª One look from you knocks me â™ª Sara? â™ª Right off my feet â™ª â™ª That's just love talking â™ª â™ª Your love talking to me â™ª â™ª Your love talking to me â™ª Sara? Sara. Marcus? I thought you were dead. - What? - I thought I killed you. I don't understand, I. What's going on, Marcus? I just. I wanna go home, I shouldn't have come here. I wanna go home. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. What the fuck? I'm so sorry. Jillian. Hey, you've reached Sara. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Sara? Sara, it's me. Things are bad, I need your help. I'm at my parents' cabin. I don't even know what's real or not anymore. Please, I need to know you're okay. I think I've done something terrible. Yes, someone answers! They just left me, Sara. I mean, I was a little boy and they just left me. What if I did something wrong? What if this is my fault? This isn't real. â™ª Sometime baby â™ª â™ª Middle of the night â™ª â™ª Don't have to tell you â™ª â™ª What feels just right â™ª â™ª That's just love talking â™ª â™ª My love talking to you â™ª â™ª I feel it, too â™ª â™ª Your kisses taste so sweet â™ª â™ª One look from you knocks me right off my feet â™ª What have you done to me? I'm trying to help you. Why can't I see? That's what we're trying to figure out. For now, please, try to relax. It's happening again. I'm so sorry. The time is approximately 11:43 PM. Unfortunately, subject 142 had to be terminated. I'm running out of subjects. â™ª Don't have to say hello â™ª â™ª Don't have to say goodbye â™ª Marcus, close the door! What is this a picture of, Marcus? I don't know. It's only the drawing. Who did? The man in my head. Never mention this to anyone, okay, son? I told you I didn't wanna be disturbed. I don't care what she said. I run this facility not her, and if you value your job you will keep her there. Under no circumstances do I want her down here. Do I make myself clear? Where is he? You take me to him right now. The nightmares. He's drawing the most horrific monsters. It's all you! Mary, you don't understand. Where is he? I can't. What have you been doing to him? Mary, stop. We have to continue his treatment. It's the only way to stop this. I can take care of him, I can. Let me go. I won't let you go. He needs this. Don't come any closer, I mean it. Oh, Mary. We don't have time for this. Please, put down the gun. Look at me. I would never do anything to hurt you or Marcus. I love you both. You know that? This doesn't make any sense, Andrew. Why? You have to trust me. They're coming for him. Enough, get out of my way. Just give me the gun. No, no! Oh, god, no! Mary! Oh! Marcus. Come here, son. It's okay. You're special, Marcus. Don't ever forget that. You remember our secret way out? The one I should you. You run as fast as you can and you never look back, okay? I love you, son. Now, go. Go! You can't take my boy! I have concocted a special formula in hopes that it will suppress Marcus's psychic abilities. My only hope is that this will be enough to sever the tie between him and the entities. Long enough for me to get him to safety. The serum could have long-lasting side effects on him mentally and could possibly lead to psychosis. I just need more time to perfect it, to make it more safe. But time's up and I can't think of any other solution. Since the termination of Subject 142, Marcus is now the entity's only means of entering this world. I've hidden the last of my serum and destroyed all of my research. I can only pray I've done enough to stop these things. Marcus. â™ª Don't have to say goodbye â™ª â™ª That's just love talking â™ª â™ª Don't have to say hello â™ª â™ª Don't have to say goodbye â™ª I'm not dead, it's the serum. It's making me see things. Just do as they ask and go home. They promised to let us go. They wanna help you. Please, if you love me just let them in. Now open your eyes to us, Marcus. It's a good painting. The pallet is somewhat rudimentary. And your use of shading leaves a lot to be desired. But the central figure, it's like looking in a mirror. Who are you? I'm you. Did the face not give it away? What? You're only half a man, Marcus. Stunted, cleft, pulled asunder. Your potential left abandoned in the woods. Pitiful. Always looking for the escape. Adversity is the first path to truth. What truth? That you feel hopeless, lost, confused. You exist in a state of abeyance, unwilling to express your true potency. You felt it once. No. You only deny yourself. You want to help us. You've always wanted to help us. Now open your eyes, Marcus. â™ª Don't have to tell you â™ª â™ª That's love talking to you and I â™ª What are you doing, baby? Let me help you. This isn't real. Of course, it's real. You left a message on my phone. Remember? That's why I'm here. So we can go home? Yes. We can go home. You mean together? Of course, sweetheart. Remember what we once had? You can have all of it. Just take my hand. Just let me in, Marcus, and then we can be together forever. You're so shit at this. Sara would never say that. We only want what's best for you, darling. We all do. Marcus, put down the knife. I die, you die. Fuck off! Marcus! Marcus, are you in there? Open the door! Come on, Marcus. Marcus, I got your message. Please open the door. Marcus, open the door! This isn't real. Now, open your eyes, Marcus. â™ª As I shock my heart asunder â™ª â™ª The darkness within breaks me under â™ª â™ª High and whisper silent screams â™ª â™ª Endless duality and patient filled dreams â™ª â™ª Fills through the air â™ª â™ª The light is pale â™ª â™ª And nothing's what it seems â™ª â™ª As I shock my heart asunder â™ª â™ª The darkness within breaks me under â™ª â™ª As you see my fragile mind â™ª â™ª You might wake the darkness, it makes me rise â™ª â™ª Can't escape this fate tearing off my face â™ª â™ª Sometime, baby â™ª â™ª In the middle of the night â™ª â™ª Don't have to tell you â™ª â™ª What feels just right â™ª â™ª That's just love talking â™ª â™ª My love talking to you â™ª â™ª I feel it, too â™ª â™ª Your kisses taste so sweet â™ª â™ª One look from you knocks me right off my feet â™ª â™ª That's just love talking â™ª
