Lesbians. Don't mind him, Marsya. Just ignore him. Learn to control yourself, Marsya. You can't keep holding on to your anger. What if someone dies? Then that person deserves it. Look, if you're still upset about your mother forcing you to learn martial arts... you can talk to her about it. You don't know what my mother is like. You're late again. Marsya, tomorrow morning before school, we're going practice and spar together. Mom, you want me to be skilled and kill people or killed just like Dad? Someday you'll understand. I will never understand. You keep telling me that I'll understand... but you don't tell me anything. Why are you forcing me to learn martial art? What did you say? Don't let her out of your sight, Bob. Sure. Sarah and Bianca will arrive in Jakarta this afternoon. They're coming from India. They already know that they are being tracked. I think it's the Mexican. Come on, why would you say that? I've been out the drug business for 10 years. You're never in the drug business. It's not you. It was your husband. Well, don't think too much about it, okay? The most important thing that you have to go out from this country as soon as possible, and fly to India. From there, we will find a safe place for you until you can get back to America. I'm not leaving Indonesia without Laura. Don't kill him. - Okay. Go. - Go! Go! Go! Let's go get her. Who are they, Mom? I knew this was going to happen. I've already prepared everything to keep us safe. Mom! Who are they? Dad's murderers? There's no time to explain. Get in, Marsya! Hurry! They are still alive Who are they? I don't know. We almost died. And all you can say is that you don’t know? I'm sure this has something to do with Dad. He's dead because of you, right? You're wrong. You're wrong about me. What then if that's not it? They tried to kill us! They were shooting at us! They're your enemies, right? It's true and you know it because you've prepared everything. You'll know later on. Well, of course I'll know. I'm involved now. Mom, what do they want from you? They followed me when I was on the streets. If they wanted me, they would've killed me already. But they didn't! They followed me until I got home, which means they want you! We'll see later. We'll see later? Mom, I need an answer now! I knew this was going to happen. Find the fuckers that trying to kill the, Robbin. Yeah, I will. I need to know who they are. You've been keeping too many secrets from me. This apartment is your dad's inheritance. Mom, I don't care about inheritance. I need an explanation. What I've been afraid of all this time is coming true. What do you mean, Marsya? My suspicion towards my mother. I was right all this time. So, what do you want now? Dig deeper into this. Sarah. Roy. She's okay, Roy. It's time. They're coming for us. Where are you? We're safe. I'll call you again in the morning and we'll meet up. Thank you, Roy. Whoa! I found them. I'll handle it. Don't worry. Yes, Paquita is out. All right, Oscar. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Marsya. Thalia. Get in! Let's go, Thalia! Get in the car! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Don't lose them! Are you okay? Wait in the car. Hey, you don't have to worry. I'll protect you girls. Thank you, Roy. It's hard for me to accept this condition. I feel sorry for Marsya. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Get inside! We have to go down! Come on, Thalia! Jump down now! Hurry up! Hey! You there! What's going on? My door is broken! Thalia, hurry up! Jump! What the fuck? Thalia! Hold on! Thalia, hurry up! Jump! Thank you, sir! - Go after them! - Yes, Captain! - Hold them off at the lobby! - Hold them off at the lobby! Marsya, get in the car! I have to go back, Mom. Thalia... Thalia isn't involved. They want you. They want me? You're the one with enemies. Why would they want me? I have to go back, Mom. You're in danger. They want to kill you. Lies. All lies! You're a liar! For me, Thalia is more important than a dumbass "mafia" mother like you. Fine. You can go. They're just going to kill you. I can only protect you as much as I can. I love you so much. Even though I'm not your real mother. The story was complicated. My husband sacrificed so much for this. I lost someone I loved so dearly. Wisnu. I don't want to lose you too. Let's find my daughter, then I'll kill the motherfucker myself. What about that woman? Do we need to kill her? I just want Laura. - Oscar. - Hmm. Life is about making mistakes, correct? A cup of coffee in the morning, walk on the scenes, crying under the moonlight, and smile under the sun. Life is beautiful. I don't want a mother and daughter from my past to ruin my beautiful life. There's so much pleasure that I've achieved. I'll become a minister soon, and after that, president. It's not hard to be an important person in this country. A country that is still searching for a system and form. A country that is biased about justice and crime. Am I right? Hmm? Everyone has their own destiny. I think God sent you to make me happy after I lost Wisnu. I love you so much and I don't want to lose you. I will protect my happiness with any means necessary. Maybe you think I'm a weird and mean mother. They're not coming. What do you mean? Your cop friends. Wisnu! What are you crazy? Oh, shit! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Wisnu, no! No! My daughter! No! My daughter! No! Don't shoot! My daughter! No! No! No! My daughter! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Your father was under cover. I mean Wisnu was under cover. But nobody knew about the little girl in my house when my husband died. Two years ago, I found out that you're Paquita and Oscar's daughter. In the past, your real father was involved in international drug and human trafficking. Now he's a politician in the government. And next month, Oscar will be a minister. I'm sorry, Mom. Roy, this country needs a brilliant minister like me. Someone who knows the ins and outs of the crime world. With my experience, I can make a sufficient system and new rules. Other politicians don't have the experience that I have, which means they know nothing. Got it? But do we have to kill Sarah and your own daughter, Oscar? Getting rid of Paquita should be enough. Life is cruel. Especially if we want big things in life. One thing for sure, I don’t want my past to mess with the career that I've built. Sacrifices are necessary. Get rid of anyone who can jeopardize this. Hi! How are you, darling? MEET US IN HARBOR BY ROY Oscar, everything is ready. Okay. Wait outside. Yeah. We are following her now. Don't lose her. My daughter. How are you? I know who you are. Naughty girl. You know. You're funny when you're angry. But tonight, all of you will die. I'm sorry, Paquita I have to kill you and your daughter, I'm not the bad guy. It's your husband, Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Hello, my sweet heart. Long time no see. I've made a plan to move you back to Mexico. But you made your own plan that kill yourself, my love. Do you have last words to say? Before I blow your head off, let me sing a song for you. Do you remember our song, my love? ♪ Listen, ♪ ♪ do you wanna know a secret? ♪ ♪ Will you promise not to tell ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, closer ♪ ♪ Let me whisper in your ear ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ This is the best family reunion ever!
