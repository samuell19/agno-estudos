Hey, let's make it, huh? All right, Ben. Here is the book you'll be needing for the course and take your seat as quietly as you can. Ha, ha. Papers. I couldn't get around the other way. Oh, go ahead, lady. Thanks. Aw. See? There I went and done it again. You mad at me? I mean, you're not mad at me, are you, lady? Man, this is better than TV. It was a pleasure to appear. We'll continue with the subjunctive. Jackie, you seem to be in good voice today. Suppose you stand and tell us all you know about the subjunctive. The subjunctive, Mr. Barzan. All you know about the subjunctive. Yeah, the uh, subjunctive there. Um. I don't, uh, I don't know anything about that Miss Ryan. I mean, like uh... I don't uh, I mean uh, like, that's all I know. I don't know anything. I don't see what's so funny. Ben, you're a new student. Let's see how much you know about the subjunctive. Oh, please, you know, don't ask me nothin' like that. Well, I come to find out. See, now you found out about me. I'm very stupid. I try, like, you know, I really try. But I just can't get it into my head and every time I can't get it into my head they kick me outta school. I just don't understand. Why don't you ask him how he spells his name? I bet he don't know that either. J-E-R-K, Ben Jerk! Now, wait a minute. All right, but no, I have... I have a problem. I'm a product of a very complex society and um, I'm having a real rough time making an adjustment, so um... All right, sit down. I said sit down, all of you! Now, you listen to me. I don't want to have an outburst like this ever again. Is that understood? Now, when you get here Monday, get in here on time. We'll start from the beginning. There'll be another quiz on the three pages you were supposed to have studied today. Ben, I'd like to speak to you after class. Sure. Class dismissed. Ben, I want you to understand this. I know all about you and your reform school background. I'm not holding it against you. Look, um, I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. Really, I'm very sorry, Miss... Miss Ryan. Miss Ryan. But I do want you to understand this. Lots of boys transfer here from other cities and walk into school with a chip on their shoulder, try to start trouble. It's no go. We know how to handle troublemakers. Now, sit up straight when I'm talking to you. Take that smirk off your face. Look, lady, I said I was sorry, didn't I? I said I was sorry. Look, how about you and I, maybe we can go out, have a beer, get acquainted, get to know each other? Get out of here. Sure. Sure. Hey, here he comes. Okay, give me the bit. Ah! Ah! All right, what's a subjunctive? Tell us what the subjunctive is, Mr. Barzan, or we'll break your arm! Please don't break my arm, prof! I'm a new student! You're breaking my lil' arm! Yeah! Hey, this is our big man. A real big man. Hey, that was a cool performance. Very entertaining. Right gang? Real big man. Yeah, we like you. You're stupid. This guy's a riot. Hey, Bennie boy! You made me drop my books. Sorry. Oh, now, what'd you do that for, Jackie? You're gonna have to excuse him. He gets kinda nervous. Here, let me give you a hand. Say goodbye to your public, Bennie boy! Oh, now, look, we've got him mussed up. We've got his pretty gray sweater all dirty. Come on, let's brush him off. Oh, now! Oh, I tore his sweater. Jackie, give him yours. I can't, it won't fit him. Hey, my girl's got a whole lot of sweaters. I know your girl. He couldn't fill it out. All right! All right. Which one of you creeps wants this in his gut, huh? Which one? Come on, which one? We didn't mean to get you mad, we just want to be your friends, Bennie. You wanna stick me? Okay. Give it to me in the back 'cause I can't look. He's gonna kill me, fellas. Stuey's gonna die! And right here in front of school, so touching. Get that thing out of my back. It isn't in yet. Leave him alone, fellas, leave him alone. You know, you're really very entertaining. We all know that you're a big man with a great big knife. Well, why don't you just put that thing away, we'll see what a real big man you are. 'Cause, you know, we don't go for violence and things like that, do we, fellas? Mm-mm. We just sort of like to gather together in the evenings and sip sodas and things like that. Where? Pat's Pig. You can't miss it, it's right around the corner from the police station. I'll be there. Hey, where you going? The school's over here. I'll bet you two to one he leaves town. I don't think so. He got guts. Hey, kid! Where do you think you're going? I was just trying to get hold of you. I wanted to tell you, we're in business. Oh, now that's bright, that's real bright. What? The man likes you. I like you. And we want to go on liking you. So don't push so hard, kid. Not so hard. And don't come out here again. I know the score, huh? Sure you do. That's why we picked you. You like money. We like your background. But you're not running the numbers anymore, kid. This is big time. I took the rap. Did I take the rap? Okay. Well, I can keep my mouth shut then. Okay. We like that, too. So you got your diploma. But it won't be no easy go in a reform school this time. You're dead. Okay, now what's the action? These kids, they're ripe. They're looking for kicks. I got a date with 'em tonight. You stink, man. You're supposed to peddle the stuff, not smoke it, so will you lay off? - I know the score! Lay off! I'm not a two year... I told you to lay off! Hey. Tell the man. Tell him he owes me for a sweater, huh? Where you going? Out. Oh, uh, pick up a six pack for me, will ya? "Pick up a six pack for me, will ya?" "Get my slippers, huh? "Clean up, huh?" Anything else you'd like? Look, can't you do anything around here? Look, you just worry about yourself, huh? You just take care of yourself. I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna make some money. Where you going? Look, don't worry about Bennie. Look at this. Would you look at this? Look at you. Look at the way you're dressed. You are a flunky and a nothing and that's all you'll ever be. That's all you'll ever be. Look at you. You're a mess! You stink! Here, take a look. Have a good look at you. Look! - Get that... - Go on and look! Get it away! Pop. Go on. Slop it up. Get outta here, you bum! Hey, hey, hey! Well! Well, hello, hello. Hello. Hey, like, what's this? Some people just don't trust anybody, do they, Stu?

Sorry, I'm sorry, you know. Come on, Stu, please! Jackie? Hey, it'll be my pleasure. Oh! Hey, hi, Ben! Hi, Ben. There, see, I didn't disappoint you. No. But where's your clown suit? "Where's your clown suit?" I thought maybe next week we'd all chip in and get team jackets. Fine. But right now why don't you entertain us? You know, you're the big man. Think of something big. Well, now, what would you like? Want me to beat up an old lady? Oh, no. That'd be too easy. You might win. Oh, that's funny. Well, how about if I pull a job? There's a supermarket right across the street. Oh, no, no, no. Something big. Something daring. Something big. Yeah, with imagination. Use your imagination. Okay. Okay! Hey, where you going? To jail. Hiya, dad. What's that? Can I help you, son? Yeah. See, uh, I'm a new kid in town and um, well, I'm a troublemaker so I thought I'd better report in, you know, before I cause any real trouble.

I don't know why, but that's just what he wanted. Oh, if he were my kid. What'd he say about being a butterfly? He said he wanted his wings blue. How do I know what the guy was saying, the jerk. I'm telling you, he takes this ink, see, and he dumps it all over the sarge's desk. The guy's bananas! He's bananas, I tell you. All over his desk, man? Yeah! Listen, would I snow you guys?

I like to blow the guys to some beer once in a while, you know? I guess they're just not used to it, that's all. Oh, they'd been drinking? I thought maybe they might have been. You too? I can handle it. My old man and I are great drinkers. Thanks. You know, when I was a kid, my old man used to throw a party and I used to sit right in with the gang and drink with them. So I'm used to it, see? That's why I kinda look out for the other guys. 'Cause they ain't got any constitution for it. Except Ben. He does okay. Which one was he? He's a neat guy. You gotta meet him. Yeah, Ben's okay, he can take care of himself. Except once in a while I gotta get him out of a scrape, when he's up against odds. He's a new guy. In fact, I got him out of a big scrape this afternoon. The guys were kinda riding him 'cause he's new, you know. Gee, I think that's just great. What? You know the way you have so many friends.

Great defender. You guys met the great defender? How's the little delinquent this morning? And all of his other little delinquents? Drinking Cokes. Now, isn't that nice? Lay off. Now, is that a nice way to talk? I'm sorry. You know, I'm really sorry. Look man, I mean, just because you wear a 30 dollar hat don't give you the right to push people around. Oh, he's hurt. Now, isn't that too bad? Mama's little boy doesn't like to be pushed around. You can, you know, push just so far. Look, punk. You see that mitt? Those are calluses. - Calluses. - All the way from here all the way up to the tips of the fingers. Wow. They're as hard as a board. And when I hit anybody with it, it hurts just like a board. Sometimes they bleed. Get off of my back! What's the matter? The thought of blood make you nervous? Your blood doesn't bother me a bit. I hear you kids like to dance. Now, who told you a thing like that? A fly. Fly? Oh. A fly with blue wings. Said you kids had quite a dance the other night. All over the top of some other kid's head. The kid's in the hospital. Got a real bad headache. How's yours? Um, this little fly, he didn't take any pictures, did he? Oh, no, he wouldn't even swear out a warrant. Very smart little fly. When are you coming to see us again, kid? You're a big deal, huh? You're a real big deal. What are you going to do to me? You gonna give me the electric chair? Is that what you're gonna do? Oh, no. No. No, we don't do it that way anymore. We do it with a pill. Just a little pill. And we drop it in a cup. And the gas comes up out of that cup and it fills your lungs and pretty soon you don't breathe anymore. Wow. You don't think he's wise, do you, Ben? What happens if this guy finds out? I mean, what are we gonna do? What do you think? Hey, what is with this finding out bit? I mean, let me in on it will you, before I pass out? This guy's giving me the creeps. I feel terrible. Let's have a party or something. A party? Wait a second. Hi, Jackie. Oh, hi, Amy, how are you? Aren't you gonna buy me a Coke? Oh, yeah. I'll see you later, huh? That kid's ruined. He's ruined. Ah, forget about him. Benny, I feel lousy. You got enough stuff? Sure. We'll have a party. Yeah, we'll have lots of parties. First we gotta get some money. Money? Yeah, money. This smoking habit's expensive. Real expensive. Get in. Okay, let's have it. What? The loot, man. Bread, let's have it. It's in the oven. I'll have it for you tonight. Tonight, huh? Bennie, you're through. What do you mean I'm through? I need more, just like we planned. Not like I planned, Bennie. I never thought you'd become a junky. I thought you were a smart boy. Oh, man, come on, I can take it or leave it alone. Oh, that's what they all say. Smell your clothes. You stink. Hey, quit the clowning. I mean, I need some more M. I need some more M now. By tonight those guys are gonna be screaming for it. Let 'em scream, Bennie, you're through. Get out. What'll I do? What am I gonna tell them? Tell them you're through. Now, get out. Get out! Yeah, I'll get out. I gotta talk to you. Please, Benny, I've got to talk to you. Oh man, later, huh? Like, later. No, before we go in, Bennie, now. Please, Bennie, I've got to talk to you now. - Oh, come on, man. - Bennie, I gotta talk. - Look, Bennie. - What? I got to have some more. I'm dying for it, I've got to have some more stuff. I'm dying... - Shoot, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, kid. Don't you trust me, Bennie? Don't you trust me? Look, man, man, hey. I don't trust my mother. Have a heart, Bennie. Look, I'll get the dough, I'll get the dough. I gotta have some more of the stuff, I'm down, pick me up. I don't want to be late for class, huh? Wait. Get a job. Steal something. Whatcha say, Cook? Well, I trust you've all had a busy weekend. I've been reading about it in the newspapers. Or am I misjudging some of you? Now to the unpleasant business of the English language. This afternoon, since you're using street dialect, I'm gonna try to be a great guy! I'm going to call for volunteers. Now, the subjunctive mood. Can just one of you stand and define the subjunctive mood? In any language he chooses. Jackie, will you turn around and wake up your friend? Hey, Cook! Hey! Cookie. Come on, wake up. Come on, get up. Spend the evening in the pool room, Charles? Uh, I don't know. I just don't know. Cookie, if you're so tired, why did you bother to come to school today? That's a good question. Look for me tomorrow. Hey, teach, talk like us again 'cause you're a real scream. Stop it, all of you. Well, what do you want, Ben? You want to know about this uh, subjunctive mood, don't you? That's right. Well, I thought I'd give it a try. Now, you check me if I'm wrong. The subjunctive mood represents something that isn't actually in the domain of reality. It's uh, existent only in the mid of a speaker with more or less hope of realization or in the case of a statement, with little or no hope. Hey, Bennie. I don't know what you said in there, but whatever you said, man, that was the greatest. I mean, where did you learn that, huh? I studied. That's cool. She is a dumb broad. You're telling me. Where you been, sheriff? I missed you. You won't say nothing, huh? - Ah, I... - You won't tell the guys? - No. - You'll keep it to yourself? Yes. I uh, I got a girl. You got a girl? Yeah, she likes me. And her folks like me because they invited me for supper. In fact, I went to church Sunday, that's why... You went to church on Sunday? I spent the whole day with them. Don't tell the guys, huh? I'm not gonna tell the guys. Sure? Hey, you sure put old lady Ryan in her place, man. Listen, that was the greatest, that was the best I ever heard. She is stupid. She's... You're telling me. Come on, let's go. Jackie, have you got a second? Sure. I'll be right with you, Benny, just a minute. Where you gonna be? Come on, come on. Yeah, what's happening? What? You want to be my pal? I'm your pal. What is this? Put that, hide it! But look, I'm gonna pull a job. I want to rob a gas station. A job? What, did you flip the lid or something? I gotta have some money, Jackie. I gotta have some money, okay? Is that all you want? Money? What is with you? There, dollar fifty, dollar sixty-seven. There, that's 16 beers. - Go on, take it. - Jackie, Jackie... Take the money. You don't understand I'm on... On what? The smoke. Wow. What's it like? It's bad, Jackie, it's really bad. I don't want the stuff, but I gotta have it. My insides are falling out, Jackie. I'm falling apart. Ask Bennie, he'll tell you what it's like. Ask Bennie? What's Bennie got to do with this? Look, look, are you gonna be my pal? Are you gonna help me? Bennie? You mean that Bennie was... Yeah, look, see, he knew a guy that had the stuff and you're gonna help me, you're gonna be my pal. Bennie? Please. Okay, okay, look, go to a movie or something and I'll speak to Bennie for you, okay? You don't speak to Ben. You feed him dough. Okay, look, go home, take a shower, and I'll try to get some money. I'm your pal, see? I'll get the money somehow and I'll met you tonight at Pat's, okay? Where are you gonna get any money? Hey. Do like I tell ya. Where you going, Jackie? Don't you want some more coffee? No. No, I got a stomachache. I feel real sick, Amy. Can I get you something? Yeah, I think I'll go down to Pat's and get a bromo. I'll see you, huh? I'll see you later. A bromo, that's what I need, a bromo. I'll see ya. Hey, Marty, you seen Cookie around? No, man. Hey, Stu, you seen Cookie? No. You sure you ain't seen him? 'Cause I gotta find him, man. What's bugging you? Nothing, I just gotta find Cookie. What have you got there? Nothing. I got nothing there. Come on, lover boy, what've you got there? I got nothing! Come on, would you, Stu? Hey! Hey, look at this. Come on, give me that. No, I think this is delicate. Real delicate. Come on, Stu... What is it? I don't know, but I think it's too large to be an engagement ring. Come on, Stu, that's real valuable. Now, give it back, will you please, huh? Come on. - This piece of junk? - Yeah, come on. Hey, come on! Would you guys give me that! Must be work at least one million. Or maybe two million. What'd I do? It's broke. You broke it. Jackie! Jackie! Coffee? Oh, Jackie, why? I don't know. I mean, I just don't know. You don't know. Don't you know what you've done? I had to, Amy, I had to! You don't know what it's like. You don't know, you don't know what it's like when you're on it. On what? On the smoke, that's what. It's the worst, Amy. It's the worst. And when you're hooked, you're hooked. Jackie, you're a liar. And a thief. Hey, lover boy, where's Ben? I don't know. Lay off, will ya? Where's Ben? Lay off, will ya? Man, if he doesn't get here soon, I'm gonna flip. Oh, I'll kill him. Bennie! Bennie! There's somebody here to see ya. Lay off. Well, welcome home. Why don't you run out and get me an ice cream cone? Sit down, kid. Vanilla. Sit down. I'll pay for it. I said sit down! Sit down. How's school? School is wild. I got bad news for you, Ben. Your friend Charlie Tyler is dead. He got killed trying to hold up a filling station. Oh, that's rough. That's real rough. Who's he? You don't know him? Let's see, I know a lot of Charlies. I don't know. Well, this one goes to school with you. The kids call him Cookie. So what? He mentioned your name before he died. That is very, very touching. There's another thing we can't quite figure out. What does the letter M stand for? He kept mumbling, M, M. M. Mother. Isn't that nice, he was thinking of his mother? Look, what do you keep bugging me for? I didn't kill that fink! I didn't shoot him. No. No, you didn't shoot him. Well, we just thought you might know something, that's all! Sure. I don't know anything. Okay, take him on home. Oh, lay off of me. Myers. Yes, sir? Stick with him. I want to know every place he goes, everybody he talks to. What's the charge? Narcotics. M don't stand for mother. Marijuana. Drive safely. Wow! What are you doing here? I'm in a jam, Bennie, I need your help. Oh, look, man, later, huh? I gotta, no, later. But you don't understand, Bennie, listen. You don't understand, you gotta help me, Bennie, before the cops find out. Cops? Yeah. Man, what are... Come inside, man. Come inside, I want to talk to you. Hey, where's your folks? Nobody's home. All right, what's the big emergency? I'm in a spot, Bennie, I gotta have a couple hundred bucks real fast. Oh, is that all? For a minute there I thought, I thought maybe it was something important. Ah, gee, that's great. I knew I could count on you. Look, maybe you need more. How about a grand, huh? Can I give you a grand? Oh, no, just a couple of hundred. I mean, just a loan, Ben, I'll pay you back. Oh, no, kid, no. Gee, you're my pal. I'll give it to you. What do you take me for? Hey, take it easy, Ben. Ben! Ah! Don't con me. Don't con me, don't con me, that's it. Don't con me, I don't like to be conned. Not by you or anybody. Don't con me, buster! Please, Ben, I'm your pal. You're my pal? You're my pal, huh? Don't con me. You trying to shake me down? Is that what you're doing? You trying to shake me down? No, Ben, let me explain will you? Come on, explain. Come on, explain. Yeah, well, see, I had to have this money, see? It's for my girl, man. So her folks won't find out. Find out about what? Well, see, she had this antique, see, and I had to have this money and... Well, I heard the antique was worth a lot of money, so I swiped it and it got broke. See, the antique got broke, Ben. What does she know about me? What does she know about me? Nothing! I didn't tell her nothing. These G-Men, but they come to my house, these cops. What did you tell them? What's going on, what did you tell them? What did she tell them? Nothing. I told her it was me, Ben. I told her I was on it. On what? On what? You know, Ben. You understand. - Oh. - But she don't. She don't understand, Ben. I mean, she got nothing to worry about. See, I needed the money and I took it and, and it broke, Ben. The antique... I had to have it! My pal, huh? My pal. Stop crying! I had to do it. I had to do it for Cookie. Cookie's dead, Cookie's dead! Cookie ain't dead, Ben. I oughta kill you. I'm sorry, Bennie. I didn't mean to tell her. I'm sorry. Sure you're sorry. Everybody's always sorry. Sorry! Oh, please, God. Hey! Hey, Eddie! Hey, Eddie! Hey, Eddie! I told you never to come here. Now, take off. You'd have been real proud of me. You would have been real proud of me. Take off, will ya? Those cops, they tried everything. They tried everything. But I had them liking me. I had 'em liking me, you would've been real proud. Get inside. I had them. I had them right in the palm of my hand. They all liked me. They all liked me, can you beat that? They all liked me. You'd better tell me what happened. And then. And it all caved in. It all caved in, like... London Bridge is falling down. London Bridge is falling down! Seashells. Seashells. Seashells by the seashore. You can hear the wind. You can hear everything if you listen. Will you snap out of it and tell me what happened? Don't hit me! Don't hit me! Don't hit me, Pop. You're crazy. You're crazy. Don't hit me. You're crazy! No, no, no. No, it's like we said, you told me. You said, you said a couple of bucks in a palm here and a couple of bucks in a palm there and then everything is okay. You buy anything with money, that's what you said. You're gonna fix it for me, huh? No, Ben. Well, I... Uh.. Well, if I'm a good boy, I get a blue star. Look, kid, it's okay. I'll fix it. I'll take care of everything. Now, why don't you go on home like a good kid? Oh, everybody's a phony, everybody's a phony. You're a liar! Now, look, what kind of a guy you think I am? Hey, I'm not gonna cause any trouble. I know that, Ben. Now, go on home. Now, why would I do a thing like that? I'm not gonna cause any trouble. You know that, right? Go on home. Hey! Hey, Jackie boy. You been necking on a bumpy road? Lay off, will you? Oh, now Jackie's gone and got hurt. Ain't that too bad? Bug out, will ya? Cookie's dead. - You're kidding! - What? Cops shot him. He wanted money. Well, he won't need it anymore. You guys... You can't wait to go back into the woodwork. Jackie, it's for you. Hello? I want to talk to you. You listening to me? Then you're really not mad at me anymore, huh, Benny? How could I be mad at you. Listen, now, I want to talk to you and I want to talk to your girl, huh? Well, it's kinda late, Ben, I mean... Listen, Jackie. I need some help. Where will we meet you? Okay. Okay, Bennie. Uh, yeah, we'll be there as soon as we can. Hey, hey. Where you going, buddy boy? To see Bennie. We're going with you. You can't. It's private. Hey! I said we're going with you. Now, you birds stay here. Come on, Marty. We'll wait for you, Stu. Amy! Hey, Amy! Jackie. Hi. What do you want? I want to talk to you, Amy. Look, Jackie, haven't you caused me enough... Oh, Jackie, what happened to you? Your face, your clothes. Nothing, it's all dried now. Who did it? Why? I don't know. Amy, look, you gotta help me. Ben wants to talk to us. Look, Jackie, it's late. Please go home, huh? Gee. You know what this is, Amy? This is dope. This is a stick, this is marijuana, and this is what killed Cookie. Cookie Tyler? Cookie's dead. And I don't know what to do, Amy, 'cause I think maybe it's my fault. Your fault? No. No, it's not your fault, it's their fault. Jackie, they're bad. You call them your friends, but they're bad. Jackie, you're not like them. I know you're a little crazy, but, but nice crazy. And you're a terrible liar. You know, Amy, I like you. I really like you. I like you, too, Jackie. That's why you gotta come with me. You gotta come with me to help Ben. Look, it won't take long, Amy, only a few minutes. Please? Please, Amy? Okay. I'll go get my sweater. He's in there, Lieutenant. Get in there. Find out who he's with and bring him to the station. Yes, sir. Jackie, I don't like this. Please, let's go home. We can talk to him tomorrow. I can't, Amy, I promised Ben. Besides, he needs me and he wants to talk to us. Oh, Jackie, you know I don't like those guys. Forget them, will you, Amy? They want to see Ben, too. Oh, cut it out! You're making me sick. There's nothing wrong with you that seeing Ben won't cure. What's that crazy guy doing? It's Ben! He thinks we're two motorcycle cops! Hang on! Bennie! Hurry, Bennie! Bennie! No, no! Radio the fire department. Bennie! Bennie, she wasn't gonna tell! Bennie! Bennie! Get outta here! You can't help him now. That thing's liable to blow up at any minute. Bennie! Bennie! Bennie, Bennie! Let me go, I can still save him! Bennie! Let me get Bennie! You came close, son. But you were lucky. As for you two, take a good look. Bennie! Everything's gonna be all right 'cause Bennie's dead. Come on now, look at this. Come on, son, look at it. Take a good look. It could have been any one of you. Is this what you call kicks? Well, if you don't wise up, you're all gonna wind up like this one way or the other. Get in the car. Lieutenant, we got the big guy, the pusher. He's dead. There'll be another one. There'll be another.
