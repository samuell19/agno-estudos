BECOMING A SHERIFF WAS THE FIRST GOOD THING TO COME MY WAY-- A PRETTY LAID-BACK JOB JUST OUTSIDE OF COLBY UNIVERSITY IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE UNIVERSITY BEING THE PRIMARY MONEY TREE AND ACADEMIC PLAYGROUND... FOR THE OFFSPRING OF THE RICH AND POWERFUL. NOTHING THAT REQUIRED ANY REAL POLICE WORK. MOSTLY FRAT PARTIES, NOISE COMPLAINTS AND AN OCCASIONAL DUI. AT LEAST THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS UNTIL I GOT THAT CALL FROM DEAN COMYN. WE'VE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH ONE OF OUR STUDENTS HERE. OVERDOSE. ISN'T THAT A MEDICAL PROBLEM ? HER MOTHER SEEMS TO FEEL THAT IT'S CRIMINAL. I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OUR POSITION HERE. THIS THING DOES HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED. SENSITIVELY. DELICATELY. RIGHT. LIKE OLD SHERIFF PERKINS WOULD HAVE DONE. [ Laughing ] WELL. I'M SURE THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THE TOWN COUNCIL... TO NAME A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT, I'LL BE ABLE TO REPORT WHAT A FINE JOB YOU HAVE DONE AS ACTING SHERIFF... FOR US. YOU GODDAMNED RICH GIRLS. YOU THINK YOU OWN THE WORLD. 'CAUSE WHENEVER YOU MESS UP, YOUR DADDY JUST WRITES A CHECK. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOUR DAUGHTER. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, MRS. CAMPBELL. YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ? YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID ? ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH. THIS BITCH TRIED TO KILL MY DAUGHTER. SHE'S LYING IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE CAN'T TALK. SHE CAN'T MOVE. SHE CAN'T EVEN OPEN HER LITTLE EYES. [ Sheriff ] ALICIA'S HER ONLY CHILD, SO-- BUT SHE'S ACTING LIKE IT'S ALL OUR FAULT. SHE WAS OUR FRIEND. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE. OKAY, WELL-- WHY DON'T Y'ALL JUST TELL ME WHAT, UH, WHAT HAPPENED. WE WERE HAVING A PARTY, AND ALICIA WAS DRINKING. SHE WAS SO LOADED. SHE WANTED TO GET HIGH. OOPS. IT'S-- IT'S ALL RIGHT. I AIN'T GOING TO BUST Y'ALL. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WENT DOWN. LIKE I WAS SAYING, SHE WANTED TO DO SOME COKE. [ Woman ] AND, UM, I REMEMBER HEARING SOMEONE DOWNSTAIRS MAKING A LOT OF NOISE. SHE WAS JONESIN', AND SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS STUFF HIDDEN IN THE GUEST ROOM. SHE WAS TEARING THE ROOM APART. SHE COULDN'T FIND ANY, SO I LEFT. UH, WHAT TIME WAS THIS ? A LITTLE BEFORE 2:00. OKAY. GO ON. THE PARTY HAD BROKEN UP, AND HADS AND I WERE UPSTAIRS CLEANING UP. SHE WENT TO BED, AND I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. AND I HEARD THIS-- THIS CRASH. WHEN ? I DON'T KNOW. 2:15, MAYBE. AND I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM AND I FOUND HER, AND-- I YELLED UP TO HADLEY TO CALL STUDENT HEALTH. HADLEY ! AND I TRIED TO GIVE HER MOUTH-TO-MOUTH AND I TRIED TO REVIVE HER, BUT-- [ Sniffling ] I JUST, UM-- I COULDN'T. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL 911 ? WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE-- BECAUSE STUDENT HEALTH IS... DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE, AND THEY HAVE A DOCTOR ON CALL 24 HOURS. SO, WE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET HELP... FASTER. UH-HUH. OKAY. WELL, UH-- I GUESS I JUST NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCENE. MULTICOLORED PAPER. I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. Y'ALL DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING IN HERE, NOW, DID YOU ? MOVE ANYTHING AROUND ? NO. WHAT'S IN THERE ? THE LIBRARY-- ALICIA'S ROOM. SHE KIND OF MOVED IN ON US. UM-- ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I'LL CALL Y'ALL IF, UH, IF I NEED ANYTHING ELSE. ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY. WE DON'T ALLOW FLOWERS IN ICU.

FUCK YOU. LISTEN, I'M NOT INTO THIS THING WITH US. OH, REALLY ? YOU COULD'VE FOOLED ME. WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND TREVOR ? I'M SURE HE'S MISSED HAVING TO FIGHT YOU OFF THE LAST FIVE MINUTES. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY ? [ Sheriff ] SO YOU WERE UPSET. WHY WOULD I BE UPSET ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME. TELL YOU WHAT ? ABOUT YOU AND ALICIA. YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND. WHY ? 'CAUSE I'M A COP ? BECAUSE YOU'RE A GUY. THIS IS HOW YOU'RE LEAVING MY STUDENTS ALONE ? BY SEXUALLY HARASSING THEM ? WHAT ? I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR LITTLE PANTY RAID AT THE GIRLS' HOUSE. GODDAMN IT ! I DID NOT TOUCH THOSE GIRLS. POSSIBLY I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU... HOW THINGS WORK AROUND HERE. YOU MADE IT CLEAR, BUT I AM INVESTIGATING A CRIME. AN ACCIDENT. SLIPPING SOMEBODY PHARMACEUTICAL COCAINE AND ATTEMPTED MURDER-- THOSE ARE NOT ACCIDENTS, SIR. MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT I ASKED THE TOWN COUNCIL... TO START INTERVIEWING OTHER CANDIDATES FOR THE POSITION OF SHERIFF. [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ Boys Shouting, Indistinct ] HOW YOU DOIN', JOANIE ? HEY. ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THIS. ANYTIME. [ Object Shattering ] [ Coughing, Gagging ] [ Coughs ] YOU THINK I'M A FREAK ? [ Sniffling ] [ Water Runs ] [ Sniffling ] [ Coughs ] I DID THAT... FOR FIVE YEARS. UNTIL ALL THESE WHITE BUMPS... GREW ALL OVER MY FACE AND BODY. AND WHEN YOU'RE READY, I CAN HELP YOU STOP. NO ONE CAN HELP ME. [ Sniffles ] EVERY TIME I DO IT, I THINK IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST. IT NEVER IS. I'M JUST A BIG FAT LOSER. [ Sighs ] FAT. [ Sniffling ] JULIANNE. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, AND YOU'RE SMART. [ Scoffs ] AND YOUR DAD PROBABLY SAID YOU WERE FAT... JUST LIKE MINE DID. [ Shattering ] I'M GONNA GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT. THE STUFF ALICIA WAS DOING YOU CAN ONLY GET WITH A PRESCRIPTION. AND MY FATHER JUST HAPPENS TO BE A PHARMACIST. HEY, DAD, WE'RE HAVING A COKE PARTY TONIGHT, AND I REALLY WANNA FRY ONE OF MY FRIENDS. REALLY, POP ? YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU THINK ALICIA'S THE VIRGIN MARY. SHE'S A FUCKIN' LIAR. WE WERE GETTING TIRED OF KEEPING TRACK OF HER. YOU GUYS WON'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED. WANT TO CELEBRATE ? I DON'T KNOW. LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS. IT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT. MAX'S SHIT, YOU HAVE TO DO A WHOLE GRAM IN EACH NOSTRIL TO EVEN GET A BUZZ. WE ARE CELEBRATING HERE, AREN'T WE ? WE MOST CERTAINLY ARE. [ Laughing ] HERE SHE GOES. [ Snorting ] YOO-HOO ! [ Hawking ] [ Laughing ] [ Phone Rings ] OH. HELLO. OH, YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE. HOLD ON. ALICIA, HERE. HELLO. HI ! HOW ARE YOU ? I'M FINE. OKAY. NO. OH, MY GOD. I AM SO-- EXCITED. [ Laughing ] YES ! TOTALLY EXCITED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE. WHOO ! HEY, WHAT'S UP, ALICIA ? [ Laughing ] THEN SHE TOOK OFF AGAIN. SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS OR WHAT IT WAS ABOUT ? JUST THAT IT WAS A GUY. DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYONE I KNEW. BUT AFTER SHE TALKED TO HIM, SHE DISAPPEARED FOR A FEW DAYS. AND LAST NIGHT, SHE SHOWS UP AT OUR PARTY TOTALLY WASTED. ** [ Rave ] HEY, YOU GUYS. LOOK. [ Laughing ] SHOULD NOT. [ Man ] WHAT A TART. I'M GOING TO HELP HADS. ** [ Woman Vocalizing ] HOLD THIS. OH, SHIT. I DON'T KNOW. YOU THINK WE SHOULD TELL JULES ? NOT UNTIL WE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL. LET'S GO. [ Jules ] SHE'S NOT WORTH IT. HOW AM I GONNA HAVE FUN WITH HER HERE ? HEY, GUYS. OH, JULES, GUESS WHAT WE JUST-- [ Sighs ] SHE IS SO UNBELIEVABLE. I KNEW SHE-- WHATEVER. UH, ALICIA, I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. HERE, LET ME MAKE IT EASY ON YOU. HADLEY SLEPT WITH WARREN, YOU KNOW ? REALLY ? YEAH. ALL YOUR BULLSHIT ABOUT ALICIA AND ME, AND YOU FUCKED WARREN ? COME ON. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS ALONE, OKAY ? NO. NO, NOT IF YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH. SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM. [ Woman ] CHECK IT OUT. CHECK IT OUT. WHERE'S ALICIA ? [ Moaning ] [ Panting ] [ Laughing ] ALL THAT TIME, WE THOUGHT IT WAS TREVOR SHE WAS AFTER, BUT APPARENTLY SHE HAD HER EYE ON WARREN. AND YOU FORGAVE HER FOR THAT. NO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DIDN'T. WELL, YOU REALIZE THAT'S A MOTIVE. REALLY ? THEN WHY DIDN'T I TRY TO KILL HADLEY ? SHE FUCKED HIM TOO. I MEAN, IF I WENT AFTER EVERY GIRL WARREN FUCKED, YOU'D HAVE A CAMPUS LITTERED WITH DEAD BODIES. [ Chuckles ] ** [ Blues ] HEY. YOU, UH, YOU USUALLY GET A LOT OF COLLEGE KIDS IN HERE ? WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ? THE WAY THESE KIDS DRINK, I'M MAKING A FORTUNE JUST OFF THE FUCKING TIPS. UH, BUT WE CARD EVERYBODY. THEY GOT TO HAVE TWO PIECES OF I.D. I DON'T SERVE UNDERAGE IN HERE. DID YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO ALICIA CAMPBELL ? YEAH. SHE WAS IN HERE A COUPLE OF NIGHTS BEFORE IT HAPPENED. I THREW HER OUT, THOUGH. SHE AND THIS BLOND CHICK WERE HAVING A PIER SIX BRAWL. BLOND CHICK ? SHE'S ABOUT 5'6", SPLINT ON HER ARM ? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ABOUT ? IT SOUNDED LIKE A GUY. [ Shouting, Indistinct ] TAKE IT OUTSIDE ! OUTSIDE ! AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ABOUT ? YOU REMEMBER HEARING ANY NAMES ? WARREN ? TREVOR ? NO. I TOLD YOU, JUST SOME GUY. ALL RIGHT. [ Alicia ] ALL PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THEIR EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ONE USES THE GIFTS ONE IS GIVEN... TO BARGAIN AND NEGOTIATE FOR A PLACE IN SOCIETY. WAS THAT OKAY, WARREN ? WAS THAT OKAY ? WAS THAT OKAY, WARREN ? WAS THAT OKAY ? [ Tape Audio Cutting In And Out] [ Hadley ] TO BLEND IN AND FOLLOW. [ Alicia ] WAS THAT OKAY, WARREN ? WAS THAT OKAY ? SHOULD I DO THAT AGAIN ? THIS AIN'T REALLY YOUR STYLE, IS IT ? YOU GO TO SCHOOL, AND, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, THEY ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO HAND SOMETHING IN. [ Laughing, Chattering ] "LEAD, FOLLOW, OR GET OUT OF THE WAY: "A SOCIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF POOR CHILDREN... "PLACED IN A PRIVILEGED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT... AND RICH KIDS THRUST INTO THE DEPRIVED STUDENTS' WORLD." AFTER AN INITIAL PERIOD OF REBELLION, THE POOR STUDENT DISCOVERS HIS SUCCESS IN THE RICH KIDS' ENVIRONMENT... COMES FROM HIS ABILITY TO BLEND IN, TO FOLLOW. THE OLD MAN WHO LIVED IN THE OLD HOUSE, HE JUMPED ON HIS HOUSE-- [ Alicia ] BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE CHILDREN, THE ONES CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE ? LIKE THE MIDDLE CLASS THEY WILL GROW UP TO BE, THEY SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED. THEY'RE SIMPLY CONTENT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. I SAID IT. OKAY. OKAY, I GET IT. SO ALICIA IS THE POOR KID, RIGHT, WHO WAS ALLOWED TO HANG OUT, PLAY WITH RICH KIDS. THEY DIDN'T WANT HER TO LEAD. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO FOLLOW. SO SOMEONE HAD TO GET HER OUT OF THE WAY. YOU NEED A VACATION. SO, HOW'D IT FEEL, WARREN, HUH ? FUCKING HADLEY-- WAS IT WORTH ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT IT CAUSED ? ARE YOU KIDDING ? IT LET ME FULFILL A FANTASY. HADLEY GOT THE BEST BONING OF HER LIFE. SID GOT TO WATCH. WHERE DOES ALICIA FIT INTO ALL THIS ? SHE DIDN'T, OTHER THAN TELLING JULES AND TREVOR ABOUT IT. WELL, WHY DID ALICIA TELL IF SIDNEY WAS THE ONE WHO SAW IT ? IF I GAVE A SHIT AND WAS WILLING TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR THREE SECONDS, I'D SAY BECAUSE ALICIA HAD MORE TO GAIN. [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ Hadley ] YOU'RE REALLY FUCKING PARANOID. [ Alicia ] I'M PARANOID ? [ Indistinct ] ...A GIRL WHO REALLY DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HERSELF. [ Message Machine Beeps ] [ Man ] HI, HONEY. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY, BUT I'M HAVING A MEETING IN ATLANTA TOMORROW. I COULD COME DOWN EARLY AND MEET YOU FOR DINNER TONIGHT. SAY, 7:30, THE LAWRENCEVILLE INN. BYE-BYE. [ Message Machine Beeps ] [ Machine Voice ] MESSAGE DELETED. [ Beeps ] ** [ Piano ] [ Chattering ] HI. MR. ASHTON ? YES. I'M ALICIA CAMPBELL, A FRIEND OF HADLEY'S. AH, I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US. UM, WHERE IS HADLEY ? UM, SHE'S NOT COMING. SHE'S FINISHING UP AN INTERVIEW FOR OUR SOC PROJECT, SIR. YEAH. ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T GIVE HER YOUR MESSAGE. EXCUSE ME ? THE DISCIPLINE YOU'VE ENFORCED ON HER IS WORKING SO WELL, SIR. AND BECAUSE SHE'S STUDYING AND SHE'S WORKING HARD AND NOT DRINKING SO MUCH-- AND I KNOW IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO GET INVOLVED-- BUT I THINK IF SHE WERE TO SEE YOU NOW, SHE WOULD JUST LOSE COMPLETE FOCUS. [ Deep Breath ] [ Sighs ] REALLY. ARE YOU SURE ? I AM, SIR. HAVE A SEAT. WOULD YOU LIKE A COCKTAIL OR A GLASS OF WINE ? UM, OKAY. UH, I'LL HAVE... A CLUB SODA. CLUB SODA. I'LL HAVE ANOTHER ONE. GREAT. YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY MIGHT BE A GOOD INFLUENCE ON HER. [ Beeping ] [ Breathing ] [ Mr. Ashton ] YOU REALLY MIGHT BE A GOOD INFLUENCE ON HER. [ Shoes Clattering ] [ Coughing, Gagging ] [ Sheriff ] MULTICOLORED PAPER. [ Snorting ] [ Mr. Ashton ] YOU REALLY MIGHT BE A GOOD INFLUENCE ON HER. [ Loud Clank ] [ Monitor Beeping Rapidly ] [ Woman ] PRESSURE ! [ Woman ] ALL RIGHT. [ Woman 2 ] IT'S FALLING ! [ Man ] SOMEBODY GET HER OUT OF HERE. [ Woman ] YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE. [ Overlapping Dialogue ] [ Woman ] WE GOT A FLAT LINE ! ASYSTOLIC ! CODE BLUE ! ALICIA. WE WERE ABLE TO STABILIZE HER, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH HER THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW, MRS. CAMPBELL. YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND GET SOME REST. [ Sniffles ] [ Dean Comyn ] I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OUR POSITION HERE. THIS THING DOES HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED. SENSITIVELY. DELICATELY. YOU THINK THAT ALICIA'S JUST THIS LITTLE INNOCENT VIRGIN WE CORRUPTED. SHE'S NOTHING LIKE SHE SEEMS. [ Velcro Strap Unfastens ] YOU THINK ALICIA'S THE VIRGIN MARY. SHE'S A FUCKING LIAR. WHEN THEY WHEELED HER IN, SHE STILL HAD SOME CRUSTED ON HER NOSTRILS. THEY TOOK A SWAB OF THAT. PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY. 100 PERCENT PURE. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALICIA WENT FROM BEING A TOTAL STRANGER, TO BEING YOUR BEST FRIEND, TO LYIN' IN THE HOSPITAL WITH TUBES RUNNIN' IN AND OUT OF HER. SOMETIMES BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE. [ Sheriff Narrating ] SEE, SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA DO WHAT'S RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T NOT. [ Seagulls Crying ] NOW, IT MAY COST ME MY JOB, BUT THERE'S NO WAY ALICIA KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TAKING. COME ON NOW, MAN. DO THE RIGHT THING. [ Rapping ] * YOU LAUGHING AT ME THAT'S OKAY * [ Trevor Narrating ] ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS SOME PRETTY WEIRD SHIT IN THE AIR THAT NIGHT. HADLEY AND I WEREN'T GETTING ALONG, AND I WAS SICK OF GETTING WASTED. NICE SPIT TO THE BEAT BOX. NICE SPIT TO THE BEAT BOX. I'M FEELING REALLY OUT OF PLACE HERE TONIGHT. [ Laughing ] I KNOW. ME TOO. [ Chattering ] I HAD A LOT OF FUN DANCING WITH YOU. YEAH. * MC HAMMER UP MY NOSE * BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I STILL GET ALL THE HOS ** YOU JUST GOTTA BE CAREFUL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND WATCH OUT. STAY SWEET. [ Rapping Continues ] [ Trevor Narrating ] SEE, HADLEY DIDN'T LIKE IT IF SHE WASN'T THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. [ Rapping ] [ Chattering ] [ Sid ] HEY, HADLEY. YOU'RE NOT WALKING SO GOOD. [ Woman Laughing ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? HEY ! HEY, TREVOR. HADLEY ! WATCH THIS. [ Jules ] WHERE YOU GOIN' ? [ Sid ] HADLEY ! [ Jules ] HADLEY ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? YOU'RE A NUT ! MISS HADLEY. [ Squealing ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? HADLEY ! [ Screaming ] HADLEY ! YOU'VE HAD A VERY SEVERE CONCUSSION. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP YOU HERE TO RUN SOME TESTS. NO, I'M NOT STAYING HERE. YES, YOU ARE. HEY. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, GIVE ME A HOLLER. [ Trevor ] IS EVERYTHING OKAY ? THAT'S ALL I KNOW. ALL RIGHT. LOOK ALIVE. I'M GONNA NEED THIS FROM YOU-- AN INVENTORY FROM THE HOSPITAL. GIVE ME THE NAME OF THE ORDERLY THAT WAS ON DUTY THE DAY HADLEY WAS THERE. PETEY, I'M GONNA NEED A LAB TEST, SEARCH WARRANT. [ Hadley ] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN THIS CANDLELIGHT VIGIL-- IN HONOR OF OUR CLOSE FRIEND AND FELLOW STUDENT-- ALICIA CAMPBELL. [ Hadley ] AS YOU ALL KNOW, ALICIA HAD A SETBACK LAST NIGHT... AND NEEDS OUR HOPES AND PRAYERS. PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO ASK FOR HER RECOVERY... SO SHE CAN ONCE AGAIN RETURN TO US HERE AT COLBY. HI, ARTIE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY, UH, RHODA, WERE YOU ON CALL... THE NIGHT HADLEY WAS ADMITTED ? NO, BUT I WAS THERE THE NEXT DAY WHEN ALICIA CAME. HEY, HADLEY. YOU WORKING ON THE SOC PROJECT ? GOD, WHEN DID YOU GET SO ANAL ? WHEN YOU STARTED SLACKING OFF. I JUST HAVE A LOT ON MY PLATE. RIGHT. DRINKING LIKE A FISH, DOING DRUGS, GOING THROUGH PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. [ Knock On Door ] DADDY !

YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL, HADLEY. THE DAY NURSE REMEMBERS ALICIA'S VISIT. LET ME WALK YOU OUT. OKAY. BYE, HADLEY. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY. I'D REALLY LIKE TO HELP YOU. REALLY ? YES. HOW'D YOU LIKE TO COME WORK FOR ME ? [ Alicia ] UM, GOSH. WELL, WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO IS GO TO LAW SCHOOL. [ Mr. Ashton ] REALLY ? WHERE HAVE YOU APPLIED ? BAXTER, YALE, PENN. WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE, BUT I AM ON THE BOARD AT STANFORD. REALLY ? UM, YEAH, BUT THAT'S GREAT, BUT IT WON'T HELP ME WITH THE FINANCIAL AID. SO-- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU CAN CLERK IN OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT DURING THE SUMMERS, AND, IN EXCHANGE, WE'LL PAY YOUR TUITION. HOW'S THAT ? OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS ? YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S OKAY. IT'S JUST MY WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU... FOR YOU KEEPING AN EYE ON MY DAUGHTER. AND WHEN YOU GRADUATE, WE GET FIRST SHOT AT YOU. OKAY ! THANK YOU. SURE. YOU'RE GIVING HER A JOB ? A TOTAL FUCKING STRANGER ! YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING FOR HER, BUT YOU WON'T HIRE ME-- YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD, YOUR OWN FUCKING DAUGHTER ! THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. SHE'S A LYING, FUCKING, MANIPULATING, TWO-FACED BITCH ! HADLEY, STOP IT ! [ Sheriff ] THERE'S A MOTIVE, HADLEY. ALICIA WENT AFTER EVERYTHING YOU HAD, EVERYTHING YOU VALUED. [ Mrs. Campbell ] YOU GODDAMN RICH GIRLS. YOU THINK YOU OWN THE WORLD. HE'S GOT MY DAUGHTER. [ Hadley ] IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, MRS. CAMPBELL. YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ? [ Sheriff ] IT WAS YOUR FATHER ON THE PHONE WITH ALICIA THAT DAY. YOU PICK UP THIS PHONE AND YOU TELL HER IT WAS A MISTAKE. I'M NOT GONNA GIVE SOMEBODY SOMETHING AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM. I'M NOT GONNA GO BACK ON MY WORD. NO ! YOU TELL HER ! CALM DOWN. NO. IT'S OVER. [ Dialing Phone ] TELL HER. [ Line Ringing ] [ Jules ] HELLO ? CAN I SPEAK WITH ALICIA, PLEASE ? ALICIA. YEAH. HELLO ?

[ Sheriff ] SEE, TREVOR SAW THE ORDERLY HIT ON YOU. HE WAS EASY, WASN'T HE ? DID YOU GET IT ? I COULD LOSE MY JOB FOR THIS. IT'LL BE WORTH IT. [ Sheriff ] THE NIGHT YOU LEFT THE HOSPITAL, YOU CALLED ALICIA... AND MET HER AT THE CILVER BULLET. THE WHOLE BAR SAW YOU. EVERYBODY HEARD YOU. DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME ! NOBODY USES ME TO GET TO MY FATHER. I'M NOT ! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND. I AM YOUR FRIEND. NO ! YOU NO LONGER EXIST. HADLEY ! HADLEY, DON'T LEAVE ME ! HADLEY ! [ Tires Screech ] [ Sheriff ] YOU WANTED HER OUT OF YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU KNEW SHE'D SHOW UP AT THE PARTY. [ Sid ] I HEARD HER WITH HER DAD, AND I SAW HER WITH THIS VIAL, [ Sheriff ] SIDNEY TOLD THE TRUTH. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. SHE HEARD YOU CALL YOUR FATHER.
