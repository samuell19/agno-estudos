And told the pixie: "I want my dick to touch the floor." It was that clear. The pixie asked him if he was sure about what he was asking for. David nodded emphatically and the pixie made his wish come true... cutting off his legs! What? Nothing. I'll be right back. Come on, time for a run! -What's going on? Nothing. Salva doesn't like to wait. Despite his age he behaves like a teenager. Besides, I always try to give him some money for looking after the house. But he never accepts it. Stubborn man. But you haven't been away for that long. It doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it. Anyway, I invited him to coffee this weekend. I'm sure he'll be fine by then. Get out, Athos! Athos, down boy. What? Didn't you deal with dogs at veterinary school? Yes, cut wide open. Jeez, kid... Well... Let's go. Ready. Let's go, kid! You should eat more. I'm so old, Yet I can move you So easily. Alright That's it. I have asked to level the area... Dad, you didn't charge it before leaving. I have two more batteries in the car. I'm not such a disaster. Wait, I can take you. -I can go on my own. But that way you wouldn't use the battery. Fucking dog. Stop it! I just bathed you! Athos! Athos! Come here! What a great service dog. You'll see what he can do. Athos! Come here! Attention, Athos. Lights! You see? Athos, good boy. Take this. You'll need a lot of those. I have a sack this big in the trunk. For now you can practise with this. Look. The cookies if he behaves himself. The whistle if he misbehaves. I gave them 10 days off to relax. They have worked hard. Down here they're making good progress. Now they are working upstairs. A few things are still missing, but the main ones are done. There's heating throughout the house. Now they are working on the air conditioner using the drop ceiling. All the windows are double glazed. The best ones. And the most important thing, this. It was so hard to assemble, they had to refurbish the stairs. But, there you have it. There's an anti dog barrier up there, so that the silly dog doesn't bother you. How much did it all cost, dad? Don't ever underestimate your father, he still comes up with a good idea once in a while. I'm sure. It smells bad here, right? I don't know. Maybe it's the solvent. No, it smells like rotten food. -I don't know. -It comes from there. What's wrong, boy? There's something here. Out. Let me see. What the hell! Don't come in! It smells like dead dogs. Gross. Dad! Athos! Fuck! Come here! Let me see you. Don't move. You will survive, but we will have to take you to the village. I'll go for something to clean that wound. That thing might be infected. You deserve it. I'm back. Come here. Let me take care of you. Don't move. Stop it! This is not for you. At least the whole house won't stink. It was an old bat. Maybe it came through the window and got stuck. You didn't have enough to double glaze that window. Sometimes things just don't work out on the first try. But they never work out for those who just complain. What was that? Some kind of metaphor? No, just advice from an old man: if you're in a mess, let others help you. Look at him. He may not be the perfect dog, but he's the smartest one I've ever seen. And he's really excited to learn. Athos! Stop it! He's already learnt how to piss you off. I'm going to have a look. They've been working there and it must be a mess. I'll air it out while I'm at it. Give him a chance, please. So you're a genius. Do you want a cookie? Do you want a prize? Athos! Door! Well, maybe you were not that smart. I'm sure you'd do it better. Hey, Vera... If mom's story is true... what would you ask for? Which story? You already know. The story about the well. I don't know... Got it! I'd like to win a lot of medals doing this kind of acrobatics. Come on! Catch me if you can! I told them to move it to the attic, with everything else. I'm sorry. They might not have enough time. -It's okay. It's not okay. I should have come before bringing you here. I know, dad. I know you don't like memories. For me it's very important that we... that you are okay. You want me to be okay? And how am I supposed to be okay? I understand you don't want anything. But at least you could try... -Try...? Is that your great plan? Well... Why didn't you tell me before if it was that easy, dad? Elena I'm doing what I can. That's the problem. I didn't ask you to do anything. I didn't ask you to bring me here, or look after me. To do anything. Do you think you can fix this with a house full of fucking ropes and a stupid dog? I know it's hard, but... Do you know what's hard? You have no fucking idea. I know it's very hard. But you can't punish yourself this way. Day after day. It seems that you want to torture yourself, kid. But you don't have to. It was not your fault. Tragedies happen to us all. You are right. Maybe I should start drinking, just like you did. Too bad I can't even lift an elbow. That was a low blow, Elena. You're not like this. -You were okay after mom's death. That was very hard! And I didn't react properly. But then, I tried to improve and be a good father. Then... I didn't need you then. I needed you before that! I needed a father who didn't waste all our fucking money on alcohol, who didn't abandon mom's house and leave, who was there when I needed him. If you wanted to help, the only thing you had to do was letting me go peacefully and not take those damn pills out of my mouth two weeks ago. And you didn't do that. You didn't do that. So don't lecture me. There are things a father can't do no matter how much it hurts. This may hurt you but it is the fucking truth. I wish I were dead. -Don't say it! Please... Why not? It's the truth. I wish I were dead. It's time for my cookie. Here you go. I still believe in you. I'm going to unload the trunk. And before eating I'll take the dog to the vet. Don't forget the rest of the pills... You outdid yourself, Elena... Athos! Athos! Fuck no! Not now... Dad...? Dad! Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad... Dad! Dad... Be careful what you wish for. Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! Athos! Athos! Athos. Door. What's wrong? Athos. What are you doing? Stop it. Athos, stop it. No! Shit! Fuck you too! What's wrong, Luke? I don't like the music either. But it bothers him even more. It's okay. Salva has to come. "The sisters wished hard... and the well made their wish come true." It's just a fairytale, Elena. Just a fucking fairytale. Not you... No... I'm so sorry... Hi, cripply. How are you doing? Ready to roll? My trophy gave you quite a bump. Get out. Leave me alone. - But you're so alone. I had to come down here, since you don't even dare to go up to my room. And Dad made such an effort to install this little cripple's elevator. Go to hell, Vera. -And how? Are you taking me in that car of yours? Don't say that... -"Don't say that..." It wasn't my fault. -Of course it was. You think you can fix everything by leaving flowers on the road and forgetting what happened? Tell me: didn't you think of me when you Took that turn... or you were just too high? What you're carrying around your neck is enough to knock down a horse. What's wrong? Aren't we friends any more? You should be happy... Your wish has come true: you are all alone. Dad is rotting out there. Even Luke is about to die. Maybe he's already dead. You think the dog has left. But, are you sure? It's like that story that mom used to tell us. Do you remember? You must remember it. She used to tell us the story before bed. She even used to say it was about us. This was when she was still alive. When you talked to me and we were friends. Dad has had a heart attack. Athos has been bitten by a bat that had rabies. He is infected! Bla, bla, bla! Hey, isn't it cold? That mongrel and you have more in common than you think. Both of you want to stop suffering. Has he left? We should call him. Athos! Athos! Athos! Vera. -Where is he? He can't hear me. Athos? Athos? Come here, little dog. Come! Come here, little dog! Vera, stop it. Athos? -Stop it, Vera! Athos? -Vera!! Little dog. Athos. Vera! No! No! Salva. Salva! No! Salva, no! Look behind you! Run! Salva? Athos, stop it! Stop it! Luke... Athos, stop it! No, no... Athos! Athos! Come here, Athos! I have a cookie for you... Athos! Luke... Athos! Dad... I'm so sorry... I'm alone... I'm alone... I'm alone... Fuck! I do not want you here. Can you hear me? I don't even want to see you again! No! no! no! no! I can't believe my fucking luck... Fuck... Come on, you can do this. Fuck! Come on. Come on. Hi. I don't know who you are, but I need help. I am in a house all alone in... Please, wait one moment... Hello. It's an emergency, I can't move. Oncology department of the Our Lady of the Forsaken Hospital. I am a disabled! I am trapped in a room! My dog went crazy. He killed Salva, and now he wants to kill me. In case of an emergency call the ambulance service. on the number 112. For making or cancelling... appointments with any doctor... -112. please call during our working hours. Thanks for your call. Fuck... No... Fuck! No! Dad... You won't leave me alone even now? We'll have a lot of time together where you're going. Didn't you think about that? There is nothing where I'm going. What made you finally decide that? Wow! It's from dad. Dear daughter... -Stop it... Dear daughter, I'm writing here what I wasn't brave enough to tell you before. When you read this I won't be there. You know I was never good at saying goodbye. So, I'll be brief. Do you remember the last medical tests? I lied to you. They were bad. I could have been hospitalized... But what for? To lose a fight that was already lost a long time ago? To lose the last few weeks I could spend with my child? I'm not like that, you already know that. That's why I stopped the house refurbishments. If I was forced to leave you, at least, I wanted it to be where we were happier. I hope we have been happy again. At least, the days we just spent here. I know I haven't always been a good father. You often reminded me of that. I know I didn't even give you the only thing you asked for. You usually say that too. But the worst pain a father can feel is to bury a daughter. I did that once, and I couldn't do it again. I know your life isn’t easy. I know you're suffering and you don't have any strength left to keep trying. But I just can't do it. I just hope you to find your will to live. You have not lost that fight yet. Salva and I never agreed about this. He would have dragged me To the hospital. But he is a good man, he will keep his word. When I no longer can, he will help you with all you need. That's all, child. I already told you I dislike saying goodbye. Especially, when I have to say goodbye to what I love the most. I love you. Signed: your father. Damn! Looks like everything turned out a bit different. Look at the pictures. You've been avoiding them since you entered. Sister, get up and look at them. Come on, trust me. I told you you could. While I was getting over mom's death, you only felt more resentment for me. I won all those trophies for her. I move on... But you stayed behind... That's why you hated me. That's why you didn't want to see me again after leaving that competition. Or have you forgotten the story? And the price you pay for the wish come true. You were driving. But it was not your fault. I don't hate you. I have never hated you. You forgot that. I wish I were dead. But the story was wrong... You just have to wish the opposite with all your heart. I can't. You have to believe, Elena. Because I really want to be with you again. So do I. But, do you know what? It's not your time yet. You have to seek help. Vera... I'm here! Help! Look at me! Look at me! I'm here! Wait! I'm not leaving this time. I'm not leaving this time. Not this time... No way! You're coming with me till the end. Not now! Come on! Come on! No, please... I don't want that. I don't want it any more. You're a good dog, Athos. You can stop suffering now. Someone once said there are two great tragedies in life, one is not getting what you want... the other is getting it. But what is truly hard is fighting against that wish. Fighting to forgive yourself. My fight starts today.
