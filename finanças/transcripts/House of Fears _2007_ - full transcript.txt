A place where nightmares are made and your worst fears are realized! Inside-- - Dude, save it. - It took me so long to get that down. - It was good. Save it. - Right this way! Alright, so everybody's afraid of something right? The House of Fears likes to remind you what you're afraid of. So there's nine fears inside. Death, ghosts, monsters, the dark, clowns, bats, spiders, losing your mind, and my personal Zane fave, sharp knives. - Are you sure we're not gonna get in trouble? - No Samantha, I have keys. It's not a problem. Let's go. Move it in. Alrighty. Good, great. - You're locking us in here? - Yeah, I have to. A lot of punk kids trying to break in here. - Isn't that what we're doing? - Hey relax, the security guy knows we're here. - Damn, wish all mummies looked that good. - Yeah that's the owner of the place, Sidney Neil. She's overseas right now buying who knows what for this place. She's kinda got a crush on me. Makes work a little awkward. - She ain't bad. Now kiddies, grab your buddy, we're moving on. Watch your step there. - Ladies first. Something wrong? - No, I'm okay. I just, places like this just bother me. - You're gonna love it. - Alright, magic time. Alright, everyone watch your step. Alright guys, so there's a lot of expensive stuff in here. So don't, I mean don't touch anything. I'll be right back. - So, what do you think of Zane? - I don't know. - Really? 'Cause I think that the two of you could totally hit it off. - Hailey I know you don't want me to be here. And I promise I will do my best to stay out of your way. But just please don't patronize me. - Hey, check this out. It's mini Zane. - Dude, what did I just say? Don't screw with the stuff. - Shut up, it's just a stupid statue alright. - Did you open that crate? - No. - No, it was already open. - Candice, no it was not like that when I left work today. Zane to Hamadi, come in. Zane to Hamadi, Hamadi come in. Zane to Hamadi, Hamadi I know you're there. Pick it up. Hamadi, it's Zane. Come on I know you're there. - Dude, talk to him later. Come on. Let's go scare some girls. Dude, come on. - Alright, alright, alright. Let's scare some girls. Would you put that down please?! - This guy doesn't shut up does he? Okay, let the fun begin. You ladies ready? I'm ready. - Let's do it! Back it out, no frowny faces. I mean, this place is state of the art right. Everything is animatronics. That way it takes less workers to keep it running. Monday's opening day so hopefully we can get all the bugs worked out! You are about to have nine of your darkest fears realized. You! What is your darkest fear? - My fear is that we're gonna have to hear that sucky voice all night. - Hey bite me. Hailey. - I'm claustrophobic if that counts. - Come on, you can do better than that. - Oh really? What's your big fear? - Being struck by lightening in the crotch. - Yeah he's right. That would scare a brother. - So Candice, what's your fear? - Being suffocated. - That's a good one. Samantha. - Makeup, she's too afraid to wear any. - And what about little Devon? - I would say waking up and looking like you. - You could only be so lucky bro. Get in here! Alright, now do you remember what it feels like, that feeling of pure unadulterated fear. That your mouth's dry, stomach's tight, hair's on end? Shivers racing down your spine. What door? Oh what step? Oh no, what corners gonna come next? And that's when-- - Hey numb nuts, just open the door man. - Yeah cool, just thought we were gonna have a great evening, but yeah whatever. Welcome to the house of fears. As you wander the halls of this building-- - What kind of lame voice is that? Horrors that you have only seen in your darkest dreams. - Actually it is kinda creepy. Enter, at your own risk. - I think I just wet myself. - Wow. - Entre. That got you. Oh my god. Devon watch out for the cobwebs, it could mean there's a spider around. - Hey come on, push like you got a pair. - It's locked. - It can't be locked. Move over. What? I don't understand man. It shouldn't be locked. Oh! - Oh snap. Very sly Mr. Wonka. - Well after you Mr. Wanker. - Well I can barely see anything. - Hey, look at this. That's weird. What happened to Zane? - Turn back now or meet your fate. - Wait, how is he doing that? - Candice, this is your last warning. Leave Devon, he is a hermaphrodite! Funny. This guy is such a dork. - Ah got ya. - No, seriously, how did you do that? - There's a mirror behind the screen. - What? - Yeah, so you stand out there in the dark hall, then you turn the dimmer up on the light. And then the mirror picks up the reflection and projects it onto the screen. - Very cool. - Yeah, really cool. - What was that? - That's your next fear. Ladies first. - I don't get it. Where was the scream coming from? - You move pretty fast. - I swallowed my gum. - I thought you guys said this would be scary. Only thing I'm scared of is that I'm wasting a perfectly good night. - Hey, you know what Devon? I don't recall inviting you. - Yeah, whatever. - Well congratulations kiddies, you made it through your fear of ghosts. Only eight fears left. Let's do it. You, scream like a girl. Alright, try to make it across without touching the old railing. Man it can't be that hard. - 20 bucks says you can't do it. - I'll take your money. - Don't touch the rail! I see Mr. Jackson coming my way! - I'm still standing. - Don't touch the rail! Oh! Yeah! - Oh Devon are you okay? Just take a deep breath okay? - What's up with you and Sam? - I didn't want her to come. - She's your sister. - Step sister. I didn't want that either. - What's the big deal? - You wouldn't understand. - Fine. Whatever. It wouldn't hurt you to be a little nicer to her though. - Yeah, okay. You sound like my dad. Hey, having fun? - Yeah a blast. - That feel good baby? - Yeah baby. - Was that tunnel too dizzy for you? - I don't think it's gonna work out with you and Candice. - Yeah, you think? - Look, this isn't easy for me either. - You mean leaving your school and all your friends to go live with a step-sister who despises you? - It's not you okay? I'm mad at my dad for marrying your mom. Nothing against Lynn. It's just not fair to me or my mom. - Losers can't be choosers my friend. - Oh you're so damn funny. She's not my type anyway. - Neither is Candice apparently. - Well I don't see you complaining about Hailey. You know, you said you weren't even that into her. - You don't know where something's gonna go until you try it. - Alright, well you know what broseph, if you think Sam's so nice, why don't we switch dates? - Okay. - I wasn't serious. - Yeah you were. - Well no, Hailey's not gonna go for it. - And why not? We're just friends, she said so herself right? Ladies. Zane has an idea. - It's not my idea. - We're gonna swap dates. - What? - Wait, who said this was a date? - No, it wasn't my idea, it was-- - Let's try it out. I mean you don't mind do you Hailey? - Well-- - Wait, I don't know if this is a good idea. - Great. You guys ready? - Yeah. - Sweet. Game on. - Shall we my darling? - Yeah no. - This is a house of lame. Why are you messing with Hailey? Hey, we're just friends. Does she know that? - She's the one who said she didn't wanna be tied down to one person. - She said that to you? - Oh yeah. Yeah she likes to play the game as long as the rules bend her way. Sometimes that's not how things go. - You know, I don't wanna be your pawn. - Sam, you're not my pawn. - You are using me to get her attention. - Yeah I would actually like to get to know ya. Seriously I would. - What is this? - Scary nut house I think. You just got your ass kicked by a girl! - Man, what'd you do that for? - You scared me. - Geez alright, well I gotta go get cleaned up and ice these baby's. Carter, take everyone to the mummies tomb. I'll meet you there. Alright, straight down there guys. Suck it up sunshine. - Where is this one taking us. Everything in here looks so real. Touch it, it won't bite. - No. - Go for it. - Okay. Carter! - That's wrong. - That's gross. - That's two. After you. - I think you upset Hailey. - Hamodi? - Your hand okay? What's up Hailey? - That's what I should be asking you. - Okay wait a minute. Maybe I'm misreading your signals here, but I remember you saying that we ought to date around. - Well you can't just swap dates in the middle of the night. Especially not with her. - It's not a big deal. - Maybe not to you. - What's that supposed to mean? - Let's just get this night over with. - Hey Hamodi quit messing around. Hamodi. - You know what this is right? - What? - You will be with Devon forever. - The house is kinda creepy. - Yeah it's alright. - Boo. Ouch! - Hey, don't break it, you're gonna have to pay for that. - The damn thing cut her arm. Look at her arm, she's bleeding man. You alright. - That shouldn't happen. - Well it did. - Zane!? - Oh geez that sounded real. - Yeah it sounds like he's screwing with us. - Maybe he's really hurt. Zane! - I'm tired of him and his stupid ass pranks. - No this isn't something we planned. Zane? Quit screwing around man. - Carter! Are you okay? - Zane! - Is this another one of his stupid jokes? - It's real blood. - Yeah right, let me see that. - What? No look at it. I know stage blood, this isn't it. This is ridiculous. - I don't know, I don't know it could be. - No, no, Carter tell me this is a joke. - I swear it's not. - What are we gonna do? - Look, Zane is just messing with us. Look there is no blood trail. - Whoa, did you guys see that? - What was it? - I don't know. I think there's somebody back there. Zane! Okay this isn't fun anymore. - Look, don't overreact, this so something Zane would do. - No, I wanna go. Now? Yes now. - No, Candice, don't leave. - Come on babe. - No, let's go. - Candice! Candice! - Look, look, I say we just go back to your house and make out alright? - No, shut up Devon. - Wait, wait, look, look. I know you're scared alright. But I'm here with you okay. Know that. - So what do we do? - We need to find Zane. - What?! No, this is totally something Zane would do. - He wouldn't let it go this long. - Wait, you think somebody did this? You think somebody's locked in here with us? - I don't know. Zane! - You feeling any better? - Yeah a little. Kissing doesn't solve everything. - Hey, most things. Hey I feel you right there. - Devon. - Zane?! Come on man. - I will be so pissed if this is a joke. - I hope that's all it is. - Devon! - Come on now. Zane! - They're coming. - Come on, just one more kiss before they come. - No! You know what, you're being a real jerk! - Why do you care what they think?! - It's not about. - What's going on? - Dicko here keeps trying to cop a feel. - Zane? Zane! - It's Zane! Get him down! This is just another stupid prank. - No it's not, get him down! Hurry, get him down! - Zane, Zane! He's not breathing. - Is he dead? - Okay what the hell is going on here? - Who would do something like this? I don't know. - I'm calling 911. - There's no pulse. - I don't have service. - Here. You can use mine. - No service. - Yeah me neither. - The walls must be too thick in here or something. - Look, who else knew we would be here tonight? - No one. - Well some one must. Zane set it up with the security guard. - Maybe he's the one who did this?! - What are you talking about? - Who else do you think it was? - Okay guys, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. Wait, where's the radio? Hello, can anyone hear me? Try changing the channel. - Hello, please, if you can hear me, respond, we need help. Please, we need help! - What was that? - Okay we need to get out of here. - Wait, we can't just leave him here. - Look, do you wanna end up like him?! - Devon's right. There's nothing we can do for him. We've gotta get out of here. We gotta find help now. What, what was it? - I think I just saw someone. - What? Who? - I don't know, we've gotta go another way. - No, there is no other way! - There's hidden passageways between rooms. The workers use them to get around backstage. - Where are they? There's supposed to be one in every section. Check over there. - Here's one right here, come on! Go, hurry. - Which way? Which way? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I think we should go that way. - Are you sure? - Yeah I'm sure. - What? - Turn around. - Why? - What is it? - Turn around, there's someone down there. Let's go let's go. Hurry! - Guys! Devon! Devon where are you?! Hey guys! Guys! Devon! - Guys wait! Candice! She was right behind me! Candice!

What is it? - It won't turn. Look, push it in farther and turn it. - It won't turn. Let me do it, move. - I got it. It won't turn. Look, you haven't got it in far enough. Push it in and turn it! You know what Devon, go ahead. Give it your best shot. - Damn it man! - What? Hey? - You gotta be kidding me. What's wrong? - He broke the key. - It wasn't on purpose now shut up alright! - You finished? - Someone's in here. - It's okay, it's okay. Stay calm. Okay look, there's a phone in the workroom we can call someone from there. Just stay close and follow me okay. The phones gone. - Try paging it. - Anybody hear it? Okay guys, we gotta figure something out. - Like what the hell is there to talk about? Somebody's in here with us and we need to get out now, that's it. - I know. - You think this thing works? I don't know, you think it's got the internet? - I need the password. - Well what's the owners name? - Sydney. - Try that. Try house of fears. - Halloween. This isn't working. Come on, come on. Damn it. And just what do you plan on doing with that? What do you think? I'm covering my ass. - Okay here we go. There's another way out of here. - Where? - Right here. - How do we get there? - Alright we're gonna have to follow the passage ways I guess. And then we'll have to cut through the spooky alley and a few places. - No, no we're not going back in there. Can't we just stay in the passage ways? What about along here? I don't know. The passage ways, they pretty much go from room to room. Or they're dead ends. Guys we're gonna have to go through some of the rooms. - Fine, let's just get the hell out of here alright? - Okay. Guys it's important that no matter what happens we stay together. If something unexpected happens we remain calm. Okay, we stay as a group. And I'll see if we can find something we can use as weapons. Okay? Look. It's up to us to take care of the girls. I gotta know that you're okay. - I'm fine. - You sure? - I said I'm fine alright? - Alright. Stay close. Okay let's take a left here. That should take us out to the graveyard. What is it? - I saw something. - Let me see. Look at me, there's nothing there. Let's go. We gotta keep moving. Take the flashlight. Okay. So there's a long passage way just across there. - Everybody stay together alright? Come on let's go. Let's go. - Is that real blood? - I don't know. Let's keep moving guys. - Get it off of me! - You move and I shoot! Who is he? - Help, help me. Help. Help me. - What's he saying? - I think he's saying help me. - Help me. Help. - Sam, don't. - I'm Samantha. Are you Hamadi? Listen to me. We don't wanna hurt you. - Stone. - I think he's saying something about a stone. - Death. Statue of death. - Sam what is he saying? Sheru statue. - The guys on drugs or something. - Hey! This isn't helping any, he's obviously lost it! - Hamadi what is sheru? Statue. - What? - The statue can reincarnate your fears. Where can we find the statue? - That's not the security guard. Who are we dealing with? - I think it has something to do with that statue. - What are you talking about? What statue? - That statue you pulled out of the crate in the work room. - What are you saying? - He's saying that the statue of the Sheru is reincarnating our fears. Think about what you're saying. - Forget about the damn statue! We gotta get the hell out of here! - Wait, what was Candice's fear? - Look, I don't know. - Being suffocated. - Yeah, that's what she said. - So?! - So she suffocated to death in sand. What was Zane's fear? I don't know, he was stabbed to death. - Okay, well what did he tell us all the fears were? - Ghosts. - Spiders. Losing your mind. - Okay what else? - I don't know, the dark? - Clowns. - This statue, this Sheru, whatever it's called. I think it's bringing our fears to life. - No, no, that's not possible. - Devon what are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid of anything alright. - Sam, what's your fear? You gotta tell me what your fear is. What? - Your fear will kill you. - We gotta get out of here. - We gotta get the hell out of here! Come on! - Sam, we gotta go now. - Okay, come on Hamadi. Come on, we gotta go. Please, you have to stand up. Sam, come on! Hailey wait! - Hailey! Hailey! Hailey stop! - Wait! - Hailey slow down! Hailey, calm down! Okay, look at me. Calm down okay. We gotta stay together. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Shh, it's okay. What did you see? Sam? You saw something, what was it? Sam? - When I was a kid growing up in Wisconsin my family had a farm. One night my dad was lat for dinner so my mom sent me out into the field to find him. When I found him he was just lying there. And I thought he was playing a trick on me so I tried to wake him up. But he wouldn't wake up. And when I realized he was dead I just froze. I just froze, I couldn't yell. I couldn't move. And hanging there above his body was a scarecrow. This tattered old scarecrow and it was like it was just laughing at me. Just mocking. - Was it a scarecrow? Was that was you saw back there? - What are we gonna do? - Okay shh. - We're never gonna get out of here. - Hey, don't say that. We are gonna get out of here. We're all gonna get outta here.
