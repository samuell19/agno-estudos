[dramatic brass music] - [Voiceover] In April 1940, the hopelessly outnumbered Danish armies surrendered to Nazi Germany, and the long occupation started. Hitler needed Denmark as a link to Norway, and also to supply Germany with food, coal and minerals for its factories. The Danes are a tolerant people, and they were prepared to tolerate even the German invaders, at a price. Part of this price was that all Jewish Danes should be left in peace in quiet, to live their own lives in their own homes. There was to be no pogrom, no persecution, no molestation at all. For three and a half years, the Danes were lulled into a feeling of safety and peace. But in October 1943, the Nazis set about changing all this. They sent the forces of evil, the SS, the Gestapo to Denmark, and planned to solve their Danish Jewish problem in one night. There were four million Danes, of which only 8,000 were Jewish. And for the first time in that evil war, the majority rose up and fought to save a minority. For once in history, the whole population of a country turned to rescue one tiny group of its citizens from destruction. This is the story of how the ordinary people of Denmark risked their homes and their lives in order that a few people in danger should not lose theirs. The following is a true story of what happened. [gavel hammering] - The next lot is 37. This beautiful 19th century violin, be of great interest for collectors and musicians. Anybody bidding? Anybody bidding 2,000?

Lillian, you promised to help me. - I'll be there in a moment. - No, you are coming now. [music halts] Ballet school in England certainly made you forget your housekeeping. [cheerful classical music] Must we listen to that now? Lillian, come on. I don't understand where your father could be. - Isn't he down in his workshop? - No, he's not. Both he and Lars have gone, and the workshop is closed. He never goes out without telling me. - [Voiceover] Mr. Stein, your silver's up for sale now. - Now we'll see if I can keep the violin. I need more than I thought I would. The next [talking in foreign language] will be this magnificent coffee and tea service you see is derived of pure silver. Fine workmanship. What is offered? - 3,000. - 3,000 bid for this pure silver. 3,100. 3,200 bid. 3, 200. - What price must you get? - [Auctioneer] And you, sir, yes. - [Voiceover] 3,300. - At least 3,500. - 3,300.

No more than 3,400? - 4,000. [crowd murmuring] - 4,000, your bid, sir, 4,000, very well. 4,000, 4,000, against you, 4,000, bidding on my right. No more than 4,000. 4,000 first, second. Bidding on the right for 4,000. Your bidding, 4,000, first, second, third, fourth and yours. [gavel hammering] [siren wailing] - Here we go again. - One of these days someone might really drop a bomb. It's a grand violin. - Yes, indeed. People prefer bigger instruments, because they give a richer tone. So the Amatis make them. - Are you sure it's a Niccolo? - Of course it's a Niccolo. - How can you be so sure? - The shape of the belly tells us that. Only one like Niccolo could make violins like that. It's priceless. [plucking] Hm? - I hope Mrs. Stein doesn't get too angry about this. - She won't. - I'm very pleased about the violin, but I'm not at all pleased about my silver. - I'm sorry, it's too late, I've sold it, I can't get it back. - My mother gave it to me. - To us. - To me. Her mother had given it to her. I was keeping it for Lillian. - Thanks very much. - We never used it, and it made the tea taste funny. - You can't say that, Daddy, if we never used it. - It cluttered up the house. - How could you sell it without even asking me. - Look at it, it's a masterpiece. It's worth a fortune. - You didn't even ask me. - [Lillian] My wedding present. - I didn't know you were going to get married. - Don't change the subject, Leo. - I'm not getting married. - What are we arguing about? - All we can give her now is an old violin. - An old Niccolo Amati brand violin. - Then I'll marry Niccolo. [elegant piano music] Remember to put your toes up. That's good. Come along now, go over there. Now, we're going to do chasse coupe, do you remember? Come along, you go over there. Come along, Bettina, go over there, come along, come on, get in line. Very good. Come along. Tina? Good. [elegant piano music] That's right, keep going, more to the left. Come on. And turn, and curtsy. Very good. - Come with me, Lillian. Children, go to the bar. Let's do the rond de jambs exercise, from the first position. [cheerful piano music] Lillian, I've been told that the Germans are going to arrest all the Jewish families tomorrow. - Not that again. We've been hearing that for every week for three years now. - I know, but tomorrow is your new year. You will all be home, and that's when they're going to raid. - But nothing's ever happened before. - Every school has been told to send their Jewish pupils home at once. Are any of them Jewish? - Jenny Linston there. Her father's Jewish. I don't think any of the others are. I've never really thought about it. - Then call Jenny out of class and take her home at once. Lillian? I'm sorry I had to tell you this. We'll take care of your things until you come back. - Why are you so sure it's a Niccolo? - See for yourself. - Hm, well. I'd have said it was later. - Then you would be wrong. - If it is a Niccolo, I have a customer for it. - It's not for sale. - You paid 4,000 krone. - [Leo] 4,400. - [Man in Tuxedo] When did the last Niccolo come on the market? - In London, '36. And you see they paid more than 4,000 pounds, which in krone is... - About 70,000. - Or more. - My customer wouldn't mind paying that. In fact, I'm almost tempted to break my rule and buy it for myself. - Again, it's not for sale. - You may never get this chance again. - It's not going to lose its value. If anything, it will increase. - Daddy. Can I talk to you, please? - You're back from school early. - I have to tell you something. - Yes? - You and mother. - Go upstairs, then. I'll be there in a minute. - Welll, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. - If I do change my mind. - Your father will know what to do. - Daddy. - Have you been sent home, then? Are you in trouble? - All of us are in trouble. All the Jewish students from all the schools have been sent home, because they say the Germans are going to arrest us all tomorrow. - We hear that rumor every day of the week. - They said they've been told officially. - What does that mean, officially? The only people that can tell us officially are the Germans. And they're not likely to make an announcement. - Someone in the government. It is possible. It could happen. - I don't think it's going to. We are not running away. - We would be safe in a neutral country. - We are not going anywhere. We live here. We shall not leave our home. - The Fischers went last month. - Listen, they want us to run away. They want us to get scared. To run away is to help them. It needs our cooperation to make it work. I don't intend to help them. I'm not going anywhere. [machine clunking] - Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! - Bang! - Bang! [knocking] - Leo, there's someone downstairs at your workshop, I thought I'd better tell you. - Mr. Stein? - Yes, it's me. I'm Dr. Jensen. - Doctor. - Yes, doctor. - My friend, Mr. Petersen. - Hello. - Can I come in, please, I have something I've got to tell you. - Oh, yes. Come in, please. - Is your family at home? I'd rather explain to all of you together. - Explain what? - Please, I... - Oh, yes. Come in. This is Dr. Yensen, who wants to explain something to us. My wife, my daughter. - I'm sorry to say this, but I've come here to warn you that all the Jewish families in the city are going to be arrested tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow is our new year, and we will all be at home. - You've heard already? - Every week of the year. - This isn't a rumor. We are organizing escape routes to Sweden. - I've been to Sweden. I didn't like it much. Anyway, I live here. - Please, for your own safety, you've got to go and hide. They can't possibly search in all the houses of the city. We'll come for you sometime in the next two days. - That's what they want. They want us to run. - [Mrs. Stein] Leo, don't be stubborn. - Daddy, all he's asking us to do is to stay in a safe place. - [Jensen] Until we're ready to move you. - I am not hiding anywhere. - Of course you can use my apartment. But I'm sure it won't be necessary. - I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer. Do what you can to protect yourselves. - Another rumor, that's all it is. - I wish it were. - Do you know why there's going to be no persecution, young man? Because the Germans like it here. It's quiet, peaceful and easy life. And they know as long as they behave there won't be any trouble. - But there will be trouble. - Do you know what would happen, then? Every Dane in the country would turn against them. [low ominous music] [bell ringing] [door shaking] [knocking] Where's Sam? - He went away. - Went away? - Mm-hmm. Last night, all of them. - Why? - Don't you know? - Just went away? Any idea when they'll be back? - They won't. They've gone. [loud, ominous music] [dogs whining and growling] [pool balls clacking] - I've just had a telephone call. Don't be late tonight. Something's going on. Extra Germans are going on duty. - Good beer. - On the house. - Thank you. - They say all leave's been stopped too. Maybe the rumors are coming true. [low, ominous music] [engines rumbling] - Where's your father? - He had to go to the hardware store, and then he was going to get some groceries. - Something is going on. The two of you had better pack a few things and follow me to my apartment and stay there. - But my husband... - I'll go and find him, come on, please, come on. [low, ominous music] Come on, hurry. Have any of you seen Mr. Stein? [engine rumbling] Taxi! [low, ominous music] [clock ticking] Go back. Leo. Mr. Stein! Over here. Come on, please, Leo. - Why? - Get in, please, quick. - No, I have-- - Get in, there's trouble. Look, now don't be stubborn. You're staying with me tonight. No, not in there. - My wife and daughter. - They're in my apartment, come on. Hurry. [door handle turning] It's me, Petersen. [knocking] Let us in. - [Mrs. Stein] Leo! Where have you been? - [Leo] I'm all right. - They're all over Copenhagen, I've never seen so many before. I don't know where they all came form. You'll be safe here, I have to go down to my shop. [loud, ominous music] [siren blaring] [dog barking] [door slamming open] [door slamming open] [dog barking] [rifle battering on door] [crashing] [talking in foreign language] [slapping] [distant screaming] Lars? Lars? Lars. Lars? [talking in foreign language] - At this point, as the distance between Sweden and Denmark is only a few miles, this is where the greatest number will be taken across. Although there are other points along the coast where we can cross if we had to. The more diversified we are, the better chance we have. I think you all know Dr. Jensen. - This isn't confirmed yet, but they don't seem to have captured more than about 200 people. Over 2,000 homes were raided. They expected at least 5,000 prisoners. - That means that at least 5,000 people are hidden. - Yes, and what more, they're all trying to get over to Sweden, and the Germans know it. - You could send a couple of decoy boats out from the harbor. If we can keep the Germans close to Elsinore, it'll give the rest of you more freedom. - All right. Now, all over the coast, we have fishing huts and smokehouses, and there we can hide them. And there will be dozens of boats, just to keep sending them across. - We know about most of the regular German patrols, the others, well, we just have to keep our eyes open. There are also people hiding in the provinces. We can get them to the hospital, and you'll take over from there. - This isn't a new problem. It's just bigger. [murmurs of assent] - Bigger, yes. But how are we going to move all those people? - Don't think of it that way. It's not so many people, it's so many times. Sometimes only one person. Sometimes as many as 10 or 12. But again, and again, and again. - Lars? Lars? Lars! - No, no! - Hey, go easy. - God, I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare. - I'll say you were, you almost frightened me to death. Uh-uh. Good morning. Bathroom is out there. You know, Lars, you should be very proud of what you did yesterday. But you must be careful. They say they only caught a few people in the raids, so now they are furious. I'll go out and see what I can do to get the Steins to Sweden. - How do you do? - I want to hire a boat. I want to hire a boat. A friend of mine, Paul Andersen, said I might get one here. Do you know anyone that can help me? - No. - I'll pay. - In case you haven't heard, it's illegal to hire a boat. - I'll pay you anything you ask. - I wouldn't like you to get yourself in trouble. - Some friends of mine have to make a trip abroad rather urgently. If you won't help me, at least you could tell me who can. - Listen, mister, I don't know who the hell you are, but we have a living to earn. You're not helping us by going around trying to make us get ourselves shot. Push off and annoy someone else. Go and ask one of them for a boat, maybe. [bell ringing] - Hire a boat, Mr. Petersen? You'll have yourself and somebody else sent to prison, or worse. - But I have some friends who have to go to Sweden, now. - And you were proposing to take them there in this boat. - Well, it's only a couple of miles. I thought I could get a fisherman to ferry them over. Failing that I would take them myself. - Mr. Petersen. Go to the south harbor. There's a shipyard next to pier number 6. Ask for Mr. Lassen. From what I hear, he's helping people like your friend. South harbor, pier number 6, Mr. Lassen. Thank you. - I tried everyone that was home. Either they need money as much as you, or they just don't have it. - Then I've no choice. - Isn't there anything else you could sell? - Got to get it. - But Sanders is too far from here. It's too dangerous. I can go. - No, only I can deal with Sanders. We will go together. - Then we should wait until later. - I think I waited too long already. - Something wrong? - No. Lars and I are going out. - You can't go out, Daddy. - Don't be silly. I'll be back as soon as I can. [boat horns sounding] - This is a blind alley. Where are you going? - To see Mr. Lassen. - You are? - Paston Bensen sent me. - [Voiceover] Why can't we take the ferry? - You'll have to wait. - My name is Petersen. - You'll have to wait your turn. - [Scared Man] We can't wait. Please, the ferry, the ferry! - I'm sorry, it's not possible. Pier's guarded. - Don't you understand, we've got to go. - Of course I understand, but not on the ferry. That's all I'm trying to say. We are arranging something else. Just be patient. - Are you Mr. Lassen? - No. - Tell Mr. Lassen I want to see him please. - I'm not sure if he's free. - Pastor Bensen sent me. - Come on. - Mr. Lassen? - Yeah? - Oh, thank god I found you at last. Isn't it a bit dangerous, letting them all wait in there together? - They have nowhere to go. They're safer in there. - What are you doing about them? - We're taking quite a few across already. Trouble is, the raids were such a failure. Germans are guarding all the harbors now. - I have three friends staying with me I wanted to arrange transport for. When can you help them? - How old are they? - How old? - We're giving priority to old people and mothers with young children. - Oh, I guess they're in their 40s. - Over 60, I'm afraid. - But you can't discriminate, what about all the others? - They'll have to wait. - How are you taking them if you can't use the harbors? - German trains. - German trains? - Empty German coal trucks going to Sweden. - When do you think you'll be able to handle my friends? - For the moment I can't. I have got too many to cope with already. - But-- - [Lassen] I'm sorry, you'll have to try to manage on your own. I'll tell you what. Try Dr. Kaier. The hospital at Bispebjaerg. And if he can't help you, then come back again in two or three days. - Thank you. I'll try the hospital, but really I don't know what to do. I'm not very good at this kind of thing. - Who is? - [Petersen] This man Lassen told me you were organizing something, and could help these friends of mine. I'm hiding them at the moment. Can you help them? - This is a hospital. We use it only for the purpose of saving lives and curing diseases. - What about my friends' lives? - I'm sorry. We are very busy. - Here is my name and address. In case. Goodbye. - We can't afford to take any chances. - The Issacs, doctor. Two children, a mother, and a father and a grandmother. Age 72. - Renamed? - Lassen. - How old are the children? - 10 and 12, both girls. - Put them in contagious diseases. - Very well, doctor. Measles? - German measles. - Mr. Petersen. What are you doing here? - Oh, thank god. Doctor, can you still help them? - We're doing a-- - When can you pick them up? - In a day or two. - Can't you take them today? Please. - Well, all right. I'm leaving to pick up a group now. I'll be there as soon as I can. - Thank you. - [Sanders] What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Stein. - I've decided to accept your offer after all. - What offer, Stein? - You said you had a customer for the violin. - I said I might have, yes. Sit down, please. - But it's the same violin. - I told you, I was willing to try and sell the violin. I'm still willing to try, but there has been a distinct change in the market. A cigar? - No, thank you. But this was just the other day. - It has changed from a seller's market, to a buyer's market. If you come back in a day or two, I'll try and sell the-- - I have to sell it now. You know what happened last night. I just can't wait it out. - It's real scotch. - No, thank you. All right. I'll take 4,000, but now. - I can't hand over thousands of krone just because you changed your mind all of a sudden. - You're not risking anything at that price. - I'm risking 4,000 krone. - It's no risk, you know the value. - No. I must be sure I have a customer first. - Come, Lars. We're wasting our time here. - Bastard. - [Petersen] I don't understand him. - Where could he be? He knew he wasn't to go out. - If he went for money as Mr. Petersen thinks, he must have gone to sell the violin to Sanders. - If he went there he should be back by now. - Maybe something's happened. - He'll be here in a minute. [tense, ominous music] [knocking] - Good. Let's go, quickly. - I can't leave, my husband's not back yet. - Could you please wait, I'm sure he'll be back in a few minutes. - I'm sorry, I can't, I hadn't even planned to come here to pick you up anyway. Now, come on. - Please. - What if something's happened to him? - Look, Lillian. You go, I'll wait. - Mrs. Stein, I think-- - No, I'm not going without him, and that's that. - Mrs. Stein, please trust us, we will take care of him. - Take Lillian. - What about you? - I'll wait. - Will you try and get them to the hospital? - Of course. - I'll split off to Kerte. If you can't get there by curfew tonight, then wait until tomorrow. We will be leaving for the church at Lillehaun first thing at dawn. But just get them to the hospital. - Thank you very much, Mr. Petersen. - See you later. [sad, dramatic orchestral music] - This whole thing's ridiculous. I don't know why I came. [tense, ominous music] - Go and hide and Petersen's workshop. I'll stay here. [tense, ominous music] [machinery clanking] [talking in foreign language] No! No! No! [wood snapping] [talking in foreign language] [wood smashing] [shouts of protest] - We'd better not even try to reach the hospital today. The whole city's swarming with Nazis. Tomorrow morning we'll get a taxi to pick us up and take us straight to Lillelund. - All right. - Here you are. - Thank you. [baby crying] - I just can't stop him. - Leave it to us. - I'll send a nurse. - I think it would be too risky to let him cross tomorrow. - [Nurse] I'll see to it. - Good. I'd like to have a word with you. - Try and get some rest. Tomorrow will be a difficult day. - You will have to go along with one of the first groups to Sweden tomorrow. - But that's impossible, I've organized to pick up more than a hundred people all over the city tomorrow. - Leave that to somebody else. If this is going to work, we must have the Swedish side organized. Two boats were captured last night. I have the instructions for you in my office. - Very well. - Could you spare a moment, Doctor? One of our patients is in a critical state. - My parents? Why are my parents not here? - Hello, Lillian. Are you all right? - Yes. I'm terribly worried about my parents. - Don't worry. They're in very good hands. You'll see them tomorrow. - But why didn't they come here? They should have. - [Jensen] Probably it wasn't safe. - They might have been caught. - If they had, we'd know by now. - How? - We'd know. - Can I telephone? - The Germans have cut all the lines in Copenhagen. Now try and get some sleep. You're in the first group going to Sweden tomorrow, so try to sleep. - I'll try. - Dr. Kaier wants you. - Thank you. - I'll go and have a look. I'll see what happened to the taxi. Come on, the taxi's here. Hurry, hurry. - All right. [motor starting] [tires screeching] - [Voiceover] Dr. Jensen. We are nearly at the bridge. - Get down, get down all of you, quick, mind the windows. [ambulance siren blaring] [loudspeaker talking in foreign language] - We can't go up there. - Why not? - You must take us up north. - I told you I couldn't. Hey, you! Hey, mister. - Please, we're in a hurry, we have to get up there. - Nothing I can do about it. - What's the trouble? - None of your business. - Something wrong? - Germans, we can't take the train. - Where do you want to go to? - Lillehaun. - Well, I can't take you all the way, but hop in. - [Lillian] It's not very far, is it, Sweden? - No. But right now it seems far enough. - It looks close close you'd think you could swim. - Some people have. - This is the first time I've ever felt anything except 100 percent Danish. I've never thought of myself as different from any other girl until today. - You're not different. - How soon will we get to the church? - We should be there soon. Your mother and father will probably join us late this afternoon. - I hope so. [train whistle blowing] [whistle blowing] [talking in foreign language] - Ask him where he's going. [talking in foreign language] - He has been recalled to his unit. [talking in foreign language] They're using Aggebo station as a checkpoint. Thank you. We have to leave the train. - That's the next station. [ambulance siren wailing] [knocking] - They're changing the number plates. It'd look strange if an ambulance from Copenhagen was so far north. [train rumbling] - As soon as the train stops, let's get up and get off. No panic. [talking in foreign language] - Hey! [knocking] - Hey. Could you tell me the time of the next bus to Gilleleje? - There isn't one, not for about two hours. - Oh. You don't know anybody we could maybe get a car from. - What's the trouble? - My friends have to get to Gilleleje as soon as possible. - They'll be there in four hours if they wait for the bus. - That's too late. - How important is it? - It's very, very important. - It's impossible to get a car. Wait a minute. I've got an idea, come along. [bell chiming] The bus will be here any minute. - I thought you said it wasn't due for two hours. - It isn't. The bus to Gilleleje isn't. We're waiting for the bus from Gilleleje. - From? [dramatic orchestral music] - Where is Pastor Nielson? Ah. - Hello. - Hello. Take the ambulance back to the hospital. - Aren't you going back yourself? - No, I'm going over tonight. - Your group will be going out first, Jensen. - Good, the sooner the better. - My wife is getting some food for them. - Thank you. Now, all of you are going across on the next boat. And I want to explain what is going to happen. They have to bring a Swedish trawler right across waters that are patrolled by the Germans. Silence is very, very important. Silence and speed. - Sorry, I'm afraid there's been a slight change in the schedule. The bus has to go back to Gilleleje, it can't go on to Copenhagen. - [Voiceover] Why? - We have some new passengers, they have to get to Gilleleje. Does anybody object? - I do. I have a very important appointment in Copehagen. - [Bus Attendant] Their appointment is more important. - You don't have to stay on the bus, you know. - I insist you complete this run as scheduled. - Get out, then. - We will only be a couple of hours late. - I'm reporting you to the authorities. - What authorities? You don't mean the German authorities? - Make him get off. - [Voiceover] Come on, get out, then. [dramatic orchestral music] - I have to give your child an injection. It's only a mild sedative. [baby crying] Will you roll up the sleeve? - Yes. When does the boat leave? - Oh, in about half an hour. He should be asleep by then. - How long for? - Three or four hours. You should all be safe in Sweden by the time he wakes again. - I hope so. Thank you. Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right, thank you. [whistling] - [Voiceover] Germans! Everybody out, follow me! [fast-paced, tense orchestral music] [gun firing] [tires screeching] [bullets ricocheting] [guns firing] [screaming] [screaming] - Over here, Jensen. Your group can join mine. - [Jensen] All right. - Try and keep your group together. Tell them to be quiet. They're safe here, we'll come for you later. - Okay. - [Group Leader] Send someone up to the church. [dramatic orchestral music] - Come on, hurry. Ah, he's asking for Dr. Jensen. - I'll take him. [sweet, triumphant orchestral music] - Let's move on. - [Voiceover] Hide in the huts. [sobbing] - Wait here, until you get the signal to board. - How soon will that be? - We're not sure yet. - Before we leave, it's important you know how grateful we are. - Dr. Jensen's going across with us, and then coming back. - But it's too dangerous going back and forth. - It has to be done. There are still thousands here that need help. - It's difficult to express the way we feel about all this. - I think the last few days have been a lesson to us all. [knocking] - My violin! - You left it back there, I'll get it for you. - Safe journey, everybody. Come back soon. - My violin. - Sorry, can't wait. [boat engine starting] [wistful orchestral music]
