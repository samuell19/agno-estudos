And so, that's how I ended. A stiff in a body bag. Satta... a good cop. I did a hell of a job for him. I hope he remembers. Hey, Satta, what's going on here? Silencio. Silencio. Silencio. Silencio. Silencio! Per favore! E morto. So if he's dead, let us in, all right? Where's the phone in this place? Creasy is dead. Right. Christian Creasy, ex-C.I.A. agent, died this morning at Umberto First... David... and his wife, Julia. The only woman he ever loved. I guess I was the only man he ever loved. It worked both ways. Smarter than me. Knew when to get out of that shit business himself. He's a little crazy. I love the guy. Big news! Finally they got me inside a body bag. I've seen a lot of body bags. Never pictured myself inside one. And so... this is once upon a time, after the 'Nam, after South America, after Beirut. The "once upon a time"... when all I wanted was to blot out the nightmares. I never had to tell David that. He just knew. I drive this car and these people to Lake Como. He got me the job. No, his brother Elio did. Had an agency, fixed me up as a bodyguard. About the house... This guy, this lawyer hired me for his client. Take the next left. Did they give you a gun at the agency? Yes, Jane. The agency gave him a gun. He has to have one for insurance. Fucking guns. Shit. Italy. Kidnappings, terrorism. Go on, Mr. Creasy. In Italy, we're used to that. It's just a control. I think we should call New York tonight. I must have something to eat first. - Michael, I will give you a drink in there. - Sam! All right, we'll have a drink now, but then we've got to eat, okay? - All right. Very well. - Sam? - Could you get me some ice? - Go and get some ice. Michael and I have a lot of work to do. How unusual. - Where's Sam? - I don't know. - Could you find her? - Sure. He just arrived, but he needs our help. Do you have the cigarettes I gave you? Uh, would you show Mr. Creasy to his room? No, thanks. Ettore, I'm going to the car. If the papers aren't there, I've left them in the office somewhere. Over there. Right there. I'm Samantha... Sam. I went to a school called Greenwich Village Neighborhood School... in New York. Can I help you? No, it's okay. What part of the States are you from? California. Where in California? Up north. Oh, up north? So you must have read Of Mice and Men. It's my favorite book. No, I didn't. That's strange. A kid. I didn't know it'd be a kid. To hell with David. He must have known. How can I forget? But you didn't even try. - At least try. - Da-Dav... - Give it a cha... - Listen to me, David, please. What do you... Try, I said. At least try. I... I don't know what you're worried about. I didn't know it'd be a kid. I want out. Please, I want out. I just don't wanna do it. Chris, you don't understand. - You don't have to do anything. - Yeah? How the hell am I supposed to protect her? I could... Hold on a minute. I got Creasy on the phone. He's worried about this Balletto guy with the whole job and everything. What's the problem? Listen, I just talked to Elio. He's here. He says you don't have to worry about it. This guy Balletto's just trying to keep his wife happy. Yeah, you're not gonna be a bodyguard. You're a fuckin' babysitter. You understand? - Oh? - She's a nice kid. Where are you at, in the middle of a fuckin' dance hall? I can't hear you. Chris? Chris. Ho! Say somethin'. Chris! We even take another half interest point. But we must have the transferral by Thursday, or it will be disaster. I know, but you'll have to negotiate with them yourself, in person. Tell them I can be in New York whenever they want me to be there. Don't be too eager. You'll just put yourself in a weak position. But we are in a weak position, Michael. Please call them. No, thank you, Bruno. Hello? Hello, it's Michael Midler. And so, now here, the placid shores of Lake Como, I'm inside a family. - Good night. - Good night. And now another kid. I just can't do it. Sam, please leave. - But I brought you the book. - Sam. Please. Did you like school? Mr. Creasy, did you like school? I'm driving, Sam. You mean you're just like Lennie in the book. You can't do two things at the same time. Here. You finished it already? Yeah. Did you like it? "'Guys like us got no family." They ain't got nobody in the world... that gives a hoot in hell about 'em.' 'But not us, ' Lennie said, "cause I got you..." and you got me. "We got each other, that's what.'" That's my favorite part. Isn't that beautiful? What? Nothing. Sam, always wait for me inside. And if you don't see me, then just stay put. Okay? Signorina. Hello. - Hello. - Good to see you again. Do you mind telling me who this man is? He's Mr. Creasy, my friend. That's when I should have left. But where to? Left Balletto at the airport. The mother went out. The kid must be on her own. Bruno on the terrace. So what? Why do I feel so tense? Must be the weather. Sam, stay in the back. What are these? Don't. Listen, Sam... Your parents pay me to keep an eye on you... and to drive, not to talk. So let me do my job, okay? Look... There's a lot of shit out there... - kids shouldn't have to see. - I'm not a kid. I'm 12. Okay. Sam? Sam! Fuck! Sorry I'm an asshole. Are you gonna tell my parents? What, that you talk dirty? Come on. Let's go. Oh, no. Could we have a Coke or something? You look terrible. Oh, yeah? I really look terrible? Okay. What do you want? I wanna be friends. Is that so hard? Creasy, do you know who discovered America? We're studying it. Christopher Columbus. No. It was the Vikings. Some say it was the Irish. I know, but I don't believe it. The Irish do. But it couldn't have been, because when the Viking came, there were no Irish... there were only Indians. And... when Christopher Columbus came... - And so I lose. - He thought it was... India. He didn't know it was America. So I live here and the days pass. It's an easy routine. Just me and the kid. Parents almost never here. At least I don't have to think. Sorry to wake you. Sad woman in a sad house. Just needs someone to hang on to. Thank you. Hey! Get out of the way! Come on! Quiet, ladies! Come on. Come on. Where's my mother? She got held up. She said she'd be home later. She said she'd come to get me. Did you wait for her? A while. - How long? - A while, Sam. You should have her. At least she'd stay home. Why don't you say something? I know you wanna do it. It's disgusting. You're disgusting. Here. Hold that for me. Okay. This is gonna hurt a little bit. Okay. Was she with Michael? I know she was. Relax your foot. Jealous, right? Boy. Why don't you answer me? I will, when you stop talking bullshit. Does that hurt there? Okay, I'll stop. Now will you answer me? You know, you could have won. Why'd you give up? I couldn't care less about winning. I don't want to win. You got off to a bad start. Then you let that other kid push you... I told you, I couldn't care less about winning. Now answer me. If you want to walk tomorrow, - I'd advise you to wrap that thing up in ice. - Keep your advice. You're not my teacher, you're not my friend. You're nothing. So leave me alone. Stay here! Stay here! Don't... I'm sorry. Sam! I found this in a shop. Go ahead and open it. It's about Columbus and Marco Polo. You said you liked that kind of stuff, so I thought... I'm sorry. It's okay. Come on. Little bit faster, Sam. Come on. Come on! Oh, it's me. I got good news for you. Elio says he's got somebody to take your place for you. No, I swear. What do you mean, no? No. I believe you, David. I believe you. But no. H-How's Elio? Here. You want some? - I mean, about his wedding. - Come on. Is he ready? How do you know about the wedding? You told him about... You told him about the... He's coming to the wedding. David? Maybe I'll bring somebody. Just a friend. Come on. Okay, let's go. That is not bad. Good. Good! Let's go again. No, no, no. The white ones really are much better. But they're not pink. They're white, but they have, like... Come on. They're pink. I can see pink right there. What, those pink ones? Or do you like those red ones? I say the white ones. Shoes! How come they're my shoes, and you picked them? Because now we're gonna start workin' really hard. - I can't work any harder. - Oh, yes, you can. Looks like no one is really taking the lead. As they approach the turn, it looks like... Young Manuela, I think, is taking the lead. Let's cheer them on a little stronger. Yeah, that's Manuela... No... I... I think it's Balletto who's catching up. No, she's still alive. Manuela. Samantha. It's... Looks like Balletto is taking it away. I think it's Balletto! Yes, Balletto takes it away! Wow! First place then is Samantha Balletto. Second place is Manuela Grivoldi. And third place goes to... Come here. Aspetta. Aspetta. All right, everybody. In close together. Okay. Smile. Grazie!

And that's what I'm very good at. What are these? You don't give up, do you? Okay. One day a guy was asking me... a bunch of questions I didn't wanna answer. He smoked a lot. He didn't have an ashtray. See, Sam, there are some things in life you wanna forget about. Come on. What are we talkin' about this... No! Creasy! Creasy! Creasy! No! Creasy! Please. Please don't kill me. Please don't hurt me. Creasy! Creasy! Run! Run, Sam, run! Run, Sam! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Creasy! Creasy! No. No! No! No! Creasy! Creasy! - Get in! Get in! - No! Creasy! Andiamo! - Andiamo! - Creasy! Andiamo! No! Mom? Dad? I'm fine. I got a few scratches, but they cleaned them up... and they're healing okay. I'm not being starved... or beaten... or threatened. I'm blindfolded most of the time, but it doesn't bother me. They often tie my wrists too, but not always. I'm not scared, and I'm okay. They say they'll let me go... as soon as you pay the ransom. I hope it'll be soon. I miss you. I miss you a lot. All of you. So please, hurry. Nobody's dictating this. I'm saying it the way it comes. Bye for now. Love, Sam. They'll be calling anytime now. You'll take it, Mr. Midler. What do you want me to say? The truth. Say we are pressuring you. Say we won't let you pay the ransom. It's all down here. But if they ask for something that we can give them, something that we have... No. Even if we would let you, you mustn't pay. Believe me, I've had a lot of experience with these things. They are professionals. Give them the money, and they will kill your daughter right away. - Statistics prove that... - Fuck your statistics! She's our daughter. You cannot prevent us from... Signor Balletto, I've got every right. In fact, the threat is unusually specific. It seems that it is the life of Samantha Balletto itself... that's at stake. We will of course keep you informed... - of latest developments in this case... - No! No! - No! - What's going on? Chris! Oh, shit! Don't! Come on, man! I got it! No! No! Come on. Stop. I got it. Give him a shot of something, huh? What do you got? Shit in your brains with this fuckin' radio or what? Oh, you don't understand? - David! Stop! - Hey! Okay! Okay, okay. You don't understand? Buongiorno. - Mr. Midler? - Yes. Who is this? My name doesn't matter. I'd like to talk to you about the Balletto case. I'm listening. We have Samantha Balletto. Do exactly what I say, and she'll stay in good health. - If not, we will certainly kill her. - But... Mr. Midler, you'd better cooperate. You have three days. We want a million dollars. I'll call you back and tell you where and how to drop it off. - No, no. I need more time. - Thank you. - I'm not ready yet. - Thank you, Mr. Midler. - We'll speak again. - Maybe there's another solution... Rabbia Cremasco. Ghizzi, Carlo, detto il boss. No. Marscese, Mauro. Did you ever see anything that could help us? No. Bronsi, Michaele. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Uh, when can I take him home? He's already better. He doesn't have the intravenous... Yes, but you know this is a military hospital. What's the difference, a military hospital? It doesn't make any difference, you know... It's safe here. But it's safe at my hotel. It's the same thing. Okay. Grazie. What was that? I was trying to find out how long they're gonna keep you here, that's all. Get me outta here. What? Get me out of here. Why do you wanna get outta here? What are you gonna do? David, they're gonna kill her. They'll kill her. They were tipped off. No doubt about that. We were coming from the wedding. Someone told them where and when. The lawyer? No. The villa. Maria, the maid? No. Bruno, the servant. The terrace that night. He was always wound up like a spring. I would like to speak with... with Mr. Creasy. Yes, Mr. Cre... Who are you? Say somethin'. Say somethin', fuck! Who are you? Hey! Say something! Ho! What's this? .38 special. Colt .45. Beretta 20 and 92. Minelli. Mini-Frags. Where we goin'? To fuckin' war? What, did you find somethin' out? Look. Those mug shots that the cops showed us... I'm gonna find one of those guys, and you're gonna help me find one of those guys. And... I'm gonna find out what he knows. And? And what? What if he don't know anything? What are you gonna do? You gonna kill him? Then you get another one. He don't know nothin'. You kill him. Get another one. Kill him. Keep goin'. Look at this old man over there. He don't know nothin'. We'll kill him. Kill everybody. What's the fuckin' difference? If you had a company, the sales, you'd know what's right and how to do it. Is that what you wanna do? Dave, what the fuck am I gonna do? You tell me. What am I gonna do? Maria, don't disturb Signor Balletto. Could you please bring down my green bag from my room? Thank you. Creasy. How are you, my friend? Will you come to sit down? No. Maria's bringing my bag down. Okay. May I take... No. I'm sorry. Thank you. David was right. I should have sent for my bag. I didn't need the pain of coming back. And so, guys like us... So, Bruno, you did have a conscience. This place is great, ain't it? - Nobody's been here for 20 years. - Yeah. People don't even come here anymore. Now, that porno house is where that faggot Rabbia hangs out. - Yeah. - Elio clocked him. He goes there every night by himself. I want ya to see this. I found some old friends of ours. You recognize these fucking guys? Whatever you use, I'll take the rest. I know you're not gonna take this. I'm takin' it. Does that one have fond memories for you? I'm gonna meet Elio and two of his bodyguards. They're gonna help us out. I don't know what they're gonna do. So don't make me wait long, huh? Just in case you have a problem with that sissy, give me a call. I'm mean, if you get hung up. I mean... Now, don't make me wait long, huh? No. This film... is our last warning to the Balletto family. We would like to inform you... - that the police refusal... - Hey, bella. to let you pay the ransom... - Open your eyes. - is unacceptable to us. - Look at the light! - You are playing... - with your daughter's life. - Don't look at us. If you do not meet our demand... - immediately... - Nice smile, now. Okay? You will be responsible for the consequences. Don't look at us. Did you understand? This is what I want you to send 'em. "This film is our last warning to the Balletto family." We would like to inform you... that the police refusal to let you pay the ransom... is unacceptable to us. "You are playing with your daughter's life." Ciao. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Don't move. Listen. I'm gonna ask you some questions. Until I get the right answers, I'm gonna start cutting the fingers off your hand. First one hand, then the next. Then all the toes on your feet. What kind of question? You know? Ask me. Okay. If you want. Hey! Nobody can hear you. Rabbia. That bloody bastard bodyguard? - Where is Samantha Balletto? - I don't know. I don't know. Sandri knows. Sandri. Who's Sandri? - The one... the other one works with me. - Where is he? Don't ask me, please. I want the kid back. Where the fuck is he? Near the Rialto bar. Where? Casconda, number five. Yeah, but Sandri... is the right man you're looking for. I told him, "Don't touch la bambina. Don't do anything." - But he wasn't listen to me. - Oh, no. No, no, I just wanna... Where's the girl? Which girl? Samantha Balletto. You're crazy. What are you doing? You blow house up? It wasn't me. Don't do that! Stop that... See! You crazy. You die too! I don't care. Conti. Conti? Yeah. Lolussa. He know where she is. He come to get to the other guy. Where is Conti? - Stop... Stop that, okay? - Where is he? - Okay, okay, I tell you. - Where is he? Where? - Where? - Via Rambaldi. - Via, what? Rambaldi. - Number nine. Sandri. Sandri! You see a guy with a limp? Conti? Conti, listen. The American... he's looking for the kid. He's crazy. Sandri gave your name. He knows where you are. No, don't move. I'll have some guys in front of your place in five minutes. Bravo. What? I'm sorry. It's... It's a mistake. I-I'm sorry. - I'll kill you. - No! Where's the kid? - You want the Balletto kid? - Yeah. - She's okay. - Yeah? No, don't worry. She's okay! I'll take you to her. I know where she is. - Yeah? - Yes. Take it easy. - Please, stay cool. - Take me to her. Please, stay calm. All right? Shut up, Maria! I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. But they wanted the money. Clean money. - You're not gonna kill me, are you? - Maria. I swear to God, I didn't want to do it! I swear to you! Now, she's been treated well. Look, I have kids too. She'll be happy to see you. You're Lennie. You're Lennie! She talks about you all the time. Lennie! That's you, right? You're Lennie! Oh, my God. - Hospital! - Sam. Which way is Sam? - Hospital! - Which way is Sam? - Hospital. - First the kid! Then the hospital! I'll take you! I'll take you! Hospital. How many guys? No... Nobody. Just a little kid who... who brings her food every night. Which truck? I don't know. I swear, I don't know. Don't leave me, please. Please. Please, don't leave me. I told you everything I know. - She's here. - Yes. Yes, she's here. Yes, I swear. Don't leave me. Take me to the hospital, please. I don't wanna die. Please, take me. Please! Fucker!

And so, that was once upon a time when, for those I challenged, my death had to be. He's dead. Yeah. Sure. Five minutes ago. Try to get this in the street final, okay? An hour ago. Creasy. C-R-E-A-S-Y. He's dead. - Creasy's dead. - Scusi. Here's the text. Christian Creasy, ex-C.I.A. agent, Recipient of the highest award... died this morning at 5:45 a.m. With the compliments of the U.S. Embassy. From now on, he is Lennie Lazarus. Oh, no.
