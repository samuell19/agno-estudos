♪ In May 1853, a United States Navy fleet led by Commodore Matthew Perry entered the Port of Naha in the Kingdom of Ryukyu. Perry was en route to Japan where his famous black ships would force the country to open up to the West. Overriding the protests of the Ryukyu government, he came ashore and demanded the right to establish an American outpost. Already at this early date Perry had conceived a plan to occupy the Ryukyu Kingdom, now known as Okinawa, as a toehold for American maritime operations in East Asia. Ninety-two years later in 1945, after the longest and bloodiest battle of the Pacific War, the American military claimed Okinawa. Perry's vision of occupying the island had finally become a reality. ♪ And now, a further 70 years later... Okinawa today. American bases still occupy 18 percent of Okinawa, including much of the flat land of this rugged coral island where 1.4 million people live. Okinawa exists as an island of bases treated with discrimination by both the Japanese and American governments. The most contentious of the 32 American bases is the Futenma Marine Corps Air Station, located here in a densely populated city, and known as the most dangerous base in the world. In 2004, August 13th, a CH-53D Marine Corps helicopter crashed into this building, the administration building, fell to the ground and burned. No one was surprised by that. People were, of course, shocked and terrified but everybody knew that with a base like that in a crowded city like this, there would be an accident. What was extremely remarkable about it was what happened after that. Uh, Marines came streaming over the fence as if they were prepared to do so. Uh, then they occupied this campus. No, no, no. Out, out. - Out, no. -Bye. And here are these kids, 18, 19 years old in Marine uniforms shouting orders at their elders, the newsmen, as if they had the authority to come into this foreign country and order the people to do this, that, or the other thing. I'm not sure if they would do the same kind of thing in mainland Japan, or in Germany, or in Italy, or in Great Britain. I rather doubt it. Maybe in Korea. But certainly in Okinawa. In 1997, the U.S. and Japan agreed to close the dangerous Futenma base and build a replacement base in a less populated area here in the north. After a delay of nearly 20 years due to strong local opposition to the new base, preparations for construction began in earnest in 2014. Meanwhile, the existing base in Futenma remains open, and local residents engage in a symbolic protest, attaching ribbons and tape to the fence around the base. ♪ ♪ The Battle of Okinawa Memorial at the southern end of the island stands in witness to the ferocity of the combat that took place over heavily populated terrain. Some 240,000 of those who died during the battle have their names inscribed at the Cornerstone of Peace. 150,000 Okinawans, one-quarter of the island's population were killed along with 77,000 Japanese and 14,000 American soldiers.

We--on board the ship, they told us about the island. They told us there would be about 100,000 Japanese troops there. They told us there would be a very poisonous snake, the habu. All we were really told was to expect heavy opposition and more artillery and mortars, and a stronger Japanese force. They told us our landing would be April 1st on Okinawa. We had no idea where Okinawa was but they brought out some maps. Our mindset was, basically, this was our job, the Japanese had to be defeated. We knew there'd be a lot of casualties, and we were kind of conditioned to 'em. ♪ On April 1st, 1945, the American invasion of the main island of Okinawa began. 550,000 U.S. troops were to wage a battle that lasted for 12 weeks. ♪ Coming ashore on the beaches of Yomitan, the main American force headed south toward the Japanese headquarters bastion in Shuri. After two months of bitter fighting, Shuri was occupied. ♪ The battlefront moved south in pursuit of the retreating Japanese until organized resistance came to an end at Mabuni on June 23rd. I landed on April 1st as--in reserve. We had to transfer, there was a natural coral reef that ran across the beach area, so we transferred from landing craft to the Ducks, which are tracked vehicles, and that took us ashore. And we actually dug in about 500 yards off the beach. We were digging in... ...in this area and there was a hill maybe that went up behind us, 50 yards behind us, and I noticed some Okinawans. There was a cave up near the top. Came out... ...and looked at us... ...and said something among themselves and then disappeared back in the cave, and then they did that about three times in total. So maybe rather foolishly, I thought afterwards, I took my .45-caliber pistol and went up there. And they were in the cave, I couldn't see 'em. And I yelled, I think it was... You know what that means? "Come out." And about the fourth time, some older lady sticks her head out. I kind of do like this. She goes back in, brings out seven civilians. Fortunately, there were no Japanese soldiers there. And there was, oh, three, four old men, couple older ladies, and maybe three children. What the man did, he must have did it 20 times. He pointed at my pistol then he pointed to his head. And I said, "I'm not gonna shoot you," and he kept doing that, he wanted me to shoot him in the head. Well, I didn't shoot him in the head. But that really stuck in me. He was so indoctrinated that I'm convinced he wanted to be shot in the head.

And that battle went on until late June of 1945. So I wasn't a good soldier but I was a darn lucky one. Really. So the battle is still going, and it... The noise of it had moved south when the Japanese retreated to the southern end of the island. I went up back on Dick Hill one day. I went to where our mortar was set up and there's the... ...the cases for 'em still laying there soaking wet and mud, and dead Japanese bodies decaying, flies.

Did you tell stories about Okinawa after you got back? Not at first, not at first, no. Not at first, not at all. Had nobody to talk to. And some of the things that I would talk about were somewhat unbelievable. Who would believe that we did some of the things that we did? Who would believe, for instance, I don't know if it was the third night we were in on the front lines where we actually killed a man and a woman, elderly person, a younger woman with a baby. They were traveling around at night. Even though flyers had been sent out to the-- leaflets were dropped on the island, "Don't move around at night." Our own soldiers were told, "Don't move around at night." Nobody ever talked about this episode with the baby. How did I know about it? Okay, old Laz always being the perfect soldier was assigned the burial detail. And I helped bury that baby. By the time we got to them, the rigor mortis had already began to set in.

Anyway, it was the children of Okinawa that mattered most, and our Civil Affairs sections realized that candy and kind words, medicine and education and recreation would make them more helpful and useful neighbors to a naval base than their broken-spirited parents.

By the end of 1945, ten air bases had been completed throughout Okinawa. After the war, Okinawa and its land were treated as the spoils of war and transformed into an American bastion in East Asia. The island was used as a primary staging ground for U.S. wars fought in Korea and Vietnam. Still today, U.S. military bases occupy 18 percent of the main island of Okinawa. It is one of the largest concentrations of bases within the vast network of 1,000 American bases that straddles the globe. The consciousness of the U.S. military as a conquering army is reflected in the fact that bases such as Camps Kinzer, Foster, Hansen, and Schwab carry the names of soldiers who died during the Battle of Okinawa and were awarded the Medal of Honor for their valor. Day after day, plane after plane, the B-29s roared up from their Okinawan bases. Out over the Yellow Sea, a thousand miles to missions over North Korea to blast strongholds held by the communist enemy. The bombers fought their war from that important little island, Okinawa.

I honestly looked at it similar to the Wild West saloons with the bar girls and, you know, I learned what bar girls were, you know, they were also prostitutes. There were definitely two different universes. I paid no attention to the other universe when I was in the military over there.

You know, I'm trying to edge it forward. I'm not gonna, you know, I wasn't gonna plow through anybody. So I just started kinda inching it forward to try to get outta there. They start rocking the car, so I called in an emergency, what we referred to as a 10-2. A 10-2 in MP vernacular means there's an MP in trouble, we need help.

However, no one talked about this incident for 38 years after the war ended. Group suicides famously took place in numerous places during the Battle of Okinawa, but when the incident came to light in 1983, Chibana Shoichi was stunned to learn that this tragedy had been endured by his close neighbors.

A lot of young people, when they are sent abroad by the U.S. military, may not have been much out of their hometowns, and the question is, what are they told, and retold, and retold about what their relationship is to the local people? Are they told, for instance, that, "All the local people welcome you. You are their protectors. They are so happy and grateful, so appreciative for you coming to protect them." And if that's the message, you can misread a smile, and you can certainly misread a smile from a woman who's been hired to serve drinks in a bar, or a woman who is working in a massage parlor. The base commander explained things about Okinawa that we ought to know. "There are a lot of communists here, beware," and this, that, and the other thing. "Try not to upset the people," and then he said, "On Okinawa, the number of prostitutes is approximately the same as the number of U.S. military. There's just about one for each of you." And no law had been passed against prostitution, so it was legal. So it was just something that one could do. And virtually everybody. Uh, with some exceptions, virtually everybody availed themselves of that service, and that's part of what made Okinawa exotic in the Marine Corps imagination. But you've just learned that quote, "Asian women are compliant," that they are very, um, if not passive, at least very friendly, and maybe you've even heard the word obedient. But you combine homegrown American racism about Asian women with liquor, with being on leave, with being guys altogether, with not having commanders who push really hard on what you do off base, and you put a lot of young women at risk.

Another MP I know investigated a hotel girl that had been raped and violently murdered actually. On September 4th, 1995, in the town of Kin, three American servicemen attached to the Camp Hansen Marine Base abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl. The incident sparked massive demonstrations of anti-base sentiment aimed at both the American bases and the Japanese government. The three men who perpetrated the rape were aged 20 to 22, and all had grown up in the Deep South in Georgia and Texas. All three enlisted soon after graduating high school, and were sent to Okinawa. The ringleader, Seaman Marcus Gill, returned to the United States after serving seven years in Japanese prison. He refused our requests for an interview. Marine Kendrick Ledet served six and a half years, then settled outside of Atlanta where he found work at this pizza parlor and tried to make a new start. But in 2006, he raped and murdered a college coed who also worked at the pizza parlor. He then committed suicide in her apartment in this townhouse. The third man, Marine Rodrico Harp, agreed to be interviewed in December 2012. In the nine years since he returned to the U.S., Harp had struggled to find steady work and a stable life. He was unemployed and living in Griffin, Georgia, the town he grew up in. My training was--my MO was Motor T transportation.

So we went, you know, went back to, or went clubbing, we just rolled around the barracks and everything, and that's, that's when Gill, you know, started talking about, you know, doing something, you know, committing a crime or whatever, whatnot. All that came about after that, that was the end of-- That night, that was the worst night of my, you know, of my memory. You know, me being there. So he didn't say, "Let's go find a girl, and, you know, have some fun." He said, "Let's go rape one." Yes, "Let's go rape a girl." Did he say why? He said this was the last, it was his last tour overseas, and he was going back to the United States. Yeah, it was like he do it all the time or something. That's what he was saying. I figured this wasn't Gill's first time doing that. Yeah. It was still daylight, so it had to be about four, and that's when all this came up. And that's when we was at the, he was like picking out girls. "How about that one right there?" And, "How about that one?" So me and Ledet went on in the place, and he stayed out, you know, just sweating girls, or whatever, whatnot. He said, "Put something over her mouth." So I put tape on her mouth, and then, at the time where I went, you know, Gill said he knew a place or somewhere he can go, so he took her to a place, and then he-- He said, "She keep looking at me." So that's when Ledet, you know, tore a piece of tape off and covered her eyes up with the tape. 'Cause he said she just kept looking at him. And so... You know, I, I still think about it, and... You know, I was in my room in my cell, I wish I could just tell her I was sorry, you know? You know... It changed my life the same it changed hers, I know hers even worse, you know, 'cause she gotta go through this. You know, thinking about it, and I think about it every day. None of this was my intention of--I mean, committing a crime, you know, thinking about doing something like that, because, like, I don't have to do nothin' like that. And I don't know what came over me that possessed me to still go through with this, you know? I have it in me where I did something that... I know I shouldn't have done, you know? I go to church, and I ask for forgiveness, but really, why should I ask for forgiveness? 'Cause I'm still going to hell, that's the way I feel. I just think about it, I don't know. At the Okinawan bases, in recent years, the military has discouraged soldiers from drinking off base, and the incidents of rape in base towns has fallen. However, as is true throughout the U.S. military, it has come to light that sexual violence between service people inside the bases is widespread. The Associated Press obtained military records of 270 sexual assault complaints filed at bases in Okinawa over a period of eight years. When unreported cases are included, it is estimated that more than 200 cases of sexual violence actually occurred during each of those years. The danger, pollution, and crime associated with the bases has generated strong opposition, but there is a vocal minority in Okinawa that supports the U.S. presence. We just like to make the same statement they make. So they're gonna stay and they're gonna spend the time putting it on to make a statement, and we're gonna show 'em that we're gonna come out and make the same statement -by taking it right back down. -What statement is that? You know, I'm not sure that there's really a good statement. You know, just showing that they're there, kinda marking the territory. I drive by this back gate all the time, and you see all these protestors out there telling you to go home, you're not needed; you feel unappreciated. But when I came out here today and like, to see so many Okinawans come out to help clean our gate, it means a lot, and I would've loved to see more Marines come out here to see this, to show that Okinawa really does care and want us here. We man a lot of it, we're one of the busiest airports out here for military, and I think that it's important that we're here, and we're doing the work that we're doing. You know, not only to support the humanitarian work, but training for, you know, to protect our country, which is what we're here for anyway, so-- Who are you protecting the country from? Um, you know, out here we are a force in readiness. So if something was to happen out here, within 24 hours we could be there taking care of our country, making sure that it's not gonna get all the way back to our homeland. So, you know, it's good to be stationed all over the world like we are. That force in readiness, there ready to fight when it's gonna happen, so-- - Thank you very much. -Absolutely. - Have a good day. -You too. Here at Henoko at the site of the planned Futenma replacement base in the waters off Camp Schwab, the standoff continues after nearly two decades. At stake is whether the U.S. military will reduce its presence in Okinawa or remain entrenched there for many years to come. Opponents of the new base include the current governor of Okinawa, the mayor of the city that includes Henoko, and virtually all elected officials. A full 80 percent of the Okinawan population wants the Marine base removed from the island entirely, but the U.S. and Japanese governments have insisted on the plan to build the new base. While the sit-in continues on land, others take to the sea to defend this pristine bay, which is a treasure house of natural life and beauty. Four hundred types of coral form the healthiest coral reef ecosystem in the Pacific, and the bay is home to 1,000 species of fish, as well as the feeding ground for the endangered dugong, a relative of the manatee. Viewing the construction site from the sea, it is immediately apparent how massive a base is contemplated. Some 35 million tons of earth are to be dumped in the bay to construct two runways, each over a mile in length, and a naval port rising ten meters above the sea. One of the many international observers to raise objections to the base construction plan is Morton Halperin, the American diplomat who negotiated Okinawa's return to Japan in the late 1960s. After visiting the proposed base site, Halperin joined former governor Ota at a symposium in Naha to discuss Okinawa's future. When I first started working on Okinawa, Okinawa was run by the American military as if the whole island was an American military base. And the million or so Okinawans who lived on the island were treated as foreigners who happened to live on an American military base. So from my perspective, the change is extraordinary. Okinawa is no longer an American military base. For the American military, they still don't believe that reversion took place. The literal terms of the agreement were carried out. That had extraordinary importance, uh, for life on Okinawa, and the freedom of Okinawan people, and their ability to be part of Japan. But it left in place a base structure which no sovereign government would have ever permitted any other country to build on their territory. Why the hell man can't get smart enough to give up war and warfare as a solution to his problems, it just boggles my mind. And I asked that question of, uh... ...down in Washington, D.C., at the Veterans Conference. Why can't man--but it was explained to me that it is inherent in the human nature to go to war. Isn't that a shame? And if you're a pacifist, some people think you're a kook. Isn't that true? ♪
