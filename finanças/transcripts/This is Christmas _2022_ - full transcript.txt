It's November. I think it was Shakespeare who once said 'A stranger is just a friend you haven't met before'. I blame the Americans. Maybe it wasn't Shakespeare. I think I might have read it in a fortune cookie. Anyhow, I like to believe it's true. There's so much more that connects us than makes us different. Perhaps we should offer the odd random "hello" a bit more often. Who knows, maybe the old fella next to you in the Post Office queue hasn't spoken to anyone all day. A casual "how are you doing?" might be a real tonic. Maybe we should try it. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? Tickets and railcards, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm in the wrong jacket. There's no dress code. Just need a ticket. No, I left work in a rush. But I've got one. It's a season ticket. You know that. I see thousands every day. I can't remember them all. I need to charge you full price single. No, I can't. I have a ticket. You've seen it hundreds of times. If a tree falls in a forest and no-one's there to hear it, it still needs a ticket. That's £40, please. Look, I don't have the money. Please. You know I have a season ticket. You know he has a season ticket. Well, he doesn't today. So you admit you know he does have one? Yeah, we all do. We see him every morning, except for Fridays. I go in early. So leave him alone. OK, OK. Look, maybe it's in another pocket, OK. I'll go and do the rest of the train, and maybe you'll find it by the time I get back. OK? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. I don't think he's coming back. But really, you never know what someone's story is. Maybe we'd be better people if we tried to find out. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. No, that was my fault. Sorry, the presents. My phone. Sorry, I didn't see you there. That's OK. Lucky you had that thing on. Yeah, I don't actually own a bike. Is it OK? It'll be fine. It's been through worse. You're way ahead of the game. Hope you haven't spoilt me. Just getting you what I got you last year. You could get them a box at the opera. Nothing German. And, er, Chelsea tickets for the trading boys. Woody. Here's your ball. Actually, hang on. Make it Crystal Palace. Might teach them some humility. Thanks, Deb. Alright, bye. Hey, Ads. I had a religious moment on the train. Oh, yeah? Did you see Jesus in a window seat? This guy had forgotten his ticket and the conductor was being a dick but everyone really stood up for the kid. Stuck it to the man. It's how I imagine the French Revolution started. Not sure about that. But just then everyone looked really, really, familiar. And then I thought, why are we not all, like, friends? Well, maybe not friends, but, you know, the odd hello? Oh, no, never engage on a commute. That's page number one. Because you'll find out that the guy sitting opposite you is some holocaust-denying, evangelical Christian. So young and so cynical. I'm serious. Trust me. Right, I have to get back into town. What? Yeah. Bahrain's just flown in. The whole country? Yeah, probably. I'm gonna stay at my place tonight, alright? Amanda... See you later. Bye. I had a thought last night. Uh oh. Do you think we've become a bit stale? Predictable? Well, you have. You landed on that turned up jeans and white Converse combo back in 2010 and you've stuck with it ever since. I meant our campaigns. Maybe we should try another angle. Look, no, no. Like... no, no. Being asked to pitch on this is huge for us. This shop spends millions on their Christmas ad. It's a national bloody treasure. But the brief this year? Guerrilla style, edgy, trying to catch a real moment. And they've waited until now. All their competitors' campaigns are already running. Yeah, well, they say that, but really what they want is a kid and snow and a talking unicorn under the staircase. I've got another idea. No, we've got an idea. We've got all these boards. If we go in with what we think they want, we'll never get it. Adam. But really... ..you can never know what someone's story is. Maybe we'd be better people if we tried to find out. Like I said, a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet. It's an ethos that I think chimes with what this store has been doing for centuries. Thank you. I... ..don't get it. Sorry, Miranda? Your idea is basically to invite a group of random people... That already share something. Residents in the same neighbourhood, or folks who use the same park. To invite them to a Christmas dinner and you film this-Car crash. I was thinking 'celebration'. This event. To prove what exactly? That there's more that unites us than divides us. Oh. Oh, Adam. It's forced fun and no-one likes that. Sorry, but thanks for pitching, boys. Tell the guys at Blancmange they've got it. I want it locked and on air in a week. Maybe save this for next year. I'm sure the guys at Frozen Foods will love it. What the heck was that? Your idea would never have worked. People go to parks because they're there. Not so they can all get to know each other. Sorry, Paul. We'll have to close the office and give the guys an extra couple of weeks off. We still have the Anderson job to deliver. Agh, the Anderson job. Why did we take that? Need to keep the heating on. Or we should just connect you to the radiators and run them on hot air. All packed. Better go now so I don't miss the flight. So, if you FaceTime me about 11, you'll catch me before I leave the office and I'll catch you getting ready for bed. Don't be that guy. I cannot wait until we're across that pond and I get you all to myself. Love you. Happy Christmas. Can't believe you're going. New boss has got the whole company out there for Christmas Eve. I can't miss it. Could have said no. And you could have come to Chicago with me. You said it was for employees only. No, I didn't. Laptop. You know our big pitch? We didn't get it. I mean, your idea stunk, so... The wind beneath my wings. It did not stink. See, you live in this rose-tinted myopia. Like moving here. Just because people say hello to you in the street, doesn't make them any nicer. Doesn't it? No. They're only saying hello because they haven't seen anyone all day. Anyway, I bet you're secretly pleased that they didn't go for it. What? Well, you like the idea of something far more than actually doing it. Is that what you really think of me? It's not what I think, babe. It's who you are. Apologies, everyone. We are being held here. I will let you know as soon as this problem is resolved. Relax, son. What's the hold-up? There's a signal problem up ahead. Do we know what caused that? Well, sir, I'd say privatisation by Maggie Thatcher, milk snatcher, 30 years ago. That's why you pay more than anyone else in Europe, my friend. Uhh. Hi, everyone. Um... can I just have your... Hi. Morning. Chairman. My name's Adam King, and I just thought as we have a minute, I'd take the opportunity to say something. I've been thinking this for a while now, and, well, seeing how everyone got all Spartacus a few weeks ago, when the young man couldn't find his ticket, well, it just made me wanna try something. We get this train together, most of us, every morning. Same train, same journey, same faces. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's a bit daft we don't, you know... chat. Well, some people think it isn't possible, but maybe it's time we got to know each other. So, I thought that being the season of goodwill and all that, I'd like to invite everyone on this train to a party. A Christmas party. Just for us. A little get together. After a year of delays, cancellations, fare increases, and, of course, our worst nightmare... Replacement bus service. You've got it, brother. The replacement bus service. Been through that hell together. We deserve a bottle of beer and a sausage roll for that alone. So, um... Yeah, just, er... ..think about it. A miracle at Christmas, folks. The signal is working so, as you were. Are you serious? They're strangers. I know one of them. She's the one- No, staring at some woman's cleavage and then nodding a hello when she catches you looking is not knowing someone. Got some doughnuts. And what happens when it's a disaster? When no-one shows up? You said it never would have worked and I think it really would have. Jeez, the force is strong with you, isn't it? Custard ones I have. Why would someone do that? Hasn't he got any mates? I think it's lovely. I see these people every day and I'm always trying to suss out who they are and what they're about. Like there's this one old guy who's got a shopping bag with a tupperware box with his sandwiches in it. Once a week, he pops in a biscuit. Always a Snowball. Never changes it up. And I think is this, like, a treat to get him through the hump of the week? Or is it for a special someone at his work? This is the stuff you think about? ♪ Let's Get Together This Christmas ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ♪ Together with you ♪ Oh, oh, it's Christmas ♪ Together with you ♪ Let's get together this Christmas ♪ Oh, baby, let's get together this Christmas... Party guy. Hello. Hi. We are sorry to announce the 19:40 service to Langton has been cancelled. Great! Anything? No. I guess everyone's trying to get an Uber this time of night. I've got a company account at one of those private car places. Very fancy. What do you do? Got a little advertising agency. Would I know any of your stuff? If you buy cat litter you might. Or if your nan has a bath with a door in it. Someone's gotta do it. Hey, do you have a car that can pick us up from Liverpool Street station and take us to Langton? Yeah, happy to wait. Thanks. There's a cafe across the street. Sorry. Closed. Any chance we can wait for our taxi? Just until I've closed down, yeah? Thanks. So, what do you do? I cook. Hey, I cook, as well as writing cat litter ads. So, I win. Until the new year. Then what? Chicago. You're doing a musical? OK, you win. The city. New year. New life. I'm moving. Really? Yeah. That's fantastic. I envy you. I could never do something like that. So you're really serious about this Christmas party? Never been more serious in my life. Which I can see reflects badly on me, but... Do you fancy a drink? I've got a couple of bottles of IPA. Some Senbei crackers. And some cannolis. Sorry. Is that OK? No worries. Christmas, innit. You eat better out of your handbag than I do when I'm throwing a dinner party. Just little perks from suppliers. You must get plenty of freebies. Got a few gallons of anti-freeze back at my office if the IPA doesn't hit the spot. What do you reckon they're like? The other folks on the train? I always wonder. You know the city guy? Handmade suit and Masonic pinky ring. I always saw him as this self-assured giant of industry. And then, one day, I saw him in B&Q. He was looking at pipes and stuff. And he looked completely out of his depth. Totally incompetent. I can imagine. I'm always making up their life stories based on what they're reading. You know the kid who forgot his ticket? Yeah. Science fiction usually. So I have him as a dreamer. More comfortable in his own mind than the real world. That woman with the bob's always reading. She uses her book like a shield, says 'don't talk to me'. Loner. Then there's the romantic. Jane Austen and DH Lawrence. So, I mean, basically chick lit but too much of a snob for Marian Keyes. I don't know whether to be impressed or terrified. I'm not the one throwing them a Christmas party. Maybe you can help? You seem to know what they're like. No, I'm just guessing. But if you got to know them, then you really would know what they're like. ♪ They're slugging it out at the station ♪ Laden with last minute bling ♪ The poor get ignored ♪ And the stores are at war And the registers guiltily ring...

Come on, you're brilliant at small talk. I knew there was a reason we were together. Baby, I know you think this party idea is stupid, but I've put it out there now. I have to deliver. You're such an idiot. Look, this little party, I think it's really sweet, babe, but my job is important to me. ♪ I swear I saw it coming off the snow ♪ Just wanted to say thanks. For throwing the party? God no. Not that. Just that time with the conductor. Never felt as if I could speak to you... ..but now I have. Well, you know. But really... it's him you should be thanking. Thanks for helping me the other day. Oh, it's alright. I know what it's like. Yeah. I got chucked off a bus once. Did you? Right outside Liverpool. Yeah, I was trying to get back and kicked me off. Cheers. Morning, cowboy. Hello. I think they're expecting an update. Er... ..morning, folks. Hello. Just, er, to let you know that the inaugural Langton Line Christmas party will be on the evening of the 22nd, if that suits everyone. Oh, er, and... ..well, maybe a show of hands might be helpful. Yeah. Oh, yes. It's a start. And intimate is-is good. And if anyone changes their mind or wants to help? Everything is sorted apart from the food and the drinks, and the music, and the venue. So, um... Yeah, well, if you've any suggestions, you'll find me in my office here, seat 35 aisle um... Good. Thank you very much. That was great. Are we not going? Are you serious? Yeah. Look at them. Just pensioners and lunatics. Yeah. Let's just stay at home watching telly instead with your mum and brother because we never do that. What are you doing for Christmas? You going to family or...? No. Not this year. No. I'll get down the community centre. They do a good lunch there. It's just me and mum. We get one of those giant turkey drumsticks. Oh, the giant drumstick. Very nice. Does us fine. You not fancy it? The party? Fella must have a screw loose. I went to a Christmas party once in the Savoy Hotel. They had reindeer and snow falling in the ballroom. What a night. I was your age, about. There were these girls there. Polished, fine, handsome women. One of them, Deborah Swan, asked me to tea at her house. Did you go? I did. We had tea, cakes, then champagne, Christmas, New Year. She kicked me out on the 3rd of January. We got married 6 months later. It's hard to imagine an old man was once a young man, isn't it? What are you asking Santa for this year? Last year I got this bottle of cologne that had been on the Titanic. I did hint fairly heavily for a toasted sandwich maker, but... That's nice. Amanda loves presents. She has this thing about getting everyone something they would never have thought of. Your wife? Girlfriend. Yeah. She has a list of what she'd like, so... Well, at least you can't get it wrong. That's true. And she does do this really rather brilliant, open-mouthed surprised face when she opens them. Bit like the face I make when I pay for them. You should go off list this year. Don't know about that. Go on. What would you get her? Maybe a chicken. Frozen, or...? No. For the garden. For eggs. Like a hen? Yeah. Oh, that's, that's lovely. Simon's always been a... vouchers man. So there's, um... a Mr Chicago? Which is great, you know, at least that way I get to... Choose. ..yeah, what I really want. So... that's nice. It's a shit present. I should get back to my seat. I'm sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. Um, you need to get a pair. If you get a hen. They get lonely. Lunch? Yeah, let's go. Emma works at this place, One Bell. We could try that? What, that woman who gets your train? You keep banging on about her. No, I don't. You know, to be honest, I think, I think it feels a little bit disloyal. Jesus Christ almighty, Paul, she's just someone I get the train with. I'm talking about Tarek's falafel van. That's our Tuesday go-to. I'll be one sec. You're all embarrassed. Hi there. Adam? It's, er... Yes. It's, um... Dean. Dean. Paul, Dean. Hi. Hello. So you boys on lunch, then? Yeah. I've had mine. We should- When you said about helping I thought if you need like an invite type thing, I made this, this morning. It's a bit rough, but take it away and maybe... You probably weren't thinking... Thanks. I'll get back. So that's the quality of your guests right there, is it? Well, I hope he's not sitting next to Elton and David. Is this for table six? Yeah. Is that train guy? Risotto? That's mine. Thank you. Enjoy. That was very, very good. That was fantastic, Emma. And I'm a meal deal kinda guy, so I know what I'm talking about. Thank you. This place is amazing. I assume you've bumped a few folks and booked in for the 22nd? Sorry. Oh, here. We, er, bumped into Dean. Dean? The lad who forgot his ticket. Sci-fi dreamer. Said he's done an invitation for the party. OK. Wow. It's beautiful. Unbelievable. "How is my day?" What is wrong with this guy? Who would have thought. I know. You have no idea what people are like. Look at you. Oh God. What about me? Well, you're always on your phone. Then the other day you stood up and made that announcement. It surprised me. You surprised me. I'm sorry about this morning. It's OK. You're right. It is a shit present. I think we might need to start hustling. Otherwise it's just gonna be me, you and Picasso. Anne was full of regrets, wasn't she? Noticed you're a Jane Austen fan. Have you now? Don't be like Anne. This is about your party? You don't have to stay long. OK, we're in. Are we now? Yeah, why not? Boy's a smart one. Remember that Christmas when the boys were tiny? Fay cooked the turkey the night before. What? Everyone's using the gas at the same time on Christmas Day. I don't like to risk it. Anyway... Did it on Christmas Eve, then my other half comes barrelling home at midnight, three sheets to the wind, helps himself to a leg of turkey! No! I had to tell the kids it was a rescue turkey. It only had one leg. My, um, my partner does this thing. Um... every year she puts an envelope on the mantelpiece on December 1st, and I open it on Christmas Day. What's in it? It's empty. Years ago, we were in a supermarket on Christmas Eve. This old lady was buying a turkey dinner for one and a mini Christmas pudding. And when it went through the till, she didn't have enough for the pudding. Had to put it back. And she looked absolutely shattered. So, Sally helped her with her trolley and slipped a £20 note in with her shopping. Sweet. She joked that she had it to put in my card. So, every year she's found someone, or some cause, and... ..and just given them something. Meanwhile, I get the empty envelope. Mind you, how do you know? I mean, that she actually does it. Because it's Sally. Andy? Andy? Andy? Adam. Adam. I was talking to my PA about this party nonsense. She suggested we let you use one of the venues we just acquired, if you're looking for a place to hold it? Really? Yeah. Come and take a look. Wow. They've closed it again. Thanks. Alright, son? 40 minute delay. Oh, bastards. Fancy a drink? Yeah. Come on. Cheers. It's alright. It's still hot, look. Yeah. Lovely. It's great, this. I got this for my grandson. Market? Yeah, yeah. Quality. Yeah, I was pleased with it, aye. Eh. It's alright that. Yeah. So, how old is he? Oh, he'll be 12 now. Isn't it a bit young for him? Forget that. It's great. Yeah. Where are we off to then? Wait until we get there. What are you doing for the big day? On my own this year, Simon's stuck out there. But I've got figs, a goose, a bottle of Talisker malt whiskey. I'm gonna put dinner on and watch Die Hard in my pyjamas. Haven't told anyone I'm on my own. Why not? I don't wanna get invited anywhere. Wow, I'd love to meet your family. No, they're lovely, it's just with moving, I'm kinda looking forward to having the day to myself. Cook what I like, do what I want, you know. You don't wanna spend it with friends? Most of them have moved away and we don't really see much of them, so... You know what it's like. How about you? Amanda's booked us a table at Claridge's. Wow. Very swanky. There is nothing swankier. We're a pair of swankers. Turkey foam and Brussel sprout spritzer, is that your thing? Apparently. Oh, any luck finding a venue? I called a few places. Well, 32, actually. It's an absolute nightmare. No wonder Mary and Joseph couldn't find room at the inn. Everywhere is completely booked for Christmas parties. I've got somewhere. That's not funny. You know that, right? I'm gonna see it tomorrow if you can make it.

Yeah, he's just being a grinch. He is a big sweetheart really. You were brilliant, by the way. Oh, thanks. I love your ring. It's beautiful. Uh, I actually forget I'm wearing it. Tiffany's? Mm. No, Michael got it in a toy shop for me on our first date. He told me it would keep me going until he got me a proper one. You two are such a cute couple. Er... Thanks. People tell us that all the time. Aw, not surprised. Your kids will be gorgeous. Yeah, we are planning on six. Wow, really? Mmm. No. No, we're not. We're not actually... No, we're not with... My God, I'm so sorry. No. Yeah. We're just train buddies. Your kids will still be gorgeous. Yeah. It's a bit old-fashioned, but I like being walked home. This you? That's me. East of England girl's figure skating champion two years running. Wow! Nearest I got to winter sports was skidding down the railway cuttings on a tea tray if we got a bit of slush. I used to do that. I had this Charles and Diana royal wedding beer tray. Really flew. My coach found out about it. Made my dad throw it away. In case I got injured. Hated her after that. So you were really good? Yeah, I was. And then I used to fall in competitions on purpose just to piss her off. What? Always at the last moment, and enough to drop out of the medals. And then I discovered the Jaegerbombs and boys and chucked it all in. Wow, that's a really inspirational story. You should go round schools with that. It wasn't fun any more. You know, if something isn't fun what's the point? The Christmas party is fast approaching. Anyone else wanna put their name down? There's a band and everything. Or if anyone can help with decorations or food, anything? No pressure. It's got to be fun. If it isn't fun... then what's the point? Listen, I might be able to help get the drinks sorted. Really? Just-You're hardly turning down help, are you? Too right we're not. I'll catch you when we get in. Great. Thank you. Maybe it is a bit young. The thing is, I don't know what to get him. I haven't seen him since he was a baby. I get him a present every year. Just in case. I wasn't a good dad. I was doing OK, you know, successful and that. Then it all went wrong. Started drinking. A lot. Bloody-Bloody cliche I was. Debbie left, took the boy, and... ..he grew up being told his dad didn't love him. I got a Christmas card one day with a picture of a... ..of a baby in it. And it was first time I knew I had a grandson. I turned up one Christmas day, you know, loaded up with presents. I'd had a few to... settle my nerves, you know. Not a good idea. I didn't make it into the house. Patrick took one look at me and... And you haven't seen your grandson since? No. No, I gave up the drink after that. I moved down here to be close to them. I tried talking to my daughter-in-law when Patrick was out, but... ..seems it was worse, you know, going behind his back, so... Yeah. Do you think they'll take it back? If they don't, I'll buy it off you. My cousin will go mad for that. I've persuaded him to come. But he's used to a certain level of Christmas party, so... ..it better be good. This is the place. Venue sorted, I think you'll find. Just taken it on, actually. Thinking of using it for our corporate dues and the like. Reckon it will work? Well, I was hoping for elegant and sophisticated, but I don't mind slumming it. Emma? Don't let him have it, Jonathan. No, least we can do. Really big on charity stuff. That what we are? I shall book it in. Seriously, you don't wanna know how much we spent acquiring this place. Still, knocked a quarter of a million off our corporation tax. Really? James, you old dog. I wanna book out our entertainment space for a little soiree. Oh, shit. Yeah, sorry, mate. Yeah, I meant to send you that earlier. What do you reckon? It's nice. Yeah. Big. It's very big. Right, let's get the drinks sorted. Try not to get too pissed up. Try this. I'm sure you don't need to know about its tone or its body or its length. I'd only get jealous. Very tasty. You can have a few cases of this, on me. Sally's favourite. Thank you. That was a good day. Getting there. Yeah. The black one looks great. Adam. Sorry, I was just talking to our hospitality guy last night - I need to calm him down a bit. It's gonna be a quiet affair, right? More of a reception than a... rave? So far there are only 8 of us, so I don't think anyone will be taking a 7 iron to the glassware. Great. Don't worry, it's fine. It's such a good idea. Actually, Jonathan, um... been thinking about it. I think we'll pass on the venue. Oh? Yeah, I just worry. It's so lovely. And Emma will end up dancing on the bar and punching the air to Mr Brightside, and I'll be all like "Argghh, mind the veneer". Maybe save it for next time. Honestly, forget I mentioned it. It's fine. I have somewhere else lined up. Thanks though. Whatever you think. You're in business, right? Yeah, last time I looked. Michael's got this interview for a really big finance company. And maybe you can give him a few tips? Suzy, it's OK. He's actually got a really brilliant proposal for it. You wanna pitch it to me? Not really. Go on. He might be able to help. Well... I have this theory about plastic supermarket bags. Everyone thinks it was environmental lobbying that got the supermarkets to ditch them, but I reckon it was some maverick guy on the inside. He's ahead of the game. He knows single use plastic is on the way out, but he can make it profitable. He goes to his boss and says, "Look, we need to stop giving away plastic bags, so let's show our customers our big green balls and tell them to bring their own bags. We look responsible and we save a small fortune." But then the really clever bit... we bide our time. Then after a few weeks, when everyone's forgetting their bags, we sell them. We sell them something we used to give away for free. A bag for life, madam, like you bought last week. Very good. Don't they give the money to charity? The profit, yes, but not the capital cost. So, it's a proposal for the retail sector? That's just a catchy example to introduce the premise. It's about culture change within business. How maximising profit and a green agenda are not mutually exclusive. It's not the worst idea I've ever heard. Thanks. Be after my job next. That's the kid. Tickets and railcards, please. Michael's a smart cookie. Yeah, unlike you. Why did you do that? Cancel the room? The party's in four days, Adam. Well, when he mentioned it reduced their tax bill... I know you were thinking it too. It's not the right place. Not for what we're doing. Tiny protests. Why did I do that? It's in four days. I'll pop by your office after work. We'll sort it. ♪ Better that it's Christmas time ♪ Lights shining Lights shining ♪ So much joy Better that it's Christmas time ♪ If you get any cancellations, bell me back, will you? Cheers, boss. There's nowhere available. Did you win this? I did. It's from the Dry Cleaning Association Media Awards. Wow. Third place in the best print category. Let's just call Jonathan and see if his place is still free. It's the easiest thing. That you sorting it? Don't take any notice of me. No, it's just... That's what I've always gone for. The easiest thing. And I can't help but take notice of you. Is that a projector? Yeah. Got loads of old movies. We all used to sit up here at night and watch them. Can I see? Motor's burned out so it just sits there. That's basically a metaphor for my whole career. Why don't we just do it here? The party. Don't think so. They'll be expecting more than me just pushing the desks against the wall. What's up there? Come. I'll show you. Beautiful. Yeah. Never really lays any more though. You ever get the feeling like you're not really living? You know, like your life's just about to begin. All the time. You know why I bought my house? Our village has one of the best schools in the country. You wanna have kids? Some people wanna make it on to the board. Some people wanna have their own company. Me? I wanna have a kick-about. Amanda feels the same? You don't wanna talk about it? It's OK. It's none of my business. No, I'd only bore you. And you've got a whole new life to go and do. When I was about 15, I really wanted these pair of trainers for Christmas. Mum found some at the market, but with four stripes. Oh, that's terrible. She might as well have bullied me herself. You got your mum's present yet? I did her a drawing. Um... I'd love to get her something really good, though. She never gets anything. But after I pay rent and my season ticket, I'm skint. I got a great present once. Paul McCartney gave me his jacket from the Sergeant Pepper's cover. What did you get him? Pound of sirloin. Poor fella hadn't had a steak in years. Talking of which, why don't you come for your tea tonight? I've got a pie that'd be grand for the both of us. What kind of pie? Steak and kidney. You thinking mash? Mash and peas. Sounds good. Great. Snowball? Yeah. So, I'll see you later for tea, then? Alright, son. What time do you want me round? Seven? Yeah. Sounds good. I gotta rush off. But, I'll see you later. Alright. You know that outside chance of a cancellation? Not happening. Oh, it was a ridiculous idea anyway. Such a sentimental dick. I think we should do it here. It's about the people. Think about it. We could have the band over there. Bar in the corner. Put up some tinsel. It will be magical. Don't give up on it, Adam. Ho ho ho. Amanda! Oh, is this the planning committee? Amanda Franklin. Oh, sorry. Amanda, this is- You must be Emma. Yes. Hi. He told me that he had a little helper. That's me. Great. Babe, it's my mother's thing tonight. You haven't forgotten, have you? Forgotten? Who? Spaghetti brains over here. Course I have. Er... I have a shirt here somewhere. It's nice to meet you. Yes. Merry Christmas. You too. Hope you get a chicken. I say I forgot. I didn't forget as such. I just didn't remember. I don't get many visitors, so I never quite get round to sorting the place. You know. Er... Yeah. Right, um... Yeah, you, er... Here, make yourself at home. I'll get the dinner on.Thanks. It's clean. You know, I know there's a bit of mess, but, you know, it's... it is clean. Yeah, sure. Wow. Hey, I've got Hawaiian Crush or American cream soda. In fact, you have the cream soda. You're the guest. That's you? I've been doing a lot in crypto. We're actually going big in the non-fungible token space. Is that the really dull tent at Glastonbury? NFTs not your bag, Adam. Come on, you're an arty type. Well, I prefer my art fungible. Like Cezanne's apples. I love those. And now Hero's announced he wants to board like his brothers, we need the money. Don't have kids. School fees these days are ridiculous. Really? Tim. You don't actually need to pay. But if you can afford it, wouldn't you want the best for your kids? Anyway, I don't want kids. Well, you say that, but... Oh. Sorry, you'll have to excuse Adam. Telling me what I think is his favourite thing to do. Yeah, I was at the top of my game for about five years. Mostly at Liverpool. We won the European Cup in '78, the League the next year, then the European Cup again in '81. You got the medals? I don't bother with them. Well, not any more. Can I see them? Yeah. Um... It's been years since I looked at them. Feels like it was someone else. Yeah. Hey, what a night that was, my boy. We thumped Real Madrid in Paris. Had a few after the game and I threw up in Kenny Dalglish's hat. Great times. These must be worth a fortune. Yeah. We all looked sharp, you know. All of us. Had the Savile Row suits, up town at the weekend. I was a shoo-in for the England team. Then I got injured and that was it. Career over in a couple of seconds. Really? Yeah. This Tottenham striker was winding me up, you know. I was always a bit impetuous, that's what some commentator used to say. I went in to take him out. It was me that ended up with a broken leg. No. Yeah. That was it. Plummeted like a brick. Woke up one morning with yet another hangover and my life all gone. Puff. Yeah... A few snaps. A few baubles. That's it. Hey. Thanks for coming over, Dean. That's alright. Quality pie. Hey... have you got some threads sorted for the party? Er, not really. Just my work shirt. You can borrow something. Hold on. Ray, it's fine. Wait until you see this. You know what this is, don't you? Amanda, er... Yeah? Oh, boy... Listen, I've been thinking. Since I moved out of town, it feels like we hardly see each other. Yeah, we're busy. Like... like people are busy. Don't make the time, though, do we? It's easy, and... ..maybe that's fine. Maybe that suits us. We're not... making demands on each other all the time. Yeah. I always thought that was a good thing. What if it isn't? I can't do this any more. OK. Is there someone else? There's always someone else. Maybe I'm someone else, now. Oh well, I'm still the same girl that you proposed to on the night you met me. I was tying my lace. You are the same girl. Yeah. Come here. I couldn't believe it when they asked me to come back just for some dinner thing. Still, I made them fly me first class. And you get to see me. And I get to see you. And we can spend Christmas together? Yeah. Couldn't get me a flight until Boxing Day so I'm missing the damn Christmas Eve party. Still, you are going to love this dinner. They spend an absolute fortune. When is it? 22nd, I think. I've got something. What? No, they've flown me in for this, Emma. We need to be there. That's the night of the train party. Well, you're never gonna see those people again so, what's the point? I know, but it's... Hey, hey. Look, it's gonna be fun. Alright? I promise you. Here we go. It's got all the details on there. Ah, thanks. You know them anyway. There you go. One for you. All the details on the card, work of our very own Dean here. You did this? Yeah. Alright, don't sound so surprised. Thanks. And I've managed to secure an exclusive warehouse venue just by the station. That's lovely, Dean! Thanks. How are you? You OK? I'm very well, thank you. You're a very talented young man. Hi. Two, please. Are you happy to take a seat at the bar? Yeah. These two? And I think Zola will take your order in a second, OK? You're really not getting any better at this cooking lark. Simon's here. Oh. Yeah, flew in last night. Great. Yeah. So you can... spend Christmas together? Yeah. Emma, what do you think of both of these? What are they? We just need a contemporary graphic for a foot cream campaign we're doing, so... Feet and cream. Hi, Emma. I've got your... Hi, Dean. It worked out great- Thank you, Dean. You alright. Hey guys. What's this? It's a campaign we're doing. Oh, A-Gel. I thought it said angel. I like angels. You can draw right, Dean? I do a bit. He's done one invitation and you're making out like he's Matisse. He's probably just a kid with an Art GCSE. He might not be after 3 years at art school and a decade in the business. Exactly! Yeah, but his talent will be the same. His craft might be better. His skills might be honed. But talent is talent. Who knows how good he could be. Your little 'buy the world a Coke' campaign's really gone to your head, hasn't it? Andreas? Are you seeing him now? No. I'm batting away his advances, actually. Why? Come on, Paul, take a chance. Alright. I'll take a chance on your Dean, but enough with the life coaching, alright? Deal. Are you sure we don't need more stuff? It's got to look magical. And I've convinced a few of them to help out tomorrow night to get it done. It's all coming together. Yeah, maybe it is. I got you a present. Come. 1978 MX60 drive motor. And Dean had this made. What is it? Have a look. Wow. Wow indeed. How did he...? No idea. He mumbled something about an animation app and a mate in a lab and... We have to stick the ends together to make it loop. Thank you. It's... Wow. I can't come. Simon has a dinner. Probably for the best. It's funny how you think you know what you're doing in life. This party... I thought I wanted to get everyone on the train to be friends. Thought it'd be a good thing to do. Maybe I just wanted to hang out with you. I can't do this. I'm moving to Chicago. All my stuff is in boxes. I think you're like me, Emma. I think you're lost. I really do. I'm not lost. But thank you for judging me. You know, you really need to sort your own shit out first, Adam. Enjoy your party. Right. Bastard! Where's Emma? Dunno. Where's Dean? Dunno. Michael, how did your interview go? Oh, yeah. I didn't get it. Gutted to be honest. That's a shame. Maybe your idea needed a bit more work. The idea was sound, it wasn't that. It's tough out there. My CEO's about your age. He's firing people left, right and centre. Got everyone writing proposals to see who's worth keeping. You done one? Avoided the cull. Thankfully. You two alright? Like proper bah humbug the pair of you. Come on man, you've got a big gig tomorrow. You should have a spring in your step.Yeah. I know there's a danger that there will be more band members than guests, so... ..you might wanna do a quick shout out. Actually, this is the last shout out. You'll all be, er... ..delighted to hear that the inaugural Langton Line Christmas party is cancelled. What? Why? Tonight's decoration volunteers stand down and don't drop off the booze. It ain't happening. We've dodged a bullet. And in the New Year we can all go back to... well, ignoring each other and generally being satisfied with our lives instead of scratching around... ..dreaming dreams we never get round to, starting things we'll never finish and... ..looking for happiness in places where we don't belong and aren't welcome. Hear hear. Yeah. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. We've done so many rehearsals. You've been rehearsing? We've been rehearsing the whole time. All the numbers. Is that it? Come on, Adam. After all you've done, you're just gonna-Michael, it's OK. You heard him. Michael, I've been meaning to ask, did you give your mum that recipe? Oh, yes. Yeah, she says thanks. Jonathan, Fay's boys can do your electrics next week. Is Tuesday OK? Perfect, thanks, Fay. Wait a minute, I think I might have something on Tuesday. Have you forgotten about that sync app I told you about? No, I didn't. And I have it right here. Thank you. Linda, I've got the money for the wine. Oh no, don't be daft, I told you they're just bin ends. Nobody needs to pay for them. Tuesday's great. You know, this actually works, Mikey. Of course it does, bro. See? You did this. OK, we're not at each other's house every night, but... we have something. A recipe isn't much, and a little help ain't everything, but it's, it's something. Thanks. Well, I hate to say it, but the kid's done a good job. What do you think? It's great work. Both of you. A phone call? Am I buying a hat? Hello? I hear you've cancelled. Yeah. Just... Your projection was amazing. Thank you. Emma's idea. Just ran out of time. Sorry. Me, too. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Are you sure about this, Adam? You weren't gonna come anyway, were you? I lost Sally... in April. And it's really hard. We loved Christmas. So I'm just gonna let it pass me by, like a float in a parade. I wouldn't have been much company anyway. Well, it's very Christmassy in here. All the cards and the music. So I'm not buying that... "pass me by, parade float" rubbish. What are you, Barbra Streisand? But it must be really tough. She looks at you... the way I used to look at Sally. I know it might not be... ..but it could be everything. And if it is, you've gotta go for it. You really do. You are allowed to be happy, you know. How did you know... about Sally? Sat on her bench. Read the little plaque. She loved skiving. Her and me both. Can you take the card machine over to table eight as well, please? Hiya, is Emma about? You've missed her. Do you know when she's back in? When she comes home and begs me for her job back. Sorry, I really should get on. Course. Um... yeah, sorry. Merry Christmas. I don't think he's coming in today. You alright, Michael? Hey, Adam. Um... we've got a big gig tonight, and I left my guitar in your office. Do you mind if I swing by at 7 to get it? Yeah, sounds good. I will see you there. Thanks, Adam. See you. The train at platform one is the 17:45 service to London Liverpool Street. Surprise! Just because you weren't coming, doesn't mean we weren't. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing here? I just thought I'd show Miranda what she could have won. I'm sorry if I was a moaning Minnie before, but when I saw what this lot did... I can't believe you did all this. Neither can I.

You alright? You little bastard. You bastard! Did you think I'd not notice? Did you? Eh? After I gave you my hospitality. That pie would have done me for two nights, you little...! Cool your jets down, Ray. You little thieving- What's going on? You better ask this thieving little hooligan. He stole my medals. He stole them. He asked to see them. He bloody cased the joint, and then he took them. OK. Come on. Ray, come on. Let's get you up. Let's get you up. Get off! Come on, let's sit you down. He took them. What's going on, Ray? Well, I... I used to play a bit. Football. I was someone. Not this old man, this... lonely old git. But someone. Like you, Adam. Like Michael there. And all I had left from all of it all of that, is a couple of medals. And he took them. He stole them. Dean? I borrowed them, Ray. Yeah, borrowed them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought they deserved looking after. I thought you deserved looking after. I did it for your grandson. Think he'd prefer it to a fire engine. No offence. No, none taken. Could come with you. Drop it off Christmas Day. Usually at a loose end after The Wizard of Oz. Ray... you're Ray Smythe? You're the man. That unbelievable Liverpool team with King Kenny? Ray Kennedy? Phil Neal? The one footed bloody donkey. Simon. Yeah? Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you actually want to be with me? Jesus, Emma, what is it that you want? Not this. I just wanted to thank you all for coming. That's for Emma, really. She couldn't be here tonight but, um, all this... it was her. And you, all of you. So, um... thank you... ..for keeping the faith when I jumped ship. And, um... ..a quick mention for Linda. Before I had my mid-life crisis yesterday, we, er... ..we all did an envelope. So, Red Cross. Samaritans. Put a bit towards my nephew's bike. Is that allowed? Anyway, thank you all very much. I'll leave it to the pros. Nice one, Linda. Now, this is a proper Christmas party. Had a punch up... ..got our own celebrity guest, and I've got a tenner on one of Little Mix there being the first arse on the photocopier. Thanks Adam, I've met good people. But I'll be damned if Adam's gonna be the only fruit loop here. Suzy, baby. I sometimes think about what would have happened if you hadn't smiled at me in the street that day. And... I get scared. I love you so much. And... this thing has been burning a hole in my pocket for weeks. Suzy, my love... will you marry me? Yes. I think my fiancee deserves a number, right, guys? Yes! Yes! Yes! No, no. I really don't. I'm the backing singer. OK, fine! Fine! Fine! Gosh. Um... I remember we broke up once, didn't we? Not long after we met, we broke up for, what was it, two days. It was a weekend, babes. So, two days.Yeah. And I really, really felt awful. But... I'm really, really glad that I will never feel like that ever again.

Talisker. That's your tipple, right? How did you know? Well, you told me. Thank you. That's... That's really sweet. Hi there. Sorry, I'm Dean. Hi, Dean. This is Ray. He just wanted to drop this off for the boy. Thank you. Sorry for interrupting. Have a really good day. Merry Christmas. I reckon she'll like it, you know. Yeah. He'll probably get it in a minute, you know. Do you ever wonder who they really are? The people down your street? Those half-familiar faces in your local coffee shop. Or whoever sits opposite you on the train every day. Ray! Aren't you just a little bit curious? Might be an amazing artist. An undiscovered talent. Or a true legend whose star simply hasn't been blessed. Hello, mate. Hello. Hello, Stanley. Hello, Grandad. Hello. Thank you so much. Maybe someone who's been having a real tough time of it recently and could do with a friend. Or maybe... ..if you're lucky, someone you were always meant to find. Go on. Say hello.
