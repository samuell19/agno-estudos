Intro drawn by: Screenwriter and director: The store closes around 8 PM. Shop-assisstants go home ten minutes later. While the cashier does the daily accounting, the manager sorts goods. Around 8.30, the manager opens the door to the cashier from the nearby store, who deposits the cash here. She is accompanied by the manager or a shop-assisstant. They deliver the money and leave. The manager then accepts the money from the cashier and takes it to a room behind the store. The window with the view to the yard has bars. Here one can't break in. The safe is solid. The manager holds the keys. The cashier gets changed in the same room. This lady has some horrible legs. After this female rhino applies lipstick to her big head, she returns to the store. The manager sees the cashier out and locks the door. He stays for a while, and fills his bag with goods. There is always some surplus in the store. He also leaves then, and secures the door with metal bars. How much money is there daily? Around seven to eight million. There is certainly more money on Saturday. The safe is very solid. It's questionable if the Kid can open it. - We'll do it, guys. Do you have the tools for it? I open such boxes with my nail or a nail file. Even with a hair grip. Kid, just be careful that you don't screw up. That's my problem, Clay. Finish the speech, you use so many words as Zagorka in her novels. The safe is here. Who lives next to the yard? Some retired officer with his wife. He probably has a machine gun in his closet. We'll let him sleep. I suggest that we break through the wall. Thick as half of a brick. You can make a hole in it like in a tram ticket. Then the Kid squeezes through. Fine. Who lives in the room next to the safe. Some banker, single, and rarely at home. If he shows up, a hook punch will put him to sleep for the next two hours. We can even replace his kidneys after that, and he won't say a word. At 8 PM, the store is ready for our celebration. At 9 PM, the money is in our safe and at 9.30 CET our sweet life begins. We don't go in before midnight, untill all around aren't asleep. That's stupid, Fred. Around midnight every rustle can be heard, while it's noisy at nine. There is party nearby and the crowd will be screaming untill eleven. When the band warms up, we can even use dynamite and no one will hear us. Don't scribble, you aren't in the toilet! Clay is right. Better sooner than later, while I'm still sober. If I drink two brandies, I'll see two safes and I won't know which is the right one. Alright, we'll start earlier. We'll go in at nine. You and I are going to see what's going on in the store. When they leave the store, you'll knock on that banker's door to see if he's at home. If he opens the door, he'll be put to sleep. And, Clay, no tricks. We don't want to call up the hero from the next door. Get up, Kid. Jump and get your lock pick and be in the alley at 8.30. And bring the tools for drilling the hole in the wall. Technology to the people. I'll take a taxi if the board of directors pays for it. You know that I live in the outskirts of LA and the tools are heavy as lead. Take it. Gentlemen, then I'll be going. May I tell my grandpa what we are up to? Don't babble! You should be thinking of how to open the safe. If you were 5 cm smaller, you could squeeze through the lock without picking it. Leave that alone. If we get busted by the coppers, these are reserved for jail. Bye gangsters! This jerk acts as if he is going to a wedding. Do you have some whisky around? I'll check at father's place, if my mother hasn't drunk it all. She is a heavy drinker. Who's in your room? A young homosexual. Boys are much cheaper than girls today. Kafkaesque guy with gentle eye circles. Spare me of your humour. You know that I don't have ears for that. Not only for that, old man. Before leaving, do come that we kiss each other. Is the car in the garage? The car? - Yes. It's a pity. Where's the car? Down, if mum isn't driving it. Greetings! Hi. Your husband is going to Italy today. Is the car in one piece? Who's there? A Siamese cat. It's still crowded. There'll be more money in the safe. What are you looking at? Who's that guy? Which one? The one next to the cashier. He's reading the newspaper... He is not a customer. What if they take the money home? It's unlawful. Could you tell me the time, please? 8 o'clock. How is this grass selling? It could be better. How much for a piece? This one? - Yes. - 500. Carnation... 500? Give me one but not from the last year. No, not this one... that one. Here you are. I have to work three full hours to buy this carnation. What's your job? - I'm a locksmith. Look at these calluses. - What are you dragging? I'm fixing uncle's bathroom tomorrow, so I've taken my boss' tools. Can I help you, madam? How much for a piece? - 500 dinars. These are very nice. Give me ten pieces. Here you are, madam. - Just hurry up, please. Is this your son? This one? So he isn't your son? He is just helping out? That's right, madam. I piss on carnation so that they grow faster. What's your relation to this prankster? What would it be? He is a customer, just like you, madam. One thief is just leaving. It's our turn now. Battle at Waterloo can begin. Guys, where have you been? I thought that the space travel was postponed because of the astronauts' fear. Are you heading to Venice for summer holidays? You put carnation in your pocket so you could stand out? Leave that, Fred. Let's go. Is all the iron in the bag? All except the handcuffs. Pick up that, gentleman. To function, my fingers shouldn't be weary. Join me later, okay? When we collect the prize, I'll buy this jacket. This is a women's jacket, you fool. Women's? - Of course. Flash your right turn signal. The captain is watching TV. The single man hasn't arrived yet. Shut it and no babbling. Do you have the tool to open... - Hush! Open it. Turn the lights on. So this is the gentleman who is hosting us today. In capitalism bankers are much fatter. Are you crazy? Listen, the only way that this commander next door doesn't hear us is that the music is as loudest as it can get. Do you think that this skinny guy who sleeps here doesn't listen to his radio, particularly if there's a woman coming to dinner. I work better when the music is on. Get to work, we didn't come to a concert. You haven't washed your hands for two years and now you've decided to wash them. Sod off. While you're making that hole in the wall, let me eat my dinner. When hungry I can't even break into a suitcase. Where should we make it? The safe... - Down there. - Pick it up. They'll hear us. Now, start pounding, pal. I'll impersonate a woman. Those next door will think there's an orgy going on. Finally he has found himself a woman. What's that racket? It's not coming from his place. Maybe they are building a partition wall in the store. What would they build on Saturday evening? Maybe it's coming from upstairs? Stay at the door so that you can hear if our host is coming. Enough of this foolish behaviour. Clay, forget now about re-educating him! Anyway you can't make a cake from mud. Once in ten years this asshole makes noise and then he breaks walls. I'm going to tell him that this isn't a brothel. Leave him be. Stop, someone is in the hallway. We fooled him, alright. You can go for it now. Yet again he is making noise, god damn it. That squeaking bed is hitting the closet. If he continues handling her in this way he'll break the bed. Come on, man get in the oven. Auf Wiedersehen, guys. How is it going? It's the first time I see something like that. State of the art. I knew that he would screw it up. What are you doing? I'm playing basketball. Is everything going smoothly? Why do you want to know? Listen, do you think that was really a woman's jacket? What jacket? It's done, gentlemen. Well done, Kid. One thing, gentlemen, I'll take the money and go out through the store, while you can wait here for the police. I don't like sharing money if not forced by the law. Just kidding. Should I also collect the change or should I leave it for the trade union. Take it all. There's no noise anymore. Wait for the lover to catch his breath. There's at least 8 million in cash. Two and a half million for each and the rest for the gentlemen's image. I left the carnation back there. Stop fooling around. How stupid. He's right, let it play. Someone is coming. The single man is coming. Clay, as soon as he enters, knock him down. He's with a woman. You take care of her and I'll take care of him. Turn off the lights. Thank you. Something is wrong. - That's not our concern. Hurry up, that guy will be here in a bit. - Shall we leave him some money for the fear he has suffered. - Hurry up. Please, leave it. Let's scatter. Clay, keep it where we agreed. We don't know each other untill morning. Excuse me, madam. Is that a woman's or a man's jacket? I think it's a woman's jacket. But can a man wear it? Of course, these days anyone can wear anything he wants, especially if he is of your age. Thank you. I bow to you. On Monday you'll be mine, my darling. Taxi! And what was that brilliant idea of yours? I suggest five days at the sea. Crabs for lunch and for dinner, Inge, as you wish. But I have one condition... Would you like a breakfast in the room. But I would like you to be good down at the sea. - Of course. We are aware of that, Inge. There will be no flirting, kissing is banned by law, and we'll only see sex in the books we'll bring with us. Make sure to bring your chastity belt and to leave the key to your mother. - Don't be vulgar. I'll wear chastity belt, not to be tempted. Enough. Sorry. One Winston to make you calm. Is anyone else going? Clay is going. That boxer? - My personal bodyguard, stuntman, he can fall on his head from a horse or from a skyscraper. As you wish, baby. He will be okay for Vera. You said that at the sea there would be no... The ban only applies to two of us. Good evening. - Good evening. Please could you tell me where Ivan Majer lives? He should be at number 17. Over there, in the ground floor. Thank you, comrade. Who is that Majer? - I have no idea. His son studies at my faculty. He surely won the lottery, so the cops came to break the news. So, do we have a deal for Monday? Call tomorrow, firstly I have to convince my mum. Okay, my queen. Nighty night. Good evening, do you have any matches? You came home so early, how so? I killed a man, mum. I have guilty conscience. People with guilty conscience run away from the world by crawling into bed like ostriches bury their head in the sand. Where did you read this? You don't believe that your son could be a killer? Why would you kill? You drink too much. When have you seen a serious delinquent who doesn't drink? Tone wanted to kill himself because of Inge. She drove him so crazy, but I'll kill her. Don't talk nonsense, Fred. Do you think I couldn't kill? I wouldn't even blink for a girl like her whose every smile is calculated. When do you have the exam? When I feel like having one. You should behave yourself. This doesn't interest either you or father. You are asking questions just for the sake of asking. When you hear tomorrow that I killed someone, you can with peace on your mind report to the police: "You know, I don't know my son very well. He lives his own life and my husband and I our own." Understandably, you won't tell them that you and your husband have each lived separate lives. Would you stop drinking?! Like mother, like son. I wouldn't be surprised if my father would kill you tomorrow, if he only knew what his wife was doing while he travels around the world. Fred! Fred... ...go to sleep. If you don't want me to tell more lascivious details, you should better go to bed. And have a good cry, so you'll have a clear conscience. ♪ I'm this city's thief, I'm the king of my profession, ♪ ♪ I make fun of the whole world, ♪ ♪ because I'm this city's thief. ♪ ♪ This is my home... ♪ A little bit of poetry please, a little bit of poetry. ♪ ...every day you pass by, ♪ ♪ Hello baby, how are you... ♪ ♪ Who knows how many times we passed this street together ♪ ♪ please tell me with your words that you love me. ♪ ♪ Love me, with your love I'll heal the wounds of my past. ♪ (Speaking indistinctly) What's up, Grandpa? It's Sunday, what's the hurry so early in the morning? I pray you drop dead. Grandpa, grandpa, don't be angry. You should better go to church. I pray you drop dead. Grandpa, what would you like your rich grandson to buy you? Would you like a cigar or a soup? I'm getting a lot money today. Would you like a barrel of rakia? You are lying, I pray you drop dead. Grandpa, I'm not lying. I won the sport bet, and we'll get 2 million on our hands. You are lying, I pray you drop dead. Why don't you wash the clothes? I'll have to marry if you continue like this. You won't marry, I pray you drop dead. Gosh, I'll have to. You don't clean, wash, I have to get married. I'll wash them today. I shall die if I don't wash them. Okay gradpa, I will not get married then. So that's it, you would be afraid of my wife getting rid of you? I'll make you some tea. You are just trying to scare me, I pray you drop dead. We will live like small gods, gradpa. I'll get you a new suite. What colour do you want? Yellow. I swear it, you are crazy, grandpa. Who wears yellow suits? Give me the blue one then. Wash your hands, grandpa. I would like you to buy me one more thing. What, grandpa? I would like to have leather boots. Black or brown? Brown. - Alright. Grandpa. If anything happens to me... I'll bury all the money under that tree. What money? Give me the tea. Even if 100 police officers come here, you still don't know where the money is. Alright. I'll buy you the boots and the suit tomorrow. I pray you drop dead if you are lying. Bye, grandpa. - Bye. The money is here. We made the headlines. Store robbed. Around 9 million dinars taken. Two people attacked by burglars. It is suspected that the same gang has committed more robberies already. Excellent, a gang that is being chased will pay our bill. Yes, but only if we don't pay their bill. Idiot. Hello, guys. - Close the door! Why were you whistling, you idiot. Say to your father that he's an idiot. Clay, leave him! If you tell me that I'm an idiot again, I'll report everything to the police, even if I sit in jail for 10 years. Enough with the fight. Firstly we'll enjoy some sweet life and then we'll call the police. Open the cash register so that I can pay you. Make sure no one comes in. Did you count it? 8,2 million dinars. They reported on the radio that 9 million was stolen. What are you trying to say? That 800,000 is missing from our cash register. Let us not ruin everything now. There'll be time to settle this. And you, shut up! Split the money three ways. Why me? So that there'll be no ill blood. Hide the money! What is it? - Some kid is coming. Hurry up! What is it? My dad is asking for distilled water. Wait, I'll take a look. Here, give it to your dad. - Thank you. Go on. Fred, we should have checked if he can even count up to thousand. That's why you became a boxer, because they only need to count up to ten. Here you are, each of you can grab a pile of money of their own choice. I'm buying the jacket tomorrow. Let's split, gentlemen. Clay, me and you are going to the sea tomorrow at dawn with the 2CV. And you, Kid, could get us a good car. Mercedes or Fiat 125. But you're working tomorrow, gentlemen. And that gentleman should get the car on his own. Be careful that the gentleman doesn't break your nose. Then gentleman, bye, bye. Tomorrow, we must have a car. Alright, but under one condition. Let me hear it. I'll get the car if I can go to the sea. It's a deal. Tomorrow at 7.30 AM at the bus station near the gas station. The schedule is approved. And you, don't frown or I won't take you to the sea. You better get lost. Something is wrong, boss? I don't know, some kind of engine knocking. Start the engine, there surely won't be any knocking any longer. Do you think so? Let's see that. Indeed, there's no knocking. No, no, thank you. It's my treat. Take it, you earned it. Thanks, thanks. - Let's go upstairs for a rakia. No, thank you, I can't do it today. Good bye. Well, what are you looking at? We'll be hanged because of you. Your neck is too strong for hanging, you'll be certainly shot. Listen, grandpa... - What is it? I'll be back on Thursday. Alright. - Don't get married untill then. No way, I won't. This is the money for food. - Thanks, thanks. Bye. - I pray you drop dead. Hey, hey! When you return, there'll be a divine bean soup with bacon waiting for you. Bye. Where are you travelling? You'll be all alone now and you can do whatever you want. I'm still your mother, watch your mouth. What do you want from me? For how long do you think I'll have to listen to two losers. Fred! Don't you Fred me? All my life I listen to lies and hypocrisy of both of you. And now I should bow to such saints. Say what do you want, say it? Do you need money for the road? From you, I don't need. Where did you get the money? From the dear God himself. And dear God takes care of all those left behind. Don't talk nonsense. Do you have everything you need? I have everything, except parents. Fred! - What? Take care of yourself. I know that I and your father are to be blamed for a lot of things. Your father and I don't live together for a long time. Or, in other words, we are living together because of you. Are you finished with your thought? When you'll become a mature man, you'll be sorry for talking to your mother like that.

Hey listen, how much does it cost to stay in this apartment? Twenty-five dollars per day, sir. Couldn't you take something more expensive? Give me a break, Kid. You should better park the car in front. What are you afraid of, I've changed the car plates. The plates from the stolen car are on another car. Where did you get the plates? There are three cars with the wrong plates. I've mixed a cocktail for the coppers. Well Kid, you must be a true genius. Tell this to that dummy. If it wasn't for me, you would hardly see the sea. That one should kiss my feet. You should wash them first. Get up, bourgeois, the ladies are waiting. Thank you. Here you are. Look at that guy, how he is staring at us. What is he sniffing? He is seducing you. The guy is trying to connect. Turn off the transmitter. He gets up. I bow before you. Pardon the inconvenience but I feel obliged to introduce myself. I'm Rikard Hundic, shortly Cico. Why would you be obliged to introduce yourself? Only for official reasons, miss. I'm the manager of entertainment and sports activities at Uvala Scott. I'm at our guest's disposal. If you would like to go water skiing or something else please tell. This means that you are included in the price of the breakfast. This is almost the case, miss. May I have a seat? Only if you have to for official reasons? Sorry. So, how long do the ladies intend to stay? Three or four days. Oh, that's a pitty. I had an intention to organise a beauty pageant at Uvala Scott. Nobody is stopping you in doing so. I must say that last year I choose a full blown monster for the beauty queen. She had two left feet. But you would be a perfect deal. Beauty queen a la carte. Are those guys looking for you? Yes, sir. There are too green for you. Are you also the local psychologist? Sorry, I only stated what's best for you, sorry. Sorry. Never mind. This gentleman is a manager of entertainment activities. Sorry, a little mistake with the introduction. I'm the manager of the leisure activities at Uvala Scott. Cico. - Fred. Rikard Hundic. Cheers. You are... You are surely a boxer? I make no mistakes reading people's faces. And you... You are, you are studying philosophy. Am I correct? What is it, I made a mistake? Among us, he's a locksmith. Sorry, young boy, even computers make mistakes. Why are the ladies so sad? Uvala Scott confuses everyone the first day. Do you have here any genuine rich man? That fatso owns two factories. And the daughter doesn't look bad. She would provide for good dower. You are too late, colleague, this is his lawful wife. You see, Kid, if you had the money, you could buy a real woman. Children at your age don't masturbate. Fred, behave yourself. Sorry. My fiancee is celebrating her birthday. I'm inviting you to banquet and later to the night club. With pleasure, it will be an honour. I'll have to go to the beach, the water skiing is scheduled at 10. If you wish, for this great company water skiing is free of charge. We are coming. So long, young lions. Ciao. - Ciao. Why are you lying about my birthday? I had it three months ago. Vera, then we are going to celebrate your birthday. Alright. It's pretty much all the same. The main point is that we have a reason for a big celebration. Otherwise someone could say that we are spending too much money. The gal is carrying a heavy burden. There you go again. - Sorry. Give me some of your perfume? - Take it. Enough, you'll stink 2 km away. Excellent. Too bad you didn't go to school. You would have become the next von Braun. Had I gone to school, who would have put food on the table. My grandpa haven't had money since birth. The famous family of pickpockets. Whose family? I was just joking, you idiot. You can talk badly about anybody but my mom and dad, otherwise I'll cut your throat in your sleep. Just so you know. Leave him alone, Kid. Clay's father is the king of Zagreb drunkards. When I smash my father's nose wine is split not blood. You two shouldn't get married, you would rarely be in good mood. Let me see the money. Thirty each. Why? I'm paying the bill and you are pretending to be my guests. Is that clear? Clear. Debts paid quickly encourage friendship. You are taking kittens to the sea but I'm paying the bill. Working class is always exploited. And one more thing, gentlemen. If anyone asks you, just so you know, I'm the son of a big shot or, more precisely, the child of a state minister. Is that clear? As far as I'm concerned you can be the Pope's son. Pope doesn't have a son, you idiot. Hello... Can I get the restaurant? Listen girl, we must be careful that they don't get us drunk, because we are finished then. They can pour me as many drinks as they want. All of them will fall under the table earlier than me. You can drink a lot? Yes, only when I'm in my panties, but I don't drink just any drink. Listen, when I give you a sign, just tell that you feel sick and we'll flee to the room. It's the end of the party for the boys then. They didn't drive us here to pick up flowers. Then give Fred to me immediately. We didn't come to the sea for nothing. Clay? That guy plays no role when it comes to me. I'm a frigid as a stone when it comes to such wild species. This one strangles you like a boa that makes love to you. If they go for me I'll fall unconscious. This always works. I'll fall unconscious if they don't. Oh God, you're so silly. Here it is. Sorry. I drink in honour of equality, brotherhood and love of persons of opposite sex. You are an excellent speaker. What did you study? Miss, I graduated from five faculties. When did you find the time to finish the studies? Have you heard of Maxim Gorky? We have hopefully. My first study was life itself and the other four were... - ... night life. Exactly, exactly. Well said, Kid, well said. Every night was one semester of my study of life, miss. If all these nights were added up... I've just enrolled for the first year in the night life studies. Miss, what do you think, how old am I? Fifty-five. You are some kind of a sadist. Sorry, sorry. Because I'm lowering your age. How old are you actually? I'm around forty. I can tell you that you are the first person who gave me that age. Most of others give me between twenty-five and thirty-five. Would the guests of honour like some coffee? We can drink it down in the club. Livio, the bill. Mr. Cico... Yes, please. Which foreign women tourists are the best? What do you mean? Oh, that. Well, German women and Czech women to some degree. Swedish women are too open. You know, they give up too easily and a man feels like being in a shop. However, German women, they do it with no mystification but with some resistance which I would like to call self-sacrifice. You are a true poet. What can I do, professional deformation. She is also an artist. - Really, which genre? Theatre. To be, or not to be... Yes. Go into the woods and kill Snow White. Yes, your majesty. Who has been sitting on my chair? Who has been cutting with my knife? Who has been drinking from my glass? Who has been eating with my spoon? Who has been sleeping in my bed? Hello, boys. Someone is sleeping in our beds. What about good morning first? Red apples, red apples, would you buy red apples? Alright old woman, give me a red apple. Snow White, no, I'm the most beautiful of all! Didn't I tell you so. Hey, shall we split the bill? No, Mr Cico, this is not Yalta. Oh... Livio, it was splendid. The rest is for you. Thank you very much. Then, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to bar. Ah, yes. Let's go. Good evening, dear guests. It's an honour to welcome you in our night club at Uvala Scott, where you'll be entertained this night, as every night, by our popular orchestra the Youths as well as our guest from West Germany, Georgia Cogan. (In French) This wine makes me dizzy. God I hope, it won't stop. Care to dance? May I? Why not, meine Damen und Herren. Kid, don't drink the whisky. What a woman. A whore. Why? She is gallant indeed. Apparently the two of us are now free to pick up strawberries. There are no strawberries here, idiot. What do you think, should I approach the right one? She is one head taller than you, she could breastfeed you. There is a sweet babe in the kitchen, I'll make a move on her. Why are you so cruel to me? Sooner or later, you must say yes to someone. Yet again, you are pestering me. Are you suffering, hotshot? Shut up. Is this seat taken? Hey, waiter, three whiskies! Must be imported from abroad! Would you like a cigar? You have one? So... where did you get all this money? Fred is paying for everything. From whose pocket? His old man is a big shot. Do you like it? Absolutely. So... what does Mr Universe do for a living? He's wasting the days God gave him, and in the meantime he's in film doubling as an Indian. How do you know each other? From boxing. Clay introduced me to Fred and we are now a gang. Weird, you are a locksmith, Fred is studying philosophy, and the third one... Okay, but why are you interested in all of this? Sorry, sorry, sorry... I'm interested in customs, people, psychology of nations and individuals. You know, it is my hobby. Fred is okay but Clay is a born bandit. What? He likes to...? Steal? No, not at all, he likes to fight. - Oh, so. You are okay, okay. So, Fred is attracted to the blondie? He can't open that safe. What do you mean? There are safes everywhere, you just have to have the right code. And you have the right code? Not bad. Sorry, buddy. Cico? May I just call you Cico? Of course, of course. How are you, fine? Yes? - Yes. May I steal the lady for a dance? You're welcome to. Thank you very much. She'll be right back. Hey, can we exchange our dance partners? She speaks German excellently, be careful with grammatical cases. For you, I would betray greater value that is the German woman. I like the premeditated betrayal. Do punish me then with a kiss for the betrayal. I'm not that cruel. Our idol is already halfway through his job with Vera. The other half is far more complicated. This only applies to you, lady. Fred's father is a state minister? Good joke. He isn't? He's medium-sized fish, like mine. Let's go for a drink. I'm not going to take a drop more. You have an emergency invitation to a drink? Okay, I'm coming. May I pick the poison? - Why not. Ivica, give us four Drambuies. What is that? A drink from Olympus, liqueur made from whisky. To me Trenk brandy, I'm a patriot. Hi, Cico. - Oh. Just Cico. - Hi. Ivica, I'll also have a Trenk. Good night. Baron Franjo Trenk, excellent soldier, adventurer, card player, lover and a fan of good wine. Long live gendarme, long live Trenk. Ivica, brandy. Kid, beware of the turns on the road, you are little bit drunk. Be careful. To the bottom. I'm wasted. Don't even think of falling unconscious. Every drop of this drink will offer you sparkling adventure and the legend about Baron Trenk. Miss, in your honour. Should I be jealous now? It's not necessary, but you'll make me a favour. One more round. Ivica, give a Trenk for this gendarme here. Clay. Listen, Clay, what is German freulain saying? Will there be any sex? Is it over? One less virgin. Good morning. That Cico isn't bad at all. What about Fred? Only the first one must stay in your memory. Others aren't important. Come on, cut it out. Cops. Somebody ratted us out. Wake up Clay. I know who ratted us out. - Who? Look, at the fence. Cico. Did you say something to him? Certainly not. Cico heard Vera's confession during the night. Get dressed, what are you waiting for. Where did you get this? It doesn't matter. No shooting. We'll see. We should get away through the kitchen exit. Show us the way. Faster. What about girls? - Let Cico rescue them. Great Wall of China. Shut up. Maybe they aren't looking for us. Maybe the police conference is taking place, you fool. We should get through to the main street. Why are you laughing? We are going to prison and my Cico to the Olympics. He's making a performance for the coppers. Are they armed? They didn't show it to us. And you, poor girls, don't know anything? Only the last night the bill was 120,000. Get dressed, we'll drive you to your mums. Watch out, there's a bomb inside. We are in deep shit, now we can go straight among whores. I deserved it for being so stupid to come here accompanying a virgin. Be quiet. Stop! Dead by the bullet. Hurry up! Get up! Drop that jacket! Come on! What is it? I can't go on. - Get up! I can't go any further. Get up! Get up! Get up, idiot! Get up! Get up already... Leave him alone. - Don't bite. Leave him alone! Get up! You'll pay for this. Get up, both of you! Hide that. It would be better to return to the seashore. Why? We'll steal a motor-boat and leave for Italy. What do you think, Kid? You two go, I can't go any further. I'll speak. - Okay. Good day. Cheers. What good wind brings you here? Do you have any water? - Of course. You are a little breathless, are you sick? Here you are, drink. Where are you headed, young men? My grandpa is of your age. Otherwise he's like a rabbit, when he sees a woman, his underpants fall down of their own will. Are you an Italian? Half-half. My late mother was from Monfalcone and my father was an Istrian, from Rovinj. Look, look at that lion's head. The lion has hurt his leg. Where are your hurt? Here. You know, I was a medic in WW1. A Bosnian guy fought two days at Piave River and didn't know that his leg had been broken. What kind of people... Is it better now? Do not get any closer or I will shoot! Get in there! And you, get in there. Stop or I'll shoot! Should we surrender? I don't surrender. If you shoot, it'll be even worse for us. You, shut up, or I'll kill you first! Get lost! We could make a run for it to that side. What about him? They are going to kill us. We are safer inside. This was just a warning. Surrender, you are surrounded! It would be better to surrender. - You can surrender, I'll get to the seashore, even if I'll have to kill them all. Stop! Get back here! Stop! Don't move! Get out! Poor kid, it looks like he isn't dead. Cuff him. What don't you like about me? I thought I would get caught by a real policeman. Someone like Lee Marvin. Let him run! THE END Translated by: jq0ntuu
