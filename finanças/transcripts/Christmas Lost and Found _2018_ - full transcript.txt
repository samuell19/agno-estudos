Brian? Hi. What are you doing just standing there? I was headed to the airport to pick you up. I get the time wrong? No, I uh... there was an earlier flight and I thought I'd surprise my Grandma, so I rented a car. Wait, why are you coming to pick me up? Frances said she was busy and she asked me to go get you. Here, I'll give you a hand with this. Oh. No, no really I got it. Please! I'm not gonna stand here and watch you drag all this up to the door. Okay. Thanks! Did you make good time from New York? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait! Before I walk in that door, um, be honest with me. Did you ever spill the beans? What beans? Nothing happened, right? You were passing through Chicago on a work trip three years ago and we had dinner together. We had dinner together because Grandma Frances made an elaborate candle-lit meal and 10 minutes before serving it suddenly got sick. It was unfortunate timing. It was a lot of hooey, as she would say. Anyway, she thinks of herself as some kind of a matchmaker and I'm sure she knows that we stayed up half the night talking and almost- -Kissed. We almost kissed? Which would have been crazy considering I was leaving the next day and anyway that night wasn't a big thing, right? You started dating someone like five minutes later. It was four months later. Right. Yes. Becky. Bethany. Bethany. Mhmm. Yeah. How is she? We broke up... about a year ago. Something, that your grandmother no doubt, reported back to you. Did she? Yeah. I don't remember. That, as Frances would say, is a lot of hooey. Look Brian, I'm only here until after New Years. Yeah, always on the move. And during that time we'll be neighbours. And it would be simpler if we kept things neighbourly. Of course. Yeah, you're right. Neighbour. Oh, I can definitely take it from here. No, I'm just being neighbourly. Plus I was invited to dinner. Of course you were. You're stuck with me a little bit longer, but I promise after this I'll stay on my side of the fence. Great. Ah! My Whitney! Grandma! My darling! Oh, get in here! Come on! Come on! You're early. Well, I just couldn't wait to see you. Easiest drive to the airport I've ever made. Well, this is perfect. Because see that box of decorations. That's ours and we can decorate before dinner. Oh, right now? I was thinking I would check some work emails that can't wait. Whitney, it's been a long time since I've had the privilege of spending the holidays with my granddaughter. And since Christmas is just around the corner, I made a great dinner for you; spiced ham and your favourite chocolate cake. Well, Merry Christmas to me. And speaking of which, you two are under the Mistletoe. Grandma. Oh um... y'know what, I am going to go freshen up, after a long flight. I'm gonna go start cooking dinner. You're cooking? You could call it that? Well, I'm teaching him. Someday he'll be my sous chef but in the meantime... I'm just the- the dishwasher and the prep cook. Okay then. Frances? Yes? What? I've missed you. What's this about "work emails". I thought you were supposed to be on your vacation. Well, with emails no one's ever really on vacation anymore, are they? You're always so busy. Are you happy? Grandma, I work for one of the biggest event planning companies in Manhattan. It's basically my dream job. Of course I'm happy. Right. But it is really nice to be spending Christmas here. I love you. I love you too. What is that sound? That is the sound of progress, but Frances is ignoring it. What happened to that ancient flip phone? It finally died and I upgraded it, but you can't learn how to use it if you leave it in a drawer. I know how to make a phone call on it. That's all I need. I don't need a tiny computer. In my youth a hashtag was a pound sign. You know what a hashtag is? Ha ha. And I don't need some robot inside that machine to help me. We used to call a switchboard operator. Human contact, can you imagine. Ha ha. Mmmm. Grandma, you have outdone yourself. So Whitney, you're usually only in town for a couple of days between work trips. What's the special occasion this time? What? I can't come visit my grandma for the Christmas holidays? Her parents currently are on a Caribbean cruise, so I'm the lucky one that gets her and I want to do all the Christmas activities that we did when you were a little girl. Starting tomorrow, I thought we'd go in town for lunch and then look at all the department stores' Christmas windows. Oh yes! Especially Hayes and Company. Oh yeah! What's so special about Hayes & Company? Well, they're the oldest family owned retailer in the city. Hmm. And Mrs. Hayes was a very dear friend of mine. And I understand that her granddaughter is running the store now. I just love that during the holidays they hand out cookies and candy canes to all the shoppers, and everybody lines up to see the window displays. And the next day we can go to Shep's! Mmmm, yes please! Shep's? Oh, Shep Wilson, he owns that winter village store over on Main. Ahhh, that's- that's the place you would go and buy the Christmas ornaments every year. We did. How do you know that? She has a lot of Whitney stories. And I think we're long overdue for a new Christmas ornament, so that I can have a new story. Brian do me a favour, please. Could you go over here on this settee? There's a box and a book on top. Could you bring that here, please? Sure. Just put it right... Yeah, we'll put it right there. Uh-huh. Yeah. What is this? Open it. Oh. All right. Thank you. Oh Grandma! These are all the ornaments we bought together over the years. That's right. Mmmhmm. Oh thanks. This is from when I was seven and everything had to be purple. Oh, yeah, and even then you were so stylish. Look. Purple, purple, purple. My favourite one is... This one. Ah! That's the year that I took you for your first skating lesson. Mmmm, and the year that I broke my wrist. Yeah. Oh Grandma! It's the cookie one. What's... what is so funny? Well, Grandma and I found this one the year that we ended up baking eight different types of cookies for Santa. Eight? Whitney wanted to surprise Santa. But she didn't know what he preferred. So she didn't know if it was sugar cookies, gingerbread cookies, chocolate-chip cookies- So we made them all. Hearing that makes me very afraid to ever be your sous chef, Frances. Oh! The Kennison family tree-topper. Passed down through four generations. And now, Whitney, five. Grandma, you're giving me these? Of course! Who else could I give them to? They're a piece of our Christmas family history and now I want you to have them. And it's perfect timing because we can decorate the tree together. Wow, Grandma, that is incredible. Thank you. But maybe after Christmas you could keep them here for me. Why would I do that? I mean, that's a poor gift to give it to somebody and then take it back. Well, they belong here. And I don't know if I can take them to New York and hang them on my tiny tree, where no one's going to see them. Maybe someday, you might decide to move closer because, in spite of all my efforts, I'm not getting any younger. That may be true Grandma, but my job is in New York. My whole life is in New York. Well, it's a... just a thought. Hmmm. All right, I better help him with these dishes. Ok. Woah! Uh, you could- you could use the other room. But this is my room. I always use this room. Yeah. Y'know Frances has been on a bit of a fitness kick so... I don't know what this box is. Oh. You shipped yourself a box. You pack your entire closet? Well, my bathroom is getting renovated, there's gonna be a bunch of strangers in my apartment for the next few weeks. I just shipped myself some of my special things. Alright, well it's a good thing we're keeping it friendly. Otherwise, I'd have the urge to impress you by helping you with everything. Good luck with all this. Thank you. I think I have it under control. Oh, it was a lovely evening. But you know I'm a little tired. I probably should have gone to bed earlier. I hope I don't come down with something. -Frances. -Huh? You will not be getting sick again and playing matchmaker. Wha- I don't know what you're talking about. Whitney and I are just friends. Okay? Uh huh. Good night. Good morning sleepy head! I didn't want to disturb you by doing my morning workout. Mwah! So my friend, Joan and I, we're gonna go do our speed walk. And I apologize for all this stuff in here. I didn't get to unpack before you arrived. That's okay. Well, usually now, I have breakfast in town with Joan, but I can come back and have breakfast with you if you like. No, no, you go have fun. I clearly have plenty of organizing to do in here. Okay. Okay darling, alright well, I'll be right back, okay. In the meantime, if you need to throw out any boxes, to make space, you just go right ahead. Okay. See you later! Bye. Thanks for the coffee. Sure! Hey! Oh! Morning! Let's do this thing. Whitney all settled in? Oh yeah! Oh good. Do architects always build fences? They're a lot easier than houses, actually. Shouldn't you be working? I am working. Working really hard. Oh. Hey, is today trash day? Yeah. Right. Thanks. You know I'd love to help you but... I gotta stay on my side of the fence. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no, no! Garbage truck came 10 minutes ago. Is anything wrong? Yeah, kinda. Oh! I need a hot bath! Oh, ho! Whitney, what... what are you doing out here in the cold in your bathrobe? I was just talking to Brian. Well, child you're gonna get pneumonia! You know what, you're right. It's cold, you need that hot bath, and we need to get ready for our big afternoon in the city. So I will see you inside. Uh... Come on. Please be here. So... where do you want to have lunch? You know, I think that the uh... bistro restaurant is still there. Oh, yeah. That sounds good. And I believe that there's a tree lot around the corner from the Hayes Company. We can get our Christmas tree and decorate tonight. Yeah. Yeah, we could, uh-huh. Or y'know what we should just enjoy our afternoon. There's no need to rush, right? Right. If not today, maybe tomorrow. Or hey you know what, maybe the next day. We still have a couple weeks until Christmas. Right. Right. A couple weeks until Christmas. You know I remember the first time that I took your father to look at the Christmas window displays. They were all- They're empty. What? What is that about? I don't know, let's find out. Let's. Excuse me. Is Gloria Hayes possibly here? Miss Kennison? Hey! Hey! How are you, Gloria? I'm great. It's so good to see you. Thank you. What uh... what brings you into the store? My granddaughter, Whitney Kennison, she's with me for Christmas. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And we decided to drive into the city and have lunch. And to see the Christmas windows. Ah. I am... just going for coffee. Would you care to join me? -Sure. -Sure. -Yeah, great. -Ok, good. We just finished the store renovations and we want to announce ourselves to our customers with a bang. So I hired somebody new to design the windows. They were awful. We had to take them down and she just stormed off. That's terrible. I know. And now all of our customers are walking right past us to our competitors and I'm left to figure out how to get them back before it's too late. Whitney, Frances mentioned that you're a fancy event planner. New York City, right? She certainly is. She brags about me too much. I'm thinking we could host a Hayes & Company Christmas party. Our customers will forgive us for our window display designs if we have a sale and yummy little appetizers. That is a great idea. If you want your shoppers back, invite them. People love a good party. Would you consider planning it? Oh... well, I do have a lot on my plate right now. Whitney is here for a much-needed vacation. And who would do the window? You could totally do it. You pick décor all the time for your events, don't you? I bet you have a great eye. Thanks. It would be an interesting challenge. We could host it just before Christmas. Get all of the out of town people coming in for their last-minute Christmas shopping. Christmas parties are some of my favourite events. But that's not very much time. If I don't get people into the store this Christmas... I'm afraid they're not going to be back next Christmas. Gloria, do you really feel that Whitney could help you, really help you? Sure. Sure. Okay. Great. Cheers! Cheers! What are you doing so dressed up? We're only going to Shep's? Oh Grandma, I'm so sorry. I have to get to Hayes & Company. There's no time to waste. We can get an ornament another time, right? Okay. Okay, love you. Love you. Oooh, take one of these. I'm making eggs, you should eat some. No time! Mmmmhmmm. Bye! Bye. First floor is cosmetics, shoes, men's apparel. Second is women's and children. And executive offices are here on the third floor. And what's on the fourth floor? Just overflow from sales, storage, and some studio space. Have a seat. Oh, thanks. As you know, the store was started by my great-grandfather, Gerald Hayes. We've been family run and operated since we opened in 1934. Yes and we can definitely incorporate that history into the design. Or maybe we shouldn't. People associate history with us, not the future. I want a window that is modern and youthful, and completely outside the box. So an outside the box event and store window? Yes. It'll be awesome. Right. Awesome. Hey Brian. Hey Whitney. "Your ornaments were thrown away. "Surely that was a blunder. "If you want them for your Christmas Day. "Find your Christmas Wonder. "It should be a lot of fun, though it seems like a stunt. "For you to find them one-by-one on a Christmas scavenger hunt." Are you kidding me? Whitney, what is going on? I lost the ornaments. You lost what? Shhhh! I lost my grandma's ornaments. I think I accidentally threw them out when I was unpacking. Your ornaments were thrown away. It's not funny! I don't have time for this. I thought I heard voices out here. Well come on in, dinner's almost ready. Brian, are you staying? I... no, that's okay. I'll eat at home. I can't let you hang all those lights for me and not feed you some good dinner. Come on in here, please. Okay. And we have a great dessert. Ok. Apple pie. Whitney, you look tired. Why don't we put off getting the tree? That would be great. Until tomorrow. I-I - I'd love to go with you guys except I'm busy tomorrow. Well, wouldn't that be lovely. All three of us out together for an outing, yeah. Hi mom! Hi dad! How's the cruise? Amazing. But we miss you guys. We're looking forward to seeing you for Christmas. What is that? It's a video chat, Grandma. You know you could do this on your phone too. Oh, without putting my face on, oh... Hey Frances, you look lovely. I'm gonna let you two chat. Thank you for dinner, Frances. Uh-huh. I'm gonna walk him out. Yeah, you're fine. You got this. I'll talk to you in a second! Mom, we can't see you. Oh. Where'd you go? Here I am. Ah, there we go. Hello. Hello. What? What am I gonna do about these missing ornaments? Come on. It's gotta be Frances, right. She's trying to teach you a little lesson, after losing them. You really think this is the dirty work of Francis Kennison? No, it's not her style. And besides how would she even know that I lost them. When she got home is when I figured it out. Mmm, yeah, I guess that's true. And anyway what if it's not her? I can't tell her what I did. She'd be so hurt. I lost them one day after she entrusted me with them. You did. Okay, take it easy. Could it be the garbage man? Joe? Joe's a blue collar, down to earth guy. I don't- I don't see him writing riddles on his spare time? "You're ornaments were thrown away surely that was a blunder. "If you want them for your Christmas Day, "find your Christmas wonder. "It should be a lot of fun though it seems like a stunt, "for you to find them one-by-one on a Christmas scavenger hunt." I mean, what am I supposed to do with this? "You're likely plum tired, sure you don't have the knack. "To figure out riddles, but give this one a crack." More riddles? And there's no useful information here. I mean, how am I supposed to find these ornaments? Take a breath. Your carelessness could ruin Christmas. But I will help you. Thank you. Okay, I should probably get back in there and talk to my parents. Unless my grandmother has accidentally hung up on them already. Probably. Thanks Brian. Whitney. Yeah. Right. Hello. Whitney, come to the corner of 9th and Spruce and bring your scavenger hunt letter. Brian, I have to get to Hayes & Co- Are we gonna see a show at 10:00am? Can I see this? "You're likely plum tired." The sugarplum fairy. "Sure you don't have the knack. "To figure out riddles but give this one a crack." The Nutcracker! Brian, you're a genius! How did you figure this out? I just thought about the poem. I saw this and kinda just stopped. I dunno. So smart. I have a good feeling about this. So what, we search the whole place? Maybe it's under one of these seats? That's crazy. We can't look under every seat, we'll be hear all day. Maybe it's in the prop room. Ugh. Okay, we can't go searching around in the prop room. I mean, I'm surprised we even got in here in the first place. I guess we come back for the show. I mean, I took on this job thinking I was doing a good thing. Or maybe you were worried that you'd be bored outside of New York City. And now the scavenger hunt is gonna make it impossible for me to plan the party and we haven't even found one ornament yet. Oh, look at her. So beautiful. You know, I was in the show once. Really? Soldier Number Four. Grant Elementary. I was eight. I was understudy to the mouse king. But Larry Kowalski never got sick. Awwww. Well, soldier number four is a pivotal role. Larry had nothing on you. That was wonderful! I wish we had some flowers to give you. Actually, I might have something for you. Are you Whitney? Yes. Thank you! Oh! Do you mind if I ask who gave this to you? Oh... She could've just said no. Open it. Oh! Of course! It's our first ornament. Read the letter. Oh. Right, here. Okay. "Time to get in from the cold, wouldn't you agree? "Put on a very nice dress, for a spot of tea." What? No way. Come on! I can't call and she won't suspect you. Please. All right. Hi Frances. I have to get a gift for... for my aunt. Who- who- who likes tea and Whitney said that when she was a kid, you brought her to a teahouse. Rosette's. Yeah. Alright thank you very much Frances, bye. Great. Oh, sorry. One sec. Ugh, it's Gloria. I can't deal with that right now, I'll call her back. You know, if you were going to lose your grandmother's prized ornaments, you probably shouldn't have taken on a last-minute job at the same time. It's more of a favour, than a job. Well, it's a favour with a big, looming public deadline. But you know what, it's gonna be fine. I can juggle a million things at once. I'm an event planner. Come on, we gotta go get changed. I think I'm gonna crush this thing. That's why you have to hold it like this. Glad you're having fun. I really am. Okay, I have to try one of these. Mmmm, reminds me just of Christmas. Oh, we didn't order anything else. Oh, thanks. Oh, I remember getting this one. What that was from the local artist, right? Mmhmm. I got it at a Christmas fair in Chicago when I was 12. I was obsessed with glass-blowing for a year. Wait. How did you know that? What are you... you're implying that I'm behind all of this? Whitney, if I planned a scavenger hunt, and that's a big if, it certainly would not be here. Hmmm. We've only found two, at this rate I'll be lucky if I find them all by next Christmas. Read the letter. Hopefully you got a ornament out of a diner one year. We can go there next, I'm starving. "Remember your youth when nothing was better, "then making a wish and sending Santa a letter." So what, I have to send Santa a letter now? How would I even go about doing that? I have no idea. Don't laugh. You're not the one who lost her beloved grandmother's precious Christmas ornaments. You would find this funny. You're right. At least you clean up nice. Oooh! Hey you. Hi. Sweetie. Did you get a lot accomplished today? Uhhh... yeah you could say that. Great. 'Cause you know what, tomorrow, we must go get that tree. 'Cause did you know that it's less than three weeks until Christmas. Yeah, less than three weeks. Okay. Okay, darling. Alright, see you later. See you later. "Dear Santa, I haven't written to you in about 20 years." Like Santa cares. "Dear Santa, do you know who took my ornaments?" Ugh, sound like a crazy person. "Dear Santa, I think I'm on the naughty list." Ugh, what else is new. "Dear Santa, please help me make things right "and find Grandma's ornaments. Love, Whitney." Hm. Nailed it. Hi, this is Whitney. I'm an event planner out of New York, but I'm hosting a very last minute event here in Chicago and I'm gonna need rentals. Linens, glassware, oh- You know what I need to call you back. Ah, good morning. Mornin'. Do you have anything for me? Uh... sure. Do you have anything else? Uh... no, that's it. Oh. Maybe Santa like his letter via overnight express. Or maybe he's gone digital and I don't have his e-mail address. I don't know. Hi, it's Whitney Kennison. I need some invitations for a unique event. Next week. I know it's super last minute, but it's not for a private event. It's for a public one. So if you give me what I need, you could put your company logo on the back of the invitations. Just think of the exposure. Okay great. Could you send me some mockups as soon as possible? Fantastic, thanks. Hi, can I help... Whitney Kennison. Hi. Mr. Shepard. Oh please, call me Shep. Where's Frances? You two buying your annual Christmas ornament, again? You seem to remember me well and if I recall correctly you've always been very fond of my grandmother. Who doesn't like Frances? Do you have a penchant for riddles? Ehh... pardon? Do you have some kind of insider information at the post office? No. It is you. You've been sending me notes on that stationary. Dear, I've sold dozens of boxes of this stationary, the last month. Did you perhaps want to buy your yearly ornament? Uh... Not right now. I'll come back. Great to see you. So I contacted a print shop to order invitations to be sent to Hayes & Company account holders. Sounds old fashioned and expensive. Shouldn't it be an e-mail? E-mails get lost in spam folders. Hayes & Company, and this event are special. We want to... set the tone. Okay, then. Oh, and I'm thinking that we'll include in-store coupons to further entice people. Now, we just need the window to feel special too. Yeah. Oh, don't worry, I know, we are not gonna re-use these ladies. I want the space to feel modern and vibrant. What are we gonna replace them with? I ordered new ones. Oh, good. I want this to be unique and spectacular. Keep it up Whitney. Thank you. Uh-huh. Well, do you ladies know what I should be doing? Hi Grandma! Whitney, I have our whole evening planned. Tree shopping and then dinner out. Tree shopping? Today? Yes, today. We've waited long enough. Okay. Sounds good. Oh... uh, Grandma, I gotta go. I'm looking for a letter to Santa. Please tell me who sent you. Okay, fine. Here you go. Ah! Thanks. Oh! Oh. This ornament's from when I was five. The Christmas before I apparently woke up early and unwrapped everyone's presents by myself. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! "Lucky are those with roofs over their heads, "so help those in need by serving up bread." Whitney! This might sound like a weird question, but is there a shelter or a soup kitchen anywhere near your neighbourhood. Uh yeah, yeah there's a uh... the community Centre on Elm Street runs the soup kitchen. Alright, well worth a shot. Okay, thanks Brian. Hello. Are you here to volunteer with us? Yeah, I am. Fantastic. Follow me, please. Thanks. Yeah, so we usually start our volunteers here in the kitchen. Brian? Oh, you two know each other. -Yeah. -Yeah. Well, this is great. You can show her the ropes. Alright. -Thanks. -Thank you. What are you doing here? My family used to volunteer here at Christmas and uh once you mentioned it I realized it's been too long. You are kind of a good guy, aren't you? Yeah, and we can go pick up Frances and bring her to the tree lot afterwards. Yeah, I don't think she's going to wait one more single second. Yeah, let's not worry about that now, there's a big line. You want to follow me? You'll need this and we're good. Ok. Can you serve the mashed potatoes and the bread? Yeah, of course. Hi. There you go. Ah! Ah! Ahhh! This scavenger hunt is gonna be the death of you. You okay? Yeah. Oh, one sec. Gloria. I came looking for you in the window and you'd left. Uh yeah, sorry I had a couple of things I needed to take care of. It's about one of the vendors. Does it need to happen right away? I need to see you right away. Okay. I'll be there, as soon as I can. All right. Something's going on at Hayes & Company, and I need to go right away. And I can't reach the ornament and- Show off. Thank you. This is only the fourth one we've found and I cannot put off tree shopping with Grandma another day. And now I have to go to the store all of a sudden and Christmas is two weeks away, I don't- Listen, whatever new riddle is in here, we'll figure that out later. Let's just go to the store and go we'll go pick up Frances. Okay. Thank you. Oh, I don't think I'll be able to. I'm so glad you're here then. -Great. -But I will come. As moral support. Moral support's, hey, I'll take it. Yeah, thank you. Whitney! You brought a friend. Uh... yeah. This is um... this is Brian. Just a friend. Yeah. Very serendipitous. You didn't even know there was heavy lifting today. Heavy lifting? Yeah, come with me. Augh! These weren't supposed to come until next week. They don't even have eyes, but you feel like they're staring into your soul. They delivery guys just showed up and left 'em. The head of maintenance was gonna put them in your window, but I wasn't quite sure- Oh no, no, no, no! I'm not ready for them to be in there yet. I need to envision the space. So look where can we stash them in the meantime. Uh... they can go in the forth floor in the studio. Okay. Okay, come with me. You killed her! Already. I'm coming. She's so cold, you broke her arm off. I'm coming. Oh jeez. Wait for me. Slow down. So what do you plan to do with these things. Well, they're a part of the design for the window. They're y'know, very modern, youthful, dramatic. Huh! Well, it's a little cluttered but this could work. Hold on a minute. This is the dimension of the window. It's perfect. Huh. What? What's up? Nothing. It's just that... that th-this place it- it's a goldmine of history. Brian, this isn't your job. It's mine. I- I'm just saying. I'm sorry, I'm just a little bit stressed out. Gloria thinks it's a liability that the store is so old, so she definitely doesn't want me to play any of this stuff up. And I still haven't come up with an idea for the window that's gonna... dazzle. You dazzle. Uh... right. We should finish up. Frances is... she's waiting for us. Yeah. Oh! Oh, I love a blue spruce! Really? I prefer a Douglas fir. Ha. Ha. Ha. I had no idea you had such a goofy sense of humour. Yeah, there's a lot you don't know about me. Frances! Yeah. How about this one? "It's been many years, so you may feel like a rookie. "But isn't it time to make a fresh Christmas cookie." Grandma. Yeah. What are you doing tomorrow? Why? Do you remember when we used to pass out Christmas cookies to all the neighbours? Oh yes, I do. We should do that again. Yes! That's a lovely idea, Whitney! Let's do it! Let's do it! Alright! What? How about this one? It's perfect! What a lovely evening! We found our tree. We had a great dinner out. Oh Brian, here thank you! Put it right over there in the corner please. Right in the corner. Ok. Yeah. Oh Whitney, can you put the leftovers in the refrigerator, thank you. Sure thing, Grandma. Oh it's perfect, Brian! And there's the tree stand, right there. Oh and Whitney could you bring the ornaments for the tree? Do what now? The ornaments. We're gonna decorate the tree. Uh... Frances... how old is this tree stand? Well, it belonged to my grandmother actually. What is this thing? It's cast iron, it weighs a tonne. Uh-huh. I don't think this thing's tightening properly. Oh. Yeah, I wouldn't put your ornaments on. 'Cause what if the tree falls over and then your whole collection... gone. It worked just fine 'till now. W-well why don't you let me build you a new one and it'd be something that's equally special. Are you sure you want to do that, Brian? Nothing would make me happier. That is so nice. Thank you, Brian. Unfortunately, I guess that means we can't really trim the tree tonight. Oh. Bummer. Well, since I can't trim the tree tonight. I think I'm going to take a nice long, hot bath. Alright well you better get plenty of rest tonight because we have to bake a lot of cookies tomorrow. I can't wait! Mwah! I love you. Love you. Thank you Brian. Good night. That was brilliant. I don't even know what you mean, I just had a sudden desire to uh... build a tree stand. Well, if there's anything I can do to help you. If you're serious, I could use a hand right now. Oh! Ok. So what are we doing, here? Uh... I'll show you. See this work bench. Uh-huh. I have to be able to get to it if I'm going to build the tree stand. Oh. Well, in that case, let me help you. Okay. Do you always need to clear this much stuff, just to get to that thing? No, because I've never used it before. Really? It was my dad's. He showed me how to build a birdhouse on this, when I was eight. Your dad passed away last year, didn't he? I was really sorry to hear that. Yeah, and I could've taken some smaller, more practical things, but I wanted this. And once I got it into the garage, I just didn't really know what to do with it. But today seems like a good day to clean it off. Should probably get this out for Joe. Yeah. So, how well do you know Joe the garbage man. I mean, are you sure he's not behind all this? This whole thing is making you paranoid. No... I mean, maybe. I did verbally accost a mail carrier and accuse Shep down at the Christmas store. Y'know it's been challenging enough finding the ornaments. I don't think you have the time to find out who's hiding them. Honestly, at this point I just want our ornaments back. Plus, I haven't had this much fun during Christmas, since I was a kid. So, from now on I'm just gonna try and enjoy it. That's uh... that's good for you. I'm having fun too. I'm not sure that it's just because of the scavenger hunt. Uh... it seems like you've got this under control so... I will leave you to it. Right. Ok. Bye. Good night, Whitney. Good night. Yes, I need a beverage cart service for an event. Um, hot chocolate, eggnog, and mulled wine. Great, can you send me over the information right away. Perfect, thanks. Alright, party is coming along. Now, I just need to figure out this window. Whitney! Come on, it's time to bake! Do you remember the first year we did this, Grandma, when we ran out of cookies. Well, that's not how it happened. What do you mean? You were five and you were so worried about us not saving enough cookies for ourselves, that at every house you'd give them a bag of cookies and then you'd put a bag in your pocket. No, I did not. Yes, you did. Did I? Yes. Oh my... What uh... what inspired you to want to make cookies again for the neighbours? I don't know. I guess being back here for Christmas just reminded me of all the memories we've made. Well then, let's deliver some cookies, shall we? Yes, let's. Only this time I want to see where your hands are. Oh! Grandma. You're gonna get it. I meant it. You're going to get it. You better watch out. You better watch out! You better watch out!! Oh. No, no, no, no. Hey! Hi Brian! Woah, don't hurt us. Just take the cookies. It's a wood carving knife. I'm trying to carve a design into Frances' new tree stand. Oh. Yeah, well keep your expectations low because I am an architect and not a woodcarver. Now Brian, you did not have to go to all this trouble. Oh, I don't mind. As long as you don't mind waiting to decorate the tree. Could take like two, three more days. That's very thoughtful Brian. Thanks. Well, we don't want to keep you. We'll let you get back to work. But look what we have for you. Give you some energy while you're doing it. All-right! Thank you! -See you later. -See ya. Okay. Bye. See ya. Thank you. Oh Whitney! You're back already. What? Did you already get an ornament? No! Grandma, I would never do that. That's our tradition. Mr. Shepard you must have me confused with someone else. But I thought we talked about- Actually, we came to bring you cookies. Maybe you should have one. Maybe right now. Whitney, look at this. It's a grandmother, swingin' a little girl around. Which I certainly could not do now. No, probably not. It says "Grandma". Aw... it's perfect. Ooooooohhh! Want me to wrap it up? Yes. Please. Oh yes. Oh, this one. Cute. So cute. Mmmhmmm. Hi Bob! Merry Christmas! Here's some cookies for ya! Hi. Thank you. Whitney, I'm glad you and Francis are finally getting some time together. Finally. Yep uh-huh. Cricket, have you met Whitney? Whitney, this is our Cricket. Hi Cricket. Nice to meet you. Have a good day, enjoy the cookies. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. Nice to see you. Nice to so see you. Grandma... Yeah. Have you been complaining to everyone that I've been too busy. Complaining no, bragging because I'm so happy to have you with me for Christmas. Look there's the Wagner family. Hi Wagner family! Hi! Hi! Not that hat. You know what? Life is too short for boring clothes, here. Hi, I'm Whitney. Whitney, hi. I'm Kelly, it is so nice to- Finally meet me. Yep. Yeah. This might sound odd, but I have something for you. Not as odd as you'd think. Great. Ok. Here you go. Thank you. Hey! What's going on? Ugh, I dunno. You having some design trouble? Yeah, and there's only a week left until the party. I mean, what do you do when you have a mental block. Are you ever designing a house and just have no idea what to do? Yes, it happens all the time. Sometimes I just work on another project or I'll just take a break and clear my head. What's next on the hunt? Oh right. Well, "don't be a Scrooge this Christmas season. "This story is a classic for a very good reason." Scrooge? "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens? So we have to buy a book then? There's a book store on Main. Great. I'll get my stuff. All right. Oh, excuse me! Do you have another copy of "A Christmas Carol"? Is there something wrong with that one? Well, I just... I need a special copy. Like a special copy- Ahem... Uh yeah! Never mind, thanks. Thank you. You're gonna get a reputation as a weirdo around here. What? A special copy. Well, someone is getting dressed up. Has anyone ever told you, you're too skinny? Hmmm. Hey Brian, it's me. I just um... I just found a lot of really cool historical stuff in the Hayes & Company storage room and... I thought of you. Anyway um... talk to you later. Okay, bye. ...that is a Christmas delight! Frances! I can't decide whether to paint or stain the tree stand. Do you have a preference? Please. Please. Do not tell Whitney. It was just for a reminder to try to get her to slow down and- and to- to pay attention to what matters most. I'm not gonna lie to Whitney. No, no, no. I just want you to keep on helping her, the way you've been helping her. I do think that you two have been enjoying each other's company a great deal. Frances! Yes. Ah, you Kennison women... you're wearing me out. Hi! Uh do you have a copy of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" and did anyone happen to leave there maybe a present for someone named Whitney at your store? No, no. I understand you guys don't offer gift wrapping. I'm asking... you know what, never mind. Thanks. Okay. Hi! Do you have Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" in stock? Completely sold out. Okay, got it. Oh no, I hadn't thought about checking my public library. That's great, thank you so much. Wow Whitney! Well, someone smart reminded me that I should look at the past events I've planned as inspiration for the window. Well, I did this wedding in New York last year and it was incredibly a sleek and modern aesthetic. Lots of metal and glass. Mhmmm. So I was thinking, maybe we could do a cross between a winter wonderland and a really posh event out front, and just carry the party into the store. It's elegant! It's modern! This is what's gonna make people stop and look! I am so excited. Yay! Aw. Are you, uh, taking a date to the party? A date? Yeah. Perhaps that really cute guy who was helping you with the mannequins. Oh Brian! Oh no, no, no. We're just friends. Sure whatever you say. Hello! Hello Frances! Hi Grandma! Mwah! Darling. I asked my grandma to come take a look at the window. What do you think? Ah... well... it's uh, very... stark. I was just telling Whitney that I thought it was very elegant and modern. Oh yes! Those things too. Well, we're not done yet. And wow! Those mannequins are- Striking huh! I do feel as if I've been struck. I don't think my grandma likes it very much. No, no, I didn't mean to imply that. Whitney you always do wonderful work. Do you... do you have an outfit for the unveiling? No I- I think we should go shopping. Well now- My treat. Ok. Woah! Alright darling. Have fun! Oh, Gloria. Thank you. Psst. Psst. Did you find what you're looking for? I thought you were gonna wait in the car. I got cold. Besides don't you need my library card to get a book. Yes, I do. Uh, give me one sec. Okay. Would you do me a favour and check that out for me please? Sure. But aren't you coming? Uh... yes. I just need to do one quick thing. One more. One quick thing. I'll be right there. Ok. We got this because of the year we were snowed in at Christmas. "Where do you go on a cold winter night, "for a sweet treat that's a Christmas delight." Hmmm. Well, I found something new to read at the library, but I have no idea what it means. Whitney! Is that Brian? He can't get his cooking lesson outside. Coming Grandma! Show me after. Ok. Grandma, you wouldn't happen to have any marshmallows we could roast over the fire, do you? Marshmallows? I just made you homemade eggnog. You want more sugar? Oh no, no, no, no! Ha, I was just remembering that one Christmas we roasted marshmallows out back. We did, didn't we. Oh, we've had so many lovely Christmas memories throughout the years. Well, let's make some more memories. Brian! I know that you don't have the Christmas tree stand ready yet. But I think that Christmas stand would make it for one more Christmas. Let's decorate the tree, right now! Oh, you know what, Grandma? I was just about to say I am feeling so, so tired right now. All of a sudden. Yeah, gosh. Must be all the rum in the egg nog. I am just gonna hit the hay I think. Ummm, we can decorate the tree tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow. Okay, good night guys! Good night. You are diabolical. Hi Gloria it's Whitney. I know you're gonna come see the window today, but a couple of things have been back ordered and I'm not really able to move forward at the moment. So I'm gonna go for the day. But I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay, thanks. Frances! Brian? Oh! Oh! Oh! Brian, the Christmas stand is wonderful. Now we can finally decorate the tree. Look at it. I love it. But first Whitney has to finish finding all the ornaments, doesn't she? I am so glad you stopped by. Actually, it's perfect timing. Because I have a really big favour, uh-huh, to ask of you. It's for you and Whitney. Frances no, no way. There's no way that I can hang all these Christmas tree lights. Not at my age. At least not in a timely manner. This is gonna help my Whitney have a beautiful, cherished Christmas vision, a memory. Alright. Brian. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hey Brian, meet me out back in five minutes. Wow! It's so beautiful. Look. Another ornament. Oh! This has always been one of my favourites. I mean what is more Christmas-y than a perfect white dove, right? Yeah. "At Christmas there are many beautiful sights, "but none more special than all the twinkling lights." So... we should go see the Christmas lights in town? Well, one thing at a time. A toast to the scavenger hunt. I mean roast. Brian? Uh-huh. Do you think I'm making a mistake with the store? I never said that. No, no I know you didn't say that. I just mean, what you said about the history at Hayes & Company. Yeah, Whitney as you reminded me it's not my job to worry about it, it's yours. And you have a client, the client has plans for the store. But if it was your decision? I've just been so focused on creating a spectacle, I haven't stopped to think if it's the right thing to do. But Hayes & Company shouldn't look like every other store in this city. I mean, it's an institution! Where's this coming from all of a sudden? This scavenger hunt has forced me to revisit past Christmases. And think about what's really important to people at this time of year. Well, should be important all year long, really. Y'know? Yeah. And if I'd never found my grandma's ornaments- Your ornaments now. My ornaments. It would've been such a shame. What if I'm stealing Hayes & Company's ornaments, so to speak? Wow! You really are a big softie after all, aren't you? Will you come with me for a second? I have a present that I want to give you. Sure. Okay. I can take your blanket. Oh, thanks. Welcome to the illustrious headquarters of Montgomery Residential Architects. Architects? I'm confident that eventually there'll be others. It's nice! So... When you lost Frances' ornaments I thought that you should probably have somewhere safer to store them than an old cardboard box. I got this at a second-hand store. And I lined the interior with padding and felt. Ah! "Whitney, you're preserving something with a history. "So why not store them in something with its own history. "Merry Christmas, Brian." Brian, this is so, so thoughtful. Do you like it? It's amazing. You! You're behind the scavenger hunt! No! No, no, no, no, I'm not. But I- I did find out who was a while ago and I didn't tell you. But she begged me not to and if I'd stopped helping you then you would know and I didn't want to ruin the whole thing. She? Grandma. Of course. She's a very determined lady. Where are you going? Why are you mad at me? I didn't realize that the only reason you've been helping me was because Grandma Frances wanted you to. That's not why. And if anybody had a reason to question motives, it's me. Would you have had any time to hang out with me if it wasn't for the scavenger hunt? That's not fair. Whitney, we had something and on that last visit... I'm not imagining it. But you have done everything that you can to deny it and everything that you can to push me away. You know what Brian? I am not the cellphone or Grandma's Christmas sites. I'm not some little project of hers, that you can help with. Okay? You've been lying to me! I kept secrets for you too. I was just trying to help. Hey, Grandma! Would you want to maybe come on a walk? Go look at the Christmas lights in the neighbourhood? What a lovely idea. Ha! What made you think of that? You did. Was it Brian who gave me up? Well, it could have been anyone in town, really. Everybody loves you and Shirley would have gone to extravagant lengths to help you make a point. But I had a feeling you had something to do with it, one way or another. Mmmmm. And I don't even know that many people in town. Plus all the memories were my memories. Well, our memories. And I went along with it because I knew it was important to you. Well, I thought that a scavenger hunt would be so much fun. I had fun. I did too. But how did you know I lost the ornaments in the first place? I ran into Joe, on my speed walk coming home that day. I knew that garbage man had something to do with it. He had 'em, I told him to hold them until I could- Run me around town for a couple weeks. I'm sorry I lied to you. Are you angry? No, no not at you. I'm mad at myself for losing the ornaments in the first place and also for taking you and Christmas and other things for granted. What other things? What if I'm overlooking the beauty and history of Hayes & Company with my window design? I think sometimes I don't see a good thing, even when it's right in front of me. You know what, Whitney. I think that sometimes things have a tendency to end up okay in the end. -I love you. -I love you. Hey, you know what, Grandma? What? We should document this moment, right now? Uh-oh. Mmmhmm. You are talking about one of those selfie things. Oh yeah. And Grandma. Yeah. -One more thing. -What? If I can run around town on this scavenger hunt and find those ornaments, you can learn to use that fancy new phone of yours someday. Oh boy. Okay, smile. Hey, that's not bad. Hey, maybe I can learn. Mhmmm. Grandma. What? The next ornament, where is it? Well I was gonna put it in somebody's mailbox and have a note sticking out. But you didn't give me a chance. So you know what I'm relieved this whole thing is over. 'Cause I'm exhausted. And I'm running out of ideas. I don't blame you. Hey! You're up! Finally we can decorate the tree! Yay! Soon, I promise. But I have to get to Hayes & Company. I'm sorry, I just gotta get that window finished, once and for all. Ohhhh. Hey Grandma. Yeah. Can you be honest with me? How much of the scavenger hunt was about you pushing Brian and I together again? Whitney, I may have been a matchmaker in the past but... this scavenger hunt was designed to help you slow down. And to help you pay attention to what matters most. 'Cause darling, someday you're going to be my age and you can't share your memories with your job. That's true. And might I remind you that you are the one that sought Brian's help. Huh? Alright, I'll see you. Okay, have a good day! You too. Hey! Yeah Whitney, come in. I went to take a peek at the window and it was locked. Oh! That's actually what I came to talk to you about. Uh, I'm making some last minute changes and I'd really love it if you would let me finish up, before you take a look. Uhhh... I'm seeing something a little bit different. Trust me, it's going to be great. Well, bu... We're gonna just take it all out. All of it. That one, get the flowers too. That's gotta go, all of it. Thanks. Hi, thanks for calling me back. I need a seamstress who can replicate vintage clothing, quickly. These cookies are very good. Thanks. That was Whitney. She has to work late. Well, that gives me some time. Gives me some time to apologize. I never thought that a scavenger hunt could cause this much trouble. And it was very short-sighted of me. I'm not innocent in this. I liked that Whitney wanted my help. Let me spend time with her, without uh... without having to let her know how I felt. I lied to her though. Oh no, I don't see it that way and when she has a moment to think about it, she won't either. I hope so. I know so. It was just that she... she was surprised... and she was embarrassed. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas. ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas. ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. ♪ ♪ With tidings we bring to you and your kin, ♪ ♪ we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas, ♪ ♪ we wish you a Merry Christmas, ♪ ♪ we wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a Happy New Year.

Should I show you? Sure. Ok. After you. Are those the old mannequins? I know it's not what we discussed but- It's exquisite. Really? Yeah. I'm so glad you love it. It depicts Hayes & Company through the years. The world changed, the store changed, but the one constant has been the place it holds in the hearts and lives of its customers. That's why people shop here. They're a part of the community that your grandfather created. Whitney, your interpretation of Hayes & Company is so fresh and fashionable. Aw... Mrs. Kennison. Thank you so much for introducing me to Whitney. She is my Christmas angel. I will see you two inside. Because we have to host a big party! So? What do you think? Whitney, it's a work of art. Thanks Grandma. I realized that Hayes & Company didn't need a new modern design because it's a lot like our ornaments. Old and full of character. I'm so sorry that this job took me away from our Christmas. But I just want you to know that I did it because of you. This store is special to me because of the memories that you and I have made here together. Oh, honey. Well, you know what, then lets go inside and celebrate. Y'know I think I've done enough, here. You and I have a Christmas tree to decorate. But before we go, I think that your parents should see this. Oh! How? A ha! Video chat! Hi! Mom, you video chatted us? Well, I want you to see her wonderful, Whitney's wonderful, beautiful creation here. Ready! Yeah show it to us, please. Alright, I'm trying. No Grandma, you know you can just reverse the camera. Oh reverse, I thought I finally understood this technological stuff here. But look! You did that kiddo? Fabulous! That is beautiful. Thanks you guys. It's great, mwah. I hope that uh... you will reconsider taking these beautiful decorations home with you. I really don't want to do that, Grandma. They belong here. Ok. And I think I do too. What? Are you telling me that you think you might stay in Chicago? I think it might be time for me to finally settle down. Maybe start my own company, make my own hours... Make time for things other than work. Well, that is wonderful. Wonderful. I am gonna go and get that step-ladder. You hang this one, the grandmother one on. And we are going to finish this tree. Oh! Hello. Hi. Hi I.... I didn't know if you... Yeah, yeah no, I do, I do... I'm sorry that I ran out. Yeah, I'm sorry. Can we maybe go talk about things? I think we're going to have a lot of time to talk about things because I just got a text that says you're staying in town. I just told her. Wait, she knows how to text? Apparently. I guess she's finally figured it out. I guess she's not the only one, is she? I'm really happy that you're staying in town.
