On this day, wishing you happiness In high school, there was this boy who liked me He wrote me letters everyday and put gifts in my locker One day, he fell off the roof I still wonder if it was a suicide attempt or an accident Anyway, he survived When he woke up at the hospital, they asked his name and number, to see if he was conscious the first words out of his mouth were my name and my number Is that the most memorable event for you? What happened to him? I graduated while he was still in the hospital I don't know after that Are you going to the bath house? We've been to the temple before We want to try the sea water bath - What? - Don't be late See you here in an hour Enjoy yourself By the flower bed, Iooking at the flowers where did the mysterious light come from Now is the time to wash away everything that is tainted in our hearts in this clear stream A time for quiet reflection Mt. Sorak, we must leave you when the new day breaks - How is it over there? - It's safe - Safe? You're wet to your butt - It's OK Come on in It's nice and cool Where are you headed? - Looking for a place to stay? - Yes - Do you know any? - Sure Take this road straight and turn into the first alley Are you on patrol?

You can tell me the truth You don't trust anyone I don't trust anyone? To me, you always seem... The things you say, as if worried about me, disgust me You act like you are above it all, but I think you are so immature You know nothing about me, so why act as if you do? Maybe I don't want to know about you You think you're so special but you're no different Everything about you is so cliche That's enough, Misun Right, let's stop this "Cliche", do you even know what it means? How can you say that? Eunkyoung can know everything, but I can't? We're supposed to be friends? - Forget it - What's with you today, Misun? Let her live her own life the way she wants Enough, enough There's something fake about all that mystery That's the feeling I get Can't you see what you can and cannot have in life? Unfortunately, I can I try for what I can get and give up on the rest Sometimes it hurts so much It may sound corny, but I've been making sacrifices for my dream You mean your relationship with the married man? And you broke up with him, right? I wonder why we hang out together We're so different, you know Where is the owner going in such a hurry? There was an accident He's also a chief in the local rescue team How come you didn't go? My turf is in the village Someone just fell off the cliff There was a scream, but no one saw anything It could just be a prank call You didn't go cause you're drunk That's it Bottoms up Why do you keep turning the glass? Silly, huh? No, it's interesting Shall we go some place else? Where? To your place? My house is far from here How often do you see your wife? Everyday I'm going to check out on Misun You'll be here for a while, right? You are? - Will you be all right? - Sure I'll be back soon Hurry up, then Be careful Come on, get a grip This way, a little more Come on, Jisook On your feet Let's go Where are you going? We can rest at the guard post for a while You can't go back like this I lost my hair band Let's get going No, It's over there Here, here Let's go now Where's Eunkyoung? You can see her passing... from the guard post Let's get inside Come on, a little more Here we go Eunkyoung might misunderstand Well, she was drunk too Don't worry, and let's go in What time is it? Four o'clock We have to leave early I know Stop worrying and rest You know we're so grateful Jisook, I'm sorry Really sorry for last night I was too harsh on you What, did something happen yesterday? I don't know Let's hurry, we're going to be late Isn't the weather great? Hello Don't worry I'll look for it It was a gift from my uncle What's the brand? - Nikon - Nikon? Yes, not even a month old He'll find it What am I going to do? I'll find it Don't worry What's wrong with me... I'll give you the school telephone number - Would you call me there? - Yes, I will That cop looks so much like a teacher I know Is that so? I thought it was him at first How could they look so much alike? Anything's possible He seemed like a real nice man, huh? Yeah He seemed nice Want some? Just a little Let's wait taking a long view I'm going to say I'll be spending the night with you, OK? It doesn't matter Must you go and see him? I'll be back the day after So, you've kept in touch with that cop? He called me first, And sometimes I called him, too Honestly, I'm a little worried Are your really going by yourself? Of course Spending a night? In Kangwon Province? I can't make it back in a day Long time no see What is this? How could you make me wait this long? I'm sorry What was I to do here, not knowing a soul? I'm sorry I couldn't find you, so I've been to the station I'm just coming back Do you know how nervous I was? We were supposed to meet here, where else would I be? I'm sorry I apologize You didn't come all this way to be angry with me I'll buy some sashimi Let's go to Sokcho and have some Wouldn't you like that? Why aren't you in your uniform today? It's my day off Not mad any more, right? - Sea squirt, on the house - Thank you It looks delicious Here what, worried about garlic breath? Help yourself Do you often eat sashimi in Seoul? It's very expensive in Seoul You too, help yourself Isn't it nice here? It is, I like the smell of the ocean Isn't this strange? I never thought we'd be meeting here like this You look better in plain clothes Really? You think so? You look carefree, maybe even younger Not many people look good in pink I think I'm going to quit my job What would you do, then? I don't know yet Itjust occurred to me that I'm not cut out to be a cop What do you think? I think you're a good cop Come on So she jumped off the cliff? That's what the man said, but who knows what happened? Why? Why would she jump off the cliff? Beats me I'm sure that he'll be convicted Anyway, it's strange that you ran into them on the mountain She had beautiful eyes How did he get caught? There was a call from a witness He gave the police the man's name That's all I know It was a hard trip The bus was filled with scary looking men Are you scared of people? It's not that I'm scared of people It's that those people were scary looking Maybe because it was my first trip alone So, on your first trip alone, you came to meet me Right? I've met you before That's what I'm saying, you met me on your first trip alone What I'm saying is that I met you before, and you're drunk now Jisook, can I ask you something? What kind of feeling do you think I have for you? What? Mister I am very tired Come here I like it here Why? Cause I'm drunk? Am I repulsive? Don't be that way Let's just go to sleep Jisook What's wrong? Get off me I'm sorry I know I came all this way... Jisook, I'll snap out of it I'll wash up, cold water will help We can talk afterwards I'm going to wash up How's your coffee? - It is OK? - It's bitter Put in some sugar I don't take... sugar in my coffee You didn't sleep at all last night, did you?

Yes, it's been a while That's good Good? You seemed to be under a lot of stress lately Remember when you got drunk and out of control? I never wanted to see you again, you know that? That's enough It's in the past So, how old was she? That's exactly what you'd say - How old was she? - Twenty two Quite young Young, yes But she was the most mature woman I had ever met And certainly most lovable, that's for sure It might sound stupid, but I was in love for the first time I wanted to take care of her for life We even cried listening to songs. Silly, huh? You really love her, huh? Yeah, but it's all in the past now I think it's good for both you and your wife Well, I hope it is - This tiny thing is from Japan - It is What are the symptoms? Nothing serious, just something in his eyes I see Shall I recommend something else? Yes Something domestic will do Ah, that's better That feels much better now It is all gone?

Are you blind or what? I am very sorry... Sorry So, you still see Jaewan often? When I saw him this morning, he hinted that you have a chance this time What bull shit But was he serious?

You do You definitely do Go see Professor Kim, You should know that he has a lot of influence Professor Kim? Are you serious? You must be joking That pig A pig?
