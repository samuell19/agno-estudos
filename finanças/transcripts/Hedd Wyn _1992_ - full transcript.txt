For centuries, the Celtic peoples of Britain honoured their poets by awarding them a chair at the courts of kings and princes. This tradition has survived to the modern-day Eisteddfod where a chair is awarded to the author of the best poem in traditional metre. In 1917, the fourth year of the Great War, the National Eisteddfod was held at Birkenhead. If the poet who competed under the pen-name "Fleur-de-lis" is here... ...he should stand. If "Fleur-de-lis" is here... I say once more, he is to stand. If â€œFleur-de-lis" is here... ...he should stand. The deep tears of my sorrow were once to be heard And the rocks would echo my plaintive pleas; Because I was once the maid of the tempests; I would weep in the wind and the sadness of seas. You'd have heard by now wouldn't you, Ellis? Yes. It's too late now.. Make an effort, Bob! It's easy for you, I've got the hardest job. I'd rather do your work. When I've taught you how. I've something for you! What is it? I'm not telling ... unless I can go! Go where? Give it to me! Magi, put him out of his misery! You've won at the Pwllheli Eisteddfod You must go to be chaired! You hear that, father? Yes, well done. Your mother will be delighted. One more to be dusted. I've enough work with the other two you've won! Get some more milk, Ann! Why do you want to win chairs, Ellis? So we can sit on them! Mam won't let me sit on them! Mam won't let us breathe on them! I'll have to go with him Mam, he'll never find the place by himself I'm not going by myself. Moi will come with me. Mary must go with you, then! She'll keep an eye on you. Can I go with them, Mam? You can't all go. I can't afford it. Only an excuse to avoid work! The author is obviously enchanted by recent romantic poetry. But he can't be accused of plagiarism What's he saying, Moi? That Ellis is one hell of a poet! This poem has the true essence of poetry. We are grateful to R.Williams Parry for that excellent adjudication. Now, we'll proceed with the chairing ceremony. If the winning poet is present... ...will he stand up. Get up, Ellis! The winner of the Chair competition at the Pwllheli Eisteddfod, 1913... ...is Mr Ellis Evans of Ysgwm, Trawsfynydd. Best known by his bardic name, Hedd Wyn. The truth against the world. Is there Peace? Peace! We invite the poet to sit in peace... ...the peace 0f the eisteddfod. I walked along sweet river-banks... To the sound of the shy, nervous wind Around the old mountain's neck The sunshine's white arm was entwined Around the old mountain's neck The sunshine's white arm was entwined Bloody guns! At least they bring money to the area... Money for some, maybe. Not enough to compensate for the noise and mess they make. We might need that firing range soon. It doesn't look too good in the Balkans. What do you know about the Balkans? Nothing. I was only saying... Well, don't bother. Get us another pint. It's Ellis' turn. I'm broke - I'll pay you back. I'm sure. Come Judgement Day! You'll have it back sooner than you think! No one's entered the local poetry competition. So what! The prize is five shillings. Enough for twenty pints of beer! What are you trying to say, Elsyn? I can't compete. I'm adjudicating. But you can. Me! l wouldn't know where to start. You can start here. I'll recite and you write. Must support local culture, mustn't we, Griff? Of course... You're mad, Elsyn! These verses aren't perfect. They bear the mark of a beginner. Take these lines for example... Whether the weather's hot or cold myself in the mirror I behold. But friends, we must encourage new talent... "and give them every support. As only one has competed... ...l propose he's awarded the prize in full. The winner is Morris Davies, Plas Capten. I'm sure we're glad to see this area producing yet another hard. You won't win the National like that, Ellis! What do you mean? You'll have to write better than that to win the Chair. Congratulations! Thank you. And now Miss Lizzie Roberts will sing for us... ...before the adjudication on the shepherds' crooks. Have you started it yet? Yes, but it's not very inspired. I'd like to see it. You will. Will you check my spelling? I'm not as educated as you, remember. God... My legs are shaking so much I doubt I can walk you home! That's all you do, take me home. I wish you didn't have to. Oh, Lizzie. You don't want to marry a pauper. There's plenty of time yet. For you, maybe. What about me? I'm older than you. Don't start that again! Maybe you're taking advantage of me. Don't be silly. We have fun together, don't we? Not innocent fun though... That worries me. Well, stop worrying. Easy for you to say. Come on. Has he been writing all night again? Where on earth have you been? Why, what time is it? What time indeed. It's almost dinner-time! Your father needs your help. Those other two had better be useful when they grow up. No need to keep on, Mary. Wasn't much to do this morning. It was almost dawn when he got in. I took Lizzie Roberts home. I was late getting back. This family will be the death of me. What have you got against her? Nothing, l was only thinking of you. What do you mean? Where would you live if you got married? There's not enough room here. God knows how you'd cope! I only took her home. Anyway... ...if Lizzie wanted to get married... ..she'd have done so by now. Marry her and you'll starve. She's only a maid-servant. Marriage wouldn't suit you. You'll be an old bachelor. Let me be a young one first! I've lost the enchanted land forever The beautiful land... ..embroidered with silver. Anything missing here, Ellis? It doesn't seem to flow. Hang on... This bit goes there. Good thing you noticed. Your poems are like your sheep... ...all over the place! Negligence could cost you the Chair. I've no chance. My Welsh isn't scholarly enough. I'm just another country poet... ..according to you college boys. You're a better poet than most of us. Your lines have passion. Education can't give you that. I shan't win. I'd just like to know where I stand. You could win it! With a little more care... "and less womanising! William... Where do you think that passion comes from? I knew you'd be out here. I'm composing a poem for the National Out here on your own. You'll freeze to death! I'm not on my own! - Arianrhod is here! - Who? The old Welsh name for the moon. A goddess of the Celts. On nights like this... ..Arianrhod writes for me. She fires my imagination... ..and guides my hand. She opens her universe to me. Best leave you two together, then! Damn English! You don't expect a firing range to be quiet, do you? The trout swam away! We used to swim here, us girls, when we were young. I know. We used to watch you, us boys! You wicked lot! If my parents had known, they'd have half killed me! Come on, Lizzie. I'll race you to the water. We can't do that! No one will know! I'll be first! Come on! Almost ready! I've won! Elsyn... What will you wear when you come out? - What? You're going to marry me, aren't you? I want to know. Now! Yes! Finished your piece for the National Eisteddfod yet? Yes. William Morris says I could win. He should know better. What chance does a farmer's son have? Don't you have faith in me? No. None! Will you come with me if I win? Of course. I've never been to Bangor. But don't raise my hopes now... The Kaiser is today's Caesar. If you are on God's side... ..join now to keep Great Britain great and mighty. This is your opportunity, youth of Wales. Lies. Lies! He's preaching the gospel of profanity! He's a disgrace to his calling. Don't be deceived! Don't listen to him! Christ was a soldier for justice. Soldiers of Christ march victorous! You're needed to protect the weak from the strong. To defend the truth from lies. You're needed, young men of Ffestiniog and Meirionnydd. ...to fight for your country... ..and to protect your families. Who will be the first to enlist? Come on, Elsyn! What's the hurry, Griff? The War's only just started. I hope it's over before we marry, Elsyn. Let's go, Lizzie. I was a dragon, when warriors were roused to battle; I was a shield to the weak... When battlefields would redden, And on my breast... The blood of every Armageddon. Are you going to enlist? No! He's needed here. I'm going to join up as soon as I can You're too young. You'll have to wait at least three years. Three years? No war will last that long. That student preacher is coming, Ellis. Mr Morris to you! How are you, William? Fine. Have you heard? Bangor Eisteddfod has been postponed. Until this war is over. What does that mean? No adjudication for a year! I've not told my parents, about us getting married. Would you like to come with me? Plenty Of time, Lizzie. Yes, for some! They're madmen! They must he... ...to fight your battles for you. You're a coward, Ellis! Why? Because I don't want to kill anyone? That's what's wrong. You're afraid of being a man! A uniform makes me a man, does it? It would show you're not afraid! I thought you liked your men naked! Yes, if I can have a real man! What's wrong, Ellis? Come on, tell me. What's wrong? You are. Do you have to keep on? I'm only trying to help. Leave me alone! You're stubborn, Ellis. All girls want to get married. Go and treat her at the fair. I'm going with Moi. There. Go and buy some sweets. Behave yourself. And come home sober! Come on, Moi. I've been looking for you. But I haven't been looking for you. Nothing personal. I just don't like your clothes. We are all so very sad, We are all so very sad; We are all so broken-hearted, Now that the black pig has died. It is time to stop my singing: After such a good upbringing. Take care not to follow Such a very bad example. We are all so very sad, We are all so very sad; We are all so broken-hearted, Now that the black pig is dead. Drink up, Griff - it'll be a while! I'll be home before Christmas. Why does anger... "oh, Myfanwy. Fill your eyes with tears? Your gentle cheeks now... "oh, Myfanwy. Never blush when we meet. Where is the smile that once did kindle... This faithful, foolish love of mine? Where is that voice... ..so full of sweetness? What a state to be in! Mam would be furious... What happened? She's left me... ...for some bloody soldier! A Soldier! What have you done? So, fighting makes you feel better? Did you hit him? You must've done something... I'm surprised, you of all people! If you can't settle a quarrel with words, who can? I said there wasn't time for another pint! We drank it, didn't we? So there was time! Enjoy the moving pictures, girls? Yes, but you two were funnier! I know you - Ellis Evans, the poet. I've seen you at eisteddfodau. Is your friend a poet? He's won - once or twice. We're surrounded by poets! It's difficult to know who's who. You all hide behind pen-names. What name do you hide behind? Jini Owen! And your friend? She's Jini Owen. I'm Gwen. Gwen Williams. We're getting off soon. Off where? Llan! Where in Llan? You're a better barrister than bard! Seven, Pant Llwyd, if you must know. We're going. Expect a letter! Don't expect a reply! May God give, in His grace, A Christmas without sorrow. Those who had faith are far away Those who upheld religion At home now worship God and pray In some strange, distant region Others who fought, and now are dead Lie in a dreamless silence; May God, in His compassion, spread A veil above the violence They're good, Ellis. Aren't they, father? They said this War would be over by now. At least farmers don't have to go. Bob says he's going. And others who have gone away across the grumbling seas; Our longing for them, night and day Is carried by the breeze There will come a glorious week... When, again, old friends I'll seek: No more yearning; I'm returning... To my home upon the peak. On the mountain I can see Someone beckoning to me; Up the hillside, as I climb... Heart and foot both beat in time; Are you all right? Ellis? Don't fool around! You're so childish sometimes! Children like to play, don't they? Don't get too excited! Bob's bleeding! What happened? Nothing! He's been beaten up. Fetch Ifan and your father for tea. They're tending the sheep. But we're tired. And starving! Go! Who did it? The village boys. Why? Because of you! Their brothers are in the army and you're not. At least I've a sister in the army! What do you mean? Cati's joined the Land Army. You're up early, Mam. I couldn't sleep. Cati will be fine. Don't worry. She's never been away from home. My family's being torn apart. Your brother, Dafydd, in New Zealand. And now Cati. Oh, I didn't hear you. So you're Enid's new teacher! Yes, and you're her big brother! Poetry? You have a lovely name. Ellis? It's not unusual. I meant Hedd Wyn. It's lovely here. Even the river is singing. Sometimes, I throw poems into it. Why? I don't know. Perhaps the water will carry... ..imperfect poems back to their source. So that they return to me stronger. He searched for his lost maiden-love Whose heart was once his home, And for her sake this world of woe In sorrow he would roam. His one wish was to free her From this world of cruelty, And sail to the enchanted land Across the emerald sea. She's too young for you, Ellis. She's the same age as me! I don't want her hurt... Or anyone else, for that matter. Who are you taking to Bangor? I'm not going to the Eisteddfod. What if you won? They don't tell you in advance. William will tell me what happened. Doesn't make sense to me. You've waited a year for the adjudication... ..and now you're not going. Perhaps I've waited too long! The Reverend's having difficulty! What the hell's he doing here? But you can't give up now. Just because you've lost once. You don't understand. It's hard to explain. Listen, I waited a whole year... ...only to be told I was terrible! The adjudicators slayed me! But one of them praised you. He was trying to be kind. There's no point. I'm not good enough, and that's it! No girl will look at us again. I couldn't hold a woman anyway. Still, this War's over for us. It hasn't started for some. Remember the lad whose head was blown off? Kept running like a bloody chicken! Look, lads, I'm sorry for you... ..but there's no need for this. What's wrong - afraid? Afraid of hearing what we've gone through for you cowards? It's about time you and your bird knew! They can censor our letters, but not our mouths. Go on! I ought to give you a white feather! You haven't any wings, let alone feathers. Have you heard? Heard what? Bloody fool! Why the hell did he go? What was he fighting for? Do you know? Did Griff know? I thought you'd be here. Did you? Going to throw the poem into the water, are you? What use is poetry these days? Griff Penlan? One more from Trawsfynydd. Perhaps you should write about the War. I don't understand this War. I've no experience... We all have experience of it. You don't have to be a soldier. I'm soaking, Ellis. This poem has a purpose after all! So this is Hedd Wyn... bard! No. I'm Ellis. Give me your coat. Let us pray for peace... ..and for the souls of the fallen. I'm sorry about Griff. Yes. What a waste! See you, Elsyn. Bye, Lizzie. Haven't seen you around lately. Are you better? Yes, a little. I've been staying with my sister. You haven't enlisted, then? No. I'm not married either. You were right about this War. It's a curse! I said nothing against the War. I only said I couldn't kill anyone. You were right anyway. I want you to know. Who is she then? I was far away. You departed before you started! I was thinking of the poem. It's almost finished. And I've almost finished with you! Poetry, indeed. That's all you think about. Poetry - and women. About time you helped Father. He's getting older, Ellis. What's wrong with you? I've decided to go to England. To do something to help the boys who are dying... Have you told Mam? You look tired, Mam. Sit down. I'll make some tea. I don't care what people say. What's wrong? The village women, what do they know? They want me to send my sons. I've already buried four children! Don't you dare join up, Ellis. I know about losing children. I'm dying, Elsyn. Try to rest. Is it sunny outside? Yes. I'd like to go out into the sun. You soon will. Are you trying for the Chair this year? Yes. The poem's finished. I'm glad. Remember that trip you promised me. I remember. I don't want you chaired without me. Do you promise? I promise. She died in her youth, when trees With song of birds were thronging; And now on the summer's breeze I hear the song of longing. Careful! Watch that blade! Ellis, get out of sight now! Why? Do as I say. Go on! Don't tell him anything! Does he mean Ellis, Mam? What does he mean, Mam? There's no need to worry. The land must be farmed. Ellis! Wait! Have you seen The Brython? No. Why? You came second at Aberystwyth. One of the adjudicators thought you were the best! The best, Ellis! Second this year, First next time! A natural progression! Perhaps. We'll see. I have to appear before a tribunal. Just a formality, Ellis. You don't have to go. I've no choice! They said you or Bob. He's not yet eighteen! Plenty of young lads go. He's too young! But he wants to go, Ellis! Do you really expect me to stay? What if he was killed? Be sensible. Bob wants to go and you don't. - The choice is obvious! - Is it? - You promised. - No! Don't worry, Jini! Do you want me to leave? I think you should decide, Evan. You're the head of the family. How can I choose, Mary? They're both my sons. It's the first time you've let Father make any decisions! It's nothing to do with you. This is between me and Bob. I can't understand why we're arguing. I want to go, Ellis doesn't. It's that simple! I am going. Oh, yes. Only because I want to! The same old story every time. For God's sake, Bob, grow up! You're not even eighteen yet. I'm old enough to look after myself! Old! Don't talk daft! You haven't begun to live yet! Don't get married without telling us. I won't. Goodbye, Father. Don't work the boys too hard. Take care, Ellis. Don't worry about me. I'll he able to finish my poem. Plenty of spare time in training camp, so they say. Come here - your tie's crooked. Don't forget to write. Any excuse to put pencil to paper. Go, Ellis, you'll miss the train. Goodbye, Bob. Bye Ellis. Lost for words, for once, Ellis? Nothing else to say, is there? You'd better get on! Expect a letter from me! Isn't the Army for real men? They can't expect me to march across France in these! God, Trawsfynydd! You look a real soldier. You deserve a stripe just for looking good. Shut your gob! - What's the matter, Ellis? - I can't write! If you want a good night out, come with us next time. Liverpool's full of widows and lonely women! Be careful, Owen... ...or you'll have more than memories! Think I'm daft? I'd rather go home with VD ... ..than die with a V.C.! You've soon forgotten your roots! Must you sing English filth? It's French, not English! Sing something better then! Here's a verse! I once knew an ugly fellow, whose face was as black as coal; His waist was as thin as a worm, And as black as tar was his hole. Send him to France and the War'll be over! What's wrong, Mam? Aren't you glad to see me? Of course I am! Go and change those clothes. Dinner's almost ready. It doesn't make sense. They send us to the Army... "and once we've joined... ..they send us back to farm! There's not a lot to do. Plough a field or two, that's all. How's your poem coming along? I didn't do much in Litherland. I'm beginning to despair. Perhaps you'll get a chance now... ..whilst you're home. I hope so. Why was I born into this age In which mankind has exiled God? With God departed, man, with rage, Now wields the sceptre and the rod. And when man knew that God had gone To spill his brother's blood he bore His eager sword, and cast upon Our homes the shadow of the War. The harps to which we sang are hung On willow boughs, and their refrain Drowned by the anguish of the young Whose blood is mingled with the rain. It's so sad, Ellis. I wanted you to hear it first. As a kind of a parting gift? Yes, I suppose. Is that it... Hedd Wyn? Nothing but words? Words don't come that easy. Maiden, we shall triumphant be, And every storm shall cease, And love will be released once more To wander through the trees. I walked with martyrs for your sake, Your soul must now have risen, Because I heard your plaintive voice Through the steel locks of prison. God, my feet hurt. I've got blisters as big as a sow's tits. It's fine for them, on horseback all day. I'd prefer a blistered arse to sore feet! Who is she this time? I'm afraid, Ellis. We'll come through. You'll see. I'll carry my Bible in my left pocket... ...so I won't be shot through the heart. Don't worry. We'll look after you. Aren't you worried? I'm more worried about my poem. I don't even know if it's been passed I've always had a dream, Bob, to win the National Eisteddfod. Now, perhaps... ...my last chance has gone. You said... we'll come through all right. "I like the life of killing lice." Does that alliterate, Ellis? Yes, Owen. Sackful of lies! All of us lying to our families. You told them you'll be killed tomorrow, Fred? We shan't all be killed. We're in the bloody first wave! Refuse to go..that's what we should do. And get shot by our own boys! How many of us will return? One, maybe; probably none. What the bloody hell are we doing here? I've never seen a German, let alone killed one. They're just the same as us. They want this War over... so they can go home. The Devil's children, according to some ministers. With one horn instead of two. Bloody preachers! Let's talk about something else. We'll have plenty of War, tomorrow. Look where you're pissing! It's a fucking massacre! Off we go! And in the morning's golden rays We both shall be united; The dawn Of that enchanted land Through darkness we have sighted. When this cruel War is over With its anguish and its pain, Our old haunts we shall revisit, And I'll be with you once again. The harps to which we sung are hung On willow boughs, and their refrain Drowned by the anguish of the young Whose blood is mingled with the rain. What is it, Magi? A telegram's arrived from Birkenhead. Ellis has won the Chair. Oh, no. My poor boy!
