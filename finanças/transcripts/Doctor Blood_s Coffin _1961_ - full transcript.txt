Stop it! I told you that under no circumstances were you to carry out this experiment. [Doctor] Yes, because you were afraid. No, I've been a fool. I should've realized that even if you are the most brilliant of my pupils, your vanity will force you to go on. I should've sent you away from here a year ago. [Doctor] But you didn't because you too wanted to go on with this experiment, but you needed someone to give you courage and I supplied it for you. We were experimenting with animals, not with human beings. No one has the right to take a human life for any reason whatsoever! [Doctor] The man I'm experimenting with is already doomed to die. He's suffering from something. Oh, you can excuse in any way you'd like, but I forbid you to use this laboratory. In fact, if you haven't left Vienna within 24 hours, I will hand you over to the police. Now, get out! (ominous music) Doctor? Hello, Linda. What's going on? There's another person missing. Bill Benson. Are you sure? Yes. He hasn't been seen since yesterday morning. Oh, and the sergeant's back from St. Ives. Can I help you with these? Thank you. Did you manage to replace everything? Yes, everything. I had to go to Truro for the microscope. Oh, dear. Right. Better 90 see what they're up to. [Linda] All right. (door closes) (suspenseful music) I'd like to know what's happened around here. It's only been three days since Charlie Bowman disappeared. And now Bill Benson's gone. [Man] Well, as for Benson, the only thing we've got to go on is the fact that his stuff was still in his room. [Man] And his money. He just paid my office another visit. This time they took the glucose from the refrigerator. Glucose? Used for intravenous feeding. You think there's any connection between the disappearing and the doc's supplies? I don't know what to think. [Man] Well, whoever it is must be around here somewhere. Well, there aren't many places to hide. The village is small enough. It wouldn't take us long to search it. Oh, no, no, no. It's not the village. He must be out in the open country. There's cliffs, and caves, the old tin mines. What about the mine? It's got miles of tunnels leading down under the village. Now that's an idea. They might be there. George, you know more about that than anyone else. [George] Mm-hmm. We could start a search first thing in the morning. George, would you lead it? Glad to. Fine, thanks. Well, Doc. We'll have a look at your refrigerator. (tense music) (snoring) (grunting) (syringe breaks) (waves crashing) Hello. Is the doctor in? [Linda] Have you got an appointment? In a way, yes. He must've taken it himself and forgotten it was in the book. I'll let him know you're here. Oh, what's your name? Blood. Oh, I'm sorry. Of course, you're Peter. We just didn't know what time to expect you. I'd have been here sooner if I'd known. I'll have to speak sternly to my father. [Linda] Why? He neglected to tell me anything about you. But I know all about you. He showed everyone your letters. Oh, and he framed the one from Professor Luckman. Telling all about your brilliant career ahead of you. Sounds as if I've got a lot to live up to. You certainly have. The whole town's seen it. By the way. Oh, I'm sorry. Linda. Mrs. Linda Parker. How do you do? [Man] (laughs) Let's have a look. I'll tell the doctor that you're here. No, no. No, I'll surprise him. (knocking on door) (laughs) Well, Peter. Well, it's good to see you. Hello, Mr. Morton. Let's have a look. How's it feel to be back in England again? Wonderful. How are things with you? Oh, fine. Haven't changed much, you know? Yeah, I can see you're still playing chess. [Morton] Did you have a good time in Vienna, Peter? Well, you know, Mr. Morton. They had us working there for four years. We didn't have much opportunity to get about. They kept us cooped up in that lab most of the time. [Morton] And what are you gonna do now, Peter? Oh, I'm going to relax. Take it easy for a month or two. Well in my day, we didn't have time to relax. There were no grants, you know. Just had to go home and put up your plate. No specialization, no fellowship. You just started curing backaches and colds. You wanted me to take that research grant. Well, nowadays things are different. You get your degree and then you specialize. And then the representatives of all the best hospitals come begging to give you a job. Oh, the opportunities for young doctors these days. (laughs) Well, I'll have a wash and then we can celebrate your arrival with a cup of coffee. You can celebrate with coffee. I never touch the stuff. Here's to a pleasant stay, Peter. If you get a chance, come by and see me sometimes. I will. Thanks, Mr. Morton. So long now, Doctor. Bye. That Morton, what a character. Well, it may sound selfish of me, but I was hoping you'd pick something nearer home, you know? Truro, perhaps. There's a very good hospital in Plymouth. As a matter of fact, I went over there the other day. Saw Davidson, he's head of research. He suggested you come see him. Yeah, well I'll think about it. At the moment, I just want to relax. Well, you've got plenty of time. Yeah, that's true. I might even stay right here in Porthcarron. What on earth are you gonna do in Porthcarron? No one's ever really here. They're all died up like old Morton. Remember, I'm a biochemist, not a GP. All I need is a Bunsen burner, a test tube, and a few chemicals. (knocking on door) Doctor, Sergeant Cook is outside. He'd like to talk to you. [Doctor] Ask him to come in. Uh, she... She did say missus, huh? Oh, yes. Her husband was killed in an accident about a year ago. Oh, you remember him. Steve Parker. He used to be a surveyor here. [Peter] Parker, surveyor, huh? No, no, no, no. You probably were in Vienna by then. Yes, it was a terrible tragedy. She came to work for me after that. Oh, Sergeant. I don't think you know my son Peter. This is Sergeant Cook. How are you, Peter? Nice to know you. Peter's a real of Porthcarron. He was born here. Does he know about the excitement? Well, he's only been here for about five minutes. [Cook] Is this one of yours? It's our first clue. Ah. Well, it's difficult to say. Linda. (gasps) It might've had some prints on it. I'm sorry. Yes, Doctor? The sergeant would like to know whether this hypodermic is one that was stolen. Well, we did have one just like it. They're not common, Doctor. Well, I'd like you to analyze whatever's in that needle, Doctor. It could tell us what happened to George Beale. George Beale? Yeah, he's missing this morning. His bedroom's been knock about a bit. We found some blood and this needle. Looks as though he's been kidnapped. Of course, that could explain the other disappearances. Seemed that Beale knew those tunnels better than anyone else. [Peter] Kidnapping in Porthcarron? Well, three people have disappeared. My surgery's been broken into twice. The sergeant thinks whoever it is is hiding in those old mine tunnels. Well, I know those mine tunnels pretty well. I used to play down there when I was a kid. I've got some men waiting to start searching them, but. I'll show you around if you'd like. Peter, you've just come back. You must be tired. Yeah, and if there is someone in those tunnels, it could be dangerous. I'm a good runner. Well, he does know the tunnels. We certainly could use your help. Come on. Fine. Look, I'll just get my bags and then I'll be with you. Right. I'll be back later for your analysis on that stuff, huh? Please, put this in the lab, Linda. Yes. Careful. (tense music) (metal clangs) Now, let me see. This is the southern section. If I remember, the one up there's bigger. I think you and I better take that one, Sergeant. You stay here and I'll show these fellas how to get in here. Now, the main tunnel here connects up to the entrance of the other section. And if you find anything, it'll be your quickest way to reach us. Now a lot of smaller ones leading off the main one and I suggest one of you stays in this tunnel with his lamp light and then none of you will get lost. See you later. Right. Let's go. That's the one. Watch it. I think this is it here. (tense music) It all looks so different. I think we split up into two tunnels here. And if I remember correctly, they join up again in about 300 yards. You take that one. [Cook] Right. Yell if you see anything. [Peter] Don't worry, I will. (tense music) (groans) (breathing heavily) Peter? Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter? Peter! I'm all right. Stay where you are, Sarge. I'm coming. Where are you? I'm sorry I was so long. This tunnel was longer than I remembered. You all right? Yeah. I thought you'd run into something. No. Let's get started. The others will be waiting. Right. Well, did you find anything? Nothing, Sarge. Well, that's it, Sergeant. Between us, we've been through every inch of those tunnels. Okay, thanks. See you later, Peter. Yeah. [Linda] Hello. Hi. Your father's still working on the analysis. He doesn't seem to be able to break it down. So he sent me out to pick you up. Kind of you. (engine starts) (tires squealing) You practicing for the Grand Prix? Those mines go way under the village. I'm told the tunnels go on for miles and miles. I've never actually been inside them. I've lived here for nearly three years and I haven't even been to the entrance to the tunnels. I suppose if I did go, I'd probably lose my way anyway. You're not even listening to me. I'm sorry. What were you saying? I was talking about the mines. I was saying I've never been inside them. Well, you haven't missed anything. Besides, you probably would've got lost. That's what I said. Whew. Well, that's the fastest ride I've had in a very long time. Thanks for picking me up. Well, I won't detain you any longer. I expect your father's waiting to see you. Yeah. I expect he is. Well, goodbye. See you tomorrow. [Peter] Yeah. (tense music) (suspenseful music) I I carried her safely down on the farm J“ I But oh, how I ♪ Good morning, Mr. Morton. Oh, good morning, Peter. I've been waiting for that visit you promised me. I've got my whole place cleaned up in your honor. Oh, you shouldn't have done that. I know. Every time I do, a body is brought in there. I'm told that nobody ever dies in Porthcarron. Come to think of it, that's true. Then, I never clean up either. Trouble is, your father is too good a doctor. Bad for my business. Yeah. Well, I'll tell him. Remember to come and see me. Yeah, I will. Hello, Peter. You're up early. [Peter] No sleep runs in the family these days. Anyway, I had to get up early to pick you these. Oh, thank you. They're lovely. Mm. Just like the ones I picked for myself this morning. You found me out. It was a sweet though anyway. Well, here's another one. How about going into Sundai's for lunch sometime? I'd love to. Who's with the doctor? Oh, the sergeant. And if you're going in there, would you mind taking the coffee? My pleasure. Thank you. Am I interrupting anything? No. Come on, come in. The doctor needs a doctor. He's been up all night. [Blood] Know anything about active alkalides, Peter? Well, I've spent an awful lot of your money learning biochemistry. Try me. Well, I've done the quantitative analysis. There's carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen in it. What without a quantitative, it could be almost anything. Did you do a Kelvedon for the nitrogen? Two atoms to the molecule. The oxygen and the others, I don't know. If you only had a bigger sample. Yes, I could distill, crystallize, precipitate, filter. But there's only one drop. Just one drop. How about a spectrum? Well, the nearest one's in Plymouth hospital. We could send it there. Well, I could take it down there and do the test myself. No, no, no. You've done enough already. I'll take it. Linda! Now, wait a minute, Doc. You need some sleep. Nothing that black coffee won't cure. You better go off home and get some rest, Linda. Right. I'm going off to Plymouth. Peter will look after the office. Look after the place. All these new instruments haven't been insured yet, you know. I'll walk you down to your car. Could I have some of that coffee? I'll get you a cup. Here we are. [Peter] Thank you. I thought you had the day off. I have. I'm just going to tidy up here, then I'm going to leave you to hold the fort. A girl could do with a day off occasionally. What on earth is this? That's a souvenir from Carlo. One of my classmates at the university in Vienna. It's a container for an arrow poison made by the natives of South America. Curare. Yeah, that's right. You know, that has an interesting history. That used to belong to Carlo's great grandfather. He was a witchdoctor for a tribe on the Orinoco. That's a fine old medical background. Carlo had a more interesting background than that. His father discovered a diamond mine and made him one of the richest natives of South America. What's inside it? Carlo's sense of humor. Honey. Pure honey. Taste. No thank you. Peter? Peter. Hey, can you come right away? [Peter] What's the matter? It's George Beale. They found him in the ravine below the old water tower near the mine. Is he alive? Yeah, the boys are bringing him up right now. I've got the car outside, I'll take you right over. I'll be out in a minute. Linda, where's the... Oh, thanks. Get me some adrenaline, huh? Right. Here we are, Peter. Thanks. You better stand by. I may have to bring him back here. [Linda] Right. (engine revving) What's his condition like? Well, I didn't have much time with him. He seemed in a pretty bad way. Was he conscious? Did he recognize you? He seemed to be mumbling something. I couldn't make out what it was. The boys are trying to bring him around now though. Giving him some brandy when I left. (engine racing) (tense music) (gasping) [Man] Don't worry, George. The doctor's here now. (George mumbling) (subdued music) I'll do a post mortem back at the mortuary. [Cook] All right, boys. We'll take him back to the mortuary. (knocking on door) Put him right here on this slab. I knew it. I knew it, it never fails. The minute I clean this place up. It's George Beale. [Peter] Mr. Morton. Mr. Morton. What did I say? Bad luck, it never fails. [Peter] My father had to go to Plymouth. I'm doing the post mortem for him. All right. Back in there, Peter. Help yourself. I'm afraid you won't be able to bleed him until I finish my tests. If I can't finish now, I'll be back later. Well, there's no hurry. He won't be going anyplace. Besides, I've got plenty to do. Preparing the embalming fluid. I mix that myself. Not many old timers left that can do it. Everything comes in tins these days. Well, I'll leave the front door open, so just make yourself at home. Fine. Thanks, Mr. Morton. So long for now. (tense music) [Peter] Hey, did I ever tell you I was a group leader in the cubs? [Linda] No, you did not. Yeah, well I was. That's where I got my inspiration. Ooh. Sorry. I know it's commonly thought that all cubs, when they grow up, want to become engine drivers. But what got me were those nature rambles. Do you know that I had analyzed the protein value of an acorn by the time I was six? Fascinating. And when did you find out that you were destined for better things? Well, I remember my section leader giving me a stethoscope and a Bunsen burner for an end-of-term prize. From then on, I never looked back. Come on. Oh, no. Come on. Ooh. So that's how you became a doctor. I always thought doctors like you came ready-made. That just shows you how wrong you can be. Even I had to go through primary school, secondary school. I even had to go to university. Ooh, I feel sorry for you. You had a time. Then to think you should finish up with a four-year research grant in Vienna. (tongue clicking) All I got for my studies was two weeks practice at a hospital in Grimsby. Oh. You must've had a wonderful time living it up in Vienna. [Peter] Living it up? I was in the laboratory most of the time. Hmm, sounds very dull. You're so wrong. When you become really interested in something as fascinating as biology, and chemistry, and the relationship between them. We had a professor in Vienna. He was an old man, brilliant. He had the knowledge and the perception, but he lacked courage. He saw the possibilities of going on, but he held back. He held me back. He would progress so far, then stop. One day we were in the middle of an experiment. We were working on skin graft and the rejection reaction of the body. We stood in that laboratory. Suddenly, the whole world was open to us. There were no barriers, no restrictions, no limitations. We were on the brink of a discovery. I wanted to go on, but I was stopped by ignorance and superstition. So authority shut down on my ideas. They will call upon any excuse to avoid going further than their minds can conceive. Those nature rambles certainly inspired you. [Peter] I just hate people standing over me. I must be free to go my own way. No one's going to hold me back. Peter, why don't you go to see Davidson at Plymouth like your father suggested? What are you trying to do get rid of me? No, of course not. I was just trying to tell him I think you'd like it. You sure you haven't been conspiring with my father? No. It's for your own good. That's funny. I'd worked everything out, but I hadn't bargained for you. (sweeping music) (suspenseful music) (metal clanging) Go back to your room, Mr. Morton. [Morton] I've seen a lot of post mortems in my time, Peter. Look, I haven't got time to talk now, so please go upstairs and leave me alone. Peter, he's alive. Mr. Morton, I discovered with the tests I made that Beale had been injected with a poison called curare. It paralyzed him completely so that he had all the appearances of death. I'm afraid it's too late to save him now. You've gotta do something, Peter. Get help. Something. Look, you knew Beale. He was no good to anyone. Hung around the pub all the time instead of making something of himself. And it's too late. If I can keep this heart alive, it can help me with one of the greatest discoveries of science. But you can't kill him! I'm going to take this heart and put it into a dead body. I'm going to give life to someone who's dead. If I succeed. Don't do it. Please, don't do it! Don't. Look, if you don't quit now the heart will die. (groans) Don't do it, Peter. Think of your father. Get away from me! (metal clangs) Why did you have to interfere in something you didn't. (heart beating) (dramatic music) Now I have to find another heart. Peter, are you up? Coffee, Peter. Are you up yet, Peter? Morning. What happened to you? Morton didn't show up. I had to do the embalming myself. You still have any of that coffee this morning? Could be. Maybe he just had one too many last night. He wasn't in his room. [Linda] Are you sure? His things were there. No Morton. Maybe he stayed with a friend or something. I don't think so. He doesn't go out very much except for an occasional game of chess with your father. Well, I searched all over. He didn't turn up all night. I'm worried, Peter. I think we should tell the sergeant. Peter? Good bye. Hello. This is a fine way for a girl to spend a day off. Well, I'm trying to catch up on all the things I should've done during the week. I've got a much better idea. Come on. [Linda] Oh, I. We'll go for a drive. [Linda] Well, I don't. Yeah, come on. [Linda] Oh, all right. Come on. You know these derelict mines are scattered all over this coastline. It's hard to believe that they've taken millions of pounds of tin out of 'em. Oh, looks awfully deserted to me. [Peter] The ones lower down are mostly flooded out. Ooh, looks empty and dead. Well, let's bring it to life again. You must've had enough of tunnels. Besides, I'm scared. Nurses don't get scared. Come on. Don't you believe it. Are you sure it's safe in here? [Peter] Nothing to worry about. Here, you hold the light. I used to come down here often when I was a kid. Weren't your parents worried about you? My mother died when I was five years old. My father was far too busy to keep an eye on me. I used to go all the way down this tunnel to my secret palace. [Linda] Weren't you afraid? It's awfully dark in here. When I got to my palace I'd lie on the ground with my hands folded across my chest and think how it felt to be buried inside a big mountain. Sounds weird to me. One day I'd be Loki, god of the Norsemen. Buried inside my great hole in the mountain of Valhalla. Another day I'd be an Egyptian Pharaoh sealed away in my tomb in the great pyramid. Then I'd come to life. Rise out of my coffin and come back into the world. And nobody ever guessed the secrets locked away in my ancient brain. Whether it's you or the Pharaohs, but I've got goose flesh. [Peter] You don't have to worry about the Pharaohs. I gave them strict instructions to stay out of sight today. Just the same, I think we ought to go back. No, you are going to stay here locked away with me forever. Peter, you scare me. I'm serious. You must remain within these dank walls for all eternity. No light, no hope, no chance of escape. There's only one way in which you can buy your freedom. (dramatic music) Oh, I saw you coming in. Are you lost? Name's Tregaye. Hope I didn't scare ya. I must look a bit frightening. Been meaning to shave for the past week. But no one ever comes up here so I keep putting it off. Dropped your flashlight. [Linda] Thank you. I'll show you the way out. (tense music) Oh, Peter. [Peter] Hi. What time did you go to the mortuary to finish the post mortem on Beale? Oh, about 9:30, quarter to 10. Have you got some bead on someone? No, I was just trying to establish the exact time of his disappearance. [Peter] Oh, I see. Oh, don't let me keep Linda waiting. Right. Thanks. See you. (tense music) For it is he who giveth and he who taketh away. Dust is man and man is dust and to dust he returns. And now we commit the body of George Beale to provide and to care. Amen. (bell tolling) Peter, can I give you a lift? No. I'll wait for Linda. How was your husband killed, Linda? Left the house one morning, drove through the village. A child run out in front of his car. He swerved. 10 minutes after he left the house they phoned to tell me he'd been killed. What a waste. Terrible. (seagulls cawing) [Peter] Morning. Hello there. Sorry for bursting in on you and your girlfriend the other day. [Peter] No harm done. I thought all the ore was worked out of these mines. Well, there isn't enough to keep a mine working. I manage to scrape out a living though. Nothing big. Still, you never know what you might find. A pal of mine, he lived up north. He used to work in an old coal mine. He was digging out one day, he struck some gold. He thought he'd struck it rich. It turned out to be something somebody buried hundreds of years before. He made a lot of money out of it though. Gives you something to hope for. You never know what you're gonna find. I'm getting hungry. I've got something cooking down there. You're welcome to come and join me. [Peter] Thanks. Well, I'm not sure this looks very professional. [Peter] Welcome home. Another beer, please. Peter, I wish you'd done this analysis instead of me. Oh, their equipment is excellent. The next time you have time off, drive down and have a look at that lab with me. It's a beauty. It's a scientist's dream. There's everything that you could possibly want. Hello there. Linda, you've come just in time. I've been lead astray. Join us? Oh, no. Too many calories. The word calories is every woman's poison. I'm surprised that the whole sex isn't dying of malnutrition. How did the analysis go? Did you discover what it was? Strychnos toxifera. Curare? You sure? [Blood] Absolutely. How extraordinary. Linda and I were talking about curare the other day. A classmate of mine gave me one of the original containers. Dates back to the 16th century. I'm sorry to burst in on you like this. Oh, hello, Sergeant. It's about a miner called Tregaye. He's over in the mortuary. He's got a gash in his head which seems to have been caused by a beam in one of the tunnels. But it doesn't seem bad enough to have killed him. I told him only the other day he shouldn't be up there alone. See anybody else around? Oh, no, no. Not a soul. There's no telling how long he would've been up there if it hadn't been for a boy from the garage. Took him some oil for his crusher. Peter, I'd like you to find out the time and cause of death as soon as possible. Are you trying to retire me, Sergeant? Well, you better get used to it. I said I might stay right here in Porthcarron. Well, Doc. How was your trip to Plymouth? Did you find out what was in that needle? Strychnos toxifera. Commonly called curare. Curare? (tense music) I've got it, Linda. There are three kinds of curare distinguished by the methods of packing. Tube, or bamboo, curare put up in bamboo tubes. Pot curare in small brown earthen pots. Calabash, or good curare in goods. Sounds like the native canning season. May I see that, please? Yeah, help yourself. Thank you. Three o'clock. I better get up to the mine and examine the place where the body was found. Curare is exceedingly poisonous when introduced into the bloodstream, but is non-poisonous when taken through the mouth. Well, I certainly hope it's an accidental death. I'd hate another murder on my hands. Oh, and tell the doctor I'll call in on my way back. Honey. (door closes) Peter, can I have a word with you? Sure. Sergeant Cook has just handed me a copy of your report on Beale's death. What about it? Well, curare paralyzes the ends of the motor nerves of the voluntary muscle then it sends to the nerve trunks. Death is caused by respiratory paralysis. What about it? Well, your report suggests that death was caused by malfunction of the heart. That's correct. George Beale was an old patient of mine. He had one of the best hearts I've known in all my years of practice. Well, the tests I made didn't show the presence of curare in the body. I can assure you there's nothing wrong with this report. So if that's all you wanted to talk about, there's nothing more to say. Peter, George Beale's dead. I mean, your report isn't going to alter that. But if you had made a mistake like this, well, it could very much affect your future. Well, since you still seem convinced that the report is wrong, you could ask Sergeant Cook to exhume the body and do a post mortem yourself. Oh, don't be ridiculous. I only meant that if you had slipped up... Well, as Davidson said the other day, research in a laboratory is very different to practical experience. Naturally, we talked about you and he suggested it would be a very good idea for you to have a year in a big hospital. I don't want to be patronized by Davidson or anyone else. I don't want to work in a big hospital and have some board watching every move I make. But he didn't mean to patronize you. He only meant that if you were in a big hospital, you could have someone to guide you, someone to talk over your problems with. Look, all supervision's ever done for me is hold me back. I must be free to go my own way and not have someone looking over my shoulder all the time! Peter, I wondered if you'd finished that report for me. Yeah, I'll go get it for you. [Cook] That's two fees the county owes you. Well, maybe my father would like to check that I haven't made any mistakes. See you at the house, peter. Bye, Sergeant. Don't be too hard on him, Doc. After all, it's all in the family. Here you are. Accidental death by multiple concussion and internal hemorrhage. He'd been dead about three hours when I examined him. Oh. Oh, thanks, Peter. Okay. Oh, Peter. Those tests you made, would they have show any sign of this curare poison? Oh, yes. I think so. I didn't find anything. But if you're not happy with it, we could send a sample to Plymouth and have another analysis. Oh, no. No. Thanks, Peter. (phone rings) Hello? Dr. Blood's office. No, I'm afraid the doctor isn't taking calls tonight. Yes. Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you. Good bye. (knocking on door) Doctor, Mrs. Hawkins telephoned. She'd like you to call and see her son. Let me get you something to eat, Doctor. Maybe some hot soup? No thanks. I'm just not hungry. It's not what he said. He should've talked it over with me. I better go. No, you're much too tired to go out tonight. I'll see if I can find Peter and ask him to go. (dramatic music) I told you that in Vienna I was on the brink of one of the greatest discoveries known to man, but I was stopped because they were afraid. Well, I came home to complete that experiment. What experiment? You saw today out at the mine, a useless tramp. What good was he to himself or to anybody else? You can't let a man die so that you can discover something. It doesn't matter how important it is. That is murder. Well, everywhere men are dying. Great men, philosophers, artists, scientists. But if they could live on, look how they could contribute to the advancement of man. Tregaye's going to help me prove that I can give life where there was death. You still can't let a man die. You're a doctor. He's going to die, Linda. But in dying, he's going to help someone else live. Someone who deserves to live. Who are you to say who is to live and who is to die? You have no right to judge. Yes, I have. As a scientist I have the right. No, you have not. That right belongs to God because it is he alone who gives life. No. I can take Tregaye's heart, and with it I, too, can create life. That isn't creation. You have to kill to give your sort of life. [Peter] You're like the others. You want to limit man's province. No. What I say is that until you can create life out of nothing, then you have no right to take life. Try to understand. A scientist has to be ruthless and unafraid. No one has the right to put limitations on my work because of some outmoded superstitious belief. You want me to deny God, and instead to kneel down and worship a new god, science. No, Linda. I'm asking you to believe in me. To help me and share in my discovery. Never. Oh, how can you be so blind? Can't you see what it can mean to the world to let brilliant men go on living contributing to the greatness of man? You want the world to bow down to your greatness. You have the pride of Lucifer. Well, he also wanted to be equal with God and he suffered damnation for it. And anything that you conjure up will be in his image. You will use any excuse to stop me because you're frightened that I might succeed. No. No, I'm frightened of what you're doing to yourself. Oh, yes. You can give some sort of life to the body, but the men you are talking about aren't great because of their bodies. They're great because they use their minds and their souls which are in the image of God. All you will have will be a physical shell which will be evil. Is that what you want? I want to prove that science can overcome death. I want to prove that there is no limit to man's province. And if the only way I can do this is by calling on the power of evil, then I call on this power. I call on it to guide my brain, my eyes, my hands to prove that I'm right. And you're not rejecting me because you think I'm wrong. You're rejecting me because you think you betrayed your husband. You're still in love with Steve Parker. You still think of him as he was when he was alive, not as he is now, pinned down by a gravestone. (tube clattering) (dramatic music) (pounding on door) Sergeant. I'll have to issue a warrant. That's right. Send out a call to all squad cars. I want roadblocks set up on all roads leading out of the village. And I want 20 men sent over immediately. [Man On Phone] 20 men? 20 men. [Man On Phone] I've got every man out on a beat already. Look, I don't give a damn about your troubles, I've got enough worries here. I need 20 mean and I need them now. Yeah. And send out an alert to all neighboring towns and villages. And make it fast. (tense music) (heart beating) [Blood] Go home now, Linda. There's nothing more you can do. Are you sure? You are Steve Parker. You are Steve Parker. Steve Parker. Speak. Speak. Speak! Linda. (gasps) Don't make a sound. Cook here. Look, I'm waiting to start the search. I know it's still dark, but we've got to find him. Your men should be here by now. Look, we've gotta search every part of the town and surrounding countryside. Wood, drifts, caves, everywhere. Yes, that's right. Now send them over. (tense music) Where are you taking me? Stop. Stop! Peter, you're hurting me. Stop it. (dramatic music) (Linda screams) Yes, I've done it. But I wanted to create something worthwhile. You made me do this. This is what you rejected me for. I could forgive you if you were insane, but you're not. You're evil. And this is the result of your evil. You haven't brought Steve Parker back to life. This is something from hell. (screaming) (dramatic music) (grunting) (glass breaks) (Peter gasping) (waves crashing)
