This film is based on true events that took place in Korea, 2011 Honey, wake up and have breakfast. You'll be late for work. Honey! What the... What's that! Honey, what's this! You wanted to drink with him. Holy cow... Who did I drink with... I didn't drink much. All right, all right. I drank with In-ho, why is that here. Pollack soup... - You could open a diner. - Jeez... Min-woo's not eating? He's under the weather. I wanted him to sleep in. Yeah? Then bring him to the hospital. I'll give him a closer look. It's fine, you're busy. I don't want us to be a burden. If it gets worse, I'll take him to a clinic here. They're good too. Dad. Hey, good morning. Don't be sick, it hurts me too. Okay. When you're better, let's go to the amusement park. - Really? - Sure. - Promise. - Promise. Get some more sleep. You have to get better. Hankook Hospital I'm so starving. - Having your lunch now? - Yeah, sit down. I'm so sick of this hospital, I should really quit. Why are they increasing operating rooms when we're short on surgeons. Are we machines? You can't even file a proper complaint, shut up and eat up. You got another surgery. There are always surgeries. Your sister-in-law's really popular. She was trending with new articles. - Young-ju? - Yeah. You little prick! Did that hurt? So keep your dick inside. I'll castrate you next time. Supreme Court prosecutor Han Young-ju is trending online. It's due to her attack on a sexual predator, who is said to require a long treatment. Han Young-ju! Where's Han? She's on the field on an assignment. Tell that moron to come directly to my office, got that? Certainly, straight to your office! He's gone. You can come out now. I thought I was dead. Shall we go out for lunch? Short rib soup on me. - Deal! - Me too! - Hurry, hurry. - Short rib soup sounds so good. You're talking about the diner nearby, right? The broth is... Good day, Chief Prosecutor Lim. You got appetite to eat short rib soup right now?! You all are the same. Everyone, come with me! Is Min-woo okay? He got better, and went swimming. I don't know why Young-ju's causing so much trouble. She's coming by this weekend, so give her a good scolding. What for? She did something good for the world. I'm going to be late today, have dinner with Min-woo. All right, don't skip dinner. Okay. Time to prepare snack... Min-woo, you're not sick anymore? Nope! I'm not sick at all! Don't be sick. It's so boring without you. Yup, okay! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay, jump jump! Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. TOXIC Emergency Room Min-woo. What happened? I don't know. The coach called me and said he passed out. Is he going to be okay? Doctor, his breathing rate is dropping! This is bad, we have to get him to surgery now! If we stall any longer, he may go into cardiac arrest! Okay, then I'll come in with you. Please, no, Min-woo... Easy, be careful! Min-woo... I'm sorry, you can't go any further. Operating Room So, what happened? Is Min-woo okay? Tae-hoon, should I talk to her? No, I'll do it myself. Thank you. Why are you stalling? Let's go to my office. We can talk there. See this white region. That's Min-woo's lung. His lung is hard as a rock. It's likely acute form of pulmonary fibrosis. What? What happened to Min-woo's lungs? Whatever, I don't care, what's the treatment? Can it be treated? Can he recover with treatment? Min-woo. Mom's here. Could you look at me? Honey, can I see him inside? I want to see him just for a moment. Gil-ju, it's not possible right now. Let's check his condition in the morning. Min-woo, Mom's here. Open your eyes. Please look at me. Oh no... Are you okay to drive? I'm fine. I'm just going to pick up a few things for him. So watch over him until then. No need to hurry, drive safe. Will he be okay? Don't worry, he'll be fine. I'll be back. Min-woo will love this. Gil-ju, it's me! Gil-ju, I'm here! Min-woo, I brought your favorite robot? Eh? Are you in here? Gil-ju! Hey! Wake up! Gil-ju! Wake up! Gil-ju! What's wrong?! Gil-ju! Hey! Tae-hoon... What do we do... Honey... Gil-ju. Why are you like this? You said you'd be back... Don't kid around and get up. This isn't funny... Gil-ju... What about Min-woo... Funeral Home Deceased: Han Gil-ju My deepest condolences. What was the cause? Something must've come up by now. Pulmonary fibrosis, same as Min-woo. 2/3 of her lungs... were already hardened. Can it happen so suddenly? She didn't look sick at all. It looks to be at least a year... How could I have not known... Wait a minute. What did you just say? At least a year? Are you sure about that? Even if it's an acute form, it can't progress that rapidly. Then something's wrong, something's not right! We didn't say anything so that you wouldn't worry, but she and I had a full check-up 5 months ago here, but they never mentioned any symptoms like that. Radiology You were right. Her lungs were clean without any traces of fibrosis. We can't send her off like this. April 3, 2011. Current time, 11:30 a.m. Han Gil-ju, born 1973. I'll now begin the autopsy. How's this possible... How could a lung harden so badly? We did a bronchoalveolar lavage and sent it to KCDC. We received a report this morning that it was not a specific virus. We ran blood and culture tests as well, and found no evidence of poisoning or infection. We found an abnormal finding from the biopsy. There was some inflammation near the bronchus. Only the alveolus connected to the bronchial tubes were damaged. I've attached the documents on the back. So there's a high likelihood that a foreign agent entered the respiratory system. Anything else? I searched articles related to this in recent years, and I found a doctor who discovered and studied the pulmonary disease that's very close to this. Yeah? Who? Dr. Oh Jong-hak from Jungang Hospital. The pediatrician? Yes, that's correct. Dr. Oh quit early this year. He supposedly went back to his hometown for another job. Medical Journal "Unknown Pulmonary Fibrosis" Pardon me. Are you Jungang Hospital's Dr. Oh Jong-hak? Yes, who might you be? I'm Jung Tae-hoon, a fellow alumnus. I hope instant coffee is okay. Yes, thank you. What brings you to this far away land? This is my son. Acute pulmonary fibrosis? That's right, sir. It started in 2006 or so. I thought it was common cold at first. You son of a wench! Common cold?! How could it kill a person! Tell me the truth! What did you do to my child?! Tell me! It was quite strange. Not only my hospital but other hospitals already had many cases of similar illnesses. Had we conducted a proper epidemiologic survey... A survey was done on pulmonary fibrosis? Yes, but it didn't go well. What was the reason? Weird thing was, it went away during summer, fall and winter, and it'd reappear in the spring. Only in the spring? Yes, spring. April Medical Records This really is weird. How could new cases concentrate in the spring Over 80% of all cases. The rest was discovered later, but had early signs in the spring too. Could you find out their addresses? What for? We might get something if we conduct a survey. Acute Pulmonary Fibrosis Survey Sender: Jung Tae-hoon - Hello, Ms. Park Ye-in? - Yes. - Thank you. - Take care. Sender: Jung Tae-hoon What happened to the survey? Did anything come up? It's not easy. We didn't get a single reply. I'll send another one soon. What about visiting them? It'd be much faster. Chungwoo Car Center I'm Supreme Court prosecutor, Han Young-ju. I'd like to ask you about your late twins and wife. I lost my wife to the same illness. And my child could die at any moment. Shouldn't we at least know why? Oh my, it's a mess here. Baby stuff is left intact. Photograph this too? How could this happen to these babies... Could we really find the exact cause this way? Possibility will be greater if we dig deep into it. When did your granddaughter become sick? Last spring. Commendation She collapsed while training, and was diagnosed with acute pulmonary fibrosis. Are you all right? I heard you were also diagnosed with it recently. Yes. But I can still hold on. Please find the cause, Ms. Han. I feel so bad... Ma'am. I found these pills downstairs, what are these for? Most are for common cold. Ji-young and I always had cold. Did any of your family members or relatives had congenital lung or respiratory problems? No, not at all. I see. May I see her room? Sure, please follow me? Okay. Give me the camera, I'll go in alone. Okay. Ji-young, can you hear me? Would it be okay if I took some photos? She says it's okay, feel free to take them. Thank you. Min-woo's Timetable Sorry for lashing out, lately I feel weird Could it be menopause Thank you and love you always Honey, is that you? Fried rice is in the fridge, warm it up for dinner. You could do that, right? Humidifier? Yes, my home is quite dry. That room has humidifiers, 2 of them. Never raised any kids? Humidifiers are a must in a home with kids. Why. Something wrong? No, not at all. Korea Center For Disease Control & Prevention So you want to carry out an animal testing in Min-woo and Gil-ju's room? I think this is related to the humidifier. Both twins and Ji-young used the humidifier extensively. But pretty much all households use them. That's why I want to check the environmental factor. If it's used in a space without proper ventilation, mold or germs could grow. And depending on the person, those could prove fatal. Since my home retains the same condition, this test could give us something conclusive. Humidifier Activated Korea Center For Disease Control & Prevention We remained faithful to conditions you provided as we carried out the experiment. On the second week, all lab mice died of pulmonary fibrosis and complications. Was it because of germs like legionella or molds? No. We have found some traces of molds and germs, but the main cause of death was inhalation of PHMG. PHMG? What's that? Polyhexamethylene guanidine is used as a biocidal disinfectant. Or PHMG for short. That substance was detected in my home? To be precise, a massive amount was found inside the humidifier. World Health Organization's research concluded that prolonged inhalation of PHMG is fatal to lungs. Why was it in the humidifier? Spotless? Honey, what's this? Can't you read? It's a humidifier disinfectant. I saw on the TV that it prevents molds inside the humidifier. Min-woo's cough got worse, I wanted to give it a try. Good, it's got a safety certification from the government. Chief Prosecutor, Sir! No amount of tantrum and threats will work! Search and seizure warrant on what grounds?! And halting sale of a product isn't our jurisdiction. It's Ministries of Commerce or Health and Welfare. You know that already. Please leave. Fine! But listen to this. Sure, sure. You'll be partially responsible for all new patients and fatality cases. What did you say? Han Young-ju, moron! Stop right there! That brat... Yeah, it's me. Halting sale and seizure will be difficult. We will have to create some buzz around it first. I'll head over to the hospital now. Okay, let's summarize. Here are 2 things we know. It's not a virus, and it's possible to transmit through respiratory system. We can conclude 2 things from Dr. Oh's data. New cases pop up in the spring, and over 70% of the cases are either young children, pregnant women or housewives. Why? When the temperature dropped, humidifier usage became a necessity, and most of them spent majority of the winter indoors. Then why did their fathers not contracted the disease? Most men tend to sleep in separate rooms so as to not disturb their pregnant wives or children. Accounting for their time at work, their exposure was limited. We conducted an epidemiologic survey based on these data points, and had KCDC carry out an animal testing. The cause was PHMG, the O2's humidifier disinfectant. Okay, let's get the press release out there. Cause of an Unknown Lung Illness O2's Humidifier Disinfectant We have a shocking news. First released in November, 1994, humidifier disinfectant 'Spotless' has enjoyed 17 years of success, but according to doctors at Hankook Hospital, it is reportedly the main cause of a mysterious lung illness. KCDC held a separate briefing and confirmed the finding. Considering lung cancer is 10 times worse, and Hepatitis B 20 times worse than safe level, the disinfectant is 47.3 times worse, which is shockingly well over the fatal level. Spotless' manufacturer O2 is denying all wrongdoings and calls it a baseless allegation. They will be releasing an official statement soon. Everyone, what kind of company is O2? We have led into international markets through thick and thin. Global O2. I believe that O2's reputation must not be disgraced. We'll now go into emergency management. Do not waver and face the adversity head on. Out. What's Seo up to? Still on his sabbatical? I believe so, sir. Bring him in. Restricted Area Authorized Personnel Only Get the lab to send over all related files. Toxicity test of Spotless must be done The main component PHMG may pose danger to human body Woo-sik. Of Korea's 50 million population, how many of them do you think used Spotless? Over 10 million, perhaps. We sold at least that much. But did all 10 million people die? Just a few did. It's like unlucky traffic accidents. Woo-sik. When this wraps up nicely, I'm heading out to Malaysia. The UK headquarters promised me a spot as the Asian head. Then you'll take that seat. CEO Do this right. Yes, I understand. O2 Spotless Ingredient Analysis Report Hello, it's Seo Woo-sik. How about lunch? Woo-sik! Welcome, sir. Councilman. We drank too much in broad daylight. Good day, sir. - It's been a while. - Certainly. - Good to see you. - Let's go inside. - They got great beef here. - Is that so? Once this incident wraps up nicely, O2 will cover your campaign in the next election. It's not just about that, but O2 never did anything wrong. Hey, hey! You call this an article? Humidifier Disinfectant Behind Mysterious Lung Illness Have you fact-checked this? Where's due diligence? Retract that article, and swap it with the one that I prepared. I haven't been here in so long, but it feels so comfortable. You've been well, Prosecutor Lim? Yes, thanks to you. Han Young-ju is in your team, is this correct? That's right, councilman. The media is talking about her illegal investigation, what happened? That's not proven yet. But once proven, will you discipline her? She'll face a fair disciplinary action after the investigation. All right, that's enough. I thought we came here for tea. My apologies, Prosecutor Lim. It's a good spot, close to the hospital too. Where did you find a spot like this? Why are you suddenly looking for an office space? I left the prosecution office. What? Not a single lawyer wanted to represent the victims. How could I not act on it? It's not something else? Of course not. I can't believe this, they really are incredible. Did something happen? It's about O2. They removed all complaints on their homepage, and now they took out the bulletin board too. They lawyered up too. Who's representing them? Ryu Sang-moon? They're hitting hard? You know him? He's from the best law firm in Korea, and he's their hottest lawyer. He was the head of county high court. Wait, isn't that a big disadvantage for us? Favoritism and all. Don't worry. We can find a rightful opposition. Why would a big shot help us out? We're up against O2. There's one person like that. So you want me to co-chair the plaintiff? Yes. They must be after favoritism by retaining Ryu Sang-moon. Even if we submit solid evidence, the court and the prosecution will side with him. But if you stand on our side, I believe we'll have a fair investigation and trial. But why me? I thought of you as soon as I began this case. 'Do not walk away from injustice, so long as I stand here, no one can violate the law.' That's what you taught me. That's what I said? Let me apologize and take it back. Send me the files first. We can discuss more afterwards. I brought it with me just in case. I'll be off then. Drive safe and take care. Not at all. I hope I didn't put you in a tough spot by asking you. I'll come visit you again soon. It didn't work out? I knew it was a long shot. It's not easy finding people. This is bad. Since we're not from this field, we aren't much help. Is this Ms. Han Young-ju's office? Ms. Han! Congratulations on opening your firm! What took you so long? I was about to get mad? Have you had dinner? There's a great steak house around the corner, shall we? Steak? It feels like I'm being baited...? Of course not. - Let's go then! - Go! I was surprised that you resigned suddenly... This... - Please have a read. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. - Good morning. - Hello. Ma'am, please sign it here. Did you bring your seal? Yes, I brought it. Please go over there. - Thank you. - Okay. I received calls from 20-30 people today. - Yes. - Here... Good morning. Hello, you can sign here. The prosecution has not shown any sign of investigating this case because there was no evidence of illegality. It means we have to prove O2's guilt ourselves, but to be honest, individual lawsuits could take years to resolve. And with many hurdles to overcome, we may not win. However, have you heard of the Minamata incident? It began in Japan in 1932, and took 50 years, but in the end, the factory that leaked wastewater and government that let it happen all bowed their heads and apologized to the victims. This will be a hard and long fight, but we'll get our apology. I don't care how long it takes. I will fight those scumbags till the end. But, suing them will cost a lot of money, I really can't afford to pay, I wonder if I can participate. You don't need to worry. Dr. Jung will cover expenses that we're short on. Be careful with that. PHMG July August Ma'am, this roll is delicious. Have plenty. It's really good. So good. August September Jeez... What riled you up now? By the way, does it usually take so long to get to the trial? It can start quickly if there's enough legal grounds. I see. But this is a civil case and way too controversial. The trial may not be held. Not be held? Really? Excuse me. Is this the office for the humidifier disinfectant victims' lawsuit What happened? You said it wouldn't go to trial. An American national and her child died. If the lawsuit is handed over to the US, we may face insurmountable penalty, and at worse, O2 may go bankrupt. Why did Americans die here. This has to be dealt with here. Find a way. Yes, sir. Court Are you Dr. Jung Tae-hoon? Good day. I'm Seo Woo-sik, O2's rep of this suit. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm not sure if it's proper to shake your hands. Another time then. All rise. We'll now begin the combined trial of 2011-4725, 7945 and 8211, and the other humidifier disinfectant individual lawsuits. Plaintiff. Attorney Han Young-ju, Your Honors. Defense. Your Honors, our main chair attorney has not arrived yet. I'd be most appreciative if you could wait a moment. Here he comes. My sincere apologies for being late. The traffic was terrible. Daehan Law Firm's Jung Kyung-han and 3 co-chairs representing O2. My apologies for making you wait. Where were we? $1 million, was it? This would change things. We will now begin the trial. Plaintiff, you may begin. Your Honors, before we begin, I'd like to address the court. Yes, go ahead. Thank you. On behalf of O2, I'd like to sincerely apologize to you all for creating disturbance in your lives. But O2 is not a corporation that creates harmful products. We'd like to commission Prof. Chu Sung-mo's team, Korea's highest authority, to conduct a toxicity testing. I am in no shape disputing KCDC's finding, but we'd like to act based on the most accurate and clearest judgment. Your Honors, I'd like to formally request delaying this trial until after Prof. Chu's testing. I object, Your Honors. They're attempting to buy time by delaying this trial even though plenty of time was given prior to this date. In addition, as O2 transitions from a holding company to an LLC, they're attempting to evade their responsibilities. Aiding victims on life support is urgent and crucial. Please take that into account. A question for the defense. If O2 becomes an LLC, they can't be held accountable, no? This transition to an LLC could bring misunderstanding at current situation. But this has been in the making for a very long time. I'll submit documented liaison between O2 and headquarters in UK. In addition, O2 has put together a $5 million fund and began unconditional settlement. This is a list of victims who have settled. - Unconditional settlement? - Yes, that's correct. Very well, give us a moment to discuss. Who could've settled? I don't know who they are, but it breaks my heart. This is $100,000. Another $100,000 if you give me the list of victims. What do you take me for? Try giving me millions and see if I settle. The living must go on living. It's a good opportunity. - Defense. - Yes, Your Honors. When will the result for the toxicity test come out? We expect it to take about 3 months. We plan to rush it to minimize the impact on everyone. Since O2 is voluntarily settling with the victims, we'll allow the defense's request for proper assessment. We will continue the trial after Dr. Chu Sung-mo's team has submitted the analysis report. The court is adjourned. No! Your Honors! You can't adjourn like this! Good work. Your Honors! Please! - Great job. - You as well. There is a possibility of ill intent in this lawsuit. What do you mean by 'ill intent', could you elaborate? A beloved 17-year old product is suddenly framed as a killer. I'd like to find out why and who is attempting to drag down the reputation of an honest company after the test. Thank you for the interview. Not at all, thank you. - Have a good one. - Take care. Ms. Han! I inquired the justice department, Mr. Han Hyun-jong passed on list of victims when he settled. What did you say? I'm going to go see... And do what? He already took the money and settled. Mr. Han Hyun-jong. I thought you took a lot of money, just look at you. So you found all out and dropped by. Because of my twins... and my wife's hospital bills... I borrowed money from family and friends. These kind folks... co-signed loans... without hesitation, they're private loans... And O2 bought off my debt. Yeah... I sold off my twins... and settled. So don't come by anymore. You think we'll give up if you keep this up? No way, I'm never giving up. That's why! Stop tormenting these people, and come after me instead. This is my last warning. 8th floor, going up, doors are closing. Transition to LLC has completed as of today. And current settlement rate is at 32%. I'll raise it to 50% by the next trial date, sir. What's the plaintiff up to? They seem to be looking for an expert to take the stand. Expert? Who? Are you Dr. Jang Tae-sung? Hello, I'm Attorney Han Young-ju. For us working in chemistry, it's not an easy decision to go against O2. But you've always led social movements. Many victims are still suffering. Please help us. Very well, when can I decide by? Second trial date is next week. I was surprised by how fast we got the toxicity result. O2 made a very dangerous product. We've kept the original copy securely in the lab. Are you trying to bargain with O2? No, no, don't be mistaken. I'm just pointing out its appropriate value. Bring it. This is a 5-year exclusive agreement Research Exclusivity Agreement between O2 and your lab for all of our testings. And this is... ...an non-disclosure agreement. Regardless of the trial's outcome, if this report leaks, we will take necessary actions against you. Run your tests again. Okay. Is there another problem? It's about Jung Tae-hoon. I heard he's looking for someone in my field. Shouldn't you look into that? I better sign this next time. Sorry about that. Good morning, please take a look... Excuse me. How did it go? It'll be possible. Understood, good work. Thank you. Please read this only once for us. Who are you? Take your hands off? I thought his hose came loose. Why are you in here? Need a new pair of lungs for him? We, O2, can help you. Give me a call, I'll be waiting outside. We have to rush Min-woo's lung transplant. If we wait any longer, even that will be difficult. I'm sorry, Min-woo, I just can't agree to this. Not a lot of people today. That's their strategy. Public's indifference and short attention span. There's barely any articles nowadays. I do solemnly and truly declare that the evidence I shall give is the truth and nothing but the truth. Plaintiff, you may question the witness. Prof. Jang Tae-sung, you stated that toxicity in a chemical substance can vary depending on circumstances. How could it vary? Toxicity of a chemical is divided into oral, dermal and inhalation. So depending on person and circumstances, it will vary. Could you put it in layman's terms? For example, a chemical may not have any effect when touched, but when inhaled or swallowed, it may prove very fatal to someone. Could PHMG, the main component of Spotless, be construed as one? Yes, that's correct. It is unthinkable that a poison like PHMG was used in an inhalable product. It's as if they wanted to kill people. Metaphorically, PHMG is not just a knife, it's like a sharp scalpel. I'll submit Prof. Jang's toxicity analysis to the court. That is all. Defense, you may cross examine. Professor, as an expert in the chemistry field, you've consulted many branches of the government, correct? Yes, that's right. As a member of Ministry of Environment's Hazardous Substance Review board? - Yes, I served there. - I see. This is a reference book published by Ministry of Environment in 2000. Professor, could you read the highlighted part? This was written by you. If that is correct, please read it. Witness, please read. Polyhexamethylene guanidine is not harmful to human body. Is PHMG for polyhexamethylene guanidine? That's right. Then you are contradicting your previous statement. Were you trying to kill people with false statement back then. Back then, the reference book... Do not make statements you can't take back! That metaphorical scalpel is killing an honorable corporation! Do you understand? I object! The defense is... That is all. Isn't this worse than not having a witness? Defense, you may question the witness. Prof. Chu Sung-mo, this is your lab's inhalation toxicity report. Could you summarize? After conducting a thorough toxicity test of O2's Spotless, the researchers conclude as follows. It is impossible to prove that the humidifier's thick vapor is the cause of problems in and around pulmonary alveoli. The result of an animal testing confirms that PHMG level found inside Spotless is at a safe level for human body. Therefore, Spotless has no ties to pulmonary fibrosis. This is my lab's conclusion. So, Spotless did not cause the lung illness. Is it correct? Yes, that's correct. I'll submit Dr. Chu's report to the court as evidence. What's going on? Plaintiff, do you have any questions for the witness? Yes. Prof. Chu Sung-mo. You have contracted by O2 to conduct 5 tests a year for the past 3 years, is this true? Yes, that's right. Wouldn't you call them your employer? That sounds excessive, but I will not deny it. I'm beginning to question the integrity of your test... Objection. The plaintiff is challenging a scholarly conscience by stating a personal opinion. Sustained. Plaintiff, be careful. My apologies if I offended you. I'll rephrase that. How would you verify the validity of its fairness? We were concerned for that when we were contracted. So we needed an observer who can be impartial. I can absolutely guarantee that our test process and results are impartial and fair. So the observer is someone we can all approve? That's right. Then could you state the name of the observer? Who is he? He's sitting right there. The one who started this case, Dr. Jung Tae-hoon. - Doctor, is that true? - What's going on? Is that true? Doctor, Doctor! What's going on? What the hell is going on! Silence! Silence in the court! Could you please step forward? Are you Dr. Jung Tae-hoon? That's right. Is the witness telling the truth? I'll ask once more, is he telling the truth? Yes, it's the truth. The process was fair and the results are sound. Spotless has nothing to do with pulmonary fibrosis. Dr. Jung, what are you doing? How could you... Dr. Jung! What the hell are you talking about?! That's not true! Tell me why... It can't be! How could this happen? You'll receive a call from Dr. Chu about joining his toxicity test team. Do not waver at the result and side with O2. That's... the only way you can get what you want. We have proven that a despicable group of people are attempting to cash in on deaths of their family by putting blame on an honorable corporation. Please consider this fact during deliberation. We will announce the final verdict on 4th of next month at 11 a.m. We are adjourned. We've been backstabbed twice already. I'm barely making ends meet, you know that?! Twice! You know! Do it until the end! I'm sorry, they were adamant about keeping it a secret. What's the point now. It's all in the past now. You've seen the tests and you said it's all true. Is it really true? Yeah, that's right. We've cleared our name but it still doesn't feel right. To think that some people still believe Spotless is to blame, it saddens me to no end. Do you have any plans to sue them for damages? Well, that'd mean hurting those who have been hurt before. That goes against O2's business philosophy. Please, Sir! You can't take that! Please! Grandma, this is why you shouldn't be in debt. Ji-young... I'm so sorry... In your next life, don't get sick and live well... - Cheers! - Cheers! It's great. The reaction to your interview is great. Win or lose, O2 sympathizes. Congratulations, sir. Congratulations! This is all thanks to you. I have one more thing to announce, the headquarters has promoted me as O2's Head of Asian Operations. One more cause for celebration. Once again, congrats. Thank you, thank you. Then will Mr. Seo take over as Korea's CEO? Yes, as of today, CEO Seo will take over. - Congratulations! - Congrats! - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. - Woo-sik. - Yes, sir How much Spotless stock do we still have? About $30 million worth, sir. I'll have them destroyed. Are you nuts? That'd be a waste. Push it out within a month. Put them back on the market? Got a problem with that? What if more people die... Don't worry, people don't die so easily. And what if some do. We got those idiots for that. Get rid of them in a month, swap out components and sell it as a new product. Then this problem will be buried for good. Right away, sir. Have a drink. You did good. Thank you. Freaking morons... I really love this country. If you got money, everyone will bow. Did you know? I'm a British citizen. Yes, I knew. That's why I don't care if Koreans die or not. I'm just here to make money. Does it offend you because you're a Korean? Not at all, sir. Come to Malaysia after the stock's gone, let's play golf. Sure. Head back in. International Airport Are you O2's CEO Cho? Yes, who are you? Police. Please come with us. Can't you see this? I got a flight to catch. You're on the no-fly list as of today. What? CEO Seo Woo-sik Sir, we got a big problem. You should turn on the news. All right, leave me. It has been uncovered that the toxicity report of O2's humidifier disinfectant was fabricated. According to a video released by Hankook Hospital's Dr. Jung Tae-hoon, Dr. Chu Sung-mo's team manipulated the test environment, and attempted to cover up the real test results. The government convenes a meeting with relevant ministries. The prosecution has put O2's CEO Cho Sun-woo on no-fly list, and plans to bring him in for a full investigation. As soon as additional news comes in... I'm Min-ji's dad, Seo Woo-sik. Need a new pair of lungs for him? We, O2, can help you. Honey, my necktie. Got any ironed shirts? I'm sorry, honey. You said it's an important meeting, right. Min-ji kept you up all night? Take her to a general hospital instead of a local clinic. Yeah, I made an appointment. Good. I have got to buy her a present now that she filled it up? Min-ji's Reward Stickers What did she want? Walkie-talkie, she wanted to play with you. Right, walkie-talkie, I'll buy it over lunch. Let me see her for a bit before heading out. No, she fell asleep just now. Just for a bit. Thank you. See you tomorrow. O2 This is Seo Woo-sik. It's an acute pulmonary fibrosis. We found it early, so with treatment, her daily life won't be affected much. What about my daughter? Where's Min-ji now? No! No! Min-ji! No! Please! Min-ji... She died because of me. No, God loved her so much, He took her away early. - I don't want to hear it! - Honey, please! - I'm going to be with her! - Ma'am, please calm down. Honey, please! No! I'd like to take a break. Sure, you went through an ordeal. But do me this favor. It's about Spotless' Australian export. Could you finish that up? Those idiots will only talk to you. Can you do that? Yes, I'll get it done. Thank you. I apologize that our company cannot proceed Sender: Jung Tae-hoon with the import contract for O2 humidifier sterilizers. The Australian health authority has not authorized the product. By the way is it true that Koreans use this? I cannot believe that. It can cause death Min-ji's dad. Yes. I'm Min-ji's dad, Seo Woo-sik. They are the devil. They will sacrifice people to make money. Those devils are always prepared to take on anything. As you know, there aren't any legal hurdles for production and sale of the disinfectant. But it's a different story when they're willingly selling a dangerous product. Thank you for coming. Say hello, this is Dr. Chu Sung-mo. Good to meet you. We're on the same side now. There was only one way to win this fight from the beginning. Let the world know of their real crime ourselves. This should not go to civil trial. This is a crime of murder. I was acquitted thanks to you, thank you so much. It's the truth, no need to be thankful. I have one good news, and one bad news, which would you like first? Let's start with the good news? My boy Min-woo will receive a legal lung transplant. That's incredible, congratulations. Thank you. What's the bad news... An attorney was assigned to you... We've met before. I'm Min-woo's aunt, I'll do my best. This is indeed a terrible news? What did you say? - One moment. - Sure. I'm so happy for you. Yes, Chief Prosecutor. Right now? I think you should find another lawyer. Don't you worry. It doesn't matter who takes this case. I got the home court advantage here. Why are you in here? You didn't get the memo. Chief Prosecutor Lim reinstated me. What? He said I was perfect for taking out the trash and British thug. Trash and British thug? Han Young-ju, watch your mouth! You punk! Watch your damn tone? Shall we sit down first. Let's see... This is pretty simple? You knowingly sold a toxic product, then fabricated evidence when caught. It's murder, anything to say? Han, you crossed the line big time. Wait! Don't drink that! It's got Spotless' undiluted solution. What the hell are you doing! He could die drinking that! Call the ambulance. Now! He's not going to die. O2 doesn't make products like that. Environment-friendly, non-toxic, O2's cool! Am I right, Mr. Cho? Was that really Spotless? It's spring water from the hallway. That moron. Han Gil-ju Have you been well? I miss you... more than ever today. Han Gil-ju Mom... Mom... Mom... I'm hungry. It's been 10 years since the humidifier disinfectant scandal. A bipartisan committee has been formed by the government to uncover the truth behind this deadly incident. We'll now begin the first fact-finding committee of humidifier disinfectant. We've invited victims and their families here at the congress. We're also joined by Dr. Jung Tae-hoon, who first brought this issue to the world as the nominated representative of the victims. As listed on the order, we will first watch a video of the victims' testimonies. At first... the hospital said it was a common cold. They said my home shouldn't be dry and recommended to use the humidifier, so I used the humidifier with the disinfectant. The TV said I should use it, and the government certified it, so of course I thought it was safe. I'm a murderer. I used a disinfectant that was not necessary, and killed my wife and children. Since the company that sold it and the government that authorized it said they are innocent, I'm the one who killed them. I can't remember my mom's face anymore. I woke up from sleep, and couldn't walk anymore. Why did this happen to me? Why did my mom die? Whose fault was it? I miss you, mom. Technology and Standards Agency, what did you feel when watching that video? A lot more people have suffered because of your certification. We, Technology and Standards Agency, are not responsible for this. You're not responsible? We certified it in accordance with the law and regulation, so the safety certification itself is not the problem. They got it certified as a detergent but sold it as a disinfectant, how is that not a problem? That would be Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). This wasn't the fault of MFDS. MFDS is not at fault either? We deal with products that can be touched or eaten. Ministry of Environment is to blame. They're responsible for toxic substance. It wasn't us. As per Toxic Substance Control Law, our job ends when we take the report. Ministry of Health and Welfare is responsible. What did you say, woman? - Did I hear that right? - How long have you served? All right, enough, let's all stop and go for lunch, okay? We did more than enough. Let's take a photo. You are all incredible. How are you all so high and almighty? You people allowed it to be sold. And innocent people have died! How could no one take responsibility for it? Are you really civil servants? Isn't it your job to protect the public?! What are you doing! Punish for murder! Save my family! Punish for murder! Save my family! Punish for murder! Save my family! Punish for murder! We're here! We're the proof! According to a thesis from Korean Society of Environmental Health, over 950,000 people have suffered health problems due to this incident and 20,000 people have died. We must all remember, have we used humidifiers? If so have we applied disinfectant? Over 10 million bottles were sold between 1994 and 2011 That's enough to expose over half of South Korea's total population. Kim Sang-kyung Lee Sun-bin Yoon Kyung-ho Seo Young-hee
