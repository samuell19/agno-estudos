What you can expect if you want to get outdoors and take advantage of some things today, today might not be the best day. Red flag warning for extreme fire danger due to gusty north winds and extremely dry conditions. It will not take much to spark a fire today. And once one is sparked, it will spread rapidly due to the strong winds. Meanwhile, satellite and radar, we're not going to see any clouds overhead for today. Sunny skies expected. That's right, PG&amp;E says it will decide within the next hour if it's going to be shutting off power preemptively anywhere in the north state. Already. We've just learned that firefighters in Butte County are working on a fire in the Feather River Canyon. Now, it's burning about ten acres so far. It just broke out a few minutes ago. This is in the Camp Creek Road area. And looking it up on the map, this is just northeast of the Pulga area. Honey, there's, there's all kinds of stuff falling out of the sky. Fire rescue. What is the address of the emergency? I don't have an address. I'm in Chico on the Skyway, headed up to Paradise. Should I turn around, or? There's nothing going on in Paradise. We do have a fire in the Jarbo Gap area. So once we get the Forest Service resources coming down from... Fire rescue. What is the address of the emergency? I want you to go ahead and evacuate immediately. We do have the fire department in the area, okay? I've got one involved structure, two others imminent involvement. All units be advised, the town of Paradise is under mandatory evacuation. The town of Paradise is under mandatory evacuation. Mandatory evacuation! Mandatory evacuation! Lord, pray for our house. Please pray for us. Please, we need your help, Lord. Nope. Lori? Time to abandon ship. Ordering an evacuation order now due to the fire for areas of Pentz Road in Paradise. Bye, house. Through Highway 70. Last check, the fire over 1,000 acres. KPBY News Time. It's 8:42. Oh my God. The fire is at the hospital. The hospital is right here on the left. My wife was, uh, she was in her surgery. Okay. She was still doing surgery when they were in there. What? It's everywhere. We are 100% surrounded by fire. 14, go ahead. Got a little bit of a firestorm. We have fires threatening all around all of the buildings, to include near a gas tank and an oxygen. It's 11:38 in the morning in Paradise, and this is what it looks like. Oh my God. Oh my God. How? Like, we can't hardly breathe. We have to get out of here. Do you have something to report? I need an ambulance immediately, emergency to my grandfather's house. He's in a wheelchair. We need him evacuated now! Can you guys get him out with, without assistance? I, I don't have a lot of resources to send. No... Evacuate on foot! Evacuate on foot! Get out of your cars! We're in a bad spot. The window is so hot. I can't even touch the window right now. There's, like, explosions everywhere. Oh my God, people's tires are popping. - Holy shit, dude. - Just be safe. Fly, fly, fly! Fly, dude. I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared. All these buildings are gone. All these homes are gone. My hometown has burned today. Uh oh. I can't see. So why aren't the firefighters up here? They're, this, I think, Bud how can they be everywhere? Holy moly. That's Laura's house. Yep. That's Laura's house. Are we going to make it alive to Chico? Oh, hold on. Hold on. Look, there's clear sky! There's clear sky! There's clear sky! Hey, clear sky, guys! Clear sky, guys. The sky. - All right, guys. - Clear sky. All right. Okay. We made it through it, guys. Made it through. I just have to check on Sweetheart and Granddad, but we're, we're through guys. We are through. Can we get away, far away from away from Paradise? Yep, we are. Is in Paradise, what was Paradise, where one fire official says everything is destroyed. In Paradise, about two hours north of Sacramento, after the Camp Fire just exploded here early yesterday morning, prompting a massive evacuation. The inferno exploding in size from 200 acres to 18,000 in a matter of hours. Its dramatic growth. Terrifying speed. We have now learned that at least five people died while trapped in their cars trying to escape that fire in Paradise, California. Um, that one is called the Camp Fire, burning in that part of the state. This is a community of about 27,000 people, and it is completely paralyzed. It's going to be weeks before residents are allowed back in. And that's just to go through the rubble. Who knows when people will actually be allowed to live here again. In the meantime, you can see this is one of the neighborhoods that has been completely decimated by... God. Oh my God, look at this. This is the devastation, it's still recording. This is why there not putting people in. This is the reason why. Yeah, because there's a lot of hazards in the area. So, we can't go down every road, but we can give you what we have. Oh, God. I wasn't born and raised here, but I've been here since 1981. I arrived here on a Greyhound bus. I was the town drunk and living in a camper shell in a guy's backyard. Oh, we were hoping that we weren't going to have to see that, Ridgeview High School is gone. I sobered up in 1984. I became an elected official in 2004, then I became the mayor. I went from being the town drunk to being the town mayor. And I met my wife here. This is a place where everything came together for me. And within a day, it was gone. You know, I'm grateful that I'm alive, but I'm 74 years old. Change is difficult. I'm going to die here. You know, not in Chico. I'm not going to go back down to the Bay Area where I was raised. This is my home. - Oh, look at this. - This is what's so crazy. All this burnt, these homes are here. How crazy is this? Yeah. See that? - He's stuck here, huh? - Is that a real deer? Yeah, that's a real deer. Hey, buddy. Things have changed, indefinitely. Just everything is... Decimated. My wife and I, we loved living here. And my boys, they were born in Paradise. Their whole world was Paradise. That is all they ever knew. Where we lived can't really be replaced. When you realized that everything was burning, you just basically, kind of come to terms with, there's a lot of things that could go wrong. During the evacuations, there was a gentleman who came up to me and he said, “My family is trying to get out of town going down Circle Drive.” And I was like, “They need to not go that way.” But there was no cell service. In the morning, I went down there and sure enough did find a, uh, vehicle that had burned and looked for any remains that may have been around there, but didn't find anything. A little bit later I saw a lady. She talked about going down Circle Drive and her vehicle catching on fire, and her son being there and getting her out of there. And she had burns up her arms. And, uh, I knew it was her, so. I went and gave her a hug, because I had been looking for her body. So... I'm sorry. We've been getting a lot of phone calls and emails about people who are still missing. Nearly 1,300 still unaccounted for. The search for the missing happening in shelters. It is my sad duty to report, we now can confirm a total of 9 fatalities. We're learning that the death toll now stands at staggering 23. 48 people are now confirmed dead in the states... The fire killed at last 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, including homes and businesses. The whole town is gone. I, I still don't know how to process that. We were pretty sure our house burned down. And this is basically what we got. So, yeah, this is our area. This is, um, our beds. It's not much, but we have what we have. So... How's that, good? After they come here, people think that they're going to have their house back the way, it was, they're going to have their furniture back the way it was, that they're going to have life before fire and they're not going to. 060. We are in the midst of a catastrophe. The state of California, uh, will do everything we can. And we need to, I think, make sure we are prepared. But what, what we just saw, we just left Pleasure. - Paradise. - Or Paradise. And what we just saw at, at Paradise is just, you know, it's just not acceptable. There's been such an outpouring of help and support and food, people bringing coats and umbrellas. And, and all those things are so helpful. But at the end of the day, I have nowhere to go. As hard as it to say, I don't see the town coming back. I just don't. We have two bags worth of my children's clothes, that were in their dressers. And the clothes that are on our back. And we got in our car and we left. It's crazy. I never thought I would be a part of a, a natural disaster. And I was so hurt and sad for the people like in New Orleans on the Hurricane Katrina, but it doesn't really hit you until you actually affects you and hits your backyard. My wife's been in Paradise all her life. Her parents has been up there since they were children. Our families were affected by the situation, too. We don't have grandmas and grandpas that we can go to. I, honestly, I want to get the hell out of here, but we have nowhere to go. I'm getting really anxious to want to know what's still standing. Paradise Police Chief announced that plans would begin for the residents to reenter into the town of Paradise. For many people, it's been more than 30 days since they last saw their homes standing in the city of Paradise. Have you been up here yet? No, this is my first time. I lost my house, too and I'll tell you what, it's not easy. No, it's not. But we're alive. Yeah, we are. And what, what's important, we still have it, right? Yeah. Back there, this is all ours, and you can see the buildings that burnt. And that's where all the buses burnt. School garden over here. Yeah, all of our garden. In our district we have nine schools. And eight of the nine are damaged. And four are destroyed. That was the fifth grade wing. All the planning we've done, still we never thought it would be this bad. Yep. Okay, it's so hard to walk down here. Don't touch any of this, it's asbestos. If the school doesn't go back, there will be no town. And part of the problem is‐is, there's nobody up here to come back to. A little sun that I made for my mom when, I think, I was in preschool. This is his transmission, so made of, like, a really low‐grade aluminum. Some, just as light as it can be. It's pieces of gravel. I mean, it really just goes to show how hot the fire was. Isn't that your bed‐frame? Yeah, that's my bed‐frame. That's my old gas tank. I mean it's just piecing stuff back together. Trying to figure out like, what happened up here. If I still had a house, if they still had a house, you know. - No, I already knew. - Yeah, so... As soon as I left my house, I was like, “I'm not coming back to this.” I watched mine burn. Even though I lost my house, I have all the stuff that survived, all the memories, because I wasn't able to find my parent's wedding album, I found all of my baby pictures and my brother, for my mom. Some one‐of‐a‐kind pictures that don't exist anywhere. I left almost way too late. I'd say about ten minutes later, the fire would have been right there, just down the street, and I might not have been able to get out. I was running back and forth through the house to grab everything that I possibly could. As the propane tanks were just getting louder and louder. That's when we knew we had to go. I drove out of the fire with almost no gas, I had my dog up in front and I saw the blacked‐out sky with, like, the red on the horizon. This entire area was on fire and no one could really do anything. The, the reality is‐is that it was November 8th and we hadn't had any kind of significant rain. It had always rained before trick or treating, right? - Right. Right. - You know what I mean? And now, and now we're in these patterns here where we don't see rain until, you know, end of November. That morning, the wind cranked up. And you know, you're kind of waiting, like, what's coming next? In this particular case, it was a fire eight miles away, throwing up a column full of embers and ash. The darkest, blackest column of smoke I've ever seen. And then a 40‐mile‐an‐hour wind taking that over the top of Paradise in perfect alignment, and dropping it on the town of Paradise. And so it really was the perfect storm. We lost a hundred and some thousand acres of land. There was multiple fires burning for at least a week? Probably more. We just tried to save what we could save. And help people along that way. That's about all we could do. It didn't matter if we had 1,000 fire engines lined up on the ridge that day. This was going to happen. Everything lined up perfectly that day for this to happen. Things are changing. Firefighters are living climate change, they're, it's staring them in the face every day. It's not that California hasn't had bad fires and horrible conditions over time, but they're lasting longer and they're becoming more extreme. Going into the Camp Fire in Paradise, we had 5 years of a drought that we hadn't recovered from. When you see temperatures increase, literally one degree in temperature change, changes what's growing on the landscape, or what isn't growing. November 8th, 2018 from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. High fire danger are forecasted in... PG&amp;E had alerted the Paradise area the power would be shut off as a preventative thing. It was not. And then we had a fire. We have confirmed PG&amp;E experienced a problem minutes before the blaze broke out. An electrical transmission line near the site of the massive fire was causing sparks. And it's no real secret that the equipment we're looking at was built, I believe it was 1921. I want to write a formal letter to the PG&amp;E board of directors. I should make these into thank you cards and make one for each one of them. I just wanted to show them and say, hey, here's my house. That's my home on November 10th, you know? Where are you sleeping tonight? If somebody from PG&amp;E was over my shoulder, what is it that you would want to say to them? I was born in Paradise. I have lived there my whole life. So that's a really big deal. But I want them to know really how hard it is. It's not just that I lost my house. It's not that I lost my memories or anything like that. It's that they, it was my entire way of life. Not just a portion of it. It was literally every single moment of my life and how I did stuff and how my daughter did stuff that is completely gone. After the fire, I went back and digging through our place. This is all the stuff that survived the fire. My John Wayne shot glass, I probably had 70 different unique shot glasses. And only one survived, and it was John Wayne, which makes me happy, because I just think that he should have been the one to survive. I miss my family. And I miss my home. My entire family lived in Paradise. 34 people. Aunts, uncles, cousins. Brothers, mom, dad, grandparents. Every single one of them lost their home. We rented and we did not have renter's insurance. There's no rental anywhere because all of Butte County was filled right after the fire. I knew I had to get back to work, and so a trailer seemed like it was going to be the best option. So I just went and took out a loan. It's more expensive for me to live in this tiny box than it was for me to live in a two‐bedroom, two‐bath house. I'm done with California. If it wasn't for Kayla and her family, we'd probably be gone. There's temporary facilities in Texas and Mexico. Right. People need a place to live. And probably there will be a significant number of people who don't rebuild in Paradise. You know, it's hard not to take it personally, right? Because I represent the community and I know the people that have been effected. In my district right now, with the Camp Fire 50,000 people have been displaced. And you know, one of the most immediate things is how do we get housing delivered as expeditiously as possible? You know, don't we have a responsibility to just sort of stop building if it's going to be in areas that are not defensible? Is there a point at which we say, “You know what, these areas are just going to be off limits to development, because it's just going to be too dangerous?” Have you thought about that? Should we deprioritize places that have earthquake risk? Should we deprioritize places that have flood risk? Uh, we're going to start running out of places that we can build in this state. Understand this about Paradise, the overwhelming majority of people moved there because they wanted to, not because they had to. If you know this community, it has a very strong sense of place and it's been there for over 100 years. Its heritage was, you know, Gold Rush days. It really is a, a pioneering spirit. I can remember when I was young. No restrictions to speak of. No ordinances. No laws. It was a great contributor to moving people to Paradise. It was always surprising to learn that Paradise was a city of 26,500, because it never felt like that. Ever. It was like quintessential small‐town America. It's kind of the other part of California you never knew was here. Some of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. Anything that's a lifetime first, I did in Paradise. Yummy! Where we lived, it was a good spot. I could hear the school bell ring and then it was time to go to class. On the weekends, there was the little league softball fields. You could hear the crack of the bat and parents cheering and stuff like that. Who do you see in there? Mommy! Hi, Mom! Hi. There's no place like Paradise. That'll always be home to me. You can't replace that. I lived there for 30 years and I love that town. And I'm not going to bail on it now. I'm not going to bail on it. Tom are we set up for people at the bus stops on Monday? We will be. Okay. Two people for each bus. Okay, well we'll be here too, in the morning and then... Are you going over there in the morning? Yeah, I'll be there too, in the morning. Okay, alright. Um. What a mess. We haven't eaten. Well, that's not very intelligent. There are some things that take priority. Over food? And health? No, because if you're not healthy and you don't eat, then you can't do your job. You know, in combat, I learned that if you don't feed yourself and take care of your men, and you don't feed them, then you can't fight. Well you can't fight if you don't take care of yourself. We're going to fight! We are renting sites for kids that are displaced. So we rented mall space. No I prefer not to bring them down the hill. We're asking our fellow schools if they have any extra classrooms. This is little Durham Elementary. They've been so nice to take us in. There's too many kids depending on their schools and their teachers and the friends they have, to just let everybody scatter. Hi! How are you? I'm doing good! I haven't seen you in a while. Oh, I know. Because we haven't been together, huh? You okay? Yeah. Okay. So how do you guys like this, versus being at the mall or in a classroom? Well, I happen to like being in class. I know you do. You always have. Well, where do you guys want to go to school after this? I kind of want to stay in Evergreen. Because, like, Evergreen is my school. You know there's no Evergreen right now. Yeah. I'm going to find you another place. So let's try this now. Yeah, let's see if this one work. There you go! Bingo. It's getting me cold. How many 6th graders do you have? Actually showing up? Our, our biggest day was 33. Today we have 24. So, um, that's, that's roughly a third of, of the 6th Grade population. Where are they, because we're missing like 1,000 kids right now that we haven't found. - It's crazy. - Yeah. It is. It is. Parents who are saying, “I need some normalcy for my kids, I'm going to put them in another district or something,” without students, or teachers and our classified and food service and custodians and bus drivers and everybody. Nobody will have jobs. We just can't ever let up right now. Come on! I need to think about what's best for my kids. And right now is to find a place and go back up to Paradise. Arabella do you have anything to say about Paradise? You don't have anything to say about Paradise? All of the evacuation orders were lifted in Paradise. People are starting to return. Most are in trailers thanks to an ordinance passed by the town. She's been living in her car. She will have a place to call home finally. The kids, a lot of them are in trailers. A lot of them are doubled up, tripled up, you know, living with family members, nine people to a room. Um, they're, they're struggling. This is not a typical high school thing, to lose your town and to not have a place to live, or to worry about their friends moving. What kind of things can you do to try to release that anxiety? I listen to music. Um, and I'm trying to share with people so they know they're not alone in this world. Exactly. They're not the only ones that lost their mother. They're not the only ones that lost their house. They're not the only ones that lost something in their life. They're not... For me, right now, it's just brand new, like, what to do, how to support my kids. They're amazing, but it's also, you know, shows you what, how hard this really is for everybody. I work with some kids on trauma counseling, which has been tough for me, since I almost died in the fire myself. Um, so it's kind of hard not to get triggered. November 8th, I got in my car and started driving. And we go into this black cloud. And then the flames were everywhere. I'm worried that the engine is going to explode. I'm dead‐stopped and I can't go right or left because the flames are on both sides, and I can't go back. I try to call my mom to say goodbye, because I thought this is it. Yeah. Thank you, Paradise Ice, for giving us a place to come out. And please do not drink the water out of the water fountain. The water is not safe yet. They have free bottled water. Tell me a little bit about putting on this event. Why'd you do it? Well, I can't take full credit for pretty much any of it. Um, the thought of doing a tree lighting ceremony was tossed out there. We saw that the skating rink was still intact. The tree was donated. And everybody knew somebody and pulled it together. Hi. How are you guys doing? Oh, good, it's great to see all these faces. I know, huh? Isn't it nice? It's like, oh, let's just get back, let's have our... These are our people. Hi, little puppy. - I'm glad you came. - Yeah. It's awesome seeing people here. I just came to say thank you to you man, you guys did a wonderful job. Thank you. I appreciate that. They haven't been able to see their dad very much. He's been working so hard and being so brave, but I wish he was able to have a little more time with us. Because we need him right now. Like, emotionally. And the boys, this is a big deal for them. It's going to change their life, and we have to lean on each other. My two boys, they've been my crutches through this whole thing. - Hello. - Hey. So, I can't do two things at once. Do you want to light the tree with Easton? Sure. Like, when they count down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, just plug it in? - Yeah. - I'll show you where. Easton, did he get his shoes back on? I took his skates off. Okay. Alright. Here you go, dude. Thank you for coming. And what a great time to be here. It's so fun to see people. And I don't know, I don't shake hands much anymore. It seems like we hug each other more than anything else. This tree, it's small now, but it's going to grow with us and get stronger and taller as we get stronger and taller as a, as a community, right? So, if you'd help me, 5. 4, 3, 2, 1. Wooo! Thanks very much. It's a beautiful tree. A new set of problems arising for Camp Fire victims in Paradise. FEMA now says that fire debris must be removed before a property can be reoccupied. Paradise residents living on their destroyed properties are getting word they'll have to leave. If we do not do this FEMA will not pay for the debris removal. This is BS. This whole thing. We are struggling to come out of a very, very bad situation. I lost my wife. I lost everything else. I just got back my property. This is too much. I, I can't do it. I'm going to just leave Paradise. I'm sorry. We have a financial gun to our head. I hate making this decision. - Don't do it. - Don't do it. If we don't do it, our town will look like a warzone for the next 20 years, because we are broke. We're relying on others to help us and those resources... My house burned down in the fire. And I'm here because we just want to build back as quickly as we can. I've got my lot cleared. I've got clearance. I've got my plans drawn. I want to get a permit and dig footings and begin and we can't. There's big delays. Let's back up a little bit and recognize that Paradise, in a good year, built about eight homes. Now we're looking at about 800 a year, right? So that is an action that's not going to happen tomorrow. But again, Melissa, you're missing the point. A lot of people are not coming back because on top of losing everything we own, it's becoming onerous to deal with the town to get anything done. So you're the council members, so you guys take control of this town and direct the staff to do what we, the citizens, need to do to save our town. Hi, Looter. Well, come here. - Her name's Looter. - Looter. No, come here. We, um, found her with a guy who we'd arrested for looting, like, three times. And she just kind of stayed here. We, it was like our therapy dog. Then there was the issue of, well, when that guy gets out of jail, what are we going to do? It turns out it's not his dog. She's basically, uh, owned by the police department now. When I first came here, I noticed the door was ajar, and you, someone kicked it in. Can you tell what, uh, has been missing, or? Yeah. They've taken lot of tools that I had in there. This thing doesn't burn, but my house walls completely burned down. And then this happens. Yeah. The job has completely changed. People are frustrated. Let me get you the case number. Okay. Trying to maintain control over what, what little is left. A lot of people have left and are leaving. The hospital is gone. Most of the doctors are somewhere else. The elementary school is gone. It's where my kids went to school. I know it's cliché, but the donut shop was right back there. It's not the same Paradise that existed pre‐fire. Most people up in Paradise right now are just there for the construction, the cleanup effort. There are dump trucks everywhere. PG&amp;E's board of directors voted tonight to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. For the utility's 16 million customers, experts warn rates could go up in the wake of destructive fires, and now bankruptcy. If I was the spark that started this fire, I would be responsible. PG&amp;E's not being held responsible. In fact, we're being held responsible, and all of California, it's not just us. We're being held responsible. You burned our town to a crisp. You've raised our rates. We've lost everything. And we're paying for you to ... up. How is that right? I'm Joe Earley. Like many of you, my home and business were lost in this devastating wildfire. I'm Erin Brockovich. For 27 years, I have been dealing with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric across California. And this company has been a runaway monopoly in this state for a very, very long time. I've seen them blow up San Bruno. I've seen them burn down a good portion of this state. I've seen them devastate your town. I worked for PG&amp;E when I was 18 years old. They did not care about maintenance. It was about the dividend. And that's how that company's been since 1972 when I worked there. So when you want to get angry, get angry. We need to show these bastards that we mean business. They destroyed one of the most historic towns in California. And we need to hold them accountable. We've lost everything. And how do you put a price on that kind of trauma that you live through day in and day out? As a team, we have to make them pay for everything. Because it's going to happen again if we don't. So Tammy, I hope that all the losses put together will effect some meaningful change, so that no lawyer ever has to sit across a desk with someone who suffered what you suffered. They had an opportunity to do something, and PG&amp;E chose not to do anything, and murdered my father. And that's how I feel. After Mom's death three months before, he promised he wasn't going anywhere, because we needed him. And, oh, gosh, for him to die the way he did was just, I could not think of a worse nightmare to be in. We thought Dad had died in the house. But when they finally let us go back out there, to see his wheelchair at the bottom of his garden, absolutely broke me. He was trying to, to get away. I don't sleep because that's when the real nightmares take over. Welcome. Today we're remembering and we're celebrating the lives of the 85 people who died in the Camp Fire. We are a broad and diverse group of powerful decision‐makers/implementers. And I think that's the theme today, is let's get closer to making a plan for restoration, reforestation, whatever that looks like. - It's always burned. - It's always burned. And that's something we need to look at. Maybe we need to plant the trees that can withstand fires. Trees that were here then, but have now kind of vanished. Yeah, well, I think just looking at the scale of the problem, which is the whole West Coast. If we can do larger‐scale projects like burning, you know, on these big, brush‐covered slopes. That's still the only tool we've really got that's cost‐effective. But we can't really vegetation manage our way out of the problem. Humans alter the landscape in ways that make it more flammable. None of this stuff really happens in a vacuum, there's this um, history of land management going back thousands of years. It really affects what is growing there now and why the fire burns like it does now. In the late 1800's, the timber barons got to California before the Forest Service did, and they bought all of the primo timber ground. A lot of logging happened. They didn't replant. That initiated changes in the forest structure. So, because of that, California has got these regulations that after logging you have to plant a certain number of trees per acre. So, it creates this perfect landscape for this kind of hopscotching fire behavior, where if you have a fire that starts here with the wind blowing on it, it runs like it's a grass. All that leads us toward where we are now. That's why the Camp Fire ran nine miles in the first day. It was just perfect conditions for it. We've created this. So this is the access route for, for the flumes that's how loggers used to get their timber down from the mountain. Basically, it goes from the top, uh, where the Head Dam is, all the way down. And the Head Dam is, like, this old dam that was built so many years ago, so... It's hard to communicate in words what this town was like before. You have the mountains where you, you know, a bunch of friends spend a lot of time. We have the flumes. Like, just super great places to swim. There's really, really no other place I'd rather grow up. It used to be a lot more beautiful. Yeah, it used to be. For us, this is a little bit underwhelming. Yeah. I remember, right before the fire, Burke and I went down to the flumes had a lot of fun, and it's the small stuff you miss, I guess. And then, you know, my town's gone. A lot of my friends are gone now. I feel like I got robbed of my senior year. And now we don't graduate, on the Paradise High School field, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't show up. I know a lot of my friends wouldn't either. The high school only had one wing that was burned, but there is no water, electricity. The seniors said, “We want to graduate on Om Wraith Field, like we always do.” But we're being told that it's not safe, because of the burned trees all around the field. Okay, guys. Let's do it. So. Trees. We have about 1,000 trees to take down. So who's doing it on the grounds of the public library? On the grounds of Town Hall? They're going through the whole process, because they want to be reimbursed by FEMA. Here's the issue. We don't have the timeline to follow that and still graduate. Seriously, what do we do? Well, it's official tonight, Cal Fire has concluded that PG&amp;E is responsible for causing the deadliest fire in California History. Rebuilding trust and the community are what victims hope for. So, at this tim we're going to move on to the presentation by Aaron Johnson from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric on their future energy plans for the town of Paradise. Um, thank you for having me. I'm going to admit to being a little bit nervous. So as I stand in front of you here tonight, on behalf of my company, I want to apologize for the role our equipment had in this tragedy. We know we have a lot of work to do to strengthen our electrical system. We are taking that on with more inspections and repairs of our equipment, hardening the grid, and we will be undergrounding the entire electrical distribution system for the town. It will take us, we estimate five years to fully restore your communities. With the undergrounding we're talking about, will that be part of a rate raise to pay for all that? Who's going to pay for all of that? You didn't need to cut down my trees and kill the value of my property, because you're going to underground the power lines. Now that you've decided that you're at fault. Get your checkbook out and I'd love to see a check from you. I think you missed a group. 85 people died here and we really want to hear that apology to the families of those 85 people. Our hearts go out to those that lost loved ones. They have my apology as well on behalf of this company. On behalf of this company, and we'll be here for the long haul to do right by this community and fix what we can. I've never been in a situation like this, I can't tell you... I think they should have to come live here and see what people are going through. You know, they can take all this fricking dirt and burned up cars way, but you're still left behind with broken people. The absolute crippling effect this has had on all of us. That our lives will never ever be the same because of this. You ready? Let's go, let's go, come on. My home doesn't necessarily feel like home anymore. Can you sit? Good girl. I don't have neighbors anymore. Let's go, let's go. My house made it from the fire. A lot of people don't want to live up here. The devastation is hard to live with every day. When the fire tore through Paradise, let me just paint this picture for you, it burned all the cars, the lawnmowers, the heavy equipment, the vehicles, the buildings. Uh, and it released a long list of toxic chemicals in the emissions. At the top of the list is benzene. It's a chemical that was released when, uh, the town's plastic water pipes burned. And government agencies warn that drinking water that's been contaminated with benzene can cause cancer. So, you can't even heat the water to wash. You can't take a hot shower. Exactly. Paradise water, at one time, was like the second‐cleanest water in the state. And now it may not be drinkable for up to three years. I want a baby. And my boyfriend and I are kind of in that place where we're ready. But I saw, you know, a doctor, and they're like, “You should not be having a child while you're living in that environment, because there's benzene in the water.” I'm taking showers in the benzene. Um, it absorbs through your skin. And so it's like, I had to put off that idea for a while, or I have to move, and there's nowhere to move. We've seen this happen in one other district in California, which was Santa Rosa. And to clear the 350 water lines from Santa Rosa, it took them eleven months. So we are developing... Well, hold on Kevin. So, if it took Santa Rosa eleven months to clear 350 lines and you have. - 10,500. - 10,500. At that rate, it would take about 25 years. So those are things I just didn't foresee and that are starting to make me realize how big of a disaster it really was. It's just a lot right now. It's, It's getting harder. For some, I thought it would get easier as time went on, but it's actually getting harder somehow, um, which I didn't anticipate. This one is my fish, and then the other fish is Pearl's. And then Mommy and Daddy has the birds. We love our pets. But they keep on getting dead. We have to keep on flushing them down the toilet. It's hard. This disaster has really affected everybody. Me and Marcus have had a struggle. There's times that we've broken up, you know? But we tend to get back together for the sake of the kids. The day of the fire, Phil said, “We're going to Roni's.” And I remember saying, “What?” And he goes, “They called us.” And I went... Oh, on the way home from the fire? Yeah. And I went, “Oh my God.” You know, we really didn't see each other for almost 20 years. This whole tragedy kind of, um, brought our family together. Not that we want the fire to happen, but that would have never have happened. People are weird. I don't know why we ever let that happen. You know we're here because we can't live in our own home, but we were lucky and it didn't burn. And we are blessed, we're with you guys. I mean, I know people that are living with total strangers. And you guys are so sweet and kind to take care of us. Those first few days when I was working around the clock. And they'd have, they'd have a vodka tonic ready for me. I just... I think now you guys have realized that you have to start thinking about yourselves. And, and you've been thinking about the community, the school. We just haven't had the time. But one day. It's, you guys. It's taking its toll. He's up all hours of the night. The, the PTSD is backing off a wee bit. Because it, you know, I have, I have it from the old days from the Army. And now it gets re‐exacerbated by where you get your nightmares mixed up, you know. It's like, wait a minute, that's a nightmare from the old days. But I, I'm getting, every day is better. Especially cause of you guys. You can show me. 10‐98. Report taken. I don't know which is worse having your home be completely gone or still have a house that's just in the middle of all this. And every day I want to go to work I have to drive up Skyway. There are somedays where it's just cloudy over Paradise that, uh, it just gives me cold sweat, chills. Because it does still feel like it was yesterday. I watched all this start to burn. Burn closer and closer to my house and I'm like, “well,” so yeah, I literally watched my house burn down. Paradise, the fire has reached Eagleton. My house is on fire right now. Keep traffic flowing and personnel safety. Copy. 10‐4. Oh God. God, God. We're moving. I love Paradise. So I'm kind of excited to be back in my town. How's it coming? It will be cheaper, which will be really nice, because then we could start saving more money to put away for a piece of property, which is our ultimate goal. I'm going to get my sculpture. - Oh no. - It's so cool! It could stay right there. No. It's really, it's really not. We could get a gnome and they could be friends! No, no. Yeah! Look at him. Where on Earth, did you get that? He's so cute! No. It's just, my dad got it for me in Paradise. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to the 2019 Gold Nugget Days event. Welcome home!

And the trees will start being removed next week. So we are very, very lucky. And we are having graduation. And we have some really kind of important speakers coming. ♪ ♪ Hey, Adam? When are we going to have the mics working? I would turn them at a little bit of an angle. - That's much better. - Thanks, guys. How are you? I have waters on every chair. Tissues on every other chair. And there's, um, bug spray. - Aw, you're so good. - For everybody. Okay. Oh, there's Senator Nielsen. Hi. I got my college connections medal. For my senior year. And I got my money, because graduating. We're here. I graduated! Good evening. Can you believe that we are here, actually here on our beautiful Paradise High School campus... to celebrate and welcome the Paradise High School graduating class of 2019 back to their home field? The fact that we here tonight to celebrate this milestone is a miracle. Because you survived one of the most destructive wildfires in our nation's history. It left us a different people. You are the first generation of Paradise High School graduates to rise from the ashes of what life was, and take a bold step forward into a new and uncertain future. But with what you've been through, you have what it takes to persevere. Congratulations, and good luck. Thank you, Sheriff. We will begin the announcement of our graduates. Congratulations. Congrats, yeah. Congratulations. How are you? - Good. How are you? - Good. Kyra Regan. I love your hat. Thank you. Harmony K. Von Stockhausen III. Margaret Thompson. Emily Viviana Sanchez. Zach Boston. Brandon Burke. Savannah Reevis. That's it. That's it. Hey, Bobcats! Yeah? Hey, Bobcats! Yeah? Stand up and cheer and let us know you're here! Bobcats, Bobcats! Go, fight win! Yeah! It is with great honor that we present the Paradise High School graduating class of 2019. 2, 3, fire! 1, 2, 3 fire. We welcome you here to celebrate the life of Philip Allan John. He served our community in so many ways, Paradise Rotary, chair of Paradise Fire Safe Council, Wildfire Ready Raccoon. Member of the Butte County Planning Commission, town of Paradise EO. Known for his generosity of his talents and his time and his gifts to anyone in need. And I want to say lovingly to you to the family and to the friends that we need to continue on that legacy. Last Sunday, Phil and his cousin were coming to the end of a 40‐mile bike ride when Phil's heart stopped and he took a bad fall off his bike. Many medical complications resulted from the fall that caused his heart to stop beating. And a stress test, if he would've taken the time, would have indicated that. If there's a lesson to any one of us, especially after the last seven and a half months, it is the fact that we need to put our health first. My dearest Phil. I promise that I will never stop loving you. I promise that I will take care of myself and the family we have built. I promise to make you proud. I will learn to let your beautiful memories help us as we grieve. ♪ ♪ One of the things that spread the Camp Fire through Paradise was all the spot fires. And all those little baby trees are what carries the fire up into the crowns. And up in the crowns when the wind's blowing, that's how you get the one‐mile, the two‐mile spots. What we want to do in here with our burn is we want to get it hot enough to kill all these little baby green trees. People's fear of fire is preventing us from putting fire on the ground here in a good way. In a way that'll make the people who live out here safer. But fire's not the enemy. I'm at, like, 58 and, uh 58 and 43. Yep, I'm there. 59 and 43. Okay. Danny's people have been burning here for thousands of years, and there's still forests, you know? In Hoopa, we actually do a lot of prescribed burns in a lot of our village sites. We don't want to kill all the trees and scorch the land. You just want to manage how many trees are growing. We've been doing it for centuries. The whole thing about living in the woods is figuring out a balance. We like to think that we can control nature. Fire doesn't care what we think. And whether it's the railroad or arson or PG&amp;E, or lightning, we will have fires. There's nothing we can do to keep that from happening. I'm excited. So, this is the bedroom. I'm standing in the bedroom. One of them. Yeah, it's gonna be nice. I'm going to have this house built soon. So I'm not going to be the first one, but I, it's not about that, you know? It was never about that. It was always just wanting to come home. - Mom? - Yes? Do we have, can we have some towels? Yeah. When we first got here, the kids were stressed out, throwing fits and stuff. Now the kids are actually happier. They know that we're going to be here for a little bit. And, you know, the kids call it a FEMA home. FEMA's. It's FEMA's. But are we staying in it? Yeah. I have to remain in Paradise because of Arabella going to school in Paradise. Uh‐oh. Um, I'm going to start school in a few days. I've got pencils and then some crayons. I think I'm a little lost. I don't really know where I'm supposed to be. It just says Warehouse. Is it, like that building up there? Oh, it's, so they forget to switch it, so it's gym. Today, first day of school, is always like this. It doesn't take a fire for everything to be hectic and running around and trying to figure things out. It did add to it this year. We actually didn't have water, because we had an issue with our filtration tanks that we had installed out front. Ew. But, yeah, everyone seems very happy, very positive and all that. Hi, Fern. This is Carly Ingersoll, school psychologist at the high school. The wheelchair, we did get it ordered, it's all been confirmed now, and it is on the way. Thanks so much, Fern. Talk to you soon. Bye‐bye. Hello, this is Carly. I'm really thankful that school started. We're talking about the future now. We've, we've had our time in the past and dealt with the trauma. And we really are going to heal together. These kids are everything. And the fact that they came back, we can come back. If you can't hear us, we'll yell a little louder. If you can't hear us, we'll yell a little louder. We're from Paradise, couldn't be prouder. If you can't hear us, we'll yell a little louder. For us to have this number of kids, the first thing I thought was, "I've got to call Phil." Because he would have loved it. I am announcing my retirement. Home is where the people you love are, and Phil's not here. I hate this fricking view. Wouldn't it be nice just to wake up and have this be a bad dream and have Phil be here and have no burnt down. Mm‐hmm. Crap everywhere? There's a bunch of dragonflies. Right after the fire the police department was put on 13‐hour days indefinitely. Like, no days off. And my wife and I were having issues. And then after Christmas, I, I moved out into the trailer. And my ex‐wife has the loss of use policy money, and she's staying in, in a house. I have the boys Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and every other Thursday. How do you like trailer life? I really miss my home showers. They're so cold. The one thing that we definitely agree on is to keep the focus on the boys and try and figure out what kind of future needs to be built for them. I don't see it being here, in Paradise. PG&amp;E announced it had reached a $13.5 billion settlement agreement with wildfire victims. We're talking about thousands of wildfire victims, past fires as well. So, we don't know if individual victims will really see a lot of money. There's a lot of people here real messed up from this fire. A lot of guys that want to come back and their wives won't, they were so traumatized. Alright? It's alright. I'm ready. Let's go. It's big deal. Alright. I'm fortunate my wife wants to come back. New key, new home. - Welcome home. - Welcome home. We had a long year. It's been a hard year. No more fire... An older guy came by, he says, “My wife made this for you guys. Welcome back home.” You know, so that was kind of nice. We don't know him. It's the community, you know, so. A lot of people said it's wrong to rebuild. I'm 74 years old, I don't give a... You know, is it right to build a house in a hurricane zone in Miami on the beach? This is where I want to be. That's not looking all too good. This has been on my property longer than I've been alive. This is a cherry tree. So was that, that, that, that, that, and that. You'll see, like, pictures of Japan and, like, their cherry blossoms and stuff, that's what I had in my backyard. And then I have the running creek. I would just sit out here. Like, right around here. I had a deck right there, so I would sit there, too. And my property was like pure serenity. I loved Paradise. Paradise is my true home. I'm going to move back up here. I'm going to rebuild on this property right here. And I want to raise my kids here. By that time, Paradise will be what it used to be, and even more beautiful. On behalf of the town council and staff, I'd like to welcome everyone here this morning to this very important milestone event. It is so important to remember we aren't alone in this. As we rebuild our lives, we begin to heal. And as we heal, we feel ourselves rising from the ashes like the phoenix. That we will survive, thrive and together we will create a beautiful and lasting community. And if that's not Paradise, I don't know what is. We're from Paradise, couldn't be prouder. If you can't hear us, we'll yell a little louder. Touchdown Paradise! Today is the last day to donate to the Alabama fundraiser. So, if you guys have any last minute donations, put them in super‐fast. We heard about tornados that hit Alabama, and we decided it'd be nice to show them the support that we got. Before I'd see the news and I'd be like, oh, that's really sad. Like, I hope that they can get help and stuff. But now I see the news and I'm like, oh my gosh, I need to help them. We understand the feeling, so... Yeah. Beauregard, Alabama. Oh my God. It is the worst tornado outbreak the United States in nearly six years. Dorian is now one of the most powerful hurricanes in history. Cape Town could become the first major city to run out of water. Floodwaters in Bangladesh, India and Nepal has left tens of thousands stranded. Flames devoured seaside resort towns along Greece's eastern coast. More than a million Japanese people have been advised to leave their homes. We are dealing with record breaking floods. For the first time the threat level across Sydney was dialed up to catastrophic.
