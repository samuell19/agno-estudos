[door shuts] [footsteps going up stairs] [woman] Hello, Lutch! I'm glad you're back. Didn't think you'd be home. [Lutcher] I came home to eat but there wasn't anything here! I bought a lovely steak for supper. Would you like me to cook it now? Only take a few minutes. No, it's too late to eat now. Don't worry. We'll have the steak when I get back, hm? I gotta go out again. [groaning] Will you look at those shoes! Look at 'em! They're all gone to pieces! What d'you expect? You're always kicking at everything all the time! All the stone blocks on the way to the wharf, you kick 'em all the way down and all the way back! Is that right? Oh, well… They'll have to do for tonight. Where you going, Lutch? [sighing] Out. I got a little work to do. [excited] You haven't got a job, have ya? In a manner of speakin'. You're not going back to sea again, are you? No, baby, don't worry. -I'm not going back to sea again. -Oh, I'm glad! Oh, you ought to have a newer shirt as well. The collar's does back on on this one. I wish you could have a new one. There are a lot of things you ought to have, Maisie. And you know why? -Because you're a good kid, that's why! -[she chuckles] You're the best friend I ever had. -I love you. -Hm! I don't know why! You get nothing but a hard time around here. Why? Why do you love a crazy screwball like me? Don't say that! -You must never say that again! -Well-- [Lutcher] Don't be silly. -[she breathes heavily] -I… I didn't mean that. Well… I gotta be goin'. -Wish me luck. -[chuckling] Sure! Good luck, Lutch. Wish you'd tell me what for! If I wanted to tell you, baby, I'd tell you. Wouldn't I? I'm superstitious, you know! If you tell people somethin' good is gonna happen, that everything's gonna be bright, and then nothin' happens, you look like a fool, don't ya? [chuckling] I suppose so. Oh, Lutch! I had to buy three more packs of soap to get the rest of the flowers. We've got a dozen now! Look! They're Plasterteks, it says here. -Don't you think they're beautiful? -Yeah, they're lovely. Well, I'll see ya when I see ya. [intriguing music] [footsteps going down stairs] [intriguing music intensifies] [intriguing music swells] [intriguing music continues] [car engine roars by] [intriguing music continues] [intriguing music fades] Ellen? Oh! I've been calling Jason to tell him I'd be home late but I couldn't get hold of him. He shouted something from downstairs this morning, I think he said he was gonna be late too but I didn't hear what he said. That's alright, let him get his own supper! I leave a note for Fred, tell him supper's in the fridge, he can take a tin opener and help himself to what he fancies. Newlywed enthusiasm, that's what that is, Doris. You forget our American bride has only been married six months. We'll soon straighten her out! -What about a nice drink? -Good idea! Do you mind if I don't join you? I really don't feel up to it. Look, let Jason fend for himself. -We only have one afternoon a week. -No, it's not that. It's just that I… I don't feel very well. Come to think of it, you don't look well either. [Doris] What's the matter? Hm? Oh, it's… it's just that I have a headache, that's all. If I have a walk in the fresh air, I'll probably feel better. You wouldn't rather we took you home? No, really. Now look, you go on and have your drink. I'll see you some other time. [loud engine roaring] -Bye. -Bye! [intriguing music] [intriguing music intensifies] [intriguing music continues] [intriguing music intensifies] [intriguing music lightens, then fades] [upbeat lounge music] [indistinct chattering] -What? -Isn't that Ellen, over there? So it is! I thought she was going to the cinema with her girlfriends. I'm just going to say hi to my wife, I'll be back in a minute. -[upbeat lounge music continues] -[chattering] [man] Ellen! Doug! Jason! What are you doing here? I told you this morning, the Henderson deal. [distorted voice] His office is across the street. [background chatter and noises] [distorted] Ellen, what are you doing here? [background noises continue] -We nipped out for cigarettes and a drink. -Gin and tonic, I suppose? [distorted] We saw you on the other side of the street. -[distorted] Ellen? -[background noises grow louder] -[customers laughing] -Come on, Ellen, make up your mind! [laughter and noises grow even louder] [customers roar in laughter] -[distorted] Ellen? -[background noises resounding] [distorted] Come on, love! Make up your mind! [distorted voices and noises grow deafening] You alright? -I must… Oh! -[glasses shatter] [laughter stops] [lounge music continues] [Jason] Ellen, what is it? [waiter] I'm awfully sorry, sir! -She walked right into me. -Never mind. -[woman] What happened? -Lady could hold her gin, I suppose. This way, sir, into my office. There's a couch you can rest on. [manager] Don't just stand there, get this mess cleared up. I'm sorry you've been disturbed, ladies and gentlemen. [eerie music] [eerie music fades] [manager] Shall I call a doctor? No, it's alright. She's coming round. [faintly] Oh, Jason… It's alright, my darling. I'm right beside you. [sighing] I fainted. I've never fainted before. -Oh, darling! -Squeeze very hard. -I'm with you. -[gasping] Just hold me! -[sighing] All the way. -[she breathes heavily] Now, you just lie back and relax for a few minutes. Doug and I will take you home. Oh, no! No, no! I… I'm alright! I… I can go by myself! -[panting] Really! I… I'm alright! -[calmly] Darling, be sensible. You gave us a terrible scare. We'll take you home. No, please! I tell you, I'm much better! Now, that's not true! You've been acting strangely for over a week now. You're probably sickening for something. [gasping] No! No, no, no, I'm not! Now please, you go and meet Mr. Henderson, you finish your deal. I… I tell you, I'm much better! Do you think I can concentrate on business after seeing my wife faint? You're not married to a monster, you know? I don't want your deal to fall through because of me. [sighing heavily] Darling, you are a nut. Henderson's been a client of ours for years. You come first! First, last, and first again. That goes for me too, Ellen. No nonsense, you're stuck with us. I feel like such a fool, fainting in front of all those people out there. What will they think? -I won't go out there again! -Darling… Hardly anybody saw you. [she inhales sharply] Please, Jason, I beg you! Go back to your appointment. I beg you! No, not another word. We'll take you home. [she chuckles nervously] -Do you mind if I stay here a little? -Of course. Now, not another word. We're taking you home. -[Doug] Right. -May I make a suggestion? This is a private exit. Down that hall and straight into the street. You need feel no embarrassment, no one will see you leave. -Yes! Yes! -How does that feel? I'll get one of the staff to call you a taxi. I'll go tip that waiter you knocked down. [indistinct chattering in next room] -What's wrong, Ellen? -I don't know! I'm afraid. -Of what? -I don't know! Let's get out of here. [intriguing music] 110 Strand-on-the-Green. Okay. [intriguing music continues] -[Jason] Keep the change. -[driver] Thank you. [Doug] There's no hurry. Take it easy at home. [Jason] Never mind, darling, we'll soon be home. -[birds chirping] -[faint intriguing music] [Jason] Darling, you frightened the life out of me in there! You'll feel much better now. Hello, Mr. Sheppherd! [Jason] Hi! I'll go and open the door. [Doug] You'll feel alright when you've had a lie-down. Nothing like being in your own home, get your feet up. [Jason] Watch your step. [gentle music] Come on, darling. Let's sit down. Such gentlemen! I'm really not the crown jewels, you know. Could have fooled me! Ellen, what is it? -[sighing] Nothing, really! -[Doug] Anyone for a drink? Yes, I'd love one. Scotch and soda? This will help. Thanks, Doug. Doug, do you think a doctor could cure a wife who's withdrawn and tight, and won't look her husband in the eye? Darling, what is it? It's nothing! I… I've had a headache all day, that's all. It happens to the best people. Here, have a sip. What is it? Suddenly, I'm married to a queen's counsel! It's nothing, I tell you. Darling, this is Jason, remember? You have a bad dream, I wake up. That's how close we are. What is it? -It's going to sound so silly. -Well, alright, then! If you must know, I've had the strangest feeling all day that that I was being followed. [he chuckles] Followed? You see? I told you you'd laugh. -You actually saw somebody following you? -Yes, I did. Who was it? A man, woman, child? It was a man. I've never seen him before. But why? Why should someone suddenly start following you? [Ellen] It was the strangest sensation. He… he kept turning up wherever I went. [Jason] Perhaps he was a secret admirer. No! No, this was different… It was his face. I… I can't explain it. It was… it was his eyes, they… they were so evil. The first time I saw him was when I went to meet the girls at the cinema. He was waiting when I came out of the tube. Then, later, on the way home, it started to drizzle. I looked back for a cab and… -There he was. -You positive you never saw him before? No, no. No, never. -Let me show you something. -Hmm? Don't be afraid. Come on, tell me. What do you see out there? [she sighs] It's still sun-shining. -[Jason] Anything else? -No. No Frankenstein monsters lurking under the lamppost? [she chuckles] No. I guess maybe I was tired. -You ought to drink more water with it. -[they laugh] Doug, uh… go and phone Henderson, tell him we'll see him tomorrow morning. Tell him our kind of architecture is well worth while waiting for. Oh, I'll paint him a blowing picture. Would you like me to call a doctor to come and see Ellen? That's a good idea. Go and phone Henderson. -[door shuts] -Afraid now? I'm sorry to be so silly, darling, but I… I just couldn't help it. I… He had such an evil face. -[he chuckles] -[romantic music] What do I have to do to convince you that you're as safe as Bugs Bunny? How about kissing your wife? I'll undergo any torture for the sake of cementing Anglo-American relations. [romantic music swells] [sighing] I adore you. [muffled] Adore you! [she chuckles] Flattery will get you everything. It's gotten me everything. Which is the reason I love you so much. -Afraid now? -Mh-hm. Your arms make the world all pink and peaceful. -[he chuckles] -Now, don't tease! I did see somebody. I dare him to try and frighten you now. Did I ever tell you that underneath this English mohair of mine there beats the heart of a Superman? [she chuckles] Oh, you silly man. You could melt an iceberg. -How about a drink? -Mhm… [sighing] Oh, well, I'll fetch the ice. I'm not that helpless. [door opens] [romantic music fades] [doorbell rings] [Jason] Coming! [he hums cheerfully] [loud thud and clattering] [Jason] What do you want? I'm a salesman looking for a buyer. You the lady's husband? What do you mean by breaking in like this? Answer when I ask! You her husband, yes or no? Yes! You better leave before I throw you out! That won't be necessary, friend. [ominous music] [ominous music intensifies] [muffled gunshots] [man] See? Just like I promised. -Sweet and simple! -[ominous music continues] Come on, snap out of it! There's work to be done! -[clattering] -[man grunts] You look pretty good, but save the dramatics 'til the coppers come. [ominous music continues] Where's the rest of my money? [gasping] He's dead! You killed Jason! What are you trying to pull? [screaming] He's dead! He's dead! -[she shrieks] -What's goin' on here? -[loud crying] -You goin' off your rocker? [Doug] Ellen? -I get it! It's that other fella! -[Doug] Ellen! What's the matter? -[ominous music swells] -[Doug] Ellen? Jason? [Ellen screams] No! Watch out! -[she gasps and sobs] -[ominous music fades] -[birds chirping] -[Ellen sobbing faintly] [Ellen sobbing] [gasping] He's dead! You killed him! [sobbing] He's dead! Cut that out and listen to me! We're in this together. I did what you told me. It was your idea, from first to last. I killed him on your instructions. So, don't you ever forget it! Together, all the way! [Doug] That was the deal, and nobody waltzes on a deal. -Not with me! -[man outside] Mrs. Sheppherd? Mrs. Sheppherd? Are you alright? -[doorbell rings] -[man] Mrs. Sheppherd? I gotta get out of here. I still want my money. -[man] Mrs. Sheppherd? -The other nine hundred pounds you owe me. You'll hear from me. -[man] Mrs. Sheppherd? -[dramatic music] [man] Is there anything wrong? -[doorbell rings] -[back door slams shut] [dramatic music continues] [man] Mrs. Sheppherd, you alright? [intriguing music] [intriguing music fades] [footsteps going up stairs] Hello, Lutch! You're back quick. -Couldn't be much of a job, then. -That's right. -How much d'you get for it? -Nothing. -Oh, didn't they pay you anything at all? -Nothing! They have to give you something! If you do the job, they have to pay you for it. [she sighs] We've only got a few shillings between us. I thought we were gonna have a real celebration tonight. Shall I cook your steak for you now? Hmm? No, I'm not hungry. Well, what happened? Did someone get there first? [sighing] Yeah, two other guys! You know somethin'? I hate people. The worst thing that ever happened to this world. They're liars and cheats, you can't trust any of 'em! Some of my best friends are people! -[she chuckles] -You'll learn, that's all I gotta say. Oh, Lutch, don't be mad. You'll get another job. Things always turn out for the best. You know, when I was a kid… I caught a lot of birds one day. I laid a branch of a tree on the ground and covered it with that sticky stuff, that bird lime, you know? And all these birds got stuck on it. [panting] There must have been about a dozen of 'em. [breathing heavily] I wished I could get 'em off, but I didn't know how. I couldn't get rid of 'em. [sighing heavily] So, I ran around, wavin' the branch, shakin' it, bangin' it against a wall. But I still couldn't get 'em off. -I busted their legs and everythin'. -Oh… [panting] I nearly went crazy! I couldn't just throw it away and leave 'em there. So you know what I did? I stuck 'em all in a big tank of water and drowned 'em, and then I ran all the way home. -Don't know what you're talking about. -People! Like I did that to those birds, and I never got punished for it. Nobody ever did anything to me. Those birds hadn't done anything. And people are doin' that all the time. -Killing birds? -No… Lying, cheating, hurting things. And just because they're people, nobody does anything about it. -Lutch? -[he sighs heavily] What? I love you, Lutch. [clock chiming] [inaudible conversation] Ah! -Feeling any better, Mr. Randall? -Hmm? Oh, yes, thank you. Nurse Harris says Mrs. Sheppherd's coming out of the sedative. -We'll be able to talk to her soon. -Hmm… I thought you might come with us, let her know you're around. No! I… I mean, uh… Shouldn't she rest? There's time for questioning later, she's in no condition. Mr. Randall, I've been at Scotland Yard for over 25 years. I'm not one of the one-dimensional, stony-faced police brutes you see on the cinema screen. I like women, I have a wife and three daughters. I still get out to get them hot water bottles when they're ill. -[he chuckles] I'm sorry. -You needn't be. Now… You said you were upstairs phoning when the shots were fired. Why? I was trying to get a doctor for Ellen. I told all this to the Sergeant before. Now, tell me. Why a doctor? She'd fainted when we met her at the bar this afternoon. It's why we brought her home, she was tense and disturbed. Because of this man she claimed was following her? We didn't believe her at first. Jason tried to laugh her out of it. What happened when you heard the shots? Well, they were muffled. I wasn't sure what I'd heard at first. Then, Ellen screamed… and I ran downstairs. Jason was dead. I didn't see the killer at first… until Ellen screamed again. Then, it was too late. He came at me and hit me with his gun. I had no chance to… Think you'd recognize him again? I'll never forget his face. Then, keep it in deep freeze. It may be our only link. Anything else you remember? -No. -Something he said or did? [rushed] Nothing, it was all very sudden. I… I was knocked out for a moment. Well, now… tell me about Jason Sheppherd. Know any reason why someone should want him dead? None. He hadn't an enemy in the world. Apparently, he had one! You and he were business partners, is that right? We passed 11 years, we're architects. Sheppherd and Randall, we've got an office in Fleet Street. Hmm… Any trouble there? On the contrary. We've been successful from the beginning. This would have been our best year. And, uh… Mrs. Sheppherd? -What about her? -You tell me. Well, I can't fill in all the details. -She's American, as you know. -Mhm. From the Midwest, originally. Chicago, I believe. Here. -Oh, thank you! Thank you. -She was a secretary in the States. When her mother died, she came in to a lot of money, she decided to travel and see the world. Jason met her one day outside a travel bureau, she'd lost her guidebook. -He volunteered to show her the sights. -Oh, how romantic! It was a whirlwind courtship. I'd never seen two people take to each other so quickly. -They were married within two weeks. -Hmm… What about her family, back in the States? Her father died when she was a child. She was brought up by her mother. There's a picture of her. They were very devoted, I believe. No brothers or sisters, as far as I know. Do you and Mrs. Sheppherd get along? -Yes. -Why the hesitation? No hesitation. Are you married, Mr. Randall? I'm a widower, my wife died some years ago. Hmm. You go out much? Occasionally, not very often. -My work keeps me pretty busy. -You must get lonely at times. Well, that's my business, isn't it? And now, Mrs. Sheppherd will be getting lonely too. Look here, Inspector, if you're implying… We're friends, that's all. She's my partner's wife! She was, Mr. Randall. That'll be all for now. Please leave a number so we can get in touch with you. Oh! Your matches. Thank you. -[whispering] Oh, darling! -[melancholy music] [she sobs] [thrilling music] [thrilling music continues] [music fades] -[doorbell rings] -[melancholy music] [door opens] Hello, Ellen. I was wondering what had happened to you. You needed to rest. So did I. I needed a friend. I didn't even see you at the funeral. I was there. -I stayed at the back. -But why? I've called every day to see how you were getting on. The nurse says you're sleeping better. The nurse is easy to fool. But Doug, why have you been doing this? -Doing what? -You've been avoiding me. Why? You know why! I needed a friend so badly. You were his closest friend. Oh, Doug, I'm so lost! [whispering] He's dead! [sobbing] My darling is dead! [Doug] Stop it, Ellen. [sobbing] These are his cuff links. I found them on the bedside table, just where he put them the last time we came home from the party. [quietly] The last time… I said stop it, Ellen! You're not fooling me for a minute! The killer… I heard him speaking to you, I heard what he said! -What? -It was as if he knew you. As if he were carrying out some preconceived plan. As if he were an assassin you'd hired to kill Jason. Yes… Yes, that is how he acted. -I remember. -What did he mean, Ellen? Why did he say he'd killed Jason as you had instructed? I don't know, the man was a maniac! What does it matter, what he said? Ellen, he killed your husband! I saw my husband murdered. Do you know what that is? I saw him die! Can you tell me any way I'll ever get that picture out of my mind? -And you think-- -Ellen, listen! No, Doug, you listen to me! Look at me! Look deep at me. Do you think life has any meaning now? I'm dead! [quietly] I loved him. I loved Jason. He was the sweetest, gentlest man I ever knew. Do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know that I can go on living without him. -That's enough, Ellen. -The man lied! Whatever he said, he lied! I swear to you on a thousand bibles, I did not plan Jason's death! Believe me, I swear it! Why would I want him dead? For money? You know as well as I do, he wasn't a rich man. For another man? Surely you know how much we loved each other. How much I loved him. [sobbing] How could I? Ellen, forgive me. I had to be sure. [sobbing] If he had to kill someone, why wasn't it me? Don't tear at yourself. The important thing now is to get the man responsible. [whispering] Yes… [gasping] Yes, get him! I'd give my soul! Ellen… I think it's important to tell the police exactly what the killer said to you. Are you convinced he was lying? -Ellen, dear… -Are you? Forgive me, it's all been such a nightmare. Of course, I believe you. [she sighs] Alright… we'll do as you say. We'll go down to Scotland Yard and I'll tell them everything I remember. Good girl. Come on. [phone rings] -I'll get it. -No, it's probably for me. I'll get it. -Hello? -[man] Hello, Mrs. Sheppherd? -Yes. -I told you I'd be calling. Guess who? -[dial tone] -[phone clicks] It was a wrong number. -[phone rings] -I'll get it, it's probably a repeat. No! Don't you understand? It's him! It's the murderer! It's Jason's murderer, don't! -The killer? -[gasping] Yes! -Answer it! -No, no, I can't! -You must! -I can't! Ellen, you've got to answer that phone! This may be the one chance he gives us! Think what's at stake! At the other end of that line is the man who killed Jason! -What are you waiting for? -[phone ringing continues] -Hello? -That wasn't very nice, Mrs. Sheppherd! Don't play games with me! Where's your high-society manners? Hello! Yes, I'm still here. Surprised, aren't you? Didn't think I knew your name? Well, I've been reading about you in the papers. Must have been an elegant funeral. All those fancy friends of his. What do you want? I'm paying my condolences to the bereaved! Don't you have any feelings? What do you want from me? Just what you've promised. The rest of my money. Only now, the price has gone up! I didn't figure I was dealing with the hoi polloi. Let's say my nine hundred quid, plus another thousand. I don't know what you're talking about. Sure, you do, Mrs. Sheppherd! We're business partners, remember? I did my job, and now you're gonna pay off! That's why you're gonna meet me and turn over all that nice dough. Am I getting through? Why does he keep saying I wanted Jason dead? Listen close, make the arrangement, make the date! We've got him! What's going on there? Nothing, I… I'm still here. -Is that somebody with ya? -No! No, nobody. Alright, I'll come. Where do you want to meet? Now, listen good because I'm only gonna say it once. The Hawks' Head Tavern on Alexander Street, eight o'clock tonight. -Tonight? -Come alone. Have the money in a paper bag. And no tricks! If there's a noose waiting for me, there's gonna be one for you too! Okay? Don't let me down! Eight, tonight. Be there! -No, wait! No-- -[dial tone] -[she sighs] -[phone clicks] Well done, Ellen! We've got him! [sobbing] I can't! I can't go through with it! [crying] I want to run away and hide! I can't go through with it! You've got to, Ellen! [crying] Why does he keep saying that I hired him-- That doesn't matter! We know you didn't. Somebody must be behind this. This may be the one chance we have of finding out who that person is! -Now, don't worry. -[she sobs] I'll ring up Inspector McMitchell. [phone clicks] [crying] I can't! I can't! [Doug] I want Scotland Yard. [intriguing music] [Maisie] Oh, look, Lutch! I've gone and cut one of his feet off! Lutch, I've cut one of his feet off! Tough luck. What time have you got? Nearly eight o'clock. Oh, poor little thing. They don't do them on the boxes anymore either, I won't be able to get another one. That's too bad. What are you doing? -Having a haircut! -You had a haircut on Tuesday. You're too smart for me to argue with. I wasn't arguing, Lutch. -Lutch-- -Shut up! [ominous music] You've been standing at that window for ages now, Lutch. You waiting for something? I like your hair like that anyway. Do you think I could stick this together with spit? Why not? -What you waiting for, Lutch? -Thanksgiving! [she chuckles] Well, it won't be long now. Nearly eight o'clock. We don't want to keep our friend waiting. Let's hope he hasn't creeped around and noticed anything different. -Hold my hand, Doug. -There, there. I'm so frightened, I don't know what to do. The thought of having to look at that man's face again, I… Mrs. Sheppherd, I can assure you there's nothing to be frightened of, you'll have complete protection. -Is there any reason why I shouldn't go? -There's one very good reason. Why put Mrs. Sheppherd in danger again? I know what the man looks like. Let her stay here. She's been through enough. We can't allow this man being a fool, he'll be watching. If Mrs. Sheppherd doesn't show up, he won't show up either. However, if she feels she can't go through with it, we can't force her. -Well, Ellen? -You're a darling, Doug. But this is something that I want to do. It's something that I have to do myself. It's probably the last thing I'll ever be able to do for Jason again. No matter what happens to me… I'll do it. There's one thing I can promise you, nothing will happen to you. It's getting late, we ought to get started. -Alright. -Now, here's the money. It's been marked, just in case. How light it feels! There's nothing to be afraid of. Hand over the money and give us the signal. We'll be there. Will you remember that? [car horn honks] Look, Lutch, I finished it. Isn't it nice? It's Maxy and Mousey! [chuckling] I think it's lovely. It's funny, though, isn't it? I don't like mice, really. I hate 'em! When I was a kid, our house was always full of mice. They used to frighten me. One of 'em used to get right into the bedroom, I was scared stiff! It used to squeak all night long! Why didn't you get up and oil it? -Oh, Lutch, that would have been cruel! -Be quiet, will ya? I think my turkey's just comin' round the corner. [intriguing music] Don't worry, Mrs. Sheppherd. Everything will be alright. -[intriguing music continues] -Baby… I want you to do something for me. Hmm? -[glasses clinking] -[indistinct chattering] [intriguing music continues] [barman] Yes, love? Uh, two bottles of pineapple, please. -Take away? -Uh, yeah… -Oh… -[coins clattering] -[Maisie] Ta. -[glass clattering] [ominous music] The same for me, please. [glass clinking] Two-sixty, please. [intriguing music] [music intensifies] [music swells] [music stops] [quietly] Mrs. Sheppherd. Fancy meeting you in a dive like this! -You said eight o'clock. -Oh? Well, I had to be sure that you were all by your lonesome. -I've been watching from the outside. -[paper bag crinkles] What's in the, um… the paper bag? Mm! Smells delicious! You played it real smart, for a change. Did I? Now, relax! Have a drink. The treat's on me, doll! You got your money. What more do you want? [Ellen] He's the man! Arrest him! -[Ellen] It was him! -[ominous music] -[loud thud] -[furniture clattering] [smashing] -[thuds] -[he exclaims] [ominous music continues] [loud whistle] [car brakes abruptly] [ominous music continues] -It's alright, sir, we've got him. -Take him to the car. [Lutcher] Filthy coppers! You filthy coppers! [Lutcher] What are you arresting me for? I haven't done anything! I haven't done anything! [Lutcher] You lousy coppers! It took three of you to do it, didn't it? She'll tell you what I'm talkin' about! Ask her, she'll give you plenty! Ellen, are you alright? [she sighs heavily] [sobbing] Oh, Doug, it was horrible. He still thinks it was me. -He still says that I hired him! -He'll never be able to say that again. Come on, I'll take you home. [intriguing music] [intriguing music fades] [indistinct chattering] -[court clerk] Silence in court! -[chattering stops] Carl Lutcher. You are charged that on the sixth of June at 110 Strand-on-the-Green, you did murder Jason Sheppherd. Do you plead guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Is the accused represented? I want to handle my own defense. I know how to do it. Lawyers haven't done me much good in the past. -You may sit down. -[audience muttering] Call Detective Inspector McMitchell. Detective Inspector McMitchell. [door shuts] I swear by Our Mighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Detective Inspector Gordon McMitchell. Tell the Court where and under what circumstances you arrested the accused. At 5:30 p.m. on the tenth of June, I received a call from Mr. Randall, asking me to go see Mrs. Sheppherd at her flat, at 110 Strand-on-the-Green as soon as possible. When I arrived, she told me she'd made arrangements to go that night to the Hawk's Head Tavern to meet the man who'd killed her husband. I went to the public house with six officers in plain clothes and arrested the accused after a struggle. He was taken to Scarlow Road police station, where he made a brief statement in which he said, "Yes, I killed Jason Sheppherd, but Mrs. Sheppherd paid me to do it." -[audience muttering] -Thank you, Inspector. That's all. But didn't I say in the statement that she came to me, asked me, hired me to kill her husband, and that she'd pay me 1,000 pounds? You did. Although, you didn't mention the amount of money. Thank you! [audience muttering] You may stand down. Call Douglas Randall. [door opens] [court clerk] Douglas Randall. [door shuts] I swear by Our Mighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Tell us your full name and address, please. Douglas Arthur Randall, one Makepeace Road, Hounslow. Where were you on the night of the sixth of June last? I was at the home of the deceased. Will you tell us in your own words what happened? I was upstairs telephoning, when I heard Ellen… uh, Mrs. Sheppherd scream. I rushed down and the first thing I saw was Jason Sheppherd's body lying stretched out in the hallway. Then, the accused rushed at me and struck me with a gun. I fought him… but he hit me again and I was knocked out. -Do you see that man in the Court now? -[Doug] Why, yes! Could you point him out, please? It's him! -[audience muttering] -Thank you. No more questions. You may stand down. Call Mrs. Ellen Sheppherd. [door opens] [clerk] Mrs. Ellen Sheppherd. -[audience muttering] -[door shuts] Step in the witness box, please. Take the book in your right hand, and read what's written on the card, please. I swear by Our Mighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. [judge] What is your full name and address, Mrs. Sheppherd? Ellen Mackenzie Sheppherd, 110 Strand-on-the-Green. And you are the widow of the deceased man, Jason Sheppherd? [Ellen] Yes, I am. How long were you married? Six months and four days. Six months and four days. Mrs. Sheppherd, you heard earlier in the Coroner's Court that your husband was killed by three bullets fired from a 32-caliber revolver. -Were you present when that occurred? -Yes, I was. Is that man who fired those shots here now? He is. Would you point him out to us, please? The man in the box. [audience muttering] Thank you, Mrs. Sheppherd. Now, tell us in your own words what occurred. Well, I… I wasn't feeling very well. And Mr. Randall had gone upstairs to telephone for a doctor. My husband and I were in the living room, I had just gone into the kitchen to get ice for our drinks, when the doorbell rang. And a few minutes later, I… I went into the hallway. And… this man, he had… forced his way in and he was talking to my husband. I couldn't hear what they were saying but I know that Jason was very angry with him. He was asking him to leave. And then… And then, suddenly, he… he'd pulled out a gun and… he shot Jason. [audience muttering] I was struck dumb, I… I didn't know what to do! It was all so unexpected! If I'd known, maybe I'd have… I'd have grabbed the gun, or… It… it was just so unexpected! One moment, he was… [sobbing] He was alive, and the next… Take your time, Mrs. Sheppherd. Would you like to sit down? [audience muttering] After that, I… I can't remember. I… I just stood there. The man was saying something to me, but… all I could see was… Jason lying on the floor. [whispering] He was dead. I know I screamed and Mr. Randall came running downstairs. And the man yelled something at me, but my head was spinning around and… I… I think I was kneeling by Jason's body. Mrs. Sheppherd… can you think of any reason why anyone should want to kill your husband? No! No reason at all! Thank you. That's all, Mrs. Sheppherd. Thank you. Mrs. Sheppherd! Didn't you hire me, pay me money, or at least promise to pay me money, a thousand pounds in all, to kill your husband for you? No! Well, if you didn't hire me to kill your husband, can you think of any reason why I'd want to kill a perfect stranger? Somebody I never knew until the day I'd killed them? I don't know! All I can say is… maybe you're confusing me with somebody else! Oho! So, that's it, is it? You're saying I followed the wrong woman and killed the wrong husband! I don't know! All I'm saying is that… well… I can think of no reason why you would want to kill my husband. You are double-crossing me! But you won't get away with it! You hired me! We discussed it together, met several times! You paid me 100 pounds to begin with. The balance to be paid after I killed your husband! Never! I loved him, he was my whole life! [she sighs] How could I? Ask anybody who knew us! Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough to me already? Mr. Lutcher, you had elected to conduct your own defense, and you are fully within your rights in doing so, but you must conduct your case as Counsel would. That is to say, you may only ask questions and furthermore, you must accept the witness' answers and not add comment of your own. But she must answer my question truthfully! You swore on the Bible to tell the truth! Now, did you or did you not… ask me, hire me, pay me… to kill your husband, Jason Sheppherd? No. May you rot in Hell! [audience gasps] She planned the whole thing! She's lying! [clerk] Will you please be quiet? You have been warned that you may only ask questions at this stage. We cannot have this sort of conduct! You may stand down. [audience muttering] We have no further witnesses, Your Worship. [audience muttering] What are they talking about? I think he's having a word with his clerk to make sure he's got enough evidence to send Lutcher for trial. Of course there's enough evidence! He's even admitted it. Carl Lutcher, you are charged that on the sixth of June at 110 Strand-on-the-Green, you did murder Jason Sheppherd. Do you wish to say anything to the charge? You are not obliged to, unless you wish to do so. You have nothing to hope from any promise, nothing to fear from any threat which may have been held out to induce you to make admission of guilt. Do you wish to say anything to the charge? [Lutcher] I do! I have nothing to hide! Then, you make a statement from the dock, or give evidence on oath from the witness box. But I must point out that if you give evidence on oath, you can be questioned. I want to make a statement on oath! [Lutcher] It might be months before a trial. [Lutcher] Mrs. Sheppherd is free, she can go anywhere! [clerk] Mrs. Sheppherd has not been charged with anything. If you wish to make a statement, you may do so. I swear by Our Mighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. [clerk] What do you wish to tell the Court? Everything! And I'm gonna start right from the beginning. It was about, um… the third week in May. I stopped off in this pub on the way home from work one night. There were two guys who started a fight with me on the outside just because I'd accidentally spilled a glass of beer on 'em. I knocked one guy down, I had the other one up against the wall, just putting the finishing touches on him, when the first guy jumped me again! [Lutcher] Boy, did I give it to him! But he wasn't much of a fighter, he didn't even get his hands up! By the time he'd finished in a pile of garbage cans, he'd wished he'd stayed home. Now, I'm not mean, but I don't like to get mixed up in anything I can't finish. And then, I turned around. And what do you think? The little runt was trying to run away! So, I went after him. If he had headed for the road, he would have been alright. But I got him! We were down there, under the seawalk. And I decided I'd really teach this guy a lesson. So, I gave him a couple of free right-hand moves. And then, a solid kick just for good measure. And then, I figured, "Oh, what the heck, we're alone." I was just about to… [croaking sound] When suddenly, I had the feeling somebody was watching me. And I looked up, and it was her! In a telephone box. What are you gonna do? I had egg on my face. So, I put the knife back in my pocket and walked away. As far as I was concerned, that was the end of that. I'd forgotten all about her! Hmm! Until a couple of days later… I saw her again. I'd been in the same pub, uh… havin' a few drinks, and I'd come out for a little fresh air. I don't know how long she'd been sitting in the back of that cab because I never noticed it… at first. Well… I was havin' a little trouble with some beer bottles, as I remember. Anyway, finally, I saw her. And I waved. And I think I said, uh… "Hello, baby! Come and have a drink with me!" -[car engine starts] -But she wouldn't. She just told the cabbie to drive off. "Okay," I thought. "That's the way you want it? Okay!" Maybe she's just another broad down here doin' a little slummin'. Anyway, there are plenty more pebbles in the sea. Have a smoke and forget about it. Mr. Lutcher, what you're trying to tell the Court is that this was the same woman you saw again? Yes, the same woman, like I said. She was sitting there, waiting for me. -Waiting for you? -Yes! With only a brief glimpse in a telephone box, after a few drinks, and at a distance… -You could recognize her? -Yes! I see… I got thinkin', in the back of my head… that she was up to something. And I wanted to know what it was. It didn't take me long to find out because the very next day… I was walking down the street and I saw her getting into a cab outside the pub. I figured that she'd been in there asking questions about me. So, I… [loud whistle] …whistled down the cab, ran over to her for a few words. And I asked her if she'd been inquiring about me. And she said that she had. And that she admired the way that I'd handled that bloke. And was wondering if I'd do a little job for her. And I said, "Oh, that depends." She said, "Get in the cab. We'll ride around and talk about it." So, we rode off. And then, after a bit of nonsense… she came right out with it. She asked me there and then if I knew of anybody who'd be willing to kill a man for money, or would I do it myself. And I said, "Sure! Sure! Lead me to it!" Then, she outlined the whole plan. She had it all worked out. You know what I mean? First, she told me the name of the cinema she'd be at that Wednesday afternoon. I was to hang around and wait for her to come out. Then, follow her to this cafe, where she was gonna meet her husband. And when they came out of there, I was to follow 'em home. And after a couple of minutes, I was to break in, kill him, make it look like a robbery, [shouting] collect the rest of my money for doin' the job! And disappear! And that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth! [audience gasping and muttering] [quietly] He's lying, Doug. The man's mad. This is very interesting, Mr. Lutcher, but what evidence can you bring to prove your story? Well, I don't have any witnesses, if that's what you mean. She was too smart for that. She's cunning. She always insisted on meeting me in the quiet places. It was her idea that we shouldn't get to know too much about each other. Anyway, I was to watch for the man that went home with her. But there were two of them! That's why I asked the bloke if he was her husband before I shot him! I did what I was hired for. If you charge me, charge her too! Before everybody, I take an oath that she's as guilty as I am! Mr. Lutcher, I see you describe yourself as a dock worker. Yeah, off and on… Here, the States, wherever I been. "Off and on?" You mean, you don't work as a docker all year round? Oh, no! I get around! Yes, I'm sure you do. Mr. Lutcher, will you tell the Court where you working seven months ago? Uh… I don't know. -When do you mean? -I mean, seven months ago. Were you by any chance working in the East India docks about the time… uh, that… that sailor, able seaman Ellis, was found stabbed to death? Oh, no! Don't you try to pin that on me! I was in Blackstone at the time! Blackstone? You mean, Blackstone Mental Institution? [audience muttering] [quietly] Yes… but I wasn't insane. They put me in there because I drank too much, that's all! It was a mistake! I was let out cured! [shouting] I don't drink anymore! I'm not mad! In fact, I think I'm the only sane one here! [shouting] None of you can see that she's lying! Why don't you believe me? She's lying, I tell you! She's lying! [quietly] You pigs! You stinking, rotten pigs! -[audience gasps] -You think that I'm crazy! I know, I can tell by the look on your faces! [shouting] You're the lunatics! I'm sane! [quietly] I've got a certificate that says so! I keep it under my mattress. I look at it every night. It's a coil-spring mattress, the best mattress that money can buy. Maisie told me that I should always keep it in a safe place. I got one! You got one? Where's yours? -You can't prove one! -Take the accused back to the dock! [shouting] You're all maniacs! She planned the whole thing! -[audience muttering] -She's guilty! She's guilty! -You know you're guilty! -[judge bangs gavel] Silence! I find that there's a prima facie case for the accused to answer. Are you gonna charge her? She did it all! I'm not gonna take the rap for her! You charge her! If she's not guilty, I'm not guilty! You're all stupid! You've all been taken in by her appearance! Look at her, sitting there, all dressed and black! She's laughing at you! Look at her! She planned it all! She came to me and begged me to kill her husband! She hated him! She wanted somebody else! Silence in Court! I direct that the plea of not guilty be ended and the accused be remanded in custody for trial at the Central Criminal Court. Take the accused away. You don't now a double-cross when it's right under your nose! What kind of justice is this? You call this justice? [muffled shouting] I'll prove it! Even if it takes a hundred years! [shouting fades] That's what I'll do! She's guilty! She's guilty! -[faint shouting] -Will Mrs. Sheppherd stand, please? [door shuts in distance] The Court would like to express its thanks for the way in which you gave your evidence. Given the circumstances, it must have been a severe ordeal. Thank you, Mrs. Sheppherd. [audience chattering] Well, I hope you believe me now. -Don't be silly, Ellen. I never said-- -Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. That was unkind of me, wasn't it? -Forgive me? -Of course. Oh, Inspector, I'm so glad it's all o-- -May I see this? -[paper rustling] [Ellen] When was this taken? I didn't see any photographers. Press photographers are very adept at this sort of thing. I think they even have cameras to take pictures around corners these days. -It's the first one I've seen. -And the last, I hope! I've had enough police… if you'll forgive me, and reporters to last me a lifetime. Goodbye, Inspector. -And thank you so much. -Don't mention it. You look tired. A change of scenery might do you a lot of good. Yes… Yes, you're right. -Well, goodbye. -Goodbye, Mrs. Sheppherd. -Mr. Randall. -Goodbye, Inspector. [intriguing music] [Maisie sobbing] [Doug] Taxi! Oh, for Christ sake, get away, get off, pests! Taxi! Don't be such a damn nuisance! [Doug] 110 Strand-on-the-Green. [Doug] Get out of here! [intriguing music intensifies] [intriguing music subsides] [intriguing music swells] [intriguing music softens] I wouldn't mind betting some of those reporters have followed us here. -What would you like? -Hmm? Oh, anything. You know… I think the sooner you get out of this house, the better. Where will you go? Back to America? Probably… -How long will it be before the trial? -Oh, at least a month. If I were you, I'd go somewhere where the sun shines. Spend some time eating and sleeping, getting a gorgeous suntan, hm? -Don't you want that? -Hmm? -Oh. What is it? -Neat brandy. Best thing I know for giving you a lift. You must need one. -Like me to get you something else? -No, no, this is fine. I wish I could think of something intelligent to say. Funny, isn't it? When you really need it, you can't think of anything. Doug, you are a kind man. -I aim to please. -Thank you for trying. [sighing] I only wished it helped. Only it doesn't. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this sort of situation. -Would you like me to go, Ellen? -Oh, no, Doug. It's not your fault. [sighing] It's just that I… I suddenly find myself sitting here, you're trying to be cheerful, and… I suddenly realized that Jason's never coming back. Don't, Ellen. It doesn't help. [sighing] I know it sounds silly, but… I can't help it… I know Jason's dead, but… I just suddenly realized what it means. I know how you feel. It just suddenly hit you. -Ellen… -Doug! I think I would rather be alone. Do you mind? No, of course not. But don't brood. Try and get some sleep. I'll go down to the office, there's a lot of work to catch up on. I suppose there must be a lot to clear up. Would you like me to phone Doris, see if she can come round? No. No, I'm alright. I… I'd really rather be alone. Alright, if you're sure. I'll phone you tomorrow, we might have a coffee together or something. Try and get some sleep. -[door shuts] -[melancholy music] [Jason's voice] I'd rather have a drink with my wife, thank you. [Jason groaning and kissing] [Jason] Oh, I adore you. I adore you. [whispering] Oh, Jason, I loved you so much. I loved you. [melancholy music swells] [Ellen's voice chuckling] Flattery will get you everything. -[kissing] -[Jason] It's gotten me everything. [Ellen] Oh, Jason, I love you so much. [Jason] Did I ever tell you that underneath this English mohair of mine there beats the heart of a Superman? [Ellen chuckles] Oh, you silly man. You could melt an iceberg. [Jason] Squeeze very hard. I'm with you. -[book slams shut] -[music becomes intriguing] [doorbell rings] [intriguing music intensifies] -Hello, Ellie, baby! Long time no see. -[music fades] Hey, not a bad layout! Elegant, in fact. Was this where the dear departed met his unfortunate end? If you're not out of here in one minute, I'm calling the police. You know, I could be real comfortable here. But it would carry unhappy memories for you, so maybe we ought to move. I'm warning you. There's nothing more you can do to me so get out! Sweetheart, that's the wrong attitude! When a woman's in trouble, it's the duty of her husband to stand at her side. And baby… Here I am! Get away from me! Why, you too good to touch? Remember me? I knew you when you were nothing but a pair of legs on a chorus line in Las Vegas. I was there the night the joint went bankrupt and you were out of a job. You weren't so uppity that night, were you? [chuckling] You were a bad dancer, baby. Even you knew that. You could never have gotten another job in that town. It was either the gutter or me. You were lucky. You picked me. You're through blackmailing me. I'm not paying you another cent. Your beautiful little set-up is over! Not quite, baby! Not quite. Because if I talk, you won't inherit your rich husband's money. You're not really his widow, you're my wife. But I don't want to play it that way. I'd rather be married to a rich, beautiful widow. But I'm not rich. Jason wasn't a rich man. Well, comfortable. Anyway, I do still love you. That's never changed. You gave me the sweetest 30 days I ever knew. You call that living? The fights, the beatings, your drunken rages! If I'd lived with you another day, I'd have killed myself! Baby, don't say that! I've changed, you'll see. With all this money you've got coming, I'll make you a perfect husband. Come on, let's be love birds again. -Oh, you disgust me! -We'll see about that. Let's just see about that, wife dear. I dare you! I dare you to touch me! Baby, I'm-- -[Ellen] Doug! -Who's that? Who is this, the partner? I don't know what you heard but I can explain everything. I'd like to hear you explain, Ellen. Well, it's… it's true. This man and I were married in Las Vegas two years ago. But I was broke and frantic. After a month, I left him. I thought the marriage had been annulled. He promised he'd take legal steps! Oh, I didn't, though. You misunderstood! After I left him, I… I went to New York for a while and I danced in a club. Then, I came to London, hoping I'd do better. Believe me, Doug, when I married Jason, I thought that I was free! [Ellen] It was… only a month ago. I met him on the street, he said he was over here on business. It was only then that I learned that the annulment had not gone through! -Only then! -Well, marriage is a sacred thing to me! Why are you telling him all this? Believe me. Can you understand what I felt? I begged him to leave me alone, to forget that he saw me. [Ellen] But oh, no! I'd forgotten what a despicable creature he was! He threatened to tell Jason about our marriage, and what I'd been doing when he found me! He said he was going to expose a whole scandal that would ruin Jason and everything he owned! Anyway, I met him three times. Each time, I gave him money. Only it was more and more! And Jason? Oh, you know how much I loved him. I couldn't hurt him, I had to protect him! You must know that! So, you and this… person kept meeting? No! No, we didn't! After the third time, I realized how futile it would be, I didn't call or see him again! -Oh, baby, you're making a mistake! -Shut up! Make him shut up! Haven't I been through enough? You did call me, remember? We made a date to meet in that cafe. I waited for hours, you never came back. Hey, you were there too that day. Don't listen to him, Doug! Get rid of him, he's evil! -What are you talking about? -You and your partner were at that cafe. -What cafe? -You know, the day she fainted. You carried her into the manager's office. That's why I stayed out of the way. I waited for hours but she never came back. -[ominous music] -Ellen went there to meet you? -[man] Sure, she did. We had a date. -[ominous music continues] [man] What's the matter? -Leave us alone. -Don't you order me, my wife needs me! Your wife wanted you dead! [Doug] There was a murderer outside that cafe, waiting to follow you and pump three bullets into your body. You're wrong! I don't believe you. The wrong man was there. Of all the pubs in London, we had to choose that one. Oh, my God. Tell him he's wrong! You didn't hate me that much, you didn't want me-- [ominous music intensifies] -[music fades] -[man] You really do. Oh, no… Wait outside. There's an inspector I want you to see at Scotland Yard. I didn't think you hated me that much. Jason worshipped you. I think in a way, I did too. [gasping] Oh, help me, Doug. Help me! I was just fighting for a decent life. I was trying to save what was mine! I made Jason happy, didn't I? -Do you think he's happy now? -Where are you going? I'm going for the police. And this time, I don't think even your mourning clothes are gonna help you. [melancholy music] [she whimpers] -[quietly] Doug! -[key turns in lock] [sobbing] Doug, no! No! No, not the police! -[door slams outside] -No, they won't understand! [crying] They don't understand! -[melancholy music intensifies] -[sobbing] I loved him! Oh, Jason! [sobbing] Oh, Jason! [crying] It was all a mistake! I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
