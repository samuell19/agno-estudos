You're gonna find this. Been enjoying your stay? How long has it been? I can't hear you. You're scared. I can feel it. Weak. Take a good look around you. I want you to watch. I want you to watch me rip your team apart, one by one. You'll never win this war. Coming from your position... I'd say we're doing just fine. Should be just ahead. See anything, Galina? We're close. Just over that hill. Ready? Let's go! Speak English? How about you? Who's in charge here? Over here. Outside. Now. Where's our man? I-I don't know who you're looking for. Is that so? I swear. I don't know anything. Don't push him. Please, they will kill me. They have my family. Now we're gettin' somewhere. I don't know if they're still there. - You don't know if they're still where? - He's crazy! Who is crazy? The Supreme Leader. Always worried about someone talking, always on the move. - No, no, please, please! - Not good enough. Where is he? A-A small village. I think he could be gone by now. Where? Fifteen or so miles to the east. Deserted village after the war. Old village? Yes. It's how he operates. Hidden in the plain sight. Please, please, don't shoot. I swear. I don't know anything else. I swear. - Please don't kill me. - Please let me go. Thank you. I have children. I have children. I have two children in village. Get out of here. Go! Move now! You just gonna let him go? He is going to warn them. Galina? He's been through enough. Galina, if you take that shot, what's it say about us? We're better than that. If that man's fate's death, somebody else pull that trigger. Good work today, team. Did the intel check out? We have two satellites over the village now. How soon till we move in? If we get a positive target, first light tomorrow. Hit 'em right when they're waking up. Perfect. Till then, grab some chow, get some rest. You still up? Can't sleep. Old Russian habits. Where is everyone else? Sleeping. Today was good. Yeah, one step closer. He has been gone for too long. Almost a month now. I can't imagine what he's going through right now. The world has no idea this war is even happening. The thankless service. I hope we are enough. We are. Try and get some sleep. Night. Sir, we've got something. What do you have, Marino? We've confirmed movement in the village. Put it on the big screen. Putting up the footage from two hours ago. Hmm. Trucks. Yes, sir. Looks like they're loading out. - How often? - Two every hour. Time in Washington? Uh, we're seven hours ahead, sir. Get me the president. Mr. President. Sir? Yeah. Come on. Brisco? Commander. We've tracked down what we believe is the current location of the Black Masks. Go on. During the raid, we found credible intel of a location just east of Baghdad in an old Republican Guard outpost. And what does the feed look like? Well, here's where it gets interesting. Our drone footage shows a lot of activity. Trucks in and out every hour or so. My guess is they're on the move. And you think that they're holding Daniel at this location? It's hard to say so for sure, but my gut says yes. They took a hard hit at the village. Haven't seen a sign of them in a month or so. My guess is they're regrouping, getting ready for a new attack. Commander, if you feel with a degree of certainty that this is where they're holding Daniel, then you have my approval. It's a go. Thank you, sir. Bring our man home. God knows what he's been through. Yes, sir. People, we have a green light. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. They continue to hunt for him. We are getting information that they killed all our soldiers and they released the camp villagers. These Westerners, are they trying to prove that they can show mercy? They don't understand. Whether you put on a mask or not, that every single man, woman, and child in this country is a part of our mission. The West is so blind to see the loyalty we have. Our brothers and sisters stand with us. They don't understand the grasp we have on these lands. Every camp, every village, every town stands with you when they hear your message. And the ones that don't are left to rot. Tell me, what did they find? We don't know yet. But a man from the camp is here to explain. He failed to stand his ground for our mission, and now he asks to explain things? For what? He begs for mercy. Mercy? What did he give away? Our position? My leader, he's... Fucking rat. He pleads for the mercy of his family, his children... and his own life. He faces my enemy head on, and instead of picking up a weapon, he runs away from the fight. His every word threatens our mission. Forgiveness is not a motto I stand by. You live and die by your actions. This is no exception. Your orders, Supreme Leader? Grant him his meeting. Let him look me into the eyes and see what I... what we all stand for. This failure cannot go without punishment. If we're going to succeed in our mission, we must put a stop to all the cowards and nonbelievers. We have come too far, sacrificed too many lives, to have petty mistakes between us and victory. I will not tolerate these actions. What do you want to do about the other camps? They will continue to hunt for him. They can continue to hunt. They will find nothing. My leader, they will be closing in. It's only a matter of time. The West, they never stop searching for one of their own. We have to address this. Send out our scouts. I want everyone brought in. I am leading a revolution on the frontlines of war. If I can't trust my men in the field, they can't operate out of my camp in front of me. I will not accept failure on their part. Weak-minded fools will pay the price for standing in our way. Let them know: You stand with me or against me. There is no in-between. They will understand. No more mistakes. Anyone that dares to cross my will will be executed. Wait a minute. My leader? Bring the American. Of course. Let him witness that every action of his so-called team takes against me will be met with a swift and a violent blow. - Agreed. - He can sit in his cage and think about the examples set by his country's actions. Bloodshed is the only currency accepted all over the world. First, the loss of his mission, and now his team is in this area searching for him. His mind on the verge of breaking. Perhaps he will finally begin to understand. What'd you find? When do we load out? Within the hour. Copy. People... Here's what we know: This is the area they currently occupy. Their compound moves in and out of the mountainside. Living close to a mountain provides an excellent place for them to hide. There's only two ways in. Here and here. We're gonna drop you here, about a mile from their location. The desert out there is vast and wide, so it'll provide good cover to get you on the ground undetected. Galina, you'll be the lookout, the closest thing to a tracker we have. Keep tabs on that truck. We do not want Daniel slipping through our fingers, understood? Sir! Let's get our man. All right. Over a mile... that way. All right. Let's move. Galina, what's your count? At least 10. More. Far side. What's the move? In and out. Ralph, Jacques, Xu, you're with me. Galina, do what you do best. Jacques, Xu, hit the far side. Go! Move! Clear. Take cover. Easy, guys. Looks like two trucks left to be loaded. Galina, hold. Do not give away your position. In here. The hell with hold. I have a shot. It's now or never. Daniel could be in there. Then we kill the fuckers and grab him. He's as good as gone if we don't move in now. Where's the American? Where the fuck is the American? I'm not playing with you! No American! Our guy's not here. Let's move. Galina, weapons free, weapons free! Really? Make a statement, right? We're in. They made contact. Move! I'm all right! Stay on! Boss, moving toward your position. Guys, fucking hornet's nest moving your way. They're all over us. We gotta go. Get out now. The transport truck is on the move. I want a drone on that truck now! I wanna know where it's going. On it, sir. Move! Move, move! We're coming out! Nice, Galina. I thought they had us! Not yet. I saw that going better. He's out there. We'll find him. Back to square one. Fuck! We heard. No one can keep their mouth shut these days. Fucking rats are everywhere. Where are we? We are working on the gas compounds for the rest of the sarin gas. We are still reducing its amount needed for a stronger formula. The more compact we can make it, the easier we can move it, undetected. Range on the gas? Much stronger than the one in the village. The process takes longer, but the end result is a hard-hitting blow. Perfect! I want them to spend years figuring out how they could let this place slip through their fingers. No excuses. I think we can all agree that didn't go as planned. I second that. What about the truck? Drone followed them for a few miles and then lost 'em. What do you mean? Well, their movements are basic but effective. Tunnels, underground facilities, all that and more at their disposal. So we lost him. We have limited support. But yes, we lost him. Sir, they're out there. Daniel's out there. We'll find him. Let's be smart, do the work. We'll find him. This is bullshit. James, we need to stay a unit or this whole thing falls apart. Brisco's right. We need to think this through. Just... just take a minute or we're gonna screw this whole thing up. That's easy for us to say. Meanwhile, Daniel's sitting out there rotting in a fucking cell. Hey, I get it. We all do. We've already lost Chris. How many people have you lost from the UK? What the fuck did you just say? We backed you the minute those towers came down in Manhattan. A lot of good men died. Don't talk to me about what it is to lose people. I've had to call mothers and wives, daughters and sons. How many have you had to call? Don't ever say that shit to me again. Not ever! He's right. Ah, I'm gonna start a fire. Eh, you fucking bitches. Ah, you can't start a fire like this, you stupid motherfucker. I'll play some music. I'll play some fucking music! You like that? Huh? You like that? Fucker! Ah? Oh, you want me to make you some fucking music, huh? I'll fucking make you some fucking music! ♪ Be-Bop-A-Lula She's my baby ♪ Ah, fuck it! Hey, come here. I told you, motherfucker. Oh, God. Why are you keepin' me alive, huh? Just kill me. You fucking bitch. That would be too easy. Way too easy. Get him out! Yeah, come on. Open this fucker. Open it, fucker! You ready, huh? I'm just kiddin', boys. Get him! I love it out here. It's so peaceful. Keeps my mind clear. You don't mind, do you? Of course not. Look at you. Your friends have a hard-on to find you. Very, uh... what's the word I'm lookin' for? Valiant. You don't know anything about them. See, that's where you're wrong. I know how you operate. Every step, every move... I'm always ahead. I'll just end this right here, right now. The human body can endure so much. Fuck. How's it goin'? Shitty, sir. War is hell. Anything, sir? Nothing. I have a call with the White House in a few minutes, but I wanted to check on you people. - Waiting on your go. - Good. Sir, we're ready. As you were. - Ralph. - Yeah? I know you sacrificed a lot. You and your country. I get it. Believe me, I do, and if that was one of my guys out there, I'd be saying the same thing, too. He is one of your guys. Commander, each day that passes, our chances of getting Daniel back alive diminish. I understand the facts, sir. He's one of our own. I don't have to remind you of that. We've already lost one man on my watch. We sure as hell are not gonna lose another. Well, let's get this done. Let's get him back. Get on it. Understood. Bring him! Up! Take a good look around. I built all this on a single concept... loyalty. Loyalty's much bigger where I come from. In your culture, people lie, cheat, and steal to get ahead. Those western principles have been eradicated here. Hard work and belief, the very foundation of what you see. When everyone in the world is in loyalty, it's insanity. I'm not trying to get everyone. We want the same things. Our freedom, our way of life protected. Just like you and your American government. And I will do anything to protect my beliefs. The bravest men of our time always begin with a brave idea, and principles are the very core of our existence. Without them, we have nothing. You see, the world is full of dogs. Diseased and deadly. One misstep, and the walls around us come crashing down. I'm not buying it, are you? You see, with just the right push, anything is possible. No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Let this be a lesson of my resolve. Now you understand how serious I am. Take him back. Anything? No, sir. No activity in the area. Small camps are hard to find. Everything blends in. Keep on it. They didn't just disappear from the face of the Earth. We're on it, sir. Getting that workout in? Only thing to do. Forty days. Yeah, I know the day count. Yeah, I'm ready to get this thing going. You gettin' some sleep? No, I can't stop thinkin'. That call is gonna come, you know that, right? And Daniel and the rest of us, we're gonna be lookin' for you to be at your best. What is it? Sir, I think we may have found something. Is it Daniel? This file was uploaded a few hours ago. Press play. With just the right push... No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No! Now you understand how serious I am. He's alive. Looks in bad shape. Who else has seen this? Hard to say. It's been online for a few hours. Okay, okay. Get this to forensics now. We just may have caught ourselves a break. - Yes, sir. - Where's the rest of our team? The armory. Okay. I know it's not much to go on, but we have something. What is it? A video surfaced. He's alive? Daniel was alive as of a few hours ago. From what we can tell, he's in pretty bad shape, but he's alive, and that's the important thing. Can we see the video? Follow me. The guy on the left, he's from the village. Must have picked him up after we left. I'm not buying it, are you? Daniel looks like shit. He's been through hell. You see, with just the right push... No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No! Let this be a lesson of my resolve. We have our people on it. Did you try to source the video's IP address when it was uploaded? We sent the video to Langley. They're the best. We'll have a location soon. How's it going? Find anything? We've had the footage for literally an hour. And? You'll know the second we do. Did you try using any malware? We're not uploading malware to the military service. It is only wrong if used in a bad way. We can't hack military software. All right? This takes time. We'll find something. I do not care about military-grade software. Every minute that goes by could be his last. Hack through it, or I will. I could lose my job! And you will lose more than that if you don't. Got it. Just do it! You know, I was never here. I'll get it. You can't just go through the... If you're going to stand there and give me shit, go somewhere else. If not, shut up, sit down, and help me do this. Yes? That is more like it. We're in! See, it was not so hard. There's not much here. Just a few Internet connections. - Nothing major. - Hang on. - What do you see? - Just wait a minute. It's just desert. There's nothin' out there. Those mountains are the key. Notice the pattern? Yeah. There's a couple of connection pings. I don't get your point. I'll zoom out. Now? It's a wasteland out there. Mmm, perfect place to run operation undetected, no? There. What did you just do? Running an old program we used in Russia. Okay. Now you're just trying to get me fired. Nyet, nyet. Calm down, huh? Let this run. Every file has its source, its root. We're going to find that. Chances are the source will be their location. Let me know when this is finished, yes? Wait, are you just gonna leave me here alone with this running? Yes, and I was never here. We discussed the value of loyalty. You yourself have these values. You serve your country, loyal to your friends and family. During this occupation, we have learned from our mistakes, advanced our mission, and grown stronger. One crystal. Once consumed, the sarin runs through the body, destroying everything in its path. Just like your country, running through our lands, destroying everything in your path. Loyalty. You're fucking insane. No, what I am is someone with a cause. Do you remember that feeling, Daniel, or have you forgotten? My men are willing to die for my cause. Can you say the same for your team? Are they willing to die to bring you back? Daniel, just think of all of your wars, your battles. You may have killed all your targets... ruled our sands for over a decade... but in the end, all you did was leave us the tools to fight you back. To build up and strike. Your bases are abandoned. Your gear rotting in the sand. Did you think we would not come back? Did you think we would not rise up and kill you? Your government made me. They begged me to do it. Without war, what are you? What is your country? War is the very definition of America. Loyalty, Daniel. Remember that line in the sand. Anything? Nothing. Working on it. Got it. Galina took over the computers, running some Russian software. - Yeah? - God bless her. I know her heart's in the right place, but... well, who knows. Maybe she's onto something. Sir, I just want this to end. Me too, son. Me too. Almost there. Did you find it? Just a minute, and it is almost done compiling the data. Got it! Zoom in there. Everything points to this location. No, not much there. That is the point. They love their hiding places. There. The mountains have a natural road. This has to be it. You're all right... for an American. I think we found them. Really? Let me show you. James. Show him. Let's see what you got. - How did you... - You don't want to know. Not exactly legal. Right, I don't want to. We found a lead. It triangulates the signal used to upload the video. - You sure? - Yes! It is a vast desert. Not a lot of places to upload something like this. - Zoom in. - See there? - That's a natural road. - Exactly. You said we lost them right after they entered the mountains, correct? - Correct. - Now follow the road. It goes deeper and deeper between the mountains, then it ends. That's the perfect spot for a tunnel. Right. Most drones use basic scanning software. It is not perfect science. With the terrain change and possibility of tunnels, even if we lost the truck for a moment, it would take drone at least a couple of minutes to reacquire the target. By the time we reset its location, they could have slipped away or gone underground and who knows where those tunnels start or where they end up. Exactly! What's the percentage you're wrong? Ten percent, probably less. Sir, we have to move on this. I hear you, but what if she's wrong? If she's wrong, we're still exactly where we're at right now, hunting. I'm not wrong. Get the team. You may have saved his life. So we should enter from here. Yeah, come off that ridge. Around there, your flanks are protected. That's the plan. How's it looking? Oh, it's hard to say. Everything in this area points to this one location. With this mountainous terrain, it's pretty rough out there. Nothing we can't handle. I'm not questioning you, son, but this mission has to be perfectly executed. One wrong move, and you're trapped and we lose everything we've accomplished. Yeah, they've been one step ahead of us this entire fight. It makes me question why I'm sending you in. We can't afford to lose any more of you. And walking into a heavily armed cave is not my idea of tactics. We could always, um... Why do you have that in here? You never know when you're going to need it. Get the fuck outta here! What do you think? It's not our best option. Well, you've been leading the team. Your call. It's a go for me, sir. We need to move on this. Roger that. Silence. Exactly. Silence over our desert. Silence over our homeland. The sounds of war fading away. Peaceful silence. This is what we're fighting for. These lands... will once again be ours. The silent sound of freedom will echo through the desert sands when we finish our mission. No more helicopters. No more gunfire. Just silence. The people will tell tales... of our battles and sacrifices. If history forgets our names, then let our actions be immortal. Freedom hangs in the balance of this battle. Failing our mission means these deserts will be overrun by Westerners, forever changing our way of life, forcing our people to bow down to their plastic way of life. And this image is not acceptable. Beyond unacceptable. It will mean the death of our world. We have come too far. This mission is far beyond anything you and I can say to the West. Nothing is left but action. They will hear from us with our actions. Finally, our nation will be lifted up and given the chance to speak. Action is what the world responds to. Action is what will set us free. Immortality. Tell me, how is he? The soldiers guarding him claim he lays awake at night, staring at the stars as if the heavens can save him. His mind is fading. His team searches for him day in and day out, and every day that passes by, he goes deeper and deeper into the world of the insane. If his drive for survival was as strong as his drive for victory. Their soldiers might be strong, but they lack the passion and the drive to see something till the very end. I pity those in the West who truly believe they are the best. The best... of nothing. Death stares him square in the face, and he blinks. He is not a true soldier. That is where we have underestimated our enemy before. The West have proven themselves a true adversary. Beatable, yes, but he's still strong. He has remained caged for months now. Yet, he's still a fighter. He may stare off into a night sky searching for... whatever, and praying for his savior to rescue him, but he's still there, fighting. I see a fighter... but weak, without cause. He has served his country bravely. He will lose this fight and eventually, they will lose the war, but I will not deny him the honor he deserves in his death. Today, we shall give him the death that he deserves. When the time is right, he will get what he has been asking for. Daniel... our time together has come to an end. I hope being together has opened your eyes just a little. Say what you want. I've seen what you do. I know who you are. Who I am? Nothing more than idea. A bad idea. You hide behind a mask. The mask is what makes us different... unique. The very image of it haunts your dreams. There's no point to any of this. A little longer. I promise. There's always a way out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You didn't think I'd make it that easy, did you? So what's the move? We need an element of surprise. So far it's only been one way in, one way out. Just the way I like it. Vantage points? The rocks around the mountains are too steep. There's no place to camp out. You're with us on this one. Finally. Everyone up to speed? Yes, sir. Yeah. Looks like we're walking into a fucked situation. - Again. - Duly noted. We're going to get him back. We're ready, sir. Roger that. Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this. This isn't my choice of attack. The clock's running, and we don't have other options. Let's bring him home. Load out! Good luck out there. Bring him home! Yes, sir! Your life is not safe. Safe? Nothing about war is safe. Their technology cannot stop us. We just have to work faster. Alert the camp. We'll move to our base as soon as possible. I want the power cut to the computers. We'll go dark on the web for now. No more loose ends. They are closing for a fight. We have to be ready. I will not tolerate any more loose ends. And the American? They will be coming for him. Good. Let them come for their soldier. They will find nothing but a rotting corpse in the sand. An, um... an execution? For months now, he has witnessed our mission firsthand. To leave a chess piece of that value on the board would be reckless. His mind is weak. He accepted my weapon as a way out. Death is what he seeks, and we will provide it for him. His time here has come to an end. During his final weeks, he accepted the flaws of his nation and their actions against us. Leave a small group of soldiers behind. If we're lucky, we will take out the team on the rescue mission. The West doesn't know when to quit. Even for their own good. Make sure they're alert. We will make all the necessary arrangements. Good. My leader, on your departure, we shall give him a soldier's death. Make it memorable. The American views do not align with ours, but we will provide his exit of this world with honor. Freedom comes with a cost. If there is one concept that is universal, it is the right for freedom, but on our own terms. History will understand our mission. Perhaps, one day, they will understand too. History always favors the brave. History we are about to write, will be nothing short of brave. Get them ready. We move at sunset. - A soldier's death. - Mmm. A soldier's death. Is there a drone in the area? It's 20 minutes out. In 20 minutes, they'll be gone. Sure hope he's in there. Let's move. Come. Move! Move! This isn't going to work. We're sitting ducks. Shh! Over there. On me. Let's go! What have we got? Looks like most of them have moved to another location. Never mind. I guess I just talk to myself. Xu, you're with me. Watch for our signal. Clear. On me. Slowly. On the far side... that one's bigger than the others. Move now. Don't move! Turn around. Nice and slow. On your knees. You speak English? Where's the American prisoner? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? And the convoy, where's it headed? One thing at a time. Where are you holding the American? We're not gettin' anywhere. Where the fuck is the American? I don't know. Ugh, what is taking so long? Fuck this! Don't fuck with me. Guys, they're modifying a sarin gas bomb. It's a waste of time, James. End this fool. Oh. Oh, shit! They are moving in. Wait for their signal. Let's keep moving. He's useless. No, we don't know what he knows. Exactly, and he ain't saying shit. I'm done asking questions. Not so tough without your mask, eh? I'm tired of playing games. Get up. Where is he? You'll never find him. Fuck you! Is that so? Then tell me something, why the mask? You can't see us. You don't know who we are. We're everywhere. Spoken like a true hero. Yet you stand here, confused, begging for a clue. When your cities burn and your lands are destroyed, then finally, you'll understand. Don't move. Drop your weapons. Fuck! I didn't expect this to be how we go out. Me either. What took you so long? Waiting on your signal. The whole camp knows we're here. We gotta move. Fuck, that was close. Jacques, get to the desk. Get what you can. We're gonna do this old school. Okay. Let's go. Clear. Advance. One o'clock! - James, on me. - Let's go. Covering! Move up the hill. Here! We're close. He's gotta be over that hill. Together. - Clear. - Clear. Daniel! Daniel, it's us. We're here, buddy. We got you. Can he walk? Listen, look at me. We have got to move you. Can you move? Yeah. Help me get him up. Take the lead. Sir, we got him! The package is secure. All right. Get outta there! Get Daniel home. Good work. Daniel! Let's get you out of here. Update now. They're on the move. That's all we know. Anything overhead? Our scout drone's in the area, but so far nothing on the scanners. It looks like their transport truck got out before we were overhead. - I need some intel now. - Yes, sir. Contact! Split up! Make some distance between ourselves. Let's go. Let's move. Forward! Jacques, we need to finish them off. I'm working on it. What the fuck are you doing? Trust me. Cover him. One day you'll understand. Why are you keeping me alive? Why don't you just kill me? I want you to watch me rip your team apart, one by one. You didn't think I'd make it that easy, did you? Daniel! Daniel, I gotta get you outta here. Come on. Hey guys, I'm losing him. We gotta get him the fuck outta here. Jacques, push it now, now, now! Hey, Jacques? Sir, we have a confirmed explosion. James, Ralph, come in. Do you copy? Everybody okay? I'm good. Good. Let's move. Jacques! Jacques? Jacques? Here! Commander, we're good. We're all clear. Thank God! You are the maddest dude I've ever worked with. Get him inside. Let's move him quickly. You people look like shit. I, for one, have looked better. He's back and alive. You did good. You saved the life of a soldier. Clean up. Debrief, 19:00 hours. Hooking him up. We have a good feed. Hey, you're gonna be all right. How is he? He's gonna be fine. He lost a lot of blood and needs fluids. He's gonna make it. Good to hear. Thank you. People, I need a minute. Follow me. First off, the report is he's gonna make a full recovery. As for the Black Masks' next move, from what we know, we have 'em on the run. Well, if they are planning something big, there's a lot of things that seemed off in the cave. I don't think we truly know their mission. Well, as soon as Daniel recovers, he'll give us intel on that. You have anything else? Sir, inside one of the tents, I picked up some intel showing different tunnels. Good. Is that it? All right. Get some rest. Get changed. Today was good. You brought back one of your own. - Dismissed. - Yes, sir. We're almost there. The walls are closing in on them. Or maybe we've just been awake too long, going at it way too hard. Just saying, guys. We're close. I feel it. Let this be a lesson of my resolve. Now you understand how serious I am. You all good, man? Yeah. Listen, man, we're gettin' close. Ralph, we wouldn't have gotten this far without you on the team. We're gonna need you out there. You'll have my best. Yeah, man. Nothing less. You know, you're all right for a Yank. Let's finish this. Yeah, let's finish this. So, they got their man back? Sir, the sarin gas bombs are being unloaded and assembled. I want the remaining gear from the towns brought here and set up. Make sure we have a fucking surprise ready for them when they come hunting.
