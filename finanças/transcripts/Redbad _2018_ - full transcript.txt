Subtitles by explosiveskull My children and grandchildren are starving. My people are starting to believe that Freya has made the land infertile. And that I am cursed. So I think we should double the number of sacrifices. What is this? Four failed harvests in a row. You're a failed harvest. Get away from me. You should have been a farmer. If you wish to sacrifice girls from your own tribe, then that's all the same to us. Your tribe is much larger and more powerful. We've done our duty. More than enough. Why is there all this panic? In the past few years, our tribes have had a lot of prosperity. What do you mean by that? That it will be even worse the next few years? Freya gives and she takes. Sometimes a wonderful harvest. And sometimes a poor one. She has her cycle. And we cannot change that. The spring tide has emptied my tribe's food plate for the coming years. Something has to be done. That's easy for you to say, Odulf. You don't have any daughters. My own sister was sacrificed. But that didn't seem to bother anyone. That's how it has always been. That's how our ancestors did it. Traditie. And that is how your father did it too. Don't tell me you are seriously considering this. I'm listening. But you should say something instead. Does Redbad have something to say as well? If no one else will. Apparently some people like to throw their daughters into the fire to harvest more grain. Maybe we can spend our energy into building new terpen. It is not really reassuring. That my brother's heir does not believe in the customs of his own people. And one of those customs is that anyone can say how they feel. Shall we not discuss our bloodline here, Eibert? It's not about you. And it's not about me. It's about our people. About the interest of our nation. I do not force my will upon free people. Everyone who wishes to participate in the ritual is free to do so. Out of free will. I repeat: Out of free will. Arms up. Are you a Frank? Hey. You should all be working a bit more, instead of praying. Redbad! - What are you doing? - Redbad, no. - I love you. - Yes. You're the son of Aldigisl. They will never let you marry a girl like me. Without titles, without a name. - I am going to take you away from here. - And then? What kind of future can we have? Do you want to run off to an unknown land? Your place is here. And so is mine. No. I decide what I do with my life. - They cannot force you to do this. - No one is forcing me. - This is an honor for my family. - Nonsense! Redbad! I'm sorry. Eventually you would have had to let her go. Redbad, these are the sacrifices we have to make. Then let me go as well. You are the daughter of a king. You will make plenty of sacrifices for your people. This is who we are. - Who I want you to be. - I don't want to be like this. Mother of the sky and the earth. Of fire and water. Of the springs and the trees. Of the animals and the grain. Mother of the ancestors. and the children. Mother, lead me. Mother, feel me. Mother, see me. Mother, hear me! Now! Fate has decided! No. No. No! No! Hey! You need to accept it. What are you doing? I ought to ask you the same question. I have to consider my people, boy. And you only have to consider that one girl. She's your best friend's daughter. This is not just about one girl. You are my son. And the son of Aldigisl cannot let himself be led by self-interest. But also not by fear. You think I don't have the courage. You think I don't have the courage to lead my people. The people are afraid. And if one more harvest fails, people will die. So I have to take that fear into account. And if you want to be their leader you will have to do the same. I believe in our own strength and our love for each other. That's the only thing I'm sure exists. We have our customs to consider. - Sometimes you have to change those customs. - Oh yes? You want to throw everything away? To throw everything away which unites a people? Its traditions, its practices, its customs? If you don't respect that, you don't deserve to be a leader. I don't want to be a leader of a people which clings onto barbarian rituals to ward off its own fears. I've given you every chance to become the leader you want to be. Just like my father did for me. But when he died... I would have given anything to talk to him once more. So he could tell me... and make me understand how lonely it is to wear that cloak. This royal fibula. Listen to the advice your father gives you. Sometimes fathers become old men. Past their prime. I will take the pain away. Fire! Aldigisl! We have to get the children out of the city. Get all the children out of the city! Weapons! Get the weapons! Wall! Wall! Close the ranks! Is this Woden's punishment? It may be. Is this the day we will all die? It probably is. But I do not fear death. And neither do you. Because I know one thing for certain. This is our soil, and our water. Our city and our land. I am a free man. We are free people. And I will not die on my knees. Because I have not lived that way. But we will not be led by our pride. We will now retreat, so we may attack again soon. Sound the horn! Retreat. No. Stay. Redbad. Redbad! Redbad! Back! Come on boys, get out of here. Retreat! The King is dead. Dorestad is ours. They call it a longhouse, Father. A long house. How does it go? Just some small revolts, no central leadership. No leadership. But you know how it is with the barbarians. You can take their land, but we must break their will. Father, this is bishop Willibrord and his pupil Bonifacius. - Come! - They have an authorization from the Pope. Isn't it beautiful? That is a hopeful sign, my Lord. Yes, something these barbarians don't understand, is obedience, humility, the pillars of our faith in Christ. You'll teach them, break them like a horse. - My Lord. - Hmm. Yes. And you. Yes, my Lord? You must be careful. They are wild animals. Chair, the throne from God. We've lost Dorestad. And the Franks now have complete access to the Rhine, to our trade, to our territories. And whose fault is that? Aldigisl was responsible. He was in charge. Under Aldigisl's leadership, the gods have given us years of prosperity. But he was betrayed. By the Franks. My brother was a great leader. But Redbad... What about him? If he hadn't been so reckless Aldigisl wouldn't have been killed. And he rebelled against his own father. He ignored his commands. And why? For a girl. That is what you get, when you don't respect your own traditions, your own culture... They are talking about you. And now Woden has abandoned us. You have the right to defend yourself. Perhaps Woden wants Redbad to be our new king. And you want to go against it? Let Fate decide. Every chieftain has the right to let Fate decide. Eibert, what on earth are you doing? He's your own nephew. Nobody loves Redbad more than I do. But if he has brought this evil upon us, then it will haunt us as long as he is among us. You really have to go inside. You have to defend yourself now. Redbad, listen to him. Do you want to be king? Me? No. Because we still choose our kings here. And no one here will choose a leader with a limb and a cursed leg. Back then I accepted the fact that my younger brother became king. And no one has served him more loyally than I. And now your son may take Redbad's place. That is not on my mind. I respect our customs. They are right. It's my fault. Come, son. It is time. Choose your fate, Redbad. Guilty. Woden has spoken. Is this really necessary? You know what this means for us, boy. Father of the Sea. Accept this sacrifice from us. It is time. No, no, no. Let me go. You have to let me go. I will always love you. Always, always. Your ancestors will watch over you. Don't forget who you are. He's going into the sea, now. Let him go. Let's go home. No! You are my son. And the son of Aldigisl cannot let himself be led by self-interest. I've given you every chance to become the leader you want to be. Just like my father did for me. And if you don't respect that, you don't deserve to be their leader. ...for God is great. And God is good. Do you not want to welcome Jesus into your hearts? He has come to this Earth to save us. It is all written here. It is written. - A book? A book, dickhead. - A book! What is it you want? Do you want to burn in hell for all eternity? Why? On this rock... I will build my church. On this rock I will build my church. Friezen, listen to what the bishop has to say. Or else. Go. Forward. But we cannot spread the word of Christ with violence. I'm not here to bring peace. I'm here to bring the sword. Music, music! John said: For now, I baptize with moderation. But he who comes after me, who is much better than I am, who is stronger than I am, he will baptize us in the Holy Spirit with fire. The might of the true God is with us. Who wants to be baptized? Him! Who else wants to be baptized? Come, come here. Come, come, come. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Next. Come! I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. He's still alive. We'll take him with us. I think he's a Saxon. Maybe he's a Frisian. Which tribe are you from? Who is your father? Clearly this man was banished. His own tribe wanted him dead. Huh? I say kill him, before he brings us bad luck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! We don't just kill people without a good reason. Then what do we do? And can we trust him? The God of sea left this man, alive on the beach and my daughter found him. That's a sign. I don't yet know what it means but I will take you into my household. That's my word. Just follow me. Go. With a new Frisian leader in place, maybe this was a turning point. God is on our side. It would be nice if you believe that too. Father. Father, we need to take it to the next step and continue north. No. Where are you going? Huh? Why don't you ever say anything? You're scared of us? Come on. No, no, no. Show us what you can do. Come on, big guy. Don't be shy. Huh? Come on. Speed the work up a bit. You want to go hunting? Let's go. This man is coming with us. Let's go hunting. I had a dream last night. Do you even have dreams? A man should think about his dreams. I dreamt I saw a fish. I saw the same fish in real life, it was a whale. Enormous beast. It was dying under its own weight. It was terrible to watch. But the fish in my dream, it didn't die. He sucked up all the water from the sea and all the fish were just floundering around on the seafloor as long as you could see. I think that means something. And I think it has to do with you. We found you alive on the beach. Have you ever wondered why you are still alive? Everything has a reason, silent one. Think about that. No, the tail. Oh, Frea. It's coming. It's time for new live. Listen up! I have a son. I have a son! Everything in its right place. Kendryck, you're a father. Everyone, fill up the horns! Let's celebrate. Next time it's you. Oh, here comes. Oh, my beautiful daughter. Well done. Well. Hey, over there. Ready, everybody. - Come on! Hurry up! - Come along, faster! Make room, make room. Come on. Make room, make room. Come on. The Sveads are coming. It's the Svear. They would plunder their own mothers house. Woden give us strength. Get ready! Go! Go! No, this is not your fight. You stay here. It will only bring bad luck. It's not your fight. You will not fight for us. Try and stop me. Come on. Loading. Pull. To the right. Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hold it, hold it. Fire. Fire - Go. - Fire. You're welcome. Retreat. The dream I had, all the fish were dead. You, silent one, you're the whale! - I killed more than him. - No, you did not. - I killed more than him. - No, you did not. Yes, I did. I saw you. My count was higher. - Why? - I am a better fighter than you are. Silent one, I always thought your arrival meant something, right? Something important. And I was right. This man is now free. You can have a piece of land. You can even have a family. Well, if anyone will have you. - Who wants that ugly one? - Yeah! Oh yeah, we need to find him a blind woman huh? A blind woman! You don't have to say yes. You don't even know my name. I see you. This belongs to you. You've had it all the time. Are you ready for this? You know I love you. Will you have her? Yes. It's an honor. My name is Frea daughter of Wiglek. My name is Redbad, son of Aldigisl. Let's celebrate! Make her happy. I will. Pepijn? - Pepijn? - The church. My church. What's going on? Godless heathen. Godless heathen! My church. He will punish! He will punish! Build another church, have it ready by the time I return. We'll have them do that. And this time made of stone. Yes, Father. Sit down, Drogo. Do exactly as we've agreed. My Lord. Perhaps you can tell me what terrible crimes that I have committed that you would do this to me? A house of God. Our people, are being exploited and abused. Is it so strange that they're revolting? I gave you the freedom to govern your own areas and collect part of my taxes. Our people don't even understand what taxes are. Let alone that they can pay such amounts. It's ridiculous. Your son should guard his tongue. We keep our promises. Keep your promises. I can't counsel a compromise with people who resist the true faith, who allow my churches to be set on fire. It's time you made a good example. How? You will see. You will see. I come on behalf of King Pepijn of Herstal. And I have a proposal to return peace to our peoples. The daughter of Aldigisl lives here. But, is she still a virgin? - We cannot give her away, can we? - Why not? This is a symbol of friendship from the Franks. We really need them. And have Sinde baptized against her will? She makes this sacrifice for the gods. We don't have a choice. Or do you want to start a war against the most powerful army in the world? - Redbad should have made this decision, not us. - Redbad is dead. Come on, boy. Accept this proposal. This is the moment to show that you're a decisive leader. Sea. Sea. Good? Stone. Stone? Ow! - Fot. - What? Voot? Foot. Foot. You. No. You? I. We. I have news from Frisian territory. The Frisian made a truce with the Franks by marrying off the daughter of king Aldigisl. It's not about you. And it's not about me. Where have you been all this time? What have they done to you? Get me out of here. I want to go home. Redbad! I cannot allow this to happen. It's Frankish territory now. It's teaming with soldiers down there. They won't recognize me. You're not exactly hard to recognize. She's my sister. Mmm. I cannot allow them to simply hand her over. You really want to rescue her from the Franks? I don't know, I don't have a plan. But I must try something. Then we go together. Hmm. Hey baby. It's time to say goodbye. Yeah. I love you. I love you. Oh God, I'm gonna miss you. Take good care of her. Give her a home like we have a home right here. We will come back. Please follow your heart. Go! Welcome. My grace. It's a great pleasure. Oh, your room is upstairs. Left, right, left, right. Left, right. Come on, Come on. Don't resist, don't resist. We better get you. Come on. ...de Vader, de Zoon en de Heilige Geest. Is this the bride? Let me see. We are accepting you into our family like a daughter. My daughter. You will sit at our dining table you will warm yourself by our hearth and you will sleep in our bed. You have no choice. You should realize, I don't extend a hand twice. I'm not afraid to die. Hmm. You do this in the name of that God of yours? Yes or no? Yes. No, no. That was unnecessary. You can't tell anyone. It's between you and I. Wait here. I'll be back soon. God, give me the power. On your knees. Come on. Kiss it. Kiss it! Relax, relax... Do you forsake the devil and all his works? Yes or no? Yes? Or no? Huh? Sinde. Who are you? Capture him. You. Say the Almighty Father. I believe in God, and his son, Jesus Christ. Do you forsake the heathen gods? Woden, Donar, Freya... Yes? The Almighty Father. Yes. And Jesus Christ, his son. You have been baptized. Well done, girl. Come, come, come. - Do you trust me? - Why? This is a good step, girl. You will see. You will see. Now. I must know who's responsible for this. What do you mean? Redbad? I've told you. No one between you and me. Who is this new ruler? There are some rumors, Father. Rumors? What rumors? Aldigisl's son. Redbad. But Redbad... Redbad is dead. Fairy tales. Nothing important. Maybe we should have never taken Dorestad. Shouldn't have taken Dorestad? Sometimes you think an idea is inspired by God but it's your pride, your ambition speaking. We will wait here, until after winter and I will make a decision. No, Father. We have to act now, and we have to act fast. And then the whole area up to the sea is for the taking. We need to call for extra troops. Now. - No. No! - Father. You spend time with your new wife. A happy woman bares more children. Redbad? Redbad, is that you? Gebbe. I... Where have you been? This is my wife, Frea. And this is my son, Poppo. Welcome, beauty. It's really you. You're back. Hey boys, bugger off. Get away. They think you've returned from Valhalla. Fenne. Hey. This is Frea, daughter of Wiglek. And my son, Poppo. You have a son. Yes. Welcome to our people, Frea. This is my husband, Wulf, son of Ragnak. We have prayed for you. Redbad. Look at you. I would like to know why Redbad is here. If I recall correctly, he was exiled. Exiled? I thought I was sacrificed. Then why has he not died? Perhaps Uncle Eibert fears that I want to take back my father's land. Upon which he now lives. Redbad. Stand up. This belongs to you. I welcome Redbad. And now? Now you intend to stay. I don't know. You cannot leave. You have only just arrived. You have married off my sister. And you let them baptize her. - We had good reasons. - Oh yes? Yes. A free person cannot be baptized against her will. Especially not the daughter of Aldigisl. Your brother. Everywhere I come, I see scared people. Dorestad was once a free city. Where everyone could go and do as they pleased. Where everyone could act freely, regardless of where they came from. And now? You have already brought ill fortune upon us once. Why would we listen to you now? Father! You let yourself be led by fear. What has happened to you all? This all feels very familiar, but, at the same time it's as if I don't recognize these people anymore. - You know, Fenne and I... - You don't have to say anything. I trust you. Why do you let your own kin treat you like this? You are your father's rightful heir. You look hurt every time you hear his name. Why? When I'm no longer here, I want you to help him. Can I trust you? Of course, Father. I know your pride. I know your anger. But he... He is the successor to the throne. And you, you, you are the son of a kitchen maid. Go ahead, drink. And get the rest you so long for. That's right. That's right, Father. Oh, good. Father wants the fourth army moved to Dorestad. You, what have you done? I would hurry if I were you. Go. Help me. I need a doctor! Help me. What have you done? I may not believe in heaven, but I know there's a hell, and you will rot in it. I'll kill you! No! No! Do you still remember? This is the North Star. This is us. This is the Moon. Planets move in fixed patterns. That's what you've taught me. You can calculate when the days become longer and when the Moon makes the tide strongest. Your father's time had come. His death was not your fault. Great changes are coming. Your father didn't fit into the New World. And you... You will have to adapt - to pave the way for future generations. - No. Jurre is king now. So you are no longer necessary? Everything is as it should be? Why did you come back? May Jesus Christ, through this holy anointment have... Ah... Ah, yes. Yes. Yes. Him. Him? Him? Him! - Him! - Him. Him. May Jesus... Drogo? Let him go. I am the mother of the crown prince, and therefore, the regent of the empire. Sit down, Drogo. Come on, boy. Come here. Where are you taking him? Drogo? Drogo? Drogo? Come hear it. A cart drove along an old road... - No, it's a sandy road. - Oh, I am sorry. ♪ A cart drove along a sandy road... ♪ Wait, wait, wait, this way I can hear you better. Like this. This is high. But you're not afraid, right? Yeah. Okay, I'll hold your hand. ♪ A cart drove along a sandy road ♪ The moon shone bright the road was wide ♪ A horse walked happily I'll bet it'll... ♪ ...asleep Swords up. Shields down. They are coming. - How near are they? - We don't know. We need Redbad. She is right. We cannot do this without Redbad. Go get Redbad, now. Why have you come? I was summoned by the King. - That means you have to listen to what I say. - You know me, don't you? Let's go! Wulf, Redbad, south side. The rest of you come with me, from the north. Let's go back. Formation! Turn! Hold! Turn! Shield! Wall! This is madness. We must retreat. Where is General Focard? I don't know, my Lord, he was just here. Looking for this? Damn him. Come, come, come. Come on. Get that man. The cavalry sir, we should stay together. Wait for my signal! Send the cavalry now. Cavalry in pursuit! Go! Hurry up! Move! Engage! Muur! Vuur! Archers! Wall! Fire! For Woden! It's high tide. Easy. Easy. Jurre! Jurre! This isn't working. We're being pushed back. There are too many of them. Odulf, protect Jurre! - We must retreat. - I won't surrender. - Let me go. - We don't stand a chance. Listen, boy. We must regroup. Where are my men? What are you doing? We must push on. Wall! Wall! Wall! Now! Charge! Now! We should retreat, my Lord. We have the upper hand! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! Redbad! A time will come when you have to show who's the leader. We seem to have a common problem. This Redbad. We have him under control. Redbad is rallying troops everywhere. They won't do anything without my son's orders. But does your son take orders himself? Of course. Really? I want Redbad eliminated, and then I can return home. But... But who would govern Dorestad? I'll gladly leave that to a loyal, deputy. - I... - You don't have to say anything. Now they're clinging on to their gods even more. Now more than ever. Oh, you understand them? They just keep on believing. What good does it do? Something to hold on to, Redbad. Something to hold on to. That Jesus of yours is not much better. - Oh? - All those massacres in his name. It's not Jesus who does that. What do you think these people will do when they find out that I'm a Christian? Perhaps we should return to your family. And abandon your people? What does your heart say? Fear. - For what? - For what others see in me. You've just said it yourself. These people deserve better. A better leader. How can I lead these people when I don't even know what I believe in? You believe the gods do nothing. But they have sent you, Redbad. I don't believe in that nonsense. True leaders take power. By force. Frea says you should always... Frea knows what she believes in. Yes. In the God of the Christians. No, in you. Frea believes in you. Why are you not doing that to yourself? Or do you believe that Jurre will save this people? Come on, Redbad. It is not about rituals or customs. Or about cloaks or fibulas. It is about what's in here. Your love for Frea and Poppo. For your father. For your country. That is what gives you strength. And that is what people see in you. You keep coming here with questions. But you already know the answers. You just have to want to hear them. - I don't have much time. - I'm not here for that. You want me to baptize your son, don't you? My husband is not a Christian. My husband is Redbad. Redbad? Then it is especially important that I baptize him as soon as possible. You cannot force people to become Christians. Jesus says you should love your enemies. Without reluctance or compulsion. For God loves a cheerful giver. If the people would only engage in conversation with us they would start to see that we Christians even treat our enemies... The way you're doing it now will only provoke more war. Is that what you want? Not me. But to convince Willibrord that... Talk to him. Talk to him, and let him convince Charles. Otherwise, it will be a massacre. Do you want that on your conscience? All right. I will try my best. We must continue. We must push on now. Should we attack? At least that way we'll gain the initiative. We don't have a choice. We must free Dorestad. You want to attack the most powerful army in the world, and defeat it. Yes. We'll do it together. I've spoken to a priest. I've asked you not to intervene. I can get through to him. Priests have blood on their hands. They cannot be trusted. Is that really what you want? To solve everything with the sword? The sword does not lie. That's the only thing I believe in. Then you're exactly what they name you. A barbarian. But that's not who you are. Redbad. How is Frea? Is she manageable? You know her. Is she afraid of dying? What is your plan? How many ships can you bring to Dorestad before the next full moon? Enough. Why by the next full moon? Leave some Franks for us. Yeah. - It will be all right. - I know. I wish I could find the words to keep you here, Father. I wish I could find the words to convince you to come with me. Father... There have to be other ways to convert them. Those barbarians only speak one language. And yet, they are people. Just like you and me. If you would only talk to them. You are a good boy. But if you can only see the good in people then you will often be so disappointed in the end. My son. Stop it! No, not our sacred oak! Stop! Stop! Music! If this thing, this tree, if it is so sacred, then why does Donar not hurl a thunderbolt from the sky to kill me? Why, huh? Why? Why? Come on. Donar! Come on! Come on, here I am! See? Nothing at all. Nothing... Superstition. Nothing but superstition. You don't have to sacrifice people. Jesus... Jesus has sacrificed himself. For all of us! A platoon of Franks is cutting down the sacred oak. They have Christian priests with them. Wulf. You stay here with the troops. Tomorrow you'll lead them to Dorestad. With or without me. Gebbe. Come. Come. Stop! Stop this madness! - Stay back! - Stop this madness! Come on, come on! No! They cannot destroy our world. They cannot destroy our world. You know who you are. Forward! Attention! I know who's to blame for this. Redbad's wife. She is a Christian. That is ridiculous. I have seen her conspire with the priests. She was praying in one of their churches. Redbad, tell them that this is nonsense. She has nothing to do with it. She is to blame for all of it. So she's a Christian? It's not about what you believe. It's about what you do with it. Give us Redbad and his wife, and we will leave you alone. Fenne. It's no use. Let's leave in peace. We won't hurt you. Take the three of them. And take down that Pagan tree. He does bring luck, that God of yours. It's not about luck. Or about God making life easier for people. Then what good does it do? Jesus said you should love your enemies. He must've been crazy. Jesus knew he had been betrayed to the Romans. And yet he let himself be captured, and be killed. Why? He wanted to show his friends that he loved them. You still love him. I could never have given him a child. Perhaps it just had to be this way. You have betrayed Redbad. - Oh, yes, have I? - You have betrayed me! I have saved our people from a huge defeat. A defeat? Everyone is ready. The Danes are just off the coast. Let them stay there. Father... We can still catch up to them. Do you want to free Redbad? Is that what you really want? We arrange this with Charles Martel. For the first time we are powerful enough to defeat the Franks. Are we? And who will lead that attack? Go, then. Go to them. And tell them we're going to play soldiers. Because you feel you must prove yourself. Make one mistake, and they'll torture you alive. You don't stand a chance. Not even if you were a hundred times better than Redbad. You just never considered that I could be a good leader. That I would be able to lead our people to victory. That I could be like... Why are you not supporting me? Tell the Danes we no longer need them. We're going to Utrecht. To negotiate with Charles Martel. Halt. No, no. No, don't touch him. - Give him to me! - No! No! Stop! Please! Please! Stop! Give him to me! No! Poppo! Redbad? Redbad? How cozy. A family reunion. Redbad! I wanted to get a closer look at the man who everybody talks about. The great Redbad. We have to give the people what the people want. Nice fairy tales about heroes, and dark fairy tales about God. Hmm. Our fathers believe that, while we don't, so let's keep that a secret. For us, it doesn't matter what's up there, because around here, we rule, and we do as we please. Maybe we do. Or maybe our fathers understood something we still have yet to learn. But that's the problem, isn't it? You're too smart to really believe that. So... just play along, and I'll let you live. Oppose me and I'll kill you and your cute little family. Understood? Redbad, do you forsake the devil and all his works? Do you forsake the Pagan gods, Woden, Donar, Freya... Yes or no? Huh? Yes. Then step into the water, and I shall baptize you in the name of the Holy Spirit. On your knees. On your knees. Do you believe in the one true God? The Almighty Father, and his son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit? Yes or no? Do you believe in that one true God? In the Almighty Father, and his Son? Throw away everything that unites our people? Our traditions, our practices, our customs? Yes or no? Yes? Or no? Huh? Do you believe in that one true God? The Almighty father... I've given you every opportunity to be the leader you want to be. ...and in the Holy Spirit? Yes or no? Redbad, it's not about you, and it's not about me. It's about our people, and the interest of our nation. Now stand up, Redbad. Rise. Yes or no? Will I go to heaven then? Just answer my question. You want to baptize me, so then will I go to heaven? Every good Christian will go to heaven. - Do you believe in... - And my ancestors? What about your ancestors? Will I see them in heaven if I'm baptized? My own father? Your father was not baptized. But I will see him in heaven, right? He was not a Christian. But he was a good person. A brave man, who gave his life for his people. He was a heathen! He was a heathen! And heathens do not go to heaven. They cannot. It's impossible. And Sietse, son of Boed? Hille, son of Reider? Maike, daughter of Taeke? Your fathers, your sons, your daughters, all honorable men and women, who died for their people. Is there a place for them in Christianity? You can pray for their souls. Yes or no? No. - Yes or no? - No, of course not. Why would I convert to such a religion, then? Why don't you grab him. so thought I could break his will and get him baptized. Our fathers may not have been gods, but they were our fathers. Yes! And I would rather be in hell with my friends, than in Heaven with my enemies. Yes! Redbad! Come with me now. We're leaving for Dorestad. Attack! For Redbad! Jurre! Jurre! Let's go! Jurre! - Let's go! - No! We should've done this a long time ago. No. No. This truly belongs to you. Hey. It belongs to us.

May the Lord be with you. Amen. Don't you want to wait for the light? Is everyone ready? What now? We wait just a little while longer. He knows what he's doing. Usually. Torches. Fire up. Redbad, we don't stand a chance without the Danes. We have little choice. What do you want to do? - Straw? - Everything's ready. A sign from God! Redbad, what's happening? Stay in line. On the formation. - It's an ill omen. - Yes, but for whom? Oh, God... It's the fifth full moon of the year. You knew this was going to happen. Idwina. Warriors! Is this a sign? Perhaps. Is it an ill omen? It might be. Are we going to die today? Probably. But I know one thing for certain. We won't let anyone tell us how to live our lives, or what we should believe. No king, no priest, not even the Sun or the Moon. Because this is the land of free people, who bow to no one. This is the land of our ancestors. Of the people we love. That's what unites us. And no one can take that from us. So if you want to live freely, or die freely, then follow me! Redbad! Formation. Break your line. Formation. Stay in line. Stay! Get ready. Open the gate.
