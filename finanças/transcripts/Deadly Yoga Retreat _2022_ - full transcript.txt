Wow! Race you to the top? Umm... How is someone who lives on the 30th floor afraid of heights? I don't go near the windows. I'll meet you in the water. Okay. Come up here! It's beautiful! I can't hear you, babe! Jump down to me! What? Erica! Behind you! Erica! Erica! No! Erica! Hey! This is a pleasant surprise. The professor didn't show. I didn't get the email until I'd already left, so... Hmm. Hey, you look off. I'm fine! I realized this morning that it's been a year since I taught my last class. You mean yoga? I thought that was just a hobby, for fun? I thought so, too. But, lately, I... You're right. I'm off. I just feel so off-balance. Like I can't focus. My anxiety comes in waves and... I don't even recognize myself when I look in the mirror. Hey, do you want to drop out of law school and go back to teaching yoga full-time? No. Well, okay. I'm out of ideas. I wasn't asking for a solution. I was just sharing how I feel. Oh... I'm sorry you're feeling bad, babe. Maybe go see Dr. Horner? Yeah. I have some work to finish up, and then I think maybe I will. Ooh, I got to go to work. I love you. Love you. I applied five times when I was teaching, and nothing. And out of nowhere, I get an invite? I mean, of course this happens when I'm in law school. Pat, this retreat, people say it's life-changing. Remington morrow is a genius. Hmm. It's one week. - I think... - Okay. If I get all my work done... Did you just say okay? Honey, you haven't been yourself for a month. I love you. I also love the woman that I married. I miss her. If Remington Steele here can help make that happen, I say let's buy a plane ticket tonight, okay? We have miles. Hey! Hello? Thank you. Iz! Pam? Hey! Oh, thank goodness it's you. I thought I just snapped my finger in front of a stranger! It's been forever. I know! God, this place, it's like they reached into my dreams for the blueprints. Well, let's go get you checked into that dream of yours. Hey, are you still with Peter? Patrick, and yes. How about you, are you still with Craig? Oh, god, no! That was, like, two husbands ago. I'm currently free and easy if anyone asks. Especially him. Well, that was certainly a moment. Yeah, he's very charismatic. That's one word for it. He looked right at you. I heard he's intense. I'll say. You're sweating. You know, sometimes things just don't work out. You get bored and you cheat. We are so damn lucky we got in. I've been applying for years. Me too! And I don't know why this is the year. I mean, I'm not even teaching. Law school. Longtime dream kind of turned into a nightmare. Don't they all. Forget about real life. We're in paradise. This is going to be an amazing week. Yeah. Mm, which if we don't make it to orientation, it's going to be over before it starts. Well, it's okay if we're a few minutes late. Read your welcome packet. It mentions tardiness, like, 900 times. Well, then, let's go! Everyone looks so cute! I know! Where did you get that? Oh! No! Part of why we're here is to get away from technology, and here I am... no, I'll never ask you to do something I wouldn't do myself. The theme of this year's retreat... Look inward. Sounds like a yogi greeting card, huh? Sometimes the things that are most obvious are the hardest things to see. I've spent a lot of time looking inward, and it is so hard to see ourselves. Because we put masks on, don't we? Yes. For our friends, our spouses. Even ourselves. These next few days will be about confronting who we really are, the good and the bad, regardless of how difficult it is. And it will be difficult. And I will have exacting goals for each of you. And some of you will fail to meet those goals, and those who do will be asked to leave. Immediately. You're here because I've had my eye on you and I think you have potential. But don't be surprised if one of your own suddenly disappears one morning. It's all part of the process. And part of the reason these retreats are so exclusive. So! If you haven't already, unpack. Take a nap, unwind, breathe in this fresh, beautiful ocean air. Because tonight at 4:00 P.M. we meet right back here... And the journey begins. Namaste. I'm not sure I like the idea that one of us could get kicked out at any moment. They give the same speech in law school. He's not going to kick anybody out. Well, let's not give him a reason to kick either of us out. Sure, honey. You have to ask yourself, what is my relationship with pain. Do you run from it? But, if you can make pain your friend, your ally... walk next to pain instead of having it in your path... that is where the true magic lies. Adho mukha shvanasana. Extend your arms. Left leg higher. Release! Hey, are you doing okay? He wants to see me. Ooh, that can't be good. Or maybe it is good! Who's to say? Look, he's not going to cut anybody on the first day. I'm Isabella and this is Pam. I'm Nina. We're all going to laugh about this at tomorrow's morning session. Sure. I'll see you there. Okay. It'd be easier to pity her if she didn't look like a supermodel. Come. You wanted to see me? Oh, I've already seen you, Nina. See, this is why we don't judge a book by itS cover. You look at the abs, the cuts in the arms, the way the thighs curve up towards the waist and you think, my god, she's built for this. But you're not, are you? I am. I will be. I'll work harder. Will you, though? Are you really willing to do anything to stay here? I was married, once. I find it conflicts with what we're trying to achieve here. Maybe that's why you had such a hard time today. I don't think that's it. Oh, so worried. So jumpy! Am I really that scary? No, not at all. No, not at all. See? I'm not scary, see? I'm not scary. Okay? Remy, I'm sorry. I love my husband. Your husband is a lucky man. And I am sorry if I overstepped. Want one? No, really, I’m allergic to shellfish. Huh. Imagine that. And you filled out your medical questionnaire and the dietary restrictions form for the retreat, right? I did. And I carry an Epi-pen with me because of it. I know. Jeffrey, I just got to my office. There's been a terrible accident. Come quick. Well, hi. How's it going? It's ah... That good or that bad? Intense. Well, that's never bothered you before. And now don't tell me we moved heaven and earth for you to have a Meh experience. No, no, it's not a Meh experience. Life-changing was the promise, right? There's still time. I'm just, uh... I'm just tired. Well, I miss my wife. You okay? Yeah, I just, I... I'm excited for you to be back home. Get some sleep. Okay. I love you. Night. The goal is to make sure that none of the retreat is affected. Or the fellow attendees, the hotel, staff and guests. But, of course, the retreat is our top priority. Good. I'd hate to have to find another resort. Remy... There is, of course, the question as to what to tell the family. And what's wrong with the truth? What was Nina doing in your office? Are you forgetting about me? S-sir? I did everything I could to save her. I nearly broke her ribs trying to dislodge that... And you want me... me... To deal with this now while I have a class waiting? How dare you? That doesn't look like a very pleasant conversation. Have you ever dealt with a hotel manager? Hey, notice anything? It's still early. She'll come. She's not coming, iz. I told you. That guy does not mess around. It's weird. It's exclusive. That's why a certification at Remy morrow's retreat actually matters. Maybe. Ah, the small details of running a retreat. Sometimes I don't even know why I bother. But then... I see all of you. And I remember why my efforts are worth it. Child's pose. Let's begin. Oh, literally every part of my body hurts right now. What is your relationship to pain? Do you run from it? When I look at all of you, I remember why this is worth... Is that really what I sound like? No, I was just... May I? Sure! It's okay, I'm nothing special. Destroying the ego is part of the curriculum, remember? So, it's just that I’m... so, so, me... We don't want to be sent home. I was watching both of you today. And even though your form wasn't perfect, I didn't see anything too embarrassing. You have nothing to worry about. Am I really that intimidating? No, not at all. Of course, you are. You said girls would be getting sent home, and one already has. Why would we not be questioning everything? Question? Whether or not we're good enough? Oh, you know, I consider myself an impeccable judge of character. Earlier today when I saw you, I thought to myself, now, there's someone special. There is a woman willing to speak her mind, to scaling the plains of complete understanding and achieving the privilege of deserving it. Which, in itself, is rare. Mm. Maybe it's something I need to work on. Being more open. And vulnerable. I thank you for this. The last thing I would ever want is for someone to feel unwelcome. And I can assure you... No one who leaves won't be undeserving. And everyone who stays... Will be quite deserving. Okay, that was really steamy. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh... My Isabella, I'm so rare and deserving. Stop! Oh! Don't tell me you didn't get electric shocks up your arm just then! You're being silly. I'm... I'm being jealous! If he even looked in my direction, I'd be going home ashamed and happy. I'm married. Why would he look at me when he has all the other girls? Have you ever met a member of the male species? They all want what they can't have. As we flow, connect with your breath. You feel it, don't you? The physics of this room collect and hold onto the heat. Hold it. This is not your standard hot yoga. Release. Continue. But we want that extra pain, don't we? We welcome it. The goal is to unleash the goddess within, the greatness within. Greatness feeds on adversity. You can't nourish a goddess with platitude. She needs to digest pain. Hey, I really think you need some water. I'm fine. Oh... Remy! Is everything okay? Does everything look okay? She needs a hospital. Call an ambulance. Now. Did you see the way he picked her up? Like she didn't weigh a thing. You guys don't think this is his fault? How is it his fault, iz? Yeah, I mean, she pushed herself. It was her choice! No, it's the atmosphere. If she didn't feel like she could say anything or take a break because she doesn't want to get kicked out. I mean, we all saw what happened to Nina. No, Nina couldn't cut it. And I'm not going to blame Remy for having high standards. Especially if we aren't the ones failing to meet them. Well, either way, I liked seeing him help her. Maybe I'll fake a heat stroke next session. Well, that's good news. Back up and okay in no time. She's gone. She won't be coming back to any of the sessions. But she was just dehydrated. She was weak. You don't raise the average by letting the losers stay. She's gone. Hello. You know, of all my students, you're the most wary of me. Not wary, just married. Please, I have two rules, never with a student and never with a married woman. That's two nevers. May I? So... So, I won't take up too much of your time. It's just... Pam told me you won't be joining us at the party tonight. Yeah, I’m here for training. So, if we get a night off, I'm going to let my body rest. Oh, believe me, your body is the most important thing. But you really don't want to miss tonight. I don't have anything except for yoga clothes to wear. These are small problems. You really don't take no for an answer, do you? It's one of my virtues. Or vices. Depends on how you look at it. Just say you'll think about it. Fine, I will think about it. Yes, success! I didn't say yes. You didn't say no. So, tell your husband I left like a meek little mouse. See, look, I'm not even touching you. Go! Get out of here. I won't say a word, but tell me everything! Sometimes policy interferes with my desires. I was told I had to leave. Yes. And that came from you, right? I wish it could be different. I put my whole life on hold to come here. I want to stay. What exactly in your life did you have to put on hold? Your mother's dead and your father likes the bottle more than you. I don't have to... Yes, you do. You want out of your stifling cubicle. You believe you have more to offer this world than the unfortunate hand that you've been dealt. I mean, that's what you wrote, isn't it? What more can you offer? What more can you offer me? What, nothing to tell? I've had a lot of men leave my hotel my room... I mean, a lot... and I know a happy camper when I see one. He just came to ask me to go to the party. What? I mean, I off-handedly mention that you might not come to the party and he skips up seven flights of stairs and begs you? I mean, it's adorable. I hate you. Mrs. Miller... Compliments of Mr. Morrow. From our resort collection. Thank you. Wow. Oh my god. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, yoga's not the only thing you can teach. I've got to get back to the party. Okay. I'll just get the sand off of me and meet you there? The party is for registered guests only. Well, I’m... But your efforts are commendable. My efforts? But the sum of your parts is nowhere near where they need to be to join the group. You bastard! Men like you think you're untouchable. But you know what? We're alone. This entire beach is a closed door, and no one knows what happens behind closed doors. You're not untouchable! You assaulted me. You forced me to have sex with you. You're finished. Are you? Finished? Oh, I'm just getting started, Remy. Same. Ugh. To Lahaina... Lahaina Luna. Where the mountains are green you will find me in Lahaina... Lahaina Luna. Hey! Well, don't you look like 10 million bucks. Hey, please don't... Tell anybody? Never. Did I make a mistake? Accepting a gift like this? It's not 1955. He needed you here, you needed the dress, it's fine. I'll be your chaperone. Girls. Lahaina Luna. In Lahaina... Lahaina Luna. I'm so glad you all made it here tonight. I was afraid you were going to be too tired. Each year I pick a few of my most promising students to go into the mountains with me for an adventure. It's yoga under the stars. It's meditation in the mountains. It's beauty inside... And beauty outside. This year I've chosen four of you to join me, the most we've ever had. Lisa. Everly. Pam. And Isabella. Congratulations. That's why he needed you here. We're in! Congrats, girl. So, wait, it's just the five of us? I don't know. But if I have it my way, we're only going to need four tents. We're going to need a couple of bottles of champagne. And what do you little girls want? And the rest of you will enjoy the lovely amenities of the resort until we return. So, after the diagnosis, it was hard for me to do anything. If I only had one lung, I wouldn't move a muscle. Are you kidding? It was hard, but I wanted to move. Yoga's always been such an important part of my life. So, I figured, half as many lungs means working twice as hard. Mm-hmm. Amen to that. Cheers to that. How about you, girl? How did you get here? Yeah, it can't be just to look hot, right? No! Really? You know, part of being body positive is accepting good bodies, too. Right? Yes, of course it is. Why, what are you here for? Spiritual fulfillment? Look... You know what? I think that Pam and I are here for the same reason. Oh? Mm-hmm. And what's that? Excuse me. Uh, we're here because there's something missing at home. All of my favorite people all at one table. I knew the winners would naturally find each other. May I? There's a seat right here, sir. Oh... You can call me Remy. I mean, when you earn a sir from me, you get a sir from me. Secrets? The only secret I'm interested in is how you got these forearms. This can't be just from yoga and genetics, can it? They look amazing! Hey, can I just steal you for a few minutes? I have some questions about today's lesson. Sure, we can go talk in my office. Or in my room. Umm, come on. The dress looks beautiful on you. Ah, thank you. Well, they took my lung but, apparently, they got her dignity. Did, did you mean that? What? When you said that I was looking for something. Oh! You mean why we're here? Mm. I just said that so you wouldn't get in a fight with everly. But are you? Looking for something? Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, I am. What? Clarity. Who? No. Like, like the concept. Like, clarity! Clarity. I, I love my husband. Got to love your husband. And I love, I love my job. Good! And I love my future. I, I don't love my life. Oh, got to love your life. Why don't I love my life? Hmm? But why? I mean, do I have to change something? But why do you change something if there's nothing, if nothing's wrong? That's why I'm here. This is, this, that's why I came here. I came here for clarity. Pam, I... Iz? It's 5:00 A.M. here. Hey. You okay? What are you wearing? I'm outside. In a dress. I can see that. Maybe you should go to bed, honey. I'm looking for something. And what's that? Clarity. Yeah, I know. Why don't I love my life? I don't know how you want me to answer that. Good night, Patrick. I love... Oh... You haven't been hung over in a really long time, have you? How are you even functioning? Practice. Here. You're going to want a cold shower. Drink that in there, we're leaving in 20. Do you remember last night? The good parts. I called my husband and I... And what? You know what? You can tell me on the way up to the mountain. I really hope you don't, though. Oh, looks like we beat what's her face, "Evilyn." Everly, and she's not coming. Wait, why? I don't know. She sent word to the front desk this morning before I woke up. Maybe a spot opened up on a reality show. So, you didn't actually talk to her? No, but she's done this before. Last year in Fiji she went home early because her boyfriend was lonely or something. She flakes sometimes. Good morning, ladies! What a beautiful day! I hope you're ready to get closer to heaven. Now, I've taken the Liberty of packing your individual hiking packs, complete with tents and water bottles. Make no mistake, this is going to be the most difficult trek of your life. And as much as I hate the addiction, if you need to use those horrible little devices to make any calls, do it now. Because up there... Is mystery, wisdom, spirit, romance. But no cell service. Uh... Sorry, I'll just be one minute. There's always one. Hi, hon! I see you got the hangover glasses on. Oh, uh... Yeah, I called you last night. Oh yes, yes, you did. Well, I hope I didn't say anything... You were in a place. I don't know what place, but it happens. Hey, listen, every year they do this exclusive thing where they take a few girls up to the mountains and do some special sessions. Anyway, there's not going to be reception, so I just want to let you know I'll call you tomorrow. Sounds good. I hope you find some clarity up there. We talked about that last night, didn't we? We did. And I... Have mine. Isabella, we're ready! I got to go, pat. Sounds like the big man needs you. Is that your better half? Uh... Ha-ha, Patrick! Hey, Remington. It's nice to meet you. Isabella speaks so highly of you. Well, Isabella is the ultimate example of who and what I'm looking for. I feel the same way, actually. Do you? That's wonderful to hear. She's told you about our upcoming expedition, I take it? Yes, the mountain. Exactly. I'll take good care of your wife. Nothing to worry about here. I, uh, appreciate that. Time to say goodbye. Okay. Well, I love you and I'll... Whatever that was... It stays here. Ladies! Let the adventure begin! Let's go. We're getting closer to the stars. That might sound crazy, but every step we take is peeling away a layer of the stifling world that's attached to us. Breathe in that mountain air, that electricity. That is all from above. I really want to believe everything he just said, but all I'm hearing is less oxygen. This next move is called ujjayi pranayama, the ocean's breath. The purpose of this move is to calm the righteous heart, to let you see beyond what's in front of you. To unlock healing... Even when you want to shut the world out. It's just you and me in this moment. I hope you can see why I brought you here. I hope you can feel it. I can. Good. It's all about you. And that... Is ujjayi pranayama. Okay, so here's a question that's been on my mind. How the hell do you sit there so relaxed after that hike and yoga today? I mean, your endurance must be incredible. I don't allow for anything to be in my life that I don't want to be there. I chose not to be tired, so I'm not. You know, in law school we would call that a non-answer. Do you think I'm lying? I just don't think you answered the question. You caught me. I get tired like everybody else. But I do believe in willing a feeling away. The conscious mind is so much more powerful than we give it credit for. I don't like for there to be weakness in my life, failure, so I will it away the best I can. So far, it's suited me pretty well. So, is that why you do this? This? The yoga, the teaching, the retreat? When I was young, my father left my mother. She had her issues. She moved in with her boyfriend at the time... Who then became her dealer. I confronted him and told him to stop giving my mom drugs. I was 12, an idealist. He beat me unconscious, and when I woke up my mom told me I shouldn't upset him like that again. I learned two very valuable lessons that night. Strength comes from within and weakness is all around. So, focus on the strength, eliminate the weakness. So, what happened to him? The boyfriend? He died in a horrible car accident. Drunk driving. Or... Some other kind of driving. But here I am focusing on the ugly past when there is so much beauty all around us. So much... Beauty. I think I’m going to go to bed. So soon? Yeah, long night last night, and even longer day. So, I'll see you all in the morning. Yes. Oh... Yes, oh... Yes. Yes. What are you doing here? Shhh. You want me here. No. No? I saw your face. You want me here. I don't. You are a goddess. The moment I saw you, I knew exactly what you were doing here. You're missing something out of your life and you want it to be fulfilled. I'm married. What are the bonds of law when spirits want to bond. Please stop. You don't want me to stop. You want to be held. You want to be taken. You want to be owned. You want to be worshiped. You want clarity. I think I just found it. No, this... This isn't what I want. You found clarity. Yeah. I love my life. Your life is nothing. Your life could be so much more. You're mistaking clarity for weakness. Kind of feels like strength. We can discuss this further. Not in this tent we won't. I'm truly sorry if I misunderstood your intention. I usually have a better grasp at what women want from me. We'll just chalk this up to a misunderstanding, then. But it will be the last. The very last. That's the worst ending to a fairytale I've ever heard. Pam! We all saw the way you were looking at him. I was not looking. Yeah, you were! Listen, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. I was married, too. But what I do know is that you don't get too many opportunities in life to experience real passion. So, if you don't want him, I'll take him! As many times as I can. Life isn't about supposed-to, iz. Yeah, it's not about running, either. And a night with Remy, that's running. Now, I'm going to finish out the week, go home to Patrick, and whatever issues we have we'll work them out. Hmph. There was something else, too. There always is. When I told him no, I saw a glimpse of something. A glimpse? Of what? Rage. I'm not interested in glimpses, iz. I want the whole show. You kill me, girl. What happened here? Hikers die here all the time. Way more than the brochures tell you. Dangerous terrain... If you don't know where to step. Enticing, isn't it? Not even a little bit. Fear of heights? Just not particularly fond of them. Fear is a manifestation of the mind. Just like no, it can be overcome. Fear can also lead you down the right path. Fear can also be a good thing. Just like no. Gold was a huge industry here in the 1800s. This land is rich for so many reasons. We must respect the land, the water, the earth, for we are all connected, we are all one. Respect. It says don't touch. Onward! We are halfway to the peak. Halfway to achieving total consciousness! Up here, there is nothing between us and the gods. The zenith, the pinnacle. Yes, the air is thin. Yes, it is harder to breathe. But that is because you are so much stronger than oxygen itself. You thrive where it struggles. And you achieve that through hard work, and you only get to stay through harder. Look inward. This next move is sagaar Ka motee. The ocean's Pearl? It is the ultimate test in balance. Your environment is unbalanced, but your soul must be. That'll be all. Savasana. Lisa! I have no Patience for unprepared in my class. Get your breathing under control. That's lunch. Calling your husband? Yes, I am. I thought I told you to leave that at the bottom of the hill. Iz, come on, the whole point of being up here is to get away from the world. She'll never get service. Some people just don't understand. And some people do. How long is lunch? As long as we want it to be. Hey, are you okay? Fine. Maybe we should go get you some water. All right. All right, can we take it slow? Of course. Okay. Sit down, okay? Here. We head down the mountain tomorrow. Our journey has almost come to an end. Where's Pam? I'll say this about your friend, she is not saddled by the same fears that keep you weak. She's fully committed to the process. She's an angel. She doesn't know me. You do. You just proved it down there, to everyone and yourself. Lisa! The two of you go back to the peak and look for a signal. But you said... Now! Oh, little girl with one lung, how I planned on making a spectacle of you when we got down the mountain. But, we plan, god laughs. Oh, this whole thing is just going to be so, so messy now. I might have to take a few years off after this one. This is useless. It might not be, okay? But he said it was! You can both stop. She's... Dead? How!? The air, her lungs, the work. I did everything I could. You sent us out here! To get a signal. You said there was no possibility of getting a signal. We laughed about it when we were in the woods! I thought there might be. Wait a minute, you just wanted us away from her. I wanted all of us to help. I don't believe you. I think iz is right about you. Right about me? Isabella, whatever could she mean? And we just... God, you are disgusting! Pam. You don't know what you're doing, do you? Walk over to me, Pam. I have one superpower, and that's knowing when a man is over his head. And, buddy, you could swim 70 feet straight up and still be under it! Pam, stop. No, I'm not done. We are headed down this mountain without you! And when we get back to civilization, we're going right to the authorities. That's enough! Now I'm done. No! Run all you want! Run from your life! Isabella! Hah! Wow, what a throw! You know, I've spent 20 years going up and down this mountain! I've hunted it for 20 years, too! Babe, you really should come to me! I truly don't want to hurt you! I mean, I let you live last night in the tent! Do you have any idea what that means? Run all you want! Run from your life. You can't run from me. I'll find you! You know the others are meaningless, right? Distractions. But you, ha-ha! You have got strength inside you! Like me. And we need to explore what that means, together. This is really disappointing, Isabella! Isabella! The only way for you to get out of here with your sad little life still inside of you is if you give me what I want! I don't like being denied, Isabella. Been denied my whole life. And I have found the only way you really get what you want, you really achieve it, is if you take it. I'm not going to give you anything. She stopped running. You do what you need to do and I'll do what I need to do. So, is that a yes? You know, it's such a shame you won't get to experience me, Isabella. It unlocks a door within your soul, just the pure pleasure of it. I would say to ask your friend Pam, but... Oh! Keeping cool even in the face of death? That's what I saw in you! That's it, I knew it! Yes! I was right! Oh, but you were, you were too weak to let me in. You were too weak to let go. That's the problem. All the women I've told to look inward, they all want to know the same thing. They want to know, Remy, what am I supposed to see? Want to know the truth? You want to know what they're supposed to see, huh? Do you want to? Yeah, I want to know. I don't know. I literally have no clue. All I know is that these desperate women want so bad for their desperate little lives to feel a little less sad and a little less little. And you have nothing inside. Hey, Remy? Huh? I looked inside. Oh yeah? Yeah. What did you see? Clarity. Iz. Patrick? Hey. What happened? Are you okay? How are you here? I love you. Did you find what you were looking for? I did. Let's go home.
