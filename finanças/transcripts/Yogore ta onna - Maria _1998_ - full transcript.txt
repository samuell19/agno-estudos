Dirty Maria Straight on. -All right. l'm tired. Where are you going? l told you to drive straight on. Yes, sir. Hey, driver. Do you know S&M? -Yeah. Have you ever tried it? -No, l haven't. l went to the telephone dating club with somebody else's wife today. Married women are amazing these days. Just amazing. This woman, she was into S&M. lt's rather peculiar, that stuff. But it's really nice. Please get out, sir. Why? We're not there yet. l don't want any money. Please get out of my cab. What's wrong? Are you refusing to drive me? l don't feel up to it today. l'm sorry. What's wrong with you? Hello. l'm sorry, it's a little... At seven? All right. Please go ahead. l'm back. Welcome back. How about some stew? -Okay. l got one. One from 1 958. Are you looking out for them? -You mean the glittery ones, right? The smooth ones from 1 989 will do too. -Right. Good morning. Sorry l'm late. lt's all right. Sawai? -Yes. ls this sales slip yours? Yes. Did Mayumi come to collect her wages yesterday? Yeah, she came. Maybe it's none of my business... but be a little more discreet about your affair with Sawai. There's nothing between Sawai and me. Really? -Sawai is involved with Mayumi. You said they were having an affair. -Well, that may be what l told you. But she doesn't work here any more. We don't need that today. Deeper, deeper. Hey, how about going to a spa? We first met at a spa, didn't we? Let's split up. lt's over. l'm thinking about changing jobs. Are you going to Mayumi's salon? -Are you still suspicious of me? Why is it then? -l just don't like it. They're gossiping behind my back. l'm off. -Have a good day. This is the Murakami residence. We're not here to take your call. Please leave a message. Number 1 1 to lkebukuro, please. Number 1 1 to lkebukuro. l got that, 268. Please come in, 275. 275? 27 5? Please report, 275. 27 5? You're overdue. What's happened, 275? This is car 275. l'd like to carry on from here. Are you all right? l can't explain it to you right now. -Roger. Please proceed. Please listen to me. Let go of me. l don't know anything about it. Please let me have Mayumi back. -l have nothing to do with it. What are you up to? -l know you slept with Mayumi. Does it hurt? No. Did Mayumi go straight home after collecting her wages? Yeah. Did she say anything about going away? -No. l see. Thank you. Thank you for your hospitality. l'll have to report her missing. She could have been the victim of a crime. Take care. And now our next news item. Early this morning human flesh was found in a black plastic bag... in a dumpster next to an apartment building in Tama. The woman who found the bag contacted the police. The bag contained a woman's right arm. At the moment only the right arm has been found. The rest of the body... Maybe this has nothing to do with it... What? We went skiing with people from the salon. There was a spa there. Mayumi seemed to like the place. She said she'd like to go back there again. Did she now? l remember she went on a company trip. On that day she did say she was going to the spa. lt's cold. -Yes. That's because it's winter. l know something. -What would that be? This is hard for you as her husband... but Mayumi had an affair with one of our colleagues. With the proprietor, right? That's not all. There was a rumour she was having an affair with a young hairdresser. With a hairdresser? Yeah. He also left the salon when Mayumi did. But it's just rumours. Maybe she's gone there with that guy. lt's really cold. My bottom almost froze. Are you all right? ls it far? We'll get there soon. l remember this area. ...a human right arm in a black garbage bag. A waste disposal company found a left ankle. Do you want to rest a little longer? -No, let's go. Shall we go back? -No, let's wait a little longer. Mr Murakami. Mr Murakami. l'm all right. l'm sorry. l haven't slept in two or three days. l'll go and have another look. What are you doing? -Nothing. That's it. We've run out of petrol. You killed Mayumi, didn't you? You killed Mayumi. l know you did. You even tried to kill me. l saw it all. You did it, didn't you? lt felt good hiding it from your husband, didn't it? You people just do whatever you like. That feels good, doesn't it? l knew about it, but l said nothing. Because l'm just useless. l thought it was fine if we were at peace. l put up with it all that time. Night after night. l didn't do it because l liked it. You people... Excuse me. Excuse me. Are the phone lines down because of the snow? Yeah. l'll get the police here tomorrow. lt feels like this is normal. l thought l'd kill Mayumi when l found her. l was going to kill her when l found her. l thought l'd feel relieved if l battered her. Surprisingly, it's easy. How can you say that? l didn't want to at first. Not at all. lt was easy. lt really was. Because we die... so easily. Shall we run away somewhere? l thought l'd be killed like Mayumi if l fell asleep. l couldn't sleep, thinking about it. l'll have a bath to help me stay awake. l'm going to tell them. l'm going to tell them you raped me. lf the police come, l'm going to tell them. l stopped breathing, thinking l'd die. l didn't die. l can't stand it any more.
