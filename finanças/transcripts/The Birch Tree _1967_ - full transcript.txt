THE BIRCH Ouch, ouch. When I paint it, it'll be more beautiful than the ones in the sky. God, forgive me. The Evil One told me this sinful thought. God, forgive me. Rumenka! Rumenka! Damn you, where are you going? You will be struck down by the arrow of God! Joža! Dear Joža, you're a good guy. What would I do without you? Joža, what happened to Janica? Neighbour! What, for God's sake? -On which bed can I put her? Is she alive? Who knows? -She's alive, but she has high fever. Oh, I left my cattle. And my umbrella. Lead me not into temptation. Sinful thought, go away. Lead me not into temptation. What happened to Janica? -I don't know... She's too thin. -She can't have one baby and I gave birth to 6 of them. Valent, give us four brandies. -It's almost a funeral wake. Yes, something like that. God forbid giving funeral wakes for babies. Where would that lead us? It's strong. Hello. -Hi. -Marko, I'm looking for you. Why me? -Brandy for everyone. For me, too, please! Why would I buy you a brandy, be glad that you have bread to eat. It's a Christian's duty to feed the hungry and give drink to the thirsty. Give him a brandy, too. I'm in a good mood today. Thank you very much, dear God will pay you. Marko, my son is getting married. I need a flag bearer. And I buried my baby today. -I heard. It was 10 days old. lt's not even worth mentioning. -When a baby dies, that's sad. But at least you can have more. Later, you have another one, then one more and you forget about the first one. -You're right! Where will the wedding take place? -Somewhere in St. Kata. Marko, I need you to be the flag bearer. Marko is the best for the job, there's no one like him. No one can joddle like him. I don't know if I can get off work. -You will. -That's at least 3 days. It's a lot. -I will invite your boss, too. It's gonna be a great wedding. I don't think he'll come. The head forester is a refined man, but haughty as well. -All of you from that branch are haughty. The oak is haughty, the buck as well. -But a saw will topple one, and the rifle... bang... the other one. I'm counting on you, and you to take care of it with your boss. If bribe is necessary, I'm here. Valent, I'll pay for it. Wide Danube, plain Srem... Goodbye, my darling, I'm leaving... I was in the army in Novi Sad and I saw the Danube. That's a river. Our Kupa is nothing! A trench! And the Danube is like a sea. Wide Dunav, plain Srem... Marko! -What? Oh, Marko, you're singing out loud and your wife is sick. Janica is sick? How would I know that? -Jaga, come here. What can I do? -Oh, Marko, she's not feeling well. -I'm coming. We've made ourselves a deal, right? -I respect my promises. I'm drunk as St. Mark. I'll drink till I can think. Guys, I have to go home to bed. Bye. -Bye. Mom, she took my apple. -Let her, she's small. Give me my apple. Give it to me. Go to hell. Be quiet, Aunt Janica is very sick. Quiet. -Here you go, you'd eat anything. Now, both of you be quiet or I'll slap you. The hell will this turkey chirp here. -Marko will be mad. He made the turkey this, as he calls it, prosthesis. If it gets wet or loose, he'll be mad. -He has other worries. Marko... Call Marko for me. -He's not here, he went to the woods. What do you need him for? -Nothing. Jaga. -What? -When was my child buried? On Monday. Today is Friday. You count. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... I ploughed the whole field and I'll sow wheat tomorrow. I think the weather's gonna be good. -Is Janica feeling better? Don't ask, she still has a fever. I hope she won't end as Cvetniae's daughter-in-law. She became very sick after giving birth and died soon after. -It's all in God's hands. Maybe we should call the doctor. -Are you out of your mind? Tomo. Call the doctor. Do you know how much that would cost? Maybe it would be cheaper since Marko is a forester. He could send him a rabbit or a pheasant. Gentlemen like that. As soon as the doctor comes, he starts grumbling. That we are untidy and that sort of thing. And, furthermore, doctors never know anything. I called the old Ježoviae woman. She is good with spells and if she can't help her, not even God can. -Do what you want. These are women's things. Janica, my dear, look at yourself. You're so skinny, poor you. You're right. If you saw how skinny you are, you would scare yourself. -Truth be told, Janica was never too strong. She was skinny and weak. Praised be Jesus Christ. How is she? Is she feeling any better? What do you think? She is getting worse and worse. I don't think she'll get better. Joža, you're a good guy. It was a surprise when Marko left Bara Domitroviae for Janica. That kind of girl. Bara is strong and fat. Like a butcher. And she's rich as well. -What can I tell you, ladies. It's difficult to understand a man. -God knows if she'll survive. I'm afraid she won't. Maybe she's already talking to angels. Hello. -Hi. I'm the son of Vid Žugeeiae. You're the one getting married? -Yes. I came to ask you if you got days off from your boss? -I haven't asked him yet. Will you be the flag bearer? The wedding is next Sunday. I can't answer that, my wife is very sick. So? She doesn't have to come. -If she dies the same day, it's not appropriate for me to come. -He'll be busy at home. Funeral, the wake, you know. -What will happen then? Father wants you to be the bearer. Me too. -I really don't know. If my wife dies on that day, or if the funeral is on that day, then I won't come. I'll have to organize the wake. It's really inappropriate. -In that case, you'll have to find another flag bearer. If it's going to be possible, I'll come. And I'll let your father know. Goodbye then. Say hello to your dad. I'm really in an embarassing situation. To be honest, I would like to go to the wedding. -Maybe your wife will get better. A woman is like a cat... -Maybe she will, and maybe she'll die on the wedding day. The old Ježoviae woman is coming! -Really? I told you, the old woman is coming. -I hope it works. She caught it somewhere. Most importantly, her blood caught cold. It's serious and it would be good to use a cupping-glass. I said the same thing. -I'll try to get rid of spells. We've prepared everything. A spell has two eyes, one made of water, the other of fire. The eye of water beats the fire. Two spells, three against it, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. There's a gold hen and silver chicks. The hen bit into the spells and the chicks ate it. From four to three, from three to two, from two to one, from one to none, Janica has no spells now. There's no cross on the left hand, there's no place for enchantment. Spells, leave now, go up or down. From thorn to thorn, from corner to corner, from cross to cross. I'm getting rid of troubles and sadness. There's no bridge at the sea and no spell on Janica's body. The sun sets, the spell comes out. Janica sleeps and no spell survives. If a spell is there, she'll see it in her dream. -She's gonna faint. Take the leeches off. Bring me some warm water. Tomo, where are you going? -To Bikovski Vrh to get a passport. I want to take Rumenka to the fair. -Bring some paraffin and candles. We'll need it for the wake. Neighbour, is she dead? -Not yet, but she is past recovery. I don't think she'll survive the day. We'll have high expenses. I still owe for the baby, and now I'll have to pay the priest, the bell-ringer and a coffin for her. And the wake. Very expensive. Weddings cost a lot, too. But one is glad to spend the money when it's for a celebration. -We're not so lucky. Ask for the coffin too. Maybe someone could bring it so you don't have to go alone. Did you call the priest? -Joža went to get him. He could be here any second. -So, Marko will become a widower early. It's destiny. -God knows whether she'll be alive when I come back. If I see someone from the Žugeeiae family, what am I to tell them? Are you coming to the wedding? -I don't know. Illness came at the wrong moment. I should've called the doctor. He would've known what to do. I'm really angry. Where is the band playing? There is no music. I thought I heard them play at my wedding. Maybe the angels are playing music in the sky. Janica, Janica, you're more in the other than in this world. Praised be Jesus. -Dear friend, I think the end is near. The poor girl is already talking to the angels. And she is hearing a band play. -This is not a good sign. Janica, it's me, your mother. Do you recognize me? How are you, dear? Are you feeling sick? -I don't know, mom. Where is my Marko? Call him, I want to see him. For the last time. His beautiful eyes. His beautiful moustache. Marko, Janica is calling you. -I'll be there in a minute. -Hurry up, she says it's for the last time. -Let me finish this. Jaga! -What? -The priest is coming. It's the last moment. -You should've called him before. One always hopes for the best. I'm gonna tell mom. Marko, have you seen that white dove? No. There is no white dove in our village. I saw it. It was as white as the snow. It flew into the clouds. Marko, son, your wife died this minute. Now I know, that was Janica's soul, the white dove. It flew into the sky... My dear, young, Janica, you haven't lived, my dear daughter, and you already had to die. My dear Janica... Janica, I told you, if something goes wrong, it'll be your fault. My dear daughter, I lost you so young. Close her eyes. Her last words were, Marko, Marko, your beautiful eyes, and you didn't want to come when she called you. Oh my, the priest came. He's gonna lecture us. Praised be Jesus. -Now and forever. How is the patient? In the Name of the Father and of the Son.... -She just died. What? Died? And you call yourself Christians, shame on you. Dear Reverend, I saw a white dove fly off the Labudan's roof at the very moment Janica died. I think that was her soul, pure as the white dove. Joža, you always have strange fantasies. Damn weather. -Our job is damned. You couldn't force a dog to go out in this rain, and we're here in the rain, dark and mud. -That's our job. We're protecting our king and country. I feel weak. The salami that thief gave us yesterday... We should have a drink. There's brandy everywhere now. Wait, I want to light a cigarette. -In this rain? -Hold my hat. Take yours. Why should my head get wet? -Crybaby. Hold it! Here. Damn path. I stepped into a knee-deep puddle. One could break a leg here. My shoe is filled with water. The village is close. -But everyone's asleep. We'll wake up someone. -They'll be scared as hell. Why are people afraid of the police? The guilty and the innocent. It's fine till they're afraid. It's wrong when they are not. Do you hear that? A song! It's a wedding. If you don't drink it all, may in love you never fall. I was fair. Strict but fair. She is lying here, dead, and in front of her, and you, alive, I can say this. -I can confirm it. And now her mother says I'm responsible for her death. I admit it, Janica, I got drunk out of sorrow for you. That's a huge sin, and I can't tell you how sorry I am... I have to die, I can't eat... My dearest roasted turkey meat. Quiet... While the dead person is in the house... We shouldn't sing secular songs while the dead person is here. Which song do you want? I don't know. -Then why are you complaining? A mother stood under the crucifixion, under her son's crucified body... She cried and cried... Joža, what are you singing? It's a Lenten song. It's not Lent. That's a sad and religious song. It's more appropriate. Is St. Michael really a saint? -Of course. He's an Archangel, closest to God. Saint Michael's day arrived, the grapes are ready and ripe. My dear friend, drink some wine, enjoy what's left of your lifetime. -Good evening. Wait, gentlemen! Gentlemen, come in. Well... Gentlemen! The gentlemen got scared. They're afraid of the dead. The police, and they are afraid of the dead! Janica scared him, for God's sake. Have you seen the first one's face? It was pale! He stood there open-mouthed. -Like a fish. They quickly ran away! Stop it! Shame on you! Stop it! Quit it! What? Why are you breaking things? -Are you stupid? It didn't break. -Stop it, do you hear me? Oh, Janica, they're saying that you are scary. They want to make a scarecrow out of you and your beauty. Shame on all of you. Shame. I'm also ashamed. I'm a worthless person. You're not scary, no you're not. Dear daughter, the time came and we have to part. Oh, my dear Janica, when did you leave your dear dove. My dear daughter... My dear Janica, dearest Janica, it would be better if I were in your place. My daughter doesn't need me anymore, I experienced the good and bad... Why did you have to die young... God said so. Who is that girl? -Janica. Her father is Janko Godiniae. We had problems with him because of that oak tree. -I remember. His daughter is beautiful. Tall, skinny, as a birch-tree. People in the city would notice her as well. -You're right. What do you know? -If I may say so, boss, if the girl has nothing in front or the back, it's like a village with no church and school. Master Valent, a litre of wine! -Kata, a litre of wine on this table. Bara is so proud that she's dancing with the forester. She thinks he's gonna marry her. -Yeah, right. He's not to be trusted. He broke up with a lot of girls. Girls, don't look at that. That's pure sin. Why? Nobody is fighting yet. People are having fun. If I were the Pope, I'd forbid that. Is this the way to celebrate dear God, by swearing and sinning... I'd forbid that! -You want to be bigger priest than the reverend. Janica, let's go home together. -I'm not coming. I like it here. I bought you this. Have you seen the Saint? -He bought a heart for a girl. -Oh, Joža. This doesn't mean anything. I just want to thank her for looking after my cattle. -Excuses, excuses. Look at that girl. What do you think? -She's good looking. I think that she's a real beauty. Why are those gentlemen looking at you? -Who knows? I guess they like me. -Labudan! Labudan! Marko! Come here! Yes? -This gentleman and I will come to Matetinka tomorrow. Wait for us there. -Do you need a carrier? -No, we'll take the dogs. Who is that girl? -Which one? -That one there. That's Janica Godiniae. We had a problem with her father because of that oak. Such a beauty all alone and all of you are dancing with bears. Don't say that, Branko. That girl... She's like a birch-tree in the woods, like a birch among beeches. I get it. My boss likes you a lot. -So? I'm not interested in gentlemen. A gentleman comes and goes. Is this a clock? -Yes it is. Are these two cops? -Yes they are. Is this a turkey? -Yes it is. A turkey, two cops. -Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a young priest? -Yes it is. Is he riding a horse? -Yes he is. A young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops, everybody's life one day stops. Is this a black dog? -Yes it is. Is this a beautiful girl? -Yes it is. A black dog, a beautiful girl, a young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops, everybody's life one day stops. Are this women's panties? -Yes they are. Are this high expenses? -Yes they are. A women's panties, high expenses, a black dog, a beautiful girl, a young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops, everybody's life one day stops! Janica, Janica, you left me on my own, me, an old poor woman, oh, Janica, Janica! Janica, it's time to go home. Janica! -Bye girls, I had fun. -Bye. Klasniae's Kata told me you danced with Labudan. He asked for a dance so I danced, what could I do? Not just once, but three times. And you danced a waltz. I couldn't refuse. -The forester is no match for you. He is 10, 15 years older. -He doesn't have to marry me because he danced with me. -You'll get a bad reputation. He left a girl with a baby in Moslavina. And Brajkoviae's widow. Now he's dating Bara Domitroviae. He'll leave her too. What will father say? You could've remembered that he sued our father for that oak. It's not my fault, who would remember everything? Wait. Take your scarf off. -Why? -Just take it off. My boss was right, you're like a birch. I'm in a hurry, my mom will be angry. -Wait. I want to talk to you. -What do we have to talk about? You have your Bara. -We're not in a relationship. I just danced with her, that doesn't mean anything. I like you a lot. -Mama tells me to beware of you. Am I such a bum? -No, but I'm told that you're not to be trusted. You cheat and leave every girl. -You believe that? -Yes and no. If I ever cheated, I won't cheat on you. -Yeah, right. I like you a lot, you know. -You say that to all the girls. There is no girl like you in the whole district. I like you a lot. I'll make it, so that it resembles you. How can an angel resemble a woman? -Angels are sexless. I'm not fond of those who are neither male nor female. -Janica. You don't understand a thing. God gave you beauty, and beauty doesn't last forever. I want to a immortalize it in wood. People won't know it's you. The beauty will remain forever. Janica, don't get married. -What? And remain a spinster? Let's go to the convent. I'll be a monk, and you a nun. Joža, Joža. I would marry Marko Labudan tomorrow, if he wanted me. Go, go... Mom, the forester. -What does he want? -Hello. -Hi. Is your husband at home? -Yes, he's sleeping under the hayrick. Hello. -Hi. Janko, you caused a problem in the woods? -Don't be angry. There are other things we can talk about. -Why did you come? I want to talk about something important. Mom, you can come too. -C'mon. Janica, come here! Janica, you've been given in marriage. We didn't ask you. It wasn't necessary. She already said what she thought. Janica, Janica, if something goes wrong, it'll be your fault. Do you hear that? You don't have a good reputation. Be careful. If you don't respect your word, you won't end well. This is not a joke. -Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine. He left Bara Domitroviae, how strange. -It was a good decision. It's good that Janko's son-in-law is forester. Love your wife in the same way you love your body and yourself. Love your wife as Christ loved the church. I join you in matrimony. In the name of the Father... Saint Joža, come here! -I'm not a saint! I'm a sinner and a miserable person. -Come, you'll see Janica! I won't! I'm getting away from this sin and blasphemy. You miss Janica? -Why didn't you marry her? Her father would've been happier. -And now you're sorry! Oh, God... You organized the whole world wisely and gracefully. The Sun, Moon and Stars, as well. You've defined their paths. And you gave our earth a variety of plants, and you created man in your own image. If you created him in your own image, why did you tell us to go forth and multiply? Multiply... How? In the same shameful way as the animals! Why? Why not as the plants? Pollen is carried by the wind or bugs and the flower is fertilized. Pure and without sin. Lead me not into temptation. Lead me not into temptation. My dear Janica, I'm so sorry. You were good and diligent, I have to admit, and your mother-of-law didn't want to. You know, my Dora is strict and harsh. My dear Janica, Janica, my dear daughter. My darling, my dear daughter, why did you have to die, you haven't lived properly, and you already died. My darling, my first and only one. Joža! I'm so unhappy. My dear daughter died. It's all God's will. Maybe it was for the best, for you and the baby. How can you say that? Your daughter is now an angel in the sky. She's now singing with other angels in front of God and praying for us. Joža, you know a lot about religion, but this is nonsense. The baby was just born, of course it doesn't know how to pray. How can it sing when it didn't even know how to cry? -You don't get it. These are holy things. -May God help me, I don't. My cattle's going to escape. -Yes... Pi, pi pi... Jano! Jano! Don't you hear me? Are you deaf? Why are you yelling, don't you see I'm ill? You have to put the cow to pasture. -I can barely stand. I can't go. I have a temperature. If I were healthy, I'd walk my baby to the cold grave. That's because you didn't sleep. The cow must be put to pasture. I'll give her hay and she can stay inside. -What are you talking about? And what will we feed her during the winter? -Then I'll go. I want to die. -You're not that sick that you couldn't go. What are you pretending to be, a high-class lady? ... and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Go in peace. It was destiny. So young and she already died. Can't we all be happy? No, we can't. Dear God knows why. May God's will be done. Let God's mercy, which gave us the sun, shine upon those sitting in darkness and death shadow, and to guide us to peace. This is the place I chose for this deceased woman. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and will be forever. May she rest in peace, Lord. You are a dust and you will return to dust. Would you look after my oxen so I can go to the graveyard? If you won't be long. -I won't. I just want to throw some soil on the grave. Oh, grandpa! Thank God I'm alive. -You didn't have to get that drunk. Well, this is over now. We could go to Fintiae for a brandy. Yes. It's good for comforting your heart and soul. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women... It's not nice to be in the grave. Janica, my dear daughter-in-law, I feel so sorry for you. You died so young and I'm old and still alive. Valent, a brandy for everyone. Young Žugeeiae sends it. Marko, will you go to Žugeeiae's wedding? Maybe. -Of course he will. Why wouldn't he go? It would be better not to go. -But you promised, you have to go. It all turned out absurdly... So, Marko? -It's you, Žugeeiae. So, will you come? The wedding is on st. Kate's. It's a bit inappropriate. I buried my wife today. Don't do this to us. We don't have a flag bearer. Of course he'll be there. You'll be in mourning later. Why wouldn't you go when people care about it so much? Yes, why not? -Fine. I'll be there. Mr. head forester, I'd like to take three days off. Why? Where are you going? -To a wedding. Wedding? -Yes. -You buried your wife yesterday. And what a wife. A real beauty. -That's true, but they don't have a flag bearer and they want me. So, you're gonna be a flag bearer? -Yes. Nice. After all, that's your concern. I give you three days off. Thank you very much, boss. God sees, hears and knows everything! Watch it, you damn saint! Let him go, Marko. Idiot. Welcome! Mata, Mata! Are you deaf? Bring me a glass of wine. Mata! He wants to drink for free. -I got thirsty from standing here. Go home. Who invited you? -Mata, give me a glass of wine. Have you seen the forester dancing? He buried his wife yesterday. -That's why women flock to him. I don't know why Žugeeiae wanted him as the flag bearer. As if there's no one on our hill for that job. -Listen. You're a widower now. -I'll marry you. -You could. I'm a widow. Lighting killed your husband, it could kill me, too. Cheers! -It's best to make love to someone else's wife. -I agree. Shame on you. -They're so immoral. Don't squeeze me so much. My husband is watching. So let him watch. You're a Mlinariae now, right? I remember you when you were a girl. -I remember you and your moustache. The most beautiful moustache in the world. -You're attractive. You're worth sinning for. -Don't talk like that. I would like to tell you much more. -You're joking. -It's the truth. When the music stops, come to the back yard. I'll wait for you. -If someone sees me, Franc will kill me. Don't you worry. I'll find someone to entertain him. You're the son of Miško Mlinariae? -Yes, and? And? -I'm just asking. You're hanging too close to our wives. You're stupid as hell. Is this a clock? -Yes it is. Is this a turkey? -Yes it is. A turkey, two cops. -Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a young priest? -Yes it is. Is he riding a horse? -Yes he is. A young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops. Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a black dog? -Yes it is. Is this a beautiful girl? -Yes it is. A black dog, a beautiful girl, a young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops. -Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a clock? -Yes it is. Are these two cops? -Yes they are. Is this a turkey? -Yes it is. A turkey, two cops. -Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a young prest? -Yes it is. Is he riding a horse? -Yes he is. A young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops. Everybody's life one day stops. Is this a black dog? -Yes it is. Is this a beautiful girl? -Yes it is. A black dog, a beautiful girl, a young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops. -Everybody's life one days stops. Are these women's panties? -Yes they are. Are these high expenses? -Yes they are. A women's panties, high expenses, a black dog, a beautiful girl, a young priest riding a horse, a turkey, two cops. Everybody's life one day stops! Where are you going? -What? -What about the forester? Which forester? You think, because you're a forester... -Don't even try! You think you scare me? Guys, calm down. Go Franc, go! It's a disgrace! I'll come back with a gun! He escaped! You think we're afraid of you? -We got you! Come here if you dare! I'll show you... Where's my hat? It's gone. Damn you, wait for me, I'll come back with a gun. I'll shoot you all, like rabbits! I'll show you tonight! I'll show you who Marko Labudan is! I'll shoot you all! Like rabbits! I'll show you. Marko Labudan. I'll show you. How dare you touch me, Marko Labudan? I'll shoot you like a dog. I'll go to Lepoglava if I must! You touched... Janica, Janica!
