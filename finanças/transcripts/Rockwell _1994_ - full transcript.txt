(dramatic ominous music) (bright ambient tone music) (expectant ambient tone) (logo whooshing) (soft uneasy music) (ax pounding) (Willie grunting) (Amy humming) - Amy, go get Willie. We're ready for breakfast. - Yes, Mama. (horses whinnying) (soft uneasy music) (ax thudding) - [Amy] Willie, Ma sent me to fetch you home. - Get back to the cabin now. Tell Ma I'll be home soon. - She said now, Willie. - Go on now. - All right. (ax thudding) (soft uneasy music) (ax thudding) (horse whinnying) (soft uneasy music) - [Ma] Matthew? (gunshot blasting) - No! - [Amy] Willie, Willie! (gunfire blasting) - Papa! - Amy! (gunfire blasting) (tense dramatic music) (gunfire blasting) (horse hooves clopping) (tense dramatic music) - [Willie] How someone could do this, I'd never understand. It just didn't make sense. But I was to find this was just the beginning of a way of life for our people. We thought America was a place for freedom. There were some after our property, and others bent on religious persecution. With my family gone, the only person I could turn to was our leader and my friend, Joseph Smith. He'd led our people away from violence and all he'd ever wanted was peace for us, but it just wasn't to be. And that's when I first met Porter Rockwell. (soft thoughtful music) People said old Porter was an unlit powder keg, but he'd just as soon walked away from a fight. Some folks said Joseph told him he couldn't be killed because of his hair. I don't know if he really believed that himself. - We have to get rid of this so-called prophet once and for all. Once he's gone, as people will scatter like sheep. They're just simple farmers, it won't be difficult. - Governor got your message yet? - Oh yes, yes the warrant has been issued for Smith's arrest. Then once he's safely jailed, you can do the rest. (soft uneasy music) - [Willie] Chauncey Higbee had once been a close friend to Joseph Smith, but now he had a personal vendetta against him, and sought our entire destruction. (soft uneasy music) - Sh, hold your horse. - Porter, never seen that one before. - Come on, (clicking) come on, hyah. (soft uneasy music) Joseph. - [Willie] Now Joseph had been Porter Rockwell's best friend since they were kids, and he'd always warned Porter to turn the other cheek. Maybe because of that, folks thought Porter never had any emotion, 'cause he didn't often show much on his face. (soft uneasy music) - Mr. Smith, Joseph Smith? I have official orders from the governor. (soft sorrowful music) - Oh, Papa. (Porter spitting) - Hyah, hyah. - Hyah, hyah. (soft uneasy music) - Why'd they take him all the way to Carthage? There's a circuit judge right here. It doesn't make any sense. They'll have to let him go. He's been arrested many times before, they've always let him go. - Yeah. - [Willie] You may need this, Joseph. (soft somber music) - We'll have ourselves a pretty piece of real estate once he's taken care of. - Who says they'll leave Nauvoo? - The law of gravity. (mob shouting) What rises, falls. (soft uneasy music) - Get a rope! (mob shouting) - Smith! (mob shouting) (gunfire blasting) (mob shouting) - Get in there! - Come here! - Get in there! - Yeah, come on! (soft sorrowful music) - [Willie] None of us thought Joseph would die that day. I guess we just never believed this could happen. But he did say he'd never come back if he was taken to Carthage, and our enemies were now sure this would put an end to us. I think it hit one person as hard as it did anybody, and I saw something change in Porter that day. Nothing was ever gonna be the same. (gunfire blasting) (glass shattering) (gunfire blasting) - Fire! (gunfire blasting) - (sighing) Hell's bells. Look, I know you men ain't much for fighting. Hinkley, put your firing pin in. Ready. (gunfire blasting) - Elijah Abel? So that's how you got to be an undertaker. Makes sense, create your own business. (whimsical Western music) - Where'd you learn to shoot like that? - Wasn't easy growing up close to a slave state. Ma said I can get nabbed at any time, taken back across the border. Pa helped me make this a hobby. - Good hobby. (soft harmonica music) - Let's see if all this training paid off. All right, let's see what you men can do. Ready? Fire. (gunfire blasting) (bright hopeful music) - Whoa. - It's Brigham. - If you've got all this free time, help the sick and the poor with the crops. I want you staying out of trouble. (soft thoughtful Western music) (lively Western saloon music) - Brigham Young's keeping these people together like mortar. - Thought you said they'd scatter with Smith dead. - Mortar can be cracked. - It's an awful lot of property for them to leave. - And they will. (lively Western saloon music continues) - Hello Higbee. (spitting) Sorry, I missed. (tense dramatic music) (punch thudding) - All we need is the guise of an inciting incident, and gentlemen, I think we'll have it soon. (lively Western saloon music) (soft uneasy music) - [Thug] Rockwell? Worrell wants to talk to you. (tense dramatic music) (gunfire blasting) (dogs howling) (tense dramatic music) (water splashing) (tense dramatic music continues) (horses whinnying) (dogs barking) - Hey, better get those damn dogs outta here. (laughing) Come on out Rockwell. (dogs barking) Get up here. (horse whinnying) Last time Rockwell. (gunfire blasting) Ken, get him out of there. (dramatic adventurous music) (soft uneasy music) What are you looking at? Now men, go find him. You too. (dramatic adventurous music) (water splashing) (fist pounding) (Porter panting) - Could sure use a little help. - [Mary Ann] Come in. - Whose place is this? - Neff's place. - Your folks around? - Ma's feeling poor, Pa took her to town. - Left you alone? - Animals need feeding. - I reckon so. - Let me get you something. Here, these are Pa's. Aren't you Porter Rockwell? - [Willie] Porter New from Worrell's vengeance that little time was left, and Joseph's promise that we'd go West one day was soon to be. But little did Porter know that this kindness of young Mary Ann Neff would entwine their lives one day. - You ever settling down and getting married? (soft gentle music) - [Willie] Saw the way she looked at you. - Same way my horse looks at me. - Cute little girl, she'll be beautiful. - Yeah, then she'll be trouble. - No wonder you're not married. (soft uneasy music) - I take it you are Brigham Young? - May I ask the purpose of your presence? - To crush your uprising. - What uprising? - By order, sir- - General Harden, why don't you capture the murderers of Joseph Smith? - I don't know if I'll be able to hold back the mobs much longer. (soft uneasy music) (tense dramatic music) - Hyah! (soft poignant music) - [Willie] The violence against our people began to escalate. Whether the persecution was political or religious, it didn't really matter now. Higbee's men wanted the Mormons out, and even Porter couldn't stop a prairie fire. (soft uneasy music) (horse whinnying) - Move on, get in the woods. - Hyah. (horse whinnying) (gunfire blasting) (townspeople screaming) (gunfire blasting) - Porter, help my daughter. (posse shouting) (gunfire blasting) (tense dramatic music) (club thudding) (horse whinnying) (soft tense music) (punch thudding) (footsteps crunching) (tense uneasy music) - (laughing) Rockwell! (gunshot blasting) Don't any of you move on him, he's mine. (gunfire blasting) (Frank shouting) (gunshot blasting) (tense dramatic music) (birds chirping) - What's the matter Rockwell, you don't like them tagging on other charges, like the murder of Frank Worrell? He was Mr. Higbee's friend. 'Cause of that, you're never gonna see your friends again. Some say your friends are starving over in Iowa, and they left us a pretty little piece of real estate. Frank Worrell was my friend too. So eat hearty boy, your trial's in four more months. (soft tense music) - [Willie] The weeks passed slowly, especially with little or no food, as Porter waited for his bogus trial for the murder of Frank Worrell. The jailer's daughter brought him water every week, as much as her Pa would allow. - Not everybody liked Worrell. Not everybody likes Higbee. Ma says you oughta know that. - What do you think? - I've seen you looking at me. - What? - You married? - Not no more. - You going West alone? (keys clanking) - Honey, I don't think we wanna do that. (soft uneasy music) - [Willie] Finally after months, Porter's trial was held at Galena, Illinois and he was acquitted by the jury for the murder of Frank Worrell. - The defendant is not guilty. (gavel banging) (observers shouting) - [Willie] This was just another humiliation for Chauncey Higbee, and he wasn't about to let it rest. Meanwhile, our people had been driven West, and Porter decided he had to join us. - I can cook pretty good. - Well, I reckon I know how to cook already. - I can shoe a horse. - So can I, thank you kindly. - I can load a gun and shoot it. - Now it's getting interesting, but I reckon I can do all those things. - Porter, they'll be after you. (tense uneasy music) - He hasn't even seen the beginning. (bright adventurous music) Gentlemen, Brigham and his people have been settled in the valley for six years now. The mining prospects they've developed are staggering, and it's only the beginning. But you'll need to establish a federal judge who is sympathetic to your interests. And of course you'll have to go head to head with Brigham Young. Well, I know just the man for the job. Gentlemen, William W Drummond. - [Willie] The Eastern Mining Company, where Higbee was now chairman of the board, had more power to exploit us than we ever imagined. And with the arrival of Higbee's federal judge, they set out to extort the mining claims from our people. - Quaint, very quaint, driver. (horse whinnying) - Hear you're wanting a partner to sell lumber from the canyon. - Yeah, tell you what, in a couple of days my wife and little girl are coming in on the stage. Little girl's been back East ever since we came out. I'll need help loading up their things. You meet me at the station and then we'll talk. - I ain't got time to pick up wives and little girls. - You want a deal? (bright lively music) - John, John. (soft gentle music) - Mary Ann. - Papa. - Welcome home. (Mary Ann laughing) (soft gentle music) - [Mary Ann] Beautiful place. - [Porter] You've grown up. - [Mary Ann] Yes, I'm now a poised and educated, (laughing) sorry, young woman. - [Porter] Your Pa's says you've been to school. - [Mary Ann] Yes, oh yes. Can I read you a story sometime? - [Porter] Guess I ain't much of a reader. - Listen, there's more. "Then Poseidon, shaker of the earth answered him. 'Straightaway I would do even as thou sayest, O God of the dark clouds.'" Have you been listening? - Yeah, good story. - Who am I reading about? - Can't remember his name. Samson or somebody? - Ulysses, it's his odyssey. (soft gentle music) (Mary Ann shouting) (water splashing) (Mary Ann screaming) (water splashing) (Mary Ann laughing) (soft gentle music) - Mary Ann? - Oh, hello. (soft gentle music) - It's all braided and it's beautiful. (bright whimsical music) (lively upbeat string music) (partygoers cheering) (soft gentle string music) - Girl over here keeps looking at me. I reckon she's got pretty good taste. Oh, she'll be over in just a minute or so, and ask me to dance. - Hm, are you sure about that? - She's got that look, you can tell. If I don't make any move to ask her to dance, she will. Now why don't you go dance? - Ah, too busy to even think about women. - Yeah, I'm never too busy. - I got a farm I need to finish up. - You like it better? - Hm, it's better than undertaking. Sick of death, besides, you couldn't pay me enough money to go back. - She sure is pretty, and here she comes. You have a good time tonight. - I will. (bright gentle string music) - You wanna dance? (bright gentle string music) That night's when I first realized Porter cared for Mary Ann Neff, but he wouldn't talk much about it. We could see problems in the wind. She'd expect him to settle down, and eventually get married. (bright gentle string music) - Comes from a fine orchard. - [Willie] Even though Porter didn't usually show his feelings much, I know he had strong and tender feelings about life, and I know he did want to settle down and lead a peaceful life, with all his heart. - Unusual weather out here. - Time it rained, quench some thirst. - Some out here thirst for more than rain. They thirst for blood. - I've settled down. - I figured as much, let me show you something. Hinkley was a friend of yours, wasn't he? (soft uneasy music) - Where's his ears? - We couldn't find them. - [Willie] Hinkley had been a good neighbor of Porter's back in Illinois. He was only 23 and never had a family, but all he'd ever wanted was the same thing Mary Ann now wanted, to get married and settle a farm. (soft poignant music) - I thought that you and the land and I were. Some women have dreams that are just dreams, don't they? - [Porter] It won't last forever. (thunder rumbling) (soft expectant music) - Mr. Rockwell? My name's Frank Slade. Come clear across the country to meet you. A man with mining interests sent me. I understand you can't be killed because of your hair. Well, I think the man who told you that was a liar. I intend to prove him one. (Porter laughing) What's that supposed to mean? - You can't shoot that thing without a firing pin. (gunshot blasting) (birds cawing) - Hmm, yeah, it's going to be good. ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ (birds tweeting) You always do that? - When I'm thirsty, you want some? - No, thank you. - How long's that fish been dead? (flies buzzing) - Found it on the trail yesterday. - You ain't seen a Marshal Rockwell abouts, have you? - Never heard of him. You on the run yourself? - Have been, once shot a militia captain. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Yep. - Yeah? - Yeah. - (laughing) I'm gonna show you something. Ah, there it is. (laughing) - Glorious, what are they? - Ears, I collect ears. (laughing) - This one here, this is a barkeep in Tucson. This one is an Indian brave. (laughing) - That one there on the end looks fresh. - I just got that one. (laughing) Belonged to a feller staking a claim. Now, the feller that hired me said that I could do anything I want with him. Yeah, kid's name was Hinkley. - Fine collection. - Thank you. - But it ain't big enough. - (laughing) I know, I know. - Cut off yours and put them in, make your collection bigger. - (laughing) I like you boy. You're funny. (laughing) - So do it. - I only cut off ears of dead people. - That's right. - But I ain't dead. (gunfire blasting) (soft somber music) (birds cawing) (bucket clanking) - Hell, I reckon they need words said over them. Aw, to hell with them. (bodies thudding) - [Willie] While Rockwell was putting out one fire, Higbee's men were starting another. They were setting about the work of jumping claims for Higbee's mining company. - Where's your brother? - [Thug] He's still in town, waiting to hear from Judge Drummond. - Ah, hell. (soft uneasy music) You just better hope your Pa gives up that claim, little girly. (laughing) - Taught him every good thing there is. (thugs laughing) (foot thudding) (Buster groaning) - Ah hell, ah hell, hell. (thugs laughing) (Buster groaning) (gunshot blasting) - Hey Buster, Buster! (dramatic tense music) (gunfire blasting) (insects chirping) - You been up all night? - I'll get you home before sundown. - You in the play next week? Papa says you were in the play back in Nauvoo, said you played the devil. - Mm. - Did you like playing the devil? Can I braid your hair? - If you want, but don't tie it to anything. - How come it's so long? - Just is. - Sounds like you're kinda like Samson. - All I need is a Delilah, and I'd be all right. (insects chirping) - Aren't I pretty? - Mm. - I ain't too young. - I swear I'm the only man alive this happens to. (bright adventurous music) (soft gentle music) - Pa! - Heather. (soft gentle music) (horse whinnying) - This was on your door. - Read it. - "Stay out of the way of business if you and Mr. Young intend to stay." Ain't signed. I hear men from the mining company are headed this way with their treasurer. He's got all the records of their company. We could prove with them who's behind all this. - Just one other man would do. (soft expectant music) - Morning, Julia. - Elijah's busy these days. - Well we all are, Julia. (rooster crowing) - You guys tracked me down. - Oh it was real tough Abel, real tough. - Give you some supper? - You know what I want. - What you want or what you need? - It's what I need. - Come in and have some fish. - We don't have time. - Then make time, could be your last meal. - You still ain't answered my question. (horse whinnying) - [Willie] I thought you said they couldn't pay you to do this again. - [Elijah] Ain't getting paid. - [Willie] I hear these are crack gunmen, none like whatever we've faced before. They test hundreds of men to find shooters like these. - Would you shut up? (soft uneasy music) (horse hooves clopping) (soft uneasy music) (posse shouting) (soft uneasy music continues) (horses whinnying) (door creaking) - The horses. - You men drop your guns. You're under arrest. (gunfire blasting) (soft tense music) - We might be the only folks you know that wanna keep you alive. - Who's behind this, who? Who. - Mr. Higbee. - Rockwell? Bury his ass. Torch his woman, his friends, everybody. And don't let him rest until he is under the earth. (soft uneasy music) - Mr. Harwood, treasurer of the Wasatch Mining Company, must remain in Great Salt Lake City until the trial's completion. - We request protective custody. - Denied. (gavel pounding) (soft uneasy music) - Nothing's happening here. Go on, get some sleep. - Oh I'm all right, you go ahead. I'll wait here. (soft uneasy music) (rocking chair creaking) (rattlesnake rattling) (tense dramatic music) (gunshot blasting) (knuckles knocking) - Willie, Willie. - With no evidence and no witnesses, the Wasatch Mining Company is hereby absolved of all claim jumping charges. The complaint is dismissed with prejudice. (gavel pounding) - (laughing) Gerald, the director was over, remind you of a play you have next week. I'm sure you're really thrilled over that. - I'd keep myself covered from now on if I was you. - Yeah, they roped Abel into it. - They didn't rope me into nothing. - Oh, then how come you're playing a Peruvian Indian with a loin cloth? - I like Peruvian Indians. - You're hopeless Abel, standing in the theater like that with all those people around. - I like theater, and I can't help it if some of us have culture. - (laughing) Yeah, yeah you think culture with a loin cloth. (Mary Ann laughing) Isn't that Howard Nicholson? - You all right? (Mary Ann humming) (bird cooing) (tense uneasy music) (dog barking) (tense uneasy music continues) - [Mary Ann] (screaming) Who put this thing in here? - I'm gonna bury you sweetheart, but first we're gonna have some fun. (gunfire blasting) (Mary Ann screaming) (soft somber music) - All right, I can't seem to put the reins on this avenging angel. Prepare horses for me. (spitting) I am sick of these incompetents. (soft uneasy music) - I appreciate that you at least buried him. - He ain't worth the effort. - All the same, it's more civilized. - Yeah, we gotta be civilized. - Windy up here, isn't it? Howard Nicholson is leaving for California. - You thinking of going with him? - He's already gone, he's sending for me. Thought I might try it if the plot in my book doesn't change. Ulysses needed a miracle, do you believe in miracles? Howard says it's safer there. I guess you can't question him about that. Mainly, I suppose it's my heart that needs a little safety. (chuckling) - Mary Ann. (soft thoughtful music) - Two more bits. Need more help than that can give? (lively Western saloon music) - [Willie] Higbee was now halfway to the Utah Territory, and since the men of his mining company had failed him he'd take care of things his own way. - Got another dozen for you, sir. (snakes rattling) (soft uneasy music) - Wasn't aware a rattlesnake could be so tasty. - Considered a delicacy in many parts, if it's prepared properly. - How you gonna put the reins on this avenging angel anyway? - Well, no blades or bullets can harm him. I think I've definitely found his vulnerability. See, he almost died from a snake bite years ago, and that was only one snake bite. - You don't believe that nonsense about his hair protecting him? - I believe he can't escape stewardship. I wish he'd been under my stewardship. I should have led the church, but Joseph Smith wouldn't listen to me. Now, Brigham Young is my only obstacle. (chuckling) (soft thoughtful music) - If you really believe your hair will protect you, you have to believe the other part of Joseph's promise to you. - What's the point in gambling? - Even the best gamblers miss the odds. (soft somber music) Nothing is worth drinking yourself to hell over. - She is. - Higbee's coming with men. - Higbee? - Just remember who needs you. - Here, give her this. (soft somber music) (soft thoughtful music) - You know his weaknesses, and you know what he's seen, and you know what he stands for. But do you know, really know his heart? - I'm going to California. - If that's what you want. But before you go, he wanted me to give you this. (horse hooves clopping) (soft uneasy music) (bright piano music) (audience cheering) - [Play Narrator] Thank you, and welcome to the Social Hall, as we present to you a play of history and truth and knowledge. We begin with the unexpected arrival of the messenger dwarf. (actor shouting) (audience cheering) (tense uneasy music) (horses whinnying) - [Actor] Ah so, you think that was funny? I say nay, oh captain. I remind you of your own (drowned out by music). - I never felt so idiotic in my life. - [Elijah] You never looked so idiotic. - Yeah, you should talk. How do you get me into this? - You need character, Willie my boy, character. - Boys. - I'll fight your battles day, but not this again. I'd rather die for you. - [Actor] Oh mighty chief, spare us. - Don't worry Willie, that could be next. - True! - Oh, we tread- - [Actor] Hark the captain, he comes. - [Actor] I hear him come, let's take off. - Everyone, keep up with me. - Yes sir. - Man, easy. - Just get going. (audience applauding) (director clearing throat) (bright piano music) - [Director] I am the mighty captain. I am the mighty captain. (audience laughing) Come. - [Audience Member] He's too dense, get off the stage. (audience laughing) - [Director] Say your line, say your line! - Say your line brother, let's get this over with. (audience laughing) - Come, come. - Porter, do something. (director groaning) (audience laughing) - It's ruined. You dummkopf, you ruined my whole play. - Shall I stick him? (audience laughing) - [Director] Bring the curtain down, bring it down. (audience applauding) (audience laughing) (soft uneasy music) - [Elijah] I don't know what just happened. I just know I'm just never doing this again. - They're waiting for us. - Let's do it. Keep on the front, I'll come in from the back. - You know the plan, go. (horse hooves clopping) (soft uneasy music) - Come on. - That was something. - Can we get our money back? (gunfire blasting) (thug shouting) (gunfire blasting) (townspeople screaming) (gunfire blasting) (soft tense music) (Elijah whistling) (gunfire blasting) - Willie. - You all right? - I think he got away. - Go get him. - I'll take care of Willie. - You sure? - Go on. (gunfire blasting) (tense uneasy music) (gun clicking) - [Thug] Drop it. (laughing) (gunfire blasting) (thug shouting) (gunfire blasting) (dramatic tense music) (birds cawing) (soft tense music) - Welcome to your kingdom, Higbee. - You know, it was inevitable. Unarmed? (laughing) It's no way to win a war, Porter. (gunfire blasting) (soft expectant music) I just had to prove it for myself, didn't I? Now it's your turn to come get me. (tense uneasy music) (rattlesnakes rattling) - Point blank, you can't miss unless you're a coward. - You're a fool, Porter. It could've all been yours if you'd have just joined me. - Oh, damn you Higbee! - Get away! Help me. - Porter! Help Higbee. (Higbee shouting) (club thudding) (snake hissing) (Porter and assistant screaming) (tense dramatic music) (snakes hissing) (dramatic adventurous music) (soft thoughtful music) - What men are we? - Don't be late. - For what? - For the new play, rehearsal starts in 20 minutes. - (chuckling) Oh, why not? No one ever knew why Higbee and his assistant never showed up again. Porter wouldn't talk about it. He wouldn't talk about what he really believed about his hair, and he wouldn't talk about a lot of things, least of all, Mary Ann Neff. - Porter! - [Willie] But he and Mary Ann would finally get together. I guess you want me to say they lived happily ever after. But you wouldn't really believe that now, would you? (bright adventurous music) (dramatic adventurous music) (bright adventurous music) (soft thoughtful music) (bright adventurous music) (soft thoughtful music) (lively Western saloon music) (soft thoughtful music) (bright adventurous music)
