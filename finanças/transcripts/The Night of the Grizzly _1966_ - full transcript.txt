There's the bank. We won't be gone long, so don't wander off too far. Well sir, guess I'll take me a wee look around. Well, well. I bet my bottom dollar it's Big Jim Cole. You must be Mr. Benson. No sir, there ain't no doubt at all about you being a kid of Charlie's. Oh this is my wife. How do you do, Mr. Benson? It's a pleasure. Now you folks come right in. Come right in and sit down. Mrs. Cole. Thank you sir. Hard trip, Mrs. Cole? You ever ride 150 miles on a wagon seat, Mr. Benson? I know what you mean. That's sure a nice piece of property you folks inherited. Jim, did did that will your granddaddy's lawyer read to you mention anything about a loan against that land? Why no. How much of a loan? $500. Plus $175 interest. Howdy. Oh, howdy. You, you just passing through? No, gonna reside here permanent. Me and my compadre, Big Jim Cole are taking over the old Cole place. Well now, ain't that nice? My name's Sam Potts, what's yourn? I got a long one. Wilhelmina Christina Maximiliana Peterson. Wilhelmina, I'll call you Bill. Mind if I chew? No, spittoons back by the pool table. I got me a wee problem, Bill. Can't seem to locate a saloon in this here town. Wonder if you'd be kind enough to direct me. It's a dry county. Oh, Sam Potts this here's Tad and Cal Curry. Dry county? You got $10? Sure I got $10, why? Well, if you give it to us in about 15 minutes we just might be able to quench that awful thirst you've been moaning about. You got yourself a deal, go get her. First? Oh we can't get no credit. Well, hurry it up no more than 15 minutes now. Not a second more. You fellers want me to go with you? No, no, no, you just wait for us right here. All right, hurry up! Just these nice boys. Say that's a nice coat. You sick? No, I was just thinking. Care to sit and think a spell Rosebud? Name ain't Rosebud, it's Gypsy. Shake hands with a champion. If Jed Curry heard what I'm about to say to you, he'd shoot me dead. Your granddaddy won that land from him in a poker game, and Curry wants it back so bad he's fit to be tied. He wants it for his boys, Tad and Cal. You don't take it, he will. And for $675 he'll get the richest section of land in the whole territory. Well he ain't gonna get it, Mr Benson. Good. But Jim, $675? Well that'll take almost everything we got. We hadn't even seen that land. I don't have to see that land. There you are, paid in full. Congratulations. Thank you, Mr. Benson. Good luck, Jim. Thanks. I'll be out to see you in a couple days. Fine. Now if you'll just give us an idea how to get to this ranch of ours, we'll be on our way. Indeed I will. I'll take you outside and point you right. Oh boy, a fight! Charlie! Looks like our boy's getting acquainted. I'll be out to see you folks. Nice to have met you. Charlie! Come on, Charlie. Oh, Charlie. You should be ashamed of yourself. I'm not gonna let anybody belt me in the butt with no rock. Charlie? That's enough, boy. Come on, simmer down. Well, quite a young tiger you got there. You must be Jim Cole. Yeah, that's right. My name's Curry. Jed Curry. Howdy. This is Mrs. Cole. Hello. Mrs. Cole. I've heard of you. Oh? I understand you've got a hankering for my land. You're right. Well I'm sorry to disappoint you. You paid off the loan? Yes, I sure did. Well. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Congratulations. Welcome to Hope. Thanks. Mrs. Cole. Good day. Now you didn't really expect them to come back, did you? Didn't you? 'Course not. Well then why in tarnation didn't you tell me, Bill? Well I figured you was old enough to know better. Sam, Sam! You come back, Sam Potts! Come back real soon! Dirty no good bandits! Are we almost there, uncle Jim? Yeah, are we almost there Big Jim? Gypsy, how many times have I told you not to call your father Big Jim? That's his name, ain't it? Gypsy. Well, ain't it? That's your name. Whoa. Jim, what a start. A fight the first 20 minutes in town, a note to pay off, and now this. This is our home, Angie. And it'll be a good home. 'Cause this is good land. You'll feel better come morning. A lot better. Jim! This is our land, Angie. 640 acres of rich, wonderful land. You think we'll know what to do with it? Oh you bet we'll know what to do with it. We're gonna raise us some fine cattle and maybe 10 or 12 more kids. Oh I love you, Jim. I love you so much. Oh! Here kitty. Nice kitty. Ooh! Out. Oh Jim, you can't. Out! Take a good week before that skunk oil wears off clean. The harder she scrubs her, the gamier she's gonna get. Ain't that the truth. That old Duncan. He's sure a lot of animal, ain't he? Yeah he sure is. Can raise us a fine herd. We ain't never gonna have to chase no more sinning rascals around the country, are we Jim? No sir. 10 years of minding the law is long enough. And Sam. I was mighty lucky to have a deputy like you. Aw shucks, Jim. Probably caused you a lot more trouble than done you good. Didn't I? Nope. Sam, that a leaning axe or a using one? It's a using one. It's a gol dang busted rooting tooting using one. It's hard wood, ain't it? Our father we thank thee for this home and the food you've given us. We thank thee for each other. And please help us to live our lives more each day as you would have us live them. Amen. Amen! Amen. Whoa! Well, things looking better already! How's it going Jim? It'll take some time, but we'll get her done. Mr. Benson, I want you to meet Sam Potts. Howdy, Mr. Benson. How do you do? Oh, I'll keep a swinging, Jim. Certainly nice of you to drop by, Mr. Benson. Cotton, everybody calls me Cotton. Oh yeah. Getting into April. Just about time for old Satan to start stirring. Yes, just about that time. Old Satan? 1,500 odd pounds of the meanest, wickedest animal this side of Hades. Sounds like a grizzly. Looks like a grizzly. But folks around here beginning to think he's the devil himself. Well, I've had truck with grizzlies before. They won't give you any trouble unless you ask for it. Old Satan don't wait for no invitation. He comes around looking for it. Winchester 4440 ought to take care of it. It hasn't yet. You've seen him? No, I been lucky. But I've seen his work. He kills just for the wicked fun of it. What about traps? That devil's busted up every trap that was ever laid for him. He gets the bait out, too. If that beast ain't Lucifer in person, he sure is first cousin. He's got the heart of a cougar and he can out think any man ever born. You better believe that. Speaking of the devil, if it ain't Jed Curry. He likes to get what he wants, and he sure wants this land. Don't let him spook you. Oh, nobody's gonna spook me, Cotton. I'm here to stay. Greetings! Boys, right here. Thought we'd drop by and have a friendly chat. And a refreshing friendly drink. Best in the county. Almost two months old. Two months? The booze bandits! This is my whiskey. Bought and paid for. Anybody gonna pour a drink, it's gonna be me. Now, any of you fellers like a drink? What is this man, some kind of a lunatic? Careful with the bottle, Tad! Sam, what in the world is the matter with you? Now look what you've done! Look what I done? Why, hold it Sam! Tad. Cut it out. Simmer down, Sam. Now what in the world's this fuss all about? Them two low down skunks cheated me out of a bottle of whiskey and $10, that's what it's all about. Why I ain't never seen you! Boys! Give the man his $10. Pa, I ain't got... I said give the man his $10. You smell like a skunk. Go help your mother. I don't like him. Git! I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that right now. I'm sorry about the drink. I'm sorry about the trouble. Wouldn't have been no trouble... Sam! Go back to work. It's a pitiful thing a man can't protect his own booze. Boys. Boys. Wait in the surrey. You know, this place used to be mine. Kind of like to have it back. Of course, don't look like much now. Take a lot of money and a lot of time to make it practical. If you're interested in selling, I'll give you top dollar. What do you say, Mr. Cole? Cash on the barrel head. Well thanks for the offer just the same, Mr. Curry, but I'm just not interested. I haven't got a lot of money, but I've certainly got a lot of time. Maybe you do. Maybe you don't. Well if you change your mind, you let me know Mr. Cole. Mrs. Cole. What's the matter with you ox heads? I want that land. I want it for you boys. Now don't make no more trouble! Last couple of days just ain't going his way at all. Well, good luck folks. Now remember, if you need anything just holler. See ya, go on. Well, I know we got a winner. Already got a buyer, want to quit? It's like you said, Jim. It is our home. I don't think I'm in the market for selling it. You give me another week and you won't know the place. You just won't know it. Hey! Where's that good looking feller? Who? Potts. That there Sam Potts. Ain't he a friend of yourn? Oh, Sam, yeah. Well you tell that rascal I'm coming out to pay my respects. You do that now, won't you? Oh yes ma'am. My name's Wilhelmina. That Potts calls me Bill. Well Bill, I'm looking to buy us some stock. You know anybody'd be willing to show me around? It'd be worth a dollar to me. I sure do. Get out, Hank. Come on.

They told me this badge was solid gold along with my six gun saddle and the other half of Duncan. And I can borrow enough money to buy us another bull. Jim, that star means so much to you. You and the ranch mean a whole lot more. In that order? In exactly that order. Well, I'd best get going. Is that Duncan? That's part of him. That old Satan didn't do Duncan much good, did he?

To Big Jim Cole, a law man and friend. Many thanks from his neighbors of uintah county. Hi Rosebud. I need me some candy. Thanks, champion. Don't mention it, Rosebud. Well Jim, I figure $75 for the whole shooting match. I'd like to make it more, but this ain't my money to play around with. Sure, I understand. How much do you think I could buy a good Hereford bull for? Hazel Squires has one. I think she's asking 100 for it. That'd still leave you 25 short, but I reckon I could make that up out of my own pocket. I can't let you do that, Cotton. Hey, you ain't got no choice, Jim. I guess I haven't. I sure appreciate it. Well, where'd you get that? From the champion. I'm helping Hazel bring out your stock this afternoon. Well I'm driving out there. Would you like to come along? I got to pick up a bull now. Thought you had a bull. Oh I did, Satan killed him last night. Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Yoohoo! Mr. Cole! Oh good morning, Bill. Say I think it's just about time I paid my respects to Mrs. Cole. Would you kindly tell her I'll be moseying out this afternoon? Oh you bet. I'll be sure and do that.

Oh, well I guess that's a pretty good reason. Get up. Benson! What did Cole want? Old Satan got his bull last night. He needed money to get another one. I gave it to him. Oh. Oh I suppose that is the collateral? Yeah, that and this. Ah. Benson, you see that? That's collateral. All collateral. For various loans around this town. Now is that any way to run a bank? When folks get in a nest of trouble ain't it kind of a bank's duty to help 'em out? Well, seeing as how I am the principal stockholder in this bank, and seeing as how it's my money you're loaning out on that kind of collateral, I want it stopped. But Jed, have we always made out all right? Especially I want no more loans to Jim Cole. If he wants a loan, I'll give it to him for a mortgage on his property, you understand? Yes, I understand. And we take no more collateral like that from anybody. But Jed. From anybody! Good day. That's Potts. Them ain't the cleanest things in the world, is they? That's the Greek god? Ain't he?

Just kind of dreaming, I guess. What about? Oh you, the ranch. And Satan. Jim, I'm scared. You're going out after him, aren't you? I figured Sam and I would take a look around up there tomorrow. He's a savage, senseless killer, Jim. I've known men like that, and even worse. But there's a difference. It's his territory up there, his land. He knows it and you don't. And this is my territory, my land. I'm not gonna let him take it away from me. Mr. Curry said he'd pay us top price for it. Is that what you want, Angie? I want what you want. It's getting late, Jim. He doubled back on us! Jump, Sam! Dirty, no good killing devil! You got him, Jim. I knew you got him. I don't know. Angie! Angie! Did you get him, dad? Yeah, did you get him Big Jim? Well I don't know. I put a couple of shots into him, I know that. Well you're gonna know. You didn't get him, he's gonna be more peeved than ever. He's got your scent now. If he ain't dead, he's gonna come looking for you. We're not waiting. We're selling and getting out of here right now. I can't do that, Angie. I can't quit now. That bear's hurt bad enough to be dead. If he ain't dead, I'm scared enough to stay away from him. Maybe he feels the same way about me. Sam, you look awful. I feel terrible. Evening Cotton. Welcome folks. Evening, good to see you. And a prosperous and happy harvest to you. Thank you so much. Howdy! Howdy! How are you? Everything going all right up there? Oh just fine, thank you. That bull know what you bought him for? Yes, he certainly does. Well that's real nice. How'd you like the coat Sam? You ain't got no call to give me no coat, Bill. It ain't decent! Silly boy but beware the Greeks bearing gifts, Sam. Beware, beware. Oh, thank you sir. Well, I got me a bit of waltzing to do. Come on, Cotton. Let's you and me shake a leg. How about you and me Mr. Cole? Shall we, Mrs. Cole? Good evening. Mr. Curry. Well, summer's over. Going to be a long, cold winter up there. I'll give you $1,000 over the going price.

Nope. Never seen fireworks before. That fireworks Charlie? Are you gonna sit and stare all day or are you gonna ask me to dance? Can't dance. You can't dance? No ma'am, but I'd be real proud to get you a cup of punch and well, maybe we could just sat a spell. That sounds nice. Yes ma'am, that sounds nice. That sure sounds real nice. Allow me.

Suit yourself. Now Mr. Curry. Cotton told me you might be willing to make me a loan. Made it out this morning. Care to look at it? It's a loan for $500. Is that all right? For a section of land with house and barns? Well now that's the best I can do, Mr. Cole. However... Leave it. Don't do it, Jim. You get in any more of a bind up there you'll be in real trouble.

You're looking for him, I ain't. Well, I could get him for you. How much? Three bucks a pint. I figure you just downed about a buck and a half's worth. A buck'll do it. How about another little jolt? You hear me ask for it? My, oh my! What a beautiful brace of dogs you got there. Just beautiful! They'd have you for breakfast, they heard you say that. I'm Jed Curry.

So I can explain what you're up against. Sit right here. Well, howdy Angie. Hello Wilhelmina. What can we do for you? I need me some piece goods. Maybe a new dress will give my spirits a lift. Never fails. Say, I've got me a new bolt of calico that I thinks got a real chic look to it. Good to see you again, Angie. What are you doing here Cass? Well ma'am, I'm here to kill me a bear. How's Big Jim, Angie? You stay away from him. Give him my best, ma'am. I gather you don't think too much of Jim Cole. You gather wrong. He's a good man. Don't ever underestimate him. Let me say, uh I gather you and Jim Cole aren't exactly on handshaking terms? Now you got it right. I'll make the reward $1,000 if you can get that bear before Jim can. Why? I don't think that matters. I think it does. Without that reward, Jim will lose everything he owns, everything. You got yourself a bear. Like some information. Who knows most about that bear? Jim Cole. That's good. That's real good. Cass, Cass! Hi Cass! You've grown, boy. Grown a yard. Never could understand what that boy ever see'd in him. I guess a bounty hunter's life seems pretty exciting to a youngster. Charlie's the only human Cass ever took a liking to. Been a long time. What do you want, Cass? Just a chance to say hello. Pay my respects. Well you said 'em and paid 'em now get. I've got work to do, Cass. Anything else on your mind? Understand you know a certain bear's habits better than anyone else. I'd like to ask a few questions. Well you can ask 'em. That doesn't mean I'm gonna answer 'em. I figure to get that bear and I don't intend to make it any harder for myself. That's right. Heard you needed that reward money real bad. Matter of keeping your ranch. Don't blame ya. Nice place. Chances are we meet up there. Some place. Cass. You try anything and I'll see you hang for it. Need another piece of meat, Sam. Ooh whee, that is ripe. Well the riper the better. If this doesn't kill our scent, nothing will. Camp about a mile away and see what happens. Jim? Yeah? What if we catch us that bear. Now that'd mean half that reward money'd be mine now wouldn't it? Yeah, I guess that's right Sam. That's good. That's real nice. 'Cause when I throw my half of that money into the kitty it's gonna make me feel like I'm part of everything. Like I really belong. You know, Jim, like I'm paying my own way. Sure. Sure, I see what you mean. Goodnight, Sam. Huh? Goodnight, Jim. That's for Becky you murder son of Lucifer! Did we get him, Jim? I ain't gonna make it, am I? Sure you're gonna make it, Sam. No, I ain't never gonna get to wear that fur. I ain't never gonna Jim. Sam? Yeah. You better go bury your dead. He was a good friend and a brave hunter. Give him mountains to climb, forests to hunt, streams to fish. We commend him unto thy hands. Goodbye Sam. Hank I'll be going out come morning. I'd be obliged if you'd stay with the family. I'm sorry ma'am. Real sorry. Ready to quit? The bear's got most of our stock, got us into debt up to our necks. Now it's got the best friend I ever had. And next it'll get you. I guess that's what it boils down to. It's either him or me. Jim Cole you're a stubborn mule. If you think I'm gonna stand by and watch my family murdered one by one by that beast, you're just not thinking right! Don't be mad at dad, please don't. Oh Charlie. We've got to get away from here. We just have to. Cass. Come on in, Cass. You're slipping. Just a mite heavy footed. Coffee? Yeah. You know what it feels like to walk a six by three foot cell for two years? Just about kill a man like you I guess. What I did was in line of duty, working for you. And you testified against me. You killed an innocent man, Cass. You shot him down in cold blood. It wasn't the first time. You were lucky with the others, they were guilty, but you guessed wrong this time. You took two years out of my life. Now I'm gonna make you pay. I'm gonna see you lose your ranch. I'm gonna watch you walk away from it busted, flat broke, and beat. Besides, that bear killed my dogs. Cass? Stay away from my traps. You having trouble with your traps, Jim? You're accusing me? Why you're the fellow who said a man was innocent until proved guilty. Ain't that what you always said, Jim? I'm saying stay away from my traps, and I ain't gonna tell you again. Gettin' old, Cass? Maybe a little rheumatism, or the boots are just too tight. Twisted my ankle. Funny thing happened to me today. Set a trap for a bear. Caught myself a skunk. Well, I'll catch that bear tomorrow. That's a shame about these boots. That one's plum ruined. Ah, one ain't much good without the other. I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna cut you up and use you for bear bait! You got troubles, ain't ya champion? Hog tied myself for a fare, Rosebud. Bedtime, Gypsy Yep, it's getting to be about that time. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight honey. I thought by moving here we could run away from trouble. Things don't ever change much, do they Hank? Trouble just seems to follow us around like a shadow. Shucks ma'am, things are gonna be different from now on. You'll see, Jim'll bring in that bear and... Jim's never going after that bear again. We're leaving here Hank. Well you can't mean that. I do mean it. I spent ten years down in Utah. Ten years of fear, wondering when Jim was coming home. Wondering if he was coming home. Having nightmares about him lying dead somewhere. I can't take it anymore. I won't take it anymore. Every man's gotta have him a dream and this here's Jim's dream. His heart sure is in this land, ma'am. Sure is in it. I love my husband, and I'm not going to stay to bury him in this land he loves. All you can think about is that devil. I'm going out again in the morning, I've got to. You go out in the morning, and I'll be gone when you get back. If you get back. You can't mean that. It ain't only us, there are other folks involved. You're just tired. You bet I'm tired. Tired of being afraid for ya. Tired of being sick to my stomach fearing for the children. Angie, we're gonna lose everything we own. We're gonna lose this place if I don't get that reward money. I want to lose it! I'm sorry we came here, Jim. Angie. Dead sorry. It isn't only that bear. Cass is out there right now just waiting for the chance to kill you. Ain't a man alive that hasn't got trouble. How he handles that trouble is what counts. How he goes looking for that trouble is what makes him a fool. Angie, in every man's life is a Cass or a Satan of one kind or another trying to whip him, beat him down, destroy him. He can't run away from it. He's got to stand strong and fight, whatever it is he's got to fight it. That's how god made a man. And god made a woman to need a man. In your life there's an Angie and a family. That's right. And that's exactly why I'm going out again come morning. All right, Jim. You've made your choice. Goodnight. Where's Charlie? I can't find him anyplace. Solomon, look! Jim. I'm afraid it's my fault. Charlie never heard us argue before and I knew it was bothering him. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like I did. Now, take it easy. He can't have gotten far. I'll catch up to him. Come on. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Take a man's boots away from him, will ya? That's about as low as a man can get! Until they bury him. Cass, Charlie's up there! Ain't never gonna get past me. You hear me boy? We lost his trail, Solomon. I think maybe we lost ourselves. Cass, Cass help him! Charlie, get back up there! Stole my boots. Stupid kid. Big Jim and Charlie! Uncle Jim! Put me down, put me down. Come on, Gypsy we got him mom, we got him. Charlie! Oh, Charlie.
