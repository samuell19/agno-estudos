All good We humans are considered the most intelligent species We are seven billion Our ingenuity and progress seem to know no bounds But technology has not long since overtaken our humanity In what world do we want to release our children? Science can now simulate the Big Bang in the largest research project of all time We play God Mary Mary Mary Mary Here are you They are all looking for you Hey not so fast, wait a minute. My dino Stop dreaming So and now off to your kindergarten teacher Promise is promised, ten minutes, more is not possible So Hello children You have already learned something about our particle accelerator But what you can see now Only very few people are allowed to see that So come with me Man, Jana, I did not tell you to count the children, even if you have zero motivation to do your internship particle escalator particle Accelerator The press also calls it God's machine This is the biggest machine humanity has ever built Bigger than the USS Enterprise? Bigger than a city And today we finally started it again Lee, lead our guests into our inner sanctuary, yes? Yes, come with me This way, slowly Because it's you, ok Andrea? But in five minutes, the rascals must be out, yes? We have our particle accelerator - the cannon if you like Made stronger in the last 16 months than ever before Since seven o'clock we are shooting particles at each other again Atoms We let them collide So let them run into each other Because we want to find out What really happened at the big bang Does anyone have any idea what the big bang was? Yeah, that's where I was made, Mom said Yes That was certainly one too But we want to know what the world consists of We look over the shoulder of God, so to speak We run a little unsteady at 14 tera electron volts That settles down Leave it at that level for another ten minutes So, I have to get back to work I hope you liked it We'll also look at the data center yes? Are you coming with me? Come Come with me Children we have to go They cut themselves off now Awesome right? Huh 300 top, 350 hp, 3.8 liters Yes, our good Tin Lissy looks a bit old against, or brother heart? Rico the cucumbers come right from the field, we have to unpack the pallets Yes, our good Tin Lissy looks a bit old against, or brother heart? Rico the cucumbers come right from the field, we have to unpack the pallets Where were you half the day? At Rainer's? Did he lend you the car? Lent? We need more boxes Mr. Galitzki Do not fool me You did not buy that Yes I can indeed spend my profits wherever I want Yes There Or there Profits are reinvested do you understand? In cucumbers or what? No In your future Mom and Dad taught you You return the car You know what I won't do shit Mom and Dad were trapped here all their lives A life for the cucumbers A life for the ass Fuck off The yard is buzzing without you What the hell is that? Rico Rico Rico Crap Hey, I'm calling an ambulance I'll get help Next is the report on the air pressure isobaric diagram of 27 September Polar Jetstream North Atlantic for 1400 MEZ average 110 knots and 300 hectopascals Clear Air Turbulence expected between the Faroe Islands and Iceland And another day with unimportant data and endless boredom We have a problem at the measuring stations There is an increased value almost everywhere Did you check that? Yes the values are half a point above normal Ogdei? Can you continue? I have to change my clothes Ah fuck Ogdei! Did he catch you? Cleanly tacked Will do I'm late I'll be back in three hours We'll do it We have the plans Come Beer tonight is on me But now just imagine I get the job Office instead of dust More salary And finally a new apartment for Jana and me Don't you get along with your daughter? We fight, every day Two rooms just are not enough Jana sits in the kitchen with friends every night and She is 17 now, at some point I have to offer her something Man Weber, if they allow late bloomers like you build houses I apply to a small architecture office It will not take long for me to build houses, so do not worry He has to go now Mr. Peters He signed up for the half-day holiday last week He can only go to his job interview when the construction is finished here You approved that last week Mark, Mark I'll be back in three hours Haah You do not even need to come back, Mr. Weber [Explosion noises] Where is the chancellor? Over there Thank you Yes If our efforts are successful What I expect, of course Mr. Chancellor Excuse me 'Sorry Yes I'm on my way I have to go to Berlin Immediately I apologize I want you to collate that with the Americans Do you have the data from Cape Canaveral? What about Peru? The have little contact because the satellites are hardly reliable .. I do not want to hear such nonsense, or else I get kidney stones We have to verify everything or else we'll never know why we lose contact with the satellites There! That's already the fourth Damn what's going on I want to immediately put all the crap here on the table the satellites have sent in the last few minutes before contact loss Go! Go! People that's something other than weather data evaluation for once Gerd you get on the phone and call the Ministry of Defense Whether there's some military crap we do not know about Contact lost to five satellites now You created the gravitational field analyzes there So? Well, what are your calculations showing? Something is wrong Are these the current gravitational values of the earth? Yes, latest state From the European Space Agency? Yes Mr. Bonhart these are way too high I see that myself Guys, shut up now Shut up ~~I am here in the ruins in front of the Reichstag~~ ~~Currently it is completely unclear what exactly happened here~~ Oh my god ~~Currently it is completely unclear what exactly happened here~~ Oh my god ~~ What we know is that five satellites have been taken out of orbit around the world ~~ ~~ We also hear about chaotic conditions from Spain ~~ Oh, shit ~~ At this stage we do not know exactly what happened ~~ Bark Bark Bark ~~ The helpers do their utmost to recover and care for the injured ~~ ~~ All the surrounding hospitals have their emergency rooms on standby ~~ There is a gas pipe! We have to get out! I'll be right there Here are injured everywhere Where are your parents? ~~ Firefighters, Red Cross and other rescue services work hand in hand in search of survivors ~~ ~~ It is still unclear how many people are still missing who were in the entrance area of the Reichstag at the time of impact ~~ Hello Mark, I do not know what to do with Jana You have to talk to her now Ahem is not a good idea now Something happened here and um Are those fire brigade sirens? Oh God, what's going on? 'Saul good What is it with Jana now? She is struggling I do not know if that will work Maybe you should get her back home I should probably do that Maybe you should get her back home I should probably do that You're right Wait a second Andrea, I have to go back, can you handle it? Yes Listen, brother I know you have been fighting since she moved in with you But maybe just because you do not know each other anymore You just have to spend more time with her Can I speak to her? Your father Hey you ass 'sup? Good idea of you to just deport me here It's really shitty here I want to visit you and have a talk with you Idiot Jana? Jana? The performance increase is phenomenal Gravitational curve is good We will get a nice amount of new particles 15 tera electron volts and runs stable Lee? Everything in the green Then we'll drive it to full load now One and a half years tuning for this one moment Do not disappoint us! Get a move on! Are you mental? Wasn your problem dude? It was his fucking idea that I do this fucking internship Now let's all go to the candy vending machine Cmon Listen to you talk Jana Mark is still your dad Crumbs! Mark would do anything for you That's what he said to Mama and we both know what came out of it Sometimes I wish he was dead GRAVITATION WHEN PRODUCING MICRO-BLACK HOLES Let's hope I'm wrong Fuck 99% performance achieved, still increasing All Parameters ok, System online Magnetic induction stable Collision in 100% power maximum achieved Go WOoooooooohhhoooooooooo We made it! The origin of the universe! Congratulations gentlemen Oh my God Lee!! Come on! All to the front! Go over to the kids! [Children screaming] Ey Tobi can not do that. That's theft Two laptops Alas, that's procuring research funding Besides, such an electronics market is insured, is not it? Yes, can you get it ready? Sure, I bring along too About Tropical Island Are you sure that Sabrina will come along? Yes, definitely She's even bringing her friend along Hey, I'm telling you, dude, she's sooo hot Ey she talked about you in the chat the whole time And besides that lives in Berlin For her the Tropical Island is almost at the door She's got her eyes on you Eh Yoshi Anyway So Yoshi wait a sec What? Dude I think I got it What? You really cracked a data packet of a collider project? How did you do it? No idea I just made my computer available over the Internet to them Dude, do not stay there too for long Hey the Collider guys, they are not to be joked with They just send the cops after you Yoshi, you are totally paranoid. The cops? Seriously The moped behind the house, is that also stolen? What does that mean you sent all the doctors to Berlin? We need help here We have been waiting for an hour Now listen.. Up yours Don't get upset. I just stay here and wait It's going to work out, little brother Like the doctor comes and Then I'll take care of you Sleep till then What, what, what's going on in your fucking head You are on probation Do you really want to go to jail? I have a shop in town I'm here for the people and my son is making raids Get yourself together, dude Calm down, Siggy Calm down Siggy I do not want you fighting here Listen The prosecutor will have a look at it first, okay? And they decide how to proceed, ok. Tobias We got something So that it is clear I'm talking in there, it is my head on the line, huh? You are also welcome to wait outside As you say You just work for me Not more Mr. Chancellor Mr. Braunhag, Mrs. Ritter So, you can tell us what's going on here The scientists collide particles with other particles This creates extreme high energy densities It looks like the colleagues at the Collider have created such a gigantic density That a black hole was created A black hole? Yes And? Of course that was not planned Something must have gone wrong A black hole has such a high gravity First the satellites in the LEO So in Low-Earth-Orbit And then in the MEO drop Please shorten that What do we have to expect? There will be more crashes First the satellites This will cause the GPS to fail Aircraft are hardly controllable without navigation So you have to block civil aviation first Yes A black hole is nothing more than a point in space with so much mass That nothing - not even light - can leave it Pure gravitation That means tremendous powers are released Excuse me, may I? Obviously, the black hole in the collider is relatively stable But Earth's gravity has been increased by 0.5%, and the trend is rising That does not sound like much, but it's enough to get the satellites' orbits out of balance So the black hole will grow The gamma rays ionize the atmosphere, creating an electromagnetic pulse Yes EMP that is to be feared Same thing as in after nuclear explosions This EMP destroys almost all electronics in Germany Everything that is turned on and unprotected is literally roasted So that means that cell phones, computers, cars become unusable The gravitational waves and the EMP are only harbingers Nobody knows what comes next Even the smallest increase in gravity leads to tensions in the earth's crust and can thereby burst the underground gas pipelines This can lead to earth faults or earthquakes Are you serious? Yes Ah c'mon Why should a small research accident in Switzerland lead to tectonic movement here, huh? Yea Cuz Because the collider is the eye of the hurricane In the middle it is relatively quiet But we We are completely hit by the vortex Exactly And the storm is just building up I simulated all this as a worst-case scenario when I was still working on the Collider project Expect the worst ~~ At the window! ~~ [Jet noises] Bloody hell [Jet noises] [Jet noises] If your theories are correct, what do you think I should do? Turn off the collider. Immediately ~~ The reports from the capital are getting ahead of themselves ~~ ~~ According to our latest information an airplan.. ~~ Hey, that's disabled parking Hey, hey, hey. Do not beg our guests here, yes. Begging, master? I earn my money with something else I wanted to tell them that this is a disabled parking space Hobo! Hey, that's bad for Karma Told you so Come on, Ria turn your phone back on again ~~ ... Incident has occurred on the collider ~~ ~~ Contact to the inside of the research facility is lost ~~ What's that? What? How do you turn it up? Where is the volume? ~~ Preventively evacuate ~~ ~~ Eyewitnesses report ~~ Crap ~~ A strong explosion that shook the entire Collider Building ~~ Oh my God ~~ A strong explosion that shook the entire Collider Building ~~ Oh my God ~~ At the time of the accident .. ~~ Oh my God ~~ At the time of the accident .. ~~ Ogdei! What? I need your car. I have to go to Geneva for this collider Now? Ja All the nuclear power plants are shutting down. Good And the collider? The Swiss lost contact The site is still running The Swiss lost contact The site is still running What? The collider is still running? They didn't shut the particle accelerator down? They can't do that without shutdown software The data center is destroyed Oh, shit Oh God Oh, shit Oh God OKOKOK Distributed Computing Very good, that's a possibility. Wait. Yes it's me. That's networking with privately owned PCs Yes it's me. That's networking with privately owned PCs We need an IP Yes, everything that went in and out of the Collider project Yes, I am waiting for that. Ciao Yes, the Collider project relies massively on the computing power of private persons who signed up for an account If someone got sent this shutdown sequence, then you can upload it locally to a computer at the Collider and stop the particle accelerator Is' our only chance So in simple terms We can not stop the experiment alone, but someone has received the power-off button Perhaps We can not stop the experiment alone, but someone has received the power-off button Perhaps Exactly You have ten minutes to tell me who has this button We are looking for a political solution, you talk to the Swiss I hope they let us into the country In any case, we must leave no stone unturned Maybe she can get the shutdown sequence and upload it We have to have several options What? I? No, just determinedly no I'm not flying to Switzerland for an upcoming EMP, by no means Issue her a license to kill. She gets every help she needs I wish you good luck You can do it I need your car, they say all flights are cancelled And now you want to drive a 621,37 miles across Germany? I need to go home How do I explain to them what just happened? What's up? Sophie! Mark! We keep your mission secret until further notice The allies are not informed Ja? Ja. The IP Where? Huh Very good, yes Got it Someone actually got, heh, the data packets with the shutdown codes Some guy from the Black Forest Calls himself Skull666 Some nutjob He probably does not even know what has ended up on his computer Black Forest, that's at least on the way to Geneva Then send me the address to my mobile as soon as you have it, yes? Yes OK OK That's okay Sophie Good luck. I am serious And thank you very much OK All the best bye With a short stopover in the Black Forest, she can be in Geneva in four hours Then we should pray that she manages to shut off the juice to the collider Are you going to Geneva? Are you flying to Geneva? Mark Let's go as long as the radio network is stable I'll come with you Out! What the heck?! No way you are coming with us, get out damn it I beg you! I have to go to Geneva We have to go We only have this one slot The entire airspace is about to close I won't get out again So what now? We don't have time OK We take him with us Your decision Go! Mr. Galitzki? We have to go now Yea Home Yes, it's ok Saul good Erik Comes. Hold on tight to me OK Saul good OK Andrea Do not worry kids, I'm not leaving Oh God You are doing well Where.. Where is Mary? Here! Here she is She is here All right, Mary Yes, bring her here Take care of the children Jana? Jana!! Now listen Ms. Körner, the political objective is to put pressure on Switzerland So that the problem can be solved from there But that's exactly the problem of the particle accelerator project It is neither under the sole control of Switzerland nor under that of France How can it be that the collider is located in France and Switzerland and does not belong to any of the states? The project is funded by twenty states but legally it is an autonomous area It is through Ground forces The Swiss want to advance with troops to the Collider to send a salvage command in Listen! I do not want a thousand pages of state treaty. Bloody hell The French see it the same way Switzerland is to open a corridor so that German troops can march in there The few Swiss military on site are a joke Frau Görner "Marching into Switzerland" do you hear how that sounds? Trust me, Kollberg Tell the chancellor I'll advocate for it Oberleutnant Brünner! Shall we go in and look for survivors? We are waiting for order from the staff Till then: scout and secure Sophie, what happened in Geneva? I do not have time to explain that to you, we'll drop you off at the next opportunity, ok? I know it was shit back then But talk to me. Please! This just came through the radio The guy from the Black Forest stole a car and bailed Oh, shit However, the BKA has located him with the credit card of his father About half an hour ago he used it to pay for tickets to Tropical Island Tropical Island? What's this? A fun bath in Brandenburg About twenty minutes flight from here OK, then you're flying there, right? Are you sure? The boy is the only one who has the key to turn off the collider Shit, s-shut off what? Sophie talk to me Just shut up for five minutes What happened down there? There was an explosion down there, the experiment is out of control We lost all contact Is the worst possible time to want to go to Geneva Jana is down there Your girlfriend? My daughter! Your daughter? I have a daughter, she's with my sister Got an internship in the company kindergarten Your daughter is with Andrea? Yes If the two were at the particle accelerator at the time of the explosion , then She lives, I know that Please fly me there immediately! First, we need the shutdown sequence, without which no one has a chance And how long should that take? You have to be able to stop such a fucking experiment, just cut off power and finito Just like that, yes? And you stop a bike by putting a stick in the spokes, dude wake up! This collider has to be shut down in a controlled manner, no way around that Why did not you never tell me that you have a daughter? She lived with her mother back then. There was never a chance to explain it to you You never had the opportunity? Clear Ionization of the atmosphere The EMP Go down We have to get down, we have to go down, go down What is going on now? We have to get down, we have to go down, go down What is going on now? We can not land anywhere here Buckle up! Damn we are too low There was a complete hundred behind me They have surrounded the whole village with pigs I broke through there only to get to you So so Buggered off Bad boy Let's see if you have the balls to pull off the naughty things from the chat Ey! Come quickly Man over here, yes What? Now I got you Sabrina? Come on, let's see ~~ It is still unclear how many people are still missing who were in the entrance area of the Reichstag at the time of impact ~~ ~~ It's clear there is little hope for many of the buried ~~ ~~ There is no doubt that it was a satellite that has fallen into the Reichstag ~~ ~~ After the crashes of the satellites there are massive failures of the mobile network throughout Europe ~~ Do you see? The invasion has begun What? How did that know? Tell me ~~ First banks had to close in Frankfurt ~~ Tobi? Yoshi should the aliens really eat Tobi as a virgin? ~~ The cause of the satellites and plane crashes is still being debated ~~ ~~ We have prepared a short clip about this ~~ Sophie Sophie Come here Come here Come here Come here Come here What do you want with that Who knows what it is good for You won't tell me what's really going on The EMP was only the beginning Now the quakes are coming What quakes? Are you saying earthquakes are coming? No one knows exactly what happens But the black hole will also affect the Earth's interior If the tectonic plates move only slightly, the impact will be catastrophic A dream area ~~ People are still debating .. ~~ Nightmare reception Modern piece-o-crap Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Heinrich please At your age, you can not be disturbed by news We do not want to get upset Yes certainly Yes, certainly we want to get upset The muck here is one thing but I really can't endure this without radio ~~ we do not know how long we can still maintain the broadcast operation ~~ ~~ Germany is facing an incredible catastrophe ~~ What's that now? Crap Thoral? I am here Have a look at the fuse The fuse looks fine, Billy Refrigerator is off as well Eh here guys, the stuff has to go, that will get warm otherwise Praise the sun That's a blackout First the mine, then the power plants I told you so Stop complaining that won't fix nothing Gheez, Willy, just let it go We were done a long time ago Where do you see this done? Fairy lights are not hung Beer pump isn't ready And pasta salad isn't prepared either I do not mean that Willy, that's enough for a whole company, yeah wat the heck Willy I mean us The Schalke buddies The club is dead Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead Listen, no one is coming for the anniversary Nobody is coming? They all come, they always do Get up if you're a Schalke Get up if you're a Schalke Stand up Willy, wait a minute Willy, man man man Willy, in the end you'll have to do everything yourself Just take a look around Last year, how many showed up? Eight? Do you think this year will be better? Willy, get in your RV and head off to Rimini, man And blow your compensation with your Rosi I'd rather go straight to the nursing home The only real disaster is how Schalke currently plays, everything else we can fix He just does not get it, Zoran. Now tell me something Awh crap Shit Zoran? Yes, what was going on, had to fart? The jugo has to digest the German pork knuckle *burp* So, shaft free again Schulz Oops, the alien invasion has begun Crap Of course, mobile phones stopped working Forget it Forget it, the EMP has completely destroyed the electronics It doesn't have no electronics That means if the EPM didn't deep fry the battery then it will start EMP EMP How far is it to this Tropical Island? No idea Maybe, pff, 12 miles Then we get your little hacker and drive straight to Geneva Cmon, get in Damn Karl! He has heart diseases Has been taking pills for months Let me in, take the flashlight Slowly slowly OK That's okay The cooling vent! You have to plug it, otherwise we freeze in here Let me be No, I will not let you be Even if you are still bratty Look at me, I got you into this, you understand? I wanted to go on a trip with the kids and I will bring them back All children You, too You're right You got us into this Luckily those are not your own kids down here Oh, right, you don't have any children of your own Because if you had any You'd know that children are not at all interested in research shit And then those kids would not be in so damn deep shit right now I'm curious how you want to get us out of here Out of the sixteenth basement of this fucking labyrinth What is the old fart doing? No idea Maybe he builds a new radio because he broke the other one A Radio, are you crazy? This is an FM transceiver with a 110 watt frame grid transmitter tube Not a half-baked semiconductor rubbish Anyone have any schnapps? The thing hasn't been assembled since Stalingrad They cashed my Williams last week Mirabelle, I smuggled it past sister Ingrid Do you have glasses? Wait a minute, help me Please open it To the Middle To the tit To the scrotum Zack Zack What is going on there ?! Na Well, can we get blazed with the ex-virgin now? No cell phones, no electricity, I would have somehow imagined the end of the world to be worse Yea No electricity means no circulation pump That means at some point this huge pool tilts. And then the water starts to rot I tell you Man Yoshi, dude You can really kill any romance That is madness Look Tobias Hölder? Skull666? Hey Hey I do not want that with the cop, really I'm sorry Hey, we are not here because you are wanted It is hell out there and you're the only one who can stop it Where is your laptop? What? Where's your laptop? Why? Because the laptop holds the key to that, you understand? Now pull yourself together and come with me Yes, it is in Schiltach And where is this shithole? Crap Crap! Calm down! We need something to drink Karl What about you? The ventilation has failed The air, we are too many in here, we. Karl, what? The kids have to go The Oxygen, that's math We all are gonna suffocate Karl Listen, you have to calm down We can do it My heart pills, they are all used up And? No way up through the data center Ist kaputt The stairway.. Buried Children, here It is delicious and very good So Gone Gone it is Where is it? There it is Do you see Dude, can you cut me free of this shit, it hurts like a lot Got it? You have cut off my blood circulation Stop bitching, better be safe than sorry No shit, that's it I'll make you shut up Mark! Please stop. I think I think you're exaggerating, ok? Please Please And I think it's better you take off the shackles, yes? So and now you can stop the car you old hag. Geddit? I am on probation. I'm not going back to that fucking shithole, okay? I have a criminal record. And I'm certainly not going to jail Can you shut the fuck up already? This is not a video game damn it Oh, well, you old fuck listen up now Even if you have two honks get my laptop Forget it! You do not get the data anyway What do you mean by that? Well, I encoded the entire disk with a sixteen-round A256-bit based two-fish algorithm Dafuq? Not even the NSA can crack it Can this be? Yes. Yes that can be $#!7 OK OKOK Listen, I uhm I let the laptop get picked up by the Bundeswehr and then we meet at the Airbase Holzdorf And there you will then decrypt the data Dork Hey, hey! Stop! Stop it! Shit, where is he? ~~ After the crashes of quite a number of traffic jams the catastrophe reaches for more and more technical areas ~~ ~~ A pressure increase in the underground gas piplines led to explosions in many places ~~ Alright, come on Crap Oh, shit Help, quickly! We need a doctor here! We need a doctor You there, you there Hey, my buddy needs an appendectomy or what do I know. He needs a doctor There is .. I have no idea Listen, where's Rosie Wieczorek? That's from our buddy Willy He has to be somewhere !? Oy Sit down here. Sit down Buddy stay here, ok? I'll get help The THW gives us three hours - watch out - to clear the hospital They say the gas line under the building is a ticking time bomb Alright, well, I'm talking to them But now I'll continue in Four, Three, in Three with the burns Dr. Penzberg, we have heart surgery in the Four And I need you in Two for an amputation now What? But We need a lot more doctors We can't ever do this alone I have already phoned. We can't ever do this alone I have already phoned. The readiness will be here in an hour And we do not have time to discuss You are only a nurse here and can't order me around! 'Sorry I believe in you Rosie Rosie! W-w-wait a second Rosie! Rosie! Andy! Rosie Something wrong with Willy? No! Zoran Oh man uh Hey pal what's wrong? What's the matter? We left Willy's, ya Zoran and me Then we went to the gas station And wanted to drink a PBR on the way And then he just collapsed in the parking lot He has abdominal pain. Real bad Here Yeah, that .. ..that's an appendix You see, I have to evacuate first Where to? I am sorry The cooling pipes are failing Things are freezing over The world's biggest refrigerator's got a leak And we freeze to death We have to get to the surface It's blocked here And here What do you think? What is behind that? Meter thick reinforced concrete That should have held Then we have to get through there Pass the control room Let's hope that the staircase or the elevator shaft are still intact Are you insane? The control room is located directly in front of the black hole We have to risk that Who knows if the black hole even still exists Maybe it collapsed It is still there You know that very well Belzheim Heheheh Everything in there is secured against EMP and earthquakes That's the only way out Or do you want to freeze? That's suicide There is a lot of radiation from the black hole and we have no idea how our bodies react to it Gamma radiation! Microwaves! You will kill us all Think about what you are doing with the children who consume our air Phew! Karl, damn you! Pull yourself together The kids are already scared enough We are stuck here and freezing Your fucking quarrels will not get us any further I bet my brand new diploma that he is somewhere near and trying to steal a car again You can really not crack the code on his laptop? Two-Fish? If it's true what he says no I should not have given up so early in the Collider project at that time I have not worked there since fall Didn't you know that? I've taken the side of the popular scientist at my PhD That's what they said They have no room for nutcases in the team Why nutcase? I expressed reservations about the experiment and calculated a bit Calculated a bit? Like back then When you've gone through all the hyper-square tables half-naked on the computer all night Mark I warned that a black hole will be created that we can not control anymore I was sucha idiot then That's a waste of time The collider is history All satellite data say 82% of the building complexes are destroyed Yes! The part above-ground But a much bigger one is underground Maybe this continent is breaking, my God And I will not let Britain get torn up Why do we have the B-61 in service? A nuclear weapon !? A bunker buster The energy will cause the black hole to collapse We estimate the contamination to a maximum of 15 square kilometer You will not throw an atom bomb on Switzerland! Listen: A nuclear warhead will feed the hole and enlarge it Pah I want a vote Now! Eh you!? What are you doing there? Get off the bike! It's good, calm down Do you know what I do with lunatics like you on my farm? Yes? Let go! Let go of him! Get the fuck off my farm! Go away! Piss off Stop! Hey! Hey! Calm down! Back off! Sascha! Hey! You won't get flee again, understand? Both of you make me fuckin sick Hey You know what? You can't compete with my bratty daughter. I've been through way worse What do you want here? This bloke here And his fucking laptop What's this? A fault The result of a research project in Geneva They really managed to turn the world upside down We need a vehicle It's great. We can chug with a trekker to the the Black Forest We're completely cut off. We don't stand a chance on the road Not on the road You can't be serious, right? Our former fertilizer flyer Another hobby of my brother Is this thing still operational? Can you fly it? Sure Is as old as the Land Rover The disaster has spread to the whole continent Reports of plane crashes, major fires and earthquakes reach us everywhere Central Europe is hardest hit The picture you see here comes from the Polish border The earth is torn up here on 70km What's that Bornack? Can you explain that? This is the beginning Fault line due to the distortion of the Eurasian plate Sophie Ritter was right Europe is breaking up Be prepared for everything Kolber? Spain and Denmark also report seismic shocks Göttingen and Heidelberg need to take massive action against marauding gangs In Leipzig there were looting And the abort sequence? We lost contact with Mrs. Ritter Where she is, if she has the sequence no idea Yes, then she is dead Who says that? Thanks Mrs. Gerne joined Bad news The Security Conference has voted in favor of the bombing Yes NATO is taking command When? The bomb? 50 hours That's the time you need to evacuate We must prevent a mass panic, Mr. Chancellor Prepare a speech ~~ Whole industrial plants are ablaze. The land is from disaster ~~ Where is Zoran? ~~ Whole industrial plants are ablaze. The land is from disaster ~~ Where is Zoran? He's in the hospital With your wife He has an appendix Looks like shit You're not serious? Sot! He looked like shit this morning I tell ya Listen What's that supposed to be when it's done? Gonna drive to the countryside with Rosie and Iflops There are whole treks on the way Is safer there Here from the World Cup 2010, it's yours now Wait, wait, Willy You, you can't leave just like that For real The Zoran has an appendix He needs surgery He'll miserably die a wretched death In Germany, nobody dies of a ruptured appendix You are just too dense to get it? First Berlin, then Hamburg, and Frankfurt and now Gelsenkirchen Germany as you know it, that's no longer exist If you do not help Rosie, then the Zoran will die Do I look like an MD? Willy, now listen Willy, you are our boss here I thought you are our boss Did you remember when we were trapped in the coal mine for three days? Hm? You kept the boys together You gave us courage Without you we would all have mangled ourselves Jeez! Willy We still have to evacuate a hospital What hospital? What kind of hospital? Want me to build you one? Want me to bake you one?

No idea Certainly she's fine Jana is alive Most certainly I really thought that you and me Are something special Then you just left Without a word Talking was probably never your strength, right? All right then When we first met I had been separated from Jana's mother for years Suddenly it turns out she has cancer But she did not want me to take care of her I should've still done it anyway because of Jana Anyway, she was dying and I was not there I was with you in Geneva And that's why you left I wanted to see her again But I was too late Jana has been living with me since then And blames me every day that it was my fault Is not easy with her since then, right? Anyway, that's the reason why I left back then We should go on, maybe um Maybe you can ask Willy if he can somehow get us a car Maybe we can put Tobias down there somehow Without him, we just can not do it Maybe Willy has a solution We are now a reception center What are you doing there?

That is the core of my belief And it took me till now to understand In a gym Allah's ways are often mysterious What do you think Allah has in mind with us? Why does he do that to us? He does not do that to us We do it to ourselves This happens because we want to be like God In reality, we are just like little kids who .. play with a chainsaw We have no idea how powerful God's Toolbox is You're right (formal) You're right (informal) Thomas Erdinc The engine is beyond saving How's the progress? Now just let us be, ok? So I remove the Two-Fish encryption. And then I decrypt the disk OK But takes a while How long? No idea. With that amount of data.. 1-2 hours Can't you split the packages? In smaller pieces Then we could decrypt them in parallel on your machines Is already running You aren't too crazy for someone your age Guess that was a compliment, right? So. Data decryption is running After that you can take the computer with you Do you have any idea how we get out of this dump? That's what I'm wondering since my baptism Was ment as your birthday present Is good for off-road Let's hope your computer can shut down the collider I'm sorry, I ... You do not want to know how much shit I pulled at your age I was not always a jammed anxious family man And your philistine shop? When does it open again? Loading all shelves, the whole stock Forget it Then let's clean up Mark, pull over Sophie what is it? They are going to bomb They what? A bomb. They.. They launch a bomb at the collider in Geneva You are telling me now? How much time do we have left? Two and a half hour And? The elevator ropes are ripped But one floor up there is a staircase that seems to be still intact We tried to get up there with a fire hose, but It does not work No chance We can't get up We are stuck here We'll think of something We will all die No No, that is not true Get up Should I tell you what we are doing to get out of here? What? We climb the shaft, like Spiderman I know that you are all scared Me too But if we made it this far Me too But if we made it this far Then we can do the rest We'll get out of here Every single one of you We'll get out of here When I was little my dad always told me stories when I was scared Of Poo, the bear. Do you know that? That's a small cuddly bear Who goes on funny adventures And he lives with his best friends The piglet And 'IA' the donkey in a huge forest Let us through We have the shutdown sequence. We can turn off the collider This is a restricted area. Turn around! They want to drop a bomb on the collider We know that. Turn around! This is not just some bomb. It has a nuclear warhead It will enlarge the black hole even more I am a physicist, I worked at Collider. I know the experiment This anomaly eats up energy It will erase everything Everything By contrast, this bomb is a joke OK Try it Give signal when the collider is stopped Thank you Keep in touch with us Good luck We withdraw Zoran? Zoran Never again pork knuckles Stop it with your fucking pork knuckles So? What is it Willy? The battery lights will soon run out of juice And the emergency generators are so hot you can fry a egg on it The cooling pumps are also clogged Those stopped working hours ago Gheez! The ventilation The oxygen is running out Without oxygen it's game over in here We can pack it up then What do you want with that? This is a vascular prosthesis for a bypass He does not need a bypass He doesn't, but If the pump is clogged, the problem is bypassed You lay a new channel Oh, shit Is that the only way? Yes I'll go ahead That can crash at the slightest shock You ok? Yes Now the shit hit the fan I guess Let me through quickly So? And? What should I say to the people outside? I've changed all filters Diesel pump is running This is just can't be Fucking piece of shit I literally put a bypass Damn it Willy! Willy stop! That solves nothing Well then you do Its working again? OK come Slowly Slowly Slow Slowly And? Are you making progress? If that holds, we'll get up one floor It looks like the stairwell is still intact Good Erik? Erik wake up you have to move Eric wake up, wake up, wake up Wake up Wake up to Eric Is he dead?

You get the others to safety And I will upload the shutdown sequence, ok? I'll come with you No I'm going alone, ok? I can do that It's ok Children go to Lee Can someone hear me? Does anyone hear me? We're down in the collider now. You've got to call off the bombing Were you able to stop the experiment? Not yet Here are children I'm sorry but I have my orders. I can not do anything Here this area is EMP safe A few computers must still work Then you can dock and feed the sequence Turn around You have to get us out of here. There are still people here Can anyone hear me? You can not just leave us behind Can someone hear me? Hold tight! OK Jana I now pull the ladder to the next floor As soon as it's fixated you come after it, ok? I have to give a signal outside The bomb is on the way We can do nothing more Big Ship 01 starting approach on the Collider Target contact in five minutes Big Ship 01 confirmed Unlocking weapon systems. Preparing for dropping the bomb Confirmed Bomb ready for dropping Roger and end Carefully You are all very brave now and everyone takes care of each other Very good Come on Do not switch off! Don't! I know what I am doing Go away No No No Abort! Big Ship 01 Abort! Abort Abort Negative termination is no longer possible Try to divert the bomb and disable it Deactivation not yet confirmed Our father who art in Heaven Blessed be Thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven Give us today our daily bread And forgive us our trespasses As we forgive those who trespass against us Bomb disabled Willy what's going on? Now do not look like a bucket of swede We owe everything to you pal You did it, dude! Come here, I love you Do not drink everything at once Still remember World Cup '90? I mean, it was a long time ago, but World Cup '90 It has never been better But Andy Today we were better Today we were even better Heheheh Today we were even better Heheheh Open up Are we going home now? Maybe we were too fast Maybe we wanted too much Maybe we were even technically able to replicate the universe To imitate the Creator and creation But our wisdom and our hearts were not Many people had to die The country we know In which we all live, is no more Germany is devastated And it will take decades to rebuild what was lost But We survived And life will go on Same shit as always People like us save the world and the others hold the speech Cheers This day will go down in history But not as an end But as the day Where we get up again The day we all get up together again This is our day This is now the day of German unity
