[police siren] [narrator] Frankfurt, 1964. In these prison vans are accountants, businessmen and pharmacists. They're accused of many thousands of murders, committed in Auschwitz concentration camp. The biggest trial in German legal history is taking place in Frankfurt. The matter before the court is the state's genocide of the European Jews. Twenty-two Holocaust perpetrators have to face their judges. [birds chirping] [mysterious music] [crowd murmuring] Auschwitz-Birkenau, a marshy district on the River Vistula in Poland. From 1941 on, a few thousand SS men implemented a secret German government project here: state-ordained mass murder. They killed more than a million people. [train braking and whistling] Day and night the German railways deported European Jews from the countries occupied by the Wehrmacht to the concentration camps in the east. Tens of thousands died even before the journey ended. And journey's end was Auschwitz-Birkenau. SS doctors selected those Jews capable of working they were sent to the camp, the others were gassed right away. One SS man took these pictures. They were submitted to the court as evidence. So was this Soviet film footage. [silence] The chief state prosecutor in Hesse, Fritz Bauer, had been working on the Auschwitz case since the mid-fifties. He inaugurated a process that encompassed the entire complex of crimes. Bauer, himself a victim of Nazism, wanted a German court to uncover the entire truth about Auschwitz. He wanted the Germans to be aware of their responsibility for the genocide. [silence] The press conference before the start of the trial: The Auschwitz trial is to show us Germans in Germany, but also the world, that a new Germany, a new German democracy, is willing to uphold the dignity of every human being. This trial is less about looking backwards and more about setting the tone for the future. [narrator] The twentieth of December 1963. A Christmas market in Frankfurt. Much was forgotten eighteen years after the end of the war. People looked after their families, their careers, their savings. Few knew what had actually happened in Auschwitz. That was about to change. A trial was to start in Frankfurt that would confront the Germans with their past. While the world was eagerly awaiting this trial, the Germans didn't pay much attention. [crowd talking] There was neither resistance nor enthusiasm. Life in Germany just plodded on. [jazz music] [narrator] Escapism after work, daydreaming at the bar. In the country of the economic miracle, the entertainment industry came up with suitable illusions. [jazz music continues] The trial was a signal that the German people would be confronted with what had happened a few years earlier. It hadn't been that long ago. [narrator] On the twentieth of December 1963, Hans Hofmeyer stepped up to the bench. The trial was formally opened. Four of the 22 defendants were about to make the headlines. Wilhelm Boger, an interrogation expert for the Gestapo in the camp. Josef Klehr, a paramedic and disinfector. Victor Capesius, the camp pharmacist in charge of the Zyklon B. And the main defendant Robert Mulka. A former member of the Freikorps, a right-wing paramilitary group, he'd been discharged from the regular army, accused of embezzlement. He joined the SS. He knew Rudolf Höss, the camp commandant in Auschwitz, from his time in the Freikorps. Höss made him his adjutant. In 1946 Höss was arrested by the British military police and handed over to the Poles. Convicted and sentenced by a Polish court, he was executed in Auschwitz. Mulka, his adjutant, was arrested as a wealthy businessman in Hamburg. He was able to stay out of prison after putting up bail of fifty thousand Deutschmarks. [mysterious music] Public prosecutor Joachim Kügler discovered Mulka by chance. Frankfurt's public prosecutors had spent years looking all around the world for the perpetrators of Auschwitz. They followed hundreds of leads, mostly to no avail. [mysterious music] Mulka was found when his son won an Olympic medal in Rome. [Joachim Krüger] When I arrested him, he tried to play the reputable businessman from Hamburg. He said at the start of the trial that he had been a soldier. [clearing throat] He wanted the court to treat him like a soldier who had done his duty. I stood up in the courtroom and told him and all the participants that he wasn't a soldier, but a member of a uniformed death squad. [narrator] As adjutant, SS-Hauptsturmführer Mulka was the head of the uniformed death squad, which was called in for special purposes. His three thousand SS men kept the Auschwitz killing factory going. A band of men, brutal to others, brothers to each other. Their camaraderie held up during the trial too. [silence] The public prosecutors submitted this document from Auschwitz as evidence. It proves Mulka's appointment as the second-most powerful man in the camp. All the organizational matters went through him... including this special order issued by camp commandant Höss. To avoid personal harm, the SS men were only to enter the gas chambers five hours after the gassing took place. Mulka's signature on this document proves that he knew about the gassing. Mulka was also responsible for acquiring the Zyklon B and for transporting the victims to the gas chambers. [crowd murmuring] The trial was now on the public radar, providing fodder for the tabloids. Mulka put Auschwitz in the headlines. In April, the court moved to different premises. [crowd murmuring] The new courtroom provided more space for the growing number of spectators, including many school parties. [suspenseful music] This is an exact replica of that court room. Filming was not permitted during the trial. But the court made an audio recording, which also includes Mulka being interrogated by prosecutor Kügler. [crowd murmuring] [Kügler] I ask you now, did you know that the people in the lorries were heading to the gas chambers? [Mulka] I was not aware of that. [Kügler] How do you explain that this was kept from you and that you're only finding out today? [Mulka] There was no reason to tell me because I had nothing to do with the prison camp and inmates. [Kügler] You're trying to say that when you were adjutant, you didn't know that the lorries were used to drive those destined to be gassed to the gas chambers? [Mulka] I wasn't asked about it. [Kügler] You mean you didn't know? [Mulka] I didn't know! [narrator] That was the tactic of all the accused. Mulka's lies made the headlines. Witness Josef Glück couldn't believe it. [Josef Glück] I read in the papers that the men say they didn't know what was going on in Auschwitz. Let me tell you that I already knew everything on the second day I was there. But not just me. This young lad, who was sixteen, Andreas Rappaport, he wrote with blood: Andreas Rappaport, lived for sixteen years. He called to me: 'Uncle, I know I have to die! Tell my mother I thought of her till the end.' This young lad knew what was going on and these men didn't? [silence] [narrator] A lot of witnesses spoke for the first time about their time in the camp. Hermann Langbein was responsible for getting more than two hundred survivors to Frankfurt. They trusted him. He too had been an inmate and for many years the secretary general of the International Auschwitz Committee. The hearing of witnesses began in February 1964. Frankfurt Central Station became the hub for all the Auschwitz survivors from around the world. They came from Israel, Poland, Canada, the United States, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. They all felt uneasy about setting foot on German soil again, reading German words and hearing German announcements on the loudspeakers. Hermann Langbein suffered with the witnesses. [Hermann] For many people from other countries, German was the language of the enemy. And when they heard German, their first reaction was to think that they were in the presence of someone who had done these things to them. That may not sound nice today, but it was the reality. Now you had these witnesses who didn't know where to sleep or where the courtroom was. They couldn't take a taxi because they couldn't pay for it. It was an intolerable situation. [narrator] The Jewish doctor Mauritius Berner, who now lived in Israel, came as a witness to Frankfurt. His wife and three children had been murdered in Auschwitz. On the way to the stand he had to reckon with confronting the perpetrators of Auschwitz. Several of the accused weren't yet under lock and key and strolled casually to the court as a group. [car horns] The SS dentist Doctor Schatz was also still free. He affably greeted the court security guard, who stood to attention and saluted him. The many witnesses that were called. And not all of them came, because they had no trust in Germany. Were put up in hotels and the accused were in the same hotels. The chief defendant, Robert Mulka, the adjutant of the camp commandant, was sitting having breakfast with them. I mean! I never understood that people, Germans, who had also been through a lot, could permit that. Private individuals, such as Mrs. Bonhoeffer, came and looked after them. How many witnesses broke down crying after leaving the witness stand because of having had to talk about their experiences? [narrator] The duty to speak out for the dead was also what made Doctor Mauritius Berner take the stand. He told the story of his family that came on one of the trains from Transylvania. [Mauritius] We quickly put our wives and children in their coats and got out. We were immediately confronted with an awful sight. [narrator] Dr. Berner and his family arrived in Auschwitz in the summer of 1944, during the Hungarian transports. The railways brought ten thousand people to the gas chambers every day. The court had these photographs of the murder of the Hungarian Jews as evidence. Doctor Berner had an unexpected encounter on the overcrowded platform. [silence] [Mauricius Berner] Two German officers came up to us. One of them was a tall, handsome man. I later found out that this was Dr. Mengele. Much to our surprise there was an old acquaintance next to him, Doctor Victor Capesius, whom we knew from Transylvania. He'd worked for IG Farben and had visited us doctors two or three times a year. [narrator] Dr. Berner still had the business card of the IG Farben representative. He gave it to the court. [car horns] Up until his arrest, Capesius lived an affluent life as the owner of a pharmacy in Göppingen near Stuttgart. The man who had been in charge of the Zyklon B was now in cosmetics. As the camp pharmacist, he gave Dr. Berner hope on the arrival platform in Auschwitz. A thought popped into my mind and I said to Dr. Capesius: I have twins, who need protection. I'll work as you wish in return for staying with my family. He said: 'Twins? Where are they?' I said: 'There!' He said: 'Call them back.' I called my wife and children. They turned around and I indicated they were to come back. Dr. Capesius took my twins by the hand and took them to Dr. Mengele. He told me: 'Tell him'. I started to but he dismissed me, telling me he didn't have time right now. Dr. Capesius sent them back to the row where I had called them from. I started crying but Dr. Capesius said to me in Hungarian: 'Don't cry, they're just going for a wash'. 'You'll see them again in an hour.' I'm still calling after my wife and children. I never saw them again. [silence] [narrator] An SS photograph used as evidence by the court: the morning roll call in the women's camp, the inmates before leaving for their workplaces. There are clearly adolescents in the group. They had to be at least fourteen to be picked for the camp, rather than the gas chamber. They were often forced to do awful things. [silence] One of these teenagers was Yehuda Bacon. He was deported from Czechoslovakia together with his parents, siblings and relatives in 1943. He was fourteen at the time. He's the only one who survived. Yehuda Bacon is now an art professor in Jerusalem. On the stand, he described the work the children had to do. [Yehuda] There was a cart and it wasn't drawn by horses, but by around twenty teenagers. We took this cart to all the camps and loaded it up. One of the jobs was to take the ash from Crematorium number three and scatter it on the icy paths in the women's camp B2C. Sometimes when we were finished with the work and the overseer was in a good mood, he said, Children, there's no one in the gas chambers right now. You can go in there and warm up. I, as a potential artist, tried to memorize exactly what they looked like. As soon as the war was over, I did these drawings. I think they were shown during the Auschwitz trial. That's the disrobing chamber and that's the gas chamber. This is the shower-head. That interested me because there were no real holes. There were big fans and a big shaft. The Zyklon B was thrown in from above. This was the disrobing chamber. The people had to take their clothes off. The SS man told them: Remember your number and hurry up, the coffee's waiting. [wind blowing] [narrator] On the thirteenth of December 1964 something unimaginable happened. In the middle of the Cold War a delegation from the court in Frankfurt, headed by associate judge Walter Hotz, flew to Auschwitz. There were no diplomatic relations between Poland and West Germany at the time. Auschwitz was a huge camp system that extended for forty square kilometers. At the center were former Polish army barracks, then the seat of the camp administration and the SS guards. When the camp system was extended, it was renamed Stammlager Auschwitz I. More than two hundred journalists from around the world attended. On the fourteenth of December 1964 the Frankfurt delegation set foot in the camp. The group wasn't just made up of judges and public prosecutors, but also of eleven defendants. And of the representatives of the victims, Henry Ormond and Christian Raabe. Herr Ormond and I submitted an application that the court make a visual inspection of Auschwitz, the crime scene. We had to state exactly what was to be proved as a result. Lots of questions came up during the trial where many said in their defense that they hadn't been able to see something or that something the witness had described hadn't been possible. All of these things were to be investigated during the visual inspection. A lot of things could be cleared up and refuted that way. [suspenseful music] [narrator] One thing that was cleared up was what could be seen from where in Block Eleven. Mass executions took place at the 'Black Wall' in the courtyard of this block. Tens of thousands were killed here by being shot in the back of the neck. It was found that this could be seen from Block Eleven. That confirmed important witness statements. [suspenseful music] This visual inspection was a turning point in the trial. Up until then more than 250 witnesses had testified in Frankfurt, but the only image the court managed to create of Auschwitz was based purely on words. Much remained unclear. It wasn't until the confrontation with the reality in the camp that all the participants became fully aware of the monstrous dimensions. Auschwitz was a death factory. [suspenseful music continues] Chief defendant Mulka had his office in the commandant's headquarters in Stammlager Auschwitz I. When he looked out of the window, he would see the gas chamber and crematorium. There's no way he couldn't have known about what went on there. There's a shaft on the roof of the bunker through which the Zyklon B poison gas pellets were poured. The gas chamber lay below. Next to the gas chamber were the ovens in which the victims could be burned without delay. The killing took place with the poison gas Zyklon B, a pesticide produced by Degesch, a company owned in equal measure by Degussa and IG Farben. The headquarters of IG Farben, the largest chemical company in the world at the time, were in Frankfurt. The construction of a huge factory in Monowitz near Auschwitz was planned. It was to manufacture synthetic rubber and synthetic fuel for the arms industry. In July 1942 the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, visited the building site. The SS was in business with IG Farben and provided the company with inmates as laborers. The Frankfurt court spent three days exploring Auschwitz. All the camps and extermination sites were visited. The final appointment was in the possessions store. [crowd murmuring] The delegation saw a huge warehouse: everything the deported and killed had on them was sorted, catalogued and stored. [crowd murmuring] The defendants were very impressed with what they saw, particularly with what the Auschwitz Museum had compiled. There were mountains of glasses, shoes, suitcases and other items. In retrospect, I regretted that not everyone in court and not all the defendants were required to see that. [silence] [narrator] The extracted gold teeth of the dead were particularly sought after by the SS men. Witness Rudolf Vrba came to Frankfurt from London. He'd managed to escape in 1944. He informed governments, the Vatican and the world public at the time about the events occurring in Auschwitz. [lawyer] Mr Vrba, what was your job in the clean-up squad? Our work started the next morning. The squad was marched to the effects chambers. The packages were ripped open and everything was sorted. Documents, personal photographs, family albums and the like were burned. Shirts, jackets and so on were carefully sorted according to their quality, as were women's blouses. The valuables were taken away in suitcases. There was a suitcase full of dollars, pounds sterling, reichsmarks, zloty, gold watches and things like that. The people were burned, killed and burned. The suitcases weren't killed or burned. They were treated very carefully. I had to ask myself: where are all their other things? They weren't the poorest in Europe. They had shops, houses, fields, cars, bicycles, radios, furniture. What happened to all the things they hadn't brought with them? There can be a big discussion about whether it was six or seven million Jews that were killed, but I can tell you for certain that not a single one was murdered without also having been robbed. Not one. [narrator] The raid of the Nazi state on the possessions of the European Jews was a taboo subject during the post-war era. When the chimneys were smoking again and the factories were working at full capacity and the economic miracle was in full swing, nobody asked anymore what had happened to their billions. Too many Germans had had their piece of the pie. This goal of the extermination policy was also raised in court in Frankfurt. The press started picking up on issues like this. The literary elite were to be found in the foyer of the courtroom. The New York Times sent the famous dramatist and husband of Marilyn Monroe, Arthur Miller, to Frankfurt. [crowd talking] This reporting had an impact. I don't know how long that lasted. But they were outraged about what they heard and read. There were many who didn't believe it, but they couldn't refute it. There were new revelations every day. I liked hearing Axel Eggebrecht's reports. We sometimes sat together and wrote these reports in the evening and afterwards we got drunk. Because, who can bear it? Even if you only have to write it down. [narrator] People were horrified by the reports about the Boger swing, an instrument of torture where the shackled victims hung over an iron bar with the backs of their knees, while they were beaten in the abdomen. [silence] Boger was notorious for such torture. His job in the Gestapo was to prevent inmates from escaping or putting up resistance. His office was in the barracks right next to the crematorium. That's where the torture took place. Women from the camp acted as secretaries. You can imagine that I saw a lot of awful things. The interrogations were with inmates who had fled and been recaptured. The Gestapo from Katowice sent hostages from the prisons or others who were suspected of having worked in the resistance movement. They were often shackled to the swing to make them talk. It was an instrument of torture that Boger had invented. I saw the inmates before and after. They were almost unrecognizable. Two days later I often got the document confirming their death. [silence] [narrator] Boger, the former police commissioner, enjoyed the torture. In the camp he was called 'the devil of Auschwitz'. [silence continues] After the war, Boger lived in Hemmingen near Stuttgart. He worked as an accountant and was a respected citizen. After his arrest, a reporter interviewed his wife. [reporter] Were you in Auschwitz together with your husband? Yes. [reporter] How do you judge the things your husband is now being accused of? I can't imagine that he did all of that. My husband was very precise, but I can't imagine that he murdered children and then just came home. We had children ourselves and he was a very good father. [crowd murmuring] [narrator] The court had now been in session for eleven months. [crowd murmuring] Then Erna Krafft from Aurich took the stand. She came to Auschwitz because she refused to work in a munitions factory in Dortmund. Once in the camp, Boger got his hands on her. There are moments when you don't care at all. Suddenly Boger stood up after this long interrogation and pulled out a whip from under his desk. He came towards me slowly. I was standing by the door. He kept cracking the whip hard in front of my face. Then he whipped me twice across the face. Any surviving inmates from Birkenau will confirm that when I returned, I was unrecognizable. If Mr. Boger is in the room and if he should be released and I'm alive, I'll whip him like that in return. [man] Defendant, Mr. Boger, rise. I would like to ask Mr. Boger whether he has anything to say to us in light of this terrible account. [Boger] No, I have nothing to say. [crowd murmuring] [narrator] One of the people sitting in on the trial was Frankfurt-based lawyer Manfred Amend, a close confidant of Fritz Bauer. The things that came to light were awful. It wasn't a place where you wanted to be. Fritz Bauer told me that he hadn't been able to sleep a single night without sleeping pills since the start of the Auschwitz trial. In one speech I heard him make, he started his account with: I've come from hell. [sighs] [birds chirping] [narrator] Block 20 of the Stammlager housed the inmate hospital. This is where the SS paramedics worked. Inmates infected with malaria and typhus were brought here. If more beds were needed, the weakest were identified and killed. The paramedic responsible for clearing the beds was SS-Oberscharführer Josef Klehr, a trained carpenter, who joined the SS in 1932. [silence] The Czech witness Imre Gönczi, who was a nurse in the hospital while he was imprisoned in the camp, explained how Klehr killed people. The patients got undressed in this small room. We had to write their prisoner number on their chest in blue ink. I had to take them down a corridor to the lab. There was a table between two windows and the SS man Klehr stood next to the table. A chair was prepared and another inmate who was working there sat my patient down. The SS man Klehr dressed in white like a doctor went over to the patient while the other inmate held him and injected him straight into the heart. He was dead immediately. Then we took him into the neighboring room, a bathroom, and laid him on the floor. I had to be there. And the SS man Klehr killed them all by injection. [narrator] Each one of these murders was recorded in Auschwitz's register office. The cause of death is listed as heart failure. The court had some of these death registers as evidence. For a 183 days the accused SS men had to listen to the Auschwitz witness accounts. Their deeds caused an outrage around the world. Not once did they express any remorse. On the nineteenth of August 1965, the verdict was expected. [crowd talking] The world was looking to Frankfurt with tense curiosity. Long queues were forming in the courthouse. The courtroom was packed. The presiding judge Hans Hofmeyer started reading the verdict, a process that would take two days. The court has been at pains to find the truth. The length of the trial and the amount of evidence that was heard confirm that finding the truth was the focus of this trial. But what was it really like in Auschwitz? Above the main entrance stood the words 'Arbeit macht frei'. But what it said invisibly was 'Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.' Hell started behind this gate. Hell, that is inconceivable to normal human minds. There aren't the words to describe it. Physically and mentally broken, robbed of their human dignity, these victims took their final breaths in the gas chambers of Birkenau. Jews and Christians, Poles and Germans, Soviet prisoners of war and gypsies, people from all over Europe, all of whom had a mother and all of whom were human: that was the Auschwitz concentration camp. [narrator] Of the 20 accused, Robert Mulka was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was released in 1968 on compassionate grounds and died in 1969. Victor Capesius was sentenced to nine years and died in 1985. Wilhelm Boger got a life sentence and died in prison in 1977. Josef Klehr was also sentenced to life in prison. He was released in 1988 and died shortly afterwards. [mysterious music] Fifty years have passed since Fritz Bauer brought the Auschwitz case to court. It was important to punish the guilty, but to reveal the truth about Auschwitz was yet more important. [mysterious music] It will never be extinguished. Like the memory of the deported and murdered on the countless memorial tiles outside their former homes. [mysterious music] But the file on Auschwitz has not yet been closed. SS guards at the former extermination camp are still living quiet lives in many German towns. [mysterious music continues] The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg still has much work to do. [mysterious music] Mountains of documents are piling up on the desk of public prosecutor Kurt Schrimm. If prima facie a crime has been committed, prosecutors they must prosecute. Provided the legal time period has not expired. [narrator] His work led to charges against the Auschwitz SS man Hans Lipschis, who faces trial in Ellwangen. Investigations are taking place in the case of a further 39 SS members. The 1964 Frankfurt trial left a deep mark on German society. And yet there remains great unease. The monstrosity of the crimes exceeds all human imagination. No court can do justice to that. [helicopter turbine engine]
