RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Don't tell me you're already at the office. Don't tell me you couldn't help stopping at the Oak Street Store. Guilty. So where are you? Walking to your office with a gift from Willa in four, three, two. I hope it's her famous hot chocolate. So what's up? Did you want the New Year, New You promo cards and the regional manager's meeting agenda this morning? Yes, I do. And can you leave a note to connect about the store's food bank tables, too? This week before Christmas is when we get the most donations. You got it. Hey, Willa said she wants to see you after your manager's meeting. Thanks, Kel. I'm just gonna head home to change and I'll be right in. See you soon. Bye. It's so cold! It's above freezing. Is it always this cold? In December? Yes. January, February, it's... much colder. But in March it's practically tropical. Like Hawaii? Not even a little bit. He wants to be able to go to Hawaii for the winter. We are gonna make it special, yeah? Alright, there's a cab. Grab your bags. Here I'll take them and put them in the trunk. Ok. Alright, organizers, phone, keys, bag, earrings... Oh, earring. It's just I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked my sofa cushions, on top of my fridge, inside my freezer because, you know, that one time, and still didn't turn up a match... So... please never leave me. Where were they? Actually, no, don't tell me. One in the coffee filter... Don't say the other, please. By the toner for the copier. No. For a woman as organized as you... I have a curse when it comes to jewellery. It just falls off my body. Manager's meeting in ten, I'll grab coffee. Thanks, Kel. Ok. Ok. There are my boys! Hey, mom. Let me get a look at you! I knew it. You're taller. Both of you. So, do you hug or is that not something cool grandkids do anymore? Oh, John! I missed you. And PJ. You know what I got inside, PJ? Some pancakes. Guess what colour. Red. Santa shaped. And tomorrow we're gonna have green ones. Christmas trees. And I can be talked into whipping up some cream. What do you say to that? Ok. Hey, PJ, aren't you gonna... No, it's ok. Don't worry about it. Sorry about that. He's really been going through it. Oh, hon, they've just been on two flights overnight and they just left the only home they've ever known. I'm surprised you're not all a little off. Mom, can I have some whipped cream, too? That's my boy. Welcome home, honey. - Come on in. - The place looks great. I am so glad you're home. The decorations are already up? Hey! Come on in. Come on in. How did your video conference call go? It was great. As promised, forms for Monte's wrapping paper drive. Perfect. I overbought for my girls. I overbought for your girls, too. Well, then they will be very happy to see you at Christmas dinner. Honestly, you've been the best host every year. Thank you. What is it that... that you wanted? Well, actually I have a side job for you... Good! You're here early, too. Scott? Margie. Come on in. Please, sit. Sit, sit, sit, both of you, and let me explain why you are both here together. Scott here has been doing an amazing job in the field with sales, but he hasn't spent any time in our corporate trenches. So we thought we would give him a survey of all the departments, starting with marketing, and Margie, we thought you would be the perfect person to give Scott the lay of the land. Are you up for it? Yeah. Good. Scott, we will make sure that corporate housing is made available to you so that you won't have to do that hour and a half drive back and forth, and you two can work side by side together through to the first of the year. Good? - Yeah, it's great! - Great. Excellent. Ok. That's it. - Ok. - Ok. - So, hats? - Have 'em. Gloves? On the list. Scarves? Earmuffs? What are earmuffs? Well... Here you go. What do you think? Nice. So we'll do a shopping trip tomorrow, maybe you could tell us where to go? I could come with if you'd like. Sure. And there's a tree lot right near one of the shops. I've been waiting to pick out a big tree so you guys could help me decorate. And we should go tomorrow, honestly. It's one week 'til Christmas. That's great. And if Grandma still has her traditions in place, tree shopping tomorrow means... - Cookie baking tonight. - Yup. Whether we're in Hawaii or here, traditions are traditions. What about our ornaments and our special family Christmas stuff? They should be here today. We sent all our ornaments and all that stuff we bought over the years special delivery. I will check the shipper's website to make sure. Ok. No, no, the boys can help with that. Can you guys help Grandma clear, please? No, no, no, no. You're my guests. Sit still. Mom. We help clear. Alright. And whipped cream with Santa pancakes isn't breakfast every day, right? Right, right. Maybe every other day. I heard that. That'd be great, thanks. Well, that was something. Did you know? I didn't even know you were coming to the office. I was gonna surprise you, after I figured out what was going on. They didn't even tell you? My manager just told me that Willa wanted to see me at corporate and that it was good news. Well, it is good news. They're grooming you. Yeah, but for what? Have you heard anything? No, I haven't heard anything, but it's only good. I mean, you're gonna be ready for whatever pops up. Starting with marketing. And you. Working side by side until the beginning of the year. So, after dating for six months, 90 miles apart, it's corporate that brings us to the same zip code? Well, if it weren't for this company we never would have even met, so cheers to more time together. I have a lot to teach you. We gotta go. Let's go. Grandma said we can get a sled. And that there's a market that has games and food and lots of Christmas stuff. After all our Christmases in Hawaii it's fun to be here for once, right? Yeah. And brand new pyjamas every Christmas PJ, My. We're definitely living here? We're not going back to Hawaii? Ever? Ok guys, what's going on? I think he's wondering, since your new job went away, if we're really gonna be living here or not. I know that this is new and maybe a little scary, but I'll tell you what else I know is that if I got one job I can get another. And we didn't just come here for work. We came here to be closer to mom in San Francisco and Grandma here. And you know how I look at things like this, right? As an adventure? That's my boy. Look at that. Now, grab your toothbrushes and... Our toothbrushes. We left them with the mover's stuff, not our backpacks. Grandma will have extras. What about my new one that plays "Jingle Bells" and lights up? You guys finish up, I'll head to the store and get a replacement, and while I'm gone call mom, let her know we got here safely, ok? - Alright. - Bye. So it appears I need to go out and buy a couple of toothbrushes for the boys. I've got extra toothbrushes. Not toothbrushes that play "Jingle Bells" and light up. Can I borrow your car? You know, I've got a better idea. Follow me. You should have sold it by now. Come on! When's the last time anyone took it for a ride? Well, I take it for a spin to pick up groceries once in a while. Mom. You should see the faces I get when I pull up to my book club night. I remember when your father bought it. He swore "I'm gonna fix it up. We'll have it forever." He would have loved having you back home, spending time with the boys. - Yeah. - Yeah. So the least you can do is take it out to pick up some toothbrushes. I've got job leads and phone calls lined up, we're gonna have our own place before you know it. Honey, you can spend as much time as you need. You know that. But in the meantime, it's the boys' first Christmas here and I've been looking forward to it ever since you decided to sell the business and come home. Don't forget to hit the dash. So how often do you go to the store? As often as I can. Just randomly, to scare the managers? No, I trust my managers completely. So you like going there? I do. I love our stores. You know, I actually spent all of high school and college working at our Oak Street location, where Willa was my manager. It's rare, you know, for someone to spend their entire career working for one company anymore. Yeah. But I honestly can't imagine my life without it. I mean, sometimes I feel like this place is my entire life but, you know, I have no plans to go anywhere. Well, I can't imagine they would let you. This is so weird. Yeah, but like fun, right? Yeah, like fun weird. Do you wanna go out for dinner tomorrow night? Or Thursday, or Monday? Right, because we can? - Yeah. - Yeah. Suddenly we can decide when we can fit in a date. Do you wanna do lunch right now? I can go down and pick up this cranberry and apple salad. I know this place that does it just in December. It's like red and green and all holiday delicious. I can go grab it and bring it back. That sounds great. Ok. And you need to keep working. Margie, I found your charm. I even put on all the jewellery you gave me. You don't have to threaten me with it. No, the Christmas tree one you gave me, for all of our future Christmases. The one that matches the ornament? Yes. Why does every piece of jewellery I own fall off my body? I don't understand, either. I love that charm. I love you. I love you, Margie. Nobody has ever said that to me before. Pat? Pat Godfrey? Pat! Look behind you! Margie? This is so crazy! How crazy is this? I saw the convertible and I just knew... I was driving it for the first time in years. It's been so long! What're you even doing here? I was gonna call you when I got settled, but... I'm moving back. You're moving back to Boise? I'm staying with my mom for the time being. I had a job offer but it kinda fell through. So you're moving from Hawaii to Boise in December? It's a new chapter. I sold the business there and now it's time to... Wait, you ran a business? If you put it like that. Well, I wouldn't except for in high school... You pulled me through algebra one, algebra two, geometry... Trig and... Ok! I found my thing in Hawaii. Adventure tours, outdoor gear... I did pretty well and got bought out by Triptik. Pat, that's amazing. Hey, wait. I have something for you. I always wondered where this went. Yeah, it was under the car seat. When I stopped short it just... didn't you drop it during prom? Prom, yes. Afterward, do you remember? Yes. You were always shedding jewellery in my car, in my house, at any restaurant we went to, the movies... Full disclosure, I still do. I am so happy to hear that, because I had this vision of you in my head as this fancy, put together business woman... Well now my assistant tracks them for me. Excuse me, your assistant? Ok, so I was right. Fancy business woman. Ok, so what's your title? Go ahead, brag. Regional vice president of marketing and promotions at Connor & Co. And Connor & Co. was smart enough to keep you around, and promote you. Congrats. Thanks. So I was just here grabbing some lunch to bring back to the office. I was just gonna grab some toothbrushes from the drug store. Toothbrushes? How many teeth do you have? I have two sons and their toothbrushes ended up in the shipping pod in the move. John and PJ, we're here together. You're a dad. So the four of you... Three of us. Divorced three years ago. She lives in San Francisco and travels for work so I'm the primary parent and it is amazingly amicable. - That's good. - Yeah. Well, it was really great seeing you. Congratulations on... on everything. Hey, you wanna grab coffee sometime? Sure. Yeah, just maybe after the New Year when everything settles down. Yeah, of course, of course. Here. Give me your number. There you go. Yeah. I will text you mine. Sure. And speaking of which, here. No, no, no. That is for you. It's waited 17 years for you. Thank you. Ok, well I'll I'll see you later. Bye. So, Margie Southworth, huh? Unbelievable, right? Yeah, it's amazing. How is she? She's a VP over at Connor & Co. now. Good for her. I always thought she had a good head on her shoulders. What? It's just that, of all the people on my first day back on an errand that I wasn't even supposed to go on... You know what I call that, huh? You know, I gotta get started on those phone calls. People are gonna head out of town for the holidays. And I've got cookie baking prep to do. You're gonna run out of sugar. Over Christmas? Never! I got a job offer, Margie. In Hawaii. That's amazing. For the whole summer? No, it's a real job. Wait, what about college? Well, I'd skip college and get started. A job in Hawaii is just something you can do until the real thing comes along. College is... Is perfect for you. But I need to be outside. That's where my future is. Come with me. Find out. Margie? Buy one get one numbers? Yeah. It's right in here. I'm actually gonna go to the Oak Street store for a bit. Checking the windows again or checking in with Carmen? Maybe a little bit of both. They moved Scott here? Yeah, temporarily. Or at least that's what it sounds like. And I'm training him. Face to face. No more round trip dinners, long drives. How do you think it's gonna go? Great. Why wouldn't it? Well, your whole thing's been long distance and slow, now it's every day in the office. That's a lot of expectation and pressure. We don't do that whole pressure thing, alright? It's very easy between us. Grown up. Grown up meaning you spend six months seeing each other once or twice a week having dinner, watching TV and talking about work? That is not... You've never really felt like he was the one who was meant to be. He doesn't give you that "I'll die if I never see him again" feeling. Carmen, that only happens in the movies. That's not true. Tell me you've never had that. What? Pat Godfrey moved back to town. Pat? From high school? Yeah, I ran into him in my car. You ran into his car? No, no, I mean, we were going to the same place at the same time and... You didn't come here to tell me about Scott, you came to talk about Pat. No, I didn't. He's got two kids. He's married? Too bad. Well, divorced. No, ok? It's been like two decades, we were teenagers, and listen, if we were meant to be we would have been. Anyway, you're biased, ok? Because you always thought we were gonna get married. I gotta go. Hey, stay away from my windows. And you thought you were gonna get married, too, Margie Southworth. Hi. Alright, here's another one. Where do snowmen keep their money? In a snow bank. That's my boy. Alright, perfect. Here they come. Ok. They're hot. Don't touch. How many do we get to eat tonight? None. These are for tree trimming. The tree won't mind. How'd the phone calls go? I made one, two, three phone calls today. Alright, you guys ready to get cleaned up? But dad... And then Sonny the Snowman. Yeah! Let's go, come on! "The moon shone bright on the last snowfall, "Sonny the Snowman spun around, having a ball. "The boys joined in amidst the flurry. "I can do this all night, don't you worry." That's some great reading, buddy. And we can make our very own Sonny the Snowman this week. You know how to make snowmen? I lived here for 18 years before I left for Hawaii. I'm a snowman making expert. Do you think our Christmas stuff will come tomorrow? The shipping company swore that we would have our special things in time. Love you guys. Love you, too. Goodnight. Sleep tight. The boys go down ok? PJ seems a little out of sorts. I just want everything to be the way it usually is for them. Hey, I was gonna go out for a bit, do you mind watching the boys? No, of course not. Take all the time you need. Ok. Thank you. Wha! Come on. I was just buying Christmas lights. Yeah, and I was... Oddly at the same place at the same time. Yeah. Are you looking for gifts? No, I was just looking... for a little bit of that Christmas I had as a kid. Hawaii's fantastic but there's just something special about... Snow? The place you grew up. Yeah. And you're obviously... Yeah, I promised myself I'd finally get my lights up a week before Christmas. Ambitious job. This is only half of it. The rest are at my house. And you're planning on hanging them all by yourself? Well, if you had an extra pair of hands I wouldn't say no. Wait. You rappelled down a waterfall with young children. Well, it was their idea. Wait 'til I tell you where we zip lined. Please don't say over a live volcano. It wasn't active... at the time. And you loved every minute of it. So much so that you built an entire business out of it. It's just being outside all the time and guiding people through amazing terrain for the first time or the 50th time and every day just being different. Aren't you gonna miss it? Yeah, I will. But everything changed in the past few years. Splitting with my ex, Casey, selling the business, my dad... I was so sorry to hear about him. He was such an incredible guy. I just thought, with mom being all alone and Casey being in San Francisco, that it was just time to... Start a new adventure? Yeah. Yeah. Your boys are so lucky. Actually, I'm the lucky one. Well, daredevil, think you can put in the final bulb? Spot me? Ok, but you know if you fall we're both going down, right? It's ok. Ok. You are my soft landing. Ok. Alright, well just don't electrocute yourself. The night is full of danger. There we go. Beautiful. Hot chocolate? Yeah. Ok. My candy cane ornament? How did you end up with it? I have no idea. I still have the charm, too. And you haven't lost it? Or the bracelet? Are you kidding? I would never let that thing out of my sight. I can't remember, what were the odds of us coming up with the same gift for each other six years running? Well, I am terrible at math, so... What do you do for the holidays? Your folks? They... they retired to Arizona. They were never big holiday people, anyway. Right, right. And they're doing ok? They are. They're not really big phone people, either, so I usually go out there a couple times a year. But you know my boss, Willa? Yeah. I spend it with her and her family. And you never married? Divorced? Ran away and joined the circus? No. No. None of the above. Although I-I am seeing somebody right now. He works for Connor & Co. That's great. How long? Six months. Well, I'm really happy for you. It seems like you've got a good life. Well deserved. Thank you. Well, I shouldn't have left the boys for this long on the first night. Yeah, and I have numbers to run, but I'm really glad we did this. Yeah, me too. Well, good luck with your move and your boys and your next adventure. Yeah, you too. I mean, with the stuff you're doing. Yeah. Good morning. Morning. Want some coffee? Biggest cup you've got. How long have they been up? Long enough to need a job. Rough on ya, huh? No, it's fine. I remember having one boisterous boy around the house. You could have woken me up. No, I enjoy it, honestly. And besides, by the time the pancakes are made all the ornaments I kept here will be sorted for trimming. It's a win-win. You are spoiling us, you know? No, you're spoiling me. I like having a little noise around the house again. So, I was asleep when you got back last night. How was your drive? I wound up at Margie's. You hung out with Pat last night? How was it? It was... Great. Really? Yeah, we had a nice time. Nice? She's got a terrific house. A lot of her decorations look just like yours. We hung lights, we got caught up... And then we... hugged. You hugged? Goodbye. It was good to see her, but my priority is the boys. And now I go back to my holiday crazy and... I go back to the job hunt... Life goes back to normal. Life goes back to normal. Hey, boys? Your mom's calling. - Yeah. - Hey Cas. Alright, it's mom! Guys? Here you go. Johnny boy. Hi mom! Mom, look at my earmuffs! I love them! We baked Christmas cookies with Grandma yesterday! And our Christmas stuff is supposed to come! Oh, my goodness. We've been having a great time. It's so much fun. Their boxes? No deliveries yet but it's early. Do you remember Michelle Shepperd in Seattle? Her son Patrick is in town for the holidays. You used to play with him when you were kids. Patrick Shepperd. Yeah. Well, he now works for the Seattle parks district so I thought it might be a good person for you to speak to. Shoot me his number, I'll give him a call. Great. Hey. How long have you been in? What's today? Kelly, it's almost the holidays. You can afford to relax. I'll relax after Valentine's Day. Twenty-five Christmas party games for the office party. I like the gift wrap relay race and Christmas charades. Perfect. Wait, what's this? Jane from Boise Home Outletters called you? That's... nothing. She's my position over there. Is she trying to poach you? I already called her back to tell her I'm not interested. Ok, because if someone makes you an offer please tell me. You know how much I value you. Thanks, Margie. Hey. I heard a rumour about what they might be grooming Scott for. Todd Cray might be taking another job. Wait, Todd Cray from the Midwest office? He has your same job over there. You think they're training Scott for Todd's spot? That office is in Indianapolis. He went to grab coffee. Ok. Thanks, Kel. Thanks. Thanks. Well, that was unexpected. Yeah. Would you leave Idaho? I don't know. I mean, it's an incredible opportunity, and my family is scattered all over the country, anyways. The only real tie I have here is you. So what would happen between us if I got the job? Well... We've been apart more than we've been together. Does that mean we're good at long distance or that it's just easier? I don't know. We've never really asked that question, you know? What if I'm asking it now? Hang on. New Year, New You meeting in ten minutes. Right. Look, all I know is that I actually really love spending this time together, which is the only way for us to find out, right? Right. Do you wanna maybe have dinner at my house tonight? I'll cook? Yeah. - Ok. - Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, if you hear of anything or anything opens up... Thanks. Merry Christmas. Everything ok? Yeah. Yeah. Alright, guys. Your old man is a pro at this. Watch and learn. Please, take a couple of these. Ok. Now, it's really like you're tossing a little Frisbee. That's it. You just need to get a little closer. Alright. Alright, hot cider, my treat. And then we pick a tree. Come on, guys. Pick a good one! ...not as many branches. Ok. Ok, I think we found it. It's not tiny. It's pretty tall. Morning calls didn't pan out, huh? Boise Adventures was interested until they found out about my winter weather experience. What? You skied when you were a kid. A teenage hobby is not work experience. Talked to Donnie at World Wide but he won't need anybody with my skill set until the summer. You remember Ned from the Boy Scouts? Oh yeah, he runs the um... the high school tours outdoors, doesn't he? He's all filled up. I'm running out of contacts fast. Something's gonna turn up, I just know it. Decca Print Shop's hiring. Where your dad worked? I could reach out to one of his co-workers, maybe get an interview. Is that really what you wanna do? Maybe if I land something now the boys will know that it's all gonna be ok. Maybe it doesn't have to be a perfect job, just a job. Look at this. Dad? I think we found it. Hey guys. Hey boys, let's go. - Excuse me. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. Hey. Margie! Oh, my goodness, look at you! You're still as beautiful as ever. And very successful, I hear. Isn't this crazy? I just came to get some vegetables and I ran... Now you must be John and PJ. You know, your dad and I have known each other since we were about... One year older than John is now. Is that right? Well, let me tell you, you are a lot handsomer than your dad was back then. Hey! And a lot nicer, too, I bet. Now, wait a minute. No, Lois, you raised an incredible son, but the day that I met Pat he nearly ploughed into me at the school dance. That's because you and Carmen slid to the left when you were supposed to... Slide to the right. Here we go. Right foot, stomp, stomp. Take it back now. You finally did it right. Well, I've been practising. Now, if you are buying a tree today that means you made cookies last night? Your grandma's sugar cookies and gingerbread. Yeah. You remember. I do. We eat them while we decorate. Do you wanna decorate with us? You know, tonight I'm actually... It's tomorrow. Dad even says there's enough snow to make a snowman like Sonny, too. Do you make snowmen? You know, I haven't in a really long time. We don't have our special ornaments but Dad said by tomorrow. What happened to your ornaments? They're stuck at the shipping company. I called but because of the holidays it's tough to get through. Yeah. Dad can teach you how to make snowmen. He said he's an expert. Tomorrow, huh? Any time after work at my house, of course. Ok. Let's do it. And what was the name of the shipping company? It's called Ship Shore. Ok. Eddie, I know you can make this happen. Can I call you back in an hour? Two? Ok, thank you. You're the best. Hey, could you do me a huge favour and pick me up one of those Christmas baskets and some mulled wine for me to bring to Eddie? Eddie in the mail room? Yes. On it. Thank you. And you've got... Willa and the 9:00 in two minutes. I'm just dropping my coat and I will be right there. So, Scott's doing well? Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if he's absorbed the whole department in the next two days. Yes, well, he's a keeper. And everything on the not work front? It's an adjustment. A good adjustment? Scott's such a great guy. Yes, he is. But that's not what I asked. Is this kinda like the time with Mark? Or maybe Ben? Or maybe it's more like Alex. Wait... Do you think maybe there's a pattern there? I have a pattern? Well, it seems like you never let anyone get too close. At least that's what it seems like. You don't see it? Not until you just mentioned it. Well, you'll get there. You have a lot of love to give, you just haven't found the one, and I have faith. Ready? I'm so stuffed. I kinda wish there was a way we could pack up the leftovers for the food bank. Well, I bought jams and honey and every item that I could find to donate to the Oak Street store. I think it's so awesome that C & C has a company-wide charity. Yeah, me too. It really helps tell the company's story, which our customers love, too. Is that your favourite part about the company? The story? Is that why you've been there for so long? I think I told you that I grew up with a lot of advantages. A beautiful home, a great education, but my parents were... Distant. It just really wasn't a very warm environment, you know. Right. I thought that's how everybody had it until I started working at the store. With Willa as your manager. Yes, and she was crazy supportive and just took me under her wing... And work became more than a job. Yeah, it became a home. After I graduated, my parents moved to Arizona and I became part of Connor & Co.'s story. Seventeen years later I'm still there. And you could never leave Boise. Or the company. Well, I could leave Boise... Dessert? Sure. Margie Southworth. Yes! Eddie, thank you! You're amazing. Ok, tell me where to go. Ok, great. Thank you. Margie! Can I help you with those? I'm ok. Come on in. You didn't really have to bring all that. I wanted to. Lois, your beautiful home. Thank you. You can just put those there. Ok. These are a little heavy. So, snowmen first and then we trim the tree. - Ok. - Come on. Roll! Come on, you can do it! This is a lot harder than I remember. Can I be on head duty? It just seems a lot easier. Come on, I'm on the head. Sorry. Ok, John, you gotta flatten the top so the next one doesn't roll off. How come you keep telling everybody what to do and not doing anything yourself? Wha? Yeah, Pat. How come? Wha-no! No, wait! No. We're doing this! Gotcha, Dad. We are not... I am not doing this. We are making snowmen. Are you gonna fight back or are you just gonna stand there? Hey, family! Anybody for cookies? Ok, what do you think? Genius. That's so cool! You may now eat your cookies. Ok, let's celebrate! Inside because I'm so cold. Ok, so before we decorate the tree can I get you two to help me with something? John, why don't you take this one, and PJ you take that one. Now, they might be the two missing boxes from Hawaii. Margie. Well, I work in national retail. We have a few shipping contacts so I did a little tracking down. These are our baby ornaments. Hey, your tree topper. My mom made that when she was a little girl. I was really afraid I'd never see it again. Thank you. Now it feels like Christmas. Thank you, Margie. That looks great. Remind you of old times? - Margie, try this one. - Yeah. Looks great, Dad. Hey PJ. PJ go grab that... There, that's perfect. Where should I put this one? My present ornament. You kept it. Yeah, I kept all the ornaments that matched your charms. You can't throw away fate. This looks great. I love this ornament. There we go. Just like home. That looks beautiful. It sure is. It's great. These were always my favourite. My mom taught me how to make them. And you taught me. I can't tell you how much it means to us that you were able to get a hold of our family treasures. It was my pleasure. You know, I don't think I realized just how many of your traditions I carried forward. Like what? Like I do wrapping paper doors, I put candles everywhere... And I buy myself new Christmas PJ's every year. You know, I-I just really never realized what the holidays could be like until I met Pat and he brought me to you. Well, you're welcome here any time, honey. Thanks. Yeah, yeah. You too. Thanks. That was dad's friend, Mike. They might have an opening. He says hi. Well, say hi back. Job options. At Decca? I'm just exploring. No, but you're adventure boy. Oceans, mountains, showing people amazing terrain for the first time or the 50th time. Sorry. Boys, mom's calling. Mom? Yeah. Hi mom! We made a snowman and a snow-woman! We'll show you. PJ, come on. I should get going. Margie... It's late and... yeah. Ok. You should just have this time with your mom and your boys. I don't wanna intrude. It's not... You have this whole life and I don't even know what we're doing here. We're just catching up. Are we? Look, you have two young kids and an ex and you just got here. You have a wonderful job and a guy that you're seeing and I am not trying to come in between anything. No, neither am I. It's just... What? Doesn't this seem like... What? It's just... the snowmen building and the tree decorating and acting like no time has passed. You know, this isn't... like, we're not... Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that we can't even see each other? We're bound to bump into each other. We always do. Yeah. I hope it goes really well for you here. And I wish you a really merry Christmas. Scott and I will just spend more time together, and... Margie. Maybe he's not taking the job in Indiana. Maybe I should just give us a better chance. Is that what you want? Hey, what are you really struggling with? What if I had followed Pat to Hawaii all those years ago? What if I never went to Hawaii? I could have survived here, taken a job with dad. I would have had more time with him and you. Think of all the things you wouldn't have had. I just wish... You know, it's time to buckle down. Focus on why I came here. You know, taking responsibility for the kids doesn't mean you have to give up on what you want for yourself. I have a meeting with Mike Willis at the Decca Print Shop tomorrow afternoon. If he has a job for me it's the right thing for the kids. I hate hearing you talk like this. Will you at least call Patrick Shepperd? He's been in your field, maybe he has a job lead for you. Mom, I'm gonna do the right thing. Thanks for staying up, mom. Hey, kid. It's four days 'til Santa delivers. What're you doing out of bed? You ok? Are you sad you went to Hawaii? No. No. Without Hawaii I wouldn't have had you or your brother, and everything in my life is better because the two of you are in it. Come here. I promise you everything is gonna be ok, PJ. Do you trust me? Alright, go to bed. When will that agreement be signed? If we're uprooting our senior people at Christmas time then we need to let them know. Yes, you told me last week that you'd have all the paperwork finished by now. It's not fair to make people wait. Hey. Hey. I just found something out. Todd Cray isn't leaving his job in Indianapolis. That rumour that we heard, it's not true. Well, then who's position are you being groomed for? Nobody else in marketing is leaving from what I can tell. Wait, you don't think they're having me train you to take my job? Well, Scott, that's gotta be the reason. What else could it be? There's gotta be a better explanation. You said yourself they're rounding out my education. Have they told you what other departments you're assigned to? They haven't said anything. But, you know, something else could be coming up. Hey, I didn't mean to... You didn't do anything, but I gotta go. Thank you for the heads up. Margie... Great. Pat? - I'm Pat. - I'm Pat. Patrick. That is confusing. I usually use my last name since I run into this but they spell Shepperd in so many ways... Hold on, did you say your name is Patrick Shepperd? Am I in trouble? No, no. I'm Pat Godfrey. Our mother's... Are you kidding? We haven't seen each other... Since we were nine, ten? When I broke my wrist. I was just gonna call you. I heard that you work for Seattle parks district. Yeah. I've been running tours and outdoor adventures in Hawaii for the past 17 years. You're kidding. My job is coordinating with the private tour companies and charters. Do you have a minute to talk? Yeah. Alright. Alright. Cool, man. Hey. You out already? Yeah. I'm gonna go down to the Oak Street store and help Carmen break down the food bank. Margie... Listen. You know that call from Boise Home Outletters? If working for one company your whole career isn't your path please take the interview, ok? Don't worry about me. And there was Patrick. I know, I couldn't believe it, either. He knows so many people. One of them might have a perfect job for me. In Seattle. That's the thing. I just got here. I uprooted the boys to Boise, and even if there is a perfect job out of this can I relocate them again? And away from you? Do you remember what I used to call impossible coincidences that seem to be an answer to a wish, or something held in your heart? That's Godwink. Yeah. So you're saying that me seeing Patrick in the coffee shop is a Godwink? Both of you at the same time ordering coffee in the same shop in the middle of Boise where he's visiting and you've just moved back after 17 years. Well, I guess if you put it that way. I mean it. I believe in these events. You know, bumping into Margie again and again and again. Hang on. No, you always seem to wind up in the same place at the same time, even back then. And now? After being apart for 17 years and 3,000 miles? Pat. People who are meant to be together are put in each other's paths as if they're drawn together. Maybe that's what's happening now. I know. It sure feels like there's forces pushing us together but it also feels like there's a lot of forces pulling us apart. Do you know why I left Seattle for Boise? Because you fell in love with Dad. Well, yeah. But not entirely. I love Seattle. The outdoors and my family, of course. But it was my past and your father was my future. Remember, he always used to say life is a big adventure? Well, it was. For a long, blessed time. Do you remember what we told you when you moved to Hawaii? Go where your heart leads you. Dad. Dad. Mom called. She's finished work one day early and she's coming. We don't have any presents for her or Grandma. Tell your brother to get his coat. Margie? Pat, what're you doing here? We're shopping for Mom and Grandma. Pat Godfrey? Carmen? Carmen manages this store. We've actually been working together since she graduated college. John, PJ, this is Carmen, one of my old friends. How many old friends do you have? By the looks of it, a lot. I'm not that old. - It's great seeing you, Pat. - You too. And nice to meet you boys. Happy holidays. So, who's up for a VIP shopping trip? I am. Yes. How about this one? Do you think your grandma would like it? I think she'll love it. It smells really good in here. I'll just sneak those into a side bag for you. How much? The boys do chores and volunteer as part of their allowance, and they do work around the neighbourhood for spending money, so... Thank you. So, more shopping or home to hide the presents? Actually, I promised a couple young men snowballs. More snowball fighting? Not that kind of snowball. Wanna come? Yeah. I don't remember the last time I had one of these. Or six of these. These are delicious! I know, right? Can we play that? Yeah. Yes! Nice shot! Come on, PJ. PJ! Hey, I need to go grab something real quick. Would you mind watching the boys for a couple seconds? Yeah, sure. They're gonna keep beating the pants off... That was so good! You got one. The first one because I'm taking after you guys now. Ok, here. PJ, you take this one. Hey. That's so good. Can I have that? Alright John, let's do this shot. Alright. - Dad. - Yes? We beat Margie two times already. These kids could teach a master class. Hey, could you take over for me? Yeah, yeah. Alright, I'm gonna need to see some power moves here 'cause you guys are champions! Two to win it. That's one! Could you bag that up for me? Yes! Margie's fun. Tonight was a good adventure, Dad. Yeah, it was. Yeah! Yeah!!! - Bye! Thanks again! - Bye Margie. Goodnight, bye. I'm not going anywhere. Hey, Pat. Case. Mom! Hey, hon. Oh hey, sleepy boy. You said you were coming in the morning. Yeah, I wound up driving straight through and when I called Grandma to tell her how close I was she said to come now. How about we take you upstairs to bed? Is that ok? Yes. Great. There. I brought new ornaments that we can hang tomorrow and a few things to tuck under the tree. We saved you some of Grandma's cookies. You guys are my heroes. Ok, have a good night. I love you guys. Love you too, Mom. Love you too, Mom. Fifteen minutes, guys. Lights out. Love you. Margie Southworth, huh? Crazy, right? Not at all. Tape. I remember being jealous of her when we first met. Is that true? Maybe we all have that one love we never get over. Well, we did a pretty good job, right? We worked hard to get here. And the boys are doing alright, spending summers with me and the rest of the year with you. You've done really great with them, you know. They're great kids. I got great gifts. I can't wait to see them. So fair warning I have spoiled the boys with presents. Well, if there ever was a year to spoil them it's this one. It's been a big one for them. So listen, I wanna tell you something. I met someone and I'd like to introduce him to the boys if that's ok with you. You're more than welcome to meet him first if you'd prefer. He's a good guy? He really is. We'll go slow and only take it serious if the boys are ok with him, but I think... I think he's the one. I'm happy for you, Case. You should talk to Margie. If I got a second chance at love you deserve one, too. Thank you. Have a good night. You too. Margie. Margie? Hi. I'm just here to drop off the kids' presents, and then I realized how early it was so I was gonna see if the key for the garage was in this hiding place and now that I said that out loud that's really weird. Take a ride with me. The boys will stay asleep and Mom's got them if not. It's still too early to go to a job. Pat. We need to talk. Us winding up face to face again and again, and your charms following me everywhere. There's gotta be a reason why this is happening. You don't happen to have hiking boots in your car, do you? For adventure? I actually always have a pair of hiking boots in my car now. Well, I'll get mine. Ok. It seems like forever ago we were up here. We were so young. Practically different people. Nice touch. Do you ever wonder what would have happened - if I had stayed? - If I went to Hawaii? What do you think? I don't know. I keep asking myself all these questions. Yeah, me too. Any answers? Nope. Pat, the way I grew up, it just-it wasn't until I met you and your family that I knew what it was like to... to be really loved. Then our lives took different paths. I just had to think that it wasn't my destiny. That you weren't my destiny. I just never expected you back. Sorry, I... You're still with someone. I'm sorry. No, I... I never expected to be back here. I guess this is just our thing, huh? You and me? Wrong place, wrong time. Let's head back down. Thanks so much for meeting me. Yeah. Of course. Thanks. I know it's been weird. No, it's me. I've been AWOL-ing... Before you start I wanna tell you something... Me too. Scott, I... I'm looking for another job. I didn't know why corporate brought me here, but I would never try to undermine you or try to take your job. Of course not. Scott, I... I know what this place means to you. I don't wanna disrupt that. No, you never... Scott... Wait, isn't that why you called me? Margie. Scott, it's been so, so wonderful having you in town, and getting the chance to spend more time together has been really... This is about us. Yeah. That's the conversation you wanted to have, isn't it? I just thought having you close would bring us closer. Yeah, me too. And it's not because of anything... you're not. Margie. Neither of us have ever pushed the whole time we've been together. Maybe that was because of distance but maybe it was just easier. We're both old enough to know that if we got this chance and it didn't change things, then we deserve something more. Someone who's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah. But Scott, please don't leave the company on my account. That's the last thing I want. I know, but if it means you get to keep doing what you love then I don't wanna stand in the way of that. Ok, well listen, I have a meeting with Willa later and I'm sure I'll have more information. Thank you. Yeah. Hey Kelly, do you know... Yeah, well my right wrist healed that fall and I started at spring baseball and then I broke the other one. And you still went into outdoor work? Yeah, the physical therapist got me climbing and I built my strength and I never looked back. The two of you, honestly. But it does sound like a great career path. Yeah, I love working for the park district. Well, I really should get going. Yeah, yeah, of course. It was great seeing you again. Thanks for having me. My mom is going to be so jealous. Well I've been talking about visiting Seattle for a while. I'll call her, I promise. You know, I think my mom misses Seattle more than she lets on. Especially right now. Well, it was really good of you to come by. Yeah, well a nice visit isn't the only reason why I came. I reached out to my contacts and one does have a job to offer. If you're actually interested in moving to Seattle. And we could have each store partner with a different local charity. We could do it for New Year's. Our New Year, New You campaign. It's what this company's always been about. Yes, something that you've understood since the day you started. These are fantastic ideas, Margie. Thanks. I know things have been kind of confusing lately. Yeah. Willa, I will do whatever it takes to show you that I belong here. Well, we want that, too. I promise you things are going to work out. You just have to trust me a little while longer. Of course. I got nothing out of Willa. She promised everything was gonna be ok. Well, we've been friends for so long, of course she's gonna say that. Or her hands are tied and you're being melodramatic. Look, it's three days 'til Christmas. Let's treat ourselves. I know exactly where we should go. Ok. I'll pick you up after work. Ok, bye. It's bananas to say that we're moving here and then to say that we're moving somewhere else, but it's not like we're settled in yet. It's still a vacation. It sounds like a great job to me, Dad. It is. Then we'll be closer to Mom and Grandma will have more good reasons to visit the place where she was born, but the most important thing is that you guys are ok with it. We go as a team or we don't go. So I want you to be totally honest with me. I'm ok with it. You said we'd like Boise and we do. If you think we'll like Seattle, we will. Wherever you are is our home. And when Grandma comes to visit it means she can show us the places she liked as a kid. I'll get Grandma and let's celebrate. I know just the place. Grab your coats. When are you telling Pat? Carm. When? You climbed a hill, you held hands, you broke up with your guy. The only thing left is just to... I didn't break up with Scott to be with Pat. No, you broke up with Scott because seeing Pat reminded you of what a real relationship should be. Margie. Did you plan this? What? No. I had no idea. Thanks, Dad! We'll see you in there! Did you plan this? Scouts honour, I had no idea. But you can't deny this anymore, Pat. It's a Godwink. Margie, look at me. How much more proof do you need that there is a bigger plan for the two of you? Carmen didn't even know we were here last night? The boys had such a good time last night. Carmen! Oh, my goodness. It's so great to see you. This is crazy. Pat just got a job offer so we decided to go and celebrate. You did? That's fantastic! Yeah, it's... it's in Seattle. I got a job offer in Seattle and I took it. So the boys and I are gonna move out there after the first of the year. Well, it sounds like a wonderful opportunity. It is. It is. For the boys, for their mom, for the kind of work I wanna do. Yeah. I'm really happy for you. Margie, what we had meant the world to me. But I know it's in the past. Do you remember your mom used to talk about Godwinks? She was talking about it the other day. And today. Maybe a job in Seattle closer to your ex... being where your mom grew up... maybe that's the Godwink. Wait, wait. It was in front of my mom's house. I've been finding you everywhere. I... I hope you build a really beautiful life for yourself and your boys in Seattle. Merry Christmas. Where are we gonna live in Seattle? I don't know. But I guess I'll learn what neighbourhood my job is in and we'll figure it out after that. Grandma should help. She knows all the best places to go. I don't know about that. I mean, it's been a while, but I'll try. Yeah, Grandma should come with us. To help us find a house? No, to live. I don't wanna leave her. Or her earmuffs, or her pancakes. I don't wanna leave her, either. I don't wanna leave her, either. Would you consider moving to Seattle? You wouldn't have to live in the same house as us, of course. We know we're loud. But Mom, having you in Seattle and making up for lost time, you'd be where you have history and friends and... and we could look out for each other and... Yes. Yes, it's a brilliant idea. I had a brilliant idea! Yes, you did! Yeah! Woo! Yeah! You wanted to see both of us? Yes. I know I have been quiet about a few things and I wanted to apologize for that. But I have some news. Margie, we did bring in Scott to train for your job. We are promoting him to VP of Marketing and Promotions for the northwest region. And Margie, there is a reason for that. Because we are offering you Senior VP of Marketing and Promotions for the entire company. You are already at the top of the list and that last meeting that we had where you brought forth all those amazing ideas? That only confirmed everything. You are both getting promotions. Now, we couldn't talk about this earlier because we were too busy negotiating this current SVP's exit package. I know it was awful being in the dark. I'm sorry, but I hope this makes up for it, yes? Yeah. Yeah. Ok, good. Ok. Wait, wait. Isn't SVP of Promotions and Marketing for the whole company... isn't that job at headquarters? Yes. It is. Now, we can move you up there or we can have you work remotely from here and you can go a few times, Margie... I need to go take my lunch break right away. But-but you are accepting the offer? Yes. 100 percent, yes. I just-I have to go tell someone something right now. Willa, thank you so much. And Scott, congratulations. This is amazing. Did you go on a job interview yesterday? Boise Home Outletters. Yes or no? You told me to. Well, I am un-telling you to. Because if anyone but me asks you to come work for them you say "I can't. I'm being promoted." Excuse me? I just got promoted to Head of Marketing and Promotions for all of Connor & Company. Margie! Which means that you just got promoted, too. What? Listen, you can stay in Boise and work from here or you can move to headquarters, but either way it's more responsibility. - It's a big raise. - That's amazing! But Kelly, all of it is up to you. And listen, I was wrong. If you get to work for one company that you love your whole career, it's a gift. But all of it is up to you. A new year and a new you. And me. Ok. Margie? I got something huge to tell you. Ok. It's... let me just grab my coat. Ok. I have really exciting news. I just got a huge promotion. That's great. No, that's not the exciting part. I'm really happy for you. The promotion is at corporate headquarters. Ok. In Seattle. Say that again. Pat, my company is moving me to Seattle. You're taking the job, right? Of course I'm taking the job. And I broke it off with Scott. But not because... Well, no, but... yeah. I mean, Pat, if a Godwink lands in your lap over and over and over again and you don't follow it... I mean, that's what this is, right? We're supposed to be together. I just don't see how we could spend one more day apart. Do you know what this will be? The greatest adventure in the world. Yeah. Thank you. What could it be? It smells like your cookies. Ooh, delicious. And yours is a candle that smells like Christmas trees. It's my favourite. Hey, do you guys wanna take the new sled in the snow? I'm going to get my camera. I'll take the back, PJ. Yeah. Ok guys... This is heavy. ...good to have a new sled. - Okay, mom. - Okay, mom. I got you something at the Christmas market the other night. What? I got you something that night, too. Do you think we did it? Let's open them together and see. Ok. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - A snowman. - A snowman. For all the fun we're gonna keep having. And all the adventure. Today the real life Margie and Pat Godfrey still live in the Seattle area. Their kids and grandchildren spread across America visit as often as possible. A family united, the Godfreys are grateful for the amazing Godwinks that mysteriously directed their paths and lifted their hopes. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
