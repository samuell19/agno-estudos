# Having fun # are you having fun? # we're having fun # hey, hey, let's go # having fun # are you having fun? # we're having fun So, how's it goin'? I think it's time to go. Go? The party's just starting to make it. Say, you know, you might as well be married. Now you got all the grief and none of the pleasure. Well, he's not complaining. Give him a chance and see what happens. Knock it off, Bobby. What, you wanna go, too? Did I say so? Come on, let's get some beer. Do you want some brew, shrew? Might warm you up, start you swinging a little. You don't really have to go yet, do you, Janet? It's up to Dan. Well, Bobby says we might as well stay. Stay? Well, by the time everybody goes, it'll be pretty late. Besides, we have to clean the place up. If Bobby's father ever saw it like this, he'd never give him the key again. Uh-uh. Please, Janet. Bobby said Dan wants to stay, too. Dan hasn't said anything to me about it. It's easy for you, Janet. You and Dan are steadies. You know how long I've been wanting Bobby to ask me out. I don't wanna spoil it on our first date. Please? You're out of your mind, Marge. What'll your mother say? I'll tell her I'm spending the night with you. And what do I do? The same thing. I mean, you tell your mother that you wanna spend the night with me. Dan never said anything about staying over here. Well, maybe not to you... Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck. Man, that Terry is way, way out there. Oh, you think so? Come on. I'll show you who's really out there. Go ahead and call, Marge. # wait for me # I'll be there for you # wait for me # I'll be waiting, too # though the days may go by oh-so-slowly # # wait for me # all my life # I will care for you # and through life # I will share with you # all my dreams # and soon our dreams will become a reality # # if you'll wait for me Dan! Dan, wake up! We've gotta get to school! Come on, will you?! Marge! Marge! Marge! Come on! Hurry up, will you?! Marge! We've gotta get to school! Come on! Take it easy, honey. Get down! Well, we're in shape. You jerk. What if they got the license number? You can get up now. Tsk. Boy, what a drag you are. They never got that close. - Did they? - Go ahead. Agree with him. Might as well. You wouldn't let me stop him when I could've. What good would it have done. We're minors, remember? First thing they would've done is call our parents, right? Right. Never should've stayed in the first place. "Never should have stayed in the first..." Well, what are you crying for now? Why make such a big deal out of this? I mean, they didn't catch us, so nothing happened. No. Nothing. How's my girl? You look... Later, later. The story is... "Once upon a time..." Hey, here comes the all-high! All right, all right. Can I finally be heard for a moment now? Take your seats, please. Take your seats. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. All right, let's see. Paul is out, and Doris. Hey, haven't you heard, Mr. Gifford? They're goin' steady. Thanks, George. I did hear George won a basketball game yesterday, so obviously he has no problems. Let's hear a little applause for George. Since the rest of us aren't quite so fortunate, will our hero please give us his attention, anyway? This morning, under "senior problems," we're scheduled to examine the subject of college entrance, what you hope to become. The people who planned this course think these are the things that most concern you. I'm taking up a collection. Well, I've been wondering. Alms. What about now? Practically everything on the list is about the future. What about your day-to-day concerns and feelings? Or let me put it this way: How can you decide for yourselves what you wanna become until you know who and what you are? Well, I've been wondering about a new list. Steven. What worries you the most right now? Me? Yes, you. Well, I got this theme I gotta hand in to my english teacher... And you haven't done it? No. Well, I imagine you and your english teacher will talk about that later, won't we, Steven? Uh, in the meantime... Study habits. Mark, what about you? Well, I've got this car. Yes, I've seen it. The transmission fell out, and it'll take 48 hours to fix it. Money, a day-to-day problem if I ever heard one. What are you gonna do about it? Well, I wanted to get a part-time job, but my dad said no. Did he say why? Yeah, he thinks I spend too much time in the car as it is. Authority of parents. - And what about you, Dan? - Hmm? Oh, the first list is okay with me. The only thing I'm worried about is getting in the college I choose. With your grades and activities, I think the chances are very good you will. But is that all that concerns you? Even if it wasn't, I don't see the sense in a bull session like this. What's it gonna prove? That's up to you. Could be just a bull session, or you could turn it into an important exchange of ideas. And it might force some of you to begin thinking for yourselves. Some of us already do. That's fine. Then you ought to have more to contribute. Okay, we'll register one vote for the original list. Janet, do you agree with Dan? No. I mean, well, the new list is more important if you're really honest about what goes on it. Well, you're making the list. What do you want on it? All right. Then I say the thing all of us are most concerned with is sex. Way to go, Janet. Yeah, way to go, jan. Yeah! That's what I'm thinking about. We've already discussed sex in health and hygiene. Tsk. I'm not talking about venereal disease or how babies are born. If what you mean are personal relations, Janet... I mean the day-to-day problems you're talking about, like how far a girl has to go with a boy just to be popular. What I started to say was that the things you mentioned are probably much better discussed with your own parents. Ha! Have you ever tried to talk about sex with my mother? Well, he knows what I mean. The parents aren't the only ones to blame. What about the boys who think they have to prove what big men they are? Well, since when is it just the boys? It still takes two, you know. Well, at least we're the ones that try to keep things in line. Oh, yeah? How about the time we were out you know, and you start this hand-grabbing thing... Hold it, hold it. This isn't getting us anyplace. Well, why not? You said you wanted us to be honest. I... do. Well, then let's get it out in the open, with boys and girls talking about it together just once. Yeah, what about it, Mr. Gifford? If it's really up to us, put it on the list. On the topof the list. The things you're asking for are very difficult to talk about, even for adults. But if it's that important... Sure is! How about it? All right. And now, here's the way we're gonna do it. Those of you who want to... And no one has to if he'd rather not... Take some paper and write out your questions or opinions. And, this is most important, no one signs his name. We'll spend the rest of the hour for it on monday during homeroom period. We'll select some of the papers and try to begin the discussion intelligently. Janet! I wanna know what you wrote. You'll hear it in class on monday. Tsk. I didn't force you to stay. That shows how little you know. Well, that's what you wrote about, isn't it? Yes. All about it. But how could you do such a thing? Don't you know what'll happen if Gifford tells? Oh, he wouldn't. He's a teacher, isn't he? He reads that paper, he'll feel it's his responsibility to tell the parents. Well, I thought at least we'd have a chance to talk about it. But you had no right to put it on paper. They're four of us in this, remember? You're not the only one. Well, it's too late now. No, it isn't. Ask him for it back and just say you changed your mind. He said himself no one had to write if they didn't want to. I can't ask him now. He'll be alone after classes. Okay? I never knew he was like that. Donna wrote that? You're kidding. No, I was looking over her shoulder. I saw the whole bit. Man, nothing like that ever happens in our class. Wait'll I tell Larry. I'll bet it's him she's talking about. Hey, maybe it's me. Oh, sure, it's you! Don't make me laugh. Okay, now, let's go, let's hit it! This whole thing's just a big, fat ball to you, huh? Well, sure, why not? When giff reads that jazz I made up, you'll crack up. And what's gonna happen when he reads one that isn't made up, like Janet's? Hey, you're kidding. She didn't write about last night? The whole bit. Is she out of her mind? Oh, relax. She's gonna ask him for it back. Well, she'd better. Yeah, some ball, huh? Are you waiting for me, Janet? Oh, yes. I wanted to talk to you, if I could. Of course. Anything wrong? Well, no. It's just that... Well... Could I have my paper back, please? The one I wrote this morning? You said yourself no one had to write one if they didn't want to, and, well, I changed my mind. One of the main reasons the class went ahead was because of the points you raised, Janet. I know. And I still think it's important. But, well, I guess I had no right to involve other... It's awfully complicated. Could I just have it, Mr. Gifford? I've already read the papers. All of them. Oh. It's all over the school... "The Gifford report," subtitled "a survey of a barely-human high school male and female." What are you talking about? The survey is yours, but the title is my own creation. What the wee beasties are calling it is something that could only be printed in limited editions. You're all crazy. We're crazy? Well, what... What does that make you? Don't stand there and tell me you didn't expect it. My friend, you not only have committed the original sin of discussing sex with the little ones, you departed from ordained curriculum to do it. That course outline is a joke. That's what yousay. That's what the kids say! And since when do what the kids say or do matter? Open your eyes, Pete. You mean close them, don't you? You're being paid to lead these kiddies down the garden path of reading, writing, and retirement these days, nothing more. Look, al, you're always talking about quitting teaching, so quit. You wanna spend the rest of your life stamping out identical parts, get a job in an automobile factory. You'll even make more money. But think of the status we math teachers have now that we've got to beat the russians. They're not your kids, Pete. While they're in this room, they are. But you're not their father. Look, if just a little fraction of what they say is true, you'd better drop these papers in the parents' laps, pronto. Oh... A word to the wise, Pete... I'm not kiddin'. I'll just die if my mother finds out. Oh, nobody ever died from it. Get off the panic button, will ya? Janet can just say she made the whole thing up. It's what I did. You want me to lie, too? You got a better idea? Anything happens, all anyone has to know is we had a party, that's all. First thing tomorrow, we'll go out to the beach house and pick up all the beer bottles and stuff. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. We'll meet at my place, okay? I don't feel good. I don't think I'll be able to go. You don't have to go. Janet? Okay. Morning, mother. Morning, dear. Well, is that all you're wearing? I'm going to the beach, mother. Can't go out like that. Put a skirt on. But mother! Don't let's discuss it. Hello? Well, yes... well, she's kind of busy right now. All right. Mother, it's Mrs. Hunter. Set your father's place for breakfast, please. Hello, Mrs. Hunter. How are you? Uh... what? Well... now, what did you say? Oh. No, I... I hadn't heard anything about it. Where did it happen? I'm going now. W-Wait, Janet. Yes, I certainly do intend to find out. I'll call you back. Janet, how could you not have told me about this? About what? You know perfectly well what I'm talking about. Why, that lady on the phone was almost hysterical, and I don't blame her. It's disgusting. Well, I don't know what Mrs. Hunter said, but whatever it is, nothing happened, really... But do you call a teacher having young children fill out a sex questionnaire "nothing"? Oh, mother, it wasn't like that at all. We were discussing senior problems, and Mr. Gifford said that... Introducing such things into a classroom! Well, let me tell you something, young lady. Not only as a parent but as president of the p.T.A., this time your Mr. Gifford's gone too far. Sex survey, indeed. Why don't you listen just once, mother? We had some questions, and we wrote them out so we could discuss them on monday. What kind of questions? Everybody had different ones. They were personal. Oh, I see. You can hardly utter ten civil words to your parents, but you can discuss your personal problems with Mr. Gifford. Mother, please... Janet, I want to know what you wrote. All right. I asked if it was wrong for a girl to prove to a boy exactly how much she loves him. What do you mean "prove"? Well, if you don't know, mother, maybe you'd better ask dad. Morning, Janet. Well, what's the beef this morning? Hey, where's breakfast? I tee off in less than a hour! George... I'm afraid something's happened at school that you ought to know about. Uh-uh, Katie. No p.T.A. Now. I'm playing with two customers. I can't afford to be late. George, this happens to concern your daughter. I'm afraid she's gotten herself into... Serious trouble. Well, howdy there, folks. Big Bobby, once again. Say, I want you to know something. You know those high-pressure stunts they're pulling? Well, that's... that's for the competition. Now, just as sure as I am standing down here at Big Bobby's motor city, we are just plain folks. Now, I mean that. Why don't you get all your brood together... I mean all of 'em now... And you come on down and see us. And whatever you're driving... I don't care what it is... I really don't. I don't care whether it's a car, a cycle, a snowplow, or... Pogo stick. You come on down and we're gonna take it, whatever its shape is, as the down payment. And then you and me, we're gonna sit on down, and we're gonna figure out a deal that will suit you. And if it so happens it suits us in passing, why, well, that's just, uh, trimming on the Turkey, so to speak. Seriously, though, folks, I want you to know one thing, now. Once you and Big Bobby have made a deal and we have shaken hands on it, you are guaranteed satisfaction... Or your money back. Now, I want you to... I want you to meet ol' clem. He's been with me a great number of years. He's my assistant. You all know him. He has got some real beauties he wants to show to ya. ...And that we're probably having regular orgies. Well, well, well... Seems as if I've been missing something listening to myself. Uh, someone wanna fill me in? Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Herman. Ah, secrets, huh? No, there's nothing secret about it, dad. Janet was just, uh, telling us how some of the parents have been calling each other. Well... Nobody called me. What's it all about? Well, it's this thing at school. We've been kicking it around in giff's class, and now some of the characters are all upset. It's... it's nothing. What thing have you been kicking around? Well, sex. A discussion, you know. Oh, oh. We gotta split if we're ever gonna get down to the beach. I'll see ya, dad. Wait a minute. You need any money? No, I got enough. Thanks, dad. Okay. You got a large mouth. Oh, relax. He's on our side. When they call him and see how little he cares, this whole thing'll probably curl up and die. I just wish we could be sure Gifford won't spill it. Oh, listen, giff will never tell. "As sure as I'm sitting here at motor city," our troubles are over. Oh, hello, Mrs. Sommers? It's Bobby Herman. Oh, no, no. This is Big Bobby. I'm, uh... I'm calling about that... That matter at school. Well, little Bobby, he... He always tells me everything. Well, naturally, you know, having been both father and mother to the boy all these years, we're, uh, very close. Yes, it is serious. Now, look if... if it's a man of action you want, I'm... I'm it. I'll be glad to do it as my duty as a parent. Your house? You bet, Mrs. Sommers. I... I certainly will. Not at all. Thank you. I'm gonna... I'm gonna put all this stuff in old lady berman's garbage pail. Liven up her garbage for the neighbors... ha! Well, I guess that's it. You look pretty cute in that outfit. Don't. Okay, let's just clean it and clear out. Look, I know we goofed, but we're still the same people, aren't we? Only now you look at me like I'm some kind of a filthy animal. Oh, stop it, Dan. That's not true. Then why? Because I'm scared. Of me? Of both of us. Of letting you touch me. 'Cause then... I want you to kiss me. And when you kiss me, I... We love each other, don't we? What are we gonna do, Dan? We're gonna get married. When you're through with college. That's four years away. What do we do meanwhile? Let's go for a swim! If this place gets any cleaner, my ol' man's really gonna wonder what happened down here. Well, it's awful cold. Cold? Man, that's cool. Real cool. Come on. Last one in's a juvenile delinquent. Whoo-hoo! Now, there's no reason to be frightened, dear. All we're trying to find out is what Mr. Gifford made you write. I told you. Some of us didn't write anything. And Dan Carlyle, he even tried to stop it. Yes, and Mr. Gifford wouldn't let him, is that it? Well, they argued. Uh, did Bobby argue, too? No, he just... he just thought up something and wrote it down. Mother, please, let's go. I don't feel well. Oh, she's so upset. You're going straight to bed as soon as we get home. I heard her until 3:00 this morning still tossing... Well, I know you're both tired... And the night before must've been just as bad for you. Mother, let's go. Oh, I know you. You and Janet probably kept everyone here up until all hours. Mrs. Ryker... Didn't Janet spend the night before last at your house? - At myhouse? - No, the girls were here. Oh, no, they were not here. But Marge phoned and said... Yes. And Janet phoned and said she was staying with Marge. Uh, now, wait a minute. Are you saying that... Be quiet, George. Marge, where were you? Why does everything have to happen when your father is out of town?! Mrs. Ryker, she will have to tell us where they went and with whom. We went to a party at the beach house with Bobby and Dan. At the beach? You mean my place? And you stayed there... Together all night? Nothing would've happened if Janet hadn't started writing about it. Where is she? I think they're back at the beach house. What? Well, I want them out of there right now, do you hear me?! What's the telephone number at that place? All right, all right. Let's stay calm. You stay calm! You don't have a daughter! All right, I'll phone 'em! But let's not be so quick to blame the kids. Well, my dear, Mr. Herman's right. Whatever's happened, it's due to the influence of that dreadful Mr. Gifford. You bet your life. We raised fine kids. It's just that they hear these things in school and their teachers encourage them. Now he wants to have a discussion and spread it all over town. Look, right now all I want is Janet out of that beach house and home. Come on, the telephone's right over here. All right! All right. Hey! Hey, not so hard. That's better. Say, maybe you guys can live on love, but I can't. I'm starved. Let's run down to the pier and get something to eat. Oh, I don't feel like going out. Pick up some burger stuff and we'll cook here. It's on. Hello? Yeah, hi, dad. Yeah, she is... okay, you don't have to yell. Just a minute. She's right here. Hey, Janet, your dad wants to speak to you. Hello, dad. What's the matter? Well, of course I can hear you, dad. Can't I know why? But I don't understand. All right. What's up? We have to go home right away. That's all he'd say. I never heard my ol' man yell like that before. I'll... I'll bet they found out about last night. What are we gonna do, Dan? It's Gifford. I knew he'd tell. You might know they'd wind up discussing sex. What else is on their mind? Then it was the right thing for them to talk about. Most important, they chose the subject. Students are not necessarily the wisest choosers of what's best for them. Well, we adults haven't always done so well ourselves. They'll be here any minute. Where do you stand on this, Mr. Morton? It isn't that simple. A principal today has to be a public relations expert, a politician, a mediator, and only incidentally an educator. I'm telling you this so you'll understand my answer. For the moment, I stand with you. But at the same time, I strongly recommend you tell the parents you made a mistake. Assure them there'll be no such discussion in your class and apologize. Apologize? If the idea is offensive to you, I'll apologize for you. That's part of my job, too. And if I refuse, then where do you stand? I'll ask you this... Do you want to continue teaching here? Well, come in. Please, come in! This is Mr. Gifford, whom some of you already know. How do you do? And shall we all sit down? I believe Mrs. Ryker was to be here, too. Uh, no, she will not be here. Marge has been so upset by this entire thing that she's had to be put to bed. Well, I'm sorry. Now... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh... you go ahead, Mr. Herman. Thank you. Well, uh, first of all, we wanna know whether or not the school's job is teaching, instead of, uh, trying to act like some psychiatrist. I mean, filling the kids' heads with all kinds of... Furthermore, I don't even know if I like their being here now. My daughter's waiting outside, and she's gonna stay there. Well, I asked your children to be brought here because it seems we've missed one very important fact. I'd like you to tell us. Did Mr. Gifford initiate the discussion or was it the students? What difference does it make? When I went to school, the teacher decided what went, not a bunch of kids still wet behind the ears. And everybody knows schools were a lot better off then. Yes, Mr. Sommers. Well, the point is, Mr. Morton, that the p.T.A. Has covered this entire subject, and that the school board decided that... Sex education was the responsibility of each parent as the case may be. Now, why Mr. Gifford chooses to ignore this and start a sex survey... Who told you it was a sex survey, Mrs. Sommers? Well, by now I should think everybody in town knows it. How could that be when the only ones who know the contents of those papers are the students who wrote them and myself? Did Janet tell you about her paper? No. Marge Ryker told her mother. But Marge was one who didn't choose to write a paper. I am not on trial here, Mr. Gifford. No one is on trial here, Mrs. Sommers. Please, please, let's... Try to remain calm. I agree with you, Mr. Carlyle. This is not getting us anyplace. Now, if we're through with the children, can they be dismissed? Of course. All right. Now, then, let's get down to brass tacks. Well, how about that? Sick, man. Sick. I was wrong. Gifford didn't tell. It was Marge. Hey, you ought to see your ol' man. He's coming on like some kind of madman in there. Where are you going? Without indulging further in personalities, I think we all agree that... That what happened was ill-advised. Mr. Gifford is as sorry as I am. I haven't heard him say so. You're entitled to exactly the kind of schools you want. As Mr. Herman points out, you're the tax payers... I'm only the hired help. Well, that's good enough for me. Well, I'd like to say that the pta... Well, it's not good enough for me! Well... Mr. Sommers, if, uh, what we're interested in is avoiding trouble... We've already got trouble! And it's his fault. Oh, I've heard all about this guy from my wife. I don't want him teaching my daughter! I don't know what you're suggesting, Mr. Sommers. It's simple. In my business, a man has a job, he does it, or you get rid of him. If anyone's been hurt as a result of what's happened in my class... I apologize. Sure you do now, but what about next time? There won't be any next time. Well, what more do we want? All right. Tell him to hand over the papers. No. I'm sorry. I couldn't let anyone see those papers. I promised the students when they wrote them. What do you mean you "promised the students"? If I may make a suggestion... Are the papers in the building? No, they're at home. Well, in that case, Mr. Gifford can bring them to me first thing monday morning, at which time I will see to it personally that they are destroyed. That suits me. You see how easily these things are settled? Any time you have any problems to discuss about your children, please come in... Where's Janet? Oh, she and Dan went out to the car... I think. Oh, she did, did she? We'll talk to them. We'll explain. It'll be all right. They won't listen. We'll make them listen. We'll tell 'em we wanna be engaged. They'll never let us now. Oh, Dan! Take your hands off her, you young punk! Get out of that car! Get out! Now, wait a minute, Mr. Sommers. Get out. Now get in the car. There's something I've got to say. Now, you do as you're told. Sorry I pushed you, Sommers. This isn't the end of this. There are laws. This girl is underage. Stop it, dad! I'll get the full story from her! Charges can be brought against that boy of yours! I won't tell you anything. You can believe whatever you want! You'll do what you're told, hear? Get in the car, Kate. All right, you're grounded. Give me the keys. Oh, come on. Come on, come on, come on, give. These wheels go back on the lot today. Hello? Yes, jan. What's the matter? Why are you crying? Janet? Janet? Listen, Mr. Sommers, I wanna talk to Janet! Will you put her back on the phone?! Hello? Hello?! Where are you running to? I've got to go over there. You're not gonna leave this house. I've got to go! Now, you listen to me. I could've cut this hand off when I hit you this afternoon. But I'll hit you again if that's what it takes to get some sense into you. You heard Sommers in that parking lot today. Do you want him to bring the police into this? Oh, for what?! You don't know what you're talking about! I know that I'm not going to let you ruin yourself. Now... you go to your room and stay there. Oh, dad, if you heard the way she was crying... And whose fault is that?! Yes, yours! She's with her parents now. There's nothing you can do about it. You okay? I wanted to come over last night after your call, but I couldn't even get out of the house. Was it rough? They had the doctor come out. What? I didn't even let him get close. Hey, Bobby, what happened? The parents have really been blowin' their tops, huh? Mine have been yakkin' at me all weekend. Did the principal really try to expel you? No, not that I know of... Why'd they call you in, Dan? You didn't even write a paper. What did Mr. Gifford say? He stuck up for you, didn't he? Forget about Gifford. What do you mean? Well, Gifford's too busy apologizing for himself to worry about anybody else. I don't believe it. Well, don't believe it. I was there. Look, if you wanna know what really happened... Oh! Mr. Gifford, Mr. Morton was down to see if you came in yet. Well, I'm on my way to his office. The all-high is here. I'm going to ask you all to find something you can do quietly for the next few minutes. What about the papers, Mr. Gifford? Yeah! What about them? Whatever else you heard about this weekend, there are a couple of decisions you ought to know. The first one is that these papers are to go to Mr. Morton to be destroyed, which is what I'm about to do now. Aw, geez! Who decided that, Mr. Gifford? - Nobody asked us! - Yeah, that's right! They're our papers! Don't we have any rights about what happens to 'em? And the second decision is that there will be no further discussion on this subject in this class. Only this subject, Mr. Gifford? Okay, so we can't discuss sex. Now, suppose someone wants to discuss military service. Like, should he volunteer before going to college or wait and go afterward? Or better still, major in something to get a deferment altogether? That's part of college entrance, isn't it, Mr. Gifford? Only how sure will we have to be that we're not stepping on somebody's toes if we wanna talk about it? Whose permission do we need, Mr. Gifford?! Our parents? The veterans? Mr. Morton's? I realize some of you have been hurt by all this, and believe me, I'm sorry if what's happened in this class is to blame. But... don't take your personal grudges out on us here. You haven't answered the question, Mr. Gifford. What if we wanna discuss the h-bomb? Yeah! It gets dropped and we die just like everybody else. Whose permission before we talk about that? What about religion or politics? That's not fair! He has his job to do! Just a minute, Terry. I've got my job to do, but what is it? You ask what your rights are? The answer is whatever you fight to make them as young people, and as adults... And my job should be to help you. All term long, I've needled you to ask questions, to think for yourselves. It would be pretty rotten of me to shut you up now just because you haven't picked the questions I would have liked you to ask. So you know what we're gonna do? If you're sure you want to, we'll read the papers and begin the discussion as planned. Here's one as good as any to begin with. It says, uh... Mr. Gifford. Mr. Gifford, would you dismiss your class now? They can spend the rest of this period in study hall. This is not just a request, Mr. Gifford! Class dismissed. Why in front of them? How can I face them now? You made a promise in front of those parents. But it's the kids that matter to me. I want to go on working with them. What else can I do? I want those papers and you in my office right now. What are you, crazy? What happened here? Who did that? How are we supposed to know? Don't use that tone with me. Somebody here saw it. Nobody, eh? Get somebody from the kitchen to clean it up. Me? Yes, you. And now. Well, that was a brilliant stunt. Who cares. Oh, what are you trying to prove? I just don't dig gettin' pushed around, that's all. So you break dishes. That's real cool. You got any better ideas? I think Mr. Gifford is suspended. What? Oh, no. He was in Mr. Morton's office for a long time, and then he just left the building. Wow. Well, we've gotta dosomething! We? What could we do? But it's our fault, isn't it? If we hadn't made him go ahead with those papers, he wouldn't have lost his job. That wasn't our fault. It was our sweet parents that did it. Look, I don't think my old man meant for Mr. Gifford to lose his job. I mean, he's just not that kind of a guy. I'll bet he doesn't even know. And if he did know? I think he might do something. So tell him. Okay, I'll call him right now. Yeah, well, I'll call him there, then. Thank you. He wasn't at the lot. They said he wasn't feeling well, so he went home. Call him there. Got a dime? We still have 40 minutes of lunch hour left. Why don't we see how he's feeling, and if he's all right, you tell him. Fine. I'm out of car. You still in business? Yeah. Let's use George's. Fine, let's go. Who's there? It's me, dad. Excuse me. What the hell are you kids doing out of school? Well, I called the lot and they said you weren't feeling well. Well, I'm... All right. I didn't know anyone was here. Well, she just stopped by to... to see how I was. Uh, miss Martinson... We gotta talk to you, dad, it's important. All right, all right. Let's talk. Well? What is it? Well, Mr. Gifford was suspended from his job today. Oh? Well, that's too bad. I told the guys you didn't have anything to do with it. How could I? It was a school matter. We think it stinks, Mr. Herman. We sure do. I want you all to know that I don't feel any better about it than you do. I told them you'd be real sore. Listen, dad, I'll bet you could straighten it out with just a couple of phone calls. Will you? Please, Mr. Herman. Wait a minute. The school suspended him. Why should I stick my neck in? You helped start it, Mr. Herman, along with Janet's parents and mine. I helped start it? He was the one that got you to... I just want you all to know something. He was lucky to get off with just a suspension. Did you want him to get fired? Come on, Bobby. You know better than that. I didn't have anything against this guy personally. Then why won't you help? Now, listen! All of you listen. I'll level with you. I'll level with you in a way that your parents wouldn't. I've got a used car lot, and the guy across the street from me has a used car lot. He has just as many good used cars on his lot as I have on mine, yet I sell more cars. Why? Because I'm better liked, that's why. Better liked. What's gonna happen to me if I go to bat for Gifford in this sex business... And with kids! Look, it's a cruel, realistic world. It's a closed book. It's better for everybody that way. Better for Gifford, too, huh? Leave him alone. Can't you see he's scared? Now, listen! Come on, Bobby. Come on, huh? I'm sorry... I said I'm sorry! Look, the keys are still in your car. Go ahead and take it. Let bygones be bygones. No thanks. The teacher's gonna see you in a minute. Big deal. Sure. How about giving me a hand with the press? Why don't you just leave me alone? Okay, unless you'd like some more dishes to break. Never mind looking for that space down there. I already found it. Bobby and I are getting ready to pull proofs. Which job is that? The dance announcement. Well, get going. This period's just about over. Roger! Over and under. Barf. Oh, come here, you jerk. Wait till you see this. I couldn't care if it had wings. "Giant student protest rally"? Yeah! And we do it ourselves without any help from anyone. Man, that's too much. Hey, George. Come on over here. Shut up! You want to ruin this before we get started? Look, your job is to put this someplace where the teacher can't find it. Oh, leave it to me. Well, hi. Is this a delegation? The whole class would have come if we let them. Well, come on. Sit down. Can I get you anything? Fellas? We heard what happened, and well... Maybe you better read this first. "Giant student protest rally." Say, that's really something. How'd you do it, when, where? Dan did it in print shop, right under the teacher's nose. Crazy. What are you gonna protest, or better still, what are you gonna demand? That nobody goes back to school until you do. It won't work. We'll make it work! You'd better hear what I wrote this afternoon. It's addressed to Mr. Morton. "Dear sir, I hereby request an immediate transfer. "After carefully considering the circumstances, "I've come to the conclusion I can better serve education elsewhere." They made you do that, I bet. It's known as a mutual decision, Janet. And you went along with them. I went along with nobody! I did what I felt was right. Now it's over, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to hear any more about it. When you're older, you'll understand. Let's cut out, Dan. No. This protest is for us, too. You can walk away, Mr. Gifford, but we can't. If you pull out of this now, we haven't got a chance. You haven't got one anyway. At least we can fight for one. Against the school, the authorities? Your parents? You'll lose. Then give us a couple of days to lose in. All you have to do is not hand in that letter yet. Say, we're wasting our time. He comes on a little different, but he's just like all the rest. "Do what I say, not what I do." How about it. Will you wait? Mail it whenever you want. Thanks. Roll the presses! Yahoo! Hi. Hi, dad. Could I see one of those? Sure. You did this by yourself? I had help. Let's talk about it. Sit down. Dan, I guess you've heard me gripe plenty of times about how I had to give up studying architecture and go to work. Well, the truth is, I'm okay as a contractor, but I wouldn't have been much good as an architect. You, you're different. In many ways, you're a lot smarter than I ever was. You'll make a very good architect. You're headed for the best schools, you've gotten me to back you up in whatever you want... Why ruin all that? Nothing is gonna be ruined. In fact, we're gonna fix a couple of things. Dan, I've always let you make your own decisions, and I've backed you up. I'd like to back you up in this, but I just don't understand why you keep butting your head against a stone wall. Look what you're getting into. They'll label you as a troublemaker, put it on your record. You force them, they might even expel you. And for what? Look, sure I want to be an architect, but when I am, I've got to have enough confidence in myself to draw plans the way I see them. And as for being labeled, well, if that's what happens when you have enough guts to fight for what you believe in, well, I'll just have to take my chances. You're gonna lose. What can kids like you accomplish by yourselves? I guess you don't understand what I'm saying, dad. We've got to try. No, listen, I'll go to the principal and talk to him for you. It's too late for that now, dad. It's out of your hands. Good night. Let's have one big fight! Fight! Let's have two big fights! Fight, fight! Let's have three big fights! Fight, fight, fight! Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar. All for Mason high stand up and holler. Yeah! # are we satisfied? # satisfied # are we satisfied? # satisfied # real satisfied # real satisfied # let's make a hustle and we're on the top # # let's make a hustle and we're on the top # # let's make a hustle and we're on top # # let's make a hustle and we're on top # # hi di hi di ho ho # hi di hi di ho ho # hi di hi di ho ho # hi di hi di ho ho # hey, hey, let's go # hey, hey, let's go In our own print shop, on our own press! I can't understand how you let that happen. Like I've been telling you, we're understaffed. Oh, come on. I can't check everything. It's a nice little job. Course, the spacing here could be a little wider, but on the whole, it's not so... You can go. Okay, can I have your attention, everybody, for just a minute? Let's close it in, here. That's fine. What a group. Now we all know why we're out here, and so far everything's been great, but that's just step number one. Now, the last bell is gonna ring in a minute, so here's the pitch: Nobody goes into that school until Gifford does, and let's vote on it. All those who agree... Hey, look, I mean, Mr. Gifford's an all right guy, but we're the ones that are gonna get in trouble. There will be no trouble if we stick together. Gifford doesn't have to be out here. He can get himself a lawyer or something. In the meantime, they'll come down on us like a ton of bricks. What are you talking about? What can they do to us? What can they do to us? They can expel us! Can they expel the whole school? No, no. That's what they're gonna have to do if we stick together. All right, all right. Now let's vote on it. All those in favor of staying out, come on, let's hear it! Anybody disagree? It's unanimous. We stay out. Any sign of him yet? It's almost an hour since you called. Call again to check if he's left. Wait a minute. I believe our conquering hero has just arrived. Make way for him. Hold it, everybody. We haven't won yet. Mr. Gifford has just been called in for a conference, but if we hold on, we will win. Come in. Well, there you see the results of your creative teaching methods. How do you like it? I had nothing to do with it. Nothing! You're responsible. You started it. You're going down there and tell them to get back into school. They wouldn't listen to me. We want Gifford! Louder! We want Gifford! We want Gifford! We want Gifford! They'll listen, all right. You're underestimating them, just as I did. Look, Gifford, I don't want any of your philosophizing. I've bent over backwards trying to avoid trouble, but that can't go on. If you ever want to teach anyplace again, you'll go down there and call them in. You think that would make any difference? Don't you realize what's happening down there? All the world these past years, students have been out in the streets fighting for things. Maybe a lot of them have been wrong. But they spoke out. Here, we've had nothing but silence. Well, now the silence is broken. This might sound corny, but that's our future down there showing enough guts to stand up for what they believe in. Then you won't bring them in? I wouldn't... If I could. Get me the chief of police. No. You can't do that. I have no other choice. Loring, this is Morton again. I will need your men after all. What happened? The police are coming. So let them come! Don't you see? It's no longer between you and the school anymore. That's not our fault. We didn't call them. But it had to happen. I tried to warn you. You don't win this easily. What do you want us to do, give up and go back inside? I just don't want you to get hurt badly. Shut off that music. Now, I want to say this, and I'm going to say it just once. I want this street cleared immediately. You're unlawfully blocking traffic, you're using sound equipment without a permit, and you're disturbing the peace. All right! I'll give you 60 seconds to get off this street and back into that school. If you're not inside in one minute, I'm gonna use that fire hose. Just try it. Go ahead and try it. Wait a minute. We've got our rights. I wanna ask you how come... You'll ask me nothing. From now on, you're gonna be seen and not heard. I'll give you one minute. All right, everybody, back inside. Hey, what are you... are you gonna do what he tells you? Exactly what he tells us. Now, listen. Thirty seconds. Hook up those fire hoses. Go on and pass the word. Let's go back inside, everybody. Back inside. Good morning. I'll be substituting for your regular teacher the next few days. My name is Mr. Meadows. Today's period will be short in view of the circumstances, not much more time than taking the roll and getting a little acquainted. Since I don't know your names... yet... You'll have to help me out. Who sits there? Doesn't anyone sit there regularly? I, uh, don't understand. What are you trying to do? Young lady in the second row, would you stand up, please? Now, does anyone sit in that seat in front of you? All right, what's your name! Marge Ryker. All right, play your games, but without me. Shh. I want to see if they'll keep it up while I'm gone. Have you ever seen anything as silly as this? I thought they were just doing it to me. They can't keep it up. They're still angry. In an hour, it'll all disappear. Isn't chemistry hard enough without this foolishness? Well. Can't very well go ahead with the experiment until you know the formula. All right, get started. I'm warning you, Charles, for the last time. Unless you answer, I have no alternative but to Mark you with a failing grade. And the same thing goes for whomever I call on next. Pie, cake, or pudding? How am I supposed to know what you're pointing at? If you can't say, you can just go without dessert. Wait a minute. Here you are. You can pick it up for yourself. May I have your attention, please? This is Mr. Morton speaking. It has been an unusual and trying day for all of us. As far as the events of this morning are concerned, I'm willing to put them behind us, but I must warn you of serious consequences if you persist in your present behavior. The term's work cannot be completed under such circumstances. That goes for all grades, but especially for the senior class. I ask you to consider this: Is what you are doing worthwhile if it means you will not be able to graduate? And you will have only yourselves to blame. Some of you feel you have grievances. I want to be fair. I will be alone in my office for the next hour. If you feel you have a justifiable complaint, come up and we'll talk about it. This will be your last chance. Fred, come in here. No one came, huh? Nope. Well, they've had their chance. Now the gloves come off. Fred, I'm turning this thing over to you. Me? Why not? It's a discipline problem we're facing here, pure and simple. You're the Dean of boys; discipline is your department. The first thing I want you to do is cancel all privileges immediately. Okay. You don't approve? Maybe you've got a better idea. I haven't the slightest idea, but I'd better call Jefferson right away. What for? We have a basketball game with Jefferson this afternoon and you want it cancelled, don't you? I most certainly do. Okay. No, wait a minute. Basketball game. Fred, that's it! I don't get it. Well, don't you see? How can they keep from yelling their heads off at a basketball game? No, we're not gonna cancel that game. It's going on as scheduled. You're up unless you're down, you're down unless you're up. You're upside down. We want a basket, go, go. We want a basket, go, go. We want a basket, go, go. Attention, attention, Dan Carlyle, report to the principal's office immediately. How long to you intend to keep this up? We're ready to be seen and not heard until we're allowed to speak freely. Come now, you can be more specific. You want to continue the discussion on those papers. Yes, sir, and any other discussions like it that come up. We want to hear any group, any side, on any subject so that we can make up our minds for ourselves. We've written it out. It's taken from the first amendment of the bill of rights. Yes, I can see that. "And the school shall not abridge the freedom of speech of student or teacher." You wouldn't care to include the word "principal" there, would you? Believe it or not, Dan, I'm as much in favor of academic freedom as you are. Then you agree? There's room here for only two signatures. Well, I can sign for the students. And I'd be happy to sign for the school, but that would still leave one missing. You must realize this would be useless without the agreement of the parents. It is, it's disgraceful. The next step is juvenile delinquency. But what can you do when the school can't, or worse still, won't, handle its discipline problems? Mother, I have to talk to you. I couldn't agree with you more... the p.T.A. Must act, and an emergency board meeting is definitely in order. Please, mother, this is very important. Oh, I'm sorry, I'll have to call you back. Now, you listen to me, young lady. No, mother. You're going to listen to me this time. Please. This is the paper I wrote in Mr. Gifford's class. I want to read it to you. "My boyfriend and I "have been going steady over a year. "We've decided to wait to get married, "because we want to be sensible. "But it's not so easy. "We're not little children anymore, "and sometimes kissing is not enough. "At a recent party, we decided to stay all night, "but the way things turned out, "we were so scared and guilty "we just couldn't go through with it. "The feeling we have for each other is wonderful, "but sneaking away from our parents "so we can be together makes it dirty. "I love my mother, "and I respect her... "But I cannot talk to her about these things. "Every time I start to, "she makes remarks about what kids we are "and that I don't know what love is. "But I do love my boyfriend... "And I don't want to lose him. "That's what scares me, "because the next time "we might not be able to stop. "What'll happen if the next time "we do give into each other? "If I have to lie to my parents "instead of being able to come to them, "where else can I get help but here? "I'm sure that other girls and boys "have the same problem. "Maybe if we all talked about it, we could get the answer." Break quiet. Here's the agreement signed by the principal and the head of the p.T.A. Yahoo! I had to face you to say good-bye and to congratulate you. You should be very proud of the stand you made and the courage you showed. The next place I teach, I'll have your example to prove what can be done when you fight for what you believe in. We didn't mail it at all, Mr. Gifford. We've all learned so much these last few days. Being able to change things is a big responsibility, and all of us would feel a lot better if you were here to keep us from making too many mistakes. I, uh... Think this was the paper I was about to read before we were interrupted. "The biggest problem... And I'm sure it's true..."
