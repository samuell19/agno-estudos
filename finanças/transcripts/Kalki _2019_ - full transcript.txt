After the independence of India... Those were the days when the independent kingdoms were incorporated into Indian union. The Nizam of Hyderabad opposed this proposal... He sent forth the Razakars to destroy the Hindu provinces, temples and wealth to protect his kingdom. It was under the Nizam’s rule. Kollapur was a province nestling in the deepest of the Nallamala forest by the banks of River Krishna. Raja Balakishan Rao was the king of the province. Rajaratnam was his minister and confidante... while Narsappa was a jackal eyeing the throne. That day the king was in the temple of Lord Narasimha. Offered a diety to the Lord with sandal paste available only in Nagulakona. The Razakars attacked the temple at the opportune time with the help of Narsapppa. While they were demolishing the temple… He went to stop them… The king lost his life fighting them. With the entry of the police, the Nizam surrendered. The country was facing the elections for the first time. Cunning Narsappa contested as MLA of Kollapur. Rajaratnam was aware of Narsappa’s evil ways, He convinced Ramachandramma and made her contest against Narsappa. In spite of all the political games played by Narsappa, we had elected Ramachndramma as our MLA. She treated the people equal to her son. ‘She built schools and hospitals… She was an exemplary leader. Revengeful Narsappa... Found a pawn in Rajaratnam’s wayward son, Perumandlu. Taking him under his influence, Narsappa emptied the treasury with the help of Perumandlu and set fire to the royal palace, Rajamahal. Our hopes and desires turned to ashes along with Rajaratnam and Ramachandramma. Using Perumandlu and violence as weapons, Narsappa has become an autocratic leader of Kollapur. We don’t own our lands. We don’t have rights on our food. We have no rights over our women. Perumandlu was hand in glove with Narsappa for 30 years. But because of political differences he filed his nomination against Narsappa. Together they had sent quite many to the grave. Now that they are separated, they are turning this town into a grave yard. This is our village story. Is there no one to question this injustice? There is one guy, Narsappa’s brother Sekharbabu. He finished his studies in city recently and returned. He's our only hope for peace in future. The 'Draupadi Vastrabaranam' drama by Shri Sarada Vijaya Natyamandali will begin shortly.. The third part of drama is about to begin. It’s about to start… Let’s go or we won’t find place in the front row. It’s the same old Draupadi and the same old disrobement. Sit down. This topic is good, tell me more about it. - I'm leaving. - Hey. Hello... Grandpa! Please complete the story. Grandpa! I will end your dignity. You should be stripped. The legendary defeaters of the epic. I'm a woman and an orphan. When the righteousness ends... People simply watch and say nothing... Grandpa… Krishna saved Draupadi. It would've been good if he had finished Kauravas. There won't be 'Kurukskhetra' if he did so. Krishna's policy is to stand by righteous but not slaying. Krishna... He was right here. Where did he disappear? Greetings. Ramulu! The toddy shop is burnt, right? Why are you getting worried? It wasn't just the toddy shop. Sekhar babu. Sekhar babu… Narsappa’s younger brother Sekhar babu? Reports confirm that Sekhar babu is dead. 'Akashvani, Hyderabad' Welcome to the evening news... Kollapur MLA Narsappa's brother Sekhar Babu was brutally murdered... Violence between the two communities has been growing. Priest! Who are these people? What's happening here? Narsappa's men are killing Permandlu's men. Police force is trying to control the situation Who must have done that? MLA must have did it. Who else? That guy from the east. Guy from the east? Perumandlu Narsappa ignored Perumandlu ever since Sekharbabu came here. Perumandlu got enraged from that moment. This is a good chance, finished him. Do you know who killed Sekharbabu? Ghost? The curse won't be gone unless the person who killed her is dead. Until then these murders won't stop. Who? She is the queen Ramachandramma. Ramachandramma They're killing all our men... No one survived. You too should escape. Why should I escape? This is my place. I'm ready to face anyone. These are the consequences if you rebel against Narsappa I've killed your men and now I'll sacrifice you to my brother. Catch him before he escapes from the forest. Damn! What kind of a place is this? Are they human or evil? Oh my god! Instead of covering the fair Why are you bothered about investigation? I've got used to messing up with dangerous things... I would rather live on stone soup than die here now. If I stay longer, someone is gonna kill me for sure. I will just leave. I will go home. Where are you going at this hour, Sir? Where are you hurrying late at night? I am going back to my town. I'm leaving for good. The last bus of the day left an hour ago. My life sucks! If I ever take up such assignments again, I'm gonna slap myself. Damn! [CHANTING PRAYERS] [KNOCKING DOOR] [STAMMERS]: Who is it? Sir. You got a trunk call from Hyderabad. Hey! Tell me the truth. Is it a trunk call or has someone came to meet me? Prime Minster Indira Gandhi came seeking your advice on national development. You! Sir, are you coming? Or shall I tell them you already passed out drinking? Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! It’s me, your editor. Sir! Please tell me. What took you so long? I was designing my obituary page, Sir. How is it coming along? Stop kidding, Sir. You have sent me to a dangerous place. Healthy man in the morning here will be a dead body by the end of the day. That's how journalism is. You should be ready to risk your life. Risking life? Nasty guy! I should live in the first place to risk my life, Sir. My grandma always used to caution me. 'How can you become a crime reporter being afraid of the dark?' I never listened. You took up this murder case against my advice. Your actual job begins tomorrow. Sir! Sir! Sir! Please, Sir! I can't do it, Sir! I would rather return to Hyderabad and criticize a bad film or review a lost match, please sir! Fine, then! Forget about your promotion. I don't care about the promotion anymore. I can't stay here even if you offer me the company. Oh no! It's Sekhar babu. Bloody snake bit the little kid. Please hurry up! It's Narsappa's meeting, we can't do anything... God is your only hope. Poor kiddo! Oh ho! How come we are stuck like this? I'm getting late for my bus Isn’t there any other way? Sit down, Sir! There is no space even to budge. They killed a very good person... Wonder who killed him. They killed and tied him to the tree. I'll kill the person who murdered Sekhar. Narsappa is here. Narsappa. - Sekhar Babu! - Long live! - Sekhar Babu! - Long live! - Sekhar Babu! - Long live! God took away the good guy and left the demon. I was suggested to install my brother’s statue in the temple. God confined to four walls doesn’t come out to look after his people. But Sekhar lived for the people. That’s why I put up his statue here in public. I shall not spare the man who killed him whether for power or for spite. Right here. I shall bury him right here at the feet of my brother. [COMMENTARY ON RADIO] A police officer was abducted and killed by twenty Naxalites six months ago? I also know those twenty were shot down by another police officer. The government is sending the same officer to Kollapur for investigating the murder. Greetings, Sir! I am Yadagiri, S.I, Sir! I have heard a lot about your greatness, Sir. You got a long list of encounter killings, Sir! I'm very happy to meet you, Sir! I have done the whole preliminary investigation, Sir. It was confirmed that the bodies belonged to Sekhar Babu and his men. I have ordered for the forensic and postmortem reports, Sir. Did you order tea? No, Sir. Hey, where are you going? - I have to go inside. - You cannot. - Why not? - You can't! That's it. I have some work. - I want to meet the officer… - No way! Hey, I’ll just take a look. It will only take a minute. You are messing with a cop. I'll put you behind the bars. You are too arrogant. Lets see. Hey! Go away from here! Tea sir. Sekhar completed his education in town and came back recently, sir. He has a good reputation in this town. And he has no enemies. This was Lord Narasimha’s temple, Sir. The king of this region had built it. It was closed down after his demise. Later, a guy called Ranga Rao illegally occupied this land and made it his toddy shop. He disappeared after the murder... We are searching for him, Sir. That night, we were all busy at the fair controlling the crowd. We don't know what happened in this toddy shop. This is the crime spot, Sir! Sekhar was tied to this tree and brutally burned to death. The whole town suspects Perumandlu, Sir. He absconded. From which tree is this toddy extracted from? Sir! Taste it and tell me. Nice hairstyle for a police officer. Sir, that's for a vow. Sir! Kalki, Sir! Kalki sir! Let’s go. Hurry up. Wait. Where are you going? - I have to meet, Sir! - What for? I have to tell him something. He has no time for gossip. He is very busy with the case investigation. I'm not here for gossiping. I have something important to share. Why don’t you let me in for a while? No! Just for two minutes. No!! Stop. He is very busy with the investigation. Don’t disturb him. I jumped over bigger walls than this to meet kaveri aunty in private. This is a petty guest house wall after all. So by investigation he meant drinking and listening to radio. That’s a good shot! That's the way to the safe. Sir! I'm not a thief, I'm a journalist. I promise, Sir. My name is Devadatta. I work for Navabharat press. Nice to meet you. Sir, I need to tell you something important. Sir, food carrier! - Keep it there. - Okay sir. You were saying something. I never understand who works for whom in this town, Sir. Yesterday I almost got killed by Perumandlu’s man. Sir! Sir! I know who killed Sekhar Babu, Sir! Is it Perumandlu? Perumandlu is a rouge, Sir. I don’t deny it. But he is not such a fool to kill Sekhar Babu to grab his position. He knows that he gets killed by Sekhar’s brother the very next moment. Then who else would it be? Sir, the guy who killed Sekhar Babu is Go. Let's go. Yes that shot is unexpected delivery from the opponent. Batsman back to pavilion. He is in shock. He will wake up in an hour. Give him some tender coconut water as soon as he wakes up. Who hired this coward for a journalist job? You take care of him. Okay, Sir! You got hurt too. It's miner doctor. - Nurse, get the TT injection ready. - Ok, Sir! Greetings. How is he feeling? He is fine, dear. He is recovering. All thanks to you. Not need to thank. He was brought in time. I should bow to that police officer. I don’t know where he is from. He appeared like a savior on time. If he hadn't showed up, my grandson wouldn’t have survived. What happened? Are you the one who cleared way for the ambulance today morning? This place is surrounded by jungle. and yet dangers caused by people are more than the dangers caused by animals. Be vigilant. We get terrified to make a sound when Narsappa was around. He confronted Narsappa. Look there. That's him. Greetings, Sir! Tell me. My grandson survived because of you. How is he now? He is recovering, Sir! God bless you with a long life! Lord! Take your daughter-in-law. BHALI He is supposed to guard me... Instead he showed attitude towards me... What about him? I sent Yadi in the morning regarding this. I told him to leave a warning but he dropped a bomb instead. That police guy ran away in fear. I'm Kalki IPS! You have come to investigate Sekhar Babu’s case. Starting from Palamuru to Nallamala, people come to me for help to solve their problems. I solve others’ problems. Don't you think I can handle my own? The victim is my younger brother. I haven’t yet offered his oblations to the crows. I will offer them to the vultures which will come for the body of his murderer. Go. Have some toddy and sleep tight. Go. Well said. Well said. Are you always so wise? I have advised my higher officials the same. I told them you can solve your own problems. They didn’t listen and sent me here. Person like you should offer a tiger for sacrifice. why a petty sheep? Hey! Get going. I thought I would miss the world cup matches. As you’re willing to do my work… Let me go and enjoy. This is election time. Situations are nothing like before, Narsappa. You know that there is a new party for competition this time. If you don't stop all these riots... I should answer my higher officials... I can't be open to them about our agreement. Give it a thought. Okay? Hey, boy! There is no one here. Has someone come for me? You think you are a Nawab under Nizam and people die to meet you. - You! - Get lost. Queen Ramachandramma must have become a vengeful spirit and killed him. Holy crap! Damn it! Why are you bothered where people go in the night? Has he gone to the temple to share some offering with you? That’s an old ruined bungalow. Snakes, Bats,... Also ghosts Who’s there? Sir, it’s you! I thought someone else and panicked. You won't panic if it's me? Sir, you’re the one meant to remove fear. Why will I worry, Sir? It looks like you are writing a book on Kollapur. Do you know what will happen if Narsappa comes to know? I know, Sir! I cannot go from here. But if I stay, I'll end up dead. You got to save me, Sir. I’ll help you with the investigation. You said you knew who killed Sekhar Babu? Oh! There was an attempt to murder Sekhar Babu, a few days before his death, Sir. A direct witness has told me. During the recent festival celebrations. Sekhar! He’s on the tree. Catch him! He is running away! Catch him! Hey Anji! Hey! Take him to the doctor. Stop it! Are you going to kill him? Life is valuable, whether it’s mine or his. Yadagiri... Long live, Sekhar Babu! Long live, Sekhar Babu! Long live, Sekhar Babu! Later that guy escaped from the cops. But how come none of this was on record? Even S.I Yadagiri hasn’t mentioned anything. This town is full of Narsappa’s men. You will not find a loyal person. I found him. Come to the government guest house early morning. Let us begin the enquiry. Sir!! How did he entered my locked room? Lock the doors. But before that, latch it. This place looks weird... Is he practicing medicine or black magic? Sir, once people come here they will die without a disease. Had you sniffed at this flower little longer, you would have been dead. Why do you keep such plants out then? Shouldn’t you be careful? This is not money to hide it, Sir! This is medicine. I have a cure for all ailments. Ask me without any inhibition. Give this guy some extract to get rid of his cowardice. Tell him the reason we are here, Sir! He is making an x-ray with his eyes. They had brought a man for treatment on the day of festival. He's asking about Sekhar's guy. Do you mean the guy with the poisonous arrow? Poison? It was the poison from the most dangerous white cobra. It’s like a death sentence. You will die just by touching the poison. Where do we find it? You will find it only in Nagulakona. Nagulakona! It was a small hamlet of thirty families. It turned to ashes in a wild fire. It started at night. We don’t know how many people survived… Parents, kids, old people all of them died in their sleep. Can people sleep so soundly on empty stomachs? That is how wild fire is, Sir. Even a small spark can burn down a whole forest. Dry soil aggravates the fire. Datta... Can you swim? No sir. Gosh! Why did he jump? Sir! Kalki, Sir! Rope, rope, rope... Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Where did you disappear, Sir? My shirt had a stain. You could have wiped it off. Why did you jump into the river? I feel like a lost child in a fair. There at least people will pick up. Here animals will piece me up. You don't understand how worried I'm. To save you, I held a snake instead of rope. I'm lucky the snake didn't bite me. Otherwise, I would have been dead. Please don't leave me alone sir. Kalki is the dove of peace in Kollapur. Did you read it? I wrote this news. - Is it? - Do you want to see my name? Gollam Chandrasekhar. Bloody fool! They throw bombs on me and you put your name in news. A spectacular love story... 'Sita Koka Chilaka' 'Sita Koka Chilaka' Hero Karthik Mucherla Aruna, Sarath babu... Wow! What a movie! Have you watched it? It’s a second release. As if we need a theater to watch such movies. We see plenty of them in the town itself. Are these townsmen so talented? There was a story between Sekhar Babu and a Muslim girl. Girl? Which girl? It’s the lawyer’s daughter. The whole town knows about it. Don’t you? This movie is nothing compared to that story. Your tea is getting cold. Have it, Sir. Forget the tea. Where are they now? Why are you concerned with those stories, Sir? Your tea is getting cold. Damn! Let it get cold. Are they here? They have recently left the town. But why do you bother, Sir? Your tea is getting cold. Have it. Do you know where they went? Oh my! How did you gulp down such hot tea? My money! Hey... Stop! Damn! Stop. Stop. Stop. Hey! Where is your boss? He is watching a movie in Venkateshwara theater. [MOVIE PLAYING] Sir, Kalki Sir! Kalki Sir! Move. Let me through. Hey! Wait! Sir, Kalki sir… Can you come out once? I have something important to tell you. That lawyer’s daughter Asima and Sekhar Babu had some relation. Father and daughter left town on the day after Sekhar Babu died. Definitely there is some connection between that murder and Asima. Sir. What is it, Sir? Asima’s address! Here, have this Goldspot. [OLD SONG PLAYING] I am bored of listening to commentary over radio, Datta! Shall we take this television along? We can watch the world cup final live. Of course, Sir! Why not? Definitely. Greetings! Greetings! I am Datta and he is Kalki IPS! I heard about you. Sit down. We have some work with you... Tell me. I need to speak to your daughter. She is not at home. What is it about? It is about Sekhar Babu’s murder. The murder was in Kollapur, why are you here in Vennicherla? Who do you suspect in Sekhar Babu’s murder? You should ask Narsappa about it. Why did you leave Kollapur immediately after Sekhar Babu’s murder? Why did you leave? As a coincidence the day of our shifting- Was your daughter’s lover murdered? We wouldn’t have come here if they had no relationship. Of course. I didn’t bring up my daughter like the other girls. She did her double PG from Osmania. She had a passion to do something for the town. That is when she got this idea... River Krishna reaches Srisailam crossing the Nallamala forest from Kollapur. My daughter felt a boating company here... It will turn this place into a tourist spot. We asked you to stop at Madarsa. But you sent her to the city. Now look at her. She talks about boats and business. I would stop her if she had selfish motives. But this is for social welfare… This is not good Mr. Lawyer. No good will come out of going against religion. Don’t involve religion in this. I have read the Quran. Keep quiet. Brother. what’s wrong in her thinking? Tourism will develop in Kollapur and a lot of people will find livelihood. The town will prosper. The lawyer is right... - Let's see. - Forget about the girl... He did a lot of welfare for our society... - If he is insisting... - Let's do it. An idea from a woman’s mind is no good. Drop dead then. Who is that arrogant fellow? Sekhar Babu! Probably a birth from a woman is no good either, Salim uncle. So kill yourself. Our way of life has changed with time. If we go brandishing swords on horses because our forefathers were invaders, the police will break the bones and throw us in jail. Sekhar Babu... It is something related to their religion. This is related to humanity. You better stay in your limits. Are you defining my limits? Just try and understand. Those who object now will follow you once it’s prosper. Begin your company work. Ask me for any sort of help. I will see who will stop you. Three boats carrying sixty people... Started from Kollapur to Srisailam. What happened, Sir? Those boats never reached Srisailam nor did they return to Kollapur. My daughter had a good thought... The incident took toll on religions... That’s why we left the town. You say three boats had sunk. One boat is an accident but three boats spell a scheme. I advise you for your own good. It is better you forget this matter and leave the town. I suspect Sekhar Babu was killed because he tried to find out the truth. Why didn’t you file a case in spite of being a lawyer? I couldn’t find proper proofs. The only witness refused to come to the court. Who is the witness? Samba Shivam! You cannot bring him to the witness stand. They have left. On the auspicious occasion of Dussehra... If you give ghaf leaves to elders and seek their blessings... It is as effective as having sought God's blessings. Sir, the officer is investigating inspite of your warning... He met the lawyer... He is asking information about the drowned boats There is the bird. See it. Take the leaf... Sir... My son didn't kill Sekhar Babu. We are innocent. People are hunting us like pigs because we our with Permandlu. Even a stone hearted man will show mercy when offered a mimosa. You are our Rama. Consider me you were Vibhishana and spare me. You are a righteous man, Sir. You are a righteous man, Sir. Sir. He told us so much... But yet he didn't tell where she is. She was at home. Is it? She’s not here. Do you think she killed him? You should've beat the truth out of her. Outside the toddy shop... There were pieces of broken bottles. Some of the glass pieces had blood stains. Forensics stated the blood stains belong to someone else. You think the lawyer killed him? The lawyer looks like cruel guy... We're yet to discover who these blood stains belong to. Then there is something wrong sir... Sekhar helped them to organize boating company. You should've been a police officer instead of a journalist. What happent? Did you say goodbye at home? You would have died for the impact. Sir! I must go to the hospital immediately. My vehicle is under repair, Sir. Get in. Doctor Madam! Come fast! Don’t worry madam. This is not a Naxalite vehicle. This is a police vehicle with full security. Get in madam. I don’t know how my wife is. I beg you madam, please get in. [RADIO PLAYING] My wife is very sensitive. I wonder how she is managing. You are very fond of your wife, man. I have only one wife, Sir. Like everyone has 100 wives? I am getting married next year. By the way, Sir, why aren’t you married? [SONG ON RADIO] Datta! You keep leaving the bottles around. I cannot stand this smell. You drink toddy right at the crime spot, And you don't like alcohol smell? Oh this? That's mine. I have kept it there. Doctor suggested medicine for proper sleep. That’s why I am using this madam. Oh no! If I talk more he might throw me out of the vehicle like radio. Sir, we have crossed the hospital. Sir, may God bless you. I'll see you soon. What is this, madam? We were trying to help you and you are insulting us offering this. This is not travel service from Srisailam – Kollapur bus. Datta! Right! Right! If she embarrassed a police officer like you, there must be a story between you two, Sir. I am sure, Sir. Won’t she remember her own hospital? Tell me the story. Please tell me sir. In Kullu Manali while I was working with the CRPF. Alpha calling base. Over. Base responding. Over. Code red. Need medical assistance. Over. What is the situation? Over. Our Chinese ambassador is in critical condition. Need medical assistance over. Bring the HAWK to the base. Over. He won't last that long. Over. Do one thing take him to Medical camp at third exit. Over. All vehicles take third exit on the highway. How are you feeling? Better. Nurse. Take care of the patient, I'll be right back. - Doctor. - What happened sir? He was breathless all of a sudden and fainted. Please help us. Bring him in quick. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax ... Nurse, give me the scalpel quickly. Cotton and spirit too. Stop it. We have informed our embassy. Our doctors are on the way. We can't wait for them sir. We do not trust you, Indian doctors. I cannot keep quiet when someone is losing their life. I said back off. Back off! Can you save him? With 4 inch needle incision and chest tube incision... Can you save him or not? Yes, I can. Then save him. I trust her. Let her do her duty. Kalki, what are you doing? He is a Chinese Ambassador. If something happens to him during the treatment, there will be a war between the two countries. Boys, guns down. If you don’t let her save him, I will kill him myself Please start the treatment. He is out of danger. Indian doctor.

My deputation period was done... I was posted in Vikarabad. I was about to tell her the same thing... She called me. Hello. I'm going back home. Please talk to my father. You were so close in Kashmir. Why are you distant here? You guys don't talk to each other any more. Tell me what happened after that, Sir? After all I am a reporter. I will not leave you until I squeeze the whole story from you. Where does Samba Shivam live? You mean the priest? He went to Mallellatirdham to get water for anointing. There he comes. [CHANTING] Priest... We need to speak to you. We are coming from Kabir Khan. We need to talk to you about the sunken boats. I have spoken to the right people about it. Whatever will happen will happen. [CHANTING] “All desires of people are fulfilled in great amounts.” The incantations you chant daily teach you that people who reach out to Hanuman will certainly be helped. You worship him every day. Can’t you do us a small favour? Sir is a police officer. Kalki IPS. Kalki! The tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. I set out to Mallellatirdham for holy water as usual. I could hear the chanting of Lord Shiva’s name. That was the first time I saw steamers in this area. The three steamers are full of devotees. The whole region was filled with fervor. In the distance from the boats. There were shapes moving in the water They looked like crocodiles. As soon as the steamers approached them, they sprang from water like whales. Wearing masks six of them attacked three steamers. There was no sound. Not a drop of blood. People who tried to escape... They hunted down every single person, killed them drowning them in water. I had to silently watch the devotees getting swept away by water. If you come to the station Forgive me! Mr. Kabir Khan had done a lot for our place. I told him because he was feeling guilty of a sin he never committed. I have dedicated my life to Lord Hanuman. Please don’t expect me at the station or the court. Your evidence can bring justice to those who lost their lives. Hanuman can only help. To wage the war. It’s Rama. Kalki Sir! What happened? Asima! She is in my station. You can come. Where is the warrant? Where is the lady constable? How dare you hit the lawyer for asking this? How did you arrest my suspects without my permission? Narsappa asked me to bring her. Is this police station or his property? Do this again and I will shoot you in an encounter. Move! Your boss is here. Where is she? What is your business with her? Mr. Kalki! I have already cautioned you not to interfere in our affairs. You are not here for sunken boats or razed huts. You are here to capture my brother’s murderer. If you are not capable, give up right now. It’s her people who killed my brother. Bring her to me. It’s me who has to declare the murderer. Bali! How will you blame Asima a culprit without any evidence? Is it to protect the actual murderer? You accused Perumandlu and he disappeared Why? so that there is no opposition? You reached the crime scene as soon as the police arrived that night as if you already knew about it. Sekhar Babu was becoming more popular than you. So did you kill him and now putting up a show, Narsappa? I advised you in kind words, but you ignored it. I sent men. But you never changed. No more of your childish acts. I will swallow you like a tiger swallows a chicken. Well said! Well said! Swallowing, drowning, torching will never take place in Kollapur. Your time is up. Thank God! My work is done. So, I’ll pack my things and leave if you drop me at the hotel, sir. Sir! Tell me your opinion about the headline. Elder brother murdered his younger brother for authority! Headline is good but who is the brother? Narsappa, sir! You said earlier, right? Did you witness the murder? No. How would I know? I too don’t know. Why did you give warning to Narsappa earlier, sir? We need evidence to arrest someone but not to warn. Why did Narsappa leave without saying anything? It means that he is hiding something. My bad! I already thought how come I leave this place soon. But, one thing is true. Your warning was frightful. But, there’s one issue. What’s that? Padma madam saw you from behind when Asima hugged you. Did Padma see? Sir! This murder mystery is not getting solved. Tell the story happened between you and madam, sir. Please sir. We shouldn't wait anymore. We must kill the cop. Cops are politician's pet... There is no point in killing them. Our country is democracy for namesake. But a place full of thieves. We don't need to show mercy on these dogs. All your men are dead. Only you are left. Surrender. I'll shoot if you come closer. No. He is not a moaist. He is school's headmaster. Moaist sympathizer How can you shelter fanatics where Gandhi and Tagore are destined to be created? Gandhi cannot destroy this feudalistic system. We need people like Bose, Bhagat Singh. No philosophy that wields a gun can reach its goal. Why are you holding a gun then? My weapon is for protecting democracy. My weapon is to punish the government for looting people. Calm down... Please don't cry. Padma. I didn't do it on purpose... It's my duty. He is my Father. I didn't know that, but I can't do anything in that situation. Whatever might be the circumstances. You killed my father, don't kill me now... Go away! I feel very sorry for you... But I didn't commit any mistake.

Sir, sir... - Let's get out of this place... - What happened? What's wrong? Sir, there is a ghost in that bangalow that's why the jeep broke down. Ghost? I never saw one. Let's go see. Stop mocking me sir... let's get out of this place. Who is he? He is my hotel owner, sir. He's been roaming at nights from the past one week. Where is he going at this hour? Let’s go and check. I cannot see anyone, sir. There’s no one here. There is no one here, right? We've heard stories about one-eyed monsters in our childhood... I guess he is the same guy. Sir, this is Kollapur King's palace The Queen was brutally burned to death here. Her spirit has been haunting the palace ever since. I witnessed it a few times. Let's go back, sir. Listen to me, sir. Sir, you don’t get it. It was on to me. It is very big. Ghost….Ghost! I told you that there’s a ghost here, sir. No, sir. Let's go. Come. Please sir, let’s go! No sir. He is the hotel owner. Who is this guy? Ranga Rao! He is the owner of toddy winery that was burnt. I saw him while escaping from there that day. Why did you kill Mr. Sekharbabu? I didn't kill Mr. Sekharbabu. I went to watch drama that day. You can ask him if you want. I don’t know him. I just met him when I came to pee. You are bringing him lunch everyday without even knowing him? Sir will use hands only once. He gives salvation later on. Sir… I love money but I am not that bad to take someone’s life. Believe me. This is what happened that day. Hey, Ranga. Sir. Coming. Sir. Ranga… Your shop have the real festival celebration. There’s nothing like that, sir. Okay. My friends came from the city. Clear the place. Normal day would be fine... Today is a fest, sir. So, there’s demand. Take it. It's a diamond watch. Take my diamond watch to compensate. I will get it vacated, sir. Hey! Stop drinking everyone. The store is closed for the day. Leave… Leave. When it is found that Sekhar babu died in my store.. Narsappa will kill me first So, I disguised myself in a saree and hiding here. I swear on my Goddess! I know nothing more than this. Did you find anyone suspicious that day? Anyone with knives or kerosene? You would anyway ask that question next. So, I asked. As it was a fair. Many outsiders will come. How can I say? Sir… What shall we do with them, sir? You tell me... It’s alright sir, let them go. Sir! You remind me of our king Balkishan Rao sir. If felt the same thing... Even if they are feeling the same, it might be true. I should have a sword in my hands, But I have a pen. Datta! Datta… Sir ! Sambasivam! Alias Raja Ratnam. Did you come for the priest again? Yes. Where is he? There! He’s going to Mallela coast. I usually pick him and drop him once everyday. Now he has been going thrice these days Why is he going the other way... Keep following him. Sir! Sambasiva has something in his bag. Carrier. Carrier? For whom? Guess. There is someone in the hut. Who did Sambasiva hide in this jungle? I said whatever I knew. I don’t know anything more than that. You know better than anyone here. Mr. Raja Ratnam! Kollapur Royal Institute Advisor... Whom did you hide in there? I'm talking to you! Is it queen Chandramma? Perumandlu! Perumandlu You've followed so far... Don't. You stay silent. You know nothing. He is a cop. It doesn’t matter to me if he is a cop. Perumandlu You should come to the station for helping Perumandlu the accused. Did you try to hide your son and escape him from punishment? I failed as a servant when I couldn't save the Queen. Watching my own son set the Palace on fire... I was dead as a father. I couldn't save anyone from the Royal lineage. Narasappa is the reason behind this. I hope my son realizes his treason and changes. It's a small hope. So you decided to save a culprit from punishment. I might save him from punishment but not from karma. Permandlu Priest! Priest! Nothing is a coincidence… It’s… It all happened according to karma… “Hero, legendary hero… Spiteful star” “Courageous, Determined…" "Celestial conqueror” “Hey! Your fist is a thunder…Tenacious-like” “Hey! Timid creature. The most terrifying” “Impede your wickedness” “This is your battle” “You’re the axe that slays opponent” “You’d be the destructive creature for invading enemy” “Making it understandable by denial” “Let your roaring hunt begin” “Keep chasing like a wildfire” “The hero of sage’s daughter, You’re the champion in a tussle” “You’re multitude of Indra” “Your blood is dribbled everywhere, It's like a surging wave” “Your greatest weapon is your anger” “Hey! Your fist is a thunder… Tenacious-like” “Hey! Timid creature” “The most terrifying” “Impede your wickedness, This is your battle” I am unwell, sir. I’ll come to you in couple of days. Sir! He went into the forest... So I sent our men to kill him... It's dusk. None of our men have returned... Is he a monster to kill so many men. He's a government servent. Bloody fools! You guys can't kill him... He'll be dead in my hands. I will kill him. What's with those masked men? What's with all the stabbing? What's with some man in exile? Forget that. Why did you bring Perumandlu home for a drink? He's a murderer. He has committed many crimes in company with Narsappa. How could you believe he will testify against Narsappa? He is a very vicious and cruel person, Sir. You're taking a huge risk. To hell with risks. Awards and rewards are a consequence of risks. Who do you think killed Sekhar? Is it the archer? Is it Asima? Is it Perumandlu? I won't spare him. Vent your anger on Narsappa. Not here. What did Raja Ratnam tell you before dying? My dad was helpless and he would attribute everything to Karma. He’s dead now. Narsappa has made a fool of me. He betrayed me Why would he sit idle when you killed his baby brother? Do you think so much commotion is required to kill Sekharbabu? Narsappa’s motive was to reduce my popularity in Kollapur. That’s why he turned a lie into truth. I even defied my father for him and looted the treasury. I set fire to the royal palace. I stood between him and death for thirty years. Yet he pushed me aside. That’s why I joined the new party. I used to wonder why he was tolerating when Sekhar was obstructing our usual business. I understand now. He wanted two birds at one shot. He got rid of his brother and framed me for the murder. I will not rest until I see his blood. [SNORING] You won't sleep until the revenge is taken. You ate well and slept snoring. You are shameless. What is this, sir? New people enter the scene as if it is a archeological excavation. Who are you, man? Why don’t you speak? What do you want? Vengeance! Oh! Do you want vengeance? How much? Is little fine? You should get kicked! Hush! Why did you plan to kill Mr. Sekharbabu? Sekhar babu? You’ve been following us from the time we came to that burnt hamlet. There is good chance for dry land to catch wildfire. But, there is no dry land near the hamlet. Houses were burnt and nothing happened to the trees around. It is true that the hamlet is burnt. But, wildfire is not the reason. Tell me, what happened? They killed, sir. My mom and brother they killed everyone. Let her go! Let my mother go! They don’t have the fate to live, sir. I decided to kill him before I die. He should know my pain before he dies. So, I decided to kill his brother. Why did they slaughter an entire village? I know. I will help you get justice. - Pattabhi! - Sir. Make arrangements for Suri to stay tonight. Okay, sir. Sir… Perumandlu! He ran away. What shall we do now, sir? Simple! We should get a new glass. We can get another window but not Perumandlu who escaped from it. Pattabhi! - Search entire Kollapur... - Yes sir. Especially Perumandlu accomplices’ houses. - Okay sir. - Arrange surveillance near Narsappa house. - Okay sir. Perumandlu might attack Narsappa. We should arrest him before the attack. How will you capture Narsappa without Perumandlu? Your charioteer! Charioteer? Find out how he is doing. Why don’t you ask, sir? Yeah! I can ask him too. How is he, madam? Why? Will you beat him again? Ask her to answer, Datta! Right foot is fractured. There’s a sharp cut near abdomen. Neck ligament has a sprain. Bruises and swellings in multiple places! There could be concussion due to head injury. How is the thumb finger? What? How is the thumb finger? Imprint your thumb. I, Ranga… I purposefully attacked Kalki who’s the officer in duty. I agree that Kollapur MLA Narsappa propelled me to do so and submit this testimony. Hey. Ranga! Don’t be hasty. Give me those papers. Okay… Datta! Find out if he has a daughter. If so, let’s go and ask for forgiveness. She might think that we intentionally did it without knowing the truth. What is his physical condition? He is dead, sir. I will not ask how he is dead because I know you. But, Narsappa is ruling party MLA. This evidence won’t be sufficient to arrest him. A deadly fire! More than hundred people were burnt alive. We have live evidence, sir. The Nagulakona incident, it is not a wildfire. It is a planned attack. Suri is a witness. Narsappa, Perumandlu killed our people and burnt the hamlet, sir. Not just this. They also killed 50 people by drowning boats going from Kohlapur to Srisailam Why did they do this? Smuggling! In Kollapur not just animals and human beings... There is no protection for the forest. The moment I realized forest fire was not the culprit in Nagulakona, I examined the surroundings... I found all my answers in the river flowing by. There is only one reason for the boats to sink and the village to burn. The sandalwood available in Nallamala forest. They burnt the hamlet down as they were an obstruction. Since there are no checks on the river, they chose the river for transporting the logs. They feared Asima’s boating company would attract crowd and affect the smuggling. So they sank the boats. I suspect Sekhar Babu was killed in an attempt to investigate this. This case will only close after Narsappa's arrest. I have evidence for all of it, sir. It is not easy to arrest Narsappa. The village is under his control. Give me permission Narsappa will be locked up by morning. Hey. Hey. Get up! Get up! You ate well and slept like lazy bugs. Fatso! Wake up! Are you guys dead? Useless fellows! Get up! Get up! Bali, What happened to you? Bali. Shall we go? You're still alive only because I spared you. You blamed me for my brother's murder... You made a fool out of me in my own place. What you said the other day is true... I should be sacrificing you. Not a lamb or tiger. Well said... It's my turn now. I saw your weakness first... That is why I put this dove at your place. That day only I said to calm down… ! Did u listen? You tried to kill me... But it's not so easy to kill me. I'm Kalki. You thought I drank and slept after listening to you? I was planning to trap you. We'll cross Kollapur before sunrise. Your time is up! Hey! You guys still didn't eat? We don't eat after getting drunk. if you don’t eat after booze. You’ll puke What is that? Bloody idiot! What are you doing? I'm going to pee, will you come along? It is not even morning yet. Why will they graze the sheep? Sir... Something is fishy. Narsappa. Come. Move. Move. Move! If you want to get me out of Kollapur before sunrise, you should know history of Kollapur as well as me in total. Two leaders Narsappa and Perumandlu were dead in Kollapur firing. Investigating officer Kalki is found injured. Asima stands as a single candidate. Kohlapur will have good days ahead. You need to rest for two weeks. Bring these medicines. Good. Excuse me. How is he feeling now? He is in too much pain, madam. But, he will be fine as you are here now. Come. Come, madam. What happened, madam? I misunderstood him all these days. I don’t know how to face him now. It is quite common for human beings to do mistakes. Why do you think so much to get closer? You should think when you have to depart. Sir loves you a lot. He dreams about you in sleep. Come madam... Please drink some more. Madam. Padma… Don’t misunderstand our relation. I believe in what I see. Please wait. I should share something important with you. I haven’t shared it with my dad… I have to tell you. I came to know that someone sank my boats on purpose I went in search of Mr. Sekharbabu after hearing the news. Asima! What are you doing here? My friends came for the fest. I am hosting a party. The boats didn't sink by accident... Someone intentionally sunk them. Whatever happened that day wasn’t a tragedy. They intentionally killed everyone. A man who witnessed told me everything. Who is he? Don't worry... What is your plan now? I will approach the court. I need your help. See, Asima... You’re saying that the boats were sunk. You might risk your life if you go against them. 60 people are dead. The one who did it must be punished. Okay. Tell me who that is. I’ll bring him safely to the court. He is afraid. I will convince him and bring him. I will not spare them. They should be sentenced to death. They were disguised. Whom will you lodge the case on? How do you know that they’re disguised? My father will be searching for me. I am leaving. Take care, Asima. It happens when you don’t take your steps carefully. My father might be searching for me. Tell me who that witness is. Perumandlu. The one who said who did it must also say who made them do it. He is a faithful person, Asima. But, he doesn’t do things in the right manner. I asked him to burn the houses but he spared someone there. He tried to kill me. He left one person alive when I sent him to drown the boats. I will become the bad guy if I spare him today, Asima. Why did you cheat? Someone else will arrange the boats if not you. No one will dare to arrange if they get drowned on the first day. That is why I pushed you to do it and got them drowned. You are much worse than your brother. Why are you comparing me with him? Strength fears people. Anyone who fears will be meek until his fear is gone. But, a faithful person will stay by your side forever. Tell me who witnessed it and I will spare you. I will never reveal his identity even if my life is at risk. Leave me! Your corpse will be found in this temple tomorrow morning. The cops will shiver looking at your burnt body. The cops will take your burnt body to the hospital. The doctors will test you and say two things. First is that 8 people raped you. Second... It will be about the injuries on your body. Sekhar babu…Please. They’ll find out in the morning that it is Muslim girl Asima’s body. People think that Asima is the one who took lives of 50 Hindus. They must’ve killed her to take revenge. This would be the gossip in the village. There will be violence between the communities... The village will turn into a graveyard. I will come after some of them dead. I will apply bandage. People will treat me as deity. Leave me! - Hey! - Boss! Leave me! Sekhar babu, please leave me! Sekhar babu please! Oh God! In order to save my reputation... Kalki didn’t tell this matter to anyone. We are not like Radha-Krishna! We’re like Draupadi-Krishna! - Where is the phone? - I don’t know. I should make a call to Hyderabad. Where is the phone? It is over there. SP sir. I should tell him. I knew you'd do something like this when you asked sincerely. I was expecting Narasappa But you killed Perumadhal Very smart move, Kalki. Narasappa sent him, right? I just want to find him. Suppose you found him. What will you do? I'll fire bullets as long as I'm content. I'll bring Narsappa via Ghat road tomorrow. Oh Kalki sir... Get well soon. This is your plan? Hello. Hello, sir! Can you hear me, sir? Sir! This is Datta speaking from Kollapur. - Hello… - Son… - Room no. 103… - Hey! Go away! How is the case progressing? Sekharbabu was killed by… Narsappa, Perumandlu were dead because of… Not Suri, Asima or the ghosts, sir. Who is it? Hello. Room no. 103 Hello. Hello Datta... Who killed Sekhar babu? Hello? Rama Chandramma - How are you? - I'm good. Please come. How are you? I'm good mother. I couldn't save anyone from the Royal lineage. You never tell me on which mission you are working. I didn’t know until Pattabhi called that you came to Kollapur. You never listen to me. Mom! What are you looking at? Did we come here before? No! Why would we come here? We have no purpose. Did the queen and prince escaped the attack on Palace. Ramachandramma didn't tell Kalki about their past. He came to Kollapur looking for his love. He started hunting for the culprits involuntarily. In the same fire Narsappa set to the Royal palace... Narsappa's brother Sekhar Babu burned to death. Why did government send him to investigative officer to solve the case. The animals he is bound to hunt are in fact human. So he crushed and killed them. Just like Narsappa destroyed Kalki's family using Perumandlu... Kalki wrecked Narsappa taking advantage of Perumandlu. Kalki assumes he fulfilled his official duty for Kollapur. In fact, he fulfilled his Royal duties for the people. That means, according to the priest... This isn’t a coincidence… It happened according to karma… Come dear. Stop it! This is too much. Too much? Tell everyone about the incident. Tell them! Tell them! Sorry, brother. Sir... What happened? Why is he in such frenzy? That’s how sincere police officers are, Sir. Sir, just a moment. Fury will only affect your Blood pressure. How will it solve the case? Sir, you are an experienced officer. He is amateur. Spare him, Sir. What is the matter? Sir, a scientist is dead. He is a Nobel Prize winner. His body was found in a remote village. His death suggests a super human hand. But no one is able to solve the mystery, Sir. Let’s go then.
