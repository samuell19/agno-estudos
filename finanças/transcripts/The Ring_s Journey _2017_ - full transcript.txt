"The Little League Championship Ring" ﻿Nitzhia, where's the little league championship ring? ﻿Mr. Maaravi, it's Shula, your new secretary. Wait, I'll go check. ﻿Come in, Lior, have a seat. ﻿Nitzhia, or whatever your name is, ﻿bring us something to drink, please. ﻿What is it, Lior? ﻿Mr. Maaravi, I was thinking... ﻿I hardly ever play. Actually, I never play. ﻿What are you implying, Lior? ﻿That "Maccabi Tel Aviv" basketball club ﻿doesn't favor Israeli players? ﻿No, of course not, God forbid. ﻿Does the name Aulcie Perry ring a bell? ﻿Of course. - And Earl Williams? ﻿And Jim Boatwright, bless his memory? ﻿What's that?! ﻿Don't you like cranberry juice? ﻿You're fired. ﻿Yes, so where were we? ﻿Mr. Maaravi, I don't want to be a poster boy. ﻿A poster boy? ﻿I'm not familiar with that term. ﻿You're part of a "national team". ﻿Right, but I want to play. ﻿And you did, against "Ha'Poel Migdal Ha'Emek". ﻿Yeah, three months ago... ﻿For 20 seconds. ﻿Don't you have any respect for almost a minute, ﻿you played for "Maccabi Tel Aviv"? ﻿No, of course not. Mr. Maaravi, ﻿truth is, I got an offer from another team. ﻿Do you remember you have a release fee of a million dollars? ﻿Yes, I was hoping you'd waive that. ﻿Which team approached you? "Ha'Poel Tel Aviv". ﻿I'm sorry... it's... ﻿it's from... ﻿it's the retirement home. ﻿Hello? ﻿What? ﻿It's my grandma. ﻿She died. ﻿She must've heard you want to play for "Ha'Poel". ﻿We've gathered here today under these sad circumstances ﻿to read the will of the late Bolba Lipski ﻿which was found in the safe in her room at the retirement home. ﻿I dislike meddling in everyday matters such as these ﻿when it's not even a day since she died. ﻿Come on, Riddler, it's almost time for Sheftel's program. ﻿This here is the will, in these words: ﻿"I, Bolba Lipski, ﻿"hereby leave my entire fortune to my grandsons Udi and Lior Lipski." ﻿How disappointing, Lior, ﻿now you'll have to share grandma's walker with your brother. "Five million dollars!" ﻿Where did she get that kind of money?! ﻿"Under the condition that within a month of reading this will ﻿"my eldest grandson, Udi Lipski, gets married. ﻿"If Udi does not wed within a month, the money will be given to..." -Me? ﻿"To the human rights organization in Jaffa." ﻿To those leftists?! ﻿What have you done, Mother?! What have you done?! ﻿"Regarding my beloved son Nachman, ﻿"who charged me rent for the room I lived in ﻿"and then put me in a home as soon as I got ill..." ﻿Why? ﻿Why did you have to dump her in a home?! ﻿But... ﻿You're the one who dumped her there. - Why did you agree?! ﻿"He won't be left with nothing. ﻿"I am bestowing upon him... "my walker." ﻿"And with this ring Udi must be wed." ﻿What? What ring? ﻿What is this bullshit?! ﻿And... ﻿I was thinking, after Udi gets married, ﻿I'll be able to pay my contract release fee to "Maccabi" ﻿and join "Ha'Poel". ﻿Reef is in shock. ﻿I thought I'm marrying a "Maccabi" player, not some loser from "Ha'Poel". ﻿We'll get the money and you'll keep playing for "Maccabi". ﻿Maybe well start a fashion line... "R L". ﻿But I want to play basketball. - So pick up your game! "R L" stands for Reef and Lior, not Reef and Loser. ﻿Go on. Give Udi the ring. ﻿But he hasn't left his room in three years. Where will he find a bride? ﻿I'm sure your friend Bechor can hook him up with some bimbo. ﻿We'll get the ring, the boy won't get married, ﻿and we'll take all the loot. - You're talking nonsense. ﻿If the boy doesn't get married, ﻿the money goes to that leftist organization. -Exactly. ﻿I happen to be on the organization's directing committee. ﻿I decide what comes in and what goes out. ﻿Look, look, ﻿he's going to give him the ring. ﻿Why are you such a snoop?! ﻿I hate that about you! ﻿Udi? ﻿It's Lior. ﻿Just wanted to tell you that Grandma passed away yesterday. ﻿She left five million dollars in her will. ﻿If you get married, we get all the money, ﻿and if not, then it goes to some organization. ﻿Me? Get married? ﻿We'd split everything. ﻿Yes? ﻿Including Raphaela? ﻿I don't care about your money, Harry Schmucker. ﻿Forgot where the door is? - The door... ﻿Oh... ﻿Grandma also left you a ring. ﻿If you put the ring on my finger, ﻿it won't give me an electric shock. ﻿It's okay, Harry Schmucker, I don't care about her. ﻿Udi... ﻿Yeah, I'm ready, bring the girls. ﻿You scared me. - Why are you yelling? -Look at you! ﻿Stop it, Arwenush... ﻿Arwenush, stop, hands off... ﻿Stop, Arwenush, you're tickling me. ﻿The eye! ﻿Udi? ﻿The eye, I saw the eye. ﻿What? ﻿Take here away from here. ﻿"My beloved bride "Come to my garden..." ﻿I said, "My beloved bride, come to my garden..." "Come to my garden..." ﻿Stay back. ﻿What's with him? ﻿You've come to steal my ring. ﻿Just the opposite, bro, I got you this princess. ﻿Yikes! ﻿Princess? ﻿From what kingdom? - God save me... ﻿Bechor, let's go. Let's go. ﻿Go where? This is your groom. ﻿Him?! ﻿For God's sake! ﻿In your face! - Hold on! He's not... ﻿Yalla! - Come back! ﻿Shadowfax! - Shadow-fuck yourself! ﻿Now we need to find you a new bride. ﻿He didn't mean it. ﻿Bechor... -Don't worry, I'm a get-away driver. -And it's no metaphor. ﻿Meta-what? ﻿Who gave you a license? ﻿They actually didn't. ﻿Sorry, Bunji. ﻿Is he necessary? - More than all of you. ﻿Who's the driver? ﻿Some Middle Easterner named Bechor Yom Tov. ﻿What's his profession? ﻿Theft, debt. Typical Middle Easterner. ﻿Remember, bedtime is 23:00 pm the latest. ﻿All uninvited passengers are requested to get off, thank you. ﻿Nobody tells Reef what to do. ﻿Who's Reef? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Where can we find girls? - Who is that? What does he want? ﻿I don't know, it's a butt. ﻿I'm new in town, and don't know anyone. ﻿I live in some hole... ﻿Are you on the guest list? - I have a membership card. ﻿A member... to remember. ﻿Whoa, whoa, whoa... ﻿Go home. ﻿I have to get in, I'm looking for love. - Love? ﻿Pal, you'll find love across the street. ﻿At the bureka stand. ﻿Dude, he's with me. - He's with you? ﻿But this isn't a snooker and bar fights kind of club. -Huh? ﻿And you don't stick dollar bills on strippers' bellies. -Say what?! ﻿There's no disgusting music either. - What about the music, you fucker?! ﻿One guy in a costume and another in an undershirt. -They're with me. ﻿We're with her. ﻿Any weapons? ﻿Put down the sword and slingshot. - It's a bow and arrow. ﻿Row and barrow, who cares. Get out! ﻿Dima, it's alright. ﻿Elvfs, here I come! ﻿Do you speak Elvish? ﻿Do you speak Elvish? ﻿Do you speak Elvish? ﻿Listen, nobody here speaks Elvish. ﻿Take this crap off of you, and talk to them nicely and gently. ﻿Listen... - Do you speak Elvish? ﻿Do you speak Elvish? ﻿Galadrielush! ﻿You're such a weirdo. ﻿A star has shone upon our union. ﻿Hebrew, sweetie, what is it? ﻿You're much prettier in person. ﻿Do you follow me on Instagram, sweetie? ﻿I've got a photo of you on my wall. ﻿Sweetie! ﻿I'm so excited to see you, Galadrielush! - Shontalush. ﻿I've got a million questions for you. - Easy there, sweetie. ﻿What's the rush, naughty boy? ﻿I was always curious to know... where did you disappear to? ﻿When did I ever disappear? - In "The Return of the King". ﻿The king is back?! I knew Elvis was alive; ﻿and that Rabin wasn't murdered. Someone stood there yelling: "Kidding!" ﻿You got on a ship and sailed away. - What ship? ﻿You mean, the float at the gay parade? Man, you're so high! ﻿Where are you going, sweetie? ﻿Good evening, Lorien! ﻿I'd like to propose to my chosen one. ﻿That was quick. ﻿Galadrielush... ﻿Shontalush. ﻿Will you marry me? ﻿Sweetie, you really went all out! ﻿Ouch! It shocked me! Is this a joke?! ﻿She's not the one! - I'm gonna kick your ass! ﻿There will be no wedding. ﻿Yuck, who would marry you, fatso?! ﻿I wouldn't even let you lick my balls. ﻿Ouch! ﻿You're not Galadrielush. ﻿I'll choke you with my dick! Let's see who's a man! Get up! ﻿Come on, beat it! - Don't touch me, I'm a virgin. ﻿Beat it, asshole! - I can't believe you said that. ﻿Well, believe it. Now, fuck off, man. "Fuck off, woman", can't you see I'm a woman? ﻿You got a serious head-butt, huh? ﻿Tell me, ﻿how did you electroshock him? That was a neat trick! ﻿Could it be true? ﻿You know it is. ﻿Listen, stud, ﻿you're not cut out for Tel Aviv. I'll take you to Moran's village, ﻿it's loaded with hot Yemeni girls. Well find you a real hottie. ﻿Watch it, you're getting the van dirty! ﻿Don't feed Bunji! ﻿Outside the city you get only Arabic stations. ﻿Why doesn't anyone fix that problem? - Mr. Orlitzki, ﻿of course I transferred the restitution for the Lodz Ghetto. ﻿You forgot because of the Alzheimer's ﻿and you forget you have Alzheimer's because of the Alzheimer's. ﻿You're helping Lodz Ghetto survivors? ﻿I'd understand if it were the Warsaw Ghetto. ﻿At least they had an uprising. ﻿The Lodz Ghetto really disappointed me. ﻿Ariel, am I in? ﻿Its the middle of the night... I don't know yet. ﻿Shitty agent... ﻿What happened? - Nothing. ﻿You just spoke with someone. ﻿But he was useless, what's there to understand? ﻿I got to get some sleep or else Maaravi will suspend me. -Sleep on the bench. ﻿He never lets you play anyway, right? ﻿Bechor, could you change that crappy music? ﻿Come on, Bechor, change the music, please. ﻿How's that? ﻿Goes well with the donkey smell. ﻿Hello? - Bechor, listen. ﻿I've got a very interesting business proposal for you. ﻿What? - All you need to do is, ﻿to bring us the ring. - Who is this? ﻿Never mind. - Who?! ﻿Okay, girls, we're here. ﻿Raphaela. ﻿What did you call me? I'm Reef. ﻿Why? -Ever hear of a beauty queen named Raphaela Golomb? ﻿I didn't know beauty queens were chosen by name. ﻿Kid! Where can find the girls? - At the synagogue. ﻿Girls! ﻿Are you coming? - I'm busy. ﻿Go on, I'll be right there. ﻿Not yet. ﻿Why not? - We have to catch him in the act. ﻿What? ﻿We can't stop him in his tracks. ﻿Riddler, we're paying him from your cut. ﻿Not a dime. ﻿But you're already taking half the loot as a service fee! ﻿It's a lot of service... Nachman. ﻿A hobbit it. ﻿An ordinary penguin... ﻿A limping penguin... ﻿Tell me, are you cuckoo? ﻿You know what a lama is? - Lama? ﻿A lama, the animal that spits. - Oh! ﻿Here's an impression of an indecisive lama. ﻿Oh, you do impressions! Here's one of Michael Jordan slam-dunking. ﻿Or this one: A truck doing the moon-walk. ﻿Or this one: Gandalf from "The Lord of the Rings" ﻿as a bouncer at a club when Ethiopians arrive... "You shall not pass!" ﻿You're the one! I want to marry you, hobbit lady. ﻿Get married?! Are you nuts?! ﻿You think you'll win me over with a ring? I have high standards. ﻿You're no hobbitit, you're Gimli! - I'm not Gimli, I'm Gamliel! ﻿Give me back the ring! ﻿I'm not giving it back! - You greedy dwarf! ﻿Finders, keepers! ﻿There's a man in the women's section! ﻿Get out! Get out! ﻿Give me back the ring, it's mine! ﻿Is there a problem, bro? ﻿Udi is in trouble. ﻿Come. ﻿Bechor, am I still a virgin? ﻿Orc's. ﻿All rise! ﻿What is this? ﻿A Yemeni Affairs Court. ﻿Yemenis always fight about inheritance, hogging the civil courts, ﻿so they created their own. ﻿Your honor, ﻿an hour ago, the accused party ﻿entered a Yemeni synagogue and caused total chaos. ﻿On one of them, your honor, this guy... ﻿we found these weapons. ﻿Exhibit A and B. ﻿To make things even worse, the accused ﻿invaded the women's section, ﻿shot arrows, and hit Mrs. Yona Gamliel. ﻿Exhibit C. ﻿Your honor, ﻿I've been dreaming about a husband since childhood. ﻿He could be short, tall, handsome or ugly, ﻿rich or not so rich, ﻿as long as he's Yemeni. ﻿Then this guy showed with a ring, ﻿so I said "yes", even though he's European. ﻿But, your honor, this is not how Cupid looks or his arrow. ﻿Your honor, I have pondered over this matter, and concluded ﻿that a death penalty would be too light a punishment. ﻿I therefore request, your honor, that you rule harshly and sentence the accused to... ﻿A fine. ﻿Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! ﻿What? ﻿I understand what you're saying. ﻿For 30 years he's been waiting for you to build him a proper courthouse. ﻿How do you know ancient Yemeni? - I speak Elvish. ﻿You never even got him a hammer. ﻿He thinks this is traditional Yemeni clothing. ﻿You're all free! ﻿Goodbye, pal! ﻿Drop by for a visit! ﻿Where's Bunji? ﻿Where's the van? ﻿Where's Shadowfax? ﻿Isn't the van more important? - It was a stolen van anyhow. ﻿Hey, kid! ﻿Have you seen a donkey? ﻿Here's a "khat-candy". ﻿Where is the khat? - You add it. ﻿Try the Bedouin tribe down there. - You're the best. ﻿Bunji! ﻿Bunji! ﻿Bunji! ﻿Bunji! ﻿Shadowfax is somewhere nearby! ﻿Huh? ﻿Hello, hello, hello and welcome. Hello, hello. ﻿Welcome. - Hello, I'm Bechor. ﻿I'm Abu Daud. Come in... - No, thanks. ﻿Say, have you seen my donkey Bunji? - I swear I haven't seen any donkey. ﻿Won't you come in, have some good coffee, some baklava? ﻿No, thanks, I'm... I'm looking for the donkey. ﻿Come in, come in... ﻿Bunji! ﻿Get off of him! ﻿Thank you, fatso, for finding my donkey. ﻿He's yours? - Bring him here, please. ﻿You did a great job looking after my donkey. ﻿This is a very dangerous area, full of Bedouins. ﻿Pay up. ﻿I'm broke. ﻿Give me a break, Abu Daud... ﻿Isn't that a pity? It's a good-looking donkey. ﻿Thank you, thank you. ﻿Can we get out of here? ﻿How will you leave without the van? ﻿He just paid you. - Sorry, doll-face, ﻿we don't make a habit of negotiating with women. Sorry. ﻿Take it, it's first hand, from a Bedouin. ﻿Give me the wristwatch. ﻿The wristwatch? - Come on... ﻿I got it from my dad before he passed away. ﻿I'm sorry, I... ﻿You really moved me, I mean it. ﻿Thank you. - I'm truly sorry... ﻿now, give me the watch. ﻿But... ﻿Come on. ﻿Come on. ﻿Thank you, thank you. ﻿Won't you come inside? ﻿Come on in. Please, come inside. ﻿Come inside. ﻿Say, Abu Daud, were you always Abu Daud? ﻿Of course, since birth. - And you have a son named Daud? ﻿Yes, coincidently. ﻿How did they know you would call him that, if your name was always Abu Daud? ﻿I don't know... ﻿Are you here to drive me crazy? ﻿We Bedouins don't think of the past, we only think ahead. ﻿What if you had a daughter? ﻿Fatso, you think I don't have daughters? ﻿Aliya! ﻿Arwenush! ﻿You have a pretty daughter. - Thank you. ﻿Blue-eyed. - I did my share in Russia too. ﻿How's it going, Fatmanova? ﻿Hello, daughter. Take off the burka. ﻿Say, Abu Daud, ﻿Is your daughter single? - Why? Have someone in mind? ﻿Actually, I do. ﻿Fatso? ﻿The fatso would be her groom... ﻿You naughty... ﻿Get real! ﻿You know what? I'll trade you: ﻿I'll give you Aliya ﻿in return for doll-face. ﻿Excuse me?! ﻿It's not a big deal. ﻿When I get enough mileage out of one wife, I get a newer model. ﻿That's why I have seven wives. - There are nine over there. ﻿Nine, you're right. I remembered only seven. ﻿Do I get doll-face? ﻿Well... ﻿Look, pal, no doll-face, no Aliya. ﻿Abu Daud, don't underestimate him. ﻿He just got a huge inheritance. ﻿He's a millionaire, he's got tons of money. ﻿Really? ﻿Praise God! Praise God! God willed it! ﻿Aliya, my daughter, you got a fine man here. ﻿No, Father, I ask of you... ﻿There's nothing to argue about, I'm the one who decide here. ﻿Father, please, he's a blowfish! ﻿Show me one girl who was with him, one girlfriend! ﻿Just one! - Enough! ﻿She says she wants to see just one girl who was ever his girlfriend. ﻿I was once his girlfriend. ﻿See that? ﻿No! -Yes! -No! - Aliya, hold on a minute! ﻿Come here, Aliya! ﻿Come back... Aliya! ﻿How much do you want for the ring? ﻿Huh?! ﻿You heard me. ﻿I'm sorry for my daughter's behavior. ﻿I'm truly sorry. ﻿Who are you? I don't remember you. ﻿Could you take your burka off so I can see your face? ﻿understand me? ﻿Take it off so I can see your face, come on, swetee. ﻿Take it off. ﻿God have mercy... Put it back on. ﻿You pick the 8th wife for her character... ﻿And who are you? ﻿Take it off. ﻿Oh, man, what a hotty! ﻿Nice to meet you, nice to meet you. ﻿Dear team, you represent the "Maccabi Tel Aviv" basketball club ﻿everywhere, every hour. ﻿Please keep a clean and tidy appearance. ﻿I'll know this evening. - Know what? ﻿Who the finalists are. ﻿"Maccabi Tel Aviv" and "Ha'Poel Jerusalem". ﻿I'm talking about the beauty pageant. "Eurovision hits" ﻿What's that? ﻿I didn't know straights listened to that. ﻿I thought you only liked Middle Eastern music. ﻿Yeah... some girl left it here. ﻿Bunji! ﻿Bunji! ﻿Bunji, what is it? ﻿Bunji... ﻿My Bunji... ﻿Look at me, Bunji. ﻿Something's wrong with him. ﻿He ate my food. ﻿I told you not to feed it to him! - I didn't, he took it on his own. ﻿But you gave him the munchies! ﻿It's not my fault he ate the wrapping. - What?! ﻿Bunji... ﻿My Bunji... ﻿Don't touch him! ﻿Killing him wasn't enough, now you're trying to kill me too? ﻿15 years ago today, ﻿Hapoel Tel-Aviv's basketball stadium Ussishkin was finally demolished. ﻿This is a day of celebration. ﻿Sorry. ﻿All in good time, Nachman. ﻿He will give us the ring. ﻿Every minute with you is costing me money. ﻿Now you're charging me by the hour? ﻿That's always been the custom. ﻿I provided the car, you pay for the gas. ﻿At least 50-50! ﻿You're screwing me, Riddler! ﻿You're middle-class, you're used to it. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Raphaela? ﻿I wasn't accepted to the beauty pageant. ﻿I didn't even make it to the 16 finalists. ﻿"And then Gollum bit Frodo ,, and took the ring. ﻿"Frodo yelled: ﻿"Ouch, ouch! ﻿"And then he fell "into the volcano". ﻿How much do you want for stealing the ring? ﻿Fuck you! ﻿I knew he couldn't be trusted. ﻿Bunji... ﻿I really loved you, Bunji. ﻿I know you did. ﻿What a waste... ﻿Letting an ass like that sit on the bench. ﻿Stop it, Bechor. ﻿I can't. It'll kill my career. ﻿You'll kill my career. - What? ﻿Have you ever seen a gay gangster? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿Only God can see us. ﻿1s my wife's genes. ﻿He didn't get it from me. ﻿And with a Middle Easterner, no less... ﻿Stop it, Bechor, I'm engaged. ﻿So? ﻿I do girls too, don't I? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿With all the girls "rear entry". ﻿What? ﻿Do you ever think back to when we were 12? ﻿I was whiney back then too. ﻿Yeah, ﻿but not over stuff like being a beauty queen. ﻿I have an answer, you know. ﻿To what? ﻿You once asked me how come Frodo never got married. ﻿I did. ﻿It's because he felt close only to one person. ﻿To who? ﻿To Gollum. ﻿Gollum was once a hobbit too. ﻿I wrote a continuation to the story. ﻿What did you write? ﻿That Gollum survived and changed. ﻿That he he returned to the village ﻿and became really close with Frodo. ﻿I had three years to think about it. ﻿Udi, no. ﻿Why not? ﻿You love me. You're just scared that the ring will prove it. ﻿I don't want to hurt you. ﻿Like you didn't want to hurt me on my birthday? ﻿What happened? ﻿What's with you? ﻿Lets ﻿Where to? ﻿We've tried everything, what else is there? ﻿I know just the place. ﻿A place where no one will turn me down. ﻿- Rehabilitation Center - ﻿Hi. ﻿Come here. ﻿Who shot this? ﻿Your dad and his asshole friend. ﻿What?!
