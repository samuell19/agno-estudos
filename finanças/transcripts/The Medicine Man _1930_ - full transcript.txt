Buddy, Buddy, Buddy. Oh, I must have been dreaming. Hurry up, before Pa comes. He won't let us stop and look at half this stuff. Remember last time some of the candy boxes were broken? Gee, I hope they're busted this time. Of course, it's bad for Pa's profits, but you can't help liking candy. Oh, Buddy, look. I could make you the nicest sweater out of this. Sure, but let's find a busted box of candy. Gee, Buddy, I wish we had a Victrola. I just love music. Sure, but I love candy better. Gosh, I hope the box is broken. Look, Buddy. Look. Isn't it beautiful? Oh, I thought you found something to eat. I got it. I got it. Aw, it ain't busted. I'm sorry. It's busted now, all right. Oh, you shouldn't. Pa would be awful mad. Aw, he's always mad. Here he comes now. Put it away, quick, and pick up those records. Watch where you're going. Who was playing that phonograph? I was. Well, don't do it again. You know better. My customers don't want used goods. If I catch you doing it again, I'll give you both a good licking. Why don't you watch your feet? You slip all the time, huh? My shoe, it's caught. Sliding on the again, huh? No, he wasn't, Father. He's worn those for over a year. And besides-- , you go back to your work and unpack that case. You clean this mess up here. I'm going out now. And don't you waste time while I'm gone, or I'll lick you when I get back. Keep your hands off that horn. The next time, I will beat you good. Sit down. Good morning, Mr. Scholtz. Good morning, I want a sack of sugar, Mamie. That's a nice dress, ain't it? You keep your hands off me, Peter Scholtz. Oh, I didn't mean no harm. I like you, Mamie. That's all. I don't want you to like me. Is there anything else besides sugar? Uh, I was going to ask you if I couldn't come to visit you tonight for a while. Well, you can't, tonight or any other night. What do you want? Come on, Pa. There's a parade coming. Maybe, uh, later? Hurry, Pa. Maybe later I think of something else I need, huh? Get in there. But, Dad, we want to stay and see the parade. Huh? We want to see the parade. I'll tell you all about the parade when we get home. Sit down. I don't like that fellow. I don't know anybody who does, Gus, except my father. Hey, Mamie, look it. Come here, quick. Gosh, I bet that's a really. Perhaps Dr. Harvey's Medicine would help my gallstone. You can't tell Harvey. He's. And now, my friends, right here tonight you will see that has ever visited your fair city. The New York representative critics have proclaimed this show to be the greatest aggregation of merry-making mirth provokers since Shakespeare was barred from Avon. You will see Martin and Webb, those outstanding and incomparable artists, direct from a three-years tour of the foremost vaudeville theaters. I can say unquestionably and without fear of contradiction that this is the most sensational act that has ever been presented on any stage. You will see those happy, hilarious, hip-swinging hula dancers, direct from the shores of languorous Hawaii, and that big Indian Chief, Paw Paw, and thrilling dances of his forefathers, and other attractions too numerous to mention. And now, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no admission into the camp. Our sole aim is to entertain you. And remember, folks, the show starts promptly at 8 o'clock, so be there, 8 o'clock sharp, and see this great show. Remember, folks, it's free, absolutely free. Give me two in the front row, please. Two what? I don't understand you. I beg your pardon. I took one look at you and thought I was at the Folly. Anyone ever tell you you were pretty? Uh, no, sir. Well, there's a great opening in this town for an optician. I'll bet you tell that to all the girls. No, I don't. I don't know all the girls. Is there anything I can sell you? Yes, give me a box of candy. How's this? Well, haven't you got a larger box? Oh, yes, there's a larger one, but it's more expensive. Now, don't worry about the expense. This is for a very dear friend of mine. Will this do? That's all right. Have you got a little card, you know, the kind that you put on a gift box? Oh, yes. Will you write something for me? My fingers are a little sore. I've been sewing all day. What shall I write? To the sweetest little girl I have ever met. Is this for your sweetheart? Yes. There you are. There you are. Oh, for me? Mm-hmm. Oh, I-- I shouldn't really take this, but it's awfully sweet of you, Mister? Dr. Harvey, Dr. John H. Harvey. Thank you, Dr. Harvey. Now, young lady, as a physician, I wish to make several recommendations to you. My advice for you, young lady, plenty of night air and long walks in the moonlight. Oh, but I'd be afraid in the moonlight all alone. Ah, but the ethics of my profession provide that the physician never leaves a patient's side when his services are required. Therefore, I'll meet you tonight after the show and give you your first treatment, and it'll be some treatment. How do you know I'm going to the show? Your doctor has ordered it. But my father wouldn't let me if I asked him, and he'd fly into a terrible rage if I went without asking him. Oh, well, that's easy. Ask him tomorrow morning when we get back. Will this pay for the candy? Mm-hmm. Come on, Pa. Why don't you go on with your work? I'll teach you to leave the store and waste your time when I'm gone. Go on. Well, did you ever try kicking him in the face? Is there something that you want here? Why, yes. Well, why don't you get it? I will, later on. Yeah, you, go on. Go back to your work, and don't waste so much time. And if you disobey me again, I'll make you sorry for it. Gee, Mamie, did you see that big Indian chief? Oh, he looks wonderful. Look. He bought this and gave it to me. Who, the Indian? Of course not, Dr. Harvey. Oh, boy. Oh, hello, Doc, how are ya? Hello, Doc. Say, Doc, this town looks like it ought to be great pickings. Now, wait a minute, fellas, none of that fast stuff here. Remember the trouble we had last time? I had to spend half of my profit getting you out of the hoosegow. Yeah, well, how about the money that I spent getting rid of that sweet chambermaid of yours? What about her? Please, mister, youse can tell me where I can find the medicine show? I then look for Dr. Harvey. Medicine show is straight down the street. You can't miss it. But I missed that feller one, two, three, five times before I come here. Well, now, wait a minute. What's the use of arguing? All I want to know is this. Did you finally get rid of her? Yes, I got rid of her. I certainly did, Doc. She's gone for good. Good, now remind me Saturday night to give each of you a punch in the nose. Tennyson, why is it you're always taking credit for everything-- I don't want credit for anything. I just want to be-- -Listen. Listen. While you fellas decide who gets the credit, I'm going across the street and have a cup of java. You can't miss it. Thank you. Swedish lady. Uh-huh. I hope we hit a big town pretty soon. I'm getting sick and tired of these birds. I'm telling you that. You know the last show-- Hello. Hilda. And up jumped the devil. Well, what are you doing here? I come Dr. Harvey. Oh, you did, eh? Hilda, for Go-- you don't mean to stand there and tell me that you didn't see Dr. Harvey back in Mitchellville. Well, I come here to see him. Oh, this is terr-- this is awful. Hilda, listen. Dr. Harvey is waiting for you back in Mitchellville. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Hilda. There's poor Dr. Harvey waiting for you, and here you've run out and deserted him like this. Hilda, I tell you what you better. You have gotta get on the train and go right back to Mitchellville. Oh, isn't it terrible? Now, there is Dr. Harvey, all alone. It's probably breaking his heart. Hilda, for good-- haven't you got-- I mean, haven't you any feelings at all? But I got no money. I just spent it all to come here. Ah, money. I'll tell you what I'll do. Here, here's some money. Get on the train and-- and go back to Mitchellville. But I got no money for a hotel bill. Oh, OK, here. Hilda, here, there's money for a hotel. Now, go, Hilda. I need change to tip the porter. Well, can't you break a bill? Here, never mind. Listen. Here, there's a quarter for the porter. Go and tip-- look. Look, here's an extra dime for the bellboy. Now, will you go? Go on, will ya? Thank you. I shall hurry now to catch the train. -Yeah. Goodbye. Goodbye, and try and get hit with an automobile, Hilda. Oh, I forgot to give her a penny to buy a drinking cup. Yeah. You know, I'm-- Well, I just got rid of that sweet dame of yours again. No, no. Yeah, I noticed that. No, he means I got rid of that sweet dame. I got-- -Hey, wait a minute now. What do you mean, you got rid of her? Well, who did get rid of her? What's the difference? All right, fellas, all right, thank both of you very much. Why don't you settle this with boxing gloves? Well, did you got it? Yeah, I've got it har. Pa. What? Oh, uh, see how nice we cleaned up the store? Well? Oh, Pa, would you let us go to the medicine show? No, we can't afford it. But it doesn't cost anything. It's free. Oh, free, huh? Oh, well, all right, but remember. Be back in one hour. Here, here. Wait. And don't have nothing to do with those no-good show people. Here. Mamie, Mamie. Oh, Mamie. Yes, Pa? Who broke these records? I did. You take your clothes off and go right straight to bed. Do you hear me? Mr. Goltz. Eh? If you let Buddy go to the show, I'll pay for the record. Where did you get money, huh? Well, cash, I ain't got, but you could take it out of my pay. You mind your own business. Go on. Listen, Buddy. You can take off your shoes and slip out the back way. But be sure and be back from the show before Pa comes upstairs. Gee, you're a swell sister. Hurry, now, and don't let Pa hear you. And now, folks, the show is about to start, the finest entertainment you have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. There are a lot of good seats inside, but you'll have to hurry. You can't see the show out here. Hurry, hurry, hurry, folks. If you want to hear the minstrel man sing, if you want to see the girls dance, you've got to go inside. They can't dance out here. It's cold, and besides, the Sheriff is moody. Now, hurry up. Hurry up, folks. Right inside. Maybe we can get the chief, Chief Paw Paw, to talk to us. And you should see his mohawk. What a gal, and last but not least, folks, the fire eater. Watch him eat fire. And how, he he eats it, and he's hungry, folks. He hasn't had a thing to eat in two days, not a thing. Would you like to see our show? Oh, yes, sir. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take you in myself and see that you get a nice front seat. Oh, thank you, sir. You're a pretty little girl, too. Are you here alone? Oh, no, sir, my father is here with me. Oh, your father is here with you? Step right in, folks, and see the show. But, mister. Now, you're going to be-- please, please. Now, you're going to be late, folks. But, mister, you said you'd get me-- Now, go right in yourself. You'll find plenty of empty seats. Walk right in. Hello, Goltz. Wie geht's, Peter? Oh, I-- I butchered today, so I brought you some nice, fresh pigs' feet. Do you know, uh, pigs' feet are pretty scarce these days. Uh, I could have gotten $0.40 for them. Say, uh, is Mamie around? Uh, now I know why you're here and why I get pigs' feet. Well, now that I'm here, I would like to visit with her for a while. So you're kind of sweet on her, huh? Oh, I like her, all right. You know, it has been awful lonesome since the old lady died, and then again my kids ought to have a woman around. So I was thinking. Maybe you would like for me and Mamie to get married, huh? Well, Peter, I don't know of anybody that would make a better husband for her. You're a good, steady fella, and you've got a fine farm, huh? But right now, I can't spare her. I need her here in the store. Maybe after a while, when Buddy is big enough to do all the work, I'd be glad that you should marry her. That Peter Scholtz is downstairs. You'd better get out quick. He wants to visit with you. You stay here. I go see what Mamie is doing. Yeah, what's the matter? Why are you in bed, huh? Peter Scholtz is downstairs and wants to visit with you. I've got a headache, Pa. What from? I don't know. I guess I'm just tired. Oh, you're always tired, and I don't know why. Here, you see that you're not too tired when it's time to get up in the morning. All right, Pa. Yeah. Well, uh, where is Mamie? She wasn't feeling good, and she's gone to bed. After I came all the way in just to see her? I am sorry I wasted all this gasoline. Gute Nacht, Peter. , Peter. You'll break your arm with that full car. Uh, I am Peter. , huh? Oh, Peter, there you are. There you go. Gute Nacht, Peter. Auf Wiedersehen. Hey, Mamie. Hey, Mamie. Mamie. Hello, Buddy. So Dr. Harvey's gave me a job. If I sell $12 of medicine, I'll get $0.60. Look at the swell shirt he gave me. Oh, that's wonderful. Thanks, you come take my seat. I gotta go to work. Right here. Thanks, Buddy. Now, friends, we're going to sing you a song, a cute and sweet little ditty. I wrote some music in the country. And I wrote the words in the city. Now, we have a cat down at our house. It's small as a ball of yarn, and when the little kittens were born, they all had sweaters on. I tried to get my wife to ride a horse, just to reduce her weight. The horse lost 40 pounds, and the wife gained 98. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I-- my error, boys. Pardon me. Now, we could stand here, hour by hour, and sing this little song. But the show has two more hours to go, so we better run along. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to address you folks on a subject that is of most vital interest to each and every one of you. And that subject, my good friends, is health. To those of you who have suffered from ills and aches, I come to you with the glad tidings that there is hope. Now, the science of anatomy, friends, is divided into two groups-- physiology and physic, though perhaps many of you have never taken physiology. I hold before you tonight, John H. Harvey's Pawnee Tonic and Blood Purifier, at $1 a bottle. What if I were to tell you folks that men have been brought into my presence with both legs amputated, and after one teaspoonful of this liquid, skated home? You'd say I was lying, now, wouldn't you? It can't be done. Of course, it can't. Mussolini couldn't do it. But I don't claim this. No matter what your ailment, my friend, no matter how long you have suffered or how hopeless the case may be, Dr. Harvey's Pawnee Tonic and Blood Purifier, at $1 a bottle, will restore you to perfect health. Now, the secret formula of this world-renowned remedy was handed down from the forefathers of Chief Homantash, the greatest chief of all the Pawnee. Thank you. Now, friends, I have a testimonial here, one of the many I receive every day from a grateful public. "Dear Sir, if you do not pay for your overcoat by the 10th of this mon--" sorry, folks. That's the wrong letter, but I know I have it. I must have it right here in this pocket. Here we are, right here. "Dear Dr. Harvey, for weeks, my husband has been violently insane and imagined he was Louis the 16th. After taking two bottles of your tonic, he has greatly improved and now thinks he is only Louis the 14th." And now, my friends, the price of this medicine is the small and insignificant sum of $1. I do not claim, folks, that it will cure dandruff, falling arches, run-down heels, or carburetor trouble, no, but I do say this. It is a positive remedy for the stomach, kidney, liver, cuts, burns, and bruises, pains in the small of the back, lumbago, rheumatism, ailments of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat and all joints with it. And now, friends, my agents will pass among you. Come on, boys. You're up. All right, boys. Hair on your head and corns on your bunions. How do you do, Colonel? How about a bottle? Well, I don't think so. Colonel? Remember. I do, indeedy. This is double strength. Well, what do you say? I'll take one. Here's another gentleman who takes another bottle, another bottle sold. $1, Colonel. $1, well, there's a $20 bill. $20 bill, all right, $1 for the medicine, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, and $10, or $20, I thank you, Colonel. Now, folks, if there's anybody else who would like to buy a bottle-- Hey, come back here. You made a mistake. A mistake, Colonel? There's only $15 there. A mistake? Well, a mistake, sure. All right, Colonel, just let me see your money. You'll count it over again. I wouldn't cheat you for the world. $1 for the medicine, $2, $3, $4, and $2 is $6. $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, uh-- oh, how do you do? Pardon me, who's the young lady? Why, that's my daughter. Your daughter? A very pretty girl, takes after the father. How old is she, Colonel? Well, she's 18 now. 18? $18 and $2 are $20. I thank you, Colonel. Good day, my mistake. It makes the old, young, folks, and it makes the, uh-- How's the wife, Sheriff? Oh, she's just fine, Ted. I have one bottle left, folks. Now that perfect health has been put within the reach of all, I am going to disclose to every lady my audience the priceless secret of perpetual charm. Folks, right here in my hand I have the sesame to everlasting youth and beauty, Dr. John H. Harvey's, Bridal Blush. Now, I'm not going to take up any of your time making extravagant claims for this preparation. I merely wish the privilege of proving to you that Dr. John H. Harvey's Bridal Blush can enhance the beauty of the fairest handiwork of Mother Nature. Now, I'm going to ask some young lady to come out on stage so that I may offer a practical demonstration of the miracles wrought by Dr. John H. Harvey's Bridal Blush. Now, which young lady will assist me? I think I'll go. Thank you, girls, but this young lady has kindly consented to come up on the platform and assist me. Now, honey, don't worry. Don't worry at all. You're among friends. I think it's a fake. So do I. Come on. I'm nervous up here on the stage. There you are, folks, the young lady says that she got her beauty from the self-same preparation, procured from my main office in Toledo. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, indeed, she says. Nothing in the world compares to Dr. Harvey's Bridal Blush. Soap and water is all I ever use. Me, too, and look at my complexion. A little music, Chief. I'll have you fixed up in a minute. How about going out in an automobile ride tonight, Mamie? Oh, I'd love to, but I couldn't. Why not? Well, you see, I came over here without my father's permission, and I have to get back home. Oh, that's too bad. Now, watch me closely, folks. Hattie, I feel it is my duty to go and tell Mr. Goltz what a shameful spectacle his daughter is making. You're right, absolutely right. Snuck out to see the show, eh? No, to see you. You wouldn't kid me now, would you? Do you like me, Mamie? Oh, yes. I think you're wonderful. Do you hear that, folks? The young lady says that my beauty system is absolutely wonderful. How about tomorrow night? Yes, I think I can. It's a date, then, eh, beautiful? I don't know how you ever had the courage to go up there. Oh, well, I didn't really want to go up on the-- Well, you-- you're OK. You had a headache and had to go to bed. Now, go home, you crazy Jezebel and take that filth off your face. Go on. Go home. Well, I only did my duty as I saw it. You certainly did. Get out here. Oh, oh, Papa, please, don't. I'll teach you to lie. I didn't do anything. Please, I didn't do anything. I promise I didn't do anything. You, go on upstairs. You hear me? And I'm going out and fix those no-good show people. Don't cry, Mamie. Well, did he hurt you much, Mamie? Oh, I'll be all right. Dr. Harvey's Medicine, folks. Here, here. I have done you a lot of favors. Well, now, I'd like to run 'em out of town, but I gotta have a reason. Well, uh, can't you trump up something? Madam, there's your change, and there's your bottle. Call again to find out-- I'm going over to the restaurant and get something to-- shh. I'll watch 'em. And if I get anything on 'em, then I won't run 'em out of town. I'll put 'em in jail. Good. Hello, baby. Hello. Did the old buzzard suspect anything? You mean Pa? Oh, no, I waited till I heard him snoring. Well, I hope he keeps it up. Oh, it was nice of you to send me the, uh, stockings. Did you wear 'em? Uh, oh, yes. Not bad, not bad at all, they're awfully nice. Oh, and thank you very much for the other thing. I mean, the, uh, pretty. Pretty? That's not what I asked for when I bought 'em. Did you wear those, too? Oh, I think we'd better drive away from here. Somebody might see us and tell my father. OK, honey, now which road has the heaviest traffic? Why, the main street, of course. Great, we'll take this one. Now, gentlemen, the hour is getting late. We haven't got much more time to stay here. Now, I want you to keep your mind on the game and nothing else. I'm gonna show you how to win some money. I'll show you how the trick's done. Now, first, I'll show to you. Now, there's the ace. Now, all you do is keep your mind on the ace. You understand that, don't you? Now, here we are. Now, just watch the little ace. Now, then, which is the ace, sir? Take your time. You might guess it. You think that's it, do you? And, really, you'd bet on that, too, wouldn't you? How much would you bet? Oh, $25. $25. Well, now, let's see if you'd win. That isn't it, is it? That isn't it, so consequently that must be it. Now, there you are. Do you see how easy it is? Now, had you had your money up, you'd have one that time, wouldn't you? Now, I'm gonna show it to this gentleman here. Yeah, I'll show it to you if you don't mind, mister-- oh, pardon me. What is your name? Scruggs. Mr. Scruggs. And your name? Perkins. Perkins, shake hands with Mr. Scruggs, Mr. Perkins. Now, Mr. Suds, I'm gonna show it to you. There's the ace. You all see it, gentlemen, the little ace. Now, then, which one do you think it is, Mr. Spuds? Scruggs. Oh, Scruggs. Well, we all make mistakes. That's the reason we put, uh, rubbers on lead pencils. Now, take your time, and, uh, which one is it? He may guess it. You did. This one. You think that's it? And you would bet, of course, being a sporting man. Yes. How Much would you bet? $50. Is that so? Well, now, let's see if he'd win. That isn't it. That isn't it, so that must be it. Now, there you are, gentlemen. You see, gentlemen? I'm not cheating. You can win, can't you? Now, we'll try it once more. But this time, gentlemen, if you have any money to put down, let's make it a good bet. Now, remember, gentlemen, you've got as much chance as I have. Now, here we go, gentlemen. Remember, watch the ace. Shh, just a minute, gentlemen. There's the Sheriff, I think. He wanted to come in here and play, and I wouldn't let him. Just a minute. Hey, shall we look at 'em? Sure. Yeah, go ahead. Look, there it is. That's the ace. We'll bend this corner up. OK. Shh, gentlemen, I was right. It was the Sheriff, and I wouldn't let him come in. Now, I'm afraid this will have to be the last game. You see? Now, remember, gentlemen, the ace is the thing. And don't forget it, gentlemen, the ace. The ace is the thing. Now, here we are. Remember, get your money down because this is the last time tonight you'll be able to bet. Now, try and win all you can from me, gentlemen. Now, watch it. Now, watch it, and watch it very clo-- oh, I beg your pardon. I'm a little bit nervous on account of the Sheriff. Now, remember, gentlemen, here is the ace. Now, watch the ace. Now, watch it, gentlemen. There it is. There we are, gentlemen. Now, which one is the ace? -It's that one. Hurry up. You think it is, eh? All right, put your money down. All right, have you put your money down? All right, hurry up, gentlemen. Remember, there will be no more tonight. Are you finished, gentlemen? Well, let's see. There's the ace, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but there's where you lose. See, there's the chance you take. Now, gentlemen, remember, that is the way out. I'll see you tomorrow night. Goodnight, gentlemen, and thanks for your time. I I could have sworn it was that one. Yeah, you must have bet the wrong one. Aw. Gee, it's nice out here, isn't it? It's beautiful. Look. Look. Oh. Land sakes. What is it? What is it? It's Mamie Goltz, as sure as I'm alive. And that corn doctor. Shh. That terrible-- can't we drive up a little bit closer? I should say not. I'm going home. Oh, I know you don't mean all the things you say to me, but I like to hear them just the same. Don't mean them? Of course, not, every week you are in a different town and see different girls. You know you do. But, honey, you're different. No, I'm not, but I don't care. I know you'll go away and forget all about me because I'm just another girl. But I won't forget about you. I'll always remember you. And even if I have to marry old Peter Scholtz, I'll always look back on tonight and say, I was never so happy in my life. You're not angry, are you? I'm not angry, honey. Then what's the matter? We better get back to town. Oh, please, don't go yet. You're leaving town tomorrow, and all I'll have after you're gone is just the remembrance of tonight. And I'll remember it, too, sweetie, but we better get back. Why? Because you're the sweetest little girl I've ever met. Gus. Gus. Here, did you open this door? No. No? Morning, Pa. Well, who opened that door after I locked it last night, huh? Why, I-- Well? Well? Well? I opened it. Oh, you did, eh? What for? I just went out to the medicine show. Hmm, what time did you get back? 10 o'clock. What? Well, I didn't get in until after 11:00, myself. What about that, huh? I-- I went out again. What? After 11 o'clock, you go out again, huh? Well, you come with me. I'll teach you not to leave this house when I say you just stay in here. Go out at 11 o'clock, will you? Well, I've got you. There. Let this be a lesson for you to never leave this place. Don't. Don't. Keep crying. Pa, Pa, Buddy didn't do anything? No, he sneaked off last night, and he leave that door open. Oh, it wasn't Buddy who was out last night. It was I. What? You? Where did you go? I went out for a walk. Yeah, who with? Nobody, I went by myself. Don't lie to me. Who were you with? I tell you. I was by myself. I'll make you tell me the truth. And if you don't, it'll Don't. Don't you strike her again, Mr. Goltz. You understand that? I kill you. Now, here, you let this-- Mr. Goltz, oh, Mr. Goltz? Take him back there. Go on. Good morning, Ms. Wilson. Nice morning, huh? Yes, it is. Is there something you want, huh? Listen, Goltz. I've come to perform a most unpleasant duty. Yes. But sometimes, the most unpleasant things are the best for us in the long run. Well, what is it? And you know, we can't always see the wisdom of the lord's work. Yeah, yeah, I know. But what's it about? It's about Mamie. About my Mamie? Well, what about her? She was out last night with that medicine doctor. What? At Western Slate, all alone, late at night. I thought you'd want to be told because everybody else in town knows. Yeah, well, if everybody knows, you told them to. Oh. Get out. Get out. I never was so insulted in all my life. I want rural 98W. Hello. This is Emmond Goltz speaking. Hello, Mr. Goltz. So Peter, my Mamie's been talking about you. Huh, Mamie? Mamie was asking about me? Yeah, und, uh, you want to marry her, huh? Sure, sure, I would like to. Well, I've been thinking about it, too, Peter. Und there's no use of putting it off. Today is as good as any day, huh? Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, sure. I wanted to butcher today, but I can do that tomorrow. And Mamie can learn it, too. And I-- I'll be right in town. No, no, don't bother. Uh, I'll tank the car up and come right out and get you. Gee, Mamie, what are you gonna do? Give me a cigarette, will you? Yeah, hey, you know something? What? I wish we were out of this dump. So do I. I'm beginning to feel nervous. You know, I am afraid that Swede dame is gonna give trouble to us before we get out of town. Give me a light. If she doesn't, here comes one that will. Uh-oh. Can you tell me where Dr. Harvey is? Dr. Harvey, why, didn't you see him this morning? No. Well, he said he was gonna say goodbye to you. Goodbye? Yeah. Yeah, sure. He left town this morning. Yeah, you see, um, he went to Mitchellville. To Mi-- no, no, not Mitchellville. No? No, he don't mean Mitchellville. He means, um-- well, I don't know the name of the town. But anyhow, he's gone. Yeah, you. Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, he'll be back. Oh, nay, oh, oh, nay. Oh, no, no, no, I mean, he won't be back. He's gone for good. Hello, honey. I was just thinking about you. Oh, Dr. Harvey, Buddy and I are so unhappy. Won't you take us away with you? Come on inside, sweet, and tell me all about it. All right, now, honey, tell me. What's the trouble? It's Pa. He's beat us all our lives until we just can't stand it any longer. What do you want to be lying to that little girl for? Me lying? No, I guess I was lying. What are you talking about? You started to do all the-- oh, listen. Will you lay off of me and leave me alone? Well, now, don't you worry your little head about it any longer. You mean? I mean that you and I are going away from here. And take Buddy with us? And take Buddy with us. Oh, I can't tell you how happy I am. Don't try. Just run along home. Pack your things. Bring buddy back. And as soon as you come back, we'll go. Run along, honey, and get right back. I won't keep you waiting. We'll be back in no time. I'll tell you. Them circus fellas is all slickers. That fella wasn't on the level. He did me for $50, and the wife's raising Cain. I am for having them arrested. So am I. He's a crook, all right. Well, of course you fellers have no business gambling. But if you want to swear out a warrant-- -I'll swear out a warrant. -Me, too. Me, too. So will I. All right, then, if you'll come with me, we'll swear out a warrant. And I'll lock 'em up. Go on. Now, you're talking. I hear said a mouthful. Hey, you guys, you better beat it fast. Why? What's the matter, kid? My pop went with the rest of the guys to get a, uh, one of those things to have you arrested with. What's that you're saying, Barton? You're all going to be arrested. What have you fellas been pulling now? Well, Doc, we haven't done anything. We just, uh-- Oh, we just had a little Monte game last night. That's all, Doc. Yeah, well, I told you to lay off of that stuff here, didn't I? Well, we had to get a little dough, didn't we? And besides, you said we'd be out of this town by daylight, now, didn't you? Yeah, that's right. Where did you say they went, son? They went to get something to arrest someone with. A warrant? Yeah, that's it, but you guys better beat it. Well, what are you waiting for, the Sheriff? No. Come on, fellas. Get packed. Let's get out of here. Oh, yeah. Here we are, Peter. Yeah, here we are. Mannie, come here. Come here. Where do you think you are going, huh? I am going away with Dr. Harvey, and Buddy's going with us. Yeah, well, who said so? I did, and so did Dr. Harvey. Und you believed him, huh? Why, yes. Why shouldn't I? You come with me. I'll show you why. Come. There, you see that? That's the way he's gonna take you with him. You going to marry Peter Scholtz, a good, honest man. That's what you're going to do. Peter, you stay here and see that Mamie don't go nowhere. I'll go get the license and be right back. Yes, sir, Goltz, I'll do that. Go on inside. Go on. Oh, John. I brought the Justice of Peace, and we're going to be married right here and now. What? She is going to marry me. Now, quit kidding yourself, Adonis. Where'd you get that idea? Well, uh, her-- her father told me so. And I am not going to be by nobody. Where is her father now? Well, he is going to get the license, and me and Mamie are going to get married. Now, listen, Scholtz, why don't you bring her father back here, and we can settle this thing right away. Hmm, so you two could run away, huh, well I'm gone, huh? Why, don't be silly. Here is the Justice of Peace, a sworn officer of the law. Will you keep them here, huh? Sure, Scholtz. Now, don't you worry about a thing. I'll see there's no injustice done. Can I depend on it? Absolutely, run along. All right, then. OK, judge, do your stuff. Buddy and Gus will be witnesses. Sure we will, won't we, Gus? Sure. Oh, by the way, have you got a ring? Sure thing, judge, right here. That's good. Now, Miss, uh, Mamie Goltz and Mr. John H. Harvey, I'm about to join you in holy wedlock. Hurry, hurry. Come back. The doctor is here. He's right in your store. What? And he said he's going to marry Mamie. I told him Mamie is going to marry me, and he said, she ain't. So I come to get you. -Come quick. -Huh? We go. Now, under the laws of this state and in the sight of God I pronounce you man and wife. Come on. Let's get going before Pa comes. Thanks very much, judge, for your assistance. Now, really, you know, Mr. Harvey, I shouldn't take money for playing a trick on old Goltz. You know, that's pay enough for most any man. All right, judge. Goodbye, Gus. Be happy, Mamie. That's all I want. Come on. Let's get going. Mamie, we'll have to run along. So long, Gus. Goodbye, judge. So long and good luck to you. Goodbye and good luck to you. Oh, great, eh? You bet. Where's my daughter? Why, she just got married to a right nice young man. What? And if I am not mistaken, she just started on her honeymoon. Well, there ain't no man gonna run away with my daughter. Why-- Well, what? She's married to him now, and you're not going to stop him. Go on. Get out of my way. Buddy and Mamie are going to be happy. or get out of the way. Gus. Gus. I didn't do it. Yes, Gus, he always was a queer old chap, and I always knowed that he'd end up by killing himself. Hey, Sheriff, I want to prove there's nothing dishonest about this game. It just takes a little skill and cleverness, that's all. Now, now, Sheriff, now you just watch the ace. That's all you have to do. Now, keep your mind on the ace. Now, do you think you can find it? I certainly can. Well, where is it? Right there. And would you back your judgment, you know, up to a $10 bill on it? I certainly will. Well, put up your money. There you are. Now, let's see if you win. It isn't that one. It isn't that one, so it must be that one. The Sheriff wins $10. Now, there you are, Sheriff. You see, you'd all pick it out if you were as clever as him. Is there anything dishonest about this, Sheriff? Well, I don't see anything wrong about this game. I'd be willing to stay here and play it all night. Why, sure, you would. Come on. I'll go you again for $50. Sure. The Sheriff's gonna play $50 more. Yeah, I heard him. He likes this game, don't you? You bet I do. Yeah. Well, now, watch the ace, Sheriff. Now, where is it, Sheriff? There it is. How much have you got there? $50. $50. I want to be in on that. You sure know how to pick 'em, Sheriff. Well, that's the ace, gentlemen, so I guess I have to pay you all off. $1, $2, there's $20, $30, $40.
