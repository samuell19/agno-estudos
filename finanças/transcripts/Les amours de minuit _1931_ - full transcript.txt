Gaston Bouchard sentenced to 20 years in a penal colony has escaped from the courthouse yesterday by killing his guard - stop - Monitor all train stations, ports and front... - Can I sit here? - Yes, please do. - May I? - Please. Courthouse escapee The police are on his trail They let them escape from courthouses now! Did you read it? Just like in the movies. Isn't it? Yes, yes. I will arrive at 7:30 Wait for me at the station restaurant Jesus Christ! Ticket, please. Thank you, sir. - Ticket, please. - I haven't got one. What? No ticket? No, I had no time to buy one. But I can pay now. But... where did you get on? What? You don't know? I don't care. Next station, I'll report you. Come on. Don't be so mean. He wants to pay. You're funny. What about the rules? What do you do about it? The rules, the rules... Don't be over-zealous. There are honest people. Just look at him. Sure, but... you know... In theory... Well, just this once... Where are you going? Harbour station or city station? Harbour. To the port. You know... You've been lucky dealing with me. Zero, zero, zero equals zero. Four plus nine, thirteen. Plus seven, twenty. 200 francs. Thank you. And next time... Be careful, all right? If you'd been dealing with someone else, things would have been different. Since there are rules, one must respect them. What a jerk! - He'd put you off travelling. - Thanks for your help. Don't mention it. We have plenty of time. The ship is leaving at midnight. Will you travel on the Lafayette? Me, too. - We'll travel together, then. - You're going to America? Yes, this time, I'm going to America. I travel a lot, me. Is this your first crossing? Yes, this'll be the first time I'm crossing the ocean. - Afraid of being seasick? - I don't know. Here. Take two pills. A white one and a red. They'll mix in your stomach. Take them. Yes, yes... Take them. I always carry some with me. That's wonderful. I've never been sick. During my last crossing, the 4th, everybody was laid up, even the captain. Believe it or not, I was all by myself in the dinning room, fresh as a daisy. Description Size: thin General aspect: feline Characteristics: anchor tattooed on the left arm Have you memorised him? - Will you recognise him? - I sure will. I've known him for 5 years. He was beginning. And so was I. He shot a bartender. It was me who arrested him. But at the police HQ... He never talked. He's tough. He has worked his way up. Three murders, thrice absconded, the train robbery... And yesterday, the escape from the courthouse. To escape from the courthouse by strangling the guard, you have to be a man. He's not scared. And... Remember he's risking his life. Gaston Bouchard... I could arrest 10 like him. Yes. Well, start with this one. Are you ready, boys? The train is coming, there's no time to lose. You could arrest 10 like him? What a joke! It's hard to believe. Look, just this week, I've spent... 300,000 francs. Do you realise? Nice, Algiers, Monte Carlo, the Riviera... I'm home wherever I go. You're lucky. That's a life. Yes, the great life. The good life! The good life, yes. As silly as this may sound, I've never seen a big city. No? - Really? - Yes. - You're alone? - Yes. Don't you know anybody? - No one is expecting you in the city? - No, no one. My dear fellow, I understand. You'll need a guide. Trust me. With me, all the doors will open up for you. And tonight, to begin with, we'll go to... Tell me, women... You like that? Does it ring a bell? Of course! That's strange, you seem to be the sentimental type. You like blondes, don't you? Not just blondes. Brunettes or blondes, that's all the same with... You'll get them all. So, listen. Tonight... Look, let me take care of it. It's 7:00. The ship's leaving at midnight. At the departure, we'll be half-seas over. What? I mean we'll go to the nightclubs where everyone knows me. And you know what, I'll pay. - Hell, no! - Yes, old chap. Tonight, it's on me. You'll have all the time to catch up on the boat. I think we're arriving. - Is it the harbour? - No, the city. We've got time to freshen ourselves up. We'll start with a good dinner. For that I'll rely on you. You can trust me. We'll have a feast. - Shit! - What? I see some friends. Go to the station restaurant. We'll meet you there. Oh, sorry! Waiter! - Sir? - A coffee. Leave me alone! Leave me alone, I told you! Ah, look, sir. Look, it's walking. Did you see? It's walking well. Look. Look. Oh, pretty lady! Look how it's walking. Here, madam. - You don't want that? - You have something else? Oh, yes! It's all right. Here. - No, something else. - It's all right, sir. Here, look! That's good. - 4 francs. - No, no. It's all right! It's a gift. - 4 francs just for you. - No way. - 2 francs. - Nope. He's won by ripping me off. Here. Buy this for your lady. - She's not your lady? - No, she's not. It's all right! It's for you, madam. Here. It's all right! - No. - Yes, madam. - How much? - 5 francs. - Here. - Thanks a lot! Go away now. - It's yours. - No, it isn't. I bought it for you. I don't like birds. Good evening. Good evening. That's all you have to say? I... Kiss me. Kiss me! Don't make a fuss. We're being watched. Don't spoil the scam. We can make some cash. - You haven't waited too long? - Not at all. I'm pleased to introduce you to my sister, Georgette. There's no one like her. She's a fine girl, you know. And always up for a laugh. Aren't you, Georgette? But she never laughs in train stations. That's strange. Every time I return from a trip, she makes this face. Shall we go? I picked him up on the train. He's loaded. Take good care of him. Well, pal, I was telling my sister, you're a sport and I'm going to take good care of you. - Flowers, sir? - Oh, yes. - Do you like flowers? - Yes, I do. I'll choose them myself. No, some roses. I'll go now. Take him to the Paradis. I must leave you again. I forgot my luggage. - I hope you don't mind. - We have plenty of time. Here. Will you accept it this time? Before, I didn't know you. Thank you. - Do you like them? - They're beautiful. - Come. - And your brother? He'll meet us at the restaurant. It's nearby. Well, then. Tell me, is he a 'champagne guy'? No, he's a friend. Give him the prices. May I, madam? Don't we wait for your brother? No, we don't need to. - Oysters for starters? - Very good. No. Give us the menu. Very well, madam. - Gaston? - Yes, it's me. Don't stop. Keep playing. - How long have you been here? - A fortnight. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning. - Where's the captain? - Downstairs. - Alone? - Yes. Oh no, don't laugh. Tell me, have you ever been in love? What a question! Answer me, please, Georgette. That's sweet. You've called me by my name. How did you say that? Georgette. Say it again. Say it! I'm still waiting for your answer. And what about you? Have you known other Georgettes? Answer me... Yes, like every man. Was she pretty? Who? Her! Who else? So, you loved her? And... Have you forgotten about her? What about now? Now? Ah, now... I'm here. What's going on over there? A wedding party. They met here. So, before going on honeymoon, they wanted to come back here. They're about to leave. Let's go see them, shall we? I'm moved by your applause. I'd like to propose a toast to the charming Marie. One, two, three! Long life to Marie! Music! Have a good trip. We wish you all the best. Be happy! We wish you all the best, madam. They're getting close. If I don't go away tonight... I'm screwed. And the money? It won't be cheap. It's risky. Especially, taking you to America. Don't worry about that. Tell me your price. Let's not get carried away. I know you're finished. You won't find a penny. Don't worry about that! I'll get the money. I'll bring it tonight. I met a guy. He's loaded. Georgette's taking care of him. Well, then, 5,000 francs for you. And 15 for the woman. If it's too expensive, leave her here. Are you mad? She's my capital. So, deal? - The bride seemed very moved. - She's so pretty. Shall we go? What's the matter, Georgette? Nothing. What's the matter, Georgette? Why are you crying? What's the matter? - If you knew... - But what? It's all over. What's over, Georgette? Tell me. I'll understand, I swear, Georgette. There are some things I've never told anyone. You want to know why I'm crying? - Do you really want to know? - Yes, tell me. Oh no, I can't! Leave me alone, Marcel. It's better this way. Listen to me, Georgette. My real life has just started this morning. And I only met you this very evening. Me, my life has just ended. I met you too late... Leave me alone, Marcel. Trust me, it's better for you. Goodbye. - Is the last train leaving at 1:35? - Yes, sir, 1:35. - The bill, quickly! - Very well, sir. Good evening, Georgette! - Do you want some? - No, thanks. It's a success, tonight. The place is full. And the crowd is wonderful. I couldn't care less. Why? - What's the matter? - I've had enough of this life. Singing, drinking, laughing, every night. And start over again the next day. That's not a life, you know. Life is something else. What's going on? Are you mad? Maybe. Georgette, do you have something against me? I'm still your friend. Of course, sweetie. You know I like you. Shall I stay with you while you're getting dressed? No, leave me alone. I prefer to be on my own. Good evening, baroness. Let me introduce you to Georgette. The famous singer. I mean the star of this place. My wife. C?sar, the famous captain of the Vas-y toujours. A luxury cargo ship. A friend. Madam, for the Vas-y toujours, it's a great honour... to be honoured... The honour... My heavens, how bold you are! I've never heard you speak for such a long time. Does the girl inspire you? She's very flattered. Stop making fun of me. I'll keep an eye on you during the crossing. What crossing? That's right. I forgot to tell you. - We're leaving tonight. - We're leaving tonight? - To South America. - South America? What? He hasn't told you? She doesn't need to know. She and I, that's all the same. Isn't it, my dear? Madam is upset. All right, all right. We'll talk about it later, pretty girl. Did you bring the guy? Is he in the hall? Hey, I'm talking to you. Are you deaf? Did you bring him in? Yes or no? Did you bring him in? Yes or no? No. Are you joking? - He's gone? - Yes. You let him go? - You used to work better in the past. - Yes, indeed. Come on! What's going on? You really want to know? I made him go. You? You don't understand? You're a brute, you can't understand. A woman, what's that to you? Nothing! Less than nothing! You wish I'd brought him here helpless, don't you? What about me? Have you ever thought that I could have a heart? How sweet! Explain yourself. Yes, it's over. I have changed. At the station, you should have noticed I was different. I'd hoped right to the last moment that you wouldn't come back. But you came back. But listen, you've lost me. Don't you ever count on me! Clear off! I don't care about that! I just want the money. Where's the guy? You can run, you'll never get him. I saved him. You bitch! Let go of her! Let her go! You're mad! This is pure madness. Don't you hear the bell? I have to go on stage! Go easy on her. She's pretty. Leave me alone! That's not your business. Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! I'll kill you. - Where are you going? - Well... On board. I'm coming with you. - You have no money. - Don't worry about it. I'll have enough to pay you. I have friends in America. - Oh, in America... - What? Tomorrow, departure at 6 o'clock. If you can get the money. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll have the pleasure to hear our national star, Miss Georgette Lajoie singing. - You're not feeling well? - No. It's crowded tonight. People who appear ridiculous Confused in what they do or say For their quirks, faults quite minuscule They're inflamed by the things that we say Me, I know a way so that All I do is quite fine If your gaze is quite cross-eyed Or even your head is awry With the paunch of a mandarin Then this tune you must sing You can wear it in any season It's the fashion, It's the fashion Do like me, with good reason You can wear it in any season Isn't it a great song? So, get ready, we'll sing it together. I've noticed and it's quite a shame That your head is really quite smooth I think of my grandmother's knee When I see no hair showing through Don't get mad when people scoff They really haven't a clue Tell them now, for all their hair They're not as well off as you One, two, three, to them you will say My head is quite polished this way You can wear it in any season It's the fashion, it's the fashion Do like me, with good reason You can wear it in any season Don't get angry. You're pretty nice like this. See, you look like a baby now. How funny he looks! Look at the bourgeoise's face over there. She's not... Don't believe that I'm being nasty If I find this quite funny though The other day I met your woman In the arms of a gigolo That indeed's no joke, kind sir To think you're unlike all the rest And find you're not, but damn it all There's plenty more in your shoes Against all the mockery Just say: I'm now so trendy All together now! - You're a success. - Look, look. Look over there, on the left. Do you see that young man? - The little blond one? - No, a little more on the left. - You see? - The big dark-haired one? No, listen to me. Just next to Suzy's table. Wait for me. - The one and only! - Your heart! The Lovers of Midnight. Wounded heart Withered heart Onward rolls the night Moving far from bar to bar Wanders your ennui To each one in their turn Selling now your love Sad love One-way love The lovers of midnight When, despite yourself Oh heavens! Your lips moan: I love you Hearing your scream The man scornfully Always smiles wickedly Your eyes marvel in vain You remain the one they pay A body scented today May well wither away Of love you cannot have a say Wounded heart Withered heart Onward rolls the night Moving far from bar to bar Wanders your ennui To each one in their turn Selling now your love Sad love One-way love The lovers of midnight - You saw him? - Yes. That's him, isn't it? Yes, that's him. Hold on. Yes, that's him. Listen carefully. Go into the hall and tell him from me he must go. Something bad could happen to him, you understand? - Something bad? - Go! I'll explain it later. Mme Georgette Lajoie. I'm bringing her purse back. Why certainly, sir. I'll walk you to her. It's just you and me now! You can kill me! You can kill me! And then what? I'm not scared. I'll tell you now why I made him go. It's because I love him. I love him. You understand? I love him. Yes, I love him! I loved him right from the start! Open the door! Good evening, Miss. I'm glad to see you, pal. What happened to you, you quitter? We were just talking about you, weren't we, Georgette? Sorry to disturb you, Miss. I'm bringing your purse back. - You forgot your purse? - Yes, she left it on the table. Here. Thank you. We both thank you, pal. It's a good thing that Georgette is forgetful. It gives us the pleasure of seeing you again. Here, sit down. Ah, you know, I'm very glad to see you again. I'm very happy. So, you saw the club? Do you like it? Have you heard her singing? She's very good, isn't she? Cigarette? - Sure. - Here. Fanny! Come on in, sweetie. Mr Marcel, let me introduce you to my friend, Fanny. Nice to meet you. - Isn't she pretty? - Yes, she is. Come here, sweetie. You're all flushed. Your hair is a mess. Come, I'll fix it. Come on. Your hair parting isn't right. Lower your head, darling. Don't move. Here we are. You're beautiful! I'm not done. A bit of powder on your little nose. Go on, laugh! Aren't you happy? What's the matter? Come on. Call the police. A crime is about to be committed here. You're beautiful. Give me a big smile now. Some perfume. You, too. No? You're beautiful. You can go now. Quick! Call them. You betrayed me, didn't you? You both wanted to fool me? You won't! Hello? Hello, police station? I'm calling from the Paradis cabaret. The Paradis, yes. May I speak to the superintendent, please? I'm his substitute. You can talk. What? A crime? Someone is gonna be killed? Hello? Hello? I don't understand. Dangerous people? In the hall? Hello? In the hall? You... I'll find you! I'll find you. You'll tell them, when they get here, I had an emergency. They'll forgive me I couldn't wait for them. Fanny! Fanny! Hurry! Get on stage. We're waiting for you. - I can't. - Why can't you? Come on. Get on stage, quick. Marcel! Marcel! Answer me. You bitch. You're a good liar. He's your lover. - You're the one I love. - You disgust me. - But you're the one I love. - You had me fooled both of you. No, don't think that, please. Yes, he was my lover. It wasn't love. When he met me, I knew nothing about life. I was just a kid. I left with him. I thought I'd find the life I wanted so much. The big city... Yes, the big city... He had promised me wealth. Love... Yes, wealth. Love. Wealth. Look. Here it is. Love. Here, look. Marcel, listen to me. Save me. Let's run away. Take me far from here. Somewhere I could forget everything. I'm young. With you, I can rebuild my life. Help me. Save me. It's not too late. Yes, it's not too late. Yes, it's not too late. We'll go together. I'll take you. I'll take you with me forever. In an hour, a train will take us back where I came from. Stay here. Stay close to me. If you go, I won't have the strength to tell... To tell you everything. I am a thief. You, a thief? It's not true! Tell me it's not true! You don't believe me? Well, look at this money. Look! - Gaston took it. - Speak! Earlier, when you were unconscious. At the restaurant, I told you to go. That's the reason. I did everything to stop him, but I've failed. I'm lost. I'm lost... Police! Stop that immediately. Nobody move! Check everyone's ID and quickly! Those who haven't got one, arrest them. Whose money was it? - Tell me. - I took it from the bank. - What bank? - The bank where I work. - Why did you do that? - A moment of madness. The temptation of wealth. But as soon as I left, I got scared with what I'd done. When you talked to me here, I understood I had to take the train and go back. To return the money. No one would have known anything. It would have been happiness. When will the safe be checked? - It's no use. I'm lost. - Come on, answer me. What time? Answer me! Tomorrow morning at 9. - When is the train leaving? - In an hour. - Are there any others? - No, it's the last one. Papers. - Papers. - They've been stolen. He had them earlier. I saw them. I had them before. They took everything in my wallet. I know the story. In the meanwhile, we'll arrest you. - You can't arrest him! - Yes, we can. Give him 10 minutes. I swear he'll find his papers. - Let me search for them. - Stop joking. - You can't arrest him! - You want me to arrest you too? Leave that alone and give me the money. Are you kidding me? Here, smell it. Just a minute. What's that? "A minute"? Will you pay or not? Sit down. One, two, three, four, and five. Five?! We had a deal for twenty. Twenty with Georgette. But without her... I don't care! I want twenty! Captain, a woman is calling for you. Come on, then. Come on, go. I've always said women will be your downfall. Wait for me. And don't forget it's 20,000. - Where's the woman? - Upstairs. Send her in. You can go downstairs, madam. - You? - Yes, me. - Is Gaston here? - Don't you hear the virtuoso? You want to see him? I'll go get him. I came for you. - You came for me? - Yes, for you. You, get lost! Come here. Do you like me? Of course. Will you take me with you to America, alone? Alone with me to America? Wait. Before, listen to me. You must... - Gaston? - Yes. Right now. Yes! But first, you. No, after. Do as I say. Go! Go! Go! I've thought about it. I want 50,000 francs. Are you kidding me? What's this all about? Come on, what's going on? - You won't take me on board? - Get out! Goddammit! Bloody hell! You bastard! "55275. "October 1930. Valmont Marcel. Bank teller" Good. Sir, we only have 10 minutes. Just enough to reach the station. - Will you release him? - We'll see. Quiet! Marcel Valmont? Marcel Valmont? - Are you Marcel Valmont? - Don't be scared. Don't worry, they won't eat you. Quiet! - Are you Marcel Valmont? - Yes. Come over here, then. Lucky you! You found the exit. I'm telling you we only have one train. So, every minute spent... Take your hat off. - Marcel! - Move! - I've got your passport. You're free. - Just a second. Come here. - Name? - Marcel Valmont. You are free. Give his stuff back. Sign here. I've got your money. Freeze! Or I'll shoot you. You thought you could fool me? Give me the money. Do you understand? Go away or I'll call. Do you want me to hurt you? Give me the money. No kidding! Do you want me to shoot you? Let's get on with it. I'll take it myself. Hands up, Gaston Bouchard! You're caught! - Give me the handcuffs. - Bastards! You can be proud, you've made us run all day long. It was a shock, when I saw you in front of the police station. - Something wrong? - Nothing. I'm fine. - He shot at us. - He missed me. I got scared. I'm telling you, I'm fine. Come on, run. Bastard! Next time, I won't miss you! Bitch! I won't miss you! - Two tickets for Blois. - Return tickets? No, just single. Hurry up. The train is leaving in a minute. Change of programme - Bring me the file. - The cheques too? Yes, the cheques too. The portfolio securities. The file of the General Bank, too. Hello, boys! How are you? I'm a bit late because I've met the doctor's wife who asked me for 5%. What? You're already at work? And yet, it's Monday. I'm going to read the news. "There are only 10 princesses to marry in Europe." That's news. "Last statement of Mr Devoix in the Chamber." I don't care about it. "The arrest of Gaston Bouchard." "The arrest of Gaston Bouchard." He's been arrested! "He shot his mistress who's been found dying at the train station." What? Yes. "He shot his mistress who's been found dying at the train station." What a long face! Does it interest you? Poor woman. "She has been taken to the city hospital in a critical condition." You know what? I played cards with the tax collector. Mr Marcel. She's sleeping. She's getting better. Stay close to her. When she wakes up, she'll think she's dreaming.
