Yeah, I can feel it. But there's a little delay. Hmm. How about now? Now I felt it before you hit me. Whoa! Really?! Ha ha! Just kidding! It's fine. It's fine. Come on, now. This is serious. And expensive. I've been working on this new arm since the last time this happened, so please don't blow it up so fast this time. We'll see. Honestly, though, this doesn't even feel that weird now. I mean, maybe it's 'cause it already happened once before, but, I don't know. It feels like normal, I guess. I mean, I know it's "serious." Jake and Susan and Rattleballs all got pretty banged up. But for me, I guess it's like... I don't know. It feels right or something. What's weird, though, is that grass guy. Kinda rubs me the wrong way, that one. Yes... the mysterious grass guy. Tell me again what happened with the two of you this morning. Okay, so, as you know... after Susan had gone crazy and kicked Jake's butt, my grass arm got steamed and kicked her butt. Then it ran off and merged butts with my Finn Sword... and turned into this guy, and he starts talking smack! Mah! Maaaaah! What?! Mah! Mah! Hey, man, you stay back! Eeyuh! Muh eeyuh! Muh eeyuh! Hey! I-I said stay back, man! I seen what you did to Susan! Susan's... cells... are on fire. Susah! Susah?! Hey! Stop! You leave her alone, you weirdo! Susan's my friend! Fruh... freh... Friend. What?! Huh? I said, "What?" What did you say? "Whu?" Oh. Okay. My ears weren't working before, for some reason. Or my mouth. Sorry about that. Also, why are you dressed like me? Get a life, man. What?! You're dressed like me, man! Geez! Anyway, you just keep your hands off of Susan, guy. Susan? Can you hear me? It's Finn. Susan? Owwww! No touch. Oh. Sorry. You keep your hands off of my friend! What are you on abou... Aaah! Whoa! Oof! Don't worry, Susan! All right, all right! Enough! Truce, truce! Sorry, dawg, but I can't let you hurt Susan. I wasn't gonna hurt her! I was protecting her from you! Me? But... I'm Finn Mertens, man. I'm 100% hero. Everyone knows that. What?! I'm Finn Mertens! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sorry, man. I mean, I'm flattered, but... come on. No, you come on! Finn! Hold on, buddy! I'm coming! Jake! Boy, am I glad to see you! This bozo keeps saying he's me. Why don't you set him straight and tell him who the real Finn is. That one. What? Yeah, I don't know what you are. Some kind of demon-plant thing, probably. But I... Beating up on my poor brother like some kind of demon! Yeah! Show us your true form, demon! Yeah, show us! Show us! Show us! Show us! Show us! Show us! Show us! Oof! Whoa! Yeah, it's a real mess out here. We're gonna need the huge ambulance. Yeah, no. No. No, the huge... No. No. No. Put Banana Guard number 2 on the phone. Well, go get him! All right, all right. I think I've heard just about enoughhhhh... to know that I need to hear that all over again. Why don't you take it from the top? Okay, so, as you know... Hey, BMO. BMO? Oh, hey! My nose is back. Mmm! Stinks good in here. It's got that "big boy" musk. Socks, trash, butt... All the stinks of home. Ha! Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here! Ha! Man, I remember that day. That was when BMO lost control of the tank. Oh. Mm-hmm. Ha! Aw. Hey! Give me that! What the crease?! You gonna get it now, dude! That's the Grass Sword! Hyah! What the hey? Oh, no. No, no, no. I hate this. I liked it before. Who are you? Oh, you know... A curse. An emissary from beyond. Some kind of grass octopus spider. Grass Demon! You're making me nervous, dude. No! No, no, no! Don't worry about me. I am worrying about you! Dude, stop this! It's okay. I just gotta do something here. One sec. Okay, just one more second. So, how are you today? I'm good. I want out of here, though. I've pretty much done all I can do in here. You and me, we could do a lot better out there. I want out, too. Let's do it. Wait... do you mean out of the sword or out of the cocoon? Okay. I get it. When we get out of here, let me do the talking. And then you asked me to take it from the top. So... that guy is definitely an alternate-reality evil doppelganger, right? Huh. No. He's not even from a different timeline. Finn, he's just you. Yeah, you say that, but I'm me. So he's... BMO? News flash, hotshot... You're in the house, and you're made out of grass, and you're breaking my china, and I'm scared! What?! This grass guy's scaring BMO! Let's get him! Waaaaaaaaah! I've got a crush on Jake. Oh, no, no, no. I... can't... get... anything right! Hey, weedy! Hey. Just let me suck around a bit, okay, man? No way, buster! You're hurting BMO! I'm okay! Geeeeeeet outta here! Come on, Finn! Jake, uh, I'm still processing all this. United front! Okay. You scare BMO, you muck up my mom's records, you waste my br... You waste my breakfast syr... Breakfast syrup! Hey! Look at me when I'm mad! Look at my eyes! They're mad! And they have to look in your... Hey! They have to look in your eyes! Take my anger into your face! You're a fraud! You think you can fake Jake? You can't fake Jake! Cake, rake, lake, hamburger steak! Oh, man! Oh! You're a chum-bait! Jake, no! It's for fishing, BMO! It's something that fishermen use! And he is one! He's a chum-bait! Hey! Grass-me, do you want a Finn cake? But... only Finns get Finn cakes. That's true. Wait. That's that good sugary trash, like a big boy likes. Oh, geez. I really fell off the horse here. Maybe I'm not who I am. Sure we are. Weird days, man. Give me a minute to catch up. Hey, you gonna eat that BMO cake? My hands are still tacky from breakfast syrup. Hey, do you think Grass Finn's loco? I think he'll be okay. He just needs a place to crash while he figures some stuff out. Okay. ♪ Is waiting for the rising... ♪
