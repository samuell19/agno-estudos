- Did you hear that? Babe? - No. - It was really loud. It was upstairs. - Oh, it's okay, it's nothing. - No, it's not okay. - Let's go back to sleep. - Well, you didn't hear it, it's really, really loud. Can you please check? - Nothing's gonna happen, we're in the middle of nowhere. - No, I know that we're in the middle of nowhere, but that makes it scarier. - Oh, it's. - Houses is in the middle of nowhere get broken into. Houses in the middle of nowhere have things happen. - If somebody wants to break in and that's the only sound they make, then they can have everything they want. - All right. - Also, this isn't even our house, so as long as they don't wake me up, I don't care. - All right. Wait, my iPad's downstairs too. - Your iPad? - Yeah my iPad. Did you lock the door? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay, I'm gonna check. - Check myself. - Fine, I will check, I will. I got it. I'll never end of it. - Okay, thank you. Anything, anything weird? - No, your iPad is safe. - I think you came from upstairs though. - The attic? - Yeah. - It's probably just a raccoon or something. - I think I know what a raccoon sounds like. This was like a man sound. - It's probably a big raccoon. - No, like. - No case closed. - Have to be like a really big raccoon. - Please turn off the light. - Okay, I'm turning off the light, but it's not a big raccoon. And I love you. -  I know. -  No, not I know. Not I know. -  I love you too. -  Okay, thank you. - Oh, do you to get Lenny cat food? - I don't think so. Is it this way? - No. - Okay. - You been here before? - I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. - It's this place right over there. - What are we doing again? Buying a hard drive. - Oh yes, we have to get hard drives. - Isn't there like a producer that does that for you? - Yes, normally a producer does that or a PA. I guess producers are too busy to do crap like that. - How are you gonna be gone for? - I think just a few days. I really hope not more. - Isn't there a pizza place? Like bread up here. - Yeah. We've gone there before, it's good. But I don't know, I don't really feel like sitting down. - Wait, is that the one with the macaroni cheese pizza? Is it? - I think they do have that, but that does not sound good, and I do not want that. And I also don't want anything with meat. Oh my God, I'm so full, I think I'm gonna lay down when I get inside. - I kinda want a sweet treat. - What? - What? I want like, you know, like a brownie or something. - We ate so much, I'm about to bust. - Yeah, I'm full of dinner too. But I think I would like to cap off the night with a sweet treat is what I'm saying. - I think we have some grapes in the freezer. - Babe, no I said a sweet treat. I don't want like a frozen fruit salad. - No, you put a little lemon on them. - There are some people who believe in ghosts and there are some people who don't. If you are the believe in ghosts kind, then this story is about one. And if you are the don't believe in ghosts kind, well just for fun, this story is about one anyway. His name was Casper and he was surely the most unusual ghost there ever was or wasn't, depending on how you feel about it. Every time. - Can I turn this off? - What's that? - The TV? - Oh yeah, you can turn that off. What's your thoughts on this haircut? -  Hmm, weird. You want it for yourself? - Yeah. Weird in a good way? Like full weird? - I mean on him, it's kind of weird on a good way, but I don't know if it would be the same on you, 'cause he has completely different hair than you. -  What do you mean? It's both brown. What other? It's straight brown hair. - His is like way thicker, so it like sticks out further. But when you do it, it's gonna like clinging to your head. - Okay. I think this is what I need right now. I need something to make me stand out as a photographer. I feel like this is my key to getting more work, is to have an ugly ass, fucked up haircut. - But you wanna get recognized for your work, not for your hair. - I mean, if's the same end goal, I don't know why it matters. It's me getting more work, you know, I'll do anything to get more work. Cut off my fucking head if it would help to get a deal, you know. - This is based off of the photograph? Oh. - Yeah. You not like it? - We can go clean it up. Do you wanna, should we go clean it up? - What's wrong? Just tell me what's wrong. - That's a full on mullet. This is what you wanted? - Yeah, I like it, I think it's fine. - It's definitely like British looking. Oh my God. Babe, did you hear that? - What? What's going on? - Shh. Shh. There's someone, something just got knocked over in the kitchen. I think someone's in here. - What did you say? - Did you lock up the house? - Yes. - Shh, shh. Do you hear that? - What's wrong? - We should go look, we should go look to see if someone's in the kitchen. - Someone's in the kitchen? Wait, Lenny, what are you? Wait, no don't, wait don't eat that. What the hell? What the hell? Oh it's okay. Lenny just knocked over one of your bowls. You okay, boo? - No, it just feels weird here. I just don't like it. - What do you mean? - 'Cause I just, I never got spooked like this at my last place. - It's okay. You just need to get used to it and you gotta know that there's no one out to get us. And if there were and they break into our house, I'll just whoop their ass. It's just that simple, okay, boo. All right? Okay, can you turn off the light now. - Babe, don't forget, we gotta pay rent. -  Oh, okay. - I'll just send you my half right now. You got some big plans while gone, you gonna have some guy time? - No, I'm not. I mean, who would I have guy time with? - Budd. - No. No, I don't really hang out with funny anymore. He's became a full blown gambling addict. You know about this? - No. - Yeah he is. - What happened? - He just gambles, He gambles all the time. And Jane almost left him cause he gambled his rent. - What? - Like two months in a row, it's really bad. Every time I hang out with him, it's just sob story after sob story, and it's just ugh. - What about Andy Sandberg? - The big actor that I'm friends with. Yeah, he doesn't have time for me. Is that surprising at all? - Didn't he say he had like a set photographer gig for you? You guys could like, hang out, do a little work. - What do you want, you want me to hang out or to get a job? - I mean, both. You need to take advantage of this free time that you have. Like you don't have any photo gigs and yeah that sucks. But you have a ton of free time. Like you could go out, you could have a show, you could create, get a bunch of photos. - Yeah, maybe I'll do a show while you're gone. Maybe the next few days, I'll just do a show. That's a really good idea. - Just promise me something. - Right, okay. - You'll try to go outside. - Right. - Take some photos. - Okay. - Be inspired. - Right. - You won't just lay in the living room and drink beer. - Okay. - Maybe you try to call Budd, maybe he could use you right now. - Okay, gotcha. - I'm definitely calling Jane to see what all of this is about. - Yeah, you maybe you need to do that for sure. - Just call Budd. - Okay, I will, stop. - You know, this gambling thing is crazy, man. I'm in Gamblers Anonymous, did I tell you that? There's a guy in there who bet his family dog. Anyways, I'm not one to talk. 'Cause I don't know if I actually told you this before, but I bet Jane's car. I was in a real bad spot and I really didn't have any more money left to gamble, so I was like, hey, you know what? I do have the pink slip in my pocket, which is weird. Anyway, there's no real coming back from that. I mean, you gamble someone's car. I mean, that's just like all time low. But anyway, that place is great. I'm learning a lot. And a lot of the people in there have similar situations. I mean, some of them were even a lot way worse than cars. Hey man, are you listening to me, can you hear me, hello? - Yeah, man, that sounds sounds crazy. Hey, listen, the reason I called you originally was because I'm kind of in a pinch right now, money speaking, and I might need a borrow like a couple of hundred from you for rent. And you know, if you don't got it, it's totally fine. - But wrong with you, dude? I don't have any money, I gambled it away. I'm in Gamblers Anonymous. - Yeah, no, sorry, I guess. - Weren't you listening to my story. - Yeah, no, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's fine. - Dude, even if I had a buck for you to borrow, Jane manages all my accounts, I don't have access to anything. I mean, if I found a crumble cash in my cargoes, you know I'm gonna put it straight on Caveman Keno. - All right, Lenny. I'm gonna have you in the studio today. But guess what I got you, dude. I got you some tune on toys. So there's some tuna right here. I got you a bed right here. Papa's gonna be in the house for about two hours and I'm gonna come back, I'm gonna grab you and that's it. - We just love this neighborhood so much. - Yeah, it's a great neighborhood, it really is. - It feels like it's gotten so popular. I mean, we're like having to be like 10th in line for every place. - That's the annoying thing about this whole area. - I guess so. Stop put that down. Don't touch, you don't need to open anything. Sorry. -  It's okay. - So are we the first people seeing the place? - Technically you are the second couple to see it. - Okay. - But to be honest with you, the first couple didn't really seem that interested. - Okay. - So if you put in an. - Put that down. - So all you have to do is just send me this application. - Okay. - And also there is a $50 application fee. - That's okay. - There's a background check. - Totally get that. - Yeah, so you can send it to that email right there. And there's instructions. If you have any questions at all, just let me know. - Okay. Put that down. No, put it back where it was. Nope, it wasn't. - Come on in. - CJ, put it back where it was. - So welcome gang. Just to let you know, the past tenant stuff is still here, but they're moving out in a week and we're gonna repaint everything and this place will be ready the first of the month. - Amazing, thanks. Oh my God, I love it, I love it. - It's a big place for 1,600. - No, I know, that's what I'm saying. It's like a really good deal. Like I think we should jump on it. - Yeah. - Honestly. - Hey gang. Any questions, concerns? - Yeah, is it really just 1,600? - Yes, and that's monthly. - It's amazing. We've been staying in a sublet around the corner for a month, a month now. And this is just the best neighborhood. Like we love it. - We haven't seen anything around here under two grand though. - Shut up. He thinks it's a scam. Can you believe that? Just you are so. Sorry. - Well, you know what? The landlord of this place is like really old and I don't really think he cares about money. So it's kind of like a perfect, you know, situation. - I did see someone else leaving. Was she interested or? - Who was that? Oh yeah, so there is one person ahead of you. But to be honest, that person didn't really seem that interested in it, so I'd recommend getting an application in ASAP, which I put some right there. - Yeah great. - Great let's do it. - Cool. - Great. - Okay. - Awesome. - Let me know if you have any other questions. - No, I got a question. Is that you, in the painting? - Who, that guy? -  Looks just like you. - Oh, that does look like me, weird, oh my God. And he is, what the heck? I didn't even notice that, that's just crazy. - Yeah that's not me. But yeah, if you guys have any other questions I'm gonna be down there. - Thank you so much, okay, sounds good. - Yeah, that's great. - I'll be in the bathroom.

So that's kinda perfect. - You guys like the place? - We love it. This is actually perfect for us, it's like what we've been looking for, for a month now. - Love it. - So we're, we just want you to know we're very serious. - Keen. - Keen, we are keen. -  Let's do it. - Okay, so only thing that I really need is the $50 application fee. - Yes. Yes, we can give that to you. Here, we have it actually. - What is this? - It's totally fine, let's just you keep that. We just want you to know that we are very serious. - Okay. You know, legally I have to still do the. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's fine, that's fine. And we can like pay more of a deposit if you want. That's totally fine.

I just am always spending, you know, I spend a lot of time here. - Crazy. - So that's the photo? - Yeah. - It's a lot of money to pay somebody to kill a dog. - Well, I think they're talking about the phone thing. - Must be a nice phone. - Well, hey, it's crazy running into you man.

I got that one of all the shit in the river that you took. - Oh you got that one? - Yeah man. - Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I should have another one coming out soon. - I mean, you're actually doing it, man. It's so cool. It's like, it's pretty fucked when you think about what everybody back home is up to. Like, I'd swear every person I talk to down there is completely addicted to drunk driving. - Right, yeah. Yeah, I don't know, man. I just, you know, I didn't really have a reason to stay, so just got out. - Well you really inspired me, man. Like if you would've ever come out here, I sure as hell wouldn't have. - Yeah.

Let's keep hanging. Let's like, let's do something, like let's get some beers or something and just. Okay, come on. - Yeah, yeah, for sure, yeah, yeah.

Can you get up real quick? - Yeah. - I need to get a towel. - Do you always have your bed in the living room or? - No, this is just, Whitney's gone, so, we have the team in here, so I like to. - Gotcha, it's so sick. I mean, y'all have like really set up such a nice place. Like I love how you just kind of like put things wherever you want and you don't really care about how it looks. - Yeah, thanks man. - Holy shit, are you friends with Nick Kroll? - No, that's actually Andy Sandberg. - You're friends with Andy Sandberg. - Yeah, I am actually. Well old friends, I don't really see him that much anymore. - I love, "Always Sunny." That's the kind of I want to do. I want to make like prestige television, like that's the new movies, you know what I mean? But I just keep getting these little parts in these indie movies, which is cool because you know, there's a chance, a bunch of 'em could go to Sundance and then I can just blow up, which sounds lame or whatever, but. - Seems like you're acting a lot lately. So you're like staying busy. - Yeah, I mean, honestly, yeah. I've been busy, you know, like I've been working quite a bit, just like, you know, small things, but like I'm trying to take it seriously because you know, it's a privilege to get work in general in this business. It's a harsh, like vicious business, you know. And so I take it seriously. Like I'm either shooting something or if I'm not shooting, I'm prepping for something or I'm auditioning or. - Are you prepping for something now? I mean, I'm only saying that because of what you're wearing, which is. - I mean, oh shit, I totally forgot I was wearing this. - Yeah. - I know. No, I mean, in a way, yeah. I was doing a fitting earlier today and in the costumer, she told me to wear this to kind of break it in because it's. - Oh, right. - Right, you know. Who knows, right? And you took this photo? Yeah, that's, yeah, I took that photo, yeah. - Yeah, this was in that photo book. - Yeah, yeah it is. - I think when I'm seeing, when I look at it, I'm thinking. - All the locks are. - The locks are just like popping out. - And the red is cool. - The red, yeah, the red part of the locks. Yeah, see, I would never, I would just walk right by that and say, okay, you know. - Yeah. - That's why I don't do photos, I would just walk right by that and go, eh. Morning pal. - Morning. - Did you stay over last night? - Oh yeah, man. Drank a lot. You passed out, just wanted to make sure you were okay. - Yeah, I did drink a lot. Hey, just a heads up on today. Ow my head. I have a pretty packed day today and so. - Gotcha. What you getting into today? - I have some, I gotta do a lot of emails, but I have to do some photo stuff. - Oh yeah, you gotta show me some of your new photos. - Yeah, for sure. I think we can, yeah, we should do that. I mean, not today, but later, I think would be good. But for right now, I think we just need to. I know this is awkward, I'm sorry, but I need you leave, so. - I can't leave. - What's that? - I'm dead, man. - Right, yeah, no, I feel bad too. So if we can just. - I can't, I can't leave. I think you're the only guy who could see me. - What do you mean by this? What are you telling me? - I think I'm dead. I think I'm a dead ghost. - Okay. How much did you have to drink last night? - Nothing. 'Cause I can't drink, I can't really do anything. I can't take my shoes off if I wanted to, 'cause I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm a ghost. - Okay, cool. Just please get the fuck outta my house. - Dude, I know this sounds insane. I know this sounds crazy. I know what it sounds like okay. I've been walking around for the last, I don't know how long and nobody has noticed me and then suddenly you can talk to me and see me and it feels really good. And I don't wanna lose this right now. And so if maybe we could figure something out to where we keep being able to talk to each other. Maybe I can understand what the fuck is going on right now. - Just stop talking for two seconds please. I think I need some coffee before I hear this bullshit. You wanna come? You wanna come and get some coffee with me? - Oh yeah. Thanks for understanding man. - Right. - It's kind of a trip, dude, it's like. -  That's fine. - I don't know where I've been or what I've been doing. I just sort of showed up. To be honest with you, this is the first time I've even been inside in the last, who knows how long. - Hey man, are you homeless? - What? - Oh, sorry, not you Steve. - Oh, that's cool. Hey man, let me ask you a question, did you drop any grapes last night? - I don't think so. - All right, well someone dropped some grapes and it wasn't me. - Right. - I'm not a grape guy myself, but my fucking dog got into 'em and I guess dogs aren't supposed to eat grapes or something. Anyway, if you ever do get any grapes at some point, please keep an eye on your grapes. - This guy's obsessed with grapes. - Dude, shut up stop. - What? - Again, sorry not you it's. - Oh, that's okay. - He can't see me. - I mean, I'm probably rambling here grapes. You don't understand, like, I didn't get much sleep last night. - Just to demonstrate. - I was grabbing my poor dogs. - He cannot hear or see me. He's looking through me right now at you. - She's terrified. - He's talking to you. - And I'm like hey, I'm terrified. - I don't exist to this man. Look at this, watch. - It's so weird to be in this moment because 10 years ago, if you would've told me that I would be terrified of a little dog dying. - I'm sorry. I know you feel crazy. I mean, imagine being me, that guy just looks right through me man. Like that's crazy. I feel nuts. - Okay, well listen, I feel like what's happening here is that you're going through a lot of stress and I'm curious if you have family that you can call. If not, then I can probably help you find a shelter, if you need one, or something. - I can't call anybody because I'm dead. I can't use a phone, I can't even talk into it, nobody'd hear me. I'm about as dead as old grape dog over there. I'm dead. Maybe you could set me on fire. If you set me on fire, you could see that the fire doesn't do anything to me, 'cause I'm dead, man. What are you doing? -  Looking for my camera. - Why? - Well, I mean, if you're dead and I take a photo of you, nothing's gonna show up, right? - Oh yeah, smart. Why don't you use your phone? - Oh, phone's dead. - You didn't charge it last night? - No, leave me alone, stop. Okay, go, shift, yeah. Do I need the? Oh the flash is on. You ready. Three, two, one. - Just to be clear, I'm hoping I'm in this photo. I'm on your side. I really want to be in this photo, I want you to be right. Hey, fingers crossed I'm in it, to tell you the truth. I mean that would just be, that would make my day, if it was all, you know, some kind of prank or something. - Nope. - I'm sorry, Clay. Clay, I'm sorry. Clay, dude, I'm really sorry, man. -  Go, go away please. - I know that this is freaky, dude, I'm freaked out too, you know. - Hey man, I don't really know you that well okay. So can you just go away now, please? - I know that you don't know me that well, like, but you're the only guy I knew whenever I moved out to L.A. okay. I texted you, you never even responded to me man. And now I'm dead and you're the only person who can see me. And I mean, I'm scared, dude. Like I don't wanna be alone, man like, this sucks. Clay. - I need to use the restroom. - What does this mean? - Please stop. Just stop talking please. Do you wanna close the door? - Yeah, I already started so I can't. There's nothing I can do about it now. - Okay, I'll just give you some privacy. -  Thanks, yeah. - How's the coffee? - It's good, I mean it's not great, that's fine. Stop asking me questions, I can't think right now. - Okay. You can ask me some questions if you want. - Okay, how did you die? - I don't know, man, I wish I knew. - Do you have a last memory or something that you can work off of? - No, totally hazy, I got nothing for you there. - Right, okay cool, that's very cool. - I don't know, man, I just like kind of began to exist in a new kind of way. - Right. - All I do is follow people around. - Yeah. - Been following you around for who knows how long. - Okay, and that's just what you do now? - Oh yeah, follow people around. I follow people around, I look at people, then people go inside and then I'm outta luck. - Right, 'cause you can't go through walls, you can't pick up anything. - Dude, I can't move any, everything weighs like a billion pounds. - Right. What about an online obituary, have you looked into that? - Dude, I can't open a door, you think I can click clock away on the keyboard? - Okay. All right, let me see here. Yeah, dude, I'm not really finding your obituary anywhere. Oh wait, here's a Whit Thomas. Died 2019, does that sound right? - No. - Oh wait, he's a convicted pedophile. Wait, why would they include that? - Dude, you're not gonna find an obituary, man. My family probably doesn't even know I'm dead. - God, this is fucking annoying. - Why are you taking this so hard? I'm the ghost. All that changes about your life is now you got a special little gift. - What gift does that? - Dude, you shine. - I do what? - You shine, dude, like the kid from, "The Shining." "I see dead people." That's you, you got that now. - Why do I only see you? - I don't know. You didn't know I was dead until I told you. -  Right. - So maybe you see dead people all the time, you just don't know it. - Stupid gift. - Oh, oh this is interesting. Maybe I'm here to help you. And that's how I get to the afterlife, I'm supposed to fix you in some way. - There's something to fix here man, I'm good. - Dude, I've been falling around for a week now, man, you're a loser, there's a lot to fix. You got money trouble, I can help you with that, I bet. - I do have money trouble yeah. - Okay, so how can I help you with money trouble? - Help me rob a bank, or you rob a bank and I'll keep the money. - I can't touch anything. - Oh right. How can you help me? - Okay, just gimme a sec, let me think. You think too. - All right, I'll think too. - You got anything? - No, all I got was I was trying to remind myself to think and all I was doing was thinking about thinking, but I'll think now. Well I got an idea. Hi Budd. - Hey Clay. Thanks. Thanks for letting me own this game, dude. - Yeah, I didn't really know you played. - Yeah, I play. - What the fuck did you do to your hair, dude? - I think I'm trying something new and I think I fucked up, but. - It looks terrible. - Yeah thanks.

My Woody Allen glasses. -  Yeah. -  Yeah, that's not good. - All right, so we get in and we get out and then we bet, once we're up we bet. - Right, right. - Get up, get out. - Good. Yeah, it makes sense. - Hey, this is not your money, so there's nothing for to worry about. - Right exactly, it's not my money, so it's not a big deal. - Right. - Yeah. Look, these guys in here they're losers. They're not the normal type of person I would hang out with. - Okay, yeah, I didn't think they. - Just want you to know that going in. Don't judge me on that. - Oh my God. - Oh yeah. - Oh what a view. - Dude, this Arnold guy, look, he really, really likes me. - Is he the host of this thing? - Yeah. That's the only reason why we're at this home game. - This is a home? - Yeah, I told you it was a home game. I've been kicked out of every other home game. This is the only one we can go to. - This is a house we're walking in to? - Yeah, dude, this guy's a big time movie producer. Come on. - What kind of movies does he make? - Oh, look, I've said this a million times already, but I have to say again, you absolutely cannot say anything about this to Jane. - Right, of course. - Got it? - If you get a chance would you ask him what movies he does. - I'm not gonna tell anyone. - Okay. - I can do you one better. - Okay let's go. - What movie says this guy done? - Hey Budd. - Hey, how are you? - Is this your plus one? - Yes. - Okay, come on in. - Thank you. - What movies as this guy done? - Buddy.

Just lift 'em up casually. - You okay there, "Rain Man?" You're gonna be glad I made you buy more chips 'cause 300, I would've wiped you out 10 minutes. - Okay, everybody else has folded. It's just you and the big, don't look at me, it's just you and the big man. He's only doing that to see if you're gonna raise him, so call it. - You sure you want to do that little man? Last night we had fun But today I don't know what I'm outside, too drunk in the backyard I'm dreaming dreams of her White wine and shrimp cocktails Big money, handshakes, congratulations And I know, I know, I know It's not what I should be doing But this is what I'm doing I know, I know, I know, I know This is what I'm doing This is what I'm doing And I know, I know, I know It's not what I should be doing This is what I'm doing This is what I'm doing - The road is a lot easier to get. Yeah, I wanna sit down too. You're ready to go Whit? - Yeah. - Who's Whit? - Oh, I didn't say that, I said what. - I said what. - What? -  Oh yeah, I gotta go. -  Get off my grass. -  This a blanket. Oh yeah, let me just yeah, oh, you got it. - Okay, can I have the remote? -  What's that? -  The remote. - Oh. - For the TV. - Yeah, it's right here. All right. - Thank you. - I think you're all set up here. - Thank you so much, that was really? - Yeah, that's good. You dropped something. Oh, there remote, do you need that? Oh, okay you're out. - When was the last time I saw you? - I don't know, I don't really remember. - Was it at your mom's shrimp bucket brawl, whenever you were visiting home, like five years ago. - Oh yeah. - Dude, you won man. - Yeah, I ate a lot of shrimp. - All that shrimp. - Yeah, but you know I got sick that day. Remember that? - Oh yeah, you were throwing up all over the place. - 'Cause I had all that snapper. - Well, you know the saying. -  Yeah. - You never mix snapper with shrimp. -  Yeah, exactly. - Oi, you like taking my girlfriend's money, do you? - Hello. - Hey, so my flight is getting delayed, like 30 minutes, I think they're saying. I'll just like text you right before we depart. - Okay. -  Are you okay? You sound tired. - Yeah, I am tired, sorry. - What, are you seeing right now? - Yeah. -  Babe, come on. - Okay, I can't wait to see you. -  I know me too. Okay, I love you. - Love you too. - Bye. - I'm almost positive your cat can see me. So what's the plan today? - I gotta go pick Whitney up at the airport. - Oh, whoa, are you gonna tell her about me? - No. - So am I just gonna stay here in secret? - No man, you're not gonna live here. Fun's over dude. - What? No. - I mean, you kind of don't have a choice here, man. - You can't just throw me away like I'm fucking trash. - Okay, let's just, okay, no, we don't need to get heated here. I think what I meant to say and I'm sorry if I wasn't being clear, is I'm not totally ready to have you and my life 24/7 while I'm also trying to live with my wife, right. We need to slowly work you in on this. And the only way we can do that, is if we're on the same page, okay. Does that make sense? - Okay. All right, yeah. - Okay, this is what I'm thinking. Give me a week. - A week, dude that's a long time, man. - A week's not that bad. - What am I supposed to do for a week? - Just think about all the things that you can do, that other people can't, hop on a bus, go to Disneyland, stay there for seven days, you can sleep over there. There's so many things that you can do. Is there anything that you wanna do that you couldn't do when you're alive? Well, I think now's a good time to think about what those are, right, and do 'em. So, right, seven days, give me a week, deal? - Yeah, I mean, I don't feel like I have a choice. - Okay. All right. - I'm not alive, I'm a ghost. I am a ghost. I can walk wherever I want and I can see whatever I want and nobody knows I'm here. I hate walking, I miss driving, I miss sweating, I miss being hungry and thirsty. I miss burping and farting. I'm in L.A. and I'm alone and I'm dead. Does anybody know I'm dead, other than Clay? Maybe Clay's right, maybe I should try having fun. I could do whatever fucked up shit I want and nobody will even care. And there's so much fucked up shit to get into in L.A. Wish I would've done more fucked up shit when I was alive. - The next stop is, Southwest Museum Station. -  Taco Bell. -  Do you remember this? -  What happened to that? - I feel like we got like in a lawsuit. I feel like you, you can't use the word Baha, right, that's like, gotta be copyright. - Oh, like what, like Baha Men? - No, is that the same Baha? Don't they spell it with an H, like? - Oh yeah, it is Baha with an H. Do you have my jacket? - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Okay, if you're not cold, gonna be cold. Thank you. - Yeah. I have sweater so I'm warm, you're warm. - Well, I have heat at my place if you wanna, just down there. - Yeah, let's do it. - Yeah. I not a Mountain Dew kind of. I know it's weird, it's not just bad for you. - It smells so good in here. - Oh thanks. Oh, it's the candle. I thought you were talking about my perfume, but my roommate actually makes those. - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think it is the candle probably. Is that her job? - Sort of. She has a lot of jobs, she's like me, you know, just an artist. Do you want wine? Probably shoulda asked before I poured it. - Yeah, sure. Is she home, is your roommate home? - No, she is out of town, she gets back Monday. So, it's just us. - That's cool. - Do you live with anyone? - Yeah I do. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, I live with my, it's like my brother I live with. - Oh cool. - Yeah. - It's yeah, it's weird. - Not but. - I know it's like, you know, whatever. It's like your siblings kind of not. - Yeah. - Yeah. - But. - I feel like it gets lonely by myself. Sometimes I'm like, I wanna get a pet. Do you have any pets? - Yeah, we have a little family dog, a Yorkie. - Oh my God, no way. You're so cute. - Yeah. - That's why you're so cute, runs in the family? - You're cute. I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom really quick. - Oh, it's okay. It's fine, it's fine. It's right over there, just through that door. - Okay, cool. I'm sorry, should have done it when I came in. - It's fine, you don't have to say sorry, I have bathrooms. I've got another one upstairs too. - Okay, yeah. I'm gonna do this one, thank you, sorry. Sorry, that's better. - Good, you wanna go see my room? - Yeah, let's do it. - Okay. - Not like do it, sorry. I mean. -  What did you mean? - I meant like, let's see your room. -  I'm just kidding. My room was just here. -  Oh wow. Cool. - Oh yeah, that's that light I told you about, remember? - Oh yeah. - Changes colors. - Oh my God, it does look like a seashell kind of. It's like The Little Mermaid or something. My jacket's stuck. Fuck. -  What, what is it? -  I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay, it's fine, it's really. -  I'm sorry. -  No, I'm sorry. I should not push this. - No it isn't, no what? No, it's not you, I'm sorry. This. - It happens. You don't have to explain, it's fine. - I'm there pal. - It's really fine. - Hey mom, hey. Not much. Hey, I was wondering if you could gimme a ride, I'm in Highland park right now, I don't have my car and. Okay, cool. Do you have Eggos at home? Okay. - Oh man, I haven't gone to this Farmer's Market in so long. I'm gonna get an ice coffee when we get there. Oh yeah, and I think we should drive, 'cause I'm gonna get a bunch of groceries. - No babe, let's walk, we spend like half the time looking for parking room. - No, no, no, no, I'm gonna get a bunch of groceries. - Actually, yeah let's drive. - Oh yeah. - Let's drive. Let's drive. - I had kind of a crazy night last night man, I was wondering if you. - Do you have the keys? Do you have the keys? - Yes, I have the keys. - So you don't gotta react to me. - Why you acting like such as spas? - Just unlock the door. Yeah, no, just keep it the keys before we get in here. - Where are you guys going, maybe I could just sit with. - You need to calm down. This is what I'm always talking about. - It'll be cool if you just let me go with you. - You're not calm. - I promise, I'll be cool. -  You need to chill. - Clay. - And I absolutely cannot forget to get flour because it is the ingredient in the recipe that I'm making. What's that smell? Babe, is that the trash? - I don't know. - Do you smell that? - No, not really. - Babe, oh my God. That smells so bad, babe, you gotta take it out. - Right now? - Yeah, take out the trash please. You just think I wanna live in this stench. - Hey Clay. I know that we had an agreement and I'm not supposed to talk to you, so you don't go out to react to me. Especially, 'cause Whitney's probably in there. But ghost time is like way different than human time. I think it's closer to dog time. It's kind of a trip man. Like I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm getting into some sort of creepy situations. And so I thought maybe we could come up with a new agreement, you know. Actually maybe if you could just give me a thumbs up so I know that you can hear me because this is kind of freaking me out, you're not responding. You do still have your gift, right, Clay? Clay. Hey Clay, dude, I'm sorry man, that's all my shit, dude. I shouldn't have, you know, burdened you with that stuff. So, you got every. Hey dude, dude, I crossed the line, pal, I'm sorry.

Is there a Sydney that lives here? - What's this about? - Okay, how do I explain this? She posted something online that. - Ceramics. - No, no, not ceramics. It's something, it's different. And she's experiencing something I'm experiencing. And I was wondering if I could. Is she here? - Sydney died. - Oh okay, I didn't know, I'm sorry. - Yeah. So, so, yeah. - Can I ask how she died, if that's not too much or? - She killed herself. -  I'm so sorry. - No, it's cool. It's fine, man, it's fine. She'd been struggling for a long time. -  Yeah. - Haunted, haunted they said, haunted by hallucinations, you know, veering in and out and then just snapped. And just wasn't wasn't here and couldn't get back that's all. It's what the doctor said. -  I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I felt bad for her. I felt really, really, really badly for her, I did. She was a good friend, she was a good person. - Oh, hey babe, I'm making that spicy stew for dinner, the one that we were talking about. And yeah, I got that wine that we both like. - Oh. - What's wrong with you? - I don't know, I don't feel good again. So, I think I'm gonna go lay down actually. - Okay. I feel like you're not drinking enough water. - What was that? - What was, what? - What was that noise? - Oh, I just took out the recycling because someone decided to drink a lot of beer while I was gone. - You closed the door? - Yeah, the door is closed. Why would I leave the door open? -  Whit, get outta there. - No, - Get the fuck outta my house right now please. - No, I hate it out there. - I don't care if you hate it, I want you outta my house right fucking now. - Babe, are you in the bathroom? - What's that? - Are you talking to someone? - What? - Come back to bed, what are you doing? - I'm just goofing off in the bathroom. I'll be back in bed soon, okay boo. -  Okay. - You making me look like a fucking weirdo in front of my wife. - Maybe you look like weirdo 'cause you are weirdo. - Mean me outside right fucking now. - Or what? - Or I won't be your friend anymore. Ow, ow. Okay, get in the car, let's go. - Dude, Clay, I don't want to man. - Get in the car, man. - What, why? - I'll explain when we get in the car. - Well, you gotta close your back door, dude. - Oh God dammit. - Where are we going? - Just I'll explain everything when we get in the car, let's go. Okay, here we go. Let's go. - I'm not getting in here until you fill me in a little bit. Gimme some details. - Okay, I can't talk to you around other people. So we're gonna get in the car and drive far away from people so we can have a conversation okay. Now please get in the car. - Okay, all right, thank you. Clay, Clay don't. Don't do that Clay. Clay. -  Morning. Morning boo, boo. Wake up. - What time is it? -  It's like 5:30 I think. So I got a job I think. - Oh, through Randy? - Yeah, one of his friends is like directing something and they just need an onset photographer, but it's in the mountains and they need me like today. - Right now? - Yeah, I'm wondering if I can use the car if that's cool? - Yeah, you can use the car, I don't need it. - Yeah, so all right. I gotta go right now. - You're leaving now? - Yeah. Aw. - Bye. Have fun. -  Thank you boo, boo. -  Call me. -  Okay, I'll call you. All right. Bye. Bye, boo. - Unacceptable, dude unacceptable, man. What the? You locked me in a fucking car. That's not something a friend would do, man. I'm not a dog in a Walmart parking lot, Clay. What the fuck man? -  Oh shit. - You know Clay, that money that's in your pocket right now is my money, dude. I helped you win that with my abilities. You get to live a comfortable life right now because of me, man. - Okay, okay, okay, stop, stop. I owe you okay. - Yeah, you do. - But you have to understand, what you did last night is creepy as hell. You haunted me like a ghost. You haunted me like Casper the ghost. - Casper is a friend. And that's all I'm trying to do is be your friend. - You were acting like your friend last night, okay. So I will admit that wasn't the best reference, okay. - Yeah, it wasn't. But it is, from my perspective, it is a perfect reference. 'Cause I am your friend, like Casper. - I think you missed the point here. What I'm saying is you acted like a fucking creep last night. And I said, give me seven days and you gave me a day. - Dude, I'm telling you, time is totally different. - Do you know how to track the sun? If the sun's out and it goes down and comes back up, that's one day. Just keep a tally in your head. You know how to keep the directions to my house in your head, just keep a tally of the days. - I'm a ghost, I'm not a mountaineer. I don't know how to keep a tally of the sun. What do you? How do you, what do you even know about that language? I don't know. - What language? - The language of the sun. I'm not. - What do you think I said? - I'm not fucking Leonard da Vinci, dude. I don't know about that shit. - Let's just, okay, let's do this, I still need to slowly work you into my life, right. Well, I can't have it all at once, okay, you understand that? But I understand that's tough for you. So how about this? I give you seven days, just me and you. Hey, 10 days, I'll give you 10 days, just me and you, okay. - When does the 10 days start? - It starts right now. I just lied to my wife that I have a job in the mountains. And so here's my plan, we take the money that we want playing poker, we put into a cabin for 10 days. And then after that, we can start in the plan of working you slowly into my life, but not all at once, okay. Does that sound like a good plan? - I don't know, man. - Isn't this exactly what you want? - You locked me in a fucking car, like a goddamn dog all night long, dude. - Well, can't you just sleep or something? - No, Clay, I can't sleep, man. I can't eat, I can't jackoff, I can't do any of the stuff that feels good. - Well, I'm sorry. - For what? - I mean, don't let me go into, just your whole situation. Let's not get into specifics here. I'm sorry about everything that you're going through, okay. - Okay, cool, let's go. See the snow, that's cool. - I didn't really didn't think it was gonna be snowing up here. It's cold as a dog though. - Kinda rocks. - Yeah. Hey, remember when that guy was beating my ass. - Dude, yeah. I can't forget that. - And remember when he got sucked off me at the end, remember that? - No. - What? - You don't remember that you don't remember the guy getting violently yo inked off me at the end of the fight? - No. How do you remember that? Well, are you suggesting that I did that? - No, I'm just wondering if you remember the same thing I remember. I remember it getting beaten up and having the guy sucked off me. - That's because probably you're all heated and in the moment, and you probably don't really know what's going on, 'cause how heightened everything is. I bet you just hit him and then he ran away. You know, you don't know. - Well, remember that one time I kicked you outta my house and you stood up in anger and a plate magically flew off my counter. - Dude, that's not because of me, that's because of Lenny. Lenny got spooked because Lenny can see me. So when I stood up. - Lenny wasn't even there. - It scared Lenny. No Lenny was there. - Okay I don't remember. - I'm telling you, Lenny can see me. I had an idea for something we could do with your hair. - Get a haircut? - No. So once I had a really bad haircut. And then. - This bad? - I mean, you know, close, and I was shooting something, right, I was on set. So this guy, the makeup guy or a hair guy or whatever, he said, we should just bleach it and make it look like more purposeful. Like if you just kind of doubled down on a bad situation, it makes things better somehow so, maybe that's what we do with your hair. - It's not a bad idea. I feel like it would work. - Hey, look at that view. - Oh wow, what the hell? - I get why people wanna leave California, but it's so pretty and like so close to L.A. - Why do people wanna leave California? - Because of taxes or something, that's what I read. - Where do you read that? - I heard it on the Joe Rogan podcast. - Joe Rogan? Did dying give you brain damage, why you listening to that? - I like Joe Rogan. I think he's funny. This is nice. -  Yeah. I wish there was more snow. There's like snow where there's no view. But like when there's a view, there's no snow. - Yeah, what do you think that's all about? - I think it's the sun hitting this side and melting all the snow. - Yeah, I guess there's no way to really know. - Well, I think of what I just said was. Okay, you wanna take a photo right there? -  Oh yeah. -  Okay, point. All right, got it. Whoa, watch yourself, man. -  Stepped in a hole. -  I saw. You wanna go back. -  Yeah. Even if I fell through that hole and I fell into the center of the earth, I wouldn't die. - But you were still scared. - Yeah, isn't that weird? It's like, I'm afraid of dying, but I'm already dead, so why am I afraid? - When do you think it's gonna wear off? -  I don't know. It's kind of a spooky thought. You know what's a really spooky thought? - What? - That Chucky doll. Oh, I was thinking about what if him and Freddy Krueger had to have dinner together. Think about all the messed up things they'd talk about. - I wouldn't want to be in the table next to that. I'd have nightmares. You're not gonna believe this, absolutely will not believe this. Guess what they had. - You see that guy? - Do I see who? - Do you see that guy right there? - Yeah, I see him. Guess what they had, you're not gonna believe this. - What? - Guess. They had hair bleach, isn't that crazy? A gas station having hair bleach, have you ever heard of that? That's so crazy. Yeah, I got it though. Isn't it crazy. Wait, why did I close the door? Okay. All right. Dude, it's cold as a dog out there. Ready to go? - Thank you. - Okay, you ready? Oh, look at this, what the hell? Just, this is great. This is like the first time a place has been better than it's photos. Who's taking these photos? This is amazing. What the, I thought this place was gonna be a dump. You know what this place reminds me of reminds me of? It reminds me of something vintage or like old. I guess that's the same thing. I don't know what I mean by that. Okay, what is this? - What is that? - "Welcome to Horse Heaven." Is that what they call this place? "Instruction for the cabin. "Make sure both sets of keys are placed "in the back of the key box before leaving." Okay, I could do that. "First aid, flashlight and lantern in the kitchen drawer." Okay, I guess it's just one of those. "This is normally a family cabin. "A lot of the horse trinkets are exact replicas "of our beloved horses. "Most notably Mr. Blueberry on the living room credenza." What the hell? So be careful around that. "These are extremely precious items to us, "so please treat our belongings with the utmost respect." Okay, gotcha, I can do that. You think this place has a bathtub? I would love to take a bath right now. If they care so much about Mr. Blueberry, why'd they leave him behind? - I don't know. Yeah, they get a bathtub. I'm taking a bath. Okay, where's my stuff. Oh wait, I didn't bring my stuff in, stupid. What's up pal? - Hey, dude. - Are you good? - I'm good. I really appreciate that we get to spend this time together. - Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too. - I guess I just got a lot going on right now, you know. - Yeah man, I get it. It's. - I mean you don't but. - No, I mean like I, sorry, I understand that you're going through a lot and then, but also like I'm going through a lot, but I think right now, I think we need to look on the bright side of things. Like you have someone to talk to, which is really good. But I guess what I'm trying to say is I understand. - Don't say that. - What's that? - Don't say that you understand. You have no fucking clue about me or what I'm going through. So don't say that you understand. -  What is going on man? I'm getting the fuck outta here. - Clay. - No, stay away from me dude, you're freaking me out out. Ow God dammit. Fuck. You're freaking me out, dude. - Why? - Because you just turned the power off with your weird powers, dude. - I did not do that, man. - Yes, you did, dude. How else did it happen? - I don't know, maybe a critter chewed on a cord man, a lot of things could happen. - No, every time you get angry, something fucking weird happens. Like the time the plate crashed down my kitchen, the power just now and that one time that guy got sucked off in the alley. - I don't know how I did that. - So you admit it, you admit that you sucked the guy off? - No, I, yes, no, I mean, I admit that the three of us went into the alleyway and that guy got sucked off. I don't know how it happened, I don't know who did it, but yes, it did happen. But you gotta admit on the scale of scary shit that's going on right now, this isn't that bad. - It's really bad, dude. It's so fucking scary, man. - I don't think you're actually scared. - I'm spooked as hell. - I think you're making it all up. I think you are using being scared as an excuse to bail on me. I'm the one that's scared. Do you know what it's like being me? I could end up a ghost on the side of the freeway for the rest of my life, or whatever that means. That's scary. If you were really scared, you would've just run off into the woods just now. - No, it would hurt my feet, I need to get my shoes, okay. - Well, okay, fine, then you would've gotten in your car, you would've driven away, you wouldn't have left the door opened, you sure as hell wouldn't have grabbed your hoodie on the way out. - It's like fucking 10 below out here, dude. I don't wanna freeze. - I just, I hate that you think I'm scary, man. I'm not scary, I'm your pal. - Okay. I'll admit that maybe I have some trust issues, okay. And just friend issues in general. But you have to admit, man, you do fucking spooky shit all the time and I just don't know how to respond, okay. Can you admit that? - Yes, deal, I admit it. It's just embarrassing, dude. It's embarrassing that I can't control this shit. I'm sorry. Like I want to be just like pals again, you know, I just want to like hang out or whatever. I don't want you to be afraid of me. Let's go back inside. Let's try to figure out how to turn the lights on. - Okay. Yeah, no, hi, so I turned the breaker back on, but I'm curious if there's like a security system I need to reset or anything. No. That's, okay. - Just hang up. - No, everything's fine. It's just the thing that I. - Dude, just hang up. -  My fucking horses. No, I. - They got Mr. Blueberry. - Click. - She's getting wilder. - Yeah, just hang up. - Okay, sorry, I'm just, okay sorry. Okay, thank you. - What'd she say? - I don't know something about a horse, I don't. What do you wanna do? Wanna bleach my hair. In heaven Nothing will matter Anymore Not in a bad way Like before 'Cause we'll be sure that we're in heaven Where the time moves so fast The things we like always last 'Cause that's how it is in heaven And those years spent in uncertainty And fear were all a joke We'll just look back and laugh about it, ha On the white horse - You okay up there, pal? Oh, you okay? I got bad news for you, dude. - What's that? - Mr. Blueberries broken. - What, how'd that happen? - I don't know. I think you were karate kicking all over the house. - I karate kicked that down? - Maybe, I don't know. Did you see all the karate kicks you were doing earlier? -  Yeah, I remember that. I don't remember kicking Blueberry. - Well, Blueberry's broken, right on the ground right there. Where are you going? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, cool. -  Goes off. - Are you sure you feeling okay? - No, I'm not feeling good, I feel drunk and I feel like I'm gonna throw up. You understand? - Okay. - Okay, so I'm gonna go sleep, okay. - Okay. - You understand me? - I understand, stop doing that. - I'll leave the door open for you. - You don't gotta do that, man, it's cold. Well, thank you. -  Okay. - Thanks pal. Hey dude. - Oh, what's up? - Thanks for leaving the door open all night. - Oh yeah, for sure. Man, last night was, ass wild. Yeah. - Your hair looks really cool. - Thanks man. Yeah, I didn't think it was gonna turn out so blonde, but it just, I like it. - Yeah it's good. - I really do. - Yeah. Hey, there's something I gotta tell you, dude. It's stupid, but I just need to get it off my chest. I've been thinking about it all night. - Yeah? - I know how I died. I lied to you. I'm not a successful actor with unreleased projects. - Really? - I was just always really cool man in high school, like after we stopped hanging out, I was killing it. Everybody thought I was so funny. People were always telling me that I was gonna do cool shit. And then we graduated and I did nothing, I just floundered. And I became aware of that. So I decided to save some money up and move out here to be an actor. But it's fucking hard out here, man. It's fucking so competitive, I couldn't even get a job as a waiter, 'cause everybody working there looked like a goddamn gossip girl. - Right. - And so I was going broke and I didn't know what else to do, so I decided I would just play Joker on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame in front of Grauman's. I was doing Heath Ledger's Joker. And you know, I'm really good at it. So there was always a ton of people lined up to take photos with me, like loads of people whose days that I was brightening with my talent. And it was making me happy for a sec, but I was still so lonely man. Like I didn't have any friends. None of the other actors on Hollywood Boulevard would hang out with me. They were all so jealous. Anyway, I was taking my makeup off by my car one night and I realized that I had been being followed. It was Pennywise and Deadpool. And I don't know why they're there, I don't know if they were there to rob me or just scare the hell outta me, but. They beat the fuck outta me, man. They wouldn't stop, just taking turns, kicking me and punching me. The last thing I remember is Deadpool, raising a crowbar over his head. I guess he smacked the fuck outta me, left me there to die. - Stop, you don't have to. Okay, please don't go into detail, right. Listen, I'm so sorry what you went through. And honestly, I should have checked in with you, I should have called you, I should have even texted you once and I didn't and I'm sorry, okay. So I know none of this is really on me, but I think some of it I need to take blame for. And I'm sorry. - Well, I'm not saying any of this so that you'll apologize or anything like that, that's not why I'm saying this, man. I'm just saying this because I'm a grown up and the way that I acted is unforgivable. And I promise I will never do anything like that again. I'll never haunt you. I'll never do anything like that again. I'm so grateful that you're my friend, dude. Like, I'm so lucky that I'm stuck with you. And I think that if we just continue to communicate with each other like this, then we're gonna be cool. 'Cause we'll know how we're feeling . And then I can just, you know, keep haunting you forever until I go to heaven or until you die. And then we get to haunt the world together, man. I'm just, I'm really lucky, dude, I'm really lucky that you're my friend and that I get to haunt you and not some dickhead back home. - I mean dude, I mean, you're being honest, thank you. I just don't know what to say, I really don't. - It's fine. - But hey, I'm so glad that you opened up like this. I think we need to be more honest, you're right. So I think here on out we can. - Right. - Yeah. - Cool. - So. - What you got going on up there? - Oh, this will remember Mr. Blueberry from last night? - Oh yeah, you gonna tell the owner you broke it? - Oh, absolutely not. Yeah, the goal here is not to talk to them ever again. So what I did was I took Mr. Blueberry, wrapped him up and I put him in the attic. And if they ever realized Mr blueberry's gone, I could tell 'em but until then I'm not talking to nobody. So, just. - Good plan. - Yeah. I just don't know if I hid it well enough. - What's it like up there? - I don't know, it's like an attic, wood beams, that little foam stuff. Yeah, so, I don't know. I think I need to like find something to put in front of it. It's just up there. - Yeah, I don't know, so. - I mean, if you wanna go up there, you can. It's just, I don't know if I did a good job hiding it. - Whoa. It's cool up here man. Yeah. I mean it's hidden, a little bit, I guess. I don't know why you would really wanna hide it though. Clay. Clay man, this isn't funny dude. Please Clay, let me outta here, man. Please Clay, come on, man let me outta here. I'm freaking out, Clay come on. I'm sorry Clay, I'm sorry dude. You'll never have to see me again. Clay, just let me outta here, man, please. Please Clay. Please don't leave, Clay. Don't leave me out here, man. Dot leave me, Clay, please don't leave me. I'm sorry Clay, please. Don't leave me, Clay. I'm sorry man, please. Clay, please man. Something follows you back from the other side From the locked up basement at the house of blue light Close your eyes and you'll fall right through the floor There are things in this world that are real As your life but you're taught to ignore All the strength that waits at your side On the wings that heave and they sigh Painted in the corner of your eye Where once there were halls and gardens Where captains' wives would bathe And tattoo the names of sailors lost to the waves But nobody lives there anymore In the castle in the clouds Nobody lives there anymore In the castle in the clouds They'll leave you pounding on the door
