Why is the FDA interested in a fatal truck crash in Nevada? Is that what you're wondering? Mhmm. Well the Interstate Commerce Commission, Proctor's outfit, brought us in when they found these on Owens after the smash up. We ran a lab test... amphetamine sulphate. For short? OK, they're Bennys, stay awake pills. The truck drivers call them co-pilots. And Owens got these illegally? The law says that on a doctor's prescription only. But Owens hadn't been to see a doctor in years. Bootleg Bennys are for sale in gas stations, all night cafes, hundreds of public places. Why, we've been told they're as easy to buy as cigarettes or chewing gum. So our department's supposed to find out where he got them, huh? More than that. Owens isn't the first truck driver those babies have killed. Of course we're interested in knowing who's pushing the pills. But the main thing is to spot the source. Mm. Have to be somebody with good connections in the drug field. That's right. The big pharmaceutical companies want to cooperate. But so far they haven't been able to turn up a thing. You see, there are more than 150 processors in the business. Our guess is that last year, close to 900 million happy pills were turned out. 900 million? You begin to see our problem? There's no telling how many truck drivers are addicted to the use of these pills. And it doesn't take too long before they start seeing things, or going out of their minds completely. Well, what's our method of operation, chief? I'm sending men to six locales to sign up as a student truck drivers. The Motor Truck Association is giving us 100% cooperation. They have more than 4,000 member companies throughout the country. So getting the job will be no problem. You go to Los Angeles. Lennie Owens's hometown. And if the ICC can help in any way, give me a call. Good luck. Thank you, sir. We'll keep you posted. So long, Frank. Now take this slowly. Play it by ear. Take your time getting established. Have you, uh, figured out your identity? Well, let' see. Ought to be something simple. I'm Tom Kaylor, a guy from, let's say, Indianapolis. A drifter with loose ends ever since my wife died. That ought to cover a lot of questions that might come up. Sounds good. Lennie Owens's widow, she runs a rooming house mostly for truck drivers. Good luck. Thanks chief. And be careful. This is a million-dollar racket. One human life doesn't mean much to these operators. I'll contact you as soon as I'm settled. Yes? They told me down at the truck terminal that I could get a room here. Come in. You a truck driver? Well, I'm a student driver. I'm gonna be. I have a nice single. Mink? Mink! Well, hello. Hello. Mink, that music. Couldn't resist it, huh? There are people trying to sleep. Zombies. They spend their crummy lives in the sack. I ask you, what's so great about sleep? Some of the very best people do it. Who's your sharp friend, Val? The gentleman was interested in a room. Oh, a sucker, and I'm lousing up the pitch. See, quiet, like a library. You can even hear the termites. This is the room. Nice. I ask $8 a week. I'll take it. Fine, Mr... uh? Kaylor. Tom Kaylor. I'm Mrs. Owens, Valerie Owens. How do you do? Well, I, I guess you'd like some money. A week in advance is usual. There. Thanks. The bath's around the corner, the first door on the left. You share it with other men. I'll bring up some towels and some wash rags later. All right. You, uh, stranger in Los Angeles, Mr. Kaylor? Just got in this morning. Got a job already, huh? Boomer Freight Lines. Well, I, I hope you like it here. Oh, I think I will. I've had my fill of drifting. I'm ready to settle into something a little more permanent. You didn't pick the easiest life. My husband was a truck driver. I know. Well, uh, if there's anything that I can do to help you, you just let me know, hmm? Thanks. Oh, and if Mink gets to loud, you have my permission to throttle him. Hey, cat, welcome to the fraternity. Mink Reynolds. Tom Kaylor. Yeah, Val told me. Hear you want to jockey the big ones. Well, I'm going to try. Hey, nothing to it. I'm heading for the terminal now. Give you a lift? Yeah, that'll be swell. Let's roll, man. Classy piece of junk, huh? Yeah, I noticed it when I came in. That is one thing about Baby and Mink. You may not like us, but you can't ignore us. Anxious to get started, Tom? Aw, you bet. How long will we be out? Oh, I figured about 45 in this haul. 20 out, 20 in, and a five hour layover. Oh! Hey Shug, take it easy. You OK Shug? I'm OK. Big lug took me my first haul, 18 years ago. Why'd he quit? Shug's got his problems. So, they teamed you up with old dad, huh? Well, if you're not back in a week or so, we'll send out a search party. Are you taking out another hold? Boise, dad, with time out in Reno. Crazy. You're pressing your luck, lad. You need sleep. I'm in demand. Don't take him too serious. He was great with a horse and buggy. But now... You listen. What little you know about [INAUDIBLE] a rig, I taught you. OK, [INAUDIBLE]. You save it for my refresher course, huh? Maybe see you at [INAUDIBLE]. Right. Thinks he's got the world at the tail. One way or the other, he's got... Hey, Shug, look out. Get away from me! I'll kill you. So help me! I'll kill you! What happened? He just swung at me, Wally, no reason at all. Stay away from me, all of you. Stay away from me. I'll kill you. [INAUDIBLE], Shug. No closer. I don't want to hurt you, Wally. No closer. Shug, you're sick. You're lying to me. Everybody lies to me! Hey, what's happened to old Shug? I don't know. He just keeled over. Man, he looks cold. He's dead. I'll take that, son. Has he been sick? Yeah, real sick. That works. Need a drink, Tom? No, thanks. Won't be stopping again for a while. Well, if it ain't the Kookamunga Cannonball. Hi. Hello, Wally. Meet my new relief, Tom Kaylor, Dunc Clayton. Hi, Tom. Glad to meet you. Hi. Another good man gone wrong. Don't let him needle you, Tom. He used to be a driver. Sure, until I got smart. Eh, soft, you mean. Well, I'd probably still be driving if it weren't for Jane, my wife. She's not partial to truck drivers. Aren't you guys on a Portland push? Yeah. Running a little late, aren't you? Trouble. Shug Grandon died. Old Shug? Went loco. Started throwing his freight hook around. Tom and I got it away from him. Stumbled back. Let out a yell, and dropped. When I got to him, he was dead. Same old trouble, I guess. Yeah. Always said it would kill him. Everything's OK, Wally. Shug and Wally and I started together when we were just kids, old Shug. All set, Tom. Nice meeting you. Yeah. Say, Wally, I'll check with Shug's misses to see if there's anything we can do. I know he didn't have much insurance. Whatever you decide, count me in. Don't chase any jackrabbits. Why don't you crawl back in the bunk, and get some shut eye. No, I'm not tired. I keep thinking about that poor guy today. What really happened to Shug, Wally? Well, I guess as long as you're going to be pushing a rig, you might as well know about Benny. Benny? Yeah, Benny, the truck driver's friend. Those little pills in that envelope you picked up, the things that killed Shug. Stay awake pills? Well, I've heard about them. But I didn't think they could kill anybody. Listen, Tom. Shug is one of the best drivers that ever pushed a rig down the pike. He got dependent more and more on Benny. First he had a couple of close calls. Then he wrecked a brand new rig. The company blackballed him. He was washed up as a driver. That's why he was working as a handler, huh? Yeah. Still couldn't shake Benny. He was taking maybe one an hour. Doctor told him that sooner or later it would kill him. You were there. I thought you had to have a prescription to get those things. Heh. You can get a fistfull of happy pills easier than you can get a beer. Don't even need any dough. Don't even have to show you're 21. And a lot the guys use them, huh? You staying over at Val Owens's? Yeah. Lennie, her husband, swell guy. Got himself loaded up on co-pilots. Ended up in a Reno morgue. If the guys see these things happening, why do they keep on taking them? You tell yourself, once in a while won't make any difference. I'm not like Shug or Lennie. I could never really get the habit. You too, Wally? For emergencies. Well go on, say it. Say I'm nuts! Wait until you've been pushing one of these rigs as long as I have. Wait until you've clocked up 18 years moving one of these smelly hearses. 18 years of trying to stay awake when everyone, everything's asleep. Maybe you'd be glad to have Benny for company, too, kid. Maybe. Get some sleep. That's an order. All right, Wally. Hi, Wally. Hi. Hi, you no-good road jockeys. Meet our new fraternity brother, Tom Kaylor. Hey, how'd you guys get here so fast? Somebody give you a push? Hiya, lively boy. Did [INAUDIBLE] teach you what that accelerator's for, Wally? Hey, Amy, how about... Later, Mink. I'm busy. Let's not postpone destiny. Hey, what's the matter, kid. You're dragging your feet. Put me down. Nice [INAUDIBLE], Amy. Ooh, that Mink. I bring out the worst in everybody, secret of my success. What'll it be, Wally? Cup of joe, and a piece of apple pie. Hey, uh, Tom Kaylor, Amy Phillips. Hi. Hello. The thought of seeing Amy against is all that keeps most of us going. Mink. Ms. Diesel, 1958. Some coffee for me, please. Hey, Amy, the kid looks a little tired. Why don't you give him one of your side orders? Just a little [INAUDIBLE] on the side, and you start wheeling and dealing. Shut up, Mink. Just shut up. That girl is crazy about me. They all are, Mink. They all are. Be right back. Hey kid, you do look a little bleary. Long way to Portland. You met Benny? Benny? Oh yes, sure. We're old friends. Well, you ever need a refill, ask Amy for a side order. Side order? You mean the guy who runs this place pushes pills? No, no. Not [INAUDIBLE]. This is strictly Amy's idea. A dandy, huh? Well, kid, this ain't getting me to Boise. Take it easy, Mink. Don't know the word, cat. Hey, [INAUDIBLE], give me a clearance [INAUDIBLE]. I'm [INAUDIBLE]. One man riot decided to [INAUDIBLE] huh? Yeah. This your first run? I just signed on today. Congratulations. Oh, I don't think you mean that. Mister, any time I get to feeling sorry for myself working nights in this place, I think it could be worse. I could be driving a truck. Yeah, I guess fighting sleep is the worst part of it. Amy, if I wanted a side order, your specialty, how much would it cost me? What's on the menu, that's all you get here. No, no. It's all right. Mink told me. I don't care what Mink told you. You're a fool if you listen to him about me, about anything. I'm sorry. I just thought maybe I could... If its not on the menu, I don't serve it. Hey, hey, what's the trouble here? It's Mink's fault. Mink started it. Mink's so good at starting things. Oh, listen, Amy, I'm sure that Tom didn't mean anything. Oh, forget it, Wally. Hey, what did you say to Amy? I got the wrong impression from Mink, that's all. This I can believe. Next time check with me first. Sorry about that little flare up with Amy. You're not sore at me, are you, Wally? Nah. Why should I be sore? You just listened to that loudmouth Mink. He gave you the wrong impression. Amy's a sweet kid, friendly gal. But that's all. Yeah, Mink was just talking to hear his head roar, I guess. You take my advice. Don't let Mink Reynolds talk you into anything, anything. Learned the hard way. As a matter of fact, Tom, I wasn't even thinking about your little ruckus. I've been think about poor old Shug today, and what you said. It hit me right where I live. It set me thinking about all those other guys I know with their kids at home, and them all the time riding with Benny, risking everything on the hope that crummy little pill will see them through. Rotten [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, sure seems like something could be done. Even a nice kid like Amy, she takes Bennys. I've seen her when she didn't think anyone was watching. Somebody must be getting fat off of people like Shug, and Amy, and Mink. And me. They've got more than one buck of my hard-earned dough. That's smart, huh, paying them for something that will kill you or put you in the loony bin. Yeah. Got any idea who's pushing these things, who's making a fast buck? I run into something once. But I didn't follow through. I figured live and let live, you know. What happened to Shug shouldn't happen to anybody else. Are you going to the police with what you know? No. What little evidence I've got is not enough. I'll just poke around, see what I can turn up on my own. It's the least I can do for Shug. Well, you need any help, let me know. Thanks, Tom. I'll let you know. Better be pretty careful while you're poking around, Wally. If you get too close, these characters might get rough. Don't worry. I'll leave the rough stuff to the police. I had a grandfather that lived to be the ripe old age of 91. I'm after the family record. Now get plenty of sleep. I'll see you Thursday at 3:00. Right. Remember, if you need somebody to play Dr. Watson to your Sherlock Holmes, let me know. I'll remember. Go on, now. Be careful, Wally. Mr. Kaylor. Oh hi, Mrs. Owens. Steve Hummel, Tom Kaylor. How are you? Nice to meet you. How was your first run? Oh, I feel like I'm still in the cab. Have some coffee. Well, fine. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh, no. I should have left over an hour ago. Val, you sure you won't change your mind, and come back with me? Tell Marge thanks. But I'm getting along fine here, Steve. She's going to be real disappointed. Try to make her understand it. It's not that I don't appreciate the invitation. It's just... Well, next trip maybe I can bring Margie along, and you two can have a real visit. I'd like that. Well, see you in a couple weeks. Glad to meet you. Same here. Goodbye. Bye, Steve. Steve's been so wonderful. He's married to my oldest friend. And they've been trying to get me to come to Sacramento and stay with them ever since Lennie... since my husband was killed. Well, you know it seems at a time like this everybody knows what's best for you. That's it exactly. And they're all so nice about it. No, thanks. No, most people don't have any idea what it's really like. You speak from experience? My wife died a little over a year ago, heart. She had rheumatic fever when she was a kid. Married long? Almost five years. Would have been eight for Lennie and me. Isn't it strange what you miss? Lennie never turned out a light in his life. I used to get so sore at him. That's what I miss. I never walk into an empty room anymore and find a light burning. How did it happen? They said he must have fallen asleep at the wheel, pushing himself too hard. Nothing ever broke right for Leonard. It wasn't that he was lazy or dumb. Nobody ever worked any harder. But there was never any payoff for him until his insurance check. Oh, you're just marking time with this truck driving, aren't you? I needed a job. It's a job. Hmm. Something you can do without putting too much of yourself into it. Running in one place while you catch your breath for the next sprint. You're very observant. Well, leave for a hot shower and 12 hours' sleep. Thanks for the coffee. Well, I hope it doesn't keep you awake. Oh, nothing could. Good night. Night. How's the boy truck driver? Hi, Mink. Into your play clothes, kid. We've got a large evening ahead. Oh, not me. What do you mean? Listen, I've got us a couple of live ones. Man, Mink, I'm dead. I'll take care of that. A couple of Bennys, and you'll feel no pain. You got any on you? I'll get them. That's no problem. I don't know. Well, all right. I won't group like this again. You're dead man, and you don't know it. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yeah, it sounds great. I just didn't want to slow you down. Oh, at ease, man. When you get a load of the dish I'm serving you, you may not need a Benny. Yeah, but if I do? Be my guest. 10 minutes? Right. Sleep. Who wants to waste time dreaming, when you can date the real McCoy? Hiya, Val. Hi. Change of plans? I'm uh, helping Mink out. Oh. Good night. Honestly, Hazel's just crazy about Mink. Who's to blame her? He's such a dreamy dancer, and funny. Did you ever hear anything like him in your whole life? Yeah, he's an original, all right. One laugh right after another. Of course, I don't mind a man if he's quiet, but just so he's not too quiet. I'm sorry Nancy. I'm afraid I'm not much good tonight. Hey, what's this, a seance? I'm afraid we're keeping Tom, up. Well, I warned you I was beat, Mink. I forgot. What old dad needs is a quick recharge. A couple of these, and watch out Nancy, honey. Where'd you get 'em? Connections. Let's keep uncle Tom company, cats. Happy days and happy nights. Ah! That'll rev up the old engine, huh? I'm going to give you a break, now, Nancy honey. OK. Hold Tom's hand until he gets that glow, babe. Hi, boss. Well, I figured one trip had finished you off. Well, you said three o'clock. OK, I said three o'clock. Why don't you get up in the cab, see if you remember anything I told you last trip. What's the matter, Wally? Aw, nothing. Are we going to ride this way for the next 48 hours? Can a guy have a headache without you making a federal case out of it? Sure, sure. I just wondered if you were sore about something I said or did. It's got nothing to do with you. Last trip, all that junk I talked about Bennys, about pusher was, forget it. Forget it? You heard me. Must have been punchy wanting to play private eye. Had the right idea before. Live and let live, you understand? Yeah. If you think you can handle it, Tom, I'll get some sleep. Sure, I'll manage. Tom? Hmm? I'm sorry. I had no right taking it out on you. It's just that when I got started poking around, I ran into something that shook me. It's all right, Wally. You don't owe me any explanations. Maybe not. But I shouldn't give you a bad time just because I got myself in a bind. Let's just make out like we never had that talk, huh? Sure, if that's the way you want it. It's not the way I want it. It's the way it has to be. I sure never thought I'd find myself caught in the middle. You look tired, Tom. Pull over. I'll take her into Six Points. All right. Oh! God! Help! Tom! Somebody call a doctor. It's too late for that. Call the police. Good night, Val. Don't go upstairs, please. I'd rather not be alone right now. You shouldn't have gone to Wally's funeral. I'll be alright. Just have dinner with me. Or... may-maybe you have other plans? No, no plans. More coffee? No. No more stimulants, please. It's been a wonderful evening, Tom. Mhmm. But, like all good things... You have to work tomorrow? Yeah. Mink and I are taking a rig out to Portland. First run for me since Wally died. You can't blame yourself, Tom. If only I hadn't been asleep when we stopped at Six Points. You'd have been killed too. Maybe. Maybe I could have done some. You can always find an if or a maybe to whip yourself with afterwards. But who does it help? Wally's dead. That can't be changed. Regrets are foolish. I know that, Val. But still you wonder. With Lennie I... I went over and over it. Why, why, why, why? Did you realize he was depending on those pills? I knew he took them sometimes. But all the drivers seem to. Blaming the pills is no answer, not for me. The way it seems to me, everything that happens to us in life is part of a bargain. And to get certain things, we lose others. There's no use crying over our losses. We just play along, and try and come out ahead. Sort of win heavy, lose heavy? Something like that. I know nothing good ever came to me that didn't cost me a lot. You think sometimes you can come out ahead? It's possible. I think I better go up. The dining room light. I must have forgotten. That's all right, Tom. Good night. Good night, Tom. Hope the company's got a lot of insurance, trusting you two cowboys with this rig. I'm the one who needs the insurance, dad, partnered with the jinx. Look what happened to Wally after two runs with the kid. Good thing I'm not superstitious. Aw, Mink don't mean anything. Yeah, well I wish he'd stop kidding about Wally. Sacramento cops still giving you trouble? No, I think they've given up. I went up to see Wally's wife and kids yesterday. Real rough. Dunc? Yeah? Look, I, uh, I had kind of a rough night last night. I'm going to need some co-pilots. Can you help me out? We don't handle that kind of merchandise here. Are you kidding? You need help in that department, talk to Mink, not me, you understand? All right. You don't have to get sore. If you take my advice, you'll bypass Benny. He's trouble, nothing but trouble. End of sermon? Break it up, cat. Let's roll. See you, Dunc. Hello, cats! Your favorite customer has returned. And he's ready. Oh, Tom. Hi. Where's Amy? Oh, she hasn't been feeling good lately. I told her to stay in and get some rest. She, uh, she lives here, doesn't she? Yeah, in one of our cabins. Which one? Look, I don't want you bothering Amy. Look, I've got a message for her. She doesn't have to let me in if she doesn't want to. Which cabin? Number four in the rear. Thanks. Mink. Mink! What did he want? To see Amy. He says he's got a message. She's got to go. We can't afford the kind of trouble she's going to make. She's got to clear out. All right. We don't have to settle it now. Yeah? Tom Kaylor. Please go away. Either I talk to you or I talk to the police. What did you mean about talking to the police? You must have a guilty conscience. I just don't want any trouble. You've already got trouble. If this is about Wally, you're wasting your time. He was nice to me. And I'm sorry he's dead. But that's all. No, that's not all. I think Wally was killed trying to cover for you. Cover what? He started out to expose this outfit that was dumping all the black market Bennys. And why would Wally get mixed up in that? Why? Because those pills had just killed one of his best friends. Because he hated what he saw them doing to the guys he worked with. Because he hated what he saw them doing to you, Amy. He must have been crazy to think he could do anything. He got close, too close. Did he tell you all this? He name names? No. No, he quit. He was covering for someone. But he'd gone too far. How do you figure in this, anyway? What's your percentage? No percentage, Amy. I liked Wally. I don't like being accused of killing him. Well then why didn't you tell the police all this about Wally. Because they wouldn't have believed me. And maybe because I thought enough of you to give you a break. I didn't have anything to do with what happened to Wally. No? You told the others he was snooping around, getting too close. No, I never guessed he was. Even if I had, I'd have never told them. Told who? Nobody. Don't lie to me, Amy. You're as guilty of Wally's murder as the guys who beat him to death. No. Look, get out of here. Leave me alone. Not until I get some answers. I wish I was dead. Oh, how I wish I were dead! Now why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself. Why don't you try thinking about somebody else for a change, like Wally maybe, or his wife, or his kids. Now those guys you sell pills to every night, guys who end up under 15 tons of wrecked semi or frothing at the mouth on some violent ward... why don't you try thinking about them? Oh, don't you think I do. I haven't been able to sleep since Wally got killed. Every time I hear about a wreck, I wonder if it happened because of me, those pills. Well then why do you go on? I've tried to stop. It's like standing on the edge of a cliff all the time, scared and dizzy. Only the pills will make me feel steady and sure of myself. How in the name of heaven did you get started on them? So easy. Me and my mom, we had nobody else. So long as it was the two of us, it was OK. And when I was about 15, mom got real sick. I quit school, and went to work. What kind of a job can a kid 15 get? Doctor bills, and mom needed medicine. Just wasn't bringing home enough of money. There are places to get help, you know. Sure. Maybe I was crazy. I don't know. I wanted to be the one to help her, all by myself. So I got a second job. That's when you started on the pills? Just to keep going. It was just like taking an aspirin when you have a headache. When mom died I could have quit one of the jobs, but I didn't. I could have quit the pills, but I didn't. I never will. Sure you will, Amy, with help. Look, you think Wally got killed trying to help me. You want to get killed, too? Just tell me what you know. I'll take care of myself. Who supplies you with the pills, Amy? Amy? Look, I'd like to help you. But I... Well then tell me, please. Let me think it over, will you? Time's important, Amy. Look, there will be protection for you. I promise. He'll be coming through here tomorrow. - I'll talk to you then. - Why wait? All I want is names. 30 seconds will do it. Tomorrow. All right, tomorrow. You're really letting this baby out, dad. Look who's talking. Oh, me, I was born in a hurry. But I had you figured for the slow and cautious type. Well, I never believe in rushing unless there's a good reason, Mink. Yeah. For this trip you got a good reason, eh? Your reason couldn't be a certain cute little waitress at Six Points, now could it? You'd make a great detective. Yeah, so we're burning up the pavement just so you can have a little extra time with Amy Phillips. Dad, you're human after all. Got a yen for Amy, huh? Yeah, I got to admit it. I've been thinking of nothing but seeing Amy again this whole trip. Don't you have any idea where she might have gone? Just went off without a word. Had a week's salary coming, too. We figured you'd know where she'd gone, and why. No. What about her friends? She didn't have any. Now look, Mr. Overton, there must be somebody who knows. Look, mister. Amy Phillips is gone. Far as I'm concerned, she's forgotten. That sounds pretty convenient. If she hadn't run off, I meant to fire her. Why? That's my business. And remember this, I've broken no laws, unless they passed one against feeling sorry for someone who's sick. It can be illegal to spread sickness, you know. Yeah, I know. And that's just why Amy Phillips couldn't have stayed on. Now I've said all I mean to. If you want food, we'll serve you. Otherwise, there's the door. Mabel? Yeah? Could you make me a hamburger? Coming up. You better put onions on it... self defense. Val? Tom. Hi. I got a great idea. Let's go out to dinner, just the two of us, somewhere really good. And then maybe afterward we can go... Hello, Tom. Oh, hi, Steve. I thought I saw your car out in front. Tom, I love your idea. But, well, could we make it another night? Sure. Steve's come down to help me with my legal tangles. And we're having dinner with my lawyer. It's going to be a long session. Oh, next time I'll put in my bid a little earlier. Nice seeing you, Steve. Tom, I'm sorry to have spoiled it for you. That's all right. Good night, Val. Tom? Don't wait too long to ask me again. Don't worry. Man, all you need is a lily in your hand. Hey, why so sad, dad? You and the merry widow have a fight? Oh, save it, Mink. Oh touchy, touchy. We've missed you, dad, since you and Val started working crossword puzzles every night. Look, don't let me keep you from anything important. Look, Nancy's all the time asking when she's going to see you again. You really registered with that chick. What's your secret, man? Well, I don't talk much. It confuses them. Are you free tonight? Nancy will give you a big welcome back. No thanks. I got just the things that tired all over feeling. Come on. You eat those things like they were candy. Oh, much better than candy, dad. Now are you going to give Nancy a break? Not tonight. OK. Back in your coma. Now listen, don't forget we make the Portland run in the morning. At ease, dad. With Mink and Benny on the stick, the sky's the limit. Sweet dreams. Mink. Yeah? Did you ever meet Mrs. Hummel? Hummel? Oh, Val's friend from Sacramento. Yeah, she was around after Lennie was killed. Sharp looker. Why the interest in her? Oh, I don't know. Hummel seems to be around here a lot. You're jealous. You're jealous of Val. Oh, man, oh man, what a dark shade of green. Good night. Good night, Steve. Hi. Tom! You scared me. I'm sorry. It's awfully late. Yeah, well I couldn't sleep. My room was kind of stuffy. So... oh, who am I kidding. I had to see you. Val, I'm like a schoolboy. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't think about anything except you. How you look, how you feel in my arms. Don't talk, Tom. Don't talk. You're all set. Where's Mink? I don't know. If he doesn't show up pretty soon, you better report to the dispatcher. Yeah. There it is, my ship. On the gangplank. Avast, mate. Ready to sail? Mink are you crazy, bringing these people here? My friends come to wish me aloha, right? Right! All right. Come on. Get in. Hey, now who are you shoving? Mink. I'm taking the wheel. - Look... - I'm the captain. No mutinies. Let me get her started anyway, will you? You better get in, mate. I'm taking off. Aloha! Aloha. That's the old [INAUDIBLE] mate. Mink, you're so full of Bennys you couldn't ride a tricycle. You're not in any shape to drive this truck. Anchors away, daddy-o. Aloha. Aloha. Water, I want some water. You know where the fountain is. Oh no. I'm on to your sneaky tricks. Service. Can't a regular customer get a drink at this crummy place? All right, Larry. Get him a drink of water. Tom, you better humor him. I should have turned him into the dispatcher. He'll be all right as long as he doesn't run out of Bennys. Contact! What are you trying to prove, anyway? It's a secret between Benny and Mink. Look out! Pull over. No. I gotta make time. You almost hit that car head on. Plenty of room. Me and Benny saw it. That much room. Leave it to Benny and me. Water! Give me some water, Mabel. Got something for you, Tom. Huh? Mink, lay off, will you? Can't get along without my co-pilots. Ah. Oh, there's my favorite music box. We heard from her, too. Oh, I'm in a dancing mood. Hey, I'm in a dancing mood, I said. Come on, Mabel. Now you behave! Come on! Don't fight it, honey. It's bigger than both of us. Stop it. Mink, stop it. Leave me alone. Come on. You all right, Mink? Yeah, leave me alone. I'm OK. Get up, out of my place. All right. I'll get up. Come on. On your feet! Yeah, on my feet. - You all right, Mabel? - Oh, sure. - I'm all right. - You all right, honey? Yeah, I'm all right. But I can't understand it, what's got into Mink. I know he's always been loud. But this is some kind of crazy. Mabel don't want to dance, it's all right with me. The doll in Portland will dance 24 hours a day with me, 24 hours. Tom, make him stay here. I'll get a cabin ready. Oh, thanks. He'd never do it, Mabel. I'm sorry. You took my truck. Take it easy, Mink. Took my truck! Lie down. You're sick. I want to drive my truck! Oh, take it easy. All right, after you get some rest. The car! Look out for the car! There isn't any car, Mink! There's no car. We're going to crash! I can't breathe. I can't breathe! It's all right, Reynolds. Relax. A hospital? My arms, I can't move my... what's the idea? You were violent. Mr. Kaylor brought you in. We had no choice. Don't you remember anything, Mink? We have a riff? How many amphetamine pills had you taken before you blacked out? I don't know what you're talking about. Bennys, stay awakes, how many had you had? I, uh, I did have one or two of those, I guess. Two dozen is nearer the mark. You were full of amphetamine, enough to kill some men. What's this all about? So I got tired, blacked out. Listen to me. You ought to be in jail instead of this hospital. Jail? Because I took a few Bennys? No, because you tried to kill me. I tried to kill you? That's right. I don't remember that. You're a lucky man. You could be facing a murder charge. Yeah, you could be in the morgue yourself, killed by your old pal Benny. You better face it, Reynolds. You're an addict. Now I don't want to worry you. But Unless you get medical help, these pills are going to kill you. Kill me? I never thought no more of taking a B-Benny than taking an aspirin. Doc, what should I do? Well, if you really want to help, you can stay here for a week or so. We'll see how you get along. Tom, I'm sorry. How about the truck, the load? I delivered them. I'm on my way back to LA now. I'll try to cover for you. Thanks. Mink, Mink, who'd you buy the stuff from? Look, what's it matter? I'm, I'm through with it, honest. If it can make a guy kill... Look, you're through with it because you had a bad scare, and came out lucky. How about all the guys who won't come out lucky? I don't like to sing on anyone. That's a sick kind of loyalty, Mink, protecting the guy who sells you poison. Now look, I don't want to get rough with you. But if I have to... OK, Dunc Latham. Dunc? We tried and tried to make a buy from Dunc, never got any place. He don't risk selling a buck's worth. He keeps the place clean for bigger marks. Sure, Dunc and Wally Morris were good friends. Dunc's a nice guy. He's plain goofy about his wife. She's a real fancy spender. That's why he got hooked in this racket. Jails are full of nice guys like Dunc. The excuses they've got would break your heart. So long, Mink. Thanks. I'd like to help Mink out of his jam. But I don't know. I'm not asking you to lend us the money that Mink needs. This is a business proposition. We buy the merchandise from you. I sell it to my contact. And Mink's got the dough he needs to get out of his jam. This trouble that Mink's in... It's nothing that some quick cash won't settle. How many pills can you handle? 100,000. You got a cash buyer for that many? Mhmm. How much will it cost me? Well, I, I'd have to check. Well, maybe a nickel a piece. That would be $5,000. My party will pay $7,500. I make a quick $2,500. When can I have an answer? I don't know. A buy this big... We can't wait. Look, Dunc, he wants to work with you. But if you won't play ball, he figures there are people who'd like to know about this little side line of yours. OK, OK. I didn't say I wouldn't play ball. You free tomorrow afternoon? Mhmm. I'm through at 4:00. Meet me here. 4:00 tomorrow. I could figure a guy like Mink for this. But somehow I had you pegged different. Well, you just never know, Dunc. See you tomorrow. Steve? Steve? Val? Hi. Well, now what kind of a welcome is that? What's the matter? Nothing. I just got the brush off from Steve outside, and now I get the same thing from you. Oh, Steve's so upset he probably didn't even recognize you. What's his trouble? Business setback. Are you involved? He just wanted a shoulder to cry on. I admire his taste. I was worried. Weren't you due back earlier? Yeah, Mink got sick. Mink? Mhmm. Had to leave him in a hospital up North. Exhaustion, the doctor called it. So our playboy finally pays the piper, huh? He just needs rest. So do you. Mmm, not me. I've got plans for us. Tonight? Mhmm. We're going to do the town. Sounds like a celebration. Remember you once accused me of just marking time as a truck driver? Well, I'm through marking time. You mean you got another job? Mhmm. Don't tease, Tom. Tell me. I'll tell you. I got a lot of things to tell you. And I want the mood and the setting to be just right. Not even a hint? No, not even a hint. Give me half an hour. Val, honey. Change of plan. Amy's letter. It was so obvious I almost missed it. I did miss it. Of course, you're Mr. Brown, the big wheel with Sanborn Pharmaceutical who dealt with Amy Phillips. No wonder you were upset because questions were being asked today. I told you it was that waitress who talked. You were the one with the answers all along, weren't you? The ambitious woman married to the poor, hardworking slob who couldn't make anything pay off. Sweet. Dunc, good old Dunc, peddled poison to his friends, and set up Wally's murder. I didn't mean for Wally to get hurt. Just like I'm against what they're talking for you. Be quiet. Killing a federal cop. What's your answer? You got us into this, trusting that crazy Mink. Well, you're smart enough to know I'm not working alone. If anything happens to me... I've thought of that, and a way to cover it. Get started. I guess I'll go on home. No, Dunc. You're going with the others. With Hummel and Pason here, you don't need me. You're going, too. You sure there's nothing left in these rooms? Oh, you're not going with us? What's the matter, Val, got the trembles, like after Wally's funeral? Will you get him out of here? Oh, just repeat the magic formula, Val... win heavy, lose heavy. Dunc, you drive. Come on. Get in. Dunc, turn right here. Take him right up there. Dunc, give them a hand. I thought I'd sit here in the car and wait. You heard me. All right. Start digging. Digging what? A grave. Dunc? Yeah? You better make that two graves. Two? Sure. They've got to kill you. You're as dangerous to them as I am. I should have guessed. [INAUDIBLE] shut him up. Thanks, Dunc. Oh. Steve? Your turn to be surprised. Where's Steve? Men who know you, Val, all end up as bad insurance risks. Tom. I'm so glad you're all right. I, I never wanted you to be hurt. You know how I feel about you. I thought I did. Tom, it can still be you and me. Listen, how much do you make here, $7,500? I've got over 10 times that much in cash. Well, I'm glad for you, Val. Good lawyers come high. You mean you're going to turn me in? Oh. I, I don't want to go jail. I, I never meant it to go this far. S-Steve got me into it. It, it was all his idea. I was just so sick of never having any money. I thought this would be a chance to make a few dollars, that's all. All right. It was weak of me. It was foolish. But I never meant any real harm. I was just led into it, tricked. Save it for the jury, Val. Thanks, Val. The cure is complete. Oh! Take her in.
