I don't know. What do you want to eat, Al? - I don't know. I'll have a pork filet with apple sauce and mashed potatoes. The filet isn't ready yet. What the hell did you put it on the card for? That's the dinner. You can get that at 6:00. It's only 5:00. The clock says 20 minutes past 5:00. It's 20 minutes fast. Oh, to hell with the clock. What do you have? There's assorted sandwiches, eggs and bacon, eggs and ham, liver- Give me the chicken croquettes in cream sauce with green peas and mashed potatoes. That's the dinner. Everything we want's the dinner, eh? There's eggs and bacon, eggs and ham, liver and bacon, steak. I'll have eggs and ham. Eggs and bacon for me. Sam, eggs and ham, eggs and bacon. Got anything to drink? Soda, fruit juice, ginger ale. I mean you got anything to drink? Just those I said. This is a hot town. What do they call it? - Summit. - Ever hear of it, Max? No. What do you do here nights? They eat the dinner. They all come here and eat the big dinner. That's right. So you think that's right? Sure. You're a bright boy, aren't you? Sure. Well, you're not. Is he, Al? He's dumb. What's your name? Adams. Another bright boy. Ain't he, Max? The town's full of bright boys. - Which is yours? - Don't you remember? Eggs and ham. Just a bright boy. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. It wasn't on purpose, Max. You don't have to laugh. You don't have to laugh at all, see? All right. Have it your way. You hear, Al? He agrees to have it our way. That's a good one. - Oh, he's a thinker. What's the name of the one down the counter? Hey, friend. You go around on the other side of the counter. - What's the idea? - Go, go. Don't talk. What's the idea? None of your business. Who's out in the kitchen? The nigger cook. - Tell him to come in. - What's the idea? - Tell him to come in. - Where do you think you are? Don't worry. We know. Get into the kitchen and tell the nigger to come out here. What are you going to do to the nigger? Nothing. Use your head. What would we do to a nigger? Sam. Come here. What was it? All right, nigger. You stand right there. Yes, sir. I'm going back to the kitchen with the nigger and bright boy. Go on back to the kitchen, nigger. - Yes, sir. You go with him, bright boy. Well, bright boy, why don't you say something? What's it all about? Hey, Al, bright boy wants to know what it's all about. Why don't you tell him? What do you think it's all about? - I don't know. - What do you think? I couldn't say. Hey, Al, bright boy couldn't say what he thinks it's all about. Don't shout. I can hear you. Listen, you. Stand a little further along the bar. You move a little to the left, Max. Talk to me, bright boy. What do you think's going to happen? I'll tell you. We're going to kill a Swede. Do you know a big Swede named Ole Andreson? Yes. He comes here to eat every night? - Sometimes he comes here. - He comes here at 6:00? - If he comes. - We know all that. Talk about something else. Ever go to the movies? Once in a while. You ought to go to the movies more. The movies are fine for a bright boy like you. What are you going to kill Ole Andreson for? What did he ever do to you? Nothing. He's never even seen us. And he's only going to see us once. What are you going to kill him for, then? We were asked to. Just to oblige a friend. Shut up. You talk too goddamn much. Well, I got to keep bright boy amused. Don't I? You talk too damn much. I got mine tied up. They're amused by themselves. If anybody comes in, you tell them the cook left. And if they keep at it, you tell them you'll go back and cook yourself. Do you get that? What are you going to do with us afterward? That'll depend. That's one of those things you never know at the time. Hello, George. Can I get supper? The cook's gone out. He'll be back in a half an hour. I'd better go somewhere up the street. You're just a bright boy. Give me two liver sandwiches to go. Well, you're just a bright boy. He can do everything. He can cook and everything. Maybe. Five minutes. The cook's sick. Why the hell don't you get another? Aren't you running a lunch counter? Come on, Al. What about the two bright boys and the nigger? They're all right. You talk too much. So long, bright boy. You got a lot of luck. That's the truth. You ought to play the races, bright boy. Who is it? Mr. Andreson, someone's here to see you. It's me, Nick Adams. Come in. What was it? I was up at George's. Two fellows came in and tied up me and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you. They put us out in the kitchen. They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper. George thought I better come and tell you about it. There isn't anything I can do about it. Want me to tell you what they were like? I don't want to know what they were like. Thanks for coming to tell me about it. That's all right. Don't you want me to go to the police? No. That wouldn't do any good. Isn't there something I could do for you? No. There ain't anything to do. Maybe it was just a bluff. No. It ain't just a bluff. The only thing is, I just can't make up my mind to go out. I've been in here all day. Couldn't you get out of town? I'm through running away from them. There ain't anything to do now. Couldn't you fix it up some way? It's too late. There ain't anything to do. After I lie here a while, I'll make up my mind to go out. I better go back and see George. So long. Thanks for coming around. - Did you see Ole? - Yes. He's in his room and he won't go out. Did you tell him about it? Of course I told him. But he knows what it's all about. What's he going to do? Nothing. They'll kill him. Of course they'll kill him. It's a hell of a thing. It's an awful thing. What do you think he did? Double-crossed somebody. That's what they kill them for. I'm going to get out of this town. That's a good thing to do. I can't stand to think about him waiting in the room and knowing he's going to get it. It's awful to think about. You better not think about it.
