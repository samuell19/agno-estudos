I wish to take over the family business. My father's farm, and develop it into something more modern, adapted to our times. - A more productive farm. - That's it. More productive, so I need more cattle. And more equipment. Complying with European rules will cost around 175000 Euros, then there's the cost of the equipment, as well as various expenses, plus, taking over of my father's farm that already adds up to 400000 Euros. Ok, so a total of 575000. You realize this is a large sum. This would be a 15 year loan. Well, M. Lest, leave it all to me, I shall study the business plan, and I will get back to you. This loan is very important to me otherwise, I'll go out of business. I can't let down the family business. The land can be used as collateral. How many hectares? Very well, Mr. Lest. I'll get back to you. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. The Adviser PROJECT REFUSED PROJECT REFUSED Interesting client profile. Very keen on his project, good presentation... Credit track record? None. - Is the farm doing well? - It's profitable. Does he have any competition? Yes. It's a farming factory but, it's a well established family farm. And, it's well located. Next to the Nivelle highway junction. Which is far from being completed. I imagine, over 15 years, the value will increase. Yes, let's imagine. I don't know, I don't find farming sexy. In terms of risk management, 60 hectares, valued at 900000 Euros... Add the cattle, the equipment... Right, maybe. Mr. Lest! - Hello. - Hello. Sorry I'm late, I had an appointment. Everything ok with you? I'm well, thanks. Right. So, basically... I reviewed the financing plan, I did a new profitability analysis, as well as the economic environment, and I like it a lot. Very well put together, sound planning. I tried to do it properly. I also analyzed things more realistically, I should take things even further. Considering my young age... I should invest myself even more into this project. The time is right. What do you mean? Increase my production capacity, what I would need today, is to double my cattle. Double the number of animals. From 50 to 100 or 40 to 80. - Really? - Yes. How many liters would you produce? I would reach about 800000 liters per year. - Yes? - All in all. I find this idea excellent, Mr. Lest. This means you will increase your quotas. - Yes. - Better return on investment. - A what? - Faster return on investment. Yes. In my economic analysis, I thought, that if I bought that robot, costing about 125000 Euros, which might seem a lot, but this will increase every cow's performance. I'll know how much to give her depending on what she produces. I get it. So, in the long run, I'll get an easy return. On a total amount of 650000 Euros. Right, that's it. It's more ambitious, that should help. My father's land as a guarantee. Standard banking procedure. Right. I'll add this to the file, then I will forward it to headquarters, who will then make a decision, a positive one, I believe. You like the project? I think it's very good. If you say so. It that good with you, M Lest?- Yes. - Well, thank you. - I'll be in touch. Fine. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So, we said the rate was... 4 %. Reimbursement capacity? Established at 72000. Ok. Cash flow, 16500 Euros, so, 26500 Euros per semester. - How much does he bring? - 12 %. What's his back up, again? 60 hectares valued at 900000 Euros. What does the scoring say? No problem. Very happy, and waiting for the signature. You're very keen on this farmer. Ok fine. Put it through credit. Do a cross sell, while you're at it. The guy will need an insurance. - And don't forget... - Set up a pension. - Everybody speculates. - No. Everyone at different levels, but we all speculate, look, I'll give you a painting, when you leave my place, as a gift. I have two paintings, here. My grandmother's painting, which you said was nice. And there's a Picasso in the lobby it's quite ugly, you didn't notice it. Which one will you choose? The Picasso. See? You sacrifice your taste to earn money. Always. Earning from the goods that belong to us is different from making money with other people's money. The idea is that other people's money allows others materialize their projects. And you believe what you say? It's not about believing, it's a fact. You are making a profit off people's savings. At their expense. Well spotted. Actually, not. It's with their approval. Thanks. You are welcome, Mr. Lest. ...article 5, denunciation or immediate suspension, the bank has the right to terminate the loan without notice or justification effective immediately, on the remaining part of the loan. This means that in case of maintenance negligence or non-insurance of the goods, the bank may request immediate payback of the loan. And trigger a public auction. So, in terms of mortgage reimbursement priority list, the bank will be paid back, first. In Genappe, where the farm is located. the land, the greenhouse, the stables... And the pasture as well as the park. Total number of liters of milk... Here, each cow's daily production, here, which cow needs what, the computer works 24 hours a day. It's focused on the task, see? Look. And it tells me how much food I must give them every day. Every cow gets the right amount she needs to produce her milk. I want to reach 12 %. Deviate non-VIP clients to terminals, nothing goes through you, anymore. I want 30 % less, ok? The increase of credit cards in circulation and increase investment funds. A formidable increase. What others call crisis, I call business opportunity. No more overdrafts. Every decision must be made by me and only me. From now on, I validate everything. Get it? Without exception. Your clients are not your friends. Especially those who can't pay. We must be extremely rigorous with loans, especially recovering. We do things "American style", now. They don't get it? Who cares? We do. "CTRL-N. New Tab" I'm not going to hide it you've all heard about the 10% staff reduction. Next year, I want to work with you. A word to the wise... Enjoy your weekend, family, your kids, because on Monday, double espressos for everybody. Have a good weekend. Here's the situation. The bank is offering you a debt management policy. Ok? Smaller bi-annual installments over a longer period of time. This will give you a breather to get back on your feet. Against a partial sale of 10 hectares so you can release some cash flow. I've thought about this, my farm will be profitable in 2 or 3 years. Yes, maybe. But you don't have that time. Don't bother me for a couple of late payments. I don't think you realize you need funds now, you're heading for a wall. The price of milk has dropped... They go up and down, that's stock exchange stuff, I need some time, I have a long-term vision you're being short-term. 3 late payments, 18 months you owe 80000 Euros. The bank won't go any lower. So, either you sell 10 hectares and carry on working for 10 years, But, the bank can seize land at any time. I really must ask you to sign this. You think I'll sell my land? Just give it to you? I don't want it, you have no choice. My project is solid. I believe in it. Leave me a little time. No. Goodbye. I'll call you next week. Visual contact is one thing, what's important is physical contact. Bad first contact, lost contract. Shake my hand Are you selling potato-peelers? How can I trust you? I'll show you. Can you feel that? That's something else. - Christophe. - Hello. See that? I'll see you in my office. - A bit fat for his age. - Maybe not. One, I find very sexy is Mr. Van De Wilde. He's really my type. Have you ever screwed a client? No. Not that I can remember. Ask Christophe, he's good at screwing clients. Bankers are not sexy. - I think they are. - Me too. What we need is a good old-fashioned hold-up. Some emotion... But there's no more cash in banks. Sure there is. Soon, there will be only computers. No, you need people behind them. Let them through! That's it. Hello! May I talk to you? Hold on, I'm working. Try and grab one. That one! That's the one, don't move! That's the one! Move away! Watch out, there! There you go. Mr. Lest, what you are doing is pointless. Stay right there, that's good. No, stay there. You'll receive a letter from the bank, it's all over, do you understand? The farm must be repossessed. I'm sorry. Can we deal with this tomorrow? I can come over tomorrow. Right now, I... So, I'm sorry. Look at this mess. I'll come over tomorrow. What for? To go through the papers and stuff. I need more. I'll call you tomorrow. I need to buy more land, to expand. To fix the roof.
