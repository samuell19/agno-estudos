You must have heard and maybe even seen that right here in our town, there is a group of folks who have always followed their dreams and carry on the traditions of the Sichuan people. Let's give them a warm welcome and get ready to feel the power of Sichuan Opera. - A round of applause ! - Let's welcome them. TO LIVE TO SING One, two, three, jump ! Sweep ! Duck down. And again. - Why don't you jump instead ? - Jump ? - Like this. - Jump like this ? I'll sweep and then you jump. Lift your leg. Lift it up. - Yes, like that. - It looks stupid. - Do a roll then. - How do I roll wearing armor ? You forgot about my costume. OK, then duck. So two times in a row. One, two, three, jump ! Duck down. See ? Much better, right ? Who goes on after me ? Pigsy, no ? I'll show you. Careful with that. Beauty ! Come on. Beauty. Like this. - Be more perverted ! - Pigsy likes beauties. - Beauty ! - Yeah, that's right. Come and play with old Pigsy ! Butterfly Lovers, Starring Dan Dan I got myself a brand new robe. It's so bright and cool. I look so good. I read a book in less than three years. I'm also smart ! I am such a good son that I call my dad sir. So noble, so righteous ! Still... in the spring, it's too nice out to study. And summer... Please don't mess up my eyebrows again. How could I ? I'm fixing them. Your eyes are so red. What time did you go to bed ? Not that late. See, I knew they'd be crooked. Hey, niece... Do you have a boyfriend ? Don't be silly. Why would I want one ? What is it ? A louse, look. Ouch ! That hurts. Lice bite, you know. It's not like you've never had them. Remember when I picked out 88 lice from your hair ? That was a long time ago. Hurry up. You're on next. Aunty... I need to talk to you about something. What is it ? Let's talk after the show. That's the show ! Same time tomorrow. Thank you all for coming ! Walk slowly. Take care ! You're crying again, Grandpa Wang ? It's just a show. - Same time tomorrow ? - Yes. Take care ! We got a lot of tips today ! Who are they for ? Who do you think ? In my next life, I'll be a pretty young thing too. Dream on. Dan Dan. Here's your 10%. The rest is for your aunty. - Fold my robe. - Do it yourself. - Sign here, Lao Er. - Do it for me. Anything else ? We may as well stop. Shut it all down. I know the owner of a bunch of hot pot restaurants. - Lao Wu knows him too. - Mask changing ? Why are you still resisting ? Everyone gets rich changing masks. Look at us, we barely get by. What's the point ? What do the others say ? This place will be demolished sooner or later. Let me think about it. This guy is rich. He'd even give us benefits. - I got it. Go rest. - And they pay more... Next ! Anyone else ? Aunty ? Do you mind if we talk another night ? Can you tell me how to find the chief ? - Who are you with ? - I'm from the opera troupe. Is the chief back ? In there. Hello, Chief. He's not in today. How can I help you ? But this is a demolition notice. I know. And I went to their office this morning. But they told me to come here and ask for the chief. They are deflecting responsibility. The Cultural Bureau takes care of cultural issues. You need to speak to them. But can you at least show this to the chief ? The chief didn't write this, and neither did I ! Go back to City Planning and ask nicely. But I already did ! You have to go a few times. That's how it works. And be respectful. Then give me the chief's number. I'll ask him myself. I can't do that. If everyone's calling him, how's he supposed to work ? But our troupe is under your jurisdiction. We only deal with cultural matters. Xiao Liu ! Only culture. If you can't help me, then who can ? Miss, please leave. Zhao Li ! Don't you recognize me ? I push my dad in a wheelchair. The one who cries at every show. Remember now ? - Of course ! Xiao Wang. - That's me. I thought you looked familiar. What are you doing here ? I work here. And you ? - I came to see the chief. - The chief ? He's away till Friday. You know him ? Can you look at this ? I don't even know who to talk to. Please. Could you talk to him ? I don't even... Don't worry. Ten days. That's not a lot of time. Let me give you a piece of advice. Have a back-up plan just in case. Go look at some new theater locations. I'll contact you as soon as I hear something. So, how's Xiao Tang doing at mask changing ? Better than us, of course. - How much does he make ? - At least 200 a night. For 3 minutes of mask changing. Plus a hot pot meal. Performing while people eat... How is that opera ? It's more like circus tricks. Zhao Li ? Do you think our theater will be demolished too ? - I haven't heard anything. - They demolished a few houses. If they do, we'll have to move again. What ? Move again ? How do you perform without a theater ? If we move again, I'm done ! The real problem is that opera isn't cool anymore. If we really want a new audience, then we need to add something new to our show. Just because you get all the tips doesn't mean you know everything. It's midnight and Dan Dan's still not back. Go to bed, Zhong Zhong. No more playing. Hey ! She's not a kid anymore. She can stay out late. That's not what I'm worried about. What if she's thinking about leaving ? Did she say that ? Not really. But what if she does ? We'll worry about it then. Come to bed. "Worry about it then" ? Are you going to play her roles ? She's just one person. We managed when there were only four of us. You think the audience comes for you ? - They come to see her. - It's not like she's our daughter. Come to bed already. So what ? We still raised her. Hey ! Can you talk to her and see what's going on ? OK, I'll talk to her. Let's get some sleep. My feet are still wet ! Let go ! Go to sleep ! FOR RENT TO BE DEMOLISHED Hey ! Who are you ? Why are you following me ? Wait ! Stop ! Let's thank our three divas dancing tonight ! Is everyone having a good time ? Can I help you, ma'am ? Let's hear it ! Would you like a table ? Now let's welcome our next performer. She's only 20 years old ! Paying customers only. As beautiful as a butterfly... From right here in town. Dan Dan ! - Where are you going ? - What do you care ? What are you doing in a place like this ? A place like what ? You're not embarrassed ? Look at your dress ! What's wrong with my dress ? - I can't say anything ? - Say what ? You have no right ! Stop ! Where are you going ? Have you seen yourself ? You look like a prostitute ! How can you say that ? I'm singing, I'm working. I wear what I want ! You work there ? Don't I pay you to sing ? You're here to embarrass me ! How am I embarrassing you ? You only care about your stupid opera ! What about what I want to do ? What's best for me ? You want me to sing opera so I can make you money ? Here, take it all ! Leave me alone. You're not my mom ! Have you forgotten who raised you ? It's your fault, you dwarf ! Scram ! Zhao Li ? You want to leave ? Xiao Tang found me work. What kind of work ? Mask changing. You know my situation better than anyone. My mom needs so much medicine. I have so many debts. I'm so worried, sometimes I can't even sleep. And the kid... His school keeps asking for more money. When do you leave ? What's going on ? What is it ? When will you be back ? Come back soon. Come back once your father's better. We need you. Hey, what are you doing ? I want a hug too. Watch your hands ! You watch your hands. Come back soon. Don't forget us. See you soon, OK ? Mom, I'll pick you up in a few days. We'll be waiting ! See you soon ! Take care ! There goes another one. What will we do now ? What's for dinner ? This place is not bad, eh ? - How much ? - 80 in total. That much ? Wait, don't take her money ! Sorry, it's already paid. I said it was my treat. Take this. What did you want to talk about ? I wanted to apologize. For the other night. I did it because I think of you as my daughter. But I shouldn't have hit you. Niece... You said we should try new things in the show. I thought about it, and you're right. But you're the only young person left. Maybe when Li Ling comes back... She won't come back. Says who ? She said as soon as her father gets better... She won't be back. - When she's back... - I'm telling you, she won't be back ! I told her that I wanted to leave. That's why she left. Don't you get it ? She will never come back. You want to leave too ? Aunty... I don't want to leave. If you stay, everything will be OK. Today's show: Under the Lake It's pouring again. I guess there's no performance today. That's for sure. Lao Wu, are we performing or not ? If not, I'm playing Mahjong. What's the hurry ? It's still early. No show means no money. But at least we can drink. Look at him, he even put his uniform on. He's fast. The model citizen. The early bird gets the worm. I'm getting ready just in case. You are so right. This rain is nothing. Back in the day, in my mom's troupe, no matter how hard it rained, for every single show, the theater was packed. - That was ages ago. - No, I was 19. In those days, a single ticket cost as much as 5 kg of lard. The good old days. Back then, opera was so popular. What a pity, Zhao Li. It's just for fun. You still call yourself a man ? Our troupe was so poor. We didn't even have enough money for costumes. We cut up linen bags and tied them together. My liquor costs money ! It's not like there's a show today. I can eat seeds at least. We used anything and everything we could find. Even Grandma likes modern things. If this is what the audience wants, then opera is done for. Speak for yourself ! I'm definitely not done yet. These days, old people can do what they want. Look at that. Here come some audience members. Let's perform for one person. Come in. What are you doing here ? What did he say ? The problem is... many troupes are in the same situation as you. And they all ask the chief for help. So I was thinking... if I could convince him to come and see your show... The chief is coming ? Can you try and make the show even better ? Even more spectacular ? If he likes it, maybe he can help you. Know what I mean ? Move your butt ! Move it up and down. Twist ! Up and down ! Move your chest ! - Lao Wu, where are you going ? - Not far. Careful, it's slippery. Dan Dan ! Are you asleep ? What are you doing ? Playing games. What kind of games ? - I don't want any. - You're texting, aren't you ? - Delicious, right ? - It's too sour. Thank you for earlier. - For what ? - The way you cheered them up. One more. No, thanks. Really. Think about it. Only old people go to the opera. There is no new audience. We lose more people every year. Soon there won't be anyone left. Even if I stay now, what about next time ? - What will we do then ? - So I should just quit ? Look Dan Dan, just because you can make some money singing a few songs... Without opera, you wouldn't even be here today. Besides, those places... You think you'll be there long ? I'm telling you this for your own good. For my own good ? Is that why you made me learn opera ? If opera's so great, why didn't your son learn it too ? Lao Wu ! - Have you seen Lao Wu ? - Nope. - Have you seen Lao Wu ? - Nope. Dwarf ? Dwarf ? - Can you mask change ? - Of course. Then there's no problem. You can see how good business is here. If you mask change here, then you'll be worry free. A friend of yours ? Please go on. Lao Wu. Art must learn to adapt to the real world. If it doesn't, you see... You're just getting home now ? Were you out gambling again ? Making a fool of yourself. Have you lost it ? Go ahead ! Smash it ! Free Show Today Stop there ! They're too big. And they don't even match. What do you want ? Like hell I'll perform for free ! They keep all the money ! We actors barely get enough to eat. And now she wants us to beg for an audience in the street ! What's the problem, Lao Er ? What's going on ? Why should we perform for free today ? Who's going to pay ? We're all being cheated ! I explained this. The chief is coming today. So what if the chief is coming ? What can he do for us ? Will he prevent this place from being demolished ? That's right. You thought we wouldn't find out about this ? You've been lying to us all along ! You've been using us from the start ! And Li Ling didn't leave because of her father. She just found a better job. Have you ever told the truth ? What are you all yelling about ? This early and already fighting ! Can't you just do your jobs ? Aunty needs your help. I shouldn't need to remind you. And you say we're family, yet you're barking the loudest. After your surgery, who brought you food ? Stop playing the saint ! You're just her puppet ! She treats you like a cash cow and you still defend her ! Get off your high horse. You're the one who's always talking about leaving. And suddenly you've changed your tune. If you want to help her, just stay here forever ! That's right, you hypocrite. How dare you talk about us ? Then I'll stay. This is great news ! Dan Dan's staying. Wonderful ! Let's all get back to work ! To the car ! Here we go ! Free Modern Opera Show This way ! What are you doing here ? What do you want ? - You got the notice last week. - What notice ? - What are you doing ? - Get out or I'll go crazy ! - Go away ! - You bastards ! Get out ! Listen carefully. You can have this place over my dead body ! The tire blew. It's flat. Reserved Seat Are we starting soon ? They are going nuts. Is there a show or not ? They are going to riot soon. Start the show ! Hurry up and start the show ! If not, we're leaving ! Start or we'll leave ! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Frankly, I didn't expect so many people to show up today. Especially since most of you are here for the first time. First, I'd like to thank everyone for coming. But the show might start later than planned. Folks, please keep calm. There is a reason for this delay. Today we are expecting a very important guest. And why did we invite this person ? Because we know this area is being demolished. And unfortunately, that includes our theater. So we invited this person today to see if we can keep our theater. - Let's leave ! - And perhaps... It's time ! Get on with it ! Start the show ! But... we don't want to miss this last opportunity. And that's why we invited him. Start the show ! Hurry up or we are leaving ! Please, folks, let me finish explaining. All of us in the troupe depend upon this profession. I've been doing opera since I was 13. I haven't stopped since. We don't make much, but I never thought about quitting. Because we all love what we do. If we don't have a place to continue this... I'm afraid we might have to... disband. If we disband, then all that we have accomplished... We've been together for more than ten years, like a family. And we really need to do this work to survive. Without opera, I don't even know what we'd do. OK, we understand. We've worked really hard on this new show. - Put on a good show for us. - But... Here ! We are back ! The chief is here ! He's here ? Really ? Where ? I don't see him. Is he really coming ? - So many people. - Look at that audience ! It's free, so of course people will show up. Ready. Aunty. Dan Dan ? Dan Dan ? Here comes the boss ! She was right all along. We performed well today. - Today we all worked hard. - Yes, we did our best. So what did the chief say ? Zhao Li ? Zhao Li ? What did he say ? Hold this. So, Lao Wang... What will you do after this ? What ? You can try some other work. I'm going home to rest a bit first. Forget it, you're old. I've got a good job for you. Oh yeah ? All you need is a bed for some casual fun. Sounds more like a job for you. Give me a hand. Calm down, don't cry. All of this will soon pass. You still owe me a gun. I'm still here, aren't I ? Time to eat ! Hey, Grandma Gao ! It's hard to say goodbye. Have a drink. - Come on. - Coming ! - Time to eat ! - I'll be right there. Brother Su, come eat ! Coming. Lao Wu, come eat ! Lao Wu ! Where is Zhao Li ? Here, have one. Grandma Gao. Lao Wu, look. Uncle Li ! Why are you here ? There's no show today. We're disbanding. He can sit down. Let's eat. Where will you go next ? I won't perform anymore. I'll find another job. - Like what ? - All this work for a few pennies... With that attitude, you couldn't even wash dishes. What about you guys ? Where are you going ? We're going to Dayi. Dayi is not bad. Take me to Dayi, too ! At your age ? Go take care of your grandchildren. Screw them. I won't live as long if I stop performing. You think no one invited me ? I'm going to Pengzhou. Yes, she will get sick if she quits performing. She is an opera addict. Yes, it's true. She can't live without it. Liu Ming, where will you go ? Listen, our new boss is coming to pick us up. Come with us. Good idea. Go with them ! Can I come too ? Of course. You two are glued together. I knew you were a big softy all along. - Where is Zhao Li ? - Have a smoke, Su. Zhao Li, come here ! Even if you're not the boss anymore, you should still eat. Come on ! It's not like all this is your fault. Hurry up. Come on, the food's getting cold. Here. Let's have a drink. Come on. Look, audience members. We told them there were no more shows. Grandpa Wang is here too. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Yang ! Mr. Zeng. Uncle. What are you doing here ? If you leave, where will we go for shows ? Can't you take us with you ? When you guys are gone, we won't have anywhere to go. We old men don't have many pleasures left in life. It's so hard to see you go. Mr. Zhou. Mrs. Yang, Mr. Yang... No more fun without this place. So dazed I feel This feast in front of me But I've no appetite to taste it It's so hard to leave Those who filled our stage with flowers It's so hard to leave Those who offered Grains and gratitude There's nothing left to say Except until when Will we all meet again Everything has changed. - Are you sure it was here ? - I think so. It's all gone. Standing at the edge of the gentle boat This splendid view passing me by Feverish colors fill my eyes "Row slowly, please," I ask of you... Our gentle boat Let the river streams lead our way... See the fishermen by the shores Strolling by and humming their tunes See them there... Riding on their oxen and playing their flutes The sound of their songs is so delicate and calm For even the machines become a part of the song Then, I see... White cranes walking through the woods Wildflowers blooming in the fields Butterflies all around Ducks napping by the shore TO LIVE TO SING
