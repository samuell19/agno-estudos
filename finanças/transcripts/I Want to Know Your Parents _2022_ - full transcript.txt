Don't talk to him. He's a scumbag peddler. Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Kang Ho-chang, a lawyer. My counsel team just left. They're getting things ready for your trial. I specialize in inmate consultations. I see. These buttons keep giving me problems. Every time I stand up, my shirt gapes open. "Get buttons replaced." This uniform. It's lousy. Lousy, okay. Lousy. Replace fabric. - If you go to my office, - Yes, sir. The Times should've arrived. Make sure you bring me that. - Sure. - There's a Bible on my desk. Bi… A Bible? Okay. THE TIMES, BIBLE Is there anything else you need? Hello, this is Kang Ho-chang. Pardon? Hello, sir. I'm Han-gyeol's father. Nice to meet you. Do I look like a teacher to you? Excuse me? I must've missed the mark with today's outfit. I'm a parent too. Oh, I see. So why did they call us here? No clue. They called me here but haven't said why. Did the kids get into a fight? What's your son's name? Do Yoon-jae. Yoon-jae? Yoon-jae… It's only natural for boys to get into fights sometimes. That's how they grow and mature. Wouldn't you say? Some kids might be like that. But Yoon-jae isn't the type to hit anyone. He's gentle, you see. Hello. I'm the Grade 8 Class 3 homeroom teacher. Oh, hello. I'm Han-gyeol's father. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Would you like coffee or green tea? Coffee, please. Thank you. I should've come by sooner to say hello, but I've been so busy. Oh, that's not necessary. I didn't get a chance to come on Teacher's Day... - That's hot. - Are you okay? Oh, no. - It's fine. It didn't burn me. - I'll go get you a wet wipe. Geez, that was hot. She could've just taken it. You must be the teacher. Hello. I'm a parent of a student. Oh, I see. You must be the teacher. Hello. I apologize for not coming by sooner. I'm Park Kyu-beom's grandfather. He's a parent of one of the students too. Do Yoon-jae's father. My, you give off such a warm impression. You look like a teacher. Gosh, should I not have come today? Is this a meeting for fathers? No. I'm here because my wife went overseas to Haiti to volunteer. She's doing wonderful work. That's so admirable. Oh, well, mine is… Oh… Hello. You may stay seated. Looks like everyone's here. Mr. Jeong, you can go sit over there. - Are you the dean of students? - Yes, but I'm here as a parent today. I'm Jeong I-deun's dad. I'm Oh Jung-sub, the principal of Haneum International Middle School. We made an urgent request for you all to come despite your busy schedules because the police called the school early this morning. Haneum International Middle School. Our school's PE uniform? - Geon-woo. - Is he a student from your school? A fisherman fished him out of a lake. He must've gotten him out pretty quickly. Goodness, he's one lucky kid. When a person drowns, their whole body blows up like a balloon, and their face looks like it's going to explode. All the hair on their body falls out too. It's too hideous to look at. My gosh, how did the accident happen? It wasn't an accident. Geon-woo's homeroom teacher, Ms. Song Jeong-uk, received a letter from him. Read it, please. "I have been the victim of bullying for a long time now." I couldn't say a thing because I was scared they would retaliate. - "They don't see me as a human being." - They don't see me as a human being. I don't see myself as a human being anymore, either. I'm sorry, Mom. - "I'm thankful to be your son." - I'm thankful to be your son. I love you, Mom. "Grade 8, Class 3, Do Yoon-jae. Park Kyu-beom. Jeong I-deun. Kang Han-gyeol." That's it. Excuse me. Why is Yoon-jae's name in that letter? He's the first name here. Yes, so why is my son's name in that letter? Excuse me, Mr. Do. Please calm down and have a seat. Have a seat. We'll go ahead and start our meeting now, as outlined in our school's bullying policy. Geon-woo's parents are supposed to be present as well. Ms. Song. What does Geon-woo's father do? His student card only has information about his mother. I'm only a temporary homeroom teacher, so I'm not sure. Excuse me. I suppose you're not aware as you're only a temporary teacher. My son donates 30,000 won to UNICEF every single month because he feels sorry for all those dark-skinned kids. Principal Oh. Have you questioned the students? All four kids said the same thing, that nothing like that ever happened. See? There's no truth to it. It's not true. Oh, Goddess of Mercy… Where's Han-gyeol right now? The offending students are waiting in the debate room right now. What kind of nonsense is that? Excuse me? What will the other students think if our kids aren't in class? You're branding them as criminals before even having all the details. Students legally have a right to be in class. You should act according to the law. Why are you detaining innocent children? They're just staying in the debate room, not being detained. That's the same thing. When your elders are speaking, you don't need to give your two cents. Ms. Song. - Song! - Song! - Hey, snap some pictures. - Goal! Goal! Yes. Don't worry, Mr. Chairman. My apologies. Oh, yes. Of course. Of course, we can't allow the school to become a topic for gossip. Especially not for something like this. Mr. Do. Our school has a no-smoking policy. That's why I'm ventilating the room. Do Yoon-jae, Park Kyu-beom, Jeong I-deun, Kang Han-gyeol. GEON-WOO UNCONSCIOUS, SCHOOL VIOLENCE, SUICIDE NOTE They're not in alphabetical order. You're right. Maybe Han-gyeol's name is at the end because they're roommates. He shares a room with my son? I'll bet he's too scared to get any sleep. Has anything like this ever happened here before? No way, never. I didn't want to say this, but to be honest, Ms. Song is a temporary teacher. She may not have a strong sense of responsibility when it comes to the kids. How could they make someone like her a homeroom teacher? The school is largely responsible for this. So why are they spewing nonsense about the kid getting bullied? What was his name? The kid who died. Is he some kind of troublemaker? It's Kim Geon-woo. And he's not dead. They said he's just unconscious. And could you stop talking? You're making me uncomfortable. How did I do that? Just don't listen then. To be honest… I don't know if I should say this either, but Geon-woo is a beneficiary of a program for low-income students. Parents of kids like that often have unreasonable expectations. I believe that excessive pressure placed on him played a big role in his attempt to take his life. See? Kids with problems have problematic parents. Why don't we do this then? Until Geon-woo wakes up, let's keep the letter undisclosed and leave it in the care of the principal. Ms. Song is so young and lacks a sense of responsibility. That's what I'm saying. A suicide note can be used as evidence. Not disclosing it would be concealing evidence. - Suicide note? That's not a suicide note. - Then what would you call it? It's just a letter. A suicide note becomes valid upon the death of the writer and contains their last words. Didn't you say he isn't dead yet? If you do something wrong, you should be punished for it. If the contents of that letter come out, regardless of what the truth is, the names in that letter will become the names of criminals. It's a parent's duty to lead their child down the right path. You're not his parent, though. Instead of being blamed your whole life for ruining your grandson's future, tell Kyu-beom's dad to come here instead. I assure you, every father in the world thinks and feels the same way. It's different with grandfathers. Ms. Song. But Geon-woo gave this to me… I'll hold on to it for safekeeping. Read it. Read it. "A faculty member may not accept any object from a student. If they happen to come into possession of an object…". They must notify the principal and follow his or her orders. TO MS. SONG JEONG-UK They want to make a group chat. Could I have your phone number? I don't know how to do things like that. Mr. Park, you're quite the frugal man. I'm sure you've retired, but you still wear your police-issued shoes. Where did you work? I retired from the National Police Agency and went into teaching. You were one of the elite. Since we've been brought together like this, we just wanted to communicate with each other, that's all. After all, we're all in the same boat. I don't get on boats. I'm prone to getting seasick. Mr. Kang, take care. - Geez, why did you do that? - Do what? Yoon-jae, this isn't going to work. You need to go back to the States. Man, I'm not going back. I just got settled in. You punk. You call harassing kids getting settled in? Then again, the kids who take it are the idiots. Do Yoon-jae. You need to watch yourself for the time being. This is your last warning. Got it? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Will you look up from your phone when your dad's talking? So you and Geon-woo are roommates? Yeah. Did you hear about the accident? Yeah. Nothing happened, right? Yeah. Okay. Make sure you keep your mouth shut. I'm off. KANG Han-gyeol KIM Geon-woo Jesus Christ. What are you doing here? Why are you so surprised? I told you, didn't I? All dads think and feel the same way. Ms. Song. It's tough, isn't it? It's too bad the school doesn't know how dedicated you are. Want me to look into a position for you? Just a second. Hello, this is Song Jeong-uk. You got hold of Geon-woo's mom? Okay, I'll head over to the hospital right now. - Sorry, I need to go. - Sure. I'm sorry. Where are you, honey? The department store at a time like this? Go to the hospital. Yes, right now. Song! - Hey! - Song, what's up? See you later! So long! Keep going, there you go. Nice job. Nice. Later! EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER What… What's wrong, Geon-woo? Wake up. - Wake up. Geon-woo! - Ma'am, please. - Why are you trying to go first? - You'll really kill him at this rate. - Ma'am, please. Calm down. - Geon-woo! I'm Geon-woo's homeroom teacher. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ma'am. You punk. I hit him, and he couldn't even flinch. Sergeant Lee! Just a second. When will you start investigating? We don't investigate suicide attempts. It might not have been a suicide attempt. Ma'am. He has cuts all over his wrist. Looked like he tried hanging himself too. He's already made a few attempts to kill himself. Pay some more attention to your students. Honey. I-deun's teacher is talking to the police right now. The police? What did she say? I don't know. I can't hear a thing. For goodness' sake. SAEMGOL SPICY FRESHWATER FISH STEW I'm home. Why are you so late? Aren't you off today since you worked last night? Something came up at school. They pay their staff peanuts and milk them for all they're worth. Are temps not even human beings? Geon-woo. Han-gyeol? Why didn't Han-gyeol stop him? He definitely saw him. It was 5:15 a.m. 3 HOURS Three hours? What went on during those three hours, Geon-woo? Let's go. I found it, so you should be the one to open it. Damn it. What building doesn't have an elevator? - Hello, this is Kang Ho-chang. - This is Song Jeong-uk. Did something else happen? Sir… Did you take something from the room? I saw that you went to the dorm. Oh, Han-gyeol asked me to take home some stuff he doesn't use. Han-gyeol's desk is on the right, but you were on the left. I assumed the messy desk was my son's. Mr. Kang. Did you touch any of Geon-woo's belongings? Ms. Song. I'm a lawyer. Do you think I would steal from a kid? Sorry, but I'll have to call you back later. I'm in the middle of work. MOBILE SOLUTIONS Welcome. I'm here to get this phone unlocked. A service center can do this for you for free. - Really? - But, I'm sure there's a reason you came to see me. It'll cost 200,000 won to recover the data. All right, then. ID, please. We operate according to the law. We need proof of identity. So, how much in total? This is a no-parking zone. Plate number 5232, please move your car. - Please move your car. - Just give me a ticket and go. Do you have any cash on you? Go grab a bowl of jajangmyeon on the first floor. I'll get it to you when I'm done. I-DEUN'S FATHER: MS. SONG WAS TALKING TO THE POLICE How old are you? I was born in the Year of the Rooster. - The Year of the Rooster. - Yes. We're the same age, and we seem to click. My name's Do Ji-yeol. Kang Ho-chang. Delivery. 10,000 won. You guys are pretty talented. You even ride your bike down the stairs. Hurry. I'm busy. Here. Good work. Thanks. Let me see that. GROUP CHAT I-deun, Kyu-beom. I-deun, Kyu-beom. I don't see Yoon-jae. What about Han-gyeol? I don't see him either. What were they looking at? LET'S GO AGAIN TOMORROW! Man, the weight's coming right off. What are you doing, Geon-woo? Are you ignoring us? Hurry up and take a piss, jerk off! Did that jerk just dodge that? Did you? I asked you if you dodged it! - Answer me! - Hey, Han-gyeol. - Did you dodge it! - Make sure you're getting everything. Answer me. Answer me! Did you dodge that? Did you? Go on and take a piss. Hurry up! Hurry up and do it! Why would they film something like this? So, who was the instigator? That isn't important. It looks like Yoon-jae gave the orders, and Han-gyeol filmed the video. Are you blind? Watch it again from the beginning. Your two kids laid hands on him. My son was just singing. No way. Just singing, my foot. Ma'am, you should say something. Our kids didn't instigate it. Aren't their kids worse? They were all complicit. If he dies and they investigate, or if he wakes up and talks, it's all over. Let's get this show on the road. What if he wakes up? That's why you should hurry up and go. You're a lawyer. You're good with words. I'm scientifically minded. You use your mouth and I'll use my hands. Let's make this fair and make use of our talents. Jeez. Why are you overthinking it? We're just helping someone in need. If he wakes up in the next few days, he could be discharged right away, so… I'm in a bit of a pinch. I understand. All right. Are you Kim Geon-woo's mother? Yes. I'm here as a representative of Haneum International Middle School's PTA. Hello. Do you think the principal will give us the note? He has to. What do the other parents do? One's an obnoxious hospital chairman. One's a retired cop who's raising his grandson. And one's a lawyer. His wife ran out on him. Just do as I tell you. Are you threatening me right now? As the wife of a faculty member, I completely understand. But you spent the kids' lunch money on building this vacation home. Do you think other people will understand that? Our school has become the best in the country thanks to my sacrifices and services. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Jeong? Of course. I completely agree. But if you give us Geon-woo's letter, I'll make there's not even a cent out of place on the documents. I am a math teacher, after all. Maximum of three years, minimum of two years. A middle school student from Daegu… Maximum of three years and six months… Three years and six months… NEW MESSAGE WE GOT RID OF THE LETTER! - I-DEUN'S DAD NAM JI-HO NAM JI-HO MESSAGES I HEARD YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT I'M WORRIED BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAW THAT DAY, CALL ME Who are you? PIN NUMBER DON'T PRINT RECEIPT Your request is being processed. Please wait one moment. Hello. Which room is Kim Geon-woo in? He came in yesterday. He's been discharged. He woke up? No. His mother decided to move him to a bigger hospital. I see. Thank you. The phone is turned off. You will be transferred to voicemail. You will be charged after the tone. Son. What are you dreaming about? You haven't been getting any sleep because you've been studying. Things have been tough for you, haven't they? We're at a big hospital in Seoul. Your friends' parents helped us out so you could wake up. I'm so thankful. So Geon-woo, sleep just a bit more and wake up soon. I'll be waiting for you. Gosh, you little punk. My eyes are about to fall out from having to watch you. Geon-woo. Geon-woo. Just keep breathing. If you die, my son will be done for. Let's live quietly as if you were dead. There's someone we need to find. Mrs. Kim? Mrs. Kim. Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim! Stop right there! Hello, sir. Oh, you're having lunch. A kid by the name of Nam Ji-ho lives here, right? Are you here from the detention center? Someone from the center already came by this month. Seeing the kids often helps us bond with them. Wait. Which unit did she live in? Ji-ho. Who are you? KANG HO-CHANG Where's your ID? ID? He works for me. He's my office manager. Like a lackey? I hear you and Kim Geon-woo are best friends. No, we're not. Yeah, right. I know you are. Ji-ho. I'm a lawyer. I can only help Geon-woo if I know what happened to him. You two have met before, right? Did you see anything that day? I saw him once after not having seen him in forever. On the 15th floor of the apartment. I got a really bad feeling. Why? Geon-woo lives on the first floor. He said he just came up to get some fresh air. I was skeptical, but I let it go. So you… saved him. I saw him again not too long ago. On the first floor. Eat it. Eat it. Go on. Eat it. Did you see that? What was that? What is he doing? He really ate it like a dog! Hey, son. Did you eat the gimbap I made? Yeah… What's with your voice? I just woke up. I see. I finished my work early today. I'll be home soon. I should be there in an hour. - See you later. - Bye. Why the hell is she coming early? Hey. Why's she coming home early? Why's she coming early again? Why? Why? Die! Why the hell is she coming early again? I was going to watch the soccer game. Damn it. KOREA INFORMATION OLYMPIAD AWARD CEREMONY Geon-woo looks a lot like his dad. His dad bit the dust after he fell off a construction site. Hey. Your dad looks so lonely. You're a good son, Geon-woo. Time to do your duty as a son. You should die too. Want us to help you? Do you? Want me to help? Do you? Do you? Did you see their faces? All four of them? I never said there were four. There were three kids. One was tall with a dark complexion and looked like he played sports. One had curly hair and was heavyset. And one was fair-skinned and pretty like a girl. He's the one who cut him with a knife. Right here. Did Geon-woo die? What? I went to his apartment earlier because I was worried. All the lights were off, and I got a weird feeling. Hey, kid. You've got some impressive skills, popping in and out of other people's homes like that. The door was open. Listen to this cheeky little brat lying to us. I'm not lying! Come on. Who would believe a girl who's been in and out of juvie? I don't want any part of this. You guys do whatever you want. Ji-ho. You should collect your pay for your services. Nam Ji-ho saw nothing. That's the truth. Go. Han-gyeol may not be in the video, but his name's in the suicide note. I told you. It's a letter, not a suicide note. Mr. Oh, please give it back. I looked it up on the education office's site. Letters are fine because they don't come with an expectation of reciprocity. It also doesn't violate the anti-graft law. Mr. Oh, Geon-woo's letter… I went through a lot of trouble for this. FULL-TIME TEACHER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT Sign it and bring it back. Hello, Mr. Jeong. Gosh, ma'am. Congratulations.

Ji-yeol! Three, two, one, shock! Three, two, one, shock! - Did you try epinephrine? - We did, but we couldn't... - Sir... - Shut up. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe! Breathe. Breathe, damn it! Please! Now it's no longer a letter but a suicide note. Ji-yeol. I tried to save him. I really did. This may sound harsh, but it would've been hard for both Geon-woo and his mom. Rather than living in a vegetative state, his passing like this might be better. We just have to fulfill all our duties. And the last piece of evidence is gone. It's true that his death makes things easier for us. Take it away. Doctor, my Geon-woo isn't dead. He's still so warm. Yes, Geon-woo. Mom's here. I'm here. Geon-woo! Geon-woo, please! Geon-woo! Doctor, my Geon-woo isn't dead! Geon-woo, Mom's here! You said you could save him! You told me he would wake up! I'm sorry. It was me who killed him. Geon-woo told me he didn't want to go to that school. That it would be hard on me to have to pay all that money. He said he wouldn't go. I made him go. I killed him. I killed my son. No, Mrs. Kim. It wasn't your fault. Geon-woo… Geon-woo wanted to tell you he was sorry. That he was thankful to be your son. He asked me to tell you that he loved you. Where did you… Where did you hear that? He sent me a letter. Geon-woo sent you a letter? In it, he wrote the names of the students who bullied him. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Yoon-jae. What's the occasion? I was going to take the school bus. What's that? A birthday gift from Yoon-jae. A middle school student doesn't need toys. Get in. POLICE WARM AND RELIABLE HYEONIN POLICE - Mrs. Kim. - My son… He was bullied. The names of his bullies were written in a letter. Please… Please catch them. Look up how to properly pay respects to a man. Why? Just do as you're told. Just go. And don't forget to sign the guest book. Don't stay there to eat either. Just come out right away, okay? Honey. Why do I miss our son all of a sudden? Focus on taking care of your living grandson. FUNERAL HOME ENTRANCE Yoon-jae. Honey! Dad. Cry. This is the time for it. I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore I ask blessed… WHERE ARE YOU? I'M GETTING MY COUPON TO HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH. Our son is a good kid. He's just surrounded by bad kids who have done bad things. It'll be a little awkward if this ends up on his permanent record. SHOOT, I'M AT A PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC. I'M OFFICIALLY A NUTJOB. The kid's mom reported the case and threw a wrench in the works. But I'll wait for the right time and get it wrapped up. I'm counting on you. Don't worry about it, sir. I'M HAVING DINNER WITH A COP. SO ANNOYING. I'M HAVING DINNER WITH A COP. SO ANNOYING. Don't touch my laptop. Why did you do it? Do what? Why did you do that to him? It wasn't me. What was the reason? Where did things start to go wrong? Have I wronged you in some way? And how did Geon-woo wrong you? Why did you do it? Why! It wasn't me! It wasn't me, Dad. I didn't do anything to Geon-woo. It was all the other kids. I swear I didn't do anything. It wasn't me! I was just there because they told me to be. And I just watched Geon-woo because I was told to. Dad, I really didn't do anything. I swear I didn't. Please believe me. It wasn't me. Thank you for saying it wasn't you. Ms. Song, what is this insanity? They say pregnant women shouldn't go to funerals. But how can I not be here when it's for one of our kids? Kang Geon-woo was such a nice kid. His name is Kim Geon-woo. Oh, right. Kim Geon-woo. He's number one on our class list. Number two. Number one is Kang Han-gyeol. Oh, that's right. I got the two mixed up. Ever since they were in seventh grade, they were such good friends. They were joined at the hip. They were best friends? Ms. Song, I'm disappointed. A temporary teacher should still know things like that. I guess you wouldn't know this, either. At the beginning of the semester, they had a bit of a falling out. Han-gyeol. Kang Han-gyeol. Han-gyeol. Kang Han-gyeol! Han-gyeol… Geon-woo was a close friend of yours. Did something happen between you two? Why don't you come clean... What are you doing? Giving him a chance to apologize before Geon-woo's laid to rest. But he didn't do anything wrong. Mr. Kang, you have no idea what happened. Even if you do, you want to pretend like you don't. Even if you loiter outside someone's house, you can be charged for trespassing. If I ever see you again, I'll report you. Leave. You all are worse than the kids. You should be ashamed in front of your kids. FULL-TIME TEACHER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT NAME: SONG JEONG-UK Give me back the letter. Go work as an exchange teacher at our sister school overseas. I teach national history. You can apply for teacher training and study overseas. My specialty is Korean history. How about studying world history then? Ms. Song, have you no conscience? How can a teacher throw their students under the bus for their own benefit? For the police to properly investigate, they need that evidence... That letter never existed. Mr. Oh. Yes? What? We can't have a funeral bus coming to the school! Block it! Geon-woo was one of our students too. How can you do this to him until the very end? Are you trying to turn the deceased into a hero? Do you want to throw a parade for him? Hurry up and block it! - Stop! - Stop the bus! - Stop! - Get out of here! - Get out of here! - Open the door, sir. Sir, this is private property. Move the bus right now. - Get out. Move the bus. - What are they doing here? - Are you out of your mind? - Why would you come here? - For goodness' sake. - Move the bus. Let's go, Mrs. Kim. What are you doing? Stop them. - What are you doing? - Ms. Song, wait. Ms. Song. The school is strictly off-limits to outsiders. Parents of our students are not outsiders. Let's go, Mrs. Kim. - Ms. Song! - Wait. - Stop them! - We can't let you inside. - You can't do this! - Ms. Song. You can't do this. - Don't let them in! - You can't go inside. - Ms. Song! - You can't go inside. - We can't let you go inside. - Ms. Song! Lock the front doors! - Lock the doors! - Please stand back. - Hurry up and lock the doors! - Hey! Don't push! - Ms. Song! - You shouldn't be doing this. - No… - No! We've locked the doors. Let's go! You can do it! You've got this, I-deun! Hang in there! Hey, Kang! Why are you so late? - You must've had a trial today. - Yes. Look, it's Han-gyeol. Look at this. I got a great shot of Han-gyeol. Honey, look! Here they come! Hang in there, boys! Hang in there! Come on, Han-gyeol! Haneum International is pulling away. Twenty meters, ten meters, five meters. Goal! They've won the race. Our kids will be okay, right? They've wrapped up the investigation. - Yes! - Haneum International! HANEUM BULLYING AND SUICIDE INCIDENT BRING BACK THE LATE KIM GEON-WOO! This isn't right. How can you just wrap it up like this? Please relaunch a formal investigation. Get out of the car. Geez, the pair of you are driving me nuts today. Mrs. Kim. Ms. Song. What do you want us to do? We looked thoroughly but found nothing. There's no evidence that the four of them did anything. I'm the evidence. I told you, he sent me a letter. Hand it over then. See? You don't have it. She told you she had it before. She told you she saw the letter! The suicide note! Ma'am. Find the note and bring it. Until you do, you can forget the re-investigation. Let's go. - Let's go inside. - Let's go. Mrs. Kim. HANEUM BULLYING AND SUICIDE INCIDENT BRING BACK THE LATE KIM GEON-WOO! Big smiles, everyone. One, two, three! Okay, one more time. One, two! Nice. Let's take one last picture. One, two, three. All right. That came out nicely. - Everybody, clap! - All right. Smile bigger. Hello, Mr. Chairman. Hold on a second. What's up? What? Say what? I'm the Grade 8 Class 3 homeroom teacher at Haneum International Middle School. My name is Song Jeong-uk. In order to reveal the truth behind a case of bullying at this school and demand a proper investigation, I'm sitting in front of this camera. The school authorities at Haneum confiscated a letter written by Geon-woo and tried to conceal this incident. The perpetrators named by Geon-woo in the letter, Do Yoon-jae, Park Kyu-beom, Jeong I-deun, and Kang Han-gyeol. Not one of them has apologized. To everyone who watches this video, I'd like to make an earnest request. Damn it. What if we end up in the slammer? Come on, no way. We'll go if we have to. Just think of it as a mini vacation. We wouldn't be there for long anyway. What happened? The case was picked up by another precinct. They're going to re-investigate. From now on, we'll have to get our oars in sync. If even one of us slips up, we'll all drown. There's no way out of this. Let's have them turn themselves in. How can you make it sound so simple? All kids roughhouse a little when they're playing around. If that's a crime, every person who went to school in this country is a criminal. We'd have to turn ourselves in first. What if we just partially acknowledged it? It might lessen the consequences a bit, but a criminal is a criminal. We can't admit to it. If they turn themselves in, they won't be innocent. Reach a settlement with his mother first. We cannot settle. If they aren't acquitted, it'll go on their criminal record. What are you suggesting we do? Is there really no way? The police won't find the evidence. The letter, the cellphone. Everything's gone. We just have to get our stories straight. With the homeroom teacher having blown the whistle, who would even believe us? She spread false information and is blackmailing us. Song Jeong-uk is the liar, not us. She is blackmailing the school and the parents to get a full-time teaching position. That's how we'll drive her into a corner. - Here she comes! - There she is. Is it true you tried to negotiate a settlement on behalf of the victim? Were you aware the school filed a suit for the spread of false information? Were there any issues? Who knows? I'm sure Yoon-jae did well. I wasn't in the interrogation room. - This way, sir. - Which law firm are you from? Good day, sir. His dad's a lawyer? Apparently so. They say he's a well-known inmate consultation attorney. Don't say a single word. Okay. Hi. So you're Han-gyeol. You're a good-looking kid. Let's make this quick and easy. I'd like to finish this quickly too. Han-gyeol. You saw Geon-woo leave on the day he drowned, right? That early in the morning? How? A dashcam got a perfect shot of your face. It's possible since they were roommates. He's also a light sleeper. Why didn't you stop him from going? For all he knew, he could've been out to get some air. Can't your son speak for himself? Hey, kid. Let me hear your voice. So what did Kang Han-gyeol do after that? He fell back asleep until the morning bell went off. Is that so? Let's take a look. TESTIMONY In March, you called Geon-woo to the pool and subjected him to water torture. Han-gyeol, why'd you ask me to come here? That never happened. Kang Han-gyeol threatened and assaulted Geon-woo with a weapon... Wait, hold on. Who gave that statement? You stole Yoon-jae's drone too, didn't you? - That was a birthday gift. - A gift that costs four million won? Those are all lies made up by Do Yoon-jae. Do you have any evidence? Do Yoon-jae and Jeong I-deun's statements say the exact same thing. All the times, locations, and details match up. They colluded to come up with a story. Their lawyer schemed all this up. Han-gyeol. You threatened to kill Geon-woo before, didn't you? No, he didn't! You invited your friends on your birthday and nearly killed Geon-woo as they watched. His wrists. You cut his wrists like this with a knife. - Isn't that right? - Detective! Han-gyeol did what? On his birthday… His birthday… Did you say he assaulted and nearly killed Geon-woo? When Geon-woo is smiling like this? Ma'am. Senior Superintendent General Park wants to see you. Sir. How have you been? Just living it easy. Things must be tough right now because of your grandson. I'm too ashamed to face you. Don't worry about me, and act according to your convictions. Ma'am. - What is it? - The informant is here. Right. Well, take care, sir. Detective Choi. Bring her in. Is that the guy? Geon-woo's lawyer… Lieutenant Shin. Request an arrest warrant for Kang Han-gyeol. - Make sure to add destruction of evidence. - Dad! - No. It's not true! - Dad! - Dad! - It's not true! I can explain! - That's not what happened. - Dad! Dad! I HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF BULLYING… After we get rid of the note, our work is done, right? We had to have one more go down to end this game. I feel kind of bad for Han-gyeol's dad. What's wrong? Do you want to switch places with him? No. It sure feels reassuring with the senior superintendent general here. Sir, thank you. Don't overthink it. Just think of our kids who have their whole lives ahead of them. All right, let's have a drink. Cheers! Ji-ho! Nam Ji-ho! Nam Ji-ho! Where's Ji-ho? At home probably. Why? Don't you know her address? What's the reason? Why me? Why does it have to be my son? I'm not sure. I was curious about that too, so I asked my son. He just doesn't like him. I feel that way too. Let go! Let go of me! He's going to end up dying at this rate. I'm here to see inmate number 829, Kang Han-gyeol. Inmate 829 has rejected your visit. - Why? - I said Kang Ho-chang was here, and he refused to come out. Ma'am, please tell Han-gyeol that I'm sorry. - Okay. - Goodbye. Get back safely and don't get drenched! Don't run! The road's slippery! Goodness. - The dorm's going to close soon. - We're doomed. - Let's hurry. - Hey, be careful. - Hello. - Hi, welcome. Ma'am, could I ask you a few questions? Yes, that's him. He used to come here often and buy bread, milk, and even coffee. - He came often? - Yes. But it's a 30-minute walk from here to the school. Gosh, you know there's nothing in front of that school. But he always came in the middle of the night. His face always looked just awful. He had bruises everywhere, a busted lip, and his arms and legs were in bad shape too. Goodness. I felt so bad for the poor kid that I used to give him an extra banana milk. What was his name again? - It's Geon-woo. - No, not Geon-woo. What's the name of that one newspaper? The Hankyoreh. That's what his name sounded like. Not Geon-woo? Han-gyeol came here? Hankyoreh. He was the pitiful boy. - Han-gyeol? - Yes. Hello. - Han-gyeol came here? - Yes. He would always buy ointment and pain relief patches. Han-gyeol? Are we a joke? Tell us the truth. Hey. You bastard! He's trying to hold out. Hey. You think we're a joke, don't you? Damn it. You ratted us out, you bastard! It wasn't me! Geon-woo… Geon-woo went to Ms. Song and narked on you guys. Do you want to die? You want to live? Want to trade places? Hey, you'll catch a cold. Let's go. Let's give Han-gyeol a hand. Nice shot, Han-gyeol. Nice! SAEMGOL SPICY FRESHWATER FISH STEW Ms. Song! Ms. Song! Han-gyeol wasn't the instigator. He was a victim, just like Geon-woo. Geon-woo wrote Han-gyeol's name and held him accountable. He put Han-gyeol's name at the end. That means he had room in his heart to forgive him. If it's true that Geon-woo would've been willing to forgive him, you took away any chance he had to be forgiven. Ms. Song! Don't testify tomorrow! Han-gyeol is Geon-woo! Ms. Song! I'll fight hard until the end to bring the truth to light. How does it feel to accuse your students? Why did you reveal the names of the students? - Could you tell us how you feel? - He's here! How does it feel to be defending your own son? - Coming through. - Move to the side, please. Lift up your head. Let me see my son's face. Case number 7416, defendant Kang Han-gyeol. Case number 7416. Defendant, Kang Han-gyeol. PROSECUTION COUNSEL Please be seated. Prosecution, state your position. "The defendant, Kang Han-gyeol, called the victim, Kim Geon-woo, on March 3, 2017 to the Haneum International Middle School swimming pool, where he assaulted him, and for three months, until May 18, when the victim threw himself into a lake, he humiliated, coerced, threatened, and inflicted injury on the victim." Counselor. Does the defendant admit the charges? The defendant, Kang Han-gyeol, has never participated in any criminal acts that led to the death of Kim Geon-woo. He denies the charges. I call Song Jeong-uk to the witness stand. "I swear to tell the whole truth without hiding or embellishing any facts, and if there is any untruth, I vow to accept the penalty for perjury. Witness, Song Jeong-uk." WITNESS Witness, what did you write under occupation? Counselor. We're starting with the prosecution. The witness, Song Jeong-uk, is not a teacher. For the testimony to have veracity, every small detail must be truthful. Witness. Are you currently a teacher? I'm preparing for my appointment exam, as my contract has ended. I was a teacher during the time of the incident. Please revise the witness's occupation to unemployed. We'll be checking things thoroughly. - You may question the witness. - Witness. Did the victim, Kim Geon-woo, send you a suicide note? Yes, he did. He said he had been bullied for a long time, and because he was scared they might retaliate, he couldn't tell anyone about it. Do Yoon-jae. Park Kyu-beom. Jeong I-deun. Kang Han-gyeol. The names of the perpetrators were listed in the suicide note. Evidence cannot be accepted without an original copy. The principal and the parents of the perpetrators saw the note. They requested that we do not disclose the note, which contained the names of their children. Nothing of the sort ever existed. Song Jeong-uk testified that she gave you the suicide note. She told me Geon-woo had sent her a letter, so I asked her to bring it. But instead of bringing the letter, she only demanded to be hired as a full-time teacher. She said she would handle the matter discreetly. I refused her demand, as it went against regulations. Then, I guess it's possible that Song Jeong-uk could've had a grudge against you because of that incident? She came and threatened me and filed a malicious complaint with the education office. She also brought shame to a prestigious school by spreading false information. I have no further questions. Are you sure this path is the right one? If you trust and follow me, you'll survive. I quit. Because I was so heartbroken. "I swear to tell the whole truth without hiding or embellishing any facts, and if there is any untruth, I vow to accept the penalty for perjury. Witness, Do Yoon-jae." Dad. Why is Yoon-jae in a school uniform? He went back to school. My friend, Kim Geon-woo, was popular because he did well in school and had a good personality. It was Han-gyeol's birthday that day. Geon-woo said he'd throw him a party and asked us to come. I really didn't want to go, but I went because of Geon-woo. Han-gyeol doesn't have any friends, and he's really strange. Geon-woo was passed out on the floor of the pool. We tried to call an ambulance, but Han-gyeol refused to let us. - That's not true… - I don't know the reason why. That's not true… It's not true. I performed CPR on him. My dad taught me how to before. Geon-woo, who was on the verge of death, came back to life. You made me do it. - You made me do it! - Han-gyeol! You're the ones who bullied him! - No! I'll do the talking. - You're the ones who killed him! I'll do the talking. - Han-gyeol. - You made me do it! - Han-gyeol. - I didn't do it! Han-gyeol, let Dad do the talking. - Counselor, don't do this. Move! - But they keep lying! - I didn't do it, Dad! - Get out! Go on. Dad! Court is adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE What is your relationship with the victim, Kim Geon-woo? - We went to elementary school together. - Again. - Do it properly. - Geez. You can tell he was a former general. He has the eyes of a pro. - We lived in the same apartment... - Again. Ji-ho, you need to do a good job. - We went to elementary school together. - Again! The old lady knows how to handle people. She's the pro. - We went to elementary... - Do it with sincerity! I'm not doing it! Let go of me! You little punk! This is tough. That girl, I swear… Excuse me. Mrs. Park! - Mrs. Park! - Ji-ho! Oh, no! Ji-ho! Ji-ho. I have a favor to ask. Ji-ho! Open the door! Open it! Ji-ho! Honey! Ji-ho, I'm really sorry, but could you be honest tomorrow and tell everyone what you know? You know Han-gyeol wasn't there. If I tell the truth, what will you do for me? I'll give you everything. I can give you everything I own. Please. I beg you. But you just have one kid, Han-gyeol. That side has three. Do Yoon-jae. - Park Kyu-beom. Jeong I-deun. - Hey! Ji-ho! Their dads already gave me three times the money. - Hey. - Get out of there! Hurry up and get out of there! Nam Ji-ho! Get out of there right now! I'm sorry, but could you cut me some slack? Ji-ho! Get out of the car! - Come out! - Open the door! All right. Get out of the car! - Ji-ho! - My gosh. Stop the car! My God! Ji-ho! Are you okay? Come on. Gosh, what a psycho. All right, let's go, everyone. "I swear to tell the whole truth without hiding or embellishing any facts, and if there is any untruth, I vow to accept the penalty for perjury. Witness, Nam Ji-ho." Prosecution, you may question the witness. You witnessed Kim Geon-woo being assaulted. Is that correct? - Yes. - Where did it take place? At Kim Geon-woo's apartment. Could you be more specific? They tied a leash to Geon-woo's neck and dragged him around. They made him lick food off the floor and said he should die like his dad did. They said they would help him do it. What else? Also, they threatened him with a knife and cut his wrists with it. - You bastard! - Bailiff! Take her outside! - You bastard! - Come here! Calm down! I will kill you! You bastard! - Bailiff, take her outside. - I will kill you! Get off me! I'm going to kill that bastard! Get off me. Judge! Give him the death penalty! Please give him the death penalty. Geon-woo! - Geon-woo! My baby… - Calm down, ma'am. - Calm down. - Get off! Get off me! Let go! Let go of me, you jerks! - I'm going to kill him! - Lift her up! If you make a scene, you will be removed from the courtroom. Prosecution, please continue. He unlawfully entered the victim's residence and threatened to kill him with a weapon. He then attempted murder by inflicting bodily injury. As a parent myself, I find these actions deplorable. Witness, did you clearly see the perpetrator's face on that day? Yes. Was it the defendant, Kang Han-gyeol? Yes, it was. The defendant's father, who is sitting at the counsel table, came to see you once. Isn't that right? He said that he was Geon-woo's lawyer. It's true. I went to see her. When I visited you, did I ever try to coax or threaten you not to testify? No. You made the decision to not testify, so why the sudden change of heart? Because I thought I should tell the truth. I have a question for the truthful witness. How many perpetrators were there? The counselor is asking a repeat question on a fact that was already testified to. Witness, answer the question. Kang Han-gyeol was the only perpetrator. You're saying the defendant, Kang Han-gyeol, threatened and attempted to kill the victim, by himself? Are you sure? I'm sure. If I tell the truth, what will you do for me? You just have one kid, Han-gyeol. That side has three. Their dads already gave me three times the money. Do Yoon-jae. Park Kyu-beom. Jeong I-deun. The defendant, Kang Han-gyeol, wasn't there. There's a small store next to a lake that's 4 km away from the school. According to a statement by the store's owner, every night, Kang Han-gyeol ran errands for Do Yoon-jae, Park Kyu-beom, and Jeong I-deun. His face and body were covered with the evidence of an assault. He also bought medicine to tend to his own wounds. Though he'd have to walk for an hour to get there and back with an injured body and on little sleep, he couldn't tell a soul, out of fear that the other kids might retaliate. To Kang Han-gyeol, for whom violence had become a part of his daily life, every day was a nightmare. As a victim of school bullying himself, I'm sure Kim Geon-woo… felt the same way. Honorable Judge. I am… an inmate consultation attorney with very little experience in defending someone… in a court trial, such as this one. However, this trial is one in which I must defend my client as if my life depended on it. It is the trial of Kang Han-gyeol, my very own son. My son, who was a victim of heinous acts of school bullying, was put into confinement due to the false testimonies of the perpetrators. For my failure to protect my son, I feel an endless sense of incompetence. However, right here, right now, I believe this is my last chance… to protect my son. Honorable Judge. I sincerely hope… you will make a wise judgment… based on truth. That can't be used as evidence. Neither can false testimonies. You scumbag. Your son's the one who killed him! He did it all by himself! That's the truth, you bastard! Any truths created by you are all lies now. Don't you feel guilty about what happened to Geon-woo? Are you certain the defendant is innocent? How did you feel when you learned that the defendant was a victim? How does it feel to clear your son's name? Do you have any words for the victim's family? Will you be taking legal action against the other students? In connection with the case involving the suicide of Haneum International student Kim Geon-woo, the Gyeonggi District Court has issued arrest warrants for three students. For three months, from March to May, students D, P, and J assaulted the victim dozens of times around the vicinity of the school, which led to the suicide of… Son. How have you been? Goodness, welcome! Thank you so much. There's nothing more I could want now. You shouldn't have. They're gift certificates. Honey, I signed a paper and got these certificates. I pulled the kid out of the water, yet you're the one getting a present? Did you pull out the student who fell into the lake? He forgets things all the time. He's going to a care home in two days. I didn't do it with my net. I went out to him in my boat. Goodness, there was this peculiar-looking bird… No, wait, what was it? It was whizzing and flying all around the cliff. But then… It started to attack the person sitting on the cliff. Then he fell into the water. But then… Behind him, there was this other guy. The guy and the plane just flew off somewhere after that. Did you see who it was? It was too foggy to see anything. Gosh, but that plane… That tiny little thing was… Gosh. Are you nuts? Why are you doing this? Why would you kill yourself? Why! You can't even take that much? Are you a wimp? You're a bigger wimp. This is all your fault. It's because you ratted them out to the homeroom teacher. It's all your fault! You're… worse than they are. What? What did you say? Just die. Just die! Die! Die! Die already! MY SON MY SON I WANT TO KNOW YOUR PARENTS
