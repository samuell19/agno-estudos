Oh, that Snot-Towel. Hey, there. Uh... How you doing? Not good. Just got divorced. That's bad. Did you have an affair? That'd be better. lt was over a religious cult. A cult? My ex got involved with some weird cult. She vanished with the kids. That's what happened to some neighbors of mine. The leader of the cult calls himself Friend. l know that cult. My colleague left our company to join it. There's even a Friend's victims support group. My cousin joined that cult too. l wanted to talk about this with either you or Otcho. Otcho...? Oh, Otcho. Friend tells a prophecy and it's the same as the story you once wrote. So l figured either you or Otcho might be the Friend. What story? Remember you wrote it at the base? The Book of Prophecies. The Book of Prophecies? The Book of Prophecies... l remember that story. The evil villain takes over the world! This Friend tells the same story and calls it a prophecy. lt's a coincidence. Just a kid's fantasy. Look at the symbol they use. No way! l saw that symbol at my neighbor's house! Didn't you come up with this, Kenji? What, me? Not so many of us know about the symbol. You, Mon-chan, and Yoshitsune. Otcho, Donkey. Yukiji, Maruo. Keroyon, Fukube. And the twins. You mean, Yanbo and Mabo? Are they here? No. They started up a company and got rich. There's another boy who knew about the Book though... l can't remember who. l'm convinced that Friend must be one of our classmates. Call me if you remember anything. Later. Oh, my back... Come on, old man. Call him? Who are they anyway? We avoided them because neither of us remembers them. One of them was Fukube. Oh, there was such a boy... Mon-chan! Weren't you in Germany? Got back 2 days ago and found the invitation. Kenji. Good day! Mon-chan... Good going! Cheers! l smuggled in some sausages. Pick one. Baby Kanna was right again! 5 times in a row!

The symbol? ''l want to talk with you soon whenever you have time.'' ''l'll contact you again.'' Funeral Service for Saburou Kido l knew something was up when he didn't show up. He died on the day of the reunion. Why did he kill himself...? Remember the jump he made before? What jump? l guess you weren't there. Konchi was there. What do you mean, he jumped? Remember Katsumata? The one who died when we were kids? He loved experiments but he died the night before we dissected carp. His ghost appeared every night in the lab. The teacher told me to clean the aquarium. That night l remembered that l hadn't turned on the pump. But l was too scared to sneak into the school at night. So l asked Donkey to turn the pump on for me. Donkey, please! Turn it on for me. And Donkey saw something... The ghost! What did he see? l asked him but he didn't tell me. He survived that jump so he figured... he would survive this one too. Guys... lt's from Donkey! lt's postmarked a week ago. He posted this and died... This symbol. Maybe he had something to do with the cult we talked about. We talked about The Book of Prophecies. Do you still have it? l don't remember anything. l must have thrown it away. We buried it. That's right. We buried it in the vacant lot where our base was. The lot...? This is trespassing, you know... lt was around here. Hey, it's the statue! We buried it near there. lt won't be there now! That was 30 years ago. l found something! Did we bury this? l don't know... What's this? Heibon Punch. And this is... Some erotica. Did you bury this ramen? l guess. This is a horrible drawing. ''Layzar Gun...'' Laser, l guess. What an idiot... You misspelled it. Look [ Skipped item nr. 406 ] ls The Book of Prophecies there? lt's a sketchbook. No. There's something large... The next time we dig this up will be when we protect the Earth from the Evil Organization! We should put that in too! No... lt wasn't me who came up with the symbol. Who was it then? Me...? Or me? Didn't somebody say that there was another boy who knew about the Book? l think l saw a boy sneaking around the secret base. Who was it? Do you remember Sadakiyo? Sadakiyo...? What did he look like? He was a strange boy. Didn't he move to another school in grade 5? l thought he died after he moved. He died? Go, Moonlight Ninja Squad! Kenji. Play with me. Kenji. Play with me. Donkey... l mean, did your husband have any problems? He was worried about a student he'd taught. A student? His name's Tamura. Now he studies at Ochanomizu Tech. Tamura had trouble with friends who were bad... Bad Friends...? Tamura... Care for some tea? Thank you. Did Donkey still like to look at the Moon then? All radars are clear. All green. This is Houston, come in. Everything's all go. Donkey sat in front of the TV all night and he's still there. l asked if he wanted to play but he didn't even hear me. He's at your place? Yeah, because he has no TV. Hey, Donkey. They did it! lt's incredible! That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind! We'll put our flag on the Moon someday!

Tomorrow? l have to look after Kanna and the shop... You used to tell me that you'd change the world with your music. l'll be there. Sorry about the short notice. lt's okay. What's that? This is for my... Grandson? lt's his birthday. You should go home early then. Well you know, l'm going to retire in one week. l have a case l want you to take over, Yama-san. The one about the Shikishima disappearance. The case you're working on now... about the mysterious death of Shikishima's student. l have a hunch that these cases are related. No, it's the epidemic. He must have got infected on his African trip. l don't think so. This is one hell of a mystery. What do you mean? Like biological weapons... No...! Look at this. l found this on the wall of the Shikishima house. Professor's daughter joined a mysterious cult religion. All we know is that their leader is called Friend. Friend? Case files And l found out. What? Who Friend is. Suppose he's around the age of 40... There he was, Friend... as a schoolboy. Yama-san. l'm a fool who's sacrificed his entire life to the force. And this old fool's hunches are often right. l think something horrible is about to happen... Maybe it's already well under way. l gotcha. l'll take this case from here.

They're evil, so they want to conquer the world. They'll conquer the world! You know... l think a robot is kind of lame. What are the villains' weapons then? How about a virus? A virus... You mean, germs? This song's weird... lt's Bob Dylan's ''Like a Rolling Stone''. lt's cool. You know... l had a dream as a child that l've never forgotten. And now, the universe is about to help me realize that dream. What is your dream? Share it with us! l want the world. That same dream again... - That's Kamisama. - He's up. Kamisama, another prophesying dream? What was it? Listen. Like l said before, a bowling lane is exactly 1.06 meters wide. We all roll the ball aiming for a strike. That's what we all want. The moment you let go, you think ''right down the middle''. Say you release the ball a few degrees off-center by the time it travels 18.28 meters to the head pin it would be way off! Just a little off, and you get a strike or a gutterball. That's all. He's so smart. A wise man. Hey-chan, got a minute? A man's in my hut! l know he's around... Kenji. That slacker's finally gotten involved in this. My dreams are coming true. Doomsday will come. Welcome, thanks for shopping at Kingmart.

You look like a moron... ls this the great prophet? l risked my life when l escaped to find you. Friend is serious about bringing an end to humanity. Which city's after San Francisco? Where do you deploy the virus next? Next? lt's the doomsday scenario you wrote when you were a child... How do the Evil Guys take over the world? They'll exterminate humans. They attack with virus weapons. They first attack... San Francisco! San Francisco? Like, Cafe San Francisco near the cinema. That's so random. Where then, after San Francisco? After San Francisco... lt's London! London. London's next. This can't be... Was this your idea too, the Laser Gun? Laser Gun! lt's a prototype. Don't mess with it. Who is Friend? ls it Otcho? l always believed that Friend was a savior. But... Kido said he wasn't... before we pushed him. Kido... You pushed him? Wake up, guys! No, you wake up! Rejection. Friend is not a savior! Rejection. How dare you...! You killed Donkey! He wrote this letter to you. Only you can do it... Save the world. Don't go to the police. They're under Friend's influence. Do you expect me to believe you? Another thing... The baby you're looking after. Your sister's baby... Protect... the baby. Kanna? Before Friend gets to her... What will he do to Kanna? ''l hope this letter reaches you.'' ''l'm in danger.'' ''Who is Friend?'' ''We swore to protect Earth.'' ''Only you can do it.'' ''Save the world.'' How am l supposed to do that? He sure looks like a no-good loser but... he's the one who fights the bad guys... When you finish eating, dump him. Where are the boxed lunches? Virus Spreads to London London's next... - l'm going to Kiriko's room. - Wait! What's wrong with him? Virology What's going on? What's Kanna and my sister got to do with... Friend...?

Are you sure you don't know who Kanna's father is? l have no idea. ls it Moroboshi...? That would have been nice but, no. Why not? Oh, didn't you know? On the day he came to visit Kiriko he jumped in front of a train. Sorry l didn't tell you sooner, Kiriko. What was my foolish son thinking...? He didn't leave a note... l don't know what to think. Your son wasn't the kind of man who'd kill himself. On the day he died, he visited me in the morning to give me a ticket to Kuala Lumpur. No... lt's my fault... l shouldn't have turned him down. Come again. Moroboshi... l'm being transferred overseas. l'm leaving for Kuala Lumpur in 2 days. So far away... The plane leaves at 12:30. l have two tickets, one is for you. l can't... l have the shop to take care of. l'll wait. Even if you don't board the 12:30... This is my address in Kuala Lumpur. l'm sorry. Why, Kiriko? Are there some other reasons? lf l can help... Sorry... l'm really... l just want you to... Moroboshi... l'll wait until the day you come. Did he, really...? You have to believe in your son. He wouldn't just kill himself and leave you behind. Oh, Kiriko. Our business was in trouble but you were slacking off, playing rock or something. Kiriko quit her career as a college researcher to help us with the shop. She's such a selfless one... except for that one time. Please look after Kanna for me! Tell us who her father is! You can't pack up and leave a baby! What are you thinking? Please protect her at all costs, Mom! Kiriko! Kiriko, wait! l have to... ''l have to...'' What did you have to do? Today, in central Osaka, near Tsutenkaku Tower a building security guard was found dead covered in blood that had drained out of him... Guards Died of the Virus in Osaka l must have thought about the Osaka attack too... l must have... Bio-warfare? That's too farfetched. lt's too big for a cult to pull off. They couldn't conquer Japan, even if they tried. But... But they'll stop at nothing. They already killed Donkey. But l'm just a photocopy machine salesman and he runs a stationery shop. A fancy shop! Don't you have responsibilities too? The baby, your mother, and the shop... l'm starting to remember more about The Book of Prophecies. The Evil Organization attacks Osaka and an airport. An airport? Tokyo Tower! Or a bullet train. There's a better place to blow up. Taking off, taking off! The airport! They blow up the airport, 3 days after the Osaka attack! 3 days after Osaka... That's today! No... Yukiji works at Narita airport. What's going on? You busted an innocent man for drug possession. And all he had was a bag of flour. That's him. l'm sorry about what happened. lt was a terrible mistake. Stop the car! Driver, wait here! Yukiji! Kenji! Why are you here? Calm down, this place is going to blow up! - Run for it! - Wait... lf what you're saying is true, l'd better run too. But you'd better think hard. Who are you?

They're on their way now to take Kanna. There are so many customers... Finally Kingmart is popular. What a cute baby... Mind if l hold her? Maybe it isn't appropriate... Let me hold her. May l?

You can't shoot Kanna's father, can you? What are you doing? Let go! Don't hurt him. His part isn't over yet. My part? What kind of a joke is this? What do you want? Hey! Let go! Operations are postponed indefinitely at Haneda after the attack 2 days ago. The terrorism threat has put the country in a state of emergency.

Damn it... The Book of Prophecies l found it. l buried it here... Kenji, sorry about your shop. Where is my guitar? The one l gave you before. Where is it? Give me my guitar back! Only you can do it. Save the world. The Book of Prophecies At the end of this century, the Evil Organization commenced its plan to take over the world. They first targeted San Francisco and London with their deadly virus weapons. As the next target for the virus attack they chose Osaka, the city that hosted the famous Expo '70. The whole nation froze in terror. Their next target was Haneda Airport. The horrified citizens of Tokyo had nowhere to escape. But that was only the beginning. There was a smoke signal of further destruction... December 31, 2000 finally arrived. With horrifying, earth-shattering footsteps, the shadow of terror had arrived in Tokyo. lt was an atomic powered robot! lt stomped over Tokyo, spitting out a deadly virus. Will we survive to see the 21st Century? Tokyo and the whole world faced doom! 9 heroes emerged to stop the evil. Would they have a chance against the villains? Sorry... l'm really sorry. Only you can do it. Save the world. Who did this, Yoshitsune? Was it Yanbo and Mabo? Stop! lf you don't destroy it, you'll get a figure-four leg lock. Or a jumping knee kick! Keroyon sneaked off. Let me help you. The Terrible Twins! l'll kill those fatsos! What are you doing here all by yourself, Kenji? You might think you're being brave, but you're just stupid. A man's got to do...

He was framed and had to go underground. ls this about the most wanted terrorist in history? l learned about him in history class. The truth can't be found in history books nor newspapers. This is the truth. Kenji Endo, the terrorist bomber could be hiding anywhere. Don't be nervous. Take off your clothes and lie down. You're Professor Shikishima's daughter? l know you...! WANTED lt wasn't you that Friend was after... He used you to get to your father. Because he's an expert in robotic engineering. They just used you. Maybe you're right. Friend said, ''Doomsday will come in December 2000.'' ''lt will rise from the ground...'' What's that? lts howl thunders across the city. Uuuugh! What's this thing? You'd better get your friends now. The game is going to start soon. Kenji, come play with us! Get my friends... Another dumb Japanese guy needs rescuing... The mafia's got him in their warehouse by the river. They're bad, l'll pay you handsomely for this. Take care of it. Where are you going? What's going on? Hey, you! Who are you? Stop or l'll shoot!

He's responsible for the Jonan Medical University bombing. He is also wanted for raiding the FDP headquarters. Kenji Endo, a terrorist leader. Kenji, a criminal! ''We're waiting for your tips 24/7.'' Say, YES, everyone. YES to you, YES to me. YES, FDP. How does present day Japan look to you? Kenji? Hey, it's been a long time, Otcho. How did you find me? Your wife... l mean, your ex-wife said she gets flowers from Bangkok on the anniversary... of your son's death. You've been through a lot. Wanna work at Papaya Heaven? This isn't exactly the future we dreamed of. No, but... there might be one thing that turns out like we imagined. ln December 2000, mankind will perish. Mom, l found him. Choji Ochiai? Mrs. Endo, how are you? You've all grown up! lt's been so long. Uncle Kenji. Uncle Kenji, you're home. Who are you? l'm Otcho. Who's he? My best friend. Stop! Otcho! Friend is serious. l don't know about this. A gigantic robot...? Can they really build this? And this passage. Are we the 9 heroes? 9 heroes... Kenji. Yoshitsune and Maruo! Hello, Choji. Ouch! Don't exaggerate! Hey, Otcho. Mon-chan. Fukube! Guten Tag. You all came for this! Keroyon didn't make it. You know, his restaurant's going really well... There are only 6 of us... Make that 7. Yukiji. Did you leave me out because l'm a girl? No... Otcho. How did you know about this place? You left the directions to the rendezvous point at home. That was awfully careless, Maruo. Sorry. l was a member of the secret base too. And l was the toughest. l threw Otcho too, right? l don't remember... Me neither. Right? Aw! Yes, that's right. That was then. lt's okay, Kenji. She's one of us. Two more to go. Who else knows about the Book of Prophecies? l've been thinking... about contacting two others. Not them... Mr. Minamoto? Takeshi Minamoto Mr. Minamoto...? My friends used to call me Yoshitsune when we were kids. Yoshitsune! l didn't recognize you. You've changed. You two have changed quite a bit too... Maybe because we lost a little weight? Just a little. - Does it hurt? - l give up. l give up! Tell Kenji that he's an old friend of ours. That he's not alone. We'd better report this. Yes, just in case. Call Mr. Manjome. Two garlic ramen. Al dente, extra onions, a few pickles, and an extra piece of BBQ pork! The usual, right, little missy? Here're your orders. Oooh, this is good. Remember Woodstock? lt was just a rock concert but 400,000 people came and were unstoppable. lf you put all you've got into it, a song can change the world. Nobody gave us any money again. That's just how it goes. Kanna... l have something to tell you. What is it? Please try to understand, Kanna. lt's dangerous to be in Tokyo. Mom, look after her for me. Kanna's all l have left. except for my crazy son. lt's time to go. Uncle Kenji. See you soon. l didn't send you the message... because l wanted you to be Kanna's guardian. Now l'm your guardian. l have to protect you for Kanna. Tokalevs, Berettas, Smith & Wessons... All bought in Shinjuku at premier prices. My goodness! They're real! ls it really necessary? This isn't child's play. Reality demands that we're armed. Right. l don't want to even look at these but... Dymanite! No! Friend has a plan for the last day of the 20th Century. We'll stop him before that. l don't know if l'll be able to pull the trigger... They're not exactly BB guns... l'm afraid you have to learn. We'll use arms to abduct Friend or Manjome, that's our only chance. Listen. Leave now if you want to. You look like you want to leave. Break it up! lt's a police raid! Somebody must have informed on us. Run for it! Quick! Live from Kenji's hideout. The police are still looking for clues. Their involvement in the Medical University bombing and... lt's possible that they are disguised to elude detection... That's cool. Good going. Finish your dinner. Hand in hand, FDP for you. YES, FDP. They're great. As the FDP led in July's nationwide election, it's now the majority party of the Lower House. Way to go, FDP. They're cool. Finish your food! Mr. Manjome hasn't gone public, but judging from the positive response to his party overseas... Now the news, Kenji's terrorist group is being investigated. The police have announced their findings in November's raid. Arms confiscated include, crates of TNT explosives, 22 automatic rifles, 30 automatic handguns, 50 hand grenades, 5000 bullets, and... Bullshit! Oh, you're back. They want to make us out to be horrible criminals. Neither Friend nor Manjome showed up at the Party congregation. lt's so cold. Here, pork dumplings. lt's hot. Aw, it's hot. Still studying those sketches? l just can't remember what this is... Hello? No sign of Friend going in or out of the Headquarters. Otcho, want a ride? ''A smoke signal of destruction...'' Oh, no. l remember now! ''lt was the beginning.'' ''The countdown to the end of the world.'' The terrorist attack on the Diet Building resulted in 32 deaths with 91 injured. Only FDP members escaped injury as they were out of the building. We've come to this page now. lt's today. ''9 heroes emerged to stop the evil.'' ''Would they have a chance against the villains?'' How will we fight them? l don't know. But there's nobody else to do it. That was nice. Yeah, the song's kind of weird but l liked it. Thank you. Are you finished? lt's time you two went home too. Yeah, but l have this feeling of dread. Why? l wonder how long we can go on like this. lt's almost the 21st Century... But it's reassuring seeing you do this at your age. The time will come that you'll have things to do. Happy New Year. Happy... New Year. Uncle Kenji. Kanna! Why are you here? l came here by myself by train. By yourself? Everybody is here now. Kenji. lt's time to play. Let's pick up some girls in kimonos! There's no one. Oh, but kimonos are really difficult to put on... You haven't even taken one off yet! Right, l should be positive. Onto the new century! ls that rain? What the...? We are interrupting the regular program for a newsflash. At 8 pm. An unidentified large object appeared in the Jimbo-cho area and it's on the move now. Newest reports coming in on the devastation on the Tube. An unknown virus is causing the deaths. Panic struck Paris at noon as many citizens fell bleeding on the pavements. Many fell unconscious in the Square, but there hasn't been an official report. l'm Jessie Mayfield reporting from Times Square. The Square has turned into Hell on Earth. l can't even begin to count the number of bodies strewn around me. Now l'm being covered by some sort of mist... Steve? That's awesome! Oh, my God! We have to evacuate. lt's coming! No heroics, okay? lf you know you're screwed, run for your life. l beg you... Don't waste your lives. Kenji. You too. l don't plan to die today. Somebody told me this once. Rock singers die at the age of 27. Like Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix... l figured l'd die at 27 too. But l turned 28 and l was still alive. l felt disappointed. l thought, ''Hey, l'm not a rocker.'' But there are many great guys playing rock in their old age. l used to think that dying young is great. l don't anymore. Do you know who told you that? l did. Back then, 27 seemed so far off... Kanna. l have to go now. A man's got to do what a man's got to do. But l'm coming back. So don't cry. l'll sing your songs while l'm waiting. l know all your songs, Uncle Kenji. ln my dreams, you don't die. Take care of Kanna. Let's go, guys. We have a job to do. One thing before we go... What does this symbol mean, Otcho? lt's the page-turning symbol from ''Sunday''. The pointing finger. And, remember what you used to call me then? You called me Bug-eyed Otcho. ls that all? That's what it was! Alright. Just like we dreamed back then... We've got to save the world. ldentify yourself! Stop your destruction. Ready to open fire! The robot just passed the Self Defense Force Camp. lt's headed for Shinjuku. Find out who's controlling it. We'll check here. Check the roof! We're looking now. Yukiji's trying to get into the FDP Headquarters. Damn, it's locked. Open it! Come out and open it! There's nobody here. Open it! Otcho, l found him! Give me that thing. Fukube, watch out! Who are you? Stop the robot. Take off that mask! Fukube! Fukube fell off the building with a man who had a controller. But the robot is... still moving. Fukube... Damn it! Okay, let's rock. What's this thing? lt's a big balloon, that's all! Just wait, l'm going to stop you! Be careful! Good, son of a gun! Kenji's climbed up the robot. Kenji. You! Stop this thing! Kenji Damn! l'm going to blow you up. 3 minutes to detonation. This will finish it off. lt's not moving... Play with me. Kenji. Play with me. Kenji. Come out! You sneaky bastard. l'm not hiding. l'm in front of you. What is that? l'm here. l'm right here. You'd better run, or your time bomb will go off. Take off your mask. You can't see what's going on with that thing on! You're hiding behind that mask! Take it off and face the horrible things you've committed! That symbol is ours! You don't deserve to use it. You're always lots of fun, Kenji. You are... Kenji, come in. Who is he? lt's almost 3 minutes. What's he doing? Let me go! Stay here! Kenji. Kenji. Kenji. lt's midnight. Kenji. Kenji. lt's the 21st Century. Uncle Kenji. Kenji. He never gave up hope. l won't either. l won't give up. Because... We still have hope. [ Skipped item nr. 1432 ] Our hope... lt's Kanna! You're violating the law by removing that poster. Stop! As evening shadows fall, there's the smell of curry in the alley. How much more do l have to walk before l get back home? Thinking about the croquettes l used to love at the local deli. Will they still taste the same? When l finally make it home. lt's nightfall now. All over the globe. l'm in a hurry headed back home. Some say the Devil laughs if you talk about the future. Let him laugh as much as he wants because l don't really care. l'll talk about the future about 5 or 10 years from now. l'll still be with you even 50 years from now. lt's nightfall now. All over the globe. l'm in a hurry headed back home. Through the pouring rain. Even in a thunderstorm. Even if it started to rain in spears. Let's go home. Nobody will stop us. Nobody has the right to stop us at all. lt's nightfall now. All over the globe. l'm in a hurry headed back home. lt's nightfall now. All across the world. Everyone in the world hurries back home. l wish those little things that you do every day. Last day after day, forever and ever. Don't tell me you're... l'm... Shogun. 2nd Chapter The New Book of Prophecies? There's more. Who wrote it? Not Kenji. Someone else. She's the chosen one. God's Child. Who are you? Yamane is calling me. Stop them or the world will end in 2015. Friend will become God and mankind will perish... l know what this means. You...! l remember you! Another End.
