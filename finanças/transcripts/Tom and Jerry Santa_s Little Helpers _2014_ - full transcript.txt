(THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMING) What are you worried about? You've been nothing but nice this year. (FIRE BURNING) -(CARS HONKING) -(CARS CRASHING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (MEOWING) Might be a good idea to ask Santa for a home where you're a little more appreciated, know what I mean? (SCREAMING) Uh-uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Hey, no one's all bad. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (CRASHING) (SNIFFING) Santa can't eat all those cookies himself. MRS. CLAUSE: Oh, my. I was hoping to find someone to tell me if I had baked in enough Christmas cheer. Well? Splendid. Now Santa's going to need all the nourishment I can bake, if he's going to deliver all those toys to the boys and girls tonight. I think you better try one more, just to be doubly sure. (CHEWING) Taking Santa these cookies. I'll be back for the rest. (SCREAMING) Oh, it looks like we have a house guest. Did you come from outside? Oh, you poor thing. That should warm you up and you must be hungry too. Here you go, kitty, with extra cream on top. (CLOCK CHIMING) Oh, dear, I better put out Santa's soup before he wakes up from his nap. (BURPING) (SNORING) (WHISTLES) (SCREAMING) (TOY GUNSHOTS) (LAUGHING) (BARKING) -(FIGHTING) -(MEOWING) -(PANTING) -(BARKING CONTINUES) Phew! (WHIMPERS) (SNORING) Hey, pal, why ruin your Christmas? And besides, it's better to give than to receive. -Says who? -Says me. (PUPPY BARKING) (CRASHING) (CHOMPING) (SCREAMING LOUDLY) (SNORTING) (LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) The last toy of Christmas! Yay! Hurray! ALL: Hurray! ALL: Hurray! Yeah, alright! 48 minutes, ahead of schedule. (ALL CHEERING) There's only one thing left to do. Hot coa for everyone! (ALL CHEERING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (ALL CHEERING) (BELL TOLLING) SANTA: Christmas puppies to the sleigh. The sleigh is loaded, sir. All toys accounted for. We've checked the list twice, sir. -Reindeer are fed, sir. -(MUNCHING) Hey! Clear for takeoff, sir. Come on, Jer, can't I go with Santa this one time? You've done it again, elves, great work. ALL: All right! (PUPPY BARKING) (TOY SQUEAKING) (SCREAMING) Merry Christmas everyone! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! ELF: We did it. Hip, hip... ALL: Hurray! There's only one thing to do. ALL: Eat Christmas cookies. (BARKING) (SCREAMING) Wait up, puppy overboard! Come back, you're missing Cindy's Christmas puppy. I didn't know cats could fly. (CRASHING) (BARKING) Jingles! We'll deliver Jingles ourselves, that's what we'll do. Who's with me? What? We may be small but we're mi... Oh right. We don't know where Cindy lives. Only Santa does. Maybe Santa will give her something else. She could have asked for more than one thing in her letter to Santa, I suppose. The letter! The letter will have Cindy's address. (SNORING) Hey! We're never finding Cindy's letter if you don't try harder, lazy cat! Did we find it? Wake up, cat! We found Cindy's letter. Her address is on the envelope. See! And we know just how to get it to her too. (CRASHING) Listen, cat. You have to help. Jingles won't go without you. If we can't move you, maybe a little girl can. "Dear Santa, I have tried to be good "but I'm not always good at being good. "I have just one thing that I want, a puppy. (PUPPY WHIMPERING) "Really, it's for my mom. "We had a dog, but she went away. "And we all miss her very much, especially my mom. "If you can't do it or I haven't been good enough, it's okay. "My mom doesn't know that this is the only thing I'm asking for this Christmas. "Merry Christmas, Santa. "Love, Cindy." Hmm, no one's all bad I guess, not even a mean old cat. Want to see how we're getting to Cindy's? Isn't it beautiful? It's Santa's old sleigh. All we need are reindeer. Well, I guess the reindeer are busy tonight. (SNIFFING) I didn't know puppies could fly. It's the reindeer food! It makes reindeer and puppies fly. Now we just need a sleigh small enough for Jingles to pull. Come on, Jingles! You can do it! (JET ENGINE WHOOSHING) (LAUGHING) That was fun! Let's do it again. We made it! Yippee! Are we there yet? (SCREAMING) Best sleigh ride ever! We made it! Yippee! We have to hurry, it's almost Christmas morning. (PANTING) We're running out of time. We have more time than that. TUFFY: Look out below! Wait a minute, why doesn't Cindy have a stocking? (GROWLING) Because we're in the wrong house! (SCREAMING) (DOG SNARLING) (GASPING) That mean old dog has no Christmas cheer. (EXCLAIMS) (BARKING) (BARKING) (CRASHING) (SCREAMING) -Santa, is that you? -(BARKING) What was that? A puppy! Welcome home! ANGEL TOM:Remember Tom, it's better to give than to receive. Mama! Mama! Look what Santa brought us. A puppy! Whoa, and it flies too! We're like pretty good elves, don't you think? But maybe we shouldn't say anything about this to... (GASPING) Santa! I already know! Are we in trouble? Trouble? Why, no! You three have shown what the true meaning of Christmas is all about. Nearly ruining a little girl's Christmas? No, no, no. The spirit of giving. That's not to say your wrapping and toy making skills can use some improvement. But you have plenty of time to work on that, if you accept my offer to become official Christmas elves. Of course, that means living with Mrs. Clause and me in the North Pole. So, what do you say, boys? Ho ho ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
