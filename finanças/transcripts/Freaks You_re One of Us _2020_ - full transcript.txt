He wanted to exchange his headphones, but didn't bring his receipt. - Tough luck. - Right. Then he got super angry, super pissed. FINAL REMINDER There's lettuce on it. Yes, because lettuce is good for you. Doesn't look like it. We have to pay this. Soon. I hate lettuce! Please, it's only two leaves. Daddy is trying hard so that you can take healthy food to school. So... Ouch! What's this? - Batman. - Why is Batman on the kitchen floor? You could also tidy up your mess. Come on, sweet pea. Please. I'll ask about my promotion. Today. Mmm, mm-hmm, yep... So, today? Karl, come on. Daddy... Christ... here. Hey... Sorry about earlier. It was stupid of me. You'll get the promotion later, I'm sure. I love you. See you later. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye, honey. Chop Heaven hopes you'll enjoy your meal. Welcome to Chop Heaven. Thank you. - Hey, boss. - What's up? - I was wondering... - You can't take tomorrow off. I wanted to ask about my promotion. FIT WITH SCHWARZENEGGER Do you know who that is? Rambo? Forget it. I've been working here for three years now and I urgently need the money. "The first step toward success is the willingness to change." Show me that you're capable of surpassing yourself. The drive to sell more than people can actually eat. And a proper smile. Let's start with something easy. Refill the beer taps tonight. You know where the kegs are. CHOP HEAVEN PATIO You can't park here. It's only for... Oh, fuck! Shit. - Any chicken? - What? Have you got any chicken? No idea, maybe. I'm happy to swap. Hey! Piss off. I'll call pest control!

And? The pills, how long have you been taking them? Ten years, twenty? - No idea what you're talking about. - Those little blue ones, that we're supposed to take so that we are like everyone else, without all that fear, sadness, without the anger. Those pills suppress so much more, our true selves. "Our selves"? Yours and mine? Throw them away. Don't take those pills anymore. You'll see who you really are. Then it'll show itself... - Your superpower. - Uh... What's your superpower? Collecting bottles? Do you want to see it? Absolutely. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! No, I didn't mean it like that! No need, I believe you! You're one of us. You don't know it yet. Hello? Hello, uh... There's been an accident. Uh, on the freeway bridge. Um, someone just fell off the bridge... Hey. So? Are you all right? Hey. What's up? Hmm? Come here. Mm. Mmm. I'm here. Have you been to the movies lately? They're always showing these superhero movies. It's only a matter of time until some idiot ends up thinking they're a superhero too, right? Yes, there are people who think that. And they think they can fly and end up jumping off a skyscraper or a bridge. Where did you get that idea? It was just a stupid dream. Do you want to tell me what happened in the dream? I don't remember properly, to be honest. You can talk to me about anything, Wendy. - Yes. Yes, I know. - Thank you. I... Everything's fine. It's nothing. I'd like to increase the dosage of your medication. Just for a while. You know what this therapy made possible. Your family, your job, your home. You really can be proud of yourself. Oh! Shit. NOTICE TO VACATE NOTICE OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE Do you have any chicken left? But you're dead. I saw you jump off the bridge. A truck ran you over. Now you wonder what superpower you have. I know it's a bit much. What's he doing back here? - You see him? - And smell him. - Always follow the mermaid. - Piss off, fleabag! It doesn't look good for your promotion, Wendy. If you can't even handle a bum... Where is your assertiveness? You've got no power at all! If you really want to change something, Wendy, you have to start with yourself. Karl! Why aren't you at home? Why are you so late? I... Where are your shoes? Hey. We traded fair and square. But only for one game! You didn't say that. Right, guys? Nope. Give him back his shoes. And if we don't? Then what? Are you going to hit me? Come on. We're going home. I knew it. She's such a wimp, that woman. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Good night, darling. Oh! Shit! Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Wendy! Oh, shit. - Bye, Wendy. - Bye. Tell me, are you all right? Yes, why? Just because... you're so... Hot stuff, by the way. Sorry, I meant that thing, not you. Well, not that you're not... Yeah. Should I ask you out for a beer, maybe? I have to go home. Ciao. ♪ I promised myself ♪ ♪ I promised I'll wait for you ♪ ♪ The midnight hour ♪ Hey, babe! Still not had a fuck, eh?

Fucking bitch. You need it real hard, you little bitch. You want it real hard, don't you? Don't you? No problem. Right here. Hey! Vegetables suck. Hey. Hey, sweet pea. How was your day? Great, as always. What's that, Mom? Hmm? - Oh! - Is that blood? Uh... Uh, no. Ketchup. Eat your greens. Chop Heaven hopes you'll enjoy your meal. Thank you. Welcome to Chop Heaven. We'll beat your... Hello, Wendy. What are you doing here? What can you recommend? Pork chop, fries, small beer. Wonderful. I'll take it. To go, please. Hmm. You missed our appointment yesterday. Yesterday? Really? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. You know the risk if you stop taking your meds on your own, don't you? I don't know what you mean. You not only put yourself in danger, also your family. Ketchup? Mayo? I'm really worried about you. Honestly. I'm here for you if you need help. Even outside of office hours. Okay? Sure. Chop Heavenhopes you'll enjoy your meal. Bye. Can't you put that kid's stuff aside? We're eating. Mmm. Would you pass me the mashed parsnips, please, Mom? Don't call me that. I've told you that many times. Have you made up your mind? About what? About getting a university degree. I like my job. Your aimlessness is unbearable. My "aimlessness"? Over five billion people live their lives in exactly this aimless way. You're not one of five billion. You are my son. Yes. Yes, and I'm super proud of that. Wendy? Can you tell me what this is? Nope. No idea. To me, it looks like malicious destruction of business property. Yeah? I think it looks more like this modern art stuff. I don't expect Nobel Prize winners here. Not even high school graduates! You are not taking me for a fool! This is coming out of your next paycheck. Forget your promotion. You'll be lucky if... Want me to show what malicious destruction looks like? I'll put your juicy ass through the mincer myself and make a bunch of super chops with it! For fuck's sake. NEPTUNE'S WORLD Hello, Wendy. Hey, what's that all about? If I'd known that you were coming today, I would have... Have you eaten yet? What? No. I've got some bread somewhere. What the heck is happening with me? I... Suddenly I can throw people through the air. That's not normal. That's who you are. It's your true self. This superpower... you're special. Those people out there keep telling us we're sick. They claim they want to help us, but the truth is, they sedate us and make us compliant. Who sedates us? Well, everyone! The politicians, the scientists, the so-called doctors. Your Dr. Stern. They don't tell us who we really are and... hide us from the rest of the world. Because they're scared of us. Of you and me? We're not the only ones, Wendy. How many do you think are out there taking their damn pills? You mean... all the other... psychos? They're not psychos. They're just different, like us. We're one big family. I've already got a family. A real one. Thank you very much. Until they realize what you really are. Why do we have a pool if we can't afford to fill it? For you and your friends. What friends? Mommy. They're kicking us out of the house? What? No! You don't have to lie to me. I won't let it happen. I promise. Come on, let's play. But you don't like soccer. I'm discovering new sides to myself. Okay. That's the goal. Put a bit more effort. Okay. Uh... We'll find it. But don't tell Dad, okay? Amen. I've been thinking... I can see that. Funny. I let you get away with almost anything. All your little problems and escapades. - A young man has to try things out, okay. - Thank you very much for that. I've opened numerous doors for you. But you didn't go for it. On the contrary. I've never asked you to open any fucking doors for me. I'm not like you. Is that so hard to understand? You have to make something out of your life. Or you'll be living in a five-square-meter shithole like your four billion idols. That... That wasn't your idea, was it? It's Mom's. She's not your mother. MISSING! ADMITTED! ADMITTED! Elmar. MUND, ELMAR BORN 10/17/1998 Don't mind me. Fuck! Not bad, your digs. How did you even get up here? You're also seeing that psychiatrist, aren't you? What psychiatrist? Dr. Stern. Ah. No, I don't know her. Guess why she prescribes you those. Um... Yes, well... All right, there were a few... stupid little problems, but that was a long time ago. That's not medication. Those pills suppress your real powers. Yes, well, powers... like... like those in your comic. Okay, well, I'm really open for... For all sorts of games. But I'm not sure I understand what you want from me. Stop taking your pills, you'll understand. Someone's sneaking around in our garden. I haven't seen anyone. Close the window. Yes. Wendy? Hey, stop that bullshit! - Karl is practicing his skills. - Let go of him! Do you want to hit me now? Are those your bikes? Yes. I'll tell my dad about this! Oh, and you think he'll believe you? Have a nice day! Hey, boss. Wendy! Hello. Are you okay? Yes, sure. Absolutely. Of course. I wanted to ask again about my promotion. Right. Well... As I've mentioned before, it requires assertiveness, uh, a positive and charming outlook, and a good... strong... social skills. I have all that. Don't I? Yes! Of course, yes. I won't disappoint you. I promise. - Cool! I'm happy! - Yeah. - Hey, boss. - Huh? You've got something there. - Hey. - Hey. I couldn't sleep the last two nights, and it's your fault. Are you declaring your love to me? I'll show you. Electro Man. That's my superhero name. Electro Man. I see. Here. How is this possible? I'll take you up on that beer now. Yes. Huh? No idea... THE NEW HERO 90 Mega Girl. The Valkyrie. - Yes. - Sounds a bit Nazi-ish to me. Maybe Laser Bitch? - Wait. You're not also able to... - No. Were you bitten by a radioactive spider once? Or did you fall into atomic waste or something? Not that I'm aware of. Well, I've always been different. Harder to handle than the other children. Since I was a baby. That's what my mom always used to say. Before she took off one day. Yes. My parents couldn't cope with me either. It got worse and worse. And when they couldn't cope anymore, they just gave me... away. Maybe we're part of a big plan. Yes, I mean... What if we're really... destined for something really special? Employee of the month? Seriously, I mean... The big question is... What are we going to do with this? - With what? - With our superpowers. "Superpowers" sounds totally ridiculous. Then... super talents. That sounds like a talent show. Our special gifts. Mm. Okay, so people like us, right? They... At least in comics, they always try to do good things. Yes, like chasing criminals, saving the world... eliminating mean supervillains. And where do we find a mean supervillain now? No idea. It would really be awesome if we could change things, right? What are you doing? Wendy, those guys are... Thank you. Electro Man. - Hey. - Hey. I totally passed out. Where have you been? Uh, I was working late. Really? Whoa, crazy hours. We're staying here. - In our home. - Mmm. What's that? Mmm... Mmm... Where did you get that from? Did you rob a bank or something? Yes. Hey, hey, hey... Slow down. Mmm... Shit. Carnival already? I know. It looked way cooler on the internet. It doesn't instill respect, or make me look hot, does it? Cannonball! Ah! Jump in! Whoo! So... you and your five friends were beaten up by a woman? Yes, that's what I said. By one woman? Yes, dude. Sounds extremely plausible. Hey, that chick had some kind of superpower or something. Gentlemen. POLICE And who are you now? So you and your five friends were beaten up by one woman? Are you scared? No, of course not. Don't! Stop! It's me. - What's he doing here? - He's one of us. Electro Man. What? I'm... I'm Electro Man. Show him. Yeah. And you? What's your power? He's invincible. We're safe here for now. Here we can be who we really are. So your plan is for us to hide here and not use our powers at all? If they catch us and we don't behave, they'll lock us away. Forever. Where do you think they're going to lock us up, hmm? There's this clinic. They call it a psychiatric hospital, but it's a prison. For everyone who's different. That would be great for you. It can't be worse than this shithole. That place is hell! I was there for years. To the people outside, we're... degenerate. We have to stay in hiding until the world is ready for us. That's bullshit. We have to help them. We have to free them. The three of us can't just walk in there. That's impossible. Yes, we can. The three of us. We're living proof that all this is possible. They're our family. You said so yourself. Yes. Maybe Stern is right and we're crazy. Crazy enough... to try it. Are you taking off again? Yes, I've got a late shift. Oh, right. Crap, I got us a little champagne. And Titanic on DVD. "I'm king of the world," etc. Oh, what a shame. - Bye. - Ciao. Right, so... Of course every superhero needs a proper outfit. That's why... Take a look. Look. Wendy? A lightning bolt, seriously? How original. Right. This one is for you. Put it on. And this one... And... This here. Well? Sure. Why wouldn't a female superhero dress like a worn-out dominatrix, right? I'm sure it'll look great on you. Tell me, am I jerk-off material to you? What? No. That was just because... - Hi. - HI. Uh, good... good evening. Have you got a powder room I can use? What? A restroom? Uh... Yes, it's in the clinic. But it's not open to the public. But I need the toilet urgently. I can't let you enter the property. Not even to use the restroom. I'm really sorry. Can't you make a teeny-tiny exception? You could join me. Make sure I don't do anything stupid. Anything stupid... What about the cameras? Who's the coolest dude ever, huh? Right... then let's get the others out of here, shall we? Wow. This place is quite the art school, huh? Hmm... The cells are this way. Freaks. It's here. Elmar! What the... Does anyone else want a coffee? - Someone's here. - Someone's coming! On the third floor. Nice! Let's go! Shit! Hey! Stop! Elmar! Come on! - Do as we say! - On the floor! - Shit! - Kneel down! Before Electro Man! And beg for mercy! What's that douchebag talking about? Okay, who just called me douchebag? Stop that bullshit! Hey. Are you pregnant? What? Look. I'm not invincible, but damn, I sure fried those guys! What were you doing? Destroying dudes at the club was okay, right? You can't compare these things. The guards might be dead now! Yes, but maybe they're not. Okay? Be honest, you don't care that they would've caught us if it hadn't been for me. How about a "Thank you, Electro Man"? Quit your stupid Electro Man crap already! What? - We're not in a comic. - I know. People need to know we really exist, that we're real superheroes! We aren't superheros. Fine, I guess you aren't, but the two of us are. We're going to show mankind that our time is... No! Just because you're some walking battery, you think that mankind has been waiting for you? For you? You're a spoiled mama's boy, living at home in his late 20's! You talk about my mother? What do you know about her? I know she messed up raising you! - One more word and... - Okay, that's enough! Because of people like you... they lock us away. All of us. Maybe they're right, after all, Dr. Stern and the others. We can't live among normal human beings. I tried it back then. With my wife and daughter. They ended up paying for it. For my sake. Don't do the same mistake. Poor guy, huh? Yes. Fancy a beer? I have to go home. You didn't go to work. I called them. Are you checking up on me? I was looking for Karl's freaking stuffed animal, okay? Your phone was turned off. What's his name, huh? Who? The toy tiger? Your late-night excursions? Extramarital activity may increase intramarital libido. - Says the internet! - You're drunk. So what? Leave me alone. TRAGIC ACCIDENT MOTHER AND DAUGHTER DEAD AT THE SCENE Mommy! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. Are you getting a divorce, Dad and you? What? No! You never used to argue this much, nor this badly. Some things have changed. "Things"? Or you? Mom, what's wrong with you? I don't know. It scares me. Me too. - I won't call you "Mom" anymore. - Whatever. Because Mom doesn't want me to. Did Mommy finally get in touch after all these years? She's here. She always has been, this whole time. It's about time you go and see your shrink again. This is Mom's favorite piece of music. Morning. Morning. Um... There was something with a co-worker. Mm? - Hmm. - I... But I love you. And I want us to stay a family, you, Karl, and me. Don't you think I want that, too? Anything else you want to say? Mm-mm. No. SCHULZE, WENDY BORN 05/15/1992 ALLERGIES ABNORMALITIES Yes? Excuse me, doctor. You have an unannounced patient. It's an emergency. All right, let her in. Elmar. How can I help you? I've been having a hard time for the last couples of weeks. All these old thoughts have come back. Those strange feelings. This desire, to be destined for something else. For something greater. You know, the old problem. Yes. But are you sticking to your medication plan? Of course, yes. I don't want to risk anything. It may be helpful to meet on a more regular basis again. What do you think? Yes. That would be great. I'm... I'm very grateful to you that... that I can speak so openly with you about everything. Anytime. Happy to help. Um... One more thing. Maybe I just imagined it, but... the other day, this cuckoo chatted me up. A talking cuckoo? Shit, no. I'm not that crazy. - No, a homeless guy, a bum. - I see. And... Well... He was babbling something like... "You're one of us. You just don't know it yet." - All right, thank you. - Yo, enjoy. Hey. Hey. Super bourgeois, right? Yes. Unbearable. It wasn't on purpose. Kids, how about you jump into the pool? That's why we got it. Ah! Are you the clown? The clown? I'm Electro Man. Never heard of you. I only know Batman. Batman? Batman is a rich prick who buys expensive toys with inherited money. He doesn't have any real superpowers. He's still cooler than you. Watch it, chickenshit. I just have to stick my finger in here and... Elmar! Come with me. Are you crazy showing up here dressed like that? Marek... Stern caught him. - What? - Yes. - How did she know...? - No idea. What if we're next? If the two of us stick together, nobody can stop us. KARA THE VALKYRIE Together, we're invincible. You have to go now. Yes, but... Wendy, I love you. Get out. What was he doing in our house? I can explain everything. Okay. Please do. Right. So, I... Well I... I've got these special powers. Well... Like Superman. What? Superman? Can you hear yourself talk? I mean, your doctor said you've been saying some weird... You talked to Stern? She called last week. She suspected you might've gone off your meds. My meds? For years, she's used that stuff to suppress my real self, my powers. At first I didn't believe it. You stopped taking them? Without telling me? Why do you talk to Stern behind my back? You're making out with this leather guy behind my back. - What? No. Elmar... - What do you mean? There wasn't anything? - What a retard! - He's also one of Stern's victims. - You are victims now? - Stern has been lying to me! She prescribed me those! And you believe her! Do you think I'm crazy, too? I'm not thinking anything. Let's calm down a bit. I'll get you water. Hey. Mom! Stop! Please! Don't worry, honey. Mom and Dad just had an argument. A dramatic turn at Neptune's World: Police cleared the vacant water park. A group of illegal squatters was arrested. The path is clear for demolition... I am really worried about you. Now that your fuck babe has left you, you want to take care of your son? We both agreed that it was best to separate. Yeah, sure. Anyway, I'm here for you if you need me. So that you can tell me how the world works? Right? Because you know how it works. Because you're so strong? Bullshit. You need me. You need me to feel strong. It's all about you. It's only ever been about you. When was the last time you hugged me? Hmm? I don't know. Exactly. But I am really sorry. Why don't you just give me a hug, Dad? No! No! Are you mad? Hey! Hello? Can you hear me? His girlfriend left him. It was quite a shock for him. You are out of your mind. But he was right about one thing. We are different than the other seven billion average people. We... We are the future. We're the next step in fucking evolution. - We are the dawn of... - We have to stop. Stop evolution? This damn superhero thing. Hey. This... This is our calling. Elmar, please understand. We can't just... Hey. It's all good. What happened? You had a nervous breakdown. No. Whe... Where's Elmar? We're looking for him. And his father? He went into cardiac arrest. The emergency doctor could reanimate him. He's in a coma. It's for your own safety. Take it off. Take it off! Now! Wendy... Nobody wants to harm you, especially not me. You lied to me. You lied to me my whole life, since I was a child. I didn't lie to you. You didn't? Take me off the drip, and I'll prove you wrong. I was protecting you. Don't give me that "I've only protected you from the truth" bullshit! Not from the truth, from yourself. - It's lies! It's all lies! - Wendy... Remember what you are capable of, even if it hurts. You know what happened back then. Wendy. Are you listening to me? It just can't go on like that. We've talked about this many times at home. Sweet pea, you promised Mom that you would really try hard. "Discipline" is such an old-fashioned, worn-out term. We're dealing with an adjustment issue, adjusting to the teachers, to other students. But most importantly, to our rules. Do you understand, Wendy? Right, then... Let's start with this. Give it back! I didn't mean for this to happen. Of course not, I know that. Why am I like this? Why am I such a freak? You're not a freak. You're just... ill. You have to accept that. For your family's sake. We can help you. If you let us. You're in very good hands here. What's wrong with my wife? When... When can I see her? We've started a new treatment, but it's only just begun. Willfully going off her medication caused a full-blown relapse of her disorder. Right... Bring your son to my practice next week. What for? Events like this may trigger emotional stress disorders in children, especially when there's a family history. I mean, okay, but my son is no psycho. We want to make sure the recent events haven't left a mark on his little soul. Yes, of course. Hello, Wendy. Can you reach out your hand, please? Hey! Wendy, wake up! Hey, it's me. Did you sleep well? Listen, I'm here to apologize for the... Well, you know, for the... Yes. And I've brought you a gift. There you go. It was fucking hard to find this thing on eBay... Yes, hurry up. Well? Okay, listen. No matter what they keep telling you, we're something really special. Hello, can anybody hear me? We didn't choose this, but we have a huge responsibility to everyone here and the world. - We're meant to be together. - Can anyone hear me? One more thing, um... I understand the only thing that ties you to this bourgeois life is your so-called family. - Hello? Can someone come here? Hello? - I will free you... - from your chains. - I have to get out! Yes, that's all. Right... Hello? Hello? Let me out, please! Hello? Elmar? Hey. Strange, isn't it? Is that the end of the world? What? Just because there's no TV or internet? No, baloney. Where's your new book? Pass it to me. I'll read to you. Okay. What page? Mmm... - This one. - Okay. I'll be right back, okay? Then we'll get started. WELCOME - Yes? - Hey! I would have rung, but there's a blackout. Piss off, asshole. Or else? Or you're going to hit me? Great role model for... Fuck! That was a mega hook, wow! Okay. Wendy is your girl, all right, man? I gave it a try. But she's chosen you. Apparently, you're her type. You win. I got it, okay? Right then... Let's shake on it, like real men. Hallway clear. Keep going. Wendy? Go back to your room. We'll discuss everything else later. - Please! - I have to stop Elmar. It's okay. I didn't want this. I wanted to help you so you can live a normal life, like... like everyone else. I'll get you to hospital. No, it's okay. I've tried to kill myself so many times after the accident. And believe me, I really tried. I will finally see them again, my girls. Wendy. All the others... Show them what it means to be free. This is a F-138, a Formula One car. You can't let it go head to head with a big sedan. I only have these two. It still doesn't make sense! It's childish and stupid! You're not even trying. You've got no respect whatsoever. Not even the tiniest bit of imagination! - I don't understand why your mom... - Mom! Oh, hello, honey. How was your day? I wouldn't do that. Don't I get a kiss? Yes. That's what you get for taking your pills again like a good girl. Wendy, listen. We are meant to be together. We... We are the future. We are better people for a better world. You're clinging on to an illusion of normality, your picture-perfect family. Mom! But I will free you from that. What did you do to my mom? You little shit. Now listen to me. Your Batman... is an invention, comics. The real... You could clean up your damn mess for once, sweet pea. I hate it when you call me that. I know. So, who is the best superhero of all times? My mom. Come here, honey. Come here. Come here. Dad! Come here. We'll have a fresh start, okay? We can do it, the three of us. Everything will be like it used to. I would love that. But they'll come for me. We won't let that happen. I can protect you. I know. It's okay, Dad. Mom has to go. She's a superhero now, just like Batman. DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE They say that we're ill, crazy. A danger to society. But in reality, they're scared of us. That's why they sedate us, lock us away. But the real prison is their lies. The invisible wall. And the chains that stop us from being ourselves. But that's over now. We'll take back our freedom. There's a lot of us. More than they think. We live among them, right beneath their noses. In their offices, in their neighborhoods, in their families. And whether they like it or not, we will open their eyes. Together. Because in reality, you, too, are one of us. You just don't know it yet. I heard your psycho mom ran away. She ditched you, just like that. Nice shoes, by the way. Aren't those mine? Hey! Hey, let me down! Let me down!
