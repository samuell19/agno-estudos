Thank you. Thank you very much. - That's fine for me, thanks. - Yes. Yes? You want something else? Corradi! Corradi! Please, that piano. Oh, excuse me, madam. - In fact, you play quite badly. - Oh, God. I do what I can. - You must promise... - You want some tea? - Yes, thank you. Give me the tea. I can't tolerate that man anymore. What did he ever say to you? Nothing. That's the reason, understand? Nothing. Then why did you get offended? - He didn't even return my greeting. - He probably didn't see you. Oh, sure. I reached my hand out to him twice. He turned his back on me twice. 1 even wrote to him. He didn't answer. What do you want to do? I want to ask him the reason for this behavior. Calm down. Don't give in to your usual impulsiveness. Oh, sure. You think that a person can so easily provoke a gentleman? - Where are you going? - I'm going to talk to him. Do you believe in judiciary errors? Madam, I'm a journalist or something more humble. - Oh, Cramoli. Falsely modest. - No. Well, journalist... a searcher of small facts. - A philosopher of chronicle news. - Well, yes. We can say a searcher for shadows of big facts. - How nice. -What is it? - Where is it? - The farm women returning from the harvest. - Very nice! - It's pleasant. - They sing well. - Nice. - It's touching. - Be quiet! Touching! - It recalls a music by Corelli, right? - Yes, right. - Really. - It's true. Yes. They are chants born from the land, like flowers. - They sing well. - They sing very well. - The melody is simple. - Quite. - They come every evening. - Really? - Every evening. - Oh, every evening? - Carlo! - Leda! - What is it? What's wrong? - Carlo! Leda! - Down there! - What can it be? - In the park - Leda. - Someone shot! - Who? What? - Where? - Down there, in the clearing -Who? - I'll go see. I don't know. I heard a cry, - I heard a long cry. - Madam, calm down. - Are you sure? - Calm down. - Calmly tell what happened. - Yes. - While I was there in the clearing... - Well? Yes? Suddenly I heard a shot fired. - But Leda... it's not possible. - And then a cry of pain. Marcello! Mr. Calandri! He was killed on the spot. They must have hit his heart. I was there in the nursery. I heard a shot and a cry. - Then the sound of someone running off. - What was he doing here? How do I know? Or maybe I know. Know what? No, nothing. Do you know anything? No. I don't know anything. The body must not be touched. Run to the villa. Tell them to call the police. Alright. Will you leave me your gun? Why? Why do you want to believe it's something tragic, Leda? 1 looked everywhere around here. I didn't see anyone. - Call Giovanni at least. - I did, dear. I didn't find him. So, will you leave me your gun? Are you afraid? No. - It doesn't have the safety lock. - never put it. Of course. It's better. Carlo! I saw a man talking to Giovanni. - It's certainly him. - Where did you see him? Near the gate. He was far off. I called him, but he started running. - Here he is. Giovanni! Here he is! Come here, Giovanni. Did you hear a cry? -A cry? - Yes, a cry. I think so, but I'm not so sure. Corradi saw you talking to a man near the gate. - Who was he? - A homeless. I told him to leave because he looked suspicious. - Why did he run away? - I don't know, sir. But I think he's a very timid person. - Excuse me. - Oh, here's Marcello. We'll finally know something. -And so? - The journalist said to call the police. - The police? Why? - There, close to the nursery... there's a dead man. - A dead man? - Yes, Excellency. - Who is he? - Mr. Calandri. - The heart? - Yes, Mr. Judge. - At close range? -No. Could you indicate the place the shot came from? It's not easy. But a shell leaps to the right of the person shooting. Just a moment, Mr. Judge. This way, Mr. Judge. - You're sure it was fired from here? - Very sure. You can move the corpse. - Easy. - Pick him up there. - Excuse me. -Come in. - Thieves broke into the Calandri home. - What are you saying? Cramoli just called me. - Thieves? When? - Last night. Where is Cramoli? He's down at Calandri's home assisting the police investigation. We must come out with a special edition! - Call the proto right away! - I"ll go right now. - Very clear. - Yes, it rained last night. Right. A strong foot. And injured. - Oh, Cramoli, you... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Look, the left foot was placed slightly. - Right. It's evident. Let's go visit the studio. - This way, Chief. - Yes. - Nothing was touched. - Oh, right. No, no. The usual thief who robs in the city while the owners have fun in the country. A Summer theft. - I's not connected to the murder? - Of course not! The murder has a precise motive. Jealousy. - Maybe. - Maybe? - I guarantee it. -Yes, yes. - You don't think I'm an expert? - Of course you are! -You come here. -Me? Didn't you notice anything strange? No noise last night? Nothing? - Nothing of the kind? -Me? No. - You are a sound sleeper. - Yes, quite. Tell me, were these ashes in the fireplace here? I can't say. I know nothing, dear sir. I'm a doorman. - What? - Nothing.- There are some ashes here. - Oh, alright. Write. -Yes. Two drawers of the desk have been opened without any trace of breaking in. - Poor thing! - Yes, he was very rich. - Yes, a bank manager. - Calandri, did you know him? - I wonder who killed him. - It is a real mystery. - What an ugly face! - He's unpleasant looking. Let's go. - He has that kind of face. - Absolutely. He must be put on trial. Radio Eco del mondo. Radio Eco del mondo. Radio Eco del mondo. A mysterious theft took place in Mr. Calandri's villa, right after his murder. Police investigation established that the thief was in possession of the key to the service door. It has been confirmed that a desk was opened without breaking in. And that certain documents were taken. The villa's doorman states that also missing is the photograph of a woman from the mantelpiece. We have been informed that, considering the public's emotion for this mysterious crime, the trial will be held immediately. His Excellency, Mr. President. Preliminary investigation for the trial has been brief. The evidence seemed so serious, that after only 20 days following the fact, the accused has been brought before you. A more ample investigation will be conducted now, in front of you, and you will judge. The defendant must rise. You are accused of having killed, with a gunshot, Mr. Adolfo Calandri, manager of the International Bank. I am innocent. And yet you threatened him with death. I just told him that other men's women must be respected. And you didn't add, "You're in danger of death"? You don't want to answer? It is your right. - Excellency, yes. I said it. - Why? Because other men's women must be respected. Why do you speak about women to be respected? I'll tell you. My sister-in-law was working one day in a corner of the park. Behind the woods. She was singing... - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Calandri. - Always cheerful, huh? - We do what we can. Come on. So you admit having a reason for being jealous. - I suspected. - Why worry about your sister-in-law? - Some say you decided to watch her. - It's not true. You will agree that your sister-in-law is lovely and... a bit easy. That's why I watched her. My brother has been in America for four years. Is this weapon yours? It's mine. The weapon has a flaw that permits only who is an expert to put it in a shooting position. 1 always carry it in a shooting position. - It's strange. - 1 go around at night in the woods. Alright. - Show it to the judges. - Excuse me, Excellency, is it unloaded? Please! Please! This is a place of sadness. 1 demand total silence. We are looking for a truth that isn't easy. Take it. Have you recently fired some shots? The truth, Marcello, the truth. I didn't shoot, Excellency. And how do you explain that one cartridge was empty, and that the bullet which killed is perfectly suited to the loader? How do I know? - Are you continuing to deny? - I am innocent. - Alright. Then let's listen to the witnesses. Call Mrs. Leda Astorri. Mrs. Leda Astorri. Is it you? Please come. Good-day. Carlo Linossi, a witness in the Marcello Barra case. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Will you tell us, madam, what you know about the fact? Excellency, I think that Marcello Barra is innocent. You must expose the facts and not give judgement. Is it true you'd been in the park with Mr. Calandri shortly before he was killed? -Yes, sir. I wanted some air and Mr. Calandri accompanied me. Later, I returned to my guests. But he preferred remaining in the park. - He didn't tell you the reason? - No, sir. - He must have been hot. -That is too easy. Please, don't interrupt. So, Mr. Calandri remained. And you? I headed home. Shortly after, along the road, I heard a shot and a cry. And you didn't turn around to look? No, sir. I was terrified. - You didn't think the cry was Calandri's? - Actually... - I thought it. - Why didn't you say it when you got home? | was exhausted from running and from fright. And, after the cry, did you hear anyone running away? No, Mr. President. Had you noticed the presence of a stranger in the park? - I was told later. - But it wasn't possible to find him. - Right. In fact. - He didn't wait. Silence! I don't think I have any more questions. Please, madam, you may be seated. Excellency, will you have the witness, Carlo Linossi, come? He is the doorman of Mr. Calandri's home. Alright. Have the witness come. The jury members must remember that the same night in which Calandri was killed, a thief broke into his city apartment. And after having rummaged through the drawers of a big desk, he left, taking away the photograph of a woman, on the mantelpiece. - Members of the jury, Excellency. I... - Please. Silence! - First take your oath. - Yes, Excellency. - I swear to tell the truth. - Nothing but the truth? That's for sure. Repeat. Nothing but the truth. Nothing but the truth. I don't know anything, Excellency. - Wait to be asked that. -Yes. Attorney! Which question must you ask? This one. If Mr. Calandri was used to receiving women? How do I know? I am a doorman. Of course they came. And did they all come through the main entrance, or even from the small service door? - Even from the small door. - Who had the key? -Me. Here it is. - Were there others? Give it to me. - Yes, Excellency. Another one that my poor master always kept in his pocket. - Alright. Sit down. - Yes, Excellency. Excellency, I'd like the witness to be shown the key that was found in Calandri's garden the evening of the theft. Do you recognize it? Yes, it is the one my master had. Yes. And so, what does the defender want to deduct from all this? I want to deduct this. The theft was carried out by who already had the key, or by who took it from Calandri's body. And that the thief couldn't have been Barra, since he was already under arrest. And I repeat, sir, that Barra is accused of murder. - And not theft. - We're looking for facts right now. Take them to the attorney general. Giulio. Giulio. What is it, Giulio? Nothing. Nothing, dear - You have any other questions? - Yes Excellency, and I state right away that there is no insinuation in my question. Has the witness ever seen Mrs. Astorri? Madam, could you kindly come closer? Come. Please come, madam. Excellency. It's her! The lady in the photograph that was stolen. Are you sure? Absolutely. Did you ever have the occasion, to give a photograph to Mr. Calandri? Never, Excellency. Never. Never? It's a photograph of you. I am not mistaken. - Nothing was written on it? - No, but it's her in the photograph. It must be a resemblance. Mr. Calandri had no reason to keep my photograph in his home. Did Mr. Calandri ever show you a particular interest? No, never. Friendship. Only friendship. But, I repeat, what does this have to do with the Barra case? You see, that photograph was stolen. Doesn't it seem a bit strange? Oh, no! It was in an expensive silver frame. And thieves have always taken such valuable objects. No other useful question? Attorney? - Not for the moment. Thank you. - You may be seated, madam. You, too. Go on. Have the witness, Aroldo Cramoli, come. Cramoli will certainly have important revelations. It seems that he has some accusation elements. - Against who? - Don't know! We'll see. - This Cramoli is fortunate. - Lucky him. Are you Mr. Aroldo Cramoli? From "L'eco del Mondo™? Be seated. Do you confirm what you said? Your deposition? 1 confirm. But I must add some circumstances I didn't reveal, because I wanted to do a personal investigation that I was not able to complete. Chancellor, collect everything. Yes, go ahead. Allow me, first of all, to call your attention, Excellency, to the chain that was found on Mr. Calandri's body. More precisely, hanging on his belt. - This one? - Exactly. Right after the crime, I noticed a key was attached to it, and later it disappeared mysteriously before the investigating judge intervened. Later, during the location check, carried out in Mr. Calandri's villa after the theft, | saw the same key inside one of the drawers of the desk that was robbed. - It's very interesting. Go on. I must also call to your attention that when Giovanni, Mr. Astorri's house help, returned to the city where he had gone by car, looking for a doctor for the lady, he was limping on his left foot. The footprints left by the thief in the garden of Mr. Calandri revealed a strange coincidence, that of limping on the left foot. Interesting. Go on, please. I will inform you of another two circumstances. - Which ones? - This is the first one. I was the first to go to the clearing in the park, and on the ground near the body 1 found a cigarette that was still lit and consumed very little. Probably Calandri's? No, Excellency. Calandri didn't smoke. - Besides, the cigarette was a Muratti. -And so? Well, among Mrs. Astorri's guests, Muratti cigarettes were only smoked by Mr. Giulio Alberti. Miss Dora's fiancé. I believe, in fact, that Mr. Alberti left the living room, very agitated, before Calandri was killed. - Just a moment. A note belonging to Mr. Alberti was found in Mr. Calandri's wallet. Here it is. And the second circumstance? Allow me, Excellency, to answer you after you have questioned Mr. Giulio Alberti and the house help, Giovanni? - Alright. Sit over there for the time being. - The phone, hurry. - Right away. - It's becoming complicated. - Excellent. - There is material for 20 articles. - Hi, Cramoli. - That's for sure! - Look for the woman. Always! - Always! - The press is kindly asked not to make noise. Introduce the witness Giulio Alberti. Mr. Giulio Alberti, they're calling you for a deposition. - It's not my turn yet. - They want you. - Giulio. - Please, Dora. Hello? Yes, L'eco del mondo. So what's new? Miss, stop. So, what is it? Wait a moment. I'll write it. Go ahead. A serious suspicion on Mrs. Astorri. Go on. What? A commissioned murder? Wow! Very interesting! Go on. So, did you know Mr. Calandri? Yes, Excellency. Very ingenious, a formidable organizer. But rapacious in everything, with women, in business. No pity for anyone. Actually, that is how the reports describe him, too. Did you have the occasion to write to him to ask for a meeting? - Yes, Excellency. To ask him the reason for his behavior. Excellency, can you raise your voice? I don't hear very well. Here is an excellent judge for the defense. As long as he's not deaf at heart. Don't interrupt! So, you wrote to him asking the reason for his behavior? - What behavior? - He didn't answer my greetings. - Why? - I don't know. I wanted to ask him. - Privately? - So we could be more free. Do you smoke Muratti cigarettes? - What's that have to do with this? - Answer. Yes, Excellency. When you left the living room, did you go to the clearing in the park on the evening of the crime? Answer. Did you go to the clearing? I don't understand, Excellency, what it has to do... On the ground, right after the crime, a Muratti was found that was still lit. Yours. Yes, Excellency. I went there. - Before or after the crime? - While it was taking place. - I don't know. - It's your duty to tell the whole truth. - The truth, Excellency... When I left the living room that evening, 1 tried to meet Mr. Calandri in the park to ask him for an explanation. And you didn't see who shot Calandri? I couldn't see because the lane's wall was alongside of me. 1 confess that I lost my head, and ran away. You weren't at all curious? You felt no interest in facing such a tragic incident? - I was so shocked... - You didn't tell anyone anything? - No, nothing. - It's strange. Witness Giulio Alberti, do not leave the courtroom. L'eco del mondo! Latest news on the Barra trial! L'eco del mondo! Latest news on the Barra trial! L'eco del mondo! Be seated. - It so seems you don't limp anymore. - I don't understand, Excellency. Didn't you sprain your left foot the evening of the crime? Yes, but it was a slight injury. And this happened before or after going to the city? It happened while getting in the car. - At Villa Astorri, right? - Yes, Excellency. Then tell me how you entered Mr. Calandri's garden. Answer. - With the service door key. - To do what? To remove a photograph that was on the fireplace. And look in the desk drawers for a pack of letters which I later burned. How was the desk opened? With the key that I removed from Mr. Calandri's body, which was hanging on his chain. You were seen talking to a man who'd reached the park from Villa Astorri the evening of the crime. Who was he? Mrs. Astorri's brother. Did he participate in the crime? I am not in a position to say that. - You haven't seen him since then? - No, Excellency. Neither Mrs. Astorri nor | were able to find him again. He disappeared. Did you enter Mr. Calandri's home on your own initiative? No, Excellency. Mrs. Astorri ordered me to do so. I know nothing else. Now is the time to say the second circumstance. In the fireplace ashes in Mr. Calandri's home, 1 found this corner of a burned letter. Please, Excellency, show it to Mrs. Leda Astorri. Please, madam. Come here. - Did you write this letter? - Yes. - I did. I did it. The hearing is adjourned to tomorrow. The attorney general has requested a location check at Villa Astorri. Mud! Mud! Why did you do it? Did you need money? Jewels? Affection? -No, Carlo, no. - What did you give in to? Blackmail. - It was to save my brother. - Your brother? He had used Calandri's name on a promissory note. A false signature? Right. Calandri had me called. I went to him, at his villa. And he received me very cordially. But then... Don't worry, madam, Don't be afraid. We'll find a way to arrange this unpleasant incident. Your brother will not end up in trouble. - I will pay with my jewels, if need be. - Of course not. Depriving your beauty of such a necessary frame. - Are you a gentleman? -Yes. - I am a gentleman, but in love. - What are you saying? In love and unfortunate. And I can't let this chance go by. It gives me a way to tell you how deep my feeling is. - You know I'm an honest woman. - Oh, ivory tower. I know. You know I have sacred duties. There is always a way and time to find an agreement with God. Well, what are you asking? That you come here one day, whenever you want, to pick up your brother's promissory note which I have. I refuse. In that case, I have no more reason to detain you. - Is the Chief out there? - He has arrived. When I ring, have him enter. Here is the key to the little door at the end of the lane. Whenever you want, I will be here every day at this hour. And I will be waiting. And then? Go on. I want to know everything. I didn't go there anymore. I sent him letters, begging him to have pity on me. - On my brother. But he came to the villa. -Yes. And he was brutal with me. He even disgraced me, shouting to my face that Alberti was my lover. That is why he didn't say hello to him anymore. So... I wrote to my brother. I had decided to tell him that the sacrifice asked me was impossible. - So he came. - Where? To the park. We were to have a definitive talk with Calandri. I went out with him, as if to go for a walk. But my brother hadn't arrived yet. So... Calandri insulted me with such violence... And was ruthless with me. When he began being brutal again... You killed him? It's necessary, Leda, that you tell all this to the judges. - Good-day, gentlemen. - Good-day. - Good-day. - Good-day. What did Mrs. Astorri say? She said, "I did it". It seemed like such a banal trial. -You're new at this. -Me? - He's already confessed. - Surely not. - You have a mania for contradictions. -Who? There's the special edition, of course. - The judges may take their places. - Finally. You, to your place. His Excellency, Mr. President. The hearing has begun. Have Mrs. Astorri come in. Please, madam, think carefully on what you're about to answer. What did you mean yesterday by saying, "I did it"? I did it... I shot Calandri. - Excellency. Excellency. - The accused has something to say? No, nothing. Silence! Silence! Or I will have you leave the courtroom! Will you tell us about it, madam? A brief story, Excellency, but painful. - My brother Antonio Bardi made an error. - What error? I don't want to be his accuser. He is weak, but a good person. A serious error. Calandri had evidence, and took advantage of it to propose deplorable conditions. Being silent if I would become his lover. Do you have evidence of this, madam? The evidence is in the letters I wrote begging Calandri. I had my house help, Giovanni, burn them. And I made a mistake, maybe. But in that piece of burned letter that you showed me, there is still a trace of my plead. 1 asked that if I was to be a victim of this blackmail, of this nightmare, till my death. - Did Mr. Alberti know about all this? - No, he didn't. Do you realize the seriousness of your statements? Yes, Excellency. I told the whole truth. The attorney general has no other questions to ask? Mrs. Astorri and Mr. Alberti are to be put under surveillance. Meanwhile, Antonio Bardi is to be found. Does the attorney general still feel a location check is necessary? Yes, Excellency. Then the hearing will resume today in the Villa Astorri park. Where are you all running? You cannot go inside. What do you mean? No, madam. These are the orders. You cannot go inside. But the hearing should be public. Let me by. Madam, what can I say? These are the orders. - It is intolerable! - Alright... We are Mrs. Astorri's friends. Don't insist, madam, because you cannot enter. - Let me by, at least. - There are no preferences. What? I cancelled commitments to come here! Do the conditions of the place seem identical, Mr. Cramoli? They have been perfectly reconstructed. - The jacket, the gun. - In their precise place. Mr. Alberti, would you show us where you were when you heard the shot and the cry? Here, Excellency. Here. Mr. Calandri was walking towards the little lane in front. I remember that he was looking towards the gamekeeper's house. And with his left hand he played around with a chain from which a key hung. - At a certain point he turned around... - Just a moment. - Like this? - Like that, Excellency. It seemed that he'd heard a noise, maybe my footsteps. He stopped, let out a cry and fell. In fact, from my right side, a shot had been fired without my being able to see who had shot it. Because I was exactly in this point. And as you see, the wall covered me. Is that when you tossed your cigarette away? I don't recall exactly, Excellency. But I think so. - Where'd you find the cigarette? - I'll show you, Excellency. Precisely here. And you, Mr. Alberti, didn't hear anyone running away? No, Excellency. There was absolute silence. - But now that I recall... - What? I thought I heard the violent shutting of a window. Barra! You didn't hear that noise? It must have been the nursery door that I was energetically closing. Mrs. Astorri. Please. - So you spoke to Calandri here? - Yes, Excellency. - Where was your brother? - He'd just moved away along that lane that leads directly to the gate. Is your brother taller than you are? - Yes, Excellency. - Alright. So... you removed the gun from the holster. Yes. Can you show me exactly what you did? Please. Leda. Leda. Oh, Leda. No, no, no. You didn't kill him. You can't have killed. Why? Why did you lie, Leda? Why? No, no, don't do this. I am here with you. -No. No. - So... Your brother. Isn't that true? - And you saw him. - No, I didn't see him. I had already left. But he had suffered so much. He had been thrown away from life. And that other one, without any pity, without mercy. There! There! No, no. More to the right. That's it, that's it. Hurry, hurry, hurry. For the president. Alright. A special delivery letter, Excellency. Have you calmed down now? Everything will work out. Why did you do that? Why? Be strong. Be strong. You can go, Mrs. Astorri. - Me too? - You too. - To our room? -Yes, miss. Excellency, my brother is so gentle. Believe me. He is incapable... I know, I know. Go. Go and don't worry. Come. Gentlemen. Antonio Bardi, Mrs. Astorri's brother, killed himself. This is what he wrote. Excellency, 1 write on the verge of death and I swear that my sister is innocent. When the shot was fired, she had already left the clearing. She accuses herself because she thinks I killed him. I am a loser, a man who has fallen in mud, but I'm not a murderer. And death, in which I will finally find peace, witnesses this truth. Antonio Bardi. Does the attorney general have any request to make? 1 confirm accusation against Marcello Barra. And you, Barra? - Do you continue to deny? - Mr. President! I moved away just now, and slammed the door of the nursery many times. Did anyone hear anything? No. Nobody. - Why? - A few moments ago, Barra lied. Because evidently, the noise heard by Mr. Alberti was that of a window. Attention! This one. Yes, now I remember! There's no doubt! It was that window. Someone closed it with violence, Just like now. You. You closed the window that night. And your brother-in-law killed. Isn't that true? You saw him. You saw him. Yes. I'm not to blame. Mr. Calandri was below... and was gesturing something. He wanted to come to me up here. Mr. Cramoli, I'm not to blame. I'm not to blame. Barra. Everything accuses you now. Do you still insist on denying? Think about it. It is my duty to tell you that your confession can have a positive influence on the judges. Radio Eco del mondo. Radio Eco del mondo. The Barra trial ended with the accused sentenced to 20 years. The gamekeeper, when cornered, confessed his crime. He killed because he was jealous of his sister-in-law. For further details, read this evening's L'eco del mondo. L'eco del mondo!
