THE LAST EXECUTION A year's a pretty long time. Will you manage it? If you manage it. I know how important it is to you. Africa is pretty far away. It certainly is. Do you want to marry me? No, I'm serious. I don't have a ring on me, but... Yes. I do. Wait. Give me your hand. It's a Biro ring. It's much better than a real ring. Because after every shower you have to draw it anew. So it's a new decision every time. A decision for one another. - Take care. - Take care. Bye, lads. Hello. Mr Walter. Would you please come with us. - What is this about? - Just please come along. May I ask where we're going? We're not authorized to tell you that. And my flight? My bag is still on the plane. Don't worry about that. We'll take care of everything. Is there a problem with my research posting? You've been designated to take over my professorship. When I retire, that is. What? - Your chair? - Yes. The trip to Ethiopia is no longer necessary. Your thesis was terrific. You were one of my most talented students. Are you serious? Thanks. Mr Hartmann will explain everything else. I wish you the best, Mr Walter. - Thank you. - Best of luck. What? - Congratulations. - Yeah, thanks. Dirk Hartmann. Hello. But first you'll join the HVA, the Foreign Intelligence Agency. - You want me at the HVA? - Yes. You can contribute to guaranteeing continued peace in this country. Horst Langfeld. Have you heard that name? The footballer? Yes, of course. We don't know each other personally, but we both played for Union. He was picked out of the group, went pro... Yes, a superb footballer, even back then. Why? We would appoint you to the football division. - Football? - Yes. We're a great community. Our colleagues and their wives. It doesn't get any better than this. Here. You'll have to read this through, copy it and sign it. - Now? - Now. "Pledge under oath. I... born... pledge to serve the Ministry for State Security. I solemnly vow to keep absolute silence regarding all official information and my official duties, to protect the Ministry for State Security offices and to not provide other people, authorities, or close relatives with information regarding my work." Well... cheers. - To my new position. - Congratulations. Cheers, Dad. What did you keep saying? If you worked in Africa for a year and then really worked your arse off for 20 years, then you might just manage to become a professor in your early to mid-50s, but not before that. - It seems a miracle has happened. - Yes. In a few years I might be initiating new studies. Where are you sleeping now? At Corina's? You don't have a flat anymore. I'm getting a new one. I get the keys later. - That fast? - Yes, it comes with the new job. What is it you're doing exactly? - That isn't exactly clear yet. - Well, roughly? It's complicated. Research, you know. Whoa! Lovely, and with a balcony. The carpet! It's all really very, very nice. - Isn't it? - Yes. No way! Yes. How did you get a flat like this? Connections. Great speakers, right? If you want, this is our flat. Everything okay? Yeah. You're working for the ministry, right? Yes. I wanted to tell you about it in peace. You have to tell me everything. We'll have it incredibly good. The main proceedings of the 1st Military Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of the GDR will, as per Section 211(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, be closed to the public in the interest of ensuring secrecy. As per Section 212(2) all those present are sworn to secrecy regarding all facts discussed at these proceedings. Would the defendant please stand. Please. Your name? My name is Franz... My name is Dr Franz Walter. My middle name is Siegfried. Your citizenship? I am a citizen of the GDR. How long have you been in custody? I've been in custody since January 9th of this year. Store all of your work documents here. - Do you remember your commitment? - Yes. - What is it? - Nothing leaves the office. No papers, no notes, no microfilms, no files. Don't talk about my work. Here's the key to the cabinet. And your seal. Seal it with this every time. Guard it with your life. This engraving is unique to you. Have a good day at work. So how is it to be in the West? You must be the happiest man in the world, right? I couldn't be robbed of my freedom any longer. I'm very happy. I place my talents at the disposal of the Federal Republic of Germany and my club HSV. Yes, and I thank the FRG taking me in. Off! His wife will never get an exit permit. She's under surveillance. I want to know what Langfeld is up to in West Germany. Everything. Get me the names of scouts near Hamburg with access to HSV football club. Morning. I think I found someone. Did you work all night? Panther is down as a licensed internist but was a team doctor for various clubs. He's friends with Liebgold from West German intelligence. Either he has connections to HSV, or he could have them if he wanted. Panther is sociable. Chums up with everyone he talks to. You're really going for it. I just don't get it. Langfeld... I didn't even hear about it. The papers don't have to print everything. The GDR made him great. He's a role model to so many people. That's why he'll come back. I marked presumed links to Langfeld and his social sphere. Are we going to contact Panther? I'm going to meet him, yes. Can I be there? We're meeting in West Germany. It would really interest me. I'd really like to talk to Panther about Langfeld. You can't come along. You're not married. And your father... Are you happy? Yes. Who gives a crap if it's summer. Everyone else waits for summer, not us. - We'll have mulled wine if we have to. - My girlfriends love it. Have you told Bernd yet? Corina, it's our day. It's not good if all of them come. I don't want anything to go wrong. What do you mean? Um... At that time... the work I did... I identified with it politically. I had no experience. And the special bond of trust with my agent handler... was intact. This society sparkles on the surface, below that there's misery like you've never seen. Please sign for it. We're here about Horst Langfeld. I see. We need every detail you can get on him. When? Yesterday. How about tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? Have you met Langfeld? Once, three days ago. At HSV, after the game. - We weren't introduced. I just saw him. - Who was he with? He was having a beer with Renner. Renner plays for HSV, once played for Karlsruhe FC. You're well informed. I play amateur football myself. I heard Renner has quite the soft spot for women. Possibly. How well acquainted did they seem? It was an intense conversation. - Is Renner married? - Married a TV presenter five years ago. This is Bodo Renner. Next Saturday at 10:00 p.m. he'll be in the Four Seasons Hotel with another footballer and will be noticeably drunk. Tell him your half Italian. Say you study in Palermo, grew up in Germany and are visiting Hamburg. His first love was an Italian girl. A brief, intense liaison when he was in his youth. An idealized image of that Italian girl still persists in his head. He still sinks into erotic reveries. Seek initial contact at once at the bar. The red-headed barmaid with the short curls is briefed. Forgive me for having to discuss a few more intimate topics with you. Wear red lace underwear that evening. Make sure the bra straps are visible. Steer the discussion casually towards the differences between passionate Italian and disciplined German women. And I proceed with the evening from there. - Yes. - Got it. Do you have any other questions? No. Wish me luck. Good luck. Thanks. Goodbye. You were good today, Franz. Cheers. - I need some fresh air. - What's wrong? I fell sick. Probably the greasy hamburgers. Sit down. AT HOME WITH UTE AND BODO RENNER Dirk? It's fine. It's fine. Practice makes perfect. - And everyone does this? - Yes. Don't even think about talking about it. We all keep mum. - Can I rely on you? - Yes. Once you're in, you're in. Write a bigger sum on the receipt. I... I got paid out 700 for Panther. He got 500... and I kept 200. And I still have... 50 of it left. We're going to blow it on booze now. And that's for your wife? Yes. Women like that. Is not telling your wife anything hard? - Do you have a problem with it? - No. What's in here? This... This is... cinnamon oil. Our son died five years ago. He was two. My wife always says... that his skin smelled like cinnamon oil. She always has a little bottle in her handbag. Every now and then she takes it out and smells it. It gives her the feeling he isn't completely gone. You know, just a few weeks after someone dies you forget how they smell. Their clothes have no scent anymore. It fades away. Then it's gone. It's just gone. Look, he's taking a nap. - It's time for your nap too. - No. We'll come back again to see the lions get fed. Hello. Hello, Mr Renner. - ...it's not a tiger. - Hello. Do I know you? We want to help you. Hey, Jan, listen, go over there and look at the zebras. Hey. Daddy will be right there, okay? Go on. - Who are you? - It'd be a pity if the press got those. Your wife... It'll change your boy's view of you too. A crack in his basic trust in you. You can't undo something like that. We just need some information from you. About Horst Langfeld. - About Horst? - Yes. Why? I can't do that. He's a friend. We believe your wife is dearer to you. We need to know Langfeld's exact daily routine. Everyone he's in contact with and their addresses. We need information on how he lives, his training schedule and his physical and psychological state. In particular if he badly misses his wife. Nothing more. Dear Bride and Groom, dear parents of the newlyweds, dear wedding guests, as a friend, colleague and comrade I wish our newlyweds a deep love so they can support each other in hard times and enjoy the life this country bestows upon them in good times. Best wishes. I didn't know they invented love too. Yes... Thank you. Congratulations! I'm so very happy for you. - Thanks, Mum. - The both of you! - Where is Corina? - I'll lead you to her. - Here I am. - Come and give me a hug too. Congratulations, comrade. - Your daughter is remarkable. - Yes, she is. - Take good care of Franz for me. - Yes. Mum... - I will. - Congrats, Son. Tell me, why don't I know anyone here? Where's Bernd? - I hope you liked everything. - Yes! Very much. Welcome to the family. Thanks. I really am very happy. You didn't wrap that yourself, did you? Oh my! What's that? Careful! Careful! To our lovely newlyweds from all of us. Two windsurfing boards, so that the two of you can continue to face the storms of life in a favourable manner. - Welcome to the club. - Welcome! Thank you so much. Windsurfing is a dream of mine. How did you know that? Yes, let's drop the floor... the formalities. I'm Corina. This is Franz. - Cheers. - Cheers! Here's to you! Yesterday he dared to score a goal and to elicit cheers from the class enemy. He's insulting our people! And you sit here staring at me. My operatives have done excellent work. We have information from various sources that will be used in a targeted fashion. Measure one is underway. Please, Comrade Schulte. First Lieutenant Hartmann's reports indicate Langfeld has an active emotional bond to his wife, although she has remained in East Germany. Langfeld misses her a lot and is working towards getting her to join him. Based on that, we've set up measure one. By directive, Luisa Langfeld has been diagnosed with cancer. She's getting chemotherapy, which greatly debilitates her. Mrs Langfeld didn't want to inform her husband of her illness, but the doctor treating Luisa Langfeld persuaded her to report her suffering to her husband in a letter. Yes. We assume his physical and psychological performance will immediately suffer, and that the impression his wife has a life-threatening illness will make him consider returning to his homeland. - Excuse me for a moment. - We're not done yet. Stay seated. PERSONNEL RECORD Yes. Are you coming? We're heading over there. That. What? This, a few centimetres. Come on. This way we were here, but weren't. I'll check the bathroom, see what we can do there. YOUR WIFE ISN'T SICK. Franz? - Yes. - I'm nearly ready. Anja called to say how glad she is that we're going to be at the party. Hey! The wind's going to be good the next few days. I really can't wait to try out the boards. Look. Your favourite dress. Cottbus, last year. Do you remember? Mm-hmm. How long do you need? Are you going to change? I need about... yeah, five minutes. Franz? Are you going to put on a tie? Should I help you tie it? For some reason I'm looking forward to this. - I'd like to go. - Why? What's wrong? You want to stay? You wanted me to befriend your people. - I'll come with you and you can tell me. - No, you won't. Corina. Sniff this. - What do you think? Good, isn't it? - Yes. - It's brand new. - Can a man join in? Yes, it's about perfume. We have it because of you. You make us sweat sometimes. Uh-huh. And what do you wear? Chanel! The green one? - You seem to know a lot about perfumes. - I do. A dance? Go and dance. I'm the best windsurfing instructor you could ever imagine. Yeah? I've never windsurfed. We'll change that. I'm sorry. What's wrong, Franz? Everything's fine now. You're lying. One touch! More precise. Fellas! Hello, there! Bernd! Good to see you. Hey, what's going on with you? Do you need another man? Your parents said you didn't go to Africa. No. I have different work now. You got married. There was a wedding. Now you show up here weeks later all down in the mouth. You know... you don't wait until your funeral to invite your best friend. - Bernd! Are you coming or not? - I'm coming. I have to get back. Take care. Mrs Langfeld. - Is everything okay? - I'm not feeling well. - Do I know you? - Pardon me. I still have to talk to you briefly. What was it you wanted from me? Never mind. Hey, there. What's wrong with you? Can't you fly anymore? - Here. Don't forget this. - Yes. For the webbing. - Here. - Thanks. - I learned lots. - You're good. - Thanks. - It really was lots of fun. I thought so too. You're a good teacher. - Thanks. - Till then. - Bye. - Bye. Franz? Yes? I'll come along next time. Yes, do that. From whom must these secrets be kept at all costs? Yes. I was... instructed on that. Those secrets were to be kept from... all external individuals who do not work for the Ministry. To be safeguarded. To be precise, it goes beyond that. I was also... not allowed to talk to other employees about this knowledge. But from what institutions must state secrets be safeguarded? Whose hands should they not fall into? That was a subject of your instruction, but we want to hear it from you. We want you to tell the court that. They... They cannot... make their way into the hands of enemy agencies... or authorities. Specifically... into the hands of foreign intelligence agencies. Fresh breath. That's always good. Yeah. You spoke to Luisa Langfeld. And we are, of course, wondering why you did that. Schulte has seized control of the case. I wanted to take a more active role. Without prior consultation? What did you want from her? Sorry, it won't happen again. Something else for you... Klara. Renner got her pregnant that night. The problem is she wants to keep the baby. Is everything okay with you? Yes, everything's fine. Pregnant women's emotions can't be kept in check. We need Renner on our side. You'll find a solution. The clinic is in Rostock. I can't do that. Getting your mother a last-minute operation could be hard then. He doesn't want to see you again. Renner already has a family. He loves his son and wife. You had sex in a drunken state. I'd still like to speak to him. You won't get another entry visa for West Germany. Then I'll have the baby without him. Imagine the child learning how it was conceived. What its mother did. I can't do it. It'll learn its mother is a prostitute. I'm not a prostitute. Maybe in such a case it's better if the child never meets its mother. - Think it over. - Why are you doing this? For your sake. You don't want a child from that night. You're young, you can have kids with a man you love. Finish your studies. I'm making sure you adhere to your plan in this confusing situation. You're incapable of deciding. Trust me. You don't want a child from that night. You've changed. Lunch is ready. I'll take it. You've been drinking. Yes, sparkling wine. Someone had a birthday. I'll shower quick, then we'll eat. Franz? - Franz. - What do you expect? - I can't do this. - Can't do what? What's your problem? There's one rule and it has nothing to do with us. Yes, all of this has to do with us. Hello, Mum. It's me. Franz. I spoke to the doctor. He said the operation went well. Mm-hmm. Everything will be fine, Franz. Professor Link. Mr Walter. Are you all right? What can I do for you? I want out. I have nothing to do with that. But they'll let me come back here, right? Right? I don't belong there. I'm a scientist. Say something. A few weeks ago I was informed that it is yet to be decided who will succeed me. I thought you knew that. They can't keep me in intelligence indefinitely. I'm surprised how quickly you made yourself indispensable to them. - You're surprised. - Yes. I expected you to succeed me. Then do something! I can't fight them. No one can. CERTIFICATE - Why is it dead? - What? - What? - Why is the bird dead? It was lying in here in the room. I left the balcony door open, it probably... Why did you have it open? Why was it open? Are you mad? Yes? Hello. We're heading over there. Right now. Pack for a night. I'm coming. Why are we going to Langfeld's house? Langfeld is dead. What? He killed himself. We need Renner. Tomorrow morning he has to comment on Langfeld's death publicly. He has to declare that life in the West made Langfeld terribly miserable. - You'll discuss that with him. - I can't. - You can! - We wanted to bring him back! You'll drive that home to Renner. Or I can give Corina some insight into your work. She must be interested in what you do. - She feels lonely. - Stop it! Don't worry, I'd never do anything that Corina wouldn't want to do herself. Damn you! Good evening. Comrade Schulte. We meet Renner in an hour. - These are the forgeries. - May I? Go ahead. "Dear Horst, as you know I'm very ill and you weren't here. I hope you understand what I'm telling you. I've fallen in love with another man who was here in this difficult time. I want to leave you. I wish you the best. Farewell, your Luisa." Hello? Hello? Yes. I had to go. I'm stunned about the sudden suicide of our teammate and good friend. He wasn't really able to settle in here. He drank a lot and often talked of how good his life was in the GDR. He missed it. Thanks. That's all. Your former professor told me you miss your academic work. I'm glad to be able to fulfil your wish. I'm going to enable you to do scholarly work here. The topic: "Inferences from specific operative political measures to win back and neutralize persons who have illegally left the GDR with public impact in the operational area as illustrated by the example of a sports squad". The Academy of the Ministry for State Security wants a paper on the Langfeld case. Good. I want to leave. I just don't know where to go to. Someone died. He killed himself. And I share the blame for it. Hey. I didn't want this to happen. I thought we would be happy. I thought that too. Let's leave together. Yes. Yes, hello? Schulte has deserted. - What? - Come to the office immediately. I'm coming. I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK IMMEDIATELY Franz. We have to get into your cabinet. We need access to all your scouts. What do you need exactly? Schulte defected to the West. Now he's exposing our agents. He is? Müller is losing it. "Off with his head", he said. What? What's wrong with you? Back pain? Oh no, nothing serious. I slept funny last night. I need all access info right away. May I ask what you're doing in my office? We're working here the next few days. There aren't enough offices for everyone to work simultaneously. - When do you stop working? - When the next shift tells us. Due to the current situation we're working 24 hours a day. It was clear to me that I... would be put before enemy agencies. - You had materials for that purpose. - Yes. - So you wanted to reveal who you were? - Yes. If I had made it to West Germany I would have proceeded to a police station there and I... I would've revealed my identity and let the police take further action. - The police? - Yes. - Are you that naïve? - No. What I mean is the police would've taken me to the intelligence agency. What would have awaited you then? What would have awaited me... is that I... would've turned over the official documents I'd have had and I would have had to disclose my operative knowledge. "Had to"? Had to. In light of the fact... that there would have been no going back, and... because I couldn't awaken any suspicion so as to ease the process of receiving support in a professional activity. Moreover, and this is the main reason, through my activities as a patriot and my missions in West Germany, I'd be guilty of a crime. Thus, in doing so, I would be able to avoid prosecution. Did you "have to" or "want to" commit treason? - I saw it as a "have to". - You have to finish what you start. As prosecutor I find it hard to follow your reasoning. You mean my original idea... Well... my motive was not to inflict damage. Although I am aware that when actually taking a step like that... Was it only about being able to research? - No, not about research... - Well? What then? First of all... it was about running away from my problems. In that sense it's correct. I did have... thoughts... about engaging in research, about doing such work. That is just to... do scientific work. Researching to damage the GDR, to which you owe all that you are now, by colluding with the enemy? Yes? - Hold on. You can't... - Come with us. - Come on! - What is this? - Come with us. - Cut it out! Stop! Left. Come along. Empty your pockets and get undressed. The ring. Strip naked. Bend over. Could you please turn off the light. Would you please turn off the light. Sleeping position! Where is my wife? How is she? Your wife's apartment keys. Your wife confirmed receiving gifts from the West, from you. Moreover, she's on record as saying that due to your increased drinking you were losing control of yourself. That is just a fraction of what she told us. Are there things you've kept secret? No need to tell you that the evidence is irrefutable. Is your crime linked to Schulte's desertion? No, I just wanted to go. Stop it! Well? Now do you recall your contact at West German intelligence? I had no contact with West German intelligence. Who was your contact at West German intelligence? I had no contact with them. Come on now. Admit you had contact with them. I had no contact with them. We have very different information. I have news for you. For several months now your wife has been having an affair with First Lieutenant Dirk Hartmann. She wants to pursue that further and file for divorce. Who was your contact at West German intelligence? When were you to cross the border? I never had contact with West German intelligence. Right. We've been waiting long enough for a voluntary confession. You clearly don't appreciate our friendliness. Your wife's declaration of commitment. Take a very thorough look at it all. I know your methods. It happens that we oblige wives to work for us. It usually doesn't cause a conflict in their marriages. HVA employees don't usually go astray, so their wives have nothing to report. Thus, they avoid inner conflict. You, of course, are a regrettable exception. We have to praise your wife. After some brief initial difficulties she cooperated with us superbly. A very quick mind. As you became ever more dangerous she saw it as her duty to work with us. Corina's parents raised their daughter to appreciate socialism and the leading role of the party. - I don't believe you. - Oh, really? It doesn't make any sense. Spouses are far too loyal. If it's a happy marriage, perhaps. We were worried when you lost it because of the dead bird in the bin. An insignificant trifle, sure, but a completely irrational reaction. Bugging the flat is simpler and safer. Not if you know how to use a record player. You felt partly to blame for Langfeld's death. Your wife is an excellent informant. What are the two of us going to do now? I'd like to take a drive somewhere with you. Come on. Hello. My name is Schreiber. I'm defending you. Can you tell me where my wife is? No. - Can you tell me how she's doing? - No. The trial starts in seven days. We don't have much time. Please find that out for me. I'll try. What evidence do they have against me? Your falsified receipts, but those are merely a trifle. What's more serious are the documents you took from the safe and kept at home. But that's it. There is no other evidence. My guess is the prosecution will petition for five years in prison. His political stance is characterized by a conception of Marxism-Leninism as a rightful working class doctrine, yet he has no personal connection to it. He succumbs to enemy arguments, and he takes the position that, as a scientist, he is above it all and can live wherever he wishes. In a socialist society no one need become a criminal. Those who commit crimes all the same must answer to society. A person such as the defendant, who adopts the stance of our enemies, goes against our state, against our socialist order, against the security agencies that protect us and would betray his class comrades and comrades-in-arms should not be surprised to be treated as an enemy and to feel the full force and severity of our law. Your Honour, applying the full force of the law that is justice, and it is a social necessity. We owe it to our workers, for their peaceful reconstruction, and to the members of security agencies. For the reasons that I have presented, I request that the defendant be charged with preparing and committing a heinous act of espionage in concomitance with desertion and be sentenced to death as per Section 97... No! - Oh no! Oh God! - ...of the Criminal Code, espionage. - Oh God! - And as per Section 54. And, as per Criminal Code Section 58(1) and 58(3), I ask that the defendant have his rights as a citizen permanently revoked. Thank you, Chief Military Prosecutor. Defence counsel, your closing arguments. Judges of the military hearing of the Supreme Court, Chief Military Prosecutor, the objective severity of a crime is determined on the basis of potential and actual damage. That the potential harm in this case greatly endangers the security of the German Democratic Republic need not be discussed, as that is incontrovertible. Insofar as the gathering of documents represents espionage, I have nothing more to add. That offence has been committed. One cannot, however, when stipulating legal action due to criminal liability, not overlook the fact that no material, not a single document, fell into the hands of the enemy. One should also not overlook that the defendant has disclosed everything. I ask the court to review the chief prosecutor's petitions and to refrain from sentencing the defendant to the death penalty. Does the defendant have anything to say in his own defence? I'd like to say... that I am aware that I have committed a serious crime. My wife, Corina Walter, was at no time guilty of any transgression. I ask... that the high court, when reaching a verdict, grant me the chance, to provide one last opportunity, for a life... for me to set up a life in which I can completely... adhere to the social and legal norms of the German Democratic Republic. That was your last word? Yes. Dear... Corina, this is most certainly a mistake. I'll get... out of here. And then we'll go... to the... Baltic Sea... and go windsurfing together far out into the sea." But I'll get out of here. Right? What about my appeal for clemency? I'll take care of it. Dead.
