(light guitar music) (people chattering) (light guitar music) Bermuda tape, day nine. I'm outside the house. Party's going strong. (light guitar music) (people chattering) Such a lovely party, Mrs. Trice. Oh thank you. (waves crashing) I just adore tutti frutti! (laughing) (waves crashing) John dear, the ambassador. Transfixed by Sonia's charms. Oh, go rescue him! And the best part of the whole thing is, your mother-in-law will live in Hong Kong! (guests laughing) I guess you know that Phyllis and Oscar were married and then divorced and then married again. (guests laughing) The divorce didn't take! (guests laughing) (light guitar music) But I don't know why, but I did sail from the great Bahamas. And I can only tell you that the water was quite rough. Well, they had to lash me to the bar! (guests laughing) But I lost at gambling, I really did. I dropped a bundle at the tables. And you know, it isn't as though I don't pray, but sometimes I think God doesn't cover the Bahamas! (guests laughing) (suspenseful music) Darling? When you realize that the Aruba hate the Boujeanboulle. (suspenseful music) And the Boujeanboulle hate the Watusi. And the Watusi despise the Pygmies. (guests laughing in distance) Darling? I don't why a real leader, probably always looking up their BVDs. (screaming loudly) (laughing) (suspenseful music) I said it before and I'll say it again, sticks and stones may break my bones, that's why I never get into fights. (guests laughing) (suspenseful music) And if you're going to the moon, be sure and get that window seat. (guests laughing) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (gasping) (suspenseful music) (kids yelling) (Mariachi music) Acapulco tape, day one. Two weeks since Dina Hunter was released from the hospital and cleared of manslaughter charge. It's rumored she settled close to a million dollars on the family of the man killed in the accident. Mr. And Mrs. Hunter and her jewels now departing ship. (Mariachi music) (kids yelling) (Mariachi music) (boat motor humming) (Mariachi music) (car engine starting) (engine rumbling) (sensual jazz music) (birds chirping) Senora, Senora, it is so good to see you! When we hear you were hurt, we prayed for you. Muchas gracias, Amalia. It's good to see you, Amalia. (birds chirping) (light jazz music) Have this taken down, Amalia. But, Senora. I don't like looking at strangers. Yes, ma'am. (suspenseful jazz music) The Hunters are at their villa. Everything on schedule. It's taken three years, but worth it. Bermuda set-up was chicken feed compared to this. (light jazz music) (speaking foreign language) Is there anything else we can do for you? No, no thank you, Amalia. I'll call if I need you. (speaking foreign language) (light string music) (suspenseful music) Acapulco tape, day one. The Hunters are gonna be a bit of a challenge. One thing, there's a staff. Amalia Common, Maria Lena. Victor, the chauffeur. And there's Dina, very pretty, very protected, but very vulnerable. (suspenseful music) (light tropical music) (boat engine rumbling) (light tropical music) (boat engine rumbling) Lady, do you mind? Those are my clothes over there. I am skin diving for real. Alright now. It's safe. About 30 seconds later we might've met face to face. I'm usually not this unconventional. You shouldn't dive alone, there's a strong undercurrent here. I don't know so, I just moved here. I'm watching the Pierson place while they're away in Europe. It beats paying rent. I'm Carter, Paul Carter. Don't bother to introduce yourself, the grande Senora Hunter. There's been a lot of talk about your coming home. I'll wear swim trunks next time, just in case we bump into each other again. Not very likely. So long, neighbor! (suspenseful music) Contact established, more or less. I don't know if it's millionaire snobbishness, or because she was just let out of the hospital, I'll just have to wait and see. Look, George, I've been working on this San Cerise project for months. I think it deserves more than a casual glance. But I gave it more than a glance. Now, you know I haven't rejected it and it could work. But on the other hand, if you just sit on that same property, it could double in value. Double it hell, I'm talking about a source of primary-- I know, I know, but that land's at a premium and things are going to get better. Sit on it. I don't wanna sit on it. We've been sitting on it ever since Dina's father died. I wanna move! We've been sitting on it ever since Dina's father died. I wanna move! I wanna move! I wanna move! I wanna move! I wanna move! (dreamy suspenseful music) (screaming) (car crashing) (glass shattering) Dina! Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay, Honey. What do you think we oughta do with that land? Land? The San Cerise cove project. George thinks we oughta sit on it. Oh, well I'm sure George is right. Dina, there's been a lot of time and effort involved. I think we should move. Jerry, you do what you think is best. Do whatever you want with it. Look, I know you don't like me to say this, but after all it is your money. I'd just like to know what you think. Dina? I really don't care, Jerry. Do whatever you want to. Just like that? Just like that. She really isn't herself is she? You don't know the half of it. I'm sorry. I thought she'd gotten over the accident. Physically she has. And she's still haunted. Well, this could be very good for her. I mean, a month or two in the sun, the sea air. Do her the world of good. I hope so. Goodnight, George. I'll see you tomorrow. Say goodnight to Dina. (door closing) Said goodnight to George for you. I'm sure George understood. You just weren't with us, were you? It was our first dinner here, Jerry, it wasn't a board meeting. We had to make a decision, important one. Why did we come here? What do you mean? Are you going to spend all your time wheeling and dealing? Honey, I love you, remember? And I'll help you. The doctor says you've got to help yourself first. You've got to get involved again. You gotta go out and meet the world. Laugh at it and fight and be a part of it! Jerry, I just don't know. Dina, this project is for us both. I mean, I was just a beach bum who married money. Well I'm not anymore. I want things to be ours, not yours. I want our money and our family. That's why I've worked so hard in San Cerise because I want to make things happen. Jerry, I'm frightened. Of what? Of your turning into the kind of man my father was. You mean rich? No, no, driven. Compelled to push hard or make money no matter who it hurt. My mother died miserable. My father died running. I was running too. Trying to either get away or catch up, I don't know which. And then I was at the wheel of a car. And I couldn't stop. (tires squealing) (screaming) Faster and fast-- Dina! You've got to forget. You've got to make yourself forget. Nobody's going to do it for you. I'll try, I'll try. Okay. Listen, tomorrow night I'll take you Las Brisas for dinner. Okay, just the two of us. I promise, no talk about work. Okay? Okay. (dramatic music) Hi, neighbor. You're not gonna stand there all afternoon, are ya? If you are, that'd be alright. Well, you're full of surprises. I'm not rising from the sea. I'm bearing my inner soul on canvas. Would you like to buy it? No. No, a lady says no. I'll you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give it a little bath. Why did you do that? Why not? I'll never finish it, not now. You're used to cutting people down to size, aren't ya? No, I just don't arrogant men. As bad as arrogant women? Would you pose for me? What kind of pose? Stark naked, dripping in jewels. (both giggling) Seems to me, Mr. Carter, that you're the one who used to cutting people down to size. Well that makes us even. Why don't you call me Paul then? Alright, Paul. I always thought artists had total recall. Oh, we do, we have total recall. Then why the memory box? [Paul's Voice On Tape] Acapulco tape, day one. There's nothing as dull as my daily routine. Day one, I thought you'd been here a while. I started counting yesterday when you got here. Would you like to go for a swim? I've got trunks on today. I do. Come on. (waves crashing) (sensual jazz music) Hi, again. Oh, oh! Paul! (dramatic music) Senor? We are not quite ready yet, Victor. Did the Senora say when she'd be back? No, Senor. You don't where she went? No, Senor. Alright, I'll give her a few more minutes. Si, Senor, I'll wait in the car. Okay, thank you Victor. (dramatic music) (laughing) Now you say yes, or else. Yes to what? That you'll pose for me. Yes, I'll pose for you. You promise? Yes. Now, you promise? Yes. You understand that my husband will have to approve the painting before we buy it? Yes, I expected that. Just as long as you understand. (sensual jazz music) Dina? Senora. Oh, it's a beautiful day, isn't it, Jerry? If I'd known you were going down to the beach I would've gone with you. Ah, I'm sorry, I thought you were busy. Yeah I am, I've got a meeting, but I would've enjoyed a dip in the bay, but now I'm late. Jerry, haven't you heard? They have fiestas down here. That's a luxury only the natives can afford. Darling, I do believe you're becoming a snob. No, I'm sorry, no siesta now. This meeting might take all day, okay? Alright, you have your meeting, but don't forget our dinner date tonight. Yeah, I meant to talk to you about that. You promised. I know, I also promised to finalize the San Cerise project, that means working on it with George tonight. He's leaving town. Well, I'm sorry, I mean if I-- I know, but this is supposed to be a vacation. I wanted us to spend it together. I know, if you just let me get this out of the way-- I need you now, Jerry! Not tomorrow, or the day after, now! Okay, I'll see you in a couple of hours. Jerry? What would you do if I didn't invest my money in your project? I'd still do what I think is right for both of us. (dramatic music) She's interested, no doubt about that. But it's gonna be a lot tougher than I thought. A lot tougher. She's nobody's fool. One thing I know for sure, the next move has got to be mine. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (slow dramatic music) Will it be ready Friday? Yes. Oh, excuse me. (glass shattering) That takes care of a good bottle of wine. Sorry. Dina? Dina? Come on, I'll fix you a drink. What'll you have? Scotch and water. Hi, didn't I tell you she was sensational? Flatterer. Paul Carter, this is Dina. Dina. Amalie! There'll be four for dinner tonight. George'll be here in about 15 minutes, so say about half an hour. Si, Senor. Paul is a neighbor of ours, he moved into the old Pierson place. We bumped into each other in town, literally. I'd swear I know him from somewhere, but he says no. Well, I've been telling him about our hospitality, why don't show him and I'll freshen up. Why, Paul? I said I'd see you tomorrow. I couldn't wait for you. Don't play games with me. Is that what you think I am doing, Dina? I don't know and I don't think I want to know. Do you understand? Yes, you're coming through loud and clear. Tomorrow when you sit for me, wear those earrings. They're perfect for you. Elegant, beautiful, and ice cold. I don't think I will Mr. Carter. As a matter of fact, I don't think we need a painting at all. Of course we do. You threw your portrait out. I think it's a great idea. Well? I'll think about it. Mr. Carter, do you know that area around the San Cerise cove? I've heard of it, I've never been there. Nothing quite like it, Paul. Well, you've done a great job. The more I study it, the better I like it. A toast to the San Cerise project! Dina? What? We're toasting my project. You have the final say. Any objections? To San Cerise. Honey, if you'll excuse us, George and I will have a little discussion, wrap this-- Don't bother, dear. I'm sure Mr. Carter won't mind having his coffee on the patio. No, of course not. Paul, before I forget, we're having a little reception tomorrow night, Las Conchas, I'd like you to come. I'd like that, thank you. (dramatic music) Well, first of all, a Mexican citizen has to be the major stockholder, it's the law. Good, fine, get one. Make sure he's cooperative. (dramatic classical music) You're an unusual man. You know when to be quiet. Maybe it's because I don't have anything to say. I get this feeling that you're trying to play me. I don't know what gave you that impression. But I've had the wrong impression about you. I had you sized up as rich, beautiful, and spoiled. But you're not anything like that. Just married. Married, oh I haven't forgotten that. What kind of a man is he? Jerry? Oh he used to be a lot like you. Used to be? People change, that's inevitable isn't it? He isn't what he seemed at first, but then who is? How did you meet him? On a beach. I'm very big at beach pick-ups. It was three years ago. My father objected of course, so that made it perfect. Whirlwind romance, instant marriage, and now he's all wrapped up in business. Do I sound disloyal? No, just disillusioned. Well, somebody changed. Maybe it was me. I don't know. After my accident, they say that your whole personality... (shrieking) What's wrong, Dina? I don't know, why am I talking to you like this? (dramatic classical music) No. Dina. No! Paul, just go away, will you please just leave! Say goodnight for me. (suspenseful music) Paul seems like a pretty nice guy, doesn't he? We don't know that much about him. Well, he's a relief from the Medicare set we usually get down here. Let me put that away. Let's not talk about him. He must be a pretty fair artist, otherwise he couldn't afford to live down here. You want me to pose for him then? Sure, why not? Honey, I think this San Cerise project's gonna be wound up in about 24 hours. Kiss me. What? Kiss me. (dramatic music) Paul? Paul? (suspenseful music) [Paul's Voice On Tape] Acapulco tape, day two. I spent this morning keeping watch on the villa from the beach. Doing the painting for bait. Here comes Dina now. Accidental meeting with Jerry Hunter went perfectly. But after dinner it didn't go so well. Reflecting on the events so far, my conclusion, have to move deadline ahead. I don't know whether Dina will sit for the portrait after what happened. Can't risk waiting for the opportunity to get in the house alone with her. I'll have to be at reception. The set-up is similar to the one in Bermuda. (tape clicks off) (car engine rumbling outside) (quick suspenseful music) (slow dramatic music) (quick suspenseful music) (tires squealing) Two hours, two hours in that closet waiting for him to go to bed. I thought I'd lose my mind! I can imagine. But you say there's nothing you can do. Senora Hunter, you are a very valued resident here, but Senor Carter is an American citizen and to arrest him without evidence, what does your husband think of all this? Hmm? You've told him, of course. No. And the tape recorder you mentioned, pity you couldn't bring it with you. It was all I could do just to get away! Oh. Senora Hunter, do you wish to make a complaint against Senor Carter? There would be a hearing in which you would have to testify. Very well, I'll make some inquiries, wire the American authorities, see what is known about this man. It will take some time, of course, perhaps a few days. At the reception tonight, I'll wear the emeralds he's after. Will you be there? I was expected elsewhere, but I'll come. Thank you. And may I wish you a speedy recovery, Senora, from your accident. Most unfortunate. It takes time to recover from such a shock. Well, I've had time, Commissioner. And the injuries were physical. My apologies. I had heard that you were still unable to bring yourself to drive a car. A natural reluctance, of course. But perhaps I was misinterpreting the reason. (sighing heavily) Pedro, (speaking in foreign language) Si. (slow dramatic music) I'll drive. (slow dramatic music) (tires squealing) Yes, George, yes I know you've got important business in Washington. Sure I can handle Senor Larosa. He'll be at the reception tonight. Yes, I know he's the key and we'll the okay from the Planning Commission. Sure, Dina will be there. She'll be a great help. Blondes are scarce down here, you know. Yeah, she's not home now. I don't know where she is, probably getting her hair fixed. Okay, I'll tell her. And listen George, I appreciate everything you've done. Okay, I'll call you soon. Adios. (fireworks blasting) (Mariachi music) You said you'd never wear your emeralds in a public place again. I needed them. Well, you both look like a million bucks. Thank you. Paul, how are you? (Mariachi music) Good evening, Commissioner. Senora Hunter. He's here. We know he's here, Senora. He doesn't take his eyes off me, he just stares. You have that effect on every man here, you look exquisite. I'd no idea you were so gallant, Commissioner. (slow jazz music) Dina, we've gotta talk. Jerry, come dance with your wife, come on. (speaking foreign language) You're determined to foul me up one way or another, aren't you? What? Larosa's the one guy down here that can guarantee the San Cerise deal. Jerry, Jerry darling, they don't do things like that down here! Parties equal fun, not business. I want you to dance with me. (slow jazz music) (upbeat tropical music) (clapping and hollering) (upbeat tropical music) Dina, what the hell do you think you're doing? I think it's time we both play it cool, don't you? I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. Dina. (upbeat tropical music) Bravo, Senora, great performance. Carter, did you see him, he was watching me. We were all watching you, Senora. No, he was watching this, this is what he wants! But he's gone. Well he was here! Watching, stalking me all the time I was dancing. And then he left. Senora, I was watching him. You're wrong! You're wrong! Senora. I'm sorry about my wife, Senor. She's not at all like that. Your wife is disturbed, Senor. Very disturbed. (party guests laughing) (suspenseful music) (shrieking) (suspenseful music) (crowd chattering) Senora, Senora Hunter. Dina. Dina. Paul, Paul Carter, he was here! What happened? Senoras, por favor. What happened? Oh, he's trying to kill me! He wants to kill me and steal my... But you still have them, Senora. Dina, what are you talking about? He was here! He was here! We'll search the grounds. What is all this? You have my deep and very real sympathy, Senor. What is all this about Paul Carter? My men will search the grounds, but... But what? He left some time ago. It seems that your wife has some kind of obsession about this man. (sobbing) Dina, come on, let's go. Come on. Vardy doesn't believe me, does he? Nevermind about Vardy. Jerry, he was here! Paul Carter was here. (sobbing) it's very important that you believe me. I believe you, Dina, come on now let's go. (sobbing) Come on, I believe you. (sobbing and mumbling) (quiet jazz music) I'm afraid the help is still at mass, Doctor, I'll drive you back to town. Thank you. Do you think Dina should be left alone in the house? The sedatives I gave her, she should sleep another two hours at least. What do you think is really wrong with her, Doctor? With all respect, Senor Hunter, I suggest you call in a psychiatrist. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (slow suspenseful music) Amalia? Jerry? (slow suspenseful music) One way or another, I'm going to do it now. (slow suspenseful music) Amalia! Sophia! (suspenseful music) Amalia! Victor! Anyone! (suspenseful music) Dina? (suspenseful music) Dina! (suspenseful music) Dina! (suspenseful music) Dina! (quick suspenseful music) (engine starting) Dina! (tires squealing) Dina! (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (engine roaring) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (barriers crashing) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (metal crunching) (shrieking) (suspenseful music) I was gonna call the police. The car was gone, you were gone. I killed him. Kill what are you talking about? I had to, Paul's a murderer. Was, New York, Bermuda. For the jewelry. Carter, you're talking about Paul Carter. He came today. He must've watched you leave the house. I tried to hide and then he came to the back of the house. I ran. I took the car, but he chased me along the cliff road. So I killed him. I just turned the wheel and he was dead. That poor man lying there. Dying and I killed him! Dina, we're going back, he may still be alive! Jerry, I killed him! (sobbing) I killed him! I killed him! (sobbing) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) Not there. It's blood, he must be around here somewhere. Here's his tape recorder. [Paul's Voice On Tape] Dina, you've got to listen to me. If I can't talk to you, I'll leave this tape recorder with Amalia. Now listen, in case anything happens to me, give this to the police. All the evidence is here on tape. Now listen carefully. You're wrong about me, why I'm here. The girl who was murdered in New York, his first victim, was my sister. I've been trailing him ever since. I almost caught up with him in Bermuda. I even found an earring he lost getting away. That was three years ago, but Dina, it's Jerry, your husband, he's the murderer. I've got to convince you. One way or another, I'm going to do it now. (tape clicking off) So that's where I knew him from, Bermuda. Don't look so shocked, my dear. It's too bad really. For a while I thought about stopping, after I missed on that first try. You know, those brakes didn't fail by themselves. But then I was afraid another accident might raise suspicions. But for all that money, being that close to money, but never really having it, like some puppy on a leash. Three years I waited and planned. Jerry, you'll never get away with it. Paul's gotta be around here somewhere. He's somewhere in these rocks. And I hope he's not quite dead yet, because I wanna thank him personally. See, there'll be another banner headline, jewel murderer Paul Carter dies with his final victim. If that's any comfort to you Dina, you can take that thought with you, that you'll definitely be his final victim. Jerry, you'll never get away with it. After you've accused Paul of being the murderer in front of all the people in Acapulco practically? No, it's gonna be Paul and you over the cliff. In one final death struggle in a speeding car. And then it's ended and I'm home free. Paul! Hello, Paul. I don't think you're in any condition to argue. (grunting) (suspenseful music) (thumping) (yelling) (explosion blasting) (dramatic classical music) (upbeat tropical music)
