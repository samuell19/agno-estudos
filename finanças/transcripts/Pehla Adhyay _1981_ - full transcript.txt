The First Chapter Look, some pages are missing from this one. Someone must have removed them... Leave the book here, I'll report it. But I need it now. If it works for you, take it. It's such a big library, you should take care. Students remove pages... What can we do? What's its use? I told you, I'll report it... Leave the book here. Where's the complaints book? It's right here. Listen...bring me a tea. - What's going on? - Nothing in particular. I went to the library...no work done. I haven't done any work for one week... ...the chapter needs to be finished this month... ...my professor is already very annoyed. My chapter isn't going anywhere... I'm stuck. Why? Anything in particular? No, I just can't find some documents. OK. Hello... Any news? All fine. ...how are you? I haven't seen you for ages. That's not true, I was here all the time. How's Banerjee? Wasn't he hospitalized? Yes, he was badly injured... ...but now he's fine...I met him yesterday. What happened to Banerjee? An accident...One hand had been fractured... What's going on? Nothing... What's the matter? Are you coming for tea? Now? I just arrived... I've been at my uncle's place. So what? We'll be back soon. OK, let's go. Sit down for a minute. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? I'm fine, how are you? Fine. Where were you going? Nowhere, I just came here... ?to the department? ?to see the professor? ?I had some work to do. Did you meet him? No, he's not in the room. Your professor is very busy. Did he go somewhere? No, he just stays here. There probably is a meeting. Is your thesis finished? The final draft is getting typed... ...some footnotes are also pending. Shall we have tea? No, I've just been to the canteen... ...I had too much tea... ...were you about to have tea? No, it just occurred to me. Where are you going now? I'm going to the library... ...there's some work to do.. Are you going back? Yes, I'd come to see a girl... ...do you know Sharyu? OK, I'm leaving, I'm in a little hurry. - OK. - Bye bye. Sir, one minute... ?I feel, whom we call court historians? ?you have tried to justify their existence. - Excuse me sir. - Hello Ravi. You were late for the lecture. Yes, I had some work in the library. Sir, did you see my chapter? Your chapter? My first chapter? I had given it to you. Yes, I'm so sorry. I didn't find the time. I'd taken it home for reading, it remained there. OK sir, it doesn't matter. If you've got another copy, then please give it to me. The previous one got misplaced somewhere in the house.. Give it to me if possible, I'll look into it shortly. Fine, I'll bring it. Is there any other problem? No, everything is fine. See you in my room. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. - What are you going to do this evening? - Nothing, anything special? Yes, at four o'clock there's a meeting at the assembly hall. What's the meeting about? - Students' association. - If you're free, definitely come. - Sure. - You may bring along some friends. - OK. - Bye. - Bye. Are you going to the hostel right away? Why? What's the matter? There's an association meeting at four o'clock. Are you coming? Is there anything special? It's important. It's about the students' protest march. You should definitely come. Tell the others as well. OK, I'll come as soon as I finish work. At four o'clock...definitely come. OK. Friends, there's a special reason for calling this meeting today. We gathered here today in order to support the worldwide freedom struggles and fights against atrocities. And now the time has come... It has been reported that in an foreign country a revolutionary youth fighting against injustice and exploitation has died in prison. This is neither the first time nor the last. Outside the prison gate there was his crying mother. But she was not the only one, there are countless mothers like her. This path to freedom? This struggle for freedom? We don't know how many dead bodies lie on this path. This entire path is covered with dead bodies. In this freedom struggle we, the students, also play an important role. We've been fighting the struggles for our rights since early on and we'll keep fighting. We will raise our voices against the atrocities all around the world. And to bring an end to it by using our way, we'll organize a peace march. Friends, this march will prove that we are not autocratic. Neither are we aimless nor irresponsible. We certainly don't have to stand for that. We're far beyond shallowness. Our organization is dedicated to all real struggles. Our struggle is not only the struggle of daily survival, but suffrage against the satanic and fascist powers rising all over the world, on whose behest atrocities are being committed everywhere. So, we've decided to form a committee regarding the peace march which will consist of representatives from colleges and in this regard, cooperation is being expected from all of you. Oh!... Come in... You've come after many days. Hello. Come here, have a seat. You have been awaited a long time. Say Hello to Ravi, uncle. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? You're coming after many days. Well, I was a bit busy. OK, wait for a minute. I'm coming. - Is this your album? - Yes. - How many stamps are there? - 200. I've got one more album. Very good! - In which grade do you study? - The seventh - A. A letter from your father arrived, regarding your sister's engagement. Yes, I also received it. Hello. How are you? You came after a long time. Is everything well at home? Yes, a letter has just arrived. OK, so what to do about it? You tell me. I've come for that very reason. The boy's family resides nearby. Let's go and meet them. You'll also meet the boy. Umm?now? What's the problem? Let's go...let's finish the task. Your father is also very worried. He hasn't received any letter from you. I had written one, maybe it has been received by now. You have tea, meanwhile I'll get ready. - Let's go and meet them. - OK. One task will be done with... - How's your younger brother? - He's fine. - You've become very lean. - Not that much. The past days there was some more work to do. OK, remain seated, I'll get the tea. This is my second album. Oh! - Is Sir at home? - Yes, come in. Have a seat. - Hello. - Hello Sir. - How are you? - Fine. This is Mr. Swaroop's son, Ravi... He's doing research work here at the university. Nice to see you. Please sit down. He came to me, I proposed to go and meet you. This was a very nice idea. Nice meeting you. I received a letter from his father. You must also have received one. Yes, it arrived last week. He wants to fix the engagement a bit sooner. This is a great pleasure. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. He's Ravi, Mr. Swaroop's son. Have a seat. - Sit down comfortably. - I'm fine. Our son has just gone out. Otherwise he could have met you. It doesn't matter. We'll come again. At which bank does your sister work? State bank, for about four years. That's very nice. What's the difference between boys and girls these days? - What's there to do at home? - Yes. I'll get tea. - You're unnecessarily troubling yourself. - Not at all. Not at all, what trouble in this? Father has sent some photographs. I've written to your father. His reply must be coming soon. He had sent the horoscope, seeing whether it matches. Thank you. - Give it to him. - You may have it. Ravi's a brilliant student you know... He has passed his M.A. degree with top grades. And now he's doing research in history. In 3-4 years his doctorate will be over. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Going home? - Yes. How's your brother? Better than before. He needs a few days rest. It must be very troublesome, everyone at home must be worried. Yes, everyone was very afraid. Our parents were far too nervous. What was the matter? What happened? No idea, he got fever at first, then started talking nonsense. I haven't seen you for ages. I wondered what might have happened. I thought of inquiring at home. No, there was nothing serious. Still a lot of lectures were missed. So, how are things with you? How about your thesis? It's going well. I started working on the second chapter. Oh, nice... OK, I leave for now...bye bye. Ravi, this is Nalini... ...she came from Nellore, with her manuscript. She's working on the rule of the French in the Nizam's territories. She's done very good work. If you've got time you should definitely read it. Ravi's working on the Portuguese and the Indian trade in the 17th century. I suggested the topic and Ravi liked it. You must have read my recent article on this topic. Not many have agreed with that. Regarding the previous article as well, there were the same reactions. Those agreeing with Pearson and Boxer? put emphasis on the influence of the Church. Ravi, show her mine and Desouza's article. May be she'll get something useful out of it. Sir, I've brought this chapter. Good...I'll look into it... And how's work progressing? It's going fine. Next week I'm going to Calcutta? for a seminar and a lecture tour after that. - I'll look into your chapter as soon as I return. - Fine. OK Sir, I take your leave. OK Ravi, I'm sorry about this chapter. No, it's OK... Have a good trip Sir. Come to me if there's any work. I'll be coming to the university in two-three days. Thank you Sir. Tea...two... Did any letter from home arrive? Yes, 10-15 days ago. How are things? Is everything OK? Yes, all is fine. There are talks regarding sister's engagement. The boy just stays here. Have you seen the boy? I went there once, but he was not at home. It's a nice family. Have things been confirmed? It's in the process. They've written father regarding the dowry. Is that so? What has been written? Don't know much about it. Father wrote that they are demanding too much. It's strange. What are they demanding? I don't know. You go and talk to them once. There's no harm in talking! What shall I talk about? I will think about it after father's reply arrives. Still what's the problem in meeting? Yes, I'll go one day. - Hello Ravi. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. Come... Mummy this is my friend Ravi. - Hello. - Hello. He's doing research at the history department. Is that so? Have a seat! Just a minute, I'll be there soon. I passed by here I thought about seeing you. Had you been out? No, I was here... Just been nearby... How about the studies? I've missed so many lectures. I'm trying to catch up. - How's your work? - Fine. The professor has gone out these days? that's why it's a bit slack. But it's still making progress. I'll bring some tea. - Won't it be a problem? - No problem, I'll just get it. Mama... Thank you. - Is sugar OK? - Yes, it's OK. Have a biscuit. Come in for a minute. Excuse me. - Did I disturb you? - No, what disturbance? I've to go out with mum... ...after a while...there's no hurry. You remain seated, I'll soon be back. - Hello, Ravi. - Hello. I was just looking for you. Is that so? Was there any work? No, just because. I haven't seen you for ages. Were you someplace else? No, I was just here. I didn't come to the university for some days. Just a minute. Prabha... Sorry. Is your thesis finished? Yes, nearly? All that remains is typing the last chapter. Have you eaten? No, not yet? I was thinking about it. - Where will you eat? - I haven't decided yet. I'm bored with eating at the canteen. Let's go somewhere else. Is there anything special? Not so. OK let's go...where to eat? Anywhere, it's just 12 o'clock now. Shall we go? Doesn't matter, I'm feeling a little hungry. How are you feeling? The work is over... I'm feeling good. My parents are very happy. Okay. It's been five years... They were quite worried because of me. They wanted me to abandon the research midway and take up some job. But I objected. What could I have done? Somehow I finished the thesis. What are your plans for the future? I haven't thought about it yet. What will you eat? Anything. Still...have a look. Chicken... anything with chicken. Roast chicken?mutton chops and salad. - Thumbs up? - Yes. Two thumbs up. Do you have a matchbox? Seen any film? No, I didn't find the time. Anyway, I see few films. One day I saw you? ...near 'Regal'... ?in some morning show? ?.some Bengali film was being screened. Yes, Ghosh got some tickets. Just by force. I saw an old movie, 'Daan' (The Offering)... ...I was tired of working, so went along with it. I liked it very much. The songs are very nice. I like Talat Mahmood? Such a fine voice. Just listening to it sometimes makes me cry. Hello. Hey...come have a seat. When did you come? I just arrived a little while ago. - Let's go to the room. - No... it's fine here. Just a minute, I'll order a tea. Let it be, no need of it. - It'll just take a minute. - Leave it be, it's fine. - How are you? - Fine. I came yesterday as well? ...you were not there. What to do regarding your sister's engagement? There's no letter from your father either, and they want to decide a bit early. Father's letter did arrive. They are asking for a dowry. The boy wants to buy a flat. They are asking for a lot of money. Then what is there to do? Father has asked if anything can be done about it. Can't some arrangements be made? Other than that the family is nice. What can I do? By the way this is also not good. Then what to do? What can be done? You tell them that you don't know anything about it... Father will write to them. Fine. Let's start, brothers. Friends! One of our foreign students has received a letter saying that he has to leave the country within 24 hours. And for him it's the invitation to death. In his country under the pretext of politics, cruel murders are being committed. Our student comrade is absolutely innocent. He has just raised his voice against the atrocities going on in his country. Thousands of students are being imprisoned in his country. And him being a citizen with self-esteem, this friend of ours has raised his voice. For this, can we let him walk into the clutches of death? Being a self-respecting citizen, a conscious citizen and a student? we should help him, going along with his struggle. We will not let him leave the country. Soon we will give a memorandum to the VC, so that on our behalf, he urge to our country's leaders to give asylum to our fellow student in our country. Within half an hour we will prepare our memorandum and submit it to the VC and proclaim that if our fellow student should be extradited by the country, then we will agitate. All the students present on campus are requested to assemble in front of the VC ?s office within half an hour. This is not only for him but for us as well, a matter of life and death. LONG LIVE THE STUDENTS' SOLIDARITY! LONG LIVE! LONG LIVE! DEMOCRACY IS IN DANGER! ALL STUDENTS SHALL BE UNITED! BE UNITED! BE UNITED! DOWN WITH FASCISM! DOWN! DOWN! YELL STUDENTS! ATTACK! YELL ALOUD! ATTACK! ATTACK FASCISM! WITH DEFIANCE! ATTACK! ALL TOGETHER! ATTACK! THE GOAL IS IN FRONT! ATTACK! WE'LL FACE BATONS & BULLETS! STILL WE'LL MARCH ON! Careful! Be careful! I'm being careful! It's all right....you stumbled... Are you OK? I'm all right, who are you to ask me anything? Why get angry? I didn't say anything wrong! - Getting angry for no reason! - Shut up! Who are you? Who are you to judge me to be careful? But what's the matter? I haven't said anything wrong! - Shouting for no reason! - Who are you to tell me anything? - I'll do whatever I feel. - It's OK! Why are you shouting? Talk politely. Cut the crap, I know what to do. - No need to teach manners. - Leave it be! - Why is he telling me again and again? - What's the use of fighting? Leave it be...just ignore it... ...keep quite...easy... But I never told him anything. Make him sit down pal? Sit down, pal?Sit down pal... I never told him anything... Ravi... I'm not feeling well. I'm not feeling well. What happened? Feeling nauseous? Don't know.... I'm feeling weird. Take me to a doctor. Nothing's happened to you. Let's go to the hostel. No, I'm not going to the hostel... Take me to a doctor... I'm not well. What's the matter? Is there any problem? Taxi! How are you feeling now? I'm fine... You go ahead. I'll soon be there.
