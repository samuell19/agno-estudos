[Bubbling] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Everything changes. It's a fact. Everything is destined to undergo a change. We live to take care of our children, to protect them, to make sure that they're well. We live every day with the fear that unexpected events can change our life. But time, it doesn't stop. It doesn't wait. You can't control it. It's life, a breath, a moment. [MUSIC PLAYING] Laura? We better head down. It's almost dark. Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. I'm heading down with the guys. Call me when you're on the road. I'll call you when I'm back at the lab, Adam. Oh, leave everything in the car. Next week, when we get back, we need to update and analyze all the data we need to send. Get some rest over the next seven days. We deserve it, right? I'm not coming back. Everything's in my notes. Your tour is over? Time flies. I'll call you. Be careful. My name is Laura... Laura Winslet. I'm a geologist. I study the seismic activity of volcanoes. When I was a kid, while I was at school on a day just like any other, an earthquake rocked our desks. We looked at each other, terrified. Something totally unexpected had happened from one moment to another. Volcanoes, the Earth, time... life is just one of those things that you just can't predict. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Are you still there? Adam, I'm almost home. What do you want, to hear my dogs barking or something? I just need to park and I'm there. All right. I'm taking my son to the falls tomorrow. And if you can get in touch with me or if you need anything, just leave me a message. OK. Listen, you want to... go... jeez. Mommy, when are you coming? Grandpa says you're never coming. Yeah, you've got to be here, mommy. Time for a party. Press off. Shit. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] The worst never ends. I've heard it said again and again, but it's a lie. There is an end. And it starts when you hit the bottom. I had just fallen. If you're so sure that I'm not going to die because I'm the one telling you this story, that's a pretty big assumption. We'll anticipate what will happen next. I had been working there for 30 days. I was sure of where I was going. Nothing could surprise me. But now I'm here. I'd made the same mistake again. I'm sure about tomorrow, but now what have you fallen into? Nothing but darkness. [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] I know what you're thinking... scream, look for help, do something. I could yell, cry, get all worked up... for what? I just fell in here a few minutes ago, but I am already certain that there's no way out. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] As with all true beginnings, everything starts with you trying to reach something. I already know what I won't find in that backpack... no ladder, no rope, nothing that I can use to pull myself out of here. [PANTING] A half a liter of water, a pack of gum, nothing to eat. The others will be back in a week... seven days and eight nights. I skipped lunch today, damn it. What kind of shitty situation did I get myself into? [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Mommy, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. [PANTING] Mommy, wake up. Oh, oh, hi. Mommy, you remember what day is today. It is your birthday. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Oh... Uh-huh. It's at our house. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] That's lovely, fantastic. Adam called a few times. I want you to call him back. You're going up to the volcano, too? Yeah, I just... I have to get some more soil samples. I understand, I understand. Hey, that's a beautiful palm tree. And all the flowers outside the house... that's beautiful. You're so clever. I want to color some in. Lovely windows... Just step up here. You don't... you can put my hand right there. All right. Here we go. OK. OK. Are you sure you want to wait until later to open it with me? Yes. Don't be late for the party. I won't be... can't, I promise. I'm disappointed, Laura. That's enough, Dad. If you can't get through on my phone, just send me voice messages. OK, be careful. We'll going to have a party. Yay! Yay! Laura, about last night. You don't have to say anything. You were drinking. You weren't yourself. I know I had a couple of drinks, but everything I said is true. I feel the same. Adam, you're my best friend. We work together. What happened between us doesn't change anything. We're just friends. You know it's more than that. I mean, whatever we do, I feel good. I want to leave Emily. I don't love her anymore. And... Mommy, when are you? Grandpa says you're coming. Yeah, you're got to be here, mommy. Time for a party. Press off. Sweetheart, I'll be home soon. [MUSIC PLAYING] Have you ever dreamed your memories? I do it all the time. It's amazing how real they seem, but I'm still here in this shit hole. Mommy, when are you coming? Grandpa says you're coming. Yeah, you're got to be here, mommy. Time for a party. Press off. I told you a lie, Christine. [MUSIC PLAYING] I get it. It doesn't seem that solid, but it's the best idea I could think up. [PANTING] Yes, yes, yes... no, no, no. On to my phone, holding the rope... help me! [CRYING] Fuck. Shit. [SCREAMING] Help! Snakes. [SOBBING] Dad, I don't remember what I said the last time I saw you. Sometimes we don't recognize the really important moments. They slip away without knowing we won't have another opportunity to go back and say, I'm sorry, I love you, and thanks. When I was a little girl, you always found an answer to all my questions... or at least I thought you did. You probably didn't, but I couldn't understand it. I thought that as a parent, I would have an answer to everything. I'd like to think so. Now that I am a parent, I know that's not true. There are too many questions, and new ones never stop coming. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] What a way to go... I never would have guessed it. The silence, the heat, the cold at the heart of the volcano... ending my days in total agony down here. I wouldn't wish it upon anybody, but it's happening to me. It's like one of those stories you see in a film or you hear people talk about. How long can her body keep going without eating, without drinking, in conditions like this? I may end up drinking my pee soon, because my water is going to run out. Yeah, it's something I've heard of plenty of times, but I would never think of doing it. [PANTING] Hey Laura, it's me. Call me... bye. [PANTING] [CHATTER] I'm sorry I'm late, princess. OK, mommy. I'm going to go help Grandpa with the cake, OK? I want to stay with you. Oh, I know. Me too, sweetie. You know what? Why don't you go play with the others, and I'll be right back. OK, Mommy. OK. Thank you, dad. [CHATTER] Christine, Christine, come here... it's OK, it's OK. Come here, breathe. Mommy's here, OK? Breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mommy, finish... I'm better now, Mommy, all better. You are better. Every night, you and mommy are going to do these exercises so we can get better together. OK? Mommy, we never opened the gift. Oh, you're right, honey. Let's open it. Who is this? What's her name? She is a geologist, just like mommy, and her name is Clarissa. Clarissa. Yeah. She goes to study the soil. And she comes right back home, because she knows her daughter is waiting for her. [PANTING] [HISSING] [MUSIC PLAYING] It's all right. It's like Christine. Mommy's not like Clarissa. Mommy's always late. Why can't... your mommy's not a good mother. Oh, god... help! Help me! Help! Is anybody there! Help me out. I'm down here! [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. Breathe... one, two, three, breathe. One... [PANTING] It's not the heat. It's not the hunger. It's the silence. The silence is destroying my eardrums, my mind. The black rocks all around me, all of my screams, all of my pleas for help are sucked up. And I'm stuck here alone, and nobody will ever find me. Nobody will ever know what's happening to me. They'll think I ran off because of my life. Adam didn't get the message. No one will find me. I have to get myself out of here, but how? Laura? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PANTING] [HISSING] Sorry, pal. You're right. I'm the one that barged into your house, but I didn't mean to. And if you come close again, I'll have to kill you. It's just a question of survival. It's nothing personal. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING] [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I'm sorry. You caught me at a bad time, man. What is it? They're checking the areas. It's been three days without any news. I won't go there. I'm sorry, but I won't. [MUSIC PLAYING] Think of something, Laura. Think. Look at us. We put work before everything, and now what? Now, we're all alone. I know. I'm a lousy mother. What's the point in going on? Maybe being down here is the best thing that could happen. You're right. I should probably just let go. Give up hope. Do it, Laura. Do it. A demon seen... no. Just my lack of a will to live telling me what to do. That can be sweet... another way of solving all your problems. Is that what you want, Laura? Do you really want to throw in the towel and die? OK, ready? We can do it again. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so... [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] Good morning. Good morning. I'm Nick Winslet, her father. When news is there? Hey, bud. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Unfortunately, no. We are doing everything we can, but that area is very large. How long can she survive? [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] We're putting all efforts in the search. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where are you, Laura? [MUSIC PLAYING] Where... where are you? [MUSIC PLAYING] My leg doesn't hurt as bad. I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm hungry. I'm trying not to drink, but I'm so thirsty. I have two swallows of water left, and then that's it. [MUSIC PLAYING] I feel so weak. I can't make it. I just can't. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] Am I really managing to climb out? I'm going to fall and really hurt myself this time. I have no strength left. I've never been able to get where I want to go, but now I want to get to that damn backpack so I can rest up there, catch my breath, and try and keep climbing. [PANTING] [SOBBING] Laura, can you hear me? Help! My leg is broken, I can't move. Just relax, I'll pull you out. It hurts like hell. [SOBBING] If you hadn't shown up, I'd have died down there. You saved my life. You held out for four days. You would have made it out of there without me. You're wrong. I would have died down there if it weren't for you. You figured as much, right? It's too easy to dream that someone stretches out their hand to you and pulls you out of trouble. It'd be too sweet... too easy to fix everything like that. This time, I really have to drag myself out of this mess on my own. I don't want to let you down, Christine, but Mommy is really tired. I know I disappointed you, and that you're sure Mommy can get out of here without any problems... just like your Clarissa. But I don't have any strength left, my love. I just can't make it out of this hole. It's swallowed me up... doesn't want to let me go. Dad... Dad, listen, I want to tell you something. Oh, Christine. It's Mommy. Just so you know, I won't be late. I'm on my way. Christine, Christine, Christine... Talking down here, saying my daughter's name... it helps me feel better. It makes me feel at peace. Dad, Christine... naming the people you love most in life can bring you relief, it's true. In this place, there's a choked echo. For a split second, I can hear my voice bounce back to me, just as if it were speaking to me. I'm not alone. Laura... With myself. Laura, come on. Laura, get up. Get up. Christine's waiting for you. [PANTING] You won't disappoint her again. [PANTING]| [SCREAMING] [PANTING] OK. [SOBBING] Now what? Now you're there, halfway between the bottom and the exit. Nobody's going to pull you out. You have no idea how to do it yourself. I can try to balance myself, shimmy out. My legs won't hold. If I fall this time, the risk of cracking my skull and bleeding to death is almost a sure thing. My friend down there would be happy. He'd have food to eat for weeks. [PANTING] The sun is covered. Don't faint, Laura. Don't faint, or you won't make it back up again. I'm exhausted. Being up here makes me feel safer, but I have no strength left. I'm far away from that snake, which might be harmless anyway, but I've never been crazy about snakes. [PANTING] [COUGHING] I have to drink. Adam, you're a good man, and Emily deserves your love. It's clear we have something special between us, I just... I don't want to ruin that. If you're still in love with Eric, I'll stop insisting. I don't know what else to say. Adam, we're just friends. That's all I need. OK, whatever you want. This is how Laura Winslet comes to an end and makes her exit. Adam, he's a good man, he makes me feel good. But he's married. He's my friend. Friendship isn't love, right, Laura? Why am I thinking about him now? They say that before you die, you think of the people that are most important to you, the ones you'll miss the most. He's one of them. [PANTING] I have to get down from here. What time is it? [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] No... no news yet. OK, Adam. So we'll talk tomorrow? I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Laura! [COUGHING] I will find you, Laura. I will find you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Dad? I've been calling you nonstop. Why don't you answer? [SOBBING] I'm not going anywhere. [SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Perhaps dying in this hole is a way to end the suffering, a predictable way to end it all. But something inside me says that this can't be the last chapter. Something tells me that I have to keep on living. Not for my daughter... she's gone. Not for my father, not for Adam, for myself. I have to do it for myself. , Mommy when are coming? Grandpa says that you're coming. Nobody's going to pull me out of here. Only I can do it, if I really want to do it. Only I can find the strength inside me to fight back. I have to live... I want to live. [MUSIC PLAYING] Healing from a wound that does not want to heal takes time. Healing can be slow, very slow. Months can pass, sometimes even years. But in the end, even after the deepest darkness, the sun always rises again. And I start to breathe again, aware that something has changed in me... completely, forever.
