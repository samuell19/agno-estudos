They're taking too long to get in there. Radio them now (walkie talkie crackles) [Woman] Team Six, we have you on the scanner. You need to move fast! [Man] We're running outta time. They need to take the pills before they enter the graveyard. (foreboding orchestral music) [Narrator] Medieval central Spain was home to one of the largest bubonic plagues to ever hit Europe: the Black Death. Although the last infected victim was buried in 1356, it has been said that he was buried alive, and some have said his screams can still be heard throughout this one secret graveyard. Recent reports claim that locals have gone into the forest as if they were in a trance, following the screams, and have not returned. A secret society has assembled a black ops team of mercenaries, known as Project Legion, to secure the area in order to conduct research in hopes to find the missing persons. Although experimental, the medication prescribed should limit their symptoms after exposure. (eerie atmospheric music) (soldier spits) (soldier spits) (walkie talkie crackles) Copy HQ.

(static crackling) All right, boys. We're in a dead zone. Any and all communications are gone. I don't understand... why they can't just... get satellite images. It's strange. It's not your job to understand. All right, boys. Pills. Let's spark these flares and get going. (flare sparks) Y'all ready? Ready. Let's move on. (suspenseful instrumental music) (ash rattling) What the heck? It's like we're walking through a giant campfire pit. There's like three feet of ash down here. Ash or not, orders to get the center of this thing. Over there. Solids ground. That was fun. What now, Greg? I don't know, bud. Our job is to clear this area so they can bring the research team in. Any idea why? [Soldier] Orders. (otherworldly shrieking) Shit. What was that? I thought when I booked this gig I was gonna see a bull fight, find me a sexy senorita. The hell with this! The money ain't worth shit! All right. Keep it together, soldier. The history of this place. 666 years later, on this exact date? The locals called this place the ash dobbles. Dobbles! There has to be an explanation for this. Find that bell. Find that bell! (otherworldly shrieking) (man screaming) Hey. Hey, on me! Hey! On me!

Those are definitely a conversation piece. Yeah. I did kiss you that first night. You dick. Can I talk to you? I want to take you dinner tonight. But I have to work tonight. My guy, can I help you something? (men grunting) (intense orchestral music) (bottle shatters) (shot glasses clink) Stay away from Cindy. (men grunting) (intense rock music) Ah, you want some more do you? (switchblade clicks) (men grunting) (man shouts) (chair shatters) Hey. Good work. Where were you on that one? You had it. Four shots of fireball. We're not kissing right now. There's always tomorrow. I have these ready for you. Doctor's orders. (dizzying instrumental music) Isn't that your neighbor? Yeah (shot glass clinks) (intense rock music on stereo) (tires squeal) (Greg groans) Hey, Georgie! My man! Keep walking. Georgie, have you ever been in love? Sick of cleaning your mess. (ominous atmospheric music) (key clinking) (unsettling atmospheric music) How are you feeling? Don't know. It'll come back to you.

This is not right. (Greg muttering) Was it Karen? Karen never would. Cindy? I wish. (muttering) (distant booming) (troubling instrumental music) (punches laptop) (troubling instrumental music) Please work. Please work. (dial tone beeping) [Woman] I'm sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please- Work. (dial tone beeping) (Greg groans) [Woman] I'm sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please text the number- (phone slams) [Debbie] Hello, you've reached Bill and Debbie. Thank you for calling. We're sorry we're unable to get to the phone right now. We're currently vacationing in the Bahamas. (indistinct) But Bill and I are doing great, enjoying retirement and seeing the world. Please leave us your name, number, and a detailed message. We'll be sure to get back with you as soon as we can. Have a blessed day. Goodbye. (siren wailing) (somber instrumental music) Hey. Hello. Mom, Dad. Don't be a pussy. Fuckin' dad.

(creature snarling) Karen? (loud bang) You should go back in your room. Go back in your room. Back in your room. Karen! I haven't seen you since the bar. Everything all right? Karen, this has gone too far. (unsettling atmospheric music) Karen, are you okay? What happened? Greg, go! [Greg] Karen. Greg, go! (sobbing) Karen, are you okay? Greg, go! Leave! Go! Leave! Go! Go!

Pills. Pills, pills. (gentle piano music) What? (siren wailing) (somber string music) (hammering) (tape stretching) (creature snarling) What is happening? What is... (clattering) (tense drum music) (Greg groans) (creature cackling) Laugh all you want, you're not getting in here! (creature cackling) (Greg laughing) Keep laughing! (Greg laughs) (creature laughs) (disturbing orchestral music) (creature snarling) (light bulb clicking) (Greg clears throat) Hello? To whoever this... To whoever sees this, my name is is Greg Rourke. This video message is for whoever finds this. Something... (clears throat) Something is happening, and I don't know... I don't know, I don't know, I don't... I don't know what. I don't know what. There are things in the hallway. There was one in my room, and it got out of my window before I knew anything. They're definitely... They're definitely not human. (sirens wailing) I barricaded myself in my apartment, and I'm safer. I think I'm safer now. The cell phones don't work. My TV is out. The power is gone, but the power is flickering. I hear noises in the hallway. Screaming and... And laughing! And laughing. I'm not crazy. This... I woke up this morning and the world has gone to hell. If you're seeing this, I hope it's not too late, but please send help, or help yourself. (creature snarling) Hello? Karen? Episode... This is my first video. I will try to leave more. Karen! (stand clattering) Karen! Not Karen. (eerie atmospheric music) What do you mean not K... What do you mean you're not Karen? You're my neighbor. Karen? Yeah, you are, Karen. We're buds. Are we? We've barely spoke. What are... What are you? (giggles) The darkness. (disturbing orchestral music) Are you alive? (giggles) What do you want? You. Karen, you're too young. We tried this, and there's Cindy. And then there's Cindy. (Greg muttering) You're too young, and I have Cindy. We just want you. You're one of the lucky ones. Lucky? Lucky ones? Karen... No. No, I'm not. I'm not a lucky one, Karen. This is... You're still human. Where am I, Karen? Where are my friends? They're happy. (body squelching) Many didn't realize it at the time, but they're happy. Happy? No. No, no, no, no. This isn't happy. Hey... Are you dad? Greg, just come out and say hi. Don't make this harder than it has to be. (tense string music) [Greg] This is a dream. I can come in. And I can help you figure that out. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. (couch sliding) Karen, if you come in here... I'll kill you! (smacks head) I'll kill you, Karen! We can live. We enjoy you. Who's we? We who? We? Legion. Darkness (banging on door) 213. You can't keep us out forever. Ha. Try me. Karen. Hello, this is... this is Greg Rourke. This is my second video. I'm under the conclusion that... whatever's happening is something... something I can't explain, something... (creature chittering) Something I don't know. It's definitely not a terrorist attack. Some kind of earthquake. It's something far, far worse. Creatures. There are creatures. And the creature, they take the form of people. People that I know. Karen. They changed Karen. (somber atmospheric music) (siren wailing) Is the water? This is not water. I don't... I don't know if something has caused this or something set loose. Something we've never experienced. It's almost like it's... like it's evil. (creature snarling) I'm not crazy. This... This is real. Can you hear it? I can... Can you hear them? I can hear... You're not... I hear you! (Greg muttering) [Karen] Greg. Keep scratching. Keep... [Karen] After all we've been through? Why treat you this way? You're not real. Greg, I can come in, and we can have a talk as adults. I promise. I do really wanna hurt you. (creature snarls) You can't stay in there forever. Yeah. (case clatters) I'm gonna die alone. Where's, the gun, where's the gun, where's the gun? Car. Gun's in the car. Put gas in the car. Did you put gas in the car? And soon you'll be outta here. Gotta get in the garage. (dramatic orchestral music) (creature snarling) (banging on door) (door banging) (Greg groaning) (Greg panting) (siren wailing) You're not dying. Get outta here. Let's get outta here. (anxious atmospheric music) All right, we gotta make it to the car. Make it to the freeway. Gas. Gas, gas, gas, gas. Get the hell outta here. Get outta here. (suspenseful orchestral music) Go! (disturbing orchestral music) (creature snarling) (water dripping) Georgie? (car alarm blaring) (intense percussive music) (engine puttering) (hood slams) (creature roars) (Greg grunting) (car alarm blaring) (creature snarls) (Greg shouts) (kick slams) (Greg grunting) (creature snarling) (Karen roars) Karen. (Greg shouts) (Karen roars) (pounding on door) What's going on? This is Greg. This is my third video. I hear sirens and helicopters. Society seems like it's still... still intact. I have enough food for maybe one and a half, two days tops. I just tried to get down to my car, get my weapon. Nothing. Power doesn't work. Power's out. Phone doesn't work. They're weak. They're not as strong as I, as you, think. It's definitely, definitely real, definitely real. (creature snarling) Karen, no! You're not getting... Karen's turned, and she's in the hallway. In the hallway, in the hallway. And I gotta get Cindy, and I gotta... I gotta... This is real, everybody. Things are crazy, going on. I gotta get... (pounding on door) Trying. You don't wanna come in. Y'all don't wanna come in here. I think I figure out how to beat him. If anybody's watching, in the hall I was talking to a bunch of dead people. If you're watching this... send help, find help. They want your organs. That's what they want, organs. I've been smoking, I've been drinking, and I've got gall stones, so, ha ha ha! Ha, joke's on you, Karen! This is real. This is real. (creature snarling) I need to figure out how to get outta here. I can only hunker down a little bit longer. And I gotta get to Detroit. I gotta get Cindy. I gotta get Cindy, get to Detroit, see my mom. And... power's still down. I'll try my other TV. If you're watching this, send help. And if you're bunch of dead people, it's too late. Come on. (helicopter whirring) (TV static crackling) [Reporter] We are reporting live from the WRX studios, where hell has been released onto the city. The end of the human race is here. We are doomed. I urge every one of you to stay inside. Yeah, I'm inside, I'm inside. Come on, come on, come on. [Reporter] And whatever the hell this is, they are watching you, so stay inside! Pray that we can get through this together. Please pray. And... Hold on. Just a second. I just got word from boots on the ground that they are setting fire to City Hall. And just earlier today, they invaded Stevenson High School off of 57th and Maine. These are our kids we're talking about! Our future! Jesus fuck! Is anyone listening? - Me. Me. - We are doomed! - I am. - We're fucked! We're screwed! Who's out there? Is there anyone out there? [Greg] Me! I am! [Reporter] The whole world's going to shit! Dear God! No! (indistinct shouting) I wish. [Reporter] Oh my God! They're starting to come through the doors! They're everywhere! But that's all the time we have for today, folks. Goodnight. Be well. (gun fires) (intense instrumental music) (creature snarling) (pounding on door) Took you long enough (Greg grunting) (bookshelf clatters) (mirror shatters) (TV shatters) (pounding on door) (Greg grunting) (siren wailing) (disturbing instrumental music) (creature snarling) (Greg whispers) (tape stretching) (hammering) (hammering) (slams hat) Let's go! (siren wailing) (knocking on door) Hey, Greg. it's Mills? Mills? Mills! Yeah, buddy, it's me. Wills, is that you? Yeah. Doesn't it sound like me? Are you okay? Dude, it's crazy. Something happened. I'm not sure, man. The devil is infecting people. The devil, nah. It's... It's not. Yeah, it's nuts out here. Even the army's in town. Army? Army's here? [Mills] Yeah. I have no cell phone. The TV's down. The power's out. I have no idea what's going on. Yeah, all the communication was all shut down. I was with Cindy when it happened. Cindy? You're with Cindy? She's downstairs. She's okay. [Greg] Hey, man, why are you with Cindy? Don't worry about it. Why are you, Mills? You're supposed to be my friend. Why are you trying to sleep with my girl? Are you serious, bro? [Greg] Are you being serious, bro? Bro, I don't know if you've got a chance to look outside, but everything is fucked up, man. [Greg] Yeah. My whole apartment is barricaded. I know things are seriously screwed up right now. Where's Cindy. Let me see her. Is she okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, and... Cindy is safe. [Greg] How did you get here? How did you get here, Mills? We were gonna take a cab when it all went down. We ended up walking. [Greg] It's seven miles from Carnage. There's no power. There's no lights. How did you see through the dark? And how did you get on my balcony? Dude, what does it even matter? We're here now, and that's what counts. And those things, those creatures... they're everywhere, but you just gotta kick 'em in the head and they leave you alone. [Greg] No. You kick 'em. I just fought one down at... No, no, no. You're weak. You're a little scrawny, weak... You don't just... You don't just kick 'em, Mills. Something's not right here, buddy. Dude, what's your issue? [Greg] No. You. You're always with Cindy. You're my issue, Mills! You. You! You're trying to take my girl. Now you're on my balcony. I don't know how. You're crazy! [Greg] I'm not crazy. Don't call me crazy. Don't call me crazy. I'm not crazy. This isn't... This is real. (siren wailing) Just shut up and let me in. [Greg] No, Mills. I'm not letting you in. I don't know how you got here in the dark. 20/20 vision. [Greg] Ha ha! No, Mills. You don't have 20/20 vision. Oh. Glasses. Right. (Mills laughing) Should have thought of that. (Mills laughing) Busted. [Greg] What... What do you mean you're... busted? (dramatic instrumental music) [Creature] Open the door. Where is Cindy? Mills, if you... If I open that door... I'm beatin' your ass. Then let us in. Open. It will come in! (creature snarling) (pounding on door) Come on. I'm ready. [Mills] Okay. Bad move, buddy. Bad move. I'll see you, too, Mills. (uneasy instrumental music) (creature pants) (Greg sighs) (somber instrumental music) What's going on? This is Greg. I don't know if you guys know the world has gone crazy. Mills is out there. He's not my friend anymore. Something else. Something changes them. And Cindy... I don't know where you are. Okay. Remember that time we were on that dinner date? We were trying to track down that restaurant, Nelson's. Or was it... La Bouche? Milkshakes. You... We ordered three milkshakes. I had two. You had a strawberry. There's so much... I wish I could have said to you. So much I wanted to say. Right. Those fries. (muttering) We got two fries. You ate both of 'em. You mixed it up and made a special sauce. (laughs) This... This whole thing really interfered with that. Could sure use you here now. I guess I messed up. (eerie atmospheric music) (bones cracking) (creature snarls) (nails scratching window) Mills, go away. Lots of food out here. How much Mills is in you? Huh? I said, how much of my friend Mills is in you? Do you really want to know? Yeah, man. What happened to you? Dead. Dead is better. Man, we all used to be friends. Who said we were friends? The apple doesn't fall far from its tree. (Mills cackling) Where's Cindy? Cindy is fine where she is. Be a devil and let us in. I'm not you. Huh? (indistinct speech) (intense instrumental music) (creatures snarling) (pounding on door) (swelling string music) Stupid Mills is out there. Gotta get to Carnage. Gotta get my girl. Come on, get us outta here. Gotta get outta here. Think, think, think, think. It's got to be a dream. (dramatic instrumental music) This could be real. Could be a dream. Hey, Mills... Mills? You still out there, buddy? Oh, Mills... I'm coming for you. (creatures snarling) (banging on door) This might be in my head. Might be a dream. I don't care. I'm going. I'm going. Gotta get... Gotta get Cindy. I gotta outta here. (pounding on door) [Mills] Greg, can't you see? We're the same. We are nothing, nothing alike, Mills. You're weak! I'm strong! This might be a nightmare. I'll tell you what. Somebody's nightmare is my dream come true, brother! So you better fuckin' run! I'm coming for you! I'm gonna get my girl, and I'm outta here! [Mills] Come on. What happened to my friend Greg? Greg's gone, Mills. You are not gonna like the guy that I become. You've pushed me to this, Mills. So I'm giving you a chance to leave now before I come out there and kick your ass your all the way to Carnage, get Cindy, and get outta here. [Mills] Better get ready, Greg. 'Cause we're coming for you. (cackling) Okay. This is Greg. This will be my last video. It's been a while. I am hungry, and I'm tired, and I'm going back to Detroit. I am leaving all of this... (laughs) To whoever's still alive or related to me, except for the goldfish. I'm bringing the goldfish home with me. You know, should've never left Detroit. I think living in mom's basement doesn't seem... doesn't seem that bad anymore. Home cooking. Hookah's down there, fresh hummus, baba ghanoush. Man, that sounds good right now. Cindy, you're gonna love baba ghanoush. You're gonna love it. You're gonna love baba ghanoush. And... Listen, Mom... and Dad... really Mom... I love you guys. I'm so excited for you to meet Cindy. So... See you soon. (gentle orchestral music) [Mills] Are you coming out? Yeah, I'm coming out. Can't wait. Are you ready? [Mills] I'm ready. Come and join us. Mills, before I come out, can you just... Can you just be real with me, man? What what's going on? [Mills] Do you really want to know? Yeah. Yeah, I really want to know Every so often, the universe decides it doesn't need certain things, and it disposes of them. You mean me? [Mills] Yes, you. Humans. All of you, you're not needed and the universe decided for you. And do you want to know what else? What? [Mills] I can choose for you. Evil always wins. And you don't have a choice now. Just join us. No, Mills. Not me, buddy. I'm coming, I'm getting Cindy, and we're getting outta here. You... You're weak. You might choose hell. I don't. I choose life. [Mills] That's unfortunate. Times running out for you, Greg. Now we're all coming for you. Like I told you, Mills, you can try. [Mills] Bad luck. We'll see you on the other side. And I'll see you soon. (Mills cackling) (intense instrumental music) (pounding on door) Took you long enough. Remember, the pills. She has you now. She always wins. (Greg laughs) No, Mills, I always win. (bottle shatters) (loud explosion) (creatures snarling) (siren wiling) (Greg grunting) (intense percussive music) (creatures snarling) (banging on dumpster lid) (creature snarls) Greg. What's happening? Are you okay? Why's everybody looking at me? Uh-uh. Look at me. Focus. Cindy, I've been looking for you. Look at me. Focus, Greg. Come on. Look at me. You look healthy. Look at me. I need you to sit down. Sit down. Greg, sit down. Down. We need to get outta here. How was it, 213? You're... We gotta go. (troubling instrumental music) Come on. Go. Check his vitals. [Cindy] Get him down. Fuck off me! (Greg grunting) Cindy! Cindy! (Greg sobbing) [Cindy] Greg? (Greg moans) Do you know where you're at? At my apartment. No. You're in a secret facility. You're patient 213. You've been part of an experiment. You're the only survivor. No, I live in 213. No, you're part of an experiment. We gotta go. We gotta get to... No. There is no "we". This has all been a part of your imagination. (mysterious instrumental music) [Greg] What? Greg, she's telling you the truth. It's true, 213. - No. - It's okay. No. He's starting to turn. Give him the pills. (intense instrumental music) Cindy! Cindy! [Man] Abort! Abort! Project Legion has failed! (Greg snarling) Project Legion has failed! (fire crackling) (Greg panting) (explosion) (grim instrumental music)
