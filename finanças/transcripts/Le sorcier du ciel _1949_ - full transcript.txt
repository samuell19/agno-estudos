HOLY FAMILY STUDIOS Classic Catholic Cinema 60th anniversary LE SORCIER DU CIEL HOLY FAMILY STUDIOS LE SORCIER DU CIEL the life of St. John Vianney A MARCEL BLISTÃˆNE FILM Whenever France falters... a watchful Providence... sets in the angry sky, A star to guide her, After the Revolution and Naopolean's wars... France was exhausted. Everywhere were excesses... Nowhere a saviour, But, one evening, in 1818... on a little country road... a humble village priest... traveled to his parish... bringing the eternal Message. Humble and lowly... rich only in his faith... so poor in his studies, he was barely ordained. . . sent to the most wretched of villages... A simple soul... a peasant... Nothing about him remarkable... Nothing... Except this strange ripple... That shadow lying in wait... there. Are you making that noise, Mme Bibost ? There's no noise. I felt we were being followed... A neighbour of mine used to hear rats - - but he was never sober... It's called a ``delirium``... Which way to Ars ? Straight ahead, M. le Cure... ...You show me the way to Ars - - I will show you the way to Heaven. You'd better be off. They are all mine - here. Did you hear that ? What ? A voice... First noises, then voices... Do you often hear voices... Never. . . It's your fasting - ruining your health. And Ars won't keep you in food. I need so little. We're not far off - now. Well - come on... What's wrong? Turn back... No. A waste of time - here... One day, this parish will become too small to house all its visitors. Because of you? Pride is a sin, you know... A good start! Nothing is holding it back... - Nothing more - now. Let's toast the newly-weds! Look! A priest! We'll give you a hand! Don't bother - I'm nearly there... Who asked him to come? Don't speak to priests ! It brings bad luck ! Curse! I'll drive him away, you wait... Please don't stop the festivity for me, my friends... We have plenty of time to meet... I'm the new Cure... What? We don't need a Cure! No holy water for us - - take my advice : return where you came... I warned you! They're heretics! ... They're not as bad as you think. Well said ! Come... drink with us... A waste of good wine ! I'm an expert, you know... There are vineyards in my village. Your health... A local wine? I've tasted better! Once I'm installed, if you allow me - I'll be glad to give you a few tips... I once worked on a farm... Like you, I'm a man of the soil. He's right ! This wine's abominable ! What ? Say that again! You don't mind drinking it, anyhow ! He pulled your leg because you didn't marry in church! Nothing of the sort! If they didn't that's their affair. They'll regret it! Did you hear that? He put a curse on us! Let the crow caw! I'll shut his trap! Welcome, M. the Cure. Forgive us bothering you... A pleasure, on the contrary... It broke my heart to see the vicarage empty... Your arrival's unexpected... Had I know, I'd have tidied the place! You shan't drink bad wine at my wedding... What do you think of this? If you're not all dead drunk, my name's not Malray! Your first impressions can hardly be good... The bedroom's above... It's far too good for me... Whose is the furniture ? The Lady of the Manor gave it to your predecessor. We'll return it... I don't need a palace... What's behind that door ? The stables. We'll store what does not belong to us in there. He looks young enough! 32... Some fools sacrifice their happiness to a myth! Why live in such a place ? Look at your parishioners ! You can't hope to stop their wickedness... They're happy as they are... They'd scorn your promises of a mythical Paradise... If you are Satan, sent from Hell to tempt me, say so... Call me any names. Hell no more exists than Heaven! Liar! The Lord died millions of years ago... Then - why torment me into forsaking Him? I'm fond of the human race... I want people to enjoy earthly life, since there's no after- life. Remember their unhappiness will also cause your own... Keep your hints to yourself and go... Whatever you shall do, I'll still follow my Lord. Does he often talk to himself? It started on our way here... All we need is a mad priest... Mad?... Watch your words... Was Joan of Arc mad? You can't compare him to her... Besides - saints usually have haloes. Your tongue wags but says nothing. What's happening, Mme Bibost? The cart's nearly empty. Where is all this to go? Leave that to me... My young parishioners, I suppose. Come... don't be afraid... I won't eat you... What's your name? What does your father do? Digs graves. Is he very busy? He says it's not too bad... Did I scare you? I did it! Such a pity to see them grow up into jailbirds! They're left to their instincts... at present... Can you reform them? Of course ! Why not ? Your predecessor gave up hope... I should know... I'm the sacristan. I'm very pleased to know you... I'm sure we'll get on together... What have they done to you ? Nothing much... Pitiful country ! Pitiful youth ! It's no use lighting a fire... I must prepare some broth. What will you eat? Nothing tonight... We'll see tomorrow... You're afraid. Thinking of leaving ? If I do penance, the Lord will have mercy. You'll kill yourself, to no avail... Atonement is never in vain... You must find a room... It's very late... Good night, Mother Bibost! It's you again, is it? You're trembling, Vianney. Why? You're afraid because you're alone... Men are bound to feel lonely... Their souls are clad in iron shells... which only Love can break open. Yes... the Love of God... No... what I call Love... Take a look... This is what you disdain... This is what you're up against !... What you want them to forget!... They've found their Heaven on earth! That's not true... shut up... If you knew that Heaven, you wouldn't want another... I want them to enter Paradise. Why waste your life encouraging people to hate you? They may hate me if they'll love God... You're young... All the more time to devote to them... Full of ardour... Which I offer to You, O Divine Master ! Did you see those young women? Stop it! You failed with St. Anthony too, go away ! Why? Nothing is better than pleasure... Don't you long for it ? I'll conquer it! Kill the evil within me ! If your God created all, He created evil ! Yes, that we may crush it ! No! to enjoy it! Jesus, O my Lord, forsake me not! By order of H.M. Louis XVIII (18) - - Mayors must take a census of all land sown with corn. Why ? A new tax. In 1790, the Republic abolished the Salt Tax - - but Kings need money ! Samson has no land ! And the Horseshoe Tax ? You put your price up and we pay it. Hear that? The new Cure ringing for Mass. I hope we're not letting him stay! He finds our wine bad! No law permits me to throw him out ! No law - So what ? Who's running this place? The Concordat of 1799 is still in force - - religious mettings may take place with police permission... We'll make new rules ! The Mayor favours the reactionaries. - he had his kids baptised... Wasn't your mother buried by a priest during the Revolution? Possibly! But I didn't lick Napolean's boots - or support Louis XVIII (18)! What do you think of the chime ? Somewhat cracked, my friend. They won't listen and won't come... Why will we have so few? In less time than it takes - to say it and without the patient noticing it - - the tooth is out... I'll tell you... the Lady of the Manor, who is very pious, will be there - - the Lassagne children, with their mother - - and a few old people... That will be six, perhaps seven... ls that all ? We'll pray for the absentees. "...by a majority vote - `` - to insist on the instant dismissal of a priest named..." What is his name ? Leave a blank... `` for having contravened police regulations " by the immoderate use of the church bells "... What next ! We'll find other motives ! 1800 years after the death of Our Saviour - - what a pitiful state this Parish of Ars is in ! Of what use the sacrifice of Calvary ? My dear friends, I ask you: - Did the Lord die for your salvation in vain? He still loves you and calls you unto Him, And you ignore Him, you wallow in sin, - and you don't know how to escape. Were it a question of money, you'd find a way out - - but as it's only your soul, you ignore it. I've decided to fight with all my might, to fight the sins of Ars - - to fight ignorance and indifference to religion - - with all the consequences... ... As the parishioners keep away from their Church - - they will at least hear me ! Where I come from, everybody is happy. Work on the land is blessed ! People respect the Law of God. What's he saying ? I will not speak of the joy of the Love of God. I'll leave that till later. You have turned away from Him. and He has forsaken you. It's only fair. All He wants is your happiness, yet you persist in your sins. Sin is the Lord's executioner - - the destroyer of your souls. It is the cause of your poverty... Why are your cattle thin and frail ? They are not unlike the soul... He's going to increase the corn yield. Don't be afraid - come closer ! The flagstones of your old church - - will not harm you... If I shout, it's only because you're deaf ! Yet, I can whisper to Our Lord, because He hears me... Sit down... The House of Our Lord is your House - - we'll speak to Him as did your forefathers... Discard hatred and spite Less politics and more understanding All of us, hand in hand - - can restore prosperity to this town. Swine ! True ! We're always quarreling! Stop him ! You'd better shut up ! You at the Town Hall Drop it... It's not worth it ... Come along. You're right... Birds of a feather... You left your Sunday market - - and made your first step towards salvation. The revolt for the good of Ars has begun - - nothing will stop it ! We don't want a scandal... Say your health is bad... No. You refuse to go ? No. We'll ask the Bishop ! As you wish. I'll obey him. What about an easy parish ? You hardly earn enough to eat... These potatoes are excellent ! Would you care for one ? Do you think you've won because you've converted a few nitwits ? We won't give in that easily ! You've ignored our bye-laws - - which prohibit processions, meetings and subversive propaganda... Put me in prison ! Maybe... Take care, this is our last warning ! Come in. What are you doing here ? I wish to speak to the Cure. Licking his boots ! What will your husband say ? Don't worry, he'll join us ! What? Ruffin? That'll be the day ! He's worse... What can I do ? I'm sure you can save him ! Me? Oh, no, no... Perhaps, with Our Lord's help... I'll come with you. Careful, M. Vianney... Unqualified practising is illegal... If practising charity is illegal, then I'm at fault ! Where does it hurt, my child ? Has he been ill long ? 6 months. Hasn't he seen a doctor ? There's no doctor... Clement, the bone-setter, looks after him... What has he prescribed ? Weird things... Boiled blood of a black hen killed at moonrise mixed with brandy... Have a drink on us. Your health ! May your business go from bad to worse ! Why? The number of your patients may be reduced... What makes you think that ? Priests often interfere with other people's business - - our priest, particularly ! My patients ? He wouldn't dare ! Yet - if he cured Ruffin's boy ? It may be harmful to you... Ruffin's boy? They wouldn't call him in ! He's there already ! What? Go and see for yourself ! Certain ? I don't tell lies. I'll see to that ! Get some milk and sugar. I'll try feeding him gently. Stop those infernal potions ! They only make him worse... Is your father paralysed ? Yes. When did it happen ? 5 years ago, after a fall - - he's been unable to speak for the past 2 years... We all grow old, sooner or later... Did you call the Cure ? My boy was worse... If something happens, don't blame me ! Of the two of us, you'd be the one to kill the patients ! Henceforth, refrain from witchcraft - - In my parish! You may live to regret this ! We'll see... I'll be back this evening... Was the child baptised ? Yes - but my husband doesn't know. Is he such a brute ? No one would deny that ! The priest? I'll show him the metal I'm made of ! Where is he ? Gone... Did you call him ? Yes. I'll teach you to bring his kind into my house ! No one can stop me ! If he comes again, I'll break his neck ! He will! I'll risk anything to save my child ! Jacques ! Jacques ! My son! My son ! Dead... The priest killed her child! Where's your master ? What do you want of him ? He'll soon know ! He may hide! I'll still find him! I'll murder him ! He's in the church ! Come here, you murderer! What do you want ? You dared... No scandal in this Church... I'll come out, if you wish... Don't try to get away... Mr. Mayor, they're attacking our Cure... They came to the Church. They're sure to kill him ! Admit you killed him ! Quite untrue ! You came in my absence. Only to nurse him. He died after you'd left ! Our Lord called him... He's calling you ! Stop ! If the Cure is guilty, the law will deal with him. Go home and wait... I'll keep watch... Don't bother. Under Our Lord's protection, I'll be safe... Ruffin smashed everything... It was far too rich, anyhow ! I knew this would happen... You can't fight me ! Your so-called God has deserted you... Now then, change your mind and I'll fix everything... St. Philomena ! Poisoned... Did you notice anything ? He prescribed milk and sugar. Dear St. Philomena, protect me... How can you count on her ? She couldn't escape the Roman soldiers' arrows! If she wants, she can reveal the truth... There's no doubt... He's trying to say something... What's the matter ? It's... it's... Cle...ment the... bo...ne-setter... He speaks ! The bone-setter ! Did you see him ? He poured the poi...son in the mug... Clement ? Are you certain ? Dear little Saint, I put my trust in you... Show them- They've arrested the bone-setter... He poisoned the child ! Lord Jesus, St. Philomena heard my prayer... We'll place these relics in a golden casket, in the Church. She will be our patron Saint... 12 Years Later Any improvement ? It takes time... The priest is still here ! He won't get away ! Words ! Same as everyone else ! 12 years - and nobody's dared... Now he's got quite a hold ! Hello Mr. Malray Your contribution, please, to the Charity Fund... You, Catherine ? Will you get out ! This Cure cursed my child and takes my trade ! I'd sooner die than give a penny ! The money goes to the Children's Orphanage. Brats who keep me awake with their singing! Tell him I'll shut their traps, if they don't stop! On the occasion of the Coronation of King Louis-Philippe - - the Council of Ars has decided to organise a 'Fete' next Sunday. The inhabitants are asked to decorate the streets with flags. A Ball will be held at Malray's Tavern. Music - and a torchlight procession ! Another of those dances ! Will they never understand ? Don't give up hope... I shan't... until I die... In this town, wickedness is second nature... A new excuse for dancing... One must have some fun - - but every Commandment condemns dancing. Dancing is the rope used by the devil to drag the Parish into Hell. Our Saviour didn't ask us to lose our souls - - in welcoming a new King who may be worse than the former. " The accession of a new King - " - probably far more tyrannical than his predecessor..." These subversive Republican utterances - - spoken from the pulpit of Ars - - can only encourage the population - - in wishing the downfall of the Monarchy to bring back... Bring back... what ? ... the dark days of terror... Please believe - - in our devotion to His Majesty's cause... Signed by... ? A group of inhabitants of Ars... It'll reach Lyons in the morning... If he's arrested on Fete Day, I'll drink myself silly ! Hello Father. Were these given to you, M. le Cure ? By the good Lady of the Manor... Tell every child that I shall give sweets - - to all those who go on the pilgrimage... There's toffee, almonds and barley sugar... Here's one for you. They won't see people getting drunk... The Cure promises sweets to those who go on the pilgrimage... Tell them all ! Aren't we going to Mass ? Plenty of time... It's a sin to be late... How you've changed ! Let's go, then. May I go too ? Where ? To Church... Your father forbids it ! The Cure is giving away sweets ! He's the one who made you a cripple, poor darling ! By order of the Court - - we've been sent to arrest - - J.M. Vianney, Cure of this town... What for ? Plotting against the King, subversive talk, etc. There must be a mistake ! Wait for me at the Tavern... We'll deal with that later... I'll go with them. Take down the names. We'll leave in the morning. Young Malray ! What brings you here ? Do you want to go on the pilgrimage ? Come closer... What's wrong ? Mother said you'd made me a cripple... Give me back my legs... I can do nothing, my child. Perhaps God made you a cripple so that you may go to Heaven ! Please give them back ! Have you tried without crutches ? No. Try... St. Philomena may intercede in your favour... Try, my child... They're coming back ! Thank you, M. le Cure ! Blessed be the Lord ! Blessed be the Lord ! Look ! Mama ! I've got them back ! He's cured! M. le Cure - The Cure? - gave me back my legs ! A miracle ! Forgive me... The Lord forgives you - - but you've an account to settle with Him... You must be married in church, at the next village... Why don't you marry us ? They've come to arrest me. I won't let them... I accused you... I'll go in your place... Fool ! You accused a Saint ! A Saint... because with God's help, he looks into the soul... Now, he will lavish his gifts on pilgrims coming from eveywhere... Virtually a prisoner in his restored church - - he cleanses the soul from sin - - unceasingly absolving and healing huge crowds - - that flock to the now famous village, by day and by night - - whose last hope is intervention from Heaven. These carriages must be making you a fortune ! It's a disgrace, anyhow ! If this invasion goes on, I'm closing down. Shall we go dancing tonight ? No. What's got hold of you ? Taking the veil, too ? Be less familiar. Well I never... Even the village star attends every Mass She's come to her senses ! Take this back away ! Have her shod in Paradise - - with sacred horseshoes ! I'm through with all of you ! I'm the only one free thinker left. Move on... you can't wait for the Cure here... You've been told your place... As his assistant, you should keep order ! They'll kill him ! As it is, he sleeps barely 2 hours a night ! Can we see him ? We'll let you know... At present, he's praying for you... At last, your hour of triumph ! They're waiting for you... For you to absolve them... to see into their souls... You're somebody, now ! Your picture is in every house... You'll be famous, after death... Your statue will be in every church ! Leave me alone ! Huge crowds have been converted, ailments cured. . . Some day, because of you, the human race might be saved... Admit your defeat - and go ! Fool ! By saving others, you've ruined yourself... Me ? Look into your soul ! It's jet-black ! You think this homage is paid to you... Exalted by this adoration, you think you're God's equal ! How could I be ? You are mine for ever... You'll never lose that sense of pride - a sin... You're lost... Not yet ! I'll fight to the end... I put my trust in the Lord. Did you call me ? You did well to come... Look at the state you're in, after these mortifications... You don't sleep because you've given your bed away... Your penances make you ill ! I've prepared a meal. I'll not be eating. This is madness, you never eat ! You're killing yourself ! I must go, Mme Bibost ! Leave Ars... retire to a Monastery. What next ? Who would bring these people back to God ? I'm losing my soul... But, you're a Saint, M. le Cure ! Don't utter that word ! I'm a sinner ! Come, come... don't lose courage... Go and see your orphans, they'll change your mood ! The Lord listens to all your prayers... Don't say that... I'm a poor sinner... My daughter is very ill... Please pray for her ! She will recover, but you will lose her... She'll become a Nun... What about me ? My poor child ! Stop your wickedness at once or - - you'll finish in hospital, in agony... Trust the Lord, He will help you... You must confess, my friend ! Me ? Yes. They're in a hurry, up above... I will recall your sins... You haven't been to confession since 1825... That's right... At 16, you committed a theft... Does it make a bang ? You'll see ! You may die in peace... The man you absolved has died suddenly... I thank You, O Lord, for letting me know... Some Years Later Was he welcomed at first ? We saw at once that Heaven had sent him... Don't lie, Malray. We tried to turn him away... We behaved badly. He got his own back by converting us. When he healed my son - ls the boy here ? Yes... Paul ? His first miracle... He used to walk with crutches. I don't wish to interrupt but - - could we have a chat? Certainly. I want a word with you, Paul... Let's go outside. Why didn't you turn up ? I was delayed... Don't you love me ? Of course, Louise. Something's between us... No. You've changed... I'm so unhappy ! So am I. Nothing wrong ? Yes . What ? I can't tell you yet... Another girl ? Oh no, Louise! Wait for me here... Won't you eat something? No. Then, you should rest. I'll never rest ! More letters ? Dreadful ones... Listen... ``Disgracing your robes by impersonating a Saint...`` Signed ? "A Cure who honours his robes" Monstrous ! " People think you're a Saint, you're only a sorcerer " A wizard of Heaven! This one is worse... " I had faith, I came to see you. I was not cured. " " Because of you, I have ceased to believe..." They try you too much... They're right... I can't save them all... Come in. My little Paul. . . I bet you want your crutches back. I want to become a priest. I realized, months ago... Don't think you're obliged to, simply because He healed you. Our Saviour expects nothing in exchange... I feel it is my calling. If you went into orders, what would be the result ? A bad priest... Why ? You could never forget Louise Marchand. How did you know ? Your soul is clear as crystal. It's an open book... Go, my boy... She's waiting. Tell her I'll marry you next month. She's a fine girl... The more children you have, the more Catholics on earth... Leaving me ? I must comfort the sick... If you can spare a moment - - pray for me. You don't need my prayers! More than you think ! Do you hear ? What is it ? The moaning of the damned... You'll be amongst them, soon... I wan't ! ! Among the souls you have led astray... I'll pray for them... You'd better know... I performed your miracles ! No - it was God ! Your divine gift was mine... Liar ! Admit my triumph or else... Never ! Then go - unless you wish to die of terror ! I'm the master of the world... Others, before you, had to succumb... I belong to my Lord ! Go - at once ! I always get my way. Now that you've left, I'll profect you... You'll be happy... Well ? Nothing ! He went in that direction... Where are you going? Don't worry about me... Come, come... You must return with us ! I wish to retire - - and be forgiven my sins... But you're a Saint ! If you could see my soul ! Return for my sake... Who would bless our marriage ? Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! What's wrong ? The Rectory is on fire ! See ? The Devil doesn't want me there ! All the more reason... It's on fire... The Cure ? He was out... Another miracle, they'll say ! If this continues, horseshoes may one day forge themselves ! They'll drive me crazy ! ! Oh Father. . . Your bed is a cinder... I'll sleep on the floor... Why did you leave ? I don't know... It was childish. So, you dared to come back ? Yes. I'll find other means... No. Sure of yourself, aren't you ? I am... ...sure of the affection of those who brought me back - - I shall never leave Ars ! I'll keep on relentlessly... Poor fool ! You can harm me no more. I don't wish to hear you and I won't - any longer ! We'll see... I'm not through yet ! When I'm attacked, I never give in ! A great honour for us - - that H.M. the Emperor - - has decided to award the Legion of Honour to J.M. Vianney... There's method in his madness! Our town benefits by our Cure's fame, anyhow! Your father was his enemy ! Respect the dead ! Not the turncoats ! Like them, I preferred the lining to the cloth ! I'll wear my coat as before... It's filthy either way ! Leave him to his obsession... No, Sir, I'm not obsessed ! In 68 years, I've seen 7 governments... The Republic, Napoleon, Louis XVIII (18), Charles X (10), Louis-Philippe- - the 2nd Republic, the 2nd Empire ! I've seen liberty and oppression - - seen men change opinions- as they changed masters ! Weaned under Robespierre - - I refuse to lead the destinies of this stronghold of clericalism ! Rather than sit here, I'd' sooner wait - - until democracy turns out the tyrants ! I tender my resignation ! Good riddance ! He's jealous of the Cure's triumph ! As the first Mass must be over - I suggest we leave for the Rectory. You want to resign ? Why ? I'm still being paid as a sacristan, but - - I'm nearly 100 years old - - and not much use ! You've been my faithful servant since I came... You will remain to the end... What a lot of people! Have you all come to see me ? Yes Father. Jean Marie Vianney - - I have been ordered to confer on you - - the Cross of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour... I thank you, Mr. Mayor, but I'm not worthy... You deserve it... I deserve nothing. Give it to Lebourg, who lost his legs in the Crimea. That's not possible... The Emperor awarded it to you. Quite a nice medal... What is it made of ? Silver-gilt... Then I'll take it - - I'll sell it to buy food for my orphans ! Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for coming here - - although you're one short... One of your colleagues I would have liked to see... He's as stubborn as a mule ! Still, I must win him over. He's the only black sheep in the flock ! ON SUNDAY- BUSINESS AS USUAL Now, the Cure of Ars is dying... Worn out by privations - - and his intense religious activity - - he prepares to meet God - - adorned with the glory of the Saints... Let our thoughts dwell upon him - - let us ask God to spare him the torments of death... You're crying, M. le Cure ? I'm sad at the thought - - of this last Communion... But you'll soon be with Our Lord - - in the midst of those you brought back to Him... So many still to be converted ! The Lord is so merciful... If we can't go to Him - - it is He Who comes... St. John Vianney died on August 4, 1859. at the age of 73. Because of his impending beatification, his body was exhumed on June 17, 1904. Against all the laws of medicine and science, the Saint's body was discovered to be completely incorrupt. And it remains so to this day, displayed in a special glass coffin and his shrine in Ars, France. Pope St. Pius X (10) beatified him on January 8, 1905. Pius XI (11) canonised him on May 31, 1925. and in 1929 the Church proclaimed him patron Saint of all the parish priests throughout the world. THE END LE SORCIER DU CIEL (Octobre 14, 1949).
