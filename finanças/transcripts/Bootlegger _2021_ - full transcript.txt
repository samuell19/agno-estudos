Are you ready, Mani? Yes. I like it, Frankie. I almost lost all of my French. Thank you. See you soon. Hello sweetheart. Hello mushum. Do you recognize the road? The roads are still all the same. We are proud of your success, even if it means we don't get to see you much. Grandma is waiting for you. She'll be so happy to see you. I'll be in the shed if you're looking for me. Grandma? It's been so long since I hugged you. Winter came late this year. We were able to keep the summer camp longer at the river. It has always been my favourite spot. Your Algonquin is rusty. Give me your foot. What happened? Nothing, it was just a dog. Were you alone? I don't need anyone. What about grandpa? It's been a long time since I've eaten moose. This moose is a gift I received two days ago. It's good that you're here. There's a band council meeting tonight. I'd like you to represent us. It's going to be too late for us. Please, please, let's stick to the agenda or we'll be here till midnight! Brenda. I'm going to fight to keep the reserve dry because I want to protect my kids. I find it very irresponsible to even think of bringing legal booze in our community. That's what I think and there's no way I'll vote for that. I disagree, prohibition makes things even worse. I promise you the Band Council is looking for options! Voting is the solution! Ã‰ric. Oscar. I work all the time and I need help. Training recruits is our priority. You have to give it time. It's not enough. We put checkpoints at the entrances to the reserve. It's the best I can do. Booze comes in anyway. And there is no one to point the finger. We do a lot with what little we've got. When are we going to get the new school you promised? Trust me. We're working on it. It'll come soon. It's always the same, nothing but lies. I don't believe a word of it. Please, please. We'd like to give everyone a chance to speak. I see those who come to the reserve full of greed thinking only of getting rich and then they go back south! Well, we won't solve all our problems tonight. I'll take your comments into consideration. Don't forget to collect your Christmas gift. Raymond and I are offering everyone a frozen turkey. Laura will meet you outside. The past year has not been easy. I'm proud of you. We rolled up our sleeves to take on some big challenges. On behalf of the band council, I wish you Happy Holidays. Thank you, everyone. Thank you all for your presence. We thank the Creator for our day and for his presence and all his creations. We now each go our own way guided by the Creator's will. The meeting is now adjourned and may our return home be protected. Hello Mani! I wasn't sure it was you. It's been a while. Too long. Things are really tense here! It's often like that, these days. They voted for me but it didn't please everyone. How is law school going? A graduate in the family, that's a big deal! I try to make my own way. Have a good evening. Here. Got something else for me? No, that's all for today. You're kidding? Everyone gets the same. Here. You can keep it. It's a gift. Didn't expect to see you here. You haven't changed. I'm a father now. I see you have a say in the community. Yes, but I'm not the one who makes the decisions. Did you know there are stray dogs roaming around my grandparent's house? You need to speak to Raymond. He takes care of that. I'd rather it were you. Come, I'll give you a lift. You really chose the right evening to show up. At least people are speaking their minds. That's encouraging, no? You think so? Jeanne is halfway through her term and nothing's moved. It really pisses me off. Is there still as much booze around as before? It's worse than ever. She just turns a blind eye. She's not the one who gets called to people's homes at 3 am. She's not the one who has to pick up the wounded. The situation's dead serious. Things are going to explode. You're the one who's going to explode. What brings you back here? I've come to complete my research project. You come here you take and you leave. You never felt like leaving? Some have the courage to leave... and others have the courage to stay. Pass it here. Show me your ID. Come on, Joe. Give it to me. This is for you, Pete. We love you, buddy. Hope you have all you need, wherever you are. You left us too soon, Pete. Make sure to watch over us! Here's to our future! Here's your taxi ride, Paul! This won't be cheap. Just leave us alone! I told you before, not to come here at night. Why don't you get off our backs! You're lucky I take care of you. It's just fucking bullshit! Empty that. Where do you buy it? Made it ourselves. You'll go blind if you keep drinking that garbage. I don't want to see it or hear about it again. That goes for everyone. It's time you thought about your future. I'm gonna be your boss. How's city life? Fewer trees, less air. More buildings, more people, more of everything. You're nothing but a fucking racketeer! We should have thrown you out of the reserve long ago. I don't know what Raymond's doing with you. You've got a stick up your ass. Whatcha looking at? Don't miss the next bingo on our airwaves this Thursday at 6 p.m. I remind you that there's a pack of dogs loose in the community. And they're getting more aggressive. Please call to report a dog that's endangering you or your family. Try some, it'll warm you up. Why do you come here to hide? A long time ago, I was arrested because of a law forbidding ''Indians'' from drinking alcohol. Not just here, but everywhere. That's the reason why I come here. I don't want anyone to judge me because of my past and the events at that time. Here, it is peaceful. Everywhere. Silence helps me think. My mind feels freer here, I can plan ahead. I'm happy in the woods. Just like at the crack of dawn, as the time passes, the sun gets brighter, winning over the darkness. In the end, both you and your wisdom will follow this path. No matter what battles you're waging, you're bound to win some and lose some. But still, with your knowledge, you'll always be able to move forward! As long as I live, I'll help you. You'll never be alone. Several communities have held referendums on prohibition. We could follow their example. Wait, we're not there yet. Prohibition is an old paternalist law. It comes from a time when the government treated us like minors. Yes, but that's no longer the case today. It's our decision to ban alcohol. It doesn't work. If everyone gets to vote, it would be a good example of empowerment. The registration is quickly done online. You just need to submit it with the signatures of the members of the council. We don't have the programs in place to support free alcohol. Programs could be created. With income from controlled sales, you could have funds for your new school. Or whatever services you consider a priority. Otherwise it's the bootleggers who make the profit. It's a goldmine for them. Here things work differently than in the city. If the system doesn't work, you can change it. You must ask the people to vote. You show up with your cowboy education and you want to tell us how to work? You don't know what's best for us. Raymond! Mani needs an internet connection. We'll put her in the visitor trailer while she's here. Can you do this? You've changed. You've become a woman. I hope you won't stay too long. I don't want to stir up old memories. The order ready yet? Yes, come in. You're going back to the reserve tonight? Yes, I'll finish loading this. How much longer are you gonna keep doing this? Laura! I recognized your little ass. It's been forever since that last time in my truck. When was it? Six? Seven years ago? Whatcha doing here? Left your Indian at home? Are you in town to buy him a leash? Maybe a collar? Come on. Bye. Hello! Hello, Laura. All good. For you, Georges. Good night. And now for the weather, the vast Algonquin territory is overcast. Some light snow is forecast and the temperature's expected to drop. We'll have to wait a few days before going out on the lakes. Be patient, ice fishing should begin soon. The Algonquin word of the day is oushkinabich, meaning: I'm fed up! You can start with that. Good morning. Did you receive the products I ordered? Yes, at the end of the aisle. A sandwich and 2 shots of whisky please. Hear you've received some good stuff. Find everything? Yes. It came fast this time. I called them to put pressure on the delivery. I'll have a pack of Players Light. Kids are well? Yes. Excited for the holidays and for Santa. Well, send my best to the family. Happy holidays. You manage well in Algonquin. Thank you. Seems to me that it is minimum when you live here. That's $7.90. You want me to dock an hour off your pay? Get going, you little shit. If you wish, we can call the police. Little shit! Get out! What's this? CALL TO ALL. LOOKING FOR TESTIMONIALS FOR A STUDY PROJECT. I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU! COME SEE ME AT THE VISITORS' CENTRE! FREE ENTRANCE EVERY DAY BETWEEN 10:00 A.M. AND 5:00 P.M. MANI BRAZEAU, GRANDAUGHTER OF NORA AND JOHNNY BRAZEAU. Devilwoman! You know that Fire Water always finds the crack in everything and you encourage it to burn all on its path. Until there is not a single breath of life left. Johnny, I don't have time for bedtime stories. You grow wiser with age? C'mon Johnny, in a couple of hours, you'll beg for it. Where's the rest? Here's some moose meat. What am I supposed to do with this? You'll have to answer for your actions one day. Without this meat, your greed will starve you so much that we'll find your skeleton on the side of the road. What wrong, my boy? Little shits. Sit! Gently. Sit! Sit! Fuck. Mani, get up! Raymond! Stay! I want to take my daughter out! Get down. At least he's here! Yes, but on a leash. I have to go to work. Let's cuddle a bit. Thanks for coming. I'll ask you some questions. If you're not comfortable, we'll stop. I want to know if the laws that govern us are still valid today? Are we able to pass on our values even if it's been more than a century that we've been forced to assimilate? My grandmother always says that young people are the bridge between the past and the future. You, Paul, how do you see your future? I hope he'll do better than his dad. After high school, I'd like to go to the music conservatory. That's good! But you'll be far from your friends and family. What I want to learn isn't offered here. So I have no choice. Do you believe that's realistic for future generations? Our youth who've acquired education must first and foremost come back to serve their community. Whoever starts living like the white folks you see on TV becomes assimilated. Above all, you must be Indigenous. Some say that when we drink white people's alcohol, we participate in our own colonization. What do you think? I understand that people who don't drink want to keep it banned. But others do it in secret. I find that's worse. Like everywhere else, money rules the world. There are people selling it here who have the money to buy trucks and burn 300 kilometers worth of gas just to buy booze. It's the poorest that pay for that. I wanted to become a policeman to make a difference. I was full of enthusiasm. I wanted to change the world. I never would have imagined it would be so demanding. Hello Rita. I lost my daughter because of alcohol. It's not your fault. I'm not the one Raymond should've saved from the fire. I'm not a big talker. But I brought a poem. I'd like to read it to you. I'd love to hear it. My bones are hurting Shaking from a lack of words The pain has settled Unable to tell that yesterday Has slipped from my grasp I dream of a story that would tell without fail A whole life lived You don't look at me You don't see me You don't hear me You don't listen to me You deprive me of my identity You deprive me of my land You want to be the master of my spirit Who am I? You don't know me You don't know my legends You don't know my history Don't wait till I get angry like a hurricane Don't wait till I break my chains We should offer more help to alcoholics than punish the whole community. Also, we could control our young people because we'd be the ones selling it. Not the outsiders. When you know where the sore is and don't take care of it. How can it heal? - It's the referendum on prohibition. We don't want it on the reserve. I'd like people to know that whatever the outcome, there'll be no turning back. Did you want to tell us something about this Mani? Yes. Why does prohibition exist? It was a way for the government to assimilate us. In order to get access to alcohol, you had to become a Canadian citizen and give up your Indian Status. If you wanted to vote, you had to relinquish your status. If you wanted to study, you had to relinquish your status. We were never winners in this. That's why what's happening now is important. You have the power to make a difference, to change things with a vote. Aren't you afraid of what could happen if we opened a liquor store on the reserve? No. I'm not afraid. The community will gain pride, if it takes control. I have three children at home and I have to boil the water. I can't give them baths. It's easier to have access to booze than drinking water. That's the problem. If you want to participate in the conversation. Give us a call. We want to hear your opinions. Yes. Hello. I'd like to come back to what Mani was saying and the scars left on our families. When are you going to shut the lawyer up? You have to stop bringing in stock until things calm down. Don't you have a school to build? Your business works because I close my eyes. You close your eyes. And I shut my mouth. You shouldn't let this happen to you. You're losing your power. Can I count on you? Hello. We heard you speak on the radio. Bringing more alcohol here is irresponsible and dangerous. The violence that happens here is often related to alcohol. We are worried about our youth, our lives and our traditions and for the leaders of future generations. Do you understand? It took almost four generations to destroy us, and it could take four more generations to heal us. We understand your motivations but your ideas are breaking us apart instead of unifying us. Give it here. Why didn't you come to my defense? Bring me my tobacco. You had me do this when I was little. I always loved it. Are you sure you're not cold. It's okay. I find it difficult to put down roots. I run away when it gets too intense. I would really like to be able to say that in our language. I do not know how to express my anger. I shouldn't have waited so long to come see you. What the hell does he want. Damn. What the fuck! What? Little thug. What's going on? Empty your pockets. We always said never to kids. That's for the tax. And don't tell anyone. Now beat it. Beat it! You've gone too far. Either you help me or you shut the fuck up. Don't make that face! Who's the one that profits from my god damn business? Bunch of hypocrites! It's all for you Paul. Happy birthday buddy! We start again tomorrow. What the heck. What's this? Damn. Little shits. YES TO A REFERENDUM. What are you doing? Give me a hand! If you split, don't ever come back, you son of a bitch! Damn it. Do you see the bark of this tree? It tells a lot about the tree's life. It's injured but still standing. Will you be able to find your snares under the snow? I've been walking on this land all my life. I give you 24 hours, no more. That's the best I can do for you, Laura. You don't belong here anymore.
