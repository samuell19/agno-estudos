REMAINS OF A MAN I won't eat this animal. Hear about the Culmann family on the radio yesterday? No. We're out of batteries. What happened? Their grandson traveled. The old couple was alone at home. Two scumbags broke in to steal their money. Stabbed them both to death. Chopped them up, they found Mrs. Cuma's finger... way over at the storehouse. What's that on your face, Luana? It's nothing. It was out in the woods. Fry an egg for us. Are you gonna eat that thing dry, Luana? I'm going. We'll find a day to harvest the corn. Miguel. Try to come home before sundown. What's up, Alceu! Come and get me now! Come on! Let's see it! Come on! Aren't you going to eat? I'll wait for your father. Can you check on your window if he's coming? Come on, Israel! Come on! Here you go! Israel! Here. Can you do the burial? Can you organize the wake? A daughter shouldn't bury her father. I don't want Luana to go through this. All right? Shall we pray? Lord... Give me reasoning to overcome... My illusions. And increase my days of smiles. What are you doing, Luana? What is this? What is this? Take that off! Take that off, Luana! Take it off! You were just supposed to disappear! How did you get in here? It was open. I just wanted a glass of water. But I locked the door. Have you seen Luana? I came by the highway. Well... Now we'll have to check... the harvest, before the rain comes. It won't be easy, Miguel worked for two men. What about you? - And the girl? - She's fine! I'll go by fast, before school begins. From the boss, for your expenses. I put some in there as well. What is this? You can take your cut from it! Oh, no. It's a gift. Miguel would do the same for me. I saw the corn out there in your farm. If you want I can stay the night... And help with the harvest early tomorrow Luana, go to your room! Don't get me wrong, ma'am. Miguel was my friend, he'd always cover for me when I... Found work somewhere else. An uncle is coming to live with us. There's no need! Well... If you need anything, I'll be around. I know how you feel, ma'am. My wife's gone too. We could go live in a different city. At your hometown, at the beach. Is a relative coming to live with us, mother? No, Luana. Now you're all I have. How old were you when you met Miguel? Stop calling your father by his name. I was a bit older than you. Eat the bread, Luana! The food's all at the storehouse. I'll go out there. No! Eat the bread. We'll get it tomorrow. I want food, mom! It's not dark yet. - I'll go! You stay here! - No, Luana! No way! I told you not to come here, Luana! Did you let the dog out? No. Hurry up, Luana, go! Luana! Who's there? Who's there, Luana? Come! Luana! Luana! Come, Israel. Come! Come here! Luana! Go, Israel! Fetch! Come here! Come here, Luana! Come! He's passed out, mom. You don't know that, Luana! We can't leave him out there! Move away, Luana! He's barely moving. He'll be gone tomorrow. Leave him! Grab his feet! Go! Go! Fetch some pants. And a shirt. Did I fall? Honey... What time is it? It's morning already. There's just some beans to clean. You're coming along. What if he wants to go out? No good even for a mop. Luana, clean the shoes. Here. You were doing that face that father doesn't like. Daughter... Can you hang that for me? Luana! To find a good husband, a woman must know how to do laundry. Then how come you didn't find one? It's so strange to see the bruises, feel the pain. And not remember what happened. What happened? You don't remember anything at all? You went out and came back like this. I remember flashes. I remember a dog attacking me. Just don't hit him again. I don't hit dogs! I like dogs, I like animals. Mika. That was my cat when I was a teenager. I remember my teenage years. My college exam. But then... How long have we been here? You're on her seat. I'm sorry. What about that hair? Luana! Don't you comb your hair before breakfast? I'm sorry. Your father will soon be better. She'll be fine. It's nothing. Don't you remember me, boy? It's me! It's me! Remember? Look! It's me! Come on! I don't want beans. - You always eat beans. - Let it go, Renata. Daughter, you're old enough to serve your own plate. I've always liked your cooking. Nair used to cook potatoes just like this when I was a kid. If she didn't cook, I wouldn't eat. She'd always tell me to straighten up, you know? "Sit up straight, boy! Correct those shoulders!" "Lift up that chin!" Aunt... Bezinha. She was a maid. But that one only taught me naughtiness. - You met Nair, right, mother? - No, of course not! Nair was from when I was a child, just like you. I never had a maid at home. Your grandma would get jealous. Grandma? Whenever I praised Nair's food you know what she did? She kicked me! From under the table. Eat, Luana! It's good, but there's no meat. We don't eat meat, Lui! I've told you. I thought we just didn't slaughter. When are you going to cook Sp채tzle, mother? Sp채tzle! You know how to cook Sp채tzle? Yes. Don't go. We're not done! Not me or your daughter. Don't go! Didn't you say you were going to clean the courtyard? No, I didn't. I said that? You did. You have to help me. - You're crazy. - You startled me! - Who would you rather have in here? - No one! Quiet! Close the door. Help me. No one needs to stay here. Look what happened. Look. I cut myself. Look, daughter. What will you cook with the potatoes? Maybe some mashed potatoes. Hum. I feel like eating the potato salad... that I used to eat in Germany. So tasty. Too bad I went there so young. I barely enjoyed it. Such a cry-baby back then. But it was good. I got to see the snow. How's the snow? Can you eat it? Of course not. It's filthy. And cold. I'd wear some eight pieces of clothing. Blouse, shirt, coat scarf, cap... But the cold was so cold that... It passed through the fabric and onto your skin. Like canned wind. The worst was the nose. Walking on the street, breathing that cold air all day long. Oh. Come here. Let me show you. Sort of like this. Put your face in there. Breathe. Now picture that all day long. It would freeze your cheeks, you can't even smile. When I was a child, my mother... kept a fur coat that belonged to my great-grandmother. I was dying to wear it, but she wouldn't let me touch it because... just by touching it the fur would come off. If I ever go to Germany, I... Want to have a fur coat. Remember that day with the frost? I missed school to stay home with my feet inside the oven. To warm myself. - Remember? - I remember. Is that your uncle? Who? That guy in there. - Oh, that's... - That's the uncle who sleeps with you. Luana told me. Since when do you talk to Luana? I could break your neck right here. And I mean it. If you don't give me a cigarette. Erm... Don't you have those that come ready? This one's ready. I'll bring more for you later. Can you roll up a couple for me? Three. You should get back to the farm. You can go. I'll head back to work. See you around. Nice fella. You had quit smoking. Well, I won't mind forgetting that. Who is he? Friend of the family. Imagine my father... who always lived inside an apartment, seeing me like this. Do you have any news from him? All I know is you two had a fight, Lui. Was it? Do you know why? Oh, I don't know. He never wanted to discuss it with me. But why bring this up now, Lui? The old man's stubborn. Here. Luana. Change that shirt, daughter. Put one for your size. Pour me some. Hey, I want some! Hey... Hey, skinny! Who did this girl take after? To which side is the city? You have to weed this out. Oh, no. That's enough, Renata. I'm not cut out for this. Here... Look at my hand. It's almost bleeding. It's not like yours... You have hardened hands. Look. No, but I like them. I like them! I like them like that! Just like that. Here. I like them. I'll... I'll cook your lunch. You... You can finish here for me. Good morning. Good morning. I thought you'd never wake up. That smell woke me up. Sp채tzle. Careful, it's hot. You were doing your alien face again. - Dad doesn't like it. - Of course I like it. It's cute. Don't you think so, Luana? We're out of milk. I'll buy some. I'll buy some meat tomorrow, this is bird food. Sorry, honey, but it is. I'll only do the "ranch" next month. The "ranch"? The monthly groceries, the "ranch". I can kill a chicken! We always do that. You know how to kill? I hunt too. You don't know how to hunt. You have to be agile to hunt. - I am. - You have to be sly. Have good aim. I have. Reflex. Then I also know how to hunt. No, you don't! Only Luana does these things. This girl sometimes seems like a caveman. Come, Israel! Come! Israel! Is that a dog's name? I gave him that name. Right. Go on, Lui! Why are you calling me by my name? That's how it's always been. Always? And I never complained? No. Quick or they'll escape! Let's see if you remember how to catch a chicken. Oh I will. But only if you call me dad. Go on, dad! Hi, Mrs. chicken! Hi, Mrs. chicken. That's a rooster! Oh yeah? Can't I grab him? No. Grab it by the tail. Better by the neck! No, pull its tail. Come, come! They escaped, but you won't... You'll never grab that chicken. Is that so? Go on! Show me. I want to see. I taught you just right. Where do you do it? Here! Don't you need this? No. Damn... Hand me the bucket, Lui. Aren't you going to eat? You said you wanted meat. I will. Who came by here today, Renata? No one. I said you didn't like meat. I saw the car. It was a... Salesman. It was a police car, Renata. What police car, Lui? Are you crazy? Lui... Calm down! Calm down! What did I do? What did I do? Don't move. Don't move. Leave it, leave it. Leave it, leave it Tell me. What were you going to tell me? What were you going to tell me? What was it? Say it! I've been meaning to ask you something for a while. Well, then ask. Well, I didn't find my documents in the house. What day was I born? - December 1st. - I thought you remembered... December 1st? Not long ago. Right? Why didn't we celebrate? We can't have that. Let's celebrate! Let's have a party. Shall we have a party? We'd always throw parties back home. You know that. Let's invite everyone! Let's... Kill a boar! - Kill some chickens! - You don't kill anything. Now I know. By the neck, right? Come on! Let's... Have some music! Let's put some music on, honey. And dancing, lots of dancing! Come here! Let's go! Dance! Let's dance! Let's celebrate! This house needs dancing, music... And partying, people, come on! Come on! Stop it Lui! It's Luis to you! I want a cigarette! Where are the cigarettes? You stored them, right? Where are they? Do we have any left? Where are they, Renata? Where are the cigarettes? On top of the fridge. Come, Luana. Let's collect the clothes, it's about to rain. Why did you tell him.... That his birthday is on the day of your father's death? What's the problem? Let's throw a party. You don't know anything, Luana! Then let's go away! You want to go away? Your father and I worked hard for everything we have here. You don't even like it here. This is all we have, Luana! This is ours! He's not ours! Luana! Lui! Give me one. You know how to smoke? Here. Put it further in your mouth. Pull harder! Your mother's right. You do look like a caveman like that. Come here. Wait. Do I still remember this? With this here. You'll be less of a caveman. To become... A modern man. Are your preys always smaller than you? There's no large animals around here. Doesn't that bother you? Where's my daughter? Where is she? Where were you? Where did you two go? Why did you lock me out of the house? What did you do to my daughter? Luana! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door, Luana! Aren't you going to say something? You want me to say something? Speak or I'll blow your brains out! What harm would a father do to his daughter? Mother! He didn't do anything. The door is open! Where are the car keys? I'll take you to the doctor. I'll drive. They'll call you by your name.
