-[birds chirping] -[rhythmic breaths] [radio in Spanish] [in Spanish] Irma will sleep at my mom's so we can go to the movies. -[man] Oh, okay. -Don't be late. Don't worry, I'll be there at six. [man shouting outside] Okay. -Not hungry? -I'm running late. Give Daddy a hug. Her braid. [girl laughing] -Big kiss for Mommy. -[man] Here, Mommy. [kissing] -Love you. -Me too. Have a good day. Wish Daddy a good day. -[kisses] -[horn honks] [bus honks] [indistinct shouting] [indistinct radio] [radio grows louder] [radio static] [engine fires] -Ready? -Ready. Go. [wind whistles] [wind whistles] Coming to lunch? Meet you there. [staticky voice from radio] [another voice from radio] -[radio feedback] -[cable clatters] [radio signal clicking] [feedback fades to a buzz] [suspenseful music playing] Are you Olga Salanueva, René González's wife? Did something happen? We're from the Ministry of the Interior. He had an accident? Is he alive? He's alive, not hurt. Comrade Salanueva, your husband is in Florida. He defected. He stole a plane, flew under our radar, landed at a U.S. airbase in Miami. [camera shutters clicking] [in English] Had you been planning this for some time, sir? The escape took me three months to prepare. To--to plan. But I had already said goodbye to Cuba many years ago. Why did you defect? In Cuba, everything's short. Electricity. Food. Everything. Potato, rice, even sugar... is rationed. Every drop of fuel for our airplanes is counted. I'm a pilot. I don't want to go on living like that. Does it mean you will be applying for political asylum? I don't need to. I was born in Chicago. So I'm an American citizen and I'm very proud of it. [in Spanish] If you receive the slightest information, it is your duty to inform us immediately. You can count on it. [sighs] [dialing numbers] [phone ringing] [line connects] [man] Hello. Roberto, you heard about your brother? Listen-- I need your help getting through this. I'll come over later. I'll tell our parents first. Okay. Then we'll tell Irma. It'll be hard for her to understand why he abandoned her. But I'll be there with you. Okay? I'll help you. [melancholic music playing] [sirens blaring] [man] René, your new home. -Thanks. -You're welcome. [man] Rent is paid. Three months should give you time to get settled. [man] It's basic, but don't worry. We'll help you get more stuff. Who should I thank? [man] The CANF. Cuban American National Foundation. Jorge Mas Canosa. [man] Our president. [man] He will rebuild Cuba. Anything you need for your work, your family, ask him. You start tomorrow, Opa-locka airport. As a flight instructor. Pay's not great, but you can earn extra on the side. [melancholic music continues] [sighs] [engine running] [in English] So you think I'm ready for my first solo? Not yet, we need to work on your landing. -Okay. -We try it again next week, okay? [in Spanish] May I sit with you? Let me introduce myself. No need. You're José Basulto. At your service. "Arch-enemy of the Cuban Revolution." For me, that's a badge of honor. [Basulto] You fought in Angola. Tank commander. Two years in the jungle. 54 missions. Good reasons for us to get along. Why? We need men like you. I'm not a politician. [Basulto] Ever hear of Gregorio Pérez Ricardo? The kid was 15 when he fled Cuba on a raft. But he wasn't as lucky as you. The U.S. Coast Guard found him so dehydrated, they couldn't revive him. So we set up an organization called "Brothers to the Rescue", to help our brothers. So nothing like that ever happens again. How do you plan to do that? Eriberto, a coffee. Want one? Sure. Two. You know that I used to be a violent man. Trained by the U.S. as a terrorist. My hero was John Wayne. But not anymore. Now I'm a kind of... Jedi. Like Luke Skywalker. The Force is with us. Understand? Sort of. It's all about solidarity, humanism. We'll go find rafters in the sea and guide them to freedom. Thank you. By monitoring the ocean. [Basulto] We have the planes but we don't have enough pilots like you. It's $25 a run, plus 25 per flight hour. Who pays? [Basulto] Jorge Mas Canosa. Money is not a problem for him. The collapse of the Soviet Union has raised people's hopes. And yet... Castro is holding on. Without Russian money, he won't last long. When the regime collapses, they'll have to return the refineries, banks, factories. And casinos! The stakes are enormous for every exile. Take yourself. You left your family there. You're a brave man. You fled communism. You started over here in Miami. But... you have a choice to make. Keep on gardening... or help bring democracy to our country. [intensifying engine whir] [voices crying out] [René in English over radio] November 2-5-0-6 to base. Two rafts spotted at 24-53 by 81-42, drifting north/north-east. About 20 people aboard. I repeat, 20 people aboard. -[people shouting] -[plane engine grows louder] [René] Dropping now, I repeat, dropping now. -[shouts continue] -[René] Dropping now. -[loud splash] -[all shouting] -[loud splash] -[shouting continues] [in Spanish] You saved them. Coast Guard on the way! -Those poor people. -Good job. I hope they make it. Sure they will. Look... Hey, a gift from Willy Chirino. Really? [Basulto] And that one... Gloria Estefan. Damn! Ask her to come christen it. Good idea but don't get your hopes up. [René laughs] [René in Spanish over radio] What are you doing? We're crossing Parallel 24. Entering Cuban airspace. Listen. We're not just a humanitarian organization. We're a militant organization. [in English] Good afternoon, Havana. This is November 2-5-0-6. We are crossing Parallel 24. Today, our operations will be -in the northern part of Havana. -[radio static] [man on radio] Received, but I inform you that the area north of Havana is active. You will be at risk. Copy. We are aware of the risk. But, as free Cubans, we are prepared to take it. [jet engine approaches and zooms past] [in Spanish] They're showing off. Showing off, my ass. [laughs] [Spanish guitar music playing] [Basulto] Take over. Follow the Malecon. [Basulto] Turn right. [paper flapping in air] [all shouting and screaming] COMRADES NO! BROTHERS! [René in voiceover] Dear Olga, You haven't answered my letters. I understand your reasons. But understand mine. I'm a pilot. I don't want to be a flight instructor all my life. It's always tough at first but this is a land of opportunities. There are plenty for all of us. I'm checking out schools for Irma. [Olga in voiceover] Dear René, I've received your many letters. I'm so saddened by this, I can't open them. Here, life is very difficult. Blackouts last eight hours, and it's difficult to find food. It's harder and harder to get by on my own. Irma is a big girl now. She's asking questions. I hate lying to her. I don't want her to learn her father's a traitor. Believe it or not, last week we got robbed. They took all our valuables. But I'm a fighter, you know that. You also know I'm not angry with you. I wish you luck in your new life. But I regret to tell you, it won't be with me. [children playing] [birds chirping] [engine approaches and recedes] [breathing with effort] [deep breaths] [gasps] [heavy breathing] [bubbling water] [waves crashing] [gasping] [soldier in English] Freeze! -Don't shoot! -[siren wails] -[rifle loads] -I am a Cuban officer! -I am defecting! -[dogs barking] [man] My military I.D. My pilot's log. [American officer] Who's this guy? He's my friend. Arnaldo Ochoa. Hero of the Cuban Revolution. Hero of the war in Angola. He was arrested and executed. For drug smuggling. An associate of Pablo Escobar also. No. That's what the regime says when they want to get rid of an opponent. Thank you. [moans, laughs] Eat up. For someone who's been eating McCastro's for years... [laughs] McDonald's is a delicacy. Come on, why now? General Ochoa was executed three years ago. I didn't think the regime would survive the end of the Soviet Union. [inhales] And it did. [sighs] But then my brothers, Alejandro and Raúl, also fighter pilots, they were less patient than me. They tried to run away but got arrested and imprisoned. Do you have any family? Any children? [sniffs] My wife, Amelia, and two children. Will they be joining you in the States? We are divorced. And she has custody of the children. [PA in English] May I have your attention, please. This is the final boarding call... [men speaking indistinctly] [in Spanish] The couch is the best I can do. -Don't worry about it. -It'll help for a while. It's perfect, thanks. [upbeat music playing] Listen... We have associations that help defectors. But let me ask you something. Why did you come? To deliver pizzas or to strike it rich? -What about you? -[laughs] Me? I'm a biznero, dude. You know me. A little bit of everything. And that's enough? [in English] No way, man. [laughs] [in Spanish] What do you think? So? Should I tell you? I'm also an FBI informer. I update them on the community's mood. And the pay is good. Big money! [singing in Spanish] [both singing] Thank you for the mass. Really good. Thank you. -Ana, hey! -[laughing] No! -[in English] How are you? -I'm good. -It's been a long time. I can't believe it -Oh, my God. How have you been? -I've been good. You look great! -The family, good? You know what? Let me introduce you to somebody. -Okay. -Come here. [in Spanish] Cousin, come here. [in English] This is my cousin, Juan Pablo Roque. -Very nice meeting you. -[Ana] Hi. Nice meeting you. You're the officer who swam to the U.S. base. Yeah, that's me. I know Guantanamo Bay. You're not afraid of sharks? Sharks, uh... I was lucky. [laughs] Did anyone tell you you look like a movie star? -Well, I am a movie star. -[laughs] Or I like to think that I'm sexier than a movie star, actually. [Ana laughs] [Ana] Thank you. That was a lovely evening. Was it lovely because you... liked the movie? [laughs] [sighs] Not only. So... so I think we will see each other again. [door softly opens] [whispering] Wait. [gasps] No. -[softly] Why? -[firm] Because I have to go. I-- [sighs] I don't want my ex-husband to see us. Your ex-husband? Yes. He's moving out. But his apartment is being renovated. So, he's staying with me in the meantime. Is it over between you? -Yes! -So? I just... I'm afraid of him. He's violent. I'll protect you. [laughs] You'll be my bodyguard? -Yes. Like in the movie tonight. -Like Kevin Costner for Whitney Houston? -Yeah. -Oh, God. [both moaning] [Ana groans] [whispering] I'm gonna go. We'll meet again. [firm] We'll meet again! [door slams] [in Spanish] You're a friend of Nico Gutiérrez's? His personal trainer. Great! Well, Nico... suggested I call you. He's working out. I've told him to for ages. Look, Basulto. [Basulto] Your pilot's log. I was a major in the Air Force. I used to fly MiGs. [Basulto] You're more experienced than me. Want to fly again? I left Cuba... to fight the Castros. In our organization, there's an elite group. We call them the kamikazes. I'd like to know what it's about. We don't respect safety rules or the laws of aeronautics. Meaning? If you join us, you'll be flying 9-hour days, 7 days a week, every month, no breaks. [in English] Full time. [in Spanish] My friend... That's illegal. [laughs] Illegal... And very dangerous. You're telling me! I had a fire aboard. Made a landing on Cayo Sal, off Venezuela. Man, was I in deep shit! Truth is, Juan Pablo Roque, we at Brothers to the Rescue need pilots like you. [signal beeping] [over radio in English] November 58 Bravo-Bravo to base. Cuban Coastguard spotted at 23-80 by 81-77 heading north/north-west. Bravo-Bravo to base. Cuban Coastguard spotted... [in Spanish] Cuban Coast Guard ahead. Change course. South-southeast. Varadero. [suspenseful music playing] Hey. -How did it go? -Things went wrong. -Nabbed by the Cubans? -[René] Mm-mm. They changed course. Their engine broke down off Varadero. U.S. Customs found them. Seized their weapons. Shit! Hope they don't talk. [René] Mm-hmm. No one must know we guided them. Your family stayed in Cuba? Yes. Life is tough there, as you know. Their connection to me doesn't make things easier. It complicates everything. For them, I'm a traitor. A gusano. Sure your wife still loves you? [René] I'm still in love with her. I can't live without that woman. And I think she misses me. So does my daughter. I want to believe that. What about you? You're a star here, you're on TV and all. [laughs] Dude, if I were a star, I wouldn't be on this bus with you. I'd be in a limousine. You know what? A paparazzi offered me 5,000 for pictures of me at the beach with girls in bikinis. What did you tell him? Nothing. I... I'm starting my life over, but not like that. [René] I get it. I'm marrying Ana Margarita. No way. Good going, brother. [reversing vehicle beeping] [indistinct conversations] [man] Olga. Olga. [Olga] How did it go? -[Olga] Did you eat well? -[Irma] Yes. [Roberto] A fight with her cousin. I bit him. Why did you bite him? I'm not saying. Go wash and straight to bed. Look at the time. Psst, hey! No goodnight kiss for Uncle? Come here. [sighs, kisses] See you tomorrow. Goodnight, Uncle Roberto. Goodnight, miss. There are bags of his clothes in the bedroom. [Roberto] I'll give some to our father. As long as you get rid of them. I want nothing of René's here. [Olga] Now tell me why you bit your cousin. We played Memory. I won all 10 rounds. [Irma] I told him I was the champ. Always bragging. He said I was the champ, but my father is a traitor. [sighs] You should have explained. Is it true Daddy's a traitor? My sweetheart, I've often told you why Daddy went abroad. To do business to help our country's economy. Fighting the U.S. embargo. That's not being a traitor. That's being a patriot. -[Olga] Come here. -[Irma sniffs] [Olga sighs] [kisses] [Olga] Look. They all say the same thing. I answered him once and he should consider himself lucky. [Roberto] What did you write? I still love him, but no way are Irma and I going to the United States. My daughter won't be raised by a traitor. Or live close to a terrorist, like José Basulto. [Roberto] I heard René left Basulto and joined the PUND. Better pay, supposedly. With them, you never know where the fight for a free Cuba ends and drug smuggling begins. Know where René will end up? In jail! And I won't care a bit. [engine roaring] [in English] Keep going south. South? It's not our flight plan. Did you follow the flight plan when you were working for the Hermanos? Not really. So keep heading south. [alert beeping] [men shouting] [co-pilot speaking Spanish] Hurry up! Faster! [co-pilot in English] Let's go! [indistinct shouting] [tires squeal] [tires squeal] [music intensifies] [men shouting] [car engine revs] [peels out] [in Spanish] You saw nothing. [in English] I saw nothing. Are you inspired today? -[Ana laughs] -Let me see. [laughing] Don't start. -I'm super inspired. -[Ana laughs] [doorbell rings] [Roque] Coño. René... -[René in Spanish] Hello, darling. -Hello. -[René] How are you? -Good. -Hope you're hungry. -Pretty hungry. -[in English] Will you get us some drinks? -Yeah, right away. -Gracias. -[Ana blows a kiss] [in Spanish] Speak Russian? [in Russian] I learned it in Cuba. Like you. Good. It's about the PUND. You know the rumor. They're just a front. Working with the Colombians. Smuggling cocaine. You said you didn't believe it. First, I didn't. Tequila. Mariquitas de platanos! -[Ana in Spanish] Like them? -Love them. She's some cook! [René] I bet. [laughing] Cheers! Hermano. [Ana] Salud. [in English] Ana, can you leave us alone for a sec? We need to talk. Yes. I'm sorry. [in Russian] I flew one of their loads myself. [inhales] I don't want to get arrested for drug smuggling. Roque-- I didn't come to the States to end up in jail. I told you. My cousin Denayf works for the FBI. He can put you in touch with his boss. [upbeat Latin music playing] [in Spanish] How are you? René Gonzales. Nice to meet you. [René clears his throat] What I need is an airtight case. [inhales slowly] So René... How far will you go for us? I won't take part in their criminal activities. [FBI agent] I'll cut to the chase. I'm offering you to be an FBI informer. [FBI agent] You'll get $1,500 a week. All I ask of you is to brief me on the PUND's activities. Informer. Not my thing. Your friend Juan Pablo Roque has been working for us for a year. -For the same money. -[René laughs] Now I get it. [FBI agent] Get what? His lifestyle. [Viamonte in English] I'll need you tomorrow. [René] For a special operation? [Viamonte] All operations are special. Landing in Honduras again? And then in Nassau. The money's good, but it's too risky for me. Got any other offers? Ramón Saul Sánchez reached out to me. Movimiento Democracia needs good pilots. Ramoncito? [in Spanish] Don't be a cocksucker. [in English] I told you, man. I'm working for the liberation of Cuba. And I'm trying to finance it. With drug money. I take the money where I can find it. [René] From Colombians. [Viamonte] How else do you think I can pay you 175 a week? [Viamonte] Can I count on you tomorrow? No. [tires squeal] -[agent 1] Get out! -[agent 2] Check in the back. [sirens] [agent] Turn around. [handcuffs click and fasten] [in Spanish] Tell me you're sure. You made up your mind. I'm no rat. Who says working for the FBI is being a rat? At least it pays well. I didn't sacrifice my life in Cuba to make money here. Life there is a disaster. No gas. Eight hours of electricity a day. No medicine. No food. People are starving. Let me ask you a question. Know how much Movimiento Democracia charges to bring people from Cuba to Florida? A lot. But it's for a good cause. My job... is to save lives. [Roque in English] Who's going to be there? [Roque] Okay. No, I can go. Is it good for you tomorrow? How you doing? I'm almost finished with the guest list for the reception. [sighs] Otherwise, I've got good news. You wanna know what it is? Of course I do. Luis Alexander is going to let us use the Alexander Mansion. The Alexander Mansion in South Miami! I know! That's really good news. -[Ana] Yes! And Jorge Mas Canosa will be there. Never met him. They're saying it's gonna be the wedding of the decade. [Ana] Can I ask you a question? Of course you can. Why do you have a cellphone? I don't know anyone else with one. My friends' husbands are happy with pagers. -It's useful. -Hmm? You can reach me whenever you want and I can call you-- I know how cellphones work. I got that. It's very expensive. -Not to mention the contract. -It's useful. You know, I am aware of how much things cost. -[Ana] You have a new Rolex. -Yeah, I do. It's a Rolex Submariner-- Silver with a blue dial. You're very observant. That costs $8000, at least. -You're not far off. -You bought it without telling me. I don't tell you everything. Where's the money coming from? I know that there are fewer balseros since the treaty with Cuba-- A lot fewer, yes. Fewer sorties. The Hermanos went from 2000 a year to 200-- and your donations to organizations that are helping them. -You are 100% right! -I know! That's why I'm asking... Where do you get your money? And I want a straight answer. I already told you. I signed a contract for an autobiography. Excuse me. The one you’ve been writing for six months? One hour a day max? -Yes, that's the one. -Really? That is bullshit! Who are you kidding? I've never heard of anyone making money from writing. Except you're a movie star and you make a biography-- Well, I am. I'm a star, my love. You're marrying a star. And the book that I'm writing for six months -one hour per day is gonna be dynamite... -[Ana] You're lying. 'cause I’m gonna tell everything about the low morale in Cuban aviation-- The only way you have of making that kind of money is with drugs. So I wanna know. What is it? Cocaine? [glass clinks on the table] Do you want me to leave you? Right now? Answer! Do you know how much this gold chain is? I didn't flee Cuba to be a loser in Miami, Ana. I'm wearing a $2000 suit. Does it bother you? [sternly] Does it bother you? I'm not involved in drugs. [whispering] But you don't know everything about me. And it's better for you that way. [René in Spanish] This is Charlie 4-0-4-7. This is Charlie 4-0-4-7. Blue Shark, do you copy? This is Blue Shark, copy. [René] Flying along 24th Parallel, 82W. The sea is clear. I repeat: Sea is clear. No Coast Guard. Let's go! Chino! [engine revs] -[gunshots] -[beachgoers screaming] -[alarm ringing] -[shooting draws nearer] -[people screaming] -[gunfire] [sinister music plays and fades out] [René sighs] Back from a mission? Don't you have your own sources? They say the operation was a success. No casualties. But damage. -Bad? -Bad enough. The Cubans won't shout it from rooftops, as you can imagine. The Movimiento may be proud. Not me. Why, if it's not indiscreet? I didn't join the resistance to abet terrorists. Just to save rafters. A beer? [Basulto murmurs indistinctly] [Basulto groans] Why did you want to see me? I got news from Olga. Damn! She's finally writing back? Yes. Her whole life is in Cuba. Her career, her friends, family. -It must be tough for her. -Yeah. [clears throat] But... she's made a decision. Really? She'll come and live with me. Okay, but... that's much easier said than done. I'm a U.S. citizen. And? The new law prioritizes U.S. citizens. It's not so simple. There are quotas, waiting lists, bureaucracy. Which is why I need your help. You have connections in Washington. Does she have a Cuban exit visa? No. No use pulling strings if they won't let her leave. [applause] [horns honking] [people cheering] [cameras clicking] [cheering and applause grow louder] [reporter speaking in Spanish] [whistling] [priest in Spanish] Bless and sanctify, Lord, the love uniting Juan Pablo and Ana Margarita. [Ana clears her throat] -[Ana laughs] -[whistles from the audience] [sighs] Juan Pablo, this ring is a symbol of my love and my loyalty. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. -May I? -[priest] You may kiss the bride. [organ playing the wedding march] [cheering and applause] [women cheering louder] [church bells tolling] [cameras clicking] [horns honking] [Latin music playing] [children playing] [chatter] -[glasses clinking] -[cheering] [in Spanish] Come, I'd like to introduce you to someone. [party noise faint in background] Juan Pablo, It is my honor to introduce you to the President of the CANF, Jorge Mas Canosa. This man will lead us to a free and democratic Cuba. An honor to have you here. A promise of success for our marriage. My friend, Basulto, says you're our best pilot. Available at any hour. Sir, with all due respect, from now on, you'll have to check with my wife about that. [all laughing] [door creaking] Congratulations. -Thank you. -Thank you for coming. [Roque clears his throat] [trumpet playing Latin music] -He's very handsome. -Thank you. [conversation fades into the background] [soulful Spanish vocals join music] Here's the groom. [cheering and whooping] [in Russian] I'm very happy for you. If only my wife were here. She'll come, trust me. [background laughter] Great crowd. Jorge Mas Canosa, no less! He rarely goes out in public. It's an honor. He wanted a picture with us. [laughs] He even called the press. [salsa music playing] [laughing] [women laughing] [indistinct in Spanish] [indistinct in Spanish] [in English] Come on! [groans] [Ana sighs] [waves crashing in distance] -[Roque] Ana. -[Ana] Oh, my God. -[wheel grinding] -[loud splashing] [in Spanish] Got the missing document? It arrived this morning. This morning! I asked for it 3 weeks ago. Now you can officially quit the tannery. Are you making the right decision? Yes, I am. We need you. And I know you like your job. What will you do in Miami? Start over from scratch? My daughter needs a father. I told you. [man] Yes, but that father? A traitor. Only one she has. So, you're sacrificing yourself. That's one way of looking at it. Thank you, Luis. [children talking] -Yanicé Rodríguez. -Here. Caridad de la Nuez. Not here? Olga Salanueva. You go to that desk. You come here. -You go there. -Hello. Comrade, I brought the document you requested last time. And my daughter, as you asked. Thank you. This will help your case. But it's not the right one. What? I need one from the Ministry of Light Industry. -You have it now. -No. This is from the Tannery Directorate. But the Directorate is part of the Ministry. Perhaps, but it's different. -I need-- -No one will ever believe me. Can I finish? [sighs] I'm sorry. I need a waiver from the Ministry releasing you from your contract and stating you have no debts with the State. I have no debts at all. So the document will be easy to get. [phone rings] Yes? I couldn't wait to tell you the good news. I found a job. For a cargo airline, Arrow Air. We can get by until you get a job. And if I pass my engineer exam, you won't even have to work. [René] You're not happy? [sighing] Listen, René... I went to the Ministry yesterday. It didn't go well. [door creaking] It's your father. Leave me alone. Another delay? [Olga] Even worse! I had all the documents but they invented a new one. I'm so discouraged. Please. Not now. We're getting so close. You know the real problem. The problem is you. Not the documents. It's you. [sighs] They'll never let me leave this country. [door creaks open] [ominous music playing softly] [man in Spanish] What's your name? Manuel Viramontez. Your parents? Pedro Viramontez and Rosalina Carrea. Place and date of birth? Cameron County, Texas. January 26, 1967. My parents returned to Puerto Rico in '70. Where they're from. I'm an American citizen. [officer] Your social security number? [in English] 584-56-5846. [officer in Spanish] Your address in Puerto Rico? Darlington Building on Boriqueña Avenue, 00925, Apartment 6C, Rio Piedras. [officer] Phone number? 658-1117. [officer] The building? A white building, eleven floors. [inhales] On the first floor there's a salsa station, Radio Voz... Very good, Lieutenant Hernandez. How long have you been with us? Six months... studying my role. Like an actor. -Better than many actors. -[all laugh] I see here that you joined a video rental club. Two glass doors. You had to knock to get in. $3 a film. Well, thank you. You're dismissed. Sir... So? His Puerto Rican accent is perfect. I think he's ready to move to Miami. To run the Wasp Network. [Latin music playing] -[waiter] If you please. -Thank you. Thank you. Let's toast. To what? [Hernández] First, we toast. Listen Adriana, my International Relations thesis was approved. So no more money problems? No more money problems. University pays for travel. Your travel? I'm going away. For several months. But... we said we'd have a child. [Hernández] We will. When I come back. When you come back. Of course. [woman crying] [crying gets louder] [sniffling] [sighing] [Adriana] I don't want to hurt you. -[Adriana] I'd hoped-- -For what? You'd finish your studies here, become a diplomat, as you always said. I will do that. No. You're going away. [sniffling] Adriana, what I'm telling you mustn't leave this room. For our love's sake, it must never leave this room. You have my word. Anti-Castroist groups in Miami want to choke Cuba's economy. It's why they're attacking our tourism industry. They want the world to think Cuba is dangerous. The only way to stop them is to infiltrate their organizations in Florida. And find out what they're planning. [Hernández] We already have men on the ground. They're waiting to be coordinated. They asked me to run this network. And I said yes. The Wasp Network. ["Wipe Out" playing] [narrator in English] René González arrives on December 8, 1990. Manuel Viramontez in December of 1991, and Juan Pablo Roque in February of 1992. The other agents arrive throughout 1992. First Linda and Nilo Hernández. Their cover: running a medical instruments export company to Cuba. Their mission: infiltrate Alpha 66, the most aggressive terrorist group. One, two, three... Antonio Guerrero moves to Key West, the base of anti-Castro radio stations. He starts out as a salsa teacher then gets hired as a lathe operator at the Boca Chica military airport. Ramón Labanino Salazar, black belt in karate, fakes his defection and joins the network in Tampa where his mission is to keep an eye on Luis Posada Carriles one of the most nefarious figures of anti-Castro terrorism. After four months of preparation, state security agents Amarylis Silverio and Joseph Santos ride the third wave of emigration to enter the United States. Amarylis quickly finds a job as a receptionist. Can I help you? Whereas Joseph has to make do with odd jobs. Others keep coming. By the end of 1992, the Wasp Network is fully operational. The agents have no contact whatsoever with one other. Only Labanino, González and Villareal are responsible for collecting information and passing it on to Manuel Viramontez. Each agent communicates via pager with his superior. [pager beeps] Every two weeks, the agent receives a message indicating a spot to deliver the information he has collected and saved to a diskette. Manuel Viramontez gathers the information, then transmits it to Cuba via shortwave radio. The files that were too large, he coded them, and mailed them to a P.O. box in Central America where a Cuban diplomat would pick them up and forward them via diplomatic pouch. During this period, the Wasp Network was able to thwart 20 terrorist attacks, and to seize a large quantity of explosives, weapons and cash. -[in Spanish] What's this? -[agent 2] C4! In March '95, Cuban Americans Martínez Rueda and Ramírez Oro entered Cuba clandestinely by sea to bury a load of explosives they would use in an attack on Hotel Melia in Varadero. A few weeks later, they flew back to execute their mission, and were arrested at José Martí Airport in La Havana. Both confessed to taking orders from CANF. Thanks to informations collected by the Wasp Network, 30 terrorists were arrested, both Cuban emigrants and mercenaries, targeting tourist destinations in Cuba. -[man in Spanish] Welcome. -Hello. [man] Have a seat. [Olga] Thank you. So... you're joining your husband in Miami. Yes, but I'm doing it for my daughter. So she's near her father. It's important that you know the truth. Your husband, René González, is not a traitor. Your husband is a hero. A hero? He sacrificed everything for our Revolution. His relationship with you, with your daughter. He is in Miami on a mission. To infiltrate terrorist organizations and warn us about their plans. He's helped save many lives. Now that you're joining him, you must know. But most important... [draws breath] your daughter must never find out. Never. Understand? Do I have your word? Yes. Truth is, I made the same choice as your husband. -[Olga] Mmm. -I'm in Miami too. I'm in contact with him, and now with you. I came back to tell you. It's important that you understand: your safety, your husband's, your daughter's, mine, everyone's safety depends on you and your silence. You can trust me. [with emotion] My God! All these years, I feel like... [gasps] Excuse me. All this... I need to take it in little by little, not all at once. [sighs] [groans] [door opens and closes] [in English] I had an X-ray. It's a sprain. -A bad one? -No, they say it'll heal in two weeks. I'm good. I feel good. [scoffs] Can I ask you something? -Sure. -Your closet is empty. Yes. The workers last week-- Juan Pablo, I can't see your eyes. Can you take your glasses off? -Mm-hmm. -With the workers last week, all my clothes were covered with dust, so I took it to the dry cleaners. I didn't want to bother you with it. That's very kind of you. -[sighs] -I have to get up early tomorrow. At three. At three? Yeah, I ferry a boat to Freeport. I'll be gone for the weekend. [scoffs] You have a bad arm. You still gonna go? [Roque, softly] Yes. What if I need to contact you? I'll keep my cellphone on. [mysterious tones playing] [Ana gasps] Remember? You're my bodyguard. [whispering] Yes. [softly] Your bodyguard. Like Kevin Costner. [both laugh] Look at me. [music intensifies] I will always protect you. [whispers] Always. [breathing heavily] [tires squealing] [in Spanish] Damn! Ever the star! [Hernández] I'll help you! [Hernández in English] Hey, sir! [in Spanish] How did you do that? I slipped in the shower. I'm sorry. And you can't fly? No... not with a brace. Hmm. We had to reorganize at the last minute. [slapping on backs] Don't miss the plane. [PA in English] All areas within the terminal building... [in Spanish] Your ticket to Havana. [mid-tempo rock music playing] [number dialing] [line ringing] -[operator] If you'd like to make a call-- -[slams phone] [slamming charger and drawers] [door slams open] [Ana gasps] -[phone lands with force] -[car door slams] [people shouting] [narrator in English] In the fall of 1995, more than 130 independent groups joined forces, calling themselves the Concilio Cubano. They announced three goals: a peaceful transition to democracy, amnesty for political prisoners, and participation by Cuban exiles in the transition to democracy. The reprisal was brutal. The Castro regime attacked Concilio Cubano with all of its strength. In February, they went all out. They ransacked homes. They attacked people. They imprisoned hundreds of human rights activists. People who didn't have weapons. People who only aspired to gather peacefully in La Havana. [man] Mr. Basulto! [cameras clicking] [reporter] Do you have anything to say about the situation in Cuba? Well, we don't have much information, but this is obviously the reaction of the government on its last legs, and proof of the strength of the democratic movement. For all Cubans craving freedom, the hour of truth has arrived. Today Hermano will drop flyers over Havana in support of the Concilio Cubano. [in Spanish] Give us our course, our direction... [all] Give us our course, our direction... and guide our planes to our brothers on the sea. [all] and guide our planes to our brothers on the sea. [Basulto] Good luck. Good luck, everyone. [applause] [moody music playing] [Basulto in English] Good afternoon, Havana Center. This is November 2-5-0-6, crossing the 24th Parallel. Today our area of operation will be the region north of Havana. [air traffic control] Good afternoon, November 2-5-0-6. Airspace to the north of the city is restricted airspace. If you cross the 24th Parallel, you're putting yourself in great danger. We know we are in danger each time we cross south of 24. But we are ready to do it. As free Cubans, we have the right to be here. [radio] Reporting hostile movement of Cuban fighter planes. Hello Riverdale. We have two planes ready for action, but superior orders forbid them from taking off. I repeat: we have express orders not to intervene. [radio in Spanish] Spirit of Miami, change your speed to 150. Here's Spirit of Miami. Changing to 150. [radio] 4-6-8 what is your altitude? 1,700 meters. Three planes in sight. Switch on your radars. Copy that. Target locked. It's a private plane. [jet zooms past] We've got company. Enemy MiGs flying around us. [radio] There's no risk. Just scare tactics! Permission to shoot. Now or never! Permission, dammit. -Authorized. -4-6-5, permission granted. [electronic tone] He vanished. [co-pilot] Sure he's not behind us? [missile blast] [explosive boom] [MiG pilot] Got him! Got the bastard! Seagull One? Hear from Spirit? Negative. See smoke on my left? [tense music playing] I see smoke! The two other Cessnas? Yes, still on course. [radio] Stay in the zone at a low speed. See the MiG? The MiG? Where the fuck is it? No... I see flames. Where are the flames? Damn it! Answer! Another plane ahead. Permission to shoot. Authorized. 4-6-5. Permission to fire. Where the fuck is the MiG? [missile blasts] [explosive boom] Son of a bitch! [MiG pilot] Destroyed! Our country or death! They're fucking shooting! [dials beeping] [sound of phone ringing fades in] [ringing continues] -[Ana gasps] -[phone rings again] -[in English] Hello? -[man in Spanish] Is Roque there? Hi René! No, he left for the weekend. He can't be reached. Is he with the Brothers? No, he broke his arm. He can't fly. Thank God! What's going on? Turn on your TV. [Basulto in English] Something very tragic that we have dreaded for a long time, I believe happened today. I believe we lost our first pilots. These small airplanes were unarmed, and clearly so. Cuban authorities knew that. The planes posed no credible threat to Cuba’s security. [in Spanish] I want to ask the world which self-respecting country would be willing to accept, on its own territory, the major violations perpetrated against ours... [thumping] [voices murmuring] [clattering] [all] Look! Look, there she is! Ms. Martínez! [knocking] ...circumstances of how you left Cuba and why you returned are rather murky. Sorry to ask you so bluntly, Mr. Roque, are you a spy for the Cuban government? I am not a State Security agent. I left Cuba for personal reasons, my divorce. But why did I decide to return? I returned because I became frustrated over there in the United States. I became frustrated with that society. I became frustrated with the political intolerance in the emigrant community. I wasn't happy with the life I was living. I was deceived by militants, claiming to be patriots, but who were in fact organizing terrorist actions in Cuba while pretending to give humanitarian aid. They were told many times not to violate Cuban airspace. Many times. And I said it to José Basulto. You can ask him. “Basulto, this is crazy, they’re gonna shoot down your planes." [reporter] Can I end this with a personal question? What will you miss most about your life in Miami? My Jeep Cherokee. [news theme plays] -[TV clicks off] -[remote clatters] [in Spanish] Come on, Irma! Don't be greedy! Little girl... you're not in Cuba anymore. You don't have to save food. My girl! [kisses] You're different. Very? [laughs] Yes. [both laughing] Welcome. -My girl. -[Irma] Dad. -[Olga] How are you? -Good. My child, do you remember me? I'm your great-grandmother, Teté. [laughing] You were a baby when I left Cuba. Look! This old lady is my sister Gladys. -[Irma] How are you? -[Gladys] Good, and you? -[Irma] Good. -[Gladys] Really good, no? [René sniffs] [René crying] [René sobs] Leave it. I'll do that. I'll say good night to Irma. You glad to be in Miami? I'm scared. Scared of what? I don't know. Of life. Life here? Everything's different. I know. Daddy's here. You have nothing to fear. Look. This photo of Fidel... Hide it. [Irma laughs] What is it? If you were really a traitor, you'd have torn it up. Sleep well. [Olga inhales deeply] [René] I have some friends who said they'd help us. They mentioned a job not far from here. In an old people's home. You'll have time to take care of Irma. It'll be hard to keep Irma out of this. Better to keep things as they are. You had no problem keeping me out of it. Will you forgive me? Truth is, I don't know. I understand you. And I, you. You did it for your country, for our Revolution. I respect that. I even admire you. But the cost was high. For us, for your family. I don't know if you realize what we went through. [gasps] For years I had a pain here that wouldn't go away. I feel the same way. It won't be easy to forget. It's not the life I wanted for my daughter and me. I'll make up for it-- You made a decision and we had to deal with it. Those wounds need time to heal. Remember how old Irma was when you left? -[René] Come on-- -She was 6. Olga, please... Don't remind me how old she was when I left Cuba. But remember it was your choice, not mine, not hers. I am here with you. In Miami. I never gave up on being your wife, not even in Cuba. Being the wife of a traitor there isn't easy. And I'm glad I made that choice. Why do you think I trained in radio transmission? And all that other stuff. So I can help you! To be on your side. But don't expect it to happen overnight. I need time. I need time, and so does our daughter. [sniffs] You have all the time in the world. As long as you give me reason to hope. [sighs, sniffs] -[Olga crying] -[René] Shh. [René] Don't worry. We're together again. [Olga continues to cry] [melancholic music playing] [René] Can I hope? -[Olga] Of course. -[radio static] [Olga] I've always loved you. Always. [in English] Please change Mr. Barbeito’s bed. He soiled it. Yes, ma'am. [mysterious flute music playing] [retches] [man] You have many aliases: Solo, Ramón Medina, Basilio, Lupo. How should I refer to you? I am Luis Posada Carriles. You can use my real name. Mr. Posada Carriles, how would you explain your relationship with the Cuban American National Foundation? Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman, is a dear friend. And how would you define that friendship? Uh, we both love deep sea fishing. And he buys my paintings. Your paintings? Yes, I paint traditional Cuban landscapes. It's how I make a living. These documents here, they show some recent very important transfers from the Cuban American National Foundation in New Jersey to a Salvadoran resident, Ramón Medina. Do you confirm that Ramón Medina is one of your aliases? Yes, I do. And you deny these payments are associated with terrorist activities? [laughs] Castro loves to blame me for everything. [Posada Carriles] Do you know what living in Cuba is like today? I do, I was there. It's communism. It's an economic failure. We are at war with communism. [in Spanish] Since Roque defected, Mas Canosa thinks there are more moles. It's become too dangerous for the CANF to plan attacks on Cuba. They don't want to put the U.S. in a jam. So they have to keep... [in English] a low profile. [both in Spanish] Thank you. [René] They need a new strategy. To step up their ops. Can we implicate Mas Canosa? No smoking gun. They're very cautious. And guess who's in charge. Luis Posada Carriles. Posada Carriles, that motherfucker. They're recruiting in Central America. Nicaragua, El Salvador. They want mercenaries. Guys who'd kill their moms for a buck. [man] You need money? [man 2] I'm good. So why you selling your car? It's my sister's. We live together. One car is enough. If you need anything, just call. [gunshots] You know, I have friends who'd pay a man like you, reliable and brave. I don't touch drugs. This isn't about drugs. It's about planting a bomb. What for? No questions. It's part of the deal. [gunshot] I'll answer you once and for all. In 1989, Cuba produced 8 million tons of cane sugar. Today... three million or less. Without tourism, their economy would plummet and the Castro regime would collapse. You have to hit where it hurts. Hotels, beaches. It's dangerous. 15,000 Colones per bomb. And legal fees in case of trouble. -Welcome to Cuba. -Thank you. [puffing air] [jazzy music playing] [voices murmur] [plastic bag rustling] [drops] -[birds chirp] -[chatter] [ominous music playing] [plastic bag rustling] [waves crashing] [phone ringing] [people talking] [ominous music intensifies] [rhythmic drum beats] Old Havana. [explosive echo] [in Italian] Sorry I'm late. My meeting just ended. We're enjoying our last day in Cuba. Tonight we'll be freezing in Toronto. Come, I booked a restaurant. [explosive boom] [people screaming] [crunching glass] [shouting and screaming continue] [explosion in distance] [in Spanish] What was that? Construction work at Hotel Panorama. Mind if I take off my T-shirt? [sirens wailing] Do as you please. Your pants too if you want. You're the customer. -Why are we stuck? -Roadblock. [siren] [bomber] Something happen? Must be Fidel going somewhere. [brakes whine] [motor approaching] They want us somewhere else! Let's go! [siren chirps] [salsa music playing] [retching] [bag drops] [sirens in distance] [eerie music playing] [sniffs] [sighing] [phone rings] [phone continues ringing] -Yes? -[man] Congratulations. The attacks made the press. I told you I don't care. I need money. I can't even afford a taxi. Your money is in Havana. An envelope at Hotel Capri. Wait here. I'll get the money. Raúl Ernesto Cruz León. That's my name. Nothing in that name, sir. An envelope? No, this is all I have. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -[grunting] -Don't try to resist! [squealing tires] [brakes screech] [engine revs] We saw you dumping this stuff in a trash can in Cervantes Park. Recognize it? No. [officer] The explosions at the Tritón and Chateau hotels left only minor injuries and material damage. But at the Copacabana, an Italian tourist had his throat slit by a metal shard. He's dead. If you cooperate... you may be able to save your ass. Otherwise... it's the firing squad. [explosive boom] [horn honks] [uptempo music playing] [in English] Excuse me. Thank you. [Hernández in Spanish] Hey, man. -Olga? -In the bathroom. So? You have news. Mas Canosa is very sick. -How sick? -He won't last the year. They have a plan to kill Fidel. It's in here. As always. Mas Canosa's last wish. [laughs] Last wish indeed. On Margarita Island, Venezuela. The Ibero-American Summit. -That's very soon, barely a month away. -[René] Yes. They have a boat, the Esperanza, leaving from Puerto Rico. [steps approaching] -[in English] Thank you. -[server] Okay. [in Spanish] Listen, let's pass this on to the FBI. -The FBI? -Yes. Catch the CANF red-handed and we score a major victory, man. Hello, Olga. -How are you? -Good. Let's toast. To what? Cruz León's arrest. Four bombs. One dead tourist. -You feel responsible? -Sure. We're here to stop that. We did what we can. We tracked them down, dismantled their organization. The recruiter is on the run now. But we have reasons to celebrate. Indeed. We have some good news for you. What's happening? I'm pregnant! -[René laughs] -[Hernández gasps] Yes. We waited to tell you until we were sure. Now we are. I had an ultrasound. Everything's fine. It's a girl. Congratulations! Great news. -[René] Thank you. -Got a name yet? -[René] Yes, Ivett. -[all] Ivett. -Pretty, isn't it? -Yes, very. Ivett... I like it. -How is Irma doing? -[René] Fine. She speaks fluent English. -Irma is jealous, of course. -Hmm. But she'll get over it. We all have to. Just watch out. I know, poor thing. But there's no other remedy but to learn she's not the center. [radio in English] Esperanza for Baranof. This is US Coast Guard Cutter Baranof. Please state your purpose in these waters. Esperanza to Baranof. We're tourists. We're on a fishing trip. [siren wailing] Final destination? Santa Lucia. [from cabin] Down here. [officer] Is this your fishing gear? Those weapons are mine. My passengers had no idea-- [officer] Anything you say may be held against you. They are to be used to kill Fidel Castro. And I am proud of it. [man] President Castro gave me a message to be delivered to President Clinton in person. The president will be informed. Cuban intelligence have been gathering overwhelming information for several years now. We keep a close eye on Cuban exile organizations. Then you know that the CANF is financing terrorists and that the operations are carried on by mercenaries recruited in Central America. Is Cuba willing to share its intel? I'm sure if you approach the Cuban authorities, they will respond positively. In front of you, you will find three files. The first, is the report on terrorist activities against Cuba since 1990. You will find proof that most operations led by other groups, were, in fact, commissioned by the CANF. In the second, you have a list of 40 Cuban exiles identified as active terrorists. And in the third, money wired by the CANF to terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, establishing his connection to CANF. Those are your conclusions? All the facts are here at your disposal. [in Spanish] You think the heads of the CANF will be affected by the Cuban intel given to the FBI? Well... Mas Canosa is not around anymore. He passed. He always said he didn't want to know of my activities. [sighs] I don't think the CANF will be upset. But the communist Cubans have a lot to worry about. Why would you say that? Do the math. Where does Cuban intel come from? A Cuban spy ring in Miami. [laughs] Honestly... [sighs] you think the FBI can tolerate such activities on American soil? I highly doubt it. [laughing] I highly doubt it. [phone rings] [Olga] Good afternoon. [in English] I'm Olga Salanueva from Ingles Ahora. We are offering to perfect your English in order to assimilate better into so-- [in Spanish] Fine. Yes, yes. Some other time. Sorry to bother you. Thank you very much. [man in English] Olga! Where are you going? To pick up my daughter at daycare. But it's not time to leave. I told you to figure something out. I know, but the school is far. I'm sorry. ["Western Union" playing] -[in Spanish] How's it going? -Great. -How about your exam? -9/10. [René] Hey, honey. Here on Friday? No Movimiento Democracia meeting? [René] It's next week instead. Great. [René] So I'm home. Enjoying a rest. [René] What about you? [Olga] Can you change her? I smell something off. Something off? What did you do? [Irma] I'll help. [René] That's why you're crying. [René shushes the baby] [René speaking softly] [René in English] ...proposed. Combined... [René and Irma speaking in Spanish] [Olga] Look at me! What? [Olga] Nice light. I want a picture. In my underwear? [Olga] Closer. I want the three of you. [all speaking in Spanish] Look at the camera! [Olga cooing] -[Olga cooing again] -[shutter clicks] [baby fussing] [baby cries] [crying grows louder] [baby whimpering] [helicopter in the distance] [helicopter draws closer] [helicopter very close] -[door crashes] -[footsteps] [agent in English] Move to the right! Pick up the left! [heavy thud] -[agent] Clear! -Show me your hands! On your knees! [agent 2] You're under arrest for spying on the United States of-- -[shouting] -[female agent] Come here! [agent 2] Get that kid out of here! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will... -[agent] Don't move! -[baby screaming] -Papa! -Calm down! Irma! Don't touch my daughter! [agent] You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot provide yourself with one, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights as I have read them? [in Spanish] Yes. [in Spanish] Olga, don't worry, my love. [baby wailing] [in English] Can I change my daughter's diaper? [agent] Someone will come with you. [fading sirens] Your husband is an agent in a Cuban spy ring. [agent] Not that I think that that surprises you very much. Nine other agents have been placed under arrest. We're here to ask you to collaborate with the United States government. [agent 2] Your baby was born in the United States. She's a citizen. This is not the case for you and your older daughter. You understand that you can be deported at any moment? I understand. I want to talk to my husband. [agent 1] I can't let you do that. [chains jingling] -[bell rings] -[bailiff] All rise. [bailiff] The Federal Court of Miami is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lenard presiding. The United States against Manuel Viramontez and associates. You are accused of conspiracy to commit espionage, acting as foreign agents not registered with the United States government, -falsifying documents... -Daddy! ...and perjury, filling out immigration forms. [gavel pounds] [in Spanish] Such bad manners. -What? -Nothing. Don't look. [squealing tires] [reporter] Excuse me, do you know any of the accused? [reporters questioning] [reporter] Can you answer my question? [melancholic music playing] [in Spanish] Amarylis, it's me Olga. Good and you? Imagine here! I need a favor. Can you get Ivett to daycare? You have no idea of the circus here. [man in English] Olga, can you follow me a moment please? Yes. Please, have a seat. [sighs] I guess you don't want to continue to employ the wife of a Cuban spy. Look, as far as I know, you haven't been convicted of anything. So for me, first and foremost, you're a mother that has two children to feed. I've had my own problems with the FBI. I know what scumbags those guys can be. So please, go back to work. [in Spanish] Please let me come. I'd love to. But you know you can't. And you must watch your sister. In this bag, milk, water and diapers. Tell Daddy I love him. Believe me, he'll be overjoyed. He sacrificed his family. Don't say that! Your father is brave, guilty only of fighting for his country. -How about us? -He does his duty. I wish he wasn't a soldier. I won't tell him that. I'll say his daughter is like him. Strong and courageous. Can I? Hey, can I? [kisses] [Olga] I'm getting by. I was able to keep my job. I'm glad. My boss is a good man. [laughs] Who'd have thought? [Olga inhales sharply] What? I'm trying to imagine your life in jail. I'm in a 6-by-12 foot cell. The only light comes from a horizontal slat. 20 inches long, 6 inches wide. High up and out of reach. That's my life. And the girls? How are they dealing with it? It's tough, especially for Irma. But we're okay. The FBI offered me a plea deal. What does that mean? Informing for a reduced sentence. And? Five of the others agreed to it. They'll speak? You won't cooperate, will you? You and the girls will be deported if I don't. [woman] Mr. President, as you know, 10 Cuban Americans, of Cuban origin, were arrested and accused of spying for your government. What can you say about this? What struck me, and we denounced it to the U.N., was how amazing it was that the biggest spy in the world... would accuse of espionage the most spied upon country in the world. Yes, we have sent Cuban citizens to infiltrate counter-revolutionary organizations. [Castro] In order to report back on activities of great interest to us. And I think we have the right to do so. As long as the U.S. tolerates the organization of sabotage, armed incursions, attacks of tourist facilities, smuggling weapons and explosives, and attacks on our economy, our tourism industry. All these things which we have denounced. [doors slamming] [metal detector beeping] [metal detector whining] [keys jangling] -[lock clicks open] -[buzzer sounds] [baby giggling] Little darling... [Irma] Give a kiss to Daddy, give him a kiss. -[René kisses glass] -[baby cooing] [René speaking indistinctly] -[Olga] Show him your duck. -[René] My love. [baby laughing] [René] Ducky fell again? Another kiss. [kisses] [kisses] [kisses] [baby babbling] She's a beauty. Prettier than her pictures. I brought you a package. They need to check it first. I'll get it later. Mostly food and books. It's your birthday, remember? [René sighs] I'm sorry Irma isn't here. She's safer in Cuba. I know. She's with her Granny, who takes good care of her. -You speak? -Every day. School's going well? Yes. And she asks about you every day. I can't talk to her yet. It's too painful. Tell her Daddy loves her. I tell her that every day. When things get better, we'll be together again. [sniffs] You know it won't be soon. You and Ivett will go to Cuba to join Irma. Then what? I won't cooperate. I just told my lawyer. I can't testify against my brothers. I just can't. [whispering] Even those who testify against you? No. Their morals aren't mine. Tell me if I have your support. Yes, you do. We'll be separated for a while. You know that. I won't let you go through this alone. I'll visit you as often as they let me. I'll always be there for you. And for our daughters. I promise. [baby fussing] Sure you won't stay? I have to go. We must be prepared. [Teté] I understand. When things clear up, I'll come back for her. And if they don't? Then she'll stay with you for a while. I know you'll tend to her as if you were her mother. Thank you. Teté. Look at her, so tiny. And so sweet. [crying] [Olga and baby babbling] Mama. -[kissing] -[baby giggling] [Olga] We'll see each other soon. Look at me. Look at Mommy. I love you. A little kiss. [screams] [Olga continues baby talking] [Olga crying] [Teté] Come with Grandma. [both] Bye! See you soon! I love you. -I adore you. -[Teté] Bye, Mommy! Thank you, Teté. I love you. -[Teté] Bye-bye, Mommy! -[baby cooing] -[Teté] See you soon. -[Olga sobbing] -[baby whimpering] -[Teté baby talking] [car door slams] [engine starts] [both] Mommy! [engine speeding off] [Teté speaking in Spanish] See you, Mommy! [both] Mommy. [man in English] Mrs. Salanueva? We need you to come with us. Calm down, ma'am. [handcuffs click] [helicopter engine] ["Asi te Amo" playing] [fades into a funky rock groove]
