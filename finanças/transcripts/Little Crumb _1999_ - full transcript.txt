Heavy, huh? If you give a tree to me, that barge will weigh a lot less. - What would you want a Christmas tree for? - To help you, of course. Well... A small one then. And thanks, hey. Don't mention it. Yippeeyayeah, yippeeyayooh. Hey, Kruimeltje. Come. Look, Mrs. Koster, surprise. I got it free and for nothing. - Give me your money. - My money? - The money you earned. - I didn't earn anything. And what did I tell you? You say so many things. Sometimes you chatter all day. Here I am polishing all day, and you're getting impudent. I told you not to come home before you made some money. Understood? - So what are you doing here? - Bringing you a Christmas tree. There is no place here for that tree. There is no Christmas for us. I curse the day I took you into my home. I said: That thing stays outside. - Chief, do you have a job for me? - Can't you read? - How old are you? - I'm 10, chief. - Are you putting me on? - No, I swear. - What's your name? - Kruimeltje. I will give you a penny for each broken window you find. A penny? It's a deal. - Do you have broken windows at home? - No. Do you have broken windows at home? - I couldn't find any. - Then you didn't do it smartly enough. Sometimes a window is broken... ...by naughty boys like you. Okay. That does it. Look over there. Little pest. Let me go. - I won't let you go. - I don't want to go to jail. Nobody will put you in jail. Calm down. I don't want to go to jail. - You! Come with me. - Not so rough. - Don't run away from me again. - He's only a child. This child is under arrest. What did he do? Stole the crown jewels? Robbed a bank? He broke windows. You can get further details at the police station. Broke windows... Let me out of here. That guy smells. So young and already gone to the dogs. Now someone else is telling you. Drunk people always tell the truth. Drunk people... ...and children. Yes, Van Houten, you smell. Kruimeltje? Not again? Keep him here, sir? - Hmm... Three nights. - Alright, commissioner. Are you never bored on the streets? No, never. What do you do then, all day? Look for work, for example. You didn't break those windows out of boredom, but you were looking for work. I want to know why you broke those windows, Kruimeltje. Yesterday it rained complaints about broken windows. Why did you do that? I'm sorry. I won't do it again. That Mrs. Koster, is she taking good care of you? Listen, just because you don't have a father and a mother... ...doesn't give you the right to be up to mischief all the time. I wanted to hold you here for three nights. Three nights? But somebody made me change my mind. I will let you go now... ...but next time I see you here, I will hold you longer. Are those special police dogs? Are you nuts? Those are stray dogs. They will be killed. In the dog pound. Murderers! I've come to collect my money. Oh, it's you? I thought I smelled something. Where is it? I'm waiting. - Then keep waiting. You'll get nothing. - A penny for each window. Seven pennies, because I broke seven windows. Nobody told you to break them. You were supposed to find them. You must be kidding. I did time in jail for that? - You got what you deserved. - You said: Break them. I would never say anything like that. And now beat it. I never want to see you again. You can choke on your pennies. Don't fool around with me. Holy chips, that wart is as big as a gooseberry. Well have I ever! You impudent brat. Can I help you? One pound of buttercake and twelve fruit pies. What do you want, boy. A wart bun. Err... I mean a currant bun, please. Three cents. Hey, you must pay for it. - Hey, outside you. Or I'll throw you out. - Ouch, please. I'm hungry. Currant buns are not for urchins. Let him keep the bun. I'll pay for it. Get out of here, little pest. He who picks up his bread from the gutter, bows to his food. Hey, Kruimeltje. Everyone gets a turn. I slide down and you can pull the sled up. Yeah, I'm not crazy. Let's get on it together. Well, alright I guess. Out of the way. Help. Move away! Out of the way. Oh, a copper. Watch out. Out of the way. No! Hey... Ho! What is this? What's going on here? Out. Oh... Quickly, hide there. Hey, officer, looking for those boys with the sled? Down there. Keesie, come. Let's go. Did you see the greengrocer look foolish? Yes, and that woman. Dear, we're having dinner soon. - I'm very hungry. Is dad home yet? - Yes, come. That fat neck with those two chins... Well, what are you doing here? - It's cold outside, so I thought... - Do you have money? - It's a long story. - Yes or no? I don't have one cent. What's in your pocket? Let me see. Yes, give it to me. I'd like those as well. - That's mine. - You are no good at all. Your mother was well aware of that, when she left you as a baby. Now you can stay; the bun is mine. And tomorrow you are out of here. Why don't you make that boy polish copper? With those little fingers he can reach every single spot. I tried. The little pest just makes my blood boil. You should just get rid of him. If I had known, I would never have taken him in. Doesn't he have a father anymore? Don't men only want one thing? Then the girl gets pregnant by accident, and they ditch her. - But you do like it, don't you? - I'm too old for this nonsense. - I'll close my eyes. - Not with the boy present. He's asleep. Here, money. - Pay for the copper and out. - Are you prudish all of a sudden?. Get out of here, you. Go away. Out of here. Let go, let go! - Little brat, what were you doing? - Not me, him. I'm starving. I don't get food until I make some money. - You have a stinking mother. - She's not my mother. Stepmother then. - Mothers are a pain. - Mine's not. I don't need a mother. How do I get some money? Jeepers, I know something. Hey, here with those papers. Newspaper. You can read about the murder in Keizer Street. Terrible fire in jailhouse. 300 thieves and murderers escape. People, close your doors and windows. Buy that paper. Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale! My share is for Mrs. Koster, and from your share we will buy candy. I have a bad feeling about this. They never should have lifted her upstairs. - She was unconscious. - Otherwise she would have screamed. Back broken in two places. There is no use operating. Is this your mother? Go away. Kruimeltje must come here. Here, Mrs. Koster. Don't cry, my boy. I don't deserve that. I haven't been taking much care of you. And now it's too late. I feel that my time has come. - No, Mrs. Koster. - Ssshh... I need to give you something. It's in the upper drawer of the dresser. Fetch it. Can you find it? It's in a little box. It belonged to your mother. Go ahead... ...open it. It's a small portrait... ...of your mother. I don't know much about her. She was young when she had you. Not married. A shame. And she couldn't take care of you. That is why she gave you away, and she brought you to me. The man next to her, on the other picture... ...is your father. - So, I do have a father. - Yes. I know nothing about your father. Except that your mother and he knew each other only for a short time... - ...and that he left for America. - America? To find gold. Men are stupid. Your mother had beautiful hands. I remember she told me that she played the piano. Her name is... ...Lize van Dien. - Lize van Dien? - Yes. That's her name. Remember that name. When you're old enough, you must try and find her. After all she's your mother. I don't want a mother. I want you. Oh, my child. Forgive me. Please. Forgive me. Is that all? Hers is bigger. It's unfair. She always gets a bigger one. I want more. Daddy gets two. I want two as well. Mummy, can I have two as well? We always eat the same. - Shut up. - Shut up yourself. Basta! There isn't anymore food. You should know how hard I have to work for this. Now eat. Where are you going? To my son. Then you're in the wrong place. This is America. America? America... - That boy can't stay here. - But he has nobody at all. That's a shame, but I have ten mouths to feed. An eleventh one is too much. It's almost Christmas. Where can he go? - Do you have no feelings? - For my own children, yes. The boy means nothing to me. He gets on my nerves. He has to leave. For Mrs. Koster. Hey, you. Get out with that animal. The church is not a shelter for vagabonds or stray dogs. Come on. Hop, out you go. Take that lousy dog away. I said, take that lousy dog away. - He ain't mine. - I don't care. And I don't ever want to see your face here again. Understood? What do you want? Do you want me to thank you? Okay, thanks for protecting me against that guy. That alright? Then you can go now. Bye. What is it you want now? Go away. Go to your master. Or don't you have one? - Wow, that one is big. - Yes son, he must be over three feet. - What's that? - A shark. You must have guts. All of you against one dog. Get lost. It's only a stray dog. That doesn't mean you have to beat him. You want to go to jail for three nights again? - I've only been in for one night. - Thanks to me. They wanted to keep you for three nights. I had to talk the hind legs off a donkey. - I don't know you at all. - I know you. Your name is Kruimeltje. You have no parents. You live on the streets. - What's your stepmother's name again? - Mrs. Koster. But she's dead. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm Chris Wilkes. - Are you a copper? - No. You ran past my store when you were breaking windows. I looked into your file at the police station. It's rather large. - Is that your dog? - No, but he's following me. Come inside. I'll get you something to eat. Don't touch. I want it to remain in one piece. I'm not touching anything. Then it's okay. - Do you like it? - Yes. Pretty well done. Made by an old friend of mine. The best one I ever had. There's a lot of work in it. He's very black. Just like a Moor. Hey, I'm going to call him Moor. Moor! Here, put this on and there is the broom. Let's make this deal: You can sleep here and you'll get good food. In exchange you'll help in the store and you'll deliver some groceries. - Well, hundreds of groceries. - Go sweep the floor. Hey, Kruimeltje. Why did you leave all of a sudden? I couldn't sleep next to your smelly feet. - You're not coming anymore? - No, I've got a new friend. - Come with me. - I don't want to. Hurry up. I want to go home. My father is there too, in the Wild West. In America. Yes, and mine is in China. Really, my dad is with the Indians. I swear. Yeah, sure... Look, this is my father. Mrs. Koster gave it to me. - Quite a guy. And the other picture? - Nothing. - Yes there is. You're hiding something. - I'm not. - You're keeping your thumb on it. - I'm not. Oh well, better a father in a locket than no father at all. - Where are you coming from this late? - Late? Is it late? What are you doing? I'm writing. Listen, if you want to stay here and be my friend... ...some things have to change. - Are you writing with a machine? - This is a typewriter. I push the characters here and then they are printed on the paper. What are you writing? A book. I'm trying to write a book. It's my deepest wish, writing. Being a writer. What are you writing about? About the mischief I got up to when I was a young boy. Together with my friend, Harry. He was a very special person. A friend through thick and thin. Is he the one who made the boat? That's him, yes. I often look at that ship and then I think of him. I miss him. Has he left? - He went to America. - So did my father. He went to America too. Listen, daydreaming is okay, but the reality is that you don't have a father. - He went searching for gold. - So did Harry. I'll show you his picture. Look. Hey? He looks quite a lot like my father. Only a little bigger. I understand that you wish that a guy like he would be your father. I bet you also fantasize about a sweet, nice mother. Look for yourself. But that's impossible. This is Harry Volker, my friend. He's in America. Where did you get this? Mrs. Koster gave it to me. Just before she died. She said those people were my father and mother. Well, I'll be damned, boy. Then you must be... Then you are Harry Volker's son. Why didn't you say so before? I didn't know his name. - Do you know your mother's name? - Yes. Lize van Dien. I can try to track her down. I don't want to meet her. She left me when I was a baby. You'd better search for my father. Yes, but he is in America. - I thought he was your friend? - Yes. - But I never heard from him again. - Why not? There was a war going on. Lots of people lost each other. Or died. Or passed away, yes. Hey, Wilkes. If my father weren't in America, but in Holland... ...then it could happen that I could run into him, couldn't it? Of course. The son of Harry Volker... Wilkes! Wilkes! Wake up. Come, we must get outside. We must go through it. Come. Call the fire-brigade. Moor is still inside. Kruimeltje, stay here. Are you out of your mind? Wilkes, wake up. Don't die. Wake up. Don't die, wake up. Step aside for the fire-brigade. Step aside. People, aside. Make room. You are a serious customer, aren't you? I don't have time for naughty boys. How much is a ticket? - Return trip or single? - To America. - To America and back? - I don't need to get back. Second or third class? I'm not going to school. Well, if you did, you would have understood me. Second or third class for the trip. There's a difference in price. Is there a first class too? There is, but your father can't afford that. My father is in America. I'm going to search for him. I see. Children under 16 years are not allowed to travel alone. I'm not going alone. I'm going with my dog. That's the same. - What's the same? - That's the same as travelling alone. - With my dog is the same as alone? - Yes. Because your dog cannot come. Animals are not allowed. Hurry up, there's a queue behind you. Tell me how much it is. The cheapest ticket. A single costs 300 guilders. But there's a new law. You can only come if you have a visa. Are you feeling better, Wilkes? Oh yes, a whole lot better. But I am worried about you, Kruimeltje. You don't need to be. I'm having fun with Moor. And we eat a whole lot. How do you get that food? Oh, people give it to us. We get something to eat everywhere. Where do you sleep at night? In the steam pumping station. Well, it's not very quiet. Tonight is Christmas Eve. Tomorrow it's Christmas. Where will you be then, Kruimeltje? Mrs. Koster always said there was no Christmas for us. My God, boy. You need a home. A father who takes care of you. Hey, I've been thinking. When they let me out of here... ...I plan to go and search for your father in America. You would do that? That would really be the nicest Christmas present. I don't know how much a trip like that costs. Very, very much. And you need some V's. Some V's? Who gave you that idea? And I don't know about the insurance. Better go. He's still weak and shouldn't tire himself. See you tomorrow, Wilkes. Sweet Moor. There is a baby born on earth Who came to earth for us all. Hey, you there! Are you here again? The church is no place for scumbags. - And certainly not for animals. - There is a cow and a donkey. Those are fake. And now out you go, little brat. - The impudence. - Jesus was the son of a carpenter. Jesus was the son of God. And you, ouside, hurry up. Out. And now get lost. I don't want to see you here again. Understand? Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright. Peace on earth, and good will toward men. That is the true meaning of Christmas, dear faithful friends. Peace on earth, and love thy neighbour. And the child in the crib makes that clear to us. Hey little boy, wake up. Wake up, boy. Merry Christmas, boy. What a way to celebrate Christmas. I would like to keep you here for a while... ...but I am afraid that we have to come up with something else. You understand that you have to stay somewhere now Mrs. Koster is dead, do you? Wow, you are tall and skinny. I think I'll call you Nail. Rusty Nail, because you cannot laugh. - We've come to see the governor. - Dogs are not allowed inside. - Then let's leave. - Let's talk to the man first. Come in. My name is Keyzer. The boys call me 'father'. This is Mrs. Keyzer, 'mother'. That makes it a little more homelike. Children should remain standing. What's the name of the boy? - Kruimeltje. - Kruimeltje? Everyone knows him by that name. My name is Harry Volker. My father is in America and I will go look for him there. And I don't want to be in an institution. He has a rich imagination. - Children don't speak here. - I will just run away again. Shut your mouth! Where do you live? Didn't you hear me? I asked where you are living. - You told me to shut my mouth? - Answer! Where do you live? Everywhere and nowhere. What kind of impudence is that? Please ask me the questions and don't argue with that child? Then we will get somewehere. - Can Moor stay here? - Who is Moor? - My dog. - We'll find a solution for that. Are you coming to the dining room? We are about to start a Christmas dinner. Leave the dog here for now. He will have to learn that sometimes life asks for sacrifices. Yes. And too many in some cases. Boys, this is Harry Volker. He's coming to live with us. Sit down over there, next to Long Jasper. Hey. You all wait until I give it to you. - But he's taking it himself? - You all wait. Plate. Did you ever hear a steam pumping engine? - What? - That makes less noise than you. You eat like a hippo. Belly is called a hippo. Belly? Is his name Belly? My name is Daan. What's there to laugh about? I said that Belly eats like a hippo... ...and makes more noise than a steam pumping engine. We don't tolerate that kind of language here. If you say anything like that again, I'll send you upstairs without food. Hey, where is my dog? Hey father. I'm not your child. And yet you must call me father. Hey father, where is my dog? Well, where is he? Hey father! Hey... Hey... Hey... Father... Where is my dog? Outside. Can't we play outside? No, we can't. Everything is locked here. I want my dog. Where is he? Where do you think he is? Do you think they took him away? What a lousy trick. I must get out of here. Hey! You'll get yelled at. Now you go and find your dog. Hey Nail, thanks. Bye, Harry. Everyone calls me Kruimeltje. Kruimeltje. What do you want at that gate? Why don't you go home? - It's Christmas Day. - I don't know where to go. A little vagabond? Like the dogs here? - Do you have dogs here? - Of course. I've plenty of them. Why do you think I'm carrying these buckets? I'm going to feed them. Christmas Day, alone? You can help me if you want. I have a Christmas tree. That is A. That's where the dogs go that have just been brought in. They stay there for a day. The second day I take them to B. The last day, the last day they go to C. That's why I feed those first. These are the poorest things. If they aren't claimed by tomorrow, they'll go to the gas chamber. The gas chamber? This is the gas chamber. We take the dogs in this way. Big dogs two, small dogs three. The gas tap opens, they go to sleep and they never wake up again. - Does it hurt them? - What gives you that idea? - Dogs have no notion. - It's the same as murder. If a dog doesn't have an owner, he'll start roaming about. He'll have vermin, and so will the children. That's bad for society. So the authoroties say: Get rid of those mutts. Calm down a little. These have been brought in today. Do these dogs always bark so much? There's always a couple with big mouths. The same as people. I couldn't sleep with that noise. You'll get used to it. I sleep through anything. My wife snores like a saw-mill. And if they all bark at the same time? That never happens. Here, Moor. Another one. Hey, there's no bird in there. The bird is dead. How come? Meoow. - Where's your cat? - Woof! Are you comfortable? You can help me bury tomorrow. Bury? Three of them will be killed tomorrow. Oh well... That's the hardest job there is. Burying those creatures. Good night. Say, you don't snore, do you? I was just thinking. Here. Now run! Run, run! Damn it. Come back! Yippeeyayeah, yippeeyayooh! I'm going to call the police. Wilkes, Wilkes. Are you asleep? Gosh, Kruimeltje. It's good to see you again. I was expecting you yesterday. Where were you? Well, you know, I was invited by such nice people. They had so many things to eat, and a Christmas tree that big. And a nice bone for Moor. And who were those people? Well, I know them from before. Friends of Mrs. Koster. - It's nice to have good friends, huh? - Yes, Wilkes. The doctor said that I'm much better now. Really? I can leave the hospital before New Year's Eve. I can hold out until then. Moor, come. Come on. Hey, filthy thief! Dirty little pest! That little pest stole my bones. Wow, that's a beautiful lady. Who is she? She's an Italian lady. One Vera di Borboni. A famous pianist. But that's all I know. Moor, there. Go. Look, Moor. Vera de Bonbon is very famous because she plays the piano. If Vera de Bonbon had a baby, she would never desert him. She would be a good mother. You can see that easily. Wilkes! Are you okay? I'm happy you came. We're going to bring some structure into your life. We'll look for a room. We'll teach you some manners and then you'll go to school. What are you doing on the streets? You should be in the institution. Institution? The dog pound guard filed a complaint against you. Wait. I'm sure there must be some misunderstanding. I listened to you before, but the boy only means problems. Homeless boys are not good for society. Build a place to gas them. Just like the place where you took Moor. I'm not going to the institution. I'd rather sleep 100 nights outside than one night in that creepy place. I'll come along to explain. Hey, why don't you come here? As long as you don't take me to the institution. Don't be afraid of that, and come here. - You're coming home with me. - Which home? The one we'll find together. Well, it looks neat, doesn't it? Nice! Come, Moor. New year's cakes. To the New Year, Kruimeltje. Who's there? Yes? You stay here. Go inside! - Does Mrs. Koster live here? - Never heard of her. It's just me living here. Don't whine. I can't hear myself talk anymore. The former resident died. Was she Mrs. Koster? And the little boy? Little boy? No idea. I have my own children to look after. Shut up for a minute! It was a long day yesterday. Try the neighbours perhaps? Sir, do you know if there was a little boy, who lived here? Hundreds of boys lived here. Harry, Harry van Dien? With Mrs. Koster? Never heard of him. And Mrs. Koster is dead. Driver, I want to leave here. - I don't want you to wait for me. - I want to wait, I want to come. Be still. You've only known me for three weeks. I'm just a poor guy. I've nothing to offer you. You deserve better. I love you. I'm sorry. Well... no? Yes, that one is nice. Remember, you're Harry Volker, and you mind your language. Good morning. I am Mr. Ledaire. Who are you? - Harry Volker. - Well alright. So you are Harry Volker. And how do you like it here? - Good. - Be polite. Good and what? Very good. Huh? They look like headlights. Excuse me? Your specs. Your glasses, Kruimeltje. Err... Harry. I'm sorry. - You should say: Good, sir. - Good, sir. Exactly. That's a lot better already. Let me see. You can sit over there. Alright, attention. We continue. A... B... C... Very good. I thought you couldn't read. I know those letters from the dog pound. Mean people. They kill dogs because they live on the streets. - Hey, do you like dogs? - Listen, Harry. When I ask a question, you give me an answer. No more. And you don't say 'hey' to a teacher, but: - You! - No, my friend, you say 'sir'. Got it, dude. Dude? What kind of nonsense is that? Say: I understand, sir. Alright, chap. Say: I understand, master. Or you can stand in the corner. Understand or you can stand in the corner. Just continue, yes. Well? - Are you making fun of me? - I wouldn't dare, Sir Red-hair. The name is Ledaire and not Red-hair. And there will be no laughing about that. - Heya, Wilkes. - Hello, boy. Are we going to search for my father? I could only afford one trip. I'll wait here for you. With Moor. I'm afraid that is impossible. You cannot stay here. - Will you write about your trip? - I will tell you all about it. Will you promise me that you will try to keep up? - Bite the bullet and carry on. - I promise. Will you return safely? I'd rather have no father, than have to lose you. Your father is a better guy than I am. Just by being your father. Keep your pecker up, kid. Thanks for your help with the visa. I assure you this boy deserves it. Good luck, Wilkes. Alright, that dog can stay in the barn. But mind you, don't bring that dirty mutt in the house... ...or you'll pay for it. Ah, nice bed. Come, Moor. Well, are you here again, boy? Nice that you are back. Go and sit where you were before. - Hands off. - Who says so? - I do, you've heard it, Are you deaf? - Mind your own business. Just wait for your turn. Let us pray. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those that sin against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Amen. He knows tricks too. Moor, look. Nice, nice. Come, Moor. Very good. Dead. Dead. Dead. I hear something. Somebody is coming. I really thought that I heard somebody. Harry, you do know that the dog is not allowed inside. - If father sees it, you're in trouble. - He doesn't hurt a fly. You cannot have a dog in your bed. I'll let him sleep on the floor. Tomorrow he goes back. As long as you don't tell Keyzer. Well, only this once. Harry Volker, come here immediately. You have no manners... ...no discipline... ...and you're disobedient! You brought the dog in the house when I had forbidden it. You even let him sleep in your bed. Under the bed. Father. Say it. Say father to me. You're the worst kind of rat... ...that needs to be exterminated as soon as possible. I'll put you in your place. I'll beat that impudence out of you. Unbutton your shirt. I fed Moor. - Thanks. - A large slice of sausage. Try to sleep. In a week you will be able to lie down on your back. We know how you feel. He beats us all. - I didn't do it. - What? - I didn't call him father. - Good for you. A man like Keyzer doesn't deserve that. No. You're not so bad. Wait, I'll teach you a song. I don't want you to teach me. You snitched about Moor. Do you really think I did that? Be smart. Look around you. - Was it Belly? - I already told you: I am not a traitor. - Someone told me it was you. - What? That you told them about Moor. - Just what you deserved. - Dirty traitor. If you ever do that again, I'll beat you up so... ...that your belly is on the other side. Two letters. For you and for Harry. Will you give it to him? I've got a letter. From my dad. Dear Daan. How are you, my son? I hope they feed you well. I told Mr. Keyzer to take extra good care of you... ...so that you will grow up to be a healthy Dutch boy. With me and your mother everything is fine, thanks to the nice weather. Greetings from your father and until next time. Bite the bullet and carry on. See Harry, we're going to learn musical notes. C, D, E, F, G. Now a little further. A, B, C. C, D, E, F, G. No. See, with this finger, like this. - A, B, C. D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Wow, you learn fast. What you have learned in two months. Try the next piece. Look. Ha, that one is mine. From my father. You never get mail, do you? Or did you think there was someting here? Here, see for yourself. The lid is closed. I'm not allowed to teach you any more. The father said so. You are the only one here who is sensible. Money has been stolen. From the drawer in my office. He who did it can now step forward and make himself known. Well... ...is anything going to happen? Or do I have to beat it out? Who stole that money? I really didn't do it, in case you think so. No? Why not? Nothing has been stolen here before. You were the last one to arrive here. But you don't have to say anything. I'll find out. Huh? What do I find here? A guilder. A guilder. I didn't do it. Pick it up. I have to take you to the police station. Wilkes will be very disappointed when he hears how you misbehaved. He has always protected you. He told me to see the difference: Criminal behaviour or monkey tricks. Well. How would you call this yourself, Kruimeltje? A monkey trick? I didn't do it. Go fetch your dog. Then we can leave. I promised Wilkes, Moor. But we can't stay here. - I didn't do it. - I know. Come, I'll help you. Climb up. You must hurry. Why aren't you coming? - Anywhere is better than here. - I'm staying. Come. Now you sit down. You can't trust grown-ups, Moor. Not my father, not my mother. Not the commissioner. Not Father Keyzer. Not even Wilkes. Come, Moor. Come. Yippeeyayeah, yippeeyayooh. - When do you need the grand piano? - As soon as possible. I live here and I need to practice. This is not a toy store. And dogs can definitely can not come in. Leave him. Never discourage a child who is interested in music. Shall we play together? - Not bad. Who taught you to play? - My mother. - Can you read notes? - Yes. C, D, E, F, G, A, B. They must be very proud of you. What's your name? - Kruimeltje. - Kruimeltje. Never heard that before. I have to go now. It was a pleasure meeting you, Kruimeltje. Shall I lead the way? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - If you ever want to buy a piano... - I know where to find you. Come, Moor. You, show me your ticket. - I don't have one. - Then come with me. Next time, buy a ticket. Vera di Borboni? Kruimeltje. How nice to see you here. - You want to go inside? - I don't have any money. That doesn't matter. Tonight you are my guest. He has a severe concussion. He will probably throw up. He must definitely remain in bed in a dark room. - We will see to that. - Goodnight. This is impossible. This is a joke. Kruimeltje. You're here. With me. - You play very well, miss. - Thank you. You realize that the course lasts four years? Yes, sir. Music means a lot to me. - What's your name? - My name is... Vera. Vera... ...di Borboni. Lize van Dien. Moor, old boy. Where the heck did we end up this time? I see the young gentleman is feeling a lot better today. I'll inform madam straight away. And stay in bed, little chap. Doctor's orders. We've ended up in another country. I don't understand one word they say. My boy, I'm so happy that you are feeling a little better. You had a staggering blow from the accident. You slept for six days. What's wrong? Do you still feel sick after all? You ate something, I see. I didn't. My dog did. He's the only friend I have. Besides Nail, and Wilkes. But he is in America. Searching for my father. They call me Kruimeltje, but my name is Harry Volker, just like my father. My father fought against indians and crooks. He went searching for gold, but they stole it from him. And now he takes revenge with pistols. Then he shoots them. How do you know all that? That's the way it is in the Wild West. I saw it in the moviehouse. My father is a hero. - And your mother? - My mother, I hate her. She didn't want me, now I don't want her. Tell me everything about Wilkes. How did you end up with him? If you see Wilkes or speak to him, ask him to contact me. Madam... Where did you get those? Nail says hello. He found these letters in Belly's locker. Letters? From Wilkes! Wilkes is coming back. He writes that he will arrive on August 15. But that's tomorrow. - He asks me to come and meet him. - Does he write about your father? Yes... That he couldn't find him. Now I will never have a father or a mother. Never. I will go and live with Wilkes. What do you know about your mother, other than that she left you behind? Only that she was very young. And that she wasn't married, because she was such a nasty woman. A lot of people don't deserve a son like you. He was lucky to leave for America just in time. And your mother remained behind alone. Can you understand that if an unmarried woman has a baby... ...that this is not accepted in our society. She cannot lead a normal life. She would be an outcast. For men it makes no difference, but a woman will be condemned. - That is not fair. - That certainly isn't fair. If there is something then, that you want to achieve badly... ...that's an urge that is inside you, like music in your heart. And when you are young, and have no money... ...then there is no way out as a single mother. I believe my mother could play a little piano. - Like me? - Not as good as you, of course. - Hey, we're here. - Kruimeltje, I... Kruimeltje! Wilkes, Wilkes. Here I am. I'll be damned, Moor. My father! Look here. - A good idea to bring your mother. - My mother? Wilkes, come. Let me introduce. Lize van Dien. Come and sit with us. Say Wilkes, tell me why. Why didn't you write that you found my father? - Because I hadn't found him then. - Huh? But you were coming home. How is that possible? Wilkes, you tell him. Alright. You must know that I did a lot of travelling through America. I searched everywhere, but nobody knew where your father was. Every lead was a dead end. Very frustrating. I didn't like it at all when my visa expired and I had to return. Unbelievable. Not Dutch. That is what he said. I don't know why I still went to that marina. Because I had nothing else to do? Maybe I was just curious. Wilkes. Harry Volker. Chris Wilkes. - Is that ship yours? - The whole marina is mine. - I noticed you called it Lize. - Yes, Lize. That little ship was the clue. I never told anybody that I was from Holland. It's a miracle that I am here now. With you... With the two of you. Hey, Kruimeltje! Keesie! Well have I ever... That's your father. Nice gift. Oh, what a beautiful car. A fire engine. I've always wanted one. Thanks! Sorry that I am this late. I'm glad you already started. Commissioner, here you are. I'm giving everybody the same... ...but Kruimeltje can unwrap his present first. - Here you are, boys. - Have a seat. Guess what... Wilkes wrote a book! You shouldn't have written about me. Who wants to read that? I don't care, Kruimeltje. I wanted to write it. Who wants to read it, that is another tale. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - You did it. - Am I not the bad guy? - Read it, I would say. - Nobody will ever want this book. Get out. Give me a currant bun, the little boy begged. The angry baker rushed towards him...
