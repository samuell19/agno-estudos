I know it sounds simple, but you gotta stay alert, - Rocky? - Yeah, okay, Jerry. You hit cross street traffic both directions in the alley behind me. - You got your piece on ya? - Yeah, I got it. Good. Yeah, you do a good job, we'll get you a suit that fits. - Okay, pack her up. - Okay. I know there's a war going on, but I got a big problem right here, Ange. I mean, I been paying for a lot of years, I think I'm entitled to a little consideration. I mean, I don't ask for a lot, right? Just a few inspection things... All right, and that thing with my friggin' wife. You know what, Mario? How about every time I see you, there's some new thing. What are we saying here? That I ain't got a right to voice a concern? I mean, all right, I know I got a big mouth, I know, I mean, if I think it, I gotta say it. All right. Granted. But, this-- This here thing is important, what I'm talking about. I mean, I'm getting myself into a real situation here. Situation. This guy opened up a place over on Reed Street, What kind of place? You know, coffee, espresso, the whole thing, right? So I went in there the other day, took a look around, you know, on the QT. Ange. It's very close, you know what I'm sayin'? This guy's doing a lot of the same stuff as me. Like what? You know, w-w-with the cakes, with the sandwiches. And you know what else? With the iced coffee, he's doing the sweetened ice cubes. Doing the sweetened ice cubes? You believe this shit? Fuckin' tragedy. Hey, that's like a trademark thing for me. I mean, I don't know, normally, I welcome a little competition, but this... I don't know, I mean, this fucking guy, he's got new floors, air conditioning... I can't air condition this place, the wiring won't take it. What's the point, Mario? You know, I... I think this guy should have a little trouble, is what I think I'm sayin' here. Little trouble? It's getting late, Ange. We'll run it by him. I put myself in your hands. Well, I'll run it past my pop. We'll see. That's good enough for me. All right, thanks. Appreciate it. Hey, don't worry. Noonsie, that's with me. Believe this hard-on? We're out there fighting for our lives, this SOB wants us to mess somebody up 'cause he don't wanna pay an electrician. You don't pop some guy because he put in an air conditioner. It ain't that simple, it ain't a black and white thing. That's exactly what it is. How do you figure? It's a clear case, there's a line. You don't cross the line. What line? Hey. Happy birthday. What? It's your birthday, you forget? What the...? You didn't have to get me a gift. I handed it to you, it's yours. Man. You like it? What's not to like? It's beautiful, I love it! That's good, 'cause it set me back large. You paid for this? Are you trying to hurt me, Ange? You think I'm going to get you a hot watch for your birthday? Yes. Yes, I think you would. Hey, you got a point, you prick, you. Hey, Johnny. Hey. Hey, look at that face. Is that beautiful or what? Yeah, it's a beautiful face. Ange, can I show you something? Sure, babe, what do you got? Santino, come here. Come here. Tell 'em what happened. Okay, so this guy comes in, right? And he says, "You got French cigarettes?' So I says, "Yeah." And he hits him in the eye. What? And then-- And then, he says, "You still got 'em?" And he hits him again, - then he walks out. - French cigarettes? - When did this happen? - Couple of weeks ago. Couple of weeks, and he looks like that? What did he hit him with, a Buick? He's got fine skin, he bruises a lot. Well, who did it? You know that guy, that... Charlie Flynn. Him? Jesus. All right, leave it to me, I'll take care of it. Johnny, next time something like this happens, let me know a little sooner, okay? - You see how this works? - I've been looking for an excuse to clobber this son of a bitch for months, now the dumb fuck hands it to me on a platter. I'm telling you, you live right, this kind of shit just happens. What the hell? Hey, no, no, no. Man! - Bullshit! Put the car down. - Say again? Put it down! What the fuck you talkin' about? I'm gonna cut you a break. What's your name? Dave. Dave? Nice name. All right, Dave, news flash, you're not towing this car. No? No, and I'll tell you why. It belongs to Angelo Martinelli. So what? So what? You ever read a paper in your fucking life, Dave? Martinelli. Ring a bell? This car parks here every day, and it never gets towed, capisce? I hook on, the car goes. You get here before I hook on-- You're not listening to me! You ain't towing his fucking car. Put it down now, now! Hey, are you threatening me? Yes, I'm threatening you. You don't put this car down, I'm going to hit you so hard, your mother's womb is going to ache for a month. You got a lot of fucking nerve, man. I work for the city. I don't gotta take this shit. You're seconds from a beatin', pally! Did it occur to you, you might do better with people if you didn't yell, and scream and threaten them? What are you, Mahatma Gandhi here? People like to be treated like human beings. You wanted to be treated like a human being? That's right. Is that what you're sayin'? Yeah! Just a second. He wants a bribe. How much? I don't know, probably 50. Hey, Mahatma, 50 good for you? Now he's embarrassed. Jesus! He wants more. Hundred. Guy thinks he's John Dillinger. You want me to smack him, Ange? Say the word, baby, I will kick this fucker's balls up to his esophagus. He's just doing his job. Taking bribes is his job? He works for the city. Piece of shit cost me 15 minutes of my life. Plus, I think I sweat through this shirt. Dellarosa's gonna have a heart attack we're running so late. What is that? It's Pops conditions for the troops. Yeah, as bad as last week? It's fucking crazy! This guy ain't gonna go for this. I don't know why we're bothering to take this to the table. Pop wants him to give up all hijacking of trucks on the west side. What's that leave him? Exactly. That's what he was fighting for. Well, that's what I'm saying. This kind of stuff makes my neck hurt. Get that. Hello? Mary, how are ya? Yeah, I'm not here. I'm not here! He's not here. Whoa! Easy, babe, all right, all right. Yeah, yeah, hold on a second. She says you're full of shit, Ange. I don't care what she says, I ain't talkin' to her. You tell her, that if she don't stop calling me, and pissing me off, I'm gonna come over there and get that jewelry I gave her and stuff it down her fucking throat! You hear that, Mary? You hear that, you bitch? Give me this! Hey, what are you laughing at? Listen! What? Why? Are you kidding me? You marry him-- You marry that scumbag, I'm supposed to accept that? Yeah, bullshit! Bullshit! Whoa, Ange. Ange! Look at this. What? This ain't good. Ashley, are we rolling? What's the story? How's my hair? It's important. It's quite a scene, here. Stay with me, stay with me. - Is there a mob war going on? - Get out of here! Can you make a statement? Get out of here. Rudy! Get the fuck out of here. Who do you blame for this fire? You piece of shit! Let's go, Rudy. Well, you just saw it, I have just been assaulted. Are we... Are we on? Jerry? Jerry! What the hell happened? What do you think? They lit the place up. Dellarosa? Who else? Threw a fireball right in the door. Jesus... - Who's that? - Rocky. No. Can't believe it. Kid was 17 years old. I don't know, Ange. I don't think Dellarosa's exactly being straight with us about wanting to keep negotiating. Anybody else get hurt? That's it. Jesus! Look at my jacket. We are definitely in an area here of way too fucking close. You done the math yet on what would've happened if we'd show up on time? I give myself a heart attack just thinking about it. It's not my place, Ange, I gotta say it. This war is for the fucking birds. Not even making any money anymore, you know? I don't mean to sound venal, but I like a little jingle jangle in my pocket from time to time. That's me. Can't remember the last time we had a really big score... Rudy, please, just shut up for one second. Today is my 50th birthday. Jesus. What the hell happened? I wonder about that. I really do. Ange. What? Where we goin'? Um, Pop's house. How you doing, fellas? Doing good, Mr. Martinelli. Come in. Well, what happened? They hit the warehouse. With what? Fire bomb. Jesus Christ! That's it. That's the limit. Calls me for a sit-down and then this? They, they got that kid, Rocky. Maybe we out to send someone-- How's the building? Give me that! It's not great. Aye-yi-yi. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. He hurts me... I'm gonna hurt him. Listen, Pop, we've been hurtin' them for six months. It's turning into one of these back and forth things now. Jesus Christ, listen to that! My kid sits around, sipping espresso, picking up bag money. Figures that makes him crown Prince of Cappuccino or something. Pop, all I'm saying is we're not making money anymore. You know what your problem is? You're a goddamn coward. Got no stomach for a fight. Get me out of here. I got a gambling joint. I remember this one son of a bitch. Who was it? Dutchman, Pop. Right, the Dutchman. They burned that joint, 26 people got hurt. They burn the gambling joint, we don't just sit there and take it. We hit 'em back! We go right to their houses! Right into their homes. They burned our gambling joint! They burned our gambling house! Dad, Dad, Dad, just-- Just... Calm down. We're talking about a warehouse. Warehouse. Not the gambling joint, we're talking about a warehouse. I know that. What is that, supposed to be some kind of crack? You feelin' all right? You want a glass of water? Seltzer or something? Seltzer! What do I want with a goddamn seltzer? You know I hate seltzer. Makes me burp. I'll tell you what we're gonna do. And we all agree on this, am I right? Right. We're gonna start picking off his people, one by one. And the first one's gonna be-- What was his name? Carmine. Carmine! Carmine Dellarosa. Who? Carmine Dellarosa. Who's that? What the hell do you care? Carmine Dellarosa. Carmine Dellarosa. Well, yeah, but don't you mean Carlo? What? No, I mean Carmine, goddamn it. I don't know who that is. Let me show those son of a bitches that I'm serious. Listen, Pop, I mean, if you want me to fix this thing, I gotta know who the guy is. I never heard of him. Dellarosa bastard, he's gonna come to me begging, on his knees. You mark my word. When I'm through with him, he's gonna see how serious I am. I got a stone. A stone here! You watch. You watch and see, Frank, if I'm right. Give me the smoke. Okay. Slow down a little. - Yeah, hello? - Hello, Angelo. Mary! What-- What the hell are you doing? Are you nuts? This is my father's office! I told you! Just keep your voice down. Okay, fine, I'll meet you. At th-the-- The place. What are you gonna do? Stand there looking at your shoes? Go get somebody to do the job, make the contract. Listen, Pop, I think maybe you should, um... Well, I mean-- What? Well, I just think-- Don't think, okay? I don't want you to think. You got a problem? No, but, um... No, you listen to me, okay? You're thinking because you're my kid, you can get away with this back talk crap, right? No, wrong! You're wrong. And I'll tell you what, you're gonna get this thing done or you're gonna be sorry, you understand? Dead sorry. Now you're gonna go do it, and don't come back here until it's finished. I don't want to see you. You got that? Get out. Birthday. Yeah, happy birthday. One more. One more! No. At 5:00, he's going to be at 98 Primrose-- Wait a minute, you mean today? I've only got six hours? He's expecting a driver to pick him up there... Hey! I only got six hours? It's his cousin's house. Old man Dellarosa has a summer place. Nobody's there, totally unguarded. You with me? Yeah, I'm with ya. These are the directions to the house. The key. Do it there, leave him there. Um... Let Dellarosa find him in the pool. Carmine Dellarosa? - Carmine? - Rudy. Who the hell is that, Ange? I'm asking you, who the fuck is Carmine Dellarosa? I don't know. And we're gonna whack him? Would you just drive the car? Since when do we whack people we don't know who they are? Is this guy a civilian? Rudy. When is this supposed to go down? We gotta pick him up at 5. Today? Was this your old man's idea? Will you just drive the car? And I ain't doing it. I'll tell you that. I ain't poppin' nobody I don't know who they are. Fine, who's asking you? I'm just telling you, And I'll tell you this. This is pure lazy bullshit, that's what this is. Poppin' somebody's uncle, a brother-in-law. This is some accountant from Utica who's not even involved, and why? Because he's an easy pickin'. It's pure lazy bullshit. Are you through? Yeah, I'm through. So where we goin' now? You know the place downtown? The place I used to have? Yeah, the place. Take me there. Why? Can I ask why? I gotta meet Mary there for a second. Mary? Now? We don't got time now, Ange. Rudy! Please! Five minutes, right back. Mary? This better be good. Mary. Mary! Hi, baby. "" what? What the hell is this? What do you think? I think you've lost your mind. What's the matter, Ange? Don't you love me anymore? Love you? You're lucky I don't throw you out this window! Four years out of my life! Don't be like that. I told you, baby, a woman gets to be a certain age, she wants to be a married woman. You said no, so you got nobody to blame but yourself. I'd been married, I didn't like it. Hey, that ain't my fault, your wife was a bitch. Come on, Ange, you can't blame me for what I did, I want a kid, I want a ring, is that so bad? Don't mean we gotta stop. What? I miss you. You think that I'm gonna-- Why not? We did it when you was married. Why not? Why not? You been married two months, you wanna start screwing around? It's not screwin' around! What do you call it? It's different. It's with you. You know what I got to say to you? What? You wanna get laid? See your son of a bitch husband! How could you marry a guy like that? You know what he does for a living? No, it never came up. And don't give me that face, Ange, I never asked you either. I don't wanna fight. Come on... Let me give you something nice for your birthday. You still want me, I know you do. Lady, I wouldn't screw you if there was a gun to my head. Don't say that. Get used to it! I don't want to see you again, I don't want you to call me, I don't want to get these little poems in the mail. Nothing! Finished! Over! Go fuck yourself! Hey! You don't talk to me like that. I ain't one of your stupid eighth avenue broads. Let me tell you something else. Next time I see that husband of yours, I'm gonna ruin his whole fuckin' week! She belted you. I tell ya, you gotta love a broad like that. Or shoot her. I don't want to talk about it. No problem, okay? It's no problem. Let's talk about your father. Come on, listen to me. Here's the thing... - My father's a great man. - You know he's a great man. He's been wonderful to you, your whole family. Absolutely, I'm not arguing that, Ange. You'd still be picking up garbage in Poughkeepsie. So you don't you go giving me-- I'm grateful, okay? He give me a break, I'll give you that. It's just that when a man is as great as he is, - as he was-- - Hey. Just hear me out, when a man is as great as your father was, the people who care about him shouldn't let him mess up that greatness. You know, besmirch it. Your father has a place in history, Ange, and the people who care about him can't let him screw that up just because he's fucking crazy. I'm not complaining about the rough stuff, mind you, I've done my share of the tough ones. I know. You remember Joey Maloney? Did that get ugly or what? And did I complain? No. Damn right I didn't. It was disgusting what I had to do to him. Are you all right, buddy? Yeah, stiff neck. Morning! Please, please, please, no singin', but I appreciate the thought. - Anybody got any aspirin? - Aspirin? What's the matter, you sick? We got word on a job today. Yeah? Yeah. We gotta take out... - Carmine Dellarosa. - Who? You mean Carlo? No, he means Carmine. Ange, who the hell is Carmine? What, are we whacking off strangers now? You gonna blow out the candles? Come on, Ange, make a wish. - Very nice. - Good, Ange. So who's in? Who? You want volunteers? Clued me out. Don't look at me. Ange, I can't see myself doing this thing. I mean, not knowing who this guy was and all, you know-- Unless we can convince this guy to commit suicide, we gotta pick a shooter, all right? We gotta find someone. Who? Somebody close, 'cause we only got about five hours. What if we can't find nobody? I don't know. I guess you guys gotta draw straws. Okay. Ange, that stinks. I don't know, Ange, sometimes I wish I was just a regular Joe, you know? Like a... blackjack dealer or something. You want out, you can bow out. You don't have to come if you don't wanna. Come on, Ange, you know me? For richer or poorer. You see, my father wasn't always nuts. He just had a... funny idea about... what was... appropriate. He told me to get his hat out of the car. Out of the car... It was a trick. Kind of a strange present to give a child, when you think about it. Hey, Ange, how 'bout that guy Mick? What? Mick. No, no, he's not around anymore. What's he, dead? Nah, he moved to Mexico. Same diff. How about Bernie Espazedo, He's around. What about Bernie? For crying out loud. Bernie with the shakes? What's he gonna do? That guy couldn't kill a shed kitten. You don't know that. Jimmy, do me a favor, forget about Bernie. So how we doin'? Well, as far as we can figure, we got two possibilities. There's, Benny Crippa, and this Jefferson guy. How about Charlie Flynn? He's a wacko. He'd do it. I bet he would. Hey, Ange, how 'bout Flynn? No, absolutely not. What's wrong with him? I don't like him. What's not to like? He's the perfect guy. Ange, he's fucking batshit. Clip his own mother. Yeah. I got a score to settle with him. Why don't you hire him first, and then settle it after? That's a good idea, hire someone and then clip 'em. How do I get anybody to work with me after that, Einstein? Okay, Ange, sorry I brought it up. So it's Crippa or Jefferson. Yeah. Jesus Christ. The fuck is going on? Geez, Dellarosa's on a fucking rampage today. You believe this, Ange? Jimmy, go take a look. Why me? Jimmy! I'm just saying you're closer. Hey, do me a favor, take that gun, stick it in your mouth - and shoot yourself. - What'd I do? Ange, where you going? No, no, no, no. No, you don't want to try in there, stay down. Stay down there. Be careful. - All right. - Jesus. There they go, Ange. Fuckers. They're gone. Let's get out of here! I got glass in my sleeve. Lift! Come on, ladies, keep smiling. Here we go! Come on, girls! Ready? Geez, look at that, Ange! - All right, all right. - Come on, let's go. - ...three, two, one. - Grapevine, left, let's go. No, no, no. No way. What do you mean, "no"? What did ya do, retire? Look, I'm into a whole new thing here, Ange. I'm sorry. That's it? I know you 20 years. I don't know what to say to you. I'm all done with that stuff. I wanna do this now. You gotta be kiddin' me. You wanna spend the rest of your life jumpin' around like a fuckin' fruit in one of those, Tony suits? It's not that bad. I mean, it's a healthy life. You could use a workout now and then, ya know? Hey! No offense. Watch your mouth, Mister Health. I'll shove some bee pollen up your ass. Friendship means nothin' to you? Allegiance? Nothin'? Look, it's not personal. I couldn't afford to stay in. There's 15-year-old kids out there'll pop somebody for a fucking cheeseburger. Yeah, where? Rudy, I got a wife. I got three kids. - I ain't goin' back. - You're breakin' my heart. - Let's go. - Come on, come on. Tony? Yeah? Ever think you'd like to get in shape? Lose a few pounds? Want a punch in the mouth? - Holy shit. - I wouldn't want to have to take a piss in that thing. Look at that. Where is my fuckin' money? What'd you say, bitch? I don't have it. Jefferson here? What? I don't got the money! You got an appointment? I can't hear you, bitch! An appointment? It's all right, Alphonse. I know these guys. Please, come in. Angelo. Jefferson. How are you, my brother? Good to see you. Good to see you. Rudy, how ya doin'? Good to see you. You all right? - What's goin' on, J? - Welcome. Please, gentlemen, have a seat. How can I help you? A job, um... We gotta clip Carmine Dellarosa. You mean Carlo. Well, who's he? You go around killing people and you don't know who they are? Ours is not to question why... I'm very sorry, gentlemen, but I cannot help you. And why is that? I don't pop people these days. You know what I'm into now? Small stuff. Cut off a foot. Or a hand. Burn 'em with a lighter. He's maiming. He's into maiming. Beat 'em with a pipe. - Yes, sir. Pull out their teeth. Absolutely. What the hell you pull out their teeth for? Debt mostly. That's got to hurt. A rock and a hard place, Rudy. A fuckin' rock and a hard place. Come on, Ange, it's not that bad, all right? Make it simple. Just go to your pop and say: "Nobody wanted to do it. We couldn't find anybody." Did you ever say anything like that to my father? Ange, you know what I say? Why not try Flynn? Again with this. Let's give him a call. I agree with Tony. We're goin' nowhere. Ange, let me call him. I mean, we got no choice. You wanna do it? You wanna whack him yourself? No. So let me call him. All right. Okay? Yeah, okay, fine. Go call the son-of-a-bitch before I change my mind. Hi. Is Charlie around? Tony. Flynn. This is what we're comin' to? This is who we are? We hire fuckin' nut bars like Charlie Flynn? Will you get off of my back? - Hung up on me. - Flynn? His wife. He's got a wife? Who'd marry a guy like that? Some tongue on that broad. Nice language. Maybe we should go over there and talk to him in person. No, no, Ange! Ange, no. No, we got it this time. You shouldn't have to pay on your birthday. Jimmy. Ange, it could be worse. How is that? It could be you gettin' clipped. Yeah. That'd be worse. Sometimes I think if I've gotta listen to these voices for one more second, I swear to God... That was the first time I ever saw a gun up close. And Dad... makin' out like he was... some kind of a bandit. And Mom. She just about had a fit. "Put it away, put it away." Mom. Hey, Ange. We're here. Yeah, sorry. Rudy. Yes. Over here, come on. Take a walk. Hey, Tony, what are you doin'? Hello, Mary. What do you want? Well, I-I need to talk to your husband. Is Charlie here? No! Are you, expecting him? You think I'm gonna tell you where he is? Look, I, I know what I said earlier-- Great. No, I just-- Could I just come in for second? Just a second? You got a lot of fuckin' nerve, you know that? Mary, please. You wanna do somethin' to him, right? No! Bullshit! I'm in a jam here. It's a different situation from this morning. What do you want him for? I just wanna talk to him. It's a business thing. Liar! I am not lyin'. Honest to God, on a stack of bibles. You gonna tell me where he's at? You gonna tell me when you're expecting him? Are you expecting him? Are you not living together anymore? Are you separated? I'm not tellin'! Look, I don't wanna fight with you anymore, 'cause you're upset about what happened earlier today. Okay, I'm sorry. I had a bad morning. Mary, I am running out of time here. All I'm asking is where is your husband? It's a simple thing. You're acting as if I'm gonna shoot him! I swear to you, that's not the case. I-I give you my word. If I tell you, what'll you give me? Whatever you want. Whatever I want? Yeah. What do you want? Money. Money? You want me to give you money? Yeah. You're a piece of work. Yeah. Hey. Hey! Hey! Rudy, I get the feeling that Ange knows this dame. Ya know? Think so? Yeah. No. No, way. And, and? Come on. Pleasantville Hospital. He's in the hospital? Yeah. Hey, Mary, is it okay if I put on this--? Get the hell out of here! You heard him. Get outta here. Wait a minute. Who was that? Was that a guy? That was a guy! What the fuck is the matter with you? I don't like bein' alone, okay? I guess not. What do you know, anyway? Why don't you get outta here? You got what you wanted. That ain't right. You don't know anything about right. You're a goddamn thug! Thug? What do you mean, thug? What are you beatin' on me for? You cut people's heads off and you point a finger at me? Are you nuts? What head? You know what I'm talking about. You can't talk to me that way. Yeah? Who's gonna stop me, you? Yeah, me. And I got four guys waitin' outside who'd happily break your friggin' neck if I asked them. So don't start with this-- Shut up. Shut up? Okay, have it your way. I'm sick of your mentality. I don't why you're so goddamn mean to me. What did I ever do to you? I'm a good person. Your husband's lying sick in the hospital and you're screwin' half of the friggin' city! What do you think he's in there for, appendicitis? It's a mental hospital. It is? He's been committed. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He is? Yeah. Since when? I don't know, a couple of weeks ago. He just kept gettin' worse and worse. Gee, Mary, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I couldn't take it anymore. He was sick. He just was hittin' me and stuff. No. Yeah. He stuck me with a kitchen knife. That's terrible. Why didn't you tell me? I was embarrassed. Aw, ya poor kid. I figured you'd just say I deserved it. Sweetheart, I never would've said anything like that. You wouldn't? No. Nobody deserves that. I have to go to work. All right, now what? Any ideas? Flynn's out, right? We can't use him now. No, of course not. But where's that leave us? Maybe we could get Charlie, like, ya know, a day pass. Come on. Here we go. No, no, no! No, no, no! Sheesh. Nurses! Rudy! Listen, honey, we need to take a patient out for the afternoon. This afternoon? Yeah, how do we go about doin' that? You gotta get permission. Well, who do we get that from? Doctor. Which doctor? The patient's doctor. Are youse havin' fun with me? 'Cause if you're havin' fun with me, I'm gonna have fun with you. Let me see Charlie Flynn's doctor. Charles Flynn? Yeah, how's he doin'? How do you mean? How do I mean? Yes. I mean, is he all right? Yes, um, his condition is improving. You're from the State Board, aren't you? No. Yes you are. No. Yes, you are. No. No. We're family. I see. Is he still violent? Violent? Yes. Jeez, that's too bad. Well, of course, he's still violent. What am I expected to do, work miracles? Let me tell you something. I protest. I protest in the most vigorous terms, the Board accusing me-- --of, of, of, of, of incompetence. They take away my practice, and-- And then dump me down here in the midst of all this...bedlam! What was it you wanted? Could you let Charlie out for the day? What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. That is completely out of the question. He's still very, he's still very violent. Come on, Doc, you said he was okay. You said he was better. He's-- He's better than-- Than he was. H-he's-- He's coming... You know, h-h-he's coming along. Heh. When he first arrived here, he was completely out of, um, out of, you know, out of touch. But now, after only two weeks of my-- Of my therapy, he finally understands that this is not the thing at all. But he's still a-- Still a remorseless brute. But he is tr-- You know, he's trying. Tryin' what? Trying to feel. This man is trying to cultivate a conscience like it was a house plant. Groundbreaking. And these fucking charlatans around here are calling me a drug-addicted quack. Let me tell you, Charles Flynn... Charles Flynn was-- Let me help you with that. Boy. Can we see him? Hello, Charlie. Hello. How ya been? How have I been? Pft, how have I been?

Pft, fuck the door, he's pissin' in the sink. All right, come here. - Here's what we're gonna do. - You're gonna switch clothes and get into the bed. Me? Why me? Because Jimmy's gotta do somethin' else. And I can't get Charlie to wear that fuckin' outfit. I gotta do somethin'? Yeah. When I tell ya, you go into the hall - and you create a diversion. - Man, like what? Like, I dunno, run around screamin' like you're a rabbit. A rabbit? Why does it have to be a rabbit? Just fuckin' do it. How long do I have to be here? Just a couple hours, till we get back. - I just lie there? - Yeah. If a nurse comes, you just pull up the covers and start snorin'. Charlie.

Come on, Ange. Beat it! Ange, please. Leave! Aw, man! See ya later, Tony. Bye, Tony. Can't we walk? Jesus Christ! Hey, no! Come on, guys! Charlie, please. You got a gun? Gun. You got a gun? No, mine's in the shop. They didn't give ya a loaner? When I went down there all they had were these giant, chrome things, like fuckin' Howitzers. What am I gonna do with that? Walk around with that fuckin' thing in my pants. Where's yours? I gave it to Tony. Why? It was messin' up my sweater. What? It's a $300 sweater. I really think we're gonna need a gun, Ange. I gotta feel somethin'. I gotta feel somethin'. Crap, nothin'! What are you gonna do, surgery? Come on, come on, come on. Here we go. Now, are all of these clean? Yeah, sure, Ange. There's no numbers here. Hey, you want somethin' neat? You want a Mac? Mac is a nice piece. Thirty rounds. Pop-pop-pop-pop. A lot of people want this thing. Call it the "room broom." It sweeps right up. Get it? What do ya say? Yeah, whatever. How 'bout the Colt? Yeah, just give us the Colt. Hurry up. Well, you're certainly in a hurry. You goin' someplace? Yeah, we're going duck hunting. And what's this gonna cost? Two grand. Aye, yai. Little money grubber. It's a collector's item. Yeah, a lot of collectors want guns with the serial numbers filed off. Fifteen hundred. A grand. You want ammo with that? Nah, don't bother. We're gonna throw it at him. Two bucks each. Two bucks? How 'bout two punches in the face? Two bucks each. Fuckin' thief. How we doin'? Ten minutes. Seventy-four. Now I recognize it. He's expecting his driver to pick him up. What was that, 78? Now, you just tell him: "The car is here." - You got that? Don't get cute. - "Your car is here." Okay? Ange, I got it. We're nice and simple. Yeah. Gotta get outta here before the real guy shows up. Yeah? Hey. How ya doin'? Is, Carmine Dellarosa here? That's me. Great. Is, Carmine Senior here? There's no Carmine Senior. You're Carmine Dellarosa? You the driver? What? I gotta say bye to Nana. Would you take my bag? Excuse me? Put my bag in the car. Are you fucking kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me? Him? Him! Holy fuck. Rudy, just get in the car. Are you gonna do this? Will you just-- What the fuck is the matter with you? This? This?! Rudy, if we're still arguin' here in five minutes, we're gonna get shot! Get in the car. Rudy. Please, j-just get in. We'll talk about it on the road. Go. Go! I can't fucking believe it. Hi. Ange, can we... can we just sit down on this? Can we just-- Will ya just-- I'm tryin' to drive! Where are we goin'? Just shut up! I gotta think. Give it a rest, you bum! Kid. Hey. How old are you? Nine. Thanks. The kid's 9, Ange. Nine years old. Where's Archie? Who's Archie? My regular driver. he got the afternoon off. Ange, please. Rudy, listen! I got no choice. You know the rules. What rule? What rule are you referring to? If I disobey my pop on this one, do you know what's gonna happen to me? What? For Christ's sake, you're not telling me you think your pop's gonna clip you? He said that? Are you kiddin' me? He actually said that? My... I don't know what's more ridiculous here, the fact that he said that or that you need more proof your old man has lost his fuckin' mind. All right, we just need a plan here, that's all. Okay? So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a U-turn, we're gonna drop the kid off on a corner, any corner, We tell your pop that the original driver picked him up early. Okay? That's not disobeyin'. All right? Nobody's seen us with him, nobody knows we got him. Dellarosa will find out he was snatched, he'll be very nervous, keep an eye on the kid. Your pop won't be able to clip him, he'll have to pick somebody else. There's your plan. Whether we do the kid or not, I still get paid. Shut up, ya nut bar. Ange, it's simple, okay? I can't believe we're gonna do this. No, no, you can't talk to me that way. He can't talk to me that way. Hey, Charlie. You think you're the only crazy one in the front seat? I don't give a shit how desperate you are with your macramé-- That's it. Pull over. Take me to the hospital. I quit. Hey, put a cork in it, or I'm gonna smack the both of youse. I'm leaving now. Let me out. Where ya goin'? I don't need to stay in it. Don't fuckin' look at me. Hey, kid. Kid! Hey, come here. Get right up on here. Look at that face, Ange. Will you look at that? Look at the little guy. Rudy, will you just stop it? Okay, kid, thanks. I just wanted to show him the nice haircut. I've been doin' this a long time, it's not right. Let's do it. Let's just drop him off. Come on. I-- I-I-I can't! Why not? Will you stop yelling at me? I'm stuck. I can't turn! That's no big deal. It's just traffic. As soon as we get to the other side of the tunnel, you turn around. That-- That's-- That's great. Ya know, you got some attitude on you, you know that, pal? I remember thinkin', this is gonna be fun. This is gonna be really cool. My dad showin' me how. What could be better? The way he held the thing like a fuckin' paintbrush. Loudest thing I ever heard. Hey, Ange! What a coincidence? You believe this shit? - You know what the tie-up is? - I was just up there on foot. There's this giant fuckin' mongrel lying right there in the middle of the road, just restin' there. This fuckin' big. Looks like a dinosaur. You believe this shit? No. Who's the kid? Hey, isn't that... No. Fuck. Mind if I smoke? I don't care if you burn. Why are we going this way? Well, w-we gotta run a couple errands before we take ya home. Okay. Don't get me home after 6. If I'm late for dinner, my dad'll kill me. Has that, car always been back there? You think he's followin' us? Make a right. Shit. Are we racin'? No, everything's fine, kid. Just take it easy, all right? Wow! Ange, that's water. Water, Ange! Aah! - Son of a bitch! - Somebody's shooting. Aah! Jesus! What's the matter with those guys? We got a kid in here. Are those guys friends of his? Yeah, friends and relatives. Hey, where are you going? Hey! Hey! You recognize this kid? I'll throw him out of the car right now! Turn it around! Turn it around! Good job, kid. Looks like you scared them away. I want to go home. Hey. Not having fun yet? Is that your airplane? It's nice. I built it. You built it yourself? Wow. What sort of plane is it? It's a SPAD XIII. A SPAD XIII. Yeah, it's from-- It's from World War I. They used it to shoot down all the Germans. That's really nice. It's French. Let me see that. That's beautiful. Where are we going? We're gonna take you someplace real special. Are you kidnapping me? Me? No. Why would you say something like that? Hey, Ange, tell the kid where we're going. We're, going to your dad's summer house. Is my mom gonna be there? Yeah. Your-- Your mom's gonna be there. I mean, everybody's gonna be there. Maybe not when we arrive, but they'll be there. They'll be there. You have my word on that. I'll go in the house with you. These guys wanna wait out here. Nice place. I cannot believe you're gonna let this happen. We do this, what's it gonna be tomorrow? It's gonna get worse. How far down are you gonna let us get before you do something here? What? Will you shut your goddamn mouth? This isn't my fault. I'm not the one making this happen. This wasn't my idea. You're the one letting it happen. You want a soda? Um, no. No, thanks. What's that? That right there. Gun. You better not let my mom see that. She hates guns. Well, I'll try to be real careful about that. Here's one. Thanks. Why do you have it? What? For what? Um... I gotta shoot you, kid. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. Does this still work? Thing's ancient. The serial number's off. A couple of-- This is bent. That's great. What'd I do? Fucking relic. What? Um... I don't know. Sit down. Jesus. Hey, kid! I don't know. After this, I gotta rethink some things. Rudy, come on. Look at you. You're sweating. You're shaking. You don't want this, but you're too chicken. What do you want from me? If we don't do the kid, I gotta do my dad! He's an old man, Ange. Kid! Kid. Please, don't do this. Well, I can't do this one for you, Ange. It's your choice. You know? Kid. I'm gonna find you. Ha! Hey... Shoot. How did I get this stuck? I'm sorry, Rudy. Kid, cut it out. Kid! Kid. Jesus Christ, cut it out! Please, please, please, please, please! Let go of my leg. No! Let go! No! No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No. Do that again. My leg. Grab my leg and-- And say, "No, no, no." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! Holy cow. Ooh. Ooh. Look at that. Thank you. Thank you. God, kid, thank you, thank you, thank you. Ooh, you're so cute. Holy cow. Holy-- Ange, thanks. I mean, this is great. I feel so good. I mean, I had an experience now. Unbelievable. That I don't even want the money. I just feel so-- Holy cow. I feel... I feel. I feel. I gotta-- I gotta-- I gotta see my doctor. I gotta go back to the hospital. I gotta share. Boy. That ain't good. Rudy, he's alive! Yeah, yeah. I see that, Ange. That's great. Yeah, it's great. He's got the gun. Yeah, well, that's the downside. What the hell are we gonna do now? I don't know. Why are you asking me? Hey, should we make a run for it? Into those trees over there? Yeah. I don't know. Looks dicey. Got a better idea? Not really. It beats sitting around waiting to get shot. You got a good point, Ange. Okay, on the count of three. Ready? One-- Ange. Ange. Two-- What? Ange, Ange. What? All right, kid. Here's what we're gonna do. The chasing part was fun, but why don't we put the gun down now and we'll just go home? How about that? Put the cannon on the ground and we'll put it in the car and we'll-- It's all over now. No, don't shoot! Don't shoot, Carmine. It's okay. It's okay. It's-- It's okay. Just stop. Stop. Just stop. You don't have to shoot. Just don't. Don't! Give me it. Hey, Rudy. Hey, that's the first time I've-- I've faced down a gun. I guess I ain't such a chicken-- Rudy? Rudy. Rudy. Hey, Rudy. Rudy, come on. Don't-- Don't do this. He's dead. I was talking to him 10 seconds ago. Rudy. Rudy. What do you want me to do with the kid? Take him back. Take him home. Go on, get out of here! Rudy, you're bleeding all over your... Got it on your shirt. Put on your belt. Do you know how to drive? Ange? I took it from him and then it went off, and I was laughing. I said, "Rudy..." But when I turned around, he... he was laying on the ground, and... I didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Mary. Is there a problem here? Go home, Harry. Go on, beat it. That's just great. No, that's fine. Shit... I didn't know you were coming over. I know. It's okay. Look. Ange, look. Look. There he is. You could say goodbye, Ange. What? Say goodbye to Rudy now. Say goodbye. Go on. Goodbye, Rudy. There you go. Goodbye, Rudy. I'm just gonna stay a little while, okay? It's okay, honey. You don't have to explain. I'll leave in just a little bit. No, shh. Do you want me to come in? No, it's okay. Go on home. Okay. I'll call you in the morning. Okay. Go on, beat it. Who's that? It's okay, Pop. It's just me. So did you kill him? Yeah. I killed him. Good. I was thinking... maybe we ought to clip someone else too. Who was it? Go to sleep, Pop. I'm so tired. What time is it? It's late. Just go back to sleep. I was dreaming. I was going somewhere. Go home, guys. Get some rest. You sure? It's okay? Yeah. Go on home. Thanks, Ange. See you later. Yeah, see you later. I don't know. They give you something, they take away something else. It's not all one way.
