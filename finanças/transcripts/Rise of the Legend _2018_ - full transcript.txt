CHAMPION Boy, is your boss around? He went out for lunch. Can you change the string for me? I want the best string. What do you think? Do you like it? It's yours after you string it. You're giving it to me? But... my dad doesn't allow me to play badminton. That's because you played without a purpose. How about this? There's a charity competition tonight. I'll do the registration for you. Charity competition? Don't you know? Helping others makes one happy. You can play badminton and help others at the same time. As long as you help people, your dad won't stop you from playing badminton. - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! Why are there only adults here? Only adults have money to do charity.

Here are some haw flakes for Chong Wei. You're so generous. Did you win the lottery? - How did you know? - Really? Yes, your son, Chong Wei, played an underground match yesterday. He played very well. I was lucky to bet on him. I won 250 ringgit. Rascal. Hey! Chong Wei! - What happened? - Chong Wei! Come out, Chong Wei! Where is Chong Wei? - Ah Chai. - Chong Wei! Where is Chong Wei? What happened? - Chong Wei! - What happened? What happened? Do you know he played underground badminton? - What? - That means you know nothing! How do you teach our children? Look at this! I tell him to study hard, but he doesn't listen. He only plays badminton! What's the use of these gold trophies? You've spoiled him! - Ah Chai. - Ah Chai. Calm down. - Don't be angry. - Listen to me. - Go away! - Ah Chai! Boss, I brought him. Who says that playing badminton cannot help to support the family? If you throw this match, all this money will be yours. What the heck are you doing? Do you know how to play? Ah Chai, are you all right? Don't cry. It's okay. I'm sorry. This baby was born into our family. His fate is surely tragic. We can be more frugal. Eat a little less rice. Eat a little less congee. We can still raise him. It's okay. Don't cry. Are you okay? Are you sure, Ah Chai? We can win this match, Ah Chai. Come on. Hurry! - Don't run! - Don't run! Run! - Stop! - Don't run! Azmi. Azmi. Azmi! Azmi! Azmi! Azmi! Move aside. Hurry, move aside! Chong Wei! Come home with me! Lee Ah Chai. Long time no see you. So this is your son. No wonder he's as good as his dad. You can't take him away. What do you want? You still owe me a game. Let's settle it tonight. I don't want to. Are you scared? We're not scared! I know you've stopped playing for years because of Azmi. What you did was right. But for our son, you'll have to play this game. If we win, don't ever disturb our family again. What if you lose? If I lose, I'll do as you wish. Dad. I'm sorry. I didn't know he was lying. Listen up. If you really want to play badminton, I'll send you to Teh Peng Huat's tomorrow. If you want to play, give it your all. Understand? One. Two. One. Two. One. Two. One. Two. Lee Chong Wei, do it properly. One. Two. One. Two. The basis of playing badminton consists of hand skills and step skills. Hand skills consist of... Backhand grip. Forehand grip. Halfhand grip. Net side grip. Lob grip. The first is a blank hit. The second is a real hit. The first and second are blank hits. The third is a real hit. If your standing position is correct, the court compound will be small. If your standing position is wrong, the court compound will be huge. One step. Two steps. Left step, move. Right step, hit. QUALIFIER, BADMINTON ACADEMY MALAYSIA Coach, have a drink. Chong Wei and Ah Chai will be back soon. - Mrs. Lee. - Yes? I'm not here to look for Chong Wei. Is it about the fees? Sorry, we'll pay you by next week. No, please take a seat. I'm not here for the fees. I would like to talk about Chong Wei. What are you doing? Mom, I'm excited. I wonder when I can go to Kuala Lumpur. They told me. The national team didn't pick you. Why? They said... they will choose you when you grow taller. I know. I am a dwarf. It's my fault. I didn't provide you with nutritious food. I heard that drinking potato root soup will help you grow taller. How about I cook it for you every day? Let's try again next year. Okay? Chong Wei, it's okay. It's okay. - Mom. - Yes? I've made you the potato root soup. Go and drink it. Okay. Mom, I finished it. Am I taller now? Yes. - Drink it again tonight. - Okay. Mom, am I taller now? Yes, taller than Chong Hoon. Really? Don't lie to me. - Drink it again tonight. - Okay. - Mom, I'm leaving for school now. - Okay. "Am I taller now?" Don't be nervous. Keep your tempo. Don't forget about your skills. Okay? Okay. Go! Are you okay? Cramp? Are you still able to play? - Are you good? Feeling better? - Are you okay? Are you sure you can continue? I'm okay. This is Lee Chong Wei from Bukit Mertajam. He beat some of our best players today. Although he didn't win, he never gave up. He's got some raw talent and potential. And I think he should be on the national team. I know him. He is famous in Bukit Mertajam. Doesn't he look like a monkey from a circus? I think his badminton technique is kind of a mess. And he has never been trained properly. That's exactly why we should take him. Isn't it our job to train and make them a better player and bring out the best of them? Why don't we vote? Raise your hand if you choose Lee Chong Wei. Eight against seven. I want him. All right. It's a draw. I agree to take him. There are so many dishes. What else are you bringing? Nothing. Just some biscuits. Why don't we finish these first? The table is full. - Eat. - Eat. - Mom, eat. - Dad, eat. - Okay, eat. - All right. You're leaving for Kuala Lumpur. We don't know when we'll see you again. Eat more. Thank you, Bee Kim. Bee Kim. Bee Kim, don't cry. What are you crying for? All right, don't cry. I thought you wanted to get married and stay in Kuala Lumpur. - Chong Eng. - Don't talk nonsense. Bee Kim, Kuala Lumpur is nearby. I will come back often. Hello. Here's another person leaving for Singapore. Showing off. You talk so loud. You think no one knows you're going to Singapore? Here's some cash. Use it wisely. - Thank you, Dad. - Thank you, Dad. Chong Hoon, take care of yourself in Singapore. We can never be too careful. There might be bad guys. Don't talk nonsense. Both of you must call home often. Especially you. Don't always hang out like the time when you were a kid. Hear that? Don't always hang out. - That's you. - It's you. Both of you are the same. Enough, let's eat. Eat and sleep early, then set off early in the morning. - Okay. - Bee Kim, come. - Let's eat. - Mom, let's eat. - Thank you, Mom. - Eat up. Is it true that you want to marry in Kuala Lumpur? Don't listen to him. Otherwise, why would he say so? - Are you in a relationship? - No. Wong Choong Hann? And Chan Chong Ming. Who are you looking for? I am looking for the hostel master, Mr. Haw. Do you know where he is? - I do. - Where? Sorry. Mr. Haw, I am... - Lee Chong Wei, right? - Yes. You're looking for your room? Follow me. The toilet is at the back. You can do your laundry and shower there. You can hang your clothes here. - Mr. Haw. - Yes. The girls' hostel is downstairs. You can't go there. You can't go out after 10 p.m. Lights will be off automatically. If you need light, the table light is available. Okay, here is your room. Any questions? - No question. - Okay. Gather in the field at 6 a.m. tomorrow. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Haw. - Good morning, Coach! - Good morning, Coach! Morning. Okay, take a rest. Not you. Five more rounds. Yes, Coach. Hey, Chong Wei. - You do weightlifting. - Okay, good. - Let me help you. - Thank you. No problem, come. One more. - He's so weak. - Chong Wei. - Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Coach. - Coach. We will go to All England. Only eight players will be selected. - Understand? - Yes, Coach! So all of you, show me your best. Show your commitment. Show your discipline. Until I choose you. - Understand? - Yes, Coach! Good. Continue training. Little boy. I heard you're famous in Bukit Mertajam. What's your name again? Lee... - Lee Chong Wei. - Lee Chong Wei. I don't care who you are. Old rules. Tonight at 9 p.m., see you at the badminton court. Chong Wei. You must be careful of Kun Cheng. When he smashes, it's extremely fast. Be serious. He always bullies the new guys. What's up? Are you praising me? How cute. Old rules. Three points to decide who wins. Play within the box. Chong Wei, score points within the box. In the box, Chong Wei. Yes! Do you understand the rules? Net. Push. Lift. Net. Tap. - Yes! - Yes. What is that? Little boy playing like a monkey? I told you he is from the circus. Playing like a country bumpkin? Chong Wei, come on. Chong Wei, you can do it. Where are your monkey tricks? Use it before you lose. Country bumpkin. Play your monkey tricks. Clothes for this month. Wash it. Let's go. Like a monkey playing badminton. Just now, you missed the Bukit Mertajam monkey playing badminton. Yes, it was so funny. I heard he was not qualified for the national team. I don't know how he got so lucky. Lucky brat. Sorry. Stand up. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, class. Sit down. Please open to page 90. May I borrow a pen? Thank you. Mew Choo. Don't forget our date. Tonight, let's practice together. Yang Kun Cheng! You're late again! - Go back to your seat. - Okay. Sorry. Ready. Remember what I taught you? Come on, let me teach you how to defend. Your wrist. Higher a bit. Then push like this. Correct. That's right. Just like this. Mew Choo. I want to return this to you. Mew Choo. Hey. - Mr. Haw. - Mr. Haw. What are you two doing? I'm teaching him how to play. Chong Wei. Misbun wants to see you. Good luck. Why did you come here? I... Don't tell me you don't know why you're here. Just tell him your dream. I want to be... world number one. World number one? Let me ask you. What have you done to achieve your dream? I will make your dream come true. However, are you willing to give me all your time and energy? Yes. Meet me at 5 a.m. tomorrow. Thank you, Coach. Haw. Hello? Hello? Is this Chong Wei? The world number one is crying? Mr. Haw. Everyone here doesn't lack opportunities. But determination. I don't know if those who stay will become world number one. But if you walk out, you will definitely not. Let's go. We'll go eat at the Mamak stall. Mr. Haw. It's 10:30 p.m. now. I am the hostel master. I set the rules. Let's go. Peace be upon you. And upon you peace. How are you today? The doctor said he wants me to take more high-protein food because it's good for my kidney. I see. Have you found the one you have been looking for? I hope... he is the one. Good morning. You woke up early. It's so early. Let's meet at the gym later, okay? He's so weird. I think he is crazy. - Forty-seven. - Forty-seven. - Forty-eight. - Forty-eight. - Forty-nine. - Forty-nine. - Fifty. - Fifty. Okay. REMEMBER TO RETURN THE PEN You can do it. Yee Hao. Chin Chok. Hafiz. Keng Quan. Chong Wei. The eight of you have been selected for the All England Championship. Congratulations. But remember. I want you to maintain your performance. - Understand? - Yes, Coach! For those who weren't selected, don't give up. Continue your run. Chong Wei. Coach. The doctor said there's some problem with my knee. I have to run on the grass. Okay. Ariff. Coach. Yee Hao. Jia Jun. Coach. Keng Quan. Coach. Kun Cheng. Coach. You haven't called my name. Your name is not on the list. Coach. That day, didn't you already choose me? Isn't your knee injured? So you stay here and have as much rest. Coach, sorry. Bring me, Coach. I'm ready. No more pain, Coach. - I'm cured. Look! - Lee Chong Wei! I already canceled your name. Why? Do you think the badminton court in England is made of grass? Coach. Coach. Coach! Coach. Please, Coach! I'm already okay, Coach. Coach. I'm okay. Coach. Please. - Chong Wei. - Mom. Why did you come back? It's okay. You're home now. - Dad. - Dad. - Mom. - Welcome back. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. Okay. Thank you. Come, sit down. The food will be ready. Sit down. - Okay. - Okay. Why were both of you not selected for the All England Championship? Dad, I'm sorry. My performance wasn't that good. I will work harder. It's okay. Just do your best. Mew Choo, how about you? I will work harder. Your sister had injuries that affected her performance. What about you? Don't look at your sister. Don't think I know nothing. You're in a relationship with that Lee guy, am I right? Listen up. If you want to date him, come back. If you still want to stay on the national team, stay focused on your training. They just arrived. Stop nagging. Come, let's eat. Let's eat. Dad, eat more. I had a bet with Jay. The one who loses pays for the court fees. Get it from him. But I didn't see Jay today. Are you saying I'm lying? Do I need to lie for this small sum? Don't bully the elders. Who are you? It's none of your business. I'll give you ten points. If you lose, you'll have to pay. Give me ten points? What if you lose? If he loses, whenever you come, I won't charge you. Deal. Who are you? I am Lee Chong Wei. I still remember when your dad first brought you here. You were always lazy. You didn't like the physical training. Don't think I didn't know you weren't jogging. Why didn't you expose me? You're smart. With your talent, you can beat my best student anytime. Your talent is just like this feather. You must collect them. Put them on the right shuttlecock. Then only can shuttlecock fly higher and further. You came to visit me. I feel happy about that. But it's time to go back. No matter what happens, Berapit is always your home. All, come here. - Hafiz! - Hafiz! - Hafiz! - Hafiz! Okay. Congratulations to Hafiz for becoming the All England champion. And also those who represented the country, a round of applause for them. I want all of you to listen. I want all of you to take Hafiz as an example. He was committed. He worked hard. He became the champion. Chong Wei. Coach. How is your knee? It has healed, Coach. Good. Put him on weights. I want him to train with Kun Cheng. - For 20 minutes. - Okay, Coach. Kun Cheng, lift up. Lift. Strike. More, jumping smash! Who said you can stop? Who said you can stop? Higher! Faster! I forbid you from touching the racket for a week. Starting tomorrow, come early and pick up the shuttlecocks. Lee Chong Wei. Mew Choo wants a few words with you. About All England, I already knew. Why didn't you tell me? I'm fine. Don't worry. Chong Wei. I have something to tell you. What is it? We have to break up, okay? Why? I thought we were doing fine. I know I shouldn't tell you this right now. But... my dad doesn't approve of our relationship. I know. I'm not good enough. No, it's not what you think. Chong Wei, listen to me. My dad wants me to focus on the training. He wants me to qualify for the next SEA Games. If I can't make it, he won't allow me to stay on the national team. Chong Wei. Let's work hard together and get a good result. So that he will accept us. Shall we? Mew Choo. It's time to go. I will wait for you. Chong Wei! What happened? - Mr. Haw. - Mr. Haw? Something happened to Mr. Haw. - Mr. Haw was in an accident. - What? - Chong Wei, wait a minute! - Chong Wei! Hurry up, Chong Wei! Hurry! Mr. Haw? It's not our fault. It was Mr. Haw's idea. Lee Chong Wei. Come here. I am Latifah, Misbun's wife. If Misbun did anything wrong to you, let me apologize on his behalf. No, I'm fine. Misbun is the eldest in his family. His dad raised him strictly. Because his dad had a dream to create a champion. So since he was young, Misbun has borne the dreams of the entire Sidek family. What am I proud of Misbun? It's his belief that there's no dream that can't be achieved. Except for those who give up early. Chong Wei. Your appearance in the team lit up his hope. Your dream is his dream. Do you know? The time that he spends with you is more than the time he spends with me. But I don't mind. Because we already treat you as part of our family. TO MEW CHOO CONGRATULATIONS, I'M PROUD OF YOU. SEND Don't just talk about it. You need to train too. Train. How else do you think Mew Choo won? Mew Choo... Chong Wei, come on. On my right, Lee Chong Wei from Malaysia. On my left, Ling Dan from China. Good job. Maintain your stamina, okay? All right. - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Ling Dan! - Ling Dan! LING DAN REMAINS STRONG So what do you think of Lee Chong Wei's performance? Lee Chong Wei is too old to be under our training. His technique has been rooted. He had no good basics. Of course he couldn't play well. Yes, his performance isn't stable. We'd better not waste our time. And I don't think he should go to All England. Misbun, what do you think? Chong Wei's skill is as good as Ling Dan's. But Ling Dan distracted his tempo. He lacks confidence and also the ability to overcome distractions. This is not about the skill. It's all about mentality. That is not an excuse! The fact is he couldn't beat Ling Dan. So what do you propose for the All England Championship? I hope that he can join. I'll bear all the responsibilities. Enough. Enough. I said stop! I said stop. Do you know why you lost? I don't have enough stamina! You don't lack stamina! You pressure yourself! I fight for the championship. Is that wrong, Coach? Chong Wei, listen to me. I need a player who can go far. Not a player who only thinks of winning a match. I want a player who can challenge every single match. And I want a player who can maintain his championship. Understand? Chong Wei. I know you can do it. I've already treated you as my son. I will pass on all my knowledge and experiences to you. You're going to be number one. Let's go. The bus has arrived. Coach, you can leave first. I want to walk back. Coach. Sorry, Coach. I've tried my best. Six more months until the Malaysia Open. Ling Dan will be back. Just fight back. I heard you're leaving BAM. Is it true? Then who will train me? I don't know. I heard he's a coach from China. Li Mao. But the important thing is you must learn from him properly. Do you know why I didn't let you go to the last All England? You and I. Both of us carry the weight to fight for the glory of our country. My job is to make sure that every player I choose is 100 percent ready. Actually, my purpose was to protect you. Do you remember why I wanted you to pick up the shuttlecocks? In the world of badminton, there's dignity. So when you throw your racket on the floor, it means that you're throwing your dignity on the floor. So how can we show glory for our country? When we pick up the shuttlecocks, we will bend down. We will be humble. When we are humble, no matter what challenges appear, we will have the strength to face them. - Understand? - Understand. Coach. Do you think I can defeat Ling Dan? Chong Wei. The spirit of badminton is not about winning or losing. Look at me. I want you to find back the passion when you began. And keep it deep in your heart. How's it going? How are you? Are you not used to the new coach? How did you know? Misbun was here. - Misbun? - Yes. He asked a lot about your youth. He wanted me to tell you this. In the upcoming Malaysia Open, the system of 21 points will be adopted. The tempo will be faster. So you'll need to maintain your physical training to have an instant power surge. Li Mao's training focuses on the skill part. He will help you. Wong Choong Hann was injured in the Thomas Cup. He needs half a year to rest. In this upcoming Malaysia Open, you will face Ling Dan again. Chong Wei. When you lose your confidence, think of the people who believe in you. Mr. Teh, I will go all out. Mom, you're still awake? Yes. How about you? Why do you keep these torn clothes? The blanket you used as a kid was sewn with all these cloth pieces. Chong Wei. I'm happy that you're taught by so many coaches. You must appreciate them. Maybe what they taught you is like all these cloth pieces. You need to patch them up piece by piece. Understand? Someday, it's going to be useful. I got it. Your mom is right. Ask yourself. Why do you play badminton? Tomorrow, you're going back to Kuala Lumpur. This is your favorite haw flakes. Take it. If you're playing only to be the champion, you already got it a long time ago. One day, I want to represent Malaysia to play badminton. Don't return to the center after a completed movement. Expand your center point. Use the first step after you land as your center point. And forecast the arrival of the next shuttlecock. Good afternoon, I am Ewan. Now, we are at Stadium Perpaduan for the final match of Malaysia Open 2006 between Lee Chong Wei and Ling Dan. I feel that this will be a very intense match that people have waited for with anticipation, especially badminton fans in Malaysia. At least it's mentioned like this from the papers... Boss, one ginseng coffee. Why did you come so late? The game is starting soon. This is a one-time event. Now, you can see and feel the passion from our badminton fans in Malaysia and also from China. It's getting heated up here and I can feel the heat burning inside the stadium. Malaysian Open 2006. The men's singles final is starting soon. The supporters' passion is coming to an extreme. We're awaiting the arrival of the two top players. Will Malaysia's first seeded player, Lee Chong Wei, defeat his strong rival, Ling Dan from China? We look forward to it. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the 2006 Malaysia Open. It's China's Ling Dan taking on the Malaysian hero, Lee Chong Wei. In the venue itself, as you can see behind me, national patriotism is running at an all-time high. Even compatriot, Wong Choong Hann, has come to show his support for Lee Chong Wei even though he's carrying an injury. On my right, Ling Dan, China. On my left, Lee Chong Wei, Malaysia. Love all. Play. A nice shot from Lee Chong Wei. We observe the speed of Ling Dan. He's famous for his speed and fast-paced wrist movement. What a quick tap from Ling Dan. Once again. Beautiful shot. It was Chong Wei's turn to finally execute a drop shot with the shuttlecock in front of the net and wait to tap. And that was a win for Lee Chong Wei. That is Chong Wei. - Chong Wei! - You're obviously excited. What are you feeling? If Chong Wei wins, Malaysia will announce a holiday. Holiday! If Chong Wei wins, I'll leave my car here and walk all the way home! - Yes! - Chong Wei! The match is still ongoing. A quick drop shot from Ling Dan. An exciting shot from Ling Dan. It's 18 to 15. Chong Wei has to score after this. An exciting shot from Ling Dan. He wins this set. The second set is over. Come on. After the fantastic and nerve-racking second set, Chong Wei needs to be very careful as Ling Dan is not a simple opponent. He uses all opportunities wisely. God bless. An aggressive smash from Ling Dan. Ling Dan is so fast. It's 11 to 7. Ling Dan is leading against Lee Chong Wei. - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Come on, Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei! - Lee Chong Wei!
