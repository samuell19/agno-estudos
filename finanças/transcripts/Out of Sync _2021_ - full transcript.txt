Because she's bad at making friends. So I started bathing my girl, as usual, and Maria started... cooking dinner. They were both lying right there where you are... They were both lying right there where you are, the couch used to be there. They fell asleep, and I started staring at them. I stood there, and I... ...I stood there, no idea for how long. Honestly, no idea. I thought I was the last one leaving. Well, you were wrong. How's it going? If I don't get too interrupted, I'll have it done. Does Phil know about all this? About what? About what's going on here. And the fact you've been occasionally sleeping in the studio. The cleaning lady finds you here most of the mornings, and you are not precisely an early bird. If nobody tells him, he doesn't have to find out. Promise me you won't spend another night here. I know you too well. I promise you. I don't know how much time had passed. Because that was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Hey! Just a little while and you go home, OK? Sure. ...cooking dinner, and they were both lying right there where you are... You scared me. I didn't mean to. You scared the fuck out of me. Even if you didn't mean to. I called you several times, and left a few messages. I really didn't want to go inside. I've been waiting in the nearby bar until it closed. Sure... but since you have the keys, you thought, "I'd rather wait for her on the couch." I've got the keys, because it's my apartment. Don't worry, I won't forget that. We said, until November. No. We never said November. You've just made that up. We agreed it's for the summer. It's still hot. Look, I'm not really good at playing the angry landlord. But this is urgent. We need the apartment. This isn't right, because... Because what? Because I no longer know what to tell Isa. We're living at her parents'. Alright. Well, tell her the squatter is leaving. I'll be gone by Friday. How's work? Good... The schedule is good. If you need any help with the boxes or. No, I was planning to pile them up and set on fire. I really mean it. They fell asleep, and I started staring at them. And I stood there, no idea for how long. Honestly, no idea. What's going on? Nothing, we were just... Why did you re-open this session? This reel must have been already delivered, no? Yeah... Uhm. We were just double-checking it. Double-checking? Why? It was out of sync. The Foleys. ADR. Everything. No way. - Well, it is. - Aurora. The latency was too high, but she fixed it, it's done now. I increased it because of the buffer. It's correct. It was marked at 68, and the correct one is 22 quarters of a frame. That's impossible. We have to re-check it now. Well, we are working on it now. Wait, hang on. We've already fixed it. There's nothing to discuss, it... - I'll call Phil, and we'll sort this out. - No. Let's not bring Phil into this. We'll solve it here, OK? The client has been warned. It'll take just a moment. Let's watch it together. No way. Because that was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Then the girl got tired. and started talking to the boy she met there. 22 quarters of a frame. What were you expecting? I'd say it hasn't been touched since it was installed, has it? It can't be possible. Trust me, something is wrong with the system. It's not the first time it happens to her projects. Aurora. The mixing guys returned two - in the past month! - Aurora, please. - Ivan! No. They need to know. Both! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Is it true? ...True? Both. Is it true? Both. I mean. Yes, it's true. I mean... We had to adjust a project in the last few weeks. Fuck, Ivan... - ...a project in the last few weeks. - Fuck, Ivan. You haven't told me anything, Ivan. I'm telling you, something is wrong with the system. It's not right. The system is... It's not right. The system is... Are you alright? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. Freezy breeze made these three trees freeze. I see you had an appointment last month, but didn't show up, did you? Yes, I was working abroad. I remember signing a 15-day sick leave, and you never picked it up. I was feeling fine. Right... And did you have another outbreak? Yes. Yes, I had one, but it was different. Since yesterday, I'm hearing with a delay. About a couple of frames off. A couple of frames? Fractions of a second. It's as if every sound I hear, is delayed. It happens with everything, including voices. I listen to you talk, I look at your lips, and. What could it be? The hearing exam and the lab tests show nothing unusual. As I've mentioned, stress can cause disorders like yours. If I tell you to take some time off work, you should listen to me. I was feeling fine, I've already told you. In any case, we'll continue with the MRI. Do you have any records of epilepsy in your family? Any relatives with similar outbreaks or mental illnesses? No. There's a genetic test programme related to neurological syndromes associated with epilepsy. It's relatively new, but I think it would be interesting to include you. To build a genetic map we'd only need a swab. Fine. And how does it work? You would only have to slip it into your mouth. Here... Sideways, please... That's right. And put in into this tube. That's right. Perfect, that's it. It would be great if we received your parents swabs too. My father died years ago. My mother is still alive, yes. I can bring hers. Any siblings? No, I don't have any. For your mother. Like an Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, it soothed me down. But when the dentist did the treatment did the treatment on the last tooth, it was the wisdom tooth, and since she fixed it, it started to hurt. I can barely stand it. - She will be mad, you know it. - I know. That's why I didn't want to tell her. You start, and then I'll explain to her that we're... - Did you see any pictures of the flat? - I couldn't look into it. - Yes, there's an Excel sheet. - Right, I'm sorry. I'm just too busy to look for an apartment. - OK, yes. - But you have some. Yes, yes. But your mother-in-law is really young. She is young, but she has widowed... too soon... Go on. Hey, are you alright? How are you? I'm fine, Ivan. Everything was so weird... You looked. - I told you I'm fine. - Okay, okay! - I was just a bit nervous, that's it. - Sure, no problem. I'm sorry I didn't talk to you before... We didn't really know. I'll be there first thing in the morning to fix the reel. In any case, the Foleys are all done. That's what I wanted to tell you. Hey, why don't you take a few days off? - Phil asked Aurora to finish it. - I don't need a few days off. - I'm going to talk to Phil. - OK, but listen. Aurora can perfectly finish it. No problem at all. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. What happened to you? Nothing. I fell in the bathroom. I must have been there for a while, I can't remember anything. Why didn't you call me? Why would I call you? I came to my senses, and there was nothing you could do. I went to get examined. Everything's fine. I must have had a sugar drop. You should have called me, mum. I did call you several times. Yesterday and today. No service. Well, there's no reception at the studio. And you don't mind there isn't, do you? I don't know, why you don't have WhatsApp. I chat with Rosa on WhatsApp. WhatsApp doesn't work on my phone. Then I'll buy you a new one. I don't want WhatsApp. I don't even want a cellphone. I have it only because it's mandatory at work. Don't you want to try some? I don't. I told you I had a sandwich just before you arrived. How old was I, when learned how to speak? What? I. took me a good while to start speaking, right? You didn't speak until you were three or four. But it's not that strange. And there was a man visiting us, right? He used to record me with a tape recorder. Yes, a speech therapist. It helped you in the beginning. Dear, is everything alright? Yes... I had completely forgotten, but I had a dream about it. Daddy used to record me too, right? Yes, sometimes he would. I always thought your fondness for gadgets comes from there. And those recordings, do we still have them? The tapes? So where could they be? I don't know. I guess the speech therapist kept them. Right... Divas from the cinema industry which are exactly these. Margaret Dumont, Paulette Goddard, Shirley MacLaine, Carol Lombard. Marilyn Monroe and Jean Arthur. As Juanjo said comedians, mind the clues. Dolores, the first to play, let's see if she stays there because it's related to this film genre. Listen, listen... She started as a choir girl in Sidfield's musical company and she reached the fame alongside Charles Chaplin in Modern Times and The Great Dictator... - What do you think? - Paulette Goddard. Paulette Goddard! After shooting Modern Times, Chaplin and Goddard. Oh my god! What happened? - Are you OK? - You were driving like a fool! Madam, you pounced on me You saw it, she pounced on me! I didn't have time to stop! The girl was walking quietly and you pounced on her! I was driving and she got off the side-walk! - I'm calling an ambulance. - Oh my god! Fools drive around without any respect! I'm calling from Alcalde Street... Mum! What have I told you? But I'm not disabled, dear. Leave the boxes, please. It hurts, doesn't it? Men like this are hard to find. Look, if you don't get back inside, I'll put the boxes back to the trunk. It's the last one! Come on in, and have a coffee with us. Not today, thanks. I'm in a bit of a hurry, but I can help you carry the boxes. No, there's no need, thank you. Well... - Take care of your hand. - It's nothing. They'll take it off tomorrow. You too take care. Take it easy. Thanks, huh? Can I come in? I found this. What is it? Open it, and you'll see. Where was it? Tucked away somewhere. I've put the batteries in. It works pretty well. Go on, try it. She sells seashells... - By the seashore. - By the seashore. She sells seashells... She sells seashells... - By the seashore. - By the seashore... - She sells seashells - See shells. By the seashore. No, dad... It has happened to you again. What? The voices. What voices? Well... You're not attending work. You've come to see me several times in a row after disappearing for a month. You move to my house. Suddenly you ask about the tapes. We both know something's wrong. Don't worry, mum. I'm fine, really. I cooked chickpea soup. Do you want some? I love chickpeas. If you want, we can swap rooms. You can stay in my room, It's only for a couple of days, mum. I'm not even unpacking. Don't rush to another place. to a student, 400 per month. I'd charge you less. You're feeling generous. That's me. - Hello? - Hi, it's your neurologist. Yes, sure. The sample you brought belongs to your mother, doesn't it? Yes, it was the right sample. It seems there's been a mistake. We should meet. Do I have to come? Can't you just tell me over the phone? I don't know if you have time right now. Yes, I can speak. It's about the saliva sample you brought us. - We just got the results from the lab. - OK. It doesn't match with your biological mother's swab. - Are the results conclusive? - They are conclusive, indeed. Sure, we'll talk about it next time I visit. Have you had any other outbreaks? No, nothing since the last one. - Good. See you at the appointment. - Alright. - Thanks. - Goodbye Something's wrong? It was the hospital. I can’t stop thinking about it ever since you've arrived. What are you doing here? I'm sleeping here, remember? But there's too much noise... You shouldn't be here. Sure... I've already noticed. Thanks for the heads up. This hasn't been planned. The guys from the platform suggested to celebrate the agreement and... You don't need to explain. I won't get mad. Why don't you go home? You could use some rest. Right? Alright. Whisky, please. New voicemail. Good evening. I'm calling from Sant Pau Hospital. We've admitted a woman at the ER, and she has given us your phone number. You should come to the hospital, please... To Sant Pau Hospital, please. Of course, don't worry, Marga. We'll take care of everything. Let me see your arm. I couldn't even take any clothes. - OK... - Nor the radio. - Tell my daughter to bring me the small one. - Sure! It's on the night-stand. You tell her yourself when she comes. Now, squeeze my hand... Very good... Squeeze my hand... And tell her to listen to the tape. Don't speak, Marga. Stay calm. Stay calm. Very good. Tell her to listen... These models are manufactured in ceramic, wood or metal. They are also available in marble and glass, but are significantly more expensive. This one is biodegradable. It's made of sand, saline and natural components. These are ecological. Great. It is different with coffins though. I think Marga was a beneficiary of a death insurance policy. Time to seed and time to harvest what's been sawn. "Family members only" Time to cry and time to laugh. Time to hug and time to refrain from hugging. Let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation. But deliver us... My condolences, my dear. She was a good woman. She'll be missed. My condolences. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry. Don't panic over the paperwork. My grandpa passed away last year, and it's not such a big deal once you get started. If you'd rather stay alone. I mean... I perfectly understand. You don't need to tell me anything. Just call me if you need anything, at least text me, nothing at all, okay? One, two, testing. One, two, three, testing. One, two, three, testing... Aaah. Testing. One, one. Oneeeee, one, two. One, two, testing. One, two, three, testing. MRI is clear. I've been going over your medical records. It doesn't help us much. No records before the age of eleven. And no genetic history... This clinic specializes in neurology. You would need to stay there for a week. They could monitor you, and run the tests we need. It would be very helpful if you agreed to be examined. Can you speak? Nope I'M OUT I'M OUT OF SYNC I HEAR THE PAST OF THE PLACES - Fuck! - Easy, easy, nothing happened... I'm sorry! EVEN IF I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE. DO YOU BELIEVE ME? Some people are not even workmates, they just come, work and they leave. I'm comfortable either way. Right... I mean, I can't have someone by my side who doesn't even look at me. I'm talking to them and they don't look at me in the eyes! - It's OK, there's too many of you. - No, but. Fuck! Easy, easy, nothing happened, really, I'll pick it up. - Are you OK? - Yes, just a small splash. - I'm so sorry. - Excuse me. - I'm a mess. - It's okay. I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE STUDIO JUST FOR 30 MINUTES. WAIT HERE. DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. Okay, let's see how you like this one... It was one of those days where everything goes right. I cleaned the house, and wrote two or three poems I liked. I couldn't ask for more. Then I went to the hallway to throw away the trash. And behind me, an airflow closed my door. I had no keys, and it was dark. I could hear my neighbours' voices behind their doors. It's transitory, I thought. But so can be death. A dark hallway. A closed door with the keys inside. And trash in one hand. It's a bit sad, isn't it? I don't know. I like it. Shall we go? One new text message. IVAN I'm at the door. Isn't that...? Yes, that's her. She looks well. - She's not well. - What's wrong with her? - She's not working. - How do you know? Because I called the studio and asked. Ah! You did? When? - On Thursday, I think... - Thursday. She's seen us. I asked you the other day, and you didn't say anything. She's coming towards us. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Glad to see you. Her name is Sara. It's fine, Sara. It's fine, my love... We have to get going. DATE: Thursday, November 5th; TIME: 9:13 DELAY: 1'45 "Intruder" Best Sound Design nomination And the winner is... Intruder! Good evening. Thank you so much. Ivan, you should speak. Good evening. I want to dedicate this award to the entire team. that made this project possible. And specially to one person, who could not be here tonight. But since I'm here, I wanted to tell her that it's a privilege to watch her work and to... IVAN Congratulations Sending IVAN Testing. One, two, one, two. I'll go ahead. I guess you're back from the bathroom. I hope so, otherwise all of this will be in vain. I imagine you're back at the table. And no, I'm not there... I thought we should better leave. Is it available? Yes, sure. No problem. You can take it. You will see two retired women who basically think I'm crazy. But let's stick to our business. We leave slowly, bit by bit. Ah, don't worry, everything’s been paid for. We exit the door and... Now we're both outside. Such a shame you can't see me right now, looking like an nutcase, talking to myself, but... I'll try not to laugh. Come on, let's keep going. Do you know the story about the blind man and the lame woman? Once there was a blind man and a lame woman who came to a river bank. There was no bridge, so they had to cross the river on foot. The lame woman said to the blind man: "Hey, we could cross here, but with only one leg, I'm not sure I can make it." And the blind man said: "I would cross if I could see, but I'm going to slip and drown for sure. The lame woman jumped on the blind man's back without hesitation. "You go ahead, and I will guide you", she said. And so they both were able to cross the river safe and sound. Oops! It's not this street. There we go, wait. It's the other street, I'm sorry. There we go, great. Just a little more... Here it is! Shall we go inside? Come on, let's go to the end of the hallway. And now just give me a second. - Hi, good afternoon. - Hello! - One? - Two, please. I'll take one, the other one will be picked up by a girl, who's tall, pretty... Very pretty. Quite rough, but she's nice, you'll see. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Okay, I'm back with you again. The screening has already started. Not sure about you, but I like to sit close to the screen. So? You just leave, like... Wait. Not even a coffee... Nothing! Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. Freezy breeze made these three trees freeze. Say that again. Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. We would never tell anyone. I guess this is recording. I know you won't tell me anything. I'm not capable of talking to you about this face to face. So I hope this will do. I know you're not alright, I'm sure the voices are back. It's best that at least you know what I know. I had three miscarriages. The last one left me unable to have any children. Your father was told... Remember the small rooms in the back, where the music was recorded? Well, we have refurbished it and... It doesn't have a projector, but it has new monitors. This is it. Small but cosy. This is the new machine. The latest version is installed. We've also changed the soundproofing. The technician said that the latency was practically zero. Looks good. So... Several projects are a bit urgent. Open that folder. That one is an industrial one. About warehouses. The one below is about the golden age of boxing in Barcelona. I love boxing. That's what I thought. The final mix is in stereo, right? Yes, stereo. Hello. Do you know what this is? Nooo. Micro. Cassette. Yes. Stripe! And now words that begin with a T. Tree. Make a sentence with this. R I don't know. Say it like this: Rrrrrrrrr Now tell me another word. - Ray! - Now another. RAY! Another one, come on. Ah, I thought no one was here. Hi. - How are you? - Fine. How come you are here? Hasn't Ivan told you? He might have told me. I don't know. Do you know where he is? No idea. Oh. Well. Happy to see you. Let's go. I want to know what happens in the studio, and I want it before you decide to bring her back. I was going to tell you, but... Yes, but you forgot, Ivan. That's what I'm telling you. How did you forget to tell me she was using the studio during the nights? If you want to be with her, take her to a hotel, OK? That's it! - I'll stop you there. - Stop me? Stop you, because we're talking about work. If this is about her pay, you can take it from my salary. - I mean it. I don't care! - It's not that. She's out of her mind, right? That girl is out of her mind. That cannot vary from day to day, Ivan. She's not out of her mind. If she leaves, I'm leaving too. I'm being so... Are you alright? Can you say that again? Are you alright? I'm better than ever. I guess this is recording. I know you won't tell me anything. I'm not capable of talking to you about this face to face. So I hope this will do. I know you're not alright, I'm sure the voices are back. It's best that at least you know what I know. I had three miscarriages. The last one left me unable to have any children. Your father was told that there was a family in a village... The girl had become pregnant from an orchestra musician. Or God knows who. They said she wasn't right in her head. She was hearing voices. She was not going to take care of the baby. Their parents decided to hide the pregnancy. Sorry, I'm going too fast. First, the name of the village. THANK YOU Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. Freezy breeze made these three trees freeze. Have I done it right? Alright. Once upon a time... Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. Made these three trees freeze. Three free fleas flew. Three free fleas flew. Hello? - Very good, good. - It hurts. Of course it hurts! Come on! Push, more, more. Come on! Come on, hold on! Come on... Come on! Push now! Come on! That's it! Very good! There! A girl, there you go. - Let me see her. - Just a bit. Let her see her. Let her go, we have to clean her! There she is. - How did it all go? - Alright. It's a girl and she's okay. Well, they are waiting downstairs. I'll handle it. - I'll clean her belly button, and I'll bring her back. - Alright. There is a bus stop nearby. So the house is quite well connected. OK, this is the upstairs. This is the living area... And here is where you could set up an office. My assistant told me you were planning to work from home, right? Most likely. I don't now when we'll get the fibre cable. But we should have it soon. That's what the company tells us. - This is another room. - Very good. And here... is the other one. As you can see, there is plenty of light. Oh, and I've already inquired about the subsidies, but I'm afraid they are only for families with children. That won't be a problem. There will be two of us. Let me see then. Or maybe three. Now we can go downstairs, and I'll show you the kitchen and the wash room. Please mind the stairs. This is the kitchen. It's practically empty. If you want, I can leave you alone for a moment, and you can think about it. - Great, thank you. - Very good.
