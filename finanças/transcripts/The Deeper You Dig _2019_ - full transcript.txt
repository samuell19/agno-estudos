- Hey beautiful. - Hi. I just gotta run to the store real fast, case we get snowed in. 'Kay. How was school? Fine. Miss Nichols says I can't wear dark lipstick anymore. You want me to go in and kick her ass? - Are we going hunting this weekend? - Mm-hmm. Remember, I'm gonna get my seventh in under twenty. I don't doubt it. Wanna go sledding tonight? Sure. Oh, wait, I got a session with Mrs. Minskey tonight. She still tryin' to talk to her dead husband? Yeah, but I'm gonna shake her out of a little more money before she gets to talk to him. That's cunty. I like it. Thank you. That's called business. Noted. All righty now, W.H.E.L. mountain radio, it's 7:16 and it's cold out there. Sub-zero temperature gonna be all night long with wind chill... What's goin' on, man? That's it? Stay safe out there folks, this storm is one for the record books... Twelve fifty. Stockin' up for the storm? Stay off the road, and let the road cleaners do their work. Drive safe out there. Mom, I'm gonna get a cinnamon coffee cake cappuccino. You want one? No, and you can't have one either. Why? Because you'll be up all night. Good, I'm gonna be sledding all night. No, I can't be at the bottom of the road to watch you. I got that session with Mrs. Minskey. And I know you have homework. Fuck homework. - Ah! - Ah! So, how we doin' over here? Lemme get another shot and a beer. What are we asking of the cards tonight, Mrs. Minskey? I'd like to know if my sciatica will ever go away. It hurts! Also, I'd like to know if my son is ever going to visit me. Maybe a phone call. But most of all, I'd like to speak to my beloved husband. My darling Ivan. Can we do that, please? Is that a good one or a bad one? Whispers from the shadows. Pass through the filament and pierce this earthly realm. Two hearts, once one, still yearn to shine. Bound by love, locked in time. Listen now and hear our calls. Show a sign within these walls. Ivan. Ivan Minskey? Are you there, Ivan? Can you hear us? Ivan, honey, I'm here. I'm here. Please, please won't you talk to us? The filament is thick. The veil won't part. Oh, Valley of Death.

So, that's perfect. Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go. All right, thank you. Bye. Hungry? Drink? - Water? - No. Sit. Nice place. Thanks to you. You taught me everything I know. I lost my sight. You lost your faith. I read your book. Times bestseller list, huh? How much of it was true? All of it. In the book it says that you were given the key to the Seven Circles. Is that true? Del, on the night that Echo disappeared, she reached out to me from the darkness. That's a mother's intuition. Maybe. But then she revealed to me a sign of the Seven Circles. And you know that has nothing to do with intuition. Please. The Seven Circles are unforgiving. They are locked in grief. They will warp everything within them. Every gift is its own twisted curse. And for you, who's turned her back on her calling, you will pay dearly. I'll pay. Whoever opens the box enters the Seven Circles. But it is not you who goes through them. It is they that go through you. Once the door's opened, it cannot be shut. What happens now? Listen, we just need to ask you a couple more questions, we're still at square one. Ivy, did Echo ever talk about being bullied at school? No. You don't have any reason to believe that she would have run away, do you? Echo did not run away. Something terrible happened to her. I know, because she reached out to me from another realm. I need you to help me find out what happened to her. But you can't help me find her. Only I can do that. Alone. Okay. Ivy, one last thing. You said you left Mrs. Minskey's at about nine that night? And the whole way home you didn't see any other cars. Nobody passed you? Okay, let's start from the beginning. You guys came home after shopping. What'd you get? What you buy? Did Echo buy anything? You made dinner, and then you left at about seven, right? Any boyfriend or girlfriend in the picture that you know of? Does she disobey you often? Do you think she would hurt herself? Do you happen to remember your conversation with her? I know you're not real. I'm as real as I am dead. I know you're not real. You're in my head. I'm not in your head yet. Why don't you go get your big gun and shoot me again?

What's goin' on buddy? Rockin' the mountains for over thirty-five years. You know, this Sunday we got a big charity, it's close to my heart and to yours. Am I right? It's for the Missing Children's Foundation. That's right, lotta kids go missing and are never found, and the parents are worried, so we wanna help them out, so we do a little charity event on Sunday... ...and is here on Kid California and much, much more. No beer tonight? It's gonna rock your world, and help those people... Cinnamon coffee cake cappuccinos. All right, we have a killer show for you tonight... Bye. Thanks for the extra marshmallows. So, the old house, how's the transformation coming? It's a struggle. So, what is this? Uh, I'm just... tryin' to find some answers. About your daughter? Oh, she's dead. You see, the cards are a projection of what we see, and what's hidden. And what wants to be seen. Shuffle. Hindsight. Insight. Foresight. The Devil. Don't worry, it's not always as bad as it seems. This card is basically about bondage. Something from your past, let's say, that still has a hold or sucks life from you. The High Priestess. That was Echo's favorite card. The authentic blueprint of our soul. Perfectly captures the duality in all of us. You see the two columns? Black, white, male, female. And then the veil that she's wearing, literally the thin veil between two worlds. Life and death, the visible and invisible. And then, of course, the crescent moon at her feet to remind us of the innate power of femininity. Cool. Yeah, it's cool. This is what's to come? Ten of swords. What? All is lost. Over and done. Dead. And yours is in reverse. What's that mean? Slow pain. But, look. You see that sun peeking out from behind the clouds? Yeah. Every end has a new beginning. At least that's what they say to make you feel better. They're just cards. I'm sorry, Kurt. I gotta piss. Where's your bathroom? Upstairs. Ah. I gotta go. What are we asking of the cards today, Miss Allen? I wanna talk to my daughter. I wanna talk to my beautiful Echo. Can we do that? Please? Is that a good one or a bad one? Whispers in the dark. Pass through the filament and pierce this earthly realm. Listen now and hear our calls, show a sign within these walls. Echo? Echo Allen? Are you there, Echo? Where the fuck are you? Echo, I'm here, honey. I'm here! Echo? Echo. Echo, talk to us, please. Please talk to us. Hmm. The veil is thick. It won't part. Please help me talk to my daughter. Please. Nothing. Tell my mother what you've done. Tell my mother what you've done. Give her peace. It was an accident. It coulda happened to anyone. And you shouldn't have been sledding in the dark. You shouldn't have been driving drunk. You might've had your eyes on the road. You might've known I wasn't dead. And you wouldn't have had to murder me. Get outta my head, kid. Or I'll kill your fucking mother. I'm Kurt. I'm Kurt. Shit. Fuck is that? Every morning, every evening Ain't we got fun? Not much money, oh, but honey Ain't we got fun? The rent's unpaid, dear We haven't a bus But smiles are made, dear For people like us In the winter, in the summer Ain't we got fun? Time's are bum and gettin' bummer Still we have fun There's nothing surer For people like us In the morning, in the evening Ain't we got fun? I can't wait. It's almost hunting season. You feelin' lucky? I'm feelin' deadly. How old were you when you started hunting? Eight. So, six seasons, six shots, six bucks. You got this year's tags yet? Come on, seven's the perfect number. It's got to be complete. Do you think deer know they're dying when they've been shot? Yeah. Sure. I don't. Animals don't know the difference between life or death. But when humans die, they know what they're gonna miss. Mom? Would you still love me if I murdered someone? I'll always love you. No matter what. Even if I killed someone you loved? Always. Hey, I carved you a pumpkin. Y'know, for Halloween. In case anybody came over I thought you might want... one. What? It just reminds me of Echo. She always used to carve a pumpkin, hoping trick-or-treaters would come but nobody comes up here. She really loved this time of year. Halloween... then hunting season. What more could a Goth kid ask for? - You takin' a walk? - Yeah, just a little mental homework. Fuck homework. Thanks, Kurt. - Hey. - Hey. I was just... There's really good hunting behind your house. That was Echo's favorite spot. I don't really like goin' alone. You wanna go? Go hunting? Do you hunt? Yeah. I'd love to. I... I just got a shotgun though, uh, and no tags. I got an open tag. Lemme get my hat and my gun and we'll go. It's cold. Last year, Echo bagged a buck out here in under thirty minutes. Nice. She said this year she was aiming for under twenty. Alright, I can do it. Oh yeah? Sure. Let's split up and find out. Oh, fuck. Snuck up on that pretty fast. What're you, some kinda ghost? That's seven. It's complete. What'd you just say? Kurt. Hey wait! Hey wait! Hold on! Hold on! Stop for a second. Stop for a second. Did you hear that? That echo? I've never heard an echo in these woods. And in the snow. I'm almost here. What? I'm... I'm almost here. Kurt. I'm Kurt. I'm Kurt. Mom? I love you. Candles glowing, shadows throwing, cards ready, ever knowing. A mockery I made of thee. Blind no more, I choose to see. I swallow whole the worm of shame, and turn my nature towards the flame. My purpose to the truth affixed, I call upon the Circle Six. I turn a card; I beg it shows... the secrets that my daughter knows. Oh! Ha-ha-ha! Detective Sanford, it's Ivy Allen. I think I have some information on Echo's killer. I know, I know, but, I know she's dead. Because I'm her mother and I know. Because I've seen things. Signs she's been sending me. And then the cards last night, I... I pulled the High Priestess card, that's Echo. And then I pulled the Devil card, that's him! That's my... Yeah. Okay. Hi. Ow. Echo. It was an accident. She never should've been sledding in the dark. Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! That was cunty, and I like it. But... Oh my God. Don't pull it... don't pull it out! - But it hurts. - Don't pull it out! There's so much blood. Echo? Mom. Come closer. Echo. Come here, please. Ow! We won. I made it just how you like it. Extra marshmallows.
