"Dear Amelia: "Reading your column has assured me I'm not alone. "It gets me through the day. "But at night, when I try to close my eyes, "the fear consumes me. "How do I end this? "Signed, Embarrassed." - "Dear Embarrassed: "I admire your courage and pray for your safety. "You must find a way to leave someway, somehow. "Surviving is the start of your journey. "Living is the finish line. Never back down." "Dear Amelia: "Your words continue to give me strength. "I need to get out, but feel trapped. "Signed, Embarrassed." - "Dear Embarrassed: My heart goes out to you. "I know how hard it is, but you must go to the police. "There are support systems in place to help you. "Your husband should never lay a hand on you again." - "Dear Amelia: Going to the police is too dangerous. "What do I do to stop this?" - "Dear Embarrassed: "The answer to your question is both simple and difficult: "Whatever it takes." - What are you doing? I don't believe this. It doesn't matter what I do. You just keep pushing me and pushing me to do things that I don't wanna do. - You can't do this. It's not right. - Don't you tell me what's right! - What are you doing? Threatening me? - I'm done making threats. - What's that supposed to mean? Put it down, Trevor. Put it down, Trevor. Put it down. - What are you gonna do about it? - Sometimes, when we go through a traumatic experience, the fears that linger are undetectable, even to ourselves. And we need to take a step back and remember what it was like before. Who we were before. Before you lost your job, before the death in the family, before you caught him cheating, before the violence. I wanna thank all of you for coming. It gives me hope knowing that our shared experiences can bring strength. We learn from our past, we refuse to let it define our present and we build our own future. Never back down. Thank you. - I just wanna say thank you. Your column guided me through the worst. And you're my touchstone every morning. - Thank you. It works both ways. Your appreciation gives me my strength. - You should write a book. - Actually, I just started a blog. It's called Never Back Down. You know, it'd be great to have some more strong voices on the site. - Count me in. - The link's on the bottom. What's your name? - Jenny Reardon. - It's nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. There's just something else I need to tell you. Um, I'm Embarrassed. - Please don't be. I'm here to listen. - No. I'm Embarrassed. - My God! - To the cover girl. - It's no big deal. - Yes, it is. This is what you've been working for. - What we've been working for. - I think we need to capitalize on the attention. I know you're busy with your speaking gigs, but the blog is your future. Look. Here is a list of email addresses who have created a member profile. And here is a list of people who have actively posted. It's 92%. That's unheard of in this industry. The problem is nobody else knows it exists. - I'm not sure the newspaper would want me to drive people away from my column. - Well, screw the Sentinel. Nobody wants to get ink on their hands. I can get you primo placement on the search engines. - For a shoestring budget? - Don't get me wrong. If you gave me $2 million, I could spend it. I could spend it better than any other search-engine optimizer, and I'd still get you better placement on a Web search. A few structural tweaks on your site, maximize keyword density... OK, bottom line is, if anybody needs help or advice, the first site they will see is Never Back Down. All you have to do is give me the go-ahead. What do you have to lose? - All right, let's do it. - Yes! - It is pretty cool. - I'm up for that. - Thank you. - Thanks. - To you. - Hottie at 9:00 is checking you out. - I doubt it. My God! - I told you. - You made me look there. - Well, who says that you should meet new people and not shut yourself off from relationships? That's right. You. - OK. - Meeting guys in a bar, it's never a good idea. - And you met Darryl at a bookstore in the home-and- garden section. - Good point. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. I shouldn't have said that. - Darryl? Forget it. He's locked up for 2 more years. - Ooh, he's coming over. You'd better get ready, girl. - My gosh! - I'm sorry to bother you, but I noticed you looking my way and laughing. I couldn't help but find out what's so funny. - I don't remember talking about him, do you? - We were talking about gardening. - I know what you said. I can read lips. - You're bluffing. - Your name is Amelia. That's a pretty good trick. - I've got another one. All I need is your phone number. - Nice try, but I'm not in the habit of giving my phone number out to a guy I've just met for the first time. - Do you know what every great love story has in common? - No, what? - At one point, they also met for the first time. - Thank you for coming. I look forward to hearing from each and every one of you online. It gives me hope knowing that our shared experiences can bring strength. We learn from our past, we refuse to let it define our present and we build our own future. And as always, never back down. Thank you. Bravo! Thank you. - Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Hi! - Hi. - Were you here the whole time? - And loved every minute of it. Even the Q & A. They didn't wanna let you leave. - I hope you weren't charging me by the hour. - Of course not, kiddo. I take my 5% off the top. Speaking of which, I have something big in the works. - In the works? As in Modern Media Works? - Now, don't jinx it for us. Just let me do my thing. But when the time is right, I'll need you to win over a tougher crowd. I have to go, but I'll call you in the morning, OK? - OK, thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Party on the 15th floor. They've been holding it up all day. We met a while ago at the bar. - I remember. - I've been back there a couple of times hoping to see you again. - I don't have much of a social life these days. - I know. You work too hard. I found your site. It posts your event schedule. - Look, I'm not into these kinds of games. - I wanted to see you again, so here I am. No games. Listen, probably not the best idea showing up here unannounced, but that still doesn't take away from the fact that I'd like to take you out. In case you lost the first one. Call me. - My gosh! Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. - I've just been working the room. Where else? More importantly, who was that you were talking to? - Remember Romeo from the bar? - Get out of town! What happened? - He wants me to call him. - So call him. Set a date. Go out. Take charge! Come on, isn't that your motto? - No, dating is the last thing on my mind right know. - OK, so you're gonna check in with me 3 times a day by phone: 9:00 a.m, 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. My number is at the bottom of the page. When you check in with me at nighttime, that means you're in for the night, no exceptions. You got that? You're gonna start to look for a job. If you need assistance in finding a job, we have a placement program. That's what we're there for. Just basically make sure you stay out of trouble and keep your nose clean at all times. You understand exactly what I'm telling you, Mr. Devine? Is it clear? - Perfectly. - There you go. - Ciao, this is Carlo Rossi. Please leave me a message after the tone. - Hi, this is Amelia from the bar and the conference. Um, how about dinner tomorrow night? - I know a little place in Beacon Hill. -00? Let me know if that works for you. My number is 202 555-0152. - Detective Wilson. - You keep telling me to call you Hank and then you call yourself Detective Wilson. - Hey, I never know who's behind the door. - This is a pleasant surprise. How's the family? - They're great. Our youngest one is off to college at the end of summer. I'm hoping to spend a couple of weeks with him up at the lake, but you know, with all the work... - Still putting in 14-hour days? - Please give my regards to Cindy. - Will do. - What's the matter, Hank? - I wish I had better news for you, Amelia. Darryl's been released. - When? - Last Thursday. Paperwork just got on my desk today. I came straight over. - I know this isn't your fault, but how is this possible? - State's broke. I've been in domestic abuse for over 20 years, and this is the worst I've ever seen it. All the cutbacks, overcrowding. And for some reason, domestic-abuse offenders are the first ones to receive a get-out-of-jail-free card. - Great, so how am I supposed to feel safe? - Look, I made sure the restraining order was in effect. - What? - One slip-up on his part and he's right back in prison. - That's if you can catch him. You can't protect me 24/7, Hank. - I'm gonna be checking in with his parole officer every day. Amelia. Amelia! He's not gonna hurt you again. - I have a confession. I read your blog. It's fascinating. So raw and emotional. - I don't edit my words. I write what I feel. And lately, I've been... - Venting. Sorry, I didn't mean to... - No, I'm the one who should apologize. It's been a long week, and I'm not very good company right now. - You could talk to me. - My ex-husband Darryl was just released from prison. Listen, I know that I invited you, but.... - No, no, please. I understand. No, let me. - I insist. - You must promise me 2 things. Next time, I pay. And even though we both have our cars, you'll let me see you home. - I'd appreciate that. "False starts. One must take all the time one needs. "Healing works on its own schedule, not yours. "False starts and setbacks "are part of the long hard road to recovery." - Miss Davis, Miss Frankel, a pleasure to finally meet you both. Colin Grosslight. - Hi. - Please follow me. The team is eager to meet you. In this business, there's a small window to turn a spark into a flame. Your audience is small but growing. And if you want this to become more than a niche blog, you're gonna need our help. - A niche blog? Marginalizing Amelia's audience is condescending and frankly not the best way to start off a new partnership. - That is not our intent. We know the numbers are strong given the circumstances. And we love the demo. We wouldn't be sitting here otherwise. And the women who read your blog trust you, and that is invaluable to us. - And to your advertisers. - We already have the majors ready to commit. Just say the word. - Slow down. What about content? - We don't care what you write as long as people are reading. - And clicking every now and then. - Jody, right? - Right. - I'm guessing you haven't been vocal in the meeting because you didn't work on these mock-ups. - I reviewed them, but no, I didn't work on them. - So she's here because you think another woman in the room will make me feel more comfortable? - I know all about your blog. - You have a small window to impress a prospective client. That window is about to close. What do you think of the presentation? - There's a visual flair that's familiar, but it's--it's missing your imprint. - I think it's a Carrie Bradshaw rip-off. I'll be back next week to hear your pitch. And by the way, it's one butterfly. - Well, there's no sign of forced entry. We'll ask the neighbours if anyone saw something, but so far, we've got nothing. Have you received any threatening messages lately? Maybe on your computer? - This is obviously Darryl. - Well, Darryl is the most likely suspect. If it is him, we know that he'll slip up eventually. But the problem is that you've become a public figure, Amelia. And we can't ignore the possibility that this attack might be connected to the blog. - I highly doubt that. - Well, obsessed fans, angry husbands. I just wanna make sure that we look into all the possibilities here. - So you're basically telling me that I have to be afraid of everybody? - Is your address listed anywhere? - No, I don't ever give it out. - What about neighbours? Have you had any disputes recently? - I pretty much keep to myself. - Is there anyone new in your life? - We went on one date. He seems like a really nice guy. I just... I can't imagine that he would do something like this. - Well, it won't hurt to check him out. And if you don't mind, I'm gonna have the tech guys from the station look into your Web site. See if that leads to anything. Hey, we're gonna catch this guy. - You know I'm not gonna answer a thing without my lawyer. - Yeah well, the problem with lawyers is they cost money. And, um, by the look of this place, you'd be best off talking to me yourself. - You look old, Detective. - I'd look even older if you'd spent the whole 5 years in prison. - I'm not saying I was a choir boy, but I didn't deserve all that time. And losing Amelia was enough of a punishment. - Losing Amelia? - Yeah. - And when exactly was that? Was that before or after you threw her down a flight of stairs? Or maybe it's the time you put her in the hospital with your fists. It's too bad I don't hand out the sentences. - Tough guy with your badge and your piece. Truth is you couldn't protect her then. And from the looks of things, you can't protect her now. - I'm watching you, Devine. I'm watching every move you make. - Are we done here? - Thanks for having me. I just couldn't stay there until the alarm was in. - Don't mention it. I could use the company. This'll make it more comfortable. - Thanks. - How about some tea? - Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Do you think it was Darryl? - I don't know who else it could be. After he hit me the first time... I knew when it was coming. When he was drinking... or when we'd argue. But this is different. Not knowing when or where it might happen again. But it's like that feeling in the pit of my stomach is the same. Does that make any sense? - Yeah. - And what bothers me most is how everything I feel I've worked so hard for can be taken away like that. - No one can take away what you've achieved or the progress you've made. - How did you do it? How did you fight back? - It was a long road. Martial arts taught me some self-confidence, but... it wasn't until I started writing you that I realized there's a possibility of a better life. One day, I just snapped. It didn't feel real until I saw the blood. That changed everything. - I'm not sure I can do it. - You fought back. You did it once and you can do it again. We don't even know who it is that's doing this. But whoever it is, you're strong enough to do whatever it takes. - I'm just not sure that I have that kind of courage anymore. - Neither was I. But you were there for me. And now I'm there for you. - Thanks. I needed that. - Thanks. Mr. Rossi. - Yes? - I have a few questions for you. This shouldn't take long. - Is this about my work visa? I renewed it through the mail. - No. - Well then, what can I help you with, Officer? - Actually, it's Detective. - Please come in. - I need to know your whereabouts this past Wednesday evening. - Why? - I'll ask the questions, Mr. Rossi. - Wednesday. I was at Dusty's Bar. I was meeting someone at 5:00. It lasted about an hour. I stayed after he left. - You stayed until what time? Not sure. 10:00 maybe. - Maybe's are no good for me. I need you to be sure. Yes, 10:00. - And who were you with? - The meeting was with some potential clients. I stayed afterwards for a burger and a beer. - You stayed by yourself? - I ate at the bar. I'm a regular there. - Can anyone corroborate your story? - I'm sure the bartender can. - You got a name for me? - I can't remember who was working that night. I think it was Meagan. - Can you at least tell me what this is all about? - Amelia Davis. She was attacked last Wednesday night. - My God! Is she all right? You think it was me. - Just asking questions, Mr. Rossi. I'll be in touch. Meagan, I gotta ask you a few questions. Were you working here last Wednesday night? - Wednesday's my night off. The manager saves me for the weekends. - So who was working? - Dave. He's the manager. - I'm trying to get some information on this individual. - Carlo. - How well do you know him? - Enough to tell you his name. What's this about? - I'm conducting a criminal investigation. - He's in here a couple of times a week. - Does he pay cash, credit card? - Credit card. Every time. - I'm gonna need to see your receipts from Wednesday night. - I only swipe the card. Dave takes care of the rest. He's in at 6:00. - Well then, you get Dave to give me a call, OK? - Will do. - We wanna brand Amelia as the next Oprah... uniting and inspiring women of all kinds. Your words will comfort them. Your message will empower them. They can read the blog from the workplace... keep your book next to their bed, listen to your podcast on their iPod and, if things progress as we expect, they'll soon be watching your TV show. Never Back Down will be the place women go when they feel threatened or feel like they've lost control. You will help them get back to who they were. - Look, I get your personal interest in this case. But like I told you over the phone, I don't see anything unusual with... - Devine. Darryl Devine. - Devine. Thank you. - Look, Amelia Davis was attacked in her home, and Devine is our prime suspect. You wouldn't be breaking any rules. I just want the same information you have. That's all. - What day are you looking at? - For starters, Wednesday the 7th. Don't you put your log-ins in the computer? - To tell you the truth, I'm a little bit behind here on my data entry. So just give me a second and I'll... Here, what'd you say? Wednesday the 7th. - Devine, check-in time: 9:00 p.m. It's all there. - In person? - Why in person? Listen, I have over 150 open cases here. The only guys who need to show their face are murderers or serial rapists. Now, unless Devine fails a drug test or even gets into a little bit of trouble, all he has to do is phone it in. That's the way we do things around here. - This guy was one punch away from making that cut, OK? Now, he knows how to manipulate the system. So if he's as much as 2 minutes late in checking in, I'd like to get a call, OK? - OK. - Thanks. - I got them up to $450 a year for 3 years, guaranteed. Plus the signing bonus-- $1.3 million. - The money isn't the issue. - I thought you liked the presentation. - I did. I did. They have a vision. It's not exactly my vision, but it's bigger and it could be better. - So then what's holding you back? - Book tours, corporate-speaking engagements. Me on TV. It's just a lot to think about. - Look, I know you're worried about selling yourself out, but this is an opportunity of a lifetime, Amelia. And I don't mean the money. You'll have a platform to reach millions of people and really touch their lives. A bigger audience won't change who you are. - I just need some time to think. - Sure. But don't take too long. These companies have a very short attention span. - OK. - Are you OK about going home alone? - Yeah, I need to practise what I preach, right? Go back to the life I know. Excuse me. Hello? - Hey, Amelia. If you have a moment, can you drop by? -I'm on my way. - Thanks. - Everything OK? - Yeah, I'll call you later. - Darryl's been walking the straight line. He's been checking in regularly with his parole officer and staying out of trouble. But he still has no alibi for the night of the attack. - Can you arrest him? - No, I need something concrete. You know I'd bring him in if I could. I also talked with Carlo Rossi. He said he was at Dusty's Bar that night. Bartender doesn't remember specifics, but his card was run twice: 5:36 p.m. and 7:04 p.m. Now, you said the attack took place at 6:45 p.m. - Yeah. - It's 6 miles between Dusty's Bar and your place, so I don't think Carlo's our guy. - It's Darryl, I'm telling you. - Yeah well, if it is, he's gonna slip up and we'll get him. - Bernice, make the deal. - I won't waste any time. It's with great pride we welcome Amelia Davis into the Modern Media Works family and letting us be her megaphone. - I have to confess. I had my doubts about selling. I wasn't even sure it was mine to sell. And then I remembered why I wrote my first column. Because I was scared and alone. Well, I'm not alone anymore. I look forward to collaborating with Modern Media Works and their talented marketing team. And together, I hope we can reach more women, making sure that they never have to feel scared or alone ever again. Thank you. - Very nice. - I guess you don't need me anymore. - Yeah, I--I wanted to talk to you about that. The blog needs a writer for a weekly article on self-defence. I know you're used to working for free, but this one's a paying job. - Thank you. - You didn't think I'd leave you behind, did you? - I'm worried. - What are you doing here? - The police questioned me about an attack. You don't return my phone calls. - I've been busy. - I understand, but I still deserve to know what's going on. Do you really think I could've attacked you? - I'm sorry. They asked me who was new in my life. I didn't think that you did it, but I barely know you. - That's not my fault. - I'm sorry. - You're forgiven. Now, if my memory serves me right, you owe me a make-up date. I said yes when you asked. Is that a yes? - Stop following me. - You're too fast for me anyway. - Coming! - You look incredible. - So do you. - I know you suggested that place in Beacon Hill, but I had something different in mind. - OK, sounds great. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Where did you learn so much about produce? - My mother. She loved to cook. And I was an only child, so she taught me. Close your eyes. Now breathe in. - What do you smell? - It's peppery, a little like black licorice. - Good. - Now what? - Now we take it home. - Why did you leave Italy? - My father remarried. Our family was broken. I wanted to start over, be invisible. - I can relate to that. - Why did you stay... after he went to jail? I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. - No, it's OK. I thought about moving back to San Francisco. The ocean. The fog. I love it there. My parents practically begged me to come back home. But something just didn't feel right. Like my experience here wasn't finished, you know? Will you come with me to this benefit Friday night? I know that I'm the one who keeps making the plans. I hope you're comfortable with that. - I have plans for us, too. I'd love for you to see Italy. The food, the architecture. Shopping. I would love to take you there. - I've heard the summer is nice. Does this mean you'll come Friday night? ♪♪Feel the energy ♪ ♪ Electricity ♪ Caress my body ♪ Touch me 'cause I want it, baby ♪ ♪ I know you want me ♪ I know you want, I know you want me ♪ ♪ I know you want me ♪ I know you want ♪ I know you want me ♪ I know you want me ♪ I know you want, I know you want me ♪ ♪ I know you want me, I know you want ♪ ♪ I know you want me♪♪ Miss Davis! - Hi. - Hi. Not bad? - Yeah. - Perfect location for people watching. - Thank you. This one. Thank you. - So where's your date? - He's on his way. - Good, so you have time to spill. - We had a good time. - You blog endlessly about your most intimate feelings, and "we had a good time" is the best you can do? Come on, I'm living vicariously through your love life right now. - Ask me again after I've had a few drinks. That's more like it. Cheers.! - I'm so sorry. I can't believe I just did that. - Don't worry. Just a little water and it'll come right out. I'll be right back. - Wow! Still a looker. Nice. - What's this all about, Darryl? - I'm not here to hurt you. I just want my cut. I know you're making millions from this deal. You know what I got out of it? That cop of yours tracking my every move. Reporters knocking on the door of my trashy studio hole to get an exclusive of the scumbag who turned you into a poor wounded puppy. Calling my work nonstop. I even got fired. Did you know that? - That's not my fault. I'm not giving you anything. - You're gonna listen to me for once. I paid my debt to society. Now it's your turn to pay. You have no idea how much I loved you. - You sure knew how to show it. - Never your fault, right? I hope you reconsider. - How is it possible that, with all of these people here, nobody saw him? - We showed his picture to every single person. No luck. Hopefully, the surveillance cameras caught him going in and out. And he'll be where he belongs: behind bars. - How long is that gonna take? - Once I can put him at the scene, he'll be in custody within the hour. In the meantime, I suggest you stay somewhere safe. - Good morning, bella. - Good morning. - How did you sleep last night? - Great, thanks. And thanks for giving me space. I haven't had a good night's sleep since Darryl's been out. Thank you. - Have a seat. Any messages? - No. - Whatever you wanna do today, we do. - Anywhere with fresh air. - Do you have ketchup? - You do not eat ketchup with these eggs. - Is that truffle? - It is. Do you still want ketchup? - I love ketchup. I'm sorry. - Americani! You pollute your own plate, not mine. Bernice. Hey, listen, can I call you back? I'm in the middle of something. - This can't wait. We're being sued. - Ladies, Mr. Cross, I believe both our parties are here for the same thing: a quick and uncomplicated resolution to this matter. - This matter got complicated the moment your client filed this frivolous lawsuit. - My client's character has been repeatedly attacked in Ms. Davis' blog. I thought we were here to negotiate. Obviously, I was wrong. - What are you proposing? - We believe $3 million is a fair number. - That's ridiculous! - That's our offer. Considering the circumstances, I would suggest your client seriously think about it. - Circumstances? You have to be kidding me. You barely have a case. We'll see you in court. - Suit yourself. I'm sure a jury will find Ms. Davis' choice of company... quite interesting. This has to be a mistake. - The mugshot looks real to me. I just don't know the specifics of the crime yet. That's all. - You said he had a clean record. - Well, nothing came up on my database. So I put a call in to my FBI contact, asked him to look into Interpol. And this is what he found. - I finally meet someone I like. - Have you spoken to him again yet? - No. I cancelled our date for tonight. - Good. I want you to stay away from him until we know exactly what he's hiding. - What about Darryl? - The hotel's sending tapes in this afternoon. They had 15 active security cameras working that day, so I've assigned 2 guys to go through them. As soon as I find something, Amelia, I'll give you a call. - OK. Thanks. - Yeah. Amelia, what were you thinking? - I know it was stupid. - You're just lucky they didn't see you. - Well, at least I know the truth. - Yeah, well, there's more. 'Cause while you were out playing private eye, I got a call from my contact in Italy. Carlo Rossi has no arrest record. But under the name of Carlo Mancini, he was arrested on 4 accounts of fraud and extortion 4 years ago. All charges were dropped. - How come? - Well, as it turns out, Carlo's family owns some major real estate in Naples. They have a lot of influence out there. The guy I spoke to didn't even wanna talk about it on the phone. So I'm gonna be calling the investigating officer later tonight to get some more information. I even put a call in to Homeland Security to find out the condition of his work visa. - God, I feel so stupid! - It wasn't your fault. - He and Darryl must've been planning this the whole time. - Look, you just gotta promise me that you'll stay far away from this guy, OK? Until after we sort this whole thing out. I have the paperwork for a restraining order for you. - You know what works better than a restraining order? A gun. - Look, Amelia, you have to understand that a gun is not a way of reclaiming power or striking back. I mean, a gun's a means of defending yourself when there's no other alternative. You understand that? - I don't wanna rely on some judge to protect me. Now that I know who it is, I can protect myself. It's impossible to feel safe and protected all the time. In one way or another, we are all vulnerable. Those that we let in know where we hurt the most, our worst fears, our insecurities. Hi, I'm not here to take your call right now. Please leave me a message. Those who want to get in but can't look for cracks in our armour. - But is your investigation on Carlo Mancini... Is it still ongoing? Yes. Yes, I would appreciate receiving a copy of the file. -But it is how we deal with our vulnerabilities that we define our strengths and our weaknesses. And while I know I can't change the past, I believe that being a victim is a state of mind. I am going to change my state of mind. "Never back down" is only the beginning. The end is when we are confident, secure in who we are, able to defend ourselves. Defamation of character? Intentional infliction of emotional distress? This is all lies! - From a legal standpoint, they're gonna lose. But I've been up against Lana Grey before, and she'll take this to the end just to keep seeing herself on TV. Pictures of you with a convict won't go over well with your audience or with the advertisers, even if this was all a setup. - This is my private life. I didn't do anything wrong. - No, but that doesn't matter in the court of public opinion. If you lose your credibility, you lose everything. Modern Media Works is willing to pay all the money for this to go away quietly. It won't cost you a thing. - Yes, it will. I'm tired of being pushed around. -My papers are in order. I still don't know what you want from me. - It says here you're a lying thief who extorts grieving women for money. - This is out of your jurisdiction. And all those charges against me were dismissed. - Tell me something. What's your involvement with Darryl Devine? - I'm not talking without my lawyer. - 'Cause you 2 guys seem to have a lot in common. You know what I think? I think you read about Ms. Davis' upcoming payday and you thought to yourself: "Easy score." - That's a lie. - We know all about your family back in Italy. Portfolio's not what it used to be, is it? So what have we got so far? You've got a history of taking advantage of women for money. You conveniently pop up out of nowhere just when Miss Davis is about to sell her blog. You've been seen associating with her ex-husband who just so happens to be suing her right now and using you for leverage. I mean, that's a pretty tight fit isn't it? One phone call to immigration about a potential extortion on US soil and neither Carlo Rossi or Carlo Mancini will ever set foot in this country again, you got that? - Federal crimes, out of your jurisdiction. - Jurisdiction. Yeah, I know. I know, I know. You keep reminding me. For an innocent man, you sure seem to know an awful lot about the judicial system. - I came to this country to start over again. That's why I changed my name. It has nothing to do with you. - And that's where you're wrong. Because when it comes to Miss Davis' security, it has everything to do with me. -I was trying to protect her! - How? By plotting with her abusive ex-husband to extort her? -I tried to pay him off, all right? So he would leave her alone. It's you, Wilson. You who can't protect her. She's in danger, and I'm trying to keep her safe. - I'll be keeping an eye on you, Carlo. - Isn't that what you told Darryl? - It was like I was looking at a complete stranger. - You couldn't have known. - But I should have. When things went bad with Darryl, I was young, naive. Now I know what people are capable of and I still opened myself up to this. - So you took a chance on someone. - I barely knew him. I just can't trust anyone. - If you'd have shut yourself off after Darryl, you never would've gotten your life back on track. You never would've started the blog. You never would've met me. - I know you're right. I'm just so frustrated that I've allowed these guys to affect me. I'm tired of feeling victimized. - What about the lawsuit? - The thought of them walking away with one cent makes me sick. - Whose decision is it? - Mine. But Modern Media Works can terminate my contract. - Well, that won't happen. - At this point, I don't care about the job or the blog or the money. Darryl and Carlo think that they can exploit me. - Is there anything I can do? - Can you stay over tonight? - Of course. - This is early for you, Bernice. - Amelia, turn on the TV. -What channel? - 97. - Look, I paid for my crimes. But this media pressure, this hounding has--has caused extreme emotional stress on me. - My God! -All this because of Amelia Davis, media darling. What's excessive is the vindictive and unjust way that I've been treated. It's not about the money. It's about justice and doing what's right. -Please tell me what happened. - What the hell does this mean, Bernice? - Scare tactics. But it worked. Modern Media Works wants to settle. - No way. -Don't worry. Grosslight has deep pockets. - I don't care. Let them try to take this to court. Let them release the photos. But I'm not agreeing to anything. - OK. I'll call you when I know more. - OK. - My God! I feel like my life is completely out of my hands. Wilson called. He said that they caught Darryl on the surveillance tapes. - That's fantastic! When can they arrest him? - The DA needs to sign off on the warrant. But it shouldn't be long. I really need to get out of the city for a while. - What about that spa you sent me to last year for my birthday? - Yeah, now you're talking. That's exactly what I need. - What we need. - You'll go with me? - You don't think I'd let you go anywhere alone, do you? - Thank you. I think somebody's following us. - Probably just a coincidence. - It's Carlo! - He's coming. - Pull over! - Leave me alone! - Pull over! I need to talk to you. - Careful! - Amelia! Pick up your cell phone! Amelia! - Leave me alone! - Pick up the phone! - How is he? - It doesn't look good. We had to let him go after the interrogation. We didn't have enough to hold him on. - I just wanna go home. - So anyway, it was pretty interesting. There she is! She's coming back. Get her, get her. Here she comes. Ms. Davis, Ms. Davis! What is your relationship with Mr. Mancini? Are you romantically involved? Amelia, have the police laid any charges? - She has no comment. Leave her alone. - Ms. Davis! Can you make any comment? - Amelia! Amelia! Amelia, one more question! - I'll take the couch. - This just came in. You better take a look at it. - No wonder they didn't prosecute. The whole case was frivolous. Seems like the women were the ones trying to shake him down. - Based on these bank statements, I can see why. - Yeah. - But his money won't help him now. - Thanks. -Hello? - Amelia, I have some news about Carlo. - No questions, but I have a statement. I had a relationship with Carlo Mancini that ended because I chose to believe information that turned out to be untrue. I pray Carlo recovers and that I will get the chance to speak with him again, to apologize for doubting him. But I will not apologize to my ex-husband, whose allegations against me are just another attempt at intimidation. Abuse disguises itself in many forms. It can be physical or psychological. It feeds on our insecurities and aims to strip us of our identity and self-worth. But I know who I am and I know who you are, Darryl. You are a selfish, arrogant, pathetic excuse for a human being. And if you wanna up your lawsuit for defamation because I said that, go right ahead. Because no matter what you threaten to do, I will never back down. Thank you. - One question. What about the lawsuit? Are you in love with him? Amelia! - Amelia! - Ms. Davis! - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. - What have you got? - That warrant you want for Darryl Devine? - Yeah. - DA just signed it. - I want 4 uniforms at Darryl Devine's place immediately. - OK. - Possible take down. Police! Open up, Mr. Devine! Yeah, it's me. He's gone. Put out an APB on him and his truck. - OK. Thanks, Hank. I appreciate it. Darryl's on the loose again. - It never ends. - You went out? - Yeah, there's a horde of reporters out there. Your TV appearance made everything worse. - My God! This is getting ridiculous. - You're coming home with me. - They're just gonna follow us. - I'm ahead of you. I put my car in the back. - It can be physical or psychological. It feeds on our insecurities and aims to strip us of our identity and self-worth. But I know who I am and I know who you are, Darryl. You are a selfish, arrogant... - ... excuse for a human being. - Bitch! -If you wanna up your lawsuit because I said that, go right ahead. Because no matter what you threaten to do, I will never back down. Thank you. - Every time I try to relax... - Who is it? - It's Bernice. - Voice mail. - Bernice, what's up? - After your TV performance, the server went nuts from all the traffic. Shut the whole thing down. It's back up again, though. - Were the responses good or bad? - Your fans are showering you with love. - What about Darryl and the lawsuit? - Modern Media Works is backing you 100%. They don't want to settle. Darryl is a footnote. - That's fantastic! - It gets better. I've had 50 calls for interview requests. And I don't mean affiliates. I'm talking the ones that go by one name. And Random House wants the book rights. - This is unbelievable! - Call me in the morning. We'll strategize. - OK, thank you. - So? - Darryl is out of luck on all fronts. - Modern Media Works took its settlement offer off the table? - For good. - Things are looking up for you, girl. - I feel like I wanna write something on the blog. Do you mind if I go upstairs? - Sure. - OK. Every instance of abuse has 2 victims. The second is trust. When the person you trusted more than anyone turns on you and destroys that trust, you think you will never let anyone in ever again. I've recently allowed myself to have faith in someone. For the first time in a long time, I can say... "I have a friend and I trust her." - I need a beer. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - The lawsuit is dead. - Shhh! One more step and you're dead. - Put it down. - You're not gonna screw this up for me. - For you? I thought we were in this together. We were supposed to get our sweet Amelia. - We were. But then the boyfriend got in the way. - So what do we do now? - Like you said, the lawsuit's dead. So are you. "Dear Amelia: Your words have given me courage. "She has pushed me around too long. "I was embarrassed... "Because my abuser is my wife. "But tonight... "I stand up for myself. "Tonight, I tell her that it is over. "I am leaving her for good. "Thanks for guiding me through the hurt. "Trevor." - Hey, what are you doing? I thought you were working. - It was all a lie, wasn't it? You were never Embarrassed. Trevor was. - He certainly was an embarrassment. - You were the one abusing him. - I knew I should've thrown this away. I just couldn't. - Everything that you've ever told me was a lie. - Talk about the pot calling the kettle. Your entire life is a concoction. - Wait. - You're not a hero. You're a coward who hides behind her keyboard and a mouse. - My God! - You let Darryl push you around? -You should've done that years ago. - I'm not a killer. - No, you're not. You're a victim. - I trusted you. - You are also a very bad judge of character. - What did I ever do to you? - You ruined my life. So I pushed Trevor around a little. It worked for us. We were happy. And then he started reading your garbage. "Never back down." What a joke! Got him all fired up. - What are you doing? - So you believe that garbage? - Yes. This is it. This, this is it. We're through. - So this is it. This is your big stand. You don't have the balls to fight back? - You don't know what I'm capable of. - Unfortunately, Trevor, I know exactly what you're capable of. Put it down, Trevor. I didn't have a choice. Thanks to you, the police assumed I was the victim. I just had to show them the letters. Except this one. So when you think about it, it's your fault Trevor died. - You're sick! - Yeah. The funny part is Darryl's the one who cared about the money. I didn't care about the money. I just wanted to make you suffer. And then you gave me the writing job. And now I'm going to have everything that you have. When you think about it, that is the sweetest kind of revenge. - You'll never get away with this. - You are so wrong, sweetheart. When the world finds out that I killed Darryl in an attempt to protect you, Modern Media Works is gonna pass the torch on to me. And I will continue to lead the fight on behalf of our fallen martyr, Amelia Davis. - I wish I'd gotten to you earlier. Luckily, you called me when you did. - I don't feel lucky. - This isn't your fault. There was no choice. It was either you or her. I've got some good news. Carlo woke up. He's gonna be OK. He was asking about you. Here comes the press. We better get you home. No more vehicles on the parade route for today. - You take care of yourself, Amelia. - I'm gonna be OK, Hank.
