Commissioner Bertrand brutally murdered on the Grande Cormiche. Cop or Hood Hey, the lights. Well, here we go. If you want to know the time, its about nine-thirty Your money. ...and your wallet Your boots... they look great. Give me your jacket, as you're there. Hurry, you're not the only one we need to see tonight. What's that? Shit. Hey, guys! You should not have to use that stuff especially if you can get things done... just by asking. Could you take off your pants, gentlemen? I said strip I want to know what you have underneath I hear silk is back in fashion. Tell your boss Antonio Cerrutti is here. They're not receiving visitors while in mourning. Oh, good! Is anyone home? Are you crazy? I'm here about the night of the 12th Could you tell me about the Commissioner Bertrand. My husband is dead I'm sorry, but can I ask how? He died on duty. His body was found on the Grande Corniche... some thugs had killed him. Your grief blinds you. He was found in the dashing little Hotel Printania... in the company of a hooker. You don't... ...mean it? I am Antonio Cerrutti and the whore was my little sister... It's a family affair. I don't understand. I do, it's clear. Isn't it just. Camille, will you discuss the matter with this... 'gentleman' Don't you think this approach is inappropriate? Times are tough, Camille. Times are bad for everyone. All the more reason to help each other, Camille. If you're nice to me, I'll tell you everything. I serve out my year and a half in Canada I was counting on Rita to get me a foot in the door and... Presto! I do not know if you understand it, Camille. I'm trying, but I do not understand how the death of Commissioner Bertrand, an exemplary officer... If he was a model policeman, how much do you think would that would be worth? This is a really nice villa. We... rent That's a shame. We have helped your family Mr Cerutti. Your mother will tell you. Obviously, if you have other demands... - Sure I do. - I understand. You are too sweet. People like us can always come to some understanding. In the meantime, you can get your finances in order. Eh!... When do you think? I don't want to rush. Let's say tomorrow morning. 11:30. Does Mrs Cerrutti still live around here? She lives over there... up in the attic and at the bottom of a bottle. Poor Mom Cerrutti, I am all alone. Thank you sir. We have children... we give them health. Cheers My poor little Rita. My little angel. Ah, if you had known. I am very sorry. It was always the high life with that girl. So much joy. Poor Clara! Poor Clara! Her name wasn't Rita? No, I'm Clara Give me another glass. With pleasure, madam. My poor little girl. Misfortune ...she believed everything he said. When Mario came... - ...The look... - Who's that, Mario? Mario, the dancer... well the pimp. Supposedly a big time player. An Amir, who was waiting in Printania. An oil baron... in Printania? She believed everything Mario said he had all the talk. Even with me, he said I was beautiful. He had a roguish charm that Mario. Then, gentlemen, this isn't fair. We have a custome Good morning. Charming home. Thanks. What do you want? I need to get this clear On the night of 12th, Mario remembers bringing Rita here ...but he has forgotten what happened after that. What can I get you? A beer. Mrs. Langlois. 2 beers. The Commissioner arrived long after the little girl? Commissioner-What? Who? Commissioner Bertrand. We're not talking about the same person Wasn't he killed by gangsters He was found on the Grande Corniche. The beer is 12 francs. It's warm Mrs. Langlois, two beers from the fridge. The customer is always right. We were at the funeral. Do you want to know what happened... No. Before that. Mario arrived around 10am. 10:00... maybe 10:05 And then what? I gave the key to room 7 Soon a car came and I told him that Mrs. Langlois was about to close up for the night It's true. That was when we heard the gunshots. So my wife and me, we ran. When we opened the door of number 7 there was a pool of blood. Then what did you do? Nothing. Mario called the cops. Yes, the vice squad. We didn't want any scandal. They came... ...quicly? I don't remember How about we will do a little... ...reconstitution. And we'll time it. I'm here and pops was over there with his lady. I run to run to room 7. I call the vice squad as soon as I get there. How long were they? Marcel, tell him! That night, they were fast. 5, 6 minutes? Yes about that. Maybe 2 minutes or even 3? Perhaps. Could it be that they were already there? Yes, possibly. What were their names? You, I know you don't want me fix it on your husband. But you don't care about this one? The officers were called... ...Massart and Rey. The one with the glasses is Rey. He's the more dangerous. The other one is Massart. Can I help you? No, it is not worth it. Hey, have you seen the box? It is not disgusting. That is what, this, like car? Did you see? Look at the draw, slightly. -There's a package. Hey, the guy at the car. Oh my! Very nice! Musard, Theodore Musard. That's who I want But why call him an Auvergne? Because he is one. Musard loves the money. Not that he needs it, he's swimming in the stuff Roulette, baccarat, blackjack. Everything that falls on the green baize or bounces into a slot... He controls all the gaming from Marseilles to Menton. Even the bowls. Undress. Eh!... I said strip. Good, then naked. Get out. I'm sure you've got a phone call to make. You 're crazy? Yes OK, I'll make a call. You're not going to ask me who to call? No, no. And my car? Do you need it to make a call? Well... no Who the hell is he? Number 3. One second, please. No more bets. Oh, sorry. All bets please 18 Red Good evening sir. Good evening. Is Mr. Musard here? The boss arrived around 10:00. Ok Thank you. Go get me a pair of trousers. He's not embarrassed. No more. 4 Per 100. All bets please. Four-black, even First 6 full. For you -5100 francs. -5100. -50 Odd francs. - The games, gentlemen. Lights! Do not panic. There's been an explosion but its nothing to worry about. Make your way calmly to the exit. Remember! Make some room... coming through Trouble? There. Is that real? No. I have not tried to repair it... I know my limits. What a night! I was at the casino I don't know how much I was down. Then all of a sudden Bang No. Yes. A bomb, apparently. Imagine that... a bomb? Is nowhere safe anymore? There is no danger. Good night. Good evening Mr. Musard. If Achille is behind this, I want to see him... tied naked to a palm tree in the midday sun. They haven't added up the cost yet It's not about money. You're rather good at this. I practice a lot. How about a cool drink in a friendly atmosphere? I must have some champagne at home. But is that the atmosphere you like? We will see. Do you mind if I? Not at all But you're leaving your car here? It's not mine. But... As I said. It's not my car. I did not know the elders of the Riviera, spoke English... ...Well, there you are. When my grandfather hung this painting, my grandmother ...almost left. When he hung it there, she left. I would have loved to draw. With your gun? Oh... You're not nervous? You meet a strange man, you bring him to a large empty house It was not so strange, just a charming man who ...changed... ...my wheel. What am I to think? That he's going to rape me? ...it's not like we're alone. There is the driver, the maid, the cook... ...and a dog. However, you could be right. Maybe I'm just lonely. It's not... It is... A friend. Loyal, attentive, charming. He was Minister of... He had numerous ministries. He was also lots different committees ...Now he's the Presidential Adviser to the IMF... It's all just a game And how about you? What do you do when you're not helping stranded motorists? ...What's your game? Put it this way... In cops and robbers. I play a half in each camp. Wait, it will come back. You so casually tossed phrases like: ...First. I like the beautiful. By losing the faith, men have lost the sense of wonder. It was just like on TV. You have a good memory. I do not remember where I've seen you On tv? I am a novelist, you know. Edmonde Puget-Rostand. Have you read any of my work? Unless you've written a comic, there's no chance. You've written enough nice things about loneliness. On loneliness and age. Something you do not know. Because of love, what you can unlock! Two representatives of the municipal police picked up Theodore Musard in a phone booth. where he was in a very unfortunate situation. CRS also discovered the burned out wreck of his car... in the early hours of the morning It was left on the roadside. Do you mind? Not at all If we add to this... ...The attack against the casino Tivoli, one can only think that... someone is trying to intimidate Mr Musard But who? He has no enemies. Do we see a new war between the groups? Yes, according to Commissioner... ...Grimaud. How much long can they go on raising the price of pastry? Croissants are already 1.30 francs. Oh, 1.30 francs! Instead of croissants, you'll need to eat biscuits. I'm more worried about what else is happening... Last night for example It's funny, that. I understand that the Auvergne's complaint. But you, what's your involvement? Me, nothing. The Auvergne can not help thinking that... ...Corsicans were somehow involved in ...the explosion. But you're innocent? You have my word. What would a war would lead to? Everything rests with the Auvergne. Us, that's a separate matter The coexistence continues as long as the agreement stands The agreement? There was... ...a pact. Peace talks between the bandits? That's not my business, Achilles. And the order in the city, this is not your business either? The Corsicans place a bomb in Marseilles, and Marseilles... ...strikes back against the Corsicans. We can not call... ...This disorder. For your bombing, I just might bust someone from Achiliea ...We'll look into it in detail, find witnesses, ...Like the Corsican who had stolen your car... It would be nice, yes. And you will direct our agent to several pounds of drugs in the cabinet of Ashil Ah yes, yes. This would be the beginning of some historic compromise Not my style. Me, my kind, you see, is the law. And you? It goes without saying. I was sure. It is best that everyone stays in his place. I'll wait while you do it. The first one to find anything, calls the other. I think your taxi's here. I have my habits. 9:00 til 1:00 its writing. Balzac and Zola wrote in the morning. But they slept at night. Edmonde, I admire your dedication Au revoir, Mademoiselle. To the campsite please. How much is that? -75frs. Could I have a receipt? It is Mr. Cerrutti. Tell him to come in... but use the door this time. Please, my dear, stay calm and dignified. We will do the rest. So you have you come to a figure? I really would like to end this all today... Why don't we end it now? This is Mr Volfoni. He's been looking after me since the death of my husband He's been looking after Mom too, since my little sister died. Achilles, the selfless defender of widows and orphans Cerrutti. Antonio Giuseppe Cerrutti. Born in 1936 in Calabria. Imprisoned for 12 months in prison Montcalm. For armed robbery. 18 months. 18... yes indeed. Why don't you return to Canada? I hear its very... beautiful. Yes, it is beautiful, but winter is too long. If its sun you want, we could always find you papers ...For the tropics. The only papers that interest me are those of... the National Bank The ones with the face of Blaise Pascal in the corner. I will go as soon as I get my money. Someone's gonna have to pay, my friend. There is no other way. Now we are in a situation that I rather hoped to avoid I don't take kindly to blackmail Me? Blackmail? Mr Cerrutti, I pay my taxes Just like everybody else I'm entitled to seek the protection of - ...the police. - Rey and Massart? Indeed. Threats, attempted extortion! You need to come with us Mr Cerrutti. Ah the state pays them monthly. And so do you. You're right in the shit. Now talk... You killed Mario. Why did you do it? Wait... Has he turned canary? Not yet. Try putting him in his cage... -No wait. Let me question him No. I want you to write up your report. ...You, Madam. Daddy! - I'm sorry miss you can't be here. - Daddy! What's this game. I do not want problems with kids Daddy! Its okay. Come over here. I want to know what's going on Me too, Dad. You're not in England? You're not ...a cop? Now stop. What are you doing in jail? I'm writing my memoirs Did they beat you? Five minutes in a private school and you're back with all these subversive ideas. What are you doing home anyway? I was feeling nostalgic For what? The Eiffel Tower? For you. Cerutti, it's time. Cerrutti? Jack the Ripper was called Murdoch. Pierrot le Fou, Moutrel. Nobody kills under his own name. It's not the done thing to embarrass the families. I'm more worried about you I offer a holiday on the most beautiful lawn in the world. the changing of the guard, cricket,all that stuff. ...And you run away? For a father, its a disappointment. But for a prisoner, what a lesson. Go there and wait for me! Edmonde 61-38-93. And if its 15 years? And I'm wearing my head under my arm right? Cerrutti. Go. Okay. Leave us. Good. You've been sent to Paris to investigate the death of Commissioner Bertrand. You call it an internal investigation. Let me tell you that the police department has changed. You bet it has changed. Commissioner Bertrand... rotten to the core killed by the no less corrupt Rey and Massart working for Achilles. But to be fair, at least he's not on the job. Massart-Rey, They're my problem Early Retirement, vacation in the sun. Believe me, they deserve worse. And Achilles? There's nothing I can do Yes there is Legally, nothing. He has political connections. Connections are not a bulletproof vest You know who you remind me with your methods? He gave a warning. Fired the first shot in the air. He didn't have time for a second one. I am not of those who shoot in the air. I do not want my name on a marble slab. It shouldn't come to that What do we do? Arrest them? Convict them? They'll be out again in no time. 15 years of taking down the same people. They're just stooges... and pretty soon the top dogs will be giving us orders. Sometimes the only way to save the apple is to kill the worm. Are you with me? How far are you prepared to go, Commissioner Borowitz? Far enough. How come you were here when the police arrived? I didn't have time to hide. The police surprised you? Yes That doesn't make any sense. Why don't you tell me what really happened Ok Let me set the scene I had an meeting arranged with the deceased. We were supposed to meet over here. No, wait. Right here. I waited and waited. I was getting a little impatient. Can I continue? Are you ready? Yes Go ahead. Are you sure? I left. Get him! Stop! Remember ...the warning... Anthony Cerrutti, I arrest you in the name of the law. - Shit - he's too far away I wish I'd thought of that. All patrols, all patrols. Suspect currently on the run Be on the look out for Antoine Cerrutti, aged 40... Last seen wearing blue jeans, a pair of sneakers ...and a leather jacket. He has a .357 Magnum revolver, unloaded. Bye-Miss. Thank you, M. Agostinelli. Yes It's my turn! Bravo, Mr. Agostinelli. You didn't signal. You'll never get your licence. You can't use your horn here. Its banned in the village. Failure to give way, speeding. You see? They give licences to anyone nowadays. Ah... no entry What now? Oh, the police. They'll take your licence, ...before you even have it. Oh! It is not right! Guess what? You failed. Ah, c'mon I respected the stop sign, didn't I? You should... put a character... like Mr. Borowitz in your next novel. Edmonde told me that... you're staying. I'm not sure, the night has just started. Who knows how it will end. Any moment you might hear the phone Sometimes I sLangloisp dressed. Dressed or undressed, exactly where will you sLangloisp? I did prepare the pink room. Good... I'll sLangloisp in the blue room. And you? Is there anymore dessert? This child has only been here two days and already its love. I think I'd like to retire here when I'm finally through with politics I like strawberries. I understand you. -Daddy, I want strawberries. Help yourself. Isn't that a weird craving? This weekend will probably seem short It seems that this is normal, in my state. I think Charlotte said something interesting. I wonder how one can assume responsibilities as... ...Yours. I'm pregnant. Listen. I said you could help yourself to strawberries. ...don't complicate matters I'm 14 and a half years of age and pregnant Did you hear what I said? You are 14 and a half years old and you're pregnant. All right. Congratulations. But that's not so unusual Some African girls marry at the age of 8. They develop early Like Mozart. He showed his genius when he was still in his infancy Yes, my God. Good. Shall we take coffee in the lounge. Uncle Stan is going for a walk. He'll bring back some lovely candy. And some chewing gum. Little Charlotte has a craving. Hey, you want to invite us for a drink? Don't you think its getting late. You should be home. Surely you have parents, relatives or even fiances... waiting for you. Mr Langlois is looking sLangloispy. His poor wife too No... really, I'm fine. C'mon now. Good evening ladies. I hope you'll understand if I don't accompany you all home. Mr Achille he has excellent taste A treat. So? What do we do? What's that? I couldn't get Holy water... it's just regular gasoline. It cost me nearly 300 francs I would have sent for an exorcist, but that would also cost money. An exorcist? What for? To chase out the devil. My sister came here and... bang! Now she's in heaven! Commissioner Bertrand too and poor Mario. This place is cursed I tell you! I worry about you! This is place is bad for your health But this place isn't mine, I am just the manager! Even better. It would be so sad if this was the old family business If Mrs Langlois had been born here... It might have been sentimental. You want a beer? No thank you. I don't have the time. Excuse me! Hello, Mr. Musard? I'm ready to ignite. But what should I do with these two? Burn them? Frankly, it might be for the best. Good news. You're not going to burn He's nice, eh, the Auvergne? That's not all. But when you gotta go, you gotta go. Waiting for me, dog? Here's your treat. Take it, brother. There. Take it. Stop, that's enough. I've brought your chewing gum. Loads of different colours. But don't overdo it. Otherwise's you'll end up with a huge belly. What's happening? I heard the dog barking. I had to go for a walk to calm down. Not only am I shocked, but the whole situation makes me nervous. This situation is getting dangerous. Did you hear him? Did you hear him call the Auvergne? As clear as I hear you, Mr. Achilles. OK fine. I shall sort the problem with Mr Musard... Calmly and quietly But Mr Cerrutti... I have no control over him. He comes, he goes. Unmanagable, as they say. I do not like people who play with fire. It's not good. I talked to the doctor who treated Mrs Langlois ...Talking about forest fires. Ah yes? The arsonists, they're all bitter. Its always the same. This story of revenge, perhaps it is all made up. Maybe the sister too. Go on. A made up sister? I've heard stranger things. The old woman didn't have a son. Then Rita had no brother. Then who the hell is this guy? Nobody knows. Nothing. But we'll find out. Do you mind watching everyone fly off somewhere? Don't you want to know the midnight sun, the desert... Tartar...? Are you offering to take me? No, but I can invite you to dinner tonight. Arrival of Air France Flight 165, from... ...Tehran, post number 8. Tehran? They said Tehran? Yes. Are you travelling today No, I'm just waiting for someone. So listen. Tonight at the port. The Esquinade 9 o'clock. Table for two? Look, darling. Uncle Michael. Go quickly, my darling. I'm sure you want to pee. Your rabbit too. Empty it into the urinal I can't do it. Go on... And now flush. You know I'm done for. That's your problem. Hey, sonny. Here, take your little rabbit. The whole background is turquoise? Yes It will be better than before. It's not cheap, but I want the best. What is it? Sorry. It's some guy who says he wants to give your trousers back. It's that that son of a bitch! I wanted to make sure you'd not caught a cold. That night time air can give you chills What do you care? It's Achilles, who is worried. But you did say that at the airport, everything went well. Continue. - The travelers arrived. - Continue. Landing-easy, no wind at the ground. Ideal. You see? It was after it was spoiled. The grandfather was caught malaria or something. He emptied... ...Rabbits in the bathroom. Apart from that, you happy? Well, your new office. I love turquoise. How do you know? I had a look when I arranged the 'wake up call' The wake up call? If you have a last wishes, if you want to pray, now might be a good time Everybody out! You have decided on the turquoise? Out! Out! But the turquoise? Oh, how sad. Coffee Sir? Double Espresso. Would you get me a Coke? No. No, really? OK, I'll get it myself Excuse me. Hello, Mom? Where am I? I'm in Nice. England? Dad made me come back. He missed me too much. He couldn't do without me. He's terribly possessive. I can't even go to the movies alone. Want to talk to Mom? Okay, love you Have you told her she's going to be a grandmother? I only said that to get your attention. Sometimes it's like I'm almost invisible But when it comes to women with beautiful legs... 5 years ago, we had to go to La Baule because you'd fallen for a violinist Then you said you'd take me sailing -We went But it wasn't just the two of us. What was her name again? You're completely missing the point. A widow... And this time? M. Rostand is a friend of your mom. Do you know how long I've known... Well I've known you... ...14 years and 8 months. And we've not even talked for 10 minutes about what I like or dislike. OK, you've got 10 minutes. Start talking. Where are you going? C'mon, I was only joking. You know very well that I did not mean it. Shit I'll break open the door. Just like La Baule, when Mom's friend wanted to commit suicide. Charlotte, I beg you. Why? Afraid the old lady will hear? Join her down there knocking back the red wine. Do not talk like that. M. Rostand is a beautiful young woman. And stone cold sober. You want to play tennis tomorrow? Damn! Edmonde its me. Fuck Off Very nice! Bravo! Thanks! Shit! Wait. Okay! Police! Yes You know this man? Ah, I think so. A guy in a tuxedo at 10 am, with a geranium in his buttonhole, ...who asks you a for a receipt... He's not easy to forget. Massart! It's your partner. Thank you, Yes... A girl? Poor fool. Do not move, I'm coming. You know if Paris has responded to my inquiry? On who? The guy who's pretending to be Cerrutti. Ha! Ha! Your answer is on my desk. in 13x18. Its a lovely print. Commissioner Borowitz, head of internal investigations. He looks happy So? He in the diner. When he leaves, I'll shoot him. I'll wait as long as I have to. No problem. If only you knew what to expect. Listen. Nothing can surprise me. I wouldn't be so sure. What's that? So Commissioner Borowitz, Internal investigations. A real specialist It does not change anything. You're wrong. You know what they call him? No. What? The cleaner. No heart ...No ties. We, we are vulnerable as newborns babies. Cerrutti-or Borowitz, he still has a daughter. It's a tie. I say we forget it. Believe me, autumn in Venice is beautiful. Achille owes us that. And when we come back, this clown will be long gone. At this rate, he won't get far. I say its better to plug him now. I'll join you later. In which case, just a tip... don't miss. I'll just park the car. I'll be back soon Hurry, hurry. Let yourself go. De-stress. What, exactly, the midnight sun? This is a very interesting phenomenon. I'll tell you about it over dinner. What are you doing tonight? Nothing I can't cancel. What are you doing here? Just relaxing. We're guests. I'd prefer it if... We took this elsewhere. OK tonight, 9 o'clock, The Esquinade, table for two Put on something nice. You don't want me gunned down in front of Charlotte? - No, I don't want that. - Okay, time to fix things. Are you OK? Yes. Everything's great. Not too hot? No, no. Great. Are you happy? Let me out! Open the door. Oops. It just came off in my hand. It is because of stuff like that that I left the profession. Its has broken. See. Thank you. Okay? How is it? They thought the statue contained drugs. But it was just talc. How are the cops? Dishonest. Hopefully it'll all end well. I'll catch a taxi. I have an appointment with the masseuse, ...But I'll be there for dinner. - We should go to the restaurant. - Already, we left the car. Yes. - Its Rey. - Come on up - What is it now? - It's me, Cerrutti. What do you want you bastard? I'm here to warn you. Rey is dead. I'd be surprised. I hear him coming. Yes he's on the way, but he's still dead. I want to talk to M. Wilson. It is very urgent. Right then Achilles, where's the body? He's in the room. But I have nothing to do this. We'll see Achilles, I find in you with the body of the Inspector Rey. Do not be surprised if I suspect you of murder. You make me laugh. Killing a police officer at my house without a weapon. Listen to me, M. Principal. Look around. You won't even find a pocket knife. I want to know... - who has the audacity to arrest me! - Me. Cerrutti. What are you doing here? Achille. Let me introduce the Divisional Commissioner Borowitz. Undercover. Anything you say may be used against you. Undercover but totally legit. No hard feelings. -Sorry Nice to see you again. And you. Last time I had to shoot you. I signed the custody warrant for Achille Volfoni. Its a shame we did not find the murder weapon. Because it looks bad? Impossible. You couldn't have found a gun at my place. I don't have one. It was in the vase. Under your hydrangea. You bastard! Guard! Guard! - Take me back to my cell. - I know you didn't kill him. But you have gunned down others. If we add to that the racketeering, drugs, whores ...it makes a nice litte charge sheet. I'm thinking it should be good for at least 20 years. It's a kind of recognition of merit! Listen to me, Borowitz. It is too early to know which of us will laugh last Camille is dead. Now I know. It's a blow for Achilles. He's misguided. He's sends gunners when he should... ...diplomats. By bumping off Rey, Borowitz crossed a line Now every one of us risks being found at home... a cold corpse. I'd rather not. That is why I think we could find a way to - ...work together. - You work for Achilles. Achille is fried. But I say, his hookers, hotels, and all... Yes It is a branch that I do not know that well. - You can always learn. - And then there's Borowitz. - Whether it's for long, though? - Rey and Camille had the same idea. I would look for an alternative. I was looking for ways to pinch him. Do you know of any? That's why I come to you. M. Rostand, please. Edmonde, how about dinner tonight? Say about 9 o'clock at The Esquinade Just the two of us. Ah! What do you mean 'what am I going to do?' I've done everything! We've raided every empty property. Turned over every informant. Then how come you've got nothing I'll tell you this... We will not negotiate with kidnappers! I'm sorry but that's the bottom line. Sometimes it suits that I am an honest cop, other times not! Would you throw away the entire operation to get your daughter back? You're ready to fuck me over if you have to. You bet! Not just you. It's all going to come tumbling down, you hear me? I've never heard such bullshit. I can not listen to such crap! I order you to... You know where you can stick your orders? The kidnappers will call to arrange a trade off. Achille for Charlotte. No way! It's taken 15 years to get Achilles. 15 years he mocked me, and I was silent! Now we've got him and he can rot in jail. Those old days are over Yes... Borowitz. You're very kind, miss. Put me through to the prosecutor's office. Could I have a word? Close the door. No. Would you go out and close the door. M. Deputy? Its Borowitz here They've found the murder weapon. I knew they would With the confessions and this evidence, there's no escape for Achilles. I'll send it to the courthouse so you can prepare the warrant. OK. Bye Borowitz Bye Come in, my friend. I heard about your daughter. It must be hard for you. What's the boss doing? Where do we stand? Nowhere. We've set up roadblocks. Do you believe that'll help? You have a better idea? Not yet. But if I was leading the investigation, I might do things differently. Should I leave? No, no, it's fine. Edmonde. Any news? No, I would have called you. Are you staying late? I'll be here a while. And then I might go for a massage. I'm getting the pains again No, I'm not sure how late I'll be So what would you do? I would get results. We have something in common... The rulebook doesn't bother us. True, but we don't have the same motive. Camille was a killer and Rey was a rotten cop. You were not there when Commissioner Bertrand was killed. Something had to be done. And Rey... believe it or not, was an excellent cop. Just some people don't know when to stop. And some know, right? Yes Inspector Massart returns to the fold Back with the white sheep. I'll still need to see that you've changed. Maybe if you gave me... a taste? If I found your girl? I would be a relief just to be back on the job. Time is short. What do you say? Events decide, not people. If you get results, you can call me Stanislaus Charlotte... will call you Uncle.

There's no need to mention M. Rostand to your mother. Just say we slept in a hotel. or that we rented a villa. With eucalyptus. We got up early, ...We took breakfast on the terrace, you worked... ...on your English. We talked about Mom. I, always a little sad even thought to call. Or we could just keep quiet. I can't, it'd be too suspect And we're off!
