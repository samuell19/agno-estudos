PARTLY CLOUDY WITH SUNNY SPELLS In a world shattered by horrible monsters, only an elite few fight a heroic battle against these filthy swine. The road tax came today, what a bomb ! - Haven't we paid it ? - That was for trash collection. There's the Income tax too. The bank called again today, we're 90 thousand under. - They want to shut us down. - No one's paying. How can "Puffs and Sofas" give 50% discounts ? They don't pay into the retirement fund ! And that's almost 30%. And they have the Chinese workers sleep in the cellar. - Let's report them ! - Come on, Ermanno... this is Italy ! - So, what do we do, close ? - No, fire. No way, the FAU Cooperative has never fired anyone. Great, then we're screwed. If all members took salary cuts ? In 1951, during the flood... Cecco, you're already earning peanuts. Peanuts ? It's started, let's go. - This foolishness again ! - Like all Mondays. It's Giacomo's new industrial strategy. Diversify ! 90. You start winning from the third number. Padre Pio gave me these numbers in a dream. Aren't you an atheist ? Sure, but we'll win 12 million euros with those numbers. Well worth the conversion ! 47. I feel great vibes today. The fifth number is 79. Not this time either ! Hey, still feelin' those vibes ? I gotta resolve everything anyway. Cecco, let's go home, it's late ! Listen... what if we defer the income tax payment ? - We'd better not. - We'd better not. Stop, that's good. - It's not even three meters. - Right. So when we have the money, we'll dig them up and dispose of them. - You idiot, they're toxic. - It's just glue. You got me into this venture, let's go a little deeper ! This venture gives us two salaries. Choose: the workers or nature. I'm not choosing a fucking thing, do this crap yourself ! Think I can't ? Hold this ! I'll take these tanks down, watch ! Goddammit, you broke a sewer pipe, you're a clod ! I told you it was enough. 'Better' is the enemy of 'good'. - It stinks ! - Cover it with dirt. You can't cover it, it's gotta come out, that's the nature of shit. Holy crap ! Stop, and beg forgiveness for your sins. You know what you're guilty of. Prepare to die, tiny human worm ! Dad ! - Still at it with these comics ? - They're manga. I'm working on a story of my own, I'm in a competition, the prize is a trip to Tokyo. Shit ! You flunked a year for these fucking comics. Either I do what you want or I'm a jerk. What's going on ? What's this smell ? Tomorrow you work at the cooperative, time to switch gears. Pedal, get movin' ! Ermanno, don't push him, he's only 17. No, it's okay, Mom, I'll be ready tomorrow at 7 ! Good. Raki's moment of truth had come: either he defeated the monster that brought such fear and pain that only he had the courage to face, or he'd remain an outcast, the usual loser. Raki would become a hero. Come out, you ornery beast ! You'll feel the bite of my katana. Shit, I drew him too big ! Geeze ! I'll free this country from your filthy presence, you ugly moron ! You'll soon quench my thirst for blood, you twit ! Choke on it ! What are you doing here ? Go make sofas ! - Pedal, get movin'. - Yeah, I'm going. Amazement and fear gripped Raki, but he'd seen who was the monster and he'd never let go. But if I'm crossed in love, I'll become... - Good boy, Rigoletto ! - Cecco, what's today's forecast ? High humidity ! But as soon as I see you, the sun shines, Ginetta. What a liar ! What are you doing here ? And Tito ? - He works here, starting today. - Weren't we firing ? It reeks ! A disaster happened, we broke a sewer pipe. Let me see. Dammit, we didn't need this ! It's a mixture of alkane and cycloalkane hydrocarbons with a percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons up to 20% with a small percentage of oxygenated sulfured or nitrate compounds. So what is it ? Oil ! - Quiet ! - Oil ! - Careful ! - Oh, shit ! Fuck... Ermanno ! Scared you, huh ? What a jerk. Careful ! Do you realize ? Holy shit, oil ! Remember, absolute silence. We have to tell the coop, it's positive news. Wait, if we go public, it'll be a mess. Think of lottery winners, either suicide or destitute. But Paola and Cecco are on the Board. Yeah, sure ! Let's go have a drink. 53, 54, 38... Not one number today. - Mom, you're sure I can call him ? - Sure, he's like family. He's Mario's son, Mario who immigrated to America. - He worked on oil platforms ? - Yes, his son's in oil too. He's a big name ! Spends vacations here. - I don't know him, you call. - Paola, I'm playing ! - So, I can call ? - Call. - If I wait, we can go together ? - No, go on. Go with your friends. Make that call ! She can't do anything alone, she's so apprehensive. Three in a row ! Hey, Mr. Mayor, we'll slaughter them today ! Why say hi ? He's never taken notice of us ! Never mind, things change. - Has Paola heard from that oilman ? - Not yet. There he is ! Sharing minds. Go, Gabriele ! He's a real champion ! Talis pater, talis filius. I don't understand this game. It's not a game, it's a philosophy of life, there are no draws in baseball. Either you win or you lose. Time doesn't count, it can last a minute or all eternity. Paola spoke to this Lombelli, he'll be waiting tomorrow. Excuse me... what's the price of crude oil ? How do I know ! - Excuse him. - Okay, thank you. Let's move ? Why should Lombelli screw us ? He's practically Paola's family, think positive ! You over-simplify and say things will work out. That's why you and I are together: I'm the smart ass, so you can be pure. What crap ! Look at the great watermelons, it must be a good year. Same old fucking idiot ! It's fabulous ! You said it ! Remember, in eighth grade, when that farmer shot your ass with salt ? - Man, it stung ! - You were scared shitless. You bastards, you just left me there. Nah, you didn't get away in time. - No, you ran without telling me ! - I yelled, you just stood there. No way, I remember very well ! Holy shit... What if it's true ? This thing's a little scary. Besides, what do we do with all that money ? - If it makes us assholes ? - More than now ? Right ! You know what I'd like to do ? Tell them all to piss off, fly to America and bicycle coast-to-coast. Do you have a dream ? A dream ? Never thought about it. I don't have time for dreams, customers don't drop in our laps. It's gotta be him, the waitress said he's here to fish. Yeah, the third hut. Mr. Lombelli ! Hi ! Oil is an enigma, a torment, like a woman. You have to court her, love and respect her, because, if you betray her, oil will seek revenge. But then, the satisfaction when you pump it and it bursts forth... Us too, when we saw it burst out... Knowing if an oil well will yield is an art. Usually it's just a scam! - Cheers ! - Cheers ! But don't worry, they call me "99%". 99% ! Michael William Lombelli never makes a mistake. Almost never. - Don't you like it ? - Yes, sure. My mother was from Texas. My father was Italian, he worked on a platform and I was raised on the legend of Mattei. Mattei... "The big companies buried him", my father said. He wanted national energy independence. I learned it in Rimini as a boy, for the foreigners. I even married one. Of course. I had to learn to work with the big foreign companies. You've got capital, right ? We could make a joint venture. Our banks are anxious to get into the business. We'd like to diversify, right ? Good. I almost forgot the most important thing. Silence, not a word. No one must know. The oil's not yours yet. Attention please ! A special meeting ! What is it, do we close or did we win the lottery ? Neither one. To make it short, we found a little oil in the yard. Enough to recharge a lighter ? Come on! The oil's really there, but they didn't want to tell us, to cut us out. - Great, comrades ! - No one's being cut out ! You weren't even born when I was in the hills with the partisans, jerk ! Commander, don't get mad. Ermanno and Giacomo will explain it all to you, they just talked to a famous American mining engineer. Sure, not a word ! I didn't know, Cecco called the meeting, Dino found it all out. So, everything's okay, Lombelli is a lovely person, but it's not as easy as it seems. So ? - First: it's state oil. - Isn't it on our land ? For Italian law, everything underground is the state's. Yeah, everybody gets a slice in Rome. So, what do we do ? There's a lot of red tape. To see if it's worth pumping. With the money we get, we pay off the bank. But does the oil belong to all members ? Relax, Ahmed, let's respect seniority. According to the statute, members share all assets equally. Just thank God they took you, or you'd be rummaging in the trash now. - Albanian racist... - I'm an Italian citizen now ! What's all this ruckus ? Stop ! - Good thing we're all comrades. - Friends. I'm not done. We need research to be sure there's an oil field, that's about 300 thousand euros. - The lottery was better ! - Where do we get it ? - That's what we have to talk about. - Let's hear "Calculator" ! There are 20... Each member gives 25 thousand euro. What ? And if there's no oil field ? - We lose it all. - What kind of a proposal is that ? Don't we vote ? The Assembly rules ! What the fuck do we vote ? If I had 25 thousand euros, I'd be on my own ! Put your money into the cooperative, not into non-existent oil Think we've never done that ? Asshole ! - Who's an asshole ? - You. Think I'm scared because you're the boss ? There are no bosses here ! He's the business manager, we're all the same ! - No way, I don't have an SUV ! - Hey, knock it off ! Raki shouldn't have been moved to pity as usual, he should have gone straight to his goal. Welcome to this awesome evening. Today the final clash is for the galactic title. Soon Giacomus, a mutant of the latest generation, vs. Pierus Operaius. The stakes, a splendid SUV ! Play, place your bets, exploit our odalisques... - Do you have the money, big boy ? - Out of my way ! I'll take care of you later, for free ! There he is ! Master, what is my future ? Will I become a worthy warrior and defeat Kobo ? Pedal, get movin' ! They're right, first we talk about cuts, then we toss money like this. We're not tossing it, we're investing ! Oil is our last hope, the banks will soon wipe us out. And you two, nothing to say ? Ermanno's right, your idea of mortgaging the houses, then with the interest... Setting up a company outside the cooperative is betrayal. - I don't understand bureaucracy. - We cut members out, simple. You're teaching me ? I'm the one who taught you about cooperatives ! If this works, we'll save the cooperative, then you'll see smiles ! Why should it work out for us ? You just can't think big ! Can't you see this is a turning point ? No, we'll lose our shirts. And it's the wrong signal to members, count me out ! You refuse to risk, because you're chicken, you've always been scared of a risk. And you're selfish, when it's about money, nothing stops you ! Fuck off ! You've never been a real entrepreneur, because it takes intuition, courage, guts. You know what ? I'll do this alone. Hi, Dad ! Still up ? And you ? Was the party fun ? The usual people, all drunk after an hour. Mom called, she wants to know when you'll visit. I don't know. Your grandparents will come over from Frankfurt. - The games are on now. - She wants to see you, Gabriele. She's the one that walked out. C'mon, come have a seat. It's hot ! It's good that way too. Listen, do you think I'm a selfish bastard ? No, sometimes you're just out for yourself, but that's okay. Would you risk everything to change your life ? How the hell do I know, I'm fine like this. And you ? Good question. It always moves me to descend into Mother Earth's tender belly. So ? Stratified calcareous land with quartz residue. Scent of... southern Arabic. What do you say, should we go on ? I'd like to be a psychic, my friend, but this is science: analyses, seismic tests... First, we have to apply to the Ministry. This is still no-man's land. Whoever gets there first, wins out. Do you have a person who's good with paperwork ? I can't now, I have the quarterly taxes ! - And how can I tell Ermanno ? - How long have we been friends ? Friends, exactly, why don't you cut it out ? So ? What do I have to do ? - There he is, I'll introduce you. - Hi, Giacomo. - How's it going ? - Fine. Mr. Michael Lombelli. Calculator... Paola. A pleasure, bonjour. Salam aleikum. They told me that... You are the mind ! They really did! Oh Lord, comme ci, comme ça, I get by, after so many years with numbers... We'll fill in the application together, but don't worry, I'll guide you across. - All the way to Rome ? - Yes. I don't know... trains give me panic attacks. Don't worry, I'll be with you on the train. What's the name of the office ? Monitoring, Analyses, Evaluation of Norms... - Okay, let's go. - Of the E.U... Do you have pen and paper ? No, but she has a phenomenal memory. - Tell me when you're ready. - She's ready. Write. Sworn legal certificate of company representatives, your police record. Consensus from the Ministry of Environmental Protection, consensus from the Ministry of Heritage and Cultural Activities, evaluation of compliance expressed by CIRM, consensus from the regional office for the Defense of Soil and Coasts, consensus from Geological Services on Environmental Compatibility, photostatic copy on unstamped paper of the work plan... - Excuse me, the Toponymy Office ? - Tomorrow. - But it's only 11:27. - Read what's posted. - We're registered. - Not with Toponymy ! Certificate of Compatibility from the Ministry of Environmental Protection, opinion from the Office of... Documentation of Geological Resources. ...with attached form... Request for permit... There's no stamp from the Natural Reserves and Park Office, I'm sorry. I'm pissed, call Lombelli. But... Michael William Lombelli, the engineer ? Yes. I did a masterclass with him, he's an outstanding professor, the most competent of all. - Fine. - Give me the file, I'll do it. And how is Michael... the engineer ? I haven't seen him since then. Fine, in great shape. In shape, yes, I remember him. You could have said he sent you, I'd have helped you compile this useless paperwork. Fine. - Will you say hello for me ? - Yes. Sandrone ! See ? Paola's with the American and the traitor. Ermanno, stop being such a baby. Tito ! Leave him alone, he's only 17. We were different, we liked football, politics... - Pussy. - Motorcycles. - These kids seem a bit like jerks. - We thought the same of you. What is it ? Go to the Chinese place and get some tea. - Can't you go ? - I'm on a bike. Hello. Excuse me, green tea ? There. - Sorry, is that Asami ? - Yes. - "The Silver-eyed Huntress" ? - You've read it ? I have all the issues. - May I ? - Sure. Awesome, it's in Chinese ! - Do you like it ? - Yes. I love the way the artist draws. Shan ! That's 5 euros. But didn't... I'd been on Kobo's tracks for three days, but it seemed like a lifetime. All he left behind was a tremendous stench. And to think we had something deeper in common... If she knew I'm drawing her naked, she'd kill me or maybe not. Geeze ! I've never seen such a... warrior woman ! What were you doing, you animal ? - I really... - Shut up ! There he is ! Come up ! C'mon, let's go get him ! Holy shit, they've been at for it a week now, they won't want to drill all the way under the cooperative, will they ? Better the devil you know than the one you don't. What the fuck's that got to do with anything ? Well ? Are you crazy ? This thing costs me 30,000 euros a day, take this down ! - This is the cooperative's land. - Then it's mine too. You piss me off, we can't work together anymore. What work ? This is the future ! Knock it off, the two of you ! Cecco, I didn't put the fence up. Okay, but you've messed up our lives with this fucking oil. Take the fence down. He doesn't have the right ! He's an arrogant bastard. I have licenses, want a war ? Okay. Don't move. What are you doing, stalling for time ? Just one more meter. So now you're fifty-fifty. They started arguing like a couple of kids, not even Cecco could make them reason. For a fucking fence ! And they say we're the kids. At least your father has a dream. Imagine if you become an oilman ! I'll have a gold bat made, like the sheiks. And you get loaded with pussy. C'mon ! There she is, go ! Hi, Ginetta. Young people who make love... Hi, Ginetta. - Hi, Shan. - Hi. I brought you some of my drawings. Thank you, but I have to go, bye. Tell me if you like them. - All your husband's fault. - Mom ! They want to asphyxiate us ! They act like bosses, they take the state road. My whole house is shaking. He just found it, then he pulled out. What a jerk, at least we'd die happy ! Even if they find oil, what's in it for the town ? Lots of money, we'll be like Abu Dhabi. We need to give a strong unified response. Let's collect signatures and take them to the Mayor. Good idea. - Let's do a class action. - I didn't want this war. But if they piss off Ermanno... Good, Ermanno for President ! We need you, we need you ! Great, Ermanno ! Go ! Some people scowl at me in town, is it about this oil thing ? They're jealous, huh ? Maybe. Are there any problems ? You're sure you'll find it ? Of course I will ! Lombelli's never wrong. Hello. Hello. How are things going ? - Fine, and you ? - Fine. It's very hot. It's quite a show, isn't it ? I've spent sleepless nights in the desert, dreaming in front of this beast, waiting for who-knows-what. You've been far away, haven't you ? Far away, alone... a wandering shepherd. I envy you, you've seen the world ! I'm scared of everything. Do I scare you too ? Excuse me... Drill, drill, anyway, nothing will fucking come of it. Yeah, poor Giacomo. This war's no good for anyone. Giacomo has stopped looking for customers, this is the last order. When this is done, we're on charity. Find a way, tell him the oil's just a dream. The whole town's against oil now. That's not true, lots of people have faith in it. It'll soon be over, there's no oil, he'll come crawling back. Don't you understand a thing ? We'll all lose out ! Don't even talk about it ! No, no... Don't say that or you'll put me in a tough spot. I called because we're friends, if we can't... If we can't turn to friends in these times... Alright. Okay, bye. Mario, it's Giacomo ! How are you ? Fine ! How's the family ? You're not at dinner ? Good, I'm calling because... You know about the oil thing, don't you ? No, it's going great, we're almost there. In fact, I was calling to ask for a little help, I have a cash flow problem and tomorrow I need to pay the workers. I was wondering if you could lend me, just for a week, then I'll repay you... 40 thousand euros. You too ? Even 20 thousand would make the difference, it would partly resolve... I see. No, don't worry, no problem... I just called Antonio, times are tough for him too. But anyway, don't worry ! Bye, kiss the kids for me. Sure, we'll have a nice pizza. Bye. Silvio ! Fuck off. Dad ! Are you here ? What is it ? Are things okay ? Pack your bags, I'm taking you to your mother in Germany. What's the trouble ? We're in deep shit. The drilling's fruitless, I'm ruined. - I don't want to live in Germany ! - Please, I even lost the house. I can't buy groceries. You're so fucking selfish. You said there was oil ! It's there, a few meters away, but I can't get to it, it would take another 40 thousand euros. Then go find it ! Think I haven't ? When you're in the shit, they all disappear. - Go to Ermanno ! - What's he got to do with it ? By now, he hates me. No, go to Ermanno ! You grew up together. Yes, Mom, I heard. He's on his way home, he's always here at this time. Here he is, he just came in. - Ermanno ? - Yes ? - I'm here. - Hi. Just in case maybe she tried to make a soufflé. I'll tell him. Bye, Mom. The bank sent Giacomo a letter, they're closing his credit limit, he's wiped out. I knew it, but him: "No problem", "You're chicken"... And they say there's no Divine justice ! - Now he's in the shit, good ! - What the hell are you saying ? It's Giacomo, your best friend. Has everyone gone crazy ! What happened ? Look what we've become ! I burned the sauce. I have to talk to you. Go ahead ! If it's for the fence, I've already seen a lawyer. No, wait, I have a proposal. I'll sell you some of my shares in the well. Ermanno... I'm in deep shit. Come in. I need money to keep drilling. - And you come to me for it ? - Yes. After all that's happened, you ask me for money to keep drilling ? It's absurd. Friendship is absurd. Right, in fact, I won't give you any, you have to stop. I can't, I've gone too far, I'd lose everything ! You were right, I shouldn't have gone on alone, I bit off more than I could chew. Goddammit... How much do you need ? Forty thousand ? You're nuts ! Not all from you, I'll ask Cecco too, and Paola. Then if we strike oil, we'll split it equally. Sure, oil... I'm a jerk ! Equal partners ! - No, it's just a loan. - I'll see a lawyer tomorrow. Don't tell a soul, you'll make me look like an asshole ! Thank you. I was no longer alone in my struggle and this encouraged me, even if this was such a personal matter. A river of oil ? What the devil is it ? Everything's opposite here. Look ! It's an upside-down world and so you're crazy about me. For the first time in my life, he fled from me. I'd stopped fearing him. But why did the notary call me a shareholder ? Wasn't it a loan ? - Because... - You own a share. But don't worry, we just wasted that money. I calculated, with Giacomo's salary, if the cooperative doesn't close and they don't strike oil, it will take 15 years to get the loan back. See, you haven't become a capitalist. Let's see... Much better ! If you really try... It's smooth, but, to be exact, it's a single stitch, instead it should be double and crossed, or it won't hold. Dad... Close the valve ! Holy shit ! Make that mud heavy ! Secure the well ! I guess he was right this time. We're rich ! - He's rich, and we took it in the... - Right, he's rich. But we'll block it, right ? All of us or no one ! Yeah. Look! Not now. C'mon, fuck, how long's it take ? Tighten that pipe ! Fuck, tighten it ! Sorry, I'll tell you later. 99% ! 99% ! 99% ! What seems positive isn't always positive. I never thought about it, but just with oil? - What does your paper say today ? - Storm coming. "And this is just the first of a series of oil wells that will revolutionize the future of Sant'Ugo and maybe even the whole country". Here's a picture ! It's like we're in Texas. Go Sant'Ugo ! Go, Gabriele, the final's all ours today ! Ermanno, come here. The president's here, up with the banners ! Hands off of Sant'Ugo ! Oil kills ! Look who's here. C'mon, Gabriele, make us dream ! The oilman's son ! Quiet, what's he got to do with it ? Bastards, it's shameful ! You clown ! Clown, clown, clown ! Go home ! - You're Fascists, shame on you ! - You're the Fascist ! Mind on the ball ! You're worthless. You're a bunch of dickheads ! Quiet ! Gabriele ! Clown, clown, clown... - One to nothing, ball in the center. - Stop it. - C'mon, don't worry. - No problem, Gabri. - Bye. - Bye. Nice hit, you're still one of the greats ! I used to do pretty well too. Why did you give it up ? Because... it was too important for me. When I'd come to bat, and the stadium was full, I'd be scared shitless. - Reminds me of someone. - No ! You have talent and guts too, you can make it. You too, I'd say... the oilman ! So, what's the problem ? This can't go on, if they find out, they'll hang me. Turn your shares over to the cooperative, they'll never know. My shares to the cooperative ? I don't think it's legal. You can, if you want. What about the "No Petrol" ? Do I give them shares too ? Your oilman soul has come out, huh ? I'll figure something, I'm always saving your ass. Hey, man, who came to me, with his tail between his legs ? Just try to keep them in line. Here it is, I found it ! Darling, listen... - Brugnotti's in there. - Brugnotti ? He wants to talk, he's sitting as if it were his own house. Hi, Claudio. Your wife makes an excellent soufflé, my compliments ! Please sit down. I understand you, you know ? You have scruples about Giacomo, but the enemy's the enemy. Let's say adversary. The machine's already moving ! - What machine ? - The organizational machine ! Tomorrow you'll lead the "No Petrol" march to the oil well. A march ? Isn't that too much ? We were tough at the stadium ! No, we have to make a strong move. Once Tough isn't Enough ! - Tomorrow at 8, behind the church. - At 8. - I'll be waiting ! - Okay. - Elena... - Goodbye ! Don't worry, it can happen, you're stressed out. In fact, with all this going on... Can I tell you something ? I don't really understand what you "No Petrol" people want. How does oil bother you ? That's not it, there's a problem. I didn't say anything because with your mother... - What about my mother ? - The whole town would know. I wanted to tell you that... it's our oil. - What ? - It's our oil. Meaning ? I gave Giacomo a loan, you asked me to help him ! Sure. -But things started collapsing and... -Things started collapsing ? It's ours, we have to celebrate, I'll call Tito. No, don't tell anyone, how will it make me look ? What's the harm ? You just helped a friend. Yeah, but now I've passed to the wrong side, and I've always been on the barricades. Elena, I was saying... I've always been on the barricades. Of course. But now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I am anymore. You're still Ermanno, wherever you are. We're rich ! No Petrol ! No Petrol... Oil is a tough one, because you have to court it, like a beautiful woman, it has its timing. - Oil... - Come, focus on the demonstrators ! We're facing some demonstrators, Councilor Brugnotti's here too . To safeguard the nature and the water table at Sant'Ugo, no petrol ! No Petrol ! No Petrol... I'll break Brugnotti's neck ! Come on! Stop ! Now a word from our president, Ermanno Sangalli. Make them respect you! Friends, comrades... Sorry, can I say something ? - Listen to me ! - Stop ! This is a democratic country, let's hear Giacomo. Thank you. I want to say that this oil well will bring progress, development and jobs and lower town taxes for Sant'Ugo. Sure, like in Basilicata, they're still there, waiting. - You didn't even ask our opinion ! - It all happened so fast. We can come to an agreement. Look, these people are ranchers, artisans, farmers... How many wells will you drill ? Will you expropriate ? This oil well will give lots of people jobs... Stop the demagogy ! Free Sant'Ugo ! What does free Sant'Ugo mean ? Fuck off ! Close it ! Get back, keep calm ! Watch it, rocks hurt people ! Come on up. Now all of this is yours. It's scary, but then it bewitches you like Circe the sorceress. It's hard to believe. It's an instant, a vision, don't become too fond of it. It disappears at dawn. Like dreams. Have the values of the mud settled ? Is the pressure okay now ? Calm down, Giacomo, by now nature is running its course. So, what have you decided ? - Do I go on ? - I don't know. There's not much time left. Okay. See ? All this is mine ! Yours ? Yes, I mean... also mine. What are you doing ? I love you, Shan. What's this Italian obsession with love ? Sorry, I didn't mean... Don't the Chinese ever fall in love ? Sure, sometimes, but it's not so important. Being friends is important. Don't friends ever kiss ? What are you doing ? These sofas go in the warehouse. - Who's she ? - A friend of mine. - Hello. - Do you work for "Puffs and Sofas" ? No. Put it with the others for the Pescara Fair. Sorry, he's my father... Pedal, get movin' ! What are you going to do ? No, your father will kill you. Sharing minds ! Jump on a sofa, we'll surround him ! He's ours ! You bastard ! Come just a little closer again. Dammit ! I'll be back for you. - Where are you going ? - To the cafe. He said you're looking well, not that you're in good shape. - Right, we need to celebrate. - But not a doughnut ! You're so boring, I'll pick up my tests alone next time. There he is, it's him. - Who ? - Mr. Lombelli, the engineer. - A handsome man, he has charm. - Yes. You can tell he's American. - My dear Sangalli, my dear Ranieri. - Hello, Mr. Mayor. I asked you here to restore peace and order, for the good of the town. Please sit down. How long have we known one another ? Be serious people, we must defend what our land has given us. Given... I invested money, I even mortgaged my home. No one's saying you didn't, Giacomo... may I use your name ? Please. We all have to take a step back, you too, Ermanno. We just want some reassurance, we're not irresponsible. I can give you that. Things should be done gradually, together, in synergy, so we want to help you, support you, maybe with one of our subsidiaries. Don't misunderstand, it's not that I don't trust you, but you're going from sofas to oil... And you from politics to business ! No, you're wrong, this is a common good. You'll need roads, storage systems, transport of the oil... Besides, I think you still don't have an upstream license, our opinion in the subcommittee could make the difference. I see, we can talk about it. No way, these guys want to steal the oil. Sangalli, what's wrong ? You should be pleased. - Hold your men and leave it to me. - To you ? The oil's ours ! Ours ? It's his too ? Really ? I can't believe it ! It's true, by now the whole town knows, he even went to the Mayor. Ermanno is a partner, just like Giacomo. Wasn't your son-in-law a revolutionary with the protestors ? Right, I've never liked that guy. In twenty years, never once in church. I don't get it, is Ermanno an oilman or a revolutionary ? Who knows, it's all a big mess today. How'll it end up now ? Here he is ! - Judah ! - Traitor ! - I can explain. - Traitor ! Hi. - Let me talk. - You're a double-crosser. I did a friend a favor, I didn't want to get into the deal. What a liar, then why didn't you tell us ? I thought they'd never find a thing, but maybe some good can come of all this. If we manage the oil, it could be a resource for the country. You talk like Giacomo. They won't let you, when there's money, the top men gobble it up. - Not for us, I promise. - Promise ? You're a nobody. You're crooked, like all the others, you betrayed us. It's disgraceful ! Clown ! Betrayer ! We of the "Petroleum Oil Company" thought we'd do some drilling here... here and here, like Engineer Lombelli suggested. Naturally we'll have to open a road all along here. It's all state-owned land, isn't it ? Not all of it, some is private. Whose is it ? My family's. It's important, that's why you're here, to end the protests and see that all the procedures are respected. Of course, one of our members will certify all the work. Because this town deserves the best, right, Mr. Ranieri ? Mr. Mayor, that's why we're here. What were you doing with the Mayor ? That's what we wanted to talk to you about. I'm here. We received a proposal. "Petroleum Oil" made a bid to pick up everything: the well, the drilling plans for the whole area. It's a very advantageous offer. True, but now the cooperative hates me, no one says hello in town, to win back their trust, I have to do something great, the common dream: oil. It's too big for us, the mayor will never give us his support. My friend, it was a nice adventure. Now they're offering 3 million euros. It couldn't be better, listen to 99% ! I don't care about your 3 million euros, I betrayed them. If we keep the oil, we'll go for the town's interests. You said so yourself: the common good, remember ? C'mon, they'll stop us when they want and the well might even run dry. - Crap, you just want to con me ! - I'm selling. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You can't sell anything, you don't have a majority. The others are with me. They are ? Let's count heads ! It's all in your hands now, Giacomo. I joined the cooperative because I felt protected, safe, like at home. But in just a few months, everything's changed. I never thought it would come to this, we're acting crazy ! Too bad, we could start over together. If only you trusted others more... Start respecting others yourself. I did what I had to, you're the same old idealist ! Better an idealist than an asshole, keep my share and fuck off ! Holy shit, what made us like this ? In 1951, we were down and out, but when the flood came, we got down to work, all together, and saved the town. Now for a little spurt of oil, we're in a tornado ! Please, Cecco, you too... Ermanno, all I can do is make sofas. Judah ! - Stop ! - Are you nuts ? - Judah ! - Get out ! - You're chicken ! - Dickhead ! - Chicken ! - Dickhead ! - Leave me. - No. a month later Ermanno, Tito would like to tell you something. Pass the salt ? The salt ! Bye ! You're taking your old equipment ? They all play, maybe I'll get to join a game. - I'm shitting my pants ! - Me too. - But we made the right decision. - You did ! Be good, you guys ! C'mon, help with the boxes, and come to visit ! Shan wants to return to China, I'll come alone. Shan, Santo Domingo is cool ! I have an audition for the Premier League. So, you'll be in the big leagues ? That's cool ! Giacomo ! Hi, come on in ! Thank you. How's he doing ? So, so. I've given up. He doesn't talk, doesn't go out, yesterday he even said he wants to leave Sant'Ugo. Really ? Ermanno, Giacomo's here. Listen, everything's settled at the bank. Thank you. C'mon, come inside. No, I'd rather stay here on neutral territory. Talk to him, go on ! What do you want ? - I was passing by. - And so ? - I wanted to know how you are. - Just great, lovin' life. - Listen, I thought that... - What ? Nothing. I'm glad you're feeling good. I'm off. - Bye. - Bye. - I'm off, bye. - Bye, don't stay out late. No, it's a quick thing, then I'll be back. Dad, I said "bye" ! Bye. Dad, shit ! Listen, you didn't betray anyone. We need you in the cooperative. Tito's right, you have to stop this, react, we can't take any more ! Where did he go ? To the cooperative. Things are starting to move again, you have to go too. No way, after what happened, they can't stand me. Anyway, there's Giacomo, Paola... They've all left. - What ? - We tried to tell you so many times. They've gone, only Cecco's left. What bastards, they left with the oil money ! Pieces of shit ! Friends... Friends my ass ! Still on these comics ? Yes, they're going great. They're nice, there's something about them. It went really well at the Fair, I have loads of orders. You think we're jerks but instead... This one's nice ! It looks a little like me. That's Kobo. He's a complex character, he has a double soul, intelligent, wise, but a terrible pain in the ass. Dad, you see things only from your viewpoint. - The right one. - No, the old one. - Know what the Orientals say ? - You lost it for that Chinese girl ! They say: "Instead of damning the darkness, light a candle". You thought it was over ! I've been waiting for this moment. Now I'll drink your blood. Leave him to me, we have unfinished business. Come on, little guy ! Square off, you ugly moron ! Say your last prayer, twit ! Raki, watch out ! Take this ! No ! Good boy, Rigoletto ! Cecco, what's today's forecast ? Tito, the alarm ! - What is it ? - Come on ! - What's going on ? - I don't know. It stopped ? Go up there ! What's going on ? - Close the valve 7 ! - What's going on ? A sudden drop in pressure, it's stopped pumping. The oil's run out. - You knew it, didn't you ? - What ? - That's why you sold. - No, Sandrone. - I never thought you were so clever. - I didn't know... You just looked after your own interests, I'd have done the same. - We'll wait for you over there. - But... - Cecco... - Good man ! It's not true, I swear ! Tito, tell them ! Ermanno... Cut it out or you'll convince them ! You were right, the oil well ran dry. I'm always right. Almost always, but you didn't want to listen. Lombelli is never wrong ! 99% ! I may have lost some credibility, but what satisfaction: a giant kick in the ass of a big company. Lombelli thought the well would run dry, sooner or later, the geyser was too strong, so it had to be sold fast. Understanding oil is an art, like with women. It's a mystery that's bigger than us. Hi ! - Hi, Paola ! - Hi, Paola ! Ermanno, I finally discovered my dream. To stop, live a peaceful life and stop chasing after nothing. I guess I'm the only idiot, you left me alone with the sofas. We had to play a few tricks and you have one flaw, you're too honest, Ermanno, too honest ! Let's go, Tito ! Dad ! My hero's great. And so, at the end of the story, everything went back in place. Now the disorder was perfect. PARTLY CLOUDY WITH SUNNY SPELLS
