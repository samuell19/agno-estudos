How in the hell are we gonna push drugs if we don't have any pushers? - Hello, daddy. - Hi. - Are you being cross again? - No, no, of course not. I was just having a friendly chat with my associates here. - Well now, daddy. I shouldn't really keep you gentlemen from this business. But I saw the most exciting and adorable bikini at Lane Crawford. - Oh. - Just what I need for our vacation in Manila. - Okay. - And... Oh, daddy, you're so sweet. Toodle-loo. - Toodle-loo. - Hey. - Toodle-loo yourself, you jerk. - You creeps have just 'til the end of the month to straighten out and shape up. When I come back from Manila, I expect to see results. They don't call me the Devil for nothing. You'll get nothing but holy hell from me if business doesn't start to pick up. Now get out. Get out! (tense music) - He's too powerful. - He owns everybody. Yeah, he even owns us. - Yeah? But he don't own that bottle, and neither do you. - He's like Jekyll and Hyde, that guy. - Yeah, one minute the devil, the next minute, some kind of angel. - Somehow we gotta get this guy. - There may be a way. - Come on, come on, talk. - Okay, now here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get together and... (upbeat, funky music) - Toodle-loo. Toodle-loo-hoo. Toodle-loo, Debbie. - Toodle-loo yourself. - Remember me? I work for your father. - Are you his interior decorator? - Heaven's no. I'm his head of construction. - [Debbie] How heavy? - Oh, very heavy. - You could've fooled me. - I fool everyone. - Yeah, I remember you now. At my house the other day, yeah? What ya doin' here? - I'm building a bridge. - Building a bridge? To where? - Hong Kong. - Building a bridge from Manila to Hong Kong? You've gotta be kidding. - Oh no. Oh your old man is very ambitious. Want to see it? I have some of the sketches. - Oh, some other time. (upbeat music) A bridge to Manila? From Hong Kong to Manila? What a kook. - Excuse me, Miss Devlin? There is a gentleman waiting for you by the locker room. - Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo hoo! Yoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Yoo hoo! (chuckling) - Must be one of daddy's jokes. Probably. Oh well. - Yoo hoo! - Alright, now what's this? (screaming) (tense music) - I told you I fool everybody. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Manny] Uh, Devlin, this is Manny. - Yeah, Manny. - [Manny] Well I just wanna tell ya that we got your daughter, Debbie. (tense music) - What is this, Manny? Some kind of a lousy joke? - No joke, Devlin. We want a million dollars cash and complete control of the operation with you out. - Now listen here, Manny. - No sense in losing your temper Devlin. I'll tell you right now that we mean business. - Daddy! Daddy, please. - Now listen here, you bastards, if you lay a finger on-- - Be reasonable, Devlin. Nothing's gonna happen to Debbie if you deliver the money. - I'll need time, Manny. - Sure, you've got 72 hours. We'll be in touch. - Operator. - [Operator] Yes, sir, this is the operator. - I'd like to place a long distance call to Singapore. Her name is Cleopatra Wong. Interpol Exchange or somethin'. - [Operator] I'll try there, sir. (phone ringing) (hitting) - Hello? Yes? Yes. Yes, she's here. (hitting) Cleo? Hold the phone. Miss Wong? Overseas calls for you. - Thank you my friends. Thank you. Alright. - [Lucifer] Miss Wong? - What? Speak up. - Devlin. - Who? Lucifer Devlin? - [Lucifer] Yes. - Is this some kind of joke, Devlin? What the hell? - Cleo-- Miss Wong, I need your help. My daughter's been kidnapped. - Why don't you call the cops? - Now you know damn well I can't go to the cops because of this. Hey look, I'm sorry. I just can't explain the details of this thing on the telephone, but I'm desperate enough to give you anything you want. - Anything? Listen, Devlin. This had better not be a trap. - No trap, no trap. I give you my word on that, no trap, I swear it. - [Cleo] Where are you now? - Manila, Philippines. Ramada Hotel. - Got it, I'm on my way. - Miss Wong, your attache. - Thank you. (laughing) - A bridge to Hong Kong, huh? I never thought she'd fall for that one. (hitting) - Damn, we got the Devil by the horns. (laughing) - While all of you guys are cackling like a bunch of old hens, my father is no doubt on his way to tar and feather you. And get those damn lights out of my eyes, Hookie. - Hookie? (tense music) Hookie? - [Debbie] Aren't we sensitive? - I'll show you what this hook can do. - Easy, Manny. We need her. - Sit down. Please. Listen... Debbie means more than anything to me. Even life itself. I swear to God, I'll give you anything if you can get her back safe. - I did hear you say anything? - Yes. And my word of honor, whatever money it takes. - I want more than just money. (laughing) What are you laughing at? - I was just thinking about the irony of all this. Here's the devil, making a pact with you, for his soul. - I don't want your soul, Devil. I want your hide, for all the evil things you've done. - Alright. You get Debbie back, safe, you can have me. - And all files and information on your operation. Connections, pay offs, sorted-- - Alright, alright, alright, alright. Alright. It would be worth it to see those treacherous bastards nailed. - You taught them well. - Not like what I'm gonna teach them when I find-- - That's my job. And I think I'm going to need help. - I told you money was no object. But who are you gonna get that's not known to my people? - It will have to be someone unusual. Someone your goons would never suspect. And I think... I know who. (upbeat, funky music) - Hi, there, everybody. (whooping) (upbeat, funky music) - [Man] Hello, Terry darling, oh you're magnificent tonight. - [Woman] Yellow and green, you're simply supreme. (upbeat, funky music) - Wow, he looks like a freakin' canary. (laughing) - Oh you're just angelic. Ah! A ghost. A Crimson cocktail, Freddy. - What? What happened to the Brandy Alexander? - Oh, Freddy. That would never go with yellow. (laughing) - Wow. (upbeat music) - I told him I wanted extra fullness in the sleeves. - Hi Terry. Remember me? - Ah. Oh, remember you? Well how could anyone forget the notorious-- - Shh. I'm incognito. - Oh, I love it. I must try that some time. Oh, what brings you here of all places? Are you trying to pass here? - I have to talk to you. - Shh, careful. You could ruin my reputation. Let's go grab a table over there, okay? (upbeat music) (laughing) - Hey, Terry, isn't your lady friend a little out of her territory? - Go mind your own damn business. That is if you have it, scoot! - Oh. Maybe he's putting us on. Maybe she ain't a lady at all. - Yeah, maybe. - Is this real? - You scumbag. (yelling) (hitting) (upbeat, tense music) (yelling) (crashing) (yelling) (upbeat music) (scuffling) (yelling) (upbeat music) (yelling) (hitting) (yelling) (grunting) (yelling) Ta da. Well thank you, my lady. It's terrible the way they come in this place. - I see you haven't lost your touch. - Ha, if it weren't for my touch, I'd still be on the force, Cleo. - I didn't mean that touch. Has it been difficult for you? - Well, I do miss all the badges and the bullets, but at least I have been myself. It's so nice to be me. - Well I need you now. - Really? Oh, I don't think I can handle this great of a thing. Think of my public. - Be serious, Terry. Remember, I'm the one who turned you on to this cops and robbers routine in the first place. And freelancing for the force never paid as much money as I'm willing to, for the job I have in mind. - Ooo, money. Oh, that's what got me into trouble the last time. (speaker drowned out by music) - Taking kickbacks was your idea. But your reputation around here for being corrupt is very handy, and you have an ear for action. - Yes, I really do have a soft ear. What do I have to do? - Just be yourself, I'll explain. - Oh, I'm so glad. I was afraid you were going to have me get out of this. - Thank you. Keep the change. - I see clusters of gems. Great clusters of enormous, no, no, they are grapes. They are succulent, rare in image. A feast for the eyes. Delicious. I feel the presence of the grapes is very important in your life. The grapes symbolize bountiful futures and a rich life. Yes. - It looks to me like your grapes are on fire. - Oh, shit. Cleopatra Wong, I should've known. - You should pay more attention to your customers. - That's okay, you still got your fortune told. - Let's talk about your fortune. How is it? - I'm eatin' it. - That's what I thought. You want to make some real money, Rotunda? - Are these rubies or are they grapes? What do you think? - You know, sometimes I really don't understand you, Rotunda. You're one of the few real and gifted clairvoyants I know. And yet... Here you are, wasting your time on this sideshow stuff. - What else can I do, Cleo? And besides, how often do I get a chance at police work? - Only when the cops are really stumped. And even then they're too embarrassed to call on you for your ESP. - So, here am I. All 305 pounds of me. - Okay. I've got a really good one for you this time, Rotunda. And this'll pay those grocery bills of yours for a long time. - Whoa, that much? What the hell do I have to do? Rob the Vatican? - Nope. - Strangle John Travolta? - Nope. Just a simple kidnapping. Or... Maybe not so simple. - How come there's so much money in it? - I made a pact with the Devil. - And this is the best you can get for what I'm paying you? - This is the best, period. If these people seem unlikely to you, they'll seem unlikely to everybody, and that's just what we need. - You better be right. - I am right. Alright, now, to get down to business. Our first job is to find either Manny, Moe, or Jack, and hope that they will lead us to where Debbie's being held. All these men have business interests here in Manila, so at least that gives us some places to start looking. Terry, you'll hit the hooker bars, and try and get a handle on Manford "the Hook" Spinel. Look for a bearded guy with a hook for his right hand, and that'll be Manny. - A hook? Oh my. How nasty. - Rotunda, you cover the gambling joints in hopes of getting a clue to Moe. He's known in the rackets as Morris "Casino" Jones. Keep your eyes and ears open. - Not to mention her mouth. - I'll track the pushers and drug connections for a lead on Jackson "the Horse" Navarro. Okay, let's get to it. - Wait a minute, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? - I can think of something. - Now, the three of us will rendezvous later to compare notes. - Where will we meet? - I know this great restaurant. - [Terry] I bet you do, big baby. - Right. - If you want to rendezvous with me later, I'd be happy to give you a try. Hm? (people talking) (country music) - She's all uptight. She's looks like she's strung out. - [Man] Stay away from her, she could be bad news. - I think I'll go on over and check her out. (country music) Need any help, lady? - Yeah. - What do you need? - You know what I need. (mumbling) - That's gonna be expensive. - [Cleo] I know, I got it. - Wait. (country music) I think I can help you. What? - No. I'm new around here. I don't trust anyone. I was told to see the Horse. - The Horse? - Yes, the Horse. (country music) - Let's see your money. No. We'll be there in an hour, with the stuff. (bells ringing) (freights sounding) - Are you Jackson, the Horse? - [Jack] Who sent ya? - Look, I was told you could get me some top graded stuff, and I've already paid. - I said, who sent ya? - Your old connections in Hong Kong. I use 'em all the time out of Aberdeen. - My Hong Kong connections don't deal out of Aberdeen. You just lost the game, baby. (tense music) (yelling) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) (tense music) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) - Dammit. (upbeat, funky music) - Hey, who do I gotta see to get laid around here? - You lookin' for a job? - Oh, I got the job, do you got the customers? - Do you wanna work here? You wanna work here, you gotta see the boss. - So, who's the boss? - Over there. (upbeat, funky music) - Oh, my. What a girl has to do to earn a decent living these days. (upbeat, funky music) Excuse me. I was told to see you about working at this wonderful establishment. (upbeat, funky music) - Sit down now, will you? - My name is Terry, but it's short for Terricita, and I'm a virgin with lots of roughness. - Virgin? (laughing) That's funny. You're okay. - [Terry] Does that mean I have a job? - Not so fast darling-- - Terry, the name is Terry. It rhymes with fairy. - Alright, Terry. Well now, Terry, if you want to work here, I've gotta get to know you. Company policy. - I told you, I have references. - What kind? - Well, I used to work in the oil fields. - Oil fields? - Yes, yes, I used to pump all day. - Pumped all day? Hey. (laughing) Hey, what'd you do that for? - Well, I hardly know you. Besides, you do have a cold hand. - This thing? Ah, don't pay no nevermind to this. Hey, guess which hand's got the peanut. - Oh... I could never guess. - This one. (laughing) - I believe you about the peanut. - Are you sure you wanna work here? (speaker drowned out by music) Well, I give the company approval, but we got some pretty special customers and they're pretty particular, so I gotta check you out. Let's go to a motel. - [Terry] A motel? Right now? This is a bad time. - Don't give me that. - What I mean, well.... I have to go look after my poor elderly mother. Could I come back later? - Hey, you sure you're coming back? - Oh definitely. I wouldn't miss it for the world. You're so cute. Bye bye. (upbeat, funky music) - We're ready any time you are, madam. - Huh? - [Dealer] Do you wish another card? - I push. - Okay, the dealer will pay. 20. I've never seen anything quite like that in my life. Alright, let's try it again. Everybody place their bets. (upbeat, funky music) - How's it going? Good evening. How are you doin'? (upbeat, funky music) - Hi, there. - Okay, big hit. Well? Madam? - [Rotunda] I beg your pardon? - Madam, you must show your cards. (upbeat, funky music) Okay, pay 21. - Thank you very much. (upbeat, funky music) - Good evening. (upbeat, funky music) Coming around. You still playing, lady? - No thanks. Time for dinner. Oh. - Terribly sorry, let me help you. I'm sorry, miss, I'm really terribly sorry. (tense music) - Shit. I had him. I had him and I lost him. - Yeah. Well I struck out, too. He got my money, and left me a load of them at the pier. How about you, Terry? - Well, you might say I struck out, too. Manny wants to take me to a motel, which isn't exactly a lead to their hide out. - Well it's something anyway, Terry. At least you still have contact with your man. - Oh, but that's not the kind of contact that I want. - Since when have been so fussy? - How would you like to be fingered by Captain Hook, Fatso? - Alright you guys, cut it out. We've got enough problems. Let's face it, Terry, you're our last chance. - Oh sure, darling. And once that psycho Manny gets his cold, steel hook into my panty girl, it'll be all over for me. - You know Terry, you could get something off this guy. Maybe I could get a lead. - Of course. Rotunda's ESP. - You mean that stuff really works? - Of course it works, schmuck. And lucky old Manny doesn't have it, or he'd spot that bulge panty girdle the moment you walked in. - What do we need, Rotunsa? - Anything. Anything he's carried out or wanted to hide. Just be sure it's something personal, that he wouldn't be without, you know? - Right. Now, Terry, I want you to go to the motel with Manny. I'll leave it up to you, to your own ingenuity to get something personal off him and get back here to us without getting yourself caught. Understand? - Simple as that, huh? What if I am caught? Oh. Thanks. But I'd rather go to Denmark for that kind of surgery. Oh. Be careful of that thing, it's pointed. Oh, my, you're so masterful. - I guarantee you baby, this is gonna be the wildest thing to ever happen to you. - I'm sure it will be. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Of course, with your customers, this would be the moment of truth, wouldn't it? - What do you mean? - Well, isn't this where I'm supposed to get paid for my job? - Yeah, but I ain't a customer. - Oh, I know. But, couldn't you give me something? Oh, just so I'd remember. Wouldn't it be dreadful if I'd forget to ask and then there wouldn't be anything for either of us. Oh. - Now I don't pay for auditions. - Oh, it doesn't have to be money. Just... Just something. - Get out of there. Come on baby, let's get down to business. - Oh you sex maniac, you. - Oh. Oh, you wanna play, do ya? - Mhm. Catch me if you can. (tense music) (tense music) (glass shattering) (yelling) Ooo. (slow music) - If you people aren't the most incompetent bunch of nincompoops that I have ever seen. I don't know. We have less than 48 hours to get Debbie out. And what have you done with your time and my money? What? What? - This. - Yes, this! I want Manny's ass, not his pants. (phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, I know, time is running out. You don't have to remind me of that. Yeah, yeah, you'll get your money. I just need a little bit more time. I said you'll get it, everything. Everything, everything. Now look, I wanna know that Debbie's alright. Debbie? Debbie... Sweetheart, are you alright? Yes. - What did they say? - It's no use. I've gotta give in to them, Cleo. - Is Debbie alright? - Well, she's alright for now, I've talked to her. - Well did she say anything? - Nothing much, they didn't allow her to talk too long. - But... She must've said something. - Well, she said she was okay. And that until their demands on met, she would be kept on ice. - That's it. Stop the car, right here. (tense music) - Thanks. - I think we have a better chance if we all split up. Terry, do you think you can get past those guards there? - [Terry] It's a piece of cake. - Rotunda and I will go look for a back way. Good luck. (tense music) - Hey, you. - Who, me? - Come back here. - I can't, I'm in a big hurry. (tense music) - I think I see a way. - Huh? - The building next to the ice plant. Come on. (tense music) (hitting) (tense music) - Rotunda, you stay here and keep a sharp look out. - Watch it. (slow music) (hitting) (crashing) (hitting) - Bye, fellas, bye! (slow, tense music) (men talking) - Come on, come on, let's get with the game. - Let me have two cards. - Come on. - Hey you, get us something to drink, on the double. (tense music) (arrow shooting) (shooting) (tense music) - I didn't look. (slow music) (glass shattering) (tense music) - You! - But this time, you lost the game, baby. - The game ain't over yet. Guards, take her. Come on, let's get Blubber and get out of here. - Yeah. Anyway, Manny's waiting for us at the beach. Come on, let's go. (tense music) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) (hitting) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) (tense music) - I can't stand it. (tense music) - You guys go that way, you come with me.

(hitting) Oh, my poor jaw. - Now let's go and get Debbie. - Right. Oh, but Rotunda. - Maybe she's laying around outside? (yelling) (crashing) (slow, tense music) - Here she is. - What made you do such a stupid thing as that? You could've been killed. Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm-- - Wow, what an entrance. - I saw them taking off with Debbie. - Thanks for bringin' down my stuff. Come on, let's go. - Oh my god, I can't believe it. Ooo. - Come on, climb aboard. (motorcycle revving) - Hey, are you sure you have driven one like this before? - No, of course not. - Oh, then what are you trying to do? - You don't expect me to ride on that side, do ya? - Alright, you guys, let's stop wasting time and get going. Rotunda, you get into the side car and navigate. Terry, you hang on to me. - Oh, there you go again. Trying to ruin my reputation. Oh. (motorcycle revving) (upbeat music) - Shit. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Devlin? This is Moe. Just letting you know, sending those characters after us didn't work. We took care of 'em good. (laughing) Time is up, Devlin. This is your last chance. Bring the money to the Fisherman's Beach in Batangas, now. And be sure to be alone, because Debbie is already up to her neck in trouble. (laughing) - Damn. (upbeat music) - How are we doing, Rotunda? - Good. I think I'm getting it stronger. They definitely passed this way. (upbeat music) It's them! (percussion music) - Hey guys, that crazy poncho's following us. - What? (tense music) Goddammit. Hey, what are you waiting for? Come on, step on it, lose 'em. (upbeat, tense music) (car skidding) (tense music) - That son of a bitch almost killed us. I'll get you! Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up. - Cleo, please. - [Cleo] Is everybody alright? Come on, get up. Come on everybody, what are you waiting for? (motorcycle revving) Terry, there's no way. - Oh, dear, now what, darling? - I guess we'll have to hitch a ride. - Oh. - What the hell? - Devlin, what are you doing here? - I should be asking you the same question. I thought you were dead. - Well, obviously we're not. - Well as far as I'm concerned, all of you are dead. I should've known better than to hire a bunch of stupid idiots like you for a job I can do myself. - Devlin's gonna be heading to the pay off. Come on. (slow music) - [Cleo] Can we hitch a ride? - [Man] Where ya goin'? - [Rotunda] I'll guide you. - Okay, come on. - [All] Thank you. - [Terry] You're a terrific guy. (upbeat, funky music) - Hi, Mr. Devlin. Glad you could join our little picnic. Where's my money? - Here's your money. What in the hell is this picnic crap? Where's Debbie? If you've hurt her, I'll-- - Easy, easy, Devlin. This wouldn't be a picnic without Debbie. - [Debbie] Daddy! - Debbie? Debbie. - Help me, please. Please, daddy! - Come on, get him. - Debbie. Debbie. (gun cocking) Sweetheart. - [Manny] I'll pull you away. Come on. Tie him up. (laughing) - [Lucifer] Let Debbie go. - Here, tie him up here. (laughing) - You bastard. You bastard, we had a deal. - No more deals, Devlin, 'cause you're through. You and your pooper daughter are all washed up. No more Devlins. And I've got my money. (laughing) - It's ours, baby. Our money. (laughing) - You no good scumbag. (hitting) (grunting) You're a no good scumbug! (laughing) (talking) You bastards! You goddamn son of a bitch. - Daddy? Please. Daddy, please help me. Daddy, the tide is coming in. - Debbie. - They're going to drown me. (crying) - Debbie! (upbeat music) - I think this must be the place. (tense music) - Devlin's men are down there, and so is his car, but I don't see Devlin. - Or Debbie. They must be in one of those fishing huts. - Come on, let's find a way in. - Hey, hey. I think I've got an idea. Okay, Cleo. Alley-oop! (drum roll) (slow music) (drum roll) (clapping) (slow music) - Terry, you go that way, I'll go this way. - Okay. (slow, tense music) (grunting) - Well the tide'll be in soon. (chuckling) - Yeah, and Devlin's daughter will be out. - The fishermen won't find them until tomorrow. Then they'll know who their new boss is. - You mean bosses, don't you? - Yeah, bosses. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, bosses, yeah, bosses. (laughing) - You animals. - I'm going to die. (whistling) (tense music) (whistling) - Come on. (slow, tense music) (hitting) (hitting) - Oh, ow, ow, ow, oh.

Oh you, Devil. - No, let's get out of here. Come on, Manny. (tense music) (laughing) - It's stuck. - Get out and push it, asshole, get out of here.

Don't worry, it's all over now. Here, let me help you. - [Debbie] Oh get me out of here. I was so scared daddy. Are you alright? - Come on, dig, dig some more. Aw, you poor baby. Are you alright, my darling? - [Debbie] I'm so tired. - [Lucifer] It's alright, believe me, everything's gonna be fine. (crying) Everything's gonna be fine.
