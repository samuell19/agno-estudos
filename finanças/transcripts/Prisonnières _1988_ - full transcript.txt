Got permission to keep the chain? - Take it off! - No... 4877. Take your kit. Go on! That's Dessombes. Oh my God! She's still here. Ladies, I'm Mrs Dessombes, the head guard. We're taking you to the observation wing. There are single cells only. Tomorrow, you'll get your authorized belongings. Get going. Come on! We can't put a child killer in with the others! It's like a convent. Speaking is forbidden. Move it! Here's your cell. Don't climb up to the window. Don't speak to other inmates. Tomorrow, the infirmary and showers. Here, take 2 ciggies. 4876. Sleep, sleep... Tired, tired, tired! Jeanne? Jeanne. What'll happen if they bring her in here? - I'll rip her eyes out! - How'd you know it was 2 kids? - Remember that girl? - Yeah. She's just been tried. - Her mug was in the papers. - I think it was just one. So what? 1 or 2, it's the same. You don't touch kiddies. She's being punished. Is what we did better? Brigitte, stay out of it. Get back to work. Marthe, come on. Hang on a minute! I'm finishing my piece. Sit down and speak to no one. Let's go. I'm ready now. What a nerve! Go on. It's you. - Expecting someone else? - It isn't that. You don't usually come on a weekday. Mum, we come when we can. Of course. The creche and the school are on strike today. So Jean-Francois and I asked to see you. And here we are. That way, you'll have a quiet weekend. It's better. And you won't tell your hubby you saw your criminal mum. Mum... Don't start. Leave Nadine alone. We haven't come to argue. Of course. Well? Where are the kids? You told them I died with your bastard dad. Here we go again. You spoil everything! I bet you'd rather we just sent you postal orders. Because you don't mind asking! Hey, it's thanks to me you both earn a good living. Please, Mum. Sit down, Jean-Francois. Look what I bought you. Pretty, isn't it? Turn round. I'll deal with her. I wanted to discuss Brigitte. The guards are complaining. I'll deal with it. Give me time. I haven't seen that before. Did they bring it for you? Thank me. It's forbidden. I was going to. What's wrong? You're needed in the feather workshop. Alright, then. Take Marthe back. You can stay in your cell. Thank you. Stop! Stop! Leave us alone! Stop! Stop! Stop! Give it back! Give it back! Get lost! Silence! What'll she do to us? Who spoke? Stand up. Did you hear me? I demanded silence. You'll all be punished. You, solitary confinement! You! You! You! It wasn't me, ma'am. Get back to work. The racket occurred in your workshop. But I bet you're not responsible! - I've nothing to say. - That's enough. You'll soon conform. You! Come with me. No exercise time for you! What rotten luck! Why did those bitches do it? I'm writing to the governor. It isn't fair. Sylvie. Fabienne. The same girls always cop it. - She didn't catch me. - You always get out of it. - They'll take our stuff. - I've got plenty. I don't. I've run out of everything. - Same here. No stamps... - Stop. We know who did it. - Let's just tell them. - Come off it! I'm out of grub too. The innocent girls write a letter. Are you mad? We can't grass on them. She's right, Nelly. If you want to carry the can... Especially you, Nelly. Nelly. Colette. Sylvie. We can't go out because of you. Lilia. It's your fault. Alice. Claudine. Hello, everyone! Don't forget my steak. You look pretty. What's going on? Nice scarf. Marthe, can we ask you something? Made that out of your curtains? What's up with her? They're going to punish us in the workshop. I've nothing in reserve. I don't have anything, not even shampoo. And... we're deprived of visits. I won't be able to see my kids. Stop your whining. You must've misbehaved. Write to the governor. No, I know... No! No one's writing a letter. We can't grass on the girls for some soap. Spare us your advice. You act like a mother superior! What's up with you? She's always... - Stop it. - That's enough. We just want her help. Stay out of it! Bunch of idiots! Where d'you get that tranquilizer? What's that screw want? Helene! She's smart, that one. Here, Marthe. Another? You're rolling in it, you are. Shut it, you! How d'you want your eggs? - What are they up to? - Hang on! It's my turn, Marthe. Soft boiled, please. There was a scrap in the workshop. - Because of Nelly? - No. But they're not allowed out. Stop sniffing. Nelly! Hey, Nelly! What d'you want? To have a chat. I'm going stir crazy. I'm too busy to talk. Come off it! Chat for a minute. Listen to the radio. I've got my homework. Stuff your homework! You're a right show-off. Hey, Nelly! I've never met anyone as heartless as you. Think you're better cause you're studying? Fuck you! See how pretty my kids are. - I saw them already. - Don't walk off! Another letter? She never stops. Always showing us her kids' pics. I bet she doesn't have any. Some folks say it isn't true. She's a thief and a liar. That's mad dumping your bloke when you're inside. And you want for nothing! Shit! She's spotted us, you idiot. Pain in the arse! Have it. It's too flashy for me. Don't thank me. My kids gave it to me. It was them earlier? I ought to be happy they've not abandoned me. Like my parents. They could visit you. Abandoning their daughter cause they lost 3 customers! I know. There should be a statue in my honour. For ridding the world of my bastard husband. And for sticking with you. See you. Hurry up! It's the others' turn. Get into your sections. You can't stay in bed. Get up at once! It's exercise time. I'm warning you, if I see you in bed again, I'll report you. Fucker! You deserve to die. That you, Marie-Christine? No, it's Nicole. Damn it! You've changed. Round the other side. Got it? Give it here, you cow, or I'll get you! What a pigsty! Look at it. Disgusting! Don't make a racket! Why are you late? Line up in silence. Anyone who speaks will... I read about this in the guards' reports. I understand now. Making a spectacle of yourself? Well, you won't have any more spectators. I'll deal with it. Come over here. You look a right mess. Have you seen yourself? I doubt it. Well? What do you think? Answer. You'll be downgraded if your cell isn't spotless. Improve your appearance too and stop looking like a tomboy. Follow me to the workshop. - What is it now? - Bloody hell! There must be lead in here. It just slipped out of my hands. Get back to work. I'll take you to the infirmary. I've brought her back. - Keep an eye on her. - Yes, madam. Did she tear a strip off you? Never mind. Get back to work. Marthe, I don't feel well. Really? Hang on, I'll fetch a guard. I'm telling you, it was a work accident. Leave me here. I don't want to go back. I can't stand them! If you don't adapt, you'll be downgraded. Not in group 3. Leave me alone! Wait for the pill to take effect. I feel fine and I need to work for my nest egg, for when I get out. That's enough, Nelly. Back to the workshop! What a topsy-turvy world. Hey, she's back. As proud as ever. Don't forget the girls in solitary. The show-off got let out fast. Scared we'd nick your bread? If they're still in solitary, it's your fault. Everyone's mad at you. I helped you with your work. Nice, aren't I? You in pain, Nelly? I don't want to be alone! They want to bury me. Open this door! Open it! I don't want to be locked up, I don't want to be alone. I can't take it anymore. Help me. Don't stay there! Get away from the door. - Do you hear? - What about you? Move away so I can see you. Madam! Here it is. I've got her now. Tidy this up. You, come with me. We're searching your room. You won't get out of it. - What? - A hearing. I'm sick... Come see. She refuses to go to the workshop. Looking for something? Someone reported you, and not for nothing this time. Give me the letter you're hiding. You have no right. No right? I'll see about that. You'll never know. You've no right, and you know it! No right? How dare you! Take her away. The others ought to see your tidy cell. I was taught how. And to keep quiet when I've nothing to say. Happy birthday, Marion! Marthe, you're a star. I almost forgot. The head put Nelly in solitary. I heard her screaming. Remove that make-up. You look cheap. I reckon you're jealous. Who's she trying to pull, eh? You don't know? - She's got a visitor. - Line up in silence! Creep! Show me your left hand. I'm making a bra for the head's niece. Listen! She told me you'd made progress. Your cell's much cleaner. She's fond of you. - What are you looking at? - I heard something strange earlier. See those girls there? They did something nasty. - Keep calm. - I am! They put some smack in a girl's things. I know them. You must've misheard. Smack too! No one's in solitary. How can you be so sure? I bet some things escape you. - Let's tell the head. - Listen to me. You're in her good books. A girl's in solitary thanks to them! Let it go. Girls always end up in there. If they did that, she must've asked for it. It's an eye for an eye here. What's your problem? - I'll give it back but listen first. - Later, OK? When the sun's out, enjoy it. Don't cry. Prisoners! Want to play, Brigitte? - I'm staying here. - As you like. I think you're done crying. That's a lie! I haven't been dealing. You can't accuse me. You've no proof. What was in the letter? I don't have to tell you. It was for my lawyer. What proof do we have? You ripped it up. Maybe it was for someone else. It isn't with maybes that you can accuse me of dealing drugs! For the last time, drugs were found in your affairs. You know I don't do drugs! I do not. You have met accomplices here. It's a conspiracy! What was compromising in the letter? Answer! No. It's a matter of principle. Be quiet! We've decided to open an inquiry. You're looking at 45 days in a disciplinary cell. The maximum. I'm innocent. Take her back to her cell. Why don't you join in any activities with us? I don't like talking much. I'd noticed. I want to ask you something. I've got nothing to give, nothing to swap. I don't get money orders. It isn't that. Who was the girl on the bench? Is she new? Do you know her? You mean Lucie? - Don't you know her? - No. We're both in the workshop. She doesn't talk much either. Lucie? Thanks for that. I've got loads of money orders. I can give you stuff. Just say the word. Stop eating, girls! You won't get through the doors. The exit's the only door us lot are going through. You know why? It's a double-leaf door. Stop stuffing yourselves. You're big lumps. Big lumps? Go play somewhere else, kid. We've been lectured at for bloody years. A brat like you can't tell us what to so. You're hopeless. Hopeless! No more hopeless than you! Enter. Inspector, this is Nelly Roux. Thank you. You may go. Can I sit down? You were sentenced to two years for fraud. And now you're accused of possessing drugs. The situation is grave. The situation is, the charges are baseless. It wasn't me. You appear to have forgotten the 3 grams of heroin found in the workshop. Did it fall off a lorry? Almost. It's a conspiracy. Is that so? And who would want to harm you? Everyone, sir. The inmates, the guards... You know them. Not as well as you. I'm not interested in gossip. But they thrive on it. I may be in prison but I'm free. More than the guards. What are you talking about? I'm making the most of things. - I'm studying law. - Answer my question. Who would want to harm you? Who has conspired against you? I don't know. That's your job. May I? I'm taking her for questioning. She's improved. She was wild. You've tamed her. Like you wanted. Given your record, I wanted to question you. It's a drugs affair. Drugs? I'm not involved. I haven't had any for ages. Of course not. You went to the infirmary on the pretext... On the pretext? I was ill so they took me there. Yes, that's roughly what I meant. Did you meet someone? You've almost finished serving your sentence. Are you jealous? You're preparing your release. With whom are you in contact? Have you been on day release recently? No. I don't know anyone local. And Nelly Roux, do you know her? - Why are you asking? - She was at the infirmary with you. Did you speak to her? Of course not. She was at the far end. I don't know Nelly Roux. She must be sick. I haven't seen her in the yard. You won't see her again. She's in a disciplinary cell... for drug possession. Marthe, you haven't seen these new pics. What are you looking for? - Want to walk? - Leave me alone. Later. Hey, just leave us alone! I was looking for you. Well, I'm busy. You and me need to talk. I've nothing to say to you. What's got into you? Come on. They're not worth it. Where were we? - Did you tell the cop? - What? - Did you tell the cop? - Are you mad? I'd never talk to a cop. He did the talking. He told me about Nelly. What do we do now? Show me the girls then we warn Nelly. Stop hassling her! I don't see them. And I don't remember. You can't just forget people. Look harder. I don't remember. I don't have a memory for faces. That sucks! I've forgotten. Wait. - She knew them. - Marthe? Yes. Let's go ask her then. We can't do that! Calm down. I am calm. We have to warn Nelly. How? Through a screw? It's risky and would take ages. I don't know, maybe in her grub. I'll take care of it. Here I am. You were told I was coming. Come over to the window. It's a lovely day. You should've agreed to work here. You earn money and the days seem shorter. I don't need anything. It's the night that's worse. You have no idea. It's the walls. They take up all the room. They stop me breathing. Every night, they get a bit closer. They're closing in. You'll see, it'll be easier when you're with the others. You'll hold your head high too. It's different for me. I killed my child. What's this shoddy work? It's the 3rd time you've done the teddy. Your pay will be docked. Want a hand? - I'm OK. - Sure? I've almost finished my lot. I only wanted to help. Who wants coffee? And I wanted to give this back. Don't like it anymore? That's your loss. Want sugar? You don't usually turn your nose up. Found another sucker, huh? Who is it? That girl? The one in your section? Sabine? Stop that! It's our break. What's up? Leave me alone. Lucie, we're putting you on general duties. - When? - Someone will come for you. - Madam, excuse me! - Don't be stupid. What is it? Let me go instead of her. I don't mind if I earn less. I'll be out soon. Lucie isn't assisted. We could swap. Her output is lower. She'll go. I'm sorry but I insist! Lucie won't speak. She's broke. Lucie, go with the guard. Nicole, take her place. Well? What's wrong? Take Lucie's place. I'm waiting. I'll have no savages here. If you don't obey, you'll work in your cell. Work is compulsory for all. Now get to work. Make sure you behave. I'll show you what to do. Here's a teddy. You have to do the eyes and nose. You have different sized beads. For the eyes, it's these. A bit of glue. There we go. What do you think you're doing? Pick it up! She was gonna shout so I said, "Scream and I'll screw you." She had this fab perfume! A bit heady like... Like a weasel! What an idiot! - It smelt great! - Go on. I was in a bad way. The girl, the knife, the car... And only my two hands to do everything! I stuck the knife in her ribs like this... Someone's coming. Take her for a week. Come down here, please. You can peel the vegetables. Then we'll see. They'll tell you. You're in my way! Girls, give her a chair. She's always done it that way. Sit down, Lucie. What's your name? They call me Sabine. See you. That's for solitary confinement. Yes, madam. It's OK. Put something in for Nelly? You little devil! Was it Sabine? She turned you against me. If she didn't, who did? Can't you just forget about it? After all we've been through. I've treated you like a daughter. Unlike those parents of yours. Nothing bad's happened. I don't know... Nothing bad? What about the drugs? Nelly's in solitary! Nelly? What did she say to you? What did she say? Tell me! Just drop it! - You're on your own. - Don't go. You know the orders! You're going nowhere. Leave the kid alone! She won't talk. She should be in the loony bin! The fucker nicked Lucie's job too. - Scum! - You're a fucker! - Scum! - Whore! We're gonna get you. Here's your meal. Hang on! You could've chewed it too! That's the rules! Thug. I'm bloody sick of this. It's my life. It's my life I have to admit it It's my life And this distorted song is me One fine evening The future becomes the past So you turn around And you see your youth Shit! A bone! They want to break my teeth. Nelly's a decent person. It shows in her eyes. Maybe... Writing to her isn't enough. Maybe we should tell her family... or her lawyer. I don't really know. Don't be scared. I just wanted to move your hair... to see your eyes, Lucie. Of course. After so long, meeting you and Brigitte... My son fell like that once. Only it was raining, so it was in a huge puddle. He rolled around in it and then... As it was raining, he got dirty. But I took care of my kid. Look how handsome he is. You can't say he isn't handsome. - He fell... - Just shut up, will you! Don't tell me about him! - Leave her alone! - Shut it! - Bitch! - We're gonna get you! We're sending you to Coventry! - Fucker! - Hey, that's enough. Get out of here! I said, get out of here! Leave her alone. - Get lost! - Defend us, Marthe. Kill her! Stop! I'll speak when you've calmed down. Leave her alone, or you'll have me to deal with! Don't defend her! Come with me. Move, you lot! Out the way! That's how they treat new girls. I don't need you! Stay there, they're gonna lynch you. The screws will let them too. You'll be safe with me. You were scared, huh? They can be such cows. Poor kid. Here, smoke. Smoke. You can repay me. We're the same colour. You and me. You're my skin now. You're my skin. You've got warts. Warts aren't nice. Don't worry, I'll remove them for you. I'll remove them one by one. I'll make you smooth. Say something. Say something! What we going to do about Nelly? We've gotta find her legal. Her lawyer. I'm seeing Alain tomorrow. I'll slip him a note about Nelly. He'll find her lawyer. He's great for that. He'd scare you in those PJs. He'd scare everyone in them! Hope Nelly found the note. If the screws did, we're in for it. Have you found the girls? No? Shit, shit! Forget it. You like the shoulder pads? You're so serious! Why can't we tell Marthe? She's in league with the head. Are you sure? The head asked her to make a bra for her niece. That's dumb! She could just buy one. Hey kiddo, found someone to play with? Getting your trousseau together? That lot are well hopeless. Hey, the bone from the other day. The writing's tiny. "Some girls planted the smack. "Only Marthe knows who. "Brigitte and Sabine." The idiots signed it. I have to speak to the inspector. I'll go ask the head. Please don't. Just take me. I really have to speak to him. Why don't you say he wanted to see me? Put yourself in my shoes. I need to speak to him. Please take me. Know what I need? A man to serve me a half. Not a half! Remember? That bubbly golden nectar! I mean the bloke's big hands. It's been ages since I grabbed some big mitts. I've never been grabbed by big mitts! Hey, kid! - Cat got your tongue? - Leave her. She thinking about her bloke. Huh, Sabine? You haven't had a good snog in a while! Got cancer? Cut it out, you lot. I think she's in love. Fucking pains! You hit the nail on the head. Take the knife off her. I can't bear them sometimes. That's all they ever think of. We're not animals. You have to do something. Send me to the infirmary. I'm not sitting down. Go fetch some oil and onions. OK. I'll ask someone to go with you. Lucie? Go with Sabine, please. They're tiresome but kind. They aren't mean. I can't stand them anymore. You're crying? It isn't that important. - Forget about it. - I can't. Go away! I can manage on my own. What's wrong? Did the screws find the note? Is that why you're crying? Tell me. Maybe I can help you. You can't help me. Just go away. Leave me alone, Lucie! Sorry. Forgive me. I didn't mean to speak that way. But you wouldn't understand. What? I love you, Lucie. What? What did you say? I've loved you.. since day one. When I saw you on the bench. I know this isn't the place to say such things. It's impossible. We can't... Don't say that. Please don't say that. Let me love you, Lucie! Lucie! I've got your mattress. - Shall I put it here? - No. Why won't you let me out? - There's an inquiry. - Precisely. I asked the officer to see Marthe. He's taking the piss! He has to question her, even if she's the head's protegee. You women are so nasty. I prefer the way men behave. A good punch-up, and that's it. Aren't you guards the same? For sure... Take your tranquilizer. Lucie, give me your tray. I'll be late. You haven't touched it. Want to keep something for the night? Your tranquilizer. Can I have another? I'm afraid I won't sleep. Only have half. Or you'll be groggy tomorrow. Thank you. Lucie... Lucie. I love you. I've never... loved anyone... the way I love you. Don't be deaf... This is crap. It's complete crap. It's bloody boring. It's choir practice tonight! We can have a bit of fun. Without any screws! Coming, Lucie? - Where? - To choir practice. Come off it! What? I like voices, I love voices. You should hear us, we're well flat! Come! It's the only thing I like. Their film isn't as good. Lucie isn't coming to see it! It isn't my thing at all. - But now you know us? - Maybe. What planet is she from? Shut it. All right. It's great to see you. Same here. Here. Some cakes for you. They're squishy. Seen my folks? Tell them I got the money order. These aren't cakes, it's fruit! You're sweet. You don't write much now. That note... I've got this new friend. She's sick. They're only giving her aspirin. Find her lawyer for me. - Don't let me down. - You know I won't. Come on, I'll show you. I'd rather just listen. It's all I could find. I love you. What do I do? Accept me. I meant the note. Sabine, come on. Come on! - He isn't bad. - The vicar's cute. You in here? - My angel. - Be quiet, Sabine. I'm not an angel. You don't know me. I did the worst, and it can't be undone. Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. - I just want to kiss you. - You can't. We mustn't. Say you don't love me. I'll leave you be. Say it. I can't. I'm lost. Be quiet. Don't say that. - I'm not allowed to love... - A woman? Not that. I've never loved a woman either. I don't understand it. All I know is... you've touched me. You're young. You need love. My life is over. No, it isn't over. You're so beautiful. I'm sure men have told you. A man. I've only known one man. I loved him so much. It was so long ago. If you've known love, don't reject me. You're always on my mind. You can't stop me wanting you. Prison must be terrible for a young girl. I'm old now. I don't expect anything. Love a young woman who isn't afraid. It's you I love, Lucie. Back to your cells! I love you because I'm me. It's simple. What are you doing? Kissing the costumes! Get out of here and don't be insolent! Fuck you, party pooper! - I'm reporting you! - Good. I'm dying to kiss the governor! Take me to her. She's so adorable. Brigitte! Brigitte! - What? - Denise is gushing blood. - What? - Denise is gushing blood! I don't believe you. We've gotta get the screws' attention. - Pass the word on. - OK! Can you hear me? What's her name? How do the others do it? Eva! Paulette! Thingy! Thingy! What is it, honey? You calling now, huh? It's about Denise. She's gushing blood. - We gotta make a racket... - Got it, honey. Go back to sleep. Come on, girls! Denise is gushing blood. - Come on! - Hurry! Hurry up, I'm dying! Come on! Oh my God! Go get a stretcher. Denise will pay for this! She knew she'd end up in solitary. Annie. Monique. Marthe. Get a move on! - Come on! - Annie! A money order. You can't imagine the racket. I certainly can. - Was Brigitte involved too? - I wouldn't know. But... know what Sabine said yesterday? - I boring you? - No. Like I said, the more info I have, the more I can help you. - Well... - So tell me. Apparently, Denise perforated her stomach. She swallowed a razor blade and got sent to Fresnes. Where her bloke is. - Did Sabine tell you that? - Yes. Do you mean Marthe? Yes. Watch out, she's a grass. She works for Dessombes. Don't trust any of those bitches. They want us to fall out. They make me sick sometimes! You've got makeup on. You don't need to. You're beautiful. I adore you. I didn't think you'd notice. I know you by heart. Here. You thought of me? I think about you all the time. Are you nuts? Not here. - You're being careful now? - We have to be. Especially here. If I wasn't, know what'd happen? - Want to know? - Yes. I'd devour you. And we'd end up in solitary. Take your curtain down, love. I'll sort it out for you. Dolling yourself up? No. My hair's in my eyes. Stop that racket! - Can I come in? - Yes. Make me a coffee? If you like. You've got an inch plant? I don't remember seeing it. I've not had it long. Oh gosh! I'm out of sugar. - Sorry. - I'll go get some. Why are you here? You know very well... Get with it! Tell me... Has Lucie got herself a hubby? You're clueless, huh? For Nelly, it's OK. I heard she got the note. - Do you need the infirmary? - No, I'm OK. I was just feeling a bit dizzy. Sorry. Escape? She's totally mad. That's the last wall. I just need to find out if there's broken glass on it. It's pretty clear. It couldn't be clearer. Now I have to hide it. The screws better not find it. Get lost, you! Thief! Bloody thief! Tell me again. Your memory's lousy. - Once I'm out... - What's his number? 278 84 66. I give him your map and tell him to wait for you. Near the kitchen wall. That's it. He's to tell my parents to send me a money order. And he's not to visit me. Imagine I'm on the wall and the screws want to take me to the visiting room. It'll screw up my plan! Hey, is Lucie up for it? Sure. She's amazing. She's my darling. I'd give her the world. I want her to be happy. I want to take her far away from here. To another country. I love her. No one else counts. - I hope it works. - Excuse me. I wanted to soak my scarf. It'll get ruined in the machine. That's Marthe's scarf. I've been let down as usual. Some girls say it's tough when you get out. I could give you my children's address. It's OK, I'll manage. Of course you will. I had a good teacher. Prison changes you too. That depends. I've learnt about life. I want to live better now. That's good. What's life after all? See you. I've something to tell you. Give me the ball! Get a move on! Sabine? All set then? I go with Alain to see Nelly's lawyer. - Brigitte's leaving. - Already? Time plays tricks on us. We run, we escape. I'll send you news. They're waiting for me. See you. I don't ever want to leave. Are you mad? We've got to get out. It's all sorted. Remember the cellar? I left some ropes in there. We'll be out soon. Trust me. - I'm too old to escape. - Stop, Lucie. I can't stand it in here, I'm suffocating. We'll be found out if we stay. We have to go. We'll be together outside. Whatever you say. You're all I have. But outside scares me. You see... this is my home now. I'm used to it. I won't know how to live outside. I have nothing. Will you still love me outside? Get a move on! - What's up? - Searching for someone. The light's hurting my eyes. Do something! Is that better? It's you! They called you. It wasn't the prison administration. It was... Sit down. A man called Alain brought me a message from Sabine. - She must be an inmate. - That's right. - She helped me. - Tell me everything. What happened to your foot? It was just a work accident. They didn't even report it. But the worst thing is... I'm the victim of a conspiracy. Nicole's got the hang of it. She wants to work. Don't you agree? Go on, I'm listening. The others are giving her hell. She gets no help... Has she had a visitor? - Go on. - That's it. She should be in my section. I could give her some wool. I've more than enough. She does nothing. If she wants to knit... Sit down, Marthe. It isn't Nicole I want to discuss, it's Nelly. The inspector went over the inquiry with me. Did you say anything? I don't know anything. - He says you do. - What's he on about? You believe him? If anyone prevents us finding the drug dealers, there'll be unpleasant consequences. Is that clear? Sit down! Hindering an investigation is a serious offence. - You risk... - Question Brigitte. Brigitte? What's she got to do with it? Go on. Must I remind you of how I make your life easier? The others aren't so lucky. Never forget that. I'm questioning you because I know you well. If you don't talk, you'll see the inspector... Brigitte told me some girls got drugs in. Don't tell me what I already know. I want names. What you already know? Names... As far I remember... Mauricette... - Claudine and Mireille. - Are you serious? They've been released. That's all I know. Since when? - Why hide that from me? - I didn't mean to. - I didn't take any notice. - You? You know about everything, and you didn't take any notice? I won't swallow that! It was a mistake, I didn't mean to hide anything. I don't believe you. - Who do you think I am? - Give me another chance. Give me time and I'll find things out. Certainly not. Let's not fall out over Nelly. Girls end up in solitary for less. I hate the bitch as much as you do. Be quiet! Did you leave your place at any point? Yes, when I went to the infirmary. For your foot? Do you remember what happened? Not half! I got hit by a heavy box, I thought I'd broken something. How did that happen? Did someone push the box? Marion dropped it by accident. No, she did it on purpose! So I'd leave my place. When I got back, she was in my place. Marion? Marion. All right. I'll go see the inspector. You'll be out in no time. - Marion, come with us. - No, not me. Don't act innocent. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. It slipped out of my hands. The drugs weren't my idea. It wasn't me! I swear. Because of you, a friend of yours was in solitary confinement. She's no friend of mine. We were all glad she was in solitary. You're going to find out what it's like now. Oh no... not me. It wasn't my fault. I didn't do it on purpose. Wretch. That's right, my dear. You'll need the stick for a while. Your foot will be fine... but it'll take a while to heal. Nelly, you'll sleep here tonight. You'll see the orthopaedist in the morning. And you're changing workshops. But you won't work until you're fully recovered. That boss of yours could've told me herself! They're her orders. What a bitch! Try to calm down. You need to rest. No! Leave the door open. We'll get caught. These girls are rubbish. - I can manage on my own. - Leave it. You shouldn't do choir practice but the French cancan! - Want a tomato? - Thanks. Sabine, close the window. Sabine. Come with us. - What? - What do they want? Get back to work! We'll be late. Lucie, get down at once. Right away. Where are we going? - Lucie Germont? - Yes. Sign here. You've got a remission because of your good behaviour. When will I be released? In less than a month. Let's go. Weren't you expecting it? I don't want to leave. We'll prepare your release. - We'll find you a hostel. - I don't want to. Don't say that. Your good behaviour was taken into account. - Do you want to rest? - No. I'm serving in the refectory. - I have to go. - Goodbye, then. There's a letter in your pocket. Get the others to sign it. A letter? - Group letters are forbidden. - It's for Sabine. I can't stand her, she's disgusting! Shut it! What's going on? Calm down. No one will sign. They're hopeless. Sign what? - Sabine's in solitary. - What for? We don't know. An escape plan. How do you know? I don't know. Fuck you! Marthe's for it now. So it was you? You snitched on Sabine. It was you! Let it go. I'll deal with the bitch. The bitch here is you! Fuck the lot of you! I'm not scared of you. Why did you snitch on Sabine? You disgust me! You love sending girls to solitary. You're absolute scum. And you're a shrew. You've been brought down a peg or two! Who's she sleeping with? I know her game. I'll find out. Don't gawk at me, you! No one fools me. I've figured you out. You act like a saint but you're a sex maniac. She's stopped seeing the chaplain. How come? You're ashamed before God. Stop raving, spiteful cow! Why did you snitch on Sabine? - What do you know? - I was tipped off. You're telling lies to get at the truth, huh? - Get off! - Separate them. It was Marthe. Marthe attacked her. Marthe? - Solitary confinement. - No way! No way am I going! This is how you thank me? You can't do this to me. I'm not any old inmate, I'm Marthe! And I'm not going. Take her. I won't go! Don't touch me. Get off me! I won't go to solitary! Get off. Get off me! Back to your cells till exercise time. They'll stop the refectory. I could've fucked the blond bloke. - And you? - Yeah. He's better than nothing. I don't want to go! Get off me! Get off me! It wasn't me! I'll get my revenge, bastards! I never started it! It's a lie, you bastards! Get off. They're all for it. - It's her. - They're for it! Again. Why did you call, Lucie? It isn't like you. Are you crying? Do you want a pill? What's wrong? Take me to the infirmary. She wants to go to the infirmary. - Finished your rounds? - Yes. It's against the rules. Come on, I know her well. She isn't putting it on. OK, but if anyone finds out, you take the blame. OK. Come on, she's too weak to walk. Thank God it's almost over. Come on. There you go. Lucie! I'm scared, I'm scared. It can't be true, it can't be. I'm scared. Stop! Why? Who's that? Who shouted? I want to go out! Let me out! Come on! Move it! - To work! - No, not today. For Lucie, no! Get to work! You look better today. Sabine's mum gave me a money order for you. We'll go when you can. Not right away. I can't, you see. Tomorrow morning. Subtitles: ECLAIR
