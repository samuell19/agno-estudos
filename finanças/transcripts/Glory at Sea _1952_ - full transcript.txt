Ship's company, halt! You call that a destroyer? Right, turn! Looks more like Medici power station. Keep silent! By the left, face! Ship's company present and correct sir. Ship's company, standard pace! Here Fanny, take a signal to Winston Churchill... three so-called destroyers in them there islands. You've been done, mate. No politics on an empty stomach please. Got any guff on the skipper, Stripey? A dugouts, so the buffer reckons. A bit rigid by all accounts. She'll be nasty with a bit of sea running. Yes, all of these rookies are in for a fine time. That includes me, guns, and I'd rather not be reminded of it. Seasickness? Merely a question of relaxation. Famous last words doc? Ship's company, hup! Attention on deck. Stand easy please. My name is Fraser. I shan't keep you long tonight. But as this is the first time we meet as a full ship's company, there are a few points to be made. This ship is the United States Navy destroyer Whittier. She is one of the 50 destroyers the Americans are lending us, and we have been sent here to man her. Lieutenant Commander Carson and his officers and men will do everything they can in the shortest possible time to show us the ropes. We are going to work very hard. We have a job to do in the fighting of this war, and the sooner we are doing it the better. There's just one other thing. This ship, as you may know, has been laid up and sealed off for a number of years. And, quite plainly, she is no longer young. However, at this stage in the proceedings she is worth her displacement in gold. With that in mind, it may be worth remembering the usual old saying "never look a gift horse in the mouth." Finally, I'm glad to welcome you here. Carry on, First Lieutenant. Aye aye sir. Ship's company, hup! Fall out the officers. Mach before please chiefs. Yeah, I know... fall out the privileged classes, remain to work yourselves to death. You all heard what the captain had to say, and you all know what it means. No laughing about, no skylarking, and no playing games on the upper deck. - Ship's company, left turn! - Number one. Sir! The next time you report the ship's company present and correct, see that they are. The majority of those men are improperly dressed. Aye aye sir. It's like a herd of cattle, we are. And I'll make sure he doesn't pick on me. Write your MP about it. No use, he's a Tory. Hmm, where do we go from here? Ugh! Oh, thanks for the lift. Don't mention it. See you later. Oh, sure. Who's the midget? I don't know... new boy I think. Came along at last draft this morning. Cut the cackle and get below. And you, Daniels... square your cap off. Service regulations article number 174(3)(a)... caps are to be worn square on the head so that no hair is moved. Now hear this, now hear this. All hands lay aft to the fantail. All British ratings report to the mess decks. You know, I envy you commander. Must be fine to have a whole crew with combat experience. I've got a hundred men in the ship's company. Only four officers and 14 ratings have been to sea before. I'd heard you British were scraping the bottom of the barrel, but... We are. As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here. Aren't you being a little modest, commander? In old age, I mean. No, they belong to the last war... commonly known as Squeak and Wilfred. No, I've been on the beach since '32. I was dug out, as we say, when the war started. Since then, I've been sailing a stone frigate. Stone frigate? Shore establishment. Ordinary Seaman Flanagan, Sir. Chief said I should report to you for duties as Captain's servant. Are you trying to be funny? No, sir. That's what he told me, sir. Say, you are an American. No, I come from Ireland. I see. And what part of Ireland are you from, Flanagan? Chicago? How long have you been in the Royal Navy? Four Four months, Sir. I enlisted in London. Enlisted, huh? Well, you certainly ought to feel at home on an American ship. Yes, Sir. Very well, Flanagan. I'm glad to have you aboard. Thank you, Sir. I'm glad to be aboard. Now sweepers, man your brooms. Clean sweep down, fore, and aft. You know, in a lot of ways I wouldn't mind changing places with him. I must have cursed this old bucket a hundred times since I took it over. And now I... I think I know what you mean. Well, I'll say one thing for you British, Commander... you certainly don't waste much time. We haven't got much time. What's our position, pilot? I'll get a fix, Sir. Brown, I know where we are and so should you. Next time I ask that question I want a proper answer. Aye aye, sir. Midships, steer 082. Midships, steer 082, sir. Take over number 1. Let me know when you sight the convoy. Aye aye, sir. I wish he wouldn't make me feel so conscious of being a Saturday night sailor. He seems to think I'm not trying. I guess those wavy stripes of yours get in his hair. Starboard 15! Starboard 15, sir. I'm afraid he doesn't think much of me as a number 1. - No. - No, I've counted. There aren't enough ships to go around and have command of my own. Midships, steer 096. Midships... Why don't you turn over now. He wants me to plot the latest u-boat dispositions. I never get a minute of peace. It's worse than being a school master. Is that what you were? Among other things. Journalism, advertising, civil service... a sort of rolling stone. Uh-huh. Convoy on the starboard bow, sir. Very good! Captain, sir. Yes? Convoy sighted - on the starboard bow, sir. - Very good, number 1. I'll come up. 130 revolutions. Did you get a starsight this morning, Grant? - Yes, sir. - Good. I said 130 revolutions. Now. 910 revolutions a minute, sir. That can't be right. She'll take off at that speed. She'll only do 400 all out. Try again. I'll tell you when. With better engines than this dragging Now! Keep well up. Visibility's dropping. Not a gale warning, sir. Why have the engines stopped? Now what is it? Cut the steam! Pressure's gone, sir. Take over Morgan. Stop everything except the auxiliaries. Any report from the engine room? Chief's coming up from the bridge, sir. Senior officer, sir... - why stopped? - Very good. Make back... Another one just coming through from him now, sir! Difficult to read his light. What's the trouble, chief? A joint burst in main steam pipes. I can't move the engines until it's repaired. Senior officer again, sir... if delay is serious, proceed independently to London directly. Your present position is... I'm afraid we couldn't read any more, sir. - Very good, yeoman. - Number 1? Sir? Secure all movable gear, rig extra lifelines, - check all hatches and scuttles. - Aye aye, sir. Think you can fix it, chief? Well, we can fix it all right, sir. But it'll take time. Come on now mates! Rise and shine! Starboard watch close up. Come on out and catch a breath of fresh air. It'll do you a world of good. How long before we get on an even keel sway? Probably four miles, I reckon. Come on! Come on! Pork chops and pickles for lunch! Now, now then... as long you don't you bring up that little odd green in your throat. You'll never get it down again if you do. Come on now, boy. Starboard watch on deck. The doctor... I want the doctor. She goes on much longer like this, sir, the ruddy turbines will tear themselves loose. How's it going? We've nearly fixed the steam pipe, sir. Every time she hits a wave she springs a fresh leak. There's one in the stern gland now. Pumps won't get to it. Put extra hands onto baling. Open your eyes. Oh, now! I wish I could be sitting down and get a bit of blooming peace. Up you go with it. Ugh. Well, now perhaps we can get some peace. Number 1. Sir? Exercise action stations. Aye aye, sir. Oh, blimey! Dumb action, dust catching, worse than Beecham's Pills this is! Now then wait for it, wait for it... mail's up! Have you ever put into London Deli before, sir? Yes, once... in '29. Oh, I've been there several times. It's... well, it's not what you'd call a Matlow's paradise. I thought that anything you asked for, Guns, was a dodge ball. Oh, that's certainly nonsense. Excuse me, sir. I'm just going out to inspect the liberty men. Oh, number 1? Sir? I'll take a look around first. Eye aye, sir. Pass the vinegar, somebody. Come on you shore going Romeos. It's Saturday. Us workers want to get in our haystacks. Oh, shut-up. Oh, bug up. YN2 Charville! Here, here I am Will you listen to this. I've taken in a lodger to help with the rent. Well, I've got to go and get his hot water bottle now, so I'll leave you. Love, Elsie. I'm not so sure I like that. I've never had no hot water bottle over the 20 years we've been married. You haven't been around long enough you dirty old man. For crying out loud. What's the matter now? Another strike fizzled out? Yeah, it's this jersey. I can't get it on. Why don't you plan a clover, you twerp. Have you got a skirt? Don't be daft. It's from my mom. Our managing director says life must be very exciting aboard a modern dreadnought. Dreadnought? Hey, Stripey! You know that girl I told you about? The one that works in the milk bar at Plymouth. Oh, yeah. She says she will. Will? Will what? Marry me, dope. That's her. Blimey, what a chassis. Yeah. You know, she's won 12 beauty contests. So that's why he's big-eyed joining the Royal Navy. What a bloke would do in order to be near that woman. And all he goes through for it. What does it get him? No hot water bottle. Gun check! This gun's on safe! Hear, hear there! All leave is canceled! All hands to standby to clean ship! If he thinks he's going to get me working on Saturday afternoon, he's crazy! I guess the First Lieutenant didn't think she had enough glamor. It's not the jimmy, it's the skipper. I don't care who it is. They've got no right to do it. We ought to be allowed to take the afternoons off when in harbor. All overtime in lieu thereof? Ship clean number 1? You have a ready wit Sub Lieutenant. When I was a boy seaman we had a skipper who used to inspect the ship with white gloves on. Sure, in peacetime. But this man doesn't only want the old bucket shipshape. He expects it to be dry cleaned. Can you imagine being married to him? He must drive his wife crazy. His wife, number 1, was killed in an accident two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you weren't to know. Well, I still don't see the point in running everyone ragged the first day in harbor. The point is, number 1, the captain was quite right. The ship wasn't clean except for the engine room. All right, carry on please, chief. Aye aye, sir. Carry on leading hands. Liberty men! Front rank, right turn! Left wheel rank, march! Rear rank, right turn! Left wheel rank, march! Number 1? Sir? I've told you before. Our liberty men are not smart enough. They've had a pretty rough fortnight, sir. All the more reason to keep them up to the mark now. Sir, in my experience, these sort of men have done pretty well in action so far. Surely, that's the main thing. The main thing, number 1, is that my orders are to be obeyed. Aye aye, sir. Pipe. Come in please. Lieutenant Commander Fraser, sir. All right, thank you. This way, sir. That'll be the skipper of the fourth final fliver. Who? Him? The one who get lost? Yeah. Careless, very careless. I want to know what happened to you. I was diverted to go and look for you. Engine trouble I'm afraid. Well, sit down, sit down. Thanks. Good to see you again. It's quite a coincidence. Yes, quite. No, I'm all right thanks. I was delighted to hear you were back in uniform. Let's see, how long is it now? Since my court martial? Eight years. Eight years. On the 9th of December. Makes you realize we're all getting on, doesn't it? How's that boy of yours? Oh, he's quite a big chap now. He'll soon be leaving school. And what have you been doing all this time? I've been building boats. Oh? The first wants of civilian life and all that. Hmm, it wasn't quite like that, no. I've got a cousin. He's got a boat yard on the Isle of Wight. Oh. What about a drink? Gin? Fine, thanks. Watch keeper, liberty men, fall in... What sort of officers have you? Oh, first rate. I have a Canadian number 1 who's very popular with the crew. What's your ship like? What do they call them? Four pipers? Yes, four pipers amongst other things. Well, here's to the future, Hugh. Thanks. I'm sure we can get on all right together. I certainly hope so. Cheers. Cheers. Skull? I have. Cheers. Down the hatch. Action stations. Gin and lime, please. Bright smiles everybody. Say, are you alone by any chance? Yes. You wouldn't care to join the convoy? Thank you. Not particularly. You fellow have no finesse... that's your trouble. And what do you do? Drop depth charges? But you a quid you can't get her to have a drink with you. I'm not in the mood. Two quid? I'll make it three. Well, let's make it a fiver, shall we? All right. Get your money ready, suckers. It would give me a great deal of moral satisfaction, ma'am, if you would have a drink with me. Thanks, all the same. I have one. No, I mean another. I never have more than one gin. Oh, well, what about a chaser? I love a glass of water. I don't think they'd swallow that. Water's is so tasteless, isn't it? How much did you bet? Bet? Pretty obvious, isn't it? One look at your friends is enough? Friends? Yes, in the members stand. Oh, them. Oh, that's nothing. They, uh... it's just they haven't seen a white woman in months. My mother told me never to talk to strange men. Very right and proper too. And what did your father tell you? Being an admiral, he's a man of few words. Look, I know a place where a fiver would buy champagne, soft lights, sweet music, and the biggest steak this side of Montreal. Suddenly, I find you quite irresistible. Oh, it's the Canadian influence. No... the steak. and McConalogue's electric saloon is proud and honored to welcome you to his portals. Now, walls have ears, and I know I mustn't ask any questions. But sure I don't have to. I've only to look at the gleams in your eyes to know that you've been performing some dangerous mission on the broad Atlantic Ocean. Have you? Well, if you really want to know mate, we're survivors. Survivors? Glory be. Drinks on the house of McConalogue. Is there any truth in them terrible rumors about... cannibalism? Cannibalism? Yes, on rafts adrift with no victuals? I wish you had mentioned that, mate. Brings back horrible memory... something that happened to my cousin, Burt. Dear, oh dear. Drink up. Have another. Tell me more. Nasty smell around here. Old food, like something's burning. "Shall we draw straws?" And when I was sure that Burt's got the short straw and he's the one that be it, I says to him, "Burt," I says, "you have to admit we've done it the sporting way." You don't mean that... Lasted us all the way to the Azores. He's a bit stringy, Burt was, but he was sustaining. Lordy be. Funny thing too. We used to complain about his liver. Something men will take pills by the thousands he did. And yet three days after we finished him, we where still trying to beat his liver to death with an oar. Yeah, what do you make of their skipper? The 2 and a 1/2 ringer? Yeah. He couldn't keep a tram on a straight course. She's full of rookies! There ain't a sailor amongst them. What odd luck. Here's for the so-called ship. She might as well be broke up. Scrap heap! From what they tell me, the same goes for the skipper. What'll you have, bud? Pint of black and tan. Pint of black and tan! Coming up sir! How much is that? One for 70 sir. So, I understand you don't like our skipper, heh? That's right. Ugh! Oh! Fight! Fight! Brothers, don't fight amongst yourselves! Brute force never got anybody anywhere! Oh! Hard time gentlemen? Please. Able Seaman Daniels. Able Seaman Daniels, sir, requests for extra pay. What for Daniels. Some of helped to bale out water in the stern gland compartment on the way across, sir. What's that got to do with it. Kings Regulation Admiralty Instruction, Volume 1, Article 1635, sir. "Extra pay at rate side down shall be made to all persons whatever their rating employed in scraping, repainting, or other laborious work in the following confined spaces... Keep silence! The stern gland compartment's on the next page, sir. What were you in civil life, Daniels? Trade union organizer, sir. I see. You were pretty good at it, were you? Well, I hope you'll be equally successful in the Royal Navy. Don't forget that there are certain differences, will you? Very well. Request granted in accordance with King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, Article 1635. Request granted. About turn! Return to the table! Salute the captain! Now don't you go forgetting that again. Left turn! Stand up straight man! Now wait for it... double march! Ruddy sea lawyer. The rest before to serve from Saturday night's fight ashore. Carry on please. Ordinary Seaman Flanagan! Off caps! Ordinary Seamen Flanagan, sir, was guilty of an act to the prejudice of good order and Naval discipline in that he did create a disturbance on shore, namely by fighting in McConalogue's Electric Saloon, Londonderry, being apprehended by the naval patrol at 21:17 on the 28th of September. What was all this fighting about Flanagan? Anything to say? No, sir. I will not have the ship given a bad name. 14 days leave stopped. 14 days. Able Seaman Wood! Place lookouts in the crows nest and the eyes of the ship's hub. Tell them to keep silence on deck. Report at once if anything's sighted. Aye aye, sir. I'll be in the chart house. Boatswain's mate. Sir? Pipe all lookouts close up, keep silence on deck. Pipe all lookouts closed up, keep silence on deck. Have you any idea what we're supposed to be looking for? Oh, yes sir. Two merchant ships... convoy stragglers. Thanks. It does help to know. Hello. Any pings? No sausage. I thought I had a whole bloody wolf pack just now. Turned out to be a shoal of tired fish. I didn't bring my tackle. This is their problem course, sir. We should be there in about 5 minutes dead on time. The question is are they early or are they late. You mean because of the fog, sir? Mhm. What if we circle til it clears? We're fairly sure to find them. That means risking a collision. We could turn onto their course, sir. If we're ahead of them on the same course, we'll never see them at all. Safer to turn and meet them. But we might pass them in this fog and they carry on and leave us miles astern. They're stragglers. They're bound to be late. We'll go back along their course for two hours then turn. Plot that please pilot. Speed... 8 knots. Yes, sir. The mastermind has spoken. Let's hope he's right. Bridge, explosion dead astern, sir! Right! Shall we turn, sir? Five miles. Yes, please. Starboard 20! Starboard 20, sir. 20 of starboard we're on, sir. Bridge! Ship bearing red port-o, sir! Right! Signal merchant ship, sir. Very good, bring her around. Port 20! Port 20, sir. LT RICHARD JENNINGS Midships! Midships, sir. Steady! - Slow ahead boat. - Ask him who he is. Aye, sir. What ship are you? Netherlands bound for Liverpool. That's one of them, sir. I have orders to escort you as far as the North Channel. Have you seen Bostonian? Bostonian torpedoed at 02:45, position 55, 40 North, 21, 50 West. Regret master and 19 lost. Eight survivors on board, three badly injured. Urgently require doctor, please. Number 1, standby to slip sea boat. - Aye aye, sir. - Doctor. Sir? Do your best. Boatswain's mate! Sir? Away sea boats crew! Away sea boats crew, sir. How they brought the good news from that Derry to Davenport. Oh, give it a rest. Let's face it, it isn't exactly what you might call a success story. Oh, you've got to take the rough with the smooth. Things like the Bostonian doing are happening every day. Oh, sure, sure. What's one merchant ship and 20 live between friends? That isn't a very nice thing to say. It's not a very nice thing to have happen either. We should have turned onto their course. Aren't you being rather wise after the event? Well, maybe I am. But I still say the man's impossible. You're entitled to your own opinion about that. Personally, I'm prepared to give a man like Fraser the benefit of the doubt. Well, I'm not. Especially if he's my captain, number 1. Liberty men ready for inspection, sir. All right, chief. and ask how'd you do? I must say, first job we get we end up losing the merchant packet. That's the Navy for you. Aw, pipe down. He's right, you know. I heard them arguing. If we'd done what the jimmy wanted, we'd have of saved the Bostonian and most likely got the u-boat as well. You and that box of tricks of yours was a lot of use. Get your fingers out! Here comes the Swiss Navy! Don't you come near us! It was my fault. I made the wrong decision. I shouldn't have assumed that stragglers would be late. If I'd turned the other way, I... No point left. But on the basis of the facts you've stated here, I think... well, of course, in the circumstance it's quite possible I should have made the same decision myself. But it's just unfortunate these things should have happened now. And the admiral's likely to be sticky one. hands to breakfast and clean. All I know it's not your fault, but we simply cannot afford to put out blacks like we used to. Well, I'll see what I can do. Thank you. So I said I don't care if you've been at sea for the last six years. You keep your hands to yourself. Good for you. Pardon me. The language... there was Brad Blue. Pardon me. Off with you. Yes sir, what would you like, sir? Some information. Toasted or plain? No, I'm looking for Marge. Oh, you must be Flanagan, the Yank. That's right. And you're Glad, huh? She wrote me about you... that you're the life and soul of the party. Oh go on, I wouldn't say that. Well, she told you we're going to get married. Yes, she um... she didn't mention it. Well, look, why don't you sit down. I'll get you a nice cup of tea, hey? Coffee. Oh, you Americans... you do like your coffee, don't you? Yeah, if it's all the same with you. It's all the same with me. It all tastes the same in this joint. One cafe ole. What am I going to tell him? Well, I don't know. One coffee ole coming up. Sure is pretty. Mhm, yeah. All right. Come on, let's have it. Well Yank, you better take a deep breath. She's gone off with someone in the black market. Go on, drink your coffee. Looks like I need something a little stronger. You know the trouble with women? Yeah, men. I'm through with them, I tell you... absolutely through. I know just how you feel. I'm through with men. And that's the last double crossing dame who's going to have a chance to take me for a ride. What are you doing tonight? Tonight? It's my afternoon off. Well, what are you waiting for? Aunt Jones been knitting herself into a stupor. How is she? She's very well. And school? All right. I've been doing an evening course in navigation. Wouldn't it be wiser to stick to your own studies? Well, this war might go on for a long time yet. Mightn' it? Yes, it might. Well, when it gets around to... You want to join the Navy. Is that it? Well... Well, John you... you really must get out of that habit of starting every sentence with "well." Sorry. You see, the plain fact of the matter is that now your away I get down lonely. You've got your school friends, haven't you? They're not the same. That's why I want to volunteer for the Navy now. Now? But you're only 16. Oh, 17 next April. I've got it all worked out. All I have to do is to put up my age, and don't you see it? No. You now what I feel about the service. You mean it's like a woman. You would love her and hate her same time. Hmm, yes. You wanted to go back to sea, didn't you? Yes, I did. Dad. Who is Dave Wilson? Did your mother tell you about him? No, but Aunt Joan said something about him... said I was never to mention him to you. Something about a collision. What exactly happened? I was held responsible for a collision in which we were both involved, and then I resigned from the service. Were you responsible? Let us just say, John, that Dave Wilson would have made a brilliant lawyer. I see. Well... you've got me doing that thing now. But it's quite a coincidence as a matter of fact because Dave Wilson's here. He's my boss. He's Captain D of the flotilla. It's all well, isn't it? All right, and what about the other half of this, hmm? What? Of lemonade? Why are we tailing Charlie again? This makes three nights in a row. Some armchair strategist in Whitehall had a theory that a u-boat on the surface might shadow a convoy and signal ahead to its playmates. How stupid can they get? Bridge! Submarine on the port beam, sir! U-boat sir, red 150! Hard to port! Hard to port, sir! Target u-boat, red 150! Target u-boat, red 150! Load, load, load! Load, load, load! She's diving, sir! They've seen us! Standby depth charges! - Has a steam pipe blown? - No, sir! It's the steam pipes! It's blown! Dammit now! What's the matter with the engines! What is it? Starboard engine's out of action sir! And the port's a bit cheeky too! There's no steam for hunting, sir! Depth charges, sir! No! We'll blow our own stern off! And we're sitting target if we hang about here! Better rejoin the convoy! Aye aye, sir. Try and cool it off. Senior officer reports enemy aircraft bearing 160, sir. Action stations. Aye aye, sir. to starboard. Enemy aircraft, green 80. Enemy aircraft, green 80. Green 20. 30. Oh, there they are, sir! Five of them! Senior officer, sir... take independent action to protect convoy. Very good. Hard to starboard. Pull ahead both. Hard to starboard. Pull ahead full sir. Starboard engine's out of action. Quite. - Open fire! - Fire! Commence! Commence! Commence! We're all famous! Oh, Yank! Good on you! Another engine bites the dust! Senior officer, sir... my bird, I think. Thank you for your help. The lying... He's the senior officer number 1! This is the captain speaking. We've destroyed our first enemy aircraft. And as soon as possible, I'll see that we celebrate the fact. Thank you. Hard to port. Hard to port, sir. Stop port. Stop port, sir. All the truth, it makes me feel almost too embarrassed to enter harbor. Harbor is better than none. Oh, you mean the aircraft. Half ahead, port. Yes. Half ahead, port, sir. Midships! Midships, sir. We can always remember it might have been worse. Yes, but not much, sir. Propellers fouled a boom, sir. Stop port! Who's up? Appleby, sir. From Drummer, sir... pardon me, but your slip is showing. From Trigger, sir... don't look now, but you're being followed. And from Blaze, sir... ta, da, da boom de-a. Propellers fouled the boom, sir. From top to bottom, it's just one darn thing after another. The ensign isn't close up! There's too much water in the bilges! And now, we have to wait 10 days to get into dry dock! And all because one blasted signal was late he holds me responsible for all the female morons in the local encipher office! Well, there's no need to shout about it, man. Now, don't you start. I've had enough! I'm putting in for a transfer! Is that wise? All right, so he'll write me a stinker. So what? He's not the kind of man to do that. Come to think of it, you seem to know an awful lot about him. Well, I ought to. I served with him when he was a sub. The point is, if you put in for a transfer, it's going to cause him a great deal of discredit. Oh, I don't necessarily mean today. I'm going to hit a man when he's down... but moment things look up a little. I tell you this. He won't get another chance to tick me off. I'm going to run this ship like a clock, even if it has got a busted spring. Now look sis, reference 10... will you leave that a moment and listen to me? Reference 1029... oblique stroke, you know... 18 a. About divers! The point is the divers arrived on board hours before the signal said they were coming aboard! The result was a blast from my captain just in the place where it hurts most. I'm sorry, but I wasn't the officer on duty. Well, I'm annoyed, and very unhappy, and terribly alone. And what's the cypher office going to do about it? And when are you going to have dinner with me? Sorry, I'm on duty until 8:00. Fine, I'll pick you up at five past. Aren't you rather taking things for granted? Look, I know a place where we can have champagne, soft lights, sweet music, and the biggest steak this side of Montreal. This is where I came in. Don't look now, but I think we're being followed. Gosh, it's good to see you. I thought you were in Derry. I was. But this is terrific! Let's have dinner tonight. Oh, I'm sorry. Never mind. Perhaps in some other life. Thanks, pal. How long you been here? Three weeks. Well, you must have seen us cavorting about the harbor. You should have let me know. Why? What's the matter? - Aren't we friendly? - No. Aw, now look Joan, I'm sorry about what happened in Derry. But you're behaving like a third officer in the ranks. Have dinner with me tonight. I promise my intentions are strictly honorable. That is, unless I'm given a choice. Shall we say 7:00 o'clock? We can discuss life and things like that. Set 'em up, Ned. All them muscles. Quite deep, Fred. No, don't let them go to your head. Talk. What's the matter with your upper? Who? Aw, don't check your notes. Maybe he's all right. Oh, I don't know about that. He's been sitting there the last couple of hours brooding over some lover... a girl, I suppose. Maybe, maybe. Go and ask him. I'm serious. He's making the whole place miserable. Go on. Go on. What's all the noise about? Why don't you stop being so pig-headed and wake-up for yourself? Why don't you mind your own business? What's the matter, mate? My mum. She's sick. Serious? Cancer. Got a letter from some ruddy doctor. Needs an operation and I've got to give him my permission. What about you? I'm all she's got. Well, when is it? Day after tomorrow. She done everything for me. Well, go and see her. You can have talk with her doc at the same time. Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure. How? Put in for compassionate. I'm not asking no favors from no stinking officers. It's not a favor, it's a right! I'm not asking no favors from that one! So shot up about it, will you? You know Glad, I've always been sort of a lonely person. Sounds silly I suppose, but sailors usually are... lonely, I mean. Perhaps it has something to do with the sea. But that's why a guy like me needs someone permanent in his life just like a boat needs an anchor. Oh, don't talk like that, yank. What's this? Don't say anymore. That's a fine way to act just because of agony doesn't mean I'm trying to propose to you. You're just sorry for me. It's a bit we're both a bit sorry for each other. But we mustn't fool ourselves. I mean, your you and an American. And I'm me, and there's a war on. And any other time you wouldn't have looked at me twice. I... well, I make you laugh, keep your mind off the marches. I still think you're cute. I think you're cute too. I was married in a church over 20 years ago, I was. Seems more like 30. Uh-oh. Hello, Dripper. What's it look like? I'd like to get my hands on the bloke who went to see the skipper. I'll tell you. Yeah, some nosey partner couldn't mind his own business, I suppose. Everything OK, Dripper? Yeah, she's fine. They let me stay until she was safe out of the operation. First time I've ever been in a plane. Well, I suppose you want me to say I was wrong and how sorry I am. Now, Now, don't be stupid mate. You're a Seaman in the Royal Navy. You've got your rights the same as the rest of us. Well, I am sorry, see. Can't you give us some idea of how long it'll take? Well, we'll do our best, sir. But unfortunately, your ship isn't the only one - that needs a refit. - No, of course. Well, thank you very much. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Excuse me, sir. Would you look at these? By the way, I saw Admiral Bartlett yesterday. It was a little difficult. My mishandling of the ship you mean? No, no, no. It's just that you had an accident or two, and he takes rather dim view I'm afraid. I see. Of course, I made it quite clear that the ship was long overdue for a refit. Perhaps he'd like to come and see for himself. No, he's had all defect lists. But it's an awkward situation, which brings me to my point. The building program has been stepped up. There ought to be one or two ships going in a month or so. I should be able to pull some strings. Very considerate of you, sir. But I'd prefer to stay where I am. Good heavens, you'll get a decent ship and a chance of a fresh start. I've already had one fresh start. Frankly, I think you're making a mistake. One has to do what one thinks is right. Well, have it your own way. I've done my best. But if anything else goes wrong, I... well, if you change your mind, let me know. - Any letters? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Any for me? No sir, but there's a rating to see you. You want to see me? I was going to write, but then I thought I'd better come see you and explain. There's no need to explain anything. Golly, thank heavens for that. You look fine. Well, I haven't got used to all these tapes and things just yet. You know, this calls for a celebration. - Where would you like to go? - Well, I don't mind. Come along then. I'll buy you your first tot. And what of? Not lemonade. Starboard 15. Starboard 15, sir. Midships! Midships, sir. Steady! Steady, sir. Any contact? No echo, sir. Did the signal say what the u-boat was up to sir? No, but it'll be a mine layer. To close to shore to be anything else. Where's that bank now pilot? It's near the port side. We're in good 10 fathoms. If they were laying mines, I hope we can pick them up on the Too bad if we don't, sir. Plane ticker, sir, bearing red 55. Stationary or moving? Moving slowly right to left, echo fading sir. We don't want to go any closer in shore. - Got a fix pilot? - Yes, sir. Echo's stronger, sir. Seems to be closing. - Steady on red 45 sir. - Loud speaker, please. Loud speaker, sir. Red 50 now, sir. How far can I hold it to port, pilot? 30 degrees, sir. That's safe for 10 miles. Bring her round to course 065 number 1. Port 20! Port 20, sir. Midships steer 065. Nothing to port coxswain. Midships, sir. Steer 065. Nothing to port, sir. What is that? Echo dead ahead, sir. 900 yards closing, sir. Anything marked pilot? No, sir. Bridge, object dead ahead sir! Hard to port! Hard to port! Hard to starboard! - Stop boat. - Stop boat, sir. A boatswain's mate! Sir? Coxswain, tell the engineer officer to report on the bridge. Tell the engineer officer to report on the bridge, sir. Williams! Bring an inspection light on the ladder up the furrow! Right! Come in! Yes, Grant? That wreck this morning, sir... I should have had it marked on the chart. She was sunk about a week ago, and the position was given in the notice to mariners that I got just before we sailed. And why hadn't you plotted it? I... have no excuse at all, sir. You were on the bridge most of yesterday, weren't you? Yes, sir. And you would have marked the wreck as soon as you had an opportunity. Yes, and the charts are up to date apart from the last batcher. I'm very sorry, sir. Come in. Just being your chars up to date now, will you? The wreck wasn't marked, sir. Not marked? No, sir. Are you aware of the gravity of that admission? Yes. Before you go any further, sir, I should like to make quite clear that I have the fullest confidence in Lieutenant Grant. And I accept full responsibility for the safety of my ship. Are we to understand that you accept the full blame for this accident? That is correct, sir. In other words Lieutenant Commander Fraser, you do not wish to plead ignorance of the wreck's position as an extenuating circumstance in the inquiry? Definitely not, sir. That is all? Yes, sir. In that case, there's nothing more to be said. Very well, clear the court. Well gentlemen, I suppose we must accept the statement that Lieutenant Commander Fraser is fully responsible for hazarding his ship. Thank you. Now Wilson, you've been his senior officer for some time. What are your views? Well sir, ship's records since he took her over hasn't been anything to shout about. But I think it's only fair to point out that it's mostly been a case of bad luck and not bad judgment. Either I'm afraid he can't put forward that plea this time. Spence? Absolutely no doubt about it, sir. Sheer negligence. Oh, come Spence. Don't let that be hasty. After all, Fraser's reputation's at stake. Reputation? Has a reputation? What do you mean by that? Oh, come now sir. What about his past record? Gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm a little in the dark. I think Commander Spence is referring to an incident that happened some eight years ago. Good gracious Spence, it's no concern of ours what took place eight years ago, nor for that matter if the fellow chose to eat peas off a knife at Dartmouth. It's irrelevant and prejudicial to the matter in hand. I'm sorry, sir. In any case, it seems to me that Fraser's covering up for his navigation officer, who probably hasn't got much experience anyway. A lot of these wartime officers arrive in ships prematurely after a very brief training period. Wilson, I'm afraid you're confusing the issue. You're overlooking one vital fact. And that is that Lieutenant Commander Fraser is entirely responsible for the safety of his ship. In my opinions sir, it's a case for a court martial. Wilson? No, sir. In my view, there has been no negligence on Fraser's part. That leaves the casting vote to me. Yeah. And they said, and what have you got there? He said, it's Ms. Shirley's stuff. His smell doesn't look like that. Now ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to give you a toast! Here, here! To the proud parents. If it's a boy, then here's to his first pair of bell bottoms. And if it's a girl, that she's as sweet as her mother. Love it up poor sailors on a night like this. I second that and checked it. - Set apart the motion. - I beg your pardon. Anyway, I think it calls for a reply How about it Glad? Yeah, come on Glad. Come on. Well, I'd like... You see, she's a bit upset. We're going to have to be separated for a while. Oh? Yeah, I've been worried with all these raids and everything. So I thought I'd send her up to Exeter - until after the child is born. - Exeter? Not a bad spot, heh? No, you'll like that Glad. And then yank can come up and see you on the weekend sometime. Sure I will. But it's just I was trying to say thank you for a lovely party. It's been a pleasure Glad. Good luck. I wonder how the skipper's getting on. Yeah. Think we'll hear anything about tonight? I sure do... if it's bad news. Nothing travels faster than bad news. Well come on, let's have another drink while we're waiting. Hey Mack, set them up again mate. It's come through! Huh? I don't know how, but he's got away with it. - No negligence. - Oh, I'm glad for his sake. Sure, we all are. What's the matter now? It's over. That's all. What do you mean? He'll never keep me aboard now. Oh. I've built up quite a picture of my versatile career, haven't I? All the experience I've had, of what a clever fellow I am. What you don't know is that I've flopped at every single job I've ever tried so far. If there was one thing I wanted to make a go of, it was this. Officer of the day sir? Yes? - Captain's coming aboard now. - Very well. Don't mind, I'll go. No, I'm duty boy. - Evening Grant. - Evening, sir. Nice night. Yes, sir. You can tighten up your moorings. Aye aye, sir. Hey, give call! Give call! Everything's OK! The skipper's got off! Everything's all right, boys! Ha, ha, ha. You know what that means. Yeah. We go on acting wet nurse to that floating atrocity. She's got more harbor time than the whole fleet put together. Proper HMS Wallflower. Hey, Stripey. If there was any justice, they'd have beached him. Yeah, not to mention the crew. Glad, you go back and meet me at the milk bar. Why? What's the matter? You're not going to copy this time. Oh, I wouldn't like to be in your shoes. Every column in the book and a civil action brought against you by the landlord of the Golden Bull for good measure. Defaulters, attention! Defaulters correct, sir. Quiet a number of them, sir, I'm afraid. So I see. They'll have to wait till tomorrow, Coxswain. I'm going ashore. He went ashore at 10:00 this morning. It's now way after 6:00. He's probably telling that little Santa Spence what he thinks of him. Yes, well that won't take him long. Maybe he's had an accident. How have the mighty fallen. I should have been on deck, sir. Not at all. Steward! Large gins all around! And put them down to Mr. Appleby. Let me remind you gentlemen of their lordship's view with growing concern the amount of drinking in wardrooms... don't approve of it at all. Steward! Yes, sir. 10 seconds... not good enough. Gentlemen, I give you a toast. Peace in our time. Good night to you. Good night, sir. Your hat, sir. Oh, thank you number 1. Thank you. Good night! I, Edward John Hardy, publican, do herein after agree to waive my claim for damages against any member of the crew of HMS Ballantrae, hereinafter known as "the gift horse," hereinafter to be referred to as "the crew." They must have been tight as lords when they wrote this. Furthermore, I undertake to welcome any member of the said crew to the said pub at any and all times. Given over my hand this 17th day of April, 1941. Edward John Hardy. Witness... Hugh Alginion Fraser. Alginion. Thought you might like some coffee, sir. Oh, Flanagan. Mr. Hardy tells me that you tend to resent adverse comment on my capabilities and about the gift horse. Well, sir, it was just that... Never mind! Never mind Flanagan! I don't like it very much either. I don't like it very much either. Defaulters, attention! Carry on with requestment please. There are none this morning, sir. - No one wanting a draft? - No, sir. All right, number 1. I'll take defaulters. All right, Coxswain. Standard, pace! Able Seaman Daniels... off, caps! Able Seaman Daniels, sir... 1, did create a disturbance on shore namely by fighting in the Golden Bull and being apprehended by the naval patrol at 21:40 on the 16th of April, 1941. All right. Anything to say? No, sir. One day's leave stopped. One day's leave stopped? On, caps! About, turn! Uh... return to the table! Salute the... as you were! About turn! Double march! 4:30 steady 140 revolutions. 4:30, 14 0 revolutions, sir. - Any echo? - No, sir. Lost contact, sir. No wreckage, no oil, no nothing. Just silent sea. And we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea. What's that? It's ancient mariner. Oh, yeah. Echo bearing red 30, sir. Very good! Large hydrophone effect sir, sounds like blowing tanks. Bring all guns on bearing red 15. Aye aye, sir. All guns, lookout bearing red 15. Bearing red 15, sir. Bridge! Submarine flying on the port bow, sir! All guns, u-boat bearing red 10. Open fire! All guns, rapid independent! Commence! Commence! Commence! Eight gun won't fire, sir! Eight gun won't fire, sir! Clear forecastle! Standby to ram all engine rooms. Standby to ram all engine rooms, sir. That what's paid to the Bostonian incident. Stop boat. Stop boat, sir. I had a letter from him this morning. He's a midshipman now. Is his really? You must be proud of him. I am. Well, what I wanted to talk about is this. Commander Wharton's being reappointed. That means there's a brass hat for somebody. But... are you interested? That's very kind of you sir. You are not interested. That's a pity. Because there's a consolation prize. The Ballantrae is going to be released from group for special duties. It's a job for young man. Are you suggesting I'm too old? No. You want to go? - Mhm. - I thought you would. What's in the wind? Search me. All I know is you've got to report to the Admiral tomorrow. And you may god Christmas leave, by the way. Right, sir. Then that's goodbye for the present. Good luck. Thank you. In the south, enemy raiders were turned back before reaching the capitol. There were sporadic raids in the north with little damage and no casualties. A west country town was also raided, but damage and casualties were slight. Slight? Holy mackerel. If that was slight, I'd hate to be there when they really get going. They have a go at you? Not I. Up all night I was in the truck. Terrible mess. to see it. Hey yank! Where are you going? Do you think we ought to try and stop him? I never tried stopping a steam roller. I've seen blokes go adrift before. Now you got seven days leave expiring at midnight December 27. Opposite watch goes on leave at 0900 December 28. So don't let me catch any of you going adrift. Left turn! Right wheel oblique march! Christmas at home, heh? You lucky people. Soon as have New Year's Eve any time. Yank, might be going as well if only he'd waited. Probably saving himself three months in the rattle. The big twerp. How on earth are they knocking down to of our funnel? Whatever the job is, they probably figure it we'll be safe around a sail. You're not looking awfully well, old boy. Hung over? All the way over. I thought, perhaps, their might be some trouble between you and June old boy. No trouble old boy. She's just turned me down. That's all. Oh, silly girl, I thought. Plenty more like her in any case. Oh, very funny! Very funny! We don't only have hammering, we play little games at breakfast time. Darling, you don't look awfully well. I've already had that conversation. We are in a bad mood this morning, aren't we? Why did you walk out on me last night? I couldn't stand it any more. I've been played like a trout for 14 months. Well, you couldn't look more like one. You smell like one too. Anything else? Only this. I don't think it's very nice to propose to a girl with an engagement ring in one hand and a double gin in the other. You were livid last night because I didn't throw myself in your arms and say, darling, I can't wait to marry you. Point is, I can wait. I can wait until you stop taking me for granted. So when you come around to it, just send an uncoded signal in plain language, and I'll take it up with the admiral. Oh darling, in spite of an all-time hangover, I think you're wonderful. Just call me "Alka-Seltzer." I'm sorry to interrupt this idyllic moment, but the captain's just coming on board. This is Christmas, not April Fools Day. So help me, he may be on leave, but he's also on the gangway at this moment. Where's my cap? Hot tip. You said it, brother. When's the wedding? Next week, sir. Sudden death, huh? Utility job at the registry office. Oh, by the way, sir... some Christmas cards and telegrams came for you. Oh, splendid. You'll take Christmas rounds yourself, sir, won't you? I'd very much like too number 1. Thank you. Well, now. Well now, what about another drink. Darling, I should be Oh, this time of night you can't be... No, it's my round, isn't it? Steward? - Coming, sir. - Your round is it? - What'll you have? - Oh. On you? Yes, I'm afraid so. Let's make it champagne, shall we? Four ciders, please. Ready for captain's rounds, sir. What's that? What's that? The ship's company are ready for captain's rounds, sir. Have a drink first. Oh, thank you, sir. Well, Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Then men would appreciate it, sir, if you'd bring the lady down to the mess deck. Certainly Chief, certainly. We couldn't get that in the mess at all. Very kind of her. I'm sure we thank you very much, Miss. Yes, yes. Here you are Miss... got a kick like a kangaroo. Thanks. Thank you. A beer, sir? Thank you, Daniels. Thank you, Daniels. It's yours, sir. All right, get cracky. Oh, not me Stripey. I'm not good at this sort of thing. Aw, just imagine you're on a soap box. Now get on with it. Well ladies and gentlemen... I mean lady and gentlemen. Well, here's to our ship, the old gift horse, and to our skipper. Good luck, sir. Good luck, sir. Skip it up. All the best, sir, and Merry Christmas. Come along, son. The skipper won't eat you. Hey, Drip. This is Ordinary Seaman Duncans, Adams' elite. So you're the youngest in the ship? Yes, sir. How old are you Duncan? 17, sir. I'd like to wish you the best of luck. Thank you, sir. Won't you say a few words, sir? Yes, go on. Well, I'd like to give you another toast to all those who can't be with us today. Our wives, our parents, our absent friends wherever they may be. God bless them. Merry Christmas, sir. Blimey, she's had a facelift. The old bag's lost two of her chins. Six Aye aye... tropical kit going aboard. What's going on? Blimey, what's mean? Pacific? North Pole more likely. Stripey, look who's here. Blimey. Yank. And although you were told you could not be granted special leave, you chose to take it. A man who breaks leave not only lets down his ship, he lets down his family. They're the ones who are suffer when his pay is stopped. And your wife will need the money badly at this time. Has the child been born? Yes, sir. But they were both killed in the bombing. All right, number 1. Put your cap on Flanagan. Carry on. We've been given another little job to do. It'll be more interesting than some we've had and certainly more exciting. For that reason, every man who goes will be a volunteer. And I mean that in the literal sense... not that used by petty officers when picking working parties. Well that's all. Carry on number I. Aye aye, sir. Ship's company, hup! Carry on please, Chief. Aye aye, sir! Right, you all heard the captain's little joke about petty officers. No harm in laughing. Anyone who don't want to volunteer come and see me. All right, take aboard! Carry on with your work! I don't think there'll be any non-staters, sir. Good. Oh, by the way, your command come through... a Canadian corvette I think. Thanks for recommending me, sir. Your relief's arrived at Devonport barracks. He should take over today. Yeah. He's going to be disappointed. I'm sure he is. Prepare ship for see by 0400 tomorrow. Aye aye, sir. Top secret, of course. Yes, sir. Time of origin... 14:25, stroke 12. And June, don't worry too much. Very good, sir. Bye. Here it is... one copy to go to Lieutenant Commander Fraser. Operation Boadicea. Times like these I'm inclined to agree that a woman's place is in the home. Lieutenant Jennings to see you, ma'am. Thank you. Ask him to come in please. High, beautiful! For a man whose been married only two months. I know. Gosh, you look wonderful. You're not supposed to barge in here when I'm on duty. Oh, have a heart. I can't go all day without seeing you. It's asking too much. I don't know what I ever did to deserve you. I mean it. Glad you married me? Even though we're going away? No harm in saying we are going. You cipher office people know everything... probably more than we do. - Do you, by the way? - No. No, I don't. I have nothing to do with movements at the moment. That's all right then. I wouldn't like to think you were sending me to my doom without a protest. The skipper hasn't said anything, but we all think it's the Far East. The Far East? I see. I can't say anymore. You know, this darn security business. I know. You'll be all right, won't you? Of course I will. I think we're sailing first thing tomorrow just in case you'd like to be there to wish us luck. I'll be there darling. I wish you all the luck there is always. Well, don't look so miserable about it. I shan't be away very long. Fraser told me this morning that my command has come through... a corvette. It's just what I wanted. Why it's bound to bring me home in a month or so. Well, what's the matter? Aren't you pleased? Darling, I'm so pleased and so proud. I'll see you later. Company, halt! Commandos reporting from embarkation, sir. Very good, Major. Make yourselves comfortable if you can. Six more MLs taking station to port, sir. Good. - That's the lot, isn't it? - Yes, sir. Striking force now complete... 18 in all. Lower deck cleared of all available hands, sir. Right. Take over pilot. Aye aye, sir. Ship's company, attention! Stand easy please. First of all, you can forget about the buzzes. We're going to raid the enemy. Our objective is to destroy the gate of the only dock on the Atlantic coast of France that is large enough to house a German battleship. The commandos... there are more them in then MLs... will deal with the port installations and hit the enemy as hard as they know how. Here's a rough map of the port. We should be leading up river, MLs following. There are two sandbanks... here and here... which the planners tell us we should clear by about 18 inches. We shall meet some opposition. But whatever happens, our job is to ram that gate. In the bow compartments, there are five tons of high explosive, which will be timed to go off two hours after we hit. So I'm afraid that won't be much left of the old gift horse. Any questions? What happened to our other two smokestacks, sir? The idea is to make us look like a German gunboat and fool the enemy into holding his fire. Any more? How do we get out, sir? We withdraw with the commanders in the MLs. Now, I know how sad you must be feeling at the thought of losing the old gift horse. We've been together for a long time now, and we shall have much to remember. No doubt, people will say that she has been chosen for this operation because she's old and expendable or, perhaps, because we've had some experience at ramming. But I hope you'll believe, as I do, that it is an honor. That's all number 1. Carry on. That's all. Fall out. When do you want gun crews closed up, sir? Not till we reach the halfway mark. I want all hands to conserve their energy as much as possible. They'll need it. Aye aye. Clean underwear. Face it, we'll need it. It's in case of infection if you're wounded. What a comfort you are to have around. I suppose you've been on this sort of party before? Only once every while... filthy business. I'd sooner be a vet. And all groups will rendezvous at this point here. Now finally, the password is "ramrod." Ramrod... and forget it. Will you forward this for my engineer? Yes, James. What's the joke? What sir? Oh, it just hit me. I don't know of being what you call a sentimentalist. But it occurred to me that if we ever do manage to scramble aboard the MLs and get back to blighty, things won't be quite the same again, you know? I know. Close out to operational action stations number 1. Aye aye, sir. Men on the swastika ready for hoisting yeoman. - Aye aye, sir. - Number 1. Sir? I want want all guns crews to be see that the bridge is wiped out. On no account are they to fire so long as the swastika's flying. Aye aye. We alter course for the run in 30 seconds from... now, sir. All gun crews! All gun crews! You will not, I say again, not open the fire so long as the swastika is flying. Too much moon. Dead romantic, sir. Coxswain, steer 114. Steer 114, sir. - Yeoman. - Sir? Up swastika. Aye aye, sir. You can get your men up now Major. Ask them to keep quiet on deck, will you? Very good, sir. Funny to think there's a Jerry working that lighthouse. I haven't picked up the other light yet, sir. If we keep the lighthouse on our starboard bow, we can't be far out. No, we should be at the entrance by now, sir. They didn't spot us. Were you able to check our position, pilot? Yes, sir. We're in the estuary now. How's are depth? All right so far, sir. Another minute and we should have passed the heavy batteries. Coxswain, stop boat. Stop boat, sir. She's clear. All ahead boat. All ahead boat, sir. We still have the other sandbank to cross. How far is it, pilot? Within 30 seconds, sir. Keep going full ahead. Keep going full ahead, sir. We're being challenged sir. Make the German signal "two ships damaged by enemy action, request permission to enter harbor." Aye aye, sir. Duncan, make the German signal "you're firing on friendly ships." Aye aye, sir. We're a sitting target on this damn sandbank. They're a pretty poor shot so far. Signal acknowledged by enemy, sir. She's off, sir. Pull ahead boat. Pull ahead boat, sir. Well done Yeoman. Well done Duncan. - Course pilot? - 060, sir. Steer 060. 060, sir. Blast. Flag ship on the port bow, sir. Yeoman! Down swastika! Hoist white ensign! Down swastika, up white ensign, sir. Take on and train on enemy foxhole. understand? Pelican to the bridge? Open fire! Rapid fire! And Commence! Commence! Commence! Fire! Eight gun, ship target green 50... gun emplacement. Hurry up, let's go. Train left! Arm! Ready! Fire! Starboard engage enemy destroyer at 395! Steam room, check, check, check! Change target to search light... Ship, steady! Ready! Fire! How's Leading up to the point! Ready! Ready! Fire! I hear bombs! Ready! Hurry up, Drip! All right, all right! Ready. Ready, Stripey! All right mate... hang on, hang on. Easy. Easy down. Gently now. Lie back. Now where is it? Where is it? Oh, I'm sorry. There's the light, sir... dead ahead! That's the dock! Clear forecastle! Stand back! No, sir! It's the wrong light! It's off the starboard! Full to starboard! All guns... Full to stern starboard! Fire, rapid. Stand by to ram. Get all the wounded off as soon as the commandos are ashore. Aye aye, sir. Set all fuses for 0300. All fuses set for 0300, sir. Very good. Pilot. Sir? Embark all wounded in MLs astern. Aye aye, sir. Number 1? Sir? Check below decks and abandon ship as soon as wounded are clear. Aye aye, sir. Lower decks cleared, sir. Very good, number 1. Better get ashore. Aye aye, sir. There's the skipper. Glad you made it sir. We got all the badly wounded off the ML sir but I'm afraid she was the last one. The rest were sunk. Where's the doctor? - I'm afraid he was killed sir. - Thank you for the report. She should have gone off by now, shouldn't she sir? Why doesn't she go up sir? I don't know Daniel. She can't let us down now. Lieutenant Commander Fraser, the raid has been a failure. And we have destroyed all your ships and killed or captured nearly all your men. In a day or two, we will have removed your old destroyer from the dock gates, and you will have achieved precisely nothing. What was your object? Why'd you lose so many men and ships for nothing? Why? Why? Move it! Hey, Geneva Convention Article 163... treatment of prisoners of war. You can't do a thing like that to a man in uniform. You ought to know that. Come on, let's go.
