Hmm. Finally, I can go back now. Come on, Lucas. It's getting late. Ah. Ah. Lucas, hurry up. Marshmallows are getting soggy. Milk's turning blue. Just kidding. / Sweet, Dad. My favorite breakfast. For a kid with a beast of an appetite. Hey, I was thinking. Most of the top parents out there are letting their kids go to Melanie's party tonight. Maybe you should join in. Well, I appreciate having a son that's considering me for a group like that, but the answer's still no. It's gonna be supersize. Come on. / That's what I'm afraid of. Can you be cool? This one time? / No, we've already talked. Man. This is gonna be the party of the year. I guess you'll just have to wait for an even bigger party when you're older. Dad... This is totally unfair. You're shutting me out of the party of the century. So, it's the century now, huh? That's great news. If it's that big, you'll be able to read about it in the paper. I'm almost 15. Didn't you go out and have fun when you were a kid? No, I was too busy learning about respecting my parents' decisions. And since when is 13 almost 15? Look, it's decided. I'm worried about you having an attack. You're not going out till you're good with that inhaler. I've never even had an attack. I've never seen you have one, either. That's great, but the doctor said we have to be careful, since they're hereditary. Didn't the doctor tell you to lose some weight, too? How's that going? / Oh, don't remind me. All right, tell you what. You stay out of trouble, and practice carrying around that inhaler, and you can go. / Yes. Wait. Thanks, Dad. Hey, Kavinsky. Hand over my experiment, or I'll kick your face in. Funny thing, last night, I was thinking about your experiment and how much trouble I'd be in, if I didn't finish on time. I got stressed out, started breathing heavy, my stomach hurts, and I won't even get into how bad my headache was, but then I took some aspirin, and I was fine. I forgot. What? You forgot? Give me a good reason not to end you right now. Because one day I'll likely be your boss? What did you say? / Hey, tough guy. Why don't you mess with someone your own size? I'm not your own size. I'm not your own size. You know, I'm disappointed in both of you. I don't think you two realize how this works. Maybe if I pounded this through your thick skulls. Hey. Threat received. Everyone see how buff this guy is? We wouldn't stand a chance. How about we guarantee you an A-plus if you just chill out with the oppressive tyranny? What? / Cam. Drop the dorks and walk me to class. Okay, I'm gonna be expecting that A-plus. Or else it's the end of the road for both of you. Bye, boys. Look at her. Just walking away, like the world owes her a favor. I'd love to do favors for her. Are you going to her party? Are you kidding me? We have bigger issues to deal with here. You guys okay? / Of course. We're pros. Pros like us handle life as it comes. I was scared out of my mind. He's such a bully. You coming? We'll have to catch you later. We have to take care of something first. Great. See you around. We're so screwed. We've got an hour to save ourselves from un-elective surgery. Please tell me you have something. I have a potato. We're dead. A marker. A papier-mâché volcano. A frog. Well, a dead frog. How will that help us? I don't know. / I have an idea. Come on. Uh, should I bring the frog? Whoa! Okay, so, I got this frog here, and, uh... Okay. So, the frog has been dead since, um... Well, when it stopped living. But with the aid of a small electrical charge... I can bring its leg back to life. Okay, here we go. I'm turning the dial. If this doesn't work, it won't just be the frog that's dead. Oh, Cameron, I think we both know your grade. Whoa! / Oh, wow, I stand corrected, and I am pleasantly surprised. ♪ Bang, bang, into the room I know you want it ♪ ♪ Bang, bang, all over you ♪ ♪ Yo, I said, bang, bang Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ ♪ Bang, bang, bang Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ ♪ Bang, bang, there goes your heart I know you want it ♪ Stop. Please, stop now. What's going on? / Okay, that's the end. Just like a hot-air balloon. Ew. Disgusting. This couldn't have gone worse. And there it did. Frunk! You're dead. / Hmm. Ah. Frunk Mechanics. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. I see. All right. Thanks. Boss. / Yeah, one minute. This is very delicate. Hey, your son's in trouble at school, boss. Why can't he be simple, like this piece here? I swear, he's gonna kill me. Honey, what happened? You're so slimy. Ooh, are you all right? Well, I kind of did get scratched. What can Mummy do to make you feel better? Well, the new console might ease the pain, but with the new racing game, too. That would be great. / Oh, yes. Whatever my sweetest cutie pie wants... Mummy will do for you. I love you so much. Nothing's gonna hurt my baby. Well, looks like that party of the century won't be happening for you in the next 100 years. / What? It wasn't my fault. It was the system's fault. Not the "system" system, but the electrical system. / See you. Have a great weekend. Why am I in trouble? I was actually a hero, in a sense. Well, until the frog exploded. Peter's mom thinks he's ready for parties, and that guy carries dead frogs around. If my mom was here, she'd be so upset at Dad for how he treats me. Even Cameron gets hugged on the way to a mini-van. Oh, and he gets Melanie? You know what? Whatever. They'll see. Hey, there you are, you lazy lizard. Shoo. Dad, I'm calling you with an exciting opportunity. What can I do for you to allow me to go to that party tonight? Can I interest you in dishwashing, or a car detail package? I'd be willing to study the art of shiatsu to improve your poor circulation. Nice try, Lucas, but you're still grounded. How about we cook something nice and I let you rent a movie tonight? It'll be fun. A mom would've appreciated that massage. Please. No. Leave it alone. It kidnapped your wife. I know, I want to buy him a drink. I knew you'd come if I texted you. Hashtag "what took you so long"? Hi, Melanie. I like your chicken costume. I'm an angel. Oh. Uh, of course. Whatever. I liked your moves you pulled in class today. Wanna see mine? Mm-hm. To my Chihuahua, to my Ranchito. To my Luis Manuel Daniel. I don't know what I would do without you. You're crazy. I know you're pregnant. How do you know? I found the pregnancy test. Where are you, son? Time for your medicine. Lucas? / Yes? I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes. That's what you get, nerd. Hi. / Run! Run for your lives! I should've kept myself grounded. Dad? / You were supposed to stay in the house. Lucas. Up here, Dad. Hang on tight, son. Huh? Run, you fools. Hey, where are y'all going? What happened here? Oh, nice costume, kid. / Um, thanks. I told you to stay in the house. You never listen. Seriously, Dad? I turn into a hideous monster, and you say that? Open your mouth. Ah. / Almost there. Oh, I think we should've brought you down first. What are you trying to do? Blind me? And choke me, too? / Sorry, son. Try to calm down. I'll explain later. / Explain? What's going on? Take me to a hospital. You don't need a hospital. You're gonna be okay. What's going on? Just get dressed and try to calm down. Are you kidding? That was no attack. I just turned giant and orange. Well... there's a simple explanation for that. The truth is we're monsters. Wait, what? You're screwing with me. Don't talk like that. Besides, it's true. Our whole family. When we turn into teenagers, we also turn into monsters. But I don't wanna be a monster. I know, it's confusing. It felt strange my first time, too, and I knew beforehand. Then why didn't you tell me? Do you know how embarrassing it is to randomly monster out in front of your whole class? I can't go back there. You ruined my life. I'm sorry. You wouldn't have believed me until it happened. And I hope the inhaler meant it never would. If you take it every 24 hours, you'll get to stay normal. Hmm? That's the good news? That I have to take weird concoctions you make in an auto shop? What did Mom think about this? Or did you keep her in the dark about that, too? She didn't know. The woman in that picture is just a model. Your real mother was a monster, too. I lost her back on the island. This isn't even her? Then what happened to her? / I'll tell you when you're ready. When I'm ready? How could you lie about my own mother? I wanted to protect you. I don't even know who my mother is. I don't even know what I am. Oh, come on, kiddo. It's not that bad. This is from our island, Calvera. Your Grandma Carlotta and the others are still there. I've never even seen that on any map. That's because it moves around. This is a carta. It acts like a... A GPS. And it's the only way back. Well, let's go, then. What are we waiting for? I'll take you when you're ready. I promise. Some promise. You'll never say I'm ready. You never do. Enough. Try to get some sleep. We can talk more in the morning. Hey, buddy. You feeling any better? Not again. Oh, this is nuts. How am I supposed to find him? Hey, kid. This is a restricted area. And Sprinkles here doesn't like trespassers. Oh, yeah? I'm sure he's going to change his mind when he tastes... this. Fetch. Ooh, yum! Stop it. Hey, get off the boat. Just where do you think you're going? Bring it back. You want some? It's really good. I don't understand. There is nothing here. Oh, no. My dad is going to kill me... if they find my dead body. Oh, it's just a seagull. If there are seagulls, that means there must be land nearby. What's that noise? Don't worry, little guy. I'm not going to hurt you. Sorry. Ah. Calm down, Lucas. Don't freak out. Nothing to be afraid of. Here, froggy, froggy. Whoa! I didn't want to have to resort to this, but... Durgo... Mongo... haven't I told you not to play with your food? Just kidding. I'm gonna tear your gills off. Bring him. Whoa! Om... A new traveler arrives. Indeed, I sense a powerful need for enlightenment. Open the door. You open it. / I opened it last time. Fine. I open, but you hold my incense. A human. Impossible. / Open the door. Please. I need help. Come on, guys. I need a carta. / But... we both felt a monster. Why does he have a blue lizard? Please, I'm from Calvera. The card said you'd help. Brace the door. We can't let another one in. Relax. Take a minute to feel. He's different. Om... Well, maybe he feels a little different. But the last human stole our carta. Then this one cannot, because it is gone. Hmm. I never thought of it that way. You know, sometimes talking to you is like finding the missing half of myself. So, we open? Yes, we open. Remember to charge this time. Psst, psst. Oh, thank you, thank you. Whoa, whoa. Hold it right there. Why do you smell like a monster, but look like a human? Oh, because I am one, and I need a carta to find my son. I'm willing to pay a good price for it. Sorry, dude. Somebody stole it. What? Oh, gosh, that darn kid. Come on, at least give me some direction. As Calvera is always moving, there are no directions we can give you. It's like giving you directions to a cloud or a flying bird, dude. My money is leaving. I mean, our brother is leaving. But there's a way. Any monster who has been to Calvera can feel his way back. Oh. I can do that. I'll just stop using this, and I'll be a monster again. Here it comes. Don't worry. You'll get your turn. We were already stocked, I'd have taken care of you by now. But unfortunately, we're in a bit of a transition. Excuse me, boss, this box says "kitchenware", but it's mostly bath towels. Should I still bring it to the kitchen? No, you dolt. Obviously, the bathroom. Doesn't seem obvious. Box says "kitchenware". I think we need to tune the machine a little. Bring me another one. Hey. Whoa, whoa, easy, little buddy. Calvera? Sorry. Patrick. Oh! Don't speak to strangers. Wait. Wow, this is amazing. Hey. Didn't your mom tell you to watch both ways before you cross the street? Sorry. Kids. Hey, wait. I heard Frank hasn't appeared yet. Can't trust anyone nowadays. Good afternoon. Oh. Okay. / Oh, as if. I can't believe we have one more missing. Um, excuse me, officers. / To the left. Do you know where Carlotta's shop is? / No, right. Next block. Hmm, this is weird. I've never seen this citizen before. Yeah, he's got some funny-looking pants. Heh. He's got pockets on the legs. I could use those. Hmm. Very fishy. Huh? But I put on deodorant today. I'm not talking about you. A foreigner arrives, and kidnappings happening at the same time. Ooh. What a cute little boy. / Yeah, no problem. Hi, Carlotta. Got my order? / Same as always. Coming right up. Thanks, Carlotta. Oh, always happy to help. Bye now. Hello there. How can I help you? Carlotta? / Yes? You're not going to believe this, but I'm... / Hey. Look out. / Whoa, sorry. You sure like stopping the flow of traffic, kid. You may not be a monster yet, but you're taking up just as much space. Ah, Veronica. Don't worry. There are kids that monsterize when they're 16 and they're even bigger than the rest. Can we speak in private, please? How about you finish up here, dear? Huh? Wha...? That's about enough. Thanks, Gary. You're welcome, Carlotta. Nice evening. Frog tea? It's fresh. Oh, no, thanks. Uh, frogs are just sort of bad luck for me. So... / I'm Lucas. Your grandson. What are you doing here? Well... I'm not even really sure how it happened. I'm so happy to see you. Where's your dad? Um, I don't think you're going to like this, but to tell you the truth, uh, my dad... he's such a monster. No offense. He's been lying to me. My God, this is even better than Monsters of Our Lives. He's good. Don't you see this is a scam? He's fiddling with us like a clarinet. Give me those. / Hey. I wanna listen. I can't believe my dad kept all this from me. You, this place, even the truth about my real mom. Oh, honey, come on. Don't be so hard on him. I'm sure he was just trying to protect you. Well, so much for that plan. Can you tell me more about my mom? Oh, someone's knocking. Yes, I'll get that. Good night, Carlotta. I don't know if they already told you, but tomorrow we're having a meeting. It's really disturbing what's happening, with all these disappearances. It's kind of late. Why don't you go upstairs to your room? It's the one on the right. I'll be up there in a moment. We might not have anything yet, but they always make mistakes. And that's when the long arm of the law reaches out to catch them. Should I call Deputy Octopusinski? His arms are the longest. Idiot. Come on, man. We've been here all day long. Wait a minute. You'll see. Hmm. How long have you been using this? Uh... Thirteen years. Hmm. Ah, dude. This is not going to happen. Ah! We will have to do it our own way, then. Sorry, it was in shuffle. Come in. I wouldn't want my grandson getting the chills. Is this my mom? / Yes, honey. Could you tell me what happened to her? It's kind of a long story. Why don't we talk about it tomorrow? Good night, sweetheart. / Good night. Oh, no. Whoa. Oh. Whoa! Lucas, breakfast. Good morning. / How was your night, sweetheart? Kind of odd. I heard the strangest sound. And I think screaming. Oh, that's not good. Lately there has been some trouble in town. You should be careful, honey. Now, eat up. / Thanks, Carlotta. Oh, call me Grandma, for Pete's sake. / Ugh. I haven't been waiting all these years for you to come back and call me Carlotta. Thanks, Grandma. Hey, Carlotta. What's he doing here? Well, he's my grandson. Hmm. The two of you are going to run the store together while I go to the town hall meeting. What? Now, don't you worry. It shouldn't be busy. This will be a nice chance for the two of you to get along. Eat up quick. Doors open in 20 minutes. Nine-twenty, Carlotta leaves the house. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Carlotta. Take it easy. This is no picnic. Mm, picnic. Is that a picture of your girlfriend from back home? Hey. / Is she cute? It's not my girlfriend, and it's not your business. Wait. / Give me that. You're not one of those love-letter writers, are you? Stop. Carlotta told me about her. That's your mom, isn't it? Just give it back. I'm sorry. She was beautiful. I know it's hard. I lost my parents, too. But at least you have a grandma. / Well, I guess. Do you know how she died? What monsters say is that her brother, your uncle, was a scientist. And he went nuts, and there was an explosion. And, um... Well, you know. That can't be true. Look, no one's coming into the store with that meeting going on. Let's get you out of here. Hey, don't pull me. Come on. Hey. / Back up. Officer Giraldo here. Requesting backup. Officers under... What are we under, boss? Back up the car, you moron. Ah! Oh, I get it. Uh, never mind. I'm pretty sure we can handle the backing up ourselves. Brake. Oops! Storm! Give this fallen monster... life! Chill out, bro. Let's see. Uh, guys? I, uh... I feel like this is more likely to make me not alive. Ah. Well, I don't feel the island... but I do feel like I need an aspirin. I can't see. I can't see, I can't see. Come on, try it. Mm. Whoa! ♪ Ooh, she gives me love and affection ♪ ♪ Baby, did I mention ♪ ♪ You're the only girl for me ♪ ♪ No, I don't need a next one ♪ ♪ Mama loves you, too ♪ ♪ She thinks I made the right selection ♪ ♪ Now all that's left to do Is just for me to pop the question ♪ ♪ Oh, I think that I found myself A cheerleader ♪ ♪ She is always right there When I need her ♪ ♪ Oh, I think that I found myself A cheerleader ♪ ♪ She is always right there When I need her ♪ What? Hey, I'm coming. Hurry. My antennae are out for whoever's responsible. And we've already come up with a few crumbs of information. Come on, I said, crumbs. No more crumbs. We want answers. Well, that's precisely why Deputies Fergus and Giraldo are here to answer all of your questions. Let's give a big round of applesauce to Calvera's very own peacekeepers. Yeah, that's right. Bravo. Bravo. Great performance, begging for your life. Please, no! Durgo! / Yes, sir. We're going to go shopping. Let's say hi to the family. At 9:02 we went to Clara's Café to get some coffee. And doughnuts. / And doughnuts. At 9:03 I scratched my head. Did you get rid of that itch, boss? Oh, are you kidding me? / Terrible. Come on. They captured the mayor's assistant. At 9:03, I scratched my head. / Oh, gosh. We're all going to die! We're gonna die! Today was pretty cool. What was that? / Those are Rock Turtles. Ah, Rock Turtles. I think I've met one of them. And what's that castle there? / Um... that's where the accident happened. Then I need to go. It's getting dark. Carlotta's gonna kill me. We should go. Oh, where's your sense of adventure all of a sudden? I'm all adventure. I'm just, you know, trying not to get us kidnapped. Seriously, let's go. Veronica? Lucas? Where are you kids? Oh, I don't like this. Lucas, is that you? Who are you? What are you doing here? Carlotta, calm down. You don't recognize your own son anymore? Norcutt. Norcutt's mother? It's a pleasure. You raised such an evil son. Just shoot her already. But, sir, she's your mother. Give me that. Want me to go in with you? She wouldn't yell at her grandson. Scoot safe, okay? Sure, kid. Night. Relaxing evening, huh? Fine, I'm in. Jump on. Since ancient times, monsters have been pursued by dogs. I don't think I like where this is going. If you want to bring back your inner monster, you have to feel his pain. The way is the way. You're... Aw... Come on, you're not gonna... Feel the monster, Nicolas. Feel it. This isn't working out, bro. We have to take more drastic measures. No... no... no... No, no, no... Whoa! Come on. / Are you sure? If this place is abandoned, why are the lights on? This was your idea in the first place, genius. Mm, mm! You haven't lost your touch. How could you do this to me, your own mother? Well, I came back to thank you. I was trying to be like you, have your powers. But then I thought, why limit myself to just a few when I can have them all? So, I did a few half-baked experiments. Uh-oh. As you can see, they didn't work out that well. So, Mom, this is what happens when you turn your back on your son. Now I'm here to finish what you didn't let me finish before. Not even what you did to Dina stopped you. You did what to my mom? Lucas. Lucas? So nice to see you, kid. Last time you were a tad shorter. You brought a special guest. This must be my lucky day. I told you we shouldn't have come. You're a murderer. Well, that's a huge accusation, kid. I take it no one told him, right? What happened that night? That night. Ah, that flatworm stew smells amazing. I hope it tastes all right. I tried adding cumin this time. Before long, this little guy will be at the table, too. We're calling him Lucas in honor of Dad. If he were still here, he'd be thrilled. Look at the feet. This guy's gonna grow up to be a monster. Oh, he's squeezing so tight. Looks like someone already loves his grandma. / Oh, come on. Oh, great, by the time he's a teenager, he'll be throwing his tiny human uncle around like a toy. Oh, stop that. We'll keep you safe, if necessary. I don't want to be kept safe. He's going to grow up with amazing powers, and I'll just be his weird uncle who never transformed. I'll be in my lab. I'm sorry to have ruined such a nice evening. Why do I even bother? Why can't he just get over it? It's easy for you. You transformed. Well, he should have accepted it by now. Let me talk to him. Inert, but interesting. What if I titrate in a bit of thionyl chloride? I know you hate not being a monster, but you can't torture yourself trying to transform. I can try, and with any luck, that baby of yours won't grow up to see me as his weak, boring uncle. He'll love you for how you are, not how you look. You shouldn't be mixing that. It's dangerous. I'll get it this time. You'll see. Oh, no. It's too reactive. Watch out. Oh! What was that? / Dina. Where is she? Where is she?! She's inside. I... I couldn't help her. Wait, no. What did you do? I was so close. But the solution went exothermic. I must have over-poured when she came in. She saved me. And you didn't do anything?! Look what you've done, all because of your obsession. You no longer have a place here. Leave the island... and never come back again. Leave the island, before I regret not finishing this. Mom? I'm sorry. I just wanted to turn into a monster. No. Please, no. That was an accident. But this is not. Get them. This way. Leave her alone. Not my eyes. On second thought... Get them. The window. Run, Lucas! Find... him. Maybe you were right. I wasn't ready. Whoa. This isn't right. The stake is way too small. Stop. This isn't what being a monster is all about. So, what is it all about? Being a monster is about... He looks like you. Oh, he loves his daddy. It's about doing what it takes to be a family. Go, then. Are you laughing at me? Didn't you tell me only monsters could go back? Well, my friend, you are a monster. Thank you for saying that. Look at yourself. You are a monster. What? We did it. I'm a monster again. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Come on, Watson. Feel the island, Nicolas. Feel it. / Goodbye. You did charge him, right? I thought it was your turn. / No, I did... No, you did not... / You always forget to do it. I do everything. What is wrong with you? / Leave me alone. I'm the boss. Carlotta, are you okay? You won't get away with this. Your secret's out. Lucas is going to tell the whole town. Now shut up. I didn't capture you for the power of your voice. What is that? A present? I didn't expect this. But I guess this will work. Where's the boy? Hope he tasted good. / Lucas? Now we are hot on the trail of the kidnapper, but he's dangerous, he's cunning, merciless, has an intimate understanding of the island, and razor-sharp teeth, and fiery blue hair, unlike anything you've ever seen. He's cunning, he's capable, he's everywhere, and he's nowhere. He's here! Don't worry. This is my job. Please, my grandma and Veronica have been kidnapped. Uh, that's the nice kid we've been following around, boss. They're in the castle. Sounds like another attempt at an alibi. / What are you talking about? Ever since you've come to town, people have been disappearing. You don't think he's magic, do you, boss? No, I don't think he's magic. I think he's under arrest. Wait, no. What are you doing? Wait, wait. You're coming with me. Come on. Norcutt has the hostages. They're all in the castle. Wait. / Come on, let's go. Hmm. What happened here? Lucas? Carlotta? How about that sushi place? No, nobody ever goes there anymore. It's too crowded. Tonight is not your night. I am still the champion. Hat, please. Excuse me. / How can I help you, sir? I'm looking for my son and his grandma. I went to her store, but it was raided. What on earth happened? Where is Carlotta? Or have you seen a small, blue-haired kid, about this big? The dad. Dad? Is that you? Hey, you. Nice to see you, too. Did you miss me? Son. / Not so fast. What were you thinking? / You lied to me my whole life? You kept away from my grandmother. / You are an irresponsible child. What dad lies to his son about his mom? / It was to protect you. Protect me? From who? / What did I do? From my own family? / How could my son be so reckless? You are so grounded, kid. / Dad, please. I am going to... Just... Just don't say anything. I don't understand. Officer, can you tell me what exactly is going on here? After all these years, I'm almost there. Bring her. Get off me. Let me go. Son, please. I raised you better than this. Then at 10:20, we finished our doughnuts. I know it may sound like a lot of time to finish doughnuts, but you know how difficult they are to digest. And I can't go on the job without finishing business first. Then we saw a stranger, walking on the street. Do you have any idea how weird that is? Then at 11:20... Lucas, are you okay? See you, guys. Oh, whoa! Come on, Watson. Oh, whoa! Ready, sir. Looks like we're all set. How does it feel to be a part of history? Huh? Durgo, Mongo, see what's going on. Norcutt? Norcutt, come on and face me. Hey, you. I don't know who you are, but you picked the wrong place to come barging in like that. / Oh, don't worry, I'll make sure you remember me this time. You look like a reasonable guy. Why don't we talk about it? You no longer have a place here. Leave the island. I gotta hand it to you, kid. I'm gonna remember you now. Dad. / Are you kidding me? This is the third time that you ran away this week. I had no choice. / Yeah, sure. I bet it has nothing to do with how stubborn you are. I got it from your side of the family. You have no idea of how hard it is to raise you on my own. Well, you don't have an idea how hard is to live on a lie. Huh? I need you to find a safer place and wait for me. But they have Grandma in the basement. Lucas. Uh-oh. Scary. Son. Go and get your grandma. Quick. What took you so long? Grandma, are you okay? Please, help us. Let us out. Don't worry about us. Help Veronica. I'll get you out of here... / Actually... I think everyone will be staying. No! / Who are you? Oh! Look who's all grown up. Are you missing some of your precious formula? No. No... / Let her go and I'll give it back. All right. Veronica, are you, okay? Yes. No! What have you done?! What have you done?! Lucas. / Nicolas. Come on. Let's get out of here. A family reunion. Wow, how beautiful. I always wanted to be a true part of this family after all. Norcutt? What are you doing here? Oh, I'm back. And what are you gonna do about it? Get them out of here. I won't let you hurt my family again. Then just consider them dead. Help! Help us! You gotta get us out of here. This brings back memories. Stop this madness. Look what you've done! Oh, sure, let's talk. Have it your way, then. Ooh! Huh? Oh, I didn't know we could do that. Grandma, take shelter. Don't go, Lucas. It's too dangerous. Best monster ever. Is that all you've got, champ? Lucas... / Lucas, are you hurt? No, Grandma, but where's my dad? Dad? Dad. Dad. Wake up. Come on, Dad. I promise, I'll never run away again. Dad?
