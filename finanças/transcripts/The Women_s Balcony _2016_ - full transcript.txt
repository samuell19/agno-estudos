United King Films present A Pie Films production A film by Shlomit Nehama & Emil Ben Shimon THE WOMEN'S BALCONY Hold it straight. Go on... go on... Congratulations! Good Sabbath Rabbi. Good Sabbath, Rahamim, Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath, Rabbi. - Good Sabbath, dear Nissan. Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath, Rabbi Aaron. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath, sir. Good Sabbath, sir. Congratulations, Grandpa Zion. Thank you, sir. Zion, my dear, what about the window? When will its time come? - I know. I've been so busy with the Bar Mitzvah. One mustn't delay repairing the House of the Lord. Too true, too true. Congratulations, Ettie. May he bring you only pride and joy. Thank you, Geoula. How are you, Geoula? - Very well. Are you sure? - Thank God. This is a very important day for Ettie. No trouble, okay? Don't worry, it'll be fine. We trust you, Geoula. Yeah, sure we do. Take all the liquor off the tables, we'll put it back after the prayers. Can't you leave the compote alone?! I woke up starving. Ettie, it's delicious. Enjoy, darling. If there's any left, put it in the fridge. You mustn't touch that on Sabbath! It's forbidden! Oh, honey, did I scare you? It's all right, sweetie. Want some compote? It's sweet. No? All right. You turned it off. Now how will we make tea? Want to turn it on one last time? One last time? Just flick the switch. All right. Go to your mother, honey. Oh, Margalit, why did you make eggplant? I said I would. Nissan brought me a crate. What was I supposed to do with it? Never mind. Damn it, yours is better. Good Sabbath, Rabbanit (Rabbi's wife). Have a seat. Gladly. Good Sabbath, Rabbanit. The candy. Where is it? - You have it. I do? Oh no! Yaffa, I can't trust you with anything! How could I forget such a thing? - Don't make a scene. Do you have your keys? I'll get the candy. - Are you crazy? Send Rachel, she runs fast. Aaron Babayof is honored with the reading of the first passage. You're probably asking yourselves what became of him. Well? He moved to the land of Israel. That's it for today's sermon. But that reminds me of a story, a very nice story, very nice, about... a merchant who used to pray before he opened his shop. But what did his wife do? Well? She went. Where did she go? Where did she go? I'll tell you at the meal. And now I call up the Bar Mitzvah boy, Osher Yazdi. Ettie! Ettie! Where are they? I'll be late for Zion. Stop that. It won't do her any good. Stay away if that's how you're gonna be. I can't stop thinking that it should be me lying here. Why did I get up? - Stop it, honey. We each have our own fate. Look how puffy your eyes are. How'll you go on a date like that? I'm calling it off. It's not the day for it. With you, it's never the day. How'll you ever find a man? Besides, Margalit will kill you if you cancel it. Have some, sweetie. It's good for you. What about Yisa Bracha? It's a big synagogue and it's hardly half-full. It's too far to go every morning, we won't make it. What about the Nash Didan synagogue, Ahavat Zion? They're at each other's throats and you'll get stuck in the middle. Nissan? - What? - You have customers. She'll never buy anything. What do you have to lose? See? I told you. Zion, help me out here. No synagogue is good enough for them. They offered us a classroom at Ohr Sameach. We can use it in the meantime. I'm just afraid we won't have a Minyan (quorum of ten). They'll come. Trust me. I'll wake them up one by one. Come on, already. - I'm here. It's just wrong. Hello. Where've you been? Ask Dopey here. I waited an hour for her. How are you, Yaffa? I hear you have a big event tonight. She doesn't want to go. Are you crazy? Margalit will kill you. - I told her that. That's a pity, she says you hit the jackpot. Educated, upstanding... You have to go. You'll regret it. Any news, Ettie? Was the Rabbi here? - No. Poor thing. I'll tell Zion to try to talk to him again. What is that, a monster? A cyclops? What's so funny? Is that me? Am I really that fat? Where is the boy who drew me? Trust me. It's best this way. Come, let's load the truck with the synagogue gear and move it there. Now? Now that the sun finally came out? Sit down. Okay, get up. The First Lady is here. Come, Mom must be home by now. - Hello. - Hi. Hi, Ettie. - How are you? You'll spend some time with her, okay? Oh, hello, Avram Yitzhak! How are you, sweetie? Ah... - Hey, honey. Hi, honey. - How's it going? It's all good. What did you bring today? Your favorite, honey. - How's the Rabbanit? Who's your favorite biblical hero? Hero... Samson? Interesting. Why Samson? I don't know, he was... a hero. Here I disagree. I prefer King David. Oh, kings count, too? Then King David, of course. Very good. Next question. Which of the 13 Divine Attributes describes you best? Pass. Good evening, Rabbi. Sir, Ettie spoke to the doctors today. They said that the Rabbanit's condition has been stable for a few days. That's a good sign. If you'd like, I can come by tomorrow morning and take you to see her. Something to drink, Zion, my son? Bat-Sheva? Can you make a cup of tea for our Zion, Bat-Sheva? Bat-Sheva? It's all right, Rabbi, I can't drink hot drinks at night. Thank you. Have it your way, son. Mr. Zion, Mr. Zion. The Rabbi isn't well, Mr. Zion. This is not the first time. He keeps talking to his wife. I tell him: Your wife isn't here. She's in the hospital. - Don't tell him that. Never contradict the Rabbi. I don't understand. - Never tell the Rabbi he's wrong. What the Rabbi says, we say "amen." He's a very big man, okay? - I know he's a big man, I know but even a big man needs help. We have to take him to a shrink... - Shh! No shrink! We'll find a solution. No shrink. Morning prayer, my good man? - I already prayed. Prayers, rabbi? I'm sorry... -Oh, here's our wake-up caller. Good morning, Roni. I don't know why I didn't wake up. How many men are there? Almost half, counting you. - Oh, no. Get to work. Deserted. Where'll he find anyone? Let's just pray individually. Give him a few more minutes. Excuse me, will you join our prayers? Sure. Gladly, it's a great privilege. - Bless you. - How many are you? Only you four? More are coming. If you don't mind, I'll be right back. - Sure. We'll be right here. If he comes back, I'm a donkey. We're wasting our time. Let's pray individually. Turn around, you donkey. Excuse me. I just wanted to thank you. Bless you, you're like an angel from Heaven. - Praise the Lord. What did you do to deserve this? This? It was much worse before. The thing is... our synagogue collapsed. Oh, you're from the synagogue that was destroyed. Mussayof. Yes. - What a tragedy. When, God willing, will it be fixed? It'll take a long time. There's a lot of damage and a lot of factors involved. Inspections, permits. And leave a Jerusalem synagogue in that state? Disgraceful. Tell your rabbi to put the pressure on or nothing will happen. Our rabbi... hasn't been well since the incident. May God heal him. - Amen. - Amen. That was a terrible blow for you. You know, the best remedy for the soul is bible study. If you're interested, I teach at my seminary across the way. I'd love to see you there. Thank you. - All the best. - Thank you, Rabbi. Honored friends, I'm sure you've heard of the tragedy that struck the Mussayof congregation. To see that house of prayer in that state, the heart breaks and the mind cannot comprehend it. How could such evil befall the House of the Lord? And during services, no less. The ark was open and the bible scroll that laid out in all its splendor was destroyed. What can I tell you? Heaven help us. But here's the amazing thing. Who were the greatest victims? The rabbi of the congregation, his wife the Rabbanit, may they both be healed, and the custodian, who, thank God, is here with us today. The public servants, folks, the public servants. They protected the congregation with their bodies. Such sacrifice for the Lord. Dear Aaron, may your deeds and pain be rewarded, with God's help and may your people repent before God and may He restore His holy house soon. Amen. - Amen. Here, sweetie. Put it in your bag. Too bad you weren't there. What a sermon Rabbi David gave. Very important. What did he talk about? Lots of things. - Did he? - Sure. About public servants, about the importance of the custodian. - Oh, nice. He said that the custodian should wake up and open the synagogue and make sure there are ten men, eh, Roni? You know nothing about the custodian's job. You simpletons, I wasn't even going to tell you, these things are too lofty for you. - Come here, sweetie. I'm talking to Zion. - We'll go for our walk, okay? Come along. - What's so funny? Don't stop, righteous men, serve God with joy! We have good news, thank God. Come here, Ettie. So say it's good news. Do you know what I was thinking? Good news, darling, good news. Well? Speak up already. Cheers! They're starting to renovate your synagogue tomorrow. What? How? What about all the permits and inspections? That rabbi I told you about took care of everything. He's an angel, a magician. He says it'll be ready by Purim. We'll have our synagogue back? - Now drink. Cheers! Ah! Honey, you've made me so happy. I never thought it would happen. Of course it would. Oy! What happened? The circuit breaker again? You have to fix it, Zion. - I'll fix everything, darling. May God bless you and send you salvation. - Thank you. Come in, grab a seat. Oh, welcome. Greetings. What an honor. Hello, Rabbi. - How are you all? How are you, Zion? Rabbi, we want to thank you for everything you've done for us. You can't imagine how happy you've made us. Thank the Creator, I'm just His messenger. God willing we'll restore its former glory. - God willing. - Amen. Say, Zion, I understand you're close to your rabbi. How is he? It's taking time. God bless him. I don't mean to pry, but the renovations have to be supervised by a rabbi. I was thinking, only if you want me to, I'd be glad to do it in his place. After all he's been through he deserves to come back to a synagogue in all its glory. Think about it and get back to me. Women are exempt from scripture studies. Exempt. Men - "And you shall meditate on it day and night." Women are exempt. How can that be? Where's the equality? No fair. Poor woman, she has to take care of the kids, the home, this and that. But what about us? Don't we work hard? Don't we have our worries? Furthermore, so the sages say, the woman is analogous to the scriptures . Meaning woman equals holy scripture. So it isn't from lack of time that women are exempt, it's because they don't need it. The scriptures dwell within them, it's built in. Do you realize how superior to us women are? Even if we study every day, maybe we'll reach the level of a woman who's never studied a verse in her life. Now I ask you, gentlemen, if a woman has such great light, how should she protect it? Just as we cover, wrap, conceal the bible scroll, so should a woman protect the holiness within her, with modesty. And that's important for you, too. "All of a man's blessings come from his wife's covered hair," say the Kabbalists. Not just one, not two, not three, but all blessings, and the blessing of livelihood above all. See how important a woman's head-covering is? But what does that have to do with me? If my wife doesn't want to be modest, is it my responsibility? Yes it is, gentlemen. Just as we receive the reward, we must be responsible for her. Not by force, God forbid, through kindness, love and generosity. Go home today with a little gift for your wife, why not? Spoil her. You'll see the light in her eyes. Damn, it stopped working again... Ora, how are you? What's new, Ora? What could be new? What's that? I brought you a present. - A present? Is today a holiday? Can't a man make his wife happy? That's new. Well, why not? Thank you. You're welcome. Well, let's have it. Finish ironing first. I'm finished. What is this? A head scarf, what else? What do I need a scarf for? For modesty. Ever heard of modesty? Are you serious? What's wrong with it? You know what a blessing it is? It can help my income. Nissan, try working. That'll really help your income. Take it back. I have a closetful if I feel like being ultra orthodox. Just try it, Margalit. Wear it for a few days. Why not? See how beautiful you look. What's with you? Be a Hasidic rabbi if you want to. What do you want from me? I want you to cover your hair. - Is that so? Don't you realize that a woman is like a bible scroll? You have to protect yourself. I'm a bible scroll? You should've brought me an ark to sit in. Go ahead, make fun. What's the big deal? It's a pretty, modest thing. Why not? Stop it! It's so pretty. You have such good taste. That's why I married you. I'll save it for Purim, for the reopening of the synagogue. Happy Purim, Rabbi. The renovation is finally finished. Tonight, God willing, we'll read the Book of Esther. Wonderful. Let's go home, sweetheart. Don't you want to go in? And see the synagogue from inside? What synagogue? - Ours. Mussayof. Mussayof is destroyed, son. Destroyed. It isn't destroyed, sir. Come in and see for yourself. It's destroyed, destroyed. Let's go. - But it isn't destroyed, Rabbi. What the big man say, we say "amen." Is everything ready, Zion? More or less. - I'm so excited. Relax, it isn't finished yet. It's only temporary. Then I'm temporarily excited. I'll get over it. Why didn't you take an umbrella? Don't worry about it. - You're all wet. It's just a little water. Go inside, I turned on the hot water. Take a hot shower, okay? Are you coming back? - No, I'm going with girls. Meet you at the synagogue. I wanted to talk to you. - Hurry, Ettie. Margalit will kill us. We'll talk tonight. Okay, honey? Take a nice hot shower. - All right. What happened to the women's section? What is this? Excuse me. You call this a women's section? - They did it all themselves. She left, Uncle. The cowards, they didn't say a word. We knew nothing about it. I'm furious. Shh, show some respect. And making your wives sit in this outhouse is respectful? You're not ashamed of that, are you? - Who are they, anyway? What are they doing here? - Shh... Protecting you? - Shh. Enough. Happy Purim. How are you? Why the long face? I told you, I won't rest until you have a new bible scroll. Thank you, Rabbi, but that's not it. We have a problem. You'd better get a grip. We don't understand? You don't understand! You couldn't have warned me? Wait up, Ettie. Ettie. Ettie, wait . You brought good news that day. We danced, we drank a toast. What did we toast, Zion? Believe me, Ettie, I didn't know. I didn't know. We only realized we didn't have enough money once we started planning. What could we do? It was that or nothing. - Better nothing. Who wants a synagogue like that? What kind of synagogue is that? Well? Don't you want us there? Did you renovate for your own sake? For Rabbi Menashe's sake, Ettie. Only for his sake. In his condition, I wanted him to see the synagogue standing. To give him a reason to wake up and go out. I thought... it'd help him recover. And did it help? He refused to even go in and look. You should've told me. Since when do you hide things from me? It was our mistake not to look into it. What? Who says it's your sole responsibility? Not once did a woman go in and see what they were doing. But that's it. It's all over. We'll invite everyone over and talk and see how we can raise the money. We'll work it out. Did you ever think that you might have a part in the evil that befell you? Perhaps you don't deserve that lofty place. Do a little soul-searching. Why did it happen? Where did we go wrong? How did we do evil in the eyes of God? He could've wiped you out with one blow. But no. The merciful Lord gave you a second chance. Embrace it. Make amends. Become stronger in the scriptures. Be modest. - He shouted and shouted. He was so brutal, don't ask. Ora! And you know the worst part? I felt paralyzed. There's something about him. I couldn't utter a word. Ora! What... What's going on, honey? What's the matter? Oh, Ettie. Too bad you left yesterday. It was earth shattering. I couldn't sleep all night from my thoughts. Look at her. You stay home, we'll shop for you. Get some sleep. Really, Ettie? - Sure, honey. Don't worry. Thanks. She took it hard. She's nothing. Wait till you see Tikva. Hey, Zion, how's it going? - Thank God. They're Alexander's. Especially for Ettie. Which do you like better, Avram Yitzhak? This one? Good. Now some oranges. Any bananas, Eli? What are you doing, Avram Yitzhak? Don't do that. Well? A lot of work to do. - How much will it cost? I'll prepare a quote for you. Cut the crap. How much? I could tell you how much, but I don't like to haggle. I'll give you the best price I can offer. Take it or leave it. Work comes from Heaven. I've got plenty of work. Sure. It'll come to about 90,000. What?! 60,000 for what? No, I said... - Why are you...? He said he won't haggle. He said 60,000 and that's that. - No, no... Sweetheart, I asked around. Your reputation precedes you. Kobi is in a different league from the guy who quoted us 45,000. He's number one. Oh. Then it's all right. We'll figure out how to raise the money. Cash! - Of course. Here he comes. Greetings. - Hello, hello. Welcome. - How are you? - Fine. Greetings. - How are you? Mind if I steal Nissan for a minute? Of course not. After you. New suit? Oh, yes. Shall I pull it Off? -Sure. Wear it well. - Thanks. Tea? -Uh... - Come in, have a seat. What were you thinking? All this water? - Too much? It's all right. I don't know if there's enough hokineh. Worse comes to worst, we'll make some on the spot. Ettie, I won't stay here tonight. Rabbi David ordered a lot of dishes from Nissan. A big order, for his whole seminary for Passover. And Nissan's afraid he won't approve of our fundraiser after what he said about the women's section. It's a lot of money, Ettie. You know our financial situation. - I know, dear. I swear, the second he gives Nissan the check nothing will stop me. Just give me until Passover, you'll see. Who can wait until Passover? I'm raising the whole 60,000 tonight. Do you want the chairs in a circle or in rows? Huh? Esther? Rows are better. All right. Since when do you call me Esther? Why not? Like Queen Esther. Some queen. They say the righteous protect those who are named after them. Is that so? Is that one of the new rabbi's pearls of wisdom? So what if it is? You've already judged him? Everything he says is wrong? - Give me a break, Zion. Exhuming the righteous to protect people... What a load of crap. Why do you even say such things? And you, poor thing, now I see why you have so many troubles. Because you don't have a righteous man protecting you. Thank God, I have a righteous woman protecting me! Huh? - Stop it, troublemaker! You solve everything like that. But one day it won't work any more. How can this be, Zion? When did we ever invite people over and they didn't come? They usually can't wait. How could Tikva and Ora not come? Maybe it wasn't convenient because of the holiday. They could've said something. They said they'd come. Ettie, darling, don't take it to heart. It's not because of you. People are busy. Maybe they've started preparing for Passover. Not everyone starts at the last minute. Why, was I ever late for Passover? Are you trying to make me angry? I didn't mean it. I'd rather see you angry than sad. Oh, you're here? I thought the earth swallowed you up. Ettie, I'm... sorry about yesterday... - It was inconvenient. Right. Inconvenient for everyone. I don't get you. Is this how you want to be? We don't need a women's section? We do, but that's not the way. - What is the way, Tikva? Now you're asking me? After you hired a contractor and called an emergency meeting you care what I think? - Where've you been? You don't show up, don't answer the phone. How am I supposed to ask you? Come, Ora. I'm in a hurry. What's with you, Tikva? - Forget it. Okay, I forgot it. Here. It's left over from last night. I can't eat your cooking. How can I eat her cooking? I don't know how strictly you keep kosher. Sorry, I don't eat that stuff any more. I've repented, thank God. And this is how you repent? You wanted to know what I believe? See this? This is what I believe. And this is howl intend to fix the women's section. And Ora agrees, and so does Dina and Bracha. We all do. You of all people, you need to repent more than anyone. - Stop it, Tikva. Why stop it? What do you want from me, Tikva? Open your eyes, Ettie. The tragedy happened at your celebration. Don't you think there's a connection? Maybe God is trying to tell you something, maybe you brought disaster on us. Don't say that, Tikva. Let's go. You know what I just thought of, Tikva? Our trip to Greece. That waiter who had a crush on you. He brought you pork chops on the house. But you didn't want to embarrass him. You pretended to eat it. And then threw all the food to the cats under the table. Remember? That's how you were. Before you repented. One box at a time, young man. So you'll make two trips. It's good exercise. Very good. You deserve a prize. Put it down carefully. Well done. Not that, Zion. Put it... wherever you want. How are you? - Thank God. Eliyahu, leave 6 glasses for the Seder and save the rest for after Passover. You're doing the Passover Seder here? Yes, a few students have no family here so the Rabbi is staying with them. He doesn't want them to be alone. Very nice. Are you staying to help? - No. I mean, yes, but I'm one of those who the Rabbi doesn't want to leave alone. Oh. You won't be alone. Have Passover dinner with us? Are you okay? How can I be okay? Can't you see who he is? Hasn't he done enough damage? I'm telling you, it's his fault nobody came yesterday, I'm sure of it. Did anyone tell you he said not to come? He didn't have to tell them. They got the message. He made them feel like criminals. He put such fear into them. Now they don't want anything. You're wrong, Ettie. You make him out to be a monster. He isn't. Get to know him, you'll see. He's a good man. You think everyone is good. He's not our kind. We aren't like him, Zion. All right. I won't bring anyone you don't want. Never mind. No. Invite him. What? You can't leave people alone for the holiday. Everybody's welcome. At least Tikva will eat my cooking if he comes for Passover. There may be something in it for you. Something. Don't ask questions. No, no, honey. Those aren't for Passover. I'll get different glasses. Will you go get ready now? Yes, I'm going... Osher. Are you still here? Everyone's at the synagogue. Bless your soul. You were so brave. Your grandfather still brags about you. No, Grandma, I'm not brave. It's my fault your synagogue was destroyed. How is it your fault? I didn't even learn the Bible portion. I kept praying to God that He'd perform a miracle so I wouldn't have to read it. But I didn't want Him to destroy it, I swear. What did you want Him to do? I dunno, make me faint or something. - Oh. You should've told Him more clearly. Stop it, Grandma. It's not funny. Do you really think you're so important that God would destroy a synagogue to save you from embarrassment? Is that what God does? Deal with personal complaints? God is much bigger than that. When Yaffa was four her mother was very sick. I prayed to God to heal her. I bugged Him no end. He'd never met such a pain in the neck. It didn't help. She died. Since then I don't ask Him for anything. That's when I realized that God doesn't work for me or for you. He brought you into the world with brains in your head and a guidebook in your hand. That's all you need. All you should do is thank Him. Auntie, what about the glasses? Oh no, the glasses! Happy holiday! - Happy holiday. Happy holiday. Blood. Frogs. Lice. Beasts. Disease. Boils. Hail. Locusts. Darkness. Death of the firstborn. Sir, please throw out this impurity. - Certainly. Zion. - What are you doing here? I can manage. Sorry, Zion. Trouble with Osher. I didn't mean to... - Not now, Ettie. If you didn't want him here you should've said so. Why did you tell me to invite him? To embarrass me? If He had taken us out Egypt and hadn't judged them It would have been enough If He had judged them and not their gods It would have been enough Enough, enough It would have been enough Enough, enough It would have been enough... The plague of darkness. There's a problem with the circuit breaker. Zion went to call a Sabbath Gentile. - No, God forbid. It's forbidden to use a Sabbath Gentile. How can we eat this way? We'll find a way, but let's not desecrate the holiday. Why is it a desecration? We've done it this way for years. Even my father used to call a Sabbath Gentile. Maybe out of ignorance, but thank God, we know the laws so we can avoid sin. Did you know my father, that you accuse him of ignorance? I didn't mean to insult your father's memory, but I can't disrespect the holiday. You call this respect? Eating in the dark? Is that what Jewish law wants? Thank God, the holy books are open to all. You can check. God gave us minds of our own, too. We don't always have to follow the most stringent laws. Everything is forbidden. God will get mad, God will punish us. - Stop it, Auntie. - What? Is that what a rabbi's supposed to do? Enter a community of good people and fill them with fear?! Happy holiday! The Sabbath Gentile is here. Welcome, Kappur. - Where's Zion? Here I am. What's the matter? - Zion, with your forgiveness, I must warn you that it's strictly forbidden to use a Sabbath Gentile. Zion, tell him to turn the light on. You know that isn't our custom. Well, Mr. Zion? Turn it on or not? Avram Yitzhak! Avram Yitzhak! Come, sweetie, I missed you. Do you want to play? - Avram Yitzhak! Avram Yitzhak, you're not allowed to be there! Come here. Come here. Go to Mommy, sweetie. It's all right. Some other time. Stop it, Auntie. I cleaned the other day. What do you care? Go get ready. Don't you have a date tonight? How did you know? I know the nervous look you get before a date. But who's the lucky guy? Just some guy. I'm calling it off anyway. Not that again... I'm serious, Auntie, I have an exam next week. I'll write you a note. Come on, get up. What? - Get up. - What? - Go get ready. Just pass by the house, there's bleach under the sink, it'll take out all the grime. What grime? It's all clean. You're crazy. And turn on the water heater. He'll be home any second. Go on... Hi, Yaffa, how are you? - Fine, Uncle. Is Ettie here? No, I just came to get something. Is she at your place? Give her time. She'll get over it. Yaffa. Yaffa? Listen, it looks like I'll have to sleep at Rabbi Menashe's, he isn't feeling well, so... tell Ettie to come home. And you come too, so she doesn't sleep alone. Ah. That's way too much. Don't worry about it. So where do we stand? I'll match her. - There you go. Forget it. It's no good. They don't want to build the women's section. - Why not? They're being punished. That pigsty is their penance. They're waiting for God to send Michael and Gabriel to build the women's section. Okay, here's Michaela, here's Gabriela, and Yaffaela's here, too. Who can beat that? Huh? Well? Here's the money for the renovation. Tomorrow morning you deposit it in the synagogue account. Then you withdraw 60,000, in cash, and bring it to me. Got it? Sure, don't worry, I'll take care of it. So when are you giving me the money? There are a lot of postdated checks here. You know how it is, people gave what they could. Well done. Deposit it in the synagogue account. No problem, Rabbi. But what should I tell them? - Tell who? The women, they keep calling about fixing up the women's section, what should I tell them? First of all, congratulate them on their fine effort. But it's not so simple, Aaron. Tell them there are many religious issues involved in building a synagogue. We have to look into them deeply and patiently so we don't end up sinning, God forbid. Oh... All the best. I understand, Margalit, but... I'm listening. No, you aren't listening... - Shh! There are lots of postdated checks. What am I supposed to do about that? Your problem is, you're always in a hurry. So it'll take a few more days. A few more days? Don't move! We have the money, we have a contractor. Why wait? We want to start building already. Ouch! I told you not to move. - I didn't move. And don't talk nonsense, either. Oh, you're here? They're stingy with the hot water here. I'm going to get sick. Don't say that, it makes your bathing worthless. What did I say? - After the ritual bath you should feel holy, pure, elated, not grumpy. It ruins the whole experience. That's how I am, okay? You have to comment about everything... Enough already. I swear to God, I can't say anything around you. - Don't swear. See? - But you're taking the Lord's name in vain. It's one of the Ten Commandments. Are you worried about me? Who do you think? I don't know, Tikva. Maybe yourself. - Myself? That's right. Maybe you're afraid your atonement isn't enough for all your sins so you have to atone for everyone else. What sins? Huh? Tell me. What sins? Come on, Tikva. Don't you think I knew about the cigarettes you smoked on Sabbath? That you didn't separate milk and meat? That you watched TV on Friday night? I knew it all, honey. And I didn't say a word. So you liked it that way and now you don't. You've mended your ways. Fine. Enough. God will forgive you. You don't have to worry about us. Everyone should take care of his own account with God. I'm cold. Let's go. Ettie will never forgive me. And rightly so. After what you said? I wouldn't forgive you. You? You can't live without me. You stick to me like super-glue, you even spy on me. Who spies on you? So you smelled cigarettes. What are you, a bloodhound? - You smell from a mile away. Why do you smoke? Don't you know it's bad for you? You don't say? Professor Ora... Hey, Yaffa! How are you, honey? Okay. How are you, darling? Fine. Yes? Nice to meet you. Naftali. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Well, as they say... be well and we'll see you at happy occasions. - All the best. - Good night. Good night. Good night. - Good night. Come on. Let's go. Babayof? Aaron Babayof? Aaron Babayof! Just a minute! Babayof! Does Aaron Babayof live here? Who are you, sir? Hanania Rokah. He said to be here at 9:00. What should I do? - But it's not even 8:00 yet. Never too early for a good deed. What should I do? What good deed are you early for? A big one. Writing a Bible scroll. You write Bible scrolls? For 40 years now. What should I do? Good for you, that's holy work. Come in. - Not alone with a woman, ma'am. Sorry. - Oh. Wait, are you writing a Bible Scroll for Aaron? Who's Aaron? Oh! Aaron Babayof. Does he live here? No. Just listen. - No, you listen. We don't know anything about it. - But he told you he didn't order a Scroll. Then why would he be meeting a scribe? Rabbi David asked him to, that's all. What's he got to do with it? Is he our rabbi now? - He's temporarily helping Aaron with financial matters, that's all. Doesn't that seem fishy to you? That he holds up our money and then asks you to do this? Can't you put two and two together? What do you want from me? The Rabbi will be here soon. Ask him. Don't worry, we'll all talk to him. - Not us. We have nothing to say to him. You brought him in and made him think he can do as he pleases. If you keep treating him like your rabbi he'll keep thinking he is. And if, as you claim, he isn't your rabbi, here's your chance to tell him so. Not nice, he's coming all the way here to talk to you. Have a little respect. - That's right, respect. Why just a little? Lots of respect! But what about respect for us? "A man must respect his wife more than himself." Did you know that? I didn't say that, Maimonides said that. Or the other one... Who was it, Tikva? Maimonides. - Oh. The man's a genius. Good morning. Greetings. Greetings. - Good morning, Rabbi. Good morning. - With your permission, let me explain the importance of the scroll... Tikva. Just so you know, as long as you sit here silently you won't be seeing us. That's that. We'll see how you manage without a women's section. Excuse them, Rabbi, they didn't mean it. I understand them. They're right to be angry. When I look at them I understand how our forefather Jacob felt. After working for 7 years for Rachel's hand, 7 years, how he felt under the canopy when he removed her veil and there stood none other than her sister Leah. They worked hard for their section and they deserve to see their reward. But, sadly, it's my fate to be the bad guy here. The heartless thief. Why should they listen to me? You have to understand, I have no choice. I'm forced to harden my heart and bow to ritual law. These aren't contributions to a daycare center or a memorial. It's a synagogue. It's the House of the Lord, there are rules. Our sages studied every detail of the laws of the synagogue and ruled unconditionally: The Bible scroll comes before the women's section. My hands are tied. Who am I to contradict the great rabbis? I know this won't be easy. It's a great trial for your wives. And for you, too. But God willing, when we bring in the new Scroll, they'll understand. They'll say: Lucky it happened this way. Just as Jacob looked at the six sons Leah bore him and said: Lucky it happened this way. Excuse me, Rabbi David, our rabbi, Rabbi Menashe, is getting better. Soon, God willing, he'll be strong again. This is his congregation. And in this tricky situation I'm asking that we wait for his ruling. I'd be honored to wait for his ruling. Ora? Ora? Margalit? Margalit! Where did she go? Tikva? Tikva? Oh my God! Have you lost your mind? - Did I frighten you? Good. Now sit down. I have one thing to say to you, if you order that Bible scroll I'm leaving you. You'll come home to an empty house. But it isn't up to me. It's the rabbi's ruling, it's not my decision. It's your decision, Aaron, if you want to be an honest man or a thief. And I'm telling you now, I won't live with a thief. Why are you leaving? I haven't decided yet. Reserves duty. And don't forget to take your blood pressure pills. And the ointment. Thank you, Bat-Sheva. And since the collapse, how should I put it? His mind isn't what it was. He isn't himself. And how does this manifest? He doesn't speak, and when he does speak he's detached from reality. For example? For example, he speaks to his wife as if she's with him. And she's... in the hospital, unconscious. And recently he started talking to other people as if they were her. Even men. How old is he? Let's say 65. Sir... Do you know what day it is? A good day to you, righteous man. May the Creator grant you a long life, grace and kindness. Do you know who I am? Bat-Sheva, who's our guest? Elijah the prophet? I'm Professor Yeshurun. I'm a doctor. Of course. As it's written, "And Yeshurun waxed fat and kicked." Look, he's in a psychotic state. Probably an extreme reaction to his wife's condition. Bat-Sheva... We'll try medication and see if he responds. Thank you. One pill once a day, before meals. I want to see him again in another three weeks. The Three Weeks. Three weeks of repentance. Fateful days for the Jewish people. Evil decrees upon evil decrees with evil decrees of evil. He brings you his laundry to do? - Who? Oh. Don't be silly. Then who wears that? You? I'm crazy, aren't I? Crazy? You belong in the nuthouse, Ettie. Maybe I'll get a bed next to yours. Tikva... You know, you look pretty like that. Like this? - Really. It lights up your face. It'd suit you, too. Forget it. - No, really. - Leave me alone. Try it, you'll see. - Forget it, Tikva. Try it. - Forget it. - You're so stubborn... I missed you. What's with you, you goofballs? Sweetie! What's going on? Running away from Mommy again? You mustn't do that, sweetie. I'm sorry, Mr. Teitelbaum. - No, Mr. Yazdi. I came to ask if you don't mind the boy visiting you again. Any time, gladly. I beg your pardon. It was my mistake. - Yes. It was our mistake, we know that now. Your rabbi, Rabbi David, praised you to our rabbi, he said you're a true righteous man. He isn't my rabbi. What's his name? Rabbi David? - Yeah, Rabbi David. Look, I'm no righteous man and I never will be. I... The boy sees and hears things here. I can't keep him in a bubble like you do. Maybe he shouldn't come here. Sweetie, take this. Have a sweet day. Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath. And the kids were supposed to come. What can we do? Let's hope it's over by next Sabbath. Is Geoula here? - She's on the way. Dina and Ronit, too. Tova and Bracha are coming tomorrow. Only Miriam is still not sure, her husband Sasson doesn't feel well. Is there enough food? More or less. "Bless You, O Lord, King of the universe, "Who sanctified us and commanded us to kindle the Sabbath lights." Amen. Good Sabbath. "Bless You, O Lord, King of the universe, "Who separates holy from mundane, light from darkness, "the Jews from the nations and the 7th day from the 6 days of Creation. "Bless You, O Lord, Who separates holy from mundane." Amen. - Have a good week. A good week. - A good week. A good week. I don't know. Maybe this was a mistake. We didn't hear a word from them all Sabbath. Maybe they're happier without us. What choice do you have? Do you want that rabbi coming between you and Nissan? Is that the kind of Nissan you want? Instead of distancing them from him, we drove them right into his hands. How can they stand up to him? He has the world wrapped around his finger. You know how many followers he has? How his students worship him? How they honor him? - Too much honor. That's his problem. Maybe it's time we dishonor him a little. A flower? Thank you. Thank you for coming. I wanted an excuse to get away. Trouble, huh? War room. You don't understand. You know you're crossing over to enemy lines. Oh, no. Make sure we aren't being watched. She looks suspicious. Uh-oh. She's reporting us. You're done for. What does your aunt say about... About us? She says... She's like... Nothing. She hasn't said anything. You haven't told her. With everything that's going on, I don't know how she'd take it. I thought I'd wait and see if it's serious. - And? Is it serious? You gave me one flower. You call that serious? Are you afraid she'll say no because of... my rabbi? She'd never say no. She never tells me what to do. Is that so? And if she's against it? We'll discuss it. I'll persuade her. That is... if it's serious. Twenty people at most. No, no violence, God forbid! Of course. Yes, yes. Don't worry. Thank you. Good night. Good, that's taken care of. Are you really going to do it? I can't believe it. - I can't either, but... we have no choice, honey. Come upstairs. There's a lot of work to do. Okay. Come here and rest a little. Rest? Margalit will kill me. I'm going in. Will you come up later? I was going to tell you something, but if this is a bad time... A bad time? Are you crazy? Do you know how long I've waited for you to tell me something? How hard I try not to ask you about that something? And not say a word? So what's the story? Has he proposed? He gave me a flower. Big spender. Sweetheart... And his rabbi? He doesn't mind? I don't know. So what are we doing there tomorrow, exactly? No, you aren't coming. Not coming?! - No, sweetie. I won't let you embarrass yourself outside his window. They're all looking. Next thing, they'll throw peanuts at us. - Let them look. The sooner they come, the better. How embarrassing, Ettie. - Why embarrassing? Don't be silly. - We said we'd do it! Come join us. If you get tired, sit down. - Hold it up. Come over here. Stand up straight. - Higher. - Stand up so they can see you. Very good. Here we are. - Yeah. Here we are. Hello, dear sister. - Hello. My name is Gittie and this is my friend Leah. We're from "Thank God for Making Me a Woman." Here. We came right over when we heard. You're doing a wonderful thing. We'd be glad to help you. We have a lot of experience with protests. We can recruit media figures, women in culture and public officials. Thank you. - Anything we can do for you? Want to hand out flyers? Start over there. Naftali, call the lawyer. I want him to write a warning to every single Mussayof woman. Warning about what, Rabbi? - Slander. Libel. Disturbing the peace. Anything to get rid of them. And you, Talmi, go tell the printer to print up 100 posters with a Vehement Warning. In a huge font, XL paper. What should they say? "Beware of the disgraceful gathering at the gates of this Holy House. "We entreat every Jew who cares about the fate of Israel, "please stay away from this display of immorality. "Anyone who pauses here “is guilty of desecration. "You have been warned. "Run for your lives." That's shocking! Your voice is so shrill! I'd better run for my life! "He who fears God will head." "Heed." Any woman whose synagogue... has... I mean, doesn't have a decent women's section is welcome to join us. Women for women! And men, too, of course. I want to tell you something that Maimonides said. Tikva, what did he say? Do you know who Maimonides was? Rabbi Moshe son of... Where's Aaron? I haven't seen him in ages. Find him and tell him I need to talk to him. The important thing is that no students go out front and certainly not to the courtyard. Move all lessons to the rear classrooms, okay? Look at her. Did you come here to eat? This fruit salad is fantastic. You have to try it. What is it? Who brought this? Zion made this. - No. Sure. Definitely Zion's. He sends me fruit salad... Does he think he can bribe me? And make me forget everything? It's only fruit salad. Enjoy, honey. Good thing he isn't here, you'd eat him, too. Well? Any news? Are the pills helping? Not yet. It takes time, Mr. Zion. I'll go in and wash and then I'll go see him. Take your time. He has a guest. What guest? I don't know him. A guest. - What guest? I told you not to let anyone in. "If money was raised to build a synagogue "and they want to use money for something else, "it must be used only for holier purposes," like a Bible scroll. Hello, Zion. Good evening, Rabbi. I'm here to read the Rabbi a few laws. -I see. You know, Zion, the best remedy for the soul is scripture study. If you don't mind, it's his bedtime. "May it be Your will, our God and God of our fathers..." "Heal Menashe son of Sarah, "heal him and cure him and strengthen him and grant our wishes, "please, O Lord, heal him." Feel better, Rabbi. Your rabbi is a lucky man. You're so loyal it blinds you to reality. But he's in bad shape, Zion. You realize we can't delay such an important deed by waiting for his ruling. That deed will destroy our congregation. It'll tear us apart. You're mistaken, Zion. Your congregation was in ruins the day I met you. Since then I've given my all to put it back together, to put you back on the straight and narrow. And we're getting there, Zion. We mustn't give up now. You've done enough. Please leave us alone now. You really have done enough. I wish I could. How can I leave you without a rabbi, Zion? We'll wait for Rabbi Menashe. He'll be all right. How can you wait for him, Zion? Don't give in to the Evil Urge. You're doing the right thing, you already renovated his synagogue. All that remains is to add the crown. And then, God willing, he'll recover. You'll see. All the best. How can someone disappear like this? I don't know, Rabbi, his phone is turned off, he isn't at home. He hasn't come to synagogue for days. Nobody's seen him. I searched everywhere. I'll sign. But we need two signatures. - I'll sign with both hands. But Rabbi... you realize that's... that's like... like forgery. In terms of the law, it's like... like stealing. Tell me, Naftali, if, God willing, you have a son and his foreskin, God forbid, is leprous, what will you do? You must circumcise him, but you mustn't cut off leprosy. What will you do? Cut it off or not? You'll cut it off! And you know why, Naftali? Because positive commandments override negative commandments. And we're bringing in a new Bible. That's a huge positive commandment. Do you see what we're fighting for? So lay off the bureaucratic nonsense. Withdraw the money immediately. Regarding the girl, Naftali, I... hope you realize it's out of the question. Have no regrets. Zion... Zion, my friend... Zion... Zion, my friend. Get up, Zion. What is it, Rabbi? Take me to her, Zion. He brought Naftali with him. Just wait and see what I do to him. Not a word, Margalit. I'll kill you. Dear ladies, I'm here to let you know that today, God willing, the first letter of your new Bible scroll will be written. I can't believe Aaron signed. - I know it's hard, but please trust me. Lovingly accept this important deed. Please stop this. You're only disgracing yourselves. We aren't going anywhere. We're staying here until we have a women's section. Rabbi? Should I give them the letters? What kind of scroll will it be? Coming into the world through sorrow and contention, unwanted? It can't be a Holy scroll. The first letter you write and all the letters that come afterward, no matter how fancy you make them, they'll never become a bible scroll. And you will bring the scroll into our synagogue with sorrow, not joy. Alone. Just you and him. Because we won't be there. There will be no "we." Did you see how he ignored her? The ass. Shame on him. - Shame on you. "Without prejudice to my rights "I hereby inform you that according to Paragraph 263..." - No way! What? It's the check! It's the check! - Wow! Naftali gave us back the money! I came to bring this back. That's nice. I need it. The fruit salad was delicious. I'm glad you liked it. I missed it so badly. I missed it very much. Very much. It was hard for me, too. I'm nothing without it, she's my whole life. The bowl. Oh, my dear Ettie... Pull, pull. - Hold it. - I'm holding it. You hold that end. Put all the books back in the bookcase. - We'll take out the benches. And roll up the carpets. What were you thinking? Sorry, Rabbi. I had to do it. Ah, praise His name. What a beauty. Fix her veil. The sound of joy and gladness The voice of the bride and groom The sound of joy and gladness The voice of the bride and groom... Prayers, sir? Gladly.
