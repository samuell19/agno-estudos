Hello people. It's me, Jeremy again. Today, I want to talk about fight or flight. Now, when you hear fight or flight, you're usually thinking about a threatening situation where you have two options, fight or flight. Now, if you choose fight, you're considered brave, and courageous, and bold. But if you choose flight, you're weak, and soft, and a coward. Why is that? Because isn't fight or flight supposed to achieve the same goal? To live? And why do we worry so much about what other people think. In high school, it's tough enough without everyone judging you. I guess all I want in life is to... Jeremy, dinner's ready! Coming mom! You know what? Forget it, alright? I just want people to mind their own business and just live the life that they wanna live. You know, and I hope that one day I'll be able to live a life I'm happy to live with. To live out my own dreams.

Well, it's my birthday in two days, and I'm really excited to be 18. Okay, so is that why you're doing a lot of selfies and posting? You know it. I'm excited for you, babe. Thank you! All right, I have to go before Ms. Morris has a fit. I think she just hates that I look prettier than her in pink. Well, you look prettier in just about anything. Stop. Boo! What the hell, Jules! You scared me. I still can't believe you love Tiffany. She's a fake, Jeremy. When are you gonna realize that? Look, I know that you like Tiffany, but she isn't gay, okay? So you can just stop that. Yeah, me? Like Tiffany? - Yeah. - Yeah, in your dreams. I think Alexis is better than her anyway. Wait, since when did you and Alexis, you know, become a thing? It's been a few weeks now. Good luck. But I don't need your advice, okay? Just stay outta my business and I'll stay outta yours. I got this. Hey Jeremy, look at me. Jules, I told you to stop doing that. Sorry, I can't help it. Your cheeks, they're kinda like a magnet for my hand, plus I love doing it way too much. Go away, Jules. Fine. But just remember I told you so. Hi. Oh! Hi, Dr. Vasan. I know, I know, No cell phones, I'm putting it away right now. Wait a minute. So how are you and your mom doing since everything? Oh, my mom's good, I'm good, we are good. We don't need him. I'm gonna get to class, can't be tardy. So Tiff, um, you're going to homecoming with me, right? Hey! Yeah, of course. Okay, so you can come by and have dinner with me and my family tonight? Tonight? I can't 'cause my brother's getting back from India, so, rain check? Yeah, sure. Next time. Yeah, next time. Hey Tiff. Hey, call me later okay? So how about next week? Yeah, let me get back to you on that, okay? Hey! I love you. Love you too. Oh hey, this is my ride. We can do dinner, but you know what I'd really love? What's that? Sundae Shakes. I love their cheesy fries. You got it! ♪ I'm thinking about times that I wake ♪ ♪ I wish that I was with you ♪ ♪ I'm sorry if that was your girl ♪ ♪ Man, you know that I had no proof ♪ ♪ But I'm in love ♪ Say Miss, you model? Me? Not really, but maybe one day. Could have fooled me. You might as well be one now. Why? Have you seen yourself? You're gorgeous. Thank you. Hey, wait. A face like yours should be on billboards downtown. I got a friend who runs an agency. Would you be interested? I could connect you two. An agency, like a modeling agency? Yeah, so what do you say? Um, I don't, I don't know. I'll have to think about it. Okay, look, I only refer girls to him if I think they have something. When I see you, I see something. You could be a big star. All you gotta do is just send him an email. This could be your big break. Okay. Look, just email him, tell him Richard sent you. You could make some money out of it. Okay, thanks. Boo! Boy, stop sneaking up on me like that. Where have you been? Just hanging out with Tiffany? Oh, Tiffany. How is she doing? I seen some of her little selfies. Is she keeping warm? Yes, mom. She is! You know, she just trying to be a model. Hmm, oh. So I made some of your favorite, honey garlic chicken. For real? Uh-huh, your dad will be home soon, so clean your room and get started on that homework, all right? All right. So how was work? Stressful. But I will tell you what? I sure am looking forward to our little vacation coming up. Me too! Ew, guys. Ugh. Stop. So son, how's school? It's fine, dad. You're going to homecoming, right? Yeah, with Tiffany. Tiffany? Son, how many times do I gotta tell you? You gotta watch out for girls like that! George. Jeremy likes her, let it go. Baby, I'm just trying to protect the boy. I don't wanna see him get hurt. Sooner or later, she's going to leave him. Dad, you don't know that. Jeremy, eat your food. George, leave him alone. Tiffany's not gonna leave me. All right, all right. - Hey. - What do you want, Ethan? Thing is, help me out? What did I tell you about turning up on my doorstep this late? You said to call, but I'm sorry, I just figured you'd be good for it, if you don't mind. But I do mind. Please Hunter, come on. Just a little. I'll be out the door. Come on in. I've been seeing your girl post a lot of selfies. What? Your girl. She's been posting a lot of selfies. She's not my girl. For real? What happened between you two? I'm not gonna tell you again. You better call next time. Yeah, sorry. Jeremy, Tiffany's fighting with Ethan! What? One more word about Jeremy and you're dead, Ethan. Who, that nerdy Black kid? Tiff, he's a coward. What is your problem with him anyway? It's not like he ever did anything to you. He didn't do anything to me? He stole you away from me! We were over before we even started, Ethan. Jeremy, come show Ethan that you're not afraid of him. You know, you might look tough, but you're pathetic. Jeremy and I are together. You're just gonna have to deal with it. Besides, you're too self-centered to even care about me. What are you looking at? If you've got any balls, then step out from behind your girlfriend. What's up? Jeremy? See? What a coward. All right, all right. What's going on here? You all need to get to class. Leave! Get to your classes. Come with me. Ethan, what happened? Nothing. Coach Fields said you are not playing football this year. Why not? I don't feel like playing. How are you and your father doing? Ethan. Sometimes the pain we feel leads us to make destructive decisions. We done? Ethan. There are some people who care about you. My door is always open. You can come here anytime if you need to talk. Nobody cares about me. So Jeremy, what are you going to do? Huh? What are you going to do? I was gonna go to class. I mean, I don't, you know, hang out in the hallways... This is your senior year. You are coming to in this year with 4.2 GPA and a great attendance. Oh, I really don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm sorry, is this about what happened earlier? Jeremy. You are among the few students who have a perfect grade point average in this school. It says a lot. Do you know what that means? I don't know, that I do a lot of homework? Valedictorian. Not only that, it means you need to be a leader, not be a follower. Not a leader, just a regular guy. Got a great GPA, and I can't even stand up for myself. Being a leader is not about fighting, but strength. It's about you being an influence and not being influenced by others. You have to guide your peers and not to be led by the crowd. You understand? Go and think about it. Now you can go to your class. About Ethan, okay, I didn't think he was gonna come at me like that and... Enjoy the rest of your day. ♪ Spirits, angels rise up ♪ ♪ Yeah, you still got time ♪ ♪ Yeah, we're the lucky ones ♪ ♪ Ones, ones ♪ ♪ Living every day like it's our very last ♪ Hey! Hey. Look at me, Jeremy. What happened? I just hate fights. I know that, but Tiffany's pissed. She feels like you embarrassed her. No, but I can't fight Ethan. You know he's not gonna let this go. Yeah, I know. And Tiffany, what are you gonna do about that? Just gonna have to apologize to her, I guess. Okay, but not a plain apology, a cute, sweet, romantic apology? I don't know if I can do that, Jules, but I'll try! Do or do not, there is no trying. Thanks Jules. Nah, keep your thank you's. Just have your mom make me some of her honey garlic chicken. Done. But seriously, you can't let people punk you like that. Okay, I know, alright? I know! Well, at least you know. Anyway, I gotta get home and do some studying. I have a test tomorrow in history and would hate to get an F. See you! Hey Jules, wait. Thanks. Jeremy, you know I didn't do hugs. Ah, whatever. - Bye. - Bye! Hey Tiff. Jeremy, stop! Sorry about what happened earlier, okay? I just couldn't... What couldn't you do, Jeremy? Fight for me? Show Ethan that you weren't a coward? 'Cause yeah, you couldn't do that. Look, it's not like that. I don't want to hear another word, Jeremy. I thought you were special, different from other guys, and I guess you are, just not in the way I thought you would be. Tiffany. I know, okay? And I'm not even too proud about what happened either. Alright? But just understand that sometimes I can... There's nothing to understand, Jeremy. No, you're a coward. You can't fight for me, and you can't even fight for yourself, and I'm done. Tiffany wait, okay? I wish it didn't have to come to this, but today you proved to me that I need a man, and you're still a little boy. Even Ethan was willing to fight for me. Tiffany, just hear me out... Goodbye Jeremy. Tiffany wait, let me just say... No Jeremy, I'm done! ♪ Checked off your list of goodbyes ♪ ♪ You're sick of Saturday nights ♪ ♪ When I'd call you ♪ ♪ You ain't got time ♪ Just a stupid coward, yeah. You think I should do this? Where were you? I was at a friend's house. Come inside. What did I tell you about coming in this house drunk? I'm sorry dad, I wouldn't have come home. I didn't know you were home. No, no, no. Sorry is not gonna cut it tonight. Please, just... You know the rules, boy. Dad, please! You need to understand the value of hard work, Ethan. No more drinking and partying! Dad, dad, please, please. I won't drink again! Please... How dare you raise your voice at me, shut up. I thought I would give you a chance, but you know what? You are the biggest disappointment in my life. You're grounded for a month. I want you to come straight home from school. You understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, sir. I work hard, and all he does is drink and have fun. Who the hell is that? Caitlin! Hi! Hey, what are you doing here? Actually, I brought you some leftover apple pie from the get together. I thought you and your son would like some. Yes, thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. You're welcome. Would you like to come inside and have a glass of wine or? That is so sweet of you, but I think I must pass. I have already had too much tonight. So. Come on. Please? Come on, just a glass, or half a glass! All right, okay. Half a glass can't hurt, so. Can't hurt! Hm, delicious. Thank you. Yeah, my sister got it for me in France. That's amazing. You know, I could get you a bottle. Really? I would love to share this with my husband. Thank you, Tim. No problem. I should probably leave now. Ah, it's getting late. Okay. - Thank you. - Sure. So I will see you later then? Sure, you know where I live. Yes, thank you Tim. Don't mention it. Yeah. What if I stop by again tomorrow night around this time? My husband's in Canada for business, so. Yes! Yes, that would be great. All right, well it's a date. It's a date. Okay, bye. Boo! Jules, I told you to stop doing that. Sorry, I can't help it. Anyway, how are you doing? I just feel... Empty? Yeah. Hey, think positive. One, because I hate negative people, and two, because thinking negatively won't do you any good. Look, Jeremy. I get it. I won't even tell you to forget about Tiffany or anything. I just know you'll find someone better than her. You know she's not the only fish in the pond. Jules, it's fish in the sea. Yeah, same thing. Oh, I almost forgot. Did you hear about Ethan? No, what happened? I heard he went to a party the other night and came home late, and his dad got pissed and beat the hell out of him. - Really? - Uh-huh. Nelson said he was with this guy, Hunter. We've heard of him, haven't you? Yeah, I read about him in a couple of newspapers like that before. Newspapers? Seriously Jeremy, what century are you living in? Hey, quiet! Whatever. Now Ethan didn't come to school today and Nelson's too scared to go to his house and check on him. Man, I'm pretty sure Ethan would be okay. I just hope he doesn't come back until after graduation. You know, I still feel bad for him. Okay sure, he's a bully, but what his dad did still isn't right. Forget about Ethan, okay? Look, I need you right now. All right? And you're the only one that I can talk to. You're just mad that Ethan punked you, that's it. But you know, I may have to agree with Tiffany a little bit on this one. Jules, not you too. No, like, believe it or not, she's right. You are a bit of a coward. Bye Jules. No, look. Can you just step it up and be brave? Be that night in shining armor for Tiffany. If not Tiffany, then for someone else. The point is sometimes you need to put up your fists and fight. You know me. No matter what, I'll always be here for you. But Jeremy, you need to stop being so scared. Scared? Don't you tell me about being scared. You're the one that's scared to tell your parents about what the piano teacher did. Can you two keep it quiet, please. Jules, look. I'm sorry! Way to go, Jeremy. Ms Smith? Is everything okay. Yeah, I just can't get this damn. I can't get my locker open. Go and wait in my office. Tell me the number. 17. 17. 32. 32. 17. 17. Open! Thanks. I know it can be hard to find the words when you are hurting, but sometimes it helps to try. For all of us. Oh my God. That feels so good. Where did you learn to do that? I have always been good with my hands. I bet you are. I actually thought about going to school for this. Oh? Oh! Where's Hunter? Who is it? Yo, it's me, Ethan. Come on in. Woo! Now that's what I call a kick. So what do you need today? Just the usual. I don't got it. But I promise you, you know I'm good for 100. I'll get it. You know I don't play about my money. You know the rules. First the money, and then you can get the candies. I mean, this is all I have, all I've got right now. Are you seriously joking with me right now? You think you can just come up here and do whatever you please? You think I'm gonna give you quality stuff for a couple of dollars? Huh? It's all I got. Then get the hell out of here before I slice your balls off and throw them to her. You'd love them, wouldn't you? I'm sorry, Hunter. Get out. Get out! Hey! What? What's wrong? What do you want from me? What the hell happened to your eye? Okay, don't answer, but I can get you some candies if you want. How? ♪ Low, I don't want you low ♪ He's gone. Yeah, you sure he's got what we need though? Trust me. All right, where's it at? Look in the master bathroom, under the sink. He keeps it in a black box with a red top on it. Hurry up!

Anyway, how about it? How about it? I can't believe that he pulled that off, can you? Oh my God, I can't either. While we're in, I am so glad Kendall introduced me to you. I'm so glad too. You look so hot in that outfit. We can talk about that a little bit later. But first talk about this. - Did you hear that... - What was that? I don't know. Hold still. Do you lure guys like that all the time? Lure? Look. You almost got me killed. You gotta do what you gotta do to survive, right? Wait! There's no need to rush. What about Hunter? What about him? He doesn't own me. Why, are you scared of him? No, um... I should go. Are you sure? I've got the room all night. Yeah, yeah, I should go.

We'll be gone a week. You can have one or two friends over, but no parties. Understand? Alright. Listen, be careful wearing that hoodie around town. You heard about what happened to that boy in Florida. He was the same age as you. So when you walking through this neighborhood, don't have that hoodie up. Some people might be scaredy scared of you. Scared of me? Yeah right. Love you, son. Love you too, dad. Oh, one more thing. Make sure... George, I'm ready! You know what, nevermind. Ugh, nasty. All right, all right. All right, settle down. Excuse me, thank you. All right. So today we're gonna do a little writing assignment. Come on, guys. Believe me. It's not going to be easy, but the topic is fear. Many of us have one fear or another hidden inside of us, and it could be the fear of spiders, or the fear of darkness, or even the fear of embarrassment, but it is there. And so what I want you to do is I want you to write on the story behind that fear. You guys get me? Yes, sir. Perfect! All right then, if you have any questions, please raise your hand. Otherwise, take out your pens and your pencils, and let's start writing. Do not rush. Let's get it done, people. Hey, Jeremy. Hey. Hey, where's Tyler? Hey Jeremy. Hey Jason! Nice costume, man. Yeah, thanks man. You too! I don't see your toast? Yeah, I haven't found him yet. Alright, well, alright man, enjoy the party. Look at this as your own house. Not my words, Tyler's. - Okay. - See you, bro. You got this, Jeremy. You got it, just go over there. Just say hey, how you doing? Just do it, come on. Hey. Looks like I found my toast. Don't get me started. This is my sister's, and it sucks. I wish this party would just end. Hey, the party's not that bad. They've got beer, they've got music. And there's Sheila and Tyler making out. So that's where he's been all this time. Like why can't they just do all of that in the room? Tell me about it. And that's why I hate parties. Especially costume parties. You know, the party's not that bad! I mean, sure, they're over there feeding on each others faces, but that's only because they've been going out for a while. So we have a Tyler fan here, huh? Okay, whoa. No, he's just my best friend. Okay, this party does suck. Yeah. So what's your name? You know, I'm actually not that comfortable saying my name to a complete stranger. A stranger? I think we shared more than 100 words, which, yeah, that makes us not strangers. It's Jules. Nice to meet you, Jules. I'm Jeremy. Nice to meet you too, Jeremy. I'm sorry, I didn't. I leaned in, you just got. So do you know where the room is? Actually, I do. Damn, that was something. Yeah, it was. Can I tell you a secret? If you trust me enough? This was actually my first time. - Yeah? - Yeah. What's wrong? I gotta get home. My mom's gonna kill me if I come home late. Okay, can I take you home then? No, it's all good! Thanks though. Jules, hey? It's dark out, and there's a bunch of drunk lunatics with fruit costumes on. Look, I just wanna make sure that you make it home safe. Okay. You think it's too late to go trick or treating? Oh, I know this great pizza place round the corner. You know, maybe I could take you out sometime? We could hang out. Hey Jeremy, there's something I probably should tell you. What is it? So the thing is... I'm gay, and I know I probably should have told you that before, but I think I just figured it out. Was I that bad? No, no, no, no. It wasn't you. I'm sorry, Jeremy. I ruined your night and your first time. Stupid. No. No, it's okay. I'm just glad that you told me. Really? Yeah. I mean, not too many people are open about how they feel, but I'm just glad that you trust me with that. I didn't think you'd be this understanding. And now you know. And it was good either way, so... Oh, you are so stupid. Alright everyone, keep your papers, but I expect your complete assignment by the end of next week, okay? Alright everyone, have a good day.

I know how hard it must be for you, but trust me, you're doing better. You hungry? A little, yeah. I got some leftover spaghetti that my mom cooked. Jules? Hey Alex, what's up? My cousin's here, so I was hanging out with her. What are you doing here? Oh, I just thought maybe you and I could go out. I'm so sorry, but I can't. You know what, it's okay. Are you sure? Yeah, I should have called you before. Oh, these are for you by the way. I hope you like them. I'm sorry Jules, but whatever this is, I can't accept it. I know you came here to hang out, but I already love someone. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept this from you. But I think of you as a really good friend, so hopefully we can continue with that, hmm? Okay. Yeah, sorry to distribute you. Goodnight, Alexis. Gosh, why am I being so open? Is it the beer? Nah, I don't think it's the beer. I mean, we're friends. I just think you trust me enough to talk to me. Yeah, I guess you're right. So your story? Yeah. So it was about a year ago and I was taking piano lessons. There were a lot of other kids there, but I was the only one with an extra hour. The dude taught me many tricks and tips to help me learn the piano. Then one day, he just touched me. I regret I didn't tell my parents what happened after that. I just hate myself so much right now. If only I'd had the guts to tell this to my parents. What are you waiting for? They deserve to know more than I do. But I'm scared, Jeremy. I'm scared that they'll abandon me because I'm not the girl they thought I was. You gotta give them a chance, Jules. I mean, at least. Sure, they'll be mad, but not because of you. You think so? You think I should tell my parents what happened? Yeah. Trust me. You'll feel better, and what's the worst thing they're gonna do? Throw pie in your face? Oh, you're so stupid! But thanks, Jeremy. Ah, no problem. I'm just glad you're taking a wise man's advice. Okay, now this is unfair. Now I feel like you have something to blackmail me with, and I still don't have anything on you. Well let's keep it that way, shall we? Oh hell no! I opened up to you, it's only right you do the same. When did this ever become a rule? Since tonight, and since that time you kissed me. Fair enough. Well, what is it? I just feel like you're gonna laugh, but, you know you were the first girl I ever flirted with? Wait, what? Wait, are you being freaking serious? Huh. I thought you were like a literal Playboy. Really? Were my lines that good? Not really. You just seem like a natural. Thanks. If only you didn't tell me that you were gay, I'd kiss you again. You know, I think this makes us friends officially. Boy, we were friends in the moment we saw each other. Oh, I like that. Okay, do you think we should get that on t-shirts and sell them? Not a bad idea, friend. You think we should leave? No, I don't really want to go yet. Thanks Jeremy. Yeah, no problem. This is real drug, man. For real. Yeah, everybody loves my mom's cooking. Where are your parents? In Vegas. You should, um, let your parents know you're here. I mean, they may be worried. My dad doesn't care about me. What about your mom? She, uh. She died a few years back. I'm sorry, man. Ever since then, my dad hasn't been the same. I haven't been the same. But dad literally hates me. I don't think he does. He may just have a weird way of showing he loves you, but I don't think he hates you. Yeah, he does. Trust me. You know why I hated you? Ever since my mom died, Tiffany and I got really close. Her dad left her mom around the same times. We became each other's shoulder than lean on. That's why I hated you, 'cause I blamed you. I blamed you for taking away the only reason I had to live. I'm sorry, man. I didn't know. It's over, you know? I gotta deal with it. It's funny how life works, 'cause now you're the only one that's willing to help me. Yeah, I know, and you're the reason why Tiffany dumped me. For real? I guess we're even. Yeah, we're even. Good riddance to us. God, when she got mad? She's gnarly... Yeah she blew up, man. Should have seen her. Jeremy! Get up here and stand up for me! Wait, wait, wait. Shortcut, shortcut. Get knowledge. Who's that? I don't know, go answer it. Oh, you better not let Wave Chappelle win. Where the hell's my son? Ethan, Ethan? Ethan! Where's my son? Ethan isn't here. Tell me where my son is right now, or I will call the cops and put you behind bars so quick. You have no idea the connections I have. Ethan? With all due respect, sir, Ethan isn't here, I don't know where he is... Don't lie to me, kid. My neighbor saw you with him a couple of days ago. You tell me where he's at right now. Enough of this camp bullshit. Ethan? Dad. Ethan, when did you get here? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? The question is what are you doing here, Ethan? I came to hang with my friend Jeremy for a few days. Seriously, him? Yeah dad, my friend. Okay guys, look. Let's take it slow and steady. Mr Miller... Get out of here. What the hell, relax! This is enough, Ethan. We're going home right now. I'm not coming home. What did you say to me? Okay, look, look. Come on, we can just talk about this. What did I tell you... Dad, stop! You alright? Mr Miller. Your son is a good kid, alright? He deserves better than you. Enough, we're going home. No dad, I'm not coming home with you. What did you say? I'm tired of living under your abuse. What did you do to my son? Dad, I'm done living my life like an addict who's got nothing better to do. And Jeremy's done nothing but help me. You think you're better than me? But you know what? You're the biggest disappointment in my life. Oh yeah? Well, I come from you. One more word and you're dead. You think I'm afraid of you? I'm not scared of you anymore, dad. You can't control me, you can't even control yourself. Look at you. Mr Miller! Mr Miller, stop! Get off me, get off me! Son of a bitch. Stop! Alright, come on. Hey, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Oh no, oh no. I'm gonna go get some rest. I suggest you do the same. Oh, hey. Call the cops for me? And an ambulance too? What are you gonna tell the cops? Self defense. Sometimes you gotta stand up and fight. You gotta face your fears, and tell it that you're done worrying, you're done hiding, and show the world who you really are behind that fear. And once you do that? The world becomes, it becomes much more different. And it becomes livable, enjoyable, and you can, you can just breathe. Now, this is nothing that I'm just speaking randomly or anything like that. It's just, I lived it, and I realized that fear? It's nothing that to be afraid of. And arms lengthening down by your side. On breath in, reach your arms... Hey, mom? Hey, sweetheart. Can we talk? You okay? Ethan! Do I have to do this? Yes. Trust me, this is better than DIY treatment. Yeah, but I'm clean. I'm good. Ethan, if you really wanna get better, this is the right way and only choice that you have. Alright, alright. Hi, how can I help you? Hey, my friend here wants to get clean, so can you tell us about the programs that you guys have please? Of course! Follow me and I'll take you to the counselor. He'll help you decide which programs are best for you. Right this way. Alright, let's go. One. Two. Man, shut up. You're worse than my pops. Tiff? What are you doing here? I just came to apologize, because I know that I was harsh and I know that I hurt you. Can you please accept my apology? What's going on, is everything okay? No, nothing's right. Everything's kind of falling apart. Wanna go for a walk in the park? Yeah. Please say something. What do you want me to say, Tiff? Look, I'm sorry about what happened to you, but why are you telling me this? Because there's nobody I can talk to. Tiffany, everyone loves you! I'm pretty sure you can, you got plenty of friends to talk to... Yeah, but there's nobody I can trust. Tiff. Look, I know I acted selfishly, but can you please just give me another chance? I promise that. No Tiff, stop. I promise that I won't... Stop! Look, the thing is, even if I wanted to date you again, I don't think that we should. Why? Because. Because you already love somebody else? No, it's nothing like that. It's just I think that we just end up hurting each other. Look, I promise. I promise I will never hurt you again. Tiffany, you can't promise that. Look. Look at me, Tiffany. No. If you ever need me, you know I'll always be there for you.

So how have things been? Hey, why do I feel like it's been a long time since we last talked? Because it has been, silly. Jules, I'm sorry. You forgive me? Never. Okay, what is up with you and Ethan by the way? People are saying you beat up his dad. Ethan's actually a good guy. I've been helping him out with a few of his issues. You know what'd be so good right now? What? Well, there's this pizza place not too far from my house. Maybe you and I should go sometime. Like tonight? Well, if we rush, we can get there before they close. Seriously? Are you sure, Jules? Jeez, Jeremy, you are terrible at this. Let's go before they actually close. You know, I knew you was gonna come around eventually. Yeah, me too. I don't know what it was though. It was my swag! Jeremy got a lot of it. No, no, no, no. That's not it.
