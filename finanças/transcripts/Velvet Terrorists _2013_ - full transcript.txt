presents a film by My name is Stanislav Kratochvíl. I was arrested for terrorism and got 5 years in prison for trying to blow up a tribune for the May Day parade. I didn’t like the Communists. Now I live in Sereď, I live alone, and I’m doing fine. I’m like a lone traveler in the desert, I bother my friends on the phone every night, I don’t know how to be alone, I don’t want to be alone... - Hi, I’m Stano. - Hello. You’re very quiet... Where shall we start? - Where do you work? I work in a grocery store, behind the deli counter. I’ve been divorced for 17 years now, I have three kids, two small grandchildren. I live with my youngest, 20-year-old son. I’ve been alone for a while now. - And you? - I’m single. Have you ever been married? No... I've missed out on that. Have you had girlfriends? Yes... but I haven’t found the right one yet. - Girls are all pretty... - But what color hair does he like? First you check out how she looks, her boobs, her butt, her legs... I like brunettes, he likes blondes ... or redheads. It depends... You don’t even have to talk to her, you just take a look at her... Blondes are pretty and brunettes are also pretty... - If she's pretty, she's pretty. - That's true... But there has to be something about her... I prefer dark hair, blondes are very cunning... - You want a strawberry? - Give me... - Delicious, right? - Yes, thanks. It’s the best thing in the world. This is gorgeous. - Do you like this picture? - Yes, it’s beautiful. Have you been married before? No. I’ve tried but it didn’t work out. Life can be hard. I’m divorced, so... I’ve been disappointed. - Long story, right? - Yes, long... and painful. He didn't leave me anything. I didn’t expect him to behave like he did. Sure... things happen that you don’t expect. Things happened to me too that I didn't expect. - That’s why it’s so hard. - It is. - 70... - That’s good! - 70 - 70 - 70. Waistline 70? She is like you! Then 90 - 70 - 90. Sounds good. There were blondes, redhead, all kinds... - Her eyes? - I don’t know. Jeeze, but that’s the main thing! - Whatever... - Eyes are the windows to the soul. - I don’t see anything there. - Because you’re blind! Dude, how can you tell what she’s like? In jail I needed to suss out people. I had to know who’d rat on me and who wouldn’t... I can tell what people are like but it takes a few days or weeks. You can’t judge people in 15 minutes. - You’re not that good. - No, I’m not. Look, I’ll keep her for a month or two, I'll see into her soul. And if it doesn’t work then – Goodbye! - I went to visit a friend in jail. It's not a bad life there. They’re crying how bad they’re treated... Now it’s like a summer camp! Not like under the Commies - I heard that you were locked up too. - Yes. - What for? - Just a stupid prank... What did you do? I wanted to blow up a tribune before the May Day parade. - Where was this? - In Sereď. - Why? - I was pissed at the Communists. - How long? - Five years. That’s not so bad, for such a thing... - This was still during Communism? - Right, in 1984. - What was it like in there, back then? - It was hard. Very hard. I had a room, fuck them, 2x4 meters! Like this... Imagine a room like this to live in - there to shit, to eat. Like a lion in a cage, even worse! - This was the cell. - That small? This was the toilet ... and the door was here. You're shitting and a guy is staring at you. A bunk-bed was here for two, here you had two nightstands, here a chair and a small table for eating. This was my living space. This is where you walked. That’s too small even for a pig! That was life during Communism. To say that Stano is a star citizen is bullshit, but he lives a normal life in this country, He wanted to see the world, he dreamed of America Of a better life, more cheerful... The Communists tortured us, exploited us. I didn’t want to run. I wanted to see the world – the Grand Canyon and the Mississippi in America, and New Zealand, Australia, Africa... The pyramids! That’s what I care about, not democracy and all that. The Americans were killing their blacks too. Whatever! There is something nice to see in every country. - Can I say something? - I love traveling, and we couldn't. Look at Schuster – a Communist, and they made him President! He didn’t give a shit about the country, he went all over the world! He was a puppet, a Communist – there were floods here and he was over there... ... hunting those – what’s the word? – snakes! That was some President! The whole world was laughing at us. Millions of people wanted democracy and then vote for a Communist to become President! And we still have a Communist President - CENSORED! That Communist bastard! He has Czechoslovak Communist Party tattooed on his back. How can this be democracy if we’re still ruled by Communists!? - Double it! - This gun is stuck, fuck! There he is! Aim lower, shoot! A lamb is better than a woman. A woman is for 10-15 minutes, a lamb lasts longer. - What shall we talk about? - About us. - Do you have any hobbies? - I like to go fishing. - And your hobbies? - I have many. Sports, art, culture, so many things. We don’t have that much in common then... - Why did we even meet? - Why did we meet? Because you don’t want to be alone. - I’ve never been so lucky... - She’s 180 cm tall... Long legs, B-cup tits... Can you believe it? And in bed – one leg touching the window, the other up to the ceiling. Fuck me... I asked her what she liked to do, she said - going to the theater and crap like that... You know city women, they’re not into fishing... But she asked about your bank account, right? And you tell her – My boss owes me big bucks. You have to fool them, they’re all after your money... The theater, my ass... - Have you been in love? - Sure, when I was young. - So what happened? - They sent me to jail. To jail? For what? Just a stupid thing I did. I wanted to blow up a tribune they built for the May Day parade. - To blow it up? When? - 1984. I was angry at the Communists and I didn’t know what to do about it, so I thought I’d show them that not everybody likes them. So you were directly involved? I had a picture of the KISS on my shirt and the police beat me and made me remove it. Really? Communist cunts, they don’t deserve any better! I’ll fix these parts and it’ll blow up real nice – right, uncle? You wanted to blow up a tribune full of people? No, it was at night, there was nobody there. They really fucked me up... I sat around here, there was the light, and the tribune over there. As I worked on it, the police came and knocked it out of my hand. And then what happened? Did you manage to do it? No, they caught me – there were guards at night. I was convicted and sent to jail. The cop asks me how I meant to do it. I showed him – put the dynamite underneath, and it would lift up the platform, nothing big... This guy calls the others – Come listen to this! They cancelled the whole May Day parade. - So you achieved what you wanted... - Sort of... We’re going to die together! Don’t worry... My name is František Bednár. In 1984 I was convicted of terrorism, according to Act no. 93 for sending a package with explosives to a Secretary of the Communist Party. I was planning to assassinate Czechoslovak President Gustáv Husák. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. I’m married with two kids, I live in Poprad. - Don’t people usually say “happily married”? - It’s such a commonplace. Now show me how it was on your wedding photo. - You forgot? - I was looking that way. - Did you embrace each other? - No! Back then it was very discrete. Step forward, and you boys behind them. Just like that, great! And now smile everybody. I’ll show you how I used to rehearse escape 30 years ago. We planned our mission to get weapons and explosives. We were rehearsing "handbrake turn". You speed up in reverse and then suddenly jerk the wheel as fast as you can. That sends the car into a tailspin and it turns around. Now let’s try. - From whom you were escaping? - From guards, policemen... Anyone, who was on the crime scene. Get ready! I knew it won’t go this time. - What am I supposed to do? - The same thing I did. - I can’t do that! - Of course you can. - Which way? - Back up, add gas. - I can’t see a thing. - Doesn’t matter, turn the wheel! Now 1st gear, and go! Then hand-brake and turn! Add gas and pull the hand-brake! Watch out for the tire! - Damn it! - Damn it! - Go, turn to the right! - Damn it! The first thing I recommend is the courage to be a fool. A fool in the most beautiful sense. Let’s try to be fools and demand change of what is said to be unchangeable. Everyone of us should realize that however insignificant they are, they can change the world. That is if we believe that there are things that are worth suffering for. In the 1980s, I worked in the furnace room at the seat of the local Communist Party. I used to listen to Radio Free Europe during work, I heard about Solidarity and martial law in Poland and they compared Czechoslovak and Polish people. They were very disdainful about Czechoslovak citizens, calling them an indifferent and cowardly nation. We wanted to show the radio hosts that there are some who have the courage to stand up to the regime. First of all, we wanted to be armed. We robbed the seat of the Communist Army Youth Organization. We took everything – shotguns, pistols, and about 6,000 bullets. I didn’t want to fire, I wanted the psychological effect. There were four of us in our resistance group. Me, two of my friends, and one woman. She was a friend, we could trust her, we shared the same political opinions. Close your eyes and try to imagine her. I’m not good with faces. She used to be my lover... - Short or long hair? - Medium length, I’d say. - Thick hair or...? - Average. Friend, lover, our silent connection – inconspicuous. - Narrow or wide nose? - Straight and narrow. She knew about the guns, she used to come shooting with us. She was a better shooter than me. - Eyes? Narrow? Big? I really can't remember. Her smile? Ordinary, average... I have her smile in my mind. In the style of Mona Lisa. With you I seek day in the night... We made a bomb with real explosives but we made sure it wouldn’t explode. My girlfriend was helping us, she wrapped it in its box. It was supposed to be only a warning. Wrap it, write the address, mail it. Who was it for? For an addressee... But who was it for? With Parcel Service. Head Secretary of the District CP Office in Poprad. Push a bit harder! We decided to do something big. Assassinate the Communist President Gustáv Husák. Top Party leaders came to the Tatras and stayed in their hunting mansion. We wanted to hide the bombs under the driveway and blow them up when the President would be passing there. We have to fight against the regime. By real action. Even little David can cause trouble to Goliath. For our plot, we needed a connection with the Secret Service of a capitalist country. We decided to go on a fake honeymoon. My girlfriend got us all the visas and travel permits. So boys, 28 years ago, at this same bar, I started my mission. As soon as we arrived, I went to a post office and sent a telegram to Radio Free Europe telling them that I’ll be waiting in Rovinj to discuss our common cause, I’ll be at "K" bar near the bank. I'll be the one in the blue Gold Fassl Pils shirt. I waited every evening, for ten days. Nobody showed up and I was asking myself – why? I started thinking about emigration. Since nobody came, I’d pack my bags and go. We spent two nights discussing it with my girlfriend but she didn’t want to leave. If she would’ve said yes back then, I would’ve emigrated. It felt as if I were returning to a cemetery – the arrogant Czechoslovak border guards with their guns and dogs, it was like entering prison. Sorry to disturb you, I only have a small favor to ask. Jarka works abroad now and I was wondering if you could give me her phone number. I am really very sorry but this story is finished for you. She doesn't want to meet you. I have something important to tell her. - I don’t mean any harm... - I am really sorry. Well, that’s too bad, all right then, thank you. When I got back home Jarmila and I broke up. This is what I thought: If they found out about me, and I saw policemen outside my door I’d get dressed, grab my gun, jump out through the window, and run as fast as possible, over to Poland. But my arrest came in a very different manner. It wasn’t at home, or at work, but in town. I was walking across the square when four guys jumped at me saying – Fero, let’s go have a beer, and they surrounded me. I was sentenced to 14 years. I was released from jail after the Revolution. How did I get married? I was an older man, at 33, and I wanted a home. - The bed’s fine. - You’ve made your bed and you have to lie in it. My name is Vladimír Hučín and I come from the Czech town Přerov. I was arrested four times during the Communist regime. In 1971, for disturbing a National CP Meeting, in 1976, for an armed attack at the elections and a plot to use hand grenades against Dean Reed, the Communist celebrity singer, in 1983 for a bomb attack on a Secret Service agent, incitement, distribution of anti-Soviet pamphlets, and illegal possession of arms. I’m divorced because my wife couldn’t trust me that I wouldn’t be arrested again. This audition is to select one of you who could carry out the same acts of resistance as I did during Communism. It’s going to be tough and it’s up to you if you can handle it. What is it that bothers you about the current system? Hypocrisy among people... Dishonesty... Indifference... There is no sense of solidarity among people. The fear... The neo-Nazis... - Why did you come to this audition? - I want to be able to defend myself if they got me. They attack me just for the way I look, when they don’t even know me. Could you go as far as using a gun? A gun... To use a gun to kill somebody? I’m not sure. I think so. Only a very few people can know about it. Ideally none at all. Within your circle of friends, you’ll have to come up with a convincing story about why you don’t go out as often anymore. You’ll have to lie to your boyfriend, to your parents. Are you ready for that? I think so. - Where’s the guarantee that it will stay between us? - Right now you probably can’t trust me... That takes time... In 1971, when I was 18, I went for a walk with my dog not far from here, and the People’s Militia had their exercise here as part of some Communist program. They were destroying a statue of St. Sebastian, shooting it into pieces then they pulled it down with a rope. They were all drunk. They finished by pissing all over it. When I saw all that, I felt such aversion that I went for a gun. You press here, and then pull it back again. This is the spine and you see – it’s destroyed, he’s dead. Some wounds aren’t fatal but they cause strong bleeding, so he’s finished. Watch your shoulders, and focus. He wants to kill me – sit on my head and pick my brains. You can't be scared – you have to overcome your fear. You can learn it. It’s a creature that was never liked. He has a bad name. - Please don’t kill me! And so do I – so I guess we’ve found each other. You can close your eyes if it helps. Lift your hand, slowly. Give him this. Good. He made contact with you. It’s okay, you can touch him. I think you could have him sit on your shoulder in a week’s time. In real action, you’ll need drag. - Do it yourself. - I can’t see. - Do you like me? - Not bad, actually. Only if I were younger... I used to have long hair, when I was 16-17 years old. Things did not go well for me. Once, I happened to walk into a restaurant where they celebrated 50 years of the CP. I was wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. So they beat me up, tore my hair out, they smashed my face, broke my teeth, they wanted to shove my head down the toilet. That’s how I learned what the Communist Party and their methods were like and I got involved in resistance. - The same stuff goes on today. - No way is it the same now. There’s no comparison. Things I see in schools when I give talks, the way young people dare to behave... People in the street stare at me as if I came from a different planet, and say - "What’s wrong with these kids today?" But that’s just one person’s opinion, they can’t put you in jail or anything... They wanted to beat me up just for my look. But that’s not the state authorities! - I’m scared... - Don’t be. Support the gun and hold it tight, hold it in your hand. Press it into your shoulder. - Does it kick much? - No it doesn’t. Aim, breathe, and while you exhale, try to adjust the sights to your target. - I’m afraid. - Don’t be. - Why are we shooting those busts? - They are figures of Communist ideology. They have symbolic meaning. Today, it’s busts, tomorrow it will be something else. You’ll see for yourself. Excellent! Go, go, go – keep up the pace. Think of the muscle you’re flexing. Keep going, until it starts aching. Don’t wiggle, pull, focus on the muscles in your abdomen. I can’t anymore. Now the main theme for the display – this goes on top, these are the People’s Militia, next we use photodocumentation - take this photo from Přerov. And of course let’s not forget Leninism. We use the carbon chloride chemical formula, we add this in the right measure. When we apply mechanical pressure, a blow or friction, you get the reaction! Because I was unjustly convicted in 1971, I decided to work against the regime and after I saw what they’re capable of... I was destroying their symbols by explosives. - Try if it still tastes acidic... - It does. - Okay, we’ll rinse it again. We wanted to crash their ideology in any way possible. They made their pin boards more and more durable, so we needed to use stronger explosives. This is a very dangerous explosive, it’s used for very dangerous, powerful bombs. In the course of my career, I destroyed 41 such display cabinets. One has to be prepared for many things. One thing is to be ready to commit those acts another is to be prepared to do time behind the bars. There is no luxury, a jail is a jail. The worst thing is that it goes on for years. That’s no joke. - The sausage is pretty gross. - At least it’s protein! It’s better than in jail. Sometimes you don’t have time to eat it, you’re stressed, have no appetite, there are others bullying you... All you care about is how to get it in you, you have to eat. - Your wife doesn’t cook? - I’m divorced. - How come? - Everybody knows. - Not me. - That’s not my fault. - What happened? - She couldn’t stand that I was always in jail. I was locked up four times! She would’ve stayed if she really loved you! I initiated the divorce. I had enough of causing trouble to someone else. It affects the whole family – the house searches, the mental drain of it – being surrounded by the police and special squads. So ... just live alone whole life? In my situation – which is extreme, it’s the best way. And you? What if you meet someone you like and you’ll have to lead a double life. You date him and then have to explain where you’re spending your time. This is still only a game but once it’s for real, it will be different. You don’t feel like eating anymore, I see. So what do you say? Is your motivation for what we’re doing strong enough to keep you going? Speak! Yes. Keep it slow. Don’t use your legs, it’s all in the arms. - I’m done... - One more. And the last one – don’t let your legs hang or you’ll fall. Do it! Give me one more! Slowly... Good. In the early 1970s, I used to relase such balloons filled with thousand of anti-Soviet pamphlets. They covered the whole town. - What kind of gas is this? - Helium. It’s safe. - That’s what gives you the funny voice. - Yes, that’s the one. - Can I take a puff? - You want to try it? Go ahead! What’s on the posters? Inhale deeper! What’s on those posters? Down with Soviet dictatorship! This is a serious matter. Is that a current affair? Not anymore but we still have to watch out for them. - What’s the point? - It’s not pointless! - Do you feel like a hero? - No one thanks the heroes. - But do you feel like one? - Not anymore. - You did before? - I felt like I did something good. - Because? - Because I did something at least. I didn’t just sit at home waiting to see what will happen. You have to fight for democracy and freedom. It doesn’t come for free. You can let it go. - You think it’s still burning? - Yes, it is. - You should leave only your underwear on. - I can roll it up but I won’t strip down. When you’re in front of the specialists, they’ll make you take your clothes off. - What’s the problem? We need to try this. - I don’t know... I just don’t like the idea. Fine... Roll up your shirt. - Is this enough? - We’ll see. Lift your arms. Look, you cannot be afraid. I’ve been on the lie detector 11 times and I know from experience that it can be fooled. Keep your breathing regular. - Were you born in Krnov? - Yes. - Do you have a boyfriend? - No. Do you know anyone who disagrees with the political system? – I do. Wrap it around, through here. My arm is thicker than yours. A little more and wind it. Let me, my hand is stronger. - Is your name Vladimír Hučin? - Yes. - Do you live in Přerov? - I do. - Have you ever been a member of the Communist party? - No. - Have you ever killed someone? Could we skip this question? - Could you sacrifice your accomplice? - I could. - Are you training someone in subversive activities? - I am. - Is it a man or a woman? - A woman. - Do you love her? - No. How do you feel right now? Are you happy? - Can you describe the way you feel now? - I have mixed feelings. - What kind? - This is not the place to discuss them. Speak. Be specific. - Is there anything worrying you? - Stop prying! How much longer do you think you could take it? I don’t know. - Slower? - Something like that. Keep going, don’t care about me. You lead, you’re the bass, I follow. OUR DREAM IS TO SEE YOU HAPPY. Excellent, perfect. Now everybody smile! Are you a happy family? Yes or no? Right now, yes. You know how to pull the trigger, this is the security latch, it moves back and forth. You can use both hands if you like, in sport shooting they do it single-handedly. Now release the safety button. Try with one arm, plant your feet... - Wait, you need ear-plugs. - Give me some then. Release the security latch – but don’t turn the gun! Don’t turn it around like your wooden spoon in the pot. Handling the wooden spoon also takes practice! This is my vision of perfect date... I’d take my girlfriend to the pond, at sunset, I would put explosives in the water without her knowing about it, then I’d blow it up. It would scare her and she’d flung herself into my arms. Don’t worry, it wasn’t that big. A nice date on the lake...
