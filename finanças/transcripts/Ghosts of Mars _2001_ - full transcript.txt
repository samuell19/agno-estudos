Rumours have spread across Mars from outposts to towns. Something buried for centuries has been uncovered. As this force moves across the south valley... ...it leaves only silence and death. Take your seats, please. The Cartel thinks the rumours are out of control. They'd like to make a statement in two hours. We've had another incident. At 1520 yesterday a freight train, Trans Marineris 74 Yankee... ...returned from the southern valley on auto pilot. Get to your security stations now! Okay, let's move! Initial reports indicated it was a ghost train. It appeared no one was aboard until a survivor was discovered. Call for Med-Tech backup. Lieutenant Melanie Ballard. Second officer for a squad of escort police... ...transferring a prisoner from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine to here. Ballard was taken to hospital under guard. She had superficial wounds but was in good condition. However, the illegal substance tetromonochloride was in her system. Everything will be all right. Take it easy. Bring her in. Lieutenant Ballard, please be seated. Do I get a lawyer, or don't police officers have rights? Representation by counsel won't be necessary. Your rights are protected by the Matronage. You can speak freely. - Then I'm not being charged? - Sit down. This is a discovery hearing. As ranking officer, your After Action Report is required. Where's your team? The prisoner? What happened at Shining Canyon? Last Friday at 1750, we were slamming through a dust storm... ...on the edge of the southern valley. 74 Yankee was an ore hauler for the mines in the outer sector. We were hitching a ride into Shining Canyon. You beat me. - You've played Tarts before. - Never. Let's spin them again. One down and one up. Fuck me, the Five of Bats. You've got the Wheel. Your wager? Five bucks. Helena. Sorry. They've tracked a storm across the south and we're right under it. What's the mark? 3200 klicks. We should be there by 1800. So just let me know if you need anything. Melanie! You high? Fuck, it's just Clear. Be straight long before we hit the canyon. You better be. This is no sleepwalk. We're picking up James Williams. "Desolation" Williams? Cooling his heels in the Shining Canyon jail. Deep solitary. - What's the charge this time? - Murder. That's the third time. He always gets off on self-defence. Sounds like he finally went psycho. Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated. He shows up at the mine with a bizarre story. Sends three officers to the medevac before he's locked down. You see the picture? It's you, me, this new guy, Jericho, and some rookies. What do you think of Sergeant Jericho? I hoped we'd get a good, solid woman to count on. I don't know. I guess we'll see. Well... I need you straight, Melanie. Don't worry about that, commander. I'm as straight as they come. Such a shame. Check our transfer schedule. Shining Canyon. Shining Canyon, this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee. - They ready for us? - With the storm, I can't get through. Your coffee, Mr. McSimms. Three sugars, two whites. - You want some? - No, thanks. HOW long? About 40. Shining Canyon? ETA, 40 minutes. Check your equipment. I don't want surprises. Everything all right? I noticed that charming scene with the Queen Bee. You know how the service is. To make captain, I'll have to pay the price. I don't care about wearing another bar. Yeah, it could be that. Or maybe she has good taste in women. Sergeant, you are seriously out of line. I'd hate to spoil my record. All right! I know you think you're pretty tough hombres. You have the best training and the best gear. You probably think this is a routine transfer. There's nothing routine about this prisoner. We are here for James "Desolation" Williams. I want you jack-ready and double-tough. Officers, you can disembark here. When's departure? We'll need a half-hour. We got a four-hour turnaround and we're due back here at... ...2200. Report anytime after that. Try to raise the yard master. Ed? Ed, you out there? Rookies, use breathers. We won't have air like Earth for 10 years. Let's go. - God, I hate this thing. - You'll get used to it. Two years ago we were wearing full-face breathers. Takes a month to get over the headaches out here. So this is Shining Canyon? God, what a dump. - First time in the boonies? - Standard layout. A boomtown like all the others. Seen one, you can go home. It's cold, and they don't tell you a one-year contract here... ...equals two years Earth time. Gotta read the fine print. Where is everybody? Friday night, the place should be packed. Twelve hours to sunup with money to burn... ...whores to fuck and drugs to take. Instead we got a graveyard. Maybe they're inside spending their money. I'll get us in at the RecFac. You and Jericho check in at the jail. Save some hot water for me. Where were you before Chryse? Utopia. The arse end of the universe. A penal camp full of work-amnesty cutthroats. Sounds nasty. But you seem to be holding together. What you see is nothing. I have numerous hidden talents. Need help with that? You're persistent, aren't you? I've changed a few minds in my time. Not many of us breeders around. I'd hate to miss a chance. What do you say? Hello! Anybody here? Officer to front desk. Well, hello, Mr. Williams. No one's about. What do you think? I don't know. Should I pop the lock and go in? "Pop" a level-eight security door? I got a way with locks and mechanical objects. Every machine on Mars loves me. Let's check with the commander first. So, what do you do for fun? - Are you a gambler? - No, I'm short-time. I believe in saving my money. Don't worry about that. I was gonna do it for free. I'll put it this way. Maybe I would if you were the last man on Earth. But we're not on Earth. A voltage overload, most likely. You wanna check it out? It's probably nothing. But, on second thought... Police officer. Anybody there? Oh, Shit! Jeﬂcho! - This isn't making me happy. - Let's get backup. Jesus Christ! What are you doing? I almost killed you. - What's going on? - RecFac's a slaughterhouse. What? "Slaughterhouse"? That's the word Descanso used. I didn't see it myself. Braddock told me right after we arrived... ...she and the rookies headed to the recreation facility. I'll get us in at the RecFac. You and Jericho check in at the jail. Save some hot water for me. Descanso, sweep left. Bashira, stick with me. Bashka! Bashka! Officer to train, do you read? Casino, barracks, dining hall. No one alive anywhere. Commander? What? I can't reach the train. Keep trying. How we doing? This was built to stay locked. Williams is still locked up? What do you mean? He was arrested for murdering six workers and a courier... ...at the Hub Station. They were hung and decapitated, just like those in the RecFac. - How did they pin that on him? - He showed up with their payroll. The cashier realised it was stolen scrip. There's gotta be a day log here somewhere. Sergeant's desk. Here. Last night the mine called in a work stoppage. Reported winds up to 60 knots. -60? - That's what it says. Anything else? Arrest for theft... Then nothing. Got it. What's going on? We haven't had a meal or a piss break in hours. Descanso, open the door. Answer "here" when I call you. - Akooshay. - What? Answer "here." - Zimmerman. - Right in front of you. Benchley. Who's that? Showed up last night. Checked herself in. Insisted on being locked up with us. Wake her up, sunshine. Let's see what she has to say. Hey! Somebody wants to talk to you. - Who are you? - Whitlock. What are you doing in here? It's the only safe place, okay? - Can I go back to sleep? - No. I need answers. What's going on out there? What's your ID? Dr. Arlene Whitlock. I'm the Spec Six Science Officer for the mine at Drucker's Ridge. I left there a week ago in a weather balloon I modified. There was a disturbance in town. Seemed prudent to get out. They said there was a riot, the place destroyed. Something like that. I was adrift for several days. Ran out of food. I followed the rail road tracks until I got here. Ah, Shit! Then the storm forced me too low. I hit a windmill and crashed. They were kind enough to take me in. Wasn't that nice of them. Mel, Jericho... ...go check out Williams. See if he knows anything. Williams? You know what's going on outside? Are you aware of what's going on outside? Let's go. This asshole doesn't know anything either. You got balls saying that. That's Desolation Williams. He took out six when they cornered him at Deimos. Yeah, and this is eight inches. You men love to exaggerate. Goes with the territory. In my case, it's a bit different. A connoisseur like yourself might appreciate what I have. Go get the commander. Disarm her. Officer! It was almost like she was... .”possessed. Like a force was inside her. Who was she? She was a dispatch officer. We tried to make her comfortable. The rookies took her to a storage room. Then the commander and I went to look around. - What do you think? - The Science Officer's lying. - Tell me about Williams. - I didn't read the full file. - Said he didn't kill anybody. - They just died of fright. Then out their own heads off? Put down your weapon! Put it down! Call Jericho. We need backup! We're 20 southwest of the Red: ac. Don't open the door! Don't let it out! Who goes there? Can't fight it! It's in me! Commander Braddock! There's a man in there. Open it. We'll need a cutting torch. - How long? - At least half an hour, maybe more. What's going on here? He committed suicide. But before he did, he yelled something like: "Stay away!" "Don't open the door." "Stay away-" And now the commander's gone. Helena! Maybe he was contagious. Or crazy, I don't know. I say we leave him locked in. Look, one of us has to stay with the rookies. You go back to the jail, I'll find the commander. Let's get the hell out of here. There's nothing we can do for him. You're right. Okay, let's go. Drop your weapon, or I'll cut her head off! What happened? She let him out for food. And you unshackled him. What do you want? To get out of here! Okay. We'll let you walk, just let the girl go. Think I'm falling for that shit? I can't let you take her. Take me. Okay? Put the gun down! Put them down! Drop your gun, Descanso. Yeah, drop the gun. Okay- Relax! Take it easy. Relax! Relax. You'll get what you want. I know I'll get everything I want. Let's go. Damn, girl. I like you already. Shit. You Okay? Just swell. Where's Williams? He went out the airlock. He ran into the clinic not two minutes ago. - I guess he got your shotgun. - He was too fast. He's still in there. You two take the back door. I'll go in the front. If he comes at you, shoot to kill. Hey. Now what? How the hell did that happen? - Let's go. - Wait a minute. You're coming with me now. You see what's going on. You know I didn't kill nobody. Move it. I ain't going nowhere. I saved your life! You should let me go. And I saved yours. We're even. Now move it! Let me ask you something. You're so innocent, how come we found stolen flash on you? I didn't say I was innocent. I Said I didn't kill nobody. Let's say I believe you. What exactly happened at K-305? I don't know. I was just changing trains from Camp Sinai. Had time to get me something to eat. So I went into the station. It was lying there, so you took it. You would have done the same thing. See, that's where you're wrong. I'm a cop, not a crook. It's a thin line between a cop and a crook these days. You think it's a big difference between us? You just got the Woman behind your bullshit. Look at you. You look high right now. You know I saved your life out there. So why don't you save mine, and let me out? Look... ...my job is to bring you back to stand trial. I don't think you did it. But that's not my call. So let's not make this more complicated. It'll be real complicated. Believe that shit. I ain't going back! So you secured your prisoner. Where was your commanding officer? I can only report what Sgt. Jericho told me later. After the man committed suicide, he went looking for her. Let's get the hell out of here. There's nothing we can do for him. You're right. Let's go. Commander Braddock! Lieutenant. We got a situation here. You're breaking up. I can hardly hear you. The commander's dead. Everybody's gone insane. Jericho, can you read? Jeﬂcho! Come on, let us out. Start at the beginning! - I told you I got here last night. - Don't bullshit me! Okay- What the hell is going on out there? What? In Earth's semi-arid regions... ...certain organisms live in pools formed by the annual rains. When the pools dry up, they can't live but they don't die. They go dormant. Below the surface, away from the hot sun... ...until the next rain cycle begins. Then they reemerge. - I think that's happening here. - I don't understand. Whatever used to live here, we woke it up. It takes us, okay? It's a kind of possession. Sgt. Jericho's on the radio. He's found three people. They're on the way with an ETA of 5 minutes. You should talk to him. - What? Three people? - That's what he said. - You okay? - No. Is something broken? No, I'm all right. But it's out of the body now. Yeah, it's loose in here. Lieutenant, sergeant's on the radio. We're coming in. Can you read me? Where are you? We're right down the street. We? Who's "we"? I found three people alive. Open the door for us. I tried to reach you on the radio. Make sure that door is looked. There must be 200 of those freaks looking to kick our ass. Okay. Relax. Who are these guys? I found them in the mine shed. Lieutenant, we got a situation here. You're breaking up. I can hardly hear you. The commander's dead. Everybody in the mine's gone insane. Check the window! They didn't see. Who are you? Who are we? Who are you? The man asked you a question. I'm Jericho. He's not one of them. What's happening? Who are those clowns? What are they so sparked up about? Used to be miners. Then everybody lost their mind... ...running around, chopping people's heads off. Ease up, man. We were on the rim when the work stopped. - What are they doing? - I don't know. They're knocking off early for the night. How are we gonna sneak in? Shut up! What the hell is that? Let's get the hell out of here. We hid until the storm was over. Later, I went out to take a look around. Thought they were all dead. Then some of them started to come to. They walked around like they were confused or lost. A few of them seemed okay. They tried to help the others. - Then they started changing. - What do you mean? They act different, stand different. Start cutting themselves for decoration. Filed their teeth. Made weapons. Killed ones who hadn't changed. Cut people's faces off... ...and wore them for masks. You lads got any weapons? - I mean real weapons. - Only cops can have guns. Some detonators in them cases. Do you know how they work? I know you need dynamite. We take our prisoner and we all get on the train. - Who would that be? - That's not your concern. If it's Desolation Williams... ...it concerns me a lot. Drop your weapon. All of you! Weapons on the floor. 80 only cops have guns? You fucking pricks. We lied. Now go get Williams. I don't think so. What was that? Fucking kill me. No problem. Will you two stop fucking about? Lieutenant, let Williams out. Give me one reason. I gave you about 200 reasons. They're outside. Williams doesn't matter, and neither do these scumbags. What matters is that we stick together to get out of here. All of us... ...including Williams... ...including them. Who are you calling scumbag, motherfucker? Now quit stalling and take us to Williams! I'll be goddamned. Finally. Man, this town done went crazy. We had to improvise. You like it? I love it. I want you to let him out. What's up, D? I'm still shackled. You pigs on a fucking break? Free him up! I knew you'd let me go. - Long time. - I didn't think you could do it. Piece of cake. It was my plan, Desolation. Fuck! - You didn't watch the door? - I was! - Open this door. - I don't think so. Open that door, or I'll blow your head off. Then you'll never get out. Someone will find you tied upside down with your heads out off. Call your dogs off so we can talk. Put them down. Put it down. Listen to me, Williams. We don't have a lot of time. You need us and we need you. None of us will survive if we don't stick together. Give me your word that if I open this door... ...you and your boys will stand by my command at all times. I never give my word. It's okay. I never make deals with criminals. You got it. What? You're making deals with cops? And you are too. Give her your weapon. Everybody, give it up. Well, introduce us. These are my compadres. Uno, Dos and Tres. Uno must be the nice one. You got that right, butchy. I'm not as nice as Desolation and I'll cut your titties off-- Who's in charge here? Let go of my arm. - Who is in charge here? - You! You! Shit! You just gonna watch? Yeah, and now that you're done mopping the floor, get me a beer. What's next? We get more deputies. You're deputised. Consider this a martial law situation. Let's go. When did this start? It started a few minutes ago. - What should we do? - We can't take him. Then here he stays. Guys, what is that? It's a Laffer, a black-market breather. - It has a 15-percent nitrous mix. - It gets you high? Turns your brain to Swiss cheese. - One gross of detonators. - What are they good for? Some dynamite would help, but they make a good bang. We could put them in cans to make hand grenades. All right, you got 10 minutes. Easy. Here, let me do it. That's beautiful! That's what you get. You gonna be okay to do this? It's almost 2200 hours. The plan is short and simple. Descanso and Jericho lead, we all follow. It's 50 metres. Bashira and I are in the rear. Any questions? Put your hand down. All clear. Let's do it! Hey, bro, I don't see no motherfucking train. Hey, lady... ...we don't see no train. It'll be here. Come on, let's go! That's the mine office! - What are they doing? - Tearing the whole town apart. Come on, pick it up! Lieutenant! Hold your fire. Keep on moving. Go! - Where's the train? - I don't know. You don't know? What's that mean? Ballard, to the train. Plan A is fucked up. What's plan B? Yeah, it's the same as plan A. You got any fresh ideas? Yeah, what we should have done in the first place. Shit! Come on, you mindless motherfuckers! - Twice I've saved your life. - Run a tab. Jericho, grenade! Come on, man, on your feet. Let's move! Shit. Open that door! We sealed the doors and Jericho dismantled the lock. They couldn't open it from outside, so we were safe... ...for a while. Try to reach the train on the radio. Where's your brother? He didn't make it. Oh, God. Uno was your brother? Yeah. Look at him. Whatever's inside waited a long time to get out. I didn't understand how they move. It's the wind. Yeah, the wind takes them. Once the host dies, they drift along from town to town, human to human. What a perfect creation. Vengeance on anything that lays claim to their planet. What did you see at Drucker's Ridge? I was at the mine when they called a work stoppage. There was a section 740, a scientifically significant find. A 740 could be many things: A biological organism, signs of water, things like that. We dynamited and discovered an entrance. It was a tunnel carved into the rock. It had been hidden for centuries and someone... ...other than man, had carved it. Jesus! - What the hell is that? - I don't know. Get the hell out of here! It was me. I opened Pandora's box. I let them out. I found the train. It's three klicks north of town. The tracks are blocked. - Can they get through? - They're working on it. - You okay? - Yes. - Barricaded the rear door. - Good. There's a courtyard with a wall out back. There's even a Rover. Maybe we can make a run for it. No, we wait. The train's coming back for us. If a train's coming, they better hurry up. You did good out there. Yeah, right. It's a fucked-up situation. I never trust cops, but you did okay. You trust me? Hell, no. I really don't understand you. - Nobody cares about me but me. - Doesn't that bother you? Nothing bothers me. I stopped worrying long ago. Don't you believe in anything? I believe in staying alive. Yeah, but for what? Stick around, I might let you know. When? When the tide is high and the water's rising. Doing okay in here? Mel. Check this out. What about it? It's pretty solid. One way in, and a back door to the rear entrance. A good, sturdy door. What's your point? It's rather cosy, don't you think? I don't believe this. You lured me here to seduce me? Well, the way things are going... ...I thought this might be our last chance... ...to dance. Yeah. Fuck him, whatever the fuck he is. It's out of him. EVer)/one go' NOW! I Let's take her out back. What do you mean? We ain't moving her anywhere. It's taken her over. There's nothing we can do. Easy, man, I lost a brother in this. That's not her. Come on. Let's put her down, before they hear us. This belongs to her. - Where did you get it? - Stole it. Do you know what it is? It's her stash. This will mess with anything in there. Bon voyage, Mel. Let's get the hell back in here. No... ...I will not! I was aware of having... ...thoughts... ...or memories. Like I'd been invaded by something, and it was trying to take me over. Something wouldn't let that thing take over. I didn't know where I was. Then it hit me. I was outside, alone... ...unarmed. The back wall's been breached. Don't worry, the back door's secured. Let me in! It's me! It's Melanie! Open the door! Looks like her to me. Haven't heard any of them speak English. The tide's high out here! Give me those keys. Come on! IS it you? Yes. It's me. I had a glimpse of the Martians... ...of their minds, of what they want. They want the destruction of any invading species. The way they see it, we're the invaders. Something's kicking out there. They made a battering ram. Go to the rear of the jail. Bashira, take Jericho, you're the second line of defence. - So we stay here? - We hold them off as long as we can. When we kill one, what's inside will come after us. I know. So if one of us gets possessed... Leave them. Here we go. Party time! - I'm out. - I'm out. - Move! Move! - Clear! Clear! Stand clear! - Clear! - Get out! - I got it! - Take them out back. Better get out of here. Get back. Come on! Come on! Come on, let's go! Look for the train. Get this thing started. Unlock the gate! Come on, hurry up! The train's there. Train, do you read? - Where were you? - Where were you? Bashira, come down! Wait for us. We're on our way. Let's go! Come on! Get in! Get ready! Oh, m'!- Come on! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Okay, go! Go! - What happened to you? - We got trapped. I'll get us out. We've gotta go back. Slow down outside of town, then come to a stop. No way. - I'm giving you an order. - The answer's no. The answer's yes! Look, even if we get back to Chryse... ...those things will just keep coming. We've got a chance here... ...a chance to stop this thing. This is about one thing: Dominion. It's not their planet anymore. What about him? Isn't our job to take him back? Is he a prisoner, or is he one of us? I can give a damn about saving this planet. It's been after me since the day I was born. If I die, I'm gonna die fighting... ...not running. Hey, Whitlock, if we blew up the nuclear power station... ...we'd have a huge explosion, right? Not unless we move the rods to expose the core. Then what? You'd have a small atomic bomb, going "boom." How small? It'd blow out a radius of a mile, maybe two. Would it kill them? It'd destroy their human hosts, but as for them... Hell, I don't know. Jericho, can you get us in? I can try. The plan was simple. Jericho, Whitlock and I headed towards the power plant. The others backed the train into the station. They would distract the Martians as we set the charges in the plant. Then they'd pick us up, and we'd get as far away as possible. Like I said, it was a simple plan. It just didn't work out. How you doing? - I'm working on it. - Hurry up. - I'll remove the containment shell. - Where do I put the dynamite? Officer to the train, they spotted us. Get back here! Yeah? Let's go! The blast radius could be up to two miles. - What's that mean? - Step on it! Keep it full throttle. - What are you gonna do? - Lighten our load. There's more dynamite in the back. Williams? See you later, motherfucker! You Okay? Say YOU!' prayers. I didn't know it was this deep. Should have done this hours ago. You do that like a pro. Yeah. Me and my brother have been through lots of battles... ...ever since we was kids. I never thought I'd go to war with someone like you. I know you'll tell those people that I helped you... ...and I wasn't the cause of this mess here. They're looking for someone to blame. I swear to you, as soon as I get back... ...I'll tell them all about this fucked-up planet. They'll drop the charges when they get the report. Okay- That ought to hold it. When you get back, have someone check it. I couldn't get it perfect, so it might scar. - I'm getting a collection. - You'll be all right. - Comfortable? - Yeah. I'll get you a blanket. What the hell are you doing? - This is where I get off. - What are you talking about? We'll be in Chryse soon. Can't let you turn me in. I can't let you walk! What are you going to do? Fucking shoot me? There's nowhere to run. Anywhere is better than hell. Catch you later. Yeah, right. Shit. What happened to Williams? I don't know. When I woke up, he was gone. And you were handcuffed? He must have done it while I slept. By then, I trusted him. That's all you have to say? That's all I know. Lt. Ballard, I suggest you get some rest. You're dismissed. Is our statement going to be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts? Attention all police... ...report to your nearest station for weapon assignment. A security breach has occurred. This is a level 10 emergency. Police personnel, report to your division for assignment. All civilians evacuate the streets immediately. Please remain indoors until further instructed. Come on! Tide is up. Time to stay alive. If you ever switch sides, you'd be a hell of a crook. You'd make a hell of a cop. - Let's just kick some ass. - It's what we do best.
