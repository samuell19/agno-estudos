When hunting, it is important to keep in mind the ten most common deer hunting mistakes. Number one, staying in the same stand all day. Deers moves between bedding areas and their food source. You know what? Don't worry about the mistakes right now. We can get into that later. Hey, faggot. Fuck head. The goal is to be the best hunter you can. If you just want to go out and hunt a couple of small bucks, or randomly shoot small birds, rabbits and squirrels, at the end of the day, you're out there to have fun. If you're not having fun, you shouldn't do it. And never make an excuse for what you shoot. Reagan was here. We've got fresh wood. Man, Reagan is so reliable. It's really good to be here, Dan. Little brother, did you know that Big Bear is located in San Bernardino County, the largest county in the United States, approximately the size of West Virginia. Wow. You're just full of fun facts now, aren't ya? I don't know why Dad kept this place. The upkeep is horrendous. He sunk every last penny he had into this cabin. Well, technically, it's a lodge. Yeah. Campbell Lodge. 100 years old. A stopover point on the old Highway 38 for hunters and sports enthusiasts. Hunting was like church to Dad. Ironic, considering that allegedly this was a house of ill repute. You got the guns? Yeah, I'm right here. You're... - You're over there. - Oh. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Why are we doing this? This is... this is what we do. We meet once a year for a week. We get drunk. We hunt some big bucks. We grill some tender deer shanks, go to the sweat lodge, talk about our women. Why? There is no sweat lodge. Ah, we're gonna build one. I don't understand why we can't do normal shit that normal brothers do, like... go on cruises and attend high-end spas. Because we're men, we do manly things. Oh, that's right. Like hunt and screw women. Yeah. Not necessarily in that order. I mean, what's wrong with that? Nothing. I've just been... Doing a lot of thinking, that's all. I just don't want to... Turn out to be some fucked up version of Dad. Enough talking, let's go scout. You got the ammo? Yeah, it's in my bag. Why are you avoiding my question? Ah... Well, brother, um... because I don't want to deal with some bullshit interpretations of a therapist - who doesn't know shit about... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How do you know about that? - Mom told me. - Mom told you? Well, she shouldn't have done that. Why not? I mean, isn't this what we do? Reveal ourselves? I mean, why wouldn't you? I was going to tell you. I was. As soon as we... got here so we could talk in person. Well, now you told me. - Let's go scout. - Right now? Seriously, can I just, like, relax for a half an hour? We're up 7,000 feet. We have to acclimate, man. Do I have a pussy for a brother? - Yeah, that's it. - Ugh. Come on. This is what we do, what we've waited all year to do. First day scouting, get the lay of the land. Do some tracking. Come on, Freud. Get that big dick in gear. You know, our younger brother might be stopping by. - Baby bro? - Yeah. - He hates hunting. - I know, but I think he has something he wants to talk to us about. Oh, well, it better be about that pro soccer league he's gonna sign with. I don't think this is about soccer. Well, uh, I mean, why wouldn't it be? He... He said he had a few more good years left. I know, but... It's, like, the tone in his voice. I'll see you outside. Ugh. "Tone in his voice?" I just... I hope this therapy thing doesn't fuck you up. Oh, that reminds me. My therapist thought it would be really great if you and I could go in together. - You and me? - Yeah. For a joint session. That will never fucking happen. Come on, let's go check the camps. But... we're taking the ATV's. No, those fuckers make too much noise. Let's just walk. Ah, yes. Okay. - You got it? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna sort of... go on down here. Got it. Got it. There you go. Look at that later. - Sit here? - Yeah. Looks like a good spot. Let me ask ya something. Yeah. Why was Dad so hard on us? He could be a son of a bitch if you didn't do the right thing. He'd beat us. It was only his belt. It hurt like hell, it was medieval. - Pussy. - Cock sucker. - Ass rimmer. - Cum gulper. - Animal humper. - Wife beater. That's not funny. Fair enough. Look... every time we got knocked down, Dad was always there to help us up. And he almost always made all our games. And if he didn't, Uncle Richie was there. You know what? Let's go check the camps. Okay... Come on, let's go. Hey, you hear that? Yeah, it's like sawing, like somebody's building a cabin out here. Yeah. No, I checked the Onyx app before we came down here. This is still land. There's no... There's no private building going on here... Could be poachers. Fuckin' tweakers. Maybe the weed growers. Man, I wish I had tags for all those fuckers. Whoa, whoa. There it is again. Who would be building out here in the middle of nowhere? All right. We've gotta head home. No, no, no. We're gonna find out who those fuckers are. - Okay. Yeah. We can do that. - All right, let's do it. Holy shit. That's a big fucking bear. - Shit. That's a grizzly. - That's impossible, they're extinct in California. No. Brother, I've heard the stories. One hunter was eaten by one, all that was left was one shoe. Well, you can't shoot them. It's a felony. They're an endangered species... I'll fucking shoot her dead in self-defense. No, no, no, no. Look, look, look, look. She's leaving. She's probably going back to her cubs. Shit. All right, come on, come on. Fuck. - Fuck. - Shit, that was close. She was warning us. She was... she was protecting her cubs, man. Maybe she thought we were boars. Predators. We're hunters, not predators. It's the same fucking thing. Pedophiles are predators. They prey on the helpless and the innocent. Let's get the hell out of here. - You got it. - Okay. You weren't gonna kill that bear, were you? Another two seconds, I'd put a... bullet in her brain and drop her ten yards from us. You do realize if you killed her, her cubs would die. No. Out here, you either eat or you get eaten. - That's reality. - You also know it's a gross misdemeanor to kill big game without proper tags? You're a lawyer, you should know the law. Really? Are you an idiot? Just saying, it'd be awkward. I'd have to report you to the Game Warden. You'd betray me for a law that has nothing to do with the natural habitat? Like, last season. Remember the cougar that was stealing our kills? Yeah, it was inconvenient but it was just trying to survive. Right. "Oh, those cute little cats, they're so cuddly. We have to protect them." That cat would rip your throat out and take your insides out if you're not out there with a weapon to defend yourself. You know, I always got your back. You'd be a much better hunter if you had the killer instinct. Well, sometimes I'd rather be hurt than hurt other people. Doesn't make you much of a hunter, does it? Well, look, I gotta sit down for a second. We've always been hunters. Never questioned it. I just saw the look on Dad's face and how happy he was when we were hunting. Hey. Steven, you familiar with the story of Cain and Abel? No. Cain was a farmer. Abel was a shepherd. They both made a sacrifice to God but God preferred Abel's offering of a lamb. Cain was jealous and he killed his brother in a fit of rage. Doesn't sound like much of a happy ending now, does it? Well, the point is that the dichotomy of hunting versus agriculture goes all the way back to Adam and Eve. Abel was a nomadic herder. His needs were simple and his heart was pure. It's really not a story about two brothers quarreling as much as two different ways of life. It's... it's in our DNA, the struggle for power and dominance and the... the purity of the hunter. So, you done? Yeah. I want you to have this. You know I've always got your back, brother, don't you? I do know that, yeah. Yeah. - Can we go now? - Yeah. I'm hungry. You do love the sound of your own voice, don't you? Yes, I... I actually do. See anything. Not really. What's the not really part? I see some rabbits and squirrels and... there's a random duck. I need another drink. What's with this drinking before we hunt? We drink after we hunt. Not after the shit we went through today. - Fair enough. - Huh. What else do the, um, the SD cards show? Nothing more. There is a random cougar. I think it was the one from last year. Remember the one with the torn ear? We need to track it and kill it. Cougars are off-limits in California. You know that. It's a ridiculous law. Makes it a total clusterfuck for deer hunters in the state. Okay, well, it makes it challenging for us hunters but we've prepped for months. We got this. You need to put the cams higher in the tree... - I know. - Catch a wider radius. They can get stolen or wild animals swat them down. So... What's all this about gay spas and cruises? Is that more of the bullshit from your therapist? Oh, so therapy's bullshit now? And I didn't say "gay spas," by the way. You implied it. What's this all about? Okay, uh, my... girlfriend thought it would be a good idea. Ex-girlfriend. - Peggy, wasn't it? - Yeah. You dumped her. No, she dumped me, actually. She had some good points about our relationship, though. Couldn't have been that good if she dumped you. Well, she sai... You know, she said I was... too masculine. A man can never be too masculine. Actually, you know what she said, and I quote: "I am a bad version of myself," unquote. - What does that mean? - I have no freaking idea. Maybe that's why I got into therapy because I'm trying to figure out what the hell she meant. She also said that you are a bad influence on me. - I'm your brother. - Yeah, I know. That's what I told her. Listen, you cannot ever let a woman leave you first. If you sense she's going to leave you, you dump her ass. God, Dan you can be a really cold-hearted asshole sometimes, man. Just... listen to me, because I do not like repeating myself. You cannot ever let a woman leave you first. If she does, you know what that means? Either you've got an incredibly small penis or you're such a loser, you can't even afford a nice dinner for two at a... Even if it's only a midtown Italian joint, and provide a decent place to sleep. And I'm not talking about a Motel 6 or eight or whatever the hell it is... A Motel 6, if you recall. Do you remember we were ski instructors in Jackson Hole? Do you remember those two rich older women? They were trying to make us their boy toys. And you had too much pride. You're like, "No, we can stay wherever the hell we want to stay." We stayed in a Motel 6 that ended up being, like, a high-end Holiday Inn for like, 275 a night. Look, point being... None of those suppositions are true. You work, you have savings. Dad took care of you before he died, gave you the condo, gave me and Andrew some cash. It's almost like he knew he was dying. Do you know what I mean by that? Like he was... He was more generous the older he got, like he... felt bad for the way he treated us. Point is, you're a great catch. You're not as good a catch as me... No question. Definitely. But you're way above the norm. And your dick is in the 99th percentile... You've said that four times... So no woman should ever... and I mean ever leave you first or you are not doing your job. Little brother, I think you might be praying but could you speed it up? Because deer hunting season's gonna be over. I was blessing my food. Well, unless God has descended into a human body, I believe I sent you $300 for real food. So why don't you worship me? Oh, this looks amazing. Oh, I love eggs. I... I like my eggs yellow and runny. What is this? They're egg whites. They're better for you. This tastes like... this tastes like cardboard. 'Cause it's gluten-free bread. I'm gluten sensitive. You know that. Ugh, man... Oh. This sausage looks good. Let me try this. Oh, man, this is nasty. - What's in this? - It's plant protein. Look, I really appreciate the effort but... we're hunters. And as hunters, we eat meat. We love meat. That's the food that sustains us to go hunting again. I'm gonna go get my gear and, uh, you clean this up, 'kay? Yeah. Just gonna finish this first. All right. Get my rifle... Backpack. There he is. There's godfather buck, he's come back. Look at that rack. I know, he's a 14-pointer. Yeah, this is one for the history books, little brother. This is gonna make us legends. Take your shot. Patience. Steady. Steady. Okay. Damn. I thought I had that shot. You talkin' 'bout the granddaddy buck? We'll get him. We always do. It's godfather, and I'm not waiting another six years. Nah, he'll be dead by then. What happened to Peggy? Didn't work out. Remember, she had a pet name for your dick. Oh, yes. Felix. Felix. Felix is a fucking cat... He's a fucking cartoon character. I think it had something to do with her former boyfriend. Mm. You got a big one. Uh... And how would you know that? I've seen you naked. Camping trips, family vacations. Hey, remember that time in Mexico when we were camping on the beach and we met those two crazy Mexican chicks? Yeah, um... Yeah, but they weren't Mexican. They were from Riverside. Yeah, but they looked Mexican. 'Member how they'd just stripped off their swimsuits in two seconds flat and ran buck naked into the ocean! Yeah. And we followed them. And, God, it did feel good to go swimming in the ocean naked. Point being... I've seen you naked enough times to see that big piece of meat swinging back... Okay. Okay. Dan, jeez. I mean, this is... This is embarrassing, okay? Embarrassing? If I had that nice slab of beef, - I'd be showin' it off... - Stop... Every chance I got. - Okay... - Why stop? What... what about what you're packin'? Do you... do you satisfy your wife? Is she happy? I haven't had any complaints. What about the girlfriend? You know, the one you keep on the side. Oh, Ginger. Yeah? We have a good time. Yeah. It's not fair to Sarah. Fair is for pussies. Life is never fair. Don't you care about doing the right thing? She gives me something Sarah can't give me. You know, I don't understand you, Dan. You got a successful career. Beautiful wife who adores you. Two gorgeous kids, Stevie and Alana... Who absolutely adore you. You're definitely their favorite uncle. No, I don't need your flattery right now. I want to know why you're cheating on your wife. Because I can. That is a terrible answer. You know the law. There are consequences to your actions. The law is not fair. Innocent people are convicted every day, and there's... There's literally nothing we can do about it. Yeah, but you can uphold your own moral law. The law I practice is based on English common law. And it's a law that has more to do with protocol and justice. Because if you do one thing wrong, miss one court date, talk back to the judge, guess what? Your client goes to jail and if they have brown or black skin, what do you think's gonna happen to them... A broken system is no excuse for a lack of ethics and morals. Ah, man. Where are you going? Hey, Dad. Life is about power, little brother. Doctor delivering a baby whose very life is in his hands and he uses forceps? Parents raising a child who has to submit to their idiosyncrasies and flaws? The coach who makes you run an extra ten laps because you looked at him funny. Power is primal. The hunt. The thrill of the chase. I need that! Okay. Well, my therapist says that there's a huge difference between wants and needs. I'm a wolf in a three piece suit. I howl at the moon. I follow the scent. What is this? Some Little Red Riding Hood analogy? I'm a Neanderthal. I compete and I always win. And I do it not because I have to or I need to, but for the fun of it, the fuck it all sport of it! Wolves are like that, straight predators who kill for fun. But they also kill because they can kill and they will keep on killing as long as they can. There's no limit to the amount they can kill. And then they rest but then when they get energy, they pop out some more pups and they kill some more. And they will go eat elk and go eat deer and eat them from the asshole until they rip their insides out and the animal bleeds out and dies maybe hours, maybe days later. That's the reality of nature. You want to see it now? Do I want to see what? My dick. I am not some conquest, Dan. Women like my cock, the shape, how hard it gets. Women are not a conquest. They are for me. Just like hunting. Let me see your cock. - What? - Whip it out, brother. We're men, aren't we? It's been a long time since I've seen you naked. I want to see just how big that monster dick is. Just fucking with you, brother! Give me your glass. I know you've got a great piece of equipment. Here you go. I just... I just need to know that you're a man, not some little pussy. Because with a cock like that, I'm sure you've had a lot of offers from women and men. Look, just don't go gay on me, okay? You're fucked up, and... I want to go to bed now. These days, people don't know who they are. There's so many genders, pronouns, all that shit. I think people have a right to be who they want to be. And it's a beautiful time right now to explore identity, gender identity, belief systems, philosophical... ideas. That's all great, little brother. But where are the real men? We're a nation of pseudo-men who are sucking each other off behind closed doors. It's a shame. We have a long day tomorrow. I... I'm gonna get some sleep. I love you, brother. Mm-hmm. Oh, it fucking stinks. Don't go in there. Something you ate? Shit stinks. No big deal. Did you look at it? What? No. You should really look at it. It's a snapshot of your health. A snapshot of my health? What, do you look at your shit? - Absolutely. All the time. - Well, that's fucked up. It's for your health. For my health? I'm not looking at my turd. I just try to flush it down as fast as possible. Dan, it's science. You're supposed to look at it, the color, the shape, the firmness or lack thereof. Whether it floats or not... by the way, it's ideal if it floats. Look, I'm not checking out my shit or your shit, for that matter. Is this more of the bullshit from your therapist? I mean, she encourages me to express my thoughts. Your therapist is a woman? Yes. I think it helps me get in touch with my feminine side. Your feminine side? The next thing you're going to tell me is that you're gay. Dan, I'm not gay. Well, that's a relief. I mean, I have thought about it a few times. Haven't you? N-no, that's disgusting. If Dad ever thought I had any doubt, any question about my sexuality, he'd beat the living shit out of me. Well, Dad's not asking you, I'm asking you. No. Never, ever. That's not what a man is. Oh, really? You have never done anything with another guy. Not even when you were younger, like, jerking off together, see how far you could fire your jizz? Yeah. Me and my buddies would go camping, we'd get drunk. And, uh, then, you were probably too young to remember. And one of the guys would whip out his dick and start jacking off and then the rest of us would jack off. It's normal... - Mm... - Guys like to jerk off. That's not normal. Not all dudes like to jack off. Don't you jack off? Uh-uh. I need to conserve my Kundalini. What's that? Kundalini? Never heard of that? - No. - So... in Hindu philosophy, you need to conserve your... "man fluid." It's essential to achieving spiritual enlightenment. Man fluid? Can't you just say semen? I... I feel good when I come. It relaxes me. I like the feel of my dick in my hand at the end of a stressful day. Well, it feels good for me to conserve my man fluid. I think you've got everything backwards, little brother. I think the more I come, the better. You're a man. You're potent. You can make a lot more of those little spermatozoas. Why can't you be normal like me? Whew, the cam. All right. Here we go. - All right... - Got it? You wanna sit? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's... let's sit and look at this. See what we got. 'Kay. Gotta open her up. And... There we go. There we go. Okay. Oh! Hey, there's our, there's our sow. Not as... not as big as the grizzly. - Look. Look, look, look. - Oh. Three little cubs. Maybe next year, man. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe if I get the extra points, I'll get a shot of them. - Oh... - Oh. - That's our buck... - There is. There he is. Ah, man, he looks so fucking smug... He's huge. Look it, he's taunting us. I... I think we should go upstream... - No, he's headed that way. - Yeah. - So we catch him upstream... - Up here, yeah... Out in the open. I think I can get a shot at him. - Okay. Sounds good. - I'm gonna put this back. Oh, there he is. You know, there's no way in hell he would come out into the open like this. His bedding must be nearby. No, he's hungry. He's, uh... You know, he's... He's definitely looking for food. Temperatures are dropping. Wind's picking up but I sprayed our gear. No, he smells us. He's fucking with us. All right, give me that. Take your shot. All right. - We've gotta go after him. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, - whoa, whoa. Stop, stop. - We need to go after him. He has to... He has to drop. He needs time to fall. He'll fucking get over the ridge and get away. Look at this. - It's fresh. - That is very fresh. - Very fresh. - He's bleeding. He's bleeding. Look, there's more up there. And there. There. Look at this, look at this. - Look at this. - That's a lot of blood. Yep. Look at that. There's a track mark here. It's gone. Yeah, we're getting close. Blood. Off this way. Ready? Yeah. Let's go. All right. - Over the ridge. - Here, there, there. Watch your step. Okay. - Okay, maybe... - Over here! Okay. You good? Yup. I'm good. We have to keep going. He's wounded. He might bleed out. He'll get away. If he's meant to be yours, he will be yours. Man... Close your eyes. Breath. Feel nature all around you, moving to and through you. Now find the energy of the buck. Let him guide you. This isn't Star Wars, little brother. Keep your eyes closed. Breath. Feel the stillness of nature, the beauty. Now. Still your mind. Tune into the frequency of your desire, the buck. Walk alongside him as your friend, your confidant. Tell him through your thoughts that it's all going to be okay and it's time... to surrender. Tune into the frequency of your desire, the buck. Walk alongside him as his friend, his confidant. And with your thoughts... let him know that it's okay. That it's time to surrender. You know, I just realized something. It's the only time my mind's completely still, when I'm on the trail of an animal. You were a legend in high school. How many girls did you de-flower? That's nothing to be proud of, Dan. But you should be fucking proud of it. And what about Cindy O'Leary, the one with the big tits? - Yes, I remember Cindy... - You remember her? - Yes. - Well, you told me you screwed her in her bedroom and her parents were asleep next door. Her dad was the police chief and Irish on top of it. You were sweating bullets because you thought if he caught you that he would arrest you or he'd fucking kill you. God. I was such a douchebag. You know, I apologized to her years later for humiliating her the way I did. Yeah, she was after you from the first day of freshman year, remember? You shagged her behind the baseball diamond after your team won the league championship. Yes, yes, we had sex. But man, I really hurt her feelings. What? What do you mean? Do you remember that poem that I wrote her? And it got out and everybody on the quad was reading it? Uh, no... - No? - Not really. Well, yeah... - You don't remember this? - I mean, it was nothing. Your lips are like cherries, succulent and sweet. Your breasts are like apples. - Big... - Big, round, and cheap. Yeah. I mean, dude, you were 16. It's still a fucked up thing to do, man. You know what? You sure know how to ruin a good time. Here we are, recalling the good old days. Look, I don't want to have this conversation with you. - Why not? - Because your attitude towards women is really offensive. What are you talking about? I love women. I think talking about Cindy O'Leary's breasts is grossly inappropriate. What, are you fucking kidding me? Now we... Like, women's... are off limits? You're a classic misogynist. You really are. Just like Dad. Have you been privy to anything that women say about us? It's far worse than anything we could ever say. It's like we're catalogued and tagged like hunting deer, a piece of meat. Women in their tiny Chinese minds are much more... - Whoa, whoa, whoa... - ...offensive than anything - we could ever say. - Did you just say, "Tiny Chinese minds"? It's an expression. Jeez, is there a race or ethnicity or gender that you don't degrade or disrespect? I mean, think about how derogatory that just sounded, given that none of the women that you're talking about are, in fact, Chinese. You know what? Asian women are far worse in their contempt for men than any of the other races. God! Will you just please enter the 21st century? What planet are you on? How many women have you been with? What? I... I have... I have no idea. Well, give me a rough estimate. 100. What's your point? My point is that women want to be with you either because you've got a good body and you've got big cock or... you have a big bank account, you're successful and you can provide security for them. I think that women are a lot more complicated than that and you're just not giving them enough credit for their integrity. - Really? - Yeah. Well, I've been in my home office on Fridays, so I've been, you know, I've... I've been aware of Sarah's little coffee klatsches. And when I tuck the kids in at night, I've been privy to her goddess only dinner parties. They talk about what we talk about but in much more steely, cunning and ruthless terms. For us, it's the thrill of the chase. For them, it's like bagging big game. We're the ones who are hunted, shot, bled dry, hung upside down, - skinned and quartered. - You've got to be kidding me. You don't really believe that, do you? We give them our... our hearts and souls. We give them our guts. And what do we get back? Whining and complaining about the car not working. Or a bigger television set, or a better neighborhood. Or, "Why can't we afford an Ivy League school for the kids?" What about Sarah? Ah, yeah. Sarah. She's one of the best. A magnum cum laude Vassar graduate. She's kind of like, that, one of those Ivy League classy babes that... Like Jenny in Love Story. Jenny. That's right, Jenny. She was... studying music at Radcliffe University. Wealthy Oliver Barrett, Harvard Law student, falls in love with her. - It was... - It was Dad's favorite movie. - Oh, wait. No, it wasn't. - Second favorite. Yes, we both know what Dad's favorite movie was. The Godfather! Every holiday, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas was an excuse for the Madden family to gather around the TV to watch the epic saga of the Corleone family. Oh, man. Do you remember Dad would tell that story over and over again about how Brando got the role? You know, the studio didn't want him 'cause he was washed up and he was a troublemaker. Yeah. Brando stuffed his cheeks with cotton and got the role. - And the rest was history... - The rest is history. What a great film. Seriously. I could never figure out why Dad would watch that movie, Love Story, so many times. Um... Diane. Stepmom, the one that got away. Yeah, but no one could hold a candle to Mom. Yeah, but she was a... She was a pretty good stepmom. She was. Andrew came along just when she was thinking of leaving. Oh, God, Andrew, I love that kid. But with women, as they say, "Can't live with them. Can't live without them." But women reduce men to stereotypes, like... good body, big cock, financially well-equipped. I've actually heard them say, - "Well-equipped." - Dan, Dan, Dan, I just... I don't know why you're so cynical, man. Because women reduce men to a fucking ledger. Like, a check and balance sheet. They've got it in their tiny Chinese... In their tiny brains. Thank you. And trust me, I know women a lot better than you. Do you even realize that if anybody besides me heard you say that, you would be thrown out of your top ten law firm right on your ass? Here's some more of that MeToo feminist bullshit. No, it's not bullshit! Women have been marginalized for thousands of years. Why the hell can't they be appreciated when they deserve it? Deserve it? To see everything we've fought for, for the last 250 years just be thrown away, given away to minorities, women, - socialists, the welfare state... - No, but these movements, the Black Lives Matter movement, the MeToo movement, I mean, they're very important. They're just a bullshit excuse for a free ride. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Now you really sound like Dad. You know what? Just because I'm a white male doesn't mean that I can't run a corporation better than some Wellesley female graduate, come home to a beautiful wife who wants to make love with me in the house that I paid for with my blood, sweat and tears... Okay, okay. I've been with a lot more women than you and I sure as hell respect them a lot more. I always said, "You were God's gift to women." I never said you understood them... Okay, no, no, no, no. This is all I'm trying to say. All right? Women deserve respect. Am I right about that? They work harder than you. If they're better than you, they deserve a higher salary, a bigger office, the right to be recognized for their accomplishments. I'm going to nominate you as the poster child for the feminist movement. Have you heard anything I've said for the last half hour? Women don't care about accomplishments. They care about feelings and being heard... And they don't deserve to be belittled by elitist, white men like you who think they run the world... That's because we do run the world. Look at any top eight accounting firm, any movie studio, any law firm, any big corporation... It's almost always run by men who know how to wield power and make something that big and intricate work. Do you really think that any woman can run a Fortune 500 company, invent the next cure for SARS or AIDS or the next fucking epidemic? 99% of the certified, acknowledged geniuses throughout history were men. That's because we think differently than women, we're physically stronger than women. And we can control our emotions better than women. What women need is a man to take control, not be a little pussy like you! Well, I can see where this discussion is going. That whiskey tastes like shit. Just put the glass down. Come on upstairs. Sit. There's a lot of Dad's favorite whiskey up here. I'm going to give you a little taste of one of his... One of his favorites, 21-year-old... little blend, here. He had all his best whiskey up here. It's been up there this entire time? Yep. Just hiding away up here. Here you go. Thank you. Cheers. I want to ask you a question. Okay. When you were in high school, playing sports or... In the locker room shower... did you ever... check out the other guys? Sure. So what? I mean... we'd slap each other on the ass after games. I mean, honestly, we'd do so many things to each other after games that anybody from the outside would think we were gay. We'd slap each other on the bare ass and towel whip each other's balls, but... hey, we were confident in our sexuality. We were men. We liked pussy. That's not what I'm asking. All I'm trying to say is... I don't think that you have been... really honest with me. About what? A lot of things. Uh... That's kind of vague. What about that incident at your office Christmas party in the men's bathroom? I told you to never... - Okay... - Never mention it. Okay. Okay. Um... what about your relationship with Dad, the way he treated you. Mm. What about it? What do you... What do you mean? Like when you used to come home from the fraternity, from college and... you guys were fighting all the time. Fighting? - Yes. - Yeah. So maybe if it was, like, you know, which game we were gonna watch on TV. Or it was about how he wanted you to get a career so you could support yourself. So you're saying I went to law school because Dad wanted me to? I mean... That's bullshit. I lo... I love the law. - Do you? - Yeah. Do you remember when I told Dad that I wanted to be an EMT and a firefighter? Yeah. And he encouraged you. What are you talking... He said it wasn't a real career. Like, it was... It was a career that people got into because they didn't know what the hell - they wanted to do. - Wait, wait, wait. Dad... - Dad would never say that. - He did say that. Oh, wow. Well... Yeah. I would tend to agree with him. And that's why you're an asshole. And that's why I make a lot more money than you. - Okay. - Uh... I have a gorgeous wife who wants to ride my dick when I come home. And I have two beautiful kids that adore me. When was the last time you looked into your wife's eyes and said, "I love you," or, "You're beautiful." I... I don't know but she knows that I do. What, through your actions? Yes, through my actions. Providing a lot of money in the bank, a beautiful lifestyle, private school for the kids, an upscale, gated community. And you think that that's what a woman really wants? Oh. I got you. Um... you're talking about sex. - Yeah. - We have a great sex life. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Sarah's sister confided in me. Oh, man. She said that Sarah was... She was thinking about leaving you not too long ago. She's actually been thinking about it for a while. She says you two don't communicate anymore. You... Your sex life is non-existent. Ah, man. That's not true. I've just been a little... a little off my game, lately. Would it have anything to do with... Penis problem? What? Look, that's none of your goddamn business. And I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't call it that. Sorry. You know, it's funny what happens to your face when you get mad... Oh, 'cause I look just like Dad, yeah, I know... - It's kind of terrifying. - Fuck you. You idolized him, didn't you? Mm, yeah, pretty much. Even when he was not around, he was on business trips and... cheating on Mom. He was supporting his family like any real man would do... Oh, is that what he was doing? Yes. Even when Mom was getting her ulcers, riddled with anxieties, sick and tired of being ignored. - Come on. - Man. So... I got'cha. So you're saying that I'm doing that to Sarah? Is that it? Fuck off, damn you. Oh, God, old man. Ha! - You're an old man. - Don't start with me. No, you're the one with the rickety-ass knees. - Don't fuck with me. - You wanna go? - Yeah, I've had 'em... - All right. - I'm sick of this. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. Let's do it. - Let's go. Come on, old man. What you got? - Jab! - Come on. One, two. - Yeah? - Ah! Two. Ah! - Come on, cross... - Who's the old man? - Cross. - Okay. There you go. - There you go. - One. Who taught you to spar? Come on. Come on. You taught me to box which is kind of a shocker right now - because it doesn't really look like you're... - But you can't take it, right? All right. My hands, my hands, my hands! - All right, it's my turn. - Pussy. No, no, no, put 'em up, put 'em up! Nope, nope. I'm out o' here. I'm... - gonna go play the piano. - Are you serious? You're walking away from this? - Yeah. - Oh, it's music time. - It's music time. - Got it. Beautiful! Want a drink? Uh...

We sure were. I need a drink. You need a drink? I need a drink, too. Thank you, brother. Good job, there. - Cheers. - Cheers. See ya. You know, you should really quit smoking. Start dinner. So you decided to grace us with your presence. I'm just passing through. Can I spend the night? Yes. Yes! Oh, man. - Here it is. - Wow. This is a lot of Dad. It's a lot of Dad. This is something. You guys awake? Mm-hm. Mm... Hm. So what are you doing here anyway? I'm just passing through, on my way to Palm Springs. You know, Palm Springs is two hours from L.A. I heard that you had... that you had something to talk to us about. I changed my mind. Well, it's clearly not about soccer, is it? No. Palm Springs is a pretty gay town, wouldn't you say? Oh, my God. Are you serious? You want to talk about the blowjob that you got from your assistant in the bathroom of your law firm? Fuck you, Steven. Okay. If you guys are trying to shock me, that stuff happens all the time. - No big deal. - It was a guy... Fucker. I told you not to say anything about that. No, no, no, listen. Happened more than once. It didn't mean anything. But did you like it? What's that supposed to mean? - Are you gay? - Are you? I'm goin' back to sleep. I need to talk to you guys. I just have no one I can really trust. Um... like, all my friends is always about the game and sports and girls and I just feel... - Like a freak. - Whoa, you are not a freak. You know what? While you two pansies talk about all your gayness, I'm going back to sleep. I have some serious hunting to do tomorrow. Why do you like killing animals? I don't like killing animals. It's called animal conservation. That's such bullshit. It's actually not. I... I pay a fucking fortune for... hunting licenses and ammo and all the costs that go into it. But actually... I think you could enjoy the hunt, but... the really fun part is butchering the animal. That's disgusting. How you butcher the deer has a lot to do with the quality of the meat. Okay. I don't understand how you get pleasure from butchering animals, but I'm vegan. Little brother, do not give up eating meat. That's protein and... and iron. It gives you that extra aggression when you fuck and when you play sports. Bullshit and you know it. Look, Andrew does not like killing. That's your thing. That has always been your thing. I don't enjoy killing. I enjoy the process. But, you know what? Next time... you can pay all the hunting costs and the tags and the fees and all of it that goes into it. That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about feelings. Fuck feelings. Hunting as we know it today is a public-private partnership that was instituted by Teddy Roosevelt in the early 1900s. Jesus. Hunting sustains the species habitat and other animal habitats, waterways, forests and ecosystems. Those are the facts. We got that. But Andrew is just morally against it. Hunters have been the engines of sustainability over the last hundred years, and financially, their investment has revitalized... Animal pop... Oh, my God. Has revitalized animal populations. You sound like fucking John Wayne. Who's John Wayne? What? Are you serious? I guess you... You're not into classic movies, are you? Oh, no. I tried to avoid the television room all the time when Dad was in there watching movies, unless it was... The Godfather! Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey, that movie was pretty cool. Ah... Why do you hate gay people so much? I like pussy. If you like cock, go for it. I don't know if I do. I'm... Exploring. Well, don't ever fucking talk to me about it. I'm not interested in hearing your cunty feelings, bullshit angst about connection and all that touchy-feely stuff that has nothing to do with being a man. The fact is... You're just scared. Well, I'm scared. I admit that. I'm scared that I'll wake up one morning and... I'll be a carbon copy of Dad. Yeah, that scares me. Would that be so bad? At least he knew who he was. Dad was a racist. How could he be a racist, Andrew? He married your mom, Diane. Who was like a second mother to us, by the way. I know he loved us but that didn't extend to anybody else outside of our inner circle. And he never had any gay friends. Yeah. I mean, he's... he's got a point. Dad was a... misogynistic, conservative asshole who didn't tolerate anyone or anything left of center, especially people's sexuality. I think... Dad was one of the most tolerant people I've ever met. What the hell - are you talking about? - Ah, man. Jane Fonda. Hanoi Jane. To the day he died, he didn't forgive that woman for going to North Vietnam and protesting the war. I mean, that's how tolerant he was. Love Jane Fonda. Well, you two pussies will have something to talk about. What's he talking about? Stud here, who can have any girl he wants has been thinking about it. You really want to go there? Is that true, Steven? I've been... in therapy, lately. And I have this recurring nightmare where... Where it's really dark and... there's this shadowy figure and he's... He's chasing me. But I can't... I can't run away because I'm frozen. And I'm afraid that if this... shadowy figure gets to me that I will die. Then I wake up. Have... have you ever been with a guy? No. Hallelujah. - Really? - Okay, I... I think I'm going to sleep. I've got to wake up early in the morning... - Great idea. - Uh... - Good night. - Good night, man. Thanks for listening. Hey, you guys. Mm... I have one more thing to say about hunting. One more thing: Hunting is positive for the community. It builds long-lasting relationships and mutual respect. It gives families something to work towards, goals, aspirations, something to plan for. Ultimately, you're putting food on the table and depending on how competitive you are and how determined you are to be successful, this feeds back into spending more money on ammo and guns and feeds the conservation funds in the system. And I think that's what Dad was trying to teach us. I think I figured it out, why I don't like hunting. I mean, Andrew, it's okay. I mean... not everybody likes hunting. But it's more than that. It's more than just killing animals, watching them suffer. It's because Dad loved it. I mean, it was his whole world, outside of us. And I just realized... I don't want to be like him. I met someone. That's great. No, really. What's her name? Dorian. - Dorian's a guy's name. - Would you shu... It could be a girl's name, too. Where did you meet her? At a bar... In West Hollywood. West Hollywood? Dorian's a guy. Are you gay? - You are not gay... - What if he is? Okay, well, Dad's not here. All right? And... and... and I've been thinking about it for a while. And one night, finally, I got drunk and I went to a bar in West Hollywood and Dorian sat next to me. And we hit it off, all right? He's sweet and nice. Anything happen? No, not yet. But he invited me to Palm Springs. And... and that's who I'm meeting. He wants to take our friendship to the next level. That is disgusting. Think about it. Is that really what you want? I don't know, Dan! I'm just questioning it. That's it. Well, fuck the questions. Be a man. You've got a cock. You've got balls. Use them where they're supposed to go which is in a vagina. Oh. So it's okay for you to get a blowjob form some dude... Multiple, multiple blowjobs in the bathroom at your law firm, Dan. I think I've made my point. Don't listen to little pansy-ass Steven. Can we talk about something else? Why? Because you're too closeted to accept the possibility? There is no possibility. Are you still going to see that dude at work? That... dude at work was a law clerk that left the firm over a year ago. I don't even remember his name. Are you sure about that? Fuck you, Steven. His name is Edward and he's an adorable little law clerk. How... how did you... You should check your phone. I'm pretty sure his name and number are still in there. - Fuck you... - Hey, hey, stop it, you two. I didn't come here to cause a fight. What are you doing? I need my CBD pills. I got some weed if you want to smoke. No, I need the pills. They work faster and they're, um... they don't smell. How did you... Sarah's sister told me. Oh, Melanie. That nasty bitch. Look, Sarah was convinced that you were having an affair because of your... Penis problem. What penis problem? Means he can't get it up anymore. It happened a couple of times and why do you always exaggerate? Because you always exaggerate about my prowess. I'd like to level the fucking playing field every once in a while. But Edward, are you gonna keep seeing him? He sounds like a nice guy. Nice? He sucks me off occasionally. He says he loves my cock. Well, I'm sure you can get a boner with him. Fuck you. Okay, but is he a nice person? It's just sex. Is he a nice person? That's... it's a simple, straightforward question. Yes. He's nice. Oh, okay, so... so it seems like you would say something afterwards. Do you like talking to him? Yes, sometimes. I'm going back to bed. End of discussion. Night, guys. Good night. You realize kidnaping is a federal offense? Hey, buddy, it's our turf. You play by our rules. What's so funny? - Where... where are we goin'? - It's a surprise, and there's tofu and sprout sandwiches in there, - so get ready. - Yes! - I don't like surprises. - Now. Oh,. How's that throw? You gotta spin it. - Haven't played in a while, huh? - Just keep it here... Don't... don't throw both balls, come on... And spin it. You can try juggling You can do juggling. Can I kick it? Look how good that is. Well, I know. He's been doing it his whole life. God. What? - Look at him. - Here, try this. Try it underhand. Like that. All right, all right. Okay, okay. I'm not mad at that. - One more. - Okay. All right. What was that? That was the... That's all I got. You were like this. Oh, yes. - Oh, wait. Don't I have to... - Thank you. They're twist off. Oh, yeah. You don't need a bottle opener for this, man. Just twist it in your hand. Did you do it? It just seems a little... hard. Ah, this is disgusting. Ah, I think... I think it tastes good. Cheers. Skol. Skol? We're Vikings now. That was a fun one, though. So good to see you as always. Ah, thank you for everything, seriously. Anytime. Anytime. Drive carefully, okay? Okay. I definitely will. - All right. - All right. - You guys have fun hunting. - Thanks. Ah... Hey, Andrew. Thanks for having me. Look, see... I know you're doing something you think you really want to do, but you do not want to do this. Maybe I do. It's in the Bible, the word of God. Men do not lie with men. If you would just come hunting with Stevie and me, just connect with nature. I mean, why... why don't you just stay with us? I can't, Dan. Killing innocent animals... Innocent? What planet are you living on? This is a dog eat dog world. It's Darwinian. And it's played out no more vividly and authentically than in the animal world. It seems cruel. If you would just understand what I'm saying, you wouldn't even be thinking about all this gay shit. I honestly don't understand the correlation between the two. Because being a human being and having ethics and morals is all about being a good sportsman and that takes a lot of experience and practice. I respect your right to hunt, but you need to respect my choices. The point is hunting is a metaphor for life. So, whether you commit to relationships with men or women, you need to be confident that you're going to make a good shot and that you're going to make the best choice possible. It's not like I have a choice. You do have a choice. But no matter how this chapter plays out for you, I'll always love you, brother. But if you are gay, I've got to be honest with you, I'm gonna be really disappointed. So, don't come crying to me when you get disillusioned or you get some God awful disease or you realize too late that having a wife and family is what God intended for you. I love you, too. Even if you're a misogynistic, chauvinistic homophobe who's a pigheaded, competitive son of a bitch. Well, you really fucked that one up. I'm hungry. Let's go catch some real food. Thank you. 'Kay. Down, down, down, down, down, down. Down, down, down, down. 'Kay, come on. We have to search for it a little bit. It fell down over in this area. I thought it... I thought it... No, no, no. No, no, no. Right here. You got... You gonna pick it up? Yeah. I got it. Got it? Beautiful, right? Yeah! - All right. - That way? Yeah, let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell are you doing? What the fuck? Don't ever touch my rifle again. You cannot shoot a cougar in California. We hunted them in Oregon. Last time I checked, we're not in Oregon, are we? Fuck. No. - Jeez. Come on. - You're right. Look at that beauty. Nice shot, brother. I got her. Okay. Come on, let's go. Beautiful shot, brother. Looks like we're gonna have a good dinner tonight. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Oh, man. Shit. That's heavy. Fuck. Ow. - Whew. - Whew, you okay? Oh, nice. This right here. Nice one, brother. Nice, tasty steaks. We got another good one right here. Look at that. Look at that. What? What else did Melanie say about me? Just what I told you, that things have been different for the past six months. You know, one day, my sex life with Sarah was great. My dick would just pop up like it always did. And then... - Yeah? - I don't know, I... I couldn't. It... It wouldn't... Just, just like that? Well, not all at once, but she definitely noticed. So, what did she say? Nothing at first. Um, I made some excuse of extra stress at work. I was exhausted. And uh, then I just turned my back on her and went to sleep. But, try as I might, I could not get hard. And, I couldn't even jack off in the shower like I'd usually do, just so I'd last longer before we made love. It's like my dick just went limp. Did you see a doctor about this? Yeah, I did. He said it was stress and prescribed Viagra. Okay. And then did you tell Sarah? Fuck, no. You show weakness, it's all over. Dude, you must have talked about this. I mean, she was more upset about the idea of her husband having a limp dick than the thought that I might be having an affair. And I said, I assured her that wasn't the case. And how did she react to that? She's been really understanding, actually. Okay. She said that... that I shouldn't worry about it but like, I could tell she had her doubts that I was telling her the truth. All right, so maybe therapy could help at this point. No, fuck therapy. I don't need any shrink analyzing my dick. Okay, so what about the Viagra? Does that help? I'm not using a pill to make me hard. Screw that. What about Edward? Ah, man. Sometimes, we would just sit in my car and talk. I mean, he's a nice guy, but uh, I think I might not see him anymore. I want to focus on Sarah. I want things to work with her. Things are going to work out, man. When they do, you're going to get your old self back. It's your move. I'm not even sure who that is anymore. Look, you talked about it. It's a very good start. And it's good to be vulnerable. Oh, yeah. So she thinks that I need a pill to make me hard, that her tits don't do it for me. Fuck that. Weakness is strength. And from that, love can grow. Are... are you fucking kidding me? You sound like... You sound like a Hallmark card. Check. I do have a way with words. People tell me that. Man... Maybe I'm going through menopause. Well, if you are, your secret's safe with me. Oh, hallelujah. Checkmate. Uncle Richie texted me. Wonders why you're not talking to him anymore. He seems really hurt. Mm, give him a call when I get back to L.A. You guys were so close. What are you doing? Just cutting him out of your life? It's unfortunate. He paid for your school, Dan. You barely even mention him anymore. Look. Can we concentrate on the task at hand? I want to come home with this buck. Something's not adding up. I mean, you're... you're not telling me something, - I can feel it... - Steven! You're starting to fucking piss me off. Listen, you're lying to me about something, what is it? You fucking touch me again, I'll deck you and I'll go hunting on my own! Look. Look, look, look, look. - More blood. - Yeah, it is. Look, look, look, look, look, look. Look, look, look, look. There he is. There he is. 12 o'clock. - Dead ahead. You got him? - Yeah. - Easy. - I got him. Smooth. Oh. Oh, come on! Fuck. Grazed him. - Ooh. - You okay? I feel light-headed. Okay. Okay. You are looking a little pale. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Can you sit down for me? - Yeah. - All right. Have a seat. Do you have a... Where's your water? - Here... - I've got some in my backpack. Gimme that. Gimme that. I got some water in my backpack. Hydrate. Damn, I thought I had him. Fuck. We've bagged some pretty big bucks over the years, but man, we're losing sleep over this one. I'm such a fucking lousy shot. You are. I'm just kidding! Temperature's really droppin'. Storms going to come in. We don't have a lot of daylight left. He's gonna come out and feed. He's gotta be around here somewhere. There's that son of a bitch. On the ridge. Are you ready? Steady. Smooth. There he is, man. Take the shot. Dan. Pull the trigger. Take the shot! Dan, pull the trigger. Take the shot! Come on, let's go home. Hey! The hell's the matter with you? Six years you've been waiting for that buck! Come on! What happened out there today? I couldn't do it. You're a hunter. That's what you do. That's what you've always done. Yep. What we've always done, what Dad taught us. That's right. Mm. Well, that's not me anymore. Dan, if this Sarah thing is affecting you this much, then you really need - to handle it. - That's... that's not it. Then what is it? I started thinking... "What would Dad do?" I mean, first off, he would have dropped the buck the first time. And he wouldn't shoot unless he had a clean shot. Everybody has different hunting styles, individual, personal hunting styles. Right. And then I started thinking, "Well, what's my style of hunting?" The way I hunt is the way Dad used to hunt. And then... Then something just... occurred to me. And what's that? Well, what's my style of hunting? And? I didn't know. And then it became very clear I didn't want to kill the buck. I didn't want its meat. I didn't want another trophy to mount in my den, another kill that just said I was a man. I didn't want to cut up and pack up more meat, mount a bigger pair of antlers. And then I started to think about Uncle Richie. Uncle Richie? Why I couldn't pick up the phone and call him back? I don't know who I am anymore. What was it your ex-girlfriend said to you? That you were a bad version of yourself? Oh, no, no. She had no idea what the hell she was saying. No, no, no, she was right. We're bad versions of who we're supposed to be. You do realize she was just saying that to fuck with my head. We're maybe a good version of Dad, but we're probably bad versions of ourselves, just little carbon copies of these little men that Dad molded into these supposed adults. And then, I started to think about why I couldn't call Uncle Richie back because of the lie that I've been living all these years. If I'm pushing you to a place that you don't want to go to, then I'm all good. Just tell me. Are you fucking kidding me? You and your therapy bullshit. You've been on me... - What? - Since the beginning - of this trip. - Wow. My life is out of control. I just wish... You wish what? Talk to me. I wish Uncle Richie would just fuck off and die and stop bugging me. I'm not following you right now. Because I love you. And I don't want to hurt you. Honestly, Dan, in this moment, I would rather you hurt me if it would help you heal. Why are you so good, brother? Why are you so fucking good? Is that all you do, is think about other people? Pretty much, I guess. What was the one thing Dad taught us if nothing else? It was to look out for number one. Where does considering everybody else in front of yourself make number one happen? It doesn't. It doesn't, man. You need to think about yourself first. And then when you're good, you can think about your loved ones. We're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one, all right? And we're done drinking for the evening. Remember when I got into law school? The one that I really wanted but the tuition was astronomical? I wanted Ivy League and Tufts was calling. It wasn't officially an Ivy League school but it had a reputation equal to Harvard and MIT. Dad obviously did not have the money. And uh, getting a loan back in that day wasn't easy. Oh, so this is where Uncle Richie came into the picture? Ha, ha. Remember, we used to call him Richie Rich because he had so much fucking money from the dot com craze? Yeah, I mean, 20 million was it? - Easily. Yeah. - In cash? Who has that kind of money nowadays? So Uncle Richie stepped up and paid for my entire four years of law school plus the bar in one swoop for the mighty... Yeah, I know this. $150,000. Everybody knows this. It's not a secret, Dan. And it's nothing to be ashamed of. But things are not given in life without conditions. And this came with one big condition, although never discussed or clearly stated... Well, you paid it back, right? - With interest. - Which, I don't understand that. I mean, he didn't need the money. No. He didn't need the money. But, he needed me to keep living the lie that I've been living all these years. What... What lie? I don't understand. When I was about seven-years-old and Uncle Richie would always come over, spend a lot of time at our house. He and Dad were so close. They would spend hours in the den reminiscing about old times, smoking cigars, drinking scotch. Okay, but, nothing wrong with that. It was... It was the way he looked at me. Just... I knew there was something wrong, but he made me feel so uncomfortable. Well, I mean, I always heard that there was a gay uncle in the family. It just didn't occur to me that it was Uncle Richie. Because Dad was so blatantly homophobic. To make a long story short, there was something that went on between me and Uncle Richie for several years. No, no, hell no. Dad would have stopped that. There is no way he would have put up with that. - Really? - Yeah. Even if he knew, our family would have collapsed without Uncle Richie's money. I mean, Dad was working on and off and... Mom was in and out of hospitals. God, man. That's fucker. How did you get away from him? How did you stop this? It... it took a while, but I was actually able to make a complete break. It kind of happened organically. I got older. I went to high school. I got busy with school. Got interested with girls. One day, Richie came knocking on my door and I told him, "If you ever fucking lay another hand on me ever again, I would tell Mom and Dad." And he would go to jail, his life would be over. Shit. I turned the tables on him. He was scared. But, it didn't end there. I'm so sorry, man, really. I confronted him again when you were born. I told him if he ever touched you, if he ever laid a fucking hand on you, I would kill him. I was just... I was so angry... about being abused. Sexually abused by that fucker. And I wanted to make sure that those family patterns didn't continue. So... I also extracted my revenge. I had him pay for my entire... education, including law school. - Lock, stock and barrel. - God, man. Shit. I'm so sorry, Dan. Fucker. How old were you when I started law school? Five, six? Um. Five, five, I think. And Dad was away working and Mom was... Yeah, she... That's when she had pneumonia, right? - She was at... - She was at her sister's. Yeah. And, who watched you? Who had the time to play with you, buy you things, hang out with you? Uncle Richie. I left Tufts after the first year on the pretext that I was moving back to be closer to Mom because she wasn't well. That was the truth. No. It was a lie. I knew that fucker was waiting in the wings, biding his time to have his way with you, just like he did with me. I mean, I didn't have the hard facts but I... I could feel it in my gut. Uncle Richie and I, we always... We had fun. He'd read me bedtime stories and he... he never touched me. You... You were... You were around, we played ball and... gave me baths. Yeah. I was there. I was there to protect you. You came into my room when I was scared. When Mom was away and Dad was working. Slept in the same bed together. And who was always touching you, making sure your every need was met? I thought we were... brothers. We loved each other. It's... Yeah, we loved each other, but... I thought that was normal. The hugging and the touching. Sexual abuse victims block out traumatic memories until... Until something triggers them. You're talking about my nightmare. You can't see who was after you, but... I think you know. No. - No. - Sorry. You son of a bitch. I'm gonna be sick. I forgive you. Did you hear what I said? I forgive you. I'm sorry. It's okay. You did the best you could. Can you do me a favor, though? You have to forgive yourself. Okay? It's okay. Come here. I'm sorry. I am so sorry, Steven. I'm sorry. I didn't meant to do it. I didn't mean to hurt you. - Okay. - I love you. I love you, too. You're everything to me. Come here. Gimme a hug. Maybe we should do something different next year. Um, I have a... a law school buddy who goes moose hunting in Alaska. Alaska? Sounds like an incredible adventure. I was thinking maybe we should just try something different. Get outside our comfort zone. I've always wanted to go to Alaska, on a cruise. Just as long as it's not a gay cruise, brother. Looks so old. Yeah. It's gonna be around for another 100 years, long after we're gone. I think maybe we should sell the place, uh... There's a lot of nice land around it. We can't do that. This was everything to Dad. Well, a new family could move in and make new memories. You really mean that? I think I don't want to go hunting for a while. I'm happy for you. Hey, instead of hunting, maybe we could try ping pong. Hm, how about billiards? Ice hockey. Chess? I guess what I'm saying is, I just... I want to be a better version of myself. You're going to see Edward? Oh, I don't know. I don't think I know myself as well as I thought. What about Uncle Richie? If he's going to hear me out and if I don't kill him, maybe we'll make amends. And your wife? Sarah? I... I want to come clean. I want to tell her everything. I think she knows. Women are very intuitive. I think she deserves to see all these different parts of me. I admire your courage. I admire yours, brother. Hey, do you, uh, do you think your bullshit therapist could see us next week? Yeah. Yeah. I'll... I'll give her a call on my way back. Oh, and another thing. Don't be so fucking nice all the time. Be a dick once in a while. - Okay. Yeah. - It feels good. I'll keep that in mind. Hi, honey. How was your trip? It was good. It was good. Uh... I didn't bag the godfather buck. I'm sure you'll get the buck next time. Yeah. I miss you. I missed you, too. The kids asked where you were. I can't read a bedtime tale like you. I... I think we should plan a trip together. Just you and me. What about work? I've got some things I need to talk to you about. Of course, honey, I would love that. Where? Big Sur coastline. What's the hotel you love? The It's too expensive. Book it, we can afford it. I'll see you soon. Bye, honey! Drive safe. Dan? I love you. I love you, too. Hurry home.
