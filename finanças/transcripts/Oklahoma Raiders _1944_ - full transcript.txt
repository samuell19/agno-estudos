Nectar of the Gods, my friend. Banjo Bonner's greatest scientific discovery. Cures all ailments of horse and man besides bein' useful to polish silver, gold, or brass. Hey, let me have your bugle a minute. - I'll show you something. - Sure, sure. Polish it off. I'll polish it off. [clears throat] - Ah... - Uh, uh, y-- you, you idiot! You, you ruined it! [man laughs] I'll get court-martialed for this. T-- Take it easy, my friend. I-- I must have made the formula too strong. Uh... Banjo: Attention! Howdy, Steve? - I mean, Lieutenant Nolan. - At ease, men. Say, I thought you were out chasin' them guerrillas who've been wreckin' our trains. - I was. - I was? Ain't you just chuck-full of information though. Seems to me you oughta tell me a little bit more than that. After all, I've been fightin' battle after battle besides workin' like mad on my formula just to help you and the cavalry. Colonel Rogers wishes you to report to him at once, sir, and bring Corporal Bonner with you. Thank you. Golly! Do you reckon the-- the Colonel knows about my invention? Never can tell. Lieutenant Nolan reporting, sir, with Corporal Bonner. Sit down. I've been going over the report on your activities in running down that guerrilla band, lieutenant. - It's excellent. - I was lucky, sir. Well, maybe you're right. I understand you're both from the Indian Territory. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. When my folks first moved out the Indian Territory I was just knee-high to a grasshopper. [chuckles] Mighty fine country out there, sir. Yes, so I've heard. Are you familiar with Benton County? Why, yes, sir. I believe that's the wild horse district. A number of ranchers settled there years ago, started the business of raising mustangs, sellin' 'em to the army for cavalry remounts. That's right, and they've proven exceptionally tough and dependable. However in the past few weeks, not one horse has been delivered to us. Arnold Drew, who has the remount contract for the Oklahoma Territory, seems unable to cope with a gang of outlaws who have been stealing these wild horses from him just as fast as he can get them rounded up. All that we've been able to find out is that the leader is known as El Vengador. El Vengador. That's Spanish, meaning the avenger. Sounds to me like there's a personal motive in this stealin'. Well, whether it's personal or otherwise, lieutenant, it must be stopped. You and Corporal Bonner will leave for Benton at once. Bring in this El Vengador and his troublemakers and see to it that the necessary horses are delivered to the army. We'll do the best we can, sir. With your permission, I'll go on ahead into the territory as a cowboy lookin' for work. Uh, Corporal Bonner can join me later. Here's where my great scientific formula pays off. How you operate, lieutenant, is entirely up to you. But remember, the army needs those remounts. Now when you reach Benton, look up James Prescott. He is the land commissioner there. He has written to me regarding this difficulty, so that he should be able to give you complete information. Yes, sir. Good luck. [dramatic music] [door opens] [dramatic music] Put up your hands. Alright, stranger, start reachin'. [intense music] [gunshot] [gunshot] - What's the trouble, sheriff? - I don't know. It sounded like that shot come from the Express office. [gunshot] [gunshots] Drew: I'm glad you got here, sheriff. I surprised a couple of men breaking into the Express office safe. One got away, but I shot this one. Is he dead? No, but he's very badly wounded. - Get Doc Edwards. - He ain't here, judge. He left last week to join the army. That's right. I'd forgotten that. Well, you better make arrangements to have him taken over to the doctor in Osage. He has a nasty head wound. Go get Williams and tell him to bring his wagon up here. If we can get him over to the doctor in time, he may tell us who his accomplice was. Yeah. Is that the letter you want, Prescott? Yes. Did anyone identify that stranger you shot? No, but Deputy Williams is takin' him over to Osage to get him patched up. He whatSay, if he comes to and does any talkin', it's gonna be plenty bad for us. I ain't sure whether he'd know Duggan and me again, but he certainly must have got a look at your face before you shot him. He's not gonna have a chance to do any talkin', Higgins. If you and Duggan knock on it, you can reach Cherokee Pass ahead of that wagon. We'll make it. [dramatic music] Hey, what's the idea? I'm taking you to Osage to see a doc. And when he gets through with you, I'm lockin' ya up. There's something wrong with this. I'll say there's something wrong about it. Hold out your other hand. Wait a minute. Just a minute! [gunshot] Oh! [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] He won't bother us anymore. [dramatic music] Well, we sure thought you were a goner. Yeah, I did too. Todd, get some water. Looks like you might have had a run-in with the law. Yeah. Ran into a little trouble in Benton. A deputy was takin' me to Osage. Said I needed a doctor. That hombre back down the road is dead, Miss Donna, and he was wearing a deputy sheriff's badge. I guess you were telling the truth. - Who are you? - Steve Nolan. Oh, I, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll be alright in a little while. Boone, put him on your horse. Blindfold him. We'll take him back to camp with us. Aren't you being kind of foolish, Donna? We don't know anything about him. He's hurt and he's in trouble, Todd. That's why most people come to us, isn't it? I know, but don't forget there's a $1000 reward on your head. As soon as word reaches Benton that he's escaped, there'll be a posse hot on our trail. The sheriff's been looking for us for quite some time without any luck. What about the two men that were after him? He was with a deputy, so they can't be officers of the law. Well, we won't cross our bridges till we come to 'em. [dramatic music] [singing "I'll Be A Cowboy Till I Die"] I made up my mind to change my way And quit the crowd that was so gay And I leave my home for a little while And travel West for many a mile When I arrive in Mexico I thought of her but I could not go So I wrote a letter a letter to my dear But not a word did I ever hear So take your gold and your silver too And pity the girl that won't prove true I'll travel West where the bullets fly I'll be a cowboy till the day I die - The herd alright, Todd? - Yeah. Well, what's wrong? Don't I look alright? Like a fashion plate. Steve must feel plenty flattered at the way you're trying to impress him. I don't know what's gotten into you lately, Todd. I'm not blind, Donna. Ever since Steve Nolan got here, you've spent practically all of your time taking care of him. I don't like it. You won't have to worry about that much longer. Steve's fully recovered and he's leaving today. I just hope he doesn't come back with the sheriff's posse. He's hardly in a position to get very friendly with the law. Hello, Todd. Say, much obliged for this outfit you loaned me. Never mind the thanks, come on down to the corral and saddle yourself a horse. We're riding a ways with you. I'll join you as soon as I change my clothes. You figuring on leaving the territory? Well, I have a little matter to settle with a gentleman in Benton. After that, who knows? Do you think you can get away with going back into a town where you're wanted by the law? Well, I can try. I'm smooth-shaven now. Wearin' different clothes. I don't think anybody will recognize me. Say, can you tell me what a girl like Donna's doin' in this kind of a set-up? What would you do if a bunch of crooks drove you out of your home and took over everything you owned? Try to get it back, I guess. That's just what Donna Ross is doing. Her father pioneered this territory along with most of the other men you've met here in camp. Yeah, and they were doing alright until the war came along. Then a bill was passed condemning their ranches and declaring Rainbow Valley a national park. Well, didn't the Territory try to pay 'em for the land? Yeah, sure. 25 cents an acre. Nothing for the equipment and horses. When Ross and the other ranchers refused to accept, Prescott, the land commissioner, took a sheriff's posse and drove them out at the point of a gun. Donna's father was killed in the fight. Not a very pleasant picture, Todd. But continuin' to buck the law won't help any. Why don't they protest to Washington? Clem Masters, the judge over at Benton, has been trying to help. But so far, it's been the same old run-around. [dramatic music] Oh, thank you, Donna. You've been mighty kind. Follow that trail. It'll lead you right out of the Badlands. - Goodbye, Steve. - Goodbye. And good luck. - So long, Todd. - So long. I got bad news for you, Miss Donna. I saw Judge Masters this morning. I suppose he heard from Washington. Well, the mail-rider says he brought in a letter one day last week for the judge postmarked Washington, but the Express office was held up the same night and the letter disappeared. Then the judge still doesn't know whether we've been granted a new hearing or not. And after all these months-- I'll bet Arnold Drew isn't shedding any tears. The longer the hearing's postponed, the better he'll like it. He probably had a hand in the robbery. I'm going after him. This time it's a showdown. We'll both pay the town of Benton a little visit, Todd. [singing "Out On The Open Range"] I wanna ride my pony over the prairie Out on the open range Herdin' the cattle dusty and weary Out on the open range I wanna see the sunset over the mountain Leavin' the moon so plain I wanna hit the saddle herdin' lazy cattle Out on the open range [yodeling] I wanna hear the wind blow over my campfire Brushing the smoke away Rolled in my blankets there by the campfire Waiting the break of day I wanna see the dawn break there in the mornin' Makin' me feel so strange I'll get my pals together then we'll hit the leather Out on the open range [yodeling] Very pretty! Very pretty! [laughs] Hurry, hurry, hurry! Step right up, my friends, I have here the greatest scientific discovery of the age! Banjo Bonner's famous nectar of the Gods! There ain't any sickness, man or beast, it will not cure. Ah, my good man, you look like you need a few treatments. [laughs] There ain't nothin' wrong with me that a little old Kentucky bourbon won't cure. [laughing] There you are, my good man. You have the basis for my magic formula. A little of that famous brew from Kentucky, plus some tea from 101 different herbs equals Banjo Bonner's famous nectar of the Gods. Yes, sir, one drink and you'll never know you ever had any troubles. - Smells alright, professor. - Of course, it smells alright. I've been drinkin' it for years. [coughs] [gasping] I'm dyin'. I'm burnin' up. Gimme some water... [coughing] Ah! Phew! Thanks, Mr. Prescott. Phew. Why, you little sawed-off runt. - Try to poison me, will you? - Just a minute. There-- There's something wrong with the formula-- Never mind what's wrong with the formula. You gave me that stuff, didn't ya? [explosion] Wreck my saloon, will ya? Well, it's gonna cost ya. - How much, mister? - Fifty dollars! - Fifty dollars? - Yes, fifty. Fifty, fifty dollars. Alright, now will you get outta here and take that stuff with ya! - Go on, beat it! - Ah, just a minute, cousin. If I was to drop this stuff, you'd never forgive yourself. Take it easy. - Feeling better now? - Yeah, I'm alright. Let me have your attention, men. I'm starting a wild horse roundup in the morning and I'm paying top wages for riders. Anyone that's interested can talk to my foreman, Duggan. He'll sign you up. Man 1: How long you think the drive will last, Mr. Drew? Drew: Oh, about two weeks. Man 2: You think El Vengador and his gang will give us any trouble this time? - I told you to beat it! - Well, I-- I thought I... I was kind of figurin' on hiring out to Mr. Drew. Well, I'll disfigure you if you don't get that box of dynamite out of here! [screams] Oh! Look, will you, please, take that stuff and get out of herePlease. Go now! Now get out of here. You don't know what you-- you're missin'. Go on, get out of here! You don't know what you're missin'! Oh, howdy, my friend? Uh, just a minute. You're just the man I'm looking for. Could I interest you in a little bottle to take home to your wife? It will surprise her. Uh-huh-huh. These one-horse towns. Unh-unh-unh. Banjo: Howdy, stranger? Could I interest you in a bottle of my famous nectar? - Oh, you might. - Howdy, lieutenant? - How long you been in town? - I just got here. Did you manage to find out anything? Well, when I hit town the other night, I got mixed up in a little robbery. Since then, I've been hiding out in the camp of El Vengador. - On the level. - On the level? I thought it was in the hills. [laughs] You're a fast worker. Then you know who he is. It ain't a he, Banjo. El Vengador is a girl and a mighty good-lookin' one. Well, I'll be doggone. A lady bandit? What will they think of next? - Did you arrest her? - No, not yet. I wanna check up on Arnold Drew and James Prescott before I make a move. Hm. [footsteps] [dramatic music] Well, if there's anything else I can do for ya, my friend, just look me up, send me a card, I cure everything. I won't forget. The one on the inside is J. Prescott. The one on this side, Arnold Drew. So that's Arnold Drew, huh? The man who has the army contract for wild horses. When I was in the saloon a few moments ago, they was hirin' men for a roundup to take place tomorrow. Hey, you look like you've seen him before. I have. He's one of the bandits that held up the Express office the other night. Say, Banjo, see if you can sign on the roundup. In the meantime, I'll have a little talk with Prescott and Drew. But if you was in on one of their robberies, hadn't they ought to know you? I'll soon find out. In the meantime, you do as I say and keep your mouth shut. Uh, uh, you bet, sir. You bet. [laughs] Yes, sir. [clears throat] New roundup is comin' - Mr. Prescott? - That's correct. What can I do for you? I'm Lieutenant Steve Nolan from the 7th Cavalry. Glad you're here, lieutenant. Meet Arnold Drew. He has the contract to supply the army with remount horses. - Mr. Drew. - Glad to know you, lieutenant. Well, we rather expected to see you in uniform. Well, I have my orders. Until I get to the bottom of the trouble around here, my connection with the army must be kept confidential. Colonel Rogers suggested that I have a talk with ya, Mr. Prescott. He said he thought maybe you could help me. Well, I'm glad to do anything I can for you, lieutenant, but Mr. Drew is in a better position to explain what we're up against. Well, there really isn't much to explain except every time we get a picked bunch of horses rounded up, they're stampeded and stolen by El Vengador and his outlaws. My hunters have located a big herd out in the south end of Rainbow Valley. I'm starting another drive in the morning, but I can't guarantee the horses will be delivered. The army needs those remounts and I was sent here to make sure they'll be delivered. So if it's alright with you, gentlemen, I'll go along with ya tomorrow. Fine, we can use every man available, and especially those that know how to handle a gun. Well, I've had some experience. [laughs] [door opens] Todd: That's right. Keep on reaching. [dramatic music] If you were thinking of collecting that reward money, you're out of luck. Donna Ross. So you're El Vengador. Todd Wingate. You have a letter addressed to Judge Masters. I want it. I don't know what you're talking about. Why would I be interested in the judge's correspondence? The same reason that Arnold Drew is. Now give me that letter. Unlock that desk. Open that box. [gunshot] [intense music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] Donna Ross is El Vengador. Go after her! She's got too much of a start. We can never catch her now. The next time you write to Washington, judge, don't forget to mention that the ranchers you're so interested in are known to be outlaws and are stealing horses intended for the United States Army. Masters: Young man, I'd like a few minutes talk with you if you don't mind. Go ahead. Suppose we go over to the sheriff's office. We won't be disturbed over there. [dramatic music] Now what's on your mind, judge? This. Now where is that letter you helped steal the other night? The one from Washington addressed to me? Say, what's this all about, anyway? Now don't alibi. Maybe no one else in this town recognized you, but I did. You took part in that Express robbery last week and Drew shot you. You seem to be well informed. You were wearing old clothes and had about three days' growth of whiskers on you. But I know what you looked like though for I was the one who bandaged your wound. Banjo: Somebody's gonna be bandaging you up, judge, if you don't drop that gun. I never stuck a judge up before, but I guess there's always a first time. Put your gun away, Banjo. "Lieutenant Steve Nolan. US Army." That's right. Now maybe we'd better have a little powwow. Steve: And that's about all I have to say, judge. Except that regardless of how much I believe in Donna Ross' innocence, the army must have those horses. And I agree with you, lieutenant. Our personal problems are unimportant compared to the preservation of the Union. You reckon the Ross girl and her friends will listen to reason if they're told what Steve's doin' out here? It's rather difficult to be patriotic, Banjo, when you're just one jump ahead of the law. That stolen letter might have been the solution to the entire problem. I'm leavin' in the morning on the wild horse roundup, judge. When you hear from Donna Ross or any of the other ranchers, give them this message from me. If they'll stay away from the valley until I get the necessary number of horses delivered to the cavalry, I'll personally take their troubles to Washington. I believe I'll be able to straighten things out for them. Thank you, lieutenant. [instrumental music] [indistinct shouting] [indistinct shouting] [indistinct shouting] - Look good, don't they? - They sure do. [horses neighing] Ah, ain't they the cute little rascals? Don't you think they're a little young for the cavalry? Well, it's been ten days now since we started the drive and El Vengador or her gang haven't showed up. Maybe somebody showed them the error of their ways. I doubt it, and I'd feel a lot better if that girl was in jail. Yes, I suppose you would, Drew. [singing "Roll On Little Doggies Roll On"] Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies roll on roll on Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies roll on Last night as I lay on the prairie And looked at the stars in the sky I wondered if ever a cowboy Would drift to that sweet by and by Now the road to that bright happy region Is a dim narrow trail so they say While the broad one that leads to perdition Is posted and glazed all the way Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies roll on roll on Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies roll on I'm scared that I'll be a stray yearlin' A maverick unbranded on high And get caught in the bunch with the rusties When the boss of the riders goes by Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies roll on roll on Roll on roll on Roll on little doggies Roll on Drew: You boys better get some sleep. I'll call you at midnight. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [horses neighing] [horses neighing] [gunshots] [gunshots] Sounds like a stampede! Roll out! - Hey, fellows. Wake up! - Get up! - Wake up! - Saddle up, saddle up. [gunshots] [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshots] Now you're gonna listen to me, Todd, whether you want to or not. Save your breath, you cheap double-crosser. I should have plugged you the other day in Prescott's office. Well, I can understand how you feel, but you're all wrong. Didn't Judge Masters deliver a message to you from me? Sure, but why should I believe any promises you might make? Donna took ya in and cared for you when you were wounded, but that didn't stop you from going back to Benton and siding in with Drew and Prescott. I was sent here to get remounts for the cavalry, and those wild horses are gonna be delivered if I have to bring in a company of troops and blast my way into your camp. You and Donna Ross aren't fighting the local law of the Territory now, Todd. You're up against the United States Army. But we've only taken what rightfully belongs to us. Well, I'm beginning to realize that now and I intend to see that the ranchers get a square deal. We're at war, Todd. Those horses are needed badly. It's not a question of who owns them or who gets paid for 'em. Well, I... never looked at it quite like that, Steve. If it's not too late, I'd like to help you. Well, you can start in by explaining to Donna and the other ranchers. Don't worry. I'll see that you get out of this. Good work, lieutenant. - Get any of the rest of 'em? - No, I didn't. Tie him up and put him on a horse. Higgins: You're right, Hank. He's not only a horse thief, he's a traitor to his country. And I'm bettin' he's a rebel sympathizer. There've been too many of these hombres coming in here lately disturbin' our peace. If we don't do somethin' about it, we're gonna lose our homes, our ranches, wagons, everything. Them vigilantes in California had the right idea. You bet they did. They knew what to do with a horse thief. Just wastin' the taxpayers' money. I got a note for you, Steve. Some fella up the street gave it to me, told me to give it to you. Say, listen to this. "Steve, come alone to Castle Rock, "1 mile west of the Forks. Important. Donna Ross." The female bandit. Uh, maybe it's a trap. Do you think you ought to go? Now, now, Banjo, you know it isn't polite to keep a lady waitin'. Besides, we've got to figure a way to get Todd out of jail. That's right. That crowd over there is gettin' ready to take matters in their own hands. Hello, Donna. Aren't you takin' quite a chance meeting me this way? - I might arrest ya. - Look over there. Well, I guess I'm the one that's takin' the chance. What did you wanna see me about? Todd Wingate. Steve, if I promise to ride into Benton with you and surrender to the sheriff, will you release him from jail? You think a lot of him, don't you? Yes, I do. Todd was my father's foreman. He had nothing to gain by joining the ranchers who were outlawed, but he helped them because he believed they were in the right. I'll make you a proposition. If I agree to break Todd out of jail, will you let the army have the horses you rustled from Arnold Drew? I never refused to sell horses to the army, but there was no way I could deliver them. Well, there is now. Get your men together, wait at the pass the other side of town. I'll meet ya there with Todd. And I'm tellin' you, men, if we don't take the law into our own hands, they're gonna turn him loose! We all know Judge Masters has been tryin' to help them horse ranchers. He'd never find Todd Wingate guilty. Now just a minute, fellas. Todd's entitled to a fair trail the same as anyone else is. If you don't like what we're doin', go on home. [men laughing] It's a good thing you got back, Steve. Maybe you can talk some sense to them locoed galoots over there. Oh, it'd only be a waste of time to try. His kind don't deserve nothin'. Higgins: We've got too many of these hombres... Gotta get this hombre out of here before sundown, gentlemen. I'm telling you now. You got everything straight? I sure have. Leave it to me. [dramatic music] Open up the door, sheriff, or we'll break it in! Better do as we say. We want Todd Wingate. We better go out and quiet that mob. Todd: Give me a gun and I'll help you stand 'em off. You've already caused enough trouble, Todd. All together, men, and straight on into that cell! Pull out that wheat-rack and use it for a battering ram! - Hey, come on. - Clear out of here, all of ya! First man who tries to pass us will end up with a load of buckshot. Don't let the judge bluff ya, men. We want Wingate, sheriff, and we're gonna get him! He's my prisoner and nobody's gonna take him outta here. Now get back! [dramatic music] I'm givin' you men till I count ten to clear out. One... two... three... [men clamoring] [intense music] Alright, put him in here. Sorry to do this to ya, gentlemen. - Make yourselves comfortable. - This is an outrage. Ah, shut up. Here's our man. Alright, get him out of there. Come on, we got a nice tree picked out for you, mister. [clamoring] [men clamoring] Prescott: Find what you're looking for, Lieutenant? A lot of people seem interested in my mail. Now hand over those letters. I guess there isn't much choice, Prescott. This explains how you knew the judge was expectin' to hear from Washington. You don't think your knowledge is gonna do you any good, do you? [clamoring] [dramatic music] Man 3: Murder him. Put it on him. String him up, boys! String him up! [gunshot] [men clamoring] Banjo: Get back! This is dynamite! Into the wagon! Quick! [gunshots] Giddap! Giddap! Giddap! [gunshots] Why, the whole thing's a frame-up. Come on, get your horses, men! [intense music] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [explosion] [explosion] [explosion] [gunshots] [explosion] [gunshots] Drew, you and Prescott are comin' back and face a federal court. You haven't got anything on us. Well, just to refresh your memory, I happen to be the man you shot the night you robbed the Express office. Well, maybe these letters will come in kinda handy at the trial. [instrumental music] [Johnny Bond singing "Starlight On The Prairie"] Starlight On the prairie Moonbeams Fill the sky Night winds On the prairie Croonin' Lullabies Goodbye, Donna. I'll let ya know how I like army life. I'll be waiting to hear from you, Todd. Will you be coming back after the war, Steve? A team of horses couldn't keep me away. Speakin' of horses, the sooner you send us them remounts, the sooner the war'll be over. - Well, goodbye, Donna. - Goodbye, boys, and good luck. So long. Ridin' Through the wastelands My dreams are all Of home Starlight On the prairie Guide me Safely home [instrumental music]
