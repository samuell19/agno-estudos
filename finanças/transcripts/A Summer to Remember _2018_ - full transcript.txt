You'll spend as little time in there as possible and as much time as you can with me in the ER. - It will be a good day today. Alright, we've got four riders, none of which have any idea what they're doing, but you guys will take good care of them, right? Like you always do. Let's begin the day. - [Jessica] There should be full labs on that one. - [Nurse] Okay. - [Nurse] Dr. Martin, Dr. Bailey was looking for you. - Okay, thank you. - And Dr. Murphy needs you to look at that EKG he sent you. - Oh, yeah, I was saving that for the train ride home. Pediatric patient in number four, how's our lollipop supply? - Well stocked. I'll bring it to him, but I need you to sign this. - And I need you to go, go, go. - Ah, Dr. Bailey. - Jessica, you were supposed to be on vacation by now. Don't make me pry that tablet out of your hands. - Okay, walking towards the door. - Do me a favor while you're in Fiji. Remember your priorities. - Decompress, unplug, spend time with family. - No. - Oh, right, the infamous honey cake . I won't show my face back here without it. Ava! - My new novel, I can't find it anywhere. - The one with the cupcake on the cover? I put it away. It was making me hungry. Here, let me help. - No, I've got it. It's okay. Oh, there it is. Wait, why are my sandals in here? - Oh, for the lovo. - The what? - The lovo, it's like a luau in Fiji. People dress up for those, at least they did when I was there. - Mom, you lived with a family. This is a big resort. Promise you'll be chill in this vacation. - Well, I can be more chill if I'm prepared. (doorbell rings) That must be Karen. Hey. I can't believe you made it all the way out here. You're supposed to be home with your feet up, romantic comedies on. - Well, I can't let you go on vacation without the right gear. Ta-da! - Oh, this is awesome! Oh, I can take pictures when we're snorkeling. - Anything for my favorite goddaughter. - I love you. - Here, come, sit down. - Okay, I have something for you too. - [Jessica] Oh. - Yeah. I stopped by the hospital to do my leave paperwork, heard some gossip. - Ooh, what did you hear? - Dr. Robertson won the Shilling fellowship. - That is fantastic. Wow, I've gotta text him. - Really? That's your first thought, send him a text. - Why wouldn't that... Oh. - Yes. - He's slated to be the new attending. Well, who's next in line? - Well, I hear it's not a done deal, but there's a definite contender. - Me? - Come on. You're a great doctor, and you get along with everyone. - A promotion would be a huge honor, but it kinda puts a crimp in my plan. - The private practice? - I'm serious about this, Karen. I was looking at office space last week. I could make my own hours and spend more time with Ava. If I was attending, I'd be in charge. There would be a pay raise, but the hours. - Hey, preaching to the choir. I'm not sure how long I'll last in the ER once this little man makes his appearance. - This little man looks like he's gonna make an appearance in my living room. - (chuckles) I know, right? How can I possibly have three weeks left. - When is David coming back? - They won't redeploy him until I'm 39 weeks. I'm telling you, pregnancy is tough, but it's a lot tougher when your husband's on a destroyer halfway across the world. - I can postpone my trip. No, I can't postpone the birth of my godson but... - No, no, no. You've had this planned for a year. I know how important Fiji was to you and Greg. He would have wanted you to share it with Ava. - Yeah. Well, it's time to focus on the future. Imagine how different life will be a month from now. - For all of us. (upbeat music) - [Attendants] Bula, Bula, Bula! - I take it that means hello. - Hello, goodbye, welcome, thank you, bless you, and probably a few others I'm forgetting. Bottom line, it's a good word to know. - [Attendant] Bula, welcome to (mumbles) Resort and Spa. - Thank you. (drums rumbling) - [Meli] Bula! - Bula. - Would you like a salu-salu? - Oh, no, that's very kind. I think I'll wait till happy hour. - It's not a cocktail. I was offering you a salu-salu, a flower lei. - Okay. Yeah, I guess my Fijian is a little rusty. Thank you. - May I take your welcome photo? - Ah, you know, she prefers to take pictures, not be in them. - Oh, I completely understand. I'm the same. Nice camera. - Thanks. - Oh, looks like my dad's ready to check you in. - Thank you. - Bula! - Bula! Danny. The flowers are a very nice touch. - Well, I'm glad you like them. Ms. Martin. Alright, so I see that we've got you in your private villa suite with your own backyard. - With pool and beach access. - See, she knows her stuff. Now will you be joining us for lovo on Thursday? - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Great. Oh, and we have an art and photography show later this week too. - Wow, well, we'll have to check that out. I don't about you, but I am ready to lounge. You grab your bag, and I'll get mine. Um... - Uh. (Jessica giggles) - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No problem. I see you have excellent taste in luggage. - As do you, doctor. Your luggage tag, AMA, San Diego. - Oh, right. I'm Jessica Martin, emergency medicine, Riverside Hospital. And this is my daughter, Ava. - Hi. - [Ava] Hi. - Trevor Copeland, thoracic surgery. - Oh, at the AMA, you were the... - The keynote speaker. - Right, you raised some fascinating issues in stent outcomes. If you've got time, I would love to talk... - Mom. - At some point. - Absolutely. Well, I'm around all week. So hopefully, I'll see you ladies around. - Okay, great. Okay. - Okay, bye. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to talk shop, but in the thoracic surgery world, he's... - Mom, your nerd is showing. - Okay. Oh, look at this! Our vacation has officially started. Oh, wow! - Oh, mom, you weren't kidding about the view! - See, Ava, some people would say that downloading a map of the hotel, requesting a specific room might be overkill but... (loud thudding) Excuse me. Hi. I'm Jessica. This is Ava, my daughter. We just arrived. - Oh, great. I'm Will. - Oh, uh, I didn't realize there was a construction project going on. - Oh, I wouldn't exactly call this a project. - Okay, well, it's a little noisy. And you know, we got here to vacation at this vacation resort. - Oh, is that what this is? - Well, we have a heavy schedule of activities tomorrow. We'll be out of the room. You could hammer then. - Ooh, no can do. This is a pretty urgent project exclusively for this suite. Besides, I'm just about done. - May I ask what it is? - It's a, uh, it's a hammock. - Oh, mom, let him put it up. I can read, feel the breeze, nap. - Yeah, so she's got the right idea. - Okay, we'll head out to the pool and... - Let me get my suit. - Great. Well, thanks. I'll throw in some free lovo tickets for your trouble. - Oh, should I tell the front desk that Will the hammock guy threw 'em in? - Will, the co-owner works better. - Ava, why don't you put your camera down and look. Just experience things firsthand. - [Ava] Mom, you don't get it. I have to be ready. - For what? - [Ava] For when I see my perfect picture. - How will you know when that is? - I don't know, but I'll know it when I see it. And every time I look at it, I'll think of this place and dad. - Well, that's a worthy goal, but I'm pretty sure he would also want you to have fun. And you don't always need to have an objective. - Tell you what. I'll put down the camera if you put down the phone. - I bet I can go longer without my phone than you can without your camera. Let's go for a walk. - Doing a year abroad here, it must have been incredible. - Oh, yeah, the people and the culture. Meeting your dad wasn't so bad either. - It must have been so romantic. - Not the first time we met. It was on the shuttle from the airport. But after that, yes. - God, it's just so not like you. Eloping, here, a month before you graduated from college? - Marrying your Dad was one of the best decisions I ever made. I got you out of the bargain. - I just still can't believe you guys were here, at this resort, together. - Yeah, it was a little smaller back then but they still, you know, they had snorkeling and horseback riding. Your dad had a favorite bench on one of the reef cliffs. We used to watch the sunset and pitch what our life would be like when we moved here. - You were really gonna come back here for good? - Mm-hmm, yeah, I was gonna open a clinic. Your dad was gonna buy a boat, take tourists out on fishing trips. - Well, why didn't you? - A little thing called med school and of course, parenthood. But I promised your dad that I would bring you here one day, and here we are. We can go snorkeling in his honor. - And hike? - Mm-hmm. - And horseback riding? - Yeah. - And paddle boarding? - I'm not quite coordinated enough for that one, but I will cheer you on. - New adventures, mom. - Its an adventure just watching you, cutie. (thunder rumbles) Whoo, come on! We got this! Let's get a bite to eat while the storm passes. - [Trevor] Dr. Martin. - Yeah. - [Trevor] Come in out of the rain. - Oh. Uh, sure. - You girls are in full vacation mode. I've only just unpacked, checked in with my office, and discover kalua pork nachos. - [Jessica] Oh, yum. - Oh, and Peter, this is Ava and Jessica. - [Peter] Bula. - Peter is famous for his smoothies. - So what's it gonna be, Ava? Mango banana pineapple or pineapple mango banana? - I'll have banana mango pineapple. - Good choice. But it's really all about the garnishes. Would you care to take a stab? Pun intended. If you two make those, I'll make you some smoothies. - Okay. - So what have you ladies got planned while you're here? - Oh, just some fun, try some new things and chill, as my daughter would say. - Chill, yeah. People use that word on me a lot too. The head of research at my university actually mandated that I come on this vacation. - Oh, you came alone? - It was a last minute decision, didn't have time to coordinate a friend. And well, it gives me a chance to make new friends. What about you? - Oh, just the two of us. - Like two peas in a pod. - Yes, hoping this vacation helps her come out of her pod just a little. - Mom. - Well, if it helps, I was thinking about doing some horseback riding in a couple of days if you wanted to join. - Ooh, horseback riding is on our list. What do you think, yeah? - Mm-hmm. - We might join you. - Great. Well, to new friends. - Cheers. - Cheers. (upbeat music) - Mom, my camera, I left it in the room. Do I have time to go get it? - Hey, what happened to our bet? - Mom, how am I supposed to get my perfect picture? - Okay, go get your camera. Get your shot. I'll miss at the restaurant in a few. There's just something I wanted to do. - Thanks. (wheels creaking) - I'm sorry. Hi. - Hi, Will. - I am really sorry to disturb you again. I'm just trying to get this to maintenance, and usually, there's nobody out here. - You do a lot of physical work for an owner. - Yeah, well, I mean when we took this place over and we knew that in order to make it the best, everybody's gotta get their hands dirty. You know, everybody does every job. We're a family. - Well, it shows, and I respect that. - Thank you. This reef lookout, it's one of the hidden gems. - Yeah, it was my husband's favorite when we were here an eternity ago. I thought coming back here would make me sad, but I actually feel an odd sense of calm. - Hmm, the locals call that maravu. - I remember maravu. Uh, it's peace, right? - Yeah, yeah, the special kind of peace you can only find in the islands. You know it? - I used to. - Well, I'll leave you to it. And I hope you find it again. - Me too. (wheels creaking) - I'm sorry. (Jessica sighs) - Mom, this trip is about new... - Adventures, I know, embracing the possibility. But I'm checking on Karen. Okay, okay, this is me relaxing. (phone buzzing) Oh, come on. It could be Karen. - Okay. - Oh, she's doing okay, but she doesn't know anything yet. - Anything about what? - Oh, this thing at work. It's nothing. - Well, if it's nothing, can it wait till tomorrow? Unless you wanna admit I already won the bet. Besides, you can't have your phone in the water. - There. - How can this possibly be the same ocean we have at home? You can see the bottom. - Yeah, and everything in it. I'm still getting used to that. - Hey. - [Jessica] Hey, hi. - Getting an early start. - Yeah, adjusting to the time change. - Well, I'm Lani, one of the owners. - Oh, I'm Jessica. This is my daughter, Ava. - Hey, nice to meet you, Ava. - You ever get used to this, just waking up and looking out at this everyday? - No. (chuckles) That's the beautiful thing about the islands. The ocean's always reshaping them. And I'd like to think it does the same to us. Either of you paddle board? - Not me. - Nope. - Well, my early morning class got canceled, so maybe today's the day we change that. - Oh. - Okay, get back up again. Now feel the board before you stand, weight centered, feet apart. - Ava, maybe you should try this on the dock just so you don't fall again, you know. - Mom, you're making me nervous. - Well, it's just your feet aren't really wide enough. If you just... - Kids this age don't want anyone watching. - Ava, would you be okay if I took a hike? - You said it. - [Lani] Okay, up again. - Oh! - Oh! - Hi. - Sorry. I was just looking for the entrance to the hiking trail. - Oh, well, if you put down the map, you might see that it's right here. - Oh. - Is that your to-do list? - Yeah, I taped it to my map. Just kidding. - I'm relieved to hear that. Well, I'm headed to Vanatua. You're welcome to come along if you like. - Oh, is it far? Ava's at a paddle boarding lesson. - No, you should be back by the time it ends. - Are you sure you don't mind? - I don't mind at all. Just one condition. - You know, on second thought, there's a hat weaving demo... - The condition is that we leave right now. - Okay, wait up! - [Will] There you go. - [Jessica] You know, it's weird. I don't remember seeing jungle hike to Vanatua on the resort's calendar. - Well, that's because it's not on the resort's calendar. Today's my day off. - Will! Ah, you should have told me. I'm sure you don't wanna Sherpa around some guest on your day off. - Well, then don't act like a guest and we should be fine. - Alright. What does a guest act like? - Well, they're all different, but they all have one thing in common, an agenda. Even if that agenda is to come here and relax, they wanna measure it with check boxes and lists. - Ah, yes. Well, lists can be useful. - Yeah, at a supermarket, maybe. Look, there's a lot to be said about just spontaneity, that feeling of not knowing what's gonna happen. - Yeah, work with me in the ER for a week. - Oh, you're a doctor. - Yeah, you'll find that not knowing what's gonna happen is not all that it's cracked up to be. - Okay, that's true, but if you plan too much, then you just never get to experience wonder. Wonder. - Whoo, look at that core! You got this. Remember, you're in control. Big circle around the lagoon, okay? - Okay. - She's up already. That's got to be a record. - Huh, this one didn't need to get up. She just needed to know that the world keeps spinning even if she fell. - Well, it looks like she got a good dose of that too. (Lani laughs) You got a gift, Lani. You just know what people need. - Well, isn't that why you married me, totoka? - No, I married you because of your secret honey cake recipe. (laughs) Hey, I heard Frigates is 10-foot. You wanna grab the board and catch a few? - Oh, I'd love to, but I've got two more lessons after this. - Oh, I wonder if Will's keen. - Oh, sure. He just headed over to Vanatua. - Oh, I bet I can catch up with him. He might be game. - I might hold off. Meli told me that she saw Jessica, Ava's mom, join him on his hike. - The lady from Villa 16. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, on his day off? - Uh-huh. - Hmm, Will might be breaking his golden rule. - Well, as you know, this island, anything is possible. (Lani and Danny laugh) - So in the interest of not knowing what's gonna happen, I'm not gonna ask where we're going. However, if you're so inclined to give me a hint, now would be a great time. - How's this for a hint? - Wow. (dramatic music) - I know, right? - [Jessica] Wow! - Are you going in? - Oh, no. I don't know what kind of microbes are in there. (Jessica laughs) - I just did a little investigation. No microbes! - Okay, I'm going up to my knees. - [Will] Okay. - Okay. Alright. - Keep going. Be careful over there because the rocks are a little bit... - [Jessica] Whoa! - Are you alright? - Yes. I'm gonna go check out the waterfall. - Okay, don't say I didn't warn you. There's a lot more microbes over that way. - Okay, I will say this again. That hike was pretty amazing. Thank you for working on your day off. - Oh, that did not feel like work at all. - And for not treating me like a guest. - Well, thanks for not acting like one. Where's that list, by the way? Oh, and you forgot this. - Isn't there some sort of island tradition which side to put that on? - Yeah, but it's kind of old fashioned. I mean I'm sure you don't wanna... - Try me. - Okay, well, right side means that you're available. And left side means that your heart is taken. - Good to know. - Jessica, hi. - [Jessica] Hi! - I hope you don't mind. I went ahead and booked the three of us into horseback riding tomorrow morning at the beach. - Oh, that sounds great. I think Ava will be thrilled. - [Trevor] I see paddle boarding was a big success. - Yeah. From the looks of it, I'd say she'll try it again. - Great. So how was your morning? - It was full of surprises. Yeah, one of the owners took me up to a waterfall. - Waterfall? I'd sign up for that. - I don't think it was on the menu. - Actually, speaking of menus, I'd love to take you and Ava to dinner at some point. - Oh, yeah, I just have to check with the chief. - Great. The flower's a nice touch. - Oh. What's that for? - To add to your collection. I'll see you in the morning. - [Jessica] Okay. - [Ava] Come on! Which one's mine? - A guide's supposed to meet us here soon. - [Will] Jessica! - [Jessica] Oh. - [Will] Hey! - [Jessica] Hey! - I didn't know you were riding today. - Yeah. - You guys know each other? - Well, Will showed me around yesterday. Will, you remember Ava. - Of course! How's that hammock working out? - Well, let's just say it's hard to get her to sleep inside the room. - (chuckles) Well, that is what it's there for. So Ava, you ever been on a horse before? - Nope. - No problem. How about you guys? - It's been a few years. - More enthusiasm than skill. (phone buzzes) - Well, for starters, you need to talk to your horse a little bit. - Talk to the horse? - Yeah, yeah, so they get to know your voice. So that way, on the ride, if you need to correct them, you're the voice of a friend, not of a stranger, alright. Now this beauty right here, this is Mahina. She was born right here on the property, and I trained her myself. She's gonna be yours today. Ava, you wanna come say hi? - Hi, Mahina. I'm Ava. (chuckles) I think we're gonna be friends. - I think she likes you. (phone buzzes) Jessica, you're gonna be with Vosa. (phone buzzes) - Vosa, what does that mean, sweet? - Trouble. She's always stopping for treats. - Just like you, mom. - Oh, yeah, guilty. See, she understands. - Trevor, are you joining us? - Absolutely, yeah, sorry. (Trevor grunts) - [Will] Oh, man. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me see. - [Trevor] So stupid. - Is there a clinic here? - Dr. Chaudhry is about 20 minutes down the road. - No need. We've got a doctor right here. - Yeah, is there an emergency first aid kit? - Yeah, Lani does in the main kitchen. Careful! - Actually, where's my phone? - Here. It looks like it's in one piece. - Could you check my last message? - Run full labs on the control group. - Could you add by the end of the day and just press send? - You don't wanna say anything about being on vacation? - Ava. - Well, Ava, doctors are never truly on vacation. - [Will] Alright, careful. - Alright, a stitch or two should fix you right up. - Dr. Copeland, I'm Lani, one of the owners. How are you doing? - Well, my pride took a bit of a tumble, but Dr. Martin here seems to be patching me up. - Jessica, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. We've been trying to hire a doctor, and it's taking longer than we'd expected. Please let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. (phone buzzes) Alright, your phone is blowing up. Is everything okay? - It's just a case study. My assistant is covering for me. I should probably call him back. - Alright, well, go ahead. - Sorry, I'll catch up with you a bit later. - Okay. - Where's he going? - Oh, work thing. - Oh, well, I mean if he's tied up, I can still take you and Ava for a ride if you want. - Oh, thanks. I should probably wait for him. - Of course. So you two work together or... - No, we actually just met yesterday. - Oh. - Yeah. - Well, this place is known for bringing people together. It's part of why people come back here. Maybe it's even why you came back. - Hmm, Ava and I came back to keep a promise and hopefully, achieve maravu. But I have a list, and this was not on the list. So I should probably revise it, or else I'll never achieve... - Maravu. - Right. - Well, good luck. - Thanks. Thanks for this. - [Ava] Do you know if they have paddle boarding lessons back home? - You might need a wetsuit, but we can probably arrange something. I'm so proud of you, getting up after just one lesson. - Well, Lani's not like any teacher I've ever had. She's pretty hands off, but somehow she... - Gets you to figure it out on your own? I noticed. Peter, I see a lot of new items on the smoothie menu. - Yup, we've got pineapple, fresh coconuts, paw paw, and lilikoi. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go sit by the pool. - I'll bring our smoothies out. Something catch your eye, Peter? You want my professional opinion as a doctor? You've fallen hard. - Well, doctors are bound by confidentiality, right? - We also give a lot of advice. - So I've been working here for like two months. - And? - And our conversations are limited to hi, bye, Bula, and that four-top needs more ketchup. - I may have a diagnosis. You're talking about work too much. - I am. Is that a big no-no? - Sometimes when you're trying to get to know someone and you only show them that one side of yourself, it makes it harder to see the real person. - Wait, so what should I say? - Well, if I told you then, she wouldn't get a chance to see who you really are, wouldn't she? - [Peter] Oh, come on. - Let me know how it goes. - Hi! I see you've met Peter. - Is it that obvious? (Lani laughs) How's your doctor friend? Is he really okay? - He's almost 100%. And I think he'll put his phone down next time he's around horses. - Oh, that's a relief. Ah, I see you've found my favorite island accessory. - Oh, these. Yes, they're incredible. They come in so many colors. - It's nice to have choices. - Yeah, I suppose it is. - I'm serious. I'm gonna try every flavor Peter has before we leave. - Hopefully, not all in the same smoothie. - Now there's an idea. - Hey, I need to tell you something. When I was talking to Karen earlier, it wasn't just about the baby. - Oh? - I'm up for a new job. - Well, what kind of new job? - Attending physician. I'll be in charge of all the ER doctors. - So they'd be doing all the work. - Well, not exactly. - But you'd work less. - Well, it's actually more responsibility so I... - [Ava] And more work. - It's a huge opportunity. - And so is having your own practice. - I haven't made any decisions yet. I just, I felt I should let you know. - Well, if, if, if that's where things are going, then I guess we're just gonna have to make every second of this vacation count. - Hi! - [Jessica] Hello. - Would you like your photograph as a memento of this evening? - Yeah. - Sure. - Ava, isn't that the same camera you use? - I've seen you taking pictures. This is the Canon 5D Mark III. - I have a D60. - Excellent choice, very versatile. - What lens are you using tonight? - My favorite is a 50, but I use the 85 for candid shots. People get nervous when I get too close. - Well, Meli, how long have you worked here? - All my life. My mom and dad own Yanuca Cove with Will. - It must be so cool living here. - It really is, but it's also cool being a photographer here. I'm leading a youth hike tomorrow. You and your camera wanna come? - Tomorrow? - Sounds like a lot of fun, Ave. - But I won't know anyone. - Well, you won't at first, but you will by the end. - Uh, I'll think about it. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey, Alisi, this is for Villa 16. Can you add this to the breakfast orders for tomorrow? - Villa 16? Isn't that that doctor? What's her name? - Yeah, Jessica. She seemed pretty cool. - Alright, guys, okay. We went on a hike. It was no big deal. - Not at all, though that's a fairly romantic hike. Don't you think, Lani? - It depends on the company. - On second thought, I think I'll go enjoy this in my cottage alone. Okay. Alright. She's not your average guest. And yes, spending time with her, it's been easy for me to forget the three little words that have kept me out of heaps of trouble. - Three little words? - No dating guests. (Danny laughs) And with that, I bid you good night. Good night. - [Ava] I'll be back in a second. - Ava, I think you'll be proud of me. - You threw away your list? - No, but I revised it to give us more flexibility. The more I think about it, the more I think I need to give us some time for spontaneity, time to, what's this? - My 65-mil macro, my telephoto and my... - No, I know what it is. I mean why are you packing it? - Who was it who was just talking about spontaneity? - I don't know. I woke up thinking about dad and how much you talked about the island and thought maybe I should actually go on that hike for him. - And for you. Just think of the flowers and the birds and... - Mom, you don't have to oversell it. I'm going, okay? - Meli, hi. Is it too late for Ava to join you? - Not at all. I packed an extra snack in case you changed your mind. - You're gonna be okay without me. - You'll be back before lunch. - Well, I just don't want you to be bored, you know, sitting around waiting for me. - Don't worry about me. - Don't call or text or Skype the hospital while I'm gone. Go do something fun. - Promise. Sunshine, fresh air, decompressing, unplugging. Go have a great time. - [Ava] Hi. - Where did you get all of these knots in your mane, young lady? What have you been up to, huh? - [Jessica] So this is what they mean by horse whispering. - [Will] Hey! - Hey. - No, I wouldn't pretend to have that kind of power over any creature, horse or otherwise. - Do you think she's up for a ride? - Well, that depends on who's asking. - Well, no one, just maybe a guest you might have mentioned a make-up lesson to. - I'm a man of my word, but she can be a little unpredictable. - Well, then she sounds perfect. - Is this a lesson in riding or in spontaneity? - Maybe a little of both. - Yeah? Well, when's the next opening in your schedule? - I don't know, now-ish? - Is that your list? - Hey, at least it's not taped to my map. - That's true. You're making progress. That's good. You ready? - Yes. - Okay. Come on. Are you ready? Look at that, you're doing great. Just ride with a looser hand. Yeah. Okay, well, not quite that loose. Most people really hold on tight because they're afraid but a free rein lets her know that you trust her. - Okay. - Okay? - Alright. - Wanna get her going? - There you go. Come on. Yeah, nice. - How long have you been riding? - Oh, man, since I was a kid. - I grew up next to a horse farm in Tennessee. - Oh, this is a long way from Tennessee. - Yeah. I went to college in San Diego and got into surfing. Came out here for a context and then kinda lost my ticket home. - I bet it's a little more complicated than that. - Hmm, well, I met Danny and Lani, everything changed. I mean we realized we had the chance to turn this place into a kind of resort where we could work everyday and never look back. Now how about you? You had your honeymoon here? - Yeah, I did my last year of college here on the island, met another student, and I went home a married woman. - Ah, so you got a little practice in spontaneity. - Yeah, at a time when it was a lot easier to be spontaneous. Yeah, back to the States, Greg got a great job. I got into med school, and we had Ava. Anyway, dreams deferred. - I don't know. You got a job where you get to help people. You got a daughter who loves you and adores you. It doesn't sound like you deferred anything. - Do you have kids? - I thought I would. I was married for a couple of years once, but like you said, dreams deferred. - So you do have some regrets. - Not about living here. - And you never think about going home? - Oh, this is home. - I could get used to this. - I'm glad to hear that. Hey, what do you say for the ride home, we take it up a notch. - Uh, excuse me? - Yeah, come on. You got this. Come on, come on! Here we go! (Jessica laughs) Hi-ya! - Oh, look at this one. - It's called a banana skipper. Sometimes I find them in my yard. - Oh, it must be amazing living here. - Can't complain. That's my mom. Excuse me. - [Meli] Can I see? - Yeah. - Ava, thank you for showing me those. She usually deletes her pictures without letting me see. - I don't usually like them. - These are great, Ava. In fact, there are a couple I'd like you to submit to the art show. - Really? - I got a photo printer you can use. - Thanks, but all those people looking at my work. - Admiring your work. - You don't know that, mom. - Hey, Ava, wanna hit the ice cream carts down by the infinity pool with me? - Yeah. Oh, can I? I didn't know if we had plans. - Oh, Trevor invited us to lunch. - To talk about his study? - I can't promise he won't. So I'll give him your regrets and I'll find you down there later. - You're the best! - She's usually shy. New situations aren't always easy for her. - I wouldn't have guessed it on the hike. She was full of questions, took tons of pictures. - That's music to my ears. - I hope you had a fun morning too. - I did. I went horseback riding. - The group lesson with my dad? - No, with Will. - Sorry I'm late. One of the study sponsors called and I lost track of time. - No, you're on vacation. You're supposed to lose track of time. - Where's Ava? - She made a new friend. - Well, if she's anything like her mom, I'm sure it comes easily to her. So what's the plan for the day? - I do not have one. - Am I sensing an attitude adjustment, Dr. Martin? - Yeah, nothing quite that dramatic, just, you know, a desire to be in the moment. - I don't blame you. It's a great moment to be in. - Meli here is helping mentor my daughter's photography career. - I wear a lot of hats at this resort. Can I get you a drink? - Best question anyone's asked me all day. - Meli, would you ask Peter what he'd suggest? He always knows what ingredients are freshest. - Mm-hmm. - Is there something going on here I should know about? - Just a little experiment. - And the results? - It's too early to tell, but I may have successfully slowed down the service here. And you know, I just like to help people. Isn't that why we're doctors? - Honestly, I love the puzzle, solving the mystery. - Hmm, yeah, and you know, leaving people in a better place than where you found them. - Ah, that's the appeal of the ER, although I do hear a hint of family practitioner in your tone. - Ah, yes, the patient does present with conflicting symptoms, doctor. What do you suggest? - Extensive followups, personalized care. - Hmm. - You were right about it here. I do feel different in a good way. - Well, I'm glad you like it here as much as I do. - But time's gone by so fast, and I still haven't found my perfect picture. - You know, sometimes you go on vacation thinking you need one thing, and you end up finding something else. - Not helping. (Jessica chuckles) - You'll find it, sweetheart. Listen, I want you to know, if I end up taking this job, we will still take trips like this. - You don't have to say that. - But I mean it. I realized that I often carry the stress of the hospital home with me, and that's not fair to you. And I could get used to chilling out a little more. I see my journey of self discovery has clearly put you to sleep. - Hmm? - Nothing. Get some sleep. I had a little too much iced tea. I'm gonna take a walk around the hotel, get some of this energy out. - Sounds like a plan. - Hey! - Peter! Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where I could get some chamomile tea this late at night. - There's still some folks in the kitchen who'll be happy to help you out. So I made some real progress with Meli today thanks to you. I could even say I'm officially in the friend zone. - See. - Which leads me to my next question. How do I get out of it? - Same way you got in. Baby steps. - [Lani] Come on. You're not getting this until you tell us. - [Will] There's nothing to say. - [Lani] Come on, admit it. - Admit what? - That you are full on breaking your rule. - I don't know what you guys are talking about. - Jessica! I saw your group ride today. - Group ride? It looked to me like it was just you two. - [Danny] Don't tell me that's not a date. - She came to the stables looking for a make-up session. There's a big difference between going on date with somebody and then just spending a little time. - So you have no feelings for her. (gasps) What did he say last night? - The three words I live by, no dating guests. (Lani laughs) - That is not what I sound like. Second of all, nothing escapes you two, absolutely nothing. - Oh, hi, Jessica. - Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any chamomile tea, would you? - Jessica! Jessica. Look, I don't know exactly what you heard back there. - Well, you don't have to explain. - No, no, no, I really would like to explain. Please, I really just, just, just give me one minute. One minute, I promise. - Okay, okay. So why are we here? - Best view in the house. - Uh, wow. Ah, this deserves more than just a minute. - Yeah, pretty spectacular, right? - Yeah, wow. - [Will] You don't see stars like this in Portland, do you? - Hmm, well. Still doesn't distract me from my curiosity though. - No dating guests. - Seems like a pretty strict rule for a guy working in a resort. - Hmm, well, I call it a rule, but really, it's more of a defense mechanism. - Hmm, sounds like you dated a guest. - Married one, actually. It was a long time ago, when the three of us first took over this resort. And I thought we were in love, but in retrospect, I think she was more in love with an idea that being here on this island with me meant that her entire life was gonna be a vacation. And then when reality set in, well, island paradise just wasn't enough. I wasn't enough. - Hmm, well, I'm sorry. Losing someone is tough. It can close you down, make you get stuck in the past. - It's funny though. The last few days, I have been more focused on the present, maybe even dabbled in the future. - Uh-oh, is your rule in danger of being broken? (phone buzzes) - Perhaps, that is a sign that I shouldn't answer that. - It's my friend, Karen. She is pregnant. I have to call her. - Oh, sure. (phone rings) - Oh, it's connecting. - [Karen] Jess, thanks for calling. - Hey, of course. What's going on? - Karen, it's so cool here. I went paddle boarding, and mom went to a waterfall. - Karen, wait. Is that a gown? Are you okay? - Everything's fine-ish. - What do you mean fine-ish? - The baby's just a little further along than we thought. - Are you having the baby like right now? - (laughs) Ava, honey, suffice it to say you would know if that was happening. - How did the ultrasound go? - Well, he's a strong, healthy boy. He might be here a little sooner than we thought. - How soon? - They wanna induce Thursday night. - But David will barely be able to get back in time. - Which is why I want a second opinion. David only has two weeks of leave time. It'll be a shame for him to spend them on a false alarm. But Dr. Shapiro can't see me till Thursday morning. - Okay, well, let me know when you hear something. I wanna be there, okay, Karen. - Me too, but down the hall, like we talked about. - I'll take either of you anyway I can get you. Now I don't wanna keep you any longer. Go, enjoy your vacation. - Love you. - Trevor said he'll meet us here to go snorkeling. Maybe I got the time wrong. - [Trevor] Uh-huh, okay. - What was it you were telling me about talking about work? - Well, just go into the control group. Go into the control group and adjust the P values. It's really simple, Hal. Okay, I gotta go. Bye. Ladies, I am so sorry. I'm gonna have to bail on snorkeling. I got this... - Work thing. - Yeah, how did you know? - Wild guess. - Yeah, sorry. Thank you. - Come on, Ava. We've got an ocean to explore. - Hey, Will. - Hey, you two. Hey, Jessica, how's your friend in Portland doing? - Oh, she's fine-ish, and her baby's getting impatient. - That's not bad news. That's just babies. - We're going snorkeling. I can hardly wait. - I see that. I like your rig. Now if you wanna get some great shots of clown fish and lots of other types of fish, you gotta go to the soft coral reserve, okay? It's beautiful. - Soft coral reserve, is that close? Can you show us where it is? - Ava, will is working. - I'm in charge of activities today. Snorkeling is an activity. You two are guests. So showing you guys the reef might just fit into my job description. Let's do it. Come on. - Okay. ♪ We can go to our favorite place ♪ ♪ Feel the sunlight on our face ♪ ♪ Where the world makes sense ♪ There's no consequence ♪ We'll light up the night ♪ Take me ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Because I know, I know you're still ♪ ♪ Holding your breath ♪ Take me ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me ♪ Take me far away ♪ Take me far away - Wow, those colors were like neon. - Mom, we have to get a saltwater camera when we get back. - Oh, yeah. See, I was thinking we could start with a fishbowl. - I don't know, Jess. A fishbowl might not be big enough for this. - Well, Will just got you an upgrade. - I'm gonna go put this up on the shore before I lose it. Best souvenir ever! (Jessica chuckles) - Oh, don't tell me you found something else. This hypothetical fish tank is gonna fill my entire living room. - It's amazing to me how the ocean can take like a hunk of rock and then tumble it into something so beautiful. - It looks like a heart. - People come here from all over the world, and they all say they just feel different. They feel freer. They feel more relaxed. Dream bigger, you know. Some people stay a week and they never leave. The island definitely changes everyone. I hope the Yanuca Resort will always have a place in your heart. - (shrieks) Is that a jellyfish? - Okay, jellyfish season doesn't happen until about 10 days after the full moon. You're good. - Okay. - Yeah. - Then you could probably put me down then, huh? - I don't know. There's gotta be one and two stragglers, you know. - Hmm, stragglers. - Yeah. They can be dangerous. - Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm. I got you though. I got you. Here we go. - Ava, you ready? Hey, why are you wearing your dress? The big feast isn't until tomorrow. - I had something to dress up for. I was actually wrapping this. - You didn't need to get me a gift. - I wanted to. - Okay. Let's see. Your butterfly. - Yes, sandalwood. Got it in the gift shop. - Honey, I don't think there's anything that can make me more proud. - Anything? - Ava, why are we here? - You'll see. - Ava. This is you. What? Oh. - Looks like the reviews from the local photographers are overwhelmingly positive. - Ava. - Will, this place has really done wonders for her. - Yeah, don't chalk it all up to location. I hear she's got a pretty incredible mom. - Mom, I sold one. - What? Congratulations! - You guys warming up for charades? - Yeah, that might be a better name for it. Alright, it shouldn't take long. Trevor, Ava's work is in the art show. Can this wait until later? - It'll just take a minute. - Okay. - I just wanted to apologize about the snorkeling trip and all the interruptions. - It's no problem at all. - What's this for? - Jessica, you deserve the best, something planned, not something just pulled off a tree. - I'm not sure I understand. - There's been a security breach at the university, and my study data may have been compromised. - Oh, that's terrible. - Yeah, it's not something I can handle remotely, so I head back tonight. The thing is I'm not ready to say goodbye to you. San Francisco next month. - [Jessica] Trevor, I... - And I know that it's last minute, but it would be a great networking opportunity and a chance for us to get to know each other. - Listen, Trevor. Look, I appreciate the offer, but it's just not gonna happen right now. I wish you all the best, and I'll keep an eye out for your next article. - Yeah. (phone buzzes) There's my ride. Okay, bye. - [Jessica] Bye. - And I hope you find what you're looking for. - Me too. - [Danny] Waiting for the perfect wave feels like forever, doesn't it? - You know, when it comes, it's a bit of a mystery. - Yeah, all you see is the beginning of the wave. And in a split second, you gotta make about a million snap decisions about how it's gonna play out. Did I take off too early? Did I take off too late? Is it strong enough to get me all the way to the shore? - Or will it pummel me so badly into the reef that I'll never surf again? - Oh, snap! You got my metaphor. - Yeah, it wasn't super subtle, man. - The point is you're in a beautiful wave. Enjoy the ride. - And what happens if someone else drops in on my wave? - The doctor guy. He left last night. He wasn't too happy. Not that that's what you're talking about. (upbeat music) - So when you first moved here, did you have any idea how different it would be? - Well, living here was actually easy. It was going back home that was hard. There was just something about the beauty and nature and physicality. It's like living moment to moment, very alive. (Ava laughs) Are you laughing at me, Ava Grace? - I just can't picture you without your daily plan, your weekly plan, your five-year plan. You sound like you miss it. - Yeah, maybe I'll move back here when I retire. - That's like a million years away. Why would you wait till then? - You have to be realistic. I'm a doctor. I'm a mom. - That's Will and Dan. - That doesn't look good. What happened? - I got caught in the lip, went over the fall. - And that never happens. - Lucky for me, Will saw, and I'm sure he's already posted the video. - Do you hear this? This is what I get for rescuing this guy. - Oh, rescue. You call that a rescue. - Alright, the good news is it's a textbook dislocation. The bad news is it's a textbook dislocation, which means it has to be relocated. - Oh, that's not the first time. Doc Chaudhry, he just pops it back in. - Yeah, Doc Chaudhry who lives 20 minutes down a very bumpy road. - Well, I'd settle for Doc Martin if she's seeing patients. - Oh, subtle, huh? - Okay. - Mm-hmm, okay. - Okay. - This won't hurt a bit. The Meli. - Hmm, we'll take a couple of those and a smoothie, please. - Yeah, I'm just curious. What inspired the name? - Just a one of a kind girl I've gotten to know lately. - Peter, that's very flattering. - It's not flattery. It's the truth. I'll make one. You'll see. - There is this one problem. I don't like coconut. - Oh. Well, I can change the recipe. - To tell you the truth, I'm more of a beer person. My favorite is from Vanasuva brewery. You've been there? - The one in town? - You're not gonna throw him a line here? - He's got this. - I've heard of it. What time do they close? - 11:30. - I'll take you after the lovo tonight, my treat. - You're on. - It looks like you've mastered my recipe. Fresh honey cakes as thanks for rescuing my husband. I feel like you should have a timecard here. You've been working too hard. - Okay, well, that shoulder took all of about 13 seconds. But getting the chance to cook with the master chef, that is payment above and beyond. (Lani chuckles) Let's see, okay. Mmm. - Mmm, I know, right? - I didn't think that could be any more delicious. - I try to serve them straight out of the oven, slows down the whole meal. Hungry people are grumpy people. - Okay, thank you for sharing your secret with me. Speaking of, mango cloud cake? - Hey, we don't know each other that well. - Happy hour started early. - Hey, we've been working very hard. If you're going to mock us, get out of my kitchen. - Honey cakes? - Yes, Lani shared her secret with me. I took a blood oath and everything. - I don't believe it. - Well, there's more new evidence right here. - Oh. - Sugar. - [Danny and Lani] Ooh. - Uh-huh, it really happened. - Yup. - Wow, it looks good. Cut me a piece. I want some. - Okay, come on. Are you ready? (laid back music) (percussion music) (men sing in foreign language) - [Performers] Bula! (crowd cheers) - That was so good! - That was so good! - You learned that so quickly! That was amazing! - Will, this whole thing was amazing. I don't know how you guys put this show on every week. - Oh, this whole production is all Danny and Lani and Meli, except for the recipe tasting, 'cause somebody's gotta do that. - Well, yeah. (chuckles) - What did you think? - [Will] Yeah. - Wow, wow. - I thought I couldn't like anything better than taro wrapped in banana leaves. Then I had the pork wrapped in banana leaves. - Ava, honey, I think she meant the show. (laughs) - Hey, I'll take that. I didn't cook all of this, but they are my recipes. And I don't shy away from a compliment. - Well, this is incredible, Lani. - No, you're incredible for all that you've done for us. Who's gonna patch everyone up when you leave? - Guys, I owe you an apology. Normally, I do a spectacular solo fire dance. - [Will] Spectacular? - Yes, but with one arm, it's a fire hazard. (group laughs) Jessica, thank you for snapping me back into place, literally. - Are you feeling better? - Yeah, I still gotta take it easy over the week. Did you talk to Lani? - About what? - About your doctor's orders? I can't do any cooking, or cleaning, or errand running, or shopping, or working. - Where is this coming from? - Oh, this is nothing, Jessica. He needs bed rest when he stubs his toe. - Well, glad I could help. - It only cost Lani her most secret recipe. - Jessica took an oath to take it to her grave. - Honestly, we're so used to having you guys around. Don't be surprised if your flights are accidentally canceled. - Well, don't be surprised if I don't bat an eye. I actually wish that we could stay here. - You know, we've been interviewing doctors this week, and there's only one thing we can agree upon, is that we wish they were more like you. - Wow, that almost sounds like a formal job offer. - Do you want it to be? - Mom, if we could stay here, we could... - Honey, moving is a big deal. Moving out of the country is a really big deal. - I'm sorry. We didn't mean to push it. - But we're serious. You guys are part of the family here, and we don't say that everyday. - Well, a serious offer requires some serious thought. But hopefully, after I wake up from my food coma. - A little announcement. As part of our evening festivities, we have scheduled a viewing of Blue Crush in the outdoor theater. Anyone? - Go ahead. I'll catch up with you later. Is it the firelight, the moon, the music? - The company? - I wish I could just bottle this night so I could have it forever. - The good times get us through the tough times. - Well, if that's the case, then I should stock up on a bunch before I go home. - Is it that chaotic? - Hmm, my best friend is having a baby. I'm up the biggest job of my life. I work 60 hours a week. I don't know. Things are completely under control. - Is there a way you could maybe take it down a notch? - Hmm, yeah, I tried that before I left. Opening up a private practice, that would give me time to focus on what's important. But then I found out that I might be up for attending physician, which would be a huge promotion. - Well, there isn't anything wrong with ambition as long as you're going after what you really want. - What I really want is for me and Ava to be happy with each other and ourselves. I just hope I can do that and still be attending. - After what I've seen the last few days, I have no doubt. - No doubt in my medical abilities or my decision making. - Both, actually. Just follow your heart. Everything will work out for the best, okay? Well, here we are again. - Should I go out on a limb and call this our spot? - Hear ye, hear ye. I now christen this our spot. - Come on, Will, no getting sad. - I know, I know. I guess we're both planners in our own way. What is it, Jess? - What do I do, Will? I wanna stop deferring my dreams, find maravu, be spontaneous, be responsible at the same time. My dream is to be here on this island, but everything I built is a continent away. - Hey, no making decisions on vacation. You just gotta worry about being right here right now. - Me and you. Well, one thing is decided. However much time I have left here, I wanna spend it with you. - [Meli] Jessica! Jessica! - [Jessica] What is it, Meli? - [Meli] We got a call at the front desk, someone named Karen. You have to call her right away. - Sorry. (phone rings) Karen. - [Karen] I'm sorry to ask them to chase you down, but you made me promise. - Don't even think about it. What did Dr. Shapiro say? - I believe her words were, "You're in early labor." - What? - Don't worry. My water hasn't broken yet. We still have plenty of time. She thought it would be better if I stayed in the hospital until, you know. - And David? - He's waiting for a connecting flight in Dubai. - Okay. Well, if I leave here soon, I'll get there in time. I just don't want you to worry, okay? - Thanks, for being there. - Well, I won't be if I don't start packing. - But your vacation. - Hey, we made a promise to be there, and we're keeping it. Be strong. We'll be there soon. Thanks. I'm really not good at saying goodbye. - So let's not say it. - (speaks in foreign language) Till we meet again. - There you go. So why am I still sad? I wish... - Me too. - You know where we are and always will be. - I just need one minute. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - You know, the funny thing is I was trying to figure out how Ava and I could stay here a little longer. Well, I guess I jinxed that. There were a lot of surprises this week, Karen's baby being the highest on that list. The one I was least prepared for was this. - Just promise me that wherever life takes you, you do the things that make you happy. - Even if I don't know what those things are yet? - Especially if you don't. - [Ava] Mom, we have to go. - [Nurse] Dr. Martin. - Oh, how's Karen? - She's about to have a baby. - Ah! Ah, Dr. Bailey. - Jessica, if I could have a word. - Yeah, I know what you're asking, and the answer is yes. - Yes? Really? - Yup, absolutely, right in my suitcase. - I think we're talking about two different things. - We're not talking about honey cakes? - Well, it's sweet of you to remember, but I was talking about attending physician. - Oh. - You didn't get my email. - To tell you the truth, I'm a little behind on emails. Can we talk about it after this? - Please, go. And send her my best. - Yeah, will do. - Oh, Karen, he's a dream. - Mom, sit next to Karen. Say baby. - [Jessica And Karen] Baby. - How many are you taking? - I want you to have plenty of good shots to send your husband. - I don't know if that'll be necessary. - [David] Hi, babe. - David. - Here he is, just in time for the first diaper change. (baby cries) - Can we go back in soon? I wanna find out what they named him. - Ava, honey, this is a special time. We need to give them some space. Yeah, and all the rushing to get outta there last night. I'm not sure. Did you get your perfect picture? - Mom, I had a perfect time. That's what's important. But I guess I do have a favorite. - Ah, was it the one on the hike? Oh, wait, wait, the clown fish in the sea anemone? No? - Nope. - This one when you set the timer? - Yeah. - (sighs) Yeah, that is a good one. - Jessica, how's Karen doing? - Beautifully. Yeah, her baby's huge, perfect but huge. We're just giving them some space. - So it would not be a good time to discuss the position? - Yeah, just give me a minute. - Will asked me to give you this when we got back here. - I'll be right back. - [Lani] Yeah, sure. - [Jessica] Excuse me. Has that doctor position been filled yet? - You're back! Oh, my god. - [Jessica] Hi! - [Lani] Good to see you. - [Jessica] Will. - Jessica? What? What are you doing here? Your friend's baby. - Yeah, he's healthy and beautiful, and her husband was with her. - What about the job? - I turned it down. - Why? - Because it wasn't the kind of medicine I wanted to practice. And a wise friend taught me that I should follow my heart. - Is that how it went down? - Yeah, and I heard this resort in Fiji is looking for a doctor. - Did you? - Yeah, but I have some questions. Like what's the benefits package? - What are you looking for? - Horseback riding lessons. - Done. - Occasional long walks on the beach. - Not a problem. - And Ava wants to learn how to surf. - Yes, ma'am. So Ava's on board? - She never wanted to leave. I realized I didn't either. - These islands, they will change you. (dramatic music) - Nice change. (upbeat music)
