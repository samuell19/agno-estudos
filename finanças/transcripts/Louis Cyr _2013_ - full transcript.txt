LOUIS CYR THE STRONGEST MAN ON EARTH St-Jean-de-Matha Quebec, 1910 One moment, please. If you have something for her, give it to me. I must hand it to her personally. I'm afraid not, Mr Barré. It's serious. She refuses to see you. I will not leave until I've spoken to her. Alright, Horace. Give me whatever it is and go. I have things to say, first. No. Things he told me and no one else. You might regret it forever! Did you know your pa came here when he was 16? He didn't come to study, but to get his sisters' things. Your grandfather had had enough of seeing his family in poverty. He decided to try out the US. He took a train with your grandmother and their 10 children to Lowell, a small town where he knew nobody. To fulfil a dream many French-Canadian families had: to stop just surviving and live a little. They soon became disillusioned. Lowell United States, 1878 The Irish were making fun of Pa's bad back. Our big lad grabbed the crate with Labelle and Tanguay. He caught the Irish up in 2 seconds. There were 4 carrot tops to a crate. And only 3 of us! Tanguay was too tired to carry on. He let go, fell over and crushed Labelle. The Irish finished first. But Big Bro got up, grabbed the crate and launched it right over 3 other crates. 1 crate by himself? Full up it was! You lifted a 300-lb crate? Nearer 400, I'd say. All the same, Goodwin's right: show-offs upset folks. - The Irish started it. - Keep out of it! Next time, you'll be out. I doubt it. My pay's been increased. From tomorrow, I'm getting 2 men's wages. I do the work of three men. You eat like ten. No cheek in front of your father. Sorry. Poverty is about the little things: a hole in the wall letting cold air in, a hole in your shoe, dirty water... Little things that add up and end up killing you. Marie. Drink this. We're getting the doctor. OK? Don't worry. We'll find a way. Hey. You practising for my funeral? Pierrot? - What? - Come here for 2 minutes. - What? - Stand there. Get going! Quicker! Nigh on 8 dollars! Thank you. Do him in, Slugger! - On your ass, Ireland! - Hey! Calm down. Carrot top! 514 pounds! Come on. You should fight Mulligan. - I don't know how to box. - Get in the ring and hit him. It looks easy. You should try it. - Hey, Mélina! - Hi, Pierrot. He's the world's strongest man. He just lifted a huge stone at the dump. 514 pounds. - Touch him, he's as hard as a rock. - Hey! Beat it! Don't mind him. He ain't got no manners. He's proud of his brother. It's good. Let's go, eh? Ma will be worried. See you, then. Most of them stopped talking. They looked at me... I didn't even feel the rock on me. I've done nothing in life. No, my lovely. No. I've done nothing. I've seen nothing. I'll die stupid. No, you won't. Marie, my lovely? There's someone to see you. It's Doctor Morgan. Right, well... We'll leave you. Louis, this is Mr Bryce Johnston. He's the son of Mr Johnston, the factory owner. The doctor is a friend of his. Bravo. - Thank you, maybe? - Thanks. Good evening. Hi. Did you... Canadians have to help each other. You always read. It takes you places and it's cheap. Bryce lends me them. He has plenty. He speaks 6 languages. He toured the world. Bryce is some guy. It's generous of him to come. He wasn't hard to convince. He knows illness well. He has less than 1 year to live. Thank you. A fine house you have. Even worse than mine. I nearly died, too. Typhoid fever. Just like her. She don't seem to want to fight. I can understand that. Our district used to be a garbage dump. We live on a mountain of garbage. I understand: she's had enough. I've had enough too. Of waiting. Haven't you? You've looked at me for months. What're you waiting for? Well... I figured you and Johnston... Bryce is a friend. You still hesitate. I ain't gonna jump on you. - Go on! - No, no. It ain't... - It ain't fitting. - "Fitting"? Do as everyone does. You like living packed in like cattle? You ain't bothered remaining ignorant till you die? Forget "fitting". I love you. And you love me, too. I see it in your eyes when you look at me. Let's not waste another 6 months. We've no time to lose... Better now? A little, yes. - I'm very sorry. - 5 foot is too short. I've no other coffins in pine. The epidemic's killed our supply. She's 5 foot 6. I've got 6-footers in oak, but they cost more. We'll take the 5-footer in pine, then. We'll work it out. I can lift 210 lbs. No, he says it's fine. He's giving me 25 bucks a week. - Tell me when and let's go. - Your parents? Nobody's gonna make me stay here. See you later. What'll we do without your pay? We'll send you the money. He's offering me 5 times more money. That means nothing! You don't know the guy. And he's Irish. Every race of people has fools. Your place is here. - With us. - Ah yes... We'll all end up in a pine coffin. I know that nothing's gonna happen for me here. You'll be proud of me. Find your path, my big boy. Follow it. We'll work it out. I'm coming with you! I can't take you. - Let go! - Hey! Listen to me. Ma needs you. After Dad, you're the man. Know what you are? A big, lousy coward! I'll see you again. I hate you. Mac Sohmer had what he called a "2-year plan". New Brunswick as a warm-up. Quebec and Ontario after, for the triumph. I'm not sure about the costume. It'll be fine. No, no, no. No, no. It's a waste of money. - He's not there! - Eh? Didn't even pay for his room. He's robbed us, Louis. 6 months' worth of pay. His room's empty? Low-down son of a bitch. What're we gonna do? My pa told me so. Look at the bright side. It gives us time. Time for what? I dunno... To get married? You'll end up asking me one day. "Mélina Cyr". That sounds good. No money for the train. None for food, even. They knuckled down and did numbers in the street. And? After that, they went on tour. Why're you telling me this? It doesn't change a thing. Give me a chance. You'll see. Montreal took him 6 months. First stop: the Mechanics' Hall. We've done 30 villages in 6 months, we did 100 sell-out shows. Every single show ended with a standing ovation. Everywhere's the same. Don't worry. They'll come. Who's your promoter? My wife and I. We do it ourselves. That works in villages, but Montreal is trickier. To book a hall like this, I need guarantees. Mr Lambert? If he sets foot in here again, throw him out! Boss... Gustave Lambert? I am he. I bet those weights are empty. Are you empty too? Louis Cyr. I don't doubt it. Horace Barré. I know you. I saw your show in Saint-Jean. I'm honoured. Come this way. He told me to see you or he'd ask for a huge advance. I understand, I understand. Filling the Mechanics' Hall isn't like filling a barn. Yes. I understand that. Thanks. Are you in or not? Horace was impressed by what he saw, but... you'll need to do more numbers. I'll organise the programme, staging and publicity. And I'll take 60%. 50-50. After expenses. OK. One more thing... We challenge people who want to challenge me. No problem. 200 bucks to whoever beats Louis Cyr. 200 or 2,000... No risk to you. My partner'll take care of that. Talking of advances, I'll need one. I was conned once before. Once is enough. Where's all this come from? From Bryce. Well, from his family. He died last summer. I brought you some reading, too. 50-50. We can make 250 dollars a show. A year's work in Lowell. I'm proud of you. No, no. Read it and sign it. I'd rather you managed my business. Our business. OK. This'll tide us over. Send half of it to my pa. You and Johnston... nothing happened? Bryce showed me that words and poetry uplift us. That was all it was. Quite something, though. Come, my big bear. Let me show you who my husband is. Good. It's good. It's good, but it looks too easy. It ain't heavy. Only 200 lbs. You're not straining. Doesn't look like much. - Rule no. 1: give a good show. - Rule no. 1: give a real show. It's a show, Louis. We need excitement, theatre. Surprise folks, amaze the audience. Something nobody's ever seen? That's right. Can I borrow that? 178! 186! 2,265 lbs! You too, please. One more. 290! 2,555 lbs! A feat of strength never seen before. If anyone feels he can move this platform weighing over a tonne, step forward now! There's 200 dollars at stake. 200 dollars to whoever beats Louis Cyr in this test! You, sir? You, sir? You, sir? You have nothing to lose, apart from your pride, perhaps. No one? Ladies and gentlemen, Louis Cyr! We said 2,000 lbs or thereabouts. Ladies and gentlemen, 2,555 lbs on one man's shoulders: Louis Cyr! 200 pounds? With one arm? Enough! We get the message! I don't know... He's right. What d'you want in life, Barré? To... to be like you. Unlucky. I wanna be the world's strongest man. There can be only one. I don't want to give up my place. How do you do it? That dumbbell saves me from poverty and insignificance. If I don't lift it, I'm nothing. Don't try to be like me. Aim higher. Lift it, you lazy bugger. Yes. Up to your shoulder! The hard bit's done. Push it up! I can't do it! Think of a girl you like! You want to impress her. - There isn't one. - Think of your ma, damn idler! Push! Push! Think of someone you hate! The doctor! Dr Sargent. He thinks you're "nothing"! Are you nothing? Are you really nothing? Push! Push! OK, OK! It's good! Barré's big and strong and he don't know it. What's that? That's 2 years of marriage. You forgot, like last year. I'll make it up. Oh! She's kicking. "She"? You're too pretty to have boys. Charmer. Open it. The Merrimack bridge? Turn over. Read it. It took me days. - No. You read it. - It's too embarrassing. Well? I don't know what to say. Thank you. OK? Yeah. My ulcer's really flared up, son of a bitch. Got what I wanted? - Yes. - Good. When you write "b", that's it, with "o"... That's right. It makes "bo". So, if I add "t" after "bo", it makes "bot", like boat. No. "O" in boat is written "o,a". - "O,a"? - Yes. Why? I don't know. It's the same. Like goat that you eat, that's "o,a". So bow, as in bow and arrow, is "boa". No. Bow is "b,o,w". "B,o,a" is "boa", as in boa constrictor. - Are you kidding me? - No. OK. Next. He didn't get it: he was the opposite of you. Heard of David "Baby" Michaud? A Citadelle of Quebec soldier. The first to challenge your pa. I still remember. He said that Louis wasn't strong, that he amused people. His promoter staked 500 dollars. He used it to make a belt: the belt for Canada's strongest man. Next week? Forget it! - I'll crush him with my pinkie. - Normally, maybe. But in your condition... We cancelled 3 weeks of shows! How'll you sell our show if someone else wears the belt? - They invented it. - Who cares. I want it! Why d'you think he wants to face you now? His promoter came and saw you were sick. No. In a month, if you're better. Mélina's having the baby then. Louis, if you lose, Michaud won't grant you a rematch. It might affect your career. Do yourself a favour. Take a few days to think. Please. - Ready for your lesson? - Yes. Erm... I got this. It's from my pa. It's a telegram. Yeah. I figured that. Thanks, Horace. Right. What? It's... It's your mother. She's dead. Her funeral is... Actually, it was last week. If I can do anything at all... You can't, but I can. Cyr vs Michaud Quebec 1887 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a memorable meeting between two veritable forces of nature! At stake: the belt for Canada's strongest man! What's going on? We're ready. This is stupid. - How're you gonna do it? - Quickly. Without further ado, here's your star from Quebec, David "Baby" Michaud! And from Montreal, Louis Cyr. Shake hands. First feat of strength: the one-arm press. "Baby" Michaud will start with 158 lbs. Yeah! Come on! 158 lbs lifted! 218 lbs lifted. Four! Five! I'm not well. "Baby" Michaud is unwell. The rules state that illness annuls the contest. Bunch of cheats! Calm down, please! Calm down! Is he withdrawing? Michaud withdraws from the contest! That's enough! That's enough. Congratulations. You're the Canadian champion. Your belt. Your 500 bucks. Bravo. Good night. Glory's a fine thing, eh? I'm going home. Wait a moment. Be proud of what you've done. I just wanted to say, "Well done". - Thanks, Gus. - Yes, congratulations. Quite an achievement: a large 7-lb baby. Are you kidding me? It looks like something's come up at home. She was in a hurry. She decided to come out early. Look, Lili. It's your daddy. The strongest man in Canada. "Lili"? We said Emiliana, but that's too long for this little scrap. What are you waiting for? I'm not. I'm coming. She couldn't possibly be too heavy for you. She has her father's hands. He never spoke of his ulcer after that, except to say that the baby had cured it. You. Needless to say, he could've thanked me. - Don't say that. - You're not caged up like me. - You have something for me? - Hear the rest. His victory changed his life. He toured Canada, the USA. He shattered records. The press, charities, politicians all wanted him. Sorry, gents, Emiliana doesn't give interviews yet. You'll be OK? It's a big day. - Not too nervous? - No. This way, this way. Is he here? Louis... My Louis. If your ma could see you now. Hey, big man. Pierrot? Pierre. No, Pierrot! Your granddaughter, Emiliana. Lili. Hello, Lili. Sorry to disturb you, but we must go. The Prime Minister wants to shake his hand. Yes. We can't keep the Prime Minister waiting. We pay tribute to a man who is a credit to our province and our race. The whole of Canada can be proud to count this man as one of its citizens. Prime Minister, esteemed colleagues and dignitaries, let us now welcome Mr Louis Cyr! Bravo! To highlight your numerous exploits and your contribution to promoting the French-Canadian nation, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society is proud to present to you this honorary belt. Louis Cyr, thank you, bravo, best wishes for the future. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bravo! Thank you. Please let us through. Thank you. - Are you proud of your achievement? - Absolutely. Thank you. - Nice belt, Mr Cyr. - Thank you, sir. Worth spit on the world stage. Nobody is stronger than Louis Cyr. Not sure Eugene Sandow would agree. The US tour we're about to do will prove Louis is the strongest. Tours are circus acts. They prove nothing. - I'll give you a circus! - Pierrot. You're right. This belt's worth nothing. But I'll give it worth. - Who's he? - Promoter. Who's Eugene Sandow? Don't you read the paper? He's the talk of Europe. Says he's the world's strongest man. We have other fish to fry. Shall we go? Enough! No! Continue! Louis! Lili! No! Louis! You OK? Yes. Daddy! Are you OK? Yes, Lili. Daddy's fine. It's just that Daddy asked his saddler, Joe, to check the seams were strong enough. And Joe told him: "As strong as you are, Louis." Would you be kind enough to sign this? - For my son in hospital. - With pleasure. And write a note. Nothing much. - He'd love it. - I ain't in the mood. He admires you so much. - Something simple. - Listen, no! You write it. Er... What's his name? - Jean. - "Jean." Why don't you stop wasting your time? I'm just a lowly factory worker. That suits me fine. But you... You have a gift. It can take you to the top. Circus numbers are OK. But, I'm talking about the world title. That means contacting this guy. You can prove we're the best. You owe it to us. To me, Pa and all French-Canadians. I'm warning you, move it or I'll kick you to the moon and back. - Sad to be going back? - No! We're keen to get back to our hole! Pa, I spoke to Lamothe there. He's selling his farm. Nice big piece of land. It's yours, if you want it. Sure he wants it. Eh, Pa? You serious? - I can't accept. - You can. - He's overcome. - Just... We'll think it over. Travel safely. Hope to see you soon. You big rascal. - See ya, Pierrot. - Bye. See you soon. Why didn't you tell me? It was a surprise. I don't mean that. Louis, I love you, whether you can read or not. Eh? What're you on about? I've had my doubts for a while. You think all of that? Soon, you'll be reading it yourself. I'll show you. Horace has been trying for years. It just won't go in. Horace is Horace. And I am me. What about our tour? The USA? The Maritimes? Ontario? - We'll lose money. - I don't care. You've changed your tune. Hey... He's made you rich. He owes you nothing. Can you book a hall in London? D'you know anyone there? Ever been to Europe? We can do all that here. Sandow will never come here. Louis is a future world champion. His path is decided. Understand? Of course I understand. It doesn't mean that I accept it. New York USA - Louis! - What? Embarrassed? We ain't here to talk about literature. "I am lovely, O mortals, "Like a dream of stone, "And my bosom, Where each man is bruised in turn, "To inspire the love of a poet Is prone, "Like matter "Eternally silent and stern." Les Fleurs du Mal. You speak French? Spanish, German, Italian... Per lei, belladonna. My gift to you. Thank you. - Hello, hello. - Hello. Good journey? - A long one. - I can imagine. I've a surprise for you. Can't say any more. We're tired, Horace. It's worth it. Come on. One second. - Are you ready? - Yep. Are you mad! Her spine! Let go! - I'm strong, eh? - Daddy's girl alright! She lifted 150 lbs too. I'll be the strongest in the world. Oh yeah? Another copycat. No. I said "the strongest". Stronger than Dad. That's the spirit, Lili. I'm proud of you, my angel. - I can't go? - I told you. Our girl... My parent's will look after her. She needs her mother. I've been dreaming about going! - Please let me go! - We can't take you. Mr Fox promised us concert tickets. You can't come. That's how it is. Give me one good reason! I'm your husband. I decide. Good enough for you? The big one's you. The other one's me. Your dumbbell's bigger than mine. - This is my back lift. - It's good. - What am I doing? - You're clapping. I can't draw that. Yes, it is hard. I got to here with Mummy. Daddy's got a better idea. He's gonna tell you another story. Then you'll know 2 stories. Right. Do you know the story... of the Three Little Pigs? That's that story. Well, Daddy will find another story. Did I ever tell you the story of Louis Cyr versus "Baby" Michaud? - Again? - Ah yes, "again". We were at La Citadelle. There were lots of soldiers there. Another lesson before I'm sick? We'll be teaching the lessons. I can't wait to get there! London England 2 months later, nobody had come forward. He was like a caged lion. Fox restricted his lifts: he'd lift just enough to amaze people without scaring competitors. Back lift, 4,000 lbs. They didn't pay to see half a show. Sampson the Great lifts elephants. But he uses a pulley. This fool challenges you to 500 lbs. His turn comes and he secretly empties the dumbbell. Public goes wild. This guy... Cyclops: snaps chains around his arms. They're pre-sawed. None of them can beat you. Yes. But our boat leaves in 2 weeks. Listen here, Mr Fox, we trusted you, we came all the way here, I cut my hair, got dressed up. I showed restraint. I did my bit. Now, you do yours. Yeah, sure... Think he got the message? How can I ever thank you? I hope you'll put him in his place. What's that? The news went around all the newspapers. Louis Cyr was to face his most formidable opponent: himself. World record Crucifix 97 lbs left arm 88 lbs right arm World record, one-arm snatch 188.5 pounds World record, one-arm press 273 pounds World record, back lift 4,337 pounds World record, 2-handed lift 1,897 pounds He couldn't read, but he rewrote the strength record books in 2 hours. How does it feel, alone at the top? Sandow said it was I who didn't want to face him. It's quiet. No one's talking. Can I go? She's right. Are you gonna be mad at me forever? My circus idea with Horace... We're gonna go for it. Big business. I'd like Lili to be involved. Let's do it as a family. We need a change of scene. All of us together. I don't wanna be apart again. I'm sorry. 5 years later He hasn't seen Sandow's film? No. Hey! Seen the new film? It's been replaced. Have you seen the paper? - He's coming to New York. - And? - We'll be in Pelham. - Yes. It's not far away. We'll write to Fox. Again? You should burn this. You'll go crazy. Don't start. I've got a bad back. Fox's 5,000-dollar challenge didn't rouse him. What can we do? I'll offer another 5,000. Yes. - Your turn, Daddy. - I'm here, Lili. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Write down: 8 ropes in cart no. 3. - Son of a bitch! - Eh? - What's up? - What d'you want? - Go away! - Get over here! Go away! Beat it! Stay here, Lili. Beat it! - Louis! - Back off! Back off! Louis! Are you crazy? That's enough! What is the problem? Back to work. Please tell me what's going on! It's Fox. Fox invited Sandow to New York. Add: "The strongest man on earth". Lili? Forget the act. What? No more circus. You're going to boarding school. Eh? Never! No hurry. Finish the tour. No. That's it. - What have I done? - Hey! Sweetheart, go finish the list. I'll speak to Dad and join you. Study... You can't disagree: you find it so impressive. Take it out on me, not on our daughter. She'll not end up a circus animal! Not my daughter. High society won't stab her in the back. School for her. Horace, tell the press to be at Portland: they'll see something they've never seen. She's gone back home. With Lili. I confess that... I understand her not wanting to see. The journalists? They're here. Everybody is here. It's not too late to harness up just two. Our 2 biggest ones. That's 3,100 lbs. Do what I said. More battered than you thought? You're fine. You should see the horses. Fox heard about it. He said that no other man on earth could have held them. Even Sandow didn't contradict him. The Ringlings offered Lili a job. They predict... Their letter. Give me it. It matters to her. You don't know how much. Horace, I give you my title. It's up to you to defend it. It's not a good idea. I just want you to accept it like a man. It's an honour. You'll go to school. End of story. It'll never fit through the door. Do whatever. I don't care. Get it in the lounge by 12pm. 10 years later, he was still alive. The family party during school term was his idea. He was trying to make the peace. Happy birthday, my love. - Good journey? - Yes. You've got even prettier. Come. I have something for you. I got it from France. It's a Pleyel. Apparently, it's the best make. Happy birthday, Lili. Don't you want to try it? If you want to hear your piano, take lessons. Thank you for the dinner, but I can't. Lili... You should thank me. "Thank you"? For stopping me doing what I wanted to do in life? - He wanted to protect you. - From what? - Success? - But look... look at yourself. You're brilliant. Cultivated. You're top of your class in music, literature, everything! You're my pride. "Your pride", yeah... What about mine? Even when I draw you a picture... you don't understand. Décarie! Décarie! Décarie! I've learned that Horace Barré has retired. So, his title reverts to... Louis Cyr. - Sir... - 1 question. Are you ready to challenge the old lion? I'm as scared of him as I am of a lamb. He holds all the world records. A past world champion hiding behind illness... is not scary. Is this just a publicity stunt? Would you bet on it? As a sign of his good faith, I'll drop 2,000 dollars off at La Patrie newspaper office tomorrow. Louis? - I'm here. - Louis? Louis? You tried to lift that? Help me. My back's gone. Is it because of the papers? Décarie and Lambert? An idler and a traitor. Don't die for them! Lili's ungrateful, heartless. No. They're not to blame. I am. We're responsible for what happens to us. At least Lili is top of her class. I can't be stupid with a daughter like that. You're far from stupid. I didn't want her ending up like me. You're respected, a hero, rich... What more d'you want? You. Your husband, who lifts weights, but can't read... do you respect him? Does he make you dream? I love you. That's all that should matter. Didn't we say 7pm? I'm early. A drink? I'm in a hurry, if you don't mind. You can't really say you've used it much. I'm amazed he accepted. Champions... don't back down. I'd like to believe it. Have you seen him recently? He can barely walk. He'll never work again. He's done nothing for 2 years. Someone has to defend the title. I don't have a choice. You're right. We can't let him do it. It's your title. You appear tonight, instead of Louis Cyr. - They don't want to see me. - I'll bear the consequences. No, no. I can't. Nice house. You did well out of the circus. Be a man. See you later. Disgrace for Cyr, he hands his title to Décarie amid boos I should've gone to see him, got down on my knees, said sorry. I was too ashamed. I forced the greatest athlete ever into mediocrity. I made him humiliate himself in public. Mind you, I wonder... if he accepted the challenge because of you. To show you where a strongman career leads to. He can't walk. He doesn't eat. I know, Mummy sends me news. He gave me a letter for you. Louis Cyr taught me all I know. He made me rich. He handed me a champion's title on a silver platter. I have the strength. But I haven't the heart. I betrayed him. If I could help him get his daughter back... that would be something. You want me to jump into his arms? It's not that simple. Little Miss Cyr... The strongest girl on earth. It's time to prove it. I am sorry, I love you. Your father. In 1912, Louis Cyr died of chronic nephritis. He was 49. His records have never been broken.
