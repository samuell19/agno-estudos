What's that? Oh, it's, uh, it's nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. Uh, I'm just playing with some images I downloaded. Uh-huh. So you can get all up inside my body but I can't get inside your head? Is that it? No, it's just, I'm not trying to hide anything from you. It's just... The whole thing changes when I try to put it into words. The inspiration just becomes lifeless the moment I struggle to define it. - Anyway, it's a stupid idea. - No, hey, listen... - It is. - No, seriously, like... I didn't mean to pry. I'm sorry, okay? You have your process. And I totally get that. And I respect it. A coyote. If he's alone, he'll eat the rat. But if he's got some help and he's in his pack, he'll eat the deer. Now, if he's really desperate, he'll even eat the carrion. It's pretty cool, right? I mean, he doesn't give a shit. He just needs to feed. It's fucking cool. Mr. Gleason, can I talk to you about my grade? Yeah. How can I help you, Mr. Young? Well, I don't understand why you gave me a C minus. Well, I... I think you may be in over your head. You see, every one of your classmates has been studying photography with me since freshman year. Fuck that prick. What he thinks he likes will change the moment someone innovative transforms the conversation. Shit. I mean, Maybe he's right. Look at me, listen. It doesn't matter, hey. It doesn't matter if he hates you. It doesn't matter if he loves you. All that matters is what inspires you. You'll be okay. Yeah, thank you. Come on, let's get out of here. Every moment of my life is filtered through an ever changing collage of memories. Happy memories and tragic ones. My memories are at the core of everything I think, everything I feel. Even the love and fear I feed can point to memories as their common ancestor. Snapshots, life fragments forever reinterpreted and relived. The most intimate relationships I have are with my memories. Some I love, some I loathe. But there is no memory that I seem capable of living without. You okay? My career is dead. I'm fucking dead. Yeah. Your adoring public awaits. Oh, right. I, uh, saw Winston Guest arrive. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm, come on. He said I devolved a once promising art-form. It's not his job to sell your work, it's mine. Good, because if that was the case, he'd be doing a shit job. It's just one opinion, one man. Yeah, but it's the only one that people actually read. No, that's not actually true. Besides, what he says does not diminish your powerful work in any way. It doesn't, not in my eyes, not in anyone with a desire to search beyond conventional prosaic bullshit. Truth? Truth. I don't know why I do it. And I don't know who I do it for. - Yeah. - Hey, you're a genius. Trust in here. Everything will work out. Okay. - Come on. - You know, I never knew there were so many different forms of the word amateur. You know, I think he used it as a noun, and adjective and even an adverb. Take a breath. Mr. Guest, hello. Thank you so much for coming. Ah, Miss Stewart. I'm sure you remember Mr. Maxfield Young. Mr. Guest, it's good to see you again, sir. Ah, yes, young Mr. Young. I'm certain that we all doubt the sincerity of that statement, huh? You know, I appreciate your constructive criticism. I think it's helped me grow as an artist. Well, I had hoped so. Well, I was very sincerely moved by your early work, and consequently the potential of your entire career, but these subsequent forays are just one-dimensional, altogether impersonal. I respectfully disagree, Mr. Guest. Well. I am extremely confident when I say that at this moment in time, you are Mr. Young's greatest asset. I'll thank you for the champagne and say goodnight. - I'll walk you out. - Oh. Shit. Hey, you know I'd offer you something to drink but all I've got is tap water. I wouldn't wash my dirty socks in unfiltered tap water. Yeah, I know, right? Do you want to go to my place? I've got wine... and water. Yeah, I don't know what the big deal is with my place. Well, if you can get past the chain-smoking cat lady. Yeah, right. Shit. Look, it's not that big of a deal, okay? Besides, Whole Foods, mm? - Alright. - It's right down there. - There's that. - Mm-hmm. Oh, you know what? Oh, shit, I think I actually left it downstairs. Back in a second. Are you working on a new concept? Uh... nothing, nothing. Everyone's scared to look truth in the face. Look truth in the face. Fuck. Fuck you! Fucking all wasted! Fuck! So you're just going to act like nothing's up? I'm only gone a few days. Max, come on. You sure you don't want me to come with? Keep you company? Road trip could be good for us. Yeah. No, I know, um, I just... I think I need to be alone right now. Okay? You know, I'm hoping the solitude will clear my head. And maybe reboot some creativity? I don't just want a lover, Max. I can get a lover anywhere. I want a best friend. Yeah. I don't know that I've ever been in love. Someone once told me that when you feel romantic love... you're really just infatuated with the way the other person sees you. The reflection they cast is forgiving, without judgment. Eventually, you train them to see you the way you see yourself. And the illusion of love vanishes. Another one of my dad's pearls of wisdom. Max Young. That's a good name. So how come I don't know you, Max Young? You're in my Biology class. Yeah. English Lit too. So are you like super creative or super creepy? Well, look, I just wanted to pay you back for the two subs you gave those Felch twins. Who's at the door? Let's see that. Who's at the door? Max Young. Yeah. Wow. Almost didn't recognize you, Max. Hey. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time, right? No. No, man, seems like ages since we've seen you. - Yeah. - When was the last time? Jimmy, why don't you take him upstairs? I'll be right up, okay? All right, yeah. - It was good seeing you, Max. - Yeah, Jimmy. Hey, I'm sorry for not staying in touch, you know? Hey, it's hard to keep tabs on the little people while you're blowing up, right? Jimmy, the baby. Okay, I'll be right up. - Yeah. - Thanks. Bye. Take care, Max. What, What are you doing showing up here unannounced after all this time? Yeah, I, uh, you know, I just thought that... You thought? You thought that we were friends, that we'd welcome you with open arms and make up the guest room for you? Oh, I... You know, I didn't know how you'd feel. Yeah, you're goddamn right you don't know how I feel right now. Raine was my best friend. My entire world. I loved her. Yeah. You know, you know I loved her too. Shut the fuck up, okay? Don't come to my house and say that to me, please. You were together, what, six, eight months? I knew everything about her, she knew everything about me. You were the fucking mystery man and you are still playing that card. Get the fuck... Un-fucking-believable. Dude, you got here so fast. That's impressive shit. - Keep it. - Thanks. No, thank you. Where've you been? I got to tell you... you got the nicest ass that I have ever seen. Don't fucking touch me. Come on, I got some blow. It'll take a lot more than that, Chuckie. It'll be fun, baby. A little blow for blow. Do you think you can just talk to me however the fuck you want 'cause I jerked you off once in ninth grade? I mean, if you could even really call it that as I remember you were spewed and spent before I even touched your fucking belt buckle. It's really embarrassing, Chuckie, you should probably get that checked out. You fucking cunt! Shit. Are you okay? I think my bike cable broke and I lost control. My bad. Whoah, whoah, dudes, dudes, wait, wait. Uh, uh, could I interest you in a couple of ham and cheese footlongs as my apology? Yeah? Cool, all right. Who the fuck was that? Fuck if I know, man. - Hey. - Oh, jeez. Whoa. Pretty dangerous with that thing. So why'd you run off? I didn't run off, I just, - I had to get back to work. - Hmm. Don't I know you? I mean, I've seen you around. Aren't you in my Biology class? Yeah, English Lit too. Huh. So are you like super creative or super creepy? What's your name? Max. - Max Young. - Max Young. That's a good name. So how come I don't know you, Max Young? I just moved here in the beginning of senior year. Hmm. Well, look, I just, um, I just wanted to pay you back for the two subs you gave those Felch twins. No, it's cool. It was the end of the night and they were takeouts nobody picked up, so. I thought you just said you had to get back to work. Are we done? Yeah. We're done. I'm sorry. I'm weird. - You think? - Yeah, it's just I'm not real social, you know? I don't relate to things that most people think about and vice versa. You think you know me but you don't. Whoa, wait, Raine. You know my name? I never introduced myself. Right, I, um. I think I heard somebody call you. Ah. Right. Do you want to hang out? I feel as though I've been turned inside out. Everything exposed, unprotected, vulnerable to a world that brushes by with its filthy hands. I try to wash and disinfect but I can't. Find everything all right? Yeah, thanks. Max Young? Hey, Calvin. How are you, man? What are you doing here? Well, I, uh... I came to pay my respects. It's 8.50. Yeah. Thanks. She's got like the perfect body. Oh, shit. I'd let her fuck me to death. I don't just want a lover, Max. I want a best friend. You're the coolest fucking person I've ever met. You live here? I live right across the way. Yeah, I know. What do you mean you know? I've seen you walk by. So. Uh, do you want to come in? Wait, I thought the Walters lived here. They do. We're house sitting. My mom and Mrs. Walters were roommates in college. Cool. I wonder how long it took them to collect all these books. Ah. The books are the only possessions in the room that are mine. Clothes? Yeah. Well, some of them. Whoah. These Yale Shakespeare Editions must be like 200 years old. More like 100. So how did you possibly amass all of these volumes? Uh, Some of them I got from my mom but most of them I bought from like Amazon and eBay. You got all these books online? Yeah. You know, you'd be surprised. I mean, most people treat their old books like garbage. But, no. I feel a kinship with my books. I think it's a critical component in a person's life. The books you've read and the one's you haven't. Mm. So how many of these books have you read? I mean, I read them when I first get them. So all of them? Well, some of them I'd already read so I usually don't read them again. Yeah, you, uh, wouldn't want to appear obsessive. So are you a Maxwell or a Maximilian? Maxfield. Maxfield? Is that a family name? Have you read this? Oh, man, had it read to me is more like it. God, I haven't seen that in forever. I miss being a kid. When the fantasy worlds were real. Yeah, same. It's the first edition, 1897. - Holy shit. - Yeah. You know this was the first book that Maxfield Parish illustrated? He also did the original cover for Arabian Nights. He used photographs as the basis for his work. And then he would alternate between oils and glaze to get a 3D effect. Amazing artist, right? He's like way ahead of his time. So you were named after Maxfield Parish? I was inspired by his work when I was a kid. Maxfield Young? - You're a junior? - Hm. Technically, once the senior is deceased the junior suffix is removed. Huh. I thought you just said you were named after Maxfield Parish. No, I said I was inspired by him when I was a kid. Mm-hmm. Okay, I see how you work. How'd your dad die? Heroin overdose. So is, like, your mom going to come busting in up on us? She's gone. She's pretty good about respecting my privacy. That's refreshing. My parents pretend to be all evolved and shit, while secretly monitoring my every move like the fucking NSA. Which is why my mom thinks I'm having a little sleepover tonight at my brother's. - Good morning. - Hey. How did you sleep? Mmm. As good as ever. Hey, do you want to go with me to a party? I'm not really a party kind of guy. - Are you saying you're inflexible and don't change? - No, I'm not. You only possess certain characteristics and you're only going to possess those - and only those characteristics? - No, I'm not. 'Cause I got to say, like, if that's the case, that's a fucking deal-breaker for me, man. I can't be with some guy who has some bullshit preconceived notion of himself. We're not set in stone. We're 60 percent water, we're human beings. We're designed to be fluid! It's a Saturday night for fuck's sake! Whoah, whoah, okay. I mean, I, think, I... I think I could go to a party. You think you could go? Okay, well, want to know what I think? I think that you - gave in so quick. - Oh. - You are such a little pussy. - That's a good one. You know that? Like 2.5 seconds. It's a world record. - Is it really? - Yeah. It's pretty humiliating, - I'm embarrassed. - Is it? Okay. - No, don't tickle. - I'm embarrassed for you. - I'll get you back. - Oh, will you? I'm a tickle master. Come here, come here. Okay, why don't you put your money where your mouth is! Come here! Even when I sleep, my mind refuses to quiet. Constant rambling thoughts with no apparent origin, no destination. When I was a little kid, sleep was my best friend. We're not so close anymore. Hey. Did I not make myself clear last night? I don't have anything to say to you. Yeah, you did, um. Can we talk, Lucy, please? It will just take a minute. What is it that can't wait till after we brush our teeth? I know it's been a while since I've been back. You know, I lost touch and, um... you know, things changed. Things changed, yeah. Is that what you came by to tell me at the fucking break of dawn, that things changed? Were you and Raine close right up until she died? Why the fuck would you ask me that? Nah, it's just... I was hoping that, uh... like, you could help me fill in some blanks. Yeah? Let me fill in this blank for you. If I see you back here, I'm going to call the cops, okay? So go away, Max. Okay, let's go buddy. - Come dance with me. - Hmm. Mmm-mm. - Come on. - No, no, no, no. - Today is the day. - I can't. You don't really have a choice, so. - I've got no rhythm. - You have rhythm, honey. It's just dormant. Come on, come play with me. - Dormant? - Yeah, you know, undeveloped. Breathe, stop thinking for like one second, okay? Just move. Move the way that you feel when you watch me. - Okay. - Okay? You feel too much. I love that you don't have any tattoos or piercings. Really? Yeah. You know all my friends think it's this... unique form of self-expression. Indigenous people have been doing it for thousands of years, blah, blah, blah. Okay, first of all, you don't live in a fucking indigenous culture so what the fuck does that have to do with anything? And unique? Please. I don't know one person, one person in our senior class. Who hasn't altered their flesh in some way, you know? I mean, even my grandmother has a Tweety Bird tattooed on her ass. Really? It's like if you want to be unique... try being yourself. You know, I never thought about getting a tattoo. I know. Max? I'll do it with you. Are you serious? Max? I need you to promise me. Max. Do you promise? Promise me, Max. Jesus. You okay? I promise. Okay? Okay. I just don't get small talk. What do you mean you don't get it? It's small talk, what's not to get? Everything is small. The amount of words, the level of investment, the world from which you pull your subject matter, small. Yeah, I know what it means. I'm just incapable of it, okay? I can't start it and I can't finish it. Or you are a brilliant conversationalist brimming with insights. Come on. Okay now, you're the coolest fucking person I've ever met. Now mingle. I love you, Max. Thank you. - What's up, Chuck? - Hey, man. - Thanks. - Don't thank me, Thank my mama's back surgery. Hey, Chuck. Look who showed up. What's that fucking faggot doing here? You know what? I'm going to fuck him up, then I'm going to fuck that bitch. Raine! Ooh, Hi! It's so good to see you. You look hot. Thank you very much. Is that for me? Yes, drink this. Mmm. God, you look gorgeous. Thank you. This is Max. These are my friends, Jan, and Jane and I think you know Lucy. - Oh. Oh-ho! - Yes, yes. - No! - Come on. Just a second, come on. This is... What, who is playing this? This has got... we have to change this right now, - Now? - Yes. - Come on, now. - I'll be right back. - Raine, come on! - Coming, I'm coming. So are you going to, like, like suck my soul? Just then we downed monstrous curls behind this tar barrel. You remember that? Okay, so out of all the things - that they could have chosen... - Yeah, well... Tweedledee and Tweedle-fucking-dum? That's really sad, is what it is. - It is a tragedy. - It kind of upsets me, like I want to cry a little bit in my soul. - Well, you have to tell them. - Me? - You know that, right? - Oh, right, I'm going to tell them. - You have to. - No fucking way. It's your responsibility. Like, really? No, no way! Nobody, nobody ever wants to hear the truth. - No. - No, not about themselves. - Not about that. - Not about the world. Nope. So like, what do you get inside the truth? Like, okay, tragedy. - Mm-hmm. - Heartbreak. - And it's fucking random. - Mmm. So the only way to live with it all is to simply not give a fuck. I was Batman for Halloween three years ago. Basically, I guess what I'm trying to say is the... entire fucking world is scared to death! Swinging in the dark! You know, and all I see are cowards. Coward, coward, coward, coward, it's fucking cowards everywhere. Hm. You're remarkably cheery tonight. - And why? - Come on. How long are you planning on dating Mr. Subdued? - That's clever. - Did you like that? - Yeah, I see what you did there. - Yeah, I thought the bookworm in you would appreciate that little double entendre. Yeah, well, it's really more of a pun. - Oh, is it? - Yeah. Oh, well, who fucking really cares, really right? I mean... The point is, what are you, what are you doing with this guy, Raine? Are you serious? You haven't said two words to him. Give him a chance, he'll grow on you, I promise. I don't see it. I just don't see it, I'm sorry. Okay, well, you don't have to see it. You just have to try. Just pretend for one night, for me, okay? Oh, okay. I guarantee he'll think I am, like, crazy about him tonight, so. - Why is that? - Why? Oh, I don't know. Um, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, 'cause we'll be rollin'! Come on, do drugs with me. Please, do drugs with me. Come on, it's been forever! I told you I don't do that stuff anymore. - Oh, oh, please. - Oh, okay. What, like, Mr. Straight Lace doesn't approve of the Raine that we all know and love, - like the actual Raine? - Very funny. Yeah, his name is Max, I told you that. Uh, okay. Yeah, that's cool. Go play house with Max, that's cool. Go make a soup. Seriously? I... seriously? Hey. What was that? Yeah, no, that's it. Just die before you even live. - Hey. - Right? That's the motto - of the great masses! - Shh, shh, - You're getting out of... - Right?! - No, you're done. - Am I right? You're getting out of control. Just read about it in a book. - Okay, she can do that. - Great. Yeah, stop, all right? Yeah, stop. Just calm, breathe. So, how'd you hook up with Raine Bennett? I have no idea. Dude, I've been dreaming about that hot ass since, like, seventh grade. She's got the perfect body, man. I'd... Oh, I'd hit that so hard. I mean, I'd let her fuck me to death. Hey. You ready to go? Yes. See you, Calvin. - Oh, my god, who says that? - I know. You seem like you were having a really nice time. You know what? I think you were right. I do have a surprising number of small thoughts in my head. So it's the cocky little cunt and her delivery bitch. I love this book. You know, I think it's got to be my favorite novel of all time. Dude, you read like 10 books a week. How can you remember all the books you've read? I have no idea. What's so great about it? Everything. Okay, Mr. Specific, maybe just, like, Well, he likes to get into taboo shit. You know, sex with children, dead bodies. Ew, that sounds horrible. No, I'm not explaining it very well. You just, you have to read it. Yeah, well, after that little Cliff note, I don't think that's very likely. It's more about human nature and perception. The thin line between reality and illusion. And you're not really sure what's real. The narrator and the author are both heroin addicts. I really want to meet your mom. Yeah. Yeah, most definitely. And what about us? It's all I think about. The truth is elusive, evasive, polymorphic, a matter of perspective. Context, leave out a single word, a specific detail, change the emphasis, the truth mutates, it adapts. The truth is the ultimate survivor. And it's a ghost. It can manipulate your heart, distort your mind. My truth, your truth, God's truth. No precaution is taken. All the people in this room are heroin users. Heroin is the strongest, most devastating opiate that exists. Its possession is absolutely prohibited in the United States. A hype will bring this narcotic to a... Jesus. You scared the shit out of me. Nobody answered when I rang the bell. What you watching, Maxie? I guess that's a stupid question. I've sort of become obsessed with learning about heroin use and the whole underground culture that surrounds it. I think I'm going to try it, just once, so I know what it's like. You know, I think I need to know what it's like. Wait a minute, are you serious? - Yeah. - That's fucking insane. What? What more do you need to know? I mean, it fucks up your world, it changes who you are on a core level. I can do it just the one time. - Whoah. - Okay? - Okay. - No, I mean, look. It's not that big of a deal, okay? I mean, I know... Besides, I think it would help me kill off some demons. More like give birth to some new ones. Raine, I'm disciplined, okay? You know that, okay? - Max. - I can do this. Discipline has absolutely nothing to do with it, okay? This is heroin. What would your mom think? Oh... come on. What happened to not caring what people think? Max, baby, your mind is all twisted on this, okay? If you think that I'm going to stand back and watch you trash your life, or like condone it or whatever, you're fucking nuts! Hey, trash... come on. Look, hear me out, okay? What if when we die, we discover, hey, we discover that the goal in life was to simply have as many different experiences as possible? I mean, maybe my dad was right. Think about it. Human beings instinctively seek out alternate realities. It's in our DNA. There's no judgment. No one's defined reality. It's all an illusion, Raine. Max. I'm not playing this fucking game, okay? Intravenous drug use is a fucking deal breaker for me. - Is that right? - Yeah. Well, you know, I think I read somewhere that ultimatums are bad for relationships. I'm serious, Max, you shoot heroin, we're done. So, what? Are you just going to use our relationship as a bargaining chip, is that it? No, I'm not. I'm using the truth. Shit. I got to get to work. Throw your bike in the jeep, I'll drive you. Disease of one type may be directly transmitted into the bloodstream of another. Hey, Raine. Can you pass me my cell? Thank you. Don't be giving away any free subs. Right. Oh, shit. Yeah? Hi. I'm Raine. I finally get to meet you, Raine! I'm Carol. - Wow. - Hi, nice to meet you. You know, I don't think Max is home though. He's already off at work. Yeah, I know, um, I actually just left my backpack upstairs. Oh. You want to come get it? Yeah, if that's okay. - Cool, come on in. - Thanks. It's nice to get you alone, you know? I've been wondering how he's doing 'cause I feel like I've been missing in action. Oh, um, he's good, you know. - You think? - We're just hanging out, yeah. - Yeah. - I worry about him, I just worry about him 'cause new situations are hard and his new school... Is he making any friends? Uh, some, you know. He just is a recluse. He kind of stays in his room. - Yeah, definitely. - He doesn't reach out. - Keeps to himself. - And I try and leave him room with that because of all he's been through with his mom. And I can't imagine finding my mother so soon after losing my dad. It makes me so angry, these pharmaceutical drugs. But you know, he's an amazing young man. He's just through it all, so strong. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know if he told you about us, but I wanted him to come live with me. His mom was my roommate and I loved her so much. We were college roommates and I told her if anything ever happened, you know, I would be there. But now I'm glad you're there, really. So good to meet you. - I'm just going to... - Oh, yeah, sorry. - Thank you. - Yeah. Max. I'll do it with you. Tonight. Are you serious? Just this one time, okay? Once. And then we never do it again. Yeah. Max... I need you to promise me. Promise me, Max. Yeah. Hey, come here. I promise. Okay, promise. Okay. Jesus. Not that big of a deal. Will you do that? Please. Yeah. It's fucking cool. Just this one time, okay? And then we never do it again. Hey. Are you sure this is cool? Yeah, Lucy's parents are still in San Diego. Right, but, I mean, do you think Lucy will be cool with this? I think out of all people Lucy would be cool with it. Right. Whoah, what?! - Lucy. - Shit, hello? - Hey. - Raine?! - Yeah, it's me. - Okay, hold this. Hang on. - What up? - Hi. Hey. What's up, Raine? - Hey, Max. - Sorry to interrupt you guys. Just wondering if you had anywhere private - we could hang in. - Ah, shit. Bad girl, back on the hit. Don't make a big deal about it. Choose one of the, like, 17 rooms, dude. - Cool. - Knock yourself out, crazy kids. Ouch! I'll wash my hands. Where'd you get all that stuff? I've been collecting it for a while. You know, a piece here and there. Well, you seem organized. I like that. Anything worth doing... is worth doing right. I'd appreciate if you didn't quote my grandma as I'm about to shoot narcotics into my vein. Yeah. Okay. Okay, I'll do this. So... tie this here. - How's that? - Tight. Good. They say it's supposed to be trippy the first time. I bet. Will you do it? You know, you know, I've never done this before either. Yeah. I know, I just, you know, you've watched a lot of videos of people doing it. You've done your research, and I think I'd feel better if you did it. Please? Yeah, okay. You ready? Oh, Raine. Raine. Hey. Babe, hop up, come on. Come here, hey. Woah. Hey. Babe. Raine, Raine, wake up. Raine, come on, come on. Raine, wake up. What more do you need to know? I mean it, fucks up your world. It changes who you are on a core level. You just have to try. Do drugs with me! Do drugs with me. - Do it. - Drop it. - Come on, it'll be fun. - I told you I don't do that stuff anymore. I loved her. Just pretend for one night for me, okay? We should stop. Why don't you just go play house with Max and Raine? I loved her too. Make soup, why don't you go do that? Don't you fucking say that to me. - Okay. - Babe. Oh, that's cool, just like why don't you just die before you even live! I always thought that I blamed you but I blamed myself. I wanted to give you this. Raine's mom gave it to me a long time ago when we were going through some of her stuff. I was going to throw it away but I... I never did. So, when you came by the other day, I couldn't sleep, and I was looking for something to read and there it was. You know, I... I used to think my dad was a superhero. He had this indestructible vibe about him. And this, um, this one time, he told me, "If you want to escape from prison", first you have to admit that you're in prison." You know, freedom was kind of his big thing. Physical freedom, economic freedom... freedom from social taboos. So, he... Imprisoned himself in his own cynicism. He said, uh... that we are all dishonest with ourselves so we can never be honest with each other. Do you think that's true? Are you asking me if I lie to myself? Yeah, I do. It's the only way I know. Do you want a cup of coffee? I'm going to make some, so. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. - Okay. - Thanks. Kali, hi. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Hey, do you want to fly out to meet me? Yeah, I mean, you know, maybe we could drive back together. There's some things I got to tell you about my past. So cold. Come here. Come here. I'm going to take a shower. - Yeah? - Yeah. You want to come? Mm-hmm. - With me? - Yeah. Hey, you know what? You go ahead, I'm just going to check something really quick. Hey, you coming? Max? Baby, your mind is all twisted on this, okay? If you think that I'm going to stand back and watch you trash your life, or like condone it or whatever, you're fucking nuts! Hey, trash... come on. Look, hear me out, okay? What if when we die, we discover, hey, we discover that the goal in life was to simply have as many different experiences as possible?
