[Caleb] We're in the past? [Hunter] Ancient past. Before she became a desert. I don't believe this. Well, believe it. The others need to know that you're here. [Caleb] "The others?"

We don't know how or why, all we know is that we're all stuck in the same pot. [calm music playing] Everything you see here are just... fragments of collected memories.
