The foreigners were awed by the Egyptian Army's courage They dared to attack Alexandria! Saladin taught them a lesson they'll never forget Where is your brother? All people are celebrating his victorious return from Alexandria and he disappears? Look for him Go look for him, Adel The Arab princes welcomed the signing of the allied forces agreement - for liberating Jerusalem - Where's the sultan? I heard he was wounded in the last battle They say that he's ill in bed He may be ill but he hasn't taken to his bed Did you hear what they said? Where is he? Can no one tell us? Where is Saladin? Ismail! Where is your father? Where is the sultan? Everyone awaits him Hikkari, I sense you are anxious and want to tell me something. What is it? - Your Highness, I... - My instincts never fail me Your Highness... so be it Amidst all the celebration and my joy at your victories and all you have done for Egypt one question nags me Has the sultan forgotten the Arabs of Jerusalem? Has he forgotten his oath? The return of Jerusalem to its people The right of the Arabs to their usurped lands? No. Saladin would never forget the Arabs Therefore, the sultan must be hiding a secret even from his old friend No secret, old friend, but a plan The rich bounties of Jerusalem enjoyed by the Crusaders make taking it from them no easy matter We must be well prepared and certain of the unity of our forces to avoid shedding more Arab blood Until today, we weren't fully prepared but now... - This is news to me, sire - You knew what was up Your Highness has genius I have experience - So? - This honorable surprising visit... tells me you bring news The agreement of the Arab princes... - to join forces with us - And... The sultan wants me to accompany him to the palace to discuss the matter After Your Highness Thus, the three warriors destroyed the Crusader battalion My dear... Tell me what had happened during my absence The princes awaited you, but I was very... Has no messenger was sent by an Arab prince or King Al-Saleh? None Commander Hossam Eddin's arrived, sent by the people of Jerusalem Where is he? I told him your Highness would see him the next day - Where is he? - In the library I'll be right back I'll be right back Welcome, commander Hossam Eddin Welcome, welcome! How are you, Hossam? What news of our brothers in Jerusalem? Jerusalem is in a lamentable state You are its last hope Jerusalem awaited you to heed its call Jerusalem lives under siege and fear under continued attacks by the Crusaders They live in terror The smiles that lit children's faces has turned to grief in the hearts of young and old The Arabs of Jerusalem are now mere refugees driven from the land on which they lived for generations They are starving, Your Highness Yet they still dream of salvation They await you Is this water drinkable? Didn't I say that God would not forget you and that you would return victorious to your lands? He has answered our prayers and sent us the liberator Listen... Those are his drums, he has come! It's him I know them, Issa, Abdallah and Hossam Eddin The strict one, the smiling one, and the bold one Our respects, sultan of the Arabs Welcome, brothers in arms There's a place for you in the front ranks This is my son, Ismail He's under your care, Issa. Your nickname is the smiling one Teach him to face danger with a smile - Treat him as an ordinary soldier - Welcome, Issa Welcome to our ranks I hope you'll make us proud Try to learn from each of these men... his best skills The Arabs await you, Your Highness I can't ignore their call I hope to see the Arab nation united under one flag Only then can we liberate Jerusalem From the foreign usurpers With God's blessings With God's blessings, we shall liberate Jerusalem Sire, look How wonderful to see Arabs' hearts united! Sire, my happiness today is that of every Muslim You've made our dream come true by uniting us Our joy will not be complete till we liberate Jerusalem Your ambition knows no bounds, Virginia! Don't throw all responsibilities on your husband Saladin's armies are taking down town after town - His aim is Jerusalem! - Jerusalem will not fall! Don't deprive me of the tender moment of parting Go blame the responsible I'm leaving tonight for Jerusalem to discuss a defense plan with the King Guy You're responsible for what happens now - Renaud? - Virginia I must kiss you goodbye The Governor of Acre still awaits Your Highness - He brings gifts - He can go to hell! - Show him in - Take his gifts then tell him to go away No, let us not turn him away Summon him in, Your Highness Not now, Go away - Renaud - Don't ruin our moment of parting Welcome, dear friend, Governor of Acre Your Highness, Princess Virginia... and Prince Renaud So, Saladin beckons and you run to him Never, I have my pride, Your Highness - It's what I value most - Have a seat, please Our friend answered Saladin's call for unity Not out of weakness, he had to do something to keep Acre What guarantee do we have of your loyalty? Is not my personal confidence in him enough? We shall all return safely, God willing, When the pilgrimage is over May God protect you I shall miss you, but your journey to the holy lands and your visit to the tomb of the Messenger ease the pain of parting Your Highness, The caravan from Mosul has arrived carrying the princess, cousin of King Al-Saleh Why won't you take me with you? You are still young, my son See that the princess has all she requires The safety of the pilgrims is a sacred trust The safety of the cousin of King Al-Saleh is a sacred duty Rest assured, sire She will be cared as if she was your own sister Give my regards to my brother, the prince of Mecca Welcome, Prince Renaud to Jerusalem What is it, Prince of Kerak? Saladin is advancing on Jerusalem, Your Highness He considers it Arab territory and wants to take it Yet, I don't believe he wants take it by force You don't know what's going on there, King of Jerusalem We can always negotiate on Saladin's demands He's unified the Arabs to attack us So, I've decided to take command of our armies - to defend Jerusalem - But... With all respect to Your Majesty's spiritual and royal rights, of course Do you agree? Yes Our coffers are empty - Attack the pilgrim's caravan - No! I've given them my word of safe passage I gave my word of honor He is advancing on us. We need money to defend Jerusalem That's no excuse. Attacking pilgrims is outrageous Saladin protects our own Christian caravans As a Christian, you must respect the treaty This case is different Render to Caesar what belongs to him Attack the caravan and take all the gold and jewels I warn you against such treachery! Wait until their entry into Hejaz During prayers, when they are unarmed... attack them God is Great! God is Great! God is Great! God is Great! Avenge the pilgrims! How can we accept such a thing? We'll take revenge on those murderers But, revenge is not enough We must also ensure the safety of Muslims from tyrants like Renaud History will not say we neglected our duty To Hittin! Nothing will quench my thirst but Saladin's blood Hear how he talks He started this bloody war due to his savage deeds He speaks like a warrior There's no room for mercy in our Holy War The water tanks, are they full? - Yes, Your Majesty. - 2 patrols guard them day and night Very good Our dear Louisa will be Responsible for them I still say our position is vulnerable Since when do officers discuss orders? - I meant that Arabs... - Enough We are in a strategic position on this hill We can easily pounce on the enemy We are high up, The enemy is below us So, which side is vulnerable? The Crusaders are camped on the hilltop in Hittin - Let's kill them - Let's attack them at once Not while they occupy such a high and well-guarded position We'll camp here tonight Hikkari, start the obstacle course training In full battle gear Adel, give orders to set up camp Set up camp! Set up camp! Get some sleep, son It's been an exhausting day Renaud is a clever commander He's a conceited fool We must use his vanity to lure him out into the open and kill him We must force them down from the hill and into the valley But they are 120,000 and we are only 40,000 How many a small company has overcome a large company by Allah's will Therewith, God heartened the faithful during the battle of Badr In that battle, the Messenger achieved victory with 300 faithful men against one thousand infidels The sultan has not announced his plan How lovely it is to swim in lake Tiberius They number more than 120 thousand The sultan must gave some plan for facing such a difficult situation Who wants to come for a swim with me? Will we return without a battle? - I'm going for a swim - We all feel threatened - except Issa - He may have a secret Of course Tell us, That we may be reassured Talk, Issa I know... that the sultan knows Who goes there? - Please, don't come closer - Who are you? I'm a crusader from the Hospitallers A crusader? Show yourself or else... - Surrender, or... - I beseech you! I'm... Get dressed, you are my prisoner now I'll give myself up I beg of you turn around while I dress Turn around and let you escape? Just let me dress, then do whatever you want Get dressed Quickly! My eyes hurt from shutting them Open but don't turn around yet You're taking too long, don't bother making yourself look pretty You're going to jail Be patient. The Arabs are known for their chivalry Give me reason to believe that - You want chivalry - A lesson to you, Arab We'll meet again one day, I'll get my revenge Your last day will be the day we meet again We'll meet Next time my arrow will not pierce your arm... but your heart That arrow could have killed you - God saved me - Tell me the whole truth From which direction did the arrow come? I wanted to take a swim in lake Tiberius I undressed, suddenly there appeared 5 armed Crusaders I was defenseless... - Alone - Scouts? No, they were far from our lines Five Crusaders accosted you while you were undressed? And unarmed They attacked me - I defended myself - With what? A tree... a branch, It was a brave battle on ground - You mean the lake - I fought until... What happened after they shot the arrow? - She ran away - She? The 5 Crusaders were a she? Did I say "she"? You told the truth, Issa Is their camp far from the lake? I could see its lights reflected on the water Assemble the men Here are tanks that are filled from the lake If we destroy them, we'll deprive them of water Thirst will drive them to use most of their troops to forge a way to the lake But the way is open The front's too big to defend with the troops we have Let's narrow that front as much as possible Let's light a line of fire along the front to prevent their advance They will have only the pass The arrogant Renaud will try to overrun the pass Then we will engage The Muslims won the battle of Badr with a similar plan. God help you Tonight, while Renaud thinks we're exhausted from travelling We'll start by destroying the tanks - Me, sire! - Who is better than the swimmer? Are you sure, your health state will allow you to undertake the mission? Thanks to your treatment, my wounds are healed, sire Don't deprive me of the honor of doing battle With god's blessing We need good swimmers to sneak in being their lines by way of the lake... which you've become familiar with from here, Hossam... you and the Strict One wait for Issa at the tanks at dawn Gather your men and go to the lake at once Guards! Be on the alert Everything's fine Orders... always orders! Forward, men! This is hell! Where's the water? I need water! Water! Saladin will pay dearly for this He will pay for daring to challenge Renaud Time is still on our side I can still persuade Saladin to agree to a reconciliation A reconciliation? I knew you were a defeatist, but not this extent Can there be a worse defeat than this? Defeat? The battle hasn't begun! Since the tanks have been empty, you alone drink and don't think of others My men can take it I must drink in order to lead them to victory You're throwing them into battle with parched throats? Thirst will induce them to fight better But we can negotiate with Saladin If we ask Conrad of Montferrat to come to our aid with his men Hittin battle will be the decisive battle Otherwise, we'll lose Jerusalem Renaud needs help from no one I can wipe out the Arabs single-handed erase them from existence! I'll never allow my men to die of thirst on a hilltop Prepare to attack! I'll enter Jerusalem before sundown... with Saladin's head at the end of my sword Renaud's soldiers are dying of thirst Now they will have to leave their positions We'll force them through the narrow pass by raising walls of flame there... and there to close off the other passes Make sure the wood you use is dry Arabs, this is the decisive battle Renaud attacked unarmed pilgrims disregarding all treaties It is our holy duty to wipe him out and send him to hell, where he belongs! Let every beat of the drum Declare the end of treason, injustice and oppression Beat the drums! Beat the drums! As soon as they set foot in the pass, we'll execute out plan Let's see if our obstacle course training has been useful You want me in the pass, so be it I'm coming But you'll be sorry, Saladin Prepare to attack the pass! I warn you, Renaud That would be sheer madness! Surely, Renaud isn't afraid of Barbarians I'm coming to you, Saladin! Their forces are moving into the pass I'll take the center, you take the right flank - Yes - Take your position Adel, hide with your men to the left Don't attack until they fill the pass completely Take your positions Left flank, forward! The rear flanks are in position and await your orders Tell Hossam to signal at the right moment Attack! Follow Renaud to the pass Retreat Attack! Saladin is at the gates of Jerusalem Jerusalem must not be lost! I would be your end, Your majesty, and ours You must fight to the end Throw the rest of the men into battle What men? Your stupid husband threw... our bravest warriors into the clutches of the lion Those who didn't die of thirst perished in the battle How can you accept defeat? Jerusalem is lost and your husband taken prisoner My husband's fate does not concern me But Jerusalem will not be lost I shall seek help... From the kings of England, France and Germany They will never allow the Holy City... to fall into Saladin's hands Put up some resistance till I return Don't forget your sacred duty Death will be the end of all this The sultan's son, let's kill him Retreat! Retreat! God is great! God is great! I'm Renaud! I'm Renaud! I should not be treated like this! Where are my men? - God is great - God is great God is great You're Christian, yet you fight with them? They are my brothers - I'm an Arab - And your brothers in Christianity? Those who use the cross as an excuse... to invade my land are not brothers May I ask you what your name is? Louisa de Lusignan, commander of the Hospitallers What if your men saw their commander crying? - What's your name? - Issa They kill the Muslims without mercy! Your soldiers snatch babies from their mothers' arms Leave her come forward You who claim wisdom Return my only daughter to me My daughter was kidnapped by Constantine's soldiers and sold in the slave market Constantine's soldiers are not mine, calm down Look for the child and return her to her mother... at any price, I shall pay it And you, understand that our law here is justice and mercy All are free to worship in their faith Religion belongs to God and the motherland is for all I shall count on you, Governor of Acre to send my message to Prince Conrad One of men will meet him tonight and deliver your message to him When the message and campaign funds reach him he'll not hesitate to come to our aid If he asks for more money... - give it to him - But... When I return with the European kings I'll pay you back... and more Are you prepared? I'll be here to welcome you and the kings of Europe Acre, its army and its governor will always be at the service... of the beautiful Virginia, I always keep my promises And Virginia will not forget her promise... to make you King of Jaffa King of Acre and Jaffa Water, water! A glass of water Where's the water? You drank alone, now you scream alone We're all thirsty, yet you alone call for water Long live the great sultan! Long live the liberator of Jerusalem! Jerusalem Returned to the Arabs! - Water, we want water! - Haven't the prisoners drunk yet? They all have drunk except their commanders I was awaiting your orders Have you no mercy? Give them water at once Read out our edict Equality for all Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem Liberation of all prisoners of war for a ransom of... 10 dinars per man and 5 per woman Pilgrimage to Jerusalem is authorized to all Christians Will we be condemned to prison or death? When an Arab gives you water It means he's given you your life In the name of Christ, I thank you, sultan Thank him? Shut the old fool up Where the hell is that water? Didn't he order the water to be brought? You drink the water, yet it's against my will You're used to quenching your thirst with blood Though, I'm a prisoner, and I must be treated with respect Saladin treats you like you used to treat his unarmed subjects Remember the pilgrims? Had I my sword, no one would dare talk to me this way - Give him a sword - He doesn't deserve a duel He deserves death He's my prisoner, I alone have the right to kill him Renaud fights only an equal... a king He's challenging you, Saladin Renaud shall be killed by a lowly servant of God Take it If I could punish him for all his crimes I'd kill him a thousand times over Christian children are dying of thirst Pilgrims to Jerusalem are slaughtered Places of worship are being destroyed... The old monks driven out into the desert Those, who escaped Saladin, were devoured by wild beasts What is it, Arthur? Listen to the beautiful lady from the East If King Richard should leave for the East, It would be your opportunity to seize the throne The throne of England, Prince John If he liberates Jerusalem and returns victorious, who would dare stand against him? The martyrs' throne has returned The sun shall not set on your shame The Arabs will never occupy Jerusalem as long as there lives a Christian knight - called Richard the Lion-Heart - If he comes back If he never returns, my dear Arthur, Rest assured I'll crown you King of Jerusalem, Beside the lovely lady That's a promise Your Majesty, allow me the honor of putting... my sword and men in the service of Christendom It is our duty to lead this crusade While you manage the affairs of our dear England Madam, if you please Come, Princess Virginia A war council will be held at once I, Richard the Lion-Heart, declares a holy war to liberate Jerusalem Long live King Richard! Saladin set the prisoners free and even paid the ransom of whoever were unable to ransom themselves - but he has forgotten me - The sultan has chosen you to become the companion of his dearest commander, Issa A companion? You mean a slave girl? He should have had the courage to tell me that rather than force me into it Louisa, I don't consider you a slave I'm a crusader If I was unfortunate enough to be taken prisoner, I should be treated as a prisoner of war not a slave girl given to you by your sultan You will not be a slave I ask you to be my wife I, the wife of an Arab? Were it not a mortal sin, I would kill myself first If you want to leave, I won't stop you Louisa Louisa Why do you look upon us as deadly enemies? Jerusalem must remain in our hands We are the custodians of Christianity Jerusalem has always been an Arab land Our history proves that we can rule it in peace and with respect You'd rather follow those to whom religion is a trade Who turn the holy place into markets... to swindle the poor Pay for blessings The money goes into Europe's coffers Anyone who poses a threat to these profits faces fire, war and death Blackmail in the name of the Holy Scripture Louisa, you've always been loyal I am a better Christian than you I believe that taking what is not mine is an unforgivable sin My belief in justice is the basis of my faith Louisa Your Majesty, all the treasures of the East... have been seized by Saladin All those riches can be yours, king of France If you liberate Jerusalem What will be the share of the lovely princess? After the expulsion of Saladin, you will surely need someone to rule Jerusalem in your name I am at the service of the King of France Virginia Richard is very proud and haughty Do you think he'll cause trouble? We must be cautious Prince Conrad of Montferrat will wait for us near Acre The magic of the East seems to have bewitched him - Francois - Your Majesty - Is Acre still far? - It is within sight Thank you 10 leagues to go Acre is within sight! Prepare for battle, we must take Acre before sunset Prepare to attack! The fort of Acre Acre opens its arms to receive us And just beyond it lie hidden... the treasures of the kingdom of Jerusalem Jerusalem City of the olive groves Through which walked Christ, our savior Your Highness, the Crusaders are attacking Acre with a mighty fleet Take the nets and take refuge behind the walls Hurry You, to the right side. Take the children to the left quickly - Are you ready to resist? - yes Ismail Go inform the sultan Hussein, hurry to Jerusalem and inform the sultan of the Crusaders' attack by sea You will take part in the defense of the city with Issa's division Richard the Lion-Heart Philippe Auguste, King of France Bohemond, Prince of Antioch They're disembarking, shall we strike? Wait for the signal It's a colossal force Let's attack The sultan has taught us to win battles with patience Attack! What is the commander waiting for? To the left I said to the left The Crusaders' fleet is attacking Acre Send reinforcements to Acre at once Who leads the Crusaders? Richard, King of England - Richard? - Richard the Lion-Heart? He eats two sheep for his supper I heard he duelled with 100 men at once, and killed them all! Arabs! Europe has sent its most precious sons to you, its cleverest commanders Prepare! He who dies in battle is destined for paradise Remember, your fathers beat whom were stronger than Richard and his men The first regiment has been wiped out Send the second and the third Follow me, quickly Follow me, quickly - We've run out of arms - Take out what's left in the stores Where are the weapons? - We need weapons! - Where are the weapons? Bring out the weapons! Quickly What are you doing... Guards! Open the gates Welcome, Virginia I kept my word. It's your turn to keep yours Later Where are the weapons, Mohamed? Treason... treason! Go on! Finish the story about the Arab miser They cut off his hands He threw himself on his stash of jewels and money "My money!", he screamed "My children's future!" Then He grabbed the box with his feet So, my men cut off his feet In the end, the men had to kill him to get the box And what did we found in the box? - Thousands - No Think... think... 50 dinars and one jewel fitting only for the lovely Virginia Does Louisa not admire the jewel? The whole thing is nothing to me I heard that Louisa, commander of the Hospitallers, has decided not to take part in battles and put all her efforts into nursing What's the secret behind that? You're too careworn for your age, my dear You're different from my friend, Louisa who visited us in England 2 years ago and filled our trips with fun and laughter How my husband, the king, admired you! Now, you're sad, always silent Open your heart to me Talk to me as your friend, not the queen of England It helps to talk to a friend Your Highness... The battle of Acre was more of a picnic... than a real war Let's drink to the memory of the great king Barbarossa who met his tragic death on the way to Jerusalem To Barbarossa! - A drink, Your Majesty? - No, thank you Another drink? The king of Acre is serving us himself The king of Acre is always at your service Has Your Majesty received bad news? The princes of Bourges, Poitiers and Tours have taken advantage of my absence to revolt I'll have their heads cut when I return to France You shall succeed in ending the revolt I cannot go back without the keys to Jerusalem the riches of the East, and the pride of victory Only thus you can save your throne and win the blessings of the Pope as well The Pope's blessings will bring you endless contributions Philippe never forgets those who help him Help me conquer Jerusalem, and I'll put you on its throne - with the lovely Virginia - Your Highness I have found for my beautiful friend a knight... worthy to share with her the throne of Jerusalem - Your Majesty - As for me, I was hesitant I thank the king for choosing the loveliest of ladies to share with me the throne Why aren't you at the banquet? I'm planning something, dear Arthur I can no longer hold arms against them for fear of killing him He who so generously spared my life - You've fallen in love - No, I'm just a good Christian Has the king set the date for the march to Jerusalem? The way lies open. In two or three day... We'll deliver Jerusalem from the barbarians But first, we'll have to leave a French garrison at Acre Not that I don't trust the governor of Acre I mean the king of Acre and Jaffa A garrison will help him keep order French? Why not a British garrison? The choice is mine and Virginia's since credit for the fall of Acre is ours I shall always remember the services of the governor To the governor! King of Acre and Jaffa King of Acre and Jaffa With your intelligence I assume you realize that it was the Arabs' fear of Richard that enabled us to occupy Acre No need to squabble There are enough riches for all of us Do you think of nothing but loot and treasure O guardians of the cross? The Holy War is not over yet "Think not of those slain for God's cause as dead, they live" "finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord" "Those days we alternate among people" God speaks the truth Grieve not Condolences for Hekkari and the martyrs of Acre We are all fated to die Defeat and victory are in the hands of God What's unforgivable is that the women's tears are the result of treachery Your Highness... Brother The sultan is no state to receive anyone I have a message from King Richard You won the battle of Acre by... Abdallah, Issa Let him enter Read out your message King Richard the Lion-Heart of England King Philippe Auguste of France In the name of the kings and princes of Europe And the warriors of the cross will await Sultan Saladin at sunrise to start negotiations for peace and stop spilling more Arab blood Tell them Saladin will negotiate to spare the blood of the Arabs as well as that of the Crusaders The invitation is worded offensively Their false victory has made them conceited It's not proper that you go to their camp The meeting should be held on neutral ground - They think we're weakened - After the easy fall of Acre If it's true that Richard came here to protect the Christians and not to seek riches, it will be easy to reach an agreement Well said, Prepare the sultan's retinue No retinue Appearances are not necessary for advocates of truth - We'll leave that to them - But... - No, Issa, I'll go with no retinue - Sire... Richard is not like the others It's for him for alone that I shall go Impossible, I won't budge to meet that barbarian Whose hands are stained with the blood of Christians Your Highness must make any sacrifice in order to win peace Your meeting with Saladin may save Christians from the horrors of war Richard the Lion-King is a great king Saladin doesn't deserve the honor of meeting him The hopes of Eastern Christians depend on this meeting The future of Christians is not decided by highway robbers I've decided not to meet him Go, Arthur My dear Virginia Conrad is coming He sent 3 emissaries only, an insult to the kings of Europe Let's send him back their corpses - Saladin himself! - With no guards, no retinue It's an insult Peace be upon you Philippe Auguste, king of France and commander of the French armies Conrad of Montferrat Arthur, Robert, duke of Flanders William, prince of Swabia - Henri of Champagne - Godfrey, duke of Normandy Henry of York Robert, duke of Leicester Keeper of the gold shield of Alexis II emperor of Byzantium, commander of the Knights Templar Saladin, servant of God, and of the Arabs If you want peace, here are our terms Since when do aggressors impose conditions on the legitimate owners? You started this war If you want peace, leave our territories Is this a declaration of war? I hate war Islam and Christianity condemn spilling of blood Yet, we shall fight if necessary to save our land War is the only option As honorable warriors, we do not want to take advantage of your defeat We offer you peace in return for Jerusalem and all Christian provinces Why should we give up parts of our nation? In order to safeguard your country... and your life So it's war, then in the name of justice What justice? King Richard The bold warrior Richard the Lion-Heart Had you not come to our land with these aggressors I'd have welcomed you Whole-heartedly Richard does not accept welcome from a bandit chief who persecutes Christians, defiles the grave of Christ, and dares to occupy Jerusalem Who told you that Saladin, believer in all holy books, persecutes Christians and defiles Christ's grave? Jerusalem belongs to the Arabs The holy shrines are open to those of all religions You claim bravery and honesty, yet you deny your persecution of Christians while your hands are yet stained with the blood... of poor Renaud It doesn't surprise me that Renaud's widow would resort to anything Be careful, you're addressing a lady We know how to address ladies But I'm speaking to her as the warrior who abetted Renaud You pretend to be tolerant while your hands drip with Christian blood I will let a Christian do the talking My best general and closest friend, Issa Religion belongs to God and the motherland is for all A hired mercenary Conrad knows those who can be bought As for me, I hire no mercenaries King Richard, for the last time I offer you peace And I offer you, for the last time, Either an unconditional surrender or war War! War! Does that mean that King Richard rejects peace? My conscience would never rest at ease while the city of olive groves is in Arab hands Yet, you burn the olive branches On the road to victory you will hail Richard the Lion-Heart They outnumber us by far yet we shall attack them from behind these walls What are your walls against our towers? Call the sultan at once They have giant moving towers unlike anything we've seen We must stop the towers from reaching our walls before they use them to climb up We must burn them at once Do what you will, our towers are immune to fire Try again! - Shoot the burning arrows - Shoot the burning arrows Try again! Forward, soldiers of the cross! Retreat We had to give up Ashkelon to save our men This tragedy will be repeated... each time they attack a town with those towers We'll never be able to face them Except outside the walls Richard's aim is Jerusalem There are several roads leading to Jerusalem We'll lure them to the road leading to this swamp There we'll meet them The way Saladin let us take Ashkelon so easily doesn't match the arrogance he met us with He fled from Ashkelon, Caesarea and Jaffa Didn't I tell you this was a picnic? I guess I'll be returning soon to France We should head directly to Jerusalem Not before we destroy Saladin himself otherwise, he won't leave things to settle down We must destroy Saladin to ensure our victory Our plan is to destroy him So, why not head directly to Jerusalem? Saladin's death will bring Arab resistance to an end So, the means to victory is the destruction of Saladin Sire, Saladin's troops are nearing They're within sight You'll return to France sooner than you anticipated Issa The crusaders are within sight I want the biggest dust cloud ever Faster, faster! I'm sure the dust came from that direction - It came from the right - Pardon men, from the left Left or right, he was here - He's escaped - Let him escape Look If we draw a line between this sword and that shield it will show their position You're a genius, my dear Conrad Hurry, Abdallah, give me anything - I have nothing - Your belt, quickly Attack! There are the Arab devils! Forward! Forward! Attack! Come on, Arabs We were as light as birds without armor While they, in their armor, moved like camels! One warrior saw me fighting him with no armor and fell down in a faint You should've seen Commander Hossam moving through their lines Did he? Yes, he's resting in his tent He commander isn't back from the battle Her beautiful eyes slayed me and refused to give me a new life A verse from a love ode starting with "N" Now we attack the enemy Enough attacks, I'm talking love Nay, I suffer from secret longing But one, such as me, gives not away his feelings Come on, Issa What's wrong, Abdallah? Join the game. A love verse starting with "R" Abdallah... I assure you, Ismail and Hossam will return It's being said Prince Ismail was killed in battle Along with commander Hossam Who has spread this black rumor? We expect their return at any moment How could you even utter such words, Abdallah? How can you dampen their joy at our victory? Those soldiers aren't celebrating their victory nor that they survived They're pretending to laugh, fearing the news may be true Could it be that the sultan himself is worried? Since the battle, he's kept to his tent and done nothing but work on his experiments Ismail and Hossam must come back Commander Hossam is here Where's Ismail? - I closed his eyes myself - Impossible! Ismail is alive! Ismail is alive! Curse these towers! Curse this war! Does it have kill all those we love? Damn! Damn it all! I tell you he's alive Dry your tears, Issa. We've defeated the enemy Thank God you are back safe, Hossam Return to your celebration Come, Hossam Give me forbearance, O Lord We've been fooled about that man, Saladin We believed him to be a savage His military plan proved he is a great strategist King Richard has time to teach him a lesson A truce? This truce is a waste of time Better to keep advancing Time is not in favor of those being persecuted there, the victims of Saladin Recently, we've already occupied many Arab towns Yes, but at what price? We need this truce to plan ahead and strengthen our forces Truce? Setting new plans requires time. Better to keep advancing No matter how many more soldiers are massacred? In war, kings should not worry about the number of dead, victory what matters most For a victorious king, war means glory And for the ordinary soldiers, even victorious ones, it means death We must think of them before anything else and more than we think of ourselves or any worldly gains With such views we'll never take Jerusalem in time We must take it at any cost and then negotiate a truce No man will remain alive to set foot in the holy city - I speak as the leader... - I refuse the truce I say we vote to continue the war - I vote in agreement - And I Then I shall retreat with my men You will bear before God and Christ the consequences of your madness There's no hope for victory if Richard withdraws You are forcing your way on the majority Prepare to send Saladin a delegation of English men He'll never comply with the truce We'll observe the truce for 6 month - Confess - I swear to you he is a Christian Still, he is an Arab, you put your hands in his But I swear he is Christian If we had the courage of the Templars, we would wipe out the Arabs without hesitation Six months The heroes of the past when they faced an obstacle would jump on their horses and run through the woods Let's get away from Richard's suffocating atmosphere To Sultan Saladin, right away Virginia The war must continue The truce must be stopped Or else... What if we stopped Richard's emissaries from reaching Saladin? They are on their own way to Saladin It could be arranged upon their return from Acre In this case, there won't be any truce The Templars would do anything to stop anyone from delaying the Holy War even murder Saladin is bidding the emissaries farewell It seems he agreed to the truce They will set us free, then No hope for a Christian in the hands of Muslims But He offered them gifts - What's your name? - Bernard - Soldier? - I'm a mercenary - You? - I'm a sword maker And you? A knight of the Temple, I presume What about you? Relax I'm a peasant from Normandy You should plant fields instead of sowing grief - Have you any children? - Four I meant to make soldiers of them I hope to return safe and teach them what I learned here Teach them to plant fields instead Before going home I'd like to visit Jerusalem You will soon We've accepted the truce It's a step towards peace Send their corpses to Richard We'll see if he doesn't change his mind Here is Saladin's answer How can we deal with such barbarians? We must fight until we destroy them all Let's attack them at once It means that Saladin have started to march towards us Order the attack, Lion-Heart Before he takes us by surprise by his dirty tricks Let's begin by killing the Arab prisoners The best response to Saladin is to kill the prisoners Saladin killed your emissaries at a time, We need every soldier, We cannot spare soldiers to guard 3000 Arabs Order the execution of the prisoners Order their execution The war will continue. Bring all the prisoners No, Your Majesty! Your Majesty! The Christian prisoners have returned - Lies! - They're all coming Your Highness - It must be a trick - They're all coming back They killed our emissaries and King Richard's bravest warriors Richard will lose his truce with Salah Your Majesty! In the name of Christ and peace I beseech you to free all Arab prisoners as Saladin freed us Shoot! Saladin sent gifts with your emissaries - Is this how you thank him? - My emissaries? Stop! I, Richard the Lion-Heart, order all soldiers to withdraw King of France, I'll expect you in my tent Richard the Lion-Heart never spares those who double cross him What are you mumbling about, Duke? If the departure of Philippe grieves you, a ship is waiting in the harbor with room for dozens Any of you regret his departure can leave with him On my honor I'll stop no one from leaving I'll even send an emissary to see him off He's drunk Thank God Philippe's soldiers are still with us What about the lovely Virginia? Does his departure sadden you, too? No, I was saying that the French army didn't depart with the king Even should the French army depart, as long as I lead you in battle singlehanded... Certainly, singlehanded Then I shall lead you to the victory But the knights of the Templar have withdrawn with Philippe They have been dismissed along with Philippe Don't ever mention them again Their hands are tainted with the blood of innocent prisoners They have brought shame to us all If you don't trust in me... It's said that Saladin agreed to the truce Saladin welcomes the truce And on this occasion, I, Richard the Lion-heart, after what I have seen have decided to take command of all the Crusader armies Only thus will I agree to bear responsibility for the Holy War But our front are weakened, now that our numbers have decreased Decreased? We have the armies of 12 European countries You're afraid, Duke The strength of our front isn't estimated by its size... but by its unity and strength Have you learned nothing from the enemy yet? - Allow me to reassure the fearful kings & princes - Go ahead I will tell them that the great prince John reinforcements will reach us before the end of the truce Tell them what you want Just do what you can to replace their hearts... with lions' hearts And there are more reinforcements from the King of Germany - will reach us before the end of the truce, too - No! Order a prayer of thanks, Your Holiness as we were saved, before it was too late, from committing the sin of killing thousands of innocent prisoners May all who tainted the holy flag with innocent blood be cursed We'll hold prayers till tomorrow when King Richard... I am always ready to pray Do it now! I want to know if our moves are blessed or cursed If my presence is no longer wanted please order me to withdraw Finish what you were saying King Richard apologizes for what happened You mean killing 70 prisoners He doesn't consider this unwilful mistake a breaking of the truce So, he wants the truce to continue despite killing 70 innocents Killing prisoners is not King Richard's way, we know We accept his apology and adherence to the truce - We pardon him - He who can pardon can also punish Please give him this gift as a token of our pardon and adherence to the truce I don't believe King Richard wants your He's not a lowly subject seeking pardon but a great warrior king who has made a slight error Tell your king we accept his apology That man hates Richard - Conrad? - I am Arthur, Conrad's master - Duke Arthur - Virginia It's a beautiful night How bewitching are the nights of the East Such nights were made for love, my beauty How dare you enter my tent and speak to me this way? You are speaking to a princess, not an alley girl Playing with Conrad is dangerous I'm advising, not threatening Richard is more alert than you imagined - What do you mean? - Arthur holds his silence Had he wanted to talk he would have sooner I know you are intelligent and prudent Conrad can't be depended on He knows nothing about love and sacrifice Come to my tent, let us talk in more privacy Remember, Arthur, the future king of Jerusalem will choose the beautiful Virginia to share his throne Come with me to my tent With you? To your tent? We are one of a kind, our aim is one Cooperating with me will be more profitable for you You disgust me Get out! One night, less beautiful than this one, you'll come crawling to me - Until that night - Out, before I call the guards My regards to your handsome knight Conrad Read the Damascene's letter He has perfected his invention, a liquid... - which will destroy the enemy towers - At last - Thank God for that! - The hour of vengeance is near May Ismail rest in peace The Damascene is unable to leave Acre, he's closely watched He could come by sea but he will need me, the swimmer Get ready. Take this ring; it will tell him that you're a friend You two, carry out the other mission Yes, sir A liquid that sets the towers on fire May our victims rest in peace. To Acre - Our patrol is over - To the tavern There's the ship that's taking Philippe back Good riddance! - Meat - Go away Go away? Go away I'm going to go read the king of France's palm I might reveal the reason for his defeat in East I want to find it full when I return You remind me of the only woman I ever loved She had the same sad eyes. We'd planned to marry But only God knows when I will return Am I destined to die in a foreign land? Richard has appointed his friend Arthur to see you off The situation is dire We need some gains to justify this failure of a war and the huge taxes we imposed to finance the campaign Can any gains be made as long as Richard is in charge? Listen, Conrad... Don't think of tomorrow. Enjoy today This wine is for king Philippe - I require a big favor from you - Pay for it first Listen Abdou, Abdou If France were able to conquer some Crusader provinces and found a Crusader state Saladin's only concern is to maintain Jerusalem Let him keep Jerusalem in return for Kerak, Ashkelon, Jaffa, Acre and Saida I'm certain he'll agree to avoid more hardship Tonight I will send the offer to Saladin Rest assured, sire Tonight, an emissary from them delivers their offer to Saladin Their voice was low, but I heard them talking about... handing over Jerusalem to Saladin Patrol is over, Forward, march! It pleases me that your face is the last memory I take with me from the East - Who is it? - Me - Open up - God help you I'm not a beggar, I'm Issa, here's the sultan's ring Issa, the swimmer? How did you come? I swam, I came on the sultan's order to take you and your invention back with me Quickly, there's no time But the foreigners are watching the roads Hurry up! Leave this to me - Quickly - May God be with us! - Who's there? - A spy on the run! catch him, John Hurry up - Run - What about you? Run, The important thing is that you reach the sultan To the king himself Jerusalem betrayed for few crowns? Just like Christ was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver Judas has risen from the dead Is this the Holy War in which thousands of our sons die? Lord, we thank You for saving your pious son Richard What punishment does such treason deserve? Rest easy, sire Thank God your brave friend Arthur... - discovered the treachery in time - Is that how knights do battle? Is this an honorable campaign? Treason and treachery! What difference is there between Saladin and the pagan emperor who paid 30 dinars for the arrest of Christ? We still don't know what Saladin's answer is You nearly trusted him the day he returned the prisoners We never fooled ourselves as to the baseness of Arabs But the attitude of the French has shocked us Send one of your most loyal men to the king with this same message When we receive Saladin's reply, you shall face Conrad with it You speak of Saladin's morality We shall see, my queen A man drowning He is Christian, he wears a cross Such a pleasant way to while away the time during the truce Treating patients is a sacred duty not a pastime A form of prayer? A form of prayer none but the purest of heart would understand Will you enter a convent after the war? It's the man they saved from drowning You may go, I'll stay with him I put down my arms and I just want to be a nurse to avoid facing such a dreadful situation Dear lord, if you're giving me such experience don't give me more pain than I can bear At last Your tent amidst the wounded camp, I can't bear it Better to be away from Richard's spies I don't care about Richard or his spies I will await you in my tent Conrad, I... Fine. Until another night when Richard's spies sleep You're Virginia's guest tonight The beautiful Virginia Are you afraid? Conrad of Montferrat... I've decided to kill Richard If we don't, he'll bring back Guy and put him on the throne of Jerusalem Richard can't be killed on a mere whim Admit that you don't have the guts I didn't wait to hear more insults I'm sure Richard knows that Philippe killed his emissaries and of our rule in it Louisa! Does your prayer and piety mean spying on others? Where am I? Louisa! Louisa! I was certain... I was certain we would meet Divine providence put us in each other's way it's impossible to escape God's will Why would she spy on us? That girl knows more than she should I don't like that girl The likes of her can't be trusted How can you consider this a divine victory? I'm not saying you should accept giving up all your provinces in exchange for Jerusalem - but in principle... - I have principles, too How dare you suggest we end the war in such a demeaning manner? If a foreign king offers to withdraw from the war in battle in return for some personal gain I say we shouldn't refuse and demand him to settle his differences with his allies You think Saladin could trust a king who betrays even his allies? The Messenger himself won victories by sowing dissension between his enemies As the Messenger said, war is trickery The Messenger was in the midst of battle He had no choice We are observing a truce We must not rejoice in a victory given... by a Christian king over the bodies of his brothers After I find a way to break the truce and Richard's men engage in the midst of battle he withdraws, leaving his allies unprotected Such a victory would be shameful! We don't fight over a patch of land but for the triumph of moral and spiritual values If they betray each other, why not take advantage? How can you, as a politician, trust a man who betrays his own cause and people? Lies to his allies? He is certainly incapable of honoring his pact with you We suffered a great deal from treason... and despised the victories gained by our enemy through treason Remember Acre Write to king Conrad, Tell him that... though he does not deserve the honour of an answer, the Arabs want to teach the foreigners that a defeat with honour is better than a dishonorable victory If Your Highness will allow me... Come in, Damascene I have a limited quantity of this liquid Show us - A real feat - Thanks Jerusalem will be their next target Make sure the Damascene has everything he needs to produce a large quantity of this liquid Thank you, sire What news of the swimmer? It's too dangerous for you to be here Is that all you can say... after our long separation? I see another Louisa, strange, distant... Where are you? I don't feel you with me I don't feel your heart beating When we last met, as you tried you lose yourself in the crowds I felt your presence I felt you wanted to be with me You were with me despite pretending otherwise You were with me, Louisa And now where are you, Louisa? You are beside me, yet I feel you're far away Did we meet again to say goodbye? You gave me my freedom, I shall now pay back my debt Now that your wound has healed you must leave Saladin's seal... So, he's an Arab Guards! Louisa Louisa Come with me Arrest this spy I knew that your piety was a front... for cowardice of the lowest degree in order to avoid going into battle, we should've known You helped Saladin's spy escape? Why? He's the lover of Louisa the pure! Only God knows that I'm not sinful You will appear before the military tribunal Your fate will be that of witches You will burn! Thus Louisa has fallen O kings and princes of Europe, who have left your countries leading your armies here across the seas to take back the holy land of Christ from the enemies of the cross... Louisa betrayed you That's what Louisa has been reduced to I throw myself at your mercy Bow down to none other than your God Have mercy on me for the sake of my children Did you think of others when you gave up Acre to the invaders? Leaving them to wipe the smiles off children's faces? No one except Louisa denies that Saladin is anything but a savage Only Louisa objects to that Saladin has been generous with his prisoners Arabs are not barbarians thus, it's not shameful to deal with them She no longer has the sacred hate in her heart Your heart is like a city without walls You have uprooted love from your heart You hate your country and Arabism, and gave up Acre The enemy found a way to her heart She gave her Christian body to an Arab, threw herself into his arms She has forgotten our sacred hatred for them without it we will never be victorious It was hatred that made you throw yourself forgetting the traditions of the honorable war, our noble traditions love others that God may have mercy on you Love has replaced the sacred hatred in your heart The hatred in your life has driven out love Don't let compassion mislead your from duty - of killing this woman - No... Do you not understand... that with this deed you've condemned your brothers to death? There's no victory without hate - And no liberation without love - Let us rekindle our sacred hate Down with hatred! To the stake! Burn her like a witch Let the Lord's will be done This must be the God's punishment... for all those who have betrayed Jerusalem Their flesh dissolves as they remain standing Damnation to you, Conrad! Take off your mask By the Lord's will all masks fall off You betrayed Jerusalem, you betrayed us, the future of our kings and princes You betrayed the blood of our martyrs who came to place the cross on the tomb of Christ The curse of God will follow you to the grave The Arab have refused your filthy conspiracy Saladin has refused to cooperate with you O kings and princes, Read the proof of treason May God smite those who conspire against Jerusalem We shall give you traitors' punishment "The punishment of those who betray trusts" "conspire against their brothers, spread dissent" "and wreak havoc" "is death" Behead the traitor! O Lord, may Christmas pass peacefully The sultan has condemned the Acre traitor to death - He's right - Because of him Sultan Saladin... - has rejected Conrad's offer - King Richard understand that now - I want... - Issa the swimmer has arrived! - Where is he? - At the gate - What? - Issa is here Tell commander Abdallah Welcome, Issa! Welcome Go to the sultan at once Your Highness, commander Issa has arrived - Issa - Your Highness Welcome to Jerusalem of the Arabs Thank God the Damascene arrived here safely The sultan knows that without your help... I never would have arrived My brother, to complete the Arab's joy, go to King Richard Invite him to visit Jerusalem for Christmas His Highness cannot refuse the invitation The king hasn't said anything yet Your king can speak for himself King Al-Adel, Tell Sultan Saladin... I will tell him whatever you want Tell him that Richard thanks him for the invitation and will decide shortly Why not accept it now? You are invited as a Christian pilgrim You'll get an answer before sunset Come that you may see how the Christians live in freedom Thank you Whatever your replay may be, it is our custom as Arabs to reply to any salutation with a better one Peace be upon you Peace be upon you Our salutation is peace as you can see Saladin chooses his emissaries well If you accept, how can you have the heart to fight them to the end? Accepting the invitation means nothing Why must we fight them to the end? Because Jerusalem is ours. Thus decreed Christ Christ did not decree that Jerusalem belongs to the likes of Conrad and Philippe Christ damned the likes of them on Mount of Olives What are you saying? Should we leave Jerusalem to Saladin? Saladin is an honorable man He refused Conrad's offer to give him Richard's head He doesn't persecute Christians as we heard He guarantees them freedom of worship Why then should we drive thousands of our soldiers to the slaughter? - What would we gain? - Hear me all martyrs of Christianity The queen of England, wife of the Lion-Heart Richard, defender of the cross, wants to give Jerusalem to the enemies of Christ! I, as a Christian queen, after spending a year here in the East, prefer that Jerusalem remain in the hands of a just king of any religion than falling into the hands of treacherous, immoral Christians What about our bride? What about the glory that awaits King Richard? The garlands being woven for you in Europe The bells ringing in your honor in every European capital All of Europe awaits your return with the key to Jerusalem, Richard's return with the kingdom of Jerusalem The king has not yet replied Will he ask for a reconciliation, as the queen wants and return to Europe in defeat? From what terrible hell do you come by your words? The Lion-Heart must raise his flag over Jerusalem Richard's flag high over Jerusalem Tell Saladin, I'll visit Jerusalem in two days That doesn't mean peace If he wants peace, let him give up Jerusalem Virginia, listen - Jerusalem - City of the living God - Richard! - Treason! An Arab poisoned arrow killed Richard His blood won't go in vain We must have the heads of the murderers Richard's blood shall be avenged! With an Arab arrow. Salute - King Richard is dead - Long live King John! The truce has come to an end In a few days the lovely Virginia will share the throne of Jerusalem with Arthur Saving Richard means saving face from the accusation of killing a man to whom we promised safe passage Why don't you send him your doctor to treat and tell him what you want? No. I'll look after him myself It would be dangerous for the sultan to go to the European's camp They have sworn vengeance on all Arabs Our good reputation is more important than my life so are thousands of Arabs' lives that threatened by vengeance Adel, be on your guard I hope we're not forced to fight Allow me to accompany you I know who can take us to Richard There has been treason King Richard has been killed with an Arab poisoned arrow The only response to that treason... is to kill them all Not one Arab shall be spared Avenge from who have violated the truce Avenge from who have breached the pledge O soldiers of the Lion-Heart Avenge your king! Don't spare anyone Kill them all, men, women and children! Liberate Jerusalem! Their treachery must be avenged Richard's death must be avenged To hoist Richard's flag over Jerusalem, we must unite our forces Will you leave Jerusalem in the hands of the Arabs? Their treachery deserves revenge There's no hope for him except a miracle from Heaven The sultan of Muslims comes to save Richard Pray that his recovery may be at the hands of a humble man O soldiers In this tent lies King Richard, victim of treason Avenge the death of your king, victim of vile treachery! Avenge every drop of his blood by taking the lives of hundreds of Arabs - Revenge! - We all would die for you, Richard At sunrise, let's teach the Arabs a lesson they'll never forget - Duke Arthur - Yes? The queen asks you to stay away Send my apology to the queen and tell her that we're going to get revenge Richard's blood has not been shed in vain Tomorrow his flag will be hoisted over Jerusalem You are very brave I'm sure it was not an Arab hand that shot the arrow I know Arab could not commit such a crime As a Christian wife I thank you for doing your best to save my husband's life Let's hope his delirium doesn't last before dawn I was king of Jerusalem The sun... Richard! Your Majesty! You're better Sultan Saladin said you would get well - Saladin? - He came to your aid after we had lost all hope Saladin, always Saladin In consciousness, in sleep Even in illness he is here He's always confronting me I hoped we would have met at the gates... of the Church of Resurrection in Jerusalem I had expected that if It hadn't been for the plot against you Who was behind that plot? It has been proven that those nearest to you are the most likely to betray you I don't want your head but your hand stretched out in peace What peace, when you invite me to Jerusalem - and set a trap for me? - Richard... Your Majesty, offer a prayer for the deliverance of your husband You know that your accusations is false Why would we want to kill you? You're afraid to see me enter Jerusalem You shall visit it soon Soon I shall be King of Jerusalem Why must you be king of Jerusalem? Jerusalem is the birthplace of Christ Christianity is respected here, you know this Jerusalem belongs to the Arabs Stop this bloodshed That would satisfy God and Christ You forget that the Pope, - the woodsmen in the hills, - Richard as well as the peasants in the fields, the elderly gathered around their fire places, Richard! thousands of humble Christians eagerly await my return with the keys to Jerusalem You're running after an unattainable dream, You're not fighting for Christianity but for your own vanity You're seeking personal glory You're leading your men to their death in order to become king of Jerusalem You're looking for garlands You're driving thousands to their death on foreign soil in order to become king of Jerusalem The horns blow Richard, the Lion-Heart, liberator of Jerusalem You want war So be it But I warn you, you will never win Beware of yourself, noble knight Richard is alive! Richard is alive! No illness can defeat Richard! No poison can overcome Richard! Long live Richard! The Lion-Heart... is invincible! It's a miracle from Heaven We shall avenge you, Your Majesty O king of the Christians God has answered our prayers He has cured his son to lead us to Jerusalem We're all eager to attack them and hoist Richard's flag Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem is ours Lead us, Richard Forward, O warriors With the dawn, my flag will be flying over Jerusalem - Forward - This is your day, Damascene Are you sure this works? Yes, though I have never prepared it in such large quantities, only God knows... Careful! You'll blow us to high heaven So you are certain of the results Everything is ready Everything is ready, Your Majesty This is your day, Damascene Forward, heroes! Forward, brave men Forward, Crusaders! Jerusalem! Conquer Jerusalem! Long live King Richard! Attack without mercy Cling to every foot of land Nothing is more honorable than death beneath the walls of Jerusalem All of Europe awaits Your victorious return, warriors of the cross Let us take Jerusalem tonight! Make the supreme sacrifice Every step forward towards Jerusalem is worth dozens of martyrs - To battle! - To battle! Your Highness, hear me before you go every inch of the road to Jerusalem is covered with the remains of victims What do you mean? Raise the white flag before we are crushed by defeat Defeat? Richard knows not the meaning of defeat Europe does not ask that you return with the heads of innocents I shall return with the keys to Jerusalem and Saladin's head And now, sire? It's our turn to attack Open the gates! Attack! Forward! My god, I'm cold It's fever, friend, you'd better rest My wife, I want to go home You know the orders of the king, we must take Jerusalem tonight Tonight we'll die in Jerusalem Fool! Put out this fire! You think this fire gives us away? See that black mountain? Those are the hordes of Saladin's soldiers Tonight, this Christmas night... we meet death Lower your voice Everyone is fated to die A mountain of fire, a cloud of dust Don't burn me with the fires of the hell! I'm a sinner! Have faith. God will alleviate your pain Faith! The Lord spared the fornicator She was spared But He forgets Virginia May Christ be with you! I am no longer a beauty Help me, good Louisa Pray for me My sin has brought my doom "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name" "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven..." Enough! Enough! Praying will not change our fate The Arabs are coming from that hill, this Christmas eve, they'll spare no one Forgive me, I shall make a confession - To me? - Yes, you You are pure and chaste You are close to the Virgin's heart Conrad and I schemed against you We wanted to get rid of you and Richard God forgive me, but Conrad betrayed me He wanted to sell Jerusalem Jerusalem... grave of the prophets - Keep away from me! - Help me, Arthur The beautiful Virginia disfigured with fire! Leave her, Louisa Don't go, you're the only real Christian here, hear my confession It's no confession, she's delirious After Conrad had died, Arthur returned - with an Arab poisoned arrow... - Keep quite! Quite, Virginia, shut up! Louisa Arthur shot King Richard by an Arab poisoned arrow Quiet, Virginia Virginia! Virginia! Answer me We're the kings of Jerusalem Virginia! We're the kings of Jerusalem, Virginia Virginia! Virginia's dead, the poisoned arrow was Arthur's doing Louisa All your allies betrayed you, even Arthur All are treacherous The truce has expired - We are out of patience - Resume the offensive Tonight, we'll wipe them out We'll show them how it is to fight by night We'll teach them once and for all never to invade our land again We'll wipe them out Shall we give the signal for the attack? Merry Christmas Did you wish Issa and all our Christian brothers a merry Christmas? - Merry Christmas - Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Announce to all our Christian soldiers there'll be no war tonight - We'll wait till tomorrow - God is Great God is Great - Hasten to prayer - I bear witness... that there's no God but Allah I bear witness that there's no God but Allah And that Mohamed is His Messenger And that Mohamed is His Messenger Hasten to prayer Hasten to prayer Hasten to salvation Hasten to salvation God is Great There's no God but Allah Enough! The battlefield is covered with corpses This war has stopped making sense It is what you wanted, Richard It does not become a king with a lion's heart to go on fighting out of sheer obstinacy The Lion-Heart begs you to accept the hand he holds out On my way here, I saw thousands of corpses... littering the trail I could not tell the corpses of the Crusaders from those of the Arabs Before, I feared for Richard from Richard himself Today, I thank you for being the Richard I've always imagined I am only a vanquished king You could have waited for reinforcements What conditions does the triumphant sultan impose on the defeated king? No conditions But let us pledge not to fight any longer You'll leave this country but you'll always be welcomed back as pilgrims to the holy places The soldier who willingly gives his life is more worthy than his commander who seeks glory and personal gain He who forgets his pride is more worthy than all When you return to your country tell the peasants and the elderly, who eagerly await your return and tell of your conquests round their fireplaces in winter Tell the simple people of England... in their warm houses Tell the people of Europe upon your return that life is the right of all and that war cannot be the law of life Have they gone? - Have they gone yet? - Patience, my son What do you say? There they are, the sultan, Issa and Conrad Conrad died, you ignorant fool We hope to see you again in Jerusalem, as a pilgrim I'm the king of Jerusalem He ends his days in a cage like an animal Why don't you answer, Virginia? John, King of England, will punish Richard I am the king of Jerusalem! I will never forget your service to me, Louisa I hope to see you here again when I return as a pilgrim Issa... Issa Commander Issa, you're dismissed My thanks, O Lord. You've made your servant victorious By Your will alone, we have vanquished the enemy
