So you are at a disadvantage. Excuse me, I'll make the tea while you two, uh, get to know each other. - Do you need any help? - Oh, no, no. Thank you, my dear. Just sit down and get acquainted. It's a beautiful day. - Do you live in Los Angeles? - Yes. I was born back East, but we've lived here for about 12 years now. Uh. I've only ever been as far East as Vegas. [Mrs. Culnick] 'Tish is one of those rarities.' She was actually born in Los Angeles basin. Do you like Vegas? Never been there. Do you? Oh, yeah. I worked there for a couple of weeks. [Mrs. Wilcox] 'Oh, yes? Doing what?' In this sort of teenybopper topless joint until the boss found out my ID was faked. 'Mrs. Culnick didn't mention that, did she?' No. No, she didn't. Here we are. Would anyone like some rum in her tea? It's a lapsang souchong. Oh, Tish, darling, would you get the rum? 'It's on the other table.' Why didn't you tell Suzanne I worked in Vegas, Mrs. Culnick? I did this terrific number on a glass swing. Eight of us, right up over the audience. It was incredible. Thank you. What did you tell her? She told me that you went to UCLA and, you had your degree in English literature. [sighs] It was American literature and I went two semesters. You must really be into books if she told you I have a degree in English literature. My husband reads a lot. Well, there you are. - Heh, rum? - No, thank you. Can I get down to business and talk about what we came here to talk about? Tish.. ...this kind of thing has its own natural rhythm. 'I'm afraid you are disturbing the natural rhythm.' No. No, she's right. I was right. I thought your eyes were green. Now, to begin with my marriage is not in trouble. It's just the opposite. 'All our friends say that Jay and I' 'are the happiest couple they know.' Fantastic. Do you take drugs? What do you call drugs? [Mrs. Wilcox] 'LSD.' Just peyote. It's organic. The Indians live by it. Marijuana? Are you serious? Oh, but you could give it up? Yeah, if I had to. Sure. Of course she would. Good. I want you to meet my husband. Yeah, obviously. Now. Right now? Right now. [Tish] 'What does your husband do?' [Mrs. Wilcox] 'He's a management engineer.' [Tish] 'What's a management engineer?' [Mrs. Wilcox] Efficiency expert. What does that mean? That means he goes into business corporations and detects the excess fat, deadwood in production then he teaches them to reorganize for maximum efficiency. Hot damn! - Do you see him? - No. No, not yet. [Mrs. Wilcox] 'There he is. There's Jay.' Which one? That one. The handsome one, of course. Okay. [car starts] [clanking] He does read a lot. What? I was just looking at your record collection. You have lots of Frank Sinatra. Jay? Hello, darling. - Hi. - 'Tish.' [Mrs. Wilcox] I want you to meet my husband, Jay. Hello, Tish. How are you? I'm fine. I was just looking at your records. You have an awful lot of Frank Sinatra. We have all The Beatles, too. Would you like a drink? The bar is open. I'll have a Scotch and soda, darling. You are staying for dinner? Uh, I have to make a phone call. Oh, there's one on the table. And there's one in the kitchen. And there's one in the bedroom. [Jay] 'What would you like to drink?' Uh, do you have any wine? Red or white? White. [Jay] White. [male #1] 'Hello.' 'Is there any other way?' [male #2] 'It's good shit, man.' [telephone ringing] - Up isn't the way. - Up is the other way. Wanda, will you get that phone? [telephone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Billy? [Wanda over phone] 'No. It's Wanda.' - Oh, hi. - Tish? Hi. It's, uh.. Hey, where are you? I'm in Brentwood. Oh, me and Sam and a bunch of freaks we spent the afternoon at the bottom of the Pacific ocean floor. We brought you home some food. Well, we're waitin'. Are you coming? Uh, yeah, let me talk to Tad, okay? - Tad. - Yeah. Telephone. Oh, yeah. Hey, where are you? [Tish on phone] 'I'm in Brentwood.' 'Tad?' Hey, Tish, I'm in the kitchen and Wanda's moving at me with something and it's alive! Hey, you can cut it open and you put lemon on it and eat it. I don't know, it's just a sea porcupine. - Oh, come on. - It gets you high. Good. [slurping] - Mmm. - Like a malt. [Jay] 'Honey, do we only have two steaks?' No, no, sweetheart. There's another one in the freezer. What do you think? I think she's very attractive. Okay, I don't know what time I'll be home, okay? Well, she's been around. Of course she's been around, I mean what other kind of girl is going to agree to this kind of thing? Most kids today havebeen around. - How old is she? - She's 22. Oh, look. Here's the lighter fluid. I didn't forget it. [Tish] 'No, look, uh, I'm-I'm having dinner here.' 'No, ju-just save me one.' Yeah, save me some of that, too. Goodbye. Push it to the left. Wait, it-it may be locked. There you go. Did you ever try to walk right through it? Suzanne has, twice. What a bummer. Hey, do you want to ask me any questions? Ethnic background, stuff like that? Tell me about your boyfriend. Well, his name is Tad.. - Mm-hmm. - And he's beautiful. We've been living together about six months now. He makes fantastic things out of leather. Did you, did you see my coat and-and and purse on the couch? He made those. 'We're trying to get together a little shop.' 'Hey, maybe you could come down and give us some advice' 'on being more efficient.' Well, anyway, he's been busted three times. Twice in New York and once, once here. And he's tired of it. So he's like hiding out down there and trying to get his head together. Is that enough? Yeah. I think that's enough. He doesn't know about this. What's he going to say? We have a very open relationship. Uh, what happened to your glass of wine? I don't know. I-I, I don't drink much. I turn on. Norman Mailer says, "Booze is the active man's pot." Oh, yeah? Who's Norman Mailer? Oh, wow! It's a pretty pool. [Jay] 'We put it in ourselves.' Oh, it's nice. 'Would you like to go for a swim?' - Can I? - 'Yeah.' [Jay] 'I'll get you one of Suzanne's suits.' Oh, no. No, don't bother. Don't go through any trouble. I'm not bashful. 'Oh, my God! It's like a huge bathtub.' 'Oh!' [splashing] [Suzanne] 'Thank you, darlin'.' - Want some ice cream? - What kind? We have vanilla, chocolate burnt almond, and coffee. - Coffee. - I'll get it. Thank you. You see...at first.. ...we didn't wanna have any children. Jay was still in school and I was working. We couldn't afford them on any level. We wanted to be alone together and.. if we did have a child, we wanted to be able to give it everything. Then, January of the fifth year we changed our minds. It was our New Years' resolution. 'We were comfortable and we had a lovely house.' So we started trying. And we tried, and we tried, and we tried. We spent a fortune on doctors. 'Then, finally I was sent to a doctor in New York' 'that was about two years ago.' And he said yes, he thought there might be something wrong with me. And what was to have been an corrective and exploratory operation.. There were complications. 'I developed peritonitis' 'and to save my life, the doctor..' '...performed a hysterectomy.' It's a devastating thing to wake up to. Jay couldn't tell me, my mother had to. Can I have a doggie bag? I'm serious. This is my lunch for tomorrow. Alright. You ever thought of adopting a baby? 'Course. Thought of everything. But it isn't the same, is it, really? I want his child. I want a Jay Jr. Even if it isn't mine, it's a Jay Jr. [Jay] 'Here we are.' 'Coffee.' Thank you, darling. 'And chocolate syrup for those that will.' How many babies have you made for couples like us? How many did Mrs. Culnick tell you? No, no. I'm asking you. I've had one other baby. It was under different circumstances though and Mrs. Culnick found a wonderful home for him but this is the first time, you know, like this. And you could give it up, you could do that? Oh, yeah. I didn't want him. Yeah, I-I was too young, I didn't wanna be trapped. And have you ever seen him or made an attempt to see him? No. That-that was part of the bargain. Um, Suzanne and I.. ...obviously, have to discuss this whole thing very carefully. Yeah. well, I want to think about it, too. [Jay] Of course you do. If we do decide to go ahead there are...certain things we'd insist upon. Me, too. We mean certain rules, guarantees. You wanna be sure you're the father. I sure as hell do. Well, anyway you wanna work it out, you know whatever's most efficient. Um, lock me up.. ...chastity belts. But I just have one thing. After I'm pregnant and you're satisfied that you're the father I like, you know, live my own life and I see my own friends. And you live your life, you see your friends. And you know, we just don't get to know each other too well. I think it will be easier all the way around, you know? Mm-hmm. I can start anytime. If we do decide-- I have vacation starting the end of next week. Oh, wow, terrific. We could shoot for a Scorpio. [Tish] 'Is there anything else?' Yes. It has to be natural childbirth. Oh, I was knocked out during labor and delivery before. [Suzanne] 'This is much better for the baby.' What about me? You think about it. I'll give you some books on the subject. Yeah, I'll think about it. ♪ Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle balls ♪ Tad? Tad? [Tad humming] [laughing] Hey. Turn it off. Oh, hey, I saved you a sea urchin. Oh, no, thanks. Hey, you smell like chlorine and steak. You want some steak? Yeah. Wow. [Tad] 'Hey, I was in this whole water trip' you know, this water. I-I mean, like, it-it starts in a fresh spring, right? Far, far away. And then it gets jammed 'through thousands and thousands' 'and thousands of miles of man-laid pipe.' [Tad laughs] Oh, wow. Chemicals. Yeah, see.. ...they come out the other end through faucets. 'And that fresh spring is as dry as a bone.' 'Hey, this is good steak.' 'H-hey, who you been with that can afford a good steak, huh?' Oh, wow! Hey, maybe, maybe this cow drank from that spring. [instrumental music] [Tad exhales deeply] D-did I just ask you if you were going away and did you just say this may be the last time for a while? Yes. I can't remember saying any of that.

Then why don't we start-- Not with you. What? Not with you. R-remember when I told you about Mrs. Culnick? You know, th-that lady I met through Charlotte. She was really nice and she helped me out before w-when Charlie stood for-- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, she asked me if I'd be interested in something almost a year ago, and she phoned me this morning and I, and I went out and I met this couple. What couple? Well, their names are Jay and Suzanne and they can't have any children 'cause she's had a hysterectomy and they want to have a baby that's at least half theirs. And they're thinking about it, and I'm thinking about it. But I-I told Mrs. Culnick I'd only do it, you know if I really liked the couple and they really liked me. And they're gonna give me $500 down. Wow. Far out. Hey, beautiful. Beautiful. "$500 down in cash "all expenses starting today. "Rent, food, et cetera. "But not to exceed $150 a month. '"$500 upon affirmation of pregnancy.' '"Maternity wardrobe, doctor, and hospital bills' and at birth, $2,000 in cash." An extra 100 if it's a boy. Okay. [Mrs. Culnick] '"One...hundred' 'extra if child is male."' [typewriter bell dings] "Uh, Wilcox agree to pay "Culnick fee of $500. "Half now, half on delivery.

Mmh, chocolate-covered marshmallow chocolate-covered pecan.. You know bonbons are my favorites. Oh! There's a beauty. A beauty, a beauty. Mmm! Good. Last night on the news there was a young boy who'd been wounded in the war. He looked just like your father. Part of his head shot off. They asked him if he wasn't grateful to think the doctors have been able to save his life. Well, he looked at them as though they were crazy and he said "Yes, he was grateful." [gasps] There's Myrna Loy. Well, I can't let her see me looking like this. Hmm. [chuckles] Come on. Hey, wait. I-I don't know when I'll be home again, but uh.. ...you can always reach me at Tad's. I'm not gonna ask where you got that money. Good. You'd lie to me anyway, wouldn't you? That's right. Hey, but save a 100 for yourself and, uh, treat grandma to the races. And put the rest in the bank. - Okay, baby. Anything you say. - Okay. Come on, I'll drop you at the restaurant. You could hitchhike home from there. Oh! [engine rumbling] Oh, it's terrific. It's beautiful. Jay, darling, you better bring in some extra wood before it gets dark. I'll get it later, honey. Oh, and I brought some sugar 'and some vanilla extract and whipping cream' in case we get a fresh snow. We can have snow ice cream. Tish? - 'Tish?' - Yes, ma'am? Would you please take the rock salt and sprinkle it on the steps before one of us breaks their neck? - Sure. - Thank you. We can still change our mind. Shh. I'm gonna leave now, alright? You know where I'll be if you need me. In the motel, A8. [Suzanne] Oh, Tish, I'll be back in the morning about 10:30 or 11:00 to fix us all breakfast. - 'Is that too early?' - Not for me. Look.. ...this is absolutely ridiculous. You don't have to wear it if you don't want to, Tish.. ...but it would mean a great deal to me. Hey, it's okay with me. Thank you. - I'll walk you to the car. - No. I'm fine. I'm walking you to the car, so just shut up. Don't go away. [Jay] 'Tish?' Hey, do you want a drink? I'm having a drink. Oh, no, I don't think so. Sure? Hey, I-I don't suppose Suzanne would approve if I smoked. I thought you didn't smoke. Some grass. No, no, I don't think Suzanne would approve if you smoked some grass. Okay, I'll have a drink then. Alright. What's that? It's a thermometer. Is that something new? Does that make you high or something? I'm checking my temperature. See, physiologically, it's perfect. You run, you run a low temperature. And we're in the right part of my cycle so, if we do it an hour before ovulation there's a better chance it'll be a boy. Now, wait a minute now. We're not in a clinic here. Now this whole thing is being a little too clinical for my part. Well, your wife figured it all out for me. Oh. [instrumental music] [music continues] [fire crackling] Beautiful. You really love her, don't you? Very much. And you don't go to bed with other girls? Mm-mm. That's fantastic. I can tell by the way you two treat each other. I-I get the feeling that she, like, sometimes, like.. ...thinks you do, and-and-and she gets jealous and all that shit. And you have to say, "No, man, I didn't ball that chick." - Right? Right. - Yeah. Does that make me square? Being faithful make me square? I think it's beautiful. I don't understand it.. ...but I don't understand a lot of beautiful things. Like, I don't understand people who can make music. I envy that. I-I think they're beautiful. You two must be very sexually happy. Very. You're lucky. That's not luck, that's hard work. I don't understand you. I really don't. Well, that's okay. I like that, you know? It's.. That's nice. Like, you never once asked me why I was doing this. - Not once. - Mm. I was waiting for you to ask me, you know? I-I was, I was into all the answers. - For the money.. - Mm-hm. Look, it's-it's, it's creative, isn't it? I mean, what is it, you know? It's.. No waste of time. It's an easy way to make a living. And every mother in America earns her living that way. Why shouldn't I? Oh, did you.. Did you ever read Shaw on the subject? Who? George Bernard Shaw. Who's George Bernard Shaw? [Tish laughs] He said...that marriage and motherhood.. ...was the greatest slavery invented by man. My mother told me that. My mother.. My mother is not a stupid woman. My mother thinks like Shaw. You see.. I discovered that I.. I really just love being pregnant. [chuckles] I love it. I love everything about it. But I-I don't want any kids. You know, I like kids, but uh.. I don't-I don't want the responsibility of raising somebody in the world the way it is you know, the-the way it is? Mm-hm. And I'm not doing it for the money just for the money. It's like... proof of the reality of my own existence. Oh, wow. What a rap. You're a terrible disadvantage. Why's that? You're very beautiful. Oh, your wife, you know explained a lot of things about you. Oh, for Christ's sakes. Oh, no, no, no. It's beautiful. It's...it's lovely. She loves you. In the beginning, love is so important. I want to make.. ...the first moment of life so beautiful. Like creation. Like this is gonna be a terrific kid. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [music continues] - Good morning. - Good morning.

"...Oh, opelero, let a child come." "Oh, opelero, let a child come." Yes. And then the woman pretends to nurse the baby.. The doll. Then the man holds the chicken by its feet over the husband's head and mumbles something. Then they sacrifice the chicken.

Too many people. - You know? - That's true. [chuckles] I don't want to live where people can be, like, an inconvenience, you know. Yeah. I know what you mean. New York city, man, everybody's on everybody else's ass. Well.. [instrumental music] [Suzanne] "Third month. The baby's tail begins to diminish in size. "By the end of the month, it disappears. "The webbing between the fingers and toes "also disappears. "Very thin fingernails and toenails appear. "And the buds that will grow into baby teeth are forming in the gums."

Good! - Come on! [female #3] 'Come on, Tish!' [indistinct chatter] [chuckles] What is it? What's the matter? Look. Oh, my God. [instrumental music] Hi. - Where is she? - They took her right away. She's down there some place. - You want to sit down? - No. Thank you. Is she in pain? - No. - Well, h-h-how did it happen? - It wasn't my fault. - I'm not accusing you. - Just horsing around. - Yeah, but what were you doing? Playing volleyball on the beach, like I told you on the phone. Well, you didn't tell me you were playing volley-- - Yeah, volleyball. - Tad, if she loses this baby.. You'll just have to try again. - What is it? - I'm alright. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. - 'Mrs. McCain.' - The baby? The baby's fine. He said that 20 percent of all women spot during pregnancy. My uterus hasn't risen from the hollow of my lower spine. It's not serious, but it has to come forward. 'So he, uh, put in a ring and he gave me some instruction' on a thing called knee-chest position. Come on, let's get out of here. I'm gonna stay and talk with Dr. Sims. Y-your baby's fine, really. I believe you. I just want to talk with Dr. Sims. You two go on. Well, that's what I'd do, George. Well, that's quite alright, we're just spending a quiet Sunday around the pool. No, we are not being antisocial. We'd love to sometime. 'Well, look, uh, why don't you and I' 'meet at the courts next Saturday' at, uh...10 o'clock? Alright. Tish! Time for the knee-chest position. Okay! [instrumental music] [Suzanne] "Fourth month. The baby's growing rapidly. "By the end of this month "it will be four to six inches long "and weigh approximately four ounces. "It now looks like a baby, completely formed "but with a great deal of growing still to do. "At this stage, the baby could be cupped in the palm of a hand." [drumming] [Tad] Get on, get on down! Hey, hey, hey! ♪ Pa ra pum pum pow! ♪ ♪ Ba bee ba bah bah bah ♪ [Tish] Tad! Yeah? How much longer does this have to go on? Well, it doesn't have to go on for a full nine months. Why don't you go in the other room, huh? I can't. I have ten more minutes. Sure is attractive. [Tish] 'Yeah? Well, you're really terrific.' Yeah, I'm learning. I'm learning. Just like you learned to play the guitar? I'm sorry. You play good guitar. [telephone rings] - Yeah? - 'Hello, Tad.' Yeah, just a minute. It's the wife of the father of your child. I'm in the position. [Suzanne on phone] 'I'm not checking up on you.' 'I just called to tell you that Jay got us some seats' 'for the ballet on Sunday night.' 'I thought you'd enjoy it.' Look, I'll talk to you later. We're having a fight. Goodbye. Oh, come on, Tad! Come on. Come on! [door slams] [sighs] He never stayed out all night before without calling me or something. [engine rumbling] [exhales heavily] Brick floors are a bitch to keep cleaning. Yeah, well, I guess I haven't felt like doing much housework lately. Morning. I, uh.. I fell asleep on Harvey's couch. - You do all this? - 'Mm-hm.' - Great. - Thank you. How much longer have I got to go? Another five minutes. Hey, I fell asleep on Harvey's couch. Okay. [water running] I'm taking a bath because I fell asleep Harvey's couch. Harvey has dogs and Harvey's couch is dirty. Tad, you left her here all alone all night. She-she's a big girl. She can take care of herself. You'll be surprised. She's in a delicate condition. Harvey's couch is also uncomfortable. I understand, Tad, that this must be difficult for you but Jay and I would appreciate it if you'd be a bit more considerate. Considerate? I-I mean, you could help her more There's absolutely no reason for that many dirty dishes. - You could be nicer. - I made cream of wheat for her. Three nights in a row. What do you want? - You have an obligation-- - I have a headache. And we're paying the rent here. That doesn't obligate me. Don't give me that obligation shit. I don't have an obligation to anybody but myself, right? Now don't hand me any of your lame middle-class obligation crap, it's not my kid. Tish, why don't you come over to the house for the rest of the day? We'll fix a nice supper and go see a movie. 'You're welcome to come, too, Tad.' No, thanks. I wanna work on my bike. Tish? No. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for cleaning up the place. She even did the laundry. I fell asleep on Harvey's couch. You know, she was just trying to be nice, Tad. What do you want me to do, kiss her ass? I didn't ask her to come in here and clean up my shop. As a matter of fact, it's too goddamn.. [pots crashing] That's better. Now I recognize it. I didn't recognize it was so clean before. Home sweet home. [alarm ringing] [phone rings] - Hello. - Hey, it moved. It moved for the first time. - It moved. - Let me speak to her. Here's Suzanne. That's fantastic. Oh, God! It moved? When, just now? [chuckles] If felt just like the fluttering of a pair of pants! [muttering] [Suzanne] "Fifth month, it is during this month "that the baby begins to be active "and is now growing large enough to make a noticeable bulge in the abdomen." How is the leather shop coming along? It's getting there. Now that Tish is five months pregnant and determined to stay down there I.. ...was wondering whether you two need any more money. I realize a $150 a month is not a very realistic figure for two people to live on. Three. Three people. Yeah, three people. I don't want Tish doing any lifting or any heavy housework. I don't like the idea of my wife going down there to do it either. I wanna hire a good cleaning service to come in once or twice a week and straighten the place up. Did, uh... Tish put you up to this? Absolutely not. Look, I want you to be nicer to her. You know, there's a lion in the Central Park Zoo.. ...who's been there for so many years and has had so little room to move around in that he's lost all the strength in his legs. [engine revving] [Tad] 'Hey, Tish!' 'Tish, come on. Let's go, huh?' 'Tish!' It takes a little time. My ankles are swollen. [Tad] 'Hey, look. Maybe you ought to stay here.' I don't want to stay here, but.. It's.. I'm not an invalid. It isn't a disease. Come on. We're late. Hey, be nice! Iamnice. Be nicer. Okay, I'm on! [instrumental music] [Suzanne] Sixth month.

[clears throat] Shall we? Take good care of her. [instrumental music] [Suzanne] Seventh month. The internal organs of the baby are nearing their full development. And in some cases, are now capable of functioning outside the mother. [Tish] Do you have any pictures of Jay when he was a baby? I think so. Oh, of course, I do. I'll have to look for them. And this is the famous baby picture. [laughs] Oh, wow! 'I'd know him anywhere. He hasn't changed.' He hasn't changed at all. Oh, look at him! He's so beautiful. I bet the baby's gonna look just like him, just like.. 'Just like his daddy.' See, baby? See your daddy? Tish? - What's the matter? - What is it? L-let me in. I can't sleep. Move over, honey. I was lonely. I don't want to be alone. - God, your feet are cold. - Mm, you're so warm. [Suzanne] Eighth month. The embryo is now a mature infant measuring some 19 inches and weighing around 6 pounds. [female #4] 'Now, we'll review the lamaze breathing' 'and expulsion techniques' 'and especially work on the transition pant-blow pattern' 'or the blow-blow-blow pattern' 'which counteracts the urge to push.' 'The fathers who will be going into the delivery room' 'will learn what to do to coach the mother' 'during the birth of the baby.' 'Now let's go into the deep chest breathing.' 'Contraction begins.' 'Take a deep, cleansing breath.' - Beautiful! - Ooh! Iron, calcium, B, C, potassium. Iron, calcium, B, C, potassium. Iron, calcium.. ...B, C.. Potassium! Here, baby. Iron, calcium, B, C, potassium! I feel wonderful! I love you. Repeat after me, "I love you, too." I love you, too. The father should love the mother of his child. I'll be glad when I get my body back and be able to go swimming again. It's all your fault. Ooh! Guilty. Guilty. How would you like him to be? I called Charlotte and she said that there are basically two distinct classes of Scorpio people. Materialists and mystics. You, materialist. What would you like for him to be? - A mystic. - A mystic? I'd like him to be someone who'd change the world. I love you. You know, solve some serious problems. You know, I think that'd be terrific. You're not repeating after me. Who's Charlotte? I love you. [Tish] 'I lived with charlotte before I met Tad.' She's my best friend. She's a political animal in my life. You want to meet her? Yeah, okay. You have to promise to wear your jacket. My jacket? [male #1] Well, this is the place. Yeah. We love it. We.. Um.. Um, shall I, uh, show you people down here? You know, let them go and do their thing and.. Patio. [Dexter] Oh, wow. Ha-ha-ha! Okay, I'll just, uh, sit here and you people can do whatever you want. - Okay, thank you.. - You need anything, I'm here. - I feel like a fool. - You look like a fool. Hmm. Garbage disposal. Wall-to-wall carpeting. Swimming pool. Oh, a roll around his middle. No. That he doesn't have. Well, he's-he's not bad-looking.. ...for one of the enemy. Jay is not the enemy. Oh, yes, honey. Thatis the enemy. She has her hair done once a week. The same time, the same place, the same queen. She's not there yet, but she is working her way toward the day of blue hair. 'I have a theory..' ...that all the commercial dye American women put on their head seeps through the scalp and affects the brain. Particularly that part that votes. [Jay] 'That's what you said.' [Charlotte] 'That isnot what I said.' [Jay] 'That is what you said.' That's what you said. [Charlotte] 'Shut up, Dexter!' Alright. Alright. Why don't you try again? What I meant was that a kid raised by a middle-aged, suburban couple-- She's talking about us, honey. A middle-aged, suburban couple. Right. Is like sending it through a whole useless thing. What thing? I don't know what you're talking about. If Tish were to change her mind and raise it herself.. What thing? Why do you want to plant a kid in this world, anyway, man? I mean, with thermonuclear warfare and cities looking like ant hills and-- [Charlotte] 'Thank you, Dexter.' If she were to change her mind and raise the kid herself she would be raising it in the right order of the universe. You raise it an unnatural generation behind. Uh, she's talking about revolution, man. I am talking about the future. I am talking about the future of your baby. You're gonna impress all of your false values on it. And she would allow it to learn for itself. It maybe that the hope of the future has to be raised in a comfortable, middle-class home All that shame and false values around it to see through the sham and false values. How do we know that this kid here, this kid in here.. ...after Suzanne and I screw it up, which is your point won't grow up to be somebody to change the world? How do we know that this kid here.. Come on, partner. Raised by you.. ...won't grow up to, uh.. ...be the Governor of California or the Vice President of the United States? [laughing] Brilliant. Bastard. Are you alright? Oh, sure, I had to lay down for a few seconds. Do you want me to rub your back? They're good people, you know? They have a nice life. That's not life. Have you seen Tad lately? No. Have you? Mm-hmm. I ran into him at Papa Box last Friday night. Who was he with? [Charlotte] He was alone. You should call him, you know. Yeah, I know. You're going to have to have someplace to go when this is all over. Yeah. I know. Thanks. We enjoyed it. Me, too. Tish, don't let them, uh, forget to come Saturday. Yeah, man, come by.

[heart beating] [male #2] 'There it is, the sound of a heartbeat, loud and clear.' [Tish] 'Hey, diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle.' [Tish and Jay] 'The cow jumped over the moon.' The little dog laughed to see such a sport and the dish [Jay and Tish] Ran away with the spoon. [Jay] 'You know what Sir Henry Reed said about that?' "I prefer to think" he said, "That this rhyme "commemorates the athletic lunacy "to which the strange conspiracy of the cat and the fiddle incited the cow." Darling, I just thought of another name. Walter. My grandfather's middle name was Walter. 'Walter Jay Wilcox?' I still like William Jay the best. William Jay Wilcox. William Jay Wilcox. You know, I've been thinking about nursing the baby myself. 'I-It'd be better for the baby.' I mean, he'd never be allergic to his own mother's milk. Human's milk is for humans. Cow's milk is more DDT. - 'I want to.' - No. No, Tish. Absolutely not. Now we agreed on that. I must establish my relationship with the baby as soon as possible. No. [rain pattering] [instrumental music] [automated message] This is a recording. You have reached a disconnected number. Please be sure you have the right number. I-I'm going out for a while. See you later. - Where you going? - Out. Isn't it alright? Tish, it's late and it's raining. Don't do a parent number on me, Suzanne, please. You can do a parent number on him when he's born. But not on me right now, I'm not a prisoner here-- [Jay] 'Okay, Tish, that's enough.' I wouldn't go out if I were you. Well, you're not me, are you? Here. Take the station wagon. I'm sorry. It's alright. Sometimes I do forget who's having the baby. [engine sputtering] [instrumental music] [car door clanks] [music continues] [music continues] What the fuck? - Oh, God! - She's a good girl. [crying] [laughing] [engine sputtering] [juicer whirring] [toaster clanking] [Jay] 'What are you doing?' What does it look like? 'I, ah..' I just woke up this morning, you know.. I had a flash that I had to make you breakfast. I, I started even before the sun came up. Look at the biscuits, see. I know how a dog feels when, when they start tearing up paper. I think we're about to have a birthday. You've had a contraction? - I better get Suzanne. - No, no, wait, please. Sit down. I wanna make you breakfast. [Jay] 'Oh, my God!' Alright. [instrumental music] Mmm.. That's the best orange juice I've ever tasted. Yeah, I-I put the pulp in it too. Uh, Suzanne doesn't but I do. It's better, much better. Yeah. I know. The biscuits aren't quite done. 'Coffee. Right.' Now don't look at me. I'm all blotched and purple and ugly. You are absolutely beautiful. I don't know. It was so different before. It was so easy. 'There was no father before.' [sighs] Oh, you can't drink this coffee. It's terrible. Are you sure you don't want me to go get Suzanne? You know, I get confused, you know.. And jealous.. And possessive, you know. I hate feeling like that. I hate it. I don't know. I-I never wanted, you know, any security before. I didn't want it but it's her security. It's not mine. Security just.. But it's our baby, it's not her baby, you know. She may, she may think it is, but it's.. [oven timer buzzing] I followed the recipe. She's had a contraction. Tish! [Jay] 'I'll call Dr. Sims.' Tish, when did it happen? How long ago? Oh, come on, Suzanne. Please, leave me alone, huh? No, of course, I'm not gonna leave you alone. - Hey, please. - Darling, I know how you feel. Oh, come on. You don't know how I feel. No, I suppose I don't. Oh, Tish, we love you. We love you so much. Great. [Jay] 'I called Dr. Sims. He's on his way over there right away.' [Suzanne] 'Oh, Good. I put Tish's bag by the front door.' 'It won't take me a second to get dressed.' - 'How is she?' - 'Well, she, she's fine.' - 'She's fine.' - 'Ah..' 'Where are your shoes?' [Jay] 'Where's my corduroy raincoat?' [Suzanne] 'Corduroy raincoat. Oh, I sent it to the cleaners.' 'You don't need your Corduroy raincoat, darling.' - 'Where're your shoes?' - 'Where are my shoes?' [Suzanne] 'Uh, uh, they're in the closet, sweetheart.' 'On the left-hand side next to black ones.' [indistinct chatter] [Jay] 'I'll get the car ready. Okay?' - 'Hurry up.' - 'Yes, I'm gonna be a second. [clock ticking] Okay, Tish. It's time to get on the table now. That's it. [exhales] Okay. Relax the forehead now. Relax your forehead. Focus.

I hope that the baby comes soon. [Suzanne] It's alright. Until the doctor tells us we're not going to push, alright? You don't push until he tells us. [inhales deeply] Now remember to focus.

Relax your forehead. Focus. Blow. 'Blow, blow.' [Tish breathing heavily] - Relax your forehead. - Breathe. Keep your focus. Well, when do you think I can push? - Doctor, when can she push? - 'With the next contraction.' You can push with the next contraction. Now, remember, quick breathing bursts-- It's coming. [inhales deeply] One...two. Now, deep breath and hold it. Up. - That's it. Elbows up. - 'One, two, three, four.'

[Dr. Sims] 'The head's clearing.' I'm suctioning out the nose and mouth now. 'The head's rotating.' [breathing heavily] 'A little push through the shoulders, just a little one.' Push now. Push now. [Dr. Sims] 'Good. Here come the shoulders.' 'Relax now. No more pushing.' 'Here comes the baby.' [laughs] - 'It's a boy.' - Oh! [Jay] Tish, it's a boy. Bless you. [laughing] [baby crying] [Mrs. Culnick] 'Isn't he adorable?' 'Six pounds and nine ounces. Imagine.' Oh, look, look. He's smiling. [Suzanne] 'Oh, no, he's not smiling. He's not old enough yet' Yes, youaresmiling. Hey, can we get down to business? Oh, yes. Two thousand dollars in cash. And, uh, extra 100 'cause it's a boy. I'd like to, I'd like to buy him something. I think he ought to have at least one Dylan album. I'll make sure he gets them all. Well, we should be going. Oh, I was just going to offer you all a drink. [baby cries] No, we-we should go. Hey, uh.. Have you ever thought of moving out of.. You know the smog and city? I'd bet he'd really love to grow up on a farm with real horses and fresh springs and stuff. You have a very beautiful son, Mrs. Wilcox. Thank you. I hope he has a wonderful life. We'll try. Not too hard. [baby crying] Mrs. Culnick, will you walk me the funicular, please. Why, of course. We'll keep in touch, alright? No. Uh-uh. No, if we run into each other.. ...on the street or in a movie somewhere we just nod, okay? Okay. Don't you worry about her.
