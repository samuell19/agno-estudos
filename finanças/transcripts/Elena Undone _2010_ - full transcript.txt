ELENA UNDONE (2010) In love, one and one... are... one. Seldom do we get the opportunity to witness the art in love. But that is what we all really desire. Not just to be loved, but to be loved in that all-encompassing, Heathcliffe-on-the-moors, one-true-Iove, soulmate kind of way. And yet, rarely are we prepared for it when it happens by. Perhaps you've been trying to inject meaning into your life... endlessly seeking that spiritual connection in other ways. There's no way I'm going. That's no way to behave, young man. Nash, you did hear that they're protesting downtown? The nerve of those people. Nerve is right. It's all a lot of noise. Noise and nonsense... but we'll be there. All of us, Pastor Barry. Don't you worry. That's the kind of support we're looking for, right? Or maybe you're one of those rare and fortunate few who find true love very early in life. For others, life might be at its most grim. This way, Peyton... you can arrange your life exactly as you want it... And precisely as you like. You did an amazing job today, Lombard. Thank you. And as funerals go, not too shabby. Yeah. I think Mom even would have approved. You know, if we had a few more years, we could have made her a Democrat. Maybe not. It's really pretty, isn't it? I need to go for a swim. Well, do it. And if soulmates exist, how can we be sure that that person we meet or the person that we're sharing our life with is the one? Here are a few stories that may shed some light on the subject. I'll let you be the judge. Our families... they kept us apart for ten years. We lost track. Then, one day, I was in the airport, on my way to London for school. I saw the back of Rasheed's head, from across an entire airport. I knew it was him. I turned as if I had no control over my body. I turned, and I saw him. I saw him, this man - this beautiful man, who I love. This man that I love. That is what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about! The twin flame. The ultimate love connection. You know, I heard that someone might be ovulating this morning. Mmm, hmm. It wouldn't happen to be you, would it? It would. Then I'll be right back. OK. I love you. I know. There are no guarantees in life, Peyton. Be prepared for anything. So, what time will you meet us? Uh... not sure. Don't tell me you're not coming. Millie, I really have a lot to do. I'm very busy. Oh, it's very clear God's got your back. You're running everything here so smoothly. But you have to commit to your faith... and put it to real work. Well, you know I teach the kinder program on Saturday mornings, but I really just don't think that your interpretations... Please. Interpretations? That's the oldest trick in the book. But given that the Bible was written in... They are tearing us apart with all their marriage talk and liberal judges ruling willy nilly in their favor. We are not going to stand by and allow it, Mrs. Winters. Shame on you. Shame on you for undermining your husband's work. But more importantly - God's work. Elena... I'm sorry, but she just... she's been really tired. It's OK. I've already forgiven her. I knew you would. So excuse me. Oh, sure. # And how do we mend this whole world # # And mold it into something better # # Only love and only time # # Will ease my mind # # I'm looking for something better # Why do people drink tea? It's a very civilized way to pass the time. I drink tea, Peyton, because there's nothing that a good cup of tea can't fix. I'm so sorry. - Did you start your period? - Yeah. I know how much you want this. But maybe we're trying to hard. Or maybe we should ask God, pray to God to bring us another child. Millie. Hey, sweetie, it's Aunt Lenore. Um, the family's a bit concerned. No one's heard from you in days. We know you like your privacy, but the nursing home called, and you know, your mom would be pretty horrified if she knew you hadn't gone to pick up her belongings yet. # And how do we mend this whole world # # And mold it into something better # # Only love and only time... # Now then... For those of your debating the soulemetry qualities of that special someone, let us look at a few of the criteria that are absolutely necessary if this person is indeed your twin flame. First of all, this person may come in an unusual package. Not your typical type. I was a nun for years, and I was working at the food bank when she came in, looking like the bad side of awful. And so I got her into treatment and found her a welding job, you know, got her back on her feet. And somewhere during all of that, I fell deeply in love with her. But it was, it was against everything that I believed in. So I prayed and went into seclusion, but nothing, nothing that I did could, um, keep her from my mind. And, um, then one morning, I woke up in the hospital. God, I was scared. You were pale. Apparently, I had passed out from dehydration, and when I came to, there was Jackie... sitting there like an angel. I thought I'd never see her again. When I did... And I knew from that moment, even though my entire life had been devoted to the church and Catholic scripture, I knew that my God loved Jackie... And loved me loving her. You're gonna love this one. It's called "Soulemetry By The Stars." My beautiful wife Lily arranged the whole thing. See ya' there. Ah! As if on-cue. Hey, baby. I'm about to go snap up that internet company that's been cut off at its knees. Ah! If they only knew what a pussy cat you really are. I mean, seriously. Do I look like I belong with this jet-setting businesswoman? Or any woman for that matter? All my life, everybody thought I was gay. Was it my sensitivity? My extensive collection of Barbara Streisand memorabilia? Who can say. When it comes to Lily, it's the real deal. He's all yours. You are going to love this story! Or not. Let's get you a drink. You're not doing anything wrong. Stop that! Maybe it's a sign. Well, that's why we're adopting. Listen, my exquisite angel... I know you better than anybody. My God, between your archaic parents and Barry's crusades du jour, it's a testament to your strength... Or complete insanity. Tell me something. What's in this for you? Come on, give me your hands. Give me your hands. If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, he is not your twin flame. Alright? This silly little congregation. Oh... Interesting. What? I'm getting that you should pursue the adoption. Someone is definitely coming into your life... - In a big way. - Yes. A baby. - That's not what I'm seeing. - Please... I love that you do all of this. You know I do. I just, I'm not sure that I believe what... Sweetheart, there is no denying what I'm seeing here. Your destiny is gonna happen whether you like it or not. - I know what I'm talking about. - I know you do. Secondly, they meet. Randomly. Possibly, the only place their worlds could intersect. Sorry, I just had a quick question. I can't help but notice that I'm the only single person here, and I, I just wanted to know, um, I mean, I have a job as a writer, I just, I didn't know if there was a longer process... No, it's just as long, whether you're single or married. And all the paperwork's right in here for you. OK. Thank you. Are you... Are these yours? Oh! Thank you! I'm sorry. I'm so silly. It happens to me all the time. I just forgot my bag! I don't mean to pry, but are you OK? Oh, yes. I'm just, I am... It's all just a little bit overwhelming. Yeah. I know. I, uh, heard you talking. Um, why do you want to do this alone? Uh, well, it hadn't really been the plan - but you know what? It's a long story. Right. You're the writer. That's funny. What about you? What do you do? I'm a photographer, actually. Well, I used to be a photographer. I better be going. OK. Do you have a card? I'm always looking for photographers. I do. Me too, somewhere. It's, um, well, it's kind of old. It's great. It works! - Thank you. - Sure. You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, it's me! Where are you? In the kitchen. Thank God you live across the street. I am so stuck in a loop here. Whoa... Geez-o. Help a sister out, will you? Well, here we go! For medicinal purposes - isn't that what you need? Is there a cricket in the house? Yeah. That's going to drive me freaking mad. Oh, great. OK, shoo shoo the cricket. Yeah, I just feel so out of control. I mean, you'd think I'd be able to beat it. I wrote the damn book on it. Oh, come on. That was before your mom's death. Not to mention psycho-chick cheating on you with my girlfriend! It wasn't all her fault. You know, I was completely MIA once my mom got sick. Yeah, you're way too forgiving. Honestly, I don't know why you wanted to procreate with her anyway. I mean, you have seen "Rosemary's Baby." You know, at least with Margaret, we were compatible. Yeah. Lombard! I've know you since high school, and you were with her because she was safe! There was about as much passion between you and Devil Woman as a bloody rice cracker! I mean, they're very nice. But I don't want one in my vagina, and I'm absolutely sure that you don't either! Oh, my God. And I know I'm different. You know? I go through 'em like socks in a drawer, but at least I get to feel. I get highs, lows, schmucky... And all good and fucky! So you are going to have to put your wonderful heart out there and get to feel all these wonderful feelings, too. But until that time, you are under strict orders to only do things that make you feel good. Not bad. Good. OK. Don't ever let them see your pain, Peyton. Don't let your guard down, ever. Look, Lombard. This love guru is supposed to be the absolute best. OK, Wave. Anything to get out of this house. Remember that chick I was seeing on Friday? Mmm, hmm. She was dating Erin and my ex. I don't even want to hear it. You said your eyes were wide open. Yeah, well? I'm legally blind in my left eye, so thank you very much for your sensitivity. You know what you're like? You're like the lesbian Jennifer Aniston. Why in the hell do you think we're going to this thing? Where are you going all dolled up? You know I'm going to Tyler's event. Oh, yeah, that's right. You know, I still don't get it. He was on his way to being one of the best directors in film school, and now he's messin' around with his soul foods? - Soulemetry. - Soulemetry? - Yeah. - Mmm, hmm. Yeah... I don't get it. He lives for this. And I live for... this. You know, maybe you could wear this next date night. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, maybe if you get lucky, I'll get home early. - Yeah? - Yeah. See ya later. The cookie... Look, Lombard, this love guru is supposed to be the absolute best. Tell me why I have to go to this thing again. Because if I do find my soulmate, you must approve! And I figured we'd find you one while we're at it. # Love! # # One and one are One # # The heart of love # # Reveals the beauty of our soul # How many times do our eyes simply not see? Your soulmate could be standing right next to you right now, and you wouldn't even know it. That's because you have your true self, and what I call your celebrity self. The one that's obsessed with ego, the one that wants the hunk or the thick brown hair, the bedroom eyes. Ah, you know what I'm talking about, don't you? You know, you recognize, you really recognize. These pairings never work out. And when they fail, we wonder why, why, why, with our broken hearts and our bruised egos. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying physical attraction isn't important. Of course, it is. Hello! What I am saying is don't confuse the attraction to the physical with the yearning of the soul. Given its chance, the true self, the higher self will always break through to find its soul partner. And trust me, it could come from the person you least expect it. Chew on that... and some hors d'oeuvres. I'm going to start my readings in a few minutes. Welcome, welcome. That woman over there? No, no, don't look. She's trying to hit on me. Seriously! Oh, my God, she is not coming over here. Uh, excuse me... Pardon me. - Hey. - Hey. There you are. Oh, my God. Could she be any more stunning? - You were great. - Thank you. I am Tyler Montegue, and you are... Peyton. I actually met Peyton at the adoption center. Small world. Small world. Six degrees. What's that even mean? This delusion with accidents. I'm going to start my readings. Well, since this was obviously pre-ordained, do you wanna get a drink? - I would love to. - OK. I feel like I'm at the races, always picking the wrong horse. That's just it. Has it ever occurred to let love find you? Peyton, you're so brave... To want to have a baby on your own. You never thought about getting married? Oh, I was married. I thought you said you were single. I am - now. - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's OK. How long were you married? Six years. You? Fifteen. What happened? I don't know. I guess all the predictable stuff. My partner couldn't handle all the time I spent with my ailing mother. Your partner? Mm hmm. Your partner... You're, um... Gay. Well, I think that that is just fine. I voted no on Prop 8. Or was it yes on Prop 8? I don't know, it was all very, very confusing, but I know that I voted the right way. I mean, I voted your way. I just, I don't want you to think that it's a problem for me because it's really not. I mean, why would it be? Oh, God, I'm sounding pretty ridiculous! You're fine. Well, apparently, I am inspiration for looking for love in all the wrong places. Well, it looks like this was a bust for me, - but, um, you two... - Wave. This is Elena Winters. Pleased to meet you. I really have to run. My husband has early services tomorrow. Barry's a pastor. Oh! Hmm, that, uh... Cool! It was nice running into you again. Pleased to meet you, Wave. I will see you, Peyton. You fancy her... And she fancies you. Don't even talk to me. Did you know that a snail can sleep for three years? Mmm, mmm. Can you even imagine waking up one day to realize that you've literally slept half of your life away? Nash, I heard you skipped Bible study. Yup. Sure did. I really don't care what they're crusading against. And Dad doesn't either. Your Dad... Got the role of a lifetime, Mom. Playing pastor was the only gig he could actually book. C'mon... You know it. We all know it. What? Hello. Yeah, she's right here. - It's for you. - Oh. Hello? - Nash, take a jacket! - No. Would you make him take a jacket? Elena? Oh, hi, Peyton! Do you remember the women's glory project I was talking about? I was wondering if I could see some samples of your work. I could, um... bring my portfolio over... I could even do it tomorrow. These are good. I'm impressed. Aww... She's beautiful. Children are my favorite subjects. I love the set-up. They're so innocent, so raw. They show everything they're feeling. I love this one. That's me, actually. It's great. I had an idea. I lit it, and I thought... might as well. It's really good. I mean, they are all good. Why didn't you keep this up? You know, family. Life. I think it's a wonderful project, Peyton. I think you would be great, if you're interested. Yes! I'm definitely interested. OK. So where did this idea come from? Well, my mom got really sick. We ended up connecting just more deeply, and I realized how much more interesting she was than I ever gave her credit for. And women are so complex, so multi-dimensional. I just want to dig in. I want to show all their colors... Show everything that makes a woman so delicious! Oh. I've got to run. Oh. But we can meet Sunday - if that's good for you, to keep things moving forward. Sure. That'd be great. - Bye. - Bye. Mmmm. How could you, of all people, manage to run out of coffee? Thank you so much. You can go. What's with you, ants in your pants? I have a business meeting. - Here? On a Sunday? - Yeah. I do. Um... Thank you so much for bringing this. Now give me a minute. - Oh! Hello! - Hi! It's Wave, right? Right! That would be me! So you must be the, uh, business meeting. - Yes. - Got it! - Come on in. - OK. Bye. When I say do stuff that feels good, I don't mean do straight, married stuff! OK. Don't start! Is this you? I mean, your story? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. I think of an agoraphobic, like in "Grey Gardens," you know, all huddled up in a corner with a bunch of cats! Yeah, well, all the new meds make us far more acceptable. Really, I would never have known. Can I make a suggestion? You need a new author's photo. This one just doesn't do you justice! It's not about what I look like in my line of work. It's more about my words. Nonsense. I'm going to do a new author's photo for you... My gift. OK. Man... # Tell me, are you wonderin'? # # Do you think you've gone mad? # # Are you speakin' another language # # That no one understands? # # 'Cause you talk to the ocean # # And you listen to the birds # # Everyone around you # # Wonders what you heard # # You're not broken # - I'm so sorry I'm late. - Hey! How are you? - Hi! - Hi! This is my son! Nash! I've heard about you. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - And you must be Tori. And you must be the writer! You know what my dream job would be? Research assistant. I mean, I would do the deepest, meanest, most intimate statistical research on any given topic, and I would correlate and extrapolate, and I would give meaning, meaning to each and every single part. And it would just be so amazing! She'd be really great at it. Checkmate. I win. That is why you never take your eye off the ball. That's right! Please, darling, don't eviscerate the poor child. - Hey, Ty. - Mmm? Tell Peyton the story. Alright, if you insist. So... This earnest young writer comes to Hollywood to make his mark, and all very Youngblood Hawke, right? Very soon he realizes that, um, life is... seldom the stuff of romance novels. He buys himself a Lexus... Per chance, did you drive a white Lexus? No. Don't even say it. The owner of the clunker turns out to be the very assistant who gave him his start. Can you believe it? They would come at the exact same time. Soulemetry, soulemetry. Three months later... - Married. - They were married. Do you love it? Do you love it?! A coincidence! That's why God performs a miracle and decides to remain anonymous. No. It's when God gives you a choice and you make the right one. That's the miracle. I thought she'd be great to have a child with, you know? Make a family... You know, Barry and I only have one thing in common, and that's our son, so... I don't know. Sometimes I just think I got married to rebel against my parents. My father's Indian. He's... very old school. You know, stern but quiet hand. My mother's from Spain... She's very Catholic. Now that's a lethal combination. I know! It really is! It really is. For years I just have felt like a mummy. Just... Yeah, at first I was really happy with Barry. After some time, I... I just started to think, what's wrong with me? Why don't I feel what everybody else feels? I don't think I've ever been in love with him. But he's in love with you? I don't know. I think sometimes, marriage is just a series of compromises that... I don't know. Maybe some of us are not meant to have a soulmate... Like Tyler thinks. What about you? - Me? - Yeah. Well... I don't know about soulmates, but... I'm with Margaret... After that... Frankly, my dear, I don't care if I never see another lesbian for as long as I live. I'm not kidding. Oh, goodness. All I really want is a baby. And honestly, that's probably all I ever needed in the first place. This point is key. Everything feels completely brand new, but absolutely familiar. OK, you... Sit. OK. Can I ask you something? Uh, oh. It's a rather personal question. Go ahead. How did you know you were gay? How'd you know you were straight? I mean, did you know from the beginning? No. Actually, I did the whole straight thing up until my early 20s. But then, I fell head over heels for this, um, photographer, actually. Mmmm. Well, we can be very deep. Hmmm. What about you? Well, I never knew you were supposed to be anything but straight. No school girl crushes? No... Royal Academy experimentation? Nothing. I never even kissed a girl. No. With my upbringing, that never really occurred to me. I guess I'm just a square! Or maybe you're just straight. You mind if I move around a little bit? Pardon me? Oh... No, yeah, no. Yeah, I think I got it. Got it. That was great. Uh, hey, Mama Bear. Hmmm? Are you aware that the entire time I've crashed here at your house, I have never once heard you whistle - a nonverbal expression of happiness or pleasure? Oh, come on. I'm sure I've whistled before. Hey, Tori... Do you know any... the gay girls at your school? You mean lesbians? Excuse me, but the last time I looked, you were hanging out with a lesbian named Peyton. Well, yeah, but Peyton's not really... Yeah, yeah, I know. She could pass for straight. Anyway, a normal person engages in the pursuit of kissing a mere 21,000 plus or minus minutes in their sorry little lives. Which boils down roughly to mere months. So, who cares who kissing whom? - Really? - Really! I mean, over the lifespan of an average 80-year-old, they're only having sex six times a year. I mean, we take more baths and eat more chocolate bars, for gosh sakes! And yet, this whole gay thing, literally, has everybody from the religious right all the way to Papa Bear's knickers in a twist. I know. And FYI... he's no fan of your new friend either. What?! Mom... Don't worry. Dad's just grumbling about how much time you and Peyton spend together. But I personally think it's kinda cool, 'cause you're not all caught up in the church, and it makes me kind of proud. Just so you're completely informed, Nash, according to the specialist who was on Queen Oprah the other day, straight women everywhere are suddenly wanting to be with other women - to experience their newfound, um, sexual fluidity. - You OK, Mom? - Yeah. Wow. Anyway... Um, lesbo 101 - in a nutshell. Yeah, but that's not my mom, so... Well, obviously, that's not Mama Bear. Don't get so defensive! Gosh! You know, I think you two are what Tyler calls Twin Flames. I do, and you found each other so early in life! Oh, Ma, come on! Think of all the time left you have to bicker, you two! Yeah. While your world's may seem utterly disconnected, the paths that you have individually taken bring you together at freakish randomness. My father was in the service so we jumped all over the world, and I made Spain my home. And my mother was a gypsy and so we travelled a lot, from one town to the next, and I ended up in LA. My best friend's brother, he had his wedding in New York, which is where we met. And we got stuck at the 'friends' table. You know, the table where nobody knows who the hell you are. You're just kind of like sitting there? And I, uh, I spilled champagne all over her dress. - Oh, all over my dress. - Yup. And then I freak, 'cause I, I realize how beautiful she is. - It still gives me goosebumps. - Yeah. We were born in the same town, Silverton, Oregon - less than 10,000 people - within a week of each other. We travelled nearly a million miles to find one another. And we did. And it is all because I asked him to pass the salt. You had that planned. I know. I did... It worked. I'm so glad that it's all going digity boop, you know? But, I don't know... Sounds a little scary, if I'm perfectly honest. Mmmm. I'm trying to talk to my friend? - Sorry. - God. Oh, hi! - You kill me. - I know. Seriously, though. C'mon. I think it's getting a little out of control, no? The unbuttoning of the shirt. What about all the eye blazing that goes on between you? I mean, come on. Who does that? Eye blazing? Seriously? You're the writer. Call it what you want. Seriously, though, you know, this is the oldest and most tragic game in the book! Lonely housewife meets quite fascinating lesbo to take a wee stroll on the wild side! You gotta grow some mini cojones - stat! You've gotta tell her what's going on. Yeah... No. No, no, no, I can't. Peyton, she's straight. And married to a pastor! Not to mention she's culturally challenged. It's kind of twisted how much you've got going against you. Alright, you belabor the obvious. I've added an assignment out of town. I'm gonna, when I come back... I've already decided. I'm gonna make myself less available. Actually unavailable. Oh! The I'm-too-busy-and- too-much-of-a-chicken-shit- to-tell-you-what's- really-going-on, fade-into-the-woodwork treatment. - Yup. - Oh. Well, I hope it works out. You came all the way over here to say that to me? - I did. - You could have just called. I did call. Hey! Hi! I wanted to show you these pictures. God, Peyton, you look amazing! Really... Great! Wow. Um, um... I should have called first, huh? No, no, it's just, you didn't have to come all the way over... here, that's all. Yeah, maybe this isn't a good time. No... No, no, no. I, I, I was actually, um - you know what? Uh, this is as good a time as any. Can you give me a second? OK... Oh, my God. What am I doing? Pants, pants, pants, pants... Oh! Shirt is over here, shirt, shirt, shirt. You're kidding. Oh, my God. She won't even care. You're straight. And married. No big deal. Just tell her... Oh, my God. OK. Hey. Look, Elena... I really should have called... first. I need to talk to you about something. Sure. Are you OK? No, actually. This, I mean, nothing serious, it's just that, um... I... Would you like some breakfast, English tea and breakfast? For God sakes, what's going on? Uh, this is ridiculous. Alright, um, first of all, you're straight. And second of all - you're straight and married. And my God... I so didn't want this to happen. I mean, you know that I'm a lesbian. Right? Um, yes. OK. So... that's it. That's what? - What? - What I just said. Which is? Ah! You know... I... really like you. I like you, too. More than I should. So... We don't, you know, have to talk about it or anything. I mean, I'm fine with that. I just think that if we just don't spend time... No! No! No, God, Peyton. No! I don't want to not spend time! I mean, you just heard what I said. Yes, but we... We need to be in each others lives! I just found you! You're my absolute best friend and I know we can get around this. No. I don't want to not be with you. And you can have all of me. All of it except for that. All of me. OK. Just so you know... That is a big deal for a lesbian. I mean, at least in the beginning. I just... Peyton, let's have some wine. Let's make a plan. Just please, please don't take you away from me. OK. OK. - I'll get some wine. - OK. Yes... these are God's children. But they have lost their way. And we cannot simply award this deviant path by allowing them the sacred sacrament of marriage. And they think if they can twist enough arms in the political arena that they can win this... prize. But marriage isn't a prize, is it? It's a gift. The greatest right that we have. And it should not be tarnished. It will NOT be tarnished! What the hell was that? Do you know what it looks like when you walk out of a sermon? Barry, don't. Look, you know, Elena, there's some of this stuff that I just have to do. Yes. I am familiar with the greater good speech. And you've always been good about these compromises - until now... You've had gay friends before. Back in your grand theater days. Nash, I'm just saying I think people should know they should not be rewarded for bad behavior. Bad behavior? Get real, Dad! Selling your soul is bad behavior. Loving someone isn't! You know, it's only a matter of time before this entire marriage discussion is so 2000 and late. Everyone knows Millie's the money at Papa Bear's church. Maybe we should cut him some slack, 'cause he's pretty screwed if he doesn't toe the line. Are you hungry? I'm going to make some dinner. This person makes you see the world through a different filter. No matter how hard you try, this person is suddenly living in every corner of your mind. I don't know what to say, I, um... You know, I spent the whole day looking at lesbian sites. No, I'm not attracted... to them. I'm not... attracted to any of the women in them... I don't think I'm a lesbian, Peyton. You're not the only one with feelings. Oh, I'm so confused, Peyton. Can't we just agree to call it a serious crush? Oh, all I can think about is... You OK? Yeah. Something's burning. Hey! Oh, I knew you'd feel like this. Oh, so soft. So soft like velvet. Stop. Don't go any further. You can leave now if you want to. Really? Are you afraid to be alone with me? Yes. Seriously? Seriously. Hi! Hey, are you busy? No, I'm free. Yeah. Do you want to have dinner? Great. I'll be there in 15 minutes. OK. - Hi! - Hi! I thought you guys went to the movies! We missed you too much. It was sold out, Mom. Can we have some burgers? - Dinner's in the fridge. - Awesome! - Did you pick up some beer? - In the fridge. Yes. I see. But only because God's love heals and allows me to see the sin within myself, to purge those temptations - those desires that are the devil's work. And only with God's love, God's glorious love... How many of us want to push those terrible urges from those base human impulses? Those craven desires of flesh that push us to do things we know are wrong? I don't know. I can't decide. I love this one. It's got this essence of like, comrades, you know? But this one - oh, it's just so damn good. What do you think? Hmmm? Make love to me, Peyton. I thought you wanted to wait... To see if you... Peyton, make love to me. I want to, Elena, trust me. But... once we go there, there's no going back. I don't want to go back. Are you OK? Yes. Are you? Elena... stay with me... Oh, I know how I knew. Um, when you kiss, it's like you live inside that kiss forever... Hey, sweetie, just give me a second. ... but yet it feels brand new. It is a good thing she is not a controlled substance. - Yeah! - That's all I'm sayin'. She's far more dangerous. OK, I'll bite. So... What's with the shimmering new and improved you, huh? Oh, Tyler... What you are doing is the very definition of insanity. I'm in love. For the first time, for the only time in my life. Gorgeous straight housewife. Never had sex with a woman before. Thinks she's died and gone to heaven. Now what? What happened to you telling me to do things that make me feel good? OK, I am trying to put my cynicism on one side. Good. 'Cause I'd just like to stay in my happy place for a second more, if you don't mind. Oh, happy place. Oh my God! Alright, OK. Now that you have completely taken my breath away, we're gonna sit down, and you're gonna tell me everything. Yeah, you two walk off into the sunset, no dead bodies strewn behind... Alright, I mean, every teeny, tiny, minuscule, minute, infinitesimal, mother fucking detail! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Are you done now? - Probably. - That's great. Now I have this big fat foreclosure sign on my happy place. I'm so happy! I can see it! Oh! It's OK. Perhaps some of you are thinking, epic love can't happen to me. But when true love enters your life, epic happens. We worked in the same company all of our lives. And for 27 years, we passed each other by and never said one word to each other. Sometimes he would nod and smile. But always very pleasant. Then I had a heart attack. I thought I don't have much more time to let things pass me by. I'm not going to waste one more minute. So when he came back to work, he came right up to me and said, I'm not going to waste one more minute of my life. I'm not Fred Astaire, but I'd like to take you dancing. And after three weeks of that wonderful dancing date, we were married. And we haven't spent a moment apart since. Mmm, hmm. The heart knows what the heart knows. - Right? - Right. You are desperate to be with them, and you will move heaven and earth to do so. I'm too old for youth camp, Dad. I'll drop you off with the seniors, and maybe Tori and I can just whoop it up. Come on. You always have fun. - Oh, alright. - I love you. Look. I know. You made it great! It looks wonderful! - Bye. - Bye, honey. I'll be back tomorrow. I'll give you a call later. OK... Bye. Bye! Everything's so different with you. Elena, what are you doing? What I want. Elena... Shhh... Peyton, I love you. Good morning! - There you go. - Thank you. We better not start. Eat. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you make breakfast for him like this? He doesn't eat breakfast. Anything else you'd like to know? Actually, yes. Look... It is what it is. Which is... what? - Which is what? - Peyton, don't. Tell me. I want to know. Oh, come on, like... how does it happen? How does he come on to you? - Oh, my God. - When? Like every other day? Every day? What about your date nights on Saturday? Is it like every Saturday or every other month... You really ask a lot of questions. What? I'm... I'm a woman. Tell me. Look, I don't know what you're hunting for, but the sad fact is that we just don't connect that way. I thought it would be easier to hear it means nothing, but it does not. Peyton, I have to tell you something. We are taking a vacation to Hawaii... It's our annual vacation... Oh! ...and I really wanted to tell you sooner, but I didn't want to ruin our time together. What? The little fact that you were going on some romantic vacation with your husband in Hawaii? I know, I know, I know. Come on! He hasn't touched me since we've been together. You know that, right? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What was I thinking? Who could think? You know what? You, you're gonna have to do it eventually. You'll end up doing it, right? It means nothing. No... You'll make us mean nothing. Great. Hi. I'll be there. How long will it be before you're home? Yes, I'll be there. - I have to go. - Go. See ya. Aren't you even going to kiss me goodbye? I will call you. I miss you. Honestly, I missed you before our last kiss was finished. I just want you to know that I am with you. Elena, your beauty radiates from your soul. I finally understand the cliched term - take one's breath away. You take my breath away. When you kiss me... Oh, God... When you kiss me, Elena... I remember the night you showed up and made love to me with no words. Elena, I have never let anyone have me, let anyone take me, ravage me, as I have let you. You have given me such a gift - the other side of myself. You've made me whole. Wow... Can anyone say, Outed in Maui? Yeah. I was looking for an aspirin in my mom's suitcase... This is what I found. I know you're upset. When you came after me... Everyone thought I was a goober. But you didn't care. I think, um... your mom's just following her heart. Hey. I never would have expected that to happen. I'm so sorry! Yeah, well... A lot of unexpected scenarios could have happened since your wedding anniversary's this weekend... Peyton, I'm... What? What? Never mind. I really have to go. - Um... - Alright. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Sure. I'm so sorry. I know this is the third time I've had to cancel... I want to see you. I need to see you. - Hey. - Hi. What's with you now? Nothing. I'm just tired. You're just tired? You had a long day? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, you know what? Maybe I'm tired... Maybe I've had a long day. What? Look... I don't want to fight. The last time I checked... there's two of us in this marriage! Is it too much time to ask to spend a little time on our anniversary? One of us is still here doing things. And the other one is just... letting everything slide. The laundry's sliding, Nash is sliding. This is sliding! I need to go to bed. Shit! Hey. Oh, I missed you! What is it? I just... want to look at you. I only have an hour. He didn't touch me. He didn't. What the hell are you doing home? You know better than to cut school. Oh... Is this the pot calling the kettle black? Father God knows all? Except for apparently what's going on around here. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, my God! Your son is quickly on the verge of becoming unmanageable. I'm always here for Nash! No! You're not! Nash is going through something right now, and I need you to get your head back in the game. I'm going to bed. I love the way you make me feel. And since your mom is missing half the goddamn time. Can you spell clueless? Hey! You don't talk to me that way. No matter what else happens, I'm still your father. Your mom is just following her heart. Every time I think it's impossible to love you more, I do. Ever deeper. Hello? Where is she? I've been calling non-stop for the past two hours. Tori? Look. I'm on your side, OK? So you can drop the pretense. Nash is in trouble. Tori? He lifted some really nasty Boonesberry, got snookered and then returned to the scene of the crime for some Doritos, of all things. - Is he safe? - Typical acting out with teens. Their frontal lobe doesn't take into consideration... - Tori! Is he safe? - Not to worry! Once they found out Papa Bear was a pastor, they let him out. Now they're both at home, wondering where you are. I gotta go. Nash? Nash? What were you thinking? What the hell were you thinking? Excuse me? What are we talking about here? You and your dirty little secret! Yeah! I read her letters! I even liked her! Nash! What were you doing going through my things?! Don't you dare turn this around on me. Nash, listen to me. I wasn't looking for this. God knows I don't really understand it. And I certainly didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. You are going to tell Dad. I certainly planned on telling him before you! So then what? Are you guys going to get a divorce? I'm not sure, Nash... I don't really know what I'm doing. Then stop! Now, I think he's an asshole half the time, but this will kill him, Mom. It will blow his whole ridiculous act. I mean, how's he supposed to guide his fawning flock when his wife is sleeping with the enemy? Nash, I need you to understand something. I have never been dishonest or cheated on your father before this. But I've never been in love with him either. Then why, Mom? Why stay with him this whole time? Why do you think, honey? It's OK, baby. Where were you? As if I have to ask. I already told you... I was at the park. Even with challenges seemingly insurmountable, true love will find a way. So we met in group. Big surprise. And, uh, it was weird because my Robert, who rarely comes out, just fell so head-over for her Jane. Thing is, her Jane is in control of all her personalities. Yeah, but it's still hell for me. Because when I want Robert, I have to do battle with all his alters. And to be quite frank, he's got some rather unappealing personas. But when Robert does come through... Oh, my God. My Jane is just so deeply and completely in love with him. I love you. Robert? Jane. I missed you so much. Hi. Hi. Come here. It may be cliche, but it's true. Love really can conquer just about anything out there. - Do you really think so? - I really think so. Look, I know things are crazy over there right now, but I just wanted to make sure Nash is OK. Call me. I feel like it's about to devastate everything I know. What am I doing? Look at all the people I'm hurting! You can't rewrite the past, but you can reframe the present. What a gift you have been given! I have never seen you so alive and joyous and in touch and full of passion! Peyton makes you breathe! - You alright? - Yeah. Are you sitting down? I'm telling you, I just saw her kissing another woman in the plain light of day. I knew something was up with her. Not wanting to protest, missing services. But this! I know this week has been really rough. She must be one of those... I can't even say it. I, I, I, don't... the word just doesn't come out of my mouth... Lesbian. Oh my gosh. She's going to hell. Maybe we should pull back a little, you know? Just until things settle down. You don't have to feel so guilty. And I can get my head screwed back on. Where is all this coming from? You don't get it. I am... too far in. I understand that you're scared, and all the reasons that you don't trust. Don't you know by now, Peyton, this is what I want? I have never lied to you. And I never will. I guess at this point, I really don't know that, Elena. You don't believe me? I knew when I was getting into it... It is what it is. I just... I just don't think I can do it. Peyton... This just can't happen overnight. I have been married for fifteen years. My family won't - they can't - understand this. Just give me some time. I... What? I can... I can work it out! I just need to know that you're going to be there with me. I believe they call that having your cake and eating it, too. I don't think that I can do this halfway. You are doing it halfway. I saw them with my own eyes, and it should come from me. He trusts me, and I'm the one to do it. Don't you see a future with us? Sorry. Maybe limited, but no, I... I'm sorry. # Pieces, falling # # Through the sky, I'm wanting # # To feel you beneath me # # But not like this, believe me # # No, I can't wake up # # No, I can't crash down # # To half that's lost # # And half that's found # # I can't believe that you # # Would leave me this way... # They were what? No way! # I am broken now into a thousand pieces # # You have stolen one # # It's a piece I needed # # I can't open up # # You can't close me shut # # I am broken... # # Pieces, floating # # Up off the ground exploding # # I feel you above me # # But not like this # # Don't rush me # # 'Cause I cannot look # # No, I cannot find # # The half that's yours # # And half that's mine # # I can't believe that you # # Would leave me this way # # I am broken up... ## Don't do this to us. Mommy! Mommy! Peyton, honey, what's wrong? Peyton, honey, what's the matter? It's Molly... She's moving. And I love her so much! Get a hold of yourself. Get a hold of yourself. This is an important lesson to learn in life. When you love, expect disappointment. It's just the way it is... It's just the way it is. And finally, this connection has fundamentally changed you... Significantly altered you to - the - core. You know what the hell you're doing? I didn't come to fight... I knew you'd need this. You know, Elena, maybe Nash was right. You know, maybe I am clueless, but I know one thing if I know nothing else. You are not a lesbian. You're right. I'm not. Then why the hell are you doin' this? To us? To Nash? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to me. And don't even get me started on how selfish this is. Nash needs us. You're right. Nash needs us. He needs us. The real us... The best of us! My God, Barry, I'm done lying... What? To him! To you! To myself! This... It has nothing to do with Peyton. It has everything to do with Peyton. This is my decision about my son and my life! I should have been done with this charade years ago! Charade? A Charade? Are you serious? You got on this thing from the very start! And that was selfish. Being here, and not really being inside it with you. I'm done with this Barry. And if it's selfish, so be it. - It is selfish. - Barry, I'm done with this. - Elena, l... - I'm done. I finished all the classes, did all the paperwork. She said that I can be looking at placements within weeks. Oh, God! And that's because you're not, you're not letting anything get in your way. No, no. No worries. Keeping one focus, and one focus only. Gosh, Wave, I'm going to be a mom! Yeah! I'll be right around for auntie duty just after that whaa! Stage. You'll be there. Hey, I know it's taken a while, but you finally look like you're among the living. And that would be the spray tan. Hey. Wow, that is so bizarre. I was just reading this morning about the correlation of coincidence with the concept of fatalism. Oh, yeah? Which would, you know, throw a great deal of weight to the premise that all of us running into one another was... probably inevitable. Elena. Hi. Oh, Christ. - Are you kidding me? - I can explain. - Don't. - Peyton. Just save it! Don't talk to my mom like that. - Peyton, please listen to me. - No, no, no. You've been fucking him this whole time? - No! - You played me! - I didn't. - Yeah, you did. You think you could just come into my world? I might be the fool, but you are nothing but a selfish whore. Elena! Elena! Help! Help! Somebody call 911! How could I go to the hospital? I don't belong there. You couldn't know. Peyton, you took a chance. You know, you took a huge, beautiful risk. She just doesn't quit! Does she? Sending you around here to do her dirty work for her. Peyton... She needs you. Nash... Please... Please. Peyton! You alright? She's fine. Baby's doing just dandy. Look, I'm glad everything's alright, but I have no idea why I'm here. Peyton, please. Just sit, and listen. I know you're upset... but please understand. This entire last year was never supposed to happen. It was never even imaginable to me. I fell in love with you... A woman. Yes, I'm pregnant, but it's not because I've been sleeping with Barry. Barry hasn't touched me since we started. It's Tyler... Tyler's the father. Trust me, we weren't sleeping together either. Lily would have... After all those years of infertility hell... Tyler offered and I accepted. It's my greatest contribution to mankind. - You OK? - Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? After all this time. My God, I was so hateful to you. Peyton, I must have tried to call you a thousand times, but I... I had things to take care of. Nash... Barry... Starting my divorce. And during that time, Tyler's little guys hit the jackpot, and I got pregnant. I just need you to know... that none... none of what we had was a lie. It was the truest thing I have ever known. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I was so hateful... I'm so sorry. Look at me. - You're pregnant! - Yeah. That's awesome! So awesome! I miss you. I miss you, too. You're so beautiful. Oh, I've missed you so much. I've missed you so much. # Suddenly... # # I want to know your life story # # Make a film of you # # And I... # # Want to read a book on you # # Finally, Suddenly... # Yes. All is as it should be.
