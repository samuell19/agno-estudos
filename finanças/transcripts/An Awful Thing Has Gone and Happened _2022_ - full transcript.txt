[ominous music] [bright, upbeat music] - [Broadcaster] Good morning to you. This is 103.3 FM, WKYZ. It's an early dark morning, and it looks like we might still have a little gloomy weather on the way. But enough about the weather. Let's get to Swap 'N Shop with me, Edie Jean. Looks like the phones are already blowing up, so we better get to it. [gun cocks] You're on the air with Edie Jean on Swap 'N Shop Radio. What's your name, where are you from? - [Caller] I'm Leanna. I'm wanting to sell a Japanese-- - Oh, I got this for you. - [Leanna] It's really in a good condition. You can even see the Japanese writing on it. - [Edie] You said you were looking to trade this sword. What were you looking for? - [Leanna] Possibly a goat. - [Caller] Chicken, guns. - [Edie] If you need taxidermy. - [Caller] Oh, hire your own. - [Edie] So, you heard her folks. she's looking for a farm animal that produces milk, maybe. - [Caller] Extra dog food that I'm not gonna need anymore, and I just need to get rid of it, I just wanna get rid of it. - Oh, I'm ready now. - [Caller] So, if anybody needs it, you know, it's the good stuff. - [Edie] Thanks for tuning in, folks. This is Edie Jean on 103.3 WKYZ. Always remember, if you want cash in your stash, you gotta get rid of the junk in your truck. Bye now. [crickets chirp] [soft, suspenseful music] [soil crunches] [soil rustles] [tape rips] - [Person With Flashlight] Augustus. What the shit have you got yourself into now? - [Augustus] Dad? - [Dad] Get out of the hole. - What are you doing here? [engine revs] [lamp clicks] [soft, suspenseful music] [gun cocks] - Fuck. - Who is it? - [Augustus] It's fucking Ramsey. - [Dad] Who's Ramsey? - [Augustus] Get down and shut up. - Seems like we had a breakdown in communication. You see, as I recall, the plan was that you leave the money with the man in town. And for some reason, that plan has changed. I don't particularly like it when things change. Here we are, fuckin' around in all this dark. And you're trying to take what is mine. But I'm gonna give you an opportunity to do the right thing and bring to me what is mine. [soft, tense music] - Oh, shit. - [Ramsey] Now, goddammit. - We gotta go. - [Ramsey] Gotcha. [suspenseful music] [gunshot blasts] [gunshot blasts] [bodies thud] [combatants grunt] [officer retches] - Oh, God. Yes, Sheriff, coming. - Well, this is fucked. - Yep. I can't even make out who he is for sure. He's probably been up there sometime. - Mm. I'm not so sure about that. I think some of the woodland creatures been workin' on him. [birds caw] [officer retches] [soft, ominous music] - There are three live shotgun rounds by the passenger side of the truck. Now, why would you dig a grave and not put a man in it? - Oh, I don't think that hole was made for putting in. I think it's for taking out now. Hey, you ever have any dealings with this guy, Augustus Lane? - Yeah, yeah, that's Jonathan Lane's boy. Why, you think that's him hanging up there? - Maybe, I don't know. It sure is looking that way. Now, hold him steady. It's slipping. - Hold, hold, hold. Shit. [officer retches] - Hey, come here. Come here. - Oh, God. - Right here. Goddamn, you show that man some fucking respect. I told you to hold. - I was trying. - Well, you need to try harder. Now, come on, let's get this body back to town. We're gonna be breaking some hearts. [telephone rings] - Hello? - Oh, good, you're at your desk. Hey, Birdie. Did you get my last minute note on the Jameson layout? - Oh, no, what do you need? - Oh, well, I gave a note to Jen to pass along. I guess she didn't. It's a small thing, I just think we need to tighten up a bit on the spring rushes. Just a lot of fluff in that section. - Okay. [cellphone rings] - Look, if you need to get that, I can come back. - I'll just tell them I'll call them back. One sec. Hello? - [Caller] Yes, hello. Is this Miss Birdie Lane? - Yes. - [Caller] Is your brother Augustus? - Yes. Can I call you-- - [Caller] I'm Tucker Riddles, the coroner for Unicoi County, and well, an awful thing has gone and happened. I'm afraid to say your brother, well, he was killed. Your brother, Augustus. - Killed? - [Tucker] That seems to be the case. - What happened? - [Tucker] I'm sorry, Ms. Lane, but as I'm sure you've seen on TV, I can't exactly go and talk about an open case. - Case? - [Tucker] Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, but, well, I had to go and declare your brother's death a homicide on account of, well, the evidence. But I really can't say anymore. - Have you talked to my father? - [Tucker] No. Now, it's the funniest thing. I've tried calling him and calling him, but for the life of me, I never did get ahold of him. Ms. Lane, I hate to ask this, but because I can't find your father, would you be able to come down here tomorrow and claim your brother's body? - I don't know. I can try. - [Tucker] Okay, honey, we'll see you tomorrow, then. Bye bye now. [phone clicks] [soft music] - Hey, Birdie. So, like we were talking about before. What the hell happened? - [Birdie] My brother died. - Oh, Birdie, I'm so sorry. Don't worry about the Jameson thing, okay? Take some time. I'm sure Jen is ready to step up and take the lead on this anyway, so. I mean, the client loves you. [manager laughs] But we'll make it work, so. - I wasn't close to him, but it's still shocking, you know? They need my help identifying him. I can still handle the-- [cellphone rings] - One second. Well, they're late. Yeah, well we're gonna have to rush the prints to get it done on time. I don't give a shit, make it happen. Anyways, okay, so are you sure you still wanna stay on this? Because I'd feel way more comfortable if you were. When can you be back in the office? - I don't really know. I'm not real sure what's-- [cellphone beeps] - Shit. Okay, look, I gotta put out another fire, okay? I'm trusting you to make this Jameson deal happen, okay? All right, you're my girl. [tongue clicks] All right. Oh, legal left a memo with a change. Can you give that to Jen for me? - No problem. - All right, thanks. [tongue clicks] [soft, somber music] - Dad. I just left the airport. I'm about 30 minutes away. Please call me back, please. [phone rings] - [Jen] Hello, this is Jen. - Hey, it's Birdie. Did you file those C-56 reports yet? - [Jen] I haven't yet, do you need me to do that now? - No, no, that's actually good. There's a change. So, on page 78, legal wants us, Hello? [distortion blares] Hello? [phone beeps] Shit. [Birdie sighs] [door knocks] Dad, please open up. It's Birdie. Come on, open the door. [door knocks] [footsteps clop] [window rattles] [Birdie sighs] [lamp clicks] Dad? Dad. [suitcase clicks] [lamp clicks] [Birdie sighs] [lamp clicks] [Birdie sighs] [phone rings] - [Jen] Hi, it's Jennifer, leave a message. - Hey, it's Birdie. Sorry it's late, I'm in the mountains without service. I'm gonna be out of the office for a few days, but I wanted to get you that change on 78. Legal wants us to say, "in perpetuity throughout the known universe." Okay, let me know if you have-- - [Automated Voice] You've reached the end of your message. To save, press one. To re-record, press two. [phone beeps] [paper rustles] - [Tucker] Hey, folks. It's that time of year again. Make sure you come on out and vote for Tucker Riddles for County Coroner. That's Tucker Riddles of Riddles & Son Funeral Home. We've been serving you and your family for the last 50 years, and it would be my honor to serve you as your county coroner. Go on now, get out there and vote for me, Tucker Riddles for Unicoi County Coroner. [soft, ominous music] [bicycle rattles] ♪ I want my phone call ♪ ♪ My phone call ♪ ♪ My mother fucking phone call ♪ ♪ My phone call ♪ ♪ My phone call ♪ ♪ I want my phone call ♪ - Now, look here, partner, that's enough. Can I help you? - Yeah. - I said, can I help you? - Yeah. My brother died, and someone told me to come in. - Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. Why don't you grab a seat, and the sheriff will be right with you. - Brooks? Brooks, it's me, Birdie. Augustus' sister. - Yeah. It's been a long time, Birdie. - It has. Did you hear about Augustus? - [Brooks] Yeah. Sorry about all that. - Thanks. - Where you been hiding? - Nashville. - Ooh, big time, little sis. - I don't know about all that. You still out doing stupid shit? [handcuffs rattle] - What it look like? - Honey, you just say the word, and I will gladly let you use this nightstick. - Oh no, that's okay. Do you know anyone who could have done this to him? - I don't know. - Bullshit. You know everybody here. - Bullshit, really? Has anyone ever told you how forced it sounds when you cuss, Birdie? It's not natural. - You're avoiding the fucking question. [Brooks sighs] - He got into some really dumb shit, and I didn't really run with him that much anymore. - Okay, well then who was he running with? [soft, tense music] - Let's just say I don't know them, I don't want them to know me, and you sure as fuck don't want them to know you. - Can you at least tell me their names? Maybe I could tell the sheriff. - Oh, excuse me, Sheriff? - Uh-huh? - She's that boy's sister. The one from the mountain. - Do what you know is right. - Sheriff's waiting on you. [soft, percussive music] [Sheriff sighs] - First of all, Ms. Lane, I want to apologize to you for Tucker Riddle's calling before we spoke. That's not how I do things. Now, I'm sorry about your brother. - Thank you. - I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you're up for it. When was the last time you spoke with Augustus? - It's been some time. He started to get into some trouble. I just didn't really feel comfortable being around him much anymore. - Well, what about your mother and your father? - Mom died when we were kids. - [Sheriff] I'm sorry. - It's okay. It was a long time ago. Have you talked to my father? - I was just about to ask you the same thing. - I tried calling him, and I went to his house last night, and he wasn't there. - Well, I've seen this before. I wouldn't worry too much, your dad will show up Now, did your brother and your father ever fight or get physical with one another? - Wait, are you suggesting that my father could have killed my brother? - I'm not trying to upset you here. - Well, then what are you trying to do? - I'm trying to un-muddy some water, sweetheart, okay? I know this isn't pleasant, but I've gotta ask you these kinds of questions-- - Well, the answer is no. My father would never hurt my brother. Or anyone. - Okay. I do need you to identify some items found with your brother, in case anything means something to you that can help us. - Do I have to look at his body? - [Sheriff] No. - Okay. [soft, percussive music] - Oh, you must be Ms. Lane. Tucker Riddles, we spoke on the phone the other day. Sheriff. - Goddammit, Tucker. The boy's hand is hanging out to go fix it. [Tucker speaks in a foreign language] [soft, playful music] [Tucker pants] [Tucker laughs] Sorry about that. Now, I have a few items we found on your brother, if you wouldn't mind taking a look at 'em. Now, these are all the items we found on your brother. No sticky fingers are out here, now. [Tucker chuckles] You may even count the money in his wallet, if you would like. - Thank you, Tucker. I can take it from here. - Oh yeah, absolutely, you do your thing. I'll just be right over here. Yep, either of you two need me for anything. I'll just be right here finishing my lunch. - Do you recognize this vehicle? - Yes. It's my brother's. - Is there anything else on the table that stands out to you? - This was my grandfather's. I think my father gave it to him. I remember when my father got it, when we were cleaning out my grandfather's house. He showed us how the blade had aged over the years, but how he kept it razor sharp. - I really appreciate you doing this. Now, is there anything else? - No. - Sheriff, Sheriff. I have some paperwork and a little bit of business to attend to with Ms. Lane, if you don't mind. It won't take very long. - All right. When you're finished up over here, just come across the street to my office. Tucker, a word. - [Tucker] Absolutely, Sheriff. - Did you get those fingerprints and DNA off to the TBI? - I got 'em addressed, stamped, and everything. - Good, I want those in the mail today. Is that clear? And one more thing, Tucker. - What's that, Sheriff? - Don't ever call a family member again, okay? - I am so sorry, Sheriff, I was just trying to help. - That's my job. You do your job, and I do my job. This is where you say, "I understand you, Sheriff." - I understand you, Sheriff. - Good. As for those fingerprints and DNA, I don't wanna repeat of the bank robbery. - Now, that was not my fault, Sheriff. - Oh, Tucker, we both know it was. [soft, percussive music] - You have a good day, Sheriff. Ms. Lane, Ms. Lane, right this way, Ms. Lane. [soft, somber organ music] [door creaks] [Tucker sighs] Sorry to keep you waiting. Gotta be willing to change hats in this economy. [Tucker sighs] It's been a busy day. We had a bus come in from Gallatin the other day with the track team on it, the girls track team. Bam, head on with a drunk driver, lost three of 'em. Sad, sad, sad. Your brother's gonna have some company downstairs tonight. It's too bad it couldn't been four of 'em. The drunk driver, dear. I meant that drunk bastard survived, unfortunately. You know, I've always been told that if you're the drunk driver, your body goes limp like jello, so there's a better chance of survival. [Tucker sighs] Such a shame. But enough about that business. I'm real sorry to hear about you, brother. I didn't know him personally, but here's what I've been thinking. - I would really prefer if my father be here. - Nobody's been able to find him since, you know. I'm sure he's fine. Man who loses a child like that? Probably just wants to be alone for a little while. - I don't know if I-- - I understand, but on the other hand, time waits for no one. It's already been a while, and if we don't do something soon, we're gonna have a situation on our hands that really stinks, if you know what I mean? Someone's got to step up, is that gonna be you? I don't think you want the county to do it. - It seems that way. - Good, now, was your brother into sports? I got some real nice sports-themed coffins here. Young man like that had to be into sports. - [Birdie] I don't know, really. - Okay, okay. Well, what about this one here? That's real mahogany, nothing like going out in style. Plus, this one also has the ultra protection package. No water's gonna be seeping in there 'til Jesus Christ himself pulls him outta the ground. Now, would you look at that? All those flowers arranged with the bright colors, contrasting with the dark wood? What a great combination. If money is a problem, I got a real nice payment plan. 0% down at 8%, that's not bad. - This all just seems a little-- - If you just gimme your credit card, I can set it up as an easy recurring payment. - No. - [Tucker] What's that sweetie? - I said, no. - We can't just leave 'em in the basement. Something's gotta be done. [Tucker sighs] Okay, okay, let's look at a few other budget options. Have we thought about cremation? I got some real nice urns. - Fine. - Great, now we're cooking with gas. Now, number 38 here, that's real nice. That's inlaid with pewter. - Okay. - A very lovely decision. Any family coming into town? - My father and I will be there. - [Tucker] What about friends? - [Birdie] I don't know, really. - At least everybody's got one friend. - I'm sure he has friends, I just don't know them. - Well, we could do a visitation of friends between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM two days from today. - Okay. - Okay then, we are agreed. Now, will that be cash or credit? We don't accept out-of-state checks, and there's a 3% charge on credit cards. [purse rustles] Cheryl? [door creaks] Cheryl, would you be a dear and run this for me please? Thank you. [Cheryl coughs] Cheryl is the last living of her family. I'm sure I'm gonna be doing her funeral next. That family has been good business for me. Her father went hosing down the ticket-taker over at the Palace Theater. I could never understand those two. He had to be 25 years her senior. But when we pulled that sheet back from that man's naked body, there was an audible gasp. [Tucker chuckles] Her brother, on the other hand, ought to be up for a Dumbass of the Year in the Tri-State Area award. He and his buddy were working on a car. They had the bright idea of attaching Duane underneath so he could see what was clanking back and forth. [Tucker sighs] He was a little touch, that one. Had to use a shovel, there. [door creaks] Thank you, Cheryl. [door creaks] Now, all that's left is your John Hancock on the line right there. [pen scribbles] I promise you, we're gonna take real good care of your brother, and I hope this isn't being too forward, but whatever unfortunate circumstances your brother was into, I wouldn't go looking for 'em. We'll see you in a couple of days. - Okay. [soft, tense music] - Hey there, sweetheart. You miss me? - I thought you were-- - Just hibernating. Now, where's my fucking money? - Money? The driver. The driver never brought it to me. I swear I didn't touch it. - You know, it's funny, it seems with time, people forget loyalty and fear. But I'm here to assure you and them that fear is never really gone. Believe me. Now, are you loyal, or are you afraid? - Yes. - Oh, so we're in agreement. Good. So, where is my money? - That's lunchtime. I'm going down to Jackie's, you want anything? - Yeah. I'll take the lunch special. Thanks, Cheryl. [Cheryl coughs] - Did she just turn the lights off on us? [door clangs] - Seems that way. - You know I'm gonna have to kill you if you don't get me my money, right? - Yeah, I thought that might be the case. - All right, then. [soft, percussive music] - Excuse me. [Birdie sighs] - Excuse me, sir. Do you know why they're taking him? - He's being processed for county jail. I'd stay away from that boy, hun. You don't want to get mixed up with that. - Does he know something about my brother? - I'm not sure yet. Did you get everything wrapped up with Tucker? - I don't know yet. - [Sheriff] Do you need a ride home? - I've got my bike. - I'll take you. I was hoping to catch up with your father there, anyway. - Me too. - Birdie, do you mind if I take a look around your dad's house? - I don't know, I'd rather wait till dad comes home. - Yeah, see, I don't know when your dad's gonna be back. - It's his house. - Yeah, I don't know when he is gonna be back, and I need to find out what happened to your brother. Something in the house might lead me in the right direction. - [Birdie] Dad. - Birdie, stop. [ominous, suspenseful music] Birdie, go to my car, wait there. Go, now. I thought I told you to stay at the car. Well, you can come in now, it's clear now. - This is about my brother, isn't it? - I think you're probably right about that. Somebody spent some time here, and whatever they were looking for, they really want it. Now, you let me know if you see anything missing. One little thing can lead to a big thing. I'm gonna go call it in. [soft, suspenseful music] - Don't look up. I don't want to hurt you. But if you move, I will. Now, I'm just gonna step down here, and if you're a good girl, I won't shoot you, okay? Do we have a deal? I think might be taking you with me 'til we sort this all out. - [Sheriff] Did you find anything missing back there? - Is that the good Sheriff Mayfield herself? You don't want a third eye, do you? - You okay? - You tell her you're in the bathroom taking the shit. Do it now. - I'm okay. I'm in the bathroom. It might be a minute. - Very nice. You conveniently left out that part where you were taking a shit, but I believed you. [Ramsey softly chuckles] - Get out of my father's house. - No shit. This is interesting. You're the old man's daughter? Now, I'm intrigued. You wouldn't happen to know where your dip-shit brother is, would you? - At the county morgue. - Don't gimme that bullshit, where is he? - I'm not bullshitting you. They found him dead in the mountains. - Well, ain't this some confusing shit? Okay, since you left out that specific detail that you're taking a huge shit in that bathroom, the sheriff out there, she's gonna start getting suspicious. What you're gonna do next is walk over to the bed and take off that pillowcase. Get to it, princess. Get going, I won't think twice about spitting your wig, I promise you. Hey, you know better than to turn around. We've been over this. Back straight up to me. Nice and slow. That's it, good girl. Come on, baby, come to daddy. Come on. There ya go, good, good. Okay. [Birdie pants] [knife clicks] [soft, percussive music] Sheriff Mayfield. Go ahead and take your hand away from that man-killer. - Deputies are on their way, you need to put your gun down. - No. - No? - That's right, no. You wouldn't be the first I sent to the great darkness. But I got better things to do. And the best option is for you to put your gun right there in front of that sandwich on the table. That way, we can all see the sunset tonight. Wouldn't that be nice, Sheriff Mayfield? Hold on there. Nice and slow. There you go, I appreciate your cooperation. Alright, princess, go ahead and take a seat right there next to the sheriff. That's a good girl. Alright, both of you, please, put your hands palms-up on the table. All right. Everything's good, as long as all of us get along. Right, Sheriff? [Ramsey chuckles] Shit, princess, your daddy must buy the damn cheapest bread in town, that's dry as fuck. Go over to your daddy fridge there and see if there's any milk that's worth a damn. Come on. [soft, percussive music] What a time to be alive. What did we do without ultra-pasteurized milk? And this son of a bitch still got what? Two more weeks left, yeah. [glass clinks] [milk gurgles] When. [glass clinks] Excuse my manners. [milk gurgles] [Ramsey sighs] Good stuff. There. Wow, Sheriff, I bet this thing's a real tack driver, huh? Sheriff Mayfield, am I holding the gun that killed those two men in that robbery a while back? [telephone rings] [Ramsey laughs] This is history I'm holding in my hand, huh? That was like some OK Corral shit, huh? Can I call you Wyatt? Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Earp. [answering machine beeps] - Hey, Birdie. - The fuck? - I wanted to let you know the timeline is shifting again on Jameson. - Hello? - [Supervisor] Hello, who's this? I need to talk to Birdie. - Oh, she's sitting right here, what can I do you for? - [Supervisor] Well, it's urgent. There have been some changes. Can you just put it on the phone, please? - Oh, okay, well hang on. Just calm down, hang on. There's been some changes. You know about some changes? Well, she told me to tell you to go fuck yourself. - [Supervisor] What, what? - I'm sorry, she's just shaking her head, telling me to tell you to go fuck yourself. - [Supervisor] Okay this is important, asshole. - I'm sure it is. - Can you put her on the phone, please? [phone thuds] - Sounds like you might be looking for a new job. - [Supervisor] Put her on the phone. Grab her right now. - Sheriff. Birdie? Fuck! - I heard you laid those boys down center mass, yeah, and a headshot bonus. Come on, Sheriff. After you pulled that trigger on the first one, I bet it was like satisfying an itch you could finally reach on your back. Don't lie. I mean, hey, it's all right if it was. We all get a little excited when we take a life. [Ramsey chuckles] You open that hand. Open it. [tense music] You see, as the hero, Sheriff Mayfield knows, there's nothing like sending a man off into the great darkness. Uh-huh, especially when they deserve it. Yep. You know, sometimes, I imagine I'm sending those ahead of me to make a place for me in all that dark. Yep. Now, Sheriff, if I'm not mistaken, there were three bad guys in that bank. So, let's do the math. You got two of them, so one of them got away. Didn't they? Didn't he do a deputy in? Price of being an American hero. - His name is Anthony. - Well, here's to Anthony. Wrong place, wrong time, my boy. Well, [guns clink] I finished my lunch. This has been a wonderful conversation, and I really do appreciate your cooperation, Sheriff. Now, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take this piece of history with me, because I don't want to end up history. Sheriff Mayfield, go ahead, pull out those handcuffs you got there and place 'em on the table. [handcuffs jangle] Go ahead and take them cuffs and run 'em through that refrigerator handle. [gun clicks] Yep. That's it, cuff yourself. [handcuffs click] Well, princess and I best be going now, Sheriff. Good luck and good help to you. Get up. Oh, and Sheriff Mayfield, I hope you and I never meet with guns drawn. I know you shoot to kill. [Ramsey chuckles] Oh, hey, one more thing. Do you think you'll ever catch him? - Who? - The third man from the bank. You know, the one that put, what was his name? Anthony, yeah, Anthony, six feet down. - One way, or another. - I thought you might say that. [gunshots blast] - Birdie? Birdie, Birdie? Birdie, come on, I need you to get these keys. Birdie? Birdie, come on, baby. - Do you still think my dad's involved in all this? [soft, percussive music] - Okay, I'm gonna leave a deputy out front in case you need anything. - Thank you, Sheriff. - Are you sure you wanna stay here? - I wanna be here when my dad gets home. [soft, somber music] [phone clicks] [phone dials] - [Supervisor] Hello? - Hey, it's Birdie. I wanted to apologize for earlier. What he said was completely inappropriate. - [Supervisor] That's a bit of an understatement. - He was just trying to get me in trouble by pissing you off. - [Supervisor] It worked. Birdie, I have to know I can get a hold of you when I need to, okay? And count on you to be a professional. - You can, of course. - [Supervisor] Well, if I'm being honest, it doesn't seem that way. You've still got loose ends to tie up on the Jameson doc before we pitch it at the end of the week. So, how are you gonna do that from there? - I know, I'm working on it. There's just a lot going on here. [Supervisor sighs] - I'm gonna have Jen head up the project on this round. It sounds like you need more time. Birdie? Birdie? - Sure. [phone clicks] - [Automated Voice] You have one saved message. [answering machine clicks] - [Brooks] Mr. Lane, it's Brooks, Please call me back as soon as you get this. [soft, suspenseful music] - [Automated Voice] You have one saved message. [answering machine clicks] - [Brooks] Mr. Lane, it's Brooks. Please call me back as soon as you get this. - That lying asshole. [cell clangs] - What are you doing here? - Bailed you out. - That was mighty nice of you. You have a good day. - Wait, stop. I said stop. - I need your help. My dad still hasn't come home. - I can't help you. - Oh, fuck you, Brooks. I know you lied. You called my father, I heard you on the answering machine. - Okay, yeah, I called your dad. But look, he didn't answer, okay? I heard Augustus got into some trouble, and I wanted to see if he was okay. Augustus was my brother, too. - If he was your brother, then help find your father. - Let's get one thing straight. If I take you to these bad men you so desperately want to meet, then will you be satisfied? All right. But to be clear, you won't see me standing next to you when you're around them, you understand? - Yeah, I understand. - Got any money? [money rustles] - Uh-uh. We're gonna have to go find an ATM, because this ain't enough money. Where's your car? [telephone rings] - [Davis] You got Davis. - Hey, Davis. This is Sheriff Mayfield. - [Davis] Hey, Sheriff. What can I help you with? - We just had a homicide the other day, and the coroner's supposed to send the fingerprints and DNA into your office. I wanna make sure you let me know when they get there. - [Davis] Turn around for processing, it's gonna take some time. - Yeah, that's all right. Just let me know if they make it there or if they don't. We know who we're dealing with, right? - [Davis] Okay. I'll give you a call and let you know. - I appreciate it. [cellphone beeps] - Shit. - Shit, shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [bicycle clangs] Ow, damn it. - What the hell is going on out here? - [Brooks] Hey man, it's E. - I know who the fuck you are. Now, who's that? I don't know her, and I don't like people I don't know coming around messing with my shit! - She's cool she's cool. We're just trying to get her a burner, you know? Something a little small she can carry. - A gun? - I'm sitting down to eat my dinner, I'm closed. - [Brooks] Look, I'm just trying to help a friend out here. - Well, fuck you and your friend. I got a steak getting cold. - Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Maybe we can negotiate a dinner interrupters fee. - You too get your asses in here. But I'm not making a deal until I'm done with my dinner. Next time you see somebody come up here you don't know, pick up that son of a bitch and point it at 'em. Fuck. [soft, percussive music] - So yeah man, I appreciate you doing this. Hey man, where's your dog? - Had to put a bullet in its head. Couldn't get up to take a piss. - [Brooks] Sorry to hear about that. Must be tough. [Samuel sobs] [gun clicks] Oh, come on. Come on, man. You know me. You know me, come on. - Did you know that dog saved my fucking life? One evening, he kept pawning at my leg, Rubbed my groin to the point there was a large bruise on that shit the next day. He wouldn't leave it alone. So, I went to the doc, had him checked that out. He said, that dog saved my fucking life, that I had a blood clot. And that son of a bitch would've let loose, I'd have had a pulmonary embolism. He was a good boy. Good boy. [soft, percussive music] Now, who are you? - Man, I told you. - You shut the fuck up. Whoever has the gun in this room gets to speak, and everybody else listens. And right now, I'm the motherfucker with the gun. You look familiar. That makes me nervous. Kind of makes me think about putting a bullet in your fucking head and burying you out next to the good boy. - I'm no one to you. I'm just a person who wants to buy a gun and get the hell outta here. - I got it. I know who you are. Your brother's Augustus. He got himself into some shit and got himself killed. - [Brooks] Can I ask you something? - What? - Are you high? - I'm not high. Johnny on the spot on the porch out there is fucking high. And I am. [Samuel chuckles] What are y'all waiting on? Come back here and get you a gun. [soft, percussive music] Welcome to the showroom. So, these are the four I'd recommend. Just a few moving pieces, easy to handle. Just what a lady needs. You know, not a bunch of recoil. Just in case you do have to shoot twice, you can get back on Target quickly. - How much for this one? - $350, and that's my acquaintance price. Y'all ain't my friends, so you don't get my friend's price. - What the heck? $350? Shit, I think I'm the one that sold you the gun. You gave me $75 for it. - You interrupted my dinner, and now, you want to gimme about the price? - I'll give you $250. - What? - I can make that work. - But I want some bullets for it, too. - Oh, I got you, I got you. These sons of bitches right here, punch through a car door. [money rustles] You bet. Now y'all don't mind, why don't y'all get the fuck out? [soft, ominous music] - Okay, what's next? - Okay, so I'm gonna go talk to some guys and see what I can figure out. - I'm coming with you. - Did you nod off while we were in there? Did you not see how he reacted about not knowing you? That's gonna happen 10 fucking times, and then one of them is gonna kill you, all because they don't know you. And then, one of them is gonna kill me. So, I'm gonna need the rest of the money. - No, I'm not gonna let you just take my money and run off. - You're just gonna have to trust me. - Okay. - Okay, what? - I trust you, but you've gotten to the funeral to bring me something or I'm going to the bondsman, and I'm pulling that bail deposit. - Okay, fine. Now, can you take me to my car, please? [soft, ominous music] - Birdie's in town, and she's asking a lot of questions. She's becoming a problem. - I'll get rid of her. [suspenseful music] [soft, tense music] [gun clicks] - There ya go. Hey, buddy. [hands clap] [gun clicks] [shells clink] [gun clanks] - Come on, Ramsey. You know I never do something stupid like that. - Where's Augustus? - Augustus is dead, they found him up on-- - Don't gimme none that, I know you know where he is. - He's dead. Ramsey. - You don't get to decide that. - I don't know, maybe check the goddamn funeral home. [table clanks] [Samuel groans] Oh fuck, fuck. You're crushing my balls. - Where is he? - I don't know how else to say it, man, the son of a bitch is dead. [table clanks] [Samuel groans] Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but I know his buddy, E. - E? what's his Christian name? - You know, it's craziest thing. I've known the dude five years now I don't have a clue. - Okay, where can I find this E? - I don't know. He was just in here with Gus' sister a couple hours ago. - Ooh. What'd they come all the way out here for? Were they looking for me? - No, no, I sold her a gun. - [Ramsey] You sold her a fucking gun? - Well, yeah, I'm a gun runner. I saw guns, sir. - Right, you buy guns that meth heads lift off their parents. You're not the former Soviet Union running RPGs. [Ramsey chuckles] [steam whistles] - You know, I always thought you and I could be friends, but fuck you. Oh, shit. [water splashes] Shit, shit. - Dumbass, you're a dumbass. [Ramsey grunts] [soft, somber organ music] I'm sorry I abandoned you. I never should have left. - [Tucker] We'll be starting soon, my dear. - Go ahead without me. - But darling, you're his only next of kin here. Don't you think you should be here for his-- - My father and I will send him off together. - We gather here today to remember our friend, Augustus Beauregard Lane. Sometimes Gus, sometimes Bo, but we all knew him has our friend. The good Lord giveth, and the good Lord, [cellphone rings] We are all but stardust. - Hello? - [Davis] Hey Sheriff, this is Davis. - Hey. - You called? - Did you get that package? - [Davis] Yeah, we got it, Sheriff, but-- - Great. - How quickly do you think you-- - [Davis] Now, hold on. - What? - [Davis] Well, we got the envelope, but there's nothing in it. - What do you mean there's nothing in it? - [Davis] Well, it was all sealed up, and then we opened it, and there was nothing inside, just empty. - [Tucker] To remember our friend. - All right, appreciate it. [tape machine clicks] [soft piano music] ♪ Amazing grace ♪ - I gotta go. ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ - Birdie, what the hell are you doing? - Tell me what you have, now. I know you know more than you've been telling me. - Okay, okay. But just sit down and stay calm. - This is me calm. - Look, I've got a meeting set up tomorrow, all right? - Fuck that. You make it now. - Now, just calm down now, Sheriff, just calm down. - Where in the fuck is it? - What are you talking about, Sheriff? - The fingerprints and DNA. - I sent 'em to the TBI, just like you told me to. - The package was empty. - Oh, gee, Sheriff. You know how the post office is, they got that slow girl working behind the counter, you know, misplaces stuff all the time. Shit, I hope it didn't fall out. - You lying son of a bitch. You just conducted a funeral ceremony and don't even really know who's in that urn. Goddamn you, Tucker. Goddamn you. - I'm sorry, Sheriff but it's not my fault. [Tucker sighs] [soft, ominous music] - This way. Coming, or not? [soft, suspenseful music] - I heard you had some information about my brother and father. - This is a dangerous game. It's time to get the fuck out of town. - I want to know. - You have until morning, or we will kill you. - This guy seems serious. I think we should do when he says. It's okay, man, just stay calm. We're leaving, okay? Let's go. - No. I'm not gonna let some in a mask tell me what to do again. [gunshot blasts] [distortion blares] - If you kill him, he can't tell you anything. - Fuck. [shadowy figure groans] [Birdie screams] - Holy shit. [fist thuds] - Look at me, you little shit. Augustus? [soft, tender piano music] - Hey, Birdie. But dad? - Ramsey killed him. I couldn't stop him. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? - Fuck. - Hey, chill out. - Fuck off. - God. Jesus, Birdie. - Fuck. [Birdie grunts] [Augustus groans] - Fuck. - Fucking piece of shit. - That's enough. [Augustus groans] That's enough, goddammit. I'm the one who drove your father up that mountain that night. I knew Augustus was gonna take all of Ramsey's money. I called your father that night. I thought maybe we can catch up to Augustus. I knew your father was the only one that could talk him out of it. Your father wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for me. When we got there, I followed them into the woods. I found Augustus, but Ramsey already had your father. There was nothing we could do. - There were two of you and one of him. There were thousands of options on the table, and you chose fear. You cowards. Both of you. You knew my father was dead and that was alive this whole time. - I was trying to protect him. And you. - I don't need your protection. - Ramsey will not show restraint with your life, or your brother's. - And you shouldn't even be here. I mean, what were you fucking think-- - Who shouldn't be here? [soft, percussive music] You're supposed to be dead. We just went to your fucking funeral, for Christ's sake. [Birdie pants] - God, Jesus. - [Brooks] Birdie, Christ. - Jesus Christ, Birdie. Birdie, cut it out. - Did you see him die? [soft, somber music] Coward. Why didn't you go to the Sheriff? You two motherfuckers have a chance to do the right thing for once in your sorry life. Do you not think that Ramsey could reach out and touch us from prison? You know he's not gonna stop until he gets his money, or we're dead. - Then we'll give him the money. - What? - We are gonna give him the money. Now, get in the fucking car. - You're getting better at cursing. [soft, tense music] - Oh my God, I am fucked. I'm fucked. - Calm down. I'll talk first. Ramsey's on the lake, hiding out on an island. - He's on a fucking island? - Yeah, he feels safe there. - How did you know about the money in the first place? - I heard Ramsey running in his mouth about hiding it one night. - You sure you weren't at the bank? You didn't know anything about it? - I had nothing to do with that. - Where's the money now? - I lost it in the woods. - Bullshit. When this is all over, you're gonna get me that money, and we're going to put it back where it belongs. Nobody is gonna profit from my deputy's death. He's your responsibility now. Apparently, you're the only one that can get him to do the right thing. - We'll get the money back. [soft, somber music] Dad, I'm so sorry for all this. - Birdie, I-- - Augustus, - Birdie. - Augustus. - It's all right, don't worry. It's okay. It's okay. - I love you. - You know I love you, Birdie. - Where's the money, Augustus? [Birdie gasps] You guys are fucking idiots. - We're looking for a mean son of a named Ramsey. Bald, short, plenty of tattoos, okay? He has no problem going for you, so make sure you got each other's back. [telephone thuds] - Call him. [soft, suspenseful music] Do it. [telephone dials] [telephone rings] - [Ramsey] Gus. - [Augustus] Ramsey. - [Ramsey] Now, this is a goddamned pleasant surprise. This is nice. - We have your money. [Ramsey chuckles] - [Ramsey] That's good, princess, that's real good. - [Birdie] I'm not your princess. - [Ramsey] Now, now, princess. Are you ready to make things right? - [Birdie] I'm ready for this to be over. - [Ramsey] Hmm. You know, I should kill your brother for this. In a way, he's a mass murderer. Look at all the people that have died because of his choices, mm-mm-mm. - Sheriff, I got eyes on him. [cop softly whistles] Sheriff's Department, put your hands over your head. Do it slow. - Can I put my dick away first? - Well, I ain't touching it, you son of a bitch. Go ahead, do it slow. - Is there any other way, pig? - Well, yeah. Drop that phone. [phone rattles] Put your hands behind your back. [handcuffs rattle] Shoot. Sheriff, this ain't him. - Shit. - [Birdie] The money for my brother's life, or I'll burn it. - [Ramsey] It sounds like I'm getting a better deal. I don't think your brother's life worth that much. - I want it done today. Come to my father's house, and the money is yours. - Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm close by. I'll be right there. [phone clicks] [soft, suspenseful music] - That motherfucker. We're dead. - We stick to the plan. Brooks, take the rifle and go to the tree line, now. - Check and see how close he is. - Augustus. - Sorry, Birdie. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry about this. [Birdie groans] [zip tie clicks] Stay here, Birdie, okay? Come on, come on. I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this shit. But I'm fixing my mistake. [doors rattle] - You can't do this by yourself. That son of a bitch will kill you. [Birdie groans] - Maybe so. [soft, somber music] If I see Dad, I'll tell me you love him. I'm sorry, Birdie. [Birdie groans] - You stubborn motherfucker. - You know, you are getting good at that cursing thing. [Birdie grunts] [soft, tense music] [suitcase clicks] [phone rings] [answering machine beeps] - [Sheriff] Birdie. Birdie, you lied to me. Whatever it is you're doing, stop. Stop, pick up the phone. Birdie-- - If you would like to rerecord your message, press-- [cellphone beeps] [Brooks sighs] - Oh, come on. [Birdie groans] - Been a long time, Gus. How you been keeping? - It's Augustus. - I really hoped this whole thing would've gone a lot smoother, you know? You get your money, I get my money, no one tries to fucking kill the other one. - Yup. - Yup, yup. Fuck your yup. Have I done something to upset you? Well, I guess I did kill your daddy. - There was no reason to kill him. - Hey, don't put that shit on me. I may be the one who sent him into the dark. I wasn't the reason he was on that mountain, was I? I wasn't the one who tried to steal from a friend. That's on you, Gus. [Birdie pants] [Birdie chuckles] [bed rattles] [Birdie pants] - I should have never listened to you. That plan was fucked to begin with. - You fuckin' didn't listen to me. If you would've been listening, you would've just waited and stayed calm, and not tried to me outta my share of money. Everything would've been fine. Those boys that died in the bank? They knew it could happen, and that's just part of the deal. The deputy, his job is to die for the people. Protect and serve. Without us, he had no purpose. We made him a goddamned hero. - Well, I guess that makes us the goddamned villains. - We're not villains, we're job security. Now, gimme my goddamned money. [gun cocks] [zip tie clicks] - Fuck. [scissors rattle] [Birdie pants] [gun clicks] - Now, I really do hate to see you in this type of situation, dear, but I'm afraid you and I are just gonna have to sit here for a moment and see how all this works out. Now, why don't you be a deer and just slowly lower it down. Atta-girl. Be a doll and drag those two chairs over here. You and I are gonna have us a seat and watch the show. [soft, tense music] [binoculars rattle] - Go ahead and pick him up. Now, look back over towards your daddy's house. [soft, suspenseful music] - I'm gonna kill you. Well, if you kill me, he kills her. It's your basic lose-lose situation. What I recommend is, you put that money on the ground and back the fuck up. You see my hand? Answer me, do you see my fuckin' hand? - Yes. Yes. - Good. This hand signals life or death. I keep it low, your sister lives. I send it into the air, your sister dies. Do you understand that? - Yes. - Good, now back away from my money. [gun cocks] - Alright, that's enough of that, now. Go ahead and put your gun down. - Sheriff Mayfield, what's the kill range on that shotgun? Is it 40, maybe 50 yards, max? - You sure you wanna take that chance? - All right, Sheriff. You got me. - Brooks. [Tucker sighs] Well, looks like it's going poorly. [Birdie sighs] - You know what, Sheriff? I think I will take my chances. [gunshots blast] [Birdie pants] [soft, tense music] [gunshot blasts] [Brooks pants] - Shit. [gun cocks] [gunshots blast] [Birdie pants] [Ramsey loudly moans] [gun clicks] No, no, no. Shit. Fuck, goddamn it. - No! No. [Birdie sobs] [soft, bright, somber music] - Hey, princess. You know it's his fault. It's all his fucking fault. That's it, princess, come on over here. Come on, it's okay. Come on over. That's it. That's it, princess, come on over here. Come on. - You've taken everything from me. - Not yet. [gunshots blast] [gun rattles] [cellphone rings] - Hello? - [Supervisor] Hey, Birdie. Listen, Jen's made a real mess-- - Go fuck yourself. - [Supervisor] What, what? - I quit. Fuck. [Birdie screams] [soft, somber music] [Sheriff sighs] - Well, that didn't really go as planned. [Sheriff grunts] - Never does. - [Tucker] It would be my honor to serve you as the county coroner. Go on, now. Get out there and vote for me. Tucker Riddles for Unicoi County Coroner. Hey folks, it's that time of year again. Make sure you come on out and vote for Tucker Riddles for County Coroner. That's Tucker Riddles of Riddles & Son Funeral Home. We've been serving you and your family for the last 50 years, and it would be my honor to serve you as your county coroner. So, go on now, get out there and vote for me. Tucker Riddles for you Unicoi County Coroner. Hey folks, it's that time of year again. [Birdie sighs] [soft, ominous music]
