It was literally one of the most traumatizing I've ever had in my whole goddamned life. Turn that shit down. Ain't gonna tell you guys again. It was probably my 8th birthday. My mother was yelling at me. She was like, "Hey, you clown. Why don't you go to the fucking clown prison or the circus is gonna come over here and take you away with all the rest of you and the rest of the clowns." That's what she kept telling me, because my mom was a clown, just like you two clowns, playing this NSA bullshit. That's what it is, you clowns. Two fucking clowns! Goddamn it, I gotta take a shit. All right, you guys ready? Rakestraw, you and me, we're taking the front. - Bledsoe, Manningham, around the rear. - Copy. Let's take these fuckers down. Hey! Get down, get down, get down, get down! Get down, get down, get down! Get the fuck down! Get the fuck down! Put your fucking hands in the fucking air! Shots fired, officer down. Officer down. Fuck! Careful. One more step. - Yeah. - Yeah. He had a gun. Not on us. No, wasn't our fault. We were just doing our jobs. Just doing our job. Yeah. Breaking news coming out of Fitzgerald County. Cops performed a drug bust on a suspected meth house earlier today. A small team led by Sergeant Fulbright found the tenants armed and were fired at upon entry. Fulbright and his team returned fire, killing three of the four occupants. One officer was injured, but is in stable condition. Located at 1308 Peach Avenue, officers say the drug was one of several on their list of targets. Sean Whitlock was taken into custody, facing charges of drug possession and assault with a deadly weapon. Sean's brother Kyle Whitlock was among those killed in the gunfight. Sources say they lived in a two-family home, sharing it with the other two suspects killed on sight. An investigation is ongoing. Ronald Whitlock? - Maybe. - I'm not sure if you heard, but there's been an incident. Is there a problem, sir? What kind of question is that, son? There's no need for the attitude. Cops killed them. A bit more complicated than that. It's crystal clear to me. I think both of you should get the fuck out of here before I... I do something really bad. I got a wife and two kids. So did I. Oh, my head. Ooh my, this is a bad one. Hey, Cal, how much did we drink last night, baby? You didn't get in no fight, you didn't make out with nobody. And we didn't drive. That's a win. Ooh. Oh, this is a bad one, Cal. Oh, come on, man. Fuck it. What's up, Mack? Come on, Tanner. You look like shit. Said the crackhead on the front porch. What the hell you want? Seeing if I could bump a smoke, grab a few bucks. You ever think of getting cleaned up? Yeah. Did you hear the big news? Nah, what? The cops, they arrested the wrong guy, Kyle Whitlock, he's innocent, man. And they killed Sean, dude. Oh, yeah? How you know that? I was there. It's a cover-up. Right. And the aliens are taking over the government. Man, is it cool if I hang out here for a few hours? Thanks, Mack. You got it, Tanner. Right, let's keep moving it. Roll on, roll on. Oh shit. Hey, man. Morning, Mack. Good to see you, man. I heard you tied one on last night. Well, good morning to you too, Decks. Hey, you let me see your badge, man. - Let's get you in here. - All right. There you go. All right, let me see. Okay, now... Oh, shit. Wait a minute. It says your badge is expired today, man. If you're gonna stay on, you're gonna need to go see human resources - and get a new badge. - Oh, come on, Decks. Ah, you can handle that, man. That's how it works. All right. Have a good one. All right, next. Roll on, roll on. Come on, let's go. Here we go. Good morning, Mack. You still here? Oh yeah. Loving every minute of it. Damn, girl, you about to pop. Any minute, I'll tell ya, just over here, having a ball. I'll bet. Hey, Paula. You tell your old man for me, I ain't paying that speeding ticket. All right, Mack, I'ma tell him. No, no, for real. Asshole. Oh, come on. - Well. - Yeah. Come on, let's go. Keep it moving, keep it moving. This is not your first rodeo. There we go. There we... Holy shit. Look who it is. M-A-C-K Karr, Mr. Touchdown. What up, baby? You know, last night, you were ranting and raving about how you're about to light up for the territories. I know what I said, Blaylock. I was there, damn it. Just... - you know, had a change of heart. - Change of heart? - Since when? Since last night? - Oh. Ha-ha! Come on, let's go, keep it moving. This ain't your first rodeo, there we go. I did not think I'd see your ass in work today. You were saddled up with me at the bar last night. And I only remember drinking beer. Oh no, brother, we went hard after that. I didn't know any better, I'd think somebody slipped me a Mickey. Why don't you take the day off? Go home. Oh come on, Boone. We're cut from tougher cloth than that. Rangers lead the way, brother. All the way, baby. - Security. - Hey, Skip. Cranbrook. Fitzgerald Hydroelectric. Cranbrook, how is it looking, man? Good, really good. Except one small school bus coming in. That's about it. All right, I got eyes on you, man. Great. Appreciate you. Uh, look at that. Bummed me with a pair of twos. What'd you get, Cranbrook? Goddamn. - Howdy, Mack. - Oh hey. What they got you on today? Well, they got me over at Floodgate 8. Did you hear back from UGA? - No. Guess I'm just gonna have to keep welding by day. - Hey, Amy. Did you hear back from GT? - I'll see you around, Mack. - Yeah. I don't know why she does me like that. Well, GT is Georgia Tech. So, Amy's hoping for Georgia Bulldog Graduate School. I heard you made a scene last night at the juke joint. A scene? Moi? No. Hollering about leaving. Mack, you've only been back for a month. - Did you get the box I sent? - Yeah. I mean, did you have to send all the pictures, Soph, I mean? You know, didn't you at least wanna keep a couple? I kept one or two. Just in case you don't come back from one of those trips you take with your old Special Forces buddies? Well, we all can't be silver-spoon-up-the-ass, corporate types like Smith, now can we? - Mack, don't start. - Now I get it. - So if I had learned just a little bit less than you... - Okay, stop. - About running this place... - Mack, stop. No, no, and gone head to head with you for the position of plant director, and beat you out... then we'd be together. - Is that what you're telling me? - No. If you had just stopped being a dick, then we'd be together. - Oh. - But we both know that's not gonna happen, now do we? I'm so much more qualified to run this place than him and you know it. You left me, remember? Is there a problem here? No. No, we all good. Who ate your breakfast, Cranbrook? Come on, now. Have a great day. See you later. Come on, hi. Okay, welcome to Fitzgerald Hydroelectric. Raise your hand if you've ever been inside a dam? Okay. Who's ready? Yeah. - Hey, you got this, 'cause I got to hit the john? - Right on time. Hey, you gotta keep it regular, right? Shit. Base, this is Checkpoint Alpha. We got anybody else coming in today? Hello, Base? Are you there? Base, do you copy? Hello? Hello? What the hell? Base? Tried to get you to join the team, Jared. Boone's on line. Wait, you... Ah! - What the hell is going on? - Call Cranbrook. Tell him to put us on a Level Three alert. And tell him to call Homeland Security. This is Smith, get me the NSA immediately. Pick up. Pick up, pick up. Cranbrook, answer, goddamn it. Get up! Get your hands up! Hurry up, move, move! - Move your ass downstairs! - Hurry up! Get your hands up! Get your fucking hands up! Move, move, move. Hey, motherfucker, hands up, hands up! Hands up. Downstairs, get downstairs. - Hey Skip. Cranbrook. - Smith was trying to call us, but his line went dead. - Everything good? - I saw the deactivation, sorry about that. We had one more school bus trickle in that we didn't know about. - Weird, hopefully they aren't in the way too much. - Yeah. Well, holler if you need anything. Yeah, should be back on now. All right, you have a great day. Holy shit. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh no, mm-mmm. I did not sign up for this shit. Especially not for no whack-ass dam, mm-mmm. - Let me see your hands! - Against the wall! - Get your hands up! - Against the wall! Against the wall, hands up! Don't you say a word either. You just stand there and shut up! Let's go, let's go, come on. Against the wall. You wanna tell me what the hell is going on here? You'll find out soon enough. Who's got eyes on Smith? I wanna talk to him. I wanna talk to him right now! Tried to warn you about that last union contract. I got him. It's not personal. This is Smith, the police are on the way. Oh Smith, this is our first disagreement. A few more and it won't be good. Show me Paula. Paula Fulbright. Phone down! Come on, get out, get out. Please, no. Jesus Christ, Boone, what the hell are you doing? She's pregnant and there are kids here today. Your point? You're not as tough as you think. Boo! Two for flinching. Hey, come here. Take this, take this. You, watch her. - Get in here. - Grab her. Get over there, against the wall. Against the wall. Both of 'em. Round 'em up. Including the children. - Move, move, move, move! - Let's go, move it. Move. Come on, let's go. - Hands up. - Hands up. Move! Get 'em down here now! Get 'em down! Get over here. - Get in there! - Get these kids over here right now. Move your ass. I said, move your ass. - Hey! Hey! - Move it! - How could you do this? - What happened wasn't right. - You know that, too. - Were you there? Now's not the time to get smart with me. Get the fuck out of my face. Get these kids over there! - Get over! Move! - Move right now! Get down on your fucking knees! Get on your knees! Now you listen to me. If I see one small move, we're gonna be sending you home in a body bag to your mama and your papa. You hear me? We are not joking! Are you okay? He needs help. Boone, Boone, he needs help. What do you want me to do, huh? - I don't... - Bring me Smith. Roger that. Are you fucking kidding me? You got 'em. It's okay. We're gonna get you help, okay? We're gonna figure this out. Is everyone okay? We're gonna be okay. All right, tough guy, you're up. - Where are you taking me? - Shut the fuck up. Hey, get me! Holliday, Connecticut... Dam teams, check in. Holliday, Connecticut, dam team, check in. Anybody got eyes on Connecticut or Holliday? Move. I said, move your ass. - All employees are now hostages. - Good. I want a head count. Make sure my men are here and accounted for. Make sure we have a perimeter. I don't wanna have any cops here. - Roger that. - All right. Where'd he go? Let's check over here. Anybody see? He's not here. Clear up here. Check the stairway. Got it. Nothing on 'em. Shut up, shut up. Shut the fuck up. Sorry, brother. Whoa, whoa, don't shoot, it's me. Blaylock. What the hell are you doing in the damn bathroom, man? I don't know, I was in here doing my business. I heard gun shots, so I popped my head out. And I'm seeing soldiers pushing people around. Some security guard you are. They got guns. You got a goddamn gun. Yeah, but they got better guns. - Did you call it in? - Got no signal. Shit. They must have jammed it. I mean, what the hell do these guys want anyway? How the hell am I supposed to know? Fuck! I didn't sign up for this shit. What are we gonna do? Aren't you like ex-military or something? And then some. Come on. Hey, Cranbrook, where you at? Just chilling at Starbucks, you want something? Where the fuck you think I'm at? Where's the welder? Welder? Yeah, fucking Mack Karr, where's he at? I know what's going on, you fucked up. Mack Karr's not supposed to be here today, idiot. You look at those fancy screens in front of you? I ain't seeing shit, Gator. Fuck, waste of time. I'm going to the dam. This is useless. - We got kids here today? - Yeah. - How many? - I don't know, about 20. Shit. Sophia with them? I believe so. What is it? Money? We can work something out. - Listen, my family... - I know about your family. I don't want your damn money. You're an entitled little prick, like a... an annoying rich kid. You think soldiers are free? I got plenty of money. And I'll spend all of it. That's who the fuck I am. All right. So all this is about you fighting the system? That's right. Something you know nothing about. Enter your override code. Excuse me? You heard what the fuck I said. Enter your code. And what if I don't? If you don't enter your code, I'll make a small gesture with my finger like this. And then you'll have a nice little bullet rattling around in your fucking skull. Get the fuck over there. Do it. There's a good boy. Now, pull up the floodgate override. I strongly advise that we don't do that. - Open Gate 3. - That will cause flooding. The water level will raise too much. Please don't make me do that. Did it sound like I was asking you? Listen. There are 100,000 people that live in this county. Families, homes, businesses, they will all get destroyed. Do you understand people will die? Good. This is my legacy. Your legacy? - You're a fucking crazy man. - Thank you. You should try a little bit of crazy. I'll flood this whole place. See now, I told you, two for flinching. Now, open the fucking gate. Operations. Yeah, this is Smith, 4-7-6. Open Gate 3. I just caused a lot of damage. That's right. Your daddy could have billions more... it still wouldn't help. I would flood this whole fucking town. Everyone would drown, even me. You're a sick man. Yeah, we'll talk about that later. Will we? Oh, I already mentioned that. Roll the camera. I want all of 'em to see me. Here we go. Live from Bumfuck, Georgia. All right, everybody. I hope you're settled in. If all goes well, the floodgates will be closed. However... if things don't go to my... my satisfaction, it's gonna be Hurricane Katrina all over again. But this time, here in South Georgia. Let's get on with it. Ms. Fulbright. Where you at, Cankles? All right. Let's go, Paula. No. No! Package is en route. Outstanding. Three of ours are KIA. Two workers are unaccounted for. What did you do? You recruit pussies? Mack Karr, Army Ranger. - Is it real? - Yeah. Working at a fucking dam? I'm just now hearing about this guy? Why don't you ask your inside man? He won't be a problem. He's already a problem. Yeah, he wasn't in my sector. - Kiss my Cuban ass. - Shut up. Yeah, you sissies wanna fight in a playground? Fine, find him. Right now. Roger that. Hey. What's with you and Mack Karr? There's nothing with me and Mack Karr. What are you guys, butt buddies or something? Whatever Ron's paying you, it's too much. Fucker. Do you know who I am? No? I don't know you at all. You're just collateral damage. Boys, let's get her a phone. An outside line and a box of tissues. She's gonna need it. All available sentries move to the junkyard, now. Move, move, move. Move it. - Come on, let's go. - Move! You should have seen my wife when she was pregnant. She was nearly bedridden. No way, she couldn't have handled this. Boy or girl? It's a girl. Congratulations. Watch the sniper. Come on, Blaylock! Come on, Blaylock, take cover. Where now? There's a boat, there's a boat. Mack! Sniper on the roof! - Untie the fucking boat! - Yeah, I'm trying, just give me cover! Why don't we go to the other side and just get help? We leave now, them kids' chances go from slim to none. Just breathe, just breathe, okay? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? What is this, show and tell? Get the fuck back! You want me to show you what a bullet can do to a human body? Huh? He's dying, Boone. We need to call an ambulance. That can't happen, not yet. Can I get someone from the medical team down to the cafeteria immediately? You disgust me. They got off the dock at the other facility. Move in. Got it, I'm on it. You got a name? Either Lynn or Laura. Laura. Oh, that's beautiful. It was my sister's name, she passed away. I'm... I'm very sorry. Natural causes? It was a drunk driver. Hit and run outside Austin. Shit. That's terrible. Did they get the guy? It was a she. And yeah, she's up for parole in five years. Stings, doesn't it? Sorry. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to call your husband. You tell him exactly what I say. - Hey, babe. - Hey. I need you just to stop by the dam real quick - when you get a chance. - Yeah? Um, yeah, yeah, I guess I can swing there. Everything all right? - We've gotten some calls about the water levels rising. - Yeah. - Everything's fine. - All right, sweetie. - I'll see you soon, okay? - Okay, see you soon. Hey, chief. I'm gonna head up to the dam, take my wife something. All right, be careful. Call you if I need you. Copy that. I appreciate that, Paula. Do you have, uh, a preschool? Well, you gotta get on that. All right, gentlemen, what's the latest on the welder? Take that ladder. Come on. - Come on, man. - Yeah, man, I'm trying. Mack! Where are you, you annoying bastard? Shit. Fuck that. Hey, you go up there, he's gonna pick us up one by one. Hey, Mack Karr! You hear me, you son of a bitch? How about you, Tommy Blaylock? I'm gonna fucking kill you. Hold your fire. Let's move. Gator, boss wants an update. He's not my boss, he's my client. Do you have eyes on Mack? He's idle on the plant. We go up there, we're sitting ducks. Then I suggest you find alternative access, hoss. That guy. Gator, Fulbright's approaching the gate. Don't let the welder move. I'm gonna take care of the cop. One cop? They sent only one cop? You gotta be shitting me. And it's Fulbright? That son of a bitch gave me a speeding ticket last week. Bet he's in on it. This is Red Five, got a present for you Alpha. What was that? I'm just a security guard. Hey, hey, hey. - You're not just a security guard, man. - I'm not? - No, Blaylock, you're the fucking man. - I am? That's right. And that's why you're gonna take this walkie-talkie and you're gonna go and you're gonna get that bus, and you're gonna take the bus, and you're gonna go to the front entrance, and you're gonna get them kids out of here. - By myself? - That's right. - Why? - Because I'm the man? Because you're the fucking man. And when you get there, you're gonna go to channel five and you're gonna call me till you get me. - You're the fucking man. - I'm the man. I'm the motherfucking man. Hey, hey, hey, what the hell's going on? Remember me? Gator. Oh! - Ah, fuck. - Let's go, buddy. Get off me, get off me. Gun! - Get the gun! - Get the gun! Take him. Talk to me, Red Five. - Got Fulbright. - Outstanding. Bring his sorry ass here. The main computer room. And hurry up. I got a bone to pick with him. Um, sorry, kids. Mack, you scared the shit out of them. I'm kind of winging it here, Soph. So, got your little fucking piggy over here. Come here, sit down. Fucking piece of shit cop. Fuck. What is this? You're a fugitive, you killed two cops. Yeah, hard to change it. We have that in common. What the fuck are you talking about? You remember my son? You do, don't you? You remember Kyle Whitlock? How about Sean? You remember him? It was an accident. You motherfucker. Oh shit. You motherfucker, you're gonna fucking fry. You want anymore? Do you want it? Well, get the fuck up. - Fuck you. - No. He lied once. Don't do it again. Tell me, what really happened on July 25th? Tell me! Go, go, go! - Hey, hey, hey! - Get the fuck down! These are kids. These aren't our guys. Put your fucking hands in the air! - Hear that? - What is that? It's a fucking duplex. It's the wrong fucking place, man. - Wrong fucking address. - Fuck. All right, come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. I want you to say his name. Say his name! Kyle. Kyle Whitlock. That's right. - Kyle Whitlock. - He had a... He had a gun. He had a gun to protect himself. You fucked everything up. Everything. Piece of shit. Hey, you listen. Hey, hey, you listen to me. You can hurt me. But if you touch her, I swear to God, I will go to my grave with my thumbs in your eyes. You're not in a position to fucking say anything. Don't... Don't, please. I got a baby. I got a baby coming. Please, I got a little girl. No. Change your ways. You change your fucking ways or I'm putting the right one in your head. Tell me what I want to hear! Okay, fine. I'm sorry, that what you want to hear? Hey, I can get you a plane, all right? I can get you a plane, I can get you out of here. I can get you money, I can get you whatever you need. What do you want? Is that what it is? Sorry. Yes, I'm sure you are. Everybody's sorry. He was a good boy. And you took him away. You killed one son. And you locked the other one up. - Don't. - No! No! Move her out of the way. I'm not done yet. You... You're a monster! No! No! No! No! Feed him to the gators. Rogue hostage? Last I heard he was cornered at the top of the plant. Good, good job. You have to know he's lost it, right? I mean, is this going the way you thought it would? The way that he said it would? I think he told you one thing. I think he told you to come in, guns a-blazing, get some revenge, get paid, but that only the bad people would get hurt. Does that sound about right? Shut up. It's not going that way, is it? I said, shut up. Did you know that years after Katrina, there are families that are still trying to get back on their feet. I know what it means. I know what it means. Oh man. It's just too dangerous. Did you just see what I just saw? This guy's out of his mind. There's no telling how many people he's gonna kill. Moving them is a risk. Staying here is a risk. Now, I can get them kids on the bus and get 'em out of here. Who's gonna drive the bus? Fuck. I really need to use the bathroom. - Listen, no. - Hey, hey, hey. Now go. Shut up and don't move! Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. Ah, my nose. Who's the man? Yeah, who's the man? I'm the motherfucking man, baby. Y'all good? Everybody okay? Let's go, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hurry up, get in the bus. Let's go, let's go! Come on, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Let's go, here we go. - Yes! - Let's go. All the way to the back. Here we go. Get on the bus, here we go. I'll be damned. Here we go. Hey, yo, Mack, this is Blaylock. I'm on the move, heading over there now. Uh, kids, gentlemen. What I need you to do is, I need you to get up. So I need everyone to stand up, come on. Boone, both hostage teams aren't checking in and Mack can't be found on the plant. Shit. Watch him. It's okay, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go, let's go, come on. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on, get out. Oh, come on. Get this over with. Oh, fuck. Stop right there. You know the drill. Move. Move! Fuck, Mack! You. You, Boone? You're a part of all this shit? You weren't supposed to be here. Oh, that's right. That's right, the bar last night. I should have known something was wrong the minute you said you was buying. Come on, tell me. Why? They killed his fucking kid, Mack. What, they killed his kid, so you're gonna blow a dam and kill 100,000 people? It wasn't supposed to go down like that! Well, how the fuck was it supposed to go down? You took a fucking oath to protect this country against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Against who? People like you. Oh, brother. Do the right thing, man. Not a good look. No, no, no, Sophia, you're supposed to be on the bus. Now what are you doing here? I ain't gonna leave you. That was not part of the plan. And you're supposed to be with Blaylock. You're supposed to be safe. - Okay, so now what? - I don't know. I know. The security hub, maybe Cranbrook's not with them. Let's go. Killing that cop didn't feel as good as you thought, did it? We gotta end this, Ron. We got passports, new names. We can get the hell out, call this a wash. That cop looked at me square in the eyes and he lied. How do you know that? I thought you were with us the whole time. Never figured you for a fucking psycho. Come on, man. And I... need your strength... and how you're gonna help me, and how you're gonna fucking help me bring along... - You're going to fucking help, all right? - Listen... Listen, we go a way back, okay? Yeah, damn straight. And you know, I'd do anything for you. Anything in the world. But I didn't think you'd escalate this shit to this degree. I mean, come on, man. Take the L. He didn't know they were cops. How do you know that? What if your son was the one that lied? And what if the cops did identify themselves? And what if he shot first? He didn't shoot first. How do you know? 'Cause I know my son. Well, to prove it, it doesn't mean you have to kill every motherfucker swinging dick that had something to do with it, does it? Answer me this. Did we find who was related to Larry Rakestraw? Amy Rakestraw. Listen, apple pie. Why? You like 'em feisty or some bullshit like that? Yeah, something like that. - Cranbrook? - Mack. Quite a mood this morning, brother. Don't tell me you in on all this shit. Come on, Mack. You know me better than that, but... This town's gone crazy. I played football in high school with this guy. - You okay? - Yeah. He always gave me the heebie-jeebies. Open another gate, now. If you're coming out of Cherokee County, stay at home. Reports are coming in the hydroelectric dam is not able to keep the gates working. Sit. So I assume you know why we're here. And here I was thinking you had good intel. Detective Rakestraw. You're not related to him? Unfortunately, that feckless piece of shit is my brother. Stepbrother. So my intel was spot on. But if you think that no account son of a bitch is gonna come running down here just 'cause I call him, your intel's for shit, hoss. Is that right? He's a low-life, dirty cop. Shit, he's probably worse than Fulbright. Fulbright, he was just roped in on this whole damn thing. He's nothing but a follower. He's just loyal to a fault. I got that feeling. Most people in this town think it was bullshit what happened to Kyle. Kid, he stayed to himself, never bothered anyone. Went to school. I didn't know him. But... But he seemed like a real good kid. But there are better ways to get justice than this. I wish that were true. I live in the real world. Which is why you should know just as good as anybody that bad, god-awful shit happens to good people all the damn time. But the difference between you and them is that you think the answer to the fact is to just wash it all away. I like you, Amy. I hate to have to kill you. Call the detective now. I bet you a million bucks I ain't got, this dickhead don't answer. Did you cut it off or cut it back on? Well, how long did you leave it off? Well, sweetie... Look, I think we reached the apex to my knowledge of the subject of your Wi-Fi. No, I know we have. I gotta go, I gotta go. Babe, we'll look at it when I get home. Well, howdy, officers. I don't have my driving license, but I got a bus here of kids that need some help now. Jesus Christ. Again. Get an ambulance for the driver. - Call these kids' parents. - Let's go! Calm down, we got you, calm down. Calm down? I just told you there's a bus full of kids. I'm pretty sure I know why you're calling. Do you have the phone? Yeah, and you need to come alone. Amy, hey, Amy. Hang up the the phone 'cause we need help! He's on his way. Outstanding. Mack Karr! Drop the gun. You must be Gator. Yeah, I bet you're a big Florida fan. No. Bulldogs. No shit, me too. Yeah, I've been waiting for this. I'm gonna get you Mack Karr. NSA Security, this is Skip. - Skip, Officer Bledsoe, Fitzgerald Chief of Police. - Okay. We met at that mixer thing at the Civic Center, where you all walked us through the... Oh yeah, it wasn't really a mixer. It was more of a safety protocol seminar, but... Yeah, well I just want to let you know that your safety protocols are for shit, hoss. Excuse me? Copy that. Hey. Easy there, Eastwood. - Did you get him? - No. Bunch of assholes out there trying to interfere with me. Check it out. Rakestraw. What the hell is going on? Why are these cops showing up one by one? First Fulbright, now him. I'm sure Blaylock drove straight to the police station. Right, right, so if the police know... - NSA knows. - So where the hell are they? They sure are taking their sweet-ass time getting here. I gotta figure out a way to get in that control room and stop this fool. - I'll be back. - I'm coming with you. Oh no, you're not. Mack, I can help you shut the dam down. Sophia, no, you are not. You're a detective now? Your sister confirmed what I already know. I bet she did. We're in agreement. You are the sorriest sack of shit in the whole damn county. You wouldn't have the whole truth if it bit you on the ass. Let's just say I beg to differ. Sorry to keep everybody waiting. Ron Whitlock, former head of security, Fitzgerald Hydroelectric. And from what I can tell, there's a rogue hostage with some sort of military background who has helped us to free the kids. Or else the whole dam might already be under water. It is my high recommendation we make this a full-scale military operation. We get in, secure the facility, and get out. Is that understood? Then let's make this happen. I'm a cop. Don't fucking shoot me. They're gonna fucking kill you, man. Where are they? Get to the manual overdrive. Go, go, go. Let me guess, Gator. You mama name you that or come up with it on your own? Well, why don't you come out here and find out? I'm out of ammo. Mano a mano. Hand to hand, man to man? You got it. Motherfucker. Sorry, dude, got a town to save. I'm hearing chatter. What kind of chatter? My guess is the NSA's been mobilized. We gotta go. Like hell. Listen, man, we tried, this is over. We... We can't. You don't fucking do anything unless I'm fucking talking about that. Do you understand that? I'm calling the shots. Me, that's it, that's it. I don't wanna have any problems from you. Let's just wash the whole thing away. Smith, open another gate. Hey! Now! Think about what you're doing. I mean, do you even care that you are gonna completely destroy an entire county? Just shut up. This is not gonna end well for you. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself. That is beautiful. You just want to see this whole place wash away, right? We're all gonna drown, Jesus! Boone, we gotta go. We can't leave these people. We can and we will. - You gotta close the gate. - I can't let that happen. Close the fucking gate! I only wanted one cop to admit that they fucked up. And they can't do it. They'd rather destroy their town than clear my son's name. Well, now you've killed them all, so it's on you. I'll bear that burden. It's what makes me different. I'll own it! Get him out of here. Now... Now y'all pissing me off. Oh, man, I hate this thing. Team, deploy. Move, move, move! Deploy west, B Team. Move, move! Go, go! Move to side entrance, go, go. It's over, Ron. You make a move, slim, the boss gets it. - The rogue hostage? - That's me. Rogue hostage, rogue welder, rogue just about everything. - You look it. - Thanks. I read your file, I served also. Yeah, no shit. Kind of figured that part out on my own, man. I thought all this meant something. Move your ass! You'll kill everybody, you know. Even if you can control the flood. Yeah, I know. I read your story, man. I know what's got you all riled up. - Don't start with the bullshit. - No, no, no, I'm not. A friend of mine was there that day who saw what really happened with your son. He says he's innocent, man. Bullshit. I swear it, soldier to soldier. Come on, man. Fucking come on, Ron. Call 'em off, man. Where is this guy you were talking about? I know where to find him. And I promise you, if you call off your men, I will make sure that his story gets out there. I heard that before too. Fuck! Come on, come on. Come on. Fuck. Fuck! You need to close them fucking gates right now. Gates stay open. Tell that bitch to stop trying or Smith will be next. Shit. Sophia, listen to me, do not close the gates. They are going to kill me. Take your hands off the wheel, do you understand? Are you serious? They're gonna flood the entire county. No, we have to close the gates. Are you serious? Asshole! Ugh! Hands up, the power's being shut down. Close the fucking gates! Put your guns down! Don't shoot! Surrender, surrender. No, don't shoot. Don't shoot, Ron. Tell your men to put the gun down. Come on, man. Ron. This is no way to go out. Come on, man, put the gun down. Put the gun down, it's over. Come on, man. This is no way to go out. It's over. Just make sure that my son gets out. Soldier to soldier, okay? As Fitzgerald County tries to heal after last week's dam hijacking, all eyes turn towards the wrongful death case that sources say caused the incident. Following new eyewitness testimony, Sean Whitlock has been released and cleared of all charges. But he was back in court today, as his brother's case is heard. Prosecutors hope for a swift end to the case as the community will be feeling the effects of that fateful raid for some time. Whoa, look who it is, Mack Karr. Chief of security now. Man, shut up, Blaylock. - My man. - No, no, no, the man. - That's right, baby. - That's what I'm talking about. Trevor, must be struggling, brother, here we go. Come on now, Trevor. I love you. You do? Wow, that's nice. Hey, Calvin. Come. Come on, baby. Calvin. - Calvin. - Calvin, come on, baby. Come on, baby, come on. Hey, you. Come on, Calvin, up, up, up. - Oh, there we go. - Yeah. So cute.
