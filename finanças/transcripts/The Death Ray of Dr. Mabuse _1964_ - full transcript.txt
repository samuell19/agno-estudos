Yes, sir. I'm on my way. No massage today. You have a visitor. Won't be long, major. I'll let Professor Pohland come up for you from hydrotherapy. For a man who terrorized all of England, he does get off lightly, - don't you think? - Yes, though he claims to be innocent. Secret service has been informed. The professor puts all the blame on Dr. Mabuse, whose evil spirit gained possession of professor Pohland's mind. The professor is hallucinating. That's why he's here. And I am here because Pohland's madness is methodical. His brain must function like an archive, in which fragments of Mabuse's testament can still be found. That's why we study him again and again. Good morning, professor. This gentleman wants to speak with you. It wasn't me. It was Mabuse. He used my brain. It's always the same. Typical symptom of paranoia. A record on which the needle cannot leave the groove. - Let's give the needle a... bump. - Well we can try. Bring the professor to electrotherapy. What do you expect from this experiment, Major? Assuming Mabuse really has the power to control another person's brain, his ideas and plans would somehow be burned into the professor's subconscious, understand? Now turn off the light. Through the precisely calibrated application of an electric shock, one could detach the thoughts of Mabuse, now hidden in the subconscious, and direct them into the professor's consciousness. We need to increase the current a little. Say something! Anything! No matter what. The first thing that comes to mind. Dea... th Ra... ys Major! Where is he? - Hello major. - Good morning, sir. Good morning. We've got a new assignment for you. - And where does it lead me this time? - Malta. Come on. Here on the Southern coast, there's a small town: Belmar. A dead frogman was washed ashore there. He's already the fourth in the last 14 days. The unusual activity of the sardine boats is striking. And there's only one explanation: espionage. - Spies are after the bigger fish. - Exactly. In this case, the big fish is a certain professor Larsen, who uses his island to conduct experiments with his newest invention. A thing that will shake the world. Strange that this happens after the disappearance of professor Pohland, custodian of Mabuse's testament. - He was abducted in the middle of a sentence. - What did he say? - Only one word: Death rays. - Death rays? That's exactly what professor Larsen's working on. I don't like this at all. Get on the way and get in touch with admiral Quency. Quency? I thought he resigned. No way. It was a sham so he could take over marine defense in the Mediterranean. - Do you know him? - I served under him in Norway. - Okay, I'll take the next flight. - Excellent. - The safest cover will be a couple in love. - Yes sir, the cov... Could you repeat that? Well, in a small town like Belmar you alone would be too conspicuous, and so I hope you'll spend hopefully happy holidays with your girl there. - So I'd have to take one with me? - Any objections? Why? I love girls in due time, but not when on duty. I fear you'll have to make this sacrifice for England. - This is an order, by the way. - Yeah, I'll do it for England. Margaret, Anne, Christine... No, no, no. Dolly... Judy! I feel like I'm in heaven. I'm so happy I could die right now. You are still needed, baby. - Ah, Greece! Where is Kolopetinita? - Kolopeti... what? - Kolopetinita, where I was born. - Ah, but we are up here. Directly over Malta. You see? I'm dying with excitement. I still can't believe it. - Just one more question darling. - Yes, darling. - How do they do it on Malta? - "Do it"? With getting married. In a church or at the register office? - Let's talk about getting married after the honeymoon, OK? - Oh, uhm... I wouldn't want them to drive like that when it's my time. You don't have any last wishes on your last ride. Kaspar? This corpse is at your service. Coming by air cargo from London. So you escaped them once again. The English police force isn't all it's cracked up to be. - Those goddamn idiots. - How was your trip? Not too bad. It's a coffin with all extras. Air holes and a rubber mattress. And where is the corpse for the funeral? In the ice box, for three days. Of course I want to meet the man who is gonna take my place in the cold grave. A fisherman. He was a little bit too nosy. - You know the boss doesn't like it. - The boss! I have to make my report! Step more into the light! Identify yourself! Kaspar Acondas, pass number 17, reporting back. Did you get here without any problems? Yes, boss. Airfreight as a corpse on the same flight as Major Anders. Yes, I know. He is with a woman. They are staying at the "Maltese Cross" room number 26. I understand, boss. l will get rid of him as soon as possible. - You won't do anything without my order. - Yes, boss. For now we still need him alive. You will wait at the harbour on boat number 13. Yes, boss. Boat number 13. - Darling... - Oh, this is exciting. I'm here... - seventeen, eighteen, nineteen... - What are you counting? - Sardine boats. - What's so exciting about them? More than you can imagine. Sails, wind, round and beautiful. Huh, I could offer you something round as well. Even without binoculars. Oh what a bed. What a wonderful bed. I hope it's enough. - Bob? - Yes? Something is wrong with you. You didn't take me with you just to look at sardine boats? - I'm sorry but I have a terrible headache. - But where are you going to? - The pharmacy. - l have some Aspirin. I need something stronger than that. I'll be right back. Oh no, first the sardine boats and now the headache. - Yes, please? - Please, I have this prescription here... - Commander Adams is expecting you, Sir. - Thank you. In the name of the boss I welcome you Major. - Good Afternoon. But I was expecting... - Yes, I know. Admiral Quency. He had to leave on a short notice. "Operation Archimedes" is in jeopardy. "Operation Archimedes"? Our code name for Professor Larsen's experiment. His invention is based on the burning mirror of Archimedes which he used to set the Roman fleet on fire. - A proved and tested method, right. - Yes, that's right. But his method is new. You will see it for yourself when you are on the projection island. - Such an island isn't on any of the maps. - That is Professor Larsen's description. That's what he calls it because he wants to send his death rays into space from there. - A boat of the Malta Canning Company. - Who is the owner? Mario Monta. Or let's say him and his older brother. He is a friend of Gilda. The niece of Professor Larsen? The ruler of the fishing fleet and the niece of the Professor. A strange combination, don't you think? He also seems to be a frogman. There is some diving equipment right here. If you keep on searching you will find mine, too. Hello Commander Adams. The fear of all spies. - I wish it were true. - What a charming backup. - How should I take that? - May I introduce Gilda Larsen to you. - It's my pleasure. - Thank you. You guys from the secret service are still the most charming. - How do you know that? - I'm my uncle's secretary. - We were notified by London. - You aren't about to leave? I'm sorry but Mario and l have been invited out this evening. - Hello Major Anders, there you are. - In the flesh. You are staying at the "Maltese Cross". Beautiful hotel. - Very much. - We hope to meet your charming company as well. - Oh, well. - There are no secrets in Belmar, this is a little town. - That's good for the secret service. - Gilda, your uncle is expecting us. - Yes. I hope you will like it here. - Oh, I can't complain. Should you find something suspicious you can just talk to me. It's getting late. We have to go. Why didn't you bring me here in a spotlight? - Isn't she a beautiful girl? - So what. After all she is part of your mission. - Uhm, may we come inside, Professor? - You are already inside. l'm uhm... may I introduce our new special agent? Major Anders. - Did he at least bring me some money? - No. He is here to protect you. Huh, another guy who thinks he is important. I am Dr. Krishna. The assistant of Professor Larsen. - Good evening doctor. - Uhm, if I move this way... You are an old fox. - If the British government subsidises your project... - They don't! - or if you are just being financed privately... - Luckily I am. You are on British territory and are subject to our... My own precautions are more than enough. Thank you Major. Excuse me, but that is for us to decide. As a specialist in hypnosis and telepathy I'm asking you. How many moves to the checkmate? I would have to read your mind to win. Without it I don't have a chance. Let's show the Major the laboratory. Although I doubt he will understand anything about it. - Too charming, Professor. - I always am. - This way, please gentlemen. That's the elevator. - Below sea level. - Precautionary measures Major Don't touch anything! This door here leads to the steel vault. Please wait here. I don't like people looking over my shoulder. Close the door. No-one knows the combination apart from him. - Not even you? - No-one And the lock is made in such a way, that the slightest manipulation from someone unauthorized, triggers the mirror destruction automatically. Destruction? There is no way out if someone works the device wrong. You can come in now gentlemen So this is the home of "Operation Archimedes". Yeah, it looks like science fiction, doesn't it? I hope the concept of science fiction makes it easier for you to understand my invention but. . Here we are 50m under the surface of the earth. With help of this periscope axis, the mirror ascends over the water. Now without a doubt this is a very important computer. It steers round the device and focuses electronically on the target area. Bonn, Berlin, London, New York, Moscow... I set the fire-point of the mirror on any place-light that I like. The targeted city would burn in fractions of a second. I'd say you need approximately 7 days to destroy the whole world. With all the respect professor, this is the device of the Devil. You are right Commander. Whoever controls this weapon can conquer the world. That's exactly what I just thought. You really thought about everything doctor. Do you have a 6th sense? It's only matter of training. And how much time does someone need for this... training? Five, six... thousand years. Our detection device... The oscillograph gives information about everything that sails in the sea. From the amplitude I can recognize the type of the ship. A 6 cylinder diesel, one of the sardine boats is looking for you. It must be here. The navigation's entry point. The projection island must be one sail mile to the west. - There's a light over there. - Professor Larsen's house. He just visited the Professor. So we can start now. Troop three get ready! Destination shark cliffs. Wait in the grotto for further instructions, and report any movements on the Projection Island. Now full speed ahead. The Boss is expecting us at Midnight... Judy, Judy... Oh darling, you're finally here. How silly, why do you lie under the bed? I was afraid being all alone on it. - What's that you said darling? - Nothing... I had an awful nightmare, that's why I was afraid. - What did you dream of? - A frog, there! A frog? - Bob. It was only a dream. - Maybe it was one, maybe it wasn't. Ok, the frog is gone. Get into bed! What's with the revolver? I'll just do it. Troop 4 ready for orders. Troop 3 is waiting for further instructions about the sharks. Good. Everyone will wait for their signal for the attack on the projection island. Meanwhile I will secure the inside access to the death mirror for us. through Professor Larsen's brain. I know how it works because I'm playing chess with him. It is so beautiful here. I don't even care anymore where you were yesterday. - Thank you my darling. - So where were you yesterday? - With you my darling. - Yeah, later. But where were you earlier? Not important. You were the main attraction. Since when are you jealous? No, I'm just practical. You bring me to Malta and then you don't take advantage of me. Don't worry. The company is paying for everything. - Huh, who are you working for? - For a solid old fashioned company. Old fashioned. Yes, one can tell. Go and sit down next to the stairs. I'll take some pictures of you. - Show me what you got! - That's a big lens. Yes, I need depth of field for the background. You should rather focus on my frontal view. I'm hot enough. Oh my God. What was that? - A gunshot. - A what? See, that's what you get when you are out all night. It was probably a jealous husband. There is a pharmacy right around the corner from the hotel. If I'm not back until noon you go and deliver this. Yes, I will do it. There must be a woman behind all of this! - May I help you, sir? - May ask who is living here? - Who are you looking for, Sir? - I want to talk to the owner of the house. What kind of behaviour is this, Ferdinand? You can't let the Major wait outside! - So you live here, Mr. Monta. - Yes, I do. My whole families does. We've been living here for 300 years. Built by Marius Monta, notorious pirate and captain for the Sultan of Tripoli. - He was caught by the Maltese knights and... hung! Wrong. Baptized! Since then we are a boring Christian fishing family that deals with sardines. - And what is up there? - My brother. He's probably counting money right now. Excuse me if I don't come with you. But to be honest, our relationship isn't the best at the moment. Hopefully nothing serious. Huh, it's the old story of the ant and the cricket. He works and I sing. - You'll excuse me. - Sure, I'm sure I'll see you later. Yes, come in. Oh, Major. You've saved me a stamp. An invitation to my birthday party. You are coming, right? Thank you. It will be my pleasure. Don't you want to bring your charming girlfriend? - Her name is Judy, right? - Oh, yes. That's very considerate. - A birthday party is more fun than a funeral. - Funeral? Yes, I had another invitation. It was for my own funeral. Gilda, here is the layout for Professor Larsen's contract. - May I introduce Mr. Monta. This is Major Anders. - My pleasure - British Secret Service, right? - How word travels... - What is the reason for your visit? - I was just looking around. You can see my patio from here, did you know that? - Someone with a good gun and a telescope could... shoot at you? Not just from here. There are big rocks right behind us. The church and the tower. I hope we will see you here more often, Major. But now you have to excuse me please. And don't forget, we are fishermen and not hunters. Glad to hear that Mr. Monta. Well Major, if someone does ever shoot at you, it certainly won't be me. - I'm a peace loving person. - Fine, I'm relieved to hear that. And to prove it... What are you doing tonight? - I'll try to stay alive. - Should you succeed, - come for a drink on the island. - And the uncle? Don't worry about my uncle! He's playing chess. Don't be afraid! He won't hurt you, he's just playful. - I am Fausto Botani. - Botani? You can find me here every day, such a grave makes a lot of work. But I do it with pleasure for my poor Laura. She loved fresh flowers more than anything. Do you have a grave here as well? Not yet, I just wanted to get on the tower. You've chosen a nice day. If you're lucky, you can see the islands. I'm very interested in islands. Would you join me? Oh no, many thanks, there are far too many stairs for me. - Goodbye! - Who should do it? You! He saw me at the clinic in London, that's your job Lazlo. Alright my boy. What now? - Hmm? - The boss! Admiral Quency! Major Anders, Sir, from London! I... l... - Take a seat. - Thank you. You've probably been warned about me, since you don't look at me. No Admiral. - Incidentally, I prefer to be called boss. - Yes, boss. Well, as we gonna see each other every day. Let's get my outer appearance out of the way once and for all. I'm wearing this silly cap because half of my skull is made of metal, and the black patch because I'm missing an eye. I'm using a part of my amputated leg as my left cheek, and that hand is guaranteed stainless steel. But fate is kind Major. For this job only my brain is needed. - Is that enough? - Indeed Admi... uh pardon me, boss. Then we can get started. Now, what do you have to report? So far nothing but failures. My incognito is a complete failure, the whole island knows who I am. Excellent, that's how it was planned. If you fail as the man in the foreground, our opponent is distracted and l have better ways to close in on him. - Who's our opponent? - Professor Larsen. The man we are supposed to protect? That's exactly it, he doesn't want us to protect him. He had an old grudge against England. We refused to fund the project Archimedes. He may never forgive us. Old bullhead. He doesn't want us to get our hands on his invention. But he doesn't want the other one to get it either. - The other, who's that? - The boss of the frogmen. Aha! So you are responsible for the four frogmen that were washed ashore. It's a competition, Major. A swimming competition one could almost say. and the prize is the mirror. In our hands it could be the guarantee of global peace. - On the contrary, - World domination, Dr Mabuse's old dream. Again Mabuse? He seems to be a hobbyhorse of yours, eh? It's all a question of who has the better nerves. Or do you think we should take violent action? That would be pointless. The vault will only open with a special code number. - Yes and only the professor knows it. - He has an assistant, Dr Krishna. If Krishna would know it, he would no longer be the assistant. The number only exists in the memory of the professor. And the memory of the professor is his niece. Perhaps you should strengthen the security measures for these two. Affirmative! I uh am at it. To be exact, tonight. Uh-huh, I know. Sleep well. Thank you, boss. I will. Oh, yes there is my old friend Pluto. - Do you insist on saying hello to my uncle? - Not necessarily. - A man like you surely drinks scotch. - Straight up! Just like me. I don't like anything that is watered-down. Makes life short and dangerous. Ah! Look at this, trophy of victory. Clay pigeon shooting tournament in Monte Carlo. Again you are drawing the conclusion that I could have shot at you. - Believe me, that's impossible. - Why? I never miss. Also, I never shoot at men I like. I need them alive. - Garde la dame. - Check! - I'm afraid. - Of what? That I'll fall in love with you. First | just tried to spy on you a bit, but actually I like it better this way. Please, my dear. You fell as much in love with me, as I fell in love with you. What did you want to find out? - What are you plans with my uncle? - Your uncle? Yes, he's no longer the same, he says the weirdest things, as if he is no longer himself. You must know that better than me, you are his memory after all. That's true, but in your arms I forget everything, darling. What do you want to find out then? The combination for the door to the stone. How should I give it to you. I don't know it and my uncle doesn't know it either. - But that's impossible. - Apparently it changes frequently, he never knows the number in advance. - And who gives him the new one? - I don't know. Agent Anders, I'm afraid you wasted your time with me. I can't supply you with any information. The time wasn't wasted at all. not wasted. l have learned a lot from you. Don't move. There is someone at the window. Major, please. Not like that. You have to get dressed for your routine work. I was a special assignment. Why don't you stay, Major? I didn't fall asleep. - Where is your chess partner? - Mr. Botani is the slave of his dog. Professor, was someone else on the island tonight who doesn't belong here? - Yes. There was someone else. - Who? - You, Major! - Stop it. - There must've been someone else. - Nonsense. No one can set foot on my island without my finding out. - But there was a shadow! - That was my shadow, major! l was down by the footbridge to turn on the light. - We have visitors. - The ant and the cricket. Hello Major. What a remarkable day. - It started with you and it is finishing with you. - Remarkable. You also have the honour to witness the signing of a remarkable contract. - Did you check the contract? - Yes, but not in detail. - I need more time for that. - Time is money, doctor. And death rays are already pretty expensive! What do you want to kill with those death rays, if you don't mind me asking. - Sardines? - Sharks! If they enter our fishing grounds. I'm afraid we are holding the Major up. He has a long way back home. Good night. Good night Professor. Good night. Hands up! I'd love to cut up this fish myself. But for some reason the boss wants him alive. Get out! Look who we have here. The nurse from London. Easy, no fooling around in the coffin. Out now, the boss wants to see you. Get going. Wait here. I welcome you Major Anders. You might have noticed that you are still alive although I had more than one opportunity to get rid of you. I guess you did it out of pure sympathy. - But I have to know everything. - You are talking about my code. Exactly. No matter what the price. You really seem to think that everything has its price. - That whole world can be bought. - My goal is the death mirror. Whoever owns it rules the world. Don't miss your chance, Major. Do you know who I am? - Dr. Mabuse - Then you also know that you're going to talk. 0f your own accord, or... You have 24 hours. Hey, where are you going? Come back. Be a good dog. Now look at that. Wondrous, wondrous, wondrous. Caught in the fishing net of sardine boat number 13. Put in a coffin and brought to a mysterious chapel. Had a chat with a shadow in a confessional, and escaped through a stone baptistery which led directly into the sea. I can't help it, major. Isn't that a little hard to believe? - So where's that chapel. - Somewhere inside the city walls. - Where exactly? - I don't know. And where does the underground passageway lead to? I don't know that either. There's no entrance from the outside, that's for sure. You must admit it's not much. If I were you, I'd visit the Town Museum. - Museum? - A true treasure trove. There's a collection of town maps and construction plans, partly dating back to the foundation. - Alright, I'll have a look. - You do that. But with your kind permission, I'll take a nap first. - Yes, that's an order. You need it. - Yes, sir. Sleep well, major. Above all, no nightmares. Thank you. - Ah, you in a hurry? Why? - I'm going to bed. - Your bed exploded. - Exploded? - A little present for you. Time bomb. - What about Judy? - On vacation. - What? Nothing happened to her. We were warned and could get her out in time. - And where is she now? - She's safe. - Over at audio surveillance B. - And what is audio surveillance B? - A brothel. - What? Well, she does not have to work. It's... like the pharmacy. In the back the secret service, up front the shop. Bring me there. - Where is Judy? - Pity. She must be busy. I didn't bring her to Malta to... I told you she didn't have to work here, but now she's stumbled into the secret service, and she gets deployed according to her talents. - That's the secret signal. - This job can be hell. - Gentlemen, what can I do for you? - My friend insists on seeing Judy. Major Anders! It is an honour. You mean our talented new acquisition. I think she happens to be free at the moment. Follow me, please. Nice you can finally catch some sleep, major. The hero has comeback after his victorious battle. - I'm sorry Judy. I mean it. - How nice to see you again. - It's my fault that you're stuck at this terrible... - What are you talking about. This place is great, I really like it here. - You like it? - Yes. Why not? Definitely better than the prison. They said I knew too much. And that I'd join them or they'd have to take me in protective custody. - So you chose this right here. - You and your dirty mind. Just the bare thought of it is upsetting. I don't have to do it if I don't want to. Well, that's good to know. You've been telling me some lies. That you are working for a respectable company you secretive fellow. As far as I'm concerned, good old England is still a respectable company. And from now on I'm a member of this company. And because we are colleagues now I decided to forgive you. And I thank you for that. After a day like this one can really relax and enjoy the comfort of a warm bed. In an establishment like this. - Don't worry, you don't have to pay for it. - Oh, thank you. - Come in. - Good morning. You have been recommended to me. Major Anders from the British Secret Service. Oh, of course. Why should you be the only person who doesn't know who I am. Shall I give you some other important information as well? Hat size 59, collar size 42, height 1, 86 meter, shoe size... - Are you single? - Yes. I'm glad to hear that. - The director is waiting for you. - Thank you. - Mr. Botani. - Pluto, quiet. Major Anders. Good to see you again. - You are the director of the city museum. - As you can see. - Please, take a seat. - Thank you. - You probably know why I'm here. - Yes, your boss informed me. If I remember correctly you are looking for a walled chapel, right? Yes, and it has a secret corridor from the baptistery to a grotto right by the sea. There are many grottos on our coast. They are former hiding places of the pirates. As historian and archaeologist I spent a lot of time studying old building plans and old maps. - So you can help me then. - I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. There are no records for what you are looking for. But the chapel exists. I was there. That's strange. There is nothing in the maps. Can you read Latin? Usually I don't but I might be able to translate it. Then I might be able to help you. Mercedes. Yes. My dear, please be so kind and bring me the chronicles of the arch bishop's from the vault. - But... it was sold. - Sold? Yes. To help us through the financial hardships of the museum. Back when you were on your trip around the world. - But how could you... - But you know this. You sent us a telegram with your approval. Oh, right. Now I remember. Yes, yes my memory. I better leave you with Mercedes, she knows all the books. Please. Please follow me, Major. - Let's see what I can do for you. - Yes. Thank you. Relax, Pluto. Mr. Botani hasn't been the same since his wife died. Who bought the book? - A rich man who could afford it. - Obviously. Who was the lucky guy? - I'm sure you know him. - Who is it? - Mario Monta. - Oh, that's interesting. A cricket who reads books in Latin. My guess would've been the ant, Jason. Jason wanted it first but Mario took right in front of his eyes just to annoy him. - They don't get along too well. - How do you know all this? This is a small town. We live for the gossip. Life is so terribly boring here. Especially at night. - So, when? - 9:00 PM. Africa Terrace 32. - Hello. - Hello. Please come in. I've been eagerly waiting for you. How nice of you. Very nice. I can be much nicer. - And you type just as well. - Not nearly as well as this. Who could. Hm, expensive perfume. A charming dress. This is all I'm wearing. - Turn on the music. - Sure. - Let's drink to... - A long life. Why not. A long life! Just to be completely on the safe side. - A long life! - Are you always this cautious? - Only with women. - So many bad experiences? But I agree. There are women and women. I will show you the difference. Darling, hold me tight. It's pretty difficult to get rid of a body. Especially when it's still alive. Because luckily I'm wearing a bullet proof vest. And now we're gonna talk about things my way. I won't say a thing. You do it for money, huh. Who is paying you? Let me go. It's bad manners to kill people. I gonna punch your yellow face green and blue. Who is paying you? Who? - The boss. - Who is the boss? He is behind you. I'm not deaf. What's the matter? Oh, excuse me Major Anders. - I'd like to speak to the Admiral. - I'm sorry, he isn't here. - Do you know where he is? - No. I'm sorry. I don't know. But I have to talk to him. It's very important. The boss is never available but if he wants' to get hold of someone he will be in touch. Good night. Oh, Bob you are back. Finally a real man. I feel like I'm in a cloister. And who is this? The snoring thing in your bed is the mother superior? He suddenly walked through the door. Totally drunk. I didn't like him so I gave him some sleeping pills. - You should've heard him talking in his sleep. - What did he say? I didn't pay attention. Pay attention then, it could be something interesting! - Something about Gilda's birthday. - Gilda. And fireworks going off and some other nonsense. Nonsense. Nonsense you say. Judy you've found out when they will strike. - Gilda's birthday party is tomorrow. - And who is Gilda? -A girl. - I knew it. And you know her. You are out and about with girls while I have to stay at this brothel and live like a nun. This is not the right place to make a scene. That is where you are wrong. You can learn a lot about the shabby character of men here. And what have you learned from this shabby character? Nothing. I don't know anything. All I can say is that he smells like a dead fish. A fish. Does he have any papers on him? - I didn't find any, just this weird thing. - Show me this weird thing! A watchmaker's eye glass! A watchmaker with hands as big as his? Look at my wrists. Listen, this is important. When your bad smelling friend leaves you have to follow him. Understand? Be careful. Good Luck. - Hey, when am I gonna see you again? - You won't have time to miss me. yeah, he's already told me this one... Oh, Adams. l have told Judy to shadow someone. Look after her in case she gets into any trouble. - I hope I won't get into a fight. - I want you to watch out for her! One more thing, where can I find the Admiral? - l have no clue. - But I think l have a clue. - At the confessional. - Confessional? Isn't he a Protestant? - Bob! - Women behind wheels... - You must come with me immediately. - Where to? To the island. My uncle wants to talk to you. Yesterday evening he'd almost kicked me out. After everyone had left last night he had another visitor. - And who was it? - The shadow. It was very strange. The shadow of a man suddenly appeared. He was as close as you, - I could've touched him. - But you couldn't recognize him? - No. - Tell me everything exactly how it happened. Everything was so mysterious. He asked me for the code numbers. - And you gave them to him. - How could I? I don't know them myself. - You don't know them? - No. | associate the numbers with imaginary pictures. Then I forget the numbers and only remember the pictures, in self-hypnosis. - And if someone knew the picture in your imagination? - It wouldn't help them. Only I can associate it with the numbers. The shadow bothers me. Can you describe him any closer? Well, it was just a shadow. Wait, I recognized something. - He had a strange walk. - A strange walk? - Yes. - That's very interesting. I want to ask you to stay on the island. - Would you like to? - Of course. Good. Gilda, would you please take care of the Major. My pleasure, uncle. Come with me, Major. - This is your room. - Very nice. - Where does this door go to? - To another guest room. It is locked. That is Mario's diving suit. Sometimes he stayed here over night. - Does he sleep here often? - Not anymore. He seems to have a remarkable literary taste. Same with pyjamas. Your size? Thank you. I'll barely use them. Good night. As you like. Good night. You can put your mind at rest. You'll be totally undisturbed here. At least where I'm concerned. - May | disturb your reading? - Colonel Matson! We are neighbours. Surprised, huh? Nothing here can surprise me any longer. - But how did you... - I thought it was the right thing to come. The situation is getting more critical and the reports reaching us in London are very confused. No wonder, because some things are indeed confused here. Please take a seat. Professor Larsen for example. Until now we had to force our protective measures unto him and tonight he is asking me for help. Not one minute too early. he attack of the Projection Island is planned for tomorrow evening. A nice way to celebrate Miss. Larsen's birthday. How do you know all this? I just found it out today. Oh well, we have our sources. Do you have any idea from where the attack could be expected? I have... If I may show this to you. I assume that the frogmen will come out of the grotto that is connected to the cemetery's chapel. The entrance to the old chapel is hidden by this old guy here. The brigade group of frogmen is ready, boss. Send them as backup to the shark cliffs. - They will execute the second wave of attacks. - Yes, boss. All further orders will come from the house of the professor. - I will be at the birthday party. - Yes, boss. - Everyone through the passage way. - Kaspar! - Yes, boss. - Remove all evidence in the chapel. The secret service found out about it. - They shall find nothing but an empty confessional. - Yes, boss. I guess now you are disappointed. Why? I went out to catch a frog and I caught a spy. What have you done there? Only his duty. Let him go, Major. May I introduce to you the dear Dr. Krishna. Working on the same case for the secret service. I already had the pleasure. Why was I not informed? That's the law of the secret service. Never let the left hand know what the right one is doing. Please excuse me dear colleague - but frogmen after midnight make me feel suspicious. - l was suspicious, too. That's why I inspected our frogmen. Because I guess all hell will break loose soon. - I'm ready. - That depends on the boss. The mirror of death is ready for combat. Admiral Quency. ready for combat as well as I can see. A purely precautionary measure, Major. You never know who you will run into in the dark. There are times when you know it just too well. Are you interested to find out what I have discovered? Yes, of course. I came to discuss the current state of things, gentlemen. But first l have to add a piece of information myself. - The balloon will go up tomorrow. - Maybe even today. - Mr. Botani's secretary has been shot. - Yes. - Excuse me for bothering you Gilda but... - But you aren't disturbing me, uncle. I can't sleep. Because I'm worried about what will happen one day after I'm not here anymore. But uncle, you are so healthy I envy you. No. That's not what I mean, Gilda. But if suddenly something should happen to me no one will be there who could open the steel arch. Because no one except me knows the code numbers. l have to share the secret. But I don't know with who. - And what about Jason Monta? - Monta may be very reliable. Yes, he has helped me a lot with the money. But absolute power ruins people. In the wrong hands my invention could be a catastrophe for the whole world. Would you trust me? Gilda, you are still so young and the responsibility is big. Gigantic! Uncle, I would never betray you. Never. Ever. If you would do that you wouldn't betray me, but the whole world. Ok, listen. The code is an imaginary picture from which you can get the numbers. It's the picture of a chess board with the end position of the 11th round of the master match at the tournament in Baden-Baden 1925. Only the numbers, not the letters. The position numbers of the white figurines are to be turned to the left on the steel door. The black ones, to the right. There is this hellish machine. Via the planets the rays can be reflected to even! point on the earth. What is the source of an energy this powerful? - This. This is the soul of the machine. - A small box like that. Satellites in space are controlled by even smaller machines. The main thing is this synthetic ruby. With its help light beams are bundled and structured after the laser principal. They are sent between two mirrors, bombarding each other, until they multiply their power to the point, where they can explode in any given direction. Sardine boat number 13? - We'll give this fat fish some bait. - You mean the code number? - Yes. We have to give it to them somehow. - Mabuse? But we don't know who he is. We don't but the professor will give it to them. You are in a deep, deep sleep. Can you hear me? - I can hear you. - I have a message for the shadow. - He was here. - When he comes back you give him the code numbers. I don't know the numbers. When he comes back you give him the code numbers! When he comes back I'll give him the numbers. 8 right, 7 left, 6 right, 5 left, 4 right. And when the shadow comes you will give him the numbers. I will give him the numbers. - And then you will forget them. - And then I will forget them. - Good morning, professor. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, excellent. - But I had strange dream. - A strange dream? The shadow came back. He asked me for the code. - Did you give it to him? - How could I? I don't know the code. But the strange thing is that in my dream I knew it. So in your dream you knew it? There is Gilda, I want to wish her a happy birthday. - My best wishes for your birthday. - Thank you. - Doesn't the ocean look incredible. - Yes, it's a beautiful day. - Don't you want to come with me? - No, no. - Are you Mr. Larsen? - Wait, I'll come and get it. - There you are. - Thank you. They are fantastic, my first flowers. Who are they from? No card. An anonymous admirer. - That's why they smell so sweet. - Hm, strange. It's way too heavy. Get down! Oh, my God! That was close. - If I hadn't thought of the eye glass. - You thought of an eye glass? You need it to repair watches or bombs with a timer. - But who would do something like this? - Maybe one of your 'team mates' to raise the stakes? - Let me go inside. - Keep your hands off. - It can turn out bad the next time. - That's a risk I have to take. Thank you, Bob What is your goddamn ambition good for? - Is this game really worth it? - If the stakes are this high. Tonight after the party we could spend some time together. - Wouldn't that be nice? - Tonight's party is gonna be the bomb. You will have a lot of uninvited guests. One group of the frogmen will transport the death mirror. - Already taken care of, boss. - The diving bell? - Ready. - The submarine? Out of the radar's reach. The enemy has been warned. We will attack earlier than planned. Excuse me. Do you have enough to drink? - Where is the Admiral? - In his room. - Are you sure? - He thinks that his face wouldn't fit in at a party. - That could also be an excuse. - And are you gonna suspect me next? - It's my privilege. - Well, cheers then. - Judy! - No names! - Agent 008 at your service. - These two look particularly suspicious to me. My compliments Agent 008. You did very good work last night. If he is talking about the date of the attack, I have to agree. - I only did my duty. - Now you are a real member of the service. Judy, oh pardon me, Agent 008 should take care of Gilda. - Yes. Are you armed? - Yes, sir. I'm prep... I have all... - What does she have? - Wait... it was right here. I found it, I'm ready. Finally I get to meet your little charming blonde girlfriend. - Judy, right? - This is Gilda Larsen. Oh, I have to congratulate you then. How old are you now? - Definitely not a year younger. - Yes, if that would be possible... Where did Bob hide you for so long? - She is uhm... - At a resort for rich daughters. That sounds nice. - I'm sure you would like it there. - Really? You would get along with the girls there perfectly. - Why don't you show her around a little bit? - Of course, I'm sure she will like it. Right, Bob? I'm glad the two are getting along so well. - Good evening. - Mr. Botani. Where is your company? Pluto is at home. He doesn't like parties. - I thought you were inseparable. - Oh, he doesn't mind. - Where is the professor? - He wants to rest a little. I have something for Gilda, excuse me. - Flowers from his wife's grave. - Don't, Major. Yes, Colonel. The Montas are arriving. They left the flood light on. - Do you think it's a sign? - Maybe. Get on with it. You will take care of the shore. The others stay for the second wave of attacks. Best of luck guys. - Mario is dead. - How? - Frogman. - Go tell his brother. Mr. Monta, your brother has been shot. I'm going to the Admiral. You take over the command. - Yes sir. - Have they already arrived? I suppose so. Make sure the ladies are safe. Come with me, ladies. You too, Judy. - But I'm part of the secret service. - Go with the professor. - Can't I help? - Go. - We have to get to the laboratory quick. - I know but does the elevator work? Yes, it has its own power unit. Everyone is waiting here until we get the sign to attack. Close the door. The bait has been thrown. All we can do now, is wait until the fish takes it. - Several boats. Ours are among them. - Turn off the light. I will definitely not miss when I shoot, boss. Enough with your silly jokes, Major. put your hands up. Nice and slowly. - I'm sorry but one will do in my case. - No, both! - He can't. Are you crazy? - I'm afraid it looks like it. - I'm sorry Major. - I thank you very much Doctor. You fool, this is Mabuse! Please! The red button that will bring the decision. World domination is in reach of my little finger. Finally my destiny is fulfilled. You are right but your destiny will be the gallows. The later the evening, the more beautiful the guests. Freeze, don't move. I don't want to disturb the henchman. Yes, you could really be my twin. Your masquerade was almost successful. But only almost. - And I believed it. - Let's talk business now. I would recommend you put away your guns first. Great idea. My finger is on the red button. Should someone shoot at me I'd still have enough time to push it. The rays will be thrown to earth via the moon. And the world would die with me. You have exactly 3 seconds, to drop your ridiculously little weapons in front of my feet. I'm not joking Major Anders. One, two, three... You have overlooked a little detail Dr. Mabuse. I took the liberty of removing the synthetic ruby. This huge machine can't even light a cigarette without the stone. Ok, the show is over. Let's see who was playing the lead. Look at this. The chess partner of the professor. The man who never left his wife's grave without flowers. Let's bring this nice guy upstairs. - Hands up! - Get down, boss! Let's get out of here. - They can't make it too far. - No. Let's start 'Operation Dolphin'. Send the order to our underwater combat teams. - Give me cover. - Adams! Don't be a fool! Adams! Everyone back to boat number 13! Attention everybody! Attention everybody! Order from the Admiral: None of these guys must get back to sardine boat number 13. There they are. Don't let them through. You swim over here and you over there. We are attacking! Everybody to the front! Looks good, doesn't it? In memory of the mirror of death. The most powerful invention of our times and this is the rest of it. And yet Professor Larsen had to destroy his work. - The world wasn't ready for it. - I guess you are right. Why so negative, you did good work? Botani could escape. We did our best and looked for him everywhere. He must be dead. Are you sure? - That is Pluto. - The dog. He always was right next to Botani. Pluto should've given us the hint that Botani was behind the mask of Mabuse. Faster! Coast guard! Attention everyone! Attention everyone! Hearse on coastal road heading to the airport. Get your guns ready, something is up. They are coming closer. Get ready. Ok, now. It wasn't me. It was Mabuse. He used my brain. It wasn't me. It was Mabuse. He used my brain. A dog can feel things that are hidden for the human mind.
