Higashino Keigo. 3 Weeks Drama SP I think I'm being targeted. What is? My life. What? Where did you get that from? I'm not boosting, but I have an intuition for things like this. Then, tell me. Neh. If I tell, it'll really come true. - Woah. How timid of you. - You saw through me. By the way, didn't you say it's your book signing today? "Yuki Rikako - Book Signing" I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry for this. Spare me that. "Yuki Rikako Commemoration Exhibition" "Female Mystery Writer - Yuki Rikako Book Signing" "Hagio Fuyuko" How bold of you to skip it. But... You must think it's funny for a author who haven't wrote a single word to hold a book signing. But I'm still looking forward to your new book. Don't bother. Things are convenient in novels. There's a clear line between good and bad. In reality, the line is fuzzy. - What's that about? - Nothing. They're blooming. Well, they'll still fall off soon. Sensei. I'll be troubled if you don't keep your promise. - I'm sorry. - What were you doing? Nothing. Was with Kawazu... Don't tell me you're thinking about marriage? Never. I'm still can't forget that now. I was your matchmaker, but please don't fall in too deep. It's important to keep an appropriate distance. - I know. - Please do it. Is it Mr Kawazu? Hi. It's me. Can we meet now? Sure. Where... Sorry. I skipped my book signing, and now, my editor is scowling at me across the table. I see. Nevermind then. What's wrong? Did anything happen? Hm? Nothing. It's fine. Bye. Coming. Yes? - Is Yuki Rikako in? - Yes. It's me. I'm Kamata from the East Fukuzawa Division. - Did something... - Do you know Kawazu Masayuki? Yes. His body was found this morning. He was found floating on the Onagi River near the Mannen Bridge. It's not clear if it's an accident, suicide, or murder. "The murderous intent that had originated from the unpopulated, deserted island" "The 11 Words Murder" Subbed by Shioki Ms Yuki. We have heard from Mr Kawazu's sister, that you were close with Mr Kawazu? - Yes. - Is he your boyfriend? I thought of him as one. Did he tell you any of his troubles or anything? No. Do you know what was he working as? I only know he's a freelance writer. He lamented to his sister that he lost 2 serials recently at the same time. Do you know that? No. - He is also in debt. - Debt? Around 2 million. You wasn't aware of that? Yes. He might have suicided because he wasn't able to repay his debt. Hold on. The Kawazu I know won't... But, you wasn't aware of his debts and decreasing work, weren't you? Maybe... he doesn't want to trouble you with his problems. They're blooming. Well, they'll still fall off soon. I'm coming in. Sensei? Yuki-sensei. Yuki-sensei?! Sensei? His body was found here. Hey...Hey...don't. I am a big fan of yours, Yuki Rikako. I want to read more of your works. I have also lost someone close to me all of a sudden. But somehow, I was able to move forward... Don't worry. I'm not jumping. What? I just can't accept the fact that he killed himself. He told me his life is being targeted. I think he was murdered. Murdered? So I'm going to find out the truth. "Kawazu" Sorry for making such a request. - Can I really take them? - Yes. You can. - I'm moving them. - Thank you. He sees these materials as his treasure. I'm sure bro will be happy if you take them. Thanks for your help. Did he say anything about me? Yes. Frequently. He said you're a talented mystery writer. Please take this, his schedule book. - Excuse me. - Yes. You are... I'm Niizato, Kawazu's colleague, a photographer. - I'm Kawazu's sister... - Actually, I passed him some important materials. I'd like to have it back. Ah. Your materials are... Sorry, but I have taken all his materials. They're being delivered to my house right now. Oh. I really need them urgently. I see. Then, could you come over to my house tomorrow? - I can? - Yes. Thank god. Then, tomorrow at 6. I'm sure they will be delivered by then. This is my address. - I'm Yuki. - I'm Niizato. And can you please leave the box untouched until I get there? Huh? It'll be a pain if they got messed up. Ok. I got it. She doesn't want you to open the box. Something must be wrong. Is there something inside she doesn't want anyone else to see? Here you go. My specialty, mushroom gruel. Thanks. I'm digging in. Yummmmmy. - Did you discover anything? - I did. This. Before the day Kawazu died. Didn't he merely went to the gym? He injured his leg. He shouldn't be able to exercise. Are you fine? Don't worry. I treat this as part of a rehabilitation. Maybe he went to meet President Yamamori from the Yamamori Sports Plaza? He's pretty famous. Maybe he went there for some information gathering. I have a favor to ask. Could you request for an interview with President Yamamori? OK. I'll try. Yes? - Still sleeping? - Yaaa. I got the approval for President Yamamori's interview. - Seriously? - But he's only free at 2pm. Can you make it? Ya. I got it. See you later. OK "You can't fight with an empty stomach" Coming. Yes? - Excuse me, where do I put them? - Please place them here. OK. I'm entering. - Please sign here. - OK. - OK. Thanks. - Thank you very much. - He married in? - Yes. President's Yamamori Takuya's wife belongs to the Yamamori Group's family. Which means he married in. I see. Rumors have surfaced recently. That after obtaining the title of Sports Critic, he's going to enter politics. Sorry to keep you waiting. - I'm Harumura, his secretary. - Nice to meet you. Sorry, but our President is currently dealing with an urgent matter. He'll probably take an hour. He told me to bring the ladies to the gym while they wait. But... We have already prepared jerseys and towels for you guys. We have a SPA and gym here. Please follow me. 3, 4. Great. Slowly. Yes. 1, 2, 3, 4. Return slowly. Mr Ishikura, over here. OK. Please continue at this pace. Please come in. Good afternoon. He's our Chief Instructor, Ishikura. This is Ms Yuki, a novelist, and Ms Hagio, from the Publisher. They're here to gather information for a mystery novel. Oh. A mystery novel. Is it something like a instructor getting murdered? Excuse me. How do I use this? This machine is called Kinesis. - Want to give it a try? - Sure. Ishikura is the younger brother of our President. Oh, I see. - Please try it too. - OK. - Come in. - Sorry for intruding. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - Not at all. - I'm Yamamori. - I'm Hagio from EiRiN Publishing. Nice to meet you. - Take a seat. - So, how can I help you? Actually... I'm thinking of setting my mystery novel in a sports club. So we're here to seek your expertise. "Why was her boyfriend killed?" "The female mystery writer closes in on the truth!" That's funny. By the way, do you know Mr Kawazu Masayuki? - Mr Kawazu? - Yes. - Oh, the freelancer? - Yes. That's him. Yes. He was once my employee. We get together for a drink occasionally. Anything wrong with him? He passed away. - When? - Few days ago. - Was he ill? - No. He was found floating on the river. It could be an accident, or suicide. I see. Mr Yamamori. You met him on the 9th at 4pm, didn't you? Did he tell you anything then? He was gathering information just like you. Nothing in particular happened. Like he was being targeted? That's impossible. But, why did you ask that? I think Kawazu is murdered. He didn't tell you anything else... Excuse me. Hello. Thanks for your help. Yes. Yes. No. It hasn't been decided on yet. No, it'll be by then. Yes. Then, we should leave now. Eh? Thank you very much. Yes. I'm glad you said that. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We'll be leaving now. - He's in, right? - Yes. In his room. They are the President's wife, Masae, and daughter, Yumi. Yumi is born visually impaired. But President says it not healthy to be cooped up at home. So she often come here to exercise. Seems like he isn't aware of Mr Kawazu's death. But they just met recently. Why would he ask "Is he ill?" Maybe he knows. About his death. - AH! What time is it? - 5pm. Shit. I have a meeting with Ms Niizato. I'm off. - This is Yuki. - This is Niizato. - You're already there? - No. While I was investigating some other matter, I found what I was looking for. - Then, you're not coming anymore? - Yes. Sorry for bothering you. I got it. Yes. See ya. - What's wrong? - My house was broken into. Eh? Did something went missing? - Yes. - What is it? Kawazu's materials. I need you to refer me to someone. OK. It's the Editor-in-charge of Kawazu and Niizato's work. I want to ask about their relation. - A serial traveler journal? - Yes. Kawazu wrote the article, while Niizato took the photos. Both of them went to various places to gather information. But the serial was discontinued a year ago. It wasn't very popular though. They met with an accident on the way to Hatsune Island. Accident? The cruise capsized on the way to the island. If I remember correctly, there were around 10 passengers. 1 of them died. The rest swam to a deserted island safely. Are Kawazu and Niizato among them? Yes. But Kawazu injured his leg then. And so he gave up on the traveler's journal. - Where did you get that? - Huh? I was just careless. Do you know who the other passengers are? If I'm not wrong, they are the members of some sports club. The Yamamori Sports Plaza? Yes. That's it. The President organized it. Yes. Yes. OK. Niizato says she can meet me tomorrow afternoon. - Please be careful. - I will. "Niizato Miyuki-sama" "The murderous intent that had originated from the unpopulated, deserted island" - Looks like something happened. - Even the police came. - Woah. Look at the crowd. - Hurry! Eh. What? Someone jumped. - A woman. - Please stay back. - Please stay back. - Still so young. Don't crowd around. Stay back. "Female fell from apartment" "Investigations ongoing to determine if it's an accident or suicide" If this really is a case of serial murders, you might get targeted too. Let's forget about it. I can't do that. Don't put on such a serious face. OK. If I get to the bottom of the truth, I'll write them into a book. Is that fine? I got it. But I want to read a original story from you. So, what's your plan now? I'll investigate the boating incident. This is what you want. Sorry for troubling you. No. It's nothing troublesome at all. Why do you need the participant list for the cruise tour? I plan to include a cruise tour in my next novel. I see. It must be hard work to consider so many things. These are all personal particulars, {\a6}"2010 Hatsune Island Cruise Tour" - 10 Participants so please just treat them as reference. OK. I heard that there was an accident a year ago? I think there was. But I wasn't working here yet, so I don't know much about it. Is Mr Kanai Saburou, an employee here? Yes. He works behind the scenes, maintaining the equipments. I'll like to speak to him. Is he free right now? - Now? - Yes. It'll be great if I can find out more about the situation then. I got it. Please wait here. Gathering information again? Yes. Sorry for intruding again. Not at all. Wanna do some muscle training again? - Not today. - I see. Come here whenever you feel like it. He's coming over soon. Thank you very much. That's him. How can I help you? Sorry for disrupting your work. I'm Yuki, a novelist. I'm Kanai. I'll to ask you about the cruise tour a year ago. - Coffee. - OK. - I heard the cruise capsized? - Yes. You swam to a deserted island, before being saved. Am I right? I barely escaped from death then. - But someone died. - Yes. It was high wave then. So vision was bad. What happened at the deserted island? Nothing much. We hid behind the rocks to escape the rain and wind. And waited for help to arrive. What did you guys talk about? I was in a daze then. I don't remember much. - Don't remember? - Yes. You seems pretty interested in that accident. Yes. I'll be including a boating incident in my next novel. Thank you very much. - It serve as a good reference. - You're welcome. - Ms Harumura. Thank you too. - You're welcome. We'll take our leave now. Are you Ms Harumura's friend? You told Mr Kanai, didn't you? - To hurry up and marry. - Marry? Both of them? Opps. I said too much. The causality from the incident is Takemoto Yukihiro. And this guy Kanai doesn't remember anything. Either that, or he's hiding something. And this guy, Sakagami Yutaka, appeared in a popular drama lately. He's a popular actor. - Can you get an interview with him? - I'll try. And could you make an appointment with Furuzawa Yasuko too? - Got it. - I'll visit the Takemoto's. "Takemoto" Excuse me, but what's your relationship with my brother? I have never met Mr Yukihiro before. I'm thinking of including a boating accident in my novel, so it'll be great if I can hear from you. I see. I thought you were his friend. He was a writer once too. - Is that so? - I think he was a report writer. He wanders abroad, and writes about anything that happens. - Wanders abroad? - Yes. He also went to several dangerous places. I can't believe he died in the sea in Japan. Beside, he was in the swimming club. He's a good swimmer. That's why I can't believe only my brother died. I see. Why was he on that cruise tour? He joined the sports club, which organized the cruise. Who was his acquaintance there? I'm not sure about that. - But he had a girlfriend. - Girlfriend? After the accident, I saw a note from a female in his room. It says, "I've returned the spare key. I did some cleaning up too." And one of his belongings went missing. - Belongings? - A hip flask. It's flat, and you can put whiskey in it. When his body was found, that was the only item in his possession. His girlfriend probably took it as a memento. - Hello? - Sensei. Thanks for your hard work. The actor, Sakagami Yutaka gave his OK for an interview tomorrow. Thanks. What about Furuzawa Yasuko? She seems to have moved. And I couldn't contact her. I see. Anyway, I'll tell you the time and place for Mr Sakagami's interview. OK. "The murderous intent that had originated from the unpopulated, deserted island" It must be terrible a year ago. Did you swim to the deserted island? Yes. - But why did only Takemoto drowned? - No idea. Oh ya, he said he was a bad swimmer. That could be the reason why. He's a bad swimmer? Yes. That was what he said. Did he really die from drowning? What do you mean? Actually I've heard. That he was in the swimming club, and is a good swimmer. I had no idea. I don't know anything. I'm going back to my practice. Mr Sakagami. Do you still remember Kawazu and Niizato from that same tour? They were killed. Why did Mr Sakagami lie? He must be hiding something. If everyone is singing the same tune, then President Yamamori must have ordered them to do so. We don't even know where Furuzawa is. Hello. This is Hagio. Yes. What do you mean? Yes. Yes. I understand. See you tomorrow. Mr Sakagami said he has something to tell us. He will call us again tomorrow. "Back off, or you shall die" I'm in a hurry, so I'll be brief. You wanted to find out about the boating accident 1 year ago. That's why you met up with many people. Yes. But no one told me the truth. Why do you think that they're lying? In the first place, that accident had nothing to do with you. But because of that, Kawazu and Niizato were... And you're saying that that's why both of them were killed? The 2 of them are indeed unfortunate. But you can't say that. Anyway, that's just an accident. Nothing more, nothing less. Excuse me. Papa. Sorry for disturbing. So it's time. My apologizes. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. She the novelist, Yuki Rikako. She seeking our President's expertise for her next work. Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. I'm Yuki Rikako. I'm Yamamori Yumi. She's having lunch with President later. Ah. Sorry. Don't worry. I was also abit late. - Bye. - Bye. Ms Yuki. The most important thing is knowing when to back off. What's wrong? I'm making my "once-in-a-lifetime" dinner today. Come and eat it. Wah, sounds great. I'm coming over after work. So, did Mr Sakagami called? Not yet. I hope he doesn't change his mind. I think it's about time for me to call him. How did the meeting with President Yamamori go? He was in a hurry. "Actor, Sakagami Yutaka fell" "and got hit by the passing train." "His whole body was hit hard." "On the way to the hospital he was pronounced dead." Hold on. "The police are investigating with the assumption that Sakagami fell accidentally." "As an actor, Mr Sakagami has acted in the latest hit drama." "He has also crossed over to plays and movies." "As a young actor, he has garnered the attention." "The sudden death of a hopeful, popular, young actor" "has brought his fans, friends..." Sensei? What's wrong? Yuki-sensei?! "People involved in the boating accident dying one after another!" "What exactly happened on the cruise tour?" Are you alright? Just a graze. The doctor said nothing else was wrong. Thank god. I told you, we should stop this. It's clear now. The boating accident had something to do with the serial murders. Sensei. Fuyuko. Can you lend me your car tomorrow? Good afternoon, Yumi. Yuki-sensei? - How did you know? - Your smell. I see. I'm here today to ask you something. I want to know what happened during on the deserted island? I lost conscious and couldn't remember much. Just tell me what you remember. I don't know anything. Listen here. Kawazu, Niizato, Sakagami. They drifted to the deserted island then. They got killed, one after another. - What?! - If we leave it alone, more people might get killed. Including Papa? Yes. I can only ask you about it. I felt like I lost my footings then. And was thrown out into the sea. I lost conscious at that time. When I woke up, I was lying on the ground. Thank god. Yumi is safe. I heard voices, and realized others got saved. I felt relieved. But there was a woman crying. "Please. Save my boyfriend." Boyfriend? She cried several times. The woman did? Not sure. Someone else said it's impossible. Even so, the woman continued on. Eventually, I lost conscious again. Thank you, Yumi. Which means that the person crying for help for Takemoto is Furuzawa Yasuko? Seems like it. Because they refused to save her boyfriend, Furuzawa killed them out of revenge. The problem is, where is she right now. You sent Yumi back, didn't you? Yes. Stop meddling any further. Is the killer, Furuzawa Yasuko? You don't intend to back off? I don't. No choice then. We're going to Hatsune island next month by boat. Hatsune Island? Wanna come along? Don't you want to find out the truth? If you feel uneasy alone, you can invite Ms Hagio. If you're going, she will come along too. I got it. I'm returning this. President Yamamori has my house keys. What?! When we're at the gym, he probably took the keys out from your bag in the locker, and made a spare key. Help yourself. We have lots more BBQ-ing. Eat more. Scallop. Spiny lobsters. It's lobsters! Here. It's done. Please eat more. - Reach. - That's fast. That's big, Yusuke. I'm throwing this. I'm losing anyway. I just need one more! - Here. - Thanks. I guess nothing happened. Ya. - Oh. - What? Ms Harumura just stepped outside. Ms Harumura? I wonder what's she doing at this hour. It's already 9.40pm. A stroll, maybe? What are you doing? I might turn this case into a novel one day. So I'm doing some organizing right now. - Sensei. - Yes? Why were you unable to write a single word? That is... I'll tell you next time. OK? OK. Well, I'm going to shower now. OK. The boat trip is really tiring. Ya. I'm already sleepy. It's still 10, but let's sleep, shall we? "The Rotating Forest" - By Yuki Rikako - Can't sleep? - Yes. Why don't you join us? Have you seen Fuyuko? Ms Hagio? No. I came down 30 mins ago. But I didn't see her. Her shoes is not around, so I thought she went out. - When did she leave? - We went to bed at 10. And I fell asleep right away. - Manager. - Yes. Can I borrow the flashlights? Not a problem. But please be careful. The edge of the cliff is not far off. - Yusuke. You come along too. - OK. I'm going too. - Yusuke. Search there. - OK. - We will search over there. - OK. Why did she go out at this hour? No idea. Fuyuko! Ms Hagio! Fuyuko! Ms Hagio! - Be careful. - OK. Manager. Is she in the hotel? I searched everywhere, but she isn't in. - Yusuke? - Nowhere. No choice then. I'll wait here. I'll search again when daybreaks. I'll wait too. - Fuyuko. - Ms Hagio. Let's go back. - What do you mean? - We're going back. Don't look. Shall I open the windows? Did Fuyuko die? Where's the rest? In the lobby. The police came from Tokyo and is questioning them now. Then, I must go down too. Are you alright? Sorry, but can you leave first? OK. How many times have you read this. You asked me yesterday, didn't you? Why was I unable to write a single word. I had a divorce 3 years ago. You know, right. He was also a novelist. - Dinner is ready. - I'll have it later. Sorry for disturbing you. When we got married, he was a best-seller. While I was still an unknown newbie. I'm nothing compared to him. But I got an award before him. Since then, things started to change. I got flooded with work requests. And had no time to take notice of my surroundings. Hello. Yes. Sorry. Yuki isn't in. Before I know it, I got really busy. - I'm back. - Welcome home. Sorry. I should be the one doing that. Don't worry. You're busy, aren't you? Thanks. I'll take over after I change. We underwent a role reversal. He is now supporting the busy me. - I'm back. - Welcome back. - Dinner will be ready soon. - Sorry. I already ate. I see. Nevermind then. I'll eat alone. - Sorry. - It's OK. However, behind his smiling face, he has been holding back all along. - Dinner's ready. - Thanks. Looks yummy. Let's eat while it's warm. Sorry. Hello. Yes. What do you mean? You said it's fine to leave it at that during the meeting then. It's impossible. There's no time left. If I change that part right now... If that was an interesting book, I can still bear with it. But I don't even think it is. Since then, I haven't been able to write a single word. Actually, I thought of quiting from being a novelist. But, I felt that, if Fuyuko is here, I'll be able to write again someday. Even so, why? Now, I won't be able to write again. So, how is it, Mr Detective? Let me see. It's an accident. An accident? That's impossible. - Fuyuko was murdered. - What did you say? Are you implying that the murderer is among us? Yes. That's it. - Ms Yuki Rikako, right? - Yes. - What you just said, is impossible. - Impossible? According the Mr Yamamori, you said, that Ms Hagio stayed in the room - at least until 10pm. - Yes. Mr Yamamori and his group came to the lobby at 10.30pm. In other words, within the 30mins after 10pm, Ms Hagio went outside. At that time, Mr Yamamori and Mr Ishikura were playing mahjong with the hotel Manager and the cook. Mrs Yamamori brought her daughter, Yumi back to their room before 10pm. And met them later at the mahjong room. Mr Kanai and Ms Harumura went to the rooftop for stargazing after seeking guidance from the staffs at 10pm. That's right. We showed them the way. Hold on. Harumura went outside at 9.40 last night. Fuyuko saw her. I was probably out to check out the road then. That's right. I wanted Yumi to hear the insects. But heard that it was dangerous and gave up. How long were you outside? Around 10 mins. After that, I went to the rooftop with Kanai. Which means everyone here has an alibi from 10 to 10.30. Just stop it. In the first place, why do we need to kill her? Masae. Yumi. Sit, and don't stand. OK. - Yuki-sensei. - Yes? I don't know who to tell this to. And no one else asked me too. Do you know something? I'm worried because what I remembered is a little different from what they said. Tell me. Last night, after Ms Harumura left the hotel, the door was opened twice. I felt the wind blowing in. The door was opened twice. On the last time the door opened, I smelled a whiff of cigarette. Cigarette? Is it useful? Yes. Thanks. Can I meet you now? Ms Furuzawa Yasuko. Sorry to keep you waiting. Good evening, Ms Harumura Shiduko. Or should I call you, Furuzawa Yasuko? No. It's Harumura. Why were you using a fake name during that accident? My parents owned a company in Nagoya. A year ago, I was forced to get engaged. I ran away from home, and eloped with Kanai. It was in order to hide from my parents. So you came to Tokyo? I met Takemoto Yukihiro during an exchange, and sought his help. The Takemoto who died? Yes. When Takemoto's friend went overseas, I borrowed her room. The owner of the room is Furuzawa Yasuko. I ended up using her name at the time of the accident. But, how did you realize I was her? Before that, I need you to clarify something. The murderer is Fuyuko, isn't it? Kawazu, Niizato, Sakagami. She killed them. Yes. She did it. Don't crowd around. Stay back. And she wanted to kill us. I saw the light from Yumi's words. Yumi? You went outside at around 9.40. And she noticed that the door was opened twice after that. Moreover, she smelled cigarette during the second time. The only smoker is Kanai. Which means, Harumura, someone, and Kanai went outside in this order. So I thought about who the middle person is. - But everyone has an alibi. - That's right. So I thought someone was lying. But then I realized. The most dubious words came from me. I thought I went to bed with Fuyuko at 10. But I was wrong. While I was showering, Fuyuko fasten the clock by 30mins. Then, she gave me a drugged juice. And told me she saw you at 9.40. It's still 10, but let's sleep, shall we? I went to bed at 9.30, not 10. After that, Fuyuko turned the clock back, and went outside. She planned to kill you, return, and wake me up. In order to create an alibi. But she failed to return. She planned to kill you, but Kanai appeared, and she fell. Stop! Stop it! It's exactly what you said. Ms Hagio wanted to kill me. Fuyuko is Takemoto's girlfriend, isn't she? And this. Do you recognize this? Takemoto was holding onto this when he died. And Fuyuko took it. Takemoto wrote what happened down on a note. I'm sure he wanted to turn it into a novel. This is what's written. "Yamamori, Masae, Yumi, Sakagami" "Kawazu, Niizato, Ishikura, Harumura, Takemoto" "reached the deserted island. Kanai is late." Furuzawa's name is not written down. And that's how you knew I was Furuzawa? It was Kanai who was late, not Takemoto. That's why you cried for help for Kanai, your boyfriend, frantically. And Takemoto went to save him. Ms Harumura. What happened on the deserted island? Ms Harumura. I have no choice. Sanburou. I'll tell you everything. It's fine. On that day, when I was getting away from the ship, I hit my head, and lost conscious. Niizato is here too! Great. She's safe! Hey! Come here. Kawazu is injured. Please. Help. Save my boyfriend! Please. Save him. I begged for help frantically. Then, Takemoto offered his help. I'll save him! He laid out a condition. A condition? To spend a night together with my girlfriend. He likes Shiduko. Then? Before I could answer... What were you thinking? That's inhumane! Then, why don't you go and save him! With your broken leg! Please! Someone, save him! This is absurd! So you agreed? Yes. Takemoto saved Kanai. After I woke up, I learned about the transaction. I searched for them frantically. Takemoto was deciding when we should meet next time. But I wasn't too sure then... I saw that as my girlfriend being attacked. And... President Yamamori took his pulse... I decided to turn myself in. But he said, that there's no need to as what I did was to save my girlfriend. So you threw the body? With this, the truth is buried. Everyone thought so. But this was left, and Fuyuko started investigating. I'm sure Ms Hagio saw Mr Kawazu's notes, and understood everything. Mr Kawazu said he wanted to publicize the truth someday. And put together what happened at the deserted island. I'm not boosting, but I have an intuition for things like this. Things are convenient in novels. There's a clear line between good and bad. In reality, the line is fuzzy. We received this letter one after another. "The murderous intent that had originated from the unpopulated, deserted island" These mere 11 words shook us up. Someone knew about our secret. And even wanted revenge. And then, we realized you were closing in onto the truth. Sorry. Everything was done by me. But, after Sakagami was killed, I felt Hagio was fishy. Why? I knew the editor of Takemoto's first book was Hagio Fuyuko. President said he won't tell anyone about the murder. In return, he wants us to forget about what happened at the deserted island. That's why he invited Ms Hagio to Hatsune island. If you feel uneasy alone, you can invite Ms Hagio. Ms Hagio called me out. And told her about our transaction. But, she already knew everything. Takemoto's body was found clinging tightly to the rocks. Takemoto only lost conscious then. Yet we threw him into the sea. And he really died. He risked his life to save others. Yet, you guys scolded him for playing foul, and killed him without mercy. You guys are the worst! Stop! Stop it! I have also lost someone close to me all of a sudden. But somehow, I was able to move forward... Here you go. My specialty, mushroom gruel. I'm such a fool. In the end, I killed 2 people using protecting Shiduko as an excuse. Everytime, President Yamamori offered to cover up for me. This is the truth. I'll leave it to you. It is not. There's another need I need to confirm. What do you want at this hour? Harumura and Kanai had told me everything. You had a transaction with Kanai and Harumura that they shouldn't accept and sent them to kill Fuyuko, didn't you? I didn't do anything. They did it on their own. Indeed. You didn't do a thing. But in order to status and reputation, you committed a huge crime. What is it? Takemoto. If he wrote about the boating accident in his book, how would he describe the incident where you didn't went to save Kanai? - What do you want to say? - You were scared. That you will be written as a heartless President who refused to save an employee. That's why... You were awake? - Is that you, Yuki-sensei? - Yes. Yumi. It's late. Go and sleep. OK. But before that, I have a question for Sensei. Yes? Papa won't be targeted anymore, right? Yes. Nothing will happen again. That's great. You don't need to answer it. Bye and take care. You too. Bye. "You knew Takemoto was alive, but you killed him, didn't you?" But I'm still looking forward to your new book. But I want to read a original story from you.
