"But you didn't know it was Mussolini when you retweeted. It said, "It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep." That's a famous Mussolini quote, you retweeted it. Do you like the quote? Did you know it was Mussolini? Sure. It's okay to know it's Mussolini. Look, Mussolini was Mussolini. It's okay... It's a very good quote. It's a very interesting quote. And I know it, I saw it. I saw what... I know who said it but what difference does it make whether it's Mussolini or somebody else. It's certainly a very interesting quote. That's probably why I have between Facebook and Twitter 14 million people and a lot of people don't. It's a very interesting quote and people can talk about it. Do you want to be associated with a Fascist?" "Under blue skies, the aeroplane carrying Herr Hitler comes to rest at Venice. As the German Chancellor steps from the machine, he is greeted by Signor Mussolini. This is the first occasion on which these two famous dictators have met. Each holds in his hand the destiny of a great nation and the whole world looks with eager interest on this meeting. For any momentous decision made by either of these men must affect the whole of Europe, if not the world. Austria is the gravest problem in Europe today, a problem that can only be satisfactorily solved by Herr Hitler and the Duce. Will they do it? They can make this unhappy country the next battlefield. We're convinced that they will bring an end to the terrorist campaign and bring you peace and quiet in Central Europe." "Dear Mr Churchill. One of the reasons which so far has made the war a failure is lack of attention to practical details which when the crucial moment arrives, makes all the difference. Being a very practical person, I lay a few points before you in case they have been overlooked. With regards to the parachutists, has a map been drawn up of all the open spaces in England, Wales and Scotland? Each enemy plane can bring 50 parachutists. In one hour, 20 planes could land 1,000 enemy in the country. Are you prepared for them to try and land 10,000 men in one night in different parts of England? Have you enough rifles, machine guns, tanks and planes to deal with the situation? With regard to assassination, I give you the assurance that I never intend to do it again because it is not my talent. And all the previous years wasted in this place must be made up for by using my real gift which, if I had been allowed to use before, would probably have prevented this war. It is a mockery to go to war and to sacrifice all those lives for the freedom of the individual and, at the same time, do nothing towards a case like mine." Well, I think that Violet's childhood was pampered, was privileged, was, you know, very far from the blood and mire of Irish politics and from the slums on the other side of the Liffey, from the kind of reality that she became engaged with actually later on. And also because of her illness, definitely held back from the world, sequestered, as so many Victorian young women were. My grandfather was Violet's brother, which means that I'm a great-niece to Violet. There were four boys in the family and four girls, so Violet was one of four girls; my grandfather was one of the four boys. The boys were educated then at Harrow and Trinity Dublin and Oxford, but the girls were educated at home with a governess. Edward Gibson, Violet's father was the epitome of a Victorian conservative. He was born in 1837, the year that Victoria came to the throne and he goes through Trinity and he has a brief experience with the law and then he moves into politics with his father's wealth behind him. And it's a really good career decision for him because he's a very commanding figure, very tall with this shock of white hair on him and a booming voice. And a lot of people fairly early on have him tapped as a potential Prime Minister. He was elected MP for Dublin University in 1875 for the Conservatives and he very quickly becomes a darling of the Conservative Party. People like Benjamin Disraeli, Randolph Churchill are all taking notice of him. Two years later, 1877, he's Attorney General of Ireland and by 1880 he's Disraeli's principal advisor on Irish affairs. And his politics kind of culminates in his appointment as Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1885. Just as Gladstone is making his conversion to Home Rule, Gibson becomes the Lord Chancellor. He's also given a seat in the cabinet and becomes Baron Ashbourne; he's elevated to the peerage. Although the father was obviously a very big and important figure, he was also very much a family man and apparently he really delighted in his family and we've got a lovely photograph of him with three of the girls, and Violet apparently was very fond of him and they seemed to have been a close family. hen he became Lord Chancellor of Ireland and became Baron Ashbourne, then his children all became honourables and so Violet was then the Honourable Violet Albina Gibson. One of her elder sisters, Frances, was my great-grandmother. I've known about Violet ever since I was a little girl and been very sort of proud of the story because it's so bizarre. So, in the picture there is the Duke of York and the Duchess of York who are the future king and queen. So, this is in 1897. And they were visiting Lord and Lady Ashbourne in Dublin and in the picture also as well as Edward Gibson and his wife, the Duke of York and the Duchess of York, there's also Violet Gibson on the right, and she's there as a 21-year-old. All of the material necessities were dealt with, so she was sequestered in this gilded cage, if you like. Young Victorian women in the high echelons of society and particularly in the Anglo-Irish ascendency were pampered, adored and essentially manufactured, if you like, to make good marriages. Certainly not to be independent, free-wheeling entities. It was a sort of a paradoxical situation. They had trips abroad, they followed the season in France, in St Moritz, in London, in Buckingham Palace, the Court of Queen Victoria, in Mayfair where they also had a house. Christian Science preaches that health, wealth and happiness will come from leading a good life from being free of sin and that bad health is a result of sin and fear. And so, I think, that must have been very difficult for Violet who actually had a lot of ill-health when she was young. She certainly had peritonitis and various other fairly major illnesses, some unexplained and these kind of topics would be discussed in the family and would have been an important part of their whole belief system and I think that must have been very difficult for Violet to accept that on one hand if she was free of sin, she wouldn't be ill, but she was ill and, and quite badly ill constantly. I always think of the family motto when Lord Ashbourne was made the first Baron Ashbourne, he chose a family motto which was "Open O Ye Heavenly Gates". And I always see Violet as somebody who's looking for a way through towards a new Jerusalem, towards a kind of ecstatic reality to substitute for the reality of her own life which was very boundaried and contained by these childhood illnesses and by, I think, an uncomfortable sense of not really belonging in the place into which she was born. She's attached to theosophy. She goes to Switzerland to that end. I think she goes to Germany as well, Italy and France. Italy she's been as a child with her father to the lakes and has already developed a great fondness for the country. But just because you're from an establishment family doesn't mean that you are and this seems to be something that repeats itself particularly during the 1880s, 1890s and particularly with women, lot of women. Fanny and Anna Parnell and Jenny Wyse Power who all found the Ladies' Land League at this time. Or one thinks of Constance Markievicz or Maud Gonne or Mary Spring Rice. All of these people who'd grown up in Protestant households that were imperial in outlook and yet the daughters of these families are saying, "No, let's rebel against the system." "For a whole year, I have been bothering myself over religion and can now see no way out of becoming a Catholic. I have had a terrible time since giving up Christian Science. I am very sincerely sorry if you mind my becoming a Catholic. I hated the idea myself for a long time, but gradually saw that it was mere prejudice which was keeping me back." The problem starts when she is introduced to the idea of converting to Catholicism, most likely through her brother Willie. And it's through Willie, I think that Violet begins to find a route to what she believes will be a new Jerusalem where the heavenly gates will open and it's a particular kind of Catholicism. Willie's converted in Oxford and that's the centre of what's known as the Oxford Modernist Movement. He's a Socialist Catholic and I see her attachment to Christian Science and theosophy and then finally to Catholicism, to Modernist Catholicism, as something that's motivated not only by some sort of spiritual hunger or sense of deprivation, but also by a rather sharply attuned sense of social justice and her own developing political world. And she's been agonising with this decision for several years. Uncle Willie we knew him as. He was my, my great-uncle. He was referred to in my family as Mad Uncle Willie. He, having made this break with his family over religion, he was also very strongly Ireland for the Irish which wasn't his background, it wasn't the Anglo-Irish standpoint and I think that was a massive rift then. So, Violet's brother Victor went to the Boer War, he was extremely enthusiastic about it, he went and raised a group of friends and other aristocrats, they all went out together, they trained together, they paid their own way to go out there. But it was extremely unsuccessful. They had very traumatic times there. They were captured and I think there was great anxiety would they come home at all. Open O Ye Heavenly Gates leading to a false Jerusalem and it's devastating for Violet in particular having suffered the initial concern about her brother in 1901, 1902, when he was sort of effectively disappears as a prisoner in the Boer War. Mussolini's father is a Socialist, an anti-clerical. He's called Benito Mussolini after Benito Juárez, the famous Mexican revolutionary leader. But also the influence of his mother who was a Catholic, he understood Catholic Italy. The other important element of his youth that I think one would have to highlight is his move into exile. He went outside Italy, he went to the fringes of Italy in Switzerland and in Austrian Italy and looked back on Italy from there and it was that which encouraged him to use the language of Socialism, of class struggle as his initial stepping stone into politics. "My dearest father. I am also very grateful for the little fortune you have given me, as it makes me completely independent." He didn't leave his fortune to his heir who was Willie, but he left it to my grandfather Edward who's the next son. So that Willie, in effect, was disinherited, although he inherited the Baron title. But it was... it showed how big that rift had been. The political rift and the religious rift had really torn the family apart. The following year, he plays a huge role in fundraising for the purchase of the German guns that Erskine and Molly Childers and Mary Spring Rice then bring into Howth on Asgard and these of course are the guns that are going to be so prominent in the Easter Rising in 1916. Despite being very ill herself, having just been diagnosed with something called Paget's disease, a form of cancer, she also has appendicitis, peritonitis and, you know, when the surgeons open her up, they cannot believe the sepsis in her intestine. She's in a terrible way. She's fizzing with infection. And in fact at that point Scotland Yard open a file on Violet, having discovered that she's on a list of the delegation that wanted to go to the Women's International Congress and note that she's a Pacifist and sort of patsy for German propaganda. But despite that, she commits herself to propagandising against the war. She goes to Paris and volunteers for a unit putting out, you know, peace propaganda. She's simply not well enough to participate fully in any of these things. But of that 1915, 1916 is the period where she falls into the arms of this Father O'Fallon who actually provides an answer. He simply says, "You follow the Jesuitical regime, the praxis of St Ignatius Loyola and you will find an escape from yourself." And we know that Violet is attached to this idea of a passion story as a personal journey of her own and to the idea of some ultimate Calvary for herself because of the message she's taken from Father O'Fallon in her Jesuitical retreat and through the spiritual exercise and through his continuing influence on her. If you can die unto yourself and release yourself from these mundane earthly physical problems is an absolutely bonkers thing to say to a woman like Violet who is manifestly physically ill and frail. This is not somatic, I mean she is, she's very seriously ill. For many periods in her life but particularly when she meets him. Mussolini fights the First World War as an ordinary soldier. It's very important. He might have wanted to be an officer but he wasn't allowed to be. In 1917, he leaves the front. He's wounded in a training accident, a grenade accident and the rest of the war he's licensed really by the government to continue writing in his newspaper and to be a propagandist, and because he continues to write columns for his newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia - The People of Italy - this left-wing Nationalist newspaper that he set up in Milan and which continues to appear during the war, he expresses all that in articles. In fact he constructs a persona and he constructs a voice for himself. Victor, despite the trauma that he must have suffered in, in the Boer, during the Boer War, kind of repeats the exercise at the beginning of the First World War. There are a wave of strikes and bitter battles in the factories and peasants and landless labourers, particularly in Central Italy, in Mussolini's own region, Emilia-Romagna, take the land, they seize the land. Three-quarters of a million peasants, in fact, form a trade union and they take the land and start dividing it up or farming it co-operatively. The power of the Fascists begins to establish itself at a local level. They form violent squads and they move into the factories and in particular they move onto the land on behalf of the local landlords and they suppress the social movements of the post-war period. The old liberal elites are desperately seeking for something to buttress them against the forces of this popular Catholicism and the Socialists. And who do the appeal to? They appeal to the squads at the local level and they appeal to the Fascists as they're now calling themselves when it comes to elections. Victor's death goes off under Violet like a bomb. The first she hears of it is in the evening paper in London. She's in very minimal contact with her family at this point. We talk about social media now but in fact news travelled so fast in those days that it was often something... you would read of a death of a parent or a family member through the newspapers. He's found one day in the armchair of a pub in Horsham, Surrey, and he's dead. And it's not clear if he's taken his own life but he was said to be very thin, malnourished and had only three shillings in his pocket. It's a sort of desperate end for this dashing young man who'd lost all sense of purpose as a result of war. And it makes Violet of course into an ardent pacifist. After Victor dies and she has a nervous breakdown, and that's the first time we find her committed. And Violet's reaction to this was to go really quite sort of bonkers. She goes and attacks somebody in South Kensington who she possibly thought was an intruder, it's not clear, but she does draw a knife. She's kind of lost it at this point. She's overwhelmed with grief and shock and the sheer exhaustion of her long years of physical illness and she's committed. And this is Violet's first and sadly not her last encounter with the lunatic asylum. "This is Italy in 1922. These marching men are charter members of a new Italian political party - the Fascists - founded and led by a flamboyant ex-editor, ex-army corporal, ex-Socialist Benito Mussolini. Fascism has been Mussolini's dream for seven years. Now the march on Rome. His movement numbers a million members including uniformed Blackshirts and Mussolini successfully forces his leadership on the Italian King and people. In the afternoon of October 28th 1922, in a downpour of rain, Mussolini himself arrives. Despite the fact that 80% of Italians still support the constitutional monarchy, his threats of violence and revolution win him the office of premier." He was a very, very astute manipulator. So, he would use the violence of other people without necessarily endorsing it. He would set people in rivalry against each other and out of that, as I say, not quite the puppet master but the master impresario. He was able to co-ordinate this emerging and increasingly powerful Fascist movement. And at the same time he was singular. He was Il Duce. There was only one leader and that was the way of framing the notion that the state was hierarchical. The society was hierarchical and everybody looked to this figure who then of course was reproduced in film and in photographs and so on. Politicians and, you know, high society, were all seeking him out and saying how wonderful he is. All the women adore him. He's got this amazing sort of outdoor physique, drawn by these wonderful sort of macho poses of Mussolini in photographed fencing or boxing or riding or bare-chested, scything the corn in the fields glistening with sweat. I think there were 2,500 poses but about 30 million photographs of those poses reproduced and circulating in Italy. But Fascism in return gave to the Papacy what it had long wanted and that was the Vatican as an independent state within Rome. But it was a deal which certainly left dissident Catholics, other Catholics like Violet Gibson who may have had their own contentions with the Papacy out in the cold. Giacomo Matteotti is one of the principal critics of Mussolini after the victory in the April 1924 elections. He also has powerful international connections including with the Independent Labour Party in London who would publish a book of his which had appeared in Italian denouncing the Fascist violence in the elections. He also has inside information apparently on a secret deal between Sinclair Oil, an American oil company and the Fascists, giving backhanders in exchange for a monopoly of oil distribution in Italy. He's driven down the Tevere in Rome. He's stabbed, he's sexually assaulted, the ultimate degradation and insult. And then his body's taken about 12 kilometres outside the city and dumped where it's left to rot. It's not discovered in fact until August. And it's an absolutely shocking moment. I think when she leaves London, she is preparing for the assassination of Mussolini. She left in November 1924, very suddenly, and she took with her a sort of a hapless sweet woman called Mary McGrath from Co. Meath who I imagine she might have known as a servant or a relation of some of the servants that the Ashbourne family had in Dublin perhaps, and McGrath, ever kind, ever faithful, joins her and is with her right through this passion story as it begins to unravel. I think when she leaves London in 1924, the murder of Matteotti is uppermost in her mind. The idea that she can avenge it by assassinating Mussolini, I think that's forming in her mind at the time. She certainly intends some great grand gesture because she packs a gun in her luggage, a small revolver. She'd been in doubt when she left London. I think this is the time where it crystallises in her head, in her mind that it's Mussolini who needs to be taken out. Mussolini is the killer of Matteotti, he is the sponsor of the squadristi, these Italian Fascist squads. "On his first anniversary, with the aid of gunfire, kidnapping and castor oil, he is absolute dictator. Italians must call him Duce." And we find her in this period, 1924, '25, right up until March '26 going to Trastevere a lot. And Trastevere at that time was one of was a very, very poor working class district of Rome. English guidebooks advised tourists not to go anywhere near it and you were likely to be, you know, murdered, raped and robbed in that order or the other way round. So, she goes and she was taking little envelopes and preparing them with bits of money to give as alms to poor people. But this clearly had become a sort of ritualised journey for her to go to Trastevere, so the Socialist Christian mission, that's the most obvious place she would go to carry out looking after the poor and giving alms. But Trastevere is important for another reason. It's where what's left of the underground political opposition to Mussolini is. It's the place where opponents of Fascism are gathering around, various characters, one's called Ernesto... Father Ernesto Buonaiuti and he's a well-known Italian Catholic Modernist, connected to Willie Ashbourne, her brother, and no doubt introduced to her by Willie and it's known that, police records show - because he was under surveillance - that he was having meetings, clandestine meetings and that Violet Gibson was also attending. So, we have a link there. We have the Matteotti trial and we have Trastevere as two sort of hotbeds if you like of the secret and ever-receding in terms of visibility opposition to Mussolini. If Violet's intention in going to Italy with a revolver is to shoot Mussolini, say, she, she falters in 1925, in February, just four months after she's arrived. She decides that perhaps the sacrifice that's required of her is a different one. And she locks herself in her cell, if you like, in the convent where she's staying. (GUNSHOT) Violet has got herself into bed and held a sheet and wore her modesty to her chin but it's noticed that some blood is coming out of the corner of her mouth. And amazingly, the bullet enters her ribcage and sort of ricochets around and ends up in her shoulder, but other than that, she sustains no real injury. She's taken in and the bullet is removed. A statement is made to the police who confiscate the gun, crucially. She now has no gun and a priest is sent to hear her confession. I suppose you've come to take me out of here? Yes, dearest. I am not suggesting... At least consider London. We could... The family would... The atmosphere in these places is not conducive... You don't seem to realise, Willie, I'm with the nuns here. Without the nuns... You must try to re-enter real life. Real life? Really, Willie? Might I remind you, you, you led the way. I'm not talking about your faith. No. You're not. Willie obviously didn't see it in the same way. I think he probably just thought she was mad and so he left when she'd refused to come back with him and that was the last she ever saw of him. Although they had been very, very close. He'd been a major influence on her life and on her conversion to Catholicism. "In the event of my death, or that I am for some reason unable to transact my own affairs, will you please see that all my belongings, papers and notebooks are given to Miss Enid Dinnis, 36 Milton Road, East Sheen, London. Much love from your affectionate sister, Violet Gibson." Miss McGrath. Would you mind going to the dressmaker tomorrow to pick up my order? Is this a new outfit for a special occasion? No. But I... I do need a day quiet and alone. She's now a woman alone with her Irish maid who she keeps by the way giving excuses to and saying, "I'll be back in a minute," and then she just goes off. She's very good at escaping, Violet, at evasion in all senses of the word. And McGrath was rather desperate because she doesn't, can't account for her and she knows she's meant to be looking after her. In these periods she's going to Trastevere, we know that for sure. Where else would she have got hold of a gun, a second gun? She's got to have got that in Italy somewhere. Very hard to get an unlicensed gun, any gun at all in Fascist Italy. It's not like someone sent it to her in the post from England. She wouldn't have brought two guns out with her. I'm absolutely convinced that the second gun, the one that she's going to turn on Mussolini, she gets from the circle of Ernesto Buonaiuti or somebody else in Trastevere. And I think they, they put her up for it and she's very much up for it. I'm sorry to say but I have no further need for your services. Why, Miss Gibson? Did, did I do something wrong? No. Absolutely not. And I must ask you not to disclose this matter to anyone or disclose anything about your dismissal. Can you promise me that? Thank you. I've made all the arrangements for your travel back to Ireland on Monday. On, on Mon... on Monday? Yes. Is there any... are you sure... is there anything I can do? Thank you, Miss McGrath. You may go now. "Mussolini. Domani. Piazza del Littorio. (CROWD MURMURING) (CHEERING) (MUMURING CONTINUES) Il Duce! Il Duce! Il Duce! (CHEERING "IL DUCE" CONTINUES) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING "IL DUCE" CONTINUES) (FEINT SCREAMS) (YELLING) Everybody stay calm! Nothing! It will take more than this to finish Il Duce! Don't be afraid, my friends. I am here. I will always be here! This is a trifle, a mere trifle! (CAMERA CLICKING) She is completely calm having almost been lynched by the mob. She has had this great apotheosis; this great moment of success. She lies there like Prince Andre in "War and Peace" and looks up at the sky in a moment of great beauty and release. It's extraordinary. And meanwhile Italy just erupts, up and down the country. The facista squads are out beating up anyone they can find who seems a worthy target. Another response is of course in Thanksgiving and the tolling of the bells, the "Te Deum" is played, and various church bells and service is held in many churches. St. Mark's bells ring out in Venice; The Vatican rings out the bells of St. Peter's; The Pope sends a message saying how relieved he is Mussolini has been spared by God; protected by God. Telegrams come in from the president of the United States, from the Irish president, from Chamberlain obviously, from King George V, who says how appalled he is at this terrible thing. King George V, of course, who 30 years earlier has stood in the same photograph, just feet away from the young Violet Gibson who was then a beautiful debutant. Do you understand? Do you understand? Miss McGrath knew nothing. I dismissed her so that could not be implicated. As the person who tried to assassinate the Prime Minister of Italy you will face the full rigour of the law. Do you understand? Where did you get the gun? Who gave you the gun? You want to know where I got the gun? Well, I had an old friend in England who gave me the gun before he died. And I brought it with me to Rome. When she's imprisoned she's very calm and I think sort of satisfied. (RUSTLING/PAPERS SCRUNCHING) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) Chief Superintendent Pennetta is a fascinating character. He believes, he suspects, and then I really think he does believe after a period of time that Violet was part of a conspiracy. The Gibson family regrets the incident and expresses warm sympathy. I'm only surprised she shot Signor Mussolini given the fact that she repeatedly declared the desire to assassinate the Pope. Miss Constance Gibson arrived two days ago to represent the family. We have succeeded in inducing Ferry, one of the leading pathological lawyers in Rome, to undertake Violet Gibson's case. Miss Gibson was having such an awkward time here that she needed police protection. No hotel wished to give her accommodation,.. He insists on wearing a kilt on all occasions and as this particularity has been signalled in the press, he would run serious risk of being assaulted in the street. No one will know my judgement except myself. I will be silent. I love the Italians and hope they will allow me to stay with them and I hope everyone will be patient with me. Violet tries to get her... requests her checkbook from the convent and the inquiry reveals that she has an awful amount of money, a lot of money in her account and this must have been some part of a plot because why would she need thousands of pounds in today's terms in her account unless it were to promote some kind of conspiracy or something? And she said, "No, no, no," she writes an incredibly rational letter saying, "Well no, obviously not. It's what we call credit. I have 100 pounds a week on credit but it doesn't mean I'm going to spend 100 pounds a week." And Pennetta looks and that and says, you know, to himself In fact he notes it. "These are not the words of a woman who is insane. This is completely lucid and completely practical. She has, I think, mounting evidence, circumstantial that suggests to him that she's been part of a plot and the more I think about it the more I think she was. She's carrying that stone wrapped in a leather glove in her pocket when she goes to Campidoglio. She's got the pistol and she's got the stone. Would you think of that? I don't know, I wouldn't. I think that sounds like someone with some sort of vaguely professional idea of how to assassinate someone might have told her that. Where did she go? Who did she meet? Who are her accomplices? Do you expect me to believe this lady, this Irish lady, this aristocrat dreamed this up all by herself? She went and got a gun all by herself and there was no one behind her pulling the strings? Who were they? Who are they? You will of course be subject to the full rigours of the law. I am setting it out what it is we want to know. You will get her to give a full account of herself. Write her a letter. Is that clear? (BELL RINGING/FLAG WAVING IN WIND) Do you remember that you once asked me that I loved Rome more than you? You must know that at this moment nothing interests me more beyond helping you, if I am able. I'm taking this opportunity to ask you in the name of God that when you next see the magistrate, you are perfectly frank and answer all the questions he puts to you. This is in your interests and for your own good. Miss Gibson, look at you. Miss McGrath! How are you? These are for you. How are you? What are you doing here in Rome? And how did you afford the trip? Don't worry, Miss Gibson, the Italian consul in Dublin, they offered to pay for a first class return ticket. The Italian consul? The other day I met with your sister Frances, Mrs. Bolton, at her home in Dublin. She's very concerned about you. Frances? Concerned? I doubt that. And your dear friend Enid, she has been... She has been writing and asking about you. How is Enid? She's good but she's very worried about you. Everybody is worried about you. Look at your face. I hate this place. It does get terribly lonely. Are you eating? Are you eating properly? The food here is terrible. The visit is over. Andiamo! No I have to... Please come back again soon, Miss McGrath. I will, I promise. I promise. Come back soon. She said to the mother superior, I think, at St. Brigida, before she set... a few days before she set out to kill Mussolini, she said, "I've been asked by several people, four people, have told me to do it but I don't know if I'm up to the task; I don't know if I'm up to it." Why did I shoot Mussolini? Well, I did it for love. When I arrived in Rome in 1924,.. ..I learnt to my great sadness that Geovanni, Geovanni Colonna, Duca di Cesarò,.. ..was married. I wanted to do something to impress him. So, I had heard that he had become an opponent of the fascist regime, so I decided to kill Mussolini. Of course he knew nothing of my plans. That's all I'm prepared to say at the moment. I'm tired and I would like to return to my cell. She plays poor Pennetta and the others who come to interrogate her. "Who, me? Are you sure? I shot Mussolini? I don't think so." And the next day she's saying, "Ah, yeah, no, I did, I did. I did it. Why? I did it for the glory of God." "Did you have any accomplices?" "I did, I did," she'd say, I had, I had all the great saints who've died guiding me. I met Geovanni, the Duke... He approached me and said, "Great things tomorrow". And then she writes at some point to her friend Enid Dinnis, she does write a letter saying, "I'm so glad God gave me an Irish tongue... ..to lead them all a merry dance. Viva Mussolini! Viva Mussolini! It is against the will of God that Mussolini should continue to exist. At this point she got her room and it's a rather nice newly opened asylum up in the hills above Rome and allowed a certain degree of freedom. She said to one of the nuns there that she had people who had helped her, but that she would always remain silent about it so as not to compromise them. We have the preliminary details. Name: Violet Albina Gibson. Una metro, cinquantasette centimetri. Left breast amputation. She'd subjected to, I'd say, a really intrusive - given the context - examination. What could it possibly have justified? Finding the seat of her hysteria, literally, touching her womb? This is something I find very uncomfortable talking about and I find incredibly uncomfortable reading the details of this vaginal examination. The hymen is not intact. It permits with ease the introduction of two exploratory fingers. The uterus is retroverted. Ovaries normal. There is no pathological secretion of the urethra even after it is squeezed. I think for a woman who was so resolutely private and who was effectively living as a celibate - although she'd had lovers when she was younger - this must have been... this must have felt like a punishment. It must have been very humiliating and I think that's what it was intended to be. When Lucetti misses, she confides to the same nun after that. She says that it was a pity he missed. The nun then reports of her to the investigating magistrate and he demands she be taken straight back to prison. She knows she's made a mistake because she's then in floods of tears for days afterwards and really shaky. Violet's eyes, which were shown in close-up in newspapers all over the world, including the Daily Mail, were, without comment, were simply presented as evidence of a depraved personality of a mad woman with malicious intent. It's not surprising Ferri comes up with this defence of lucid insanity. Basically a deal was done. Ferri, who I'm sure enjoyed going through the motions because Violet Gibson was a fascinating objective study as was Mussolini who he'd also studied, Ferri was given the nod that Mussolini wanted this over with as soon as possible and he wanted Violet spirited out of the country. This coincides with perfect timing with Winston Churchill - then chancellor's - visit to Rome to meet Mussolini and of course Churchill comes out and gives Mussolini the great bona fides of the recuperative leech who will draw the Bolshevik threat away from Italy and by implication, the rest of the free world. The Italian bit of this story ends with this much quieter piece of theatre but it is nonetheless a piece of theatre. When, essentially, people in disguise as civilians but are in fact Violet's future custodians, they're nurses and attendants from St. Andrew's Lunatic Asylum and plainclothes policemen, you know, she's surrounded by people who then spirit her onto this train and I'm absolutely sure she had no idea who they were other than he own sister Constance. Can you believe it, Constance? I'm going home. I won't be staying here long. I will be returning to Italy as soon as possible. Why? To shoot Mussolini. Miss Gibson, I concur with my colleague. You behaviour is hysterical and suspicious, unbalanced and unreliable. Doctor! My behaviour since the incident... Even unstable and dangerous. My behaviour since the incident, all of it, has been conducted with the view to preparing my defence of insanity after I attacked Mussolini. I'm sorry. I cannot see it. That is not my diagnosis. (BIRDS CHIRPING/LEAVES BLOWING) (STEPS CREAKING) And of course there's the reveal, isn't there? There's the reveal when she's finally dumped at St. Andrew's. Is that when the nurses take their civvies off? I don't know, they already changed into their uniforms and their starched collars. I'm not sure. It's a great deception that get's her back without any sort of protest. But it's a story full of theatricality. Some of it hysterical and melodramatic and other a little bit more subtle and oblique and causes one to think more about the destiny of the protagonist of this story. (HEAVY BREATHING) The world feels less and less like a home. Good morning, Miss Gibson. Good morning, Miss Clarke. It's a beautiful day, Miss Gibson. I heard the blackbirds singing on my way over this morning. I was thinking about you. You have such an extraordinary way with the birds. Maybe you can go to the garden today. I do hope so, Miss Clarke. This room is so stuffy at night. It's bad for my chest. I have had tuberculosis, you know. I need fresh air. I'm going to write to Dr. Tennent to ask him that my windows be left unlocked at night as they were previously. Even the junior nurses have their windows unlocked at night. And why not I? Who am methodical and careful. I'll see what I can do, Miss Gibson. Thank you, my dear. "I was alone with her for an hour and a half and I wondered suppose she was to attack me or my sister Lady Bolton, seize our coats and hats, whether or not it would have been perfectly easy for her to walk out." Out! Out! Devil! Out! Get out! It's done! Get out, devil! Get out! Get out! Get out! Stop, Violet. Stop. It's only a dream. It's the devil. It's that devil. It's that devil. He won't leave me alone. He won't leave me alone. He won't leave me alone. My dear Constance, once again I have seen the devil and was so mad last night they had to put me in a padded cell. Will you forgive me and come and take care of me as I should have let you done in the beginning. Please be very forgiving and come as soon as you can. With love, from Violet Gibson. My dearest Enid, My protestant sisters have taken charge of my affairs and sent me to an asylum where there is no chapel, not even for Sunday Mass and where obviously I cannot receive communion. I feel that I have no friends. I don't know if there is still anybody who loves me. Help me to understand my situation. (KNOCKING) Oh my God! (HEAVY COUGHING) Hello? Violet, it's me, Constance. I don't want to see you. I don't want to see you or anyone. But my dear Vizzie, I've come all the way to see you. Just go away, Constance. I don't want to see you. Please! Leave me alone. It was Constance who would go and visit Violet when she was in this mental hospital for the rest of her life. The rest of the family didn't go and see her. Possible one sister visited once. But it was Constance who went I think every month to see her and was in correspondence with the hospital all the time and was looking out for Violet, and doing her best for her. She survived and at times she made the best of it and she was calm and at peace and was given certain privileges. She could go out and feed the birds. I think she was please she had arrived to the point through patient waiting where the birds were feeding on her hand. I think she was also kind of slightly flattered that this put her into the same kind of iconography as the saints, like St. Francis. Your paper, Miss Gibson. Thank you. It's not really until 1935 that you hear the British press or the English-language press this includes the Americans, in 1935 when Mussolini invades Ethiopia. Abyssinia. It's not really until then that it ever enters the minds of British diplomats that Mussolini might be a danger to others. "To acts of war, we will reply with war." In a brutal war in Abyssinia in which mustard gas was used, there is there, I think no doubt that fascist imperialism was, well let's put it this was, amongst the worst of the variants of European imperialism in Africa. By 1938, the student Hitler has (inaudible) the teacher Mussolini. But Il Duce has given Italy's king and queen a temporary Ethiopian empire and together with Hitler, has helped spread fascism to Spain as well. Single-handed, he defies the League of Nations and gets away with it. Now all Europe trembles at the sound of the Axis goosestep which Il Duce in compliment to Hitler has introduced among his own troops. As world war seems inevitable, England and France sign peace commitments with the Axis at Munich, September '38 on the Axis's own terms. Definitely the junior part of the Axis, Mussolini still has a whip hand over Chamberlain and Daladier. He's welcomed home from Munich. New year he overruns Albania. A year afterward, with France defeated and England tottering, he takes Italy into World War II. Dear Mr. Churchill. In 1926, I tried to assassinate Mussolini. One year's internment would have been ample for that. But because I hung myself three times, and because for every two years I can be kept here, 1000 pounds clear profit is made and because I have a family of the plausible cat species, I have not been set free. The war situation is great. I hope you will prove yourself to be a Prime Minister equal to dealing with it, and so, easing the gratitude of the whole world. Yours sincerely, Violet Gibson. (BIRDS CHIRPING) It's so wonderful to get out into the fresh air. Even if I'm confined to this garden. I don't think anyone cares about me. I've been tossed aside. Oh, Vizzie. You know that's not true. In all these years Willie never came to visit me. And I wasn't allowed to go to his funeral either. And as for the others... But I come to visit. I do so care about you, Vizzie. I know you care. But in a strange way. Why can't I go to a convent where I can be looked after and where I can find peace? Oh, Vizzie, please don't be troubling yourself. Good morning, Miss Gibson. How are you this morning? Now very well, Miss Clarke. Oh, are you ill? No... My nephew has taken on responsibility for my affairs. And it seems my family can no longer afford for me to stay in a private room. With my own nurse. And I may need to move to the dormitory. I am sorry to have to tell you... ..that I will be leaving this hospital soon to take up another position. Oh no. More bad news. I will miss you. You have been very kind to me. You are indeed a special woman. I should not be locked up and buried alive in this evil place. Miss Gibson, this is not an evil place. You are not evil. But this place is. Hitler's boyfriend, the deflated Mussolini was carted off to Germany by plane following his rescue by Nazi paratroops. Captured enemy films show how after being kept a prisoner in Central Italy he was whisked off to become a Nazi stooge. At Hitler's headquarters the comedy of errors reached a peak of buffoonery as Muso tried oh so hard to look his former self in front of Mr. Schicklgruber. A kiss for papa. Mussolini's son who is with the Nazis held back on a crack about how well he thought he looked and the fraudulent head of a fake fascist regime shook hands with Ribbentrop. What a parody of those former meetings. One arrogant career which has hit the ignominious bottom. Yes, there you have them: Hitler, Ribbentrop and the flat tyre. However, the Germans occupied Italy down to Rome and remained in possession and so the last two years of the war the Allies slogged there way up Italy and behind the lines an Italian civil war broke out between the partisans, the resistance and the supporters of the fascist regime. The fascist and his mistress are displayed. The degraded Duce is spurned in death by raging people and the place from which he launched the march on Rome. The world will not forget the life and death of Benito Mussolini, the strutting, pompous braggard. Now the one time Duce has been executed and his body spat upon by his countrymen. An example other war criminals will not overlook. He's fleeing from the partisans who will eventually shoot him and hang him and Clara like prosciuttos at the petrol station in Milan. In his bag he's carrying files relating to the Violet Gibson case, which I can only assume the only use of that would be as a bargaining chip to say "I did you guys a favour." She wanted to go to a convent, somewhere by the coast. She wasn't fit enough to jump over walls and assassinate people. She was no risk to anybody. Of course she wasn't. And of course those wishes were never granted. One remembers that what seems long, long ago, people spoke well of one and loved one, whereas in these days one is held is such derision that it requires a strong act of faith to believe that anyone ever did love one. (STRUGGLED BREATHING) I found these letters that she'd written to the Queen, to other notables, anyone she could think of, mentioning her father, mentioning her time at court when she was a young woman trying to use the social credentials that she shared actually and had been so oppressive to her, now to trying to use them to get... secure her release. But the devastating thing is if the letters are still in the file in the envelopes with the stamp on, they were never sent. She really was silenced and buried alive. The end of this black and white movies, turning into colour, finished,.. I'm happy that it's not. Because I think in oblique and sometimes... ..troubling ways, the story of Violet, the question of her madness and/or at the same time sanity... ..asks us to present different ways into a much bigger history of violence, of fascism, of international politics, of politicking as some kind of grand parlour game. These smaller characters who get these marginal parts and appropriate to marginal parts are then marginalised. They do actually shine and sparkle in the margins and tell you something the official histories have left out, which I think is of value. I think her life is of value and needs to be... That needs to be recovered. For her but for us, for now. Because it tells us a lot of what's going on now.
