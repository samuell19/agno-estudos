So, I mean, as much as I can see the benefits, I just really like living in a heated apartment. (both laughing) - Well, I'll overlook the attitu but I am offering you an opportu - Um, yeah. I mean, I can see how dealing with clients and practicing my surgical skill could definitely be advantageous - Good. That's the kind of attitude I'd like.

So you'd be doing things like wa and cleaning instruments, et cet - Okay, so if that's the case, why don't I just apply for the ACA position? - I think it's preposterous for a trained doctor of veterinary medicine, such as yourself, to be working as an animal care (soft music) (Laura sobbing) ♪ Runs toward the sidewalk ♪ ♪ His crippled hands ♪ ♪ Still clutch the bottle ♪ ♪ It takes a drink ♪ ♪ Forthright disciple ♪ ♪ And every night ♪ ♪ It's always seems ♪ ♪ It could have been worse ♪ ♪ It could've been better ♪ ♪ It could've been worse ♪ - [Jeremy] Oh, here, lemme help you with that. - Thanks.

Let me explain. - Go! (soft music) (people chattering) - Jeremy. Hey, man. What's up? - Hi. - Thanks for coming, brother. How you doing, man? - All right. How you doing? - Uh, not bad. You want a bong? - Uh, no thanks. No, I'm good. - Fuck. More for me, man. - Um, hey, is, uh, is Laura here - Who? Someone got a crush. - I, well, I didn't say that. All I did was ask if she was her - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. I haven't seen her, man. Speak of the fucking devil. Good luck, man. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? - Good. How you doing? - I'm good. Do you want a beer? - Yeah. Thanks. - Sweet. - So how's the party going so fa - Uh. It's all right. Uh, I called you earlier, but there was no answer. - Oh, I was probably in the shower or something. - Well, I, there's nothing impor - Okay. - I just wanted to know when you're gonna be here. - Well, I'm here now. So do you wanna go somewhere els - Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - Okay, let's go. - All right. So, uh, you come up here often? - Oh. When the mood strikes. Usually it's to get away from everyone and everything, but sometimes it's just to see t So who are you, Jeremy Miller? - What? - Who are you really? I feel like I don't know anything about you. - Well, what do you wanna know? - Anything really. I mean... I just... I don't know. You seem fascinati - Really? - Yes. But you also seem sad. - I seem sad? - Yeah. I can see it in your eye - Well, I'm fine. - You're lying. I can see it. Jeremy, just tell me whatever's on your mind. I swear, once you get it off you you'll feel so much better. - All right. The reason why I don't want to tell you certain things is 'cause I, uh, I really like you. - You really like me? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. - Good 'cause I was starting to think you were gay. - Why would you think I was gay? - Oh, Jeremy, come on. We're young, vibrant, enjoying this breathtaking view of the city. And you haven't even made a move Tell me something else. - The reason that I was in the h was because I, I tried to commit suicide. - You... Why? - I came home one day and I found her. Well, I, I found them. In bed together. - Who? - My fiance and my best friend. She was my whole life. And then she just took it all away from me. And I remember feeling so upset. Like, like I, I had all these different emotions going on in my head, but I couldn't cry. I just felt numb. One day it was just all too much And I broke down and I cried for hours I took as many pills as I could next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. - I swear there's a special plac for people like that. - Luckily Uncle Roger has been there the whole time. - What about your mom and dad? Where were they through all this - Well, my dad left when I was seven or, or eight. - And what about your mom? - Well, let's just say that she hasn't really been the best - I knew someone that committed suicide once. - Really? - Yeah. This guy that I dated, he called me out of the blue. He didn't have anything specific to talk about. He just kind of wanted to talk. I mean, I asked him if everything was okay, and he said he was fine. But a couple days later they found him in his car, um, and he had shot himself. So... Yeah. I mean, at some point you just g asking yourself why and you have to just get over it and move on, you know? - Are you over it? - Yeah. Yeah. I am over it. Are you over it? - Working on it.
