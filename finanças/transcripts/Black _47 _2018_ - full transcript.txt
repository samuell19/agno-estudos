[film roll reels] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] Alright. Come on then. [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] [sighs] No excuse tonight. It was your accomplices. I have no accomplices. Oh. I found the guns. If you don't cooperate, they'll charge you with treason. And I have no interest in seeing you punished unnecessarily. I sympathize with the Young Irelanders. No, you don't. You're a puppet of the crown. Yeah. Mm-hm. A subject. Loyal subject. So feck off back home to England then. I prefer here, Mr. McCormack, I find it challenging. There's no place now that you get someone to tell the truth. Or does England not want you anymore? [grunting] [panting] Accomplices? [choking] [panting] [intense music] [wheezing] [panting] [panting] Well, inspector has the prisoner been cooperative? Not really. No. [panting] He's dead. [dramatic music] [horse trotting] [speaking in foreign language] In the year of 1845 a terrible famine descended upon Ireland. Within a few short years one in four of our people would be gone forever. Fled to England and North America. Or dead from starvation and fever. Irishmen who had enlisted to fight for the occupying British crown in its foreign wars returned home to find only death and destruction in every corner of the land. [melancholic music] [chanting in foreign language] Seen by many as traitors to their own people they looked on helplessly as their country continued to choke under the rule of the British Empire. [sobbing] [music continues] [snorting] [horse snorts] Beartla O'Naughton. Martin O'Feeney. Where's my family? I'm sorry, Martin your mother died a year ago. Sick with the fever. [snorting] Where's my brother? Hanged. Stabbed the bailiff when they came to tumble the house. I couldn't help them. I had nothing. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [horse neighs] [speaking in foreign language] [coughing] [shushing] [wind howling] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [coughing] [speaking in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] [wind gushing] [instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] [instrumental music] [knock on door] This is the final order to vacate! This dwelling will be rendered uninhabitable. [speaking in foreign language] We are taking the roof off! [speaking in foreign language] For your own safety, come out now! [speaking in foreign language] [grunting] Are you comin' out? Sergeant. What's your business here? Tell your men to get off the roof. I'll pay whatever is owed. Not a question of money. The tenancy is illegal. They moved in from the side of the road. Move back, please. At least let them leave peacefully. How does this concern you? Let me talk to them. I won't ask you again. Stand down and let this men do their job. [speaking in foreign language] [shouting in distance] [grunting] Take that young man into custody. You little thief. No! Michael! [gunshots] [sobbing] [grunting] Michael! Get him out of here. [sobbing] That's his rifle. Here's his boots and his other stuff. Breach of the peace. Interfering constabulary business. Sergeant says find out who he is and where he got the weapons. [sighs] Name? Name? Go on, say it. Well, he can speak English, alright. [sighs] Army musket. Could be a deserter. [whistles] Huh? Where'd you get this then? [intense music] [grunting] The prisoner's lose! Get back down here! The prisoner.. [gunshot] What's going on down there? [gunshot] [shatters] Drop him! [groaning] Drop him! Put him down! [screaming] [grunting] No, please. [grunts] [panting] [dramatic music] [horse trotting] [music continues] [horse snorts] [wind howling] [heavy breathing] [music continues] [music continues] [heavy breathing] [dramatic music] [gate creaking] Inspector Hannah. [sighs] What would you say to a stay of execution? [indistinct yelling] [sighs] [exhales] We've received reports of a deadly attack on a Constabulary station in Connemara. On the estate of Lord Kilmichael. We believe this man, originally from the area may have been involved. One of our Connaught rangers. Declared absent without leave in Calcutta three months ago after breaking his commanding officer's jaw. I understand that you know him. That you served together in Afghanistan. That he is an effective soldier. He is. You'll be released to accompany Captain Pope to Ballybrack and to assist him in locating this Corporal Feeney. I'm retired from military service. Yeah, but you must agree that your particular expertise is better suited to this line of work. I do not agree. Might I remind you, inspector that you're no longer the decorated veteran the hero of the rank and file. You're an ineffective policeman. An embarrassment to the Irish constabulary. A hero who is about to be tried for the murder of the suspect McCormack for which you may be hanged. So think carefully. Are you agreeable? Remove the inspector's restraints. Find this man. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [instrumental music] [baby crying] [dramatic music] [pig grunting] [squealing] Ah, it is yourself. I'm glad to see they let you go. Will you have a drop? You will. To your poor mother. God have mercy on her. She was a stubborn woman who'd rather starve than take the soup. What could I do about that? "Just take it," I said to her. "Say what they want you to say." But she wouldn't. They'd torn the roof off the house. I thought it better to put an animal in it than to leave it idle. You know, your mother was a cousin of mine better to keep it in the family then let strangers get it. Much better. The judge, who hanged my brother.. ...what was his name? Bolton. I'd give anything to have them all back. Your mother, my brother. Michael. But I can't. [gun clicks] [gun cocks] [gun clicks] Damp day. You should have kept your powder dry. [gasps] [groaning] [train chugging] How far do you plan to travel, captain? As far as we need to. I'm compiling a report on the economics of famine in the west. Wexford Independent. Here. Free copy. "Galatians" chapter six, verse seven. I beg your pardon. "For whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap." Drunkenness and fecklessness is the economics of famine in the west. And the continued crop failure. Failures, sir, lies in the character of people. Explain your total dependence upon the easiest grown staple learned to mankind. [chuckles] Potato was the only way to feed so many over limited acreage. Food for the contented slave not the hardy and the brave. [exhales sharply] [intense music] Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. Hey, hey, hey. Shh-shh-shh. [horse snorts] [shushing] These will do fine. Thank you, lieutenant. Private, take Inspector Hannah to the stables. Give him whichever mount he chooses. Yes, sir. This way, inspector. So, that's the Hunter Hannah. In the flesh. Well, you need that kind of steel where you're going. They say you're after a ranger who's taken up with the Ribbonmen. I do not engage in idle gossip, lieutenant. Nor should you. Have the horses ready at dawn and your man in plain clothes. We don't want to attract any unnecessary attention do we? [indistinct chatter] Horik O'Se.. ...you stand accused of stealing a sheep from the estate of Lord Kilmichael. What say you? [speaking in foreign language] English is the language of this court, Mr. O'Se. How do you plead? [speaking in foreign language] Silence. Your Honor, the man was only trying to feed his children. He doesn't even speak English and it is the legal obligation of the court to pay for a translator. Where is the translator? Inability is one thing, this man's obstinate refusal to speak a language he clearly understand is another entirely. You leave me no option, Mr. O'Se. I find you guilty as charged and I hereby sentence you to six month hard labor followed by transportation.. [indistinct chatter] ...to Port, to Port Arthur, Van Diemen's Land seven years. Remove the prisoner. [clamoring] State your business. You hanged my brother? I did nothing of the sort. If I did pass sentence on this brother of yours I simply assessed the evidence and interpreted the law the constabulary hanged him. Indeed some might say that he hanged himself the day he choose to commit his crime. [instrumental music] Some might. I understand that may further bolster your sense of injustice to blame me for your brother's demise. But I do not cause the crops to fail and I am not responsible for people breaking the law. I'm merely a servant of the court. I bid you good day. [speaking in foreign language] [horse trotting] Good mornin', sir. Uh-huh. [exhales] What do you think you're doing? Private Hobbs is coming with us to serve as my orderly. And to tend to the horses. Time to earn that reprieve, inspector. [intense music] [indistinct chatter] Who do you think responsible, sergeant? Same Ribbonmen who burned down the constabulary station and killed six of my men. A magistrate will be a typical target for these Ribbonmen. What brings you here, gentlemen? We're compiling a report. May I enquire as the nature of this report? You may not. [instrumental music] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct singing] [rattling] [indistinct singing] [exhales] Was this Feeney? There was no robbery. [clears throat] Private, get outside and keep watch. [sniffs] What does this mean? [indistinct singing] What was this man's name? [indistinct singing] What's this man's name? They don't have the English. Do you know what happened here? [indistinct singing] Be quiet. Well? Well? [wind gushing] The body belongs to Beartla O'Naughton. Rent collector for Lord Kilmichael. Somebody came into his house and killed him. An unexpected end for the pig but he'll be ate all the same. We're looking for the Feeney house. There's the rest of him? He took over this holding when Mrs. Feeney was evicted. He learned that from the Ghilzai. Afghanistan. I've not yet had the privilege of foreign service Well that's their punishment.. ...for treachery. What happened to Mrs. Feeney? Without food or shelter.. ...she died. [instrumental music] He's headed west. I suppose we continue west. You'll need a translator. How much? How much have you? You should inform the constabulary. Our orders are clear, inspector we will not involve local authorities. Well, that was before we confirmed his identity we tell the police we prevent him killing again. Confirming Feeney as the killer does not complete our work. As you well know.

It's his land. [grunts] It's his grain. I have money. Can I help ye, gentlemen? We're looking for Mr. Cronin. The master's not here, sir. He left for town only a few moments ago.

Orders or not, I cannot allow the murder of a nobleman for lack of a warning. Send one of Cronin's servants to Carrick we'll stay on Feeney's trial. - Where does Kilmichael live? - London. But when he is here, the estate house. About days ride from here. Let's go straight to Kilmichael's. You're in no fit state, Mr. Hannah. I'll be the judge of that. Ah, Mr. Quinlivin. I wonder if it might be terrible inconvenience to you if we borrowed one of Mr. Cronin's horses. I'm afraid that would be quite impossible, captain. Well, you see, you see... I doubt that Mr. Cronin's family would condone of my supporting the men who failed to warn them that their husband and father was the target of a madman. Good day to you. [dramatic music] [horses panting] [music continues] [breathing deeply] [gun clicks] They sent you to get rid of me? Yeah. They can't afford to have one of their own someone they called a hero turn against them. They never called me a hero. Only you. I was just your faithful Mick. I was sorry they chose to see it that way. We did things for them that cannot be forgiven. And for what, when I come home to this? If I kill a man, they call it murder. If they do it, they call it war. Providence.. ...justice. Where will my family get their justice.. ...if not from me? Go home, English. You've got no business here. I won't be leaving here without you. Then you won't leave at all. [dramatic music] [breathing deeply] [instrumental music] What is all this? Kilmichael's put 50 guineas on Feeney's head. Is every half-wit in Ireland here? No, sir. Your mother went home yesterday. [men laughing] Home to London. [music continues] Your Lordship, Captain Pope of the 68th regiment. Your Lordship, I'm Captain Pope. I was sent here... His Lordship knows full well who you are, captain. What he does not know is whether this report you've been compiling will detail how you endangered his life withholding vital information as you did. Sir, you are in grave danger. We've managed this estate for 200 years. Do you think this is the first time our lives have been threatened? This is different. I have no intention of allowing some turncoat renegade ranger to dictate my itinerary. I have a dozen men to protect Lord Kilmichael. Poorly trained police are no match for this soldier. Another two dozen local militia. And who do they fight for? They fight for the bounty I've put on this ranger's head. We'll proceed as planned. I'll accompany the grain to town and from there, take the train to Dublin. You may join me if you wish. [donkey braying] Excuse me. Sorry, pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. What's goin' on, mate? Just scavengers, they go after the wagons. Hopin' for a bit of grain. Oh, where are they taking the grain? People are starving here. Boat to England. [speaking in foreign language] I think we are headed back to town, Mr. Conneely. Thanks for your help. The captain will pay you what you're owed. If it is all the same to yourself, Your Honor. I'd rather see it out. Why settle for a sovereign when there's a share of 50 guineas to be had. I beg your pardon, captain, but after all this trouble I'd like to witness this tale's conclusion first-hand that it might be accurately retold in the future. [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] [indistinct chatter] You better come quick! - Drop your weapon! - Open the gates. I'm not gonna tell you again. Drop your weapon, or you will be shot. Hobson, what the hell are you doing? I can't have it, sir. Look at all those people, look. They're fuckin' starvin'. Put down your gun! This is your last warning. Everyone's dyin' of hunger and they're porting food on a boat. Open the gates now. Private, lower your weapon. Not till we feed these people. Court martial me, sir. Do whatever you want with me but not till those people are fed. Please, son, put down the gun. And I don't give a damn what you think about either, Mr. Hannah. This is pointless, it won't change anything. It will. I can help these people. [gunshots] [screams] Sorry about your man, sergeant. I was talking to him! The boy lost his mind. You couldn't keep him in check so Sergeant Fitzgibbon did. He was a danger to us all. He shot an unarmed constable. I only followed His Lordship's orders. That seems accurate. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] Well, then, captain, any sign of our assassin? If not, does this mean I wonder that you've lost your man and that your mission is a failure? When I inherited this estate from my father it was practically bankrupt. To clear the land was the only solution. Consolidate the holdings, graze not grow reduce this ridiculous tax that I must pay per occupant. I don't need them, I don't want them, why should I pay for them? This potato business is simplified matters considerably. There are those who look forward to the day when a Celtic Irishman is as rare in Ireland as a Red Indian in Manhattan. [chuckles] I take no pleasure on it. Would you stop worrying, man? There's hardly a soldier alive who could get close enough to get a shot through this gap. Security is assured. [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [dogs barking] [dramatic music] [men laughing] The farmer goes into the bath and he sees the old squire straddling his eldest daughter. Well, he's furious and he lets out a shout.. "For God sake, Mary! "Arch your back like a good gal and keep the gentleman's balls out of the muck." [laughing] [coughing] Everything's in, My Lord. We'll lock up the exits, and I'll see you in the morning. [laughing] Thank you, sergeant. You know, Conneely.. ...I love this country. What's left of it? The scenery. You peasants are all the same, no appreciation of beauty. Beauty would be held in much higher regard, sir if it could be eaten. Well said. I say one more, shall we? That we shall, sir. Speaking of beauty this one could almost be English. - Uh.. - Hair! Her skin, fine bosom certainly head and shoulders above any of the miserable hags on the estate. Take the prettiest English maiden.. ...put her for one season in an Irish cabin.. Yes? Feed her water and potato, dress her in rags and make her wade through bogs and sleep with the family pig. Take from her any hope that the future will be different and when she crawls out of her hovel stretching out her scrawny hand for a penny.. ...how much will she look like that pretty English maiden? [chuckles] One might be inclined to speculate that you've lost your passion for this mission, inspector. Hmm. I still have a few ideas about how to apprehend Feeney.. ...but I need to know you're with me. Yeah. Time to turn in. [dramatic music] [music continues] [snoring] [indistinct chatter] [grunting] [groaning] [door unlocks] [music continues] I got you, you bastard. [gunshot] Aah! Hey! [Pope grunting] Well done, Hannah. Let him have it. [Pope panting] Shoot him, inspector. [dramatic music] [grunts] Aah! Get your hands off of me! [music continues] [woman screaming] Shoot the bastard! Aah! [panting] Shite. Do you intend to try to teach me some sort of lesson? Or to torture me? I assure you I'll give you no satisfaction. [speaking in foreign language] I won't beg. [speaking in foreign language] What do you say? I don't understand that aboriginal nonsense. Speak English, man! [speaking in foreign language] Speak English! [speaking in foreign language] [Hannah grunting] [panting] [coughing] I'll rip your goddamn throat off. [grunting] Who is he working with? [choking] Don't bother threatening him, sergeant. [grunts] [heavy breathing] Mr. Hannah doesn't have anything left to lose. Now that he's committed a treasonous act. [panting] How long have you been working together? Since the beginning? [heavy breathing] Where is he now? Shall I get the whip? He won't talk. [dramatic music] He's out there somewhere, and we have to find him quickly. Each of you, take four men from outside the gates. Search the area. Run! [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [bell tolling] Make ready! Present! [intense music] [gunshot] Take cover! Ahh! [dramatic music] [neighs] Sergeant! Who's firing on you? The man on the roof in the west, sir! You men, with me. Hey! It's Feeney. It's Feeney! [indistinct chatter] Open fire! [gunshots] Who gets the 50 guineas? Hold those men back! [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] [groaning] - Close those gates. - Close the gate! Reload your weapons. Where is Mr. Hannah? Secure the prisoner. [dramatic music] [groans] [clamoring] [grunts] [groans] [crowd clamoring] [gunshot] [crowd clamoring] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [indistinct chatter] [gunshot] He's here!
