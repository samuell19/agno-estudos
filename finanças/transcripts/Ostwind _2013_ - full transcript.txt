He really is her direct descendant? As Halla's great-grandson he has all her talents. But I'd hate to sell him, he's unpredictable. - That's what everyone said about Halla. He's been nothing but trouble. I know what I'm doing. Let's hope so. Right then, I'll send for the transporter. Well, let's go. WINDSTORM Mika! Wake up. You can start dreaming tomorrow. - Right. Freedom, here we come. Don't worry. You're exactly between grades. I checked it again. Besides, he said you're chances were good, right'? - True. What's that'? Change of style. Style baboon-ass? Mika, watch out! Excuse me? Please. HAPPY SUMMER HOLIDAYS Christian, thumbs down. Fanny, good work. Keep it up. Mika Mika, Mika, Mika! They say the apple never falls far from the tree, but in your case it hit another continent. - But you said my chances were good! Not so much anymore Charlotte, great work! Happy summer holidays! At least a C in Religion! If I was only good at something! You're good at a lot of things. - Like what? Yes? Thanks. I feel a lot better! I'm just not good when put on the spot. I think camp might be off. - What? We've been looking forward to it for months! Oh, how unfortunate! Due to a fire in the teachers' lounge grades won't be announced until after the holidays. At least I have solutions. I'm packing. With or without you. - Fanny! Help! Fire Help! Good afternoon. Is this your daughter's? REPORT - MIKA Arson is a serious warning sign, he said, especially with underachievers. Underachiever, my daughter! - At least the teacher was cooperative. She can retake the exam and if we cover the damage, there'll be no proceedings. - It was an accident! Sit down. - We can't cancel the conference, you're the main speaker. - But a summer camp hardly offers the peace and discipline required to study for an exam. - But you promised! You no longer have a say in this! Now what? Someone comes to mind. - What? No! Out of the question! Think about it: peace and discipline. Kaltenbach. We've made a decision. You'll spend the summer at your grandma's. - At the cemetery? You have another grandma. Yeah, "Moo!" So you're the arsonist from Frankfurt? You can call me Mika. Kaltenbach's granddaughter! Not quite like I imagined. These holidays aren't what I've imagined either. No use for that here. - We'll see. Only the latest technology! NO SIGNAL KALTENBACH ESTATE Do you have horses here? What made you think of that? No, no, he's doing with you whatever he wants. Legs up, and hands down, we're not fly-fishing here! - I'll try again. He just won't lift his legs. Not him, you! So you're Mika? Quite the rascal, so I'm told. You've grown. - Shrinking would have been weird. True. Shall I try the oxer again? No, let's finish for today. Sam, please show Mika her room. I'll see you at dinner. Try not to set fire to anything until then. You might want to change clothes. Change, why? Hello, horse. So, you're Mrs. Kaltenbach's granddaughter? - Yep. Mika. You? What class? - Eighth grade no, seventh. Lap of honor. Which jumping class. Oh, I see! CNR. CNR? - Can Not Ride. " Well then enjoy Kaltenbach. Who wants to unsaddle him? - Can I? Me, me! You coming'? I don't have all day. That was after her Olympic victory. She still holds the record to this day. My grandmother? - Yes! Mrs. Kaltenbach is I mean, was a world-class show-jumping rider. The boots will go to her successor. - Sounds like Cinderella. Come on, Mrs. Kaltenbach doesn't like tn be kept waiting. Cozy. So how was your trip? - Good. Good. Did you have to change trains often? - Once. Good. Thank you. You must be starving - Yes, I am. Hey, can't sleep either? Had bad luck with your food, too? Hey! What did you do to him? - Don't worry, he's just drugged. Is she hurt? - No, she's fine. You could be dead! What's going on here? - That's what I'd like to know! It's your job to keep this stable locked! Wait she was in there? - I only fell asleep. You what? - I feel asleep, so what? Mika, this horse is dangerous. You were lucky nothing's happened. Sam, don't let her out of your sight again. I have to prepare the tournament. Very important for all of us. - He'll be back on his feet in an hour. Now off to your room and study. And don't walk out the door until Samuel calls for you, 90ў it? She only said, "Don't walk out the door... " You can't lock him up forever. He's an animal. You know that. It's only a matter of time until something happens. - I know. I don't understand myself. That horse took everything from me. Still - You have to make a decision. I'll call the Hungarian. - The Hungarian? Is that necessary? The tournament is in four weeks. He'll be here. He pays well and as you know we need every cent. - The Hungarian's worse than my syringe. Daddy, Daddy, Archibald ate an entire bucket of turnips, come, quick! Don't worry, he can take it, sweetheart. - With the bucket and all? With the bucket? That's different. I'm coming. This pony is driving me crazy! Fanny? Hey! How's your grandma's farm? Having fun feeding the pigs? - Not really. No pigs and I wouldn't call her grandma either. But he's your grandpa, right? - What? Who? This is not a phone booth, it's my front yard. Alright Mika? - See? Already hung up. I know you. - I doubt it. Gotta run. It was a pleasure. You're forgetting something. It's busted anyway. - Nothing is so broken that it can't be fixed. Where were you? Well, I was getting some air, stretching my legs, admiring the scenery. - You're lucky I didn't tell on you but if I get in trouble Relax! Won't happen again. So what do you guys do here all day? - Well, first a bit of wellness and then a run at the go-kart track Wow, a go-kart track? The tail must be unplaited. If I only knew what's wrong with him. Lame that he is. I have to fix that before the tournament. Maybe he's got Degenerative Suspensory Ligament Desmitis? Or Myositis? I have something. Here. Pepagon, Australian deep heat lotion. Dad gave it to me for Archibald. Put it on his fetlocks every night. But not too much or it'll burn. - Nonsense. He's just stubborn. Or he's scared of you. Who asked you? Nobody. It's just a feeling. Mind your own business, okay? What is it you did? You look terrible! Mika! Okay, that's enough. Mika! - What? Where are you going? - To him. I'll do that. - Why? Get it now? - Yes, he doesn't want to be locked up. You know nothing about horses, so stay out of it, okay? It's a waste of food, really, but someone wants to buy the beast. - Yes, the Hungarian. What, the Hungarian? How do you know? - Why? Who is he? You don't want to know. Come on. I'll be back. Dinner. - Shoes! Thanks. Won't you keep me company? I've got lots to do. Weird. Just what happened last night. Mrs. Kaltenbach's granddaughter fell asleep in the stables. Fell asleep, where? - In Windstorm's stable. Right next to him. Do you know what that is? - Fool's luck? Nojrsodsh. "The Sleeper. " It's what the Mongolians called people who were born with the gift to understand the language of horses. One in a million - Grandpa, quit the fairy tales! Well, anyway. Good night. Quiet, or they'll hear us. Not too bad. You want out, right? Okay, but just for a bit. For a walk. Windstorm! Good morning. - Morning And, did they find him? No. It's all my fault. - That's right. If only I could help finding him. - Great idea. First you set him free, now you want to play tag! - We wanted to go for a walk. You know what? If you want to go for a walk, bring my grandpa his dinner. Okay. Archibald, what are you doing? Hello? It took me all morning to get him in here. Now he won't let me get closer than 3 meters. How did you know I'm here? - I didn't. He did. Was that your doing? We just wanted to go out for a stroll. Yeah well, he got his name for a reason. In the scriptures it says, "I saw a windstorm coming from the east, an immense cloud with flashing lightning, and there was a fire inside that cloud. " It's only a name. Wait. Stop, you can't go in there! They're coming. - No! Please don't! They'll lock him up. He can't take it anymore. They'll give him to the Hungarian. Thanks for calling. - We looked everywhere, but that the beast is hiding here - A horse is not a beast. Not like that. - It's the only way. I can see you made his acquaintance. I said, not like that. - Then how'? Don't be so stubborn. What if he hurts more than your arm next time? Fine, keep him until they come for him. I'm sure Mrs. Kaltenbach won't mind. I'm just not sure if you know what you're doing. No wonder Mrs. Kaltenbach fired you. Thanks! Mika? Yes? I'd like to talk to you. I shouldn't have left the door open. He just got spooked. - That's not what this is about. You're here because your mother asked me for something that's important to her, for some inexplicable reason. Exactly. It's important to her, not to me. I'm sorry Windstorm's run away. - Windstorm MY big hope. Halla was his great-grandmother. Halla'? Halla is a true legend. She carried her injured and almost unconscious rider to Olympic Gold. A unique horse with great talents. Windstorm has none of them. He's useless. - No, he's not! He's not useless just because he's not as fantastic as his parents. You locked him away. No wonder he won't do what you want! Your mother's right, you have a lot to learn. You know nothing about horses. You may have better luck in quantum physics once you stop reading upside down. But Windstorm - I never want to hear that name again! What did he do to you? Samuel? Mrs. Kaltenbach! I'd especially asked you to keep an eye on my granddaughter. I don't want her wandering about without supervision. Can I count on you? Yes, of course, Mrs. Kaltenbach. Absolutely. Serves you right. It's just not fair, four legs against two. I'll think of something. What, I have to go or I'll be in trouble. You already are. - What are you doing here? I'm to watch out for you. And what are you doing? - What? He's the most dangerous horse I know and you're playing tag as if he were a dog. He is not dangerous. He just needs someone to see him. Oh yeah? And how would you know? - I just do. He looks different. Happy somehow. She can't give him to this Hungarian. We have to talk to her. - She wouldn't even listen to us. Windstorm injured your grandma. Which is why she can't ride anymore. He could participate in the tournament. - The Kaltenbach Classics? And who's going to ride him? You'? Why not'? You can't ride. So what? I could learn. - Mika No one can learn how to ride a horse in four weeks. Even if, your grandmother would She'd kill us both! She doesn't have to know. Please! I just have to prove to her that he's not useless. Just look at him. Well, I only know one person who'd be crazy enough to take this on. No. - No? - No? And why not? Because I've sworn never to force a broken horse to do anything again. Great. Just a fairy tale after all. Come on. I thought nothing was ever so broken it couldn't be fixed. Can you tell me why he kicked me'? You were scared. And that scared him. He's like a mirror. Alright. See you tomorrow. He used to be a showjumping trainer. One of the best. Then he fell out with your grandmother. - What about? Her training methods. They could be tough, but that's what the sport is like. He says, she'd stopped listening to the horses. Whatever that means. Aren't you coming'? If anyone asks, you're in your room studying. - Thanks. I have really great news. Are you hitching up the carriage? What would I need as a beginner, hypothetically? I'd take a double-jointed snaffle bit. Jodhpurs and chaps can't do any harm. Here, you can have this one. Archibald always tries to bite it because he thinks it's a treat. Aren't you banned from the stables? I was supposed to - Bring Sam the stuff for the new student. Exactly! The double snif?e bat. Have a nice day. Look. As good as new, right'? I'm ready. The pants are too big, but I brought plenty of reins. We don't need them. Before a person gets on a horse he must master three things. First, balance. Second, rhythm. Third, coordination. And fourth - Fourth? You said three. Endurance. Once you master them all, we'll continue. Now you've got it! The most important thing between a rider and his horse is their relationship. A balance between trust and respect. You lead the horse. If he doesn't respect you on the ground, he won't respect you on his back. He has to follow you, but never out of fear. He has to follow you willingly. You have to synchronize your movements. Horses communicate through body language and energy. You have to feel your horse, in order to understand it. Horses understand images. Send him an image of what you want him to do. If he really trusts you, he will follow your thoughts. If not, it's not his mistake but yours. Legend has it that horse and sleeper are destined for each other. Even so, you must learn to be a good leader. You are a herd. A herd? The two of us? A herd of two. And you're its leader. Now we'll see, if he accepts you. Go on. Remember, your fear is his fear. Yes. Now we can begin. It's not for him to decide, Michelle! Show him who's on top! Come here. Michelle, the state coach will be attending our tournament in a few days. You do know what that means? He just won't lift his legs. I don't know what more I can do. - There's a lot of me in you. So get your butt in gear and get him to lift his legs. Go on. - Yes, Mrs. Kaltenbach. Good morning, Master. What have you got planned for us today? Nothing. Today's my day off. So what do we do'? Do what you do best. Which is? Fly! That was amazing! It was just incredible. It was at least 1.6 meters! It was world-class. Not even Paul Schockemцhle would've jumped that! - Who's Paul Schockemцhle? Hello, Windstorm. He hasn't learned to speak yet. - I'd never have believed it. Wait 'til Mrs. Kaltenbach sees this, she'll eat her cap. You'll show everyone! It'll be the highlight of the tournament! I don't know. Maybe the tournament is too much. I mean, all those people! What if we - But wait a minute, that's what it was all for, right? That's why I've been lying to Mrs. Kaltenbach all this time. To save him. We're not ready yet. We need more time. Yes, maybe you do. But he has none left. Mum? Hello, darling. How are the studies coming along? I wanted to ask you something. If you've just learned something but you're not sure if you can do it Listen, I have to get back to my particle zoo. Of course you can do it. You can do anything you set your mind to. Sorry, I don't have time now. Talk to you later. Bye. Tomorrow we'll be represented by Michelle, but today you will all get a chance to try out the official course. Who wants to start? - Me! Oh man, Archibald fell in love with a cow. I couldn't get him off the meadow. No worries, they haven't started yet. Gate! Very well, but now Michelle will show you how it's done properly Who else is coming'? What's this'? Please, Mrs. Kaltenbach, I can't explain. You'll just have to see for yourself. Please. Go on then. Go on, show them. I'll lead the way. You did good for a start. Not I, he. Did you see, Michelle? That's what I mean. You should ride Weingraf like that tomorrow. It'll be a walk in the park tomorrow. First you'll have some explaining to do. Although I do believe our chances for tomorrow have more than doubled. Gate, please. You really surprised me today. Obviously you are a true Kaltenbach. These were supposed to go to your mother, bu Well. Thanks! I wow! An impeccable dress code is part of a rider's virtues, as you will learn. It's all going a little fast, right'? You have an extraordinary talent. It was all Windstorm I didn't do anything. Tomorrow is an important day. Get some sleep. Grandma? - Yes? About your leg, he never meant to hurt you. We hope you've all had a good journey here, and we'd like to welcome all our visitors from near and far to the Kaltenbach stud farm. We begin with the qualification jumping at eight o'clock. The jumping-squad inspection will take place in the riding hall, as the highlight of the day. We're glad that many sponsors made this event possible. WOW! I don't believe it! - I'd prefer my sneakers. You think he'll come? My grandfather hasn't set foot on the ranch in ten years, so don't be disappointed, okay? You two will manage on your own. STATE SHOWJUMPING COACH Tinka? - Yes? Want to walk the course with me? - Me? Really? Sure, I need some pointers. By the way, I think you were right. Do you have some of this lotion left? - Sure, I'll give it to you. But don't use too much or I know. Now come on. You can help me put on the saddle. I fear the Hungarian came for nothing. I know I look weird. But so do you. What are we doing here? I don't want to bother you, but he'll need these. So he won't hurt himself. - I didn't know that. No problem. My pleasure. In the end we both want what's best for Kaltenbach. I'm glad you think so. Well then, break a leg! And don't forget the boots. Well then, let's get to it. And now, from Kaltenbach, number 23, Michelle von Ritter on Weingraf. Steady keep calm. That was Michelle von Ritter. Her time: 94.3 seconds for a clear round. That puts her in first place. Everything okay? No. Something's bothering him. And now the final contestant. Number 24, also from Kaltenbach, Windstorm, presented by Mika Schwarz. Windstorm? And my granddaughter. What's wrong? What is it? Sam, don't! How is she'? She had more luck than the boy. It's only a scratch. - What about Sam? We'll look after him. I should have never allowed it. That horse will always be dangerous. - Something was bothering him. I can't explain First he made me a cripple and now this. The Hungarian will take him today. - What? No, no! Sam's on the way to hospital. She wants to give Windstorm to the Hungarian. He's here already. Can't you help me? I'm so sorry about Sam. It wasn't Windstorm's fault. - If Sam dies, it's my fault. I told her Windstorm is a diff cult horse. I should have never sold him. Mrs. Kaltenbach's judgment isn't what it used to be. After all, she's well past 60. - I'm 67. Fanny, can you hear me? - Yes. For the first time in three weeks! Tell me where you are. I'll explain later. Really? You're coming? Did you convince your mum? Cool! - Fanny Where are you now? On the highway near Bremen. - Then head for Wilhelmshaven and Schillig by the sea. I'll send you a link. - Thanks. Elisabeth! - Where's my daughter? We're looking for her. But she can't have gone far, after all, she has a horse with her. - A horse? Of course. What was I thinking, sending her here? - Yes, do come in. Hasn't changed much. Mika liked it here. Sure. That's why she ran away. She could become an exceptional horsewoman. - Unbelievable. To you there are only two kinds of people: those who ride horses and those who don't. I won't let you bend her over, too! - What do you mean "bend her over"? Your daughter would love to trade in all those tomes on quantum physics for a pair of riding boots. Prefers to sleep in the stable than in her bed. Yes. But only because she wants you to see her. Oh, Elli. I'm sure I made many mistakes. Come on, let's have something to eat. I think we're here. I still can't see you. Only a chick on a horse. A chick? Mika? Horse? Mika! I've been wondering what took you so long. Did you ride the whole way? What horse is that? And anyway, a horse? And then I split. - They wanted to turn him into salami? Hungarian salami! That's horrible! So now what? That we'll decide tomorrow. We have to feed Windstorm first. We'll see to that. Right, you heard, the horse is hungry. All supplies on deck! Next. Next! Morning. Where's Windstorm? - We had to hide him. The supervisors were getting suspicious. - I dreamed something was wrong with him. Now that you mention it I don't know much about horses, but is it normal when they swell up and spit foam? What'? What's wrong? Oh God! I'll help you. What is it? Hey, this is Sam. I'm probably at the stables. Leave a message. Windstorm. Don't give up. No, she hasn't shown up yet. Hello? What? - What? - Where? She's not at all well. I don't know what to do. My Darling. He doesn't want to get up. Help him. Yes. Let's have a look. - We'll take care of him, okay? You're burning up. No! - It's colic. I have to stay with him. Windstorm - No reason to be afraid There's nothing physically wrong with her. Looks like she's in shock. We gave her a mild sedative. Thank you. Uncle Kaan? - Hello, Elli. It's just crazy. Mika's never been interested in horses. Maria didn't notice her daughter's gift just as you haven't. Two smart women who see so little. What gift? Mika feels the horse. She can sense him. Only very few people have this ability. Remember how you came to me? - I wanted to run away. Away from all these reins and bits And you succeeded. I have to get back to my grandson. He woke up. Thank god. Thick skull. Takes after me. Hello, Sweetpea. Good morning, honey. What's with Windstorm? It's alright. Everything's alright. Here's someone else who wants to say hello. Sam! I hear you've been stealing horses. Mrs. Kaltenbach'? Yes? - I just wanted to say how sorry I am about your granddaughter. - Yes, alright, Michelle. Here, they're yours. - Really? Thank you. By the way, Mrs. Kaltenbach, the state coach called. I've made the team! How nice. It's all my fault. - Nonsense. It's hardly surprising. That much Pepagon on a sensitive horse like Windstorm How were you to know? - Pepa-what? The deep heat you put on his fetlocks. You probably meant well, but it burns like hell. You can't put on too much. You didn't put it on? - No. His boots were soaking in the stuff! I'd recognize that smell anywhere. Who else would do it? - Michelle gave me those things. We have to get to Kaltenbach! Wait right there, where are you going? They'll kill him, if we don't do anything. - We're going home and forget this sad affair. - Mum, Dad, I may be the disappointment of your lives because I have no clue about quantum stuff but I finally know what I'm good at. What? - Flying! On a horse! I've never met anyone with such a strong bond to horses. It is your great performance that enables me to appoint you to the junior team of the state of Hessen. Congratulations. - Thank you. I will do my best. Windstorm wasn't to blame. Michelle soaked his boots with Pepagon. That's why he bolted. - Are you crazy? I know you'd like an explanation for what happened, but Windstorm is a difficult horse. - He isn't! And Sam could've died! Do you have any kind of proof for this accusation? Sam smelled it. Are you still drugged? - Can we carry on now, unless anyone has anything to add to resolve this matter? - Yes. I have! If I'd known, I'd never have given you the ointment! You little rat, give them to me! - No way! - Stop it! It was her idea. - No, it wasn't! - You will leave my farm right now! See if I care! I never liked it here, on this second rate pony farm. - Wait! Not so fast. The jacket This will have consequences! - Go ahead, Grandpa! Mika! Wait! Mika should come back soon, she really is talented. She'll make the team straight away. - Mum. - Sorry, sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't blame yourself. I'm sure he wasn't the last pigheaded guy in her life. I didn’t just mean Mika. I know. Next time the literature stays home. Yes, and thanks, uhm... - Philipp. What for'? Well, I take it, it was your idea to call me? See you next time. Won't you say goodbye to the stable boy? Thanks for everything. Come back. Probably another tractor that fell over. That's all we need. Sweetpea! Don't be sad. As you know, nothing gets lost in space. It's only the form that changes. Maybe he's up there somewhere, watching over you. Stop the car! - Mika, we're standing still. What's going on'? - Maybe she's got to pee. Windstorm. How did you do it? Overactive bladders run in your family What's the matter'? That runs in my family! There she is! Starting number 88 on a wildcard She'll be disqualified like that. - Mike Schwarz on Windstorm. - Oh, no! Did you really think she'd play along with this circus? - At least a reason to argue. It's great without a saddle. Very brave! - Physically speaking a real challenge, because of the aerodynamics alone.
