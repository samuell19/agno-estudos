Are you sure about this guy? Don't worry. This isn't a big deal. Just think of it as a scene from a cartoon. Better yet, a movie. You and I are the lead. How's that? A killer, eh? The guy's name is Sen. The toughest. Number one in this area. He's experienced. He can't turn me down. It's like that with us. Shit like this requires a professional touch. That's the way it's got to be. I'm not sending my baby brother to jail. Fuck, what about that bitch? Hey. Are you here? Parking slip? Hey, bro. Say hello. - Hello. - My lil' brother. So who died?

Am I being too nosy? I'm sorry. No Caller ID Who's this? Don't know. Don't know? Sure, you must get busy on nights like this. Hey. My brother. He's nothing like us. He went to college and he's gonna be something. Mama's boy, that one. If anything goes wrong I take full responsibility. Just help us with the body, please. Fuck you. I got a mama and a brother too. Once we are done you can take all my stash. Fuck you! - Trust a fuckhead like you? - Why the hell would I lie about this, huh? - How much? - I'm disappointed. You know you can trust me. Bullshit. You're just an errand boy. With what those Kosians promised me it's almost 1kg. You can guess how much in cash. 1kg? - 1kg?! - Yep. - Don't fuck with me at a time like this. - I'm not! You think I wouldn't stash any while handling the goods? You know the stuff's as good as anyone's on the market. And quite frankly I've been dealing with your shit for almost free. That's not the way to do business. You should know fuckups like us better watch our back. Fucking threatening me? Asking a favor. And I should trust you, motherfucker? First thing as soon as we're out. How's that? Fine. Also, I was never here. Obviously. And if you're shitting me now I'll scrape your eyeballs out. Gruesome. No joke. Fine. Go ahead. Just get rid of the body. Then it's all yours. Heetae. Come with me. Mr. Baek! So hard to get a hold of you. Where you at? Are you out? Fucking reception. We can't have more people involved. I'll take care of it. You just sit tight. What's on your mind? Just chill. - Nothing we can do now. - You should've fucking said so. You wanna fucking bury the body yourself? - Stop bitching and just chill out. - I fucking killed a man. So you know. Are you fucking high? I told you to chill the fuck out. - I asked if you're fucking stoned. - Sit down, motherfucker! You killed a man. This is your mess. We pay them. They take care of the shit. That's the deal. Got it? If anything goes wrong he's going down with us. I've got plans so just trust me. Understood? I'll turn myself in. So you'll go to jail too? That'll kill mom. Then you'll see what you've done. I'm warning you. Just do as I say. Hey. Wake up. Kangtae. What? Why didn't you tell me about your stash. You hate seeing me stoned. No, not that. You got money so why are we doing this shit. I'm fucking struggling to pay back my student loan. If you got dough, then why? That shit isn't yours. I ain't got nothing stashed. What if he finds out? Why worry about that now? You worry too much. For all I know, we're all fucked. My life is just fucked up. You've always been a little fuckhead. What's your name? J. Is that your nickname? Not bad, J. What's your going price? I can offer you a job. Like what? I can get you twice of what you make. You know. I own a few bars down in Gangnam. Oh, I see. A rich man. Weird Why aren't you scared? You got any debt? You have no clue who I called. Ever seen a hitman? Wanna see them fucking limbs cut off before your eyes? A live show. You're messed up. Just admit that you're terrified. Fucking whore. Don't touch it. I'll get the door now. You boys stay upstairs. Take your stink eyes back up, motherfuckers. Got yourself a new jacket? Made in USA, eh? I appreciate your business, once again. No need for that. We're like, you know, crocodile and plover bird. Is there a crocodile? Not here. You look good, by the way. Heard you were in China. Work is scarce in Korea these days. Anyway, is this your work? Not my work. It's a guy I know. A dealer. We're tight. I'm doing him a favor. Got it? Were you paid? Paid what? I told you, we're tight. I'll introduce you guys. Wait, you don't do drugs. What's the matter? You fucking idiot. Why didn't you mention your company? You want us all dead? Fuck. Alright. Hold on. Fuck, is this for real? You definitely got paid. What is it? Tell me before I cut your throat. Fuck you! I told you. He's a buddy of mine. Fuck. This isn't right. I got your family that fine house in the city. A fucking mansion. Fuck. You gotta watch your manners especially with your customers. Crazy fuck. I'm sorry. Alright, get off. - Just do your job. - Yes. - And watch yourself. - Yes. Have a seat. Look up. Ready? 1, 2, 3! Y'all should stay low. 81.5 million per head so 163 million for two. Special discount of 300 for my loyal patron. Sure, no worries. Wait. Do we pay for her as well? What the fuck are you saying? She should pay for herself. Pay for getting killed? That's immoral. How can you ask your victim for payment. - That's inhumane, I tell you. - He's just kidding. Just take care of the body. I can't really work here. I'll need to find a work space. Why did it get so expensive? Every part needs to be manually disassembled. You can't bury them in the mountains. The animals dig up the skulls and prance around. It's best to grind them up and feed them to pigs. The clothes can go into used clothing bin. The ones on the streets? Yes, they're filled with dirty clothes. They take them all and wash them in batch. Right under their nose, that's the safest. You still have doubts? - Call it off, then. - No, I have no doubt. Got it. His ID. He owns this place. That's about it. He isn't the owner here.. What? I'm the owner. He's my stalker. What's going on? Fuck, Kangtae. You fucking bitch. Do I look like an idiot? You don't think we've been here before? Then why don't you know? He came to help out tonight. It's Halloween. You fuckers. - No, that's not true. - Shut the fuck up. And the dead guy And he's a prosecutor. She's lying. Cut the bullshit, you bitch! I'm telling the truth. It's up to you whether you believe it or not. You really fucked up tonight. You want to fucking die, Mr. VIP? I didn't know about this, either. Let go. Now. Mr. Baek? Don't move, motherfucker. Fucking assholes. Hey, Heetae! Get up, you idiots! Hey, the gun! Don't move, motherfuckers! - Stay back. - Alright. - Fucking over there. - Yes, sir. - Hey, little bro. - Shut you fat fuck! Kangtae, let's go. Let's kill these fuckers and take off. Kangtae! - What the fuck is that? - Don't come any closer! Stay back. Alright. He's bleeding badly. Turn around, face the wall. - Turn around. - Okay, okay. Lose the pants. Take 'em off! - Why the pants? - Shut up! I'll blow off your head. Listen up. I got nothing to lose. One move and everyone dies. Don't do anything stupid. Kangtae, you alright? Can you hold on? Just a little longer. - You, turn around. - Me? Do your thing. Right here? Clean up nicely or we all die. - Do it. - Okay. Just do it! If he dies you all die. You, get up! Come with me. Hurry up. Come on. - Are you going to watch? - Shut up and hurry. Wait. Is that right? What if blood splatters all over. What do you know. You said there's no time. The axe will just make a mess. It's my first time using this but I know this works. Just wait outside. Fuck... I'm sorry. May I wash my face? Fucking creep... do it quick. - The blood won't come off. - Hurry up! Move it, bitch. Hey. You alright? Where's the package? With your client? Where the fuck is it? What's the passcode? Tell me the fucking passcode. Fucking do it. Keep your word. - Stay down. - Alright. - Keep your head down, fucker. - Alright. If he dies you die, got that? Kangtae. Hold on, you can make it. Let's get this done and go see mom. Okay? Heetae... What? Say it. Son of a bitch. Die. Keep checking. Fuck me. All the blood. Wrap it up. What about your brother? We're going to the hospital. Wait. You sure? They'll be suspicious. Then what, fucking leave him to die? How about we treat him in my work space? I've got all the tools. - Don't fuck with me. - Yes, sir. He's right. We've got everything we need. - You can save him, right? - Sure. I said, we're going to the hospital. Do what you want with the body. We're all accomplices. Hey, is he really a prosecutor? What? Tell me the truth. Oh, you actually believed that? Sorry. You fucking bitch! Hurry up! Wait. Get upstairs. Get inside the storage, go! The storage, go now! Fuck. Hello. Open up. It's the police. I know you're in there. We got a call. Hi. I remember the owner, it's not you. It's my brother's place. I came out to give a hand. What were you doing in there? Sleeping. It's three in the morning. I heard screaming. Screaming? I don't know about that. Anyway, someone reported a gunshot in the area. It's happened before. It's not us. Must be somewhere else. I see. Can we have a look inside? What for? I was just trying to sleep. I understand, but there was a report. You can't barge in like this. We've received a report. I heard you, but this is unacceptable. Okay, we understand. Then mind if I use your toilet? - Now? - There's no public restroom nearby. - But our bathroom.. - Please, I really must go now. Thank you. Excuse me. Yes? Is your hand okay? Oh, this. It's nothing. I was painting the walls earlier. Can I see you ID? My ID? I don't have it with me now. You were not alone. No. How do you know each other? She's my girlfriend. Is that correct? Sure, why not. You didn't hear a gunshot, either? No gunshot but I heard an argument. It was him. Lies. Stop saying bullshit in public. Hey! Hand over my phone, you fucker. Did something happen here? Fine! Fuck it. This bitch keeps cheating on me. Why do I need to explain this shit.. So I took her phone away. Here! Is that correct? Sure, why not. There you go again. Would you like a drink? Or, are you on duty? Cops. You're so full of doubts. Thanks for your cooperation. Give us a call if you need help. Okay. I'm sure you two can work things out. We'll make up again. Hey. Thank you. You think I'm an idiot? Is this funny to you? Go check on your brother. Lead the way. It's not funny anymore. Give me the gun. Don't move. - Your shoe's untied. - Stay still. I'll shoot you. Okay. Just shoot me. Do it. Shoot! Don't move, motherfucker. - Scared? - Stay back. It's my gun! Don't - Give my gun back. - Stay away. My gun, motherfucker! You piece of shit. You little fuckhead! You think I'm your bitch, huh? What you looking at, fucker? Fucking make me sweat. Don't mind this crazy fuck. Let's quit fooling around. And just get the hell out of here. You going to stay? Your brother's dead. I'll look after you from now on. Let's clean up and leave. Just the two of us. I can't fucking do it myself. We got to clean up this mess. You little fuck. Wait. Just wait. It's weird seeing you so still. I'm sorry. But now you're finally clean. Congratulations. Mom really suffered because of you. Remember? And dad died worrying about you. You can't deny that. So don't feel too bad for yourself. Mom will get through this. She'll be devastated. Maybe she'll think it's all for the best. I don't know. I'm really fucking sorry, bro. I hope you don't think I got you killed. We're step brothers, anyway So don't fucking feel too sorry for yourself. You fucking ruined our family and you aren't even sorry. Isn't that right? You be good. No more trouble now. Don't you start smoking shit again. You'll end up in hell anyway. I'll bury you in mom's backyard. Anything else? I'll take the blame. I'll tell them that I did it. Too late. Think about it. Those jerks outside. They're the worst. Not me. Shut up. You think it'll make a difference having me killed? It won't I'm telling you. They will kill you. You think about it. You're wrong. I'm the only one who gets out alive. Look down. Do it. Please. Don't kill me. Let me live. Spare my life. Got a plan? I trust you. Let me handle this. Trust me. I do. So shut up. Fuck me. - Bag them. - What? Put 'em in the bags. Son of a bitch. Hey, come on. Think of it as pork. That fucker's gonna get himself killed. Mr.Baek is mocking us with his hands tied. I'll let you live if you give it to me now. Have you ever done it with body parts lying around? So fucking hot. I can feel my fucking blood boil. Just this one time. Five minutes, eh? No, three minutes. I'll cum quick. C'mon, let's do it. Just do it, bitch! I'll save your life. Fucking whore.
