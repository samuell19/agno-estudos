TWO SHOTS FIRED In early December, just before holidays... ...I went to dance at a club in the western suburbs. I came back home at dawn. It was the hottest day of the year. It was already 33 degrees before the sun had gone up. In the toolshed I found a gun. No one knew it was there. I fired twice. One bullet pierced my stomach, the other grazed my head. But I survived. A week later, I was back home. Aren't you gonna get that? - No. I bet it's for your brother, or somebody who found the dog. They can leave a message. Pick up, if you want to. Hello. Yes. No, we've just got in. No, not now. I'll let you know. Bye. I'm going to buy lunch. You can order some. There are takeout menus on the fridge. Chinese? Pizza? Empanadas? I'm calling Pizza Piú. Get me a vegetable chop suey. You were advised to avoid physical effort. This is not physical effort. Can you get that, Ezequiel? - I can't, I'm getting the door. I'll let the machine get in, then. Who is it? - Chinese food. Hi. This is yours. Is it you or is it me? It's me. At the end of the day we swept the area trying to find Yago. We decided to cover a four-block radius starting from the house. We should widen the radius. - How far shall we go? I've heard that some dogs can get very far. They walk, walk and walk... That night Ezequiel made some flyers and posted Yago's photo on missing pet sites. It was an impulse, it was very hot. Let's try a test. Tell me what you see on each drawing. A month ago, I did this in Career Counseling. I think I know how I'm supposed to answer. There's nothing here. Inhale through your mouth. Exhale. Breathe in again. Let it out. Does it hurt when you breathe? - No. Only one bullet was found in my room. They believed that I still had the other one inside. Where you able to practice? - Yes. Let's start with The Nightingale. You have to clean that flute, Mariano. It sounds awful. Mom gave me this clock to remind you when to take your medicine. It's set to ring every six hours. I'm not taking them. - What should I tell mom? What are they? I'm not anxious or depressed. What should I do with the pills? Don't know. Give them back to her. Tell her it's not necessary to hide the knives and stuff. I'll be right back. What can I get you? - Ketchup and mayo. Is this enough? Yes, thanks. Stop. Is your flute making that harmonic, Mariano? It's not the flute, it's me. It could be that there's still a bullet inside me. We're gonna have to live with that doubled sound until it gets better. Sorry. I apologize. - What for? You don't have to. - I insist. I apologize. Let's get back to Palestrina. I can't stay today. I have to go. - OK. Are you OK? Yes, go back to sleep. I keep the kitchen door locked. Mariano has to jump out the window. The sedative we used to give Yago for the fireworks was in the broom closet. I dug a hole and buried it with the rest. Today I took everything out for you to take it away. But it's best if I bury it again and have Mariano moved in with you. Give Mariano my cell phone. I've just bought a new one. Here. She asked me to give it to you. So you can always be reached. Hello? A message says I've got voice-mail. How do you turn off the sound? We have to empty and clean up that room. Hi, Susana. Mariano is not here. He didn't warn you? - No. You found me here by luck. Mariano is staying at his brother's. He should've told you. No one did, and I'll have to charge for the class anyways. It's all right. Can I offer you coffee or tea since you are here? Sure, thanks. My time's already paid for. It's beaten. Sugar or sweetener? It's instant coffee? - Yes. Whatever. Sweetener is fine. Excuse me. Hello. Yes. Mariano remembered about the class. Margarita is here. Why calling the cell? It's expensive. I'll get the cordless so you two can work it out. For next time. I can't find it. Do you have my new number? I gave Mariano the old one. There it is. Some people still call me on the old number. Hello? Tele-marketer. They waste your time. Voicemail. It must be Mariano. Let's call him. Hello. What happened? No, nobody told me. Susana thought you'd tell me and you thought Susana would. Tuesday, then. I'll ask your mother. Work on Händel's sonata, OK? I think it's out of battery. That night, Ezequiel had to work on some company's computers. Remove belt, keys and coins. It's not that, he has a bullet inside. Inside his body? - Yes. If the detector beeps... - I'll wait here. How long will it take? - About an hour. Take a seat. Who was it? - Nobody. It's the voice-mail again. Silence it, set it to vibrate. I can't, it's an old phone. I only managed to change the ringtone. Where is it? Excuse me, I can't silence it. Let me see. This is prehistoric. You can't turn it down. You better shut it off. - I can't. I must stay reachable. Da capo. Thank you. Hi. A burger, a chicken burger and a large Coke. You don't know who I am, do you? - Yes. I saw you at the record store, a week ago. I've seen you around here too. Besides that, I mean. I'm Ana. Laura's cousin. Hi. - Hi. Have we met? - I don't think so. No? - Maybe I came to a party once. Could be. - The house looks familiar. Come in. It's a compilation of Independiente's goals. I have a selection of River's. My brother roots for Independiente. Last year I've thrown three parties: My birthday, Halloween... ...and one for New Year's. Must be Halloween. I took some acid that night and went to four or five places. My brother doesn't smoke either. He plays the flute in a quartet. Woodwind musicians can't smoke, they'd go breathless. Two weeks ago he found a gun and shot himself twice. One In the stomach and one In the forehead. Nobody knows how, but he survived. The doctors think he still has a bullet inside. How is he coping? - We don't want to leave him alone. My dad was at the doctor's waiting room once... ...and a woman jumped out of the window. Did something happen? - What? Did something happen between us at that party? I'm sorry I don't remember. I was on acid and was dressed up as well. Do you have a phone number? - I'm never home. You'll get my dad. A mobile? I'll give you mine. Next Saturday it's my brother's birthday, we'll throw a party. Dial your number. I'll ask my boyfriend if he wants to go. We're breaking up. I brought the tunics. One blue and one orange for each. I talked to Silvina. She is leaving the group. What are we going to do? - We could become a trio. But trio repertoires are limited and less interesting. The other option is getting a new member. What're we going to do? Let's ask private teachers, music schools, and so on. Is it worth the effort? Mariano's sound should go back to normal. - How do you know? Must be something that needs to resettle in his body. It's the bullet inside me. I'm doing breathing exercises Margarita taught me. Let's give it some time. For my birthday we painted the apartment black. Hi. - Hi. Come in. Javier, my boyfriend... Ezequiel. It's his brother's birthday. Hi. - Hello. We brought some beverages. - I'll take them to the kitchen. It smells like paint. Mariano wanted to paint the apartment for the party. Mariano is the one who shot himself twice. He's over there. Ana and I met a few years ago at a quit-smoking program. We smoked our last cigarette together. What did you get your brother? I don't know what to get him. Last year my mom asked him what he wanted. He asked for a metronome, but she bought a chronometer. What would you like? Beer, wine, soda. What should I bring you? - Beer. I'll go with you. I thought you'd wear your uniform. Barely recognized you. The other day, Javier smelled my cigarette breath... ...and asked me if I was smoking again. He even guessed the brand. The following weekend we went to the beach for a few days. Ezequiel invited Ana to come with us. I brought chicken and beef. Javier likes chicken. You? Beef. - Both. I'll put them in the fridge. There's no microwave. There used to be an electric oven somewhere. Where? I don't know. The doctor has told me I couldn't get in the water until the wound was healed. Ana said she was going to the beach with you. Ana is his girlfriend. - We're breaking up. A whiskey. - An espresso. Nothing. - Get a whiskey. It'll lose your inhibitions. Why should I? - You'll relax. I want coffee. - One espresso, two whiskies. One espresso, two whiskies. - Right. I'll have to spend the night. I live in Lanús. It would take me three hours to get there. No problem. Laura... - Yes? It's kind of embarrassing... Can you lend me some money for transportation? Yes, OK. It's $3.25 for the bus, $2 for the train... ...and $18 for the taxi from the station. Around $25. Here. - I'll give it back next time. Don't worry. - Bye. Have you known him for long? - Last night. From the web. Will you see him again? My brother has a bullet inside. - He must remove belt, keys and coins. - He can't get through then. I'll wait here, you go. Are you sure? - Yes. But I have to meet a girl. - Where? Inside. I don't know her. I made the date from Buenos Aires. I have a picture. Let me have it. I'll look for her. Does she have yours? - Yes. I'll tell her you're outside. I'll leave the car open, at least you'll have music. I waited in the car listening to some music. Lucia? Yes. You must be Mariano. Yes. You don't look like the picture. - You neither, you look younger. You never asked my age. Are you leaving tomorrow morning like you said? Yes. - Great. Lucía came back with us. She had never been to Buenos Aires. Don't be nervous. - I'm not. Which piece did you choose? - You didn't bring anything? You didn't mention that I had to audition when I replied the ad. I don't understand why you sent me a nude photo. It was the only one I had. - No one asked for one. Händel's Sonata in A minor? We'll vote. Please, wait outside, Lucia. I vote yes. - I vote yes. I vote no. Lucia. Come in. Sit down, please. It was two against one. We'll give you a second chance. You could work on the score and come back next week. You can photocopy the original two blocks from here. OK. We'll wait here. Go out, turn left and walk two hundred meters. It's on this side, you'll find it. That was very good. Now we all agree, you're in. Some useful information: our repertoire is obviously ancient music, Renaissance and Baroque. Practice is on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays... Tuesdays at 10:30 am, Thursdays at 6:00 pm and Saturdays at 3:00 pm. You're expected to attend them all. Each member is expected to study and perform flawlessly his or her part. This is a quartet. No one can fail or we all pay for it. Are you OK with this? Practice starts next week. You didn't tell me how much you pay. For what? - For working in the group. Nobody gets paid, this is pro bono. This is a vocational group, nobody plays ancient music for money. Then I'll have to find a job, because I run out of money. Yes. I'll be out in two minutes. My boyfriend. He's picking me up and he's going your way, he could give you a lift. The three of us on the bike? - I'm not going. Please tell him I have to work double shift. We are breaking up. This is me. I'm renting a room from Ezequiel's mother. How long have you been breaking up? - Two years, at least. It's Friday night. You have plans? - No. You want to go out? Maybe some other day. I want to get up early to study. OK. - Bye, thanks. I thought the bike was the delivery guy. Have you eaten? Not much. - You like Chinese food? It was pizza or Chinese, but picked Chinese. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. I ate something at work. There he is. I almost forgot. I brought the tunics. Two for each, one blue, one orange. If it doesn't fit you, we'll have it tailored. Let's start and talk wardrobe later. It's late. Yes, you're right. I apologize again. Let's do Gibbons. This sounds like more of a quintet than a quartet. Is it Mariano's flute? - It's not his flute, it's him. He started that double sound like a month ago. It's supposed to go away. Da capo. Stupid... I brought some food from work if you prefer. I'll fix something fast. Faster than this, impossible. It's fast food and it's already cooked. I'll heat it up in the microwave. - OK. Later I need you to help me move the dog food into the tool shed. Between the two of us will be easier. It's more than 20 kilos. Let's do it now while the food is heating up. I feel so stupid. I saw "3-kilo bonus" and I bought it. And the dog ran away over a month ago. - Why don't you return it then? Yes, I could. There's still a chance he shows up, though. Maybe it's an omen. A sign. The grass is getting pretty high in the yard. Mariano used to mow it. It's hard to find a gardener. In the summer, even if you mow, it grows fast. Gardeners don't come, neither pool guys. I barely use the pool. It's always their schedule. They don't show up, you call them, it's off. It's not easy. I prefer to just leave things like this. Lucía could not sleep. Neither could my mother. It's nothing. She took the pills Tuesday morning and woke up Thursday. I got distracted. It was raining. Besides, it's judicial recess. I feel better now, more relaxed. How many pills did you take? - Three. She slept 72 hours straight. Wait outside, please. We'll try couch therapy. Lie down. Alright. Let's go back to the desk. Haven't you thought about taking a vacation, now that is judicial recess? How long has it been since you took a few days off? We have an apartment at the beach. But I don't like the beaches in Argentina that much. Let's try a test. The towel I had put on my head was still wet when I woke up. It hasn't dried in three days. Unbelievable. It's this city's climate. I feel like I'm still wearing it. I even feel like my hair's still wet. I can't keep this at home. Find a way to get rid of it. I meant to throw it out, but I felt I'd be destroying evidence. Put it in your purse. I'm not carrying that around. Lucía decided to leave the group and move out of my mother's. She was going to look for another room, didn't want to leave Buenos Aires. As a temporary solution, we think the best would be... ...Eleonora and I becoming a duo for a while. The repertoire for trios is very limited... ...and we don't think finding someone else is worth the effort. Auditions and tests can be taxing. Especially, if we are not ready. I agree. Again, it's temporary, until you're back to normal. In the meantime I can take you to the Conservatory... ...check other options, percussion or strings. Maybe you could try the choir, to save you from buying a new instrument. It's only temporary, just until your sound is back and you can play again. New subject: Lucía didn't return the tunics. Please check if she left them at your mother's. The next day, my mother told me she was going to the beach with my music teacher. That night, Ezequiel got an email with the travel information... ...offering to share the car expenses and the drive. He forwarded it to all his contacts. Susana? - No, I'm Margarita. I'm Susana. - Nice to meet you. Liliana. Let's put these in the trunk. Margarita and I made a plan: I drive to Chascomús, we grab a bite, then you take the wheel... ...and Margarita covers the last 100 since she drove up to here. Yesterday I cut my foot on a broken bottle. My kids threw a party and the idiots broke some bottles. I walked out barefoot, cut myself and lost blood. To live with these monsters I should wear an armor suit. But you have to live too. My right foot is completely numb, I can't hit the gas pedal. Come say hello! My sons: Andrés, Marcos and Santiago. Marcos and Santiago are twins. Hi. Andrés told me about your trip. - I just got an email and forwarded it. It's been eight years since I've gone on a vacation. I can't even remember my last. I'm a sunbathing nut. I use my yard, even if there's no pool. The kids use the hose. I prefer to take a shower every now and then. Andrés is very different from his brothers. Do they have the same father? - They all do. It doesn't show. He's the most sensitive. The other two are beasts. They never clean up, they are a mess. They're like animals, they don't work, don't study, just watch TV and do drugs. I don't know where they get the money from. Must be their father. Are you divorced? - Yes. Yes. But we still hook up sometimes. We live three blocks away. I have some pastries my sons brought from the beach. What kind? Dulce de leche, chocolate, fruit... Why don't you take off your shoes to drive? It's the countryside, you're on holidays. Men are more sensual when driving barefoot. Why would you say "men"? We're all women here. OK, it was a general concept. "Men" as in people". Sure. They must be at the beach. Can I use your phone? Mine's out of credit. How silly! I brought the cordless handset. I used to have a maid twice a week that stole my cordless phone... ...but only took the handset. I went nuts looking for it. I pushed the base button but nothing happened. I never understood what she'd do with a handset. Voicemail. Let's go and look for them. Maybe she thought it was a mobile. The maid. - Right, that's possible. They're not here. Must have gone back to the house. Let's go downtown, maybe we find them around. It seems there are people at the house, a light is on. You guys go ahead. I'll wait here for them. - It's dark, don't stay here by yourself. Leave them a note, ask them to call you and come with us. It's less than ten kilometers. They can pick you up or we'll bring you back. The humidity of the seaside. It's like there was salt in the air. When you open a window, you get more humidity. Must be your friends from La Lucila del Mar. Yes. Where? OK. It was Arturo, my ex-husband. He's near Chascomús. Headed to Sergio and Fede's in La Lucila del Mar. We are going to the beach. I'll refill the ice trays and go with you. Can you get it, please? I'm soaked. It's in my purse. Yes, just a second. It's your ex-husband. Ask him if he found Sergio and Fede. Liliana asked me to take the message. She asks if you saw... yes. OK, I'll tell her. He's in La Lucilia and it's raining there. He can't find Sergio and Fede. He'll wait for them and call you later. They're here. Arturo, Adriana, Susana, Margarita. We'll leave our things here and look for a hotel. Lilt's coming with us. How about going to the harbour and buy some mussels, first? What time did you leave Buenos Aires? - Made it in less than three hours. A car tried to overtake us but we left it behind. He always needs a pretext to go faster. I always come to the beach. He loves the ocean, even in the winter. He says it's warmer in the water than outside. I can't drive faster here than across the city there. Tap water is safe here. Even food tastes different. Let's go get the mussels. - Let's go. When I'm back, I'll ask Mariano and Ezequiel to swap houses. I'd like to live in an apartment. Also, the house is too big for me. Good idea. If you'll excuse me, I'll lock myself in with my music. No problem. They only had frozen mussels at the harbour. No shell, much better. No sand grinding in your teeth. Arturo prepares them with garlic, parsley and white wine. Got a cheap wine for cooking, and other beverages. There's a Chinese supermarket, much cheaper than Buenos Aires. Polish vodka, Mexican Tequila, Iranian pistachios, Dutch herring... Do you have an apron? - I'll fix some drinks. A cigarette, please. You want one? Do you mind if we smoke here? I don't smoke, but it's fine. Well, you're on vacation... - No, thank you. And you? What was your name again? - Margarita. No, thanks. Margarita is a flute professor. Woodwind musicians can't smoke. Right, they'd go breathless. - Yes. In the 70s I had a Lancia, an Italian car. They make them so fast nowadays. Manufacturers and governments agreed not to pass certain limits. There was more freedom back then. - Sexual, political and emotional freedom. Bullshit. - For you. Bullshit. Hi. No, I'm at the beach. Everybody's sleeping. The clippers arrived, not the little purses. On the photo the purse looks big, but it's small. Purple and red, both with a white trim. I need mild and extra mild soap... ...and medium whiteners, numbers two and four... ...large Grammatically, Total, two creamy lotions... ...foundation 05, SPF30 sun-block... Quick corrector. This is the most urgent restocking. We'll see which sells faster. I'm telling you by heart, I'm not home. I'm making some coffee. - Great. I need one badly. Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. I'm going to try and find Sergio and Fede. Come with me? I'm sunbathing. Ask your wife. - Adriana never wakes up before noon. Susana? Want to go for an early ride? - Why not? I've got a sunstroke so I'd better avoid the beach. First, coffee. - I won't say no. Can we drive all the way through the beach? - If not, we'll go back to the road. OK. What is it? The ocean. Arturo! What's up, Fede? We spotted you from the car. Your crazy ex came over yesterday. We didn't answer the door. She's at Susana's place, in Aguas Claras. Hi. - Nice to meet you. Sergio came out two months ago. - We've heard. Your crazy ex came banging on the door yesterday. She's at Susana's place, in Aguas Claras. Adriana and I spent the night there too. We meant to stay here a few days, you always invite us. This is the only acceptable room. When we arrived, the flooring was gone. It's leaking and the walls are wet. But Adriana and you can stay if you want. What do you do? - I'm a lawyer. We should've met before. You do bankrupts? - Of course. Do you know a Dr. Plaza? Víctor Raúl Plaza. A lawyer? - Yes. No, but only in Buenos Aires there are over 40.000 registered lawyers. Two years ago, I had three gas stations and a debt of almost 1 .5 million dollars. I had to go bankrupt and hired Dr. Plaza. Plaza had an agreement with the creditors' lawyer. They took me to the cleaners. It didn't matter Plaza had been recommended by Liliana's brother. Plaza and Talarico took everything, the creditors thought I was the fraud. They threatened me. I had to move out, change my number, but didn't work. I was a fugitive for a while. I even left the country. Fortunately, I pulled myself together and here I am. Where did you go? - To Perú. That's where I met Adriana. Is it "a Perú" or "al Perú"? That's the pizzas. I invested in health services. Two clinics: ophthalmology and orthopedic surgery. Twenty, right? - Yes, OK. Great pizza place, 30 flavors. All good, except for the seafood one. He likes it though. He says they're loaded up but it's only frozen mussels, cold inside even. They put them in the oven straight from the freezer. Mussels and cheese makes me sick, he loves it. We order for the week and freeze them. Then we cook them frozen to get them crispier. You can freeze Margherita but onion pizza must be fresh. Arturo cooked delicious mussels last night. - White wine, parsley and garlic. We could call them so they get ready to the casino. Yes. - You have your cell on you? I was rushing and took my cordless handset instead. I never take my phone on vacation. Vacations are sacred. So we can't call them. - No. Did you find them? - Yes. Are you all right? She just got up. Woke up at 3, had lunch, then back to sleep. Did you ask if we can stay there? - What did you do to them, Liliana? What did they say? - What happened? Adriana and I can stay but you can't. When you see them, tell them to go fuck themselves. You tell them. We're meeting them later at the casino. Or I could try to convince them. I'm ready to go now. Adri, are you in? - Upset stomach. But I'll go with you. The mussels. This way. You must know when to stop. We have these two beds. You know how to set it up, don't you? Thanks for everything. - Thank you. You're welcome. Sleep well. Who is it? - Liliana. Will it be much longer? What? Listen to the night. Breathe. It's like being in the countryside. We are in the countryside. Like being out in the open. I need the bathroom. Fede locked himself in. Can't you do it outside? What is it? - Fleas. We can switch. They are here too. - They didn't bite me. Finally! Who is it? - Fede? No, Sergio. Who is it? - Lili. Will it be much longer? Anybody there? Is there anybody in the bathroom? What happened? Put some ice on it. I don't want to go in the kitchen, they're there. I'll go. I have their numbers but no credit. Tell me. - Susana: 156-784-1302. No, she brought her cordless by mistake. How stupid. - Margarita: 154-222-7219. I think you should talk to her, Liliana. She's your friend. She's not my friend. I just got an email and replied. If it wasn't for her, we would be sound asleep. We are here only because of you. Margarita? This is Liliana. She hung up. Get off and ring the bell. Maybe her phone died. I won't. I called, now it's somebody else's turn. Susana, are you asleep? Don't even think about answering. The sun will be up soon. At this hour there's no traffic. We can be home in two and a half hours. We sleep there and come back tomorrow morning. A lot of gas money. But zero for the hotel. And I don't mind, I'm on holidays. Maybe this one has a room. - The minute you get off... ...one of those fleas will stick to the upholstery. When the animal is gone, the bugs feel abandoned... ...so they jump on the first thing. A person for instance. Liliana and I will get infested too. What for? You better stay here until the car is fumigated. Let Lili ask. Should I drive now? - It's fine, we're almost there. We'd better switch now. He looks a lot like Yago. The dog we lost. He even has the same eyes. It's a German shepherd. They all look the same. We also had a German shepherd. He ran away. How long have you had him? - Since he was a puppy. We bought him at a breeder's. I don't think a lost dog would turn up on the highway. If he's not Yago, he's just identical. They are too much alike. Like two peas in a pod. Maybe that dog and yours represent the same idea of a dog. Like Virgin Mary. There's only one but she has different identities. Our Lady of Fatima, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mary of Mercy... He didn't look like a stray dog, he looks too well-kept. He's not a stray dog anymore. We're quite far from your house. Some dogs can walk very far. Maybe he was found somewhere else and brought here in the van. It's pointless. I can't ring the bell and ask again. It's my word against his. He will deny it again. I'm ready. You? - Yes. I could go buy some bottled water while we wait. We can buy it on the road. Must be them. Seltzer? - Here. Please, fill out this form. When my mother came back from the beach, she moved into the apartment... ...and we moved into her house. That afternoon we found a duty-free bag by the door. Inside were shampoo bottles, moisturizers and sunblock, most of it used... ...a coffee cup and two stainless knives. There was also a note for my mom signed by Arturo... saying Adriana had stolen stuff from the beach apartment, and that he apologized. He knew she had that problem, but thought she was over it. He wasn't seeing her anymore. Later that day, Ezequiel thought he saw Ana again. They had left each other voice-mail messages but never met... ...and after some time, they just let it go. When he walked out of the theater, it was dark. He wasn't really sure it was her.
