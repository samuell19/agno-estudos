THE FILM YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. THE EVENTS OF CORNEILLE'S TRAGEDY, HORACE, WERE REPEATED IN TODAY'S PARIS. THE FABIANI AFFAIR This is a funeral like any other. The deceased was a baker like any baker. This man is a lawyer. This, a pharmacist. This man is unemployed. The people in the procession are like any others. Nothing sets them apart. And yet they are not quite like everyone else. They are citizens of a state within the state, with its own laws, borders, customs. They are Corsicans. This story, set in Paris, could take place elsewhere... anywhere 20 or 30 Corsicans are gathered together. These people don't know the deceased, but go to every Corsican funeral. They bring with them the air of their homeland, its sense of family and of honor. Of honor, especially. One of them is always named Napoléon. So my father's name is Napoléon. This is Antoine, my older brother. And me - Horace. Horace Fabiani. 27 years old. Corsican. Let's go, it might be us next. - What do you think? - Go ask Papa. - Is this serious? - Two deaths? That's nothing. - Did you recognize the shooter? - Go talk to Papa. I will. You coming? No, you go. Monique will be worried. Call me if you find out more, and even if you don't. Why the long face, Mr. Fabiani? - I just got back from a funeral. - That explains it. - Aside from that, how are you? - Fine. - Was it a relative? - A cousin. - A distant cousin, I hope. -Yes. So much the better, Mr. Fabiani. Take me: I don't like the dead. They scare me. A caretaker, if he's alive, is just a caretaker. But a dead caretaker is a mystery. And I don't like mysteries. - Like them? - Not bad. What do you mean, "not bad"? This is my finest collection! This silver one is quite popular. Shall I send you a dozen? Well, lovebirds? A dozen? Yes, if you like. - Anything else? - That's all for today. Fine. I won't insist. See you soon. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You seem upset. Something terrible happened at the cemetery. A man started shooting. Two people were hit. How dreadful! He must have been crazy. - Did you tell the police? - No. - You should have. The police get along without us. - You weren't hurt, though? - I was. Two bullets in the brain. No harm done, then. See you. - Did you behave, my little monster? - Hello, Papa. - Did Aunt Camille give you that? - Yes. - Hi there. - Hello, Noél. I'll park and be right back. Did you have fun? - What did you eat at Aunt Camille's house? - An egg and some ham. - I like eating at home better. - Good. - Did Uncle Noél have lunch with you? - Yes. He had a steak. Run and see Mamma. Give her a nice kiss. Noél was with you two the whole time? Yes. Why do you ask? No reason. Seen Papa lately? Visited him yesterday. You should go see him every now and then. He misses you, though he'd never admit it. You know him. I know. Proud as the devil! Since they named him Napoléon, he thinks he's an emperor. Don't talk that way. He loves you. And I love Noél. As long as Papa treats him as he does, he won't see much of me. Look at it his way: for Papa, Noél is still a Colonna. Not the husband he dreamed of. He had no right to dream for other people. And Aunt Felicia? 73, and still lively as a young girl. Antoine and Joseph send their love. You know Noél is a wonderful man. Yes, Camille. But Papa doesn't want to know. Stay here. I've got to get cigarettes. - I've got to talk to you, Noél. - In the street? Anywhere but not in front of the women. Really? I was just at the funeral for Rafael, the baker. Suddenly, right there in the cemetery, someone started shooting at us. And, as if by accident, César Fabiani was killed. — It can't be true, Horace! — It is. I'm glad you were having lunch with Camille. Why? Because that way I'm sure: whoever was shooting, it wasn't you. Good afternoon, madam. One day I must cut your hair, there's so much of it. Noél likes it this way. Silly girl. Like it? You can have it. You're very kind but I don't know if it suits me. Take a look. I didn't tell you what happened to Horace. In broad daylight, right in the city. At his cousin's funeral, a crazy man started shooting into the crowd. Two people were hit. It could have been Horace. Terrifying. Do you think it was that stupid vendetta? And so do you, but you're afraid to. It's so horrible. I can't believe it. A man's dead. It wasn't the wind that laid him out. - Have you heard anything from your people? - Not a word. It couldn't have been them. If someone shot at your family, you'd think: Fabiani. I have to think: Colonna. Swear that all your brothers were playing dominos at 2:00 today. I know nothing, I tell you. |I don't care about that old business. You and I are Corsicans, but we don't make a sport of it or a religion. Things can still be worked out. Antoine is at Papa's. Find out what you can. What a mess! - Things were going too well. - We haven't had this talk, remember. We had a drink together. - Noél, what's going on? - Nothing, darling. Nothing. - Hello, Jeanette. Is my father in? - You just missed him. Horace! My little Horace. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Let me hold you, my boy. Aunt Felicia, where did Papa go? He didn't say. Have a yogurt, Antoine. Your liver's delicate, like Napoléon's. The liver may be delicate, but a man's a man! That's my Horace. His two brothers are a little afraid of me. Even that crazy Joseph. But I can always make Horace laugh. Auntie, you're getting fat. You'll lose your figure. Those two are torturing me. Do they think I'm Zorro? They won't be happy until I arm myself to the teeth, and swear to wipe out every Colonna from the face of the earth. I don't care about the Colonnas. They're none of my business. You know what my business is. At the club, everything's on my shoulders: the games, the receipts, the restaurant. And smile, smile, smile. And my car's out of order. You'll have me crying. When I sleep with a woman, I'm happy, like anyone else. Then she falls asleep, and I see a great sadness come over her. She probably feels all alone in the world. And that breaks me up. Nothing feels good, Horace. Nothing. And that's... no good. Come on, I'll go with you. You found the time to get married. But my wife is Aunt Felicia. Going already? Not even a drink with your friends? I'm late. Parisians! Even if they're Corsicans, they're always in a hurry. Pick up Joseph on your way, and go see your father, the three of you. He'll be happy to see you. - Buongiorno. - Hello. - Is my father in? - No, not yet. - How's the crowd? - Starting to come in. Gentlemen, take your places. Mr. Antoine, storm clouds on the horizon. Take your places. The second hand's being dealt. - Hello. - Good evening, gentlemen. I always wonder why rich people bother gambling. They like to challenge fate. And if I didn't know Papa would boot me out of the club, I'd be a high roller myself! Don't get excited. It's not like I'm 70 years old... Here's the big cheese. Come on. It's Papa. - What's his mood? - The one that goes with his best gray suit. - Follow me. - Sir. What do you think - who was the shooter? - Their cousin Marc. - No. He's way out of town. Toto Colonna couldn't have paid his fare. But Mr. Toto has three sons, obedient boys, who'd let themselves be cut to pieces for him. And right now, Mr. Toto is very pleased with the oldest: Victor, who killed poor César. - Victor? - Are you sure? Laridy identified him: swore by his mother's life. And Pascal too. What do you say? César gave me a teddy bear, when I was five. I still have it... here. Well said, Joseph. César left a widow and two daughters. The Fabianis that remain to avenge him are all here in this room. - Is that clear? - Perhaps too much so. I agree, Horace. We're not in the maquis any more. We can read and write. Especially Joseph. But I'm 58, gray-haired, a businessman, too old for kicks in the ass. I felt that one. I can't sit down. Toto Colonna - you know him. A squalid little man, chattering with rage, in his grimy dive on the Rue de Douai. Knowing I made it to the Champs-Elysées drives him mad. It eats him up inside. For ten years he's fumed and drooled. Fine! But today, he's killed. I saw Noél and Camille. Noél knows nothing. That one, in his bar, never knows anything. All the time he's been living with Camille, he's never known there's such a thing as marriage. He's a nice guy. Listen. If I ever touch a Colonna without tongs, I'll give up this club. Get this: That pimp takes my daughter away, and I'm supposed to thank him? - Bravo! - Toto and he are two separate people. They're both idiots. Plus the two others, makes four idiots. - Antoine, call the Arc-en-Ciel. - You want to speak to Toto? Yes. Quick. Do you want to apologize? Good guess. Come on. I go to Horace's, completely unaware, and he's the one who tells me about it. At least warn me, if you're going to do something like that! You would have said not to do it. Of course I would have! We seized an opportunity. César had been hiding for years. He had to go to the funeral. Get that. Come on, Noél, do I have to do it myself? Hello? Yes. Yes. I'll see. Papa, it's Napoléon. The great Napoléon. What an honor. Will you take it? - You've got strong hands, Noél. - Will you take it or not? Let me breatherthe air of the Champs-Elysées. They're beautiful, Noél, the Champs-Elysées. The grandest avenue in the world. Especially seen from Place Clichy. Hello. Is that you, Napo? How are you? Of course. But... Who does he think he is? What did he say? - To congratulate Victor. - Bravo. Your hero was recognized. He won't live the night. What were you thinking? I was thinking of everything. Twenty people will say Victor was here all the time. You disgust me. This isn't the act of a man. The Fabianis have slapped my face for years. If I slap back, am I not a man? There are other ways. I live like I drive: I take the shortcut. Excuse me, Papa. - There's a guy asking for you. -I'm not in. - It's a police inspector. - That was quick. - What does he want? - To wish you Happy New Year! I told you I thought of everything, Noél. While Victor was at the cemetery, you phoned him here. Got that? All yours, Inspector. Mr. Colonna? Inspector Madelin. At your service, Mr. Madelin. Do you want to cause trouble for one of my clients? They seem to have enough trouble as is. They may be less elegant than those who play baccarat, but the principle's the same. That's not why I'm here. Do you know a César Fabiani? Vaguely. Come to the bar, we'll be more comfortable. A good man, César Fabiani. - Yes. Did you know... - I just heard. Unbelievable. In a cemetery! - Tell me, are you Corsican? - I'm from Lille. One of your colleagues used to handle our affairs. - Inspector Scaniglia? - Yes, from Calvi. He was highly qualified. - Perhaps too much so. He's in Vice now. - He must be bored, away from us. - Something to drink? - A beer. A beer and a Vichy fraise. I got this list from the prefecture. May I? 1952. Ange Colonna kills Pascal Fabiani. 1954. Dominique Fabiani kills Ange Colonna. 1955. Martial Colonna kills Dominique Fabiani. I'll pass over the others. The "good man" César Fabiani is down here as the killer of Jean Colonna. I wonder if this could be a vendetta. No offense, Inspector, but it's obvious you're from Lille. The vendetta is a thing of the past. It's folklore. Something to amuse the tourists. - These people died. - If you say so. But if one man from Normandy kills another, and a third kills the first, they're dead too. But you wouldn't call it a vendetta. According to you, now it's the turn of a Colonna to die. Just so. Like generals, decent people die in bed. And their children as well. Look at Victor, holding the cue there. A bit of a slacker, but a good fellow. At the door, there's To us saint. Handsome... everyone likes him. No crime in that. Over there's Noél. He runs a little bar near here. He lives with Camille, the daughter of my old friend Napoléon. - Really? - Sure thing. They fight your great vendetta between the sheets. Inspector, they've handed you a pack of nonsense. Nonetheless, I'd like to know where you were at 2:00 today. - Here. - And Messrs. Victor, To us saint, and Noél? Oh, they never go to funerals. They find them depressing. - You can check that. - I will, don't worry. Oh, I won't. No, it's on me. - Thank you. - See you out? - Don't bother. - No bother! It's just good manners. - Well? - All wrapped up. Yellow. Green. Triple payout. Okay, I'm going. Noél doesn't want to go along. He thinks too much. I do what I'm told. Otherwise there's no end to arguing. Everything I've done in my life, everything... it wasn't for me. It was for the three of you. - Say hello to Camille for me. - I will. You don't have to say anything else to her. Camille isn't like you all. You're right. She isn't like them. I told him what I thought. Toto didn't know what to say. I hate him. I don't. I never want to see him again. Never. Listen, Camille, we owe our happiness to him. Your father would have let us starve as a lesson for loving each other. I didn't need lessons. I love you. Don't hate anyone. You were put on earth just to kiss me. Forget this business. Mr. Fabiani, I don't understand. You're friends, you're relatives... and suddenly you die, violently. Something's wrong. Come in. I'd like you to take a look at this list. This is no list - it's a war memorial. Fabiani, Colonna. Colonna, Fabiani. If this is a coincidence, Mr. Fabiani, admit it's quite a coincidence! - Two names are missing here. - Really? Which? One Fabiani... and one Colonna, as it happens. Without this man, your list wouldn't exist. His name was Paul Fabiani. He was my cousin. Forget where you are, Inspector, and who you are. Picture it: Corsica, 1933. My cousin had just got up. The first thing he did was to go see his dog. Colonna! Colonna! For a dog? For months, he stayed hidden. Then, one day... Fabiani! Fabiani! Fabiani! Two years later, the killer crossed the sea. But so did all the rest. Oh, they killed him! That's the story. All that for a dog? He loved that dog. He would have killed for a flower, if he loved that flower. And you approve? I can't say it's wrong. You're not kids any more, neither you nor Colonna. Inspector! This is a fine office, but I have two kids that I can't feed on baccarat. I've got a job to do. And you can be sure I'll do it. - Good for you. - Thank you. Just don't bother calling me when the next Fabiani is killed. Mr. Fabiani. Yes? Put him on. Is that you, Jean-Marie? Hello. When? Yes, I'll be there. That will be 8. 35, madam. 8.35,9,10... - Hello, Mrs. Graziani. - Hello. There. - Thank you, madam. - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye. - I'll call Jean-Marie. - Please do. Jean-Marie, Mr. Fabiani's here. Just a minute, Napoléon. Go see Costa with this letter. And your medals. - You'll get your job at the ministry. - With a pension. - Desk work. - I'd like that, with my legs. - Varicose veins. - Waiting on tables was awful. No more of that for you. You can write to the village and tell them. Thank you. Hey, Napoléon... Sit down. Know why I asked you here? Because of poor César. Yes. You and the Colonnas have got to stop... or you'll still be killing each other a thousand years from now. I got a visit from a police inspector. So did Toto. - How do you know? - From Toto. He was sitting in that chair a quarter of an hour ago. I asked him here. He's at the Tuileries now, waiting to talk with us. We can't talk properly in a café. Suppose I refuse? You haven't the right. If you refuse arbitration, the Corsicans of Paris will send flowers. A lovely wreath. Come on, Napo, trust me. All right. I'm here to see this business doesn't go any further. -I agree. - He agrees. If he doesn't, why are we here? I wanted to see you again, Napo. We haven't seen each other for five years. Since Camille ran off with Noél. You don't look a day older. - The Champs-Elysées keep you young. - All right... My old Napo, you're a friend, so you don't want to say it. But it's true: I haven't improved with age. It's noisy in the Rue de Clichy. There's a bus stop right at my door. And my clients are scrawny. So scrawny I feel bad for them. - Why are you telling us this? - Napo understands. Look at him. He's not happy. My dream, Jean-Marie, was to open a nightclub. A tiny nightclub, at the very bottom of the Champs-Elysées. Napo did everything to stop me. Including dirty tricks. Not very nice, between countrymen. — That's not the issue. — Ah... If you're against me, I'll go home. Stay. I'm not against anyone, as you well know. Did you kill César to force my hand? For 30 years you've offended me with your fine suits. - Don't touch me. - Your apartments, your cars. Napoléon here, Napoléon there. Napoléon's club, Napoléon's money. I'm up to here with the great Napoléon. Who do you think you are, Toto? You'll have to content yourself with the raggedy losers betting 100 francs at your tables. - Hear him, Jean-Marie? - Green. Yellow. You'll hear it for the rest of your life, Toto. You'll pay for that, Napo, and dearly. And not with your money. César was something on account. But now it's all due, Fabiani! - Bastard! - Calm down! You hear? Calm down. I'm the arbiter. You've got an easy job, then. A revolver for each of us, and I'll kill him. That bastard! - Fine with me. - Not so fast. Am I in charge, or you two?? You, Jean-Marie. We're listening. My turn to talk. Do you think I'm an ordinary hardware merchant? No. I don't sell washtubs, that's my wife. In my presence, you're no bigger than two olives. More than 20 Corsicans have told me: "It's time they ended this business. Now they're shooting in cemeteries. They wounded a woman. At the next crowning of Miss Corsica, they'll be throwing grenades. And that will be good for everyone. " That's what they told me. And do you know what I told them? "It will come to an end. " Do you two want to fight? Yes. Why not? You don't want to shake hands? No. I want to kiss him. Then fight. Go ahead, fight. But you, you have asthma. And your heart's as irregular as a country clock tower. Beat each other at bocce. You'd be a laughingstock. I'm not laughing. I'll settle this once and for all. Each of you choose a son to fight a duel. Whoever lives, wins. Won't that do? My sons are men. - And if they refuse? - My sons are men. - No one gives a damn for your sons. - Be polite. It's the truth. And my sons - are they clowns? They're Fabianis! All right. A Fabiani against a Colonna. - Good. - Great. Be careful, Toto. The Fabiani will be armed. Unlike César. If my son had to go to war, I wouldn't hide him in the cellar. He'd go. What he'd do for his country, he should do for his family, no? The family is the most sacred of all. I approve. If you both feel this way, so much the better. At least there'll be no more talk. It'll be over. Is that your last word? Fine. You'll each send your oldest son. - Fine. - Why the oldest? He's next in line after you. But... Victor is a killer. - Antoine isn't... - Is this duel for the vendetta, or sport? You could just give it up, you know. Goon. Victor against Antoine. Look here. They'll hunt each other, in cars, tonight. Starting here. 11:00. See? The area between the Seine, Trocadéro, Etoile, Champs-Elysées, and Concorde. They'll never find each other. So much the better. That's their business. If they meet, they'll fight until the first blood is drawn. But if they don't meet by dawn, that's the end of the matter. I'll give you two hours for your answer. - You've already got my answer. - No. Better for you to give it some thought. One of you must be less stupid than the other. I spoke in the name of my family. Face to face with Napo, I represented the Colonnas. For better or for worse. - I know. - Don't worry. If they want war, they'll have it. This is for Antoine. Is this what you want? Victor will shoot you like a rabbit. I don't want anything. But if I must go, I'll go. I've never been exactly brave but I'm no coward either. It's cowardly to march into a slaughterhouse. Enough, Horace. This is my affair. If you refused, Antoine, I wouldn't be angry. I'll go. Maybe I'll be lucky. Don't count on it. Aunt Felicia, stop them. Can't you see what's happening? There's nothing women can do, once men take up arms. You can't do anything? But in other days, you could. Those were other days. And you? I'm sorry I'm not the eldest. I would have shown Victor. Well? No point in yelling, Horace. Antoine is free. Free to die for the glory of the Fabiani. Better to die like this, than of chronic humiliation. Well said, Joseph. It reminds me of something I've read on a poster: "When the parents drink, the children get the hangover. " Take that back, Horace, this instant! Don't be so surprised to see me here, Papa. I don't come here often, but today it was worth my while. - You and old Colonna are crazy! - You could say hello to me, first, and kiss your Aunt Felicia. What does Aunt Felicia think of this? She should have scratched your eyes out! She no longer has the nails for that. My Horace... I forgive you. You're an old woman. Antoine, stay here tonight, in your own room. - Did Toto send you? - You'd like that, admit it. I didn't even tell Noel I was coming here. Antoine, stay home. I'm begging you. He's not like you. He wants to keep his head high. And his toes turned up. My children, I can't back down. Whatever I have in life, I've won. I've paid for it, it's mine, and I'll keep it! Try to understand. When a man owns a bit of land, he puts a fence around it to protect it. That's what I've done. I'm trying to protect my family. No one can blame me for that. And you least of all. Listen, Papa. If you let Antoine go, you'll never see me again. Never. Go back to your bar. She didn't even kiss me. What are you doing? Where are you going? With Camille. To say Antoine has a migraine. Stay here. Horace. Felicia... I give up. Toto has won. They're all against me. I'm tired, Napo. I've been through so much. I'm glad my father is dead. At least he didn't see this. Now there are no Fabianis left. I was the last. And I didn't know it. I'm going with Antoine. What? I'm going with Antoine. No! No, my child. You're too young. Stay with your books. Antoine is my brother. I'm sorry, Papa, I must go with him. So much the worse for Victor. And the arbitration? I don't care about your arbitration. Antoine is my brother, I have to do this. We must tell Graziani, at least. If you like. Joseph... Shut up. You'll say anything. - A past is. - George, a past is for the gentleman. Sit down. I'm sure he'll understand. - How are you? - Fine. - Want a light? - Thanks. - Don't you want to know where I've been? - I can guess. - Horace came back with me. -Yes. Thanks, Horace. He wants to talk to you. Don't bother. There's nothing to say. I won't go to my father. Listen, Noél... All right, don't worry. You explained everything very reasonably to your father. But Napoléon wouldn't listen. Napoléon doesn't back down. You're hoping Toto will do it instead. - That's not it. - I understand, I'm not stupid. To save Antoine, you want me to tell my father: - "Papa, crawl like a bug. " - He's my brother... He's my brother. When I told them we wanted to get married, Napoléon threw me out like garbage. Joseph twiddled his thumbs. And your Antoine just smiled. Should he die for that? It's hard to forget. I've never forgotten. A little while ago, you wanted things settled. Not if it means making doormats of the Colonnas. You're as proud as my father. - And why not? - Be less stupid than he is. Do something. I beg you. Do it for me. Do you think my father will listen to me? And To us saint? And Victor? Napoléon's made us swallow our pride for years. Go anyway. We must try everything. I don't know. I love you, Noél. What of it? It's more complicated than that. - Mr. Noél, come down. - I'm busy. It's Mr. To us saint. I need to go. Well? Graziani just called Papa. Antoine won't be alone. Joseph will be with him. - What? - And the boy's a crack shot. This changes everything. - Horace is upstairs? - Never mind. Go home. I'll phone you. Good thing I didn't go see Toto. It's two against one, now. Joseph will be with Antoine. - You didn't tell me that. - We didn't know. You're a nice bunch, your family. Leave us alone, darling. I want to talk with Horace. Leave us. I'll see what we can do. Go tell them that against their two, we'll be three. That's all, Horace. Three against two. Don't forget it. Kiss Camille for me. With my Jaguar, that'll be all right. - What weapons do you have? - Hunting rifles. For Victor, that'll be fine. I'll show you how they work. But you won't have time to use yours. Bravo. Nice work. I've just seen Noél. There will be three of them. Three? Well... Then there will be three of us. See you tonight. Three against three is fairer. Those bastards Colonnas. But this will be the last time. I have friends ready to swear that you were playing cards with them all night. And tomorrow morning, when you come back, we'll drink champagne. I prefer café au lait in the morning. Papa! Papa! Papal Papa. Papa. Hello. You have a visitor. Come along, darling. Let Papa be. - Inspector Madelin. - Please sit down. I'll just be a minute. It's about the funeral. You were in the procession, I believe. The shooter hasn't been identified. But perhaps you recognized him. He was hidden behind the tombstones. Behave yourself, I'll be right back. Hello? Oh, it's you. A game of poker? Yes, fine. What? Oh, right... We'll meet tonight, 10:30, Place de 'Alma. All right. See you soon. Antoine invited me to play poker with him and Joseph. I thought you had enough of cards. You really have nothing to tell me, Mr. Fabiani? No, I don't think so. We won't find each other, 1 tell you. We can't possibly find each other. Graziani is crazy. - If you do run into them? - We'll turn tail. Would your brothers do that? Why not? You're all I have. I don't care about the others. You're all I have. It'll all work out, you'll see. Stay, Noél. Stay with me. No, my love. I can't. The inspector said the shooting was a vendetta. Worse than that. It's the Hundred Year War starting again. Look, darling. We're in Paris. Not the maquis. You Corsicans are strange. You're right. I have a hairdressing salon and a television, 1 go fishing, and I love you. - How strange I am. - Did you say "I love you"? Yes. Me too. Don't I get a kiss? It's time for children to go to bed. Good night, Papa. Come along, sweetheart. Will you buy me some chewing gum tomorrow? If you behave. Philippe hit me in the nose again. You began it. But he wouldn't play with me. Do you need anything, Antoine? Nothing. Thank you. Keys. Okay. Papers. I'm putting this here. Bullets. See? This will be our backup car, just in case. Remember where it's parked. You drive. Know where the gears are? First gear top, second down... You're doing me a big favor. Thank you again. Nonsense, Napoléon, it's our pleasure. Cut, Antoine. It will be fine, you'll see. Everything's set. - Yes, Mr. Colonna. - I can't tell you any more, but everything's been arranged. My sons will be back before dawn. Yes, Mr. Colonna. Before dawn. The chief cracks me up. A case like this comes around in Paris every 10 years. Corsicans... just try getting them to talk or giving them advice. They're quiet, decent, God-fearing... then, all of a sudden, for a matter of honor, or family, or justice... they're off and nothing can stop them. If I only knew where they were. Go. Put the radio on. - Pity to run them over. - Not my type. The taller one looked like a girl I knew once. I'll never forget her. Blond hair... Running my hands through it was like being at the beach. And her eyes... Violet. With long black lashes. And her bosom... you should have seen it. Like a sculpture. A work of art. And long, long legs... with rounded thighs. Smooth as water. Soft under the hand. Kiss me. Turn around. This is the boundary. The game is hiding, gentlemen. The game is afraid. -In a hurry? - No. But all I see is asphalt disappearing behind us and red lights turning green. I wouldn't like to go back empty-handed. I wouldn't mind. - Shall we take the tunnel? - No, go over. That's it, ladies and gentlemen, we've done our round. Here's the restaurant, its lights, and Mr. Horace's car. Are we going to go around like this all night? If we don't see anyone in the next hour, we'll go home and have a drink. Eh, Horace? I'm thirsty. Isn't that Toto's car? Pull up, Horace. On the left. It's a shame not to get anything. Try the side streets. Turn it off. Let's go back to the Champs-Elysées. They'll pass by sooner or later. This time it's them. Speed up, Horace. They're getting away. Speed up. I'll have to shoot low. We'll lose them. No, they'll be waiting for us. That's it. Go. What are they doing? Look out behind you. - Don't be afraid. - Antoine... Don't be afraid. Shoot. Shoot! Shoot! Keep moving, Joseph's hurt. Can't - the tire's flat. We can't stay here. Get out. We've got to change cars. This one's damaged. Me too. - What's wrong? Can you walk? - Yes. Sort of. Come on. - Are you hurt? - I'm okay. Go see what they're doing. Joseph, talk to me. Joseph! Stay with him, I'll get my car. Horace wasn't there. There he is. - Slow down. - What should I do? Too many people. Follow him. — I'll go. — No, let me. Turn the car around. Wait. Haven't things gone far enough? - Victor is wounded. - Victor can die like a dog. And you with him. Antoine and Joseph are dead, but this isn't over. You all are scum. And Camille is a whore. - What did he say? - He wants to go on. I'm hurt bad, Noél. We'll take care of you right afterwards. I can't hold on. Get me to a hospital. Stay still. We're on our way. - Noél... - He must have gone left. Forget about him. We've got to take care of Victor. We lost him. I can't see him anywhere. Go, find a pharmacy. Hear me? Bastard! He's following us. Stop. - What's he after? - Get going. He'll shoot us when we get out at the hospital. Noél... I'm dying. Stop! Come back. He'll shoot! Horace! Get out. Get out, if you want to fight. Come here. Victor is done for. Happy? Shoot! Shoot, if you dare! Here I am. I'm not afraid. Horace! Do you hear me? Get out, you coward! Noél! Noél! - Get out, if you're a man. - He'll kill you. Come here! Noél... Hang on, Victor. - What'll you have? - Anything. A cognac. Look out for your car, Mr. Horace. They're ticketing. I don't care. Let them hurry up and kill me. Get this lousy luck: I bet Medusa... Antoine and Joseph Fabiani. Hello, Station 37. Station 37. Officer Nobler here. We've just found the bodies of two men... Let's go. Camille. Camille. Horace! I was afraid, Camille. And Noel? Noél, where is he? He's dead. Tell me the truth. Yes, Camille. Oh no! Don't say that, Horace! No, it can't be! If you knew how Antoine and Joseph were killed. So it was you. It was you, Horace. Why did you do it? Tell me why you did it, Horace. Tell me! Go away! Camille... It hurts. Hurts. Leave me alone. Alone. God, have pity on me. I didn't want all this. When they judge me tomorrow, I won't be able to explain. We fight, for a country, a religion, an ideal... and when we start, we must go on. Until everything is destroyed. Everyone is dead. Like me... Horace.
