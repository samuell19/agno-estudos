TERROR EXPRESS Platform 13. Anna, we have to go. Do we really have to make this trip? You said yes, didn't you? I'm begging you... let's not start all over again. Anna... Yeah, at the same time. Tomorrow evening. Try to be there. Are you finished, miss? What did you say? Please. It's very urgent. Alright. Do whatever you want. No, no, I'm not angry. I'd rather have you come to my place. - Are you finished soon? - No! Miss, please. Save yourself the trouble, he won't marry you anyway. Yes, I'm nervous because of this. Give it up, dolly. He's a brute. - Bye! - Very good, very good. - Now, who wanted to use the phone again? - Not me. And you? Me neither. I reserved a double in the middle for you. - Are there many people on the train? - Pretty much. I'll take it. - Where is Elena? - Over there. Always on the phone. She's probably calling her latest fella again. Get off her back. She's not doing anything bad. It would be nice if you could tell her once and for all... - that I don't approve of this relationship. - You don't like it. Okay, I'll tell her that. - Guido. - Yes, sir? Go buy me some magazines. You know which kind. - Yes, darling... - Elena! - Come on. The train is about to leave. - I'll be right with you, Dad. Make it quick. Hugs and kisses! Bye! Give me all the porno magazines you have. Taking reservations for the dining car. Taking reservations for the dining car. Giulia? Take it. Taking reservations for the dining car. Come in. Good evening. Dinner will be served in 15 minutes. Would you like to make a reservation? No, thank you. But please wake us at 6 a.m. Mom, please order something. I'm famished. - Daddy, please. - Alright, alright. I'm hungry, too. - Book a table for three. - Very well, sir. - Your name is? - Sini. Here you are. Have a nice evening. - You didn't forget the doctor's reports, right? - Of course not, they're in the bag. Tell me the truth. This trip to Switzerland won't help me either, right? Everything will be fine, you'll see. - I'm going to die... - Aw, don't you say such nonsense, Maw. You will be back on your feet very soon. Come in. Would you like something for dinner? No, thank you. I'll stay here. You go, darling. - No, no. I don't want anything either. - As you wish. - Have a good night. - Thank you. Yes? Dinner is in the dining car... Would you like to make a reservation? Excuse me, it's about dinner. Would you like to reserve a table? - No. - Wait a minute. - What's for dinner? - Young wine and international cuisine. Alrighty. Book us a table for four. - You said for four? - Yeah, I did. But where is the fourth? - He's dead. - Excuse me? - We eat... - we play... - and we sleep... - always with our dead fella. Of course. Alright, gentlemen. That's fine with me. A table for four persons. Beer! Alright, man! Beer! They're mad. Just a bunch of knuckleheads for me. At least they're good-humored. What a youth... Go on. I'm coming. - Yes, gentlemen? - Sit down. - At the table? - Please. Thank you. - Who's the fourth place for? - Excuse me, gentlemen... but you ordered for four. I mean, the three of you... How shall I put it? - Ah, the decedent! - Exactly. Oh, how terrible...! A regrettable misunderstanding. That was just a harmless and humble joke. - English... - black-humored. So, general, get rid of this stuff. Very well, gentlemen. It was a misunderstanding. - The chair as well, yes? - Certainly, sir. The chair and the stuff. All of it. What a mess. There's no one around to open the window. - Why don't you give it a shot, daddy? - Elena, stay out of this. - Would you have the music turned down? - Certainly. Gentlemen, would you turn the volume down a little, please? Gentlemen, just a bit, please. Just a little, yes? There. That's no reason to get upset. Believe me. Your Prince Charming is just like those guys back there: Neurotic and maladjusted. Elena, I don't want to interfere, but please think it over. Alright! Will you turn the damned thing down now, or what? There! That's the demarcation line. The breakpoint. The abyss. The abyss that separates our two generations. The abyss, right. The music! The music is the living proof for the march of time. Bravo. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Good, then let's go. And where? To the dining car. That's your right according to an international convention... concerning the rights of the convict in case of extradition to a foreign country. - And where am I escorting you to? - To Germany. Well, if I'm not mistaken, then Germany's a foreign country. - Come on. - With these? Are you ashamed? - I find this rather tasteless. - Stop that nonsense. You even find that imbecility of those morons back there tasteful. - That's totally absurd! - Don't scream like that, or I'll leave. - Your aperitif, sir. - I didn't order any. Compliment of the house. - Here's the menu. - Thank you. Hey... look who's coming. Cute. Our company makes its credit transactions medium- as well as long-term terminated. On the basis of the investment plan, the following proceedings were approved: Reinforcement of the production as recommended by expert's committee... and the increase of the liquid assets as determined by the board of directors. - How old are you? - Nearly 23. Did you know that I have a son your age? How did you get yourself into all this trouble? Didn't you read my trial reports? I'm a cop, not a lawyer. But you're asking me the same questions as they do. - That's what they call destiny. - Oh well... I must confess that I was hoping to see you again. - Who was on the phone? - Just mind your own business. Excuse me. Would you like to order something, madam? No, thanks... Oh, an espresso. And I'd be very thankful if you would ask this gentleman to leave. Didn't you hear her? An espresso. And now, take a hike. Would you please go back to your table I'm about to serve dinner. I'm sorry, but I think I have to do as he says. Otherwise, this jerk will ruin my entire evening. Bye. I could eat better without these things. Don't you think? - You want the keys? - I don't even need them. All I need is the fork and 10 seconds' time. You wanna bet? Stay calm, ladies and gentlemen. Stay calm. That was merely a small and banal accident. Provoked by the force that dictates a human's destiny. A mysterious force. Cynical... and cunning. Clean it, slave. Spick and span. - It has to shine. - That's enough! Why don't you throw them out? Stop acting like clowns if you want to stay! It was just a little joke. How did David Schumann put it? "Man is in this world to play and to loathe." David is him... a poet. - Behave like decent citizens. - Why don't you start, mister? - As a good example? - Anna, please let it rest... Shut up. Let me talk. Would you explain that to me? The presence of a convict is an insult. You have no right to impose his presence on us. The lady is absolutely right. That's definitely an unacceptable burden. Pierre. Excuse me, gentlemen. If you wish, I will have your dinner served in your compartment. - Sandwiches and fruits. - Very well, sir. You're angry, huh? Don't be upset. But I told you so. With these around your wrists it's like you had the plague. No matter if you're guilty or not. I assure you, even though those three aren't wearing cuffs... they're no better than I am. Valued offsprings of degenerated nouveau riches. Anti-social. Fine clothing, good manners and absolutely empty in the brain-department. It's open. Good evening. Good evening. You're truly pretty. Very pretty. And also costly. My price is 100,000. Of course. At once. Don't you count it? Oh, what wonderful organization. Exotic photos, even. That's you, right? Why don't you take your clothes off? Come here. Let's watch the pictures together. Beautiful. Do you like that? I find it naive. Full of poetry. I'm delighted. You could definitely show more fire. You want me to say "I love you"? Anna, don't you want to go to bed? No, I'm not tired. Just go to your compartment and leave me alone. Anna, please. - Please... - Cut it out! Don't be so nervous Relax. You'll see, by the time this trip's over, we'll have it together again. Don't count on it. Excuse me. Thank you. Yes? Excuse me. I'd like to prepare the beds. Please come back later. My boss can't sleep. As you wish. I'll be back later. Good evening. You called for me? Would you bring me a bottle of mineral water? I'll bring it right away. Listen. Non-carbonated and not too cold. Very well, sir. - There's a pretty girl outside. - You're still the same, lsac. Don't be offended, but I'd like to ask you a delicate question. Ask. Did you ever cheat on me during our marriage? - What gave you this idea, Mary? - Not even once? - But that's absurd. - Would you swear it? I find this conversation rather ridiculous considering our age. Maw! Here, take it. One non-carbonated mineral water for number 6. And not too cold. - Is something wrong? - No, no. It's fine. I just can't sleep on trains. Even though I've been working for the rail road for years, I'm still not used to it. - I know how you feel. - But I do have a proposal for you... how you could pass the time in a pleasant fashion. And how? - There's a girl willing to... - Hey you! Yes, sir? - Come here. - Very well. - Excuse me. - Sure. I'm at your disposal, sir. What's the number of the blonde, who was sitting here earlier? - Are you interested? - Not me, but my friend. - Your friend would like to get to know her? - From the outside and the inside. You will have to be a little patient, the girl is, how shall I put it? Occupied at the moment. - But my friend is very impatient. - I understand, but it's impossible. - Why so pessimistic? - Well, okay. Precious. What are you up to with that thing? To clean my nails. Where's David? He's chilling in the kitchen. Want some coffee? There's fountains of it. Good idea. - Good night. - Good night. Lisa. Lisa! Aren't you sleeping yet? I'm not tired. - That's because it's so hot in here. - I'm sweating like a pig. - Why don't you pull off your nightgown? - You're right. Look the other way. - Sleep well, daddy. - Sleep well. The photos are on the couch. You can look at them, but make it quick. I have no interest in photos like that. Would you put that on for me? It's a silk nightgown. Soft and perfumed. If you want... I'm willing to pay you more. Good evening, curly. I have to thank you for your brave intervention. - You saved us from an embarrassment. - Yeah, you're right, David. She really saved us from an awkward situation. - And you know why? - Because she's so beautiful. Because she's got personality. Alright, boys. I saved you. Good night. - That's not the way it works, girl. - Your husband is a very lucky man. Now it's about to get ridiculous! We're actually willing to risk some more. So much more. - What's your name? - Giulia. No, your name is Elena. Is that right? You're Elena? Yes, I'm Elena. Elena... Elena... Elena... my darling. No! No...! Who the hell is that? Don't worry about it. Let him knock. Open the door! Open the door! - Damnit! Ask who's there. - I don't want to. Open the door! Open the door! Here. Why don't you go out there and confront him? Keep your voice down. Open the door! Sir, what are you doing? You're wrong here. - This is not your compartment - Fuck off! - Please, stop it. - Then tell your whore to open the door! - I'm sick of waiting! - But you're drunk! - Go back to your compartment! - Don't make me lose my patience... you Pimp I'm paying. I don't want to screw her for free. You're creating a disturbance. Please go back to your compartment. I told the whore to open the door, or I'll kick it in! - Stop it! - What's going on? - Go back to your compartment, right now. - Since you're getting so personal... I have a good advice for you: Don't get on my tits! You go back to your compartment, now. The kid's just tired and drunk. No! I'm not tired! And I'm not drunk either! And you... And you, pig, piss off before I throw up all over you! - Where are you going? - To the dining car. What was going on there? I heard my friend shouting. Why is that? He's a little nervous. Maybe I should get him some sleeping pills. - Elio! - Where are the other two? Why don't you ask his wife? Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna! Anna... My God... You're a filthy pig. Do you need any help, madam? Aren't you feeling well? Elio! Nico! Take him to his compartment and tie him up. - Is it possible to block the emergency brake? - Why? Yes or no? There. If you behave yourself, we might let you split at the next station. And no funny stuff. - How can I lock the doors? - This is the master key for all doors. Lock yourself in! Nico! Elio! You lock the waiter in the kitchen. You lock the other door. And nobody makes a move! If anybody moves, I'll snuff him! Did you hear me? You fuckin' pig, get out! Get out now! Had some fun, you bastard? You cheated on your wife! Now tell your wife, how much you shelled out for that whore! Here's your faithful husband! Ask him why he prefers humping whores. - In there, all of you! - But this belongs to Elena. You pig! You're 8 Pig! Now it's my turn. How much for the ride? No way. The store's closed for the night. Why? I will never do it with you. - But I'm paying well. - You wanna hear the truth? You disgust me. If this fine lady won't stop bitching... I'll go looking for another one! Don't be scared, dolly! Get out! We'll see if you're still so innocent! Look at this angel! Look, how it shivers! Take a good look! - You too, my dear lady! - Help me! Look at her, your sweet daughter! Off with it! - She'll be the next victim! - No! No! David! David! We're in business! The whole fuckin' train is in our hands. All we need to do now is to wait and have fun. Calm down now. There's no need to be scared. There's really nothing to be afraid of. What are they up to now? They're sitting in the compartment drinking beer and playing dice. Damn bastards. We could try a surprise attack. I mean, if we all attack their compartment... Oh no! You must be crazy. They have a gun. I won't risk my neck for a prostitute. Isn't it possible to stop the train or contact another car? No, I'm sorry. There's no other way than giving him this girl. Convince her. - That won't be easy. - And why not? It's basically her profession. Offer her enough money, and she'll go for it. I doubt that. If it's a matter of pride, then break it! You can't demand that, Anna. Isac, what is going on here? - What was all that shouting about? - They're all nervous folks. They've had a drop too much. - I feel a pain in my chest! - I'm getting your medicine. You'll feel better right away, you'll see. Giulia, I'm speaking for everyone. This is 500,000. That's a nice sum. - It's all yours. - That's way more than my usual rate. - You want your percentage for that, too? - Cut it. How much does she want? 600? 800? How much? Tell that crazy paranoiac that people like him ought to do it with animals only. - Giulia... - Out! Yes? Signorina, I beg you, do something. Otherwise my daughter will have to go She's only 18. - You're Elena? - Yes, miss. Go now. A nine. I won. Hey... The divine one. Nico... Get out and have an eye on the others. Sit down. Stop. Take a good look. Pretty soon it's your turn. - I think, sir... - No, no. It's alright. - I wanted to tell you... - You didn't get anything. You have absolutely no talent when it comes to economic issues. - Where are those three? - Having fun with the girl. They cut off our wagon and the dining car. And they blocked the emergency brake. If I can't stop them before we reach the next station... they will bail. Listen. You told me earlier that you can unlock the handcuffs in 10 seconds. - You have 5 minutes. - Yeah, but why should I? They'd shoot you like a rabid dog. - Unlock the cuffs! - They will kill you. And when you're lying on the floor in your own blood... all those goody two-shoes out there will say: - "What an idiot, this cop!" - Pierre, unlock the handcuffs! I'm sorry. I lied to you. I can't do it. This is not over yet, my darling. And stop crying, dummy. Everyone out! Everyone out! Come on! Come on, come on! Here's the little lamb that will satisfy your hunger. She'll be at your disposal for the rest of the night. A hot and horny virgin! Available for man and woman! Dig in, folks. And enjoy! Enjoy without shame! Stop it, and let her go! Now listen to him. Don't you like her? Do you prefer your wife? Your wife, who's so decent and faithful. Beyond any doubt? Stop it! Hadn't you had enough already? You stay out of this! Hadn't you promised us a little something? - I'd like to accept that. - Help yourself. The charity ball's in there. Drink this. - Thank you. - No problem. Relax. Nobody will harm you... for now. - They'll get you too, you'll see. - No. What a sight for sore eyes. I didn't let you in here, to play the nanny. - Or are you one of those? - What kind of beasts are you? Grab his hands! Now you can have her back. That wasn't necessary. You knew those three were crazy pigs. - At least they let off some steam. - It was totally pointless. - They will carry on. - But I had to try. It could have ended even worse. Why did you do that? Because of you. The last time someone tried to defend me... I was 13 years old. It was my mother. She tried to keep my father from hitting me. Did you nibble too much marmalade? - We didn't have any. - Then why? I decided to become a nun. - What's your name anyway? - Giulia. - I'm Pierre. - What did you do? - I neither killed nor stole. - So? Something political. Are you into that? - Me? - Did you study? Someone knocked me up when I was 16. And he scrammed. And you're alone? I have my mother and 6 brothers. My father's dead. All he left us was misery, and - how shall I put it? - a great inner desperation. So I gave up my plan with the convent and went hooking instead. Nobody dared to put obstacles in my way ever since. - Now I understand. - What? Why everyone is so angry with you. - Because you're proud. - Yes, I'm proud. I pick my clients. And if anybody wants me at all cost, I don't want him anymore. Can't stand that. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. If I stay and they come back, I'll jump at them again. - So you're real stubborn. - Yeah. Yes, yes. - Did I hurt you? - No. Not really. And now the game starts. - What's the price? - Your daughter, sir. What? Sit down. Three. Five. Your turn. - 10. - A darling of fortune. Bravo. Shall I throw it for you? Two. Your turn. - Eleven! - I won! - I won. - Sure. Congratulations. No... You're not the winning type. Elio won. Take it easy, that's life. - Evening. - Thanks for what you did earlier. Oh, no, no, no, no, no... Tell me, don't you feel hot as well? Yeah, it's really hot. Would you like to... have a refreshing drink with me, huh? Yeah. - Give me the drops! - But you already took some! Didn't you hear the doctor? No more than three a day. You mustn't get so excited. Try to get some sleep. I won't make it, lsac. It's over soon, you'll see. It's just a little fit of nerves. Excuse me, gentlemen. My wife isn't feeling well. She desperately needs a doctor. Gentlemen, please. For the love of God! Do something! Don't let her die! You old knucklehead, it's no use crying around here. None of us is a doctor. So beat it! One moment. You're the old knucklehead! - How dare you insult this man? - Shut up! His wife is sick, maybe even dying... ...and you dirty pisshead are making fun of him! - Shut it, you idiot! - That's enough! ' Shut up! - Get up! You dirty old geezer, you crook, you rotten bastard... you perverted pig, you stinking heap of shit! You can consider yourself fired! You're totally drunk. Get off me! Anna, you mustn't treat me like this. - You're my wife, and I want you. - Stop pestering me! Now go! - But I love you... - No! - You're mine! You're mine! - No! No! - You only belong to me. - Let go of me! Why are you fucking those bastards, but not me? Why? Why? - Why? - Let go of me! Leave me alone No... No! No! No... Pierre. - What's that? - The train's slowing down. The train's slowing down! Why, steward? We're stopping at a station. Maybe another train needs to go by. You think it'll stop? - I don't know. - If the train stops, there'll be trouble. Why? Because they'll get scared. That would make them even more dangerous. Out! Out, all of you! Nico! Lock them into their compartment! Go! Faster! Now , come on! Get in! Everybody in there! Faster! You too! Come on! Go! Elio, go and check the compartments! Come on, miss, out! The train might stop. One peep and everybody dies. Got it? - I just don't know... - And nobody moves! - Where is Elena? - I don't know. - Tell me where she is! - I don't know. I don't want to hear another word! Understand? Calm down, Maw. You don't need to be afraid. Lock yourself in, and don't open for anybody. No matter what. I'm begging you. Will we see each other again? Yes. Where have you been? I'll control this part, you go to the old-timers! - Are you ready? - Yes. As soon as I'm out there, you jump. Giulia! No! One more peep, and I'll waste you! You will now go to the compartment, where the others are and stay there. Got it? Piss off! Mary... - Shut it, and go over there. Go! - But I... Shut up! No! It's rolling again! Rejoice, my friend. We're rolling! Get out! Oh my God... You're such a moron. Couldn't you be more careful? Now we have a stiff on our hands. We gotta get out at the next station. - Where's Nico? - I saw him pass here. - Where did he go? - This way. Go and look for him! Quick! David! Nico must have gotten off while the train was stopping. - The door's open. - Take a look at the dining car! Get out! You, out! Go to the end of the corridor! Hurry! Turn around! Freeze! This is the end of the line for you. You have to get off... in hell. The fork. Did you see? In just 5 seconds. And with only one hand. Come back in. Pierre... Lay back. Pierre...
