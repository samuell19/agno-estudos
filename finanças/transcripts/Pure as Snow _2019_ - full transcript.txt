Pure As Snow (Original Title: Blanche Comme Neige) - Are you okay, honey? - Fine. It looks good. Did I not ask for apples? There aren't any. I ordered Granny Smith. Not Granny Smith. Green gives bad luck. Something red or pink. Pink Lady, maybe? I love Pink Lady. I'll order Pink Lady instead. We are not going to get towels from Lambert anymore. They are scoundrels. Mercier costs the same and lasts longer. - I'll take care of it. - As your father said ... "You have to know how to do everything." I try to do the job correctly. "Correctly", how sad. Your father didn't like lazy people. You have to forget the last few months, which were tough for all of us. Try to get out a little. I'll consider it. You're like a daughter to me. Young, beautiful. You have your whole life ahead of you. You should have fun. 26b 00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,877 - How are you, Claire? - It's all right. You're really pretty. It's a pity for you. You would not be here if this wasn't the case. Come on ... Close your eyes. You will not feel anything. Where are my sweatpants? In the washing machine. I took off your clothes. You were soaked. I dried you. You needed it. How did you end up here? Is she dead? It's me who asks the questions. I do not know ... No idea. You have to remember something. I'm so sorry... You are sorry? I went out hunting wild boar. I killed a woman instead. You should be sorry. Do you know what trouble I'm in because of you? We have to call the police. Yes, definitely. I've already been inside. Forget the police. I have nothing in your size. My name is Pierre. When can I get them again? What? My jogging pants. Is that your biggest concern? When they are dry. And until then? Don't you have a name? Claire. The bathroom is on the right. I have left a fresh towel. Hi there. This is Maud Jacob-Guillaume. Please leave your message. It's unbelievable, it can not be true. Where did they put my inhaler? It can not be true... Have you taken it? I have asthma. I can feel an attack on the way. So... By the way, how did you get in here? I do not know. I like that. When people know nothing. Today, everyone knows everything from Google, Wikipedia and all that crap. But I want to know where they put my inhaler because ... Should I have Damocles' sword hanging over my head? - Vivaldi. Was it you? - No, I'm not Vivaldi. Vivaldi is dead. It was me who played Vivaldi's music. I have lived here for three years and worked on my music. I was in an orchestra in Grenoble. I was born there, but Grenoble is unbearable now. It is one of the most polluted cities in France. - Did you know? - No. Now you know, Claire. The name Claire suits you. You're pale. I actually like pale women. The chubby ... The ones that Renoir and Rubens liked, I think are scary. Excuse me. How are you, Chernobyl? Well? Come here, come. Help me. Hold him. - What should I do? - Hold him. He's been tired lately. I hope he does not have Lyme disease. Is it red? It is highly contagious to humans. Have you been to the doctor? Is that a joke? Honestly? Doctors only prescribe what the big drug companies say they should. Here, disinfect your hands. Come ... if you allow me. A little bit. It does not take much. Also between the fingers. Like this. What are you doing here? Who are you? François. Get dinner ready. Fine. We have to talk. You can not stay here. - Why not? Those who are after you may come here. Nobody knows I'm here. Yes, so far. Let me stay a little longer. No, it's not possible. I did not ask you for help. You helped anyway. And now you're throwing me out? Yes, it does not make sense, but I don't have any other choice. Okay. Come on now, you have to go! God damn! Are the twins out? They are at the sawmill. - Come on. - Are you going out too? Do you not like being alone? Do you have claustrophobia? I had it, but I got over it. I'm taking the dog to the vet. Come with me. I can see you are going through a difficult phase. Just calm down, don't worry. I'm discreet. So? Your dog is healthy and well. You are kidding, he has no energy! Stop it, don't pull him like that. It's you who depresses him. I have antidepressants for dogs. - Oh, i get it. - What? Immediately the chemical straitjacket. - What's next? - It is natural. Plants. - I'll have them tomorrow. - Okay. I'll have to check Echenoz's sheep. It's close to you. - I can make a stop. - Okay. Do you live there too? At the house, I mean. Yes. Very well. See you tomorrow then. Make sure he eats well. Go for walks with him and play some cheerful music for once. Ok. I did not get a hold of ... My name? Claire. No, your relationship. Are you ... together? - No not at all. - We are not. Nonsense. Claire arrived yesterday. I do not even know how ... she came here, so ... Not at all. One two three. - Here we go. - Beware. Carefully! I didn't mean to offend you. Offend me? When... When Sam thought ... that you and I ... I try to avoid women, I am incompatible with them. Just so you know. - I'm not a homosexual, that's not it - That I understood. - Of course. It is better for health to be abstinent. Are you kidding me? I deserve it. Forgive me, I'll buy a drink at Georgette to make it up to you. Do not say no or I'll be offended. Well? Of course. Sorry, I have to stop and pick up some music scores. Come in. - Hello. - Hello. Let me introduce Claire. Father Guilbaud, Charles. My good God. - A vision. - Calm down, Charles. Miss... In the presence of such great beauty and grace I can only bow. What can I say? I kneel down. Like the shepherds in front of the Virgin of La Salette. Fine Charles, that's enough. It's the only bookstore here ... Exactly. Are you on vacation? You must visit our regional treasure, the sanctuary of Notre-Dame de La Salette. You will find out the heartbreaking story ... about Our Lady in tears. I can be your guide. What do you think? No? No pressure, it's just an introduction ... for meditation. Immersion. Charles, it's almost blasphemy. Not at all, father. I have no hidden motives. What about my music scores? What? Music scores? Of course, I have them here. Pardon me. Where did I put them? Thanks. Well. Do you like Brahms? It is for you. Here you go. Thank you. I do not want to harass you. I may seem a little weird, but I'm completely normal. Maybe I'm not that normal. You don't know me, you don't know who I am. - Are you going to introduce me? This is Claire, it's Claire. Georgette? Georgette took off three years ago. I'm Muriel. Cheers. Have you always had poor health? Since I was born. I was always sick as a child. I've had everything. Everything. My parents gave me bizarre things that were supposed to heal me, but in fact they were to see me die. Music saved my life. It's weird. - Do you think so? - No, not really. When I was a kid, music meant everything to me. Violins. - And you stopped? - Yes. It's a crime. Do you know... You always have to finish what you start. I was in a car accident when I was 13. I wasn't hurt. My mother was driving. It was her... I gave up. Everything, not just the violin. It was as if my life was over. I wanted nothing. I am very touched by what you have said. Deeply touched. But that was then. It's forgotten now. Like it has been deleted with a large eraser. And now... Now I'm a blank page. Here... I have something for you. It's a rehearsal violin. I bought it second hand and never used it. - It's been waiting for you. - I appreciate it, but I can not. Keep it, give it a try. I can not play the violin. Thank you. - Why did you take her into town? - Why not? How about keeping a low profile? Now everyone knows a girl lives here. Well done. Do you want me to leave? Do you like it well done? Not too much. Thanks. May I have the salt? Who can it be? How is he? Has not improved. I have the pills with me. Okay Put one capsule into his food with each meal. Ok. It's bitter, so add a little sugar. I don't use sugar, I'm going to buy some. But only with the meals. I'll take care of it, give him everyting now. So that he calms and gets better. - Okay. - Come on, Chernobyl. - Well then. - Come on. He always does that. His dog does not have anything. What about you? Are you here... to work? - Holiday? - Neither. It is a coincidence. That was lucky. How long have you been here? For three years. Three years. I'm originally from Macon. I had my practice there. Life was good. Then I met a woman. She came to have her cat neutered. All that stuff. Typical vet stuff. It was love at first sight. - Has it ever happened to you? - No. It's best that way. I do not know why I'm telling you that. I... I should not talk about it. I can not handle it. Now life is peaceful, perfect. That's just what I need. No stress, no anxiety. - No passion. - It's there, a healthy kind. It is city life that corrupts people. They become... They become greedy, hysterical. They are never satisfied. It is proven. I am thirsty. Do you want something to drink? François? Pierre cannot know. You're really sick. Yes I know. I couldn't resist. You should have said something. Are you mad at me? You shouldn't have done that, you went too far. Forgive me. - It is not funny. - No, it is not. We must not say anything. It is... Are you feeling well? You are white as snow. It's the motorcycle. I thought... I do not know. I got scared. I have very good Yunnan tea at home. It will do you good. Sit up. - You are not a believer? - No. However, there is something about you. I noticed it immediately. An aura. A kind of halo that maybe only I can see. I can feel it in some people. It radiates around you. No, I'm not crazy. I'm just a poor priest. And I try to believe in miracles. I should believe in them because I'm alive ... I mean... It's a kind of miracle that I'm here. You probably know ... Everything that is revealed here remains secret. Maybe you need to confess. - I am going home now. - Where? I live with the twins. I also sleep with both of them. Why are you telling me that? I know it's not that Catholic. But it happened. Before I had no desire, but now I want to feel things. Is it wrong? Christ said, "Do not judge and you will not be judged." - He had a weakness for sinners. - Yes. What about you? What about me? Do you also have a weakness for sinners? Of course. But not for their sins. Hi. Are you still looking for someone? I can serve. I've done this before. - You can get something better. - I need work. I do not know who you are, where you are from, - or anything bad you may have done. - I haven't done anything. Then you are the only one. Maud? It's Claire. 371a 00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:51,603 SEVEN DAYS EARLIER You should try hypnotherapy. That is full of poison. I'll consider it. I've been waiting for 20 minutes. Sorry, I had some problems with my associate. We have to talk. We have to be honest with each other. Maybe now that my husband is gone, we do not have to hide. But we are still hiding. Do not interrupt me, please. This is what I want to say: It isn't as strong as it used to be. I get less pleasure. I... I get less ... joy with you. We must take a break before we destroy everything. No? Do you think so? What do you think? I agree. I have been hoping for several months that ... we would get the spark back. It happens to all couples. For a while, I thought we were the exception. That we were something special. We really had something amazing together. You're right. You are stronger and more realistic than me. I was afraid to face reality. So, I did you a favour. You are relieved. No. Yes. I... You're taking a weight off me. I... I do not want to lose you. We'll probably find out how... to be together, to be together in a different way. It will also be beautiful. Excuse me. Yes? I'm in a meeting, but tell me. I do not have their address. It's in the car. Fine. I'll check and email it to you later. Pardon me. I have to take care of this. So... Shall we still see each other on Sunday? It's still on, right? Yes, of course. Hello, it's Claire. Leave your message. Claire. I wasn't able to talk to you. I have wanted to tell you how I feel for weeks. I... I'm looking at you now. So pure. So beautiful. I love you. And if I could ... You seem more relaxed than last time. I'm not relaxed. I am devastated. You need to be liberated ... I can help you. I do not want to feel liberated. I want everything to go back to what it was. In that case, there is only one choice. She has to go. I can have it arranged. She has to go far away. No that is not enough. She has to go away ... definitively. Definitively? People here talk but do not act. I can do it. I know how. Stay there for ten minutes. Think about it. Half now. The rest next week. At the same time. Is this the only option? There is no other way. You know, after our little talk ... I was afraid of losing you. Really? Yes, really. Isn't it weird that Claire hasn't been to work these past few days? Is she involved in anything new? It's not like her. This is not the first time. - Really? Has it happened before? - Yes. Maybe she's sick. - I hope it's not because of me. - You? Why? I may have said something ... that she may have found upsetting. What was it? Nothing, something silly. I don't even remember. Forget it. She'll come back. Maud? It's Claire. - Bad news? - Wrong number. You got a weird expression in your face. Me? Claire? This is Clement. My son. At least I think so. He is a good son. He visits me every week. I have a motorcycle, so it's easy. But from far away. It's not that easy. No alcohol. Cote du Rhone is for me. He doesn't drink. Are you an athlete? He teaches karate, taekwondo and that Brazilian dance. - Capoeira. - Capoeira. Don't be shy. He does not like to talk about it, but he is a champion, he should be proud. - And he's nice. - Stop. - Isn't he handsome? - Pardon. - Would you like dessert? - No, never. Coffee, please. A small tip, you need to ask customers if they liked the food. Maybe they do not like it, but your boss would like to know. - Okay. - Is she good to you? Yes, she is kind. - I'm annoying. - No not at all. I can be a little tiring sometimes. - You just seem a little tense. - Do I? I dreamed about you last night. Was it a good dream or a nightmare? Well ... in the beginning it was good. But bad towards the end. If you have time off after your shift, there is a nightclub three miles from here. So... An you can tell me about your dream? See you later. No. I do not feel like it. Piss off. Come on. Shut up! Are you pushing me? No! You were right up against him. It was... disgusting. Are you insane? You did not even thank Clement. - He saved you from a beating. - Nothing like that, I can defend myself. He just did that to impress you. It looks like it worked. Why did you bring me here if you can not stand this kind of thing? You're right. It may be, but there is a reason. I was adopted. That is why I have always been weak. I first spoke when I was five. Like Einstein. Really? I'm not Einstein. No. You're more handsome. I should have been happy, more pleasant. Why is this so hurtful and difficult? We'll be there soon. Don't you mind being alone with those guys? In that house, so secluded? No. It does not bother me. Great. Forget that I asked. It's just a little unusual. Most people will think it's weird, right? Aren't we all a little weird? Do you know anyone who is not? I don't know. Maybe not. We are never what people think we are. This also applies to you. Do not take it badly, but I thought you would be ... stronger. I saw another side of you before. Fragile. Do you mean pathetic when you say fragile? No. I liked it. Can you repeat that? I like you. If I lose control ... it will be a disaster. Why a disaster? This is a disaster. Did I hurt you? We are not alone. You're a little crazy. No, not at all. You'll wake up the whole forest. - Good day. - Good day. Can I help? I am looking for a tour guide to the area. Are you on a pilgrimage? In a way, yes. You'll probably go to the sanctuary of La Salette. You have to see that if you haven't already. Unfortunately, that's the only one I have. I'm an atheist. But I have a friend who is a priest who says that miracles often happen here. Well, but these days ... I almost tend to believe him, because in just a few days ... I have experienced two miracles. Two? Yes. You... Your beauty is like a Renaissance Madonna. And... And a young woman came by. Very pure, mysterious. Another miracle is ... that she likes being here. Doesn't that happen often? Never. Sorry, I have nothing else. The sanctuary. Can you recommend a good hotel? Yes. The sanctuary has rooms. Hello, Father. Sorry you had to wait. How can I help? I didn't exactly come here for a retreat, but ... But I do seek peace and serenity. Like all of us. Actually... I'm looking for my stepdaughter. A very... fragile young woman. She ran away a few days ago ... I'm worried about her. I... I cannot sleep. - Follow me. - Thanks. Her father, my husband, passed away recently. It affected her deeply. And... I'm afraid I wasn't there for her. I was... drowning in my own pain. She's angry at me. I don't want to upset her by surprising her here. - I'm afraid she will run away again. - I understand your anxiety. - What is her name? - Claire. I know her. If I can be of use, and if you need someone to intercede to make peace with her, I am happy to help. It's a blessing to have met you, Father. - Thanks for last night. - Yes. - What happened last night? - Nothing. - Nothing at all. - Where are you going? To the toilet. Can I go to the toilet? Claire? - May I show you something? - Yes. It has nothing to do with music. But I think he is a wonderful writer. And an excellent illustrator. See his strokes ... so full of energy. Look at the figures. They look like elves ... or dwarves. Another one here. It's a gift for you. That's very kind. - Are you staying with us? - Yes. - You are not going out tonight? - No. Give it to me. What are you thinking about? That I'm happy here. I hope it lasts. I'm so tired of his music. Don't you like Bach? I don't like classical music. Let's wish he stops. Do you hear that, Chernobyl? Yes. I know. - Hi, Claire. - Hi. - It's pretty steep here. - Yes, a little. - When are you going back home again? - Probably on Sunday. Do you have a girlfriend there? Why? Sorry, I didn't mean to be indiscreet. No I don't. It's like you're avoiding me, so either you do not like me, - or you are generally like this ... - No, it's just ... I'm not like my father. I don't go after all women. He was very nice and polite to me. He's a disgusting old pig. - You know him better than I do. - Not necessarily. Claire? Claire. - Are you hurt? - No. - I confessed something to you. - The twins. I am just discovering and understanding things. It's all so new for me. And now? I slept with another man. You're not the only one here who has. I assure you. You can 't imagine what people are telling me. The mountains arouse desires in people. The mountains? Yes. It's the mountains. Will you come to me every time you meet someone? What do you want? That I give you my blessing? Do you know why you do this? Do I need any reason? I didn't know what desire was. Now I know. That's good for you. You don't need my help to have fun. Have fun? It's not fun. This is life. Is it wrong? Does this make me a devil's creature? The devil is more insidious than that. He hides behind masks. You, young lady, are as transparent and pure as fresh water. Transparent and pure? Why not? You feel alive. So live life. Live it to the fullest. As Saint Augustine said: "Love ... and do as you wish." There is someone here who is seeking reconciliation. Do not shut yourself off from her. To embrace the future. You need to make peace with your past. I'm taking you to her room. It is not necessary. She's here. You're surprised to see me. Thank you very much, father. You can leave us, may we be alone, please? Thanks. I was so worried something had happened. How did you find me? - We were interrupted when you called. - I found the number and looked it up. And... And now I'm here. Tell me what happened. Of course I believe you. I'm a little shaken. So you ran away. What happened to the woman? I have no idea. Without that accident, I wouldn't be here. Only a sick person would go that far. You never know what darkness is hiding in people. It does not worry me anymore. I've stopped thinking about it. You can not stay here forever. We all miss you. And I need you. I cannot go back to the city. Return to my past life. - I'm fine here. - Really? In this horrid place? It's not a horrid place. I've made a lot of friends. Have you? That's important. Just take it easy. No rush. Maybe I'll stay a few days. If that's ok with you, of course. Maybe you'll change your mind. I have to go to work. - I'll drive you. - Okay. SNOW WHITE It feels a bit strange. Maybe we have a flat tire. Can you check the left front wheel? There's nothing wrong with the wheel. Do you have a problem? We thought we had a flat tire. You are lucky to have such a beautiful stepdaughter. Fine, see you soon. There is a wine tasting in the village. Let's go. See you soon? - When are you free? - Sunday. - You can show me around. - That would be nice. Maybe a picnic? Good idea. May I tell you something? You're more alive now. - You think so? - Yes. It is as if what you have been through has made you more beautiful. How is your son? Fine. Actually, no... I wanted to tell you. He is always in his room. He gets more and more weird. Weird how? He is always angry with me. Especially when it comes to you. - Me? - Yes. He says he's ashamed of how I behave around you. What have I done wrong? Have I crossed any lines with you? No, never. I said that, but he would not listen. He is stubborn, aggressive. Can you talk to him? Yes, but what should I say? Ask him not to judge me. It hurts me a lot. I'm going there after work. Very well. What are you doing here? Are you all right? Yes. I'm fine. I was too forward this morning. Yes, you were. So were you. Yes. We were both a little forward. Yes. Friends again? Because I like you. You are very charming. You should just take it easy a little bit. Everything is good. - Really? - Yes, it's fine. That's great. Thanks. I always worry. Did you get time ... to look at the book I gave you? Yes, a little bit. Did you like it? It is unusual. But inspiring. Yes, inspiring. Don't you think they all look a bit like you? How? Their cruelty. I'm sure you can be cruel. Don't laugh. - Me? Certainly not. - Oh yes. I'm sure it's in your nature. You just have to unleash it. Charles, remember what you said. - What was it? You have always behaved well, didn't cross any lines. I need to be reprimanded. - Punish me severely. - No. Punish me. - No. - I deserve it. - No no no. - Hit me. - Let go now. - Beat me please. - Beat me with the strength of a Kalmyk. - A what? A strong Mongol warrior. - No. Stop. - Punish me. Hit me, hit me harder. Come on... Take the whip. Come on. Whip me. Beat me. Come on. I deserve it. Hit me, step on me. Keep going! Keep going! Yes! It's not much for you, but it means everything to me. - Only three small lashes. - I beg you! Beat harder, for God's sake! All right, all right, that's fine. There it is. Finally I found my Sokurov. Claire? - Where are you going? - To the twins. I am going there as well. Put the bike in the trunk. No need. Please come. Okay. This is for you. A gift. I do not want a mobile phone. Why not? - Everyone has one. - Not me. Did we have a wonderful evening together, or am I completely out of my mind? - Yes, that was wonderful. - Then why can't I call you? - There's no point in doing that. - Why not? It's very obvious to me how it ends. You will start calling. Then you will want to know everything... - I would just like to know if you would consider ... - Sam, I don't want to make any commitments. It is suffocating to make plans. Now I can breathe. Great. You can breathe. I am very happy for you. Meanwhile, I suffer. Because I'm not yours? No. Yes. I'm with you. Is that not enough? It's easy for you. No, it's not easy. It isn't easy to not belong to anyone. But that's what I want. How is your dog? Thank you for asking. He is well. Claire? Are you still coming up to my room today? Maximum 20 minutes. - Vincent will play Bach for me. - Yes. In his room? For 20 minutes? - Sam? - What? Oh, sorry. - Pardon. - No, just... It is Bach's first cello suite. OK fine. Great. Fine. See you later. Do you think that you are fooling me with your Bach suite? - Stop. - It is not fun. Be honest. Tell the truth. Your nonsense is honestly getting a little tiring. Are you okay? Shit! Are you hurt? I'm great. - Great? - Yes, great. Ok, It's really painful. Is it swollen? No not yet. We need ice. Or maybe frozen peas. I have to... put my instrument away. Your what? - My cello. - Yes. I have to put it away. It was sublime. TO BERNARD: IT'S OK. SHE IS ALIVE. - The water is cold. - Yes. Your skin is still so soft. Soft as silk. You have a nice backside. Do you know? Has anyone ever told you that? I don't think so. At your age, I was as thin as a toothpick. I had short hair. I looked like a boy, unlike you. Someone is looking at us. At least I think so. Are you sure? What is it? Nothing. Who is it? It's Clement. I know him. Were you spying on us? No, I wasn't spying on you. What are you doing then? I'm ... fishing for trout. Where's your fishing rod? I'm in the planning phase. Since you're here, join us. Come on. Is it ok? - Are you hungry? - Yes. - Here you go. - No, that's not okay. I am not going to eat with a man who was spying on us. He is not like that, he wasn't spying on us. Do you believe him? It's alright, it doesn't matter. I'd better go. No, wait, Clement. He is my friend. We can share, right? Thanks, Claire, that's sweet, but I do not want to bother you. I'm sorry. You will not believe it, but I have never seen her happier. - She's glowing. - Really? - She's unrecognizable. - What do you mean? She's having a hot affair with a young man. They fuck out in the woods. And not just with him. She lives on a deserted farm with three men, so imagine what happens there. Are you sure about all this? That's not how she is. Girls today like strong emotions. They are heartless. We're not like them, are we, honey? You have nothing to say? No. It's just hard to believe. She can't have changed that much. It may be true. We don't even know those closest to us, before they reveal their true nature right in our faces. You're very quiet. It's your fault. You made me enjoy silence again. No need to talk. Just... feel. Excuse me. It's my turn now. Here we go, thanks. Don't worry. I just saved his life. He was about to collapse. - You are so impudent. - Go back to him if you want. Go! I feel like killing them when I see them dancing with you. Kill them! But forget it. It's alright. I... Dance with me! I'm really great here, so ... I don't want to risk losing everything just for a dance. For once in your life, take a risk! It will do you good! You did not say you were Claire's stepmother. Do not say a word. I like your silence. It's mysterious. I can see you're a fierce, ruthless woman. Am I wrong? Two glasses of red wine, please. Thanks. Pardon! Sorry, ma'am. - You again? - I'm sorry. - Did you do it on purpose? - No. I know she does not like me and I do not like her. Listen up. She has a warm smile but cold eyes. I do not trust her. No, I don't drink alcohol. Ok, just a little. Again! We haven't danced together. All these men... It is very strong. Don't worry about it. It's a party. - Are you ok? - What's up with her? - I'm dizzy. - No no. - I'm dizzy. - It's ok. I'll take you home. - Come. - I am not feeling well. No worries, you'll be fine. It will be ok. Are you feeling better? I feel nauseous. Slow down. I don't feel well. You were a princess. You have now become the queen. The queen of hearts. It must be so exciting. I only had one love and you took him from me. You stole him.
