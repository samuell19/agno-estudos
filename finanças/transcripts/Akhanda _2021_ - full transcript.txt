Sir. Ghanjendra spotted, sir. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Gajendra Sahu. He is not an ordinary target. He is the most wanted criminal of this terrain. Forests and the water bodies are being ruined by him. Industries are vanishing. Hundreds of police officers, military men and thousands of civilians died in an effort to nab him. He is a high value target. If he smells your presence there, none of you would be alive. You will all die. That great soul isn't somewhere far. He is right here in the green tree that's growing in front of you. That is his form. He exists in the flowing river. The mantra that he gives us is the sound of that flowing river. He exists in the pure, fresh air that you breathe. That is how he gives us life. If we destroy any of these three things, would the human kind be able to survive? Will the next generation be able to take birth? Protecting them is the gift that you give me. The nature is the form that the five elements take. It is the truest form of the almighty. This is the truth. Believe this and shape your living accordingly. May everything in the entire world prosper. Ghajendra. You've been wanting to ask me something for some time now. Go ahead and ask me. Why are you gathering so many people? Many practitioners of yogic lifestyle, accomplished people and extraordinary men, walked the path of Dharma and established this place of worship. Their respect is not for this body. They respect that place of worship. I want that place of worship. What will you do after you have it? I am going to use the five elements that you spoke about. I will ruin the country that killed me. You must never challenge the fate, the one who writes our fate, and the entire world. The response they give you is something you will not be able to handle. Response? Tell it to come. No matter when it comes to me, or in what form or even if it comes in front of me with a lot of strength, I will take it on. According to the will of the god. Young man, you've been blessed with twins. But... one of them is alive and the is no movement in the other one. Holy man, you never set foot in another man's threshold and yet, you came to our house. According to the will of the God. Ramachandraiah, this one is nature. That one is a natural disaster. Cultivate your relationship with this one. Cut the cords of this one from you. Time is the answer for some things. Break those bonds. Holy man, as a father, I cannot do anything. If the mother knows, she is going to die. May I have your kind attention, please. The train number 517, heading to Varanasi through Ananthpur is ready to start. Lord. Om, lord who resides in Kashi, The lord of the entire world. Lord, when this Bairaghi didn't have anyone to call his own, you gave me this child. This child hasn't opened his eyes yet. I don't know about his birth, the path he is going to take, the destination he is going to reach. You asked me to bring him to you. And I did. I offer him to you Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! Supreme being of disaster. You helped his birth and tied the bonds to disaster and danger. And now, he is your responsibility. Son. - Father. When you let go of working for Rajappa by laying down the knife, and worked alongside with me, look at the change you've made, son. Look at how abundantly the crop has grown. Yes, father. Dear god, I pray that you always shower your benevolence on us. Break the coconut. Let's start the harvest. What's going on? I was the one who held him back, sir. - Why? That great man gave us farmland when we didn't have any. He also gave us seedlings and helped us support ourselves. We promised him that we wouldn't get into fights and feed ourselves with food obtained by spilling blood. Just because he gave you seedlings, you obeyed him? What if you don't have those seedlings? You will be back to being dogs in front of my house, isn't it so? Cut everything. Sir! Sir! Please, don't do it. Sir, the crop is ready to be harvested. Please don't ruin it, sir. I beg you. Please, don't. Oh no! They are ruining Narsappa's crop. Oh dear! Oh, dear! Great one! Oh Lord! Basava. Kannapa. Even though your blood is boiling, You restrained your anger because of the promise you made me. That's enough. You'll grow in life. I promise you. I'll take on the responsibility of getting your sister married. Hey, You seem to be promising things without knowing what we are capable of. Should I have measured your capability like you were some Polavaram dam or Patti Seema project? You are a small little creek. If you mess with us, we are going to sever your head off. Get that? If you mess with us, we are not the ones to use violence and fight back. We will be the ones to mess with you first and then thrash you. We are not the kind to turn around and fight those chasing us. We are the kind to chase and beat you up. We just cut the head off of our opponents before we leave from there. What's this route, brother? - This is a shortcut. Oh dear! Looks like it's a factional fight. I need to get away from here immediately. They're killing each other. Factional fight? They're killing each other? What are you looking at? Axe him! What's up? Are you going to axe me? Go ahead and use your axe on me. What's with this thrashing? I asked that young man to come and work for me. What's wrong with what I said? When you are speaking to another person, learn how to conduct the conversation respectfully. There is a difference between asking, “How is your father?” And “How is your mother's husband doing?” You bastard! Rajappa. I already told you way back to stop with these factional fights. The children have changed. But you didn't change. That is why I needed to strongly warn you. It's easy to win over your enemies. But it's difficult to win people over. Try it. I didn't hit you to remind you of what pain feels like. I wanted you to know what you've done wrong. A tree is like a vermillion dot on the forehead of the earth. If you cut it down, there will be neither shelter nor food or even existence of mankind. Try and grow a tree with the very hands that you used to cut them down. You would understand the value of a tree and even the soil. You are the foundations of this society. Don't become its cemetery. What work do you have here, lady? I need to meet with your sir, -Sir? Sir, the situation is critical, sir. Bury her. Clean the room and keep it. When I went to the station, they told me that he is at the guesthouse and asked me to come here. Wow! What's the matter? My sister's husband came home drunk and beat up my sister, sir. Why is that? Apparently, my sister isn't enough for him. He wants me as well. He keeps touching me here and there, sir. He kept touching you? You? - Yes. Damn it! He has to be fated to get married to someone like you. Oh dear! How fair-skinned you are! What a beauty. Do you know something? If I wasn't married, I would have married you with my eyes closed. Well, sir... My brother-in-law isn't as nice a person as you are. I wonder why the goats always vote for the butcher. On the way. Put the phone down. I am going to meet with the District Administrative Officer for a small bit of work. When I return, we will settle things between us and then, deal with your brother-in-law. You freshen up and I'll be back after taking care of some work. Alright, sir. Good morning, ma'am. Ms. Padmavati...? - Principal Secretary. I was recently posted in Environment and Forest department. Please come. I was trained under your mentorship. I am happy to have the opportunity of working with you now. It's your first posting and this is a tough district. This is a tough terrain and these are tough people too. Be little careful. Sir, the District Administrative Officer is asking for you. Since this is my joining day, let's just sign and then go to your guesthouse. I am not that kind of a man, madam. Oh, really? Then, what is this? Don't believe her, madam. She is a whore. She came to you for help because the guy she fell in love cheated her. And you... you raped her! Madam... When she's close to losing her life, you order her to be buried? You ruthless bugger! You are suspended. - Madam, you don't know about me. Shut up! SP, arrest him. The evidence is right here. Okay, madam. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go, sir. There's no need, lady. Sit down. I am there for you. Don't be scared. Good job. Thank you, ma'am. Who is the "Uravakonda" town concerned CI? Mr. Chief Inspector? Madam is asking for you. Yes, madam. - Your mobile number. 98664♪♪♪♪ I've sent you a photo. By the time I finish my meeting with the minister, You need to arrest that man and produce him before me. We'll meet again, ma'am. Hello, boys and girls. You all know who we've been waiting for today. We request the central minister, Mr. Bharat Reddy and the District Administrative Officer, Ms. Sharanya Bachupally, who is taking charge today, to come onto the stage. He won the MP election from our region, Welcome, ma'am. Thank you. And took on the responsibilities of a Central Minister, Mr. Bharat Reddy. We request him to address the gathering. This generation knows me as the MP of this region. But the previous generations knows me very well. Once upon a time, my family was prominent in the factionalism of this region. I am the only heir. I would use my knife to get my way. But there was a man who challenged me by telling me that if I keep killing everyone in my way, instead of a society, I would be left with only graves. He advised me that my strengths are not to be used here. He removed the gun that was in my hand, placed a pen instead and helped me win the MP elections. He made me rise to the position of a central minister and put me in front you. In this region, he replaced the hands that held a sickle with a plough He placed books in the hands of their children so that they wouldn't need to hold weapons. You are all the result of such efforts. But who did all this? One farmer. He is the reformer of this region. Here comes the roaring lion. Namaste, officer. You asked me to meet with you. I'll finish up with this meeting and meet with you after that. Sorry, I was delayed because of a small meeting. In any region, the person who owns a lot of property is not the most respected man. The most-respected man is the one who has good thoughts. We've elected him as the MP of our region. But it was his effort that raised him to the ranks of a central minister. You must have that sort of a determination. Hats off to him! If someone does something wrong, the fingers are pointed at the parents. If someone does something good, everyone is curious as to where he hails from. That's because, right from our birth to our death, we might have changed into hundreds of clothes. But the only thing that we cannot change about ourselves is where we were born. That is our hometown. It is your responsibility to protect it. It is our responsibility. I will give you a small example. The birth place of struggle is Telangana. In a small village in Mahabubnagar, a girl child was born into a farming family that couldn't even have one proper meal a day. The village she was born into did not have proper bus connectivity either. Every day, she would ride a bike to a school that was ten kilometers away. She would study hard and clear the Civil Services Examination, and is right now in front of us as the administrative officer of our district. She is the you should aspire to be. Give her a loud applause. Hats off to you, madam. Establishing institutions for your education is not that note-worthy a feat. You using these facilities to make the establishment proud is a real achievement. It's not note-worthy when you finish your education here and take with you a degree that helps only you. What's note-worthy is when you take with you the philosophies that are beneficial to the world and society. Who is going to stop the cruelty and abuse that woman are subjected to in the society? You must be the ones to stop it. Your philosophies and your way of life should be the one that stops such acts. Who is going to stop those people who divide and create chaos in the name of caste, religion and region? You should be the ones to stop them. Your way of life and philosophy of life should stop it. All of you have a responsibility for it. Pure minds create clean society and great future. Thank you. Sir, we've quit the path of violence. We are going to follow you until our death. If you called for him, he would have come to the office himself. You coming all the way here... We misunderstood him. We can't call him here just to apologize. So, let's go. Brother, the girl has come. Why are you standing here, dear? Come in. Come inside, dear. Place your right feet first when you come in. These people take their customs seriously, madam. Come, dear. How are your parents, dear? - They are well, sir. I am Ramachandraiah. She is my wife, Dharani. Sit down, dear. Everyone come here. She is here. Hi. Sit down, dear. How is the girl? - She is fair-skinned. Mr. Satyamurthy. - Sorry, Ramachandraiah. Girls of this generation are very spoiled. They have gone to a stage where they demand that their husbands take them to pubs and clubs after the sun goes down. My daughter isn't the right fit for your family. That is why I didn't send her. You didn't send her? I am the District Administration Officer. Forgive us, dear. His friend's daughter came down from US. His friend said that he would send his daughter and asked us to introduce her to Murali Krishna. And if they like each other, he wanted to get them married. I thought you were her. Well, why did you come by, dear? I came to meet Mr. Murali Krishna. Really? He is right here with farmers. Come, dear. Come. Manager. - Sir. On behalf of all the farmers... I was the one who put down the signature for collateral. Yes, sir. Give them whatever amount they ask as loans. I am there for them. You are our Lord, sir. I am one of you. I am a part of your family. Don't praise me and distance yourself from me. Let's go and have our meal together. I shall call him, dear. - Sir... Sir... He must be busy. I'll meet him later. These documents need your signature. Yesterday, I went to Mr. Murali Krishna's house. Thank you. Very interesting character. Not just him. After meeting his family, I felt their house to be the cradle of good customs and traditions. What's strange is that... There are a lot more people flocking around his house than the District Administrative Office. Great. You've made a lot of observations in a single visit. Madam, Mr. Murali Krishna is here to meet you. Mr. Murali Krishna? Wait for two minutes and send him in. - Okay, madam. Namaste, madam. Mr. Murali Krishna, when did you come? Just two minutes ago. You are too important to be kept waiting. You can come in directly. Hello, ma'am. How are you? I am well, sir. - Sit here What brings you by? - I am sorry. I heard that you came to my home yesterday. A few farmers from neighboring villages dropped in at the same time. I was occupied and couldn't meet you. It's not a problem. But I met with your family. I enjoyed a lot. What else, sir? Tomorrow, there is a Pulse Polio immunization program at our hospital. If you could spend an hour, it would be good. I think I am free. - Thank you, ma'am. It's at 9 o'clock in the morning. Isn't the government responsible for conducting the Pulse Polio immunization program? Why would he do that? Not just schools and colleges. He is the one who built all the hospitals around the area. Not just that. These hospitals are with best facilities and best doctors and are free of cost. Alright. You said you wanted some signatures? Mine lease extension file. Copper mine in Nallamala forest. Isn't this a green zone? Why would there be mining in it? Exactly my thoughts. By the time I came here, all the permissions were granted and the Mine began to operate. I think something is going wrong. Ms. Padmavati, I want a complete report on the activities of the Mine. And, keep it between you and me only. By the way, the DSP is working for the Mine owner. What's the name of that Mine owner? Varadha Rajulu. Varadha mines. What is it? What's going on? He vomited blood and passed out. - He vomited blood? Brother... Brother, get up. Hey, stop the work? Why did you stop the work? For years, we've been working with the mud and stone to make a livelihood. No matter where we worked, nothing happened to us. Here, as we go deeper, the workers are vomiting blood, itching and have burning sensation in the eyes. Father, why get into trouble? Hold on. Until we know what's happening here and what we are up to here, we wouldn't step into the mine. Let's go Mother? - Yes. Who are you? - Our car had some trouble while passing through the forest. I am hungry. We don't have rice at home, sir. We have millet balls. Would you like to have them? I am okay with anything. Young one, get the banana leaf. - Come in, sir. Did you eat, lady? My husband went to the city. I'll cook for him when he returns. You go ahead, sir. Wash your hands, sir. Why bother going out in the rain? I don't like to owe someone who fed me. That's not necessary, sir. I will give you what I owe. What happened? Oh goodness! Why do you care what happens in the Mine, you fool?! From now on, whoever complains about being muddy or itchy or bleeding and makes up such excuses to stop the work, I will call them to my house and feed the entire hamlet a... funeral feast. Hi, sir. - Please come. The children seem to follow discipline. Thank you so much. Love you all. Touched my heart. Hello, please. Take good care of the child, lady. Doctor, please take good care of the children. - Yes, sir. Happy birthday, officer. - Thank you, sir. You made my day. Are you just going to give me flowers? Is there no party? Well, we'll have lunch at my place today. I asked for a party, instead, you invite me for a traditional feast. What do you want, ma'am? Listen, I am not an administrative officer. I am just Sharanya and you are just Murali Krishna. Today, you must not deny any of my requests. Murali Krishna, don't fret. In Telangana, we usually call family and those dear to us without the honorifics. Our language might seem a little rough but we are soft-natured. You're okay with it, right? By the way, are you interested in me? - What? Well, you've made me happy with the way you introduced me on the stage. Happy. And you've celebrated my birthday, so I'm even more happy. Looks like you are very focused on me. What's the story? The way you tie your saree shows your Teluguness. The way you walk is proud. Your words are straight-forward. I like them. Please put on the seat belt. Life is very precious. Sorry.. Here. Here. Stop. What is it? - Party. Here? Hurry up. Get on. What? Get on? Perhaps it's not appropriate. We've come so far. Do you think people would still recognize you? Get on. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir, you are here... She... Even though I've got you this far, you still seem popular. Of course not! We are his fans, we will never stop adoring him. Sir, please let me message my young friends that you are here. They have come with a lot of fun and fare. They have come together, our brother and his lady. Brother and sister-in-law @ tatitopulu. How is it, sister-in-law? - I will kill you. Get on. Get down. Sir. He's rocked it plenty. Get me down. I thought our brother was aggressive. She seems even more aggressive. Is it appropriate to consume alcohol now? - This is not alcohol. This is medicine. This is our tradition. If you consume it, your body is going to be cleansed and your mind will cool down. Didn't you do this in your childhood? As a child, when he was supposed to play with video games, he got into fights and thrashed people. Here, take it. Hold it. Sit down. - Sit down? Where? Just sit down. Hold this. You there, give me the toddy. Do you have some pickle? - What do you mean pickle? I meant mango pickle. Oh? You want pickled mango. We have it. Here it is, lady. Super! Here, lick it. Not like that. Take it like this. Smear it like that and do this. Open your mouth. Wow! How well you lick, sir. Keep licking. Keep licking. She is doing a good job of making you lick. Only when you lick and swallow properly, the discomfort in your throat will settle down. Drinking toddy is an art. I will show it to you. Watch and learn. Get up. Give me that box. Pour it.

But the radiation is very high and very dangerous, sir. You are going to be the pioneer in the market. No one can dethrone you. Brother, someone'e come with a deal. Jagajith Chauhan. I have businesses all over India and they are best businesses too. I have my contacts in every Government. Right from the top to the bottom of the chain. Well, if I've come this far, it means that you have the best Mine in the country. I want that Mine. If you've been operating this Mine all these years without the government finding out about it... I mean... I can gauge your guts. If you sell it to me, you will be very happy. If not, you are going to be in the headlines. National headlines. What is this? - Answer. My hair. You told me what you are. I am going to show you what I am. Who do you think is behind him? A person who is hungry needs food. A person who believes in God, chases good karma. That is the philosophy of this Ashram. This is the path that my teacher has shown me. May you endeavors be successful. If you tear up, I will wipe your tears. If you are in difficulties, I will be the one taking care of you. If you are in pain, I will be the one who will take on your suffering. I am here. I am here for you. I am with you. I am in all of you. The sins committed at Brahma's are destroyed at Vishnu's. The sins committed at Vishnu's are destroyed at Shiva's place. The sins committed at Shiva's are destroyed at your teachers. The sins committed at your teachers are destroyed when everything turns into nothing. May it be so! Namaste, Mr. Rai. Namaste, Holy Man. Namaste. What is the reason for your anger? - Your worshiper has been insulted. When you went and asked for a mine, he pulled out his hair and placed it in your hand. Is that it? - Yes, holy man. He threw his hair on my face. - Is it him? You are a God, holy man. It's him! It's him! I want his Mine and I want him dead. He must die. How dare you go against Varada? I am the spirit. He is my body. That Mine is ours. Good bye. How are the Mine operations proceeding? The contamination tanks are full. Take the bore out and send it all back into the earth. Bore? Reverse boring system. - Isn't it dangerous, holy man? Ten years ago, we did the same thing in Bengal. People died. But did that affect us? We did that in Bihar and Assam. We are going to be doing this here as well. If you don't understand what happened, half of the people will die. If they understand what's going on and start questioning, all of them will die. Varada Rajulu. Once upon a time, this country gave me something. I am going to return its charity a hundred-fold. With your support. If two people get together, their wealth might be the reason. Their customs and traditions might bring them closer. But when their aspirations match, it is indeed very rare. But I could see that light in our journey. Let's walk together.

I would like your blessings. Take it. Oh, lord the destroyer. What is the meaning of this? Go! Go! Go, fast! Go and bring all of them to ward 3. Come on. Make it fast. Hurry up. Sir, you need to start immediately and get to the hospital. Sir, please. You must come here urgently. Start the fluids. Come. Get him on to this bed. Look at him, sir. - Hold on, lady. Hold on Until yesterday, these children were laughing and playing around. Please save him, sir. Sir! I wonder which mountain goddess was angered. I don't know what evil wind touched them. Look at them, sir. Take a look, sir. How can a just born be in such a state? What happened, doctor? - I don't understand, sir. What? I can't figure out if this is a virus or poison or some chemical effect. Each of these patients don't have just one organ damage. They have multiple organ damages. They are not responding to any medication. They are little kids, sir. They are unable to take it. What the hell is happening?! Where are you now? I am just heading to the Bangalore airport. Please start immediately and come to the hospital. Turn the vehicle around. All these people belong to the Nallamala Boga mountain region. What happened there? That is a deep tribal area, sir. Viral diseases such as these are pretty common there, sir. This isn't a viral attack, sir. These people don't practice good hygiene or cleanliness, sir. It's no wonder they've caught diseases. Unclean people? Murali... Murali... Calm down. Please. There is a small copper mine in that area. Do you think they would be affected by such an insignificant thing? That is not a copper mine, sir. It is just a copper mine in name. But Uranium is being extracted from there. What?! Uranium? My Lord! Don't make unfounded allegations, Ms. Padmavati. It's a complicated matter. Shut up. Complicated? For whom? For you or for Mr. Varadha Rajuju? This is the report compiled after procuring data for three years. When the district administrative officer talked about this, I've started my investigation. I took a lot of risk and used sensors and fiber optic probes, and collected samples from the mines. I knew that they would be compromised here. So, I got it tested in a laboratory in Hyderabad. Do you know what they found out, sir? Copper exists only up to the depth of fifty feet. Below that, all of it is Uranium, sir. They extract it there, purify it there and dug holes into the ground and used reverse boring to send it back into the earth, sir. This horror is a result of such activities. These are just early effects, sir. If this continues, very soon, this region is going to be the biggest graveyard in the country, sir. Mark my words. Doctor, make sure that every medicine and equipment required to save their lives is here within a matter of minutes. Where is that mine? This is my empire. I am going to turn it into ruins. I am war. - I am your death. I am destruction. - I am catastrophe. You can't touch me. - You cannot handle me. I am an animal. - I am the lion that hunts that animal. Come at me! Mr. Murali... Mr. Murali, please. Mr. Murali, please. Please hold on. You meddled with the soil. You meddled with the animals that provide us with milk. You meddled with the life-giving waters. And finally, you have messed with my people. Why would I let you go, you ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪?! Respect. Respect? Respect comes from behavior; not by begging. This is Anthapuram Varada Rajulu here. If you were born in a castle, I was born in Anantapuram. Whether it's wrong or right, if someone interferes with the decision I've made, I am going to beat them to pulp. Anyone who opposes me is going to be irritated And those who challenge me will have their funeral feast served on palm leaves. Head - Your Head? Once I've made a decision and stepped into the fray, I am like a bulldozer without brakes. I am going to squeeze you dead. Whether left or right, top or bottom, no matter from which direction you attack, not an inch of your body will ever be found again. Come at me! - Come at me! Mr. Murali... Mr. Murali, please. Where would he and this mine go? We will shut it down in an hour. The situation at the hospital is taking a downturn. Please. If even a single life is lost there, you will no longer be alive. Listen to me. There is a minister right beside him. That Administrative officer got all the proofs ready. This isn't that time, brother. This isn't the path to take. Please listen to me. Sir, he is someone who does simple quarry mining. For someone like him to use such a high-end equipment would mean that there is a bigger force at play here, sir. Please give me some time, sir. I'll bring all the information to light. You must. If not, a lot of future generations will be lost. You are here, sir. As long as you are here, what is going to happen to us, sir. Nothing is going to happen, lady. I will make sure not a single life is lost And also make sure that that Mine doesn't operate anymore. Uncle, what happened? The little girl lost her consciousness and fell down while she was playing. She hasn't opened her eyes until now. Doctor! Bharat. You are here for us, sir. What's going to happen to us when you are around, sir. Not a single person was left alive, sir. Not a single one. Varada... Did the blood flow like flood? The dead bodies and morsels of meat scattered? There was a loss in sense of direction with the drums of death beating hard, isn't it? Holy one, how do you know about it? Do you think the one who created it wouldn't know about it? What about him? We need someone to pin this sin on. Leave him to me. Krishnamacharya Perumal. NIA, New Delhi. The one who died was a central minister. The bomb blast occurred at your hospital. You are under arrest. On what charges? You, being the wife of an accused, have no rights to question. And you are also under suspension. To find out the truth, you need to come with me. Shall we go? You are going to arrest him?! Let's see you do it. There are already a lot of lives lost. Do we need one more? Until yesterday, whatever happened in the Mine was a secret. Now, it's out in the open. All those who let the secret out and those who've supported it, and the villages that stand as evidence should no longer exist. Before the people recover from their sadness and look towards us, end them all. Highly advanced plastic explosives. And found in a small rural area. This is the first time in the state. I'm surprised. The minister came because you phoned him. As per phone records. He came to your hospital. Technically evidential. Until then you were right there. But, at the time of the blast, you moved to a safe zone. How come? Mr. Murali. I need to know why you killed the minister and so many innocent people as well. Silence will not change the truth. If you don't say anything, all your channels and options will be closed forever. No one can save you. Madam, the condition is serious. The child has been in an unconscious state for a long time. If she doesn't regain her consciousness, it is going to be dangerous. We have to immediately shift her to Bangalore. How can we go, doctor? Look at how the police have surrounded the entire house. Mr. Ramachandraiah. If Murali was here, he would risk his life to ensure that the child's life is saved. And we can't do the same for his kid? Let's go. Let's see who is going to stop us. No matter what happens, don't get down from the vehicle, dear. Come at me! The mistress is in the car. Save her. Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Don't be scared, lady. Nothing is going to happen to you. I'll take care of it. Hold the steering wheel, lady. Hold the steering wheel, lady. Madam, the child... Child? Child? Madam! Janani... Janani... Sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry... I am sorry. She must be here somewhere. Search her out! My child! Lord! Where else can she go? Kill her and her daughter. May you live long! Who the hell are you? The one with sun, moon and fire in his eyes. The rider of the white bull, Nandi. The one who wears a snake around his neck. The savior who protects by destroying the Tripura demon. I am Lord Shiva! Who are you? This body is eternal and abundant. My form is never ending and imperishable. I am Shiva. I am the destroyer! The sound of the conch that I heard isn't an ordinary one. The power that shook me up and my throne is no ordinary thing. The one that I saw is no ordinary being. Who is it? You must never challenge your fate, the creator and the entire world. The response they give you is something you cannot handle. Tatva... The throne has been contaminated. Shift the base to Ananthapuram immediately. Who is he? He is alive. Who did all this? Who is he? What happened? You want to know what happened? The divine dance has taken place here! The divine dance of lord shiva, sirs. He wouldn't wake up with your pleas. The hand that thrashed him was no man's. It's Lord Shiva's. He didn't send you dead bodies. He sent you a sign that he has come! He was on his mission to bring back old dying temples to life. And you pulled his attention towards you. If you play with the life of a child, will the divine one keep quiet? That is why. The third eye has been opened. You are done for. The holy man has returned to Ananthapur and is now staying at the ashram there. You go ahead. I'll follow you there with his head. I am saying this as your younger brother. Believe me, brother. Go on. You are the kind who braved anything and defeated everything that came in your way. But there's an unknown force that tripped you. I came here to find out what that is. And I'll leave only after figuring it out. Until then, keep the fire in your heart burning. I will tell you who you should burn in that fire. The devotees are waiting. Go ahead and take care of your brother. Who the hell are you? Om Namah Shivaya. Om Namah Shivaya. May you have a long-life span. Home land felt happy when you walked over Hands are saluting with the touch of the breeze Fire came opposite as a strength to bless you Water hailing Lord Siva cleansed the feet The sky thundered heavily conveying good wishes With all the five elements mesmerised Is bound to the hands of the baby and moved The holy man moved ahead today He is Lord Shiva who doesn't know sleep. Hail to Lord Siva, come on hey brave human Chant the holy words, my Lord Hey holy man, come on Come on, stop the fun now Hey Lord, come on warrior Hey lord of destruction, come fast Hey Lord, arrive faster Come my Lord, show us your mercy You said that you were going to the hospital. How come you came back immediately? What happened, dear? What are these injuries? What happened, dear? Baba. Forty people died... because of you. We need to investigate. Let's go to the station. Your husband killed hundreds of people using bombs just to cover up the crime that he committed. And someone else killed 40 of my people, all because they attacked you. Even though you are married, you've kept yourself in good shape. What the hell are you talking?! Let me say what I want to say. If you come in between, I am going to stomp on you. You old... fox Sir! This is wrong, sir. They are a very reputable family in this area. She is an ex-collector. Why are you physically assaulting them? Your behavior is not correct, sir. It's wrong? Then, what's right? What is the correct way, baby? Do you want me to sit them down and worship them? You want me to serve them biryani and stuff them up? How will we know the truth? How can we find out the truth? Sir, Bhairagi said that if you abuse a child, the supreme god will not stay quiet. Oh? Well, forget about physically abusing. Let's just kill her. Om Namah Shivaya. Is it this fellow? Is it him? Yes, it's me. It's me. The one who saved them... - It's me. The one Bhairagi was talking about... - It's me. The one who killed those forty people... - It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. Kill him! I don't know if one can meet God after performing a severe penance. But, when a child's life is in danger, when innocent people are subject to a lot of atrocities, Lord will definitely come there. Holy man. All the sins that you've listed out have happened right here. Sit down! Sit down! All this happened right in front of my eyes. Where did God make his appearance, holy one? How will he come? As long as you resist, God will never appear in front of you. When you let go of your ego, strength and pride, and succumb to the mightiness of the God, and understand that you are nothing and admit that you are defeated and scream until your throat turns raw, that God is your only recuse... That is when... That is when God will appear to you. God! (Screaming) Save me Holy man! As a God, I command you. Let him go! If you say a word, it becomes a sound. But if I say a word, it becomes a command. A divine command! Holy man, you are right. God is here. May the entire population of the world prosper. Other than him. Hey, - Lord Shiva! Hail the Supreme One. The doer of good! You are a pig that changed its colors in front of a raging bull. If you speak nonsense, your skull will be broken! Hail the destroyer! Hail the destroyer! Holy man, there is someone who is worse than him called Varada Rajulu. When his name burns, His life will burn too. He is your son, lady. That day, it was decided by Lord Shiva that I must separate your child from you. Now, he returns to you at the behest of your grandchild. This is Lord Shiva's will. What? You separate a child from his mother because God ordered you to? When you know everything, is separating me from my child justified? It's your child. But his birth has a purpose, lady. It is Lord Shiva who dictates the egg, embryo and embryonic body He ordered that this being be born from your womb. And as soon as he was born, Lord Shiva severed your relationships, and called him towards him. What is the reason? There is a brute who killed a great man of a holy throne and challenged the divinity, and committed the first wrongdoing that should never have been committed. He's played a dangerous game with the nature and committed the second horrible wrong. He killed innocent children and committed an unforgivable third wrong. That is why Lord Shiva blew the divine conch and began the war. Fine, no matter the reason for his birth, I am the mother who gave him birth. I want my son. That's my right. I will get his decision. Baba (Holy man) I am your mother. Until this very moment, I did not know of your existence and the fact that you were born to me. Lord Shiva asked for you and you were given away. How unjust! When a mother knows that her child is in front of her, how can she stop herself? Turn around. Life your head and take a look at your mother. You are my blood. You are my child. [reciting in Sanskrit] In this lifetime, Lord Shiva is my father. That divine mother is my only mother. This breath, this voice and this body... My destination and journey... are according to will of the Supreme being and his wife. This life is dedicated to Lord Shiva. My next life will be decided upon by the command of Lord Shiva. Hail to Lord Siva, resident of Kasi city Hail to Lord Siva, the power of destruction Hail to Aghora with great dancing posture and strength Hey holy naked man blessed by Lord Siva Lord Siva, your birth is without a mother Lord Siva, your birth is without a mother How do we tell you about the pain of a mother? How do we tell you about the pain of a mother? At the time of cutting the bonding intestine from the womb You took away and sent again like you You took away and sent again like you Hail to Lord Siva, resident of Kasi city Hail to Lord Siva, the power of destruction Hail to Aghora with great dancing posture and strength Hey holy naked man blessed by Lord Siva Lord in the form of Nataraja and decorated with snake in the neck The ferocious Lord with the Pinakapani bow The lord with eye on the fore head, living in the graveyard Hey Lord Siva holding poison in throat, we beg your rescue You have given us a blessing for our worships How can you finish him in front of our eyes? One is gone away for the righteous path Another changed his path chanting for God Without anyone to call as a mother, How can I lead this life without death, my Lord? Hail to Lord Siva, come on hey brave human Chant the holy words, my Lord Hey holy man, come on Come on, stop the fun now Hey Lord, come on warrior Hey lord of destruction, come fast Hey Lord, arrive faster Come my Lord, show us your mercy [mumbling mantras] Holy one, I would only get to hear your words. Now, I see that you've come here. What is the matter? [reciting mantras] Akhanda! Do you know him? He is Akhanda Rudhra Sikander Ghora. Holy one, he is the one who ruthlessly killed my teacher and our group of followers. He isn't an ordinary man. He's kept the seven chakras of the body in great control A great transcendental being. Even the five elements of nature obey his will. They are scared to touch him. These elements bow their head down to him. Even the cold that can harden the blood, Or the fire that melts the blood can never touch such beings. Time is their slave. All the mantras are merely their directions. For the sake of the blessing that says “May all the beings in the world prosper”, they would go anywhere, do great penance for it, and if need be, they would even fight a war. Prachanda, you know why I've come to you and you tell me this? I want to kill him. What are you scared of in this world? - Death. Death fears that man. When I call only ghosts answer my call. When he calls, the lord who is the source of all five elements, answers his call. But why did we cross paths? He was born for you. He took up weapon for you. And he set foot here in this world for you. This is the game Lord Shiva played while taking the shape of a small child. I am indebted to you. I will leave only after I solve your crisis. Believe me. Yeah, you've called it and my hand accidentally hit it. Damn it! Anyone can play the game, it's no big deal. Fine. Anyways, open your wallets. Come on, open it. Get the money out. Money out. Get the money out first It's wrong to pick these and gamble with them. We are not the ones in the wrong, priest. It's god's fault. He didn't give us work. How does it matter where we are? God doesn't give you a job. You will have to search for work yourselves. When we have to search for it ourselves, what's the use of having God around? That's true. Do we need a land that isn't fertile or a God that doesn't fulfill our needs? It's useless. No use. It's a waste. All of you will be punished. - Punished? Who is going to do that? Bhairagi. We are missing one person to play with us. Come and join us for a game. I don't know this game. - Then, what do you know? I know tiger hunt. - What does that mean? The tiger and the goat game. - In this game, who is the tiger and who is the goat? The ones in a group are the goats. The one who is alone is the tiger. Buddy, looks like the tiger is here. Looks like it's going to pounce on us. [bleating like goats] Fine, we are goats. And you are a tiger. Now, show us your game. May your heart's desire come to fruition. I don't know this game. Who is this? What's going on? Brother, he's the one. That guy! That guy! Gora! I am Akhanda Rudra Sikander Gora. Destination is Kailash mountains. I enjoy skulls. My weapon is Trishul. My duty is to destroy evil. I am a soldier. I am Lord Shiva's soldier. So? Why would you hit us just because we gambled a bit? I didn't hit you because you gambled, you donkey! I hit you because you removed the idol. You must tell us if we made a mistake unknowingly. Why would you resort to violence? Are they kids that they need to be cajoled and educated with offerings of chocolates? If you mess with divinity, your jaw will be broken. What is it with you? Whenever you talk, you keep threatening us with that Trishul. Are you going to stab us? Why would I need to use the Trishul to stab someone without honor, you donkey? Donkey? This is our hamlet, our village and it's our wish. We will do what we please with it. Did you build this temple? - No. Then, how can you destroy the temple that was built by someone else? Do you know how much effort goes into the establishment of a temple? Do you know how much energy comes out of it? Chanting, prayers, the divine texts, the holiness of the land is calculated, the Vedas, Dharmas, the treatises on beginnings and decorations, the treatises on prayers to be offered, the rules that dictate the worship... All these are examined. The power of the place is calculated and then the structure is built. That is when it becomes a temple. Do you know the value and the glory of the idol that sits at the temple's core? The god of this Kali era Lord Venkateshwara, comes to the preach about the equality of all beings. Lord Sri Rama comes to preach the tenets of Dharma. Lord Sri Krishna comes to preach life truths. Lord Shiva comes to preach the tenets of the soul. Lord Anjeneya comes to give courage. Lord Ganesha for auspicious beginnings. Goddess Laxmi for wealth and prosperity. Goddess Saraswati for knowledge. The mother goddess comes forth to give the power of all the gods in the universe. The priests call upon all these divine beings for the protection that the temple offers you. And you turn the idols that are imbued with such divine power into playthings? Stop it. You are right. But, the science of this world has developed so much. Why are you giving a lot of importance to an invisible God? If you contract a life-threatening disease, where would you go? - To the hospital. Well then, why is there a temple in front of the hospital? The doctors pray to the God by asking for his guidance and support while operating to save a person's life. Why is it? It is because they believe that there is God's will behind every action of theirs. And the scientists who you hail, the very ones who send rockets from Sri Hari Kota, place the first designs of the rockets at God's feet and ask for his benevolence and guidance. Why is it? It is because they believe that the God is with them and would help them fulfill their mission. God is the father of all creation. Nature is the mother. The child born of that union is knowledge and science. This is truth. Learn it. Ask for god's mercy instead of asking for him to appear in front of you. Please, ma'am... Please. Sir, please. No, it's not possible. Please, ma'am... Please. Please get in the car, madam. You as well.Please... Please. Please come. Ma'am, please. - Sir... Sir... Sir... We know... We know. You sit down. If there is a blast in the hospital, it should lead to the death of people who've come there from different areas. But the people who've died are all from a single region. I asked you about that report. Yes, sir. It is ready. It is said that those people joined the hospital because they were suffering from radiation poisoning. The reason for it is Varadha Mines. But that is not correct, sir. I personally visited the site and investigated it. There are just copper mines there, sir. There is no possibility of any presence of radiation, sir. Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Hello? Is that so? Remove the cameras. I am not clear on whether you are a farmer or a criminal. Just now, I was offered 100 crores to kill you. That is a big amount. It's double my weight. This phone call must not have been exclusive to me. Anyone else could have gotten the exact same call. They say that society is protected by God and gun. God might not be tempted upon listening to this offer. But anyone with a gun would be tempted. I came here to close the case. Don't take this so far that it would end with you being killed. What exactly happened? Same bloody old silence! They won't tell me why you should be killed. And you don't tell me why they killed either. Who will tell the truth? Who is going to tell the truth? Hail Lord Shiva! Sir, the operations in Varadha Mines is not regarding copper mining. It is regarding dangerous uranium extraction. I have all the necessary proofs regarding this. They are scared that Mr. Murali Krishna might bring this truth to life and that is why they are doing this to him. Sir, I will be there with all these files in an hour. I need to meet with Krishnamacharya. They say that if a woman opens her mouth, it would lead to wars. You opened your mouth. Hundreds of kids died. And he is in custody. Thousands of people are buried in the earth. Some fellow came and disturbed me by killing my brother. When I was in the midst of dealing with that guy, you've started with your antics. Hey, -Mother! No! Are you going to stop me? Come. Mother! -No. No. He is a kid. Your anger is towards me. Do what you want with me. Please let my kid go. Please don't hurt him. - Mother! His son must watch this. Look. Mother! No! Mother! If you challenge me because you belong to a particular department in the government, and you have some misplaced notion of public service, and some such nonsense... Go and do what you want. Take the kid away! Hail the supreme god. You are someone who knows his birth and life journey. You must also know about how he's going to die, don't you? That is why I brought this. If a deer is surrounded by 25 cheetahs... they would jump on it, all at once. When they keep tearing the bone and flesh off the body of the deer, what will happen to the life of that deer? What will happen if there is a lion in place of that deer? Up until then, that vengeful lion kept a lid on the emotions of anger, pain, revenge, lust, arrogance. Once it opens its eyes and throws its fiery gaze around... Imagine if Lord Shiva turned himself into a bow, with Lord Vishnu as his weapon. And wore Sri Hari as his armor and begins the war? How would that look? This is Varadha Rajulu. - It's Lord Shiva himself there. He is going to die. He will come. Tell him to come. - He is here. Akhanda... Mother! Mother... Don't cry, mother. Get up. Don't cry. Mother, look here. Please, mother. He showed you my death. God is going to show you his death. Look there! I have a Mine. I am arrogant. I have a following. I have a teacher... and a bald-headed man... If you mess with mother earth hiding behind such excuses, your root chakra will be destroyed. Your sacral chakra will be destroyed. Your solar plexus chakra will be destroyed. Your Heart chakra will be destroyed. Your throat chakra will be destroyed. Your third eye chakra will be destroyed. Your crown chakra will be destroyed. Hail Lord Shiva! Offering it all to Lord Shiva. A lot of you people have died. Do you want to lose more? Gun down. Gun down. What is the meaning of this blood bath? This isn't about killing people. I cleaned up pollution. Polluting the nature has become a passion for every loon. That is why we've started this. Dust cleaning. Another word for it is pest cleaning. Killing of the germs. Why are you walking away? He is a criminal. But, you must hand him over to us. Why would you kill him? What are you going to do if I hand him over? - We are going to throw him in the prison. You would just throw him in the prison. - I threw him into hell. The one who corrupts the earth and nature has no right to live. We will not leave him alone We will slay him. We will chase him and slay him. If a child misbehaves, its very own mother would use physical force to chasten. Do you think mother earth would stay quiet? She asked me to chasten him and that is what I did. -Order sir. In one shot, I'll finish him. -Hey, no. Wait. What are you doing? -Tamed dog. You are dog that's been domesticated. You can only bark. You must not growl. You have a young school-going daughter who needs her father. That is why I'm leaving you without shortening your lifespan. As an ascetic, the Hindu religion you believe said this... Non-violence is the highest moral virtue. Correct yourself. That is just half the sacred verse used to control aggression. Do you know what Haindava Dharma says? Ahimsa Pramodharmahah Dharma Himsa tadivacha. Do you know what it means? Non-violence is the highest moral duty of mankind. So too is violence in the service of the highest Dharma. That is exactly what happened. From now on, if a man crosses his limits, this is exactly what's going to happen to him. Sir, no matter what you say, according to law, anyone who takes away another person's life is a criminal. That doesn't apply to me. Doesn't apply to you? Are you not a human being like us? Never! Your world and my world are not the same, officer. You've studied the justice system. I believe in Dharma. Both are not same. You keep searching for God. I live together with God. Both are not same. Your family is your world. For me, the entire world is my family. Both are not same. You search for life. I search for death. Both are not same. You people are someone who cannot even hold a piece of ice on the palm of your hand for even a few minutes. We are people who brave the cold and live in those eternally cold mountains. Both are not same. If you face a problem, you beg for god's graces. We put an end to that problem itself. Just like this. Both are not same. You chant mantras for the life of man. And if that very life is in danger, we fight wars. A very horrible war. Horn is blown aloud Said to clean up the dirt We don't fear for death Sound of the righteousness Said to do a war Ready for anything Hey ferocious man, world is your playground Come on hey man of magic, the world is yours Come hey Lord Siva Lord with plaitsWin over Hey lord! Hail to Akhanda! Plant your flag with the magic over this world Hail to Akhanda! Fill eyes of those suffering with affection "Who is this?" "Who is that?" "Cut down this head and that head" "Chase, search, break joints and chop" Hail to Akhanda! Plant your flag with the magic over this world Hail to Akhanda! Fill eyes of those suffering with affection Holy man. The child. Call for the expert of mantra and tantra, Kedari Agori Baba, from Kashi. Some evil spell has been cast on her. Holy man! Come. While I was searching for his strength, I found out about his weakness. I made a move that's going to result in his death. Until now, weren't we at the receiving end? Now, when we hit back, he must die. Deploy. No matter in which corner your strengths lie, deploy them. This is the final opportunity. Deploy your strengths. You've invested yourself in this relationship. They've invested in your weakness. Don't you know that our journey is antithetical to relationships? My destination is Lord Shiva. What if the mission that you wanted to give life to, asks for your life in return as a sacrifice? Let's do it. Get everything ready for the Fire sacrifice ritual. Akhanda... The most powerful force that can change the impossible into possible in this world, that can command the coming together of nine planets and command the constellation of stars... This is only possible with surrendering and sacrificing something to the gods. It is the most powerful weapon given to hold on to our dear lives, by the very Lord Shiva who destroys. The great Lord who can change the lines of fate written by Lord Brahma, the one who returns all the beings in the universe to their elemental forms. This is the only way to tell that Supreme Lord our pleas. But the end result is that Supreme Lords. Rudra, until this ritual is completed, you are a prisoner to the Shiva Panchakshari mantra. You are the protector of this ritual. Yours is the will, the accomplishment is Lord Shiva's. Begin! Gawa, he is right now locked as a prisoner to the Shiva Panchakshari mantra. Until that child's life returns, he isn't going to stop chanting nor is he going to turn his head. Even if Lord Shiva comes and calls him, he will not get up. In the meanwhile, Death should touch him. Begin! Why are you hitting him here and there? Hit him on the head. Brugu.. Gawa, he is at the last stage of chanting of the mantra. You must make sure you distract his focus from God. Dwa.. My child. Akhanda. The ritual is over. The child is awake! Something's gone wrong. He is not human now. It's Lord Shiva. We need to stop him. Surround him. He carries river Ganga on his head. Fire on his forehead. Poison in his throat. The nature carries the entire world in its womb. And you mess with it? You dare take away the lives of the young and innocent children who are the purest form of the supreme lord? You dare touch the third eye?! Father. Father. Son, the bond between the son and mother carries on for seven lifetimes. Sir, please. Sir, Sir, please listen to me. Holy man. Holy man. Holy man. Holy man, where are you going? When will you come back? Everyone is sad that you are leaving. Aren't you sad? I don't desire anything, dear. What about me then? The very moment I was born, Lord Shiva cut off all my ties to relationships and affection, friendship and enmity. Did he break your relationship with me as well? Mother said that. Is the soul in me yours! If you leave, it will leave with you too. You shouldn't say that, my dear. Don't leave me and go, Holy man. Don't leave me and go, Holy man. Don't go, holy man. Don't go, holy man. I want you, Holy man. Don't go, holy man. I am giving you my promise, dear. If you are in difficulties or destruction, in fear or in pain, or if you face death, no matter where I am or in what condition I am, I will be there before you in a minute. This is my promise. Baba (Holy man)
