Static background noise. You shouldn't get that, anyway. So, as I sat here in the camp, by myself, I decided to go through my language, uh, Ojibwe language, and put some things on there to use for later and this is what I got. Now... That's creepy. The one after this.. I have never had a recorder do that. I have, once before. And it was at the Delta Farm. It was definitely considered to be pretty haunted. Uh, so just to double check, I did it again... Testing one, two, three. Now that's.. that's the third one, let me do number five. All we get is straight static and I just held it. Yeah, well, Amy.. Now, doesn't that sound like, I'm like walking around or doing.. It doesn't even sound like that, it doesn't sound like.. I'm just sitting. It doesn't sound like randomness, it's.. I mean it's static. That's what he said, it sounds almost like a pattern. I don't think it's a pattern, something's in there. But didn't you say you had some weird static coming in over your headphones? I had static on the headphones and the weird thing is is that I didn't realize... 911, what is your emergency? Yes, yes, I'm calling from the island and we have four kids up here and they are extremely sick. We need to get 'em to a hospital, now! Calm down, Sir. You need to tell me what made them sick. I'm not.. I don't know. Is it something they ate? God, I.. I don't know. We're all stranded out here. We need to get off the island, now. Okay Sir, please try to hold the phone. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. How many kids are sick? Um, four. Four kids. What are their ages? Oh, for Christ's sake just send someone! We're heading out, Sir. Sir? What's going on? Sir? Reported missing from a small island... Island of Lies. You look as lost as I am. I just wanna go home. I just wanna go home. I wanna.. I wanna take a long bath. I wanna take a nice, long bath... and I'm not gonna do this anymore, I'm not gonna do this ever again. I call 'em and they answer, every fucking time. They don't shut the fuck up. But when I need 'em and I'm lost in the middle of the fucking woods. Nothing... I got nothing. The fuck? I'm sorry, Jimmy. Sorry, Paul... Jennifer... Kate... Lola and Arlie, were in charge, I wasn't. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you. I was just a kid, too. I was scared. I'm sorry. Here's one. So far nobody is calling me back. Hi, hello there's a message for Dan. Striking out big time here. Ten messages so far. Hi, is this Chuck? Chuck Harb? Hey, Chuck, hi. Uh, this is Chris from Dogbyte Motion Pictures and we're doing a documentary on the Garden Island 19.. Yeah. Well, we just need some information, we wanna talk to some people about, you know, what might have happened at that particular point in time. You interested? Um, well the significance of this location is what.. It's an undisclosed, uh, location in a cemetery, up here in, Kent County, Michigan. And the reason why we're here is because over that hill, over there, there is a memorial. There's actually, four of them. Uh, they went to Garden Island, which is up north, um, uh, in Lake Michigan. And unfortunately, uh, those four kids didn't make it back. Garden Island was originally inhabited by the Ojibwe Tribe about 2,000 years ago is what we're finding. Um, they pretty much lived in peace until the white man came over. Um... most of the Ojibwe Tribe were killed by a Small Pox epidemic. Now, if they found out that the, uh, government, that the white man, had caused this disease they would be increasingly angry. And I can definitely see where all the anger would channel to become a very powerful force in the supernatural. We're going to be doing a lot of audio recordings to see if we can capture EVP, which is, "electronic voice phenomenon." Um, now as for other aspects, uh, we could see just about anything. We can be seeing shadows, we could see actual apparitions. They had several creatures that they believed in and they also believed in shape-shifters as well. I'm excited, I'm excited to see what we can find.. what we can find with research. Um, no I would not want to come up against a creature, but, uh, on the paranormal aspect, I cannot wait to get up there and see what we can document. What are you gonna do if you see a creature? Probably run. It was the first time we'd ever gone to the island. When we got there, it was beautiful, you know? Warm, sunny, gorgeous Michigan day that, um, you know, you couldn't be better being out there on a lake and... and four of the kids went off... hiking and accidentally discovered this old, Indian burial ground there. It was right about that time that everything sorta changed. We got three days of nothing but rain, cold. All four of the kids got sick. Katie, Jennifer, Paul and Jimmy... were all sick. The boys were feverish and nauseous and... the girls were kinda cold and pale and... and then Katie started getting delirious, so... a couple of us decided we'd head on over to the rangers, the conservation camp on the island and see if we could get some help for 'em. When we got back the next morning and... all four of the kids were gone. I mean... nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything. I still have dreams, almost every night that he's still alive on that damn island somewhere. In fact, uh, it's always the same thing. He's standing on the edge of these woods with his back to me and I start to call his name and just as he is about to turn and look at me... I wake up in a cold sweat. Every time with my heart thumping. Man, it really did a number on our mom too, she... She never really got over it. I was working dispatch that night and got the distress call. They wanted an immediate airlift out. We couldn't move the plane because of the fog. The next day, it was about 7:00 am, still had thick fog, so we took the boat. That guy searched the entire island and nothing. They were there for three days. Nothing. I know it's been years, but, I can't stop thinking about it. I need to know what happened to him. What happened on that... that island. It's a tiny island, there's nothing there, four kids can't just disappear off the face of the earth. It's been more than 20 years since this happened, but, I was.. I was his big brother. I should have been there to help him, I mean, I'm.. That's my job, I'm supposed to protect him but, I wasn't and he's.. and he's gone. We're here in Charlevoix. Um, Michigan and it is an absolutely beautiful town. We're gonna go over here and see if we can get an interview. See if anybody, perhaps went past.. They have tours that go around Garden Island and Whiskey Island. Garden Island's owned entirely by the state of Michigan and it's the closest island to Beaver Island. Right there, right above Beaver Island. Have you been there? I haven't been there. Um, I've been by it. And I drove all the way around. We did a lighthouse tour and we went all the way up around it and come through this channel with the boat a couple of times. There's quite a bit of, um, ancestral burial grounds. Even though a lot of people don't actually know about it. You know, it's only a mile off Beaver Island, but yet a lot of people don't know about it. It also supports a lot of snakes and a lot of other wildlife so it's.. it's not an island that's for everybody. Would it be easy to get lost? Yeah, yes. Mm-hmm. There are some paths but you'd have to stay on 'em. Um, lots of poison ivy. Well.. You really should be, uh, somewhat experienced in, uh, you know, hiking and.. If you want to venture out. When an American Indian dies, specifically of the Ojibwe culture, it's traditional to bury them and then build a structure on top of their grave. There are 3,500 graves. Most of them don't have spirit houses. They're unmarked. So... Pretty much from my understanding, anywhere that you go on the island there's the possibility that there is, um, somebody buried beneath you which is particularly intriguing, um, since we're bringing a paranormal crew with us. Um, my best advice would be not to go to Garden Island. It's haunted and, uh, you know, I've heard of voices and just crazy things that happen there. I know there's been a lot of mishaps over the years of people boating, people getting stranded on Garden Island. And if you go just be prepared that you won't come back the same. You'll never leave the same. A lot of the Ojibwe's that lived on Beaver Island went to Garden specifically to plant corn and squash. So, they had an extensive agricultural-type society there. And the odd thing is that there was a whole other population of individuals that lived on the opposite side of the island. They built a saw mill. They had a small town there. And, one of the questions we have or was the fact that, did these people live in harmony? Were there lines drawn? How the interactions happened? If there was any discontent that occurred on the island. Garden Island became somewhat of a ghost town with a small pocket of native Ojibwe's still living on the island but gradually they started to just succumb to illness, and by 1900 most of the population had dwindled. The last full-time Native American resident of the island was named Peter Monatou. And he lived there all by himself and... ultimately he died in 1940. So, since 1940, there hasn't been any full time residents of the island itself. Four children from Explorer Group 715, a youth mentorship program based in Grand Rapids, were reported missing from a small island located in northern Lake Michigan. Law enforcement and search and rescue groups were dispatched to investigate the area where the children were last seen. When search and rescue arrived on the island they reported that the group's campsite was found undisturbed but abandoned. The search and rescue crew remains on the island looking for the missing children and law enforcement officials are investigating the whereabouts of these children as they find the incident highly suspicious and suspect foul play. If you have information on the where abouts of these children you can call the State Police anonymous tip line at area code 616-450-1537. You must have some kind of theory. I mean, four kids. you know, just don't vanish and nobody ever found anything from what I hear. I have no idea. I have no idea what happened up there. There's some... stuff about some Indian curse on the island and... that's about all I know. I.. You know, I've had a lot of it blocked from my mind. I.. It's not a pleasant part of my life. Hi Mr. Hammons. Hi, this is Chris from Dogbyte Films we talked on the phone. I had a couple questions for you about the... 1989 trip to Garden Island. I just wondered if you could tell me a little bit about what might of happened? What's with this? It's like for YouTube or something? No we're actually doing a full blown documentary about the events of '89 and we really wanna know, you know, how you can have, you know, supervised children on an island and they just kinda vanished. I don't know. I mean, we knew its history. You know, back in '61... same thing happened. It was like Boy Scouts or something. Just... vanished. Being an adult in a, kind of, a supervisor role do you feel somewhat responsible? They vanished... Did you guys hear or see.. without a trace. There we have it. I think it's good for me to go on this thing and, uh... try to see if there's something else... Um... I used to fish up at Garden Island all the time. My friends and I would go up there a lot. Hell, everyone was up there and the fishing was so fucking amazing that we used to refer to it as Success Island. I'm fine. Uh... Hey, maybe this will help things for me, I don't know. I.. Maybe you'll get some closure on some things. Like what? Closure's bullshit. There is no closure. Yeah, we'd heard about the reports of the missing children. And everyone knew that there was a pattern there because that was not the first time it had happened. And, uh, if you wanna talk to the Indians, they'll tell you all about it, but I would just say good luck finding one. Uh, it's just.. there was something just very menacing and creepy about it and, I, uh, I've got the sense to stay away from there. We are packing to go up north. Once we get up there we're going to get on a ferry to Garden Island. It's hard camping out there. This ain't, uh, you know, a public camp ground. Nobody lives there. There's no water, no electricity. It's Colorado dude. Well, let.. No, still we have a Colorado map, nice. The island is full of mosquitoes and full of seven different species of snakes, coyotes... I'm at eight now. Oh.. No wait. That's two. Amateurs. Well, you point the compass north and then you know where you are. You know, wind-up flashlight, compass, glow sticks, tin cup. We go up here by Charlevoix. Take the ferry to Beaver Island, which is up here... Yeah. And then we actually gotta take a private boat to get to Garden. Tons of flashlights. I probably got 20 flashlights with me. So I'm.. And a blow dryer and fingernail polish... Yes. Yeah. Sophia? We're gonna paint your nails when you fall asleep. Your toe nails. I probably won't be sleeping. Hey, what do we got for food you guys? What are we eating? First aid kit complete with IV and everything. This is a six-man tent. 'Cause we know how you like multiple layers of men. I do. Are you filming me right now? No. Clothes. Hello. Hello, hello. God I can't.. God, I wish I could do that. I'm jealous of your squeaking. It's the only talent I have. I know I've seen your films. Look out fuckers, media coming through. Oh. I'm good. Plenty of trouble, honey. I have an entourage. What did you want? Camel Crush. What? Camel Crush. You can tell her. Yeah. She would like Camel Crush. You were asking me. Got some Camel Crush. Have you put it in the cooler, Sophie? You won't be able to drink it and when we get up there it's gonna be gone. You guys can drink warm then 'cause we're gonna have cold. Oh, lucky you. It's booze cruisin'. Lucky you. Booze cruise. Booze cruise. Where are you? Tell me? Uh, Big Rapids. Yeah. Pulled over to get some gas. You got to gas? Uh, yeah and I filled up the car too. Hey! So we're probably about what, 200 more miles? I don't know it was like 300 about five minutes ago. I love this song. Yeah? It's like a really kind of hippie influence. Yep. It's like a... Yep. I could pop a Quaalude right now. I got a bottle of Diet Cream Soda Faygo style in the house. Ooh, yummy. ♪ Well it's an okay evening For a drive ♪ We got Chuck's going like a fucking bat outta hell right now. He's keeps speeding up and then he'll slow down... I know. And then when you catch up with him he'll speed up again. He's got a really odd driving pattern. He's, like, competitive, lazy driving. It's kind of a combination of both. Your GPS lied. We are.. We were going in the wrong direction for what, ten, fifteen minutes? No, like three. Oh, it seemed like ten minutes. Is it this thing here? I guess. It lies! We are in Charlevoix and it is, like, 11:00 p.m. at night and we made it up here. It was a nice, like, little detour we took there. I don't know what you're talking about. It was.. That was very.. It was the Magellan. Mm. Oh so, you guys are nice and drinking up, huh? (Mumbles) That'll wet your whistle. This is our paranormal expert. Over here we have Mrs. Sophia Maslowski. Hi, nice to meet you. Hello. Hi. Boom mic, sound stuff, some camera stuff, some interview stuff. Cool. And here we have, Chuckster. How you doing? If you heard about Chuck he's one of the original members of the original expedition in '89. We have Amy who's gonna be helping with cameras and... Hi. Sound equipment. Nice to meet you. Hi, Amy, hi. How do you feel? All right. Salute. Salute. Salute. We got this one bouncing off the walls. Her Adderall's obviously... No I haven't taken any Adderall... Kicking in. I'm just tired of sitting. Good morning. Good morning. It's like a half mile down... It's a half mile down... That way. There's a shuttle. So, we gotta get cracking. Hey, don't throw my lucky charm, just like.. Like.. Sorry. This is.. This is a.. Like it means nothing. This is a very personal item for me. Well, my mistake. Thank you. ♪ My girl, my girl don't lie to me ♪ ♪ Tell me where did you sleep last night ♪ ♪ Come on, tell me baby ♪ ♪ In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine ♪ ♪ I would shiver the whole night through ♪ ♪ My girl, my girl where will you go? ♪ ♪ I'm going where the cold wind blows, where's that baby? ♪ ♪ In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't even shine ♪ ♪ I would shiver the whole night through... ♪ It looks about the same.

We're gonna take the burlap and I'm gonna grab a cigarette from one of you guys and take it apart, put the tobacco in it because that was one of the standard gifts that was given was tobacco. Garden Island is used as a meeting place for the.. the Native American Indians. Also important as a burial spot, it's the largest burial, uh, Native American burial ground pretty much in the Great Lakes. Mazel Tov. Cheers, Mazel.. Cheers. Cheers. We'll see. I looked for three missing people right about here for, like, three days. Yeah, we lost three of our local people here in a fishing accident. So, a lot of tragedy that happens here. I don't know. I'm getting a lot of, uh... There's a lot of mixed stuff going on in here right now. So, I don't know. It's just a lot of things are coming back and... No, we're gonna do like a three person kind of.. Hey, Chris? Chuck. Yes, Chris, the man of reason. What am I hopping on? Step and then to the deck you'll go. Fat man. It's your color. Uh, no comment. Oh, smart ass. Purple isn't in. It's your color though, Chuck. Was this.. Are you talking about right there where it's taped? Well, we just had to tape it. Yes. The second I put it up, it snapped. Snapped. It's too tight because we can't zip this. It can hear sound but just not through the headphones. All right, now I've got sound. Is that a real song? ♪ I won't have to talk ♪ ♪ I won't have to talk no more ♪ There's spirit houses and... They're supposed to be alive and active. A lot of people don't want to come here because it's haunted. What we're hoping to do here today is to possibly document paranormal activity. Um, we're hoping from some of the Indian natives from here. I'm Dan Holroyd I am the founder and president of SMP, Southern Michigan Paranormals. Uh, I'm in cooperation with Nicole, uh, out here to help do some paranormal investigating of the Native American, uh, sites on the island as well as assist with your crew. Um, I have Ojibwe in my family. And my great-grandmother was Ojibwe. This is an EMF, uh, standard EMF meter. Uh, we have a natural electromagnetic field around the earth and around most everything around us. Um, this will detect changes in that field. The theory is in paranormal investigating, is that when we have something that interferes on a medium to large scale uh, when there's no other power source around, uh, both of these are designed to, as you see with this one with the dummy gage on it, uh, they are to monitor that and they will also show you that there's interference in that magnetic field. Spray yourself heavily. Don't drink it or nothing. But, uh, yeah. Uh, no one wants to get sick or get bit by some God awful bugs so, be sure you have all that shit ready. I want to go to my tent and get mine right now. We stopped at the liquor store, get the booze, and then he's been drinking beer, beer, beer. And then on the ferry ride here he's been drinking. He's drinking like.. He's had probably eight beers since we've been here. We've only been here what? An hour trying to set up camp? Uh, I gotta keep up appearances, don't I Craig? Craig? Oh, now I'm really insulted. Whatever the fuck your name is, I don't know. So, we're going deep into the woods. Can I have everybody do a radio check, please? Okay, radio check. Hey, radio check. I need to get my radio. You.. you got my radio check? Yeah. You guys got your meters? Yep. Yeah. Everybody's got their radios? We're good to go? Good to go. All right, let's go. Bucko water. All right. Did you guys hear that in the woods over here? I just had it. Look over here. I just had a spike right here too. No shit? Yup. Shoot your camera that way, Amy. What way? Over in the woods, right here. Did you hear that? Probably just an animal or something, Chris. Why's your exposure level down? Did we get any type of hits there, Dan? I did right there. Down here? Okay. Going there. Ah, you know I wouldn't recommend that. Stick to the trail. Don't get separated. I'm not hearing anything any more. Okay. It's probably just an animal. All right. Buzzing animal? Are you ready? All right. You guys are documenting this stuff? This means something, right? Yeah. All right, let's go. Are we ready? I'm ready. Are you still getting it? Dan? It's these trees, man. That's creeping me out, big time. Yup, I'm getting interference periods of... which I never get on, these are Sennheiser mics. They're pretty clean. Are we all together now? Everybody? Got a big fly on your back dude. Well, can you get it off? What the fuck are you doing here? Get the fuck outta here! All right, all right. Oh, fuck, Craig they got cameras. Shut the fucking cameras off! Shut 'em off! Shut 'em off! Shut 'em off! Shut the fucking camera off. What the fuck are you doing, dude? You shut the fuck up and shut that camera off. This is state property. Get that gun out of my face! This is state property, man. We have the right to be here just like you. No you don't! I got the guns and you don't have the right... Go, go, go, go, go, go. Shut the fucking camera off. Go, just go. What do you have to say, huh? We're making a documentary. We have every right to be here. Just like you, Put that fucking gun down! Hey fat boy! Fat boy! Call the fucking cops! Move it fat boy! Get the fuck outta here! Call the fucking cops! Get the fuck out of here. Fucking do it pussy! I will. Do it. Chuck, Chuck, stop it! Move it fat boy! Move it fat boy! Do it! Do it! Don't touch my gun you fuckin' ass. Pussy! Sophia, come on, stop. (Muttering) Sophia come on. Come on! Are you fucking serious? Shh. Stop. No, we'll circle around, okay? We'll circle around. Come back, here. Sophia. Sophia, come back here. All right let her go, let her go. Stop, stop. Just chill out, you guys. You can't let her go. Do not let her go. We can't abandon anybody up here. Sophia. Get back here. We'll just bypass them from now on, okay? All right. Let's go. You all right? You all right? Everything's good? Everything's good. Dude, I'm shaking. That scared the fuck out of me, man. You're not the only one. I'm freaking out. We're all shaking. Can we just, like, keep walking? Lets.. I don't know, hold on. Let's just regroup, okay? I don't wanna go anywhere right now. I'm sorry, you guys. Okay, you just told me to stop crying and you start crying. Well, think of it, man, it's a family business, you know. This has probably been going on for 20.. No, I.. No. Look, all this meth shit is new. Pot farmers and stuff here would be really cool and mellow. Like, no one comes up here. They're not gonna need guns and shit. They were cooking meth and it wasn't up here when we.. when I was up here. We're Indi right? Indian.. Indian Harbor? Yeah. Correct? So, what I'm seeing here is the little trail, that's that trail. Right. And didn't the guy from the boat say we turn left it's gonna Y off and we turn left... Yeah. To get up to the Indian burial ground and then we hang a right at that oak tree. Right. Okay, well look what's sitting where we're at. It says a site of Indian village. Hello? Weird shit, creepy. Hello? Is somebody out there? Hello? Just, uh, let's not draw attention. Hello? It's probably just an animal or something. Uh... What the hell is that? I heard something out there. Let's, uh, let's keep walking. It's around here somewhere. Hello? You don't hear it? Yeah, I heard it. Yeah, stop. What the hell is that? There. Right there. Right there, up ahead. Hey guys, can you come over here? I think I might have found something. Yeah we're on our way right now. Where is she? Where are you? You went ahead of us. Yup, come on through the trail and it curves around to the right and just keep going. You'll see me. Chuck? Come and shoot this, Amy. Take a shot of this. Get this. What is it? I don't know yet, I haven't gotten it out. Hold on. Hold.. This is.. This is Jimmy's hat. That's.. That is it. That's evidence man. I.. I.. You should put that back. It's not gonna have fucking fingerprints on a hat that's 20 something years old, Chris. Just for now. There's no reason to put it back. They're not gonna dust for prints on this thing anymore. Okay, all right. Let me do a quick narration on what we found so put it back at least so I can do that. Here we are, it's June 15th and we're on Garden Island and about, uh, two, two and a half miles into the trail. We took a fork in the trail, Nicole calls us, we find this hat which appears to be the hat from Jimmy... Barnes. Barnes. Jimmy Barnes from the expedition in 1989. Let's just go right now, all right? We found the camp site. Now we know where it is. We have it on film. I'm so sorry Chuck. It could be any fucking... All right, can we go? Yeah.. Yippee we found a hat. We found a fucking old hat. Do you know the way back? From where we came from. Let's go. Just go follow the trail down there. We were, like, really into them and... he was a good kid. Me and Jimmy did a lot of shit together. He was like the only one that... didn't fucking tease me and shit. So, I guess.. Do you feel like we need to move on? Do you wanna continue this project? Yeah, I wanna know what happened to Jimmy. I'm just gonna be here a while, okay? Are we gonna just wait here for him, then? No, just go, just go. It's over. Okay. Just let him be. All right. One more take. The expedition 2012, um, starting out kind of rough. We did get ambushed by some, um, really angry... um, guys with some really big guns and that was some pretty decent footage. Especially watching the crew react to that. Um, also found the original camp site and some suspected evidence which was a red hat um, which looks like one of the original campers. You know, hopefully we'll have something to put together for this project, um, again hoping, but, uh, we'll see. All right. Oh, He's here but.. Easy now. Easy now. He's here. I'd like to thank the Academy. Speaking of.. Thank you so much. It's a GoPro. I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you. If I'm forgetting anybody's names I'm so sorry. Thank you, I love you. Thank you. Okay, so you know how to turn that thing on? The on button. It's just like a regular camera. You push that button. You talk dirty to it. And it'll beep. And then when you wanna roll just hit the top one. That's the shutter release. So, when we go to bed at night that goes on. Okay. Sweet. It's third grade third, fourth grade humor. Okay. We don't expect anything more from you, so... Fuck off Penny. Stay behind the camera. Quit fucking commenting. I think you're building it way up, Chuck, so just tell the joke. Fine, fine. No fuck it. No, joke's done. Come on, tell the joke. I'll just give you the punchline. Oh, it was hilarious. Ah, the punchline is, I looked all over my hairy butt hole but I can't find my crack. There's your punchline. Make your own fucking joke. Thank you very much. Boy humor and girl humor at that age are so different. I don't even remember what we thought was funny but, it wasn't that kind of stuff. I don't remember girls being funny at third and fourth grade. They were all bitches. I said my punchline, you give a punchline. You can't even remember the joke, you fucking joke. If you wanna cue me in on the punching thing... Oh, he's gotta go punch his clown. I don't like to hear squishy soft sounds... All fucking night long. I'll take the watch tonight, you guys. Go. All right, let's do this thing. Take care of your bottles, fuckers. Are you gonna film me all night or you going to sleep, Chris? I'm going to sleep after you get situated. Fine. What do you wanna film us doing in here? You know, I thought Chris.. Jesus. What if they come behind me? I'm fucked. Actually, quite literally yes. Push the shutter release. Which is the top one? Presumably. I do know. Do you know? All right. Try it and see what happens. Ah, red light on mean recording. Chuck... Over here, Chuck... Chuck... Chuck, over here... Over here, Chuck... Chuck! Chuck! You guys see anything? No, I can't find him anywhere. I haven't seen him. He's not over here. Chuck? Sophia anything? No, I've been looking everywhere. I cannot find him. It's.. And it's really black out here. I.. I'm calling him, everything, no response. You guys might wanna come down here. Okay, um, me and Sophia are gonna meet up and, uh, we'll be down there in a minute. Tell me if I'm going north, south, east or west 'cause I have no idea. Head towards the water. I'm on my way. You were standing here that whole time? I don't know, Chris. I.. Fucking, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't. How do you not know how long you were standing here? Dude we were calling you, we were yelling, we were radioing, and you didn't have your radio on. I don't know, Chris. I don't know how long, I was there. Where the fuck are you taking me? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know where the fuck we are. We're getting the fuck out of here. Well, as predicted it's raining. It's been raining all fucking day. I'm stuck in a tent. Everybody's bitching and whining. Tent's leaking of course. Hasn't rained in two weeks but the day I bring all my shit out, it's fucking pouring. Um, no story, nothing. Then, um, weird shit with Chuck. Found him standing underneath the tree last night decorated with feathers... tied to the branches. No doubt from the, um, the guys have been stalking us, some kind of scare tactic. I don't care. I'm not afraid. If they wanted to kill us, they had plenty of opportunities. I'm more interested now in just getting to the cemetery, getting the paranormal people up there, getting some EVP readings, whatever. I'll be back, um, tomorrow. Hopefully to fill you in on... what we find, if anything. (Muttering) Hey, Chuck. Hey. Chuck? What? Do you know where we are? Yes, I know where I am. Are you sure? I think we're going in circles. I'm seeing the same shit. As I saw back then. They're a bunch of trees Chris. They are gonna look the same. They all look the same. Do you know where we're going? We've been walking for six hours. The trail.. Do either of you guys know.. Shh. Do either of you guys know what's going on? Yes. Do you know where you're going? I don't. I don't know where I'm at. I can't see shit. I'm tripping on everything. It's been 20 years since I've been up here. Chuck, come on. Cut me some fucking slack. Well, what do you wanna do? You wanna go forward or you wanna go back? No.. If we go back we're gonna get more lost if we go forward... No, let's go forward. Who knows, probably end up coming back here in a half an hour. Let's go forward. Like we've been doing. Okay, there's a stump right here. You guys okay? Yeah. You don't know where we're going, Chuck. Can you shut your mouth just for a second? Come on. He's getting us lost. Shh, okay? Chuck. Chill out. Let's just get the hell out of here. Keep going. We're getting up to a three. Oh, no, not again. Yes, this is.. It's.. And it's going up. So, what.. Can you, uh, kinda explain that in layman's terms? Basically we should have less than a one for normal reading and up to a three, that signifies a strong disturbance in the, uh, magnetic field. Is that a positive or a negative? Um, this strong? Hmm, negative probably. Oh, okay. This strong, we are probably getting either close to something or being surrounded. We're in a Ojibwe Indian cemetery on Garden Island. We've been walking for hours and hours and hours and it's been rumored that the Indians that reside in this cemetery were decimated by the smallpox virus which was introduced to them by the, um, white population that settled in.. in this area. So, what we have here is a field of graves. I don't wanna do this. Guys, this is not a good idea. I don't wanna do this. This is not a.. Seriously? Seriously, this kind of rating.. We came all this way, spent all this time in the woods and you're gonna turn back? She knows this stuff and she's saying that this doesn't feel good. I don't think we should go in there. I agree. This high of reading something is wrong. They're paranormals, okay? They know what they're doing. Do you guys want to make this film or not? You wanna make this movie or not? We have been making this movie, I don't feel good about this. All right.. Seeing this in the day is different than at night. I just want to be really careful, Chris. I don't want to disturb any of these things. I don't wanna be here anymore. I don't even know what direction to go in anymore. I seriously don't know what direction we're supposed to be going anymore. Okay, okay, hold on. I don't know where we are. It's okay, Amy. We came in right over there. We just gotta remember to be... Hello? Can you guys hear me out there? Radio check. Yeah. For you and the guest, Chuck. I think we got something. Amy? Amy? Amy I'm not going over there. I'm not going there. We're going right here. There's.. There's a path right there. Chris we gotta leave an offering or something. Yeah I agree, I agree. I agree. Let's go, uh, ask Dan and Nicole what specifically we gotta do. Hold on. Can we get it again? Come on. It wasn't a fluke. Come on. It's gone. It's gone okay I think we can get it... The goosebumps again just walking up here. God! You see this shit? Is that real? Can you see that? Oh, my god. Yeah, it's fucking real. And what we just had was pretty real too. My meter on my battery just dropped about 15 minutes. Yup. It just lost power. Yup. I'm down to 45 minutes left. Chuck sir, can you hold these for me? I need to get some.. I need to get some photographs. (Ojibwe) (Ojibwe) You see that one over there? We thank you for allowing us in. We ask that you watch over us. Keep us safe. And we do this again, in respect... that my love... and respect to our great people. This is messed up stuff, Chris, really. (Ojibwe) You get some pictures? Oh your camera died, didn't it? My camera died. We can check out some pictures though. I got some battery issues. We gotta go. You all right, Chuck? Yeah. Guys, shh. Stop, stop, stop! Stop, look that way. You guys see that? Yup. Yeah. What do we wanna do? What do we do? What do we do? These guys are stalking us. Don't shine the light that way. No, no, no, no, no, no! These guys are fucking stalking us. Dude he's got a fucking laser beam. He's got a fucking laser. Go that way. Go, go, go, go, go! Go, guys. Shh. (Whispering) Turn your lights off. Off, off. Right off now! Get 'em off. Shh. Fuck he's got a damn laser. Holy shit! He's got a laser and it's right there. Get down, get down, get down! Get down! What the fuck man? What in the fuck is going on? Cover that fucking red light. Shit! Cover that red light. Oh, shut up. What the fuck man? Oh my God what are they doing? (Whispering) Go back that way. There's a fucking spider web. Go! Go, go. Go you guys, move. They're coming this way. Come on. I'm not fuckin around! Run! Dude they're right behind us. They're right behind us. They're right behind us. Go! We gotta go. What the hell did we do to those guys? What the hell did we say to those guys? I didn't say anything to them. I know you didn't say anything. No I don't think anybody said anything to them, Chris. They've been on us since we got here. Yes, they have. It's abundantly clear that it's.. they've been on us this entire time. What the fuck? This is state property. Yes, I know. We have every right to be here. We have every right to be here and I got it cleared. It was cleared, okay? That dude had a fucking laser pointer. I know.. I know he did. I know he did. Oh shit, I thought.. Man I hope I was rolling. Okay, I don't know if I was rolling or not. Shit! One more take. Uh, a lot of the footage so far has been overexposed, out of focus, uh, just rough. The worst part about it is, um... the most important thing, the cemetery, uh, looked at that footage, missed a lot of it, don't know how and... I got an awful distortion coming over my microphone. So, I'm heading out tomorrow morning and I am going to re-shoot some of that scene or some of that footage. See if I can salvage you know, what we have there. and then, um, come back and pack and get ready for the boat. And I'm out. And cut. Turn that light off. Turn the camera off. Wacky Wackerson. Fuck you. Anybody sees this... Fuck off. that sleeping bag right there... was fucking going up and down like a goddamn elevator. Whatever. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay, so at this point... I'm thinking this is total bullshit. I wanna go home... and if I don't go home, uh, I think that Chris's film is gonna be pretty simple. It's, uh, film crew goes to an island, film crew goes into the woods, film crew gets stalked and film crew is dead. The end. Oh, just give up this Indian paranormal fantasy thing. My God, please just give it up. Ugh. Insanely at the freaking cemetery. I looked at it this morning. It's awful. It's really bad. The audio was blown. All the audio channels are blown plus it's so dark and things are really blurry and grainy and shit. So, I'm gonna go run up to the cemetery. You're gonna go back to the cemetery? Yeah. After last night? It'll take me a half an hour. Chris, I don't think that's a good idea. Well, based on the footage I got I have to go back up there. And you didn't feel anything that took place last night? Nothing. No. I'm not gonna go back up there with you. Mm-mm. I think that we've kind of intruded and I don't wanna bring anything down on myself. Who's out there? Oh, fu.. Chuck, come on, man. Pick up your fucking walkie talkie. There's something out here. Chris! Chris! Chris? Chris! Chris! Where are you? Chris? Chris? Chris, where are you? Chris, where are you? (Mumbling) Fuck. What was that? Chris! Chris! Chris! Did he even have a fucking radio? Did you give him a radio? No, I didn't give him a radio. I don't have to be everybody's fucking parent. You didn't give him a radio? You've got a radio but he doesn't? You didn't give him one? Why am I responsible for what Chris does when he just takes off? Chris! Jesus. Chris! Chris! Unbelievable. Chuck do you have any fucking idea where we're going right now? Do you have any clue at all where we're going? I have an idea. It's been a long time since I've been up here, Amy. Okay. All right? Okay. You've got.. It's been a long time. You've got an idea. Everything is not the same, all right? You've got an idea. You have an idea. Is that all you have, Chuck? Is that all you have? Does your mouth keep running? It does. Actually it does, thank you for asking. Hold up. Did you hear that? Yeah. Chris? Chris? Chris? Oh my God. It's just getting darker and darker out and you don't even know where we're going. I don't know where we're going, do you? All I can say is I have an idea, all right? It changed, Amy! I haven't been up here forever. How many times do I gotta say this shit? Do you know what? I'm gonna actually get this. Hold on a second. Oh, Jesus Christ. Just for.. Just for posterity. Come on. Tell.. tell everybody.. Tell everybody what you just said to me. You are a fucking drama queen. You are a fucking drama queen! There we go. There you go, that's Chuck. That's Chuck everybody. What are you sick of this? You don't want to look for Chris anymore? You want to go back to camp? You know what? Yeah I do wanna go back to camp and I'm going to pretend like he's got a radio but his batteries are dead, okay? Is that all right with you? Is it okay with you? This isn't pretend, Amy. This isn't pretend anymore this is fucking real. Just because you're uncomfortable, lazy, hot, tired and scared doesn't mean we leave somebody out there. So, which one am I? You're all of those but which one am I? I'm hot, yeah. I have to look for Chris. I'm gonna look for Chris. I wanna look for Chris. I'm not abandoning anybody anymore out here. You wanna go back to camp 'cause you get so fucking tired. You're lazy and you're a fucking bitch! I'm sick of your mouth! You want to go back to camp and abandon fucking people go right the fuck ahead! See if I give a fuck! Go! Don't need your fucking mouth anyway. You're on your own. Go to hell. Go to hell. Amy, wait. Leave me alone. We can't leave each other. Come on. Leave me alone, okay? Amy, I'm sorry. Come on. We can't.. We can't separate. Come on, Amy. Leave me alone! Leave me alone. Amy, come on! We can't be alone out here. Amy, get back here, come on. Leave me alone! Fuck! Is there anybody here with us? (Whispering) (Distorted voices) It's definitely Ojibwe. How many of you are here? (Whispering) Amy, godammit pick up! I got nothing. I got nothing, right now. I gotta finish this project and I've got nothing. He won't shut the fuck up any other time except when I'm lost in the woods and I'm calling on a fucking radio. I'm sicker than shit... and I'm lost out here and I got nothing. I got no footage. Nothing worth a fuck! You gotta fucking pick up your radio. This project is fucking wasted. I gotta get my shit together. I gotta get back. They're stalking me. There's something stalking me. It's those guys or something in the woods. Goddammit you guys. You guys, please pick up. Guys who follow me are safe. Dan! We've got enough people missing. Dan come on. (Mumbling) Chuck? Hello? Hello Amy? Chuck? Where are you guys? Fucking Christ. Where the fuck are you? Holy fuck. Holy fuck. You guys it ain't them. I repeat it ain't.. Chris! Sophia! Chuck! This isn't working. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey guys. It ain't them. Chris? I repeat. So, um... I'm totally lost. I have no idea where anybody is. I just wanna go home... and I want to.. I wanna take a long bath.
