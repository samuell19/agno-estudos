Come on let's go. Mom, let me finish this one thing. Neema. The land won't farm itself. And no one will do it for us. Mom, wait a bit. Let's go now! We'll start here. What's the matter now? Thorns! Careful, it's toxic. And we can't afford injuries right now. It hurts. And it's my writing hand! Are you thinking of writing right now? How will you go to school when we have no food? Let's go. Keep going. It doesn't matter what I say. Mom doesn't think any good can come from schooling. It's not true, Neema. She's worked so hard to get you here. As usual. I used to top my class. I was top at Mathematics, English and even Physics but now I'm nowhere because I have no time to study. Is it only household chores that are causing all this? Yes, I do everything. Especially since the baby was born. I thought maybe there was another reason. Like what? You’re a beautiful girl, Neema. You know... Your mother has a lot on her plate. Tell her to come by. I'll try talk to her. I will try, but you know how my mother is. Her burden is hers alone to bear. Try to talk to her. I’ll try. Knock, knock. Gentlemen, welcome! Welcome. You’re very welcome! -Thank you. -You're very welcome. I’ve been sitting here waiting for you. Hello. -Hello young man, welcome. -Thank you. So pleased to finally meet you. Gentlemen, have a seat. Let me get us some drinks. Welcome. Fatuma! Fatuma! Fatuma, my dear! Did you brew the liquor? Who are those people? They are here for discussions my dear. To discuss what? A promise of sorts. A promise? What sort of promise? We must treat them well. Listen, in fact… We’ll treat them like family. Okay? Neema? Please bring us some liquor. We're waiting, okay? Gentlemen! This is my wife. She's one of the best brewers… So if you take this, and add it to this, you get that. I don’t get it. Okay. Let’s do it again. I’m going to fail. Why are you losing hope? Look here. Do you see these two numbers? They’re connected, you can't separate them. Where have you been? I was at Senyinge’s, treating my cut. Please! Did that really take all day? I passed by the school. To write down what they'd written. Finish hanging the clothes I have other chores to do. Okay. I see father has guests today. Can I see that hand? What did Senyinge say? She's fine. She says it’s been too long. But mother, you should go visit Senyinge. Even if it’s just to get out of the house or even off the farm. I don't take my problems to others Neema. And neither should you. Okay. How many times have I told you? If you want something to be done, it's fine. But you have to start it on your own. Don’t depend on others to help you. Fatuma! We need more drinking water. These folks that are… Neema. You’re back? I’m back. Good, very good. Why are you so untidy my child? Wipe yourself up dear. There are people who've come to meet you. -Me? -Yes. Let’s go. Gentlemen! Here is my daughter. Neema, darling, please say hello to Mr Mbao. I know you don’t need one who's too educated. But she’s the top math student in her class though. Where did you find them? I didn’t find them. They know this is a good family. And who is this Cleopas? You met at the bar, right? What questions are they? Who do you think I am? Honestly, I don’t know who you are. Maybe at the bar they know you better. It was a very long day. Long, right? What do you think our daughter thinks of this arrangement? Fatuma… Neema is already a woman now. You see her yourself. So just because she has breasts, she must go and marry a fisherman? Who told you he’s a fisherman? He’s a farmer just like us. A farmer just like us? Remind me when was the last time you touched a hoe? Why are you going too far? You are shameful. She’s still too young and still in school. I don’t want a debate. Neema is a grown up and is ready to be a wife. She's still a child and still in school. That's enough! You have nothing but greed for money. Go, I'm used to it. What did you do to me? I told you, I know a lot. It’s delicious. I’m glad you like it. And it's why I gave you the thigh. -Manyusi… -Mmm hmm. I’ve been meaning to discuss something for a while. I want to go to school. What? I want to study hotel management. Now why do you want to study? I need a certificate to get a job. And for studies I need money. More money? I’ve looked into it. It’s a good school that's in Madunga. And it's the best. It looks expensive. Even for me? How many shillings? One million. I'll be right back. Manyusi! Manyusi… There’s no way I can find that much money. For a young man it’s a lot but not for someone with experience. Sheena! I have a wife and four kids. And every one of them is hungry. How can I get that kind of money? I can’t. You’re joking. You just want me as your side dish. You don’t respect me. Sheena, baby, what's up now? Let go of me! Wash your hands. Sheena, if I didn’t have a wife I promise-- Empty promises! I gave you my young body. You’re the air I breathe Sheena, please. Let go of me! Sheena I love you… Lies! You came into my house like a snake. Get out! Get out! Time is up. Put your pens down. Neema! What’s this? I’m sorry. How can I mark a paper that looks like something died on it? I’m very disappointed, Neema. It’s time for you to wake up. -Where are you going? -None of your business. That one over there. Hurry up, we could get caught. What are you doing? Danny, it’s the owner! Let’s get out of here. I got you today. Ali! It’s not funny you know. So I did that for nothing? Can’t you take a joke? You know Neema, your fate is always in your hands. So they can't force you to marry. You have a right to complete school. The guy came home to see me. Your fiancée? It’s not like that! You said it was like that. What’s he like? Old. Around 30 years old. -Handsome? -What? Like me? He’s not my type. If you had seen him. He's short. Like this. You know what, Neema? Don’t lose hope in your life. I have no say in my life. Other people are in control. Don't worry. What's wrong? I don’t want to cook and clean. Nor break my back trying to make ends meet. What do you want Neema? I don't know. I know what I want. What? You. -Isn't that Neema? -Shut up. What are you doing? It's my siblings. They saw me. They're going to tell on me. I have to go. Neema, wait. Hey you! What's that there? -We found them. -How? Who gives away fruits these days? I'm asking you. Stop! What riches have we got? Stolen goods. Delicious! Well done, boys. You’re encouraging these kids to steal? Fatuma! People don't care about a small thing like this. These are trivial matters. I work hard to feed my family everyday without depending on anyone. While you are amused by stealing other people's work, right? I think your mother has lost her sense of adventure. You know my sense of adventure very well. Everyday I provide meals and serve these children. Boys, this is how marriages are. A wife always wants to steal her husband's joy. Marriage is joyful? Have some fruit and relax. Excuse me from that! Marriage is the curse you want on our girl so she suffers like me! Shut up! She needs education to succeed and not marry a do-nothing like you. Shut up! Why do you have to put me down? Enough. It's over. Let us move on in peace. What can I help with, mom? Go and wash the baby. And when you're done get this fire going. Mother! Mother! What is it? Mom, I can't marry Cleopas. You will do as you are told. Do you hear? Go and wash the baby! Neema. Are you okay? Neema. I’m fine. I don’t need your help. Didn't you tell me not to burden others with my problems? Don’t ever talk to me like that. Don’t you dare. Neema, are you really alright? Leave me alone! I don’t need your help! ♪Women! Let's build the nation!♪ ♪Women! Let's build our nation!♪ ♪Our nation!♪ ♪Women!♪ ♪Let's build the nation!♪ -Fatuma! -Senyinge! It’s been too long. I’ve been meaning to come and see you but I’m so busy. Don't worry my friend. I've had a lot to do too. Congratulations to you though, I see how good your is. Thanks! Neema and I worked really hard. Neema’s a smart girl. You’re lucky! She’s resilient and a fighter. We met and talked a bit. It seems like… On her side… there's a problem. I think it's school issues. Senyinge, we all have our burdens to bear. Feeding my family is my responsibility and I need Neema’s help a lot. I wish I could do it without her, but I can’t. You don’t have to bear all of it alone. Could you come to a meeting? Do you mean a women’s group? Yes! Exactly that. It’s a good idea. Thank you. But right now I have nothing to offer. It shouldn't be an issue. In this valley there's no one with yields like yours. And all the villagers know that. And what about Manyusi? -What about him? -He understands nothing. I have to get going. But promise me you'll think about it. -I'm happy to see you my friend. -And you… Mama Hunye… give me the usual. Mr. Chongo! I see you’re early. I’m bringing them. Give me three. What are you looking for? What do you mean? I come here everyday. I thought you understood me. Sheena, stop that. What you’re doing isn’t good. You and I have a lot of good things. Good for you maybe. Listen! Things will get better for me soon. The hardships are passing by. We're waiting for the harvest. Those are just excuses. Sheena, please. You're like a princess to me. You never had a time like the one you had with me. Come here! Who’s that jerk? He’s a paying customer, unlike you. Sheena. Wait. Sheena. You’re my light. I need you. I want to help you. For real. There are so many men on earth. If you can’t invest in me then I can't invest in you. Do you need anything gentlemen? Neema dear, come here. Help me solve this problem. Look here. There's six of these and each costs 420,000. How much is it for all six of them? -420,000? -Yes. It’s two and a half million. Two and a half million? What are you so happy about? The value of their promise. Whose promise? The Mbaos. Their offer for Neema’s bride price. Two and a half million, we're sorted. I told them six cows. Six cows? You just want fast cash. This is the moment, Fatuma! Everyone will know how much we get. Manyusi, you know she's still a child. She is the same age that you were when we got married. You know she's the one who helps me with work at home. Who used to help you before we had her? Bye father, bye mother. See you! -What do you want? -Sheena! I think it’s time to work things out. It’ll be a victory for you and me. What do you think? So you'll pay my fees? You deserve a good education. And I deserve you. What’s up, Sheena? Too many words destroy action. Sheena! I’m just straightening a few details. I’ll have that money in a few days. And you'll go to school. I’ll be waiting. You know where to find me. They're healthy. How's your morning, ladies? Fine, thanks! -Welcome. -Thank you. -I'll come later. -Okay. -How are you? -Not bad. -Welcome. -Thank you. Fatuma! Welcome! Thanks. What’s up? Worms have infested my crop for the past two days. I’m worried I will lose it all. I just need enough money to pay for the spraying. Okay. Let’s see how we can help you. Welcome. I want to introduce you to the women. Okay? Ladies please! Ladies! Our good friend Fatuma is in trouble. She needs cash. But we all know Fatuma has good crops. And we know its worth. I have a suggestion. All our contributions go to her. Once she’s sold her first crop, she’ll pay us back. But pests are a problem for all of us. Why should we give our hard-earned savings to someone who can’t even contribute? Ladies, don't forget why we are here. We’re a savings club. Mama Prisca. Do you remember when you first joined this group? Your child was in severe pain. You came and the group gave you a loan. And as a result, your son is now healthy. My fellow women! Please forgive me. I know we’re all struggling so I don’t want to be a burden to you. No, Fatuma. Wait. Fatuma has come to us when in trouble. Let's congratulate her first. That’s true. Also, having a skillful farmer like her will add great value to our group. What do you say? All of you there? Okay. Let's help our friend, right? Give it to her. Fatuma, congratulations. Neema. Is everything alright? I’ve got so much catching up to do. Do you mind if I stay on a while? I’ve been reviewing your overall marks. Unfortunately, it’s not looking good . I've wanted to speak about it for a while but I had no chance. The examination board prohibits failed students to advance. I can't advance? But madam, I was working on the farm when I was absent. Sorry Neema, but there is nothing I can do. You will need to pass in the final for you to be able to advance. Otherwise you won't advance and will have to retake the class. I’ll do whatever it takes. Have you spoken to your parents? I’ve tried, but… Okay. Work hard. I am done! No! It's true. I've failed my exams. Madam Rose said I must retake the class. Or quit! What happened? You were doing so well. I can’t stop my father from marrying me off. I’ll end up like my mother, working without payment, with a husband who doesn't care about me. It won't be like that even for a day Neema. There's no challenge without it's owner. Neema! Let's go to the city together. I have an uncle there who can help us. I can't abandon my family Ali. They abandoned you way back, Neema. Please, think about coming with me. I would love to, very much-- Then think about it. -Now, sir… -Yes. Let’s talk about this first. Which day specifically will it be final? There are things that must be done first before the cows are brought. -Do you understand? -Yes. We must follow the whole procedure as per traditions. Step by step. Then just give me money. -Money? -Yes. Just give me money instead of cattle. I’ve already done the math. Let’s keep up with the times my friend. I’ll take cash instead of cows. You know about the distant cane. Mr. Mbao won't be happy with this. Especially the cash suggestion. Let's follow the traditions. -Fatuma! -Yes. Some more liquor please. Listen, sir… Cash is the best way. It’s fast, easy and reliable. You know yours and I know mine. No! Brother, please listen to me. I’m stuck. I'm in a delicate situation. I really need money! And this is the last good solution. The solution is cows. And as we wait, your daughter will blossom. You get me? I just want to receive cash. No! Can I tell you something Mr. Manyusi? Let’s continue drinking as friends. Don't worry my friend. It’ll happen! That's for sure. You got rid of the pests before they destroyed your crop. How many sacks do you usually harvest in an acre? Around eight or nine. This time my friend, it's 15 sacks per acre. Don't get my hopes too high up. No, really. What do you think of combining your maize with the group's? Together we're stronger against the brokers. I’ll think about it. -Alright, goodbye. -Alright. How are you, Mr Kidevu? How can I help you? What do you need? I think you're the one who needs what's mine. -I'm selling my maize. -I don’t like small deals. I mean the whole harvest. I won’t take even a grain. You mean the whole field? Yes. Ok. Come. Yes. I'd like to see it. It may be worthless and I end up paying more than it's value. I assure you sir my field has big cobs. Around the valley, there's no field like it. Everyone is jealous. Okay, I’ll come see it after a while. But I think I saw your wife there. It's best if you come when she's not around. Come around in the evening. I’ll be waiting. Ok, I will come. I’ll come. How are you, my dear? Good. Okay. Do you see how we have good crops this season? Your hard work is evident. Congrats. And it pays too. Before I forget, Senyinge was here today. Why? I just want to prepare to sell. You’re counting your chicks even before the chicken lays the eggs. No, it's just that she thinks I will harvest more this season. What does that mean? We might harvest 15 sacks per acre or even more if we’re lucky. I was just leaving actually. Let's go. You go ahead. I want to enjoy the view here for a while. The field looks really good. -Okay, I’ll go ahead then. -Okay. Hey, you don't have to make so much noise! How are you, Manyusi? I’m fine. Do you want everyone to know? You see the product? It's not good enough. We can harvest 25 sacks per acre. Who told you so? The experts told me. I am an expert. The most you can get here is 25 sacks. That's it. Not more. No Kidevu, maybe double that. This is nonsense. You’re fooling yourself. I don’t think I would even turn a profit. Wait! How much will you pay? It’s the best phone I've ever had. -How much will you pay? -This is it. For what? For that. The whole farm. That's not an offer. I need cash. I told you I'd just waste my time. Wait! Do you want me to kill you? No but you want to kill me with what you're offering me Move! Kidevu, help me. I'm in need of money. Please help me. Listen, this is how it is. I’ll give you this phone. But I don’t want a phone. Everyone needs a phone Manyusi. And if you use it right, it can make you money. What do you mean? Let's not waste time. Wait, please wait. How much? Okay, I will give you one million and this phone. I'll take a large portion of it. Make it two million. We can't go on discussing the price. That's the last price. Do you want it or not? Okay? That phone is in good condition. There might also be some cheeky stuff in there . Fine, give me the money. All the food is spilled. Neema, can I have my ball? I'm not giving it to you. -Neema, give me my ball. -No. No way. Hey children, stop it! Mum I've remembered something. Neema has failed her exams. The teacher said she'll be expelled. Is it true? Is this true, Neema? Madam Rose said I'll retake the year. For failing just one exam? Mum, my grades are getting worse. But you always top your class Neema. How can I do all this work alone? Work in the field, work at school and still work at home. These two dimwits should be working while I go to school. Go finish cooking. Maybe it's easier for all to sell me off to cook for Cleopas! Neema… You know very well I can’t sell you off. But you're doing nothing to stop this. Neema, this issue is complicated. Maybe one day you’ll understand. If I don't get it now, I pray to God that I never understand it! Your husband is back and you just stir up issues. Neema! Come! Why are you here at this time? I came to tell you I’m leaving! Leaving? What do you mean? I’ve decided to go to the city. I’m leaving on Wednesday. No, you can't leave me here all alone. I won't leave you here, Neema. I want you to come with me. Are you sure this is what you want? I’ve never wanted anything more than this. But I'm scared. Don’t be. You are brave. And the city isn’t far at all. You can return when you want. Neema, goodnight. These sacks preserve maize for longer. There is no wastage. And it helps to dry out the maize. I’m afraid because I’m made at fault. I want to introduce you to someone. Let’s go. This man uses his mobile phone to get the latest price for all produce. How many sacks do you expect to harvest this season? I expect around 45 sacks. 45? The recommended farm price is 70,000 shillings. But if you are selling with the group, I can do 75,000 shillings. 45 sacks… You will get three million three hundred thousand and seventy five . Thanks a lot, my friend. All the work was thanks to you. Thank you. Let’s go. Check her out, bro! We expect to start classes for the new term next Tuesday. I hope you had a chance to look around the school? No I haven't but I'd really love to. As i receive your fees and sort everything out I'll look for… Cuthbert! This is Sheena. Please show her around the school. Okay, no problem. -Welcome Sheena. -Thank you. -So you’ll be joining us? -Yes. So from Monday you'll be with us. Don't worry. Your daughter is in safe hands. Get in, let’s go. Let me stay here today. What do you mean? I have a lot to do before classes begin. I don't understand. Don't worry Manyusi. I’ll let you know when I get back. Sheena! I paid your fees so you leave me? No. It's not the end, Manyusi. Think of it as an investment. My dear, where have you been all day? Is that meat? Yes! We’re celebrating tonight. With meat? How can we afford it? What's the party about? The harvest. A bright future. But we have not yet harvested Fatuma. Mother, isn't that meat I'm smelling? Yes, my dear! Please call your siblings and bring the plates. Food is ready. Baraka! Baba Neema, are you alright today? What happened? It doesn't concern you. Can you please tell me what the party is about? I met a distributor who is offering 75,000 per sack! And Senyinge thinks that we can harvest 45 sacks this season! What does that mean? My dear, we will get more than three million this season. Why am I smelling meat? Mother, did you cook meat today? Wow, meat! Baba Neema, eat! Are you sure you're okay today? Yes, I'm fine. Aren’t you happy? This is more money than we've ever gotten. I’m just a bit stunned. How comes you looked for distributors this time? So that shocked you? That's my responsibility. Let me get this straight. I work the land everyday of the month and then you negotiate the price and decide how the money is spent, right? What do you want to do with that money Manyusi? What's up with you tonight? I don’t understand you. I'm just wondering why this isn’t good news to you. It's good news, really good. With this money we can feed our family, pay bills and buy farm supplies. And we'll still have one million to save for the future. And Neema can go on and complete her studies as well. Who do you think you are to make decisions as if you're the head of this family? I'm your wife and mother to your children. And you depend on me Manyusi. Remember I paid dowry to your father. What did you say? Manyusi what did you say to me? You bought me? For how much? Six cows? Listen to me, I am not your slave. For your information, I am not your slave. What kind of man are you? What more should I do to please you? Baba Neema! Eat my children. This is what I was thinking about. My daughter I don't want you to live such a life. I know you understand me so you'll have to work hard. What's that? Is it a bird? It's coming from inside. -It's a phone. -Whose? I don't know. Should I answer it? Yes, answer it. Hello! Dad isn't around. I'll tell him when he comes. Who was that? -Kidevu! -Kidevu? What did he say? I should tell dad he’ll be here tomorrow. Mother! Is everything okay? Your father still hasn’t come back. I'm sure he's fine. Nothing has happened to him. Leave it. That's not right. Where are you going? I’m going to the market. Mother! Neema, are you alright? I'm fine. I wanted to tell you I love you. I love you too my love. Okay, let's go. So that's how it is. Expect everything to be fine and you'll be happy. Manyusi! I see you’ve already packed Sheena. Sheena who is this man? I'm a fool. Manyusi, let me explain. You thought you could take my money, run away and do whatever you like? Excuse me, sir. Shut up! Who are you, anyway? Sheena, I've invested in you. I've invested in you and I expect returns. -I can’t give you all that money and-- -Hey! Why are you touching her? Do you know her? You dare touch me. Do you know me? Get out of here! Are you okay? I'm going to kill you! Come on! What do you have to say? I’m going to hurt you. Come on! Dad! Dad, get up. Dad! Dad you’re awake! How are you feeling? Are you okay? Neema! What happened? Relax. Everything is okay. Keep resting, it’s okay. Where am I? We're in the hospital. Hospital? It's okay, everything is fine. Just rest. -Have some food. -Fatuma. It's delicious my child. ♪Calm down, calm down♪ ♪Calm down, calm down♪ ♪Silence father, relax♪ ♪When you cry you make me cry♪ ♪Calm down, calm down♪ -♪Calm down♪ -Neema! How are you? How are you able to do all of it? How can you be this brave my dear? Sometimes one has to be like that. But it’ll be good if we all help each other. That's true. Very true. Who has done this? Dad sold it to Kidevu. Come in. Speak. My husband made a deal with you. May I know the details? Does it concern you even a bit? You know it concerns me a lot Kidevu. My husband is the head of the family. Whatever we sow and reap is for the whole family. So I must know the decisions that concern my family. Then he should discuss with you and inform you of his decisions. I planted that maize in the field. With these hands and the help of my daughter Neema. Our hands brought about that harvest. Congratulations! Have you come for a gift? I've come for my rights. Everything was okay. We had an agreement. You gave him a phone? I do business with many people. How can I remember the details of a small deal? It’s over. Move on with your life. But we can't move on with our life Kidevu. We can't. My husband has sold everything. We don’t have food! We don't have money! And all for a phone as payment. A phone as payment for my hard work over a couple of months. Really? I gave him more than a phone. More than a phone? What else? Does it concern you? No! Your husband accepted my offer. It's his funeral now. You're right, it is a funeral. But it's not my husband's funeral, it's the whole family's. You and my husband have destroyed my family. I didn’t do that. Not at all. -Look! -What? Look! That’s the market price for maize today. Now what is this? You just barge in? We are here to help our sister. This is an ambush. You want to rob me. Kidevu you are a thief. We know the value of Fatuma's harvest. It was Manyusi’s harvest. It wasn’t Manyusi's. Manyusi did nothing to cater for it. The land might be his by law but I have the rights to the harvest. We all have a stake in Fatuma's harvest. We were going to sell together as a group. So what do you want? What I want is to be certain that my family will have food. That’s all. So I need six sacks to get me through the year. Six sacks? First of all, what you did is against the law. Kidevu, if you want we can take this to the authorities. Fine. ♪Let's build the nation♪ ♪Let's build the nation♪ How are you, Fatuma? Good. Are you still working my dear? -Can we talk? -I'm tired. Fatuma! Please forgive me for everything my love. I took you and all your hard work for granted. I have suppressed your talent. And with that, destroyed all hopes of our success. Fatuma! Truthfully from the bottom of my heart. You are everything to me. I swear to God. The family we have is my life. Without you all, I am dead Fatuma. Please forgive me. Give me a second chance. Forgive me my wife. If you've scored 15 you did very well. And If you've scored 18 and above, you did extremely well. Is there anyone who's scored above 18? Anyone who's scored above 18? I’m very impressed, Neema. Congratulations. Your work has paid off. Congratulations my dear! I don’t have to retake the class. Go inside. Hello elders? We are fine. How are you? We are fine. We are here to see Mr. Manyusi. Talk to me today. That’s it! What’s up now? Don't worry, relax. There is something wrong here. Forgive me for any misunderstanding between your family and my husband. My daughter is not for sale! It's become a scandal. Mr. Manyusi, what’s up? Why are you doing this to me? Listen for a minute, Fatuma is Neema’s mother. So I support her in everything she says. Furthermore, my girl is still too young. One day she'll be grown enough to make her own decisions. But not yet. So you've made your decision? Gentlemen, I'm sorry but I must ask you to leave. Leave! Let's go. Dad, mum, we’re off! -Bye! -Okay. Now, tell me. Do we start here? Yes, my dear. Okay, let's go.
