They're all the Devil's brew! You won't be able to hurt me! You won't be able to destroy me! Not one of your powers will remain on this earth! Light the fire! Throw all her things into the well and then seal it. You will no longer be able to help her. That and many other legends are linked to this medallion. Well, where did you find it? I have a hunch they're all lies. Whoever has a medallion like this is protected from all great evils. Bah! Is it really that good? The power of its energy has been completely drained by the black legends of the worshippers of the night. So. how much do you want for it? No. It is not for sale. No. no. Look. Nicasio. I'll give you 20 thousand pesos, and I promise to keep the secret. How "bout that? Much less for money. But listen. Nicasio, you and I... we have always been friends. We always make deals. Why not now? No. Well, what do you want? The little magic box. The what? The little magic box. That one over there. The one where you can hear the birds and the sound of the drums. The "little magic box.” This? Well then, it's a deal. No, not that way. Let's see. Take this off. Put them on. Hold the little box. There you go. Now put on your hat so they don't fall off. Then, press here, and that's it! What a guy! Would you like a taco? No thank you, Papa. You don't know what you're missing! Mama, Mama. We're not eating that stuff that father brought. No. my love. Don't worry, boys. I've made you some burgers. Let your crazy father eat whatever he wants. You have the weirdest taste in the world. I do. I married you. Who knows what I was thinking of. Is that so? Well, my love, I'm the best thing that could have happened to you. I don't know why you're complaining. Mine's without hot sauce. No, my love, I'm not complaining. I am really very happy. I have you, the twins, and Gabby, and very soon, our new baby. Chilcaltepec. Chilcal... what? Don't ever think that I'll let you give him that name. Look. you go deal with your pre-Hispanic culture, and I'll deal with finding names for my children. Don't be upset. We still have seven months to think about it. In the meantime, have an eye taco. Gosh, Fernando. I don't know how you can eat that stuff! Well, I brought it because I wanted us to celebrate the purchase of our new vacation home. What? What are you talking about? Just like you heard it. We now own a beautiful vacation home. Oh, really? What did you buy it with? No, I didn't buy it. Do you remember, about six months ago, I received a notice that a distant aunt of mine had died? Yes. So what about it? She died intestate. Do you know what that means? Now, as it turns out, because of kinship, I own that house. And after all the legal procedures, the attorney has given me the keys. Here they are. Seriously? Seriously! We own a vacation home! So get ready. We'll go see it tomorrow. That's cool! That's so cool! Boys! Come finish your food! Didn't you hear me? Come finish your food! Let them be. They're excited. What do you want? Let's play He-Man. No. Papa. Papa, What's the matter, sweetheart? They took my doll. Tell them to give it back. But why? I didn't want to let them borrow it to play He-Man. Gabby, sweetheart, you come and sit down to eat. I'm going to tell my niece the good news. This? Paulina? What's the matter, Uncle Fernando? Nothing. dear. I want to talk to you. Gee, I'm sorry. I have to go. I'm really running late. I'm going to see Julio. He has a rehearsal. Oh, that's great that you're going to see him. I have a surprise for both of you. You are cordially invited to my new vacation home. Your new vacation home? You hadn't told me a thing. Of course. That's why it's a surprise. You'll be our guest. We will leave early in the morning. Well, I don't know. Julio has to rehearse tomorrow. That doesn't matter. Tell him to catch up with us after the rehearsal. I'll leave a little map for him. Okay. I'll tell him. - Bye. - Good luck! Well, here comes the best. Good imported wine, to celebrate my future success. You found a job? What's up with you, honey? You just want to make me work. No. no. no. Remember, I am dedicated to science... ...to the occult. So. what are we celebrating? That's more like it! My newest acquisition. What is that? It's a talisman. Christian priests used these to slaughter the heretics. Look, I'm in no mood to listen to your fabrications. You'd better go and rehearse, and see if you can find a job like that. So. you don't believe me? No, Julio. Look. sweetheart, there are thousands of legends about this. The story goes that in the presence of an evil force, a beam of light shines from within... ...and it lights up. Oh dear, Julio! - You don't think so? - No! There's more. Look. The Inquisitors hung them like this on witches and warlocks. That way they weakened them and wiped them out completely. I have an idea. Let's go tomorrow to my uncle's new vacation home. There you can do all your investigations. - Vacation home? - Yes. Where's that at? It's near Valle de Bravo. He'll make you a little map. Valle de Bravo. A cosmic place with good vibrations. A place where great events have taken place. The rocks! The trees! Avandaro! My love, do you know what that means? Yes, I do. It means that you urgently need a psychiatrist. Let's just drink to that. - Hey. - Yeah. Did you ever get to know that house well? Oh, yes. but that was a very long time ago, I was a child then. They took me there. I remember it vaguely. It was a very pretty house. It's a shame that I never went back. My aunt did not visit with the family. It's funny how fate works. Who could ever have told me that now that house... ...would now be ours? We have all our bags packed. We're also taking our toys. But we want to know if there's a TV over there. Don't worry, children, your father packs everything with him. You are just missing the parrot, honey. Better safe than sorry. You heard it, children. Let's go to sleep. We're leaving very early in the morning. Well, we're here already! Get down, everyone. Let's go! How do you like it? This is our new vacation home? Wow! It looks like a haunted house. A haunted house? Let's get the luggage. Everyone grab a bag. Hey. hey. hey. come back here! Children! Be careful! Let them be. Let them have fun. Well. Don't just stand there. Say something. What do you think? It's really pretty. What? It is horrendous! Don't be a pessimist. Remember, I'm an architect. I'll spruce it up a little bit. Leave the bags there. Let's go see the inside first. Okay? The last time I saw it, it was very nice. The hinges need some oiling. Oh, my God! This is all a shambles! No. It really isn't. There are some good things in here. These are very fine figures. See this mirror? Don't tell me you don't like it. Yeah. It's nice. Let's keep looking around. Okay? Well, at least there's a refrigerator. - Yeah. - But there's no power. There will be. Don't worry. There will be. Look at the kitchen. Roomy, isn't it? There's no stove. Don't worry about that. We should have stayed home for the weekend. Don't say that. Was I supposed to refuse it just because it doesn't have a stove? Besides, the children need the woods. Children! They're going to drive me crazy! It was Jaimito! Don't be upset, darling. It was an accident. I'll replace the glass in the morning. Don't play close to the house! Don't be so skeptical. You'll see how nice it looks when it's all cleaned up. Mama! Papal Mama, Papa, come quick! Mama, Papa, come quick! Mama! Papal - Pablito! - Papal Calm down. I'll get him. Calm down. It's okay! I'll get him down right away. What are you doing up there? The tree won't let me get down. That's nonsense! Get down! Careful Pablito, honey. are you okay? Don't ever climb up there again. Do you understand? Fernando, we must remove that branch. It's dangerous for the children. All right, all right. I'll take it down tomorrow. I'm so glad you came, Julio! Better say you're so glad I've made it! What's up with your uncle? "He'll leave you a little map.” What kind of little map is that? By the way, as a topographer, he'll starve to death. Where's the genius? Hey. stop it! He's my uncle. Yes, I know. He's your uncle. Searching for treasures? There's probably some here. Don't exaggerate things. Maybe you should write horror novels and perhaps you'd have good luck. Hey. that's not a bad idea. Let's see: performer, singer, carpenter, baker... All right. All right. I smell a ghost. Here's dinner. Mmm. it smells delicious ma'am! I hope you all like it. Since there's no power in this house, I don't even know what I cooked. Remember that this house has long since been abandoned. Give me some time to repair the electrical wiring. It's all beat up. By the way. how nice that you came, Julio. Will you give me a hand with that in the morning? Certainly. Don Fernando. You know I'm the best electrician! Pass the bread. Didn't I tell you? I'm the best! Why doesn't Gabby sleep with us? Because she is a girl and you are boys. She's different from you. She should have her own room. And why don't I have my own room? It bothers me to sleep with this one! You're a scaredy-cat. You'll come and crawl into my bed. It's not that! Are you done arguing? Go to sleep. We'll play in the morning. See that one over there? That's the Ursa Major. It's beautiful. Oh, look! That's the constellation Orion. That's the moon. Julio! No, my love. Beyond the moon. Further behind it. - That one? - Yes That's Venus. In antiquity it was regarded as a deity. Humans revered her like a goddess. Besides, it represented beauty. So much so? It was so for the Greeks. Well, that was for the Greeks. For now, you are more important. You're still carrying this junk? Just a minute. It's not junk. It's a relic, and historically very valuable. Well, then, the relic. with the relic. Your truck is also historically very valuable. Let's go to sleep. So early? Well, let's go. Well, little girl. Let's go to sleep. Put on your pajamas and go to sleep. Paulina, there's a woman next to the tree. Where? There's no one out there. Put on your pajamas and go to sleep. Put up curtain rods. Even out the floors. Buy paint. Let's go to sleep already. Wait, honey. Otherwise I won't finish, and I'll forget what I have to do. That was enough for today. We have to rest. Remember you promised me you'd take down that tree first thing in the morning. Yes, yes. don't worry about it. I'll do everything you want. Beelzebub. my lord! Prince of hell! Do not forsake your child! Not one of your powers will remain on this earth! Mama! Mama! Light the fire! Mama! No! Mama! Papal Mama! What's the matter, sweetheart? What's wrong. baby? What happened, sweetheart? It's okay now. It's over. It was just a bad dream. But it's over. Papa and Mama are here. I'll go get it! Gabby! What happened? Why are you shouting? Gabby fell. She fell? Are you okay, sweetheart? Don't move. No, Papa. What's wrong. Fernando? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I'm going in. Gabby! Sweetheart! Gabby? Gabby? Sweetheart! Come here! Where were you? Papa, look at the doll I found. Can I take her with me? Yes. Yes. Let's go. Quick. Your mother is worried. Give me the doll. Help me! Lift up your hands. Mama, there are lots of toys down there. What toys! What nonsense! Let's go children! Julio! Here, Julio! Be careful! You know what? This is not a well. It's a cave. And there are very strange objects down there. We'll have to investigate. What do you think? Does it need more salt? It is hot. Just a little bit. I think it's enough with this. Don't you? Mama, is dinner almost ready? My doll is hungry. Oh, honey, leave the doll alone, with so many beautiful toys. Give her to me. Gabby! Auntie, what's the matter? Uncle! What's the matter? What's wrong? My baby! What's wrong my love? - My baby! - Calm down! Calm down! I'll take you to the hospital. Well, pay close attention without wasting an instant. I need complete concentration. Let's see. Concentrate. Concentrate. That's almost it. I need a sip to concentrate. I don't think you guys are taking me seriously. Concentrate! Concentrate! Nah. man! How can I teach you to look for treasures like that? That's it! Help me. please! Open the door. What's wrong with her? What happened? She is sick! I'm taking her to the hospital. I don't know what's wrong. Don't you want me to come with you? No. You'd better stay and watch over the children. Well, I'll go in and get the food ready. Won't you help me, Gabby? Well, buddies, until the folks get back we'll go hunting for treasures. How 'bout it? Yes or no? Well, let's go. Let's find treasures! Do you want to see the doll that I found? Why are you hiding her? Because my mother doesn't like her. She says she's too ugly. That's why they fought. Well, I think she's a beautiful doll. Qugch! Your doll has a splinter or something. You should comb her hair. You know what? She says that Mother is going to die. No, Gabby. Dolls are good. They don't say bad things. You mother is fine. You'll see she'll be back soon. Hey. is Julio your boyfriend? Who wants to know? You or the doll? She does. Well, then. Yes. He is my boyfriend. And what do you want a boyfriend for? I don't like men. Well, except for my Papa. Well, I like Julio. Look. Here's a picture of him. Doesn't he look handsome? Oh, he looks like an idiot. That's what you say now. But you'll see in ten years. In the meantime, I'll go see if food is ready. You agree with me, right? He does look like an idiot. I think it's okay here. Come on! Don't lose your concentration. Be careful! That's it! Concentrate. Concentrate. Let's see. That's it. It looks good. It looks good. I think the treasure is here. What's wrong? It's okay. It's okay. We better get out of here. Let's go! I'm worried, doctor. Do you think it could be serious? It's very strange more than anything. Her symptoms are not normal for a two-month pregnancy. Dr. Sergio Castro. you're wanted in pediatrics. The convulsions are very strong. Is this her first pregnancy? No, Doctor. We have three children. This never happened before. Perhaps she overstrained herself? Not that I can think of. Nothing out of the normal. Then, I'll have to admit her to keep her under observation. Be patient. I want you to meet the rest of my dolls. I also want all of you to be good friends. They finally went to sleep. Poor dears. They got really scared. Well, so did I. But it was worth it. There was no way to calm them down. You're right. They're little devils. Hey. you know what? Your aunt and uncle have been gone over four hours, and they're not back. The door, Gabby! Open up! Gabby! Open the door! Gabby! Open up! Why did you do that? Look at your dolls! Why did you break them? I didn't do it. She did it. Look, Gabriella, stop the nonsense, and start fixing up your room. Besides, get yourself to bed, it is late already. She doesn't want to sleep here. I'm fed up with you! Enough, enough. Let's go. You see? You shouldn't misbehave. Hey. honey, I'm still hungry. Why don't you make me something? How "bout a sandwich? - That's great. A sandwich! - A sandwich. What happened? Just a sandwich, my love. - It's that-- - No. no, no. You see me strong, but I have to eat something. Ham. All toxins. This makes you fat. I. for one, will make myself a sandwich with lettuce, tomato. and carrots, which are purely nutritional. Besides, like they say, [inaudible] A little knife. Get the spread or mayonnaise, or whatever. And don't forget the bread. Where are the knives? The knives are not here. Do you have something to drink? Well, after a good taco and a fine cigarette. Let's go for it, my love! Here? What? This bed's comfortable! What would my aunt and uncle say? Don't worry, my love. If they come, we'll hear them. Oh, come on! What is it? You like the truck better? We have a bed now. my love. We have to treat our bodies kindly. Let's enjoy the luxury. Julio and Paulina are good. Don't hurt them. What is it? What's the matter? The room is bleeding. Julio. What? The room is bleeding? You're hallucinating! Let's go see. Let's go see. What is it? What bleeding? Bleeding? I'm bleeding. See? You were hallucinating. Julio, you have to go find my aunt and uncle. Calm down. They're probably on their way back. It's gotta be the fuses. Paulina! Boys, be careful coming down. Gabby. you come too. Children, come. Be careful. You too, Gabby. I don't know what's going on here, but I want to leave. Calm down. Look. I'll go to the truck and get a flashlight. Don't be long. Don't worry. I'll be right back. - I'm cold. - I'll get your jacket. Gabby. open the door! Gabby. boys! Open up! You all locked me up. You locked me up, Gabriella! She did it! She doesn't love you. She doesn't love your boyfriend either. I'm fed up already with your lies, and your damned doll. You two put on your jackets, and you give me that! Go on! Hurry up! Go on! Put on your jackets! Go to sleep and stay there! That goes for you too, Gabriella! Go on! Let's go! Pronto! Go! Quick! You're gonna stay there until your parents come back! Didn't I tell you to go to sleep? Julio must die. What's the matter with you, Gabby? She says we all must die. No one should have come to this place. It belongs to her. Let's me out of here, Gabby! Let's get out of here! What's the matter with you, Gabby? What's going on? What's going on, Gabby? No, Gabby. no! Let me go! Paulina. The children. What's happening? What's going on? Nobody would have figured it was a child. Shhh. calm down. Calm down. I'm here. Don't worry. Fernando, the children. They're fine. They're all alone, Fernando. No, they're not alone, my love. Remember? We left Julio and Paulina with them. Calm down... ...my love. Paulina! Take the children away! Take them! No! Fernando! The children! We must go for them! They're in a lot of danger! Calm down, my love. You're nervous. - We must go get them, Fernando. - It's okay, my love! I saw them! I see them. Fernando! You must go for them. Calm down. Calm down. I'll go get them if that's what you want. Calm down. Everything will be okay. I'll go get them. I'll be back as soon as possible. Damned beast! What's going on with these children? The medallion. It's our only hope! You must use it. Why did you do it? Why didn't you stop it? Why don't you swallow me too? Don't go. She won't let you go. No, Gabby! Please don't! You've made her upset, and she says she must punish you. She doesn't want to kill you yet. But don't upset her, or she will. Silly! She wants to play with you. Watch out! My God! She wants you to burn it. After my parents, then you! I will burn them. They must die! The medallion! it's our only hope! Don't do it, Gabby! Don't do it! My God! What is this? Help! Help! Open up! Help! Don't do it, damn you! Julio! Get out with the children! Go! Pablito is missing! Go! Don't worry! Uncle! Uncle! What is it? What's happening? - Where's Pablito? - Pablito's in there! Go! Find a safe place! Pablo! Son! Julio! Pablito! Son! Son! Son! Julio! Pablito! Son! Pablito! Here I am! Come! Let's go! Uncle! Son! Get out! Quick! Get out of there! Quick! Give him to me! Let him go! Let go of him! Jump! Jump! Uncle! Julio! Let him go! There's nothing we can do! Wait! Wait! Come. Come. Let's go. FOR SALE Come in. You've made a wonderful investment. Congratulations!
