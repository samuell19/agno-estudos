[high point intro music] [electronic noises] [MUSIC WILL NOTT, "WON'T GO BACK"] -So-- ANNA: Look, you don't worry, my angel. You did nothing wrong, all right? Come on. -See you tomorrow, Miss Sterling. Miss Sterling? -How would you feel about going away for a while? -With you? Oh, yeah, of course with me. -Like a holiday? -Yeah, like a holiday. [MUSIC WILL NOTT, "WON'T GO BACK"] DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, Camilla. -It's not your fault. DOCTOR: No, and you're going to be all right? -Yeah. Thank you. [sigh] You'd think you'd improve with time. It's more challenging playing myself. -Sorry to disappoint, Dad. -How is Camilla? Has she chucked you yet? -Not yet, Dad. -Check. Your move. -You OK? Don't have to go in. -No, no. Of course, we should. -Oh, I'm happy to go home. I'm, more than happy to go home. -You know that Barry is actually quite sweet? -Well, there we go. I mean, if anyone ever described me as sweet, I'd probably have to kill myself. -You're sweet. -Don't. That's not-- -But you are. -That's not a nice thing to sa-- uh, take that back. -No, you-- -I'll do it. -You're cuddly. -I'm going to do it. -You're warm. -Take it back. -You made waffles. -It's cocked, it's ready to go. There's a cock in your mouth? -I didn't say that. I'm bold, the point is, I'm bold, courageous. [doorbell ringing] -Camille. -Hello, Barry. -Hi. Mwah, mwah! Jack. -Hi. -Well, come on in. La grand mama awaits. Isn't she radiant? LUCY: I look like a blancmange. BARRY: A delicious blancmange. LUCY: Stop looking at me like you want to eat me. It's creepy. Hello, sweetheart. -Hello. -Jack, how are you? -I'm good, thanks. How are you? LUCY: Oh, fat. -Well, sexy. Barry, darling, why don't you go and check on the lamb? Give us girls a moment to catch up. And bring some biscuits, lots of biscuits. -Of course, my love. Jack, shall we? -I'm so sorry. It's Barry. He just won't leave me alone. -Really? -(WHISPERING) I think he might have a pregnancy fetish. I kind of liked it at first, but it's exhausting. Like having a randy puppy around constantly rubbing himself up against my legs. -The thing is, because you're basically doing it in sauna, not only is it about three times more effective than regular yoga, but because you're sweating so much, you're cleansing your skin. And I get to do it all the time because I'm working from home. -Yeah, no, Camilla was saying that, um, you're designing a hospital or something. -Yeah, orphanage. Yeah, yeah, in, uh, El Salvador. -Wow, that's amazing. -Yeah, I guess I'm just lucky to have a job that I enjoy. Being able to help the infrastructure of undeveloped areas is just a perk. [clunk] [sigh] So what about you? You were an animator and now in IT? -Yeah, and I've stopped doing that. I am basically in a business with a friend. Like, uh, run our own company and stuff. -Oh, wow. What do you do? -Uh, we basically buy old slot machines, vintage arcade games, stuff like that. I fix them and then we rent or sell them, depending. It's great. It's called Slots and Games. It's-- -Right. -It's good. -Like a biscuit? -Yeah, great. Thanks. -Poor thing. -Well, the doctor said that although I still ovulate, there's-- there's no chance that-- I have an inhospitable womb. Although, I do hate that phrase, inhospitable. My womb, it does want to have a baby. It's just it's-- it's not inhospitable, it's just shit. [sigh] I don't know. -Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I must be the last person you want to see. -Don't be silly. I can live vicariously through you. [whirring] -Sorry. -So you guys, uh, been together for nine years? -Yeah, well, almost. -Wow. No proposal? -No, there's no point in rushing. -Oh, I don't think anyone's going to accuse you of rushing. Ha, ha. Oh, be careful. Think of Beyonce. If you liked it-- -Then you should put a ring on it. -Mm, mm. -Yeah. -She's a great girl, Camille. JACK: Yes. -You knew I dated her for a little, right? -No. I didn't know that. -Oh. Silly me. Well, don't worry, nothing serious. She's much better off with you. Uh, she introduced me to Lucy. -Yeah, oh, you must be very excited. -Yeah, yeah. I'm thrilled. The only drawback is she's not quite so interested in the old, um-- [whistle] Ha, ha. But when we do, she finds it most comfortable from behind, doggie-style. So that's a bonus. -Yeah. [alarm beeps] [urinating] CAMILLA: I still can't believe you pee sitting down. JACK: It's more comfortable. CAMILLA: It's such a waste. -You never told me you used to go out with Barry. CAMILLA: I didn't go out with-- oh, only a couple of times. He wasn't really my type. -How many is a couple? CAMILLA: Mm, two or three. -Did you shag him? [toilet flushes] -Can I still make you jealous? -Did you shag him? -Yeah. I rode him like Seabiscuit. Barry is a man of hidden animalistic passion. I mean, it's-- it's really, really hidden. But when you find it, wowzer! Hm, hm. Oh! Don't sulk. -I'm fine. -I had a hard, too, you know. -Sorry. How you feeling? -I'm OK. Now come on, let's get those pants off. Maybe a long shot, but I am ovulating. -Oh, and to think you used to seduce me. -Hm, hm. [deep breathing] -You all right? -Yeah, sorry. -That's OK. It's all right. It's OK. -Sorry. [sigh] MAN (ON RECORDING): There are three water signs-- Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Water signs are profoundly sensitive. But Cancer's modality is-- [huffing] ANNA: OK. All right, well, I've just come onto the M40 now. Yep. Yeah, say about an hour. Have you let the-- the key's under the mat? Great. Thank you. Bye. -You shouldn't use the phone in the car. -Naughty mommy. -Bad, naughty, naughty bad mommy. -Darling, we're here. Look. What do you think? -How long we staying here? -Well, I don't know. Why shouldn't we have a look? If you don't like it, we don't have to stay. Yeah? Mm. Oh, someone's getting very heavy. -I'm not. -You are. It's all those sandwiches. Mm. [bells ringing] JACK: That is lucky. You found one? -Laura, 21 from Nottingham, says, I can't help feeling the world would be happier if only everyone had a pet rabbit. Every time I hold Albert and strong his fluffy ears, it makes me want to make the world a better place. I want to make your world a better place, Laura from Nottingham. I thought you were meant to be looking for more stock? -Oh, it's not like we're straining to meet demands. -We should have some more of these motivational talks. -Have faith. We'll come good. -Right, well, in the meantime, I'm off. Got some big plans for tonight. -What plans? Uh, if it's a threesome with Camilla, I'm flattered, but I'd rather you just watched. -It's our anniversary. -Ah! I had an anniversary once. [gate clanging] -You look beautiful, gorgeous. -You look very dashing. -Oh, yeah? I can do a bit of dashing. -Did you rent it? -Yeah. -Yeah. -And I got dressed in the dark, you know? [laughing] -You all right? -Yeah, no-- I'm-- yeah. Do you remember when we first came down here? -Mm, hm. -To be close to my dad? Sorry about that. But you never complained, Mills. I noticed that, not once. You're amazing. You kinda turned my life around. I mean it. I was a mess before I met you. But you got me through it all. You kept me in the meetings, gave me something good. And I know I don't deserve you. -You do. -I don't. But, um, I-- um. [sigh] I had a whole speech planned, and I was going to do it after the meal. But, uh, it's a stand-in, obviously. I was thinking that maybe later you could go and choose one that you like. So will you marry me? [sigh] [crying] -Oh, god. I'm sorry. -Mills? -I'm really sorry. -You OK? -Oh! Yes. Of course I will, yes. [applause from patrons] I love you. -I love you, too. -Oh! ANNA: Well, that's a very taurine trait. They're known for their abundance of energy, especially sexually. Well, he is 15 years younger. [chuckles] Helen, I'm a psychic, I'm not a sex therapist. I don't know. Let me see if I can feel anything. [sigh] I'm just-- I'm just sensing it's a-- you shouldn't rush in too quickly. Yeah, there's-- there's-- I've got doubt around his reliability. Yeah. But fun. Yeah, and think of oranges and purples, they're all positive colors. OK. I'll call you in a few days. Bye. -Mm. What you doing? It's early. CAMILLA: It's really not that early. [chuckling] -You off to save the world? -Mm, yes. Mm. I love you. -I love you, too. Have a good day. -Splendid. [knocking] -Hi. Um, Jack Turner? -Yeah. -I'm Anna. We've met before. -I'm sorry. -Uh, it was about eight years ago. Um, in Manchester. at a I It was Primal Scream. -No, I don't-- sorry, I'm late for work, so-- -Well, um, you-- you gave me a-- your, um, your card. -What do you want? -Well, can I come in for a minute? I'm not going to rob you, promise. -Just for a minute. Come on. -Thank you. This is a nice place. JACK: Thanks. [sigh] -You've um, obviously done well for yourself. -Yeah, I do OK. Sorry, how can I help? -Are you, um, married? -Engaged, recently. -Congratulations. -Thanks. -Well, no kids then. -No, so why are you here? -But she'd like to, wouldn't she? -Excuse me? -But you don't, do you? -I take it you didn't come here to make small talk about my personal life. -No. This is my son, Phoenix. He's seven years, six months, and 12 days old. He was conceived just over eight years ago. Surprise. -Didn't we wear a condom? -So you do remember? -But how do you know he's mine? I mean, I don't exactly remember you being that hard to get into bed. -I know this isn't how you imagined your morning going. -So you don't know he's mine? He could be anyone's. -I have, um, a home paternity test. I mean, we can see a doctor if you'd like, but, um, it's 99.9% accurate. It takes three to five days, the postage is paid. And I've got two samples. One for me and one for Phoenix. They're fresh. Here's my, um, address and phone number. So if you could let me know the results. I've come a long way to tell you this face to face. -What do you want from me? -I want to know if you're the father of my son. So if you could let me know. I'm not going anywhere. I'll see myself out. [sigh] [sigh] -Half an hour late, sunshine. JACK: Sorry. -I'll dock your pay. What you up to last night? I had a less than mediocre wank. Then I cried. -I proposed to Camilla. -Fuck off! Seriously? Ha! I take it she said no. -She said yeah. -You lucky bastard. Congratulations. JACK: Thanks. [door closing] Hey. -Hey. -You all right? CAMILLA: Yeah. Mm, it smells good. -Spaghetti, it's nothing special. How was work? A long day? -Promise me you'll never ride a motorbike. We had another one in today. JACK: Mm. -He's all right, but it was touch and go. -Oh, sorry, darling. -I still walked around the whole day with a smile like this-- [chuckling] How was your day? -All right. CAMILLA: Did you ask him to be your best man? -Who, Paul? -I thought you might. -No, somehow, no. He's my sponsor and he's my boss. Imagine the speech that he'd give. -The thing about Jack is, he's just such a fucking prick. -Exactly. CAMILLA: Mm, I was thinking-- JACK: Oh, yeah? -We could have the wedding this winter. -Winter? That's quite soon. -But it would only be small, just 80 or 90. -How man is large? 200? -Well, Jessica and Timothy had 200 at their wedding. -Unlike Tim, I don't know the whole of Wales. -You all right? -Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Winter sounds good. Though, if you do want 80 guests, I hope to god you know more people than I do. [snickering] -Phoe, stop playing with them. Eat them. -How did the dinosaurs die? -How did they die? -Mm. -Well, some people think that a big meteor hit the earth and that killed them. -What's a meteor? Um, it's like a big rock. And it flows around in space. -Did it hurt them? -No. -But it killed them? -Well, um, when in hit the earth, it probably caused a big explosion. But it happened very quickly. So I don't think it hurt them. -Do you think a meteor might hit the earth now? -No, because that was millions of years ago. -But it might. -No, it won't, because nowadays we've got scientists. And they would know if there was a meteor coming. -If they can't stop it, then how would they stop it? -Well, they'd probably send astronauts into space and they'd blow it up before it arrives. -I'd like to be an astronaut. -Mm, hm. -Or a vet. I like animals. -And I'd like you to eat veg please. -Why aren't you eating? -Because I'm not hungry. PHOENIX: But still! -Pretty please? PHOENIX: Huh, OK, I will eat them. -Good boy. -Someone needs to call the police, because you're murdering the game of chess. -I have something to tell you. -I'm on tenterhooks. -I ask Camilla to marry me. She said yes. -Really? -You happy for me? -How you going to support her? -I have a job. -You fix fruities that no one wants. That's not a job, it's a hobby. I enjoy farting in public, but I don't go around trying to claim it's a profession. You need to grow up, son. If you're prepared to marry a woman, you need to make dame sure you earn a good enough wage to look after her. -Didn't help with Mom. -What was that? -Nothing. -Your mom ran out on us. I worked every day of my life to put food on the table. She left. She left both of us. You don't mention her to me, all right? -Sorry. -You go and pour me a drink. -Fuck me! Shire horse coming through! Ooh! [sigh] I've been drinking lots of water. Trying to flush the system of all that detox bullshit. But it just goes right through me. Whoo! I think I must have the bladder the size of an incontinent mouse. Whoo! That's better. Here, you should be at your desk, not lurking in the toilets like the ghost of George Michael. -George Michael isn't dead. -Really? You sure? -Yeah. -Ooh! Right, see you back there. [singing] -You're an-- an Aries, right? -No. -You not want to meet him? We don't have to tell him who you are, or-- we can take that slowly. Or if you're not up to this, then you can walk away, and I promise, we'll never bother you again. MAN (ON TV): This puffin managed to get a big fish when he-- [door opening] MAN (ON TV): landed in the wrong place and decided to-- -Um, this is Mummy's friend, Jack. -Hello, Phoenix. -Well, what do we do when we meet someone? Phoe? MAN (ON TV): The puffin is very important to the lives of the-- -Pleased to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too, Phoenix. -Uh, Mummy's going to go and make some tea. So will you look after Jack for a minute for me, please? MAN (ON TV): The puffin is the most common bird in Iceland, but unfortunately that might be changing. -Because I'm sure Jack would really like to watch some television with you, wouldn't you, Jack? -Yeah. I'd-- I'd like that. That would-- yeah, very much. MAN (ON TV): They're found all around the country. And their biggest colony is on the Westward Islands, where they breed on 15 islands. The sea birds are often long-lived and the puffin is no exception. They can live 30 years. On the Westward Islands, it mainly hunts sand deer. And it can-- -What are you watching? -The TV. -Right. MAN (ON TV): It often spends all winter at sea, and only comes ashore to breed. -Do you like puffins? MAN (ON TV): They're very loyal to their mates, and the male usually arrives before the female and starts to-- -Of course you do. Why else would we be watching this? MAN (ON TV): --time periods, and gives up and finds a new mate. But if the original mate appears later, he kicks the new female out and gets back together with his original mate. -There. Thank you. That-- that was really great. -I'm sorry, I'm not exactly Jerry Maguire. -Well, that is not a bad thing. -Phoenix, eh? That's an interesting name. -It means rebirth. -Does it? Oh, right. -Mm, hm. Maybe you would have preferred Jack Junior. -Ha! Look, Anna, I don't mean to be rude, but what exactly do you want from me? -We don't want anything. We came here because I think he's at an age when he should know who is dad is. -Why didn't you tell me before? I mean, that's seven years. -Honestly? At the time, I didn't think you'd be a good influence. Sorry. -You should have told me. -Have you told your wife? -She's my fiancee. That's my business. CAMILLA: Do you think I'm silly to care about all this stuff? Maybe we should just go to a beach and get married in flip-flops. I mean, honestly, creme or cream? They're exactly the same! Ha! What do you think? -Well, I've always dreamed of creme tablecloths for my wedding. [snickering] BARRY: And the way I do it, I'll have to get right up close. And in the right-hand corner, that's where the heater comes in. Mm. -So that's where you're going to benefit from my-- CAMILLA: Your skin does look amazing. -Does it? Thanks. Let me see. -Yeah, it's good. It's great. Mm. Oh, it's delish. -Well, it's that butcher, the new butcher. -Mm. Oh, my god. Like everything-- everything is organic. All of it. -Wow. -And if they don't have it, you just give Gordon a call and he'll deliver it the next day. CAMILLA: Oh, we haven't been. We should go. -Yeah. -Cam, have you got a date yet? -Oh, well, we were thinking about maybe December. [lucy gasps] -A winter wedding! -Stunning. -But it will just be really small. Just like 18 people. BARRY: Oh, very intimate. Hey, if you're looking for a soloist, I know this fantastic-- LUCY: [gasp] Oh, yes. - --tenor who has just opened the Glyndebourne season. -Oh, that would be amazing. Wouldn't that be amazing? -Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks, thank you. BARRY: Oh, no problem. Hey look, anything, anything you guys want, just give me a call, right? Any time. -Uh, not for me, thank you. -Oh, sorry. I forgot. LUCY: Have you picked a best man yet, Jack? -Not yet. -Well, Barry is something of an expert. What is it, four times? BARRY: Well, three and half, technically. I shared it that time with Charlie's brother in France, remember? Aha, ha, ha. -That was hilarious. Do you remember that? -I don't think I was invited. CAMILLA: Aw, that was hysterical! LUCY: Barry dressed up as a gendarme. -Oh, what's that? -And he-- -A what? A what? -A French policeman. CAMILLA: He ran around the wedding pretending to arrest people for crimes against the bride and groom. Do you remember when you tried to arrest the-- the bride's mother for sleeping with the groom? [others laughing] CAMILLA: And-- and she was like not laughing at all. BARRY: Nothing. Nothing. She did nothing. [laughing] Yeah, the mustache, and a-- and the baton, do you remember it? And I went, oop! JACK: It's not too bad, is it? -Well, um, it's out of the way, right? JACK: Do you want to go and play with the other kids? Or we could go play in the climbing frame if your want, you and me? -It's not safe. -Says who? -Mom. -Right. -From what I'm feeling, I get the sense that-- -I bet there are some things that you want to do that your Mom doesn't like. I used to get into trouble all the time as a kid. There was a time when I stole a bottle of my dad's whisky and drank about half of it. I had go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped. Nearly died. But I was fine. Don't ever do that, by the way. -Sometimes I play computer games. -Do you? I play computer games. Does your mom not like that? That can be our little secret. CAMILLA: It's delicious. JACK: Thanks, Mm. I've got some good news. -Go on. Dad called today, and he said that as their wedding gift, he and mom would like to pay for this new treatment. It's, um, it's like IVF, but it has these amazing results with conceptually challenged women. Anyway, it's-- it's hideously expensive, but they offered to cover the cost. And then we could start right after the wedding. -Wow. That's far too generous. -You're not pleased? -I am pleased. -What is it? -Nothing. -Sweetheart. -You know, it would just be-- just be nice to know that something around here was actually mine, you know? That's all. It wasn't a hand out. -What do you mean? -Well, this house, my car, and these pictures, these clothes-- well, not these clothes, but it's all paid for by you. And if we're going to have a child, it would be nice to know it's actually mine. -But it would be yours. -Paid for by your dad, which-- -But we can't afford it. -If you give me a little bit of time, then-- -But it's-- it's very easy for men to ask for time. -At least I do. Ask, you know? -What? -Well, it's just ever since, you know, the last time, I think you've always just assumed that I wanted a child. -Well-- well, don't you? -I'm not sure. -Well, I am sure. So if-- if you're not, then, um-- I re-- I really think we might-- we might have a problem. -No, of course, I do. I do. I do want one, at some point. It's just-- -Oh, you're scared. Well, but there's no need to be. You'll be a wonderful father. You don't give yourself enough credit. -You give me too much, Mills. -Well, that's what you do when you love someone. -Why are with me? -You're being silly. -Seriously. -Well, may-- maybe it's because you're kind. And-- and you're funny and you're loving. Or-- or maybe it's because you're a sex robot that's being sent from the future to give me more physical pleasure than any woman has ever experience. -It's because I'm funny, isn't it? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Oh, it's you. -Well, who were you expecting, Dad, Princess Di? How about we don't play chess, just this one time. -Well, why would we do that? -Because it's a nice day, Dad. We could go to the park. Let's have a sit down. -Who is that? -No one. [sigh] -Do you think I'd make a good father, Dad? -You're an alcoholic. -I've been sober for seven years. -People don't change. -I think they can. -Then you're wrong. -Am I a disappointment to you, Dad? -Let's carry on walking. -Everything OK? JACK: Yeah, just worrying about money a bit. I can't even afford to get Camilla a proper engagement ring. -I bet Camilla's got a lovely ring. -Are we wasting our time with all this? -Does that answer your question? -No. PAUL: Does this look like the gun of a man who wastes his time? One flash at us staring at the bar, and there would be a cacophony of chuff. Girls will quite literally lose their shit. -I'm being serious, Paul. -[sigh] Right. How did I afford to start this company? -You got five numbers on the lottery. -Five numbers and the bonus ball. What's that tell you? -That you gamble. -That I'm good looking, and lucky. -It was one of the smallest prizes ever to be won by five numbers and the bonus ball. -Yeah, even so, it will all work out. In fact, I got an email about some arcades down at Southsea. Are you about to go and check them out on Friday? -Yeah. -See. Business is booming Jack, my small-cocked friend. Now get back to work. -I bet they've had some good usage. -Just a bit. Hm. -They're beautiful. -It's as old as I am, that one. Of course, I'm in my absolute prime. -Well, of course. ANNA: Uh. MAN: You're going to look after them, I hope. -Yeah, promise. They're great. [clunk] -I'll have someone come pick them up next week. ANNA: So where did you learn to fix those horrid machines? A bit of a random skill. -I've always loved games. They're amazing. Used to work in an arcade for a bit. Picked up all kinds of stuff along the way, when I wasn't smoking and getting pissed around the back. -Uh! -Sorry. Sorry, little man. -What other skills do you have? -Hoovering. [chuckles] -Pretty good-- pretty good at Hoovering. -Yeah, wow! That's really-- -If you need me to Hoover-- -- --time well spent. That's great. -Thanks. I could always rig up sound systems as well. I was pretty good at that. -I used to do that. -Shut up. -I did. I used to hang around with bands, you know. Guys that thought they were going to be the next Oasis. -Groupie. You mean you were a groupie? -No. -What's a groupie? -It's, um, someone who likes music. -I like music. I'm a groupie. -No, because groupies like the musicians more than they like the actual music. And they travel around with them and help them a lot. -Did you help quite a bit? What? -I want to be a groupie. -Mommy is not a groupie! And you want to be a vet, don't you, sweetheart? -Or a groupie. -I think vet. I think you would be good as a vet, Phoenix. -I need the loo. Will you watch him for a minute? -Yeah, of course. -Do you need to go? All right. -So, Phoenix. -Yep. -There's a Phoenix in "Harry Potter," isn't there? -Never heard that before. -Right. -Are you my mom's boyfriend? -No. Just friends. -Do you love her? -No. -Why not? -Because I don't. I like her a lot, but I'm not in love with her. It's different. It's like you like chocolate. You're not in love with chocolate. -I do love chocolate. -Of course, you do. It's a bad example. -Are you going to be my dad? -Would you like me to be? ANNA: Uh, come on, boys. We going to hit those rides, or what? -Come on! Yeah! ANNA: I'll race you, I'll race you. [MUSIC FIONN REGAN, "BE GOOD OR BE GONE"] ANNA: Oh, careful. JACK: Not going to make it. It's not going to make it. -Oh! -You're turn. [phone ringing] -OK, then. -Sorry. -Let's try this one. -Sally? Hello. Um, will you take my turn? I'm sorry about that. Um, no that's not usually the-- the-- the case, is it? Um, just calm down a minute. I can't really understand what you're say-- -I've got a bad feeling about this. -Oh. -Ready? ANNA: Well, I don't think that's really very fair. -OK. -Oh! ANNA: Well, I'm really sorry about that. -Oh, which one should I use? ANNA: I don't think that there's a-- I think-- -I think this one. [crash] -Oh! ANNA: Hold on, I'm really sorry. -Do you want another game? PHOENIX: Yeah. Sure. -I'll tell you what. I'm going to go through the kitchen and get some water. Do you want some. PHOENIX: No, thank you. -All right, then. ANNA: All right, well I can't-- [sigh] -You OK? -Yeah. -Do you want me to make you a cup of tea? -No, no thanks. -Phoenix lost at Buckaroo. -Ah, did he? -Is everything all right with work? -[sigh] What do you think? -Can you really see things? -I found you, didn't I? -Yeah, although, you did have my business card. -Yeah. -I was thinking that maybe-- maybe we could tell him soon who I am. -Really? JACK: Yeah, definitely. I mean, can't keep him wrapped in a bottle all the time. You know, didn't the kids go back to school today? -Oh, I can teach him. -I think he'd be better off at school. -You've known him, what? Four weeks? Who do you think you are to come and tell me how to raise my kid? -But, um, I'm his dad. Really? You told Camilla yet? -No, but I will. -Will you? Because at the moment, I don't think you actually give a shit. I mean, have you told anyone yet? You hide us away like some dirty little secret. And then you come here pretending that he's your pride and joy. But who do you think you are? -I'm sorry. I-- I'm sorry. [crying] -Hey, I'll-- I'll tell her. I will. I'll tell her. -You were with her when you met me, weren't you? -You coming? It's ready. [door closing] JACK: Mills? Sweetheart? Mills? Oh, there you are. You OK? -You'll never guess who I saw today. -I have no idea. Who? Lucy or-- CAMILLA: Close. -Barry? -Um, Matthew. -Dr. Matthew? You all right? What's that? -It's, um, it's-- it's only six weeks. You can barely see it. -How? I don't understand. -The old-fashion way. [chuckling] But he did say, uh, we have to be very careful. Um, not too much excitement or-- or stress. JACK: No, of course. -B-because of what happened last time. He even joked that we should cancel the wedding. Ha. But, yeah, um, we're going to have a baby. Camille! [chuckling] BARRY: (SINGING) And you dream whatever you want you want to dream. Go to sleep my little buddy. One day you'll be whatever you want to be. Whatever you want to be. [cooing] LUCY: Oh. TIM: Must be your singing, Bare's. BARRY: As far as I remember, I always had chorus. TIM: As far as I remember, you used to blow Mr. Downer. -Tim! -What? -You're so crude. -He looks just like you. Sadly, I-- I think he might have Barry's nose. -Aw, he's so well behaved, so responsive. You know, psychologists believe there's a 2% intelligence swing, depending on how much stimulus they receive in the five months. -2% doesn't seem that much. -Well, I play classical music and read Shakespeare to him. Apparently water is a very good stimulus for them, as well, because it reminds them of being in the womb. Though I found Sebastian quite loves the aquarium. Have you been there often? -A few times. -Hm. Fascinating place. -Hm. -You never know what you're going to see. -Well, fish, probably. -Ha, ha. [baby fussing] -God, I can't believe that's going to be us! Hopefully. I was thinking something. -Hm? -We-- you know you said that you didn't want to have a best man? -Yeah. -Well, I thought, just to keep my parents happy, and, you know, for the tradition, that if you-- if you didn't trust Paul-- Mm, hm. -Maybe you could have Barry. -Barry? -Well, yeah, I mean, I know. He-- he can be a bit pleased with himself. -A bit? -He's one of my oldest friends. And he's very dependable. He'd do an amazing job. He's-- he's done it four times. -Maybe, but I'm not having Barry as my best man. CAMILLA: Why not? -Because he's a twat. Who has wallpaper like this? -It's called Appalachian Trail. -Hey, Baz. Do you want some milk in yours? Or-- -Uh, Mills, Lucy wants to show you the birthing photos. They're really beautiful. -Oh, OK. Ha. -I'll do this. -I was kidding, by the way. It's lovely. -It's OK. It's OK, we're different people, you and I. But I do think we should, um, try and get along. -Hm. -If nothing than our partners are very good friends, you know? -Yeah. -I'd like to hope I'm not a difficult man to spend time with. -No, you're not. -Besides, we might have more in common than you think. -Maybe. Hm! -Ha! Forgive my little ribbing before. Couldn't help myself. In the aquarium. About 5' 4", long dark hair, ass like Aphrodite. Had a little kid. -That was my cousin. -It's OK. I get it. We're-- we're men, you know. We're not-- we're not evolved to be with just one woman. It's a fact. Over 70% of undeveloped indigenous tribes revolve around the male leading a monogamous lifestyle. -Polygamous. -That's what I said. That's how we are. Uh, I've had indiscretions. Still do. Obviously family comes first, but there's no denying human nature. We are animals, after all. -It's really not like that. -Sure. Hm! And the little boy is not yours, is he? Oh. Ha, ha. Right. Well, um, that's a different kettle of fish, as they say. Oh, look at you. white as a sheet. Like I said, we're not so different after all. [game bells clanging] [door closing] -Jack, I've been thinking I might enroll you in a Mandarin course. Well, obviously, the way world is going, looks like the Chinese Empire is growing stronger and stronger. So I think it's an idea to try and infiltrate the Chinese market. And I saw this documentary a couple weeks ago autistic kid that learned Mandarin in two months. I'm next expecting you to learn it two months, but I was thinking three months? -Paul? -Aye? -I need to talk to you about something. -Fuck me? -Mm. -That's-- that's quite the predicament. What are you going to do? -I don't know. -What would you do? -I think you should have a pint. -Oh, come on. You're meant to be my sponsor. -Fair enough. Maybe I'll have one. -I'm being serious, Paul. PAUL: Seriously? -Yeah. -I can tell you what the steps are and how to apply them. Uh, I can assure you that despite all appearances, our business is destined for success. But-- in this, mate, I'm out of my depth. Maybe you can flee the country. -Camilla is pregnant. -It wasn't me. -Oh, god! [sigh] -Is she attractive? -Who? The mother of your elder child. -Anna? Yeah, she's fine, I suppose. I'm engaged. -Yeah. But I'm not. ANNA: Well, I-- I don't know if that's fair. I'd say, usually I'm pretty bang on, no? Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry, I don't do refunds. All right, well, I'm very sorry you feel that way. Bye bye. -And ta-da! Done! My special work. -Hm, hm. That's gorgeous, darling. -Oh, missed a spot. [buzzing and clanging] -Food for two. -What did I do to deserve such a caring man in my life? [wind blowing] [toys clattering] -Hm, uh-oh. MAN (ON TV): Go out and tell people that we're about to-- [cell phone beeping] MAN (ON TV): --about to have a climate with climate changes. And the second you make that pronouncement, it's always easy to go around the world and find-- -Who was that? -Just Paul. Just work stuff. MAN (ON TV): --and find damaging hurricanes and tornadoes and whatever. They're not linked to the builder. [knocking] -Hello. -Hi. Um, you must be, um, Camilla, yeah? -Yes. -Sorry, um, I know-- I know Jack. -Yes? -Um, yeah, I work him. Uh, something has come up at work. i thought I might drop by, see if he was in. -Well, he's-- he's out at the moment. Can I take a message? -No, it's all right. Um, do you know where he is? -Oh, well, he's-- he's just-- uh, he's seeing his dad. Uh, but he should be back soon. -Right. -D-- um, do you want to come in and wait? I can make you a cup of tea. -Uh, is that all right? Yeah, that would be lovely, thanks. I really am sorry for barging in like this. -Oh, don't worry. S-so, have-- have you and Jack worked together for long? -No, not really. -Um, what is it you do? -Oh, it's silly. I, um, rent-- I rent old arcade games, uh, for kid's parties and stuff. -Well, that sounds fun. -Yeah, I like it. CAMILLA: Well, that's good. -I like kids. -Me too. -You're expecting? [sigh] Did Jack tell you? -No, no, he didn't. -Oh, god, I'm not showing already, am I? -No, it's just the way, um, I've-- I've-- I've got a kid. -He honestly didn't tell you? -No, he definitely didn't. -Well, it's-- it's just that we're-- we're not telling anyone at the moment, because it's early days, and-- -Yeah. - --in case anything happens. -Of course. Um, well, I-- I hope you-- I hope you both stay healthy. -How old is your one? -He's seven. CAMILLA: Oh, well, that must keep you busy. -Yeah, but he's an angel. I'd do anything for him. -Of course. I-Is he at school round here? -No, um, we're-- we're moving him at the moment. CAMILLA: Oh, where to? -That's a question. Um, I don't know yet. -Oh, here he is. -Uh, hey. JACK: Hello. -Um, you've got a visitor. -Hello, Jack. -Hey. What are doing here? -I tried your phone several times, but you weren't answering. -I know, I've been having problems with it. CAMILLA: Well, um, I'll leave you to it. Um, it was nice to meet you. -Yeah, you too. And, um, really, good luck with the baby. -Thanks. -Oh, did you tell her? -No, she guessed. I'll just be in the kitchen. -All right, darling. -I'm going to go. Like I said, congratulations on the baby. Good luck to you both. -Anna, wait! Wait, I wanted to tell you. -But you didn't, did you? -No, I didn't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, let's go to the playground tomorrow and talk it all over properly. Please? MAN (ON TV): --organization of Iran, and the UN International Atomic Energy Agency-- -Is she gone? -Yeah. -Sorry about that. I don't know why she's coming around here. -Is she all right? -I think so, yes. I think she's, ah, problems at home, or something with her. -I didn't know you worked with any women. -No, I don't work with her. I-- she's at a different department. What are you doing? -Names. -Names? I like it. It's about time. -She was pretty. Well, you think everyone's pretty. You're pretty. -You're funny. -Prettier-- you're prettier. -Hm. CHILD: Mom! Mom! JACK: It's not a great day to come to the playground, is it? -I like it. -Fair enough. What's up? -Nothing. -Really? -I'm not allowed to tell you. -All right. It's top secret, is it? -We're going home. -Oh. -Do you think you could come with us? -Would you like that? PHOENIX: Yeah. You're funny. -You're funny. -No, you're funny. Stop it. -Why don't you go and play with those kids and I'll go and chat to your mom. -They won't want to play with me. -They will want to play with you. You're funny, remember? Trust me. You're angry with me. Camilla was pregnant when I met you. We had only been out actually once, and uh, I just had to clean myself up. I'd gone to a few meetings. And then she was pregnant, by accident. Her parents are Catholic, and so she wanted to keep it. I just got terrified. So I fell back into drinking and everything. And that was when I met you. And then a month later, Camilla miscarries. And uh, it was pretty bad, infections and stuff, and she almost didn't make it. Doctors said she'd never be able to have kids again. -And you were relieved. You're not going to tell her, are you? -Well, what were you expecting? I mean, knock on our front door, you and Phoenix coming in, we'd all just play happy families? -No, I expected you to be scared and to run away, but you didn't. -No, I didn't. -You knocked on our door, remember. I mean, granted a few afternoons a week to see you could keep your conscience clear. I mean, if you're honest with yourself, it's-- you wanted to keep us away from your perfect little life. And-- -My perfect life? - --play daddy. -I'd love to see it from where you are, because where I am, I've just about managed to mess up everything I've ever done. A big fucking failure. Look at that. ANNA: Phoenix be careful. Phoe? Phoenix! JACK: Phoenix! ANNA: Oh, god! PHOENIX: Mommy? JACK: Come on, come on! -Jack, will you please go a bit faster? -Just keep your hands tight on his head. Stem that blood flow. ANNA: I am. Talk to Mommy all the time, all right? JACK: Come on! -Michelle? ANNA: Will you slow down? I can't keep the pressure on. -And he's lost quite a bit of blood. -Follow me, straight away. -It's all right, baby. You're going to be-- -Straight in, straight in. And what's his name? ANNA: Phoenix. MICHELLE: OK, we're going to get him down straight away. JACK: He'll be all right. ANNA: It was my fault. -No, it's not. -It is. Is-- is he all right? -We've closed the head wound. He has lost a lot of blood, but he'll be absolutely fine. [sigh] CAMILLA: Uh, he'll need to sleep. We'll probably keep him in over night, but just as a precaution. -Uh, he might have some headaches over the next few weeks, but certainly no-- no permanent damage. -Thank you. -Mills. -Not now. I have a break in an hour. ANNA: Did you know she was going to be here? JACK: The only hospital in the area. -Thanks. CAMILLA: Michelle said she thought he might be your nephew, but I said you were an only child. He's your son, isn't he? So all this time-- you've been lying to me. JACK: No, not all this time. I only found out about him a few weeks ago. I wanted to tell you. -But what? -I was scared that you'd leave me. -Oh, well, that's all right, then. Who is she? She doesn't sell arcade games, does she? [sigh] Stupid Camilla. She'll believe anything. -I met her in Manchester. We had a one night stand. -Well, when? When? -About eight years ago. Just before you miscarried. -When I was pregnant. -I'm sorry. --[sigh] So all that time when you were so kind and you were so supportive, you were-- you were just feeling good? -Look, please don't get upset. -Don't get upset? Are you seriously telling me not to get upset? I have to get back to work. -Mills. -Get your stuff and get out of the house. I don't want to see you ever again. -Camilla! -What? Can we not just talk about it, or-- -Maybe we could have. [MUSIC FOREIGN FIELDS, "NAMES AND RACES"] [sobbing] PAUL: My first impression is shit. JACK: Thanks. PAUL: You potentially had two gorgeous women, and now one of them hates you because you impregnated her and lied to her. And the other one hates you because you impregnated her and lied to other people about her. And if nothing else, it is a beautiful symmetry. -Funny, Paul. -Yeah, I suppose not. Is the boy OK? -I think so. I'm going to go. -Right now? JACK: Yeah. -I thought you may want to stay and celebrate. -Celebrate what? PAUL: We just secured our first long-term client. The Fairy Company loved the vintage gaming idea. -That's great. I'll see you later. -You're the boss, aren't you? A wee advance from the contract. Let's see if you can buy yourself a smile, huh? [distant dog barking] [knocking] -Coming. Dad. -You look like crap. -Thanks. How did you even know I was here? JACK'S DAD: I need someone to help me pick up a new cooker tomorrow. You not answering your mobile, and I'm not on Facebook. So I rang your house, spoke to Camilla. -How is she? -She told me what happened, what you've done. -And? JACK'S DAD: And I thought I should come and see you, lend you my support, you know? Well, don't look so surprised. -I am surprised. -You are my son. A father should stand by his flesh and blood. -I've messed up, haven't I? -Maybe. -It's like I've spent the last seven years trying to be good, all for nothing. JACK'S DAD: It's tough out there. -Yeah. You disappointed? -No. We are what we are. But I thought this might cheer you up. -What? -It's your favorite, as I recall. -Is this a joke? -No. -I haven't had a drink in seven years. -And look where it's got you. -When you first came down here, I persuaded Camilla to come down here too, so we could be close to you. You haven't come over once. -Have a drink. -Why are you doing this? -To help. It's in your nature. You're your mother's son. Have a drink. -No. -You can tell yourself whatever you like, but people don't change. -No, you-- you don't change, Dad. -Don't you dare think you're better than me, because you're not. I worked every day of my life. I made something of it. And when that-- that bitch left, because she couldn't handle looking after you, I could have run, but I didn't. I fed you. I clothed you. I did my duty. Now what have you done with your life? Nothing. You sat in your little fairytale. You know nothing about real life. But I do-- I fucking do. No have a fucking drink. -No thanks, Dad. -Where are you going? -Sorry, Dad. You can show yourself out. Mills? Camilla? I no you're in there, darling. I can see your car on the drive. Please just come to the door, just for a second. I know-- I know you don't want to talk. I know you're angry, but-- I just want to talk to you. If you're listening, which I know that you are, I love you. I'm not going anywhere, Mills. [door opening] -I love you, too. -What are you doing here, Barry? -I thought I'd come around and check Camilla up. Bad luck about the accident. If only you'd had private health care. No, uh, I'm pretty sure she don't want to see you right now, mate. -Just let me into my own house, please, Barry. -It's not exactly your house, is it, Jackie? -Move out of the way. [door slamming] -Is he gone? -Afraid not. -Barry! -He forced me. Physically. -I don't want to see you. -I know. I messed up. I did something awful to you. And then to make matters worse, I lied about it. I was terrified, because you're everything to me, Mills. Everything. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Whatever you need me to do, I'll do. I love you. -I'm sorry, too. -Time-- time to go, I think, buddy. [sigh] At the end of the day, the lady just-- he knows, Barry. [music playing] PAUL: Morning, darling. Don't worry, I was gentle but firm. -I stayed here? -Aye, all night service. That's what you get when you call me. You know, I almost relapsed once. You feel like your world is falling apart, and that you're helpless. That you're not worth it. And you're scared shitless. In your case, I suspect you feel that you've lost Camilla, the only good thing you've ever done. Fucking bollocks! You're the one who got sober, not her. I mean, she may have helped you, but you did it. Mate, you've got friends who love you. You've got a job as a partner in a business that's just landed its first of many lucrative contracts. You've got a lovely little boy, maybe another on the way. You're a semi-attractive, able, relatively disease-free young man. Stop beating yourself up. I mean, you're not perfect, but that's all right, nobody is. Well, except for me. -Do you know, If I ever get married, I think I'd like you to be my best man. -I would hug you, but I'm not wearing any pants. And I've got quite a sizable erection. [laughing] [knocking] -Paul? -It's the phone, mate. Sounds urgent. -Hey. Is she all right? -Well, she collapsed this morning. An ambulance brought her in. She's up in oncology. -Oncology? Wh-- -You didn't know. -Know, know what? -She's got ovarian cancer. It's got pretty inconspicuous symptoms. Loss of weight, loss of appetite, constipation, abdominal pains. Our resident oncologist, um, Dr. Houseman, is with her. -Will she be all right? -I shouldn't be telling you all this, but I was the one who inspected her GP. She was diagnosed four months ago. And the cancer was very advanced and she refused treatment. -So-- -Well, Houseman said months. Maybe weeks. I'm sorry. ANNA: He has no feathers. Is it some kind of disease? I think humans can change their-- CAMILLA: Hi. PHOENIX: Hello, Jack. -Hello, mate. -Phoenix, I heard that you quite like strawberry ice cream. -Ooh. CAMILLA: Do you want to come and get some? -Of course, you can. CAMILLA: It's just over here. -Hello. -Hey. -How you doing? -Fine. I'm fantastic. -Are you? -I'm all right. I think Phoenix had more of a shock than I did. He, um, he's the one who had to call the ambulance. -He'll be all right. -Will he? -Yeah. -What's going happen to him? -I'm going to look after him. -Promise. -Promise. Hm, hm. -Wait, I'm going to get this now. You are a Pisces? -No. Gemini. Well, I'm on the brink, so probably more of a Cancer. Sorry. -That's all right. I'm a Cancer, ironically. -Why didn't you tell me? -What was I going to say? This is your son at seven years old. And by the way, I am dying. Come on, you'd have run a mile. -Now that's what every man wants to hear. ANNA: Hmm. -So why did you refuse treatment? -There's no point in it. It would only given me a few more months. And then I'd have to go through all the-- I don't want Phoenix to see that. It's really important. I want him to remember me as me. -Did you tell him? -What? That I'm dying, or you're his dad? -You busy? -How is she? -She's OK, I think. -Well, she's a brave woman. She must be in a lot of pain. How have you been? -I've been better. -Mills, I just want you to know that I'm here for you, every moment. Either as a friend or as a father. Whatever you need. -Is he staying with you? Phoenix? -I suppose so. I suppose I'll have to start looking for a place to live. -Well, you can stay at-- at-- at ours-- I mean, mine, until you-- you find something more suitable. There is always the guest room. -Thanks, Mills, but we'll be all right. [game beeping] ANNA: Phoe. -Hm? -Remember what we said. An hour a day. Come here, you. Oh, dear. Are you bored? -Mm, hm. -Mm, hm? -Mm, mm. -Are you really? [squeaking] -Yeah. -Hm. Hm. -I've got something to tell you. Because I've been telling you something that isn't quite true. Do you know what it is? About your dad. -I don't have one. -Yes, you do. You know who it might be? Your dad's Jack. -Really? -Yeah, really. -But how? -Well, because I didn't tell him about you, because I wanted to keep you all to myself. And now you know, and he knows. And he really wants to have lots and lots of fun with you. -I want to stay with you. -I know. I know you do. But we-- well, you can't stay in this boring old room all day, can you? Why, it was so boring, and Mommy is just-- Mommy is just very tired at the moment. So would you be a very, very brave boy and do something for Mommy? Would you go and stay with you daddy for a little bit? Just for me, please? Just for a while. Yeah? -OK. -Good boy. -Are we all going to live together? -Come here. Would you like that? I love you very, very much. -I love you too. -Ah, now where's that new book? Shall we get that book that-- that Daddy bought? -Yeah. -Let's do some reading. -I don't like it. Well, give it a chance. You haven't seen inside yet. Shall we go and have a look? -It's OK, I-- I guess. -Oh. -When is Mommy coming? -I'm not sure. Uh, well, it's just you and me, for now. If that's OK. What do you want to do? There's a big garden out in the back. We could go and have a look at it. Might even be room for a rabbit. -A real rabbit? -A real one. ANNA (VOICEOVER): Dear Phoenix, I'm no great writer, so I'm going to keep this simple. First of all, listen to your dad. It's not easy to be a mom or a dad, but he loves you very much, as do I. I love you so, so much. I love you so, so, so much. Having you has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I'm so sorry that I'm leaving you for now. I wish more than anything I could see you grow up and see what you become. But I know whatever you do, you're going to make this world a better place. I know you'll feel that I've gone, but I haven't really. The world can be a very tough place, and you might feel alone sometimes, but there's one thing I do know. And that's nothing really ever ends. It may change, and we might not feel it, or see it, but life will go on. Of that I am sure. So don't miss me, not too much, please, because I'll always be with you somehow. I know it will be hard. And I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. But will you try and be good, be a very good boy and make me proud? I do believe that good things will come to those who deserve them. And if I have one of hope for you, my darling, it's that you can be happy. You take pleasure in life and enjoy what you can. Be true, be proud, be fair, and never, ever, ever forget how much I loved you. Your Mom. PS, don't play too many computer games. [MUSIC NICK MULVEY, "ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE NOT YET"]
