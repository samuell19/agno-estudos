TOEI COMPANY PRESENTS 1945 For Hirono and a group of young men who had returned from the war, violence was an outlet for their rage as they confronted the chaos of defeat. With Yamamori as their leader, they formed a family in Kure City. Through Yamamori's craftiness and Hirono and his men's reckless battles, the family achieved total control in Kure. At the same time, internal frictions started in the family. Yamamori's tricks made things worse, drawing under bosses into the conflict and leading many of them to their death. Even Hirono left the family and broke off with him. In Hiroshima City, the Muraoka family had acquired immense power. Under Muraoka's leadership, a new, post war generation of violence was nurtured. In 1950, as the Korean War broke out...

Hirono was SHOZO HIRONO FUTURE BOSS OF HIRONO FAMILY serving time in the same prison for killing a yakuza named Doi. I'll kill 'em. I'll kill 'em! It's a little burnt, but at least it's food. Chew it well. You need it. Thanks. MARCH 21, 1952 YAMANAKAWAS PAROLED Lady. Would you... let me work here? We don't need a hand now. Ask elsewhere. I wanted to pay by working. I'm penniless. Will you take this instead? After you?ve cleaned your plate? Go ahead, get out. I'm no beggar. What a way to return my kindness! - Yasuko, leave him to us. - Keep out of it! Fool! Don?t you know she's Boss Muraoka's niece? Lousy watch! Why'd you do that? KATSUTOSHI OTOMO-FUTURE BOSS, GAMBLING BRANCH OF THE OTOMO FAMILY We belong to the Otomo family. Step outside. Bring him over here! You bastard! Drag him out here! That's enough, boys. He's a decent citizen. Kill me. If you don't, I'll kill all of you someday... because I'll never forget your faces! How dare you, you bastard! I'll kill you! Please stop! Out of my way! - Stop! - Let me go! It's the boss. Katsutoshi. Stupid old man! Let's go. Him and his punks! Check on him. Hurt bad? CHOJI OTOMO-CHAIRMAN, MERCHANT BRANCH OF THE OTOMO FAMILY TOSHIO KURAMITSU FUTURE SECOND CHAIRMAN KEISUKE NAKAHARA UNDERBOSS OF OTOMO FAMILY Mommy, can I go and play? Don't go too far. You asked for trouble. Uncle Muraoka. TSUNEO MURAOKA BOSS OF MURAOKA FAMILY HIROSHI MATSUNAGA, CAPTAIN OF YOUNGER MEMBERS OF MURAOKA FAMILY Otomo told me what happened. Is this the guy? How is he? The doc says his temperature won't go down for a few days. He has no family. If you keep him here with you, it'll cause a scandal. I'll send my men over to take him to my place. MURAOKA FAMILY We're ready. - Ready here too. - Game! SHOZO EDA UNDERBOSS OF THE MURAOKA FAMILY Sake here, please! Let's go. KUNIMATSU TAKANASHI MURAOKA'S SWORN BROTHER I'm glad you're better now. Sit down. Boss Muraoka is kind enough to be your legal guarantor. Tell me. You want to join us? Or do you want to be an upright citizen? Tell the truth. I, uh... I got to kill all the men who beat me at the black market. Let me join your ranks. Please. I like your spirit, but you can?t fight without my permission. Takanashi here is my sworn brother. Join his family temporarily. Thank you for your consideration. Your watch. I hear they broke it. Got another one? - No. - I see. Take it. Be a man. Lucky boy. That's an expensive Swiss watch. See how generous Boss Muraoka is? Here, bro. Yasuko! Let me rest in the hotel. I drank too much. Good evening. Thank you. You better get home. Your daughter'll be waiting. Sometimes I want to be alone, too. I'll go home after a little nap. Kiss me here. I saved your life, didn't I? Don?t you want to? How dare you! Don't! Be careful, Miyo. Go, Miyo! Mommy, come count! One... two... three! Bro! What is it? I'll tell you later. Don?t you know your place? Yasuko's husband is a Japanese war hero, enshrined in Yasukuni. Boss Muraoka found out and he's looking for you with a sword. What a fool! Skip town before he finds you. Take him to the station. His letter. Hurry or the boss will split you in two. Hurry up! IIZUKA, KYUSHU Yamanaka became a guest of the Takehara family in Iizuka, Kyushu. One year later... What does Boss Takehara want? He says he'll treat you to lunch here. Come in. Wada, of Wada Construction, swore to team up with me, but he'd already teamed up with Itsuki. I bet they?ll attack us, boss. But if we declare war on Wada, we'll have to fight Itsuki, too. For our honor, I'm ready to die. Sir, may I take you to your next destination? May I see Mr. Wada? That's me. Who are you? The police never could prove Yamanaka was the murderer, but his name was whispered with respect among yakuza. Soon, Muraoka forgave Yamanaka and let him formally join his family in Hiroshima, with Takanashi as his guardian, and Tokimori, KANICHI TOKIMORI Kageura's sworn brother, as observer. And with Kageura, TATSUJIRO KAGEURA the elder, as ceremony arranger. Soon thereafter, an incident broke out that threw Hiroshima into strife. The fuse was lit 1955-HIROSHIMAVELODROME when security for a newly built bicycle racetrack, was contracted to the Muraoka family. Who are you? Stop those bastards! What are you doing? Kill me. With pleasure. It's the police. MAKOTO NANRYOZAKA HIROSHIMAOFFICIAL Drunks just threw firecrackers. That's all. Leave them to us. Muraoka's men are here too! You did it before, didn?t you? We did nothing! You think we're blind? We saw you run away. - Stop it! - What? Who is he? He's Otomo's son's no-good friend. Otomo's? Katsutoshi. What happened, Asano? They're blaming me. They say I threw firecrackers! Oh, I get it. That's why you were kicked around? Who beat you? I'll kill them. What's that, asshole? Stop it. Don?t cause any more trouble. If you do it again, we won?t allow the Otomo family at the track. Shut up. What's this on your sleeve? Nothing would have happened if you had been on your toes. Don't blame us. So what? Blame yourselves. Wait, Katsutoshi. Muraoka is a director of the Bicycle Race Promotion Association. You must save his face. Is that so? How will you save our faces, then? Muraoka greased the palms of quite a few city assemblymen. That's how he got his position as director. He's not the only yakuza in Hiroshima! Get out of my face! What do you want? You think it over. Many of my men make their living by betting on races. If they can?t make their living, you won't be able to either. Remember that. I'll kill you! I asked you to guard the track to prevent trouble. I regret my decision. Whatever Katsutoshi might have said, he's a punk who's turned his back on his father's business. Just ignore him. We'll increase the security detail. EISUKE ISHIDA HIROSHIMA DEPUTYCHIEF Boss Muraoka. I'm speaking to you now as police chief. The age of violence is over. How about making Mr. Otomo a director? I'll quit if he becomes one. Muraoka and I have been sworn brothers since after the war. We opened the black market together, but he quit and left me to run it alone. Screw the market! Soon rationing will be over, and we'll go out of business. The racing business brings in one billion yen a year, and directors get 96 percent of that. They have lots of other sources of income, too. Don't let Muraoka line his pockets. He's a gambler. Racing is gambling, too. A merchant mustn't get involved. Gambler, indeed! The hotel Muraoka runs is a brothel. The Muraoka family gets rich selling pussy. Dad, merchant or gambler, don?t we all live to eat nice food and sleep with girls? We need money to do it. What's wrong with trying to make money? Do you think you'll be able to beat up Muraoka's men? Shut up. Scared of them? What a yellow-belly! Why should we bow to them and die from hunger? Hiroshima doesn't need two yakuza families. We've got to kill them before they get rich and powerful. Fool! It's no use talking to you. Just one thing. I'll let Kuramitsu be next chairman of the Otomo family. You aren?t my son anymore. All right. What I want is Hiroshima. Suit your fucking self! Place your bets. Place your bets. Stop it! Bastard! Matsunaga, what's the matter? You know the rules about gambling around here. I'll let you go this time. Just close this place up quietly and go. What's wrong with a gambler in a gambling den? Who's the gambler? Pop. Will you come here? Mr. Tokimori. Katsutoshi's going to be my successor. Shut up and beat it. He is? Does Boss Muraoka know about this? Who does he think he is? Underworld king? Tell him I've been a gambler longer than he has. I'm going to be your fellow gambler. Let's be good friends. The seven of us a are a kamikaze team. We'll die together! What's your target? This, of course. Katsutoshi. Sit down, pop. - We're in trouble. - What's wrong? It's an expulsion letter from Muraoka. What? Muraoka's circulating it. Kageura, my sworn brother has signed it, too. We can't do business in Hiroshima anymore. What are we gonna do? Katsutoshi! We'll expel them. Are you a man or what? Sit still! Again? Join us. No. Say yes or I'll expel you. You really have a bad habit of dragging everybody in. Is Yamanaka in? I told him to clean the john. Be patient. Lousy priest! I'll shoot him to death. Raid! Come out, Muraoka. Stop! Let's go! Let's fight, Muraoka! Boss! Come out of there! Get out of the way! Boss! Turn off the light! Die, Muraoka! Upstairs! My gun! Let me have it. Wait. Run quick. MARCH 16, 1955 THE FIRST BATTLE -2 DEAD, 8 INJURED KURE CITY Meanwhile, in Kure, after breaking off from Yamamori, Hirono had formed his own small family. KOICHI SHIMADA MEMBEROF HIRONO FAMILY How are you, Shozo? What is it? Would you do me a favor? Let our friend stay with you. Your friend? Who is it? You've heard what's going on in Hiroshima. It's Tokimori. He's seeking refuge from Muraoka. He's my husband's old friend. YOSHIO YAMAMORI BOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY IN KURE Yamamori's in trouble. Muraoka is his friend, too. Will you shelter Tokimori for a few days? Take the money as a reward. Don?t you need it? Mrs. Yamamori, I broke off with your husband. Whatever happened, he still likes you in his heart. He still hasn?t formally expelled you. I've got work to do. Shozo! We'll go to the butcher's for supper. - Got enough money? - Yes. Dogs around here aren?t well-behaved. They take us for dogcatchers. Wait! I won't let you getaway! You guys eat, too. Oh, no, we bought it for you. Go ahead, eat. The dog seems hungry, too. Come here. Here you go. He won?t touch it. What kind of meat did you buy? I'm sorry. It's to save money. I'll cut off my finger. You shithead! I'll go see Yamamori. What a way to treat your guest! This is a pigsty. We have to guard the scrap metal. Leave if you don't like it. Will you come, boss? Someone called Yamanaka is here. Yamanaka? Where is he? Couldn't bring him here. I took him to that diner. I'll kill him. Take him back to Yamamori's while I go talk to Yamanaka. Who's your visitor? Just do as we tell you and things will be fine. Chill out. It's been a long time. Are you all right? I've heard a lot about you. I've been fortunate. If this is about Tokimori, he's with me. I see. That's what you?re here for, right? Yamamori asked me to help him. Would you go back to Hiroshima? I won't get you into trouble. I'll wait until he's alone. I see. You can't go back to Hiroshima empty-handed? But I've got to carry out my duties. It's not wise for us to fight over Tokimori here. Let's do this. I'll talk him into going back to Hiroshima. Kill him there. I'll call you and let you know where he's settled. Mr. Muraoka was kind to me once. I won?t fail him. All right, then. I'll be counting on you. It's a deal. I'll change clothes at my girl's house, right nearby. Katsutoshi's got a pawnshop up the road. Go ahead and wait for me there. I'll wait here. Don?t worry, go ahead. Go. PAWN SHOP Where you goin'? To piss. A call for you from Mr. Yamamori in Kure. Hello? This is Hirono. Tokimori told me. What scheme made you get him out of Kure without telling me? What did Tokimori say? You plan to let Yamanaka kill Tokimori, don?t you? Fool! Tokimori knew you two had been friends since you were in prison. Yamanaka would never have left Kure without making a deal with you. I'm at the Muraoka family's. Tokimori wants me to apologize to Muraoka for him. Stop Katsutoshi from coming to Hiroshima somehow. Remember I paid you. I don?t care if you make a name for yourself in Hiroshima. Katsutoshi will find out what you?re doing. It's gonna rain blood in Kure. To prevent it, I planned to sacrifice only Tokimori. You two-timer! You Kure yakuza sure are clever! What is it? Cheat! I tapped the phone. Double-crosser! Give me a gun! Don't. I said give me a gun! Go quick. Idiot! Forward! You assholes! Wait! Stop the car! Stop. Your shoes! That fucking Tokimori! Got a gun? I'll kill him. Mr. Tokimori. It's me, Hirono. Everything's all settled. I'll put Mr. Yamamori's note under the door. Please read it. MARCH 23, 1955 KANICHI TOKIMORI DIED Hello. We were worried about you. Thanks. How are you? I heard all about it. I'm glad you're safe. Sit down. Boss Muraoka, I just killed Tokimori myself. Leave us now, will you? I had to do it for my honor. I'm ready to pay for it in anyway. When I was trying to settle it peacefully! You messed it up. Katsutoshi's gonna be furious! What?ll you do then? Take it back. You confuse money with honor! Mr. Yamamori! Don't blame him. Nothing can bring back Tokimori. Hirono, I'm glad you told me. We'll take care of our fight here. Make someone give himself up for the murder. I've assigned it to one of my men. I see. Have a drink. Thank you. KOICHI SHIMADA 12 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT FOR MURDER Muraoka, seeing that Katsutoshi Otomo had lost his last influential friend, proposed that his mediator, the elder Kageura, hold a reconciliation ceremony. Muraoka stipulated that he would give part of his interest in the track to Otomo's 2nd Chairman, Kuramitsu, but that in exchange, Katsutoshi must disband his family. After accepting the proposal, Katsutoshi had to escape from a police chase. But he didn't give up the idea of realizing his ambition. Thank you very much. You must be tired. How about going to Tokyo to have fun? No, thank you. I like Hiroshima. I see. Have you seen Yasuko since you've been back? No. Not even once. Is that so? Good evening. I invited him here, Yasuko. Come in. Uncle. Have a long talk about your future. I've looked after her like my own daughter. Make her happy. I'm sorry I didn?t even let you know my whereabouts. He was very angry and kicked me out. Got kicked out of the market, too. So I became a geisha. Boss! Don't embarrass me. She's so sweet. I wish I could be her father. I feel the same way. The problem is my husband's family. They don't want me remarrying. His family? He died as a member of the Kamikaze Corps. They think I'll disgrace his name if I remarry, unless I marry his brother. I don't like him. That's why I live here alone. Marriage doesn't matter. We love each other. You have to honor the memory of his death as a kamikaze. I wanted to join the kamikaze, too. Did you apply to join? No. I was too young. The boss wants me. What is it at this hour? I don't know. That night, Terada and two men had gathered in their hideout under Katsutoshi's orders. In accordance with their plan, they would take over the Otomo family by killing Kuramitsu, its new chairman, and fighting the Muraoka family again. Who is it? I'm sorry to bother you so late. I'm your neighbor. It's been a long time. Say your prayers. No! Please don't kill me! Yamanaka, please don't! APRIL 5, 1955-THREE MEMBERS OF KATSUTOSHI'S FAMILY DIED Yamanaka! SHOJI YAMANAKA LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR MURDER After thwarting Katsutoshi's plan, Muraoka practically took over the Otomo family by making Kuramitsu his sworn brother. Not only did he regain complete control over the races, but his syndicate was like a kingdom reigning over Hiroshima. But Katsutoshi took his revenge on Kageura, arbitrator of the ceremony. Die, Kageura! Move! Run, you idiot! APRIL 19, 1955 TATSUJIRO KAGEURA DIED MURDERON TRAIN MURDERERS SURRENDER MURDERERS' INTERVIEW Kageura, the arbitrator of the ceremony, was fawning over powerful Muraoka. So we punished him according to the yakuza code. Ryuichi Kamitani of the Otomo gambling family. Seiji Kunisada, of the same family. What are you going to do now? I got things to do yet. To keep fighting? It isn?t a private fight. In keeping with our duty as yakuza, we're fighting to keep out city assemblymen and policemen who have been bribed by Muraoka. Isn't money what you want? Shut up. Money can?t settle this conflict. Do you have the gun? I have it here. Step up. Strike a pose. Better? Why are you here? Boring story. My girl got involved with a man, so I slugged him. I won't be in here long. Has Muraoka come to see you since you got put away? No. I see. After you?ve been imprisoned for life risking your life for him? Why do you say that? I feel for you. Did you hear about Yasuko? What about her? Nothing. Never mind. Kunimatsu Takanashi. Shoji Yamanaka. What about Yasuko? Muraoka's sending her back home to make her marry her dead husband's brother. What? She's fighting him on it, but he won't listen. I hear the day of the wedding has already been set. How unreasonable you are, with the wedding date already set. Go back to Uehara's at once. They're here to meet you. I'll live my own life. You stay out of it! You idiot! Have you forgotten about Miyo? Think about your future. You told me to talk with him about our future. That was then. When do you think he'll be getting out? He's got a life sentence. You're going to wait that long? - I will. - Idiot! I No girl can wait for her man for more than three years. Believe me. Besides, you have Miyo. Ayakuza imprisoned for life! Can he be her father? Forget Yamanaka. He's as good as dead. All right? What happened? Take him to the infirmary! Escaped? Yamanaka broke out of prison? He was spitting up blood, so they took him to the city hospital. He escaped out a bathroom window. You really knew nothing? We wouldn't lie to you. Muraoka, the law is the law. Don?t try to shelter him, of all men, or we?ll have to search your place. I wonder why he... Bring Yasuko back from Uehara's. I'll explain to them later. He escaped prison to see Yasuko. Someone told him about her inside. Welcome back. Yamanaka's here, boss. Yamanaka. Idiot! What's the idea? You think you're safe here? You had a chance of being paroled after 20 years or so. I thought you were being a good prisoner. Why did you go and escape? Was there someone other than me... you had to see for yourself? Boss. Darling. Shoot me with this, boss. I thought you betrayed me. I thought you took her away from me. Takanashi told me that. So I came here to kill you. Now you realize it was a mistake? Kill me! I don't have to, now that you know the truth. Boss. Will you let me talk to him alone? Yamanaka, come with me. Come now. You were worried about Yasuko? You fool! You saw her for yourself. Listen, Yamanaka. Even if she were to remarry, you should be happy for her. That's what true love is. What do you think you can do for her in prison? You're just keeping her waiting. Among yakuza there's nothing worse than babysitting a woman who's waiting for her man. You're so selfish! Besides, you suspected the boss over her. Shame on you! Bro... I understand now. Time to grow up a little. After you see Yasuko, go back to prison at once. Within 24 hours, you'll be forgiven. Matsunaga. I can't bear to live in prison any longer. Let me fight and die. I want to kill Katsutoshi. Please. You're needed. What is it? Katsutoshi caught Iwashita. Katsutoshi? Did you fight? We ran across Katsutoshi and his men. - I ran away. - Idiot! Find Iwashita. Take care of him. Matsunaga. How is Yamanaka? He wants us to let him do a job. Yamanaka! - Get over here. - Please stop! Where's Yamanaka hiding? I really don't know. We'll lynch you instead of him. Go ahead and talk! Water! Give me water. I'll give you plenty of water. Go on, drink. Drink your fill. Ma. This is an excellent chance for target practice. Watch me now. Nice shot! You're great. You try. What are you doing? Let me shoot. Boss! Clumsy fool! Easy! They're here. ANOTHER BLOODY INCIDENT IN HIROSHIMA The incident became a target of public outrage. The police set up a command center to investigate it. What are you doing, you idiot? Hey, not so rough! MOTOMACHI IN HIROSHIMA AKA"THE A-BOMB SLUMS" It's time to attack the Muraokas. They've weakened. We better wait. Nabbed men will be paroled and getting out of jail then. The directors are going to hold a meeting at the track tomorrow. Let's dynamite them. Let's blow up Muraoka and his race track together! Good idea! Asano. Get guns. Come on. Come, Nakahara! Let's make plans. My gun! Nakahara! Kill him, Nakahara! Do something! Hold still! You're hurt bad. You need a real doc. We better make peace with the Muraoka family. Why, you! Matsunaga is my friend. Leave it to me. I won't let you lose face. Tell Asano to do nothing till we come back. Goddamn it! Stop the car. They're with the Muraoka family. Muraoka runs that joint. I'll shoot them. A little advance celebration. Bullets! Keep the engine running! Come out. How many are hurt? I'll take care of him. I'm sorry. Mr. Muraoka is busy. Will you come see him another time? I see. I haven't been this exhausted from a fight before. Tell Mr. Muraoka I'll come anytime he's free. All right. Where's Katsutoshi now? In the west. Is that so? I've called a car. Thanks. See you later. What the hell! Let me go! MAY 24, 1955 KEISUKE NAKAHARA DIED Let me go! What are you doing? Let me go! Dirty cops! Careful, he's got a gun! MAY 25, 1955 LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR KATSUTOSHI OTOMO Katsutoshi's arrest scattered the Otomo family and put an end to the rash of conflicts. After all the Muraoka family's enemies had been defeated, the police became their enemy. Yamanaka shot Katsutoshi, didn't he? Don?t claim you don't know! Capture him and ask him yourself. We know nothing. Liar! Muraoka. The prefecture police have ordered us to shoot him. Hand him over to us or we?ll have to hold you responsible and arrest you. How can you say that? Have you forgotten you asked for my help with the Koreans after we lost the war? Times have changed. Don't belittle the police. It's been a while. How have you been? I knew I needed to pay my respects to you. Come in. Welcome. Let me in. It's so big. What is it? It's my kamikaze plane. Wow! Let me see it. Stop it! Leave us alone. Listen, you're wanted by the police. You really shouldn't do this. Hurry and go to Tokyo. I'll ask my friend there to help you. Mr. Muraoka will make the arrangements. But I don't want to leave Hiroshima. Think of Yasuko, too. Wherever you are in Japan, you'll be happy if you're with her. I can?t take her and leave Boss Muraoka behind. I made an awful mistake about him. I have to make up for it. Is there a Yamanaka here? What is it? A call from Hiroshima. Who is it? Mr. Muraoka. You're in Kure? It's nothing special. Takanashi got out of prison on parole today. Takanashi? In prison, he told you about Yasuko. Did you believe his words? Or mine? Think it over. He's got a big mouth on him. Where is he now? I understand. What's the matter? Wait! MAY 29, 1955 KUNIMATSU TAKANASHI DIED Who is it? It's me. What's the matter? Give me water. What have you done? I killed Takanashi. Takanashi? You idiot! In prison, he told the truth. I sent her back to Uehara's. And I brought her back in a hurry when you escaped prison. Fool! Why didn?t you kill me? Wait, I'll take you to a safe place. Hey, you! Wait. Hello? Anybody home? No one's here. Let's go. Attention, all residents. An armed murderer is hiding in your area. Vacate your homes and follow police instructions. Evacuate immediately. Make way, please! Watch your step! Quick! MURAOKA FAMILYOFFICES Yasuko, where are you going? Yasuko! You have to do something for him! Calm down. We can do nothing now. Go and help him! He did everything on your orders. It's only right you take his place now, Uncle! Act like a man and give yourself up to the police. Fool! Don't get excited. You won't help him either? You're part of the same family, aren?t you? You've killed just like him. You're no better than him. You should give yourselves up! We can?t find him. Maybe he's run. Idiot! Search all the houses again till you find him. MAY 29, 1955 YAMANAKA KILLED HIMSELF JUNE 15, 1955 MEMORIAL SERVICE FORYAMANAKA Place your bets, please. Here you are. I was impressed with Yamanaka. He killed himself to avoid causing trouble for the Muraoka family. Muraoka really had a good man. The police were glad there was no shooting. He was a man among men. Yamanaka's name is still whispered as a legendary Hiroshima yakuza. But no one visits his grave now. He wasn't the only one sacrificed in the escalation of the struggles among the yakuza of Hiroshima. THE END
