Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** [door slams] [Terry] For God's sake, Carol, please. Can't... We've got all our money wrapped up in this... Carol... Please think again [Carol] This house is evil. [Terry] But what about our money? So what if we just moved in? I don't care. Get rid of it! [Carol] Where did all those photos come from? I didn't stab myself. I've had it with you. I'm terrified. [Terry] Give me another chance. Never. [Carol] Sell the bloody house! Hey, Terry. Hey, Terry! [floorboards creak] [creak] - [door slams] - [creak] [walking upstairs] [door handle] [crash] [curtain] [doorbell] Laura? [door knocking] [knock, knock] 'Right... Coming... [walking downstairs, opening door] [Peter] As you can see, the house is almost done. [Mr Blake] Can I take a look at the office? [Peter] How did you know it was an office? I used to live around here. It would be great to line up a buyer, Mr...? Mr Blake. You've done quite a bit... - erm... - Oh, Peter. Is there anything you can tell me about the garden? No... bodies in there then? [laughs] Well, er... Well you never know. That would be an extra. [clears throat] So um... How come you didn't buy when you had the chance? Too much DIY for me. That's my trouble... I take on things and I end up completely out of my depth. Yeah. I could say the same. So how come you've ended up as the decorator? You don't look like one. Ah, well... The boss thought we could save some money, so... I can't actually believe... Well, this is the last room I've got to do. As you can see, the... The lawn's become quite a tip. I'm going to leave that for her. You should be all right. [Peter] Yeah... That seemed to come from nowhere. Leave... Right now. Look, I... I'm pretty sure she used to live in my neighbour's house. You shouldn't listen to other people's tales, Peter. It hardly matters now, does it? They always get the stories wrong. [chuckles] This is... is just a leftover. OK? This is not a happy home. Well this home is all we have. We can't go back to the old life, there's only... Well, there's only this. Perhaps you can make a go of it elsewhere? No... No. Our... our goals are mis-matched now. Laura was never the one to... Go and take such a risk, like... You know, buying a house. There's a difference between gambling and taking a leap of faith, Peter. [Peter huffs] She was always the calm, considered one. You know? But now... Can't say I blame her. I'll turn up... - When you're further down the road. - [car door slams] Oh, shit. [sighs] [Blake] Do yourself a favour Peter, don't stay the night. What the hell, Peter, it's a bloody tip out here. You can call the skip people on Monday. [walking upstairs] Don't you want to sell it? Actually a guy popped round just now. Made some interesting noises. Said his name was Mr Blake. Did you get his contact details? He said he'd contact us when we're further down the road. I can't believe you didn't get his number. Didn't you see him on your way in? No? Ah, well, he has to be in the house. [door slamming, walking] Right, don't know where he went to. It's weird. So... Why you here? Did I leave my phone here yesterday? My- my work one's just about had it. Why have you brought your suitcase? - I thought you were finishing today... - I never told you that. After this room, I'm out. I know. I'm to blame for losing the first house. Well I hope it makes you happy since it's the last thing we do together. I just don't want to argue any more. [Laura laughs] What's so funny? My sister says hello. That's awfully nice of her. Found your phone. Hmm... Why haven't you changed the screen? I think I might a new house once we've sold this one. Give us a chance to fail at this one first, hey, Laura. Look Laura, you take the bed. You sure? I insist. It's my last night anyway, so. Is this the new mattress? Bloody hell, I'm not sleeping on that, it stinks. -Where's the number for the mattress people -Why buy a new one? Because houses sell better with new furniture in them. - What's this betting app doing on my phone? - Here. Oh... ha... wow. Yeah great, you've done something on the list. Number one, take the stuff from the garage and put it into boxes. That's great. Can't you just go to your parents, please? Can't you get the money back from your friend for the ring? - He was going to pop by today... - My dad needs the deposit this weekend. You, you can have your bed back. I meant to ask you about this. Ha... no idea, sorry. Where did you get it from? Via the curtains. I'm a hundred percent certain that this is the girl who used to live in Terry's house, right? This morning... He tells me she's haunting it. Something happened over there, that he's just not letting on. I've never seen a man shake like that Laura, he was... terrified. Right, so they want to move out... And now you believe in ghosts? Well of course not, but it was alarming to see them so frightened. That and the very real prospect of them losing the money on their property. Too far from the family is the normal excuse. Look... Terry's already complained to my manager that I mis-sold the house. But why would this photo just randomly appear here? Look, just forget about it, it's rubbish. I bet it's Terry planting these photos. Why the hell would he do that, Laura? 'Cos he realises he's made a mistake and he's just looking for someone to blame. Are you really scared? Not of ghosts. You know we can make a good profit on this house. Anyway, you can have the bed. Where are you going to sleep? On the clean sofa. Right... Cheers then. At least she left the pillows. [running outside] [girl] Mum? [curtains closing] [footsteps] [door opening] [Laura] Peter, did you hear that? There's voices, I could hear voices up here. [huffs] You didn't hear anything? It wasn't you? Have I ever talked in my sleep, Laura? No. - Laura, will you just go back... - Shh, shh. [running outside] It's probably just someone outside. Just stay here. [huffs] Peter? Peter? [door closes] Peter? [click] Peter? - Here... - You sure you didn't hear anything? [Peter sighs] Different place, different noises. Don't go. You'll be fine. Why did you really come? You know why. Just give up the blanket. What? Lights. They're still there. [sigh] Thought they'd gone? [Laura] What if that's man you met earlier? - Mr Blake? - Yeah. Hardly. Oh, this is ridiculous, it has to be Terry. [Peter] Look, I'll go over there to make sure it's them. If it's them, I'll make sure they're OK. [Laura] No, I'll go I want to have it out with him. [Peter] Really? Let's see if it really is the same girl he's been going on about. What if it's a burglar? If it's your Mr Blake, then you can rush over. [door closes] [Peter] Bloody hell, Laura. [dramatic music] [Laura] I've got to get up in the morning. Laura. You have to see this. [Laura sighs] Bring it over. Found this in the... other curtain. You're not gonna like it. This is Mr Blake. Our prospective buyer? Do you think he took the other photo? Don't look to me for answers, Laura. What did he say when he turned up this afternoon? Do you think he could be the child's father? He was unusually disturbed by that first photo. There's something very suspicious about this Blake guy. - What are you doing? - [curtains] See if another photo appears. [laughs] Out of thin air? It's been a very strange day, Laura. And it's only midnight. [sighs] Is that all? Blake... Pass me your laptop. Blake... we don't have his first name. That and the street name... should turn something up. Here. This is the only search result. What's a Ghost Girl? What the hell, Laura? Blake's a murderer? That's rubbish. It says a child murderer lived here. Here! Is that why the house was so cheap? Blake's name would have been on the deeds. If he'd owned it before. This is the story of the Ghost Girl. She peeks through curtains searching for the... person who killed her. I had no idea. I didn't know anything about this. [Peter] Losing money on the house is all that scares me. Well, ghosts and murderers scare me. [Peter] We haven't actually seen any. Do you think it's true? Let's not find out tonight. It's only going to stress us out. We bury the stories. Focus on... getting the house on the market. Why have these photos turned up today? Why did Blake turn up today? Why d'you think? Or was he just being nosy? Maybe he was looking for evidence that could incriminate him, and he's trying to cover it up. We should go to the police. After eight years? Look, nothing's going to change between now and the morning. OK? Battery's dying anyway. Oh, God, I've bought a monster of a house. What are we gonna to do? Look... We finish this room. And we put it on the market. Bit by bit. Just like you used to say. That bloody thing can go for a start. Oh... Yeah... I found this thing... behind the radiator. Oh, if my mum bought me this, I would definitely ask for my money back. [laughs] I can believe that. Ergh Oh... Just remembered where it'd come from. Poor girl. She looked so happy with him in the pictures. However she died. It's all a bit gruesome. Here look. Out of sight. [footsteps] [girl] Mum? Mum? Mum! [footsteps] [footsteps] [scrape] [noises] [curtains] [scrape] [scrape] [sighs] What the hell, Laura? I can hear something. [creak] [creak] [scrape] She must be the woman who owned Terry's house. You know her? They didn't say anything about a granddaughter. First I heard about the little girl, is... is from Terry. Look. Terry's probably reading the same website. Take it as fable until we know more. I don't know what to think. [Peter] You'll see it differently in the morning [sighs] [sighs] We're never gonna sell this place. There are no ghosts, Laura. We never believed in that stuff. Come on. [knock, knock, knock, knock] It has to be the front door. [knock, knock, knock] [knock, knock] No, it's the windows. It's the windows. [Laura] They might go away. Maybe it's Blake? Or Terry, it could be Terry? Who'd knock in the middle of the night? You did. [laugh] Shh.. Sounds like they've given up. Come on, go back to sleep. Come on. [car arriving] [running footsteps] [car arriving] [woman] She's hiding under the bed again, isn't she? [man] Get out! - [walking upstairs] - [door closes] [girl cries] [girl] Emily? [thunder] [curtains closing] Emily. [crack of thunder] [girl] Where's my little girl? [girl] Where is she? [crack of thunder] [woman] Emily? [woman] Emily... [woman] Mummy's going to get... You! - [Laura screams] - Laura, what the hell's going on? How the hell did it get there! - Get it away from me! - It's gone. It's just a crappy toy! Christ, what you doing now? It was in the bed! I've got to get out of here! You must have been dreaming! I knew would say that! I've got to get out! Right we're leaving, we're leaving. Come on, we've had enough of this place. You don't believe me! I don't want to see you upset, come on. [Peter] It's OK, look... OK, it's the wrong head. If we ever get out here, don't employ me as a handyman OK? OK, it must be broken from the... from the inside. OK, there's only one thing for it, babe. OK? OK? No, not again. Peter I don't care about the house or anything. I don't care either, I don't care either. Don't go out there, it's too dangerous. Don't you trust me? Don't you believe me? That I saw a ghost, I saw a ghost in here. I believe you saw something, Laura. It's not good enough, Peter. I don't want to stay in here myself. I'll be two minutes, OK? Emily! Her name was Emily. She told me her name was Emily. Listen, listen, I forgot to tell you what I found OK outside. There was a couple coming back from something or other right? I spoke to them. The guy told me about... a crazy woman who lived on our road. Come on, come on... Apparently... she would dress up as her daughter. And wander the streets asking if anyone had seen her little girl. She would post photos through... doors and any open windows. When she started knocking on doors and becoming threatening, they called the police. His son took this photo. Asked him to email it to me. [sigh] Right. They heard that she killed Mr Blake. So it's true? [chuckles] Well it can't be true. Because I was with Blake today. Maybe he was a ghost? [huffs] We need to get out of this room Laura, it will clear our heads. Whatever the stories are, they could cost us the house. What happened to her? She killed herself. - In here? - No... Hospital apparently. Look, we're stuck in this room and you wanna to stay? Yes. Yes. You don't get it, do you? If we hadn't given up the first time... we'd still be together. Look, I saw her. I saw her outline. - Are you sure, Laura? - Yes Let's find out. Battery's gone. What you're doing... It's not gonna work. What's in there? I told you. There's nothing. Can't find... wha... what's this? [rummaging in wardrobe] Um... It's to Emily, from Mr Blake. "Dear Emily... I hope you're well... I hope you're... settling in at your grandparents... I hope you won't blame me... about..." Uh.. I can't read the rest. [scrape] The picture frame's moved. "Love Emily." "Dear Mr Blake... I'm hiding my letter so mummy doesn't find it... You know what she's like... I don't want you to get hurt like daddy." "Happy ninth birthday, Emily." Hold on... 'Right, so... Emily survived. And moved in with her grandparents. I've seen this before. Not a copy but... When I moved the bed from the other room, I found an envelope with a... a letter opener stabbed through it. Inside was a letter just like this one. Of course, you threw it away. Yeah. Let's keep searching. Hey, another one. "Dear Mr Blake, mummy's gone funny. Please take me away, please hurry. Please, Emily." So Blake was helping Emily? He saved her. - I don't know what to think with these... - Just keep looking. If Blake... had... Emily taken away by social services, that would give the mother reason to harm him. Right? Hey. I'll find something to fish it out. Got it. Lovely. "Dear Mr Blake... Please keep mummy's toy safe... Mummy says I must not... Burn it... must not burn... Nannie... for she... er, will be mad. Love, Emily" Who the hell is Nannie? That's Nannie. "Nannie is always watching... Mummy says its eyes are watching me all the time... Please Mr Blake... hide Nanny... or... she'll find out where she is." 'Right so... So... is the mother dead or alive? And why did she disappear? [sighs] Well did she... Did she say anything? Mummy's going to get you. I bet she killed Blake. That's just hearsay again, Laura. The only one who knows is Emily. We should go. If the ghost thinks her daughter's been murdered we can convince Emily to come here. And why would we do that? Don't you think that's just... I don't know, a little bit thoughtless? Evidence that her daughter is still alive, could, could make her go away. I mean, she could have killed herself to be with her in the afterlife. - But of course, she's alive. - After life? Really? What about Blake? He came here to help us. You're making it up as you go along. Get a breather. Get out of this room... this house... this street - OK? Blake wants her to go, then he can go too. We need expert help on this. I understand you've seen things. I do, but... I saw the man alive and well today. It's really weird. When the mother was attacking me, she was... She was like solid, like a- -a real person but... Spongy... [laughs] Can't explain. Shaking Blake's hand... that was weird. Spongy like you say. He must be a ghost too. [sighs] I'm going to find Emily's number. Don't you think the girl's gone through enough? Gonna email... her grandparents. Got it. What are you going to say? I'll just make it up as I go along. No surprise there, then. Done. I've asked her to contact me a.s.a.p. Alright... Let's go. Shit. What? Oh, it's locked. No, it's too dangerous. [huffs, groans] [crash, fall] No, no, it's OK, it's just a... Er, it's just a sprain. I knew it. [gasp] No, wai... I'm come... Wait! Argh... I'll get you out. OK. [sigh] Come on... Phone dad. [phone rings] [phone cut off] Come on! [sighs] Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** [huffs] Phone Terry... [phone ringing] [phone] Hello, this is Terry please leave a message. Oh, shit... Come on... [phone ringing] [Terry] Hello? Hello? Hi, it's, it's, it's Laura. Er, Peter and Laura from across the road? Oh, God. Where are you? What the bloody hell's it to do with you? I'm phoning because there... There are lights on in your house. Why did you leave so quickly? Why do you think? I'm sorry... um... We didn't believe you. Oh, now you do believe me. Do you know anything about the previous owners? Have you ever met... a Mr Blake? Wasn't he your previous occupant? How would you know that? We went to your place first. Mr Blake turned up this afternoon, and... he spoke to Peter and said he was interested in buying the house. Impossible. He's dead. No... it was... It was definitely him that turned up this afternoon. If I was you, I'd find Peter and leave now. I can't get out. Look... Just... Please tell me why you left so quickly. Well... it started with the occasional photograph. Of a mother and little girl. There was an unearthly scream early this morning. I rush back upstairs. Poor Carol's been stabbed in the leg. And she tells me she was attacked by a... black shadow. Who was shouting at her. "Where's my little girl?" God knows what was going on. I'm sorry, that's awful. Is she OK? I'm... I'm so sorry. I have to admit, I don't know what to think. But I have to believe her. Have you, have you any idea why this would happen here? We had no idea. We're gonna sell it cheap to those builders. And if I was you, I'd do the same. God... [sniffle] Oh... my God. [dramatic music] [creak noises] [creepy voice] Emily... [Laura cries] [weird voice] Emily? [weird voices] Emily? Emily? [crying] [ghostly hiss] [light thump] [shifting noise] [thump] [light thump] [light thump] [light thump] [silence] Peter! [girl] Mum? Peter? Peter! [girl] Mummy? Peter! [girl] Peter? - [girl whispers] Where's my little girl? - [creak] [woman] Emily? [woman] Emily? Emily? [girl] Mum? [vocal noise] [dramatic music] [Laura cries] [girl shouts] Where is she? [scratch] [banging on door] Peter! - Is... is that you? - [curtains] Hurry! - [curtains closing] [Peter behind door] Yeah. [door handle rattle] Please! - [Peter] It appears to be stuck. - Yes, we know. Did you want me to have a go? Have you got the right screwdriver? Brought the whole bloody toolbox with me. It's not that. [rummaging through toolbox] Shit. Hang on a minute. Laura? Here... this is yours. I'm so sorry. I wish we could start again. - But we... [bang] - [woman] No! Peter? - Peter! [woman] You killed her! Peter! Answer me! Peter! [girl screams] - [bang] - [Laura] Oof! [girl shouts] Say it! [girl] You killed my Emily. [huffs and groans] [gasp] [argh] [argh] Laura? - [ahh...] - [creak] [gasp] [gasp] Laura? Laura! [sigh] Laura...? [inhales] [sigh] [creak] [creak] [inhales] [huffs] [phone rings] Hello? [teenager on phone] Is Laura there? I don't know. I don't know? [Emily phone] It's Emily. I'll phone later. Oh, no, wait. I'm her... I'm her friend. I saw her email. Oh. Right. [creak] [creak, creak] Emily... I've got to go. Please, you could, er... You could really help us with this, it's urgent. Hold on. [huff] [loud creak] [creak] [music] [woman whispers] Mummy's going to get you. [woman] You killed my Emily. [grunts] No... [grunts] - Stop! - Tell me! Where's my little girl? [grunts, groans] Stop! Say it! Mummy's going to kill you! Emily's alive! Liar... Liar! What did you do to Laura? - You killed my little girl. - We... [phone rings] Didn't! [phone rings] [grunts] Emily? Hello? [Emily] Yeah. Listen, um... Laura thought you could help us. We bought. Mr Blake's house. - Your mother... - She's dead. Emily, do you know what really happened to her? - You're one of those journalists. - No, no... We think she killed Mr Blake. No mummy didn't. [Emily] Who's that? We found your... your toy, the Sock Puppet? You killed my Emily. It was called Nannie? [screams, groans] [woman] Tell me! She made it to keep an eye on you. [Emily] How did you know that? [woman] Emily? [Emily] Who's that? Emily. [Emily] Who's that other person? Em... Can you remember? [Emily] It wasn't Mr Blake's fault. Mum used to frighten me. [Peter] Why? [Emily] When my dad died, she used to make me play in the rain. She was having a difficult time. I don't know why she hated him so much. [Peter] Was he a kind man? [Emily] He gave me a camera for my birthday. He let me print the photos... She didn't want me going round his house. So she broke my camera. Then she gave me the sock puppet. It was to watch me, she said. She was obsessed with the thing. It was supposed to make you love me. [Emily] I went to live with my grandparents. Mr Blake saw her dressing up in my old Halloween costume. I suppose she was just missing me... I guess I'll never know. My little girl. [Peter] Your daughter's got a life of her own now. Go. [Emily] Hello? - I'm sorry er... - [Emily] Um... [Emily] OK. I don't really know why I said all that. Perhaps it was time. Laura. Laura. She's not with you? Is she? Laura! No. [rustle] [Mr Blake] I saw her walking up the road. We all walk up the road eventually. It was Emily's mother, Peter. What, she killed you? My heart condition did that for me. She helped it on, though. When the mother was having one of her spells... Emily used to hide under her bed. And under that one too. Her mother tried to scare me off by hiding under it. But why did she want to kill us? She's a vengeful ghost. You know how it goes. Get rid of that thing, Peter. It's the link between us and you. Emily's puppet allows her mother to form into a solid being. She's gone now. I beat her. Burn it. It's time for all of us to move on. No... She's mine now. [grunts, groans] [huffs] Please... Stop! [grunts] Stop. No... [ghost cries] [argh... ] Give it... This is for Laura! [ghost] No... [theme music] [music] [sound of car arriving and stops] [car doors open and close] [dog barks] [approaching footsteps, rolling suitcase] [keys jangle] [front door opens] [Mum] Welcome to our new home, kids. - [children] Yay! - [running in house, dog barks] [child running upstairs] [Child] Yay. [Mum] Thomas! [doors opening and closing] [Dad] Hey... [a door closes] Come on back down. [running upstairs] What are you doing? [Child] There's a nice little lady upstairs. [Dad laughs] Don't be so silly, there's no one there. [Child] But she smiled at me. [Mum calls] Hey, you two! [Dad] Come on, let’s have a picnic in the garden. [Child] Aw... OK.
