Hi, baby! Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Mr. Sharma. You!? Why? Didn't you like my coming here? Hey! Take the proof of your love. I have many such proofs which I have kept very carefully. Are you trying to blackmail me? I agree, we don't share an intimate relation anymore.. but it's not right that you use such words for me. Before I leave for Calcutta, I want you to.. come to my room for sometime. So that at least once.. - What if I don't? Very simple. The proof of our love story will be handed over to your husband. And perhaps, your brother's wedding may also stop. Karuna was right. You are a very vile and a wretched man! Shut up! I am staying at Hotel Unique. Meet me at 8 p.m sharp. Give some pistachios for the sweet dish. Let's go. Every one remembers things at the last minute. Kamla. Kamla. How come you're here at this hour? - I want to tell you something.. but privately. Friends, please sit in that room for 2 minutes. I am scared, if I go to the hotel, he may do something to me. And if I don't, he has threatened to give the photographs to my husband. I don't understand what I should do. Wonder which unfortunate moment it was when I fell in love with him.. and I wrote letters to him. Oh God! Why don't you tell your brother? - Are you mad? If anyone else besides us, learns of this, I'll commit suicide. I am saying the truth, if he gives those letters to Deepak.. I swear it, I will commit suicide! Don't be silly! - You tell me what I should do? You had cautioned me against Brij and I was able save my honour. Now, only you can help me! Karuna, tell me something! When will the marriage procession arrive here? In an hour, but why? It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to go and return from the hotel. What do you mean? - I'll get your letters back. You'll go the hotel? - He will not dare to touch me. No, Karuna! You are getting married today. Yes, but it is my duty to save my in-law's house from disgrace! What if the procession arrives before your return? If I am destined to get married, nothing will go wrong. You handle everything here, okay. Karuna. Will you wait here? - I am in a hurry, madam. Wait for 5 minutes, I'll be back soon. Okay. I'll go home later. First, I'll complete your work in Poona. Okay? - Okay. Yes, please.. In which room is Mr. Brij Bhushan staying? Brij Bhushan? In room number 417. Thank you. Come in! Please come in. So Kamla has sent you here? What will you have? - Kamla's letters. That you will get but, what will you drink? A soft drink, a hot drink or.. - I want Kamla's letters. Aren't you getting married today? - Yes. And you are.. Didn't you get scared coming here, at this time? I heard Kamla saying that you had praised me a lot. That I am a rogue, a wretched man who's full of lust! I don't have time and.. - And I don't let time slip by. That night, because of you, Kamla slipped out from my hands. But today because of her, you have come to me. Time has settled the matter. Should I also do the same? What do you mean? It is very clear. You need Kamla's love letters.. and I want a price for those letters. What price? - Marriage! What? Not for life, only for sometime. - Shut up! Why are you getting angry? I was only asking a price of this. If you can't oblige, it's okay. Think about it, I have a customer who will buy them. Kamla's husband! What is the hurry, madam? Leave me! After I get my price, I'll leave you. How long will it take? - Give us 5 minutes more. Looks like she is explaining a lot of things to her. Who is it? -How long will your private talk go on? I will open the door when we are through. Let's go, looks like it is a very long story. Driver, drive fast. How much is it? - Six rupees, forty paise. I don't have the change. Keep the change. - Keep the change? Wow! It's a very good day for me. Karuna. - Kamla. Thank God! - Take your letters and burn them. Did he give it easily? - Do you think he would? But I have taught him such a lesson that he'll always remember. What happened? The procession is approaching, I'll tell you later. You forgot to add sugar. - Why are you wasting the sugar? Hold her finger and stir the coffee, it will become sweet. Kamla. Yes, I am coming. I remembered a joke. A man reached a doctor. And said "I have amnesia, I forget everything". The doctor asked, since when? - He said, 'what since when?' Is your joke over? Please laugh! Hey listen! Stop the party now. Aren't you concerned about the new bride? Wow! - New bride. We forgot that he has just got married. It is 3 O' clock in the morning. He is already late! Karuna. Sit down! I know you are very tired. Even I am very tired. - But everything has gone wrong. What went wrong? You are sitting as though I am a stranger to you. Take off your veil! Why? You were never shy before marriage! It was different then. My aunty told me while leaving.. that a new bride should feel shy. And what should I do according to your aunty? Why should I tell you? You go and ask your uncle. No! He is the deputy commissioner of police. I can't ask him. But yes, my other uncle did say something.. Oh yes! He told me that I should very lovingly.. lift my bride's veil. Then do it, I am feeling stifled. Look into my eyes! Aunty told me not to look into your eyes immediately. My uncle gave me a solution for this problem. He told me that if your bride doesn't look into your face. Then very lovingly lift her face and say that you love her. And then, kiss her immediately. - But my aunty never told me this. She didn't.. But my uncle told me to do so. Aunty did not tell me. - Uncle told me! Hey! Didn't he sleep here last night? He must be drunk! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! I will do all that, you go for a bath. I take only 2 minutes for a bath meanwhile, you do you make up. What are you doing? - I am applying lipstick. Why do you need to colour your lips artificially? I will colour them right away! Oh! - Father. - I'm sorry. I'm more than sorry. Never mind, you carry on, I'll come later. Come in, father. Did you have an important work? - No, nothing important! Fool! Couldn't you close the door? I was.. What? - I was packing. Ask your mother, we didn't meet anybody for 2 days after marriage. And you both don't look as though you have been married. Anyway, come for breakfast. And listen.. And finish your work and come! There's Take the photographs! Mahadev. And you take the fingerprints on the glass. Okay. Sir, this wallet. - Yes, keep it. K. Sir, the DCP has come. Good morning Inspector Kamat. Good morning. Your area is progressing a lot, 3 murders in 2 days. This is the influence of films. My jurisdictions has 5 cinema halls. Out of which, one has a story of thieves, 2 of bandits.. .. and 2 murder mysteries. These films teach ways to break the law and now.. They have started teaching ways to fool the police also. And we get into trouble. It's a part of our business, my boy. I have called the hotel manager. I will need your help. Sure. Sure. Any time. The man is dead. But why should his murder defame our hotel? Tell the staff to say that Mr. Brij Bhushan was a decent man. You follow me? - Yes, sir. The police shouldn't know more than this. Okay? - Okay. Usha, your brother has found a wife for himself. He is after her since last evening. Take this! - No, thank you. Usha, why do you have a swelling on your forehead? I slipped in the bathroom yesterday. Hey, brother Vikram! Please come here. Sorry, we disturbed you. - No problem! But when are you getting married? - Marriage? Oh, Usha's marriage! It will happen very soon. If you know of someone then please let me know. I am asking about your marriage. My marriage? - Yes. You mean, my marriage? The chances are very less. - Why? I cannot get married until she doesn't get married. See, everyone is laughing at my helplessness. Hello! This Kailash Chandra speaking. Is Mr. Anand there, the DCP would like to speak to him. Let me speak first. Sir, it's the judge.. Oh! It's my brother. Hello, brother! Hello, tell me sir what are your orders? Didn't you go for a walk today? - There you spoke like a fool! Who gets up early in the house full of guests? You left early but we were awake till wee hours of the morning. I know. I know. Is Anand at home? - What is that matter. I had some work in the office if it is possible for him to come.. Now I am confident that you should have been a constable and not a DCP. Yes. I know. I know. He is going for his honeymoon and you are calling him for work? Aren't you ashamed of calling yourself his uncle? You should hide your face with share. - Okay! Yes. Yes. Yes. Brother. Looks like the line got cut! Try again. Who is speaking? - Munna, this is grandfather speaking. Who, small grandpa? I know. I know. Call your uncle! - Uncle! Uncle, it is small grandpa on the line.

Till I read this, you get the photographs, fingerprint reports.. ..and the hospital reports.. ..we will have to go to Hotel Unique for on the spot enquiry. Okay, boss. Anand, I sometimes feel sorry for you. - Why? As for as reports are concerned it's ok but, you are serious about work. Pay attention, if you wouldn't take the case today.. ..then you would be out on your honeymoon today evening. What do you mean? - I am talking about your honeymoon! Get the reports immediately. Hi, Karuna. - Hi. You look very cute. Thank you. Congratulations Karuna! Where is Anand? He must be on his way. I sing along with the saints.. I also go and pray in the temples. I hope I don't turn into God. What did you say? I meant God. I hope I don't turn into God. Thinking of that, I don't even commit sins. Wow! Here comes Anand! - You are late for your our party? Sorry. Sorry. The people in the police are never in time! Where were you? - Sorry. I had to go far an urgent case. What was so urgent? A man was murdered in Hotel Unique yesterday. Did you find the murderer? - All we know is that it is a woman. It is the age of the women, friends! First they killed with their looks. Now, they have started using weapons. Anand, did you find a clue about the killer? All I know about the killer is that.. .. she has an innocent face but an evil heart! Wow! Now sing a song! Hey no! I can't sing. - Wow! Wow! You will have to sing! "I know this much about the assassin.." "..she has an innocent face, but she's black-hearted" "..she has an innocent face, but she's black-hearted" "I know this much about the assassin.." "..she has an innocent face, but she's black-hearted" "She lowers her gaze, feigns ignorance.."

"..how my suffered. It burnt in the fires of passion" "She was in my embrace, but at heart, I still pined" "There was a stillness in the air, I was almost out of my senses" "She was driving me crazy.. how beautiful the assassin looked" "I shall lift the veil from your face.."

"Forget whatever has happened in the past" "Remember the times you met her secretly" "How you used to gaze into each other's eyes" "Nights that were longer than days, spent talking about each other" "How helpless you felt! You were distanced from each other" "Having lost your heart, you used to wander aimlessly" "You thought you'd die and your desires would remain unfulfilled" "That's exactly why I had extended my support.." "I had steered your boat to the shores" "That's exactly why this beauty is so vain" "That's exactly why this beauty is so vain" "She's drunk on her own beauty" "Look how she sits.. all decked up" "She's forgiven seven murders.. not just one" "She's forgiven seven murders.. not just one" "The law is also bowled over by her.." "she has an innocent face, but she's black-hearted" "she has an innocent face, but she's black-hearted" Wonderful. Wonderful. What is the matter? Why do you look so scared? Kamla, Brij is dead! - What? When did he die and how? How did you know? Your brother said it. He is handling the case. Oh God! - And he even knows that the murderer is a woman. What will happen now? How will I face anyone? I will be in a big trouble, Karuna. Deepak will throw me out of the house. And my parents will also not accept me. No one will accept me, Karuna. Don't cry! Nobody will know anything. Then will you.. - Yes, if I am caught.. ..then I will take the blame on myself. - No, Karuna! I am the one at fault. I had written those letter's. You went there because of me. Because of me.. Kamla, I went there because you are my husband's sister. You are the daughter of my in law's. It was my duty to save you from that rogue's clutches. I went to Brij to save the honour of this house.. I will never open my mouth and put that honour at stake. I will die but never tell anyone about it! Karuna. Let's go, they all must be waiting for us. Where are you? Come here! Where do you go early in the morning? Sit. - Shall I make your tea? Before that, give me some cough syrup. Do you have a sore throat? - No, to change the taste of my mouth. Leave me! The phone is ringing since so long. Hello! Is Mr. Anand there? - Who is speaking? I am Sharma, the manager of Hotel Unique. Who's call is it? - It is Mr. Sharma from Hotel Unique. Hello, Mr. Sharma! It's nice that you returned from Poona, our case was not progressing. You are the one who can identify the killer. You had seen and spoken to that woman. Your colleagues said that on 24th March, the night of the murder.. remember, a girl had enquired about Brij Bhushan to you? Good. So when will you meet me? You can come at my place. Hey! No some guests are leaving today. Are you in the hotel? I will meet you there at around 11. a.m. Okay? Okay. Thank you. What did you do? Okay then! Please have control over Anand. These police people like to boss even at home. Drop me on the way. Karuna. Karuna. I am leaving you alone to face all the problem. But I am helpless or else, I wouldn't leave you in this dilemma. Hurry up, it's getting late. Take care of yourself. I am going! "I face a grave predicament in my life.." "..how on earth am I going to solve it?" "I face a grave predicament in my life.." "..how on earth am I going to solve it?" "I'm like the boat caught in a storm.." "..how will I steer it to safety?" "The pain that lies in my heart.." "The pain that lies in my heart.." "I can't explain how agonising it is" "I can't explain how agonising it is" "I do want to tell those that I love.." "but I still can't bring myself about to tell them" "but I still can't bring myself about to tell them" "Like the tears that flow from my eyes.." "Like the tears that flow from my eyes.." "I wish I could flow away too" "I face a grave predicament in my life.." "how on earth am I going to solve it?" "I'm like the boat caught in a storm.." "how shall I steer it to safety?" My profession is such that I have to keep my ears and eyes open always. Whatever I see, is immediately stored in my mind. Really? - I have just met you. But I know that you are wearing brown socks and black shoes. That's strange! And you use your left hand more than right. How did you notice that?! - As your come here.. you took out the cigarette packet with left hand, lit the match .. and now you are pulling the chair also with left hand. Mr. Sharma, you are just fantastic. If you have such a good memory then you surely must remember that girl? Of course! I can describe her perfectly. As she stepped from the taxi. - Taxi? Yes, a taxi. - Do you remember the taxi number then? I am sorry. I did not see that. But it was a fiat taxi. Which model? - It was Premier President Safari model Good. Good. Good. Then it won't be a problem searching the taxi. Tell me, how can I help you? I want the number and the addresses of the owners of the Safari Taxies. Come tomorrow, today I am busy. Look, it very important. - I told you, I don't have time. The commissioner has sent me here! Yes, the commissioner has sent me here. Do you also, like me.. - Sometimes! Then your work will be done first. Please sit! Thank you. So nice. Next. - 4.. Say it in Hindi. - 47. M. R. T. - T. 2. 8. 3? - 4. 4. Name. - Krishnakant. Keralal Kishen. Kishen. - C/o.. - C/o.. Kulveer Singh. - Singh. Ko.. Koilewala.. - Koilewali.. Koliwada. - Koliwada. There aren't any further. - No more? Thanks for your co-operation. Aren't you like me? - Of course not! I was sympathizing with you. I am not like you. Goodbye. What a CID inspector he is, he is, trying to imitate me! Hey! Where is this taxi owner, Nafasat Ali's house? This is it. - This is it? If that girl come in front of you, can you identify her? Yes. But what has she done? - Nothing much, just a murder! What happened? - Nothing! I found this letter in the cab that night. I think it belongs to her. Oh! Even this has the same 'K'. - Let me see! Yeah! it's the same. It says 'only my, Brij'. Brij? He is talking of the same girl who went to the hotel that night. I was not aware that even murderers write love letters! All right, you drive. Read it. 'My dear, Brij. It is not just a letter or words written in ink.. it's my breath, which has come in form of words, on this paper. That means, she must have gone to take her letters back from him. Why would she want to do that if she loved him? Besides, why will she kill her own lover? Perhaps, she was in love with him then.. ..and now she loves someone else. You are right. Brij must have refused to give the letters, so she must've killed him. This is road from when she hired the taxi and also got down. Which way did she go? - No idea where she has gone. It won't be difficult to find her. - Why? She is your sister-in-law. - What? Didn't you get married to a girl from this area? So aren't you the son-in-law of this area? Good you reminded me. I had to go there, let's go. No, I am not coming. You can go ahead! I will take him to office and note his statement. Let's go! - Goodbye, sir. Let's go. Child, you also have tea with us. - I'll have it here, father. I have to make food for your journey.. ..if I leave it on Ramu Kaka, you'll miss your train. I am dependent on her, after her mother's death. Now that she too has gone, this house feels very lonely. I don't feel like staying here. - Are you going to Haridwar? Yes. It is better to go for pilgrimage at this age. Anyway, tell me when are you getting your holidays.. And has your case ended yet or no? It has almost ended. I have got a very big evidence today. Really? - Yes,.. See this! This letter belongs to that murder which she dropped in the taxi. Father, I am sure that this letter will help me to find that girl. Dear Karuna, I haven't heard from you since I have come here. I console myself that.. ..if there is no news, then all is well there. Stop it now! Why are you writing such a big letter? I am just ending it! Believe me, all I do is think about you. Whenever I think of it, I curse myself. Why did I let you go to the hotel? I hope that brother can never ever solve this case. And it gets closed without ending. Lots of love, your Kamla. Postman. Take your post. This is Kamla's letter! Hey! Inspite of being my wife, you are getting scared? What if he gets Kamla's letter and he recognises her writing? Come on, give. Car for sale. Do you know, mother and father have taken Munnu out. Really? - And Jeetu has gone to the market. Really? Shankar is not well. He is not well? - Really? You have returned back tired and now you're sitting with this mail. Let's of upstairs. Let me see if there is something important. "All day and night.." "it's work, work and work" "All day and night, it's work, work and work" "All day and night, it's work, work and work" "Why don't you, honey, ever talk about love?" "You take no break from work.." "You take no break from work.." "I'm not going to talk to you, my love" "All day and night, it's work, work and work" "Why don't you ever talk about love, sweetheart?" "Why is my heartbeat exposing my secrets today..?" "it's revealing my secret" "I know it, he doesn't.." "what it means to pine like this" "what it means to pine like this" "You couldn't ever read what's in my heart.." "You couldn't ever read what's in my heart.." "I'm not going to talk to you, my love" "All day and night, you talk only about work" "Why don't you ever talk about love, sweetheart?" "You promised me so much in love.." "so what holds you back today?" "so what holds you back today?" "I can't bear the idea of being with you.." "and yet being so far away from my sweetheart" "and yet being so far away from my sweetheart" "You're the one for whom my passions are aroused.." "You're the one for whom my passions are aroused.." "but I'm not talking to you, my love" "All day and night, you talk only about work" "Why can't you ever think of love, honey?" "You can't ever take a break from your work.." "You can't ever take a break from your work.." "I'm not talking to you.." Shreekanth. What are you doing? - I've caught him with great difficulty Oh! Is he is the one? Then welcome him warmly. Take this, put him inside, I will deal with him. Make arrangements for his welcome. - Come on! Take him gently. - Ok, sir. Let us go. Very good, Shreekanth! You will definitely go up. Vikram. Come here. This is the Joshi lane Junction.. ..from when she boarded the taxi. And where she even got down. - Correct. That means, her house should be maximum within is 1 mile area. Correct. That means, she lives within this area. As soon as we find her, I become an inspector and you, the ACP. For that we'll have to check every house in that area. The girls who live in this area, on the night of murder,.. or the girls who were in the area, we will have to list them out. Oh God! This time I will not be able to do the work. - Why? I have lost my patience, searching for the taxi driver. This time, hand over this task to someone else. The promotion will also go to someone else. Yes, give it to someone else. Am I not your friend? Am I your enemy? Okay, tell me. Girls with initial 'K'.. I have to list out the girls with the initial 'K'. Then list the girls who are match Sharma's and Nafasat's description. Correct. - That means, age is 18-25 years.. ..beautiful girl, fair complexion and average height! Absolutely correct. - Absolutely right? There must be thousand of houses in that area.. And it will take at least 2 months to list them out! It will but, if you have to be an inspector then.. I will start right away! Thank you very much for the advice. Munna, come here and give me these books. Hey! Junior Judge. - Did you say something? Yes. Keep those glasses aside and help me. Nobody lets me read in this house. Keep them properly or grandfather will get very angry. He'll say why did you teach my books? - Brat! You're a copying me? What were you doing? - There was dust on the books. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Why do you start screaming when you enter the house? Look what Karuna's is doing? - What is she doing? Just see! When you get married you did not work for 1 year. And she is married for less than a month and.. she is working. - I didn't tell her. Father, I was getting bored, so I did it. Even I was getting bored. - Now I understand! Nonsense! I have told you to give top priority to assembly questions. Why didn't you put a red tape on it? - I'll just put it. Keep it in mind and work. - Okay, sir. Idiot. Deputy commissioner here.. Which fool made you a D.C? - Brother, you? Yes it's me, you are a constable, not a D.C. I get into trouble because of you. I did it, sir. Yes, I am aware. I know. I know. What 'I know, I know'! You don't know anything. You can't do anything yourself. I put the slip, can I keep it, sir? - Keep it. What, should I keep the phone? - I meant, you are right. If that's so then, send Anand home.. tell him Karuna is not feeling well. What happened? - Why are you asking? You didn't let them go on a honey-moon. You've involved Anand in work. I wish I could demote you to a constable. I know. I know. Thank you, sir. I will send him right away! - Okay. Has Anand come? Anand, come into my office. "We will take away.." "We will take away the bride.." Be careful, you will hurt aunty. "We will take away granny." Go play outside. "We will take away.." - You are getting late for school. "We will take away the granny.." Wait you brat, I will get you! His father was the same. He had become a major.. ..but he acted like a kid. Whenever he came home there would be happiness all around. His wife used to comb my hair the same way, everyday. Seeing my white hair, she would pull it out. She'd say you're not my mother-in-law.. ..but like my elder sister. She passed away while delivering Munna. The next day we received the news.. ..of my son's death. In two days, I had aged 20 years more. God had no mercy on that child! He did not see his mother's or father's face at all. Child! - Come in, Ramu Kaka. Hello, madam! - Hello! Few of her clothes were left back. I have got them and your father had left a letter for you.. ..while leaving. You take the clothes, I'll go and see where Munna is. Jeetu, make tea for Ramu Kaka. Okay. Come, Ramu Kaka. Come, first have cold water and then hot tea! You? Didn't I catch you? What were you doing so secretly? I was putting those clothes.. - Don't lie! I have seen with my own eyes. - What? That thing you are trying to hide. Come on, give. I am not talking about this. I mean that thing.. Hey! I am talking of the thing that can be seen from your blouse. Move away! - Whose letter is that? Oh! It is my father's letter, read it. I will read it later, first remove your sari. What are you saying? - Come on, hurry up, remove your sari! How can I.. Look what I have got for you. - It's such a nice colour. I want to see how this colour looks on your fair skin. How do I look? - How do I look? How do I look? Munna, give me the shawl. - No, I won't! Please Munna, give it. - Don't give. Munna. - Be careful. - No, I won't give. Uncle, hold me. Not me, uncle. Hold this shawl. Very good, don't give it back. Okay! - Great. Don't give it, uncle. Hold it tight, don't give it. Hold it tight, don't give it. Uncle, hold it right. - Leave it! Who needs the shawl? I need the owner of the shawl. Even I need the owner of the shawl. Munna, grandmother is calling you. No, she sent me here to call you. You come with me. Is the list ready or not? - Just a minute. There are 11 girls with the initial 'K', who can be doubted. Only 11? - Yes. That means, it's easy to get them. Out of this, the first 3 girls are out of town.. they have been informed, we will interrogate them, when they return. Out of the remaining 8 girls, the 11th girl can be ignored. Why? - Because she has a strong alibi. At the time of murder, she was getting married. Yes! With a foolish CID Inspector. Then why did you write Karuna's name? With the fear that you may question me later.. ..that why didn't I mention her name? Get these 10 girls identified by Mr. Sharma. - Okay. And I will interrogate the 11th girl on my own. What is the need? - I'll just have some fun. Oh! So you also like to joke? - Your company has an effect on me. Good. Good. Very good. Carry on. I hope that she doesn't get serious. I will pacify her. - All the best. Didn't I tell you, I don't know of any Brij Bhushan. Try to remember properly, he was your lover. Aren't you ashamed? - Yes, I am. But since I am a CID inspector, I will have to interrogate you. Besides, I have a complain against you. You did not write a single love letter to me, as you wrote to Brij. This is a lie! Did you marry with your own choice or were you compelled to? Or did you have a fight with Brij? I told you, I was not connected with him, I only.. Okay, why are you screaming so much? Okay, I agree that you did not know him. When did you get married? - Why, don't you know? Oh yes! Even I was present. Wasn't it on 24th March? Brij was murdered on the same night. What time did you get married? I think it was 10 p.m. And as per the post mortem report, the murder was between 8 to 9 p.m. That means, after the murder, you could sit in the marriage hall? Now you will say that you did not kill him. Then answer my question. What were you doing at the hotel that night? And it was 8 p.m when my friend saw you getting into a lift. That means, you had.. ..what happened, Karuna? Karuna. Karuna. What happened? I was joking. Karuna. Jeetu. Jeetu. Shankar. "My heart, caged for life.." "My heart, caged for life.." "how shall it ever be set free? "how shall it ever be set free? "Live, I must.." "until I breathe my last" "until I breathe my last" "I can't even breathe freely anymore.." "I can't even breathe freely anymore.." "how shall I bear this burden?" "This grave predicament of my life.." "how will I ever solve?" "I'm like a boat caught in a storm.." "how shall I steer it to safety?" "This grave problem of my life.." Let's go, Mr. Anand. Tell me, Mr. Sharma, who is the one? That girl is not present here, Mr. Anand. What are you saying? Are you sure? Yes, that girl is not here. Mr. Sharma, check once gain., It has to be one of these girls. No Mr. Vikram, you can send them away. Shall I leave them? Thank you. This girl seems to be quite smarter than we anticipated. Hiring a taxi from one junction and leaving at the same spot.. was to fool the police. What shall we do now? I don't understand. No Anand, it's no point wasting more time on this case. Close it and put it as a dormant file. This will be injustice to me. Give me some more time. Or else, it will tarnish my career forever. I know you have worked very hard on this case. Hard work! I have invited the wrath of my family for this case.. I have hurt Karuna, sacrificed my happiness.. and now, when I am close to my destination.. Anand. Don't be so serious about this case. I know you've worked very hard. Read my remarks, I've blamed you. If the case closes, I will obviously be blamed. And the department will consider it as my defeat. What defeat? The ones who lose hopes are defeated. In fact, seeing your efforts, you've been made an ACP. Congratulations! - Thank you, sir. But sir, don't close this case. Give me some more time. If you want to progress.. ..then you should accept victory and defeat! Probably, closing this case may do some good to you. Listen, you make arrangements to go out of Bombay. I've been neglecting another case since 4 months, for this one. Which case? - Your wife, Karuna's case. I have sanctioned your leave. Take these 2 plane tickets. It is my gift for your honeymoon. Cheer up, man. And have a good time. Come on, man. If you go home like this, Karuna will think you've had a fight. Come on. Hello! - Hello, Karuna. This is Vikram. You've got a promotion. My promotion? - Your husband has become an ACP. Really? This is a good news! That hotel unique murder case.. ..due to which your honeymoon was canceled that case is closed.. Hello! Hello! "You look so sweet today.." "you look more like a rose that blossoming" "What's special then..? - There is something" "What secret is it..? - There is something" "You look so sweet today.." "you look more like a rose that blossoming" "What's special then..? - There is something" "What secret is it..? - There is something" "You were your usual self till yesterday, but today.." "what has transpired?" "Between yesterday and today, I happened to meet happiness" "I happened to meet happiness" "What sort of happiness..? - I'm not telling you" "Aren't you telling me..? - No, I'm not telling you" "You won't tell your sweetheart? What happiness is this?" "For the first ever time, I'm in love with life" "I smile today, for Spring is mine" "What's so special..? - There is something" "What secret is it..? - There is something" "You have no clue how delighted I am to see you happy" "..how delighted I am.." "My eyes will tell you what's in my heart" "..what's in my heart." "So what do your eyes say? - I'm not telling you" "Aren't you telling me..? - Yes! I'm not telling you" "Else, when have you ever flattered me unless you want something?" Is it so? "You look very sweet today.." "I can see the excitement on your face" "So what's special..? - There is something" "What secret is it? - There is something" "So what's special..? - There is something" "What secret is it? - There is something" That is like it! It should be known that our son has become on ACP. Everyone gives a party but there should be something more to it. Vikram, there should be song and dance programme. That too only girls should dance. - What do you mean, uncle? I mean that they should be good dancers. The programme will be suspense. - Okay, there should be a song also. "I've been robbed by those pretty lassies.." "the ones with fair cheeks and long, black hair" "Your eyes aren't eyes. They're daggers that pierce my heart" We have engaged this hall for the party. There's a small hall adjoining this, where the food will be served. The complete arrangement should be good. Don't worry, Mr. Vikram. All the arrangements will be perfect. Very good. - When is the party? Anand and his wife have gone to Kashmir. They couldn't go earlier because of the murder in the hotel. When are they coming? - Saturday. The party is on Sunday at 8 p.m. Sunday evening, 8 p.m! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As you all know, that this party is in honour of.. the retired Judge Kailashnath's, just retired from Kashmir.. Mr. Anand's .. I'm sorry. just returned from Kashmir Mr. Anand Chand. This party is due to Mr. Anand's promotion. We hope that next year, we will once again.. have this party to welcome the arrival of a junior ACP. So ladies, gentlemen and policemen.. The special item for the evening is wives.. the policemen's wives. So hear the woes of the policemen's wives? "It remained in my heart for so long.." "and it comes to my lips today" "By marrying my sweetheart.." "how I've lost out on the best years of my life" "My sweetheart has eyes for the whole world.." "I'm the only one he will not cast a glance at" "My sweetheart has eyes for the whole world.." "I'm the only one he will not cast a glance at" "What a waste.." "Oh, what a waste of my passionate youth.." "he just won't look at me" "he just won't look at me" "I swear it on God.. - I swear by my dreams" "By God, I rue the moment I looked into his eyes" "I was out of my mind to have married him" "Oh, the sweet words he used to steal my heart" "He made such tall claims to ensnare me" "Which police station will I report my cruel husband to?" "He refuses to look at me" "He refuses to look at me" "My husband has eyes for the whole world.." "I'm the only one he won't cast a glance at" "He refuses to look at me" "I've borne enough tyranny. I can't take it anymore" "My father-in-law is better. He at least takes Ma-in-law out" "If anyone would care to see.." "the father's far more energetic than the son" "How I regret becoming an Inspector's wife" "He'd rather grab criminal's necks, but not my hand" "I can't take this death anymore" "But I'm not keeping quiet anymore, I'm a fiery lady" "He won't even talk at home.." "He won't even talk at home, but kicks up a fuss outside" "Oh, he won't even cast a glance at me" "Oh, he won't even cast a glance at me" "My husband has eyes for the whole world.." "but I'm the only one he won't cast a glance at" "Oh, he won't even cast a glance at me" May I come in, sir? - Yes. Come in, Mr. Sharma. I'm sorry, I couldn't speak to you last night. Please sit. Have you come regarding the bill? Who cares about the bill? I have get a very good news for you. That girl is found. - Which girl? The one who was involved with the murder case in our hotel. You found that girl? Tukaram, get the Unique Hotel murder case file immediately. Alright. Mr. Sharma, where did you see her? I will tell you but I should also get a reward for it. Yes, of course! If it is that girl, I will personally reward you. Then listen, I saw that girl last evening in your party. In my party? - Yes. What is her name? - I don't know, but.. I can describe her with my photographic memory. Fair complexion, big eyes, beautiful body.. ..she had worn big earnings and a matching necklace.. ..and a diamond nose pin! Which colour sari was she wearing? - It was a white 'Gharara suit' She was very beautiful! You idiot.. Do you know whom you are talking about? She is my wife! - Your wife!? Yes. - But how can it be possible? I remember very well that.. But how can she be your wife? I could possibly be wrong. No. I'm sorry. - Get out! Get out! Sir, file.. You were in Kanpur for quite long. - Yes, I went there only for 15 days. But I fell sick when I reached there. Pick up the phone. Since morning there have been many wrong numbers. These Bombay phones are such! Hello! - Karuna.. Hello, Anand! This is Usha speaking. How are you?.. Yes, I will just call her. Karuna, it's your wrong number! Hello! - Karuna. Will you go out for a film? - Film? What is it, don't you have work today that you thought of me? Okay, listen, get Usha along. I will reach by 3 O'clock sharp. Oh my! Now why has this stopped? Why don't you sit close to him? Looks like the engine has got cold! Hey! I am talking about the car. I think we should go by a taxi. Let's go. - Okay. You're not taking us out willingly.. ..if the beginning is such the film will surely be a flop! Never mind, I yet want to see it! There is a taxi! Is it engaged? - No, sir. Chandan cinema. - Chandan cinema? Ok, sir. You go ahead, I am coming. Did you recognize? - Yes. Who was it? - The one in red sari. Are you sure? - Yes! I had seen her very clearly. You don't get passengers everyday who give a big tip. This handwriting does not match with Karuna's handwriting. I know it. How does it matter? What are you saying! She is innocent.. Sharma and Nafasat Ali's identification can be wrong. And yet you say, how does it matter? There were many girls at the party.. ..why did Sharma point towards Karuna? Why only her? Why did not Nafasat Ali point at Usha.. But what about this writing? This letter is not written by Karuna. Letters can be written by someone else also. Are you mad? - I am not mad. You have not seen her nervousness. I did not pay attention then. But today if we believe that.. ..she has killed him then, I know the reason of her nervousness. And if she actually has done it then.. ..she has deceived two people at the same time. She first kills her ex-lover.. ..and after sometime, with the some blood stained hands, she's weds me. He keeps her husband in dark! Just think, a girl who can be so smart and clever.. ..can't she tell someone else to write her love letter? Why don't you understand.. ..if someone else wrote those letters.. ..then why would she bother about those letters? Why would she go to the hotel on her wedding night? Are you sure, she went to take back her letters? It could be that along with the letters.. ..there was something more some photographs or something else. Why are you seeing this case with only one angle? What is wrong with you? You want to ruin the person you love? Yes Vikram, I love her very much! That is the tragedy of my life! - Then end this tragedy. Close the case. Retrace your steps. Or your happiness will be.. What life? The life which is full of doubts is not worth living. When she's close to me, I'll have only one question on my mind.. ..that is she a killer! No my friend, I will not be able to go through that dilemma. It would be better that it is decided once and for all. What kind of decision? The one last thing that will prove her crime are her finger-prints. "I face a grave dilemma in life.." "how will I solve it?" "I face a grave dilemma in life.." "how will I solve it?" "My own sweetheart has caused me so much of grief.." "how shall I explain it?" "Her promises of love have turned out to be fake.." "Her promises of love have turned out to be fake.." "my bond of faith with her is severed" "my bond of faith with her is severed" "As my companion for life.." "why is she robbing me of my peace?" "my bond of faith with her is severed" "..to such a companion? "How can I ever be loyal to such a companion?" "I face a grave crisis in life.." "how am I to solve it?" "I face a grave crisis in life.." Who is it? I am coming! Anand, you? Come in. - Take this glass. It has some finger prints, I need the prints urgently. You'll get it by afternoon. - I say urgent. I'm in the office, get the report. But it will take some time for this work. What a strange man he his! Anand, the prints and the report is ready. Keep it on the table. Won't you see it? - I'll see it later? Then why did you keep me awake the whole night? At least say sorry. - Thanks for your work. "There are so many secrets.." "There are so many secrets.." "my destiny keeps from me" "my destiny keeps from me" "No one knows what twist life might take" "..what twist life might take." "I cannot foresee what destiny has in store for me.." "I cannot foresee what destiny has in store for me.." "every moment, I dread what might be unleashed on me" "I face a crisis in life.." "how am I to solve it?" "The anguish my dear ones have caused me.." "I can barely speak about it" "I face a crisis in life.." You should feel happy about your success. Why don't you arrest Karuna? So is the report.. - Didn't you see the report? These finger prints match perfectly with those prints. These are the same fingerprints found on the candle stand.. ..and the table. So what if the domestic peace is ruined. For a honest inspector, his duty is foremost. Your name and photograph will be printed on the official gazette. Besides, it is not easy to get a gold medal. But if you happen to see the death of your love, then close your eyes? Vikram. - People don't purposely ruin their own houses. I told you not to go ahead, Anand! It's yet not late. I am not a police officer at this hour.. I'm your friend. Listen to me.. Burn the report and close the case and forget about the murder. And forget about the murder in the Hotel Unique. Please forget it! I request you to forget it. Shut up! Our daughter-in-law and she.. It is a lie! Fingerprints never lie, sir! How did this happen? What will brother think.. What will happen to our honour, your life? Why did this case come to us? O God! O God! Sir, we will have to arrest Karuna. I know. I know. It is very easy for us to arrest others. But today, we have to do it in our own house.. Anyway, duty is duty. I will send Inspector Wagle to arrest her. No sir, it's my case. I will arrest her. Today if I would ask for anything from God, I would get it. I was thinking if you would come early then I would.. Hey! Why are you seeing? It is your fault and you are getting angry? How innocent you act, Mr. ACP. Do you know that you are going to be a father? Karuna. Karuna. Why, aren't you happy? Karuna. I have come to arrest you. - Then do it! I have come to arrest you for murdering Brij Bhushan! I did not know that the woman whom I thought of us pure.. ..was actually a promiscuous woman. Why did you play with my life? Answer me? Why are you crying, grandmother? What happened to her uncle? - Nothing, son. Uncle, why is grandmother crying? Aunty, pacify grandmother. Mother! Inspector. No! Uncle, where are you taking my aunty? Leave her alone. Where are you taking her? I will not let her go, leave her! Let her go, son. Let her go. - Leave her. Let her go. Let her go. - Leave her. Sir. Munna, come here. Uncle, they are taking her. Stop them, uncle! Aunty! Aunty! Leave her. Aunty! Aunty! Aunty! I should be highly obliged if you could send me the true copy of.. Hello! Grandpa, they've taken aunty away! - Who took whom away? The police took away aunt in handcuffs. What are you talking about? Come back soon. - Isn't your uncle there? He is there but, he is quiet and grandmother is crying. Please get my aunty back, quickly. - Okay, I'll come soon. I'll see your file tomorrow. You can go. Grandfather, the policemen have taken aunty away. - Come. How did this happen? Where is Karuna? Why don't you speak? Where is Anand? Anand. Where is Karuna? I asked where is she? Why don't you answer? That means, it all happened in your presence, with your consent. How dare you get the police here? For which crime is she arrested? She is a murderer. - What? Yes, she killed her ex-lover Brij Bhushan on the night of the wedding. Aren't you ashamed of accusing your wife? It is not a false accusation. - How can you say that? I have witnesses and evidences, She went to the hotel that night. We have a torn piece of her shawl, which she was wearing that night. We have the candle stand with which she killed Brij Bhushan. I have myself seen her fingerprints on it. I wish I would turn blind before seeing all this. - No! It is better to die than live a shameful life. No! What is the point in living life like this? People will taunt me and ridicule me if I step out. You are ridiculing yourself, on one side you are weeping for her. On other side, you are pushing her towards death. She is not innocent! - Anand. I have been associated with criminals.. ..for years more than your age! I have seen the murderers very closely, I know their behavior.. I know every act of theirs and you are teaching me about criminals? My experience says that she is innocent.. ..and I have confidence on my experience! I am coming inside. God bless you, dear. Child, don't worry about anything, everything will be fine. I'm there with you. I am here to protect you. Listen child, tell my.. ..why did you kill him did he deceive you? No, I had no relation with him. Then inspite of that, you wrote love letters to him? No, I did not write any letters to him. You did not write? - No! I see. That means, it was someone else's letter's which you went to take. Please tell me child, whose letters were they? It is necessary for me to know it, it'll always be a secret between us. No father, I have promised someone. I see. Okay child, sign here and write anything you wish. I want a sample of your writing. Brother. Mr. Deputy Commissioner of Police. These are the court orders, I have got her bail sanctioned. I have come to take her. - But please sit, brother. Don't call be brother! I don't have a brother. You ask for a remand in the court. The whole police department wants to punish an innocent girl. You can try what you want. But I will see how you can punish her? Brother. You are just on DCP, you have no relation with anyone. Karuna is not related to you? - Will you break off all the ties? Will you snatch the right to call her my daughter in law? Enough! I am taking her home. Instruct them to release her. Son. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday, eat these fruits. Eat them uncle, or else even grandmother won't eat. No mother, I don't feel like it. Jeetu, get our baggage. How did this happen? We couldn't believe it. We came here immediately. Brother, what is all this? How did you let it happen? Brother, get Karuna back. Don't shed tears for a killer. Brother, even you are blaming her? She is not at fault, she is innocent, brother. Madam, master has got Karuna madam back home. Kamla. Munna. Look whom I have got. - Aunty! Aunty. When did you come, Deepak? Kamla. Yes. - Won't you meet your sister in law? Karuna. Kamla, take her upstairs. Come. What is this? She has come back and everyone looks so sullen? She is a murderer and we are not concerned with her. I can't see it anymore.. ..I cannot bear my brother tarnishing your character. I will tell everyone that I had written those letters. I had a relation with Brij. - No, you will not say that. Why can't I? Due to my mistake, you are standing on the cross road of your life. And you want me to be a silent spectator? Try to forget your small mistake is my this big crime! Let this carry on! Nobody will ever learn the truth. Everybody's welfare lies in this! Karuna. You are not just a woman, you are a goddess! If you think she is a goddess then, build a temple for her. But she cannot live here. - Did you get this house in your dowry? I have worked hard to make this house! But now I can only sense hatred in this house. I don't want to live here myself. Come down quickly, Karuna. The injustice that you are doing with someone's daughter.. God forbid, if the same thing happens to Kamla.. ..and her in law's.. - Don't speak about Kamla. If I learn that my wife is a killer and a character less woman.. ..then I will not even go close to her shadow. You're accusing my daughter-in-law! - You are also evading the truth. Deepak is right. Didn't she write those love letters to Brij Bhushan? Didn't she go to Hotel Unique that night? If the need arises, I'll answer your question in the court. And Mr. ACP, this is Karuna's handwriting sample. Before slandering her character, match the handwriting. I have done it. - And yet.. I see. Come on, child. - Grandfather, I'll join you too. Okay. Let's go, child. Sit child! Father! Father! - What are the newspapers saying? I read it in Benaras and come back immediately. How did this all happen? Don't worry, I will try my best to prove that she is innocent. Inspite of all this, you are supporting her? You are great! I am the thankful to you. It is my duty. - Where is Anand? I am sorry. I can't invite you in. We have left this house. - What? Are you doing all this for my daughter? She is my daughter too. Please come with me. Don't refuse, I am an ordinary person.. I cannot force you. But I can plead to you. Don't embarrass me! Okay, we will go with you. Come child. I agree that Brij Bhushan tried to assault you.. ..and you killed him in self protection. But there is no eye witness to that incident. That is why, we have to prove that he could attempt an assault. Because he was a rogue and a promiscuous man. And for that, we need the girl whose letter you went to take. The entire case depends on that girl.. ..and you don't want to reveal her name? But why? How can I express my helplessness. All if know that my our people have disowned me.. ..and by disclosing her name, why should I ruin her happiness? Why should her family's honour be tarnished? So you are concerned about her happiness but not your old father? You are no concerned with the honour of our family? That's not right. I can give my life for your honour. You can give your life but to save that honour.. ..you cannot disclose your friend's name. My daughter-in-law is proven as a murderer and goes to the jail.. ..the whole city laughs at us, but you will not tell her name. I cannot tell you, father. If not for yourself, think about your husband. He is very sad, aren't you concerned about him? Think of the future of the child, who is yet to be born. Do you want the world to point to him, and say he's a killer's child? No! If I was in your place, I would kill my child. No! I thought that she would tell me the name. And I will win the case. But now I think that there is no chance. The question is not whether she killed Mr. Brij Bhushan or not? All the witness and evidences, even the accused herself,.. .. claims that she murdered him. That is why the question is that.. ..under what circumstances was a decent man.. ..like Brij Bhushan murdered? If she committed the murder in self defence.. ..then why didn't she surrender herself to the law that time? If she was innocent and true then what was the fear? Why didn't she admit her crime that minute itself? Your honor.. It is a very courageous task that a girl.. ..breaks the head if an innocent man, wounds him, kills him.. ..and very quietly comes for her own marriage. She has no fear of any law or the punishment. Inspite of knowing that her would be husband is a CID inspector. She should be applauded because after committing a murder.. ..she could live like an ideal wife with her husband and his family. And that too, not for a day or two but, for months together! And at a time.. ..when she learnt the progress of the case! But she was not affected and carried out her act of innocence. She was so smart right from the beginning.. ..that she herself didn't write her letters.. ..so that she shouldn't be caught in future. Taking advantage of that, she has stated that.. ..she had no relation with Brij Bhushan. She had gone to take her friend's love letters from him. If we agree this for sometime then it is obvious that.. ..they are very thick friends and are very close to each other. But what friendship is this that.. ..one is willing to be sentenced for life.. ..and the other one is watching her going through this problem! What friendship is it that one friend, or her wedding night.. ..to save her friend's honour, gets into trouble herself. And the other one has no desire to help her in the time of need? Isn't there any humanity within that friend? There cannot be any such friend.. ..who is willing to do this! There can't be any friend who in spite of her sacrifice is quiet! Your honor.. - Judge.. What happened? How did she fall? - She has fainted! She has fainted. We will take her home. - I'll also come. Your honour, she has fainted. I request the court to adjourn the court for sometime. Alright. The court is adjourned till 3 p.m. Thank you, your honor. Stop the car, turn it towards the office. Yes, sir. Get my personal letters file, quickly. - Yes, sir. Her pressure is very high. She has perhaps fainted due to shock. I will give her an injection. If the pressure doesn't come down we'll have.. ..to take her to the hospital. Sir, it is the master's call. What happened, aren't you feeling all right? This is Kamla's letter and here's the photo-copy of the other letter. Match both the writings. Oh no! That means, Kamla had a relation with Brij Bhushan? Yes, now do you know why he fainted. She must be going through this turmoil the day Karuna got arrested. And today in the court, when her conscience was shaken.. She couldn't bear it and fainted. You know that she is a very weak minded person. And I accused that poor girl of such a big crime? She did such a great thing for us! I am not even fit to beg for forgiveness. Yes son, she was saving our honour all this while. What will you do now? To prove Karuna innocent.. ..we will have to present Kamla in the court. What are you thinking? I am thinking, to save Kamla from being defamed.. ..Karuna went through so many problems.. .. and faced humiliation. But today it is all wasted. There is no other alternative. it is our daughter's fault. She will only have to atone for it. Hello! - Kamla is not regaining her senses, the doctor cannot diagnose. Please call some other doctor. - Okay, I will send Anand. Go home, Anand. Your mother is worried about Kamla. Mr. Mehra, do you have to speak anymore? Yes, Your Honor! My argument is not yet over. - Go ahead! The defence consul is not present perhaps his daughter.. Here, he is! Sorry. Mr. Kailash Chandra.. Please sit, so that we can proceed. Mr. Kailash Chandra. Are you alright? - Yes, yes.. Yes. Your Honor, I have come to know of a witness.. ..who can bring a twist in the case. I.. I would request the court to give me a day to present this witness. Who and where is your witness? Your honour, my witness is.. - Your Honor.. Your Honor, I have witness who can prove that.. ..the deceased Brij Bhushan was a licentious man. I request the court to permit me to present the witness. What're you doing? You're presenting a witness against the state? Don't forget that you are a government servant. Don't talk about my job. If my job creates a hindrance in the way of justice.. ..then I resign right now. Your honour, please permit my witness to give her statement. This is wrong and against the proceedings of the court. I raise a point of objection. Mr. Mehra, it's within the means of the court.. ..to take anybody's statement at anytime. Objection over ruled! Call the witness. - Thank you, your honor. What is this, Vikram? Why have you got her here? Uncle, she told me everything sometime back. When I learnt, I thought there was no other way to solve this problem. No uncle, you please take her statement. Usha. Please, uncle.. Take her statement. I will speak nothing but the truth! Your name? Usha Kapoor. Did you know Brij Bhushan? - Yes! Since when? - Since 2 years. I loved him! Did he also love you? That's what he always said. But I learnt later that he was deceiving me. How? Our love had crossed the limits of decency.. ..which an unmarried and a decent girl shouldn't do. You mean that.. - I mean that, I.. I was carrying his child. Did Brij Bhushan know this? - No, I spoke to him of marriage. But he always avoided me. I feared that my brother would learn if it. But that evening I had decided to convince him about marriage. That is why, on the 24th March evening, I went to his hotel. Which day? - 24th March. Which hotel? - Hotel Unique. What was the time. - 7.45 p.m. Your honour, please note, March 24, Hotel Unique and time, 7.45 p.m. What was he doing when you went there? - He was drinking. I again spoke about marriage and he tried to evade it. But I was persistent. If you don't marry me, I will consume poison. Oh, my God! I am fed up with all this. Go ahead and have it in your house. Don't eat my head! Brij. Usha. Darling, I am sorry. But dear, why don't you understand? I have an important work today. I am expecting an important guest. You please go home. Come on, love. - Who is it? How are you concerned? Do I have to tell you about business? Come on, darling. Be good. Come. Come on. I will not go. I know your work very well. You must have called a girl and must be cheating on her also. You must have promised marriage to her also. I will not leave! I will expose you to her. Brij. I don't know how long I was unconscious. But when I came into senses, I was feeling dizzy. I could hear noises in the other room. I saw from the key hole. - Leave me! Who was she the girl Brij was trying to molest? I tried to open the door but it was locked from outside. I saw again, but I could not see her face. I wanted to bang the door, but I stopped. I feared of being exposed and defamed. Then I saw once again.. Brij was wounded and he fell down. And when I learnt that he was dead, I was very happy. A wretched man like him should have met such an end only. Mr. Mehra.. Ms. Kapoor, you just told the court that you loved him. Can you give a proof of it? I think these photographs will suffice as evidence. You just said that he locked you in the bathroom? Yes. Then how did you come out? Did the police remove you out or the hotel staff helped you? Are you a public prosecutor? Wouldn't you know if I was helped out? Order! Give me a correct answer, how did you come out? If you see the suite number 417 of that hotel, you'll know it. The other door was fortunately open. I see. You said that you were carrying his child. Then where is that child? If it was a proof of love, it would be alive. I had been to my aunt's place, I slipped suddenly and.. If you want you can get the report from the nursing home. Any other question? That's all, Your Honor. You could have hidden your shameful story that you just said. You belong to a decent family.. ..then why did you want to get defamed? It was not easy for me to speak in the court. I had to struggle a lot with myself. But when the public prosecutor.. ..used to praise Brij's character and deeds.. I wished to get up and say that it was a lie. Don't tarnish decency by calling him decent. It was not a crime to kill a monster like Brij. It was a good deed. I feel sorry that I couldn't do it. Your witness, Mr. Mehra. I have no further question. Ms. Usha Kapoor's statement has given a new twist to this case. Which proves that the deceased Brij Bhushan was a character less man. He was fond of playing with the lives of innocent girls. And that night, if Karuna wouldn't save herself from him.. ..then she would fall prey to his lust. She did it in her self defence. That is why, this court announces Karuna innocent and releases her. Uncle, aunty has come! Grandfather has got her. Grandmother, aunty has come. My aunty has come! She is also regaining her senses. - Where is she? Downstairs! How is Kamla? - She is fine but.. how did you release Karuna without Kamla's statement? I will tell you later. Listen, Kamla wasn't exposed and the matter should always remain closed. We are not aware, do you understand? - Yes! Don't look at me, Karuna is waiting, go. Go. Karuna. I don't know how to apologise, Karuna. Don't say anything! Kamla. Kamla. - Karuna.
