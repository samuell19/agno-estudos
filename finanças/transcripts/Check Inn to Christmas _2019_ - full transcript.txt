- Morning, Julia. - Good morning. Good to see you. - Hi. - Hi. Morning. - Did I miss it? - No. Blake's running late. Oh, good. I was up late, working on the Nelson account, and then getting across town today took forever. Is it just me, or does the population of this city multiply by the second? Okay, take a deep breath, relax. You're not late. And I brought donuts. You are the best. Okay, I just want to say, whatever it is that the partners decide, I think you're an amazing lawyer, and I just love working with you. Melissa, I feel the exact same way about you, and I wish they could promote both of us to senior associate. - I know. - On the bright side, I am glad they gave us this time off. I think this is gonna be the first time since law school that I've had a real Christmas vacation. Are you heading to your family's inn? - I am. - Colorado, right? Flying out on the 15th. That sounds fun and relaxing. I wish. My dad's gonna put me to work at the inn and then volunteer our family for every event at the Christmas celebration. Oh, Christmas celebration? It's a festival Crestridge throws every year with tons of events the entire month of December. That actually sounds fun. That's one way to put it. You don't sound excited at all. No, I am. I really am. It was just more fun when I was a kid, but it will be great to see my family. Normally, they're visiting me, since I'm always working, so I know they're really excited. How about you? Are you going anywhere? No. I'm knee-deep in paperwork on the River View Estates acquisition. Deadline's early January, so I should work through the holidays. So you're not taking any time off? No. Too much to do. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. How's the Nelson case going? We were unable to secure zoning variants in Cape Cod, so we're currently looking for other property. It happens. Donut? What's the Christmas season for if not to load up on sugar and carbs? I called you both in this morning to give you an update on the senior associate position. You're both excellent attorneys and incredibly smart and capable. We're lucky to have such a hard decision. Unfortunately, Thompson is tied up with the Keller case, and we can't move forward until he's back in the office. As soon as we're able to have a partners' meeting, we'll let you know who we're promoting. It'll certainly happen before the end of the year because we need everybody on hand for the new chain store account in January. I'll let you know as soon as we know. Thank you so much, Blake. We know it's a difficult process. That it is. I was planning to go to Colorado for Christmas to see my family, but if you think it's better for me to stay here-- No, don't be ridiculous. You've earned that time off. Enjoy. I'll be in touch. - [phone buzzing] - Oops. I'd better take this. Excuse me. Well, no news is better than bad news. It's true, but I would've loved to have known before the holiday. Maybe I should stay. No. You said it yourself. Your family is so excited about your homecoming. Yeah, they are. It'll be fine. Have a great time in Crestwood. It's Crestridge. ♪♪ ["Deck the Halls"] [train horn blares] [bells clanging] You're welcome. Thank you. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - You're welcome. Merry Christmas.

[laughing] But your laptop almost wasn't, so... - Oh, my goodness. -You left it on the train. Thank you so much. I really appreciate this. Yeah, you're welcome. - Julia! - Lexi! Why were you talking to Ryan Mason? That was Ryan Mason. I thought he looked familiar. Mom's parked right over here. What did he want? Just to return my computer. I left it on the train. Was he asking you about my campaign for Christmas grand marshal? No. What do those words mean? In honor of it being the centennial, they're naming a grand marshal for Christmas celebration. Someone who exemplifies the Crestridge Christmas spirit. His brother Frank and I are the two finalists running. So my little sister could be Christmas grand marshal. - Now that is fancy. - I had to write an essay. I will vote for you. Nobody does Christmas like you do. I thought maybe Ryan was trying to get intel on my campaign. No, he was just returning this. Why are you looking at me like that? This is a big deal. It's like high school class president all over again, except this time, Frank's not gonna win. I see the Mason-Crawley feud has not dissipated. Mom! Oh! I can't believe you're here. Oh, it feels like it's been forever. You guys were just in New York this summer. Forever since you've been here. Well, it is really nice to be back. Oh, don't let your father hear you say that. He's gonna talk your ear off about why you should move home. Yeah, I'm sure. Wow. Looks like the Masons have really scaled back on decorating. Oh, I know. Your dad's pleased. He's been monitoring them like a hawk. They beat us for best-decorated business last year. Yeah, I remember. I got the call. I assume Dad's out for revenge. Oh, that's why he didn't pick you up. He and Grandma are still putting up decorations. We are going all-out on decorations this year. You go all out on decorations every year. Oh, it's different. This is Crestridge's centennial Christmas celebration. More activities, more contests. Oh, including Crestridge's first Christmas dessert bake-off, which we're hosting, by the way. Grandma must be so happy. She has been prepping recipes for months. And I forgot to tell you, they're throwing a huge centennial Christmas dance at the rec hall. That's where they're announcing the grand marshal. What do you get if you win grand marshal? A trophy and bragging rights for the next 100 years. Wow, that is pretty epic. ♪♪ ["Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"] Oh! Welcome home, honey! - Thank you, Dad. - Ah, look at you! - It's so good to see you! - Gosh! So what'd you think of the front? I think it looks great. I'm worried it's not enough. - I think it's enough. - Julia! Let me see my fancy lawyer granddaughter! Hi! Beautiful as ever. Has any city boy snapped you up yet? - Nope, not yet. - No? Slim pickings back in this town. Mom, we don't need to give Jules more reasons not to live here. Besides, you never know when she'll decide she misses us and move back. Wow, Dad. You made it a whole half-minute - before bringing that up. - Yeah, I did. I'm actually up for senior associate at the firm. Wow, that sounds big. It is. It's a lot more responsibility, and I would be on a direct track to become a partner. Then we're rooting for you. Oh, Dad, we passed by the Mason Inn. Still pretty sparse on the decorations. That's because it's not their year. It's ours. Did Mom tell you about all the great centennial Christmas celebration activities? She did. It sounds like a lot. A lot of fun, I would say! And a lot more ways to show Bill Mason we're the best. Yeah, I think I'm gonna go unpack. Or you could warm up that arm of yours. The snowball toss is tomorrow. - They still do that? - Yep. And you are a part of it. I think I would rather just watch. We'll see. So who wants to put up Christmas lights? I can't. I'm setting up bins around town for the toy drive I'm organizing. - Bye. - I'm gonna go unpack. And I need to finish updating our accounts.

Have a good day. Merry Christmas. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas to you. Wow. This is a lot of lights. Yes, it is, and I've got some more boxes coming. When the town sees what I have in mind, they're gonna be blown away. I don't know. The bakery's doing something pretty special. Hmmph! Bakery. As long as the Crawleys don't win, I'm fine with that. I've said it before and I'll say it again. This whole feud with the Crawleys is absolutely ridiculous. It is not ridiculous, all right? They started it. We were here first. They may serve breakfast, but we have a better location. I really don't think we need to worry about them. They don't really pose a threat to us. Edgestone Resorts, however, does. [scoffs] Edgestone Resorts. On the train, I was reading an interview with their CEO, Kevin Howard. He says that all their success is owed to them penetrating these overlooked and underdeveloped properties. So what happens when they come in and they set their eyes on Crestridge? Well, they already have. I said no. Sorry, what? Edgestone Resorts offered to buy the inn. When? I don't know. It was a while back. Were you not gonna tell me? I'm sorry. I didn't think it mattered, Ryan. Obviously I said no. You know I'm not gonna sell this place. I know that, but as the manager, I would like to know stuff like that. Are you not worried that they're gonna go buy another property? People don't want some big, fancy resort hotel in a town like this. This is why they come here, to get away from that. Let them have their fancy spa and their overpriced restaurants. Customers like it when they call here and an actual Mason family member takes their reservation. And I agree, but this industry is changing, and these big resorts, they're coming in with all kinds of amenities, and they can afford the public relations to market them. So I don't know. If they manage to get in here, this inn could easily fade into the background. Look, Ryan, I know you just came back from this big conference, but I run this inn the way my dad did and the way his dad did, and that's what people want, okay? You of all people know our numbers are great. We're fine. For now. Hey, I thought I heard my oldest son. Hey, Mom. Sorry, I didn't want to disturb you. You disturb me anytime. How was the conference? Uh, conference was great. We covered a lot of stuff. You know, I think I saw Julia Crawley at the train station. but I'm not sure. I barely recognized her. Wow. I haven't seen her around town in a long time. Well, there's another vote for Lexi. Didn't you two used to be friends? [laughs] Hardly. What are you guys thinking for dinner? Well, that's yet to be decided. What about Jaimie's Diner for takeout? - Yeah. - That's a great idea. Usual? All around? - Extra mashed potatoes, please. - Got it. All right. All right, let's hang these up. - Pin, Dad, pin. - Thank you. - Wear it. - You look cute in a Santa hat. ♪ Oh, we wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ Ryan Mason. Julia Crawley. Did you know it was me at the train station? Was having a hard time placing you. I did not know it was you until my sister pointed it out. Well, to be fair to both of us, it's been a long time. It has, and we didn't really run in the same social circles. You were a sophomore when I was a senior, right? Yes, much younger than you. I mean, you lettered in football, I lettered in debate. That's right, yeah. Social circles aside, we probably wouldn't have hung out much, given our dads' situation. Very true. Thank you again for returning my computer. You're welcome. Where were you coming from? New York. New York. Wow. Do you work there? I do. I'm an attorney at a corporate law firm. Look at debate team paying off. - Right? - Wow. Where are you coming in from? I was coming in from a business management seminar in Denver. - Nice. - Yeah. I got my MBA a few years ago, so now my dad thinks I'm a glorified bookkeeper. Well, I'm sure he's very glad to have you around. - Where'd you get your MBA? - Chicago. And you came back here by choice? I did. I love Crestridge. Nice mountain air, friendly faces. - Well, your family aside. - So here's your order. Thank you. Do we have extra mashed potatoes? - Yes. - Great. My dad always gets that too. I'm sorry. They have something in common? - Imagine that. - Wow. - How long you in town? - At least through Christmas. Well, Julia Crawley, I hope I accidentally bump into you again. I would like that, as long as we can keep our families out of it. One can dream. Don't forget this. My family thanks you.

Are you following me? This is a very small town. I'm just in line to get some delicious hot chocolate. So this isn't the accidentally bumping into me on purpose plan? Would you like it to be? If you must know, I am smiling because everyone here looks like they're having fun, and I think that is nice. I'm so happy to see you re-embracing your roots. Relax, it's a smile. Get some hot chocolate. I'm not signing up for the snowball toss. Hello, hello! Welcome, everyone, welcome! [cheering] For those of you just joining our festivities, I am Mayor Victoria Johnson, and welcome to the Crestridge Centennial Christmas Celebration. [cheering] Every year, folks flock to our town to participate in our Christmas traditions. And I have to say, today's event is my personal favorite, the snowball toss! In honor of it being our centennial, all the events this year will be bigger and better. So this year's snowball toss won't be an individual competition. It will be a team competition. You'll need four team members to participate. - Oh, no. - What? I can already tell what my dad's thinking. And the best part is this year's prize, kindly donated by Kevin Howard, spa day passes to Edgestone's resort hotel over in Mount Marcy! [cheering] So gather up your teams. Sign-up is closing soon. Best of luck and Merry Christmas. That's not good. What? That's Kevin Howard. He owns Edgestone Resorts. Pretty sure I know why he's here. Because he's a fan of our Christmas celebration? He's put three family inns out of business in the Rockies alone. - Julia, Julia, Julia! - Hey, Dad. - Did you hear? - I did. - Teams. - I think you, Mom, and Lexi are gonna make a great team. We need four. You're on the team. - Dad. - Come on, you played softball. You have the best arm. I played second base for one season in sixth grade. It's like riding a bike. - You remember Ryan Mason. - Of course. I assume your father will be entering. Oh, the whole lot of us. Well, good luck. May the best family win. Good luck to you as well. When you're done getting hot chocolate, we'll be over there practicing our snowball toss. Have to find your sister. Sounds good, Dad. So it's officially on. It's on. I should probably take it easy on you. Absolutely not. If anything, you're gonna want me to take it easy on you. Wow. To think moments ago, you weren't even into this. I'd better go stretch. Thought you were in line for hot chocolate. Just wanted to say hi. So still signing up after what happened last year, huh? [scoffs] May I remind you, Bill, that I have beaten you more times at the snowball toss than you have me. And may I remind you, Tim, that we have won the last three years in a row. Guess we'll have to change that. Hmm. Well, hello, my favorite innkeepers. - Hi. - Victoria. Is it true I heard that Edgestone is sponsoring the prize this year? Oh, the CEO offered. Besides, who wouldn't want a free spa day? Huh. I don't think I like him being here. Me neither. So the two of you can agree on something. Who knew? VICTORIA: First round, get as many snowballs through the holes as possible. First up, Team Mason. - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! Ready, set... [blows whistle] Good boy! Go, go, go! ♪♪ ["Joy to the World"] Oh, yes! Oh! - Everybody's hot. - That's right! Time! That's what I'm talking about! Whoo! That's right! Looks like we got a competition! Oh, yeah. Next up is Team Crawley. All right! Ready, set... [blows whistle] [cheering] That was a 50! Time! Yeah! Not bad. We currently have a tie between the Crawleys and the Masons. Why am I not surprised? To determine the winner, we need one representative from each team to throw one more snowball. For this portion of the competition, different holes are worth different points. All right, we choose Julia. Dad, are you sure? Yes, you have the best aim. That's a lot of pressure. So was law school, but you did okay there. - That's a little different. - No. - Wanna do it? - Let him do it. It's on you. Well, guess it's just you and me now. I like the odds. The odds of you losing? Ha! You're funny. That was funny. Yeah. Julia, you will go first. Okay. Go for the most points. It's worth it. Yeah, go for the big one, then you're sure to get it. SANDRA: Honey, just stay calm. Yeah! Okay, that was good! Nice shot! That was pretty good. That was good. All right, now it's Ryan's turn. Tell you what. If I miss this, will you have dinner with me? No. I wanna win this fair and square. If I make it, will you have dinner with me? How about you try, you miss, and then nobody has dinner with anyone? What do you have against dinner? - Can't say I didn't try. - Yeah, you did, you tried. [cheering] Yes! Mason's family wins. Oh, Tim, I'm sorry. I guess that makes it four years in a row, huh? Lucky shot. Hey, good game. It was a good game. Here, have one of my campaign buttons. You made buttons. Just a few to remind everyone in town that I have the most Christmas spirit. Second to me. Maybe I should've taken that dinner after all. Maybe you should have. But good game, Crawley. You too, Mason. JULIA: Yes, and the bake-off will actually be held right here in the lobby. We serve breakfast every morning from 7 to 9. There's a full list of Crestridge Christmas celebration activities in your room. - Enjoy your stay. - Thanks. You're a natural at this. Well, when you've been working the front desk since you were a kid, it's second nature. Still, you were always good at one-on-one with the guests. Maybe that's why you're a good lawyer. Your clients must love you. Unfortunately, I don't get to work directly with clients in-person these days, but hopefully that will change with the promotion. Boy, the cookies sure do go fast around here. You know what? I can't wait for everyone to experience Grandma's skills in the bake-off. GRANDMA: Thank you, dear. Dad, you guys have to come down the street. It's the Masons. They put up decorations, and it's good. It's really good. Okay, let's go. BILL: And this year, in order to win best-decorated business-- See? What did I tell you? It's not bad. What do you wanna do? Well, gotta do something. Oh, we'll do something. Let's get out of here. JULIA: I'll catch up with you in a minute. And this will be completely covered. Wow. Not too shabby. - Yeah, you like it? - It's beautiful. Little joint effort between my father and myself. He wanted every square-inch covered in lights, and some genius put all these beautiful Christmas trees everywhere. I'm assuming you are that genius. Thank you for saying so. I appreciate that. So look, he's starting to listen to your ideas after all. That's because he wants to win best-decorated business. Have you ever just been straightforward with him and told him you want more responsibility? He's well aware. When I decided to go to law school instead of working at the inn, my dad was in denial until I sat him down, and I told him that becoming a lawyer was my dream. I wanted to help people, and I hoped he would support me. And did he? Took some convincing, but I was honest with him, so that helped. Just keep trying. He listened to you about all these Christmas trees. That's because he wanted to win a Christmas light competition. Yes, according to Crawley lore, the Masons have always been quite competitive. [laughs] Oh, boy, I would love to hear more of said Crawley lore. The way my grandma tells it, you guys are entirely responsible for this feud. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. Mason lore paints it a little bit different. My great grandfather spent years of backbreaking labor working at the railroad in hopes to one day be able to save enough money to open his own inn in his favorite town. He found the perfect plot of land right by the railroad, and then Samuel Mason, your great grandpa, swooped in early, bought it out from under him and opened his own inn. - Are you gonna say anything? - You done? - Yeah. - It's a great story. - Thank you. - See, the way I hear it is my great grandfather won fair and square in that bidding war, and George Crawley just couldn't take it, got jealous, and he opened up a rival inn just to run our family out of business. And somewhere in the middle probably lies the truth. Probably so. Think they'll ever get over it? - Not in the foreseeable future. - Yep. Nice work, Mason. Have a good night, Crawley. ♪♪ - Julia! - What? Didn't you hear me calling? Come on, rise and shine, honey! I need your help downstairs. - What time is it? - It's time to get up. Dad, I worked the front desk last night. Lexi's making breakfast. Mom and Grandma are doing breakfast. We have something much more exciting! Come on, chop-chop! Lexi! What is going on? Wow, Dad! [laughs] It may not look like much, but with your help and a couple hours of work, our yard will come alive with bigger, better, and classier Christmas decorations! Is this because of the Masons' new decorations? Yes. I was thinking on too small a scale. We need so much more if we're gonna compete on the Masons' level. We don't have time. All the businesses that want to be considered for the contest have to have their final decorations up tonight, so people have time to vote before the end of the celebration. Piece of cake. I'm not gonna ask you where you got all this stuff in the middle of the night, but I am gonna ask if there's any way I don't have to help you put it together. Come on, Jules. It'll be fun! Beautiful morning air, quality time with my daughters, and best of all, a display that will make jaws drop! [laughing] Okay, so it looks like we just place these bows on the boxes, and we have a magical world of presents. Sounds like a plan. You waiting for a call? Just waiting to hear if the partners have made a decision on who to promote. - When do you find out? - That's the worst part. I don't know. Well, I hope you get it. I know how hard you have worked. Thank you. I put in 10 years at this firm, so I hope they see what I'm capable of. They gave me this time off, and part of me wonders if it was a test, and I should've stayed in case they needed anything. - And miss this? - [laughing] No, I'm happy to be home, even if it means waking up insanely early to help Dad build his Christmas paradise. You have to admit yesterday was really fun. It was. I just wish Dad didn't get so heated about the Masons. You talk like you're not part of the feud. - Because I'm not. - You used to be. I guess living outside of Crestridge has given me some perspective. This whole feud, it happened, what, three generations ago? I think we should've moved on by now. Mm-hmm. What's that "mm-hmm?" I think it's another reason. And what would that be? I saw you blushing yesterday when you were talking to Ryan Mason. I think I sense a crush. And I think you've been outside too long, and you are not making sense. Glad to see you guys are working so hard, but I need one of you to get my tape measure. It's on the check-in desk. Perfect! [laughs] I'm fine. Do it myself. Christmas grand marshal. SANDRA: All right, here's your room key. We serve breakfast from 7 to 9 in the morning. - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. - So how's decorating 2.0 going? - Don't get me started. I'm just looking for Dad's tape measure. Ah. What's this? SANDRA: Oh, it's nothing, really. Edgestone Resorts wants to buy our inn? Well, they tried, and your dad firmly said no. He'd never sell. Should we be concerned they even asked? No! I mean, look, you've seen things. The inn's doing great, especially this time of year. A lot of people come for the Christmas celebration. I'm sure that Edgestone just wants a piece of Crestridge's Christmas tourist action. You have nothing to worry about, okay? This inn has been in our family for generations. We're not going anywhere. Still, I wonder if they're asking anyone else to sell, and if they do find a property, what would that mean for us? It wouldn't be good. But it's okay. Crestridge prides itself on small-town small businesses. Now go. Finish helping your father make his decoration dreams come true. [laughs] Okay, Ryan, in the song, "Frosty the Snowman," what brings Frosty to life? - Dad? - Yes. - I love you. - I love you too. Why are you asking me about Frosty? Because the day after tomorrow is the Christmas trivia, and we need to practice 'cause I do not intend on giving up my winning streak. So what brings Frosty to life? A pipe. No! Pipe? No, it's an old silk hat. See, this is why we gotta practice. I promise I will brush up on my Frosty trivia later, but right now, I'm working on some sketches. I want you to see 'em. Think you're gonna like 'em. I'm thinking we do some kind of addition to the inn. Maybe a small gym right around here, or we can make this a sauna and spa. What do you think? Ryan, we just don't need that here. I really think we should consider adding some sort of addition. All these bigger resorts like Edgestone, they have these amenities to provide to their guests. I checked our funds. We can do this. I've priced it all out. The look and feel of this inn is classic. I just think adding on would take away from the aesthetic my grandfather built here. How would you feel about maybe converting the garage? Yeah, I'll think about it, okay? But today the name of the game is Christmas trivia, so on that note, sir, what Christmas-themed Russian ballet premiered in St. Petersburg in 1892? Nutcracker. Ah! Well done, my son. I'm so proud of you. Okay, you still need to practice though. We're gonna win! Hey. Pretty brave coming over here. You nervous somebody's gonna see us talking? No. - Should I be? - Maybe. So is this a new hobby? Taking some land measurements. Thinking about putting in a gym. Hmm. I once suggested new wallpaper for the guest rooms, and my dad looked at me like I was crazy. Ah. No, no, my dad's the exact same way. I'm going with a new tactic. Gonna show him some numbers, some visuals, try to convince him that we need to do something different to compete with the bigger resorts. Speaking of the bigger resorts, do you wanna meet me for a secret cup of hot chocolate? I have something to run by you. What if I casually bumped into you at the diner in about 10 minutes? Accidentally. - Maybe. - Maybe sounds good. Shh. ♪♪ ["Deck the Halls"] It's the same letter my dad got. Really? Yeah. Clearly Edgestone wants to build in Crestridge. So let's say they do find a property. What would that mean for our families' inns? It would be terrible. They opened up one in Valley Hill, and their B&B was closed. They opened up two in Canton, and they ran both the inns out of business. What's so special about Edgestone? They offer things that we just can't. I mean, they have entire spas, gyms, clothing boutiques, nice restaurants. So what do we do? I don't think there's anything we can do, other than just make sure that our inns are up to date as much as possible. There's gotta be something more than convincing my dad to get on social media. I'm not talking social media. I mean up-to-date amenities. What? It's a bit interesting how concerned you are about this. Yeah. This is my family. No, I know, but... don't you work for a big corporate law firm? Yes, I do. Edgestone isn't our client. Concern for small-town business is just, uh... It's an interesting career path. - That's all I'm saying. - Well, I'm sorry. I just wanted more than being stuck in this town. Is that what you think? I'm stuck here? That... came out wrong. I just-- I think you had a lot going for you in high school and after it and the world at your fingertips, and you made a choice and came back to work at the inn. I like this town. I care about the people in it. And you think I don't. Thank you for meeting me. I... I should probably go. ♪♪ [laughing] So you guys want me to quiz you on some more Christmas trivia? - After the next game. - I can't. I actually have to get things ready for the gift basket for the troops event I'm hosting tomorrow. I've been putting things together all week, and we're actually short some volunteers, so if you know of anyone... Sure. No trivia? Okay. Doesn't Lexi volunteer at the VA? - You should invite her. - I'm competing against her. Why would I invite her to my charity event? Because it's a charity event. I'm just saying you might be surprised. I never once saw you try to be friends with Julia while we were growing up. Where's this coming from? We don't know them all that well, so... don't judge too quickly. All right, I'll think about it. SANDRA: Tim, there are too many lights. TIM: It'll be fine! [laughing] Of course, Mrs. Aspinwall. Just let me know if you need anything else. [thud] [thudding continues] [thud] [thud] What are you doing? I was knocking. With snowballs? Yeah. Do you wanna come down? It's late. Can always keep knocking. I'll be right there. What are you doing? My whole family's inside. Yeah, yeah. I didn't have your number, so... I wanted to apologize about what happened back at the diner. Probably I shouldn't have said some of that stuff. I'm sorry too. I forgive you. [laughs] Are you busy right now? Like right now? Yeah, are you free? I'm free. I am. I am free. Perfect. I know a great little place we can go. Would you like to? Okay. Let's go. Here's my famous hot chocolate. - Ah, thank you, Eddy. - Thank you. You're very welcome. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. This place hasn't changed a bit. Did you know this is the first building in Crestridge? - Wow. - They actually measured once. Eddy's Pub is smack dab in the center. That's impressive. It's a beautiful property, all this old brick. You should see the rooftop. The view of the lake, it's incredible. I've been telling Eddy he needs to open up a rooftop bar. You do have a good mind for business. Wow. Thank you. I'm sorry I said what I did about you staying here. Sorry for questioning your concerns. You know, after I got my MBA, I actually worked at a small startup tech company in Chicago. I didn't come right back home. I did not know that. I hated the crazy hours and the insane workload, and not to mention the fact I never got to work with an actual person, so after about a year, I decided I'd had enough. But here at the inn, I get to work with the guests one-on-one and see that even the small things I do, they matter to people. I get it. My job right now is mostly law books and paperwork. I'm hoping this promotion I'm up for will lead to more human interaction, but it's also gonna mean longer hours and even less of a life. Maybe our great grandfathers knew how fulfilling it was to help people one-on-one. That's why they built the inns. Maybe. Or maybe it was the end of the First World War, and recreational activities were on the rise, and they saw the economic potential of a small mountain town vacation spot. Yeah, there's that too. I've actually been thinking a lot about what you said about how you wished there was more that we could do to keep Edgestone out of Crestridge. I wanna do more. We could write a strongly-worded letter telling Edgestone to stay away. I was thinking more of a keep-out sign. What about the snowball toss and the person who-- Wait a second. That could actually be it. Right, you should definitely challenge Kevin Howard to a snowball fight. No, our fathers. Their natural competitiveness. What if we could get them to join forces against Edgestone? - Yeah, that could work. - It's easier said than done. We're talking about a century-long feud here, but... If anyone could do it, it's us. Really? Yeah, it'd be great. You're great, I'm great. We'd be great together. I mean, we could work great together. That's what I meant. Got it. - Yeah. - Yeah. So what do we do? We get our families together, right? We need to help them see how much they have in common. [laughs] Um, well, unless you plan on taking all of them and locking them up in a room against their will, I think that's a tricky idea. What about trivia night? Everyone's gonna be here. Way too competitive. That's when they're at their worst. Right. Or we could see if they wanna volunteer to make gift baskets for the troops tomorrow. Love it. I'll rally the troops to help the troops. Let's do it. - Cheers. - Cheers. To making miracles happen. Hello, sweetie. Grandma, hey. What are you doing up? I was going to ask you the very same thing. I just went out on a little walk. In the middle of winter in December? Well, I can't get nature like this in Manhattan. Join me for a cup of peppermint tea? Sure, thank you. Did I ever tell you about your Great Aunt Elizabeth? Just that she lived in California. She was a lot like you. Ambitious, hard worker. She used to sneak in and out of that very door too. She sneaked out to go see the man she was in love with. His name was John Mason. When your great grandfather found out about it, he told her she had to break it off immediately. It was a betrayal to the family. Did she? No. She loved him. So what happened? She asked him to move away with her, and he said no. He couldn't leave his family or the town. And so he ended it. Broke her heart. She moved away not long after. The last thing I want is for you to have a broken heart. Grandma... this is nothing like that. I live in New York, and I know I can't get attached to anyone here. And you know that I've always wanted to be a partner in a good firm. I will not let anything or anyone jeopardize that. Good. But I do think it's time we leave the past behind us. Oh, that's hard to do. The past doesn't like to let go. Or maybe we don't like to let go of it. But Christmas is known for its miracles. - Good morning. - Hey! Huh! Well, look who decided to wake up. - I fell asleep late. - For the record, I saw Dad outside your room this morning with a blow horn, but I talked him out of it. And you are the best sister ever. We're just so excited to have you home, we wanna spend every minute with you. Then you should come with me today to make Christmas gift baskets for the troops. That's at the Mason Inn. Yes, it is, and I hear they could use some extra hands. You know how much I love the cause, but we have Christmas trivia tomorrow. We need to study. Dad, it's Christmas trivia. How much do you need to study? Well, I overheard Eddy yesterday in the library, asking the librarian about Crestridge Christmas history. I'm thinking it's gonna be its own category, so we need to brush up. Isn't that cheating? It's not cheating. It's additional information that may or may not be pertinent. Well, I think making Christmas gift baskets for the troops is a great idea. Julia, I'll join you. Mom, the Masons are hosting. So? Christmas is about giving just as much as it is receiving. Doesn't matter who's in charge. You're right. And I do love making a good gift basket. Just leaves you, Dad. I think that I can volunteer some of my time. For the troops. For the troops! How's everyone doing? You need anything? Can I get some more of these? [humming] How? How did you do this? How'd you get them together? The hard part's gonna be getting your dad to be okay with it. Uh-huh. You put the cookies on the side there. Actually can fit more in the basket. I think I know how to put things in a basket. - Here we go. - Let's just give them time. - Rome was not built in a day. - Mm-hmm. It's been a century. How much time do they need? Can I have that deck of cards? - Thank you. - Thank you. What about them? Shocked you came. Well, it's a good idea. I've been organizing a toy drive. Yeah, I've seen the bins around town. Nice work. Thank you. What was that? I think that is what we call hope. - Hope. Oh, right. - [chuckles] - Looks good on 'em. - There's always hope. There we go. All right, let's put these boxes in the back. Right there. Yeah, that's good. They'll appreciate it, the soldiers. Think so. Did you ever serve? Uh, no. My dad did. World War II. Yeah, same. Before he took over the inn. Yep. Good man. Definitely. I hope we're doing them proud. Tomorrow at the trivia... Just so you know, I've been studying, so you're gonna be in trouble. [laughs] Just a heads-up. I overheard Eddy talk to the librarian about Crestridge Christmas history. I'm thinking it might be a category. Well, it's good to know. Yeah, you know, even playing field. Yeah. Well, good luck... 'cause you're gonna need it. Same to you, buddy. [laughing] Hello, everyone, and welcome to one of our celebration's most popular events, Christmas trivia. - [cheering] - Yes! Winners, of course, will receive one month of free drinks right here at Eddy's Pub. Oh, boy, that's gonna cost you. Thank you, thank you. And now, without further ado, the host of Christmas trivia for the last 10 years, pub master Eddy. - [cheering] - Yay, Eddy! Who's ready for Christmas trivia? [cheering] ♪♪ ["Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"] Moving on to our big category round: Crestridge Christmas history. You got this. And the winner of this year's Christmas trivia is... the Crawley Family. [cheering] Before you get back to your meals, I have one more announcement. This will actually be my last Christmas celebration here in Crestridge. - What? - Oh, no. I know, I know, but my daughter just had my first grandkid, and I want to retire and move back to Florida and be closer to them. - Oh, congratulations, Eddy. - That's great. We are so sorry that you are retiring. Who's gonna be taking over the pub? Actually, I decided to sell the place. The entire strip of businesses, in fact. - Sell it? - Yeah. Edgestone Resorts made me a great offer. - Edgestone? - You-- You what? Edgestone Resorts? Edgestone? Oh, God. What are we gonna do about this? [sighing] - This is bad. - Very bad. They could run my family out of business. Mine too. So we need to do something and fast. We still need to work on getting them on the same page. They can stand up to Edgestone. There's power in numbers, and both families are facing the exact same problem. I agree, so we need to get them to come together as a team. Yeah. Is your family participating in the bake-off? No. They're scared of your grandmother. Great. I have an idea. How could Eddy sell to them? They made him a good offer. There you are. Did you win? Yeah. Well, you don't look like you did. Edgestone Resorts is buying Eddy's Pub. Oh, dear. Yeah. They're just gonna tear down the entire building and put in one of their cookie-cutter resorts. There's plenty of time to worry about this later. Bake-off is tomorrow, and I need all hands on deck for my buche de noel. I'm on it. My first year running the inn, we had a really slow season. I was afraid we were gonna have to close. But guess what. We pulled through. The Crawleys always do. Hmm? It'll be okay. I know. Best thing to do when life gets hard? Bake something really good. All right. And this one. Lexi, could you go get those utensils? - Mm-hmm. - There you go. I'll start on the dry ingredients. [crackling] Yeah! Okay. Uh-oh. That's not good. They-- They might come back on. Well, it's the entire inn. I told you there was one too many electric things in the yard. Those things are gonna win us the best-decorated business award. Not if they short-circuit our power, they're not. We're hosting the bake-off tomorrow. I'll get the backup generator running, cover the guest rooms, then I'll call the electrician, have him out here first thing in the morning. But what about my buche de noel? Can you just make it tomorrow before the bake-off? This dessert requires time, patience, and precision. So no. Found some extra candles. We need much more than candles to bake. Why don't we just use somebody else's kitchen? Who else would have the space we need this time of night? The Masons. You suggesting we just call 'em up and ask to use their kitchen? Well, Dad did Bill a favor by giving him a heads-up on trivia. I don't know. This is different. Doesn't the generator cover all the guest rooms? So the guests will be fine, and there's a night clerk on duty if anyone needs anything. Son, I have to do this. Edna Harrington and I agreed that this bake-off would be the final say on who is the superior baker. Fine. I will call them. [doorbell rings] - Merry Christmas! Welcome! - Merry Christmas. Thank you, thank you very much. - You guys are lifesavers. - This is great. How much counter space do you have? The normal amount? - Does that work? - Yes. Oh, here, let me help you with that. Thanks. Don't be so surprised. I'm actually not a bad guy. Never said you were. - Power outage? - Yep. - Do I ask? - Nope. Okay. This is wonderful. Thank you so much. What exactly is a buche de noel? It's a rolled sponge cake filled and frosted with chocolate buttercream. Ah, it's a yule log cake then. TIM: Buche de noel. Our ancestors were French. It seems complicated to me. It is. I mean, that's why it's going to win. I think we got this covered, if you guys wanna do something else. Did you show Mr. Crawley the new pool table? Wait, you got a pool table? Yeah, yeah, customers love it, yeah. Dad, you've been talking about getting a pool table for a long time. Yeah, you two should play. You don't need us here? No, I think we got it. Mr. Mason? I get the impression they want us to leave. Yeah, I'll show him the pool table. When did you get a pool table? They don't belong in here. It goes faster if you whisk it up higher. Oh, actually, given the separation of the cream, it's more flavorful if you alternate. Fun fact. Yay! - Chef's gotta taste as he goes. - All right. - Mmm! - Yeah? - That's pretty good. - That's really good. - Here, try this. - Ah. I'm not usually an eggnog guy, but this is delicious. Right? Special ordered. Well, looks like business is going well. Yeah, very well. You? - Yeah, yeah. - Good. I can't believe they got to Eddy. Yeah, tell me about it. I guess Edgestone had to look elsewhere after I turned them down. - They made you an offer? - Yeah. Us too. You worried? I don't know. You? Yes, actually. I don't get what's so great about these big, fancy resorts. Exactly, I mean, they're all the same. - Yeah. - Cookie-cutter. No character. At least our inns reflect the flavor of this town. Exactly, yes! - Right? - Yeah. Do you know what you're gonna do? No. You? [scoffs] No. If you like it, don't forget to vote. - Enjoy. - Merry Christmas. You're gonna love it. Man, I'm already so full, and we still have half the samples left. I know. I should've paced myself. Did you try the hot chocolate cupcakes? No, I've been too busy with these cream horns. - Okay, I'm done. - You're done? - That's all you. - Okay. I just wish you'd told us first, Eddy. A resort like that could put us out of business. I was thinking it might do the opposite. You know, bring in more tourists. The more tourists, the better for all the business here. Have you signed anything yet? Is this a done deal? No. I just got the paperwork. Hey, y'all. What are we talking about? Just discussing the sale. Hey, more hot chocolate, anyone? - No, thanks, thanks. - I'm going to get some. Did you know about this? Well, I knew that Kevin Howard had been spending more time here, but I didn't know that Edgestone officially made an offer. This changes a lot. I know you're both concerned, and I get it, but a big hotel like this may allow for growth. Besides, these days, people expect a lot out of their lodging. - Like a spa. - Yeah, or a gym. That's what I hear. Ooh, excuse me a second. Melanie just put out reindeer tarts. One hundred years. Just like that, could be over. VICTORIA: Hello, everyone! [applause] [cheering] I don't know about y'all, but I am full. [laughter] The votes are in, and I have the winners of our first Crestridge Centennial Christmas Celebration Dessert Bake-off. Oh, that is a mouthful. [laughs] And our first-place winner is... the Crawley family's buche de noel! [cheering] Actually, we had some help. So technically, it's the Crawley-Mason family buche de noel. Well, other than Edgestone coming in and trying to ruin the town, I'd say that was a pretty big success. I'd say we make a pretty great team. [groans] There's a step there. - I missed that step. - You did miss that step. It's a shame this is just for the centennial. I think they should do this every year. Well, then I would have to come home for Christmas a lot more often. Or maybe a little more often than that. I would like that. Hey, Jules, have you seen-- Um, never mind, never mind. Was that your sister? That was my sister. Okay. I should go. - I'll take care of that. - Take care of that. - Good night. - Good night. [door closes] Uh, were you and Ryan just... Are you guys a thing? [phone ringing] I have to take this. You're not getting out of this. Hey, Melissa, what's up? Hey, sorry to interrupt your vacation. No, it's okay. I just wanted to let you know Thompson's back, and he just called a meeting with the partners tomorrow. He did? Yeah, this could be it. I mean, I don't know if they're gonna discuss the promotion or anything, but I just wanted to give you a heads-up in case they call. Okay. Thank you. Let me know if you hear anything else. I will. Bye, Julia. Talk to you soon. ♪♪ ["Up on the Housetop"] I hope you had a great day. Merry Christmas. If you need any celebration recommendations, you let me know, okay?

No, no, no, you can never have enough wreaths. Let's do it. I'm down. Thank you, Grandma. You're welcome, dear. It's beautiful. You're right, honey. Sweet little baby pinecones. I'm gonna go get you a hot chocolate. Honey, you're right. Those are lovely. Wow! You can make your own wreaths. That sounds fun. I wanna give that a try. Oh, look, it's the Crawleys. You guys care to join us? What perfect timing. We were just saying we were hoping to make a wreath. - Yeah? Please, yes, join us. - Can I get your chair? Thank you. So, Tim, you have any experience making wreaths? I majored in wreath-making. - You? - If I weren't an innkeeper, I'd be a professional wreath maker. [laughs] So no clue? No clue at all. Now, does a wreath have to be round? I have the same question. I think that is just a garland. Hmm. I think I'm gonna go with a garland. I love a good garland. I'm gonna go see if Grandma has silver ribbon. Real quick, before you get to your ribbon thing, um, something I wanted to ask you. Ask away. The dance is tomorrow night, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me. Before you say anything about our families not getting along, I want you to look over there and look what we've accomplished. That is all our efforts right there. That's hard to do. I was gonna say I would love to. Oh. Okay. Pick you up at 6:00? Preferably on a horse and sleigh. Like a one-horse open sleigh? [laughs] I'm kidding, obviously. I think I could make it happen. BILL: We're centrally located. People like that. And we have dining options for our guests, which is more important. Let's go see. So what's going on? - [sighs] - With Edgestone coming in, I was just saying more likely than not, only one of our inns will survive. I agree, and it will be ours. No, it'll be ours because we were in Crestridge first. First? By one month, and only because you took the property next to the railroad station. We bid on that property fair and square. We have way more rooms. Ryan has a lot of new ideas. He wants to add a gym onto the place, so... This is ridiculous. It's all speculation. You know, it is ridiculous because if one of us is gonna close, it will not be the Mason Inn. - I think we'd better go. - No, we're going. Dad, I'm sure we can work this out. No, I know how he feels, and he has always thought that his inn is better. Well, I guess we'll find out whose closes first. Fine. Honey! That went well. Maybe we're kidding ourselves. This rift is too deep. So close. Very close. We still on for tomorrow? Yeah, but it's probably best if I just meet you there. Hey, here's a wreath for our sleigh. See you tomorrow. Dad. This is our home. Yes, it is. - I can't lose it. - You won't. I might. Four generations have survived. And now some resort could just take it all away? Dad... Maybe it's time I just face the facts, stop running from reality. We don't stand a chance against an Edgestone Resort. There has to be another way. Nothing you need to worry about. You got a good thing going on in New York. Just because I don't live here anymore doesn't mean this isn't my home. Being back here, it's made me realize this will always be my home. And we can't lose it. ♪♪ Hmm. Hello? Is anybody here? - Hello? - Hi. Julia. Is Ryan here? Yeah, he should be in the kitchen. Do you mind if I go back there? No, no, that's fine. Thanks, Mr. Mason. Bill, please, call me Bill. Thanks, Bill. Hey. How did you get past the guard? Friendly smile. Which you do have. Do you want a sandwich? No, I'm good, but thank you. I have an idea that I think can keep Edgestone Resorts out of Crestridge, but it's a little out there, and I'm gonna need your help to make it work. Go. I went and talked to Eddy. I looked over the contract. We can offer him more money. He could terminate the sale. Well, I don't know about you, but we don't have enough to buy the entire strip. We don't either on our own, so I was thinking what if our families go in on this together? I'm sorry, you want our families to buy a property together? Yes, I do. And what would we do with it? We would turn it into an upscale hotel together. We'd offer everything that the resorts have. A spa, a gym, a restaurant, but with a family touch that the Masons and Crawleys bring. We could convert that second floor to some more rooms, maybe add another level, take advantage of the view. - I like this. - The back wall goes, could add more amenities there. And that is brilliant. This could be the place that tourists are looking for when they come to Crestridge, and they want that more luxurious accommodation. Exactly, and if they want the family experience, they could stay in one of our original inns. Yeah, it's a win-win. Right? However... Okay, let's say, hypothetically, miraculously speaking, our fathers set aside this feud, and they joined forces to buy this hotel, and they outbid Edgestone, what's to say that Edgestone's not just gonna go buy up another property and put their resort there? Gives us time to implement this. What is this? I got this idea from Cape Cod's newest law that blocked one of our clients. It's an amendment to the town's zoning laws. It requires every business to obtain a permit and a site plan approval from a board made up of local business owners. That way, if any corporation tries to come in, our town has a say in it. Oh, you're good. Do you think we can sell this to our parents? We have to convince them that it's worth it. I was thinking we could bring it up tomorrow night at the dance. Everyone's gonna be there. It's neutral territory. Okay. I'll come up with a business plan and a good budget. And I will write up a contract that shows it's an equal partnership. You know, before you walked in here, we didn't have this much work. ♪♪ [phone ringing] Hello? Julia, hi. I know you're home with the family, but do you have second? Yes, of course. Is everything okay? Very much so. I'm calling with good news. We wanna offer you the senior associate position. That is incredible. We love the work you were doing last year, and we think you would be an asset to our senior-level team. Thank you. It was a hard decision, but your skill set and your ability to think outside the box solidified it for us. Thank you so much. I really wanted this. Now we're gonna hit the ground running with the chain store account on January 2nd, so we would love it if you'd get back a little earlier. Maybe right after Christmas to start getting things in order. Sure, yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. Perfect. Congrats, and I'll see you soon.

[cheering] During our first celebration back in 1919, locals and guests alike would gather together for a dance, and tonight we bring back this tradition. [cheering] But before I let you dance the night away, it is time to announce our Christmas grand marshal, a person who exemplifies our town's values and the spirit of Christmas. So without further ado, this year's first Crestridge Christmas grand marshal is... Lexi Crawley! [cheering] - Whoo! - Lexi! Thank you. Thank you so much. I have lived in Crestridge my entire life, and I firmly believe there's no better place on Earth, especially to celebrate Christmas. And Christmas isn't about awards. It's about family and who you share it with, so I share this with my family, the Crawleys, and of course with all of you, my Crestridge family. Thank you and Merry Christmas. [cheering] Congratulations. You're a worthy opponent. Thank you. - This might be a good time. - Yeah, I think you're right. Congratulations.

So I just got back from talking to the Crawleys. Oh, boy, how'd that go? Well, it actually went pretty well. We're gonna do it. We're gonna buy Eddy's place together and open up the Mason-Crawley Hotel. Actually, he wants to call it the Crawley-Mason Hotel, but that's clearly a terrible name, so maybe we'll call it the Crestridge Hotel just to play it safe. Really? Are you serious? Yeah! I mean, the business plans that you and Julia showed us, well, they were so strong, we just couldn't say no. I don't know what to say. That is fantastic. Um, you know, if it's okay, I would love to discuss maybe the possibility of me running this venture. Oh. Really? Yeah. This is the opportunity I've been waiting for. I know I could take a place like that, make it a state-of-the-art destination hotel and also keep the traditional customer services and the personal touches that we've put on our inn. Well, it's funny because... I think I just said that exact same thing to Tim, that you'd be the perfect person to oversee this whole operation. You did that? I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, son, but... I do listen. I'm proud of you son. Come here. [laughs] - That's great. - Yeah. I heard Julia's going back to New York, huh? Yeah, yeah, she is. She got the job that she wanted. I know you two were getting close. Feud's over. That's great. That's right. I'm sure we'll get in some scrapes in the future, but we both care about the community, and if setting aside a century-old feud is what's best for our inns and for the town, then so be it. Yeah, so be it. You look lost in thought. It's just so peaceful here. I don't think I really appreciated that when I was growing up. You don't appreciate much of anything when you're young. That's one of the best parts about growing up. You grow wiser. You told me to be careful not to get my heart broken. I did. And I thought I was. I always knew I would be going back, that this was the job I wanted, and now it's the thought of leaving here that makes my heart break. Our family and the Masons are going into business together. [laughs] And that's all thanks to you. This Christmas, you did something that no one else in this family has ever been able to do for generations: Bring us all together. Thank you. - Hey, partner! - You made it. Are you kidding? For years, I've been hearing about how amazing your Christmas breakfast is, and now I'm finally invited. [laughing] Hey, I am happy to hear both of you are buying Eddy's land. - Yeah, so are we. - Yup. And I'm really excited to see how you decorate next Christmas. The two of you got tons of votes for best-decorated business. So who won? You can say it. Go ahead. - The bakery. - What? They used actual crystals to refract their lights through. I'll announce it in a bit. - [sighs] - Runner-up? Can't really beat real crystals, I guess, huh? No, no, you can't. But you came pretty close. Gave me a run for my money. No. Your place looks great too. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Tim. Mind if I join you? Good morning, Grand Marshal. Well, it's a big job, but someone's gotta do it. Yeah. But seriously, congratulations. You earned it. Thank you. After breakfast, I'm gonna go deliver all the toys I collected. I could use a hand. I would love to. Tim, where's Julia? She didn't leave, did she? No, no. Oh, you just missed her. She had to take care of something, and she told me to give you this. Thank you. Hey. So what do you think of the Mason-Crawley Hotel? I think you mean the Crawley-Mason Hotel. [laughs] Missed you this morning. I had a few things I needed to take care of. Gotcha. I wanted to meet you here because this is where you first got me thinking about what really matters, about how life is more fulfilling when you see the impact you have, and I see what we were able to do for our families. That's pretty special. So I called my boss, and I told him that I'm not taking the promotion. I have decided to open up my own law firm right here in Crestridge. Helping our families made me realize that this town could use a good attorney. And the best part is I made partner right away. You serious? You wanna stay here? I do. There's something about this town that... just makes me wanna stick around. Maybe some indefinable quality you just can't put into words. No, I can put it in words. Oh, I'm sure you could.
