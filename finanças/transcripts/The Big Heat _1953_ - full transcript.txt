(GUNSHOT) (CAR PASSING OUTSIDE) Mr. Lagana. I know it's late. Wake him up. Tell him it's Tom Duncan's widow. I'm very sorry, Mr. Lagana but there's an important call on the private line. A woman who says she's Tom Duncan's widow. - Widow? - That's what she said. Yes? This is Lagana. No, I'm glad you called me, Mrs. Duncan. I appreciate it. Yes, of course, we will get together. But now I suggest you call the police immediately. Call Vince. Mr. Lagana wants Vince Stone. It's his girl. She says he's playing cards. This is not a social call, Debby. Tell Vince I want him. Right away. Oh, sure, Mr. Lagana. I always like to tell Vince you're calling. I like to see him jump. Vince. It's him. I'll pass the deal, huh? Why don't you shut the door and see if anybody needs a drink? Well, I don't know about your politicians, but I'm so bored I need one. Two. Debby! Shut the door! Yes, Mike? Well, I didn't know it was the private line ringin' or I would've answered it myself. When? When did it happen? Oh sure, I'll see to it. Too bad you had to make the trip out from headquarters, Sergeant. From out of bed, you mean. When a cop kills himself, they want a full report. - Did you know him? - No, just to say hello to. He was in charge of the Record Bureau. Single contact wound. Powder burn on his temple and right hand. Suicide, no question. Tell the wagon boys they can have him, huh? Yes. - No note or anything, huh Gus? - No. Nothing. Better make a list of all this stuff for the report, huh? Right. I'm going upstairs to have a talk with Mrs. Duncan. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Please, come in. Mrs. Duncan? I won't keep you very long. You needn't apologise. I know this is necessary. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. My name is David Bannion. I knew your husband slightly. Tom had many friends. Would you mind telling me what happened? When I first heard the shot, I was too surprised to move for a few seconds. Then, I ran downstairs. When I found him, he was... He was dead. (SOBBING) I'm sorry I have to ask you these questions but they want a full report downtown. Of course. When a policeman kills himself, the department gets worried. That depends on the circumstances. There weren't any circumstances. Everything Tom ever did was clean and wholesome. That's the kind of man he was. Do you know why he took his life? It must have been his health. Several times the past few months, he complained about a pain along his left side. When I suggested he see the police surgeon he'd make excuses. I think he was afraid to. Then he didn't see a doctor? Not that he ever told me. You've been most helpful. Now look, if there's anything you need, anything at all, you get in touch with us, huh? Thank you, Mr. Bannion. Goodbye, Mrs. Duncan. What's with dinner? How about putting the paper down and helping? All right. Whoops! Hey... - Is that steak? - Medium-rare. How do you manage steaks on my salary? Y'know, downtown they just don't believe me. Tell them you married an heiress. All right. Next year, when Joyce starts kindergarten, you're gonna have to kiss the steaks goodbye until she finishes college. Unless you become Police Commissioner in the meantime. Hmmm, that's inevitable. Oh, naturally. Okay, Commissioner, you get the stringy end of the steak. Hey what about Joyce? She go to bed all right? Just the usual tug of war. She had to go to the bathroom a few times, hear three stories and have a glass of water before she finally went to sleep. She's angelic all day, but at night she's a holy terror. That's the way I usually describe you. Hey, that's what the book says, though, doesn't it? "Be patient, but firm." The book, the book. Very scientific and calm. Trouble is, the authors have never met our daughter. It's very simple. She's madly in love with me, that's all. Hey, you know somethin'? That's the conflict between the two of you. You're both in love with the same wonderful guy. - Right? - Wrong. We're just used to you. Well? How is it? - It's good steak. - Thanks. - You want some beer? - I'll take a sip of yours. You see, that's exactly what I mean. It's the perfect marriage. We share the same scotch, the same cigarette, the same can of beer. Among other things. Hey, you know something? I'm going to drink mine and take a sip of yours. That'll be something different for a change, huh? - (PHONE RINGING) - Oh, they'll wake Joyce! Hello? He's having dinner. Oh. It's Sergeant Kahn. Hello, Marty. Y... Wha...? Who says Duncan didn't kill himself? I saw the body, Marty. There's no question about it being suicide. All right, what's her name? All right, I'll go see her. (BAND PLAYING) Is Lucy Chapman around? The last stool on the other end. Lucy Chapman? - Yeah. - I'm Bannion, Homicide. Oh. With this band playing, you need megaphones to talk at the bar. - We can sit in a booth. - All right. Okay, what is this information you have? This story is all wrong, Mr. Bannion. Why, Tom wouldn't kill himself. He wasn't worried about his health. Not for a single minute. No? Then what was he worried about? Nothing. Nothing at all. Not after his wife agreed to divorce him. Duncan told you he was getting a divorce? He talked about nothing else. - When was this? - Night before last. My night off. What will it be, folks? Oh, you don't have to order anything. That's all right, I'll have a beer. - What about you? - Only when I'm working. How'd you get to know Duncan? Well, I met him a year ago. A year last May 11 th, down on Lakeside. Tom owned a summer place there. I liked him right away. He was a real wonderful guy, Mr. Bannion. Nice and gentle. Thirty-five, mister. Pay now. Thank you. Tom used to come to the club every night. His wife travelled a lot. Sometimes, when she was away, I... I used to go to the house. We'd go swimming and then lie around in the sun. That sounds very cosy. Oh, it wasn't that way, Mr. Bannion! Oh, sure. Sure. Please, please you gotta to believe that. You've gotta understand how things were with Tom. How he was caught between the two of us. Between me and that... That leech he was married to. What's your pitch, Lucy? Trying to use us for a shakedown? Shakedown? Me? Sure, I understand. You're covering up for a cop's widow! You don't want anything that'll change her story. I wanna find out facts. Oh, in a pig's eye, you want facts! The only difference between me and Bertha Duncan is that I work at being a B-girl, and she has a wedding ring and a marriage certificate. - That'll be all. - Maybe for you. - I can still talk to the newspapers. - Yeah, I know. You can talk yourself into a lot of trouble. So what? At least I'll show she's a liar. Tom had no reason to kill himself. The fact is he did kill himself, and that's positive. Can I have a brandy? Well, she claims she saw your husband a few nights ago, Wednesday night, and there was nothing wrong with his health. What are you trying to say, Mr. Bannion? I... Just trying to check up on her story. Find out why your husband took his life. Maybe I've been trying too hard to keep our dirty family linen from being washed in public. I suppose that woman told you about their relationship? She said your husband was in good health and very cheerful, Mrs. Duncan. And that you'd agreed to divorce him. She's a liar! Tom never wanted a divorce. And he wasn't a well man. I have no choice, now, except to tell you about Tom and myself. In the years we were married, there were four Lucy Chapmans. Four that I found out about. Tom was vain. He had to prove to himself that he was still attractive to women. Maybe he did boast to that woman that he was in good health. What else would you expect him to do? I wish this visit hadn't been necessary. There's a chance Lucy Chapman might try a little blackmail. She knows you own that house at Lakeside. Probably thinks you're wealthy. A wealthy policeman would be a novelty. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Bannion. There's one small thing I'd like to clear up. You know, so there'll be no loose ends. Of course. Would you mind telling me about the house at Lakeside? When it was bought, price that was paid, small details like that? I'd mind very much. For Tom's sake, I resent the implication of your questions. Look, Mrs. Duncan, there was no implication. Lucy Chapman may run to the newspapers and it's my job to have the material to offset any insinuations that she might make. And it's my job, with Tom dead and defenseless, to preserve his good name the best way I can. Goodnight, Mr. Bannion. Goodnight. POLICEMAN: So long. Here you are, sir. Trouble automatically catches up with girls like her. Looks like a sex crime to me. You said she wasn't attacked. Oh, that's not unusual in this type of case. I'd say pretty definitely it was psychopathic. You saw those cigarette burns on her body. Yeah, I saw them. Every single one of them. What's that name again, Sergeant? Miss Chapman. Lucy Chapman. Hey, the Lieutenant's been buzzing you every ten minutes. He didn't say what for. (TAP RUNNING) Sit down, Dave. I had a call from upstairs. What have you been bothering Mrs. Duncan about? Just routine. The first time was, not the second visit. Did she complain? Somebody did. It was bad judgment to bother a cop's widow about the love life of her husband. Good or bad, it was my judgement. You're missing the point. I'm the one that gets the pressure calls from upstairs. I'm the one who has to explain. You don't keep an office like this very long stepping on a lot of corns. You want me to go upstairs and explain? Not you. You're a corn-stepper by instinct. No, all I'm asking you to do, and I'm not even ordering it, Dave, stop bothering Mrs. Duncan. I don't wanna jam you up Ted, but I may have to see her once more. Why? You any doubt Duncan killed himself? No, none at all. But I just got back from the county morgue. Hmm, the barfly? I read the teletype about your identification. Lucy Chapman used to be Duncan's girlfriend. And the Army's and Navy's. Yeah, maybe so. She talks to me, just once, and, like that, she's dead. That's County Homicide's headache. Let's worry about this office. We're spilling over with unfinished business. Lucy Chapman was probably trying to shake down some sucker who wouldn't shake. When barflies get killed, it's for any one of a dozen crummy reasons, you know that. Let the Sheriff's Office sort out this jigsaw. Meanwhile, we'll stop pestering the widow. Okay? You still asking? No more. I'm telling you. First I know Lucy's quitting is about two in the morning. She comes to me and asks to be paid off. - Did she say why? - I don't ask. All any of these dames owe me is a night's work, one night at a time. They come and go like flies. Only this fly got herself strangled. These things happen, Sergeant. Outside of my place, some of these babes keep pretty shady company. It figures. They know nobody cares much what happens to 'em. She have any close friends among the other girls here? They don't stay long enough to make friends. Where did she live? If I ask for an address, they lie. It's not worth the bother. They're floaters. Not much more than a suitcase full o' nothin' between them and the gutter. Hey, y'know somethin'? You ought to be doing radio commercials. How to talk a lot and say nothin'. Why, I'd be tickled to help if I could. Sure. When I get some answers, I'll be back. Glad to see you anytime, Sergeant. This is Tierney. Tell him it's important. Sorry to bother you. Bannion just left here. No, sir, I just gave him a lot of double-talk. He said he'd be back again. Yes, sir, I will. Okay, buster, who'd you call? My mother. Would you rather go downtown to answer the questions? Don't scare me, Sergeant. Five minutes after we get downtown, you'll be answering the questions. - Get your coat. - Sure. Only somebody'll wanna know why you're butting into a County case. Why you don't stop annoying people. Especially after you've been told once. You get your news fast, don't ya? Special carrier pigeon. Do we still go downtown? No, not today. When we do, I'll have enough answers to close this joint up. Tell that to your mother. That's the most beautiful castle in the whole world. It's a police station, Daddy, just like yours. Hello, little bossy. Where's big bossy? - Here. - Hello, darling. Oh, I say, get a look at the suit. Expecting company or something? Al and Marge are coming to dinner. Come, Daddy, help me build the roof. You better shower and get some cocktails ready. You look down in the dumps. It's nothing much. - Is it a case? - I told you it's nothing. You have to use a different tone if you expect me to believe that. All right, I'll bring home an affidavit tomorrow if... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. It's all right. You're entitled to let off steam. It's just a letdown. I dunno, I guess it's a kind of an occupational disease with cops. You know that girl who phoned? That Lucy Chapman? Mm-hmm. Well... She's a case now. County Homicide. I'm sorry, darling. I'm... - (CHILD SOBBING) - It's all right, darling. Daddy'll help you build even a bigger one. (PHONE RINGING) Let's go see who's phoning us. - Can I talk? - Of course. Hello? Yes, it is. Who is this? He wants you. Who is it? I... I don't know. This is Dave Bannion. Listen, slob. Stop minding other people's business if you wanna stay alive. Some big people are getting annoyed. - Who is this? - (RECEIVER CLICKS) What did he say to you? You can fill in the four-letter words better than I can. Honey, I'll try to be back before Al and Marge leave. But, Dave, you don't even know who called. It's just another part of a scheme to make me crawl back in my shell. I don't know who called. But I know where to go to find out. Just a moment. Who do you wanna see? Mike Lagana. Oh sorry, I didn't recognise you, Sergeant. How many men on this detail, Officer? Three of us on the day and night shift and four after midnight. Ten cops to watch over Mike Lagana. One hundred bucks a day of the taxpayers' money. Well, Mr. Lagana kinda runs things. I guess that's no secret. No, that's no secret at all. - You like this detail? - I do what I'm told. That's what we're all supposed to do, isn't it? (DOORBELL RINGING) - Good evening, sir. - I'm from the police department. - Is Mr. Lagana in? - I'll see, sir. It's a little draughty outside. (BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING) Please, wait. This way, Officer. I promised my daughter her father wouldn't be seen or heard tonight. What's your name again? I think the butler missed it. Bannion. Dave Bannion. I'm from Homicide. I think I've heard of you. My mother. A great old lady. They broke the mold when they made her. She died last May. She lived here with me. Had her own suite of rooms, her own bath, everything. Never got over being surprised about my success. But you didn't come here to listen to me. Well, what is it this time? Benefit dance? Pension fund drive? I came about a murder. You came here to my home about a murder? A girl named Lucy Chapman was murdered last night. Or this morning. First she was tortured, then strangled. - Who runs your department? - It's Lieutenant Wilks. - Wilks, huh? - Mm-hm. It was an old-fashioned killing, Prohibition kind. That's why I thought... I don't care what you thought! I'm glad to help you boys whenever I can. But I got an office for that sorta thing. This is my home. And I don't like dirt tracked into it. I see. And I've violated your immaculate home, is that it? That's exactly it. And tomorrow morning, I'll see you don't get the chance to do it again. What'll you do? Make another phone call or have somebody make it for ya? I've seen some dummies in my time, but you're in a class by yourself. I'm stupid because I want some answers about a murder, is that it? Shut up and get out. We don't talk about those things in this house, do we? No, it's too elegant, too respectable. Nice kids. Party. Painting of Mama up there on the wall, huh? No place for a stinkin' cop! It's only a place for a hoodlum who built this house outta 20 years of corruption and murder. I'm gonna tell you something. You know, you couldn't plant enough flowers around here to kill the smell! - I warned you to get out. - Cops have homes, too. Only sometimes there isn't enough money to pay the rent because a cop gets hounded off the force by your thievin' cockroaches for trying to do an honest job. George! What's the matter, you think I live under a rock or somethin'? Your creeps have no compunction about phoning my house, giving me orders, talking to my wife like she was a... Yes, sir? Get rid of him. - Let's go, mister. - Take your hand off, George. It comes off when we get to your car. Better not, George. You wanna pinch hit for your boy, Lagana? (BIG BAND MUSIC FLOODING IN) What makes you think you can walk into Lagana's house and slug his bodyguard? You're no rookie. You been around long enough to know better. I'm not askin' you to take the rap for me. I'll stand up for what I do. Big fancy words. Well, I'm in no mood for 'em. I'm getting the squeeze from upstairs. What should I do when some cop-hater phones my home and insults my wife? Sit home and like it? Are you trying to tell me Lagana phoned your house? I'm trying to tell you that nothing dirty happens in this city without Lagana's okay. I'm not interested in your theories. Not when they affect my job! You're just begging to go back into uniform, pounding a beat out in the sticks! That Lucy Chapman killing is a County squeal. It's the Sheriff's headache, not ours. Now, I told you that once and I'm telling you again. I won't tell you a third time. That'll be all, Sergeant. Let the pans soak. I'll scour them when we come back. The main feature doesn't start for about an hour. Do you mind if I put my two cents in? No, honey, I don't mind. I've been thinking about Lieutenant Wilks. That leaning tower of jelly. You know how long he and his wife have looked forward to retirement? We've done it ourselves when we've looked that far ahead. Wilks only has a few more years to go. He's worried about his pension. If I had any sense, I'd have turned in my badge. Your big trouble is that you attack yourself from all sides like Jersey mosquitoes. You don't want to quit the department, not for one minute. What am I supposed to do? Hold on to my job by just stringing along, afraid to look to left or to the right because I might see something that they don't want me to see? If you do, you're going to have trouble from me. Just keep leading with your chin and don't you compromise. That's what I wanted to hear you say. Thanks, Inspector. - Honey? - Hmm? If I tell you something, you won't laugh? No, I won't laugh. I love you. See, I'm not laughing. Let's stay home, huh? We're having company. I can't sleep. Nonsense, Miss Bannion, you trot right back to bed. Hey, the thing for you to do now, according to the book, is to lead her to B-E-D with great kindness and great firmness. Let's go. Suppose you try it. I'll drive over to get the sitter. - Who d'you get? - Maxine. Tell her not to bring half the high school along to keep her company this time, huh? Hey! Little girls like you should be sleeping right about now. Tell me a story. In bed, darling, in bed. Which story, Daddy? Well, let's see... How about The Three Little Kittens? That lost their mittens! KATIE: Commissioner... I need the car keys. Here. Hey! Nothing. Nothing at all. Be back in a minute. All right. Go on, Daddy. In bed, first, darling. There we go. The three little kittens that lost their mittens. Go on, Daddy. All right. The three little kittens, er, they lost their mittens and they began to cry and oh, they had a terrible time, and their mother came home and she said, "Oh my! You kittens, you've lost your mittens..." (EXPLOSION) Stay in bed, darling! (BUZZER SOUNDING) Yes? - Bannion's here, Commissioner. - Have him come right in. I have a lot of work waiting for me in my office, Commissioner. Let it wait. Your being here will make Bannion more comfortable. I didn't get to speak to you at the funeral, Sergeant to tell you how hard your tragedy has hit us all. Sit down, will you? I've put an around-the-clock detail at your in-laws' house. The report says that's where your child is staying. - That's right. - Yes, it pays to play it safe. How is the little girl? She thinks her mother went on a trip. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe a loan from the fund to tide you over this period? Don't hesitate, Sergeant. Find out who planted the dynamite in my car. That's item one on the department's agenda. I've ordered Wilks to shove everything else aside. I want this case broken, if it takes 100 men to do it. We're checking back on every homicide you've handled. Why? I beg your pardon? I asked you why you're checking the files? You've made a lot of enemies, Bannion. Relatives and friends of killers you've sent to the chair. The motive was revenge. That's obvious. Is that the way it looks to you, too, Lieutenant? Well, it's worth exploring. COMMISSIONER: Of course, I'm only an appointed official. I haven't the training and experience you men have. But I'm certain we'll find the answer in one of these old homicides. Wilks has eight men on it, full-time. Don't worry, there'll be a payoff. When? It's natural to be impatient, but these things take time. Sometimes, they take forever. Now, that's no way to talk. Why, there isn't a man in the entire department wouldn't give a month's pay to break this case. What about you, Commissioner? How much would you give? Just what are you inferring, Sergeant? I'm asking how much would you give besides a lot of phony stories to the newspapers, a pat on the back and a few kind words for me? Why don't we go down to my office and talk. Oh, look Dave, you've gotta ease up. Take a few days off. I'll keep you informed. You... Why you frightened excuse for a cop... Now, just a minute, Bannion... Why don't you trot on down to your office and wait for him to call your orders? Oh, he'll phone you just as soon as he gets his orders from Mike Lagana. I don't want to exert the authority of my office. I prefer remembering that you've been through a lot. And I'm going to give you good reason to never forget it. You're under suspension! You better check with Lagana first. He might not approve. I'll have your badge and gun. Now. You can have it... permanently. One moment. I asked for your gun, too. That doesn't belong to the department. It's mine. Bought and paid for. I'm warning you, officially. Don't try to use it. I won't. Not until I catch up with the people who murdered my wife. Hold on a minute. Take this along, too, will you please? - Is the carriage for the truck? - No, it's... They'll bill you quarterly on the storage charges, Mr. Bannion. Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot. Dave! I was just leaving. Let the cab go. I'll give you a lift. I'd prefer the cab, thank you. Taxi! I just left Wilks. He said any off-the-record help you need is yours. He feels lousy about what happened. Put this carriage in the cab, will you please? Wilks gave me a list of mechanics with records. He got 'em from the bomb squad. - I have a list. - Wilks didn't know that. Tell him to stop bleeding for me. It'll run over his pension. You're way off base, Dave. You don't really know Wilks. I don't wanna know him. Look, I've had a bellyful of the department and Wilks. And you. Dave. I wish you'd see Father Masterson. Why? Because you're on a hate binge. You've decided people are all scared rabbits and you spit on 'em. Look, I gotta lock up. No man's an island, Dave. You can't set yourself against the world and get away with it. Get out. (CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYING) (HUMMING) Is that you, Vince? Yeah. Larry's with me. You weren't expecting somebody else, were ya? You'll do. It's better than drinking alone. - Hi, Larry. - Hi, Debby. Whaddya been doin' all day? Shopping. Some career, huh? Six days a week, she shops. On the seventh, she rests. All tired out. On her, it looks good. Thanks, friend. Go pour yourself a drink. Hey, that's nice perfume. Something new. It attracts mosquitoes and repels men. - Doesn't work that way with me. - It's not supposed to. (DOOR BUZZER SOUNDING) Ooh, that's His Highness. I forgot to tell you he was stopping off. She forgot?! Do you ever go to the circus, Larry? Uh-uh. You should. And take Vince. There's a man with a big hat that holds up the hoop, cracks the whip and the animals jump through. Hup, Vince! Hup, Larry! Hup, Vince! Hup, Larry! Hup, Vince! Hup, Larry! Hup, Vince! Hup... Putting on a vaudeville act, Debby? Just impersonations. How's your daughter, Mr. Lagana? She was going out formal tonight. DEBBIE: Oh. Can you imagine that? She wanted me to wait and put the final okay on her dress. I told her, what I thought didn't matter. "Just impress that football player." Oh, sometimes their father means more than football players. They come and go, but Dad's around for keeps, hmm? I hope Angela feels that way about me. Oh, I bet she does! Check the kitchen, will ya baby? Sure. Now, it's Debby. Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! Hup, Debby! She's a young girl, Vince. Don't let her drink so much. If she keeps it up, she's goes outta here on her ear. She's got no claim-check on me. Well, when that happens, give me a ring. I'm a rebound man from way back. I don't like gutter talk. Sorry. "Sorry"? I'm tired of hearing you sound off and then apologise. Vince gave you two simple contracts and you loused up both of 'em. - Oh, no, wait... - Shut up and listen! Throwing the Chapman girl out on a county road brought us all the advertising we didn't want. Killing Mrs. Bannion... How stupid can you get? How did I know she'd be using the car? Prisons are bulging with dummies who wonder how they got there. I can't afford people who make mistakes. - I make myself clear? - Sure. Vince and I have things to talk about. I got an appointment in half an hour with Mrs. Duncan. She's raised her salary to $500 a week. Are we gonna pay it? You sound like Larry. As long as that letter her husband left stays in her safe deposit box we'll pay what she asks. - Now, what about Bannion? - Running around in circles. - You sure? - Positive. But, if you want insurance, we can take care of him now. Vince, you worry me. We've stirred up enough headlines. The election's too close. Things are changing in this country, Vince. A man who can't see that hasn't got eyes. Never get the people steamed up, they start doing things. Grand juries, election investigations. Deportation proceedings. I don't wanna land in the same ditch with the Lucky Lucianos. (TRAIN BELL RINGING) (TRAIN RUMBLING BY) Slim Farrow around? Not anymore. Where can I reach him? Spring Rock Cemetery, six feet under. Died three days ago. Bad ticker. He owe you some money? No. I was hoping to get some information. Then it makes no difference. Slim wouldn't give information to his own minister, if he had a minister. Well, maybe you can help me. My wife was murdered ten days ago. Someone planted dynamite in our car. - You Bannion the cop? - That's right. Was Slim mixed up in that? That's what I'm trying to find out. Sorry, I can't help you. Did he have any visitors? Did he get any phone calls? All I know about Slim is that he's dead. Did he have a set spot to work? You know, a place where he kept his tools? All the tools are mine. There's nothing here for you, mister. Nothing at all. Do you mind if I walk around the yard? Talk to your men? I have to mind. When it comes to my bread and butter, I stay careful. It doesn't matter to you that Slim might have been mixed up in a murder, huh? Sure it matters. But what can I do about it? I don't know anything. You're a liar. You can't insult me, mister. I said I don't know anything and that's how it stands. You know I've been meeting your kind every day now for ten years. Scared rabbits that never see a thing. You wouldn't stick out your big, fat neck for anybody, would ya? That's the truth. But it's my big, fat neck. So, now, if you're through talkin', I'll get back to work. I oughta... That won't change my story. Cops are paid to take risks. I'm not. You see, I've got a wife and kids, too. WOMAN: Mr. Bannion? Mr. Bannion! Mr. Atkins might come outside. He isn't a mean man. Not many people would hire someone like me. It's just that he's frightened. I am, too. But there was a man came to see Slim about two weeks ago. They had a long talk out in the yard. Do you remember what he looked like? Well, I'm not much good at those things. He was... Well, he was about your height, and he... Well, he wore rather fancy clothes. You know, colourful. Would you be able to recognise him again? Oh, yes. He came into the office and asked me where Slim was. - How about phone calls? - A few. A man named Larry left a message once, just about the same time. No last name? No. He just said to tell Slim to call him at a place... A most peculiar name. Something like a monastery. You know, where people go off alone, to think. The Retreat? That's it. He said to call him at The Retreat. I'm very grateful, Miss... Parker. Selma Parker. Miss Parker. You've been most helpful. Oh, I'm glad. - Good luck, Mr. Bannion. - Thank you. Shall we say good night to Daddy and put baby to bed now? Yes. Goodnight, darling. - Good night, Daddy. - Sleep tight, honey. - Thanks, Marge. - You bet. - Goodnight, Joyce. - Goodnight. Say, Al, do me a favour, will you? Call this number at exactly 9:30 on the dot and ask for Larry. Larry who? That's what I'm trying to find out. Larry's all I know. Is it a lead? I'm hoping so. I got my fingers crossed. Thanks, Al. (ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYING) A beer. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Thirty-five. Retreat. Larry who? You must be kidding, mister! What am I supposed to do, page Larry anybody? VINCE: Look, keep your hands off! I won't tell you again! I'm sorry, Mr. Stone. When I say, "Don't pick up the dice so fast," I mean it! - I'll roll them again, if you like. - Go ahead. - (SCREAMING) - Stop it! (SOBBING) Honey, that guy's way outta line. - Reds, don't fight! - I gotta. Please Red! Sit down, junior! Get your boyfriend outta here sister. - Come on, let's go home. - Look, you're not scaring me! Please, Reds, come on! Where you going, thief? This isn't your business, Bannion. All right, thief, suppose you tell me what my business is. Go on, tell me. You like working girls over, don't you? Don't make a mistake, Bannion. Don't play hero with me. Maybe you're the one that worked over Lucy Chapman. Well, take it easy, Sergeant. I don't know what you're talking about. (SOBBING) Here, baby. This is for you. Get yourself somethin' nice. No hard feelings, huh? That square it, Sergeant? Get outta here while you can still walk. Sure. Sure. You, too. - Are you gonna be all right? - Yeah. Yes, sure. Thanks, mister. - Sergeant. - Yeah? I'd like to buy you a drink. With Vince Stone's money? I'd choke on it. (CAR HORN HONKING) You get your kicks out of insulting people? Aren't you Vince Stone's girl? The way you ask it, it sounds like a bunch of dirty words. Well, that was the general idea. Everybody's walking out on me tonight. - What are they after? - Dunno. You, I think. Vince Stone chase you after me? You saw him leave me in the bar like an old beer or something. Come on. Let's find out. I mean, if it's you I'm after. (CAR DOOR SLAMMING) - I'm staying at the Marland Hotel. - Okay. You make up your mind in a hurry, don't ya? Uh-huh. Marland Hotel. Say, I like this. Early nothing. There's just scotch. Is that all right? Fine. - Water? - Good. How come you sat still when Stone burned that girl? Well, I'll tell you. The last time I butted in, Vince worked me over. Is that how it is being his girl? Most of the time, it's a lotta fun. Expensive fun. Whadda you got against him? I don't like thieves. Well, you'll never get anywhere in this town not liking Vince. - I'm not trying to get anywhere. - That's obvious. Well! That's some improvement. You know, it's funny sometimes I feel about Vince the way you looked at him tonight. He can be a pretty good guy. And other times he can be... But why kick? You gotta take the bad with the good. Is the "good" good enough? Clothes, travel, expensive excitement. What's wrong with that? Nothing, if you don't care where his money comes from. The main thing is to have the money. I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better! Did you think I was an heiress or something before I met Vince? I didn't think about you at all. Thank you. I didn't know you, how could I? Oh, that's better. Got a refill? - You know Larry at The Retreat? - Larry who? Erm... it's Larry... I forget his last name. He's about my size, wears flashy clothes. I know lotsa Larrys. This one was a friend of Vince Stone's. I don't know all his friends, fortunately. You know Mike Lagana, don't you? Just to say hello and goodbye to. When Vince talks business, I go out and get my legs waxed or something. I don't like to hear things. Why don't you stop the cross-examination? I didn't come up here to talk outta school. Why did you come up? Well, why don't we call it "research" or something? Or to needle Stone? Oh, well, you're about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs. Didn't you ever tell a girl pretty things? You know, she's got hair like the west wind, eyes like limpid pools, skin like velvet? I'll put you in a cab. Did I say something wrong? No. I must've broken one of the house rules. You really want me to go? I wouldn't touch anything of Vince Stone's with a ten-foot pole. That's a rotten thing to say. Everybody winning? - Hello, Debby. - Hi Deb! - How are you doing, Vince? - Okay. Where you been? The Gaiety Club. Late show. Deal me out a while, huh, boys. How was the show? The usual routines, not too bad. Why didn't you come straight home? The way you ran out, I didn't think you cared. What do you mean, "ran out"? It wasn't a stroll. With the elections this close, I can't afford trouble with a crazy ex-cop. He's not so crazy. I've got a hot flash for you. He hates your guts. How would you know? I was there, remember? I'm the girl you left at the bar. I phoned The Retreat. Tierney said you offered to buy Bannion a drink. Tierney wouldn't know a gag unless it hit him right in the face. He said you followed Bannion outside. I went out looking for you. You made better time getting away than they make in the Olympics. - That's a real pretty kisser. - Isn't it? I thought you and Bannion played footsie while my back was turned. You ought to trade Tierney in. Get yourself a more reliable stool pigeon. Maybe I got myself a better stoolie. - How was the Gaiety Club? - No! My arm, Vince! My arm! You like cops, do you? Don't, Vince, please! - Where'd you go with him? - My arm! My arm! VINCE: I asked you a question. Where? DEBBY: I only saw him on the street. Only the street! - I suggest we call it a night. - I suggest you shut your mouth! - Where'd you go with Bannion? - Nowhere. Nowhere! He dropped me off at the Gaiety! Sure, The Gaiety! The Gaiety! Oh, you pig! You lyin' pig! (BUBBLING SOUND) - (LIQUID SPLASHING) - (SCREAMING) My face! My face! (HYSTERICAL SOBBING) I'll fix you and your pretty face! - Vince, she's scalded! - She had it comin'! (SOBBING) Don't just stand there. Get her to a doctor! You'll have to make a police report. That's why we're sending you. - Go on, get moving! - I'll try. I'll try. (HYSTERICAL SOBBING) (SOBBING) Shut the door! Mike? Yes, Vince? How do you know she didn't tell Bannion anything? Debby isn't your problem anymore. She's ours. I want insurance. But I don't want her found off any county highway. I don't want her found at all. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Who is it? - Debby Marsh. - Who's with you? - I'm alone. I've been hurt. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Put it out! Please! Vince threw hot coffee in my face. I'm gonna be scarred. The whole side of my face will be scarred. (SOBBING) Where's Stone now? I don't know. They made Higgins take me to the doctor. Higgins, the police commissioner? Yes. After the doctor put on the bandages, I ran out. Can I stay with you? Please can I stay? I'll get you a room on this floor. Who else was with Stone? Gillen, from the city council. George Fuller, Vince's lawyer, and Larry Gordon. I told the doctor I didn't care what he had to do, or about the pain only I didn't want my face scarred! Who's Larry Gordon? You don't care. You don't care what happened to me. You don't care about anything or anybody. I was followed when I came here with you. That's why I got this! Gil, this is Dave Bannion. I'm going to need another room on this floor. Yeah, it's for a friend of mine. I don't want it registered. Yeah, that's right. I don't want anybody to know she's here. Right. You'll be safe here. Want a shot of scotch? Please. Gordon is the Larry you asked about. Vince imported him from Chicago a few months ago. Thanks. Tomorrow I'll have another doctor look you over. I guess a scar isn't so bad. Not if it's only on one side. I can always go through life sideways. Gordon lives at the Wilton Apartments. (BUZZER SOUNDING) (BUZZER SOUNDING) Is Mrs. Davenport at home? You got the wrong apartment. (BUZZER SOUNDING) I told you it was... Get up! You must be nuts. Come on, get up. What about Slim Farrow? You're punchy! Go on, pick it up. I won't kill you, not right away. You got a wrong steer. If I knew what you was talking about... What did Slim do for you? I swear on my mother's... (GASPING) What did he do for you? When I let go, start talkin'. If you don't, I'll finish the job. Talk. He told me to get you. Vince Stone. I hired Slim. What about Lucy Chapman? Stone. He was scared Duncan told her things. Was Duncan on the take? Well, yeah, for years. Why didn't they shut up Mrs. Duncan? I don't know! Did she go on the payroll? - I think so. I'm not sure. - What's she got on 'em? I don't know. I just take orders. You're gonna give me a break, aren't you Bannion? I told you what I know! I'm through with you. But your friends aren't. I'm gonna spread the word that you talked. You're out of business, thief. VINCE: We caught up with Larry before he got to the airport. He was in such a hurry, it took a couple of slugs to stop him. What's left of him is on the way to the river. Debby? What about her? She doesn't worry me. But Bannion does. Larry must have talked his head off or he wouldn't have started runnin'. When you use second-raters like Gordon, it's trouble. I've told you that before. If you had okayed getting rid of Bannion he wouldn't be a problem now. And when Duncan wanted out, I asked you to let me handle him. But, oh no! You thought talking to him might keep him in line. So what happens? He knocks himself off! Don't make me the fall guy, Mike. I'm no Larry Gordon. The reformers would be delighted to hear us accusing each other. All right, we both made mistakes. The point is, correct them. Bannion on the bottom of the river with Larry and there's no more problem. Maybe a bigger one. If he knows anything, he's put it on paper. Anything happens to him, it becomes public property. The Duncan setup all over again. That's a gamble we've gotta take. We don't. Take something Bannion values more than himself and we keep him quiet. As soon as you're set, have Higgins call off the police guard at the Eldridge Street house. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yes? Yes, Mrs. Duncan? He's at my door. What'll I do? (BUZZER SOUNDING) He knows I'm at home. My car's in the garage. I'll take care of it. You just stall him. Yes, I understand. (BUZZER SOUNDING) Oh, Mr. Bannion! I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. The furniture's the same. Nothing's been changed. You haven't started living high yet, have you? What are you talking about? Your husband was on Lagana's payroll. Now you are. He must've put down all the facts and figures in writing for Lagana to hold still for blackmail. What did you do with it? I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. But if you want to look around, please go right ahead. Oh, it wouldn't be here. You're much smarter than Lucy Chapman. Thank you. You told Lagana about Lucy. You have a horrid mind. Poor Lucy. You were delighted. You were even happy when your husband blew his brains out. We were getting along very well until the soul-struggling began. Want to know something ridiculous? It was after his affair with Lucy Chapman that he wanted to turn over a new leaf. Our city is being strangled by a gang of thieves and you protect Lagana and Stone for the sake of a soft, plush life. The coming years are going to be just fine, Mr. Bannion. There aren't going to be any "coming years" for you. None at all. I don't threaten easily. If anything happens to you, the evidence comes out. That's the way you arranged it. Didn't you, bright lady? You got it all put away someplace. That's how you kept Lagana over a barrel. But I'm not Lagana. With you dead, the big heat follows. The big heat for Lagana, for Stone and for all the rest of the lice. (CAR SCREECHING OUTSIDE) Mr. Lagana is an excellent life insurance agent. What's the trouble? Why nothing, Officer. This is Police Sergeant Bannion. Sorry, Sergeant. We got a call there was trouble. Sergeant Bannion... Oh, I'm sorry. It's ex-Sergeant, isn't it? He'll be leaving with you, Officer. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's me, Bannion. How about a little light in here, huh? I've got to get used to being seen sometime, I guess. I've been feeling like something that's been shut up because nobody wants to look at it. Aren't you supposed to take one of these before meals? Here you are. Some water? Just sitting here thinking's pretty rough when you've spent most of your life not thinking. Now eat your soup, huh? What was your wife like, Dave? Twenty-seven years old, light hair, grey eyes. That's a police description. Did she like to cook? Like to be surprised? What kind of things made her laugh? That's what... I'm sorry. You don't wanna talk about her. Certainly not with me. Not with anyone. Did you find Larry? What? Yeah. Yeah, I found him. And? I ran into a brick wall. Bertha Duncan. The cop's widow? He left her a million-dollar trust fund. Wrote down everything there was to know about the syndicate. Vince must hate her insides. He never could take losing or being pressured. He's got to take it. If she dies, the letter goes to the newspapers. You know, I almost killed her an hour ago. I should've. I don't believe you could. If you had, there wouldn't be much difference between you and Vince Stone. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Must be for me. I told 'em downstairs I was up here. Yes? Yes, Marge? The relief detail didn't show up. I called the police station. They said they weren't coming anymore. Keep the door locked until Al gets home. I'll be there in an hour. Keep that for company. Okay, Mac. Get 'em up high. Upstairs, Mac. Nice and easy now. Hold it, Mark! Hold it! Nice goin'. This is my brother-in-law. What is this? Al said to stop everybody. You're doing fine, Mark. Get back downstairs. Sorry, Mac. Yes. It's okay. - Is Joyce all right? - Sure. Marge has her inside. I got the boys over just in case. This is my brother-in-law, Bill Rutherford, Harry Shoenstein, Hank O'Connell. - Hi, Sergeant. - How are ya? I guess civilian life hasn't slowed Mark down so much, huh? Are you kidding? It hasn't slowed him down at all. When trouble comes, it'll be from hoodlums who know their business. I'm afraid they won't be stopped by amateurs whose hearts happen to be in the right place. Do we look like the cast from some Maypole dance? I've been places those creeps wouldn't go unless they rode in a 50-ton tank. I went in on foot... The story of how he won the Medal of Honour, or something. All right, big wit! But I'm tellin' you, anybody comes through that door and touches that kid is gonna wind up dead! Harry 'Schoenhopper', the angry poet! Seriously, Bannion, we can handle things. I was never so sure of anything in my life. Do you know where the trouble's coming from? I'd feel easier if all of you stayed here. - Daddy! - There's my girl. Hello, sweetheart! How are you? Will you tell me a story, Daddy? Why, sure. Which story, darling? - The Three Little Kittens. - That lost their mittens... We just heard the precinct detail was called off. You're sticking your neck way out. WILKS: It's a fine night for it. Hello, Dave. Aren't you throwing that pension of yours down into the sewer? I got my wife's okay. In fact, Gertie used language I didn't think she knew. It's the first time in years I've breathed good, clean air. Well, you don't have to stay, Hal has some of his Army friends upstairs. WILKS: If we stick around, it'll make it official. - Thanks. - Dave. Where are you going now? - Nowhere special. - Want company? Uh-uh. A report came in this afternoon about your barging in on Mrs. Duncan. You're not going there again? No. (INSISTENT BUZZING) I'm Vince Stone's girl, Debby Marsh. May I see you for a moment? I was just leaving, but please come in. Thank you. Were you in an accident? - Yes. - I'm sorry. - You have a nice home. - Thank you. - Did Mr. Stone send you? - No. I've been thinking about you and me, how much alike we are. The mink-coated girls. I don't understand you. What are you here for, Miss Marsh? Debby. We should use first names, Bertha. We're sisters under the mink. You're not making any sense, Miss Marsh. I'd better call Mr. Stone and have him pick you up. You're not well. I've never felt better in my life. (GUNSHOTS) (DOOR UNLOCKING) It'll burn for a long time, Vince. (GLASS SHATTERING) It doesn't look bad now, but in the morning your face will be like mine. Look at it. It isn't pretty, is it? You'll walk through side streets and alleys so that people won't stare at you. Oh, but you're lucky. It won't be for long. Bertha Duncan is dead! No more insurance for you and Lagana. The lid's off the garbage can. And I did it! (GUNSHOT) (DOOR BEING FORCED) (GUNSHOT) - Dave! - (GUNSHOT) Debby. I killed Mrs. Duncan. This is an emergency. Get an ambulance to 257 Flower Street. The penthouse. Dave! (EMPTY GUN CLICKING) Go on, shoot! (GUN BARREL CLICKS SLOWLY) Shoot! Shoot! Get up. Get up! (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) We'll take your gun, Dave. You can have him, too. There's one charge against him, to start with. (HANDCUFFS CLICKING) Over there. We went to the Duncan house. I'm sorry you got there first. I didn't. Did you call it in? We wanted to catch up with you first. Put a cover on Lagana, Higgins and every other thief in town. Duncan left a confession. It'll come out now. The lice will try to run. There's no use moving her. You can close your file on the Bertha Duncan killing. Dave. Yes. Am I going to die? If I said you'd live another 100 years, you'd call me a liar. I don't wanna die. I must look awful. Vince shouldn't have ruined my looks. It was a rotten thing to do. - Dave. - Yes? I'm going to die. No, Debby. Remember how angry you got when I asked you about your wife? I wasn't angry. Oh, you and Katie would've gotten along fine. What was she like? A real Irish blow-top. But she always got over it fast. She used to raise the roof with me for missing dinner or leaving the bathroom in a mess. A few minutes later, she'd come in with a drink in her hand for me just as though nothing had happened. You know, Kate, she was a 'sampler'. She used to take sips of my drink and puffs on my cigarette. Sometimes she used to taste the food off my plate. We got a big kick out of that. I like her. I like her a lot. Sometimes when I came home from work she'd have the baby dressed up like a... Oh, like a little princess. One of the most important parts of the day was when I came in and saw her looking like something just stepped down off a birthday cake. I guess it... I guess it's that way with most families. - How about some coffee, Hugo? - Coming right up, Sarge! (PHONE RINGING) Homicide, Bannion. Got it. They have a hit-and-run over on South Street. - Keep the coffee hot, Hugo. - Okay, sir. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
