[dramatic orchestral music] [gentle music] [sweet gentle music] Jeff, it's beautiful. There's just one thing, young lady. What's that? I don't believe in long engagements. [woman] Neither do I. Now, I may be wrong, but I never did believe in long engagements, and I always will. Oh, Mother. Darling. Isn't it wonderful? Oh, it's lovely. It looks just like the one your father almost gave me. [man] I beg your pardon Mrs. Tibbitt, but don't you think I better speak to your husband about this? Why, yes, Jeffrey, I think that would be a good idea. Zero! Zero! Ma'am, Ms. Tibbitt? [Bessie] Zero, come here! Yes, Missus, this knife keeps slippin' and spoilin' the size of them potatoes. Zero, run down to the village and tell Dr. Tibbitt to come home right away. - Yeah. - Wait a minute. "Tell him Mrs. Carter's comin" to dinner. You will invite your mother, won't you? Yes, of course. Wait a minute! Now, let me see. What was the other thing I wanted to tell you to tell him? Uh, I don't know, do I, Ms. Tibbitt. About the engagement. [laughing] Oh, yes, of course. Tell him Mr. Jeffrey wants to ask his permission to marry Miss Mary. You got that all straight? Yes'm, but not exactly. Well, that's just fine, now run along. Yes'm. And please hurry, because I've got a million things to do. Well, to work, to work, to work, to work. [humming] Don't folks know you can get places, more safer without so much hurryin'? Get outta my way, boy, don't you see I'm on business. [people chattering] It's a boy. [crowd cheering] And you just take it easy and relax, Mr. Dover, and in a few days you'll be yourself again. A boy, Doctor. I still can't believe it. [chuckles] Well, if at first you... Oh, by the way, Doctor, ah, about your bill. I'll pay it at just as soon as... Never mind, Mr. Dover. This one's on me. [men laughing] Well, good day. Good day. [people chattering] [crowd cheering] [Zero] Dr. Tibbitt, Dr. Tibbitt, sir? What's the matter, Zero? Ms. Tibbitt's saying hurry to the house, 'cause it's powerful important. - Get in the buggy. - Yes, sir. I forgot the other part of the message and that was the most important. What was wrong? "It was somethin" 'bout plots or something. Tell what I was supposed to... What happened Zero? Uh, trying to figure out now, but I can't. Well, is somebody sick? No, sir, she never said medicine, she ju... Well, was there a fire? No, there was no firemen there neither. Well, can't you think of what's wrong? Yes, sir, I know what's wrong, but I just can't remember, Doctor. And I remembered so much when I first started to go there running. And just, ain't that a shame. Well, never mind, we're home now and I can find out for myself. Yes, sir. [Muttering] [Bessie humming] Bessie! Oh, Bessie! Bessie, are you all right? Fine, thank you, Emory! How are you? [Emory] But, what about Mary, is she all right? [Bessie] Fine, she's just fine, Emory. [humming] But, Bessie! Yes, dear? Zero told me Mary, how does the upstairs look? It's all finished, Mother. Just sit down and stop worrying, dear. Oh, Daddy, isn't it all exciting? Isn't what exciting? Where do these flowers go, Mary? Right in that vase, Mother, that's where I just put them. Oh, well, you know how to do it, then. [Bessie humming] [Emory] Mary, what's all this excitement about? Zero, where's that silver polish? Polish is uh Mary, wait a minute. DehHa! DehHa! - Yes'm? - [Mary] Where's the silver polish? Never mind, I've got it. Oh, Daddy, I'm so happy. Aren't you? Dehlia. Come out of that oven and tell me what's going on in this house! I's sorry, Dr. Tibbitt, I got so much work to do, and Ms. Tibbitt told me directly that I wasn't to talk to nobody, not even to myself. But what I'm trying to find out is Zeke, don't let me catch you messin' with this here pie, ya hear me? - Yes. - Dehlia, what I want to know is I's sorry, Doctor, but Ms. Tibbitt done give me strict orders. Can't find out anything around here. Nobody wants to tell you what's going on. Ain't nothin' much going on here, exceptin' the weddin... - Wedding? - Yes, sir. Who's gettin' married? Miss Mary. My daughter? Yes, sir! Oh, Mary! Oh, Mary! Mary! Mary! Oh, Mary, I want to talk to you. I beg your pardon, Dr. Tibbitt, there's something I wanted to ask you. Can't stop now, Jeff! But Doctor, I I'm sorry, Jeff, not right now, I-I... this is very important. But this is pretty important, too, sir. Ah, you'll have to see me later, Jeff, I want to talk to Mary. But that's just it, I want to marry her. That's fine, son. What? You wanna marry her? Yes, sir! If it's all right with you, sir. Why, sure. Sure, it's all right with me. If it's all right with you, pumpkin. It's all right with me, Doc. [sighs] Bessie! Now, Emory! Don't stand there and shout at me! I'm busy! I haven't time! But, but they're gonna get married! Of course they are, that's what I've been tellin' you. But, but, Bessie, this is the finest piece of news I've ever heard. It's wonderful! And we'll drink a toast to it right now! Ah, Bessie, where is that bottle of real, old sherry? Oh, I threw that old sherry away. I have some nice new sherry. I'll show you right where it is in the kitchen. Unless I put it somewhere else. Oh, Mary, put these flowers in water. We want everything to look just right before Mrs. Carter gets here. [humming] Sherry, kitchen. Huh? [Laughing] [Bessie humming] - Jeff? - Hm? Did you tell her yet? Mother? I haven't had a chance yet, honey. I figured I'd tell her tonight. Well, I'm kinda worried. You see, you're folks have always been so important. And your grandfather and father both being governor. And a town named after your family, and all that. How's your mother gonna feel about my family? I know what you mean, honey. But Mom's really not so bad. She's got a lot of social ideas, first family stuff, and all that. She's gonna be all right! I'm the happiest father in the state of Mississippi. So am I. [gentle music] Um, Mr. Doctor, I just remembered the rest of that message... Never mind, Zero. Yes, sir, I sure I hope I don't forget again. Jeff, I was just thinking, how'd it be we don't say anything to mother tonight about us getting married? Why not? I'm sure she'd be interested, too. Well, you see, Mother, Mrs. Carter's always had an idea of Jeff marrying well, someone sort of social. Not just some little ol' country doctor's family. Well, it isn't as bad as that, I Jeff, so, I thought if we broke it to her kinda easy. You know, like Doc does, give it to her in small doses. Well, that's a good idea, Jeff! Back to work, to work, to work, to work. [Bessie humming] Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' along, too. I'll see you to the door, Jeff. Good day, sir. [Emory] Good day. [Jeff] Now, you're not going to worry about tonight, darling, 'cause everything's gonna work out just fine, ya hear? [Mary] I hope so. Hurry back. [Jeff] I will. [gentle music] Doc, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean what I said about your being a country doctor. Well, what did you mean? Well, I know you're the finest doctor this town has ever had. And you used to be successful. You took care of all the best families. Why, Mrs. Carter used to pay you hundreds of dollars a year, didn't she? Yes. And then one day you insulted her. Told her she wasn't sick and didn't need a doctor and you wouldn't go back to see her again. Unless she broke her leg. Didn't you? Yes, but... And it wasn't only Mrs. Carter. Did the same to everyone else in town who could really afford a doctor. And now look at us, we owe money to everyone. We don't even own this house, the bank owns it. And Mrs. Carter owns the bank. Why, we haven't even paid our servants in over a year. Actually, I'm so ashamed, I can't hold my head up. I'm sorry, pumpkins, but I know, Doc, but what's the matter? What's happened? What is it? That! Oh, what's that got to do with it? Well, I was sitting here reading it one day, and I suddenly discovered that it had a lot of sense to it. Especially the part where it says, "All men are created equal, and are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” I still don't understand. Aw, pumpkins, I wasn't happy feeding pink pills to Mrs. Carter and her rich friends. I'd rather do something for somebody that needs a doctor. Even if they can't pay their bills. And besides, I can't see where any man can make a mistake in living up to The Declaration of Independence. Can you? No. Doc, I guess you're still my favorite father. Miss Mary, Ms. Tibbitt wants you in the kitchen right away! Run along, pumpkins, your mother needs you. I will if you promise me one thing. What? That you won't read it again until after the wedding. [both laughing] [Emory sighs] [overlapping chatter] I done looked all down here and everywhere. That's mighty funny, it was right here 10 years ago. Things certainly do get mislaid around this house. Maybe they ain't mislaid. Yes'm, I done looked all over for them. Zero, why don't you look down your side. - Look down on that side. - I looked down here. - Yes'm, I did. - [overlapping chatter] Mother, what are you looking for? You remember that cut glass punchbowl, Mary. The one that we borrowed from Mrs. Randolph, that she loaned to Mrs. Smith, after she borrowed it back from Mrs. Watson. I wonder where it is. Why, that's our punchbowl. You loaned it to Mrs. Randolph again. How time flies! Zeke, you run down, ask her to lend it to us, tell her she can borrow it right back again in the morning. - Yes'm. - And hurry back, ya hear! - [Zeke] Yes. - Now, what was I lookin' for? Bowl, Ms. Tibbitt. Bowl, oh, oh, yes, I still think it's down here somewhere. - Look in there, Dehlia. - Yes'm, I did. Up... up there, Dehlia, did you I oughta know what's in my own kitchen! - [upbeat music] - [people chattering] [man] Ladies and gentlemen, Professor J. Thorndike McCrackle's famous Eastern Indian nerve tonic. A remedy that I've brought you at the risk of life and limb, through the teaming jungles of Borneo and across the burning sands of the Sahara. A remedy, [throat clearing], a remedy that I've, I found, pardon me just a moment, just a moment, be right with you. Ladies and gentlemen, Professor J. Thorndike McCrackle's famous Eastern Indian nerve tonic, that will make you as strong as an elephant. [audience applauding] Wait, wait, no rushing. I absolutely refuse to sell one bottle of this remedy until I offer you first a little entertainment, by that Queen of the Private Herd, that Sacred Elephant, Zenobia! [people chattering] Whatsa matter, Babe? Whatsa matter? Are you sick? Are you sick? [Zenobia trumpets] Can't you tell me? Aw! Something's gotta be done! Here, here! Here ya are, honey! Here, take this! C'mon! Take this! C'mon! Take this, this'll do ya good. C'mon, drink it right down, Zenobia. Thatagirl! Are you in pain, huh? She's never acted like this before. Is... is there a doctor in this town, a good doctor? Dr. Tibbitt, he's a good doctor. Well, you go get him right quick and I'll give you a bottle of my tonic for nothing. - Yes, sir. - Hurry now! [Zenobia trumpets] [music continues] Dr. Tibbitt! Dr. Tibbitt! What's the matter, Zeke? She's sick, she's dyin'. Who's dyin'? Where? Over to the carnival. Come quick! She's dyin' fast! Well, I better go and help her! Emory, you can't leave now! Oh! Mrs. Carter'll be here any minute. But, Bessie, it's my duty if someone's ill. Oh, she ain't ill, she's sick. Goodbye, dear. C'mon, Zeke. Hurry back, darling. Oh, it won't take me long. Well, to work, to work, to work, to work, to work. [humming] Professor! Professor! [Professor] Yes! Yes! Professor, this is Dr. Tibbitt. Oh, Doctor, thank goodness you're here. Now, what seems to be the matter with her? Why, I don't know. It's never happened before in all these years we've been together. Ah, how old is your wife? It's not my wife. I beg your pardon, then. How old is the patient? Oh, uh, let's see, I'd say about 104 years. Hm, unusual. Is she an active person? Uh, how much does she weigh? Well, I haven't weighed her lately but I'd judge about 6,172 pounds. Do you feel all right? Why, certainly I feel all right! It isn't me, it's Zenobia. - Where is the... - She's in here! C'mon, hurry up! Six thousand pounds, There she is. Look here, I'm not an elephant doctor. Oh, well, then, in that case, I don't think I trust you with Zenobia. There's nothing too good for her. My dear man, I didn't ask to get that Dr. Tibbitt, please do something, she's sick. - Yeah. - Well, as long as I'm here. I'll see what I can do for her. Well, that... that's fine. It's all right, baby, this is the doctor, he'll fix you up. - Say, ah. - Ah. - Not you. - Oh. Excuse me. I should've brought the thermometer from the back porch. Yeah, she quite a large girl. Hm. Take it easy, babe, take it easy! Let's see. - Uh. - Of course. - [Zenobia huffs] - She hasn't got a temperature? No. Oh, thank goodness. Take it easy now. Down, down, down, don't exert yourself. - That's it. - [Zenobia huffs] What do you hear, Doctor? What do you hear? A salute of 21 guns somewhere! Oh, for goodness sakes, what'll we do? Well, you must keep her good and warm. Oh, I wonder how I'll do that. Well, that's your problem. Oh. Oh, yeah, sure. Well, say, Doctor. - Hmm. - Now, how much do I owe you for this? Eh, forget it. Well, well, thanks. Say, you know what I'll do for you? I'll tell everybody in this town what a fine elephant doctor you turned out to be. - Thank you. - It's all ri... Oh, no, no, no! We must keep the elephant our little secret. Oh. Understand? - Good day, then. - Good day. Oh, Mary, have you seen your father? Why mother, you sent Zero for him. Did 1? Well, let's find Zero and then we'll know where your father is. Ms. Tibbitt, I was lookin' all over for the doc and I ain't seen him. Doc is sure the one person that oughtn't be hard to see. Oh, Zero, this is so upsettin'. Mrs. Carter'll be arrivin' any minute. Now, Mother, he'll be here. He said he would. It'll be all right. Just so long as he doesn't blurt out everything in front of Mrs. Carter, you know how he is. Miss Mary. Yes, Dehlia. Oh, maybe we shouldn't have invited your father tonight. - [bell ringing] - [gasps] Here they are! Now, now, don't... don't be excited! Quick, everybody be calm! I-I-I'll answer the door myself. [bell ringing] Straighten up, Zero. Yes, Ma'am. [door thudding] Virginia, my smellin' salts. You should answer the door, Zero. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh dear. Not... not 'til I say, "Ready." Mary! Ready? Yes'm. Not yet! - No. - [door thudding] I think I'd better... Oh, Mother, please wait a minute. It's just some mistake. Now, don't get yourself all worked up, Mrs. Carter. Thank you, Virginia. What's the matter, Mother, is anything wrong? Everything's fine, just fine. You... you sit here, darlin', that's right. Ready! Yes'm. Good evening, Mrs. Carter, Mr. Jeff. Good evening, Zero. My smellin' salts, Virginia. Ah, you have them Mrs. Carter, in your hand. Oh, yes, yes! Thank you. Ms. Tibbitt is waitin' in the livin' room, Mrs. Carter. Come along, dear. - Good evening. - [Mary] Oh, good evening. Mother, this is Mrs. Carter. Is it? Oh, yes, I... I'm so glad you could come. - You know Virginia Reynolds. - Of course I do. I hope I'm not intruding. Not at all, dear, I'm happy to have you. Won't y'all sit down. Oh, thank you, so nice of you. I knew you wouldn't mind my bringing Virginia along tonight, she's company for me. Why, Mrs. Carter, I'm delighted. There's nothing like company when you want somebody with you, for company. By the way, where is Dr. Tibbitt? Mary, why don't you sing something? Why, Mother, you know I can't sing very well. Perhaps Mrs. Carter would enjoy a nice glass of sherry. Yes, yes, I think that might help. I feel one of my migraines coming on. I'll get it for you right away, Mrs. Carter. Let me help you. Oh, Jeff, it's all goin' wrong, the whole thing. Mother's always that way at first, honey, but she'll thaw out. Well, anyway, I'm glad we didn't plan to break the news to her tonight. So am I. Dehlia, is this what you want? No, that ain't it. Mm, if that chicken don't look good enough to eat, I'll eat it! No, you won't! Not even the gizzard? No. Go over and get me that tureen. Tureen. Tureen? Dehlia, tureen is for the soup, ain't it? Just get it! Mm, but this is more appropriate. Right, tureen. And when I consulted with a specialist in Vienna about my nose, they told me I had the most unusual case of a tropic rhinitis. - Oh. - Uh, sort of a smell blind, you know? Smell blind? Yes, for example, right now I can almost imagine I smell [sniffs] fried chicken. Don't you like fried chicken? Like fried chicken? Why, it's the worst thing in the world for a person even with an ordinary stomach. Course! That's just the way I feel about it myself. Will you excuse me a minute, I think I hear Dehlia callin' me. Oh! - Dehlia! Dehlia! - Yes'm? Chicken, Dehlia, where's the chicken? Right here, Ma'am, don't it look good? Mm, mm, lovely, perfectly delicious, Dehlia, throw it out! - Throw it out? - Uh-huh! Zero, run out and get a pig! - Pig? - Pig, yes, we're gonna have roast pork. Make some applesauce and figs, you know me. Oh, Ms. Tibbitt, you can't just catch a pig and dress it with roast pork. Is it? You run the kitchen, don't ask me. Well, go and get the pig. Dehlia, one of ours? Of course one of ours! Must I get Hanna? Yes, Hanna! Don't bother nobody, Dehlia that's the nicest pig we got. A person has to be so careful what they eat. Now something simple like roast pork... Roast pork? Roast pork! Of course there's nothin' worse, you're absolutely right. Just a minute, I think I hear Dehlia callin' me again. I'm always hearin' things. Oh! [sniffing] DehHa! DehHa! - Yes'm? - The roast pork, where's the roast pork? It ain't come yet. Oh, dear! - [pig oinking] - Why, we got.. [Muttering] This "un all right, Miss?" Yes, very cute, isn't it. Turn him loose. - Turn him loose, ma'am? - Eggs, Dehlia, get some eggs. Eggs? And scramble them. No, omelets! [pig squealing] Mary, while you're down there, get some sherry, and please hurry. [pig squealing] Why... get... get him here. Get outta here, get that pig outta this kitchen, get on out! [both shouting] - Get on out! - [pig squealing] She's very pretty, isn't she. Yes, very pretty. I mean she's so attractive, don't you think? Such nice clothes and all. Now, listen! For the hundredth time, I didn't know Mother was bringing Virginia here tonight. I didn't have anything to do with it. Oh, but Jeffrey, you don't understand. I think it's real nice she came along. Uh... Here, let me help you. After all, as your Mother said, you two were practically brought up together. Now, listen, are you gonna stop talkin' about Virginia, or will I have to do somethin' about it? Oh, Jeffrey, I wasn't talkin' about her, all I said was that... Jeff, oh no! Are you gonna stop talkin' about her? Darling, I was only saying that Virginia was a very... Did you call me, Miss Mary? No, Dehlia. [Dehlia sighs] [Bessie] And this one's Dr. Tibbitt and myself when we were married. Course, we were younger then. And on our honeymoon when we went to New York. On my last visit to New York I consulted four doctors about the diffused hepatitis. You know, liver. They're all agreed they've never seen anything like it before. [Chuckles] How nice. And this one's Mary when she was a little girl. Sittin' on my lap, that's me sittin' right here under her. Virginia, my dear, my... oh, yes. Sorry to have been so long, but we had a terrible time finding the sherry. Didn't we, Jeff? And it was right in the bottle all the time. Well, here's to you two oh, [giggles] here's to spring. Well, well, well, here we all are. [chuckles] Hello, dear. Good evening, Mrs. Carter. Good evenin'. I never saw you looking better in your life. Evidently you disagree with all the outstanding doctors of this country and Europe. Emory, what kept you so long, dear, was it an important case? Oh! A big case, the biggest case I've ever had. You know, Dr. Tibbitt, everyone's been so mysterious, they haven't told me yet why I'm here. But that's just it, we weren't gonna tell you until later. Mother! Really, Dr. Tibbitt, if it's anything concerning your daughter and my son... Mother, Mary and I are gonna get married. Why, that... that's impossible! And just exactly why is it impossible? What's the matter with us? Well, my dear, there's a slight difference in family background. Mrs. Carter, I happen to like my family. Jeffrey! We're leavin' this house immediately! I absolutely forbid this marriage! I'm sorry, Mother, but we're gonna get married anyway. Oh! - Oh, my heart. - [glass clatters] Oh, my... oh! Mary, I'd better take Mother home. Yes, I guess you had. - [Mrs. Carter] Oh! - Come along, Mother. - Oh, Jeffrey. - Come along. Oh, Jeffrey. Oh, my heart, Jeffrey. - Oh! - [door thudding] Emory, do something! There's nothing to do! It isn't her heart, Bessie! It's us! [Bessie sobbing] [door thudding] "Dinner is now bein" served. The dining... is... everybody was here just now. It's all that pork and chicken was [muttering] [Mrs. Carter] Mary Tibbitt! She's so disgustingly healthy. I know, Mrs. Carter. And such an ordinary person. Yes, but Jeffrey's got to find that out for himself. Now, I wonder how? Didn't Mary say she couldn't sing very well? Why, yes! Yes, I remember. Oh, with music. [Bessie] "In honor of Miss Mary Tibbitt." Oh, darling, I'm so happy for you. Thank you, Mother. It's mighty nice of Mrs. Carter to want us. Well, of course she wants us, Daddy. I knew she'd come around. It was just the shock when she first heard the good news. Music! Oh, it's no use my going, I can't play a note. Why, Bessie! Remember? Well, maybe if we practiced a little. - All right! - [both laughing] - Ready? - Mm-hmm. [playing piano] ♪ I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls. ♪ - [piano clanging] - Oh. I'm sorry, darlin... We'll try it again, dear. Ready? ♪ I dreamt I dwelt in marble ha... ♪ [piano clanging] Dr. Tibbitt! Gentleman patient, said he want to see you right... Tell him I'll see him in a few minutes. Ah, Doctor, it's about my baby. - Hey, Doc. - Music, Bessie, music! Oh, yes, of course. I'll be right back. [playing piano] ♪ I dreamt I dwelt... ♪ Will you go away! But, Doctor! - Sh, sh! - I've been up all night with her, - just pacing the floor. - Sh! - Pacing. - Sh! - Pacing, pacing the floor. - Shh! hot mustard foot bath. We're not going to have any more guesswork. We're going to do this thing scientifically. Well, now, listen, the old fashioned remedy, you know, works pretty good. If you don't mind, we're going to make a thorough examination from beginning to end. Well, where are you gonna start? We're going to start at the bottom and work up. We're going to sub-divide her into zones. - Zones? - Yes! Now, this... will be zone... one! - Hm. - Mark her! Now, this is... zone... two! Now, the head will be zone... three! Now, zone four, well, we'll get to that later. Now, you hold that! Now, will you have her raise her pedal extremity? Her what? Hoof! Oh! Her foot, sure! Come on, baby, raise your tootsie! [hammer tapping] [hat crunching] Her reflexes are all right. [hat rattling] Hold this, please. [drum banging] Sounds very much like a bass drum. Now for the heart. I really don't think there's anything wrong with her heart. [mouse squeaking] - Come on out! Come out! - Keep quiet! I'm trying to listen to her heart! Yeah, but you better come out, come out quick! Come on! How can I hear anything when you keep talking? I know! I know! But you don't know! Will you get out of here and let me alone, please! Oh! Oh! You better come out! You better come out! She sees a... she see... She sees a M-O-U-♪-E! Come ou... No, wait, no, no! - [Emory] Wait, no, no, wait! - No, no, no, Zenobia! No! Don't you... up, up, Zenobia, get up! Get up, Zenobia, will you get up outta there! You're on the doctor, get up! Get! [muffled shouting] [hammer thudding] There! Now, it's gone! Will you get up! Get up! That's it! Get, now stay up there! [Emory panting] I told you to come out! [Emory gasping] I never had a patient do that to me before! - That's the last straw! - No, no, no! No, you can't go! You can't! You can't go away and leave a poor, dumb animal to suffer like that! Have you no conscience? Have you no... no feeling? Have you no pride? Well, all right, maybe you're right. I got myself into it, I'll finish it. I guarantee she won't sit on you again, I hope. Oh, Doctor, how is her heart? - Perfect. - Oh, that's good. Ah, let me have your trunk. The trunk, baby, that's it. [blows air through lips] [Zenobia snorting] Oh! Oh! Well, anyway, that isn't stopped up! Yeah, I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm sorry. Would you mind getting me that ladder? Oh, sure! Sure, sure, Doctor, sure. A ladder? A ladder? An elephant can't climb a ladder. I'm going to climb the ladder. Oh! Oh, yeah. Stand still! I'm doing the best I can! Oh, I don't mean you, I mean Zenobia. [shouts] - Back, back! Back, Zenobia! - [Emory shouting] Back! Back! This is a fine state of affairs! But Zenobia, this is for your own good! Back, back! Back! Back, Zenobia! Back! Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor. It'll never happen again. Oh! A touch a alopecia generalis. What's that? A slight touch of baldness, but it's nothing. Maybe she's deaf. Say, that's possible. - Hello! - Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Hello! - [trunk thudding] - [grunts] Well, she's not deaf! Oh, that's fine, Doctor. Now, you stop your playing! Do you understand? [Zenobia snorting] [Emory grunting] [sighs] This thing has got me stumped. Yes, me, too, Say! Has an elephant got a knot in its tail? Ah, no! Why? Oh, nothing. [Emory whistling] [Emory whistling] Now, I wonder who did that. Oh. Look! She feels better already! [laughs] Well, you won't have to worry with her anymore. Thanks, Doctor, you did a great job. [Zenobia trumpeting] What's that for? Oh, don't worry about that, that's nothing. She always does that when she wants to pick me up. Come on, baby, up we go! Up! Oh, oh, no! No, no, no, stop! Let go! Hey! Aw, doctor, that's just her way of showing gratitude. She likes ya! I like her, too, but I wouldn't do this to her. Tell her to put me down! Oh, all right! Zenobia, let him down! - Put him down! Put him down! - Nice girl. Ahh! [Groaning] Say, Doctor, I don't know how I'll ever re-pay you for what you've done. Never mind the pay! I never want to see you and that elephant again as long as I live. But she'll always remember. Remember, an elephant never forgets. Yes! But I'm not an elephant! No. Well, not exactly. Back! Back, back, back, Zenobia, back! [shoring] [chain rattling] [shoring continues] [dramatic music] Zenobia! Zenobia, you come back here, come back and get to bed! Zenobia, you know this night air is no good for you. Honey, you're gonna be the prettiest girl at the whole reception tonight. Thank you, Dehlia, now please hurry. Hurry! I've been hurryin' for the last two hours! Oh, Zeke! Where are you? [Zeke] Here I is! - Get the boots shined? - Yes, sir! Oh, that's fine. Now let's put 'em on. Dr. Tibbitt, will I ever turn white? Mm, I'm afraid not, Zeke. Why? Then I'm never gonna be nothin' else, except just what I am, only bigger? Well, what's wrong with being just what you are? Just that all the other little boys around, they can go to parties. Like the party tonight, 'cause they're white, and I can't 'cause I'm not. Listen, Zeke, you don't go to white folks' parties, I don't go to colored folks' parties. But that makes no real difference. - Do you understand? - No, sir. Well, Zeke, it's like this, you know that medicine kit down in my office? Yes, sir! Well, there's black pills in it and there's white pills in it. And there both good kinds of pills. Some people couldn't do without one kind and some couldn't do without the other. - Do you understand? - No, sir. Well, I'll put it another way, then. You know next to that medicine kit, what hangs in that big frame over the desk? Yes, sir! Well, that isn't just about countries. That's about people, all kinds. Like black pills, white pills, red, yellow, all colors. What that tells us is that all people can find life, liberty, and happiness. Do you understand now? No, sir, not exactly. Come here, Zeke. Did you ever own a quarter? No, sir! Well, you go down in that office and learn a little bit of that every day, and when you get it all learned by heart, I'm gonna give you this quarter. Do you understand that? Yes, sir! [Bessie] Emory? Coming, dear! Now, don't you forget. I sure won't.

[man] If you insist Mrs. Carter. But in all the years that I've represented you and your family, I've never been involved in quite this sort of procedure. We have our reasons, Colonel Culpepper. All I'm askin' you to do is to win this case. Oh, I'm sure that'll not be difficult. You remember how I told you to start? Oh, uh... In the first place, Zenobia and I. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I got it, I got it. Well, in the first place, Zenobia and I... Have you drawn up the complaint, Colonel? Oh, yes, yes! I have it right here in my hand. Well, he ain't home. - What? He's not at home? - No! Listen, Sheriff, you've gotta find him. My whole future depends on that elephant. And if I... if I... look! - [dramatic music] - [Zenobia trumpeting] What are you waiting here for?

[Zenobia trumpeting] [crowd gasping] [Clerk] Dr. Tibbitt. Dr. Tibbitt! Well, in the first place, Zenobia and I, we had... Not yet, Professor. Oh, not yet. Do you know where the doctor is? I don't know. I'm so worried. Last time I saw him he hadn't come back yet. He doesn't seem to be here, Your Honor. Well, if he doesn't show up in five minutes, I'll have to hold him in contempt of court. Where's his attorney? He's declined counsel, Your Honor. Jeff, I'm worried. Because he's not here? No, because of this. [Jeffrey] Why, they couldn't do this to him, it isn't his fault. They will anyway. Look at the way the people in the town are acting toward him already. Your Honor, may we proceed? Clerk, call the defendant once more. Dr. Tibbitt. Did someone call me? [crowd laughing] We'll have no levity in this courtroom! Dr. Tibbitt, I'm surprised at your lack of consideration for this court. You will please come in here at once! But, Your Honor, I can't. Dr. Tibbitt, you will do as you're ordered! All right, if you insist. Well, in the first place, Zenobia and I... Sh! I'll tell you when to start. [people murmuring] [crowd gasping] It hardly seems necessary for me to request you to take that... that thing out of here. All right! But I'll have to take out myself with it. I can't conduct the case without the defendant. What about going outside and looking through the window? Very unusual, but I suppose under the circumstances. Thank you, Your Honor. [people chattering] [gavel tapping] You may proceed with your witness. - Ready? - Ready! Well, in the first place, Zenobia and I... Here I am, Your Honor. What are you waiting for? Proceed. Well, in the first place, Zenobia and I have been together ever since she was a teeny, weenie little baby, thirty-five or 40 years old. Why, huh! We were like this together, until that scoundrel came between us. You can't say that about Emory Tibbitt! Why, he's the dearest, most unscoundrely... Well, he is anyway. [people gasping] Take that elephant out of this courtroom and go back where you belong! But, Your Honor, my reputation is at stake, and that man's maligning me. Instruct your client to be more careful in his language. Thank you. [people chattering] You may continue. Oh. Well, in the first place, Zenobia and... Wait a minute, start where you left off. Oh. Yes. Well, it all began one day when Zenobia got a kink. A kink? Well, ah, it had an unfortunate entanglement. Anyway, the poor thing was ill, and I had to do something. So I summoned that small minion over there, I sent him on an errand of mercy, little knowing what lay in store for me. Little knowing I was about to lose the elephant who worked side by side with me all these years. The elephant who had helped me sell the priceless product of my life's effort. A remedy that I brought at the risk of life and limb from the teaming jungles of Borneo, and the burning sands of the Sahara, Step up closely, ladies and gentlemen. We're not interested in your medicine. Ah! But you haven't tried it, Your Honor. Please accept this with the compliments of ♪. Thorndike McCrackle. Stick to the facts, Professor. Oh, yes! Yes, the facts, yeah, you're right. Well, in the first place [clearing throat] That's all, Professor. Does the defense wish to question the witness? Just one question, Your Honor. Professor, who's putting up the money to pay for your attorney? - Why... - I object! Objection sustained. That's all I wanted to ask. Call the next witness. Mrs. Emory Tibbitt. Mrs. Emory Tibbitt! - Am I finished? - Yes, indeed. Be careful, Mother, don't let him get you confused. Confused? Me? [giggles] Ridiculous! [Clerk] Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give in this case now pending before this court is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? [Bessie] I do. Mrs. Tibbitt, where were you on the night of April 29? Let me see, 29. Oh! I remember! I was at that party that Mrs. Carter gave for Mary! Where were you? Well, that night a few of the boys and myself... [crowd laughing] That has nothin' to do with it! Is it true that after the party at Mrs. Carter's you refused to let your husband into the house? Well, that is because... The witness will restrict herself to answering questions. All right, John. [clears throat] Is it or is it not true that you locked your husband out of the house? Well, lots of times a wife has a perfectly good reason for what she does. Do you mean to say your wife never locked you out of the house? Well, only once, and that was when... [crowd laughing] Mrs. Tibbitt, have you and your husband ever quarreled before? Why, no! We get along very well. Course there's no married couple in the world that doesn't have a little family squabble now and then. Why, John, I'm sure even you and your wife have had a little tiff at some time or other. Well, as a matter of fact, last night the wife and I had the darndest fight. [Laughs] - [crowd laughing] - [clearing throat] [laughs] Are you through with the witness? Yes, sir, Your Honor. Has the defense any questions to ask the witness? Do you love me, Bessie? Emory, of course I do. That's all, Your Honor. Mrs. Tibbitt, you will kindly leave the witness chair. Oh, do you want to sit here? Yes, thank you. [crowd laughing] Of course not! Your Honor, may I call the next witness? You certainly may. Mr. Jeffrey Carter. [Clerk] Mr. Jeffrey Carter. Mary, I... I had no idea. [Clerk] Mr. Jeffrey Carter. Goodbye, John. [crowd laughing] [Bessie humming] [Clerk] Do you solemnly swear that the testimony that you're about to give in the case now pending before this court is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? [Jeffrey] I do. Mr. Carter, have you ever seen the elephant show great affection for Dr. Tibbitt? Please answer the question, Mr. Carter. Yes. On the night of your mother's party, did you see the elephant follow Dr. Tibbitt into your house? We're waiting, Mr. Carter. Yes, I did. Did the appearance of the elephant cause your mother great anguish and humiliation? Please answer. Yes or no? Yes. Gentlemen of the jury, it's obvious from the testimony of Mr. Carter, that he's seen the manner in which the defendant has stolen the affection of this elephant, as well as the sorrow which has resulted from his theft. Your Honor, may I interrupt to ask one question? What is it, Dr. Tibbitt? What is the penalty in this state for stealing the affections of an elephant? The penalty in this state for stealing an elephant, is, uh, uh, well, uh, uh... - The... the, um, uh... - [crowd laughing] The... the penalty... the penalty is... [stammering] As a matter of fact, this court declares a recess for a half hour while it digests the evidence. Court adjourned. [people chattering] Emory, I don't like the way everybody's actin', I'm awfully upset. Now, don't worry, Mother, this'll work out somehow. Well, I'll run home and get you an nice cool drink. And some hay for the elephant. [Laughs] Mary, Mary, darling, I'm terribly sorry. But what else could I do? I guess you're right. I guess there's nothin' else you know how to do. Maybe from now on you'd better stick to your mother and forget all about me. [whistling airily] Did pretty well, didn't I? You were terrible. Terrible? I don't think so. - It only took me... - Great Scott! [horseshoe clanking] Imagine, pitchin' horseshoes as though nothing were the matter. If I were he, I'd be havin' a nervous breakdown. Better hang onto that horseshoe, Doc, you may need it for luck. Joe, if you never do anything to be ashamed of, you don't have to worry about being lucky. [men chattering] A ringer, Dr. Tibbitt! [men laughing] Doc, can I see ya a minute? Why sure, Jeff. Ah, take my place, Bill. Sure, Doc. What's the matter, son? Doc, I-I'm all mixed-up. I keep tr yin' to figure this thing out, but it just doesn't add up. Something go wrong between you and Mary? I guess she thinks I listen to other people and do what they want, instead of what I want to do. And what do you think? I don't know what to think. - Come here, Zeke. - [Zeke] Yes, sir. Once I promised you a quarter if you'd learn something. Yes, sir. Do you want to earn that quarter now? Yes, sir. Declaration of Independence, in Congress, July Fourth, 1776. "When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which has connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the Earth, separate and equal stations, to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitles them. A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impels them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new governments, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; But accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are suffterble... sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpation, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security.” Do I get my quarter now? You bet you do! [Chuckles] There. Oh, thank you, sir. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [chuckles] Mother, I'm not going back on the witness stand. Why, Jeffrey! You see, I'm gonna marry Mary. If she'll still have me after this. I don't want to hurt you, Mother. So... so, I won't say what I'm thinkin'. But from now on I'm gonna live my own life, the way I want to live it. I'm sorry, Mother. [Clerk] The Court is about to convene. [people chattering] The Court is now in session. Recall the witness. - Well, in the first place... - Mr. Jeffrey Carter. Zenobia and I... Your testimony's finished. Well give me... Sit here, that's all! Mr. Jeffrey Carter. My son isn't comin' back. If Your Honor so pleases, I should like to call the next witness, Mrs. Carter. Proceed. Mrs. Carter. Your Honor. You will please take the witness stand and be sworn in. I'd rather say what I have to say from here. This is a little irregular, Mrs. Carter. I'll reimburse Professor McCrackle for any damages he may have suffered. I guess I've been very selfish. Even though it made a lot of people miserable, I've always taken exactly what I wanted. I almost ruined my own son's happiness. This is the first time I've ever thought about anybody else. I I'm sorry. Emily, Emily, don't feel like that. Thank you, my dear. Case... dismissed. [crowd] Hooray! [people chattering] - [Zenobia trumpeting] - [people screaming] - Oh, I'm so glad to see ya. - Good evening. Is everything all ready? Oh, yes, we've been ready for hours, just go in. Oh, Emory, Emory. - Good evening, Mrs. Tibbitt. - Oh, good evenin', just go in, won't you. Zero, have you seen the Doctor? Not since dinnertime, or early this mornin', Ms. Tibbitt. Oh, Zero, you'll drive me distracted. Is she all right, Doctor? She's getting along fine. Oh, wonderful. You have nothing to worry about. Oh, thank you, Doctor, thanks. My daughter's wedding! Oh! Emily, be careful! Your hydrophobia! Heart, you know. Heart? [Laughs] There's nothin' the matter with my heart. Oh, of course there isn't, darlin'. Well, to work, to work, to work, to work. To work, to work, to work, to work. [both laughing] [Bessie] Come along, darling. [gentle music] - Do I look all right? - Oh, you look lovely. I remembers when I was a bride. I wish I could forget it, though. Don't start nothing. [Muttering] [music continues] I wonder where Emory is. ["Bridal March" playing] What's a matter, Doctor, is the elephant chasing ya? No! And she won't chase me anymore. But she sure needed me. [music continues] [bright music]
