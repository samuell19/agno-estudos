As-salaam Alaikum. Thank you. LONDON. START T. I. A sync:baozi ÏºÃ× ¡¶The Last Enemy¡·SO1. EO1 And the weather today in London is much the same as it was in Beijing,. although a couple of degrees cooler We are expected to arrive at London Heathrow in around four hours from now. That's as long as we don't get stuck in any holding patterns, which puts usjust over 45 minutes behind schedule. So relax and enjoy the rest ofthe flight. Excuse me. Excuse me. All passengers from flight EZ759, please proceed immediately to security. Mr Ezard? Mr Stephen Ezard? Yes? ID, please. Come with us, please, sir. You're being fast-tracked. This is very helpful. Who laid this on? I have no idea, sir. Is it a wedding or a wetting, sir? Who organised this? All I've got is, er, Mr Stephen Ezard, Beijing flight, going to north London, Highgate Church. It's my brother's funeral. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Can't we go any faster? I really am very late, my plane was delayed. I'm afraid we don't have clearance to break monitored speed, sir. Monitored speed? I've been away... almost four years. You'll be noticing the changes then, sir. But one saying was dear to Michael's heart, 'The insignificant man makes demands on others, the significant man makes demands on himself. ' All of us here today know that Michael was a very significant man. Michael Ezard? Yes. Are you the brother? Yes. We couldn't wait. I didn't know Michael had a brother until today. I didn't think there would be such a large crowd. Those who knew him, loved him. Still, at least you got here in time to throw dirt on the coffin - that's important. I've known Michael for years - a lovely, lovely man, you must be so proud. Yes. We'd lost contact for four years. I knew he was working in some sort of voluntary organisation in the Middle East, but well, I thought he was looking for something more... prop... per... permanent. Michael changed people's lives. What do you do? Michael was like a brother. Well, this is nice. Yeah. Grew up here. Ended up sharing the place with my brother. Er, you haven't, er, forgotten anything, sir? Er, no, I don't think so. Who did you say sent you? Hello? No blood, no girl. Oh, I'm... I'm from upstairs. Ah, a friend of Michael's? His brother. Oh, I didn't know he had one. Batz. Andrew Batz. Stephen Ezard. Come in, Stephen, come in, come in. I moved in about a year ago. I haven't touched the place yet. Um, I've been away quite a long time and, um... I know Michael... likes to have an open house policy... Oh, yes, some guests are noisier than others. I've only met Michael a couple of times but you can tell straight away, he's a lovely man, lovely man. I think some of them take advantage, overstay their welcome. - Yes, Do you know who's staying there now? No idea. I've heard some music, footsteps. Well, I'm sure I'll sort it out. How is Michael? Stay, stay and talk... it might help. No, I'll be fine. Thank you. Who are you? Yasim. Yasim who? Same as you - Ezard. I'm Michael's wife. Well, his widow. I didn't know Michael was married. I knew he had a brother. A famous one too. 'Ezard's Theorem'. There's a woman lying in there, unconscious... Nadir. Nadir? Nadir who? Nadir bint Ahmed bin Saleh Al-Fulani. Well, she looks very ill. She is. I'll enough to need a doctor. I am a doctor. Nadir, we have a visitor, baby. Stephen Michael's brother, which is wonderful, really, really wonderful because what we need most of all is a cook. OK, my love, I'm going to give you a shot of morphine. I've got pictures. She left in a hurry, yesterday. She's dropped something it could be a blood sample. 'Full surveillance - find the girl. ' If you are Michael's wife, why weren't you at his funeral? I had a patient to look after. Medicines to collect. Who is Nadir bint Ahmed bin Saleh Al-Fulani? An aid worker, same as Michael. We all worked for the same charity on a Hepatitis B inoculation programme. What's wrong with her? I don't know. How exactly did Michael...? So, why China? That's where I work best. Because? It's peaceful. It's very... foreign. I haven't got a clue what's going on, the world doesn't intrude, I can concentrate, I'm not distracted by the minutiae of other people's lives. Michael told me something about your work - studying killer bees. Several years ago I developed a mathematical model, the genesis of which was a statistical analysis of insect swarm, in which killer bees played a component, a very small, theoretical component. And all this time I had you in a bee keeper's outfit. Another one of Michael's 'good stories'. Yasim, we have to talk about Michael. All I had was a phone call. What happened? I was, um, in a medicaltent... .. working. I saw him flash past in his jeep. He always drove too fast. He went into the mountains to deliver medical supplies. He hit a land mine. He didn't come back. I'm so sorry, my darling, I shouldn't have left you. I won't leave you again. The blood sample? All taken care of. That's why I had to leave you. The doctor will run tests. We'll hear back from him in a few days. Whoever he is, whatever he is... he's an old one. Police? No. He'd have made six phone calls and taken a dump by now. One of ours? God knows. What's he doing in Nadir Al-Falani's flat? Shit, he's seen us? WEDDING Honey moon. Help me turn her body. It's just air escaping. I can?????How, you can go. Tell me about today. Tell me about Michael's funeral. They drove me out to where he'd been blown up. I collected body parts... what little I could find... Nothing was recognisable. That's when I said my goodbyes. Well? Was it a good funeral? I missed it. Well, most of it and it was Humanist. So there was no vicar, except everybody acted like one. Michael was buried with our parents. I didn't expect anyone to come, but there were hundreds of them from all over the world. And... they loved him... They really loved him. Yeah, Michael had a knack of making everyone think they were special to him. A complete stranger would suddenly feel they'd met a friend for life. I hate him! I hate him! I hate him for dying like that! It was so like him... Roaring away in that stupid jeep. Self-important. He had to take care of everything and everyone! I'm glad I wasn't there today... to see all those brave, smiling faces, hugs and laughter, tears and jokes. That's exactly what it was like - one big, happy Humanist family. All claiming him as theirs. He was mine! It's good I didn't go. I'd have been screaming at them, 'Say something bad. 'Say something nasty, cruel, dirty. 'Say something HONEST!' He never made me feel special. Ever. All I got was resentment. The day I learnt to walk, he went out into the back garden and dug bear traps. I couldn't believe that I was born into a family with him in it. He was loud, chaotic, demanding, self-centred... and he was the reason I spent so much time locked in my room - to escape him. On the plane on the way over, I was dreading having to say something at the church to my imaginary congregation of two because you can't lie at a funeral - standing beside the coffin - you just can't. There was a woman from South America. She'd wrestled her way past crocodiles to get there, but I resented every step that I took to get to his grave. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. God almighty. Why here? The cameras don't work, inside or out. And it's highly unlikely that in here... you'll bump into anyone who knows you. Morning. Good morning. Coffee and an Olympic. Coming up. He's David Russell. A hybrid. Desk and field - highly regarded in both. Extensive Middle Eastern experience, fluent in Farsi. A useful re-tread in the war on terror. Re-tread? Brought out of retirement. All hands to the pump. But he had a falling out with the younger management - apparently they were terrified of him. Coffee. Two years ago he disappeared. There's no record of where he went or what he's been doing. Russell is rather good at disappearing... that and wet operations. Assassination. Christ. Why is he looking for her? We have to assume it's the same reason as us. Then it's got away from us - we have to go wider. We can't carry it between the three of us. You're both wrong. If you look carefully... with his experience, if he had any understanding at all of how explosive this is, he'd have expected us to have the girl's apartment covered, but he didn't. There, see? That's the first time he knew we were in there. So what's going through his mind, is that this is much bigger than he thought. Then he comes back to the surveillance car to show his face. He doesn't want us to make a mistake - he wants us to know exactly who he is. He doesn't know why we're interested in the girl, so he wants us to come after him, and to give it away. Which would suggest both arrogance and a certain desperation to find Nadir bint Ahmed bin Saleh Al-Fulani. Yes, it would. Olympic. Stephen, wait! Hi, there, it's Michael. Leave a message, better still, send money. 'Message for Stephen Ezard. 'This is Bryan Holland. 'I run a company called Inquirendo, 'and we'd very much like to talk to you about funding your work. 'We've sent a car for you. 'The driver should be there with you now. ' 'W-wait, wait a second, please. Fantastic! I'll see them tomorrow. I couldn't leeve Â¤ew -_ ?????what to do - all the formalities. Stephen, I'm used to it, it's part of my job. He's on his way. ????????? It's OK. Thank you... .. for helping me... .. chase death away. Go and get the money. I'll take care of things here. Bryan Holland. Andrew Willcox. I'm a huge fan. I was a couple of years behind you at Cambridge. You were already a legend. Stephen, why don't you bring us up to speed on your work? Um, have you got the time? Good God, man, of course we have. It would be an honour. Let Ric be the Ricy curvature where the Gammas are the Christoffel symbols. The idea is to show that, under the Ricy flow, positive curvature tends to spread outwards, until at infinite time the manifold will achieve constant curvature. Now, let us consider a generalisation of this the form 'f' is a nice smooth function. The flow will develop singularities in finite time , but using a local version of the Gromov compactness theorem, I've been able to get a model of all possible singularities. Fantastic. And that proves what? Um, it's part of a proof... of, um, the affirmation of a conjecture I made earlier. But, the whole proof would take a lot longer to explain... I could if you had the time. It's topology, Bryan, rubber sheet geometry. Stephen's work is well on the way to explaining the shape ofthe universe. And what shape's that? The beauty of what Stephen hasjust shown us is in how the equation explores itself- the harmony of numbers. Think of it as music. No, no, no it's not at all like music. But, to explain it to a non-mathematician, like Bryan. If it's not like music, how does that help? I thought it had something to do with killer bees. Pure research is something that Inquirendo are proud to support, and we would like to fund your research for the next three years. Thank you. That's very generous. How did you know I needed funding? Well, as I'm sure you know, the International Mathematical Union is a hot bed of gossip - who's in, who's out, who's hot, who's not. And the chatter about you is non-stop. The genius who went to ground in China, the youngest mathematician ever to be awarded a Fields Medal, a future Nobel Prize winner - it's great publicity for us. Now, there'sjust one small favour we'd like to ask you in return. Oh? The Victoria bomb - you'd have felt the shock waves of that one all the way to China. It changed the way a lot of people thought. Those that could think for themselves. An atrocity on that scale? People weren't prepared to live with that level of insecurity any more. And that's where we can help. We're in the national database business. And this... is the future of that business. Now, any expansion of the National Register or DNA databases has always had the anxiety brigade jumping up and down. So we were left with national databases that didn't talk to each other. Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before they did. The Victoria bomb, and the others, just hurried the inevitable along. Well, here she is - the Intrusive State Machine - Big Brother. A simple lap-top - it's all about what Tallulah here can access. And what she can access is T-I-A. Sorry? TIA - Total Information Awareness. TIA is the entire UK on one database - birth to death, day-to-day, up-to-date, and in realtime. A completely new generation of interaction absolute surveillance. With TIA, all the walls come down. Yeah, with encryption it guarantees only the right people have it, so they can get to know all about the wrong people. Self-funding in ten years, with strict government controls on data sales to the private sector. That's what Tallulahs will be doing from this room. And all linked to your ID card. What has any of this got to do with me? TIA is about to become law, and it should be a shoo-in. We designed and built it, so we've got the contract to run it. Naturally we liaise with the government, and we want you to be our man in Whitehall... just to make sure it is a shoo-in. Me!? As a sort of mascot, you know, to calm last minutejitters, both inside government and the media. Your early statistical model work at Cambridge - it fits this like a glove. You're perfect for it. The genius who gave the world Ezard's Theorem, the man tipped for the Nobel, supports TIA. I'm not tipped for anything. I know nothing of TIA. just put your name to it. ?????????? ?? I don't have an opinion about it Way Ol' 6|âIOthâ¬|?? Oh, you won't have to do very much at all... We'd crib you up on everything. I couldn't think of anyone less suitable. I'm not remotely political. I hate talking, explaining... people. Perfect. You won't hang around to make a career out of it... The bees won't even know y0u've been away! Unless you do this for us, it won't be possible for us to fund your work. Give us a few weeks, and we'll give you three years' financial support. Thank you. But... no. He won't be needing a car. Arrogant bastard. As if earning a living's beneath him. Perhaps 'mascot' was wrong. 'Shape ofthe universe. ' Wanker doesn't know what makes the world go round. Ezard's Theorem - complete bollocks. It isn't. It'll be a disaster if it comes out he turned us down. He'll come round. Taxi! ID, please, sir. - Ezard... Stephen Ezard. - Yes. The underground system won't be working for another hour at least. You're better off on foot, sir. Thank you. Yasim! Yasim? Yasim? Yasim? Stephen! Come in, come in. Someone has been in the apartment, this morning. Did you hear anything, see anything? Think! From about ten. I can't have been gone more than two, three hours. No. Sorry. Not a thing. Did they take much? It's as if no-one was ever there. Stephen. Come in, come in and talk about Michael. I think someone needs tea and a hug. No! No, no, thank you. Well, you could just look a little pleased to see me. I'm so sorry about Michael. And for not making it to the funeral. How was it between you two? There was always that re-assurance living with you, that if needed... the kitchen could be turned into an operating theatre at a moment's notice. And here I am messing it up. just like old times, hey? Eleanor, this is very kind of you, it's just that today's been a little bit confusing and... Is that why you passed up on a generous offer of three years' worth of funding? The car that picked you up from the airport and took you to the funeral - that was me. I have clearly paid more attention over the years to your brilliant career than you have to mine. I'm a government minister now. Oh. And it's my job to make sure TIA gets onto the statute book. I recommended you to Inquirendo. They jumped at the idea, ofcourse. But surely you know me better than anyone, I... Social charm and the ability to mix with colleagues is a distinct disadvantage. . You'd be perfect. - As a mascot? Eat. And then I've got a treat for you. .. Thank you. Thank you. A couple of rogue tenors, and the Rex Tremendae was a little lumpy, but not bad, not bad at all. Stephen, they're school children. Why did we have to go through that security sheep dip to get in here? The audience - a mix of the Commons and the Lords. We're here for a show of solidarity. Come and meet some people. Don't worry, they're not politicians. GENERAL CHAT|'ER The school lost six children in the Victoria Station bombing. Out ofthe 213 killed, nearly 30 were children. Tonight was a celebration of courage, an act of defiance against barbarism. Hand wipe? They're antiseptic. I am who I am. I wouldn't want you any other way. We stop a lot of atrocities, Stephen, but every time one gets past us we put pieces of information together to understand how, who, why. TIA will help us put that information together, before it happens. TIA finds needles in haystacks. People can'tjust disappear or melt away. Look, I understand how important your work is, and to do great work, you can only think about mathematics. It'sjust so distracting. I know, and I know how hard you fight to keep a pure mind. Yeah. But it's only for a few weeks. Having you on-board will really help calm last-minute jitters. I wouldn't expect you to put your name to something you haven't examined first. Take a look at what we've got, pull it apart. At least think about it. Russell is at an address we've got for Michael Ezard. Ezard has a brother - Stephen, who's also registered there. Give me five minutes, babe. It's territory we went over weeks ago. Whatever his motive, it looks as if he's two steps behind us. If the data we have on the girl is correct, she's probably no longer with us. Hot or cold, we need her. The worst outcome is her dead and not surfacing. I've been thinking about what you said. Thinking about those children... Me working on TIA - I wouldn't want any civil servants looking over my shoulder, I'd need to be left alone. - I'd make sure of it. - And I'd have to have complete access. Be able to go anywhere, look at anything, anybody. No state secrets, but... otherwise you'd have complete freedom. Then I'll take a look at TIA... see what it can do. You're a notionalthree, but they've dumped you in a six office. I'll try to get you bumped up, but it's always a shit fight. Thank you. Internal directory. Every office has a number - all the numbers are listed. Guard it with your life. The place makes no sense without it. I won't be needing it. I'm not planning on staying for long. What I do need, as soon as possible, is clearance to use the TIA database. Well, if you're down for it, you'll get it. If not, it's a lock out. And that's the stairway to heaven. The link to Number Ten. And this is your perch. Very much a six. Still, a room of your own - that's impressive. Your key to TIA. You've been validated. Basement level, room 759.

You can tell even from a mug shot. - Yes. Md hm- worked for a medical charity. Ijust opened up the employee data. BLEEP 98.6. Normal... for you. You always did run a little hot. One ofthe camps Michael was working in, it's now become quarantined. Some sort of deadly mystery virus. But not contagious from this distance - it's not, even to you. What's the map? It's where Michael died. This shows all the known land mines in the area. The nearest is over 30 miles from where Michael was supposed to have driven into one. That's what's so horrendous - they can be anywhere. Are you spying on the neighbours? No, I told you I'm testing the system against what I already know. It's a local authority database. The flat below us is listed as, um, unoccupied whereas in fact it's inhabited by a rather large and creepy individual.

Makes a name for himself- Ezard's Theorem - a total academic, not political, but that's where he meets Eleanor Brooke. - Eleanor Brooke. -?????? I looked into her vetting. They were together for five years. Brooke goes off into politics, and as far as I can make out he went into killer bees. Similar interests, then. Found the pressures of early success difficult, hated academic rivalry. His theorem was brought into question. Doesn't enjoy conflict, escapes to China, returns for his brother's funeral. He's been very helpful. - Yasim Anwar. Bosnian. - we missed her completely - Yasim Anwar. She's Michael Ezard's wife. And we didn't know he was married. Desert weddings don't always find their way onto databases. Is Stephen Ezard linking Yasim Anwar to the girl? He's looking for both of them, and in his search for the girl he only looked at morgues Yasim Anwar. Bosnian. we missed her completely - So she's dead? Well, he obviously thinks so, but he doesn't know where the body is. Well, why does he want to find it? What do we know about the wife? Turkish mother, father a Bosnian Muslim. She worked in the same camps as her husband and Nadir. She entered the UK a few weeks ago. There's nothing else on her. I'll keep digging. And so is Ezard. He's looking into his brother's death. He's established that it wasn't in a land-mine area. How much does he really know? The way he's turning everything over, I'd say very little... and he hasn't once looked over his shoulder. Don't block him. Keep on his shoulder, key stroke him, everything he touches. He could give us a lot more. - request- Stephen Ezard. The first time I ever set eyes on you, I knew I would spend the rest of my life with you. I worship you... and I love you. I fell into your eyes, Michael Ezard. I want your children... and I can't wait! - I love you! - I love you. - I love you! - I love you. No, I love you! We are not pursuing a policy of total security, but we are committed to making our country as safe as is reasonably possible, and to do so, it is vital that we introduce TIA. This is precisely the argument put forward for the introduction ID cards, and they have not increased the safety of this country by one jot. With respect, Lord Cawston, the police, the security services, the overwhelming majority of the public would disagree with you about ID cards. Every opinion poll... But what the public need to know is that if TIA becomes law, then every person's card will not only show who they are, but will monitor every single second of their lives, both public and private. That really isn't the case. But what is perfectly clear is that we need the best intelligence that we can get. It has been a huge sea-change from the society that we lived in 10, 15 years ago. But the only important right that will be lost with this bill is the right to disappear, that's all. The public will want reassurance on cost, and the fact that these databases, have so far, been an absolute nightmare. Stephen? Perhaps you'd like to join in. Yes, em... Mr, er... Gibbon says, is quite correct. They're a complete nightmare. When governments manage them, that is. Even when they're contracted out they micro-manage them to death, and the costs goes through the roof. But TIA, it could work, it will work. Yes, when handled by the right people in the private sector. That's why we... But I'm not sure I agree, having read this, this is such a sea-change from where we were 10, 15 years ago, not at all. I mean Inquirendo... they have known about each and every one of us for years, all the important information, your income, your diet, how much alcohol you consume, what books you read, how much your house is worth, your last three addresses, who you phone, who phones you, where you travel to, where your children go to school. It would take about four minutes for them to do a complete breakdown of any one of us, and predict with a fair degree of certainty, anything up to 95%, what our attitudes would be to law and order, change, risk, what kind of person we're likely to marry, the exam grades our children will achieve, where we are on any day, our life expectancy and the amount of tax your estate will yield when you die. ?????? According to this, anyone who thinks TIA is alien to this country has been asleep for several decades. These people have been making a fortune out of prying into your lives and you couldn't legislate against them or their type if you tried, not unless you ban credit cards and the Internet, which would be rather, em... totalitarian.

Freezing image. Preparing facial recognition software. Hello, Turney. He's been at it for ten straight hours. The girl must have died in his apartment. Yasim Anwar and an unknown male smuggled her out in a carpet, and drove her away in a van. An unknown male? We're onto it. We've already located the van, abandoned on waste ground, burnt out. Ezard managed to trace Yasim Anwar to a meeting she had at Kings Cross a few days ago. - Who with? - It's not good. Professorjohn Moreton. Professorjohn Moreton? Professorjohn Moreton? My name is Stephen Ezard. Can I have a word? - What about? - Yasim Anwar. You met her a few days ago at Kings Cross Station. Ezard, you say? - Yes. - Michael Ezard's brother? Yeah, you knew him? We met once, briefly. Look, Fm in??hurry- ????did you meet my brother? I met him at one ofthe camps - that's where I met Yasim. They'd just got married. We just spent an evening together.???????? You met Yasim again on the 18th of this month. It's a date I find difficult to forget - it was my brother's funeral. Odd, don't you think, that his wife didn't make it, she was too busy meeting you. Yes, I met her on my way home from work, was purely by chance. No, it was planned. I can show you the CCIâV footage, ?????????? if you like. You have to look closely. It's difficult to see on this screen, but on a big screen, it's clear she gives you something, slips it to you - a package. Something to test perhaps, a blood sample? Absolute nonsense. I think it was a sample taken from Nadir bint Ahmed bin Saleh Al-Fulani. She was very ill but she was still alive when Yasim gave you the sample, but she died later that night - perhaps she died from the same disease people are dying from in the camp where you met Michael and Yasim. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I think you do. I know all about you. If I had a blood sample I wanted tested for some awful disease, you'd be the first person I'd contact. Oh, for GOd's sakes, help me! Where's Yasim? I have no idea. I was with her for all of two minutes. Look, you say you're Michael's brother. If you are, then I'm really sorry for you. As I said, I only met Michael once but it was clear he was a good man, kind, generous. But I have no idea what you're talking about, and no interest in pursuing it. When exactly did you know about Moreton? Not long before telling you, George. It would be a huge mistake to withhold information from me. So we have to assume Yasim Anwar gave a sample of the dead girl's blood for Moreton to test. We've found Yasim Anwar. Moreton phoned her. She's keeping out of sight. As far as we can tell, she's on her own. Then we must deal with her and Moreton, quickly. And hope to God there's no-one else in the loop. I'm afraid God isn't being very helpful on that front. A few days ago, Dutch police detained a group of illegal immigrants. Nine altogether - a husband and wife, their two children and five other men. They were handed over to Dutch immigration who screened them and identified them as being from a camp on the Afghan/Pakistan border. Immigration acted correctly and isolated them from the other illegal immigrants they were holding. Unfortunately the chain of command then broke down. Someone interpreted special handling in their own unique way, loaded the refugees into a mini-bus and drove them to a rather good hotelfor the night. Needless to say, there were nine no-shows for breakfast. Apparently, your people have someone inside the Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst. Dutch intelligence. Given the background of the refugees and the likelihood that they were en route to the UK, your person forwarded on photos and biometric details, just in case any of them were of special interest. Eight of them are not, number nine clearly is. God almighty! If we were courageous enough, if we thought through what was best for this country in the long term, we would see this as a great opportunity. Analysing. Professorjohn Moreton. Nationality, British.
