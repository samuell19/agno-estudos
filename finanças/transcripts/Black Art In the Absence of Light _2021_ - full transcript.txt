The black artist in America has had to put up with a great deal. It's not been simply a matter of mastering the art while surviving as a person. This has been the experience of most white artists, of course. For the black artist it has also been a matter of being taken seriously as an artist and as an individual. Last week, a major historical survey of black art by blacks in America called Two Centuries of Black American Art opened at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. David Driskell, Professor of Art at the University of Maryland and formerly chairman of the Art Department at Fisk University in Nashville has organized this show. Incidentally, it opened last year in LA as a bicentennial exhibition and it drew overflow crowds. 1976 doesn't seem like that long ago, but it was remarkable that David Driskell could mount an exhibition called Two Centuries of Black American Art. Because up until that point, you really do not have an exhibition which is authored by a black curator, which talks about the history and the contemporary manifestations of black art production in the visual arts. It just didn't exist. For the most part the general public was not that aware of the contributions that African-American artists had made to American culture in general in the 19th or even the 20th century. It was a surprise to most people when you come up with a list of 50 to 100 black artists who had been working all the time. They said, "Well, we've never heard of these." Well, of course not, there's no publication. There's no exhibition. What David did was he said: "This is black art. It matters." "And it's been going on for 200 years, deal with it." BLACK ART IN THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT Mr. Driskell, you take issue with the fact that it has been called an exhibition of black art, or we have been describing it this morning as the history of black art. Why do you not think of that as being black art, so to speak? Well, first of all, when one says black art, it more or less isolates the black artist from the mainstream of American art. Even though this has happened throughout the years, with critical acclaim, historical analysis, et cetera, the black artist has not attempted to set himself apart. He is trying to be part and parcel of the main stream. But aren't you setting them apart in effect by putting the show together with just black artists? Only because he has not had an audience with a majority culture and because an exhibition of this nature gets his work before the public. Had this exhibition not being organized, many of the artists who are shown here never would have been seen. The show opens in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There was a lot of resistance, even at that museum. There was some who said: "No, we shouldn't be even involved with this." And yet when push came to shove the board and the curators agreed that Two Centuries of African-American Art would be a good idea. I guess it was a teaching moment for them. At the same time, I had a chance to really say, "This is something that ought to be done" "because the American Canon is not complete without it." When you understand how difficult that was, what a triumph it was that it was actually done, then you start to understand the enormous struggle and journey that this country has been on to feature and to display and to honor the work of black artists. What Driskell did is he demonstrated absolutely that there was a lineage, there was a history and that history was filled not only with painting and sculpture, but also the decorative arts, architecture, drawings. It really gave us this enormous sense of the legacy of African-Americans. I would have been 21 years old in '76. And I saw that show. The scope of the show, the amount of work that was available that you'd only seen in books before. And so for an artist, I mean always seeing the work in person, seeing the real thing matters a lot. I was there. I remember the electricity. I remember the fact that it was packed. There were lines down Wilshire Boulevard. People from all over coming for that opening. It was just spectacular. After the count was taken and after that exhibition closed there and went to the High Museum in Atlanta the next year, they found out that more people attended that exhibition than any other exhibition originated in the United States. The show opens and it travels to Dallas, it travels to Chicago, it travels finally to the Brooklyn museum and it sends a message. And what it says is that these are the manifestations of African-American artistic brilliance over two centuries. Artists who were still practicing, who were living, Richard Mayhew, Lewis Jones, Selma Burke, Richmond Barthe, Charles White, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, when they saw all of their work together, it was like a homecoming. I didn't attend the show. I was too young. Maybe I did. I wouldn't remember, but I remember the book. The book was in my home. It was in my sister's bedroom. These were images that I saw before I could really say the names. They were just sort of imprinted in me. And there was definitely a sense of communication education I was getting from those images because you have to remember there were very few positive images of black folks that were widely available. The artists of that time, not only were presenting black people, they were presenting nuanced, idiosyncratic, abstract imagery. I just feel a sense of belonging when I look at this book. My community of black American artists that come before me have created the ground for me to build on. It's a beautiful thing. That's what this book and this exhibition and what David Driskell has done represents for me. I grew up in a home that had the work of Charles White, Hale Woodruff, Faith Ringgold, Elizabeth Catlett. Those were works that were around my home, so I felt they belonged to me. I felt ownership of those images because they were a part of my intimate and immediate space. When I was in junior high school, I got a summer scholarship to take a drawing class at the Otis Art Institute. The drawing teacher had a book that he put on the opaque projector. It was Images of Dignity, the drawings of Charles White. Because prior to that almost all of the artists I had encountered in our history books were European. When I was 15, the first oil painting I made was in the style of Charles White so that I could understand exactly what it was he was trying to do, how he used form, how he used color and tone, and to try to make an original work that did some of the same kinds of things that he did without copying a work that he had made. You train yourself to a certain way of seeing form and understanding form by copying what somebody else did. At another point, you break free from that, because then you can do your own thing. When I met Charles White, one of the things that stuck with me that he said was that whenever you made work it ought to be about something, and it ought to be about something that matters because all of the work I was doing had some relationship to the history of art. It seemed to make a lot of sense that it also should have a lot to do with the history of black people. That's what I set myself to do, to make pictures that had historical relevance in terms of the story, the narratives told, but also because they had a relationship to the way in which the narrative of painting as an activity developed over time. I think that Kerry James Marshall has all but redefined the whole concept of what black art is about. I will say he had the audacity to concentrate on just the black subject and not bring all these other elements in. And I think it's fascinating, not only from the point of view of what black people feel about themselves, but it's intriguing to whites as well. In the history of painting that we are introduced to, you don't find many images of black people in pictures. You certainly don't see a lot of images of black people making pictures. At the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century, this notion that representation was a useless artifact of old fashioned ideas about what it meant to make art has sort of set in and people started thinking that abstract painting is a more advanced form of painting than representational painting. And that's what abstraction sort of says in a way that representing yourself is no longer a viable approach. But I don't look at it that way. There's work that needs to be done using the black figure in painting as a meaningful part of the historical narrative. Kerry James Marshall was a student of mine. He made a very good sketchbook in my class and he was a good artist. One of the exercises she had us do in that class was to make a collage. We had to make a collage and then to bring that collage back again the next week and to have it changed and then to bring it again and change it again, so that you never really became too attached to not make everything you do seem so precious that it can't be transformed, modified or improved. I was very interested in non-Western philosophies and the spiritualism and the images that they used. I had seen a Black Girl's Window before. It was certainly an image that was in the back of my mind. When I look back at that work, it certainly has a relationship to a painting I did in 1980 that was really transformative for me and set me on the path to doing the work that I'm doing now. And I made a painting called The Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self, which is a black figure against a black ground. It was the first time I had used this simplified, reductive representation of a black figure. And so that painting was the one that established the black figure as a mode of operating for me. One of the things I was trying to do was to embody in a picture the concept that Ralph Ellison had l aid out in his novel, Invisible Man. He describes the condition of invisibility as it relates to black people in America. This condition of being seen and not seen simultaneously, and that's what I think a black figure against a black ground, where if you change the color temperature of the black, it creates enough separation so that you can alternately see, and then sometimes not see the figure that's present there. I started creating the sense of volume in those figures by using the gray scale. You take black, you add white to it you can create a gray scale and then you can actually start doing modeling with values. Black is not the absence of color. Black is a particular kinds of color. If I went to the paint store, and I bought black paint, I could buy three different variations of black paint. I could buy an ivory black. I could buy a carbon black and I could buy an iron oxide black or something that's called Mars Black. And if you look at each one of those colors, they are not the same thing. This is the full range of the black flesh tones. They're seven. Every one of these tones is on the later figures. Every one of these colors is on there. They all look the same, but when you stack them on top of each other, the variations start to become more pronounced. I can end up with six, seven, eight, or nine different colors that are all made from black. That means I have a pallet that's as complex and as broad in its range as any other color that's on the spectrum. I think in general, the paintings have been really well received, but there's a lingering controversy around the sort of unequivocally black kind of emphatically black figures. I wouldn't have done them if I didn't feel it, but I tend to think that having that extreme color, that kind of black, is amazingly beautiful. There's a lot of overlap in terms of the structure between the way artists handle color and the way musicians handle color and note and tone and all of that. Because you use the same kind of language. It's tone, it's texture, it's color, it's intensity. It's all basically the same sort of structural language. I found my own sound, I found my own tone. Very often something that we wouldn't even consider major, like a family picnic, or the barbershop, how we live, what we do, he kind of popularized the ordinary and in so doing, he made it his own personal statement. We see ourselves in so many different ways because he's looking at every aspect of our being. The first major exhibition that focuses on black art or cultural production before Two Centuries of Black American Art is Harlem on My Mind by the Met in 1968, which received a huge backlash from the community itself. Why? It was not authored by anyone who looked like the subjects of that exhibition, yet framed it almost in an anthropological framework, which was the sights and sounds of Harlem from the 1900s to 1968. It did not take into account the wealth of cultural and artistic production emerging. That was shocking. For all of the desires of the curators, they are missing the mark. Mr Hoving, what do you think of the exhibit? -Well, I personally like it. -Why? I like it because I think it is true, I think it is an honest portrayal of a very difficult subject, which is millions of people living in one area or a large area of New York City over a period of about 70 years. Some people, especially some Harlem citizens have criticized the exhibition. They've said, it's not art. It's all photography. They've said that the Harlem people, Harlem born people were not intimately involved. They've said it's too slick and that it lacks sensitivity. I know some people have said that. On the other hand there've been others that have been on the advisory committee and working for many months who said that they thought it was moving and they thought it was powerful where it should be powerful and soft and lyrical where it should be. These are diametrically opposed opinions, we're going to get a lot of that. And I think that's good. Harlem, as a kind of fanciful, mystical, magical subject was fine for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the artists who were doing the work, who were walking the walk were somehow irrelevant to the story. With one exception and that exception is that they had included the photographs of James Van Der Zee. The fact that they included him turned out to be a revelation because Van Der Zee's work documented much of the cultural day-to-day life of Harlem, the rituals and ceremonies of people who lived there and his name became a name we all knew and the content of what he did became known to people. My reaction was that if the Metropolitan Museum wanted to really give a real depiction of what black artists had been doing in the period of the Harlem renaissance and thereafter, why not deal with the art? Doing the Two Centuries gave me a chance to bridge the gap to a certain extent between what I thought the Met should have been doing from day one. People like Romare Bearden, Benny Andrews were out protesting as well as people from the community because it was not reflective of Harlem. Why are museums so resistant to opening their doors to artists of color and particularly African-American artists? For the first time perhaps ever I think people really started to think of their museums as being their museums, as belonging to them in a different way. Faith Ringgold was a prime agitator in this time period. She was protesting at the Whitney, protesting at the Met, protesting all around the city. We are black, but we are equals. I believe thoroughly and completely in freedom of speech and no one's going to change that. I'll just stay out till I get in. I met Faith Ringgold when I was in graduate school at Syracuse. What I heard was this, that she had gone to the Studio Museum in Harlem and tried to get a show. And Studio Museum did not give her a show. For whatever reason, there weren't a lot of women back in those days who were getting solo exhibitions at the museum. And she had all these big paintings she couldn't get shown in New York. And so she started doing these soft sculptures and she would take the soft sculptures and she would lecture on women artists not only black women artists, but on women artists in general, because she understood that it wasn't just an issue about black artists, it was an issue of gender as well as race. I was not invited to sit down with the men who were in the struggle with me. I realized I was really doing the right thing by becoming a feminist and trying to start a feminist movement in the art world. Faith Ringgold is an artist who hasn't received the recognition she deserves in part because of the form that she decided to use but also because of just how incendiary her political style was, her paintings in particular. Her political work also had such an invective that some places weren't willing to be that radical. I did what I wanted to do and paid the price. I think it's also partly that she is extremely courageous, ahead of her time, very fierce in her work, loving in her work. She doesn't accept anyone else's leadership about how art should be, which by the way, I think is what it means to be an artist. One of the great American artists, Richard Mayhew, was part of Two Centuries. His work was a continuum of sorts. It was in the tradition of the great black American landscape painters of Bannister, of Duncanson, of others that we think of when we say America the Beautiful. My paintings were based on mood space, feeling of time and mood of the moment. It's a joy. It's like a dance. They look like landscapes, but they're mind scapes. What we mean by mind scape? All internalized thinking and feeling. I started painting very, very young. I used to see painters and I used to go to the museum and watch them paint. And it was fascinating watching the magic wand as you color, the dip in paint and images come out the other end on the canvas. That kind of thrilled me seeing that and that kind of challenged me about the whole idea of painting, the mystique and the magic of it. I was drawing all the time, constantly drawing. How I learned to draw I can't imagine, because I could draw almost anything very early on. I went to study at the Art Academy in Florence, Italy, and I went to study at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. I met Spiral when I came back from Europe. In 1963, Mayhew joined the Spiral Group, founded by painters Romare Bearden, and Norman Lewis in response to the civil rights struggle. They discussed the plight of blacks in America and the direction African-American art should take. The legacy that they've left is unbelievable. They were very special people. They weren't just artists, these were the mentors of the future of American society. Spiral began in Romare Bearden studio, the fifth floor of his Canal Street loft. Spiral came into being in 1963 at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. And in fact, they got together because there was an idea that there should be a group of black artists who should go to the March on Washington. The question became how can artists engage with the civil rights movement, artists who were working in abstract means and artists who were more overtly political. And Spiral was trying to find a way to create a bridge between these two seemingly separate worlds. And it was really the first major group of black artists that assembled since the '40s. When they got together, they really discovered that they had an enormous amount to talk about. There was Hale Woodruff, Charles Alston, Richard Mayhew, Romare Bearden. Emma Amos was the only woman they permitted into the group. I tried to join Spiral and they told me no. Didn't you write a letter to Romare Bearden asking him to join? Yes, I did. -What he did is critic your work. He never responded to the questions. He basically said: "You need to go back to the drawing board." The final line was something like: "In time, your work will find its own friends." There you go. I didn't ask them for a critique. I had all the credentials they had and more. The fact that Norman Lewis is part of it is an important signal here. Norman Lewis asked a question of those gathered at one of the meetings. "Is there a Negro image?" is how he put it. What is a black aesthetic? Is there one? The fact that Norman Lewis is asking the question for me is interesting because if you teach the history of modernism, you have to teach about Norman Lewis' work. He becomes a kind of metaphor for how difficult it is to engage with black abstraction. Norman Lewis was one of the artists in Spiral. He was about spiritual painting, not painting on the canvas. You're inside the canvas. You're inside of the painting, painting out. When I met this group, there wasn't just artists. There was composers and writers and that was fantastic. Reginald Gammon was a graphic designer. He taught Romare Bearden how to do paste-ups, cut out the right pieces and pasting them together. That was the first Romare Bearden collage. Now the gallery saw what Romare Bearden was doing and they clapped and applauded the fact that "this is what you should continue to do". So he took off in that direction. That was the beginning of the whole collage development. The story that I've heard is that Romy brought this brown bag of scraps to one of the meetings one day and he tried to get some of the artists interested in doing a collage, Norman Lewis, Emma Amos, Mayhew, and he said none of them were really into it. He said they all were doing their own thing and he didn't mean that pejoratively, he just meant that nobody was interested in this collaborative work. Romy continued to work on his collages and one of the artists from Spiral came and saw the work and said: "You know what?" It was Reginald Gammon. "You ought to photograph that and blow it up." And so that's how he came upon taking those small collages and blowing them up and they became his projections, which was the work that really was a milestone for him. I started working on this piece last week and wasn't sure as to where I was going to take it. Bearden was the main inspiration for my collage work and I did a piece in the 70s after he came to visit me at Fisk. And I called it Homage to Bearden. And I exhibited it in New York in 1980. He came to the exhibition and he saw it and he said: "I'm taken with the notion that you like what I do well enough" "to kind of celebrate it," "but what you're doing there is not David, it is more of Romy." And he went over to another piece that I had done and which I had torn the pieces. He cut his out a lot. I had torn to pieces and he said: "You're using collage there and that's you." He said: "That's your voice." And only a friend would tell you that. Hilton Kramer, the art critic for the New York Times, has had a rather mixed review of your show, saying that it was not generally of the highest quality. -Does that disappoint you? -No, not at all. I expect that from what one refers to as a mainstream critic. In many cases, these persons are not familiar with what we might refer to as the black experience. They don't know what it's like to suffer injustices or what it's like to live in the poverty that many of these artists experienced. Consequently, they have no real sensitivity, no real feel for what is has taken for these artists to achieve what they achieved. I got to throw out props to David Driskell at this moment because he got all sorts of flack from the New York Times, from various mainstream media people, people who are supposedly authorities on art, who did not know anything about African-American art. And he provides this very, very important lesson. I'm looking at African-American art historically, in a more complex way. And he fought real resistance on the parts of institutions to say: "There is something else that we can show." "There's something else that we can engage with that shows" "a much more complex side of both modernism and American art." No one had been accustomed to seeing black artists or black historians on television talking about black art and said: "Black art, what is it?" Even the critics, Hilton Kramer, who was just so taken with the notion that we had the audacity to be talking about black art. And my response was: "Who is Hilton Kramer?" It wasn't an exhibition that was for everybody. It wasn't supposed to include everybody. It was supposed to be a cross section of work that had been made in the United States over the 200 years up until that time. The selection process was not an easy one. First of all, you realize that you're going to be subjecting yourself to criticism because people are going to say: "Why'd you leave such and such a person out?" You have to accept that when a curator does an exhibition, it's going to be limited to the scope that the curator has imagined. And if it doesn't include everything I like, that's not particularly problematic for me because I expect that there would be other exhibitions to follow. I think it was probably the first major modern exhibition which brought the black subject period to the attention of the American public. I came up with the notion that in order to do it properly and to do it historically, I ought to talk about the fine arts tradition of portrait artists, artists like Joshua Johnston from Baltimore in the late 1700s or early 1800s. The assumption was that there were no black artists, first of all, but those who considered themselves artists were not capable intellectually or practically of delivering a product that fitted the so-called European Canon. And so when artists like Johnston came along, people started buying his portraits. Artists like Robert Duncanson came along and people saw the beautiful landscape and said: "He's painting within the boundaries of the Hudson River School tradition." Edward Mitchell Bannister a little later and they said: "Well, he's very much like the Barbizon painters out of France." Those artists from the past really influenced my work. I think it's important for us, those that are younger to constantly mention and bring up the names of those that have opened doors before us. I'm an artist, a black artist, African-American artist and I'm an artist just in general. I wanted to go to college and play baseball, I wanted to play ball. Then I realized that that was a dream and I went back towards where my mother guided me and I ended up going to art school. Went to art school thinking I was going to study something like graphic design and then I heard a lecture from an artist and I remember hearing about the artists talking about his work and he was having so much fun that I said: "No, I need to make art, make objects." And then I just went full throttle towards that. I see myself as a vessel and things come through me I found an old piano shop in my neighborhood and I just remember these guys tearing out these piano keys and throwing them away and it just struck me like: "No, don't throw those away." So I collected maybe close to 500 sets of piano keys and I didn't know what I was going to do with them, but I remember bringing them into the studio and dropping them on the floor and right then and there that was the piece. The piano keys basically turned into the ocean and I was thinking about the connections between the oceans. It was a combination of that plus the experiences of me as a kid, going fishing with my father and my father would go so far out in sea to the point where we couldn't see land. And it just reminded me of that experience of being lonely. But that's also based on those that were lost at sea during the Middle Passage. And the figure itself was like a bust, that is it was like a death mask. He loves the materials that he's using and it's paint and it's glass and it's photographs and it's bits of paper and it's fabric. And he has an ability to bring all of those fragments together. It's telling a story, it's telling us about our past, and it's telling us something about where we're going. Radcliffe Bailey for me, represents the wonder and joy of an artist. This is where I pray. This is where I think about the future, I think about the past, I ask questions. I have to separate myself from everyday life when I start working. I have to tune out everybody, everyone. Sometimes it's in the middle of the night. It's probably around midnight. I kind of come in here when I can actually hear nothing moving around. I just want to create beauty. All painting is about light. The obsession with light is at once visual, religious and erotic. The fact that you could take a hairy stick and colored paste and through the act of your mind and your hand you cook something into being that stands in as a representative of someone that you love, a landscape that you like... It's like alchemy. This week the official portraits of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle were revealed. To be the first African-American painter to paint the first African-American president of the United States is absolutely overwhelming. I think his portrait of Obama in the National Portrait Gallery is both beautiful and it's a challenge. What I always struck by whenever I saw his portraits was the degree to which they challenged our conventional views of power and privilege. There's something about that portrait which is really rich, full and exciting in a way that none of the other portraits of presidents are. I googled portraits of presidents and there they were, all of them, all of the terrible, terrible portraits of presidents, and they were mostly really conservative and really boring and it got me thinking about how really far the envelope got pushed. I think what Kehinde understood was the stakes were different. When you have two centuries of straight white men who are president and then you have Barack Obama, that portrait better be different. There were a number issues that we were trying to negotiate. I tried to negotiate less gray hair, I tried to negotiate smaller ears. Struck out on that as well. I showed up in 2016 while he was still in the oval office, incredibly nervous and trying to get words out to communicate what it is that I could bring to the picture that's new, that's different from those paintings that you see in the museums and that's different from all the contemporary art that you see today. I think I must have said something right, because I got the gig. But ultimately what I tried to communicate was that I will be looking not only at the presidency or the history of received power or the evolution of power as a form, but rather I would be looking at him as a man, his physical presence in the world. The first thing I did when I found out that I was chosen was go online and look at the millions of images of Michelle and the kind of person that she presented to the world. And then I wanted to capture something really private. It's about capturing that moment when they're giving you something different or where they're a little more relaxed and that can happen in a split second. Amy Sherald did not become a household name until she painted the portrait of the first lady, Michelle Obama Tell us how game changing this moment is. I am relieved that I can pay back my school loans. Becoming an artist is not empirical, so it's not about hard work. You have to put the work in, but that doesn't mean you're going to make it. And then the breakthrough comes and you're like, "Yeah, that's who I am. This is who I am." With that commission, Amy literally inspired by the person, Michelle Obama, creates this image, which is not only deeply Michelle Obama. Her whole gesture, the beautiful fashion. She created such an incredible image of a powerful, beautiful black woman. It's become an international symbol, and that shows the power of an image. Here's part of what the former first lady, Michelle Obama said at the unveiling at the unveiling of her portrait. Take a listen. I'm also thinking about all of the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution. For me, little Parker Curry, being captivated by that image of Michelle and seeing her own greatness in it and being able to go into a space and realize that there were people that existed before her whose legacies were so great that they'd been archived in this institution and it was a woman... For her to walk away with that sense of being is really important. I see myself as an American realist, which maybe some people would disagree with. My artistic process, the emphasis of it is really my life. I think the most interesting work that is being made has an autobiographical aspect to it. It's really been about writing a visual diary of me trying to figure out who I am as a person, as an individual. I consider the people in my paintings archetypes. They represent something that's bigger than who they are as an individual. It's important for me that they are just black people being black. There's something which people have written about in an Amy Sherald's paintings, which is the gaze. Her figures are often faced with a very strong fixed gaze at the viewer and people have written a lot about and she's talked about what that means and what's happening there. She's depicting or representing in some way the gaze that the white dominant culture has on black bodies. That sense of always being looked at through the eyes of someone else, that sense of a doubleness of identity, your African self, your American self. And so I think painters are very interested in representing that gaze. The eyes tell you what's in the soul and for me, the people that I paint, they're no longer themselves in the painting. They are these archetypes that know they are present. These aren't passive portraits, they're maybe confrontational. But it's definitely a response to a lot of images I saw growing up where our gaze was always averted or thinking about the fact that you couldn't look at a white person in the eye. So this is my way of nodding my head to that narrative and empowering the image in a way. I liked the paintings hung a little lower for that reason so when the viewer walks up, it's a different conversation. You're not looking up at it. It's almost looking directly at you and I think that creates a different kind of sensation. She gives us this image of a person. And what's interesting is that almost always, they're not painted in their actual skin tone. They may be kind of charcoal or bluish. So already she's alerted you to the fact that, I'm painting what appears to be something that's super real but in fact I'm giving you clues that this is just an exterior that has been constructed and that in fact, behind this exterior, there is also this world. So she puts the exterior interior into a real tension on her paintings. I can just stand in front of one of her paintings for hours. I think a lot of galleries are now picking up black artists because there is this gold rush. I say that it's because we're making some of the best work and the most relevant work. I think there's absolutely kind of something happening right now, but I always really want to not kind of make this moment seem so singular and special because I think there have always been black artists, there have always been black curators, black collectors. They just perhaps have not been part of the mainstream. Art and music are brothers and sisters. I got into collecting by accident. Collect what you feel, collect what you love. The Dean Collection is promoting living artists. African-Americans, we have to tell our own story. The work is amazing. I'm definitely not just a collector. I love being a disrupter. I love activism. Coming from the Bronx and coming into money very early I got the bug and then what I did was I started going around to local galleries. Most of the galleries used to not take me serious. Baggy pants, braids, but I didn't let that deter me. I admire Swizz Beats and Alicia because Swizz has allowed himself to be positioned as an African American collector of African-American art. And he and Alicia are about the culture. Swizz and Puff Daddy and Jay-Z and Beyonce are collecting now. It really elevates the game and there are a lot of people who look at what they're doing and what is important to them. Over the last few years, Swizz has built a collection of Gordon Parks photographs that is unequaled in private hands. In fact it is the largest collection of Gordon Parks photographs. All we want to do is preserve a piece of Gordon's legacy for the next generation to have access to it. The Dean Collection started out as this imaginary museum for my kids. And then what happened was I started posting artists on my Instagram that people weren't familiar with and then I started getting people writing me back saying: "Man, I appreciate you. Thank you." For what? Your work is great. "My show sold out. Galleries that wouldn't talk to me are calling me now." Then I started understanding the importance of promoting living artists. They used to laugh at me for collecting art. I've been having fun with this for 20 years. The Kaws piece and the Kehinde piece were the two pieces that started the Dean collection. Nobody ever thought that this sculpture would be in a house. This is the first time a sculpture like this is under a roof. This is from the Laying Down series. The fact that a human's hand did this... It looked like he just did it yesterday. I can't show this piece enough. We put the Dean Collection museum on our property so the public can see the collection. This is Hank Willis' ball and we have artists of all colors from all around the world. When someone buys your work, it's not ever really about the money for an artist. It's about the vote of confidence. It's really someone saying: "Keep doing what you're doing." "I'm making space for you to make new things." And what's exciting about Karen Jenkins-Johnson, Swizz Beats, Bernard Lumpkin and many amazing African American collectors that I've gotten to engage with over the years is that they have a joy, a verve and enthusiasm for the work. That really is affirming. That really gives you confidence. I think it's absolutely necessary that black people with money buy African American art. It's important when they see Beyonce and Jay-Z in the Louvre. It's important when they know that P Diddy has acquired a Kerry James Marshall. They see the people that they celebrate and admire doing that and hopefully that is imprinting art is to be collected, it is to be lived with, it's part of a quality of life. The collectors, the patrons and supporters of really good art really have to have a kind of a vision and have to have a kind of a mindset that says: "I want to engage with something that may not be universally appreciated" "or loved but I see power in, that I see potential in." I'm always grateful that people collect my work. But I'm also grateful when people give museums, institutions funds to bring that work into public collections, because that's the way that I, as a young artist, got to see the work, not in people's houses, but in museums. I think it's super important that black collectors or any collectors think about public institutions. I go into an institution and just absorb that place. And for me, it's about looking at everything and talking to everybody. I look at their collections as much as I can and I talk to everybody from the maintenance to the chairman of the board. It's often not what anyone says specifically in conversations, it's what they don't say that give me some ideas about what's going on in the museum, that creates the image that the public sees. I'm just using the museum as my pallet basically. I usually have a notebook and I just write down things during the period of research. It's things that I see that I want to see again, objects, images and from that I build the exhibition. What you see on view is one thing, but what people have in storage can be entirely different. It brings up questions, the public only sees what is created for them. And those kinds of incongruities are all smoothed out. And I'm seeing what's not being discussed that may not be of interest to the curator or part of their scholarship. It's the underbelly, but it's not what they're putting out to the public. Museums now understand that they need to tell a counter narrative about American life and about black art. They need to correct what stories haven't been told through their collecting practices, through the displays, through the exhibitions that they've had. In 1994, I was 17 years old and I see Thelma Golden's Black Male exhibition and it was life-changing. Here for the first time you're seeing black masculinity, not as something on television that's menacing or at arm's length, but rather artists embracing it as the subject matter, another color on their palette. It was mind blowing. An exhibition that really tore down the meaning of the black body itself. Belmont asked me to participate in that show at the Whitney. It was all kinds of artists, of all races, all genders who were dealing with black masculinity as a subject matter. It was really, really engaged with notions of identity, but in a provocative way around gender and sexuality and race in this kind of surreal, melding and fusion. There had been all of this talk about a negative aspect of black lifestyle, especially amongst men. When an exhibition was put together which represented so much of what people did not know about the African-American male, it was a shock and yet it was a revelation because nothing like that had been presented in the museum before. To show the nuances, the beauty, the lure and loathing that comes with the black male body in particular was very important to put that into the larger conversation. The fears of otherness are so played out most often around this notion of black masculinity, that I think it's very important that in looking at it we understand much of what comes to be racism or even sexism, or even the homophobia that exists in this culture. I think what a lot of people don't remember or even folks in the art world is that back in the early '90s it was still very difficult to pull off a show with African-American content in a mainstream art museum. Mostly because the curators in that museum weren't interested or in the case of something like black male, it would engender controversy in a very mixed audience. That was an historical show. It's a show that now has been in hindsight considered highly historical despite the reactions at the time. There was a Lyle Ashton Harris picture in the tutu, which was incredibly disturbing at the time and alluring at once. It looked at the body as a sign of strength, it looked at masculinity as a sign of performance, it looked at femininity as an invention. And it really threw open this question of, how does choice become the central role of the artist? I think people were shocked by just maybe the boldness and the rawness of the works. It's speaking your truth. It's not so much trying to make the work stand out as opposed to trusting your process, your ideas and your inner guidance. I think in retrospect, people look back at Black Male and realize that Thelma was really on to something. And what came out of it was a really definitive work on the meaning of blackness and maleness in visual culture. In a survey of major American museums it was determined that 85% of artists in major American art museum collections are white. If you break down the number of artists of color in those collections, it's 1.2% black. If the person sitting at the table in a curatorial meeting, or the people sitting at that table are all white, you're going to have a problem, a problem of interpretation, in terms of trying to figure out what you're doing right or wrong. And most importantly, you're going to have a problem in terms of the work you're going to select. If all of the critics writing are white, the same problem exists. Until the institutions become more diverse and it's happening... You'll be getting to see young, brilliant curators of color assume pretty important roles in American museums. But until it happens in a widespread way, or until white critics and curators and journalists look into themselves, research the world around them and look into the past openly and honestly, until they change until they're open-minded, it's not going to change as fast as it needs to. I feel like it's important for us to own our own culture as African-Americans, because it's our culture and we hate the way other people tell our story. There's always flaws in it because they didn't live it. Most of the primary institutions, most of the cultural institutions have been behind. They've been behind in film, they've been behind in TV, they've been behind in popular culture generally, they've been behind in museums and sort of cultural institutions. They're simply behind. There are more exhibitions featuring African-American artists, black artists, whether they're African-American or not. There are more exhibitions featuring women. Those are exhibitions. They don't always translate into acquisitions. When I go around to museums and I see the work of black artists up, I do this little game where I look at the wall label and look at the acquisition dates. And when I look at those dates, I find in a lot of museums that they're very recent. So I think institutions do have a long way to go in terms of catching up. Now, I guarantee you they're selling off pieces to give some color in those museums to balance that scale. So it is only a matter of time that greatness will shine through. We love heroes. We love celebrities. We love the one. It is just part of our culture. It's our culture in music, it's our culture in visual arts, it's our political culture. We like superheroes. John Michel Basquiat emerges in the art world in the early 1980s. This was a moment where the art world was kind of hungry for something fresh, something exciting, something different, something youthful. He's also doing work that really kind of grabs that certain kind of notions of the street and the urban decline that we're all experiencing towards the end of the 20th century. I think he changed the conversation in a big way. He got a lot of publicity from being around the right people at that time. The meteoric rise of his career was unprecedented in terms of black visual artists. And this is also the moment when many of these younger artists, like Glenn Ligon, Lorna Simpson and Kara Walker are in art school. So by the time we get to the early 1990s when they explode, I think that Basquiat's legacy and the message he sends to the art world is something that they are the beneficiaries of. I remember distinctly going to the Whitney to see a Kara Walker exhibition. I was struck by several things. She has such an incredible mastery of that medium of the silhouettes and she has that attentiveness to her materials and representation and a sense of space and design and dramatic scenario. The cutouts I started doing partly as an antidote to painting. Painting was too readily recognized, too quick from the hand, too gestural, too personality laden perhaps. And I wanted to distance myself from the idea that this was me talking, but that it was kind of a masked character talking about masked characters. Kara Walker is a crucible for the field of African-American art. She's a crucible for the field of modernism. I have an enormous amount of respect for her willingness to go into the underbelly of the Neo-Confederate narrative in American culture and bring it to our attention through forms that disturb, that command and that reshape our understanding about black life and white Americans in this country. Love the work, hate the work, you have to reckon with the work. If you don't, you're not reckoning with the history of this country. I think what people push against is a sense of irreverence about the moment or time and space where Africans were enslaved. I think they push against what they see is the perversity, sexual perversity, degradation of black bodies or complicitness in that perversity that she brings to bear. To pull on that history and to play upon that history is something that she does much to the chagrin of the black community. I'm not trying to drop a bomb on the public necessarily. But sometimes I think the work does have that impact. My approach initially was decidedly tongue in cheek. Your reality, my reality, my fantasy, my fear, my humanity, my clownishness, all of that has to kind of come to bear. There's all these narrative tropes stereotypes mythologies that we live with, some are very overt, some are parading around in broad daylight, some are unconscious fantasies, fears, wishes, loathings, anxieties. In 2013, I was approached to do a public art project in the Domino Sugar factory, this old derelict plant on the waterfront. It was a good collaboration and the best kind of collaboration is the kind where an organization says, "We really want to support what artists do. What do you want to do?" And you say: "I want to build a 40 foot sphinx made out of sugar." The scale was determined by the space. The Sphinx became a kind of monumental marker. It was such a new way of working and collaborating, and working with the team and working three-dimensionally. I'm always interested in the challenge of working in sort of public space and the challenge being new audiences for the work. I wanted to create a compelling space to enter. I got a longer historical lens to view sugar production that enslaved African people who were commodified and then segregated, excluded, oppressed, destroyed. It brings a lot of feeling forward. I think that my approach in making art doesn't involve or doesn't actually know what the rules are of what can and can't be said. She hasn't paid her dues. She doesn't know her history. She's sailing us downriver. I mean, those are phrase I heard. She must hate black people as much as she hates herself. The experience of white America and black America is very different because white America very often will find it incredibly entertaining and black America will look at it and almost cringe at the pain that's being depicted and that's in and of itself very telling. I think there is something about the black community that feels we have ownership of these stories because they come out of us, they come through us, they are about us. But again, we're not a monolith either. And for moments where there were enslaved Africans, there were also free Africans. We're a composite of many different histories coming together, so to say that this is a monolithic reaction to artwork, I think is at best skewed. And then to say that that relationship of how people react should only be cast in white, which is not a monolith and black, which is not a monolith, is also a bit skewed. There are those who feel that Kara represents certain aspects of our history that is being negatively portrayed in her art. Be that as it may, you can't say to an artist: "You have the freedom to do whatever you want to." "However, you can't do such and such a thing. I won't let you do this." Either you have the freedom to do it or you don't. She put herself out there or her work was put out there when she was very young. It was very hard to digest. Everybody attacked her and then some people totally embraced her. It must've been very confusing, but she stayed with her program and she's still on her program. And to me, that's a huge inspiration. It's not always about being appreciated and liked. Sometimes it's about being reviled and criticized, but it's that activity that makes the art important. I think she's shown extreme courage and strength in doing her work. So to me, that's inspirational. When I came to New York in the '60s, I was very young, I was as moving between San Francisco and New York and I discovered the Studio Museum fairly early. Everything happened there. It was a focal point for anybody that was interested in culture. And so I became instantly a part of that group and wanted to be a part of that group of intellectuals and artists asking questions about the moment in which we lived. Shortly after leaving Yale, I was accepted to become the Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem, which came as a great shock to me principally because it's one of the most desired Artists-in-Residences in the world. There's a stamp of approval that comes from having the Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum. For black art to thrive it's always required spaces, fellowship, community. The Studio Museum has provided that when really no other institution did. Knowing all the people who would come through the Studio Museum in Harlem program, being a part of that space that is magic and knowing what that magic was, was something I wanted to be a part of. I knew that that was a moment of real potential change in my life. This is a painting that I am working on currently. I spend time looking at the image and really trying to parse out from it an emotion or a sense of feeling that I think is going to be the aura of the painting as a whole. I'm pulling colors that I think are most vibrant or most important that I want to make sure that I include in the painting. As it comes to life, I get really excited. I always start with their faces and their eyes. It's an opportunity to really connect with them and then I can make everything else happen once I've done that. What can I say about Jordan? She's amazing. She is working in the tradition of African-American portraiture in a realist tradition, but she's bringing to it her own unique perspective as a woman. And I think as a young person also, depicting young people today in their everyday realities and in their everyday lives. I made the decision to explicitly represent black men and boys in an effort to push against the narratives that I felt were kind of dominating the public sphere at that time. And my initial decision in representing them nude was featuring black men centered in their homes, trying to capture them in their most vulnerable and intimate spaces. I wanted to treat the black body with as much care and attention as possible. When I started to decide that I wanted to make these paintings, the scale was really important. I wanted them to feel like they could step out of the canvas and be participants in our day-to-day lives I also wanted them to feel like they were pushing against the confines of the canvas itself. When I was a resident at the Studio Museum in Harlem, I had the opportunity to have a studio visit with Thelma. And she came into my studio and she said that my work reminded her of landscape painting. And I remember thinking that that felt very farfetched and distant from what it was that I was identifying around this work. "I am a portrait painter". That's how I was recognizing myself. And the fact that she said landscape really resonated over time, specifically thinking about the landscape in the full breadth of the environment that we occupy and the spaces that we move throughout. I look at my body of work and I see a scrapbook of my life that there are various moments in time where I have been somewhere and met someone and then they have been invited to participate in my practice. Being at the Studio Museum in Harlem brought me home. All the resources within that institution would be at my finger tips and the prospect of that I knew was immense. There's an oasis for you there and a place to always go back to. There's a real community of people who care about me still and are invested in me. And that investment can take you beyond anything you ever imagined when other people believe in you from the beginning. The Studio Museum has created this extraordinary program called the Artist-in-Residence program. It gives artists studio space, time, a community, and an exhibition of their work at the end, mentorship along the way. From that we have some of our, what you might call art stars today. I was an Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum in 1985. You can understand from experience the value of places like that for creating what people understand to be community. It's the place where you can go and if you want to meet people who are in the art world, you can only meet them at the Studio Museum. That matters. It matters that there's a place you can go and do that. And it mattered that there was a place that was run by black folks, that was owned by black folks, in which a whole lot of people who came through were all black folks. That mattered too. It mattered. The Studio Museum had always been a beacon. It was one of the places that appreciated and showcased our work at a very, very early point in the conversation. And I was very honored to be invited to New York City as a Studio Museum in Harlem resident. That's how I moved to New York City. The people who funded the arts and who supported the arts, some of them thought that what we were doing was laughable. "Why do you need a black fine arts museum?" You have MoMA, you have Met, you have the Guggenheim. Why do you even need a museum? The fact that people were asking that question was a clear evidence that we really did need that museum. I'm still with the Studio Museum. The Studio Museum is still the focal point of African-American cultural production and artistic production in the country if not on the planet. It is one of the most important institutions that we have and what Thelma is doing there, what she's done there, the way she's led the organization into the 21st century is absolutely extraordinary and really important. I don't see the Studio Museum as the only place for funneling black talent into the mainstream if there's such a thing as the mainstream. I think it's one of the major places. I think black colleges and universities still play an important role in that kind of definition of who one becomes as an artist. Without the work of historically black colleges and universities we wouldn't have a repository of African-American art. The HBCUs have not been given the credit that they're due. When nobody else was out there championing these artists, HBCUs were there, claiming them, showcasing them, putting them up on the wall, teaching about them. When we think of Clark Atlanta, when we think of Spelman, when we think of Fisk University, when we think of Howard, these are all spaces in which black artists and black art has flourished for hundreds of years. They were the patrons of African-American artists. That's why these institutions now have some of the most important works by those kinds of important historical figures. I think one of the most exciting things about the progression of contemporary African-American art and the artists that are working today inheriting that tradition is that they've said: "You know what? My artistic forebears have paved the way for me" "to make work of a whole different range of topics" "in a whole different kind of way." Being a clay guy isn't about a tea bowl or a teapot. It's about having a sense that a thing that is under-fashioned, lesser understood, unbuilt, dirt, that with skill and a knowledge of form one could then take this stuff and turn it into something useful. And that the only limitation between dirt becoming a useful form or just dirt is ability. This idea that we could be active participants in the reshaping of nothingness is super important to me. The actors, the makers of the '60s and '70s were all too aware of the truth of the complexity of nothingness. When I was an undergrad studying ceramics, I was studying all the greats. There were all these amazing makers. None of them looked like me. I read and read and found the story of Dave Drake. I just thought: "Finally an individual in the history of American making" "that I could root myself in." And so I remember trying to embody Dave. Dave Drake was one of the most proficient potters in the United States at the time in which he was making his work. And he was subversive with his practice. He would inscribe, at a time when it was illegal for a slave to know how to read, messages on these pots to declare his own mastery. And he was a master, an artistic master. David Drake was in Two Centuries of Black American Art. It also reminds us is that the arts were a way to exert power even in a moment of slavery. This is an artist who even defied what the term master meant. He was a master at his craft. Introducing Dave's story would mean there was a name that people didn't know from the past and that by bringing him up, maybe it wouldn't mean anything to anyone, but I at least had a black potter that I could identify with. It was the beginning of a kind of hopefulness within blackness that I could be myself in this craft and know that there was some part of it that had a legacy. When I was only making pots, when I was just working in clay, I reached a point in the material where there were other things I wanted to say, and they couldn't be done through the material. So I graduated, if you will, into using whatever. I went from being a potter to being a conceptualist. It didn't matter what the material was. I was open, but I needed the right material to tell the right story. Here's one of the earliest civil rights tapestries. It's basically fire hoses that had been discontinued, sewn together and framed. And this body of work grew out of me starting to have a conversation about the history of protests and the use of the fire hose in places like Selma and Birmingham. Then there were moments where the material world couldn't say certain things for me. Then I was back to the first route, which was the immaterial form, the spiritual form. And that's when voice became super important, speech acts, choirs, music. Sound had its own material form. Its own ability to transform space. Its own ability to resurrect the soul. There was something that I didn't want to leave behind in the story of my people, that I felt music could do in a way that some of these objects couldn't. He sings and to a certain extent he preaches. He has that whole vernacular of understanding the definition of what black culture is about. Here's an artist who studied ceramics, but also studied urban planning. So he's utilizing his artwork to really expand modes of how one produces, how art could spearhead economic vitalization. Theaster Gates is one of the beacons of this kind of change. He's done this through the Rebuild Foundation with his actual spaces. He's done this through the creation of the Black Artists Retreat. He's done it through his own practice, his own art making practice, and he's done it through the fellowship that he offers to other artists. Going to a Black Artists Retreat in Chicago was the first time I was ever able to meet my contemporaries because I didn't live in New York, so I wasn't going to openings. It was a magnificent experience. I think we all left there changed and invigorated and we all support each other. You can get people involved in art on many, many levels. Knowing that art plays a significant role in the wholeness of life, not just one aspect of it. You don't have to go to the museum to see it. You can be part of it in your own community. He has really revolutionized the whole concept of art more than any other artist I know. -Are you an artist? -Yes. I'm the artist who made these pictures. You can see of course that I was greatly influenced by Romare Bearden, enamored by his work. I wanted to integrate the painting and make the painting primary. I devoted my life to teaching through collecting, through curating. I saw the need to participate in the cultural awareness, helping to revise and redefine American art. In my opinion, David Driskell's presence in the art world is a significance of him sending the elevator back down. He was a trailblazer for all of us. When there were no black voices in the art world for him to assert himself in the way that he did helped move us forward during a time where we were still fighting for space in museums and in galleries. Traditionally there was a moment when there were not many images or representations of African-Americans in paintings, in the visual arts, in our collective visual culture. And now, thanks to Two Centuries of Black Art, the world was given these amazing portrayals and images about black culture and they became seared in the collective imagination. And I think we are part of a continued renaissance. It's been happening. What I'm most excited about is, do we have the capacity to be great makers in the absence of light. If blackness has something to do with the absence of light, does black art mean that sometimes I'm making when no one's looking? And for the most part that has been the truth of our lives. Is there a light? Yes. But until we own the light, I'm not happy. Until we're in our own houses of exhibition, of discovery, of research, until we figure out a way to be masters of the world, then I'd rather work in darkness. I'd rather work in darkness because at least I know that I'm working. That I don't want to work only when the light comes on. My fear is that we're being trained and conditioned to only make if there's a light and that makes us codependent upon a thing that we don't control. Are you willing to make in the absence of light? There has been an awakening, an awareness, but that's enlightenment through education, through desire to want, to know, to improve. And I think a lot of that's going on. On the other hand, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we haven't reached the promised land. We've got a long way to go. This film is dedicated to the memory of David Driskell and Maurice Berger.
