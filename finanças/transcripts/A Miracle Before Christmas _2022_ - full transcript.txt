- Okay, smile. - Look this way. Good mornin', beautiful. Good morning. How about last night? Wow, amazing. Yes, it was. What are you doing? Turning last night into a morning ritual. Mm-mm. No. Mm-mm. - No? - No. No, no, no, no. Save some for later. Early bird gets the worm. Yeah, I know. Heard it a million times. I'ma just try to go back to sleep. Kiss the kids for me. You know, you could stick around yourself and do it. Time waits for no one, honey. Don't forget, Ashley has her piano recital at 1:30. It'll break her heart if you're not there. Okay, I'll be there. Just make sure she wears the red and white dress I laid out for her so at least this time she's matching. Yeah. You do know she picked that out herself, right? Exactly. Take a big breath in. Leave our bodies. And bring that foot to the inner thigh. Waiting for a moment of awesome balance the full expression of this pose. Fabulous. I want it! Keith, you're my financial advisor. You know what I like. Okay. Why not? Okay, well, get it done. Okay, bye. Do you want me to stop at your usual spot? You know it! - Are you nervous? - Kind of. Mom's coming, right? I wont be nervous if she's there. Yeah, she wouldn't miss it for the world, okay? Jordan, you have one minute! Do you think Mom will finally let us have a dog this Christmas? I wouldn't count on it. Daddy, he took my bacon again! Shh! Well, look who decided to join us. Well, Dad, you know I have to look fresh for the ladies. Oh boy, sit down! Shut up, bubblehead! In your dreams, bacon head. Well, if I'm a bacon face whatever you say, then what does that make you? Y'all finish eating, okay? In your dreams, troll. Oh, I forgot to tell you. And Anne and I are getting back together. Guys, hurry up! The bus is waiting. Come on! Jordan. Don't forget your sister! Come on, let's go! I'm coming, I'm coming. We gotta go, the... - The bus about to leave! - Come on, come on! Be careful and I love you guys, okay? Love you too, Dad! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on! Come on, let's go! You got everything? See ya at the recital. Bye! - All right. - Love you! Me and Mom will be there. Don't forget, she's picking you up from school today! Yeah, all right. Pick you up later tonight? Matt's picking me up. Toss this, please? Sure thing. See you tomorrow! It's about time. Hey, Mercedes, I just... Shh! Proceed. I've been trying to reach you. Your phone must still be on silent. No, I got all 12 calls. I just was hoping you got the message. And what message is that? Oh my god, you can't be serious. I'm playing, but we have a slight problem you may be able to help me with. If I need to fix your problems, then what do I need with you? Let me know when it's done. Okay! Sandra and Terry... Y'all ready to get started? Okay, so... how's that date life going? We don't date. We're married. Oh! Is that what happens? When you get married, you stop dating? No, no, no, it's the complete opposite. Your time together is very important. Yeah, we... We definitely don't date. Oh. With the kids, we can't make time for that. And they're growing up so fast. Terry needs all the hours he can get at the plant. And for the past year, they've been keeping him there for weeks at a time. And you know it's a very remote place to cell phones? They don't work so good. Bad reception. Very, very remote. Mm-hmm. Uh, it's real busy. Are you guys being upfront with each other about your relationship? - Absolutely! - Yes. Sure about that? Okay. Well, let's do a quick exercise. Turn to each other. And I want you to repeat after me. From this day forward... "From this day forward..." Say, I promise... "I promise..." To give you... "To give you..." Twenty minutes... Wha... Two zero. "Twenty minutes..." Of my undivided... Okay, see, now... Ah, ah, ah. I said undivided. "Undivided attention..." Each day. "Each day." Now, Mr. Terry, I'm gon' need you to have a conversation with your boss, and tell them that you're gonna need to spend a lot more time at home. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think that'll be quite all right. Now, what I do want to talk to you guys about is your communication... I think we've lost the romance. I think that that's what I'm looking at. I think I'm looking at two people who were once in love, who, I mean, couldn't go a day without calling each other, coming to visit, and just having wild and crazy sex. And here we are, where husband's off having remote who knows what, wife's feeling overwhelmed, things aren't going right, the kids are running you crazy. I can feel it, I can see it, sis. Well, we gotta fix that! We can do the thing? Girl, I'ma feel you... The thing? Thank you so much. Thank you, guys! All right, have a great rest of the day. Yeah, you too. Y'all keep going, keep going, yes! We gonna keep going. Okay, all right! Okay, now! Yes! Mercedes, you are so good! Mm! Too good. Oh, sorry for interrupting. Your 4:00 PM, the Fontaines, wanted to thank you, but instead have decided to renew their vows at some country club... tonight. Oh. This is the second cancellation. What are you telling these people? Only how to be their best selves. We can't keep them forever. Oh, make sure to charge them for their last 12 sessions. That's good and all, but since you've got me working so much, I assume we can't afford any extra help around here? I mean, shouldn't we try to keep as much business as we can, at least until things pick up? If we keep losing everyone at the pace that we are, we will be out of business by New Year. Oh my god, so dramatic! How's Ronald? You mean Calvin. Whatever his name is. I'm sure he's, uh, pretty excited about all that extra money you're making. He's happy I can finally help pay for things, yes. Exactly! See? Our business is fine! All right, we had a few slow months, but alas, Christmas is only days away, and dysfunction saves the day. How long have you been with me? Seven years. And have I ever let you down? Well, there was that one New Year's party a few years back. Get out. Girl, I'm playing. Oh, I'm almost forgot! Matthew called for the fourth time today. He has to make sure you're on time for dinner tonight. Why didn't he just call me? Because you don't answer your phone. Whatever. Oh, gosh, before I forget, put these in the mail for me. I'm adopting elderly this year. Mm, look who's in the Christmas spirit. I surprise myself. Girl, this plant is dead. That's also a surprise. Water it. Oh, oh my god. Your financial advisor wants to do a 1:00 PM meeting to discuss the portfolio you've been asking about. I can't. I have a 1:30 thing with my daughter. He said that's his only opening and he has a late flight. Gosh, come on. Well... Matthew will be there. She'll be fine. As he always is. Well. Oh, make sure to call and tell him that he has to pick up the kids from school because I'm sure this is going to run over. Okay. I will, uh, let him know. And, uh, I have to leave early on Christmas Eve. We have a few friends dropping by for a... holiday party. I'll manage. We wanna add that on to this... We gotta make that happen. Let's do it! ♪ Jesus Lord at thy birth Good luck, Ashley. Okay, then. Hey Ashley, it's time. She's not coming, is she? Honey, they're waiting. We gotta go, but you got this. I told you so. You got this. So, as you can see, your account has been doing very well. Yeah, this is what you have right now in your bank account right here. - Here? - Yes. So, that's a reason to be happy. And it's gonna get even bigger. It has to be bigger! So what we're trying to do right now, because the stock market is always fluctuating... So please, do tell me more about this new project. You know what? Okay, I'll have to say this... I'm super excited about it, but we haven't exactly nailed down anything yet. Okay. Her relationship to work, that she's gotta stop And do you know what this girl told me? I mean, woman told me? She kept on cutting me off, telling me that I was wrong. And I'm like, see, this is the problem. Now you're trying to boss me around. You can't boss me around. Babe, I thought we weren't having business talk tonight. Oh. Matthew, I kind of want to hear the rest of this story. Please? By the end of the session, sis was putty in my hands, okay? We had a breakthrough, and then by the time they walked out of my office, they were like two newlyweds on the second night of their honeymoon. Voila. I told her that Mercedes Wright is the baddest bitch that she will ever sit in front of! - Period. - Okay. Matt, did you share your great news? Ah, not yet. Ain't no secrets at this table. It's not really that big of a deal. Plus I'm not trying to talk about work right now. I'll be damned! What? Bruh, this man here just became the head of the biggest project - in the history of our company. - What? And you don't wanna share that news at the table? - Babe! - All right. It's kinda cool, okay? Baby! What? Just don't forget about us little folks, all right? Mm, no, Caleb, uh-uh, no. Your time is gonna come. And we have a two-year-old, so, uh, no, I need you home as much as possible. True. Congratulations. Thank you. Let's cheers to my brother, his big endeavor, proud of you. Salut! If you ask me, it's overdue. If I was him, I'd walk right into that company and, look, if you can't make me partner, I'm out. Partner? That's a bit of a reach, don't you think? She had too many drinks. I don't think it's reaching. I mean, why just continue to make other people rich instead of building your own company? There wouldn't be a Mercedes Wright had I just sat around and waited. My girl. She's saying it right. That right? - Ha! - Hello. To that! It wasn't that bad. Wow, you serious? You know, I just wish you could see yourself sometimes. We had guests over for three hours. Nobody was able to say anything. That's ridiculous! Everyone talked. Okay. So what did Faith and Caleb talk about? It's not my fault no one had anything interesting to say. You know, I was hoping that tonight would help us reconnect, especially after you stood up your own daughter on her biggest day. I'm done defending you to them. Well, excuse me! Okay, look. I think you're being a little dramatic about this. Look, I got tipsy. I'm sorry. But you're not exactly Mr. Perfect. What are you talking about? This isn't about that. When was the last time you thought about something more important than yourself? Okay, stop it. You and the kids are very important. Oh, really? So how about you explain to them why you never show up to anything? Okay, wait a minute, now, that's not fair. I never ask you to choose. All right, what's wrong with me being a passionate career woman? And what's wrong with me encouraging my husband to become partner in a company, and which he rightfully deserves? First off, they don't offer partnerships, okay? Secondly, I love my job. I love being an architect. But I love our family a lot more. I have no interest in chasing something that's going to take me away from that. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, humor me. Why do you have a driver when you have a Mercedes out front? Because I... Don't do that. I miss the woman that I married. Mercedes Johnson. Did you know that Ashley lost another tooth? You didn't tell me that. Yes, I did. A week ago. Even told your parents. You don't talk to them anymore. I just think we need some space, some time so that you can have some clarity and figure out what's important to you. So you're really leaving? You're your biggest fan. You get you all to yourself. I'll be at my mom's with the kids. Matthew! I think there's a major difference in the way you guys walked in here and the way you guys are about to walk out of here. We made some progress today, guys. And I'm proud of us! Go make some babies! What are we doing? We're wasting time here. That's what I'm talking about! Now we're all on the same page! I'll see you guys next week. Okay, see you next week. All right! See you soon. Ah, yes! Ooh, baby, call me Mrs. Fix It! You are so good, girl! Yes, I know, I know, you are so good. Woo-hoo! Hi, Mercedes. Well, he took the kids to do and to see the Christmas decorations downtown. That's not like him to just leave his phone. To be honest with you, Mercedes, he knew you'd call, You can always come see the kids whenever you want, Mercedes. While you figure out what you want. I'll tell him you called. Mm, well... Okay, I'll figure it out myself. I need a drink. Cancel your Christmas Eve plans. I need you to organize my financial statements for the past seven years. But I told you about my Christmas party. Go late. I need them done by Christmas. "A woodsman, who was chopping logs nearby, "He grabbed that old wolf and made him spit out "that poor grandmother, "who was a bit frazzled, if I must say so, "by the whole experience, "but still in one piece. "'Oh, Grandma, I was scared!' sobbed Little Red Hiding Hood. "'I'll never speak to strangers or dawdle in the forest again.' "That woodsman knocked out that wolf "and carried him deep into the forest, "where he wouldn't bother people or Little Red Riding Hood ever again. The end." All right, kids, lights out. Can we say our prayers? Yeah, can we? Of course. Yes, Lord. God, thank you for today, my family, and your love in our lives. Thank you for Grandma and the greatest daddy in the world, and Mommy, the greatest mommy in the world. She doesn't know yet, but she is. God, please have your angels watch over her and change her, and we can be a happy family again. Amen. All right, it's time for bed. Light's out for real this time, okay? - Another shot? - Mm-hmm. Rough night, huh? Thanks, Gary. You have no idea. If I had a dime for every person I see like this during the season... Mm-hmm. On the house. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ah, sorry. I didn't see you there. Yeah. The same thing brought us both here. I'm sure your problems are nothing compared to mine. What I've learned in life is there's no problem so original that there's not an answer to it. Hm, no advice I can take from you. Okay. Imagine having an ungrateful spouse. I gave that man the world. And one hiccup, and that world is over. Let them sleep, baby. They'll be fine. You'll all be fine. Hey. God works in mysterious ways. I'm sorry. I'm probably talking your ear off. I didn't even get your name. - Oh, I'm David. - Mercedes. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. So, um... You find you have no fault in any of this? Honestly? No. Yes. Look, I'm ambitious. And so is he! And maybe I talk too much sometimes, but that's what I do. I fix relationships. I am Mercedes Wright. The chick from the projects who watched her parents struggle to get me through college. There is no way I'm letting us go back to that nightmare. Would he? I knew you wouldn't get it. Well, seems to me you have it all figured out. I do! I just wish he could see how lucky he is and how many men would die to be in his position. Is that what you wish? Excuse me? Is that your wish? For him to see how empty his life would be without you? I never thought about it that way. Huh, if only that was possible. Is that your wish? I could make it... as if you two hadn't ever met. I must be drunk out my mind. I sit here two hours talking to some nutcase talkin' about how he gonna grant me a wish? Humor me. Yeah. I want him to see what life is like without Mercedes Wright. Your wish is granted. Okay. Well, this party is lame, so, I'm gonna go home. I've had a little too much to drink. So have you. You get home safe, David. Miss Perfect is going home. See you soon! Mercedes Wright... Ha, ha! I thought you were at your parents' house. I think maybe you got the wrong house? Matthew, I've had a long day, okay? Move, I'm not in the mood. - Miss, Miss, excuse me! - Whoa! - Excuse me, please! - What? Matt, who's at the door? I think somebody's lost. Lost? Hi, the Michaels are a few doors down. I know the GPS can be confusing. Matthew, who is this chick and why is she in the house that I pay half for? And stop saying I'm at the wrong address 'cause I'm not. What is she talking about? What am I... And how does she know your name? Babe, I have no idea. I'ma ask you to leave or I'm calling the cops. - Get the hell out of my house. - I don't know her! Are you serious? Miss, please! When I feel a tap on my shoulder, And he says, "Do you have some time?" So, we walk across the street, and I think he's taking me for lunch. - And he says, "No, no." - No, no? Real stern like, "My car." - Wow! - Girl! He's gonna look at me and ask, "How much do you want?" I say, "You ain't gotta pay me nothin' because I ain't no h... " He then slams his cuffs on me. I'm screaming! Help! Help! He's gonna tell me to shut up. What? I froze and looked him straight in the eye and kicked him in the you know what. That's right. Mercedes Johnson? You're free to go. Feel better than me, girl. Oh, thank god. Me too? Please? Uh, excuse me? There are more people in here too! What about me? I just want you to know that you will be hearing from my attorney, okay? How dare you lock me up in this disgusting place! Do you know who I am? Look, lady, take it up with the judge. Can I get my phone call? Look, where's Matthew? Who? Matthew, my husband? There's no Matthew. And he didn't mention that he was your husband. Hello again! I told you I'd be seeing you soon. Where's my husband? After all you've been through tonight, haven't you figured it out yet? Figured out what? Your wish. There is no husband, no family. No one to be responsible for or accountable to. You're free! Now you can both experience what life would be like if... you'd never met. Okay. You are really insane. Could you... okay, first of all, please stop stalking me, okay? This is what you get for being nice to weirdos. Second... must've left my wallet at the office, but... listen. I will come to the bar tomorrow and give you cash, okay? To pay you back. - Are we good? - Oh, very good. Good. Hey. Are you sure we're in the right place? Let me check. Just stay put. What? We're sorry, you have reached a number We're sorry, you have reached a number What can I get ya? Um, I was in here a few hours ago. Um, but it looks like you've changed everything up. I might've had a little too much to drink, but I was wondering if anyone handed in a wallet and a ring? Don't ask. No. Okay. Gary, I was just sitting right here. Lady, I don't remember you. It was only a few of us in here. What do you want? A beer. Shoot. Can I at least have a glass? God! ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ With goodies in my sleigh ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ Against the special scene ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ I'll take you on a magic ride in my sleigh tonight ♪ ♪ You're gonna look for me ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ With goodies in my sleigh ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ Against the special scene ♪ I'm the bad Santa Claus ♪ Whoa, whoa, yeah Thanks. I guess they're trying to mix it up a bit. Never knew they had dancers. And I come here often. That's a drag. I've never seen you before. And I'm very good with faces. I do remember you as that stuck-up executive bitch that was in the can earlier. I'm sorry? Sorry. People talk, but I've never seen you here before. You know, I'm not a big fan of what they did around here. You could tell it was a rush job. What brings you here tonight? This is obviously not your type of hangout. I'm looking for my ring and my wallet. I thought I might've left it here when I was... here, earlier. Hey, what's going on with Gary? He's never this rude. That prick is never nice. The less talking he does, the better. It's obvious he hates his job. If you ask me, he's in the wrong line of business. Well, good luck. I'll let the gang know to keep a lookout if they find something. Yeah, bet you will. Well, screw you! I'm only offering to help. Believe it or not, the people in here are more trustworthy than you upscale pricks. Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry! Look, I... It's been a long day, all right? I'm sorry. What are you having? I'm tapped out with this. I spent my last on it. It's Christmas, babe. It's on the house. Gary, another round for the lady. Thanks. Look, I need you to pay your tab tonight! Oh, shut up, Gary. Have a heart! She lost her wallet. I always pay my freakin' tab. Such a jerk, I tell you. Well, I need some air and a cigarette. - You comin'? - When did he get like this? Oh, just forget him. He's always like this. Candy. I need you to close out your tab tonight. It ain't free, you know. Relax, Gary! Jeez! Ugh! Jerk! Anyway... Right. What part of town you live? Well, I thought I knew, and then I ended up in jail. Girl, your issue is more serious than I thought! You must be drinking that new stuff they got here. Got people blackin' out for days at a time, ugh. Well... I want you to be safe. You're welcome to crash at my place and stay the night. I'm sure you'll be fine tomorrow. Thanks. Looks like your world isn't ending after all. Hello? Mercedes, where are you? I've been waiting here for the past hour for you. Uh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine. Long day. I miss you. Very funny. It's Kenny. East Hills, at your place? Right. Where are you? Where? Why are you at that low-class place? I'm sending a car to come get you. East Hills? That's the richest part of town. Why are you way over here? Anyway... call me. So I can know you got home safe. Thank you. Good morning, beautiful. You should just stay. I wish I could, but... busy day today. I am done with alcohol. I had the worst nightmare last night. You weren't even you. Even Marlon's wasn't even the same. Anyway, some woman claimed to live here with you. She better be lucky it was a dream. Uh-huh. Just come back to bed. Early bird gets the worm. It's okay, you can leave early for work. I'm gonna stay home with the kids. Kids? That'll be the day! You must be dreaming. Oh my god! It was real. Who are you and how did you get in here? You let me in! No, I didn't. Where is Matthew? - Who? - My husband! Where is Matthew? Hey, if this is some type of-of roleplaying game... Where's Matt? Where is he? Look, I don't know who Matthew is, and I don't know what this is, but I'm not turn... I'm gonna call the cops. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Call them and tell the truth... we're screwing! Yeah, and somehow, someway, you caught a conscience and now you feel guilty. What are you doing? You asked me to spend the night like you did every other night this week. Hello? 911... We're both workaholics. It's perfect. What are you doing? Why are you trying to mess this up? Is there an emergency? The wrong number. I don't remember any of this. Mercedes, I'ma tell you like this. God... You need to lay off the alcohol. When you got your stuff together, call me. Deshaun, I did not sleep well. I could really use a coffee. It's your girl, Faith. Deshaun, you're passing it up. Excuse me? Miss Johnson, you must have me confused. You made it very clear that once you're inside the car, you want complete silence. Where are we? Your office, ma'am. My office. Anything else I can do for you, Miss Johnson? Um... one moment. - Hello? - Where are you? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm... I'm okay. Um, I think I'm here. Okay, I'm on the way up right now. Great. Good morning, Miss Johnson. Merry Christmas. Good morning. Can I help you with anything, Miss Johnson? Sorry, I, um... My mind drew a blank. Long night. Um... I understand. Would you like for me to escort you to the ninth floor? No, no, no, I got it. Um... Let me get that for you. You have a great rest of the day. Thank you. Nine o'clock, you have Ms. Dogmeyers. Ten o'clock, you have the Wayans. Eleven o'clock, you have Eleanor Murphy. Something's different. Good morning, Miss Johnson. She just lost her pet rabbit last month, and this month, her poodle's at the vet with a broken leg, so she's devastated... Good morning, Miss. Johnson. And she feels like her world's falling apart. A bunny? Whatever you do, do not call it a bunny. It's Puffy Murphy. She looks at it as like a family member or something. Then, at 12:00, you have a noon luncheon to go over the Black Money social payment app possible merger with both CEOs. Woo-hoo! If this goes through, we're looking at going public in a year! Is that all? As usual, go over the rest of your schedule at lunch. Have a great day! Uh-huh. Stanford? I didn't go to Stanford. Wow. I just don't feel valued anymore. This year, he thought it was a good idea to fly the G5 instead of the Global to visit my parents. Imagine that, the horror of flying on a G5. Better yet, he thought we should fly commercial during the holidays! Ugh, god only knows what he'll get me for Christmas. Last year, I told him exactly what I wanted, and somehow I ended up with the ugliest emerald necklace you've ever seen. Wish I would've known that before I spent 400 grand. Oh, it's always money, money, money. Let me tell you something. I logged in to his computer. He's secretly been trying to buy a new Ferrari. I sense a midlife crisis. I need to reschedule. Uh, I assume no charge for today. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Everything okay? Yes, I just need to get some air. You can't. You're booked solid. And you have that luncheon in an hour and a half. I'm sorry, Mercedes, but today is not a good idea. It wasn't a question. Reschedule. We can't just cancel on everybody. It makes us look unprofessional. Look, I didn't sign up for this... Stop! I said reschedule. Drive. - I gotta go up and see it. - Must see! Just like I said, listen to the woman, okay? Miss Johnson, you must have me confused. Mercedes, it's me. Faith! Hey, girl, you should've told... Bitch! Uh, okay... You got some nerve speaking to me after what you did... You slut! First of all, why are you talking to me like that? I am not afraid of you like everybody else. Of course you're not! You're my best friend! No, save that! Save it! You slept with my fiancé. So stay the hell out of my life. Faith! But... Slept with... okay, this is getting crazy. I told you, Miss Lady, I cannot get used to that. At least you know the truth. I... guess I need to find you something to eat. Okay, look this way. Grace, can we get some light on? Perfect, perfect. Give us a smile... smile. Okay, yeah. Okay, she's a... Okay, there you go, all right. All right, smile, honey. It's your big night. Of course you do! You look so beautiful! No, you're not. Lots of people go alone. Waiting for him to ask her out. Boys are so immature at this age. I didn't go around hurting people's feelings. And honey, you stay who you are, okay? Now, smile! Hey, as the owner of this place, is there anything you want to say? Uh, yeah, sure. Um, wishing everyone love, happiness, and success during this holiday season. - Cheers! - Nice. Well said. So, um, you enjoying yourself? You know how I feel about the holiday season. It's what I like about you, Mercedes. You have no life. So, how old are you now? Twenty-seven? Twenty-eight? Twenty-eight. Wow, I'm 56. It's taken me 35 years to get all that I have. There's so much about you that reminds me of myself. You fierce, no-nonsense shark. Knows what to do. All work and no play. That's why you're gonna rule the world. But look around. See all these losers. They'll always just be employees. But not you and me. We show up. We do good. We pretend to care. But these losers? They choose families and husbands and wives. But you and I? We choose success. And that's why we will never lose. But Rachel, on the other hand, hm... she's got a choice to make. Gorgeous! So pretty. Or we make it for her. Amazing Christmas party. Oh! Thank you so much for the wedding gift. Brian and I are so appreciative. Uh, excuse me, ladies. I'll, uh... I'll let you mingle. Thank you so much for bringing me over. I won't let you down. I know you won't. We're all packed. I'm so excited for our honeymoon to Paris! About that. I, um... I need you to push that back. It's not a good time. I need you here. Okay. I'll let Brian know. Good. Oh no. Well... I guess it's only me and you now. Thank you for letting me barge in on you like this. I know it was last minute. Girl, it's no problem. That's what friends are for. Oh, one moment. That's my son. Hey, little man! Mm! Hi, Mom. I have a surprise for you. Oh, you've got him spoiled, you know that? Please, nothing else before Christmas. Aw, Mom, it's still Christmas season. RJ, it's in three days. I packed him some extra clothes. Thank you. And I was thinking, um... Maybe I could start bringing him to school. You know, he was so upset last week. And maybe it would be a little bit... Gina, I'm his mom. I know. I know. It was just a suggestion. Bye, Mom. I love you. Okay, babe. See you later, okay? Thank you. Just... think about it. I will. Okay. Bye bye, sweetheart. See you soon. All right, you ready for the surprise? Let's go! This is Mercedes. Hi, nice to meet you. How are you? You're a handsome young man. Are you hungry? No, ma'am. I already ate. - Okay. - Can I go play some Xbox? Not for long. You heard what Gina said. And not until you're finished with your reading assignment. I hate reading. Okay, okay, how about this? Once I'm done here, I'll come and we'll read it together. Thanks. Deal. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. He is something else. He's adorable. I put him through so much, but thankfully, he hardly remembers it. He just knows he has two mommies. What happened? I lost custody of him when he was three. I was in the streets... Drugs, living the fast life. And one day, I woke up and left him alone for two days. I tried to get clean after that, but I couldn't forgive myself. I missed him so much. Then I got the job at Morgan's, and I finally got clean. He's my world. I just wanna be there for him. I'm so sorry. Girl, I'm strong. It's one thing to throw insults my way. But I hate it when they do it to him. He's too sensitive. He'll be tough, though. He's just like his momma. But enough about me. I know you didn't come all this way for that. Talk to me. I'm worried about you. Well, I know this might sound... crazy, but... I'm living in an alternate reality. Like... what do you mean? Just two days ago, I was married with two kids. My parents were alive. And... yesterday, I woke up next to a man I had never met before. I have no kids, no family, no life. And I run the largest company in the country. I have everything anyone could ever want. But at the same time, I have nothing. I know I sound crazy. Kind of, but girl, in my line of business, I've heard stranger things. Were you at any parties recently? Maybe you were drugged. This is gonna sound ridiculous, but... I made a wish. A wish? Yeah. I didn't think it would come true, but it did. And now I'm living in her reality. Whose reality? Mercedes. Aren't you Mercedes? Yeah, kind of, but it's just... You know what, girl? I'm here for you. Whatever you need. Thank you. Oh my god... The grieving process is never easy. It's one day at a time. And don't let anyone put a timetable on your grief. Okay? Now, continue. I wanna hear more about this dream. Well, I was back home, in Fort Worth. And, uh, Wolf and Francis and I would pick berries in our back pasture. And while back there, I saw Puffy, just sitting there, staring at me. And I run up to him, and I was saying, "Puffy, it's me! It's Mommy! Don't you recognize me?" He was just keep backing up, like he didn't even know who I was! And I was running after him, and I was crying and calling after him, and... "Puffy, it's me! It's Mommy!" Just... you know what? Uh, can we take five? Uh, let me... Can I talk to you for a minute? Girl, what's wrong with you? What has gotten into you? You can't be seen with her. It's bad for the Mercedes Johnson brand. We have a huge network TV interview in two days all about this merger, okay? - You chose Christmas Eve. - I know. You hired me for a reason. Now, I'm telling you this needs to stop now. Sitting in your office is one of our highest-paying clients. I do not need to tell you that she owns half of this town. Your friend is embarrassing us. Rachel, I know. Just give me a couple minutes, okay? Five. Girl, I was... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, this is my business, okay? And everybody might not understand. Well, I'm sorry. This is me. You know what? Never mind. Okay, look, look, look. I'm under a lot of stress right now, okay? I went to sleep somewhere and I don't even remember how I got there. So just be patient with me. That's why I stopped by to check on you. Because of my son, and me being so overprotective, I always keep my cameras going. I saw this last night. Oh my... You didn't even say goodbye. I was worried sick. I don't even remember doing that. Are you sure in a position to be counseling... Mercedes, time's up. I can't even deal with this right now. It's about time. Miss Johnson, do you want her banned from the building? - Yes, please. - Come on... You better get your damn hands off of me. - I'm going! - Let's go. Get up out of here.

Don't worry, this is gonna be a smooth interview. We're on in three, two... Hello, everyone, and Merry Christmas Eve. It's your girl, Valerie Jenkins, and I'm coming live from the office of Mercedes Johnson Marriage and Family Enterprise. Now, we're gonna be discussing everything from the empire that she built to the new merger. But first up, it's an honor to finally meet you. Likewise! How are you? Blessed, we're blessed. That you are. You are truly a woman that wears so many hats, and always working! Now, I understand you're even working tomorrow on Christmas, correct? Look, people always need help, especially around the holidays, for many reasons. What are some of those reasons? I would say our first priority reason is loneliness, which is why we make ourselves available 24/7. An angel too? Amazing. Now, in addition to being a Fortune 500, you know, mogul that you are, you're doing a merger with a social payment application called the Black Money App. But this type of partnership with a company like yours is... new. Yes, it is. Um, our desires aligned in wanting to give back and... And provide healthier and safer, uh, communities. There's so much mental illness in under-served communities. And a simple conversation can make a world of difference, which is why I am super excited about this merge. Um, we're gonna create an app that will allow us to be available 24/7. Sounds amazing. And with every transaction, um, a percentage will go back to under-served communities in building educational outreach programs, uh, hospitals, community centers, whatever it takes. So there you have it. And you heard it here first. Black Money App, Mercedes Johnson, a powerhouse merger changing the future and setting the standard? Okay. Now, when you're not saving the world, what do you do to take care of you? I mean, I'm sure everybody's dying to have you over for the holidays. Actually, it's the opposite. I don't buy that. I have a brave and courageous friend... who has taught me... what being a true friend really is. My selfishness... kept revealing how undeserving I am. But her kindness made me see. Candy, if you are watching... I am so sorry. Well, I hope she is watching. She sounds like an amazing friend. She is. Thank you again. Mercedes Johnson. And cut! What was that? Are you kidding me? Can she stay on script? - My job. - Are you kidding me? Can you stay on script? Oh my god! Where are you going? Are you trying to throw this all away? I get it. I get it that you suddenly care. But let's not lose sight of why we are here. The person I know doesn't care for anybody, just the goal that's in front of her. That's what you taught me! Now, I need you to get back in there! I taught you wrong. You're supposed to care. You're supposed to have a heart. Look, I made some terrible decisions. And now look at me. I'm alone. We just closed one of the biggest mergers in history! Either you get it together, get your head in the game, or... or I go to James and the rest of the board. Let them know there's no more room for you here. Enough is enough, Rachel. You're fired. Are you kidding me? You can't fire me! I helped build this company! I just did. Hey. I was on my way to you. Girl, after hearing you blast me all over TV, I said, forget the anger. I forgive you. No one has ever done anything like that for me. And I meant every word. Thank you for opening my eyes. And for being such an amazing person. And an amazing mom. Stop it. You're gonna make me cry. You already crying. Let's go get some drinks. Oh yes, girl, please. I need a nice cold one. I need a keg. ♪ Can't sleep at night David... Please help me. I just wanna go back. Please. I'll do anything to go back.
