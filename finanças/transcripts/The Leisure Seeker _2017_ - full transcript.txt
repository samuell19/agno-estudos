(SONG PLAYING) Stayed In bed all mornin' just to pass the time PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: (ON RADIO) It is time to show the whole world that America ls back.. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And It's too late, baby, now, It's too late Though we rally did try to make It something' Inside has died, and I can't hide And I just can't fake It, oh, no, no' - Hey. - Hi. Hum? It's me. You ready? Jane will be here any minute. I made cake for dad. (DOOR CREAKING) Oh, God. Is this a joke? - Will. - Hey, Lillian. I'm glad I got you alone. I wanted to tell you that if you guys get busy with your mom at the hospital, I'm more than happy to look in on your dad. - But they're not here. - What? The house is empty. I tried to call, but... I think mom's turned off the cell phone we bought her. Come to think of it, I heard someone turning on an engine this morning very early. What engine? Dad's car's right here. Oh... - Oh, my God. - I don't believe it. Jane. Mom and Dad are gone. And you won't believe it. So is the Leisure Seeker. (SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) Take a right here. That's it. Good. Couldn't you have worn something more comfortable to travel in? And I think you've exaggerated a bit with the eau de cologne. But you do smell nice. - Darling? - Mmm-hmm? Did you fart? Excuse me? (CHUCKLES) You did. I did not. You can't be talking like that. What are you saying? (SNIFFS) Hon, do we need gas? We need gas. Let's stop at Stuckey's. We could get one of those pecan logs. - Where? - Our Stuckey's, hon. Try to remember. Okay, boss. Just as you say. - Like always. -(SCOFFS) Yeah, right. (SONG PLAYING) You have no place for us "in your reverie Goodbye, my love... Hey» are you crazy? ELLA: ls the store closed? Oh, we really wanted one of your delicious pecan logs. - Opening soon. Just gas now. - Oh, no. You hearing this, hon? Every summer, we'd head south, we always stopped at Stuckey's. Our kids, Jane and Will, they just had to have their pecan logs. We were visiting my family in South Carolina. That's where I'm from. My husband John, on the other hand, he's a real Yankee, born and bred. Uh, okay. Oh, they were wonderful trips, weren't they, John? Well, I guess I'm just a natural born tourist. I love to travel. Smoky Mountains, Six Flags, Williamsburg. You ever been to any of these places? - We're from Syria. - You are? Oh, how interesting. Well, you should go. They are amazing. - Ninety one dollars, ma'am. - Yes, of course. My husband John, on the other hand, he's a much more sophisticated traveler than I am. He thinks travel should "broaden the intellectual horizons," whatever that's supposed to mean. I just love chatting with different people. Here. There you are. - Have a nice trip. - Let's roll, hon. Nice visiting with you. WOMAN: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What a nice woman. She found one in the store room. Its expiration date is, oh, my goodness, last April. I think it'll still be all right. Would you like a little taste, hon? I want a burger. It's not lunchtime yet. I want a burger. Hi. My name is Chantal, and I'll be your server. Hi, Chantal. I'm Ella. This is John. Guess you're stuck with us. - I want a burger. - Might I recommend the Chow Attack? Only $9.99. That comes with a burger, large fries, a slice of apple pie and a Happy Swirl. "A Happy Swirl"? I have no idea what that could be, but it sure sounds promising. - I want a burger. - So we'll have a Chow Attack for Mr. Grumpy here. Okay. And you, madam? - Just water. - Nothing to eat? I'll just take a little sip of his Happy Swirl. Okay. Would you like anything else to drink? Coke? Beer? - No, that'll be fine, thank you. - I want a burger. - Burger, please. - Uh, that'll be all, Chantal. Thank you. You're so welcome. I'm just gonna stretch my legs. - You stay put. - Okay. Okay. Do not move. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) JANE: I know, Dr. Tomashevski. I'm fully aware. I'm not sure what else to say. I'm just hoping that they haven't gone too far. (SCOFFS) I understand. Okay. Doctor, my brother just pulled up. We'll let you know if we hear anything. Any news? Bo? I checked all the supermarkets. Nothing. I seem to remember it was your brilliant idea that they keep that monstrosity. Nice work, kiddo. There has to be some sort of explanation. - Yeah. They ran away. - But from who? (PHONE RINGING) - Hello? - ELLA: Will. Mom, where the fuck are you? Will, honey. Please don't use that language with me. - Never mind the language. - You need to calm down. If you raise your voice, I'll hang up. Mom, what is this craziness? You knew I was coming to get you. Why are you not here? We're just taking a little trip, Jane. We won't be gone long. "A little trip"? Where? This is just something I really need to do with your father. I can't believe this. We decided everything. Will was gonna stay with dad. I was gonna come... Your father and I didn't decide a thing.. You and Will and those quack doctors did that for us. That is the basis of Hemingway's narrative. James Joyce saw the beauty of it. Joyce acclaimed him, called him a giant. But not here. Not in America. Here, we praise the hell out of our brilliant darlings, and then we kill them. You tell dad to turn that jalopy around and get right back home. Try to understand. Just let me have this vacation with your father. "Vacation." Now it's a vacation. You know full well that dad can't drive in his condition. Your father's perfectly capable of driving. He's doing very well. Mom, please. At least just keep the cell phone on. Kids, we'll manage. We love you. - Where are they? - I have no idea. No idea, Lillian. ...that when we die, who we are ends. This is it. That's all there is. It's so beautifully crafted. It's a work of poetry. And it's prose. Prose that is poetry. No, yeah, I could see that, definitely. You can just ignore him, you know. Oh, no, it's super interesting. He's being very nice. Prose that is poetry is Hemingway's secret. Do you have any idea how difficult that is to do? For sure. John, leave the poor girl alone. No, but it means, because people have confused his simplicity, his economy of word, with banality. - Have you read... - You want any special sauces - for your burger? - No, no, we'll be fine. - Thank you, Chantal. Thank you. - Enjoy. I just wanted to ask her if she'd read The End of Something. John, eat. You want me to cut it up for you? No, not necessary. Don't forget your pills. Oh. - How is it? - Mmm. And now yours. I'm gonna chase mine with this famous Happy Swirl. I don't see how you can just sit there eating. We should call the police and get Andy to track their credit card spending. Hopefully, mom hasn't lost her marbles now as well. Maybe they’re just out for a short spin. I mean, where are they gonna go? The camper needs to be serviced, Jane. What if there's an accident? What if someone sues dad? We need to figure out where they're going and intercept them. And yet she continues to eat as if it's nothing. (SONG PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) ELLA: Everybody came to my cousin's wedding. They sat us at that great big table next to the picture window. Now, who was there? Do you remember? Me? Yes, John. You were there and I was there and the kids were there. Do you remember? Oh, God. Oh. Oh. Oh, God. We're fine. John, that was amazing. (LAUGHS) - I can still do it, can't I? - Yes, you can. Okay. Here, here. Look. You take that road. Ol' Route One. We must have driven that a thousand times. We're heading south? That's the plan. To your people. What people, John? My parents are dead. They're all dead? I wonder what it's like up there. If it's a joyful place, all singing and dancing and Happy Swirls all day long. What do you think, John? What it's like, you know, after. - (SONG PLAYING) And I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah Windshield wipers slapping time I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no MAN: Hi. ELLA: Hi. WOMAN: Hi. Welcome. ELLA: We registered online. Name is Spencer. Come along, my darling. Ah, perfect. Perfect, perfect. Good. - You ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. That's good. - Thank you. Watch your head. WOMAN: Come on, guys. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Hello there. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Whoa. Check it out. '75 Winnebago Indian. It's a gift from my parents. I named it the Leisure Seeker. (BOTH LAUGH) My husband hated it at first. He thought it was kind of low-class. But he kind of got used to it. We've had a lot of wonderful trips in this old rust bucket. Look at this old beauty, babe. - Look. - Yeah, it's great. So, have you folks been on the road long? No, we just started. We're headed south down to where I grew up between Charleston and Savannah. - Oh, it's so beautiful down there. - It is. It's beautiful. We'd always go there on vacation, but this time we're going further south, all the way to the Florida Keys. - Wow. - Yeah. I'm finally taking John to see Hemingway's house in Key West. You ever been there? No, we haven't. Hemingway was a Confederate general, right? No, silly, he was a writer. (ALL LAUGH) Didn't he commit suicide? He did. And I never understood why. John knows all about him. He's always wanted to see that house. Every year, I'd promise him we'd go, but you know how it is, traveling with little kids. We've seen Melville's place. That's near to where we live. He's a writer, too, you know. He wrote Moby Dick. Very, very interesting. Actually, it was a pain in the rear for my son Will and me. - But my daughter Jane, she loved it. - BOY: Mom! Dad! I think that's why she became a professor. My husband, John, is so proud of her. But my son Will, on the other hand, you know. He's still struggling to find his way. - He just doesn't know what he... - Where are we? - We're not home. - No, hon. We live in Massachusetts. This is Pennsylvania. What the dickens are we doing in Pennsylvania? We're on vacation, and we're having a whale of a time. Yeah. Not me. I want a cup of tea. This is my husband John. John, these are our neighbors. - Hate to say it, but we... - It's getting really late. It's, uh... We gotta put the kids to sleep. - Bedtime stories. - Maybe another time. Good night. Say goodbye, John. I want a cup of tea. Well... I'll make your tea when I'm good and ready. I'm quite comfortable sitting here. I want it now. You'll only be up peeing all night. -(LOUDLY) I want a cup of tea. - Shh. We're not the only ones here. If you want a cup of tea, you go and make It yourself. You're not an invalid. That is exactly what I will do. Hey, darling. "Would you like a cup of tea?“ I give up. Drink that. Into bed. You coming? In a minute. (SIGHS) (SOBBING) (EXHALES) (EXHALES) (ENGINE REVVING) Bye-bye. Good morning, Johnny, my love. How are you, honey? Goodness me. It occurred to me this morning that I should replace the water filter. So I did and then I didn't. (CHUCKLES) I mean, the darned thing was as clean as a whistle. It's amazing. And once again, I was compelled to admit that this old contraption isn't all bad. I mean, of course there are infinitely better means of transportation, but there is no denying that one gets an exceptional sleep on that stupid bed. What about you, my princess? Do you feel any peas under the mattress? No. (LAUGHS) I'm so happy when you come back to me. I was only just outside the door, sweetheart. - You have pain? - No. Good. Where are we exactly? Chester County, south of Philadelphia. - Chester County. - Mmm-hmm. One of Peon's three counties. I am so glad to be back on the road again. (SIGHS) Let me make you a cup of coffee. John? What's happening? Where are we? It's so nice when you forget to be forgetful. Too bad it ends so quickly. I just can't get used to it. What are you saying? Nothing. I'll make the coffee. You should get dressed, my love. - Come on, slowpoke. - I'll go. I'll go. How about we stop at old Chesapeake? The children used to love that, and you didn't mind it so much. Old what? That, uh, historical village in, in Virginia. Maybe Dan isn't after all. Hmm? What are you talking about? He's not dead, is he? - Who? - Dan. (CHUCKLES) Oh, my God. You mean Daniel Coleman? (LAUGHS) What is going on in that mind of yours? You’re just like Gretta. - Gretta? -"Yes, the newspapers were right. "Snow was general all over Ireland. "It was falling on every part of the dark central plain." All right, all right. I get it. The story by Melville. Joyce. The beautiful James Joyce. I'm glad you can at least remember something. Gretta Conroy. You're just like her. You thought of him your entire life. What on Earth are you talking about? We'd go to Charleston and you'd sneak off to Savannah saying you were going to see your aunt. I don't believe this. I mean, if Daniel Coleman is alive, and that's a big if, he's been living in Daytona for the past 30 years. Daniel Coleman. Honestly. Ella, where's my gun? Uh, we... We didn't bring the gun. We didn't? No. No, we definitely did not bring the gun. But we always do. Fire. -(CHUCKLES) -(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) Right face. March. CLERK: Two people, single day. That'll be $88, ma'am. Goodness, you've become pricey. It's $40.99 per ticket, plus taxes. When we used to come here with the kids, it was $10 for the day. When was this? Back when we were a colony? Oh, ha-ha. Very funny. What an asshole. Uh, enjoy your visit. - Thank you. - Welcome. Did you call him an asshole? No, no. I just said, "Ah, so..." (LAUGHS) ELLA: Let's go see the library. You used to love that. JENNIFER: Mr. Spencer? Mr. Spencer. It's me, Jennifer Ward, class of '93. - How are you? - Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, miss. - I'm afraid my husband... - Jenny Ward? It's you. How the devil are you? I'm so... So happy to see you. How did you do at Columbia? Oh, you've graduated by now. Oh, yeah. Gosh, I... I can't believe you remember me. I can't believe it either. A lot has happened since then. Um, Michael, Emily, this is Mr. Spencer. The most inspiring teacher I ever had. - Hello, Mr. Spencer. - Hi, Emily. Hi, Michael. Well, what was the name of that friend of yours? Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Lauren Mitchell. Lauren... That's it. That's it. The two of you, you were always laughing and... - Gosh. - Yeah. Yeah, we were. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I... I'm just so happy to see you. Oh, me too, Jenny. Me too. Bye, Michael. Bye, Emily. Bye, Jenny. "Me too, Jenny. Me too." I mean, you can't remember the names of your own kids, but you do remember that Jenny was always laughing. I'm, I'm speechless. I mean, what goes on in that head of yours? She was such a good student. Oh, well, that explains it all. Hey, hon. Did you know that Tennessee Williams had a house in Key West, too? Uh, wasn't he one of those writers you really loved? I think you took me to see one of his plays. John, you hear me? Though I preferred the movie with Marlon Brando. God, he was gorgeous. Ella, where are the kids? They're at home. At home? We left the kids at the house, on their own? I don't believe it. What in God's name have we done? John, they're all grown up. They're almost old. They'll be fine. They've got their own lives. - Seriously? - Yes. Jane is married to Phillip. She teaches college. They've got two kids, a boy and a girl. - Really? - Rosie and Stephen. Rosie and Stephen. They're toddlers, right? And they're very cute. Stephen's 19, Rosie's 21. Don't you remember we went to her high school graduation? Rosie made a wonderful speech and Stephen played in the band. You were very moved by it. Stephen played in the band and... Rosie made a wonderful speech. Oh, you do remember. No, I don't. It's so painful when you don't remember anything. I'm sick and tired of having to remember everything for you. Forgive me, Ella. Forgive me. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't get angry with you. - It's my damn memory. - I know. I know. I know. Come on, come on. I brought a surprise for you. You brought a surprise for me? There's something I want us to do, okay? - Us together? - Together. Tonight. - Tonight? - Tonight. I don't think I can. (LAUGHS) - What? - You can do this. - Okay. - I promise you. All right. So, what are you reading now? - Oh, you're reading Ernest Hemingway. - I can't read anything, dear. Yeah, this is his short stories, but... I can't, you know... - I start a sentence... - Mmm-hmm. ...and by the time I get to the end of it... Mmm-hmm. - I can't... - You can't remember how it started. Mmm-mmm. I can remember things I remember, but I can't remember things I... Yeah. Oh, wow. Now, which one is this? Do you know? - Jane. - Yes. (BOTH LAUGH) So sweet. Ah, now, where are we in this one? Oh, Ella, look at you. I can't believe I'm married to somebody as beautiful as you. - Oh. - It's the Chowan River. Uh, now, who are these people? Down in Charleston. your nephews and nieces. Yeah. No. - They're your students. - Yeah? They were throwing you a birthday party. Look. Oh, wow. Yeah. - That was your favorite class. - Yeah, that... Yeah. That's me, too. - Who's that? - Now, that was Nantucket. And that was that nice boy that Will met. They got on like a house afire. Good pals. I wonder what happened to him. (CHUCKLES) JOHN: Mmm. Oh. - Darling. Darling. - Mmm? Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Get up. Just for a minute. Get up. (GRUNTS) There you go. It happened again. (ELLA SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Wait, wait. Let me dry you off first. - Go ahead. - Here. You're all wet. There. - Easy. - There. Stupid briefs. Look, I bought you six new pairs of boxers. - Why won't you wear them? - I don't like 'em. - Why? - I don't like them. Same old song I've heard all my life. What's so great about briefs? - Control. - (SCOFFS) Six, seven... Whoops. Eight, nine, ten. And arms up and down. All the way up and breathe and down. (EXHALES) ELLA: You know what I love about you, John? Your silences are never embarrassing. Never once in my life have I thought, "I really need to say something now." So, you still see him? Hmm? What are you talking about? You speak with him on the phone. You write him letters. - Who? - Dan. You said he's living in Daytona now. (LAUGHS) Dan? Not that again. Susan Sullivan told us at Maggie Tate's funeral. You were standing there right beside me. You asked about him. Uh, John, that was 10, 15 years ago. All these lies. All these years. "How poor a part he, her husband..." - John. No, John. - "...had played in her life." - Get back here. - Gretta Conway. Can you believe this? He's convinced I'm still thinking about my first boyfriend, who, by the way, dumped me 50 years ago. Mind you, Dan was right to do so, because it would never have worked out between us. Times were different then. I was only 19. (SIGHS) Oh, that was such a scandal. What happened? Well, they sent me to work at my Aunt Rosemary's shop in Boston, and it was there that I met John. He came into the shop, this handsome young teacher. He came in every week to buy a pair of leather gloves. He always said he'd lost the last pair. Eventually, I discovered he had a whole house full of them. (BOTH CHUCKLE) He was the one for me. And this first boyfriend? - You didn't think about him anymore? - No. He vanished from my mind. - "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs" - "and blaming it on you..." - (LINE RINGING) - WILL: Hello? - Hello, sweetheart. Mother. Where are you? For God's sake, tell me where you are so we can come get you, immediately. Now, listen, Will.. We were looking at family slides last night, and we were looking at photos from our trip to Nantucket. - Nantucket? - Remember that? - It was so beautiful. - Oh, come on. And you met that nice boy. What was his name? - Patrick. - Patrick? - The two of you were very close. - Now, listen to me, Mom. Jane and I are seriously thinking about filing a missing persons report. Anyway, I was wondering, ELLA - are you happy in your new work? WILL - You're not listening. You were such a wonderful broker. You could sell some truly ugly houses. Don't you change the subject. Was it because you had an argument with your business partner Richard? You really need to come back and resume your therapy. - The two of you were so close. - Mother. - And I always wondered... - It's crucial, Mother. - Were you in a... - How's Dad? Is he with you? Oh, Will, come on. - Talk to me, please. - Is he taking his meds? - Oh, God damn it! - Mom? Mother. You're killing me. John. John! - Oh, God. - Oh, snap. Grandpa forgot his wife. Oh, please, please, help me, please. Hey, come on. Hop aboard. - Come on. - On that? Yeah, it's a piece of cake. - How? - All right. - Come on, help her out. - All right, I'll help you up. - Here we go. - Okay. - Great. - Okay, go. - All right. Here we go. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) ELLA: John! - John. - Ella. Ella. What the hell are you doing on a motorcycle? They're dangerous, for God's sakes. I don't believe you. On a motorcycle without a helmet. - And who was that guy? - Go to hell. Well, you'll be with me in the hand basket, missus. How you doing, darling? - I mean it. Go to hell. - What? You left me behind. - I did not. - You left me alone. I mean, I don't know where you thought you were going, you and your empty head. Me, going somewhere without you? You must be crazy. - Let me do it, dear. - No. What... John. That's dangerous. (SIREN WAILING) Put your hands back on the wheel. (ELLA SIGHS) John, you need to pull over. - Why? You need to pee? - The police are right behind us. Now, let me do the talking, okay? I need to find out if that fool son of ours has snitched on us. You just keep quiet. Here he comes. License and registration, please. Yes, Officer. Of course. Here. (EXHALES) I'm John Spencer. Mr. Spencer, I pulled you over 'cause I saw you weaving in and out of lanes back there. Yes, Officer, it was completely my fault. - I was trying to open this bottle of... - Ma'am? I'd prefer Mr. Spencer answer for himself, please. Yes, Officer, I was just trying to help her open the thing. "The thing"? Yeah, the thing. The, the, the bottle. (BURPS) I'm gonna go run your license. Stay put. What are you, insane? Don't even think about it. Give me the keys. Shh. Zip it. He's coming back. Just be polite. Do not burp or fart. Don't call him the fuzz. What's going on, old-timer? Thinking about running on me? You two want to end up on "The World's Slowest Police Chases"? (LAUGHS) That's a good one, Officer. - Stay in your lane. - Respect the speed limits, okay? - Thank you. - Absolutely, Officer. Thank you so much. - Have a good day. - Ma'am. Give me the key. Damn fool policeman. (SCOFFS) "World's Slowest Police Chase." Who's he think I am? O.J. Simpson? Our old trips were never this adventurous, were they? Traveling's important. Broadening your horizons. Broadens your mind. (SONG PLAYING) I met a man Who said He knew a man' Who knew' {What was' Going on' I was mistaken' Only reflections' Of: Of a shadow' That I saw - My goodness. - Who's that? That's the littlest one. The boy. He's got a name, John, and it's Will. - Well, yeah. William. - William. (LAUGHS) Is that you? I was pregnant then with Will. Now, tell... Who's that woman standing there next to me? What is her name? “She lived next door to us. - That's right." It's our neighbor. - Lillian. - Lillian. Very good. - Fantastic. - MAN: Ma'am. Would It bother you If we watched as well? Oh, sure, sure. Come on in, guys. Make yourselves comfortable. Oh, thank you very much. - Yes, ma'am. - Here, John. Beer. From the boys. Why, thank you. - Here we go. - MAN: All right. Wow. (LAUGHS) That's my daughter. Well, she's beautiful, sir. (MAN CHUCKLES) - Oh. - Oh. (LAUGHS) And that's John's birthday party. John? Those are his students. They're always around the house. They would even come back after they've graduated. Excuse me. Hi. Where's Ella? I'm here, John. (LAUGHS) No. No, Ella Carson. She's my girl. She's 22. Long blonde hair. She's gorgeous. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) - Is that really you, Ella? - Of course it's me. Who are you? I'm me. John. No, you're not. My John is a young teacher. He's charming. Very handsome. Educated. I want him back. You stole him from me, and I want you to give him back. Oh, boy. If I could, I would. Whoever stole him from you stole him from me, too. (SOBS) John? MAN: One second. Um, excuse me. You haven't, by any chance, seen my husband? He's a tall, distinguished-looking gentleman with white hair and glasses. Uh, yeah, guy like that passed by here about a half hour ago. He did? Where was he going? No idea, ma'am. Then I'm afraid I'm gonna need your help. You see, my husband suffers from memory loss, and I'm afraid he might just wander off and get hurt. - I can't leave my post. - Oh, my... - What about your RV? - No. I... I can't handle that. That's too big. I... Oh, please. I wouldn't ask you If It wasn't so Important. Please. Let me call my brother Terry. It's my fault. Gosh. Hey. Hey, is that him? That poor old fella? No, I told you, my John is a distinguished-looking gentleman. He's got white hair, glasses and a well-groomed beard. I get it. Academic from Yankee-land. I like that type. There he is. There he is! That's him. John! John! Oh, thank God. John! (SIGHS) John. Oh, John. -(SOBBING) John. - Why are you crying? Because you weren't there, and I wouldn't know how to live without you. Not for one minute. Listen. Listen. We must not be separated, okay? Do you understand? Because we don't have much time left. Well, then it's a good thing you came, 'cause you wouldn't have wanted to miss this. This is an extraordinary... It's one hell of a chocolate ice cream. Can I get you an ice cream, ma'am? Yes, thank you. No, no, get me a whiskey. It was so cold, but it was beautiful. Everything was covered in with a layer of ice. It was all shiny and transparent, as if the whole world was covered by glass. I had to take little, little teensy steps to stop from slipping. And I was very cold, but you wanted to go on. Because you were telling me the story of White Fang. And you were keeping your voice low so as not to disturb the beautiful silence. And we got home at 3:00 in the morning, and our hair was covered in frost. And that was the night we made Jane. Jane. What is it? Mile marker 21. Thank you. It's okay, hon. AAA will be here - in about a half an hour. - I can do it. I don't need them. I know you don't, but I don't want you out here in the sun. Come on. We're on vacation. - You folks need a hand? - Yeah, need anything? No, we're fine, we're fine. The AAA will be here in just a minute. How long you think it'll be till they get here? Oh, them? A half hour if we're lucky. - Well, good. - That's what you said. Look. All right, just be cool. We're gonna take all your stuff, and then we'll go. Okay? Give me the phone, lady. That's a nice-ass ring you got. - ELLA: Oh. - Give it to me. - No. - Hey. Not my ring. It's my wedding ring. Lady. Where's your wallet at? Never end a sentence with a preposition. The "at" is implied when you say "where." Oh! There's no need to get upset just because you don't know grammar. - You can learn it. - John, just do what they say. Old lady, you shut your ass up. Give me your purse. It's in the camper. Shall I get it? Yeah. Hurry up. It's huge. Win the lottery or something? It's got a picture of my family in it, and I would appreciate it if you would not take that. Just like eight bucks in here. That's all she gives me. - Does she keep your balls, too? Good... -(GUN CLICKS) - Shit. - Oh, shit. Hey! Put down the gun, or I hurt him bad. If you hurt him, I'll shoot you both, and if you think we're afraid, you're very wrong, because we've got nothing to lose. - So drop the knives, you hooligans. -(PHONE RINGING) - Is that Will? - Yes, ma'am. He's always calling at the wrong time. I don't want to speak to him. Just throw it on the ground. Make sure the safety's off before you start shooting them, sweetheart. Already done it, hon. Put the rings on the wallet. Now, you get along out of here. I won't even call the cops if you hurry up. Go on. Your rings sucked anyway, you old bag! And your wallet's full of bullshit. JOHN: You fellas should consider evening classes. Turn your life around. - It's not too late. - Hey, screw you, Pop! Lucky we had the gun. I thought we left it at home. I thought we might need it. Hon, would you get me a Canadian from the fridge? Yes, ma'am. One Canadian coming up. I'm sorry I couldn't speak with Will. I was held up. - JANE: We're really worried, Mother. - (LAUGHS) Will is getting desperate. I'm going to see him now. Oh, your brother's a nervous nelly. Your daddy and I are having a fine old time. - Where are you, Mom? - Jane, you would not believe how beautiful it is right here. - You're not gonna tell ma. - Okay, I get It. - How's Dad? - He's fine. He's full of beans. You want to speak with him? Hey, it's Jane. She wants to speak with you. - Who is it? - It's your daughter. Take it. Hi, pumpkin. How are you? You haven't called me that since I was eight, Daddy. You've been so much in my head these days, little one. Do you have any idea how proud I am of you? I bet you're making quite a splash at that collage of yours. I mean, It's not for nothing your name's Spencer. Yes, Daddy. Well, I love you, pumpkin. We'll see you soon. Jane. "Jane"? Jane. (SOBS) Mom. I love you, too, darling. I do too, Mom. You make sure you come home, okay? Okay, darling. Listen, kiss the kids for me, will you? And tell your brother that we've spoken. - Okay? - I will... - I will, Mom. - Bye. - Okay. (SIGHS) Hey, don't finish all the Canadian. Thank you. A large one. Perfect. Leave them alone. They're having fun. Allow me to introduce Jane, the all-knowing. Watch her explain how it is to poor Will. Because he doesn't know jack shit. What the hell are you talking about? I'm just saying that there's nothing we can do to stop them. It's her right to refuse treatment. We both know how little good it does anyway. I know that it's better than wandering around God-knows-where in a creaky camper. But you know best, I guess, because you talked to Dad. And you two are thick as thieves. Even when he doesn't remember who you are. I don't know why you are making this so personal, Will. Because you live two hours away and phone once a week? And come on weekends for lunches that are cooked by me. What do you know about... What do you know about spending long afternoons with Dad when he doesn't say a single thing that makes any sense? Do you know what Mom says when she gets sick, and I have to run there in the middle of the night? Do you know what she says? "Don't call Jane. She's busy." You've been telling this story about how I'm the favorite child for years, Will. - It's bullshit. - Maybe it is. But it's the only story I've got. They're just doing what they've done their whole lives. Staying together, the two of them. There's so much love between them, they forgot about us. - Both of us. - Oh, Will. Get off. You know what happened? When was it? Last year. I opened their bedroom door, and you won't believe what they were doing. She was on the bed, and he was, he was kneeling in front of her. I can't even say it. Dad was muff diving? Yodeling in the canyon? "Yodeling..." - I wanted to vomit. - Why? I hope it happens to me when I'm their age. God, what a thought. But I kind of doubt it. For years with Phillip and me, it's been one quick kiss and, "Good night." Houston, we have a problem. Well, just pull over. We can wait. Hemingway isn't going anywhere. (DISTANT SONG PLAYING) (SONG PLAYING) Enemies Of freedom Face the music' Come on, boys, take 'em down' President Donald Rump knows how To make America quit... I want to see. Well, what's to see? You know what this is. I'm gonna have a look. Well, don't go far. Over here, over there USA! USA! Freedom and liberty Everywhere Oh, say, can you see' It's not so easy But we have to stand up tall...

Yeah. - John, come with me. - Yeah. - But this is so much fun. - I know, I know. But you need to come with me now. - We'll get a parking ticket. - See you later, everyone. Make America great again! You voted Democrat your whole life. I mean, you volunteered for Walter Mondale. Don't you remember? I mean, how mad you got when I said I was gonna vote for Reagan? Reagan? Oh, you don't remember who he ls, do you? - Yes, I do. - No, no, that's not true. You haven't the slightest idea. Who am I? What's my name? Oh, come on, John. You know my name really well. What is it? It starts with "El." Lillian. Oh, sweet Jesus. Lillian is the next door neighbor. Im your wife!... El... El... Ella. Oh, my God. I... Oh, God. Ella, my darling Ella. It's just my stupid, empty head. Oh, I'm so sorry. Freedom's on our shoulders, USA! Enemies of freedom... - That's you under that beard. - It is, it is. It is. (BOTH LAUGH) JOHN: Oh, look, there's Jim. Oh, gosh. How's Jim these days? Oh, darling. Jim passed, hon. - Really? - Don't you remember? We went to visit him in that human warehouse. He didn't recognize us. Oh... Well... That's terrible. Pour Jim... - Promise me something. - Mmm? What? You love me. Promise me that when the time comes with me to put me in one of those places... And it's gonna be sooner than later. You know that. No, I'm getting worse and worse every day. Promise me that you'll put the shotgun in my hand... Shh. No, don't. Listen to me, sweetheart. Put the shotgun in my hand, put my thumb in the trigger, and then explain to me so that I understand that this is exactly what I want to do, I told you to do it. Tell me. Okay? And kiss me. Kiss me, kiss me twice, and then walk away. It's like mud season in Massachusetts. Messy but necessary. Just don't do it in the living room, okay? (LAUGHS) Oh, gosh. Damn it. God... “mmm- What have you done? Put it back in. (DISTANT GROWL) I can't find the plug. What's that? What? I heard a noise. What is that? Well, it's unlikely it's an alligator. - An alligator? - Let's get the gun. No, no, no. Let's just go inside. Oh, shit! Ella! I think I hurt my back. Oh, John! John! You'll have to get over here -to help me get up. - Give me your shoulders. "Give me your shoulders"? What do you mean? - Get... - Oh, God! - God. - Get off me! - You're crushing me. - I think I hurt my arm. So what? Just get off. Get off me. Get off me. (BOTH GRUNTING) (EXHALES) Are you all right? What are we doing on the ground? You don't remember? I fell down, and you fell on top of me. Oh, shit. (GRUNTING) Ow! John, I can't do it. Uh, get up, get over here, and help me. (JOHN SNORING) John? Oh, I can't believe it. John! (GRUNTING) John! (JOHN GRUNTS) Hey! Are you crazy? What are you trying to do? Stone me to death? - What are you doing? - Well, your shoes have come off. There. - Thank you. - Yeah. After all you've done for me, this is nothing. Look at you. You're all dirty. (CHUCKLES) Hmm! (ENGINE REVVING) John, what's the big rush? Oh, I could have done with a little more sleep. Oh, my God. It's the moment of truth, Ella. For heaven's sake, what's this? Take me to him. Now. - To who? -"To whom"! To Dan. To Daniel Coleman. I need to look him straight in the eye. Oh, for God's sake. I'm not going to wait for some snowy night for you to finally confess everything as you look out the window at "the snow falling faintly through the universe." lam so sick and tired of this nonsense. He was always there for you, Dan. I've only ever been second best. How dare you point a gun at me? Take me to him. You want to see Dan? Fine. Fine. What are you doing? I'm going to find out where Dan Coleman is, even if he's in his grave, and I'm gonna take you to him. You will? - Sullivan. Sullivan. - Really? - SUSAN: Hello. - Susan? It's me. Who's speaking? You'll never guess who this is. You can't go in there with a gun. I'm going in as I see fit. Fine. Fine. A hundred cops will probably show up and kill us both, but fine. If that's what you want, that's what you'll get. May I help you? Yes, we'd like to see Daniel Coleman, please. - Daniel Coleman? - I believe he's a resident here. - Are you on the list? - We're just old friends. - We're just passing by. - Wait one moment. - You're very kind. John, she said to wait. (SIGHS) - Is that you, Coleman? - Who? Daniel Coleman. Who? I'm so sorry. I think we've got the wrong room. We're so sorry to disturb you. Daniel Coleman. You know him? - Which room is his? - Who? Finally, we find you. I've always wanted to see your face, Dan Coleman. It's all right. It's all right. It's not loaded. - It isn't? - But... I'm not Dan. Where's Daniel Coleman? Hello, Dan. That's him? ELLA: It's me. - Me? - It's Ella. Ella Carson. I don't know you. Two strange white folks walk into my room... This is my husband, John Spencer. - Nice to meet you. - I don't care. John Spencer. It don't make no difference who he is. Just get out of here. - Do you wear boxers? - What? Do you wear boxers or briefs? And this is what you want to know? I want to understand where this fixation with boxers comes from. Fine. Fine. Ask away. Do you wear boxers or briefs? I wear diapers, white boy. Now, get on out of here! Ella what? You really don't remember me. I don't want to remember you. I don't know you. Get the hell out this goddamn place! Shoot this son of a bitch, John. - But it's not loaded. - Oh, my God, a gun. - Guys? - What are you doing? - He doesn't remember my wife. - Is everybody okay? It's all right. It's all right. - It's not loaded. - Guys, let's go. - You gotta go. - He's an English teacher. - Guys. - He's not dangerous. - Let's go. It's fine. - Sir, you're gonna have to go. - It's okay. You're gonna have to go. Just be grateful we didn't call the police. Oh, we are. We're very grateful. Thank you so much. You've been very understanding. We were thinking that perhaps the two of you might need a little rest. No offense intended. This contains a list of all the insurance we accept. We'll call your children, so they can come tour the facility. Thank you. That's very kind of you. And the next time that you guys want to come visit your friend, do it without the gun, okay? - Even if it is empty. - Yes. Yes, of course. Thank you so much. - Goodbye. - But are you sure you want to be traveling around on your own? - It's nice here. - We're fine. Ask Dan. Why are you so sad? (SIGHS) I'm just a little tired. I'm also angry. At you mostly. But also at Dan. Dan? Dan who? Oh, for Christ's sake. (LAUGHS) I know who Dan ls. I was joking. Dan is the fella who isn't in Savannah anymore. He was black. I mean, he is black. He was a little more charismatic at the time. - (LAUGHING) - Wow. Wow, wow, wow. My Ella. John, can we sleep in a real bed tonight? WOMAN: Now, once we get to the event, there will be security there, so in addition to your ticket, everyone take a moment, make sure you've got a photo ID with you. We're still missing a couple people, so we're just gonna group up in the lobby right here. If you just want to gather round... - Hi. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. - How might I assist you? Do you have a room available? Economical. It's just for one night. We have a standard double with twin beds. No, no, no, we can't be separated. No. Well, in that case, we have the Lawrenceville, a beautiful suite with a king bed. Oh, we'll take it. Thank you. That normally goes for $500 a night, But I can let you have it for $320 plus tax. Goodness me, I don't want to buy it. I just want to spend the night in it. (LAUGHS) I've never spent that much on a hotel room in my whole life. The Lawrenceville it is. Guillermo will show you. Do you have any luggage? There's the minibar, some complimentary items, stereo, and in here is the master bedroom. This is bigger than our house. - Can we afford it? - Don't be silly, John. Of course we can afford it. - Um, thank you so much. - No, no, no. It's okay. Thank you. - Here are your keys. - Oh, thank you. Enjoy your stay. (LAUGHS) Oh, Ella. Oh, wow. My gosh. I'm gonna get us a drink. I think we've earned it. Excellent. Oh, look. Hang on. (DISCO PLAYING) Whoo! Quick. (SONG PLAYING) Don't leave me this way I can't survive' I love you.

(GROANS) - Oh, darling. - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - No, here. Sweetheart. - I ruined the carpet. (GRUNTS) - Oh, darling. - I'm so sorry. JOHN: "The old man was thin and gaunt" "and had deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer" "the sun brings from its reflections" "on the tropic sea were on his cheeks." "The blotches ran well down" the sides of his face, "and his hands had the deep-creased scars" "from handling heavy fish on the cords." "But none of those scars was fresh." "They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert." Hello, hon. - Did you sleep well? - Oh, like a rock. - So long since I've slept that well. - Help me, will you? Yeah, that's better. Okay. See you later. I'll be back at the usual time. Well, where are you going? This is not home. No, it's not. - Where are we? - We're in a lovely place. This lovely place have tea? Yes, I'm sure it does. Oh... JOHN: Santiago is the perfect Hemingway character because he achieves inner spiritual success, which is, for Hemingway, what defines true man. He's defeated, but he's not destroyed. At the end of the story, Hemingway observes the old man. Sound asleep. Skeleton of his great fish still lies on the line. And Hemingway writes... Oh... I've lost it. Oh, God, and it's such a beautiful phrase. And I've forgotten it. Oh, dear. "The old man was dreaming about lions." Oh, my God, you know it! You know it! Oh, how wonderful. Excuse me, where are the teaspoons? I wrote my honors thesis - on The Old Man and the Sea. - How wonderful. Oh, gosh. I preferred the movie with Spencer Tracy. There's a quote of William Faulkner where he says, "Hemingway was one of the bravest and the best." "And you can add for me one of the purest." I totally agree. - Oh, gosh. - Teaspoon? Uh, so sorry. Can you believe it? - No. - She wrote her honors thesis - on The Old Man and the Sea. - Wow! Really? (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (GRUNTS) Darling? Mmm. No, no, no, don't stop. Let's just find a campsite, okay? Okay. ELLA: I'm so tired.. Um... If you're hungry, there's some food in the fridge. “Mm- You still don't feel right, Lillian? Oh, don't fret, please. I won't leave you on your own. Lillian? I'll go home when you feel okay. So, where's Ella now? Ella? Ella's at home. - At home. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. This baby's taking its toll on her. What am I thinking? I should be there to help her. I really have to go home now. Wait, John. Does... Does Ella know about us? You know she doesn't. I couldn't bear it if she knew. Neither could you. It'd break her heart. It'd break mine, too. We have to stop this, Lillian. Yes. Yes, we do. We have to stop. It's been going on a long time. Way too long. So, how long is too long? You don't remember? Lillian. It was nearly two years ago. So, do you love me? What are you talking about? You know it's not like that. You said it yourself, this is just between friends. I mean, you're a wonderful friend, Lillian. The best! But I love Ella. Ella's the love of my life. She's everything to me, and we've got a baby on the way, for God's sake. We have to stop this, Lillian. I'm sorry, but we have to end this once and for all. Goodbye, dear Lillian. Goodbye. You get back here, you son of a bitch! - You get back in here... - Ella, what's happening? - ...so I can kill you! - Bastard! - Ella, Ella, what's happening? Oh! Oh, I'm Ella now, am I? I'm Ella now. - Ella, Ella, Ella, just stop! - Yeah, I'm Ella now. What are you doing? - Oh! (GASPING) - God. Where's my phone? Ella. Ella, what's going on? Quiet, you fool. This is the end of our trip. - Hello? This is Station 37. - What? - Could you send me a taxi here, please, ASAP. A taxi? -(SCOFFS) Shut up. Just shut up. -(CELL PHONE RINGING) - WILL: Mother, where are you? - Will, what do you want? - Mother! - Stop calling me. I don't want to talk to you. Go on. Get out. Get out! Ow! - Come on. - You guys call a cab? Do you see any other customers standing around? Now, here's your stuff. It's your nightshirt, your socks, your damn briefs. - What's happening, Ella? - Just get in. Get in. Would you mind helping me load my husband and his stupid bag? Yes, ma'am. You just stay in there. Why are you so mad? I'm not mad. I'm not mad. No, I'm relieved. Yeah, I'm happy as a clam. Would you take us to the nearest old people's home, please? - The crummier, the better. - Yes, ma'am. - This isn't where we live. - No, it isn't. We're at a place where they keep old fools like you. - Ella, why are you so irritated? - Sit down, please. This is my husband John. Um, give him a room, please. Ma'am, we cannot accept new patients without following established guidelines. Establish them, then. You can come tomorrow morning at 9:30 to the intake office. If the gentleman fits the required parameters, He'll be put on the wait list, which is about 10 months. Well, that sounds more like your problem than mine. Now, here's everything you need. His social security, his money, his driver's license. Oh, and there's this. This is very important. This is a photograph he cut out of a magazine. He thinks this is us. He thinks this is his family. He carries it around in his wallet. See what I mean? That is what you're dealing with. Well, I'm tired, and you have work to do. So, he's all yours. Goodbye, John. Ma'am, you can't just... Ma'am! Ma'am, you... She must know you can't stay here. I mean, sometimes she's a wounded buffalo. I know that. Are you familiar with Hemingway's "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?" His wife shot him in the back of the neck with a Mannlicher 6.5. What should we do? Call the police? I don't think they'd take him. Oh, yeah, look at you, coming into my house with your thighs all on display. Slutty. Look at that face. Look at that face, you bitch! Look at you cozying up to my husband. That's my husband, bitch! All romantic. Having a lovely afternoon. What about me? Having kids. Pregnant. I was pregnant with Will then. I mean, I was pregnant. Oh, yeah, right. Supermodel, my ass. You my friend? Worst friend in the world. Jane. Oh, you knew. Jane. You knew, and you never said a word. (PHONE CHIMING) Hey. - Is it them? - Yeah, it's Mom. Hello. Your father fooled me my whole life, and you knew it. Mom? What's happening? - Where are you? - You never said a word. Always on his side. Professor, my ass. What's wrong? I'm at the house with Phillip and Will. We're all here waiting for you. Where are you? Let us come get you. I'm alone. I got rid of your father. And I'm coming back home, or maybe I'm going to the beach. - I don't know. I... - Mom? - Where's Dad? - I never want to see him again. I'm finally free of that horrible creature, who ruined my life. - I don't give a damn about Hemingway... - What the fuck? ...or Melville or those pedantic little lectures... - Mom. That you went on and on and on. And always made me feel like an idiot. - Mom, you have to... - He lived his whole life a lie. It was all a lie. I mean, what do you read in all those books? - It's just lies. - Mom, calm down and listen to me. Where's Dad? I think he's lying about being senile now. He's just an impostor. You didn't leave him alone, did you? You never thought you'd have a vindictive mother, did you? You made me like this.. You. And him. You just go to hell. (GRUNTS) (SOBBING) Where's my whiskey? (GRUNTS) Jane, sweetheart. I don't know what came over me. I think it must have been my meds. No, no, your daddy's fine. I was only joking. I would never abandon him. Jane, Jane, listen, darling. I want you to do me a favor. A favor? Listen, could you go to Lillian, - give her a message for me? - Mom, Lillian is right here. Tell her she's the dirtiest whore on Earth. - What did you say? - No, in the universe. The dirtiest whore in the whole universe. Thanks. Where's my husband? So, what's happening? Nothing. Everything's fine. - But where are they? - I have no idea. But Mom seems very energized. She sends her love, Lillian. Oh. So sweet. Hi, darling. (SIGHS) Now I understand everything. You won't remember this, but you came home one night, and I was cleaning the kitchen floor. I was all hot and sweaty and stinky and... I was seven months pregnant. Ma'am, is everything all right? Is there someone we can call for you? Can't you see I'm speaking with my husband? So you got down on the floor with me to help me. And then later on, when I was taking a bath, you got in the tub with me. And I didn't know anything, but I just... I sensed that you... That you returned to me. And knowing nothing, I forgave you. This fella there, he's a Bulls fan. And Raymond Chandler was a bulls fan, too. Hemingway liked bulls, but they were in Spain. You really should be going. It's Mr. Davidson's bedtime. Don't worry. I'm not leaving my husband in this dump to be treated like a fool. Come on, John. Come on. We're leaving. Pleasure to see you. May I keep this? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Here, dear. - And now... I have to forgive you all over again. - Forty-eight years later. - Thank you, Ella. I don't know if I'm a bitch or you're a son of a bitch. JOHN: Well, I guess anything's possible. (ELLA LAUGHS) - John, pull over. - Why? I want to get down and take a look. I want a burger. John, pull this camper over immediately. I want to get down and take a look. Yes, sir. Oh, look, John. It is so beautiful. Are we there yet? Almost. “Mm- Is this Heaven? Maybe. Do you think a guy can get a burger up here? (CHUCKLES) What are you laughing at? Hey, neighbors. - You going to Hemingway House? - Yes. There's a great restaurant right next door to it. You're gonna love it. - Really? - Yep. I mean... And the Hemingway House, you won't believe it. It's become like the party town of all places. My cousin, he got married like three weeks ago there, and we had the time of our lives. I mean, I got some amazing pictures of it, if you want to see. On my camera and on my phone. You could look at them anywhere you want. Well, you don't want to see them? They're really cool. GUIDE 1: It was acquired by the museum in 1974. Before that when Hemingway and his wife lived here, it was... GUIDE 2: Folks, this is Ernest Hemingway as he looked while he was living down here in Key West, Florida, late '30s. Dark, swarthy, very charismatic-looking man. And also, folks, in every single room... GUIDE 3: Each cat has a very particular feature. They have six claws, and this... (FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING) This is unbelievable. Yeah. Ella, it's a wedding. Come on. I'm so sorry. You always wanted to come here. Now look at it. (GAGS) Excuse me. Where's the bathroom? I don't know. Maybe try outside. Thank you. - Oh, gosh. -(lNDISTINCT CHATTER) You Okay? Call 911. Is her husband or family anywhere around? (MUMBLING) No. No, please don't... No, don't take... My husband John. Don't take me, please. (SIREN WAILING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - Excuse me. - Yes, sir? I'm looking for... Uh, looking for? Help me, please. Are you looking for the bathroom? It's out back, by the souvenir shop. Do you feel okay? Thank you. You've been very helpful. Huh. Yeah. I'm looking for my wife. Sir? My Wife? You'll have to check with the desk inside. That'll be $35, please. Don't worry about it. Hey, hey. Don't try and pull that. - You owe me 35 bucks. - I do? Yeah. In order to figure out what was causing these symptoms, we did a full-body CAT scan. We certainly weren't expecting to find a situation as grave as what we found. The original tumor was in the colon, wasn't it, Mr. Spencer? Yes. I'm John Spencer. But now there's been a blood-borne spread through the lymphatic system, attacking almost all internal organs. To be honest with you, Mr. Spencer, it's amazing she's even alive with her blood chemistry readings. Were you really taking an RV trip? Where is my wife? (EKG BEEPING) John. How'd you get here? I brought you something. “Oh, my bag" Oh... Hi, honey. Could we have some privacy, please? Oh. Sorry. - Put this on. - What? - Let's get out of here. - No. No, John. - Where are your shoes? - Now they’ve got me, they're not gonna let me go. They're not going to stop you, either. Well, they're down there somewhere. Okay. I'm ready. (WHISPERS) Which is the way out? Exit? Just around the corner. You're almost there. You're my hero. John. You're peeing .We're in a taxi. - I thought it felt warm. - Just stop. - It's that one over there. - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. ELLA SIGHS Thank you. Okay. Home. (SIGHS) “mm- “mm- (GRUNTS) You need to change, John. Here. Put your nightshirt on. (SIGHS) I lost all hope in the hospital. I thought I would never see the Leisure Seeker again. I think we both need a good nap. Here, darling. Here, drink this. Drink It all up. “Mm- Come here. You haven't even washed yourself. Come on. Here. Here we go. Oh. Hello, sweetheart. (BOTH LAUGH) Well done, but you can stand down, soldier. John, what are you doing? - We'll try. - Oh, no, no, no. - No, just for a second. - No, I don't think I can. Just for a second. Just for a second. (MOANING) - I'm there. - Yes. You are. You're all the way there. Don't move. - You don't want to come? - No. Just this. Oh, John, I love you so much. Don't leave me again. All right? - All right. - You promise? Oh, I promise. (MOANS) Oh, God. Oh, God. (ENGINE STARTING) ELLA: My darling Will and Jane. Here's our lawyer's number. I've taken care of everything, all the arrangements. There's nothing for you to worry about. Although, I think our final Visa bill will be outrageous. We had a little bit of fun there at the end. I'm so sorry to hurt you like this.. I know how painful It must be.. But pretty soon you're going to feel something else. You're going to feel relief. Relief that you don't have to watch our bodies and our minds fade away.. Relief that the burden we were becoming has been lifted from your shoulders. And you mustn't feel guilty about that. You mustn't. I loved your father very much.. I didn't have much longer,' and I couldn't leave him alone. We were always together.. And I hope we're together somewhere now. Who knows? This was our last wonderful vacation.. We had some beautiful days.. It was our happy ending.. 'Love, Mom. How you doing, kiddo? Sad? (SONG PLAYING) Busted flat In Baton Rouge' Waitin' for a train' And I's feeling near as faded as my jeans' Bobby thumbed a diesel down' Just before it rained' It rode us all the way to New Orleans' I Pulled my harpoon' Out of my dirty red bandanna' I was playin' soft While Bobby sang the blues' Windshield wipers slapping time' I was holdin' Bobby's hand In mine' We sang every song that driver knew' Freedom's just another word' For nothin' left to lose' Nothin' don't mean nothin'hon' If It ain't free, no, no' And feeling good was easy, Lord' When he sang the blues You know, feeling good Was good enough for me' Good enough for me And my Bobby McGee' From the Kentucky coal mine' To the California sun' There, Bobby shared The secrets of my soul' Through all kinds of weather' Through everything we done' Yeah, Bobby, baby Kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord' I let him slip away' He's looking for that home' And I hope he finds It' But I'd trade all of my tomorrows' For one single yesterday To be holdin'Bobby's body next to mine' Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah' But feelin' good was easy, Lord when he sang the blues' Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm' Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee' La da da La da da da La da da da da da da da La da da da da da da da Bobby McGee, yeah La da da da da da da La da da da da da da La da da da da da da Bobby McGee, yeah La da La la da da la da da la da da La da da da da da da da da Hey, my Bobby Oh, my Bobby McGee, yeah La la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Hey, my Bobby Oh, my Bobby McGee, yeah
