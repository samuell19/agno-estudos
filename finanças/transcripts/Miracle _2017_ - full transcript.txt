Produced by In association with With the support of Director of Photography A film by MIRACLE Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you! Do not be afraid, Irena. Guess what? You will conceive a son. A son? But I can't have children. The Holy Spirit will come upon you. Your holy child will be called the Son of God. But I don't want to have children! I've told you to take the keys. Irena, don‘t be mad! Irena, please, let me in! Honey, for fuck‘s sake! Stop yelling, okay? You'll wake the neighbors! Go back to where you came from. I won‘t, I won‘t.... Irena, sweetheart. Honey, let me in. You'll break the door! How many times have I told you? I can‘t stand this. If you don‘t show up at work in an hour, I‘ll... Fire me? "GOOD ON EARTH IS CREATED THROUGH WORK" Little ones. Little piggies... Come to me. You scream a lot. My little piggy... The sky is so strange today. It‘s strange, indeed. And the snow in Spring. That skylight is out of this world. Did you hear that Dundulienė is like a walking magnet? Cutlery can hang on her boobs and nothing will fall. She can't pass by a TV, the antenna will stick to her! Now I get why those old men stick to her boobs! Not only old men. Something is moving over there! No way... What if that “something” lands here? It would feed the pigs. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, our salaries arrived. Pay our salaries! Pay our salaries, how long do we have to wait? We are tired of waiting! We work for nothing! I don’t have money for cigarettes. Pay us! Are you done shouting? I can hear just fine. I am not deaf yet. Why should I pay you if you don't work? You can go. You don’t have to work. Tomorrow there will be a fight here to take your place. What will I tell my children? Tell them that their mommy has finished 8 grades and all she knows is how to feed pigs. Where will you go, Barbora? Where will all of you go? You have to have two degrees if you want to work in a shop! Two degrees! Where will you go? Now, go back to work. Barbora, give more to Curly Tail, – she gave birth to 10 piglets last night. Two months ago we sent you a truck of pork. Yes, yes. Listen. Listen. When I called you last time you promised me that we should have the money on 15th, right? No, we still haven't received anything. Listen, people need money. No, listen to me, people need money! Explain this to our hungry children! Banker! Let the banker through! We’ve been waiting here for two hours, and you just walk in like nothing? I was first! Let me through! Cunts! Where is she going? I just wanted to ask one question. We all have a question to ask! I have to work. I can't wait here all day. I just wanted to ask about… Listen, do I have to call the guard? Get back in the line! What are you doing? I was standing here. But you left. Sorry, don’t you remember, I was standing here a minute ago! But you left. Who does she think she is? I just have one question. Can’t you see we're closed for lunch! Huh? We’re people, too. Here, I have some left…Take it. Take it. I have more. I wanted to ask about the loans, for a cooperative. We don’t lend. Why not? We just don’t. It's just a matter of time before you go bankrupt. We won't! No. Lunch break I'm not buying. I just wanted to ask. The end of the queue is there. What did you ask for? Cigarettes. How many? Two. Very well. Okay. You know, I suggest you buy filtered. They are more expensive, but healthier. Okay. You’re welcome. Goodbye. We have some extra meat. I thought you might need it. I’m on a diet. You can give it to someone, or sell it… You can put it in a freezer. Look. How much do you pay for pork? 350 per kilo. Buy from me! I will sell it to you for three hundred. I will also add a sausage. A sausage? A sausage. You will add a whole sausage? Of course, not a half of it. Not a half of it? Of course not a half – you will give me a whole sausage! Shit, I thought it was just a gossip… No, no, no… The whole sausage? Now I see that you really are fucked... After what you've done, you want to buy me for one extra sausage? You know, even if there were no other sausages left in the whole world, I'd rather eat my own hand. Laima, it was their decision to give me that apartment, not mine. I stood in the same queue. How long? A year? I waited for 10. Hello. Could you tell me where I could find the pig farm? (with an American accent) Where can I find the pig farm? What? Where is the pig farm? Pigs… I am pigs. I mean, I’m the manager of the pig farm. Irena. Irena Sneckiene. Really? What a coincidence! My name is Bernardas. Pleasure. Yes. You can always find everything you need here. Everything you need. Everything? Everything. Very well. Do you have face cream? A cream? Yeah, my skin hurts. I knew you weren’t Lithuanian. Men don’t use creams here. And they don't smile like you. So where are you from? From America. I've heard a lot about your farm. Can I see it? The farm? Yes, of course. Yes, definitely. Can I pay with Dollars? Okay. Of course! Keep the rest. Shall we go? So as I see, as I understand, you say you’ve heard a lot about… That it is the biggest farm in the region… And most of our inhabitants work there. Wait, don't take a photo yet! One more picture? I've got what I needed. Let's go! Is this the farm? This is Piggy. Piggy weighs 270 kilograms. This pedigree boar is called Granite. It has offspring all around Soviet Lithuanian collective farms. It’s a big fucking pig. Breeding more than 2000 pigs per year the workers substantially increase the success of the whole Soviet Union. And this is the centerpiece of the farm, sow Curly Tail. Her farrowing average is 25 piglets per year. Some people are like stones, if you move them, they roll. Alright. But our earth is plentiful for those who put their roots in it. Our maximum was 4,655 in 1984. All the factories went bankrupt in the Soviet Union and there’s been no place to distribute. But this doesn't mean people stopped eating pork. Funerals or weddings here are impossible without a pile of stewed sausages or "cepelinai". What is that earring for? They say, it’s to hear better. You know, the only question is, where do they buy that pork? It can be our farm… Of course, it could be another farm, but then a natural question appears, why not ours? As I mentioned before, this farm is the biggest and the most famous… And we were on television in 1983! How old are they? Usually we slaughter them within a year. No, I mean the trees. The maples? Yeah. They were huge, when I was little. Which one is the biggest? They all look the same. Why do you ask? Who do they belong to? To the farm. Who does the farm belong to? To everyone. Is that a river, over there? We use it for sewage disposal. I thought so. This is my land. What? This is the exact place, where my parents' land used to be. Are you sure? Yeah. Right here. At the end of the village, river, trees, everything matches. So, you just came to visit this place. Right? Actually, I am thinking of buying it. Buying it? The whole farm? Yeah, the whole farm. What are you going to do with it? Seems like this farm needs help. Yes, but... I think, I can help it flourish again. Why would you do that? In memory of my parents. I've been in charge of this farm since '78. I am in charge. You can still be the boss! You think it’s that easy to work here? It will be hard. People haven't been paid for 2 months. I will pay them. What? Nothing, we will talk about this tomorrow. By the way, where can I find a hotel? They don’t exist here. Where do your guests sleep? In the worst case, you could sleep at my place.... There's a spare couch... Don't worry, I like couches. Look. More kids playing. What are you playing? A shop. What are you selling? Good afternoon. Go and play at home. It's not a playground. You can take off your shoes here. This is my father, he was also chief of the pig farm and an excellent hunter. I have more, they don’t all fit here. This is our Curly Tail. She is the record holder for the whole Soviet Union - she had 15 offspring per litter. Wow. This one is mine. For the best breed of Lithuanian White pigs. Are you tired? A bit, I haven't slept properly for a long time. Just a moment. Alright. It’s fine. Have you closed your eyes? You can no longer open them. Temporarily. Blood flows down your arms, legs... Accumulates, causes a feeling of heaviness. In my sessions it's much more important to look into my eyes than hear what I say... To trust our sixth sense. You'll break my arm! Leave me alone, mother fucker! Irena! You mother fucker, get off of me! Get off! I‘ll kill you, fucker! What the hell are you doing? I completely forgot to tell you. This is my husband. Your husband?! This is our guest from the USA - Bernardas. From the USA? Are you alright? I just wanted some water and he attacked me. Cheers! I just want water. Bottoms up! Juozas. Bernardas. Pleasure to meet you. What is it for? The earring? Do you like it? No. Listen, Bernardas, you look like a normal guy. What the fuck do you want with this shit-hole? You don’t understand again? Why did you come here? My parents were born in Lithuania. I want to explore Lithuania, where they came from, and do something good for Lithuania. Good for Lithuania… He wants to buy the farm, invest in it and make it work. Did your parents have a pig farm? No, they had a house before the farm was built. The farm was built after their home was destroyed. I don’t understand. So you're buying all those pigs, which your parents didn't own, and the farm which your parents did not build, just in their memory? I just want to help the people of my homeland, alright? Alright. One needs to help their homeland! But honestly, what are you really doing here? Huh? Let him be, go to sleep. Move. I am just trying to find out the truth. Go, go. Shit. Please, eat. Good afternoon, friends, I mean, gentlemen. I’ve invited you all here to talk about the future of our farm. As you know, last year the farm was not doing as well as we would like it to. Export decreased by 100% and our pig production decreased by 70%. Therefore, we have had to look for new ways to solve the crisis as soon as possible. I’ve invited a man, Bernardas Rimonis from the USA, whose parents… Thank you, Irena, I will introduce myself. Hi everyone! Once upon a time there were three little pigs: Nif Nif, Nuf Nuf and Naf Naf. Nif Nif built a house of straw, while Nuf Nuf built his house with branches. However, Naf Naf built his house with stone and clay. Guess, which house the wolf could not blow down? Maybe the one of stone? Well done, of course. The one of stone and clay. This was the safest house. Would you like to have a house like this? But building this house is not a game. In the past you built your house with straw - it fell down! Now you've been building the house with branches - it is falling down and the wolf will eat the pig! I am inviting you to build a house together: with stone and clay! I will be the clay, and you will be the stones! You breed the pigs and I take care of the business. Strong house - happy you, happy piglet, happy me! Sit down! Piss off! Honorable Bernardas and I would like to… Irena, go away! Go away! Enough! We've had enough of your management! Irena is a true professional, so we won’t manage to build a house of stone without her! I’m the owner, and Irena’s the director. Why is this piglet so sad? I did not ask for your help. See, much better now. Maybe this will help you out. I estimated that the value of your shares is 500 Dollars. Sign the documents, if you agree. That's a lot! Thank you. Thank you so much. You are such a good man! From now on we are in good hands! Thank you! Kids! Kids, let’s go! Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Agne, don’t stand like this, thank him! Mister, excuse me, wait! Wait a second! Thank you, Mrs. Irena. Thank you, Mister Bernardas. Kids! Piss off. Don't hurry, read it carefully, I will explain everything, answer your questions. What if I don’t sign? You don't have to sell it - everything is in your hands. It is you who decides if it prospers or goes bankrupt. Well done. So you know how to cook, too? My mother always worked, I had to cook for myself. My father worked a lot too. And your mother was taking care of the kids? No, my mother died giving birth... My father never told me about it. So you grew up with just your father? Yes. Did you know that the onion is the sweetest vegetable in the world? Onions are like women, they look bitter and harsh on the outside, but when you fry them, they become sweet… Then they become much sweeter than you could ever imagine. It is much more interesting than getting a sweet taste from the beginning. Good evening. Can I disturb you? I remembered that today is a Woman’s day. My wife, despite everything, is also a woman. Oh yeah, a very beautiful woman! It’s for you. Take it. Come on, take it. Stop acting like a clown, alright? What kind of nonsense have you cooked here? Impossible to eat. Next time cut it into pieces! A little kiss first! What kiss? You stink! Irena… Why are you acting like the boss? Mind your place. Pig. She doesn’t dance. Dear guests! Now, I would like to dedicate this song to our savior. We all would. To our savior – Bernardas! Stop it. Bernardas! Bernardas! Bernardas! Stop it. Of course! We have a pope, John. I’ve heard that his mother is Lithuanian. Hey, get out of here! What the hell is happening here? What are you doing? We are doing what we were told to do. Who told you? When? Bernardas told us. Bernardas? But these trees are a memory of his parents! I don’t give a shit! He told us to cut them. We cut them. And I am telling you to stop right now! Cut, damn it. Cut. She can babble as much as she wants. We don’t have to listen to her anymore. We don’t have to listen to her anymore! Who do you think you are? You come here from god knows where and do anything you want? I could ask you the same. Same? … An organizer! Of idiotic, dumb parties. Cutting down the trees? The pigs are hungry. Not a single one has been sold yet. Take care of the farm, instead of cutting down the trees! What did they do to you? Who gave you the right to cut them? Why should I ask for permission? You do remember who the owner of the farm is now? Yes, you are, but… And the boss? You, but… And who makes decisions? Yes, you do, but… That means I don't have to ask for permission. Right? Yes. Where in the modern world have you seen a farm that looks like a Russian fairy tale? Tell me, where have you seen trees beside a farm? It’s against ecological regulations! But you said, that those trees are very important to you. That this is the memory of your parents. I did. But now I am the owner of the farm and I have to live for everyone, not just for myself. Now will you excuse me? I'm going to take a shower. That dress suits you. It's just an old one. The red one is coming. I see... El Dorado. Hello! How are you today? We wanted to ask when we can expect to get our salaries this month? I’ve just paid you. You bought our shares. You haven't paid our salaries yet. You will have to wait a bit, I’ve just started… Maybe you should wait, and we should get paid. Exactly! Fine, I will pay you soon… We won’t work until you pay. Fine, don't work! Have a week's holiday! Okay. Fine. He thinks we are stupid? Let's go on a holiday. Where are the workers? Annoying woman! I've spent everything on them! What can I pay them from? I don’t know, I am not the boss here. Okay, we need to dig out those trees and prepare to build the fence. What about the pigs? The fodder is finished. Take 10 Dollars, keys and a car. But that isn't even enough for a week! I'll figure that out. The workers are on holiday, who will feed the pigs? Me and you now, baby. Here! Very well. Irena. I've heard that a foreigner is helping you with the farm? Investing in the farm? Is he out of his mind? His parents' land was there before the war, father. In place of the farm? Yes. I knew the people who lived there... But I don't remember their children. It's alright. It’s hard to remember everything at your age. It’s great, that I have all the church archives if my memory fades. Irena, if you have any questions, you know where to find me. Thank you, father, but so far I have more answers than questions. It is still not too late for you, Irena. The kingdom of heaven is open for everyone who knocks. Thank you, father, perhaps I would knock, but you know, I've already booked a room in hell, it was cheaper and the queues were shorter. Move, move. Write, hurry up! "IRENA+AMERICAN = HOT LOVE IN BED" What are you doing, little bastards? You little rat! What’s wrong with you? You want me to punch you? You little rat, what do you think you are doing, huh? Alright, alright, don’t cry. I told you not to cry. Ok, ok, stop, don't cry. Take it, wipe your tears. Come on. Don’t ever do it again, okay? Don’t cry, okay? Huh? Alright, everything is fine, don’t cry. Stop crying. Little one. Go on. Go, go. Once you have a kid – you have problems. That's why I never wanted them. And you? I can't have kids. There is nothing you can't solve with money. Let me tell you a joke. A couple who couldn't have a baby went to their priest and asked him to pray for them. "I am going to Rome soon and I'll light a candle for you there", the priest said. 3 years later the priest came back from Rome and went to visit the family. He found the wife pregnant and taking care of 2 sets of twins. "Where is your husband?"- He asked the wife. "He went to Rome to blow the damn candle out.". What are you doing?! What are you doing?! My wife! What are you doing?! Someone help! Someone... Stop shitting around! Stop! Catch and slaughter it! Easy! Easy! What does this mean? It means that you look as beautiful as a chamomile today! What does this circus mean? Whose pig is this? Barbora’s. Is it her first or second pig? Second. Good! Move, move! Move! Can I take it home instead of slaughtering it? Whatever you want! Thank you! You are welcome. I’m paying their salaries in kind. In pigs? I've decided to buy a new brand of pig, this one isn’t economical. How much do Lithuanian whites grow per day? 31 grams. American - 50 grams. But they use more feed. No, they use less. Completely different genes. Where will you get it from? From America. I've arranged everything. Don't worry. I will take care of it. Relax. Leave her! I’ve booked her first! It’s Curly Tail. Leave the pig! Don't worry, mommy. Come here. Let’s go. Let’s go, darling. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. Let’s go. Don’t be afraid, I’m with you. Let’s go. You got a pig, and I got a fig! Go. No, no, no. Let's get away from here. If we lived like pigs, pigs would live like people... Come here, come. Come to me, don't be afraid, come. Here you go, sweetie, come, come with me. Come here. Come here, what's wrong? Good girl. Come on, darling, let's go. Come here. Get in, get in. Get in, darling, get in. What’s wrong? Get in. Come on, get in. This will be a fertile year. Let’s go. Let’s go, darling. Good girl. Mommy, go. We are home, we are home. We are home, darling, go. Go here. That's it, darling. We are home. What are you looking for? Irena, my God, are you following me? Just preparing for renovation. I’ve come up with a new plan for the pig sties. To make it like a modern office in the USA. Yes, sure… What do you need those trees for? What are you looking for? I’m telling you, modernization requires renovation. Bullshit. You like playing tic-tac-toe, here? These are the lives of real people, you know. And what about lives of all the people that were destroyed to build this farm? My parents, for instance? They lived their lives here and your father came, destroyed the house and built his farm on it. And what should he have done? Gone to Siberia himself? And even if he did, what would have changed? There would always be someone else who would have done his job. Someone who wants to live in peace and has to take care of their children. But you don’t have children. Why did you do all of this? Did what? Did my job well? Before her death my mother told me that before leaving, my parents put their property into a pot and hid it under the big maple tree… Help me find it. then I'll rebuild you a new farm with new pigs and pay all the salaries. You'll leave everything to me and leave? I promise. Just help me. Promise? I promise. And leave? And leave. If she told you under the big maple, why are you digging here? Because in the old times the maples grew by the main entrance. To the left! To the left! Where?! Lift up! Lift up! Go! Deeper! Good, go, go, go! Where are you going?! Here. Wait, if the entrance is here, then… This is an old type of cottage! It had two entrances. So if one is here... It means, that the maples could have been here, here and here! Nothing. Nothing. We’ve looked everywhere. Nothing. Not everywhere! Do you like it? Do you like me now? I thought you liked old guys with earrings? Go ahead, touch it. Touch it! Leave her! Leave her! You leave her! What are you talking about?! No, what are you talking about?! All the village is talking about the American bastard fucking my wife! Juozas, everything is professional. I will fucking punch your head – I’ll show you professional! Bernar… Bernardas, don’t! Stop it, Bernardas! Apologize! Apologize! Cunt! Stop it, Bernardas! Don't! I told you to stop, Bernardas! I am sorry. I'm sorry, too. Where will you go? I will find something. Dig! Dig! What? I can’t hear you. Here, dig here! Go! There is nothing here! Keep on digging... Nothing? Stop, we‘ve looked everywhere. Can’t be! There must be something! It must be here! We haven’t looked everywhere. There must be! It must be here! Nothing. Nothing's here. Move! Let me! This was your plan. Wasn't it? Exactly. Stay here with nothing, that's what I wanted! Irena, there is nothing! The maple. The maple. The big maple. Under the big maple! Under the big maple! No, not now. How do we get in there? It’s too dark now. It’s too dangerous. The sun will rise soon, we'll have to wait. Let’s wait in the Cadillac. Your face is smudged with dirt. It's no big deal. Just a little more. Just a little more. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What happened? Nothing. Nothing? No. What is it? I am a shepherd. What? My mother is not my mother! What an idiot. Two weeks going across the Atlantic with a Cadillac. And to where? To this shit hole! To pigs! Half in shit! Digging! Demolishing! Sleeping on a couch. To find this? How can I even go back to the USA after this? We don’t need the USA! The most important thing is that we have somewhere to live. We will buy 5 pigs and we will have 50 in one year! I know how to breed them. In the beginning we will keep them in a shed, later we will build a new farm, a modern one, like in the USA. We? You can take my farm money. Where is it? In the closet. In a vacuum cleaner. She worked for the family of Rimoniai. She couldn't feed her child anymore. So she gave the child to a woman, who was escaping to the USA to avoid exile. The woman promised, that when the time comes, she will send Bernardas home to find out the truth about his origins. Irena, I knew you would come here again one day. You don't remember the first time you were here. Your mother, who was a very faithful woman, brought you here. You were the first child baptized by me. This is you, Irena, and this is your mother. What happened to her? People say, your father was told, he might lose his job due to his wife’s beliefs... She died in a psychiatric hospital… What the hell are you talking about? Pray for them, Irena, let them rest in peace. God doesn't give us challenges which we can't handle. Nobody has handled them, father, they all just died. So where is your God? You can keep the photo, if you want. Clean your shed! It stinks! Mum, I want a candy! I’ve already told you – I don’t have any money. Please, mum! Hello. What happened? Your TV is broken. So what? How can I help? So… Irena! Irena, can you hear us? Yes, I can hear. I am not deaf yet. What happened? You've been unconscious for some time. You are suffering from exhaustion. Pregnancy is a big challenge for a woman your age. Shall we call your husband? Then can we call someone else? I said, that is not needed. It is a child conceived by the Holy Spirit. After the mass I want to invite everyone to clean the town. And don't forget to bring your shovels and brooms! And now, get ready for mass.
