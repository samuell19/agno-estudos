♪♪ [Woman] Something in life, you're always worried about car bombs, shootings. [Man] This is the most resilient community in the world. People survive. People don't break down. People are exposed to awful things here. [Woman] You walk around the corner and possibly a bomb go off or a shooting. It's just part of life, really. There's no point in being bitter. All it does in the end is intensify the situation and it widens the whole wound in Northern Ireland. [Man] We actually are surviving. That's the whole story of Belfast. [Woman] It's really only a tit-for-tat thing. Kill a Catholic, kill a Protestant, and it's returned. [instrumental music] [gunshot] [indistinct chatter] [thunder rumbling] [indistinct chatter] - Harry. - Prime minister. Kippers. What am I doing about Ian's golden wedding anniversary? You got him a leather photo album. Couldn't we do better than that? What are the Irish getting him? Well, Bertie's got him a bowl carved from a tree recovered from the site of the Battle of the Boyne, 1690. Bloody hell. Can't we steal it? Well, we do have form. [chuckles] So how are you doing? Do you feel the hand of history on your shoulder? Around my throat, more like. [chuckles] It's like looking at the Promised Land through the wrong end of a telescope. Prime minister, I've been at this since 1972. I've retired three times. I have more comebacks than Sinatra. Every time there is a chink of light, they drag me back simply because I know them better than anyone. But this time is the first time I really felt.. ...yes, there's a chance. We can do this. Do you say this to all the prime ministers? Of course. Only this time, I mean it. Why now? Well, because young men fight for the hell of it but old men care about their legacy. Now I think this is the right time. Well, I hope you're right. [thunder rumbling] Speaking of old man, Ian disappearing like this isn't gonna help matters. It will keep him sweet. 50 years of marriage. It's rumored that was the last time he said yes to anything. [chuckles] [humming] [instrumental music] [groans] ...Mrs. Thatcher tells us that that republic must have some say in our province. We say never! Never! Never! Never. [chuckling] Bernie, Bernie, you need to go easy on the garlic. I'm telling.. I'm serious. The last -- the last time I cooked the girls said I nearly poisoned them. [knock on door] Ah. Well, don't blame me. Blame Delia. ...and the Protestants wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. and they've been at it ever since. Right. Alright, alright. Meatballs it is, then. Uh-huh. Well, it's not luck we need. It's divine intervention. Hm. Bye. ...of acrimony and distrust that comes with Northern Ireland. Such an outcome is very much par for the course. But if we're talking about public perception we can go back even further. The Remembrance Day bombing in 1987 and that moving and memorable interview given by Gordon Wilson whose daughter, Marie, died in the explosion. I asked her three or four times. She assured me she was alright. She screamed every time. The fifth time I asked her she said, "Daddy, I love you very much." That's what her last words were. What is your reaction now to -- to the bombers the people who did this? I prayed for the bombers last night.. ...that God would forgive them. [indistinct chatter] - Bertie. - Tony. Come through. Did you have a good journey? I did, yes. We came up.. [indistinct chatter] Divide and conquer. Divide and rule. ...to trust them to acknowledge their political mandate? I mean, how can you have a discussion with someone who might murder you if you don't agree with them? ...policing, then we're nearly there but with the marching, we're gonna have to fudge that. Make a new body. Buy us some time.. Yes? Oh, right. Just wait a minute. I'll be back. ...if we're going with your police and that's revolutionary. And you don't give ground on parades? [clears throat] Is there a problem? You know it's his big night tonight. They've guests coming in from all over the world for the celebrations. Well, we agreed it would be fine. The storm has closed Glasgow Airport. Uh. He'll be devastated. Is there anything you can do? We need a clear commitment from.. [clears throat] Hello. Hi. Hello. Uh, Gerry, Martin, bit of a situation. Um, as you know Dr. Paisley is due to attend his golden wedding anniversary celebration in Belfast this evening. Unfortunately, the weather has shut Glasgow Airport. Now, uh, obviously, this is very important to him. Tony and I both agree that it'd be a nice gesture and beneficial to the talks if we could find a way to get Dr. Paisley to his celebrations. Now as it happens, we may be able to fly him out of Edinburgh Airport. Private business jet, bankers. We've been able to pull a few strings and we can get him on board. And there's a very small window of opportunity before the storm shifts. However, before we propose this we need to clear it with you. You know, favoritism and all that. That's absolutely not a problem. Great. Marvelous. Thank you. As long as I fly with him. I'm sorry? Well, as you well know our protocols dictate that senior figures in opposing parties must fly together. It lessens the chance of either side firing a ground-to-air missile or.. Well, surely, we're beyond the point -- Nevertheless.. ...it would also give me the opportunity to consult with the Army Council. Couldn't you just phone them? [chuckles] Bertie, we need to talk. [whispering] What are you doing? Look, he's going home into his heartland but this time.. If they get a hold of him before he's said yes they will change his mind. But if Big Ian doesn't say yes now we are just pissing in the wind. He has to be convinced. How? He hasn't ever spoken a single word to any of us. He hates us. And what if it's a wild-goose chase? What if he doesn't speak? Or what if he does speak and it all goes to hell? Martin, we can't take the risk of -- We have always taken the risk, Gerry. I'd rather it was me and him going 12 rounds than that shower of sycophants that follows him around. He's 81. If we don't get to him now, we will never get to him. [thunder rumbling] Don't do this. Don't cut a deal with that old bastard. I'm not cutting anything, Rory. We're just bringing it home. It's no time for cold feet. We announce a ceasefire. We give up our guns. We negotiate with the Unionists. We recognize we're part of the United Kingdom so the Queen is our Queen. We put all of those things together and we call it a victory. How's that a victory? We were fighting for 30 years. It didn't work. They could never have beaten us but we could never have beaten them either. You should be ashamed of yourself. We're soldiers. There's no shame in losing but stand up and admit it. Don't dress it up like somehow we've triumphed. Politics is a long game, Rory. You have to stay the course. Everything we want, we will get. Maybe not today or tomorrow. It may take another 30 years. Jesus, I invite you to be with us watching over us and keeping us safe. Believe you in me, I would not be talking to that auld bastard if I didn't think we were gonna get there. I pray for an alert mind whilst traveling. I pray you keep this vehicle we're in safe from mechanical failure. Thank you for the commitment you made to me at the cross. Amen. Uh, there's, well, there's good news and there's bad news. Yes, son? Well, the good news is they'll get you to the airport on time. The bad news.. I'm sorry, daddy. We'd no choice. It's no skin off my nose. You'll be at the airport, 60 minutes. Just say nothing. I haven't spoken to him in 30 years. Another hour isn't gonna be any trouble. Just enjoy your night. I wish I could be there. Don't worry, I'll hold the fort here. Okay. [knocks] The jet touches down at 7:00, the weather's closing in so if you're not there, they won't hang around. You'll be cleared straight onto the tarmac, but 7 o'clock, okay? - That's your end game. - I'll be there by 6:00. [siren toots] So far, so good. Do I recognize you from somewhere? Hm? [laughs] I do, don't I? Are you on TV? We're politicians. Guess who I had in the back of the car once? Samuel L. Jackson. Well, I know. He was playing golf. Well, not right there in the back. At St. Andrews. Do you follow the golf? I'm more of a cricket man myself, so I am. You and me both, pal. But aren't you like Irish or something? I just didn't think the Irish liked cricket. There's a lot that would surprise you about the Irish so there is. And what about you, sir? I do not have time for cricket. Ah. Okay, I do know your face. Who are you really? This is Dr. Ian Paisley leader of the Democratic Unionist Party founder and moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church. Cool. And you, sir? Oh, this is Martin McGuinness former chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Allegedly. Uff. It's wild, huh? The rain. "I establish my covenant with you "and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the waters of the flood." You must have a verse for every occasion, eh? How about one for two auld enemies in the back of a car neither one knowing how to make the first move? I have no interest in moves, Mr. McGuinness. Looks like the rain's stopping. [indistinct radio chatter] You know, I, I didn't mean to be disrespectful or anything not recognizing you. I just always thought the IRA was led by that guy with the beard and the pipe, you know. So where do you fit in? You might call me the acceptable public face. [clears throat] Forecast is not good. There will be a lot of unhappy golfers. Oh, but then you're into the old cricket. Nicely played. They should feel free to speak in front of you. There's an opportunity here to see how they really get on when no one is watching. You see, we're hoping that what they have in common will be enough to break down the barriers. That just the two of them stripped of all this bureaucracy and scrutiny will work this out. Bring a real and lasting peace. You're young, aren't you? 25? 26? Still, old enough that you should know who these men are. They are The Troubles. They are civil war. They are anarchy. [gunshots] [crowd clamoring] [siren wailing] I prayed for the bombers last night that God would forgive them. [explosion] [sighs] What? Shut his eyes as soon as he got in. Been like that for the last 10 minutes. Oh, bloody hell. He's 81 and he hasn't been well. Thatcher operated on 4 hours' sleep and a pact with the devil. Paisley has the energy of 10 men half his age. This is just his way of not engaging. - Wake him up. - Hold on. You know what they say about sleeping dogs. It still needs to be done. At the end of this, either we hold the peace or we go back to war. [chuckles] You do have a flair for the dramatic. [rock music on tape] God, sorry! Oh. I am sorry. Sorry. [indistinct radio chatter] Ah, yai-yai. So 50 years married, huh? [scoffs] Oh, you'd get less time for murder. [laughs] I shouldn't have said that. There's only one possible comeback. That I would know all about murder. I walked right into it. Like stepping on a landmine. Oh, God. There I go again. Do you think any of this is a laughing matter, Mr. McGuinness? No, no, no, a -- absolutely not. I'm just trying to break the ice. I'm just trying to get home. We're all just trying to get home. Isn't that profound? [siren wailing] [phone beeps] Do you have a signal? Dr. Paisley, do you have a mobile phone signal? I've absolutely no idea. Well, would you check? Why? Do you think I'm gonna lend you my phone, Mr. McGuinness? No, no, of course not. No, I.. It's just the signal. [thunder rumbling] So this party of yours tonight, hmm? Pints of Guinness and a bit of boogie, eh? [laughs] Oh, sorry, I forgot. Alcohol is the devil's buttermilk, that right? And what was it you said about dancing? Oh, no, no, no, not just dancing. Line dancing. Poor, inoffensive line dancing. Mr. McGuinness, my party is not your affair. But for your information, line dancing is as sinful as any other type of dancing. With its sexual gestures and touching it's an incitement to lust. Not the way I do it, it isn't. [chuckles] I'm only winding you up. No, Mr. McGuinness, you're not. [helicopter whirring] So what's your position on the great Samuel L. Jackson, hm? Would you shake his hand if we stopped to pick him up? Andrew Jackson was the seventh president of the United States. He was a Presbyterian of good Ulster stock. I'd shake his hand. I've absolutely no idea who Samuel L. Jackson is. Oh. He's a movie star. "Pulp Fiction," "Jackie Brown." "Snakes on a Plane." Th -- that's still playing in the pictures if you wanted to go. Uh, Mr. McGuinness, I haven't been to the pictures since 1973. Seriously? [chuckles] Wh -- what did you go to see? I didn't go to see anything. I was protesting outside. 1973. What would have got your goat in 1973? Ah, 19.. Oh, was it "The Sting," huh? All that gambling offended your sensibilities? No. What about you? 1973. '73? Uh, hold on. I'll just phone my grandad. [both laughing] "Enter The Dragon." That -- that would have been 1973. Well, too much violence, eh? No. No, it wasn't that. I know what it was. Of course. "The Exorcist." Mm-hmm. "Your mother sucks.." We protested peacefully outside. Your lot set incendiary bombs and burned them down. [cell phone ringing] Oh. Hello, dear. No, no, everything is fine. Have our guests started arriving? [laughs] Oh, no, I'll be there on time. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Yes, I have company. No, no, nobody important. Alright, dear, yes. Yes, alright, yes. So you have a signal. Could I borrow your phone, please? Just, just for a couple of minutes to -- No, you may not. My phone is not for the likes of you. Alright, okay. It's your phone. Absolutely. Look, if I could just even send a text -- No. [sighs] A text is not gonna kill you. Oh, unless, of course, it's a, it's an order. [chuckles] Oh, come on. Jesus Christ, how are we supposed to get anything done -- You watch your language with me, boy! Don't boy me! Well, do not take the Lord's name in vain. Oh, alright, alright, okay, okay. That's always been the problem with you. - You have no give in you. - Really? That's why we're all sitting up the road then, is it? Uh, just give me the phone, will you? Extend the olive branch. Well, I'd imagine you'd be more familiar with Special Branch. [chuckles] That's good. [both laughing] That's funny. [laughing] [chuckles] [sighs] You've been like this your whole life, haven't you? My way or the highway. It isn't a question of it being my way, Mr. McGuinness. It's a question of it being the right way, of God's way. Oh, because God is always whispering in your ear. Perhaps if you listened a little bit harder you might hear him whispering in your ear too. I hear him whispering, okay? Oh, yeah. Jesus wept. Are you a married man, Mr. McGuinness? Yes, I am. So what does she make of your, um.. ...your career choices? Of the blood on your hands? She's in my corner, good times and bad.. As I'm sure yours accepts -- There's no blood on my hands, Mr. McGuinness. Please, stop. We were at war, never at peace. Yes, a peace that allows your lot to, to rob and kill and use that -- It's not perfect. Well, that's why we're here, isn't it? To sort it out. The final solution. They.. I -- I don't mean the final solution. I -- I -- I mean, I -- I mean, a final solution. [sighs] One way or the other.. I just wanna say, I hope you have a good night. A good party. Well, 50 years, hmm. If you don't mind me askin' you don't dance and you don't drink. So how did you meet her? It was the Titanic. How old are you? Her father owned a grocery shop bottom of the Newton Arch Road, right near a shipyard where the Titanic was built. I was, uh, I was preaching on some waste ground opposite. It was a big crowd. I could see her standin' in a shop doorway, apron on, listening, and my eye kept coming back to her. I said, um, "How proud we should be of the Titanic. It's such an immense achievement." And someone shouted, "The bloody thing sank!" And I said, "Well, it it was alright when it left here." [chuckles] She was the only one who laughed. So when I'd done, I followed her into the, into the shop. To chat her up? Hmm. I'd like to have seen that. Ian Paisley chatting someone up? Oh, believe it or not, I was quiet and shy in those days. Dr. Paisley, you were never quiet. Quieter. She was up a ladder stocking shelves. She glanced round at me and her cheeks went all pink. She asked me if she could help me and I said uh, "Do you have any aeroplane biscuits?" And she said, "What are those? I've never heard of them." I said, "You know, they're the wee plain ones." She started giggling. [laughs] That was that. Ian Paisley, the stand-up comic, huh? [chuckles] Tell me somethin'. After all these years does she still enjoy all the grand standing? The grand -- Yeah, like she never says "Ian, would you wind your neck in?" I mean, you stood in the middle of the European Parliament and called the Pope the Antichrist. I mean, did she not tell you to catch yourself on? She -- she thought that it was a good idea? She did and it had to be sad. You mugged the Pope. Mr. McGuinness, I am not a man of violence -- Do you or do you not believe that a European Union is part of a conspiracy to create a Roman Catholic super state controlled by the Vatican? - I do and it is. - Brilliant. And did you or did you not write that seat number 666 in the European Parliament is reserved for the Antichrist? Oh, fabulous. Do you really, really, really believe all this? You know, I'm not mocking you. You're entitled to your opinions. I'm mocking the poor blind fools that swallow it all hook, line and sinker. They elect you again and again and again. The most popular politician in Europe and the most extreme. All I do is follow the teachings of the scriptures. And I challenge any man to find different. And scriptures told you to burn Catholics out of their homes? - I didn't. - You incited people to do it. I preach the Lord's words. You said priests and nuns were handing out sub-machine guns. - And they were. - Oh, for God sake. Do you know why in nearly 30 years the IRA has never, never once tried to kill you? Because you, with all your bigotry all your Save Ulster From Sodomy campaigning seein' Antichrists around every corner you have done more damage to your own lot than the IRA could have ever done with a thousand bombs. That's a matter of opinion, and you're wrong! Your lot have made at least three attempts at my life. Nope. At least our side hasn't. You can almost taste it, can't you? The hatred. Thick as blood. It congeals in the same way too. Forms a scab that keeps the poison in. But every once in a while, a little just leaks out. Just enough to pollute everything it touches. Imagine the Twin Towers falling. Falling twice. That's the kind of violence we're talking about. And all caused by children bickering. And yet these are our bright and shining beacons of hope. You see, a beating.. ...or a murder, or a bomb that kills two or three people isn't enough anymore. Not since 9/11. It means nothing. For terror to be effective, it now has to be massive! It has to be a Hollywood spectacular. And these men haven't the stomach for it. Not anymore. But there's always a new generation coming up more ambitious, more outrageous. These men and these women they need to be nipped in the bud. [explosion] And your passengers can do that if they can just get over their own poisonous past. How are we doing for time? We're on schedule. In fact, uh, we're a little ahead. Let's lose the security car. [helicopter whirring] Where is the security car? Sir? The security car? It was there a minute ago and then -- To tell you the truth, I wasn't even aware there was a security car. Of course, there was. It was right behind us. Oh, the irony. The great Republican, Martin McGuinness getting nervous because the Queen's men aren't here to protect him. It's not that. It's just.. Do you think someone's gonna take you out? This might be Scotland, but it -- it is Calvin country. Ah, there's no love lost for the likes of you so you might have a point. Or is it your own side you're worried about? Don't be ridiculous. Well, we should have protection. We're politicians. Oh, really? Oh! Oh, yeah, that's what you are, is it? Ah, well, you've come a long way from the wee guttersnipe hurling rocks at British soldiers. Or did the, uh, the balaclava get a bit too scratchy? Now you've a nice suit and shiny shoes. You're quite the respectable little democrat. At least I aspire to it. Can I, please, borrow your bloody phone? No. You're 35 miles from Edinburgh Airport and that is not very far. We've diverted you to the Lomond Hills Regional Park to give them a bit more time. So just drive around for as long as you can. Try not to be obvious. By the time you leave that park we want them singing off the same hymn sheet. Hey, where are we goin'? Sorry, there's a diversion ahead. The road's flooded with all the rain. It's just a wee bit of a detour. It shouldn't slow us down at all. Hey, what are we doin' in the middle of a forest? Shortcut, sir. We'll be joining the M90 on the other side. Shortcut. Shortcut? [tire screeches] [crash] Jesus! What's going on? They, uh, they appear to have crashed. I told you to buy time, not bloody -- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Look, can you hear me? What the hell is going on? [sighs] Are you alright, sir? Are you okay? Yes, I am. I'm grand. - Uh, what was that? - Sorry, a deer. A deer, it just ran right out in front. I -- I -- I did hit the brakes, but we slid. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Okay, so just stay inside while I check on the damage and we'll be back on the road in no time. They're getting out. For God's sake, don't let them get out. We need to keep them in the car. What are they saying? I can't hear what they're saying. [breathing heavily] - There goes your party. - No, don't even say that. Okay. This is, this is no problem. Okay. This is no problem at all. Now.. Just, uh, I'm gonna just go and fix the, uh.. Fucking hell. Just wait. About bloody time. Did you deliberately prang it? No. Okay, no. What am I supposed to do now? There was no blood or fur.. ...on the headlight or the tire. We have a puncture, yes. I haven't changed a tire in.. I -- I've never changed a tire. We don't even know if it's fixable. Well, first, we lose the security car. Hmm. Then we make a mysterious detour that nobody else seems to be makin'. Then we, we crash for no obvious reason. You need to get the spare tire out of the boot. You need to get the jack and above all, you need to hear what they're saying. You'd nearly think they want us marooned out here. You might think that. I suppose in your line of work you have to live with a certain amount of paranoia. It was an accident. It will be fixed. We will make our flight. Yeah, you sure about that, hmm? You get a wee whisper from up above, huh? [engine whirring] Maybe he doesn't want us to leave the talks. Maybe he thinks your golden wedding party is an extravagance we can't afford. Gents, the good news is that the engine is fine. So if -- if you just want to get back in the car I'll change the tire and we'll soon be back on our way. Have you ever changed a tire before, young man? Sir? You have to jack her up, boy. That means we can't be in the back, no! I'm with Bertie now. Policing. We're going round in circles. I, uh, hope you don't mind. I thought it only right to invite Bertie to, uh.. Oh. - What's -- what's going on? - We had an incident. Uh, our driver managed to crash the car. Are they.. No, no, no. No injuries that we're aware of. Uh, nothing too serious with the vehicle. - Uh -- - Where are they? Uh, they, uh.. In a forest. What are they doing in a forest? Walking. They should be near the airport by now. I'm afraid our grand plan to get them talking uh, was, uh, rather misfiring so the situation had to be managed. Where's their security? It was withdrawn. On whose authority? Uh, well, they needed time and a little pressure. So you withdrew their security and allowed a child to crash the car. - And now they -- - Yes, prime minister. Do you think that's satisfactory? The two men upon whom this entire peace agreement depends wandering by themselves in a fucking wood! And your children? What do you tell them about the murders and the bombs and the -- You don't understand us at all, do you? You -- you insist on seeing it in terms of murder. And genocide -- Instead of people fighting for their rights for their country, for their freedom -- I only judge it by the amount of funerals I go to of ordinary, decent people. American independence, hm? Terrorists? French resistance, terrorists? Horses for courses. Do you have nothing on your conscience at all? Sir. Sir, sir, please. Look, I.. - Tony. - Not now. Prime minister. Oh, God! Gerry! Gerry, I can explain. Gerry, it was a shock to me too. But he's very good at making something categorically wrong sound categorically right. Bertie, that is not fair. Where are they? They're wandering in a forest. But they're fine. They're fine. Gerry, this isn't about you. It's not about Martin or these -- these images. You know that. Bigger picture. [grunts] If Bloody Sunday hadn't happened then we would have just faded away. 13 people on a civil rights' march shot dead by your Brits. Oh, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones as I believe you did on that day. Oh, piss off, you smug.. [sighs] 13 innocent people shot in the back, most of 'em. The next day, we'd so many volunteers, we couldn't cope. They were, they were queuing round the block to join us. And you had your license to kill. We were fighting a civil war. And you lost. Isn't, isn't that what this is all about, huh? Your precious army is so riddled with informers you can barely mount an operation. I have a political mandate just like you. You are nothing like me. [tree snapping] [birds chirping] [groans] I grew up working on farms. They're vermin. It's dying. You need to put it out of its misery. It shouldn't be a problem to a soldier like you. Just do it. I'd say the car's back that way. And I'm telling you I don't see them. Okay, okay, about 300 meters on your right there's a church. I don't recognize them. They must be your lot. Ah, these are all illustrations from the, from the "Book Of Martyrs." Oh, if it's not by John Grisham, I probably haven't read it. [chuckles] Back then, the common people had almost no other reading matter except the Bible and "Foxe's Book Of Martyrs." Those who could read could learn of the full horror of the atrocities performed on the Protestant reformers. The illiterate could see for themselves these illustrations. The book is more than a record of persecution. It's a living force and my inspiration. Well.. ...we know a thing or two about martyrs as well. I'm talking about men of faith. So am I. Ten men starved themselves to death for what they believed in. Murderers and bombers. Bobby Sands was a member of your blessed British Parliament. He was a terrorist. 100,000 people attended his funeral. You think they were all terrorists? Your hunger strikers chose to take their own lives. That was a choice their many victims didn't have. And you could have stopped it. - I could have? - Yes. You, Adams. All you lot with your ballot paper in one hand and your Armalite in the other. The government was willing to make a deal with you, but you thought that the publicity was worth its weight in gold, so you wouldn't let them stop. Until one after the other one after the other ten men lay dead. You know nothing about it. I know enough. If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be sittin' round a table now. There's no deal done yet. Bloody hell. Whose idea was this? It was my idea and I take full responsibility for it. No, no, no, no. Well, actually, yes but the buck stops with me. Or does it? Look, we're -- we're all at it. We're in each other's pockets on this. I mean, it goes with the territory, doesn't it? Gerry, Martin didn't need to make that flight. He volunteered. - The IRA Army Council -- - Gerry, Gerry, come on. We know. Look, I'm on your side. Okay? Long term, I fully support your objectives. Absolutely, a United Ireland. And, Ian Kyle Junior, in the short term which, yeah, might actually turn out to be quite long I fully support yours too. You remain part of the United Kingdom. I mean, my grandfather was an Orangeman in Donegal for goodness sake. And the moment that you agreed to your father traveling with Martin, you knew what this was about. So, gentlemen I have a foot in both graves, camps but I favor neither. I favor peace. Now I know it will take a miracle for these two to work things out. And if listening in can make that happen if, as a result, we can divert traffic or switch a signal to improve their chances then I fully support what Harry has done completely of his own accord. So I'm asking you, gentlemen, who may be rightly aggrieved to stand with me in this moment where we are perched so precariously on the razor's edge to see this through and walk out of this hotel and straight into the history books. Ditto. Come on, big man. We've a plane to catch. I've never been one for talking in public, so I haven't. Well, no problem with a small paramilitary unit. Not like you. Tens of thousands roaring you on. [scoffs] It was your finest hour. Can we hear a bit of it? I, I don't have the power I used to have. I haven't been well. Go on, you can do it. Knock it out of the park, huh? Never, never, never! ...some say in our province. We say never never, never, never! I'm not here for your entertainment. Then what are you here for? I don't know. I'll tell you why we're here in this godforsaken church. And it's nothing you don't already know. We're here because we are on the verge of something the wider world will applaud but our own people will hate. You are being asked to betray your tribe. And I'm being asked to betray mine. That's all. How can we even contemplate doing this? Hm? [chuckles] What? That's the first time you've said we. [chuckles] Well. What? [sighs] You are so defensive. We've spent too much time in graveyards. Aye. It's not that I don't have any regrets. It's -- You're walking on the dead there. Use the path. Show some respect. Do you remember Enniskillen? Do I remember it? No, I, I don't mean that. Of course, you remember it. I -- it's just -- The IRA planted a bomb at a Remembrance Day parade a parade to remember Protestant and Catholic soldiers who fought on the same side against great evil in two World Wars and murdered 11, no, 12 innocent people. I know what happened. But what I'm trying to say is -- Wesley and Bertha Armstrong. Kitchener and Jessie Johnston. William and Agnes Mullan. John Megaw, Georgina Quinton Marie Wilson, Samuel Gault and Edward Armstrong. Ronnie Hill died after being in a coma for 13 years. Yes, I remember Enniskillen. Will you listen to me? It was a mistake, okay? It did irreparable damage to our cause. When it was on the news.. ...they were showing the video. They were showing Gordon Wilson talking about his, his poor daughter under the rubble. And he was saying.. ...that he bore us no ill will. He forgave us. My daughter, she was only a wee tot. She came to me and asked why people had to kill each other. And I said.. ...it's not good to kill anyone but sometimes, if you believe something so strongly... [sobs] And I heard myself sayin' it. I could see in her eyes she was just horrified. But I was trying to justify it. And I realized, uh.. ...I was talking to her as a freedom fighter, not as.. ...not as a father. And I started to think how would I feel if she was under that rubble. If she was the one I had to hold while her life ebbed away? Martin. And that's when I finally understood.. ...that things had to change. We, uh, that the killing had to stop. Martin. Save me your crocodile tears. 12 people were murdered 63 injured including 13 of your precious children yet you've managed to turn it into a tragedy about your daughter's loss of innocence? Really? Really? Why don't you go to those 12 grim houses and tell them your sob story? Tell them that you suffered too. That it caused your side irreparable damage? Unbelievable. Alright, you walk away. That's what you do. You're like the Grand Old Duke of York. You march 'em up to the top of the hill and you march 'em down again. That's what you do with hope you big-headed auld bigot! [sighs] We need to get to the airport. You need to get there. I'll be alright here. Sometimes my bark is worse than my bite. Sometimes? Yeah. Somebody once said that the past is a foreign country that they, they do things differently there. Maybe we have to learn to do things differently. What are you saying? Is he sulking? It looks like he's sulking. He feels cornered. We're still okay for the flight, so we are. - Aren't we? - Oh, yes, sir. [beeps] - Quick as you can, alright? - Yes. [machine beeping] Invalid card. Just give me one minute. I think I.. You'd be first minister. I'd be deputy. First minister. Caesar. Kaiser. - What now? - They won't take my card. The wallet in my back pocket got bent while I was changing the tires. I'm sure if you explained the situation -- No, he says he's not allowed. I do hate to ask, but could I borrow your.. [chuckles] Do you really think any bank would trust me with a credit card, hm? I get so far with the application and then it all goes bad when they see international terrorist. How about you, big man? You step up? I don't use credit cards. Oh, right, I forgot. Moneylenders. Hm. Well, I've no cash on me. I have a plane to catch. This should be interesting. [clears throat] Do you know who I am? Hey, Donald! There's a gentleman here that doesn't know who he is. I'm sorry, I've been waiting my whole life to.. Today, I have been married for exactly 50 years to the most wonderful woman. Tonight, I'm celebratin' with her in Belfast. There's a plane waitin' for me at Edinburgh Airport. To get that plane, my car requires petrol. This driver's credit card is perfectly good and valid. It has been rejected by your machine. You have the power to overrule that machine and process his payment. I would like you to do that. I -- I'm -- I'm afraid I can't without authorization from -- "And Jesus went into the temple of God "and cast out them that sold "and bought in the temple! "He overthrew the tables of the money changers "and the seats of them who sold doves "and said unto them, 'It is written "'my house shall be called the house of prayer "yet ye have made it a den of thieves.' "And the blind and lame came to him in the temple "and he healed them. "And when the chief priests and scribes "saw the wonderful things that he did "and the children crying in the temple "'Hosanna to the son of David' they were sore displeased!" Maybe if I try keyin' in the number it might go through this time. That would be appreciated. Thank you. [machine beeps] Sir, do you mind if I ask you a question? Did you ever actually ever kill anyone yourself? You know, pull the trigger? No. It was a war. People die in wars, on both sides. I just wondered how it felt to have people's deaths on your conscience. Do you mean can I sleep at night? Yes, I sleep at night. I'm sure you do too. Yes, I do. My conscience is clear. Is it really? Never even touched a gun. Well, that may be. But the fact of the matter is you actually started it all in the first place. I mean, if you had joined the civil rights marchers instead of attacking them -- It wasn't about civil rights! Catholics were denied jobs, houses, votes. And I -- I would have supported every man jack of them if that was all it was about. D -- d -- do you not think I, uh I looked across the Atlantic and saw Martin Luther King preaching about civil rights fearless and brave and determined? You, sir, are no -- But they shot that great man. And I'd have been happy for them to shoot me in that cause. Well, that's bollocks. - What about Mandela? - He was another terrorist! Who embraced the peace having been a bomber. Would you refuse to shake his hand as well? Didn't he make a giant leap? Didn't everyone say it was impossible? And look at him now. The world loves him. The difference is he had his people behind him. If you're the leader I think you are your people will follow you too. And if you don't give a damn what I think.. ...let me put it another way. If you're the leader you think you are.. ...your people will follow you, no matter what. Oh, sorry. Mandela, eh? He was the man. Or maybe you're more Che Guevara. - Jesus Christ. - What? I can explain, okay -- What the fuck is this, eh? Nothing, nothing. I swear, sir. Are you supposed to, are you supposed to kill us? - Is that it, huh? - No, no, no, no. God, no. Is that what this bloody pantomime is all about? No, no! It's the opposite, okay? - Look, look. - Easy. I'm here to protect you. Then why are you masquerading -- It is nothing sinister, honestly. They just thought that you might talk more freely if I wasn't a government driver. But they just put me in this bloody Scottish patter. You think I wanna be wearing this? [groans] You Brits, you are so fucking useless. Do you see this, big man? [groans] Honest to God, we -- we should just get on with this peace deal ourselves and -- and cut these jokers out of it altogether! Dr. Paisley? Jesus Christ. Hey, come on, come on. Are you okay? What happened? Are you alright? [groans] Ian, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Ian? [gasping] Uh, pi -- pills, I forgot. - Pills? - Pills. Pills. Where -- where are they? They.. Is that them? - Yeah? - That's it. Okay, okay, I got it, I got it. Come on. How many do you need? - Just one. - Just one? One tablet. Get some water, will you? Quick, water. He'll be okay. What if he dies? Sorry, but what if he -- He won't. Okay. You alright now? Alright. Alright. We'll get you to a hospital. No, no. No. I'm going home. What? Listen, will you wise up? - I -- I -- I'm going home. - No, I -- I -- look, look! You keeled over. What, w -- what if it happens again or -- or somethin' worse? Who do you think will get the blame for that, eh? I'll be lynched. Chance would be a fine thing. I'm grand. Okay, let's see. - How far out are they? - Just over 10 miles. About 15 minutes in current traffic. And what about the plane? Well, it's been on the ground for 40 minutes and getting to the end of its window. The weather's closing in again. Can I ask you somethin'? What is all this, uh so you do, uh, so it is, so I did? What do you mean? Well, you know, the -- the words. So you do, so it is. You add them at the end of a sentence. It's just the way we talk at home, so it is. It -- it -- it's an involuntary thing, so it is. It's almost like we don't expect to be believed, huh? I had lunch today, so I did. I have lunch every day. It's -- it's not unusual, so it isn't. [both chuckling] What? Well, nothing, I was, uh.. I -- I was, I -- I was just thinking about if, um, you imagine some of the most famous men in history had been from Northern Ireland. Neil Armstrong. "That's one small step for a man, so it is." [laughing] Right. "We will fight them on the beaches, so we will." "I had a dream, so I had." First Minister. Caesar. Kaiser. We say never! Never! Never! Pull off the road. Sir? Pull off the road. S -- s -- stop the car. Cutting it pretty fine as it is, but... - Are you okay? - Yes. J -- j -- just stop the car when you can as soon as you can, please! If you can. What are they, what are they doing? What are they.. [thunder rumbling] I'd better go with him. Stained glass martyrs. I saw them when I passed out. They've shaped my life. They've guided me in everything. I stood in defense of Ulster and against the Papish plots. I put myself in the firing line and I thought that that was my sacrifice that that would be my martyrdom. And yet, I was never touched, never harmed. No hand was laid upon me. No assassin's bullet sought me out. I've lain in a hospital bed at death's door and yet he would not let me go. And now, now history contrives to put me here with you! My mortal enemy! And I have to ask myself if -- if he has a reason. Why here? Why you? Why now? Why would he ask me to shake hands with a man like you when there has been such incredible violence? Because that man has changed. How could I ever know that it's not an act? A charade? - A bluff? A ploy? A -- - Listen to me! You've no reason to trust me and I've no reason to trust you but we need a leap of faith and you are all about faith. If you follow your logic if -- if God has put you here with me then he either means you to kiss me or kill me a -- and Thou shalt not kill. Don't quote scriptures at me! What's to say you're not his final test! You're Satan in the Judean desert tempting me with power! Well, I am tempting you with power. Ian, you like to be the big man in the big picture and don't deny it. And you will be that man and for the right reasons. It is all about your martyrs but you, you just have 'em all wrong. What do you know about? Y -- you have been all about protecting your past your -- your -- your precious culture. That's not what they were doing. They weren't interested in the past. They were interested in the future. They were goin' against the grain, not with it. Ian, the true sacrifice is in doing exactly the opposite of what you have promised your people. Accepting that you may burn for it. That's your blessed martyrdom. You are the devil. [instrumental music] Would you like me to give you a minute? Thank you. When did you realize what he was? From the moment he opened his mouth. How did you know? Because I'm not naive. And also because he claimed never to have heard of me. Everyone's heard of me. [laughs] Aye, that's a fact. So.. ...here we are. You are right.. ...about the martyrs. I'm an old man now. Old men can afford to be bold. Oh, what a joy it would be to walk up those steps to see a true man of God sworn in as first minister. But the caveat is I have to do it with you at my side. And we could do this now. I could offer my hand and we could seal the peace. But first, I have to ask you to do something. I know that you would never do this in public. But here, in private.. ...I would like you to apologize. Apologize? I would like you to apologize for all the deaths your people have caused for the ethnic cleansing you've inspired for the innocents your people have murdered for the bombs that have devastated families for the bullets that have killed sons and daughters, fathers and mothers. I want you to say sorry. For that, we get peace. Just say it. Ian Paisley, you have run me round in circles today. And maybe that's what this is all about. You always intended to go one way or the other. But you just wanted your moment. The moment where you had me in a corner knowing that if I went down on bended knee I would always be on bended knee. You just wanted the satisfaction of that. And I could do it. But what would it really mean? Because you know I play a long game. And no matter what we agree here today.. it will change. It will have to change because we are Ireland. We are inevitable. So it should be no skin off my nose if here, in private, I say sorry for all that's gone before and then I get exactly what I came for. But I will not do it. It would be a betrayal of everything I stand for. We had a civil war. And this is our only opportunity for both sides to walk away with heads held high to build something that will last at least for our lifetimes. So I apologize for nothing. That's a true politician. Never apologize. [both laugh] I despise everything you have done, so I do. I despise everything you stand for, so I do. Bloody hell. They've done it. They've bloody done it! [laughs] Well done, sir. Oh, that, uh.. That deer.. ...that was an accident, right? No. We have highly trained wildlife. Hmm. Sir, would you care for a biscuit? Do you have any wee plain ones?
