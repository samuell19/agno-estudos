Pity for the wretched but indulgence for the happy. Film Three LIBERTY, SWEET LIBERTY REPUBLIC OR DEATH! Long live the Revolution! Pop Mabeuf, going to Lamarque's funeral? - Go home. - Why? - There'll be a ruckus. - All right! With lots of gunfire. - And cannons! - All right! You're not going? Sure. Then we'll overthrow Louis Philippe. All right! Long live the Republic! Ma Whosit, I'm borrowing your whatsit. My pistol! Don't push! There's nothing to see for 20 minutes yet. Where's your neighbor, Miss Eponine? Get him down here. - Mr. Marius isn't with you? - No sign of him. Tell him to meet us later on the rue de la Chanvrerie. I'll go find him. What is this? That's the third group of dragoons to go by. Didn't you read the papers? It's General Lamarque's funeral. But why all these dragoons? They expect trouble. He was the Emperor's general and a republican. So it's a bother for the King. - It was in the paper. - The times we live in! First it was cholera, now it's the Republic. - What do you say, greenhorn? - Pretty calm for a riot. Just wait till the cortege reaches Faubourg Saint-Antoine and it starts raining paving stones. Mr. Prefect, we mustn't rely on the war minister. Mr. Soult isn't eager to lend us his troops. Sir, we shall prevail over any rioting. You have four carabineer squadrons on Place Louis XV, the National Guard at the Tuileries, the 6th Dragoons at the Halle aux Vins, the 7th at the Célestins, the 12th Light Cavalry at Place de la Grève and the Bastille. And the artillery at the Louvre. We won't need Mr. Soult's regiments. The disturbances won't last long. I agree. I've informed the King. He arrived at the Tuileries. See to these gentlemen. Just a moment. Police report. Javert. Sir, I've just learned that the students of the ABC Club plan to meet in the Saint-Merri district after the cortege passes the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Keep an eye on them and liaise with Captain Lasalle of the 2nd District. Dumoutier... - Where do we get cartridges? - At the Montreuil toll gate. - The password? - Insurrection. - Got your pistol? - Under my smock. Wait till the cortege passes and things heat up. If he nabs you, punch him and yell, "Long live the Republic!" This won't lower prices none. Business is bad. Even the trash is empty. Folks eat everything and throw nothing away. What do you old frumps know about politics? Your nose is running. Wipe your whiffer. They've reached the Bastille. - Here's Grantaire. - But still no Marius. You coming? Mr. Marius wasn't home. I left the letter. Where can he be? Didn't you ask around? He must be at the funeral like everyone else. The city's abuzz. There was even market talk about barricades in Saint-Merri. So I stocked up on everything I could find, just in case. You see? He'll never come back. He went to fight. I'm scared. I'll go see Mr. Gillenormand. He won't know where he is either. He turned him out. Like you did! If he doesn't get my letter, I've lost him. Toussaint, who did you give the letter to? Mr. Marius's door was unlocked. I left the letter in full view on his table. "Your friends are waiting, rue de la Chanvrerie -- Eponine" See the fellow with the beard? He'll give the signal to open fire. Get that woman and her baby out of the way. Honor to General Lamarque! ARMY OF THE BASTILLES LEAGUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS Did you drop these? Get ready! Not yet! The guardsmen are shopping for furniture. Already? The fun was just starting. Don't come. Sparks will fly. You can't overthrow the government without me. Rue de la Chanvrerie! The situation is out of hand. There's fighting at the Arsenal and Saint-Antoine. Don't lose your head, Mr. Soult. This isn't a revolution. It's a riot, at worst. By tomorrow at the latest, order will be restored. I'll personally visit the boulevards. Yes, two lumps. You, Sire? That's no place for a sovereign. It's the place for a citizen king. Out of the way, boys! REPUBLIC OR DEATH! NO PERFORMANCE TONIGHT - What's going on? - It's a riot! - I'm going home. - Come with us. I hear they took over the bank. There are 600 of them holed up at Saint-Merri church. They even have a cannon on rue Aubry-le-Boucher. The Republic calls out to us Let us learn to vanquish or perish A Frenchman must live for her For her, a Frenchman must die - I have reason to emigrate. - Then let me go. I have to find Marius. I don't want him to die... to die thinking I don't love him anymore. If he loves you, he'll come say good-bye. He's too proud. You drove him away. He won't come again. Cosette, my child... are you sure of your feelings? Yes, Father. Sure you love him above all else? I don't know where he's fighting. Toussaint says the students built a barricade in Saint-Merri. All right. I'll go. You stay here. If I don't return... read this letter. Good-bye, Cosette. Where have you been? You told me to meet you here. I got here five minutes ago. Listen to him! His head's still in the clouds. Wake up. Today there are no more women. There's only the Republic! Who do you think I am? So what if I'm in love? I'm here! Calm down, my friends. Man the barricades. Stand guard at rue Saint-Denis. Password: Insurrection. No bystanders! If you're not with us, clear the street now. My furniture! - Don't worry, Mrs. Huchelot. - The Republic will return them. Hey, don't go. Stay with us. What? Won't lift a finger for your country? My bed! Where will I sleep? At the Tuileries! We can use the sheets to dress wounds. Hurry up. Marius, there's work outside. Mind lending a hand? Keep those stones coming. Hey, how about an omnibus? Great idea! Let's get the omnibus. Strengthen the foundation and bring the stones. End of the line! Get down if you value your life. Republic! Everyone out! Get out or I shoot. Insurrection. It's the end of the world! I know the password: Insurrection. No women. We're going to get killed. The chief won't have it. Get going! Long live the Revolution! Is it your heart or stomach that's bothering you? Hey, you! What are you doing here? You think they could attack our flank? Our friends on rue Aubry have got us covered. Still, you have a point. Give me some men here. Tear up the stones for a small barricade here. Courfeyrac, you're in charge. Some stones over here. And take those casks. More barrels! More stones! More everything! Throw it on! Shove it on! Pile it on! Bring down the house. It's gotta be higher. You loafer. Can't you help out? If you came to bill and coo, go find your turtledove. We don't mind getting our hands dirty. - Leave me alone. - What's that? That's enough. Get out. What is it, Marius? What's on your mind? There are no women, parents or mistresses here. Our cause is all that matters now. If you doubt it, why did you come? Look, Enjolras, my life is yours. I'll prove it soon enough. Just don't ask for anything else. Don't waste ammunition. There's not much. We'll kill a few guardsmen to get their cartridges. And don't shoot until Enjolras gives the word. It's a real holiday, and you look so sad. I warned you about women. - Gavroche! - Coming. You're small. Slip along the house fronts. See what the Guard is up to. Sure, but I want a musket. This thing doesn't cock. - A musket for you? - Why not? I had one in 1830, when we took on Charles X. - Wait till the men are all armed. - If you die, I'll take yours. - Squirt! - Greenhorn! You'll get one if you fulfill your mission. Be careful. As soon as you see something, sing "My Friend Bugeaud" and come back. My nose is running tears O my friend Bugeaud Will do, cap'n. Gentlemen, here's the situation. The crosses indicate what we've recaptured. The circles, what they still occupy. We've flushed the rebels out of the Arsenal, Place Royale, Château d'Eau, Place Maubert, and Place des Victoires. The insurrectional zone has been contained. In the Halles district, there are still 27 barricades. Only four of them are important: rue Maubuée, rue de la Chanvrerie, rue Montdétour, and rue Sainte-Avoye. We'll wait for nightfall before attacking. Within 30 minutes, the troops will surround this quadrilateral. I want a total blackout throughout the district. Residents know we will fire on any lights after 9:00. We'll launch a coordinated attack on all four points at 10:30. By midnight, gentlemen, order should be restored. My nose is running tears O my friend Bugeaud Lend me your gendarmes I'll tell them what I know In their blue coats And feathered shako Make way for the people Cock-a-doodle-doo! It's Gavroche! That's the signal. Here they come! Stations, everyone! - Here they are! My musket! - Wait. After the first volley, you can take your pick. Who goes there? French Revolution! Fire! I'll watch your musket for you. Don't waste gunpowder. Wait till they're in the street. But first, put the flag back. Who will plant the flag? No one? - What're you doing, Pop Mabeuf? - All right! Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! - Get back! - Long live the Republic! I used to know him. We called him Pop Mabeuf. A bit crazy, but quite a fellow. Take him inside. May each of you fight for this dead old man as he would for his own living father. Here they come! Charge! Fire! Watch out! They're coming around the side! Back off! Or I blow up the barricade! - And yourself with it! - Myself with it! Nice work. You drove back the Guard. - But I'm left holding the torch. - Still, it took nerve. We won't last till morning. We're short on ammunition. I'll get some. Watch out for that guy. He looks like a snitch. This is pointless. Send for an eight-pounder. Three shots will do it. Who are you? I've done my duty. I've reported you all. Who are you? - Police. Inspector Javert. - Tie him up. Don't kill him. Don't waste cartridges. We'll deal with him later. - What are you doing? - Filling my basket. - Not afraid of bullets? - If it rains, we'll see. - Get back here. - In a minute. - Not going to kill me now? - We won't forget you. You see him? Gosh! Shooting the dead now? If you're ugly in Nanterre Blame it on Voltaire And stupid in Palaiseau Blame it on Rousseau Good humor is my care Blame it on Voltaire Poverty is my trousseau Blame it on Rousseau The cheeky brat! I'll get him! I fell I know not where Blame it on Voltaire Face down in the gutter's flow Blame it on... Poor kid. He collected at least 400 cartridges. Distribute them. We're in for it now. - Where's my musket? - Here, Mr. Marius. Aiming at that sergeant you can't see? These young artillery officers are well educated. He has a father and mother. He can't be more than 25. - He could be your brother. - He is. And mine too. Let him live. Leave me alone. We have to. Dumont, take command. Get ready. After the first shot, they're sure to attack. Fire! Charge! Spies? None of that! What a shot! But why not just kill them? He must be an eccentric. Charity by musket fire. Who is he? I don't know. A man who saves others. Mr. Marius. That's me. Don't you recognize me? Eponine. How did you get here? Why these clothes? I had to see you. They wouldn't let me through, so I disguised myself. Is it just a hand wound? Here too. Small world... Mr. Fauchelevent. It's all so simple. You exit over a wall and enter around a barricade. Nice work. Anyway, you can rest easy now. You'll probably be the one to execute me. Probably. You thought I was ugly, didn't you? You're here because of me, you know. I wanted you to die too. But when I saw them aiming at you, I put my hand over the barrel. Strange, I wanted to die before you. Listen. I don't want to cheat you. I've had a letter for you in my pocket all day. I kept it. I didn't want you to get it. But you'd be angry later when we met again. We will meet again, won't we? Take your letter. But in return, promise me -- What? - Promise me. - I promise. Promise to kiss my forehead when I'm dead. I'll feel it. You know, Mr. Marius... I think I was a little in love with you. "I spoke to my father. He gives his consent. "Forget his anger. He's expecting you. "Come back quickly. "I love you -- Cosette" Come, sir. - It's too late. - Come. She sent me. I can't now. It will kill her. We're surrounded! They're coming down rue Saint-Denis! They've taken rue Aubry-le-Boucher! Silence! The rue Aubry barricade has fallen. You'll be taken from the rear. Your sacrifice is in vain. Surrender! He makes no vain sacrifice who fights for a cause. All here are ready to die so that our brothers may live free. Liberty... sweet liberty... come fight with those who defend you. Come fight with those who defend you Under our flag, may victory Rush to your manly strains So that in death your enemies Witness your triumph and our glory To arms, citizens Man your battalions March forth, march forth So that their impure blood May drench our furrowed fields Ten men with Grantaire to rue Saint-Denis! Quick, a small barricade here. Your powder keg here. And that witness. Who'll finish off the informer? Me. I'll do it. Good. So, come to finish me off? You're smart when it comes to saving your hide. Dear friends, we're going to die down to the last man. But our deaths will stop nothing. Our example will serve the cause. Others will finish what we've begun. Long live the Republic! Fire when I give the signal. Then I'll blow up the barricade. I love fireworks. Let me set it off. You're the leader. You have to stay to welcome them. If you like. A knife. Good idea. That's more like a convict. - You're free. - What? You're free. I may not come out of here alive. But if I do, and you want to arrest me, I won't resist this time. 7 rue de l'Homme Armé? Get going. I'm warning you, because this time -- Get going. Charge! That's it, my friends. Sell your lives dearly or run for it now. And thank you all. You've served the Republic well. Fire! He shot our artillery officer. Shoot him on the spot. Shoot me. Wait. May I, Enjolras? I doubt you people will mind. Aim! Fire! Sir, he won't escape now. He may lose his way or drown. But if he gets out, we'll nab him. The only other possible exit is at the Arsenal. The grating is open. We have it under watch. You can go. Jean Valjean, there are two carriages waiting. You take the first. You can escort your wounded man home. I'll follow you. What's that? You're not arresting me here, Javert? Thank you. Mr. Marius! Tell Mr. Gillenormand I brought his grandson. He was wounded on the barricades. Sir, come quick. Mr. Marius was wounded on the barricades. What's that? Mr. Marius? Firstly, how dare you yell for your master, scoundrel! - Mr. Marius was wounded. - Wounded? He fought against the King! It was bound to happen. He asked for it. So this is how the bloodsucker returns. He went to get himself killed just to spite me. Why, it's true! And you said nothing. Out of my sight! You're dismissed. - Get a doctor. - Right away. Who are you, sir? Did you bring him home? Did you save him? Consider my house your own, sir. Where was he hurt? Is it serious? Good Lord, why did he do this? Won't you stay, sir? You'll lunch with me. You may be for the Republic too, but we won't talk politics. Marius... my child. It's me, your grandfather. Open your eyes. I forgive everything, if you forgive me too. Marius, my child. I've waited so long for you. Call me father like you used to. I've had your room prepared. In my own room, at my bedside I have your portrait from when you were little. Speak to me, Marius. I don't want you to die. His wound isn't serious. He'll recover soon enough. But his happiness depends on you. What's that? Have this letter delivered to Miss Fauchelevent. Are you Mr. Fauchelevent? My dear sir, I am your devoted servant. I know all about you. My grandson spoke of you at some length. Are you sure you won't stay for lunch? No, thank you. Someone's waiting for me. I'm your prisoner now. I won't try to escape. I just have one favor to ask. I want to stop off at my home. 7 rue de l'Homme Armé. Are you hurt? Why did you spare me last night? Why did you spare me? Why do you stalk poor devils? Each man has his own notion of duty. Just because your duty is to pursue the wretched, doesn't the wretched have the right to save you? Why? I'll wait here. He's a convict, after all. So why don't you arrest him? What's stopping you? What? Hey, watch where you're going! Think you're some kind of a snitch! Excuse me. They found him drowned? Was it an accident? A suicide, sir. They found a note on him. "I am no longer blameless. I let a convict escape. "I am unworthy of the police. I must disappear." Incredible. Javert. He was a good element. Yes, but a bit blinkered. - We need men like that. - Maybe so. At last, I'm Madame You. It's so sad that he couldn't be here. Yes, it upsets me too. But you know we have to respect his wishes. He's always been a bit strange. Pour me some champagne. You won't be spared my sermon. This morning you heard the priest. This evening you'll hear the grandfather. I raise my glass to beauty, youth, and love. Ah, fun-loving virtue! How charming women are in our times. But admire first of all our adorable little fairy in her ballroom gown. With a slip of my slippered feet, I shall now open the ball with a cachucha. Yes, ladies, a cachucha. That's my idea of a revolution. And I'm going to dance with Mrs. Marius Pontmercy without your permission, you scalawag. Music, maestro! Mr. Pontmercy may not be up yet. I'll go see. We retired late. They danced till 4:00. Don't tell him it's me. Tell him it's someone who'd like to speak to him in private. I want to surprise him. It's you, Father? And that idiot Basque acted so mysterious. Feeling better? You're early. It's only 12:30. Cosette is still asleep. Have a seat. Mr. Pontmercy, it was best that I not attend your wedding. I stayed away as long as I could. I never left Paris. I made up that trip so as not to render your marriage contract void. To avoid having to sign, even as a witness. I came to tell you that I'm an ex-convict. What? I'm an ex-convict. Meaning what? That I was sentenced to forced labor, and that even now I'm a fugitive from justice. What did you do to deserve prison? What did I do? I stole a loaf of bread. And how do you know Cosette? Ten years ago I didn't even know she existed. I saw her mother die. I was able to save the child from some scoundrels, the Thénardiers. I don't think you can call that a good deed. But if it was, let's say I did it, and put it down as an attenuating circumstance. Today... Cosette leaves my life. Fine. Why this confession? Who's forcing you? You could have kept your secret. What's forcing me to tell you? A very curious thing: my conscience. Obviously, remaining silent would have been easier. But there were two things I could never do: break the bonds of the heart that kept me here, and silence that voice that whispers to me when I'm alone. Mr. Pontmercy, I'm going to leave you now. You offered me a place in your family. You didn't know who I was. I have no family. I'm a convict. Will you allow me to say good-bye to Cosette? Well, really! What is this? "Say good-bye to Cosette"? What's all this about? You're leaving again? What have I done? No, child, no. Don't. Don't. What's all this about? He's scaring me. Why won't you kiss me? Yes, Father, why won't you kiss her? What have we done to you? Your absence changes nothing. We're still your children. Our hearts remain the same. Why won't you take Cosette in your arms? You heard him. You've no right to be so cruel. You seem angry at me for being so happy. My darling child, your happiness... has been the sole purpose of my life. That's the father I know. Hold me tight... like you used to. What's the matter? You're white as a sheet. It's nothing. My wound may have reopened. And you said nothing. You see? I had to say good-bye. Don't cry. It's nothing to die. It's terrible not to live or to go astray. Come closer. I want you to have the two silver candlesticks that Monseigneur Myriel gave me. I lit them myself. I hope... that he who gave them to me... is satisfied with me. I did the best I could. Children, I'm a poor man. Don't forget. I want to be buried in the first plot of earth that you find. That is my wish. A headstone. No name. If you should visit from time to time... I'd be very happy. Do you want a priest, sir? I have one. Farewell, children. Be happy. Live in peace. God is just. It is man... who sometimes... is unjust. Subtitles by Lenny Borger
