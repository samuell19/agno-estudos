In the Song Dynasty, there was an imperial doctor surnamed Liu. He was the second child in the family. So, people called him Second Liu. As he was mediocre in his medical skills, he wasn't quite respected at work. One day, the emperor suddenly contracted a strange disease. None of the doctors knew how to treat it. Only Second Liu had an idea. There was a kind of bedbug in a remote village. If the emperor ate it, he'd be cured. But he was worried that no one would believe him. The days passed and the emperor was dying. Second Liu bit the bullet and revealed the method. The imperial court decided to give it a try. He took a team to the village, but all the bedbugs in the village had been bought by the same person. In order to cure the emperor, they had to spend a lot of money to buy all the bedbugs from this person. After the emperor ate the bedbugs, he got well indeed. From then on, Second Liu's career took off in ways unimaginable to anyone. It's too hot. I can't stand it. I'm leaving. Mr Liu, please take a little more time to hear my story. In the Song Dynasty, there was also a businessman, Zhong Xiaowu. One day, he passed by a remote village and found a kind of bedbug there. Its venom could deadly poison. The antidote to this poison lies in eating the whole bug. He had the villagers collect these bedbugs and paid one copper coin for each. Soon, all the bugs in the village were caught. After that, he got in touch with the imperial doctor, Second Liu. Soon after that, Second Liu put poison in the emperor's food. And very soon, the court sent a team to the village and bought 10,000 bedbugs from Zhong Xiaowu at the price of ten pieces of silver each. In the end, Zhong Xiaowu and Second Liu split that money equally between the two of them. It's a nice story. I like it. If I were Second Liu and you were Zhong Xiaowu, what's the bedbug then? It's Stock 700225, Dami Technology. Its price is pretty low right now. I'll take three months to buy it in chunks before releasing some exhilarating news such as a success in developing nanoparticles. I'll raise the price to ten times that of the current price. And then you'll announce that you're acquiring this company. Use your company's money to buy my shares. The net profit will be 800 million. You take 70 percent while I take the rest. Is it safe? I'll use about 100 accounts to process it. Of all the nice places, why must we meet here? It's to assure you that I have nowhere to hide any cameras. Mr Tang Wanyuan is my partner. I manipulate the stock prices and handle the transactions. He's in charge of the liaison matters. Hello? Let me ask you one last time. Was it you who took my money? Mentor, I'd advise you to stop running. You'd better turn yourself in. Hello? I'm fine. You need to go see a doctor. You can't go on like this. I told you I'm fine. I thought you weren't coming today. Was the last price increase five years ago? It can't be helped. My mother-in-law wants me to buy a house. After a man gets married, everything costs money. - Here you go. - Okay. Overall, there are clear peripheral negative factors on the international side, plunging the market into pessimism. The plummeting of the refineries' prices is forcing key markets in Eastern China to fall at a time when the market price is already near its all-time low. The market is expected to stabilise subsequently. Now, let's move on to domestic news. Last week on the last trading day, the stock price of Dami Technology hit a new high. It's generally predicted that the price will remain strong tomorrow. The biggest shareholder of Dami Technology is now Huayou Pharmaceuticals. What's the significance of a state-owned enterprise like Huayou Pharmaceuticals in aggressively acquiring Dami Technology? Let's hear it from Liu Wenshi, the president of Huayou Pharmaceuticals. Huayou Pharmaceuticals has a long history of decades. Our focus has always been on public health. With the acquisition of Dami Technology, we'll be developing a series of products to better promote public health. So, this acquisition is the old meeting the new. How much did you get from this acquisition? Even the wonton shop is raising its price. It's 20 yuan per bowl now. Six months ago, this stock was trash at three yuan per share. Lately, the trading volume has been increasing. Were you buying out the stock? Had Guo followed my lead in the market, he'd be so much better off now. Was it you? I'm doing it for our family. Look around this house. Nothing comes out of thin air. You said you wanted a good life. Let's get a divorce. I can give up the house and the car. All I want is half the shares of Tengyuan Capital. If we get divorced, who's going to eat your leftover wontons? I'll get a lawyer to handle it soon. I'll be staying at a hotel for a few days. After you think it through, we can make it official any time. It's sold to Mr Tang Wanyuan from Tengyuan Capital. Our next item is the I-Do Tower diamond ring. We'll start at one million yuan. Great, we have a first bidder. One million. Two million. Thank you to the lady on the phone. Three million. Four million, thank you. Five million. Great. Thank you, Miss. Six million. - Seven million. - Seven million. Eight million. Nine million. Ten million. 11 million. 12 million. I wonder if the gentleman is up for the challenge. 12 million going once. 12 million going twice. - 12 million... - 20 million. 20 million. This gentleman is most impressive. Is anyone else interested? 20 million going once. 20 million going twice. It's sold at 20 million yuan. Why did you have to fight with me? You were fighting with me instead. Fine, I'll stop forcing you to marry me. It's not necessary for chicken lovers to buy a whole chicken farm. Watch your language! Give me your lipstick. This represents our investors. They'll pour loads of dirty money into the 2,000 stores of Zhuang's Gold nationwide. If the total amount is two billion, each store gets one million. No merchandise will be offered. The money is simply pooled together and invested into Tengyuan Capital where it's processed and wired overseas as consulting fees and goes back to the investors as legitimate money. So, I'm - your new money-laundering channel. - Yes. A number that can't be turned into cash is just a number. Why didn't you discuss with me before working with Zhuang Yi? I'm the CEO. I don't need a second opinion when I make decisions. Listen. I put you in that position. I can certainly kick you out. Is that a threat? Mr Tang, is everything all right? Get out. Get out. Zhu Nan, do you know Wei Simeng wants to divorce me? It's because you've changed and she's not happy. Do you think you know her better than I do? Do you think she'll be happier with you? Drive the car back to the office. Simeng. Simeng. Simeng. I have a gift for you. Simeng. Simeng. Wei Simeng. Financial News It's 9.30am. Welcome to the morning financial news. First, the latest news. Zhong Xiaonian, the CEO of Tengyuan Capital, who was just named the Financial Person of the Year, posted a Weibo entry at 9.00am today with a picture of himself fishing in Alaska. Zhong said in the post that he'd resign from the post of CEO of Tengyuan Capital. Our journalist tried to interview him about his resignation and departure from the country, but his phone has been unreachable. We'll keep you posted on future updates. Now, let's take a look at the US stocks. Stock price manipulation is a felony. It's ten years' imprisonment at least. You have only two options. You either do it or leave this company. This money has to be laundered. Secretary Sun, this money is worth ten years in prison. When are you getting a divorce? If I divorce her, she'll get my money. Let her have it. You can live off mine. Someone asked about Zeng Guangwen again. What should we do? He's dead. There's nothing they can dig up. - Hello. - Hello, Mr Zhong. Who are you? What do you want? One is faced with many choices in life. When options A and B are presented at the same time, the one you choose may alter the course of your entire life. What you've accomplished so far is a result of making the right choice again and again. In philosophy, it's called determinism. Wait, who exactly are you? I have all your dirty secrets. For the next five days starting from today, at 9.30am when the market opens, I'll give you a multiple-choice question. There are only two options to each question and you have to choose one of them. If you don't make a decision, I'll assume that you've chosen both. Do you understand the rules of the game? I don't want to play any games. Open the door now. Did you hear me? You have only three minutes to consider it. A: Announce your divorce B: Expose your tax evasions Did Wei Simeng put you up to this? Is she behind this? Wei Simeng, I have neither the interest nor the mood for games now. And I certainly don't want to choose A or B. Hello? A: Announce your divorce B: Expose your tax evasions - I bought the things you want. - Thank you. Xiaonian said you wanted to divorce him. I can't watch him degenerate further. I need to stay away for a while. You should've done this long ago. He didn't give you the life you wanted. In that case, why can't you make a different choice? I have to go. I'll come visit you again. Good afternoon. Welcome to the financial news. Zhong Xiaonian who's on vacation in America just announced on Weibo that he's in love with Zhuang Yi, the president of Zhuang's Jewellery, and he wishes to marry her. Meanwhile, we received an anonymous email that accused Zhong Xiaonian of huge amounts in tax evasion, with a detailed financial statement enclosed. We've forwarded the email to the relevant department. Are Zhong Xiaonian's resignation and departure from the country related to this? We'll keep you posted. Wei Simeng, we're not divorced yet. How does it benefit you if I get ruined? Mr Zhong, I hope this teaches you a lesson that no secrets remain hidden forever. You made the choice to get your hands dirty. Now is the time to pay the price. I don't care who's behind all this. Whatever he's paying you, I'll double that. So, everything always comes down to money. You've let me down. Cut the crap and name your price. What's the meaning of this? Hello? President Zhuang... It's said online since your father died, Zhuang's Gold has been struggling on the verge of bankruptcy. President Zhuang... If Zhong Xiaonian's tax evasion is true, will you still marry him? I heard it's a marriage of convenience. Are you the one he's waiting for in Alaska? Is this a marriage of convenience? Can you make this? Yes, but it's a little expensive. Money isn't the issue here. How long will it take? Five hours? Five minutes. Mr Tang, the fastest will be tomorrow morning. All right. Make sure the retina works. Wei Simeng, hello. This is a news flash about Zhong Xiaonian's resignation. At about 6.00pm, a woman slit her wrist in a hotel room and was rescued. As of now, she's in a critical condition and remains unconscious. According to eye witnesses, she's Wei Simeng, Zhong Xiaonian's wife. With Zhong Xiaonian suddenly leaving the country and his wife attempting suicide, the situation is becoming more mysterious than ever. It's impossible. It's impossible. Why would my wife try to kill herself? Tell me. Tell me. Who exactly are you? Who exactly are you? Mr Tang... Does Wei Simeng's suicide have anything to do with the divorce? Is Tengyuan Capital involved in tax evasion? - Hello. - Please read Question Two. A: Reveal stock price manipulation B: Expose Zhu Nan as a trade spy B. I choose B. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Welcome to today's Agricultural Finances. My name is Tian Yu. As the saying goes, live on what the locality provides. Today, I want to share with you the various resources of the mountain. Can someone hear me talking on the walkie-talkie? Hello? Is anyone there? Can you hear me? Switch the channel, pal. You're on the wrong frequency. Please listen to me. I'm at 8 Lake Villa. I've been kidnapped. - Come and rescue me. - Hey, kid. Did your dad lock you in? I'm not joking. Listen to me. I've really been kidnapped. I'm Zhong Xiaonian. Have you heard of Zhong Xiaonian? Zhong Xiaonian. You can search the name online. Financial Person of the Year. You'll be able to find it. I'm a financial reporter. How can you prove you're Zhong Xiaonian? You're a financial reporter? That's great. Listen, I'm really Zhong Xiaonian. I swear I'm telling you the truth. Hello? Don't turn it off. Hello? Why are the things not in the safe? Mr Tang, if you want to know where the key is, just turn on the television. Zhong Xiaonian posted a few photos from when he was in secondary school. The man next to him in the photos is Zhu Nan, the assistant of Tang Wanyuan, the Vice-President of Tengyuan Capital. Their relationship as ex-classmates has never been made public. Posted in the same Weibo entry are text messages between Zhong Xiaonian and Zhu Nan, referring to trade secrets of Tang Wanyuan. Zhu Nan has committed the crime of breaching business secrets. Investigations are being conducted on this. You took the key. It doesn't take a whole day to copy the retina. You lied to me. You betrayed me and tried to steal from me. That money is mine. Did you hear me? It's mine. You rascal! You're messing with the wrong man. Here's the key. I can also get you the bank account passcode. Hello. Please give me the passcode to the account. You want Wei Simeng. I've given her to you. You shouldn't have taken what belongs to Mr Tang. I'm begging you. Give me the passcode. It could save my life. All right, switch it to video call. Mr Zhong, here's an additional question. It may help you get out sooner. What happened to Zhu Nan? Answer the question now. Remain silent - Account password - Please tell me the account passcode. Tell me what happened to Zhu Nan. What did you do to him? Tell me. Who wants to kill you? Time's almost up. I suppose you know what the passcode means. 19300830. 19300830. 19300830. 19300830. Who are you? What do you want? You and Xiaonian have drifted so far apart and yet you still share a bed every day. Doesn't that bother you? Doesn't Zhong Xiaonian want to marry you? Where's your man now then? That's between the two of us. Is that so? Let me tell you where he is. Zhong Xiaonian has been kidnapped. The kidnapper gave me two options. Option A, let Zhong Xiaonian die. As his sole successor, I can get everything he owns. Option B, reveal the passcode to his private account. But I'm not even aware that there's a private account. The kidnapper said that if I were willing to die for this scoundrel, he'd spare his life. I can die for him. Can you? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Help! Tengyuan Reading the flash drive Why didn't the key work? I got hold of the real key on the first day. What Zhu Nan had was a dummy I placed in the safe. I have the passcode now. If it were you, what would you do? I paid for the... Balance: Five yuan Listen to me. I know where I am now. I'm locked up in a mountain cave or air-raid shelter. Just look for any air-raid shelter near you and you can save me. The walkie-talkie has a range of three kilometres. We should be very close to each other. Hello, I know you can hear me. Can you help me? Hello? You're such a nuisance. Why can't you just leave me alone? Fine, you don't have to save me. I just want to know if there's any news about Wei Simeng. Can you tell me how she's doing now? You're really into your character. What does she have to do with you? As usual, choose option A or B. Admit you killed Ex-CEO, Zeng Guangwen Expose money-laundering of Tengyuan Capital Answer me when you're ready. I didn't kill anyone. You can't plant this on me. I've told you I make the rules. You have no right to question them. I have one question for you as well. A, lock me up here and torture me further. B, let me go and I'll give you 100 million. Which one do you choose? If you can give me 100 million now, I'll set you free right away. But is there that much money left in your private account? Without money, you're nobody. Are all successful people as pathetic as you? B: Reveal the whereabouts of the money I choose A. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? If you hear this, please answer me. Are you still there? Listen, I can prove I'm Zhong Xiaonian now. - Did you hear me? - Go on. I told you someone has kidnapped me and blackmailed me into exposing all the trading secrets. This isn't important. Listen. Turn on the news now. What you'll see is a report on me killing Zeng Guangwen. Zhong Xiaonian just posted an alarming message on his Weibo. He admitted to killing Zeng Guangwen, the former CEO of Tengyuan Capital. To usurp the position of Zeng Guangwen, Zhong Xiaonian forged incriminating evidence and framed Zeng Guangwen. After Zeng Guangwen absconded, it was said that he jumped off a building because his reputation was ruined. But in fact, he was murdered by Zhong Xiaonian. Zeng Guangwen, founder of Tengyuan Capital, was the chairman of Tengyuan Capital from 1991 to 2008. After Zhong Xiaonian joined Tengyuan, he soon became favoured by Zeng Guangwen. Within a few years, he rose from a nobody to one of the pillars of - Tengyuan Capital. - Hello? - Hello. - It looks like you really are Zhong Xiaonian. I'm calling the police. No, don't call the police. I'm already a suspect now. If you call the police, I'll be doomed. You have to find a way to get me out so that I can clear my name. I can help you get out, but on one condition. Name your price. I want an extensive video interview with you. You'll tell me how you rose to success and what you've been through for the past few days. I need to have access to you 24 hours a day. Okay, it's a deal. What you saw was the scene of the accident. The deceased, Zhong Xiaonian, was the CEO of Tengyuan Capital. He was named Financial Person of the Year last year. In the past two years when the overall market is in a downturn... The dead can't be brought back to life. My condolences to you. Drop your act. Laugh if you want. You're the one who should be laughing. Not only can you inherit his shares, you can inherit the billions in his private account too. How do you know about the private account? You did it. Didn't you? Calm down. Think about the baby. Think about the baby. Xiaonian is gone. You're his only legal successor. So, you'll transfer the company shares to me without asking for anything in return. I'll take over the company. You have one day to chew over it. Don't make me bring out the big guns. There was an accident on the West Hill Highway yesterday. The vehicle involved in the accident belongs to Tengyuan Capital. According to the first forensic report, the deceased was Mr Zhong Xiaonian. As of now, I've taken over the management of Tengyuan Capital. As for the negative messages which appeared on Mr Zhong Xiaonian's Weibo for the past few days, I believe they were posted by an imposter. Hello? Did you watch the news? It looks like a lot of people want you dead. I know what Tang Wanyuan is up to. I have to get out today. But if you want to get out fast, I'll have to call the police. No, don't call the police. I just came up with an idea. It's a little dangerous. But I have to give it a shot. - Wait for my signal. - What signal is it? Just wait. What exactly is your signal? My signal is smoke. Look for the smoke. I set up a fire inside the air-raid shelter. We're running out of time. Hurry up. Zhong Xiaonian. Zhong Xiaonian, are you there? Answer me, Zhong Xiaonian. Zhong Xiaonian, where are you? Zhong Xiaonian. It's me. I'm glad to know you're all right. Where are you? I'll pick you up at the hospital. No. This place is full of reporters. You won't be able to get in. Let's meet somewhere else. I'll try to get out. Let's meet at home at 7.00pm. All right. - Let's go to the police. - I can't. You almost lost your life and you still want to keep doing this? I have two choices right now. Either I change my name, move to another country and keep my head down for the rest of my life or I turn myself in and end up in jail so that you'll only see me behind bars. How am I supposed to choose? There's a third option. Find the mastermind, get all the evidence and my life back. How could you still be so delusional? Have you forgotten how Zeng Guangwen died? He had it coming. If he hadn't done those things, I would've had no dirt on him. I'm so ashamed of you. What about the dirt on you? Did those people make it all up? Why is it that you're never wrong and it's always someone else's fault? You should've been dead to me long ago. Who's that? He got me out and I promised him an interview. He could come in handy in many ways. It's not safe here. Let's go somewhere else. You've been renting it all this while? I bought it when I could afford it. I'm reluctant to discard the things here. I have it cleaned once a month. This is your room for now. It's been more than ten years. Old Zhang is still teaching those kids to play the violin. It's like a dream. It's as if nothing ever happened and we're back here. Back then, you were always asking when we could have a good life. What I meant by a good life wasn't one built with money. Do you still remember this? Of course. I was all about work back then and would always forget about the wontons you bought for me until late at night. When I opened this thermos, the soup would still be warm, but the wontons would all be slushy. I insisted on eating them, but you'd always dump them and buy a new bowl for me. Xiaonian. Why don't we dump out the past? We can leave this place and start all over again. Not yet. Is money more important than your life? It's not about money. I can promise to have an honest life with you, but there's someone out there, trying to take everything from me. He has all the dirt on me. If he exposes me, I'll be doomed. To find out who it was that locked me up, you need to help me. I've been thinking. He must've had a lot of crew to build that thing down there. Let's go visit some construction sites. We'll find something. That's too slow. Follow me. Why did he make a copy of your house? To open my safe, both my retina information and a number code are required. And I change the passcode every day. The mastermind knows that every morning after I get up, the first thing I do is to open the safe and work on my account. That's why he made a copy of my house to fool me for those five minutes to get my retina information and the number code. Why did you bring me here then? In that house, the only thing that's custom-made is the double bed because Simeng has a bad back. Once we find out who made a copy of that bed, we'll get the mastermind. Look for this design in the past six months. - You search this way. - All right. Look. Is this the one? Yes. Order information Order information: Zeng Guangwen So, Zeng Guangwen isn't dead? It's impossible. I oversaw the burial personally. Can you tell me more then? Back then, Wanyuan and I worked under Zeng Guangwen. Wanyuan wanted to get the evidence of Zeng Guangwen manipulating the stock market and laundering money so that we could kick him out. And that was what we did. After the scandal, Zeng Guangwen fled. The investors never stopped looking for him. Apart from fearing that he'd divulge their identities, they also wanted to have their money back. You took the money. Through underground banks abroad, the money was withdrawn slowly and came back to my account as legitimate income. But what I didn't know back then was that those investors were driving Zeng Guangwen crazy. If I'd known that last call was made from a rooftop, if I'd given the money back, none of that would've happened. It's pointless to say that now. Clean up the place. We're going to Brim Lane. Wait here in case something happens. 51 Brim Lane 52 Brim Lane Stop him. Back the car. Back up. Next, more news about Tengyuan Capital. At around 6.00pm yesterday, Wei Simeng who was hospitalised left the hospital disguised as a nurse. She had her back to me. I thought she was asleep and was going to wake her up. But the moment I touched her, I blacked out and was unconscious. When I came round, I realised she knocked me out with a defibrillator. According to the hospital staff, Wei Simeng was very weak when she was admitted. She was detected to be two months pregnant. Is her sudden and reckless departure related to the recent scandal about Tengyuan Capital? We'll keep you posted. Let's eat. You don't eat coriander? Have you never eaten coriander? You never tell me anything. I had to find out that I'm going to be a father from the news. What's there to tell? You'll never know what I did for you. Why did you slit your wrist? That's not what I'm talking about. What are you talking about then? How would I know if you don't tell me? Do you know what my score was when I enrolled in School of Journalism? I don't. 688. You never told me. My dream was to become a war correspondent. From undergraduate to graduate school, I was the top of my class in every course. After I graduated, I was working for the best newspaper. Yet, I quit my position as the Deputy Editor of News to become a financial reporter. Do you know the reason? You never told me. It was to get to know you, to know what you were interested in. Isn't that how you like it? Did I give you the ten best years of my life for the money? I did it to be a part of your world and to be with you. But as I started to get a picture of all those things you did, a dark abyss opened up in front of me. I'd rather give up my job and wait for you at home because I'd only know that you were safe when I saw you walk through the door. Private number - Hello. - Hello, Mr Zhong. How does it feel to be free again? You must be disappointed without the money. We agreed the game would last five days. This isn't the end yet. I can give you the money, but you must return the evidence to me. I'll mail the evidence to you. Wire me the money. Such an important transaction must be made in person. Let's meet tonight at ten on the Railway Bridge in the outskirts. Why are we meeting so late? I need time to get that money ready. And I want the video on Zhu Nan's murder. Otherwise, I can't get the money. Don't play any tricks. Otherwise, I'll make you live in hell. I got it. Why can't you wire him the money? It's too dangerous for you to go there. It's impossible to wire it to him. Where's your money anyway? When you said you wanted a divorce, I was afraid a lawyer might get involved and find out about my private account. So, I transferred all the money to Zhuang Yi and hoped to get it out through her means. But there's no way she'll give it up now. I asked for a divorce so that I can get my shares back and make it impossible for you to do anything illegal with that company. I know. You're utterly disappointed in me. But if we want to start over again, I have to get the evidence. Without money, how are you going to get the evidence? If you agree to meet with two persons, money won't be an issue. I didn't expect you to approach me of your own accord. What you want is money. Why don't we play it another way? What do you mean? This company is Zhong Xiaonian's lifelong effort. I don't want to give it up. So, I'd like to buy out all your shares. All right. 35 yuan per share. Tell him it's daylight robbery. The stock price closed at 20 today. This is daylight robbery. You're just like those aunties haggling over prices at a marketplace. Don't say anything. Just tell him you'll use the closing price tomorrow. I don't expect you to accept the price I name. Instead of bickering over it, why don't we just take the closing price tomorrow as the final price? You need to take care of your health instead of running around like this. God forbids that anything happens to the baby. I'm here to discuss business, not to bicker with you. - Business? - I want you to buy out Tengyuan Capital. Tang Wanyuan has sold me the 35 percent of shares that he owned. And with the shares of Zhong Xiaonian, I own all the shares of Tengyuan Capital. I've made a deal with Tang Wanyuan to buy his shares at the closing price tomorrow and I can sell them to you at the closing price today, which is 20 yuan per share. The profit in between would certainly not escape you. May I ask why you're doing this? Don't answer. Get up and leave. If you know what Tang Wanyuan is doing right now, you'll know how much this contract is worth. There are a lot of higher bidders. Hang up the phone first. I'll call you back. Wei Simeng. I heard that Tang Wanyuan has been borrowing money. The stock price tomorrow will surely be higher. - Hello. - Call me President Wang. Hello, President Wang. I'll offer you 21 yuan per share. 24 yuan per share is a fair price. - I'm on my way. - 25 yuan per share. 25 yuan and I'll take the whole package. The cash she has is my illegal money. Don't take that. Ask her to pay in gold. When can you pay? Let's sign the contract first and give me a week to prepare the money. Sorry, I can't wait that long. But I can accept the same amount in gold. I need all of you to work overtime today. This US stock needs to go up quickly. Otherwise, he'll kill me. Zhuang Yi Hello. Here's another piece of breaking news about Tengyuan Capital. The current CEO, Tang Wanyuan, is suspected of murder. The victim was his assistant, Zhu Nan. After Tang Wanyuan killed Zhu Nan, he disguised the crime scene as an accident and bribed the forensics officers into passing the deceased as Zhong Xiaonian. Tang Wanyuan is being wanted by the police. Affected by this disturbing news, Tengyuan Acquisitions, a US stock controlled by Tengyuan Capital, went through a panic-driven undersell after the market opened, resulting in a drastic drop in its price. Zhong Xiaonian remains missing. Where's your stuff? It's in the car. Why should I believe you? Why should I believe you didn't make a copy? The game has rules. As long as the money is good, I promise you there won't be another copy in the whole world. Personnel data List of beneficiaries Are you out of your mind? How did you find me? You're really scheming. You ruined the company and then framed me for it. And now, you even want to take every penny from Zhuang Yi and me. But Zhuang Yi is a smart girl. She planted a GPS device on the van. She said that if I could get the gold back, she'd give me half of it. Tang, calm down. He conned both of us. If you want the money, take it. It's all here. I was the second in command when Zeng Guangwen was in charge. I asked you to help me get rid of him. But you rode roughshod over me. I'm still second in command. Nobody knows you're alive anyway. I called the police. I wanted them to arrest him. I didn't know you were coming. You have the money. Run now. Tang Wanyuan, you've been surrounded. Drop your weapon. Don't try anything stupid. Every road has been blocked. Stop trying to flee. Please cooperate with us. You really gave him the keys? You really think I'm that dumb? I gave him the keys to the office. Help me get ready. I'm going to hold a press conference. It's all over. The press conference is tomorrow. Will you come with me? I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait for you at home. Can we not get a divorce? Good morning, everyone. I'm Zhong Xiaonian and I'm still alive. I believe that you've all heard quite a lot about me on the news for the past few days. Some even said I died in a car accident. But it was clearly a hoax. Since a lot of the news was quite negative, I feel the need to clarify through a press conference. Where had you been for the past few days? Why didn't you come forward when the negative news first broke out? For the past few days, I'd been confined illegally. I was in dire circumstances. Luckily, I escaped at the first chance. Mr Zhong, the relevant department has received proof of your tax evasion. Is that forged as well? I welcome the relevant department to run a check on me. If there are any problems, I'm willing to pay my dues and even a huge fine. Is it also untrue you killed Zeng Guangwen? If I were a murderer, could I still be standing here? Rumour has it that you sold all your shares to Zhuang Yi. Is that true? Did you sleep with her? All I can tell you is that my wife, Wei Simeng, and I have a very good relationship. She's not at this press conference because she's pregnant. That's all I shall say on that. All right, it's getting late. I'm sure you all have plans. I won't hold you here any longer. Thank you very much. Private Number. A: Leave now B: The game continues Private number: Game upgraded You have 90 minutes. Take off your suit He's back... He's removing his clothes. Private number: Take off your pants Mr Zhong, what are you doing? Why are you removing your clothes? Private number: Take off your underwear Private number: Keep it on Take out what's under the podium Private number: Plaza. Trash can Mr Zhong, where are you going? Mr Zhong... Mr Zhong, what are you looking for? Please tell us what you're doing. What are you doing, Mr Zhong? Mr Zhong, please explain. A: A journalist's life. B: Your wife's life Please explain. Hello, 110 Command Centre. Someone was shot at Central Plaza. Come now. - Hello, help. - 110 Command Centre. Someone was shot. There's blood everywhere. Zhong Xiaonian shot someone. Come to Central Plaza now. I'm sure the shooter is Zhong Xiaonian. Stay calm. We'll be right there. Are you heading towards this destination? Affected by the news that the CEO of Tengyuan Capital, Tang Wanyuan, is suspected of murder, the price of Tengyuan Acquisitions took a nosedive yesterday, setting the record for the biggest drop range in a single day. When the market closed, its price was at US$5 per share. It's you. Why are you doing this? I'm not the one behind all this. I'm here to help you get away. I don't care who you are. Where's my wife? Where's she? I've lost everything. A: Leave with Zhuang Yi. B: Code to safe Give it to me... Go to the roof. Take the stairs Don't go. Come back. You can't save her. You'll both die. Get out of my way. Open it. People will die for money indeed. Simeng. Why are you so foolish? - I have a bomb on me. - Don't move. I have one on me as well. Stay still. Have you forgotten how Zeng Guangwen died? He had it coming. I wouldn't have dirt on him if he was innocent. You took the money. Through underground banks abroad, the money was withdrawn slowly and came back to my account as legitimate income.. Is money more important than your life? He has all the dirt on me. If he exposes me, I'll be doomed. How am I supposed to choose? Mr Zhong, hello. My real name is Zeng Yu. Zeng Guangwen was my father. No, he wasn't just my father. He was my hero. He knew he was breaking the law, so he made sure no one knew about my mother and me. Did you think he killed himself to escape the law? It's because those investors threatened him with our lives. That was why he jumped. After that, my mother lost her mind. Now, I want you to go through the same. You each have a bomb on you. When the time's up, both will go off at the same time. But if you detonate one of them before that, the other one won't go off. The detonators are on your vest. The left one is yours and the right one is your wife's. Do you understand? Don't move... Leave me behind. Just leave me. Stay still, Simeng. Stay still. Take off the vest and go now. I'm not going. - Go. - Stay still... Go now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Simeng. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done all those evil things. I don't know how it all ended up like this. All I wanted was to give you a good life. I'm so sorry... I know there are no second chances, but if I could do it all over again, I'd choose to live an ordinary life with you. If there's a next life, I'll still marry you. I don't want a next life. Xiaonian. Give birth to the baby and raise him well. Come back. Xiaonian, come back. US Supermodel, Chrissy Teigen Now, let's take a look at European stocks. The Greek stock market rose for the 12th consecutive day yesterday. It's been the longest trend since 1991. It's outperformed the generally flat European stock markets. Your wontons are ready. I'm leaving. I've been meaning to ask you this. Why do your wontons always taste the same? Maybe it's because I've stayed the same. Today, the verdicts were passed at the same time for the high-profile acquisition case of Huayou Pharmaceuticals and the murder case by Tang Wanyuan. The ex-president of Huayou Pharmaceuticals, Liu Wenshi, was sentenced to life. I've spent my life serving the people. I'm not guilty. I feel wronged. Tang Wanyuan was sentenced to death. Tang Wanyuan wanted your money, while Zhu Nan wanted your wife. So, I used them separately. Tang Wanyuan paid for the construction, while Zhu Nan got me the blueprint. Who was that young man whom Wanyuan pushed off the bridge? I hired him to conceal my identity. I was planning to take your money and then your life. But since you already jumped, let's consider the old Zhong Xiaonian dead. Time's up. I hope that when I see you again, you'll still be the same. I'm leaving. I'll come back to visit you. The high-profile case of Zhong Xiaonian manipulating stock prices, laundering money and disturbing social order will be tried in public today. As Zhong Xiaonian turned himself in and he confessed all criminal activities, the court will show some leniency in his sentence. But Zhong Xiaonian remains silent about the reason behind his running half-naked and shooting with an imitation gun. Let us walk you through how Zhong Xiaonian caused public disorder. He's opened his parachute... Next is a piece of news on charity. A charity organisation received an anonymous donation of a staggering two billion yuan today. The head of the organisation told our reporter that they'd wanted to find out who the mysterious donor was, but after some discussion, they decided to respect the donor's wish to make the donation while remaining anonymous. It's delicious. I never asked you why you like their wontons in particular. That was the first thing you treated me to. Back then, you said you wanted to give me the best. And I thought to myself. So, this was what the best tasted like.
