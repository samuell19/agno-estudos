[radio chatter] Excuse me. Whereabouts is the wake? Oh, you just go around there and you turn right at the top. Who's it for? Oh, some girl. I never saw anything in the papers. Yeah, well, it's not news anymore, that kind of thing. Poor kid. Hi, Jan. I haven't seen you two together for donkey's years. Listen, we're just gonna get a drink. Yeah. See you later. How can people bear it? I don't suppose they can. Did you ever to imagine her voice? Look, if Lily has died, if anything happened to her, I'd try to be thankful that she'd already had a good crack at life. I'll try to think about that. I have to get her a new case for the French horn. What's that worths? Heaps. A bomb. [scoffs] Still. It's important, isn't it? You don't think she's at risk do you? Of course not. You know she's not. But they're all at risk, aren't they? maybe you can't tell until it's too late. Louise is all right. What about her friend though, the sexy one? Kelly's dropped out of sight. Is she alright? I don't know. I don't think so. Come on, Janet. Jimmy. I loved what you said about her in the church. We hadn't seen her for a long time. Everybody's sad. Everybody's grieving. But when people come up to you who've got a daughter... Jimmy, I'm sorry I didn't go over the fence with you that day. The Springbox... I'll see you about ten then. OK... bye. Louise. Matthew's here to see you. He's downstairs. How's school? Pretty foul. been to the ball room a few times lately. Hate the ball room. What could we do is walk around pretend they're half dead in this sort of foul dance. Guess who I saw down there. Who? Kelly. What she look like? Anyone want a cup of tea? Yes, please... She sent you her love. Thanks. How did she look? Alright. I mean come on. What? Well, what was she wearing, for example? I didn't really notice. She give you her address? She's not leaving anywhere. Where does she's sleep? They're squatting in an old fruit shop. She said it was really nice inside. Who's they? She was with a bloke. What sort of bloke. Quite old, about 20. He was wearing a singlet. They're on acid. Said they were. What do people still do acid? Well, I think they mix it with other things. Bourbon or serepax or something. Who are we talking about? Kelly. Kelly? Is Kelly all right? I think so. Is she thin? What does skin look like? Well did you look at her eyes? Oh, no, don't embarrass me. I didn't notice. Sorry. I think she had a bruise on her face about here. Should I put a record on? Nick Kershaw? That's not mine, it's mum's. [routy boys chattering outside] Oh, she's such a bitch. She never rings up. She said she was coming to a concert on my birthday and she never turned up. I bought her a ticket and everything. I paid for that ticket. Maybe she had a reason. And she took my flower press and never brought it back. Well, surely neither is likely to be needing a flower press. Oh, that's not the point. Nanny gave it to me. It's mine that stupid mole. Louise! What a way to talk. I don't care. Anyway, she's hardly a person anymore. For yourself, is it? No, why? If it's a present, I can gift wrap it. Ah, thanks. It's for my mother. Her birthday. Somebody has to pick up the load. Kids have to be looked after. Well, look at Kelly. What's her mother thinking? How can she just let her go? They let her go. She'll probably end up like that poor kid we be buried this morning. Dropped in the gutter and just left there all night. I feel responsible for Kelly. Oh, don't be silly, Janet. I do. I should have done something. What? What could you do? I don't know. Something. Could've gone on and talk to her parents. Probably wouldn't have helped, but at least I could have tried. Tried what? Look. If they want to leave, you can't stop them. Kelly's such a clever girl. She's not clever enough, evidently. You know, I thought of taking her on myself at one stage. Oh, that'd be ridiculous, Janet, should drive you bananas. That's what Phillips said. That's what everybody said. Well, someone ought to have done something. Don't you think? What do you think? I used to think of giving Molly to you. To anyone. Do you remember when they were little. Kind of like little fairy creatures. Sort of sexless? Do you remember when Wally used to ring up Louise and play his violin to her over the phone? He busted the market now... Makes a fortune. So, cynical. Is that someone at the door? Haven't you given him a key yet? Hi. Hi, Al. Bye. See you later. I'll get you a glass. OK. [kids] Oh, look at that girl's hairdo! Knock, knock. Kevin! What? Who's there? Amanda. Amanda who? Amanda fix your television. Hi, Kelly! Hi. I can't stay long, I just came to say happy birthday. Hello, stranger. Hello. Sit down. Do you want some soup? Oh, no, thanks. You go ahead, doll, I'll have a smoke. How come you never ringed? Chris doesn't know where you've been. I have been a bit worried, Kelly. Where are you living? Down at Bondi. Is it a house or flat? It's a flat. Sort of a flat. Well, does everyone have their own room? To sleep in? Course they bloody do! What do you think? Come on, it's a fair question. Oh, get stuffed I was talking to- Listen, I won't have you talking to Pris like that? I mean, what's your game? Just- just what exactly are you trying to prove, eh? I mean, is this what you call looking after yourself? Jesus Christ, you look like a bloody smack freak. Brought you a present mom. Have you any idea what you're doing to your mum? I'll come again, okay? I'll ring next time. To my dear friend, Lousie. The first thing I should say is sorry for not contacting you sooner. For the last couple of months I've just needed a total break which I've had and feel much better for it. I've been living in Bondi, walking distance from the beach. Up until now, I spent my time starving and totally broke. I had to wait about seven or eight weeks for the dole. It was pretty hard, but I survived. I've just moved into a flat with some other people. The flat is really good with big rooms. The rent is one hundred fifty dollars monthly, which is not too bad, especially when dad's paying for it. So far, so good, I'm not a junkie or a prostitute. Life should be slightly easier now that I've got a place to call home. I feel a lot happier. For a while I seemed to be a manic depressive. I've been in love for about three months. That sounds typically like me. His name is Panky. I was living with him for about two and a half months then things deteriorated, but hoping things will pick up again. At the moment I'm waiting for postman to bring a check from my father, as once again I don't have any money. I've been sick for about two weeks, probably from bad diet, etc. I was on antibiotics, etc. But I'm over that now. I lost my cat, she was with me one day and just disappeared. My new address is on the envelope. Come visit me anytime. I haven't seen my family at all. I've sorted of been holding my breath. Not sure how they'll react. But, I'm going there tonight, which is mom's birthday. Maybe I'll get a good meal for once. Give my love to Soula, Julie, Justine, Janet, Dag, and Matthew. Take care and please write back. I'll save the rest when I see you. Love, Kelly. P.S. Sorry I didn't make it to your birthday, something came up. P.P.S. Recognize the paper? Ah, faster grey with blue edging. He's got one sister. Of course not! I'm not a ma, you know. Oh, Kelly! Well, he's tall. Sort of, sort of blonde hair. Yeah, short at the sides. On the train. Hurry up, Louise. I have to go in a minute. Oh, hours every night. And guess what? We don't have sewing. We have theory of naval craft. Would you get off that bloody phone? I have to hang up. She wants to use it. Okay? Yeah. Bye! Kelly sends you her love! Oh, there's my dad. Awkward isn't it? It's alright. Matthew this is my father. Hi. Matthew. Hi mate. Nice to meet you. Great. You live around here? Yeah, just around the corner. It looks like we're visiting with some girl. Dad... Great minds think alike. Bye. Malcolm is so stingy. He won't even pay for her to have singing lessons. Said she has to work in the chemist after school if she wants something special. Special! I think that's disgusting. He's a bastard. He's foul. Doesn't her mother ever stick up for her? She's scared of him, too. She's pathetic. That's why he shouldn't have the right to ruin everything. Not even her real father. Hi. Hi. Hi, Jim. Did Phillip bring Louis? No, he didn't. Oh. Good. Who's Philip? [blows horn] This man was so horrible with his toes that he had to grow a beard like this to hide, how horrible they were. Dad. Do you think anyone will mistake us for girlfriend and boyfriend? I don't know. What do you think? Turn that light off now. In a minute. Lousie! My God! I haven't seen you for ages! I haven't seen you for ages! You're so beautiful! Oh, Messy, this is my best friend, Kelly. Hi. Hi. She'd be going to City Girls if it wasn't for her bloody dick head stepfather. It's OK, King Street. Anyway, my be leaving school after my birthday. Leaving school? Yeah. Derek might be able to line me up a job where he works. Come on. Aren't we going to your place? Want something to eat? Yeah, I'm starving. We have drinks. Want a drink? Thanks, yeah. Total bob. Really? Yeah. It looks excellent. It's all shaved in the back and everything. It's really good. She used to have curly hair, didn't she? Yes, she had it straightened. It's really good. Thanks. Oh, I remember that. That was so funny. He fell down the drain! I remember that. God, that was so much fun that day. Oh, there's that grass. Oh, look how you're cute! Oh, this one at down the beach. That's me and you there! Yuck! Thanks! Oh, these have plates. Oh, no. Oh, look, you can tell you've got your yours in there. Smile with your lips closed. Oh, ghastly. Louise still has to wear hers every night. Don't you Louise? Oh, wow! I haven't scene that for ages. Thought you said Matthew was a spark. Well, he is. Reckon he's a bit of a poof. Oh, he's not. You can always tell. Why did you have to say that to him about my plate? Well, it's true. Well, you didn't have to say it in public. Oh, who cares. He's probably got one himself. A big pink one with one bust tooth right in the front. Where's Janet? At work. Let's have a little glass of vodka before she gets back. I have to start my homework. Oh, how boring. We should be allowed to go to City Girls. Why? Well, I just think it would have been better. [radio] Knowledge they created. Witnesses and juries, for example, forget things. Miss hear things, misread things. Marvelous clouds. Shh! I'm listening. [radio] Influenced the way they give evidence and make decisions. The school rang up today. They said you'd missed two days already this week. Well, where do you go? Pris! There are no towels in here. Take him a towel Kelly, please. You take him one. You're his slave, not me. Kelly! He wouldn't wait on you why do you wait on him? Come on! Can I have a towel please? Get your own towel like everybody else does. Oh, you're a real pain in the ass, Kelly. Don't worry, I won't be here much longer. I'm going to live with Dad. Don't be stupid. He doesn't want your loafing around his flat. Does so! And he's going to pay for me to have singing lessons. [scoffs] [sings to herself] [TV chatter] What can this chap-a-loo for you do? Haven't you been to sleep yet? I was thinking. What about? I was thinking about how they got plasticine. You'll be taught in the morning. Hey, Kelly, do you like making things? No. Used to. I love making things and sometimes stayt up all night thinking about the things I'm going to make. You probably don't stay awake the whole night. Yes, I do. To breakfast time? Yep! I bet you drop off around 3am. No, I bet you I don't. [TV chatter]. Then my bedroom door burst open and out came malcolm in his underpants yelling, What is it? A dog? A dog? Now, I'll need two rabbits and some mustard for the sauce. Rabbits? I hate rabbits. I refuse to eat it. It's exactly like chicken. Anyway, you're not invited, it's adults only. Oh, thanks a lot. What am I supposed to do? Thrown out of my own house. It's where I live just so you can entertain your daggy boyfriend. You can go see your boyfriend. Go and watch TV at his place. Matthew is not my boyfriend. Go on Louise. Be a sport. You can go over to Kelly's. Can't, don't want to. Aren't you two friends anymore? Yeah, but it's not the same. Oh, yeah. Mm! Does anyone take a moral position on rabbit? Not me. I love it. [phone ringing]. Damn. I'll back in a minute. We won't wait. Hello? Oh, hello, Kelly. No, she's not home. Can I take a message. She's gone to Matthew's for tea. Can I get her to call you when she gets in? Where are you ringing from? I'm at my dad's. No, he's here he's out in the back with the other guys staying here. Can you hear them? They're having a drink. You hear that tooting? Every time a car goes past they wave and whistle itand see if they can make them toot. I might be coming to live here actually. No, not that much. He eats out a lot. Listen, Kelly, I've got some people here. I'll have to go. Do you want to come over? You can wait for Louise here. Oh, no, thanks, Janet. I'll be okay here. I've got a video to watch. Hostesses on Heat. No, I was only joking. Listen, give my love to Lou. I think she's got shit to me a bit at the moment. Hey, Kel. Kel. Off the ohone will you? I'm expecting a call. Well, if you ever need a place to stay... That's up to her... Alright, go ahead. Who was it? Kelly. Is Kelly all right? No. It's great cabbage, isn't it? Good. Hope it's not cold. I really love to but now my daughter's here. Yeah, okay. Alright, alright. I'm on my way. Hey, Kel. I gotta pop out for a while, okay? Okay. You'll be alright here? Yeah. That's my shirt. See you in the morning, sweet heart? Okay. Night. Thanks again for pudding. Alright. You down for poker? I don't know the rules. Not very good at cards. I'll teach you. We could play poor economy. It's just about getting rich and making money. Rich, good. I'm going to be rich. Gotta appoint a banker first. You can be banker. You look like a banker. I look like a banker? Why don't you relax a bit? You look so tense. Loosen your tie or something. I feel much better. Good. Well, there's just there's two circuits inside and outside, advertising squares, company squares, and basically just got to get as many as you can. I'll let you have straight, because I'm on a diet. Is that you, Charlie? No. It's me. Is he back yet? No. You alright? Yeah, I'm alright? You want to come in here for a minute? What's wrong? Nothing. Come here. Kelly. I'm sorry, look... Don't go. Kelly, is that you? There was this man, he came around the corner he was all barred up. He was what? He was just... Hi, Kelly! Where are you going? No where. Oh, mum, can Kelly stay the night? Of course she can. It's 4 o'clock in the morning, for God's sake. Go on up to my bed, I'll make us a cup of tea. Do you still sleep with her? I was waiting her and dropped off. Where've you been? Just out. Where's Janet going to sleep? She can have my bed. You better put your plate in if you tend to make it straight. Good night. Good night. I can hear your heart beating. Have you been running? Shh. Just go to sleep. Night. Did you go to the INXS concert? No, I hate them. Why? They're excellent! Oh, come on, they're so commercial! Matthew! Oh, Kel- look Kelly, Shabooh Shoobah, I admit was a good album. Yeah, okay. It's a bit- but it's still good. My God, look at this. Eighty nine dollars for the blazer, that's bloody highway robbery. Why are school close so expensive? This blazers eighty nine dollars? I'd understand if it had some lining, but it's so thin. She won't even stay warm enough. Yes, well, if it was lined, madam, it wouldn't be a blazer. If it had a lining, it'd be a jacket. Where's the fitting room? Straight over to the left. Does it fit? It's the right length. Don't be silly, you have to try the next size bigger, here. But I like this one. The waist is up under your armpits. Oh, it's daggy. I look like a dag in it. Look, stop mucking around and try it on. I'm waiting for you to go outside. What do you think about that? Oh, it's all right. So, do you think you're finished with this one? Yeah. And this one? Yeah. Good I'll take them with me. You got it on? That's miles better, you'll grow into them. It's foul! You think I'm going out in public street wearing these? Oh, for God's sake, Louise, I'll take up the hiem when we get home. Hey, look who's here. Kel? Shut up! What? I don't want them to see my uniform. Hi, Janet! Hiya. Oh, wow, I love your shirt. It's gorgeous. What have you been buying? Show me! They're awful. They're disgusting. Oh, you poor thing. Imagine you have to clomp along the street in those. Listen to this. Other obsolete slang terms are fantabulous, drongo, tropo, dag, cool cat- Shut up. You're so loud. What's the matter? I hate it when you talk to me like that. Sorry. Mom? Can Kelly stay the night? I suppose so... [singing] Heigh! Ho! Nobody's home. Meat nor drink nor money have I none. But still I will be happy. Heigh! Ho! Nobody's home. Meat nor drink nor money have I none. But still I will be happy. Heigh! Ho! Nobody's home. Meat nor drink nor money have I none. But still I will be happy. Heigh! Ho! Where do you want to sit? Hope beer's here tonight... Hi! Do you want to go out for a swim? Yeah... oh it's beautiful. Oh, don't! It'll go all flat! Pass me up and down. Oh, no, I'd better go with Renato and them. Back in a minute. Oh, hi. Hi. [routy chatter] No! Get him! Throw him in! Hi, Louise. Hello, Ollie. Isn't Kelly here? She's over there. Oh... I was wondering if you wanted to busk the market. I don't think the French horn and violin would go all that well together. I'd drown you out. We could take it in turns. I make a lot of money. How much? I made about thirteen bucks last Saturday. What sort of stuff do you play? Oh, you know, shit. That's what they like to here. Be a Clown. Don't Cry For Me Argentina. I don't know any of those songs. See you, Louise. Bye. You just dumped me. Sorry. Should've come over. I was dying for a smoke. You look like a dickhead when you smoke. The way you hang your head back. I know you, Kelly. You can't impress me. That's absolutely starving. What are you doing here? I thought you were going out with Philip. He didn't feel like going. There's some spaghetti here you want to set up? Oh we've already ate, no thanks. What did you have? We went to lunch elsewhere. You don't have any money. We conned a free meal. You conned it? No, Kelly knows the waiter. We had rigatoni. One with two forks. Well, I've obviously been wasting my time then. Is it okay If I use the phone? Go ahead. Do you want chopped nuts on yours? Yes, please. All right. Yeah. it's okay. Strawberry topping? Yes, please!.. Yeah, okay. See you soon. Bye. This is Louise's house. Oh, Sam this is Louise. Hi. Make yourself comfortable. [TV chatter] Who's that in there? Oh, Kelly and Sam. Who's Sam? I think he's a hairdresser. Well, where did he spring from? She met him at the bars. He knows Renato. What do we do now? I'm furious. Water the pot plants... Janet do you mind about Sam? You didn't even introduce me. Would you rather we left? Kelly I just wish you'd asked first. I'm sorry. We'll go. I said turn. Not that way! The other way. Don't do that it ruins the whole hem of the thing. Why are you being so mean to me? I haven't done anything wrong! I think my ex husband is going to turn up with his new lady. Do you live far? God yeah. Miles away. We're betting I'll only have to travel three hours a day. Will those late comers in the back please move quickly to their seats. We'd like to start our occasions on time at City Girls high school? Oh God, it's him. . Isn't she incredible? ... And welcome and congratulations to all those girls who were successful in our entrance examinations. We know that the high standards we've set and maintained at City Girls will be an inspiration to our incoming students. We have a long and very special tradition that City Girls. Our... Do you think the first one will surge in and stand up there? They ain't going to see us. ... Privilege entails a corresponding responsibility. This is a demanding school. We ask a great deal of our girls and we expect the support of parents as well. Now, this may not suit everyone. If you don't like it here, you don't have to stay. Now, our Madrigal Group will entertain you with an early 16th century song entitled Philomena's Lost Love. [singing] Did you see the French teacher... Fill it up. Thanks man. ... Her clothes, were fantastic. What's the matter, Malcolm? If I'd known that it was gonna be anything like that, I wouldn't have wanted her sitting for the exam. Like what? Oh, come on. It's reactionary. It's elitist. I mean, you heard her. The way she talked down to us, I really take offense at being spoken to like that. You won't have to. You're not the one going there! I like the school, Malcolm. I did. I really liked it and so did Louise. And you must admit the singing was very good. But this is the end of the twentieth century, right? Well, what are they doing still singing that kind of stuff? I mean, the kids should be playing rock n roll. Anyway, a concert that doesn't give you any idea of the kind of teaching that they do. They should have an open day so you can walk around... That would be really boring. And what's so really interesting about City Girls? You heard what she said they make you work! Kids... Kids shouldn't be made to work. They should be encouraged to work at their own pace. Malcolm, I really, really want to go. I want to be with Louise. Louise... I'll think about it. Please? We'll talk about it later, alright? So when you going to ask her? After tea. [TV chatter] You can have a Christmas tree this year? Yep. No. I'm not buying one. I hate them. It's just another rock. We can get one of those- Anyway, they drop their needles everywhere. You can get one of those plastic ones from service station. They're only seven dollars. Malcolm says we're not going to give each other presents this year. That's disgusting. How mean? Don't tou think so mum? People are entitled to their own ideas. It's because of the third world. Starving people. Ask her. [singing] Gonna have a party, do you want to come? If you want to come, you better ask your mum. Mum can Kelly stay? I suppose so. But be in bed by 10. 10:30. 10:15. Do you think she'll let us? She doesn't like parties so much, does she? She'll let us if we promise to clean up the mess afterwards. Anyway, when you change schools at our age you have to have some kind of celebration. How about this green stuff? Yeah. They're all lez's at City Girls! Charming. What's all the fuss about? They only live around the corner. They'll see each other every day. Is it alright? Does it look wecoming? It's beautiful, girls. What about the tree? It's pathetic. It's fine. The sausage rolls! What time is it? Oh, about six. That's the time we said, nobody's here. What if no one comes? Should we start ringing them up? They'll come. No one ever arrives at a party early. It's uncool. Knock. Hi Soula! Hi. Hi! You're the first one. Hi, Kel. Soula. I'll be back at eleven. I don't want to hang around. You be ready. My mum made it. Come in! I'm just going for a walk. I'll be back in an hour, alright? [girls giggling] They got it set up like a dentist waiting room. I felt like first bursting into tears. Oh, thank God we're old. Wally isn't talking to you? No, I made him wear a helmet. It's long since to have something as simple as a bad dream so you can comfort them. [radio chatter] Don't smoke in the house, okay? Now we can't smoke. You're like your mother. Can't drink, can't smoke. You invited us here! No I didn't. What's going on? What's happening? We invited them and they sort of broke in. They took the champagne out of the fridge. I couldn't stop them. She's a slag! [routy jeering] I'm going to lock, the front door. The very least, I think, owe me apology, Renato. Thanks a lot. You're a slut. It's hopeless with boys. It's a waste of time to invite them. You're just hopeless. Oh, no. He's crying. Aw... He's got a big white hankie in his hand. She's getting out of the car. Now in her own. Oh, she's locking the door. God, he's trying to open it. Ah! She's letting him in the passenger side. Is there going to be violence? She's leaving him. He loves her. She's breaking his heart. God, she's putting her head against the steering wheel. He's getting out. She's driving off, they're waving to each other! [laughing] Oh, he's going back to his own car. He's lighting a cigarette. He isn't starting the motor he's just sitting there. Just as well. He stays in there there'll be carnage on the rise. Time heals mate! Shush, he'll hear you. He's got his windows rolled up. [music blasting] I'm in here. Mum! Malcolm changed his mind. What about? He won't let Kelly go! He won't let me go to City Girls. But you passed exams. You got it in. He doesn't care about that. He's changed his mind! He hated the orientation night, now he won't let her go. Can't you do something? What can I do? Talk to him. Go see him. He'll listen to you. No, he won't. He doesn't even know me. It doesn't matter! Kelly, surely your mother says- Please mum! Can't you help us? Look, sweetheart, I really don't see how I can. If I stick my nose in this he'll just tell me it's none of my business. It's so unfair. They drank champagne with us when we passed exam. I hate him. Hi. Why didn't you go around the back? Merry Christmas. Try to get it on my toe. Hi. Hi Kelly! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Here's some presents for you here. Did you get any at home? Mum gave me a beach towel. I can't stay for long. They're waiting outside. We're going to nana's. Did you to talk to him? Oh, it's no use. He feels that and starts fighting with mum. This is for you Kelly. Thank you. Oh, wow they're beautiful. Aren't we gorgeous? Thanks. Here are yours. I better go. That's exactly what I said, but then you find you got a smart kid on your hands. What do you do? And then what happens to them? They come out bored. They're bored shitless. Merry Christmas. How are you? Heading away? Anything for a quiet life. Merry Christmas. Why did you have to give her my earrings? Alright, girls. Pens down. Leave your papers folded with your names and schools clearly marked on the outside. You may go... Sorry dear, you've got to finish now. [group chattering] [Soula crying] Did you finish? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. What episode did you do? I did the most unusual person I've ever met. Who'd you write about? You actually. Oh, you did not you dope! Did you? Yeah. Gorgeous. That was the fifth time I've seen it. When I read the book at grandmas I cried so much, my pillow was all wet. I went [mock cries]. How do they stand those corsets? [imitating a southern gentleman] Why Scarlet, everybody knows you got the littlest waste in the entire county. It's pretty racist, though. All blacks were servants. Yeah, but that how it was back in those days. Would you contemplate a smoked oyster on a biscuit? What was the war actually about? I skipped those beats. North and south wasn't it? Whether they should be allowed to have slavery? Those bastards. 12:45am Rear Window. Oh, great. It's got Grace Kelly in it. Top. Just do it. No one's coming. Well, turn around, can't you? Jason! Will you please keep up? That was close. He nearly saw me. When are you going to start rebelling? Don't you think I rebel enough? That's what teenagers are supposed to do, aren't they? Teenagers... Don't embarrass me. You talk like a magazine. Would you say Kelly was rebelling? She's more into boys and sex than you are isn't she? Shut up. Do I have to talk about this? But you will tell me when you start getting your period, won't ya? Oh, shut up, mum. You're so revolting. If you really want to know something, Kelly's on the pill. Does she actually do it? How would I know? You're so awful. Stick your nose into everyone's business. [scoffs] Well that's what the pill's for, isn't it? I wish I hadn't told you. I wish I'd never told you anything. Don't you dare tell. We'll have to do it again now Beth's driving. Read out what we got so far. To the editor. We are two young girls who do not wish to die. Our lives are before us. We want to study to learn about the world. But every time we open a newspaper... We read about the arms race. [singing opera to himself] Mr. Reagan and Mr... What's the Russian president called? Haven't they a new one? We should know that. Thinking we should say about the nuclear stuff at the beginning. We are two young girls who do not wish to die. Our lives are before us. We want to study, to learn about the world. But every time we open a newspaper... Wait for me. Come here quick! You know mouth to mouth? But she spewed! You alright? Piss off! S'cuse me. Maybe she was a drunk. She might have been a drug addict. Do they spew? She didn't smell like a drunk. I'm never going to take drugs. I'm never going to smoke. It's disgusting. Thanks, mum. Sorry. Isn't that Kelly? Of course not! She should be in mess by now. She'll be waiting for me. See ya. Bye! To my dearest friend Louise. I will tell you the truth, no, I've never sent a letter that long. My God, all these pages, how did you manage it? I'll try to make this long, but I don't know exactly how long. Well you're about to find out. I started this in art. I was so bored without you and now it's massively worse. Where are you? I hope you are not sick and being rushed to hospital in the middle of the night and no one told me. I'll buy the sweetest flowers and put them by your bedside. Lilies, roses, whatever thy heart could this desire? Today is the day we get told whether or not we get into City Girls. I can't wait. If I don't get in I'll kill myself, I swear. I think we should each make a promise that if the other doesn't get in, the other won't go either. Just couldn't bear another four years in this hellhole without you. take marks off for that? What if we got in but they didn't put us in the same class? There are endless things to worry about, so I'm just going to keep my fingers crossed and hold my breath. This pen keeps conking out. Now tried about six or seven pens to find one that works. This pen is from the picture shop... Remember we all got one last year and went on that town excursion with Mr. Pipalco? Oh, I've got to buy some material for my sewing class. Only cut out the pattern and already into the second half of term. Paulette just walked by with a brolly, it's meant to be Spring! Renato is bending over. He looks so cute in his little shorts. Quite showing. I've come to the conclusion he'd make a very good guy, but still I don't think it'd have anything to do with men. Oh well, only time will tell. We watched a video last night called Tess. I've just finished reading the book so I was really quite pleased to see it. Notice I'm making my writing smaller so you get more value? When are you going out to Pelican Beach? We should get it organized so that I can be up there when you are. I hope it's after Christmas. What do you reckon? I can just tell though I'm going to get very, very burned. Hey, geez... You'd go brown in one day. You must be at wog. Sorry, only joking. God, I was scared before I went to family planning clinic. But it was okay after all. Fairly impersonal. I'm a fairly routine case so I had no reason to be astounded. Oh, gosh, Louise, I really, really, really, really want to live with my daddy. Must sound funny me saying daddy instead of dad. I just don't like dad. What's more, it's too common. I just don't know if he'd want me and if I'll be allowed to. I really need change of environment. Gosh you wouldn't believe how much I want to have hit him. At times I've had him up the eyeballs. But I really, really, really, really want to live with him. If he says yes the only barrier is Malcolm. He doesn't like daddy, so I think he'll probably give me the third degree, but I'm still hoping. It's so good to have my own room, my own space. It's something I've never had. I've been trying to work out the color scheme, but I just can't decide on the color to paint the cabinet or to have the curtains. I hate to think about it in case it doesn't happen, but I can't stop... Lots of love from your best and most faithful friend, Kelly. P.S. Now you're not the only one to have written a six page letter, so na na na. [doorbell] Shh, Malcolm's asleep. You know, he's got the flu. What's all the fuss about? The girls passes the exam. They got into City Girls High! Oh yeah? Congratulations I'll just be a minute. We're the only ones! No one else passed, not even Soula! Not even Justine, not even Julie! Okay, you ready? Here we go. What do we drink to? To the girls. To our clever girls. Yahoo! [girls choir singing]
