You're here already?- - I came up... So... Finally you're here, bro! Ah, welcome! Thank you.- - Come in. Come. Come in. Just a second. Sure. Boss, may I come in? Come. Sit. Please don't worry about it. You've already done a lot for me. Thanks a lot, I'll manage it. Sure?- - Absolutely! So, by the way... I found a mess room for you. I'll text you the details. First, you need to reach Girish Ghosh's house. Then walk straight and take a right from there. There you can see a... a hotel. It's quite famous. 'Nilachal'. Sir, which way is Hotel Nilachal? Little ahead, on the left. On the left?- - Go straight. On your left.- - Thank you. So, RJ Srijan... In a bit you life is about to rock! Anybody here? Hello? Anybody home? Anybody home? Come in. Oh no! What do you want here? If the horse walks another step, your minister is off. Shut up... you basket! My minisiter will go off?! Is it? Actually, I was looking for a... Mess hosue as in a place to stay in... Mr...- - D'cousta! Mr. D'cousta... Who told you there's a mess here? What's your name? Riju. Riju Banerjee. No mess room on rent here. Get going now! Get out! Get out! Go to the house accross the road! Err... Which way outside the gate?- - Get lost! Not one more word! Uncle! Only you can save me! What!- - I am completely new here! I don't know anything here. I got wrong information. But... But you can...- - What! 'Uncle'?- - You're like a father to me... 'Like a father'? In fact you are my father now!- - There's one room under the stairs. It's been closed for ages now. I'll manage! No issue at all! Wait. Surrender comes from within. You're more complex Than a riddle Clearer than hunger A hundred ways to while away time And a burden in the heart You come dressed as a dream To devour me often Hence I warn you It's better to hate me It's better... Wow! Bonolata (Wild flower) Too coy for you? You are... 'Jhinti'. Tipper tapper... rain drops. So, from now on... Along with the... cockroaches.. And tons of lizards... and a couple of pigeons... you too will stay with me? Oops! I'm very sorry, I didn't see you coming! Excuse me... What the... It's time we spoke... I mean... Won't it be better if we spoke clearly? Since we are living together... Then we both need to have a... Hey... I did not try to mean... anything bad, okay? Just... Just friendship. Absolutely... clear freindship. Just like that song... Let me sing to you. I'll get the guitar... No... for today... I'll sing without it. The time flies away, tick-tock As we face each other Tick Tick Tick tick tick tick... Something... Something... You get it? Something like this... Just a... friendship. Have your tea, it's getting cold! You probably don't like tea, right? Okay. Done. From tomorrow... Capuccino... Or American... Alright? Jhinti... So the deal is final, right? As in... We're friends, right? I'm very alone. Alone in this entire city. Without you... Excuse me. Just a second. My name is Riju. Can I know your name? Where do you stay? I need to talk to you. The damp marks on my wall... And that girl... they look exactly the same! This is serious. I tried to speak to that girl yesterday. She simply ignored me. It's an insult! But I am chatting up with the damp mark everyday. But the original girl... isn't paying me attention! But the damp mark isn't avoiding me. Now what should I do? Both are... equally important to me, Srijan. Rubbish. Get a servicing from the whore-house, you'll be fine. Listen, enough is enough, okay?! Now I will have to tell you! And you will have to listen to it. I might sound... rude, but... What should I do? This is my first time! Yes! This... This is the very first time for me. Yes, I admit... I admit I had someone back in Durgapore too. Her name was... Lakshmi Ramanathan. Now give me a break! I know what you are thinking. 90% South Indian women... aren't fair skinned. Lakshmi was an exception. I used to like her. But not like this. This was not what I felt. It is like... 24x7 I think of you, you and only you! I love you, Jhinti. Are you're my first love. Please try and understand. I love you! Where are you? Look at me... waiting for you early in the morning on a holiday. How selfish of you! Is today a holiday for you at all? Or... Are you in any problem? See.. I can't understand a thing... Everyday... at least I get to see you once. I planned to speak to you today. Can't take this anymore. If only I could know if you will come at all... Uncle... I want to talk to you... What is it? Nothing. Listen! This can't go on! What do you think? You think you can play with me like this? I'm losing all my control now. Jhinti, you've to talk to me now. Please don't remain quiet anymore. Don't keep mum! Reply, Jhinti! Stop this to and fro! Stop, Jhinti! Stop playing with me! Please stay with me, Jhinti. I can't go on like this. Grandpa... Hey, Grandpa... The girl who entered that house, what's her name? Does she live in this house? Grandpa, can't you hear me?- - You swine! Letching at the girls in the neighbourhood! I'll give one thrashing! Rubbish! Hey, Riju! Hey! What is going on? Riju, you'll miss the show! What the hell! What are you looking for? Strange! Boss! Erm... Madhabilata Basu... 'Madhabilata' D'cousta! Mr. D'cousta! Surrender comes from within! Jhinti, Madhabilata! Jhinti, Madhabalata! Jhinti... Madhabilata... Jhinti, Madhabilata... Jhinti, Madhabilata... Jhinti... Madhabilata... Jhinti... Madhabilata... What do think of me? Hey! Think I am an idiot? You've ruined my life! Playing with me, aren't you? I used to sing for you! You think I am mad? Am I? What do you think? You bitch! Proud of your beauty eh? Now look at yourself! Look at you! See how ugly you look now! Keyatala road! Fast! Please driver faster! Hey... what about the money? What has happened here? What the crowd for? Today, at dawn... at around 5:50 am... The girl who used live in that house, she went for a jog. She was hit by a car! Hey, get him! Kill him! He is responsible for this! Kill him! He is to be blamed! He killed my daughter! Beat him to death! You swine!
