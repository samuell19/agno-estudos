Mountain lions, one of North America's most powerful predators, are making their presence known again after decades of hunting brought them to near extinction. A number of recent clashes with humans is causing concern about the return of the large cats. Reporter Penelope Clark went out with the team of wildlife biologist from Stanford University tracking mountain lions in northern California. When Brendan Dugan, a field biologist with Stanford University, tracks mountain lions, his first step is to unleash two specially trained bluetick coonhounds. Cougars prowl almost invisibly around here but if tracking conditions are good-- like after a light snowfall or something-- and a dog picks up a fresh scent, can usually find one. After a few hours, the dogs discover a cat and give chase. There we go. They got them caught up in a tree up there, see? He's way up there, but they're actually able to jump about 20 feet. Hey, put your seat belt on. I know. I was just picking this up. Dugan removes a rifle from his pack and loads it in the dark to save the lion. It's my bible. He aims. Five, four, three, two, one. The dart hits the animal-- What's the medallion? That's um-- for my birthday. For my sobriety birthday. Well-- what's that mean? Meaning, how many years I haven't had a drink. They say-- and after you get sober-- the number of years you have sober is your maturity level. So I'm six years old. You're older than I am. Sorry. It's all right. There's toothpaste in my bag. You're going to ruin your gums brushing like that. Why? Here, let me get it. All right. You want to go down, start at the gums, and go down, see? And then at the bottom, you go up. Start at the gum line, go down-- down strokes. Yup. Away from the gums. Hey, eat your pancakes. It'll give you energy for the hike. Alex only ate half his french toast. Well, he's smaller. Can we go down the waterfall? No, stupid. We'd die. Look, you can't go down the waterfall. It's very big, very powerful, and there's rocks at the bottom. And every once in a while somebody gets trapped in the current at the top and they do go over the side. And they die? Yup. I don't want to die. Everyone dies. I'm not going to. You're going to freaking die. You can go down the waterfall and die. All done here, guys? Yeah. Listen, neither of you is going to die for a very long time. And when do, you don't have to go to Yosemite, OK? When you die, you can go wherever you want. Roundtable? You want to go to Roundtable Pizza? Come on, guys. Chris, be careful. Wait for me. Chris, wait up. Wait up. Get off me. Hey! What are you doing? He pushed me first. Did not. Hey. I told you to look after him. He did it first. Are you OK? You OK? Come on. Come on, Chris. Water? Sure. I'm going to go explore. It's been a long. There you go. You gotta be careful. All right, find me a small stick. Can you find one? There, there, there. There. Dear God, I know I have sinned. Sometimes I just wish my brother didn't exist. I-- I hope that I do something good before I die. Amen. OK, try that one. Help me build my little house. Dad, that's not the way we came. All right, let's-- we'll go this way. It'll be faster. It's not the right way. You guys wait here. Go with your brother. Let's go. Come on. Come on. It's OK. It's OK. All right. We are dirty boys, so we're all going to take showers, OK? Who wants to be first? Can we call Mom? It's too late to call Mom, OK? Are you going to call the police? We can call the rangers after we eat. OK. I'll call now. Hi, may I have the ranger station please? Thanks. Hi. I'm a guest over at the uh-- Ahwahnee. Um, I was walking with my boys um, near Mirror Lake earlier today and we came across a burning pile. There was a skeleton. Just ribcage and feet. Mm-hmm. We're in 707. Peterson. Thank you very much. Have a good night. It sounds like it was a bear. It was human. The rangers said it was a bear that was getting too friendly because people were feeding it so they had to shoot it. If it was getting friendly, then why did they shoot it? Because bears and people have different ways of being friendly. Now come on. Who's going to take the first shower-- you? Waiting for you to call. I am a hunter, you are the prey. Let me wrap my body around you and tell I'm hungry and thirsty. Fuck me. Fuck me. So you guys know how babies are made? I think so. Yeah? How? The man and the woman get naked in the bath together. Who told you that? My friend Nicole. Well, Nicole's wrong. You do get naked, but you don't have to get into the bath. Usually you do it in the bed. Why? It's more comfortable there. Why are they naked? They're naked because the man needs to put his penis in the woman's vagina. What? That's gross. I know. Well it's not gross if you love each other. You and Mom? Yeah, that's how we made you guys. Do you still do it? No. But we still love each other in our own way. That's not what Mom says. Now do it from the gum and go down. Yeah, just like that. There you go. Down, down, near the bottom-- do the bottom one. Yup. All right. You done? Spit. Wash that out. There you go. OK, come on. There you go. Mooshoo, mooshoo, mooshoo, moo-- Alex, come on. Stop. Thank you, Jasmine. Hello. Hey, Lindsay. How you doing? Good, thanks. Hello. How's it going? Empty your pockets, son. Why? Why, you got something to hide? No. Then empty your pockets. Give me. Come on. Other one. Hey! Well. It's mine. This is not yours until you pay for it. I swear it's true. My mom bought it for me the other day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come with me. I swear, the Chinese man was working. Just-- Chinese, yeah. Stand over there and don't move. What's your phone number? Why? I'm going to call your mom and tell her what you did. Come on. I'm calling your mom. What's the number? It's all right, man. I'll pay for it. You two know each other? No, it's just a piece of gum, you know? And you're going to teach him that it's OK to pay to get out of jail, huh? 60 cents. Thank you. But let me tell you, I never want to see you in my store again. You understand? That guy sucked. He was really mean. You don't need his stupid store, you know? I have-- I have plenty of comics at home. Where do you live? Near the high school. I'm not walk allowed to walk past down this street. Well you-- come over and I'll drive you home after. Come on. My comics are on the shelf if you want to check them out. You want to read out loud? No. Let me see. "Good evening Mr. And Mrs. Pollard. Did you enjoy the show?" "Who could enjoy anything these days with that menace ruining our great city?" "What menace, Mrs. Pollard?" "Haven't you read the paper? Here-- have a look. That wretched, slithering Night Crimson, that's who." "But what can they have against Night Crimson, sir? He's a hero." You want to try that one? "Wonder if he will allow our youngsters to mimic his venomous ways." "You must find a way to prevent that dangerous creature from taking the law into his own hands." "Please don't let it--" "Don't let it ruin--" "Ruin the rest of your evening, Mr. and Mrs. Pollard." Very good. "And do, a lonely doorman sits and waits with the fate of society in his hands. What will Night Crimson do next?" We have 3/4 plus 1/2. They have different demoninators-- 4 and 2. So what are you going to do? First thing, find the common denominator by finding the common multiple. So you take 2 and you add, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12-- and multiples of 2. And multiples of 4. 4, 8, 12, 16. And then we notice that the smallest on is 4. So you circle the 4 and circle the 4 again. So we're going to try to get our denominators to 4. When we look at 3/4 and we're moving to step two, you have common denominators. If you look at 3/4, that already has 4 different denominators. Ow! We don't want to change that. So if we multiply by one on the bottom and we do the same thing at the top-- because whatever we do at the bottom we have to do the top because the fraction stays the same-- we'll end up with 3/4 plus 1/2. Now how are we going to get the 2 to be a 4 on the bottom? Ow! Joe, what's going on? He's bothering me. He started it. All right, both of you-- outside right now. The rest of you, please continue copying the steps down. You two are not going to be able to sit next to each other and I don't want you talking to each other-- But he started it. Until you learn to be respectful towards each other. Now apologize. I'm sorry, Joe. I'm confused. You said you talked to Jodi and then two minutes later Palmer cancelled the wedding. What's going on? She loved James and the rest of us are just left to pick up the pieces. Kate, I want to help you. Please talk to me. Palmer lied-- You have to tell her what really happened between us. And now she's with Brad? Before he took off for Rome-- yes. Brad and Jodi were destined to be together-- Hello? She's not here right now. She's at an engineering conference. I'm taking care of Joe this week. What did Joe do? I see. I'll let them know. Bitch. Who was that? It was Ted's mom. She says she doesn't want you playing at their house anymore because of what happened at school today. What did you do? Nothing. Are you sure? Joe. Mind your own business. I'm not isolating myself. I just need-- I need room to grow and-- Our study of the United States history today takes the sad turn. We're going to focus on the story of Native American tribe, the Cherokee. We know that there were people living in the United States-- what became the United States-- before the Europeans managed to sail their way across the Atlantic. And for the most part, the new folks got along with the old folks. However, the Indians still slowly lost more and more land. Hey. Hey. You walked all the way here? So I just followed the train tracks to the high school. You want a soda, buddy? Yeah. Can I pick a comic? Sure. I hope you're careful on the way over here. Yeah. I don't want you getting hurt. Yeah my dad told me that when he was little, a woman got hit by a train. But instead of bouncing off and lying there in one piece, she exploded. That's terrible Yeah. Your dad is probably trying to tell you he doesn't want you walking on the train tracks. Yeah. He doesn't live at home anymore. Where does he live? In Sunnyvale. "Ow, my eyes. What's happening to me?" "Give me your infrared vision, Night Crimson, and I will leave you to shed your reptilian skin." "Never. I'm here to relieve you of your duties. Major Rider." "Never." "The nuclear reactor! No!" OK. You can be Bobby. "Help! My dad is growing a second head." "I'll save you! Oh! The nuclear radiation!" Get off. Get off of me. Sorry. It's getting late. I should probably go. Yeah, it's getting pretty late, huh? Mm-hmm. Bye, Henry. All right Joe, see you. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Why are you smiling? No reason. Ew. What are you doing? Nothing. What is it? Stop playing with it. Stop it! Come here, you're bleeding. Phone makers claim that a mobile phone is in your future. If you don't have one now, you will within the next decade. Although they currently cost up towards $3,000, I'll be back in a few minutes. New cellular technology is driving prices down to something more affordable. Among users in the Bay Area are an airport shuttle service and private detective Tom Beck. When you're trying to find quarters all the time-- 6-year-old Justin Mellan-- 100 stiches and all-- is the latest victim in California's ongoing confrontation, man against nature. In this case, boy against mountain lion. Park officials say there may be 25 to 30 of the animals in the area that at a one time was a vast range and is now just five miles from housing developments. They're getting more used to people and they're not as scared of them. Dear god, I walked on the rocks for you today. I hope you're taking good care of Don so when I die I can see him again. I miss him a lot. Good night. So in making our observations of our classroom to terrariums, I want you to keep in mind that there are many habitats. That they have features that will interact with each other. And we're looking at those interactions that will have living and not-living features, and will also have interactions between the plants and the animals, and the animals and the animals. I am the devil? So I want you to make careful note thinking about where shelter could be in a habitat. Ow! Ow! Oh my goodness! Fight, fight, fight, fight. Boys, stop. Ted, Ted, Ted! That's enough. Enough, both of you. That's enough. Hey, Bud. Hey. Got your shoes off. I'm thirsty. Here, drink. "Soon, so very soon I'll have beaten you, Nigh Crimson, at last." "And after the final transformation, they must start over again-- repeating the cycle." You smell like cigarettes. Is that a good smell? Yeah. Your soda. How was school? I got in trouble. Why? My friend Ted. What about him? He started playing the game again. What's the game? It's not really a game. What is it? What do you do to each other? You punch each other? No. Does he kick you. No. Does he pinch you? Yeah. And then you go like this, and you pinch him here. Yeah. Uh-huh. And what you do back? Same thing. Well you know you don't have to play that game with Ted if you don't want to. I don't want to. "Before I annihilate you Night Crimson, I have to say I admire your heart." "Sorry to inform you, Python, but I have no heart. Only venom." My dad used to read to me. Oh yeah? Well he lives in Sunnyvale now, right? He lived with me before my brother died. He got meningitis from his kindergarten teacher. My mom always says my dad was sleeping when he was supposed to check on my little brother. And that's how my little brother died. I'm really sorry to hear that, Bud. Shall we keep reading? Yeah. You want to be Night Crimson? Sure. "I will have my revenge, Night Crimson." "You're going to hiss your very last breath at me, Python? No sweat. All is safe. Hope no one found my uniform. Nope, here it is." "And within moments, incredible Night Crimson regains his post on east 85th street as Andy Altman." I wish I could be Andy Altman. Then I could be Night Crimson and I'd never have to die. Well I'll call Andy if you want? Sure. You going to make it home before dark? Yeah. Can I try your cigarette? Maybe next time, Andy. You're going to come back, right? Yeah. I like it when you visit me. Me too. Here. What's this? It's flat from the train. I don't want you getting in trouble for crossing Alma. I won't tell. OK. Bye. See you, Joe. Shrimp, it's dinnertime. Shrimp? Coming. I had a bad dream. What are you doing? Talking to some friends on the computer. All the information comes through the phone lines, and it connects everybody in the well, and their computers together, and we can talk. It's pretty cool, huh? Mm-hmm. You and Joe not been getting along? No. Why? He doesn't want to be friends anymore. You know he's been going through a hard time, right? Does it seem that way? It's going to be OK but you gotta some sleep buddy, OK? OK. Let's go to bed. I'll tuck you in. Good night, Bud. Good night, Dad. Your mom said I should walk you home. I'm fine on my own. He gets the ring and becomes super powerful. They call him the Gollum Devil and he rules over everyone. All the hobbits become like Gollum. Whoa, so they all become evil? Yeah. See you tomorrow. OK. See you. Hey sweetie. Did Chris walk you home today? Have you seen Charlie? Well, he's around here somewhere. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. I am the Gollum Devil. So did you guys see the second Indiana Jones movie? Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, you're not getting my heart, I'm sorry. I like the first one better. Guys, do you want to play football at recess? Sure. It looks like superior. Um, I've got science. I think I've got science, too. Your name shouldn't be Joe Douglas, it should be Joe Dickless. Joe Dickless is scared shitless. Hey, Dick Face, look at me. We're sorry Mr. Dick Face. I hope my mom makes me better stuff. I hate this. Hey Daniel. Hey. Is this Ted? Yeah. A mountain lion was spotted in broad daylight near the Palo Alto Caltrain station today. A number of domestic animals have been reported missing. Authorities have attempted to capture the animals, and so far have had no luck shooting tranquilizer darts at it and missing each attempt. What a bunch of incompetent idiots. Listen, three times. Those darts are tricky. Ted's cat is missing. Is he? What does he looks like? He's an orange tabby. Yeah? You going to put a poster up? Not yet, I'm going to. you see this , he was drunk. My friend Ned shoots it. And the panther falls out of the tree. You hear the crashing and the branches-- there are splinters everywhere. Then all of a sudden the VC starts shooting us and we shoot at them and I should this kids in the bushes. We go over and look at the body. And we take his pants off and this kid has the hugest schlong I've ever seen and it's like a snake. And uh-- I got a picture of it, kneeling, holding that. I made a couple of earrings out of that foreskin. And they dangle, right, when you go like this? Sick, man. if you know that there's no one from your family picking you up, I want you to walk with another person. There's no need to panic, everything will be fine. The police are removing the mountain lion to its natural habitat. Any questions? Nicole? Why did it come to Palo Alto? That's a good question. It came to Palo Alto because the city has been spreading, it's been moving into the wilderness area. And the mountain lion needs a very large habitat. It's come down and spread into the suburbs as we've moved into its area. Yes? What does the mountain lion eat in Palo Alto? From what I understand, it's not really coming into the suburbs of Palo Alto to eat, but to really find water. So I would like you to go straight home, be safe, and I will see you tomorrow. Hilarious. Oh my god. Hi. Hi. Hi. You want us to walk with you? No, I think it's safer to take the bus. Ted's cat was killed by the mountain lion. Really? Yeah. That's crazy. We should probably go. OK. Bye. Do you think he likes me? Dad? Did Charlie die? Come here. We don't know for sure but most likely yes. Check this out. "Hello. I am the ghost of a cat named Charlie. I have come here to contact the ghost or other cats." And now we wait. Why don't you ever sleep? I can't fall asleep. You know why? Why? Go like this, go like that, and then you go, I have insomnia. I have insomnia. It means I can't fall asleep. I am the ghost of Bean. I died peacefully in my sleep in 1983 and hope to see Charlie in heaven. Is Charlie's ghost real? No, not really. I guess not. But a little real? I think we should play Cosmic Avengers. You know we could play poker and blackjack because we're not going to get a chance to actually play poker. Where's Daniel? He works at the VA on Wednesdays. Hello? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, he's here. OK. See you tonight. Who was it? My mom. Alex is scared. He's at the dance studio with her. You want to see something? Lubricated for her pleasure? Whoa. Is it real? Is it from Vietnam? Take game fire. Get in cover. Taking every fire. Hey look, it's Dickless. What do you want? What do you want? Oh shit. We're going to hunt the mountain lion. Unless you're too scared. Yeah Dickless. Scared? Fuck off. Get down. Shit. Someone's going to see us. Stop. OK. Let's go. Hmm. That's what he'll do with Ted. Hey. No, he'll probably do it with you, Chris. Oh, yeah. Funny. Really? Do you like wimps? Here. It's like whack-a-mole. Yeah. Boom boom boom! Get down! Pow! Boom! Come on, I'm wounded. Let's go! Pow pow pow! Man down! Man down! Let's go, let's go! What was that? There's nothing there? Turn the safety off. Ow! Oh, shit! You OK? What the hell were you thinking about? We're going to go to the hospital. We're going to tell them we took you hunting and then we had an accident. Is that understood? You boys are lucky it was just a graze. So I'm sure that you've heard that the mountain lion was killed last night. It's such a shame that the police had to kill such a beautiful and majestic creature. It might be nice now to take some time to honor the life of this mountain lion. We'll close our eyes and bow our heads and take a moment of silence for that. Hey. Wanna go? I can help. Chris isn't with you? No. Do you wan to come to my house? Can't. I'm going to a friends. What friend? You don't know him. I have the Dark Crystal. OK, I'll come. Did you know about the guy who does the voices on Sesame Street? Arthur does the voices of the sketches from the Dark Crystal. Really? Yeah. Oh yeah, I heard that he also does the Mystics. How's your leg? It's OK. Ew. Can I show you something? Sure. We never found Charlie, but I made this for him.
