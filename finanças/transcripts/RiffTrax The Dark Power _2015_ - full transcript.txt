An unexpected turn today. John Cody, often known as four eagles Cody, died just as he was about to deliver his last will and testament, before his attorney and my videographer. [Kevin] Even worse, his death fart melted the tape in the camera and left several more dead. Had intended to air portion of the will in tomorrow's newscast. But all that exists now is Cody's last word. Toltec. The meaning of which I hope to discover and report to you in the near future.

He lived alone on Totem Hill. High school pranksters would often invade his property. And many of the kids claimed they saw him practicing magic. And ancient rites from dusk to dawn. [Kevin] These teenagers really didn't have a lot going on. Cody admitted they were correct. Claiming there are evil days of which one must guard the four quarters of the world.

This land belongs to me now. [Mike] Three words. Pontoon boat store. I was a very good friend of your grandfather's. and he had some definite ideas about this land. Yeah ideas that would do me no good. [Kevin] Like a unibrow trimmer? (Bill laughs) This house should go to a bunch of old indian mystics. I understood your grandfather's religion and faith. And they lived in poverty. This should be a luxury to them. [Bill] Oh, she's luxurious. She's my rat skin cap. And all at no profit to me. Your grandfather took good care of you David. And when the treaty showed that he owned most of this land around here, he shared with everyone. [Mike] Even the women folk which I didn't approve of. Practiced rituals older than white man's America. Cody should have bought a Mercedes and headed for Vegas. Hell that's what I'd have done. [Kevin] Thanks for being here background guy! Not the most refined and eloquent of men. Yet he speaks the truth. [Bill] And the truth is, DENIM! Refined and eloquent? What the hell? Ought to kick his red ass! [Mike] Wait.

And then I get to thinking, no. It's just harder for me to get to them. I can't believe that YOU would have any problems there Mr. Girard. [Bill] You WOULD'NT? (Mike laughs) Of course some girls might be a little crazier about whips than others. You know about my whip? [Mike] Whatever twisted dating site brought these two together, needs to be SHUT DOWN immediately! (Kevin laughs) All about the heroic forest ranger who goes out and hunts down and corrals wild animals. [Kevin] And wears his eagle scout uniform to bars. Whoooo!! No one ever sees me. Station did a story on you last month Wasn't it a cougar? Cougar, bear, wild dog. Doesn't make any difference. [Bill] I'll hump anything on god's green earth! To a cage. And then you send the caged animal to the wild life resources department. [Mike] The sexiest department of all. (Kevin laughs) You're a good reporter. I'm just fascinated by interesting men. [Kevin] Oh! I get what's happening! She thinks he's the Dos Equis guy! Toltecs I think. Oh back to business. The Toltecs. A Mexican tribe. Let's see. They existed about a thousand years ago. [Bill] So naturally she's attracted to them. The Toltec's gods and myths formed the basis for much of the Aztec religion. And Aztec noblemen often claimed a (indistinct) from the Toltecs. [Mike] But only to help their college application. I don't know. And? The news department is in charge of a community affairs type show. It runs at odd ball times on Saturdays. [Kevin] Odd ball times. Like five quirky. and seventeen o'clock. Might be able to run parts of it on the morning news. Might be a nice tribute to Cody. Could be. And I emphasize could be. I would show the proper respect for Cody. [Mike] And I'll make sure my sexy head dress and war paint are historically accurate. Maybe this is our chance to do him justice. [Bill] And Cody's F Troop audition is cued up. I get their attention that way. Is that about ready? Yeah I think it is working now. You're sure? We didn't lose anything? [Mike] Because that free style rap was flawless. Better not be any glitches on that tape. Don't worry. I haven't let you down yet have I? Let's do it. What about that green video last week? Tapes rolling. [Kevin] He hears more about that green video than Buckner heard about game six. I think we were talking about the eagle symbol. Yes eagles. The eagles were the attendants of the gods of the daytime powers. [Bill] Lash learned how to prep for interviews from Oliver Reed. Four eagles? There are four cardinal points on the compass. And the number four is significant in American Indian culture. [Mike] The ancient ones called it the Fab Four. Christian faith. Now their ritual calender, is divided into four equal parts. Each one corresponding. [Kevin] Why do they look so green? Oh crap! The Toltecs. Why was Cody so obsessed with the Toltecs? They were from Mexico. They didn't have anything to do with his heritage? [Bill] Why can't people stick to their own kind, is what I'm asking. He and many of the elders of his tribe believed in age-old myths or legends. [Mike] Ugh. I cancelled the Ayatollah interview for THIS? Brutal and outcast tribe moved far north. And they said to have moved close to this community. But we're hundreds and hundreds of miles. Don't give me a lesson in geography. [Kevin] My uncle was a Rand McNally! Such a move. But Cody believed the legend. And on this very ground. [Bill] Where I just spit out my gum. That is, they worshiped from below. Only the Toltec sorcerers were actually allowed to stand on the power spot. Totem Hill. [Mike] Do not open reporter until Christmas. (Kevin laughs) They served the god of the nocturnal skies. Who symbolize the destructive principles of the universe. The dark powers. [Kevin] Such as seals. If it's alright with David, I'll read Cody's diary. There might be something in there that would help your story. [Bill] I could find out if he had a crush on me. I mean help your story! There is something you can do for me Miss Dalton. Lunch, dinner? My phone number? No no. I was gonna tell you about the whip. [Mike] Care to ghost write it? I think that might just be a little bit out of my field. Oh no. This is a gift from Cody. [Kevin] And I am not INTO you! Gathered from the four quarters of the world. And it's said to have power to protect. [Bill] Guys keep pulling up Tim Burton's property markers. I would like you to mention the whip was a gift from Cody to me in your story. A symbol of homage from you to the spirit of John Cody. Beautifully put. [Mike] And that'll be my cue to pour out my forty. (bell rings) [Kevin] A lovely funeral was held for the news program's only viewer. Who hung himself out of boredom. (bell rings) [Bill] Thank you for coming! Vote God! Thanks again! Remember to vote God! I'm afraid the preacher's sermon didn't do much to uplift your spirit Beth. No it's not that. It just that I hate the thought of trying to look for a new place next quarter. I mean it's so much fun. [Mike] I'm listening. No really. It was the best time in my life. And I'm sorry, but I refuse to commute. Hey you make home sound like torture in comparison. [Kevin] Now come on! mom's rectally feeding us chicken pot pie tonight! and of course I had to get a high number. Anyway 45 miles is too far away to commute. Hey Beth! Heard you didn't make the cut. Listen I'll let you borrow my pup tent okay? You sarcastic little twerp! [Bill] Didn't you learn anything from my freakin sermon!!!?? Why couldn't I have been born an only child? Lynn you'll be looking for a room too, won't you? Yeah, but. I don't care. I mean I didn't like the girls in my suite anyway. [Mike] (slurring words) They said I was a boozier Sean Young. Hey yeah! Beth I think I know just the thing! Come on! Mary! [Kevin] Walter Shobach before he went shabas. Mary! Mary! Mary tell Beth about the house. Hi! Beth! How are you? Just fine. How long will you be in town? [Bill] Ugh. Etiquette takes forever Tomorrow afternoon. You know newspeople never get any. Tell her about the house Mary! [Mike] What does it have? A water slide? Calm down! I think you might like it. The owner died about a month ago. It's like new. Really new. It's really big! And get a lot of girls in there. Be just like a sorority house. Great! Tell me more about it. [Kevin] Gah. Enough about this house! (Bill laughs) It has weathered wood on the outside, four bedrooms, sunken tub. [Bill] Wraith with tomahawks. How did you find out about a place like this anyway? Well I did a few news stories on him. Yeah, yeah. Escorted by four indian sorcerers. [Kevin] Like gag me with a peace pipe! Garden. Indian sorcerers. Yeah these four Toltec witch doctors types did some kind of magic. Dark powers! [Mike] Heh. And where's your room in relation to mine? (laughing) Is it safe to live in? Well I hear that the landlord wants to dispel a lot of the myths so. The rent should be low [Kevin] The body count should be high. Take a chance beth! Come on! Take a chance! ♪♪♪ [Bill] And that once in a lifetime chance turned out to be a beige ranch bungalow with three windows. [Mike] Great. My coat matches the house! ♪♪♪ Whoa. [Kevin] Unairated lawns give me the creeps. (knocking) [Bill] The frigid tundra that is south eastern United States. Boo! Hi Tammy. Funny! [Mike] Opening doors I just knocked on! Girl you better watch out. Honey Toltec sorcerers were bad dudes. Tammy I never even heard of the Toltecs until Mary told me about the house. You mean you didn't know about this place? [Kevin] Don't you watch the community affairs type show that runs at odd ball times on Saturdays? (Mike laughs) Hey where's Susan? She's in her room. You share? Yeah but the owner wants two to a room. It's not that bad. Come on. You'll love it. Come on! [Bill] Don't let the door hit you on the way in! You'll love it. Already told Mr. Cody you were moving in and can move in as soon as you pay your deposit. [Mike] Well it does look like a good place for my door to door sales business. Beth I really do feel like an outcast. I mean this is the second year I didn't get a low number. [Kevin] Why did I enroll in scarce housing university? On everything. I mean my social life? The total pits. Beth I never dreamed I wouldn't get a room on campus this quarter. [Bill] I was SO looking foward to getting policed by a power tripping RA. Bring the men to where we are. You talking MY kind of trash now lady! [Mike] And over here is the gratuitous crotch room. Oh geez would you look at this? You'd think she was getting ready for a date with Tom Selleck. [Kevin] Or whoever plays Higgins. Tammy! Hey girl! How are you? Fine and you? Are you moving in today? You kidding? The house on totem hill. Uh oh. Come on, you'll love it. Well that's what I hear. and by the look of this place. [Bill] Man she suffers from renters schizophrenia. So we got the big bedroom. And you haven't even SEEN the fringe benefits yet. Honey you're not gonna believe this. Come on. [Mike] You GOTTA see this Schlitz poster I found. It's out of this world. Bath. Ooooo whooo! [Kevin] Fully carpeted bathroom? Whoo hoo! Whoever stayed here was a really a Rockefeller in disguise. Well no Tammy. I think it just took it after the place was built. Anyway come on. There's a lot more to see. [Bill] If you think that tub was fancy you're gonna flip over the spray hose on the kitchen sink! [Kevin] Whoo hoo! Would you check this cabinet space? [Mike] AJAX? You sure this wasn't JP Morgan's old place? Oh wow. Hey Beth. Where are we gonna put all the beer I'm gonna bring? Tammy you would think of that. [Kevin] You late stage alcoholic. Okay great. Oh we can take turns cooking huh? Child. I make a mean lasagna! [Bill] I mean really CRUEL! It finds your flaws and it doesn't let up. Let me show you to your room. Wait a minute Beth. All I said. I know what you said Tammy. But you'll come around. [Mike] Yeah Tammy. Just focus on the cabinet space! Downstairs you have own choice of bedrooms. Honey it is definitely better than the dorm rooms. Isn't that the truth! [Kevin] Don't you dare bad mouth the dorms! Sorry renter's schizophrenia again! Nice. No sunken bath tub but it'll suffice. And over here. [Bill] Is Tom Cruise wearing a Vince t-shirt. Are you kidding? I hate pool. Susan's a recreational freak around here. Did you know it took ten guys to bring this ugly thing in here? [Mike] Ten guys? Were they all Don Knots clones? (Kevin laughs) Well I like pool. And here we have our own laundry room. Complete with indian artifacts left by the previous owner. [Kevin] some human remains, maybe a hot plate. I don't know. I haven't looked through it yet. But I've never seen them look like this before. See usually the eagle is set up on top of a skull's head, and it symbolizes good or evil. [Bill] But we'll use it to clean the lint trap. Honey I've heard a lot about this house. That's why I'm not even for sure I want to stay here. [Kevin] Oh come on. Our laundry room looks like a refugee. And it smells like a fart! [Bill] Well. Hey! What did you think? Well. Oh come on you'll love it! It'll be great! All the shouting about? [Mike] Also sure I heard gun shots and animals dying. Tammy um, this is Lynn. Lynn this is Tammy. Tammy Lynn Lynn. Tammy. [Bill] Wait who am I? [Kevin] You're Lynn. [Bill] No no. I'm Tammy, you're Lynn. [Kevin] So then, who's Lynn? [Bill] Tammy is Lynn. But that's you! [Kevin] So I'm Lynn right Tammy? [Bill] I don't know. Cheapest place in town. Best company in the world. Lots of party room! [Mike] And we need a lot of party room as we are college students and definitely not 30 year old bank tellers. Plenty of privacy if you happen to have a FRIEND. MM hmm. (laughs) See all you have to do is say yes? YES! Don't rush her! [Kevin] The director's main note was "no one, at any time, should act like a real human being." She may have other plans or something. [Bill] Or maybe there's just not enough party space her being such a crazy college student. And all? Where's the phone? Uh. Well. One little item this house never had. [Mike] No phone. But there is that pervasive fart smell. [Bill] Huh? Electricity? Tammy we have electricity. Okay. Not even he'd like things that simple. Come on. I'll show you where the nearest phone is. What was that? Hello David. How are you? Just fine thank you. I knew you'd be here today. And I just wanted to come by and thank you for telling your friends about the house. Four of them moved in already, and another tenant coming in this afternoon. [Bill] Also I just took a class on how to speak in the most boring manner possible. How do you think I'm doing? Really interested in the story. Sure come by anytime. Good. I think I left my note book in the court room. Will you excuse me? Okay. [Mike] Okaya! It's the new duller way of saying OKAY. (Kevin laughs) Mr. Girard what are you doing here? Hi Miss Dalton. I'm here three or four times a month. [Kevin] Well that explains what you're DOING here then! Yes we just tried a fellow I arrested last month for shooting fish. Shooting fish? [Bill] Yeah Lou Zeland is an angry drunk. What can I tell you? The story about the fish making so much noise he couldn't sleep. That's ridiculous! [Mike] It's not nearly as ridiculous as you fawning over the aged whip carrying park ranger! Speaking of stories. I was just talking to David Cody and I was thinking about going out to the house to do a follow up. [Bill] I told him that already, and it was such riveting cinema, I thought I'd thrill the audience by saying it again. Might be something interesting. Okay. Right around here. That's the old man! Those WERE noisy fish! [Kevin] The dark power. Come for the lengthy dog whipping scenes, stay for the humor. You know it's too bad you didn't come by here when you first started your story. I've been keeping up on the Cody place since I started working here. [Mike] I keep asking for one, maybe two more 20 watt bulbs. But they won't give in. I'm a history/mathematics major. So I'm kind of interested in things such as Totem Hill and local legends. Well you know. This is interesting. But it doesn't really tell me anything I don't know. [Bill] That's what I say every time I'm done watching The Electric Company. Find some interesting information. Take a look at this. What is it? It was filed away with some government documents. We got a whole file cabinet back there full of things pertaining to federal investigations concerning this county area. [Kevin] So if you ever need anything that's interesting but doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. I'm your man. See after he proved, that the treaties were still enforceable. You mean after the federal courts ruled in his favor. [Mike] (slurs words) In his favor! (Bill laughs) This is news. [Bill] (slurs words) What was it? [Mike] (slurs words) Yeah what was it? You're talking about? He made a formal written request that the land be destroyed. Uprooted, graded and that if any archeological artifacts were found, they were to be turned over to the US Navy and buried at sea. [Bill] He also shot a lot of fish because they were too noisy. Kind of a thing we do around here. Found that four Toltec sorcerers had buried themselves there several. [Kevin] (gruff voice) I was in the navy and I retired. (Bill laughs) Why did he want everything dumped in the ocean? The Toltecs believed that if they buried themselves alive. Buried alive? [Mike] I ought to do a follow up story on burying people alive. They hushed it up to try to keep from being embarrassed. Anyway, about the legend. These buried sorcerers fed on the blood of the living in order to remain alive. [Bill] Yep. That's what Madonna does too. Practiced all those dusk to dawn rituals to keep the Toltec sorcerers under control. That explains it all. [Kevin] (laughs) It does???!!! (Mike laughs) Built on Totem Hill. Cody went before the courts to get control of the property surrounding it. [Mike] (gruff voice) Gin and bourbon for everyone! Reimbursed the contractor and gave the house the house to Cody. Of course the contractors were glad to get rid of the place. Three of their workmen were listed as missing. during the construction of the home. [Bill] May have something to do with that fart smell! Yes he thought that the Toltec sorcerers got them. So my quiet unassuming friend, John Cody, went before the government of the United States. And demanded that they let him have control. [Kevin] (slurred words) Okay I'm gonna grab a nap. UGH. Wouldn't have asked for it if he hadn't thought he was protecting the people that were laughing at him. What a self sacrificing man he was. [Mike] I declare this scene over. Good bye.

And who is Susan? Susan? Wake up sleepy head! We have a workout today. Oh god I'm so sorry Paige. I forgot all about the time. [Mike] You forgot about the workout, yet you were sitting in your room dressed like that? Go ahead and change. Yeah sure. [Bill] Hey that's my digging through the fridge outfit too! [Kevin] Oh! That day old flat Keystone light was not as good as I thought it would be. [Bill] Good workout so far. [Mike] Let's see what's new in Bass Pro magazine. Hmm. Those hip waders are cute!

Eliminating this guy from the planet and making sure he NEVER multiplies. Gonna be here for some time. No. From the looks of things I'm soon gonna be a very busy young man. [Mike] The cinematography and art direction are so rich. What do I look at? The towel in background? One of the many door jams? Really it's a symphony for the eyes. Well end of the dream. Always knew Lynn was a spiteful bitch. But I never knew she's stoop this low. [Kevin] Time for them to make a run on hand sanitizer and pepper spray. God Susan, you wouldn't believe my day today. I went to class and she has already assigned a project for tomorrow. That's kind of early. [Bill] Hot flossing action. (Kevin laughs) And then I went to the library and was gonna get some work done I lost my notebook. I don't know how I lost it in the library. So I went [Mike] Let's see if we can get a shot of some shredded three day old pork chop in there. Came back here, thinking that the problems of the world were gone. And then you found out about Craig. [Kevin] Then I took the dog for a walk. And some old lunatic tried to whip it. Just relax and forget the problems of the world. Uh you don't usually take a bath in the afternoon? (guys laugh) Really need one. [Bill] (laughs) She has to be related to Mitchell. We just got finished working out. Sorry. Don't worry about it. I'll just, take a shower. [Mike] Okay. But Craig is washing his army jacket in the shower. Dance class. Gotta run. Have you seen my sweats? No I haven't seen them, sorry. Maybe I actually hung them up for a change. [Kevin] DID she hang up her sweats for a change? The DARK POWER! Ooo. We're running out of bubbles. [Bill] Speaking of permasoft, their attempts to be erotic are just not making the grade for me. You don't want some geek getting his jollies if he looks in. We're so isolated out here it really doesn't matter. Then again, now that Lynn pulled that little stunt. [Kevin] Someone order a sleazebag? Susan can I use your shampoo? Oh hey, Susan's not back but I'm sure she won't mind. Go ahead. Craig get out of here! What are you doing here? [Bill] Get out, buy me a shower curtain and then come back and install it! Get out! Well, hello again, Excuse I just came in to flush down a few butts. Didn't realize there were already a couple of butts in here. Yeah. ♪♪♪ Listen asshole! [Bill] (underwater voice) Why did I stick my own head in the toilet bowl? Got that scum bag? [Bill] And why aren't I removing my head when there's no force keeping it here? [Kevin] Well, did she hang up her sweats for a change or not??!!! So you're both a math and history major? That's uh, quite a combination. [Mike] I'm determined to be unemployable and boring ma'am. Do you ever have any time for other things? Other things? [Bill] You know. Like restoring old hickory LAWN furniture, hmm? Do you think she's pretty? Yeah of course I think she's pretty. I doubt she'd be interested in me anyway. Besides I've never talked to her. [Kevin] I should probably put on some half gloves and leer at her in the shower. I'm interested. I'm interested. I bet I could set you up with her. [Mike] (shouting) The Dark Power! My social life suffers working with a double major and working down at the court house. I never seem to have time to talk with people. Like um. [Bill] Except for this interminable scene. Why do have time for THIS? Always in the right places, while others? Need a little help. Like me. I am a pretty good match maker. [Kevin] Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungin. That was me. Alright sure. How are your calculations coming? Oh yeah, um. I think my first guesstimate was correct. [Mike] Folks at home if you wondering whether or not it was okay to hate this kid, he just said "guesstimate". [Kevin] So HATE away! Get some new footage from around the house. Yeah it's too bad. Would have made a great story. [Bill] My "guesstimate" is that story would have fascinated the dozen people still tuning into your station after a rerun of Green Acres. Mm hmm. Really ought to go out there and tell Beth. She ought to know that we're doing a story but I don't think have time to drive. [Mike] Not when there's a creepy teen's romantic life to sort out that is. Grandfather's passed away. Yeah it does. I'll call Mr. Girard. He might have time to, drive out. Good idea. [Kevin] Whoo! South eastern United States will rise again! (humming) Craig can you drop me off at school? [Bill] The school I go to in the middle of the night? I need a ride. Well how have you been getting to school? Beth and Susan. Well ask them. We're not exactly speaking. Tell you what, that bitch had better shape up. Or I'm gonna teach her tail a lesson. [Mike] Is her tail familiar with Howard's End's of people's history of the United States? Wait a minute. Dallas and Al are in school this year aren't they? Yeah I wish they weren't. I can't stand them. Okay okay. I'll give you a ride. And I think I'll drop it on those two. We might just have a little party here this evening. Now Craig! Put Susan's lovely butt in order. [Kevin] Dallas is a fully licensed and bonded butt repair specialist. Alan? UGH! Oh get out of here and let me get ready will ya? Bitch. [Bill] Punched up dialog by Brett Easton Ellis. He wasn't home. (Mike laughs) Left a message with the service. Uh that's too bad. [Mike] I simonized my hair for this and everything. Oh I'm sure he would. He'd be glued to his TV set. You know I bet he misses Cody. Yeah. You can see it in his eyes. [Kevin] No actually that's jaundice. He has these really sensitive eyes. Well I don't know about sensitive eyes. But I do know that Cody is part of a world gone by. And Girard misses him. [Bill] So are we gonna Mary Kay Letourneau or what? You don't think that Mr. Girard believes in Cody's legends do you? No. But I do realize that there is some truth. In all legends. [Mike] Especially the legend of Curly's Gold! [Bill] So much truth. And the fact is, according to fiction anyway, that tonight's the night four eagle's dreaded most. [Kevin] The friars are roasting him tonight.

[Bill] I want to run over those nice dogs from the beginning of the movie Uncle Earl! This job I'll never know. (fart noise) Sick Uncle Earl! [Mike] Hard to believe this guy is Frederick Eisman professor of poetry at Yale. Worry anybody half to death. Hey man! You're right! The GoodYear blimp is at the door! [Kevin] It's gonna provide aerial coverage of our sad little party! (music plays) Hey sorry dude, but party's by invitation only. My name's not dude. Here to fix the toilet. [Bill] After I thoroughly wrecked that porcelain son of a bitch that is. Hey Craig! You'd better tell your friend to bring his own beer. No problem. Looks like he's carrying his own keg. [Mike] Let's tap him and imbibe his bodily essences. Just a couple of my friends come by to entertain the girls. Entertain? Shit. Hey like fix it good okay? What do you think I'm gonna do? Fix it bad? [Kevin] Well there's a 90% chance that Earl will, in fact, fix it bad. How did you come to be staying here? Sammy thought these girls were supposed to bring other girls up here. Well I kind of slipped in through a loop hole. [Bill] The "we need another victim whose grisly death we can all celebrate" loop hole. She's the one who called. She said "you got to get over and fix this toilet right now!" [Mike] His sister's Polly Holiday? If those girls wouldn't be flushing their UNsanitary napkins down the commode, wouldn't get stopped up anyway. [Bill] Oh charming. Your head's the only unsanitary thing that was clogging up the commode. [Kevin] Wait. His head is clogging up the toilet? And if so where did he get his CURRENT head? (indistinct) [Bill] Heh heh. And let THAT be a lesson to anyone who dares cross wits with Earl Coleman. Listen I was sorry to hear about your brother being sick. Well not as sorry as I am. He forgets that too much fun to fixing toilets. [Mike] Sorry to rub your life choices and your stupid should have gone to college face! Proud to entertains such a handsome little guy! Heh, entertain. Understand these two guys in here want to entertain you. [Kevin] They're rehearsing Cabaret in there right now. Had music for an hour. Mm hmm. Yelling or peering every five minutes. See what they're really trying to do is intimidate Susan and me. Well why just you two? My color for one. [Bill] My collection of Ace of Base records for two. Kind of feel left out don't you? Not really. Well I tell you one thing. They come banging on my door and I'll stick all three of their heads in there. [Mike] Susan's really stuck in a rut with a toilet thing. It's time to branch out sister. Don't worry about those guys. I'll get rid of them before I leave. And the Indian, I'll talk to him tomorrow about what's his face. [Kevin] You're our knight in shining armor repulsive homophobe. Come on squirt. I want to drive the truck! Will you shut up about the truck? You're only nine years old. Nine year old is too stupid to drive a truck. [Bill] Remember when this was a movie about ancient Toltec wizards? I got a lot of studying to do. Me too. But how can you with all this noise? [Mike] And that was Wes Craven's The Facts of Life. Hey Susan baby! How about coming in here and modeling one of your little outfits for us? You did what you wanted to do with his face. Come on in and let us do what we want to do with yours! [Kevin] Wait. I could have said that with more better grammar. Let me try again! Lay off that girl. Why? you like her, man? Come on let's think of some good watermelon jokes for mammy Tammy. Yeah. [Bill] It's racist Scattergories. Fun for the whole clan. Damn! Ain't a thing wrong with this commode. I don't understand why nobody can't fix nothing no more. [Mike] Especially stuff that's not broken as I just said this toilet isn't. One of these days you're gonna go to college. You'll study real hard. [Kevin] That kid? HE'S why there's a warning on packs of silica gel. Educated and everything. And be embarrassed about how dumb your Uncle Earl is. [Bill] Look son, he's trying to tell you he's stuck behind the toilet! [Mike] Alright, just push aside all these Dinty Moore cans. That's just fine. But I'll tell you one thing. If I ever catch you acting like one of them scrotum heads down the hall I'll beat your buns with a weed eater. [Kevin] Somewhere Adrian Peterson nods his approval. Cletis? Cletis? Cletis? (engine starts) Stop! [Bill] Stop! In the name of COPD! That kid went to pick us a six pack. Hope you don't mind. Hot damn white trash. [Mike] The pot and kettle quietly tender their resignations. Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Sounds like a stampede outside. Just like his damn daddy! [Kevin] Truck thief nine years old, wears his hat that dumb way, just like his daddy. Ah where the hell is my tool? [Bill] This guy hasn't seen his tool in YEARS! (music plays) [Mike] Back off. I'm busy not smoking this cigarette. What's that damn thing? [Bill] Carrie needs a manicure! (laughing) Drink up guys!
