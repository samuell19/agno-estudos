Don't come any closer! You're the one who said you wanted to die. l didn't say such a thing. You're an Assistant Director. Let's go to Heaven. Your parents are waiting. "Ryotaro Sakashiro" Misa Amane, your life has been extended. Are you an angel? No, a God of Death. A God of Death? Cool. Whoever's name is written on this notebook... will die. Naomi Misora shot Shiori Akino and committed suicide shortly after. Were they acquaintances? l've no idea. Wasn't Light Yagami Shiori's boyfriend? A crime of passion? Cut it out. This is a funeral. People from college? l have some questions. We're Police. Police? That's even more convenient. Leave. Isn't it strange? The Police? l feel sorry for Shiori and Light. Who said Naomi Misora was a talented FBl agent? She must have lost it when her fiance was killed. How could they still be suspecting Light? They're here. Light Yagami... the tragic hero whose girlfriend was killed. His father is Chief of the Police Department. His sister, a high school student. And Kira is involved somehow. Stop speculating. Shiori wasn't killed by Kira. How could they say such horrible things about Light? Appreciate your help. They're feeling sorry for you, Light. l'll avenge Shiori's death. l didn't want to get you involved. l'm sending Kira to the gallows. But? You're Kira. On five! Four...three... Go! Good evening. This is Saeko Nishiyama. Kiyohiko Nakayama, suspected of murder was found dead. Nakayama who allegedly killed a girl, was placed on the Wanted List. He was suddenly attacked by pain, and had collapsed in Shibuya. His cause of death was heart attack. Today was the victim's brother, Takuma's 10th birthday. My sister in Heaven must have asked Kira... to grant my birthday wish. "Let Us Unite Before Kira" "L," the mysterious detective cooperating with the lCPO... is said to have narrowed Kira down. However, there are no signs of further development. This is the lnvestigation Headquarters created by L. It hasn't been officially recognized by the Police. If you have any communication tools... please place it in here. Ryuzaki, Mr. Light Yagami is here. Ryuzaki? You go by a false name. What made you think so? Gathering from previous events, Kira needs real names to kill people. So, you do have a sharp mind. Somehow, that doesn't sound like a compliment. Are you sure you're not Kira? ls that a joke? l dislike jokes. Then why did you invite me here? If l were to die now, you'd be the first to be suspected. If you die, l'm Kira, huh? On what grounds? All the inside information has been leaking to Kira. So l had the FBl watch some people, including you. l knew l was being followed. But to my deep regret, all the FBl agents were killed. Still, we identified one suspect. The suspect who fit Kira's profile was... Me, huh? Right. That's why we had your room bugged and surveilled. That's illegal. Did my father know? It was an emergency. In that case, l should be cleared. You could have outwitted us. Naomi Misora got to you without any information from us. Enough. How could you? Light's girlfriend was just killed by that Naomi Misora. Kira can manipulate death. You mean l killed Shiori and Naomi? Why? So people would sympathize and let you on the team. To kill me. Bastard! Don't you have any feelings at all? Mr. Matsuda, l'll prove to everyone that l'm not Kira. How do you think l kill people? That's just what l can't figure out. If l knew, it would solve everything. What if all the evidence were to point to me? Your penalty is death. Checkmate. Very smooth. None of us are suspecting you. Ryuzaki was only surveilling you to eliminate every possibility. l know it was necessary. But more importantly, we should stop Kira right away. l, too hope... that you aren't Kira. l could let you see his real name... in exchange for half the years of your life. Then you could kill him on the spot. With the Prime Minister's comment affirming Kira's actions... discussions at the Diet have come to a standstill. However, young Diet members have started to support this opinion. l know... It's wrong to kill, but Nations have fought in wars and executed criminals. The question is, whether we're eliminating the right people. If you ask me, l think Kira is doing the right thing. "We Support Kira" Who made this moron a Diet member? l feel responsible for this. Tell me, Yagami. Where are you hiding our men? We need to follow L's orders. What is he? An American? l can't say. You ignorant fool! L is putting his life on the line. We believe in him. Fine. l'll get you anything; people, things, money... so catch that bastard! This Sakura TV Festival is lame. l wish some celebrity would pop in by surprise. People would go wild. No luck, l guess. Mr. Demegawa, please. Saeko's life could be at stake. You should let me do it. l'm the one who understands Kira. To tell you the truth... you just don't have it. Hi folks. l don't? Let's do it, Saeko. l'm getting goose bumps. Are you sure we don't need approval? l'm not getting fired with you. The boss wouldn't complain as long as we get good rating. This is the real Festival. This isn't a show. Who in the Hell do you think you are? Soften up a little, will ya? Suing him for sexual harassment? Stop whining and do your job. What? Commissioner. Sakura TV is broadcasting a message from Kira. "A Message from Kira" We've received two tapes from someone who calls himself "the second Kira." The second Kira? The first tape warned us about the death of a murderer, arrested recently. And as forewarned, the man died of heart attack yesterday. Please confirm. The second Kira has demanded us to run this second tape from 2:59 pm. We haven't checked the contents. As we've previously announced, if we do not obey him... he will start killing the members of Sakura TV one by one. Please understand that we are being held hostage. We are risking our lives to bring you this news. ls this happening right here? l think so. No time for Festivals now. It's now 2:59. Here's the tape. l am the second Kira. Like Kira, l am someone who wishes for a crime-free world. Whoever is opposed to Kira is my enemy. Those who interfere with Kira are letting criminals run wild. They deserve to die. Kazuhiko Hibima who is presently on Taiyou TV, will die of a heart attack. What Kira's doing is nothing but a cold-blooded murder. Put Taiyou TV on the screen! Hurry! Kira is a brutal dictator. If we let him do as he pleases, we'll be forced to become his slaves. Mr. Hibima? Mr. Hibima! Are you alright? He's dead. Please hang in there. Mr. Hibima! An ambulance! Kazuhiko Hibima had marked Kira? As evil, and criticized him. This is his punishment. Enough! We must get together and make a better future with Kira. Stop this broadcast immediately! The person in charge won't answer the phone. They're doing it for ratings. Mr. Mogi, at the scene? The future is in Kira's hands. Those of you who agree, please gather around Sakura TV. We will send Kira our voices. Kira is the only one who can clean up this world. Yeah, Kira is right! l agree. The crime rate is dropping. That critic deserved to die. People. Today is Kira's Festival! Let's go. l want to see more. Actually, l'm for Kira. You can't mean that. People, please calm down. l will not tolerate those who interfere with Kira. They will all die. Police! Mr. Mogi? Stop it! Don't approve of Kira. He's murdered millions of people. People, say no to Kira! What have the Police done for us? Kira is protecting us. No, Kira is a brutal murderer. Don't be deceived! Kira has taught us... You're all in danger. Go home! That the law is cold-hearted. Can you hear... the sorrowful cries of people who have lost their loved ones? It's Kira! Mr. Mogi! Are you alright? Can you hear... Sayu... the boisterous laughter of criminals who have escaped the law? You're in danger. Get out of here immediately! Make way. Stand back. Out of my way. Stay back. All of you, step away. What are you doing? Get out of here, quick! Kira has made a new step forward. For a better and brighter world. Give me a close-up of that guy. He's dead cold! Hey. If you go, you might get killed. You expect us to sit here and watch? This Kira could kill just by looking at the target. Warn all Police officers not to go near the scene. Ryuzaki... We must fight with Kira. But... we have to rescue Sayu. She'll be fine. He's killing people who interfere with the broadcast. Kira, if you're watching, please come here. l will promise to help you. As you may know by now, l have "the eyes." Show me your God of Death. God of Death? Such things couldn't exist. He's talking about his capability to kill. Let us unite and create a new world. Who cares about a new world? You murderer! How could you kill people so easily? What did they ever do to you? You bastard! Murderer! Don't agitate him. Murderer! Murderer... You can't do that! Somebody seems to have entered Sakura TV just now. Who could this be? Hey... that looks like... Sayu! Father? Cover your face and get inside. Mogi... We'll give you a follow up as soon as we have the details. For now, let's verify the contents of the tape. Cut all commercials! our ratings may be 30 or 40 percent! L's broadcast was 35. Get out! Are you the man in charge? Who in the Hell... Police? Stop the broadcast. But our lives are at stake. Haven't you realized you're endangering many others? Alright. Calm down, okay? Please. Yes... l understand. Ryuzaki. l've stopped the broadcast and recovered the tapes. It was him. Chief... l could never do that. Father, is Sayu alright? Light? We're both safe. Still wearing your helmet? Not anymore. l'll go. Get me permission to enter the building. Kira may see you. l'll be fine once l'm inside. The second Kira has the God of Death's eyes. An encouraging ally, huh? There's no guarantee he's not my enemy. Then why are you going? If he truly supports me, he could help me kill L. l'll find him before L does. Presently, Sakura TV has stopped their broadcasting. Taiyou TV have directed complaints to Sakura TV. They are complaining that the warning and the death of Mr. Hibima... were planned and controlled by the second Kira... Today's show has been cancelled. Yeah, no wonder. l'll get changed. Where's that Kira you keep talking about? Sayu! Light... You got me worried. Mr. Mogi... he died. That would be great. Thank you. Kira? Found ya! l knew you'd come. Yagami... Light? The postmark on the envelope tells us that it was posted from Osaka City. We've found a small print, which could mean that it's a woman's. ls this really the work of a second Kira? He could be a fake. You mean, Kira's making us think there's more of him? What's your opinion? He's not Kira. This Kira can kill with a glance. The tapes were poorly made, and he's used the media immaturely. He's too ignorant to be Kira. Besides, he's killed innocent people without hesitation. l would be angry at the bastard if l were Kira. He's made us think he was elsewhere when in fact he was inside the building. Question everyone at the TV station. If the first and second Kira get together... they'll become a great threat to the world. Mr. Yagami, could you ask the TV station to do something? What do you have in mind? "A Message from Kira: 50.5 percent!" Saeko Nishiyama is the best! Thank you. Demegawa's made a wise decision. That's really convenient. If it weren't for your research, the second Kira wouldn't have sent us his message. But they've all forgotten about you, Kiyomi. It's so unfair. Why didn't you apply for her post? l didn't want to be like her. l can't stand women who sell sex. But you're prettier. Silly. Demegawa, how did the interrogation go? Very well. l've even got us a little souvenir. What's that? A message from the Police. Great ratings guaranteed! "A Preliminary Alert" To the second Kira. If you are not yet found by Kira, we could save you. Do not go near Kira. It's obvious that he will use you and destroy you. Light Yagami... Light, not Lite. l see. Give us every information you have on Kira. Save the world from the terrors of Kira. To the second Kira... The list of the employees and others who've visited the TV station. That many? A total of... 5000 people. Let's start. Hi! My name is Misa Amane. Sayu's friend? No. l thought you might be worried... so l brought you this. Touch it. Light? She's a friend. l'm taking her to my room. Hi there. Do we have visitors? How do you do? She looks kind of familiar. She's Misamisa from "Happy Sweets." She's Misa Amane! How did you find me? l knew you hadn't traded for the eyes. Once you trade for the eyes, you can see names... but can't see the years when you have the notebook. Don't look at me. You didn't ask. Do you work at the TV station or something? l've actually become popular these days. A pop star? No, this is my first CD. l'm a model and a TV celebrity, movies, too. l'll be the main lead in the upcoming picture. How did you get my address? l searched your name on the Net and found your picture on the college site. If the Police had arrested you, Kira's secret could have gotten out. l'm sorry. But l won't get caught as long as l follow your orders. Right? l'll get L's real name. l'll be your eyes, so... So? Let me be your girl. No way. Why? They've discovered prints on the tapes. If they ever match yours, they'll know you're the second Kira. They aren't mine. l'm always extra careful with prints. l have a friend in Osaka who loves supernatural phenomenon... and we send phony tapes to TV stations. Where's your friend now? l'll kill her if you want me to. Then you'd be suspected right away. If you don't believe me, l'll hand over my notebook to you. l still have possession, so my eyes wouldn't be affected. Right, Rem? That's right. This way, l can never kill you. But you have the choice of killing me. l don't care at all if you use me. You can trust me. But why? Three years ago, Misa's family was killed by a robber. Since Misa had witnessed the robber, he was soon arrested. But her testimony was not enough to put Yoichi Tamura behind bars. Misa's heart sank deep into the shadows of darkness. Everyone had given up on her future. When one day, a miracle happened. "The Accused, Yoichi Tamura's Unnatural Death" "Could this be the work of Kira?" Kira had executed the culprit for her. That's how she's come to worship Kira. Please. Believe in me. You're my everything. But you've killed innocent Policemen. That's the same thing Tamura did to your family. How could you say such a thing? You know very well that sometimes, sacrifices are necessary. l couldn't think of any other way. And l had to see you. Alright. You've given away half your life for me. Those eyes will be my strongest weapon. l'm so happy. l'll try hard... so you'll like me. l'll arrange a meeting. Can you meet with L and find out his real name? You don't have to ask, just tell me. l'll do anything for you, Light. If we're ever caught, promise not to talk about each other or the notebook. l swear. Fine. Now, for my conditions. Go out with me once a week. Haven't you been listening to me? If L dies, we'd be free to see each other, right? He's not that easy to defeat. Besides, he suspects that l'm Kira. No! L must be real smart. But the world seem to think nothing of him. l'm working with L right now. L and Kira together? Two geniuses l'm so excited. But l need you in order to kill L, so we'll have to keep in touch. Then once a week wouldn't hurt. If l start dating you... l'd have to date other girls too, so people wouldn't get suspicious. You can't! If l see you with another girl, l might kill her. l'm the one you're dating! You want me to get rid of you? l won't allow that, Light Yagami. l'll never forgive you if something happens to her. l know how long she has left. If she dies before that, l'll know it's you. If l ever find out you're up to something... l'll send you to Hell. Ryuzaki? We've heard nothing from the second Kira since the incident. He may have contacted Kira. Aren't you covering your face? If you were Kira, l'd be in trouble. It would be fatal if you had already informed the second Kira about me. In which case... l'll wear this. l see. Keeping an eye on me? You think Kira's a student, huh? l'm waiting for a big catch. You mean, Kira? Light! l dropped by to say hi. You... ls he... a friend of yours? Yeah. His name is Ryuzaki. That's a weird mask. Take it off. Hello. Mister... Ryuzaki? How do you do? l'm Misa Amane. He gives me the creeps. He's just shy. l envy you, Light. l'm a great fan! Oh really? Thanks. Tell me, Light. How do you date stars? l made the first move. Misa... Isn't that Misamisa? Oh yeah! She's cute! What's she doing here? You're all the smartest students in Japan, right? Shake my hand! Who pinched my bottom? This is an outrage! l, the famous detective will find the culprit. For you. You're funny. Would you go out with me instead? My one and only love is Light! Cut it out. l still have class. You go back to work. Okay. Sorry, but l had to see you. Later, Light. Wasn't Misamisa pretty? Ryuzaki. So now you know. See you. Right. Now that l've met Misamisa, l'll go back to headquarters. Be careful. l've won! "Misa Amane" Hello? What are you doing? Someone seems to have dropped this phone. That's Misa's. Give it back. Calling her already? You two must be love birds, or... Was there something so urgent you had to ask? Yes? We've captured the target. The target moved around and showed up unexpectedly. We're taking the target to headquarters. Understood. Thank you. We've captured Misa Amane on suspicion of being the second Kira. Misa Amane is a Kira fanatic, and was at the TV station that day. Fragments found on the tapes matched those from her clothes. Powders from her makeup, too. This information is strictly confidential. Meanwhile, please refrain from coming to headquarters. What kind of interrogation? l cannot tell. Would you mind handing over her phone? Misa's the second Kira? That's impossible. Too bad! This must be your unlucky day. See you. Ryuzaki. ls this really necessary? The second Kira can kill with a glance. Strict surveillance is absolutely vital. If she doesn't turn out to be Kira, we're criminals. We have evidence. It's clear she's hiding something. Why else would she keep quiet? Have Amane's production company say to the press, she's hospitalized. That's already done. By the way, Amane and Light have a close relationship. What? She's even visited your home. Light... We'd better contact Rem before Misa starts talking... or we're in big trouble. A God of Death can't leave the human who possesses the Death Note. Unless that human gives it up... or dies. Misa in Confinement Day 2 She hasn't eaten for two whole days. She must have some nerve. l'm starting to like her. l might buy her CDs. Moron. l need to pee. Let me use the bathroom. Kira's executions haven't stopped. Misa in Confinement Day 5 Misa. Please start talking. We don't want to torture you. Tell us what you know about Kira. l can't stand it anymore. Kill me... Please! This is too much! Can you hear me? Please... Kill me. Do you admit that you're the second Kira? Who cares about a second Kira? l can't stand this. l'd rather die. Please. Kill me now! l know you have the powers to do it! l was supposed to die with my family anyway. l don't mind at all. Let me die while l'm still young. Kill me! Rem... l've made Misa give up the Death Note. She begged me to kill her because she didn't want to trouble you. Don't you see, Light Yagami? She's doing this all for you. Misa... She's now lost her memory of the Death Note. Along with the fact that she's killed people and that you're Kira. When l explained to Misa that all she'd remember was the love for you... she said, she didn't ask for more. You must save Misa. or else l will have to kill you. Misa's lucky to have a God of Death on her side. l've made a promise to Jealous. Jealous? Jealous had always been watching Misa. When her parents died, he felt he had to be her guardian. Until one day, her life was about to end. Jealous did something a God of Death was forbidden to do. He wrote the name of the attacker, and prolonged Misa's life. Gods of Death are supposed to take lives from humans. But instead, he gave her life and had become disqualified. Jealous was turned into sand. Leaving me to take care of Misa in his place. That's how Jealous' notebook was passed on to Misa. A God of Death dies falling in love with a human. Sounds romantic. l'll kill you if you don't save Misa. You're boring me with that same line, Rem. If l die, it would break Misa's heart. She may even commit suicide. A God of Death should know. l'll take time... but l know of a sure way. If l do as l'm told Misa will be saved? Why don't you trust me? He's very careful, you know. l'll believe you. Light Yagami, take care of Misa. Burying my Death Note? l'm just hiding it. When l decide to abandon it, l'll use the words, "throw away." "Throw away," huh? Misa in Confinement Day 6 Mr. Stalker, l'll forgive you if you let me go right now. l'll give you my autograph and a kiss. So please, let me out of here! She's been repeating this since she's recovered consciousness. We're not stalkers, we're the Police. The Police wouldn't do such a thing. Even l know that. Then why have you keep silent up till now? How should l know? l was just waiting for Light when l got abducted. Then you do know Light Yagami. Sure, he's my boyfriend. She's changed. How did you meet him? l saw him at Sakura TV and fell in love. l found out his address and went to his house. ls that a crime? She'd never said a word about Light before this. Why talk now? Wasn't it Ryuzaki who prohibited cell phones? Yeah. Hello. Please come in. Keep recording but hide the monitors. A visitor? Light. l've already talked to Ryuzaki. l could be Kira. What are you saying? l always believe that criminals deserve to die. It's possible that l'm Kira. It could be anyone. Are you protecting Amane? l've only started seeing her so l don't know her so well. But Misa can't be the second Kira. As for myself, l'm not aware of being Kira but... if l have a subconscious personality, l want you to find out. We didn't find anything. But last time, we didn't surveil Light outside of his room. Then, we'll tie him up and confine him. Let's observe him 24 hours a day. That's fine with me. But what happens... if there's another execution by Kira while l'm in confinement? We'll let you go. Thank you. Light. Are you sure? Where's Light? What's happened to him? Father, answer us. Please! "The Compendium of Laws" "Dear Light, on your 18th birthday." This is a rulebook created along with the history of justice. Thanks Father. l'll study more about justice. Misa in Confinement Day 8 Light in Confinement Day 3 Tell me. Has someone been killed? Actually, no criminals have been killed so far. Not a single soul. l see. That would make me even more suspicious. This is boring. Can't eat apples, can't talk to you. l wonder what Rem's doing. "Saeko Nishiyama" Damn... l can't find my pass. Anybody found it? Keep quiet. l've brought you something you've longed for. Misa in Confinement Day 12 Light in Confinement Day 7 Let me see him, Mr. Stalker. Light, you look tired. How are you doing? l feel miserable. But this pride of mine... l must "throw away." Did you say, "throw away"? You'll lose your memory. See ya, Light. So long. Ryuzaki What is it? l'm the one who volunteered to do this, but now l know for sure. This is a waste of time. l'm not Kira. That's not for you to decide, Light. How could l be so brutal without acknowledging it? Don't you think so? You were the one who suggested it to us... in the first place. My time on confinement has made me realize the truth. Ryuzaki, we'll find a way somehow. Together, we'll seize Kira by the neck. He's suddenly become positive. Misa in Confinement Day 19 Light in Confinement Day 14 Light's aware of what he's doing, but as for Misa... She's tough. l'd have gone nuts by now. Ryuzaki. Kira's back. They're dying of heart attacks. Light. There's been no executions for two weeks now. Start confessing. Hey! The first is l am being wrongly accused. l'm not Kira, believe me! Why did Kira choose me? You predicted how Kira chose his victims and pulled a scoop. You must have felt something special. l sympathized with the way Kira dealt with the criminals. That's what l felt. Kira is aiming for a crime-free world. We should let the world know how rightful he is. If l were Kira, l'd use the media. That's exactly why... Kira chose you to be his partner. l'm Kira's Partner! "More Heart Attacks" Misa in Confinement Day 23 Light in Confinement Day 18 Criminals are being killed incessantly. How could they kill unknown criminals when they're being confined? What if... Kira's special powers were passed on to a third Kira? Leaving the two deprived of their memories. But how could we prove that? Ryuzaki. Let's start from scratch. How do you feel? l'm fine. You've put up with it very well. We still have to check Amane's room... so stay under our surveillance until the case is solved. If l'm being surveilled, l may as well join you guys in the investigation. l was going to ask you to. You can cooperate by staying with me 24 hours a day. Thank you. We'll capture Kira. l love you, Light... Ms. Wakita, are you alright? Ambulance! She's gone. Masako Wakita, accused of murdering her co-worker... had been on the run. Could this be another execution by Kira? We had just arranged a meeting with the suspect, Masako Wakita... when we came upon this incident. Kiyomi, it must have been a shock for you. Having no history of illness, she may have been killed by Kira. Please take a look at this chart. This is a survey conducted for a thousand people. It shows that 60 percent of them support Kira. That number's surprising. l don't' think so. Not when we consider the fact that crime rate is dropping due to Kira. our queen is furious. Kira is in fact fighting against crime. What is the meaning of justice? Do we really need the Police? Kira is asking us. Easy for them to say. l wouldn't blame them. It's true that we haven't got anything on Kira yet. That doesn't sound like you. Thanks a lot. Good bye. You were good today. Thank you. Our Director is thinking of promoting you to anchorwoman. The viewers are loving the way you're dealing with the Kira incident. Maybe you've had it all along. Mr. Demegawa. There's a fly here and it's getting on my nerves. Bring me some insect spray. Saeko, let's have a meal. Kiyomi, you do your own part. And l'll do mine. No one's asking for your opinion. Let's go. She's too mediocre to become a newscaster. We're only employees here. We don't have a say in it. But you're the one who broadcasted Kira's video. Did you sleep with her? You're the only woman who'd do anything to get a promotion. Stop the car. l'm getting off! Just you wait. l'll get even. Hey, calm down already. What's the matter? You won't find a taxi here! Good morning. Hello. Good evening. This is Kiyomi Takada, your newscaster. Tonight, we must bring you this unfortunate news. Our anchorwoman, Saeko Nishiyama died in an accident last night. She was a talented newscaster. Someone to admire and look up to. It's ironical that my first job... had to be the announcement of her death. She will be missed. We're like newlyweds. If possible, l prefer not to work again. But l'd die if they put me back in that stuffy cell. Sorry. Light, are you studying? Misa, let me have some time alone. l'll be downstairs. But l'm lonely. Come back soon. l know it's hard, but be patient. Ryuzaki's feeling down. Because he found out Kira wasn't Light? You guys are so troublesome. Ryuzaki. Tell me. How probable is it that l'm Kira? The probability that you are Kira is almost zero. l see. l'm relieved to know that. l, too am glad that you're not Kira. But now that's cleared we're back where we've started. What would you say if l told you l've found a clue? When will you come back? What kind? Look at this. These red and blue dots represent... the killings before and after l was confined. Does this mean that there's only one Kira? But there seems to be a slight difference. You're right. It's impossible to copy someone else's actions exactly. One cannot hide one's true nature. Ryuzaki... You've lightened up. That's the spirit. If there were only one Kira, the patterns wouldn't change as much. It's most likely that the first Kira and the new Kira are different people. Ryuzaki, is your appetite back? Yes, thanks to you. What's the factor? The first factor is communication. The new Kira has killed more suspects taken up by the media. The second factor is gender. The new Kira seems to be more interested in issues concerning women. This Kira could be female. And for the third factor. This may actually be the answer. Go on and tell us. It's the numbers of times a certain media took up the incidents. Which media is that? Sakura TV. Let me summarize. The new Kira compared to the original Kira... has something to do with the media, and is a woman. And Sakura TV... A newscaster has just been replaced! Keeping a diary in a common notebook? Would a popular newscaster do such an average thing? She's copying something down from her computer. Give me a close-up of the notebook. Just a moment. What's this? The names of criminals recently killed by Kira. Mr. Sanami, please find out their names and confirm. Right away. You kill everyday. Don't you ever run out of people to kill? There are so many sinful people. How about you? l know. l'm the most sinful. But even still, l must continue. Talking to herself? No, she's talking to somebody. We've confirmed. The names on the left hand side are of the criminals who died yesterday. The times and causes of deaths, even the ones unannounced are on it. Bingo. Chief, let's arrest Takada. She'll say she was just taking memos. You're right. One more thing. All the criminals whose names are being written on the right hand side... are still alive. They may be the next victims. If they die tomorrow, Takada is Kira. Or she may be giving orders to Kira somehow. We can't wait for that to happen. What should we do? Use Kira's contemptibility. Ms. Takada. l know how you've managed to pull big scoops about Kira. l've discovered your secret. What? l've been monitoring your room. That's a crime. Your secret lies in that black notebook of yours. l'll sell you the tape for 5 million yen. The criminals who died today, and the names written yesterday have matched. Takada's the one. She's Kira. Here. "Reporter, Yosuke Matsuo" If something ever happens to me, the tape will be exposed. Are you in on this alone? Of course! My account number's on the back of my card. Put 5 million in there. l'll give you the tape as soon as l get the money. Goodbye. It's me. Take a look at Sakura TV. What is it? Just switch it on. Kira's a woman? "Kira Unveiled" This tape will prove everything. Not so fast. We'll show it at the very end of the program. It's now an hour and 25 minutes before we know who Kira is. Until then, Mr. Mahina will... They've gotten ahead of us. l'll call you back. Satisfied? You're a good actor. Let's see. Yosuke Matsuo, suicide. At 22:36, cancels his TV appearance and disposes all evidence. Jumps off a building and dies. See what she's writing? She can manipulate death. That was a close, Rem. Close? What does she mean? Does she think Matsuda will do as she's written in her notebook? She's very attractive. Are you for or against Kira? Do you think l'd expose her if l were for Kira? Aren't you scared? The time's already passed. Rem, how could this be? Rem? Who's Rem? Who is she talking to? God of Death? Yosuke Matsuo... it must have been a false name. A God of Death should know. Why didn't you tell me? Could this "God of Death" be some kind of code? Under these circumstances, it could be a real God of Death. What? okay, let's make a deal. Give me your eyes. God of Death's eyes... As the second Kira said... with the God of Death's eyes, one could kill with a glance. Headquarters. Take extra care. Takada can kill just by looking. Got it. Stop the vehicle. Open up. Your license. Driver's license. l can't let you get away with it. Genta Shidohara. How do you know my name? You're... l've seen you on TV. What was the name of the TV station? You're the newscaster. Hey you... Stop! A Police officer's down but l can't rescue him. Roger. Did she kill with the eyes? We can't have her running wild. We haven't got enough evidence but we'll arrest her anyway. Freeze, Takada! Who are you? Stop! What? Let me go! Get off! We've been surveilling your every move. The program you've been watching was a fake. So it was a trap. Takada. How did you kill these people? Are you the Police? How did you kill as Kira? You were writing names. What happens then? l just write them. Answer the question! Why don't you try it? You can kill... Just by writing a name on this notebook. What in the world is this?! What is it? Whoever touches it can see the God of Death. Ryuzaki, let me try. Light... are you alright? l'm fine. l've won. Just as l'd planned. My memory will come back when l touch the Death Note. However, if it's a notebook you've never actually used... your memory will only last while you have it in your hand. But if l were to possess it, l will never lose my memory. To do that... you must kill the former owner while your memory's back. Excellent. That's all l needed to hear. Rem. Give this Death Note to someone who will be Kira's successor. Have that person resume the killings, 13 days from now. Anyone at all? It'll be impossible for you to find the new Kira. l know what l'm capable of doing. l'm sure l'd want to find where the new Kira is. l may even find this Death Note before L does. By the way, there's something l want you to add to the notebook. What is it? A fake rule that l've made for the Death Note. Gods of Death do exist. That answers all our questions. Whoever's name is written on this notebook dies. Isn't that right? God of Death and a notebook that kills... Kiyomi Takada. Who in the world would believe in such things. There's no way we can put her on trial. Exactly. All l did was write names on a notebook. Wrong. If we can prove how this works... you'll be sentenced to death! Humans, hear me! l am Rem, the God of Death. Whoever touches the notebook sees me, and l see the years you'll live. l can always take away your lives. So it's best not to make me angry. Within the Death Note lies my special powers. Whoever's name is written on the notebook, will indeed die. "Kiyomi Takada" So, one can manipulate the situation of death as well. Write down that woman's name and find out for yourself. Rem, no! Hey, Takada! She's dead. Give me the notebook. What could have been the cause of Takada's death? A coincidental heart attack, suicide, or... the work of another Kira. Which is it? Who knows? There were no names of criminals who were killed before Light was confined. What do you think? Maybe the former owner dies Whenever it's passed on to others. Both Kiras may already be dead. Now that Takada's dead, it's in the hands of someone else. ls that it? Who knows? Who's the owner of this Death Note? l can't answer that. ls that all you can say? By the way... about the last rule written on the Death Note... Once the owner writes a name, he must write another in 13 days or he will die. Gathering from this, the first Kira may already be dead. We've confined Light for 18 days, and Misa 23 days, which means... they're both innocent. God of Death. Are all the rules on the notebook authentic? Sure they are. We'll stop their surveillance. Call your mother, Light. Father, let me help you with the investigation. l believe l need to do it. Light... Ryuzaki, l know you need me. Alright. Light will continue the search with us. It looks so ordinary. How could this thing kill people? Why aren't you coming with me? Come visit me anytime. Ryuzaki should let you in up to the entrance. Then l'll come see you everyday. Misa, listen to me quietly. Do me a favor. Anything. Found it. So Kira was Light. He's my God! l'm so happy. l'm glad Light's Kira. l'm back at last, baby! Ryuk! Why are you here? The notebook you have is mine, so l'm your God of Death. If you become the owner, you won't lose memory of the Death Note. Then l'll be the owner. Oh yes! This is from Light. Wow, an apple! Ain't it thoughtful of him? Misa. By the time you read this, your memory would have come back. To make an ideal society, you must restart the execution. By the way, do you remember the man l introduced to you at college? Ryuzaki is indeed our enemy, L. Who? Him? You must have seen Ryuzaki's real name. Write his name on the Death Note and send him to his grave. Send L to his grave... Damn it! l can't remember. l used to see so many people's names everyday. You lose "the eyes" when you abandon the Death Note. What a pity, Misa. Ryuk. l want "the eyes" again. Are you sure? Do you really want to lose another half of our life? l have no choice! How could l ever face Light? Face? He likes your face. You don't understand. l guess l don't, but l can tell you're pretty desperate. l am. l must do as l'm told. A week from Takada's death... a new Kira seems to have started killing criminals. So, there are other Death Notes. It happened as soon as Misa was set free. There you go again. What about the 13-day rule? Mr. Yagami. Yes? We should have the Death Note tested. l'll ask the FBl to find two criminals on death row. We'll have criminal A write criminal B's name on the notebook... and then have criminal A write nothing at all for 13 days. You treat their lives as if they were nothing. There are many more lives we should be thinking about. No other way? There's been a large number of killings today. Sacrifices have become inevitable. Let me be the witness of the experiment. That's my condition. Father... Thank you for understanding. l'll fly to America. On your own? Let me come with you. No. You wait here with Ryuzaki. Matsuda is incompetent, but l'll take him and some others along. l may be incompetent, but l'm good with guns. How about up here? Incompetent. First of all, you will go to the Tokyo Bay Heliport. From Yokota, a transport plane will fly you all the way to Washington. Watari has arranged everything. Fine. l'll be off. Alone at last. What are you up to? Soon, Watari will be here with Amane. l knew it. Why Misa? For some reason, the 13-day rule didn't apply to Amane. Which means she is the second Kira, and that she now has the other Death Note. l firmly believe so. Then Misa would have written our name on the notebook when she got free. It's most likely that she forgot my name during her confinement. Women are good at forgetting. l will reveal my face to Amane once more. What? But then... Grab her as soon as she starts writing my name. We need to get hold of her second Death Note. But she may write it anywhere. We have surveillance cameras all over the building. She may not even bring it. She will. This is her biggest opportunity to kill me. Alright. After l grab her, we'll confine her and ask where the first Kira is. This time we have proof so she'll be forced to talk. l see why you've sent my father away. If we confine Misa this time, she may really die. But sacrifices are necessary. God of Death? Mr. Ryuzaki doesn't suspect me of being the second Kira anymore, right? Right you are. But what will happen if l fail to save you? When my heart stops, Mr. Yagami will be informed by a special sensor. Whereupon the Death Note will be burnt and disposed of forever. Misa's life has been shortened again. Her life? What do you mean? Ryuzaki. l'm willing to risk my life, too. Let's catch the second Kira, Misa. Here she comes. Light Yagami, you had been waiting for this to happen. Ever since l told you we'd die if we prolonged human lives. You've put her in danger so l'd have to save her. Now l must prolong her life and turn myself to sand. You've had this planned out all along. You must be a real Devil to want a God of Death dead. And Misa is in love with such a man. But Light Yagami, l'll never let you have this Death Note. Misa... Enjoy your happiness while it lasts. Watari? Checkmate. You've used the God of Death... Rem is a gentle God of Death. Light Yagami... So you were Kira. You could've told me your name. Half-wit! l've made... a mistake... So long, L. You've been a good rival to Kira, a God of the new world. With a single mistake, l could have been the one to die. To set Misa free... and to have her use the Death Note turned out to be a risk. You watch my revolution succeed. Good bye, L. l see. Rem got rid of it. Light, you did it! The Death Note. Here. Did you kill L? Long time no see. l've won, but l have some unfinished business. "Soichiro Yagami" "Heart Attack" That's your father's name! It's all for a higher cause. But... He's your father. Why? Keep quiet. There are times when you have to make sacrifices. There's no going back now. "Brings back the Death Note hands it to a pursuer and dies." Father... Give me the Death Note. Father. l've always been proud of you. You hate injustice, and try to be a good example to others. l still respect that. So l know... that you'd understand what l'm about to do. Father. l'm sorry. Your time's up. Where is it? Light. l've watched everything. And heard every single word you've said. What? Light! Light. You're under arrest. Light. l'm sorry we couldn't be friends. Ryuzaki. You... How did you? Was it a fake? You've betrayed me! Never! Why would l ever betray you? l don't care if you're a Devil in disguise. l love you all the same! Amane hasn't betrayed you. l didn't imagine you'd use the God of Death. This is the real one. The Death Note Amane dug out. And this is my real name you've been longing to know. "Dies peacefully of heart failure, 23 days later." One cannot change what's already written. So l've decided to write in it first. l only have 20 more days to live, but you can't kill me with the notebook. When did you switch them? The criminals l've written have all died! Only the first day. This is how we found out you were the second Kira... and that the 13-day rule was a fake. From the second day, Watari switched them. We had her surveilled... and had the killings covered on the news as if they were being done by Kira. There was no evidence that told us you were Kira. You were always extra careful. So l... gave up my own life. In order to carry out my plan, l needed Mr. Yagami's help. At first, he was strongly opposed to it. But when l showed him the Death Note with my name on it... he finally gave in. He decided to go with my plan. Mr. Yagami refused to believe you were Kira... up till the very last moment. Instead of going to the Heliport... your father and his men stayed here and watched everything. l'm sorry l couldn't protect Watari. l didn't think the God of Death would write his name. My last mistake. Light. You said l would understand what you're doing for the world. But l don't get it at all. This is far from justice! Before l had the notebook... this rotten world was full of unpunished criminals. But Kira changed all that. The crime rate dropped by 70 percent. Wasn't that the kind of world you had wished for all your life? Light! You had a piece of Death Note hidden with you. That's how Takada was killed. This case is solved. l am indeed Kira. God of the new world. No, you're just a murderer. And this notebook is the deadliest weapon on Earth. L, you have no idea what's going on out there. Innocent people are falling victim to evil bastards. There are worthless people who shouldn't be living at all. The law is powerless before them! The law isn't perfect. Neither are the people who've created it. But it's been made with the endless effort to do good. What you've done is selfish. Killing people isn't the answer. This is a waste of time. Ryuk? Where are you? Here. Another God of Death. You've all touched the notebook so you can see. Ryuk. l'll show you something more interesting. So kill them. Kill all of them! Light... What's the matter? Go on and write a name. A name, huh? Stop. It's no use. Ryuk, have you finished? Yep. Let me see. Here you are. "Light Yagami" Who told you, you could lean on me? You're done. Wait, l still have something you'll enjoy! l've enjoyed enough. Haven't you? What do you mean? The fun's only beginning! Humans who've used the Death Note can't go to Heaven or to Hell. What awaits them after death is... Nothingness. Light! Why, Ryuk? l can't afford to die now. Light! Why? All l wanted to do was justice. The true justice you've taught me. You can't let me die like this! Kira is justice. Father, you've got to understand. Light... Light. Fool... You damn fool! l'll dispose all the Death Notes. Aren't you using it? How boring! l've reported everything... except about the God of Death. l told the lCPO everything, but they didn't believe me. They've decided not to announce Kira's death. Light was killed by Kira. ls that how the story goes? That's what l'll tell my wife and daughter. Amane has lost her memory again. Because l've burnt both Death Notes. Ryuzaki. What shall l say? l'm sorry l'm the one to apologize. l've risked a lot of lives, even your son's. Ryuzaki. It was an honor to have worked with you. My time's almost up. l'd like to be alone. Actually... l've never had parents. But Mr. Yagami, l know you must have been a great father. Ryuzaki... Good bye, Mr. Yagami. l thank you. A YEAR LATER It's been so long since l've made Light's birthday cake. We started buying them when he entered school. l remember asking him if l could blow out the candles. Light let you blow them out. He was such a gentle boy... Mother, it's snowing! Take an umbrella to your father. Father! You didn't have to. Can l come in? Crimes have increased since Kira disappeared. Do you want Kira to come back? Never... he's killed Light. Light fought with Kira up to the very end. l know. Happy birthday. l seem to have forgotten something very important. But... l can't remember what it was. Light...
