Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz The author of "Farewell to Autumn" was the most extraordinary and the most versatile artistic character in the first half of 20th century Poland Philosopher and erotomaniac Extravagant dandy, painter and writer He felt equally well at philosophical debates As in the salons where he was famous as dancer and Adolf Hitler's voice imitator His works were compared to lunatic dreams One could not find the sense in his his prophetic and vibrating visions A novel "Farewell to Autumn" was written in 1926 It is a tongue in cheek analysis of the society on the verge of destruction It is a story about the chaos which brought to us 100 millions inhabitants of Central Europe the fate of being slaves of only one and "rightful" idea: The communism halo Is this Hela Bertz?

One more moment like that and I will convert to communism Please, fetch me a priest for 9 o'clock In the afternoon the whole family is baptized Or I will shoot myself I'll have my supper in bed Stop! Tazio! Tazio, forgive me The Prince was faster than you I couldn't refuse him Only if for the very perversion of serving to your enemy Bullets can be exchanged twice The Prince shoots first To the first blood At dawn I have seen everything You know, Tazio I didn't know you were so vile Please, tell me at once that you love me Yes.. - Mother didn't see you? - No I like you so much today so I'd tear you to shreds Why are so strange? Strange? Strange I had some business to do and I didn't manage all Zosia Yes? Somehow I don't believe you today Do you think, all is so simple that you, me and Mother will be sitting down and writing a little book? That I can live like that hand in hand? Tazinku Hell, how do you know that I love you? Maybe I throw up all over it? - Do you throw up? - Yes, I do Just with human touch And I hate you with pure, beautiful hate And because of only that I want to marry you. What? - I will forgive you a lot - That's good Because I love you like a hell Poor, overcomplicated boy I can not loose you I can not I challenged him A duel due tomorrow at dawn I know my dignity, you... Have you wanted to say something, Kuba? Did you? When I... - When I... - Well I may forgive a lot But tell me: yes or no No I only wish to know - No - No So, everything call be called off Don't you even dare Come here to me Hela Don't you see it? I can be killed tomorrow But this is the last, and the only meaningful moment of my life Hela! Hela! Morning Gentlemen, it's not serious The sick are waiting for me - Shoot down all! -Let someone bring him. - Not needed Comrade Count hasn't read the newspapers for a long time? All is hanging in balance and if only it starts The moderates and socialism are the almost the logical opposites I don't understand anything I don't All around there are strong, healthy boors waiting to get at our lives Easy, easy It must burst out Burst out? Is it necessary? - Never More a golf club I'll shoot him and we'll have peace What if prince doesn't come? Then, you'll fetch him here by force Get out! Quickly! Quickly! With one move, stand here, fast Miss, quickly, your Papa arrived Hela! Hela! Hela! Hela, what is this loafer doing in your bed? - How does he dare? - This is my fiance - We've just done American trial - What trial? What fiance? I have for you two great marquises. Italian fascists Mr Bertz, in Italy there are as many marquises as dogs Shut up! I thought you'd carry on the greatness of Bertz's family - And you bring me this zero -Mr Bertz, today I have duel with Bazakbal Bazakbal - another zero Could it be bigger zero than zero? Why did I invite this scum to my home? Why? Why? Papa doesn't understand anything Papa! Prince is fighting for me For my honor If he survives, the day after tomorrow, we'll marry - What marriage? - I convert to Catholicism today - What! - Papa should do the same if only for business Right. But what if he dies? No harm! Just in case I have used right pills Hela! What are doing to me? I have full hands with a coup Do you what's going in city? I barely managed to withdraw money - You devil - Later on, later Go away Go away You knave, you should have asked me first for her hand Rather than rape my daughter like a whore in my own house Not nice! Do you understand, you boor? Careful Mr Bertz! Or if I warm up I'll challenge you as well Praised be God My God! What time is it? Let Papa make the carriage ready. I don't understand anything. Or maybe nothing to understand here? Maybe it is just a big hole in a sky? So, you called for me again, you unruly daughter Let's go! I don't even know how the barrel looks like They will show you everything there But I have very poor eyesight No one wants you to shoot to the match. Bazakbal is a big fellow But I can't stand the view of blood No one orders you to look at blood You just should shoot him down! And that's what I was afraid of Tazio, wake up. Prince has arrived Hela This is barrel, trigger, viewfinder. Upon command you press - Where to? Handkerchief - Here is mine - Be the man. -Easy to say for you - You don't know how difficult Prince is shooting the first Mr Bazakbal the second Look what a hero! We'll get drunk like swines afterwards Quiet! No panic! Nothing! He just fainted So, we need to talk We don't have any rancor to Mr Bazakbal anymore Shoot! To the first blood! Father, you know Sometimes I think about melting away about disappearing I love life but sometimes I get such a sorrow Everything is passing too fast Wouldn't be better to steer it myself? Only at the decision moment, the world seems to be the illusion of the completeness Tazio! Tazio! Tazio! - What's your name my daughter? - Helena - Helena what do you demand from God's church? - The faith - They are not her yet? - They'll be on time - Listen - For sure they can not get through - Do you hear? What a silence. What kind of moment. They are coming! If only it could last like that. Forever A moment after the moment Helena! Do you renounce evil spirit? - I renounce - Helena! Do you know what faith provides you with? Eternal life - Bruizor already mobilized the army - What? - Bruizor already mobilized the army - A rumor -The action will start at night He wants to surprise the revolutionaries -Nothing will happen. -Russians are retreating. - No one takes communism seriously - Look out - Get down - Come on An hour of judgment has come In front of us the idea is dying The great idea The idea of free individual Pretensions and crimes are the new foundations of the world The world born out of sin The world of dwarfed mankind Let the righteous ones close their eyes And I will not not leave you till the death And I will not not leave you till the death Don't you think we could better cross those pairs? Bertz, you lost your mind Not that much. A terrible fate awaits those four To the entrance! Stop! Where are they? Come here, come Faster On your knees! On your knees! You are standing here, facing the God Yes, yes, that's good. No. Quiet please, Silence please You're safe! Old Bertz took the situation completely under control Revolution will be suppressed in blood And now: let's play. The band start play! Very good We're going to pack up. Quickly We've reached the endpoint of bourgeois culture which didn't produce anything but doubt in everything I am so glad to meet you finally - Do you hear that Tazio? - These men are stupid bunch Who am I seeing? How could you have a duel for such a trifle as poking on a street? I was angry with Kuba, because he landed up so well I wanted so badly to nurse him - I envied you so much that Atanazy - It's me who envies you everything You know I am Jewish They hate me for that and are frightened Will we have a drink? Let's go I'm here incognito. If needed I will even become communist for the disguise. I'm going to the underground Intelligentsia will not be executed, only supplanted And you watch out. You'll burn out completely. - And then you'll commit suicide. That'll be the end. -Pity There is no other way Idealism within Marxism was so far masked too much The happiness is equal to being well fed - Existence of cattle - And cattle has just awaken I wonder how the cocaine trade will be organized after the upheaval - What? -Coke, coke, coke coke, coke, coke I know you're communist But all of that... No What if I fell in love with Atanazy? What if? My little bird. I am frightened. You're beautiful. Do you know what you have? You don't know what you have Do you know what I have done to her? Do you? I can tell you. With all the details. She sat upon me, that her leg was... But maybe you feel offended? - What should I do? - Excuse me! Do what you like to! I have to take her from you. It will be splendid. A catastrophe scaled up to our epoch It'll be really something. A total annihilation I always feared such nice things What if I took him from you? I'd kill you - What? - I know you are extremely unhappy More than me. More than Hela. More than the whole world Tazio! You should watch after your loved one She's vomiting. In the corner over there. -A pussy -I am so gifted! 24, 25, 26... Hela! We have to talk -Not now Papa -Hela! Papa, leave me A great party! You're so pretty Mrs, and you Mrs and you Gentlemen too. Let's play Wonderful! Pretty! My lovely! Tazio! Tazio! Tazio! Hold me! I can't live without you. I can't My pearl, my beloved froggie Let's dance! I want you to understand once for good that I don't crave for anything extraordinay I'm Zosia's husband and I demand that you understand it at last Hela! Hela! Hela! You should be packing now There is already cannon fire in the city I got a phone call. The heaps of dead. New government. Good God! All factories nationalized - Hela! What's going on with you? - Nothing, nothing at all Money. You have them in the bank. In the passport there is Swiss visa. Here is that stamp. What's that? Jozia maiden is cleaning the bathtub. You can talk What can I say? You have to go. - The last train is leaving in the morning. - The Atanazys will travel with me. What are you saying? What for? They want to wait it out too. Send the telegram. You know it better. You're very wise. I love you so such. I have only you! I'll send the luggage to the station. Bye My blood. Bye - Bye - Papa! I need a torturer as hot and hard as the sword taken out of the fire And you don't look like a sword You have to conquer me. Do you get it? Otherwise, don't show up in my house again If you think this mockery impresses me than you're wrong You're 3rd class slut at best A little metaphysics whore aspiring to the higher class It doesn't impress me at all. And I guarantee you Oh no, this is simply nonsense This is trivial, trivial! Please, put the fire out. No, this is like cinema. Make the way! Silence! Silence! Bruizor already broke down. Revolution! Move in, move in Which ones are ours? Those ones. - No, these are not ours. - A pity, he's so handsome. Move on! Clear the way! I am on fire - Aim! Fire! - We're polish army Fire! - I think he's dead - Amen Do you understand now? There is no world There are neither bodies nor souls We'll die together Come You are You are This is a miracle. Don't say anything. Don't say anything Beyond good and evil In the very center -Even beyond the death's realm. -Don't say anything. I love you, I love you An absolute unity. And this voice that connects and divides at the same time A paradise. He's not in. Only us. Do you understand? Only us. Only us together. - Only us. Let it last forever. You understand! -Yes Get on the train. Get on! Close the door! Please. Get on! Please. What's now? -He's nowhere seen. Help me. I am not going anywhere without him I am getting off. Bogus do something! - After all you are the man. -Hela! I asked you many times not to talk like that. -Run after him! -But where to? -I don't where. -I will kill myself! -Call Lohoyski! -Yes, yes! - They'll kill me - Let them rather kill me Or I kill you if you won't fetch him now! Hela! You don't love me anymore! - I'll go for him - No, I'll do that myself - Fast, fast! - Dear, one moment! I am Persian Prince I have to make a call - You have to help me! - Ok, ok, I understand. Quickly. Get on! Yes? But, why everywhere? The phone has been just switched off He's here. Where are you? What time is it? Just, just wait for us. We'll join you in a moment. I stay here. Don't fool around. They are waiting for us -at the station -I have terrible hallucinations Get a grip on yourself! -Jedrek, this cow of yours. -You came on the other side, you will not return to Zosia, I know it - Listen to me! If you once again - Quiet! Don't say anything! I beg you. Take this, I have finished with this stuff I won't take it anymore! You will. I know it. Because I love you - Listen, Jedrek - Tazio I have only you. And even this you want to take away from me Jedrek, don't make a demoniac woman out of me. You go to the mountains to get rest You don't know anything. You have no idea what opens for me What kind of unknown horizons - Jedrek... - What kind of unknown perspectives - This is the last train. -You never accept the futility of the world without it Don't fool around. We have to run! No we don't. We don't have to do anything I am sorry for those who still believe in something while being at the bottom themselves Tazio, forgive me I'm tired. I have to rest. A man in love is dying Listen, maybe I... - Stop! -Excuse me my express is leaving at 7 - Which express train? Your papers? - Yes, I am Bazakbal - But, do you have papers? -I'm sorry, my train is leaving. -Show us please How dare you to touch me? Who are you? How dare you? - Please come here. - This is your bloody obligation! - This gentleman stays here. - Who stays? Why? Tazio!!! Tazio!!! I am going with you! Tazio! Stop! Halt at once! Run, run! Tazio!!! Tazio, slower! Tazio! Today I saw a headless knight - Where? - Over there, against the curtain. He was leaning down and turning his back upon me So, both of us saw him. Myself yesterday. Just at the different angle. From the front. He was leaning towards me. - A mass hallucination. - No, it was Jedrek. There is something going on that I can not grasp, I can not aggregate what I see into a thought, an idea Maybe Jedrek's one minute of life after 5 grams of coke had more meaning than the whole my life There isn't anything beautiful, anything great Except the death Tazio. What are you thinking about? Mr Erik Tvardstrup, the skiing instructor Mr Bazakbal, the writer. I'm so anxious as if something bad should happen There is a different life somewhere. Fuller, more interesting than what we do here. Please, reveal me where is it? Die schoenste welt. Here, across the mountains. India for example. It's there where I'd like to commit some terrible deed. Some evil. To commit a crime. Or to go to brothel. Or I don't know what I want. I'll take there meine kleine maedchen after the dinner. I am getting furious by the lies of the contemporary democracy Equal start for everyone. What moronic idea is this? Justice based on inequality, hierarchy is the foundation of sound social life. And I don't give a dime for workers' masses. - No one cares of anything anymore here. - And you're a Prince, it's easy for you Let the whole world crumble, I am a Prince am I not? Yes, Tazio. Tazio do you intend to insult any of us? You seem to be a person changing the beliefs out of fear that you'll be slaughtered. And you'd like to watch the revolution from the balcony, would you? What's coming - it is a grey end with unpredictable consequences. A wave is engulfing us which will destroy all our values What values? Don't make me laugh! Do you pretend to believe that we still have anything left? Without that we can't discuss the humanity at all And what about Buddhism? A religion without ethics. Isn't it the right direction? Hela! - You're a catholic! - For now There is everything in it. And what happens it will depend on who is going to free me up from the prison I live in Why haven't you waken me up? Sit down. Tazio shoot down a beautiful buck. Have a portion of it. I wish you could see it when it was in once piece It's delicious It had such a big, brown eyes. In the beginning they were wet as if it cried. And then they were becoming more dry It also had warm and delicate nose which got cold at the end. Sit down! What are we talking about? You should take life as is. Don't over complicate it. Simply observe it from the sidelines and live I am only the unsuccessful artist but I fear the minimalism of everything you could die for Interesting. But facing Kuba's gun you were frightened. Don't listen to that Tazio. I love you just as you're. This means you're spoiled brat. You like rotten food. In healthy body there is also healthy spirit - The body equals the worms. - I'm a sportsman, dear pal. You'd rather say a degenerate. When one looks at your repulsive faces then one can feel utterly hopelessness. - In the past people were healthy and strong by their nature. -Das is comisch. - How about Greece? - What Greece? I hate Greece. - It is a misfortune for the whole mankind. - You had different opinion before. Before was before and now it is this! Sport is killing everything. Your records are blocking the place in the newspapers for the serious art critics In the literary journals and others What are you talking about? You're not even the artist. - Sport will reborn it all - No, nothing! It will bemuse only. Bemuse. - Tazio! - How should I understand it my dear pal? I like skiing but I can't stand the sportsman. I'll wait at the dawn. Sit down! Sit! - Don't draw near or I can't withhold myself. - Sit down! Sport is the first sign of degeneration. Degeneration! - I don't want it! I don't. - Calm down. I'll get mad. Please or I'll get mad. You'll choke me. Stop it. I forbid you. I feel something evil will happen. My love! You make a fool of yourself. Calm down! - You egoist! You... - Quiet! You want to sacrifice your wife and child for some trifles? "A wife and child" You'll see a wife and child... You'll see. When you die, I'll kill myself and him as well You'll kill yourself? I won't be concerned too much then. How could you? You're so disgusting. Then throw up and get out of here. Get out! - But it is for your own good. - I stick my good in my ass. And you're not after me but only about... I'd prefer it'd not be here, do you get me? I'll commit suicide. I'll get mad. I spoke with God But he hid himself far in the Universe. That even the longest observation won't reveal him My lovely I go to my room. Bring me a tea. Tazio! Hela was here You... Not for her? True? Not for her? Yes? What a boredom. My aunt used to say: do something useful and she was right. You'd be the artist a homosexual, a machinist or a sportsman If Beethoven had listened to your music he'd have puked If everything is allowed if there are no limits Then nothing exists. Do you understand? Nothing! Nothing! A boredom is the fundamental ingredient of everything including the suicide Then go and puke and wash it. You know I never do believe in anything - Are you going to the dance? - Yes, I'm I'm looking for someone who could carry me away. One knight is biting the dust under the tree over there if he knew that by his death he gave me a notion of reality for only 5 minutes Thanks to him, I performed for the first time a purely personal deed A second one would be carrying you away. It is too much as for one evening. - I'll be alone tonight. - Yes? - Me? -Don't get sentimental over yourself. - Listen. We have to leave this place. - I'd like to. If you say once more anything so stupid I'll leave. I'm waiting. Hurry up, he won't be here till midnight. Hela! - Tazio! - Yes? - I can't get asleep -I've heard some voices like Ziezio still playing. - Come closer to me Yes? You have to try to go to sleep. Promise me that you sit with me till I sleep Yes, I promise - Kiss me - What? Kiss me Why? Kiss me Go to sleep What are you doing? I... Where from... you? Wait! Zosia! I don't understand Zosia! Watch out! So, what happened? Give me the gun. Zosia you don't think that me Give it to me Give me the revolver! So, shoot me. Go, shoot. Can I with you.... ? Life I understand this unbearable situation due to your sensibility But the course of law proceeding and some circumstances incriminating you Mr Bazakbal has slept with me that night, meaning in my bed In spite of that, we'll risk the experiment Please Please, leave us alone Could you take off your glasses? Do you recognize me? Baron also to meet with commissar? - Don't use those titles! - This corridor is awful - The conditions are appalling - It's temporary I don't have water at the hotel I got the mange on my legs Yes, yes it'll pass You need to work. Work. Work I heard about the pensions, dole for unemployed, medicines for free, school Yes, yes That's exactly how it is Do you hear? Everyone is occupied with their work with goals of higher end. the goals, the goals. This one! No! The other one Everything will be alright. He hasn't done anything. You dirty - Comrade Bazakbal? -Yes - Great! Your passport, two photos, certificate of birth, previous employment record and medical check Loyalty declaration, atheists' committee stamp, a signature - Miss -Thank you! - Miss... -Quickly please! - But? Miss, this is very important for me - Don't be intrusive But maybe I could invite you for a coffee? Coffee? Excuse me, but you mix me up with someone? - No, it is you! - Please, let me go - I won't - But... -Please I have very little time but I will meet with you. Please A priest, here? I agree... I don't where to start? I'd like to accept the reality as it is. I have nothing Nothing that I could believe in. My world was finished The future is yours and I accept it I understand that only value remaining is society Perfectly organized being, material. I agree - I'm all ears for you. - I accept it, I accept it. A dentist's cabinet is upstairs - Such a scream? - Yes, perhaps working without anesthesia I'd like to work. I wrote something you may be interested in. "Responsibility versus historical inevitability" So, you accept that we use you and then throw away? So, you agree to be the fertilizer? I am speaking with you that way as you're intelligent Think about it I have no choice and I think I could be useful If I was closer to let's say, the leadership - Oh, you can use the typewriter - Yes Do you want to work with us? You, the intellectual? -Yes! So, you'll be reporting on who's doing what - You'll be in the town, listening and observing - But - But? - Am I supposed to be a snitch? - You're to be useful If you want to work with us, you have to forget the previous morality - I am a free man - Puppy! Go, bark at this man He's using very bad words - Such a proposal you can... - Shut up! I thought we had an understanding? We give you the freedom Our Party is not like a christian sect commiserating any nit like you Kingdom in Heaven, salvation Rubbish We are building the new life, here and now! - You have changed - Times have changed I always thought there was a shining point at the crossing of all lines and when I loose it then I loose everything When I do that, all things will disappear and crumble into dust And I just lost that point I'll never find it back Too late Let's leave this place I'm 26 and I feel like old woman I beg you, take me away from here But I have nothing anymore I have no place to go Stop! Do you password? - Yes. I know - Say it - No, I don't know - A joker. Come here! - He's a spy - Shut up - You Russian? -Yes - Russian? -No I am Polish - A rascal! - No, I am a good man Like yourselves. I don't believe in God either I don't understand anything. Simply, I am a writer Hands up! Hands! So, you didn't like the revolution No, no, I liked it a lot but here is cold, so I am moving to warmer lands - Let me go - And do you know Pushkin? - Pushkin? Certainly, a lot - What a comrade! I remember you appeared in front of me like a magic like, like a vision like genes of pure beauty Is this all? Excuse me, I don't know anymore - Little - Let me go I have nothing Only shit, I am not a man anymore. Do you understand? You don't need to shoot don't need Squad! September 18th, 1939 when Poland was invaded by German and Soviet armies Witkiewicz committed suicide For sure, he had been aware that his prophecy was fulfilling The witnesses testified that his face was calm and relieved
