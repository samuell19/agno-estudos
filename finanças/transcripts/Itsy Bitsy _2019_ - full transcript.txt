Don't panic. They're not behind us. We did the right thing. They're savages. This is it. Be careful. Please help me. Please help me. No! No! This is the only way, my friend. I'm sorry. Easy, Mom. Hey, you gotta get some sleep. I wanna make sure you stay awake. This is doing the trick. You could talk to me. I'd like that. I don't really have anything. Come on, Jess. This move came on really quickly, and I... I guess I didn't give you a chance to express anything about it. That's on me. Decision's been made. There's nothing I can really say now. The city was really expensive. And the salary this guy's paying me is gonna feel like triple in the community we're going to. He could be a creep. He's not a creep, Jesse. He's a man with a debilitating disease. Still could be a creep. Stop that. These private home-nursing jobs are tough to come by. And we're lucky I got it. And with us living on his property, I couldn't ask for a better commute. We'll have meals together. Real family time, instead of me working such crazy hours, feeling like I haven't seen you and your sister for days. It's a good thing, even if you can't see that now. Trying to get shot? I've made quite the trip to see you. You still haven't learned any manners, I see. Since you are up... let me show you what has brought me all this way. Don't you recognize it? Only the tribal high priests have opened this during the harvest. It is said... to look inside is to stare into the dark mirror of your ancient's home. The Black Egg of Maa-Kalaratri. I know what it is. I just don't believe it. It is my gift... for you... for your wife. You've always thought that they... cursed her. She... was so very kind to me. And those savages poisoned her... because of this! It wasn't poison. It was malaria. No. I swore I would avenge her, and I have kept my promise! When you seek revenge, you dig two graves, one for yourself. I didn't dig graves. I left them above the Earth for God to see. So, you've committed murder. How do you think she would have felt about that? My customs are not yours. A gift of this magnitude requires a trade. Something of meaning. A true sacrifice. Don't you talk to me about sacrifice. She was my family, too. Go, leave, now. Leave. I've helped you find many treasures. None more personal than this. You should obey the old ways. To touch the Black Egg without an offering is very foolish. I've made my blood offering. Where's yours? I don't have your faith in folklore. Then wisdom has eluded you. Enjoy your gift. Hmm. Well, we're here. Where is here? Door's a little sticky. Well, this is it. Our new home sweet home. It smells funny in here. Well, once we get it cleaned up and settled in, it'll... it'll be great. Oh. Whoa. What are those on the wall? I don't know. Looks like no one's been here for a while. This is really dusty. I know, right? Look at these cracks on the ceiling. - Have to go. - What? Can you guys just start to bring in whatever you can manage? Oh, come on. We were supposed to be here hours ago. I need to check in at the house. - But all the stuff... - You know what? Do the best you can, babe. Start with the food and the bedding, and the rest is just gonna have to wait. Come on. Come on, help me out here. I've been driving for days. I can do it! Thatta girl! Unbelievable. Door's open. Mr. Clark? Kara? Hi, there. - It's Kara. - Kara! Oh, come here. Let me take a look at you here. Hi. Hi. What is this, a beauty pageant? Well, I was up late. Just playing catch-up here. OK, well, would you hand me? I'll show you the lay of the land here. OK. If I was a horse, they would have shot me years ago. Let's go to the grocery store so we can buy some waffles. That's a good idea. Do you think a ghost lives here? I don't think so. This is, uh, carbon-dated to the time of Cleopatra. And these ceremonial masks are from all over the world. Some of them are as old as 500 BC. You're not big on family photos, huh? You see, most of the human race is all from the same tribe. I don't see a microwave, so you may just have to eat one of these cold. Kitty cat! It's a stray. Get out of here! Be nice, Jesse. It's probably diseased. I hate it when you're mean. It's just hungry. OK. Don't let it back in the house. You're so fluffy. I'm gonna call you Mr. Whiskers. I like to listen to music, either jazz or classical. Helps me think. Too quiet in this house. It probably won't stay that way with the kids. Ooh, ooh, that reminds me. At night, I want this on. You feel like you're having trouble, you just call out, OK? I'll have the other one at my place. Ah, you give me a baby monitor? Think of it as an intercom. Oh, who's this? Tired. Need a nap. Mm, OK, you go ahead. I have plenty to do. If there is a god of this tribe... I curse it. Help me. Let her go! Come on, move! Oh, no. Uh, I'll clean this up. No, no, don't touch it. - I'll call the police. - No! Just give me a... a minute. I gotta think. That guy just broke in. Look, there are a lot of things here that aren't technically legal. I don't want the police coming in here, making an inventory. Who was that guy, huh? - Is he coming back? - No, he won't be back. I'm terribly sorry. You and your children are fine. It's a personal matter. It's over. - I'll get a broom. - No, don't. I'll take care of it. Ah! Ah... Do you think Stevie will find us here? What? We didn't tell him that we were leaving New York. He knows. Good. Don't bring it up to Mom. Why not? Doesn't like talking about it. Why? Misses him, I guess. Do you miss him? Yeah. Hey, son. - What are you doing here? - I... You're not supposed to be in here. Yes, sir. Well, who invited you here? I thought my mom might need this. Well, I... She's at the pharmacy. I'll make sure she gets it. You know, curiosity killed the cat. It can be deadly to people, too. Go on, go on. I did, I did. Sign this, Jane. Sheriff Dunne, please. Sheriff? That's a little formal between us. I've known you since junior high school Well, at work. Gotta stay professional. All right, sheriff, anything you say. Oh, you want your meds. There you go. All right. I was gonna keep 'em. - I'll see ya. - See ya. May I help you? I'm here for Walter Clark's scripts. Walter Clark, huh? You know him? Yeah, I know him. Here, kitty, kitty. I got some nice-tasting tuna right there for you. I know you want it. Here, kitty cat! Kitty? No, no. No. No, no. No. No, no. No... No! No. No! Baby... What is it? What's wrong? Spider! Just a spider? It's big and ugly like one of those thanatulas. Tarantulas. And while they're ugly, I don't think they're poisonous. It went behind that box. - This one? - Mm-hm. Ha-ha! I got him! - What's wrong now? - I didn't want you to kill him! Can I sleep in your room tonight? What's that? Found it. You stole it. Did not. Found it at Walter's. So, you gonna give it back? With all the stuff he has, he's not gonna miss it. That's called stealing. It's not nice. It's still on his property. Oh, come on, don't be that way. - Mommy? - Oh! Are you sleeping in your brother's room, sweetie? The spider came by the window. Can I sleep with you? You're safe. Go to bed. It was big, like the kitty cat. You were just having a bad dream. Here, let me tuck you in. You let your brother be. Will you check under my bed? You are fine. It was just a dream. I love you. Sweet dreams. Good night. I'm gonna go next door. You gonna be all right on your own? Yeah, sure, whatever. All right. If you need anything, just come get me. OK, bye. Wow, rebel without a cause. Huh? I'm here to speak with you, sir. Well, come in, come in. Your, uh, mother isn't here right now. She went into town. What do you want to talk about? I'm sorry. Oh. Mmm. Maybe I should call the sheriff. Do you even know what you took? - Yeah. - What is it? It's a cool carving... thing. It's a part of a set of African worshipers. Take one, and the rest are worthless. And I suppose that, uh, since you brought it back, I don't have to call the authorities. Are you going to fire my mom? Is that why you took it? You want me to fire your mom? You can't go around taking things that don't belong to you. Isn't that what you do? I mean... doesn't everything come from somewhere else? Well, uh, each situation, it's how you approach it. Whether you approach it respectfully, honorably. If not, there can be consequences for not just you but your whole family. Your whole life sometimes. Trust me. What if I don't get caught? Well, you will get caught. You're not good enough. I suppose you can't respect something that you don't understand. Hmm? I wanna show you something. Come on. Unless, uh... you want me to call the sheriff. Hmm? Here you go. Oh, honey, it's only spilled coffee. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I lost it for a second. I don't mean to be rude, and I appreciate you coming over here to check on me. But I was... I was hoping to get a little alone time. I'm sorry, I don't mean to barge in on you, but, um... something you want to tell me? Nope. Look, am I under arrest or something? Only if you order the chicken-fried steak. The meat is highly suspicious. No, I, um... I have this thing where, um... when something's not right, I feel it. So, help me out, OK? I don't know what you want me to say. It's nothing. You know, I've, um... lived in this town my whole life. And I know how to avoid stepping on toes, trust me. What's going on? Uh, it's just... It's just stress. Of a move. Trying to do what's best for my kids. I thought coming here would be a good idea. What's the father say? We, uh... we tried to make it work. We really did. Uh, and we thought having Cambria would bring us back together. It didn't. I see. Nothing ever really worked out the way I pictured, so... Well, I think people would say you're darn lucky to have those kids. Yeah, lucky is my middle name, all right. You know, when, um, I hit a rough spot, and I was hitting up the bar one too many nights a week. You know what I mean? Self-medicating. Well, when I finished with all that, I realized that what I thought were my troubles were actually my blessings. I just was too clouded to see it. I'm seeing clearly. - Are you? - Yeah. Your eyes are dilated, and your hands are shaking. You're not fooling anyone. You, um... you enjoy your alone time. I'll see you around. Hey, Joe, how you doing? Taking care. You take care. Looks like a bunch of junk. You know, well, one man's trash is another man's treasure. It's all how you look at it. There's no way we're gonna fix it. Well, if you look at it all at once, it might seem that way, but what you do is you find one piece that fits with another, gently put it together. And then find another and another, and you go from there. Now, your job is to clean each piece of any debris or tiny particles. Can you do that? Who's that? Mm, that's my wife, Maggie. We used to travel the world together, but, uh, we always knew we'd end up back here. Did she die? Yeah, she died. Sorry. She used to sit in that chair that you're sitting in right now. But she never really liked to sit very long. Hmm. What do these markings mean? You know what a legend is? Yeah, it's a story. Well, stories, you tell in a bar. A legend has a spiritual quality to it. Uh, it's ingrained in a culture by being passed down from generation to generation. This particular legend is Maa-Kalaratri. The Dark Mother. She's ancient... before time was time, before humans existed. She is the spider goddess. A creator of worlds, a weaver of destiny. She presides over the time that we humans are given on this earth. And she lives in the darkness between the stars. There was a time when the people began to lose respect for the mother. And so Maa-Kalaratri emerged from a crack in the Earth, decimated the village destroyed the crops and stole a child from the village's chief. The people began to offer up blood sacrifices to appease her. Sacrifices? I'll spare you the details. The people believed that, if they obeyed the sacrifice, their crops would flourish, the village would thrive, and they would be cradled in the arms of the mother. So... out of destruction and death, bubbles forth life. Do you believe all that? Well... I've seen a lot of things in this world that can't be explained by science. People need to believe in something, others, to blame. You believe in something long enough and hard enough... ...it becomes reality. Kitty cat! But no... I don't believe Maa-Kalaratri exists or has ever existed. Wow! Hmm. Jewels. They're all squishy. Kitty cat? Are you here? Hmm. Hello, what's your name? My name is Mr... ...covered in this stuff. What is this? I hope he's not bothering you. No, he's helping me. Um, where's your sister? Watching cartoons. Well, go check on her please. Right now! Cambria? I'm not playing hide-and-seek. Mom! Mom! That light's bright. I know, just stay still, OK? My head hurts. Well, you bumped your head. What were you doing? I was looking for kitty cat in the sticky snow with the dolls. Mm, well, you rest. I'll be close. I need you to make sure she doesn't fall asleep. She's OK? Luckily, it looks like only a mild concussion, but if she starts vomiting, you come get me. I will. I mean it. Stay with her. Try to be a little more responsible. This wasn't my fault. You left her alone. You have one job, look out for your sister. It's easy for you to say. Excuse me? It's easy for you to call it one job. But I make her breakfast, lunch and dinner, dress her, get her to bed and make sure she brushes her teeth. So that one job that you've given me, it comes with a whole lot of other things that you should be doing but don't want to! I have done everything I can for you and your sister. Always have. We moved here so that you two could have better lives. So, don't you dare question my dedication to you and your sister. We were fine in New York. We moved here because you got fired! Watch your tone. Or what, you'll ground me? Who will watch Cambria then? Not you! Enough! Not another word. Just be responsible and watch your sister. I know how to be responsible. I do it every day. Please watch your sister. I have the EpiPen, so let me know if you start to feel - any flushing or irritation - It's OK. It's fine, it's fine. Just go take care of your kids. Just check on that little girl of yours. I just need to organize your bathroom. No, no, no. Leave that till the morning. I'll be out of your way in just a minute. Looks like you're all set for the morning. Oh, shit. What is that? Um, I was... I was... I was bringing these in for you. I haven't taken those in a month. Well, they're for pain, so... Your pain or mine? What's that supposed to mean? Come on, it's not what you think. I can see where your kids get it from. Don't talk about my kids. You don't think I know what I'm doing? I'm a nurse. I administer medicine all day. - Just go. - I drove across country to come and take care of you, and that's what I'm doing. Look, you drove across country, running from your problems. - It's your weak thinking. - You can't judge me. Do you know what it's like being stuck with two kids? Doing it on your own? Doing everything you can for them, and it never... - It is all on me! - Oh, poor you. You think people succeed by not being responsible? I think that you sit up here, boarded up away from life, one step away from needing someone to wipe your ass for you. - Get out! - Wait. - Get the hell out... - I'm sorry. Your kids deserve a better mother. Kara? You always saw the best in people, didn't you? Walls for the wind, roof for the rain. Drinks beside the fire. Laughter to cheer you, loved ones to be near you. And all that your heart may desire. Oh, Jesus. Look! Vanilla pancakes? That's right, your favorite. Trying to bribe us? It's breakfast, not a scam. I want ketchup with my eggs. OK, ketchup and eggs coming right up. Why aren't you at Walter's? Walter and I aren't really meshing, so, um, I don't think it's gonna work out. Doesn't make sense. It's only been a few days. Well, better to cut ties now than months of trying to get it right. I don't believe this. What did you do? What did I do? Well, you did something, just like every other time. You know what? I'm getting really sick of your mouth. Are we going back to New York? I think we should see what opportunities they have in town for a qualified nurse. You're not doing this. I'm not letting this happen again. - Is Jesse coming with us? - Yes, of course he is. And my Misters? Yep, all of us. I'll be sure to let Stevie know. Walter? Ma'am? Uh, ma'am... uh, I know that this is very difficult for you right now, but, um, I'm gonna need you to come down to the station and, uh, identify the body. Are you kidding me? Uh, no, ma'am, please... please calm... calm yourself. What could have done that to a person? - I don't know, I'm sorry. - OK, OK. Let's just take it easy, OK? Donny, why don't you check upstairs, OK? Oh, OK, yeah, I'll go check it out. Good idea. I'm sorry about that. Um... What killed him? My kids need to be safe. What could have done that to him? I honestly don't know, but I'm gonna find out. And to do that, I need you to start being honest with me. There was a break-in. What? The first day I was here, some guy, he just... He snuck in, and he broke something. And he just ran out. What did he look like? Um, he was, uh, six-three, dark-skinned, and he had these scars on his face, like markings. Is that all of it? Sheriff, this is my fault because I didn't say anything. Well, we'll see if that's the case of not, won't we? We're gonna be here a little longer, so, um, why don't you go home and be with your kids? Let's go inside. Jesse... Have a look around, see if there's any, um, evidence of a break-in, and, um, let's dust for prints on all the outside doors and windows. Oh, hey. Hey, you can't be here. I know what killed Walter. Give me a minute. Go ahead. It was a spider. What makes you say that? Told me a story about a tribe that worshiped a spider goddess. Said they believed it was real. Helped him put the black egg back together, then he died. It's an evil spirit, and Walter was the sacrifice. You don't believe me. When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Do you know who said that? Sherlock Holmes. He's the reason I became a law officer. Solving crimes, putting away the bad guys. How you doing? You know, Holmes had his Dr. Watson. And I don't have a Dr. Watson. And I need all the help I can to figure this one out. I can do that. Great. So if you have any evidence, any hard evidence, any... anything that backs that story up, you bring it straight to me. I will. I got your back. I'm keeping an eye on you and your sister and your mom. OK? I'm gonna find the truth about what happened. Thank you. Oh... It's OK. It will be OK. All right. So, I was thinking it might be nice to hold a little ceremony for Walter this weekend. Like a party? Sort of. When people go away, it's custom to hold a celebration of the time you had with them. Maybe you want to wear your pretty white dress? And my fairy wings? Sure, babe. I think Walter would like that. And you have that nice shirt we got you... Maa-Kalaratri killed him. Who's Maa-Kala-party? Your brother doesn't know what he's talking about. Just like the one the tribe believed in. Stop it, Jesse. I'm telling you, it was a spider. A spider?! You're scaring your sister. Stop this! I saw a spider. Walter was just telling stories. He didn't mean that any of it was real. It comes and sucks blood. Enough! It feeds on sacrifices. It could get us. It's real! Stop it, Jesse! Cambria! Why would you do that? 'Cause you won't listen to me. Or does one of us have to die, just like Stevie. Cambria? Check on the kids. Cambria? Jesse? Cambria? No! Baby... Kids? Jesse. Shhh. Get behind me. Mom! - Mommy! - Mom! Mom. Oh... Get out! Go! Go! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! - Mommy! - Oh, no. Mom! - Mom! Mom! - Mom! Mom! Mommy! I'm really scared. Jesse... downstairs. - Phone. - I'll be right back. Come here. I want Mr. Giraffe. Call the coroner and get him out here. - Will do. - And get in touch with the CDC. They might need to send someone out here. Kara? Sheriff, come quick. My mom's turning into a spi... Jesse? Jesse! Get all available units out to the Gillette place. Send an ambulance out that way. Get... medical bag. Here. Take this. Don't worry, Mommy. Mr. Giraffe will protect us. Bring her to me. Jesse. Jesse, give me your shirt. Sweetie, hey. Hey, I'm here, OK? Mommy's here. I need you to be brave. Ow. Looks like it went clean through. It tried to eat me. I know. Mommy's gonna make it go away. Mommy's gonna make it better. It's OK. I need you to get your sister out of here. She needs you to do this for her. I need you... to do this for her. You go with your brother, and you do what he says. It's OK. The doctor's gonna come here, too. And he's gonna take care of Mommy. Right? She'll be fine. We have to go. Yeah. I love you, Mommy. It's stuck. The door's stuck. Come on. Jesse! Jesse! I think there's something in the chimney. Stay here. No! Ste... Stevie. I'm sorry. Kara. Kara, stay with me, stay with me. It's all right. Mommy. Mommy! All right, Kara. Kara, it's OK. You're safe now. You're OK. Just stay with me here. Mommy! - That's it. - Mommy! It's OK. Jesse. I love you. I love you. I love you. You think Stevie will know we're leaving? He'll know. Because no matter what happens, no matter where we live, we'll always be a family. Ahhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What's up, man? You OK? Yeah. Are you afraid of a few little spiders?
