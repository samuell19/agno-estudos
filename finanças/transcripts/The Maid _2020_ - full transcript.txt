It was very scary. Just when I think about it... it gives me chills. Started from nothing. It got stronger... and stronger. And it was always staring at me. What is this "it" you are referring to? It's a doll belonging to Lady Nid. A monkey doll. Yes! That noise it made... is still ringing in my head. Every time I think about it, it frightens me. You need to relax and stay calm. What you saw might be a manifestation of your own fears. It was everywhere. It could be anywhere. It followed me, and it was always watching me. Madame. I won't be able to work here anymore. I'm being haunted. And I saw a monkey. It's everywhere. And it's following me. I would like to quit. If you'd like to quit... I won't stop you. Then... I will take my leave. Chai. Yes, Madame. Please tell Wan to find me a new maid. Yes, Madame. Mommy? The story that Ms. Phon told... Is it true? Ghosts aren't real. This monkey will keep you company. But... But what? The maid told me-- Stop talking nonsense, Nid. I said ghosts aren't real. I will find you a new maid. Now sleep. Close your eyes. And then... there was another woman. A woman? Had you met her before? No. I'd never known... or seen her before. She was so scary. I can't describe her. When I told other people, they thought it was nonsense... that I was seeing things. They thought I was delusional. What is FTD syndrome? Frontotemporal dementia is a hereditary brain disorder. There's a rare chance of this syndrome occurring in small children. Is there anyone else in your family with dementia? Definitely not in my family. Later on, she might have forgetfulness, confusion, and hallucinations. Sometimes she might see an imaginary friend or something that scares her. Both of you need to understand her condition. Some people escape suffering... by stopping time in their own world. No matter how the outside world changes... they... still live in the time... that they think... is happy. But in the end, even though the world has stopped, the pain... still follows us. Are you Joy? Yes. Sorry! I guess I don't need to say much about how to behave in this house. Before you came here, I believe you've carefully read the duties of a housemaid... required by this house. Apart from that, just memorize the rules of this house, and do your duties to the best of your abilities. Most importantly, you must not pry into others' business. I believe you know what I mean. Yes. Don't worry, Ms. Wan. I know how to behave. I'm relieved... that you're a quick learner. Apart from the house chores, you need to take care of Lady Nid. She is sick, so she can't go out, and she has never been out. Introduce yourself to Lady Nid. Hello, Lady Nid. My name is Joy. What are you drawing? Pay no attention to that. Lady Nid suffers from some mental illness. She always thinks she sees things. You will be staying at the cabin down the road. I will have Chai take you there. And don't be late tomorrow. Madame doesn't like tardiness. Yes. And don't forget the rule: stay out of other people's business. Okay. Here is your accommodation. -I stay here alone? -Yes. There might be something broken here and there. If you find anything out of order here, report it to me. I will fix it. Can you stay here by yourself? Oh? Yes, I can. Chai. Why... does this house have high maid turnover? That's your maid uniform. Don't forget to be ready early tomorrow. I'll be going. I got the job. What job? Maid for a foreigner's house? You're going to be a maid there? -Why? -Why the hell would you want to be a maid? Unless... This is Joy, Madame. Hello. Where else have you worked? I used to work at a foreigner's house. Sounds like a good job. Why did you leave? My employer returned to his country. That house was sold. Luckily, someone told me that this house needs a maid. So I still have a job. How many people are there in your family? Four people. Me, Mom, Dad, and my cousin. Do you know what to do around this house? Yes, Madame. I promise that I'll do my best. I won't let you down. We'll see. No more dropping, Lady Nid. I can't pick them up fast enough. Let's have a nap. It's nap time now. Come on. Let's have a nap. Come on. Let's go nap. Come on. Here. Can I skip nap time, Ms...? My name is Joy. You need to take a nap. Close your eyes. Pick a place on those branches Feel the breeze and rest Sleep right here In this nest Feel the breeze and rest Sleep right here in this nest I'm so sorry! Are you alright? Are you new here? Yes. Name? My name is Joy. Joy. Bhorn, you're hosting a concert again? C'mon, Ms. Wan. I just want to create a cheerful workplace. Joy, do you know this dance? Poke and yank and poke and yank No, I can't dance. You're so outdated. Joy! Joy. How's Lady Nid? Sorry, what? One day, I'll throw your mobile phone away. Ms. Wan, wait. I'm still paying for it. Don't throw it out. It's not fun if it's not loud. Why does it have to be so loud? Take it, Joy. It's from the Madame. Didn't she give it to you? Ms. Wan's diabetic. She's on daily injections, so she can't eat it. She wants us to share it. Bhorn already had a lot. Look at me. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Has you mum ever taken you out? No. And your dad? No. You've never gone out? If you got a chance, where would you like to go? Anywhere, as long as I get to go out. Lady Nid. Do it softly. Just then, did you see it too? Can you read this book to me, please? I sure can. "Once upon a time, there was a farming family. They had two daughters... and the sisters loved each other so much. Although they weren't rich, they were happy with their lives. One day... the two were forced to be separated. They were so sad." You're going to be a maid there? Why the hell would you want to be a maid? Unless... Lady Nid. Lady Nid! Ms. Joy. I really did see it. There's another woman living in this house. It's true. -I saw-- -Nid. Stop talking. What is that? The woman I saw... looks like the woman in this picture. Where did you get this picture? I found it on the floor when I was cleaning the library. Wan, Bhorn, take Nid back to her room. Yes, Madame. This woman is not important. So you want to know... who she was? Just another maid who used to work here. Go rest. -I said go! -Yes. You look beautiful today, Madame. You're the only one who compliments me. If Master was here, he would compliment you, too. You know that... he hasn't come home in days. Because he doesn't have eyes for me. That's not true. You are so gorgeous. There is no way Master can't see. You have everything, Madame. No, I don't. Love... I've never seen it in this house. It's right here, Madame. Everyone in this house loves you. I love you, too. Master must be busy with work. Don't be resentful, Madame. Yes, sir! I am on my way. Yes, sir. My dad handled it for you. I really want to know... is there any problem you can solve yourself? Where are you going? I'm going to solve a problem myself. Ms. Wan? This person called Ploy... how did she die? Have you forgotten? If you want to work here, do not pry into others' business! -Bhorn. -Yes? When you're done, bring it to the table. Yes. Bhorn. What? Can you tell me? Tell you what? About Ploy. There's nothing. She used to work here. Then suddenly she left. It must have been five or six years ago. Nobody has seen her since. Oh, hey. Besides, nobody has ever seen anything like what you saw last night. But Lady Nid saw it too. You can't believe Lady Nid. She's just a child. Maybe she was just talking to her fairy godmother. Don't tell me you spent so much time with her that she stopped seeing fairy godmother. I'm leaving. Can you please tell me about Ploy? It has been a long time. Just tell me what you can remember. As far as I remember... at that time, Ploy was just a maid that the Madame hired to help out around the house. Ploy took great care of the Madame. She knew the Madame well. When there was nobody in the house, Madame always had Ploy beside her. Ploy... took away her loneliness, and made her forget her sorrows. Even Wan and Bhorn, who served her longer, couldn't compete. For the Madame, Ploy wasn't just a maid, but also a companion. But in the end... What happened in the end? Ploy left the house... without telling anyone. Where did you get these drawings? Where did you get the idea? Where did you get it? -You're hurting me. -Who told you to draw them? Who told you to draw them? Never draw these again. I'm getting rid of these. Never draw these again. Never draw these again! Who told you to draw them? Tell me! What are these drawings, Lady Nid? Who told you to draw them? Red is the Madame. Black is the Master. And who's the blue? The maid. I'm sorry, Ploy. From that day... until today, all I can do... is apologize. No one wanted it to be like this. Please forgive me, Ploy. Why did you come in here? I saw... Just now I saw... -I... -What did you see? I saw... Where did you get this? Lady Nid. You can leave now. Okay. You're good. Did Madame teach you? No, sir. Would you like some tea? Did Madame order you here? It is my job. I take care of everything she assigns me to. So my orders are of no importance? I'm your maid. I loyally serve every master in this house. You only try to please her. If that were true, why did I bring you tea? I see that you work late almost every night. Take a sip. You'll feel more relaxed. Enjoy, everyone. I envy you for having a beautiful and flawless wife like Uma. It's me who's lucky to have married Nirach. I envy you. Nirach, you should take Uma to social events more often. You know how important this is for my career future. I won't talk. Please, Uma. Just talk to your dad. Master, would you take a sip of your tea? Do you mind if I borrow some of your books? No, go ahead. The maid you told me about the other day... Who is she? Ploy. Ploy... Have you met Ploy? Have you two met many times? Where is she now? Ploy, get me some tea. Master, I have something to tell you. What is it, Ploy? I'm pregnant. Is this true? Yes. What's the important thing you wanted to tell me? Uma, I have something to tell you. Ploy is pregnant. I think it's a good thing. So our house... will have a child. What do you think? You're good. You came here with nothing... What else do you want? Uma! Once upon a time, there was a farming family. They had two daughters... and the sisters loved each other so much. Although they weren't rich, they were happy with their lives. One day... the two were forced to be separated. They were so sad. Are you Ploy? Yes. You are so gorgeous. There is no way Master can't see. You have everything, Madame. Love. I've never seen it in this house. It is my job. I take care of everything she assigns me to. I'm your maid. I loyally serve every master in this house. It's right here, Madame. Everyone in this house loves you. I love you, too. Master must be busy with work. Don't be resentful, Madame. This person called Ploy, how did she die? She used to work here. Then suddenly she left. It must have been five or six years ago. Nobody has seen her since. Little yellow canary Where will you sleep tonight? You can sleep Anywhere Pick a place on those branches Feel the breeze And rest Sleep right here In this nest Little yellow canary Where will you sleep tonight? You can sleep Anywhere Pick a place on those branches Feel the breeze and rest Sleep right here In this nest Sister, what happened to you? Go away! Joy asked to go to the market with Bhorn. And the things we need for tonight? You know that the Master takes this party seriously, right? Yes, I do. I've ordered some food from the hotel. For hot dishes and drinks, Bhorn will make them herself. Joy, do you remember how long you've been coming to see me? About two years. How are you doing? Anything unusual that you'd like to tell me? Nothing, I'm fine. As far as I can see, your condition is stable. I think it's a good thing. And... how's your job? It's good. I just got a new job not too long ago. Why did you quit the last job? Can you tell me? Let me go! Don't hurt me! Let me go! My employer returned to his country. That house was sold. Do you still have insomnia? No. I have normal sleep. Do you still have repetitive behaviors? No. I don't have anxiety either. Sweets help me a lot. If things continue this way, I think it will be good. It has now been two years. I'll adjust your medications. Please take them regularly. Yes, I will. Doctor, am I well enough to care for children? Children? Are you having children? No. I've found my older sister. She wants me to help care for her child. I'm glad that you've found your sister. I don't think there should be any problem. Bring your sister to meet me next time. I will. What took you so long? You good-for-nothing. Joy, when you're done with your stuff, come help me prepare for tonight. We must hurry. Yes. Where did you go? She waited so long that she complained. What did you buy? I went to a temple and a hospital. That's why I've bought so much. I need to use them soon. -They have fireworks? -There's fireworks. Wow. I wasn't expecting a party this big. -So big. -Yes. I saw foreigners. Can you speak English? No, I can't. Neither can I. -Chai. -What? The story you told me about Ploy, is that all you know? Yes. Are you okay? Are you looking for this? Yes. Take a deep breath. I thought you said you didn't know anything about Ploy. Hi. How are you? The food is ready. Would you like to add anything, Madame? In a while, serve the wine that the Master prepared. Tell Chai to prepare the car. Some of the guests need a lift tonight. Yes, Madame. Where's Joy? Helping Bhorn in the kitchen. She'll be out in a while. You look gorgeous today. How did you know I like red? You wear red. I think... it looks powerful on you. It's your birthday after all. Thank you, Nirach, for arranging my birthday party. How much have I paid? Oh, you're awake? How are you? Well? You know... actually... you shouldn't have lied to me. You're the one who helped Chai wrap Ploy's body. Be quiet, Bhorn. Wow. Sounds like a lot of fun in there. Be right back. Chai. Why are you sleeping? Chai. Oh! Chai. Chai. Joy. Are you alright? Are you okay? Relax... Would you like more wine? Here you are. Do you want more? Here you are. Did you get some? Just a second. Here. Am I too slow? Sorry I'm slow. The party is so much fun. So many damn guests. And today Madame is wearing her red dress. She's so pretty. I really like it. The foreigners at the party are dressed up in fancy white clothes. I want to dress like that too. Too bad you didn't get to see it. But it's fine. Hey, listen to me. We can have fun together. What do you say? Okay? Okay. Come on. Turn this way. Okay. What's your favorite song? Poke and yank That song, right? Let's see. Where is it? Found it! Dance with me. Dance. Don't want to dance? No? Okay. Just kidding! Just kidding! Dance, quick! Dance, quick! Don't you like this song? Sing it! Dance like this? Poke and yank and poke and yank Hello, Madame. Hello, Madame. Hello, Madame. Everyone. I want to thank everyone for being here today... on this special night, for my special one... the most important person in my life. To my beautiful wife... Uma. The boss is okay with it. He wants to talk to you. Okay. Me, too. Where are you going? Brief phone call. Take care of the party. What are you doing? Yes? Nothing... Where is Wan? She's with Chai. Take care of the guests for me. I'm going upstairs. Yes. Is it going to work? How many votes will he get? How is your business? We are preparing to buy land. If there's an offer one can't say no to, everyone will support him. I have no problem. Madame, you're staring at me... as if you want to tell me something. Yes. You're Ploy's sister, right? These are the letters that Ploy... No. They're the letters you wrote Ploy when you were young. Ploy kept them well. And this is Ploy's family photo. You have a copy of it too, right? Honestly... if you wanted to know about your sister, you didn't have to make up... a ridiculous story. I'm sorry, Madame. Everyone told you already... that Ploy... left the house without telling anyone. I didn't know where to find her. I didn't know where she went. Madame, do you know... how horrible it feels to slowly suffocate to death? I had no idea how painful it could be... until Ploy told me about her experience. You were merciless... to leave Ploy to die like that. I've had your favorite tea prepared since early this evening. It's a pity... that it's not hot anymore. I love you too, Madame. Thank you, sir, for taking care of everything. It ended so well because of you. Sir, please let me explain. Well... I've already tried to talk. Sir... I don't want a promotion. I don't want money. I don't want a mansion. And I don't want your daughter anymore. I'm going to have a drink now. Ploy. Ploy. Ploy. Ploy! Ploy. Ploy. Ploy. Nid. Nid. Wake up. Ms. Joy? Aunt Joy. Let's get out of here. Wait for me outside.
