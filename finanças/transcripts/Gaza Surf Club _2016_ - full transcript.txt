This entire road is full of holes. Why did you bring this? Man, there's no sun. What will we do? We'll see. Get the other one. Take it Mahmoud. Get changed! Yeah ok That's too much wax.　-Am I supposed to slip then? Yeah, slip and break your neck. Leave me some. You put enough, leave me some. Enough, Ibrahim! Here...　-Great! Let's go! Get ready, come on boys! I'm the oldest among them and the most experienced. Because they're still young and excited for this sport this eagerness overcomes their logic. Like a rocket! I wanted to go to Tarek, but the waves were going to kill us both. They're all committing suicide. During this war...　-The soldiers! What should we do? Did you add sugar?　-Two spoons. Stop. Right here, stop. Ibrahim! Go, go! One day, I was sitting with my parents and my mom told me about a girl She is about two years younger than me. She was still studying and came for a visit from Qatar I saw the girl, I liked her. So what did I do? I sent her an invite on Facebook. But the girl wasn't convinced. Someone meets a girl once and proposes to her overnight? She crossed my mind again one month later, so I talked to her. Hi, this is Ibrahim.　-"Hi back." How are you? Fine. I said "I want to ask you something" she said "go ahead" I said "Why did you refuse the engagement?" She replied one week later saying... I'm sorry, I refused because I don't want to live in Gaza. Eventually I understood. A country that is always facing war... We have adapted to this. But people like them... They probably don't have power cuts for more than a minute every five years. They don't hear the sound of missiles and rockets. Back in the days, when I was a child... I thought about surfing after watching a documentary about surfers in Europe. Teens and children were surfing and had everything provided like real surfboards that were designed for the waves and not dangerous like ours. They had the means. The program showed how they train and the different clubs they have... so I dreamt of becoming like them but the situation here is harsh. ...pull, pull! Hey.　-Where have you been? You were sick all this time? I am 42 years old my dreams are almost destroyed, but I'm still hoping to go abroad and to see the athletes, the people. I've been working in this area for 42 years, since I was born. It's true, we're by the sea but it feels like a prison. For you it's easy to come here from Egypt, Spain or Europe... but we can't leave the country. If this was for a couple of days, even a year or two... no problem. But from the moment you're born until you die there is no hope. We have no hope. And if you think there is hope, then please point it out so we can search for it. Where is hope? Tell us, where is hope? I've been surfing for seven years, my father taught us. My friends are proud of me when they see me surfing. They like it and ask me to teach them. so I teach them and they become surfers like me. Not exactly like me of course... you can say... not quite as good. When I'm in the sea I feel happy and free. When I'm older and become a doctor our community won't allow us to surf because we will be adults and it's considered shameful. Sometimes, I ask my older sister to come and watch me swim and surf. She watches me from the shore and I can see that she's sad. I tell her "you wish to go back in time ..when you could surf and swim". She's 16 years old. She doesn't surf or swim. That's nice. The girls surfed when they were little but now the situation changed. When they'd go in the water, people would rush to stare at them. Once I took Shoruq and Sabah to the harbor. We took the board and started surfing, while the people were filming us. Then the coast guard came and told me to take my daughters and leave. So I told him "You can keep your harbor". When the girls were still surfing, those were the best days. We used to swim wherever we wanted without anyone interfering. Today it's different. Today everyone is controlling us, in the sea and in everything else. They say that girls can't swim because it's considered a sin, a disgrace. This is Nadine. Of course I'm going to teach her to swim and surf, no question. I'll put some floaters on her and throw her in the sea... like a sea turtle! The worst thing is going back to work after the beach. Work is so exhausting. We want this sport to develop in Gaza. We want to be able to improve these kind of things. So we thought of building another floor on top of this place. Here, in this corner... this will be the maintenance section, which will be a large room. It will be closed off from the wind in case we need to paint. Paint boards and stuff. And over here, we are going to build a room... for a computer, a laptop, other electronics like a TV. And this section will be an open space An open room with chairs, a place to meet. If I can acquire the visa we will save a lot of time because this training that I'll be getting is in Hawaii. And they could teach me how they make these boards how to fix them and ways of selling them. It is forbidden to get these boards into the Gaza Strip. Second, we don't have a club in Gaza that supports this sport. We don't have a club an organization or a federation. They tried to form a federation or join the Sailing and Water Sports Federation but all attempts ended up failing. Ibrahim suggested... to travel from the Gaza Strip... to Hawaii to participate in a surfing workshop and a training in the repairs of boards that we use for surfing. Back in the days, about 25 years ago... the kids used to surf on wooden boards. So, as kids we used to bring a piece of wood from a closet or a table for example, any piece of wood. And Ahmad's brother was an experienced carpenter so Ahmed and I thought of making a wooden surf board. We made this one but it didn't work out for us. We found that it was dangerous and it eventually broke. It's heavy and dangerous It's impossible to build a board in Gaza because surfboards require a special kind of foam and fiber and these are not available in the Gaza Strip We received 24 boards via Israel from California. From Matthew?　-Yes, from Matthew but they were confiscated for two years inside Israel then they made arrangements with the Red Cross and brought them in. This board... This board is very dear to my heart because it's the first one I bought second hand from Israel. I trained on it for nine years with Mohammed Abu Jayab. We had only one board, so when Ahmed was surfing and I'd see a wave coming I'd have to wait my turn and vice versa. so it was a mix of joy and suffering because we didn't have enough surfboards. Look! All this sea and we only caught half a tin of sardines. There is nothing left in the sea. This is the border, see? This is the border where the oil tankers are The fishing zone used to be 30 nautical miles, or 20 so we used to catch lots of big fish. Then when it was three miles and they expanded it to six we caught lots of fish for a week, then the fish disappeared again. If they would expand it to 20 miles, the catch would be great! Abu Khalil, wait. Khalil, did you take some?　-Yes Hi, Ibrahim Hi, Matthew, how are you? Good, how are you?　-I'm fine Trying to get my camera working Hello　-How are you? All these boards?! Yeah, those are my boards in the background, yeah Yours? Yeah Okay, nice　-For Hawaii... you need different boards, for big waves and for small waves My big one, I surfed it in very big waves and I broke it but here, we can fix them easily You can travel to the US and you can study some English and you can do your internship you know, you can do your studying in the shops and then you go back to Gaza and build the clubhouse. When Matthew came last year we became close friends. I told him that I have a place and... and I'm thinking of bringing... surf gear, wet suits... water sports gear... He asked me why, I told him we could open a store. But I don't know where to buy these things from abroad and I don't know their prices. He said he'd support me in this project on one condition to call this place Gaza Surf Club and it would be a guide for anyone who comes to visit the youth of Gaza and at the same time, it would be a meeting place for the youth of Gaza. When can I receive... the visa? I don't know, we have to see the business in doing the schedule is not from the embassy they find another company to do it the government is like this, it has too many systems even for me, this is very difficult. I don't understand the system you know, sign in, create... how many accounts did we create for this? we have now, like four accounts with different companies, trying to make the visa it's so stupid. Hopefully, you'll get the information for an appointment this week. Inshallah (God willing)　-Keep checking your email. Okay, don't worry, every 20...　-...all the time. Every 20 minutes　-Yeah, okay. Just sit in front of the computer like this, waiting, waiting... I don't come here all week I work for three days in the hospital and in the summer, I work as a life guard. I work for a day... two, three days, a week... it depends. But when there are good waves, that's it: I HAVE to go surfing. because I can always go to work later whereas good waves only come once a week or even once a month. Sometimes there are good waves all week, and sometimes there's nothing for a month so we seize any opportunity we get. Matthew sent me an invitation to travel to the embassy in Egypt. They refused to give me a visa because here, it's hard for a person to get a visa from the first try. Especially because I'm young. So they rejected my visa 5 times and I wasn't allowed to enter Egypt. I am not even thinking of living abroad anymore. I lost hope. When I traveled to Egypt I paid $ 2.000 to cross the border just to get to Egypt and do the interview. After my visa was rejected and I returned to Gaza I didn't think about it much anymore and I didn't try again. But then Matthew... and the people in Gaza told me to try via the embassy in Jerusalem... there's nothing to lose. I tried. And if it works then great, and if it doesn't... then that's ok too. I like to drive a clean car not a dirty car, you know? I love cleanliness. I love it a lot! When a car looks clean then so does the driver. What?　-Looking good! Dear Abu Mahmud!　-God bless you! Thank you, God bless you! All my friends and colleagues love me and I love them all back. If girls could compete in swimming tournaments my girls would beat everyone for sure! They swim so well, it's scary! I'm proud to say that I'm the one who taught them... Dad, open this please. This is an islamic nail polish, so when I put it on... and go to school... if the teacher scolds me, I remove it. It's easy to remove and your nails will go back to as they were before. Once, I swam wearing the scarf and it choked me underwater. It was tied on my neck, so I removed it and tied it around my waist and swam without it. My cousins asked me why I'd swim without a head scarf I told them it's my business whether I wear it or not, don't interfere. I don't like it when people interfere in other people's business. It's my personal decision. They'd say that's forbidden, that's haram (a sin). I know some little girls who used to swim and participate in competitions but had to stop when they got older. Her father allowed her to do all that, but her husband wouldn't allow it. When she got married... her husband disaproved of her participating. Our tradition doesn't allow this. It's not acceptable... And we're fine with that. The Qur'an says to teach your children, but doesn't mention women. Maybe by children, they mean boys and girls. Hey Yousef, where are you? What are you doing at home? Goddamn... I'm not going to the sea, I'm going back home! I'm at the store and I've been waiting since 10 AM. I ask about Ali, he's at home and you're at home! Didn't we say 10:30? I don't want to surf anymore, I'm going home. Bye! Am I supposed to wait for each one of you? You said you'd be here at 10 AM, right? Ibrahim called and said we'd go, right? I was with him just now Okay, why doesn't he want to go? ...we repaired my leash. Why doesn't he want to go? His father won't let him... He wants to come with us, but doesn't want to surf. Whatever... Call Ibrahim and ask him...　-Here Ibrahim, where are you? So, you can't go in the water? What? He said his father shouted at both of you? No... He called Ibrahim and asked "where are you" Ibrahim said "I'm at the store" His dad says: "don't you move, I'll be there in a minute!" Ibrahim's the one who motivated us and now he's not joining, damn! The sea is angry today! What's up, where are you going? -We're going to surf. You're going to surf? Oh God. Ali, what are you doing? Why did you go to the fish store? I thought... I told you my father won't let me go if he sees you. He didn't allow him... -Do you know how my father found out? When he saw you all coming in the van. My uncle heard that I wanted to surf and he started screaming on the phone. Mahmoud came while we were arguing and just stood there watching... He said "I swear if I see anyone surfing, I'll raise hell" Look at the sea, the waves are so high! People were leaving the beach...　-It's dangerous! People were leaving and when they saw us... they came back to watch us surf. Even the harbor is whipped up by the waves. What about this one?　-Just tie it like that. Mahmoud, this one also needs to be tied. No man, it's just so they don't fly off, we'll drive carefully. Ali almost broke the fin... I was standing there suddenly a surfboard fell on me imagine a surfboard flying towards you! Bring some more　-No, no Ibrahim, there's no coffee... We don't have clubs or anything. This right here is my club. I'm proud of it and it's dear to me. A metal shack, 1 x 2.5 meters This is where I keep the surfboards. I'm proud of it. We teach the youth and we have fun at times and sometimes we get bored. Just like our lives. Some waves require fast hand strokes. Based on what?　-You look to the waves around you If you see a fast wave, you speed up. Children come to us to learn surfing They are all friends, neighbors or our own kids and we teach them what we can with our limited resources. More? Yes, more. My father was a fisherman for 50 years he advised me before he died to stay away from the sea because it brings poverty He said "find another job" I tried to stay away from the sea, but as I said before... there is no hope. So I came back to the sea. I go from home to the sea and back home, over and over again. I spent my life by the sea, for 42 years. And if I live long enough, I'll stay this way until I die. From home to the sea and back home again. And my son will be the same. Everyone has a goal or a dream in life. I dream of traveling abroad, and of being famous here in Gaza. Like those actors in Egypt. When they go out and people ask for their autographs. I dream of being like this and girls asking me for my autograph. To be honest, I wish I could travel. Do you need a hand? Push a little more. Hi, Ibrahim.　-Matthew... I want to talk to you about something. Yeah, sure. I got the visa today. You got the...　-Visa To go to the US?　-Yes. Got approved? Yeah, I went to the embassy. Wow! That's great.　-Yes, yes. I thought it will never happen! Wow! Good job! Yes, thank you. Are you free or...? Yeah, you should come as soon as you can because there might be another war.　-Yeah. Try to get out. If you have the visa now, come now. Yes, I have to wait for one week until they send me my passport. Okay, great, you'll have a long flight to get here, but just remember that at the end of the flight, you will be in Hawaii. Soon to Hawaii.　-Very good. Give me a call in a couple of days... Yes, I will call you. Great, I'm so excited, Ibrahim. Thank you, me too. Come on, move! Ibrahim! Ibrahim! Get up, son.　-What time is it? It's past seven! Mom! Good to see you Great! You made it! How are you?　-I'm good. How are you? Let's give a hat to these guys. These two guys, the lifeguards? Let's give them a hat. Matthew, what's this? Coconut. That's haram (a sin)　-Why? Because it's not yours. Give me. Give me! That's right, exactly. How do you say in Arabic?　-"Joz Hend" Joz Hend　-Yeah, "Joz Hend". It's a very complicated word. Anyway, so in Hawaii, everybody has coconut trees but nobody keeps the coconuts because they worry about it falling on their heads so they have a company like this, they come and they cut them. So it's very difficult to find some. Khalil! Yeah?　-Hawaii. Hawaii, Abu Khalil.　-What? What, Abed?　-Hawaii. What?　-What does that mean? Hello in Hawaiian.　-Oh... Aloha! I pray to God the tea will boil... in a year. You can finish work and leave and the tea still won't be done. God willing...　-Were you cold yesterday? Last night I covered myself with 25 blankets I didn't feel warm until I added the 26th. 26 blankets! I only got warm when I started to suffocate. Ahmad is pretending like he wasn't freezing. I swear I wasn't cold, if I was, I would have told you. How many? Is this for me?　-Yeah for you, it's okay? Taste test. It's okay? Acceptable?　-Yes, thank you. Thank you, sir. One for me. Get your face wet. Wet first... no, with water first. Get it wet. Cold or warm or what...?　-Warm, yeah. Warm, then put this and then leave it for like five minutes to make it soft. There you go. I'll open this. I have cream, no problem? What kind... oh sun cream. Yeah, sun cream.　-No problem. Every time I go to Gaza, when I go to get my hair cut they ask me if they want me to shave with the razor, the straight razor. It's called straight razor, the one you use in Gaza, this one. Yes.　-Straight razor. Straight means like straight line.　-Yes. Straight, straight razor. And always they ask me, "do you want to shave?" and I'm afraid. But in Gaza... we have a lot of people who are very good. They can do it with their eyes closed, they're professionals. Yes.　-Yeah, but I'm still... I shave with one like this, a blade. The color's OK for you sir? Green, yeah, Hamas, I love Hamas. Green from Gaza.　-I know what you're thinking. Very good, I wasn't thinking that, but that's very funny. I think that's enough.　-I think it's good. ...after the machine.　-Yeah. And then, they have here safety rooms as well they have one, two two more This is after the machine? What the machine does... so this is still the stringer so we have to cut down the wood by hand That's like 30 years old So when we see the contours... and you look, you can see the tones in the color, and this is soft so for us, we want the edges a little softer here and as you go down you see how it changes and the edge comes out so... Yes.　-Yeah, if we were scaping outside the light from the top was outside, we can't see this. Be careful. Matthew, take my picture.　-Yeah. But not...　-Not with the girls? Ready? Ibrahim, smile. No it's ok, they're behind you. 1, 2, 3, very good. Here, on this little point here is a very very good surfing spot but only one day a year maybe but it's unbelievable like a movie. And here, you can surf here, you see this at the end of the island? But you need a boat. When there's waves from the north... this is the north here. when there's waves from the north you can surf there. you take a boat out, you surf on this wave. This is Rabbit Island Rabbit is "arnab"　-Rabbit, yes. My friends are not... they know why I'm here so of course they are thinking about... that we will do something when I return for this sport. And I'm sad because some people are relying on this thing working out. But I don't know what will happen in the end. Let's say they allowed us to get surfboards into Gaza will the people there appreciate them? Will they afford them? As long as the situation in Gaza doesn't change it will be difficult no matter the price. During the war I feared more for the boards than for my children because they can't be replaced. You can have another child: you get married and you have another child. But there's no replacement for a surfboard, we can't get them across the borders. Why did you put them now? Only the big ones. Yes, put it there. Give me that, habibi. Put it here. The fire is hot enough to cook a camel. So, all I said was: I really thank you for coming and sharing your "Ike", you know what you see from inside. And to join me in honoring us as people and our Gods by drinking this water. You're a friend forever because you drank the water. This needs a little more time, more work, but... It will be similar to this one.　-Not ready, yeah? He will show you one that's ready. You feel the weight? The weight difference... to this? Hi, nice to meet you.　-Hi. What's your name?　-Ibrahim. Ibrahim? That's good. This is the stuff we use, it looks almost like explosives really. It's a two part epoxy like clay.　-Yeah. And then... and then underneath here When I go back to Gaza, we'll try to get surfboards in. If this doesn't work, we'll try to work on the smaller boards. These boards consist of a foam mold which is available back home. But the result won't be the same because here they have machines but we're going to try. Yeah?　-Yeah, perfect. Yeah, nice job. Have fun, this is for you.　-Yes, thanks. Thank you.　-Be safe. You gotta do this and then... Okay. How are you? Hi, can I order a few pizzas to pick up, please? Sure, what kind of pizza?　-Thank you. Does your... the "loaded pizza" has sausage on it, right? Sausage, pepperoni and the veggies Okay, can I get it just veggie? Just a veggie pizza? Yeah.　-Yeah, I'd like... I'd like two veggie pizzas, one cheese pizza and one pepperoni. Okay. Come here. Do you like onions? No.　-Me neither. If you like them, I'll put them in front of you. Get out of here are you trying to teach me? You're annoying, get out of here. You're so talented! Can you wash the dishes like this? I'm not very good in English. My Arabic is really bad too. Sorry!　-Don't worry. But welcome to Hawaii. Not sure how much you do know about Waikiki, but Waikiki has a lot of history with surfing If little Waikiki beach can help you know that's... we're honored to help. Share... share the Aloha, share the knowledge... share what we can... the ocean and through Matt You worked hard to get here, so good job, you know. This is just the beginning. Ibrahim, now this is your first time to Hawaii? Yes.　-And where are you from? Gaza, Palestine. Now over this summer, there was a lot of violence in Gaza, did you have to stop surfing?　-Where? This last summer with the war in Gaza? Yeah, but I went surfing. You went to surf anyway? There was five days of... Ceasefire... Ceasefire, yeah. But not while there were actually bombs falling. No, two days before... they killed children on the beach Yeah, the beach was targeted heavily in the last campaign...　-The Bakr family And are there any girls that are surfing in Gaza? Now?　-Yeah. No, that's difficult but there were some little girls they learned a little about surfing but now, they don't surf. Because they are women, not men. Because they're too old? -Yeah, the girls grew up so... They grew up, now they're married and not allowed to surf, okay. Move a bit to the side. Prepare for the 'land assault' ! Say: with the grace of Allah. Just remove it, it's ok. Do you want to remove it? Or wear it in the water? Wear it. How far do you swim? As much as you like. Three meters? Ok, then we will go together to "chalet" and swim. Okay, let's do that. In which club did you learn to swim? Here on the beach. Are you wearing a suit? That's the suit.　-What's it for? Sabah, come and explain it to them. I imagined Hawaii was going to be just nature just the sea and trees... But I discovered it's also... No matter what you imagine something to be like as long as you've never seen it, you will always be surprised. The many things they wear... The people's appearances. The tattoos and what the girls look like. Not all of them, of course, but... Covered in tattoos... They are like that, it's their nature but to each his point of view. In the past 10 days, I haven't seen... I haven't seen a single girl wearing all of her clothes. four or five days ago, I saw one girl and I took a picture of her There are girls wearing veils in Hawaii? People are so nice to each other over here. In Palestine, maybe because people are always under pressure maybe that's the reason but nevertheless... each country has its problems. Here, people are good to one another. Maybe that's why this island is so successful. They take good care of it. Once upon a time today I was feeling lost like everyone does Wave after wave chasing one another We are both walking in a valley in different directions One valley has a glowing sun, the other an idle water-wheel My surfboard is my son and my daughter. My blood and my soul. I don't know much besides the board. Because surfing... is what makes me forget everything. In the waves, I'm in a different place a different world. Waiting for a wave that will shake the world and lift the cloud of worries. Waiting for the wave, every day holding on to the dream But the most beautiful beach in the whole world Abu Mohammed... The shores of Gaza. The shores of Palestine. There's no sand in the whole world like that of Palestine. The truth was simple, clear and innocent to the one who can see it. They love the sea and they love to play. You can't live and be happy without playing This is life in Gaza. Waiting for a wave that will shake the world and lift the cloud of worries. Waiting every day for the wave holding on to the dream Waiting for a wave that will shake the world and lift the cloud of worries. Waiting every day for the wave holding on to the dream Gaza is nothing without the beach It's the only escape for the people despite the siege and the blockade, it's their only escape. Waiting every day for the wave holding on to the dream Once, Gaza was one of the best places in the world. And now it's one of the worst, but this situation won't last forever. It will change one day for sure and be better than before. They say "nobody can sit forever nor stand forever. The world keeps turning." (KJ:Gaza Surf Club)
