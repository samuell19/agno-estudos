Are you still there, Count Andrassy? Yes, Your Majesty. - Which way do we go now? - I think this way. No, I think that way. I think that we're lost. I'm afraid you're right. We have to turn around. No, I don't like to be the last one. Let's rest for a while. As you wish, Your Majesty. Here you are, Your Majesty. Thank you. They'll wonder where we have been. They'll be happy that we've lost our way. We're usually the first ones. Count Andrassy, I can't tell you how happy I am in Hungary. I'm glad, Your Majesty. Here I finally feel as free as I did in Possenhofen. In Austria, it would be impossible for me to ride unattended. There would be at least 20 secret police officers hiding behind the trees and bushes, making sure nothing bad happened. Here, Your Majesty is under my personal protection. Yes, but it's not only this feeling of freedom that makes the stay in Hungary so nice. Here I have my child all to myself. The little one already speaks a few words of Hungarian. I noticed. Let's go for a walk. Your horse jumped magnificently. Excellent! Very good! Did Count Batthyani excuse his absence of the hunt? - Yes, Your Royal Highness. - And how? With a polite excuse. Your Majesty knows the real reason. No, I don't know. The father of Count Batthyani was executed with 13 other generals after the suppression of the rebellion. That is why Countess Batthyani made her son take an oath never to speak to the emperor and to refuse to show him any kind of respect. Did he also take an oath to stay away from his queen? Certainly not. But he is hardheaded and disloyal. Moreover, he symbolizes a very strong power. He is the head of the strongest party of resistance in the country. That's why I want to speak with him. There must be a way to come to an understanding. Your Royal Highness already sees that he even disregards the invitation of his queen. Then invite him to your castle, Count Andrassy. I will meet him on neutral ground. Your Majesty would honor me by being a guest in my castle? I am looking forward to it, but please keep it informal. I had my fill of rigid festivities in Austria. I have heard that the Hungarians can celebrate better than any other nation. Yes, but when Hungarians celebrate, it mostly ends up in a so-called "Mulatschak." - How do you say it? - Mulatschak. But that is nothing for Your Majesty. I beg you, Sir, let me read your hand. Please, Sir. - Aren't you curious? - Very much so. But I fear it could be unpleasant news and, as a result, destroy all of my hope. Then she shall tell me the future. What do you read in my hand? You will have two more children, Madam. Girls? First a boy... ...and then a girl. And you will always be healthy and happy. Give her a gold coin for the good news. I don't have any money with me. And give the children something, too. Poor lady. I would not want to trade places with her. Do you believe in the prophecies of gypsies? I would not be Hungarian if I did not believe in them. Gypsies have a sixth sense. Sometimes they know more than we do. Yes, that's what I have heard, as well. That woman is crying for help! I wouldn't take it too seriously. - What's wrong? - Nothing. But we need to do something! But it doesn't mean anything. Why are you hitting that woman? I'm so sorry, Your Majesty! What have you done? Don't you see? It's the queen! Your Majesty, I am inconsolable. Your Majesty. Don't worry. I'm not going back. Exactly, let's let the gypsies have their domestic peace. Yes, if she loves her husband so much that she defends him after such a beating, he might as well keep beating her. But Your Majesty is still warm from the hunt. I am afraid Your Majesty might catch a cold. Hopefully not. I am lucky that the emperor doesn't see me in these clothes. You are so serious, Mama. Are you worried? Yes, Franz. I am very unhappy. Obviously I am doomed by fate to always play the role of the mean mother-in-law and tell the people I love only unpleasant things. What is it this time, Mama? You see? You also ask, "What is it this time?" And it's true. I have to tell you something unpleasant again. I do not think that it is right that the Empress of Austria is passing weeks alone in Hungary and does not bother with her husband or her country. But, Mama, Sissi is also Queen of Hungary. Do you also consider it appropriate that she surrounds herself with a circle of revolutionaries and even tries to start a friendship with Count Batthyani? A man who offended you publicly. I think it is mean to talk about obedience when Count Batthyani took an oath for his mother. You always find excuses for everything that Elisabeth does. I am left with no choice but to tell you what I would have preferred not to voice. I have come upon letters from people of absolute integrity, which all report that Count Andrassy is in love with Elisabeth. But, Mama! The two of them go riding together for hours without any company. He is allowed to appear at the castle without prior announcement, and he sends Elisabeth flowers every day, just as the gentlemen at the theatres usually do when they are having their affairs. Mother, I beg you to hold off comparisons of this kind. I love Sissi, and she has my complete trust. Of course, she is very beautiful and everyone is fascinated with her charm, especially the men. But she is still no Catherine of Russia. She is the purest being that I know and a person of character. I beg you, Mama, not to surround the Empress with spies in the future. So you are not planning on calling her back to Vienna? By no means, even though I long for her day and night. Their Majesties the Duchess Ludovika and Princess Helena in Bavaria. Aunt Ludovika? Ask them in. She was visiting the Queen of the Saxony with Nene and has written to me that they are going to visit us for a few days. That's a pleasure. Dear Aunt Ludovika. I am especially pleased to welcome you here to Vienna. The pleasure is all ours, Franz. Sophie! Nene. Welcome, my dear. How nice that you made a detour through Vienna. But of course! We haven't seen each other in a long time. Since your wedding. Where is Sissi? She is not in Vienna. Not in Vienna? Oh, that's a pity! Well, my dear, if you want to visit the Empress of Austria, you have to go to Hungary. There it is! Take the doll with you, but come quickly. Sweetheart! Mama! - How are you doing, my sweetheart? - Good. And you look so pretty! And Mama hasn't seen you for so long. Hello, Baroness. - What have you played with? - With the doll. - With which one? - This one. With the big one? Come, let's go play with her. The big one, yes? - Nene has become very pretty. - Yes. Why hasn't she found a husband yet? That's something that I, her mother, don't even know. She passes out only rejections. When one was once so close to becoming the Empress of Austria, it is not really difficult to understand. Did she not have any inhibitions about seeing Franz Joseph again? Yes, certainly. But I had to pass by Vienna. I have something very important to discuss with you. I hope nothing unpleasant. Well, it is not exactly pleasant. That's what I thought. So, what has happened? Well, it is terrible! Ludwig, our oldest, has set his mind on marrying the actress Henriette Mendel. Has he lost his mind? The Emperor of Austria is to become the brother-in-law of an actress? That is unimaginable! He has completely distanced himself from us and lives in his college apartment in Munich. Something must be done! That's why I am here to counsel with you, Sophie. Moreover, I have told Max that he needs to go over there and talk sense into him. Ludwig. I will not leave here until you have promised me that you will not marry Henriette Mendel. If that is all, then it is easy for me to do. Namely, I cannot marry her anymore. No? Because we are already married to each other. Ludwig, don't make any jokes. I am completely serious. We were married secretly two years ago. And you didn't tell us a word! - Nene knew about it. - Nene knew about it? One is absolutely betrayed and lost with one's own children! Papa. - Oh, pardon me. - No, no, stay here. May I present to you, my dear Father, my wife and my daughter? I am speechless. I can imagine, Your Majesty. You see? This is your grandfather, whom I've told you so much about. Look at him. Well, there he is with a child and a wife, for God's sake! - Well, what is her name? - Mariechen. Well, come here, all of you. - Mariechen, yes? - Papa. Cute little thing. But how are we going to explain this to your mother? That's on you, Papa! Of course, I have to do it. I don't care if you marry a Mendel, Mondel, or Mandel. Excuse me. Marry a "bourgeois." That's what I wanted to say. But you know the relatives. Especially Aunt Sophie. You should have at least thought about Sissi, since she is the Empress of Austria. But Sissi is just like you. Well... My dear Sissi! I hope that you are having a nice time in Hungary, but considering how long you've been gone, could you return to Vienna for a few weeks? The Viennese can be very jealous! And me, too! I bought this one in Vienna. Charming, Your Majesty. The Duke Max in Bavaria. That's impossible! Why? With me, everything is possible. Papa, what a surprise! In our family one should be used to surprises. - Gretchen, please inform Mama. - Gladly, Your Majesty. Now tell me, Papa, what are you doing in Vienna? That's my secret. - You keep secrets from me, as well. - Me? You did not tell me that Ludwig is married and has a child. Because I gave him my word not to say anything. Yes, and now I must figure out a way to tell Mother. If I only... Well, Max! Hello, Vicki. Has something happened? No. What should have happened? Because you are suddenly in Vienna. That doesn't mean that something has happened. I just missed you. But you didn't even know that we're here. I didn't know, but I thought that you were here. So I said, "You know what? Let's meet them halfway." To whom did you say that? To myself. I always like to talk to myself. Max, I know you're up to something. But, no. What should I be up to? What do you want? Aren't you happy that I'm here? Of course, we are very happy! Listen, Papi, today is a ball in my honor. That means I have to put on my tight uniform. Please do it for me. It will still fit. Now tell me, did you speak with Ludwig? - Of course, I have spoken to him. - And? Did you get through to him? No. That means, yes. Actually, that means, no. - Which one is it? - Well, actually, yes. He told me, "I promise I won't marry Miss Mendel because I cannot marry her anymore." - That's what he said? - Yes. Well, then everything is fine! Yes, I think so. That is marvelous! Where is Sissi? I haven't said hello to her yet. Then you must go to Hungary. - What? - Yes. - Sissi isn't in Vienna? - Unfortunately not. Well, does Mami get a coffee now? Please. There. Pour some for Mami. Thank you. A little milk. There's the milk. Good. Thank you. And now some sugar, as well. Yes, thank you very much. That's good coffee! Wonderful! The coffee is wonderful. It was very good coffee. May I remind Your Majesty... Thank you... Yes? ...that today is the party at Count Andrassy's castle? Yes, I'll be right there. Sweetheart, now give me a nice kiss. That was nothing! One more! One more time! A real big one! Thank you very much. - Tomorrow we'll play again, yes? - Yes. Say good-bye. Good-bye. I am really looking forward to this evening. I've asked Count Andrassy to organize a real Hungarian evening. But he says it's not the right thing for me. He has told me that Hungarian parties always end with a... How do you call it? With a... Mulatschak. Do you know what a Mulatschak is? No, Your Majesty. But maybe Major B?ckl does. - Why Major B?ckl? - He studies Hungarian day and night. He is in love with the daughter of the caretaker, the little Margit. He is always in love. - Tell him to come. - Yes, Your Majesty. Speak German. They don't all need to know what we are talking about. What exactly is happening here? - Why? - It's a surprise for you. - A surprise for me? - Yes, today is your birthenday. - What is today? - Your birthenday, isn't it? "Birthday." It's called "birthday." How do you call it? "Birthenday." "Birthenday..." That is sweet of you. Was this your idea? Well, yes. But you don't really deserve it. - Why don't I deserve it? - No, no, no. Say, do you still love me? Sure, Margit, I love you very much. Then you swear that you don't love other woman. No, unfortunately I cannot swear to that. - I see. - No, you don't. The woman I love, I mean, the other woman, is no threat to you. I only love her in my fantasies. - So I was right. - What do you mean, you were right? - I know who this other woman is. - You know which woman? - Illunka told me. - Illunka told you that? Yes, she heard it from the chambermaid. What does a chambermaid know? - You are in love with the queen! - Are you crazy? What if somebody hears you? Yes, but it's true. Of course! Well, nothing is true! I admire the queen. I adore her. - But you love me! - Good God! Please, stop. - Major. - Yes, Countess. Her Majesty wants to see you right away. - To Her Majesty? - Yes, but quickly. - Margit. - Go away, you double-faced man! Excuse me. Where did I put my helmet? My sword? - Well, where did you put them? - You came without your sword. Oh, I think I know! I left them outside! At your command, Your Majesty. Major B?ckl to the fore. Major, do you know what a "Mulatschak" is? - At your command, Majesty. - So what does it mean? Well, it is difficult to explain, Your Majesty. Mulatschak... Mulatschak is the name for a period of time, for a couple of hours, when every Hungarian thinks he is in heaven and all angels are gypsies. Have you ever participated in a Mulatschak? At your command, Your Majesty. I have attended several. And? Your Majesty, in these hours I was Hungarian myself, and in heaven. And the Count wants to deprive me of such a thing. Thank you, Major. You may leave now. Yes, Your Majesty. - What is wrong? - Nothing with me. He has my parrot. I mean, my glove, the parrot. Her Majesty's carriage has just arrived in the park. Good, thank you. Dear friends. I have promised you a big surprise for this evening. But I don't want to take you unaware. That's thoughtful of you. I have the great honor to inform you that I am expecting a very important guest. Who? Her Majesty the Queen will be here. Thanks for telling us. Just enough time left for us to leave your house. You can't do that. That would be an affront impossible to explain. Under no circumstances will I remain here. And I think Czaky and Paralfi will agree with me. We're leaving. But I'm begging you! Her Majesty, the Queen. I am very pleased to be invited to your beautiful castle, Count Andrassy. I am happy to welcome Your Majesty in my modest home. May I introduce a few of my guests to Your Majesty, who did not yet get the honor to be introduced to Your Majesty? Count Czaky. Count Paralfi. Count Batthyani. Count Batthyani, I am pleased to finally make your acquaintance. And now that we shook hands with each other, I hope that we can become friends. May I ask Your Majesty to the table? Yes, gladly. What should we do? Naturally, we have to stay now. Franz-Karl, I urgently have to talk to you. What is it? Has something happened? What happened? Nothing happened. If only we could still dance with them. That would be great. - A little break from dancing? - We are going to the park. The moonlight is so magnificent. - The moonlight. - Yes, yes. My hearing gets better every day. Yes, I've noticed. - I need to catch some fresh air. - Yes. Franz Joseph is in an especially good mood today. Nene too. I haven't seen her this happy in a long time. What is it? - Will we be undisturbed here? - Yes, yes, I think so. - I have a big favor to ask you. - Yes, go ahead. It's the reason why I came to Vienna. I was wondering if you could talk to Franz Josef and ask him to ennoble a young actress. Well, bravo! Your girlfriend. You are a rogue. But no. What are you thinking? It's regarding the young lady that my Ludwig secretly married. - He secretly! - Hush. - What is her name? - Mendel. Meindl, like the Julius? Mendel, Mendel! I see. Maybe he can at least make her a Baroness or something like that. Yes, I'll take care of it. - Yes? - Yes. What kind of name shall we give her? Anything that sounds nice. In return you may shoot a deer in my forest. I don't care much for shooting. I prefer to go fishing. I recently caught... - A fish. - A fish, yes. A Waller. This big, in Wallersee. Wallersee. That would be a nice name for Mendel. Yes, all right, let's name her Wallersee. This big was the... Was the... - Fish. - Fish. It's beautiful here, Franz. The ball is magnificent, too. And you are its queen. Everyone admires you. I do, too. Tell me, Nene, how come you're not married yet? Why do you, of all people, ask me that question? Because I wonder. You look enchanting, and I'm sure you had lots of opportunities to get married. Nene. What's wrong? Did I hurt your feelings? Not today. I apologize. It was clumsy of me to ask this question. But I didn't know it affected you so much back then. I thought it was a combination of our mothers who wanted to marry us without asking us. Well, it was. When I came with Mama to Ischl to be engaged to you, I did not know more about you than that you were handsome and that you were the Emperor of Austria. But then I saw you and got to know you better, and I felt that I could be happy with you. Nene. You have no idea how unhappy I was when I realized that you loved Sissi and not me. I thought that I would not be able to live anymore. The only thing I knew was that everything fell apart inside of me. I know that I'm not really supposed to tell you all this. I didn't want to tell you, either. Never. I will never love another man the way I have loved you. Farewell, Franz. Batthyani is completely enchanted by Her Majesty. Who isn't charmed by her? My dear Count Batthyani, I don't want to discuss politics with you. I don't know anything about it. I just want to try to bridge differences. No, Your Majesty. The differences dividing our countries cannot be bridged. In my opinion, insurmountable differences do not exist. I simply love my country. So do I. And the Emperor wants to and will do everything to give your beautiful country true peace. True peace! What is that? Order, peace, happiness, contentment. Exactly what you and your supporters strive for. Have a little bit of faith in your King and your Queen. Or do you think you're unable to do so? Since I have come to know Your Majesty, I almost believe that I could have faith. That's nice, Count Batthyani. And now I know that everything is going to be all right. Where there is a will, there is also a way. Excuse me, please. May I ask Your Majesty to open the Palledance with me and thereby crown my ball? Yes, my pleasure. Finally there's a genuine human being in this lmperial House. Your Majesty! Is Your Majesty feeling dizzy? No, no. It's only this... This stupid feeling. Is Your Majesty in pain? Yes, since the last hunt. Your Majesty did catch a cold. Maybe. It's already... It will pass. There she is! Let's get some fresh air, yes? Yes, Your Majesty. - Where is Her Majesty? - I don't know. She was just here. I am glad that you Majesty recovered so quickly. It's already much better. Maybe it was the Duhgeier that got to my head. Yes, that is possible. It is too fiery. A very old vintage. What will you think of your Queen now? The same thing I always think. That she is the most beautiful and charming woman I know. And that's... Why don't you continue? I am not allowed to, Your Majesty. You wanted to say, "And she is a little tipsy." Isn't that right? No, Your Majesty. Then I wish that you speak. What did you want to say? That I am undyingly in love... ...with My Queen. But, Count Andrassy! I have loved Your Majesty from the first moment I faced Your Majesty. I would never have said it... ...but Your Majesty ordered me to. Count Andrassy. You know how much I appreciate you and how grateful I am. You have brought Hungary to the Emperor. Through your strengths and your wisdom, you have turned the hatred of a nation that lasted for decades into love. You were my only friend. The only one I counted on. I would be unhappy if I lost you as a friend and adviser. Promise me that it won't be the case. I promise, Your Majesty. Promise me that you will forget everything you have just told me. Everything. I can't do that. I can't do that, Your Majesty. I am helpless. I don't know a way out. Then I will have to find one. Please, stand up, Count Andrassy... ...and take me back to the party. Major. - Major. - Yes? Gretchen will be happy that you came to my birthday party, too. May I ask for a dance? I don't have time. I just came to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow morning. - Where are we going? - To Vienna. For a long time? I don't know. I have to go back to prepare for departure. What a disaster! Why are you so sad? Because I have sad news. Come sit down. - We are leaving. - When? Tomorrow morning. When are you coming back? I have no idea. Don't cry. Otherwise, I'll cry, too. - You are going to forget me. - Never. As soon as you're gone, you will forget me. And he's playing such a sad melody on top of everything. Please stop. Tell me, Countess, do you like G?d?llo, as well? Yes, Your Majesty. I never would have thought that it would be so difficult to say good-bye. It is not good-bye forever, Your Majesty. No. But for a very long time. Mami. Make sure that the horses are exchanged as quickly as possible. Yes, Your Majesty. Will Your Majesty use the opportunity to have a little snack? - Yes, just a glass of milk. - At your command, Your Majesty. Come, my child. Come on. You will get something to drink, too. - Are you the innkeeper? - Yes. - Where is your guestroom? - Over there. - Is it empty? - No, one guest is in there. He has to leave immediately. Bring a glass of milk. A glass of milk, as you please. Your Majesty, one guest is still present, but I will make sure that he'll disappear right away. Sir, will you please leave the room as soon as possible? Aren't you listening? You have to leave. Your Majesty! Your Majesty! - Franz! - Sissi! How did you get here? I was on my way to G?d?llo to pick you up. Why? Did something happen? No. I wanted to see you. And I wanted to see you. Papi! My angel! She looks magnificent. Yes, she has recovered well. Major? Your Majesty? Please take the little one outside to get some sun. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, may I carry you in my arms? - What do you want here? - Well, the milk. Out of the way! Out of the way, please. Did you work a lot? Yes, the political situation is not very pleasant at the moment. You look very tired. Most likely because I didn't sleep last night. We had a grand ball for Nene. Nene is in Vienna? Yes. I left right after the ball. Is Mama there, too? Yes, and Papi, too. Papili, too. I'm looking forward to seeing them. I don't think you will be able to see them. They left this morning. Oh, that's a pity. But now tell me about you. You look exhausted, too. Yes, I didn't sleep last night either. I left right after Andrassy's ball. You were at Andrassy's? - At his house? - Yes. I wanted to meet Batthyani. We have spoken to each other, and I think that we have found a new friend. - How does Nene look? - Very pretty. Is she finally going to marry this... Thurn und Taxis? I don't know. They've been engaged for nearly two years. Please don't leave me alone anymore. Stay with me. Yes. Please don't go back to G?d?llo right away. No, I said good-bye to G?d?llo for quite a long time. But I also have a favor to ask of you. Make a little bit more time for me. I promise you I will. Now you do, yes, but when we are back in Vienna, everything will be forgotten. We are not going back to Vienna. Nor are we going to G?d?llo. We are going to Ischl. Just the two of us? We are going to hide out for a few weeks. - And they're ours, exclusively. - How nice. They smell great. Of course they smell great. - Whose child is that? - I don't know, Mama. That's odd. How does a strange child get in here? Mama has seen the child already. Little one! You, little girl! Who do you belong to? What are you doing here? Where is your Mami? Where is she? Well, where? Now go and get the two. Come, we're going to look for your Mama. We're going to look for her. Max, look. There is a strange child walking alone in the garden. - Do you know whose it is? - Well, it must belong to somebody. Yes, well... But I don't see anybody. Let's go. - Did Mama see the child already? - Of course. Papa and I have planned it very well. My heart is pounding. Don't be afraid. Everything will be all right. Who do you belong to? What's your name? Well, she can't speak yet. - But she is cute. - Yes, very. A dear little girl. What would you like? A glass of milk? Maybe rather a beer? Oh, come now, Max. You're crazy. A beer for such a little child. Look, this is something for you. There you go. She's hungry. Do you like it? Oh, she is such a sweetheart. Max, a child of this age is truly missing here. Yes, all our own are already too grown up. A mother has nothing left to do. You probably just want to keep it. Yes, I would. But I don't think that the parents would give her away. I don't think so, either. Ludwig! Papa gave us permission to visit you. My wife, Henriette, me, and Mariechen. Your wife? You're married? And this is your child? Our child. And you knew all about it? Calm down. Franz knows about it, too. That's why I was in Vienna. He has ennobled her. She is now Baroness Attersee. What am I saying, Attersee? Wallersee. There are no Waller in Attersee. I did it all by myself. Well, I am speechless. You mustn't be, because it's your turn to talk now. Well... If God has given two people something as dear as this child, then He wants to say through it that they belong together. Welcome, Henriette. Vickerl, I didn't expect anything less of you. Sissi. Do you already have more than I do? No. Then I have won! I surrender. Catch me! Sissi! Sissi, for Heaven's sake, what is wrong with you? I don't know. I had it... I had it several times in Hungary. But maybe I just ran down the hill too fast. I'll take you home, all right? No. It's already better. I will send for Dr. Seeburger in Vienna right away. Or better yet, we'll travel as fast as possible to Vienna. Come. Are the doctors still with Her Majesty? No, Your Majesty, but the council is not over yet. Then please tell Dr. Seeburger that I expect his report right after the council. As you wish, Your Majesty. The relations between Austria and Italy are momentarily not the best, Your Majesty. That is why everything that could make matters worse must be avoided, especially since Austria has been completely isolated since the last war. I believe this is also the opinion of Your Majesty. Yes, certainly, Excellency. Please ask again about the well-being of Her Majesty. Certainly, Your Majesty. I'm sorry, Excellency, that I couldn't follow your report as well as I would have liked to. I certainly agree with you that everything has to be done to avoid another war. Why doesn't anybody want to tell me what is wrong with me? Because the doctors are not sure yet, but I'm sure it's nothing serious, Your Majesty. Why, then, has Dr. Seeburger summoned a council of four professors? Your Majesty should not worry too much about that. I can feel it myself, something is wrong with me. Always this strange pain in the same spot? Her Majesty's condition is very bad. The heart? The lungs. For Heaven's sake! But it's only an acute affection, or...? Is it contagious? It is my duty to tell Your lmperial Highness the truth. The professors demand an immediate change of climate but even then there's very little hope for a full recovery. Her Majesty, of course, knows nothing about this. How shall I give the Emperor these dreadful news? He must know the truth. And the parents of the Empress must be informed, too. Yes. For the first time in my life I am helpless. Come, go to Mathilde. Get the ball, Mariechen. Get the ball! Get it! Get the ball! - Good evening, Your Majesty. - Good evening. - I have a letter from Vienna. - A letter from Vienna? That's great! Thank you. A letter from Aunt Sophie! - Yes? - Yes. Mariechen, throw it here! Throw it to me, Mariechen! - Mariechen! - Take the ball, Mariechen! Get it. Oh, God. - But that's impossible! - What is it, Mama? Max! Max! - What is it? - Max! What's wrong with Mama? I think she's got bad news. What a terrible misfortune! Sissi is very sick. Sissi? Oh, my God! Isn't that horrible, Max? Where is the little one? I have informed the chambermaid that Your Majesty wants to see the princess. - Pardon me, Doctor. - Yes? Pardon me. How is Majesty doing? - Unfortunately, not well. - Horrible. Hello, Doctor. I am on my way to the Emperor to tell him the truth. A difficult task, Your Majesty. God knows it is. I will allow Her Majesty to get out of bed today for at least an hour. I am afraid that a terrible depression could come on top of everything, which would make the condition of the poor patient worse. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Poor thing. Where are you going? Her Majesty wanted to see Her Royal Highness. Bring the princess back to her room and wait for further instructions. - Yes, Your Majesty. - I want to see Mami. Another time, my child. Mami is sleeping now. Mami. I am really allowed to get up, Doctor? Yes, Your Majesty. But only for an hour. I'd like to surprise the Emperor. He will be very happy to see that I am healthy again. I am sure, Your Majesty. Countess, can you please bring me my dressing gown? And tell Major B?ckl to let the guards tread off. Yes, Your Majesty. Major, Her Majesty wishes that the guards in the corridor tread off. Certainly. Guards, tread off. March! I still feel a little weak, but I think that's from lying down for so long. Are you bringing news from Sissi, Mama? Yes. We will speak later. Is she feeling better? My dear Franz, I have been fighting with myself for several days now because I have to tell you something very sad, and I don't know how to tell you best. What's going on, Mama? Come, sit down beside me. You may leave me alone now, Countess. Nothing is going to happen to me. Sissi is very, very sick. And the doctors are afraid... What are they afraid of? They are afraid... Well, you have to finally know the truth. The doctors are afraid that Sissi can't be saved. That's impossible. What is wrong with her, for Heaven's sake? Sissi has a lung disease. And the doctors think that she should immediately be moved to another climate, because it would be dangerous to leave her close to you and the child. I know it is difficult, Franz. Very difficult. But, as the Emperor, you owe it to your country and your child. You need to avoid any kind of intimacy with Sissi. Do you know what you are asking of me, Mama? I love Sissi more than my life. I know, Franz. But nevertheless, you have to consider that every one of her kisses is contagious, and that the child must be protected from her kisses, too. You also have to consider other things, Franz, even though it appears heartless to talk about it. The country demands a healthy Empress and healthy children. And most of all, a healthy heir. And... If what the doctors are afraid of should become true that Sissi won't survive this winter, we already have to consider right now who will come into question to become your wife. I bar you from talking so cruelly, Mama. Sissi is alive, and with God's help she will become healthy again. And if the Almighty wants to take the dearest thing I have in this world away from me, then I will never, never ever get married again! Even if the country does not get a heir. You have no right to think of yourself, but only of the dynasty and your house. Don't forget the sacrifices I made to keep the dynasty of Habsburg. I have renounced the throne for you. You have told me that 100 times already, and I wish you would not have renounced. I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. I sure would have been much happier. So this is how you thank me for everything I've done for you. I have never longed for becoming Emperor. I have only done my duty since I became Emperor. The only happiness in my life was Sissi. And if she is no more, everything will be meaningless. Now you have spoken like a good bourgeois, but not like an Emperor. Sissi. The doctor has given me permission to get up for an hour. I wanted to cheer you up and come and visit you. I didn't even hear you coming in. I stood in the doorway. Since? I mean, how long have you been standing there? Just long enough to hear everything that I probably had to hear. But don't worry, Franz. I will get healthy again. And if it's God's will, I will also give birth to a healthy heir. I will go where the doctors send me and do everything they ask me to do. And always remember that I don't want to make you unhappy, because you love me. Here, please. Flowers from His Majesty again? Yes, His Majesty instructed the gardener here to bring Your Majesty the most beautiful flowers every day. If I only knew what I could do to bring the Emperor joy. By getting healthy as soon as you can, Your Majesty. Yes. If only that was in my power. We've been here several weeks, and my condition has not become any better. It takes time, Your Majesty. Your Majesty must first adapt to the climate. I think I must rather adapt to the thought to never get healthy again. But, Your Majesty! Yes, I am aware of my condition. I know it very well. What's wrong, Mama? Oh, Nene. I can get no peace. I need to see Sissi. The poor thing is sitting in Madeira and probably thinks about her sickness all day. Yes, the worst thing in such a condition. Exactly. She needs somebody to build her up, to encourage her, to give her a new will to live. I know for sure that I could help her very much now. Hello, Doctor. Are you bringing good news? Is the Empress feeling better? I am sorry having to disappoint Your Majesty, but the health condition of Her Majesty is unchanged. It is despairing. I've heard that Dr. Seeburger has arrived. I wanted to find out what kind of news he brings. Bad news. Still no improvement? Unfortunately not, Your Majesty. And to make things worse, a heavy depression has set in, leading to the worst of concerns. Terrible. Your Majesty, here is another gift from His Majesty. It is so sweet how His Majesty spoils me. Every day, a new gift. Every day, flowers. Everything could be so wonderful. It will be wonderful again, Your Majesty. I do not believe in prophecies anymore, Countess. A gypsy once told me that I will always be healthy and happy. Was I ever really happy? One must not be ungrateful. One must not sin. I was happy very often in my life. And sometimes, shadows must come; otherwise, one would not appreciate the sun anymore. That's right! Mama? - Sissilein! - Mami! My child! My sweetheart, my darling. How are you doing? Mami, how did you get here? King Ludwig has given me his yacht so that I could visit you. How nice that you are here! I have missed you so much! I just didn't want to write you to come because of the long journey. But, my child, I would have come to you even if you would have been 10 times as far away, because I know that you need me now. How is Papili? And Nene? And the children? Oh, they all would have loved to come, too. Countess, could you please prepare a room for Her Majesty? Yes, Your Majesty. Can you please take my things with you? - Of course, Your Majesty. - Thank you very much. You have it very nice here. A beautiful piece of land, this Madeira. Yes, but I do not really know anything of Madeira yet. I spend the entire day lying here, and all I know is the view out on the ocean. Yes, that is what I have thought, and that's why I'm here. I will cheer you up a little now, all right? You need to distract yourself. You cannot always meditate. You need to move a little. Yes, you know, I am always so tired. Weariness passes, sweetheart. You'll see. The first day, we'll only walk a little. The second day, a little more. And then you won't think about your sickness at all anymore. That is very important. For example, look at the bourgeois women. They are often sick, too, and meanwhile have to work, and sometimes so much that they completely forget about their sickness. And all of a sudden, they are healthy again. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe I have really let myself go a little. I'm sure. So, from tomorrow on, we will start walking. First we'll look at the town, and then the entire island. See? Over there is France, Portugal, and Spain, far, far away. See? Over there. How far Vienna must be. You see, sweetheart? Now you can already climb a mountain. - Yes, with difficulty, but I can. - Then take a little break. There are bananas! I need to get myself one! Stop, stop! Slowly, slowly! We agreed to everything at its due pace. Yes, Doctor. Excuse me, please. I have a German-Hungarian dictionary. No, I mean, I have a German-Hungarian dictionary, and I would like a... What do you want? You speak German? That's wonderful! - Please, help me. - Gladly. The man says that he does not want to buy. But I don't want to sell! On the contrary! I have here a German-Hungarian dictionary, and I want to exchange it for a German-Portuguese dictionary. Oh, I see. He says that he doesn't have any dictionaries. Oh, what a pity. Excuse me, but do you know a language teacher who could teach me Portuguese? Yes, with me. With you? I'm a student. I teach German classes. - When could we start? - Whenever you want to. Right away. In that case, right away, please. Yes, but where? Shall I come to you, or do you want to come to me? We can alternate. For a start, I would suggest a lesson by the sea. - What does that mean in German? - I agree. I knew that. I understand it. May I, please? Well, Sissi, what are you dreaming about? You know, it's is so strange. Everything suddenly seems so beautiful to me. - Yes? - The garden, the flowers, the ocean. You see? Earlier, you didn't notice any of it. I could stand here for hours and look at the ocean. I would love to take a long, long trip across the ocean. You got that from your Papi. He dragged me all over the oceans. The stronger the waves, the more he enjoyed it. I was always very sick, but he was reveling in it. I don't think there is anything more beautiful and exciting than the ocean. I have read so much about Greece now. About Corfu and Athens. I would love to see it all one day. Let's go there. Yes, Mami. We will do that. My child, I am so happy. I barely recognize you. Do you know that you haven't spoken about your sickness for weeks now? Yes, and now you are already making traveling plans. - You're the best doctor for me. - Hopefully. Thank you. No... Cheers! - Yes, and now let's get to work. - Great! - No, no. Not like this. - No? How do you say, "I want a drink"? Good. And how do you say, "I am going for a walk by the sea today"? Great! And how do you say...? Now it's my turn to ask. How do you say, "I love you"? - This is not important. - Yes, this is very important. - Yes, it is. - No, no. How do you know that? Ah, that is the sentence that I learn first in each language. - Major. - Hold on. Oh, excuse me, please. Yes, please? Excuse me, Major, if I'm disturbing you. But I was told that I could find you here. Yes, please. What is it? You have to come immediately. We are leaving. - Again? But where? - To Greece. To Greece? Countess, please, you know that I adore our Empress, but she is driving me insane with her endless fondness of traveling. But, Major! As soon as I knew Hungarian, we went to Madeira. Now that I speak Portuguese, I have to learn Greek. I am convinced that you will find an equally beautiful teacher in Athens as you found here and in Hungary. - Do you think so? - I am sure of it. And now hurry and say good-bye. Don't be sad. - That's easy for you to say. - Good-bye. How do you say "a pity"? But I have to leave. I know. - Don't be sad. - No, no. Isn't this impressive? Indescribable! I have such respect for this country and its culture. Look at these columns! Wonderful! The purity of the architecture. And this wonderful view! Major, are you as excited as I am? I am amazed, Your Majesty. If one considers that all this was built 500 years before Christ's birth... What kind of artists, what kind of builders must they have been? Yes, you're right about that. Another letter from Sissi. - She writes almost every day now. - Bravo. What did she write? I can't believe it! Do you know where Sissi is? In Corfu. In Corfu? What is she doing in Corfu? "...haven't written before because..." Read a little louder, please. I want to hear, too. "I hadn't written to you about my plans to travel to Greece, because I was afraid that you would have not approved out of concern about my health. But the journey did me very well, and I am happy to be here. But you and the little one should be here as well, of course. I have found a charming house that I want to buy and decorate with antique Greek art." - She's already shopping again. - Bravo! Please write to her that she should decorate a room for me, too. But not Greek. Comfortable. Going by the letter, Sissi must feel much better. It is full of optimism and joy of life. - Have you been waiting long? - No, no. But we have to hurry, otherwise we'll miss the boat. Yes, I know. I just don't understand where Countess Bellegarde is. Countess Bellegarde, one moment please. I have no time. Her Majesty is expecting me. - I am in a big hurry. - But it is very important. Dr. Seeburger just arrived. He absolutely wants to examine Her Majesty today. But that's impossible! Her Majesty wants to go to Athens. I know. But if you could please inform Her Majesty? - Yes, yes. I will do that. - Thank you. Oh, Major. "Oh, Major, Major." It could happen to anyone. Well, who is that? Well, who are you, my pretty child? I haven't seen you yet. If I only knew what you're saying. What is your name? Alexandra? Andromache? Iphigenie? - Helena. - Helena! Beautiful Helena! Ouch! Oh, that's better. Thank you. Oh, beautiful. Yes, yes. You... Helena. She already understood me. I know Greek. I'm a genius. Countess, where have you been? We've been waiting. Your Majesty, I apologize for the delay, but Major B?ckl just told me that Dr. Seeburger has arrived to examine Your Majesty. Didn't you tell him that I don't have any time? We'll miss the boat. But, Sissi, Dr. Seeburger most likely has the order to report to Vienna. Franz will be worried if he doesn't get any news. Well, all right, then. We can take the next boat. Let's go, Countess. - I'll wait on the patio. - Yes, Mama. Hello, Dr. Seeburger. Did you have a good journey? Thank you, Your Majesty. His Majesty has told me to send his best wishes and immediately send report on Your Majesty's condition. But please keep it short, Doctor. I want to travel to Athens with Mama. Yes. Your Majesty only has to uncover her back. Countess, can you open my dress, please? Here you go, Doctor. Breathe in deeply one more time. May I ask Your Majesty to cough? One more time, please. Strange. How long has Your Majesty been in Corfu? Three months. Why? Incomprehensible. Has my condition become worse? On the contrary, Your Majesty. It is a miracle! Your Majesty is completely healthy! No. Healthy? Yes. Doctor, could you please listen one more time? - I want to breathe in one more time. - Most certainly. Do you hear anything? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. - Really? Nothing? Doctor! Doctor! One moment, please! Mami! Mama! Mama! Mami! Mami! Oh, my God, Sissi! What's wrong with you? Mami! My child. For Heaven's sake, what is it? Are you not feeling well? - Mami. - What is it? I am healthy. - What? - Yes, I am healthy. - I am happy. - Oh, my God. Franz, excuse me, but I need to be the first one to tell you this. What is it? A miracle has happened. Sissi is healthy. Sissi! This is the most beautiful day of my life. I will definitely go and meet her halfway. I would love to come, too. May I take the opportunity to express my best wishes for the recovery of Her Majesty? I thank you, Excellence. Your Majesty, may I also express my heartfelt wishes for the recovery of Her Majesty? I cannot tell you how happy I am. The plan of Your Majesty to travel toward Her Royal Highness is of great political importance. I wanted to say the same. For example, if the reunion is combined with an official visit to Milan and Vienna, that would be a great move concerning the relations between Austria and Italy. Even Your Majesty once chose to say that the charm of Her Majesty is of more use to the country than the army with all its generals. Yes, but Excellence seems to forget that Her Majesty has just recovered from a very grave sickness, and therefore might not be able to cope with the stress of a representative journey. Certainly, Your Majesty. But the relations between Austria and Italy are at the moment so bad that one must make every sacrifice to better them. Yes, I must agree with the Minister, my dear Franz. If you travel towards Elisabeth, the journey must have an official character. But, Mama! I know what you want to say, Franz. Sissi certainly needs time to recover. But she is also an Empress, and the first duty of an Empress is to do everything possible for the good of the country. Gentlemen, I am more than shocked. The Italian population is so anti-Austrian that I believe a visit by the Emperor and the Empress gives reason for serious doubt, and I have invited you to Trieste to discuss which precautions to take as a result of this situation. Please take a seat. I believe Your Majesty is looking at it too negatively. Besides, there is nothing we can do about it now. The visit is announced; therefore, it must happen. Furthermore, I trust in our beautiful Empress. She also won over the Hungarians with her charm. My dear Count Zettor, the Italians are no Hungarians. Please tell us, Your Majesty, which city shall be the first for the Emperor and the Empress to visit? Milan will be the first city. There you go. Nothing can go wrong there, Your Majesty. We will have a beautiful presentation in the Scala of Milan. Afterwards, a reception with a good meal, and everything will be just fine. - Good evening, Mayor. - Good evening, Excellence. Tell me, who are these people? I was just about to announce it to you. They're all servants, maids, cooks, stable boys and butlers. How is that possible? The Italian noblemen that were invited by the Governor General have given all of their invitations away. What an insult! I sent the wife of my doorkeeper. And I, my cook. And I, my coachman. - Carlo will tell us everything. - Why Carlo? I have told him he has to go to the opera and give us all the details. That's great! Do you know, Carlo, that today you are the only Italian nobleman in the Scala? - I knew that before I came. - You knew that? Excellence, I am absolutely shocked! - What is it now? - The people have something planned. They want to use the presence of the Emperor and the Empress, and the orchestra's supposed to take part in it. - Well, what is their plan? - I could not find out. - Send for the conductor immediately. - Certainly. - The conductor. - Right away. The man is to be immediately arrested and replaced by a reliable person. Excellence, I would not do that. The musicians might not play at all, then. What could they have planned? Maybe they will refuse to play the Austrian anthem when the Emperor and the Empress enter. But that would be... The people had to promise their masters and mistresses to refuse any kind of respect to the Emperor and Empress. That's impossible! Oh, you will see how possible it is. Excellence, Their Majesties have just arrived. Thank you. What is this? From Verdi, from the opera Nabucco. That is infamous! That is treason! - Arrest the conductor at once! - At your command. Stop playing at once! On the contrary! We've just started! - You're under arrest! - One moment, please. - Come with me. - Yes, but first I have to conduct. This is the Italian aristocracy? My wonderful husband has sent my maid, my cook and all of our servants to the opera. Now I must do all the work myself. I've already been to the cellar three times. Oh, I would have enjoyed going to the opera so much! But, Beatrice! Yes, yes. The one time an Emperor comes to Milan, a young Emperor, and I have to sit here. But you're Italian! No, I'm not Italian. I am a mixture. Yes, I was born in Hungary. My mother was Polish. My father was Russian. My grandmother was Swedish. A great uncle of mine was supposedly even an Eskimo. Oh, now I broke my nail. The Empress is applauding? The Emperor, too. I did not expect this. - Should I come with you now? - Begin the opera. Certainly. - Excellence. - But what is it now? By command of Her Majesty, the reception is to take place. What? With these people? With these people. The Empress is of the opinion that only those people that have been officially invited are also present. - I don't understand. - I don't understand, either. Principessa Corinne! It is a pleasure, my dear Princess, to get to know you. I have heard a lot about you. Prince de Colona! Contessa Celine! I am pleased to see you here, dear Contessa. I have heard a lot about you. His Excellence, Minister retired, Orlando! Marquesa de la Forre! Principe Aldo Bandini! Good evening, everybody! - Good evening, Carlo. - Finally! There he is! - So, how was it? - Fantastic! Don't eat now! Tell us, what was fantastic? Well, Mariari sang! It was splendid! And the Tuscan! We are not interested in how the opera was. - No, what about the Empress? - Yes. The Empress! She looked like a dream! And the dress she wore! I have never seen anything like it! And the Emperor? What did he wear? A uniform, of course. - And what did he look like? - Magnificent! You see? We don't want to know what they were wearing. We want to know whether the Emperor and the Empress left the opera right away when they saw our people. On the contrary! They stayed until the end. - Oh, no! - They stayed? What? The Emperor, too? Of course! And the reception... The reception was phenomenal. - The reception took place? - Yes. Have our people attended the reception? - Yes, all of them. - It's only us who weren't! And in the end, your servants were as enchanted by the Empress as I was. Moreover, you will all be mentioned in the paper tomorrow. What does that mean? Of course, only those of you who were introduced to the Empress. Us? Introduced? But we were all here! Yes! Yes, that was a curious story. I don't know whether it was a misunderstanding or a mistake, but all of your people were introduced under your name. Oh, no! What? My cook was introduced under my name? And my doorman's wife was introduced under mine? Correct! The Empress was especially gracious. For example, to your cook she said: "My dear Princess, I have heard so much about you. I am very happy to finally meet you." Excuse me? Now the Empress believes that I look like my cook! - Darling, it's all the same. - No, it's not all the same! Why should she tell the relatives that I grew so big? I have always had such a slim waist! But the Emperor was a little surprised by the appearance of the coach driver, who was introduced as Principe Orlando. That leaves us with only one solution. We will all go to the next reception and clear up this confusion. Unfortunately, you won't have the opportunity to do that. The Emperor and the Empress are leaving Milan tomorrow to go to... Where? To Venice. This ostentatious silence is more crushing than an assault. You shouldn't be surprised by the attitude of these people. They know your name only from death penalties that others have passed for you. Yes, you are right. So many mistakes have been made. Radetzky was too strict. My brother was too permissive. That's why I told you not to take this trip. I wanted to spare you this humiliation. But the worst is yet to come. The passage from the Piazetta to St. Marcus' Church. I wish I could spare you that. Don't worry about it, Franz. The journey to Madeira was much more difficult, and I gladly made it for you. What a wife Heaven has sent me! That's our child! That's my surprise for you. I've got you back! My sweetheart! You've grown so much! Mami will never ever go away again. Never! Sissi. Forgive me, Your Eminence, that I did not greet you first, but I did not know whether I would see my child again in this lifetime, and I was so happy about it. Blessed are the people whose hearts overflow with joy, because this joy comes from God.
