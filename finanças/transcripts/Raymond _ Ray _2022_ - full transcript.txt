[rain pattering] [door closes] [car door closes] [engine starts] [muffled trumpet playing] [trumpet stops] [trumpet resumes] [occupant] Who's there? - Raymond. - [occupant] "Raymond" who? - [footsteps approaching] - How many Raymonds do you know, Ray? Our father is dead. By his own hand? No, not by his own... He was sick, for Christ sake. Can I come in? Put the gun away, Ray. You know I don't like guns. Then you shouldn't knock on people's doors in the middle of the night. Well, I tried to call, but your phone was dead. I'm behind on bills. You want, uh, something to drink? Coffee. Coffee. When was I last here? Three years? After Athena's surgery. Oh, that'd be five. Really? Shit. So, who called you about the old man? I mean, who even talks to him anymore? Uh, Reverend West, his pastor. [chuckling] Harris has a pastor? Are you shitting me? Yeah. His last wish was that his sons attend his funeral. It's tomorrow, Ray. Outside of Richmond. You don't have to go. He's dead. He'll never know. You're a very tender man, you know that? [grunts] So what's your plan? I'll leave early, before dawn, but, uh, I can't alone. I... I don't... I don't have a license, Ray. I got a DUI. - [chuckles] - I had two beers. The first time I've been pulled over in 20 years. I had to drive here tonight 'cause I couldn't reach you, but if I get stopped, I could be in deep shit. Why doesn't your wife just drive you? We're on the rocks. She left me in December. [sighs] Ho, ho, ho. [chuckles] [sighs] Why did you say "by his own hand" before? Why would he kill himself? I guess I just always thought he would. Such a bitter son of a bitch. Frustrated. Everything he touched turned to shit. Just thought he'd put himself to sleep one day. I fantasized about it my whole childhood, him putting a gun in his mouth and blowing off the top of his head. Jesus. You're really gonna go? After the things he did to you? [thunder rumbling] You still working at the plant? No. Fired. For what? I don't know. Some altercation. [chuckles] "Altercation"? Fancy. If I asked the other guy, would he use that word? Hmm, it's difficult for him to speak with no teeth and all. - [sighs] - What was it about? [sighs] Nothing. What was it about, Ray? Uh... [mumbles] Uh, he used the N-word. I told him not to. It escalated. Wh-What are you doing for work now? Construction. Here and there. I have two days this week, which is another great reason to skip a funeral. I saw a woman leaving earlier. She a keeper? [sighs] You playing any gigs? Nah, I haven't played a gig in forever. Why not? You're sounding good. I don't play anymore. I heard you when I was knocking on the door. - No. - I heard it. I don't have any horns anymore. Sold 'em. You sold your horns? It's okay. No work and no horns? Sounds like dicey territory. I'm fine. Still clean, going on seven years. Wow, that's great. I-I'm proud of you. What, is this where we hug? - Hug this. - Oh, fuck. [chuckling] You know, he does have other wives. You can get them to go. Nah. Remember that Serbian woman? B... Branka. Branka... Oh, wow. Good memory. Shit, she was hot. I must have jerked off to her a hundred times and so did you. - No, I was too busy getting laid. - Oh, you're full of shit. - How did he get himself women like that? - He could be funny when he wanted to be. Does whipping our asses with his belt count as funny? 'Cause if it does, he was a hoot. Ray. I wanna be there. Not because he asked, but because I want to. I wanna know what it looks like to put him underground, what it feels like. But I'm scared it's gonna kick my ass. Come with me. J... Wait one second. Oh, really, is that necessary? You never know. [clears throat] Keys... You got it. [exhales sharply] Where are we? 'Bout a hour and a half out. [sighs] I was having a dream I was in a natural history museum. [clears throat] There was one of those theater-like windows. Remember those? The naked cavemen killing a man with... Your mom used to take us. Mmm, no. That was your mom. My mom hated that place. Said it gave her the creeps. No. Didn't your mo... mom… Oh, maybe you're right. Uh, anyway… I'm in the museum and Dad... Harris is one of the prehistoric men. [chuckles] Yeah. So I'm tryna break the glass, tryna get him out, tryna free him. But I look down, and… [stammers] …I'm naked too, like the other cavemen. [sighs] What do you think it means? Means it's gonna take a whole lot more than a hole in the ground to get the old man out of your head. It's hard to imagine him as a little boy. His father was a monster to him. We repeat. We repeat. - We don't have to. - Yeah, but we do. It's the law of the land. Mmm. Were you a monster to your boy? Oh, hey... [sighs] I'm sorry. [sighs] [cell phone rings] Hello? Reverend West? How are you? Yeah, we're on the road. Uh, do we come straight to you, or… All right. You can give him this number. - That it for you? - Yep. - It's a cool store. - Thanks. Is it yours? Yeah, right. Do I look like a boss lady to you? Yeah, you sure do. [cashier] It's like most girls in the South. - So, like, I decided to rebel a little. - [Ray] Really? - That is amazing. - [laughs] [Ray speaks indistinctly] [Ray sighs] What was that about in there? Nothing. They just come to you, don't they? Like flies to shit. [grunts] [engine starts] Reverend West called. How long have they even known each other? I mean, Dad died alone, I bet. This guy just stepped in to make it all a little less desperate and depressing. And this is what the end looks like when you've alienated everyone. And now they've called us in to be the shills. You don't have any good memories of him? I have some. I wish I didn't. Why? [cell phone ringing] Hello? Raymond. This is Mr. Can field from Remembrance Funeral Homes. Oh, yes. Hi. First off, let me say that I am very sorry for your loss. Well, thank you. I met your father briefly a couple of years ago, when he was making arrangements. Very charismatic. A sensitive soul. My condolences. Wh-What kind of arrangements? He wanted to have an open casket. Um, that requires embalming, of course, and we need to start on that right away if we want to have an early afternoon viewing, which is what he requested. Okay. [chuckles] The thing is, your father prepaid for the casket and the headstone and a deposit on the embalming, but he never paid the balance. - I know in this difficult moment it's... - [stammers] How much is it? - I'm sorry? - [Raymond] That's my brother, Ray. Here. Uh, nice to meet you, sir. I'm sorry for your loss. [stammers] How much is it? All in, with taxes, it's $475, and that includes cosmetic work. Wh-Whoa, you talking 'bout makeup? Yes. We would like to prepare him so that the experience is as rewarding... Yeah, that's a bullshit expense. We don't need that. We don't need to see him. [stammers] Excuse me, I didn't... I didn't catch that. Please, go ahead with it. We'll settle up when we get there. Also, a Mr. Mendez, your father's attorney, called earlier to see how things were going. - And I will text you his number now. - Okay, thank you very much. See you soon. Harris's attorney? I mean, $500? Can you afford that? - No, but we only do this funeral once. - [mumbles] - Let's do it right. - But I can't afford it. - I'm not gonna pay. - I'll do it, Ray. Is that all right with you? Jesus Christ. [cell phone chimes] Pu... Put it on speaker. [line ringing] [Mendez] Max Mendez. Yes. Uh, Mr. Mendez, my name's Raymond. M... Uh, my father was Ben Harris. - Yes. I'm very sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Your father was an exemplary man. A very charming man too. [chuckles] Yeah, he will be missed. I am sure of it. You... You wanted to talk with us? Yes. Unfortunately, I have another client waiting for me. Um, could you come by a little later? There are some things to go over. Is your brother Ray with you? Yes. - Good. 11:00? - [Raymond] 11:00 is good. I will text you my address. And as your father used to say, à bientôt. À bientôt? You remember he made us go to those French lessons, and then he changed his mind and pulled us out? I really enjoyed those. Thank you. Sorry. [people chattering, sobbing] Sorry. [clears throat] I'm looking for Mr. Can field. - Hi. That's me. - Oh. You're Mr. Raymond Harris? - Yeah. - Hi. Pleased to meet you. - This is Ray. - Hi. [Can field] Rose, find out how long until Mr. Harris is ready. [Rose] I'm very sorry for your loss. [Can field] So, you have a good trip? Y-Yes, thank you. Mmm, where do you make your home? Couple hundred miles from here. Mmm. You resemble your father. Mr. Harris will be ready in a few minutes. Felix will come looking for you. Great. In the meantime, I want to show you the casket that your father pre-selected. If you'll follow me this way. Thanks. Um, if you don't mind waiting right here, I'll be right with you. Really? The cheapest man who ever lived. I believe it wasn't a matter of cost. I offered him discounts on other caskets, but he insisted. He said it was his favorite thing about being a Jew, the humility of the casket, which brings me to my question. I know he was close with Reverend West, but perhaps you would also like a rabbi to attend? - That won't be necessary. - No. Our father was not a Jew. - He converted for 30 minutes once… - Right. [stammers] …and... No, and he was still miserable. No rabbi. Thank you. [Felix] Mr. Harris is ready. I'm sorry for your loss. I worked on him a little. He was quite, um, emaciated. Yeah. Well, thank you. How'd he die? Well, you would have to speak with his physician about that, but I believe the death certificate mentioned congestive heart failure and cancer of the lung. Y-Your father's wish was to be buried naked inside the casket. I suggest he wear a shirt for the viewing, if you could provide one. Will you be expecting a large group of people? Why, I don't think so. [Can field] Well, we'll leave you alone with him. When did you last see him? [Ray] Maybe at one of your weddings. Oh, he only came to my wedding with… with Marsha. Yeah. He called your brother-in-law a retard, remember? Then your father-in-law almost attacked him. I mean, that reception was one punch from a shit show. It wasn't like that. Don't rewrite history, Ray. Was he always this little? What's this shit about being buried naked? [mumbles] He was always such an exhibitionist. His dick is still bigger than ours. [Raymond] It was really something seeing him lying there like that. He's really gone now. I feel it. I feel good about it. Letting it go. Forgiveness is good. [Mendez] Come in. Come in, men. [chuckles] So good to finally meet you, to put faces to the names. - Well, thank you for meeting with us. - Of course. Sit, please. Coffee? Water? - No, we're good. - No, thanks. You know, it's funny. I heard him say so many times, "My sons, my children, my boys." How, um... How long did you know our father? [Mendez] About seven years. I represented a man who was suing him for slander. - Huh. - And my client won that case. Your father was so impressed by my work that he hired me to help him sue the city of Bon Air. [Raymond] For what? Christmas wreaths on City Hall. He said it violated the separation of church and state. How could he even afford you? I worked for him pro bono. Your father was a great conversationalist, a ferocious debater. Not sophisticated necessarily, but tireless. I would pay him just to hear him gripe about the world the way he did. Okay. Your father's last will. [sighs, clears throat] He leaves all his assets, it's about $5200 in a checking account, to be divided equally among his sons that attend the funeral. I know it doesn't sound like much, but maybe it can help with the funeral expenses. Travel expenses, perhaps. Or you can throw a reception for the attendees afterwards. It's up to you. Your father also left you some personal items at his home. Here is his address. And, uh, Ms. Delgado will be there all day. - Ms. Delgado? - Yes, sir. And lastly, it was also your father's wish that you dig his grave. What? That his sons dig his grave on their own, without machinery. Shovels are fine, of course. And then, you are to lower the casket into the ground and cover the grave again. - What an asshole. - No, Ray. - No… - No, no. [stammers] Is this even allowed? The cemetery must accommodate all faiths. Your father claimed his Tongan roots demanded it. 'Cause of our Tongan roots. - Yeah. - Here's the permit. When you get there, please identify yourselves to the funeral director so that you can dig. Make sure to bring a valid driver's license. [Raymond] Hi. We're, uh, Harris's sons. I'm sorry for your loss. [Raymond] Thank you. What is that? - What? - What you did. Oh. D... Nothing. It looks like something. What is it for? I-It's just a bad habit. It makes you feel better? It's all good. You are safe here. Your father's room is upstairs, the last room. I'm cooking something. - Lucia. - Ah. I'm Raymond. - This is... - [Lucia] Raymond and Ray. You're safe here, buddy. What's that? His little altar to himself. Hey, look at this. [both chuckling] Who the hell are they? I don't know. [Lucia] Are you guys hungry? Oh, no... no. We're... We're... We're fine, thank you. - [Ray] We're good, thanks. - [Raymond] Thanks. I'll get your boxes. Oh, look. The moms. So beautiful. [chuckles] Before he sucked the lifeblood out of them. Fuck. Hey, it's just like Christmas. Yeah, except we're not kids. - [imitates suction, chuckles] - [sighs] Are we not? We're a couple of grown-ass men whose lives didn't pan out. - Don't say that. - Mmm, it's the truth. Hey, you're pissing me off. - Whoo! Easy, horse. - Hey, fuck you, Ray. - Don't say my life hasn't panned out! - I like you angry. About fucking time. [scoffs, sighs] Oh, n... [sighs] Thank you. Thank you. Looks good. [Lucia] Mm-hmm. Mmm. This is delicious. [Lucia] I know. [Raymond] How long have you worked here? It's my house. Oh. I love the way you've set it up. [stammers] Very free-spirited and... and yet still sensible. [laughs, spits] Thank you. Was Harris your tenant? No. My ex-husband and I had a car wash. Harris came to the store for cigarettes. He was older, but he was friendly and a good listener. We were lovers for a while. Then we stayed friends. And when he got sick last year, I moved him in. He looked at that picture of you guys at the lake all the time. I said to him, "Why don't you call these boys? They can visit you." He said no. He said, "The boys and the men were not the same thing." [Lucia singing in Spanish] [sniffs] [chuckles] Is it one of yours? Yeah. Uh-huh. He took it from me after one of our big fights, summer of senior year. He told me he pawned it. [chuckles] Must have scoured every pawn shop in the States. I mean, he was always an asshole to me, but that was the beginning of the end. What was the fight about? I have no idea. He had that cleaned and fixed just a few weeks ago. I had no idea you thought my life was shit. - That's not what I said. - I heard what you said. - You said my life hadn't panned out… - I... - …which is one way of calling out failure. - No, I... - I like things the way I like them. - I... Steady. Maybe that makes me boring or lazy. It cost me my marriages. I know that. Olive said I was more interested in air conditioning than I was in her. The first time Marsha saw me ironing a perfect shirt, she burst into tears thinking I was gay. [chuckles] I like my peace and quiet. If that means my life didn't pan out, then it didn't pan out. I'm okay. I sleep like a baby. We come from chaos. I hope everything is satisfactory. [Ray] Mmm. Yeah, it's fine. Thank you. It looks good. We will have to begin our move to the cemetery in about an hour and a half in order to make his desired time for the burial at sunset, allowing for the time to dig. Mr. Mendez spoke with you both about your father's wishes with respect to that? He did. I think we'll be fine. Oh, goody. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Bonnie. Michael. - Who's Michael? - Oh. Uh, it's often uncomfortable for mourners to be the first to arrive and find an empty room. You know, the deceased by himself. So, sometimes we, you know, place a couple of people just to sit in. At... At no cost to the family, of course. And then, as the room begins to gradually fill, they will step out discreetly. - Great. - Yep. Um, I'll need you to sign some documents in my office, though. Um, yeah, and I'll need your driver's license. [chuckles] Try not to fuck the funeral home receptionist at our own father's viewing. Okay, I'll try. You're cold as ice, Pops. [breathes shakily] [sobbing] [sniffling] All right, thank you. You can go. Thanks. Shoo. [breathes deeply] [speaking Spanish] Unfortunately, I can't stay longer. Oh, don't worry. Thank you so much for coming. No, I'm happy to be here. Yeah. That didn't sound right, huh? [chuckles] [chuckles] Look at you. You have a good smile. It's open. It does not lie. Oh. Are you married? Kids? I'm separated. Um, twice divorced before that. Wow. [chuckles] And… how many kids? Oh, um… I have a son. [stammers] He's in the Army, um… And uh... Wh... You don't want to talk about him? No, it's fine... [stammers] How long are you guys in town? If you need a place to sleep, his room is available, of course. Oh, thank you. But I don't think I could sleep in that room. Why? The hospital bed is gone and everything's going to the Salvation Army or to the trash. - Is that what he wanted? - Yeah. He left everyone something, and that's it. The rest must go. Oh. But if you want anything like, I don't know, photos of you guys or your moms, it's okay for me. - Hi. - [chuckles] I will see you later. Yeah, okay. Mmm. [sighs] [groans] Do I know you? I don't think so. [attendee] You sure? Yeah. So why you look at me like that when I walk by? Like what? - You think I enjoy it? - No, I... I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from. Wait, you, um... You reminded me of someone. Oh, you think I should be flattered, is that it? [attendee chuckles] [sighs] I'm sorry about gawking at you out there. That was a crappy thing to do. [sniffs] Yes, crappy and creepy. [chuckles] Well, I will endeavor to stop behaving like an asshole. - Okay. - Okay. I'm Ray. That's my father, Harris. Kiera. I was one of his nurses at St. Anne's. My condolences. You always come to your patient's funerals? - No. - Huh. He asked me to. He said it gave him comfort to know I'd be here, and I'm happy to do it. Something about your father captured me. A very old soul. Haunted. What was he like as a father? The worst. Huh. I wouldn't have guessed that. But then again, no one was there towards the end except his friend Lucia. So, that explains that. - Are you having a burial? - Oh, yeah. We're digging the grave ourselves, my brother and I. His final request. Why would he want you to do that? Mmm. Your guess is as good as mine. - What's yours? - Trying to screw with our heads. Exercise his power over us for as long as possible. You can always refuse. Yeah. We didn't. - Well, then it worked. - [chuckles] [Kiera] He was ready to go. Even declined painkillers. He wanted to go out with all his senses. I think music helped him get through a lot of it. He'd... He'd put on his earbuds and plug into his phone and close his eyes and weather the pain. I asked him, I said... I said, "What music is that?" He said, "Oh, it's a secret." But at night, when I came in to check on him, I could tell it was the same song over and over again. He'd fall asleep listening to it, when he could. What song? Um… I don't know. Something instrumental. Bluesy, maybe. I should get going. Oh, uh... Are you gonna be at the... The cemetery later? No, I-I-I wasn't planning on it. Oh, right. - Don't think I can. - Of course not. Nice meeting you. [sighs] Hey, I need you to call that Mendez, the lawyer, right? I wanna find all Dad's personal belongings. You know, all the stuff he left at the hospital. - What for? - I just... [sighs] I want his cell phone. You won't be able to use it past the billing date. No, not... It's fine, all right? Just call him. Thank you. [sighs] Oh, fuck. [sighs] Mr. Mendez. It's Raymond. Yeah. Do you know what happened to our father's personal effects a-a-at the hospital? Okay, I... We'll try that. Thank you. - So, what'd he say? - He had no idea. - Ah, f... - He said to ask... He said to ask Lucia. She'll be at the cemetery. - All right. Well, did you get her number? - What? Wha... [scoffs] Call him back. Get her number. - What's up your ass? - Just do it. [sighs] - Voice mail. - [groans] Fuck! You son of a bitch. You think you can laugh at me from hell, huh? What the fuck do you know about music? [breathing heavily] It takes you 80 years to discover that it can help you through your pain, huh? You moron. Don't fuck with me, Harris. You'll regret it. Call me. - [sniffs] - [groans] God. [Raymond] Imagine if the moms were here now. - [Ray] Uh, I'd rather not. - Why? They'd get all tangled up. Oh, not my mom. No, when she shed him off, I think she shed him off for good, like changing skin. [clicks tongue] The shit he got away with. I mean, can you imagine? I mean, his wife and his lover become lifelong friends. [mumbles] It's like the Battered Wives Club. Well... [grunts] He was just a guy, Ray. I mean, I know he could be a real asshole, and he could I-lose control, but... Well, he... Shit things happened to him too. No, it's no excuse. You know, he should take responsibility for his own life. It's his life, his responsibility. Yeah, like our lives are our responsibility. Oh, God. Why won't you point the finger at him? - What good would that do now? - Just face the facts. - I face the facts. - No, you don't. - Oh, fuck off. - I mean, he fucked your wife. - Thanks for reminding me, Ray. - What, you forgot? Oh, fuck you! Fuck you! Pull over! Pull over. I'll walk the rest of the way and dig the fucking hole myself, you piece of shit. Your anger, Ray. I couldn't carry it. It would crush me. [cemetery worker] Good afternoon. I'm with Cederdale Cemeteries. - I'm very sorry for your loss. - Oh, thank you. I took the liberty of removing the grass to mark the area. Okay. Thank you. [cemetery worker] This flat blade is gonna make things easier for you later. This pickax for harder areas, rocks too. H-H-How deep? Six feet. Right. I'll be around here if you need me. Thanks. [blows] Why are there no dates? - [Can field] It's what he requested. - Did he say why? [Can field] He did not. Get to it. [soil scraping] Gentlemen. Rev. West. It's great to finally meet you, despite the circumstances. My condolences. Thank you. - Mr. Can field. - Reverend West. Harris spoke about you men many times, always in glowing terms. - Yeah. - Hmm. - [grunts] - Some backbreaking work. [laughing] Did I say something funny? [scoffs] "Glowing terms." "Backbreaking work." It's just, where do you get that shit? Are my words shit? I mean, do they teach that at divinity school? How to speak like a prophet? I apologize for my very unhappy brother, Reverend. - Ah. [scoffs] - [grunts] No worries. A difficult day for all. But what's he even need a pastor for anyway? The last time I checked, he was Jewish. He was Buddhist before that. Muslim. Harris was a restless seeker. He was circumcised at 50. That's enough. I did not know that. Painful, I'm sure. What about the dates? How come there are no dates? He was never sure about his birthday. Didn't want the stone to be wrong, so he opted for no dates. [stammers] Who would know or care if it was wrong? [stammers] Few things matter to a dying man. This mattered to him. Just keep it secular as best you can. Huh, Rev.? I'm a Christian pastor, Ray. [clicks tongue] [in Spanish] That's them, my love. - [Ray groans] - [soil scrapes] [Reverend West, in English] Let me help with that. - Thank you, Reverend. - Mm-hmm. Thank you very much. Mr. Can field. Ms. Delgado. Hi, guys. This is my son, Simon. Raymond and Ray. Your brothers. [Simon] Nice to meet you. Hello. Hey. Over there. [chuckles] [Lucia] Thank you, Reverend. - [Ray] Hey, can I ask you something? - Yeah, of course. My father's stuff back at the hospital, do you know where that is? At home. What are you looking for? His cell phone. [sniffs] Harris left that to Simon. Yeah. Simon, come here. Show your brother the phone. You got any music on here? Not yet. Just reset it today. [Lucia] He's a techie. Hmm? - So, you don't have any of Harris's stuff? - No. Did you back it up? No, what for? [chuckles] Thanks. [soil scraping] - Mmm, a whiskey priest, hey. - [sighs] Don't judge me, Ray. Just a fellow like any other, running on feet of clay. Mm-hmm. Is that how you and Harris found each other? Mmm. Nah. Harris stopped drinking before I met him. He said it revived him, being sober. He was in his late 60s when he fathered that boy. [imitating sword sounds] Life is unstoppable. [chuckles] And no, that is not from divinity school. - You got a family, Ray? - Ah, no. I wouldn't know what to do with a kid. Especially a boy. Is a girl any easier? 'Cause I got a girl and… [laughs] …taken years off my life. What is it about a boy? Back off, Reverend. [Ray] Got a question for you, though. You really think that Harris believed in God? - I don't care. - No, come on. You're shitting me. What matters is that we all belong to something greater than us. An infinite. Your father knew that. No. That is a humble thought, and my father didn't have a humble bone in his body. Maybe he grew one when he realized the end was near. Yeah, maybe it's easier at the end. That's when all the bullies shit their pants. [chuckles] Nah, he was never scared. Only sad that the wonderful ride was over. That's how he put it. "The wonderful ride." [scraping continues] [sighs] Talk to me, Ray. What about? What for? It's all gonna be over, a couple hours. [chuckles] You sure about that? [clicks tongue] Oh, yeah. - [pants] - [Ray] I got it. [grunts] That boy, he bugs me. No reception here. That makes sense. [chuckles] Where do you work? Water and Power Department in Cincinnati. It's not very exciting. [chuckles] You don't like it? Find something else. I don't know. You can have stability with an exciting job. Risk makes you feel alive. Sometimes even getting a little sloppy can be good. - Can it? - Yeah. [laughing] You are so funny. Ah… I drive an Uber four days a week, and I am a bartender three nights. The driving is easier, but the bar is more money. Both jobs give me a front-row seat to the human circus every day. [grunting] Sunscreen. The sun is a silent killer. Keep going. [sighing] [breathing shakily] [Lucia singing in Spanish] [singing continues] [gasps] [panting] [in Spanish] Simon, please! Don't do that here! [in English] Nobody cares. [in Spanish] Incredible. [in English] Stop. S... [groans] It's my turn. I'm not sure that's going to be possible. I mean, legally I would need to... Come on. It's his birthright. Yeah, I think it's okay. Here. [sighs] Mr. West? - Reverend West. Yes? - Sorry we're late. - One of our flights was delayed. - You're not late. Um, Leon? - Leon. - Leon. - Leon, Vincent. - Yeah. Raymond. Ray. That's Simon over there. Condolences. Our sympathies. [Raymond] Thank you. Harris and our mother were custodians at a community center - in Tallahassee in the '90s. - [Vincent] Tallahassee. [chuckles] Simon. [in Spanish] Come meet your brothers! - [in English] I met them already. - There's more. Let me know when they're all here. They have to dig too. - [Leon] Hmm. - [Vincent] Hmm. Look at Ray. He's all... What is the expression? Um, tied up. Tied up in knots, huh? [chuckles] Both of you. The old man was always screwing with us. Gave us the same name. So our moms called us Raymond and Ray to avoid confusion, but he'd just call me Ray and him Raymond and wreak havoc. Ray would get rewarded for my stuff or I'd get punished for his. Or he'd go see one of his games instead of mine. I-I was a good athlete, but Ray sucked. I mean, he was a genius student. Straight A's. But he sucked at sports. The old man would start fights with the referees or the other dads. Drive our mothers crazy, but he loved it. Having us all bouncing around like pinballs. Ray took it the hardest. He's a recovering addict, and at his worst, he was a train wreck. [stammers] I tried to... to reach out to him to help, but he wouldn't let me anywhere near him. He was so embarrassed, the state he was in. He vanished. And then he found a woman who helped him turn his life around. And then she died. I mean, son of a bitch. I made him come here with me today. This is like ground zero for everything he hates. Thanks for coming. [chuckles] I didn't wanna miss... - Yeah. I mean, who would? - [both chuckle] Who are they? Oh, they're Harris's sons too. - Oh. - Yeah. Even the kid. - Little guy? - Yeah. Lucia's. - Wow. Go, Harris. - [chuckles] - How many brothers are there? - Uh, I have no idea. I just met them today. - Oh. - I mean, except for... for Raymond. You close to him? We're half brothers. Growing up, we were connected at the hip. Inseparable. And then, we drifted apart through high school. When you've been humiliated together, degraded, devalued like we were by Harris, then just being near each other is a reminder. But over the years, we stayed in touch. You know, he's... he's good about that. I'm always reluctant, but, uh, I never regret it. Sometimes I wonder if... if... If we met today, if we'd even be friends. I mean, he likes this kind of thing. Rituals. Rituals are comforting. Yeah. I mean, "I'm sorry for your loss." I've heard that a dozen times today. It starts to sound like, "Have a nice day," you know. - Or, "Pass the salt." Or… - Hmm. - [groans] - [sighs] I'm just... My wife had this, uh, aggressive cancer, so I let her parents, you know, have complete say in the funeral arrangements. I just... I just couldn't deal. They had everything organized and choreographed. So much pomp and circumstance and solemnity standing in for sadness. I hope it did them some good. It kicked my ass. I'm entertaining you with stories of other funerals, you know. Suave. I don't need to be entertained. Mom! Look at these guys! They're acrobats! - Hup! - [both] Hey! [Simon] Come on! Do some more! I think that's enough, little man. Come see us sometime. - [Simon] Please? - [Lucia] Simon! Oh, come on. There's nothing wrong with a few tricks. Right, Reverend? In honor of Simon's late father. I think it's okay, if everybody agrees? - Okay. - [Simon] Thanks, bro! [Vincent] Here we go. Ready? Hup! Here we go. Hup! - Whoo. - [all cheer] Bravo! [strains] - There we go. Settle it. - Ah! Uh-huh. - There it is. - [all cheer] Bravo, bravo, bravo! Coming down. Benches. Here we go. And… [Reverend West laughing] - Simon, come on in. - Come on in. [Vincent] Hands up. Hand up here. Step on here. - Okay? Step up. - [Leon] Very good. There we go. - [chuckles] - [Vincent] Good. Nice and easy. - Step on his shoulder. Good. - [Leon] Good. [Vincent] Style with a smile. Hup! - [performers] Hey. - [Raymond] Yay! [all laugh] - [Ray] Bravo. Solid. - [Kiera] Hey. - Nice. - [Vincent] Coming on down. [Vincent, Leon] Three, two, one. Go. - Wow. - [Reverend West laughs] - Oh, bravo! - There he is. Mi amor. Shouldn't we talk to these guys, get to know them? And then what? Birthday parties, Christmas cards? I don't need any new people. Ah, yeah. You're plenty busy with all the friends and loved ones that surround you. Athena died on me. The rest is by choice. [Leon] You have anything to drink? - Uh, yeah. I mean, they're warm. - Oh, that's fine. - Thanks. Oh! - Thanks. - [Raymond] When do you guys head back? - Tonight, by bus. We have a show in Charlotte tomorrow. [Raymond] Did you see the old man often? Oh, we never met him. He wanted us here anyway. But how long were they together? With your mom? Oh, not long. A week or two. Vincent and I are fraternal twins. Our stepdad, he's our true father. He'll wanna hear all about this. He'll get a kick out of it. Uh, no offense. [Leon] Hmm. You guys were close to him, right? - Oh. - Oof. - Thanks. - Cheers. Yeah. Okay, let me get a picture of everybody. Uh, please. Go. - Ray, Ray, you too. You too. Please. - No, I-I-I... Kiera, Mr. Can field. Ay, get it there. Come on, Ray. [speaks Spanish] You too, twins. Mmm. Grave man, sir? [laughs] Join us. You too. Perfect. Smile. Scooch in, everybody. [laughs, speaks Spanish] - [shutter clicking] - Perfect. One more. The last one and… good. Thank you very much. Much as gracias. - Thanks for putting up with that. - [chuckles] No worries. Yeah, it's something you can tell your grandkids about. Do you have kids? No, no. Never wanted to. Usually, people feel weird meeting a... A grown-ass woman who doesn't have or want kids, like she's some unhappy freak of nature. Yeah. There's many ways to live a life. I read that in a fortune cookie. [chuckles] It's light. Is he even in there? Oh, your father was down to 125 pounds. Wow. I had a dog once that weighed more than that. You remember Wilson, Raymond? Our dead dad weighs less than a dog. Shut up, Ray, or I'll kill you. Hey, do your part, boy. Reverend West, I want Simon to see his father for the last time. I don't think that's a good idea. Ms. Delgado, the time for viewing has passed. My son was at school, and he couldn't come to the funeral home. He's entitled. Miss Delgado, Mr. Harris has been traveling by car in this pine box… - Mm-hmm. - …naked and unprotected. He's been sitting in the heat for three hours. And he was just carried to this spot, possibly banged up along the way. The body takes a toll. He's embalmed. I still don't recommend it. I insist, actually. I'll take a look and see if he's okay. I'm sorry, but legally, you are not next of kin. [scoffs] Can't you do this for your brother, please? - W... I... - Raymond? I mean, Simon, do you wanna see the body? - Okay. - He did not want this. Let us take a look first. Mr. Can field. Okay. Jonas. [both straining] [Ray gasps] Oh, my God. He's faced own. Why is he faced own? It's what he requested, but he did not want anyone to know. That's why I was hoping not to open the casket. He was very adamant about this. W... Well, what does it mean, Reverend West? I have no idea. Oh, it's some bullshit attempt to make amends with the universe. You know, some final gasp at hokey atonement. - We see through you, Harris! - Shut up, Ray. - Lucia, did you know about this? - No, it's stupid. [laughs] - Let's turn him over. - We cannot do that. He's dead. Flip him over. Lucia. Ju... Let the boy take a look. Then we'll proceed, okay? [Lucia] Mm-hmm. I can't really see him. [Can field] Okay. - W... No... Oh! Oh! - Ah! [Simon] He looks uncomfortable. [Lucia, in Spanish] Okay. Enough. [in English] Jesus, he's pathetic. You know, in a way, it makes sense. It's the way he lived his whole life, faced own like a loser. - Don't talk about him like that. - He is a loser. - And everything he touched turned to shit. - Oh, shut up! Shut up, Ray! Come on! You fucking hated him, Raymond. - And he deserved to be hated. - Stop it! - What will it take for you to say it? - Shut up! Why can't you say it? Fuck him! - Shut the fuck up, Ray! - Fuck our father! - He fucked your wife, Raymond. - [Reverend West] Ray, no! And the boy you thought was your son was his son. - How's that make you... - [Reverend West] Stop! - Come on, Raymond. - [Vincent] Hey, hey, hey. Come on. - Raymond, Raymond. Let him go. - [both clamoring] [Vincent praying in Hebrew] [Reverend West] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespassed against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Harris wanted me to encourage anybody who wanted to speak. "No pressure," he said. Ray? Oh, uh, no. - [Reverend West] Lucia? - No. [Reverend West] Raymond? [breathing shakily] [sobbing] [breathing heavily] - [grunts] - [Reverend West] Raymond. - Stay! - Raymond. It's all right. I'll get him. Raymond. Come on. - [panting] - [Ray] What are you doing? Raymond! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - [grunts] - [Leon] Raymond. - [Reverend West] Let's talk. - [Kiera] Oh, my God. - [groans] - [gun cocks] - [Reverend West] Raymond. - [all] No! [Vincent] No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop! [sobs] [screams] [screams] [panting, sniffs] [thuds] [sniffles] [Can field] We must report this, West. To the police. [Reverend West] No. Look, it's gonna be a whole ordeal. Just be practical, my friend. The outcome's the same. [Reverend West] Ray. Say your goodbyes, Ray. You will never regret it. [breathing deeply] [crying] Oh, fuck me. Now what? [trumpet playing] [playing blues melody] - [soil scraping] - [Raymond grunting] Rest in peace, Harris. Leave behind fear, hope, anger, spilled milk. Take silence only. Sky, wind. Sunrise after the rain. Forget the rest. Sleep, Harris. Rest from yourself. Take care. Your father left you a letter to be delivered at this moment. Uh, I'm sorry, sir. That's the wrong one. Thank you. Okay, this stuff is going to the shed for charity. This other stuff is going to the garbage. After that, I'll make up a bed for you, and you are gonna sleep like a king. [Lucia singing in Spanish] Hey, folks. I'll have a Corona. Okay. And for you, sir? I will have a coffee, black, and a cherry pie, warm. - You want ice cream with that? - Uh, yeah. And for dessert? You don't drink? No, I'm an addict. But enough about me. [both laughing] No, I was a heroin addict for three years. It wasn't pretty. My brother said that one of the things he needed to do to stay clean - was finding new sources of pleasure. - Mmm. Because the drugs, for better or worse, were pleasure. Yeah. Well, that's true. I mean, when that drug first hits your body, - there's nothing like it. - Mmm. You know the sound of, uh, nails on a chalkboard? Heroin is that sound stopping. It's all the pain in your body, the little rattle in your head, it's gone. It's just the numbing of all that feeling. That's the pleasure. So, now pleasure's more muted, you know. There's food. Um, sex. Not bad. Uh, humor. You know, just all the normal things that bring people pleasure. Music. When it's not bringing me pain. [chuckles] Nothing... Nothing makes me happier than listening to jazz. It's a drug. Listening more than playing? You sounded pretty good back there. - Hmm, for a white boy. - You're not a boy. You know jazz? No, no. But I like it. [grunts] My father used to say that jazz was just Negro tribal music promoted by Jews to make cash. - Harris said that? - Yeah. Yeah, he has lots of winners. "Work is not something you should enjoy. If you had any real talent, it'd be written all over your white-trash face." - [gasps] Charming. - [chuckles] The things he said, they're like a... A weight on my chest. You know, it's like I'd be playing, and in between phrases, I can feel my… Tank's not filling up, you know, from the weight. Um, my whole life, just tried not to get crushed. Playing back there at the cemetery, that's not like a-a-a real gig with other musicians. That's when the fear rears its ugly head. Fear of what? Sounding like crap. Thanks. Appreciate it. Yeah, I got ya. You have a picture of your wife? Uh, yeah, yeah. [grunts] Wow. She was beautiful. So, when you're done eating, we're gonna go get you high. [jazz band playing bebop] I'm finished with the shed boxes. You show me where the dumpster is? Dinner first. Well, I'd rather get it over and done with. That was weird today. [Lucia] Don't be rude. Thank you. [imitating trumpet] [imitates gun shots] [whispering] Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo. [both chuckling] [Lucia singing in Spanish] [grunting] [groans] [gasps] Did you love him? He was a horny 67-year-old. And I was in a bad marriage and sad. And he gave me attention. And he made me laugh. He was a bad father to you, a good father to Simon. He was a bad lover to your moms. He was a good lover to me. He loved women, but he didn't understand them. He was a racist who liked everyone. He ate 10,000 meals and slept 10,000 nights with his dreams and his nightmares. He had a hundred jobs and no money in the end. He wanted to understand the world, life, everything. But no. [chuckles] Who can? He was a speck of dust. [speaks Spanish] What does it mean? Onwards. [both moaning] [sighing] The real thing is better. [bebop continues] [speaking indistinctly] [band playing cool jazz] [trumpet playing melody] You know what? I think I'm gonna walk. [clears throat] Where to? I don't know. I was just gonna walk, you know? - You want company? - It's all right. Do you even know your way around here? I'll be fine. What's going on? Nothing, you know. Just been a long day and, uh, I'm done. - You're done? - Yeah. Look, don't be weird. Just... Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey! What the hell happened? Did I say something? Clear it up for me, and I'll walk away. - Look, it's not about you. - What'd I do? Look, I'm not your pet project, Nurse Kiera. I'm such an idiot. You know what? People tell you who they are right away. My first impression was the right one. You're a prick. Well, you're right about that. Shit. Hey! Shit! Hey! Oh, fuck. Hold it! Shit! Just hold on. [panting] Can I talk to you, please? Kiera, just give me two seconds, all right? Can you roll down the window for... J... - [engine starts] - No, hey, hey, hey! Please, just two seconds, all right? - [siren blares] - I, uh... Oh, f... [sighs] - Everything okay? - [Kiera] Yeah. You sure? I'm fine, thanks. You know this guy? [Kiera] Mm-hmm. Yeah. He's cute. [mouthing] Fuck you. [Harris] Raymond, I regret that I caused you so much pain. I was in a lot of pain myself, but I've heard that's no excuse. It was exhausting work being a father, even a bad father. Find a way to forgive me. One more thing. Your brother Ray, is not my son. His mother was already pregnant but didn't know it when she and I started up. We went along with it because I loved her, I thought. So, in a way, he's not even your brother, I suppose. Do with that information what you will. I trust you. Your father, Benjamin Reed Harris III. [Harris] Ray, you were a golden boy. I never knew what to do with you. Sincerely, Benjamin Reed Harris III. Oh. She invited me to stay a few days and I-I-I'm going to. So, y-you take the truck. Wait, are you sure? I mean, I can take the bus. Yeah. I'll pick it up from your house this weekend. All right. Did you and, um, Lucia… What? What, what? - Oh, my God. [chuckling] - Ah, just cut the shit, Ray. Holy shit. [gasps] You had sexual intercourse with his woman, bro! Why do you have to point everything out? Why can't you let silence speak for itself? Where would the fun be in that, huh? - Now his son could be your son. - [laughs] Jesus! Fuck. Oh. [grunts] [sighs] Um… I is ten, you know, um… Thank you for making me come to this thing. Is this where we hug? - Oh, hug this. - Hug this! [shushes] [chuckles] Hey. We never really knew him, did we? [sighs] Let's talk this weekend. Yeah. - ["Love Me Till I'm Gone" playing] - [volume increases] [song continues]
