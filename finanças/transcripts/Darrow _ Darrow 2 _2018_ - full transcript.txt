IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY, ONE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS? [MILES]: DON'T WORRY, PHOEBE, WE'VE GOT THIS. LOOK, I DON'T THINK I'M THE ONE YOU NEED. YOU ARE. I HAVE NEVER DEFENDED A MURDER TRIAL BEFORE. ISN'T THERE SOMEONE MORE QUALIFIED THAN ME? YOU'RE THE BEST TRIAL LAWYER I HAVE EVER SEEN. WELL, THANK YOU, BUT STILL... SO HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. SHE WAS SEEN ENTERING THE YASBECKS' OFFICE AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER. THEY GOT A SEARCH WARRANT. THEY SEARCHED HER CAR. THEY FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON. A BERETTA M9. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO SURE IT'S HER? THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO SURE. THEY'RE TESTING HER HANDS FOR GUNSHOT RESIDUE RIGHT NOW. LOOK, CLAIRE... I KNOW MY SISTER. I KNOW SHE'S INNOCENT. YOU'RE GOOD AT DEFENDING THE INNOCENT, RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE HER THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU. AFTER I CHECK ON LOU. THANK YOU. SO YOU THINK YOU'RE UP FOR THIS CASE? NOT REALLY. I DO. HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. [CRACKING] [JOANNA]: SHE IS GOOD. I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY GOOD. I KNOW! HER DAD TAUGHT HER TO HIT LIKE THAT. OH, NOW I SEE. SO BASEBALL IS LOU'S WAY OF STAYING CONNECTED TO THE MEMORY OF HER FATHER. THAT'S NICE. YEAH. WHEN SHE WAS FOUR, SHE COULD NAME EVERY BASEBALL TEAM AND EVERY CITY IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE. SHE COLLECTED THE CARDS. SHE KNEW ALL THE STATS. THE STATS? ARE YOU KIDDING? YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S HOW SHE GOT INTO MATH, WHICH LEAD TO ENGINEERING, WHICH LEAD TO ALL THE A.P. CLASSES. WE OWE IT ALL TO BASEBALL. WELL... I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF GUYS STANDING AROUND, WAITING FOR FLY BALLS. THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT. YEAH, UH, COULD'VE FOOLED ME. LOU. SHE YOURS? UM... YES. NOT BAD. NOT BAD? SHE'S THE BEST PLAYER YOU'VE GOT. OH, YEAH? CHARMING FELLOW. BYE. [SNICKERING] ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO GO. WISH ME LUCK. ALL RIGHT. GO GET 'EM, TIGER. YES, I FOUGHT WITH TERRY DURING OUR LAST SESSION, AND YEAH, I HAD A DIFFERENT PRODUCER LINED UP. DID YOU THREATEN TERRY YASBECK? I DON'T KNOW. I MIGHT HAVE. I MEAN.... I WAS MAD. TERRY HAS A WAY OF GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN... OR... HAD. WELL, YOU WERE OVERHEARD THREATENING TERRY IF HE DESTROYED YOUR ALBUM. YEAH, I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I'D SAY. I MEAN, SUPPOSE SOMEBODY THREATENED WHATEVER YOU CARE ABOUT MOST? OKAY... THE CLERK AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE ACROSS THE STREET SAID HE SAW YOU TRYING THE DOOR TO YASBECKS' STUDIO AROUND 1:00 IN THE MORNING. SAID HE RECOGNIZED YOU. YEAH, I MEAN, I... WE ALWAYS BUY ENERGY DRINKS FROM HIM. I WAVED AT HIM, AND THEN THE DOOR WAS LOCKED, SO I WENT AROUND BACK. THE SECURITY CAMERA SAW YOU DRIVE UP AND GO IN THE BACK DOOR. I KNOW. I TOLD YOU. I WENT TO GO GET THE CONTRACT. SO THAT DOOR WAS UNLOCKED? YEAH, SO I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WOULD BE WORKING THERE, BUT THE WHOLE PLACE WAS JUST QUIET. TERRY WASN'T THERE. I MEAN, AT LEAST, I DIDN'T SEE HIM. SO I WENT INTO HIS OFFICE, AND I GOT THE CONTRACT FROM HIS FILES. I EVEN LOOKED THROUGH HIS WHOLE COMPUTER. WHAT FOR? FOR MY ALBUM, FOR THE TRACKS. AH, OF COURSE. I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. DID YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT? NO. [MILES]: PHOEBE... YOU WERE THERE AT THE EXACT TIME OF THE MURDER. AND TERRY'S WIFE SAID SHE HEARD HIM CALL YOUR NAME ON THE PHONE. I MEAN, EVEN IF I WAS THERE, I WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD THE SHOT ANYWAYS. THE WHOLE STUDIO'S SOUNDPROOFED. I SWEAR, I JUST WENT HOME. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? YOU'RE INNOCENT. YOU'RE INNOCENT. THEY'LL SEE THAT. IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. LAST NIGHT, THAT ALBUM WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO ME... AND NOW, I MEAN... I CAN ALWAYS JUST RE-MAKE IT... UNLESS I'M IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I'M FACING, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. OKAY? AH. ARE YOU READY TO PLEAD GUILTY? NO, I DIDN'T KILL TERRY. SHE DIDN'T KILL TERRY. DISTRICT ATTORNEY ASHLAND, HOW ARE YOU? NOT TOO HAPPY TO SEE YOU ON THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE, MILES. [CLAIRE]: WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE. WE ALL WANT TO FIND THE TRUTH. MAN, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING ABOUT HER, WERE YOU? WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME? I SAID NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS. PLUS, SHE'S RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE GUNSHOT RESIDUE TEST ON THE SUSPECT'S HANDS. IT CAME BACK POSITIVE. [CLAPPING] [COACH]: THAT'S IT, FELLAS! COME ON, WAKE UP! WAKE UP OUT THERE! WHY ISN'T HE PLAYING HER? LOOK AT HER. SHE'S SO DISAPPOINTED. WAIT, WAIT A SECOND. I THINK HE'S GOING TO GO TALK TO HER. - OKAY. OH, I'M SO NERVOUS. - HE'S TALKING TO HER. - [CLAIRE]: I'M SO NERVOUS. - [JOANNA]: IT'S OKAY. I MEAN, SHE'S GOOD, RIGHT? YEAH, BUT THIS IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. OH, YOU MEAN LIKE YOU WITH THAT CASE? YOU'RE NOT HELPING. SORRY. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE GOOD, YOU'RE GOOD. OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? COACH, PUT HER IN! [COACH]: COME ON, FELLAS! HUSTLE UP, KEEP ALERT. JERK. [CLAPPING] HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO TRACK THE SERIAL NUMBER ON THE GUN? THEY HAVE. IT BELONGS TO A CATHERINE HUDDLESTON. SHE'S AN OLD-TIMER, LIVES OUT THERE ON QUANDER ROAD. SAYS SHE CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME SHE SAW IT. BUT SHE HAS NO CONNECTION TO YOUR SISTER? NOT THAT I KNOW OF. WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING. [PHONE RINGING] [SCOTT]: HELLO? [CLAIRE, ON PHONE]: SCOTT? YES, CHIEF. HEY, I NEED YOU TO TRACK A... CATHERINE HUDDLESTON. A CATHERINE HUDDLESTON. - FIND OUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN-- - TERRY YASBECK. AND SEE ABOUT HER CONNECTION TO TERRY YASBECK OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THE CASE. YOU GOT IT. HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. YEAH? SO PHOEBE'S ALBUM, ALL RIGHT, THE TRACKS, PHOEBE'S ALBUM... NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AT TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO, AND APPARENTLY, THIS GUY KEPT EVERYTHING, WAS A REAL CONTROL FREAK, RIGHT? HE HAD BACK-UPS ON BACK-UPS, AND EVERYTHING THEY DID ON THE COMPUTERS OVER THERE, HE DIDN'T LET GO OF ANYTHING. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ALBUM? I DON'T KNOW, I... EITHER TERRY DESTROYED IT, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, OR... SOMEBODY STOLE IT. OR SOMEONE STOLE IT. VERY POSSIBLY THE SAME PERSON THAT KILLED TERRY. BUT WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? IT DOESN'T... IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING TO ANYBODY BUT TERRY. AND PHOEBE. SHE SAYS SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT. SHE ALSO SAID SHE DIDN'T KILL TERRY YASBECK. I KNOW... I KNOW SHE DIDN'T, BUT... IF I'M A D.A., WHICH I AM, AND I'M THINKING LIKE A D.A., WHICH I AM, SHE LOOKS GUILTY. WELL, I'M THINKING LIKE A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, AND I KNOW SHE'S NOT. THANKS FOR SAYING THAT, AND ALSO, THANK YOU FOR... YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. ALL RIGHT. AND DON'T YOU FRET. I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS, OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. THANK YOU, MRS. DARROW. MM-HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES THIS LEMONADE CASE SO HARD? HAVING TO WATCH A LITTLE GIRL SOB HER EYES OUT? WELL, YEAH, THAT, AND HAVING TO ACTUALLY TASTE THE LEMONADE. THEY SWEETEN IT WITH STEVIA. IT'S A TERRIBLE AFTER-TASTE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE STEVIA. HUH. YOU PROBABLY LIKE CILANTRO, TOO. YES, I DO. WELL, TAKES ALL KINDS. HEY, WHERE'S CLAIRE? SHE'S WITH MILES, MEETING WITH PHOEBE'S PRODUCER. I... I THOUGHT PHOEBE'S PRODUCER WAS DEAD. I MEAN, ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE PROBLEM? THERE'S A NEW PRODUCER. OH. SHE HAS A NEW PRODUCER? WELL, LUCKY GIRL. EXCEPT FOR BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER? WELL, YEAH, EXCEPT FOR THAT. CHESTER LIME. I WAS WONDERING IF TODAY WOULD BE A GOOD DAY TO DISCUSS OUR CREATIVE SYNERGY EXPLORATION? [JOANNA AND RAYMOND]: NO. OH. OKAY. TERRY YASBECK WAS AN ABUSIVE JERK. ASK ANYBODY. EMOTIONALLY, PHYSICALLY... I MEAN, IF PHOEBE KILLED HIM, IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENSE. SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED? NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M JUST SAYING TERRY WAS AN ANGRY, DANGEROUS PERSON. I MEAN, IF I SAW HIM COMING AT PHOEBE, AND I HAD A GUN, I'D PROBABLY SHOOT HIM MYSELF. DID YOU? NO, OF COURSE NOT. YOU SEEM AWFULLY PROTECTIVE OF PHOEBE. LOOK, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. SHE'S A VERY TALENTED SINGER, AND I WANT TO PRODUCE HER ALBUM. DID YOU SEND HER FLOWERS? YES, I DID, BUT JUST TO THANK HER FOR SIGNING WITH ME. BUT YOU DO HAVE A PARTICULAR REASON FOR WANTING TO KILL TERRY YASBECK, DON'T YOU? YEAH, OKAY. YOU'RE REFERRING TO LINDA. YEAH, TERRY WAS MARRIED TO MY EX-WIFE. RIGHT, SO WE COULD SAY YOU HAVE MANY REASONS TO WANT TO KILL TERRY YASBECK, DON'T YOU? [CLAIRE]: WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE EVAN HAS MORE THAN A PROFESSIONAL INTEREST IN YOUR SISTER. WHY DID YOU STOP ME? I HAD HIM ON THE ROPES. WE'RE NOT IN COURT. WE'RE NOT EVEN TAKING DEPOSITIONS. WE'RE JUST GATHERING FACTS. AS A D.A., YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BLIND FAITH. IS THAT WHAT YOU DO, CLAIRE? YOU JUST HAVE BLIND FAITH? ACTUALLY, JUST FAITH, BUT YOU CAN CALL IT BLIND JUSTICE. BESIDES, NOW WE KNOW EVAN CARLTON'S IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER. ABOUT THAT... IF HE IS, THEN WHY... DIDN'T PHOEBE TELL US THAT? MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW... OR MAYBE SHE'S PROTECTING HIM. HEY, SCOTT, HOW ARE YOU COMING ALONG WITH CATHERINE HUDDLESTON? STILL LOOKING INTO IT. OKAY, WELL, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST INVESTIGATOR I HAVE. I WON'T DENY THAT, BUT THANKS FOR THE VALIDATION. I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT WHAT CAN CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE ON A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST. RIGHT... I'M ON IT. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I HAVE THEM OCCASIONALLY. YEAH, DO THAT. I DON'T WORK FOR YOU. NOT YET. [CLAIRE]: PLEASE, GUYS, OKAY? SO NOW WE NEED TO GO TALK TO PHOEBE'S BACK-UP SINGER AND HER ENGINEER TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT. I'LL BRING THE CAR ROUND. OKAY. HEY, CHESTER? YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND A COMPUTER, RIGHT? WE HAVE A CERTAIN RAPPORT. I WANT YOU TO SEARCH TERRY YASBECK'S COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE MURDER. THAT'LL TAKE DAYS, AND THE POLICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH IT. ARE YOU COMPLAINING? NO, JUST DEFINING IT. ACTUALLY, IT SOUNDS KIND OF FUN. GREAT, AND, CHESTER, I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECOND ON THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I JUST... AH... MM. SCOTT! WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT LEAVING YOUR LAW BOOKS ALL OVER MY DESK? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOUR DESK? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHARE THIS DESK. THIS HALF IS MINE. WELL, THEN WHY DO YOU LEAVE YOUR DANISH ON MY HALF? STOP BEING PETTY! YOU'RE BEING PETTY! THEY'RE LIKE THIS 24-7. MAYBE WE DO NEED TEAM-BUILDING EXERCISES. JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES STARTS WITH A SINGLE DANISH. NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY OF PHOEBE'S TRACKS. TERRY WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEM. HE KEPT THEM ALL ON HIS COMPUTER. THEY AREN'T ON ANY OF TERRY'S COMPUTERS. OR ON THE HARD DRIVE AT THE RECORDING STUDIO. OH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT... YOU KNOW, UNLESS TERRY WAS GOING TO DELETE THE WHOLE ALBUM. [NORAH]: WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM. HE ERASED ALL THE MUSIC I RECORDED WITH HIM. HE WAS JEALOUS OF MY TALENT. THIS IS MY WIFE, NORAH. SHE'S ALSO THE BACK-UP SINGER ON PHOEBE'S ALBUM. THAT'S ME, JUST A FEW FEET FROM STARDOM, BUT IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO PHOEBE. YEAH. [JONAH]: I HATED TO HAVE TO TELL THE COPS WHAT I'D HEARD, BUT I COULDN'T LIE, COULD I? YOU COULD'VE LIED. UH, NO, HE COULDN'T. WELL... BUT SHE'S DIDN'T MEAN IT WHEN SHE THREATENED HIM. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SAY. RIGHT. [NORAH]: I MEAN, LOOK, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR PHOEBE BEGGING HIM, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HER BACK-UP SINGER. I'D BE A WAITRESS SOMEWHERE. YEAH. PHOEBE EVEN SAID SHE'D TAKE ME WITH HER WHEN SHE WENT TO EVAN CARLTON. EVAN CARLTON... DID YOU SUSPECT SOMETHING MORE... PERSONAL... IN PHOEBE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EVAN? I NEVER THOUGHT SO. [NORAH]: SHE COULD DO WORSE, BUT NO, I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING. WELL... YEAH. - THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. - YEAH. [NORAH]: YOU UNDERSTAND, PHOEBE'S A FRIEND. I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S NICE TO HEAR. WHAT I MEAN IS, IF YOU WANTED ME TO TESTIFY THAT PHOEBE WAS WITH ME THAT NIGHT, I'D BE HAPPY TO. WERE YOU WITH HER THAT NIGHT? WELL, NO. OKAY, WELL, WE COULDN'T ASK YOU TO LIE TO PROTECT PHOEBE. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PERJURY. RIGHT. I SEE. WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO PROTECT HER. YEAH, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN? OUR PLAN IS TO FIND THE TRUTH. RIGHT. OKAY... BUT YOU KNOW THAT SHE KILLED HIM, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT? [MILES]: WELL, THAT HAS YET TO BE PROVEN. WELL, THANKS. IF WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE? MM... I THINK IF I HAVE ANY MORE COFFEE, I'LL BE UP FOR A WEEK. NOT THAT I CAN SLEEP ANYWAY. WELL, YOU HAVE TO DRINK SOMETHING. YOU HAVE TO STAY HYDRATED. OKAY, FIRST OFF, COFFEE IS A DIURETIC. SECOND, REALLY, CLAIRE? THAT'S MY PROBLEM? MY PROBLEM-- MY SISTER'S ON TRIAL FOR MURDER, AND I'VE GOT TO STAY HYDRATED? MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HANDLE WHAT YOU CAN, WHEN YOU CAN, AND RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN HANDLE STAYING HYDRATED. MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY, "PICK THAT UP!" I DON'T WANT ANYTHING. THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BUT GRAPE SODA. GIVE ME A GRAPE SODA, PLEASE. WHAT? OH, YEAH, I'LL HAVE A GRAPE SODA. I LOVE GRAPE SODA. WE HAVE GRAPE SODA? NO, I USED TO DRINK TONS OF GRAPE SODA AS A YOUTH. THEY USED TO CALL ME "THE GRAPE SODA KID". PLEASE. IT'S A WONDER YOU SURVIVED. YOU DON'T LIKE GRAPE SODA? I... NEVER TRIED IT. NEVER... YOU'VE NEVER TRIED... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE GOING TO TRY A GRAPE SODA RIGHT NOW. NO. RIGHT NOW, TRY A GRAPE SODA. NO. TRY IT FOR ME. OKAY... FINE. YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S GUILTY, RIGHT? NOT FOR A MINUTE. OKAY. YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE OF... ME? NO. NO, I'D FEEL BAD FOR YOU, BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY TELL YOU IF I THOUGHT SHE WAS GUILTY. SHE'S NOT. THANKS. MM... THAT TASTES NOTHING LIKE GRAPE. I KNOW. IT'S LIKE NO OTHER FLAVOR KNOWN TO MAN. IT'S EXCELLENT. WHY DO THEY CALL IT GRAPE? YOU'VE GOT TO CALL IT SOMETHING. THAT'S THE LEGALESE. MM. I KIND OF LIKE IT. [CHUCKLING] I KNOW, IT'S KIND OF AMAZING. IT GROWS ON YOU. SO... NOW WOULD BE A TERRIBLE TIME FOR A KISS... RIGHT? TOTALLY. YEAH. - SHALL WE WAIT 'TIL... - YEAH. - TILL OUR HEADS ARE CLEAR. - TILL OUR HEADS ARE CLEAR. RIGHT. YES. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELL... GOOD NIGHT, COUNSELOR. GOOD NIGHT. I'VE GOT TO GET MORE OF THIS STUFF. "IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER THING THAT I DO, THAN I HAVE EVER DONE; IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER REST THAT I GO TO, THAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN." THE END. SO HE WENT TO THE GUILLOTINE? YEP. FOR A GOOD CAUSE. NICE BEDTIME STORY, MOM. IT'S A CLASSIC. I LIKED IT. TOMORROW, WE START ON OLIVER TWIST. MOM? YEAH? I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL ANYMORE. WHAT? WHY NOT? ARE THE BOYS BEING MEAN TO YOU? NO, NO, THEY'RE NICE. WHAT, IS THE COACH GIVING YOU TROUBLE? I DON'T THINK SO. THEN WHAT IS IT? THEY DON'T MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF THE TEAM. YOU KNOW, THEY... THEY TREAT ME LIKE I'M SOMETHING SPECIAL. WELL, YOU ARE SOMETHING SPECIAL. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THEY TREAT ME LIKE I'M A GIRL. OH, HONEY... YOU ARE A GIRL. I KNOW, BUT I JUST... I THINK IT'D BE BETTER IF I QUIT... YOU KNOW, FOCUS ON DEBATE TEAM. DO YOU LIKE BASEBALL? I LOVE IT. THEN YOU SHOULD DO WHAT YOU LOVE. I GUESS SO. I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT. JUST SEE HOW IT GOES. YOU WERE LISTENING? WELL, IT SAVES TIME. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM. WELL, I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS. OH, SO THIS IS ABOUT YOU, NOW? IT'S ABOUT ME, HER, YOU. IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US. I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT COACH A PIECE OF MY MIND. ALL RIGHT, CAN I-- CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? CAN I STOP YOU? REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, AND I USED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN CATCH MORE FLIES WITH HONEY THAN WITH VINEGAR? YEAH, YOU KNOW, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ATTRACT FLIES? ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. JUST... LET ME TALK TO HIM. YOU KNOW THAT I WAS VOTED "MOST LIKELY TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS" IN MY SENIOR CLASS. YEAH, HOW DID YOU WIN THAT, ANYWAY? I WANTED IT. EASY. YEAH, I TOOK A LOT OF PICTURES OF THAT LAST SESSION. YOU KNOW, FOR PUBLICITY AND FOR THE ALBUM COVER. HERE THEY ARE. DID ANYTHING STRIKE YOU AS ODD ABOUT THAT LAST SESSION? YOU MEAN ASIDE FROM TERRY BEING A ROYAL SLEAZEBAG? HE HAD HER SO UPSET THAT SHE FIDGETED WITH HER MIC STAND ALL THROUGH THE SESSION. YOU CAN EVEN SEE THAT IN THIS PICTURE. I SWEAR, IT'S AS IF HE LIKED TO SEE HER CRY. WHAT DID HE SAY TO MAKE HER CRY? SPECIFICALLY? HE SAID SHE HAD NO TALENT AND THAT SHE WAS NOTHING WITHOUT HIM. OKAY, BUT... CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL HIM? ONLY EVERYBODY WHO EVER MET HIM. RIGHT. THAT NARROWS IT DOWN. THANKS. SO, WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE LAST RECORDING SESSION? I'VE TOLD YOU, NO. TERRY WAS ABUSIVE, BUT THAT WAS NORMAL. DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT MUCH TROUBLE WITH YOUR MIC STAND? I DON'T KNOW. TERRY HAD ME SO RATTLED. I WAS-- I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH EVERYTHING. THINK. PLEASE. UM... I GUESS IT WAS A LITTLE... I DON'T KNOW, SLIPPERY. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SWITCH IT OUT FOR ANOTHER ONE? I KNOW IT'S SILLY, BUT... THAT PARTICULAR STAND WAS KIND OF A GOOD LUCK CHARM. I ALWAYS USED IT, AND EVERYONE WOULD KID ME ABOUT IT, BUT WHEN I STOOD IN FRONT OF THAT STAND... I COULD REALLY SING. HMM. IT LOOKS LIKE AN ORDINARY MIC STAND. I KNOW, BUT LOOK AT THE COLOR PICTURE. YOU SEE THE THING ON TOP THAT YOU USE TO TIGHTEN IT? IT'S RED. THE CLIP? YEAH, YOU KNEW THAT? YEAH, I KNEW THAT. WHAT, YOU DIDN'T? NAH, I HAD TO LOOK IT UP. I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU. WHY ARE WE LOOKING FOR THIS? I DON'T KNOW. IT IS JUST A HUNCH. YEAH, WELL... ALL RIGHT. HUNCH IS GOOD. HUNCH IS ALL WE HAVE. AH! WHAT? I JUST... I SWORE I WOULDN'T LET HER DOWN AGAIN, AND NOW, HERE WE ARE. YOU SAID THAT EARLIER... AND PHOEBE SWORE THAT YOU NEVER DID LET HER DOWN. WELL, SHE... SHE'S BEING KIND. SHE WAS... WHEN MY DAD AND HIS WIFE DIED, SHE WAS JUST A TEENAGER, YOU KNOW, AND... THAT'S A ROUGH TIME TO BE AN ORPHAN, AND I WAS STARTING OUT AS A LAWYER, YOU KNOW, HUNGRY, GOT TO SUCCEED, SO I WASN'T REALLY THERE FOR HER, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST NOT THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AND SHE GOT IN TROUBLE, LOST HER WAY. MM, I'M SORRY. YEAH. THEN... YOU KNOW... SHE DISCOVERED MUSIC... YOU KNOW, DISCOVERED THIS, AND IT... IT SAVED HER. YOU KNOW, SHE CLEANED HERSELF UP, STARTED OVER. I WAS STARTING TO MAKE MONEY AS A LAWYER, SO I COULD PUT HER THROUGH A FINE ARTS COLLEGE. THAT WAS NICE, YOU GAVE HER... I MEAN, YOU HELPED HER THERE, RIGHT? RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS AFTER THE FACT. YOU KNOW, TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. SHE SAVED HERSELF, WHICH IS WHY I NEED TO SAVE HER NOW. I OWE HER. I REMEMBER WHEN MY FATHER DIED. I SWORE I WOULDN'T LET HIS FIRM GO UNDER. AND... YOU DIDN'T. YEAH... AND YOU... YOU WON'T LET PHOEBE DOWN. THANK YOU. SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE, UM... WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. A MIC STAND. OH, UH, WE HAVE LOTS OF THOSE. NO, NOT... NO ORDINARY MIC STAND. THIS ONE. UH... WOW, YEAH. YOU RECOGNIZE IT? UH, YEP, THAT'S PHOEBE'S FAVORITE MIC STAND. ISN'T IT HERE? NOPE, CAN'T FIND IT. WELL, THAT'S WEIRD. IT'S USUALLY RIGHT HERE. WELL, IT'S NOT HERE NOW. [MUTTERING] [STAMMERING] - UH, CAREFUL, PLEASE. - OH, SORRY. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY, IF YOU... GO OUT THAT WAY? YEAH, OKAY, GREAT. TERRIFIC. WE WON'T SIT ON THAT ANYMORE. OKAY. THANKS. THANK YOU. UH-OH, YOU'RE MAKING A FACE. WHAT'S THAT FACE? YOU HAVE AN IDEA? MAYBE. 'CAUSE WHEN YOU MAKE THAT FACE WHEN I'M A D.A., I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE 'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO WIN THE CASE. ARE YOU ABOUT TO WIN THIS CASE? LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES, BUT... LET'S SAY IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I LIKE THAT. YEAH, ME TOO. GOOD JOB! VINCENT. YOU'RE OKAY, FELLAS. EASY OUT, EASY OUT. HE'S STILL NOT PLAYING HER. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO TALK TO HIM. HE SAID SHE WAS ONE OF HIS BEST PLAYERS. NO, HE SAID THAT SHE WASN'T BAD. HIS TONE SAID SHE WAS ONE OF HIS BEST. YEAH, YEAH, HIS TONE WAS PRETTY POSITIVE. I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO HIM. WHAT DID WE DECIDE ABOUT HONEY AND VINEGAR? YEAH, I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM SOME VINEGAR. YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOOKED UP THAT SAYING, AND YOU KNOW WHO SAID IT? - WHO? - BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. NOW, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MOCK BENJAMIN FRANKLIN? MAYBE. SERIOUSLY? NO, YOU DON'T. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY, FELLAS, EASY OUT, EASY OUT. - GOOD GAME. - KIMINSKY, WARM UP. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE WHOLE TEAM. MOST OF THEM. MOST OF THEM, YES. MOST OF THEM. BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. NO, NOT ALL OF THEM. NOT LOU. NO, NOT LOU... PLAY THE BALL, PLAY THE BALL! AH, WHY HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED LOU? I'LL GET AROUND TO HER. OH, YOU WILL? YEP, DON'T YOU WORRY. IN WHAT INNING? YOU MEAN, WHAT GAME? WHAT, SO... YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE HER IN THIS GAME? DON'T THINK SO... COME ON, BLUE, THAT WAS INSIDE! DO YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS? A DISCUSSION? LIKE COFFEE? OKAY. OKAY... THIS WEEK? SURE. IT'S TWO-WAY, BOYS, TWO-WAY. WELL? WELL, IT'S WORKING. I MEAN, IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, BUT HE'LL COME AROUND. I GIVE HONEY ONE WEEK, NO MATTER WHAT BEN FRANKLIN SAYS. JUST TRUST ME. MS. DARROW WANTED ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WE ARE. SO, MY FIRST QUESTION IS... WHAT ARE WE? A LAW FIRM. WRONG. WE'RE A TRIBE. A TRIBE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER, CONNECTED TO AN IDEA, BUT I DON'T THINK WE REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER. SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AROUND AND TELL EACH OTHER THREE LITTLE-KNOWN THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES. YOU FIRST, ZOEY. WELL... I WAS BORN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I USED TO BE A MARINE. I SERVED A TOUR IN AFGHANISTAN. WOW. I DID NOT KNOW THAT. YOU NEVER ASKED. SEE? YOUR TURN, WINNIE. UM... MY FIRST NAME IS GODWIN. I KNOW, WEIRD. MY MOTHER WAS A HIPPIE, AND I'M AN EXCELLENT BOWLER. [CHESTER]: GOOD. JO... MS. DARROW. I SHOT A MAN IN RENO JUST TO WATCH HIM DIE. REALLY? THAT IS A JOHNNY CASH LYRIC. I CAN'T... DON'T YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW YOUR CLASSICS? [CHUCKLING] WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU. WHO'S NEXT? YOU ARE. NO, I'M THE MODERATOR. COME ON. - CHESTER. - FAIR IS FAIR. COME ON, CHESTER. OKAY. UH... I HAVE A SLIGHT CASE OF OCD. IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS TO GET THROUGH LAW SCHOOL... BUT I GRADUATED TOP OF MY CLASS. MY FATHER'S STILL ASHAMED OF ME. HEY, YOU GUYS READY TO GO TO THE PRE-TRIAL HEARING? EVERYBODY READY? [JOANNA]: GIVE THEM A MINUTE. THEY'RE BONDING. IT'S OKAY. I FOUND OUT SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO OWNED THE GUN. OH, MRS. HUDDLESTON, YEAH. YEAH, SHE USED TO BE A NANNY. AMONG THE CHILDREN THAT SHE CARED FOR... LINDA RUTHERFORD. USED TO BE LINDA CARLTON. NOW SHE'S LINDA YASBECK. TERRY'S WIDOW. EXACTLY. SHE GOES TO VISIT HER EVERY OTHER MONTH. SO SHE COULD HAVE STOLEN THE GUN? MANY TIMES OVER. YOU DID A GOOD JOB, SCOTT. DIDN'T I? OKAY, NOW, THIS IS JUST THE PRE-TRIAL HEARING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. JUST... BE HERE. RIGHT, AND LOOK INNOCENT. WHICH YOU ARE, RIGHT? YES! OKAY. SHE'S GOOD. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HER. I NEVER UNDERESTIMATE PEOPLE. GOOD. WHY, IS SHE BETTER THAN I AM? ARE YOU SERIOUS? NO, OF COURSE NOT! WHY DO YOU THINK I HIRED YOU, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE CUTE? - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. WAIT, YOU THINK I'M CUTE? YEAH. REALLY? EVERYBODY THINKS YOU'RE CUTE. SO, LIKE... - HEARING'S THIS WAY. - OKAY. I OBJECT. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE. THAT IS TRUE, MS. DARROW. I DON'T MEAN TO DISPARAGE THE STATE'S TEST. I ONLY WANT TO VERIFY IT AND EXPAND ON IT. YOUR HONOR, I DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE TO GO OVER-- I DON'T SEE ANY HARM. I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT. JUDGE BATCHELLER ALWAYS SAYS THAT AT FIRST. I KNOW, CHESTER. PAY ATTENTION. SO, DR. ARMSTRONG, IS THIS THE RESULT OF THE NEW TEST YOU ADMINISTERED ON PHOEBE STRASBERG'S HANDS? [DR. ARMSTRONG]: YES. THE TESTS WERE SOME DAYS AFTER THE EVENT, SO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ANY DEFINITE RESULTS. BUT YOU DID? I DID. I'M AN EXPERT. YES, I KNOW, WE ESTABLISHED THAT, AND WHAT WERE THE RESULTS YOU FOUND? THE RESULTS CAME BACK POSITIVE. [D.A.]: I OBJECT AGAIN. THIS MERELY CONFIRMS THE STATE'S EVIDENCE, AND IT'S A WASTE OF THE COURT'S TIME. I BEG THE COURT'S INDULGENCE, YOUR HONOR. FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES, MS. DARROW. THANK YOU. SO, IT CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR GUNSHOT RESIDUE? [DR. ARMSTRONG]: YES. [CLAIRE]: WHAT ELSE? OBJECTION! OVERRULED. BRAKE FLUID. BRAKE FLUID? LIKE, FROM A CAR? [DR. ARMSTRONG]: INDEED. IT COULD BE EITHER ONE. BRAKE FLUID CAN PRODUCE A FALSE POSITIVE IN A GSR TEST. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. SCORE ONE FOR MS. DARROW. [JUDGE]: ALTHOUGH THE DEFENSE HAS PRESENTED SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO THE VALIDITY OF THE GSR TEST, THE COURT FEELS THAT THE STATE'S CASE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO TO TRIAL. BAIL HAS BEEN SET FOR $500,000. [RAPPING GAVEL] I'LL FIND A WAY. SO, COACH REED... I FEEL FUNNY CALLING YOU COACH. WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU? COACH. REALLY? YOU CAN CALL ME JOANNA. JO? WHY NOT? LET'S TALK ABOUT LOU. WHAT ABOUT HER? DO YOU THINK SHE'S A GOOD PLAYER? COULD BE. IF SHE PLAYED MORE? COULD BE. SO WHY DON'T YOU LET HER PLAY MORE... OR AT ALL? I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU THINK I PLAY HER MORE? BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL. - THAT'D BE DISCRIMINATION. - YES, IT WOULD. SHE'S ON THE TEAM. TRUE. SO I'M NOT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST HER. NEXT QUESTION? I... GIRLS HAVE EVERY BIT AS MUCH RIGHT TO PLAY BASEBALL AS BOYS DO. OF COURSE THEY DO. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST AS STRONG. THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION, I GUESS. SO ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER GETTING HURT? I DON'T WANT ANY OF MY KIDS TO GET HURT, THE BOYS OR THE GIRLS. OH, SO YOU'RE PROTECTING HER, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT LETTING HER PLAY? IT'S A BOY'S GAME, JO. IT'S NOT "JO", IT'S JOANNA. NO, IT'S MS. DARROW, AND WHO SAYS IT'S A BOY'S GAME? EVERYBODY. I MEAN, FOR A GIRL TO REALLY BE ABLE TO COMPETE, SHE'D HAVE TO BE EXCEPTIONAL. OH! OH, SO SHE'D HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THE REST JUST TO GET TO PLAY? YEAH, I GUESS, BUT WHY GET HER HOPES UP ANYWAY? LET HER PLAY SOFTBALL, JO. THAT'S A GIRL'S SPORT. BUT SHE LOVES BASEBALL. I MEAN, WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME SHE LOVES? I MEAN, ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S GOOD AT IT, AND SHE IS GOOD AT IT... AND IF YOU'RE GOOD AT ONE THING, JUST ONE THING, THAT CAN AFFECT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, AND... IT CAN MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. YOU REALLY WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT? OKAY. I'LL GIVE HER A SHOT. REALLY? SURE THING. IT'S GOOD COFFEE. THE NEXT ONE'S ON ME. THANK YOU FOR BAILING ME OUT. OF COURSE. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO PAY YOU BACK. I'LL GET THE MONEY BACK WHEN YOU SHOW UP FOR TRIAL... RIGHT? RIGHT. OF COURSE. WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE? I KNOW THINGS DON'T LOOK GREAT RIGHT NOW, BUT CLAIRE IS THE BEST ATTORNEY IN THE STATE. I KNOW, BUT... JUST GOT TO HAVE FAITH. OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. I'M SORRY. IT'S NO PROBLEM. IT'S OUR SPACE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT ACTUALLY WORKED. HUH. CLAIRE? WHAT? YOU WERE ON ANOTHER PLANET. YOU WERE IN ORBIT THERE. DID YOU BRING ANYTHING BACK? NO. NO. DID YOU TALK TO MRS. YASBECK? YES, I DID. OKAY. SHE TOOK THE GUN AWAY FROM MRS. HUDDLESTON BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID SHE WAS GOING TO HURT HERSELF WITH IT BECAUSE SHE'S IN EARLY-STAGE DEMENTIA. SO MRS. YASBECK SAYS. SHE GAVE THE GUN TO TERRY, WHO KEPT IT IN HIS OFFICE. SO ANYONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THEIR HANDS ON IT. INCLUDING PHOEBE. UGH, SO WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE. DO YOU THINK SHE'S BEING FRAMED? I THINK THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES. ONE, SHE'S BEING FRAMED... AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THE SECOND POSSIBILITY... I CONSIDER ALL POSSIBILITIES. THAT SHE KILLED TERRY YASBECK? SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM. LOOK, USING OCCAM'S RAZOR... OH, OCCAM'S RAZOR AGAIN, I HATE OCCAM'S RAZOR. OKAY, THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES. THE SIMPLEST ONE IS THE MOST LIKELY. WHAT DOES OCCAM KNOW? I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THERE WAS AN OCCAM. WELL, THERE WAS. HE WAS A FRANCISCAN FRIAR. OKAY, WELL, NOW I FEEL BAD, BUT HE WASN'T A LAWYER. NO, NO, HE WASN'T A LAWYER. YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT, DO YOU? JUDGING BY THE FACTS, I THINK SHE DID, YES. BUT WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY? MY GUT TELLS ME THAT YOU REALLY WANT HER TO BE INNOCENT. - THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION. - I KNOW. CHESTER? HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING FROM YASBECK'S COMPUTER SYSTEM? JUST THAT I DON'T CARE FOR CONTEMPORARY MUSIC. KEEP LOOKING. UH, I THINK I MAY HAVE SOMETHING HERE. WHAT? YOU WANTED ME TO CALL DR. ARMSTRONG AND HAVE HIM ANALYZE THE BRAKE FLUID. WELL, HE CAME BACK WITH SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTING. IT'S A BRAND OF FLUID THAT ISN'T USED VERY MUCH ANYMORE, MOSTLY ON OLD MUSCLE CARS. UH-HUH... YOU'RE THINKING JONAH'S MUSTANG? I AM. OKAY... SO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE DELIBERATELY, SOMEONE PUT BRAKE-FLUID OIL ON HER HANDS TO CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE ON THE GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M THINKING. ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S TRACK THIS THROUGH, THEN. WHO WOULD KNOW THAT THAT WOULD WORK? UH... SOMEBODY WITH A BACKGROUND IN, UH... SCIENCE, CHEMISTRY, LAW ENFORCEMENT? OR HE COULD HAVE GOOGLED IT. THAT'S WHAT I DID. I HATE THE INTERNET. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OH, WAIT, SO... YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK THE BRAKE FLUID CAME FROM JONAH'S CAR? I'M JUST SAYING, IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT. ALL RIGHT. [RINGING DOORBELL] [KNOCKING] [RINGING DOORBELL] PHOEBE? MILES! UH, I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR JONAH. WE ARE TOO. WELL, THERE'S A SIDE DOOR. [COUGHING] OH, MY GOSH. JONAH! JONAH! OH, MY GOSH. CALL 911. HEY! HEY, HEY... HOW'S JONAH? IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT? NOBODY WILL TELL ME ANYTHING. HE HAS A CONCUSSION. HE'S GOING TO RECOVER, BUT IF WE HADN'T COME IN, HE WOULD HAVE DIED FROM CARBON-MONOXIDE POISONING. SO DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY HIT HIM ON THE HEAD AND THEN STARTED THE CAR TO KILL HIM? YES. CONSENSUS OF OPINION SEEMS TO BE THAT WAS YOU. I SWEAR TO GOD, I JUST GOT THERE WHEN YOU DID. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? I GOT A PHONE CALL. FROM WHO? I DON'T KNOW. THE NUMBER WAS BLOCKED. SO WHY'D YOU ANSWER IT? I JUST DID. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, YOU JUST DO. NO, I DON'T. I DON'T EVER... WELL, I JUST DID. OKAY. ANYWAY, WHO WAS IT? I STILL DIDN'T KNOW. THE VOICE WAS ALTERED ELECTRONICALLY. WHAT DID IT SAY? THAT JONAH HAD MY ALBUM. AND YOU BELIEVED IT? NO, OF COURSE, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. I STILL HAD TO GO CHECK IT OUT AND SEE, DIDN'T I? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE ALBUM. IT'S STILL TWO YEARS' WORTH OF WORK, OF SWEAT AND TEARS. I AT LEAST HAD TO GO TALK TO JONAH, JUST SEE IF HE HAD IT, AND THAT'S WHEN I RAN INTO YOU GUYS. SO THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN CORROBORATE THIS STORY IS AN UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON THE TELEPHONE? DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD, DOES IT? NO, IT DOESN'T. [MILES]: NOT SO GOOD, NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL GO TALK TO JONAH... YEAH. SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING HE CAN SAY ABOUT THIS. WELL, TELL HIM I SAY HELLO... AND THAT I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL HIM. YEAH, LOOK, PHOEBES... THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE OKAY. I KNOW YOU'RE LYING, BUT... THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. HANG TIGHT. I WAS LUCKY. YOU CALL THIS LUCKY? CALL ME A "SKULL HALF-CRUSHED" KIND OF GUY. ANOTHER FEW MINUTES, AND I'D HAVE BEEN DEAD. I LIKE THAT HALF-CRUSHED ANALOGY. HALF-CRUSHED IS GOOD, FULL-CRUSHED IS BAD. DID YOU SEE WHO HIT YOU ON THE HEAD? I DON'T REMEMBER. IT'S ALL KIND OF JUMBLED. DID YOU SEE PHOEBE IN THE GARAGE? I DON'T REMEMBER. DO YOU HAVE PHOEBE'S ALBUM? NO, OF COURSE NOT. WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT? I ASK YOU THAT BECAUSE... PHOEBE GOT A-- WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT, AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM AN-- - A ROBOT... - ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE THAT SAID YOU HAD HER ALBUM. WELL, I DON'T. WHO WOULD MAKE A CALL LIKE THAT? WE DON'T KNOW. DID ANYBODY ELSE HEAR THE CALL? - NO. - NO. WELL, THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW...? WE DON'T. WE... WE DON'T KNOW THAT PHOEBE'S TELLING THE TRUTH. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO HAS THE ALBUM? WELL, I COULDN'T SAY. YOU COULDN'T SAY? WELL, UNLESS... EVAN CARLTON. HOW WOULD HE GET IT? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW THAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET IT AWAY FROM TERRY. HOW? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE WENT TO SEE TERRY THE NIGHT HE... THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED? YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN. OKAY, WELL... OH, UM... PHOEBE SAYS TO SAY HI... AND SHE DIDN'T TRY TO KILL YOU. OKAY. OKAY. TELL HER I BELIEVE HER. I WILL. FEEL BETTER. [HOSPITAL P.A.]: DR. FORREST, PLEASE DIAL 118. NO, EVAN CARLTON WANTED TO STEAL PHOEBE AWAY FROM TERRY, BECAUSE TERRY STOLE EVAN'S WIFE AWAY FROM HIM. HE HATED TERRY. SO YOU THINK EVAN CARLTON KILLED TERRY YASBECK? TRY THIS ONE OUT FOR SIZE. EVAN GOES TO TERRY AND SAYS, "HEY, I'M GOING TO TAKE PHOEBE AWAY FROM YOU, AND NOT ONLY THAT, I'M GOING TO TAKE PHOEBE'S ALBUM AWAY FROM YOU." TERRY REFUSES, OF COURSE. THINGS ESCALATE, OLD TENSIONS BOIL OVER... BOOM, EVAN PULLS A GUN ON TERRY. YEAH, AS A D.A., I WOULDN'T PROSECUTE HIM. LET'S GO TALK TO HIM. MAYBE HE'LL CONFESS. SHOULD I BE GOOD COP OR BAD COP? LET'S BE LAWYERS. THAT'LL NEVER WORK. [MILES]: SO, THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, WE ESTABLISHED THAT TERRY YASBECK STOLE YOUR WIFE. THAT'S FAIR TO SAY? HE COULDN'T STEAL HER. I DIDN'T OWN LINDA, I WAS MARRIED TO HER, AND YEAH, SHE CHOSE TERRY OVER ME, AND I LET HER GO, END OF STORY. AND YOU DIDN'T RESENT THAT AT ALL? I'VE PUT THAT ALL BEHIND ME. YOU SEEM AWFULLY FORGIVING TOWARD TERRY YASBECK, I MEAN, COMPARED TO THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE WERE HERE. YEAH, YOU KNOW, I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT HIM THAT WAY SO SOON AFTER... AFTER YOU KILLED HIM? LOOK, I DIDN'T KILL TERRY, OKAY? BUT YOU HAD A REASON TO, RIGHT?. RIGHT, LOOK... I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED SHE TOLD YOU, SEEING AS HOW YOU ARE HER BROTHER. SHE IS MY SISTER, BUT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR IT COMING FROM YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER, AND WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW TERRY WAS TREATING HER, AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME... YEAH, I WAS ANGRY, VERY ANGRY. SO YOU WENT TO SEE HIM THAT NIGHT. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? I DIDN'T... UNTIL JUST NOW. YEAH, YEAH, OKAY, I WENT TO SEE HIM, BUT IT WAS JUST TO GET HER OUT OF THE CONTRACT. I WANTED TO GET HER ALBUM BACK, AND WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT. AND? AND THAT'S IT. HE WOULDN'T DO EITHER. HE JUST LAUGHED AT ME, SO I WENT HOME AND... YOU KNOW, I FIGURED I'D LET THE LAWYERS HANDLE IT. AND THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, MR. CARLTON. WHAT DO YOU WANT, HUH? DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT MY COMPUTER, SEE IF HER ALBUM'S THERE? WE DON'T HAVE A WARRANT. YOU DON'T NEED ONE. I'LL LOOK FOR YOU. HER ALBUM IS CALLED "JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF MY SOUL." ♪ BE MY RIDE OR DIE ♪ ♪ EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT ♪ ♪ NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOUR SIDE, LOVE ♪ WELL, WELL. WHAT'S THAT, MR. CARLTON? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S HER ALBUM. - HOW DID IT GET THERE? - I DON'T KNOW! - TERRY GIVE IT TO YOU? - NO. MAYBE YOU TOOK IT... THE NIGHT YOU KILLED HIM. ♪ I DON'T CARE IF THEY SAY SLOW DOWN, TOO YOUNG ♪ ♪ I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ♪ ♪ BE MY RIDE OR DIE ♪ SO EVAN HAS MY ALBUM? THAT'S AMAZING. DO YOU KNOW EVAN IS IN LOVE WITH YOU? YES. YES. ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM? YES. YES? WHY... WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT? I JUST, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT. OR WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WERE PROTECTING HIM? WAS IT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THAT GAVE HIM A MOTIVE? DO YOU THINK EVAN CARLTON KILLED TERRY? I... I THINK HE COULD HAVE... FOR ME. [COACH]: OKAY, FELLAS, THAT'S TWO-WAY! TWO-WAY, FELLAS! GOOD JOB! HE'S STILL NOT PLAYING HER. HE'S GOING TO PUT HER IN. HE'S JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME. HE'S ACTUALLY A VERY REASONABLE GUY. YOU LIKED HIM? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I JUST SAID THAT HE'S A REASONABLE GUY. YOU WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT HIM THAT WAY BEFORE YOU GUYS HAD COFFEE. WAIT A MINUTE... YOU LIKE-LIKE HIM. I DON'T LIKE-LIKE HIM. YES! NO, I JUST THINK THAT YOU AND I MAYBE, UM... YOU KNOW, WE JUST DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. OH, BOY, YOU REALLY LIKE HIM. YOU KNOW, I JUST... BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE HASN'T PUT HER IN YET. WELL, I DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE-LIKE HIM. IF HE DOESN'T PUT HER IN... I KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF YOUR MIND. DON'T THINK I WON'T! I'M SURE YOU WILL. [CLAIRE]: IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HASN'T PUT HER IN YET. HE PROMISED ME! GOOD TRY, BUDDY! GOOD TRY, HUEY! WE GOT SOMEONE ON THIRD, BOYS. WE GOT SOMEONE ON THIRD. HE'S NOT GOING TO PLAY HER. TO THINK THAT I LIKED THIS GUY! ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HE DOING? LOU! YOU'RE UP. HE'S ASKING HER TO PINCH HIT! IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. THAT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL, RIGHT? YEAH. [COACH CLAPPING] LET'S GO. COME ON. COME ON, LOU. I KNOW, I'M NERVOUS. [CROWD GASPING] NOT GOOD? NO. COME ON, BABY. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. BOO-YAH! [CROWD CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CLAIRE]: GO, LOU! [COACH]: BOO-YAH! WHOO! LOU! [CHEERING] GO, LOU! [CLAIRE]: GO, LOU! LOU! LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU! THAT'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER. YEAH! WHOO! [WHISTLING] [CLAIRE]: SEE, COACH? WOW, YOU HIT THAT BALL RIGHT DOWN THE CENTER, BAM! LOU, THAT WAS AWESOME. WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW TO HIT LIKE THAT? MY DAD AND I USED TO PRACTICE TOGETHER. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS JUST PRACTICED PITCHING? WELL, YEAH, BUT WE WORKED ON EVERYTHING. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD OF YOU. UH... EXCUSE ME, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING OUT THERE? WHAT? I LET YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER BE THE HERO. YOU WERE SETTING HER UP. YOU WANTED TO CUT HER FROM THE TEAM. YOU COULD CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT... OR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT I GAVE HER A CHANCE TO SINK OR SWIM, AND SHE SWAM. [JOANNA]: AND WHAT ABOUT NEXT WEEK? [COACH]: I'LL GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE. YOU'RE GOING TO LET HER PITCH? WE'LL SEE. YOU DON'T TREAT ANY OF THE OTHER KIDS LIKE THIS. NO, I DON'T. BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL. BECAUSE SHE'S SPECIAL... UNLIKE THE OTHER KIDS. OH, OH, SO... BECAUSE SHE'S SPECIAL, YOU TREAT HER WORSE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE? THAT'S RIGHT... 'CAUSE I WANT HER TO WORK FOR IT. RESISTANCE BUILDS STRENGTH, YOU KNOW. SO DO YOU WANT TO GET ANOTHER COFFEE SOMETIME? HMM... AH, WE'LL SEE. RESISTANCE BUILDS STRENGTH, YOU KNOW. SHE'S GOOD. ♪...EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT ♪ ♪ NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOUR SIDE ♪ ♪ NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOUR SIDE, LOVE ♪ SHE'S GREAT. - ISN'T SHE? - YEAH. ♪...NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOUR SIDE ♪ [TERRY]: HEY, PHOEBE? [PHOEBE]: YEAH? [TERRY]: PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU ASLEEP? [PHOEBE]: UH, UM, I'M SORRY. [TERRY]: TRY IT AGAIN! MR. WYLKES AND HIS GRANDDAUGHTER BELIEVE IN OBEYING THE LETTER OF THE LAW, AND HERE IS A LICENSE FOR THE PURVEYING OF LIQUID REFRESHMENT, SIGNED AND NOTARIZED. YOU'LL FIND THAT IT PERTAINS TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND ITS ENVIRONS. IT'S DATED TODAY. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT LAST WEEK WHEN THEY WERE OPERATING ILLEGALLY? [JOANNA LAUGHING] WELL, I THINK THAT WE CAN FORGIVE A FEW DAYS OF... I DON'T. I DON'T FORGIVE ANYBODY. I'M STILL GOING TO SUE THEM AND PROSECUTE THEM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. REALLY? YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS? I REALLY AM. ALL RIGHT, MRS. BELLAMY, UM... WHAT IF WE WERE TO LOOK INTO YOUR BUILDING VIOLATIONS? I DON'T HAVE ANY. HMM, THAT APARTMENT ABOVE YOUR GARAGE? IT HAS A BATHROOM, DOESN'T IT? IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD ZONED FOR THAT? AND WHAT ABOUT UNLAWFUL GARAGE CONVERSIONS? HMM? HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THOSE ZONING VIOLATIONS? OH, I DIDN'T, BUT COME ON, EVERYONE'S GOT ZONING VIOLATIONS, RIGHT? [LAUGHING] SEE? TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO DO IT. ♪ NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOUR-- ♪ - [TERRY]: HEY, PHOEBE? - [PHOEBE]: YEAH? [TERRY]: PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU ASLEEP? [PHOEBE]: UH, UM, I'M SORRY. [TERRY]: TRY IT AGAIN! CHESTER, GO THROUGH THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AGAIN. SEARCH EVERYTHING FROM THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. [PHOEBE]: I SWEAR, IF YOU DO THAT... YOU'LL BE SORRY. [TERRY]: OH, I'M TREMBLING. [PHONE RINGING] [CLEARING THROAT] IT'S THE WIFE. DO YOU MIND? HELLO. I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I JUST HEARD SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME. DON'T YOU HEAR IT? HEAR WHAT? WINNIE, GET ME THE TRANSCRIPT FROM LINDA YASBECK'S TESTIMONY. JUST A SEC. HERE IT IS. READ THE PART WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S MURDER, THE NIGHT OF THE CALL. WHEN HE WAS SHOT? UM, OKAY. "I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'." [TERRY]: I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'. OKAY, I... HEY, PHOEBE? PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU-- [GUN FIRING] [CRASHING] "HEY, PHOEBE?" "PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU..." AND THEN SHE HEARS THE GUN SHOT. EVERYTHING HE SAID WAS IN THIS RECORDING. SOMEBODY COULD HAVE EDITED THIS AND PLACED THE CALL. WHICH WOULD MEAN TERRY MIGHT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEAD BY 1:30. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN PHOEBE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING AT THE CLUB. SHE'D HAVE AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI. YOU'VE GOT TO PROVE IT. LOOK, IT'S THE TRUTH, RIGHT? DON'T KILL ME. I'M JUST THE MESSENGER. YOU EVER WONDER WHY THE MESSENGER HAS SO FEW FRIENDS? UGH. MRS. YASBECK, I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO DO THIS AGAIN, BUT DO YOU REMEMBER THE PHONE CALL YOU RECEIVED FROM YOUR HUSBAND ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION? [LINDA]: YES. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. DO YOU REMEMBER HIS EXACT WORDS? OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. I SEE NO REASON ON EARTH TO PUT MRS. YASBECK THROUGH THIS ORDEAL AGAIN. I'M INCLINED TO AGREE. IT DOES SEEM UNNECESSARY. IF THE COURT WOULD JUST INDULGE ME FOR ONE MORE MINUTE. I, FOR ONE, AM TIRED OF INDULGING MS. DARROW. YOUR HONOR... ENOUGH. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MRS. YASBECK? DO YOU OBJECT? NO. I REMEMBER HIS EXACT WORDS. HE SAID, "I'LL BE COMING HOME SOON, HON'." THOSE WERE HIS FIRST WORDS? [LINDA]: YES. HE DIDN'T SAY HELLO? NO, HE DIDN'T. DID HE USUALLY SAY HELLO? I GUESS USUALLY, YES, HE SAID HELLO. OKAY. AND THEN WHAT DID HE SAY NEXT? "HEY, PHOEBE." [CLAIRE]: WAS IT A QUESTION? PARDON? WAS IT LIKE, "HEY, PHOEBE," OR WAS IT LIKE, "HEY, PHOEBE?" I DON'T KNOW. OKAY, WHAT DID HE SAY NEXT? HE SAID, "PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU..." THANK YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE. DID IT SOUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS? CHESTER. [TERRY]: I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'. HEY, PHOEBE? PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU... YES, YES. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR! NON-DISCLOSURE. HOW DID MS. DARROW GET A COPY OF THAT PHONE CALL? I WAS WONDERING THE SAME THING, MS. DARROW. I DIDN'T. MY ASSOCIATE, CHESTER LIME, PIECED IT TOGETHER FROM BITS OF A CONVERSATION ON A STUDIO TAPE. SO THAT WASN'T THE CALL THAT MRS. YASBECK HEARD? ACTUALLY, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MRS. YASBECK HEARD BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE KILLER DID. I OBJECT AGAIN. ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TAKE MS. DARROW'S WORD FOR IT THAT THIS MAGICAL AUDIO TRICK IS POSSIBLE? OBJECTION SUSTAINED! THAT'S MY JOB, MS. DARROW. [CLAIRE]: I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAVE TIME, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO CALL AN EXPERT ON AUDIO ENGINEERING. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL JONAH LAROCHELLE. [MUTTERING] [CLAIRE]: MR. LAROCHELLE, IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION, COULD THE AUDIO HAVE BEEN ALTERED IN THE WAY DESCRIBED? I IMAGINE IT COULD. COULD YOU HAVE MADE THIS RECORDING YOURSELF? I THINK I COULD HAVE. DID YOU MAKE THIS RECORDING? I... NO! THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WELL, WHO WAS IN A BETTER POSITION TO MAKE IT? PHOEBE. SHE USED TO BE MY ASSISTANT. SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT AUDIO ENGINEERING, AND BESIDES, SHE TRIED TO KILL ME, REMEMBER? SHE HIT ME ON THE HEAD AND THEN TRIED TO ASPHYXIATE ME WITH MY OWN CAR. [CLAIRE]: OH, YES, THE CAR. YOU WERE VERY LUCKY... OR WERE YOU LUCKY? MAYBE YOU WERE JUST... CAREFUL. OBJECTION. [JUDGE]: I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT. I WANT TO SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING. DID YOU STAGE THAT ASSAULT ON YOURSELF, MR. LAROCHELLE? WHY ON EARTH WOULD I DO THAT? TO DIVERT SUSPICION FROM YOURSELF AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE PHOEBE STRASBERG TRIED TO KILL YOU. OBJECTION! WITHDRAWN. TELL ME, I WANT TO SEE IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS OBJECT WE'VE LABELED EXHIBIT C. SURE, IT'S A MIC STAND. WHICH MIC STAND? IT'S A MIC STAND. THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE. I DON'T THINK SO. THIS MIC STAND WAS FOUND IN THE DUMPSTER OF A CHINESE RESTAURANT THREE BLOCKS FROM TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO. DO YOU SEE THE RED CLIP? WHAT? OH, YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE PHOEBE'S MIC STAND, THE ONE THAT SHE ALWAYS LIKED. [CLAIRE]: YOU ARE CORRECT. IN FACT, WE ARE PREPARED TO PROVE THAT THAT IS PHOEBE'S MIC STAND, AND WE ARE ALSO PREPARED TO PROVE THAT THE INSIDE TUBE OF THAT MIC STAND AND THE RED CLIP ARE BOTH COATED WITH BRAKE FLUID-- BRAKE FLUID FROM A CAR... NOT UNLIKE YOURS, MR. LAROCHELLE. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS BRAKE FLUID AND THE BRAKE FLUID IN MR. LAROCHELLE'S CAR... [CLAIRE]: HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE CORRECT, MRS. ASHLAND, AND I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE PROVEN... BUT IT IS INTERESTING, DON'T YOU THINK? NOT REALLY. BECAUSE SOMEBODY KNEW THAT THE STATE WOULD GIVE PHOEBE STRASBERG A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST AFTER TERRY YASBECK WAS KILLED, AND THAT PERSON KNEW THAT BRAKE FLUID COULD CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE ON THE TEST. I MEAN, YOU CAN FIND THAT OUT ON THE INTERNET... AND THAT PERSON DID THAT BECAUSE THAT PERSON KILLED TERRY YASBECK AND TRIED TO FRAME PHOEBE STRASBERG FOR THE CRIME. WELL, IT WASN'T ME. I WAS WITH PHOEBE AT THE NIGHTCLUB WHEN TERRY WAS KILLED. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TERRY WAS KILLED? I DON'T. YOU'RE CONFUSING ME. DO I HAVE TO ANSWER? YOU KIND OF DO. UH, COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION? WITHDRAWN. I'D LIKE TO PLAY THAT TAPE FOR YOU AGAIN. OBJECTION. [CLAIRE]: MR. LAROCHELLE IS AN EXPERT. I WOULD LIKE HIS OPINION ON IT. OVERRULED. PROCEED, MS. DARROW. [CLAIRE]: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. CHESTER? READY. [TERRY]: I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'. HEY, PHOEBE? PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU-- WELL? LIKE SHE SAID, I'VE ALREADY HEARD IT. OH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T. THAT IS A DIFFERENT RECORDING. THAT IS A RECORDING THAT MY ASSOCIATE, CHESTER LIME, WHO IS VERY THOROUGH, FOUND ON TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO COMPUTER SYSTEM. WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT WAS REALLY HARD TO FIND. HE HAD TO SEARCH THROUGH ALL THESE DELETED FILES AND RECONSTRUCT IT. I DID. WE BELIEVE YOU, MR. LIME. [CLAIRE]: BUT IN THE END, HE FOUND IT, BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE LIKE ELEPHANTS... THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING... AND YOU KNOW WHOSE FILE IT WAS DELETED FROM? NO. IT WAS YOURS. WHY'D YOU MAKE THAT RECORDING? IT WAS A JOKE. WAS IT? I'M NOT LAUGHING, MR. LAROCHELLE. YOUR WIFE IS PHOEBE'S BACKUP SINGER, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? [JONAH]: YES. ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOUR WIFE SENT TERRY YASBECK AN EMAIL THE WEEK OF THE MURDER? AN EMAIL? WITH AN ATTACHMENT. I, I, I... I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING. SHE SENT HIM AN E-MAIL OF HER SINGING. IT WAS ONE OF PHOEBE'S SONGS. WHY DID SHE DO THAT? I THINK HE REQUESTED IT. HMM, WELL... HER E-MAIL READS AS FOLLOWS... "I THINK I SING THIS SONG MUCH BETTER THAN THAT NO-TALENT PHOEBE." [LAUGHING] SHE WAS JOKING. WAS SHE? HERE'S TERRY'S REPLY. "PATHETIC. STICK TO BEING A BACK-UP SINGER. YOU CAN JUST BARELY DO THAT." HE WAS JOKING. HILARIOUS. HOW DID YOUR WIFE REACT? SHE LAUGHED, YOU KNOW. TELL ME, WHY WASN'T YOUR WIFE AT THE CLUB THE NIGHT TERRY WAS MURDERED? SHE WAS AT HOME. SHE WASN'T. WE HAVE SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM THE GAS STATION AT YOUR CORNER. IT SHOWS NORAH LAROCHELLE GETTING GAS AT 12:10 A.M., THAT EVENING. NOW, WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT UNLESS SHE WAS COMING HOME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE? UNLESS SHE WENT OUT JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT TO FILL THE TANK? THAT. SHE DID THAT. OR WAS SHE COMING BACK FROM TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO? SHE WASN'T. YOUR WIFE RESENTED PHOEBE'S SUCCESS, DIDN'T SHE? SHE HATED BEING A BACK-UP SINGER JUST A FEW FEET FROM STARDOM. SHE THOUGHT, WITH PHOEBE OUT OF THE WAY, EVAN CARLTON WOULD MAKE HER A BIG STAR. DIDN'T SHE? IS THAT WHY SHE KILLED TERRY YASBECK? OBJECTION! NO, SHE DIDN'T! I DID. I SHOT HIM. IT'S A TRICK, YOU IDIOT! SHUT UP! ORDER! [JONAH]: SHE KNOWS! SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING! I KNOW WHAT, JONAH? THAT YOUR WIFE KILLED TERRY YASBECK, AND YOU HELPED HER? YES. NO! I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF. [NORAH]: NO, HE DIDN'T. I DID IT. HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL AFTERWARDS. [COURTROOM CHATTING] YOUR HONOR, CAN WE TALK? - YAY, CLAIRE! - CHEERS! THANK YOU. WELL, I DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN. I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T. THANK YOU. YOU'RE SO WELCOME. YOU'RE THE BEST. SO, USING A RECORDING TO TIME-SHIFT THE MURDER, SMEARING THE MIC STAND WITH BRAKE FLUID... WHAT WOULD OCCAM THINK OF THAT? I'D SAY... HE'D PROBABLY THINK IT WAS PRETTY COMPLICATED, BUT HE DID LIVE IN THE 14TH CENTURY. MURDER WAS SIMPLER BACK THEN. CLAIRE? THANK YOU SO MUCH. - THANK YOU. - OH, OF COURSE. YOU ARE A MIRACLE WORKER. I'M NOT. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU SUSPECTED ME FOR A MINUTE. YEAH, I TOTALLY DID, AND YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW JONAH GOT PHOEBE'S ALBUM ON YOUR COMPUTER, BUT THAT WAS BRILLIANT. WHAT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT IN THE GARAGE? STAGED TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM JONAH. NORAH HIT HIM ON THE HEAD AND STARTED THE CAR. OH, SWEET COUPLE. AREN'T THEY? HEY, WHERE'D YOUR BROTHER GO? UM, HE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE. I'M NOT SURE. OKAY. THANK YOU! [CLAIRE]: MOM? GOOD JOB SETTLING THAT LEMONADE CASE. YEAH, I CALL IT THE WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS AFFAIR. YEAH, OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. WELL, ACTUALLY, MAYBE I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT. OKAY... AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO COURT. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO RESOLVE THINGS. I'M PROUD OF YOU, AND... I'VE BEEN THINKING, AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES, AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGES AHEAD, BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO OFFER YOU... TO OFFER ME MORE CASES? YEAH, I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU SOME MORE CASES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME A PARTNER? ASSOCIATE. WHAT IS WITH THE PARTNER? OKAY, I CAN WAIT... BUT NOT TOO LONG. HUG. AW. AW, THANKS. OKAY. [LOUDLY CLEARING THROAT] OH, AND... GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY, GREAT. GREAT. GREAT WORK. AH... HOMAGE. TO THE VICTOR GOES THE COFFEE. THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - WHERE'S YOURS? WELL... YOU HAVE TO BUY ME ONE BECAUSE YOU WON, BUT I WON, TOO. WE BOTH WON, DIDN'T WE? ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, YOU KNOW... YOU HAD FAITH, AND I DIDN'T, NOT SO MUCH. YOU ALWAYS BELIEVED SHE WAS INNOCENT. YEAH, NO, I DIDN'T THINK MY SISTER WAS A MURDERER. SO HOW COULD WE LOSE? YOU'RE... YOU'RE AMAZING. SEE, I'M A D.A. I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD START. MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. MAYBE I SHOULD START. YOU'RE RIGHT. SO, DINNER, SATURDAY NIGHT? YEAH, LET'S DO IT, BUT NO SHOP TALK, RIGHT? - NO SHOP TALK... - OKAY. FOR TEN MINUTES, AND THEN MAYBE SOME SHOP TALK. TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE GRAPE SODA. YOU HAVE GRAPE SODA. I HAVE GRAPE SODA. WELL DONE, COUNSELOR. LET'S CELEBRATE, COUNSELOR. YOU READY, MOM? YES, JUST A SEC. WELL, COME ON, LET'S GO! YOUR DAUGHTER'S ABOUT TO PITCH A PERFECT GAME. DON'T JINX ME! COACH SAYS HE'S GOING TO LET ME PITCH FOR A FEW INNINGS, YOU KNOW, JUST SEE HOW I DO. THAT IS GREAT. YOU'RE GOING TO GET NOTHING BUT STRIKE-OUTS. MOM, DON'T YOU JINX ME, TOO! SORRY, HONEY. WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO SAY? JUST QUIET CONFIDENCE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS. [JOANNA]: OKAY, HOW ABOUT... YOU ARE GOING TO BE PERFECTLY ADEQUATE! THAT'S BETTER. GO ADEQUATE! HEY, WE NEVER HAD OUR WEEKLY MEETING THIS WEEK. OH, I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT THIS WEEK. ME FIRST. UGH. MY PLAN IS TO PITCH WELL IN TODAY'S GAME. MY GOAL IS TO WRITE A GOOD PAPER FOR MY SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS, AND MY ASPIRATION... WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME TRYING OUT FOR THE VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM? YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? I'M KIDDING. SHE GETS THIS FROM YOU. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD. [♪♪♪]
