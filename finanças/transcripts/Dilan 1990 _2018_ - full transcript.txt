Ya. - Can I predict? - Ramal? Yes. I predict this afternoon we will meet in the canteen. - Want to come along? - No, thank you. But one day you will definitely ride my bike. Trust me. I'll leave first. ♪ How are you ... ♪ [happy conversation] You know what? This morning I was foretold by a child on a motorcycle. Guess what? He said he would meet him in the cafeteria. - Who? - Do not know her. So, to the cafeteria no? Not. Lia, it doesn't feel like you've been in school for two weeks . [chuckles] Yes. Lia, I want to offer to be class secretary. - Secretary? - Class leader. Yes, I know, but why me? Already, want it. Want some? Yes, it is okay. [male] Excuse me. - Milea, ya? - Ya. - There is a letter. - Letters? From my friend. - Where's Wati? - Already to the canteen. Yes. I'll leave first. He is Piyan Physics 1 grader. - You know? - Not.

Girlfriend! Halo? [Milea] That day I was very busy. Wash shoes ... chatting by phone with my boyfriend in Jakarta. In fact, what I want to do is smile to myself ... contemplated a magical invitation from the fortune teller. [man] Rest in place, move! Announcement for children who have not paid tuition fees in September please pay it off immediately. [man] Come on! Up! The clothes are put in. Come on The next announcement will be made by Mr. Suripto. Row, row. Neat clothes. - He again. - Who is he? Wedding. The flag ceremony is our way of giving thanks to the fallen heroes. This country needs disciplined students . [Milea] That morning I finally found out, the name of the Astrologer was Dilan. ... this nation. Ceremony, not even entered. [Milea] Said Rani, Dilan Grade 2 Physics 1 child. [dramatic music] Famous motorcycle gang member in Bandung. His position in the motorcycle gang is quite scary.

Who wants to go to BP's room to meet Mr. Suripto? - Who? - Only me! Oh. Sorry if I bothered you. That's your public transportation. I was just delivering. I was afraid that someone would be bothered. Ya. [denting piano] Left! [tells a story] After he left, I felt strangely guilty about being rude. He must be upset. Basically he is quite fun compared to Beni, my boyfriend in Jakarta who is monotonous which when giving poetry, plagiarized from the book Khalil Gibran or teen magazine. Strange. Why should I compare the Fortuneteller to Beni? [Nandan] That's Ridwan, beside him Hanafi. Well, if this one is Jenar, then it's Revi. Lia, there is a letter. Letter from whom? Who's sitting here, who? Already, later will continue to want the bell. Oh, nevermind. [Dilan] Notice! "Since yesterday afternoon, I've loved you." [soft music] - What letter, Lia? - Not. It is okay. - You're hungry, Ran? - Want to be treated Nandan. Is our canteen only this one?

Insyaallah. Piyan! [soft music] [Milea] I can read it from Nandan's eyes. He was disturbed by Dilan's words. I'm no expert in reading body language. But said Rani, he was assessing me. But many women like him. He is quite handsome and good at playing basketball. [bell rings] Dilan, what are you doing? [gasps] - Rani, can you sit down? - What? Sit down? May I have a paper? Borrow?

Yes, me. - I'm Dilan. - What? Hai. Milea, I went to your house earlier. Yes. You disguised yourself as a canteen messenger. Because you like to eat. [laugh] - Do you know why I came? - Why? If I didn't come because I was afraid of your father that means I'm a loser. So I came. But if your dad scolded, that's good. - Why is it good? - You will be sorry for me later. Did you get angry? No, but your father said you were sleeping, why now can chat? - Are you delirious? - [chuckle] - Where? - Who? - you. - Who are you? Wedding. [soft music] I am in... I'm on Mars.

Ya. [Milea] I actually like being able to go to Jakarta. But I was disappointed because Dilan did not participate. I called Beni last night, but not because I wanted to meet him. I'm just afraid that if you don't go to Jakarta , Beni will be angry. [Milea] We are disappointed, in Jakarta, the Intelligent Quiz team must return home. I went to the toilet first, while looking for Wati. Okay. - Ran. - Wait, wait a minute. Lia, why are you silent just now? It is okay. - Milea. - Beni. Wanted apparently here. Yesterday on the phone you said you couldn't come. So if I'm here now why? You don't like it when I come? - Just the two of you? - Not much. But everyone else was told to ... What are you doing?

You can judge for yourself the man who could scold his girlfriend in public. Wedding. Why isn't Dilan coming? Why? [Milea] Beni's voice saying "whore" kept ringing in my ear. In reply to the voice Dilan had said [Dilan] "Don't ever tell me someone hurt you. Later that person will disappear. " [melancholy music continues] [Ms. Milea] Lia. Lia. Wake up, kid. There are your school friends coming. - Come on? - Yes ma'am.

That's right. - There is a telephone. - Who else, Bi? - Dilan. - What? Yours sincerely? Friends, I'll pick up the phone first. Halo? - [Dilan on the phone] Are you sick? - Yes, but that's okay. - Why? - What's wrong? - Why sick? - No, the doctor said just tired. I should have eaten with you and been visited by that person. Wedding. I'm sorry yesterday did not come. Don't regret it. Yes, where are you? A handful. Here, Dilan. Ada Wati. - What is wrong with him? - visiting me. With other friends.

One day, you - Is that a prediction? - That's an offer. I have. - Come on, Neng. - Be careful, Bi. [sad music] [male] Events in Jakarta, that was a normal event. And Beni is also a normal human being, not to be mistaken. So, it is true what Bang Haji Rhoma Irama said. "Young blood, the blood of teenagers who don't want to feel wrong and don't want to budge. " [laugh] Beni also pleaded guilty. So, Lia also wants to forgive Beni, right? And Beni has promised never to do that again. Can I think about it first? Why think about it? Why not settle it now? Ben, be patient. This Lia needs time to think. [mother mumbles] - Mom. - Hi, Li. Why? There was Dilan, ma'am, here. Why? He came again, gave TTS? No, ma'am. He brought a masseuse then I got a massage then he went home. What do you mean, he brought in a masseuse. you get a massage, then he comes home? - Yup. - Very funny, Dilan. I'm curious, what kind of Dilan, Li? If you are young, don't you like someone like him? Hmm... - Maybe. - Why is that possible? Yes maybe Li, because if he is jealous for example, likes to be angry I'm sure you don't like it. [soft music] [phone rings] Halo? [Dilan on the phone] Lia, I'm resting. Cape. - What are you doing? - Learn. [Milea laughs] - Why are you laughing? - It's okay, why is that? I'm glad to hear your laugh. [laugh] - You have eaten? - Have you eaten yet? - [Sundanese] Wait a minute. Ma'am, excuse me. - Who are you talking to? [Indonesian] Here, it's the mother who is in the line. Ma'am, want to get to know Milea? - Not he said. Arrogant. - Say, sorry later. Ma'am, sorry later. This beautiful, ma'am. All the phone numbers, huh? Do not. Don't, ma'am. - Why? - The mother will love later. Ma'am, but I'm feeling sad. Lia has been absent for three days. - Tomorrow go to school, say. - To whom? To you! [laugh] - Lia, it was done before. - Yup. Don't forget what. - Don't forget what? - Memory. [laugh] - Kiss away or not? - Um ... You can. - Don't. - Why? Don't kiss far, later close. [happy music] Yes, done. Good luck learning more, Dilan. Okay, bye. [phone rings] Hello? - [Beni on the phone] How is it, honey? - It's not a pity! - Yes, Lia. I'm not Lia. - Then who? - Whore. Lia, I'm sorry. I plead wrong. - No need to discuss anymore. - It's forgiven. - So, are we still dating? - Not. Lia, I am nothing without you. I no longer want with you. Please, Lia.

You're already dating - Who is he? - The ones on TVRI. - No. - Then who? - You don't need to know who he is. All you need to know now, we broke up. Devil! Basic...

[shouting excitedly] - What does it mean? Come on [laugh] ♪ Listen to my silence ♪ ♪ And miss ... ♪ [Milea] That is the love story with Dilan when he lived in Bandung years ago. And tonight at my place, is a quiet night in Jakarta. Longing, the longing of the individual on my chest inside me is a sea of ​​longing. It is a river that keeps flowing, it is a sea that continues to float. No force can resist. So powerful as life, and active. [thunder booms] On Buahbatu Street, I felt I was at the top of the world. With Dilan, who taught me a lesson that true love is comfort. Trust, and also support. If you don't agree, I don't care. That's Dilan. My step. Mine. And already. I'm not asking for anything more. [the song "You're the Expert to Me" by Pidi Baiq continues]
