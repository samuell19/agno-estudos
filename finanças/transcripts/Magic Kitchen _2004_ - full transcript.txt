Who will be the King Chef? We'll soon find out. I can't handle this kind of contest. Don't jump to conclusions yet. If piracy existed in culinary arts, I'd be your ultimate bootleg chef. I'm the owner chef of a private kitchen. Ho is my assistant. Our business has been booming. Here come the crabs. Enjoy. But I don't really care for cooking. I've been copying my mother's recipes. She was the genuine culinary master. Unfortunately, nobody knew about that. Beef Noodle. Soy Sauce Noodle. She apprenticed in a big hotel's kitchen. Took her ten years to become a "frier". Sweet and Sour Pork. Ming, you cook it. Sexual discrimination limited her career. She never got a promotion. As a kid, I had two big questions. First, there were only two of us at home. Why did mom always cook so many dishes? Yam. This meal is for Elvis' memorial. At 2:00 am Hong Kong time today, US President Ronald Reagan, having survived an assassination attempt, is in a stable condition after surgery. The White House denies the need for Vice President to take over his duties. Who should we thank for this meal, Yau? President Reagan. As a kid, having good food sure was fun. But seeing mom weep in private, out of exhaustion from cooking, I felt very guilty. Soon, I began to reject her cooking. And became anorexic in the end. UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ...met with Deng Xiaoping this morning, to discuss the handover of Hong Kong. She tripped outside the Great Hall of the People when she left the meeting. Hurray. Time for grocery shopping. Oh my God. Our family recipes have a new volume. Why did dad run away before I was born'? Will he be back'? That was the second big question I had. The fact that your father dumped us was because of the curse. Yes. Our family curse. Your name is Yau Murong. Murong is your mother's family name. We were a prestigious family in Southern China. Ju Murong, your granny's granny, excelled in literary and martial arts. She was the crown jewel of the family. Mom said that Ju was a spoiled brat. Auyoung was a master chef in town. He was deeply in love with Ju. Ju told Auyoung that she would marry him if he passed over his cooking skills. Using the Galactic Rotation Stance, Ju sucked away Auyoung's culinary talents. Auyoung lost his cooking skills for good. Ju's righteous father was furious. He kicked Ju out of the family. He even hired a shaman to cast a spell. So that Ju and her female offsprings would all become chefs, to pass on the Auyoungs' culinary arts. Meanwhile, they would all be dumped by men until the karma came full circle. Your dad dumped me before your birth. This is your dad. My dad should look like Chow Yun-fat. Not an ordinary old man. I didn't ask about dad again. My anorexia continued. Then one day, mom cooked a simple meal. It was the best meal of my life. It was blissful and joyous. Who were there at the table'? I can't remember a thing. I studied fashion design. Worked as a buyer in a department store. Then the economic bubble busted. I hopped from one bad job to another. Morn opened her restaurant 3 years ago. But she passed away 6 months later. I managed to take over. Thanks to mom's secret cookbooks. But it seems that I'm destined to be a chef. Thank you for the hard work. So that's what the show is like. Let me show your way out. Sure. Please thank Mr. Murata for inviting us. As for the contest, I have to think about it first. I shall wait for your good news. He says he'll wait for your good news. Good. So long. Goodbye. The show's famous. Even in the US. You have to accept the invitation. They announce the ingredients live. No time to flip through the cookbooks. I'd be caught totally off guard! You can't depend on your mom's books for the rest of your life. It's time you found your own style and became a genuine chef. The show'd be the perfect opportunity. Nah, our business is good. No need to complicate things. Stop it. Gotta pretend I don't speak Japanese. But you really don't speak Japanese. Chun Yao? Yam. No wonder. What do you mean by that'? You hit me from behind. Mine's a rental car. How're you gonna compensate? Compensate'? Yeah. I'll pay right now if you dare to ask. - It's okay. - Yes. Just a scratch. Insurance will cover. A friend? Sorry. Chun Yao. Ho. - Nice to meet you. - How's it going? Do you have time for coffee'? Gotta take some friends to the airport. I'll be busy tonight. If the mechanic needs anything, call me. - Okay. - I stay at Shimbashi. Century Hotel, Room 2301. Call me anytime. Anytime. Okay. Your ex'? How do you know'? It's all written on your face. About time. Thought you'd stood us up. Where's Ho? Cruising the town on his own. The flight is 6:30. Still have time for coffee. Blue Mountain, please. You and Ho will go to onsen tomorrow. Things will happen when you're naked. Just keep in mind, your ass droops a bit these days. Turn off the light before you undress. Shut up. I'm not horny like you. He's been working for me for 3 years now. Never got a raise or bonus. The trip's an incentive. Thought you were here to keep me company. Turned out to be a shopping trip for you! Of course. Show me what you got. Kwai works in a talent management firm. But dating is her true profession. Even back in kindergarten, she was already full of potential. There was this boy in our class who had a very bad habit. He'd take out his thingy and parade it around. Quarry Bay. But it didn't bother Kwai at all. She told the boy, "I'm bored. Show me your thingy." And they got caught. Both got detention. Thought I'd go sweep the outlets. But May said it's too far away. Too classy for her. She didn't want to go. May's a successful publicist. Somone way too elegant to visit outlets. Three years ago at the Mid-Autumn Festival, some friends came to my restaurant for crabs. Kwai brought May over and introduced us. Wait. Let's eat first, shall we'? Alright, alright. I first learned about... ...the sensuality of food that night. If you ever want to have a food orgy, I suggest having crabs with a bunch of friends. With a crab in hand, a bond was established between you and the crab. A private universe emerged. But May really stood out. Full of elegance and sensuality. It wouldn't be bad to be that crab. Touched by her lips and fingers. Then ended up deep inside her. That's worth dying for. How many did you have? Five times. I mean five. And you? Two. When it hits the spot, one's plenty. Do you mind'? I worship May ever since that night. A slight change of plan tonight. You're a man. You ought to hang out in Kabukicho. Let me introduce. This is Mr. Yoshida. He speaks English. Nice to meet you. I'm Ho. Nice to meet you. But you promised me to go shabu-shabu. You don't wanna hang out with your boss. Mr. Yoshida knows Kabukicho very well. He says it's safe. Don't worry. I have to meet somebody. Go have fun. See ya. Yes, I did have to meet somebody. Only that somebody didn't know about it. I wanted to hang around Chun Yao's hotel. See if I could bump into him. Why does he live here? But the place is too convoluted. Chance of bumping into him is slim. No, no message for Mr. Chun Yao. Oh... sorry. Can I ask, his room. Is it a single room or a double room? Sorry, madam, we cannot give out such information. Oh, Ok. Oh. Thanks, bye. So I made a sensible decision. I went for a movie nearby. Maybe after the show I could bump into him on his way back. Wait. Please wait. I'm sorry, I'm not going. After a Japanese flick with no subtitles, I finally felt like a moron. Only Chun Yao has the power to transform me into a moron. This ex-boyfriend from five years ago. There are CDs for sale. I've already bought it for you. Each will get one. Thank you. Back so soon? Chickened out? I could take care of myself. If you had other plans, all you had to do was to tell me. My bad. I treated you like a horny boy. You're a man of principles. A horny boy who can take care of himself. Don't twist my words around. Just kidding. Did you eat? Let's go back to the hotel. They have great shabu-shabu on the top floor. My treat, okay'? I don't feel like shabu-shabu now. You didn't eat a thing'? What kind of date was that'? Sake. You have sake? - Sake'? - Yes. I don't sell alcohol. No alcohol served. I really embarrassed myself today. No big deal. I didn't blame you. I'm not talking about you, dummy. You're so pretty. I can't help it. This is my private sake. My treat. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yours. Cheers. In the end, I finished the whole bottle. One less drunk ramen stall owner in Tokyo tonight. But one more babbling drunk woman. Chun Yao was my tutor at junior high. He was also my first love. Of course, he wasn't aware of that. Then I met him again six years ago. Hi. Tutor? We're colleagues now. Don't call me Tutor. I work at the sports section. 6th floor. Purchasing department, right'? I saw you yesterday. But you didn't see me. Gotta find some topics. Ask him how he has been. Ask. It's been a long time. How's your sex life? Not bad, not bad. Do you recall my love letter'? When? The day before you quit the tutoring gig. I put the letter in your backpack. No, I didn't see it. Wasn't that letter the reason YOU quit the job? No. I joined the Hong Kong Sports Team. Had to go training. What did the letter say'? It's not too late to tell me now. What'? You went to stalk Chun Yao after seeing us off at the airport'? How lame. It's been five years. Yet you still haven't recovered. Where's the gal who declared that the relationship was hopeless? You suck. Yes, I did say that. And I meant it. We were colleagues and we fell in love. It happened all so fast. At least I felt that way. Chun Yao was a perfect gentleman. But I was the aggressive one. One weekend, I suggested camping. Your mind's in the gutter. But we were hit by the storm of the century, and had to be rescued... ...by firemen even before the foreplay. Two weeks later, at Chun Yao's place. Turn off the light first. Fire. C'mon, still time for a quickie. Time to run for our lives. We went to Macau for a change of luck. Nothing could go wrong, right'? It's okay. We're in a rush. I checked. The pipes are working. The A/C is functioning. The smoke detector's been wet-wrapped. Nothing can stop us tonight. Wait. The springs are sturdy, too. You prefer DF or SF'? What'? What does that mean? Dinner first or sex first? PPF. What's PPF'? Po Po (hug) First. Wait. What's wrong? SN“: What SM? Suo Mun (lock the door) First! Okay. Quick. Lock the door. Let's go together. I'm truly sorry. It's a network error. We're fully booked tonight. But our staff is searching for availabilities in other hotels. So who's moving out then? Not us. We booked the room first. We'll move. No way. It's a matter of principle. But we did book the room first. After two hours of arguments, we won and didn't have to move. Yet the mood was totally ruined. One time could be an accident. But over and over again, that's fate. I couldn't help but think about the curse. Is it for real'? We checked out and went back to Hong Kong. Later, we did one more try at my place. It was more out of desperation. No suicide. No arsen. No endangered buildings. Chun Yao ended up with a broken arm. In order to make for the Hong Kong Bowling Team, he quitted the job and went to the US for treatment. After that he headed for team training. Soon we barely saw each other any more. Until this time in Tokyo. Strictly speaking, we never broke up officially. Hello Awesome. Ho's making a Pepsi cake. All you think about is food. Don't you want to be in shape for the Miss Hong Kong pageant? No way the whole market's out of chicken. Wing's stall is closed. How about Kau's'? Don't they have chicken? You said Kau's chickens were never fresh. And their weight's not accurate. What's wrong? Come with me. I soaked the sea urchins for two days. I planned to cook them with duck sauce. The second dish should be roast chicken. But this Ho. He didn't buy a single chicken. And he bought ducks instead. The first dish uses duck sauce. How can the second dish be duck again'? Tell me what to do. Come on. The sea urchins can wait. You can cook them tomorrow. Serve your famous roast duck tonight. Delicious. Why do you keep provoking her'? You know she's been out of it after the Japan trip. Why do you keep solving her problems? Let her figure things out herself. Train her reflexes. Train her for the King Chef Contest. You're for real'? Of course. I thought you were only joking. In order to train her, you'll continue to buy wrong ingredients on purpose? Yes. Ever since the Japan trip, I've been indeed out of it. Lots of feelings stirred inside of me. I have a habit. I iron when I'm moody. No way. Kwai dragged me out of the apartment. She took me to a bar run by firemen. That sounded intriguing. Kwai. Hi, Don. Let me introduce. Don's a firehouse captain. This is Yau. Hi. A friend of yours is already here. Where'? Over there. Seems to be having fun. Excuse me. Enjoy. Thought you didn't want to come. Wanted to see if it's up to the level. And'? What do you think? It's a keeper. Told you it's hunk central. Attention, ladies. Twelve o'clock. We've got eye candy. Handsome. But a bit too young. I have a new boyfriend now. You know, the honeymoon period. Want to be together all the time. Coming from you, it's hardly news. You want real news, ask Yau here. She bumped into her ex in Tokyo. And she's been in the clouds for days. Look at her. So out of it. Wake her up, will ya? If you can't let go, don't. So what? For love... You have every right to torture yourself. God have mercy. No wonder I worship her. Relationship's never a bilateral affair. It's a game of solitaire. I didn't quite get May's reasoning. Kwai flirted with Don for while. Then she went to see her new boyfriend Mook. The cute guy and I sat till closing time. Then we went our separate ways. A week later, May called me and reserved a table in my restaurant. Is it here'? Sure'? Go for it. He always shows up... ...at the worst time. Shit. Here you are. Good thing it's my day off. We have good news and bad news. The bad news. Guess you already know. The good news is that I'm here to pick up your remains all night long in case you fall into pieces. It was you. Chun Yao didn't think so. Come. Let's get reacquainted. Hi. May said you were the owner and chef here. I was in shock. What a coincidence. I didn't know he was your high school tutor. That's right. Did I tell you to cook chicken tonight? Friday's Kunpao Shrimp. Remember? Don't you remember'? You changed the menu yesterday for May. That's right. Sago & grapefruit in mango syrup. Try it first. My favorite. How do I look'? You fly, babe! Go. Go. Thanks. How's everything? Superb. They all say Yau has magic fingers. Even the most ordinary dishes turn sublime in her hands. Some even find her cooking blissful. They're just being nice. Incredible. Really. You didn't think I could cook? My mom was a chef. Remember'? I do. But it's been so long ago. Why don't you sit down? We have an ulterior motive tonight. Okay. My company just closed... ...a huge deal in China. May's in charge of organizing the contract-signing party for us. You're the first caterer that came to my mind. So I took him here for audition. But I haven't done parties for ages. I'm not taking no for an answer. Mr. Chun Yao here is our best sales rep. How do you do, Mr. Chun Yao'? Nice to meet you. You're in good hands. Trust me. Red wine's running out. Please check on it. Heard that'? Check on the wine. We have plenty. Sure? Yeah. Great. Here you are, Chun Yao. What's up? He just opened a new store in New York. What day will that be? Take over for a while. Sure. More wine, Miss? Okay. Thanks. This is not bad, but it's not suitable for this party. Yeah? Why is that'? Hot dogs are for baseball games. Popcorns are for movies. This wine's an overkill for this party. Cheaper stuff would've done. However, having it with you here is most appropriate. Not very original, are we'? Really? I have to work on it. Guess I'm still in business mode. I wholesale this wine. I'm also a part-time writer. You? I'm a Cantonese Opera singer. I love Cantonese Opera. Honestly? I love Fong Yimfun's "Snow in June" & "The Nymph of River Lo". What's your best tune? "Everybody Loves Kungfu Fighting". Cheers. I'm sure you don't know how to play. I do. Not like that. Watch. It's not checkers. I know. Let me rub it first. Gorgeous. Let's go. I'm watching the fireworks. I'll drive you for a closer look. Come. Watch out. Come on. I'll give you a ride. The percentile I studied in school turns out to work in real life. Should I hang out with this girl? Do I really want that dress'? 7O percent? Or 75? I'll buy it for 75 percent. I really want it. When I bumped into you in Tokyo, I asked myself. How badly did I want you'? The answer was: Very very much. But maths doesn't work here any more. One minute it's 100 percent. The next minute it's only 2O percent. The whole world's upside down. Short-circuited. I really don't know what to do. Ho'? How come it's you? Why shouldn't it be me? How come we're here? It's you who didn't want to go home. The party. What about the party'? Don't you remember'? Remember drinking with that cheeseball'? A little. Well, I asked Chun Yao to help. We carried you to the parking lot. Had you rested in the car. I wanted to drive you home after the party. But you wanted to go for a spin. I've been waiting for you to sober up. I left you running... ...the party alone? You can say that. People were satisfied with the service. I blew it. I totally blew it. What did I say'? What did I tell you'? Did I say something stupid'? You were teaching me percentile. Drive me home. Now. Yu's stall has acquired some geese. Should we buy some goose eggs'? Sure. It's your call. My Call'? Yes. I'm giving you a promotion. You can make your own calls now. Wait. Do you really trust me'? Or is it just to shut me up'? I won't tell anyone about last night. I really feel bad about it. Leaving you on your own like that. Besides, you've been with me for 3 years. It's time you took on some cooking... I take your words for it then. Does that mean I can read your cookbooks'? Those cookbooks are really personal. I can't show them to you. You have the recipes in your computer. But to cook the Murong family dishes, I need to know your family history. Or the dishes would be soul-less. Nonsense. You never put your soul into cooking. Have you thought about that? Yet every dish you cook tastes great. It's because of your morn. The notes and pics in her cookbooks. She left you her heart and spirit. You're exaggerating. Either way, I have to think about it. Can't answer you right now. Let's eat. The phone. Hello, May? No way. I did the cooking myself. The ingredients were all fresh. I cooked them fresh and delivered them right away. Please investigate carefully. What's wrong? It's May. She said a dozen guests got food poisoning and were hospitalized. Could our food have been contaminated'? Impossible. Coffee? No, thanks. How do you prove... ...that it's our food? It's just suspicion. Suspicion'? The Health Department is turning my place upside down. That really hurts my reputation. It's standard procedure. The hospital was obliged to report it. May has been to my place many times. She knows about my quality very well. She could've explained to the hospital. Or defended me against the Health Department. Did she do that'? Don't blame her. She was the party's organizer. It's a big headache for her, too. I had to explain to my boss also. Alright, so I'm the scapegoat. Are you satisfied? Who can I blame if I go out of business? With friends like you, I don't need enemies. Come on. Be fair, okay'? It's strictly business. Don't make it personal. I make it personal'? Yes. How do I make it personal'? You were the customers. I was just the server. So you're not happy about my service? Or you think I set you up? I didn't say anything like that. You're distorting the situation. If you believe in your innocence, why get so worked up then'? Mark my words, Chun Yao. It's got nothing to do with my food. Okay. Simmer down then. He's peeking over again. So cute. I'm getting turned on. You whore. You look so horny. Stay away from me. But he's not looking at me. He's checking you out. Nonsense. Really. You're nuts. Look. I asked her to come. She called you to apologize. But you weren't answering. You have every right to be mad at me. But please hear me out. Those guests were rushed into the ER, having diarrhea and vomiting. Some even needed IV. They're business partners from China. The language barrier didn't help, either. This morning they felt better. We found out that they'd had unsanitary seafood before the party. The Health Department confirmed it. You know me, Yau. I never make things personal. I wasn't targeting you in any way. I was a bit rash. And I took off halfway last night. Chun Yao said you didn't feel well. He said that'? Migraine. - Feeling better now'? - Much. Ho was quite something. - He was totally in control. - Oh yeah'? Now don't be mad any more. No hard feelings? None. Great. I suddenly realized that, if I were a man, I'd be in love with May. Happy? Ready for fun tonight'? So what teams are they'? On the left are the HKU alumni. On the right are the British alumni. To help you memorize, simply put, the right side is the "Iron Buns". What's that? Use your imagination. Look at Numbers 4 and 7. I give their buns 95. The rest has an average of 80. What about the left side? The "Iron Hammers". Why hammer? What're you laughing about'? Do you prefer inches or centimeters'? How disgusting. You tramp. What'? I meant how high they could volley. You filthy girl. Can't take you anywhere. Kwai told me you're into athletic men. So knock yourself out. Number 4 has a law degree from Cambridge. Works for a prestigious law firm. Number 8's an MBA from London U. Works at the Monetary Authority. What are we waiting for? I'm gonna go. How? You didn't drive here. Paul, Dick Dick No. 4. - Hi. - How are you? I'm Kevin. Number 7. Number 7. See you at the bay. Bay? Why? The Marina Club. I'll give you a ride. Excuse me. Where's May? May? She left. Left? Bye. Let's go. Fooling around wouldn't be a big deal. But having been set up like that didn't make me feel good. Also, seeing May flirt with another guy, should I feel bad for Chun Yao or should I be gleeful? I just wanted to go home. So I told Kevin the truth. Kevin, I'm married. So? Me, too. It took me a while to get out of it. Ho? You're at the restaurant'? I wanted to tell you, you can refuse to compete in the show. But I'll still try to convince you. That's my freedom. We'll see. I'll prepare the dishes for Kwai and May tomorrow. Having just been betrayed by friends, I suddenly realized this young man here is the most reliable person in my life. Your jazz bar's at Causeway Bay? Right behind Mitsukoshi. Live shows on Fridays. You're all welcome. Friday nights. Do you play any instrument? He blows harmonica like a pro. Teach me. Dirty minds. I mean the real thing. Time to pop the wok. We're out of wine, boss lady. Where're the... ...'82 Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin'? Time to hand them over. Coming. Let me finish this dish first. You think they have X.O. sauce'? - Let me go check. - Thanks. Need something? Nothing. Come out and join us after this. Okay? Okay. Go back out. It's a mess here. I'll be done soon. Sorry. How's everything? Great. Drink this bottle first. There's one more. What about the XO sauce'? Sorry, I forgot. Are the dishes too bland'? They're perfect. Men. It's never enough for them. It's like Chun Yao and his chili sauce. Just ignore them. I didn't know you like it spicy. A newly acquired habit. Okay. I'll go get it. Sit down and join us. I can't cook and eat at the same time. You guys enjoy, I'll make dessert. OK'? Enjoy. Try this. What's your problem'? They're here to apologize, I thought. Yet you have to serve them. Running around like a slave. That's some way to apologize. What're you talking about? They didn't even save you a glass. Hello. So late. Where's May'? She went with Kwai to Mack's bar. Are you guys ORGY? Fine. We're fine. I just want to apologize to you. I was way out of line. You lost quite some business. Sorry about that. I should be the one apologizing. I was drunk and irresponsible. Let's call it even. If he looks at me once more, I'll hug him. Want a drink? Can we be friends again'? Thank God he doesn't say he treats me like a sister. I wanted to contact you all these years. When I bumped into you in Japan, I wanted us to patch up our friendship. I waited for your call. But you didn't. I thought you didn't want to see me. Now I'm with May. We'll probably see each other often. I don't want us to feel awkward. That's why I'm here. Can I ask you a question'? Go ahead. Do you really really like May? I've dated enough girls in my time. This time is for real. Do you think she feels the same? Doesn't matter. It's been going well. Now he treats me as a friend, I feel obliged to be honest. I understand. Say it. Tell him May's a flirt. You two are perfect together. You're all grown up now. Here. It's late. I should go. I'll see you out. I'd love to have a sister like you. Still washing the dishes? I'm working on tomorrow's stuff. Why are you back'? I forgot the cookbooks. I didn't lock it. I locked it up for you. Don't worry. I didn't peek. That's not what I meant. Then why are you back so late? What're you doing? Making a cake'? But tomorrow's dessert is swallow's nest with crystal sugar. You caught me. You know better. You. You're making me a birthday cake'? Your friends were so rude today. You wouldn't want to spend your birthday with them tomorrow. I was going to take it home. And bring it back tomorrow. It's not a big deal. On my birthday, after work, Ho and I had a picnic outdoors. We finished the whole cake before work. Are you really dumb or just faking it? Ho has the biggest crush on you. I kinda figured it out. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. It's just so awkward. Remember, you'll never be sure till you make a move. True, he's three or four years younger. But it's the 21st Century, Miss Yau. Don't be such a square. Lighten up, will ya? I've gotta go to Mack's. I see. So this time's for real. Yes. Every morning, I always wonder, what new challenges will I face today? Everyone will find challenges in different things. But what fun can you get out of your boring daily routine? Have to go. Think about what I said. - Okay. - Bye. Hi. Everything okay? Care for another glass'? No, thanks. Okay. Enjoy- Hi. What's up? May I sit down? Be my guest. I'm Joseph. You? Names don't mean much. What would you like to drink? "Names don't mean much". Nice. How cheesy. I knew I've had enough drinks. Joseph was not cheesy at all. Polite and humorous. Young and knowledgeable. Well read. Yet no ego whatsoever. Certainly an endangered species in a place like this. What followed shocked even myself. Sorry. What's wrong? Did you already? No. But I have to stop. Why'? Is it me? No! You're... Striking? Yes. I've been attracted by you all along. I've been to that bar for a month. You're definitely the one. What are you talking about'? I wanted to prove something to myself. You're gay and you want to be straight? No. Not at all. I'm straight. I just wanted to confront my weakness. I'm a new theology student. I'll be an apprentice priest tomorrow. I just wanted to see if I was able to reject seduction of the flesh, and dedicate myself fully to the Lord. Now I know. I can absolutely do it. Thank you, Lord. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. Could you spare a minute'? I know this is out of nowhere. My name is Tony. I'm a screenwriter. My apartment is above your restaurant. I remember. I've seen you before. I can smell your cooking everyday. Smells delicious. It's even... seductive. I have an acute olfactory instinct. I can tell apart delicate fragrances. Your cooking's smell is multi-layered. You must be kidding. No, no. Believe it or not, some people have observant eyes. I have an observant nose. Like music. Music can sound very differently depending on the musician's mood. Am I making any sense? What kind of mood do you think I'm in'? Not a very good one. Sorry. I'm just being babbling. Don't mind me. In fact, I'm writing a screenplay about a guy with a sensitive nose. He smells his neighbor's cooking evryday. And he falls in love with the aroma. Though he's never met his neighbor, he feels they know each other well. I was planning on paying you a visit. And here we are. I want your help in my research. Would that be okay'? Come over when you have time then. Great. Thank you. Thank you for your time. - Sure. - Bye. Bye. Excuse me. What's your name? Yam. - Bye, Yau. - Bye. The world is full of surprises. Appearances are always deceiving. Should I take May's advice then? Should I take the initiative'? What's up? Calling me here this late. Pour two glasses of wine. You are now the first outsider who gets to read the Murong cookbooks. What do you think? That's quick. What do you mean'? I had lots of plans to impress you. Like What? Like telling you I hate your mean friends. And'? Telling you I never want to get off work. And'? And taking you to fun places. Good. I think our lead should own a private restaurant. And she has a female assistant. Maybe a male assistant would be better'? Have there been accidents with Ho? Like floods, bed collapsing and stuff? Don't you jinx it. - Thanks. - Bye. Your shoe laces. Let's place the salted fish on top. And skip all other spices. Maybe a little sugar. Watch out. It's hot. How is it? Beyond words. It's like an out-of-body experience. We did it. What should we have? I love you, Murong Yau! I love you, Yau. I love you, Yau. Your turn. Wait. It has to come out naturally. I... Okay. I'll wait. A few weeks later, things changed a bit. So? Taste good'? Haven't had burgers for a long time. Gotta have one more. It's good once in a while. I have it all the time by myself. You know, I don't get paid much. What do you mean by that'? I was just thinking, I'm casual on eating, too. I'm going karaoke tonight. Wanna come? But last time you dozed off. I was dead tired from work. All right. Let's go to the arcade now. Okay. Let's go. He even minded paying the bill. He lacks a sense of security. You haven't slept together, have you? You can tell'? You are not ready for it yet? I can't make the first move. Guys his age should all be horny dogs. I don't get him. What's Ho up to? Can't figure him out. Sorry. I'm just a writer. Not a psychologist. But you are a man. That's true. Is something bothering him? Maybe he finds you not sensitive enough'? I thought only girls are like that. You're wrong. You're not joining the King Chef for me, right? Of course not. I made up my mind. You'll help me, right? Of course. You sure are up early. I didn't go to sleep at all. You're copying me, Pay UP- Well, it doesn't work anyway. Have clothes that need ironing? I know. You had a fight with Mook? No big deal. Why don't you two come to Japan? You can make up and be my cheerleaders. Great! Let's ask May and Chun Yao, too. The more the merrier. Great. May agrees to go. Really? I had breakfast with Chun Yao. He said both of them will go to Japan. Wonderful. He asked me what I think of them. I said what you mean by that. It turns out he plans to propose to May. So soon? They haven't been together long. I know what you're thinking. They're both my friends. I couldn't talk ill of May to him. He likes her so much. What can I do'? Has it occurred to you? In fact you want Chun Yao to be hurt. I don't want to talk to you now. I said what I said, because I'm jealous of Chun Yao. Ho and I made love for the first time that night. Ho saw through me. I would enjoy seeing Chun Yao suffer. Ho came to apologize, because he didn't want to affect my morale. Tomorrow's show will be the same. Only it will be live. We'll have all kinds of ingredients ready for the Chinese cuisine. Please check everything. Is everything okay? Welcome. This way please. Where's Chun Yao'? Don't know. After we checked in at the hotel, someone called him and he went out. He didn't say who called. Hey. You're here, too'? You didn't know they were coming? Kwai didn't tell me. Where is she? She went out after we'd checked in. I'll order a beer. Hi, what's wrong? Are you ready? Let's order first. Let's set things straight first. Why are you so drunk'? Something's bothering you? Yeah? I don't know. Why don't you ask May? That won't be necessary. Yes, Mook and I did sleep together. We're all grown-ups here. We know the rules. It's no big deal. That's that. You said you could separate sex and love. I told you I couldn't be monogamous. I'm aware of that. But May's my friend. Friends or not, it would've bothered either way. That does it. Wait a second. This has nothing to do with faithfulness. Talk about being faithful, I'm always faithful to my wife. Your wife? You never told me you're married. You never asked. Sorry I spoiled your trip. I have nothing to say. Bye. If it's okay. Good thing I got my revenge. Chun Yao and I did it before we came over. Don't lie. Isn't this messy enough? I have nothing to say, either. See you. Sorry about the way things turned out. You're in my shoes. Right. Sorry. I have to go after Chun Yao. He needs someone right now. So does Kwai. Go ahead. But you should know. If you can't forget about the past, the future will never come. Go ahead. You may never come back. Don't be silly. Of course I'll be back. Maybe you're right. I was cynical about their relationship. Seeing the way things turned out, I feel responsible. I should've told him everything. Go ahead. Could you check on Kwai? Let's meet up where the band plays. OK? Okay. I was talking to May. I asked her if we could start over. You really like her that much? More than I expected. What did she say'? Know the tale of the scorpion and the frog? A scorpion comes to a river bank. It doesn't know how to swim. It sees a frog. So it asks, "Can you help me cross the river?" The frog says, "Of course not." "if I carry you, you'll sting me at the back." "I won't do that," the scorpion says. "That would kill us both." So the frog carries the scorpion across. Halfway, the scorpion stings the frog. When they are both sinking, the frog asks why. "It's my nature," answers the scorpion. She said she didn't want to hurt the frog. To her, relationship is not bilateral. It's a game of solitaire. She told me that once. But I don't understand. I do. I really do. You look for the right partner all over the world. Someone that fits your dream. But dream lover doesn't exist. So you end up being manipulative. Trying hard to change your partner. She said she's tired of all that. She believes in fate. She wants both of us to enjoy only the good times. Don't you think she's being selfish? Perhaps. But you know her well. She was good to you and to her friends. Remember that cheeseball at that party? May got you out of the jam. She was just here. Who's that? Someone we can't afford to piss off. Let me take care of it. Okay? Okay. May told me and Ho not to mention it to you if you didn't remember a thing. I suggested that maybe we shouldn't show up together in front of you. She thought you ought to deal with that. But this thing with Mook, I still think she's way too selfish. But it seems you've forgiven her. Do you know why we broke up? We never officially... ...broke up all this time. When I was in high school, I was a Valedictorian and elite sportsman. Running the student council and all. Everybody thought I was the king of the world. Even now. People think I'm a playboy. A womanizer. Perhaps May thought so, too'? She thought she found a match in you. Perhaps. But deep down I'm just a homely guy. All I really want is a woman who is independent with a sense of humor. Someone complimentary. You're asking a lot, homely man! Now I know why you dumped me. I don't possess any of those qualities. That's not true. You have changed. You're fabulous now. Absolutely! Please don't say that. It would still work on me. Sorry. I would be scared, too. What if more accidents happened? When did we get on the train'? When we're together, odd things happen. Blaming it on me? Who else can I blame it on? We've never chatted so openly before. Maybe we could really be friends again. I told him about my family curse. I told him that, it took a car crash to meet him again. I'm fine. Go wait for Yau. Tell her I'll apologize to her tomorrow. What are you up to? Don't worry about me. I know the town. See you. I think Ho is a great guy. Don't let this ruin your relationship. What time is it? Go back. Or he would take it wrong. My heart tells me to go. But my mind says otherwise. Or is it the other way around'? Out of all the people we know, I realize Ho is the one who's most dedicated to love. He wants 100 percent of me. And he's giving me 100% of himself. Can you? Can you give him 100 percent'? Maybe not. Watching you leave the restaurant, I knew I couldn't. You think he knows? He knows I can't let go of the past. What about the present'? Can you give him 100% now? I don't have an answer to that. I can't go back to him until I find it. I know it's unfair to him. But I can't lie to him. I can't tell him I love him 100 percent. He would see through me. She's nowhere to be found. Not even in her favorite cafes and noodle shops. What about Chun Yao? He helped me look before his flight. He wanted you to know that Yau would show up. Mr. Murata says we can't wait anymore. Please let us know, Mr. Ho. Is Ms. Yau going to make it'? Yau will show up. I guarantee it. Please wait a bit longer. Are you really that sure? Yes. She's a responsible person. Mr. Murata really can't wait anymore. Could Mr. Ho take Ms. Yau's place'? Here you are. Go change. Quick. Sorry, Ho. I don't think I can do it. My mind's a mess. Please take my place. No way. Don't let personal affairs affect your work. That's not the reason. I've lost my confidence. I thought hard about it. You're right. Anything without sincerity is soul-less. No more pretending. No more lying to you or myself. Please take my place. You're the genuine chef. You've read the cookbooks. You can do it. I never opened them. I told myself, before you fully open yourself up to me, I'm not reading the cookbooks. Please don't hide anymore. Let me introduce. This is your assigned assistant. He has done this show before. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Ho Auyoung? Remember me? I'm Keung. Remember back in the culinary school? Keung. What a surprise. It sure is. We have to run. See you later. Ho Auyoung? Your last name is Auyoung? Dad died early. So I've been under mom's last name. Our Murong women have to pay our debt to the Auyoungs to lift the curse. Our master chef tonight is Master Yeung of Hong Sing Restaurant. Our challenger is from Hong Kong. Private kitchen's top chef, Ms. Yau. Concentrate. Let's begin. Today's ingredient is the world-famous Hokkaido fresh milk. Prepare the bowls. Bring me the eggs. Give me the strawberries. Bowl. Yes. Milk? I've never cooked milk. It's not in mom's cookbooks. I never liked milk. Don't treat it like milk. Keep your mind a blank slate. Come. Smell it first. Smells good? Touch it. Feel its texture. Dab it. Taste it. Cooking is like making love. You have to feel it, explore it, and find the essence. It's a simple meal. Would've cooked more had I known. Every time my ship docked in Hong Kong, ...you always cooked a banquet. I knew because I could smell them downstairs. I was waiting to see when you'd come up. I'm here now, ain't I? - Come and eat - Thanks. Turned out morn cooked all the dishes was to wait for dad's return. I still don't know why they parted. Eight years was a long time. One was cooking upstairs. The other smelling it downstairs. Neither would take the initiative. It must've been a tough knot. Everything suddenly emerged in my mind. Maybe because I need the most courage now. One has to be confident and brave, girl. Don't hesitate. Just do it. Or your life would be full of regrets. I'm off. Dad said next time he wouldn't leave. I blocked this memory for so long because dad never came back. The milk is very thick. A bit like the soya milk mom used to make. Can we freeze it into cubes? Like tofu'? I read it in some magazine. Hokkaido's pasture is rich in calcium. Treating the milk like tofu may work. Let's add gelatin and freeze it. It should congeal quickly. Go. I'll make an appetizer. Seasoned eggs, sea urchins, and dried shrimps. Open mom's cookbook volume 6. Cook it like that tofu dish. I told you I won't open the cookbooks. You can open them now. Trust me. - Really'? - Yes. Go. The milk is so fresh and sweet. We can add coconut milk to make Portuguese Chicken. I've tried it in school, I can handle that. And... papaya milk. How about dessert? I have something in mind. Pick a good papaya. I'll tell you later. Still missing one dish. We'll figure it out. Let's move it. Time's up. Master Yeung's dishes are Seafood and Milk Egg Rolls. Fried Stonefish with Milk, and Milk Sauteed Beef. Milk Noodle with Spicy Sauce. The dessert is Milky White Bunnies. Challenger Yau's dishes are Appetizer: Tri-colored Frozen Milk. Swallow's Nest and Milk Eggs. First drill a hole and drain the egg white and yolk. Then inject milk and add swallows nest. Steam it at 4O degrees. Milky Papaya and Scallop with Rice. Steam the rice with milk instead of water. Add scallops. Dinosaur Egg. It's Portuguese chicken strips with milk, coconut milk and curry sauce. The texture's just like tofu. Yet the Hokkaido milk's taste remains. Delicious. Here's our judges' consolidated opinion. Master Yeung's dishes are excellent in traditional style. Challenger Yau, on the other hand, took a much more creative approach. Her dishes are warm and delicate. More importantly, they are full of bliss and joy. The result of the contest is A tie. We have to go into overtime. The chefs will each cook one more dish. The challenger has something to say. Go ahead, Ms. Yau. Please. Please translate for me. Okay. I never really enjoyed cooking. When I was a kid, I was even anorexic. Now I run a private kitchen. But it's been just a job to me. Tonight's contest makes me realize, cooking is like the love I've been waiting for. A feeling of bliss is what I've always needed. During the contest, while I was cooking, I had someone in my mind throughout. This is the first time I feel such bliss and happiness. Now I know the essence of cooking and love. It's sincerity and dedication. I may not be the best chef in the world. But I hope when all my friends taste the dishes I cook, they can taste that sense of bliss. Winning or losing doesn't mean much now. I found something more important tonight. Love is not a contest. Tonight, I want to thank someone. Thank you. I think it should stay a tie, too. Master Yeung agrees with a tie. Thanks a lot, Keung. Thank you for lying for us back then. No big deal. Glad to be helpful. I'm off now. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Kwai, I don't feel good about lying to Yau. Just for now. I'll confess to her later that Chun Yao and I made up your last name as Auyoung. We helped you break the ice. It's all up to you now. Later, Kwai apologized to me for lying. I wasn't angry. She's my best friend. She and Mock parted. May is still her old self. She comes to my restaurant occasionally. But we are quite distant now. It's an odd feeling seeing her everytime. Chun Yao hasn't found a new girlfriend. He's still determined to find the dream girl. Watch out. I love you, Ho. What'? I love you very much. What's that all about? Nobody understands Chinese here. I told you I'd do it, but I never said where. Cheater. Me? Who cheated first? Me? Mr. Ho? Sorry. I shouldn't have lied. Look at you. I'm not mad. Let's go that way. I'm sure mom is the biggest liar of all. The curse was just a metaphor of her marriage. But love is like life. It could be magical or cursed. In the end, it's all up to you.
