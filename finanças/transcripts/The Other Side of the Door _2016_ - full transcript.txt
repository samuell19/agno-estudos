THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR Translation. Review by Angel MUMBAI, INDIA People are throwing colored powder, and buckets of water at each other, and I keep getting hit in the face with this stuff. So at this point, I must look like some kind of crazy clown. All the while, we are trying to carry on... this incredibly serious discussion... about antique furniture. He is telling me about this piece that... He found that he thinks I might like. Then, out of nowhere, he says... I am pregnant. Seriously? It is beautiful. It is crazy. Baby, I do not want to go back. What if would we stay here? Started a family here. Are you serious? Why not? I have to come three times a year to source antiques anyway. What has to keep us setting up our base here? What do you think? I do not know. Is this yours? Hey. What are you saying? I am asking her if you and I... should stay here forever. SIX YEARS LATER How can you sleep? So peacefully! Sweetheart, stop. Stop. Stop! Stop. It is okay, it is okay, and I am here. - It is not okay! - It is okay. Stop it. Stop it. It is all right!

Where is Michael? He is talking to the Doctor. You are lucky to be alive, Mrs. Harwood. I just cannot bear life without him. I had a daughter once. Anushka. She fell into a pond while trying to pick some plants. I was looking away for only one minute. What if could I bring your son back to you just one more time? What if could I give you the chance to say your final goodbye? What are you talking about? I was born in a village in South India. Surrounding our village was a big forest. In addition, deep within this forest... there was an abandoned Temple. It is said that the line between... the World of the Dead and the Living... is very thin at this place. You should go there. Take the ashes of your son... spread them on the steps of this Temple... lock yourself inside, and when the night comes... He will come to you. Moreover, you will be able to talk to him, through the door of the Temple... say your final goodbye. I will leave you two alone. I was so scared I lost you. I am sorry. I am so... so sorry. Come on. Come on, boy. If we do this. You have to promise me one thing. When Oliver comes to you at the Temple. You will be able to speak to him. However, no matter what you do... no matter what he says, or how much ever he pleads... You must not open the door. You promise me. I promise. It has been too long. Let me go. Khan! They are the Aghori. They live by the cremation sites. They cover themselves in the ashes. In addition, they feed off the flesh of the Dead. They believe it helps them communicate with the Other Side. My village is the last stop, then follow my instructions. God, Michael. I will give him your note. No, he is going to be frantic, and Lucy needs to know where I am. I will take care of everything. Dear Michael, please do not be worried. I am just taking a couple of days to sort my head out. I desperately want to find a way to move on. So, we can be a family again. I love you and Lucy so... so much. I will be home soon, Maria. I love you so much. Who is there? Oliver? Who are you? Oliver? Mommy? Mommy, is that you? Oliver, it is Mommy. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, I can hear you. Where am I, Mommy? Baby, press yourself close. Come up right against the door and press yourself close. We can be close together, okay. Are you there? Yes, Mommy. Oliver, I miss you. I miss you so much, baby. Do you know I love you, right? More than life itself. I miss you, too. I miss Daddy and Lucy. Oliver, Mommy has something to tell you. I came here because... I wanted to say that I am sorry. I am sorry for leaving you. It was not your fault. I love you, Mommy. Baby, I think about you day and night. I wish I could hold you in my arms. The door will not open. I cannot get in. I know, baby. I am not allowed to let you in. It is dark out here. I want to come in. I am sorry. I cannot do it. Please, Mommy, open the door. I want to hug you. It is okay, baby. It is okay to cry. Mommy is crying, too. I have to go now, Mommy. What? I have to go back now, Mommy. No! No, you just got here. No, please. Baby, no, do not go. You do not go. I just want a few more minutes, okay? Just a few more minutes, baby. Please, please, Oliver? Where are you? Ollie? Oliver? Oliver? I love you, baby. Maria? Maria? Maria? There is nobody out here. Quiet! Friend, what is wrong with you? Relax. Are you all right? Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing up? Is Mommy home? No, not yet, she will be soon. Let us get you back to bed. Come on. Would you give me the ball, ma'am? Thank you a lot. How much tea would you like? The whole glass. That is not how you are supposed to drink tea. You are supposed to drink tea like this. Khan? Where did you come from? KEEP OUT Mommy? Hello. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. Stop it! That tickles! Lucy, let us get Winston a snack. - Come. Come. - Come on, Winston. Come. I was worried sick. Where were you? I was trying to get better. You could not have... We would have come with you. I know, I know. Hey, I am back. I am back. I am back for you. I am back for Lucy. What is going on? It is okay, it is all right! It is just Winston. I got him. It is all right. Go to bed. Go to bed. Mommy is here now. Miss Lucy? Where are you? My name is… L.I L.I Chicka-Ni, Chicka-Ni. My name is… L.I L.I Chicka-Ni, Chicka-Ni. My name is… L.I L.I Chicka... Hello, Mommy? What are you doing in here, Lucy? I am just playing with my dolls. In addition, who were you talking to? Just my dolls. Okay. Well, you know that Mommy... does not like people playing up here, right? So, how about we go back downstairs. Okay, Mommy. Scoot, scoot, scoot. Mommy, are you coming? Yeah, I will be right there, baby. O. L. I. V. R Miss Lucy, that sounds abs... Hey, Lucy, where did you get Khan? Hey. Hey, look at me, Lucy. I have something to show you, but it is a secret. Lucy, I need you to tell me, where did you get the Tiger, okay? Did Piki give him to you? Look, Mommy. Lucy, please stop. Lucy. Lucy, I need to talk to you about... Oliver comes back, Mommy. Nighty-night, sleep you tight. You do not let the bedbugs bite. You will not tell Daddy, will you? About Oliver. Why do you say that, love? I think Oliver is hiding. Who is he hiding from? He does not want to tell me. You just do not tell Daddy. Well, what if we wait until, Oliver is ready to tell him. Promise? Yeah, I promise. Get some sleep. I love you. Good night! Good night! Sleep tight. And you do not let the bedbugs bite. THE JUNGLE BOOK Okay. Okay, let us see where we left off. Directly in front of him holding on by a low branch... stood a naked brown baby, who could just barely walk... as soft and as dimpled a little atom, as ever came to a Wolf's cave at night. Wow! Hey, sweetheart? I was just coming to find you. Did I miss say good night to Lucy? It is okay. I kissed her good night for you. Okay. I am sorry, I was late. It is okay. Are you all right? You are trembling. I do not know. What is going on? I do not know. No, no, I am fine. I am fine. I am good. I am really, good. All right! Hello? Hello? Hello? Oliver, where are you? What is going on? What happened? What happened, baby? - Are you all right? - It is a dream. Just a dream. - Sorry. - Are you okay? Yeah. Mommy? Mommy? What is it, baby? Chill and Bill are dead. What? No, I am so sorry. The gardener found all the fish dead in the pond. Moreover, all the plants are dying. Can we bury Chill and Bill in the sea? In the sea? Piki said that people in India was buried in the sea. Of course! Yes, we can. How about you go get something to bury them in? You should have worn white. I wore a white scarf, is not that enough? No. I am sorry. I did not mean to be rude to Chill and Bill. It is a good spot right here. Good-bye, Chill! Good-bye, Bill! Mommy, who is that man? It is all right, baby. He is far away. Not that man, Mommy! That man! Why did that man put ash on your face? I do not know love. Did I get it all? Yeah, you got it. Yeah? Lucy stays behind me. Oliver? Oliver, do you want to play? Are you coming out to play, Stanley? I cannot. Someone painted the wall pink. I got the blame. Detective Calamity at your service, Sir. Do we have any clues? He did it! He did it! What is it, Winston? It sounds as you need a detective. Look at you, right where you belong. Okay, baby girl. Let us get those nits out. I do not have nits. Nits like clean hair, Daddy told me. Okay, well, then you certainly do not have them, grumpy-stilts kin. Turn around. Turn around. Come on, come on, come on, come on, and come on! Lucy, what happened to your shoulder? I do not think I like Oliver anymore. He is mean! Oliver, I saw those bite marks on Lucy. You cannot hurt your sister, all right? I said no. Oliver let me out. Okay. I will read to you. As long as you, promise not hurt Lucy again. Will you promise me? Sire Khan moved through the forest. He heard the thunder of their hooves, and lumbered down the ravine... looking from side to side for any way of escape. KEEP OUT Hello? Hey, darling. How was your day? Did you have funny with Lucy? Yeah, I just put her in the bed. Okay. Well! I am sorry, but I have to be here for a couple more hours. Shall I ask Piki to keep something warm for you to eat? Yeah! No, it is okay. I will just go to grab something here. However, I just want to tell you that I miss you. I miss you, too. All right. I love you. Give Lucy a kiss for me. I will do. I love you, too. Bye. Oliver? I see you there. I will call the police! Go on! Go. Go! Get out! Get out of my house! You have no idea what you have done. Did you think that you could bring back… somebody from the World of the Dead? Moreover, they would be the same. Did you think there would be no consequences? I do not understand. Hindus believe in the purification, and reincarnation of the soul. That can never happen to Oliver now. Because he returned to this life. Instead, his soul will putrefy. You have seen her, have not you? Myrtu. She is getting closer to this World every day. When you opened the door. You upset the balance between Life and Death. Moreover, you awoke her. She is the gatekeeper of the Underworld. She is here to take back Oliver to the World of the Dead. And she will destroy anything that comes in her way. Oliver is no longer your son, Mrs. Harwood. Do you understand what I am telling you? He is Evil. Burn every possession of his. Destroy every photograph. Get rid of anything, which is an anchor for him to this life. Moreover, pray that he will return to the World of the Dead. Are you are out of your mind? I should never have told you about the Temple! I thought I was trying to help you. Lucy? Baby? Hey? Are you okay? Lucy? Mommy? You woke me up. Are you okay? Yes. Yes. Come on, I have to dry. I just think it would be a good idea. I mean. I cannot remember the last time Lucy saw her cousins. I know. It would be amazing! I...I would love that. I am just not sure it is the best timing for business, but... You are always saying that you never have any time to relax. You know, she has a month before she starts school. In addition, we have not been to the States for so long. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am fine. Yeah? You seem somewhat flushed. I am just coming down with something. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? - Lucy? - Lucy? Lucy! I will go look for her out front. Lucy? Lucy? Mommy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Mommy? Lucy? Lucy! Maria? Hey. Michael, where were you? She just was out front. I tried to tell you, but you run off. I could not find you. I know you are there. Oliver, stop it! Amma? Amma? Anushka! Look, Mommy. It is Oliver's book. Thank you. What is this? I am not sure. Maria? Maria? Michael? What? Lucy comes here. - Stay there. - Okay, I got you. - I got you. It is okay. - What is it, Mommy? It is okay. And when the drawbridge closed with a bang. All the people were safe inside. And deep in the dark forest the Dragon curled up in a heaper, and went to sleep. I think you can curl up in a heaper and go to sleep now. You do not think that Oliver did that to Piki, do you? No. No, I think what happened to Piki was... just a terrible… terrible accident. Are you sure? Yes, I am. Now, how about do you hop into bed? It was a long day, little one. Can Winston sleep with me tonight? I suppose that is a yes, is not it? You do not hog all the bed. You have sweet dreams. I love you. Is Piki in heaven now? I think so, yes. Why is not Oliver in heaven? It is time for bed, sweet girl. I will see you in the morning. THE JUNGLE BOOK Lucy? Baby, are you all right? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy! Lucy! Lucy? Lu... Lucy? Are you in here? Baby, are you hiding from...? No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no! Lucy? Lucy. My God! Sweet girl, you scared me... So much. What are you doing out here, baby? I wanted to feel the wind on my skin. It tickles. Okay. Okay, come on. Let us go to bed. Hey people, what is going on? Daddy! Hey, you. What are you doing out here so late, pumpkin? I think she might be sleepwalking. I missed you, Daddy. I missed you, too, sweetheart. How about do we get you back to bed? Come on. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. What...? What? - Michael. - No, no, no. Michael? No. No! Michael. It has to be burnt It has to be burnt. What? Why? Because Oliver came back. No. What? Oliver came back, and I think he killed Piki. Because she tried to burn all of his things to send him back. Because he is not our boy anymore. Stop. Darling stop. I know it sounds crazy however, it is true. Right, Lucy? Right? I do not know what you are talking about, Mommy. No, no, baby, it is okay. It is okay. We can tell Daddy now. Tell him about your brother. Tell him about the piano. Tell him about the piano. I do not know what you are saying. Oliver is dead! Lucy, I do not know why you are doing this right now, okay? However, you need to tell your father the truth. You need to tell him. I do not know what you mean, Mommy. Lucy, you have to tell him! Enough! Enough! You are scaring her. Lucy, I am sorry. I am sorry, but... It is all right. Let us go you to the bed, sweetheart. All right. There you are. Do you feel better poppet? Now that you are here, Daddy. You sleep well, okay. I love you. I love you, too. Lucy, please tell Daddy about Oliver. Maria, sweetheart, you are not thinking straight. - Can we talk about this downstairs? - I am not making it up. I am not making it up. I understand you do not think you are making it up, but I... What? Oliver, what have you done? Maria? He possessed her. Maria, would you listen to yourself? No, no, no, no, no! Oliver? Maria? We can be together again. You leave your sister alone! Daddy, I am scared! Stop! Come here, sweetheart. It is going to be all right. Michael. You need help. I am going to get you the help you need, and everything is going to be okay. Okay. Are you all right sweetheart? Mommy was hurting me. No, no, Mommy is not just herself right now. However, she loves you very much. In addition, so do I. Where are we going? We are going on a little adventure. What do you want? Okay. Just stay here. I am going to make a quick call, okay, sweetheart? Everything is going to be fine. Okay. Come on. Come on. Hello. Hi. Yes, okay, my address is Dobra Villa, Sat rah, Carter Road, in Bandha. Yes, there is a group of men outside of my house. I think they are trying to break in, and get my daughter. I am not sure, but I need help immediately. Bad dog. Yes, yes. As fast as you can. Quiet. I do not know, but they are naked almost. Okay, please hurry. Yes. Lucy, what...? My God! Baby. What did you do? Winston was being naughty. Therefore, I had to teach him a lesson. You are not going to be naughty as well, are you, Daddy? No! It is just Mommy and me now. I am sorry, Daddy. I did not mean to hurt you. You are making a mess all over the kitchen floor. Mommy will be mad. Lucy, what are you doing? I am not Lucy. I am Oliver. No. However, I am! Michael? Michael? Michael? Oliver? Help me, Mommy! Help me, Mommy! Leave her alone! Lucy? - Mommy. - Lucy!
