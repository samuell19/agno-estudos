Why is it always the dead ting to start talking? - She's not dead. - Don't talk to my friend like that. - Or what? - Or you'll move from her, man. What? Do you want me to wet you up? I ain't scared of you. Do you know who I am? Yeah, you're Peckham man, Skitz, innit? He's not from around here so he don't know you. - Where you from? - I'm from Deptford. Ghetto boy, yeah? No, I'm not a ghetto boy, I just live in Deptford. Wet my man up. Leave him alone. - Sayin'... - Timmy, run! Move from my boy! What are you doing? Hey, are you man mad? Don't let me wet you up as well. - Go on, do it! - Chill, chill. Nah, nah, nah. I'll wet this little prick up first. Then I'll wet this little pussio up. Then I'll wet this Mickey-Mouse-looking bitch up! Are you dumb? Do you not know that's Switcher's little brother? Shit. - Yeah. - All right. Sorry, fam, man. I didn't know, fam. Yo, Skitz, why are you man troubling my boy for? How are you friends with a ghetto yout? Does your brother know? We just ducked them fools out their own ends. Bruv, he's not ghetto, he just lives in the area. He don't know any of them. Obviously he's gonna tell you that when he goes to school here! If you live in them ends, you're one of them. Ask your brother. Skitz, I be real, man. Hear all of that, but that's my boy, innit? Hey, yo, chill, man. It's not worth it, bro. Fuckin' pussy. Fuck's sake. You know, I actually asked my brother why do Peckham beef ghetto? And what did he say? He said, "Cos them man there, they're pagans." Well, why are they pagans, though? What does "pagans" even mean, fam? Bruv, I dunno, man. All I know is, if you're from ghetto, you don't wanna bump up into my brother and that guy, he hates them. Is that why your brother don't like me, then? Cos I live in this area? Bruv, what do you mean my brother don't like you? Of course he likes you. No. He doesn't chat to me the same way he chats to Dwayne and Hakeem and that. It's only cos he's known them longer, bro. My brother knows you're my guy. Trust me. You want something from the shop? Nah, I'm cool, man. Shut up, man. I'm gonna get you a Supermalt and some chocolate. - Ah, cool, cool, cool. - Yes, yes! My bro. Oh, my days! Man like Timmy, you know. - What? - Oh, my days, blood. This guy! Blood, man, I hasn't seen you for 175 years, cuz! I know. Long time, though. How you been, Kiron? Man said Kiron! All right, listen, listen, listen. Yo, forget that. Call me Killy. That's what everyone calls a man now. - What you sayin', though, cuz? - I'm good, man. Blood, come like you disappeared and left, man, after primary school? You know how my mum is. She had different plans. Run the shit anyway. Roughton kicked man out. This guy. You still punch a man up, yeah? Aye, listen, listen, listen. You, man, you see this brother here? He can rock, you know? Blood, he smacked out Shyro's lights in primary school. And you know how Shyro gets. Blood, listen. I didn't. Listen. I swear I know you. - No, I don't recognise you from nowhere. - Should have recognised him. - Bruv, who you talking to like that? - What? Yeah, blood! Man like Timmy, you know? T, T, light up, man. Listen. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault, bruv. Sorry. Sometimes I get faces mixed up, innit? Don't watch nothing. Man will see you about anyway, yeah? Take care, cuz. Yeah? Let's go, man. Come, man. It's nothing, bro. Come, man. - Pussios, bruv. - It's cool, man. Oh, whatever, man. That was a fluke, man. What d'you mean fluke, boy? You're dead. Dinner is ready, all right?

Are you joking? - "These man should retire." - "They're not built for it." - Retire what? Are you mad? Gimme that. We need to pattern up, bro. They're making man look like some clowns. Oi, where's the rest of the man dem, fam? As soon as them man get here, we're making a move, yeah? Nah, man, that's bait. It's broad daylight. Feds will wrap us up straight away.
