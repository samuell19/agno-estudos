("Rock Star" playing) Moana: ♫ (lyrics) I dream of being a big rock star, ♫ with my fancy clothes and my red guitar Eva: ♫ I dream of my brand new car ♫ that can take me far from here Eva and Moana: ♫ Mmmh, and it's not hard ♫ When it's in your heart ♫ From the very start, chase your dreams ♫ I want to do ♫ Whatever it takes, whatever it takes to make it ♫ I wanna show whoever I can, ^♫ however I can, I'll be a big rock star ^Eva: ♫ I dream of being a big rock star ^♫ With my fancy clothes and my red guitar ^Moana: ♫ I dream of my brand new car ^♫ That will take me far from here Eva and Moana: ♫ Mmmh and it's not hard, ♫ When it's in your heart, ♫ From the very start, chase your dreams (audience booing) ♫ I want to do ♫ Whatever I can, whatever it takes to make it. ♫ I want to show ♫ Whoever I can, however I can I'll be a big rock star ♫ (loud booing) Moana: You always get us into these situations! Eva: Oh yeah it's always my fault? Moana: You wanted to come work. Eva: Yeah I wanted to work. (high pitched scream) Let's get out of here! (riot booing) (heavy metal music) Strip Club Hustler: Want to see the show? Five dollars! Want to see the show? Want to see the show? Come guys let's do it! Five dollars! (intense music) (sirens howling) (high-tech music) Matt: How was it? Don't worry, it often feels like that the first time. Come and have something to eat, and you'll feel better. Trust me, have something to eat and you'll feel better. Not long now before the Pluto Probe arrives. Moana: What happened to the riot? Matt: There was no riot. You just had your first dream. It's all in your head. (chair scraping the floor) Star: How was it last night? Eva: It was good. Star: Tell us about it. Eva: I was the lead dancer at an Australian dance company. I was fantastic and I got a standing ovation. Star: And was there any after show flirtation? Anything you would like to share? Eva: How was your night? Star: My night was great! I played the shy virgin and was well and truly ravaged. What is this? Brunette member: It's for rituals. Star: Rituals? What sort? Short haired member: Fertility rites. Star: Archaeological information suggests that it took three successive races three hundred years to build Stonehenge. Now the construction work probably took the same amount of social resources in the years that it was build, as it has taken to build the Pluto Probe today. Eva: Angel just left a message; she wants to see us straight away. You better get your things. Moana: Which one's mine? Moana: Hey! I didn't go for the virtual group stuff. Eva: You pussy! Moana: Fuck you! Eva: You'd be lucky! Moana: We were doing a street show outside the opera house. There was a civil war, or a riot or something. Eva: That's normal. I had the audience attack me with knives. Moana: Your biggest fear, the audience. (amused laugh) Moana: How is it affecting us to have these experiences? Eva: It's all about letting go of who we are, so we can grow into someone new. Moana: Letting go of who we are. Eva: It's just like watching TV. Moana: It feels so real. Besides, I choose what I watch on television. Eva: You get to choose what you dream later on. It gets better. Moana: It would have to. Why did she put you on the spot like that at breakfast? Eva: [the-laine] is that you have to share your virtual experiences so you recognize them for the illusions they are. Moana: And your take on it is? You don't usually [stick-the-lai]. What's your take on it? Eva: I like it when you get fiesty. (pop music playing) Moana: You ready? You are. Eva: I just need to do my salute. Moana: You've already done this while warm-up. Eva: You know how important this is to me. You stop. Moana: Hey guys we are here just rehearsing for the big press conference. Thought we would give you online viewers a bit of a behind-the-scenes preview. ("I Know Who I Am" playing) Eva and Moana: ♫ I'm just a girl who finally understands Moana: ♫ That's who I am Eva: ♫ That's who I am, I know who I am Moana: ♫ This life is changing on us everyday Eva and Moana:♫ Sometimes we all get lost upon our way ♫ Back home, everybody understands ♫ Just who I am, they know who I am, ♫ They know who I am Eva: ♫ Now I know, now I know ♫ Just who I am ♫ Now I know, now I know ♫ Just who I am Moana: ♫ That's who I am. Eva and Moana: ♫ I know who I am ♫ Angel: I'd like to welcome you to the launch of the Butterfly Crush entry into the Australiasian song awards. You should all have a folder with bio, lyrics and a DVD. Interviewer: You've made much of your sexual relationship in the past. We don't hear about that recently. Is it still vital in your music? Eva: We're giving one another some, freedom, within the relationship. Interviewer: But there are rumors of a romantic split? Moana: I hope our music transcends our personal relationship. Interviewer: Isn't it true that you are now involved with that virtual sex group in King's Cross? Eva: You ask that as if it was something weird. We have virtual technology around us every day. In our games, our schools and libraries. Interviewer: But not virtual sex? Eva: Ever watched an adult movie? It's just a matter of where you draw the limits. And we like to push the limits a little. Moana: Look, we sing and we do it very well. And that's what's important. That's what people want to know. Not some emotional grubbing around. I mean, sure, sexuality is an important part of our work but, that's just because it is an important part of everyone's life. Moana: You just provoke them. Eva: The ask for it. Besides, it's good PR. Angel: This is the recording contract for the awards, outlining the promotional requirements on the winners. You each need to sign one. Moana: I don't think we are ready for this. Eva: Typical. Eva: I need to take this home and read it before I can sign it. Moana: But Eva, this is everything you've dreamed of! Eva: Yeah, that's why I want to be sure. Angel: Just remember the Dallen had a gig tomorrow. You need to be there early for sound checks. Eva: Hey, come along tonight. It's better than anything! Angel: Is it the dream group that she is talking about? Moana: She's been spending all of her time there. Angel: You have to let her go. Find someone new. (dance music) Star: Good evening. Now, the Pluto encounter, which we will all be witnessing in the next couple of days, is going to be the first chance that we are going to have to see our solar system's binary planet close up. Now Charon, which was originally thought to be a moon of Pluto, actually turned out to be nearly the same size. Brunette group member: But what about God? (ridiculing laughter) Star: Do I come over to your place and disturb your evening? Star: Do I come over to your place and disturb your evening? Star: The crazy one can go. I understand this kiwi in shining armor is the other half of the performing duo that you've been telling us so much about. Well, I can only hope that you will honor us all this evening with a small performance, as you are both here. Eva: Shall we do "Break Your Fall"? ("Break Your Fall" playing) Moana: ♫ (lyrics) Don't be afraid of the mess you make ♫ Make a mess, make amends, ♫ Make your enemies your friends ♫ Don't be afraid of the devil saying, "Dare you" Eva: ♫ Won't be scared there's nothing there Eva and Moana: ♫ When you feel alive ♫ Alive enough to feel. ♫ Are you willing to try ♫ Crash dive into something real ♫ Not too hard and then too fast, ♫ We're in charge, take a chance ♫ Dirty up your pretty head ♫ Do all the things you thought you'd never do ♫ Go in deep, (mumbling) ♫ (mumbling) ♫ (applause) Star: I can only offer free drinks to both of you in gratitude. (dance music) Matt: Hey, you looked fantastic tonight! Moana: Thanks. Matt: Do you do that in all your videos? Moana: Yes. Matt: Well, maybe you should come by then and show me sometime? Moana: Sure. Matt: It's all about the contact, you've got to change that. Most of them are just desperate for some personal contact, so if you show them some, you're (mumbling). Matt: Hi Moana, good to see you! Dark haired client: Yes good, very good! Moana: If you're busy I can come back. Matt: No, it's OK. Moana: You wanted to see our videos? Matt: You just want to give us a call later and we will continue this when we're alone. Dark haired client: Sure Matt: Come take a seat, Moana. Moana: So, have you had much contact with Eva while she has been here? Matt: Sure. Moana: How is she doing? Matt: She is great. Moana: You know, what's the gos? (laughs) Matt: I'm not good with gos. Moana: Guys. (quiet laughter) Matt: So you're going to show me your stuff? Moana: Mhm, yeah, sure. Matt: I'll just watch this another day. So... (Butterfly Crush playing) Matt: Looks like you two are an item? Moana: We were. Matt: Were? Moana: Yeah. Matt: So are you bisexual? Moana: Why? Matt: Oh, just wondering. Moana: Just wondering if I'm interested in a normal relationship? Matt: No, we have open relationships here. Moana: Open relationships? So you all fuck whenever. (laughs) Matt: Well, not all at once. Moana: Really? Matt: It's like a special thing. Moana: Take, take, five, one, two, three. My name is Moana and I am from Butterfly Crush. Is that OK? Angel: Yep, great, we are done. Eva: Are you sure you have done OK? Moana: Well, no thanks to you. Eva: Well let's do it again now. You know I don't feel comfortable unless I've completely checked the (mumbling). Moana: Well maybe you should arrive on time. Angel: Sorry, we can't do it again. I've got two more mics to check. Moana: Did you sleep over at the Dreamguides again? Eva: Yeah. Moana: Another sleep with benefits? Was it a boy or a girl? Eva: Girl. Moana: What is this Eva? What is happening with you? Eva: I'm going to be in the Charon group. Moana: What? Eva: I'm going to join the Dreamguides. Moana: And you're going to live there? So, like you said, we'll be giving one another a bit of freedom. Eva: Well, we are. I mean, I think we should keep saying that, for the media. Moana: Don't you think you should take your time with this? Eva: Let me make my own decisions. Moana: Will this change how we work? Eva: Don't see why it should. Eva: Will you come with me tonight? I need a partner to give me away at the ceremony. Moana: Too bitter, huh? Eva: Well, it would be best if you would join the group too. Why not, it would be perfect. I mean, then we could be together and have the freedom. Have I ever lead you into trouble? Moana: Uhm, all the time! (quiet laughing) (sensual music) Matt: Thanks for waiting! Aw. Moana: So, what's the story with this initiation? Matt: What story? Moana: Why am I here? Matt: Didn't Eva tell you? Well, you should really talk to her about it then. Moana: What do you mean? Well it's... a unique situation. OK, I'm not too sure what the deal is. Moana: That doesn't sound very convincing. Matt: Hey wait, what are you... (playful screams) Star: I'm really pleased that you are both here. OK. Let's loosen up a bit, shall we? Close your eyes. And turn to the person next to you. Now I want you to explore your partners face with your fingers, so that you can remember them. (nervous giggling) Now, keeping your eyes closed, turn from your partner and move around the room. (light music) Now, find your partner again. And no peeking! Eva: Just sign there. If you dare. Star: Close your eyes. Now, I'm going to blow on you, and it is going to feel like a wind blowing you. That you can't resist. (soft blow) (loud applause) (mild applause) Angel: I had this checked by a couple of experts. It's pretty deadly. You are going to have to tread carefully. Moana: Why is it deadly? Angel: It's a management agreement. Moana: What do you mean? Angel: You have signed the management of Butterfly Crush over to the Dreamguides. Moana: No. Angel: Did you read it? Moana: No, I didn't. I couldn't. Angel: Why not? You've been spending a lot of time there lately? Moana: I'm just trying to help Eva. And you're not being very supportive. Angel: Did you ask anything? Or did you just sign it? Moana: Of course I did! I asked for more information. Angel: And? Moana: They started playing these games with me. I think by the end of it I was in a bit of a trance. What else makes it deadly? Angel: It ties up the management so you have no control over your work. You don't benefit from it financially. Moana: Oh. Angel: If it wasn't entered into freely, a good lawyer can probably get you out of it. I'll have it checked. Moana: So what's our strategy? Angel: You mentioned something about some sessions with Eva. Something called feedback sessions? Moana: It's more like counseling. There is one tomorrow. Angel: I think you should go. If you feel up to it. Moana: Don't worry. We'll get her back. Eva: I've got a (mumbling) to do in this life, and I'm going to honor that. That is what brought me here and learning and growing from it. My music is getting stronger for it. Star: Would you like to share some of that music? Eva: Yeah, sure Eva: ♫ (lyrics) And the truth is, ♫ Our mistakes do not define us ♫ Truth is shame doesn't have to bind us ♫ Truth is our life will always find us ♫ Dare us to come alive ♫ Oh, dare us to come alive ♫ Star: Wow. So, what can we say to Eva? Red head: She was fantastic. That's wonderful having a newcomer express herself so honestly. Brunette: I'm totally in love with Eva. She is so fresh and articulate. You can see she has experience on the stage. Star: So she brings out your bisexual side? Brunette: Absolutely. Star: You truly are an emerging talent. And we are going to make sure that you go far. So what's the story with this singing partner of yours? Eva: We are giving each other a bit of space. Star: Have you talked with her about joining at all? Eva: Yes. Star: Uninterested? Eva: She'll take a bit of persuading. Star: Well lets see how we do in the feedback session tomorrow. Otherwise we may have to be quite firm with her. Purely to free you of the emotional burden so that you can focus on your work. Matt: I'm coming to the show tonight. Can we meet up afterwards? Moana: Here in the real world? Come and buy me a drink. You don't want to? Matt: It's just that I don't have any money. And Eva said she was going to let me in but she is not here yet. I just wanted to talk with you before we started. (soft guitar music) Moana: Are you under instruction to be here? Matt: I am to keep an eye on you. Because you are important to Eva. Which is fortunate seeing as I really like you. Moana: And yet you betrayed me. You avoided telling me what was really going on. Matt: I told you. And I didn't think it really mattered. Look, Moana. Anything I do with you, I do with your best interest at heart. Moana: Have you been together with Eva? Matt: There's a quarantine period of six weeks before any new members can have sexual relations, so. We have to be real careful if someone catches it. Otherwise it spreads through the whole group. (cell phone rings) Moana: I have to go to work. I can get you in if you want? Come on. Hey, how come you don't have any cash? Matt: Normally I don't need to. We have communifiers at the group. And I don't get pocket money for this sort of thing. Moana: Lets say you want to go to a film, or to the theater? Matt: I never need to. There is always something happening back home. (dance music) Moana: He's with me. Eva: Hi. Moana: Are you OK? Eva: Great! How long until we're on? Moana: Well you're late, and we are on now. Eva: What are you waiting for? Moana: You. Eva: For me? Moana: Eva, I'm really worried. Eva: There is no need to be worried. Moana: You are changing in ways I don't even think you realize. Eva: How? Moana: You're volatile and blowing up at me for the slightest things. Eva: I'm always like that. Moana: You're not committed to our work. You are missing sound checks. Eva: I'm here when it matters. ("Come Alive" playing) Moana: ♫ Face over heels, you fell into disaster ♫ Ever since then, you're only running faster ♫ Everyone knows you'll never outrun yourself ♫ Eva: Still everyone tries in one way or another, ♫ Because we forgot some tracks we'd like to cover ♫ I wonder if it's time we all face the truth Moana and Eva:♫ And the truth is, ♫ Our mistakes do not define us ♫ Truth is, shame doesn't have to bind us ♫ Truth is, our life will always find us ♫ Dare us to come alive ♫ Oh, dare us to come alive ♫ What if we trusted all that we believe in ♫ What if we moved from fear and into freedom ♫ What if in freedom we could forgive ourselves ♫ And the truth is our mistakes do not define us ♫ Truth is shame doesn't have to bind us ♫ Truth is our lives will always find us ♫ Dare us to come alive ♫ Oh, dare us to come alive ♫ Oh yeah, and the truth is, ♫ Our mistakes do not define us ♫ Truth is shame doesn't have to bind us ♫ Truth is that life will always find us ♫ Dare us to come alive ♫ Oh, dare us to come alive ♫ Dare us to come alive ♫ (cheering and applause) (door squeaking) Star: Glad you could make it. Welcome Moana. What you need to learn to do is to compromise in your relationships. And understand that these desires are being controlled from your subconscious. These sessions will really help you learn that. Eva: Could we look at our relationship? Star: Of course. If we can key in Moana's birth data we can look at the relationships between both of your planets. Eva: What's the matter? Scared it might work? Star: Is that phone recording? Moana: What are you doing? Star: Thank you. Spy speaks too. You'll get it back. As soon as you have cooperated with our feedback session. Are you going to give us your birth details? (quiet laughter) Moana: I was born in Oakland. April fifth, 1988. Star: OK. Lets look at Mars and Venus. Matt: Sure. Your Mars is together with Moana's Venus. Do you find Eva to be the personification of physical, sexual beauty? But you sense this availablity and move to take advantage of that. Eva: That doesn't sound very romantic. Moana: You're not. Star: The problem that occurs with this placement is that sometimes the sexual arousal can be too pervasive and disorientating to be kept in perspective. When you add all of the creative work that you both do together, there would be a lot of riving and anticipation that wouldn't always find a comfortable avenue of expression. Moana: We've been slowly sorting that out. Star: Have you? I wouldn't be so certain. Because I'm not sure you would be here if you had. Lets look at the Plutos. Matt: Sure. Star: Now, Pluto doesn't move very fast and you are both at similar age, so your Plutos are very close together. Now, we saw that your Pluto is opposite your Venus? Which means that your Pluto is also opposite Eva's Venus, and her sun. Moana: And? Star: It means that you have a very volatile relationship. I feel that from these aspects, Eva can perceive you as a threat to her basic identity. Someone who wishes to control her. Moana: Why? I've never done anything. Eva: It's not what you do. Star: And that's exactly how you are going to feel. But what is most disturbing about this Pluto aspect is that you are obsessively drawn to Eva. And there is a primal anxiety in that obsession. Eva: So true. Obsessive and primal. Moana: Don't you see what is happening here? How she is manipulating you? Look lady, I'm not playing your little charade any longer so you can manipulate me with your psychological games. Eva: Well if you don't want to be here, then you better go. Star: Unfortunately I really don't think Moana is ever going to have the commitment required to benefit from our work. In fact, since we now don't want you here, I'm going to ask you to leave. Moana: Well can I have my phone? Star: No. I'm going to keep it for a little while, because I would like to see what you've actually got on here. Moana: But it's my phone. What if someone rings? Star: Matt, could you please show her out? And make sure she leaves. Matt: Hey are you OK? Moana: Of course not. Matt: Can I help? Moana: Not now, you could have back in there. Matt: No that's where you're wrong. There's nothing I could do. (fast-paced footsteps) (upbeat music) Moana: Glad you could make it. We worked hard to get here. And you have to keep your end up. No matter what wanky self mutilation you happen to be getting off on. I had to say it. Eva: Well I won't do them. Angel: You're part of this group too. I expect you to pull your weight just like the rest of us. I see what's happening here. I'm glad I can finally see it. Eva: I've got more important things to do with my time. Angel: More important than your career? Eva: More important than PR chores. Angel: I know they want to take over the management. Do you know that is what you agreed to? Eva: Star has mentioned it. How do you know? Moana: It was in the contract we signed the other day. I took a copy. Eva: You took a copy? Moana: I wanted to know what I was signing. Eva: I'm sure the management can be improved. Angel: How? Eva: Well we are always doing small gigs and look at all this extra PR shit I have to do. Angel: You barely keep it together as it is, and that's only because I make sure you do. What about the contract for the awards? Have you read it and signed it? Eva: I've given it to Star to submit. Angel: I don't need this shit. Eva: Neither do I. Moana: Guys! We've got a gig to do. (mellow music) Moana: ♫ We are changing wind ♫ From the outside in ♫ Underneath my skin, ♫ It's blowing my mind. Moana and Eva: ♫ (mumbling) ♫ But there was so much missed ♫ (mumbling) Moana and Eva: ♫ I've opened my eyes ♫ I'm a wide eyed girl with nothing to fear ♫ Under the weight of the world, ♫ That is waiting for me ♫ To let go of the past, I'm breaking free ♫ And out of the pack ♫ I'm becoming me ♫ (mumbling) ♫ I'll just hear the wind ♫ (mumbling) ♫ Into the sky ♫ I'm a wide eyed girl ♫ with nothing to fear ♫ Under the weight of the world ♫ That is waiting for me (static microphone) ♫ I'm breaking free Moana:♫ And out of the pack ♫ I'm becoming me ♫ With nothing to fear ♫ Under the weight of the world, ♫ That is waiting for me ♫ To let go of the past, ♫ I'm breaking free ♫ And out of the pack ♫ I'm becoming me. (applause) (mumbling) And we'll be back soon! Eva: I won't stand for sabotage. Moana: It's your own fault. You should have been there for the sound check. Eva: That's the problem. You bury yourself in this PR bullshit rather than challenge yourself to really be successful. Moana: This is our work. Not your personal therapy session. Eva: That's it! Moana: I've been working alone without her. What is to come? Angel: Come what of? Strange? Moana: It is strange. (bevarage pouring) What are we going to do? Angel: We threaten the group with legal action. We pressure them to support her work with us. Moana: I just wonder if we are loosing sight of Eva through all of this. She has made her decision, maybe we should respect that. Angel: Did she make if of her own free will? I'll have the lawyer draw up the letters. Do you think you could arrange to get it to the group? Moana: Hi, can I get a Malibu and pineapple? Bartender: Sure. (soft music) Matt: Moana, I'm sorry about Eva and the shows. I've tried talking to her, but she has made up her mind. Moana: I'm sure this will help. Matt: And I'm sorry about the feedback session, with not supporting you. But you made the choice impossible. Moana: I make the choice impossible? Matt: Yeah, you were all hung up. Moana: She hung me up! She made the choice impossible. Matt: OK. Moana: Are you going to take a seat? Thanks. Matt: Maybe? Moana: So do you try and seduce all the [unintelligible] Matt: Yes, it is standard practice. But I honestly like you. Matt: Is that what I'm doing? Seducing you? Moana: You're not doing a very good job. Matt: Well I'm sorry. If you apologize one more time, I'm likely to throw this drink in your face. Matt: Moana, we can't have a relationship we're not initiating in a group. I like you a lot, but we can't kiss or make love, so lets not get too horny OK? Moana: What? Matt: It's health reasons. Moana: What reasons? Matt: I told you there is a quarantine period before anyone can join. Moana: Why have you been coming on to me if you can't have a relationship? Matt: We can. But not while you're not initiated. Moana: You can't have relationships outside the group? Matt: There is another way. Moana: What is it? Matt: We could partner one another in a love dream. Moana: How does it work? Matt: Well we imprint on one another's terminals, which enables a virtual image to be created. Moana: Do we do it together or separately? Matt: Seperately. Technically it is possible to participate in the same dream. But Star forbid it. Moana: Stop sucking whipped cream. Come dance! (high tech music) Moana: Is it too late come now? Matt: It's a perfect time. (sensual jazz) Moana: How does it work? Matt: We both touch a screen to signal our consent. Eva: What are you doing here? Moana: I stayed over. Eva: Dreaming? Good idea, that's the spirit. Moana: I want my phone. Eva: Haven't you got it? Moana: I can't believe you are wimping out on our music after all our work. Eva: I'm not wimping out. I'm just not prepared to bury myself in this shit. Moana: Angel's gotten us where we are. Eva: Yeah by doing the shit gigs. Moana: She's gotten us into the awards. And now you are messing it all up. Eva: I want to do the awards. I just want to win them. Moana: We all want to win them. Eva: Do you? Moana: Yes. That's why I'm here trying to rescue you from your delusions. Eva: How far are you prepared to go? We're going to fight it. Eva: Don't be stupid, that's our future. We've got to take this to the next level. Moana: And how many successful bands has she managed? Brunette: Two announcements to make this morning everyone. Firstly, it's nearly time for our check up period again. So when you register to get your STI check, please remember to register from a different address so they don't know we all live together. The second announcement this morning is that the probe is on track to fly past Pluto, 9 PM Sidney time. We are going to celebrate here at eight. Eva: You should come along tonight. I'm doing some performing. Moana: Already feels like I live here. Star: Good morning everybody. I have some news of my own to share this morning. We had a new sex-swap paring last night. Apparently our trusted Matt has hit on one of the newcomers. Would you like to share that with us, please? Matt: I always fin these situations a little bit embarrassing. But the fact of the matter is that Moana and I have a particular relationship that I value very much. Of course I have asked her to join the group, but, in the meantime, we consumated our bond last night in virtual space. And, for my part, it was very good. Moana: Do they monitor the dreams? Eva: I've been wondering that myself. Star: Apparently Matt's partner is the gallant other half of the famous Butterfly Crush. And she is with us again this morning. Tell us Moana, how did you find our young stallion? Moana: I would prefer him in flesh and blood. Without the etiquette of your particular mating system. Star: Perhaps young Matt didn't satisfy you at all and you just don't want to admit it to him? Moana: I just find it hard to talk about intimate sexual experiences in front of masses of people. Star: That is a very personal and appropriate comment. It is hard for us to share our intimate details with other people. But that is also why it is so important, for us to do so. A big hand for Moana. (loud applause) In fact, for playing along so well, I would like to offer you a free processing session. Eva: That's a one on one with Star. I dare you to. Star: Oh, hi Moana. Moana: Hi. Star: Come and sit down. I'm glad you've come. Moana: Can I have my phone? Star: Yes, you can have your phone. But I just wanted to have a chat with you about your work. Tell me about it. Moana: We are competing in the song awards this weekend. We probably won't win, but if we can keep it together for the next few days and we get a placing... Star: If you can keep it together? Moana: We have promotional commitments to be eligeble. And since Eva has been here, she stopped doing them. We have a talk show gig this afternoon, for example. I was wondering if you could get her to come along? Star: Doesn't she want to go? Moana: She hasn't been very cooperative lately. I just thought you might be able to persuade her. Star: I couldn't do that. Moana: Why not? Star: Well, I can't be seen to manipulate members. It would be down on me like a ton of bricks if I did that. Moana: All I'm asking is for you to support her work. Star: I can't be seen to be pushing one way or another. Moana: But it must be good to have members who are also high profile members of the community? Star: Mmm, it depends. Sometimes too much attention isn't a good thing. A member might be too fresh for such an ambassadorial role. Moana: Can I just have my phone? Star: Of course. And I'm sorry about that. I just had to see what you had on it. Moana: Thanks. Moana: So you got the letter from our lawyer about conning us into signing that management contract? Star: Ah, yes, and I wanted to speak to you about that. I just really, really want to help you guys get ahead. There isn't anything underhand about it at all. Moana: Yet nobody talked to me about changing management and all that hokus pokus. Star: Didn't Eva discuss it with you? Oh I'm sorry. Moana: You want all of our money! Star: Money? It just weighs us down. One of the great things about living here, is that all your financial details are taken care of. And you can focus on all the important things, like our own personal development. What is this fixation with material success? Moana: I don't know. Star: Perhaps you are not letting things take their natural course. Moana: I left home when I was 18. And I lived on the streets for two years doing street theater. Star: Why? Moana: Because my dad died and my mother went crazy. (sighs and sobbing) Star: Close your eyes for me. Imagine your father was here in the room, right now with you, in front of you. What would you say to him? Moana: I miss you dad. And I love you. Even though you made it so hard to do that. Star: Tell him why he made it hard for you. Moana: You made it hard the time I caught you spying on me in the shower. That time you took a pass at me when mom was away. I'm sorry I told her but, you know, you can't live a lie. Star: Tell him what you think of him for doing that to you. Tell the bastard what you think of such despicable behavior. Moana: You are a bastard and I hate you! For abusing my faith in you. Just lucky I had the sense to run away. Star: You did well. Star: These things take a lot of time to resolve. You understand that, don't you? Now don't think anymore. Just let your mind go blank. (upbeat music) Bag lady: Give me the can? Can, give me the can. Homeless woman: Spare some change for the homeless? (techno music) Large guard: It's a (mumbling) tonight. (mumbling) Moana: Will this do? Large guard: It's perfect. There you go. Matt: I have to rig the equipment before the flypass. I've only got a few minutes. Eva: Thanks for coming. Moana: Well I feel vulnerable, but I'm here for you. We have come to take you back to the real world. Eva: Real world? The real world is the delusion. Get over it. Moana: The real world is the delusion? Do your hear yourself? Eva: Look Moana, your real world is what is dragging us both down. Let it go. Moana: I told you, you were changing. Eva: Either commit to it or fuck off. Moana: You know what? That's it. You want to know how far I'm prepared to go? You just found out. Star: What exactly is going on here? Matt: Nothing. Moana and Eva just had a fight. Star: Yes, Eva just told me. Matt: So now I'm just... Star: What? Matt: Comforting her. Star: Why? She is a spy. Matt: She is just a little... Star: I don't want her here. Is that phone recording? Do you see what I mean? Moana: Of course, you couldn't be seen to be taking sides. Star: No, but is was Matt that was taking sides this time, wasn't it Matt? Matt: Sorry. Star: We've still got that bed wetting response at some level, haven't we? Stick around. You will see what's possible if you dare to become what you can. Then, I don't want you back here. Ever. (sassy music) Eva: ♫ So, this didn't go well ♫ I fail, oh well, gotta push of the dirt ♫ And put on a new skirt ♫ Shake it off, break it down, ♫ Spread some lovin' all around ♫ Chase the rush, shoot the breeze ♫ Fill the bowl with their money ♫ I wanna fall and I wanna fall far ♫ Moana: I don't feel good. Eva: ♫ Fly like an eagle, roar like a lion ♫ Never giver up, ♫ Moana: I have to go. ♫ Never stop trying ♫ Matt: Are you sure you can't wait a little bit longer? Eva: ♫ Every prom queen's dream ♫ Moana: I'll wait outside. Eva: ♫ Every rock star is fading, ♫ Got to find a new theme ♫ Everybody gets down, stop your crying right now ♫ Hold on to the one you love ♫ And scream ♫ (soft piano music) Moana: Thanks for coming with me tonight. You could come stay the night, then go home in the morning. Matt: You know I can't. Moana: Just for an hour. No one would know. Matt: I would know. Besides, there are too many suitors already. Moana: Are you sure? Matt: It's better this way. See you soon. (phone rings) Angel: Where were you after the talk show gig? Moana: Eva says she wants to stop doing Butterfly Crush. Angel: Stop doing Butterfly Crush? Moana: They sucked her right in. Made her believe that she doesn't need us anymore. Angel: Well we need her! I mean, we need her for the song awards tomorrow. Moana: Star is pulling the strings. I think it's time we called her bluff. We've got nothing to lose now. Angel: Alright. I'll get onto it. (soft guitar music) Blond Journalist: In a sensational development here at the courthouse, the management of one of tomorrow's contestants in the Australasian Song Awards, Butterfly Crush, has just filed a civil suit. Claiming entrapment and psychological manipulation of one of it members, by the cult known as the "Dreamguides", which is based in King's Cross. The Dreamguides are reportedly a cult, engaged in group sex, emotional manipulation, and brainwashing of it's members, under the guise of therapy. (gentle jazz) Moana: We had to do it. Eva: Well it worked. Eva: So what do you have to tell me here that you couldn't tell me there yesterday? Angel: Your application for the awards wasn't submitted. Eva: Fuck you. Angel: I checked. It was due in yesterday. Eva: Well there must be some mistake. Moana: Eva, you're being conned. Eva: Fuck you too. Moana: Well not anymore. Angel: I've already submitted the application for Butterfly Crush. I can take the individual forms in today. I can take yours too. Moana: We can still win this. Eva: At last. I've been waiting for you to say that for so long. (soft knock) Matt: It's my insurance policy. And it may prove useful for your future negotiations over Eva. Moana: Insurance policy? Matt: I know how they work. And I have a lot of files on them that could do them harm. Moana: What is it? Matt: It's an investment file about which the tax department knows nothing. Moana: There is a lot of money here. Why do you need an insurance policy? Matt: I'm moving out. (sensual jazz) Matt: I wanted to do it this afternoon. But I couldn't find the opportunity. Moana: How come we've never talked about this before? Matt: It's... Sort of complicated. Moana: Well, tell me now. Matt: It's just hard, like, if we could do a dream together, then I could show you. Moana: Is that highly forbidden? Matt: Well yeah, but no one would know. Moana: Why is it forbidden? Matt: They say it can encourage deep bonds between the participants. Moana: That's just what we need. (quiet laughter) (high tech music) Moana: I don't know if this is such a good idea. Matt: Don't worry. We are in and out. Everything OK? This is the white session. Just think about this room if you have any questions about what's happening while we're dreaming. Moana: Is this a real room? It's programmed to resemble on of our rooms so that we feel comfortable here. OK, here we go. Star: Good evening. The Pluto encounter, which we will all be witnessing in the next couple of days, is going to be the first chance that we are going to have to see our solar system's binary planet close up. Brunette group member: But what about God? (ridiculing laughter) Star: Do I come over to your place and disturb your evening? Matt: Eva's friend played right into your hand tonight. Star: Well I always think it's good to demonstrate a clear authority. Brunette: That crazy woman has been here three times now. Star: But I have a feeling she won't be returning. (approving laughter) Matt: Well I'm glad. Matt: She is simply demonstarting that she is stronger than you. That whatever individual freedom you have, it's only at her discretion. Moana: I see. Matt: Do you want to go on? Moana: I want to know why you are moving out. Matt: Eva's friend had right into your hands tonight. Star: Well I always think it's good to demonstrate a clear authority. Brunette: That crazy woman has been here three times now. Star: I know, and that's why I'm so hard on her. But I do have a feeling that she won't be returning. Matt: Well I'm glad. Star: Moving on. We really need to break Eva's bond with this person. Or bring her into the group. Now you appear to be making some progress with her Matt? Matt: Oh well, she is becoming hot for me. Star: Well just so long as you don't become hot for her. Star: We also need to be aware that Eva has a tendency to form these types of friendships. We can see from her chart with her soft underbelly. So we need to really make sure that she bonds with us, and not outsiders. Matt: Is there any Pluto activity coming up? Star: There is. So I thought if we hold an intensive feedback session in about a month, we should be able to establish some new patterns that make it healthier for her to stay in the group. Moana: Fuck! Matt: Just relax, you are disrupting the virtual construct. Would I be telling you this if it wasn't true? Moana: Maybe it's worth simulating on. Star: That girl Eva had her first feedback session today. We really need to watch the contact she has with the other member of the duo. The one that wants to champion the weak. I have been encouraging Eva to go solo with her career. And it is likely that she will be a good earner. As you know we are in bad need of resources for our country retreat in the Indian Mountains. Red headed member: She sounds very attracted to that friend. Star: Yes but we did have a breakthrough in our feedback. We noticed there were some Pluto activity in her chart, so we chose to confront the issue. And you can see how it went today. Eva: If you don't want to be here then you better go. (applause) Star: I am very disappointed in you. Very, very disappointed. Matt: That's OK. I got very disappointed in you a long time ago. Star: The newcomer can go. And I want him in my office in five minutes. Moana: You don't have to stay. We are going together. Matt: It's OK. Remember I've got my insurance policy. (intense music) (hard knock) (heavy sigh) This is a file of investment data controlled by the Dreamguide's leader. Matt swears that she will do anything to stop this from being revealed. Angel: Tell me what happened. How could you be so stupid? I've got little green men chasing me with guns. I don't need you hassling me right now. I just keep thinking of Matt trapped in there. And Eva. Angel: This is hot. All we need to do is threaten to send this to the media and give them a deadline. Circular Quay, in an hour. I need you to do something for me, if you are up for it. I've arranged for you to meet your boyfriend. Get a written commitment from them. Moana: Did they hurt you? Matt: This is just from the sun. Moana: Are they here to stop you from running away? Matt: They have me grounded. Moana: Huh? Matt: Confined to my room. No outside contact. Moana: But you are here. Matt: Well you pressured them to bend the rules a bit. Moana: [unintelligible] run away, they wouldn't catch us. Matt: Too risky. I'll plan on making it to the awards tonight. Moana: How is Eva? She OK? Matt: More than OK. She has been honored by the group for participating in the awards. Moana: I want you to come along. Matt: Maybe I can. If you request it. Star: Good luck, newcomer. Moana: Why are you so happy? Eva: Well we are here, aren't we? This is everything that I wanted. Moana: Don't you see what's happening? Don't you see how you are being manipulated by them? Eva: Yeah I do see it. But I figure as long as I am enjoying myself. Moana: While they are sabotaging your career. Eva: It's all a misunderstanding. She simply forgot to submit it. Moana: I think you should check with Matt. He's been locked in his room since yesterday. Eva: I haven't seen him around. Moana: They caught us doing a dream together and Matt was just showing me how it really works. An alarm went of and they arrived with guns. They are after your money and she has been trying to separate us so you can have this solo career. It's been her deliberate strategy. Eva: She has been pushing this solo idea. (amused laughter) Moana: AS if. Eva: I could do it! Star: I hear you can't get enough of one another anymore. (cheering drowns out Star) Eva: It's always been about the music. We wouldn't be here otherwise. Star: Sure. ("I Know Who I Am" playing) Eva: ♫ This song, ♫ Asleep in my heart ♫ Has finally been woke up, I'm back at the start. Moana: ♫ These words, ♫ Are truly my own ♫ Now they can be spoken, ♫ Now that I'm home Eva and Moana: ♫ Because I ♫ Know what it is to be lost, now I ♫ Know what it is to be found, yeah ♫ Though everything that I've sought is all around. ♫ This life is changing on us everyday ♫ Sometimes we all get lost upon our way ♫ Back home, everybody understands ♫ Just who I am, they know who I am, ♫ They know who I am ♫ I'm back to feeling what I used to feel ♫ My past has shown me what is true and real ♫ I'm just a girl who finally understands Moana: ♫ That's who I am Eva: ♫ That's who I am Moana and Eva: ♫ I know who I am ♫ I know who I am Moana:♫ Sometimes ♫ You have to go back ♫ In order to go forward ♫ On the right path Eva: ♫ These eyes ♫ Are open so wide ♫ Now I'm looking onward, to the rest of my life Eva and Moana: ♫ Because I ♫ Know what it is to be lost, now I ♫ know what it is to be found, yeah ♫ Though everything that I've sought is all around ♫ This life is changing on us everyday ♫ Sometimes we all get lost upon our way ♫ Back home, everybody understands ♫ Just who I am, they know who I am ♫ They know who I am. ♫ I'm back to feeling what I used to feel. ♫ My past has shown me what is true and real. ♫ I'm just a girl who finally understands Moana: ♫ That's who I am.

He's with us. Moana: We did it! Matt: You did great! Matt: I'm moving out. Eva: Moving out? Matt: Look, it's all bullshit games. She deliberately didn't send in your registration. She doesn't want you to get too succesfull until you are stable in the group. So she thought next year would be fine. Eva: Bitch! Moana: Hey guys, so this is what it is like waiting back stage for the winner to be announced. And you're catching it live tonight. Announcer: And the winner is Butterfly Crush! (excited screaming) (wild applause) (excited whistle) (enthusiastic clapping) (champagne popping) (pop music) Moana: To Butterfly Crush. Eva, Matt and Angel: To Butterfly Crush. (pop music)
