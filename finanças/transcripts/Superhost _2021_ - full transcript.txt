We can just throw in some reactions over the boring parts. Yeah. Claire: Hey, can you order a hard drive to the house? Yeah, I can. Claire: I think I'm gonna shower before we go. - Sounds good. - Hey. - You want to join me? - Really? Nah. [Laughs] [Water running] Hey, babe! [Click] What's up, guys? Okay.

First impressions. Babe, give me a heads up. Still got road hair. Claire: Come on. Think fast. First impressions. [ Exhales sharply] Okay. Wah! Come on, DiCaprio. Okay. Uh, my first impressions of this place is just the - okay. Cut the shit. What? That felt fake. Do it over. Teddy: Okay. Fine. [ Exhales sharply] Okay. Do you want to start off with the shot of the house? Claire: Mm-hmm. Got it. What are you doing? Holy crap! This is insane! Oh, my gooood! You're the worst. [ Gasps ] And scene. [Chuckling] This is why we're losing subscribers. Ouch. [ Chuckles ] Got a pretty good feeling about this video. [Chuckles] Mm-hmm. Teddy: Could be on a hot streak again soon. Claire: Whew. Let's hope so. Teddy: Place looks so nice. - [ Hinges creak] - All right. 2342. [ Beeping ] 42. - [ Beeping ] - Shit. - Not working? - No. Here. "First arrive..." Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah. Front door code... 2342. - Yeah, I tried that. - Well, shit. - That's what I said. - Do you have the host's number? - Can you call them? - Yeah, it's in our messages, but it's not loading. - No. Look. It's right here. - Oh. Let me get a better signal. [Keypad dialing] It's ringing! [Line ringing ] It's ringing. [ Click, dial tone ] It's not ringing anymore! Claire: Here we go. Second impressions. Second impressions. Yeah. Well, the outside is terrific, but we got the wrong door code, so I don't know if we'll ever see the inside. Claire: Good energy, but just give me something we can use. Yeah. Uh... Okay. Got something. My second impressions. Claire: What? Teddy, what? - [ Gasps ] - Hi, there! Thanks for the warning. You must be bettylou52. It's actually Rebecca. Teddy: Oh, so you're neither Betty nor Lou. - I'm Claire. - Yeah! I never know what to use on those sites, you know? Do I use my real name and invite strangers to know too much about me, or do I use something random? - Uh, we tried calling. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. The service out here is spotty. I got a notification on the camera, saw you guys sitting out here. Yeah, well, the door code didn't work, so... Oh, pbht! I totally forgot! I had to change it after the last guests tried to stay longer than they were supposed to. Right. [Chuckles] I mean, who can blame them? [Laughs] Ahh! Anyway, I can let you guys in, give you a new code. - Yeah. Thanks. - Sure. - Oh. Thank you. - [ Giggles] [ Muttering ] Rebecca: I'm sorry again about the code. I don't normally have to change it after people. Thanks for understanding. Those last guests, let me tell you. New code is 8587. Teddy: 8587. - [ Alarm beeping ] - Thanks. [ Keypad beeping, alarm stops ] Wow. Ditto. The alarm code is the same as the front door. Do you need me to write it down? 8587. Got it. Restroom? Down there to the right. Claire: Oh, my god. We are here. And it is gorgeous. Say hello to the superhost. Ii had messaged you when we booked about what we do. We do that travel vlog called "superhost" where we stay at and review vacation rentals. Ohh! Tht! Of course! Sorry. It's been such a busy season. I thought you were next week. I-If you don't mind, of course. We've never had any problems with it before, so... No. No, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah. And you're still okay with being on camera for it? Yeah! [Giggles] For sure. Whatever you need. I just want to make sure this trip is unforgettable. Hey, so, the, uh, toilet over there isn't flushing. Oh. That's weird. Um, I am really sorry. I can come back later with some tools. I don't have anything on me. Oh. Yeah. That's totally fine. I'm just glad it was just a number one. [ Chuckles ] [Laughing] Hmm. Well, I don't want to get in the way of your trip. Wouldn't want to get a bad review! I'll come back tomorrow to fix the toilet. If there is anything you need before then, shoot me a text. Will do. [ Door closes ] She sure is something. [ Chuckles] Yeah. What's up, guys?! We finally settled in. And we want to give you a quick tour around this place. This room is beautiful. It was featured the most on the site for good reason. - Look how big these windows are! - [ Boing! Boing! ] [Slide whistle! ] And welcome to the very rustic kitchen. - Check out this little number. - An authentic cabin stove! Looks a bit like a "hansel and gretel" situation. Like, maybe you could fit in there, Teddy. I would cook me in here. - Oh, it's very filthy, though. - Yes, it is. And here we have the master bedroom. With exactly zero window covering! Seems like we'll be getting up very early in the morning, which I love, as you guys know. -[ Zapping I -ooh. How is it? - Very soft. - Great. And what vacation rental would be complete without... - One of these? - Ooh! - I gotta see it. - [ Gasps ] No, Teddy. I have to! Tell my parents I love them! - No, Teddy! No! - Okay. It was close. So, one thing we noticed. - Security cameras everywhere. - I mean, places like this usually have a security camera or two, but it just seems a little bit overboard here. - Another one. - [ Whoosh ] Another one there. And what do we have here, Teddy? We have my favorite room in the house. A cat room! With everything that you need as a cat! He's so strange. But I haven't seen a cat yet. Have you? [ Explosion, cat meows] - Claire: Teddy. - [ Keyboard clacks ] What? You like cats. Okay. Apart from that, what do you think? It feels slow. Really? W-Which part? Claire: Every part. Oh, come on. It's not that bad. Babe. Just lose the cat room bit and upload it. [Claire sighs] [Door slides] Teddy: It's uploading. And the Internet is very slow. [ Chuckles ] Mm-hmm. Hey, I know how hard you've been working on this channel. [Sighs] Teddy: But we're gonna have a great series here. - I know it. - Our numbers are dropping. What if we've peaked? And that's it? Then... At least we've peaked together. [Laughs] Yeah. You're so corny. Teddy: I know. [ Beeping ] [Wind chime ringing softly] - Hey. - Jesus. Babe. What are you doing, sneaking up on me like that? Claire: I called your name from the stairs. What are you doing? I thought I saw something out there. What? Where? Out there. It looked like they were staring back at me. Maybe you just saw an animal or something. Teddy, it's 3:00 in the morning. Let's go back to bed. We have a lot to do tomorrow. What's up, guys? Day two of our trip here! Claire is still sleeping. Let's go say hi. - [ Groans] - Good morning, sunshine. No. Good night. Aww. We've missed you. I've missed you. Claire: No, you haven't. We had a bit of a late night, but we're ready for day-two adventures! So don't forget to smash that "like" button and subscribe to our videos. Anything to add, Claire? Why is it so bright in here?! [ Chuckles ] Too early, dude. I know. [ Phone unlocks] Shit. - What? - Shit! - What? - Check your phone. Wait. How did this happen? I bet it was "that bitch in draper." I mean, it could have been a bot auto-flagging or something. We... we can dispute it. It's not a mistake! - Does it say which video? - The whole channel's down. Of course. No service. [ Groans] Gotcha. [Line ringing ] Man: Hello. You've reached the partnership program support line. - [ Keypad beeps] - Please wait while we connect you to the next available agent. Hi! How ya doin'? Hey! Yeah, i-I'm good. Just here to fix the toilet. [Laughs] Oh. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Is the place treating you well, like, outside of that? I would really... hate to get a bad review. [Laughs] Oh. Yeah, yeah. It's great. I'm actually just trying to make a call, but Teddy's upstairs. Perfect. [Giggles] I'll check it out. Okay. [Muzak playing, click] Brad: Hello. My name is Brad, and thanks for holding. Can I get your account number, please? What's up, guys? Teddy here. It is day two, and I only have a couple of minutes, but I wanted to quickly give you an update on the proposal. The current plan is, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna take her to this super pretty spot that one of our fans sent us... Thank you so much... And do the deed. And don't worry... I'm gonna film the whole thing secretly the entire time so you can all enjoy. [ Knock on door] All right. Gotta run. Ciao. [ Knock on door] - Hey, Teddy! - Oh. Hey. I really should have checked before I used it. It happens. We get issues with the septic tank from time to time. Don't have the pressure you guys have. [Grunts] It's usually nothing. But sometimes things get stuck in here. It's this low season right now, so sometimes these things don't get the use to keep them working properly. [Grunts] [Grunting] [ Groans] Shit. I'm gonna have to get somebody out here. That's fine. We'll just use the other one. I really hope this doesn't affect your review. Oh, no. Believe me, this place is great. You have nothing to worry about. Hey. How did it go? I spent all that time verifying the account information, and then, I dropped the call. Gosh, I kind of like this place can't win right now. Teddy: No, you have nothing to do with it. Rebecca: Are you sure? [Voices fading] [Ominous background noise] Rebecca: If there's anything I can do, please don't hesitate. And again, I am so sorry. Thank you. [Ominous background noise] What you want to do now? What are we doing up here? We make these stupid videos that nobody's even watching anymore. - People are watching. - We're bleeding subscribers. What's the point? I... like making these with you. Do you like asking your parents for help to pay rent? - They don't mind. - That's not the point. We used to be able to... Pay our own bills. We've gotten away from what worked for us. "The bitch from draper" was massive. Yeah, but that was so click-baity. No one likes that. It got eyeballs. I guess. We should get back. [Sighs] Claire: What? Teddy, what? Rebecca: Hi, there. Teddy: My second impression. Claire: What? Teddy, what? Teddy: My second impression. Claire: What? Teddy, what? Teddy: My second impression. Hey, I'm gonna head up. Okay. I'll be up in a minute. Okay. Claire: Teddy, what? [ Clattering ] [ Clattering ] Teddy: Did you hear that? - What time is it? - Shh. It was nothing. Just go back to sleep. [ Clattering ] Someone's inside the house. What do you mean someone's ins- [ clattering ] What do we do? I don't know. What if it's Rebecca? What if it's not? I'm calling the police. Shit. No service. Did you set the alarm? Yeah. Go check. What? Claire: Just go make sure. Are you serious? Claire: Check the living room. Hello? [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Indistinct talking] Hello? [Water bubbling] Well? Toilet's fixed. [Birds chirping] - Good morning. - Jesus! Sorry. I was hoping to be done before you got up. I know. I know. I just couldn't sleep last night, because I kept thinking about how things kept going wrong for you guys, and I didn't want another day to get off on the wrong foot. So, I stopped at the store, and I ended up getting a few other things, and then one thing led to another. Yeah, I... I totally get it. I'm just about done, and then, I'll be out of your hair. Won't happen again. Okay. [Coffee bubbling] Coffee's almost ready. What's up? Rebecca made us breakfast. What did she make? Claire: How do you not smell the food. Teddy: You don't go downstairs thinking that you're gonna... You know, someone's gonna... I don't know. I thought it was a candle. Claire: When did she come in? Teddy: I don't... I don't know. I just came down, half naked. [Laughs] It was humiliating. I'm just glad I was wearing underwear. It's amazing. No, it was terrible, is what that was. Well, even though she gave you a fright, she made us some damn good pancakes. Yeah. Hey, thanks for breakfast. - [ Chime ] - You are so welcome. [ Mouths "what?" ] Claire: Okay, I am speeding. Okay, so, not gonna lie, so far, this trip has been pretty interesting. It's been a doozy. First of all, our channel got de-monetized. - By accident. Not our fault. - Right. But then, you think you come out this far to get away from all those crazy people, but then, you get to this house, and you realize that the host might actually be crazier than the people you were escaping in the... - Babe. - What? I mean, we shouldn't talk about the... What do you mean? I think she can hear us. Can't we just turn it off? Probably. But let's just film some place else. This room looks the best. Yeah, it does. Okay. Let me find a ladder. Okay. I'm gonna cut. Careful. [ Loud thud, Claire gasps] It was you. You reported us, didn't you? You ruined everything. Ruined what? Ever since you came out with your bullshit video. Jesus. What's wrong with you? No one will stay there. I have to sell the place. Claire: Oh, so, what's your plan? You drive three hours to, what, beat me up? Teddy: Claire, don't. Let's just calm down and talk about this. What is going on here? Who are you? Are you the owner? I said, "who are you?" You better watch out for these two. They're snakes. They'll make up a bunch of lies about you and ruin your life. Look at what she did to your house. Did you do that? I couldn't help it. I saw them up there, and I... These two, they came into my home, and they destroyed my entire business. So, you came here and broke my window. I know. I'm sorry about that. I really am. But... You don't understand. I understand just fine. And if you don't leave now, I'm calling the police. These people are not who they say they are. You better watch. Get off my property! Geez. Alright. I'm going. Don't say I didn't warn you. Go! Now! Or I swear to god, I will cut you open! [ Car door closes] [Car departs] Well, then. That was something. [Laughs] You're... Kind of a badass. Oh. No. I just hate what a mess this trip has been for you guys. I can't even begin to imagine what your video is gonna be like. Believe me, we're having a great time. Yeah. Her place was a total shit hole, and she was a complete psychopath. Yeah. Look, I came down to say I have some time now, and I'd like to do that interview. Really? Yeah. Sure. Why not? Okay. I can't believe we didn't have the camera with us. Sound good? Sounds great. I've never done this before, so it might not be very good. No, this is gonna be super easy. And we're not live, so, if you flub a line, just stop. We'll go back. Hey, this is gonna be fun. Let's roll the camera. Claire: Speeding. [ Screams ] Do I look at you, or at the camera? Just look at me. I'm not even here. - Look at you. - Yeah. Got it. Alright, Rebecca, we're gonna start off with a friendly introduction, sort of like a, "hi, my name is Rebecca, and I'm a superhost." If you could say something like that that'd be great. Hi. My name is Rebecca, and I'm a superhost. Teddy: Awesome. And that smile at the end was perfect. Okay, so, we're gonna get into the real questions now. And I'm not on camera. You can't hear or see me. If you can incorporate the question into the answers. Let's say I'm asking you, "what color is your shirt?" Instead of saying "red," you would say, "the color of my shirt is red." - Make sense? - But my shirt is white. Yeah. So, then, you would say, "the color of my shirt is white." Right? Yeah. I think so. Teddy: Okay. Let's... let's get going. So, Rebecca, how did you decide to get into renting out your house? For starters, this isn't really my house. My father left it to me when he died. He owned it with my step-mom, and when he passed, she got his house in south Carolina, and I got this one. Oh, wow. I'm... So sorry to hear that. But it must be nice to have a place like this to remember him by. Yeah, it's great. I have a smaller place not far from here... Much smaller... So I'm able to keep an eye on it. But... it felt wrong to keep it empty. So, when all of these vacation home sharing websites started popping up, I signed up. Here we are. Teddy: That's great. Any particular experiences with the rental that you'd like to share? You know, maybe someone that has stayed, and left a memorable impression on you? Yeah. You know what? There was this one. An older couple. They rented the place for an entire month over Christmas. They saw that I was living alone, and all of their kids had kids and did their own thing for the holidays. So, they invited me in. And we spent the holidays together. Christmas, new year's, I was here with them. It was nice. It was like I was their family. Re... re... It is the best holiday I ever had. They live back in south Carolina, but are just... The nicest people. I think... I think that's great. Awesome job. Oh, if we could get one final line. Of course. Yeah, this is just a signoff. If you can say, "hi, my name is Rebecca," pause, and then, with the most enthusiasm that you can, finish it off with, you know, "I am a superhost. Hi. My name is Rebecca. And I am a superhost! Hi. My name is Rebecca. And I am a superhost! That is the craziest shit I've ever seen. I knew when we got here. Teddy: What do you mean? This is what people want to see. They want to see people like that... complete lunatics. [Sighs] We got to get more of her. This chick is gold. Let's watch it again. Rebecca: Hi. My name is Rebecca. And I am a superhost! What's up, guys. Claire's sleeping right now, and we have a brand-new episode that's slowly uploading. But I wanted to record a quick update on the super top secret proposal video. Also, you should hit that "like" button. Don't forget to subscribe. So, in the morning, I'm gonna take her up the hill. And the view is supposed to be spectacular. That's where I'm gonna do it. I thought I heard her. Anyway, just wanted to give you a quick update. I can't wait to see her face when she finds out why we really came out here. I should get going. She's a light sleeper. But I'll see you guys tomorrow. [Chimes ringing] So, Teddy thought it would be a great idea to wake up bright and early to go walking in the middle of nowhere. To make matters worse, our upload didn't work last night. It seems the Internet is down, so who knows if you'll ever see it. Yes, but I did write to Rebecca this morning, and it should be fixed by the time we get back. Yeah, we'll see about that. Speaking of Rebecca, I don't think I have ever seen anything as crazy as what we witnessed yesterday. We're gonna have to shoot some kind of reenactment for you, but basically, she nearly beat the crap out of that bitch Vera. Remember her? Yeah, well, she drove all the way here, shows up out of nowhere, all huffing and puffing. - Come on. Let's do this after. - One second. That's right... The bitch from draper came here, and threw a rock at a window. I mean, we went out there, and she legit wanted to fight me. - Claire. - And then, Rebecca, this host, comes out of nowhere, goes fully crazy, and that bitch just hightails it out of here. Claire, come on. Fine. Party pooper. [ Breathing heavily] [Sighs] - Wow. - Yeah. Okay. Check out this view we have here. This is unbelievable. Teddy: Hey, can we just... Stop for a moment? Here. Why don't you want to film? I do. Claire: What are you doing? Teddy: I just... I just want to look at you for a moment. What? I know how stressed you've been lately, and I just want to take a minute to... Tell you just how much I appreciate you. - Teddy, I... - Just... one moment. So, I've been thinking. That's never good. I've been thinking that you and I have been doing this show for a while now. And we've been together even longer than that. And we do everything together... Everything. And I just want to continue doing everything together... The show... life... Everything. Teddy... Teddy: So, I spoke with your parents last week. You did? Yeah. Your dad told me a long time ago that I had to talk to him before I got any ideas. So I did. I talked to your mom and dad, and I asked them if this was okay. Claire... Will you marry me? Yes! Of course! Teddy, you're a genius. - What do you mean? - A secret proposal? It's perfect. People love this shit. Okay. Ready? Oh, my god! This guy just proposed to me! I've never had such a big surprise in my life! Claire. Claire, stop. What? You're serious? Jesus, Ted. You set the camera up for it. I figured it was... Yeah, I know. That was dumb. No, it's just... did you really talk to my dad? Oh, shit. Teddy! Teddy. Teddy, come on. Let's talk about this. There's nothing to talk about. I'm sorry that I didn't take that seriously, but you have to understand how it looked. Teddy: I thought I did. I'm sorry. It's just not something that I was expecting to happen on this trip. And I've been so distracted with everything. And I hate that your parents are helping us right now. Hey, I know that you think I just obsess over clicks, but I'm doing this for us. And I'm sorry if it doesn't seem that way right now, but I promise... When we get home, we'll talk about this. No cameras. Okay. Okay. Teddy: So, what do you want to do now? Claire: I don't know. Can we just have a quiet day together? Teddy: Yeah. That would be nice. [ Chuckles ] At least the hard drive came. [Alarm beeping ] [ Beeping continues] Claire: It's not working. [ Beeping continues] The code's not working. It's 8587, right? Let me try. [ Beeping continues] [Alarm blares] It is 8587. Why isn't it... [ Blaring continues] This makes no sense. [ Blaring continues] [Alarm stops ] - [ Chimes ] - Sorry, guys. The panel isn't working. I'll head over in just a minute to fix it for you. Hope this doesn't affect the review. They rented the place for an entire month of Christmas. Saw that saw that I was living alone. A/I their kids had kids and did their own thing for the holidays. - So, they invited me in. - Claire. We spent the holidays together. - Claire. - Christmas, new year's. - Look. - I was here with them. Teddy: Betty and Lou. Rebecca: It was like I was their family. I think we should go. And she for sure said she made it up? She said she didn't want to use her real name. But, what does that mean? Why would she lie about that? That doesn't make any sense. Do you really want to stick around to find out? Claire: Teddy, we're so close. I can feel it. This video is gonna be great. [ Door closes ] [Chiming] [Chiming] [Chiming] Screw this. That was kind of tense. Yeah. Let's get out of here. I wonder if we can get a refund for our last day. [ Chuckles ] Claire: Oh, no. [Laughs] - Hey. - Hey. - Are you guys leaving? - Yeah. Yeah. We got everything we needed here. You know, got a long drive back, so thought we'd head out a bit early. Oh, great. Well, I hope you enjoyed your stay. We did. It was great. Thank you. I look forward to your review. Yeah, for sure. [ Laughs] - Well... - Oh, I almost forgot. There was one more thing I wanted to show you. Can you get your camera? It'll be quick. I promise. - Like, here? - Yeah. It's just down there. Don't worry. It'll be great. I mean, consider it. I know you have to leave. It's gonna be so good for our video. - Let's do it. - What? We need to get more footage of her. - We already have great stuff. - And we can get more. Look at her. She's harmless. Teddy, this video is gonna be huge. I don't feel good about this. Claire: I know. But if we can get this right, we could afford our own place again. Is the camera ready? Claire: Yeah. We're rolling. How do I look. Lighting good? Sound check? How's that sound? Sorry. I don't really know what that does. I've just seen you guys do it. Claire: Yeah, yeah, it sounds good. Okay. Great. Okay. Ready. [ Screams ] Hey, guys, and welcome to "superhost." Is it okay if I say that? - Sure. - O Kay. Great. Hey, guys, and welcome to "superhost." Teddy: Rebecca... What are we doing here? I'm s o rry? Teddy: Where are you taking us? I see your hand is looking a little light, there, Claire. - What? - Didn't old Teddy bear propose? That's what he was supposed to be doing today. Guess he had a change of heart. No matter. - It's fine. - Eyes over here. Camera. Hey, guys, and welcome to "superhost." We have one final surprise for you that I think you're going to love. This is gonna be the best episode of "superhost" yet. Come on. This way. Teddy: Where did she go? - [ Screams ] - Jesus! [Laughs] [Laughing] I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry. Come on. It's just this way. Oh, I totally forgot. Here. This isn't live, so you can edit this in after. Just wanted to make sure we have it. Don't forget to smash that "like" button, and hit that little bell icon, so you never miss an episode. Come on. - Holy shit. - Ta-da! Look what I found. [ Gasps] Cut her loose. Rebecca: I will. Don't worry. Why aren't you filming this? You're sick. No, you're sick... Taking advantage of this woman like that. Film this. Film this, or I cut her throat. [ Muffled screaming, crying ] Thank you. So, Vera, here, the old bitch from draper, tells me that she lost her income because of your two. Is that true? - Is it?! - I don't... I don't know. That's not what we tried to do with it. Is this true? [ Muffled crying ] So, here's the thing... I hated that everything kept going wrong for you guys. And I was trying my hardest to get you the best video ever. But then, after watching a little more of you two, I realize you're not the perfect duo you pretend to be in your stupid videos. So, when Vera here took her a little revenge trip... Which has horribly backfired... I knew...[ Clicking tongue] We need to capitalize on this. Camera. [Whimpering] I'm sorry. This is really going to hurt. [ Muffled screaming ] [ Screaming ] I know. I know. That hurts a lot. I'm sorry. How was that? What's wrong? Did you get it? Claire, why aren't you filming? Isn't this what you do? This should be great for your show. What's the problem? Ready? -Sorry. One, two, three, up. Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? It was all a joke? It's just a prank, bro. What the hell is wrong with you? - Thank you, Vera. - Ah! [Laughs] Give it to me. Give it. Give it to me. No one's ever gonna see this footage. I want you to delete everything you shot here. I don't actually know how this thing works. Here. Sell it. Make up for some of your lost income. Vera... we're sorry. Fuck you. What happened to Betty and Lou? Who? What did you do to them? God damn it. What is he talking about? I really thought that would work. What's going on? Boy, you weren't kidding about these two. Can't leave well enough alone. I'm sorry about this. About what? You guys, you were so close. Why couldn't you just stop? What am I gonna do with her? Now what am I gonna do? Hello, there. Still works. Go! Go! Go! [ Echoing ] Claire? [Speaking inaudibly] Claire. We have to go. [ Rebecca whistling ] Claire. Claire? I'm sorry. We should get inside. I think the car is that way. [ Panting ] Yeah, but she might be waiting for us. Okay, okay, okay. [ Keypad beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Panting ] Do you think she'll come back here? Yeah. Give me your phone. Where are you going? Don't let anyone open this but me. - Teddy... - Don't worry. Your dad told me he'd kill me if anything happened to you. Oh, where are you? [ Branch snaps] [Snapping continues] [Pounding on door] What happened? I thought I heard her. [ Panting ] I'm not a hero. I'm a... I'm a vlogger. [Alarm blaring ] Okay. Okay. [Alarm stops ] No, no, no. Come on. [Alarm blaring ] [Alarm stops ] What?

[ Tone plays ] Rebecca: Hey, Teddy. What are you doing? Rebecca: Silent treatment, eh? Alright, that's fine. I get it. Say, Ted, you want to know what happened to Betty and Lou? I really did love those two, but they... they wouldn't let me stay. I told them I would do anything, that / couldn't leave this place, it was my home. But they just wouldn't listen. They left me no choice. Betty and Lou and their little cat, too. Look, I'm gonna be honest. You two aren't making it out of here alive. Okay. Okay. [ Exhales sharply] If anyone is out there watching, please, please help us. Rebecca: I was almost out the door when Lou just got angry at me. He got hysterical. I don't know what happened after that. It's all kind of a blur, but [ Chuckles ] I'll tell you what, Teddy, I just kind of..Snapped. This woman, Rebecca, said that she was the host of this place, but she's not. She's a... she's a... She's a murderer. Rebecca: And do you know what happened? I had to clean up. And the funniest part of it all? [ Giggles ] Their stupid cat put up more of a fight than they did. [Laughs] Claire: I don't know how much time we have left, so please just call... Call the police, call someone. We... we need help. [ Panting ] Come on, please, please, please. Rebecca: And when it was over, just when I was almost cleaned up and everything was right again, just when I thought I could get out of here soot-free... You guys came. [ Gasps] Hi, Claire.
