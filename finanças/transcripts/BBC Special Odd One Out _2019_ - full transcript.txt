This programme contains some strong language and some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. Right, guys, we're shooting now. You put him back in the car, did you, Jan? No. My mum is terrified about me making this documentary. She cried the other day. Mum? Oh, you've got him. My mum is so protective. Oscar? Come on, boy. Come on, then. I think that it terrifies her, knowing that I could go back to the person I used to be five years ago. In 2011, I was on X Factor. I was put into a girl group called Little Mix and we were all told that we had to have social media. And it completely changed my life. The whole world had an opinion on me and they weren't good ones. From the minute them comments started, it became the worst time of my life. I wasn't known as just one of the singers in Little Mix. I was known as the fat ugly one. It literally consumed every part of me. Oh, this is a joke! I hate costumes! Look at this. Excess material. Then, look - everyone's going to think I've got rolls, and it's not rolls, it's just extra material. Nobody's going to think you've got rolls. Yes, it is, look! I hit such a low point in my life that I just stopped turning up for work. Little Mix's Jesy Nelson had to cancel at the very last minute. One user wrote, quote, "Kill your BLEEP self." What they said to me still affects me now. I just looked shit and uncomfortable. This is something I've wanted since being a little girl until these bullies did what they did. It doesn't matter whether you're in the public eye or not, you cannot get away from social media, and it's ruining a lot of people's lives. And the comments, people were telling me to, like, kill myself. We all need to talk more about how this is really making us feel. Where's my Jessica? Come 'ere! Come 'ere! Oh! Upsy daisy! As a kid, I just always wanted to be in front of the camera. I just loved entertaining people. And so, it sounds bad, but when I was at school there was no other way for me. I didn't... There was no fall-back. It was either I perform or... ..I guess I'll be skint for the rest of me life! # Running in and out my life...# I've always been obsessed with X Factor. Like, I just love it. So, when I was a barmaid, I constantly used to watch it in the bar and just think, "I know I can win that." And I genuinely believe that if you can envision something, you can make it happen. Will we go for a little walk? Come on, then. Oh, God. He's off already! Come on, Oscar. Being in Little Mix is just the best thing that's ever, ever happened to me. This is my... ..my awards and my achievements. If I am having a down day, I do like to just casually pop up here and look at what I've achieved. This is probably one of my favourites, you know, out of all the awards that we have. This isn't an award. This is like a little memorabilia of when we did One Love Manchester. As much as like, a horrific incident had happened, everyone was in such good spirits and I think that's when you feel incredibly lucky to be in this industry, cos you really see how much your music affects people. Cos sometimes I forget that I am in a girl band who's done, like, quite well. And then when I come up here I'm like, "I've done quite good for myself!" A girl who come from Dagenham who was a barmaid. Yeah. Jess is in the middle, then there's her elder sister, Jade, elder brother Johnny, and then a younger brother, Joe. I've more or less brought them up myself since they were younger. I split with their dad. I remember we moved away and we rented a house. I bought mattresses - we just slept on mattresses. Couldn't afford a fridge, so I put, used to put the milk out in the garden. Get some ice and put it out in the garden. It was like that for a long time. I remember being at a till, and you know one of them annoying people, and I know I was that person, I'd get it and not add it up properly and then it'd come too much and I'd be, oh, put that back, and you'd see people in the queue tutting at you, weren't they? But that's how it was, you know? I found it hard to get out of that habit as well. I'm still quite tight now. Mummy! Hello, darling. Are you all right? Are you OK? Yeah. Are you OK, Momma? Yeah, are you? Yeah, good, thank you. Will I take my shoes off? Yeah. Jesy lives nearby, so that's... All my kids live nearby, really. So, I see her as much as I can. A bit too much, probably. I'm a bit of an over-protective mum, really, I think, especially where Jesy's concerned, cos of what's happened in the past. Erm... I can't let go, really. I know I should! Did you get any old photos? Oh, yeah. I'll get them out. Did you? From when? How old? Oh, when you were a baby! JESY LAUGHS Oh, my God, I look like a cabbage patch doll! Why is my head so big and round?! JESY'S MUM LAUGHS I mean, my attire wasn't helping. These - you look your most stunning. THEY BOTH LAUGH I just always wanted to make people laugh, didn't I? I know. I'd make you take me to this joke shop, where I could just buy all the weirdest things to make people laugh, and I'd just walk around with these teeth in all the time! It was such a strange child! But, look, how innocent. You're all sweet and innocent here, look. If my mum could, she would have me go back to looking like this. Of course I would. Yeah. Look. Sometimes I want to tell you for your own sake, I think, her make-up, it's just too much, like, your eyelashes are too long and you don't need to do all that. You just don't need to do it, cos natural is the best. But I'm also a woman now and I enjoy make-up, I like it. Most girls like make-up, Mum, and like, and like doing themselves up. I enjoy that. I wish you could see the way I see you with no make-up on, cos I just think you look lovely. Cos I always say, I just wish it was back to normal and we could have life back as it was! And have my little, little...funny little Jess back. Oh, I am so proud. And when I watch her on stage, I still get excited, you know? I'm laddish, cheering in the crowd! And, erm, yeah, but as much as I love all that, and people will like, people must think, "How can you say that?" If I could have back my Jess as she was before, I'd change it like that. Yeah. Not have the X Factor, not have any of that. Cos I miss HER. I just feel like I've kind of lost Jess to social media. And they're, like, just addicted to what people are saying. As a kid I was very, very confident. I never had any issues with the way I looked, with my weight. Until everything changed. The winner of The X Factor 2011... CROWD CHEERS ..is... ..Little Mix! The night we won X Factor, everyone was just literally on cloud nine, and I remember going back to the hotel room with Leigh-Anne. And I remember, I think I had about 101 inbox messages on my Facebook, and I remember clicking on it. And the first one that come up was from, I don't know who it was, some random man, and he was like, "You are the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life. "You do not deserve to be in this girl band. "How on Earth were you ever put in this girl band? You deserve to die." And I remember thinking... "..how, how have I just won The X Factor, "and all I want to do is go home and just go back to being a barmaid?" I just wanted to just go back to my normal life. And I just was like, "There's nothing I do about this now, I'm in it." Let's go, jab. Two, four... Good. Nice. Double jab. From the minute them comments started, it just got worse and worse and it just spiralled out of control. I've never looked at myself and thought that I was abnormal looking. And that's how I was made to feel. I'm her big sister, so it hurt, obviously, seeing her so hurt. When the bullying was really bad, she became very withdrawn, couldn't really have much conversation with her. And normally, she'd be, like, the chattiest person in the world. It just wasn't nice to see. Back then, I used to read these, and just cry myself to sleep. "Bless Jesy, #LittleMix. "She's trying to look like the rest. Well, stop. "You're fat, and you look like a chipmunk." "Jesy is getting fatter each week." "Jesy has lost a lot of weight." "They probably could have made a fifth member with everything "that has been sucked out of her." "She's been at the pick and mix." "Little Mix, four members, five chins." "Fat people should not wear tight leggings, "just look at Jesy from Little Mix." "The fat one from Little Mix looks like Miss Piggy from The Muppets." "I just worked out, if you shaved Jesy's head from Little Mix, "she looks exactly like ET." From the minute I won X Factor, I was a different girl. I wasn't Jesy, the barmaid, like, the happy, confident girl that I used to be, I was this vulnerable... ..nervous wreck the whole time. The shit is that I could not change my mind-set. I couldn't make myself happy. When we do interviews, everyone says, "Oh, do you ever watch your..." Oh! Everyone says, "Do you ever watch old videos back of you "when you were on X Factor?" And I can't. Like, I actually, like, can't watch them back, because it just makes me so sad, and it's the time of my life that I will never get back. My brain started to believe everything that people were saying about me. She said, "People send pictures of, like, my body "and put a monster's head on the body." She said, "And now," she said, "I look in the mirror, "and I don't see me any more. "I just see, like, I literally see, like, a monster looking back at me." She said, "And everyone says that, so I must look like that." I felt embarrassed. I felt ashamed. It got so bad, to the point where I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed in the morning, and I just stopped turning up for work. Jesy! We miss her! I remember getting pulled into an office by someone I worked with at the time, and they said, "This can't continue. I think you need to go on antidepressants." And I remember thinking, "Why should I go on antidepressants "because of what people are saying about me?" SONG: Bounce Back # Steady, are you ready? # Are you ready? # What's going on? # What's going on? # Tell me what you know about me # Welcome to the city where it's sweet # You know I'll be taking Vita-D... # We are here because we are going to record our brand-new single. Yeah! They're excited. # However do you want me? # However do you need me? # However do you want me? # Bring the bounce back, bring the, bring the bounce back # However do you need me? # Bring the bounce back, bring the, bring the bounce back... # Whoo! Yay! It's on point. Yay! It's on point. Are you crazy? When I'm listening to it, I'm like, "I know I can do better than that." What?! You're perfect on that. Like, that record is a vibe. OK. 100%. Mm-hm. I just feel like I'm really lazy, and it sounds a bit nothingy. # Are you ready? # What's going on? Oh. # Are you ready? # Are you ready? # She is a little bit of a nightmare when it comes to, like, video shoots and photoshoots, and approving things, and it has been a bit hard within the group. # Are you ready? # I feel more pressure with you, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. I think people don't realise the effects of what bullying and trolling can actually do to someone. The trolls took away, like, her love for it, and, like, her passion. But how does she get that back? How does she... How does she go back to...feeling confident and feeling amazing, like, from all that shit that happened to her? The three of us, like, as her mates, just didn't know what to do and just had to sort of watch this amazing, funny girl sort of become a bit like a broken doll, it was horrible. We didn't have a control over what people were saying about her in the press and in the magazines, and on social media. And you can't hide her from the world. It was a constant thing that just kept eating away at her, and eating away at her, and then it got to the point, where she, literally, I don't think she could handle it any more. I think it might have been 2013, when I'd lost quite a bit of weight. We were going back on X Factor to perform our new single... ..and I didn't give a shit if the performance was going to be good, all I cared about was people seeing me and going, "She looks good. She's lost weight." Like, that's all I wanted people to say when they saw the performance. SONG: Move # Get your back off the wall # Don't you get comfortable... # And I just, literally, I starved myself for a week. I didn't eat anything, so I thought, "If I eat, then I'm going to put on weight and then people "are going to call me fat." And then the next day, the first interview that we had, the lady come in, and she said, "Have you seen what's been said about you online, Jesy?" Katie Hopkins just basically called you fat. All I remember feeling at that time was, "What's the fucking point?" I've just starved myself for a week, and I'm still getting called fat, so I could be the skinniest girl in the world, and this is never going to go away. And that was the pinnacle point for me when I got severely, severely depressed and it just spiralled out of control. And I remember being in a restaurant with my mum. I just kept looking around. I was just on edge the whole time because I just kept thinking people were talking about me, and I remember my mum saying, "Oh, Jesy, what's wrong with you?" She was just like, "Just relax." I just didn't want to be there, cos I was just so worried about everyone else around me. And I remember leaving, I went home, and I just sat in bed and I was just crying, thinking, "This is never..." Sorry. I just remember thinking, "This is never going to go. Like, I'm going to constantly wake up "and just feel sad for the rest of my life, so what is the point in being here?" There's no point waking up and feeling sad every day because...I couldn't, like, I physically, like, couldn't tolerate the pain any more that it felt like... It just, like, the only way I can describe the pain is that it feels like, if you've ever been heartbroken in your life, is it just feels like constantly feeling heartbroken. And I remember thinking, "I just need to make this go away "and it was the first time I thought I'm going to do this, "I'm going to...I'm just going to end this." And I just remember going to the kitchen, and I just took as many tablets as I could. And then I just laid in bed for ages, and I just kept thinking, like, "Just let it happen, just hurry up, "just let it happen," like, and then, I remember, my ex, who was with me at the time... I remember he woke up, and he was like, "Why are you crying? Why are you crying?" And I just kept saying, "I just want to die. I just want to die." And he was like, "Why are you saying that for? Why are you saying that?" And I was like, "Because I do, I just want it to go away." And he, like, was trying to make me be sick in the bathroom. And, then, yeah, and then the ambulance came. I remember the doctor said to me, "You're so lucky that you didn't take any more," he was like, "because that would have been it. "You could have done severe, severe damage to yourself." I remember feeling really angry at all those people. I wanted to just find every single person that had ever said anything horrible to her, and just look them in the eye and say, like, "Look what you've done to this girl!" Cos every single person that said something should have been held accountable for making her feel like that. That was just horrible. Knowing your child's done that and, you know what the worst thing was? Was knowing she was, like, literally, she lived three minutes' walk from me, so I was probably in bed and she'd done that to herself. And knowing your... It's just horrible. And knowing...can we stop there, please? Stop. Yeah, it's just, um...it's just horrible. You're just laying there going to sleep and you know one of your children are trying to kill themselves. I just felt... ..felt like a bad mum, really. When you're in that state of mind, all you care about is just taking that pain away. You don't ever... That sounds so bad to say, but you don't think about the people that you're going to leave behind. You just want the physical pain that you're feeling to stop. TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENT: You're travelling to Preston. I feel so glad that I'm still here, but I know that cyberbullying and trolling has had a devastating effect on young people and their families all over the country. I'm going to meet the parents of a young girl, who, like me, was targeted online. Hello. I like this filter. Nowadays, whether you're famous or not, you cannot get away from social media. And, for Sian Waterhouse, it was all too much. Just over a year ago, she took her own life. She was only 16 years old. Hello. Hiya. How are you? All right. Are you? I'm Ann, Sian's mum. Lovely to... I'll give you a cuddle. Hello. Lovely to meet you. Hiya. This is Sian's dad. Hello. How are you? Lovely to meet you. And you. Thank you so much for seeing me and talking to me today. Can you tell me about Sian? I can describe her as a female human version of Tigger. Cos she just bounced and skipped, wherever she went. Yeah. Yeah. And it was lovely to see. She was always, like, in her own little world, and... Yeah. Always smiling, always smiling. She always made friends easy. That's us swimming with her. Aw, that's such a gorgeous picture! The dolphins. And that's her last school picture. Oh, my God! She's stunning. Yeah, but I don't think she really believed how beautiful she was. Mm-hm. She didn't see what we saw, you know. Yeah. Was it her looks and her appearance that she was bullied for? Yeah, I think so. Mainly, when she came home, or late at night. Right. Facebook. Yeah. Group chats. Urgh. Mm. It's awful. Isn't it? Yeah. Did you notice the difference in her as a person, and her confidence? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. She wouldn't go out much. She'd rather be at home in her bedroom... Yeah. Where she feels safe. Yeah, she did. It's exactly as she left it. Make-up, everything everywhere. Even her boots are still there. Oh, yeah. It's just...the first door up there. Thank you. Aw. JESY SIGHS It's just so frustrating to see these pictures of her, because... ..she obviously was such a gorgeous, happy girl, and to think that these people just completely took that away from her and made her that sad that she wanted to do this. I can't... The fact that her mum can't even come up into her room just makes me feel so sad. Like, she won't ever, ever see her little girl again. I just think these people just have no idea the effect that it has on people. I don't want to be in here any more. It's really weird going into a room, where nothing's been touched, like, everything's still the same. It's weird. I feel like she's still there, it's really strange. It looks like how I leave my room. I think people say things and don't even realise the effect that it's going to have on someone. Right. Oh, give me a cuddle. Oh, Ann. I just think she's at peace now. Yeah. Nobody can hurt her. Yeah. That's the way you've got to see it, yeah. As hard as it is. You know, I just... I do feel her here. You know, I'll come down in a morning, and I'll shout, "Morning, Sian." What do you think could be done to stop this from happening to other young people? Do you think that social media have a responsibility, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter? Cos, obviously, anyone can go on there and say whatever they like. Yeah, I think they should be a lot more. I mean, this last time, they made a false account up of Sian's back from the dead. Oh, my God! And there were some really awful things. So, me and Pud went to the police about it... Yeah. ..and even the police said, "We don't even have a phone number for Facebook." He says, "And it'll be a false account. You can't trace it." I've tried getting in touch with Facebook, because, when they did this nasty account... Yeah. ..Sian's proper Facebook got took down as well. Right. ..so I've, like, messaged Facebook... Mm. ..time and time, asking them if they could reactivate it, as we've got... Yeah. She's got pictures on there, we've got messages... Mm-hm. ..and they don't even respond. Everything round, like here, is what people brought me. I mean, I've been lucky. We've all stuck together. Yeah. You know, and I think you need to with something like this. Mm. Her friends set up a balloon release on the promenade... Yeah. ..which is... That was all the balloons that were released... Aw! ..and people also painted pink pebbles... Yeah. ..and put them all over the wall. Amazing! Now you're safe up high Shoulder to shoulder with angels you fly No-one can touch you in your resting place And no-one can hurt you now that you're safe I wake each morning to start a new day But the pain of losing you never goes away I want to call you and just hear your voice Then I remember that I have no choice Some day I know all will be well And I'll see you again with stories to tell Until then, my memories of you I'll keep near And I'll pass them on to those who are dear I miss you, Sian and I wish you were still here. Sorry for getting upset. Can I give you a cuddle? Yeah, sure. Sorry. I feel like it's so weird. I feel like, even just you talking about her, I feel like I know her and it's really sad. I just think you are so brave. You and Ann are so brave. I don't think I've ever met two parents as incredible and as strong as Sian's parents. And for me, that, like, really, really hit home. I had the opportunity to overcome all of the trolling that I suffered. But what I find so incredibly devastating is that Sian never got that opportunity. We just live in a social media-obsessed world now, and I find that so scary, because now, kids growing up don't know any different. It's so important to teach kids at a young age and make them aware that bullying isn't OK and this is the effects that it has, and this is what one comment can do to someone's life. I've come along to a class, organised by an anti-bullying charity, to see how they're teaching kids how to deal with online abuse. Show of hands if you think social media's good? Yeah? I'm in between. I'm this. Why do you think social media's bad? I think there's more negatives than positives, like, being able to say whatever you like. Some things may hurt other people, and the thing is you can't always track down who it is. Yeah. It's anonymous. Yeah. So, why do you think social media is for the good? Or halfway there? For the good? For me personally, I think it's good, cos I get to interact with fans. Yeah. Which is amazing. But then there's, like, downsides with, like, trolling and, yeah, it's just quite negative sometimes. Yeah, it's quite mixed, isn't it... Yeah. ..social media? You can have the good sides, but also the quite negative sides. Yeah. Thank you. So, I'm going to talk to you a bit about the bystander effect. So, a bystander is someone who sees or knows about bullying or other forms of violence that is happening to someone else, but takes no action to address it or report it. Hannah herself was bullied from a very young age about the colour of her hair and her appearance. These are some of the things that people have said. Freak. Ugly. Now she's 17, she's using her own experience to try and help protect others. How would you help Jesy or I in this situation? What are some of the things that you could do? You could message the person who posted a picture and say, "Don't listen to them. "You look really pretty in that." Yeah, exactly. Use positive language instead of negative language. Why do you think these comments and post-it notes are in the pocket? They still stay with you. Maybe they're hidden away somewhere in the back of your mind, but they still do stay. Exactly. The words that people use, whether they choose to use them positively or negatively, they have a permanency and they stick with us. Exactly. I found being in that class really inspiring. I loved how many kids wanted to learn about how to stop bullying and how to help other kids at school. I just feel like if I'd have had that at school, it might have, yeah, helped me a lot more. MANY: Hi! Hannah's invited me to meet a group of other young people who have also been targeted by online bullies. I think it's really important that you are here today and doing this. I know that a lot of you have been through your own things and I thought it'd be nice for us all to share our own experiences with each other. Yes. Yeah? So glad to hear that! THEY LAUGH Yeah. I don't mind kicking this off. So, like, when I was younger in school, we're talking 13, 14, it was a lot of, like, texting, the anonymous calls. Literally, "You're a fat fuck. There's no point you even being here. "You're just eating all the food supplies," and that's literally... It was on and on and on. I would get DMs from random people I don't know from wherever and they'd be pictures or videos of really explicit content. Men performing acts over pictures of mine or videos of mine and just be like, "Oh, this is what you deserve. "You're just there to be used." I've been picked on because of, like, my height and I'm very skinny, so, like, I went to the gym for a long time to try and get myself, like, a little bit bigger, cos I thought that was, like, the best way to look because of, like, that's what society wants. But then at the end of the day, there are people out there that, like, are happy with the way I look and I should be happy with the way I look as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got told that my face is very deformed and that I should chop my head off so that they don't have to look at me any more. It was only actually a few weeks ago, someone said to me that I've gained a lot of weight and that if I could just control it I'd be pretty again. Oh, God. But I was bullied online when I was about 18 by my ex's friends. And one day I had enough and I told them, you know, "Stop bullying me otherwise I'm going to go to the police," and they said, "Just go kill yourself." And I'm not embarrassed now to say that I did try and kill myself, and I'm glad I'm still here. And the comments, people were telling me to, like, kill myself, to cut myself more, to starve myself to death and I was very suicidal. I just think it's really important that you're all here, because I wish I had people like you when I was that age, because nobody spoke about that in school. No-one talked about bullying or how to keep yourself safe online, and I just think you're all inspiring. MANY: Aw! Does it help you seeing that it's not just people... Oh, my God. Yeah. Absolutely. ..in the sort of celebrity limelight that get it? Yeah. It's exactly like us who are just normal and, like, we still get the exact same abuse. Yeah. Most of the group that I met were bullied because of their appearance, and they were harassed because of how society thinks they should look. I find it really sad that society is just so fixated and obsessed with the way that people look. It's not about people's talent or intelligence any more. It's all about the way you look. There's nothing else. Here we go. Let's roll camera, please. Hold your poses and sing. Thank you. Leigh-Anne, you want to strike a few poses? Yeah. Will, can you go in now? I'm going to go. Yeah. I know that some people think Little Mix might be a part of the problem, and I would hate to think that, because I want women to feel stronger and empowered, not weaker. And I know that people look up to pop stars like us and feel under pressure to look as good as we do in our music videos. But that's after hours and hours of hair, and make-up and lighting. Cinch me in. GULPS For me personally, I still feel a lot of pressure to look good all the time. It's really weird. I've never, ever, ever, ever liked doing music videos. It's a lot of pressure to look good, that's why. I think that's why it is. There's a lot of pressure to look good in music videos. And so if you don't feel good, it's really hard to, like, pretend to feel amazing, if that makes sense. Have you got anxiety now? Thank you. Roll playback. SIGHS BEEP Here we go. # Steady, are you ready? Are you ready? # I know there's probably lots of people that think, "Oh, God! "Shut up, you're such a diva." And I know I'm not a diva, it's just a guard that I put up because I'm trying to protect myself. If I don't look good, when people watch that, that's then going to cause people to then say nasty things about me. That scares me, having that feeling again of being, feeling weak and going back to that person I used to be. Erm... And I really wish that I could just not care. Like, I just feel awkward and uncomfortable. I just want to perform and be myself. Yeah. So, I just look shit and uncomfortable. You look tiny! GROANS It's weird, cos the more you compliment her and the more you try to tell her that she looks incredible the more she's like, "No, I don't!" And, like, she's adamant. What did you think when you watched that back then? Hated it. Despised myself, as per usual. It's very rare occasions that I like myself in videos. Everyone says to her she looks like a goddess, but she won't be told. There's no telling her. There is no telling the Nelson. Right, come on, round two, please. When I look back at old photos of me when I'm younger, like, I didn't care about the way I looked, I didn't care what people thought of me. And then social media came into my life and I became a completely different person. And I think you can tell that from my pictures now. I can't deny that I do post pictures... ..for other people's approval, and I don't know why. I know that I've got issues with the way that I look. But it's only now that I feel I can properly talk about it. I'm going to go see a body image specialist called Liz Richie, who works with people like me. I find a lot of comments online about me now are that I wear way too much make-up. What do you think about that? As long as you know and you're content... Yeah. ..with the fact that you are doing it for you... Yeah. ..then that's absolutely fine. I would maybe question who is Jesy behind the make-up? So, looking through your Instagram posts, Jesy, these photographs are so perfect. They are absolutely amazing. How do you feel when you post on Instagram? Do you feel that you need to post something that really looks good? Most of the time, yeah, because of the way that I'm supposed to look now. Right. And that that's been drilled into my head. Yeah. So, it's other people's expectations. Yeah. Yeah. I can't just post a picture of me where I don't look perfect. Mm. Is it something about other people validating you? I think so, yeah. Yeah, it scares me. Going back to being that girl again, being the fat one, the ugly one in the group. Mm. I don't like that Jesy. Like, I literally, like... I used to get such a, like... I used to get such anxiety, if I'd get in a relationship with someone, I'd get such anxiety if they were to, like, Google me, because I'd literally think, "Oh, my God, you're going to see the old Jesy, "and that's the Jesy that everyone hated and does that mean that you're going to be put off by that?" Mm. Which is a really weird way of thinking. Well, no, it isn't. But younger Jesy, she doesn't really want to be kind of left behind. Yes. As if, you know, that didn't matter, that wasn't important, because she's so important to you, because your creative persona... ..which is amazing, is something that serves a purpose. But your reality is Jesy. Yeah. Before X Factor. Mmhm. That's the person that you need to connect with, that will give you all of the right advice. As a result of the trolling, I really do think that Jesy had to protect herself. So she had to create an image, or what I would call a mask, to hide behind. And she perfected that mask and it was what she perceived to be effective and what the media wanted. I have shut away the old Jesy for such a long time, because I've just felt that I need to be this new Jesy that... Erm... I've felt like I've... ..had to be this new Jesy that everyone likes, because everyone hated the old Jesy. What Liz really made me realise is that that I loved that Jesy. And I can't just love this Jesy, I've got to love every part of me. Oh, it's cold. Lovely Southend, innit? Lovely weather. THEY LAUGH I actually quite like it. Do you? A lot people windsurf. You don't see that in Brighton, do you? No. I used to come here as a kid, though. Did you? Yeah, I loved it. What? With your mum? Yeah. Peter Pan's Playground. Where's that? Over there. Shall we go there after? Always on the rides. Were you? Yeah. So, I've been dating Jesy since, officially, the 24th of February. But she thinks it was the 16th of January. So, that was when we went on our first date. So, yeah, about four months up to now. When I first obviously started spending a lot more time with her, especially staying round her house, I noticed that she had many insecurities, there'd be, obviously, times where she wouldn't let me see her physically without make-up, especially for the first sort of four or five times where I'd come round here, we'd go on dates and stuff. She'd get up in the morning almost before, like, crack of dawn to make sure she was out of bed and putting make-up on and she got back into bed with a full face of make-up. So, I used to look at her and think she woke up like that, but she didn't. She was just, like, pre-prepared in getting up in the morning. But that, again, was purely her insecurity to not having make-up on. This is why she obviously can't... I say she can't go out in public, she doesn't really go out in public at all without any make-up on. She feels more comfortable as a human being wearing it, and that's fair enough. What's your favourite shop round here? Anywhere that does food. Yeah. Fish and chips. Yeah. You love a bit of cod and chips, don't you? LAUGHS Bit of mayonnaise. Lovely. She'll never wash your hair any time when I'm around, because it goes frizzy. She's naturally got this proper frizzy hair. So, I have to come to the fridge just to see it. And this is the photo. And I love it, cos that is her. And that's her with a fresh face, no make-up. So, sometimes, yeah, I do just come out of my way. I don't want a cup of tea but I still go into the kitchen. I just want to look at it for a few minutes and I'll stand here and I'll go back in and she'll say, "Where's your tea?" And I'll say, "I weren't that thirsty to be honest." There's another one there. She's got frizzy hair there as well. You're, like, very self-critical. Yeah. I'm the most self-critical person ever. But I dunno why. Look at you. Oh, shut up! You do! You have this aura. It's like a bit of a glow. Shut up! If you look at her eyes, they're like... Oh, my God! Stop! They're like golf balls. They're beautiful. Golf balls! You've got, like... She's got, like, a model's jawline. I love this bit, cos it comes in here and then the chin is very prominent... Chris, please shut up! She's got fantastic lips. LAUGHS Her eyebrows are brilliant, her forehead, everything about her. And you've got good ears. Oh, thank you. Very observant. I think one day it'll click and she'll look at herself and see that, you know, she is beautiful and she is unbelievable, and she doesn't see that when she takes her make-up off. That's what I tell her every night. Do my eyes really look like golf balls? Yeah. They're lovely, fucking incredible eyes, proper golf balls. I don't want golf ball eyes. Golf ball eyes, like a Titleist Pro V1. Like big, big and bold cats' eyes. No, I want nice... Catwoman. Right. That is nice. Golf ball eyes? Catwoman and golf ball eyes are completely different. It's lovely. My trauma does really run deep. And I may not ever really recover properly. But Liz mentioned that I really do need to reconnect with my old self, which I hate doing. And I just feel like that's just stupid. Like, what? That's silly that I can't do that. So, I felt like if I was to meet with Liz again, maybe that's something I can try and get over. Like, start looking at old pictures and clips again so that I can truly be happy within myself. How are you doing? Good. Yeah? How's it been since I last saw you? Really good. Weirdly, like, you said some things to me about, like, reconnecting with my old self. I've never really thought about it like that. Yeah. I think cos for such a negative experience and time for me that I just wanted to get rid of it altogether. That was such a significant time in your life and you're saying, "I didn't like that time. I didn't like me." And within that process you started to reject that Jesy. Mm-hm. In light of what we've just been talking about, I'm just really interested in how you feel when you look at these photographs. Yep. OK. OK. So... This is... LAUGHS ..very young Jesy. Yeah. See, this one makes me happy. Gorgeous. Why does that make you happy? Because I didn't have any cares or worries. No-one had an opinion on me then. Oh! LAUGHS Oh, yes. Is this pre-X Factor? This is X Factor. During X Factor. OK. There is a shift occurring now, because we're going into X Factor territory. Yeah. OK. How were you feeling then? Can you remember? Just really sad. But then if you were told at this point in your life... Yeah. ..that you were going to be doing this? Yeah. Like, that's all my dreams come true. Yeah. Yeah. And would you have thought at this age when you'll actually reach your dream that you would have been unhappy? Absolutely not. Would you be OK looking at some old footage of the X Factor days? Mm. Yes. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. We're going to do this with kindness. OK. Yeah? LAUGHS This competition is everything. I just have found my three best friends. To be with these girls has changed my life. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Is that difficult to watch? Yeah. Is it? # Just a little bit of you laced with my doubt... # I don't know why I'm getting upset! # Still a little hard to say... # Right, that's enough. How does that make you feel? Mm. Cos that, like... When everyone else watches that back, they relive a time of their life which was the best experience of their life. And that night all I remember doing was just thinking, "I just want to go home." Like, I didn't, I didn't care about winning. I didn't care about anything. I just wanted to go home, be with my family and just hide away. Yeah. But you actually managed to... ..get over that. Yeah. You managed to push through this. And you're here today. Yeah. You found strength from somewhere... ..to do what you've done since then. Yeah. What was that? What did you catch? What did you hold on to? Believing in myself. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's huge. That's such a big thing. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing that got you here. That self acceptance. That self belief. You have to look back at that and think that is an achievement. Yeha. You suddenly didn't hop from being in X Factor to where you are today. There's lots in the middle that you did. Yeah. And you did that as X Factor Jesy. Yeah. So true. So, you said to me, "I don't like that Jesy." Mm. But she did so much for you. I know. And I never... It's so weird, I never see it like that either. I'm like, "That Jesy bloody got me to where I am! Yeah. And yet, like, I've disliked her so much, all because of how people made me feel. Yes. But that was the external influences. Mm. That was not your internal influences. Yeah. You are an evolution of her. Yeah. She enabled your progress. Mm. She weren't that bad. LAUGHS She wasn't! She so wasn't. Yeah. Yeah? Thank you, Liz. You're so lovely. Thank you so much. You've really helped me. That was the first time I've ever watched anything from X Factor. And I know it was only a few seconds, but for me that's huge progress. Come on, Oscar! And I don't think I will ever be the same again. But what I do know is that I'm getting better. My mum was so scared about me making this documentary. And I think she's realised a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. And I've learned so much about myself. I think you've come so far now. It's made you... Be stronger. Yeah. Much stronger, yeah. Stronger now than even six months ago, a year ago. Yeah. A lot, lot, lot different. And I also think that through meeting other people that have gone through a similar situation that I have, that's helped me a lot, knowing that I'm not...I wasn't on my own. And I'm not on my own. Like, everyone goes through it. And I've really learned that when you talk about stuff that makes you feel low and feel down, the more you talk about it... It's like throwing it... I know it sounds stupid, like throwing it away and getting rid of it and, like, you become...you become stronger. And I just... Because I know I've got such a big fan base and even though I like social media, there's some parts I hate about it, I think if I've got that platform, I can use that to, like, help other young people who are feeling rubbish in themselves or feeling really low and down. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? I'm just so proud of you, Jes. I don't think you realise how proud I am of what you've done, from right from the beginning right up to now. Thanks, Mama. Oh, thank you, Mama. I know that Liz did say to me that my Instagram looks very perfect and my pictures are perfect, so today I am posting an old picture of me from X Factor, and this was the day after we won the final. Should have been the happiest day of my life. And what's really sad is that the other three girls sitting next to me were literally living their dream and this was the day that I remembered feeling like the whole world hated me. The thought of doing that six months ago would have given me so much, anxiety and I just... Oh, no, never in a million years. I couldn't have done it. So, along with this photo I am going to write out a message which will hopefully help other people who are going through what I was feeling, cos I just think if they can see this and think, "God, she was feeling exactly how I am," then hopefully they know that they can get through it too. I'm really pleased she's going to do that, and I think it's just a massive, massive achievement and she's come so far. I'm definitely seeing little signs of the old Jes come back and I can't wait. I'm so excited. "Six months ago this girl was someone I just wanted to forget. "I wanted to erase her from my mind and everyone else's memory. "I didn't see her as Jesy, I saw her as the fat one from Little Mix. "I hated her, not because she'd ever done anything bad "but because I was made to hate her by endless amounts of trolling. "Please, if you're feeling how I did, speak about it. "Cos there's always help out there. "If you'd have told that girl, 'one day you won't feel sad any more,' "I'd have never have believed you. And here I am. "Now when I look in the mirror, I don't see Jesy the fat one, I see Jesy the happy one!" Right. Three, two, one. Yay! She's up for the world! LAUGHS Oh, Jesus Christ. It's got 18 comments already. They're all just so lovely. CHUCKLES "You have inspired me so much and have given me so much confidence and I'm so thankful for that." "I've been dealing with the same thing for as long as I can remember, but I find this post very inspiring. "Thank you, Jesy, for sharing this, and thank you for everything you're doing for your fans." Jade's commented and said, "I can't wait for the world to see your journey. "I'm so, so proud of you and how far you've come. "I love you so much and, more importantly, I love how much you've grown to love you." # You stole the love that I saved for myself # And I've watched you give it to somebody else... # I feel like I've come on such a journey, and I feel like I've taken something so positive from that horrible time. I just hope that for anyone watching this, they can see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And if I can do it, then so can you. If I could give my younger self any advice, it would be... ..just that I promise one day you're going to be happy again. # Am I still not good enough? # Am I still not worth that much? # I'm sorry for the way my life turned out # Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now # Guess I'm still not good enough. #
