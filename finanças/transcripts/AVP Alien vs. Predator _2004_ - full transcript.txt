Lunch. Hey. Hey. hey Come here. Take a look at this. - What is it? - It's a data stream from PS12. - Where is she? - Right above Sector 14. There isn't anything in Sector 14. There is now. Hello. Miss Woods, pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Who is this? - My name? Maxwell Stafiord I represent Wayland Industries. Let me guess. He's suing us again? You misunderstand. Mr Weyland- he's offered to fund... the foundation with which you are associated for a full year if you'll meet with him. - When? - Tomorrow Tomorrows gonna be a problem. It'll take me a week to get back to the world. Yes, I told Mr. Weyland that. He said he didn't have a week. We must be right on top of it. What is it, Sebastian? Early 1950s, I'd say. Hey, Juan, we are almost there. Huh, according to you... The Teotihuac?n's final gift to their dying king was a Pepsi. - Come on. Give me one more month, please. - No. I'm bringing in another team. What? Without a crew and a new permit, we're out of business. Okay. Hold the team together for two days. I'll go to Mexico City, and I'll talk to the bank. - I'll get us more money. - Right. I might be able to help you accomplish that, Professor. Do I know you? In exchange for a little of your time. Oh. I'm sorry. I should have, um, switched the flash off. There's your magazine. Excuse me, - That's okay. I'm-I'm documenting the trip for my boys. This is them. Jacob and Scotty Would you mind just taking a picture? Thank you. - Sure. Just want to show them that their dad wasn't always so boring. - Smile. - Okay Oh. - There you go. - Thank you. Uh, I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer. Alexa Woods. Environmental technician and guide. Do you work for Weyland? Oh, no. No, I, um- I split my time between working for a small environmental group... and taking scientists on expeditions on the ice. Lex. You and your friend buckle up. We're gonna hit some turbulence. Thanks, jack. - Is he a friend of yours? - Of my dad's. My father trained most of the pilots down here. - Just passed the P.S.R. - Damn. I wish I got a picture. - Of what? - Um, the-the P.S.R. I wish he'd called it out before we passed it. The P.S.R. is the "point of safe return." It means we've used up half our fuel, so we can't turn back. Right. But if something went wrong, we could, uh... land, presumably. - We could ditch. - Yeah. Ditch. But the temperature of the water would kill us in three minutes - Weyland's check cleared. - Good, You know what? We're gonna listen to whatever he has to say. We nod, we smile... And we politely decline whatever offer he makes. Take the money, and we head back to Mexico. - Right. - Right. - Havin' fun? - Yeah. lt's quite an adventure. Listen, my kids are not going to believe this. Would you mind taking a picture? Um, you have to hold it like that till it flashes twice. - You're kidding. - Get off, or you'll wear your ass for a hat. - Okay. - All right. Okay. Sure. - Nice team spirit. Keep the beakers away from the gear. What does he mean, "beaker"? That's what they call scientists out here. - You know, Beaker, like in The Muppet Show. - Everybody please. Your attention. Mr. Weyland. Seven days ago... one of my satellites over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits... discovered a sudden heat bloom beneath the earth... which outlined this. The red lines indicate solid walls. Through thermal mapping... we've generated a rough three-dimensional image of the structure It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms... All built around a central core. My experts tell me it's a pyramid. What they can't agree on is who built it and when. One expert tells me this has features reminiscent of the Aztecs. Another tell me it's probably Cambodian. What they all agree on is that the smooth side... Is definitively Egyptian. - I think your experts are right. - Which one? - All of them. - Meaning what exactly? This pyramid contains the features of all three cultures. This might be the first pyramid ever built. - But built by whom? - By the first civilization. Thank you. But how could anyone possibly build a pyramid out here? Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice. It's likely the continent was once habitable, Well, I can't tell you who built it, but... If I can take a sample from it, I can tell you how old it is. Well, Dr. Miller, I'm offering to put you right next to this thing. Uh, what caused the heat bloom? - I don't know. - Where exactly on the ice is this? Bouvet?ya Island. But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000 feet below it. - Mr. Quinn. - Mr. Stafiord You're looking at the best drilling team in the world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days. And add three weeks on top of that to train everyone here. We don't have that kind oftime, Miss Woods. I'm not the only one with a satellite over Antarctica. Others will be here-soon. Maybe I wasn't clear. No one in this room is ready for this trip. Well, that's why I asked you here. Bouvet?ya is one of the most isolated places in the world, The nearest land is a thousand miles away There's no help if we run into trouble. You're right. lt's a no-man's-land. But the train has left the station. And I think I speak for everyone aboard this ship. This is worth the risk. Find another guide. Hydraulic Team 3 report for safety check on Deck B4. I've spoken with Mr. Weyland. The money's been wired to your foundation's account. Chopper's refueling to fly you home. - Who'd you get? - O.C.R. team in 1300 hours. Gerald Murdoch. Come in. - Gerry Murdoch has two seasons of ice time. He's not ready. - Don't worry about it. - What about Paul Woodman or Andrew Keeler? - We called 'em. - And? - They gave the same bullshit answer you did. - Bullshit? Mr. Weyland, what I told you wasn't bullshit. If you rush this, people will get hurt. Maybe die. - I don't understand your objections, Miss Woods. We're not asking you to take us up Everest. We need you take us from the ship to the pyramid and then back to the ship. That's it. And what about inside the pyramid? You don't have to worry about that. Once we're on the site... we have the best equipment, technology and experts that money can buy. - Is this new? - It's the latest. Mr. Weyland, when I lead my team... I don't ever leave my team I admire your passion. I wish you were going with us. You're making a mistake. Ah, it's in the upper atmosphere. Streams of protons and electrons from the sun... Being deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, causing a solar radiation storm. Shackleton called Antarctica the last great journey left to man. It's the one place left in the world that no one owns. It's completely free. Me-I'm sort of partial to the penguins. I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex. Come on. Don't make me pull out pictures of my kids again. Your kids aren't that cute. What if we got pictures of other people's kids? - Want my advice? - Mm-hmm. Stay on the boat. Okay. Let me ask you something. Do we stand a better chance of surviving with you... or with the number two choice? Miss Woods. Your helicopter is refueled. They're waiting for you. Everybody listen up! Gather round. - Told you she'd stay. - Gentlemen. She can't resist my animal magnetism. Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up. Gentlemen. It is my job to keep you alive on this expedition. And I need your help to do that. Since I don't have time to properly train you, I'm laying down three simple rules. One: No one goes anywhere alone-ever. Two: Everyone must maintain constant communication. Three: Unexpected things are gonna happen. When they do, no one tries to be a hero. - Understood? - Mm-hmm. - Understood? - Yes, ma'am. Good. Seven seasons on the ice, and I've never seen a gun save someones life. - I don't plan on using it. - Then why bring it? The same principle as a condom. I'd rather have one and not need it... than need it and not have one. I'm glad that you decided to stay Move the trucks out on the ice. Move that. Hey, let's go. - What's with the bottle cap? - What? What's with the bottle cap? Oh. This is a-a valuable archeological find. When I was a kid growing up in Italy... - you know what they call a moon that big? - Hmm? La luna del cacciatore. "La luna del cacciatore." - Brava. - What's that? Hunter's moon. - "Hunter's moon." - Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hold it, guys Keep those engines runnin'! Set it down. Hey. Move up a little further. Connors. It's an abandoned whaling station. According to your satellite imagery, Mr. Weyland... the pyramid is located directly beneath it. All right. Bring it up. Come on. Come on. Spread out. We'll use this place as a base camp. Mr. Quinn, begin drilling operations as soon as you can. I'm on it. Okay, guys. Let's move out. - What are these? - Whale bones. This station was abandoned in 1904. Everyone just disappeared overnight. It was a big mystery back then. Oh. One for National Geographic. Lex. - No one goes anywhere alone. - Shh. There's something there. Listen. Listen. Careful. They bite. Hey. Over here! Over here! What is it? Can you believe that? It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle. - How far does it go down? - All the way to the pyramid. There it is. Clear as day And the same time yesterday. - Nothing. - How was it done? Thermal equipment of some kind. Like yours? More advanced. Incredibly powerful. I've never seen anything like it. I'm telling you. There's no team and no machine in the world... that could cut to this depth in 24 hours. Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure... is to get down there and find out. Look at that. Change it now! Okay, guys. What's taking so long? - There is a storm coming. - Come on! Pack 'em and stack 'em! Get 'em inside! There's no room for sick men on this expedition. My doctors tell me the worst is behind me. You're not a very good liar, Mr. Weyland. Stay on the ship. We'll update you at the top of every hour. You know, when you get sick... you think about your life and how you're gonna be remembered. You know what I realize will happen when I go? Ten percent fall in share prices. Maybe 12. - That's it. - I've heard this speech before. My dad broke his leg 700 feet from the summit of Mt. Rainier. He was like you. He wouldn't go back or let us stop. We reached the top... and he opened a bottle of champagne. I had my first drink with my dad at 14,400 feet. On the way down he developed a blood clot in his leg that traveled to his lung. He suffered for four hours before dying 20 minutes from the base. You think that's the last thing your dad remembers? The pain? Or drinking champagne with his daughter 74,000 feet in the air? I need this. Come on. Move! Ah! Shit. Mr. Weyland! Man down! - Mr. Weyland! - Get him! Somebody get him! Move it! Now! I don't understand it. No equipment. No sign of another team. Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself. Move it. Connors, get those lights up. We have power. Congratulations, Mr. Weyland. Looks like you'll be leaving your mark afterall. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for this. Let's make history. Thomas. What is it? I recognize the Egyptian. The second symbol is Aztec. Preconquest era. The third is Cambodian. Then you were right The pyramid contains all three cultures. That's what it looks like. "You may... choose... to enter." "Those who choose may enter." Who taught you to translate? Funny. Kind of looked like you. Well, it's not "choose." It's "chosen." "Only the chosen ones may enter." Quinn, is that you out there? Mikkel. What is all this? This is the sacrificial chamber. Just like the Aztecs and the Egyptians. Whoever built this pyramid believed in ritual sacrifice. This iss where the chosen ones were ofiered to the gods. Those that were chosen would lie here. They weren't bound or tied in any way. They went to die willingly. Men and women. It was considered an honor. Lucky them. Oh, God. It's incredible. The entireskull and spinal column's removed in one piece. Look at this. Look at that. The cleanness of the cut. Straight through the bone. There's no abrasions, nothing. It's probably just the air moving through the tunnels. Maybe. Whatever this is, it's been dead a while. The bones have completely calcified. No idea how long it's been here, but the temperature has kept it preserved. Looks like some kind of scorpion. No. Climate's too hostile for a scorpion. Ever seen anything like it? "They gave their lives... so the hunt could begin." What happened here? It's common in ritual sacrifice to take the heart of the victim. That's nice. But that's not where your heart is. Besides, it looks like the bones were bent straight out. Something broke out of this body. What have you found, Max? It's a shaft to another level Looks like there's another room down there. Let's move to that lower room, Max. We're moving on, everyone. Miss Woods. You. Stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him. Keep a team with you. Catalog everything. Professor. This should be directly below the sacrificial chamber. Sebastian. It's a sarcophagus. This is the Long Count. This is the Aztec calendar. And this-It's some kind of combination lock. Days. Months. Years. The dials are set for... 1904. Someone opened this a hundred years ago? What's today's date? - October 10. - 10/10/2004. - You sure this is gonna work? - I don't know. Back up! Oh, my God. Take a look at this. Any idea what these are? No. You? - No. - It's a good thing we brought the experts. Well, yeah, It is a good thing. Cause this is like finding Moses' DVD collection Weyland. A little too much excitement. Okay We've, uh- We've been out long enough far today "We're gonna setup base camp tonight at the whaling station." and get back at it first thing tomorrow Well, you can go back to the base camp, Miss Woods, but, uh, we're staying here. No. You wanted to leave without proper prep. We did. You wanted to be the first ones here. We are. You've claimed the find. It's yours. Now, we move as a team, and we're done for the day. You heard her. What do you want to do with these, Mr. Weyland? - Take them. We'll run further tests on the surface. No. No! Don't touch them. Watch out. The doors! The door. What's going on? Look out. - See if you can stop it. - You okay? - Yeah. - There must be another way out. The slab's gotta weigh two tons. We'll never move it. What did you say this room was called? Sacrificial chamber. Thomas. Rousseau. - Tom, come in. - Come in, Rousseau. - Rousseau! - Tommy, come in. - Is there anything you didn't tell me? - Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine. Well, whatever it is, we're not prepared for it. We're gonna round up the rest of the team and get to the surface. Let's move! What are you doing? My job. Yours is over. - My job is over when everyone is back on the boat safely. And that gun doesn't change anything. This bearing should take us back to the entrance... and we'll regroup at the whaling station. What about Thomas? Rousseau? - We'll find them on the way up. - Max. Stone, Verheiden, cover our backs. The heat bloom that your satellite detected makes a lot more sense now, Mr. Weyland. - What do you mean? - Well, a building this sophisticated... Would require a major energy source. I think that's what your satellite detected A power plant for this pyramid firing up. - Preparing. - Preparing? - For what? - Gentlemen Keep close. - Recognize what's on their shoulders? - Yeah. We worshipped these things? According to this, we did. And the artifacts you removed from the sarcophagus... seem to be their weapons. Hmm. Let's keep moving, Only another 200 yards to the entrance. - Take cover. - Move! Move! Where's Stone? Stone! The pyramid's shifting again! The doors are dosing! Get out! - Come on! - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hey! Hey, Verheiden! Verheiden! Somebody! Run! Let's go! No! Quickly! No! No! I hit that son of a bitch dead-on. It didn't stop, it didn't slow. - Hey, Verheiden. - It didn't flinch! - Verheiden. - What? I am not a soldier, but I think you should calm down now We're not dead yet, okay? Well, thanks, Professor. Actually, it's "Doctor" and you're welcome. Okay? What? Hey! Can you hear me? It's Connors! Where are you? We're never getting out of this place. Have you got any children? - Got a son. - Yeah I've got two. That means that we do not have the luxury of quitting. We're gonna make it out of here. We're surviving this if I have to carry you the whole way. There's no way out back there. No damage. One of our men is dead. I need to know what this man died for. He died trying to make history. Whose? Yours? - What's that? - Just a theory. The Aztec calendar was metric- based on multiples of 10. Based on multiples of 10. I'm guessing that the pyramid reconfigures every 10 minutes. Let's stick together. Weyland. It would seem... that we are rats in a maze. Sorry. Shit. Connors? Connors! Verheiden? Verheiden. Oh, God. - Come on! Get me out of here! - It's okay I'm gonna find a way to get down to you, okay? Get me out of here! Verheiden! - Verheiden! - No! Want a piece of me? You ugly son of a bitch! Oh, God. Weyland, you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Leave it. It can only slow us down. Too much has been lost to leave here with nothing. Give it to me. - Max! - Max! Ow! - Hold on. - Look out! Come on. We have to get Weyland. Weyland come on. Move! Come on. Come on, you guys. - Come on. - What were those things? You tell me. You're the pyramid expert. I've got to stop. I've got to stop. Take it easy. Weyland. Weyland. Look at me. Look at me. You have to slow your breathing down. Slow, steady breaths. - Weyland, come on. - I can hardly stand. Weyland, I'm not gonna let you die down here. You didn't. There's another one! We have to go. Now! - Weyland. - Come with us. - Sebastian, get her out of here. Now! - Weyland. Come on. Run! Don't turn your back on me. - Lex, wait. - Weyland! You can't help him. We have to go. We keep it together, we make it to the surface. Let's go. Let's go. We keep it together, we make it to the- We keep it together, we make it to the sur- We make it to the sur- make it to the surface. Wait. This way. Go. Go! Look overhere. - He's marking himself. - What? Ancient warriors would mark themselves with the blood of their kill. It's a rite of passage. This is starting to make sense. I think this is a manhood ritual. The humanoid ones, they've been sent here... to prove that they're worthy to become adults. You're saying they're, what, teenagers? That's why they didn't carry those guns with them to begin with. They have to earn them. The hieroglyphs are a little difficult to make out... but the story's all here. Thousands of years ago, these hunters found a backwater planet. They taught humans how to build and were worshipped as gods Every hundred years, the gods would return. And when they did, they would expect a sacrifice. Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey. The hunters would battle with these great serpents... to prove themselves worthy to carry the mark. But if the hunters lost... they made sure nothing survived. An entire civilization wiped out overnight. So, the humanoids, the hunters... they brought those creatures here to hunt? And they use us like cattle. We're hosts for them to breed in. The heat bloom was designed to lure us down here. This whole thing was a trap. Without us, there could be no hunt. Shoot it! Verheiden! Oh, shit. When that door opens, we're dead. - Not if we set things right. - What do you mean? This pyramid, it's like a prison. We took the guards' guns, and now the prisoners are running free. To restore order, the guards need their guns. When that door opens, we're gonna give that thing his gun back. Are you crazy? During a big game hunt... the animals being hunted don't arm the hunters. They're not hunting us. We're in the middle of a war. - It's time to pick a side. - We are on our side. We have to consider the possibility we might not make it out of here. But we have to make sure those serpents don't reach the surface. Because if they do... everything everywhere could die. The enemy of my enemy... is my friend. Let's go find our friend. How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian? More or less. Move! Lex! Lex. Hold on. Come on, Lex. Oh, no. Wait. Wait. Please, wait. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Hey. I'm coming with you, you hear me, you ugly creature? What are you doing? Miller. - Sebastian. - Help me, Lex. - I'm gonna get you out of there. - It's too late. - It's inside me. - I'm gonna get you out of here. - You can't- - No! No. N- No! No. I have to help him. Lex! They mustn't reach the surface. - They mustn't reach the surface. - I know. Do it! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! It's a bomb. Well, I hope it kills every fuckin' one of 'em. You are one ugly mother- Got it!
