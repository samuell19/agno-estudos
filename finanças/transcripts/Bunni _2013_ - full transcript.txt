It was probably just a vendor or something. I mean, we do own a fucking business, we get calls all the time, stupid. - But it's not a vendor. I checked all of our lists. But, but, I don't know. I guess I was mistaken, who the fuck cares? - I called the number, Justin. Who's Bunni? - But what about Lisa? - Eh, don't worry about her. - I'm not. - How should I know who the fuck Bunni is? Well, I didn't, - So fuckin' what if I'm cheatin' on you? What difference does is make? - Shh, you don't want to wake up your son. - Why don't you just go in there and tell him the truth, that mommy is just a stupid fucking ass bitch who don't like to give it up for daddy! - Justin, please. - When was the last time we fucked? - You sound like a girl. - You fucking bitch! Justin please! - I am so sick of your fucking shit all the time. You're such a cunt! I fucking hate you! - I've been so good to you. - Listen, Lisa, btich, we never have sex and when we do it's always the same boring shit, over and over and fucking over! - I can't believe you. - You fucking bitch! Hey! Hurry up! Paige, hurry up! - Hold on Haley, it's my house. - Mom, will you tell Paige to hurry up. - Honey, your sister has to get ready too, okay? - Fine. - Boy, you look cute, Paige. - Slutastic as usual. - Thank you, so much, for bringing her here. What's wrong? - Nothing. My mom and sister are over here passing out candy. They're driving me insane. Well, don't stress too much, I'll be there to save you in a bit. - Is Ashley going? Yeah, Ashley and Rick are meeting us there. - Okay. - Rick, put the camera down. Alright, I will in a minute. - Come on, fuck me already! Oh don't worry, I will. - You better not show this to anybody. Rick, just fuckin' fuck me already. Come on. Or what? - Come one, fuck me hard. Or, too, I'll be comin' for you. Oh yeah.

Yes. - She is even hotter than the last chick. - Eh, I've had better. - Shit, you need to spread the wealth once in awhile. - She's in the other room. She's been passed out all fucking day. - You serious? - Don't be stupid, jackass. So you doin' anything cool for Halloween? - Yeah, I'm supposed to go to some stupid ass, bull shit, party thing, I don't, I dunno. Yeah, no, I was gonna go to a party tonight too, but they ended up calling me into work and it really sucks because I have this Spongebob costume I was gonna wear, but Jason's cousin said she was gonna go as Spongebob so I couldn't do that, it'd be really lame, I think, you know, especially since a girl and I'm a boy, it'd be kind of, really, really stupid to have us both dress like Spongebob, it wouldn't even make for cool pictures or anything. But there was this time that last, - Party? I wanna go to a party. - Oh, hey there um, - Destiny? - Yeah, whatever, um, that's not gonna happen. - Come on, please? Come on. Are we dressing up? Is that your costume? I wanna go. - No! I already told you I've got a bunch of shit going on tonight. You should've been gone hours ago. Bill, do me a favor, take her home. - For real? - Yeah, get her the fuck outta here. - You don't have to be a dick about it. - Will you just take care of it? Yep. - Hey baby. Are you feeling any better? - What? - You said you were sick last night, that's why you didn't come over. - I'm fine. - What are you doing? Just getting ready for the party. - I know, aren't you so excited? - I'm pissing my pants. - Okay, hurry up and come get me. - I will be there later. - Okay, please hurry. - Hey girl. - Hey! - Where's your boyfriend? - I don't know. - Hm, why am I not surprised. - Here, live a little Paige. - Uh, no thanks. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I just don't feel like it tonight. - Are you sure? - It's all you turtle man. - So, Rick, why haven't you called me back? - I don't Nikki, I've just been busy with stuff, you know. - Well, let's get out of here. - Sure, what did ya have in mind? - My place, you drive and I'll give you a little preview on the way, how does that sound?

What's a Wild Flings? - It's this, they sell like costumes and movies and sex toys, it's just awesome. - It's where he gets all his dildos. - No, no, me and my cousin Vinny A used to go here all the time, they always had the best Halloween costumes. - Better than Rick's I'm sure. - At least I'm not a Bee-otch. - Let's go check it out! - What?

Not the way you think. - So what's the problem old man? - Rick! - You don't wanna go messing around in that place! It's closed for a reason! - And that is? - Go on now! Get away from there! - Listen here, you smelly bastard, you've got about three fucking seconds to get your ass out of here before I shove this cart up your ass. - It's your funeral. - Man that guy gave me the creeps. - Me too. What are you doing? - I don't care what some homeless man says, I wanna see what's in here. - Oh my God. - Shit! What's your fuckin' deal Nikki? - Rick is my fucking deal. - Well, what do you expect? He's back with Ashley, remember? - And that didn't stop him last weekend. - So what, you're his new fuck buddy now? - It's none of your damn business who I fuck. Yeah, actually, it is my business when you use me to flirt with some dude's girlfriend while you go off and try to fuck him. - Like you wouldn't have taken her home, you jackass. So? That's me. Besides, you're my sister. I just hate when you act like mom. - Fuck you, I'm a big girl, and I can do whatever or whoever I want. You know what? I'm fed up with his shit anyways, fuck him. - See, that's the problem, you won't stop doing that. - Seriously? I am done with it. - Sure, heard that before. Shut up. - Well, speak of the devil. - What? Fuck you, Rick! What the hell was that? - I don't know, just some fucking drunk, stupid bitch, I don't know what the fucking, move out of the way. Oh fuck! - Oh my God, baby are you okay? - Yeah, I'll live. - Yeah, this place sure is awesome, Chris. - Whoa. - It smells funny. - I don't think we should be doing this. - Hey, if Chris wants to try on this old dusty lingerie I think, uh, just fucking let him, right Chris?

Oh my God. - This is great! - Oh, oh honey. - Huh, that's pretty old. - Yeah it is. - Hey Chris, Zack Morris called, he wants his phone back. - Who's Zack? - Did you hear that? - What was that? - I don't know, it kinda sounded like foot, - Shh! - Oh my God it's killing me! Ah you, - Shh! Are you fucking crazy, somebody's up there! - No one's fucking here, remember all we had to do to get in? I heard footsteps. - Electricity, that usually means somone lives here. - Are you all shitting me? Besides if there's someone living here it's just some fucking hobo and where there's hobos there's booze. I fucking hope someone lives here. Ashley, come here. - Oh, okay baby. - Ugh that fucking prick! What does he even see in her? - Well, - Don't even! Take me back there.

He's only a friend to himself and he treats everyone like shit. - He's not that bad, anyways, it's all gonna catch up to him sooner or later. Where are you going now? - Come on, don't you wanna see the rest of this place? - No, I wanna see my place, my own bed, with you and me in it. - Come on, just a few more minutes. - Fine. - What was that? - Stop being retarded.

So, are we still going to my parent's tomorrow? - Okay. - 'Kay. God, my feet are killing me. So, when am I gonna get to meet your mom? - I don't know, soon. - We've been dating for like six months now, I feel like you're trying to hide me. - No, Paige, I'm crazy about you, it's just, mom's been kinda weird since dad passed. - Ah, I know. I'm sorry. - No, it's okay, she's good, she keeps busy, I just try not to think about it too much. - I know you do. Come here. - This place fucking sucks. Fucking shit.

Is there a way out? - No, it's just a closet. - Fuck! What if we just scream, let's just scream and whoever's outside can come and help us. - Yeah, and let whoever's after us know exactly where we are? Besides, nobody's gonna be out there this late. - How do you know? - Because it's late. The bars are closed, nobody's gonna be walkin' around. - Fuck. Fuck. - Maybe there's something this way. - God I hope so. Chris I just wanna give up. I don't even wanna go anymore. - Okay, well that's not really an option here, we have to get out. - I can't do this, I just can't. - Okay, you're gonna have to calm down, just a little bit. I mean we have to find a way out of here. - What if there is no way out? - There's gotta be a way out. There's not just one fucking door to this place. Okay, you have to pull your shit together, Paige. - I don't know if I can. - Okay, you're gonna have to. Okay? There is no can. - Okay, let me check my phone again. Shit, now my battery's dying.
