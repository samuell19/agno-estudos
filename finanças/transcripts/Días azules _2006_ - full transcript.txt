BLUE DAYS -Boris, nobody comes here anymore. -That's why I like it. What for? It's even cold here. Relax, kids. It'll just be a minute. Brothers, this deserves a toast. To the future. Come on, Boris. Guys, homes are made to be bought and sold. -So you're glad? -Sure I am. We've been coming here all our lives. It's time to change. Let's go. Time to grow up. Summer is over. Your drinks, Alex. Thanks. You'd better get with it, kiddo. She disappeared. Give me one. I just fell in love, man. Again? No, this time it's for real. Hi. Are you two alone? Are you blind? She's with me and I'm with her. I love smart-asses. Can I buy you a drink? Luisito... -Where's Carlos? -He went to find Belen. You know how couples are, always together. I wouldn't know. Neither would you, right Alex? I've heard things, but not a lot. What will you do with this bed? Leave it here. It's worthless. Let's keep it and take it off the Wedding List. It has special meaning for me. Belen, let's be realistic. Should we keep the rug, washing machine and kitchen table as well? The washing machine... On spin cycle! Love is a myth some clever guys came up with so they could get laid. Until you understand that, you'll never get anywhere. Yeah, whatever you say, Boris. But look at Carlos. He loves Belen enough to marry her. What a family we have! A bossy dumb ass, a smart-ass fool and the eldest is out of place. -How do you know her? -From Madrid. I woke up one morning in bed with her. So we started talking. Very nice girl. It didn't stick. Hold on. -What'll it be? -Pisces, right? Yeah. -You want a drink? -Born in 1975? Damn, you're psychic! How's your mom Maria Elena doing? -Have we met? -No. My name's Boris, Elena. I found this on the ground. Shit! Damn. I'm a disaster. Thanks a lot... -Boris. -Boris. Drinks are on the house tonight. On the house, eh? How should I take that? With vodka? With gin? With humor? Should I take it seriously? Or with you? Take it easy. Genoveva gets hotter every day. You don't say. It's scary how observant you are when you're drunk. You freak me out, German. Have you seen the others? When was the last time you got laid? You think there's another life before this one, or what? Sometimes I can see. I see how they will come. You'll come behind me. Carlos! Right here! Floating over the sea in my head. Singing, dancing... And saying that you'll never leave me... You kill me, playing that song whenever you see me... It's awesome. Face your past, man. The nights in the bar. The bar behind you. This time is true. Written on a page in wooden prose... What an amazing song you wrote there. ....recorded in my memory like in a stone. Crying, calling, saying that you'll never leave me. Where are all the days and that blue... Of a place where you were too. Because if luck is pushing us until the end, then all is left to chance. This blue... is going to kill us, to catch up with us. What does your mother think? It's fine with her. She never comes anyway. She says only when she's dead, to be buried with my dad. There was no other solution? Well, sure. The lottery. The bigger machines cost a bundle. You could sell the press. And what would we live on? You guys are depressing me. Where will we have our parties? You'll be missed. -We'll still come. -Yeah. Less and less. Madrid is far away. What about me? Will you miss me? What were you talking about? You don't love your friends anymore? Of course I do. I love you a shitload, man. What would we do without friends? Nothing. I love you a ton, bro. Man, I love you so much. Ever since you gave me the Monopoly. I love you more. If you loved me you wouldn't go to America for 3 years. Don't be a dummy. A ton. I love you a ton. What's the plan? They're coming tomorrow afternoon, before we leave. And we give them the keys. You could have gotten another week. You're leaving in 10 days. Exactly. One last week here. Typical. A beautiful day outside and you two in here playing dice. You woke me up. It's about time. Hey, I don't mind. But we have a guest. I saw you leave alone. Nice try, Boris. -I must have dreamt it. -You must have. Fine, he can talk. But you're looking paler every day. You'd better stop seeing so much of her. -So much of who? -Miss Hand. Wankie-Wankie. Come on, let's get some beers. When you get back from Boston you'll be a god. Or a gum-chewing gummy bear, like Boris says. You have to go. Not everyone gets a Fullbright Scholarship. And stay sharp. Once you're there, you're nobody. I know, Carlos, I know. You already told me. I hope I at least learn to buy homes instead of selling them. -Things are really gonna change. -Yeah. The party's over. It's Boris I'm worried about. With you married and me abroad... He's not as weak as he looks. He's a flake. A flake? Fine, not a flake, but I'm worried about him. So am I. Excuse me, ma'am. Will they take much longer? No, they'll be right out. Hurry up, girls. Are you from Rio? No, San Salvador de Bahía de Todos los Santos. -A cruise around Europe? -Not anymore. We head back tomorrow. I'm so jealous. Brazil. I'd come with you. Boris, we're ready. Let me help you. I love chicks who take their time getting ready. Today we're gonna have a titty of a time. Let's go. -Bye. -See you. What's up, redhead? Didn't you say no beach today? I changed my mind. I love chicks who change their mind. Hop in. -We can't put six in the car. -Confirm that. No, you can only take five people. And we won't fit, Boris. Out. -What? -You're kidding, right? No, you said it. The law is the law. Get the fuck out. Hop in, gorgeous. You've got class, bro. That's life. I didn't make it that way. I'm blown away. With that ponytail, and you win the lottery. Get a clue, brainy. The ladies like to fuck, too. They don't show it. Do they fucking show it. And American girls even more. So get yourself laid over there. You're not swimming? No, later. What about tonight? What time should I pick you up? Don't get your hopes up. I have other plans. Yeah? Great. I love chicks with initiative. But since plans never work out, make plan B a night with me. Okay? What about Genoveva? I thought my birthday was girls' night out. Yeah, but she didn't have the car. Pity. I can pick her up if you want. -You don't mind? -No. It'll be guys' night out, too. Okay. See you in a few. Alex, this is Estela. Estela, this is Alex. We ran into each other in the street. I'll leave you two, I think you have a future together. Boris, where are you going? -Boris. -Is that really his name? No, it's a nickname. He's loved vodka since he was a kid. And since he fancied himself a revolutionary, my dad started calling him Boris. It does suit him. So does vodka. What ever happened to the oil rig? I blew it off. They don't pay that much. And there's no chicks. I like fish, but not sleeping with them. You'll never go anywhere. Whatever you say. Where's that nice girl you've been seeing? She dumped me. Life is unfair. I don't believe in much. But love and justice take the cake. Then why study law? Because I'm good at it. I'm in 4th, with a 1st year, a 2nd year, and several 3rd years. You flunked all those courses? You look so smart. Students, Luisito. I was talking about girls, not courses. Genoveva, we have to talk. Just as well you realized. What happened the other day can't happen again. We can't do that to Belen. I understand. That's why you brought me here? What do you mean, here? It's on the way. We can't talk about it in front of her. Why do you always let everyone else decide for you? Because I never get to do what I want. You're a big boy now, aren't you? When my dad died I had to take over everything. And I'm still there. Carlos, I know what I want. But if you don't love me, what we're doing is wrong. I don't even know what I want. Make up your mind. And tell me before you leave. Give me a vodka and lemon. And a kiss. There's your vodka and lemon. I think I've already given you enough kisses. -I want more. -No more for now. I treat you like a queen. You must be getting something back. Hey, come here, come here. Have you ever been in love? In my case, yes and no. What does that mean? I say yes to some and no to others. I don't know what I'd say to you. Say no, or say yes, but with another girl. Nice bracelet. Too much. Come on, let's go. Is that the guy from Accelerated? Yeah, he was the bass guitarist. -And he's my brother. -Another one? How many are you? Three. We make a good team. Carlos charms them, Boris takes them to bed... And you? I fall in love. I'm the dumb one. Carlos, where did you park? -At the port. -Okay, cool. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Are you? Sorry, tonight is guys' night out. -What's up, man? -Fine. If you keep drinking, you won't be able to get it up. No, I'm drinking to keep it down. Still wanna go to Brazil? Sure. -You know how to sail? -I can hold my own. We could use another crew member. What time do you set sail? At nine in the morning. Comrade, search no more. At nine. Don't flake. -I won't. -You know how to cook? Pops! I have huge news. Where's Alex? Alex! Alex! Guys, I've had a burst of inspiration. Tomorrow morning I set sail for Brazil. That's right, it's time for adventure. My genius is being wasted here. -What are you talking about, weirdo? -You heard me. On a sailboat to San Salvador de Bahía de Todos los Santos. -It's time to grow up. -Yeah, right. Sure. I am! Boris, that takes balls. Brothers, this deserves a toast. To the future. You sure had rotten luck, Dad. I'm leaving. That's right. You'll see, I'll kick ass in Brazil. I'm finally leaving. ...they said to prove it she had to go there under a full moon. And when the girl was walking alone in the cemetery, something grabbed her from behind... What a story! The little girl gets scared to death. Is it that one? I know a better story, and it's not a thousand years old. It's real and it's happening right now. Have you seen in the papers there's a gang of vampires from Greenland looking for children? No? The vampires only go to cemeteries with trees, like this one. They hide and wait for children to come to kidnap them and suck their blood. They get all their blood drained and they turn white as snow. They're not dead nor alive, they're in a phase in between. They can't eat or drink or talk or watch TV. They can't do anything. When those bad-ass vampires fly away, the tree branches shake from their force. I'm a cop from Moscow sent to capture the vampires from Greenland. No, it's Transylvania. Not these vampires, little girl. They're from Greenland. And they're the blood-thirstiest. So I have to get you out of here before the tree branches start shaking. They're attacking me! By Mother Russia! Bang, bang, they're dead! I was only fucking joking! Alex, are you okay? -Yeah. -What's that? -It's nothing, Boris. -Where's Carlos? He's giving a police report. What happened? A dog ran in front of us. Fucking dog. -Are you okay? -Yeah. She's dead. Who? Estela. Can we go? Carlos has to come with me. What for? He tested positive for alcohol. Come on, Rafa. He has to see the judge in the morning. Let him get cleaned up. The rules are the rules. Rafa, you've been a friend of the family for years. Okay, but he doesn't leave the house. I'll pick him up at eleven. Thanks. Negligent manslaughter gets you six years, with parole after four. -It was an accident. -You were drunk. I have a friend who spent three months in jail and it totally fucked him up. He'd punch anyone who looked at him. Whatever, Boris. I'll deal with it. Go on, good luck. -What's up, man? -All right. I thought you wouldn't show. Get on, we're leaving. My brother's taking my place. What? There's no extradition with Brazil. It would be cowardly. Don't be fucking stupid. It's either jail or Brazil. Untie that rope. Can you cook? Take good care of him! SEVEN YEARS LATER Sorry we're late. Boris fell asleep, for a change. What's up? -Where's Clara? -The nanny stood us up. This is your famous convertible? Yeah. Wanna drive it? No, I'd rather not. Are you kidding? I saw it was for sale 3 months ago and I bought it. What for? Because it's ours. The damn midget sure kept it quiet. I couldn't believe it either when he told me. Oh, I get it. News travels fast in this family. Alex, take off your sunglasses and you won't need the light on. Clara? Yeah, we got here fine. Okay, I hear him. We'll talk later. Could someone live here? It won't be me. Smart-asses. We're already making use of it. And it's worth 5% more than I paid. I told you. He's sick. We'll have to make the beds. Are the sheets in there? Little ants, I don't know about you but this grasshopper is starving. Goddammit. I'd rather not be seen too much. Don't worry. It says right here the statute of limitations expired a year ago. How's your restaurant? Fine, someone offered to buy it. -Good offer? -Worth considering. Then don't accept it. Accept it and come to Madrid. I can help you out. I don't know. I like living there. Brazil. People sing and dance at the best funerals. And I'm the one who got stuck running the shop instead of going to Brazil. You'd have made a splash in Brazil. You guys look happy. You'd never know you're burying your mother tomorrow. Here in town we still remember what a coward you were, Carlos. You screwed my promotion. I'm sorry. -You're sorry? -It was my idea. When have you ever had any ideas, Boris? I just had one. I need a line. Well. It's what we expected, right? Hey, what's up? You two got any spare joints you can sell me? It was a cigarette. I'm not a cop, you know. Yeah, but we weren't smoking that. Okay, fine. I'm a drug addict. Look, we were just leaving. That got me paranoid. Tonight's my night. Straight whisky, please. And an alcohol-free beer. -No exceptions? -You either drink or you don't. I'm going to the bathroom. Yes? Okay, fine. Great. No, call him on Monday. Yeah, close it but make him wait. -German! -Long time no see. -How's it going? -Fine. And you? You stayed in Boston for years. Yeah, five. Look at you. And you weren't sure about going. I heard about your mom. I'm sorry. Right, thanks. What about you? I married Genoveva. Genoveva? Damn. So there is another life. -And you? -An Argentinean. We worked together. And you're loaded. You bought the house. We'll see if it was such a great idea. Is it just an investment or are you guys coming back? I don't know. -Hey, German! -Hello. Listen, guys. I'm with my friends. We'll have a drink sometime. -We're leaving tomorrow. -See you around. Guess who Genoveva ended up marrying? Hi. Know where I can find Elena? -The redhead? -What redhead? Forget it. Give me a vodka. -What kind? -Anything Russian. -Sir, you got a light? -Sure. Don't call me sir, sweetie. Married with kids, right? No... and no. You're 0 for 2, gorgeous. Well, thanks. Go heavy on that vodka. It's the second time he's tried. He just wants attention. Boris gets enough attention. That's true. One of these days he'll succeed. Let's hope not. I dreamt of Estela again last night. I dream of the accident as well. In the dream I'm driving. But I was driving. We should tell Boris. What for? Look how mad he was about the house. If you wanna see him really mad, tell him. I don't dream about the accident. I dream we're strolling at the docks, and all the fishing boats, and we're talking, laughing, arm in arm. What's wrong, Alex? -Problems with Clara? -I don't know. I don't know. How about you? What happened with Belen? She left everything to go to Brazil with you. Yeah, but I'd already stopped loving her. It just took me forever to realize. I dream about Estela every day. If it weren't for the kid, I don't know if I'd be with Clara. I don't know. Boris, the funeral's in 15 minutes. That's why I'm here, little ants. What happened? Nothing. Worry about the other guy. -Thanks for coming. -Of course. Alicia couldn't make it. She sends her best. -You remember her? -Yes, perfectly. Her and her girls' night out. How could I forget? I don't know, it's been so long. You always had a good memory. We all have something. You weren't so profound before. Brazilian philosophy. Mom, when are we leaving? Right now. You didn't tell me you had kids. Well, I do. What about you? I have a son as well. You didn't tell me anything, either. See what handsome kids I have? Yeah, they look like you. This is Fernando. Hi, Fernando. I'm Carlos. -Say hello. -Hello. Genoveva, we're leaving! Coming! We're leaving. The boss is in a hurry. -Hi. -Give me a kiss. Come by later for some coffee. -Okay. -Okay? See you later. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Fine and you? Fine. Here I am, two years to adapt to Brazil, and another two to readapt to Spain. I hope I never fall in love with an Australian. You look great. I like the earring. It looks good on you. Why didn't you tell me Genoveva had a baby? You didn't tell me you were screwing her. Well, they're back together again, as Mom wanted. They really loved each other. That's love, right? Did you hear the gravestone creak? I was thinking... that one of us will see the other two die. -And I'd rather it was me. -I'd rather it was me too. But I wouldn't be left on my own. I've got my son... Hey, this is new. Shall we leave after we eat? We could buy some chops. Right. He's not doing well. What do you think? That he's finished there. But he doesn't know where to go, as usual. You could have him run the shop. You know it's not my thing. He won't jump for joy. Think it over. You won't have to flow him pocket money every two months. What would you do? Maybe hop on the next boat out of here. Don't worry, I always land on my feet. Yeah, on your feet. If not, I get up. Alex, listen to this. See what you think. -Sounds good. What is it? -Some kids I met. I helped them tape a demo. Excuse me. Hello? Fine and you? Not a lot, about 20 people. Is Victor there? Yeah, we're going out after lunch. Hi, little man! Are you having fun? Yeah? Give me a kiss. I can't hear it. Bye, champ. This is almost ready. Boris, lunch! This is delicious. I'm feeling outstanding, kids. Finest quality meat, son. Speaking of food... There's lots of pussy in town. I met some very receptive Russian girls. So first the beach, then dinner, and then party time. How about it? I thought we were heading out right after lunch. -Sounds good to me. -Sure. The hell we've had to go through to be reunited again. No wives or kids, like before. I like the idea of a wife and kids, and of all of us here together. We're going off tonight! If you didn't bang Brazilians or play soccer, what did you do in Brazil? Capoeira. A Brazilian dance. Brazil is the shit. Boris, it's not what you think. Most of them are poor. I thought it was awesome. You weren't there long. How's Claudinha? Did she tell you to say hi? She didn't mention anything. She told me she liked how I kissed her lips. The lips on her mouth, eh? -Don't get me wrong. -You still think with your dick. I can't think without it. Is yours detachable? Last one in's a fag. Getting older sucks. Chicks don't even see you. Maybe you should aim a little older. It has its advantages. Yeah? Name one. I don't know. You worry less about lots of stuff. Chicks, for example. Yeah, right. And you learn a lot. For example, I've discovered I have a prostate. I read that masturbating frequently cuts your chances of prostate cancer. Then the midget here must have a prostate of iron. I'd rather jerk off like crazy in my 20's than in my 30's. Jerking off like crazy is great at any age. You need to find yourself a girlfriend. Yeah, I know. I just can't find the right girl. Cut the crap. You've just never been in love. Nobody has. I just acknowledge it. Besides, I'm over the hill. Yeah, right. I was walking through Pelourinho in my brand new Adidas... when two guys grabbed me by my armpits and lifted me off my feet. -No shit. -Then another guy ran up, grabbed my shoes and they took off. -Really? -I just stood there, barefoot, totally blown away. Stop. Pull over, pull over. I'll catch up later. Go on, drive. Take it easy. Come and play goalie with me. See if you can block it. Mommy, mommy... Shoot, Daddy! Come on. You have to help me unload. -What? -You're just in time. Come on, give me a hand. Where does the man want it? There. There, it's perfect. A tree with an anchor. Life is absurd. You're an artist. Remember when I painted Alex's room? He totally freaked out. He looked like a psychopath. -You ruined his room. -Yeah, but that look in his eyes. It was terrifying. What a night out, eh? We're in bad shape. Who wants the last asparagus? Are you nuts or what? Relax, it's his mid-life crisis. It's worse than I thought. I'm sick of this bullshit. It's my book. Do I talk shit about your lives? I don't, do I? You are both so full of shit. You're hurting my prostate. See that temper? And by the way, I'm fucking sick of your little secrets. I know you were driving that night, Alex. The car keys were yours. -Boris, it was my idea. -You think we saw it all coming? I've been waiting for years to hear it from you guys. What pricks. What's wrong with you? You think I'm just some no-good junkie? That I can't keep a secret? I'm your older brother, you fools. Hey. Need a hand? That looks heavy. Thanks anyway, it's just over there. We'll share the load. Or you can carry it yourself, if it's diamonds or something. But a little chat might make the journey feel shorter. -Want some? -Thanks. My name's Boris. And you? -Olga. -Does that mean something? -What? -I don't know, like... "Olga" has the same letters as "something" in Spanish. Right. And we both have Russian names. Boris Godunov and Olga Korbut. -Know who she was? -No. A Russian gymnast with great legs. -I know who you are. -Oh, yeah? Who? As a kid, you told us the story of the vampires from Greenland in the cemetery. That was you, wasn't it? Yeah, that was me. How about running the shop again? -I have other plans. -Yeah? Like what? The Brazilian group. Keep it. They're awesome. I want to release an album here. Carlos, you're too old. I can hook you up with a job if you want. We could help each other. Stop right there. I'm too old to start a group. But I know Brazilian music. But you're too old to go door to door with a demo. You need to start making money. It's not so hard. We'll follow your romantic instincts later. In Brazil I learned how to live well with much less. I'd have liked Brazil, too. And I'd have liked to stay here. You think I'm glad you took my place? Always pushing me to be the best, the most ambitious... I'm everything you guys wanted me to be. -Nobody's twisting your arm anymore. -No? You sacrificed yourself for my scholarship and I can just take off? That's right. You don't owe me anything. Getting on that boat was an escape for me. I was a mess. You haven't made much progress. You're still a follower. Sometimes you have to swim upstream, son. You haven't, either. You dream of a dead girl in bed next to Clara. You're nuts. Fuck you. Alex! When you cool down, meet me at Dokrys! Shit! Let's have a drink to celebrate meeting up again. Wait here, I'll be right out. What kind of place is this? I can see you've been away a while. It's been years. But I know Dokrys is popular. Dokrys? That's for couples. Yeah, but I like quiet places when I'm getting to know someone. Hey, buddy. -Lemon soda. -Gin and tonic. You don't drink? I don't trust the stuff they serve you. It's for my health. Fancy a line of coke? Okay. Had enough being a fucking clown? What? Why did you guys come back? -You preppy fucks don't belong here. -Who are you? Estela's brother. Remember? The girl you killed. Of course I remember. -I asked you a question. -We're here to bury our mother. Your mom's time was up. But not Estela's. If I see your brother I'll kill him. Kill me. I was driving. -Don't be a hero. -I'm not being a hero. I was driving. But it wasn't my fault. You killed her and got off. It ruined my life, too. I loved her. Come on, man. -You'd be like Juliet. -Juliet who? Romeo's beloved. I don't know, if I found a Romeo... Why do you say that? Because I love those stories. Knowing that love can break all barriers. Families have no say nowadays. People marry whoever they want. I know. A pretty girl like you must have a boyfriend. No, I have several. I need you to save my soul. What? That's what Romeo says to Juliet. Romeo was really something, wasn't he? Nice to see you guys. Hi. -How are you, German? -Fine. We were just leaving. I'll go pay. Spying on me again? He's got quite a kick. What about me? Am I a good goalie? You're great. Does his dad visit often? -He doesn't even know he has a kid. -Maybe he does. I doubt it. Do you really? Of course. He was Italian. Very handsome. I haven't seen him since. He had beautiful hands. Sure. It's a good story. The problem is I'm not Italian. Not even my suit is. Whose son is he? He's mine, Carlos. And German's, since six years ago. No, Genoveva. He's ours. Today I found out he exists. And that I've loved you all along. No, it's okay. I missed you. Clara, I know I've been weird lately. No, you haven't. It's me. I'm sorry. It'll be fine, okay? I love you, too. Give the kid a kiss for me. I'll see you tomorrow. I hate how life slips away. Well, that's life, right? Maybe. Today I found an anchor. It was a message. It said we can still hold on, that everything isn't luck. You believe in that stuff? Sure. Well, depending on the times you live in. Why must luck always be a bad thing? For example, today I missed the bus and had to wait until nine. And that's how I met you. Right. I'll tell you a secret not even my brothers know. My dad had a lover. And he crashed into her, when he went to see her. In Burgos. They wanted to surprise each other, and they both died. I've wondered if it was punishment or fucking luck ever since. Why haven't you ever told them? What for? Knowing was never any help to me. I'd rather they idealize the love between my parents. I might not look very old, but I've had my share of bad luck. You know why I remember the vampires from Greenland? Because my sister got killed that night. In a car accident nearby. And all you can do is face it and get back up again. I like the way the lights reflect. You think you can come back and say all these things to me? Yeah, because they're true. I've always gone with the flow. It's time I swam upstream. Be careful not to drown. Charge me or I'll leave without paying! Hey, German. How's it going? -I'll buy you a drink. -We're leaving. Hey, man. Can I pay my bill or what? To the good old days. Fuck the good old days. All of a sudden... I feel younger than I have in years. Congratulations. But you don't look any younger. Because you don't know me anymore. Carlos, we need to slow this down. Yeah. For example, if we weren't in love, what we've done would be wrong. Genoveva, shall we go? I'll keep swimming! Bottoms up. Thanks to these flasks the Russians won in Stalingrad. You have beautiful eyes. I can't believe the little girl in the cemetery turned into this amazing woman. You know, last year a girl slipped and drowned right here. Don't get too close. Don't worry, I'm not drunk. -Shall we go for swim? -Now? No, tomorrow. Olga? He's pretty funny sometimes. Brazil. -He's the best. Number one. -The fucking master. -Where are you going? -To the police station. What for? I was with a girl at the docks and I think she drowned. What do you mean, you think? Where is she? We went swimming and she jumped in first. I took off my pants... -and she didn't turn up. -What do you mean? -She jumped in the water and drowned. -Are you sure? Yeah. And she was Estela's younger sister. History repeats itself. I'll go to the police. Don't look at me like that. I should go. Tell me why not. Boris, you have a record and he doesn't. Alex, I'm not like you guys. Olga! You blew me away, man. You took off. There I was, freezing my ass off hiding behind a boat. -I called you. -Yeah, twice. Here, put this on. I thought you drowned. I was headed for the police station. I just wanted to get you back for the scare at the cemetery. Well, you got me back a thousand times over. Who are these two? They're my brothers. -Your brothers? -Yeah. This is Alex and this is Carlos. The only thing in my life not left to chance. I'm Estela's sister. We know.
