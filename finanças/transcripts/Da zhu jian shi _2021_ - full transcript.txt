It was a time the emperor started to confiscate all weapons. He commanded Meng Yezi, the best swordsmith in the realm, to make him a legendary sword – Sword of Light. When the sword is ultimately cast, Meng Yezi cast Sword of Shadow, to rein Sword of Light for incoming bloodshed. The danger arrives at his doorstep, while Sword of Shadow is yet to be done. Kill them. Father! Father! May the Sword of Shadow bless my son Meng Yang For a life of peace. Father, come with me! My time has come to an end, yet I haven't finished the sword. You can revenge for me when the sword is ultimately cast. Father, come Go! Zhao Han Sword of Light, So fine. Who really wants me dead? His Majesty, or you? There's nothing more to be said. Someone paid 22 pounds of gold For your life Come on then However We, White Rainbow Assassins, will shed no blood on an unlucky day Today is a big unlucky day So count yourself lucky Boss is ready Quickly, One, two, three You seem like a good man You can have half the gold Leaving a personal object, and I can spare your life. My good man, you can have all the gold Now! Quickly Where did you get the sword Those who know the answer were dead already One can see the person through his sword. I hope you deserve to own it. What does that mean? Don't come closer So... we done? Boss awed him You don't know shit. Awed him? Who shot the arrows? Him. You almost got me Dangit. Be quiet! Be quiet! Back off!

Hey bro We are castellan's servants Not refugees Please let us in No. Why they do that? Shame Jesus Not nice. What are you looking at? Tell the guards The refugees might sneak in after dark Castellan Luo Your Highness Castellan What do you think of my boots Well-made They match well with your temperament Speaking of the boots, I'll have to tell a story Ten years ago A grand famine broke forth around here. Refugees don't know where to go The castellan, however, is a forethoughtful wise man He was afraid that the refugees might cause chaos in the city So he closed the gate When the refugees had nothing to eat and no place to live They marched north and seek refuge with the barbarians Not long after They took revenge And brought the barbarians into the Red Town They skinned the castellan alive And Made the boots with his skin Hey, you fool upstairs! Open the freaking gate! Open it! Or I'll stick you with my fingers One by one! Aren't you scared! The human skinned boots still look new and now they are- I get it now Your Highness Open the gate and let them in! Yes, sir. Three Three Two Still Very comfortable One One Just an exiled prince, let's wait and see It's opened! Aha! It worked! See? Make way Let's go! Orders! Orders! Orders! Lunch calls! We've got food!

Go. Boss Xing Since we got him About the bounty... It is indeed Zhongshan's jade pedant Of course No one can survive three moves Under our boss It's strange If Zhongshan's dead Then why someone saw him on the broadway this morning？ Impossible I watched him fell off the cliff with my own eyes. I know you guys reasonably well Just some little gangs How could you possibly kill Zhongshan? You can't disavow our work The evidence is here I never disavow anything We had a deal Get me his head And I give you 22 pounds of gold With just the jade pendant Then you can have this Mister I can get the money tomorrow Can you do anything about it, please? How many times do I have to tell you? Money isn't the issue. Your sword was made With the most delicate iron from the Five Mountains And the best alloy from the realm Just go around the world There might be only a few who can help you with it. So there is someone who can After the best swordsmith Meng Yezi is killed Who else dares to cast swords So How about you sell it to me I can melt it And make some hoes Put it in a good value What do you think? Bear with it You can't be this impulsive anymore He was insulting us There's no way I'll take that What's more important? Your so-called dignity or your life? Both We can't find any odd jobs with the refugees now in town. I'd eat more in my dreams if I knew Hmph Maybe my anger Can feed me up "Here Lies My Dearest Father: Meng Yezi" Old man I'd trade my sword for twenty coins I give you thirty You can't sell it Let go It's your only hope for revenge I can't even kill a chicken with this damn sword Now talking about revenge? What could happen what after you sell it? Huh? Boss Have a pancake Luna Here you go where did it come from Boss Here comes our good life!

Up! 220 pounds of gold Half down payment Buy your men some decent outfit leave at once Meng Yang Did you feel anything strange? Yeah I haven't been this happy since forever!

Yes, yes I do You do? Then I can't have you anymore Send out a message Prince Du is on his way Yes sir. What a superb inn! We'll stay here tonight. Welcome, Your Highness. Your Highness Does it mean that he's... Prince Du? Why aren't you all be seating? Hey Your Highness We are all paupers How could we possibly be sitting with you? The country isn't one man's country And there's no high and low Besides, we're companions I see no reason that we can't sit together Okay, sit down now Come on Mister Meng May I take a look at your sword, please? Show it to His Highness I heard Your Highness is fond of swords I bet you can tell if it's a good one Influenced by what I saw and heard I guess I know a little The shape and weight is strong like a mountain Even though rusted, It's still a beautiful sword The swordsmith's mark You have never seen one? No Cheers Cheers Cheers Come on Meng Yang Cheers Meng Yang I know what you are about to say Relax I won't touch him I've heard Prince Du is a kind and wise man So different from his father Speak of today Indeed You go and tell everyone to pack We're leaving tonight Tonight? But Who's playing Qin this late? Go away! Away! Go away! There you go! You can kill me Spare the others I never had a living soul fled out of my hand Who are you The best assassin in the world White Rainbow Assassins Ji Wuliu Retreat Fire! Run! Hurry! Sister Luna Are you okay? You're bleeding Who is he? White Rainbow Assassins Ji Wuliu Thank you, everyone, for helping me No worries, it's our job You don't need to thank us, Your Highness People who can order about White Rainbow Must be a powerful man at high places Ordinary civilians like you are no match to him So please leave soon Your Highness You are the crowned Prince How dare they even lay hands on you? Exactly My father wants me to accede the throne Now they tried to kill me It's obvious someone doesn't want me back I wish you a safe journey back, farewell Your Highness... Meng Yang I'll escort His Highness tomorrow You need to take our guys back to the Red Town Why? You said Because I'm the boss Understand? You've seen it You guys can't deal with the assassins But Prince and I Can at least cover ourselves Be careful then Meng Yang You promised us That you'll protect us Forever Don't worry I'm a man of my word I believe you It has nothing to do with the job I just want to see the Palace These are all corpses of insurgent troops Some civil strife shit seems to me Which way should we take? The trail Lots of insurgents over that direction The person who wants me dead is much more murderous than insurgents I'll go change Kill. How do I look? Now you are a proper civilian One for you and one for you Someone lives here! Too bad! Sir The insurgents are here. Please hide quickly! Hurry! Go to the storage room. Take the horse! Sir, hurry! Come to the storage Hurry! Hurry! Quickly, please! Don't make a sound You go over there. Where are the people! Who else in the property? Just me and my son. Take him! Sir, My good sir, please spare me! Sir, no one else could take care of my son! Son! Daddy! Son! Get off! Son! Son! Daddy! My dear son! Don't cry Quickly! My dear Daddy It's okay, it's alright You are not coming back, are you? Silly boy When the willow tree is breeding sprouts. I'll be back Go! Wait! Take him! Daddy! Son! Daddy! Take good care of yourself! Daddy! Son! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Are you okay? Daddy! What are you doing? I'm going to save them! Save them? How? Kill those insurgents? Then you'll attract the whole troop here They'll not just be taken, they'll be dead What's your suggestion? You are the Prince, the future emperor They're all your people And you're just sitting here and watch? But the insurgents are my people as well! They want a good life, too. Violence can't solve all these problems But a peaceful world can Meng Yang Why do you think I'm heading back to the Palace? For the throne that everyone wants? I know the journey is a call of death But I need to do it For the people, and the world. Give out my order Summon the rest of our people Yes, sir! As a prince, why were you at the Red Town? My father sent out an order to burn the books and confiscate weapons I spoke against him, and he wasn't happy about it Then he sent me away Don't you find it strange? If he wants you to be his heir Why let someone like us do the job? People care about their reputations in the Palace If someone wants the throne and do not wish to be suspected Let me disappear quietly on the way back could be the best option Who is that person? Do you possibly know? I was away for too long And I don't see the situation in the Palace anymore You left me the jade? Of course to get you killed here Where does that sword come from? I was about to ask you the same question I can tell you Then shoot and cut the bullshit But first, you are going to tell me Where is Prince Du? Go to hell It might be the insurgent troops coming this way Retreat Boss! See? I know he's here! Meng Yang Boss please don't blame Sister Luna We insisted on coming Right? We had a deal that we'll die and live together We won't let you risk along Totally What the hell are you doing? Did you find out the answer? You were following me Huh? While it's dark Go back now! And after that? After that, we'll just starve and live like the old days? Still better than die! What's the difference between the past life and death? If we can help Prince Du to take back his throne Maybe we can change this world we can save people like us from starving! I don't want to starve I don't want to go back Neither do I That's what we want Go! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness We found you at last! Why are you here? You said we'll stay together, remember? And you ditched us Right You haven't eaten, right? I just had dinner, See? I saved you a... We've been through all the things together There's no way to separate a family like ours Wait, couldn't find the bite... Meng Yang Meng Yang Run! Run! Run Your Highness! Your Highness! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Move Dali! Dali! You go first! Dali! Go! No! Go! Go now! Go! Dali! No! I really want to have a bite now We can finally protect the boss Don't go... You let go of the Prince... Meng Yang Your Highness Are you alright? I'm sorry Qiongqi Dali Wonton I'm sorry They are outside Why don't you go out and save them! Meng Yang They don't want to see you like this What do they want? They are just a few orphans All they want is to live This is all your fault Your bullshit throne Your stupid peace They are all dead because of you I'm sorry Who's down there Go! Let's go and see! The insurgents... Let's go! Take them! Move! Let go of me! Move! Be quick! Behave yourself! Move! Get up! Move! Get over here! Move! What are you looking at? Behave yourself! Over there! Businessman? Yes We're from the Red Town Heading to the Palace for business We didn't expect a group of bandits on the way Sorry to disturb you There is chaos everywhere Why not go for the broadway Because Because The broadway Is crowded with greedy officials They'll rip us off We're all refugees You may rest here then Move They are from the outside I want to see the outside Quiet My dear Meng Yang It's all my fault I shouldn't have let you guys came along We'll head back to the Red Town tomorrow If we leave now Aren't they be dead for nothing? I haven't seen they act like that for my whole life Meng Yang You promised to protect us Now they are gone You need to finish what they haven't done What are you talking about? We aren't able - We aren't able to protect his throne Don't you know that from the beginning? Then what are you able to do? Still being a fraud? Or revenge for your father? Great I'll leave by myself You were asking for me? Getting any better? Thanks to your medication I'm almost recovered The Picking Osmund is quite damaged Many words are missing, I'm afraid? Long ago, when we set out, the willows spread their shade. Now, when we shall be returning, the snow will be falling clouds. Long and tedious will be our marching, we shall hunger, we shall thirst. Our hearts are stricken with sorrow, but no one listens to our plaint. These books were burnt by that fatuous ruler many years ago How could you possibly know the words? My father used to work in the royal library I had the honor to read a few books when I was little Those burnt books are now gone Such a shame Indeed However, if people who read them remember Even they were burnt They remain You are a brilliant man of knowledge Here, we are isolated from the war I'm wondering if you would stay And help me? If you use a sword like that There's no necessity for revenge You can go home now Go away Leave me alone You can't get grip of the sword Why? Because you don't believe in it That's why it's not fast enough Are you laughing at me? Blunt like this What can it do? It's not the sword that's blunt It's your heart You don't believe in your sword How come it has any power Don't give me those talks The sword is unfinished It can do nothing Always someone else's fault. Your faith should be sharper than the sword And stronger Remember The true strength isn't about taking lives But saving lives I believe in you so much How can you not believe in yourself? We gonna need some tools If we want to go up I saw someone came down from up there yesterday There must be a way Isn't it a little bit rude to leave without saying goodbye? What an honor, Your Highness Oops, it just crossed my mind that We are insurgents! Take them General Chen What is it about? Raise your royal head and look around Their families friends All dead in the bloody hands of your father They run for their lives And hide underground where they don't see the light of the day Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Wait! Burn him alive! My buddies are all dead because of him I want to set the fire myself Meng Yang you - Fine I give you the opportunity No tricks Let go of him Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! Burn him alive! My buddies They are orphans They are timider and weaker than me World peace? They don't know what that means. But they do know that killing and running away won't save the troubled world The person you are going to kill is a humane and wise heir to the throne is the only hope to change the world The flowers are bloomed and the skies are blue Don't you want to go up and see them? I do My lady? You - We escaped from the burnt village and has been hiding the Red Town They gave us food when we were starving Thanks to them we are alive I saved you the other half Thank you Let him go Follow the east river You'll find a way to the Palace Thank you But remember If you can't make a good emperor I'll break in the Palace and kill you If I can I hope you can lead them out I failed to take Prince Du's head I'm leaving The White Rainbow Assassins said Never go against destiny or cheat one's will I'm out of the game And no one can stop me How dare you! How dare you! I never want to see this treacherous gangster anymore! Did you find out the answer? You knew I did, when we were at the inn And I guess Ji Wuliu's Sword of Light was cast by your father, too My father told me I can revenge for him When the sword is ultimately casted I spent twelve years and did everything I can but still... I can see nothing special from this sword except reining Sword of Light Maybe your father meant something else Maybe Thank you For what you said in the cave You owe me a few lives of my brothers You will not die easily The light of thy is brighter than the sword You have many people risk their lives for thy Maybe You are the destiny There is a dangerous road lying ahead of thy Take care That is the Palace in front of us Finally We'll drink when we get there! We will Let's go. It's okay They are here to lead the way How dare you to follow me all the way to the Palace Not exactly Zhao Han It's you Lord Protector Zhao Han A dog of the emperor Well, having been a dog for so many years Now it's time for me to be a man How dare you to assassin the Prince Right near the Palace You're going to die Just not today Oh, you're the son of Meng Yezi I remember I killed your whole family How come you are alive Go! Meng Yang I couldn't remember when's the last time I'm sitting here with you for a sunset You won't forget about me Right? Meng Yang You promised us that you'll protect us Forever Don't worry I'm a man of my word Father Father Zhao Han! Your Majesty Your Majesty? Time to die Father Father Father Prince Du killed his Majesty for the throne, here ended his reign Take your time No hurry For a better world For a better world Your Highness Please don't make mistakes again, Your Highness Don't make mistakes again Turn around It's you I didn't expect to see you here at piles of corpses Who killed them Zhao Han's troops It's time for your revenge When the sword is ultimately casted Master Meng knows Zhao Han holds great powers He said that because he doesn't want you to be bond to vengeance Now I understand But it's too late Master Meng once said White is hard Yellow is tenacious A mixture of the two will be hard and tenacious That makes a good sword What does that mean? Go ask him then My time has come to an end Yet I haven't finished the sword It's time to revenge for me When the sword is ultimately cast Father Come- Go! Zhao Han Who really wants me dead? His Majesty, or you? There's nothing more to be said Meng Yang, did you find out the answer? Father? Sword of Shadow reins Sword of Light to protect you But the key to unleashing its real power are you Me? Besides strength You need a good heart, to protect other people and the world Sword of Shadow rise from your blood When your will connects with the soul of it You will understand Never forget You are a Meng Never forget Your responsibility Prince Du Killed His Majesty for the throne The sin is no way to be forgiven To make the justice and reinforce the rules He shall be beheaded in public One man violates the law I'll kill that man One city violates the law I'll slaughter that city Aren't we said that if the Prince violates the law, he must be punished like an ordinary people Who else Dares to violate my law! Me! Is that guy stupid? You came alone I am a little loath to kill you Alone? Over my back I present to you the whole world! Someone told me It's not a sword that can fix the troubled world It's your faith Now I'm going to save him And he will save the whole world! Kill him! Do you really think the world will remember you? It's me who they remember! Sword of Shadow reins Sword of Light to protect you But the key to unleashing its real power are you Meng Yang You can do it As a swordsmith from House of Meng Go reach your peak of perfection! Throne... mine... The throne has never been yours to sit on The outside The world Are waiting for you So are we gonna fight or not? Prince is here! Your Highness! Meng Yang Thank you for taking back the world for me Sifu There's someone here to see you Sifu? What for? He said for a drink.
