I seek the man who killed my friend CEMETERY WITHOUT CROSSES And when we meet my life may end My life depends upon my gun And my gun spells hope in the land Where the rope And the colt are king I swore a vow on my dyin' breath To ride a trail that ends in death And death could strike With a frightening jolt of a lightning bolt In the land where the rope And the colt are king But oh my darlin' if I should die There's not a soul who will ever know That I loved you so was the reason why The days are dust and the nights are black But oh my darlin' if I get back I'll trade my gun for a weddin' ring and I'll turn my hand to the land Where the rope and the colt are king Maria. Maria! Ben! No! Leave him alone! Ben! Ben! Leave him alone. Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Come on, men. I want the other two Caines, let's go. We couldn't get the herd. The Rogers already sold it. But at least we got the money. They burned the place to the ground and killed the stock. Nothing left. And I'm not going back. I'm through with farming. We'll be leaving tomorrow. Rogers have been trying for years to get hold of the Caine land. Now they done it. We'll spend the night here and... then cross the border. It'll be safer there. Wait a minute. That livestock was all we had. We couldn't let them get away with all that money. All right, so he's dead, but you can't blame us. That's your money. What are you doing here? They killed Ben. - Who killed him? - Rogers. They shot him, but he got away. They followed Ben. As soon as they found him at home, they hanged him. - They made me watch. - I told him he should have gone away. Nobody frightened Ben. And now he's dead. I don't want 'em to go free. I need someone. You believe in revenge, but I don't. It never ends. - Ben was your friend. - Go ask his brothers. They're cowards. Help me. I can't help you. Well, I suppose I've got to do it all alone. - That's right. - Then you won't. Doesn't interest me. Maybe you're willing to do it for a price. Don't bother to bring it up. You're wasting time. I already brought it up. This is what Ben got back from the Rogers. I'm through with fighting. Not even for me? Not even for you. You were my last hope. There's only myself now. They'll kill you. Let 'em then. Get out while there's still time. - You wanna room? - Yeah. Sign the book. A dollar for the room and 50 cents more if you take a lass. - Get out of here. - My money? Go to hell! You promised. - Get off my back. Pay me the money now. That's all you're gettin'. Get outta here. Scumbag! His old man and all his brothers are all bastards. Come on. I'll take you to your room. I'll make him pay for this. I'll get him. Go on now. I don't want trouble with the Rogers. Nothing to it once you know what you're doing. All you have to have is luck. Buy me a drink? You're new in town. I saw you over at the hotel. OK, where is he? Better watch him. He's the one with the red shirt and the ghoul face. I can handle him. Think so? Half his family's sitting there. Get out first. - Sam. - Yeah? Keep your hands on the table. On the table. On your feet. All right, let's go. Now listen to me, amigo. Maybe you think you can do anything you want 'cause you're a Rogers. We'd like to know. Now you tell us. You think you folks are special, right? You've been very lucky, boy, and that's a fact. You didn't end up like the Caines. The Rogers family lives in a different world. You folks ain't bad men. Maybe you kill a fella now and then, scare people here a bit. They ain't at all like me. They're willing to wait and pray you all die off. But I don't want to wait. We Vallees ain't too patient. We ain't waiting till you rustle our cattle, burn our farms, just 'cause other folks are afraid of you. So we're running you out of town. You're leaving. You're gonna go, and now. So now you know. You're going to find we do all right, us Vallees. You'll find out. If you don't believe we're tough enough, I'll show you a sample. Hope you know what you're doin'. If I were you... But you ain't. Stone. Can you tell me who he is? No idea, but he's the kind I really wouldn't want to know. Open up or we'll bust the door down. You're wanted for murder. Come on. - Brought you a little note. - Pa sent it. Think you ought to read it. Tell your pa I won't release him. Four men have been shot. In self-defence. My friend, we were both there. - We were witnesses. - Then you ought to know who he is. Sure. He works for us. Let him go. My brothers and I'll take care of him. We figured this will leave you free to look for the Caines. My men are searching. All right. Just remember this. We pay you good money and we want action. You gonna do what he says? What about it? Wake up. You're free till next time. Have you worked long for them Rogers? Hurry up. Let's go. Ain't gonna be this lucky next time. OK, let's go. - Thanks, sheriff. - And don't forget the Caines. Here he is, Pa. Come closer. My sons told me all about you. I expect you know I'm much obliged. What is it that we can do for you? - Not much. - A job? - What have you got? - You're new around these parts. Hey? That's right. I am. The man doesn't like questions at all! Well, that suits me. What's your name? Manuel. I've got a good steady job for you as my foreman. 22 dollars plus food and lodging. That do? - That's fine. - Bud, put him in with you and George. Diana, this is Manuel. He's going to be our new foreman. Come on. - Pa, we spoke to the sheriff. - And? - What do we do now? - I don't know. Can't stay here. It's dangerous. She can always join us later. I'll go see. - Well, what you gonna do? - I'll stay here. Listen, we can't wait any longer. We're going tonight. You can do as you like, but I wish you'd stay on a day or two. Will you? Because I'd be alone if you go. Tom, look! Let's go. For the blessings we're about to receive, oh Lord, make us truly grateful. Amen. You've got to pull it harder. Harder! You see, that's gonna hold! Get your dirty feet off of my bed! - Looking for something, friend? - Can't I look around if I want? Yeah, but the boss don't like anyone hanging around his horses after dark. I see. - I haven't met you. - My name's Corey. - You're the new foreman? - That's right. It's not up to me, you know. I just carry out orders. Fine. It's all right. I'm turning in. OK. Goodnight. Hey, come on! Hey! Hold up! You circle round to the left. Larry, you go with him. Frank, come with me! Hurry! Get a move on! Come on! Let's go! All right, last time around. Get your bets down! That's it! Here it comes! Gather round. Yeah! I got it! - Somebody opened the gate. - You say that one more time, - I'll bust your head in. - At least we got everything back. Not everything. What are you doing here? Frank! Anything you want is yours. How much are you willing to do for her? Pa. - What do you want? - Not money. Money's unimportant now. If you cherish your only daughter, you'll do exactly as I say, whatever I tell you. If I say the word, she's finished. Is that clear? Three men of mine ain't come back yet. They went out after the Caines. We got some huntin' to do. What's she doing here? This is our affair, Sheriff. - Better go, Mrs Caine. - Do you want to tell me about this? - What did she want? - Pa! She can't get away with it. What happened? Did you see him? - It'll all turn out fine. - How do we know that? Could be a trick. - Why? They'll pay the price. - How much? They're coming back to get him. - Then I'll finish this. - Coming back to get who? - Ben. - Ben? He's dead and buried! There ain't nothing more you can do for him. The Rogers will pray for his soul. The people have got to see what they've done to Ben. I've waited for this, hoping... ...that they'd have to honour him, kneel down before God, as humiliated men. You're out of your mind, girl! You had no right! You should have asked us first. - We would never have let you. - Leave her alone. Come on. It's not safe in this place. It's time I started worrying about me. Right now, we're gonna get us a ticket to Mexico. All flesh is grass and all men will die. Look upon us with mercy and make Thy people children of life. Oh, wash away all our sins. Thine enemies fall down before the outstretched arm of the Lord. All those that hate Thee are destroyed. Thou causeth the earth to swallow them and the fire to consume them. My body cries out, "Absolve us!" My heart is split open wide. Listen and bring me solace. Save me. Let my soul fly to Thee and find eternal rest. It is written, "To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose. "A time to be born and a time to die." And so be it. "Vanity, vanity!" saith the preacher. "All is vanity." What's the matter, Manuel? About to lose your little girl? We were coming to talk to you about that. She's going to get us across the border. Listen, Maria said to come and get her. And that's what we're gonna do. All right, where is she? Talk. Come on, talk! You gonna start talkin'? 2,000 dollars to get her back. - Talk, will you? - Your brother will die if you don't. You'll never see her if you lay a hand on my brother. How do you know she's alive, eh? If she weren't, we'd be in Mexico by now. Believe me. - You'd better get her back here. - If we don't get back tonight... - they'll kill her. - Leave him to me, Pa. That's sufficient. Well, there you are. Bring her back here. You're starting to use your head! Frank! You ought to try to be nicer to me, man. And my little brother. We'll just take this. Eli, come on. We'll bring back your daughter, Rogers. Don't worry. No, you're going to get her. Your brother's staying here with us. If by 11 o'clock she ain't back here, you know what to expect. Thomas! Take it easy, Eli. We've got the cash and the girl. It'll be all right. - Well, then? - It's a deal. Eli stays with you. I don't want to meet you at the ranch. It's not that I don't trust you. Let's meet in town instead. It's a bit closer to the border. OK by me. We'll see you at 11 at the church. My gun. Thomas! I ain't gonna let you down, Eli. Nothin' to worry about. Caine? Keep track of the time. They're bringing my daughter in a few minutes. We can't afford mistakes. Get ready. What are you gonna do now? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter to me what I do. You'd better not stay here. The Rogers can only mean trouble. It has no meaning for me now. I just don't care. I fear nothing, Manuel. I've finished having any feeling. I did what I had to. There's no more now. Go home now. Tomorrow, I'll get you at sun-up. I'll take you north. Do you still remember? Manuel will take you home. We don't need you. Not any more. I never intended to make you suffer. My brothers will kill you. Thomas! Are you gonna tell us who did it? You'd better tell us or you're not gonna live long. Manuel. He did it. - Who? - Manuel. And where have they brought Diana? Ghost town. Let's go. Let's go. Maria. Manuel. The Rogers... did you take her back? Yes. - What about you? - I'm all right. Her brothers think you murdered her. Eli talked. Watch out. They'll find you. They'll find you, Manuel. - Not me. - We could have gone away. We could have... but now it's too late. No, there's still time. We'll begin again. We'll go north to a place I know of, don't worry. No, Manuel. You've got to leave. - They'll be back. - You're coming with me. I'm not. If you want, you can come back for me. I'll stay here. If I stay... ...you can make it through. I remember when you first went away. I shouldn't have married Ben. But you... ...you never did come back. Ben? Did I do right?
