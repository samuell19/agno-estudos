SERGEANT: Come on! Run! Come over here. Move it! Let's see something from you. Up, up, up, up. [SOLDIERS YELLING] Jump! Right. Go on. Keith, find Captain Johns. If he's set, tell him to send lieutenant Flynn to take the airport. -[EXPLOSION] -[GLASS SHATTERS] [COCKS GUN] Back that jeep out of here. Take cover. [GUNFIRE] Take cover. [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Rafer, come on, come on. Allen, kill me. For God's sake kill me! No, no, I can't. I can't. [FIRING] [BELL TOLLING] I understand precisely what you're saying, Mr. McCann. [STAMMERS] I do. -But, I think that... -McCANN: Don't "but" me. Now, why the hell do you think I put you in charge of our European office? Because I expect you to do the impossible when I think it's to our benefit. We're moving much too quickly on this, sir. Moving too quickly? The man is practically 90 years old for Christ's sake. He could die while you and I are talking. Mr. McCann, just attempting this sort of thing, I mean, whether we are successful or not, could cause international repercussions. I don't give a damn. I know how dangerous it'll be. But if we have one shot in a million, we've got to take it. If we pull this off, it makes Watergate look like kid's stuff. Listen, that old man knows about secret deals that could blast half the civilized world apart. I want him and I don't care how much it costs. If we succeed, our network is going to write a whole new chapter in the history of the world, and that's everything. If we fail... Well, listen you tried, and we'll make it a goddamned good story out of that, too. Now I understand you've got the best mercenary available. Yes. He's here waiting in reception. His name's Alex Faulkner. Well, get him in and talk to him. And get Kathy in there, too. I want her comments. And leave your box open, I want to hear the conversation. I won't say anything. Bring Mr. Faulkner in right away and get Kathy up here, okay? [INTERCOM BUZZES] Yes? WOMAN: Miss Lukas, Mr. Faulkner's here. Would you come up, please? Okay, right away. This is Mr. Faulkner. How do you do? Michael Lukas. How do you do? Uh, Kathy. Kathy, this is Alex Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner, this is Kathy Lukas. How do you do, Mr. Faulkner? How nice to meet you. You're both Lukases, are you? Oh, I'm Michael's sister. This network is riddled with nepotism. That's the nature of networks. Please, have a seat. -Uh, coffee, tea? -No, nothing at all, thanks. Whiskey'd be fine. Oh, how do you drink it? Just straight, thanks. So, why are you interested in an antique mercenary? Planning a new series? I'm available if you are. -No, it's nothing quite like that. -Thanks. Kathy's patched together some tape that we'd like for you to look at, Mr. Faulkner, and after that we'll discuss it. That'd be fine with me. [CLEARS THROAT] ANNOUNCER ON TV: This man is Rudolf Hess, a strange and controversial figure in the Nazi party before and during World War II. Today, approaching 90, he is a prisoner at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. His life, a mystery. Hess was one of the founders of the Nazi party. He eventually became Hitler's deputyFuhrer, second only to Hitler in the Nazi hierarchy. May, 1941, with the war in Europe very much in Germany's favor, Hess flew alone from Germany and parachuted from his plane over Scotland. His mission, to offer himself as hostage in return for peace talks with British leaders. To this day, it is not known whether Hess undertook this mission on his own without Hitler's knowledge, or whether if he and Hitler planned it together... You know, I'm well acquainted with all this. I understand. It's just to refresh your memory. ...until the war ended. Nurnberg, 1946, Hess was put on trial with the other captured German leaders. Russian, French, British and American prosecutors tried what was left of the German hierarchy for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Most of the German leaders were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, or to long prison terms. Hess was acquitted of crimes against humanity, but sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to wage war. -Nein -Oh. -To this day... -You know it's nearly impossible to count the number of people who conspired to wage war in the last 40 years, or how many wars they've started. I'm damned if I know of one who went to prison for it. Spandau Prison, Berlin, 1982. Now, nearly 90 years old, Hess has been in solitary confinement in a prison cell for over 40 years, most of those years spent in Spandau prison. He's now the only inmate in a fortress built to hold 600 prisoners. I think that's enough for our purposes, I mean, unless you'd care to see more. No thanks. Forty years alone in a cell! I suppose if it weren't Hess, I should be inclined to say the poor bastard. He's nothing but a political pawn now. Hmm. So, ball in your court. What do you want to see me about? With price no object, Mr. Faulkner... MICHAEL: We'd like you to get Hess out of Spandau and deliver him to us. Am I supposed to laugh? You are joking, of course. No, we're not, Mr. Faulkner. The idea is just about the most insane bit of work that I've ever been offered. -Why on earth do you want him? -KATHY: To make news. To expose a lot of very important people who were probably involved in making some strange deals. You know, it would to take a bloody army even to try to get him out of Spandau. Suppose you did. What then? You're on West Berlin. You're right in the middle of East Germany. You'd have a war on your hands. I am sorry, but, that is just a touch out of my range. No, I... I think you're probably confusing me with my elder brother, Allen. -No, but we heard about his death. -Mmm-hmm. Very sorry. Yes. Well, thanks. But, you know, I doubt if even he would have taken this on. Just the thought of organizing it exhausts me. Our last trip to Africa ended in a blood bath, compared to what you're suggesting, it was a school picnic. You have any idea what you're up against in Berlin? Some, yes, but we've been told that you're the best in the business. Thank you very much for your hospitality. Mr. Faulkner, I've told you that price is no object. I'm sorry. The answer's no. Maybe when I was a good deal fitter and somewhat crazier. [CLICKS TONGUE] Ah! Fitter and crazier. Well, I wonder if this might help. I do know a chap who might just be insane enough to be interested and he's just as good as ever I was. He's probably better. Matter of fact, I think he's here in London at the moment. [CLICKS] [WATER DRIPPING] Rudolf Hess is the most closely guarded man in the world. Yes, he is, but I would think the challenge would appeal to you, Mr. Haddad. Have you ever been to Berlin? No. I think you'll find it a fascinating city. This is everything I can find on Hess and Spandau, plus the military procedures of the four powers used to guard him. There's also a significant amount of expense money in there and a ticket to Berlin on the two o'clock flight tomorrow. I don't recall saying I'd do this at all. You haven't, but I expect you will. I have appointments tomorrow. -Cancel them. -You're a very irritating woman, Miss Lukas. If it would make you feel more comfortable, Mr. Haddad, I can be all sweetness and light. No, I think I prefer irritating. Okay. Now, Mr. Haddad, we're very anxious to get started, so straight out, will you accept this assignment? I never take a job unless I have a reasonable chance to succeed. That's very sensible. It's the reason for your going to Berlin tomorrow to see Spandau for yourself. Let's say I do, if I decide to go ahead with it after I've seen Spandau, I'll work my own way without interference, I'll get the money I want, the price will be high, and no bargaining, none at all. -How about it? -That's just fine. We want the man, Mr. Haddad. We're not worried about money. Excellent! Since we're all being listened into, I assume, by your superior, I believe you. -Is that right? -McCANN: Yes, it is. Ah, good luck, Mr. Haddad. Thank you. All right. Berlin tomorrow. I'll be there the day after. You're full of surprises. Give me a number where I can reach you. It's also in the envelope. [SCOFFS] Your self-confidence is overwhelming. Oh, one small point. When you come to Berlin, you'll be entering my world. I don't think you have any real idea what that's like. You may regret it. Or you may not live to regret it at all. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT] You're in West Berlin for business or for pleasure? [IN FRENCH ACCENT] For business, monsieur. -For how long? -Uh, perhaps, one month. -MAN: Passport EC5... -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] Let him through. We'll take the responsibility. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT] [CAMERA CLICKS] -[ENGINE ROARS] -[CONTINUES CLICKING] [SIREN WAILING] [SIGHS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] Most people I know generally say hello. We did that on the phone. All right! We ration greetings. It may take me a while to learn how you operate. Isn't this an odd place to pick for a meeting? Yeah, I always wanted to run in the stadium where Jesse Owens stuck it to Hitler. Well, good. Now that you've done that, I'll select our meeting places. What have you seen of Berlin so far? I thought we were here to discuss business. Oh, and no idle chatter. I may be getting the hang of it. Tell me, how's business? I've seen the outside of Spandau. I know the guard routine, of the Americans anyway. So what's next? I have to find a way to see the inside of Spandau. -Which won't be easy. -Which may be impossible. With a man like you, surely nothing is impossible. [SIGHS] Look, I'm sorry. Why don't we start this whole relationship all over again before it becomes a real problem, okay? I don't see any problem at all. All right, no problem. Now, I'd like to know where you're staying in Berlin. I move every day. I'll be in touch with you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] OFFICER: Right, follow us. Quick march. Left, right, left, right, left, right. Halt! Left, right. Halt! [ENGINE STARTS] Oye, pull over. [MILITARY MARCH] OFFICER: Halt! Left, right, left, right, left. Halt! Left, right, halt! Left, right, halt! Halt! Fall out! Guard. Get away. [DOOR SHUTS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SIGHS] Hello, liebchen. Sorry, I'm not buying. Oh, you just wouldn't believe the kind of time I can show you. Oh, I believe it. You've got to be the second best piece of ass in Berlin, but my wife... -She's the first. -Aw. -Nice meeting you. -Listen... Listen... Let me give you my card, for when she starts getting headaches. Move. Schnell! Schnell! Ah! [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [GROANS] [TIRES SCREECH] [GROANING] Welcome to Berlin, Mr. Haddad. -Who are you? -I ask the questions. Why are you in Berlin? [GRUNTS] We can continue to do this all night, but it's such a waste of time. Now, tell me. Why are you in Berlin? How... How do you know my name? You are being modest. [CHUCKLES] A man who hurt Palestinian commander units in Lebanon so badly that they have a very attractive price on this head. Let's not play games. This is our city. We like to know what goes on here. Then read the fucking newspapers. [CHUCKLES] Let me help you. You have been seen studying Spandau. You are interested in Hess, am I correct? As I said, we have time. [GRUNTS] Before you become unconscious again, you are interested in Hess? [GASPING] Who gave you the contract? Americans. Television network. You knew that, didn't you? And you were to rescue Hess? I was just seeing if that could be done. And in your esteemed opinion, Mr. Haddad, can it? No. No. And you know how many men have investigated that idea and found it impossible, including me? Well, it doesn't matter. Let me explain your position to you. Your Palestinian friends have been good to us and it will please us to do them a favor. [GRUNTS] [GUNFIRE] [HORN BLARING] -[SIREN WAILING] -[TIRES SCREECHING] Good morning, Mr. Haddad. I am Colonel Reed-Henry. Reed-Henry is hyphenated. Somehow my mother's maiden name wandered in there. [CHUCKLES] Never mind. My God, you do look bloody awful. How are you feeling? Surprised. Ah, yes. Hmm. You were in our sector of Berlin when you were found last night. Strange business. Thought I'd better pop over, see what happened. Incidentally, the doctor says you're a lucky man. Nothing broken, just a mild concussion. I expect you've got a smashing headache. Yeah, I have. Tell me. Are colonels always in the habit of just popping over to visit injured tourists? It was on my way. I've seen the police reports. Hand cuffs and shooting and all that nasty stuff. And you say you know nothing about it or who did it. No, I'm sorry. See if you can recognize any of these. No. That's Heinrich Stroebling. Used to be a Gehlen Organization man. Very right wing. Now, he works for the Soviets in East Germany. He's in charge of organizing and equipping urban terror groups all over the world. Vicious bastard, so they tell me. Well, I won't keep you. We know who you are, Mr. Haddad. Would you like to tell me what you're doing here? No. I suppose not. Good day. Oh, my God! What happened to you? Somebody tried to kill me. Kill you? Yeah. Who? I'm not sure. I've got to get away for a while. If I'm gonna work here, I need a man at my back. Have you a particular man in mind? Yeah, his name's Alex Faulkner. [GROANS] Ah, Jesus. He's working in Munich right now. Faulkner? Yes, Faulkner turned us down in this. [SCOFFS] Well, he's a sensible man. I may do the same. Until I decide, I need help, and he's the best man I know. And do we have to pay him? Price is no object, Miss Lukas, correct? Why yes, of course. Good. After I've reached him, you make your deal with him. I'll be away until then. Where are you going? Um. Somewhere near here. Ah, yes. Bavaria. Yeah. I know a lovely little inn right outside of Munich. I'll take you there. I don't need company. I understand, but I need you alive. Besides, a married couple on a holiday wouldn't attract much attention, would we? Yes, I know it's dangerous, Hassan, but I need this. HASSAN: I'll contact him right away. Tell him I'm only two hours away. Ring me back. Ask for Louis Dubois. What are you reading? A letter Hess wrote to his wife in 1962. "After so many years in jail, "I understand why the Chinese, when fate has been kind to them, "go to the market to buy captive birds to set them free." Oh, that's touching. Touching? It's interesting. I never knew the Chinese did that. I don't give a damn about Hess. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. HASSAN: I've got Faulkner for you. [SIGHS] Yes, thank you. Faulkner's in. He'll meet us here. [GUNSHOT] Good morning. [BREATHES HEAVILY] Morning. I thought maybe you'd like to have some company, which probably you won't. So, I thought maybe I would like to have some company. For conversation's sake, ah, which probably you won't like either. Uh, you were brought up in Lebanon. Did you go to college there? I wasn't really brought up there. I was born and raised in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. My dad's family were all Lebanese. And when I graduated from high school, we all moved over there. And yeah I, I went to the American University in Beirut. Ah, and what did you study? HADDAD: Pre-med. KATHY: Did you go to medical school? HADDAD: Yeah. KATHY: And? And nothing. I just left. Why? I notice that you wear a wedding band. Are you married? Yeah, I was. So, you're divorced now? My wife and our 3-year-old daughter were shot dead in a village south of Beirut. And my mother. And my father. And I went to war and death ate its way into me... And it never left. I'm so sorry. [CLICKS] [GUNSHOT] Get down! Get down! [GROANS] [BIRDS TWITTERING FRANTICALLY] Guten Morgen. It's all right. It's all right. [GASPS] [SOBS] Oh, shit! I... I had seen the inside of the Spandau courtyard and there's only one weak spot. The smuts barracks. If I could get in there with some men and over the wall, then what? Oh, damn! Here, let me do that. Let me help you. Let me see. I mean, I don't know what cell he's kept in, whether they move him from cell to cell, uh, whether they rotate the guards, how many guards there are. But, all right, I find him. That's just the beginning. How do I get an 89-year-old man out of there and out of Berlin? -You can't... -Shh, stand still... -Okay, okay, okay... -Stay still, stay still. You can't bribe an entire army, can you? Four armies. No, I can't. Then there's the Berlin police. Shh! FAULKNER: For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings. [KATHY SCREAMS] That then I scorn to change my state with kings. You bastard. Well, I never! I crown your love making with a Shakespearean sonnet and all you can do is make nasty remarks about my parents. I feel deeply wounded. Alex, you're a genuine madman. No question about that. What bothers me is it's the only Shakespeare sonnet that I can remember. So much for a good education. Get out! John, are you going to let him stand there? My, aren't you splendid? How the hell did you get in here? Now John, you should know better than to ask me a thing like that. I have my devilish ways. KATHY: I can't believe this. Please, get him out. I assure you I mean well. Don't I, John? Yeah, generally he means well. He was watching us. -You are sick. -I know. But I'm sure you'd sympathize if you knew what hell it is living the life of a voyeur. -[CORK POPS] -[CHUCKLES] You look as if someone had dropped you through a shredder... [HADDAD CHUCKLES] Bloody inconsiderate. Anyone for refreshment? May I call you Kathy? [LAUGHS] Of course, given enough money, I could equip a regiment in this town. Anyway that should do you. Thank you. [GRUNTS] What is it? What's wrong? [GROANS] Oh, it's nothing. I was once bitten by the wrong kind of mosquito. Every now and again the brute will insist that I remember the occasion. -It's just a touch of malaria. -[COCKS GUN] I never knew about that. Ah, it's not a big problem. Pills take care of it. Tell me, Alex, how'd you get the leg? Oh, well, that was a truly romantic adventure. Yes, now, where was I? Angola? Namibia? No, Kensington High Street in London. I was on my way to a chamber music concert there and I was run into by a motorbike. Yes. Broke it in four places. Still, it makes me look rather interesting, don't you think so? -[COCKS GUN] -No. You watch me, John. I'll hobble faster than you can walk. And what comes next? Find us some safe houses, then drop out of sight and watch my back. My dear John, I consider the responsibility of keeping you alive to be an act of faith, of love and, indeed, of friendship. And as I happen to be independently bankrupt, a financial necessity as well. [CAR DOOR OPENS] John, British Army car just pulled up. Fellow dressed like a soldier. He's just got out. I've got about 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six... HADDAD: Let him come. That'd be brilliant, hitting a soldier on the doorstep. Just keeping you informed. Leave your radio on. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Mr. Haddad? Yes. Colonel Reed-Henry extends his compliments and would like you to join him. -Now? -Yes, sir. It's what you might call an evening on the town. He thinks you'll enjoy it. If you don't mind, sir, I consider it advisable. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL SINGING IN GERMAN] [MAN IN CROWD WHISTLES] Oh, there you are. On your way, my girl, on your way. Just be a few minutes. Lovely, isn't it? -Germans make vulgarity an art. Can I buy you a drink? -No, thank you. -Tell me why I'm here. -Good, straight to the point. We can talk freely here. This place is too noisy to bug. Rare even for Berlin! Remarkable, the people you run into in this place. That general is the governor of the Russian sector. Now, I understand you want to get Hess out of Spandau? -Is that a serious question? -Quite serious. You won't manage it, no one could. Incidentally, that was Stroebling who picked you up, wasn't it? -Yes. -Why? Something to do with a Palestinian group. Well, Mr. Haddad, I might be prepared to help you with this. Now why would you want to do that? The presence of Hess in Spandau is one of several reasons which gives the Russians the right to station troops in the British sector. We don't want that situation. We try to make life as difficult as we can. [CHUCKLES] And the man simply refuses to die. Obviously, we can't free Hess just like that with 20 million Russian dead in the war, the political repercussions would be tremendous. But if someone like you could manage it, that would be quite different. Providing, of course, it's not the British Army's turn to do guard duty. The French take over from the Americans next week, -time presses, I assume? -More or less. I understand that no matter which army guards Spandau, one of Hess's personal wardens -is always British, is that true? -Yes. And now you are about to ask if I'm so bloody anxious to get Hess out of Berlin that I'd even talk to you about it, why don't I just have him poisoned or something and be done with it? Answer? The rules require an autopsy at which all four powers must be represented. I'd be caught, wouldn't I? [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hess is due for a medical check-up tomorrow. Whenever that's necessary, he's taken by military convoy to the British Military Hospital in Dickensweg. In my opinion, that's the one weak link in the entire security net. Now if you could manage to be at the East Gate of Spandau at 10:00 in the morning. One thing. I must approve each step you take in advance. You can reach me there. -[CROWD CHEERING] -[APPLAUSE] It might just work. I almost wish it wouldn't. -Thinking about it though, you know I... -Kathy. Yeah? I'm not the reason you're here. Yes, I know. I'm accepting your contract. Isn't there a less impersonal way of saying that? No. I guess I'm supposed to ask you your price, huh? It's all expenses payable as I need them plus 400,000 American dollars, half in a Swiss bank now, the other half when I deliver Hess to you. Okay, done. What are we supposed to do now? Shake hands? FAULKNER: [OVER RADIO] John? Yeah? There's a really disgusting looking character standing under a tree a block down to your right. Take a look at him. Yeah, I see him. We've met before. Okay, now look to your left. There's another revolting creature. Got him. I don't know if they're here to pick me up or kill me. But I want them stopped. What, now? Yeah, now. Oh, lovely. We aim to please. Now look, there's a little courtyard, it's in the Turkish Quarter. I think you'd better write this down. One eight eight, Oraneanstrasse. I don't know where you are Alex, but there are four of them. One's in a black Ford. -One of them's a woman. -FAULKNER: I've seen them. Just keep moving. I don't know why they haven't made their move. The driver keeps calling in, I guess for instructions. Alex, where the hell are you? Come in. WOMAN: Halt! Halt! [SNIPER SHOTS] FAULKNER: Now I'd call that perfection. Two for me, one for you. Thanks a lot, Colonel. Why didn't you say something? Now you know I don't talk when I'm working. It breaks my concentration. If it is ever... Ah! Your friends are all dead. Do you understand? You're not. Only because you're taking this to Stroebling. -Ugh. -Wear this for a while. [MAN GROANS] REED-HENRY: An accident off Heerstrasse. I'd guess that's the most likely place. HADDAD: I'll need some help. REED-HENRY: Such as? HADDAD: Access to a warden at Spandau. Someone close to Hess. Oh, I can handle that. My men are going to impersonate a unit of British Military Police. -We'll need to be properly trained and equipped. -That, too. I'm going to substitute a body for Hess. How much time have I got before the autopsy? Mmm. Possibly two hours before they all get to the hospital. I understand your problem getting him out of Berlin. Now if you can break Hess from the convoy, British Intelligence will do that. I can guarantee you. Where will you take him? You and I will settle that another time. Now I understand you've had another run-in with Stroebling? Now German police are quite upset. That was unavoidable. Now if you could do something about Stroebling... No, I can't. You're on your own. Stroebling's given us hell for years, but his ties to the terror groups are absolutely secure. And he refuses to retire. We enjoy that situation. I can't let you kill him. As for him killing you, you keep me informed. [BIKE REVVING] [DINGING] [SCREAMS] [CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING] That's our man. Let's go meet him. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [HORN HONKING] Come on, get in. I'd feel easier if we were both on the street. STROEBLING: I see you have found some friends. HADDAD: A few. You said you have something to offer me. What is it? I'm tired of having your men come after me. You've lost three so far. I promise you there'll be more. Mr. Haddad, I don't intend to risk my people on you any further. I understand that the Palestinians just missed you in London recently. I have already let them know you're here. They will handle it. -You're gonna call them off. -Am I? Why? I've found a way to kidnap Hess. If that were so, I would want him very much indeed. And I'm prepared to give him to you. But you are still working for your American group, aren't you? Why this sudden change of loyalty? When it comes to my survival, I work for myself. -So we bargain. -We do. First, I want a free run in Berlin. No interference from you, or anyone you control. Second. If I guarantee to deliver Hess to you alive, I want the Palestinian price on me lifted permanently. Your life for Hess. That seems fair. When would I get him? A few weeks at the most. -I don't suppose you want to tell me how it can be done? -No. -Or where you can deliver him to me? -Not yet. Do we have a deal? We do. When Hess is delivered, I'll arrange to have the price on you lifted. No. I want that now. If I don't deliver Hess, and I'm still alive, -send them after me again. -Done. -How do I know that? -You can trust me. You can always find out how to reach me through this number. Good luck, Mr. Haddad. Mr. Haddad. James Murphy. HADDAD: Good evening. My wife is out playing bridge. Scotch, sir? Thank you. You know, Hess is a stubborn old devil, but in a strange way I've come to admire him. -How's his health? -Oh, he's very fit for his age. Lately he's been having asthma attacks, but that's all. I mean, he responds to Ephedrine. Has the Colonel explained what I have in mind? Yes, sir. He has. We can't wait for Hess's regular checkup. We have to pick the time and force the convoy to take the shortest route to the hospital which is along the Heerstrasse. That means we have to create an emergency. -Can you handle that? -Yes, sir. If I were to inject him with Propranolol, it would bring on an acute asthma attack. Now, he'd collapse and if they didn't move him quickly enough, he'd die. What would be the procedure? They would get him into the intensive care unit in hospital as quickly as possible. Now if you give me two days notice, I can have him ready within five minutes either way whenever you want him. -Can you mark the ambulance he'll be in? -Yes, sir. A luminous strip of tape on the right rear mudguard. Will that be enough for you? Yes. Thank you. You've been very helpful. One more thing, sir. I was a warrant officer in the Irish Guards. Colonel Reed-Henry has asked me to train your men as a Royal Military Police. I trust you will tell me where and when? You're gonna be a very busy man. Yes, sir. I enjoy that. Being a prison warder is not exactly my line. What do you want me to hit? A Mercedes ambulance. It'll be traveling in an armed military convoy. I want it knocked on its side. So you'll be skidding across these railroad lines. -The timing has to be perfect. -What car do you want me to drive? That's up to you. Can I modify the Mercedes to control better in a spin? No, not at all. And no protection. Nothing except a seatbelt. I don't want them to think this is anything but an ordinary traffic accident. You were speeding, you hit something and you skidded. I will need this road to be wet for the skid. Okay, we'll have to figure that out. The deal is worth 25,000 American dollars. I'll do it. FAULKNER: John, start walking towards your car. When I say fall, hit the ground. Right. Let's go. That's Faulkner. -Where is he? -Never mind. Just keep walking. FAULKNER: Fall. [GUNSHOTS] Just try and look as if it's normal practice for you to fall on your arses all the time. -Thanks, Alex. -[FAULKNER CHUCKLES] FAULKNER: I think I'll give the silly buggers a decent send-off. [EXPLOSION] I assure you I knew nothing about it. We have an agreement and you'd better stick to it. STROEBLING: Which I've done. Word has gone out. I guarantee you this will not happen again. I can only apologize for the inconvenience. Excuse me, miss. Do you speak English? -Yes, I do. -Would you mind having a look at this? Oh, I'm as lost as a babe in the woods. Oh. Oh, if I could only find out where I am. Here, I'll lay it out here for you. Could you point out the Kudamm to me. I don't know where that is. Well, let's see, we're on the... [SCREAMS] -[SCREAMS] -Come on, get in. Get in there. [PHONE RINGS] STROEBLING: Mr. Haddad. How did you get this number? That's not important. I have taken the girl. That is. Mr. Haddad. I'm here. I believe in insurance. Especially when it's free. You and I shall meet later to discuss this. [BELL TOLLING] [DOG BARKING] Good afternoon. What do you want? You have an assassin working for you. Colonel Faulkner. I want him brought out into the open so he can be killed. I won't do that. If that's what this meeting is about, it's over. What if I told you that it's his life against the girl's? Then kill her. -You surprise me. [CHUCKLES] -Do I? Look down very casually at my left hand. I don't mind dying at all. How about my life for yours, right here and now? Neither of us wants that. Put the knife away. Not yet. I'm committed to giving you Hess. When I do, I get the girl. Then and there. Or I will kill Hess. Agreed. And Faulkner? All right, he stays alive. But you bring him in where I can keep an eye on him. [CHUCKLES] An eye on Colonel Faulkner. Now that is amusing. No it isn't, Mr. Haddad. Because I'm putting a man with you until it's over. He will see that you honor your bargain. I have to go. You keep Faulkner and you get a new lieutenant. Excellent. Now, that would have been a foolish waste. HADDAD: I have one question. It's just curiosity. Why do you want Hess? I work for the Soviets now, for my own personal reasons. No ideology is involved. I have no love for them. Nor for the English or the Americans who have defeated and destroyed my country twice. I am still a German. Hess knows of secret summits and betrayals, which will savage Russia and England for as long as man will remember. What happens to me then no longer matters. This is your man. He's I.R.A. He doesn't even remember how many British soldiers he's killed in Northern Ireland. We exchange terrorists because we need new faces. I want to know the girl stays unharmed. You'll be allowed to speak to her by phone. Hourigan will have the various numbers. Mr. Hourigan. Mr. Haddad. I'm very pleased to meet you. Go fuck yourself, Mr. Hourigan. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] Joseph. It's good to see you. Jamil. Pierre. Michael. She's all right. I'll explain everything later. [BOTH EXCLAIM] Patrick Hourigan. This is Joseph, Jamil, Michael, Pierre, Alex. We'll all be living here, working together. We'll take turns cleaning up and cooking. Michael and I will share that bedroom there. Alex gets the small bedroom to himself. Hourigan, Joseph and Jamil share the large bedroom. Pierre sleeps at home. Wait a minute. I don't share a room with any wogs. So you can change your bloody sleeping arrangements. Hey! You! What's the matter with the wops? Wogs. I said wogs. Wogs. Oh, wogs! Please excuse me. I'm so sorry. I think you say the wops. Arabs. Them bastards. Ah. You know, you want to be a little bit careful, because the boss you know, he's a wog. And them, I think they're Jews, I don't know. It's a bit of a problem, because you don't want to spend all the night in the toilet. Unless maybe you don't mind to share a room with a wop? All right, all right. At least you're a white man. A white man, yeah. Very much your lucky day, old man. You've got yourself a room with a British Army Officer, Alex Faulkner. [ALL LAUGHING] I am Sergeant-Major Murphy. Good evening, gentlemen. Have any of you had any formal military training? Right here. The correct answer to the question is "Yes, sir." Yes, sir. What's your name? Hourigan. -H-O-U... -Enough! I didn't ask you that. I asked for your name! Hourigan. Patrick M, sir. And where did you serve? In your shit-eating Brit army, sir! [PHONE RINGING] -HADDAD: Put her on. -Immediately? Mr. Haddad. [SHIP HORN BLOWING] -Hello? -Kathy, are you all right? KATHY: Yes, I'm fine. Have they hurt you? -No. -Are they forcing you to give me these answers? [STAMMERING] No, John. I'm all right. Really. Don't worry. I just miss you. I miss you. Listen, Michael's here. I'm going to put him on. -Hello, Kathy? -Michael. Michael. I didn't know you were here. It's so good to hear your voice. Yours too, sweetheart. You sound fine. Yes I am. Uh, where are you? Don't worry about me. The only thing that's important now is you. Kathy, do you have any idea where you are? Kathy? Kathy? Stroebling? Stroebling? Stroebling? Mr. Hourigan. You need a shine. Work on it. El Ali is a man of all trades, schemes and skullduggeries, and a procurer of the unprocurable. And the server of the undrinkable. [LAUGHS] Good for you, sir. So what can I do for you? Let's start with seven passports. -What nationality? -I don't know. They have to be real people who are visiting here for one day. And those seven people have to be persuaded to stay in Berlin on that day instead of going back to their own country. [CHUCKLES] Persuaded? Most enjoyable. I assume they're to be part of a large group of tourists? Yes. I also want a dead body. A recognizable face. We'll want the same physical characteristics listed here, more or less. Just enough to pass quick scrutiny. You'll also want him kept frozen. I know a reliable mortician. [DOOR CLOSES] [HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE] You're still not about to tell me what the hell's going on, are you? No. Who's hired who, John? While you're here you do what I say. You'd better understand that now. Oh, you've done a damn fine job of it so far, boss man. My sister's waiting somewhere for a bullet. Michael, you're gonna have to trust me whether you like it or not. If you don't, I guarantee you, we're all dead, Kathy included. [MURPHY SHOUTING] Parade halt! He's a delightful fellow, that Hourigan. Oh, he's charming. Do you know what the darling man does? He offers me LSD tablets in a glass of booze at night. From the goodness of his heart, you understand. [BEEP] I, of course, pretend to take them. I chuck them down the loo. I then begin to describe to him the gorgeous colors that I'm supposed to be seeing. When he thinks I'm too spaced out to notice, he sneaks out of the window and he's gone for a couple of hours. Yeah, that must be when he goes to report to Stroebling. -You throw the stuff down the toilet, right? -Mmm. [MURPHY SHOUTING] Mmm. Now this is everything I could find. We've got an international book fair next Wednesday. We've got a jazz festival, figure skating championships, three big soccer matches, a short subjects film festival, a Western European Economic Conference, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. It's all there, dates, places, everything. Is that it? Yes. Good work, Michael. Yeah. EL ALI: August the 26th. Excellent. Now, have you decided on the nationality yet? I hope we can settle that right now. There's a football match in the Post Stadium in West Berlin between a German club and an Austrian club, on the 26th. For which El Ali has two tickets. [CHUCKLES] Coincidence is often the rule rather than the exception. I assume there'll be tourists coming in from Austria for the match. Oh, yes. I have influence with a travel company that books some of those tours. What influence? My second cousin owns it. EI AIi sees exactly what you want. Presto! My cousin has the names of all the tour members. Tell me how the tour works. Yes. From Vienna, they come into Schonefeld Airport in East Berlin through the checkpoint by bus to the Post Stadium. East Berlin? All Austrian planes are obliged to land at Schonefeld. They are strictly supervised in the East. But they'll all come home after the match crazy drunk. There is rollicking confusion. It would be dangerous, but with some luck it could be done. So... All right. Austria. [SPORTS COMMENTATOR ON TELEVISION] Ah. [CONSTRAINED BREATHING] That's a queer old show you're puttin' on there, squire. What do you call it? Malaria. Hourigan, would you do me a favor? There's a bottle of pills over there somewhere. Get me three of them and some water. And don't tell Haddad. Malaria? You look as if you'll be dead by the time I get back. [WHISTLING] Well, well, -still in the land of the living, eh? -[QUIVERING] Here. Thanks. Oh, you're welcome, boyo. [CONTINUES SHIVERING] SPORTS COMMENTATOR: You're listening to the live satellite sports from the United States on the American Forces Network, Berlin. What's happening you see is you've got this cleaver in your hand and your other hand is on a table. And you're raising the cleaver because you're going to cut your own hand off. [GROANS] Oh, no. Oh, yes. You bring the cleaver down hard, and your hand falls clean off. [FAULKNER CONTINUES GROANING] And the room is filled with blood. Oh, no, no. You can see the cleaver, can't you? -No. -Up it comes. It's sharp and it's clean, but when it cuts through you, it's dripping with your own blood! Help me! Help! -And down it comes. Now! -Help me. Help! No! Easy, Alex. Take it easy. -Alex, it's all right. It's John. Hold on. -No! No! There's Valium in my suitcase, go get it. Take it easy, take it easy, you just hang on. You're just having a bad trip, that's all. -[GROANS] No. -I've got him. I've got him. Now this is John. This is John. I'm here and nothing can hurt you. [BELL TOLLING] [DOOR OPENS] [CHOKING] You're an inch away from a broken neck. You'll hear it snap. You'll feel yourself die. You ready? I am. Nothing could make me happier. One more wrong move in this house and you're a dead man! This one is a perfect match. With a bit of work, it could be his twin. -It's very good. -Thank you, sir. One more thing. I'm sorry about your football tickets, but I'll be needing you and some of your friends on the 26th. Let me explain. He'll be delivered August 26th, 21:00 hours. Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial. Where are you taking him? All the details are in here. Yeah? -August 26th. 21:00 hours. Have you got that? -Yeah. -Good. -Have the girl with you, or I'll kill him right there. I've now finished with you, gentlemen. Congratulations. You've shaken down very well. But remember always to behave with authority and precision, and I'm sure you will do. And what on earth has happened to you? Who's asking? I'd love to congratulate the other chap. It has been a privilege and a pleasure to work with you, and I should like to wish you the very best of British luck. One last thing. Now I've heard several of you cursing, and you don't sound like soldiers. If it happens during this operation, you are finished, believe me. Now if you feel like cursing, ask Hourigan to teach you. After all if you can swear like a bog Irishman, nobody will even try to understand you. Good day, gentlemen. Hold your ground, Murphy, and hold your mouth and I'll tell you a wee story. I've seen them, Murphy. I've seen them tying string round their turn-ups so the shit doesn't run down the backs of their legs into their boots. I've seen them shoveling their guts back into their tunics out of the gutter and I'll see you, Murphy. I'll see you at the other end of this. I'll see you. What do you say? You dirty, filthy I.R.A. scum. How does it feel, Hourigan? Lovely, isn't it? That's for the three soldiers you got in Belfast. But this one is for me. You won't be needing me anymore, sir. So, I'll say goodbye now. You'll manage without Hourigan. You take over as RSM. No hard feelings, sir. -Thank you, Murphy. -Sir! Nothing changes. Joseph, Jamil, get rid of the body. I'm RSM. Stroebling will kill the girl. Don't worry, Michael. I'll think of something. You know there is a way we can turn this to our advantage. It's really up to you, Michael. -How's that? -I offer you to Stroebling as a second hostage. And how will that help us? Well, say Stroebling buys it, I'll put you on the street, he'll pick you up, Alex will be watching, following. With any luck, you'll lead us to Kathy. You devious bastard! You've been planning this all along, haven't you? If Murphy hadn't have killed Hourigan, -you would have. -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! That was my job. [EXHALES] And I was expendable all the time. I didn't ask you to come here, Michael, and I would have done anything to keep Kathy out of this. It's up to you. Will you do it? Yeah. Michael, do you want to try it on? Sure. [CLEARS THROAT] Hmm, let's see. That'll fit. It's perfect. You know, I may have missed my true calling, I'm a downtown detailer. -What's it for? -Well, actually boy, it's a bomb. No, it's quite all right. It's a rather stylish sort of bomb, I have to say, but it's a bomb, which you're going to be wearing when Stroebling picks you up. All right. Uh, when you trigger this, it's got a 10 second fuse. Burns like hell for about half a minute and then it'll explode. Now, I want it to go off at exactly 20:30 hours. -Now, this is the trigger. -Mmm-hmm. You set it going by, by pushing that lever down hard. -You want to try? -Yeah. It's not loaded, or anything, right? Inside here is a glass ampoule, you got to hear it break, hmm? Now, you've got about 40 seconds, the whole thing blows. Forty seconds, right. How do I get to the coat? -Do you smoke? -No. Well, now is your chance to try. Jamil, thermo-heater's still working? Yes, the body is still warm. -Lukas? Get in. -Yes. Search him. HADDAD: Alex? Ah, I've been waiting for you. I've found them, no problem at all. I'm in an old bus right across the street from them, -top deck. -Right, we're on our way. FAULKNER: The address is Manhart Clubs, drive around the back, the door's wide open. -Pierre? -Ready, John, I'm in position. El Ali? Ready and waiting. John, Stroebling's just left. There's two men with him and a driver. -Got it? -Right. Come on over. I've saved you a front seat for the fireworks. The two outside are yours. Then follow me. I believe somewhat, yes, sir. What are you doing? -Sit down, sit down. -I need a cigarette. Listen, all I want is a smoke, is that okay? Yeah, it's okay. Put it out. -Get on the floor. -[KATHY SCREAMING] On the floor, quick, quick! [SCREAMING] [EXPLODES] [KATHY SCREAMS] [MAN GRUNTS] KATHY: Michael, no! Michael, don't. [SCREAMING] KATHY: [SCREAMING] Michael, Michael! [GUNSHOTS] [SHOTS FIRED] [KATHY SCREAMING] [SOBBING] Michael! -Come on, Kathy. -No! No. Michael. No! [KATHY SCREAMING] KATHY: No! [WAILING] I'm sorry, he's dead. KATHY: Michael, no. -Come on, let's get out of here. -Michael, no! -I've got her. -Please, please! He's my brother. This is my brother! -Come on, let's go. -No. Come on, Kathy. Come on. Michael! [SOBBING] -Do you know where you're meeting us? -Yeah. Right, let's go. We... We tried. El Ali, El Ali. -Anything yet? -There's some activity at the prison. -Joseph? -Okay, John, we're here ready, waiting for you. I'm two minutes away. The convoy has just left. I hear you, convoy just left. Joseph? Joseph, I'm almost there. Okay, John? El Ali, El Ali. Which ambulance is he in? He's in the first ambulance, repeat, first ambulance. -I hear you. Pierre? -I hear you. -First ambulance! -Ready for the spraying? On Dickenswegstrasse now, 60 kilometers an hour, about 10 meters between each vehicle. They're now coming up to Pichelsdorf. The ambulances are changing position. He is in the second ambulance now. I am ready. Second ambulance. Water, now. Coming to the bridge now. [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] All right. -Who's in charge here? -I am, sir. Well, transfer this man to the other ambulance and get him to the hospital. -Yes, sir. -Now, get a bloody move on. -Yes, sir. -Come on you two, you heard him. There are men hurt in there, move them. [SIREN WAILING] All right, give the signal. -Now, where's Hess? -Where are the hostages? At this address waiting for you to pick them up. Haddad said to me, "No hostages, no Hess." There's no choice for you. Now, where's Hess? -Haddad said to me... -Do you want this address? Yes, of course. Then tell me, where is Hess? Come on! Haddad holds him at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial. It was not safe to bring him here, too much police here. You are to use our Land Rover, you are to wear these uniforms. They will think you are military police, so, you will be safe. Now, give me the address, please. Get rid of him, and meet us at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial. [GROANS] [ENGINE STARTS] [GUNSHOT FIRED] -How is he? -I think, all right. Let's go. If he starts to come through, give him a sedative. Haddad. -How is he? -Awake. Very tired, breathing okay. We got him. Pierre's dead. Well, we've got to fill the same places on the coach. So, he is going to have to come along with us. And we'll just have to hope that Michael's passport works for him. You better tell him. All right, you're going to be with Hess. He's your grandfather and he's very, very drunk. And he doesn't know what he's doing or where he is. Can you do it? What can I say to you about Michael? -Nothing. -Okay, come on. There, towards bus number one. Pull in here. The German's are quiet, Austria won. Right, from now on, we're drunk and happy. Get on the bus, you drunken pig. You two were not on this bus coming here. Oh, we were in bus number two. So, these men asked us to change seats so they could play cards with their friends. This is my grandfather. Too much drinking. This is against the rules. [DOG BARKING] Seamus! [WHISTLES] -Here, come on! -[BARKS] Murphy. Sir. -We've had a problem. -What's happened? [SHOT FIRED] I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Passport, bitte. He's my grandfather. Thank you. MAN: Auf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen! Well, gentlemen, at long last, we are all agreed on something. It's not Hess. [SPEAKING GERMAN] You. Hey, you. Show me your passport. -My passport? You've seen my passport. -Come on. I don't understand the problem. Please, I've shown it several times already. Show me your papers. -Quickly! -Hold on, I think I've got his papers. Here, here it is. This is his passport, see there. [EXCLAIMS] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCING OVER PA] WOMAN: [OVER PA] Attention please, Fortune airlines is now ready for departure of charter flight 8087 to Vienna. Please proceed to gate 12. ...expect me to sit off and ask them questions. -Willy. -Ah! Come in, come in. We congratulate you. Well done, well done! Here, you must have some vodka. -No, thank you, I don't... -Nonsense, you deserve it. And some caviar. I was just now telling Ilya if you could have seen Barclay's face. "Well, gentlemen, we all agree it's not Hess." Come, drink. To the end of Hess. -Willy, you don't drink with us. -Look, it all went wrong. -[LAUGHS] You joke with us. -Be quiet. Explain. I have no excuses for this. Haddad outsmarted me. I killed three men, I was sure that one of them was Hess. It wasn't. Impossible. -What are you saying? -I told you to be quiet. Who was it? Stroebling. Where is Hess? I don't know. Maybe you should drink that now. You have served us well for many years, but there is no reward for you. This incident is too sensitive. I am sure you understand. [GUNSHOT] See that his body is found in the British Sector. FAULKNER: Would you like some of this? It's fresh orange juice. Yes, please. Vienna. -This is Vienna? -HADDAD: Yes, you are safe here. From what? -FAULKNER: John, he should rest. -Yes. Are you hungry? No, I would like to sit. Tell me, why am I here? Who are you people? It's very complicated. -After you're rested... -Ah, please, I'm not a child, I was given drugs, yes? -Yes. -Yes, why? We did it. We're at the company's guest house and he's in the next room. Oh, that's fantastic. How did you do it? Oh, don't. No. Save me the details till later. We got too much to do. Where's Michael? Oh, this is incredible. -Michael is dead. -Michael is dead? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, what happened? He was killed in Berlin yesterday. Oh, no. Jeez! Oh, Kathy, I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. Anyhow, look, I don't want to talk about it now. Like you said, there's too much to be done. I'll need my crew tomorrow morning, because I can't do anything else without them. I thought what I'd do is start with a small interview with him discussing his background, the escape... And hopefully, I'll get him to reveal the secret deals that were offered. Right, uh... Listen, I'll be there with the crew tomorrow. How do you feel? I have sat here and heard you, young lady. And now, I understand. Mr. Hess, I would like very much to... No, please. I would like to talk. Do me the kindness of listening. What I have done in my past is done. Whether I regret or not is not something I discuss with you now. I have had a long time to think. So many years, so many things to think about, and to remember. I admire your effort to free me, but I think it was not all done for me, eh? It was done for you, too. FAULKNER: Well, it was done for all of us. But you don't belong in prison anymore. Ah... There are those who would disagree with you. What's your name? -Who are you? -My name's Alex Faulkner. I am a professional mercenary soldier. Oh, and who am I to question that? But I know what you will all ask of me. You think I have been eager to tell my story. These many years, to tell what things I know. Yes, I have thought of that. Long ago, I asked myself, "Why? "What difference will it make? "What good can it do?" It could change the course of world history. You think that? [SCOFFS] I've really changed history for the better, or the worse? This is just a story from the past told by a relic, which people may or may not believe. And how will you tell the world, if they do? So, best that it dies with me. I cannot help you and I will not. I'm only an old man now, and soon I will die. So, I ask this favor of you. I want to die at home. And the only home I know is my cell in Spandau. What I have left to me there is solitude, and a place that is familiar. I know nothing of your world. I'm afraid of it. And I have long ago accepted mine. Where life is a routine I understand, the quiet death awaits me. And is my only reward. Please, take me home. -[CLOCK CHIMES] -I have nothing more to say. I'm... Very tired now. Come. Let me help you to bed. Oh, yes. Please. HADDAD: It would be difficult for me to count the number of people who died on this rescue operation. I can think of at least 19. There were probably more. Didn't ask to be rescued. It would be impossible for me to count all the people who died all those years ago because I was what I was. Thousands! Millions! I don't know. Only know, I don't deserve to be free. HESS: Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Yes. Ah, thank you. The French, they will send me back to Spandau? -Yes. -Ah. It is, what is that damn word of yours. Enigma? Yeah. An enigma that a free man wishes to return to prison to die. You don't understand it, do you? Well, we all make our own prisons in one kind or another. Yours just happens to have bars. Or, as a very wise man once said, "Toodle pip." -Where are you going? -Well, apart from gaining access to an establishment that sells brown, Scottish liquid, I haven't the faintest idea. Good bye, Alex. Take care of yourself. Sure. Ain't you splendid? Oh, by the way, lovely party. Thanks, most awfully.
