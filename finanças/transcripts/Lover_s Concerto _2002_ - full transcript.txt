I have his pictures My father loved to take photos We probably have as many as ten family albums When we look at them when relatives come over, they think we're strange Since we have fun and laugh at the pictures But we're laughing because we're happy There's a photo of us at the amusement park, and one in front of our house when we first moved in There's even a photo of all the family naked Hey, that sounds like a lie It's true We took baths together until I was nine Oh, yeah How did you come up with that clock idea? There he is! Ji-hwan got a haircut Do you mind moving your foot? What did you say? You prick Move your foot My friend finds it uncomfortable Hey, let's move back Thanks Ji-hwan Hey, you're pretty brave I'm shaking all over I've fallen in love What should I do? It's no big deal No, it hurts so much But I want to keep on hurting It's Ji-hwan! Oh no, it's a cop! Hold hands One, two, three Match the steps Left, left, left... Dad, did you see the movie Il Postino? Il Posit? Is that really a movie? You have to see it with mom It's very moving I've fallen in love What should I do?

Your pictures I put some I liked in my room It's okay, right? Of course Still taking pictures lately? No My camera is probably rusted by now Well, taking pictures can't pay for your tuition You know what? I liked your pictures, but I liked watching you take them better You look a lot better now That rotten little... When are you getting married? I want to as soon as possible But she said she doesn't trust me still '96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee Don't you miss them? I sometimes think about them Chul-hyun What if... If What if they had called to meet? Did they call you? They did, huh? Not really I'm not sure What's that supposed to mean? Should I meet them? What's the problem? Do you still have feelings for them? At first, as time passed I thought of them hundred times a day, then ninety-nine, ninety-eight, ninety-seven, and then when I forgot to count, I was confused on whether they had black or brown hair, or if I had really liked them, or wonder if we really did meet I thought about those things '96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee I'm gonna marry him He likes you, too? No Yes, probably He always recommends love stories and poems And he smiles at me always Ji-hwan, can you do me a favor? He always eats a little That's why he doesn't gain weight It's so irritating Want me to just talk to him, right? Yeah Hi Hello Need a book? That's okay I'll pick one out myself today He's my friend from church Hello Oh, hello You pick one out, too Okay Excuse me What's the most Popular book these days? What kind of books do you like? Well, anything that's easy to read Have you ever read Hu Sam-gwan's Blood? I already read that... So... I heard that this book is really good This one? Yes It's great What is it about? It's like a detective story The author is German His shoulders are wider than I thought I better change the size Isn't he good-looking? It seemed as if he was jealous of you, too But Ji-yoon, we look so much alike, so wouldn't he realize that we were related? Look at our nose and mouth And when a guy knows some girl likes him, he'll stay distant, even if he likes her No, we don't look alike at all Your eyes are more slanted And you have a Bigger head than me It's hand-made I'm not sure Min-sik! Come here for a sec Have you ever seen this letter? Oh, this Do you know it? Absolutely no idea There's no address and no name Who'd sent it like this? My name is Hang Min-shik I deliver mail in a small town I've been delivering these strange mails lately This is her room I'm in love with this girl I don't understand why she doesn't send these letters But anyhow, I'm just a postman She's taking pictures again today Holding back my wish to scribble with you together I told you I'm busy Just one more question Are your dreams often colorful? No No It's often for me Yes Here are the results Kyung-hee and I are the same type Someone who has one heart to love only one person Never cheats, but due to obsessiveness, you're likely to be a stalker Fantastic One heart to love only one person What about me? What does it say? Ji-hwan, you're the most indecisive Not any good as a lover You imagine and decide on your own, so you're left just liking the girl If you do date, you'll break a lot of promises The worst of their kind Do you believe that stuff? That's girls for you No need to get upset Soo-in Go help Ji-hwan It'll be good exercise Think so? Ji-hwan, what's your blood type? Not again A type Hey What are you doing here alone? Oh, nothing Just hanging out They're so lucky Don't they look good together? It's not easy to fall in love at first sight It's so wonderful Gonna stay over, right? No, I got things to do Like what? I told you I gotta go Kyung-hee Why do you always ask favors, and I have to carry them out? Because you never asked me Whatever I'm tired of that face Always pretending to be weak, and as if the world will end if you're not treated well How long do you think I'll be by your side? Tell me Tell me! Kyung-hee, I'm just... Let's stop I'm going, bye Kyung-hee Just like you, I don't know what to do They came at five in the morning They ran away because their parents disapproved I'm going no matter what you say Your turn I'm going no matter what, so don't worry Sorry dad Good enough?

Sure we can see fireflies here? Yeah But I think we came too late Thought they'd still be here Hey, let's call the fireflies How? I saw it in some book If you close your eyes and call them inside, they'll know to come to you I don't believe you Hurry up I'm closing my eyes It's cold! Hey, how come you guys are leaving me out? Isn't she cute? Yeah Sometimes I want to press her down, catch her, and then put herin my pocket Then take her out whenever I feel bad Me, too Ji-hwan Thanks for coming with us If it wasn't for you, we'd never go on this trip You see, we never went on a normal trip before I'm more grateful Wait, where's Kyung-hee? Kyung-hee? Huh? Kyung-hee! Aren't those her shoes? Kyung-hee! Kyung-hee! Kyung-hee! I love you my friends! Hey! What are you doing here? You're awake Is Kyung-hee still sleeping? Yeah Didn't you two sleep in your room? Because of the mosquitoes, we couldn't sleep You must've been really tired We tried to wake you up several times I see Wanna talk about our first love for fun? First love? It's better than just sitting here I like listening to other people's love stories Yeah? Then you go first um... In junior high, this girl worked at a comic book shop, Because of her big eyes, everybody seemed to be attracted to her She was really popular among the guys I went there everyday to go see her All the boys liked her and came to the store But one day something happened Hey, big eyes What's your name? Hey, let me see your face You pricks, mind your own business! Big eyes, you're my girl Everybody got that? I read five of them You're lying You only read one Huh? What's your name? Ji-hwan Lee Ji-hwan Can you fight well? Yes, I can he calls me but I don't afraid at all Because she was behind me I raised my fists, and went after him screaming It was good up till then And then? I got beaten I couldn't hit him even once, and he almost killed me So, she turned her back on me and left I guessed she liked macho men I heard she married him, and they run a tent bar now The end Now, it's your turn When I was a kid, I was in the hospital once That's where I met him He was a notorious troublemaker at that hospital He played a prank on the nurses, and then hid in my room the first time I saw him, he smiled really stupid We became friends quickly, and my room turned completely into a playground He was special He was very sick, but a smile never left his face When I think of it now, it's really funny, but I asked people to call me by his name Why? Well, I thought that even if we were to split apart, I'd feel as if I was always with him Ji-hwan What, Soo-in? We've finally made it the snow on top of the trees is so beautiful people call it snow flowers Wow, you could be a tour guide We'll just have to come this winter Yeah Let's come again during winter I'm serious Promise Promise Seal Doesn't seem like it'll stop raining soon We'd better hurry Yeah, let's hurry A little more Let's stay a little longer Hold on a little more We'll get there soon Sorry for begging you to come You know me Right? I'm okay Is she better? Yeah, she just fell asleep I'm okay I'm okay Never saw someone cry before? No, it's just... Just that it's awkward Hey! I just got sentimental since it's raining Why?

No I don't like him anymore He absolutely has no sense And he's not that good-looking up close And he seems to flirt with anyone Plus, he's going to the army He seems so weak, so how could they take him in?
