Mmm. Yankee. Koch. What you need, man? What's this? Let me go, man! Let me go. English then. Operation Overload. I want to know how many men your army's sending to France. Ah! How many men come by plane and how many men by vessel? Speak or I will begin pulling your teeth out, one by one. I don't know. You will tell me! Enough games! Now tell me how many men come to the beach? I don't know! - Huh? - I don't know! I don't believe you. What're you doing? I don't know what you're talking about! Fuck no! No! Brown. Colonel. French hospitality. I hear you're a good man in tight spots, is that true? Not sure I understand the question, sir. At ease, solider. You can speak freely here. I signed up for the front lines, sir. So you enjoy combat. I do, sir. You enlisted with the hopes of killing Nazis. I did, sir. We're here, Normandy's here. To the east is an abandoned prison camp, do you know it? Yes sir, we passed it on our first march. It's a ghost town, sir. Only to the naked eye. It appears to be a strategic withdraw by the Germans. They're holding one of our men there. A young private named Donovan. You know him? No, sir. Well, in five days I'm gonna send 150 thousand men across that sand. Since Donovan's been missing, the Germans have been setting up fortifications and artillery the likes we've never seen. We have reason to believe Donovan may be giving them sensitive information. How many Germans, sir? We believe six. That should be plenty for a healthy young man such as yourself. So tell me about your home. I'm not sure I understand the relevance of the question, sir. Just trying to understand the man who may save the war for our side is all. From Texas. Father passed away a year before I enlisted. Mother is still there. I imagine she wasn't pleased with your decision to be here and not at home. What are you asking me, sir? I need you to find our man. If he's still alive, we need to find out how much of Operation Overlord he has given to the Germans. If not, Normandy could be a massacre. And if he spoke to the Germans, sir? Leave him to the mercy of the SS. Is there any questions? No, sir. Pick a soldier that you trust. Pack your gear. You're on your way immediately. So? Orders from Colonel Landy. We're to head east. Away from the beach? That's right. Huh. I was hoping today would be a good day. The whole battalion? Just you and me. We leave immediately. Get your kit. What's east? A Private Donovan. An American caught by the Nazis. Landy seems to think he's leaking information in regards to Overlord. And he's only sending two men. As to not attract the German's attention. Besides, if he's giving up our plan, he's not worth the hundreds of American lives. Only ours. So what, he's a spy? He is a prisoner and an American soldier. There's nothing more to discuss. Well, I guess we'll have to wait to leave till dark, huh? No, we leave now. Besides, on the last March, the Germans were already gone. Ha. Yet we only pack grenades. 30 miles. How long will that take, 10 hours? 12 at the most? It'll give us time till the sun sets. Otherwise, we're wide open. A massacre, Anderson. It's gonna be a massacre. Those were Landy's words, not mine. This is our chance to make a difference. And kill Nazis in the progress. We complete the mission and we go home. And you can stop kissing that fucking picture. Have a set of real lips for the first time. You got two minutes, make up your mind. All right. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Hmm. Having a child was my greatest achievement in life. It was my savior before the Führer came to power. A child is a gift that reminds you of what is important. She's a very beautiful little girl. Yeah. It is senseless for her to grow up without a father. Yeah? Give me the journal! No. I'm going to burn it and then I'm going to go get the wrench and I'm going to pull your toes off. Slowly. And then, we're going to place them up your ass one at a time. What is the American expression? Foot up your own ass? When they come for me and I get out of this cage, I'm going to kill you. Hey, so what does that make you? Three wins, six loses. Three wins, six loses. What are you, a parrot? Hey man, it's not that bad. It's not good either. It doesn't matter. She doesn't need to know your record. She loves the fact that you're a boxer. Trust me. - Huh? - Hey. Blonde curls, breasts out to here. Long legs. I mean, man, this dame is to kill for. I don't know. Hey man, just one date, huh? That's all I'm asking. I just don't want to commit to anything is all. What does that mean? It means, this war ain't over yet. All right, we're nearly there. German building's gonna be 150 yards passed that road. You really think you're not gonna make it after this war? What? War ain't over yet. Do any of us go home the way we left? My father was in the... in France in '17. He survived that set trench by being blown to hell. He said that there were bodies blowing everywhere. I mean, all over the place, you could just walk right over them. What happened to him? Your father. Fuck knows. Okay, hold on, hold on. Who knows? Yeah, well, I mean... Maybe he was lost in the sandbags or something, I don't know. That's my point. Yeah. I know that's your point, Brown. All right, shut the fuck up before they get down on us. All right. Come on. Will you hurry up? Lay off me, Brown. Just keep an eye out, all right? Yeah. If you don't hurry, some Nazi's gonna run up and shoot your dick off. I'm trying to concentrate, all right? Just stop talking and go. Exactly. Stop talking so I can go. That's what I said. Fuck it. Hang on. I gotta tinkle a little bit more. Check your prostate. All right. Let's get out of here. You good? Let's go. Shit. Get down, my ass. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh man. It's a trail. What is it? I've been on this road before. Yeah, how do you know that? Whoa. Well I'll be a monkey's ass dingleberry. Damn right. Hang on. Fuck. Ca-caw, man. Ca-caw. So now what? We find another way. Yeah. Find us another way, slinger. Bring me to him. Mickey Mouse, New York City, yeah? Yes. The mission has been box. I told you people. I don't know how many men are coming. By tomorrow, our defenses will be in place along the beach. We will no longer have a need for you. Are you understanding what I say? So you're gonna kill me? Because I didn't give you information that I didn't have? You sauerkraut-eating bitch. Hmm. Tell me. What do you imagine your generals will think should we let you live? They will assume that you gave us the information about Operation Overload. They will hang you as a spy. They don't hang people in my country, except maybe a few Germans. America. We'll need to find out how many men are in here. Well, we'll draw some straws, right? See whoever comes out first. Huh? How're we gonna draw them out? We need a diversion. Yeah well, I could fire a few rounds, break some glass. Let 'em know we're here, right? I was thinking a flare. You don't have any flares? No, I don't have any flares, you? No, fuck no. Fuck. I got an idea. Make it count. Make it count. Oh, shit. Okay, so I count three. All officers. So few? My guess, Germans want this on the down low. All right, so now what do we do? Play by the same rules. Get Donovan, get the hell out of here undetected. - Yeah. - Yeah. That's if he's still alive. Son of a bitch, look at that right there. All right. He's separated from the rest of them. Okay. He's the one we get first. See who comes after him once he goes missing. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. - What? - I just wanna be clear. What're we going? We're under direct orders from Colonel Landy from the 8th. Yeah. We're doing what the fuck we want. They got one of ours. That's right, okay. Hey. What? Shouldn't we put these straps on? No, forget the straps. Okay. You speak English? We take that gag out of your mouth and you scream, I'm gonna shove it in there and we're gonna kill you slow. You understand? No screaming. Hey, English! Not that Val-Jerry shit. Donovan. The kid. You know him? We have info he's being stationed somewhere in this complex. You wanna tell us where he is? The sun's setting. We have all night to sit here. Go fuck yourself. Hey, I would. But I'm exhausted from fucking your sister. Huh? How many men are here? You can't expect me to tell you anything. Oh, that's exactly what I expect you to do. Why? Because your life depends on it. You're going to kill me anyways, you pig-fucking Americans. Coming from a Jew-killing Nazi, I take that as a compliment. You have five minutes to tell us how many men are here and how they're armed. Hit him again. What did you say? Huh? What did you say? Four minutes. Three SS soldiers and one Lieutenant Colonel. Armed? Thank you. 18 years old. Rogers from Kansas City. He was with us when they dropped us into Nadine. He was shot three times before he even hit the ground. His parents were dairy farmers. I landed six feet from him. His parachute was all tangled up and blood had already filled his lungs. With his dying breath, he had one wish. For me to kill that Nazi that shot him dead. Now, I realize you might not be that one but you know what they say. One dead Nazi is as good as the next. Nein, nein, nein! 10. Did you hear what I said? What? Well, he was saying. "Nine, nine, nine, nine!" And I, bam! 10. You need help. Goddamn it. Let's go find the upstairs. I thought it was funny. She has told you that your window of worth is diminishing. Yes? Such a beautiful family you have back in New York City. I have a cousin also in New York. He married an Albanian dancer. They have a child as well. I believe a boy. I look at this photo of your family and I think to myself, I wonder if my cousin would find it difficult to locate them in such a large city. Good thing that I have the address. You wouldn't dare hurt my family. I would. I would! You will tell me how many Americans are coming to the beach if only to save your family's life! And to further my good graces with the Führer! Now, you will tell me how many men come by vessel and how many come by plane! 12 hundred. Got a lot of bombers. 22 hundred Canadian. 160 thousand troops at Normandy. 83 thousand British and Canadian troops at Gold, Juno and Sword beaches. Your family thanks you. The Führer thanks you. And you are now officially a trader! You son of a bitch! You do what you want with me but my family is not to be touched. This place is a fucking maze. What building is this? Uh... Nine. Wait, wait, wait. 14. Fuck, man, I don't know. Hey man, was that guy lying? Was he lying about this whole place being riddled with freaking Nazis? No. But they will find that dead body back there. Oh man. So we need to get to Donovan before they kill him, no matter how many there are. All right. Oh! Cover me! Oh fuck. Nice shot. - Yeah, you're welcome. - Yeah. Oh man. You think they heard all that? We ain't sticking around to find out. Let's find a hole. Dig in for awhile. All right. After you. Let me see this girl you're always looking at. She's beautiful. Oh yeah. When's the last she wrote you? Oh, was it... Week before last. Yeah. I try to write her as much as I can. Every chance I get. She doesn't do the same? Hmm. Her father. He just thinks that a soldier doesn't make a great husband. How about that? Yeah. He thinks a mail worker makes a better life partner. He's probably right. Damn it, Brown. Now why do you have to go and do that? Do what? Be so dull. Give me a break, man. Bring me all the way out here for this. Oh hell. Come on, I didn't mean it like that. Soldier's lack of commonsense often find themself in some kind of heroic feat. Like jumping on a grenade to save a platoon. That doesn't necessarily translate in the real world. Back home, ain't no one sitting in some empty Nazi camp waiting on the next battle. Her old man will come around. He just don't understand you is all. He'll come around, I'm sure of it. You're a good man. Yeah, we'll see. What about you? How come you don't have a girl back home? I did, it didn't stick. Oh yeah? What happened? She didn't approve me going off to the war. Didn't approve of the fighting. Come to think of it, there's wasn't much she did approve of. Told her I was enlisting. She cried for a day and a half. Curled up in the bed like a cat. I told her, I said, some places on this earth you gotta go alone. Well, I guess the next morning she agreed with me. All my belongings out there on the vestibule. Nice and folded. Went back to live with my mother. And that, as they say, was that. Sorry about that. So why did you get back in the ring? What, boxing? Yeah. That same hand that could write those love letters, knock you out in one punch. Yeah. Could kill a whole bunch of Jew-murdering Nazis too, huh? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Hey. The sun's coming up. We gotta get ready. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. What's with the mannequins? This place is creepy. They're Nazis, Anderson. Of course it's creepy. Keep your eyes peeled. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, pal. Take it easy. Where are the others! The others! That's not what he asked you, pal. They have killed your friend. That's funny because I didn't hear any screaming. Did you, Brown? Not a peep. Take his weapon! Fuck. Goddamn it. Oh. Brown. What? - Let me see. - No. - Oh fuck. - Fucking killed me. Oh fuck. - Fucking killed me. - Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. I gotta move you, Anderson. I have to move you! I have to move you, ready? Ready? One, two, three! Don't mess with it. I sewed you up the best I could. That's all the morphine I had. Where is he? He's in the other room. What're you... Stop moving, Anderson! What're you gonna do to him? I'm gonna question him. We're gonna get Donovan, we're all gonna get out of here. Together. Hey. Why me? What's that? When you talked to Landy. Why did you choose me? I trust you, Anderson. Always have. You're not gonna fucking die here. Hey. Let me be the one that puts that bullet in him, will you? Give me that much. You sit right here. Okay? I'll be right in that next room. Don't mess with that wound, yeah? Don't do it. Hey, Brown. What? Don't let me die in this Nazi shit hole. Okay? All right. This is gonna hurt. It's safe to say, I took round number one. One minute, round number two. Where's Donovan? Where's Donovan? Oh fucking hell. Remember him? Anderson. You're gonna tell me where he is. Where's Donovan? Where's Donovan? You're gonna tell me where or I swear, to help me God, I'll beat you till there's nothing left! Up stairs. Up stairs, how many men? How many? Up stairs. Auf wiedersehen. Fuck. Donovan! Donovan! Donovan! Donovan! Over here. Donovan? Yes. Who sent you? Colonel Landy. We don't have much time. All right, where do they keep the key to your cell? Koch, Koch, he's got it, I think. A tall guy. Any others? Two, I think, and a lieutenant. All right, we killed two. Lieutenants are a main concern now. We? Came with a friend from the 8th. He's gone. They just sent two men? Before we go any further, I need to know what you told them. Any information. Donovan! Nothing. Nothing about Overlord? Nothing about the beach or who's coming to France? Look man, I told you, I stayed quiet. Pulled my fucking molars out. All right. Where do we find this Koch fella? Easy, now. How about we put these guns down and figure out a way we all walk out of here? Alive, yeah? Look, look. Look. What are you doing, man? He'll kill us both! Hey, what do you want, soldier? Easy. What're you doing? Quiet, Donovan! He's dead? He's sure as shit ain't alive. Siegmund, the lieutenant, you think he lift? I don't know but we're not sticking around to find out. All right, grab that pistol. What is it? I lied. He threatened to kill my family. How much? All of it. Everything I knew. It didn't occur to you to lie, soldier? Do divert their attention somehow? He threatened to kill my family. How? How? As far as I know, the Germans haven't made a weapon that can reach across the Atlantic, hit your family's house. You really think one German soldier 3,000 miles away could pull that off? Answer the question, solider! What do you want me to say? He told me he already knew. There was a woman, one of Hitler's aids, man. If they already knew our plan, why'd they keep you alive? I don't know. I guess they were planning on executing me and you showed up and ruined their plans. Fucking know. What're you gonna do? Landy was clear. You sing, we leave you here. My business is killing Nazis. Not American soldiers. What Landy doesn't know won't hurt him. But we gotta get back and let him know the Germans are prepared either way. Stay close. We don't know what old Siegmund has in store for us. Move it. We can't go back. What is it? Artillery. They're loading up. Where do we go? Follow me. What're happening? They're heading out. Probably to Normandy. Will they come for us? They haven't yet. Which I assume that means they think we've already left. Leading them on a merry chase. Wish I could've gotten my hands on that lieutenant. Why is that? He has something of mine. Something I can't replace. Something like this? Who is she? That man I came here with, that's his girl back home. I killed the man that took him from her. Doesn't look like I'm gonna get that same satisfaction. Well, at least now you know what it costs to get here. And don't be so sure. France is a big country. What do we do now? They're gone. We get the hell out of here. Stay here. We're good. Drop the weapon! No chance. Drop your weapon or I kill him now! You first, buddy. No. Good morning. Morning. There's something I wanna talk to you about. I saw the brochure in your handbag. I wanna talk to you face-to-face. Well, have you ever been able to keep anything from me? That's why I have to leave. Dad spent three years in France. You heard the story same as me. Stories. Well, if that's what's important to you, you needn't leave home. Train leaves tomorrow. I guess you're off to determine who's right and wrong in the world. Just France. The rest of the world can figure it out on their own. You know, your father had the same misplaced idea before they sent him home in a pine box. Just remember, the dead ones, those are the only ones that see the end of war. Get to work. So you're the little mouse that make all the trouble for me, no? American girl? She's not mine. Then whose is she? The man I came here with. And where is this man of yours now? He's dead. The spoils of war are messy, no? And this? Yours too? Do you know what the Führer expects us to do with American captured soldiers? I could take a guess. Yeah. The information that your fellow soldier has given us will cost you thousands of lives. Some of them your fellow soldiers and some of them allies. Tell me, how does that make you feel? Does it matter? Answer the fucking question! He told the truth to spare the lives of his wife and daughter. No shame in that. I wonder if your generals think this too. Hmm. Or would they call him a spy? A few days from now our forces will slaughter your men at the beach and I will be the one being praised to have bleed the information out of him. You give yourself too much credit. You haven't made it back to Germany yet. Boxer? I too have spent some time in the ring. Where you any good? Not really. What was your record? Three wins, six loses. Well, it is always important that you warm up before a fight. Yeah! It's good, no, huh? Come on, American soldier! Come on! Up, American. Up! There we go, come on. All right, now, let's see what you have, huh? All right, motherfucker! You all right? We gotta go. Wait. You good? I'm good. Gentlemen. Sir. Job well done, Soldier. Where's the man you took with you? He was lost, sir. Have the medics check you out. Both of you. We're fine, sir. Very well then. I guess we should have a drink. And have a very long conversation between the three of us. Hey, Brown. Thanks. I was just doing my job. Not just that. For not telling the colonel what happened back there. Take care of yourself, Donovan. Where are you going? Landy said you can leave. Don't you wanna go home? I'll tell you what. I'll see you on the beach. Oh my god. I'm home, Mamma. Oh my god. Oh. It looks like we have some stories to tell. Yeah, we do. Oh.
