LUCIAN WINTRICH: Hey Siri. Call Lauren Southern. SIRI: Calling Lauren Southern. LUCIAN: Mm-hmm, I'm excited to see you. It's been awhile and we weren't able to touch base in New York. LAUREN SOUTHERN: Oh my God. Finally. LUCIAN: At long last. LAUREN: We've got to [inaudible]. LUCIAN: Okay, love it. I'll talk to you soon girl. Bye. Let's play some music. Oh, my God. Oh you look incredible! You, holy shit. LAUREN: It's you. MAN 2: Nice to see you. It's been so long. LAUREN: Oh my gosh. No kidding. Oh my God, your place looks great. Nice to meet you, Ali. Hi. Pleasure. JOE: Joe. LAUREN: Nice to meet you, Joe. JOE: Nice to meet you. You have to cock it. You have to cock it back. LAUREN: Can you guess who I am? JOE: I have no idea. LAUREN: I'm the IRS. JOE: That's good, that's good. ALI: All right, I'm going to say pre... what is it called, Halloween Takeover? JOE: Yeah, actually, the Halloween Takeover. ALI: Pre hashtag. How do you spell Halloween? Is H-A-... LUCIAN: A-L-O JOE: H-A-L-L-O-W... ALI: No, I just need H-A or H-O? JOE: H-A... ALI: Are you cool doing a Periscope, Lauren? LAUREN: Ladies and gentlemen. LUCIAN: Let's let them pile in first. LAUREN: Oh boy. ALI: Where's your phone? Retweet it. JOE: What about Lauren Southern? Is she a, what do they say? Is she a white nationalist in hiding? LAUREN: I don't want Denmark to become a majority non-Danish. I don't think that's a racist thing of me to want. And I think that we should be able to have that discussion of wanting to preserve people's histories and cultures without that being labeled racist and for all people. MALE REPORTER: Among the huge crowds that greet Donald Trump in city after city are members of the newly coined alt-right, mostly white, male, and for them, Trump has struck a chord. FEMALE REPORTER: Richard Spencer, the man who coined the term alt-right wants an awakening of identity politics, meaning white identity politics. RICHARD SPENCER: America was until this past generation a white country. It is our creation. It is our inheritance and it belongs to us. (applause) FEMALE REPORTER: There's a fine line between free Speech and hate speech, and political activist Lauren Southern has no problem with it. FEMALE REPORTER: She's the young woman at war with the world as she sees it. LAUREN: What happens when you get a Muslim majority in France? What happens when you've got a Muslim majority in London? You have these places that are literally being conquered. I'm just going to want to apply that nice and gently looking good. Awesome. All right. That looks great. MIKE CERNOVICH: It's a fucked up world out there, guys. It's a fucked up world. That's why I have no fucking patience for this white privilege, male privilege, fucking faggotry, you know. MALE REPORTER: Mike Cernovich, the alt-right meme fabricator who invented scandal where none actually existed. MIKE: If we're standing up for Trump by going after the people who are sabotaging him. If we give up, your children will never be safe. There'll be no economy, you'll have no jobs. There might be gulags. Go out and vote. Maga 3X. Make America great again. I'll talk to you soon. MALE REPORTER: What started off as impossible is now reality. GAVIN: We just won the lottery. We just stole America back. JIM: Mainstream media was telling the fake, fucking news. RICHARD: The alt-right just won. To understand the alt-right, I think you do have to understand our lived experience being a young white person in 21st century America, seeing your identity be demeaned. I've lived in this multicultural mess my entire life and I'm trying to get out of it. I want to influence minds. I want to influence the direction of history. I hope you're feeling all right. I've just had a headache for a week. I don't think it's about from having too much to drink last night. It's just the winning. It's too much winning. First off, stand up if you are under the age of 30. Alright, round of applause. This is what a successful movement looks like, period. We should have an ethnostate. It would be a empire that would be welcome to Italians, to Scots, to Russians, to white Americans, to Fins, et cetera. That's what the alt right is doing, it's thinking those political ideas that aren't possible yet and imagining a reality in which they are. To be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror. We build, we produce, we go upward and we recognize the central lie of American race relations. We don't exploit other groups. We don't gain anything from their presence. They need us and not the other way around. We knew he could win. Many of us thought all along that he could win. The mainstream media or perhaps we should refer to them in the original German... The mainstream media never did. We willed Donald Trump into office. We made this dream our reality because for us, as Europeans, it is only normal again when we are great again. Hail Trump. Hail our people. Hail victory. MAN: Yeah! Yeah. Seig Heil! MALE REPORTER: Some startling images quite frankly from the United States. MALE REPORTER 2: The alt-right gathered in Washington to celebrate Donald Trump's victory. FEMALE REPORTER: And we know from what's just happened in presidential politics that they are feeling super empowered. RICHARD: You've dealt with a bunch of guilt ridden, silly whites all your life and we are waking up, we are recognizing who we are and we see amazing future, so you better get ready. MIKE: And we're back. Mike Cernovich, danger and play .com, gorilla mindset. Why did Richard Spencer say hail Trump? Okay, here's the thing. If you think that that is an effective joke and that is going to move the alt-right forward and that is going to move Trump forward and that's going to make America great again, then you are a social retard. I sure wouldn't say, "Hail Trump. Hail Trump. Hail victory." I wouldn't say lugenpresse. Does Richard speak Germany? To all you people saying lugenpresse... Do you speak German mother fuckers? MIKE: I never got mad that you threw Nazi salutes. I got mad that you didn't enforce discipline on your people to throw a Nazi salute. That you didn't realize you can't fucking do this, right. MAN: Are you referring to Richard? MIKE: Yeah, that's when I knew he was a failure, as a man and as a leader. MAN: Are you Mike Cernovich? MIKE: It is. How you doing? MAN: How are you? MIKE: Good to meet you. What's your name? JOE: Joe. MIKE: How you doing, man? MAN: Good to see you. MIKE: Good to meet you. MAN: I'm a big fan of you. I see you on Alex Jones TV a lot. MIKE: Oh perfect. Yeah. ALICIA: Hi, I'm Alicia Powe. I'm here with Mike Cernovich, You've kind of gained a lot of prominence over the last year as the “king of new media.” MIKE: Well the media has done a great favor to me, because if they would have done their jobs, I wouldn't exist. I'm like, I want to be a household name, right. That's what I'm thinking. And I learned from watching pro-wrestling that people like the bad guys more than the good guys. MALE REPORTER: Cernovich entered the online scene as a so-called men's rights activist, including instructions for predatory conquest of women. MIKE: Okay, this is how you fuck a girl like... MALE REPORTER: Right. Practical bullshit. MIKE: Yeah. This is how you fucking choke a bitch. You see a fucking girl, how do you tell if she's submissive? PELLEY: Cernovich streams commentary daily and publishes on social media. He reached Twitter users 83 million times last month. MIKE: We break news live on Periscope. We brainstorm. Today's hashtag is Clinton collapse and we're trending. JIM: Mike was the first one to say, you know, Hillary doesn't look so well. MIKE: Hillary Clinton, on 9/11, a day when you're supposed to show strength, fainted. Right now, all of the evidence points to Parkinson's Disease, that she has Parkinson's. JIM: During the 2016 election, and I've told Mike this, Mike would put out a tweet and it would change the narrative the whole conversation in the country. It all went back to Mike Cernovich. HANNITY: Watch her reaction because it's... look, it almost seems seizure-esque to me. Is that... TRUMP: She's supposed to fight all of these different things and she can't make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break. Give me a break. ♪ CROWD: If we don't get no justice then they don't get no peace. ♪ ♪ If we don't get no justice then they don't get no peace. ♪ ♪ If we don't get no justice then they don't get no peace. ♪♪ STUDENT: Mike Cernovich is one of the most followed and influential commentators among President Trump's core group of supporters. As an umbrella organization for the Republican conservative thought on campus, CCR has invited Mr. Cernovich in order to better understand the Trump presidency, the rise of new media, and the Trump electorate. STUDENT 2: Mike, here you go. MIKE: Thank you. Hello, everybody. WOMAN: Fuck you! MIKE: Welcome to everybody especially the people who haven't realized that you can let me talk to 50 people that I like or you can throw a fit and riot... WOMAN: You're a fucking Nazi, you piece of shit. Get fucked! MIKE: And then I can talk to millions. You're my intern. WOMAN: Fuck you. MIKE: You are my marketing intern. Thanks to you, I will get millions of people watching my message, so thank you very much. CROWD: You little bitch. MIKE: You know, why is it that Mike Cernovich is reaching 100 million people a month on Facebook? Why am I doing 100 million, 200 million impressions a month on Twitter? That is again, because I like to tell people the stories none of you guys are telling. For example, whenever people talk about diversity, and you can show this with pictures, you can say, look at how diverse our newsroom is and if there's no white males in the newsroom that's considered diversity. Now would it be fair to say, do I use hyperbole? Do I use satire? Do I use literary devices? Yes. I would encourage people to read some classical literature and familiarize themselves with the great tradition of Western literature and then maybe you'll understand these iterative devices better. STUDENT: I want to go back to your statement about diversity is white genocide because I don't feel like you properly addressed it. And I just want to ask if you could clarify your stance on that? MIKE: There was a hashtag on Twitter called kill all white men, kill all white men. WOMAN: That's right! MIKE: And, that's right. See. So they go, "Oh, you tweeted out diversity is code word for white genocide." And I go, "Well, there's hashtag kill all white men." And people are like, "Yeah, I totally support that." But I'm the conspiracy theorist, right? Right in this room we have people who want to commit genocide against white people. Kids want to banter, you know. I'll banter right back with them. I definitely would hurt some feelings. I got a few lines. I have a few talking points. Driver: What's your agenda, are you, like, active in politics? MIKE: Good question. I don't know what my agenda is. Mischief making. LAUREN: So this is a boat called the Aquarius that has been illegally bringing in migrants from the Libyan ocean for the last while and they're just heading out again to bring in more illegal migrants and we are going to stop them. No way they're coming in here. No way they're bringing in more illegals. We are done. So guys, if the politicians won't stop the boats, then we'll stop the boats. MAN: Move out. LAUREN: No more, no more, Illegal immigration. No more, no more, illegal immigration. No more, no more, illegal immigration. I love being in Toronto, I love this city. Despite, um, despite, kind of, the leftist mess that it's become, I appreciate, I appreciate that much like New York, it's a place where people come to create things. And a lot of the most interesting people in the world, or at least in Canada, congregate here. So I have to deal with a lot. I leave my house every day with just immense cringe. I mean I certainly have the large amount of public opinion against me and against my skin color, against my sexual persuasion as well, I suppose. I mean, there aren't a lot of good things that the politicians or the media have to say about straight white people. I literally could not see a single European face and not only that, they were giving out free Qurans and free henna in the tents on Canada Day and it was just women in burkas with Canada flag burkas. They either assimilate or they go home. If they don't want to be a part of Western culture, why the hell did they come here? Hi? MAN: Lauren Southern? LAUREN: Yeah. Hi? MAN: I don't follow you too closely, but I know generally what you're up to. LAUREN: Thank you. MAN: Yeah. I appreciate all your work. LAUREN: Pleasure. MAN: To the point where I think you were on the Italian beach and you were like shoving away boats. LAUREN: In Sicily, yes. I wasn't shoving away boats. I was protesting and investigating, but thank you so much for watching. MAN: Yeah. Well, I really appreciate it. And you're one of the freedom warriors. LAUREN: Oh, thank you so much. I'm so young. I'm 22. I'm fighting mostly for my generation. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Testing, testing. JULIA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Testing, testing. LAUREN: What are the biggest red flags you would tell young women to look for when they are dating and trying to find a husband? JULIA: Can you build the deck? Can you fix your toilet? Do you know how to grow crops? I mean like, I don't want to be too extreme, but men with basic life skills are really hot. LAUREN: Women love strength and resources. Men value youth and fertility. These are age old archetypes of warriors and mothers. Feminism in one word, I would have to say toxic. It teaches women to be victims instead of empowering them and encouraging them to achieve and strive for success. CROWD: No means no. No means no. LAUREN: My sign means that this is not a rape culture because rapists go to prison here. Rapists are fired from their jobs. Men who make rape jokes are fired from their jobs. Go to Africa and you will see a real rape culture. JULIA: Have babies. It's like having a best friend that never stops calling. It's really nice. LAUREN: Thank you guys so much for watching and thank you so much for joining me. Brave the World. Go and check out her channel. It'll be in the link below. I'll see you guys next time. Okay, I'm seeing a guy right now. Just been gone on some dates. He's really into politics as well. He's really into kind of nationalism. He's always thinking in terms of what's best for the movement. GEORGE: Dalai Lama says there are too many refugees in Europe. LAUREN: What a lad. GEORGE: See, Dalai Lama is a nationalist. I remember seeing a study that showed that people were happiest in North America during World War II... LAUREN: Fascinating. GEORGE: And lost happiness as things became easier. LAUREN: Much like the reason I want to have children. I've read all the studies, I've seen that people who have kids, they are more unstable to an extent in their happiness levels. They have higher highs and lower lows. But what's the point of stagnating? What's the point of always being on this simple line of I'm just monotone. I'm okay with where I'm at. Why not just be a sea urchin? Why not be a plant at the bottom of the ocean just living. GEORGE: Kind of all of us Europeans, we have the responsibility to reproduce. LAUREN: That's a very cold way of putting it. Is it more than a responsibility? Like do you want to have a family for the sake of love or just because you think it's a duty then? GEORGE: Well, I think, you know, having a family could be really difficult. I think if you go into it thinking I'm doing this for the fun and the pleasure, I think that's the wrong motivation. I think the right mentality is just going to things thinking I'm doing it out of duty. If it's pleasurable and it's fun then awesome, but if it's not, you still do it anyway. It shouldn't be about personal pleasure or personal wellbeing like that's not nationalist, that's not collectivists. LAUREN: But why would people do that? Why would people do something that is uncomfortable? GEORGE: Because it's beautiful. (opera music plays) RICHARD: Is this yours? MAN: That's mine. RICHARD: Okay. The 2016 Alt Right was a lot of anonymous people and a lot of Trump cheerleading. We went from 0-60 in a very short amount of time. Ultimately, there does have to be a political expression of what we are about. MALE REPORTER: We're here today Charlottesville, Virginia where the city is bracing for white nationalists rally on Saturday protesting the planned removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The unite the right event is expected to draw several thousands of people including counter protestors. White nationalist, Richard Spencer organized several similar protests earlier this year. CROWD: Jews will not replace us. Jews will not replace us. Jews will not replace us. Jews will not replace us. MAN: Look at this shit, look at this shit, it's beautiful. Richard. Holy shit, man. How's it going dude? Good to see you. Richard Spencer's here. You will not replace us. (overlapping chatter) RICHARD: Thanks for coming, guys. MAN: Hail victory. RICHARD: Hail victory. Yeah, no away. Hail victory guys. Hail victory. This is a total outrage. We had a permit. They've declared us a unlawful assembly and as you can see. There are militarized police who are moving in. OFFICER: We declared it unlawful assembly. RICHARD: How? We are the ones who support you guys. OFFICER: You will leave the area or be arrested. RICHARD: We'll see you in federal court. You're going to have to drag me out of here. FAITH: Alright, there you go. The full on demonstration. Oh, shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. FEMALE REPORTER: We begin tonight with that breaking news, a horrific scene in Charlottesville, Virginia, a white nationalist rally that descended into deadly violence and chaos. FEMALE REPORTER 2: 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed, in that horrific car attack Saturday. MALE REPORTER: 20-year-old, James Fields, handcuffed at the scene. Police saying he had been marching with white supremacists a short time earlier. TRUMP: We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, on many sides. RICHARD: This is a very important press conference. This was not my rally. I would not have designed the rally like this if I were in charge of it. This is... WOMAN: Why is your name on the flyer then? RICHARD: Because I'm the guest, I'm not the director. MAN: So I take it to fell like you have no, as you put it, "blood on your hands?" RICHARD: No, absolutely not. (overlapping chatter) LAUREN: It really puts you on the map if you're willing to espouse views that the world finds quite shocking. It gets a lot of clicks to be contrarian. WOMAN: Huge fan. LAUREN: Oh, thank you so much. I mean people have to understand, there's a lot of show business in politics. MAN: Go back to Canada, Lauren Southern! LAUREN: Go back to Canada? Why can't they say that to illegals? MIKE: Hey, Lauren. LAUREN: Good see you. MIKE: Good see you. LAUREN: Glad you're okay. MIKE: Yeah, yeah. Good to see you again. I'm happy with my little level of fame, where people are like, ‘hey like your stuff.' LAUREN: I gotta say, yeah, exact same here. I don't want any more of it. I don't want it. MIKE: Right, I'm glad to get rid of the Nazis. They were holding us back. No, I'm glad forcing discipline. No, no. We had to get rid of them. They're a liability. I measure things in how many bodies can you bring. How many asses can you fill. Because I cam from this, I'm not a political guy, I'm an author and everything and I live off what I sell. When I was like 19 living in the Midwest, Esquire had a list of 100 things a man should do before he died and one of them was rent a convertible and drive it up Pacific Coast Highway and now I do that every day. SHAUNA: I got like upset because I know that the stuff about him isn't true. Like he's not a monster. He's not the, you know... Come on, yeah! She is the best thing that has happened to me. Hands down. Hands down. This thing right here. But I mean, and the thing is too with like school, I don't want her to like get bullied or anything like that. Oh, your daddy is this person. Thank you. Like, there was no spell, there isn't like, "Oh, he's making you do this." Like they see our dynamic and I know that's not how it works. So it's all bullshit, dude. Like, I mean, yeah, it's all bullshit. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. MIKE: Shauna is my second wife. My first marriage didn't work out. My ex, she would try to control me a lot. She's a very controlling person, and I'm not somebody who likes to be controlled at all. People now claim that I get alimony from my ex-wife. MAN: If you're dependent on your ex-wife, that doesn't mesh with everything you preach. MIKE: That's what they say, ‘But you claim to be some kind of alpha male.' I'm like, "Well, it's pretty alpha to be paid alimony by a woman," isn't it? How many, well oh but, and then they stumble. This is a nitrous oxide booster. It just improves blood flow to all parts of your body. So before I work out, I like to take, oh, I don't know, 10, 12. I usually have two shots of espresso. Two, let's go. I don't know if we were sitting around too much, but my legs went numb. DANIEL: Oh yeah? MIKE: Never happens. Yeah. That's so weird. (man speaking in native language on phone) SHAUNA: Yeah. MIKE: Hi. (man speaking in native language on phone) SHAUNA: I want a happy family and I want her to grow up with her grandparents around. I want her to learn Farsi. I want her to have a sibling or two more. I want Michael to be happy with... DANIEL: Is he? SHAUNA: He's never happy. MIKE: I'm not a happy person. SHAUNA: Like, if you want to go and dig through his tweets and like dig through his social media, well, why do you leave out the part where, Oh look, this is who he spends the majority of his time with. It's his Iranian wife and her secular Muslim family and a lot of his friends too are, you know, not white. Right babe? And then they have this cutest, little, half-Persian baby... Who wants milk. RICHARD: There was this moment when we were working together where we all supported Trump and there was collaboration, re-tweeting one another, all that kind of stuff. Cernovich was there too and it probably never could last. I have to be brutally honest here. I'm afraid to say that I think Mike Cernovich is a bit of a grifter. This is a guy who is a fake news merchant who was like a previous, like really gross sex blogger and tweeter. I mean, I don't know if anyone's read his previous work. It's awful. MALE REPORTER: And I see that you are all dressed in white. GREG: That was a dress code for tomorrow. We've got white shirts and khakis. White shirts are clean. They're also hard to clean. So it shows that you've put some thought into it, if you can make sure you get all the sweat out of your collar and if you get dirt or blood on it, you have to clean that out every time. So it's a good, uh, it's a good marker for people. MAN: Are you usually followed by so may media outlets? RICHARD: I've gotten used to it over the past year to be honest. The alt-right is talking about ideas that are really powerful and that everyone is thinking about without articulating. CHRIS: You march through Charlottesville, you chant, "Jews will not replace us." You chant "Blood and soil." These are Nazi slogans. You're throwing up Nazi salutes. We all see this everywhere. It's you being a Nazi, like that's scary. RICHARD: I'm not a Nazi. CHRIS: How are you not a Nazi? RICHARD: How am I a Nazi? CHRIS: I mean, at what point when you are doing all these things, are you not a Nazi? RICHARD: At no point in my life have I ever been a Nazi. This is just a slur word. I mean, are you a commie? This is a young person's movement, so we need to go speak to young people because young people have, they've lived this in a way that their parents haven't. MAN: How are you, sir. How do you feel? RICHARD: I feel excited, ready to go. ROBERTS: Security is stepping up as the campus prepares for white nationalist leader, Richard Spencer to speak today. The governor has already declared a state of emergency. ♪ ♪ ENOCH: I'm going to introduce the man himself, our good friend and the spokesperson for white people everywhere, Mr. Richard Spencer. Thank you. RICHARD: We created the United States, I'm referring to white people, white men in particular, and you all know that. You all, I'm, you all think this country is racist, right? (overlapping jeers) WOMAN: Mr. Spencer, you have a right to free speech, but you don't have the right to incite violence. I get it. You don't directly say, "Kill black people, kill Jews" whatever. But your followers seem to take the ideas of a white only ethnostate to heart and they are the ones going out and committing violent acts in your name and in the name of your movement. RICHARD: Name a single... WOMAN: My question is: How do you respond to the people who feel that you should take responsibility for the actions of others that your words RICHARD: What are you referring to? Name a single instance in which some alt right-ist went out and murdered someone? WOMAN: Charlottesville. You organized that rally, people came with riot gear, and someone died. And that was under the name of your movement. How do you not take responsibility for the actions of those people? RICHARD: Absolutely not. What exactly happened with the death of Heather Heyer remains unclear. CROWD: Go home, Spencer! Go home, Spencer! RICHARD: You know that what I am saying is true. You know that what I am saying is powerful. You know that what I'm saying is going to change the world and therefore you all want to stop it. You're going to fail. We are stronger than you and you all know it. That's why you're ganging up here like some kind of mob in order to prevent me from saying something. Do you not want to hear something? CROWD: Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. Go home Spencer. (chanting fades) MAN: That one. (inaudible chatter) CARLSON: British police halted a visit by Canadian journalist Lauren Southern on the grounds that she was quote, a "Radical Christian," and therefore, potentially a terrorist. LAUREN: The UK government in its infinite wisdom has decided, that my presence is not conducive to the public good. This is because I handed out flyers a few months ago in Luton claiming that Allah is gay. So the modern revolutionary rages against progressivism. For this doctrine has become the establishment's bible. We shall speak in Paris, we shall speak in Brussels, We shall never be silent, and ladies and gentlemen, we shall never surrender. I'm like nervous even though I wasn't there giving the speech, that's so weird. ANNOUNCER: How mad is it that she's not allowed into our country? LAUREN: Ok, ready, am I going or are you going? BRITTANY: Just say we are in Russia and why. LAUREN: So, yeah, we are in Russia! There has been a lot of talk about Russia over, obviously, the last couple years. Are they pulling the strings in the US election? Russia is a giant mystery to most of the Western world, and even though I know we are going to get accusations of collusion, and of this we figured someone should go and investigate it! People would say that the far right are inspired by the Russians and controlled by the Russians. If there are all these conspiracies about you, if there are so many people afraid if your ideas you must have something interesting to say. I feel like men are much better at figuring out technology. BRITTANY: Or they like to figure it out. LAUREN: Exactly. They enjoy it. BRITTANY: They have such fun. I'm just like, "Record." LAUREN: How's it going? WOMAN: Everything good. What about you? LAUREN: I'm very good. BRITTANY: Good. LAUREN: Can you describe the average young conservative in Russia and what kind of opinions they have? DARIA: If you ask me, the young woman, I'm strongly fight against the feminism and strongly fight in favor of femininity and I think there's only one proper way how society can be well organized. LAUREN: What would you say to people who believe you hacked the election? LAUREN: I'm very used to being constantly on the fringes, the crazy person who wants to preserve traditional values. Here I'm just normal. Does mine look right? BRITTANY: Yeah, yours looks better than mine. LAUREN: I grew up in a school in Vancouver where it wasn't that bad, but most of the kids... I was already in a school where I was a minority. Being in kind of a very liberal environment, whenever they would bring up super liberal talking points I would just think of something I'd heard on one of my dad's conservative podcasts and I'd say well, I don't know if I fully agree with this but let's drop this bomb and see what the teacher says. Definitely wasn't the best student, but I definitely think I did a good job at causing a little chaos in classrooms every once in a while, and that continued on to a lot of my life. MAN: So, your getting out of politics? BRITTANY: Well, I'll just say I had always made the decision that when I get married, I want to dedicate myself fully to being a mother. And of course, before all of this, I was a writer for like 10 years, science fiction. So I'll return to writing and hopefully contribute politically that way. LAUREN: Women, maybe not all, but many have three to four years in the political realm before they become so hardened and so unemotional because you have to create this outer shell that you no longer really have the ability to get married and be a mother. And just because of the personality you've created to survive in a corporate world... BRITTANY: Yeah, like self-preservation. LAUREN: Or certainly in media world, the self-preservation thing. It's really not the traits of a mother, and I'm terrified of it myself because my goal in life is also to be a mother one day. And so I've got this kind of conflict of I want to have kids and I want to be a mother and I worry that staying in politics will hurt my ability to do that. But I also almost don't want to have kids in a world that is headed in the direction it's headed now. LUCIAN: One, two, three, four, five. FEMALE REPORTER: Lucian, tell me about yourself? First of all, you're gay, you're conservative. You are the creator of Twinks for Trump during the campaign. Tell me about that? LUCAN: So you have relatively well-known, by the way, New York models half naked, two things Liberals love, all homosexual, another thing they love. But like, my God, they were all wearing, make America great again hats. FEMALE REPORTER: Are you drinking bourbon on my show? LUCIAN: This weekend Mike is throwing this incredible party, "A Night for Freedom." This is Mike showing everybody that he can execute something in Manhattan, in one of the most, liberal fucking areas. There are so many closeted conservatives in New York. It's going to be an incredible time. MIKE: And we're back. I'm at the venue and I laid out a deposit and I got set up... MAN: No, no. You can't shoot here. MIKE: You can call... I can do whatever I want, bro. We have a contract. MAN: Actually, there's other clients that we have. MIKE: Good. Call security. So they think they're going to, like, steamroll me. And, you know, it's just not gonna work out that way. So we're going to find a new venue. We have no choice, really. And who do these people think they're fucking with? Maybe you're just conservatives, they just kinda take it and roll over or whatever. But I'm going to fucking ruin this guy. MAN: So Jack has another venue possibly. Well, here's the one catch, if you guys throw in cash just like 15, 20 grand cash today. MIKE: Another reason I hate Richard and all those guys, they're why have to deal with this bullshit. They're why I have to deal with it. A dead girl it ratchets things up. Nazi salute, that ratchets things up. I hope you can help me. I need you to make a cash withdrawal for $20,000. WOMAN: Yeah, sure MIKE: You have that much? Oh, this is incredible! SHAUNA: So what time are we supposed to get ready? MIKE: Like now. SHAUNA: I'm so over the drama. I'm so over the pettiness. I don't even know how we got involved in this. MIKE: I don't either man, it's just inertia. SHAUNA: No. He never cared about politics, he just got in it because, I don't know why, because he was one of the first people to predict that Trump was going to win. And everybody thought... And everyone called him an idiot like, "You're dumb, Mike. You don't know." and so then it just came to the point of like, "Fuck you guys. I'll prove you wrong, we're going to get this motherfucker elected." I was talking to one of our friends, she's like this super like wonder woman lawyer, Muslim. And she was saying, she's like, so these people are saying to me that although Michael had nothing to do with Charlottesville, he helped basically give a platform to the people who, you know, engaged in whatever happened in Charlottesville, you know. By the same time, I don't know if I'm so far down the rabbit hole now that like what he's saying to me is fine. So I don't know. (overlapping chatter) (overlapping chatter) MAN: Is it just us? MAN 2: Just us I think. Okay. OWEN: Way to go, putting this together, dude. MIKE: Fuck it dude. Yeah, fuck these people. OWEN: It's biblical. I love it. WOMAN: Gentlemen, could I have a smile? Enlight your freedom. I don't know, the lighting is ambiguous. GAVIN: These people, the far left, the alt-left have been using violence for a long time and we're now using it back on them. And I would add to this plan of justifying bombs with another thing that's very important to the Western world and that is to breed. Put a ring on it. You've been sowing your wild oats for 10 years, how much coke do you have to do? Stop pulling out like a coward. Make babies, not white babies, Western babies. We need more Western families... OWEN: Who act white. GAVIN: We need more dads. (laughter) DJ: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mike Cernovich. MIKE: So, I'm not going to give a speech, I hate that shit. I'm here to drink and party. So, let's party! ♪ And they stay there ♪ ♪ And they stay there ♪ ♪ And they stay there ♪ ♪ And they stay there ♪ ♪ And they stay there ♪ ♪ And they stay there And they stay there ♪♪ ♪ ♪ GAVIN: Like my boys behind me, I am a Western chauvinist and I refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.

We'll take the panel first and then we'll get your interview with Gavin. LAUREN: Awesome. All right. PRODUCER: After that. MAN: I woke up in Christmas. No, I'm serious, bud. I don't even know how last night ended. I vaguely remember... MAN: You said some shit. GAVIN: It ended here. It ended here. There's some chick who wanted to fuck me last night. MAN: It was my estimation. MAN 2: She should be on the local news. PRODUCER: If there's any last drinks of water here we're going to... GAVIN: We're not in the fucking desert. I hate water. Speaking of breaking the glass ceiling, we had three terrorists, female terrorists who were caught with, I guess, knives was all they had left. I thought they ruined "Ghostbusters", they ruined "Oceans 11", and now we're ruining terrorism. Women ruin everything. PANELIST: Well, now, hold on. You haven't seen "Ghostbusters". You haven't seen... GAVIN: I have seen the female "Ghostbusters". PANELIST: You haven't seen "Oceans Eight". PRODUCER: Three, two, one. GAVIN: I'm just alarmed by the self-hatred that white people have and Westerners have for themselves. I was at my local bar by my house and the guy was selling wine and he said, "These are some great wines from South Africa," and the bartender goes, "I don't want anything from South Africa." LAUREN: The word racist just means nothing to me anymore. It's been so overused that I just have no respect for that term. Because white people aren't supposed to suffer. They're not supposed to have problems. They're supposed to be privileged 100% of the time. GAVIN: Right, they deserve everything they get. MAN: Thank you. LAUREN: Thank you. (phone ringing) LAUREN: Hey, what did I forget? I'm good. We shouldn't be talking about this at all. I was pretty drunk too, I can't, I honestly... I just remember going to sleep. See, the thing is like because my moral compass tells me you have a wife and kids. It's not even in my realm of consideration.

All right, thanks Gav. Bye. Send help. Help. He's like, yeah, it's still trying. ♪ ♪ I've had some scary experiences, some heroes that have fallen for me. I've certainly gotten a shorter fuse for this nonsense of everything is women's fault. Sexual assault is a very real thing. There certainly are power dynamics within the business world where women have to be careful, this is something that I've really learned is the only one that can really protect me is me. And I think women are having to learn a lot of hard lessons. When it comes down to it, you are sometimes your first and last defense. MAN: You did, though, start your career with a lot of anti-feminist commentary. Do you ever have moments where you look back at that early work and say maybe you played a role in that mentality. LAUREN: Hmm... I don't disagree with anything that I've done. I think I've been honest, but the lack of nuance and qualifiers and extra explanations can really hurt a debate when people interpret what you're saying differently than how you wanted it to be interpreted. I've been thinking for a while about stepping away from the political YouTuber life. I kind of entered this world a little bright eyed and bushy tailed, expecting everyone to do dealings honestly, and to tell the truth and to be up front with what they wanted. And that's really not always the case. Being in this crazy, crazy world where fame and money, and politics all exist and meet, I realized a lot of things that I probably should have been more horrified by and more critical of, had just become normal to me. RICHARD: I wanted to be a theater director, and I wanted to do all this Avant Garde stuff, that's how I thought of myself. I am an artist before I'm a politician. I think, you know, a lot of people in the alt-right hate me. You're a trust fund kid or whatever. I think the only actual critique of me is that I'm not elite enough. I don't want this to sound too grandiose, but I mean, I'm bigger than the movement. I don't want to be a beautiful loser. I'm not interested in that. I am interested in changing the world and fundamentally winning. I've been maced, I've been punched, I've been attacked, but I don't think anyone thinks that I'm going to stop. (inaudible chanting) ♪ You're own, personal Jesus ♪ ♪ Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there ♪ KIM: Did you want to talk to... RICHARD: What happened? Oh, no. MAN: We're literally in a fucking riot. RICHARD: There's a fucking going on? Okay. Don't, don't, don't... (overlapping yelling) Do we have another fucking Charlottesville on our, on our hands? Oh, my God. Fuck. MAN: Okay. Let's do this. You ready? RICHARD: Yes. Hello everyone. Thank you for being here. You could gather on the center. That'd be great. I won't need to use a microphone. There is a war going on. There is a silent war going on. It's a war that occurs on the level of demographics, of displacement, of replacement immigration, creating a whole new voting bloc, creating a whole new nation. There is no simple solution to the facts that whites are becoming a minority in the United States quickly. Uh-oh. Look at this guys. Look at this guys. CROWD: Come on, get the fuck out. We don't want you here. RICHARD: This is serious. Where should we walk, Wyatt? Where should we walk? Walk this way, let's go to the public area. MAN: Get the fuck out. RICHARD: I'm being harassed and stalked. MAN: You Nazi fuck, get the fuck out of here. LAUREN: Awesome. Thank you. (speaking in French) Cool, perfect. One of the best ways to get a message across is for it to be beautiful. So I am going to make films that aren't just my opinion. They're actually on the ground showing people what's happening. CAOLAN: If someone donates like on your website or someone makes a big donation, how long until it actually is accessible by you in your even your bank account? It's instant? LAUREN: Instant. I'm trying to think of a way like to say we've ran out of money without being like, "We're fucking poor, help." Like we've exhausted our budget. CAOLAN: I'd just say we thought this would take four weeks and it's been about seven weeks now. So we're completely over budget completely over time. We just want to keep doing this, so if you want to help out. Just so it's like super simple. We want to maximize the reach of what we are doing and we want to make sure it looks good as well. And if you convey your message, which is seen as fringe, in that mainstream, polished environment, then it will sterilize it a bit and make it more palpable. A lot of people leave the left, a lot of people leave non-politics and they go right into the right. They see YouTube videos, stuff that we have created, and they see a new perspective. To Turkish, what is it the Turkish coast? It's because of YouTube's algorithm to be honest. It will taken them down an even more extreme path. The first arguments that they hear... maybe Islam should be questioned, maybe, you know, Trump isn't a terrible person, will take them to another YouTube video in their suggestions that tells them that Islam is cancer and it's the worst thing ever. It doesn't seem so radical anymore. Those views don't seem so fringe anymore because they're one click away on YouTube. And go. LAUREN: We then traveled up to the Turkish Bulgarian border where we were detained for 10 hours and questioned for our journalism. CAOLAN: Cool. LAUREN: We've confronted the politicians, we've traveled with the migrants, we've infiltrated the NGOs and we have located the traffickers and we are going to expose them all. "Borderless" is, it's a documentary about migration, how migration is impacting Europe, how it's changing the culture. Well, your kids, your grandkids, they're going to have to deal with this. They're going to be in neighborhoods where maybe even Sharia becomes a legitimate legal practice because of the amount of, sheer amount of Muslims that have migrated to your community. There's a threshold, there's a threshold and people don't get that. Democracy isn't always a good thing and you actually have to make sure the people you surround yourself with are good people if you want to live in a democratic, Western free nation. I mean, gang rape is an inherently democratic process. It's nine people voting against one on what they want to do. There's some good French culture right there. Does this feel like Paris to you? GEORGE: Such a shit hole. LAUREN: Yeah, so I think maybe I would just... we can do local interviews later. I think it would be good today just to see the camp. It'd be really cool. MAN: You're looking only for migrant people? Or I mean illegal migrant people? LAUREN: Illegals. Yes. Right there. You see the park? Got it. Getting it. Getting it. Getting it. Oh shit. Yeah. This is a great shot. If you can get this. Oh, there's a bunch of tents on... Oh shit. That's a whole tent area down there. Yeah, they've got a ton of tents. If we can go under that bridge. Can I get Camel cigarettes? All right. Hopefully we will have some very happy migrants. Yeah, we may go. You got my audio? Yeah. I can see it there. Cool. Nice to meet you. I'm Alex. I want to know your story. I want to understand your story. I'm learning a lot about all the people here in Paris that have come here for a new life. Where do you guys get the wood? MIGRANT: We go and find it. LAUREN: You go and find it? Anyone from Sierra Leon? Was it scary going on the boats? MIGRANT: You didn't want to remember that journey. LAUREN: You don't want to think about it? MIGRANT: Yeah, because it's very... LAUREN: You guys like chocolate? MIGRANT: Yeah. LAUREN: Yeah. You like chocolate too. MIGRANT: Now, I can give you 10 minutes. LAUREN: Would you ever go back? MIGRANT: For now, I don't think I want to go back for now because my life is in danger that's why. LAUREN: Right, right, hmm. Does he miss his home country? LAUREN: I think that's amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Big help. As much as I can sit down and I can sympathize and I can have conversations... I can have cookies with these people and hear their life story, that doesn't mean we suddenly... just because I feel bad in that moment, we need to destroy all borders and allow everyone to come in here. It doesn't work like that. Everyone's got a... Everyone's got a story. Everyone's got a heart. I mean, they're all people, but, um, it's just an overall bad situation for everyone. If you don't try to have some order to it all. TRUMP: Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan, isn't that nice, of illegal aliens to flood into our country and overwhelm your communities. That's what's happening, have you seen the pictures? LUCIAN: We're seeing our messages, almost everywhere now. They have gone sort of mainstream. But then at the same time, yeah, we end up being sort of drowned out in a river that we created. RICHARD: Hi everyone, this is Richard Spencer. I am under attack and I need your help. Some of the biggest and baddest law firms in the United States are suing me, and other prominent figures in civil court. 2018 has been one of the hardest years of my life. I've had a failed marriage, multiple lawsuits. I can't raise money in the way that I had been. I'm being treated like a terrorist. There was a tremendous assault on me from within the movement. "You're a narcissist, it's all about you." And I've just never been put through this shit. And I don't know, it's just awful. A lot came together in 2016 and 2017, where, like, what I was doing and the movement were in align... and Trump, and that was amazing and it just felt... An amazing feeling of power, of winning. Of just clicking, you know, and I now feel like the movement is going one way, I'm going one way, and Trump is going one way, and I just kind of have to be at peace with that. MIKE: There was a sense of optimism that I don't think is necessarily present anymore. I don't see the point in all this bullshit. I got the "New Yorker" profile, the "60 Minutes" feature, "HBO Vice," books about me written up in every publication, been on the front page of the "New York Times." It doesn't make you a dollar. I need people buying my books, buying my video courses, coming to my seminars. That's what I need from people. I'm going to try and hide this thing here. I have some hair. I don't want to look too desettled. Here we go. I'm not looking my absolute best, but you know, whatever. It's reality of a similitude. All right, we're live? DANIEL: Yeah. MIKE: I started a supplement company that probably people go, "Oh, you're just trying to cash in" or whatever. The signature product is Gorilla Mind, which is an atropic. And then we have a skincare product, a facial serum that works quite well and it's actually selling well. So a year from now, I will ideally only be selling facial skincare products. They're high margin, low risk. Should put some of this on. Actually, I forgot to put it on this morning. My pivot now is more towards doing my mindset seminars again, the kind of things that you just do and it isn't like a media thing. MAN: All right, y'all we're about to get started, so everybody could sit that'd be dope and that's right there. BRANDON: All right, so the solution is, something I call “M-M-M”. Anybody who's not on my team knows what M-M-M stands for? Yes? CROWD: Make more money. BRANDON: Make more money! That's right. That's right. Your event starts tomorrow or it's already started? MIKE: Tomorrow, yeah. It's just the one day 11:00 to 4:00. BRANDON: Okay. Cool. MIKE: General tickets' like 70 bucks cheap, dinner, 500. And then I always have a $1,000 ticket for like a private one on one. BRANDON: Do you sell some of those? MIKE: Yeah. Yeah. I always do. 80-20 rule. BRANDON: Nice. I didn't think about that, man. Someone always buys. MIKE: They always buy it and moreover it makes everything else look cheaper. BRANDON: You make a lot of money off the dinners, man. MIKE: Yeah. You know, it all began when demons were cast out on my mother. But that's where it begins. My mother is bipolar and we would go to house churches and the evangelical community I grew up in, they believed that mental illness was actually demonic possession. So there was an exorcism and she was demonically unpossessed. I watched her go into the room with the preacher man and he showed us his bottle of pills that he shook. I always remember, I remember that clinking sound and he goes... I used to take blood pressure medication, diabetes medication, but God healed me and I quit taking it. So my mom quit taking lithium. A week or two later, my mom was in a mental institution, and that man said, "I never told her to quit taking her medication. I never told her to quit taking her medication. She just decided to." And I was the only other person in the room. How many people do you think took responsibility for that? Right? How many people said we told her to do that. We feel, how can we help you? None. So for me, that was like a very traumatic memory in a way, but I rewrote it in a positive way, right? So the way I rewrote was, you know, it was an amazing experience for you to learn as a young child that you can't rely on other people. That's why people, people don't like the term brainwashing, but I've said, "I'm not here to brainwash you. I'm here to teach you how to brainwash yourself." What people understand is simultaneous truth. So people say, Mike Cernovich is like an angry guy. I don't believe I even said anything ever bad, in my own mind. I would pass a lie detector. I'm like, "I don't even know what you're talking about." They're like, "But, but... I'm like, "What are you talking about? Like the past isn't real. It's just a figment of your imagination. It's a memory." Right? MAN: I went to his night for freedom and I was just blown away by the caliber of people that he attracted to the event, not just him, everyone involved. And so I said the next time there was a chance to come to see a mindset seminar, I was going to come and see it. MAN 2: I would say Mike Cernovich is a success maker and reading his book about how you can change your life by your mindset. That's why I'm here. And I want my son to hear that message, not only from me barking at him all day, but from somebody else. MIKE: People view me as this really inspirational, cultural movement leader or whatever. I don't really feel that way. I'm not someone who likes myself particularly much. I could play up the A-fact and everything in the pro wrestling thing, but I'm not somebody who wakes up and thinks, "I really like me. I really like this person." SHAUNA: We moved to a new house, so this is our lovely yard. We have a salt water pool and a salt water hot tub. Michael's literally in here every single night. MIKE: Yeah. Shauna had wanted me to buy a house. I'm against home ownership actually, but she sold me on it. Hot tub. Everything. This is me in studio, so this is a nice set up. I take the smooth because I don't like a lot of caffeine. Other people take the rush because they like the caffeine. So for that there's a bundle. The bundle is the best deal. Two bottles, 50 bucks, 25 bottles, each. SHAUNA: He doesn't Periscope as often, which I kind of like. I don't know. We'll see. I have all these screenshots that I always like take. He's like, "Shawna, after this we're done. We're out of politics." I'm like, "Screenshot, screenshot," just like show him, but I'm like, "I don't see you." DANIEL: He's told me that too. SHAUNA: Yeah, and I feel like he wants to, but I just don't see it happening. LAUREN: I'm here to give a speech at the European union on my recent project, "Borderless", my movie on immigration to Europe. JANICE: Brexit, we took the first brick out of the wall, and then we had the fantastic election of Mr. Trump. And you've Victor Orban in Hungary, you've got the PIS party in Poland. You know, these people are running governments now. LAUREN: Thank you for coming, I'm well. JANICE: Lauren has tapped into the zeitgeist at the moment. MAN: It's only about five minutes. Just do last minute preps. LAUREN: Okay. So we'll start in like five? MAN: Yes. Uh-huh. LAUREN: Hi. Thank you for coming. JANICE: Well, ladies and gentleman, welcome and colleagues. Welcome to this screening of Lauren Southerns very important film. It's a film that the mainstream media to have dared not to make and will not make so we have to do it. And I hand over to Lauren Southern. It's your floor. LAUREN: For the last 12 months, I backed away a bit from in your face trolling style of politics. My focus has been on immigration and culture and the upheaval that comes when the balance between these two things is upset. Making sure that some of these heartbreaking chilling and totally not unique stories of cultural destruction, migrant crime and lies and upheaval were being heard. People are engaged, people want the truth and they are ready for it. Europe is a continent in crisis. In fact, Europe is a continent in the midst of several crisis, from questions about its conscience, it's political ideas, it's humanitarian responsibilities to the rest of the world. How or if at all it is going to enforce its borders and the massive demographic changes that it is facing. These are some of the most dramatic changes Europe has ever faced, but this change has been a long time coming. LAUREN: Do you regret leaving Afghanistan? LAUREN: Are they refugees? I can't sit here and lie to you and pretend that they were. MAN: You're very big in (inaudible) by the way... LAUREN: Well I think... WOMAN: She's pretty big in the US too. LAUREN: Thank you. MAN: Well done. LAUREN: Thank you. MAN: That was really... You have a good speech writer. LAUREN: Aw. I think in certain phases of this kind of political journey, for me it's gone like up and down. There have been phases where you get so high on the likes and follows and supports and people telling you you're saving the world, that you just keep going, keep going, keep going, and it's like a drug. I feel a little bit guilty to an extent because I constantly have people telling me, "Oh, Lauren, that girl, she's going to achieve so much. She's going to be changing the world. She's only 23 and look what she's done so far. She's going to... really, just the stuff she's going to do in the future is going to be incredible." And so many people that just believe in me and what I do, but I'm like I... My entire adult life has been in politics. My entire adult life, I've been a internet figure or social media character since I was 19-years-old. I haven't gotten to be a person. Most people were happy for me. They were like, "Go live your life. You have your family, you go to school and do what's best for you." Most people were happy for me, but there were definitely people that were angry and saw me as kind of a trader. "How dare you turn your backs on us?" I have a lovely boyfriend that I'm going to be getting married to. And I honestly, I don't want to talk about it that much because I actually really value this relationship and so I don't want it anywhere near politics. I hope to be a wise mother. To be a minority can lead to oppression. So what does that mean if whites become the minority in a nation where white people are to an extent demonized? What does that mean for the welfare of my children? MAN: Your current boyfriend is not white. LAUREN: I don't think it would be endearing to put such an emphasis on that, you know, because it doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is he's the best person I've ever met. Like he would watch this and be like, "Why would you make that a thing?" DANIEL: Sure. LAUREN: You know, because it's not... Not, it doesn't matter. DANIEL: Sure. RICHARD: I'm spending most of my time in Montana. I've, in a way, gone into a bit of a cocoon. Some people could take that as like, "Oh he's disappeared, or he's gone off into the wilderness," but that's absolutely not how I view it. If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, "All gays should marry." You actually would probably get a lot of laughs. Maybe in 10 years from there, you would get fewer laughs and maybe even a couple of supporters. MAN: Yeah! Seig Heil! RICHARD: By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. LAUREN: We are in a new age of nationalism and We're certainly in a new age of what it means to be right wing. (yelling inaudibly) RICARD: We've really entered the mainstream, and we're not going away. BANNON: Let them call you racist, let the call you xenophobes. Wear it as a badge of honor. Because every day we get stronger and they get weaker. LAHERN: They wanna open our borders you better be sure that the people of Texas, the people of South Dakota, the people in the middle of this country, we are going to be armed and ready. because we have to have a means to defend ourselves from who knows who's coming, and that's the thing, we don't know. INGRAHAM: Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being honest with people. MALE REPORTER: It is an invasion. MALE REPORTER 2: It's a flat out invasion. TRUMP: I don't care what the fake media says, that's an invasion of our county. RICHARD: Violence is a part of history, and there's no question that there will be, and I don't say this because I want it at all, but there will be blood and tears as the current paradigm breaks down. MALE REPORTER: 11 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in the Tree of Life Synagogue during service this morning. Now Bowers told officers after that gun battle that he wanted all Jews to die, and that Jews were committing "genocide" to his people. MALE REPORTER 2: Some of the rhetoric that you see on the suspects social media profile, talking about invaders, talking about illegals. This is also what you hear on the far right. MALE REPORTER 3: A gunman with an automatic weapon has opened fire on a mosque in central Christchurch. FEMALE REPORTER: The writer called for violence against immigrants, calling them invaders. MAN: Go, go, come on! MALE REPORTER: This was the horrific scene at the Wal-Mart here in El Paso, Texas. FEMALE REPORTER: The gunman is believed to have written a racist, anti-immigrant document. MALE REPORTER: This country has seen a rise in violence by white supremacists. MALE REPORTER 2: The number of hate groups is growing, from 784 documented in 2014 to over a 1,000 nowadays. MALE REPORTER 3: The country has more hate groups than the Southern Poverty Law Center has ever counted. MAN: Hate crimes are on the rise in the U.S. and Europe and continue to rise every year. Do you think that your rhetoric contributed to that climate? LAUREN: So if anything I've said has contributed to that, it was because someone misinterpreted me. RICHARD: No, I don't feel responsible because people have to listen to what I'm saying. And if anyone engaged in aggressive violence against others, that they have totally misunderstood me, and in a way disobeyed me. MIKE: Do I wish I'd have never trolled? Do I wish I did never told bad jokes? Do I wish I'd never done, you know, satire, edgy commentary or whatever? And I honestly think the answer is no. I know that what I'm saying is essentially agenda driven, but I'm a good guy too and I've said a few dodgy things over the years. Fuck you. ♪ ♪ RICHARD: Oof. ♪ ♪ Well, in the ethnostate that I won't experience, but my grandchildren will. Yeah, there'll be a Richard Spencer Boulevard and there'll be a magnetic levitation train flying down and bringing all citizens of the ethnostate to an amazing world art museum, something like that. That would be great. (music plays through credits)
