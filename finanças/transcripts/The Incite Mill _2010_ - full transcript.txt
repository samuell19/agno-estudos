Incite Mill I'm sorry. Job Info Food Prep Staff 750 yen/hour Kitchen Staff 750 yen/hour General Labor 800 yen/hour Nothing good... Excuse me. Yes? Looking for a part-time job? Yeah, I guess so. Can I ask a question? Sure, ask me anything. What do you think about this job? 1,120 yen / hour (x100) Hourly rate is 1,120 yen... ...times 100? So, that's... 112,000 yen per hour! Impossible! I ended up applying, Even though it's a bit suspicious. Same with me. I look forward to working with you for seven days. Like wise. How's it doing? General Pharmaceuticals Stock report Yu, its okay. This job will solve everything. 2.68 million yen per day for each of us. That's a total of over 16 million yen each! This work sure pays well. She doesn't seem like a part-time worker. Suspect Escapes, Possibly Injured. Random attack on Aoyama Street. Still no trace of suspect. Welcome to the Interacticum Foundation Experiment. As you have been told... ...this experiment is to gather psychological data... ...over a period of seven days. You will be monitored by camera 24 hours a day... ...with in our facility until the experiment ends. Wow. We will be unable to answer any questions during the experiment. To begin, please place all person al belongings in the lockers. Even my cell phone? What about valuables? I brought all this stuff for nothing. And finally, please heed this warning. You may encounter immoral and irrational situations beyond this point. Immoral? Proceed only if you are prepared to accept that. Wow, check it out! DAY ONE What's the bottom number? I have no idea. This is over the top for a psychological experiment... I guess they want us to eat this! Ten figurines. You're right. And ten of us. Five male, five female. These symbolizes us? Hey, wait. Just tasting for poison. I'm starving. You want some, old man? Old man? Make sure he doesn't sit near me. This is good! - Yu, try the bread. - Thanks. It's so good. You a student? Does your family know about this? That's none of your business. You're so tense. Do you dislike people? You should care about your family. I'm separated, haven't seen my daughter for three years. Everyone. Since we'll be here for a week, perhaps we should introduce ourselves. Great idea! I agree, let's do that. I'll start us off. I'm Yu Dai Osako, a medical intern. Ooh. I signed up because the concept intrigued me. I'm Wakana Tachibana, a nail stylist. My dream is to marry Yu. Yukito Maki. I came for the money. I'm Miya Sekimizu, a web designer. I'm Iwai. Go ahead. I'm Shoko Suwana, a former secretary. I'm Yuki, I do freelance work. I want money for a car. I feel out of place, since you are all so young. I'm Sawako Fuchi, a housewife from Setagaya. Wow, ritzy neighborhood! Oh, me? I'm Munehiro Nishino. I worked in a supermarket, but they downsized. Then I drove a taxi, and after that... and finally, who are you? I'm Ando. The architectural firm I managed went bankrupt. I'm here for the money as well. He's a bit awkward. Welcome to the Paranoia House. This place is a microcosm of the world. Welcome to the Paranoia House. "Paranoia House"? This place is a microcosm of the world. It's this. You can listen to me while you eat. Let me introduce your assistant. What is it? You can call it Guard. Guard does odd jobs, and will protect you. Protect us? From what? I'll explain the rules that you must all obey. There is only one obligation. You must remain in your own room after 10:00 p.m. If you're found outside, Guard will eliminate you! "Eliminate"? If a crime occurs, please solve i t. What do you mean, a crime? The person who solves the crime is the detective?/i> Any one of you can be the detective. Once a solution is proposed, everyone will vote on i t. We just vote on it? How innovative. If then a majority agree... ...the detective will sentence the criminal to prison. Guard will assist with that. One last thing. The experiment ends when either seven days have passed... ...or when only two survivors remain... ...and we determine that it is not feasible to continue. "Survivors"? My explanation of the rules is complete. Have a great time! Our own rooms? We have to be alone in our rooms? No way! It's not a big deal. Our job is simply to stay here for seven days. That's true. Nothing is going to happen. What if one of us is a psychopath? Oh, come on. Think about it. What if it's true? No worries about food. Even if we found out, we can't call the police for seven days. Well, just in case... Let's agree not to harm each other. Like a peace treaty? What's the point? We'll need mutual trust to stay together for seven days. Maybe that's why we're here? To see if strangers will establish trust over seven days. Perhaps. That makes sense. All right, let's agree. Your free time begins now. Take your card key from the wall, and get to your room by 10:00 p.m. If you don't do so, you'll be disqualified... ...and Guard will eliminate you! You're good at this. Just part of being a housewife. You should roll up your sleeves, they'll get wet. Are you hiding scars? You have a child, don't you? Profiling is my hobby. You're young, but your hands are rough and not manicured. Designer clothes, but worn out. I can tell... Weren't you in the newspaper? Some crime... I know! You look like the principal that abused a kid at her nursery school! What non sense is this? That's not me! I only said that you resemble her... Did I upset you? Sorry about that. What's with that guy? Can you finish here? You're not an intern. I will be after the exam. We have to vote in case of a crime. If something happens, they'll all trust a doctor. Hey there. So, regarding the rules here... If there's trouble, We have to decide by voting. She and I will always back each other. You follow? So you have an advantage? Smart kid. Why don't you join our team? I'll consider it. Hey. You know that old guy, Ando? You know who he looks like? That serial killer from Nara. Huh? And that Iwai might be the Aoyama Street attacker. He's got a cold. Probably been living on the streets. Thanks for backing me up earlier. Sure. This must be the game room. Yu, come and play this. I'm good at it. Yeah? I've never played. You turn this, right? This is hard! Hey, there's alcohol here! I was told not to bring any. Wish I could stop... Maybe you should. I've stopped before, but had withdrawal symptoms. My hands trembled, and I had hallucinations. Don't worry, I'm not a bad drunk. The key to quitting drinking is not along-term plan. You have to decide each morning that you won't drink for that one day. My dad had a drinking problem too. But he managed to abstain, one day at a time. It worked. Really? Abstain on a day by day basis. Perhaps I'll try it. Yes. What are these? They're all detective items. So many mystery books. That's great. Oh, I wanted to read this. Go ahead. Thank you. Do you like mysteries? Yes. Time to sleep. Time to sleep. Everyone, please go to your own room. We have adjoining rooms. Seems like it. Good night. Uh... It'll be okay. Call me if you need help. Well, I'm not particularly useful... That's not true. Please help me if I need it. There's no lock? What is this? What's this for? Beat to Death Fire Poker ("Speckled Band") "Beat to Death." "Speckled Band"? Time for lights off. Time for lights off. DAY TWO Good morning. Good morning. Sorry to startle you, I didn't mean to intrude. I did knock, but there was no reply. It's fine. Did you... ...look inside of the box? There's one in your room also? Yes. What...? Nishino. From this moment, the Paranoia House changed. You're a doctor, check him! He was shot. Chest and stomach, five shots. So there must be a gun? I didn't hear anything. You can't hear anything With the doors closed. But who? Why! This... This can't go on. You're watching from somewhere! Hey! End the experiment! Let us out! Someone is dead! End the experiment! Hey! Actually... Isn't it just starting? This experiment. Let's check Nishino's box. Poisoning - Cyanide "Poisoning." But he was killed by gun shots... "Mystery of the Green Capsule"? John Dickson Carr...? It seems to be... ...dented. What are these? Coffins. Eight of them? Why? This is going to continue? We haven't found the gun. We still haven't checked... ...What's inside the boxes in each room. A gun and a poison capsule... We all have something. A tool... ...that can be used for killing. Inside those boxes. Time for solution. Time for solution. The detective, criminal, and corpse receive bonuses. A bonus for the criminal? Bonus is double pay. But what is the point of a bonus to a corpse? Detective bonus makes sense. Someone solves it and determines the criminal. Then you throw the min jail. It's simple. Shall we just keep living with the killer? Six days still remain. I know who seems suspicious. The criminal... ...is you! Huh? Me? Nishino thought that you were the Aoyama Street attacker. That's ridiculous. Everyone, as detective, I've solved this crime. The rules require that we vote on it. Wait a minute. We can't just accuse someone. What about yesterday's trust? Someone is dead! We can't get out. - Everything has changed. - I oppose your solution! We can't do this, we can't! We have to calm down and figure out the facts. Yeah, that's it! The boxes. We'll check the boxes and find out who's got the gun! That will tell us, right? Right? Think we'll show them so easily? Impossible. After all... ...a killer is amongst us. If he or she knows our weapons, they'll target the weak first. Right, it's better if none of us know. That way we'll... So we have deterrence? I don't want to show. All oppose disarming. So let's vote on my solution. Who agrees that Iwai did it? You showed up late... ...When we found the body, and you weren't... ...surprised by the corpse. So you're all in on this against me, huh? You! Four agree, and who's against it? I'm against it! Possible suspects can't vote. I'm against it. I'm also against it. Against it. What's going on? You're acting crazy. Four versus three. Interesting game. How about you? You can make it four versus four. This vote would be a draw. Actually... I'll pass. Four agree, three against. One will pass. Osako's solution is approved. Imprisonment! You can't be serious! Wait! Stop this! I didn't kill Nishino! I don't have a gun! I'll remember this, Osako! Hey! Release me! It's been changed... I've been set up? Who did this? Eight of us remain. Are you all right? Congratulations, Osako, you get a detective bonus! Double pay! Ha-ha-ha! I'll get over 32 million yen! That's great! And Iwai gets double pay as the criminal! This is a great place for people who kill for money. Yeah. I'm abstaining, one day at a time. Perhaps... ...We should look into Iwai's box. To see if he actually has a gun. So where is the gun? Iwai didn't have it. The criminal with a gun is still among us? Continuing to investigate will just provoke the real murderer. It's better to just wait out the remaining six days. Let's quit while we're ahead. People have died. It's not just a game. You two are crazy! Everyone. Let's remain level headed. The ingredients are pre-cut. I'm telling this to only you. To be honest, I have the gun. Someone put it into my box. Do you believe me? I believe you. I'm sorry. Why apologize? If I hadn't approached you in the store... ...you wouldn't have been involved in this. Don't worry about that. I... Wow, you two hit it off. What are you discussing? Please fill in for me. Hey! This is Suwana's room. She's in the kitchen, right? What's that for? I'm going to look for the gun. I was afraid it wouldn't work. Do you suspect Suwana? Those ten Indians... And Then There Were None. It's an Agatha Christie parody. Only a fan of mystery stories would come up with that. Hold on, Ms. Fuchi! Suwana isn't like that. Oh, you can tell? So, how do I seem? You're a wealthy housewife. I run a take-out lunch place and have five kids. Look out for yourself. In a situation like this... ...only those with the strongest will to live can survive. No shots fired. Continued in the Final Volume Oh... DAY THREE Ms. Fuchi... Her box... ...was empty also. Wakana! I can't stand it! We'll all be killed! Calm down! It's okay. I'm here, its okay. Yu, I don't want to die! Please calm down. Don't touch me! Wakana! I'm scared... Does this belong to you? Who is most likely to be Ms. Fuchi's killer? It's you, the one she suspected, Shoko Suwana. Ms. Fuchi suspected me? That's hear say! It's true. Yesterday I saw the feet of a woman fleeing. That's true. I saw her too. That's a lie! - Let's vote on it. - Wait, this is absurd. - And let the killer go free? - No, you're mistaken! Are you the killer? Why don't you confess? Who decided that!? This was in my box. It's not the killer's weapon. Shoko Suwana. Prove to us your innocence by showing us your weapon. Out of my way, coward. Sometimes cowards are strongest. You fools! Want to get us killed? Shut up! Put this away! You're suspicious too! She's right. Why would a man of your age sign up for this job? Because my son... ...died here six months ago. The last time I saw him... ...he'd found a job that paid over 110,000 yen per hour. I was too busy working to pay attention. I came to see for myself what happens here. Seeing all of you convinced me. Everyone here, along with my son... ...tore each other apart. This isn't the first experiment? No. And now we are also headed for the same fate. Osako had a knife. Nishino had poison. The killer took Fuchi's weapon... Why didn't the killer take Nishino's too? Please don't startle me. I was wondering if we should start a patrol during the night. A patrol? Yes, through the corridors. Last night I calculated Guard's patrol cycle. I found that guard goes around precisely every ten minutes. And what's more... It's always in a clockwise direction. Never counterclockwise. We should be fine. Thanks for what you did earlier. For supporting me. I really didn't do much. After all, I'm a coward. That's not true. Well, maybe a little bit. But that's because you dislike conflict. Oh. I've been watching you all along. You're very kind. What is it? I don't know. Let's go. Why is it going counterclockwise? In here! Shift change. You're alone? Wakana hasn't shown up. What!? Maybe she's asleep? I'll go along. You can go. All right. - Be careful. - Okay. - Hey, wait. - I have patrol duty. A bit more... No, it's weird doing it here. This place does give me the creeps. Real creepy. DAY FOUR It's Osako. This is what got him. The suspended ceiling. But... ...I don't see any switch. This is Osako's. The one with the weapon dies. How ironic. You're a liar. You said that guard only goes clockwise! What? You suspect me? Who did this, then? Who did this...? Who did this to you? We were supposed to leave... and get married... I'll kill your killer. I'll kill the one... ...Who killed you! Wakana! The remote! It was you? No, it wasn't me! You killed Osako with this? No, it's not mine! This is mine! Not that you'd believe me! Stop it! Stop! Wakana! That's intense! Shoot to Death - Crossbow ("Bishop Murder Case") It seems that Maki really did just pick up that remote control. Obviously it wasn't Wakana. So, somebody else killed Osako. That means... ...the killer is still alive. There's more than one killer. Already been here for four days. Four days without drinking, too. It'll become easier after this. Don't give up. The same goes for the rest of us, if we just get through this. I hope so. Let's believe so. What do you think of this place? Mysteries are fun because they are fictional. But making them a reality... ...is madness. That's true. But having such adversaries... ...is a test of our true inner strength. What is that strength? I suppose that I'm just talking the talk. After losing my son, I drowned myself in alcohol. I hope that we can just get through three more days. I won't give up. I have to see my son. You have a son? He really needs me. I have to survive. See you tomorrow. Will we meet tomorrow? I'm sure we will. Good night. Time for lights off. Time for lights off. Good night. Can we talk? Talk about what? I want you to tell me... ...about this. When I was a child, all I Wanted to do... ...was to die. I didn't get along with my parents. They beat me a lot. But now you want to live, and return home. That's right. Having a son really changed me. Want to see? He needs a heart transplant, overseas. Time is running out. I don't want him to suffer anymore. I'm determined to be stronger. If something happened to me, my son... So you killed her? When you said that you'd see your son, no matter what... I knew that you killed Fuchi. She told me... ...that only those with the strongest will to live can survive. Let's stop this killing. If you believe that I did it... ...Tell the others your solution. No... That's not what I... It's a muscle relaxant. Muscle relaxant? I got it from Fuchi's box. I'm glad it was so effective. This is my weapon. I was afraid of Fuchi. You look like the principal that abused a kid at her nursery school! What nonsense is this? That's not me! I was... ...so afraid of her. So afraid. You're wrong. She wasn't... Can you please... ...just stay still. I have to go home no matter what. For my son. No matter what. Warning. Please enter your room. Warning. Please enter your room. You will be eliminated. Warning. Please enter your room. No further warnings. It seems to be... ...dented. DAY FIVE Ando. She gave us a muscle relaxant. What happened? She was shot by guard. Guard killed her. Guard did it? There was no criminal. Guard killed her. Nishino, too. There was poison in His box. It was... Dented. As if bitten. Bitten? Maybe he tried to drink it. Suicide? But why? I Don't know. For the corpse bonus. He wanted money. What's the point, if you're dead? He Wanted to leave money to someone. Perhaps he came here to die. Maybe this Foundation sent him here to be the first Victim. He was trying to antagonize us. You know who he looks like? That serial killer from Nara. That was also a ploy set up by the Foundation. We reacted just as the Foundation expected. Suspiciously searching for a criminal who didn't exist. Then, the next killing occurred. Because Sekimizu was afraid of Fuchi. She just wanted to get money for her son. I'll never forgive them. Doing this to us! Your solution is acknowledged. Yuki gets two detective bon uses, quadruple pay. - Your total is 43 million... - Shut up! ...392,000 yen. We should have just been forth right. We should have given up our Weapons, rejected the game, and shown mutual trust. It's not too late. Let's get rid of our weapons. No more detective games! Suspicion led to the killings. What about Osako's suspended ceiling? Who did it? I don't know, but please trust me. I'll show you my weapon. I don't need it. I'll sleep well to night, suspecting no one. Wait! My weapon. My abstinence is going well. I'll try trusting you. It's been a while since anyone... ...Has shown concern about my health. Not since my son died. I'll sleep well also. DAY SIX Oh, you're awake? I had breakfast already. Good morning. Good morning. She made us breakfast. If I had a newspaper, this would be a regular house hold morning. And no gun, too... Oh. I woke up this morning wanting to leave here alive. I was surprised. I came here to die. I didn't care after my son had died. I criticized him for his meager income. That's why he took this job. I'm guessing that that's the number of viewers who are watching us. It's steady now, but it spiked when ever someone died. So many people... They're probably broadcasting it globally. They use that income to fund this operation. That's how we get paid. Let's show the world that we won't give in. We have to survive. DAY SEVEN Suwana? Ando? Ando? Ando! How'd you get out? The Door simply opened. You did that to Ando... Nope, didn't kill Ando. I killed Osako. His arrogant attitude really pissed me off, man. The remote control did the job. You're the Aoyama Street attacker. Give me the gun, I want a criminal bonus! The gun you killed Ando with! I didn't do it. It was you... Stop screwing around! I know it was you! Where's the gun? I don't know! I didn't do it. You really didn't? Well neither did I! I was watching you guys from prison. You sure do like killing each other. Well, I like it too! I love it! I love this place! You're the same. You're the one that killed Ando. Tell me the truth! I didn't do it. Please drop it. Please drop it. I will shoot. You'll shoot me? Stop! Can you do it? It's not easy to kill someone. Well, it is for me. Come on, go ahead! Don't you have the guts? I will shoot. Stop it! Don't shoot! Listen. Iwai, listen to me. Don't do what the Foundation wants. The only way to survive here is by trusting each other. Don't do it! What happened? Yuki, did you alter the gun? I Didn't. Ando must have. You solved it! Detective bonus to Yuki, your pay is doubled again! Ando gets double pay as the criminal! Time's up! Game over! Game over! Game over! Your old man survived. Mr. Rikuhiko Yuki. Your pay is 129,024,000 yen. It's yours. Shoko? I work for the Foundation. My job is to increase the number of viewers. That's why I let Iwai out of prison. You're lying. I put the gun in your box. Wait! Why'd you lure me into this? Cowards tend to do well in our experiment. Why did you help me? Man, it's really good. It's really good to be alive. You're the one who said it.
