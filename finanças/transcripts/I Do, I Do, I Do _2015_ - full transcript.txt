You know, I wasn't always scared of the water. As a kid, I went swimming all the time. And then one day, I just looked at the water, and decided it was unsafe. You know? It was dangerous and risky and... I know that doesn't make any sense. ♪ ♪ Okay. Thank you for the lesson. I have to go get married now. Okay. See you at the wedding. By the way, I love the speech that you're gonna make. It's very sweet. I haven't written that yet. And tomorrow, we go up to your waist! Fine. I'll wear my bathing suit. I can't believe I went swimming! I'm a swimmer! You're a fast learner. Actually, I'm not. It's been days of lessons. I was just scared. Yeah. We all are. It's what you do in spite of your fear that defines you. Peter told me your parents, they died in a car accident when you were pretty young. They were just on their way to the hardware store. I mean, if you can die while going to pick up lightbulbs, then nothing's safe. So that's when you made the decision to play it safe, not to take any risk, and live life by the numbers. And there's nothing wrong with that. That's smart. Yes, but it's also an illusion. I hate to break it to you, but you can make all the right choices, and live life within the lines, but life's still gonna happen to you, and you have no control over it. Okay, well, I have the illusion of control. What's the worst that could happen? I don't know. That's the problem. But it seems like you already went through the worst, and you made it through. Uh... so if you could go anywhere in the world, where would you like to go? Why? Just making conversation. Egypt. - Mm! - Cairo. I want to see the pyramid of Giza. That's the one in the middle, right? The biggest one? It's still intact. It's actually the oldest of the seven wonders of the world. It's breathtaking. You've been there? Yeah. Cairo's an amazing city. The architecture there is still standing after so long. That's actually why I wanted to be an architect. I want to be a part of something that's here after I'm gone. Well, the wedding's happening in a couple hours, so... Oh! No. I cannot go through with that wedding again. I know your mother means well, but it is... Okay, the dress... The dress is wrong, the flowers are horrible, the... the cake is sugar-free, gluten-free lemon. Who has a lemon wedding cake? That's just sad. My first dance is humiliating. I can't dance, everyone's looking at me. So learn to dance. Ha, ha. No, I'm serious. Anyone can learn to dance. My mother put Peter and I in six years of dance classes when we were kids. If I can teach you how to swim, I can teach you how to dance. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be getting ready for your wedding? You promised to teach me how to dance. I did? Okay, so I'm gonna put my hand on your waist, you put your hand up here on my shoulder, good. I'm gonna step forward. You step back with your right foot. And to the side. And back. And to the side. Good. Now, if only we had music. Not so tense. Relax your shoulders. I'm still horrible! I'll never get this. Well, it takes time. You've got to be willing to let go of fear and judgement and just move to the music. Okay. Okay, close your eyes. Now I want you to go back to when you were a little girl, just dancing in your room with your sister. There's no fear, there's no judgement... Just the joy of moving to the music. You know what? When I was really little, I wanted to be a ballerina. Really? I have no idea why I just told you that! I have never told anyone that. Dancing is very intimate. Okay, you tell me something you've never told anyone. ♪ ♪ And you had a huge crush on your third-grade teacher, and you never told anyone. What? How do you know that? Oh, I know about Rachel and Lily and Malina. Okay, so I haven't been very lucky in love, but neither have you, up until now. I mean, before my brother, you dated some epic losers. Wait! How did you know that? 'Cause you just told me. ♪ ♪ You're a wonderful dancer. I had a great teacher. Mm! And this is your first lesson? It feels like weeks of lessons. Hmm.

There has got to be a way to make this wedding better. ♪ ♪ Hi. Kate? Can you meet me in the lobby in 10 minutes? ♪ ♪ Mm. These smell so good. They do. These are my favorite. Those are my favorite! Do you remember when I was little and I broke my arm skating? Yes! Oh! You were so brave when they were putting on your little cast. You slept in a sleeping bag on the floor next to my bed for two weeks. I can't believe you remember this. You were so young! Daddy used to carry you back to your bed, but you'd come back. Well, I didn't want you to feel alone. I'm glad you are my sister. I love you. Oh! I love you, too. Okay, what should we do next? Mm! Try this one. It's like a surprise party for your mouth. Mm! So you're back to eating sugar and gluten and caffeine? Yeah, I'm... thank you. I eat everything today. I'll stop tomorrow if tomorrow ever comes. That is both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. I've realized you can color inside the lines all you want, but it doesn't keep you safe. It's all an illusion. Life just happens, and we just have to try and keep up. That's amazing. Mm! Try the key-lime. Mm! Mm. That is good. Mm-hmm! - Question... - Mm-hmm? Why are we here trying wedding cakes? Because I want to get the best one for my wedding. Right... But you realize that there is a wedding that is supposed to happen in an hour? A wedding for you and Peter, and they already have a cake and flowers and food... Yes, but I thought about what you said, and you were right... It's my wedding. Shouldn't I have everything the way I want it? Ah. True. I'm just worried that you might be losing your mind. I might be. But shouldn't we enjoy it? I wish mom were here to do this with us. She is here, because we are here and she's a part of us. ♪ ♪ It's... Pretty... But... I agree. Oh... Careful. ♪ ♪ That's the one. I agree! It's called the "Princess Dress." I love it! It's perfect. You look just like mom. She and daddy would be so proud of you. Oh, you look beautiful! When's the wedding? Today. Oh! Do you have a maid-of-honor dress that matches with this? Something that isn't pink. You know what? I think we do. I'll be right back. So... have you talked to Max since the kiss yesterday? Actually, I have. And? What's he like? He's intelligent and inspiring and compassionate. And he loves being a doctor and helping people. And he dances and he plays guitar and he loves children. You found all that out in one day? He sounds like a great guy. He really is. So? What are you gonna do about it? Nothing. He's Peter's brother. Yeah, but when you talk about him, your whole face smiles. This is gonna be the perfect wedding. Well... I'm just happy I got to help you plan it. Do you know what? If I had to live one day over and over again, I would live this one with you. Do you hear that, universe? If I have to live one day over and over again, I'd pick this one! Hello? Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Good morning, Linda. How's "Pepper" doing? - You know Pepper? - Of course, I know Pepper! You can't know Linda without knowing her puppy, Pepper. Can you connect me to Loretta the concierge? Hi, Loretta! This is Jaclyn Palmer in the bridal suite. Yesterday, I saw a dress in the wedding store. It's called the "Princess" gown and there's a blush-colored maid-of-honor dress that matches it. I need both dresses in a size four. Can you send someone down there with my credit card, and have them shipped to my room? Fantastic! I'm also gonna need some white roses and some orchids. They have them at the florist on main. I'd like them wrapped in white ribbon, and... You know, can you just come to my room with a pen and a pad of paper?

You'll have a heart attack! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ That was a wonderful wedding. My grandmother's still dancing. It was perfect. The dress and the flowers... The cake. Why'd you marry my brother? He... Asked? And it seemed like the answer to all my dreams, and he makes me feel safe and cared for. And that's enough for you? To feel "safe and cared for?" And he loves me. He doesn't try and change me. He accepts me for the way I am. Mostly. I just think... We have a really good chance of being happy. You seem like a strong, confident woman. And actually, you're just a coward. I'm a coward? Yes. You are. You took the easy way out. So what's wrong with that? I'll never be heartbroken, I will never feel hurt or disappointed, I will never have to lose someone who I can't bear to lose again. Yeah, that's true. But you'll also never know what it feels like to love with your whole heart. To know, in a single moment, what you've been missing for an entire lifetime. We just met, and I feel like I've known you forever. We just met, and I feel like we've taken a hundred long walks, and talked for a thousand hours. But Peter's my brother and now you're his wife...

I was thinking maybe we could go to Egypt for a honeymoon. You know I'm far too busy for a honeymoon. Well, not right now, but someday, I'd like to go to Cairo. I really want to see the pyramid of Giza. Why would you want to go to a city where everything is old? If we take a honeymoon anywhere, it's gonna be Hawaii. I think maybe we should've gotten to know each other a little better before we got married. We should have taken a hundred long walks and talked for a thousand hours. I thought we did.

Well, how do you know so much about me? Well, some things I know because you told me and some things I know from spending time with you. I've realized I think the most important thing in the world is having someone really know you. These are all my favorite foods. I know. Except for the beets. I-I don't like beets. Yes, you do. No, I don't. You don't like them because you haven't tried them, but last time we were here, you tried them and you liked them. Our last picnic, which was another day but is also today? Exactly. I like beets! Peter's a lucky man. I don't think he even wants to get married. Well, there's a way to tell if Peter's unsure of what he's saying. He smiles and he bites his lower lip. That's how I was always able to beat him at poker when we were kids. Hmm. Hmm. The most romantic day of the year is coming, and I wanted to know if... If you'll accept my proposal in making your dreams come true. Do you, Peter, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, forever and ever? I do. And do you, Jaclyn, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Why do you want to marry me? What? Why did you ask me to marry you? Because I love you? What is it that you love about me? Uh... You're really smart and you're pretty. Specifically, what is it about me that you love? I don't understand the question. What's my middle name? I don't know. Is that important? Why am I afraid of the water? Why did I become an architect? What's my favorite flavor of ice cream? Where do I want to live when we get old? How do I take my coffee? Should I know those things? I mean, won't we have an entire lifetime together to discover all of that stuff about each other? That "stuff" is what makes us who we are. It's why we fall in love with someone. Being known and loved for who you really are, that's what matters! She's crazy! Why are you doing this? You don't want to marry me. We barely know each other. You're only doing this because your mother convinced you it would help you make chief of the hospital. That is the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life! What's worse is that I don't think you even want that job. You're a good man and a great doctor. You love writing and traveling and being on TV. You don't want the responsibility of running a hospital. You want to be Dr. Phil! You don't know what you're talking about! Peter's dream is to run that hospital! No... ma. She's right. I don't. That's nonsense! You have the opportunity to have everything you ever wanted! No, ma. That's what you want for me. You have no idea what I want! Margaret! S-sit down. Peter... You are a wonderful man. But... I want true love... Messy, scary love that requires risk. Love that takes a leap of faith. You're right. I don't know if I'm ready to take that leap. But if I did, it would be with you. That's very sweet. Se qualcosa e giusta, ci si sente come in un bagno caldo. She said, if something is right, it should feel like you're getting into a warm bath. You speak Italian? Yes. My sister's so awesome! ♪ ♪ So that went well. I will apologize to your entire family. ♪ ♪ Do you think Peter's okay? He looks relieved. You were brave. You told the truth. That didn't come from your head, it came from the heart. You know me so well. I've only known you two days. That's not true. We've taken a hundred walks and talked for a thousand hours. That's impossible. You told me you'd say that, and I'm supposed to tell you that you became a doctor because of Sam. How could you... You didn't tell me what it meant. You just said to tell you it's because of Sam. Sam is this little boy that I met on my first trip to South Africa. He came in to the clinic where I was working and... I helped him get his first pair of glasses. And when he put 'em on, he started crying. And I asked him why, and he said because, up until that moment... He didn't know how beautiful the world could be. That little boy opened my eyes to a world that I'd never seen before... A world where you could make a real difference in people's lives. I'm so glad you told me that story. So we've known each other for a long time? We have. So now what? Well... We try to stay awake all night, to see if we can break the spell, but we fall asleep, and then I wake up back in the cabin, and we have to live this day all over again. Well, I don't mind.
