#HandballStrive Entrance exams are coming up. You only have two years left until college. Three years ago, students suffered from the earthquake. You're lucky compared to them. High school years are short. Use your time wisely. Three years ago, I volunteered to help out at the shelter... - Let's make this a good year. - Yes, sir! Going home already, lazy bum? I'm busy. Yeah, right. So cute! You guys look adorable! For real, look at this! You okay? Let's go. Masao, do you have a minute? See you later. Did you do the survey? Not yet. Okamoto turned his in. You need to decide by summer what your future plans... Masao, I'm talking to you. I'll die without this. Hey, don't run in the hallway! Okamoto: "At the place with connection." Okamoto: "At the place with connection." Hey, dance outside! Masao, I found it! - You did? - Yep, I connected. I'm glad there's free Wi-Fi. The only place on campus, too. Thanks a bunch. What did Guts want? My future plans survey. - What did you write? - Exams. Sorry, can you pass the ball? Thanks. Niiice pass! That shot reminded me of Taichi. Really? Look at this. Taichi became a key member as a second-year. It says he's handsome. I lost signal! We're out of range. Let's go back. Kiyota Kiyota How was your first day? It was okay. I'm with Okamoto again. And Kurosawa. Amazing. This must be fate. There's only four classrooms for each year. Are you playing Dutch ball this year? What's "Dutch ball"? You used to play with Taichi all the time. Thank you. Who's that? He's the boy that used to play Dutch ball with Masao. Passing through. Scoot in. It's dodgeball. Dutch ball, right? It's handball! Check your photos from three years ago. Three years... I look cooler here. Niiice. There you are. Jeez kid, you startled me. It's off-limits here. Thief. I'm trying to survive! Stop being so miserable. Wow, 35 likes. What happened? I only get three likes usually. But I got 35... - Now it's 36. - I don't get it. Here, this heart. The likes. Never mind, I gotta go. You like "likes"? What's a "like"? What's this "like" thing? It's 39... No way. I got 40 likes! Hey there Masao. Masao, good morning. I got 45 likes! Almost 50 likes. You're making history. My old photo looked cool with filters on, so I uploaded it. Good morning. Morning. You got tons of comments. Everyone's commenting on each other. I hit 50 likes. Masao, let's keep the ball rolling. Make a hashtag for it. How does it help? Putting hashtags makes it easier for people to look up keywords. "Cheering for Kumamoto." "Cheering for Kumamoto." This comment... How'd they know the place? I guess you can look up anything online. But, why cheer? There's temporary housing in the back. They thought this was recent. I see, then if that's the case... That employee doesn't care! Hey, they're in the same class as us. I forgot their names, though. Time for the name quiz! #HandballStrive! Giving our best in Kumamoto. - Nice. - Right? Let's do more. I used up all of my handball photos already. Oh, man... That sucks. I have a plan. Jump down. Okay. - Here I go. - Higher. Three, two, one... Niiice! That's it? It's a video. We'll capture the moment. This app's scary good. How'd you do it? Go here and click on this. After you do that, go here. And then... Pause it right there. Saving this. It changed colors. That's all it takes. Looks professional. You should be in a documentary. Yeah, with epic narration. Wow, that looks too cool to be me. In that case... "Reach. Connect." "Just like we used to." Sounds cool. "This is the sky of our motherland..." "Kumamoto!" Motherland! "And so, we ran. Faster than our words." "Without any help, the ball will roll away." Looks good. "Today is April 14th." That's all you wrote? How come? For this, little speaks more. Writing too much can be distracting. Leave room to imagine. Like how a strip tease is more exciting? Yep, pretty much. What! That's crazy! "Kuratan hyping it up for #HandballStrive!" Do you know this guy? Nope. A hype moocher. For sure. I guess we're trending now. This is my first time that I felt thankful for temporary housing. Big Bro! Pardon me. Don't just barge in. This used to be my room. Why're you here? Mom told me to come visit. I finally found it. Okamoto? From Okamoto Construction? The successor to the throne! Not exactly. Construction is nice. Earthquake means money. It's in high demand only for now. We're moving? I didn't know. We might be able to rent a room in Kengun with Hirota. Which Hirota? She's the loud one. I don't mind. I'm not moving. Is there enough work? I get paid well and not many people want my job. Funeral director, huh? And the best thing is, I get to drive a huge car. You're not happy we're moving? I just started to feel comfortable here. You always said you felt cramped. It's too sudden. I need to do something here. Why? You're not transferring schools. Let me guess. There's a girl that you like, huh? Was there a young girl around here? - Are we right? - Is it a girl? He's blushing! You're wrong! C'mon, stop... Big Bro, leave me alone! Hey. Do you... have time after class? It won't be long. I'll see you at the gym. - Hey, Nanao. - Good morning. Is this... social media stardom? Thank you for coming. Is this you two? You're Handball Strive? Handball Strive! A great name. And, this must be you. The hype moocher. I'm Shimada, a third-year. I welcome your passion! Nanao, we're starting. I'm coming. - I need to go. - Thank you so much. Take a look. In handball, you run! Jump! Throw! Like basketball and soccer, connecting the pass is crucial. At times, your heart connects the pass even without looking. You can carry the ball up to three steps, but any more... - Is traveling. - Correct! Handball Strive! Regarding body contact, you may touch as much as you please. That sounds perverse. The seniors graduated, and I became the only member. The boys' handball team was doomed, but that's when I saw it. What's this about? No clue. "Reach. Connect. Just like we used to." That's it! My search was over! Now everyone, let's handball strive together! Where's Kurahisa? He left. Are you guys interested... Nope. I don't wanna get hurt. Then, why post those pictures! Because playing a minor sport in this rural place is important! Japan is all about the big events, like the Olympics. Through social media, we push the insignificant to be important. That's why we have more than 10.000 followers. Soccer and basketball aren't unique enough. What was the passion that I felt? Well, I don't even play handball. Hold on a second. I'm begging you. Hey, wait up you two. Nanao. How did it go? He didn't make sense, so we declined. Masao, didn't you play handball? How did you know? Kurosawa said that you used to play with Toyama's key member. You uploaded those photos. Taichi was always really good. Oh, and Handball Strive! Thank you for getting people excited about handball. I'll strive to do my best. This photo... - It's boring. - Is it? I thought the tragic look would be instagrammable. People might've seen enough. Maybe handball is... getting old. We need a fresh take. Are you the younger brother? You look so similar. She's Teruyo. We went to the same high school. - I'm Masao. - Okamoto. You can call me Teruteru, you cutie boys. Do you like boobs? Boobs... What a lucky guy. Come and get 'em. Reach in. Just kidding! I'm sorry! - Those boobs are mine! - Forgive me! Isn't it crazy that he has to clean dead bodies? You can't laugh or cry while you're doing it. No emotion. I could never do that. I'd freak out and laugh. He used to dream of being a rock star. Huh? Big Bro said that? He wanted to change the world with music. Wait, you call him Big Bro? Sorry, I had to buy gifts. I told your rock star story. That's ancient history. Is it true? Why did you quit? After the earthquake, I stopped caring. I totally get it. Doesn't that piss you off? What can I do? There's no one to blame. Besides, I get fired up to drive and it's nice getting thanked. Time to head home. Inconsiderate. Am I? How come? I heard you quit handball. I wasn't good and I need to prepare for exams. Put your long and hard work into love. That sounds so wrong, you pervert. That's not what I meant. Or did you? Did I? Which do you think? So annoying. "Taichi commented: Speak up! Make yourself known!" Hello, Masao? Yeah. I got an idea. Hurry and get changed. We don't have our own room? For boys, the storage is our room. Okay, let's head over to practice. Captain! The gym... We can't use it. Follow me. The girls get to keep the gym to themselves? Are we there yet? We're almost there. This isn't the place? We're almost there. That's all he says. Here we are, the boys' handball court. This is just cruel. Let's get used to the ball. Don't move from there. Hold it for a second. Take a striking pose. Raise your arm higher. This is embarrassing. Spray him. That's good. Sweat of youth. Raise your leg higher. What are we doing? This is the start of our new chapter. "Strive in my final summer." Captain's dream became our next topic. Will the boys' handball team make it to the nationals? Be ready for his final summer. As for the girls, will they be able to surpass their record of top 16? Boys, move out of the way. I'm sorry. Red jacket's scary! That's why she's famous. By the way, who's our adviser? It's Mr. Yoshimuta. Barefoot sandal? Um... Mr. Yoshimuta? Sorry! Oh, Katayama. Ask me questions in class. I'm tired. Yes, sir. Form to re-join a club What's this? You're right, there's Wi-Fi here. You don't have a phone? Sorry for asking. Don't worry. Look at this comment. "You can do it!" That's nice of them. It feels strange, though. Hey, boys. I heard you're cheering for our team on social media. But, you need to... go fix this. My face looks puffy. Fix as in edit it? There's so much more you could do. We'll be careful. Okay, bye. Guys, do a better job next time. What's wrong, Kurosawa? I don't get what's so fun about phones. You don't like tech stuff. It's faster to speak directly. Not everyone can do that. What a pain. Isn't that Katayama? You said you had exams. My parents said I could join for a short while. Who's that? "Hyped for Kumamoto's handball scene!" "This teacher's hot!" "The flying Little Orihime LOL" Little Orihime. They're doing a good job. Well, I've gotta problem with it. What? I'm anxious that there are four members now. Why? If they manage to get five members, then they need to enter games. That jeopardizes my day off. You became an adviser so you could slack off. Yes. Want my well-trained team to beat those newbies to a pulp? All right! Boys' handball team, hey yeah hey! - Barefoot Sandal. - What is it? For this game, we're having Nanao join your team for a five-on-five. Did you plan this game for us? Let's win boys! If you lose, let's disband. Yes, we'll play as if our backs are against the wall. What's wrong? If we're all playing, who's recording? You're right, we're doomed. Sorry, can't play. Wait, I don't get it. - This is bad. - Excuse me. Would you like me to do it? You're the manager. I'm your follower. Handball Strive! Let's begin. Let's begin. Don't slow down. Go girls. Move your legs. More! You gotta go out further. Ouch. Run faster. That shot was weak. - Nice shot. - Niiice! Wake up! Pay attention! She's good. You okay? I'm fine. - Can you stand? - Yeah. Fall back. We're resuming. A match is fun. Yes, Captain. It hurts, but it's fun. Yes, Captain. This looks professional. I focused hard on it. As a manager, you're always watching over your team, and this shows. Thank you. I'm the one who should thank you. "With Nanao in our team, we did a five-on-five, boys vs girls!" "We lost, but we're still hoping to play with a full team of seven someday!" High five. Excuse me. E...excuse me. I'm sorry. I got you, stalker! I won't let you go! What happened? This stalker was trying to watch you get dressed. Hayashida! Why're you here? Stop struggling. Is that you, Jiro? Help me, sis! Sis? Jiro's notebook Jiro's notebook Stalker, huh? He looked strange with the mask and he was writing stuff. Why were you there anyways? I'm helping my sister. I'm so jealous! Switch with me. Then Hayashida, why were you there? Well... Um... For real! For real! - For real! - Excuse me... Are you guys Handball Strive? You know us? Seriously? That's crazy! I read about you on forums. Nanao's great, isn't she? I don't like the nickname. Where's the boy on TikTok? Who's that? #HandballStrive! Appreciate! It's the best! He's evolving. #HandballStrive! Appreciate! It's the best! #HandballStrive's the best! Dang. Get him! Go around! Hold it! So, when did you join our handball team? I didn't really join... Should we reveal your lie? Let's do it. You're gonna get so much hate. Please forgive me. Your sense of rhythm is perfect for handball. We'll forgive you if you join us. Can you use Handball Strive's account to follow me back? Okay, that's a deal. Seriously? Awesome. Hold still guys. One, two, three... Seven members. So what? We have enough members for an actual game. That's with Hayashida and Jiro? No way, I can't do that... I'm not athletic. Your knowledge is enough to help us. Yeah, for real. I haven't accepted you. Now everyone, let's run into the sunset. Boys' handball team! Hey yeah! Handball Strive! Hey yeah hey! C'mon, run! "Kurahisa, Jiro, and Hayashida joined! We have enough members! #HandballStrive" You look prettier since you started yoga. Did I lose weight? That makes me happy. What is that? I got this as a gift. I can see photos of my grandson with it. Isn't this right outside? You're right. What're they doing? All right, one more! Five, four, three, two... Yell! No good. One more! One more! All right! More petals in the front. Focus on the moment! Here we go. Now yell! Kurahisa! Your legs! I'm sorry! One more. Petals! Okay, one more time. Focus! Here we go! Make your face! Grandpa, you're in the picture! Don't be stingy. Put me in. Boys' Handball #HandballStrive Initially, I was impressed by Handball Strive. Good balance of photos and comments. Short words that leave room for the reader's imagination. We're facing a problem. Even if everything goes smoothly, there's no surprise. Then, what... Let me make an announcement. You can see panties from here! You joined for this Katayama? No, I'm just sunbathing. It's time to learn about the world, Jiro! Stand firm and strong Jiro! Be a man! Nice work. What're they doing? They've been like that for two hours. Jiro's having fun. Are they quitting soon? I don't think so. Hey, you two. Nanao. Can I go home with you guys? So good... I normally stay away from sweets. That face she made... it's too cute. Oh yeah, I wanted to thank you both. You know how Jiro's awkward? Even at home, he's like that. Apparently, he used to get bullied. But, he never told me. I know how he feels. I was bullied in middle school. But... Masao and Taichi helped me. But, we're just losers. I'm jealous of Jiro. It's nice to have a sister like Nanao. Sorry, I just love my little brother. Excuse me... Are you Nanao? Yes... How do you know me? Are you the flying Little Orihime? I guess I am. That's crazy! Can I get a picture with you? - Sure. - Really? Handball Strive is awesome. You're too excited. Take us. TV stations are asking for interviews? Yes, we received many donation offers from local businesses and graduates. Some are from outside of Kumamoto. We're being seen as a relief project. This is a first for us. I know that our girls' handball team is well recognized, but not the boys. It's all because of Handball Strive. What is that? It's a social media account. Stone cold maniac? "Social media." Today we bring you to Kokubu High School! Hosts Pu & Mu Everyone's excited! I saw my ex and out came a pistachio from my butt. Next came out a shish kebab. What? Japan is excited for the Olympics, but Kumamoto isn't losing. Let us introduce you to the young stars on social media. This is student variety! It's time for... Amazing Youths! Hey mom! Are you watching this? He's on screen! Where's Masao? Sponsored by Okamoto Construction Say hello to the boys' handball team. Hello guys! Hello. I'm the adviser. - Back up. - Go shave. They're now famous on social media. What made you start this? Captain? Hello? We wanted to help with the relief project... Without showing off, we just do... Wow, look at you! You're like a celebrity. You look slender and handsome. 29.000 Followers They're like stars. 29.000 Followers For the locals that support us, and of course, for my followers, I strive! Yes, the name is #HandballStrive. And my TikTok account is... All right, you're talking way too much. "My hashtag is..." "My hashtag is..." You love it! - Thank you. - Can we get a handshake? Thank you so much. You're so cool! Handball Strive. Kurosawa. Did you watch the... No. I recorded it. You want it? It's online, too. Seriously? That's too fast. You're fine with this? Fine with what? Entering the tournament. Barefoot Sandal didn't seem happy. Then, go practice. Well... We're not like that. Working hard and acting tough are important to achieve victory. With us, we're not good enough for that. Not even to try. Hey there. You're boring. You were better back when you were with Taichi. Taichi has nothing to do with all this. Don't get in our way. Nationals are coming up. But we're helping you out, too. Look, Handball Strive's follower count is... What's that for? Social media? Followers? So what? They're just numbers. What's the point in all that? She's nervous about the nationals. That was scary. How's it going? Yeah, we're Handball Strive! Did you see us on TV? We got permission to use the gym? Uh-huh. So we can give it our all for the national qualifiers. That's the power of making it on TV! It's weird. Usually netizens only complain about people on TV. They just wanna see us struggle and fail. Dude! That Tokyo accent is so annoying! Well, I'm a city boy. So what? Where in Tokyo? Shibuya, Shinjuku, or Roppongi? Those are all downtown. I'm from Hachioji. Where's Hachioji? What district? Hachioji is a city. There's no such city, faker! Hey! You want a piece of me? Let me explain our training plan. You don't need to, Jiro. What? There's no more point in practicing. Hey, what about the gym? The girls need it more. It's fine, we won't bother them. Yes. Besides, my sister... What?! What did Nanao say?! She said that practice is important. We're going to have TV coverage until nationals, too. Don't you want to show the world our dream after Kumamoto's restoration? Our dream? Don't worry. You can leave all TV scenes to me. That's enough, Kurahisa. There are too many comments. I turned off notifications. "Good luck with what?" The next match, right? Ah, I see. "Good luck", huh? Here we go. We'll be able to play matches again soon. Right, we have to wait for now. Then...I quit. Masao... Why put in the effort if we can't play in matches? I won't quit. I want to play. Strive...do your best... It's so lame. Today, we're going to watch Handball Strive's match! Our last interview with them went viral! I'm so pumped! Now, let's go interview them! Let's do it! Are they the ones? Hello! Wow! Pu & Mu! Show us your pose! I found them! - Hello! - Hello. How are you feeling? Um... I'm so happy I can connect to Wi-Fi here. - Wi-Fi? - Yes, I... No, no, no. This is my first match in three... or four years. Hey! That must be the captain! - Hey! Captain! - Go! Go! How are you feeling? Um... hey, yeah, hey! Our opponent is a powerhouse team. However, we have... you, beloved followers. So we won't let them down! Thank you! Perfectly prepared! It's finally started. Do your best! Handball Strive! Yeah! Go for it! Defend! Defend! Block it! So close! Keep going! Go! Go! Handball Strive! Get up! Oh, crap! "Kikuyo vs. Kokubu" "Kikuyo vs. Kokubu" What was that?! What the heck?! S-sorry! - Get back! - Hurry up! Don't slack off! Get up now! Masao! Kikuyo vs. Kokubu What a shame. Yes. How disappointing. You did your best! Captain, captain! You did your best, right? Good job. It was so touching. I'll always root for you. Of course! Look, look! Hooray! Hooray! "Disappointing," he says. It was pretty fun, though. I had a great time. I don't believe that. It was 73-5. We lost by 58 points. 68 points. Same difference! You don't deserve to cry! Hey, stop. All right. Let's go take pics. Right now?! At this moment?! We're Handball Strive, aren't we? White sky and green earth We're different like the rainbow We're just small travelers The far distant future Is beautiful and bright with you You're doing good! Get more upset! You're doing good! Get more upset! The broad road continues The broad road continues The rainbow flowers bloom The rainbow flowers bloom More! The rainbow flowers bloom The rainbow flowers bloom More! The rainbow flowers bloom The rainbow flowers bloom And more! The rainbow flowers bloom Can't you just act upset?! Your face was perfect just now. You looked upset. Let's post this too. Then, people's cheers will become even bigger. "Reach. Connect. Just like we used to." This way? "Reach. Connect. Just like we used to." No. This'll be better. How about here? There've been many young people out front. I noticed that too. They're taking pictures. They came here just to take pictures? I heard people call this area a mecca. Because of the students, I hope handball becomes more and more popular globally. I'm rooting for #HandballStrive! It's become such a big deal. Yeah. They're famous now! It feels good to cheer someone on. Yes, instead of being the ones cheered on. We hit 50.000 followers even after we got crushed. I didn't expect to see good news. Winning doesn't necessarily matter. Yup. Our opponent is getting flamed somehow, though. "You don't deserve to win!" "Quit handball! Boring." "Quit handball! Boring." The result should've been expected by everyone. I kinda feel bad for them. That just wasn't what people wanted to see. On the other hand, look at our account! There's a next time, We're by your side, Cheer up! How sweet. Hold on! We got a comment from a foreigner! - Amazing. - Super cool. We're global stars! That's crazy. Let's live stream and act like we're reviewing the match. Let's do it! Oh, here you are. We're gonna live stream right now. I don't... What was that? Niiice! Nanao tore a ligament in her left knee?! She got injured during yesterday's practice and has to stop exercising now. What about the nationals? There's no hope. Then, why is she attending the practice? She's assisting her teammates now so they don't have to worry. Left knee... You okay? I'm fine. Masao? Nice! Stay focused! Nice! One more! Pass it! To the side! Posting again? This time about Nanao's injury? I can't ignore the comments. You shouldn't write about her injury. She pushed herself too hard without telling us. Is that so? I don't want people to treat her like a heroine in a tragedy or say our team will lose at the nationals due to her injury. That's what happens on social media. All I can do is respond to their cheers. Don't you care about her feelings? What about the people cheering us on? You don't even know them. You're so selfish! You're the selfish one who's been depending on us. No, I'm not! Even if you got to use the gym more? That's enough, Masao. Okay. I'm done with this. Sorry, but we can't do anything. Why don't you two practice? Nanao wishes she could. What are you "striving" for? Wait, hold on! Even you... You get it, right? There are things you can't control. We learned that back then. It sucks. It's so frustrating. But... I don't want to give up. I don't want strangers to judge us... and declare who's responsible when we lose. That's just so... Then, just win. Without Nanao... Just don't lose. Obviously! But... You always run away from things, so I don't want to hear that from you! Masao! Good timing! Help me out. Don't you run away from things at all? I always run away from things. You don't seem like it. Bring those. We just have different standards. Running away can look like fighting to others. But Nanao is fighting. I tore a ligament before, too. I didn't want to be pitied and I became a coach. So I think she's strong by staying on the team. How is she that strong? I don't know. Man, I want a boyfriend! Nanao's training plan Nanao's training plan Boys' handball team! - Hey! Yeah! - Yeah! Hey! Handball Strive! Hey yeah hey! Do grapevines! Arm circles! Next! What made you join practice? Well... I hate to lose. I see. That would've been a good post. Boys! We finished and can help out now. Thank you! Separate like earlier! Yes! Keep your weight on your both legs. As soon as you get the ball, head to the goal. Left, right, left, then jump! - That's a fake-out? - Yes. I catch the ball, then... - Super good. - Oh, yeah? Good steps. Thanks. Move forward. Bring it on! Make sure to play your own position. Nobody greets their coach when I show up? Good, good. Let me try. Nationals in 18 days Almost time. Thanks for stopping by. Hey, don't forget the pics. Post the pics from today. Uh...okay... Bye! Good work! See you! Huh? Wha...what?! What?! Niiice! That's it? It's a video. We'll capture the moment. This app's scary good. "What is this???" "So it's all fake?" "We've been tricked!" That guy, right? Good morning. Morning. Are you okay? Boys' Handball Team #HandballStrive Practice was cancelled today. The principal and advisers are talking right now. Flaming... Give me a damn break! We were just playing with the app at first. Who cares about that? Why temporary housing, out of all places? I'm being attacked because I'm not a local. Let's calm down. Right, the match is ahead of us. How can you think about the match now? Masao. Seriously, why the hell would you do this?! Sorry. I can't take this idiot! Why don't we look at panties? You know what? You two started this crap, so... But! You took advantage of it. Why you little... Stop it! I'm really sorry! This is all my fault! That's right. Everything is your damn fault. Ah! Nanao, poor girl. Her injury is your fault, too. Hey! Stop! You lose the ball too easily! That's because you rush! Everyone did great. Why're you saying that right now? We all could've communicated better. Don't act so calm. You guys are just freakin' liars! Hey! Where are you going? Our time is over. Hey! Looks like you got roasted. People are so brutal. All the donations were cancelled and the TV coverage suddenly stopped. A total 180. I'm sorry for troubling you. People are sensitive about fakers online. They are selfish. They got excited about our restoration and our dream but now play the victim, fooled into donating to us. Even I got annoyed by that. Mr. Yoshimuta. Well, we've lost a lot. But not everything. It's like three years ago. You lost many things, right? Yes. But people are stronger than you think. Some things always stay the same. C'mon. Stop being so miserable. I'm trying to survive! Stop being so miserable. What's wrong, Masao? Mr. Yoshimuta... Is life... Is life hard? Look at the sky. A star is twinkling. Kokubu High School Boys' Handball Team Official Account #HandballStrive 91.000+ followers "Liars." "Fake disaster victims." "Inconsiderate." "Don't take advantage of the quake." "We'll push you into a corner." "We were supporting you!" "This is fraud!" "We'll never forgive you." "Apologize to us!" "We know where you live... Masao? Are you still up? Yeah. Dad was worried about you. About what? You haven't eaten much and didn't even look at your phone today. Did something happen? Flaming. What is it? What is on fire? Anything and everything. I don't fully understand, but I know you've been working hard on your phone. You've never stuck with anything for long. You quit both swimming and radio exercise, but... Mom. Is that a compliment? Mom... Good night. Good night. #HandballStrive Cheering Squad Is he your son? He's the funeral director. That was sudden. He caught pneumonia. It must be so bad. I heard his daughter was out of town. He was smiling yesterday... and excited to see you playing dodgeball. Hello! How are you? - Oh, Teruteru. - It's been a while. Wow, that tie looks great on you! Super stylish! - Really? - For sure. But it looks a bit off, so I'll fix it. There, fixed! You made me blush. You're so cute! Taichi! I used to love this place! "A million yen hag." I remember that. The temporary housing emptied out in only three years. When I wake up, I think, "Why am I here?" Every morning. Then I posted those old pics. In Toyama... People say I abandoned this town. So, what can I do? Just keep playing. I was happy to see you guys playing handball still. "Speak up! Make yourself known!" Don't ignore my comment if you saw it. I just didn't know how to respond. You made me sad. Ah, now I remember. The peace sign guy. Peace sign? He always made a peace sign whenever we saw him on our way to school. Oh, did he? Thank you so much! Is that Taichi?! I was right! You got even taller! Oh, yeah? Been a while. It doesn't feel like it, though. Why are you here? I'm visiting my dad's grave. I'll stay the night here. I see. Oh, so you started handball too, huh? Yeah. I'm bad, though. I figured. What do you mean?! That kid reminds me of a young Masao. Things are out of control... Then let's change it together. Hey! Speak up! Make yourself known! Oh, that takes me back! Good! That was awesome! Who's next?! It's starting! Me, me! Taichi, too! What? Why me?! Let's sing it together! Let's sing, Taichi! Clap your hands, guys! Until I see you again Until I can see you We don't need a reason to say goodbye Well... Taichi's been through a lot too, huh? When Teruteru started working at a hostess bar after the quake, I misunderstood and felt like she needed my support. But I was wrong. She does it for fun. Does she really? I mean, I still end up using my whole paycheck on her, so I am supporting her. Ah, but... That's not true. She's the one supporting me. I'm sorry I told you that you were inconsiderate. You did? I forgot. Oh, hey! Did you see the video? I know I got flamed. I'm not talking about yours. Look. "A foreigner is going nuts at the grocery store" "A foreigner is going nuts at the grocery store" Whoa. He's going crazy. "Grocery store terrorist sighting!" "Grocery store terrorist sighting!" Record it as much as you want! "Grocery store terrorist sighting!" Are you recording it? He threw something. Is this inconsiderate? Should we call the cops? Then why don't you come get me? Then why don't you come get me? "Hurry to Kumamoto plz" You're the one having fun with the disaster! Huh?! We're living every day here! We're living every day here! "Living every day LOL" And we'll continue living here! "Living every day LOL" Thanks to him, everyone's attention is on this now. That's terrible. If people really strive for something, they don't see it as a struggle. You don't need to strive to thank someone, right? Yeah... I think. I found you brothers! Come join us! - I don't... - Try to have fun! Move forward in your life. Well said, Teruteru! I'm smart! Go up to the stage! Are you having fun?! His peace sign. Right? Sing! Sing! Sing! We brothers are gonna sing together! Listen, old man! I will never forget that you interrupted my first date! If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands If you're happy and you know it, pat your shoulders If you're happy and you know it, pat your shoulders If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it If you're happy and you know it, pat your shoulders Nice! Old man! Are you listening to me?! Are you listening? Go on, get up! He's smiling! You should say something to him! Be healthy. Masao, seriously? Is that it? If you're happy and you know it, make a peace sign If you're happy and you know it, make a peace sign If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it If you're happy and you know it, make a peace sign Go Kumamoto! Go handball! "Traitors" What? I... I want to join the match with seven of us. It hurts when I get hit in the game. But I feel nothing when I'm flamed. But you're more yourself when playing handball. What is "myself"? Who decided that? I'm not from Kumamoto anyway. I wasn't here when the quake occurred and I don't live in temporary housing. It doesn't matter! Instead of uncontrollable things, focus on what we can change! Is this a teen drama? I hate being on a team. You're kidding! A lie again? - I know, right? - Don't get us involved. I'm not saying I like you. But when I passed you the ball and you scored... wasn't it fun? How pathetic. Let's go over there, Hayashida. Yeah, let's get out. - Thinks he's all cool. - Jeez. Don't be cocky. Stupid. We're off. Good work. Oh, you scared me. Sorry... I forgot something here. You're supposed to go home. Hard training, isn't it? Actually, it helps me stop overthinking things. You can forget all the negativity, right? You can't ignore things if you can't practice, though. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? Because your injury is my fault. No, no. I got injured a while ago but I just kept practicing. Dammit! Thank you. "Reach. Connect. Just like we used to!" That phrase... Just felt like saying that. To be honest... those posts reminded me of how much I like handball. I'd been feeling so much pressure to win before that. People cheering me on felt like a burden. You didn't seem to feel that way. People are selfish. People say whatever they like online. "The flying Little Orihime." Doesn't make sense, right? Oh, I see. You're a "brother and matcha lover?" Right, I just can't help it. Hey. It's snowing. Really? Look. Isn't it just yellow dust from China? Yeah, maybe. It snows even in spring here. Oh! Masao! We've been waiting for you! We'll shift our defensive playing style to offensive with Captain at center. I'm the goalkeeper? You seem less afraid of being hit by the ball than anyone else. I mean, bullies used to throw balls at me. You two are late. I just wanted to see girls' panties! We're making our strategy right now. Just come in. So, if Captain plays center, where's my position? I'll stick to left back, okay? What? That's my position. I've always played left back. I can do fly goals! Nobody wants your fly goals. You just want the same position as Nanao. Psyche! Shoot, man! That was your idea! Aaarrrgggghhhh! What's wrong? I thought our team was gonna fall apart. Stop crying. Toughen up! Thank God! I'm so glad... Guys! Can you help us practice? For nationals. "Handball Strive", right? Yes! Hey, about Hirota's apartment... Let's cancel it. I'm counting on you because she's hard to deal with. What's for dinner? Oh, hey. Are you listening? Let's plan a vacation to a hot spring. - The two of us? - Uh-huh. I'm down. Dad and I will come watch you later. Okay. See you then. Good luck! I'm gonna have a blast! Ow! That hurt. Masao. You'll do great! Thanks. It's started already?! No! We made it on time! Where are they? There they are! Look! Over there! We're coming! Reach. Connect. Just like we used to. I'm glad we could make it! All right. Our opponent is a perennial finalist. According to my analysis, the key is... Jiro. Forget about strategies. Kumamoto accent? Shut up. You're right. Let's have fun. All right, let's do this! Yes, sir! Captain. Give us a chant! You too, Mr. Yoshimuta. Are you sure? Come on in. Are you ready? Boys' handball team! - Hey, yeah! - Yeah, hey! - Hashtag? - Handball Strive! Go fight win! Hey, yeaaahhh! Niiice! Okay, let's go. Let's beat them! #HandballStrive No need to be known. Handball Strive, hey yeah hey! Kokubu High School vs. Chiei Gakuin High School. Greet each other. Bow! Let's have a good game! Let's do this. Take the ball! Nice, Katayama! Great job! Captain! Good! Go again! Masao Seishiro Kato Oh my god, remember the summer Oh my god, remember the summer Okamoto Kotaro Daigo We walked on the shining asphalt road We can never go back to those days Even if I hurt so bad Even if I feel so much pain There's always something by me The dream that we used to have I will never forget it You always accept all of me Even when you look down The city covered in dust Is a different world in our eyes That swallows up our pains one by one Oh my god, I can't believe it Is this fate? Or is it an illusion? Oh my god, remember those days We could sing from our hearts Ahead of the rainbow and darkness There's something awaiting us If I could put it into words I'd want to tell you But it disappears as if it's a mirage Oh my god, if I had wings I'd cut through the dark clouds And fly up to the sky right away Riding the wind The city covered in dust Is a different world in our eyes That swallows up our pains one by one As if time stopped We're standing in a different world The world full of warm hearts Directed by Daigo Matsui English subtitles by Yuki Yamaguchi Hirono Kamo (Japan Visualmedia Translation Academy)
