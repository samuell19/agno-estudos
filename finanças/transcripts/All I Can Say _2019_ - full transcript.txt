Uh, first of all, how old are you? I'm 25. 25. Okay. Lisa! Hurry! Let me see your earrings. Mom, mom... Oh, my God, Shannon. Holy... Oh, hon, why did you have such big holes put in your ears? Am I on... is this on? Can I have a cigarette while we're in here or... If I can... if I can smoke a bowl. Hell no. Oh, shoot, Dad, do me... do me a favor. Grab that camera. Right there is the house of a judge who's tried me since I was about 13 years old. There's my senior picture over there. Where's Lisa? Where'd my girlfriend go? I also brought... some mushrooms, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, the moldy-ass... yucky-looking mushrooms. My God. Blegh. Maybe I'll just. Maybe I won't. Maybe you ought to just mind your own fucking business. Maybe that's what you ought to do. See, there's no one here so you're the only person I have to talk to. And I'm quite bored and I would love to talk. I'm preparing to go get this hand x-rayed again, for the second time. The first time I hurt it, I, uh... I hit the wall, 'cause I gacked out on it. The second time I hurt it was just the other night, keeping myself from hitting a gacked-out guitar player. Instead, I hit the wall. But the pain's still subsiding. I'm gonna go to Saint Elizabeth Hospital, where I was born. Get it x-rayed. Channel 17. Hi, I'm Tabitha Soren with MTV News. We've got a Cyber Stuff report for you now. The Beatles' 1965 classic A Hard Day's Night can now be playing on a computer near you. A Hard Day's Night is the first feature film to be released on a computer CD-ROM disc. You know, MTV needs to leave the Beatles alone. Yeah! Whoa, wow! Anyway, Mother, seeing as that your son has no money, no money... Hold on a second. This was all I could give you. I love you, Mom. It's Shannon! Shannon Hoon? It's Shannon Hoon, the singer from Blind Melon! The guy from the Guns N' Roses video! Hey, aren't you that guy from the Guns N' Roses video? Yeah! That's you, man? Yeah! Uh, one of our tapes got into a lawyer's hand and he... he called us and wanted to legally represent us and... and we... you know, we were... we were like, "You know, there's not much to legally represent here." Whoa! Nice. That's it. Um... What? So I guess you would be considered the loser at this point, Shannon? Well, considering that you fucking... Can you hear me? Do you... do you need to get a, uh, mix and all that shit? Um... Holy shit. Holy shit! ...over the decision the jury reached hours ago. There are riots all over LA. ...policemen shown in this videotape beating a black motorist are not guilty of any crime. The verdict was shocking because of the central piece of evidence: an amateur photographer's videotape of Los Angeles police beating Rodney King in March of last year. This is how we're gonna tell America that our generation is conservative, our generation is Republican... I'd like to introduce a new band that I like a lot and they've got a different style and I think you're gonna like them a lot and you're definitely gonna hear about them a lot. They're called Blind Melon. Oh, goodness. Probably one of the most original album covers I've ever seen. It's... it's Glen, our drummer's, sister. It was a family picture on the Graham family wall. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. like that. And then, when you want to stop recording, you push fader again, and you'll see "fader" come up on the screen. See it? Mm-hm. And then you push fader to fade... I... I came here with grand delusions of... of backstage groupies, and look where I am. I'm in the hotel. I've been eating chocolate chip cookies. And then I ended up hanging out with Shannon once again in a hotel room. It was... it was lame. Goodnight, Rog. Goodnight, man. Christmas '92. My dad is going... he's, uh... gotta go to jail for DUIs... tomorrow night. Are you there, Dad? And then they take your license? For how long? Well, you don't need a driver's license to drive a golf cart, do ya? Everybody feels like it's safe to go out now. So you proposed to Mom again last night? Well, both of you are too goddamn crazy to find anybody else to love ya. ...William Jefferson Clinton do solemnly swear. That I with faithfully execute the office of President of the United States.

I guess we'll have to try to write some more songs. We don't know if we can do it... Tim, in order to do those new songs, man, we need... we need a new... a... a... another cash advance from Capitol. Yeah, like... Non-recoupable. Non-recoupable $90,000 cash advance. See, I have this image... I have this image that I've... I've got everybody perceiving me as, and it's really expensive, and I've run out of money. Oh, yeah. You're going to very busy over the next couple of months. Yeah, we just... we, um... we just got the Neil Young tour. Right. We're going on tour with Neil Young and Soundgarden. And, um, that's definitely the rock and roll utopia tour for me. If we listen... What does that sound like? Why, that sounds like Neil Young playing my acoustic guitar. The value of that guitar is increasing exponentially right now. ♪ There is a town in North Ontario ♪ To get you the good news before it happens, we are at 975 units, therefore, the way sales have been, we should be platinum by sometime tomorrow. Don't! Don't be a stinker-pot. Don't! No. Put it on your face. Ooh, shh, you can't tell that. I won't tell it. Gotta protect the future. Goddamn... Mr. Jagger and Mr. Watts would like to meet the band if we're not busy. And, um... you know, they just so happened to catch us at a time when we... when we really weren't that busy. Ahh. Ahh. Yeah. It's fading in. Now, do you turn the fader off? Now, see how the STBY turns to... To record. To record, okay. Mm-hm. Now, the fader automatically goes off. Okay. Fader. Fade. Why isn't it fading out? Because you. Oh, I do have to go here? No, you... you keep... you're just pushing... One, two, three. Can you believe I did it? But when you watch this back, I don't know. Gimme the video... give it to me, Shannon. If you're gonna make fun of it... Give it to me. Put it away. Right now. Seriously. I'm serious. Ouch! Ouch? Did you hear my bones breaking? That was me, you dummy. You're not filming anything, Shannon. The light's not on. Today was the day... Today was the day, earlier this morning, where Shannon finally realized that he was the driving force behind the band and was gonna be on the cover of Rolling Stone because he deserved it. Then, after discussing it with the end of Brad's bass... Brad decided that that was no longer the case. All for one and one for all. Shannon finally decided that, uh... the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts. Today was the day that Shannon Hoon finally realized that the four of us are always right and he's always wrong. It's as simple as that. I gotta hear what these guys gotta say. Brad, don't be fucking throwing your bass at that camera there, boy! No, I just, uh... What sucks is I hit my fucking Ampeg. He did more than hit his Ampeg. I just went out and looked at his Ampeg... And who caused all this? Rolling Stone Magazine caused all this. 'Cause they just see the band as commodities and products... and marketing. They don't realize there's real human beings with real feelings involved! I'm nervous. Are you, Rogers? Let's see it. Oh, no! Shannon's got a roll! I've been doing my drinking. Kept it at the... the... the maximum. ♪ (Rolling Stone) ♪ ♪ Gonna see my picture on the cover ♪ ♪ (Stone) ♪ ♪ Gonna buy five copies for my mother ♪ 500! 500! ♪ On the cover of a Rolling Stone ♪ Are you filming him? Is that thing on? Mm-hm. I thought you said it was fucked up. Well, I'm trying to play... I feel like I'm at camp. I just got a weird flashback of being at camp. Well, I'm pissed because I'm playing some tapes back... from a long, long time ago while they're in play mode and I'm watching... watching them back through here... Yeah. There's... the screen just starts breaking up and starts... Wait, hold on a second! I'll get it! I'm gonna get it! Man, y... out of everything... Sign my hand, too! Sign my hand. My mom gave me that. Melon head 'til I'm dead. Damn. That's commitment. Hell yeah. I saw you on TV. Hola! Somos Blind Melon y aqui esta neustro video "No Rain." You know what? People like you need to get out of here. You're a fucking smart-ass. I'm fucking security coordinator. I don't give a fuck who you are, you need to fucking get out of here, you stupid fuck! You all need to stay out of this. You ain't gonna do nothing to me, man! Not... you're not gonna do one thing to me! Not one thing! Not one thing! Not one thing, you fucking... Ladies and gentlemen... Blind Melon! The year in legal violations began in January, with the arrest of Ted Nugent, who violated Cincinnati's fire code by shooting a lit arrow onstage. David Lee Roth was arrested for possession of marijuana. Shannon Hoon was caught with his pants down and charged with indecent exposure for urinating onstage during a Vancouver concert. There are more important things for people to get mad about. Doing the EP thing... in hotels... and, uh... that's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. Tuesday, 9:43 PM. End of message. Message discarded. Been a very lazy boy. I didn't tape anything in LA. Nothing around the Christmas show... with um... Porno for Pyros, Smashing Pumpkins, us, Cranberries, Kracker... Henry Rollins read 'The Night Before Christmas, ' which was the highlight of the whole evening. That's all. I can only tell you about it because I didn't videotape any of it. Sorry. ♪ ...made out of snow ♪ ♪ Frosty the Snowman ♪ ♪ Was a very ♪ Hi, look at you. You look darling! You're taking a picture for me too? All right. It's New Year's Eve. Happy New Year's, everybody. Woo-wee! Woo-wee! I think that bands, uh, like Nirvana and Pearl Jam have really... helped a lot of people deal with whatever it is that a young person deals with today. Music is a very therapeutic thing. That's what I'm attracted to. People get therapeutic value from listening to it. Some people get it from playing it. It's a fix, and it helps get a lot of things out of you. It helps you bleed. Here, Shannon. Make a wish. I have one more wish I gotta make. We got done playing over at Saint Andrew's Hall, which is right there. And we seen all these people down here on the corner. We realized there was a girl that was 20 floors up on the hotel edge up here. Police were called. They blocked this whole street off and um... she jumped. Hit the street. Why? I don't know why. Why do people imitate what they see on television? And why does the Jackson family get to hand out awards? And why do billions of people go to see Ace Ventura: Pet Detective? Why? Our first guest, we're just going to get right to 'em because they're such a hot band. This is Blind Melon! This bizarre, real-life movie continues. It's not going to hold me. On the scoreboard they're running a clock. It's up to one minute and seven seconds. Turn it into positive energy, Tanya. More on the life and work of John Candy. Several short stories and 1,000 poems. Charles Bukowski dead at 73. Not a pretty day on Wall Street. Stock prices have fallen sharply right on the heels of the bond market. It's all done. It's all done. The whole tour is done. Come on Mr. Sun, get up. Come on, Mr. Sun, pop up. Oh, oh. You're right there. You're right there on the edge of the goddamn fucking horizon. Get up. Give me another day. Give me another day. Give me another day. Give me another day. That almost made it up here! Kurt Cobain died today. Um... killed himself. I think a lot of people... including his little baby girl, probably... are hurting. Don't you think? Kurt Cobain's body was found. He is dead. A single shotgun blast to the head. Not the answer. Definitely not the answer. Your questions, 7-4-1-0-9-9-7. Your comments, hello. Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain, an extraordinarily gifted singer, songwriter and guitarist, was found dead in Seattle. It's obviously very difficult for most people to understand why someone who had had all his dreams come true could still be in such incredible pain. So I sit and I think about... What are you videotaping? I have the freedom to do that. I know, I'm just asking you a question. I'm not stopping you from videotaping. I'm just asking... I know. You can't stop me from videotaping because I am an American citizen and I have my rights. Congratulations. Why are you videotaping? Hey Shannon, this is, uh, McCready here. I'm just calling to see what's up. Um... Give it a lot of light? Okay. Okay. Ugh, gosh. Okay. So will Little Green ever grow back? I mean, I don't even care about distortion of the shape. I just want it to live. So, okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. First, he said it sounded really bad. And then, he changed his tune 'cause he said that if I can be... you know what I mean, if he bends... and he just doesn't break... like, if the limbs don't just break off, he said, then there's probably still life. Right. Wow, I wonder what happened then. I mean... My sister's talking to her about the plant. And she's lying saying she watered it when it's quite obvious that she didn't. The ordeal has zapped her energy, and the pain from the bite in her back leg is obvious. She keeps it from touching the other one. She is totally vulnerable. Well, why don't you fucking help her? In concert news, Blind Melon is bailed out of the final two-and-a-half weeks of its current European tour, apparently because singer Shannon Hoon, feeling somewhat depleted after a month-long rehab stint for alcohol and drug abuse, feels the band isn't quite up to par right now. "I don't feel its right for our fans to pay for something they might not want to see and hear," he says. Blind Melon is still scheduled to do some opening act dates with The Rolling Stones later this summer. Yeah, we cancelled our European tour. I'm just tired of playing. Yeah, we're getting along alright, but... No. Will I see a beluga at all? Huh? Will I see a beluga? A beluga? I don't know, they said there are belugas in here. Right here. Wow. There's 230 to 250,000 people here now. If there's not at least 500,000 people here by sundown, we're going to be surprised. This is a song called "Soup." Hello? New Orleans. I can't believe you're pregnant either. Huh? Alright. No, no, no. Nothing. Well, it's not too hard to figure out that Lisa is pregnant. Merry Christmas. You know, I do my best to not make a mess of things. Although people would never know that. ...which has been hit hard by Russian shelling. The Czechians are still defying the odds, battling the lates Russian onslaught. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Exhale. Inhale. Push again. Easy, easy easy easy. Oh my God. Push. Push a little harder. A little bit more. Oh my God. There she is. Oh my God. Oh my gosh. It is a she. Oh my gosh. Here, who could this be? Our first phone call. Hello? Who is this? Hi. Hi.

You're a daddy now. Say, hi. This is the face of a very tired... breast-fed baby. As you can she, she can barely hang on to her state of consciousness. Sorts of gurgling sounds, possible overflow. Mm-hm. Oh, I see. We're getting ready to release our second album, which we have entitled Soup for lack of any better ideas. How many more days left? Your red light's flashing. Why is it flashing? Is that powering down, something going out... It's hard to put up with these guys. You know what? Sometimes...
