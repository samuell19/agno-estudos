Well I've been in some b-grade movies And I have also been to jail I've been at the end of your hang man's rope And I have been strung up by nails I've been bruised and battered of body And tortured and plagued in my mind My soul has been split my heart has been broken But I always return here to find that Nothing in the world can hurt me As much as you do No, nothing in the world can hurt me as much As you do As you do As you do Well, she's a great big old world For little boys and lost girls But how I love you, yes I do, yes I do Righto tell me a story What kind of story would you like to hear, Jimmy? Not a shit one Well that is entirely subjective, isn't it? One man's To Kill A Mockingbird Is another man's twilight saga Just. Not a shit one Not a shit one, yeah not a shit one Alright Once upon a couch there were two men How these two men were acquainted with one another is not important Nor were the circumstances with which they came to be seated on the couch The curious thing about these two men The bit of the story that makes it, "not a shit one". Is that one of these men Is dying Whoa Yeah, no a shit one How did he come to learn how his impending doom I hear me assume you would like to ask Well Endless day after sleepless night, the man sat alone Letting the events of his life drift by Like apples in a flooded supermarket His mind teetering on the brink of what he instinctively understood To be some sort of great truth that could maybe Possibly, conceivably, set him free, perhaps This torturous, self indulgent, soul sifting went on for literally a couple of weeks, until On one unremarkable morning Whilst queuing up to purchase a spanakopita from his local Greek patisserie In a blinding flash of pure clarity A single thought slid unbidden into his consciousness And stared at him directly in the brain-face The meaning of life Is death Wow Yeah, not a particularly groundbreaking discovery, I'll grant you But when one considers the possibilities that unfolds themselves When one invites lady death around for a... Cup of tea and scotch finger biscuits One could be forgiven for getting a little over excited Because If human life is as finite as the irrefutably large quantity of evidence suggest it is Then lady death does indeed have us in her crosshairs From the moment of our conception In any case... When the young man in the story embraced the fact That he could tap the fuck out at any given moment He realised three things simultaneously One. Opportunities exist only when one is willing to cease them Otherwise they are just other people's experiences Two. Love is an abstract concept designed specifically to sell real estate And three. The Red Hot Chili Peppers should have stopped making music in 1991 Definitely So, there and then As Mrs cockatastias handed him a piping hot pastry package of cheese and spinach deliciousness He decided to stop living each day as if it were his last And start dying each day as if it were his first Yup, that's right folks It's gonna be one of those kinda shows Strap yourselves in! Bitches! Temptation! Temptation! You're at the post office to purchase a small porcelain doll and some bubble-wrap and an envelope You're planning to wrap the porcelain doll in the bubble wrap stick it in the envelope and send it to your nan And you realise if you just wrapped the small porcelain doll in the bubble wrap and stick it in the envelope you can go up to the counter And pay for the envelope without paying for the bubble-wrap Or without paying for the small porcelain doll Temptation! You're on a plane and a businessman across the aisle playing some sort of role playing, build a village, plant crops and zap warlocks fantasy game on his iPad And you look and he's like 45 years of age And you just want to reach across the aisle and slap him in his fat face and say "You're a grown man for Christ sake What are you doing with your life you piece of shit? Temptation! You're at a tram stop and a stranger offers you a Savoury Shapes Temptation! You're at a show at the Melbourne Fringe festival and you can't concentrate Because the guy in the show said that he bought a porcelain doll at the post office! Temptation! And you're like: "What the fuck business does a post office have selling small porcelain dolls And you've never heckled at a show before but you feel like tonight's the night 'cause you just want to heckle this prick and his stupid porcelain doll story Temptation! Yeah! This is the story of a young man stumbling his way through life like a new born elk in an oversized fedora Clumsy and slightly naive yet not entirely without his charm Now, Jimmy! The definitive leverage of a storyteller is perspective In this case you are to hear the story from the point of view of a young man As he is the character through who's eyes I've chosen to allow you to peep But this story This story could just as easily be about a young woman Retiring, yet feisty! Arrestingly beautiful, yet kinda goofy Eternally optimistic, yet drenched in sadness There's nothing sexier, than paradox personified Like having a wank in church Now, Although we'll be following this particular young man Down the particular path, that he has chosen to be particular about His story only really becomes relevant In the context of this specific theatrical concept When his path, intersects with the path of the young woman An intersection which, coincidentally enough Occurs on a couch Not too dissimilar to this one in fact, but perhaps with less forensic evidence of loneliness on it You know that, vague aroma of Take away noodles and post ejaculatory hatred You may be familiar with the scent if you've taken a shower in a brothel Or perhaps used the recently vacated computer chair of a single male friend in his mid to late 30s It's a real... Kind of smell What I'm trying to say is the couch in the story is a little bit nicer than this one What have you got against our couch? I've got nothing against our couch, Jimmy It's a good couch, I'm just saying it's a little share housy The kind of couch delicately held together by Tears, puke and bong water Annually dumped outside some shitty suburban house somewhere by a Motley pack of impoverished students who, drag it out on the nature strip and, dump it there before trudging off to the real world To get all the jobs and have all the children While the poor unsuspecting couch is left to await the terrible fury of the hard rubbish truck Only to be rescued at the 11th hour by another Motley pack of impoverished students, giggling and panting as they shove it down the street atop a couple of rickety skateboards Ohh, this is gonna be the best summer ever! While the ill fated couch in some kind of Nightmarish furniture ground hog day Years marked only by Triple J Hottest 100 listening parties, eurgh Ohh if this couch could talk, the stories it would tell It would tell the tale of the time you found yourself perched upon its pungent upholstery at the party that time in that house in Reservoir When that guy offered you that pill and then you spend the night chewing your own face off and indiscriminately attempting to finger everybody in the room That's around the time that you discovered that ecstasy was probably the greatest invention of all time And you took it every weekend for about six months Just, nrrghhgh *beat boxing* nani nani *beat boxing* uhnrraargh Until your serotonin levels were so low You found yourself weeping hysterically at 3am on as Tuesday because the local 7-eleven ran out of blue flavored slushies Been there, that's awesome Been there, whoa Blue flavored slushy man, thanks for coming in What flavour is that by the way, dude? Blue. Yeah, what the fuck is it? It's not a flavour. Not natural. I know! It occurs very rarely in nature It's not. Name me a blue food. Blueberries. They're fucking purple! We're talking 7-eleven slushy man We're talking about slushy blue, what flavour is that? Fucking highlighter! Stop eating blue. Don't eat blue shit! This is is now a community service announcement Stop it! Nobody eat the blue stuff! "Oh no, it's mint." Mint is green! If you planted mint and it came up blue You would set that shit on fire "No no, it's ice, it's cold, it's like water." Water is clear! The only time water is clear is when there's billions of tons of it and it's all in the one spot And then it's got all sorts of shit in it Like salt and sharks! Blue means sharks in it! Don't eat it, it's got sharks in it. You know when sharks kill people. Horrible, horrible way to go. But it sort of shits me when they then go out and kill the shark "Ohh, it's gone rogue" No it hasn't It's just doing what millions of years of evolution has programmed it to do Fucking swim around eating shit "Yeah, but, yeah no. It came in to our bit." "This bit's our bit" What? No, no. See that bit there That big fucking wet bit That's it's bit This bit here. All of this dry bit That you're standing on with your legs. Your legs that have evolved to stand on the fucking dry bit That's your bit You're going to it's bit, you're going to get bit that's the lesson Don't go in there and wiggle your ass around like a slutty little hors-d'oeuvres And then get blamed when you get bitten If they ever figure out how to come up on land and start breathing oxygen and start eating us up ear, fucking kill them then Don't let 'em come in to our bit, aaarghh The sharks got in to our bit, fucking... That is the noise that land-sharks make apparently They're all Swedish I just think that we should let the sharks kill one of us every few months You know, just to level the score 'Cause when we're not stealing all of their food in massive nets, and not even eating half of it Or when we're not, slicing their fins off and letting them sink to the bottom of the ocean to be raped by a necrophiliac squids We just take all our feces and just... Put it into their house Ahh "This looks like a good spot for all of our feces" "This is my house." "Yeah, no we're already doing it." "So we'll probably, probably just gonna keep doing that, champ." "Could you, could you not?" "No shut up this is where we put our feces now." "It's the feces place." If a group of people came around to my house uninvited ate all of my food, shat it out and gave me the shit back If I ever met one of those people, I would totally bite them You're the motherfucker that stole my food and smeared shit on the walls? Come here bitch! I don't know. I think we should be paying shark tax. That's my policy, it'll be like getting called out for jury duty Nuhhh, I got pulled out for shark... What was I talking about before I...? The couch. The couch! This is a good couch Jimmy! A sturdy, reliable Regrettable sex with a housemate after a bottle of absinth kind of couch And quite the opposite kind of couch on which our young man was seated When his life got interesting enough To write a story about Hit it! As the sun rose over the dewy rooftops of Melbourne Our young man was standing on a balcony on the other side of the planet Absentmindedly staring at a crescent moon and seriously regretting his decision to leave the hotel It was an after party An overcrowded invitation only affair in a pretentious loft bar With overpriced cocktails and one to many black reflective surfaces He was there as the plus one of a dear old friend who twirled off his arm the moment she entered the room And attached herself like some kind of whorish barnacle To the chiseled pectorals of an Irish acrobat After half a glass of nauseatingly sweet orange juice and some strained pleasantries Barely audible of the persistent slapping of backs He was pin-balled from shoulder to shoulder across the room until he was eventually birthed backwards out of the crowd and Jettisoned on to the couch Slick with the amniotic fluid of social awkwardness Confirming his suspicions that his absence from the room would have absolutely no effect on anyone in it He readied himself for a dash towards the stairs When all of a sudden An attractive young woman dropped out of the sky And landed next to him on the couch There was something in the way she politely acknowledged him with a barely noticeable lift of the chin that made him catch his breath It was conspiratorial As if she just dashed in from the meadows Kicked off her shoes and scampered down the hallway to breathlessly whisper into his ear in a music anecdote about a bumblebee and a package of chocolate biscuits Hello Hello Shit I am completely in love with this woman There is a theory that we look for love only to fill a perceived lack within ourselves That if we were content with who we were there would be no need to look to others to complete us Like the proverbial syringe full of botox into the upper lip of the gold coast house wife There is an opposing argument though that suggest that it is only once we are content with who we are that we may truly allow ourselves to be loved That it is not until we're emotionally mature enough To love ourselves that we may accept the love of another person and capture that crafty concept of true everlasting love The kind of love reserved exclusively for people who own pug dogs Aw look at his stupid little fucking face So it is somewhere smack bang in the middle of those two schools of thoughts that our young man is currently placed Midway between botox in the lip and the face of a pug Lessons learned from previous relationship blunders and some careful time for self reflection Have left him ultimately confident enough to consider himself a catch And yet, still plagued by enough loneliness and self doubt To fall in love with anyone who happened to sit next to him on a fucking couch He's an uncomfortable mix of confidence and paranoia Encased within a fashionable winter jacket And as he sat there He was aware of these two opposing forces within him and felt a momentary twinge of caution But, disarmed as he was by the curious beauty of the young woman seated to his immediate left Any semblance of self preservation buggered off down the shops and he decided to roll the freaking dice Having fun? Not really Yourself? I'd rather be tucking in to a plate of my own shit now you come to mention it She smiled He smiled back Like a dickhead You like squirrels? I'm not opposed to the squirrel There's a squirrel in my chimney What? There's a squirrel! In my chimney! Is that a euphemism? Ordinarily yes, but in this case it also happens to be true What's its name? Dennis. You wanna meet him? I can honestly say, I wish for nothing more in this world right now than to meet to meet Dennis the squirrel Excellent Should we phone ahead? No point Dennis has terrible phone reception inside the chimney They walked arm in arm down the cobbled street Cut through the park and took a left at the fruit shop It took them exactly 23 minutes from couch to doorstep Add to that the minute of conversation they had at the bar The four minutes it took them to clamber onto the roof And the 19 minutes they sat laughing hysterically at the wacky antics of Dennis the chimney dwelling squirrel And that makes it exactly 47 minutes from the moment they met 'till their first kiss It was a real... planet aligning, heart stopping, breath taking, poetry inspiring, face melting, first kiss As if the electricity between them was powering the lights of the rambling city spread out before them As if that city was their and theirs alone They didn't talk much after that She let him back down the slated roof Over the edge and in through her bedroom window and that's where they stayed for three days Only emerging for occasional cups of tea and blueberry croissants He knew the moment she sat on that couch he was done for He did the honorable thing though and waited until the following morning to tell her that he'd fallen in love with her They woke early on the fourth morning to the sound of rain slapping at the window The most comforting sound known to human kind when all you have to do is snuggle further down under the blanket and spoon the person you're clearly supposed to spend your life with Unfortunately for our young couple Later that day the young man had a date with an airport An airport from which he would then hurtle away at terrifying speeds at improbable altitude. Only to be deposited 26 hours later onto a vastly different bit of the earth The bit of the earth with all his stuff on it Books, records, pot plants, unpaid parking fines. Such a long, long way from the bit of the earth on which his new found love kept her own collection of paraphernalia Photographs, sketch books, scarves and hats and, little jars of beats and jewelry and trinkets and shit and little bottles of perfume a squirrel named Dennis Their parting contained the appropriate levels of bitter and sweet He kissed the tears from her cheek She slid the note into his jacket pocket As he took his seat before the train left She ran along side the window pretending to keep up like they had already gone "Ohh, wait for me." "Ohh, don't leave me like this." It was hilarious everybody thought so When the train left for real though she... She just stood there and watched it go Looking simultaneously like the luckiest and unluckiest woman on the face of the planet There's that sexy paradox again He nestled further back down into his seat and let the events of the last few days wash over him The relief was immense After years of searching he'd finally found the one Now when any of his more incepite friends asked him "Is she she one?" He could bypass his usual go to response: "Well she's a one." and go straight to: "Yes!" She is the one! I have found the one! Out of all the billions of people on the planet I found the one, the actual one He plugged up his ears and fed some suitable melancholic music directly into his cortex and read the note she'd slipped him When I send you the sun send me the moon Keep your eye on the horizon and I'll be seeing you real soon Shit! She is the one As the train rolled into the station He reached for his bag A tiny tiny little voice piped up inside his head She's not perfect though, is she? What? Well, she's fallen for your bullshit. She must be fundamentally flawed on some level. What bullshit? Ohh come on! You don't seriously think this is real, do you? You fell in love on holiday you fuck head. Don't listen to him. She's fixed you, you're fixed now. She's a proper person, you're a proper person. She's the one! You found the one! Yeah, yeah I did. Shut up! Everything is great. Is it? Well, how do you expect to maintain the level of reckless romantic abandon you've been pumping out the last 72 hours We'll make it work, she'll come visit me I'll come back here, that'll be fine Argh, come on! You can't maintain honeymoon status forever buddy. She'll see through you eventually Love is enough That's all they need Well said. Thank you, Randy. Thank you ever so much. Alright, well you two fuckheads enjoy your little fantasy And I'll be over here waiting for you to crawl back back down the path of destruction you are undoubtedly about to pave. Not this time. I'm out. I'm done. We're doing it. We're gonna do it. She's fixed me. I'm fixed It's gonna be fine. She's the one We're gonna make it work, it's gonna be awesome. Whatever. Lunch? Sure. I'm buying. You always buy. That's because I am the good one. Fuck yourself. Cut it out you two. Piss off. Yeah, you wrote this shit. What is this fucking scene anyway? I think it is some sort of angel demon concept but he's too stingy for elaborate staging. What a tight ass. Shut the fuck up! There's a lot of lonely mornings in a long distance relationship A lot of lonely mornings and a lot of trips to the post office. They wrote letters. They emailed. They used iChat. iMessage, FaceTime, Viber, WhatsApp. He even deployed a carrier pigeon to surprise her for her birthday, but ugh... It didn't make the distance. They lost contact with it, somewhere over the Arabian sea and ugh... Despite an extensive search and rescue mission under some pretty severe weather conditions the pigeon was never recovered This is the black box recording of its final transmission Such a senseless waste of an innocent sound cue Well, what the fuck is that shit, I have no idea Luckily for our young couple this story takes place during the age of the communication obsession and if you've ever faked an orgasm over Skype you'll know what I'm talking about Thanks to those crazy Estonians The Jetsons video phone became a reality in 2003 And we now have a mostly affective and reasonably inexpensive method of seeing the genitals of a loved one from a great distance Which is nice They spoke of the future They planned a shared future Bending and molding their personal schedules in the hope that one day One day they may stand under the same sun His friends said that he'd never looked happier When you know, you just know! Do you, really? After one night with someone. I reckon knowledge is based on evidence and evidence often take a little bit of time to accumulate You know what I mean? Love at first sight is really just a primal instinctive hormonal need to continue the species, surely Compatibility at first sight, sure Love at first sight is really just an overly romantic way of saying that you wanna fuck someone, yeah No? Ohh, a few romantics in tonight. He was genuinely happy, you know. Completely in love, with falling in love. Content for the first time in almost a decade He was experiencing the joy of being in a relationship Without technically actually having to be in a relationship See, the thing that most people find difficult about long distance He was starting to discover was his favourite bit Being alone Yeah Alarm bells should probably have been ringing at that point And if you a clued-up enough audience member you may get the feeling we're not hurdling towards a Hollywood ending here But! Our young man Pushed all those doubts deep down into the abyss and caught the last train to commitment town He even seriously considered proposing and he'd always been on the fence when it came to having kids but suddenly he could understand the appeal And good luck to him. I mean. Personally I don't think I am wired that way. But I get it you know. Nah, kids are cool. I just don't really think it's my thing. I don't know. I haven't had that lightning bulb: "Ohh that's what I wanna do" kind of moment Ohh I did, no. I did have a profound experience when my second niece was born, though. I was um I was in the hospital with my sister and she was like a day old My niece, not my sister And um. I was sitting in this chair And there was like a beam of sunlight coming in through the window And it was super filmic and just beautiful and serene and and something really humbling about holding life that little and new, you know And I was sitting there, and I was just Just calm you know, just sitting there, and I was just stroking her little face and I thought if I... if I just... pushed a bit harder. I would like, push her face in Like she's that fresh She's like that new and squishy, like just formed like I've got the strength, like I'm strong enough with like one hand, to just. Just cave her little her little baby face in And you're all going: "That's fucked Randy!" I didn't do it! But the fact that I thought it Maybe I'm not cut out to have kids. I don't know. And I think, I think there may be something fundamentally selfish about having children Like I understand you've gotta be pretty selfless once they're born I get that there's sacrifice involved at that end. But, making a new little human to mold into your own image, just 'cause you wanna. Benefits no one but you and your partner Certainly doesn't benefit those of us who used to enjoy going out for breakfast Ahh you are so great. No you are also great. We are great together. Aren't we just? Maybe we should make another one. Of us? Half of me and half of you. Can you imagine? Aw, parenting's hard. Well you should have thought about that before you decided to play God. You know, having a child on the off chance it turns out to be the one that cures cancer Doesn't really stand up against statistics like 22-thousand children dying everyday due to poverty. So thanks for that You and your stinky little. Fucking noisy. Sticky. Smelly little grommets Taking up valuable space Eating my share of the crops! Shark tax. Ehh? Shark tax. Shark tax? You wanna feed kids to the sharks? Jesus, man. I know I was going to a dark place, but you took it to a holy new fucking level buddy. Ohh fuck. It was a good show. He was talking about feeding babies to sharks. Ohh fuck, should we get back to the story? We probably should. We probably shall. Thanks Jimmy. The inexorable march of time wedged more and more distance between the present and their parting And to say that the young man was getting itchy feet would be an understatement His feet were itchier than a crap infested crotch at a four day folk festival The conflicting timezones, the missed calls, the sun versus the moon He just couldn't do it anymore It was time for him to whack his testis on the chopping block of faith and follow his heart across the ocean There's a new rain, slapping at this window and old dust turning into mud all my love for you is nothing but dead flower now with a new one starting to bud and here I stand, under a foreign sun and you're sleeping across this great divide your moon sailing, shining, so patiently tucking at my heart's tight If I send you the sun won't you send me the moon Then tonight I'll send you the moon for the sun and I'll be seeing you real soon real soon real soon well, this is just the gift I have to give you at least until you see me returning as the sun gives itself onto the dawn and the moon into its long night are yearning Ohh but I'd give it, it's yours forever Even though it may seem some times to high But for you might stand under a foreign sun I'm just sleeping across this great divide So I'll send you the sun and please won't you send me the moon and then tonight I'll send you the moon for the sun and I'll be seeing you real soon real soon real soon Yes tonight I'll send you the moon for the sun and you'll be seeing me real soon Is that rum? Mhm. No I'd better not You can swash-buckle for the both of us, Jimmy I'll be the world's first sober pirate Yo ho ho and a peppermint tea I don't know man, I... I cast aside the shackles of alcoholism 'Cause I was tired of drowning in the ashtrays of my dead heroes But the trouble is, once you remove the vice All that remains is the thousands of reasons you turned to the vice in the first place Then you gotta fucking deal with that shit How far is it to the other side of the world? Heaps far Should have brought some food We could chug a rod in Catch a fish Goes against my vegetarianistic tendencies But you go for it At least you're man enough to kill your own pray That anti-vegetarian argument always comes down to the same thing Mate! We are evolved to eat meat, we are supposed to eat it We have the correct teeth, for the consumption of meat You've got... Who told you that? Kernel Sanders And by the way, that argument only really stands up if you're willing to Dash out onto the Serengeti Bring down a wilder beast with your bare hand, and then Log it 20 miles back to your hut, whilst fending off bobcats you know what I mean? Otherwise, just shut the fuck up Because if it's an evolutionary argument you are after How about the fact that we have evolved past the point of needing to slaughter millions of innocent animals in horrible conditions Just because you're quite partial to the occasional quarter pounder You fat cunt Got a bite! Ohh, bash in the head! It's a dead pigeon Ohh what's this? Don't read that. Don't, don't. Surprise! While on the face of it, this pigeon is a highly amusing birthday gesture I know you'll see straight through it to the truth. That I love you with every fiber of my being We are two sides of the one coin, you and I and I'll be seeing you real soon Send my regards to Dennis My heart is yours Randy. We have to go back. What are you talking about? I know what happens next, Jimmy and I can't go through it again We gotta turn around and go back You're the guy You're the guy in the story Ohh, well the show is not called the last temptation of fucking Jimmy, is it? Take it easy. Sorry, Jim. I'm just Fuck! Maybe I should just euthanize myself right now and pay the shark tax Don't you soft cock your way out of this one buddy She needs to know the truth. Why? Because you're not happy. He'll be happier in the long run if he stays with her He's been playing Mr. perfect since they met He can't keep it up You made him want this shit so bad He started believing his own hype People change. Not all the way through Not where it counts. She'll accept him, no matter what. Bullshit. Shut the fuck up! I didn't say anything. You're talking about me like I've deep dark secret, like I've killed a guy for his shoes or... Auditioned for Australia's Got Talent I'm not a fucking monster, I'm just a bit darker on the inside Everybody's a bit darker on the inside, you idiot Some people are just mature enough to be honest about it He's got you there buddy. Well, fuck! She'll be better off without you. That's not for him to decide Well technically it is. Look! You both know me as well as I do, do either of you honestly think That I have the ability to stop and be content with any one constant in my life Honestly! Jimmy Heads or tails buddy? Heads. Tails I've gotta go tell her The improbability, that you'd bump into me Beckons belief in the first place And the perfect unlikelihood That we could fit this good Makes me suspicious at best But ohh Love is enough Love is enough And it thrills me to say it Ohh, love is enough Love is enough to get by There's a constant temptation The self preservation But I prefer reckless abandon But at least by the end of this We'll have experienced Something only for us But ohh Love's just enough Love's just enough and I hope it can conquer Ohh Love's just enough Love's just enough to get by Well you've seen every side of me Except the side of me That you don't see when you see me And it's quite a big side of me Deep down inside of me That I've been hiding from you And I'm petrified if you see that shit side of me You might less what you're seeing So I'll change your mind for you Give back this time to you Breaking our hearts as I leave But ohh Love's not enough Love's not enough, though I hate to admit it Ohh Love's not enough Love's not enough to get by Ohh no Love's not enough Love's not enough and it kills me to say it Ohh Love's not enough Love's not enough to get by You know when you miss someone And everywhere you go, you're reminded of that person It's like they've imprinted them self on everything and anything And no matter what you do or where you go or what you look at, it all comes flooding back Can you fucking imagine, being Gotye's ex-girlfriend? Everywhere you go for like 5 years, "But you didn't have to cut me off" Motherfucker! I walked away dripping with the horrible reality of the decision I've made And the irreparable repercussions of my actions People change their minds, apparently Shit house As I zombie shuffled my way down the cobbled street A young couple skipped past me holding hands And giggling, and I remembered that feeling of falling in love That first day where everything made sense and we were oblivious to anything other than us I took a left at the cafe where we had breakfast on the third morning And I remembered that feeling of absolute certainty That this was it. Like, this was the thing to fix all the other things I cut through the park and I looked up above the tree line And I saw the balcony, the balcony of the bar, the bar with the couch in it, That couch on which our two paths happened to intersect At that exact precise moment in time against all odds I wasn't paying attention to where I was going And I tripped and I fell and there was a broken branch sticking out And it kind of pierced me through the chest and sort of, Shattered my heart into a million tiny pieces and I remembered what it felt like when I Changed my mind It can be the silliest little things that bring it all flooding back, can't it? When you know, you just know 7 billion people in the world, and I found the one She was totally the one by the way, I still have no doubt And in case any of you are wondering if there's another one now Or if it all worked out for me in the end, not really I had it and I gave it up. End of story It might not be a particularly satisfying conclusion, but at least it's honest So you reach that point You reach that point when you realize that Television and masturbation are the mortal enemies of productivity And the temptation is to stop and be content, but you can't do it You can't stop Death begins at birth, the only constant is change Tap water gives you testicular cancer The only stability you've found is in perpetual motion So you find yourself at 33 years of age Shoving a shitty couch up the street On top a pair of rickety skate boards and Paying criminally cheap rent to share a house With a manic pirate, folk singing convict named Jimmy And you trust And you trust that everyone's gonna be okay You trust that we're all gonna be just fine Resist temptation You can clap now Jimmy Stuart, ladies and gentlemen!
