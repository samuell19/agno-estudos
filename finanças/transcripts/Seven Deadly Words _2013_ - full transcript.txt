[MUSIC] - EVAN BENNETT? - YES. - WELCOME TO CONNERSVILLE. GLAD TO SEE YOU COULD MAKE IT, PASTOR. I'M VINCENT HAMAN, CHURCH DEACON. HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? - GREAT, CALL ME EVAN. - YOU REMEMBER BRAX MC COY, OUR TREASURER? HE WAS ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE THAT VISITED YOU A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. - GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRAX. WHAT'S WITH THE CAMERAS? - MILES AND ASHLEY ARE STUDENT FILM MAKERS FROM UP AT THE COLLEGE. DOCUMENTARY PROJECT ABOUT OUR LITTLE CHURCH. SUPPOSED TO IGNORE THEM MOST OF THE TIME. - OKAY, HI. - IT'S A SHAME YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN COULDN'T COME THIS VISIT. - YEAH, THE KIDS ARE FINISHING UP SCHOOL, SO... - EVERYTHING'S SET FOR SUNDAY. WE'LL HAVE A BUSINESS MEETING AND VOTE RIGHT AFTER SERVICE. IT'S JUST FORMALITY, MIND YOU. - I'M SURE OUR PEOPLE WILL FIND GREAT POTENTIAL IN YOU AS OUR PASTOR. - MAYBE HELP US GET US OUT OF OUR FIX. - YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SCHEDULE A WELCOME PARTY FOR WHEN YOU GET MOVED IN. - THE CHURCH MEMBERSHIP SHOULD REALLY ENJOY THAT. - COOL, BUT HEY, YOU OUGHT TO INVITE SOME FOLKS FROM THE AREA, LIKE TOWN OFFICIALS TO THE PARTY. MIGHT HELP GET THINGS STARTED BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE COMMUNITY AGAIN. - I DON'T KNOW. - WHY NOT? - RECEPTION ISN'T USUALLY FOR OUTSIDERS. - SO? - IT'S JUST... WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY BEFORE. [MUSIC] - RADIO ANNOUNCER: HERE'S THE OFFICIAL W. I. F. E. FORECAST FOR CONNERSVILLE. W. I. F. E. OFFICIAL NEWS TIME, 4:35. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING, PERFECT WEALTH IS 6 MONTHS FROM WHERE YOU'RE AT. WELL, TODAY'S GONNA BE THE DAY YOU WISHED FOR LAST JANUARY. THAT'S RIGHT, TOPPING UP TO 82 DEGREES BEATING THE AVERAGE A FULL 7 DEGREES. WE'LL HAVE OUR OUR SNACK... - YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A FEW PROBLEMS THAT KIND OF NEED SOME TENDER LOVING CARE, BUT WE'VE DEALT WITH IT THE BEST WAY WE CAN. - YOU EVER BEEN TO HAWAII, BRAX? - (LAUGHS) NO, MY WIFE JUST LIKES TO SEE ME WEAR FLOWERS. SHE SAYS IT MAKES ME LOOK PRETTY. - IT BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES. - SO IT'S WORKING? - AND THIS IS PRETTY MUCH... - WHAT IN THE WORLD? I DON'T REMEMBER THIS FROM MY INITIAL VISIT. - OH, WELL, IT HADN'T RAINED MUCH BACK THEN. IT'S SOMETHING OUR FACILITY HAS EXPERIENCED THAT I LIKE TO POLITELY CALL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. - EVAN? - YES? - THEY NEED US IN THE FELLOWSHIP HALL. - OKAY, THANK YOU, DEAR. I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE. - WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE GRAND TOUR. - CAN'T KEEP THE MRS. WAITING. - TELL ME ALL ABOUT THAT. [GOSPEL MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND] - MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? NOW, YOU KNOW I'M NOT ONE FOR LONG SPEECHES. [LAUGHTER] FELLOW CHURCH MEMBERS AND FRIENDS FROM THE COMMUNITY, IT IS GREAT TO SEE SO MANY OF YOU OUT TODAY AS WE WELCOME OUR NEW PASTOR, EVAN BENNETT AND HIS FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] - THE KIDS ARE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, OH, THERE THEY ARE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE A YOUNG FAMILY IN MINISTRY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, MY DAUGHTER IS IN MINISTRY NOW, TOO. AND WE ALSO WANT TO THANK OFFICER KOOGAN FOR STOPPING BY. I GUESS THE MAYOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, BUT HE HAD AN EMERGENCY, BUT HE DOES SEND HIS REGARDS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WITH THE SUDDEN PASSING OF CORNWALLACE, A DEEP SORROW FLOODED OUR CHURCH, BUT OUR MOURNING HAS TURNED TO DANCING AND OUR SORROW INTO JOY, HALLELUJAH. THE LORD HAS PROVIDED US A NEW LEADER FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. PASTOR EVAN, WILL YOU SAY A FEW WORDS? - SURE. - NO SERMONS, PASTOR. [LAUGHTER] - SEE YOU NEXT SUNDAY, THAT ONE. FIRST, THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT HERE. MY WIFE ELENA AND I ARE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE, AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO DO WHAT I CAN, BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. I'M GOING TO NEED ALL OF YOU TO HELP. AND WITH GOD'S HELP, THERE WILL BE EVEN BRIGHTER DAYS AHEAD. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I WILL BE MEETING WITH THE CHURCH BOARD, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING OVER EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO REALLY SERVING THIS COMMUNITY AND RESTORING OUR FACILITY. SO ENJOY, IT'S A PARTY. THAT LOOKS LIKE SOME DELICIOUS FOOD. WE'RE GOING TO GO GET SOME, AND EVERYONE HAVE SOME FUN, THANK YOU AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] - SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? - COFFEE? - TEA, ACTUALLY, WITH MILK AND HONEY IF YOU HAVE IT? - HEY, AREN'T YOU THE NEW PASTOR? - YEP. - HOW ABOUT YOU, WALT? - THE USUAL, I GUESS. - YOUR NOTE SAID TO MEET YOU HERE AT 8. WHY? - I NEEDED A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU. I USED TO GO TO THAT CHURCH YOU'RE AT. STILL HAVE FAMILY THERE. I JUST HAD TO LEAVE, TWO YEARS AGO NOW. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN HAD TO LEAVE? - I WASN'T FORCED OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. - I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A FEW LIVELY BUSINESS MEETINGS UNDER CORNWALLACE, GOD REST HIS SOUL. BUT EVERY CHURCH NOW AND AGAIN... - NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. CORNWALLACE WANTED TO DO THINGS. THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. - WHO'S THEY? - COMFORT IS A STRANGE MASTER. PEOPLE WILL DO A LOT TO KEEP IT. IT'S AMAZING HOW QUICKLY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS ELEVATED TO MORAL RIGHTEOUSNESS. - NOT QUITE FOLLOWING. - THEY'RE STILL THERE, YOU KNOW? THEY'LL BE WATCHING. - IT'S BEEN A WEEK NOW. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE MEANT? - I DON'T KNOW. - WELL, WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO WATCH OUT FOR? - I DON'T KNOW. - WAS THE GUY JUST WEIRD OR SOMETHING? - I DON'T KNOW. - IF YOU SAY I DON'T KNOW ONE MORE TIME, I WILL MAKE YOU UNPACK THIS BOX, I WEAR. YOU'RE LIKE... - BUT I CAN NEVER DO IT AS GOOD AS YOU. I'D JUST DO IT ALL WRONG. - YOU'RE SO CUTE AND FUNNY, AREN'T YOU? - OH, GROSS, MOM! TREVOR KEEPS MOVING MY STUFF. - TREVOR, GET IN HERE. CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE NOT FIGHT TODAY? WE HAVE WAY, WAY TOO MUCH... - WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH TO DO TO UNPACK. - I'VE HAD TO UP TO HEAR WITH ALL OF THIS PETTY BICKERING. - FINE. - THESE MOVES ARE HARD ON THE WHOLE FAMILY. WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - CAN YOU GO GET READY FOR CHURCH NOW PLEASE? - ALL RIGHT. - IS THIS OKAY? I GUESS WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES. I KNOW THINGS NEED TO BE FIXED UP AROUND HERE. IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP TELLING HIM FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, DON'T GO TOO FAST. YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE WAVES WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE. [BICYCLE BELL] - STAY. [SINGING ROCK OF AGES] - THANK YOU, THAT WAS LOVELY. HAVE A SEAT. CHRIST SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME AROUND THE SEA OF GALILEE, A BODY OF WATER TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM FED BY MOUNTAIN RUN OFF. GREAT FISHING. THE JORDAN RIVER FLOWS SOUTH FROM THE SEA OF GALILEE UNTIL IT EMPTIES INTO THE DEAD SEA. NOT SO GOOD FISHING. THEY CALL IT DEAD FOR ONE REASON. ALL THE MINERALS BROUGHT DOWNSTREAM GET TRAPPED AND DON'T COME OUT. THEY BUILD UP, AND ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE COMFORTING FOR A GOOD SOAK, NO FISH OR PLANTS CAN LIVE THERE. WITHOUT SOME SOURCE OF OUTPUT FOR ALL THE INPUT, ALL OF THAT STUFF GETS BOTTLED UP INSIDE AND CHOKES OUT LIFE. NOW, A CHURCH BODY CONTAINED WITHIN ITS FOUR WALLS MUST SEE THAT LIVING WATER FLOW INTO THE COMMUNITY, POURING FORTH THE WELLSPRING OF HOPE AND PEACE. WE CAN'T JUST PAY FOR MINISTRY. WE MUST DO MINISTRY. THAT IS OUR PURPOSE IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD. - FANTASTIC SERMON, PASTOR. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - GOD BLESS YOU. - THANK YOU, YOU TOO. - SO, ARE YOU PLANNING ON JOINING US FOR OUR WEEKLY VISIT TO THE NURSING HOMES? - YOU DO KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO, DON'T YOU? I MEAN EVERY PASTOR'S WIFE WE'VE EVER HAD KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO. - MRS. CORNWALLACE ALWAYS PLAYED THE PIANO FOR US ON OUR VISITS. - I CAN'T PLAY THE PIANO, THAT IS. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HELP. I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THIS WEEK... OH, I HAVE TO TAKE THE KIDS TO THAT COMMUNITY MUSIC FESTIVAL, BUT PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN THE NEXT ONE IS. I WOULD LOVE TO VOLUNTEER IN SOME WAY. - SURE, DEAR. - THANK YOU, LADIES. YOU HAVE A LOVELY REST OF THE DAY. - THAT WAS SO WEIRD. - WELL, THE BUDGET IS WHAT IT IS, AND THE BILLS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. VERITABLE CRISIS AWAITING A RESOLUTION. - WE STILL HAVE TO FACTOR IN ALL THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THIS BUILDING. I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN PAY TO GET IT BACK INTO SHAPE. - FOLKS MAY NOT TAKE TOO KINDLY TO WHAT'S REQUIRED. - OKAY, CATCH ME UP. - I BELIEVE YOU HAVE REVIEWED THE BUDGET AND THE ACCOUNTING STATEMENTS. - YES, I HAVE THEM RIGHT HERE. MARCUS, WHERE'S YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW? - I DON'T KNOW, HE SAID HE'D BE HERE ABOUT NOW. - FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A SERIOUS CASH FLOW PROBLEM. FINANCIALLY SPEAKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN DO OUR JOB HERE MINISTERING TO EGYPT VALLEY LET ALONE CATCHING UP WITH THE NEEDED REPAIRS AROUND HERE. - THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT. - WE AREN'T EVEN PAYING THE LIGHT BILL ON TIME. - HE'S BEEN PLAYING CATCH UP PAYING ABOUT EVERY OTHER MONTH. - YEAH, WE'VE HAD PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE HELPED US TO MEET THE NEED. - THE GANG'S ALL HERE. - WHAT LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS WERE MADE WITHOUT ME? - OKAY, I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA THAT WE ALL COME TOGETHER AS A TEAM, IT MAKES SENSE. AS YOU KNOW, THE DEACONS ARE THE SPIRITUAL LEADERS OF THIS CHURCH, AND FROM BOOKS TO BUILDINGS, THE GO-TO GUYS ARE THE TRUSTEES. - YOU MEAN TRUSTEE, NOT TRUSTEES. - WITH THE DROP IN ATTENDANCE, WE'VE LOST SOME VOLUNTEERS. WE'RE DOWN TO JUST ONE TRUSTEE. BRAX. - WE NEED TO FIX THAT. LET'S FIND SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE WILLING TO SERVE, OKAY? - DO I LOOK AT YOU OR THE CAMERA? - WHATEVER MAKES YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE. - OKAY, I'LL SHARE. BUT NO REALLY, IN THE SHORT TIME I HAVE BEEN HERE, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF REAL POSITIVES. WE'RE A SMALL CONGREGATION, BUT FOLKS SEEM EXTREMELY DEVOTED. WE'RE IN A GREAT LOCATION WITH A GROWING COMMUNITY, AND BEST OF ALL NO MORTGAGE. THAT ALWAYS MAKES THINGS A LITTLE EASIER SO WE CAN FOCUS ON THE NITTY GRITTY. - THAT'S PERFECT. - LOOKING GOOD, MILES, KEEP IT UP. - WELL, IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL WE'VE BEEN GETTING IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS, WE'VE BEEN FALLING SHORT ON THE BILLS EVERY MONTH ABOUT $1200. - OKAY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE'RE SENDING $100 EACH TO 17 DIFFERENT FOREIGN MISSIONARIES, 17! - SO? - THAT'S 17 TIMES A HUNDRED. HERE WE ARE SENDING MONEY AWAY WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN PAY OUR OWN WAY. - I'M NOT SURE... - BRAX, WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY AND PUT IT TOWARDS OUR BILLS? - NOT JUST BILLS, LOCAL MINISTRY, TOO. - CAN WE DO THAT? - BRAX, THAT MONEY IS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS. - THE BIBLE SAYS TO TAKE THE MESSAGE FROM JERUSALEM TO JUDEA TO SAMARIA, AND THEN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE WORLD. HOW CAN WE SKIP AHEAD TO THE UTTERMOST PARTS WHEN WE AIN'T EVEN GOT OUR OWN JERUSALEM IN ORDER? - I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA AT ALL, I'M TELLING YOU. AND I KNOW, I KNOW THE MISSION COMMITTEE CHAIR WON'T LIKE THE IDEA EITHER. - YOU KNOW, IF WE DON'T GET CAUGHT UP ON OUR EXTENSIONS AND REPAIRS AND OUTREACH RIGHT HERE IN EGYPT VALLEY, THE VERY FUTURE OF THIS CHURCH MAY BE IN PERIL. - I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. - OKAY, GENTLEMEN, IT'S STILL EARLY IN THE GAME. SOME OTHER IDEAS MIGHT COME UP. - GENTLEMEN, I AGREE WITH PASTOR EVAN. I THINK WE NEED TO JUST TAKE A WHILE AND CHEW ON THIS ONE. - OKAY, THEN. OUR NEXT OFFICIAL MEETING IS IN A MONTH, BUT I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET TOGETHER BEFORE THAT. HAVE A LITTLE FUN, YOU KNOW? SOCIAL. VINCENT, WILL YOU LEAD US OUT IN PRAYER? - SURE, PASTOR. LORD, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION AND ASK THAT YOU GIVE US SAFETY AND PEACE UNTIL WE GATHER TOGETHER AGAIN IN CHRIST'S NAME, AMEN. - AMEN. - VERY GOOD, GENTLEMEN. - ABOUT THAT GET TOGETHER YOU MENTIONED? - YEAH? - WELL, THERE'S A PLACE A COUPLE OF US LIKE TO GO ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT MIGHT BE NICE TO GET A GROUP OF GUYS TOGETHER. - KIND OF LIKE A MEN'S FELLOWSHIP? - YOU COULD SAY THAT. - OKAY, GIVE ME THE DETAILS. - FIRST, BRING EAR PROTECTION. - WHAT? SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. [GUNSHOTS] - OH, NICE GROUPING. - SHOW OFF. - I SEEM TO RECALL ONLY A COUPLE OF HOLES IN YOUR TARGET. - BECAUSE I'M THAT GOOD. - WHAT? - I PUT THE SECOND SHOTS THROUGH THE FIRST HOLES. - LET'S SEE, MARCUS, TOMMIE, BRAX, THEN ME. THAT JUST LEAVES YOU, PASTOR. - ELENA GOT THIS FOR ME BACK WHEN I WAS WORKING BACK IN THE CITY. NEVER QUITE HAD MUCH USE FOR IT. - A PISTOL PACKING PREACHER. - WELL, LET'S SEE IF HE'S WORTHY OF THE TITLE. [GUNSHOTS] - YOU WERE AIMING AT THE DIRT, RIGHT? - HE DOES HAVE A HOLE THROUGH THE CENTER. NO WAIT, THAT'S JUST THE FLY ON IT. [ALL LAUGHING] - HA HA HA. - NO WORRIES, PASTOR. A COUPLE OF WEEKS MORE, AND YOU'LL IMPROVE. - WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S WHAT WE KEEP SAYING ABOUT HIS SERMONS. [ALL LAUGHING] - SORRY, GUYS, I HAVE TO GET GOING. BERTHA IS EXPECTING ME FOR DINNER. - YEAH, WELL WE OUGHT TO CALL IT A DAY ANYWAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER THE WEATHER WILL HOLD UP, AND I GOT A LONG BIKE RIDE TO THE TOWN AND BIBLE STUDY TONIGHT, SO... - WHY DO YOU RIDE THAT ANTIQUE ANYWAY? YOU KNOW WHAT CARS ARE FOR. - WELL, MARCUS, I WASN'T QUITE SURE YOU GUYS HAD CARS IN THIS TOWN. - PASTOR? DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN THAT THING. - LATER, GENTS. - FIRST IMPRESSION OF PASTOR EVAN? I LIKE PASTOR EVAN WHEN I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO HIM. I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM AT THIS TIME. I THINK HE'S --HE'S ACTUALLY A LOT YOUTHFUL OR MUCH YOUTHFUL THAN CORNWALLACE, AND HE MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEAS OF HIS OWN, BUT I THINK HE MIGHT BE VERY COOPERATIVE IN OUR EGYPT VALLEY TRADITIONAL WAYS YOU KNOW? - THE PASTOR ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD EXPECTED. [MUSIC] - WE NEED A FRESH VIEW, A FRESH VISION. WE NEED GOD TO WORK THROUGH THE PASTOR. [MUSIC] - WE JUST RECENTLY STARTED ATTENDING THIS CHURCH MAYBE WHAT? THREE WEEKS. - UH-HUH, ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. - WE REALLY LIKE IT. [MUSIC] - HE REALLY CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE, AND HE CARES ABOUT THE CHURCH. [MUSIC] - I'M MEETING SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE, SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT CHANGE. MY FAMILY'S REALLY SETTLING IN. I KNOW THE KIDS ARE LIKING IT. AND ELENA AND I, WE FEEL REALLY ADJUSTED. AND LIKE I SAID, THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU GET TO MEET OUT HERE IN A SMALL TOWN, IT REALLY MAKES THIS JOB WORTH WHILE. [MUSIC] - COME ON, THAT WAS WITH MY LEFT HAND. - OH, YEAH. [MUSIC] - NICE BIKE. - THANKS. YOU GUYS PLAY HERE A LOT? - NOT MUCH ELSE TO DO AFTER SCHOOL GETS OUT. - HEY, AIN'T YOU THAT PREACHER? - YEP. - DO YOU PLAY? - ME? NO. - HAVE YOU EVER TRIED? - NO. - WELL, THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE NEVER TRIED? - YOU GOT A POINT. - YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ANY PREACHER I'VE EVER MET, AND YOU DON'T TALK LIKE ONE NEITHER? - YOU EVER BEEN? - NOPE. - HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE NEVER TRIED. - YOU'VE GOT A POINT. - [LAUGHING] MAYBE YOU SHOULD STICK TO PREACHING. - HOLD ON A SECOND, GIVE ME ANOTHER SHOT. - YOU SHOULD QUIT WHILE YOU'RE BEHIND. - REALLY, WAIT A MINUTE. LET'S MAKE THIS INTERESTING. I'LL BET YOU THAT I CAN SHOOT THE BALL FROM... HERE. - FROM THERE? - REALLY, I'LL BET YOU THAT I CAN SHOOT THE BALL FROM HERE, AND IF I DO, YOU'LL HAVE TO COME TO CHURCH SUNDAY. - ALL RIGHT, BUT WHAT DO I GET IF YOU DON'T? - IF I DON'T SHOOT IT FROM HERE, YOU GET MY BIKE. - SERIOUS? - YEP. - ALL RIGHT, IT'S A BET. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT, PREACHER. - I'LL SEE Y'ALL THIS SUNDAY? - WAIT A MINUTE, MAN, YOU LOST. YOU MISSED. - WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND. I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT. - WHAT? - THE BET WAS THAT I WAS GOING TO SHOOT IT FROM BACK THERE, WHICH I DID. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE BALL WENT IN OR NOT. - YOU DEFINITELY AIN'T LIKE NO PREACHER I'VE EVER MET. - SO I'LL SEE YOU THERE? - A BET'S A BET. [MUSIC] - WE HAVE JUST A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS MORNING. YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG IN YOUR BULLETINS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HELPED MAKE OUR VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL SUCH A BIG SUCCESS. [APPLAUSE] FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT WILL BE THIS FRIDAY 7 P. M. IN THE FELLOWSHIP HALL. POPCORN PROVIDED. VINCENT, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMETHING, RIGHT? - YES. THANK YOU, PASTOR. SINCE THE BY LAWS REQUIRE THAT ALL MEETINGS BE ANNOUNCED TWO SUNDAYS BEFOREHAND, THE QUARTERLY MEMBERS MEETING WILL BE WEDNESDAY AFTER NEXT. - SPEAKING OF MEMBERS, A LOT OF NEW FOLKS ARE COMING OUT TO CHURCH, AND THAT'S GREAT. IF ANYONE WANTS TO BE MORE INVOLVED, YOU MAY CONSIDER MEMBERSHIP. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THAT ANY TIME OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. - ONE MORE SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOR EVERYONE. - OH? - MY WIFE BERTHA WILL COME UP AND GIVE AN UPDATE. BERTHA? - I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON OUR VERY SPECIAL MISSIONARY FAMILY, THE LEIGHFIELDS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THEY ARE LOCATED ON ESPROBADA ISLAND IN THE WEST INDIES. JOHN AND BARBARA ARE RUNNING A SCHOOL THERE FOR THE LOCAL CHILDREN. THERE ARE 23 CHILDREN WHO ARE LEARNING ENGLISH, MATH, HISTORY, AND THE BIBLE. AND YOUR DONATIONS HAVE HELPED TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. - THANK YOU. - AND SPEAKING OF DONATIONS... I WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR 17 MISSIONARY FAMILIES... SORRY, 18 AFTER NEXT QUARTER. - 18? - IT WAS DECIDED AT THE COMMITTEE MEETING ON MISSIONS LAST WEEK. WE'RE ADDING THE SMITHS TO OUR SUPPORT LIST. - IS EVERYBODY SURE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO ADD ANOTHER OBLIGATION? - NOW, PASTOR, BLESS YOUR HEART, YOU KNOW WE ARE CALLED UPON TO GIVE IN FAITH. THE MORE WE GIVE, THE MORE WILL COME BACK TO US. - IT WAS BAD ENOUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER. EVEN WITH NEW FOLKS, WE'RE STILL... HOW MUCH THIS WEEK? - $500 AND SOME CHANGE. - $500 FOR GENERAL. HOW MUCH DESIGNATED FOR THE MISSIONS? - THAT SPEECH BERTHA GAVE MOST ASSUREDLY CAUSED A SMALL SPIKE. - HOW MUCH? - $643. - WE'LL BE FLAT BROKE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS IF WE DON'T ACT NOW. - WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE THE DONATIONS AROUND WITHOUT APPROVAL. I MEAN, EVEN IF IT MAKES SENSE, YOU GOTTA HAVE THE PERMISSIVE AUTHORITY OF THE CONGREGATION. - YOU PLAN A VOTE? - YEAH. - OKAY, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. YOU GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. - ARE YOU SERIOUS? - HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE MISSIONS COMMITTEE YET? - NO, IF I TAKE IT TO THEM, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO DRAG IT OUT AND PUSH IT OFF, NO. I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO THE MEMBERS WITH THIS. QUARTERLY MEETING IS COMING UP, AND NONE TOO SOON. - WELL, THIS ISN'T GOING TO FLY. - BUT IT'S LOGICAL, AND WHAT STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT? - FAMILY. - WHAT? - HE KNOWS, RIGHT? YOU KNOW THAT FAMILY BERTHA MENTIONED TODAY, THE LEIGHFIELDS? WELL, YOU KNOW WHO BARB LEIGHFIELD IS, RIGHT? - HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT? - THINK BACK. VINCENT TOLD YOU THEIR DAUGHTER WORKED IN MINISTRY. - YOUR WIFE IS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL... - NO, NO, THEIR OTHER DAUGHTER. - - MY HUSBAND VINCENT AND I HAVE TWO CHILDREN, BOTH OF THEM GIRLS. THE OLDER ONE, GLORIA. - I WAS IN AN ORPHANAGE UNTIL I WAS SIX YEARS OLD, AND MY MOTHER WAS VERY FOND OF MISSIONARIES AND HELPING OUT CHILDREN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT SHE ADOPTED ME. - AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, WE HAD BARBARA. AND BARBARA AND HER HUSBAND JOHN ARE BOTH MISSIONARIES NOW. AND WE ARE SO VERY PROUD OF THEM, SO VERY PROUD OF THEM. - SEE, WHAT YOU SEE AS A PROPOSAL TO CUT MISSIONARY FUNDING... - THEY SEE AS AN ATTACK ON THE FAMILY. - SHE'S THAT BARB? - I GUESS EVERYONE JUST FIGURED SOMEBODY TOLD YOU. - SURELY SAVING THE CHURCH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PERSONAL SACRIFICE. I MEAN... VINCENT AND BERTHA HAVE TO SEE THAT, DON'T THEY? - WOULD YOU? - I'M GET BACK TO YOU GUYS ON THIS IN A LITTLE BIT. IN THE MEANTIME, PRAY ON IT. - YOU NEED TO GET EVAN TO RETHINK THIS. - YOU KNOW THE MISSIONS COMMITTEE CAN MAKE THEIR CASE AT THE MEETING. AND IF THEY CONVINCE THE PEOPLE, WELL, THE PROPOSAL WILL DIE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, OUR HOPE MAY VERY WELL DIE WITH IT. - AND I'M TELLING YOU, THAT EVAN HAS NO IDEA WHO HE'S DEALING WITH. - MEANING? MARCUS! DEALING WITH WHOM? - LOOK WHAT IT IS, MR. RAILROAD HIMSELF. - HEY, KIM, WHAT'S IT TAKE TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE AROUND HERE? - HOLD YOUR HANDS ON, WALT. - HOW ARE THINGS DOWN AT THE STATION? - PRETTY BRISK. STUDENTS HEADED BACK TO SCHOOL. AUGUST IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT. I SEE YOU'RE STILL HOUNDED BY THE PAPARAZZI. - FUNNY. - LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS. - THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST CONVOLUTED, CONFUSING, AND GENERALLY OVERWRITTEN DOCUMENT I'VE EVER SEEN. - THE CHURCH BY LAWS. THOSE PREDATE MY TIME THERE. IN FACT, THEY MAY EVEN PREDATE THE BIRTH OF CHRIST. - YOU'D THINK THEY WERE WRITTEN BY THE GOVERNMENT. OVERLAPPING AUTHORITY. VAGUE RESPONSIBILITIES. ALMOST NO ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE MEMBERS. - YOU KNOW, I READ THE END, BUT I WON'T SPOIL IT FOR YOU. THANKS, KIM. I'LL MAKE UP FOR IT IN THE TIP. - SURE YOU WILL. - I SEEM TO RECALL THAT WE HAD MORE CHURCH JOBS AND COMMITTEES THAN WE HAD PEOPLE. - EVEN WITH ATTENDANCE ON THE RISE, IT'S STILL THE SAME. ELEVEN SEPARATE COMMITTEES. - ...OF THREE TO FIVE MEMBERS EACH? - MOST YOU HAVE TO BE A MEMBER TO SERVE ON. IF WE COULD JUST CHANGE THE STRUCTURE, MAKE IT WORK FOR A GROWING CONGREGATION. - SON, THOSE 30 YEAR OLD BYLAWS ARE WORTHY TO BE GLUED INTO THE BACK OF THE BIBLE. THEY ARE HOLY WRIT. - THEY'RE JUST BYLAWS. - NO. THEY'RE THE KEYS TO THEIR KINGDOM. CONFUSION FOSTERS CONTROL. TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM IS TO CHALLENGE THE POWERS THAT BE. - SURELY THE MEMBERSHIP HAS TO SEE THE BENEFIT TO CHANGE. - WELL, I'D RATHER SHAKE HANDS WITH A BADGER THAN TAKE ON THE HAMANS. - I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ALL THAT BAD. - MAYBE. TIME WILL TELL, MY FRIEND. AND I SEEM TO BE RUNNING OUT OF IT. GOOD MORNING AND GOOD LUCK. - THANK YOU. - YOU WANT A HEATER ON THAT, PASTOR? - SURE. THANKS. HEY KIM, YOU EVER THINK ABOUT COMING OUT SOME SUNDAY? - YOU MEAN TO CHURCH? - YEAH. - YOU KNOW I USED TO GO WHEN I WAS A KID. I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST NOT THAT INTERESTED IN CHURCH ANYMORE, I GUESS. ESPECIALLY THAT ONE. WITH ALL I'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS. - THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE THINGS, MORE RELEVANT TO REAL LIFE. - EVAN, REAL LIFE IS DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL PREGNANT, IT'S RAISING MY KID ALONE WITH A FATHER WHO KNOWS WHERE, STRUGGLING TO PAY BILLS, CHOOSING BETWEEN FOOD OR HEAT. I'M NOT SURE THOSE CHURCH PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND REAL LIFE. - KIM, YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD RIGHT NOW TRYING TO START FRESH FOR YOU AND YOUR SON, RIGHT? - WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? - PLENTY. BUT YOU'RE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN RIGHT NOW FOR BOTH OF YOU. YOU AREN'T GONNA LET YOUR PAST GET IN THE WAY. - I CAN'T. - OUR CHURCH HAS HAD A ROUGH PAST TOO. - YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. - OUR CHURCH HAS HAD A ROUGH PAST TOO. WE JUST WANT A FRESH START TOO. MAYBE WE UNDERSTAND THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU THINK. 10:00 O'CLOCK SUNDAY. DON'T LET YOUR PAST GET IN THE WAY. - SO I THOUGHT THAT WITH THE COLD WEATHER COMING UP, I CAN MAKE A COUPLE OF NEW ONES. PLUS IT HELPS ME RELAX, KIND OF A HOBBY. [KNOCK AT DOOR] - IS THAT THE DOOR? WHAT IS THAT? OH, IT'S THE BACK DOOR. HOLD ON A SECOND. OH, HI! PLEASE, COME IN. HELLO, LADIES. HOW ARE YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF TEA? I JUST MADE A FRESH BATCH. - NO THANK YOU. WE CAN ONLY STAY A MINUTE. - OH, OKAY. - WE NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL. - I KNOW, IT WAS GREAT, WASN'T IT? SO MANY KIDS CAME TO IT. EVEN KIDS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL BEFORE. - ELENA, WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. - PLEASE, WE REALLY ENJOY HELPING WITH THINGS LIKE THAT. WE DO. SO NO PROBLEM. - WELL, MAYBE JUST ONE SMALL PROBLEM. - OH, WHAT'S THAT? - WE WANTED TO SAY THIS TO YOU AS A FRIEND AND IN CHRISTIAN LOVE. - GO ON. - WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN. - HOW SO? - I WONDER IF-- HOW CAN I-- THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF FAITH TO OTHER BOYS AND GIRLS. - WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT, GLORIA? - YOUR SON PLAYS ARMY WITH THE OTHER KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, PRETEND SHOOTING AND ALL. AND YOUR DAUGHTER, WELL, WITH THOSE JEANS THAT SHE WEARS EVEN TO CHURCH EVENTS, WELL A YOUNG LADY, YOU KNOW, A PASTOR'S CHILDREN AND-- - EXAMPLES OF FAITH? LET ME ASK YOU, WHERE DOES FAITH COME FROM? FROM ACTIONS OR FROM APPEARANCES? - ACTION. BUT APPEARANCES SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT THE HEART. - I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT YOUR INFORMATION FROM GLORIA BUT TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THAT NO CHILD IS AUTOMATICALLY HOLY JUST BECAUSE SHE WEARS A SKIRT. - NO ELENA, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS. - REALLY? THEN WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CAUSE? - OH, HONEY, WE AREN'T SUGGESTING-- - AND YOUR STANDARDS, WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? IS IT FROM THE SCRIPTURES OR FROM YOUR OWN TRADITIONS? BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM THE BIBLE. HOW DO YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN, GLORIA? THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY YET. - ELENA, I JUST THOUGHT-- - YEAH, YOU JUST THOUGHT. WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, LADIES, BUT MY CHILDREN ARE GONNA BE JUST FINE. I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME? THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY. - WE'LL BE WATCHING YOU, DEAR. JUST TO HELP OUT AND ALL. - I'M SURE YOU WILL. GOODBYE. LET ME CLUE YOU IN, BEING A PASTOR'S WIFE IS LIKE LIVING IN A FISH BOWL WHERE ANYBODY AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THINKS THEY CAN JUST PEER IN AND CHECK WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS, OH MY. OH, MY, THEY JUST GO AND PUT THE FAMILY IN SOME SORT OF PEDESTAL PERFECTION OR SOMETHING. THE TRUTH IS NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE KIDS ARE, THEY CAN NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH. EVAN! - IT'S 7:00 O'CLOCK. WE NEED TO GET STARTED. I'LL CALL THIS MEETING TO ORDER. TOMMIE, WILL YOU OPEN IN PRAYER? - LORD, PLEASE ALLOW WHATEVER HAPPENS THIS EVENING BE PLEASING IN YOUR SIGHT. IN CHRIST'S NAME, AMEN. - GROUP: AMEN. - OKAY, ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH CLERK, THE SIGN-IN SHEET SHOWS 12 MEMBERS PRESENT. - OUT OF HOW MANY? - 21. - SOME ON THAT LIST DON'T ATTEND HERE ANYMORE. - WE MOVED SOME TO INACTIVE STATUS HOPING THEY'D COME BACK. - LUCRETIA HOWARD IS STILL ON THAT LIST. - SO? - DIDN'T SHE DIE THREE YEARS AGO? - THAT'S A PROBLEM. - WE'LL HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM IF SHE SHOWS UP. [LAUGHTER] LET'S SEND OUT A LETTER TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF THOSE FOLKS. IF THEY DON'T RESPOND OR WRITE BACK SAYING THEY'RE ATTENDING ELSEWHERE, WE CAN WEED OUT THE ROSTER. - FINE. ON TO THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY. AS WE ALL KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A SHORTAGE OF TRUSTEES. WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS WHO STEPPED FORWARD TO VOLUNTEER: TOMMIE AND STEWART. WITHOUT OBJECTION? ALL RIGHT THEN, PASTOR'S REPORT. - WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WE'RE STILL FALLING SHORT. I'M GONNA ASK STEWART TO HELP ME PASS OUT OUR LATEST FINANCIAL REPORT, COURTESY OF BRAX. BRAX, DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING? - AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE REPORT, FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS, OUR EXPENSES HAVE EXCEEDED OUR INCOME. NOW, WITH THE INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE, IT'S GETTING BETTER BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PUT US IN THE BLACK. AND THE DEFICIT NOW IS NOT A RESULT OF THESE EXPENSES. UTILITIES, CONTRACT OF SERVICES, INSURANCE, IT'S ALL ON BUDGET. THE SHORTFALL IS IN THE GENERAL INCOME. - IF WE CONTINUE ON OUR PRESENT PATH, WE'LL BE BROKE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. - I'M SURE WE'RE ALL WORKING VARY HARD TO BRING IN NEW PEOPLE TO CHURCH AND THAT WILL BRING IN MORE SUPPORT. - LONG TERM, YES. BUT IN THE SHORT-TERM, WE NEED TO MEET OUR EXPENSES. - WELL, THERE'S A WAY TO GET US BACK ON TRACK WITHOUT REQUIRING ONE MORE DOLLAR FROM ANYONE. - HERE WE GO. - CURRENTLY, WE'RE COLLECTING A SEPARATE OFFERING FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS AND WE'RE KEEPING THAT MONEY IN A SEPARATE ACCOUNT. I MAKE A MOTION THAT THE MISSIONS BANK ACCOUNT BE CLOSED AND MERGED INTO THE GENERAL ACCOUNT. IN THE FUTURE, ALL FOREIGN MISSIONS GIVING WILL BE REDUCED TO A FLAT 10% OF THE TOTAL CHURCH INCOME. - AND THAT WON'T REQUIRE US TO ASK FOR ANOTHER MISSION'S OFFERING ANYMORE. AND THEN WE CAN PAY ALL OF OUR BILLS RIGHT HERE. - AND AS THE CHURCH GROWS, SO WILL FOREIGN MISSIONS GIVING. - SO YOU HATE FOREIGN MISSIONS. - I DON'T HATE FOREIGN MISSIONS. LOOK, WE HAVE PROBLEMS RIGHT HERE. ALL AROUND US, HERE IN CONNERSVILLE. REMEMBER MATTHEW 6? IT SAYS FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO. WE CAN'T KEEP SENDING A DOLLAR OVERSEAS AND IGNORING OUR NEIGHBORS AND THINK WE'RE HONORING THE GREAT COMMISSION. - BUT PASTOR, IF WE CONTINUE TO KEEP GIVING IN FAITH-- - IT TAKES FAITH TO GIVE AND WORK AT HOME TOO. BESIDES, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN GIVING IN FAITH AND ACTING IN IGNORANCE. - ARE YOU SAYING MY MOTHER IS IGNORANT? - NO. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD STEWARDS, RIGHT? WELL, RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT. NOT EVEN WITH OUR OWN BUILDING. - THE BUILDING? - YEAH. WHAT ABOUT THE BACK CORNER OF THE SANCTUARY? THE CEILING IS BAD. IT LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE EVERY BIG RAIN AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. AND THAT RAFTER IN THAT SPOT, IT'S IN NEED OF A BAD INSPECTION. - THAT CEILING'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME BRAX, AND IT CAN WAIT A LITTLE LONGER. WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THINGS. - WE REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. - ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TELL THE MISSIONARIES TOO BAD? WE WANT THE MONEY FOR OURSELVES? - VINCE HAS A POINT, EVAN. THEY COUNT ON SUPPORT FROM HOME. - ESPECIALLY THE LAYFIELDS. - I KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS, AND I'M SORRY. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY CHURCH SENDING THEM AN OFFERING. - THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IS MOOT. THE BYLAWS CLEARLY STATE THAT THE MISSIONS COMMITTEE HAS FULL OVERSIGHT OVER MISSIONS SPENDING. - ABOUT THE BYLAWS, THEY COULD USE A GOOD WORKING OVER. THEY'RE ALL MUDDLED UP AND OUT OF TOUCH THE WAY THEY ARE. THEY NEED A GOOD DOSE OF CLARITY AND FLEXIBILITY. - THE BIBLE'S NOT FLEXIBLE. - THE BYLAWS ARE NOT THE BIBLE. - SO DOES THE BODY HAVE A SAY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHURCH OR NOT? - BUT WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY BEFORE. - WHAT ABOUT THE VOTE TO CALL THE PASTOR? WASN'T THAT A MEMBERSHIP DECISION? - BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT. - YOU KNEW THIS WAS A COMMITTEE RUN CHURCH WHEN YOU CAME HERE. - NO, I THOUGHT THIS WAS COMMITTEE LED CHURCH. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS COMMITTEE RUN UNTIL I'D BEEN HERE A WHILE. I'M GOING TO ASK THE DEACONS AND TRUSTEES TO LOOK OVER THE BYLAWS WITH ME IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER SOME PLACES WHERE WE CAN TWEAK IT FOR THE BETTER OF OUR CHURCH. - PASTOR, YOUR PROPOSALS AND ACTIONS MAKE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ME WILL NOT DISAGREE WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT IN YOU. THEREFORE, SPIRITUALLY YOU MUST BE WRONG. - EXCUSE ME? - THIS PLAN IS SIMPLE. I AM SURE OF IT. - I THINK YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSING YOUR OWN FEELINGS WITH GOD'S LAW. - I'M JUST SAYING THAT I THINK THE MEMBERSHIP HERE RECOGNIZES THE REAL PROBLEM. THAT'S ALL. - OKAY. LET'S ASK THEM. DO I HEAR A SECOND ON MY EMERGENCY BUDGET PROPOSAL? - SECOND. - THERE BEING A SECOND, ALL IN FAVOR OF PASTOR EVANS' MISSIONS CUTTING PROPOSAL, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. OPPOSED? THE AYES HAVE IT. - I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE. - HE PREACHES FRIENDSHIP, BUT HE'S NOT A FRIEND TO THOSE WHO HIRED HIM. - HE NEEDS TO HONOR THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO WERE HERE FIRST. ALWAYS VISITING ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE. - AND HIS WIFE, NOT SUBMISSIVE AT ALL. - OUR FAMILY'S BEEN HERE A LONG TIME AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LET SOME FLY-BY- NIGHT PASTOR CHANGE THAT. - AND WE CAN'T COMPROMISE WITH EVIL. - AS LONG AS WE FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT, GOD WILL BLESS OUR EFFORTS, THAT'S FOR SURE. - BOY, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF? - WHAT IS THIS? - OH, YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL ABOUT THAT LETTER. - SIT DOWN, BRAX. PLEASE. WHEN DID YOU GET THIS? - THIS MORNING AT THE HARDWARE STORE AND EVERYONE THERE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. - I DID NOT MEAN FOR THIS TO GET MAILED YET. I WROTE IT IN CASE THINGS GOT WORSE AND WELL, YOU KNOW. - THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT OUR CONGREGATION HAS SEEN DIVISION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU NO LONGER PERMIT PASTOR EVAN BENNETT OR HIS WIFE ELENA TO CHARGE ANYMORE ITEMS TO THE CHURCH ACCOUNT. BOY, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? - I WAS THINKING THAT THE DAY MAY COME WHEN PASTOR EVAN IS NO LONGER PASTOR. - WELL, UNTIL THAT DAY DOES COME, HE IS. AND THIS LETTER-- - GLORIA MUST HAVE SEEN THE LETTERS AND THOUGHT-- - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, LETTERS PLURAL? - I HAD ONE FOR EACH OF THE STORES WHERE THE CHURCH HAS AN ACCOUNT. - WELL, YOU ARE GONNA WRITE EACH OF THOSE STORES A NEW ONE RESCINDING THIS FRAUDULENT LETTER RIGHT AWAY. DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD THIS MAKES US LOOK? - JUST COOL IT, BRAX. WE ARE DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF THAT OURSELVES. INFIGHTING AT THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS, VISITORS LEAVING. I HEARD THE HODGE FAMILY ISN'T COMING BACK ANYMORE. - WELL, BEFORE WE CAN KEEP NEW FAMILIES, THIS UNDERCURRENT DIVISION HAS GOT TO BE ELIMINATED. - IT'S EVAN'S DOING YOU KNOW. - YOU KNOW WHAT, YOUR IN- LAWS CAN GET RID OF THIS PASTOR, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, HIS REPLACEMENT IS EITHER GONNA HAVE TO CAPTAIN A SINKING SHIP TO ITS DEPTHS OR HE'S GONNA FIGHT THE STATUS QUO AND HE'S GONNA SUFFER FOR IT. - I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN BE SEEN BACKING YOU. - BACKING WHOM? WAIT. I WITHDRAW THE QUESTION. - LOOK, I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR ALL OF THAT. - GREAT. - THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM LOTS OF CHURCHES. I'VE WAITED ON TOO MANY TO COUNT. MOST OF THEM DON'T GIVE ME A SECOND THOUGHT. WELL, EXCEPT WHEN THEY WANTED TO WHISPER ABOUT ME AND MY CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT EVAN, HE'S DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW? HE JUST TALKS TO ME LIKE I MATTER. HE'S BEEN TRYING TO DO A LOT AROUND THIS TOWN AND NOT GETTING MUCH SUPPORT FROM FOLKS LIKE YOU I GUESS. - HOLD ON A MINUTE, KIM. - I SEEM TO RECALL CHRIST WASN'T TOO POPULAR WITH THE RELIGIOUS FOLK OF HIS DAY. MAYBE EVAN'S HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS RELIGIOUS FOLKS TOO. - YOU DON'T GO SO YOU DON'T KNOW. - YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME I START GOING TO CHURCH AGAIN. MAYBE A BUNCH OF US SHOULD. MAYBE IF ME AND MY BOY AND MY NEIGHBOR AND EVEN YOU STARTED LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHATEVER EVAN KNOWS, WE MIGHT START DOING MORE OF WHATEVER EVAN DOES. - I'M NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING EVAN. I WANT TO KNOW CHRIST. - I WONDER, WOULD CHRIST KNOW YOU? - NOT NOW, GUYS. TURN THAT OFF. I SAID NOT-- - EVAN? HEY. PLEASE TALK TO ME. - I CAN'T RIGHT NOW. I HAVE A DEACONS MEETING IN A BIT. OR SHOULD I SAY ONE LESS DEACON MEETING. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - MARCUS IS JUMPING SHIP. I JUST GOT A LETTER FROM HIM SAYING HE'S DONE WITH THE WHOLE DEACONS THING. - HE'S QUITTING THE CHURCH? - NOT THAT I KNOW OF, JUST THE DEACON'S BOARD. - WHY? - I THINK YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHY. - HEY. I'M NOT THE ENEMY. - I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS I CAN TAKE. EVERYDAY, EVERY MEETING, EVERY SERVICE, THE BYLAWS, IT'S JUST ONE STRUGGLE AFTER ANOTHER. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY, THE HAMAN FAMILY IS THERE WATCHING. - I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO SO FAST WITH THOSE CHANGES YOU HAD IN MIND. ESPECIALLY AFTER FINDING OUT ABOUT THEIR MISSIONARY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. - I DON'T NEED AN "I TOLD YOU SO" LECTURE RIGHT NOW. - THIS IS NOT A LECTURE. - THEN WHAT IT IS, ELENA? I HAVE THIS CHURCH THAT'S DYING ALL AROUND ME, A TOWN IN NEED, AND ONE FAMILY SEEMING TO BLOCK IT ALL. TRYING TO HOLD ON TO SOME LITTLE KINGDOM OF THEIRS. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE? - NOT ALIENATED THEM, THAT'S WHAT. - HEY, I SEEM TO RECALL YOU HAD A RUN-IN OR TWO ABOUT THE KIDS, RIGHT? - THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. I KNOW YOU. I KNOW HOW YOU CAN GET WHEN YOU GET ALL WORKED UP. I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. YOU'RE GONNA BURN YOURSELF OUT IN FRUSTRATION. YOU MARK MY WORDS, THIS WILL HAUNT YOU. - YOU GO HAVE YOUR MEETING NOW AND THINK ABOUT THIS. - I'M SORRY I'M LATE, GENTLEMEN. - WAIT A MINUTE. BYLAW CHANGES? - RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A WHILE NOW. - I WANT TO KNOW WHEN WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM. - WE HAVEN'T EVEN OPENED UP IN PRAYER YET, VINCENT. - THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM IS YOU. YOUR PREACHING MAY BE SKILLFUL, BUT YOUR MOTIVES ARE TRANSPARENT. YOU DESIRE TO DO THINGS YOUR OWN WAY, AND IT IS CERTAINLY CLEAR THAT CHURCH POLICY IS FOREIGN TO YOU. DID YOU EVEN READ OUR CONSTITUTION BEFORE YOU ACCEPTED THIS POSITION? - VINCE, LET'S HOLD OFF ON THIS DISCUSSION A BIT. WHERE IS BRAX? - HE SAID HE WASN'T SURE IF HE WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TONIGHT. - YOU SEE? EVERYONE'S ABANDONING YOU, PASTOR. FIRST MARCUS. WHO'S NEXT? - I DON'T THINK BRAX MEANT ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT NOT BEING HERE TONIGHT. - VINCENT HAMAN, YOU CLEARLY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE AROUND HERE. YOU HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO CONFOUND EVERY CHANGE. THIS CONFLICT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE CREATING IS DRIVING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE CHURCH. THE WAY I SEE IT, WE HAVE FOUR OPTIONS. FIRST, I COULD DO NOTHING. PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE THE CHURCH IN FRUSTRATION AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO WHITHER AWAY ON THE VINE. THE UPSIDE IS YOU WON'T HAVE ANYONE TO FIGHT WITH SO THINGS WILL CALM DOWN. IF I LEAVE, IT WILL BE ABOUT THE SAME. - ARE YOU LEAVING? - YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT! IF YOU AND YOUR CLICK WOULD JUST CALM DOWN THE AGGRESSIVE RHETORIC AND JOIN WITH THE MAJORITY OF FAMILIES WHO WANT TO SEE CHANGE. - THEY AREN'T MEMBERS. - YET! - OR MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TURN A PAGE. THEY SAY IT'S BETTER TO BE BROTHERS IN CHRIST UNDER SEPARATE ROOFS THAN SIBLING RIVALS UNDER ONE. - WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING? THAT I SHOULD LEAVE? - YOU MIGHT FIND ANOTHER CHURCH THAT SHARES YOUR PREFERENCE ON NON LOCAL MINISTRY. - THIS IS RICH. YOU SWAGGER IN HERE SIX MONTHS AGO, READY TO SAVE THE WORLD. WE HIRED YOU. WE DID! AND NOW YOU WANT US TO LEAVE? - AS LONG AS YOU AND I ARE BOTH HERE, WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER IN CHRIST OR THIS CHURCH WILL FALL APART. - GENTLEMEN, I AM TOO OLD FOR THIS. DOESN'T THE PSALMS TEACH US THAT IT'S A GOOD THING AND A PLEASANT THING FOR BRETHREN TO DWELL TOGETHER IN THE SPIRIT OF UNITY? IF WE'RE GONNA SAVE THIS CHURCH, WE HAVE TO DO IT IN THE SPIRIT OF UNITY. - WHAT ARE YOU TYING TO SAY, MR. FRITZ? - I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'M GONNA NEED LOTS OF TIME FOR LOTS OF PRAYER. SO THE BEST THING THAT YOU FOLKS CAN DO IS TO FIND ANOTHER PERSON TO TAKE MY PLACE AS THE DEACON. - YOU SEE WHAT HE'S DONE? - WHAT I'VE DONE? WE NEED TO JUST-- - THERE'S NO WE. YOU'RE DOWN TO ONE DEACON. ME. WITHOUT ME, THAT JUST LEAVES YOU. WHY DON'T YOU TRY THAT ONE ON FOR SIZE, PASTOR. - VINCENT, THIS CHURCH NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. - I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT COMPROMISE MY BELIEFS. THIS IS A SPIRITUAL BATTLE, AND AS LONG AS YOU ARE HERE, SATAN HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON THIS CHURCH. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, YOU HAVE MY RESIGNATION AS A DEACON. - YOU'RE GONNA ACCUSE ME? ACCUSE THIS CHURCH AND THEN JUST LEAVE? - DID I SAY I WAS LEAVING THE CHURCH? OH, NO SIR. JUST YOUR PUPPET BOARD. AND WE'LL SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN LAST WITHOUT DEACONS AND LEADERSHIP, AND WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO. - WHAT WAS THAT? - HEY DEAR. GET EVERYONE TOGETHER. I'VE GOT AN IDEA. - I THINK THE HAMAN'S ARE TRYING TO STRANGLE HIS IDEAS AND, I MEAN, I KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO HELP OUT PEOPLE OVERSEAS, BUT WE'VE GOT TO HELP THINGS HERE IN THE CHURCH. - CHURCH IS A FAMILY, OF COURSE, BUT YOU KNOW LIKE ANY FAMILY YOU CAN BE DYSFUNCTIONAL. - IF THERE IS A PAST THAT I MAY HAVE HAD THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GET ON CAMERA, BUT YEAH, I THINK BEING ACTIVE IN THIS CHURCH HAS BROUGHT MY FAMILY TOGETHER, MUCH CLOSER. - AND I THINK THAT THEY TAKE EVERYTHING PERSONALLY, PROBABLY TOO PERSONALLY. - SOMEHOW THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF PASTOR EVAN. I THINK EVERYBODY WILL BE VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT SOME OF HIS REACTIONS TO ALL OF THIS. - FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT. JUST WHEN WE WERE GETTING SO CLOSE-- - WHAT'S THAT? - WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? - THEY'VE SET UP A MEETING CALLING FOR EVAN TO GET FIRED. - THEY CAN'T DO THAT. - ALL THEY NEED IS FIVE MEMBERS TO CALL A VOTE. - SEE THE SIGNATURES? - EVEN IF THEY CALL THE MEETING THOUGH, THEY STILL HAVE TO GET THE VOTES. - YEAH, WE WEEDED OUT THE MEMBERSHIP ROSTER JUST A BIT. - THERE'S STILL A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ON IT. ALL THEY NEED IS A MAJORITY VOTE. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK THEY CAN FIND AND FILL WITH NONSENSE. - NOT LUCRETIA HOWARD. - WHO DIED? - WE DID. - THEY WANT TO HAVE THE MEETING AND THEN YOU'RE GONE THREE WEEKS AFTER THAT? - HONEY? - LORD, WE ARE AT THE END OF OURSELVES HERE. WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS DONE THINGS THE WAY WE SHOULD HAVE. THIS IS YOUR CHURCH, THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE, AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF MINISTRY LEFT TO DO HERE. IF YOU WANT US TO KEEP PRESSING ON, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO OPEN UP THE DOOR AND SHOW US THE WAY. WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU. AMEN. - AMEN. - I HAVE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE FIRST ONE IS NOT A HAPPY ONE, PER SAY, BUT I AM REQUIRED TO ANNOUNCE A SPECIAL MEETING CALLED FOR THIS FRIDAY. EXCUSE ME. - FRIDAY? - JUST A MINUTE, FOLKS. - NOW THEY WOULDN'T BE THAT CARELESS AS TO VIOLATE THEIR OWN BYLAWS, WOULD THEY? - IT'S HARD TO THINK STRAIGHT WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY. - CHECK THE DATE. - FRIDAY. RIGHT THERE. - THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T DO THIS. - THEY CAN JUST NOT THIS FRIDAY. THEY'LL COME BACK NEXT SUNDAY WITH A PROPER WARNING. THAT GIVES US A COUPLE OF WEEKS. - GOD HAS BOUGHT US SOME EXTRA TIME. - SO WHAT DO WE DO? - FOLKS, THAT MEETING THAT WAS CALLED FOR FRIDAY HAS BEEN POSTPONED. THE BYLAWS SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT ALL MEETINGS MUST BE GIVEN TWO WEEKS NOTICE. SO SPEAKING OF MEETING ANNOUNCEMENTS, THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL MEETING HELD TWO MONDAYS FROM NOW ON THE 18TH. - THERE WILL BE? - YEP, THIS MEETING IS BEING CALLED TO VOTE IN NEW MEMBERS. A SIGN UP LIST WILL BE GOING AROUND AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER CHURCH TOO. OF COURSE, ALL POTENTIAL MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO BE INTERVIEWED AND BE BAPTIZED. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR HAVE YET TO BE BAPTIZED, PLEASE SEE ME RIGHT AWAY AFTER SERVICE. - I BELIEVE THAT WILL HELP BALANCE OUT THINGS QUITE A BIT. ANYTHING ELSE? - SECOND, AS YOU KNOW THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN WORKING ON A NEW SET OF BYLAWS FOR SOMETIME NOW. WELL, THOSE PROPOSALS ARE NOW READY FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. - THE BYLAWS. RIGHT. - THIS SPECIAL MEETING WILL GIVE MEMBERS CURRENT AND NEW A CHANCE TO VOTE TO MAKE OUR CHURCH BETTER SUITED TO GROW AND MOVE FORWARD IN THE FUTURE AND SINCE FIVE MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO CALL A MEETING, I'M ASKING THAT FIVE FOLKS HERE ARE ABLE TO HELP US OUT. - DON'T YOU MEAN FOUR? WHAT ABOUT YOU, PASTOR? - I'D RATHER THAT IT BE CALLED BY YOU GUYS. IF WE CAN'T GET FIVE PEOPLE HERE-- - COUNT ME IN. - ME TOO. - THANK YOU. EACH OF YOU. OH, SINCE OUR MODERATOR WILL MOST ASSUREDLY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION, AND IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A MODERATOR TO NOT BE MODERATE, I SUGGEST THAT WE SECURE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY TO BE A MODERATOR FOR THAT EVENING. - WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS. IF THE LORD DOESN'T BUILD UP THIS HOUSE, WE LABOR IN VAIN. [MUSIC] - WHAT IS THAT? - EVAN? EVAN? - YEAH. - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING SO FAST. PLEASE DON'T MIND THE CAMERA. PLEASE, THIS WAY. - AND WHERE IS THE NOTE NOW? - HERE. - INTERESTING. - I'D SAY IT'S INTERESTING. WE'RE NOT USED TO GETTING THREATS IN THE MAIL. - AND THERE WERE NO ADDRESSES OR SIGNATURES OR ANY IDENTIFYING MARKS ON OR ATTACHED TO THIS? - NO. BUT TRUST ME, WE'VE GOT A PRETTY SHORT LIST OF WHO IT COULD BE. - I CAN LOOK INTO THIS BUT WITHOUT ANY LINKS TO THE SENDER, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO PIN THIS ON ANYONE IN PARTICULAR. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE MEANTIME? IT WENT FROM CHURCH SQUABBLES TO DEATH THREATS. HOW IS MY FAMILY SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAFE ANYMORE? - MA'AM, I'LL KEEP MY EYES AND EARS OPEN AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU. - WELL, BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH! - ELENA. OFFICER COOGAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS. - YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN HEARING STORIES AROUND TOWN ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER HERE. PERSONALLY I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING, BUT SOME FOLKS JUST DON'T LIKE CHANGE. - WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY BEFORE. - YEAH. LOOK, IF I WERE YOU I WOULD TAKE STEPS TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE. GIVE ME A FEW DAYS. WE'LL TALK AGAIN. - OKAY. THANK YOU AGAIN. I'LL WALK YOU OUT. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] - SO MOM GOT THIS CALL, RIGHT. AND EVERY TIME SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE -- - NO ONE WAS THERE. - WHO'S TELLING THIS STORY? ANYWAY, SO SHE GETS THESE CALLS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. - NO CALLER ID. - TREVOR! - JUST A MINUTE, ROSE. YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE. FINALLY, SHE GETS THIS ONE CALL FROM SOME WOMAN. MOM NEVER TOLD ME WHAT THE WOMAN SAID, BUT SHE WAS SCARED. REAL SCARED. - TREVOR, HURRY UP! - WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, ROSE? [HONKING] [SCREAMING] - THEY'RE OKAY, AREN'T THEY? - JUST SOME SCRAPES AND BRUISES FROM THE BUSHES. WE WERE LUCKY. - THIS TIME. - ANYONE SEE WHO DID IT? - NO. NOT THAT WE KNOW. THE POLICE ARE CHECKING AROUND. - I'M SO SORRY. - NOT AS SORRY AS I AM. - SO LISTEN, ELENA -- - NO. NO, EVAN, YOU LISTEN TO ME. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT THIS. THE KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SAFER STAYING AT MY MOM'S, AND I'M GOING WITH THEM. - THIS CAN STILL BE FIXED, YOU KNOW. THE CHURCH CAN STILL BE SAVED. IN A COUPLE DAYS WE HAVE THE MEETING. - THE CHURCH. THE CHURCH. WOW. THAT'S ALL I HEAR ABOUT! THE CHURCH. WHAT ABOUT US? WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS? OUR FAMILY? DON'T YOU CARE? I LOVE YOU. I DO. BUT WE'RE JUST NOT SAFE HERE ANYMORE. - OKAY. I CAN I UNDERSTAND SENDING THE KIDS, BUT WHY YOU? I NEED YOU HERE. - WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR? I'M JUST ANOTHER TARGET. - LOOK, I KNOW I CAN BE A HOT HEAD. - YOU AND YOUR SKIRMISH WITH THE HAMANS. - I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS WHEN I LOOK BACK WHEN THIS IS OVER AND SAY YEAH, I COULD HAVE DONE THAT DIFFERENT. BETTER. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MY ROCK FOR DISCERNMENT. YOU ALWAYS SEE THINGS. - WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN? - I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT GOD BROUGHT US HERE FOR A REASON. DIDN'T HE? I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF. I LOVE YOU, YOU KNOW. - YEAH. I KNOW. YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO. YOU HAVE TO LET ME DO THIS. I HAVE TO PICK UP THE KIDS, AND THE TRAIN LEAVES IN AN HOUR. I HAVE TO GO. - OKAY. DO ME A FAVOR, PLEASE. - WHAT? - PRAY FOR ME. [MUSIC] - I JUST -- [PHONE RINGS] - THIS IS PROBABLY ELENA. I'LL PUT THIS ON SPEAKER FOR YOU GUYS. - EGYPT VALLEY. - IS THIS YOU? EVAN? - WALT? - YEAH. HEY, I NEED YOU TO MEET ME AT THE DINER TOMORROW MORNING. THE USUAL TIME. - I'M EXTREMELY BUSY FOR A BIG MEETING TOMORROW, WALT. - YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MEET ME FOR THIS REVELATION. - WHAT IS IT? - I WAS LATE GETTING HOME FROM THE STATION TWO NIGHTS AGO, AROUND OVER BY YOUR PLACE. - YES. - I SAW IT, EVAN. I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING. THE CAR. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW. GOTTA GO. - WAIT A MINUTE. WALT? WALT? [LOUD NOISE] - WHAT WAS THAT? ANYONE OUT THERE? KIM, DID I MISS WALT? - UM, I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY MISSES WALT. - SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. - NO. HE HASN'T BEEN IN HERE YET. I THINK I'D REMEMBER THAT. WAIT. WHAT TIME IS IT? THAT'S WEIRD. HE'S ALWAYS IN HERE BY NOW. EVERY DAY. [MUSIC] - EVAN? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FOLLOW HIM! FOLLOW HIM! GET THE CAR. [POLICE SIREN WAILS] - WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE, PASTOR. I CANNOT LET YOU THROUGH HERE RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THOSE CAMERAS. NO. NO. NO. LOOK, WALT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. - WHAT HAPPENED? - WELL, HE FELL AND HIT HIS HEAD. - THIS MIGHT NOT BE SO ACCIDENTAL. - AND WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT? - I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH HIM RIGHT NOW AT THE DINER. HE SAID HE SAW WHO TRIED TO HIT MY KIDS. - DID HE SAY WHO? - NO. HE WAS GOING TO TELL ME EVERYTHING TODAY. IF THIS ISN'T AN ACCIDENT --DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CHURCH MEETING TONIGHT? - WELL, YES I KNOW ABOUT THE MEETING. EVERYONE IN CONNORSVILLE KNOWS ABOUT THAT MEETING. - FIRST WITH THE KIDS AND NOW WALT. WHO KNOWS WHAT SOMEBODY IS CAPABLE OF. - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, PASTOR? - I'M THINKING THE MEN'S FELLOWSHIP NEEDS TO GET TOGETHER. - WELL, ALL RIGHT. I NEED TO GO AHEAD AND GET BACK INSIDE, BUT PLEASE, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. - YEAH. IF YOU COULD DRIVE AROUND THE CHURCH LATER, JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR SOME TROUBLE. - I'VE ALREADY PLANNED ON IT. - THANKS. [MUSIC] - STEWART? - YEAH. - GO BE WITH WALT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER AT THE MEETING. - SURE YOU DON'T NEED ME RIGHT NOW? - YEAH. [DOOR SLAMS] - ELENA? - WHAT'S GOING ON? LISTEN, I THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING KIM SAID. I CANNOT USE OTHER PEOPLE AS AN EXCUSE ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET FEAR OR A FAMILY OF PHARISEES GET IN THE WAY. THEY'RE OUT TO DESTROY THIS CHURCH AND MY FAMILY AND I WON'T LET THIS HAPPEN, SO I'M BACK. - UH, GENTLEMEN, I DO BELIEVE THIS IS OUR CUE TO LEAVE. WE'LL SEE YOU LATER, PASTOR. - SO WHAT DID I MISS? - MY HUSBAND DOESN'T GET OUT TO CHURCH MUCH. BUT FOR THIS HE'LL COME. - THANK YOU. - WHY AM I HERE? WHY ARE WE HERE? - BECAUSE I NEED YOUR VOTE, HONEY. - VOTE. OKAY. - WHERE'S STEWART? HE'S GOING TO BE LATE. - OH. HE CALLED HE'S WITH HIS DAD AT THE HOSPITAL. HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HE'S SORRY. - HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SORRY ABOUT THAT. MAN! JUST PUTS US IN A FIX. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE NUMBERS OR NOT. - YEAH. - LET'S GET GOING. LET'S GET STARTED, EVERYONE. HELLO. THANKS FOR COMING OUT. LET'S KEEP STEWART'S FATHER IN OUR PRAYER. WALT TOOK A BAD FALL DOWN AT THE STATION EARLIER TODAY, AND HE'S IN THE ICU AS WE SPEAK. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MAYOR URBAN IS AN ELDER AT HIS CHURCH AND HE HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO SERVE AS TONIGHT'S MODERATOR PRO TEM. WITHOUT OBJECTION? THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING ME TO COME OVER THIS EVENING TO DO THIS JOB AS MODERATOR. I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS. BEFORE WE START, I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH PRAYER IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. LET US BOW TOGETHER. OUR FATHER, WE'VE COME HERE TONIGHT WITH HEAVY HEARTS. WE'VE COME HERE TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THIS CHURCH. OH GOD, WE ASK THAT AS THIS BUSINESS BEGIN THAT HARMONY AND PEACE, LET US LEAVE IN JOY. AND OH GOD, WE ASK THAT YOU BE WITH EACH ONE THAT'S HERE TONIGHT, THAT NOT OUR WILL BUT YOUR WILL BE DONE. FOR WE ASK THAT IN THE NAME OF CHRIST, AMEN. FIRST ON OUR AGENDA TONIGHT IS TO VOTE TO ACCEPT NEW MEMBERS. - MR. MODERATOR, POINT OF ORDER. - ON WHAT GROUNDS? - THE BYLAWS CLEARLY STATE THAT ANY CANDIDATE FOR MEMBERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO BE INTERVIEWED BY LEADERSHIP, BUT WE HAVE NO DEACONS IN LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW. - I HAVE INTERVIEWED THESE CANDIDATES AND THE LAST TIME I CHECKED THE PASTOR IS STILL CONSIDERED LEADERSHIP. THEY HAVE ALL PROFESSED THEIR FAITH IN CHRIST AND EVIDENCE OF BAPTISM. IN FACT, JUST THIS LAST WEEK ONE CANDIDATE WAS BAPTIZED IN THE COMMUNITY POOL. - I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE OBJECTION. - JUST A MINUTE. I HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR CANDIDATES. - WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING, BERTHA? - TAKE FOR INSTANCE THAT WOMAN. YOU KNOW ALL KNOW THAT WOMAN HAS A CHILD AND SHE'S NEVER BEEN MARRIED. NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN STANDARDS IN OUR CHURCH THAT WE HAVE TO ADHERE TO. DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A TRAMP LIKE THAT AS A MEMBER OF OUR CONGREGATION? - WAIT A MINUTE! THE FORGIVENESS OF CHRIST IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN OUR PAST AND HIS FUTURE. EACH ONE OF US HAVE DONE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT PROUD OF. AND NOBODY IS ANY BETTER IN THIS ROOM THAN ANYONE ELSE. AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND LET YOU TEAR DOWN A SISTER IN CHRIST JUST BECAUSE WHERE SHE HAS BEEN. SHE'S HERE NOW WITH US, WITH CHRIST. CAN WE JUDGE TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THAT? - WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PAPER BALLOT VOTE. IF THE SECRETARY WOULD PLEASE PASS OUT THE PAPER BALLOTS? [MUSIC] - THANK YOU. HERE ARE THE TOTALS. WE HAVE 6 VOTES IN FAVOR. WE HAVE 1 PERSON THAT HAS ABSTAINED. - I WONDER WHO DID THAT. - AND 5 AGAINST. WELCOME, NEW MEMBERS, TO THE EGYPT VALLEY CHURCH. [APPLAUSE] - THAT WAS JUST AN OPENING VOLLEY. THE REAL BATTLE IS COMING UP. - THE SECOND PART OF THIS MEETING TONIGHT IS TO ACCEPT THE BYLAWS. I HAVE BEEN GRACIOUSLY INFORMED BY VINCENT HAMAN THAT THE CURRENT BYLAWS REQUIRE A SUPER MAJORITY IN ORDER TO PASS. - 70%. - IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? - I HAVE A COMMENT. - SOMEHOW I'M NOT SURPRISED. - WE WERE ONCE KNOWN ALL OVER AS A CHURCH THAT SUPPORTED MISSIONS. NOW WE'VE LOST THAT. WE'RE TOO BUSY WORRIED ABOUT NEW THINGS. WE GAVE UP OUR HERITAGE FOR THE SAKE OF SOME SUPPOSED NEW OUTREACH EFFORT. WHY? WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY BEFORE. WHY CHANGE NOW? - HOW CAN WE TELL THE WORLD HOW TO LIVE IF WE CAN'T LIVE IT AT HOME? - AND SPEAKING OF HOME, THIS SUPPOSED PASTOR AND HIS FAMILY SHOULD BE EXAMPLES OF GOOD CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOR, BUT WHAT DOES HE DO? HE INSULTS AND HURTS MY FAMILY WHEN WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SERVE OUR CHURCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, MARCUS? AND THEIR KIDS, THEY'RE SO WORLDLY. WITH ALL THEIR ROUGH PLAY AND SECULAR ACTIVITIES AND UNKEMPT APPEARANCE. AND TREVOR, WITH HIS ARMY GAMES. FRANKLY I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE DIDN'T KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP SOME DAY. - POINT OF ORDER! MR. MODERATOR, THIS ENTIRE TRIAL AGAINST OUR PASTOR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTIONS OF THE NEW BYLAWS. - ON THE CONTRARY, IT DOES. WOULD WE BE HERE RIGHT NOW IF NOT FOR HIM? - NO. BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, OUR CHURCH WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED A LONG TIME AGO. - WHAT MY HUSBAND IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED A FRESH START, AND THIS MAY BE THE LAST CHANCE THAT GOD GIVES THIS CHURCH TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES. - AS MODERATOR, I'M GOING TO JUMP IN HERE. I THINK WE'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES OF THIS DISCUSSION. I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THE PAPER BALLOTS. - I CALL FOR A VOICE VOTE, A MEMBER BY MEMBER VOICE VOTE, A PRIVILEGE PERMITTED IN THE REAL BYLAWS. EACH MEMBER ONE AT A TIME STATE THEIR POSITION OUT LOUD. - FINE. ONE BY ONE I'LL HAVE EACH ONE OF YOU VOTE. TELL US HOW YOU WANT TO VOTE. - NO. - NO. - YES. - YES. - YES. - NO. - NO. - YES. - YES. - YES. - YES. - YES. - YES. - YES. - NO. - UM --LOOK, I KNOW WHAT I'VE SAID AND DONE, AND I KNOW THAT EVAN HAS HURT. HE HURT YOU, BUT I'M SORRY, GLORIA. I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. I KNOW THAT FAMILY IS IMPORTANT, BUT WE ALL SAID THIS CHURCH NEEDED NEW LIFE. BUT DID WE MEAN IT? IF WE KEPT GOING THE WAY WE WERE, WE'D JUST BE FOOLING OURSELVES AND HURTING THE FAITH WE SAY WE BELIEVE. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE NOW. IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE, I HAVE TO GIVE EGYPT VALLEY A CHANCE. I AM SORRY. BUT NO MATTER THE COST I HAVE TO VOTE YES. - THAT MAKES THE VOTE 11 TO 5. SO IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT, THAT'S 68.75%. THEREFORE THE BYLAWS FAIL. [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] - NOW JUST WAIT A COTTON PICKING MINUTE. MR. MAYOR. - MR. FRITZ, WELCOME. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. - SON, I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS HERE CHURCH FOR SOME 62 YEARS NOW. I THINK THAT ENTITLES ME TO A VOTE. - I'D SAY SO. - WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN. YOU FOLKS OUT HERE I'VE BEEN WATCHING ALL OF YOU FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. I'M SEEING PROBLEMS COME IN AND GO OUT AND BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH. NOTHING GETS SOLVED. EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM WHEN THE ONLY VOICE WE OUGHT TO BE LISTENING TO IS THE VOICE OF GOD. I PRAYED AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD WORKS THAT'S BEEN DONE HERE AT CHURCH. MAYBE MORE SO THAN I'VE SEEN IN A LONG LONG TIME. THEN I PRAYED SOME MORE, AND I BROUGHT THIS LITTLE THING OUT THAT YOU CALL BYLAW YOU GAVE TO ME. AND I PRAYED OVER IT, TOO. AND YOU KNOW, I COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES TO SAVE THIS CHURCH AND TO GO ON INTO THE FUTURE, THEN I SAY MY VOTE IS-- [THUNDER ROLLS] YES. - THE VOTE THEN IS 12 YES AND 5 NO. IF I'M CALCULATING CORRECTLY NOW, AND I KNOW I AM, THE VOTE IS 70.58%. THE SUPER MAJORITY IS BACK. - YES! - MOTION TO ADJOURN. - SECOND! - CONSIDER THIS A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT. I QUIT! - COME ON. WE'VE GOT A FIND A NEW PLACE FOR ME TO PLAY. - OKAY. [MUSIC] - I DIDN'T KNOW HOW LAST NIGHT WAS GOING TO GO AT ALL. I CAN'T IMAGINE IT GOING ANY BETTER THAN THAT. - I'M SORRY. - NO. I'M SORRY, TOO. - WE DID IT, MAN! - NO. GOD DID IT. - YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. - HEY, BUT HE DIDN'T MIND US HELPING A LITTLE, DID HE? - NO, HE DIDN'T. HMM. YOU GUYS GO AHEAD. I'LL CATCH YOU. I GOT TO LOCK UP AND TURN THE LIGHTS OUT. - ALL RIGHT. - SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. [THUNDER ROLLS] [NOISE AT THE PODIUM] - VINCENT? - I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU, REVEREND. EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING, YOU HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I TOLD YOU THIS WAS A SPIRITUAL BATTLE. I KNOW NOW I CAN'T LET EVIL WIN. NOT EVEN BY A MAJORITY VOTE. [COCKS GUN] - WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, GET OUT OF THIS AND GET HELP. PUT THAT DOWN, VINCE. YOU'RE STRESSED OUT. LET ME HELP YOU. - WHAT PARTNERSHIP COULD LIGHT HAVE WITH DARKNESS? [THUNDER ROLLS] - GIVE ME THAT. WHAT DO YOU WANT, VINCENT? - YOU COME IN HERE HURTING MY FRIENDS, HURTING MY FAMILY. HOW DOES IT FEEL, PASTOR? HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SACRIFICE MY DAUGHTER ON THE ALTAR OF YOUR GREATNESS? DID YOU FEEL AS RIGHTEOUS WHEN YOUR FAMILY WAS THE TARGET? - WAS IT YOU? DRIVING THE CAR? MY KIDS. WHAT ABOUT WALT? - I MUST CAST THE UNCLEAN THING OUT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. I COULD SAVE THIS CHURCH. I CAN. AND YOU WON'T HURT ANYONE EVER AGAIN. - AH! [GUN FIRES] [MUSIC] - NOW, WHY WOULD YOU RUN UP HERE? [MUSIC] SO I FIGURED YOU SNUCK OUT SOMEHOW, RIGHT? - IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS, VINCENT. THIS ISN'T FAITH. IT'S FORCE.
