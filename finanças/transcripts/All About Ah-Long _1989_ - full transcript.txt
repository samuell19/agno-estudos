TU SHU COMPANY WATER AND ELECTRICITY COMPANY MASSAGE CENTER TU SHU COMPANY Hit him, Dad! What's wrong with you? Look at this mess! -Porky, get up! -What time is it? It's 7:40. -Hurry up and get changed. -No! I'm late again! You're late every time! What have you eaten? Your shit stinks. No more than yours! Hurry. All right! What are you doing? Looking for my bag! I have it. Why didn't you tell me? What's the empty bottle for? I want to get some tea. Why must you always make such a fuss? Jeez! Stopping like that! -Something's burning! -Is it my rice dumpling? Here. Stop honking! I'm moving! Tell your teacher I had a flat tire. I said that yesterday! You ate yesterday. You still need to eat today. Wait! -Porky, you're only two minutes late. -The helmet! Hurry! SPORTS DAY PARENTS ARE WELCOME PRIMARY SCHOOL The program is sponsored by Kwan Kin Travel. Kwan Kin Travel gives you no trouble... Technophone, your mobile phone around the world. Got paid yet? Same old shit. Is Lung still here? Upstairs. Thanks. Thanks. I'm a few hundred dollars short again! What do you mean "short"? You were absent for two days. You were late almost every day. I took my son to the doctor. So? You still have to come to work. I fixed your car in my spare time. You volunteered. I didn't ask for it. If you want more-- Say no more! How else would you learn? Don't be so cocky if you need money. Porky! You will have to start paying for the ride! -Go to hell! -What did you say? Thanks, Tiger! Hey, Dad! No detention today? Dad! -Porky's here! Take a bath! -Damn you, Blackie! Come back! Hey! That's enough! Stop messing around and order your lunch. What would you like? Whatever! Two orders of "whatever." Come back, Blackie! -Come back! -Get off my case! -I'll strip your pants! -Porky! Eat your lunch! Long, telephone! I'm waiting for you. Come! Wah, you still owe me money. -I know. -I need the money! Don't gamble it away! Knock on wood! -Who is it? -Where's Porky? Getting a beating! Put me down and we're even! Watch it, you big bully! He's wanted in a commercial. Commercial? Need him to ride a BMX. What's the deal? He needs to audition for a kids fashion commercial. Can we talk now? Not now. I'm off tomorrow, we will talk then. I'll see you tomorrow! Bye! I'll get even with you, Blackie! How about a cold beer, Dad? Thanks. This is yours. Deluxe set with two eggs. What's the matter? Are you in a bad mood? Did Lung give you a hard time? You must study hard. Get a proper education. So I can be like Lung? So you won't be like me. I wasted my time doing nothing. You will end up in a construction site. I wanted to put you in a good school and get you a better house, but I can't. But you had a great time. I just didn't tell you the downside. Don't worry, Dad! I'll make lots of money. You won't have to work here anymore. What will you do with the money? I'm not telling you. You said you wanted to go to Disneyland. I can go anytime if I have money! When I make enough money, I'll buy you a big house and take you around the world. You're dreaming! Just want to cheer you up! If you're happy, just say it. We will both be happy. Don't spit, or I'll hit you. Brat. -Better run! -I dare you to stay! -No way! -I've got you in the butt! Right in the butt! -Come on! Try again! -Come back! Bull's eye! Only a fool will stay! Bull's eye! Don't shake the truck! You know I have to. How else can I empty the dump truck? KWAN KIN TRAVEL Keung, wake up! You're always like that! Oh, no. Look at that. These new bikers are useless. Don't you start! Hey. You should go back in the track. Remember Macau Grand Prix ten years ago? We haven't won any races since! They come in last every time! Look at my hand and see how I stretch now. Take a look. I have screws up and down my leg. I can't compete anymore. You just don't want to try. Forget it. I'm leaving. Porky! Wait for me after school tomorrow. Don't go anywhere. I'll pick you up. New girlfriend, Dragon? Mind your own business. -Think about it! -We will see! Remember, no detention! Time to eat! I'm hungry! Eat! All you do is eat! We just had lunch, remember? Do you care about anything else? You're all alike. I'm not just a meal ticket. What's wrong with you? This is not an amusement park! You're wasting my time! Porky, this bike costs 1,000 dollars. Do well at the audition, all right? Have I ever let you down? Either you do it or you don't. -Or else you-- -Make a bang, right? You're always so cocky! Hey. I'll race you! All right! You're cheating! Pay attention! Block him! Don't let him pass! Don't be so cocky, kid! What's this? Good! That one is quite good! That's... Yeung Yuet Por. He's quite a rider! He came with the guy with the crew cut. Block him! Dragon! Hey! Is that you? I saw you, but I wasn't sure. So I didn't say hello. Do I look that old? No! I wasn't sure after eight years. Ten actually. Yes, it has been ten years! When did you move back? I didn't. I'm here to shoot a commercial. I'll go back to the US afterwards. You've been living in the US? Yes. What should I call you now? Ms. Poon or Mrs. Something? Ms. Poon will do! Have you met up with any old friends? There aren't any left! Is that your son? No! No such luck! He's a friend's son. -Hey! -Flirting again, Dragon? Damn you. He's a brat. He's adorable. Have a seat. -But you have to work. -Don't worry. Come. Peter, -where's my card? -Porky! Come here! Coming! Here's my card! Say hello. Hello! Yeung Yuet Por, right? You're an excellent rider. Only because they suck! Be modest, kid. Do you want to be in this commercial? Why else would I be here? -Peter, make an appointment for me. -Say thank you! Better? There's not much of a difference. This leg is more or less the same. This wound is as old as Porky. Look at you! Use a rag! He's so cocksure of himself! I know that! Smartass. Hey. Can you sign the contract for me? They need a parent to sign. That's either a father or a mother. Then let his mother sign it. Dinner's ready! Getting a contract is no big deal. I'll make money! Are you sure you can do this? Why else do they want me? -He takes after me! -Take after me indeed! Do you think he will be a star? We will see. Let's see. The interior must cost a fortune! For sure! It's a big business! -Porky! Stop fooling around! -Porky! Please! Don't embarrass me, all right? Are you itchy for another beating? Is the shot ready? Yes! -Remember safety comes first. -Be smart! We can use these. The kid's father is here. Show him in. -Oh, none! -None. It's your show, Peter. I won't let you down. -No problem. -Thanks. Excuse me. Por Por! You two will talk about the contract. I'm bringing Porky to the toilet! I don't need to go! You will when you get there! -Why must I come with you? -Just come! -Are you afraid of a ghost? -Right. I am. Yes! Go by yourself! Have a seat, Mr. Yeung. Your son is adorable. We all like him. Thanks. After the audition, we think he's perfect for the role. Shooting will take two to three weeks. We will try not to disrupt his studies. What do you think? How long... have you been back? You've changed. The contract is ready. His pay is twenty thousand dollars. What do you think? We haven't seen each other for ten years. Por Por, I've always wanted to know-- Please don't call me that. Ms. Poon or Sylvia will do. KWAN KIN TRAVEL You know I can't read English. You can ask someone to help you. Sure. I'll ask my lawyer to take a look. When can you give me an answer? I can't tell. It's tough being a single father. Sylvia! -Do you like the flowers? -I do. -Here. -Thanks. Give me a kiss. It took me a long time to find this. I picked them myself. How about dinner tonight? I'm going over the contract with Mr. Yeung. We want his son for the commercial. What do you think of the contract? No problem. The pay is good. I can sign now. You don't need to study it some more? No, I've read it! Pardon me, you sign here. I know that. Hey. What's the matter? -Hey! -Wait up! -Hey! -Hurry! What did you talk about? Hey. Tell me. What were you thinking? Why didn't you tell me she's back? What's the difference? You will meet her anyway. I feel stupid! Stop it, Porky! "G" You're both my friends. You haven't seen each other for years. I just want to surprise you. How can you blame me? Thanks for nothing. You know what she said to me? She kept calling me Mr. Yeung. She told me not to call her Por Por again! Who does she think she is? I won't be in this jam if not for you! Dad! Hubby! Honey! Stop complaining! Hubby! Coming. I'm hungry. I'm still full! You never have enough! All you do is eat! Tell me, Dad! If you don't like it, I don't have to take this job! Come on! This is for you! Not me. It's from my dad! Thank you. He said, "Happy birthday." How stupid! If you hang around those hoodlums, don't ever come back! Don't cry, Por Por! Look what I got you! Try it on! Ah Long. What's wrong? Move! Move! How dare you hit me! I'll hit you back! Damn! I'll kill you! I bring home money and you hit me! If you want to go, I'll show you out! Is this all right, Sylvia? Are you okay? Is it okay? Well? It's fine! Set off the balloons in the back! Set them off. -Ready? Camera! -Ready. Move towards the kid. One, two, three, action! I'm fine. Are you all right? -Yes. -Can we do another take? I think so. The cameraman said it's getting dark. Shall we call it a day? -Yes, we will continue tomorrow. -All right. That's all for today, folks! -Wonderful! -Off we go. Dad, I'll go change! -Hurry! -Pack up! You don't have to pick him up. We can give him a ride. I'm used to it all these years. I feel better that way. Watch out! -Develop the negatives. -No problem. -You can take down the platform. -Take it down! Peter, order five more bikes tomorrow. It's not in use. Dad, we can go! Bye, Porky! Bye, Sylvia! I'll be rich after this commercial! We can eat out once I get paid. We will have seafood every night! If your mom comes back, she will cook for us! You used to say women are nuisances. Stepmothers are usually abusive. I'm talking about your real mother. She won't beat you. What real mother? Does she exist? You told me my mother is dead. I was just kidding. All these years, have I taken you to her grave? Have I? Do Do, have you eaten? You came for Do Do again? Someone has chosen Do Do. What's so good about that dog? Don't look so sad. Let's go! Bye, Do Do. Watch out! Let's go! How much is the puppy? Forty dollars each. That's such a deal! Chinese should have Chinese dogs. A Shar-pei is a foreign dog. But she said Shar-peis are Chinese! Have you read those tabloids? Lowell Lo's Shar-pei died from diarrhea. Hey, kid! Forget it. You made such a mess and told me to forget it. Why the long face, Porky! Nothing! You can buy a Shar-pei when you have money. I want to buy you a car. If you give me less trouble, I would be eternally grateful! I didn't... Dad! Dad... Your butt stinks! -Don't do this in front of everyone! -Look at your butt! -Old McDonald had a farm -Stop it now! E-I-E-I-O -Come back! -Come on! Come back here! Ah Long. I'm sending him to the orphanage. You decide what to do with him. Por Por is going to the US with me. Overturned? She also told me. She has given up on you and doesn't want to see you again. When you get out of prison, you may do as you please. Nobody will care! Sylvia! A Mr. Ng is here to see you. -Por Por! -Hey! -Have a chat. -Thanks. Thanks. -Sit down. -Yes. -Are those Porky's footage? -Yes. How's it going? Very well. The kid is adorable. What's up? Who's... Porky's mother? You know Ah Long well enough. Ask him yourself. There's nothing I can do. -Don't do that again! -Shut up. Blackie, you should know better. How can you not know the tube is leaky? Get it changed tomorrow. I'm off. I'll fix it tomorrow. Where's Porky? We took him home. Can we talk somewhere? Let me get my jacket. Blackie, I'm leaving. My scooter is over there. My scooter is over there. See you tomorrow! NO ENTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION This place hasn't changed in ten years. You haven't changed either. Really? Our table has been taken. That's all right. No, wait here. Let me talk to them. Sit down. What would you like? The usual. What's that? He's new. -Remember our favorite drink? -No. One jelly ice with two straws. Two jelly ice, please. All right. I can afford that now. Half a dozen chicken and beef satay. One gado-gado. Do you want some fried rice? No, thanks. -That will be all, thanks. -No problem. Do you know why I'm here? Not a clue, Ms. Poon. Whose son is Porky? Mine. I mean who's his mother? Are you kidding me? You don't know? How would I know? You had lots of women back then. You didn't know before, why do you have to know now? Ah Long, I'm serious. Is he my son? So you remember my name. Your memories are finally back? Then you should remember ten years ago, you abandoned your child. Your mother took him to jail to see me, then you disappeared. When I got out two years later, I picked him up from Po Leung Kuk. Now you want to know if he's your son. Are you sure? My mom told me the baby was dead! "Dead." He's invincible. He will have a long life! I didn't know. Or else, I would not have left! That's true, if you had known, you probably wouldn't have left! Can't blame your mother either. You were crazy about me, right? I was young and stupid. I'll forgive you. You can come back anytime. Don't lose your poise. I told them we were a loving couple celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary. That's why we got the table. Say hello! Two jelly ice. Thanks. Isn't this nice? You haven't changed either. You still have a quick temper. Porky takes after you. Luckily he takes after my virtues too. One thing I don't understand. We both have double eyelids. Why isn't he like us? What did you tell him? About what? About me. That you were dead. What should we tell him now? Kids will believe anything. I'll tell him you've become a Christian, and you've been resurrected. Do you think he will buy that? How is the jelly ice? Too sweet. Because you haven't stirred it properly. I have. I bet you haven't taken such a ride in a long time. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. Can I have breakfast with Porky tomorrow? Sure! I would like to come along. I would rather be with him alone. When are you leaving? Not for a while. Good night. Good night. -Por Por! -Sylvia! TUNG FAT WATER AND ELECTRICITY Your outfit costs 200 dollars. I've never worn anything that expensive. Don't spill anything on it, okay? Your mom didn't abandon you. But I broke her heart. You know what she looks like? Yes, she has long hair. She's the director of your commercial. It's stupid going there alone. "Stupid"? She's your mom! Put the photo away. Porky! Hotels don't have soybean milk and dough stick. What should I order? Whatever your mom is having. What shall I say to her? Anything. Just no swearing. -Porky! -I know, whatever she says, I must tell you, right? Zip up your pants. Straighten your shirt! You can't park here, sir. I'm leaving. Where's the restaurant? Over there by the stairs. Hi! Is this the restaurant? Yes. Are you alone? I'm looking for my mom. She's staying at the hotel. Do you know her room number? He's with me. Por. Call me Porky. Have you eaten? Enjoy your meal. Do you like ham and eggs? Help yourself. Porky. You should eat like this. It's just the same! Do you like it? It's for you. I can't accept other people's things. But I'm your mom. Sylvia, we're all set! Shall we go now? No! Cancel today's booking! -It took us a week to get this location. -Let's go, Porky. Come on. We will have to wait for another week! Are you sure? Fine. Get in. Where do you want to go? Wherever. Have you been to Ocean Park? Cable cars, roller coasters, sharks... I've seen them on TV! Do you want to go? Okay. Are you having fun? Yes. What's next? That one! Mom. You shouldn't have taken the ride! I'm all right! I'm all right! TORTOISE JELLY Let's take it together. No. You go ahead. Come on! Ready. Closer. Ready... -Hello? -Dad, it's me! Where have you been? I'm eating instant noodles alone. Instant noodles? Wait! She said to forget it. We're in a French restaurant next to the hotel. She's asking you to come! You can't park here. Here, ten dollars for you. No. Twenty is enough to get front row seats. Make that 30. -Look after my car! -Deal! I'm looking for someone! -Dad! -Porky! Over here! Dad, come here quick! Sit down. What took you so long? I haven't seen you in your party suit. Shut up. That's cute. You have one too. Really? This is for you. -Try it on! Don't be shy! -Thank you. What a kid. It's perfect! Just fit. Now we all have one. Excuse me for a while. Order anything you like. May I have your order? What did you order? I don't know! She ordered for me. I'll have the same. The same? I'll have whatever he's having. Anything to drink? -A beer! -Very well. Hey. What did your mom tell you? Nothing. She didn't talk about me? She didn't. Don't lie to me. Not a word? Really. Not a word. But she gave me a watch. I know I can't accept people's gifts. But she's your mom, dummy. You're the dummy. Look. A diving watch. Did you thank her? Of course. It's alright if it's a gift. -You must never ask for anything, okay? -Yes! Hey, hold on. Do you like her? Do you? Are you making fun of me? -Stop it! -How dare you tease me? I surrender! Nice shirts! Do I get one? Who are you? Patrick! Sylvia. Where have you been? -Let me introduce you. -Why not? -Porky. -Hi. -Mr. Yeung. -We've met. I'm Porky's dad. Patrick is my colleague! Why don't you tell them I'm your boyfriend? You canceled the shoot today. Why didn't you tell me? I was in a hurry. We went to Ocean Park. That's great! Did you have fun with your mom? We rode the roller coaster and the pirate ship. Do you know she's afraid of heights? Yes! She threw up! You threw up? What are they talking about? "Mom"? I'll tell you later. About what? You're kidding. You didn't tell him Porky is your son? What's going on? I'll explain later. Why not tell me now? That's right! Tell him now. You can't talk about your son or your boyfriend. That's so unlike you. Right. Patrick. Porky is my son. When I was pregnant with him, Ah Long... Mr. Yeung dumped me. My mom didn't like him. She told me the baby died at childbirth. So I left for the US. Now I came back and found him. Do I have the right to see him? I don't care about your past. But you shouldn't mix up work and your own business. Even if he's your son, you can't just cancel the booking and take him out to play! Hey, what do you mean? She hasn't seen him in ten years. There's nothing wrong with that. Porky and I have no objection. Don't you have any sympathy? By the way, I never dumped you. You never gave me a chance to explain. And you disappeared without a trace. That's enough. Stop it! Sorry, this is your family matter. Let me excuse myself. Patrick! Are you coming, Sylvia? Ah Long, you've ruined me once. Don't do it again. Porky, I'll come for you tomorrow. Two children's specials. DOCTOR FOR MUSCLE PAIN Porky, your mom is downstairs. Can I go? I never said no. Then I'm going! Be a good boy! I know! -Good morning! -Good morning! Hop in. YAN'S STORE You were born up there. Dad never told me. Because he didn't know. Porky, does having a mom feel strange for you? No. Do you blame me for leaving you? No! Dad said it was his fault. Adults make mistakes. Especially in those days. Your dad and I were so childish. I know, just like me, but I'm always forgiven. Why is there no fish? You must be patient! I'll call you later. -Are you tired? -No! -Let's shop some more then. -Okay. That's what I call a biker. Great! What's the matter with you? Where's your Thai girl? Shopping? Massage? Eating? Shut up! She took all my money and went back to Thailand. Shopping! Why is it you never have a happy ending? The Taiwanese girl ran away last time. You might as well marry one from China. Shut up! I already quit. No? What's going on? I want to stay in shape for the race! I won't force you if you're not interested. What's the point of working together? Do you think Por Por and l will get back together? So that's why. Well, I hope so. But considering your situation. Why bother? Don't ever make mistakes. You will never get a second chance! I just want to get a bigger place so that Porky can live comfortably. Dad! Dragon! Look! -Mom bought me all these. -You're back. These shoes cost 300 dollars. This is so cool! This one is 200 dollars. And 400 dollars each for these! And this one-- Did you say thank you? Many times! Cocky brat. Don't leave them here. -Take them to your room. -All right. -He's been waiting for you. -I know. Do you know there's a booking today? Yes, I do! Why didn't you show up then? You should at least notify the crew. I need to attend to some personal matter. Personal matter? Listen. I don't care what happens. You must wrap this up by next week. Don't worry, you have my word. If you don't believe me, fire me. He won't fire you. SAVINGS: $6003.91 AVAILABLE SAVINGS: $6003.00 SAVINGS: $3.91 AVAILABLE SAVINGS: $3.00 I made a mistake, what should I do? Press "A" and choose "tools." It works. CHINESE CUPID You're here. I made some soup. You must press "MA," look. You can then go back. Yes, press here, like this. Then you can go back. I got it! Have fun. Look what I got you! That's Do Do. I'll see you at Sports Day. Keep an eye on Do Do. You're too much! Por Por. Por Por! Por Por. Don't buy him all these things. I only bought him what he likes. He will be hard to discipline if you spoil him. You bought him so much. I should give you something. I mean, return something. SPORTS DAY What's taking her so long? Maybe she's stuck in traffic. Will she live with us? It will depend on you. There she is! Attention please. This is the final call. Why are you so late? Please report to the reception desk. Hurry, Porky! This is the final call. Hurry! Get up! We will start again. Get up! Wait! We can't win like this! On my cue, one for left leg, two for right leg, get it? -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. We did it! Come on! Come on! No... One, two, three. Let go! You have such friendly eyes I can still remember your face Time has flown quietly by The years have gone by like a dream You wondered alone on The long and winding road Sing, Dad! I've been searching for you I missed your pillow talk at night Such despair to wake up without you Great, I can swim! -Be careful! -Come and swim! Relax. He's smart. Indeed. He's smart and a quick learner. I never worry about his schooling. He never gets in a brawl either. You know why? Why? Because he's their boss. In a way, he's a lot like you. Always popular. All my colleagues are fond of him. Really? I suppose all parents are alike. Their kid is the best. I forgot to bring a camera. We could've taken a picture. I mean a family picture. I'm going back to the US after the shoot. So soon? You should stay. There are many job opportunities here. I can't stay because you want me to, or leave because of you. That's not what I mean. Ever since you came back, Porky has never been happier. If you leave us again, I don't know what to tell him. I'm not leaving him. I'm hoping to... take him with me. He needs a stable life. And he needs his mother. You're saying I didn't take good care of him? Where were you when he cried? -Where were you when he was sick? -Where was I? What did you tell him? You told him I was dead! Why didn't you tell him the truth? He didn't have a mother because of you. I neglected him because of you. When he's sick or sad or happy, I want to be with him. I'm hoping you will let him come with me. I don't know if he will agree. He will. As long as you agree, he will come with me. Dad, come in for a swim! What is this? Are you punishing me? Do you know how much he means to me? He's all I've got! Dad! Jump in! Mom, you too! Come on. Come on! -Come here. -You naughty boy! Splash! Swim! Don't pull my legs! -Your turn! -Splash! Let's go for a swim! Come on! Stop, Mom! Water got in my eye! Did you hear him call me "Mom"? He called me Mom! Do you still hate me? No! I don't hate you! How could I? But I don't love you either! You think you have nothing and Porky is all you have? After I gave birth to him, the doctor said I'll never have another child. Please, let me have him. Mom. Why are you wearing those dirty clothes? Because you didn't do laundry. I have no more clean clothes. Let's eat. I'm not hungry. But you didn't eat anything today. What's the matter with you two? Are you happy with your mom? Yes. Do you like her? Yes! You're a big boy now. You should take care of yourself. I want you to live with your mom. Other kids your age are smart. They know about computers. You can't follow me to the construction sites. That's not what I want to do. I don't want you to be like me. That's why I want you to go with your mom. Can't she live with us? I wish she would. But she won't! You broke her heart, I didn't! You can't kick me around like a ball! I want to stay here! I don't want a stepfather! What did you say? I want to stay here! If you don't like the things she gave me, I'll throw them away! Porky! Porky! Stop it. Porky, stop it, come on. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Don't throw away your things. Stop! I said cut it out! You don't want mom's things. I don't want them either! That's enough. Stop throwing things! You deserve a good beating! I told you to stop! Why don't you ever listen? That hurts! I must teach you a lesson today! It hurts, Dad! Stop! Please stop! If you want me to go, I'll pack up! Remember what you said! Don't ever come back! Give me 20 dollars. Why are you here, Porky? Dad wants me here. Who beat you? He loves me. Did he beat you? I know why he did it. He wants me to come live with you. Mom, he loves you! Dad? It's me! It's Porky. Say something! I miss you! Hey, Dad. Why won't you answer me? Talk to me, Dad! Sorry I woke you up! Good night! Look at this lunch! Patrick. -Why are you so quiet? -Let's have lunch. Do you like hamburger and French fries? No. Here you go. How's the last day of shooting? Fine. I've seen the rushes. Porky is wonderful! He will be a star after this. Do you like Porky? Sure! He's your son! I want to take him to the US. You said you like him. You know I'll never have another baby. Even if that's the case, we can adopt after we get married. Why? Porky is my son. You don't want to give up anything. Is it Porky you don't want to give up or is it Ah Long? Forget it. Get back to work after lunch. I want to go for a walk. You better think this over. Water? Mr. Wong came to say hello. -Boss. -Congratulations! You did a great job! Thanks! Eat something, kid. Why the long face? You look great! Eat a bit more! Where's the superstar? -Where is he? -Over there! You are truly adorable! Superstar! I heard he's your son. We're taking him back to the US. Leave me alone! This is the perfect age to go. He will adapt easily. When are you leaving? As soon as we finish the job, we will leave right away. When are you getting married? You will have to check with Sylvia! Porky, where are you going? I don't want to go to the US. I want my dad. Sylvia! Porky, you're all dressed up! Leave me alone! Where's my dad? Your dad? We haven't seen him for a few days. Where is he? How would I know? Are you mad? Dad! Dad! -Dad! -Porky! You lied! You didn't come to see me! You don't want me anymore? Porky! Dad! Don't cry. Don't leave me again! I promise. Don't cry anymore. Don't cry anymore. Por Por, I'm sorry! I can't let you have him! I was stupid enough to think I can make up for the ten years with you. I envy you. Thanks for letting me spend time with him. Mom, please don't go! Porky, you don't understand. Porky, don't be like this! She will come visit. Will you write to me? Definitely. Por Por. Por Por. Do you know why I named him Porky? Yes, I do! Mom. What's wrong?

You can't go inside the restricted area. I thought you have left! Where's Ah Long? -He's in the starting zone. -Please! -Please let her in. -Thank you. They haven't seen each other in years. Let them have a chat. It will just take a few minutes. I'll account for her. Mom, you're still here! -Porky! -Mom! Mom! DAD, HURRY! LAST LAP Don't worry. He will be all right! Dad, show them.
