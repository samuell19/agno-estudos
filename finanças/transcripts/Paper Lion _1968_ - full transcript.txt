MAN ON PA: Under sponsorship of Sports Illustrated magazine, George Plimpton will pitch to the entire National League and American League All Star lineups. The team which gets the most hits will share a cash prize. MAN ON PA: In black trunks, sports writer, George Plimpton on assignment for Sports Illustrated magazine, will box three rounds with the middle weight champion of the world, the great Sugar Ray Robinson. (INAUDIBLE) WOMAN ON MACHINE: Mr. Plimpton, please call Oscar Barnes at Sports Illustrated. (BEEPS) MAN: George, football game on Sunday. Sheep's Meadow, Central Park. Elevenish. OSCAR: George, Oscar. Have to talk to you. Call me. (BEEPS) WOMAN: George, please call Jeanie at Murray Hill 14654. That's, Jeanie at MU 14654. George, this is Oscar! For God's sake, return your calls. Oscar. This place looks like a disaster area. (CLEARS THROAT) GEORGE: Did you call the printer? Yeah, I told him we'd have the dummy for next month's edition ready first thing in the morning. All right. I want to use the Frank Conroy story. Okay. Arthur's article on NATO. Yeah? The Baldwin interview. Foreign? Bernadette's poem. Which one? This one. Okay. Anything else? Yes. (LAUGHS) Scrub my back. Theron, throw me a shovel pass to the right. Let's go. MAN: Hike. Go! Go! (ALL YELLING) Where the hell were you? You were supposed to be blocking him. Oh, yeah. No, no, George. Six, that's the magic number. That's how many articles you still owe us. I know, I swear I'm thinking every minute. Oh, yeah, more about editing your magazine than writing for mine. Hey, how about sky diving? We could use a piece. You know, how it feels to float from 10,000 feet. Especially on the first jump. No, thank you, Oscar. ALL: Hey, come on, let's go! Come on. Run it stiff. Kate, it's touch football, touch! Two hands below the waist. I know. I just got carried away. All right, let's go, let's play. George, I've got it. Something with a little circus color, see? Like standing up for a knife-thrower. Huh? No. Come on, it's our down! All right, now, now. Ann, you go down about 10 yards and cut into the center. Okay? Oh, listen. Now some guys ride the backs of sharks. They say it's a hell of a thrill. And not too dangerous at all. You just sneak up behind the shark, and grab hold of the dorsal fin. Oscar, you're the left guard. Sure. Sure. MAN: Come on, let's go. Hike! (ALL SHOUTING) Let's go. (CHATTERING) All right, now, listen. Oscar, I think I can beat Kent. Why don't you send the shovel pass to the left, okay? Let's go. Ready? Hike! George, I've got it. Pro football. You're a rookie quarterback trying to make the team. (CROWD CHEERING) Kate, the play is over. I scored. I like tackling you. Oh, yeah? Okay, come on. Now, look. Listen, George. No kidding. There's a lot of interest in pro-ball. It's damn near the national sport. I can see the whole six articles on it. That would get you off the hook with me completely. Come on, Oscar, he'll get bombed. Oh, I don't know about that. He got in the ring with Sugar Ray, didn't he? It's not a guy with gloves. It's 11 with bare knuckles. Yeah, he'd get destroyed. I don't think so. George has a certain amount of natural ability. OSCAR: Right, he pitched to the All Stars, didn't he? ANN: You bet your life he did. What a game that was. Strike! I still say, it's not just a matter of him getting out there by himself and throwing the ball, you know. Yeah, he'd have to learn the plays, he'd have to work out with the team. No club would let him. Well, that's Sports Illustrated's job. And I think we can set it up. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I still think he's gonna get killed. And I've got a grand to back it up! OSCAR: Yeah, well I say he'll do all right. Maybe even damn good, and I've got a grand to back that up. Now, let's go over to my house and have a drink. George? I didn't say anything. Aren't you a little old for stunts? Well, it's better than riding a shark. Personally, I think you ought to have your head examined which should be easy. You'll be holding it in your hands. (LAUGHS) Is that so? Go on out for a pass. No, thank you. I've hung up my cleats. Pro football from the inside, is that what you really want, George? That's the idea, Coach. In other words, you want the fans to get a real good look at the head knocking, the training, et cetera, that goes into the making of a professional football team? That's it and then at the end, I go into a real game and run off a few plays at quarterback. A real game? You've got to be kidding. No, that's what the whole thing is leading to. And you mean to tell me that you went three rounds with Sugar Ray Robinson? Pitched to the All Stars, huh? (CROWD CHEERING) Well, I will say it's an interesting idea. A real interesting idea. But, you know, George, we carry four quarterbacks now, and to ask us to carry five, I think that would be a real headache. I just don't think it will work. Have you tried the AFL? Didn't Mr. Reeves get my letter explaining everything? No. No, no, you see the idea is for me, an amateur, to go through the Rams training camp. It's all explained in my letter. It... Oh, never mind. No. No, no, it's all right. No, thank you very much. Goodbye. Kate, get off a letter to the Colts, the Bears and the Lions. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Thing is I haven't been able to get any club to go along with me yet. I was kind of hoping you'd put in a good word for me with the Giants. I've got a good word for you George. Forget about being quarterback. Just stay out of the pit, George, whatever you do, stay out of the pit. Hiya, honey? Hi. Frank, I appreciate what you're saying, but it has to be quarterback, that's the nerve center of the team. George, you're crazy. Why don't you just forget this whole idea? These guys are big. 6'5", 6'6". 250, 260 pounds. What if they make a mistake? Remember Y.A. Tittle in the Pittsburgh game in 1964? One shot, we missed one block. Zip, he's out for the season. John Baker hit him a shot you would not believe. And I know you saw the Baltimore, L.A. game a couple of years ago. What they did to Johnny Unitas was inhuman. These are well conditioned, professional athletes. They're big. If they make a mistake, something goes wrong and they hit you one time, it is all over. Forget about it, George. Come, George, come dance with me. And, George, if a club does say yes, remember, stay out of the pit. FRANK: Boy, he's off his rocker. George! George! Kate! GEORGE: What? I can't hear you. Kate, what is it? What's what? All the stuff, what is all that? Oh, that. The Detroit Lions. What about them? Oh, we got a call. They said maybe. GEORGE: Well, what do you think? (LAUGHS) I like it. I like the idea. Of course, playing on the team is up to Coach Schmidt. George, there is something about pro-football you have to understand. It's hitting. That's what it's all about. Oh, sure, Coach. I know that. George is very athletic, you know. He mixed it up pretty well with Sugar Ray Robinson. (BELL RINGING) And he also pitched in the All Stars. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Did you ever think about split end instead of quarterback? No, that's the whole idea, Coach. Rookie quarterback trying to make the team. I wouldn't want any special treatment or privileges. I wouldn't even want the players to know I'm a writer. Even have the cover worked out for myself. That I've been playing semipro in Canada. Well, the coaching staff would have to know. Oh, sure, the staff. And of course, the doctor. Okay, but that's all. Look, Coach, if it's not working out, you can always cut me. All right, you have yourself a deal. Thank you, Joe. Thanks a lot. I really appreciate this. I have a few errands to take care of, George. We'll see you in training camp. I hope you're going to be in shape. Okay. See you. Okay, Joe. Oh, George, I have some papers here, I'd like you to sign. Releases for the club in case of mishap. Merely a formality. Listen, have you done anything about insurance? What? Lloyds wouldn't touch it, I asked. I have a friend in Detroit. You can pick up $25,000 in case of death, dismemberment, or loss of sight. Here sign this last page on the bottom. Bill, what do you think of our running back situation? I think that's our strongest point in the whole ball club. I say that especially because of Eddie and Farr coming in, the two top rookies. Karl, you saw a lot of Farr last year. What did he do in the 40 yard dash? KARL: Farr has got real good speed. He ran the 40 yard dash in 4.5. BILL: That's fast enough. JOHN: How about Jim Getzke? How big is he? KARL: He's 6'1", 195. JOHN: What school did he go to? He's a free agent from Santa Barbara College in California. JOE: How about Tim Jones? He has a chance at quarterback, Joe. But, I still think it'll be between Sweetan and Plum. Hey, speaking of quarterbacks, here comes your last string quarterback now. JOE: Put him on the chart, Bill. Plimpton. BILL: Yeah, this ought to do, Super Bowl team. Dorm's right through that door. Across the lawn. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Go! Gee, man, you must play with Roger Brown. He'll make mince meat out of you, baby. Hi. How are you doin'? My name is Plimpton. George. Oh, yeah! What position do you play? Quarterback! I'm trying out for quarterback. Oh, yeah, man, everybody loves a quarterback. Call my number, baby, so I can shine. You know Roger Brown, he's human like everybody else. MAN: They're all so big I'm not sure any of them are human. You know, we had a guy that weighed 320 pounds in college? He needed two chairs to sit on. Uncoordinated. Yeah, he couldn't chew bubble gum and walk at the same time. Over here, George. This side is for vets. (CHATTERING) You're kind of old to be a rookie, aren't you? I've been playing semipro ball. Semipro? Who did you play with? The Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Newfs. The Newfs? Newfs! Newfs? What's a Newf, man? It sounds like a bug to me. I don't know. (LAUGHING) Here you are! MAN 1:You can't say a thing about my game, Roger. MAN 2: I've heard all about it. That big guy with the red shirt on. Huh? That's Roger Brown. He sure is big, isn't he? Yeah. Sometimes I play golf. Hey, Roge, is that all you gonna eat? They fine me $10 for every pound over 300. Man, this is all my appetite can afford. Don't worry, Roge. They'll give you a choice. They'll either bleed you or fine you. Sure, Roge, you eat anything you damn please. Just don't swallow. You've done a lot of things, right? But Eva Braun was a woman, how come you got... That was a woman, baby. I looked good, though. The ugliest woman I ever saw. Are you kidding? I looked great. I had blonde hair, big charlies. And I have leather boots all the way up to my... (ALL LAUGHING) That's Alex Karras over there. Hey, Alex, tell us about Hitler. You two are quite a pair. That was a front, I'll tell you something. You really wanna know about Hitler? He was a broad. What? Broad. (ALL LAUGHING) No, I'm not kidding. Do you know who he really was? He was my mother-in-law from Clinton. Excuse me. Hey, rook, up on a chair. Your hand over your heart, let's hear it for your Alma Mater. Alma Mater. * Fight on tonight, boys, fight on to win * Fight on tonight, boys, fight on to win * You do your best now, we'll do the rest * I'll fight on for victory Yeah, yeah. You're next. * Zumba, zumba, zumba * I ziggy zumba, zumba, zay * I ziggy zumba, zumba, zumba, I ziggy zumba, zumba, zay * Roll along, you BG warriors * Roll along and fight for BGSU * Yeah! No, I hear you, Kevin. * Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame Oh, here comes my bonus, baby. Half a million dollars for that kind of singing. (BOOING) You kidding me? Sit down! It's funny, he can't sing. * Notre Dame will win over all * While her loyal sons are marching onward to victory * Take your truck and go home! (PEOPLE BOOING) Spend some of that money on singing lessons. * Hail to the Victors valiant * And hail to the conquering heroes * Hail! Hail! To Michigan Not Frank Sinatra but... What are you saying? * Go, you North Western * Break right through that line * With the colors flying, we will tear you all apart * Rah, rah, rah Great, he got great feeling, this guy. He plays better than he sings. (LAUGHING) * Crimson in triumph flashing * Through the blue obscurity * We'll fight for the name of Harvard Harvard? * Till that last white line is past * White line. That's horrible! Who's that guy? Some rookie quarterback from Harvard. From Harvard? I didn't know the guy was from Harvard. You didn't play football there? How many rookies do you think will make it this year? None of 'em. (ALL LAUGHING) First rule I'd like to talk about governs the play book. Now, a lot of time and effort in the off season has gone into compiling the information in this book. A lot of classified information. It doesn't belong to anyone else but the Detroit Lions. So if you lose a book, it's $500. All right. Meetings. Everybody is to be on time for your meetings. If you're not on time, it results in a $50 fine. Plus a dollar a minute. All right, if you're late for a practice, that's $100. All right, if you miss a practice, that is $200. Now if you're late for a meal, that's $25. If you miss, it's $50. Transportation, $200 bucks, if you miss a plane. If you're late for a bus, it's $100. All right, curfew will be at 11:00. Lights out at 12. Now, when I say 11:00, I want you in your room, not in the john, and not in the hall, milling around with the rest of the ball players. But in your room. Now, if you're not in your room, you'll be marked absent. Now that's $200 right there. If I catch you with any women in the dormitory or in your room, that's a $500 fine. $500. So she'd better be worth it. (ALL LAUGHING) All right, a few words to you rookies. A little advice. You're here for one reason, to make this ball club. Everything you do should go to that end. On the 29th, that's our first big scrimmage. And right after that, we have a cut. Starting to get down to our 40-man roster. So you better be on your toes every time you step on that football field. How do you feel, Mike? I guess all right. That's good. That's you. How about a hand, Ernie? There you go. Are you okay, Ernie? Fine, Friday. Nick, all right? Fine, Friday. You still wear 40 long, Roger? Right, Friday. There you are. (MEN CHATTERING) How's the knee, Mickey? Real great! Good, baby, good. What's the matter? My ears are folded under. There, is that better? I think I'm stuck in here. You'll get used to it. Feels like I'm talking in a cave. George! It goes on the other way around. (CHATTERING) All right, let's start out with a good workout. All right, let's go, side straddle. Beginning! ALL: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. On your backs, now. Stretch those legs there. All right, now, we're going to make men out of you guys. Stretch it back, stretch it back. Down! Left leg up. Stretch it way back. Down! Right leg up! Right leg up and stretch it back. Down! Left leg up. Yeah! All right, on your stomachs. Rock and roll position. Rock and roll. Rock and roll. Rock and roll. There we go, rock and roll (ALL GRUNTING) All right, push up position. All right, let it up. Push ups! Push ups now. Down! Up! Down! Up, down, up, down, up, down! Up, down, up, down! Everybody up. Up and running. Up and running. Hit the deck. Up! Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! Up! Up and ready! Down! Up! Down! Up and running. Down! Up and running. Down! Hey, Alex. Yeah. Come here. See that skinny guy up there? Yeah. Well, he's here on special assignment from Sports Illustrated. He's going to write an article, something to do with pro-football. I didn't think you'd give a draft choice up for him, Coach. Well, keep it quiet, but just keep an eye on him, will you? Yeah, I will. Okay. COACH: Every block, every block, every block! Higher, higher! Okay, but six weeks of this. MAN 1: Come on, sorry about that. MAN 2: All right. COACH: Nice there, nice. Faster, pick 'em up. Higher, both feet. Take your time. Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, that's it. Every other one. Every other one. Every other one, come on. A good one. That's a good one. (ALL GRUNTING) MAN 3: That's right, baby. You're getting light, now, ain't you? Take your time. Ready, go! (CHATTERING) Come on, come on. Come on, Charlie! Move the train. Come on, Charlie! Five point three. Charlie Bradshaw, five point four. COACH: Go! PLAYER: Let's go. Come on. Jerry Rush, five point three. Roger Brown, five three. COACH: Go. Sweetan ran a, let's see, five two. Plimpton, five point eight. Man, that's just what we need. A quarterback that runs like the front end of a giraffe. Let's see you work on that opponent. All right, turn around. Come on. All right. Drive good. Come on now. Good work, watch it. All right. Right. Hit it hard. Hit it right, come on. Hit it! Hike! Hike! Two, ready, go! Everybody in. How do you feel, pal? Oh, great! Great! That's good, 'cause Joe's real easy the first day. TWEETY: Walton. 246. Good shape, Charlie. Barney. All right! 190. Karras! (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (IMITATING PIG GRUNTING) 267. Always in great shape. Nice shape. Gordy. MAN: Take off your raccoon coat, John, you'll lose 10 pounds. 250. MAN: What a big bear. Shoals. There goes Shoalkey. Beach ball with arms. 275. Plimpton. BARNEY: Mr. Harvard. LUCCI: He's not from Harvard, he's a Newf from Newfoundland. 175. George, my boy, you're really in trouble. (ALL LAUGHING) Roger Brown. Take him to the stock yard. 305. 305, Roger, huh? That's five pounds over 50 bucks, my boy. Fifty bucks? That's right. How's your knee? It's okay. All right, buddy, at the end of training camp, I want you down to 285. Four, six, three, 80. Hike, hike! MAN 1: I got it! Hike, hike! Now, we're moving. Now, we're moving. Ninety! Hut, hut, hut! MAN 1: All right, come on, cone on, let's get back. And get sling here. MAN 2: Let's go, let's go. Right, Plimpton, you're up. Let's have a huddle, let's go! All right, Plimpton, here's your play. Opposite right. Brown, left. X in nine center on two. COACH: Ready. ALL: Hike! Opposite left! BILL: All right, don't be bashful, George, get your hands in there. Snap it up hard! MAN 1: Get your hands in there. COACH: Now, come on, come on, come on, come on! Four, six! Three, 88. Hut! (GROANS) What's that? I don't know. One of Joe's ideas. MAN 3: Opposite left. Left! Opposite left! Five, six, three. Eighty-eight. Hut! MAN 1: Pick him up. Pick him up. What the hell's going on? That's all for today, Plimpton. He's got it all right. Super rook written all over him. COACH: All right, give me another huddle. Hey, rook, want a tip? Pro ball has got a certain feel about it. If I were you I'd hold on to one all the time until I got the hang of it. Oh, thank you, Karl. You bet, buddy. Hiya! MAN: How you doing, buddy? Hiya, rook. Hut! Hut! Hiya, rook. Alex, look at this. That's blood, Alex, that's real blood. I guess the guys just didn't want to waste a good nose blood, buddy. Hey, pal, let me tell you something. These guys are on to you. Now, you just can't come down the field like you're comin' down a field, screwin' around and expect these guys to believe it. Oh, look, Sugar Ray, huh? You want to know somethin'? This mixing amateur with pro, man, it's nothin'. You're trying to tell the guys that a guy from Park Avenue could come down here and make our ball club like it's nothin'. No, Alex, it's a job. That's all, I'm doing a job. Hey, George, I read your baseball book. It wasn't that much. I mean, you give some guys some bread, go throw a few balls, they take a few swings and that's that. And your Sugar Ray thing, you go out, you get flattened. Hey, I give you a lot of credit for going in the ring with him. He flattened you. You're by yourself. George, this is a team effort. Everybody has to know what everybody else is doin'. Or somebody can get hurt. I've had a good life in pro football. I'd like to keep it that way. I don't want to be messin' around with somebody like you and get hurt. Like a ligament. Ligaments don't heal, George. Well, what I'm trying to say to you is this, why should I play for you? So you can get some kicks? I've got to lay it on the line. If I were you, pal, I'd start thinking about packing up. Contact work starts tomorrow. COACH: Come on, Al, come on now. Take him on. Get him! Make your move, make your move. Get him out, get him out. Take him out, keep movin'. Let it go. (GRUNTING) (ALL SHOUTING) COACH: Come on, Billy. Come on, here. Save it, save it. Come on, Ernie. Let's go, Bill. All right, you two are up, let's get after it now. Well, George, now that they're onto you, what are you going to do? What I came to do. To see and to do. Well, you'd better take care of yourself. (WHISTLES) COACH: All right, let's go live. (CLAPPING) (ALL YELLING) MAN: One, ninety. Hut, hut. Keep coming. Hey, hey, no go. COACH: All right, that's the way to get them. COACH: Track back, Ernie. Okay, I got it, Beav. Fifty. You okay, Mick? Yeah, I'm okay, Coach. Sure? Yeah, I'm okay. All right, take a little rest. Hey, George, you're up! Let's have a huddle now, come on. Come on, now, George. Get back. Here we go, split right, white and left. Eight post on two, that's a pass. Ready? Break. Okay, baby, short and sweet. PLAYER 1: Here we go, George. Smile, baby. Three, 88. Hey, Newfy! PLAYER 2: Hey, Newf? COACH: Get in there, now, come on. Come on. MAN 1: Come on, get him. ALL: Come on, George. All right, opposite right, 34 on two. That's a hand-off to your fullback, get around quick so you don't miss it. Ready, break. Now, let's break the huddle and get out there. MAN 2: Okay, let's go, rookie. MAN 3: Come on, George. MAN 4: Come on, throw one, baby. MAN 5: Come on, check. Three, 88. MAN 6: Come on, baby. Hut! Come on, come on. COACH: Come on, up, up. All right, George, that's enough for today. You've had a big day. No, you keep it and go practice taking some snaps. He laid you down, now we just got to start all over again. MAN 7: Four! All right, now, pop it in there, make those hands bleed. Four, six, three, 25. Hut! Hut! Hut! Go, go, go. Put it on there. Go for 20. Go for 30. Go, go. Wait, come back. Come back with the ball. The ball. Lights out. (SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) It's Lucci... I know it's you, Lucci. I'll get you, I'll get you. Lucci! Lucci. Lucci! I know it's you. (YELLING) (ALL SCREAMING) GEORGE: I'll get one of you. MAN 1: Hut! Hut! MAN 2: Way out! Way out. COACH: Let's go, rookie. Way to hand it off. Set, hut! MAN 3: Come on, let's go. Let's go Mickey Mouse. Now, let's play out your pass. All right. Don't get lazy back there. Set, hut! MAN 3: Now put her here, put her here. Set, hut! Set, hut! (ALL CHEERING) MAN 4: Good pass, good pass. Set, hut! Hey, you know that Newf is getting better. Yeah, but not much. This ought to slow George down a little tomorrow. GEORGE: My feet feel kind of heavy. MAN: Hey, fellas, George got himself a case of heavy feet. They're muscle spasms, Georgie. ALL: Break! ALL: Open, open, open, open! Three, 39. Hut, hut! (PLAYERS GRUNTING) Hut! Let's go! Hut! Hut! (CHATTERING) COACH 1: Come on, George! COACH 2: Keep goin', George. Hey, Newf, are you cryin'? PLAYER 1: Come on, come on! PLAYER 2: Man, he sure does move good, don't he? PLAYER 3: Keep it up. See you on the field tomorrow, George? Oh, sure, I wouldn't miss it for anything. I'll have Tweety shoot me full of Novocain. George, this ought to cure your heavy feet for you. (ALL LAUGHING) Look at that. I guess that'll give you heavy feet, won't it? Hey, George, if you need any help, you know, in technique or something? Thanks, Karl. Oh, what the hell, we quarterbacks have to stick together, right? Right. Hiya, George. How do you feel? Fine. That's good. Do you still want to play in a real scrimmage? Well, I want you to drop by and see Coach McPeak. And he'll give you four or five plays. Okay? All right. Good boy! GEORGE: Then I would start with a 45 blue lead. BILL: Right. Okay. Then the next thing I'll do is come back with a 19 keeper, right? Now, what about the pass plays? With your first pass you go split left, green left. Come back. That'll be against Erasmus. Well, I've noticed in practice I've been passing better to my right. Listen, what about a long one? What about a bomb? No, they'd never expect a bomb from me. I think I could beat the Beaver long on the next corner. I mean, if my protection holds up. KATE: Oscar, you heard from George yet? OSCAR: No. Not a word. I think he's been swallowed up. He hasn't even wired you for money yet. Does that sound like George? Oh, that's all right, I understand. As a matter of fact, I don't mind not sending George money. Well, what about pictures? No. I don't think so. Well, don't you need an outline for the article, or, you know, something? No. No, George can handle this. He'll do just fine. Well, I was just trying to be helpful, you know. Well, now. Wait a minute. Listen. I've got an idea that maybe... No, no. I don't suppose that you'd want to go to Detroit and see what was going on. Oh, no. You know... George would think... Yeah, that's what I thought. Still, if I could help you... Yeah, that's what I thought, too. Well, if you insist. I'll go. Me, me, me, me. COACH: Come on, Tommy, take a lap. Me, me, me, me. George! Hold it! (CHUCKLES) Kate. Hi. Oscar wanted some pictures. What? Pictures. You know, pictures for your articles. So he sent me. I told him, "Look, you want a real pro." You don't want me down here. I certainly didn't want to come. Oh. Hey, look at that gal with George. Beautiful. Hey, John, call a play that way. JOHN: All right, spilt right. 49 EGO on two, ready? ALL: Ready! JOHN: Let's go. You okay? You broken or anything like that? It's Oscar, he's very worried about his writers. MAN 1: Hey, George! MAN 2: Yeah, George. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Let's go. Let's get back in that huddle. I'm at the Kingsley Inn. Beautiful suite. Look, Kate. You can't hang around here. I'll have to go now, you have a good trip back. Thanks a lot. All right. Forty-three outside split, right. What's your assignment? Eye to eye on the guard. Four, three over opposite left. Nose to nose on the center. Four, three under split, left. Ear to ear on guard. Good. Twenty blitz. Shoot the gap. Well, it was never like this in college. Forty blitz. George, what do you say we hit the town tonight? No, I can't... Hey, George. What do you say you and I make the scene tonight? Little night life. I was here first. Well, let me tag along with you guys. All right, let's go. No. No, wait a minute. I can't go out tonight. Sure you can go. I have to work on the play book tonight. Well, you should work on the play book, George. You're gonna be a great athlete. Not too much work, though, George. Okay, you finks, so we don't get into any trouble tonight. Georgie, you put this Lion blazer on, baby. Look, I'm not going out. George. What hotel you say she was stayin' at? I didn't. Oh, but you will, George. You will. No, fellows. Hey, wait a minute. Oh, yes. Hey, no, wait a minute. Would you wait a minute? Now, listen, I'm not going out, so you'd better put me down. I'm not going. I'm not going out tonight! (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, come on, Plimpton, let me dance awhile. Okay. I'm telling you, John, this is a hell of a chance for us, baby. Look at this thing, isn't it beautiful? It feels good, Alex. It's from Germany, feel how heavy it is. I'm telling you, it feels good. All right? Does it have any attachments? I don't know about attachments but, John, let me tell you something. We can get the franchise for the whole United States. You know what that means? It means that we could sell a hundred, thousand of these, and we could make a million bucks. A million. How much does a franchise cost? I don't know, but let's call Pete Largo. Call him right now. Yeah. Last year it was the Gordy burger. The year before, sauna baths. The only body that took a bath was Alex and John. That's very good. Hey, George, you got an apartment in New York, beautiful pad. A ready list as long as your arm. What the hell are you doing here? It's my job. Your job, huh? Look, I got an idea. Instead of you coming here for the summer let me come to New York. I'm gonna get another pitcher of beer. May I have another pitcher of beer please? Lion, eh? Yes. Where do you figure to finish this year? Oh, we'll go all the way. Yeah, all the way down. No. I don't know about that. We have a lot of mean looking animals out there. Bodies, Mac. That's what you got out there, bodies. Oh, really? You want to see some animals? You come to Chicago, it's the home of the Chicago Bears. There you'll see animals. That's wonderful. What do you play? What does he play? He plays towel collector, that's what he plays. Now, just a minute I don't think you have to be so rude. Rude? Isn't that a sweet word, rude? Listen, I'm not interested in being exposed to your antediluvian aggressiveness. What did you say? Are you some kind of expert on football from Chicago? Let me tell you something, Charlie, another word out of you and I'm gonna knock you right on your keyster. With what? With these. Oh, I'd like to see that. Apologize, George. Apologize for what, damn it, I didn't do anything. George, you're swearing. I don't care. He was badmouthing the club. He apologizes, okay? I don't apologize for anything. Hey, George, got something for you. A jersey for this afternoon's scrimmage. JOE: Let's have it quiet. And give me your attention. Now today's scrimmage, we're gonna try to play everybody we can. I know you don't enjoy hitting against your own ball players, but we have to get this work in. I want 100 percent from everybody. You know if we go 100 percent, we don't have the injuries. Now, it's gonna be a 60-minute scrimmage. I want 60 minutes of all out football. Eye train will be shooting the film. Now, another thing, first opportunity coaching staff has to see some of you rookies under game conditions. And you know, immediately after a scrimmage, there is a cut. So you'd better play accordingly. All right, Plimpton, you run the first series. It's time I get an opportunity to see my last string quarterback under fire. (ALL LAUGHING) You know your plays? I have them written on my wrist, Coach. A bit of warning, stay away from that quarterback sneak. It gets mighty tough up that middle. Now, any questions? No questions, let's go on that field. Let's go! (CHATTERING) Don't give anything away, George. Watch your eyes. Not me, Ron. They'll be shut tight. Confidence, kid. Split right, 45 blue lead. Ready? Four, set! Four, 26. Hut. Hut! (ALL SHOUTING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) Okay, that was a good run. Good call, George. Hey, now you're taking charge. Let's go. Let's go have a huddle! Come on, huddle. Split left, 19, keeper. (WHISTLE BLOWING) PLAYER: Let's play. Four, set! Thirty-three. Hut. Hut. Hut. (ALL SHOUTING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) Who's that? Plimpton, George. Where's he from? I don't know. Harvard. MAN: Hey, that's not a bad call. Twelve yards! I made us a first down. Great change up, George. Okay, come on, let's go! Let's go. Opposite right, brown left. Fan X and nine center. Brown's a pass, George. I know it's a pass. Then get it to me. I'll get it to you, baby. You just hang, on. Yes, sir. On three. Ready? George, you're marvelous! Nice going, Georgie. Four, six! Thirty-three. Hut! Hut! Great! Good pass, George. Go! (WHISTLE BLOWS) We did it. That's the way, pal. That was great, George, that's threading the needle. Okay, let's go. Come on, come on. Come on. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Split right. Fake eleven pass. Wait a minute, George, that's up the middle. Who's calling the plays? Okay. It's your problem. On one. Ready? GEORGE: Four, six! Three! Thirty-two! Hut! (ALL CHEERING) Nice going, rookie. Really, it was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. JOE: Go take a shower. Thank you. Hey, George, how come you have a zero on your shirt? MAN: Nice going, George. George! Kate! Come here. Kate! Did you see that? Did I see it? Did you see that? You were fantastic? I was very hot. You were great. And I've got pictures to prove it. Now, aren't you glad I came? Yes, yes. You know, I couldn't do anything wrong. I mean, there are days like that. You know, every ball player hits his streak. And you just have to ride it. Play it out. What are you laughing at, chink? Oh, nothing, George. MAN 1: You're beautiful. George, you're beautiful. MAN 2: Fantastic run, George. MAN 3: You were light-footed. All right, let's play football. I've been had, huh? Just a little, man. George. All right, look. My deal with Oscar was to get in the game and write some articles about my experiences. That's all. I never said they'd take me seriously as a player, did I? No. Rookie show's tonight. I'll cover that. Tomorrow, we'll go back to New York. Okay. I'm going to shower and get dressed. Can I scrub your back? George. There's always next week. Next week? The Saint Louis Cardinals. (HULA MUSIC PLAYING) (MAN WHISTLING) (ALL LAUGHING) All right, now, before we go any further. I thought we should take first things first. And in that order, we should hear a word from our beloved coach, Joe Schmidt. Joe! (ALL CHEERING) Good evening, Schwein. Tonight I want to talk a little bit about discipline. I want discipline. The board wants discipline, my assistants want discipline, and I'm gonna get discipline. (ALL LAUGHING) I want to talk about some of the pleasantries on our ball club. Fines! I love fines. Pat Studstill, $23, for making love to your wife after Friday. What about Thursday? I love fines. Ron Kramer, 23 cents for only making love to your wife once every six weeks, whether she needs it or not. (ALL LAUGHING) And John Gordy, $193, just for not ever making love to anybody in the world. (CROWD WHOOPING) BOTH: * Well, I got two lovers * And I ain't ashamed * Two lovers and I love them both the same * Let me tell you about my first lover * She's sweet and kind, she's mine all mine * Treats me good like a lover should * And it makes me love her * I really, really love her * Whoa * I love her so * And I'll do everything * I can to let her know I have great news! Tonight I unveil our secret weapon. $800,000, no cut, no trade bonus baby. Never played. He can run, kick, do everything great. You'll love him. I love him. Curtains, please. George Plimpton. (ALL APPLAUDING) Look at him. Look at the legs. Look at those legs. A hundred yard dash. Nine, one. A bundle of muscles. Strong, but most of all, shoulders. Tremendous shoulders. And with that we'll win the Super Bowl and have it locked up. Completely and... GEORGE: It was a put down, I know. MAN: How would you know? I know, I was there, wasn't I? You played a hell of a run. Forget about it, will you? Don't get so excited. It was probably your idea too. What was? Why, to have the defense lay down for us. George, we enjoyed having you at camp. It broke the monotony. Oh, well, the hell with that. That's not what I'm talking about. Besides you're learning to swear real good. So you see, you can't be all bad. Really? ALEX: We're just trying to make you feel good, George, so you can take memories back to New York with you, that's all. It was a put down. Say, why don't you drink your beer? What do you want to do, ruin the whole party? How do you know I couldn't really have done it? 'Cause you'd have gotten killed, that's why I know. Says who? Me. Oh, you guys are so tough. Nobody's as tough as the pro football? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me tell you something. You want to know something? You want to know what tough really is? You want to know what Percy Haughton did when he was coaching football at Harvard? Percy? KARRAS: Haughton? Haughton? Percy Haughton at Harvard. You know what he did to get the guys up for the Yale game? He took a bulldog and he strangled it with his bare hands. (GROWLING) (ALL LAUGHING) George! (BOTH LAUGHING) All right, all right. ALEX: Okay, chugalug. Chugalug all the way. Chugalug. Chug away. Chug away. All the way. All the way. All the way. All the way. All the way. (ALL CHEERING) ALEX: Beautiful. Come on, George. For Harvard. Do it for Harvard. (COUGHING) All right. All right, then you do it. Let me see you do it. Come on, come on, Lucci. All right, Lucci, ready? ALEX: Here we go. ALL: * Zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba * Roll along, you mangy waters * Roll along Come on! Hey, wait a minute. Shut up. Shut up. Wait a minute. Hey, Ron, wait a minute! Just wait around. I'm gonna put you out of business. I could have done it. I could have beat 'em! I could've done it. I could've beat 'em right out... * Zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba * Zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba, zuba * Roll along, you mangy waters * Hey, come on, Pat, we're gonna show them. Come on. Opposite right. Brown left, X and nine center. On two. Ready? All right. Great. Here we go. Four. Hut! Thirty-two. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Go, Pat. Go. Go. (MAN EXCLAIMING) All right, that's enough. I'm fed up. I'm really sick and tired. I'm gonna tear you guys apart. I'm losing my patience. Now, stop it! I'm gonna really tear you... I'm not kidding. I'll destroy you. (ALL LAUGHING) I'll break you in half! I'll get you. I'll tear you piece by piece apart. CHARLES: Now, this is the Cardinal over-gap now. Appears on offenses, a weak safety blitz. You can tell how Wilson comes right up about three yards from the line of scrimmage. They really tell you when they're coming. They come anyhow. JOE: Okay, run that again. Look at that crazy blitz. What kind is it? That's a Cardinal blitz. Everybody comes, coaches, everybody, man. CHARLES: All right, look at Wilson, now, on defense. Right up there on the crack on the weak side, it's gonna be a blitz and he came that time. Safety blitz. Just keep your eye on number eight, he'll tell you. Most every defense as to what is gonna be coverage wise. How about 72? He's got 50 pounds on me. If I was him playing against you, I'd bust out laughing. Hey, Pat. Shut up! (ALL LAUGHING) CHARLES: Safety up there playing tight. Misses more often than not. Just watch the position of that weak safety. Position, 37. Plays it real close. What do you think you can get on him, Pat? I'll be able to get deep on him. COACH: The halfback, you can see Hart hit the receiver right on the money. Real fine throw. Kid releases the ball very quickly. BILL: You know, he's just a rookie. We can probably shake him up throwing a little combination in his zone. JIM: We plan to blitz him too. CHARLES: Now, here's the slot formation. Now we're gonna use this against them. The Bears didn't use it very effectively. They're missing the block to keep... Hey, George. I thought you were leaving today. Why? I haven't been cut, have I? Not that I know of. All right, lights! All right, quiet down, quiet down. You see here in the film that St. Louis is a fine football team. Both offensively and defensively. Now, in order to win, we have to be at our very best. Now, this week we're gonna concentrate on techniques, and execution. Now, this is a pre-season game, but I want to win. We have to set that pattern for winning. It's very important that we do this. Now, if there are no questions pertaining to St. Louis, we'll see you on the field at 10:00 tomorrow morning. All right, hold it, hold it, hold it! Some of you may know it and some of you may not, we traded Roger Brown to the Los Angeles Rams. (ALL MURMURING) Jerry... Jerry, you'll take Roger's part at defensive tackle. Joe, I don't think I'm being unreasonable. One series, that's all I want. I mean, if we get far enough ahead, so I can't do any harm. Say, two touchdowns. Say, we get two touchdowns ahead, and there's not enough time for St. Louis to catch up. What about then? Joe, if it's okay with you, we'll play for George. Yeah, if it's safe, give him a try. A real game, huh, George? Now, say if we get three touchdowns ahead, 21 points. What harm could it do? Well, George, we're just gonna have to see. Look. You haven't been out drinking with the St. Louis Cardinals. They're no big buddies of yours or anything. I know. That's the whole idea. George, they don't know you're George Plimpton, super writer. They think you're George Plimpton, super rookie. Good. That's better. You really think you can do it. Don't you? Do what? Be the high school football hero. Oh, I do not. You do so. I don't. That's silly. I don't think so. I think you'd better come back to New York with me and see a shrink. (CHUCKLES) A shrink? Don't be ridiculous. You do so. You really think you could do it. Well, I have been in training, you know? George! Come on, you'd better get out. This is liable to cost me a $50 fine if we stay here any longer. Better than you should get killed. (CHATTERING) Just keeps droppin' like hell. I don't know what's going on. Don't worry about it, Tommy, just watch the ball into your hand, and once you get it, just play with it. That's the thing about it, I got to catch it first, but to think about it, I've been dropping it... I am. I really am. (LAUGHING) BILL: Third down and over four. We'll go slot right, green right, X stop. We should catch a safety zone, or a combination zone on that, if they're not blitzin'. Even if they are blitzing we can release to the... We can release to the fullback in a quick circle. So we'll go slot right, green right, X stop. That's your first three plays right there. All right, just in general now. St. Louis is a blitzing team. We've told you all week long and as you've seen in films that we've looked at here from last year. This ball club blitzes 60 to 70 percent of the time. This is high in the NFL. The only possible exception would be the Bears. They are the only team that blitzes anywhere. BILL: This is the name of the game. This is the essence of the whole defense. And they do it off a number of different alignments, so we've got to be alert to recognize what those alignments are. Okay, now the only two reminders that you have to be aware of at all times is that we're in our opposite formations, with one brown left or brown right. You've got to key the strong safety. All right, now, we're in split backs. Split backs, we're using green protection. The only thing we can't pick up off their blitzes is their weak safety blitz. So, on this you watch for the weak safety, and your split end is watching as well. If he comes on a blitz, you come to the split end on the quick post. It's one of those games, you don't have to use any check offs. You can use all kinds of over, over stacks, under, under stacks, gap defenses. If you try to check off this game, you can spend the whole game masterminding the ball game, so don't use any audibles. (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) Give me your attention. I want everybody hustling. Covering the punts, kick offs, on returns. Let's form their wall, give the runners a chance to run. When you receive, let's take that ball right up the field. The wedge, I want everybody to form their wedge, and give us an opportunity to run. Offensively, been working on our running game, we have to establish our running game right off the bat. Now, anytime that we lose the ball, fumble, interception, I don't want anybody losing their poise. Because we gotta come right back and start all over again. Defensively, we have to get out there, and get after that quarterback right off the bat. And I want everybody giving 100 percent. Everybody contributing to this team. Starting out to get a mental attitude that is going to carry us throughout the season. It's a big ball game for us, even though it's a pre-season game. It's important that we win. And it's important that we do our job. So, let's go. Our ball game, our ball game. (WHISTLE BLOWING) (ALL SHOUTING) Let's go, offense. Let's go, offense. Move 'em on the field. Let's go. Let's hustle. All right, all right. MAN 1: Come on, baby. Let's go! Go baby, go. MAN 2: Get up, get up, get up, get up. (WHISTLE BLOWING) MAN 3: How do we get some field room in there? MAN 4: Come on, get it up, baby. MAN 5: Keep driving, baby, keep driving. Keep driving. MAN 6: Go, go, go. COACH: What's the matter? You okay? MAN 7: Come on, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. MAN 8: Come on now. All right, nice, nice, nice. Go! Yeah, yeah. The guy stripped him. (CHATTERING) Try to concentrate. MAN 9: It's all right, it's all right. Get the ball. (CROWD CHEERING) (PLAYERS YELLING) Good job. PLAYER 1: You've got to be kidding. PLAYER 2: I feel like I'm gonna throw up all over you. PLAYER 3: Don't let them knock the piss out of you. (PLAYER 2 VOMITING) Don't give in. COACH: Come on, come on, let's get to 'em. Let's get to 'em. Twenty-nine! Twenty-five! MAN 1: What you say? What you say? Hey, rookie, what you think? PLAYER 1: Hut! ANNOUNCER: Here they come, here they come, it's a screen. And it's good. PLAYER 1: Ready! Hut! (CROWD ROARING) COACH: Come on, get him. Put him on the ground! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Watch that pass. He stepped on me. Come on, Alex PLAYER 2: Let's get him, let's get him. (CROWD CHEERING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) Come on, come on, come on, let's go! No, please don't, please don't. Please. Jim Hart, young rookie quarterback, hits Jackie Smith for about 30 yards, and it's the Cards ball, first in goal with the three. Get one in there, come on, baby. COACH: Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle. We're in trouble now, baby. MAN 1: They're walking in, Bernie. MAN 2: Come on, Ralph, come up there. MAN 3: Don't let them score. MAN 4: Come on, get that son of a gun. COACH: Don't let them score, now, don't let them score. PLAYER 1: Six! (PLAYERS CHATTERING) PLAYER 1: Thirty-two! Four! Twenty-five! Sixty-eight! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! (PLAYERS GRUNTING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) PLAYER 2: Bull, so tired about the quarterback. Every team we ever play, it's the quarterback, the quarterback. (PLAYERS CHATTERING) PLAYER 1: No support from the inside. PLAYER 2: Yeah, Weger should have been up there. COACH: All right, easy. Just settle down. PLAYER 3: Four, three, 88! PLAYER 1: He came into me. He was holding. All move, all move. All right. (CROWD MUTTERING) MAN 1: Look at Ron Kramer. Kramer is wide open. Not even thinking. He's not even looking. They're doubling out there, and he didn't even... And Kramer was open right now. Come on, get those guys together. God. Hell, if he doesn't start thinking any better than that, we'd better get him the hell out of there. MAN 2: A lot of pressure on him. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Nobody even covered me. Nobody even covered me. Nobody. You stay right around here now, where we can get you. I don't know what the hell's wrong with him. MAN 3: Why sure, all he had to do was take a look. He's hurrying to score, too much. He gets back there and he's pushing away. Okay. (PLAYERS CHATTERING) Four. (PLAYERS CHATTERING) MAN: Over gap. Over gap. Come on, Karl. (ALL GRUNTING) What the hell is he thinking of? MAN: Cut in, cut in. Here he comes. Almost done. Almost done. All right, boy, he gets the first. All right, baby. All right. Ninety! Hut! Hut! PLAYER: Run, run, run, you mother...

First time out, first time in. All right. Kick off. Thank you. All right, we got a taste of a little blood now, we're all right. They're gonna come after us, now, boy. Tough as hell. We'll bury these guys. We'll bury them, now. Oh, yeah. They might kill us. Put up defense, you guys. (CHATTERING) Hut! (CROWD ROARING) There's a clipping MAN: There's a penalty for who? There's a clipping against them. Think so? Should be a red. There he is lying on the ground. Fifty... Yeah, hey, John. Fifty-two should get it. Communication was bad there. Yeah, 52 should get it. It should be a penalty against them. Oh, against us? (CROWD GROANS) Oh, he got it. He got it, he got it! Oh, he got it. He didn't trap that ball. They were coming at him, Bart. They didn't have much time. He didn't have much time. Golly, looks like he got a couple inches off the ground. Yeah, good pressure. COACH: Good block. Good block. That's good. All the way. All the way! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) I thought we was gonna break it one time. Very good, Tommy. Very good, Larry. Good. Run, run, run, you mother... That's it. Fold it up. All right, go get it, go get it. Atta, baby. (CROWD CHEERING) That's right. That's the way to do it. He took it out. He had grass to grab in. Good cross. Hustle down. Atta, baby. Hut! (WHISTLE BLOWS) Atta boy. All right. Bring it in. I hit my hand. There's something wrong with my hand. I was gonna have it x-rayed but what the hell, you know? A little pressure on quarterback.

Touchdown! Little bit more. Little bit more. COACH: I think we're getting a little bit more pressure. I could move much more. Just a little bit off. Just that much off, just half a second. You were that close, just getting rid of that. I was trying to twist them, we can open on the twist. All right. First chance we get, we'll throw a twist. We'll use a defense. (PLAYERS CHATTERING) Let's go defenses. Let's go. PLAYER: You hold me again, I'll punch your head off. You hear what I said? You hold me again, I'll punch your head off. Hut! (WHISTLE BLOWS) (MAN GROANING) (PLAYERS CHATTERING) (GROANS) You know what you can do to beat this wrap. Run the ball. Run it out, baby. Just keep running. Give us a vacation. Don't pass it, Mel.

Can you tell what he called? Four, six! GEORGE: Thirty-two! MAN 1: Let's get 'em. Let's get 'em. Oh, my God, he's gonna run for a pass. He's gonna pass? MAN 2: Hit, George. I'm in the clear. (CROWD WHISTLING) Throw the damn ball, George. George! (GROANS) (CROWD SHOUTING) (COUGHING) DOCTOR: Take a couple of whiffs of this. A couple of few deeps. Atta, boy. What's your name? Plimpton. What city are you in? I'm in St. Louis. I want you to start with 100 and count backwards for me. One hundred, 99, 98... I think you're coming good, George. How is he, Doctor? George is gonna be all right. But, Joe, I don't know how those goal posts are gonna be. How do you feel? Like I had my pants taken down in front of 60,000 people. Well, you did all right. Oh, yeah. I must have set some new kind of record. Three plays and I lost 41 yards. I made an ass of myself. Oh, the important thing is that you hung in there. Hey, George, I hear you're leaving us. Yeah, they traded me for Johnny Unitas. That's a bum deal, Joe. The front office should have their head examined. (CHUCKLES) I'll see you, George. Hey, George, guys on the team voted you the game ball. We couldn't take it away from you anyway. Listen, George, you've got that apartment in New York, and all those girls, that's not such a bad deal, is it? Don't forget to come back to camp next year. Thank you. Don't try out for flanker, George.
