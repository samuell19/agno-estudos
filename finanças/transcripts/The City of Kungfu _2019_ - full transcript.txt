[English subtitles are available] [The City of Kungfu] [Guide] [We are at the Old Street of Fu City right now.] [The Old Street of Fu City is more than 300 years old.] [You can go ahead and take a look around here.] [Before this, the whole street was full of martial arts dojos.] [For example, Tai Chi, Wing Chun and Bak Mei.] [They were all here.] [But now, this street is full of people who have inherited their legacy.] [They are using their own way to pass down the culture of their martial arts.] [But unfortunately, there is nobody in this street that knows kungfu now.] There is someone who knows kungfu still! He's chasing the thief! Move aside! Stop right there! Move aside! Stop right there! What a lunatic. Move aside! Go away! Move aside! Stop right there! Move aside! Move aside! -Boss, are my buns ready? -Yes. That is Tai Chi. -Great! -Amazing. Great. Go away! Move aside! Move aside! Go away! Move aside! Move aside! Move aside! Go away! Stop right there! [We can take pictures now. All of these around us are historical buildings.] -[They are beautiful.] -They have a kungfu show over there. [Guide] They don't look like people from Old Street. [Harmony] Go away! What are you looking at? Don't run! My fellow friends, is there anyone who wants to give it a try? I'll give it a try. Go away. [Luowang Shop] Move aside! Move aside, all of you! Move aside! All of you have seen my master's capability. If you buy Tiancheng Sect's secret tome of Qi Gong now, you can practise our sect's Qi Gong at the comfort of your home. If you pay by scanning this QR code, you can get the digital version of it. Move aside! Go away! How many times have I told you not to let me see you again? If you come to Old Street again, -I'll beat you to death. Do you hear me? -Yes. Get lost! Is this yours? Be careful. Uncle, which unit are you from? I don't think you are from Old Street, right? We are Tiancheng Qi Gong Sect. Can't we practise martial arts if we are not from Old Street? The Old Street's kungfu has declined. We just want to contribute to this culture. I think he's right. But I think I just chased away a bunch of tricksters last week. Are you saying that I'm a trickster? No. I'm not saying that you are a trickster. I'm saying that you and everyone in your group are tricksters. -Is that true? -Stop causing any more troubles. Looks like you are here to ruin my business. Do you know kungfu? Let's put it to test. I might beat you up. -Don't hit my face! -Stop. Stop! No. Stop! Are you okay? Are you okay? I can't believe you! Hello. My name is Wang Xi. I'm from the Old Street of Fu City. -You are from the Old Street? -Yes. I'm from Old Street too. Why have I not seen you before? I'll explain this to you in the future. By the way, you fought very well just now. -What kind of a kungfu is that? -Kick-boxing. You haven't told me your name yet. I am Li Yi. -Li Yi. -Yes. Brother Li Yi. Which sect are you from? I couldn't tell from your moves just now. I'm sorry for that. I'm not from any particular sect. You are from Old Street but you know nothing. Everybody knows that there is no real sect or the so-called successor in Old Street. Nobody learns kungfu anymore and there's no one to teach it. But everyone here knows a little bit of kungfu to attract the tourists and do some business. It has been too long since I last came back. Then, where did you learn your kungfu from? I learnt it through online videos. You learnt it from online videos? -Yes. -And you used it in real fight? I think you are a genius. You are too kind. It's not painful anymore? I was at the upper hand today. Why would I feel painful? Right. Grandpa Chen. I heard that you fought with someone today. I was proving our Old Street's kungfu to them. Those tricksters are deceiving others. I can't take it. Now, there's no one in Old Street who learns kungfu anymore. They turned this place into a tourism spot to attract tourists and give us more business. Why did you go and provoke them? Grandpa Chen, let me tell you. This is the thinking of the majority of the people here. Because of this thinking, the century-old kungfu of the Old Street is gone just like that. Grandpa Chen. Did Xiao Xiao tell you about the man we met this morning? He said that he learnt kick-boxing. He was amazing. He beat up all those tricksters. Great. He's amazing. Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go. The police will be here. -This is considered as fighting. -Yes. Let's go. No. I mean the both of us. You can continue to show the tourists around. -Let's go. -Yes. Continue with your work. Let's go. You! Suddenly, I think that the kungfu that I've learnt is not that useful. Kungfu is not the problem. You are. Stop causing any more troubles. Find a proper job. No. You didn’t see that person’s kick-boxing. He’s good. Compared to kungfu, his kick-boxing is way better. Come, your wonton is ready. -Take it. -Thank you. Let me tell you. Kungfu can be passed down for hundreds of thousands of years because it is a killing technique. What's the point of learning it now? It's useless. It's just a hobby. You just learn it to be healthy and strong. Even if you learn it now, you won't be practising it from morning until night like before. You just treat it like a hobby. Kick-boxing is a western boxing style. They use science and professional team to train the fighters' physical strength, speed and power. Yes. That's why I want to learn kick-boxing too. I'll say it again. Kungfu is on par with kick-boxing. But you have time to practise kungfu now, right? Use this time to earn money and feed yourself. Grandpa, why are you doing this in the middle of the night? I... You made me burnt myself. Grandpa. I know that you don't want me to learn kungfu. But I really want to learn it. You didn't say anything when I hid in my room to practise when I was young. Why are you unhappy now that I want to learn something new? It's not that I don't want to listen to you. The kungfu that is passed down to us is no longer useful. We have to keep pace with the times, right? Grandpa, do you know about kick-boxing? It's so powerful. You can use it to defeat people easily. I'm telling you the truth. Grandpa, how about this. I'll learn it first. If it's just a parlour trick, I'll stop learning it, okay? You love me the most. Don't be mad at me. [Honorary Credential] [Why are you so naughty?] Okay. Stop. -Move to the left. -Okay. Move to the left. Move to the right! Excuse me, you are stepping on my foot. My leg! I'm doomed. You tripped me. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital? Wipe it clean and move it to the right. -To the left. -I'm fine now. [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] Brother Xi. Li Yi? Why are you here? I'm learning kick-boxing now. I just finished my morning training. I just happened to pass by. I saw them putting up this Fu City Fighting Fair... [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring] Featuring. Featuring Cold Weapon. [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] -Is this going to be held in Fu City? -No. This is our company's newly-developed kungfu theme park. It's called The City of Kungfu. Wow, Brother Xi. You are really a promising young man. The City of Kungfu sounds so grand! Can I participate? Look at what I've learnt. -I think I'm doing well. -Of course you can. I'll send my staff to inform you when it starts. Really? Awesome. I've always wanted to become an ace. Didn't you say that I'm very talented? Yes. This is called unprecedented and... Unrepeatable. Can you move aside? [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] Li Yi. Come to our company, Boxing Club, when you are free. I'll introduce you to someone. My boss, Mr. Norris. -No... -Norris. -A foreigner? -Yes. Mr. Norris is a foreigner. Before he retired, he was the world champion in lightweight kick-boxing. After he retired, he started to delve into real estate and invest in China's artwork. Look. We are using this chance to promote this ancient weapon that we have invested in. At the same time, we are promoting Chinese kungfu. We have to pass down this culture. -Director Wang, come and take a look. -Not bad. Okay. Li Yi, continue with your morning training. I have to work. Okay. Go back to your work. The City of Kungfu. [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] There are so many professional fighters here. Why are you here? We are promoting the Old Street. Of course I have to be here. But I never thought that there are so many people who still practise martial arts. Let me tell you. I'm sure that there are people who are just here to take advantage of this. There. -Let's check him out. Let's go. -Okay. Wow. You are even doing a squat here? This is Tai Chi. A kungfu that counters hard with soft and uses the power from outside force. Amazing. Li Yi. I thought Auntie Xu is the only one who knows Tai Chi. Hurry up and get down. I'm sorry. You are so ignorant. There are many different sects in Tai Chi. Great! Wow. -He's amazing. -Awesome. Master. My boss wants to learn from you. This is the foreigner that Wang Xi mentioned. The world champion of kick-boxing. This will be interesting then. I'm the seventh generation of Wu Clan Tai Chi, Wu Zi Qing. He's not using Tai Chi. Please tell him to use Tai Chi now. Yes. Master, my boss wants you to fight him with Tai Chi. This is too embarrassing. Hello, everybody. We organised this event to promote and develop Chinese kungfu and the spirit of kungfu. But we don't accept fake kungfu here. Good! Well said! [Hello, everyone.] [Hello, everyone.] -Who is she? -[Be quiet!] [Ladies and gentlemen, how are you?] [I am Epoch Group's CEO,] [Mr. Norris's assistant.] [Thank you for joining us in this Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon.] [The main goal of this event is to revive the dwindling Chinese kungfu.] [Next, please put your hands together to welcome Mr. Norris. Welcome!] [Hello everyone and welcome.] [Please forgive my poor Chinese.] [But I'd like to say this.] [Bruce Lee is my idol and I love Chinese kungfu.] [However,] [it deeply hurts me to see Chinese kungfu disappearing.] [And I'm hoping that this event] [can bring Chinese kungfu back to its top again.] Thank you, everyone. Great! [Good day.] [I am Wang Xi.] [I am a kick-boxer in Boxing Club under Epoch Group.] [But I have another identity.] [I was born in Old Street.] [Although I've left Fu City for many years,] [I can see that the most valuable thing in Fu City, the origin of kungfu,] [slowly disappearing from the limelight. My heart aches for that.] [But I'm very lucky this time] [to be able to come back to my home town to revive] [Chinese kungfu with my boss, Mr. Norris who loves kungfu as well.] [It's an honour.] Great! Great! [Mr. Norris's father left him a treasure] [before he passed away.] [And that treasure] [comes from our Old Street.] [We'll show that to you now.] So, it's true that there are weapons in Old Street. But my grandfather told me that it's just a legend. [We heard that there are still many more weapons] [that are hidden in the hands of the descendants of each sect in Old Street.] [But there's a rule in Old Street.] [We can never show these weapons to the public.] [I feel that it's such a waste.] [Because of this conservative thinking,] [Chinese kungfu is declining slowly but surely.] -He has a point. -[This time, we won't] [lock this Qiankun Axe up.] [We'll exhibit it here for a month.] [We hope that we can change the thinking of some of the people here] [so that they can contribute] [to the culture of Chinese kungfu like us.] -Great! -Great! Well said! [Okay!] [Now, you can take a look at this Qiankun Axe.] This way please. Hello, Mr. No. I am Li Yi. We are all friends. What are you doing? Jessica, this is my friend. So feisty. What are you talking about? I mean fierce. You are... [Nice to meet you, Mr. Norris.] [I am Li Yi.] [This is my girl, Chen Xiao.] [We come from the Old Street of Kungfu City.] [We know all the streets very well.] [I have the same passion to change the modern-day situation of kungfu.] [I am a kick-boxer too.] [I want to join you.] [Hi, how are you, Li Yi?] [You said that you know the Old Street well and you want to join my company.] -[Right?] -Yes. [Yes.] Li Yi, Mr. Norris wants to invite both of you to dinner tonight. Six o'clock tonight at room no.1 of Fortune Restaurant. Really? Great! See you tonight, Mr. Norris. Li Yi. Oh, yeah. See you. Li Yi. -Hello. -Hello, Brother Xi. Stop looking. He can't come become something came up in the last moment. I'm here in his stead. But it won't make a difference. You should've told me earlier. This shirt is so warm. Then, I won't have to wear like this. I can't believe you. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come. Cheers. Come. Have a seat. Let's eat. Li Yi. After Mr. Norris found out that you know the Old Street well, he wants you to help him find all the successors of the sects here. I'm talking about the successors of the real sects here. We want to help out the Old Street. Li Yi. Brother Xi, that's great. Please continue. I know that these successors have their own weapons, right? Brother Xi. Actually, we've only heard about it when we were young. But my grandfather told me that they are just legends. It's okay. What we mean is, just help us find the real successors of the sects in Old Street. It doesn't matter what shops they open or what business they are in. We can combine their shops with kungfu. Then, we can modernise them and build them kungfu-themed shops. Don't you think that it can improve their business? But there's a problem. How can we prove that they are the real successors of those sects? So, the weapons will be the proof. That makes sense. We've seen too many fake masters and fake successors nowadays. But Brother Xi. Even if the legend is true, I don't think they'll be willing to hand over their weapons. It's okay. We know the rules of Old Street. If they don't want to hand over their weapons, we won't force them to. We are just doing this as a charity. Why do you want to know about those weapons? They are just some old metal scraps. Of course we have to know. We want to help them rebuild their shops. We have to first find out the history about the weapons so that we can help him. Come, eat. Li Yi. Mr. Norris has already planned for you. He said that if you are willing to help him and this Old Street, he will hire you as a boxer in our Boxing Club under Epoch Group. -Really? -Yes. Great! Come, let's eat. Here. Eat this. Brother Xi. What is it? What is it? I have another request. I don't know... I don't know if I can say it or not. We are friends. Just say it. It's like this. Xiao Xiao is a guide in Old Street. She works under rain and sun every day. Can you find her a job as well? Li Yi. This is quite hard. I can only get her a job tomorrow. Great. Cheers, Brother Xi. -Bottoms up. -Okay. Come. Cheers. -Li Yi! -I know how to fight. Slow down! Old people like you don't pass down your kungfu properly. Even the westerner can't take it anymore. Li Yi. This is the only thing that I can do. Because I want to become a hero. You... Kick-boxing! Gulp. Gulp. Li Yi! -Great! -Great! You are here. How is it? How's your first day at work? It's great. This is indeed a big company. The workload is heavy on the first day. -But I like it a lot. -It's good that you like it. By the way, the company is very considerate. They even prepared a place for me to stay near the company. At first, I have a lot of things to do today. But Li Yi forced me to come here to rest for a while. You are new here, so there will be more work for you. You'll be fine after this. Li Yi. Brother Xi, you are looking for me? Bring me a set of clothing. You have to change your clothes first. Here, this is for you. So kind of you. -Can't I wear this? -Just change it. Mine is more professional. Okay. I'll come back soon. -He... -Brother Xi. So fast? I even went to the toilet. Let's start. -Okay, let's warm up first. -Okay. I won't disturb you then. I'll go back to work now. Okay, let's go. Come! Come on. Come, let me teach you the basics first. Follow me. One! -One! Two! Three! -One! Two! -Three! -Four! Four! Li Yi. Look. You are the same as me now. We are a part of Epoch Group right now. You have to put the company first. So, you have to work harder. Brother Xi, don't worry. I'm quite determined since young. In the past, I was the last in our class. -In the end, I persevered and got... -First place. Second last. I don't care how many awards you had before. I didn't have any awards before. They are useless. Brother Xi. When can I join the competition? It's only glory when I defeat my opponent in the ring. Do you know, Li Yi. Your main mission now is to help revive our home town, Old Street. Mr. Norris has put in a lot of effort to promote the kungfu of Old Street. He's a foreigner. But he has done so much for the things that he likes. As the descendants of Old Street, isn't it our duty to help him? Brother Xi, say no more. Same as you, it'll be an honour to serve the people of Old Street. Brother Xi, you have to teach me and guide me well. For the glory of our company and to protect our Old Street. Okay. Come. One! -One! -Two. So, Li Yi, how's the training going? Li Yi. Li Yi. Mr. Norris is asking you about your training. It's going quite well. Since I'm born with the talent. Move aside. Move aside. So feisty. Xiao Xiao, let me tell you. He is very talented. He's a diamond in the rough. You are too kind. That's good. So let's talk about our plan. By the way, Li Yi, we've written some proposals about the Old Street. Please take a look at it. Jessica. No. It's okay, Brother Xi. Your proposal is already very good. If the company needs me, I'll definitely do my best to help/ I'll take a look at it then. Let me see if I need to amend anything. Li Yi. You are closer to the successors of all the sects in Old Street. They might be more open to your suggestions. So, I think you are very suitable for this job. There are many design sketches inside it. And there are some business proposals and strategies too. It's not bad. It's indeed different. Don't worry about everything. The cost of it will be fully paid by Epoch Group. But the most important thing is, There is no indemnity clause. Mr. Norris, you are such a great person! A great person? Yes. You are Old Street's benefactor. And I'm considered great just because of that? Li Yi, sit down. This time, I'll be the supervisor. A lot of construction materials are poisonous. They will release formaldehyde. It's bad for the body. So, before we refurbish their shops, it's better if we can move them away first. It'll be better for their health. You are right. By the way, Brother Xi, We have to wait for everything to dry up after renovation, right? Yes. Li Yi, Mr. Norris has already said this. He said that this job can only be done by a person who has a say in this Old Street. You are the right man for it. That's right. Wait for a moment. Hurry up and say it. What is it? -Don't take it from me. Can you read? -Let me see. -Let me see. Let go. -I'll tell you after I read it. -Give it to me. -Stop! -Look. -What is this? I've officially joined the Epoch Group. They put me in an important position. And I didn't forget about you. I put in a lot of effort to get this project. What project is this? It's a project to rebuild Old Street. -Rebuild Old Street? -Rebuild Old Street? -What does that mean? -I'll be the person-in-charge. Next, we'll fully renovate all the shops on both sides of Old Street to build an Old Street infused with the uniqueness of kungfu. And the three of you will be the first batch. The butcher shop of Uncle Sun, the noodle shop of Auntie Xu and the nuts shop of Grandpa Liu. You are the beneficiaries of this project. But, why did they choose us? Because you have roots here. -Roots? -Yes. All of you are among the few real martial artists in Old Street. This is your root. We might be the successor, But we haven't practise our kungfu for a long time. -Yes. -It's okay, Master. I know. You don't, Brother Rou. Actually, it doesn't matter whether you know it or not. We just need the proof that you are the real successors of the sects here. Just now, you talked about renovating the place for us. What about the cost? Of course you don't have to pay. Everything will be funded by our group. Where can we stay when the shop is in renovation then? Don't worry about that. Epoch Group will settle everything for you. First, they'll find you a place to stay. Next, they compensate you for the operating deficit during the period of the renovation. As for the amount, it'll be based on your best turnover. -How's that? -It's really a steal! It's really a steal. Tell me then. Why is Epoch Group willing to help us out so much? Auntie Xu. There is only one Fu City in this country. And there's only one Old Street in Fu City. The boss of Epoch Group, that foreigner, has the same dream as I do. And that dream is to revive our Chinese kungfu. As for why they are willing to do it, I think it's a good promotion for their company. Anyway, you won't understand. It's simple. Just trust me. This is like a God's gift. We don't even have to spend money. We are so lucky. We don't have to spend money. We are so lucky! By the way, during the renovation, remember to take your important belongings with you. You wouldn't want to lose it, right? You are right. Why will we be so lucky? -This is really a God's gift. -Yes. If I'm going to renovate my shop, I want a grand design for it. -I want a huge toilet. -Your toilet. Yours too. We don't have to pay for it anyway. [This Qiankun Axe really lives up to expectation.] This is why we come to Old Street. The home town of the axe. The Old Street of Fu City. I hope that the other weapons in Old Street will fall to the hands of the people who know their worth. I won't disappoint you. Brother Xi, do you know? This is the proudest thing that I've done in this life of mine. Look. We've all seen the effort that you've put in. Just leave the rest to me. Go back and continue with your training -so that you can fight in the next season. -Can I cook here? Let's unpack first before we go back. Didn't I say that they have everything in the hotel? You just need to bring some clothes with you. Look at all of these... It's okay. Just put them in the car. Okay. Let's go. Old people are troublesome. It's okay. Can I take some extra daily essentials? Sure. Go ahead. Thank you. They are old people. Please be understanding. It's okay. Old people like to take more things to be prepared for everything. -It's only normal. -This... -They are taking so many useless things. -It's okay. I'll take my leave now. Like I said, old people are really troublesome. Yes. Get to work! It'll be easier for us to renovate the place. Sure. It looks good. It's very thorough. Not bad. I found the machetes. Just leave the rest to me. -Believe me. -I do. Thank you. Hurry up. -Have you found it? -I'm looking for it. -Be thorough. -Okay. Hurry up. Boss, I found the sword. What are you doing? Old man, what are you doing here? What are you doing? Don't be rude! Grandpa Liu, why are you here? Were you digging for my sword? No, Grandpa Liu. We accidentally dug it out. If you want it, I can just return it to you. You've really kept these things hidden so well. Today, I'll spare your life. Let me tell you. Don't fight us. Kungfu? Guang. You are awake? You are all here. Brother Chen told us about you. I heard some noise when I cleaned up my stall last night. So, I rushed there. Brother Liu, what happened? Who hit you? Come. Brother Chen treated your wounds for you. He's the successor of Sky Pillar. He's the same as us. He doesn't want to be involved in the mess of this world anymore. Pillar Sect? The legendary sect with the most stable squad and the best qinggong technique. You are too kind. I'm not someone important. I'm just from a minor sect. You are the masters here. It's destiny that we are all gathered around here today. How did you get so seriously hurt? You were even shot by an arrow. This is Wang Xi's doing. We are all tricked. Wang Xi? What do you mean? I... How were we tricked? Last night, I wanted to buy something for them to eat. When I reached there, they were not renovating it at all. All of our weapons are taken away by Wang Xi's people. Then, me and Sister Xu's family weapons are... Those scoundrels. Li Yi. Li Yi was the one who proposed this to us in the beginning. When did he become like this? This is bad. My granddaughter has entered this Epoch Group as well. She always says that she's busy. I can't even reach her. But if she knows about this, she'll tell me about it for sure. This is strange. No. We have to take our things back from them. Don't. We are just a bunch of old people. We can't win. Then... Then, it'll be so unfair. How about we call the police? The police can arrest them. We can't do that. We don't have the evidence. Besides, you've already signed the contract. Brother Chen is right. We can do nothing. Let's confront Li Yi then. Based on our relationship with his grandfather, Li Yi has to settle this for us. Yes. Li Yi has to settle this for us. I still think that Li Yi is not that kind of man. [Be Safe and May Your Dream Comes True] Auntie Xu. Uncle Sun. You traitor. And to think that we watched you grow up. Don't be mad. Renovation takes time. They'll settle this for you. Moreover, I'm the manager now. If you have any problem, I can talk to them. Uncle Sun, what are you doing? So, this is really your doings. Tell us. Why did you do this to us? What did I do? What are you talking about? You animal. You helped the foreigner and his stooge, Wang Xi, to steal our weapons. -And you are still acting dumb here? -Don't! -Enough. -Don't. -Wait. What happened? -Put it down. How is this renovation related to weapons? Grandpa Liu was shot by Wang Xi with an arrow. Now, he's still resting from his wound in Grandpa Chen's house! What did you say? Grandpa Liu was injured by Wang Xi? What happened? You have to ask yourself that. You already got what you want. Aren't you satisfied yet? Uncle Sun. Just now, you said that we. No. They stole your weapon. Are you talking about your Eight Slashes Machetes? Looks like it's glaringly obvious that he's behind it. It's not like that. They told me that they want to promote the kungfu of Old Street. They want to look for the real successors and know more about the weapons. That's why I told them this information. If you are willing to help him and this Old Street, he will hire you as a boxer in our Boxing Club under Epoch Group. -Really? -Yes. Great! I'll tell you what I know then. But I'm not sure if it's real or not. Let's start with Uncle Sun. Uncle Sun is the butcher. They are the descendants of Wing Chun. They use the technique of dual wield. I heard that they have this pair of Eight Slashes Machetes. As for Grandpa Liu, his family practises Hung Ga. I heard that they have a Black Dragon Broadsword made from Wootz Steel. -It's made from Wootz Steel too? -Of course. And Auntie Xu. Her family has this Steel Duster. If we really use it, that Steel Duster will split your skin open. Continue. Who else? -That's it. -That's it? Just three families? Yes. There's Grandpa Chen too. He's Xiao Xiao's grandpa. But Grandpa Chen has no shop. And I don't think he has a weapon. It's okay. Come, let's eat. -Mr. Norris, I... -[Speak Chinese.] [I told you I have to exercise my Chinese.] Okay, Mr. Norris. I’ve already done what you asked. [Okay, if he wants to learn kick-boxing,] [let him. Give him what he wants] [and he'll work harder for us.] [Understand?] Yes. I planned to do that anyway. -He'll come to our club tomorrow. -[Another thing.] [Beware of that girl. Keep an eye on her.] Okay, Mr. Norris. Let's go. I'm fine. You better don't say that you are innocent. I didn't think much about it. I didn't believe that the weapons are real. Forget it. Let him go. Li Yi. No matter what had happened, we are no longer young. Please tell them that they can take our weapons. But don't come back and bother us anymore. We just want a peaceful life. Get lost. I don't want to see you anymore. Go. Go. Get up! Li Yi. What are you doing? -Ask him! -Can you calm down and talk properly? You are still helping him? Don't tell me that you are on his side too. Okay. Let me tell you. He injured Grandpa Liu and took away the ancient weapons of the three masters in Old Street. Say something. Say something! You don't dare to admit it now? Now, I understand. You tricked me together with that foreigner. You tricked me into helping you to steal the things that belong to Old Street! I thought that you saw something promising in me. Li Yi, is this a misunderstanding? Why would he trick them? Because he knows where the weapons were hidden! Wang Xi, tell me. Where did you keep the weapons? Wang Xi won't do this. He won't. Li Yi. Do you really think that you are that great? Why didn't I kick you out before this? Because you were still a little bit useful to us. You are the person-in-charge of this Old Street. If something happens, you are the one to be blamed. You animal! Wang Xi, what are you doing? Remove your leg. Leave now! Let me tell you. This is me going easy on you. Go back and tell those old people in Old Street that they have no rights to fight with me! Li Yi! Li Yi! Li Yi. Li Yi. Grandpa Chen. Don't move. Although it's not serious, you still have to rest, okay? Are you okay now? How are you feeling now? I'm sorry. Why are you apologising? We should be the one apologising. We blamed you wrongly and let you got hurt. Yes. I was too rash. I want to learn real kungfu from you. Please teach me. Look at you now. You can even bow to us. Just focus on your recovery. They are still waiting to drink your tea. Brother Chen! It's not that we don't want to teach you. We hid our kungfu because we don't want any troubles. And we don't want you to get hurt because of us again. Auntie Xu. Uncle Sun. Grandpa Liu. This has happened because I was careless. Before this, I had taken a lot of wrong paths. But now, I really want to learn kungfu. I'll give my whole life to you. Accept me as your disciple! I will practise hard and pass down your kungfu to the next generation. Auntie Xu. Uncle Sun. Grandpa Liu. You've watched over him since young. You know his personality better than anyone. Although he's not attentive enough, he'll definitely do well in things that he sets his mind to. Great. I'll accept you as my disciple then. Brother Liu. Sister Xu. I think I have a great disciple. Don't fight for him with me. What rights do you have to accept him as your disciple? I didn't say that I'm not going to accept him. The three of us can accept him together then. Li Yi. Remember. From now on, you are no longer yourself anymore. You'll carry our reputations with you. You can't be so impulsive anymore. Okay. I promise. I'll bow to my masters now. -Sit down. -Sit down. Great! I'll be gentler. Focus on your breathing. Store your energy in your core. In Wing Chun, it'll be a close combat. Do a short bridge and one-inch punch. Start. Focus on your squad. I'll teach you about the four directions and eight diagrams now. You won't be able to learn this Hung Ga outside. -Okay. -Okay! Follow me! I want to learn how to use the weapons. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! This boy is quite talented. We found a gem. I think Brother Li will want to see him like this from heaven. Grandpa Chen. I've been eating your wonton every day since young. But I think I will never get tired of it. Stop buttering me up. You just want to get the girl, right? My kind grandfather. How can you say that? I'm pursing her earnestly. They are the same. But they sound different. -Are you feeling better now? -Yes. I think I've recovered well. You've recovered quite quickly. You are cut out for martial arts. Grandpa Chen, lately, I found out that the fancy boxing that I learnt online before this is not totally useless. It's just that I didn't know how to use it. But lately, after the training with my masters and with their guidance, I realised that I've already digested the moves since a long time ago. I just need to do an intensive training with those moves and I'll be able to utilise every move to achieve victory. Are you done? Yes. Come. Wow! Grandpa Chen, you are amazing! Is this magic? -Do you want to learn? -Yes. Grandpa Chen. I've already prepared everything you asked for. Good. What is the most important thing about kungfu? The basics? Your lower body. -Lower body? -Yes. Your lower body can make you as stable as mountain and it can make you as light as feather. I'll let you experience what it feels to be as stable as mountain. Come. Push me. -No. -Push me. No. If you can push me, I'll let Xiao Xiao marry you. Really? -I'll give my blessing. -You'll give your blessing? I'll give my blessing! Now, do you know what it feels to be as stable as mountain? Now, I'll let you know how it feels to be as light as a feather. [Chen Stall] Grandpa Chen, this is too hard. Walk. Get up! Walk. Walk. Grandpa Chen, this is too hard. There's a word 'leg' inside the phrase 'martial arts'. It means that the lower body is the foundation of kungfu. In the past, they use their lower body to travel. It'll be very dangerous if your lower body is not stable. Do you want to learn it or not? I already said. I want to learn. Hurry up and address him then! Grandpa. What is that? Master! Now that you call me master, you are older than her by a generation. Don't you want to... I better call you grandpa then. Great. This kungfu is called Sky Pillar. We have no weapon. We have only a Gold Body Armour. No weapon can pierce through it. I told them about your sect before. But I told them that you have neither a shop nor weapon. What if they find out that you have a soft armour? Don't worry. They won't be able to find it. Here. Take it. Really? Yes. How did Li Yi come up with this technique? I think he has become our master now. He might be the kungfu master of Old Street. Do you mean me? -Let's drink some tea. -Let's. [Chen Stall] Grandpa Chen. I've mastered... Grandpa Chen! Grandpa Chen, what's wrong? What happened? When they came for the soft armour, they couldn't find it. So, they took Xiao Xiao away. There is something that I haven't told you. Concealing our kungfu and weapons in Old Street is a rule set by your grandfather when he was still alive. He had no choice. He gave away his Qiankun Axe to bring peace to Old Street. Stop talking. Let me take you to Auntie Xu and the others. -Let's go! -Let's go. [Xu Noodle Shop] The soft armour is with me. Where is Chen Xiao? [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] Where is Chen Xiao? Where's the thing? It's with me. Let her go. [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] Can you see the no. 5 exhibition platform behind me? I just need the last one. If you give it to me, things will be easy. If you don't... [Fu City Fighting Fair Featuring Cold Weapon] Xiao Xiao? You've really surprised me. You suddenly become a kungfu master? How about we make a deal? Drop your weapon, give me your soft armour and I'll let her go. How about that? Okay. Let me take it off for you. Very talented. But in reality, you've just been training for a few months. Can you beat me? [I don't understand English.] Today, I witnessed real Chinese kungfu. You could've killed me so easily. But you didn't. [Reviving Chinese kungfu should not be a mean for you to seek profit.] [I'll let you go. Don't come back anymore.] [Another thing, there is no good or bad fighting techniques.] [The only things that matters are how hard and how much you've practised.] [Bon voyage.] Take your hands away. No. What are you doing?
