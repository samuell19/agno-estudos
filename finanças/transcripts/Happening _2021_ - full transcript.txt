Well? - You can't come like this. - And why not? It is not too shocking. If I were a man, I would do me. That is exactly the problem. - I didn't say I would. - You never know with you. It's Ma's turn. Do you want it tighter?? Yes. You're crazy. Hélène, you're next. - No. - Yes. Sure? Do you like it? - It's not too tight - It's fine. So Hélène, yes or no? - No, I can't. - And why not? - People will see me. - Exactly. - Come on! - No. Then one thing. Let's do this. Better? My shoes are squeaking.

It is difficult to get into university. Who wants to try? Miss, stand up please. What can you tell me about the hidden meaning of this poem? I don't know. We have already talked about Aragon. Was he present? I mean physically. Come on, do your best. Give me a response. Say something. - Hear she's leaving? - To get married, right? A maths student. An asshole. And spring?Is she stopping? However, it is probably better. One less. What a disaster! I'm afraid that in the end only you will be left. Can you handle it? Miss. Tell me about the poem. They use a love tragedy to evoke a national one. It is a political poem. Tell me about the recurring motives of the poem. Fire, tragedy, memory. I think they are referring to the war. When the poem was published in 1942, Elsa Triolet and Aragon were communists. I think that.... both hoped for for a patriotic awakening. Perfect. What is the name of the figure that consists in the the repetition of words regularly? Anaphora. Anaphora. You are too good! Do you have any gum?

We know you're smart. You're lucky. Look at your hands. All white. They are not meant to work. Now they've got me dyeing. In the factory. So... I no longer recognise my hands.

Do something. You can't ask me that. Neither me, nor anyone else. The law is clear about this. Anyone who helps you risks prison. So do you. And it can be worse. There's always some girl who challenges fate And he dies suffering unspeakable pain. You don't want to be that girl. This is not fair. Maybe I won't finish it! Maybe. Anna! Well? Where were you?

Not the words, I mean the 'eyes'l What do you mean? When Camus looks at us his gaze penetrates us. It inspires justice, humanity. Sartre is more ambiguous. Don't you hate it? How ca you eat it? You have to eat. I can't. If you want, take mine. No, thanks. I'm full. What's Sartre got to do with it now? I think it is difficult to understand. And it supports the communists. Supports Stalin, denies mass murder. My father is a communist, he has never killed anyone. - Excuse me. - It's OK. But that's not possible! Who ate my stuff? I don't know. My things are not in the fridge. This is unacceptable! Containers don't move by themselves! What now? People continue to steal food from each other. They take forever to wash. Yes, it is unbearable. - Rinse you girls off! - Yes! The hot water is finished. Certificate of pregnancy 4 weeks What about stretch marks? No, I don't have them. You're lucky. What about the legs?

How old were you? I don't know. 10, 11. They taught me so much. I guess. I am the most informed virgin on the planet. I can't do much now, but when I can, I won't get lost.

They say he plays with me But what else can I do? Every night I dream of going further and further. But if you get one, and it's the wrong one... Then... You end up pregnant. No, not pregnant! That would be the end of the world. In the worst case There are ways. What do you mean? If you don't want a baby. Are you crazy? Never say that again, even in jest. Did you bring your dirty laundry? The accusative case, is used with a direct object. The genitive case, indicates possession. And then, the dative case... is used with an indirect object. And finally, the ablative case, for relative circumstances. Write that down. Anna. Are you making eyes at me? Absolutely not. Am I disturbing you too much? Anna, wait... Well? You have to tell me something You know a lot of girls. You can say that, yes. Do you know someone who did it? What do you mean? - You mean... - No, not that. I have a problem, Jean.

You're pregnant, we don't risk anything. What? Why are you staring at me? What is that? You look sick. An insect! It could be syphilis. Yes, maybe. Easy women take it. Look, let's avoid a scene here. - Leave me alone. - Wait. Don't fuck with me! Here are the vulgarities, bravo. Anna here we have rules. They are the same for moons Understood? Respect them of course.

It's OK. - It's OK. - Stop it, Jean. Come on. Go back to the barracks. Wait. What do you want? - Do you have something to tell me? - Anne, stop it. You're pathetic, you have nothing to say to me.

How? - That's not our problem. Brigitte, come on. Do you want to go to prison with her? Do whatever you want, Anna. It is not our business. Brigitte! No. Can you hear me? It's Lisa. How did it go last night? Yes? Did he talk about me? Come on. Does he really mean it or is he kidding. Just a moment. Are you sure? I don't want to be wrong. Yes, of course. I'll have to call you back. See you soon. Take care. Sorry, it's an emergency. Hello? B0rdeaux-7733, please. Hold the line. - Hello? - Maxime? This is Anna. What a surprise. Listen, I need to tell you something. This sounds important. I am pregnant. Don't worry. I'm not going to keep it. It is not the right sponge. Not like that. Not good if it does not degrease. Go and study. - Can you hear me? - I don't feel like it. Don't you want to? You think you have to want to? Can we afford to do only what we want to do? You know what? Today I feel like... To sit outside in the sunshine and tanning my legs. The bar can wait. Is this how you will pass your exams? What do you know about the exams? He left me no choice. I do not approve, But I understand the motivation. A single mother. It is not easy. You are young. You have a life ahead of you. I would like to have a child one day, But not at the cost of my life. I could hate that kid. I could never love him. I would like to tell you that it worked. No. I'm sorry. The fetus resisted. There was blood. Scratched mucous membranes. I did everyhting. Everything. Injections. Pins. What injections? I saw another doctor. Did they prescribe estradiol? Yes. Most doctors are against abortion. They do not think that women should have a choice. Estradiol strengthens the embryo. Miss. Do you accept it? You have no other choice. 9 weeks I thought you had changed your mind. The train was late. Aren't you too tired? I'm fine. I'm glad you came. What are you doing? I am hesitating. I like this dress. You'll see. My friends are special. Funny, Friendly, intelligent, All of them. Everyone in his family is a lawyer, While in her's, all doctors. Maxime. I could not find a solution. What do you mean? I thought... What? That I could manage on my own. How many weeks pregnant are you? Almost 10. Is it too late? No. Max, are you there? Come on down. We're on our way. Don't say anything. Can you rub some cream on me? Why are you laughing? "Can you rub some cream on me?" Typical Palrick. You should put some on her too. It's all in the tone. Your questions sound like orders, But you always get away with it. At school they envy your voice. In politics the voice is a weapon. They call me Minister Minister..." You can already imagine yourself at the top. President! You already see yourself as the Head of State. Enough. So Anne, tell us. What should I tell? Are you studying literature? Yes. In Angoulème? Exactly. How will you do it? Long-distance relationships are difficult. Why the third degree? I'm just curious. Why are you so annoyed? I am not, but... I'm going swimming. Wait for me! Stop, you're going too far out! There is a lot of current. - What's going on? - Go away. Anna, be reasonable. - It's not funny! - I said go away! Have you come to punish me? What is it that you want exactly? Help. That's what I want. You said you would ask around. I did. Liar. If you had told me that you were still... Why didn't you ask me, is it that? When there's fun to be had, You are always there. What can I do about it? I'm not a doctor! So it's my problem? I'll manage on my own. How will you get home? As usual, I'll be fine. I warn you, if you leave now, you will never see me again. I cannot accept the behaviour this afternoon. What will my friends be thinking... Oh yeah, that... Friends are very important... Tell them the truth. I am bored with you. What insolence. Do you think this is how you solve the problems of life? I solve them as best I can. What will you do to... What do you care? Get in. Miss. Miss. Continue. Continue. You can't? No? No. Stand up so we can hear you. Tell me what we just said. What are we talking about? Make an effort. Nothing? Nothing. Nothing to say. Why not? I was not listening. At least she is honest. Now, let me be honest: You might not make it to college. Take a seat. 10 weeks Come on. Get off. What do you want? Follow me. Laetitia will help you. I'll give you a paper, A woman's address, Mrs Rivière. She took care of me. Tell her that "the girl in the paper" sent you. She'll understand. All right. She has experience. That is an advantage. Smile, please. It is also clean. She boils all its instruments. Does it hurt? Yes. The whole procedure. Try to think of something else. The pain will pass. I didn't end up in hospital. It is a lottery. If you are lucky it will be reported as a "miscarriage". But if some bastard doctor should write "abortion", If you don't die, you'll end up in prison. Excuse me, do you have a light? Yes. - Good night. - Thank you, good night. Do you have money? Is it expensive? 40D francs. In advance. I can lend them to you. I'll be fine. It is intriguing. - How much? - Three francs. I'll take that too, for 5. All right. Hi. Is this all your stuff? Yes. Why are you selling it? For a trip. This one? Yes. I'll take it. 50 francs. It's worth more. Hi, am I disturbing you? Who is it? I was given your number. Well? It is urgent. Monday at noon. 3, Pascal Cardinet. Top floor. A beer, please. - What do you want? - The same. Two. Are you alone tonight? Yes. Good thing. Your friends are awful. Not terrible. Frustrated. Everyone here wants the same thing, but they don't admit it. And what do you think? I no longer care what they think. But something is wrong. You look weird. Are you sad? What do you have? Loneliness. Like this? Like this. What do you want? What do you want, Hélène? Last summer, When I was back with my parents, I had an affair with a man. It lasted a month. He was much older than me. We made love, a lot. At his place. In the barn next to the house. Everywhere. As much as we could. I was ashamed, but the desire was stronger than anything. I did not get pregnant. It's a risk, I was just luckier than you. Did you find the address you needed? Look, Brigitte's right. We don't talk about it. It is better. - You won't say anything? - All right. I made you biscuits and apple sauce. Here. 12 weeks Yes? The girl in the paper sent me. Come in. Undress yourself. Here? - Yes. Twelve weeks? Yes. Exactly. You already have a belly. It's hard. Can it still be done? It's borderline, but doable. Do you have the money? Did you bleed a lot when you lost your virginity? I think so. You bleed a lot yes or no? A lot. Some women use bleach. Bleach in the uterus. Then they wonder why they die. You're lucky you found me. Don't make a rumor or scream, or I'll stop. Understood? The walls are too thin. - Did you wash? - Yes, I did. Lay down with your hips on the edge. - Like this? - Lower. It's done. Now don't touch anything. The sooner you feel the wand. You'll get used to it. How long will it take? Less than 24 hours. In the beginning, there will only be a little blood. Then it will come out. Sir? I need to ask you something. Tell me any time. I would like the last lessons. For what? To take the exams. - You're too far behind. - I'll catch up. Why this renewed interest? I couldn't study before. Now I can. Were you sick? The disease that only affects women. Turning them into housewives. Do you still want to teach? No. Why not? It is not the most important thing for me. And what would be instead? I want to write. Thank you. It did not work. I'm sorry. Well? There is nothing to be done. Maybe another wand, but that's not a good idea. The body is reacting badly. There could be complications. If you do, it is at your own risk. - Are you sure? - Yes. What's going on? Leave me alone. Not a word, OK? Okay? Are you there? Get the scissors from my room. I can't. I will not make it. Please. Me? Please... Olivia... Wait, wait. I am bleeding. You are bleeding. Listen, I'm going to get a doctor. You have to go to the hospital. This is not normal. We need help. Stay with me. Look at me. Look at me, please. Hold on. Annel Help! I need help! A doctor, please! It's forAnne! She's in her room. 0h no... Anna! I'm sorry, forgive me. How do I put into the file? Miscarriage. 5th July I am scared. It's time. Good luck. "We defend the honour.
