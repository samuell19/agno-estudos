Leave it out for a day, then refrigerate the kimchi. Ye-sol? Want to have pork stew at my house? Yup. Divorce Agreement I thought about it a lot. Let's think it over. Is it good? Ye-sol, who was that man at your place? My dad. Really? She's here again? Where was he all this time? He returned from making money abroad. Then he must've made a lot. Probably. - Aren't you eating? - I'm eating out. Why didn't he come earlier? Su-ho waited for him. Ye-sol, eat more. Field study? Is Mom going with you? - No, she has to work. - Really? I see. Want to go with me? - Really? - Yes. But the rest will be all moms. No dads will come. I'm fine, but does that make you uncomfortable? No, not at all. Then let's go together. Okay. You come. - Mom can't come anyway. - We're home. - Ye-sol. - Mrs. Kim! - Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - He's director Lee. He heads the support group for the bereaved families. He has something to ask Su-ho's parents. It's for the surviving families. They come to rest, get treated, eat, and chat. - You do so much. - We try. I apologize for coming here suddenly like this. I asked him to come. He came several times before. But Su-ho's mom... - Don't? - It's okay. I'm listening. Mr. Jeong? It's Su-ho's birthday soon. Yes. We'd like to make some food and gather around to chat and stuff on his birthday. I don't understand. We want those who loved Su-ho to come and spend time together. Well... We celebrated birthdays for many kids in Su-ho's class last year. It was sad we couldn't do it for Su-ho. But since you're here this year... What do I say there? Well, anything you like. Anything about Su-ho. Like when he was young. Su-ho was born quite big. Like me. He caused his mom some pain only then. He wasn't a fussy baby at all. He was good. How was he as he grew up? Did he do anything to worry you? Well... Su-ho didn't say much since he was young. He must take after his dad. I've never seen him do anything bad at all. Good, gentle kids can grow up to be mean. We'll come again. May we borrow some of his pictures and things? That room is filled with Su-ho's pictures. Where? In here? Could I take a look? I missed our handsome Su-ho's face. - Here. - Great. Thanks. Tell me about Su-ho? What would you like to know? How old is he in this picture? That's me. Su-ho practically raised Ye-sol. Children! Look at me! Let's move together. Slowly! - Follow the teacher. - Careful! - How many students in total? - Twenty-nine. This way! Don't run! Tell your shoe sizes and get your boots. Help them change into the boots, please. - Size 4! - Size 4! Size 5. What's wrong? May I help you find the right boots? Let's go. Size 4, please. Here. See the tide out far behind me? Yes!

Your friends are waiting. Want to come with me? Please? Come with me? Ye-sol? Want to go in with daddy? Would you like that? Want a piggy back? Good idea.

Copied. - Sign it. - Sign, too? You, too. I won't say. Mommy? Ye-sol. - Did you have fun? - Yes. - Go on inside. - Okay. Take care. - It's okay. - I'll throw it out. Go home. Do you know where? Done. Thanks for today. Don't be. I had fun, too. Ye-sol warmed up to you quickly. By the way, it's Su-ho's birthday soon. So? Some people came by a few days ago. They do things for the kids' birthdays. Just go. I know, but I'm not doing it. You can if you want. - Why not? - No reason! There are things you hate for no reason. It'll be mostly sunny throughout the country today. The morning temperatures will be between 12-15 degrees Celsius slightly lower than yesterday. The air quality for today will be... You stupid! Got an eraser in your head? No, I don't! Ye-sol! Don't cry! Look at the camera and flash the peace sign. One, two, three! Peace! Just once? Please? I'm sorry. Let's do it again. Smile at the camera! One, two, three!

You still drive this car? It sounds bad. When did you get it checked? Get a new car. I'll go with you. How can you say that? Why do you think I drive it? Think I want to? Will you buy me one? Go with me for what? - Hyung-woo? Mom's here. - How've you been? Su-ho's Mom? - Came to see Su-ho? - Yes. Su-ho must be happy. Who's this? - Su-ho's father? - Yes. Nice to meet you. I heard you were overseas. Dear? Meet Su-ho's father. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. Why buy it? You can make it at home, right? - Hello. - Hi. - You made all this? - It's not much. Mrs. Jeong! Wait! Come eat with us before you go. No, it's okay. Come on! We insist. Join us. Come with us, Mr. Jeong. Join us, lots of food here. Su-ho can eat, too. - Let's go. - Come on. This way. Welcome. Have a seat. Here you are. Glad you stayed. - Do you have Su-ho's picture? - Right! - Another friend is here. - Good looking kid. - Give Su-ho some beer, too. - Drink up. Eat lots, kids. They'll have to. Chicken and beer. Their favorite pizza, too! Great! - Poor Hyung-woo there. - Why? - He's upside down. - Then how about this? Now, he's standing! What! - How's this? - Stop! - That's not right. - Really? Leave him. He wanted to take it like that. Give me Su-ho's picture. I want his picture back. Did you come on a picnic? I'm so sorry. She thinks she's the only one mourning? It must be hard on her. Stop it. What about us? Let's eat, folks. Soon-nam! Soon-nam! I'll drive. Soon-nam... About Soon-nam... Ever noticed anything strange? What do you mean? Her personality has changed. Did you notice? What do you mean by strange? She's different somehow... After what happened, it'd be weird if she's fine. That's true. I think you're strange. After going to see Su-ho, you haven't talked about him at all. Why say that now? Mommy! Why are you so late? Were you drawing pictures? Guess what I bought? Clothes! They were on sale at 50% off. What do you think? - Nice. - Isn't it? Eat the fish. I bought it for you. I don't want to. Why? Then don't eat anything. Don't eat! Get up. You heard me. Get out! How can you be picky about food when your brother can't eat! - I'm sorry. - Forget it! Go! Don't eat! Get out! I'm sorry Ye-sol. Mommy was wrong. Two shrimp burgers, one beef burger... - And you? - Shrimp burger. Three shrimp burgers. Three shrimp burgers and one beef burger. Su-ho's birthday party will be in two weeks. And drinks? Do you know him? He's Su-ho's best friend. They were close since elementary school. They went to the same middle school, too. But not high school. Yes. They were best friends. - I didn't order this. - Just take it. By the way, - who's that? - He's Su-ho's dad. It's Mommy. What are you doing? I'll be home late tonight. I have to fill in for someone. Okay. - Eat dinner next door? - Okay. - Come right back home. - Okay. - Mom will be late. - Really? Will you stay for dinner? - Can I? - Yes. I'll make fried eggs. - You know how? - Of course! All done! - Did it bother you? - Not me. I wanted it fixed for Mommy. A praise sticker for what? - I made you fried eggs. - Right. - Where do you want it? - The river. - Is this it? - No! Here! - The river is blue! - It's here. So many praise stickers! Did Mommy give them to you? No, Su-ho did. If I tell, I'll vanish DAD... What are you doing? His passport... It's not stamped at all. Know why he made the passport? I wanted to go to you. But I was scared, so he made it to go with me. Then he studied English at nights to go. Why didn't you come? Go. Stop coming here. Soon-nam... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You have no right to be here. What did you do while everything happened? You call yourself a dad? You tried to carry Ye-sol into the sea? She can't even go into the bathtub! You're no dad! Hello? Yes, I applied for the job. Can you work both day and night? - Yes. - Hello. Then can you start today? Yes, sir. - Two? - Come in! I just stopped by to pick up the picture. The pictures didn't come yet. Come in. Come inside. "Sewol Ferry victims' parents fight to keep memorial classroom." "Are they going overboard?" How can the papers say that? It's not the first time. What agreement? They secretly tried to close it down. Maybe it looks like we're going overboard. How can you say that? Sometimes I think... the other kids will graduate, go to college and get jobs. Then they'll get married. But my Seok-won... I don't want him stuck in that class. Ji-eun might want it closed, too. Students are short on classrooms. But we should preserve it. Don't you agree? Of course, we all agree. We're not saying you're wrong. Where's Bo-im's mom? Food's getting cold. - Call her. - I'll call her. - She won't answer. - Why? I tried. She won't. Then I'll call her. She's not picking up. Do you know why? She's taking the compensation. So she won't take our calls. She can take it. Right. It's her choice. So she'll break ties with us? I'll call till she answers. Yes? Your pictures are here. Why are you so late? - Sorry. Please check. - Count them. Give us two. Four? - One more. - Who didn't get one? You were in Vietnam for long. Yes. I was there for five years. Great English scores. I see the company name, but what was your title there? I ran an aluminum recycling plant. Then why did you come back? Isn't that a prosperous business? Yes, it was. It's not the same with more similar companies there. Was it the company that the locals strike against? That's correct. I see a three-year gap in your resume. There was an accident during the strike. For three years, I proved it was an accident... So where were you? I was in prison. It's all cleared up now. It was found by law as an accident. I was found innocent and released. Thank you. That will be all. Here you are. May I help you? May I get an entry stamp on here? That's not done here. You get that upon entry at immigrations. I know that, but I need it, sir. I can't do it, sir. Please? I beg you. I said I can't, sir. He can't leave the country. Then how can we give an entry stamp? It makes no sense. I have a reason, sir. I don't know your situation, but it's against the rules, sir. You should know. Please leave. No one here will do it because it'll cause problems. - There won't be any problems. - Please go. Please or I'll have to report you. Just once? Please? Just once? - I beg you. - We can't do it, sir. - Please go. - He passed away. Is it so hard to help him with one wish? Who is it, sir? My son. - Pardon? - My son. It's for my son. How hard can it be? It's just a stamp on his passport. I beg you. Please. I'm sorry. I bought strawberries, your favorite. May I come in? What's with the suit? I had a job interview. You wore Su-ho's shoes. They fit? What? They're Su-ho's shoes. They fit fine. They're not mine? Right. You wear size 10. Su-ho wore size 10, too. I went to the airport. They stamped it? I begged them to. What's this? Su-ho's class picture came today. Here. He's tall, isn't he? He shot up in grade 9. This is Bo-im. He lives near here. Lived. His mom has terminal cancer. I heard she took the compensation. It must be hard... They're beautiful. Aren't they? What did you do with the compensation? What? Why are you asking? Because you mentioned it. Why are you curious? I'm not curious at all. Is that why you came? What? Came for the money? - How can you say that? - No? Then why did you come back all of a sudden? Soon-nam! You came for half of your dead son's compensation? Stop it! Are you insane? Memorial service? - Yes. It's in a few days. - $32.40, please. It's good to prepare early, so you don't leave out stuff. Next up. The surviving students of the Sewol Ferry sinking will receive full university scholarships. - Good for them. - What? I wouldn't be happy if I were them. Why? They're getting money. After being on the news like that, people talk. They'll get a ton of comments. Money is better than the brief heartache. It's harder to make money. What do you mean? Anyway, it's so sad. Pass the ball! Over here! Run! Mommy. What are you doing with Su-ho's things? They're for Su-ho's birthday. I told you before. Hello. I'm director Lee Young-joon. - Please just go. - Wait! I didn't say we'll have the birthday party! Stop! How can you do this without permission? We got permission. Su-ho's father said he wanted to do this. Who says he can decide! I don't know why you're doing this, but I don't want it! - Soon-nam! - It's not from the government! Why do stuff like this? You must want something in return! Director. Let's go. Come on. Put them back! Come here for some lotion. - Are you mad at me? - No. Why don't you want Su-ho's birthday party? Last year, we bought a cake and celebrated together. That was nice, too. Sleep. Soon-nam! Why don't you come up? Let's go. It's okay. I was just passing by. Jung-il isn't coming down? He's not home now. He goes fishing a lot these days. I see. Got something to say to him? - I'll tell him. - It's okay. I was rough on him a few days ago. You should see me being rough. You should see me yell! Don't tell him I stopped by. It's your father's memorial service soon. Come with the kids then. He knows he should go, too. See you. Are you hungry? Should we wake Mom? She won't get up. What if she does? What the... Hey! Stop it! Don't wake up Ye-sol. Eun-bin. You left this at the shop. Thank you, sir. I'm going this way, too. The manager asks if you can work dayshifts next week. I work elsewhere during the day, sir. I see. Don't call me 'sir'. We're the same age. You work a lot. Saving up for a trip? Isn't that a travel guide to Vietnam? Why Vietnam? I've been there. I can give you a list of places to eat and stuff. How's Vietnam? Well... It's hot and it rains a lot. The fruit is good. That's it? I went because of Su-ho. Su-ho planned the trip. He wanted to go to Vietnam first because his dad was... Do you know me? I saw you when I visited him at your school. - Su-ho mentioned you... - Do others know, too? The others at the shop? I didn't say anything. You don't know me. Don't follow me. You prepared a lot. Let's begin. It's getting late. I'll heat the soup. Jung-il? - You're back? - Yes. - We were about to start. - Good to see you. - Hello, sir. - Hi. Are you back for good? Yes, I'm staying. That's good. Did you hear from your wife? What? You didn't hear? I told her several times. - Know the college in town? - Yes. It's a hot place to invest these days. I started renting out bachelor pads with him. You should invest, too. Business isn't great in Seoul. How can it be good down there? It's weird. Shut up and stay out, if you don't want to. I'm looking out for my brother. And he doesn't have any money. Sure, he does. I heard the compensation is a lot. That's what I heard. - You got it, didn't you? - Uncle. - How much was it? - Uncle! What? What's wrong with asking that? We're not taking the money. Stop it. Why not? They're offering a lot of money, why not take it? We're just not accepting it! Why are you yelling at me? Then... how will you pay the $60,000 you borrowed? I'll pay. I'll pay you no matter what. So please leave. That little... Let's go. Get up! We're leaving! Your cane! Let's go! Ye-sol? - Want to sleep over at my house? - Okay. Get dressed to go. Hi. Are you sure? Thanks for watching Ye-sol. It was so funny when you fell! Hey! Ready? My turn! Here I go! Oh, man! Your bag! - Thanks. See ya. - Bye. Ms. Soon-nam! I was sleeping so well! Come on. I know you weren't. I saw you turn off the light. You did? Come here. Did you smoke? No! That's crazy. Don't fool me. What's this smell? You know I don't smoke. - Why push me away? - Why smell me? Su-ho? See this? I bought it. Like it? It's cold out at night. Keep warm in this. Like it? Can't you come more often? You love freshly washed blankets. How'd you know? Ye-sol's fine. Are you worried I'm not good to her? I'm trying. And... It's your birthday soon. I'm scared, Su-ho. How can you leave me? Take me with you, Su-ho. Take me with you! Su-ho! Are you okay? Yes. Where are you going? - Not at this hour! - Let go. - Just wait a bit. - No! Her cries are driving me insane! You cried with her at first. So what? Do you want me to keep crying, too? I failed to go to college twice because of her! Su-jin! Is she more important to you than me? - What's with you! - Where will you go? Study hall! Wait. I'll drive you. Soon-nam! Soon-nam. Drink this. Su-ho! It's okay. Mr. Jeong? Get me her medicine beside the microwave? And some water. Soon-nam. Here. Psychiatric Clinic Take this. Are you okay? What are you doing? You're up? - I made some breakfast. - I'm late. I called the store and said you're sick today. Who said you can do that? Would you like some porridge instead? Why do you want to do it? What? Su-ho's birthday? Because I didn't do anything for him. They asked me to say things about Su-ho... But I had nothing to say. Who asked you? Director Lee from the support center. It shouldn't be so hard. But my mind is a blank. I don't even remember Su-ho in elementary school. You were too busy with your job then, too. I don't remember doing anything for him. You can go. I won't stop you from going. Soon-nam. Su-ho will come that day. Don't you think? Happy birthday Su-ho! They're here! Jung-il? - Hello. - Hi. They're here. This way, please. Welcome. We love you Su-ho We love your smile An angel was born on May 14th, 1997 He was born quite big A bright boy Full of curiosity He helped cook Sometimes... He shocked his mom When he was in kindergarten, he wanted to be a police officer When he was in elementary school, he wanted to be a firefighter And he wanted to participate in Olympics as an archer He even wanted to be a racer He went in secret to get his license And passed! What did he love most? Music! Mom said it's hard to make it as a musician, so he played for fun He won medals in sports even in Taekwondo Dad praised him highly from his best friend to a boy who followed him Su-ho was loved by everyone! A handsome, good lad? He takes after his dad Almost twins? Sometimes, he acted up but Su-ho always said 'Yes!' Su-ho's only sister, Ye-sol She loved following him around and played tricks on him Ms. Soon-nam That's what he called mom As dad was away overseas, he was there for her When loved Even more so he loved back Happy birthday Jeong Su-ho Su-ho's friends are here. They wrote about when Su-ho comes to mind the most. I'll read a few. "When a typhoon blows." - Who wrote this? - Me. Will you introduce yourself? I'm Kim Jae-hyun. Why does Su-ho come to mind when a typhoon blows? I was home because of a typhoon, but then Su-ho suddenly came. So what did you do? We went outside together. - We just walked. - Why? Where did you go? Just down a street. Signs and boxes flew all around us. We walked without much thought. How thoughtless! I can imagine you guys walking like that. Who wrote this? "When parkour is called yamakasi." - Woo-chan, from next door? - Yes. What's parkour? - How can we explain? - It's hard. Running around doing stunts in the city. That's parkour? And it's called yamakashi? Yamakashi is a group that does parkour. Because the group is famous, they think it's called that. When people said it's yamakashi, Su-ho corrected them. He did parkour because of Su-ho. Su-ho was like his older brother. He followed Su-ho everywhere. That's true. He tried to dress just like Su-ho. Even down to his socks! That's creepy! - We're here. - Why are you late? - So many people came. - Hi. Hello. - Here. - It's heavy. Why'd you bring so much milk? Su-ho was close with Seok-won and came over often. Whenever he came over, we'd run out of milk. Su-ho is a great kid, who doesn't get the hint, sometimes. Su-ho is so tall, but Seok-won is short. Seok-won is picky and eats slowly. But Su-ho finishes a bowl in just three spoons. Then he asks for more. So I tried to give him a hint. But he didn't get it. Who wrote a letter for Su-ho for today? Hi. Could you read it out loud for us? Yes. Dear Su-ho. I don't know where to begin. I think it was when we were in the same class in grade 5. I knew everything about you, and you knew all about me. I regret not going... when you said you wanted to check out Hongdae. I should've gone. I still listen to the music we used to listen to. I work your part-time job. I write down our memories together so I won't forget. One thing is for sure, you filled seven years of my life. I won't say goodbye. Until next time... I'm just stopping here until we talk again. Mrs. Jeong? I hope you're well. I'm sorry I couldn't go and see you. When I saw you in the street, I avoided bumping into you. I'm not sure why. I should go to you and do something, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. I wanted to say that. To Su-ho and Mrs. Jeong, from Sung-joon. It's okay... Thanks Sung-joon. Chang-hoon's mom? Su-ho is with Chang-hoon... I feel reassured. I'm sure all of you know, Su-ho gave his life jacket to someone else, and jumped back into the water. So I'm... I feel reassured and thankful that he's with my son. Are you okay? Why are you crying? Su-ho... He pushed me up. He pushed... And I grabbed the rope. It was hard to get on the rescue boat. When I finally got on, I thought Su-ho was right behind me... But he wasn't there, and a big wave came... It must've been hard. Thank you for sharing that. How are you doing? I do what I promised with my friends. And what they wanted to do. Mrs. Jeong? Are you okay? I'm not sure. I regret saying I wouldn't do this. I don't have the right to be here. I didn't do anything with the other families. I'm very sorry to all of you. Su-ho called me that morning. I didn't know. He must've called out for me... But I found out much later. Good girl! You're a good daughter. Do you have anything to share about Su-ho? You don't have to if you don't want to. Actually, everything we learned about Su-ho as we prepared this day has been shared with a poet. After his encounters with Su-ho, he wrote a poem for Su-ho's birthday. The poem... Woo-chan? Will you read it? Okay. "Mom? It's me. I went to the trees, fields, and clouds and asked, 'Where is my beloved mom?' Scared, with no idea where I am without you in sight, I couldn't just wait. So I pulled myself together and looked for you. Did you see the front door sensor light flicker on late at night for no reason? Don't be scared. It was me, Mom. Now, I pass by invisibly. I eat invisibly. And I hug you invisibly. I hold you tight not to lose you again. That's when the light flickers on. Didn't Dad arrive from abroad for my birthday today? I visited him. Since you can't lean on my shoulders now, and I'm not there for Ye-sol, I asked Dad to return and hug you and Ye-sol tight. If he didn't come yet, don't worry. Dad will be back soon. I love you my love, Ms. Soon-nam. My dear, sad mom... I miss you so much, Mom." Su-ho... Su-ho came to me. Since his mom and Ye-sol are here, he asked me to go home. Every night... Su-ho came to me. Are you coming to the airport? Of course. Protect them when I'm gone. Ms. Soon-nam? And Ye-sol. Hey! Ye-sol, you're back? Hi, Mom. Where's Dad? In the balcony. Wash up first? Dad? - Back from school? - Yup. - Was it fun? - No. School should be fun. - Ye-sol! Wash up! - Wait. What did you do at school? I studied and went to the library. - Played with friends? - Oh, I did. - What did you play? - Jackstones. - Played a game? - Yup. - Are you good with jackstones? - A bit.
