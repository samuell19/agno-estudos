Great. We needice units more. Titanium. It weighs nothing . Vitaly Petrovich. Excuse me. We need hundred of it. Give orders, I'll reserve. Do it. Can I call? It's me. I'll be late a little bit. I'm going . I thought everything over. I'm going . This talk is senseless. Do you smoke? You too, I see. No. I just collect bright things. Who is it in your car? Our collaborator. You have a great labour fluidity on your work. The requirements are high. By the way, she is just like my boss. Marsell Marso. Show your tongue. Wow, it is terrifying . Give it. My new job. By the way, we don't notice that a genius lives with us. What do you say? Does it become me? Yes, it does. We have to settle one question. Did anybody change his mind? It's not late now, you have the time to refuse. Gennady? What are you talking about? We'll follow you, master. Volodya? Everythingis ready. The beard, the guitar. Rita? Sasha? I'll go. In this case: strick discipline. Absolute subjection to me as a superior. In any circumstances. An they can be very unexpected . Vitaly? How do you do, my friend? How are you? Mountain climbers? Get acquainted, boys. Good afternoon. How do you do? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My son. Come. Let's go. Please. Vitaly, you did very good by cominghere. Thank you. This is our old house. My forbears have been living here for 300 years. What is it with you? When somebody dies, lobio is cooked . A lot of people come. Please. One minute. Vessarion, we can't drink. Vitaly! Your arrival. Thank you. For this house. This is our custom. Please. Who is it? Your son? Iligo, the eldest. This is Artao our peak. Do you like it? How didit turn out to be here? He has perished here a year ago. Has he broken away? I doubt. Nobody knows. It seems to be an avalanche. Probably an avalanche. He is a strong guy. He can't be called physical strong . That's another. Understand . The sense is in that another. This is my elder son. Take it as a keepsake. You remind me of my son. God save you. Thank you. Dear guests, eat, please. You are welcome to whatever we have. Don't be shy. Sonny, give here a pig . Our house is your house. Vitaly, why are you sitting like a guest? You are owner. The pig is very tasty. You have a long way ahead . It's bad that you can't drink much. Unfortunately, we can't drink at all. In generall, you can. So much. Excuse me, please. We've just climed on the top of the tower. Wonderful. 500 years for all that. What? Nobody can occupy this place in the house. Exuse me, please. Not at all. Truly. I did n't know. I'm sorry. Sit here, you'll be very comfortable. Do you go on Artao too? I'm a doctor and I stay on Belak. That's too much. What are you looking at? Do you like this girl? I do. That's my daughter. A daughter? Yes. She is Russian. She was left alone when Germans was advancing in 1 94 2. Andi have carried her over the pass. Did you wage war? How old are you? I don't know. I was 4 7 or. . . before the war. Probably, I'm older now. Am I an old man? A young man. This horn is always drunk for good people. Andi would like to drink for my guests. For mountain climbers. Mountain climbers never search for a profit. They find their happiness in the mountains. Their pride. You told me that you could not drink. I know it. But we have to drink a glass in order to wish you good luck. Successful return. Be healthy, my friends. Where are you taking me, Vessarion? To my old age. Let's go. You're telling me that I'm hale and hearty andi'm taking you here. You think that Vessarion completely. . . I'm listening . My family is buried here. My grandfather, my great grandfather, my nother, my father. My youngest son is buried here. I have brought him from Kaluga in 1 943. It was hard but I had managed . Everyone must be buried in his homeland . Vitaly, I want you to know. I'm not going to die. But it would be easier to me if my belovediligo were here. Attention, radio station ''Earth''. I'm ''Avalanche''. Tuning . One, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. ''Earth'', I'm ''Avalanche''. Who is ''Earth''? Artao. Lomov's group. Finally, the old man has decided . Will it be for the last time? He tells it every year. Risky venture. Difficult. Even Iliko did n't reach it. They have a good chance. This guys are strong . ''Earth'', I'm ''Avalanche'', I hear good . Report where you are and when you begin the route. I'm ''Avalanche''. Everythingis clear. We are at the base camp. Everythingis all right. Tomorrow we begin the peak assault. Got it? Breathe. Don't breathe. Breathe out. Why are you gloomy? Am I ill? Quite the contrary, we can become unemployed working with you. Having such a doctor I'm able to afford such a luxury like fracture. You're so obliging . So, all your work will be ahead . Better it won't. Do you want me to give you a peak? What for? Sasha, she does not need our peak. Nobody needs it except us. How long shall we wait for you? We'll run for it quickly and come back. But nobody've been there. It has to resig n this time. Will you miss us? Is it necessary? This wouldinspire me. You're so self confident. No, I'm afraid of you. You're absolutely healthy and can run on your Everest. Be careful, please. I'll be worried about you. Thank you. Vitaly Petrovich. Sasha! Wait for me. Wonderful view. Go? Let's go. Stupid boys. And what is the topic of your degree work? This is very complex. About the acclimatization of sportsmen on high altitudes. But this is very important question at the present moment. In the connection with the forthcoming games in Mexico. I would like to check you at the moment of the biggest overloads. Let'so go upward with us. No. I'm afraid . Front? Yes, 1 94 2. In this region. And this? This is a rope. Breathe in. Listen to me attentively. We must pass through the icefall tomorrow. This is difficult. The first attempts to take Artao were finished always here. We'll be keeping to the left, the ice house isn't very torn here. We have to avoid the avalanches only, they get off the walls sometimes. The first passing the night is at the end of the ice house above. After that the wall. . . Ok, let's continue. This is the most complicated place. We must be especially attentive here. Iliko has perished somewhere here. We'll hard ly get over the wall in a day. We should n't think about the convenient lodging for the night. We shall reach the plateau under the peak on the third day at best. And where is the peak? It is not seen from here. That snow above the wall is the beginning of raising to it. We'll leave here tent and backpacks and travel light to the peak. And what is a descent there? Easy. A little bit rocks and snow. And we'll come from here over this cross piece. Over there. Volodya, the radio communication will be after two passings the night in the morning andin the evening . Rockets are for the insurance. The white one means ''everything is all right''. The red one. . . We'll try not to use the red one. Probably there won't be any radio sig nal from that peak. In general it is calm there. Clear. There is a see on the other side of the pass. Let's go with me. We'll be there in two days. It's not the time to speak about it. We'll continue the conversation after my return. We'll see. What a high wall. What is the height? 4 50 meters. That is higher than the Moscow University. Two Universities. Exactly two. Awful. And will you climb there? Ask about the salary for this. Ok, guys, let's have a rest. There is four working days ahead . We start early, at three o'clock. If you want to test a friend . If you can't make him out. Is he good or bad? Risk takinghim in the mountains! Don't leave him alone. Let him go in the bunch with you. And you will understand who he is. If he is not goodin the mountains. If he became limp and went down, took a step on the ice house and drooped, stumbled and screamed . It means that a stranger goes besides you. Don't quarell with him, send him away. Don't take him upwards And don't sing about him. If he did n't whimpered and moan. If he was gloomy and angry but he kept going . And he groaned but held when you fell from the rocks. If he went next to you like in battle. And he stood tipsy on the peak. It means that you can rely upon him like upon yourself. If he went next to you like in battle. And he stood tipsy on the peak. It means that you can rely upon him like upon yourself. ''Earth'', I'm ''Sky''. Answer me. ''Earth'', I'm ''Sky''. Hear good . We are at the first passing the night besides the wall. Everythingis fine. We won't use the rockets. Define the weather forecast more precisely. Volodya, what about the forecast? Got it, I hear good . I communicated with the base, the weather is fine. What about the mood? What about the peak? Volodya, ask about the health. The doctor is interested about your health. Give it to me. Tell him that I'm calling the doctor. Gennady is calling the doctor. Take it. I'd like to consult with you. I have a strange symptoms. Sleeplessness, the absence of appetite, giddiness, distraction. What will you say? The mountain sickness. No, doctor, I'm not exposed to the mountain sickness. And now when we are divided by hundreds of meters, when my life is in extreme danger. . . Let me explain him. Wait. I have nothing more to ask you. You've heardit, silly. Don't block up the ether. Finishing . Bye bye. Googluck, Othello. He is too weak for Othello. Filling up the list? Boys, look. The mysterious sig n. What is it? Grievances, everyone. . . Tea is ready. It is light by them. The mountains are so wonderful. Whay are you not with them? Four people are the most suitable group for such a wall. Two bunches. Two people in a bunch. Rerfect. The did n't take you. Did n't take. How many pieces of sugar? Four pieces. Much sugar is harmful. Andit destroys the aroma of tea. Why are you teaching me? Why did you climb here? To see you. The strong and the courageous. Because there are lot's of talks. They say ''The clever one won't go uphill''. And others. ''Mountaineeringis the sport of the courageous''. And whom do you listen? Both of them. And what will you say? About what? About it. You mean, benefits? Not benefits. What is it for you? It is pleasure for me. Lessening of tension. It tickles the nerve. Andit is beautiful. Ok. You are falling from the rock, breakinghands andribs. It's not a pleasure. Andi can't find beauty in it. We're talking the different languages. What for did Amunson need the South Pole? And what for did Tensin climb the Everest? A man's seeing the pole and climbing the highest did n't bring any profit to humankind . But people themselves announce the heroes. There is a passion in a man. To submit, to surmount. To surmount obstacles. I understandit so. If I live in the other country, I don't know the language. Andi try to learn it in order to to surmount obstacle. But you can go arund the mountain. For what do people create the obstacle artificial? Like running with barriers. Don't forget that mountaineeringis sport. You pretend to somethinglarger. Everybody forgets Its own offences. And my sorrow doesn't melt Like eternal snow. It doesn't melt on summer In midday heat. I know that I have to carry this sorrow All my life. No, you judge too monotonous about life. And the obstacles you talking about are in one flatness. Horizontal. The knew, unknown features of character appear in the mountains. Features of character, of soul. He lives in another dimension. Vertical. The central radio station of North Caucasus is speaking . The central radio station of North Caucasus is speaking . Attention to the organizations workingin the mountains, tourists and climbers beingin the mountains. How long do they broadcast? Two hours, every 10 minutes. What about the broadcast with Ortava? It is not available. The storm. The strong thunder hindrances. We have to warn the group as soon possible. It'll be the broadcast now. I'm going to try once more. Maybe they'll recieve it. It's a pity. They, probably, under the peak. ''Earth'', I'm ''Avalanche''. Listen to me attentively. The front of cyclone is coming . The rescue service chief's order is to leave the route. Got it. When did you recieve this message? At 20 : 00? ''Avalanche'', I'm ''Earth''. Volodya, somethinghappened? Guys are being come off the route. Why? Cyclone is coming . What will be with us? Nothing . We are below. Did you tell them? The broadcast is in the evening . Poor guys. They were preparing, waiting . Can it be done once more? Next year. The vacations are coming to the end . Perfect area. A tent can be placed . Look, a nest. We can cook fried eggs. Alpine bird . A very rare bird . Only several nests are known. What is it? Look. Alpine bird . A good place for spending the night. It is early yet. We can go. Sasha, you're crazy. The place is good but occupied . Let's respect the young naturalists. Our Timiryazev. Brem, most likely. Darvin. Don't drivel. I'll drop a stone on you from above. You felt sorry for a bird but not for a man. ''Sky'', I'm ''Earth''. Do you hear? I can't understand where they passing the night. Right above the wall. Where the snow is. On that tiny place? One man can't stay there. It seems so. The plateau is 200 meters wide. Rocket! The white one. For what do people take the portable radio if they don't use it? They are too lazy to crawl out of tent and turn the radio on. What shall we do? We shall wait the morning broadcast. But if it won't be? They'll start going down in the morning . Nothing will happen by night. They have a splendid passing the night. ''Sky'', I'm ''Earth''. Do you hear? ''Sky'', I'm ''Earth''. Do you hear? Don't they answer? ''Earth'', I'm ''Sky''. Volodya, I hear you. Everythingis fine. We have stayed too long at the wall and missed the broadcast. We are on the plateau. Five hours from the peak. Starting the assault. Got it? Got it. We'll do so. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I finish the broadcast. Finish. And what? They are in a hurry. They are going down. They won't go at the peak. Everything goes to waste. Sure. They have passed the most difficult place, the wall. And what? They did n't reach the peak. You are happy about it. Because I'm envious. And what? It's all right, we can go. Please to take your places at the table. Let's do it quickly. The weather forecast is reliable. The forecasts can be trusted on the next day. What shall we do with the tent? We'll leave it. We'll be back soon. Fortify it. Shall we take the backpacks? No. We'll take one in case of special emergency. Take the feather beds. It won't be hot. This is not a plain. There's another climate here. An avalanches go one after another. A rockfalls go one after another here. We can turn off in order to go round the precipice. But we choose the hardest way which is dangerous like the warpath. We can turn off in order to go round the precipice. But we choose the hardest way which is dangerous like the warpath. The one hasn't tested himself if he had n't been here and had n't risked his life. Even if he grabed the stars from the sky. You won't see below a tenth part of such beauty and wonders during all your happy life. You won't see below a tenth part of such beauty and wonders during all your happy life. There are no scarlet roses and funeral ribbons. And the stone which gave you eternal rest doesn't seem like monument. And the peak unconquered by you shines by emeraldice like Eternal flame in the morning . And the peak unconquered by you shines by emeraldice like Eternal flame in the morning . Let them say. But nobody perishes for nothing . It relieves vod ka and chills. The others will come and change the cosiness with the risk and excessive work. They'll go by the route unfinished by you. The others will come and change the cosiness with the risk and excessive work. They'll go by the route unfinished by you. The steep walls. Keep your wits about you ! Don't put your trust in the luck here. Neither stone nor ice nor rock are reliable in the mountains. We rely only on stronghands, on friend's hands and hammered piton. And pray for insurance to hold . We rely only on stronghands, on friend's hands and hammered piton. And pray for insurance to hold . We're hewing the stairs. Not a step back! The knees are trembling from the effort. And the heart is eager to run from the chest to the peak. All the worldis clearly visible. You are dumb from the happiness and envy a little those people who will climb the peak later. All the worldis clearly visible. You are dumb from the happiness and envy a little those people who will climb the peak later. Sasha! He doesn't breathe. A strong shock. He needs warmth. I'll take him. Help me. Where is the tent? It must be somewhere here. It is blown off. We have to dig the cave. The cave? We must go down. Downwards, quick. Or we will die here. I'll take him. Hurts? Good . Become unfrozen. Be patient or you'll lose the hands. The doctor will have a work now. Never mind . The first category. Rub yourself. Be careful. Don't tear off the skin. He has a fever. Is it all what we have? That's all. Not very much. He is a poor eater, he has to drink. We'll make ends meet. We're going at the camp, home. Decided to go? Rescue team will arrive in five days only. We have no broadcast. How is he? Become unfrozen. Take the mittens, we shall go now. Maybe it will drop towards morning . Hard ly. Take it. Take the one. You'll sit and we'll go. We'll go quicker if we freeze. And how! Where shall we go? Where are we? In the cave. What is it with me? We've got into storm. Calm down, you're ok but you should n't move. When did the guys go away? Two hours ago. I've melted snow for you. Do you want to drink? Have we taken the peak? Yes, we have. We lost the way. How long do we go? Six hours. Let's go upper along the rocks. I can't. That's all. How you can't understand . The guys are waiting for us. Andi can't. Go alone. Still, you'll go. No. You will go. Leave me alone. Stand back! Stop! Where are you going? Are you crazy? Where is your spectacles? Is it light? I can see nothing . Gena, calm down. I can't see. It is dark. This is snow blind ness. It will pass off. You know. Stand up. I'll lead you. Rita? What, Sasha? It's hard to breathe. What's the time? I'll have a look. Became damp. There's no air. Don't you feel it? We are strewn. Lie down. I'll try to dig out. Sasha. Hands. Painfully? Vitaly Lomov? Vitaly? Don't worry, I hold you. Let's have a rest. Lomov, is it dark now? Still a day. Lomov? A tent? Have we come back to our tent? Let me. Sit here, Gena. Whose is this tent? There's a primus stove here. Petrol? Probably. Let me. Try to kind le. I'll be pumping . Here. Where? Here. I'll be pumping . We have to kind le it. We have to kind le it. We have to kind le it. I'll be working till morning . Give me the matches. You have them. Here. I can't take out. Who is it? Iliko. He left a message. ''I've almost reached the peak. I've broken my leg on the crest. Snow storm. Nobody will find me. I can hold out a day more. I have nothing to open the tinned goods.'' A frost killed him too. He was alone, we are together. Work. Keep working ! Work. Work. Don't sleep. Don't sleep, you'll freeze to death. I dreamed about a hot bath. A good end . Leave it. It was standing all year long . It will hold . He was a good mountain climber. A primus stove will go out soon. We shall go. It's time. Artao is ours for all that. Memorize the place. I've memorized . We'll come back here. Go alone. Stop it. I'm talking about it. That will be quicker. They believe in us. Maybe you are right. Ok. I'll leave you here. Don't move. Wait. Vitaly. I have to tell you. This cyclone, I was warned about it. I did n't tell you. What for? I don't know. I have to go. Do you understand what I told you? Later. It's not the time now. Wait, I'll be back soon. Not quite myself. We warned them. I wonder where they are. They are sitting out. They are waiting till the cyclone is over. They are sittingin a tent, telling the anecdotes. Anecdotes are good during the snow storm. Something can happen. Perhaps. And we're sitting and doing nothing . What can you suggest? You have to suggest. I suggest to sleep. What's that? The avalanche. Like the war began. The rockfall avalanches are the weapon of mountains. The sunset twinked like blade's shine. Death countedits spoils. A battle will be tomorrow. A platoon buriedin the clouds and went away through the pass. Put aside the talks. Forward and up. . . This mountains are ours. They will help us! They will help us! A German guy and you were climbing this slope before the war! He felt down but was saved . And maybe he is preparing his machine gun for the battle now. Put aside the talks. Forward and up. . . This mountains are ours. They will help us! They will help us! You are here again, you are precise. You are waiting for a cherished sig nal. And that guy, he is here too. Among the riflemen from ''Edelveis''. They must be thrown off the pass! Put aside the talks. Forward and up. . . This mountains are ours. They will help us! They will help us! Watch, what is it there? Larisa! Where are the others? Drink! When is the broadcast? At 20 : 00. In 1 5 minutes. Tell the headquarters. ''Sasha was striked by the lightning . He is alive'' They will be here towards morning . Rescue team, a doctor. Gena! Gena! Gena! Oh my God . Good afternoon, doctor. Hands. Here is the work for you. Everythingis good . You've won. We are coming back in the vanity of cities andin the streams of cars. We have nowhere to go! And we are going down from the conquered peaks. And we are leaving our heart in the mountains. So leave the need less quarrels! I've already proved myself that only the mountains which you had n't visited can be better than the mountains you've been to. The mountains which you had n't visited . Who wants to stay alone in the trouble? Who wants to go away without hearing the heart's call? But we are going down from the conquered peaks. But the gods were going down on earth too. So leave the need less quarrels! I've already proved myself that only the mountains which you had n't visited can be better than the mountains you've been to. The mountains which you had n't visited . A mountains rouse lots of our words and hope songs and topics. And they ask us to stay. But we are going down. Someone going down for a year, someone completely. Because we have always to come back. So leave the need less quarrels! I've already proved myself that only the mountains which you had n't visited can be better than the mountains you've been to. The mountains which you had n't visited .
