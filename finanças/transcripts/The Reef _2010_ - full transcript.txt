Hello, mate! - Ah, it's good to see you. - You too. - How are you? - Great. Luke, this is my girlfriend Suzie. Suzie, Luke. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. And you know my sister, Kate. - Kate. - Luke. - Looking good. - Thanks. - I'll take that. - Thank you. Okay. Wow, you really bought a car?! Nah. See, after our sale, we could have delivered the boat to Indonesia. We're not keeping you from delivering, are we? Nah, it's all good. I can't believe you get to sail around the world delivering boats for a living. How fantastic! Go introduce yourselves to Wazza. He's the scruffy looking one, fishing off a yacht. - Cool. - See you soon. - So, how've you been? - Good. - Good, and you? - Yeah, good. I'm gonna get some spark plugs. You wanna come? Sure. - Shane. - Hey. - Is Lou there? - Yeah, he's just out the back. Hey, Lou? Yeah, out here. - Pretty impressive, eh? - Yeah. A mako, tiger, hammerhead... ...and that one's a white pointer. - Where's you get these? - Out there. - Here? - Yeah. Strange about the white pointer though. People reckon they don't usually come this far North. Don't worry. What do they say? You're more likely to die from a bee sting than get killed by a shark. - Wazza. - Hey. Kate... Kate, Warren. - Hi. - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. - Welcome aboard. - It's not bad. She's a bit scruffy, but she'll do. Right... I'll show you where you're sleeping. This brings back memories. This is yours. Hey, so... I brought you something. I wonder what this could be. Thank you. I've really missed you. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Is there someone else? - No, there's nobody else, it's just... You wanted a break, and now you're back. Matt really wanted me to come on holiday, and it sounded like a good idea. So, that's what this is, it's just a holiday? Yeah... Yeah, I'm here for the holiday. Okay... Good! I'm gonna go up, and catch the outgoing tide. Okay. Oh, wow! Did you just catch that? Yep. These waters are full of them. Cool. - Are you in from Sydney? - Yeah. My brother and his girlfriend are here from London. - And you're crewing with Luke to Indonesia? - Yeah. - Have you crewed with him before? - Nope... No, this is the first time. I usually work the fishing boats. Thought I'd try something different. You've crewed with him though, haven't you. How do you know that? He talks a bit about you. Yeah... Yeah, we sailed the Mediterranean together. Well, we're off. - So, where are we heading? - Cygnet Reef. I wanna try and get there by this afternoon. Sounds great! What's there?? You'll see. We're here. Bye! Have fun! See you soon... Sorry. You okay? Yeah. Follow me. - How's that? - Amazing. - Is this your favorite spot? - I've never been here before. - Wanna go for a bit of an explore? - Yep. Look what I found. It's beautiful. What? I don't know. Is this just sex, or is it something else? I don't know. You know what I think? That you're scared. - Scared? - Uh huh Scared of what? Me. You. Us. No, that's not it What is it then? I dunno. - Come on, Kate! - I don't know! One minute we're having a good time, and now we're not. - I'll tell you what I think. - I don't really care what you think. Hey, Luke, Kate!... There's something up with Warren. Luke! The tide's dropping really fast. We hit bottom. Kate, can you keep an eye on it? I think it's leaking. Eh?! - We're scraping. - I know, the tide came up really fast. I tried the engine. It won't start. - Try now? - Nothing. - And now? - No, nothing. Jump on the anchor. Kate, you hoist the sail? The channel's opened up. Okay, I think we're out of trouble. Thanks, guys. Hey, Wazz? Take a look at that engine, yeah? Katie, steer? Keep her straight, yeah. Yeah, just keep it straight. So... who wants a go? Suze? Me? Yeah, come on. It's the chance of a lifetime. Two hands. Good! Sailing. Arrr... Arrr! Thought I'd come up and catch the morning. It's gorgeous. I'm really sorry about yesterday. Yeah. Me too. It's tricky, isn't it? Yeah. You don't have any doubts about us? Plenty... It's just, you know... I really missed you. I really missed you too. - You hungry? - Starving. - Brekky? - Yes, please. Matt! Warren! You alright? We've gotta get out of here. She's gonna go down! Where's Matt? Matt?? Matt?! Mattie?! Warren?! - You alright? Let's get out of here now! We've gotta get out! Follow me. Take a deep breath. Where's Matt? Matt?? Where's Matt?! Here! I'm here! It's stuck! Matt here. - Okay. - Follow me. - You alright? - Yeah. Are you okay? Let's get out of the water. Yeah... Yeah, sure. We're gonna have to push you. Okay... 1, 2, 3. Up you get. Alright, who's next? You got me? Okay... more hands. - Alright, Suze? - Yeah. Fuck. Look at that. The heel's been ripped off. It's okay. You alright? - What happened? - I don't know. We must have hit something. A reef? Or a whale? The bulkhead's are fucked. Okay, guys. I don't think we should stay here. There's a current. We're drifting further out to sea. The boat's fucked. I don't think it's gonna stay afloat. And when we do sink, we're in the water, just further from land. - It might not sink. - Well, is there an EPIRB? - What's an EPIRB? - It's a distress beacon. - Yeah, there is... - Yeah, but it's an old one, so... You need a plane to fly over to get a signal. We're not on a flight path. Well, how do you know that? Seen any planes in the last few days? Okay, I'm not saying we should try and swim to the mainland, but I reckon we can make it to the little island. No. - What are you doing? - Point 12 at the sun, put the angle between the 12 and the hour hand... That's North. So... We're here, right? Turtle Island's here. Now, we won't go straight there, because there's a reef... here, but with the current... I reckon if we swim North we'll hit the island. How far will we have to swim? 10... 12 miles. Good luck. I fish these waters, mate. I know what's out there. I'm not getting in that water. What makes you think they're not gonna come here? I mean, there's all sorts of shit starting to rot down there. I don't wanna argue with you, mate. Honestly, I don't... I just... I'm not getting in the water. Alright, look. Yeah, there might be sharks. I don't know. What I do know is, that there is land over there. The longer we sit here, the further we get away from it. We either swim for it, and try and save ourselves, whilst we've still got enough strength, or we can stay here, and hope doesn't sink. And that someone comes for us. But they better come soon, 'cause otherwise we'll die of dehydration. I'm not a great swimmer. I don't think I could swim that far. Yeah, me neither. Okay. Alright... I'll go down below and see what I can find to keep us afloat. You need a hand? Yeah, if you're in the water, I'll pass out whatever I find, yeah? You okay? Yeah. Here goes... Luke! Luke!! Luke! Where are you?! Luke, there's something in the water! It's a shark! Luke, come on! Come up! Luke! Something broke the surface. Over there. - Well, what was it? - I don't know, but it was big. Alright... Well, I've still gotta find the EPIRB, so unless you see a really big shark, don't warn me. I'll see you soon. - Are you alright? - Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine. You found it. You know how to kick it off? It's good, mate. Okay, great. Try it on. - For you. - Thanks. What's the matter? You look like a seal in that. Sharks love seals. Mate, you don't want to count that your business. Don't go scaring anyone else, alright? Maybe we should wait. Okay, it's your choice. Look, this is a difficult decision. It's really easy not to get found out here. This boat's gonna sink... and it's gonna sink soon. There's land over there, and that's where I think we should be going. I'm going with Luke. Me too. This is for you. There you go. Take that. That's yours. I'm not going. What? I'm gonna stay here. It's a better option than staying on the boat. What, swimming to an island you can't see? Kate. Okay. Okay, that's for you. Thanks. Are you sure about this? Yeah. We'll send someone as soon as we can. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yep. See you, mate. See you soon. - See you back there. - Definitely! What are you doing? You know he knows the ocean more than any of us. Come on, come with us. I can't. I just... I just can't. - See you later, sis'. - Bye. Okay, let's go. - You look after her for me, okay? - I will. Don't worry. I'm good. Okay? So, let's stick together. Don't want anyone to get tired, so if we stick to a steady pace, we'll get there, yeah? Apart from that, relax and enjoy. It's once in a lifetime. Let's go. Hey, guys! - Not so much splashing. - Did you see something? No. Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, I'm gonna come with you! Come on, come with us. No. Are you sure? Yeah. No, you go. I'll be alright. This is nuts. - I hope you're right about this. - You're not the only one. Guys, don't worry. We'll make it. We'll get there. Here, take this. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's alright. We'll share this one. Thanks. Hey, guys. We're tired. Let's try to focus our energy, eh? Imagine as we go, and a huge wave's pulling us towards the island. Or towards my bed! There's always a last resort. What's that? When I'm at the gym, and I'm trying to break through the pain barrier, I imagine... having sex. While you're doing weights, you're imagining you're screwing?! Not just screwing! There's foreplay as well! Well, isn't there? Not often! What! Don't listen to her. Shit. What was that? What? What is it? I can't see anything. I think it's a school of small fish. - Well, what are they doing? - I don't know. Okay... Let's keep going. Come on. What is it? It looks like a shell. - It's a turtle's shell. - Yeah, I think you're right. A turtle? Hey, Matt? Mattie? Let's get the fuck out of here! Come on, Suze. Hey... We can't stay there. Come on. I don't wanna stretch my legs out. I really don't. - I can't. - Okay, it's alright. Listen... We've gotta go, so do you want me to go behind you? Yeah, I'll go behind you. Yeah? I've got you. Okay? - You okay? - Yeah. That was a big turtle. - And dead? - Yeah. What was that? What? Over there. I saw something. I can't see anything. The sea's really freaking me out. What's the matter? - There's something here! - We have to keep going. - There's something following us! - Suze, this is the ocean. There's a million things out here, but we've got to keep going. It is okay. Come on. Here we go, alright. It's alright. There! - Alright, Suze, listen ... - I'm sure I saw something, and it's big! - Okay, so what did you see? - I don't know! There! Look! I can't see anything. Over there. - You saw something? - I don't know... maybe. I told you! What was it? - Was it a shark? - I don't know, okay? Let's keep going. Okay. Well it's a shark. - How big? - It's big. Stay together! I can't see it. Oh, God! Stay together! Can you see it? I think it's gone. I can see the fin. Let's go. We've gotta go this way. This way. Good. I can't see it. I can't see it. It must have moved away. It's okay. I can't see it. Okay, Suze? I can't see it. It's okay. It's okay. You must stay calm. Stay focused. All is okay. Take some deep breathes with me. Come on. It's alright. It's not going to get you. It's not gonna get us. Deep breathes. It's gonna be alright. Deep breathes... That's it. That's it. Matt. Matt! Hey, Mattie? Matt!! Matt!! Matt!! Mattie!! Matt!! Matt!! Matt!! Mattie!! Matt!! There he is! No, go! Go! My fucking leg's gone! Go! Go! You got it? My leg's gone! You got it? You've gotta go! You've gotta leave me! Swim! I'm useless to you! You've gotta go! He's gonna... - He's gonna come back! - Look at me. Quick! Before he... Quick. Before he... Mattie? Matt? Mattie? Matt? Matt. Come on, wake up! Wake up. Please! Wake up! Come on. Come on! Matty, wake up! Wake up, please! Katie! Katie, get out of there now! Oh, God! Oh, I love you! Katie! Come on! Come on. Push. Did you say something? No. You did, you said something. It's gonna come back, isn't it? Isn't it? Didn't you say we'd be there in 3 hours?! How are we gonna get there now?! We're lost, in the middle of the ocean! In the middle of the fucking night! I never should have listened to you! We should have stayed on the boat with Warren! And now Matt's dead! And soon we're gonna be too! - We're fucked! We're so fucked!! - Suzie! I'm sorry about Matt. I'm sorry about all of this. Luke, it's not your fault. It's not your fault! You didn't make us come with you. It'll be alright. It's alright. Okay? It's alright! What was that? Come together. Come together! Oh my God, we're gonna die! Oh God... Somebody help us! Hey. Hey. Look. Hey... Suze... Look. Okay. Be careful, eh? It's very sharp. - It's so good to get out of the water. - Yeah. That's not Turtle Island, but it's land. Let's keep going then. I'm so sore. Me too. What? I don't know. Get back! It's a fucking dolphin! We're moving pretty fast. The current must have picked up. Finally, the current's helping! Is that the dolphin? Suzie! Suzie! Suzie!! Oh, fuck... It's okay. Come on. Oh my God... Poor Suzie. It's the same one, isn't it? I think so. It is. I know it is! There's another reef. I think we should go. Luke. Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!! Come on. Come on! Come on, Luke! Come on. - Come on. Let's go. - I can't! - Are you okay? - Yeah. My foot is bleeding. Oh, shit. Sorry. Thanks. It's okay. I love you, Luke. I love you too. You ready? No. Me neither. Let's go. Swim! Fucking swim! Climb out! Go! Go! I can't do it! Go! Go! Pull me up! Pull me up! Take me! Take me! Pull me up! Pull me up! I can't! Pull me up! Luke!! Luke!! Luke!! Luke!! Luke! Please come home! Please come home! Please... come home! No!! No!!
