Should we begin? This is the place you have one unheard message first unheard message jay this is dr meyers would you do me a favor and stop by my office when you get in. We've had a patient on our floor I'd like to refer you to she is serving a suspended sentence with voluntary commitment we've had some luck with dialing in her medication that said I think she would benefit from some counseling with you so let's talk in the AM end of message to delete this message- can we open this? Yeah. A glass of wine sounds good um I'll take care of all this, then get to the rest where do you think we should start where do you want to start? How about why dr meyers thought you should see me instead of her? She's sick of me? Well our jobs are very different she's a doctor she's used to writing prescriptions I talk to people I listen I want to hear from you. But you should know I did ask that you be referred to me I'm interested in you. I'm interested in what I saw on your file hey Um... I'll give you some time to get settled in. Okie oh. You're awake you feeling any better, hon? What? What is it? Oh... no... no... why do you have vodka under your desk? I had to ask a patient earlier today to leave that behind alcoholics is that your normal thing well I certainly see my fair share of them is that what you want to discuss my practice how long have you been a doctor? I'm not a doctor I'm a licensed counselor isn't that worse I came to this work because I was once in a place much like this one, okay? I like to think that I have a rapport with people. Just like you I don't like being forced to see doctors but now you're cured? Well we'll go with that. If you and I can talk-really talk and get through this initial evaluation today then I plan to talk to dr kovac about rolling back some of your medications even though I'm crazy? Tell me all about it so you think this place will do? We'll see what's for dinner? Soup and fruit salad. What do you think? Sounds good. Gourmet. Ah you like to cook? Sometimes. You? Not really so how does it feel to be out of there? Really good good. Good. Hey. Cheers to you seriously? It's nothing psychoactive. I promise but what are they? Just some vitamin supplements. I want you to get healthy so your first meal since we got out of there how does it feel? I feel a little sick actually not really hungry I think there's still a lot of medication in my system I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? No I feel guilty eating by myself don't. Okay it's gonna be it isn't it? I think so it's hard to tell all the elements are right you said it's happened up here before that these mountains are some kind of hot spot or something right? Uhuh they have music I haven't heard a song in months we should dance. Oh... yeah! We can move the table out of the way just for like two minutes.. So nice to be here with you I will have to be so drunk for that for that... then finish your wine... for you. Two minutes, that's all. Ok who knew you could dance like that? I got moves. What about you shakin' that thing? Hey you know how I feel about you don't you? Yeah I do yeah? Yeah okay well hang. On okay I'm gonna say something serious okay I can wait you got a raw deal out of things but you've survived. You're a survivor and I really wish that I could make things better for you but I can't so I want you to know that no matter what happens up here it will be over one day and I will be there there. I said it yeah you did so is that like a one-way street or something is that going to be a problem for you jay? We should probably get you to bed yeah probably I'd like to begin taping our sessions, Talia no I don't want that this should be documented you can do it so what are you gonna do tomorrow? Go out. Walk into the forest. Seems like it's been forever since I've felt the fresh air or had time to myself. Sounds nice today was hard I know we could start tomorrow it's never the first night. A good control then. You don't have to go I do but nothing's happened yet everything's fine right now I'm sorry okay yeah? Hey. Good night ...and so I'm trying to understand. We'd like to help you thought you knew miss yang from some place yes so you followed her home? We got up at the same stop right. You were concerned about Ms. Yang? I... I didn't think she was who you say she is I was pretty sure that I'd seen her before. They-they harass me and they leave they leave phones everywhere for me to find they... I hear the ringing in my head. Uh okay-they like phones but they don't need they don't get problems um and they they talk around things they they don't say they don't say-say what they mean you told officer Naylor in his vehicle that they come from outer space? No no I-I-I wouldn't say that I wouldn't use those words okay things are stretching out. It's brighter. I'm over my dresser. I'm moving. Spinning slowly or twisting I'm leaving the windows now I hate this part I want to scream they don't let you scream and you are trapped inside yourself. It's brighter... wake up. Hey wake up. Huh ha ha g'morning hey how'd you sleep? Fine. I think. Good. There's some coffee in there if you want okay that sounds good. I'll just have a little. I slept later than I meant to I really want to get going yeah it's beautiful out there. I'm kind of jealous. Oh! Hey, you notice any changes? I don't think so. Nothing at all last night? No. I mean, there'd be marks. I don't think anything will happen for a few days. Well I've got a ton of work to do today. I'm gonna go through this footage and then transcribe some of our sessions okay. Well. I'm just gonna get going. Yeah. Be careful out there would you tell me again about how it started? I was eight when my parents died in a car crash and my aunt maria took me in it was hard to believe there were nightmares when it started happening but that's what maria told me I'd like to try something with you. Post hypnotic suggestion I don't know. It sounds scary. What if I'm-what if I get trapped? That's not how this works what happens is that I use specific prompts with you I guide you through it all and I ensure that when you come back you feel completely normal at ease well rested okay I trust you look I know what people are going to say okay I understand she was troubled she had issues and we were having an argument but that's not what happened I was sitting here she was here with me and then the next minute she was literally just gone Macy? Macy! Macy! You! You're not who you say you are you just you just lie and lie and you aren't who y- listen okay I don't I don't understand what you're saying okay I don't know what it means but I'm your father macy I was there when you were born look at me. Look at me. Look, we'll get you home. Okay? You can stay with gram you can have your own doctors. No more dr murphy just please Macy? Macy! This is my daughter this is macy helen graves if you've seen her seen her anywhere please please contact the number that's been given by the police macy if you're out there if you're watching this come home honey we miss you just we just want to know where you are ...and it's disgusting. And I don't even feel it all that much. How could you? During the day at least you don't think about it how's your work going? What are you wearing you? You like it? Yeah it's just seems... what? Different I guess you ready for some wine? Yes it was nice though I was able to get a lot of work done it's really quiet here oh here's the river you think there'd be at least a squirrel or something, right? It made me a little paranoid I felt like something was watching me I guess I'm just used to the... it's happening isn't it? Talia. Tal- hey hey don't get up too quick okay okay did you take my blood? Look, I'm worried about you okay? You seized up you went dark on me we have to figure out what's going on I don't want you to do that but we need to figure out what's wrong with you I'm not your possession no of course you're not throw the sample out come on you don't think that we should just get it tested? What did I just say to you? Excuse me? Tell me what I just said to you. You said I should throw it out that's right jay we can't have you behaving like them no needles no samples no experiments. You can be trusted can you? Maybe we should call it a night I'm gonna take a shower go for it sometimes I even want them to like me. The table is cold I'm naked and they're poking at me now it's disgusting I'm so embarrassed so ashamed I want to cry. They're turning me over now they've put something in my mouth it's like jello it has no flavor... hey just thought I'd say good night how are you feeling? Fine mostly Good. Mind if I stick around for a bit? It's odd. What is? Being here with you it's as if I had a really bad dream and I woke up and it wasn't real but one of the characters from my dream came with me I never trust things to be real dreams are comforting in that way. You can you can feel them start and end and good or bad whether you want them to or not that's what they do and you can trust that you know what I mean yeah I think so. I had this dream once that I woke up next to you and it was just an ordinary morning and I hold that in my hand like a photo and a wallet I dream about biting you cutting and scratching but I have to it's the only way I can keep you and there's a wilderness and it's lush but it never rains and it's you me and the bugs and we're naked and dirty and cold and hungry I never want it to end I have to go. T hen go. I will so where did we leave off last session I don't know some kind of extreme bodily harm and existential torture hey since it's our two-month anniversary-um you wouldn't have that wrong bottle of vodka lying around would you? Talia, honey, we gotta speak. Pick up the phone. Hey. Pick up the phone, Girl. Answer the phone. Pick up the phone jay? Jay? Hey, sorry. Sorry It's okay. Hey so I was thinking um I don't know if it's a good idea that you go hiking alone today so come with me well I would love to but I overslept I got all that footage from last night to watch but I'm scared that you'll have another attack like you did yesterday I don't usually get them during the day I guess... just be careful, okay?

Like if they ever bothered to explain it to you? I mean... a roach doesn't really understand the kitchen floor so how could you explain the house to it or the city or the country or the sky or the stars or the grass I only know what it feels like I don't know how to put it into words for you to understand I'm in the cocoon. It's hot in here the walls are hard like rock but the door is made of what looks like skin it has veins and it moves a bit. The ground... Hey you! You scared me good. What?

The author's up and moving how goes the novel, robert? Where is she? You know? Whether it's from the finest fields in bordeaux or for 3.99 at the bodega it's just the one damn thing that makes it worth the trip. You tell me what you did with her we took her far far from where anyone could help her and we hurt her and we tested her inside and out for our own benefit until she was so used up that she couldn't live anymore does any of that start to sound familiar to you, friend? How did I get here? How'd you get here the first time? How'd you get out of the hospital? How'd you stop being the patient and start being the doctor? I want to see her! Oh! Oh! Big man! What are you going to do? Shoot me again? If you want her: Go get her. She's outside. Go see about your girl talia! Talia! What did you want with her? With me?
