(film reel ticking) (dramatic music) - [Sydney] Extremism is a thing that most people don't understand because they don't live an extreme life, they live day-to-day going to their jobs and being with their friends and taking care of their families in their small towns with their two cars and their dog. Extremism to them is... - Ding dong, ding dong. - Hey Fred, what's up? - [Fred] Able, how are you doing? - Fine, fine, good, what's up? - Works okay? - Yeah, yeah, just the usual thing, what's up? - Well, I have some pretty exciting news, you ready? - Sure. - You sir were chosen for a field op. May I? - Oh, yeah, yeah, I thought... - A field op, yes, it turns out one of our sister agencies needs completion and bing bong you were chosen. Pretty exciting stuff, huh? And it's very, very low-risk, you're just getting your feet wet and there's nothing to worry about. - You're sure? - If I was you sir, I wouldn't ask so many questions. You're now in the fold. - I really, I never... - Don't even worry about it, okay. All you're doing is dropping of a simple package, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and you'll be home in time for dinner. Your work's outstanding Able. This is nothing really, it's just routine. - It's everything to me Fred. - That is why I like you, that is why I like you so damn much. Did you make this? - [Able] You know I did. - If I could just see the world through your eyes, I'd be better man. That is why I keep you around sir. Just check your email and we'll see you in the morning, okay bud? - Okay. - Put me the game coach. Have a good one. (dramatic music) - [Sydney] We're live with award winning host Sydney Beale. Ignorance is bliss for those who are ignorant but for the rest of us it's a pain in the ass. I want ya to tell me what you think is going on 'cause what you think is going on, what you believe is going on is not what's really going on it's what you think. - [Group] Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump. - [Sydney] Don't tell me you're right when there's a fact out there that says many times over you're wrong. And what's happened is people think things and then all these other thousands of people say, "Oh, yeah I think that too." And then they create websites, and they create newspapers online, and they write articles, and they know their audience, and they appoint these things to their audience. It's not true but that doesn't matter. What you think, what you believe, what you want to think is true, is true to you. If you wanna believe it, it's not a fabrication. But you know what is, things that aren't true are not factual. (sirens roaring) They're just not curious. (group chattering) But it's important to be curious for everybody else. I don't I have $49,000 laying around do you? And having a lack of interest in finding out what's real. Same thing as running the scissors. - [Able] Hey buddy, how are ya? - Ah, is that it in there? - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You know what's in that. I'm making you nervous. - Yeah, you're making me nervous, yeah. - I think we need to get this done. - And we will. - Oh yeah. - And we will. Hey wait! No, no, no. - Give it here. - [Able] Let go, it's not right. - [Buck] Are you listening? - [Evelyn] Yes, I can hear you. - [Buck] I'm not asking if you can hear me. Are you listening Evelyn? - [Evelyn] Yes sir, yes I am, I am sir. - [Buck] When I came to you and your people, I was told this would be open and shut. - I... - Stop. I know the private sector pays more than your old gig in Washington but it pays more because it demands attention and discretion. Do not forget that I can cut this little inflection of yours in half and send you back to fucking mail room in Langley, understood? - Yes sir, absolutely. Fuck! - (mumbles). - [Able] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - What the fuck! Jesus Christ! Got a quarter? - I'll give you five bucks for your coat. - Fuck out of here! - 10, 10, 10, you can have mine. - This ain't a auction motherfucker. - All right, all right, I'll give you 52, $52. - All right. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's your money. - [Able] Oh my God. - [Homeless Man] It's a pretty good coat. - Here you go, thanks. Oh God. - It looks good. There you go. - Oh, oh. - Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, get your shit together.

Oh evidence by bouts of semi severe paranoia, manic episodes predominantly prompt temporary blackouts.

It was just thrown together. - You know what happens now? What happens now is that I get to visit an appointed official, an elected servant of the people. You get to sit here with your shriveled little fucking penis all because you refuse to discriminate because you're a lazy incontinent, incompetent fucker. - I don't think you can talk to me this way Evelyn. - Fuck you Phil, that's what I think. - He seemed fine. - No, no, no, no, we don't make mistakes Phil. - Well you're saying... - So now you're gonna extricate yourself while you can still get a hard on, you're fucked. - Yeah. - You're fired, pack your shit. - This is wrong, this is crazy. - Yeah, it is crazy, crazy rises, stupid drowns.

(dramatic music) - Numbers that's it, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers and numbers and information, numbers and information, numbers, that's it, that's me. - You don't, you really don't know what's in here? - [Able] No, I said I don't know. - And you didn't steal it. - [Able] Look I don't have to explain myself to you okay. - I'm sorry I wasn't, I wasn't trying to put you on the spot. - [Able] Oh really. (laughing) - No, I swear. I'm just, I'm just, I'm tired. - Let's not forget who's in control here right, remember. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - Look, I didn't steal it exactly, it's just not mine. - Are you, are you in trouble? Okay. Am I in trouble? - No, I don't know, I don't think so. - Oh. - Fuck! No more questions okay, can you just for minute. - Why not give it to whoever you're suppose to give it to and then you'll be out of trouble. - I said no more questions. - If you don't know what it is and somebody else needs it why not either figure out how fucked you are or... - You have no idea how this works. - Give it back to whose ever it is. - You have no idea what this is or how I got here. So if you don't know then all you have to go on is what I know, which is very, very fucking little. Who, who I should... - I'm just trying... - You can't help, okay. So just stick to your pretty pictures and shit. I'm handling, I'm. I don't even know what I'm looking at everyday, walls of code, the goddamn matrix rolling by and I tell it where to go and then someone else takes it to the next stop and then someone else and then someone else and then on another stop, another stop. I honestly don't even know if it ever actually stops, I'm a goddamn, I'm on track (mumbles) on a road that goes around the world. Emails about employees, coordinates to a village in Ukraine, who knows anywhere, anything, anytime, any problem, any solution. - Ukraine. - Anything. Yeah, Ukraine, South Sudan, Lebanon, Pakistan on and on, and on, and on. I'm a goddamn desk jockey, I'm a itty bitty cog in the biggest wheel on the planet. I'm the lowest man on the totem pole in a company that fixes... and then one day out of clear blue this, why? Why? - I don't know. - Maybe I saw something that no one was supposed to see. A lot of high-up problems come through my eyes, something slipped by maybe, I don't know, I don't know. Maybe something worth making me go away I don't know. I didn't tell you anything and the only people that do know they're out there looking for me. So what do I tell them in the meantime, huh? Oh hey sorry I didn't hand over the, whatever this is. - Isn't that what you can... - No. What are you fucking kidding, no, what, no! No oh my God. What are doing? She doesn't, she doesn't know what she, Jesus Christ, fuck, she's not even fucking listen to what you're saying. She doesn't listening, she's not listening, nobody ever fucking listen. They don't listen, they don't listen. You're fucked. - Hey, come on. - [Able] You're fucked, you're fucked. - I'm not trying to. - You're fucked, you're fucked, you're fucked, you're fucked. - Oh my God - You're fucked, you're fucked. - Hey wait, you're okay. - You're fucked, you're fucked. You're fucked, you're fucked. - I wasn't. Oh, my God. - You're fucked, you're fucked, you're fucked, you're fucked. - You're okay. - You're fucked, you're fucked. - Stop it. - You're fucked, you're fucked, you're fucked. - Stop it. Stop it. - You're fucked. - What the fuck you do that for man? Fuck Jesus Christ. You're gonna have slide your weapon out buddy. Come on. You can do it, come on buddy. Come on. Fuck this shit. (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (groaning) God you cocksucker! Oh fuck, son of a, why the fuck did you? Fuck you all right. (gun bangs) Fuck, goddammit. - Okay. (gun bangs) (gun bangs) - You just dropped. I just, I moved you here to the couch. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay, I didn't do anything, I didn't call anybody I swear to God I just, you blacked out and moved you, and checked your head, and moved you here, that's it. I fucking swear that's it. - Did I blackout? - I didn't, I don't, I don't know. - Tell me exactly what happened. - I don't know you just dropped. You just dropped. - Did I day anything? - No, fuck. - Why didn't you take the gun? - I don't know, I didn't, fuck. Fuck this, fuck this, fuck this. It was like a seizure or something and I, I almost took you to the hospital. - I'm glad you didn't. - The bag vibrated. - What? - The thing, the case while you were, it buzzed, it vibrated, I didn't look. I just moved you to the couch. - I think it needs a password. - You don't know it. Is there a call? - [Able] It's unknown. - What was that? - Someone's trying to find me I guess. - No, not that. - I have sometimes, a couple times a year these episodes like if I... my eyes, I can't see anything, they're all blurry. I thought I had a chance but I'm just living in a fucking fuckin' fancy. Stuck... and I just can't wake up. I thought we had everything but I couldn't keep shit together. I fucked it all up. And I pushed her away. I'm just didn't actually think she would go. I thought I could be who I wanted to be. My fucking head. I'd go back if I could. The only thing worse than not living your dreams being stuck halfway. (mumbles) I thought I'd say fuck you to her and everybody else. I hope it's over soon. It's hard knowing what you want. - Yeah. - You want me to kidnap that Dave guy? (laughing) (phone buzzing) Hello. - Are you safe? - Yeah. - You, I'm glad you picked up. You have the bag with you then. - Yeah, it's here, yeah. Who is this? - Able, we need to end this as amicably as possible. We have some folks out there looking for you. Now it makes the most sense at this point for you to just come in. - It doesn't seem safe. - Please take this kindly, you've caused a lot of trouble. We need to clean this up sweetie. - I just, I just wanna leave the bag somewhere. I can tell you where it is and go away. - With no money, no things, you can't go home, you'll be picked up at the airport. - How do I know I'll be okay? - You'll be safer if you comply. - [Able] This wasn't my fault. - [Evelyn] We know that. Where are you? We can come to you. - [Able] No, I've got, I have someone with me. - Office personnel? - No. - Do they know anything? Did you tell them anything? - No. - Able. - Nothing I didn't, I didn't say anything. - And they're safe. - Yeah, we're okay. - Okay, I'll send you a message in five minutes. - [Able] Will you be there? - You'll be fine, my people are perfectly capable. - I want... - You're not in a bargaining position Able. Five minutes, are you mobile? - Yeah, I can be, yeah. - Five minutes. - I can't unlock the phone. - Can you see the texts on the front screen? - Yeah probably, yeah. - Five minutes. Motherfucker yes! Oh eat my ass Able James! Fucking Fred! Fucking everybody, fuck you! - We're not gonna have time to kill your boss. - It's cool. - God. Still got it. You still got it. - [Angela] Yeah well you can't fuckin' see. - [Able] No, it's getting better. This is some serious shit. - [Angela] You're not taking my car. - Hey whoa, whoa, hold on, take it easy buster. Twice in one day. - Fuck off Jeff! - Hey dude I was just trying, what the fuck? - [Angela] Shut the fuck up. Can you do that for me. - Yeah. - Can you shut the fuck up for me Jeff? Don't fucking speak. Don't ever fucking speak, nod. You come near my door I fuck you up, nod. Let it go dude, fuck off, and let it go. - What a dick. - [Sydney] Made it this way whether you like it or you hate it that's what you get. You don't get to choose. So take what... - My friends the long winter's night is over and springtime is here. ♪ O say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's ♪ - [Man] Now get off your phones, get of your TVs, I'm telling you, get off Facebook, take your masks off. - The state gives us our rights. - The whole park. - We are given. - Bullshit. - Our rights are given us at birth by God. - [Man] Stop blaming everyone else for your problems and take a real good look in your own heart. For once just look up, look up for guidance. - [Man] And I'm just one person, one person, you know and I made a shield, I took a stick, throw my gas mask on and my helmet and I went in there and I cracked the skulls of some commies that we're attacking us. And now today we're all here together standing up for liberty and freedom. - [Man] What do we stand for? - [Group] Freedom! - [Man] Stop looking at the government and for once get down on your knees and pray to God and ask God for help. I'm telling ya. - [Man] We are here today guys... - Do not (mumbles) government. - For free speech. ♪ O say does that star-spangled banner yet ♪ And the darkness is slowly coming in from the East Coast, the West Coast, and it's squeezing it's way on. And that republic that they gave is to stay free. - [Man] God bless you. ♪ Home of the brave ♪ And may God bless the United States of America. - [Man] You have to be willing to bleed. (group chattering) And it's okay to be a beautiful Christian too. (group cheering) - [Buck] Evelyn, you look lovely. - Thank you sir. - What can you tell me? - Well it's not ideal, we seem to have, things will improve within in the next couple of hours I just need to hear from a few of my associates before we know when you're in the clear. - Am I fucked Evelyn? - I'm not sure it's... - If you keep stuttering and fumbling through every fucking word I'm going to pull them out of your throat. Am I fucked? - I don't know yet sir. Once we can... - We did Evelyn, I was under the impression that we did, that's why I sent my personal head of security to finish this. I've had it up to here with your apologies and your niceties and talking down to me like you were my fucking mother! - It was human error sir. - Just, just tell me what happened and where we stand. I'm trying to stay in control but you're making it exceptionally, exceedingly hard. - What I'm trying to do is keep at the very least six degrees of separation between you and the nuances of this. - This is being exasperated, this could of been swept under the rug a week ago and I could have had my property back, oh hell a month ago had we just... - Followed your plans sir. - Excuse me. - This matter ran the risk of blowing completely out of control into an absolute shit storm sir. Now we're dealing with it accordingly. - Don't you dare talk down to me you fucking child. I have been in this racket 45 years, started when you were a fuckin' tadpole in your daddy's prunes and don't think you have the right or privilege of speaking to me, me as an equal. I wrote you a check, I pay your bills, I pay your peoples bills, I pay for your doggie daycare and your mannish apartment in the hills so you can mitigate human fucking error. And don't you think for one second that you are remotely in charge, do you understand me? - Neither are you sir. - Get out of my fucking' office. - Politicians are petty sir. You're angry right now, you should be but when this is all done you're worship the ground I walk on. Then you'll give me a pitch perfect referral to the next petty entitled prick who doesn't understand when you leave personal and sensitive property somewhere you aren't suppose to and the wrong people find it solutions are very complex and expensive. Or maybe he'll tow that line of recreation like you seem to. If I were you sir, I'd start asking what you need to do from here on out. Do you understand? - Good speech. - Control your dick. (dramatic music) - [Sydney] 'Cause if we did better than all these people that have these dirty energy job. - And they got one of those big buckets on a trailer, oh my God. - [Sydney] Their families depend on them, their communities depends on them and we depend on the. - He died but. - [Sydney] Doing those things so that we can continue to drive our cars and heat our homes and use the fuels. Because that's the way the system is set up. If we look at our small communities they are suffering and the people that live there have no other way to make sure that their family is feed, to make sure that they have a house to live in and what's happening is their communities are collapsing. - What do we do? - [Sydney] Ghost town because jobs are disappearing. - Oh thank God, come on out. - Want me to get out? Are you okay? - [Sydney] We're all gonna die. (mumbles) and making sure... - Hey, I. - Jesus Christ. - You'll be fine. - Is someone with you? - Yes. - Who? - I'm... - Who? - He's here, the guy you're here for, in the car. - You a friend? - No, no, I mean, I mean... no. - Okay, so he's in the car then. - Yeah. - Say again. - Yeah. - [Ed] So all right just bring him on out okay. - Yeah. Come on it's okay, come on. - [Ed] You armed? Are you armed? - He's coming. Come on it's okay. - I can't. - Are you armed? He's gotta go, come on. - Yes, you can. - It's not right. - Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, put it down. (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) - [Sydney] You think you know. - Come on, stop it. - I can't. - Stop it. Put it down. - Are you armed? - He's coming. - Put it down. It's okay. - I can't. - [Angela] Stop it. Stop it. Put it down. It's okay. - [Sydney] Earth because if the earth is too screwed up that we're not gonna be able to live on it, if we can't live on it what's the point of earth, right. - Put it down. We're not armed. - Okay. Come on over. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, we're all locked in here. Right, be there shortly. In 25, 30 minutes, well do. Can I? Angela. - Yeah. - Thank you so much for bringing him in. Sorry about this whole thing. Did he hurt you at all? - No, no of course not. - He's gun was empty I figured. Did he tell you anything? - No, no, what's gonna happen to him? - Shit, I don't know. You know we bring him in and then it's out of our hands. Hell, you know these things happen every once in a while, it just, oh, you got some peanuts here. Do you mind? - Seriously? - Yeah, I mean if you don't mind. - Yeah, I mean sure I guess that's fine. - He tell you where he works. - No, I don't know anything, all right. - Yeah, no, yeah, fine. You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Okay, he didn't hurt anybody. - Now. - He's not gonna get like, he didn't hurt anyone. (gun bangs) (groaning) - You cocksucker, ow, fuck, son of a, why the fuck did you? Fuck you all right. (gun bangs) Fuck goddammit. - Okay. (gun bangs) What's gonna happen to me? - Anyways, hey you're free to go home. I, don't tell anybody about this okay, this address or any of this stuff. We're gonna have somebody watch ya, you should know that. So don't tell anybody. Hey and thanks for this. Yes. You have a good night. - Hey, that's it, that's all. - There's a number on there, anything comes up feel free to use it. - Wait you're not, you're not gonna like question me or send me to Gitmo or try to kill me or something. - Gitmo, no. In Cuba, Cuba right? Gitmo. (laughing) That's funny. - Hey. - Yeah. - Is he gonna be okay? - Probably. - You know he's not well, he's like ill, right, he's mentally ill. - Not my problem, not my job, not my problem. (gentle music) - [Sydney] But you never get to know them because you don't have any reason to interact with them and if you don't have a reason to interact with them you don't bother going into their neighborhoods to find them you just don't go there, you never see them, and you don't interact with them. Is that your fault? Are you a racist or you know I don't know, probably not but you're not gonna seek out something that's not like you if everything's working out fine and that's a problem. Because what ends up happening is you go through a neighborhood that's not like yours and all you wanna do is go through it. You don't stop and become a part of another community. If you actually took a red pen and drew on a map all the places you go from your house to wherever you go you're gonna see the same repeated patterns over and over. I'll bet you anything almost every line you make is gonna be a repeatable line that was there before because we have our areas. And I think we gotta stop having areas. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - [Man] My friends I coming to you again because I made you a pledge and I want you know that the job isn't finished. I'd like to tell you America is second to none. My fellow citizens it's important. (phone buzzing) (upbeat music) - [Sydney] Black and blue, it's KYXK's 48 hour marathon. "Counterintelligence", written, produced, and directed by Christopher Sakr.
