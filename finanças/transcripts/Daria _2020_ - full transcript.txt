The Prokešs I’m not sure if I made the right choice. What? Psychiatry. What do you mean? Don’t you ever feel we’re all crazy? We try to cure any deviation from what the majority think is normal. But how do we actually cure it? By deadening someone’s feelings? What an interesting definition of mental disorders, for a doctor. - You can’t be serious! - I am, Mom! You know... What if we’re wrong? Who’s we? The majority that agrees? - You can’t handle arguments. - Of course I can. You get so upset. You’d better find a girlfriend and stop preoccupying yourself with this. Sure. And you’re preoccupied with yourself since Dad left. All dressed up and made up all the time. You think he’ll suddenly come back? That was unnecessary. Individuals often tend to self-medicate. Depending on what helped them in the past, they abuse alcohol, THC... Are you going for a drink tonight? We’ll do a “tour de pub”. Oh no. That’s annoying. I’ve got something planned with a lady tonight. - A kind of job interview. - For real? A new organa feminina on the horizon? Well, we’ll see. A bit decadent... Is this your favourite “first date” place? You don’t like it here? I’ll give it a chance. So it’s live at last. Are you nervous? No. Should I be? I don’t know you. If it doesn’t work out, it’s just one lost night. And if it goes well... it’ll be a pleasant surprise. So, no pretence? No need to show yourself in the best light and cover your flaws? Why pretend anything? To find a partner who wants an illusion and won’t run away when he learns the truth? An interesting attitude. What if it’s not about creating an illusion for one’s partner, but about being scared of looking boring in one’s own eyes? Applied psychology in practice? I studied psychiatry, not psychology. I see. But doesn’t a good psychiatrist need to be a good psychologist in the first place? I guess that’s true. But lately especially a good pharmacist. Do you have manic-depressive disorder? Here, have some lithium and come back in six months for a check-up. Are you referring to my pharmaceutical past? Past? I didn’t know it was the past. Oh yeah. I got fired three months ago. But you’re very attentive. Shall we eat something then? Hi. I’m Tomáš. But my friends call me Taz. Mára. What are you doing here? I’m thinking of going out somewhere. Shall we go for a beer? I wouldn’t sit there if I were you. - Okay. We will go elsewhere. - You sit! - Sit. Is it reserved? - No, but... We’ll sit here then. So, where are you from? Jižní Město. Jižňák? I’ve always wondered why would anyone move to our street. But Jižňák is pretty bad too. Hi. It’s not that bad. I moved there from South Bohemia. I spent some time... We don’t need anything. I thought you were selling something. You look like billboards. Or like heavily made-up chicks. Or like faggots looking for friends. What’s the asshole saying? Son of a bitch! I get it. It’s a dilemma. If you should leave... and lick your wounded ego for three days... Or try me again... But in that case you’d lick your wounds for much longer. It’s up to you. Well... I get your nickname now. Tasmanian devil. I’m a bit quick-tempered since... - What’s your problem, baldie? - Don’t fuck with him. You hear me? Reason? I don’t get it. I didn’t get it either. I didn’t know them. I just remembered the club’s name. Compton. It’s in Vinohrady, but it closed down. Yeah. Because of me, I guess. Holy shit. Are you kidding? Yeah. The doctors said an extra millimetre... and the game would have been over. Compton closed down a week later. And I wanted to get out of Prague. I went to an organic farm in the middle of nowhere. I spent a year by myself thinking about the future. And what about those bastards? Did the police find them? No. But I will. “Are you fed up with me? Are you alright? Haven’t heard from you.” One lost night. “Daria? Are you alive? Get in touch, I’m worried.” Hey! Holy shit! Can’t you make some noise when you walk? What’s up? You look like someone’s stepped on your face. No. But a girl spit in my face. Daria. For the last five days... It’s like she’s vanished. She’s not answering her phone. I don’t know what’s going on and it pisses me off. Satan is watching you. Long and miserable is the journey from hell. But the journey there is quick. Turn away from sin while there is time! - Hi Mára! Visiting your mom? - Hello. Yeah. Here you have the patients’ files. Pick one and he or she’s all yours. I’ll only discuss your findings. The diagnosis and treatment is up to you. I don’t know, I’ll just pick one without thinking... Do you want some help? - This one then. - Let me see. I don’t know. It’s a complicated case. How come? She’s been here for five days and we can’t handle her. Cool. I like challenges. Daria. Daria. How’s it going? Quite good. Okay. What about that chick? Daria. Well, you won’t believe this. I’m choosing a patient to work with, and there she is. She’s in the madhouse? After the first date? Yeah. But I still picked her anyway. You can do that? Well... you can’t. Good evening. Who was it? The owner. My boss. Švarc. What time did you get back? Around four. Where have you been? Playing poker. Gambling. Add drugs, then shoplifting and you’re all set. What about this Daria? What? Your patient. Have you read her report? It’s an interesting case. Oh, this... Yes, I’ve skimmed through it already. I’m not sure. I think she’s oversensitive. Perhaps mild bipolar disorder. What disorder? She hasn’t been hospitalized before. Then she comes into a bar and starts pouring herself a beer. Perhaps she just wanted to try it. But then she started pouring spirits and spilling them over. Then she tore up money from customers, a bill, and set it all on fire. Typical example of a manic episode. So we medicated her. Yes, and tied her to her bed. She might have hurt herself. And the night shift could have some rest. - I’ve ironed your coat. - I won’t need it. How so? I don’t want to scare her off with a white coat. - Hey, buddy! - Hey, Ondra! How are you? - Listen, has it started already? - What? - What I said. The Apocalypse! - Sure. Listen, the world is fucked. You can’t feed a child with stories when they don’t believe them. And do you know what happens when you tell them to fuck off? No. - They put you in here. - Right. I see. Mate, I’ve worked it out. The whole world is perhaps like a fucking bank building. Like the fucking bank where I used to work. At the top there are the bosses who milk the cow. And lawyers who cover them just below them. Then there is this big fat middle part with clerks and bankers. And at the bottom there are receptionists and cleaners who cost the least. - You see? Wait. - Ondra. The monster is greedy and sucks on the invisible hand of the market until it’s all drained. - Lunch, Ondra. - What? Yeah. Thanks. Mate, mate! And then comes the fall. You see? And you know what happens? When it all dries out? They get rid of the middle. They replace the people in the middle with computers and machines. The people at the bottom work for peanuts and no one cares. And those at the top are safe. They just get moved somewhere else, to another fat cow. And the big, sad, dead middle part keeps growing. The gap widens. It’s happened to every civilisation. It’s the end. - It can’t be stopped. - Sorry, I have to go. Mate, I’m so glad you understand me. - Sure. - Look. Could you at least give me a hug? Of course. I won’t be here for much longer, you see? - Hang in there. - You too. Why are you here? A friend of mine is here, so I visit him now and then. I see. What a coincidence. As always... lately anyway. It’s good to see you. I was worried about you. Worried? You don’t even know me. Well... I don’t. But I enjoyed your company. You men are unbelievable. You’re crazy about a woman after one date even if you don’t know her at all. And when you get to know her, you get sick of her and find another. Did I do something wrong? Or you just want to share your opinion of the opposite sex? How do you feel anyway? Like a pregnant hooker. What did she say? That she felt like a pregnant hooker. - Could she really be pregnant? - No, she’s not. She has a master’s degree in pharmacy and knows all the drugs we gave her. She knows they might harm the foetus. You need to get closer to her, make her trust you. You again? I’ve brought you something. Oh, you bring me presents now? Sure. You shouldn’t. Look. Why did you come? Well, when I ran into you yesterday... That the senior doctor is called Prokešová, and that you studied psychiatry... that’s also a coincidence, right? You don’t look crazy. You know very well there’s a fine line between insanity and normality. Everything is allowed here. You can do and say what you want. But that’s not a normal life, is it? It’s just... a momentary illusion of mental freedom. I guess so. I got it. She’s lying to us. That’s not nice of her. Who are we talking about? The patient. - Daria Černá. - Oh, I see. She claims to be insane but she’s fine. It’s nonsense. That’s all you have to say? What is it, Mom? - Nothing. I’m making goulash. - Goulash? We already had it earlier in the week. Did we? Oh yes, we did. So Dad is marrying that bitch? I’m going home tomorrow. We should celebrate it. Yes, we should. But we can’t do it here. I thought tomorrow. At my place. What a snazzy apartment. It is. Only it’s haunted. These old buildings always are. So everything between heaven and earth is the creation of a deluded mind? Not deluded. Just gullible. Maybe I am a bit rational. So, tell me... Where are those bogeymen between heaven and earth? You’ll see them for yourself. If you stay the night. Well... I’d like to know what to expect. Okay. So, this building... is owned by a deranged German. There are about 20 apartments, but only seven are inhabited. There’s an attic above and no one lives below me. But I can still hear weird noises at night. It can all be explained I’m sure. Wait. Sometimes, when I leave, I know that both wings of this door are open. And when I get back, one of them is closed. I’d swear they were both open. Perhaps I’m really crazy. - A bad dream? You were screaming. - Yeah. Hey. It’s just a draught. When you open the window and slam the front door, the bedroom door moves a bit and then it slowly shuts. You have nothing to say? Like what? So it’s a draught. - And the rest? - You mean the hollow sounds? That’s the clock. Its sound carries through the wall. So what you hear during the night is the actual echo of the ticking. That’s all. Shall we eat? How could you fool me like that? How did you do that? I can’t believe it. What about the creaking floor? And the weird feeling like I’m being watched? Why does everyone I become involved with disappear without a word? I was made redundant at work, but then I learnt that they in fact took on someone else. I may be a bit paranoid, but I didn’t make everything up. - Or you think I did? - Everything can be explained. So you had a bit of bad luck. Bad luck? I feel like I’ve died and the whole world has stopped concerning me. Like there’s a huge party out there, but I’m not invited. So go if you think I’m crazy. Bullshit! You had yourself locked up in the madhouse. You pretended to be crazy. You lied to the doctors. - That’s not true. - You’d never been hospitalized before! - I had. - You had not! It’s not in your file. Yes, 3 months ago, in Červený vrch. No. That’s not possible. Sure. You know it better than I do. You know what? I can show you my discharge report. That can’t be. I’m sure it was here. Is it Červený vrch psychiatric hospital? What are you doing? I’m calling from Kroměříž psychiatric hospital. We’re missing our patient’s discharge report. Can you confirm you had a patient called Daria Černá in the last six months? Yes, I’ll wait. Thanks. What are you doing? Yes, I’m listening. I see. Thank you. Goodbye. So what did they say? Nothing. They don’t know you. You’ve never been there. It’s rubbish. Perhaps you’re lying about everything. So stop playing your fucking games! Get out. What? Get out! Maybe the world hasn’t locked you out. You have done it yourself. We have a problem. Červený vrch. Yeah, I heard. They already called me. The nurse panicked a bit, but she’ll do better next time. - Something new? - No. The blond guy paid her a visit a few times. They had a fight. She kicked him out. I think he’s definitely out. Do you have his picture? Yes, I printed it out. Here. Come in. Good afternoon, doctor. Good afternoon. How can I help you? I want to ask you for a favour. Or a question about a patient. Are you a policeman? You see? I nearly forgot. Which patient is it? Daria Černá. We’ve already discharged her. Why? Did something happen to her? No, don’t worry, she’s fine. We’d just like to know whether she had any visitors while she was here. None at all. Not even her family. What about this man? Like I said, she had no visitors, and she was here just for a fortnight. Alright. That’s all I need to know. Thank you very much. You seem to have a great memory. I have more and more patients, so I have no choice. See you later. Goodbye! There you go. “You’re in danger!” Hi. I need to run. What about your patient? Daria Černá. She was discharged. I haven’t seen her. You know how I hate lying! Mom? Like your father. You know what his lies led to. The police came to the hospital. That girl is in some deep shit. They showed me her photo with you in it. They asked whether you visited her. - And what did you say? - Nothing. They don’t know you’re my son, not yet. But I don’t understand why you keep seeing her. - Mom. - You know as her doctor... Mom, please. Not now. I’ll explain it later. - Mára? - Yeah? Be careful. Why? The man didn’t seem to be a real policeman. You know the police do visit our patients, but... this one was weird. Hi, can I come in? What is it? - You got into some shit? - Yeah, there’s no better word for it. Thanks. Hi. What do you want? I want to apologize and buy you dinner. Do you think that’s enough? Wait. Let’s go out. I need to show you something outside. Now? Now. - What is it? - This is weird. Follow them. Yeah. What the fuck! - Are you kidding me? - Get back inside. Are you crazy? - Who are you? - Us? Film extras. You’re actors? Of course. Holy fuck! Fucking actors! Hello, I’m sorry to bother you. We have a problem. Taz. Daria. - Nice to meet you. - Not yet. Where are we going? Somewhere where you’ll be safe. Can I smoke in here? No. You really know your stuff. But isn’t this too much? Cover your eyes. Why? So that... the person I’m taking you to stays safe. Anything else? - Are you having a good time? - Me? Absolutely. And you? I don’t get it. You’re his daughter? Černá and Švarc? Taz. Did you know all along? A relict from the cowboy era of the 90s. Tough guys played mafia and Švarc or Black sounds better than Josef Černý. So he’s really your father. You haven’t been in touch? Not much. He’s more interested in women and business. He owns about 20 companies, all in someone else’s name, of course. He never cared about me. I’ve always avoided three types of business. They are... drugs, guns, and pharmacy. Apart from knowledge, you need the best connections, and even so it’s too risky, because a lot of money is at stake. And mainly in pharmacy. Regardless of the economic situation, or whether there’s peace or war, pharmacy is always needed. That’s why I told you not to meddle in it. Perhaps that’s why I did. And how is it related? Well... I don’t know. I thought you’d tell us. Sure. You want to take the focus off what’s in fact the most likely version. Your shady business. Perhaps the police want to get you through me. Tell me, Mr. Prokeš, are you also rude to your parents? Sending me money doesn’t make you my father. We should talk in private. Nothing has changed here. Do you expect me to come back? No. You’re not withdrawing money with your card. I guess you’re doing good. Are you annoyed your little girl doesn’t need you anymore? Well, at least I knew you were okay when you used your card. And how’s Mom? Do you know that as well? When did you last see her? It doesn’t matter now. You should know something. You need to disappear. At least for a while. And we’ll find out what’s going on in the meantime. This is mine. I’ll take it back. Are your phones switched off? And I wouldn’t use your card either if I were you. But where shall I put you? I know of a place. Angry? I’d use a different word. It’s enriching. Juicy. I’m just angry it’s not in my hands. I get it, but I didn’t choose this either. And that’s my point. Most people don’t want to get into such shit. Just like us. - What do you want to do? - Do I have a choice? We don’t know who’s after us and why. What’s up? - What are you talking about? - Handball. Bullshit. No one talks about handball. What now? Are we supposed to be hiding here forever? It did me a lot of good. There are people just like you around here. Those who want to forget. As well as those who want to be forgotten. That’s cool. And who are those who won’t forget us? I’ll handle that. They call me the Boss. You’re the owner? Yeah. Something like that. I’m an economist. I used to be, I mean. If I recall correctly. What about you? I’m a doctor. A pharmacist. So you’ll hit it off with the Professor. Let’s see. What’s up? Let’s go. It’s terrible... Not knowing who’s after us. I know. Hopefully, Taz will help us. You trust him so much? Why is he even helping you? I don’t know. Nothing’s just black or white. I think he’s good inside. I’m listening. I can’t. We’ll be here for a long time then. Hello, could you take us to Karlovo Square? - I’m taken. - My sister needs to go to the hospital. Too bad. Take a tram then. Asshole. Hello. To Zlíchov please. I’m taken. Get out. You’re dead if we’re not there in ten minutes. That’s a dangerous game. Not wearing a seatbelt is dangerous. So? Nice. You staring at me? Really nice. I’ll show you something. Here we are. Take a look. Here. Plants. Plants. Plants. Plants. Plants. Plants. How’s it going, boys? - Good. - Great. Plants. Here we have vegetables. And next to them... - Plants. - Exactly. Here... Potatoes. We try to be self-sufficient. Don’t eat it yet. Thanks. Everyone does their best in here. What about this? Awesome, right? You like it? - Yeah. - Me too. We’re proud of this. Our steam punkers use trash to make more trash. What would you say? What are people willing to pay for this? You wouldn’t guess that. “Steam” refers to... - The Steam Age. - Exactly. They believe the Age of Steam was our heyday. Here, they are free, happy, creative and productive. Over there... That is the laboratory of... - The Professor. - Exactly. And what happens there? Soap, booze? I don’t know. How did you come up with this idea? You know... Your world outside is... Never mind. This place is simply here. Let’s go. Come. What is it? What do you want? Hey! What is it? Mrs. Černá. Where can I find your husband? Shit. You did it again. What a skill. How do you like it here? It’s fine. Full of strange people. They’re probing us, but I don’t know what to think. Especially those in the weird outfits. Steampunk. Yes, that’s a strange community. You should talk to the Professor though. That’s what the Boss said. But why? That madman used to be an expert in biochemistry and pharmacy. What are you getting at? It’s all related to her work, right? What did you find out? It’s worse than I thought. Those people won’t break. Or they really know nothing. I need to go back to Prague to dig deeper. But you’re here for something. You’re smart. I couldn’t figure out one thing. If someone wanted to kill that girl... It wouldn’t be difficult. But why would they bother watching her? And keep her away from people. Why would they do that if I was in their shoes? What if she has something... that they really want? Exactly. When I couldn’t get anything from them, I only figured out the right question. What were the bastards looking for? What was it? It’ll blow your mind. A piece of scribbled paper. A piece of paper with scribbles or ornaments. - Something like that. - Holy shit. So we’re in this shithole because of a fucking piece of paper? That’s something, right? But she hasn’t mentioned anything like that and it pisses me off. And never gave you anything. That’s what I thought. Well then, I’ll be on my way. I just wanted to tell you to vet her a bit. The Professor might help you. Okay, thanks. Taz? Can you do me a favour? I wrote a note for my mom so she’s not worried. Would you give it to her? Taz was here last night. Hello. - Hello. Thanks. - Thanks. Isn’t she a bit strange? Tereza? Yeah, she’s blind. Oh, that explains it. But you wouldn’t tell, right? She’s here to avoid an asylum. Eat your breakfast. Then come to me, make a shopping list and I’ll get it. Some clothes to wear. Then you’ll choose where you work. Okay? - Like I said, Taz was here last night. - And? You dabble in art? What? Do you have a piece of scribbled paper which someone wants? So it’s really that after all! Do you remember how I took this from my dad’s? Yeah? - What is it? - I don’t know. I really don’t. I didn’t think it was important. Where did you get this? From a loony in Červený vrch. I thought it was rubbish. It looks like it’s not. - What do you want? - Good evening. What are you doing here? You don’t need to do that with your phone. Where’s your son? Do you know what SWOT analysis is? I remember that from economics. SWOT analysis... is an analysis of threats... opportunities... but also... strengths and weaknesses. Thank you. I use it for every important decision. And it really pays off. Like last time with you. You were in a strong position, because you had a piece of information that I didn’t have. You were strong and I was weak, because I lacked that information. But now I know that your son and Daria Černá know each other. And perhaps they’re together now. Somewhere. And speaking of threats, you’re testing my patience now. Don’t worry. He’s not in danger. And as for the opportunity, you just need to tell me everything. Come on. Why don’t you tell me where I can find them? Tell me and you’ll never see me again. That’s an impressive... analysis of my opportunities. I’d like to know the same thing. I really don’t know where my son is. There. “Mom, I’m fine, don’t worry about me. I need to leave for a while. I’ll be in touch. Marek.” You see? I wasn’t lying. I don’t know where he is. I believe you, but you didn’t want me to see this. What makes you think that? There are only two ways how such a thing can get here. By mail or... someone delivered it in person. Someone you know. - Good evening. - Good evening. - This is Daria. I’m Marek. - I know who you are. May I? You’re an expert in biochemistry and pharmacy, right? Pharmacy... A science that is supposed to prolong one’s life on this overcrowded planet. That’s like washing shit in urine manure. Why were you part of it then? I got ideals, girl. And fear of suffering and death. And a bit of conceit and longing for immortality. Then I realized that the main point of life is change. What did biochemistry and pharmacy ever give the world? What? Only disbalance. We were far better off when our lives were shorter. You can’t be serious. You bet I am, girl. If you add future social and economic collapse due to overpopulation, and we get a pit full of shit that we dug ourselves and we’ll drown in it. - But pharmacy helps people in pain. - That was before World War II. Then it did more harm than good. - You should’ve chosen another field. - I know now. But now I got fired, weird things happen to me and... someone might want to kill us. Kill you? People don’t get killed nowadays. They get locked in a madhouse. Or they have accidents. You worked in research? And you asked a lot of questions. For example why some drugs deviate in spectral analysis and still include a substance that shouldn’t be there? You must have been very good. And in a high position. It always blows in the heights, you see? Thank you for the lecture. Pharmacy sucks. But what do we do? Nothing. There’s nothing you can do. No one knows you’re here, so you’re safe. Start a new life. - Someone does. Taz. - Oh, Taz. Taz was so close to death that it held his hand. He’s a living example of a man with no instinct of self-preservation. But he’s been through so much pain that he fears nothing. He even lost his... primary purpose as a man. What? To spread his seed. I see. I didn’t know that. No man brags about that. Anyway... he can’t be broken. No silencer? That’ll make a terrible noise. The human ear is deaf to cries of help and shooting. True. Mr. Koutný. Where’s Daria Černá and Marek Prokeš? How do you know my surname? Are you a cop? Okay, formalities aside. It’ll break the ice. Tom. Or do you prefer Taz? You’re quite a daredevil. I heard what you did in the last three days. The things people say about you... That it was all caused by one bad evening in Compton. Yeah. Negative causes have negative consequences. Oh man. I’m thinking about the consequences that the three gentlemen faced... if you found them. - Are you looking for someone? - Remember me? Go inside, I’ll come later. Where does the shooter live? He’s dead. He overdosed. True, he didn’t shoot. But he was one of them. He had kids. And you’ll never have any! You can’t even get it up, you’re impotent! I don’t have time for games. Tell me where they are, and I’ll go. We’ll be here for a long time then. Beautiful. - You don’t want to sleep? - I wouldn’t fall asleep. How do you cope with this? I don’t know. I got used to it, I guess. Or I’m better at suppressing it. I wish I could as well. You want to see the Professor? - Tereza! How long have you been there? - The whole time. Don’t worry. I didn’t look. I have a lot of work. I don’t have time. - No one is allowed here. - Professor, hear them out at least. Okay. I’m listening. You told us about overpopulation and the destruction of time perception, but you can tell us a lot more. You know, chemistry is all around us. It has always fascinated me, I wanted to succeed in it. But they took my dream away from me. But our lives are in danger. We don’t know who to turn to. Or whether the police are involved or not. All because of a stupid piece of paper. What is it supposed to be? We don’t know, but it’s important to them. What do you want from me? A loony gave it to me in Červený vrch. A former physician, Pavel Šmíd. Dr. Pavel Šmíd is dead! He hung himself. When I saw him, he was alive. You were given this. Hide it or die. Your chance or an anonymous letter. Even if you don’t like it, it’s a letter that kills. Don’t be scared. Don’t be scared. I just want to give you something. My creation. As a keepsake. Hide it. Hide it well. They think I’m crazy. But they may be wrong, too. I gave away so many. But only one of them is real. Which one is it? Just one. Which one is it? Which one? - Have you got a cigarette? - Yeah. Eight years ago, the press said that two Czech scientists discovered a unique cure for cancer. But today... If you search the internet, you won’t find that piece of news. - But that happens often. - Sure. One of them was doctor Pavel Šmíd. What if he figured it out? What if it’s... I don’t know what it is! I just know that just like selective herbicides used to kill weeds, their medicine was applied to all the body tissues, but it selectively killed only cells with cancerous growth. And suddenly silence. So you can’t tell us anything about the paper? Nothing about who’s behind it? Or what we should do? Can I borrow this pen? Yeah, but I want it back. Sure thing. Of course! He needed to get this out of the madhouse, because they were watching him. So he gave these papers to lots of people, but they were worthless. But he gave you the real one with the secret information. But why you? So? That’s bad. It means this is the original. And? Fuck this! Wait. Wait. - What are you doing? - We have just one means of communication. I want to talk to them. Perhaps we can strike a deal. - Don’t. - Leave me. - Wait. - Calm down. “We can help. Contact us.” PAGE NOT FOUND Nothing. There’s nothing there. It’s bullshit. - Why are you turning on the light? - Me? Marek Prokeš and Daria Černá. At last! And this is the piece of paper, isn’t it? How did you find us? How? Only one person knew where we were. Wasn’t there an easier way? I’d like to know one thing. Where was the paper this whole time? We couldn’t find it anywhere. What does it matter now? What can you tell me about this? You must be kidding. You stalk me, make my life hell because of some lunatic’s scribbles, and you’re asking me what’s going on? Alright then. We’ll see if it’s the one we were looking for. Meanwhile, you’d better stay here. Otherwise, you’d make my life unnecessarily harder. Sweet dreams. Get dressed. We need to get out. What is it? Nothing. A branch scratched me. - Are you okay? - I’m fine. - Sure? - Yeah. Okay. - Thank you. - For what? For scribbling on the paper again. We’d have been dead by now. Yeah. It’s good that Šmíd chose you. We’ve got the upper hand now. They don’t know the original is now worthless. You know what’s in it. I have an idea. Later. Now come on. Wait. You can’t mean this seriously. You like watching American movies, right? But you’re in the Czech Republic, Mr. Prokeš. - But... - You’re a doctor. - Psychiatrist. - Psychiatrist. You’re demonstrating a perfect example of suggestion. - That’s bullshit! I know what I saw. - Calm down. I think... - it’ll all be resolved soon. - For sure. Mr. Černý can do wonders with money. But he can’t keep his passion on a tight rein. So, he got up to 20 billion... - Twenty-two. - Twenty-two. And we decided to get that money back. - Are you saying... - Let me finish. You know... If you’re good with proxies, if you know how to handle Swiss bank accounts and what they call... - Sweeping. - Sweeping. Yes. That’s transferring remainders elsewhere. Then it’s difficult to find these accounts and passwords. - Ms. Daria... - Černá. ...Černá was followed. But by us. The fraud squad. We knew she was innocent from the beginning, but... we thought she might be the key to all the accounts. - And it turned out... Can I say it now? - I think you can. That she indeed was the key. Sure. - You want to make a fool of me. - Oh, please. You’re idealizing it too much, doctor. - This Professor... - Petr Mynář. Two years ago, he escaped from the psychiatric hospital in Červený vrch. Well, and those secret formulas on that piece of paper - was the SWIFT code... - IBAN. ...IBAN of the accounts, passwords... That can’t be true. - So why are you keeping me here? - We’re not, Mr. Prokeš. You’re free to go at any time. We just wanted to know whether... you were involved in it. But it turns out you’re just a puppet in Mr. Černý’s a.k.a. Švarc’s game. - Am I really free to go then? - Suit yourself. - We almost forgot to say thank you. - Yes. For opening that e-mail. - That was from you? - Just a little trick. When you open the message, we can see your computer’s IP and its location. - That’s how we found you. - Not only that. We had no idea... what else we would find on that organic farm. Two prison-breakers, two lunatics, three dangerous recidivists. - And we’re working on the rest. - But... I’m sorry. Who are you? Your neighbour from the ground floor, of course. You asked me to water your plants, I’ve got your keys. What? Where’s Mára? Who? Careful. You must be exhausted after the fever. What... What fever? You’ve had a long sleep. You also talked and cried in your sleep. It was all just a dream then? Not a very nice one I suppose. Subtitles: Veronika Šnyrychová
