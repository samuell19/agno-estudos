Disease. Disease... It's the condition... Disease. It's an abnormal condition of an organism, which impairs normal biological and/or social functions. Correct? Oh, I'm fine, shay, and how are you? Disease by definition. That's what's been missing from my theory. The simple epidemiological truth. I've written some new pages... We need to talk, shay. Have a seat. Uh, the thesis committee read your chapters. And? Shay, you're one of the smartest students I've ever had. I really want to see you succeed, but... What? Well, clearly there's something going on in your life that's affecting your work. I've been noticing it for months now. You're... You're anxious, you're uptight, and your work's all over the place, shay. That's not you. I'm fine, Carl. Really. I just have lot on my plate right now, but I'll power through. And there's something else. A couple of your undergraduate students claim that you've been verbally abusive, riding them to the point of harassment. One of them filed a complaint with the Dean. I talked to him about that. I told him it was nonsense. Shay, getting into an altercation with the Dean of the school of public health was not a good move. It wasn't an altercation. Yeah, well, he saw it differently, all right. To be honest, he wanted your head on a platter. I managed to talk him down... Thank you. But only by telling him that you would agree to take a year off. A year off? Carl, please, don't ask me to do that. Shay, I'm not asking you. If I'm not enrolled, I can't teach. If I'm not teaching, I can't support myself. Where will I go? How will I live? Can you go home for a while? That's not an option. What about friends? Uh, boyfriend? All I have is school, Carl. You'll figure something out. Uh... Okay. Maybe a semester? You're right. Maybe a semester off will do me some good. I want you to come back here really focused and ready to finish your thesis. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And shay? You can't keep using school to hide from whatever it is that's bothering you. Eventually, we all have to face our demons. I'm still waiting for July's rent. Um... I kind of don't have it in my account right now. Shay, I like you, but times are tough. I can't carry you. Look, I've got a lot going on in my life. I just need a little more time. I wish I could help, but the semester's about to begin. If you can't pay, I've got to give it to someone who can. Nona, it's shay. Lashay? Yeah. I need to come stay with you for a while. Yes, of course. Is everything okay? Everything's fine. I prayed for this. It's been five years, lashay. Please come home. I'll see you tomorrow. ♪ My eyes look away ♪ ♪ hurting and fighting and thinking ♪ ♪ 'bout what you did to me ♪ ♪ never again ♪ ♪ turn my back ♪ ♪ yeah, I gotta leave... ♪ Hi. You found it. It was getting late. I was worried. I'm so glad you're here. This is your baby sister, sunshine. She thought I'd made you up. Sunny, meet lashay. Hi. Come inside and have a seat. I'll... I'll get you some tea and... Give you a tour. Come on, baby. I'm so glad you two are getting to know each other. Tea? I made it with orange mint from my garden. Just add a little honey to sweeten it up. My sponsor says I'm the chocolate Martha Stewart. You're kidding me. You used to think boiling a hot dog was cooking. Now you think you're Martha Stewart? You never told me... On the phone. Why did you leave school, baby? Um... I'm exhausted. Where can I sleep? Don't you want dinner? I made US... I want to go to bed. This is normally sunny's room, but, uh, it's yours for as long as you want to stay. She usually sleeps with me anyway. Mm. Well, we'll... Turn in too. It's been a long day at the clinic and in preschool. The clinic? I'm an administrator at eastside health clinic. Public health? Mm-hmm. That's the field I'm getting my master's in. Public health. Lashay, while you're home, we can catch up on everything. You know I hate it when you call me that? It's just "shay" now. I'm sorry, I forgot. But, anyway, you're home... So... just act like it, okay? Come on, honey. Why do I have to be quiet? Because your sister is asleep. Now, hurry. Alcohol-free, right. How in the world are we related? We needed pancake mix. I didn't want to wake you. I was just... Let me give you a tour. That's okay. Mums... My roses... Echinacea... Lion's tail... Coleus... How do you remember all the names? It's my hobby now. I come from a long line of drunks and gardeners. Did you know that? I knew about the drunks part. It's peaceful out here, don't you think? Hot. I'm going to head inside. You can borrow my hat. I'd rather be sitting inside... Next to the air conditioner. Got pancakes and bacon going on over here. I'm the Princess of dancing. Momo's the Princess of pancakes. Shay, what are you the Princess of? I'm high priestess of nada. Where's nada? Shay is Princess of school. And I've been exiled from my kingdom. Like Shrek? I'm taking sunny to belinda's beauty shop today. Want to see if she can fit you in? Uh-uh. If you need me to pay, i... No. I didn't mean to upset you... It's fine. I only meant you might want to see some of your old friends, and you might not want to wear those rags on your head when you do. Rags? They're head wraps. My friends are coming over for lunch after my a.A. Meeting. I'd like you to meet them. Oh, so that's why you want me to get my hair done. No, shay... Not today, thanks. Got plans. Eat your breakfast, baby. Can I help you find anything else? No. Thanks. I'm Oliver... Ollie... ol. Uh... it's nice to see someone who likes it rough. Music, I mean. Okay, record store boy. Where'd you get those lines, your dad's playboys? Uh... Look, sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Shay? Stephanie? Oh, my god. I can't believe it. What are you doing here? Look at you, shay. Look at me? Look at you! You look like you should be in a magazine. What did you do to yourself? Last time I saw you, you were... Fat? Well, I'm in love now. We go to the gym together, and he works me out. Know what I'm saying? Is that...? I'm getting married! You have to come. Of course. Why are you here? I mean, when you ran away from Tacoma and nona, you said you'd stick needles in your eyes before you'd come back. I'm taking a little hiatus from school. Hiatus, huh? Sounds fancy. Nona agreed to have me, so here I am. How is nona? Same old addict, only now she's hooked on a.A. And self-help books. That's better than the bottle. Yeah, well, in typical nona fashion, she gets sober, hooks up with some guy in the program, and gets knocked up. Nona's got a kid? Apparently she's never heard of birth control. Shots, patches, pills... I mean, it's not rocket science. Shay, I've got just the hiatus for you. His name's des. He works in the law firm with my fiance, Greg. He's a little older, very fine, and definitely got his stuff together. I'm kind of done with men for a while. Just one date. It'll just be a friendly dinner at my house. You'll thank me. The Princess married the prince... And they live happily ever after. That is shocking. You came! I was just going to my room. Um, let me introduce you. Hi. I'm Lois. It's really nice to meet you. This is lashay. It's just "shay." I hope you'll be joining US for lunch, shay. I kind of have something I have to do... It would mean the world to me. Where's the party at? Ivy! Hi! Can I get a hug too? Hey! This is my daughter, lashay. It's just "shay." Oh. Hi. Well, nona is my girl. She's been more like a mother to me, really. Better than my own mother, anyway. These last couple months in a.A. Probably been the best of my life. I'm Ivy's sponsor. Lois is mine. I thought you weren't supposed to share things like that, sponsors and sponsees. It is alcoholics "anonymous." Well, I ain't ashamed to be in a.A. I didn't say you were. Let's eat. You're going to, uh, eat with US, right, shay? Okay. Great. Thank you, almighty god, for this food, and thank you for bringing my eldest daughter home to US. Amen. Lois? Intentions? I intend to stay healthy and do something important with my life. I intend to live... Every day of my life. Amen. Lois is officially a cancer survivor. Five years cancer free. Hmm. Ivy? Oh. Okay. Um... I intend to show up on time for work, every day, and to go to my parole officer once a week, and to get my g.E.D., and to keep going to my meetings, keep working on the steps, so one day, I can be just like nona. Nona? I intend... To... right my wrongs, if it takes me the rest of my life. Would you like to state your intentions, lashay? My name is shay! Not lashay! You could say that to me in a normal voice, okay? Nona, I've tried to tell you a million times in a normal voice. Wow, you just call her by her first name like you were some stranger off the street and not even her daughter. I wonder why. I think "lashay" is a beautiful name. That's why I gave it to you. But it's not what I want to be called. Can you respect that? Well, if she wants respect, she could give some respect. Ivy, this is between me and lashay. Are you kidding me?! How many times do I have to tell you? My name is shay! S-h-a-y! Shay... Please... Would you like to state your intentions? I intend to go back to my room, put on my headphones, and pretend that this conversation never happened. Hi. Come on in. Come right in. Didn't know you'd be so dressed up. You said it was just dinner with friends. Yeah... A dinner party. Indoors. With grown-ups. Okay? This is dinner-party clothes in a college town. Well, this ain't no college town. Des just got here. He's fine, right? I can't do this. You all have it so pulled together, and I'm just... Here. Come put on some of my makeup. How did you learn how to do all these things? Makeup? Men? Weight loss? Seven years ago, you were a social retard like me. I grew up. I don't feel like I belong here, Stephanie. Shay, sometimes you've got to step out of your comfort zone. That's how we grow. I'm sorry. I have to go. No... Shay? Oh, didn't see you there. I want to show you something. Tired. I want to go to bed. It'll just take a minute. Please. Please. Some 12-steppers keep a god box they put their problems in. The best way I know how to turn my problems over to god is to turn over some dirt. I write whatever comes to me... What I want to let go of or bring into my life. I scrunch up the paper, work it in the soil. When the paper breaks down, it makes the soil richer. Come spring, my problems help the plants grow. This is what you do here at night? The god box. Just try it. Write what you want to change. Put your prayers in here. Maybe some other time. Shay! Come read with me! Get out, sunny! Go! The peace corps... You can't be serious. I am joining the peace corps. Why didn't you tell me? You're my sponsor. That's messed up, Lois. I have always wanted to. Always... But a drunk can't very well go off to the jungle for two years or some remote village where there might not be a liquor store or a bar, now, can she? But now that I know I'm healthy, I'm going. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. You know that. How long will you be gone? Two years. No... Nona, you will be okay. When do you leave? Two weeks. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. I want to make a toast. Thanks, everyone, for coming to Lois' farewell party. When I first came to a.A., I was in terrible shape. After my fourth meeting, Lois pulled me aside, and she said, "the truth will set you free... But first, it'll blow your frigging head off." I wouldn't have made it these past five years if it wasn't for you. You showed me I did not have to keep living the way I was living. You gave me hope. Lois, you saved my life. Everybody, lift your non-alcoholic drinks. To Lois... To Lois... All the blessings you can stand. Hear! Hear! Hey, mind if I join you? Sure. So, how long do you think it's going to be before nona starts drinking again? What makes you think she will? Mm, I've seen this before. She doesn't have a sponsor. She'll... Hook up with some guy, fall off the wagon, and the rest of US will be left to pick up the pieces. Shay, you have every right to be angry. I know it wasn't easy growing up with nona. She thinks she can change things, but it's too late. You can't change the past, that's true, but you can stop living there. Really? Because all I can remember about my childhood is holding her ponytail while she puked... Hiding in my room from the drunks that she used to bring home. She was so weak and desperate with men back then. Look, I'm not saying this for nona's benefit, but... Isn't it a drag being pissed off all the time? No. Not at all. Isn't this what every girl dreams for herself? An absentee father, an alcoholic mother? Shay, you have a right to be angry, but, honey, you also have the right to be happy. Can't you see? I don't know how. Especially not here. Most people, they come home and worry about turning into their 13-year-old, pubescent self. My 13-year-old self was playing parent to a pathetic drunk. And nona's changed. Maybe she could help you now. Or maybe she'll just start drinking again. You have to give your mother a chance to be different, okay? Let her help you, then maybe you can let go of some of this stuff and move on. I wish you would stay. You know, I never saw you with a boy. Do you like men? If you're gay, it's okay. There are lots of lesbians in a.A.... I'm not gay. Then did something happen to you... When I was gone all those nights? Did somebody... other than me... I mean, a man... Did a man hurt you, shay? No. Really? That's the truth? I wasn't molested. Okay. If you don't want to talk about it... I don't! Okay. I know you have issues. I have issues?! With me... Because of your upbringing. Do you want to see a therapist? I'm not having this conversation with you. It's... I don't know what happened at school. You don't seem to want to tell me, but ever since you got here, you've been sitting around feeling miserable and pissed off at everybody. Don't you want something better for yourself? This is Washington. Go to the coast, get some fresh air... Change your perspective. Maybe I should try, quote, "therapy"? Tape little notes all over the place, and then one day I'll be happy. Isn't that how it works? Girl, I am doing everything I can think of to get better. If I have to paper these walls with quotes from the floor to the ceiling, if I have to go to church and a meeting every day for the rest of my life to stay sober, that's what I'm going to do. You, of all people, should know how hard that was... is... For me, how much it took for me to stop drinking. I am a middle-aged, single mother of a preschooler. I barely make my bills every month. It is a miracle that I am not walking around talking to aliens, wearing tinfoil on my head. It is by the grace of god, these quotes, my meetings, and my garden that I am alive and sober today. You haven't had your hair done in god knows how long. You hardly ever leave this house. Do you really think you can afford to be criticizing other people? Why might that be? Why might my life be so crappy? Let's get down to it. Why?! Tell me! I'm not having this conversation with you. Stop walking away from me. I spent most of my life fighting with my mother. She fought with her mother. I don't want this to go on for another generation. This has to stop with you and me. It will, because I don't want kids. Let's end this. Tell me this... Why did you come back? If there is absolutely nothing I can do for you, why are you here, shay? Because I had nowhere else to go. ♪ You will never be ♪ ♪ what I want you to be ♪ ♪ so I... ♪ Here's the deal. You can babysit sunny while I'm at work or you can get a job. You must be drinking again. In a.A. We say "fake it till you make it." It's one of our "happy little phrases," as you like to call them. Stop acting depressed, and you'll stop feeling depressed. I don't care if sunny is my half-sister or not. I didn't go to college to be a babysitter. Then get a job. Get it together, shay. Coming from you? Yes, coming from me, and you're going to start helping out around here, too. From now on, the laundry is on you. Fine! ♪ ...never stood a chance ♪ ♪ no match can light a candle without a wick ♪ ♪ and now I feel like I've been tricked... ♪ ♪ This boy came into my life... ♪ All right. Job's all yours. Greetings... Record store girl. I heard you got a job here. Just had to see it with my own eyes. You don't have to call me that. Ah, but I like it. Tell you what. For short I'll call you r.G. You call me shay, I'll call you Oliver. Extending the Oliver branch, huh? Something like that. Are you from Tacoma? I just want to keep this about work. I heard you loud and clear. You, my sister, will be left alone. One more thing. What's your theme song? What happened to "you, my sister, will be left alone"? I'm a communications major and a gemini. I have to talk. So? I don't have a theme song. Yeah, you do. Everybody does. Like, what's the one thing you have to listen to to get your thing going? Don't let me be misunderstood by Nina Simone. Hmm. Why? Feelings. The intensity. The sentiment. And do you listen to anyone besides Nina Simone? Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan. Okay. That's... that's good. That's all cool, but do you listen to any music cut in this century? I've been making $13,000 a year teaching and writing grants part-time while I was in school full-time. I couldn't afford cable, didn't belong to a gym, didn't go to bars, didn't have time to read magazines. Where would I have heard of anything new? The radio. Shay. I called your house. Nona said you'd be here. I'm pregnant. What? I mean... are you okay? Well, yeah, I'm ecstatic. I'm going to be super fat in my wedding dress now, but... Isn't it incredible? Wake up. What? I need you. You have to watch your sister today. She's sick, and I can't stay home. It's my day off. I was planning on going to the coast today. I'm asking you for one favor. She has a fever. You owe me. I owe you? Okay, don't do it for me. Do it for sunny. Fine. Just try to keep fluids in her. I'll call and check in, okay? Want to play with me? Not today. I want to go out. Not until you're feeling better. I am better. I want to go out. Please, shay. Let me take your temperature. It's normal. So, could we go out? Maybe a just little drive in the car? Yay! What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be like nona. What do you want to be when you grow up? I'd like to be an amazing woman... Like Nina Simone. She had it all together. She wasn't painfully behind the curve in high school. She wasn't an out-and-out loser when it came to relationships. When she was my age, she had a life. You okay? I don't feel so good. You're hot. Uh... I'm going to get you to momo as fast as I can. Come on. You scared me half to death. Where were you? We went to see the beach. She said she was feeling better. How could you be so irresponsible? You're going to lecture me on responsibility? Shay, you be mad at me all you want, but don't you dare drag my baby into this. I didn't know. I've had just about enough. Respect US or leave. Hey, shay, let me in. Where's nona? She went to go get sunny's Halloween costume. A month early. You know how she likes to be prepared. Oh, no, wait, maybe you don't. Sunny's with her? Why, 'cause all of a sudden now you're really concerned about her? Does nona know you've been drinking? Is it any of your business? Why haven't you got your hair retouched or anything, huh? What you got under there? Let go of me! You lowlife piece of crap! Girl, what the hell did you do? What's going on here? Sunny, go watch a video. Now. Shay... Why are you always choosing her? Ivy, I told you to call me tomorrow when you sober up. I can't help you when you're like this. I want to stay here tonight. No! Did Justin do something? Oh, you know, just go right ahead... Just go ahead and say it. Honestly, you don't care about me. You want to hate me, that's fine. You know that's not true. Really, then why? I am always the one who is standing up for you. She doesn't give one damn about you! You cannot come between me and my daughter. I told you that. She's dangerous! She attacked me! Shay. Enough. Ivy, you can't drive home like this. You can sleep it off on the sofa. I'm sorry about all that... And while I'm at it... I'm sorry for the way I acted about sunny. Did you tell Ivy I tried to hurt sunny? No, but I told her I was mad at you, and that we don't seem to be getting any closer. What are you going to do about her? Try and help. Nona, you need to cut her loose. You put your scarf back on. It's a... nervous condition called trich. I started pulling last semester at school. It's too much stress, I guess. I'm glad you told me. You don't have to cover up anything with me. Hey, uh... I want to know more about you. Not just where you're going to school or what you're studying. Who are you, shay? Actually, it's "lashay". "La" too fancy for you, huh? "Lashay" sounds like I should be sliding around a stripper's pole. You say that like it's a bad thing. Well, I like it. That's easy for you to say. You have a perfectly fine name. Oliver. My last name's toliver. Okay. Uh... Your parents named you Oliver toliver? What's your middle name? I'm not telling you. It's too country. Come on. I'll tell you mine. I don't care about yours. Damn. Come on, I ain't asking for money. Glory. No way. Glory. That's tight. I'm going to call you that from now on. So, glory... You want to hang out or something? Are you asking me out? How old are you? Old enough to know a fine woman when I see one. I'm 25. An older woman, that's what I figured. It doesn't bother you? Well, Oliver toliver doesn't scare easily. You were right. This is beautiful. Do you bring all your ladies here? Mm. It works every time. Hmm. Look, I still feel like I don't know anything about you. You know, I mean... Do you have kids? That's a grown-up question. Oh, I'm trying to step it up for you. No kids. You? No. Not until I'm out of school, working, and married. So how does it feel to be home? I miss school. And why did you leave there for here? I needed to get away from Iowa for a while. I was losing it. Well, I wasn't going postal or anything! Good, because I want to make you dinner. Saturday? When nona called, I cleared my schedule. Tell me, girl, does this weave look beautiful on you or what? I'd do anything for your mom. You look just like her, you know? Oh, so pretty. Would you take one of the family? Cheese! Now, how about you stand in the middle, shay? That's enough, nona. Okay, okay. Well, plenty of time for more pictures. Nona, how is it that you came up with "glory" for my middle name? Don't you remember? Morning glories were my father's favorite flower. He used to say, "glories thrive "in the worst possible soil "and face the morning every day with a smile. What's not to love?" Lashay glory hunter. You never told me that. I did, too. Don't you have any good memories of me? One day you will. Wow! You have hair. Very observant. I know. I mean, it's... You... Glory, you look... Wow! Uh... Dance? Here? No way.

What happened to you? Shay, I don't... No, it... I owe her an explanation. Let's just say that Justin, my ex-punk-ass boyfriend, decided I wasn't making enough money. So I came here. With rules. No drinking or drugging, work the steps, read the big book. I'll do it. Ow. You okay? I think maybe just a hot bath... That night... She came here drunk, she wanted to do to me what Justin did to her. She's just jealous of you. Is that supposed to make me feel better? We all make mistakes, shay. I don't care what you do... And I don't care what Ivy does. Be blind if you want to, but for sunny's sake, Ivy should not be living here. I have my weaknesses, shay, but blindness isn't one of them. Whoo-hoo! Oh... Sorry my place is such a mess. What's wrong? I can take care of myself... But sunny... Nona has never had the best judgement, and, you know, letting Ivy move in is just another one in a long line of bad decisions that she's made. What do you mean? My mother was a drunk... My entire childhood. I mean, stumbling, irresponsible, word-slurring drunk, specializing in alcohol and abandonment. How so? One time when I was 13, she just disappeared. Poof. Gone, for an entire week. I just knew she was dead. I vomited every morning before I went to school, but I went because I knew that it was the only place that was safe. One night while she was gone, a couple of men came banging on the door. "Come on, nona, we want to party with you." I was scared out of my mind. I knew they were going to hurt me. I spent the night in the closet, hiding, that night and every night that week. A few days later I came home and there was nona... Folding laundry like nothing had happened. Where did she go? We never talked about it. Wow... I don't know what to say. I want to forgive her, but all I can think about is the terror I felt as a child. How do I get over that? I don't think you do. I think you just learn to live around it. You know, make better memories. Should I... Get something? Uh, what's wrong? Uh... I'm a virgin. Uh... I didn't plan to be. I mean, I wasn't saving myself for marriage or anything. It's just one of those things that didn't happen. I didn't have a chance to be a normal teenager. I was too busy being this little grown-up, and I always thought eventually it would happen, like moving on to the next grade or something, but... By college, I couldn't imagine telling someone I hadn't done it yet. Then came... 21, 22, 23, and so on, and... And now here I am. It's going to sound like I'm trying to get on you, but I don't know how a brother hasn't... You look... well... Damn, and you're smart, and... And... I don't know how you're still single, let alone... I know, I'm a loser. No, that's not what I meant. It was supposed to be a compliment. Most women talk about faking orgasms. I fake talking about them. You're the first person I've told. I'm not going push you. We don't have to do anything. And to top it all off, I'm going to lose my virginity tonight, on Halloween... Really? Mm. Good morning. Momo let me sleep in my costume. Look at all the candy I got. Good job. When are you going to tell me about this guy you're seeing? Why do you think I'm seeing someone? You and Stephanie are a little old for slumber parties. Nona, leave the girl alone. She's a grown woman, right? Thank you. Welcome. His name is Oliver. We work together. You like him. Yes. Good. I've been waiting for you. I want to show you all something. Wow! Looks like I just spit you and sunny out. Want some tea, nona? Where should we put it? I want it to be someplace I can see it in every part of the room. What do you think? It's great. It's okay. Ivy? Can I ask you a favor? Um... sure. I am speaking in church on sunday about my sobriety. Will you come hear my testimony? Hi, shay. Hi, nona. What in the world do you think you're doing? What? Okay, it was, like, a couple of beers with a customer. I swear to god, Ivy, if you're not going to take your sobriety seriously, I can't help you. You sound like my mother. Maybe that's where we went wrong. I am not your mother. I am your sponsor. I'm tired. I've been working like a dog. Serious, how long do I got to keep doing this before I get a break? As long as it takes. You think this is a game we're playing? Answer me! You see me working my behind off around here. Do you think I got time to waste on you? You're not going to be my sponsor anymore? I don't know, Ivy. You don't act like a person who wants to be sober. You know what? You slept with some dude you met in a.A. They told you not even to get a frigging dog and you got a baby, so you're not any better than me! You are not going to turn this around on me. What, so shay could stay here, but I've got to get out? If you don't follow the rules, I can't help you. Fine. You don't care nothing about me! Ivy, you've got to go. At least nona finally realizes that Ivy's trouble. Stay the night. We can get up early and go to the mountains. Nona's expecting me. I told her I'd go to church tomorrow. She's giving a testimony on her sobriety. I'm guessing there's an apology in it for me. She... never apologized? Kind of, five years ago. She'd just joined a.A. When she reached that step where they make you apologize. She came to Iowa city to see me. I hadn't seen her in three years. We'd barely spoken in that time. I open the door and there she is, pregnant with sunny. I couldn't believe it. She joins a.A. And gets knocked up by the first guy she meets, and then she says something about me and her being mother and daughter again, but she keeps resting her hand on her belly. Was she talking about me or the new baby? Do you need a public apology? Maybe it'll help give me closure, put an end to all of this. I'm a new woman. Maybe nona is too. ♪ Let it shine, let it shine let it shine ♪ ♪ this little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm going to let it shine ♪ ♪ this little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm going to let it shine ♪ ♪ this little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm going to let it shine ♪ ♪ let it shine, let it shine ♪ ♪ let it shine ♪♪ Please be seated, everyone. Let US give a warm welcome to sister hunter who will deliver today's testimony. Come right on up here, sister. God is good. All the time! Many of you know that I am a recovering alcoholic. The reason that I'm sober today is only because of god's mercy. Tell it, sister! You see, I gave myself to him... Because I've realized that I was going to die if I didn't. Hallelujah! But he had other plans... And her name is sunny. My baby girl is five years old now, and every day I strive to make her as proud of me as I am of her. My other daughter, lashay, is here to celebrate with US for the first time, too. So again, I thank god and I thank all of you. ♪ Going to lay down my burdens ♪ ♪ down by the riverside... ♪ ♪ Down by the river... ♪ "Shay!" My name is shay, not lashay! If you can't get anything else right, at least get my name right. What are you doing? You want to tell your story! Let's tell them how you left me at home alone at night to do god knows what, or about the many times you brought strangers to the house to get high. Young lady, this is neither the time or the... Where were you? What? When you disappeared... For an entire week. Where did you go? Where? I was with a man. We went to a motel. We stayed high for days. He told me he loved me. I woke up one morning and he was gone... So I came home. I was a... I was a terrible mother... And a terrible person for so long that I could barely stand to look at myself in the mirror. I hated myself for what I did to you. But you're over it now? You're all recovered, and I'm supposed to forget my whole childhood? That's not what I meant. I don't care what you meant. I don't care how you feel. I'm agreeing with you, okay? I blew it! I screwed up! Mm. And I am sorry! How many times do I have to say it? I wanted to be a better mother than my mother. This is not about you! Can't you get that? Lord Jesus, don't let me lose this up in here. You know what, lashay? That's right, I called you by your name. You ain't the only one who had a hard childhood. You ain't the only one that's been hurt. I told you straight up... I said I am sorry! That is more than most of US ever get. And everything is supposed to be okay because you apologized to me a couple of times? I'm always apologizing! There's always something I didn't say right, or something I didn't do right, but as of right now, I am through being sorry. I give up. Nona says she's done. Well, I'm done. I'm leaving. Who are you calling? My advisor, Carl. Got to be something I can do back in Iowa. Hey... Stay. Why? Nobody wants me here. I want you here. Stay with me. This drawer's for you. You'd do that for me? I'd do anything for you, shay. That's the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me. ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah... ♪ ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah... ♪ ♪ Glory, glory... ♪ Shh.

Now, I don't know what's been going on between you and your mom since you got back, but I do know she's not the same lady who used to come home drunk and pass out at dinner. So? So... I wish my mom were here so I could fight with her. Stephanie, it's different. Shay, at least your relationship with nona isn't over. I'm going to talk to you about sunny. What's wrong? I kind of promised sunny that I would bring her to your wedding. Can I? She's so excited. Sure... long as she doesn't eat. No. Oh, here comes the bride! Uh... what happened? I don't know. Just pl... wait here. I'll go and see. Yeah. Shay! Shay! What happened? Miss Ivy burnt our garden. What? In the middle of the night while we were home, while sunny was in bed asleep. She poured gasoline on my roses. Was she trying...? No. If she really wanted to hurt US she would have started with the house. When did all this happen? Three nights ago. I'm sorry. I should have listened to you, shay. It's shay's prince! This must be Oliver. Pleasure to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Are you going to be okay? I'm actually meeting my new sponsor today. Maybe it'll be like after a forest fire...

Coffee? Look at her. Mm... Get that out of here. You love coffee. Well, it's making me sick. Are you pregnant? What? My mom used to love coffee till she got pregnant, and then she hated the smell. She was making that face that you're making. You're freaking me out. Why are you looking at me like that? We've been careful. It slipped off... The condom. It slipped off. Were you trying to get me pregnant? You strut around, bragging about how you knocked up your baby mama like the rest of those ignorant... macho fools of your generation? Stop. Stop. I can't be pregnant. We're in this together, all right? Crap. Whatever you want to do, I'm with you 100%. Yeah? You going to carry this baby? Honey? No, thanks. Apparently nona's not the only one who hasn't mastered the fine art of birth control. Huh? Shots, patches, pills... It ain't rocket science. You're lying. I wish. Oh, my god, girl! Our kids are going to grow up together! I'm not having it. What do you mean? Black women don't have abortions. You know that's not true. Most of US do keep our babies. Well, I can't. I'm not going to lie. I'm a Christian. I don't approve. You just need to grow up. When you lost that hundred pounds, you lost your compassion, too. I'm sorry, shay. I... I didn't mean to judge you. You should do whatever you think's right. I'm in no position to take care of a kid. Oliver certainly isn't. Yeah. Oliver. You're right. Do what you want, because women call all the shots. Oliver... I'm sorry. I just want to go back to Iowa and forget about all of this. Including me? No. But you don't want to see me anymore. Look, I know... You've never felt like this before, but what happened between US is a big deal. Don't act like it's not. That's the problem. It's too big. It's too much. You're too young to be a father, and i'm... I can't change what year I was born. Don't punish me for that. Let me finish. I'm 25 years old and I'm just starting to grow up. And? How many people ended up with the person they loved when they were 16? What, you want statistics? I just need to talk to a grown-up about all of this. Do you think I should have it? Single motherhood is harder than almost anything else in the world. If you don't really want the child... It would be impossible. What about Oliver? We've only known each other for a few months. Plus, he's, um... He's what? He's the first guy I've ever been with. Oh, shay. You can't end up with the first guy you ever slept with. Right? Oliver's in college. He's not a crack-head or a dog. You already picked better than I ever did. I'm not saying this to hurt you, but I don't want to have a kid without a father. I wanted you and sunny to have fathers. Don't you ever think about how different your life would be if you didn't have kids? Maybe you wouldn't have started drinking. I didn't drink because of you. Maybe if I had been better... There was nothing... nothing... You could have done to make me get sober. I wish I could take back your entire childhood, do it all over again the right way. But we can't. No... But I can be here for you now... If you let me. Why don't you go out back? It's cold. You'd better come inside. All these papers say my name. Are all these prayers for me? Sometimes the people you love are the people you hurt the most. I'm so sorry, baby. Momo... You haven't called me that in years. Oh... Do you know what you want to do? I'll help you. Come on. I don't know who this baby will be, but I want to find out. It's mine... I can't ignore that. Ours. You know, most of the time, if a girl's going to have a guy's baby, it's because she loves him. I care about you so much. It's okay. I spoke to my advisor and somehow managed to convince him that I'm sane again. So I'll be going back to Iowa to finish my thesis. And then I'll come back and have the baby, and stay with my mother and sunny for a while. I don't want to put any financial burden on you. One day you're going to come home from work to a dirty house, a screaming kid who's outgrown all his clothes, and then suddenly placing a financial burden on me sounds like a damn good idea. Look, don't worry, shay. I'll do my part. I want my child to know me. I don't want to be some dude who made his little donation to the gene pool and moved on. A baby could do much worse than having you as a father. That's what I'm saying. I, uh... Made this for you. For your drive back to Iowa. No more blues, all right? Are you going to grow roses again? I was thinking more like morning glories. So... You really going to visit Ivy today? She wants to make amends. When am I ever going to stop blubbering? Aw... I hope your prayers are answered. I know mine were. Aah. Oh... ooh. I was the same way when I was pregnant with you. They'll stop hurting after a few months. See you later, crocodile. See you later, alligator. So, this is me, Oliver. I burned this for you. Picked some good tunes with some good messages. I hope you like it. Be free, glory, but keep in touch, all right? You never know...
