Diya! “Waqt Waqt” Time, time, time… This is time. Tick, tick, tick… Zoom, zoom, zoom… Thump, thump, thump… Time beats. Time, time, time… This is time. Tick, tick, tick… Zoom, zoom, zoom… Thump, thump, thump… Time beats. We have to conquer time. We have to outsmart time. We have to soar beyond time. Time, time, time… This is time. Tick, tick, tick… Zoom, zoom, zoom… Thump, thump, thump… Time beats. Time moves… But I am stuck. Who will come now and uncuff me? Time, time, time… This is time. Tick, tick, tick… Zoom, zoom, zoom… Thump, thump, thump… Time beats. Time, time, time… This is time. It’s me, Diya! Nishu… It’s me. It’s me. What are you doing here? Let me explain! How did you get here? Are you following me? No, no, no… Diya, Diya... There’s no time. We have to stop the train immediately. Stop it! What happened? Calm down! Diya, sorry… Are you here to break my engagement? Why would I do that? I’m just… Engagement? What do you mean? With whom? You are marrying that fool? You’ll go to the US? My country, my people… Government hospital… Helping the ones in need. Until yesterday, you were allergic to the idea of the US. I was. Until yesterday. But not today. Diya... Diya... Only 12 minutes left! Please let me do it. Not again Nishu. Diya… No… Diya, you have to trust me! I saw the future. Trust me! Pick up. Hey! What are you doing? Hey! Cutting granny’s hair… What? Granny? Who? You, who else? You know, I found a strand of your hair in your hair clip… Half grey… My clip? Why? Because… to know your future… I would obviously need your DNA… Oh god! Even today, you are going on about your ’door darshan’? It’s ’darshak’, Diya! How many times have I told you… ’Doordarshak’! Listen! If you are late today… Along with the engagement, I’ll break your legs. Understood? That won’t happen. I’ve been sitting ready since evening. So leave… Even your friends have started coming in… Here I come… Diya… Your dream is… Time... Not I. You always dream… You always dream… Diya… You always dream… Of the other world. Of the other world. Diya… Of the other world. The experiences of today… Diya… The experiences of today… The experiences of today… Diya… The experiences of today… The experiences of today… Diya… The experiences of today… They don’t exist anymore either. “Kal Kahin” Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Yesterday is no more. Today is all there is... Only today. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Yesterday is no more. Today is all there is... Only today. Beyond today... You don’t exist. Neither do I. Two bubbles of time... Slowly fizzling away. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Yesterday is no more. Today is all there is... Only today. Diya! I did not intentionally miss our engagement. Doordarshak suddenly started working and I… Doordarshak suddenly started working and I… Wait a minute… Wait a minute… It’s not the first time this has happened Nishu! Hello Diya! Hi! If I start counting from our childhood, I’ll get old by the time I’m done. It showed me a vision from the future. Show me. Show me. It all happened so fast, I don’t know how… Of course. I just need some time Diya, I’ll figure it out. Doctor Srivastava. The ICU patient… Diya, Diya… it can see tomorrow… If you leave... I’ll be a lifeless body. What remains when the flame dies... Only darkness. If you leave... I’ll be a lifeless body. What remains when the flame dies... Only darkness. Your dream is… Time… Not I. You always dream… Of the other world. The experiences of today… They don’t exist anymore either. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Yesterday is no more. Today is all there is… Only today. Time is alive... it breathes. Time sprints... it is like a cheetah. The stitches of time are unbreakable. Only time can stitch the holes in time. It’s alive... it lives. Time, time, time... It’s a cheetah. Time, time, time... It doesn’t break… it cannot break. Time, time, time... It stitches itself... it mends itself. Time, time, time... We have to catch time today. Time, time, time... This is time. Tick, tick, tick… Zoom, zoom, zoom… Thump, thump, thump… Time beats. Time, time, time... This is time. Diya... Diya... So you mean the train is going to get robbed? Yes! And you… Your life… They will kill me? No. Nothing like that will happen. Understood? Diya, only 7 minutes, 30 seconds left. 28 seconds, 27… 26… 25… Show me how it works. Sure! Your DNA! You know what the problem was? Every time the device opens and shuts, the code resets. So I had to use astronomical calculations to devise a formula to predict its next code. The gravity of the stars, the position of the planets and the right distance. So as per the algorithm, the next code will be… Murphy’s law! One minute. It was just working. I put the correct date. Today is 6th September? Hmm 6th September… Happy birthday. Thank you. It’s here. Bring the red flag. It was right here! Where did it go? Faster! Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. The train has stopped. ”Lalkaar” Zing, zing, zing, cuts the sword. Ring, ring, ring, quivers the blade. Zing, zing, zing, cuts the sword. Ring, ring, ring, quivers the blade. Slicing heads and slashing chests. Does the valiant ever stab someone in the back? A chaotic destruction... This is my summoning. A chaotic destruction... This is my summoning. A chaotic destruction... This is my summoning. A chaotic destruction... This is my summoning. Stop! Chief sir! Please let them go! I can give you the most valuable object in the world. What is this? Doordarshak… It can look into the future. Oh yeah? Yes, in this I saw that you were going to rob the train. That’s why I pulled the chain. Oye! You pulled the chain? He’s my god… You saved me… Really! Then show me my future… Your future does not look good. Who are you? She is nobody! Let me show you. So, my future does not look good? One minute, please. How is my present? The air conditioner is on, but you are drenched in sweat. Your left arm must have shooting pain? Shifting upwards? Are your fingers numb? And chest heavy… As if a boulder is kept on it? You may have a cardiac arrest. Arrest! Did you hear that? Arrest! She’s going to get us arrested… Stop laughing you fools! She’s not just a doctor, she’s a magician. If she says that you’re going to die, then you will die. Is that so? But after you. Chief! Chief! What happened to you? Diya, come on! Chief! What happened to you? Straighten him up. Give me the defibrillator. What? There has to be one on the train. Go! I’ll find it. What? Analysing heart rhythm. Do not touch the patient. Don’t touch him. All of you move back, please. Move! Deliver shock now. Press the orange button now. Deliver shock now. Press the orange button now. “Kudiye” Girl O girl, girl O girl! Drown in my eyes and melt in my embrace. With henna on your palms and bangles on your wrists. Dance to its tunes, as the anklet bells ring. Let the bride hide in her veil. As the groom takes a peek through his headgear of flowers. May the eye of evil never touch you girl! Turn your face to the brighter side girl! Utter the truth champion! May the eye of evil never touch you girl! Utter the truth champion! Turn your face to the brighter side girl! Utter the truth champion! Grace yourself with a dot of kohl girl! May the eye of evil never touch you girl! Turn your face to the brighter side girl! Girl O girl, girl O girl! Girl O girl, girl O girl! Brush off the groom with the broom. Make him spick & span, brush off his crease. Put him on a hanger, latch him up with ease. He seats her in the decorated palanquin. Mounts the horse with his heel to take her away. He mounts the horse with his heel. Before he tumbles, whip him back in line. Utter the truth champion! Before he tumbles, whip him back in line. Utter the truth champion! Before he tumbles, whip him back in line. Utter the truth champion! Don’t leave your father’s house, don’t leave O girl! Don’t leave your father’s house, don’t leave O girl! Don’t leave your father’s house, don’t leave O girl! What are you doing here alone? Uff! You and your ’dukhdarshak’. You know what? What? I figured it out. This is a traveller of the night. Sunlight is not acceptable to it. It only works in moonlight. Should we see our future? Yesterday is no more. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Today is all there is… Only today. “Kal Kahin Reprise” No dream... I desire now. From today... No whispers of tomorrow. No dream... I desire now. From today... No whispers of tomorrow. Come let’s glimpse into the diary… Of time. Filled with poems of time, it’ll be. Let’s embark on a quest... Days of leisure... We may find somewhere. Evenings of idleness. Nights of nothingness. And nothing else. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. Yesterday is no more. Today is all there is... Only today.
