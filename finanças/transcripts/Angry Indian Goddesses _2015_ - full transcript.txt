Nargis, do you clothe dress? - No. We do not know what will be. - What? - I choose me! - Frieda has planned everything. - How romantic! - And we, what will we? I want a sari. How strong! Would you wear a sari? What? I will not put my lehenga. Laxmi, have you seen your neighbor? To which? What Ramu, who looks after the bull? - No. ¿When cleaning the car? Laxmi! Yes! Ya know it!

You are wrong! Jo, do you like? This very good. "It is very good". So funny. What a funny accent you! What will you do in Bollywood if you talk bad? "I'm embaurasada you!". I do not think talk like that. You also laughed at you. You always do the role of foreign. There are many benders. "Awa. I want awa. " - "¿Awa?" - Agua. Should I say "ajua" not? "I gussta", this is how you speak. I do not understand the problem with my accent. None, but we laugh. - Funny ... no different. - You two do me grace. We do not laugh at you.

And I asked: "You lost the keys inside, looking out why?". I replied: "I have no light at home. But on the street if so I'm looking here. " Do you get it? Funny, huh? Do you want another? Hello Laura. Annoying? We'll deal with that later. First... Lo Su-Lite Mining ... Tell them to stop. You heard right. To stop now, we leave the project. I know that there will be losses.

Nargis has fought hard by that company and those lands. Did you ever stop? He had no wedding gift. Suranjana ... It's enough? Girls, we are holidays, and uses mourn! Mother! - I did not know you were so generous. - Sometimes it happens unintentionally. Is sleeping? Where is Jo? Laxmi, ¿has visto a Jo? He'll be here. He likes long walks. - Let's call her. - 1, 2, 3. - Maya sleeps! - Is there coverage? - He's still angry? - For real? - Let's go. - Time to go back. I do not see anything. Excuse me, he has seen the girl who came with us? - No. - I Think again. It is foreign. - I did not see her. - He is not at home. The lanterns. We'll go in groups. Laxmi, llévala a casa a dormir. ¡No separéis bones! - What is that? - One chabola. - You have to call someone. - Quiet. - Excuse me! - Have you seen a girl go? There were red flags. No one. It is foreign. If it passed one. He went over there. - Have you found anything? - Nothing. What do we do? Could she have gotten into the sea? Nothing happens, quiet. We find it. Let's keep looking.

I can not do anything without the police. - Go now! - Put it on the table. - I can not move without permission. - Why? You have to treat it! She's dead, I can not revive! As it is called? Joanna. It does not look Indian. It is foreign environment. English. - What do you think? - I informed the tank. To do an autopsy. It has been sexual abuse. Ignite the lights! Had men? No. And who smoked this? I smoke. So they are wearing these clothes, eh? What happened, what they were doing? Our friend is getting married. We were celebrating. What is that? Not now! Follow. We were on a picnic. - He went for a walk. - Who? - Jo. - Jo is ...? Joanna. As we were leaving, but she was not. - I was thinking. - Alone? There were many people. It was eight. He was with us. Will you please not smoke, we are examining the scene. The victim ... What was the full name? - Joanna Mendes. - Profession? - Actress. - Actress? -Where? In Bollywood? - Tries. He tried. Who is getting married? I will marry Nargis. - Sorry? - And do you care? What's that got to do? I know what happened. Well, I find out! Why do we ask? That tone will not help you. - I also know scream. - Frieda and marry Nargis. You two get married? Lord, photos. Did the victim wearing these clothes? - What about clothes? - Sin Amor? Do not make me get upset! They are a good family. Is the daughter of Mr. D'silva? I can not say anything officially, but it seems that... were three or more men. Be strong. Withstand interrogation. The arrestaremos. Lord, I feel wake, but the victim is British. It is Bollywood actress like Katrina. The media speak. They were partying on the beach. The same situation. By drinking on the beach, dressed obscenely ... They come from different cities for a wedding. two girls marry. Lord ... yes. Yes. Who knows. And Jo? Please Laxmi. Maya, honey. Where did the photos? I followed Jo, it was very dark. OMG. Mad, look at the boy hat. They are the same! We were harassed. You remember? With whom we discussed. The red hat was on a motorcycle. We was insulting. They're the same guys! - Surunjana? They are those who stood by the jeep! You have to call someone. TO... Who, that shit cop? Who do we give? Frieda's bike is not. No no no! ¡Mad! For the bike! I I've had a fucking with that half-caste! Like screaming! - When I touch ... - Turn that off. Who you are? Surunjana for! For now! Stop Please! ¿Mad? ¡Food, para! For. We awoke to a new event. An Anglo-Indian girl was found dead on the beach. The body was a girl of 24 years. The police do not want to comment. It is said that it was a young Londoner who acted in Bollywood. The victim was having a picnic. In India they have reported 25,000 cases of rape. 24 years suffered a gang rape. The Committee on Women explodes. Cases of rape have doubled. India every 20 minutes a woman is raped. Why did the police take so long to file a complaint? The rape is an epidemic in our country. God, I commit her body to judge it. Forgive all their sins. Welcome it into your kingdom and guide her to rest in peace. Dale eternal happiness and reward his innocence for the rest of their eternal existence. Always wanted the dress. You're right. You look like an angel. These so beautiful. Joanna Mendes era... is... a butterfly. Free and fragile. It made me feel light. And he gave me strength to face the sun. Joanna Mendes will live in my heart forever and no evil can hurt. ¿Iras al funeral ? No, Zain. - I dare not go to church. - Voucher. - Can I call you back? - If, at anytime. I just wanted to congratulate you. - What? - You do not know? You video is a success! I'm not in the mood for jokes. It's not any joke. Watch the mail! I sent him for hours. BEAUTIFUL SONG OF MAD ABOUT LIFE. I LOVE! I am outraged that we can not write our own stories. I'm sick of protest. I never want to get angry. Perhaps it is better that Joanna's soul rest in peace. Maybe, in his next life, or all the women here, we can write our stories. I feel ... so sorry having to go well, in this situation. I understand the loss of your loved one. Whoever did this ... I know it's unforgivable crime. But, last night, They killed five people. we have evidence that the murderers of the five men They are in this church. If they were guilty of the crime against Joanna They should have been tried by the courts. I hope you understand and collaborate. Anyone who has taken the law into their own hands, I get up now. That is up! That is up!
