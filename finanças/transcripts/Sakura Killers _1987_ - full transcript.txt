YEAH, THEY -- THEY COULD BE PRETTY DEADLY. -WHAT'S THE RESEARCH, COLONEL? -YOU SEE, THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT YOU PLAY IT ALONE.

I'M NOT TOO SURE. I MUST TALK TO HIM FIRST. -WHEN CAN YOU LET US KNOW. -I WILL GIVE YOU AN ADDRESS. YOU CAN GO THERE TONIGHT. -WHAT TIME? -AROUND 8:00. -SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER. -OKAY, WE'LL BE THERE. -UH, I GOT TO GO. I'LL DO WHAT I CAN, OKAY? THIS EVENING.

COME WITH ME. -OKAY. -UNCLE? THIS IS MY UNCLE, MASTER SUGIYAMA. -GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN. I AM PLEASED YOU COULD COME. -WE APPRECIATE YOU SEEING US ON SUCH A SHORT NOTICE. -TELL ME, HOW CAN I HELP YOU? -SOME INFORMATION... ABOUT THIS. -YES. THIS IS THE SYMBOL OF THE COLD SNOW ASSOCIATION. -COLD SNOW. WHAT'S THAT? -A DIVISION OF THE SAKURAI ORGANIZATION. THEY MASQUERADE THEMSELVES AS BUSINESSMEN, BUT AT HEART, THEY WILL ALWAYS BE COLD-BLOODED KILLERS WHO USE THEIR TALENTS FOR PERSONAL GAIN. -MASTER SUGIYAMA, WHERE DID YOU GET THE SYMBOL FROM? -FROM A NINJA WHO WAS SENT TO KILL ME. -WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO KILL YOU? -I WAS A NINJA MASTER. AND I FOUND OUT WHAT THESE PEOPLE WERE REALLY PLANNING. AND SO I FOUGHT AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION. UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS ONE AGAINST MANY. I HAD TO RUN INTO THE MOUNTAINS. -DO THEY STILL WANT TO KILL YOU? -THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY. AND SO I TOOK MANJI WITH ME. AND HERE WE ARE HIDING. -HAVE YOU EVER MET THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THIS ORGANIZATION? -I HAVE SEEN HIM. -I THINK THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. -YEAH. -THEN YOU MUST BE ON YOUR GUARD. THEY ARE A RUTHLESS GROUP. -IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT TAPE BACK. -IT WON'T BE EASY. YOU MUST FIRST LEARN THE WAYS OF THE NINJA. YOU CAN'T DEFEAT THEM OTHERWISE. -NINJA, HUH? -THAT IS RIGHT. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] -MASTER SUGIYAMA, YOUR SKILLS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. WE WERE MORE THAN IMPRESSED. -THE TWO OF YOU HAVE VERY GOOD FOUNDATIONS. YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH GREAT COURAGE AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IT SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE NINJA. -I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN, MASTER SUGIYAMA, FOR HELPING US. -MY NIECE HAS RECOMMENDED THE TWO OF YOU. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO OBTAIN YOUR GOALS, YOU MUST FIRST FIND A TEACHER. I FEEL IT MY MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH YOU. THE TWO OF YOU WILL RECEIVE STRICT AND FORMAL DISCIPLINE IN THE ART OF NINJUTSU. -THANK YOU. -THANK YOU. -WE HAVE LIMITED TIME IN WHICH TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH TECHNIQUES NINJAS HAVE STUDIED SINCE CHILDHOOD. TRAINING WILL BE BITTER AND HARD. SPEED IN RUNNING IS ESSENTIAL. TO ACHIEVE THIS SPEED, START BY HOLDING A STRAW HAT TO YOUR CHEST AND RUN. CONTINUE RUNNING UNTIL EVENTUALLY YOU NEED NO LONGER USE YOUR HANDS TO HOLD THE HAT. TECHNIQUE AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND GREATLY ON ENVIRONMENT. SAND IS ALREADY MORE DIFFICULT THAN GROUND. IF YOU DROP THE STRAW HAT, DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED. PICK IT UP IMMEDIATELY AND KEEP RUNNING. CONCENTRATE ON SPEED. A NINJA MUST DEVELOP STRENGTH AND RESISTANCE IN HIS HANDS AND FINGERS. BEGIN BY CHOPPING AT A BALE OF DRIED STRAW. THIS WILL HARDEN YOUR HANDS. IN ADDITION TO CHOPPING, YOU MUST STAB AT THE BALE WITH YOUR FINGERS. THIS WILL DEVELOP TOUGHNESS AND STRENGTHEN THEM. THIS STRENGTH WILL ALSO BE BENEFICIAL WHEN HOLDING YOUR SAMURAI SWORD. THE SPECIAL PUNCHING AND KICKING SKILLS OF THE NINJA REQUIRE STRENGTH AND BALANCE. YOU MUST PRACTICE RELENTLESSLY. IN TIME, YOU WILL MOVE WITHOUT THINKING. -YOU LOST HER. HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN? -THE AMERICANS ARE MORE CLEVER THAN WE EXPECTED. -THERE IS NO ROOM FOR EXCUSES. NOW, YOU GET THE BASTARDS, OR ELSE... DO YOU UNDERSTAND? -YES. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] -YOU HAVE PROGRESSED VERY QUICKLY, MY FRIENDS. BUT YOUR TRAINING IS NOT YET COMPLETE. -WHAT REMAINS TO BE LEARNED, MASTER? -NOW I WILL TEACH YOU NINJUTSU SECRET WEAPONS. WEAPONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF NINJA TRAINING. AND OUR SO-CALLED SECRET WEAPONS INCLUDE SHURIKENS, OR THROWING STARS. THEY COME IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES AND WEIGHT. THROWING THEM IS NOT A SIMPLE MATTER. PUT YOUR BODY INTO IT. THROW THEM WITH POWER. THE FINAL TEST FOR SPEED RUNNING WILL BE HERE ON CHASING MOUNTAIN. THE TERRAIN IS ROUGH AND UNEVEN. A NINJA MUST HAVE THE WILL AND DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED. HE MUST KNOW ENDURANCE AND PERSEVERANCE. THERE IS NO FAILURE FOR A NINJA. BASIC TRAINING WITH THE SWORD INCLUDES CHOPPING AT WOODEN OR BAMBOO POLES. CONCENTRATE ON THE BLADE AND THE POINT OF CONTACT. EVENTUALLY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SPLIT THE POLE RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. YOU HAVE DONE WELL. NOW LISTEN TO ME. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN TROUBLE, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR ESCAPE BY TUNNELING OR BY SETTING OR THROWING THESE SMOKE BOMBS. WHEN FIGHTING AS A NINJA, REMEMBER TO ALWAYS WEAR YOUR MASKS IN ORDER TO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY. -YES, MASTER. -YES, MASTER. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] -I WONDER IF THE COLONEL'S BEEN TRYING TO FIND US. HE'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW WE'RE READY FOR ACTION. [ ELEVATOR DINGS ] BOY, I CAN'T WAIT TO SLEEP IN MY OWN BED. -The trap is set right in the park. -I UNDERSTAND. [ MUSIC PLAYING FROM HEADPHONES ] -[ HUMMING ] -DENNIS. HEY. HEY. YOU WANT ONE? -OH, SURE. THANKS. [ HUMMING ] [ SLURPS ] [ DOORBELL RINGS ] -COME IN. [ DOORBELL RINGING ] -COME IN!

NO. NO, I... YES, I'M CALLING FROM THE UNITED STATES. YES, I'M FINE, THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. LISTEN, COULD YOU PLEASE RING ROOM 623 FOR ME? THANK YOU. REALLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE INEFFICIENCY SOMETIMES. HELLO? YES, THANK YOU. IT'S RINGING. -WELL, NOT ALL CULTURES ARE QUITE AS OBSESSED WITH SPEED AS THIS ONE. FORM IS, UH, SOMETIMES MORE IMPORTANT. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] -[ GROANS ] [ RINGING CONTINUES ] -GET THAT BASTARD. -THERE'S NO ANSWER ANYWAY. -MAYBE THEY'RE RELAXING ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE OR STROLLING THROUGH ONE OF THOSE LOVELY LITTLE PARKS. -THIS IS MUCH TOO QUIET FOR ME. -YEAH, AND EMPTY. -I FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY ALONE HERE. -I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. -I HEAR SOMETHING. [ CHIRPING SOUND ] -WELL, YOU GUYS ARE DEAD. -WHOA! [ GRUNTING ] -[ GRUNTING ] GHOST...FACE...NINJA. -GHOST FACE? SUGIYAMA. -GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY. -WELL, IT SURE FELT GOOD TO GET A PIECE OF THOSE GUYS FOR ONCE. SO, WHAT'S YOUR NEXT PLAN, NINJA COWBOY? -MY PLAN? -WHEN DID YOU GET BACK FROM THE MOUNTAIN? -HUH. SOME FRIEND YOU ARE. WHY DID YOU LEAVE US? -I DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB YOUR PRACTICING. -RIGHT. -IT'S A GOOD THING YOU DID LEAVE. OR HANDSOME HERE COULDN'T CONCENTRATE. -ARE YOU STILL STAYING AT THE HOTEL? -YEAH. -GO AHEAD AND TELL HER. -ME AND DENNIS WERE ATTACKED BY THE SAKURAI PEOPLE. -HAVE YOU GOT ANY NEW LEADS? CAN YOU THINK OF ANY PLACE TO START? -YEAH. MAYBE WE OUGHT TO PAY THEM ANOTHER VISIT. -WHAT?! LAST TIME WE WERE THERE, WE GOT ATTACKED! -I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. MAYBE YOU WILL FIND OUT SOMETHING. I'LL GO WITH YOU. -HERE WE GO AGAIN. -NO, YOU STAY. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE STAYS?! -I MEAN SHE STAYS. -MAN, THERE YOU GO AGAIN. MAN, SHE KNOWS THIS PLACE. BESIDES, SHE KNOWS THE SAKURAI PEOPLE. SHE KNOWS THE WAY THEY THINK. WE NEED HER. -OKAY. -OKAY, GOOD. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. YOU PAY FOR THE CHECK. THERE IT IS. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE WERE. -YEAH, BUT LOOK. THE SIGN IS GONE. -YOU WAIT HERE. I'LL GO INSIDE AND CHECK, OKAY? -WILL YOU STOP MARCHING UP AND DOWN? YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS. -WELL, SHE'S TAKING TOO LONG. -SHE'S ONLY BEEN IN THERE A COUPLE MINUTES. HERE SHE IS NOW. COME ON. -SHE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. -NOW WHAT? -BUT I GOT HER ADDRESS. -OKAY, GREAT. WE'RE BACK ON THE BALL. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. -THIS IS THE PLACE. -ARE YOU SURE? -YES. -SO, LET'S GO IN. -NO. YOU GUYS WAIT HERE. -WOULDN'T IT BE A BETTER IDEA IF WE ALL GO IN? -NO, JUST WAIT HERE, BOTH OF YOU. -JUST DON'T TAKE TOO LONG, OKAY? -DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. [ BUZZER BLARES ] HI, CAN I COME IN? -SURE. -MS. YUKIKO? -YES? -I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. -YES. THIS WAY. HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE. -NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE. YOU LIVE HERE LONG? -HOW DID YOU GET MY ADDRESS? -WELL, I JUST, UH -- I WENT BY THE JAPANESE RESTAURANT WHERE YOU WORK, AND, UH, AND, UH, ASKED A COUPLE PEOPLE. THEY TOLD ME WHERE YOU LIVED, SO I CAME BY. -I DON'T LIKE THIS. WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG? -DO YOU THINK ANYTHING'S WRONG? -I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T LIKE THIS. WHERE IS HE? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. -HEY, THERE'S YUKIKO! -WHERE'S SONNY AT?! -LET'S GO IN AND FIND OUT. -YEAH. WELL, WHERE IS HE? SONNY! SONNY, SONNY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SONNY? SONNY, WAKE UP, SONNY. COME ON. WAKE UP. COME ON. -SONNY. WAKE UP. SONNY. -COME ON. WAKE UP. SONNY. SONNY.

SHE'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS. -LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. COME ON. LET'S GO. -[ GROANS ] -I'LL HELP YOU. GET HIS JACKET. [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] -SONNY'S BEEN HURT, AND THEY'VE LOST THE GIRL. -IS HE ALL RIGHT? WHICH GIRL? -YUKIKO. SOMEONE HIT HIM OVER THE HEAD WHILE HE WAS QUESTIONING HER AT HER HOUSE. HE'S BRUISED, BUT OKAY. -WELL, HE'S LUCKY THEY DIDN'T KILL HIM. DID SHE TELL HIM ANYTHING? -NO. AND NOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS. -OH. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY MIXED UP IN THIS SOMEHOW. IS SHE THE SAME GIRL THAT WORKS AT THAT RESTAURANT BY THE WATER? -SHE MUST BE. -DO SONNY AND DENNIS KNOW THAT? -WE JUST FOUND OUT OURSELVES. -BUT DO WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? -THEY'RE WAITING FOR OUR INSTRUCTIONS. -HMM. WELL, THE SAKURAI SHOULD HAVE KILLED SONNY WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE. EITHER IT WAS A MISTAKE, OR I'M SENDING THEM BOTH INTO A TRAP. -OVER THERE. -NO, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OVER THERE. -ARE YOU SURE IT'S HERE? -HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND IT? -WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL DAY. [ DRUMMING ] -I KNOW IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. -TELL THEM THEY SHOULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT BY THE RIVER. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME, BUT FIND THAT OUT. ONCE THEY GET THERE, THEY SHOULD ACT LIKE REAL TOURISTS. WE KNOW THAT WHOEVER WE'RE DEALING WITH HAS SPIES EVERYWHERE, SO PLAY IT OUT. -WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED. YOU KNOW, THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR. I THINK I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE SOMEWHERE. -WELL, MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. -[ LAUGHS ] NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT, MAN. -WELL, WHAT IS IT? -IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. -WHAT? -WHAT'S THAT? -WHERE'D YOU GET THIS FROM? -YUKIKO'S PLACE. -YUKIKO AGAIN. -COULD BE A LEAD. -LET ME ASK.
