You have called for me, Zeus. Lang, we have some troubling business to attend to. You are the most powerful warrior under my leadership. But I altered another man before you. ; Kan Fung. He underwent the same genetic modifications as you... ...but unfortunately, he has escaped. Where? I've been tracking him through several countries. He's searching for a geneticist to control the mutating seed I implanted in him. This is a list of the scientists you must terminate... ...before he can contact them. Interesting. You and Kan Fung are the greatest mercenaries ever created. But Kan Fung has decided to use his powers for the good of others. He has become a mask ed vigilante. Bring him back to me. Alive. Same results again? My God... God had nothing to do with this. Doctor Ichien. Who are you? Ten days ago you received a blood sample. I?s yours? Why? I don't trust anyone who wears a mask. Especially after this... Four geneticists killed in different countries. Why did you do it? These scientists were killed before I even got to them. My enemies have a list of genetic engineers like you. So they are after me now? Don't kill me! - Where's your car? - Behind the building. I'll take care of them. Get out of here. Here! Quick! Here! Quick! Let him go. He doesn't know anything. Damn you! Don't blame me, Kan. You killed him. If you hadn't been here, I wouldn't have shot him. Which would have kept our overhead down. One less bullet. You're one of us, Kan! You can run, but you'll always be one of us! You're mine! Ungrateful shit. B City 12: 12 p.m. Irradiated host cells have entered stage 5 mutation. 12: 17 p.m. Introducing mutagen suppressor 154 into cell environment. 12:21 p.m. Structure of host cells compromised. Suppressor G-154 is a failure. What? Parcel for Dr. Leung. I think this is for you. There's no return address, but... Listen... I know you've been working very hard lately, and... Why don't we go out and relax? Le?s have lunch together? What do you say? Come on. Make an exception. Just once? Are you happy now? I thought it wouldn't happen every time... Yeah, yeah. Well, now you know. Why is this blood evaporating? I?s boiling! Tha?s impossible. Must be some chemical reaction with the air. Phosphorus does that. Not blood. Maybe i?s not blood, then. Hey, listen, look. I'm really sorry about all this. Think you can give me another chance? Just a tiny little one? - On one condition. - Anything. Disappear. Think you can do that? Forever? Just for 24 hours. So I can get some work done. Fair enough. Marco Leung. Are you alone? - Excuse me? - Are you alone? Ha, ha, ha. Very funny. Bye. B City is red hot, as wrestling fans have gathered at the Dome... Fans have been fighting to get tick ets for what is sure to be... ...the most sensational wrestling show of the year. Good evening, wrestling fans! Tonight, the Super World Championship Wrestling Federation presents. ; Smashmouth 2002! The greatest event of this and any millennium! Tha?s right, wrestling fans, you are about to witness... ...the future of pro wrestling. A new kind of warrior for a new age. Faster, stronger and badder than anything... ...you've ever seen kick ass in this ring before. How's my little lguana, baby? I'm so hot I'm on fire. Make it last long. All the hardcore fans are here to see you beat Hellraiser. I'm gonna give them all I got. Sexy. Get a room. Okay, people. Are you ready to tumble? What kind of half-ass bullshit is that? I've got 25,000 people out there! That is.0025 percent... ...of the biggest market in the goddamn world! Baby, tha?s better. Tha?s what I want. I want you to make them go nuts. I want the girls to whisper your names when they get laid. I want the guys to stick your names on bumper stickers all over the world. I want you to show them what wrestling is all about! I want you to show them who you are! Now, who are you? Wolf. Wolf. - Snake - Snak e. Claw. Chameleon. Iguana. Iguana. Dad! Hey, there's my little hero. Wha?s up? How's it going? I'm okay. You okay? I'm in great shape. I?s gonna be a great show. - Tonight with the baddest of the bad, Hellraiser... ...king of the dead! Dad, are they ever gonna let you be a good guy again? Good guy? Why would I want to be a good guy? Good guys are boring. Come on, do you think all those people up there came to see the good guy? They came to see the bad guy. They came to see me. Last ride powerbomb! So le?s give it up for the new golden boy of wrestling... ...the master of pain himself, the lguana! Iguana! Lguana! Lguana! Lguana! Lguana! They're calling my name! Hey, Ross. I've had a change in plans. - I'm gonna let you win, put you over. - Are you kidding? Is this a new script from King or something? Honestly, I have no... Really, Ross. I'm gonna put you over. We'll do it just like in Tokyo. You give me some heat first. And then, instead of my... They're calling my name. They're calling my name. They're calling my name. Oh, my God! Did you see that? - Reporting from the stadium. One wrestler has gone mad and is rampaging through the aisles. Police are on their way. Our crew outside... The creature is reaching the outskirts of the stadium. - I could never stand you guys. - Mr. Martinez, could you...? Flash! Flash! Flash! You want a nice close-up? Father for lunch... ...son for dinner. Leave my father alone! - Freeze! - Guns down! Guns down, there's a kid up there. Most of the crowd has fled... - lguana has seriously injured one wrestler and bystanders. - Doing the impossible, he is scaling the outside wall with his hands alone. Dan, no! Let him go! He's our friend, Dan! Want a hostage? Take me! Let the kid go. There are two now at the top of the building. There are two people going to the side. One is lguana, the famous wrestler. He is fighting with another man. Who is he fighting with? Another amazing twist, as an unknown costumed man enters the scene. - Enters to fight the monster. But who is the man behind the black mask? - Grab her! - Go! Go! Climb! Climb up! We don't have to do this. Maybe I can help you. I am not a monster. No. What was that? Part of the show? Who's next? Me? You told us we would be able to control the change. - You lied! - No, I... Excuse me, boys. I swear I didn't... Oh, God! God! I swear I didn't lie. I just told you... What I told him to tell you. Mr. King is on a need-to-know basis. And he almost never needs to know. You have questions, come to me. You're venting your anger at the wrong man, Chameleon. Mr. King didn't kill lguana. The masked man did it. Dan is dead, Moloch, because of your little tricks. There was never supposed to be a full transformation. I understand how you feel. But haven't I always told you emotional control is what this thing is about? Iguana never followed my instructions. Now, he would have made a full recovery if he'd had the chance. But the masked man took that chance away. And I promise you... ...that we will get revenge. Now, if anyone's scared, you can leave. No hard feelings. Mr. King would like to let you know what you'll be missing out on. Yes. After tonigh?s tragedy, our insurance people were horrified... ...but our investors see potential. A potential windfall, which would put another million... ...into each of your bank accounts. What do you say? That works for me. Is this our way out? Le?s just hope this don't lead to a dead end. You make me puke, King. Give her time, King. Nurse Logan, line two. Nurse Logan, line two. Dad, watch out! He's behind you. Move! Hurry! No! Here's our little hero. Dr. Marco Leung? Poor kid. Fortunately, he'll make it. I ran some blood tests. The results were negative. There's nothing wrong with his blood. - What are you checking for? - Genetic modifications. Like the wrestler who died. Do you have a fever? Maybe you should see a specialist. Yeah, I'm looking for one now. Marco? - They're waiting for us downstairs. - Yes. Le?s go. I'm asking you to dinner. I'm not asking you to sleep with me. I?s not the '90s. If i?s the '90s or the post-millennium, this is not happening. His real name is Daniel Martinez. Better known as the lguana. Huge man. Well, you haven't seen nothing yet. Hey, this is a hospital! We're only talking dinner. You know what my answer was, is and always will be. Look, I know you've got this thing. You can't stand being touched by men. Okay, okay, he's dead, but... Well, tha?s easy. All you have to do... ...when you're going out with me, is pretend that I'm dead. After five minutes of conversation I wouldn't have to pretend. We want our property back. Give it to me! Thanks. Now I'm gonna have fun with you. Oh, my God, inspector! They're fighting inside. I sent you the blood sample. - Don't... - No, listen to me. I need your help. Doctor? - Freeze! - Freeze! Her first patient out of medical school died... ...while she was giving him an injection. The patient grabbed her hand and didn't let go. Tha?s what happened. She's got this thing about men touching her. A phobia. Therapy for 6 months, and still. - Questions? - No. - Should have a specialist look at that. - I am looking for one now. I sent you the blood sample. Are you sure you got the right sample from the doctor? Positive. This blood shows genetic abnormalities, but i?s not lguana's blood. Someone else out there. Someone with more advanced technology. Someone who could be very useful to us. Why would you need anyone else? If my animal DNA strains are injected into the bloodstream of this individual... ...and successfully form a hybrid... ...then the problems that your friends have been having can be taken care of. They're not like you, Thorn. They need more energy to reach phase two. That is the solution. Trouble? - Don't you ever knock? - Sorry. I said no! No camera in my bedroom or in my bathroom! - But... - I said no! I know this is for my protection, but this is going way beyond my limits. I can't concentrate! I'm gonna go home, take a shower and relax. Are you a fan? He's my dad. He might be in the hospital, but he's the greatest. Well, I think he's pretty great too. - Really? - Yeah, really. You know, good guy, bad guy. I?s just a game. Why does everyone treat us like dirt? Are you hungry? Are you Black Mask? - Who is he? - He saved my life... ...but I never got a chance to thank him. - I have a feeling I'll run into him again. - Means you'll be in trouble again. Look, thanks for the food, but I need to get back to the hospital. Okay. I'll take you. Thanks, but we have to stop here. I have to sneak in. Well, where are you gonna sleep? Don't worry about me. I'll take care of myself. All right, but just in case, take your backpack. I'm sure your dad left something for you. The Black Avenger. Why don't you use " Black Mask"? Tha?s what the press nicknamed him. There's a problem. These nutball superhero wannabes, they all have hideouts. Like the " Mask Cave" or something. So we got to find him. You're not gonna have any trouble finding him. He wears a mask. Who knows who Black Mask is? We can have as many as we like. Name doesn't belong to him. He tries to use it, we got it copyrighted. We sue him. Sue him? Then we say ours is the real thing. And if he does not win next week's steel cage death match... ...then my name is not the King! And remember, kids. ; We got toys coming your way. We got the Black Mask car, the Black Mask action figure... ...we got the Black Mask winter outfit! Black Mask! Take off the mask. Tha?s what you look like? Take off the mask. And sign here. - I seek an audience with "The King." - Call my secretary. Okay, what do you want? I want my own personal trainer and my own dressing room. "The Black Mask. Star of the S.W.C.W." How's that sound? What do you say? Let me up! Let me up! Iguana. What did you do to him? It was Moloch! He used drugs! He spliced reptile DNA with human DNA. Just like the others. - Others? - Chameleon, the Claw... Others. The others! Who is this Moloch? Let me up. I'll tell you, I swear! Please! Please! Now, who is Moloch? I don't know! He came to me three years ago... ...when I was managing a women's mud wrestling... You're mine. The drug's working. Get him! He got away. Don't worry. He's one of us now. Three high-speed cables for the electronic microscope. Do we have them? Area 57, clear. Everyone spread out! He's around here somewhere! You doing this! Okay, you're seeing things again. Doctor! I need your help! This man from the wrestling federation, Moloch. The one who turned the wrestlers into hybrids. He did the same to me. I need your help to find a cure. Now more than ever. What should I do? Marco, look out! If you don't respond by "three," we're coming in! One, two, three! - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, i?s okay. Le?s go! Okay, heads I tell them, tails I don't. Heads! - Inspector? - Yes? Forget it. Stupid. Everyone! Hurry! I changed my mind. Hey, hey! Don't do that! Oh, God! Wha?s going on? Your clothes were torn. Bought you new ones. Did you borrow these from a close friend? - The stores around here, they... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Forget about it! All right, then, le?s get on with it. Get ready. I ain't right. What the hell is going on? Damn. I feel weird... Wha?s happening? Subject Claw. ; Terminal mutation in 46 hours 33 minutes. Subject Wolf. ; Terminal mutation in 34 hours 12 minutes. Subject Chameleon. ; Terminal mutation in 44 hours 7 minutes. We're damned. - I can't change back. - You ain't the only one. I'm stuck with this damn Wolfman face! Gonna cost them more than a million bucks to convince me this is cool now. Wonderful. The level of transformation is perfect. - You're a liar! - No. No. No. You gentlemen are right on schedule. We can't change back! Wait a minute, you knew this was gonna happen? How come you can change back and we can't? So, what the hell did you do to him that you didn't do to us? I?s just a matter of stages. Thorn, explain it to them. He used plant DNA on me and animal DNA on you. Plants create energy, animals don't. But he found that in an animal DNA subject... ...the host can supply itself with enough energy. With energy, phase-one transformations will no longer be unstable. With the next level no longer affected by emotions, you will gain complete control. Stop with the science lesson! So how long until we reach the next stage? To get to the next stage, you need an injection. To make the serum... ...I need iridium. I don't have iridium. But I know a place where we could... ...borrow some. You are an enhanced human, Kan Fung... ...who will be sold to the most powerful corporations in the world. But if you escape from me, I will find you and destroy you. I will find you and destroy you. I think I can slow down the DNA replication, but only temporarily. I might need a radioisotope to do it, but I might not. We'll just have to see. I don't like feeling as if I'm an experiment. So you want a sample? What? No. You mean, right here? Of course, right here. I didn't think a doctor would be afraid of a little blood. Right. You're gonna have to do it yourself because I can't touch you! You were talking about a radioisotope. Something you needed to make the cure permanent. Iridium. I?s part of my suppressor experiment. Coming to B Harbor tonight as part of a Red Cross shipment. But it can be used in both ways. Either as a suppressor... ...or to strengthen a reaction. - Iridium. - Wait! - I said I'm not sure. - The sample's on the table. What are you guys looking at? - ID, please. - I'll get the papers. Wolf! Papers! - Hey, what is this shit? - Did I forget to sign? Control, control! Oh, my God. Le?s put him in the van and finish this ourselves. He's nuts. He's gonna get out and go right back after this elephant. Why don't we tie him up and put him in a bag? He's coming with us. You keep an eye on him. - Why me? - Because I said so! Because I said so. Come on. Le?s go. - What do you think of this one? - Not bad. A bit skinny. The one with the leather suit... - What is the password? - Never. Tha?s voice-activated. Not a retinal scanner. Your eyes mean more to you than to me. Wha?s the password? - Harvest! - Enter. Harvest time. - Is this it? - Yeah! - What is it? - Hospital-grade iridium. Just what we need to straighten up that damn Snake. Where is Snake? Next time can we break into someplace with money? You never know. Life is long. Damn! Look at that! Tha?s gross! I thought Wolf was watching him. Spit him out! You are so getting on my nerves, Snake. Get ahold of yourself, Wolf! Shit! Le?s get this sucker, Wolfie! Get back here! We need the iridium! Damn freaks! Don't think we need those nets. Le?s call the cherry pickers. Come on. Get in there! Go! Go! Cease fire! Cease fire! Hey! Black Mask is over here! Go get him! Go! Move! Move! This had better work. Kan? Is that you? Cure... Don't touch me. Don't... Cure! Cure... Now... Losing control. Mask, you are not gonna die on me. Mask? Black Mask. Just when I thought I lost you and your little doctor friend. Listen to me! No time for that. Don't even think about it! Stop! I said stop it! Get out of the way. This is between me and him. No. You did this to my dad. And I won't let that happen again. He's a murderer. I loved Dan. You don't understand this feeling yet! Don't make me fight you too. No, you don't understand. Black Mask saved me from lguana. Iguana was trying to kill me. You're just like him. You're the murderer. Do you know what was going on in his mind when he let go of my hand? If you keep on like this, one day you won't be able to turn back. You'll disappear, just fade away. Find a cure for yourself while you still have some control. Moloch won't help you. Okay, Moloch. You kept your promise. Get some rest, boys. We'll do some more tests tomorrow. Welcome to the next stage of evolution. Kan! Sorry. What happened to you? Well, I saw you down there... ...and then I tried to run down and go after you, but... - How do you feel? - Good. I feel good. And tha?s another thing I owe you. Don't be too optimistic. Without iridium, my suppressor can't separate... ...normal from abnormal DNA. You can control it, but... There's still an animal in me. Yeah. I?s funny the way you put it. Well, it can't be worse than not feeling anything. I'm not even human. Did you feel that? No... ...not exactly. Did you? No, no. Not a thing. - We should try again. - No. For science. Okay. Raymond! Hi. - What are you doing here? - Tha?s my partner. Come on. Why is there always a sidekick? And besides, he's underage. He's quite all right. You have called for me, Zeus? Very observant of you, Lang. You have a chance to redeem yourself. I have located Kan Fung. Where? These events took place in B city, in full view of the press. Interesting. What is this thing he's fighting with? Obviously an enhanced human. Primitive job, as you can see. I want you to find the man responsible. See if he can be bought. We don't want amateurs interfering in our business. And if he refuses? U se the usual method. - We will leave immediately, Zeus. - Lang? Yes. Kan Fung must not get away this time. I don't want him exposed to the public lik e this. The prodigal son must return. Do you question my orders? - No. - You and Kan Fung are much alik e. - You also have seeds of betrayal in you. - I swear to you, Zeus, I do not. Do not fail me. This is your last chance. At the Pranaya Military Research Center, several grams of californium were stolen. This situation has been judged critical by several observers. They say this is an ominous sign given last nigh?s theft of iridium. Judged critical, as a simple bullet made from these unstable elements... ...could create a nuclear explosion. A 30-meter symbol of the Shadow Group... Is that a snake? No. I?s the Greek letter "Z." Zeta. It stands for "Zeus." Zeus? Who's that? Leader of the Shadow Group. My creators. Who the hell are you? I'm a man who thinks you're wasting your talents, doctor. Talent I can put to much better use. Lang and Moloch. Apocalypse meets inferno. You have in your possession a large quantity of iridium. You lack the element to do something grand with it. - This situation has been judged... - Californium and iridium. A biochemical catalyst and a radioactive element. Know where this is leading? - They're making a bomb. - A DNA bomb. They've got enough of that stuff to turn all of B city into a zoo. This is Lang's style. All this just to get to me. Where are they gonna do this? If they want me, it will be the most obvious place. There. Done. Iridium and californium. We'll have a big show in the arena tonight. Genetic apocalypse, and only Black Mask to stop it. You think he'll show? Does the dog speak without the master's permission? Will he show? Kan, " Black Mask," as you call him... ...has very little sense of self-preservation. He'll come because he thinks he's needed. And when he does, I'll take care of him. We don't need your tricks. I hear the dog barking again, Moloch. Your creatures don't know to be quiet in the presence of their superiors. Time's up. Live or die? I decide who lives and dies in this lab, not you. Let him go. Now! Life it is. Your brain is useful to me. Tha?s the only reason you're alive. Do you understand? Doctor, are you sure you can get into the system? Every code can be broken, Troy. A protection device. Always full of surprises, Moloch. - What do we do now? - Find Black Mask. Tha?s not gonna be easy. What about reports that your fighter, Black Mask, is dangerous? They are absolutely true. Black Mask, known as " Blackie" to his friends... ...is one of the three most vicious fighters alive today. Which is why tonight he will be coming face-to-face... ...with the other two: Claw and Wolf! I'll murderize them! He's an imposter! - How many Black Masks are there? - There is only one Black Mask. That man is a fake! He's the fake. You've been conned. So go home. There won't be any show tonight! Take off that damn mask! Where are we going? We're following him. Maybe he can lead us to the detonator. Get you, no matter how long it takes me. - You did this to him? - Indeed. I got rid of the parts that were useless to me. All I needed was his brain. So did you enjoy your energy drinks? What was in it? I?s a poison that accelerates your heart rate till it explodes. Poison? You poisoned us. Black Mask is here. Enough time to get Black Mask. You do this for me and the antidote is yours. I guess so. Le?s do it. Mask? Where are you? - Aren't we here to help Black Mask? - Tha?s not funny, Raymond! Look. - Where? - Up there! Maybe we can stop that jerk! Hurry! Now we have to wait. Hey, over here! Ready for some action? I could take you with one hand! - Now! - Got you! Raymond! Do something! I was just kidding. You're not after me, right? You're after Black Mask! I will terminate all those who help Black Mask! Marco? Are you alive? Marco? Are you okay? Come on, answer me! Yes, I'm alive. I think. Moloch, what did you do to me? Remember lguana. I will never disappear. You must hold on. This time you die. Now, weren't you supposed to bring me back alive? I'm tired of this. Zeus will understand. He needs me more than you. Whatever you do... ...you're still going to die. This is the end of your journey, Dr. Lang. I have to go on with mine. Dr. Leung! Dr. Marco! Do you have any comments? - Hi! - Hi. - This is my dad. - Tell Black Mask thanks for everything. I will. Your son was very brave. You should be proud. I am. Can you give this to him? I?s our address. Hope he can write us back. He will. I'll make sure of it. - Dr. Marco Leung. - Are you alone? - Yes. Where are you? - You are not safe yet. I'm not? - You're still under my protection. - I see. Isn't this a kidnapping? - No more silly costumes this time, okay? - Hold tight.
