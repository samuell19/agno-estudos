I remember Mom named me Chaladlert because I was born on the same date as Thomas Alva Edison. It means intelligent. Mom wanted me to be as bright as him. I was raised to be observant. I'm curious about everything. And, sometimes, that curiosity leads me to strange things. It's quite unusual. Yeah. Oh, my God! A STUDY INTO ANIMAL BREEDING And when I find bizarre stuff I don't understand, I always rely on the most experienced member in the family. What the hell. Can't hear nothing. It's broken again. I'm so done with this. Grandpa! There's something wrong with a woman in the VCD. She makes weird sounds. She sounds like that, Grandpa. Aiya! I can't hear anything, Chaladlert. Can you speak up? -Louder! -Oh, my God! One more time. Louder! More! -Come on. -Bang me! Don't stop. Bang me! Then my parents passed away. I mean, two years after that. Since then, Aunt Balloon has stepped in to take care of the house. Aunt Balloon is single. Since she's taking care of me and Grandpa, I haven't seen her going out with anyone. She takes care of me like my mom. So I'm very close to her. I tell her and Grandpa everything. And I mean, everything... even... It's here! Aunt Balloon! Grandpa! It's here! Aiya! You got your pubes! 15+ IQ Krachoot Grandpa once told me, "Life doesn't begin at a certain age. It begins whenever you realize it." I never really got it until I'm 15. But you know what most 15-year-old kids care about? Hey, what do you guys think it's like when a penis penetrates a vagina? O-Beu, no need to use those fancy terms. Just say cock and pussy. O-Yong, you don't get it. I use them to avoid obscenity. It's a scientific question. Scientific? Hey, hold on, I'm studying it. And why do you need to use my elbow as a pussy? Because O-Yong's elbow doesn't fit in the experiment. Your elbow is perfect, Chaladlert. It's fair and smooth. It's the ideal pussy. It provides realistic touch. Chaladlert, don't be so hard on O-Yong. I read a study paper. It said that men think about sex every 52 seconds. O-Yong's just a man. It's totally normal for him to be this horny. As you can see, there are many things a 15-year-old's interested in. But for O-Yong and O-Beu, the only thing they wanna do is obsessing over sex. They often use their brains to gain sexual benefits. You can say they're horny nerds. -Are you tired or hungry? -It slipped out of my hands, Miss. Let me help. Sorry, Miss. Don't worry. -Are you okay? -Yes. Pomelos. Janejira's are pomelos. -Watermelons. -Watermelons. Cotton's are watermelons. Eggs. -Steamed buns. -Steamed buns. If you two don't stop messing around, you'll lose to Sudarat. Stop saying her name. I'm sick of seeing her face on the board every day. CONGRATULATIONS TO SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG In the study paper I read, women think about sex once a day. I think Sudarat probably thinks about sex three times a day. What? When? At noon, for example. She watches the seniors play basketball. I think she's there for the smell. The smell of the sweat arouses her deeply. Apart from that, Sudarat must be thinking about sex when she's licking an ice cream cone. A virgin like Sudarat must be wondering what a penis feels like. And the moment Sudarat thinks about sex the most is when she wakes up. What? Why is that? Well, normally when men wake up, they have an erection. Women have that, too! But women don't have penises. Where can they get an erection? Nipples! You can see their nipples erect through their pajamas in the morning. You're talking nonsense, right? I'll go study now. Sudarat! What's on your arm? Nothing. SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG You're always messing around. That's why you never succeed in anything. -Was that a dig at us? -Not at me. Sudarat... is someone who's always the best in everything she does. Well, she really lives up to her name. Because Sudarat means a perfect lady. But it's also this perfection that makes people dislike Sudarat. And to make the matter worse, teachers use Sudarat as a standard for skirt length measurement. Inappropriate. Shorter or longer than hers means inappropriate. Too long. Inappropriate. Sudarat is considered a good student, praised by every teacher. Especially,... Miss Janya's here. Attention, please. -Good morning, Miss. -Sit down. Do you know? When doctors make a mistake, a patient dies. When pilots makes a mistake, all passengers die. But when teachers make a mistake, the future of a country's gone. Every one of you is the nation's future. Therefore, I have the responsibility to improve you. I'd like you all to know that getting to wear the uniform of this school is a great honor. That's why you must keep improving. The last thing I want to talk about during this homeroom... is this year's Science Project Competition. The team behind the selected project will get a chance to participate in a seminar in Japan. Wow, Japan! Silence! And this year's topic is... an invention when you're 30. This topic aims to make you understand how adults think, to urge you to learn to think like adults. We don't want student projects anymore. But we're still 15-16 years old. How can we understand a 30-year-old? Well, that's the objective. We want you to grow up, Chaladlert. O-Beu, let's go grab a bite. Suchada. -I'll tell you a secret. -I'm hungry. -Let's go eat something. -Actually, I have a crush on one of my classmates. She's the reason why I try to excel at school so that I get to be in the same class as her. But last semester, LAST SEMESTER Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Anyway, do you want this book? Oh, no problem. You can have it. I read it so many times. You like science fiction? Yes. I love sci-fi movies as well. Especially Spielberg's and Nolan's. I love Spielberg, too. What's your favorite? E.T.? I really love it. Yes! I love it, too. I'm so obsessed with aliens. That's why I love it. And you, Chaladlert, you think aliens are real? You know my name? Yeah, of course. We're classmates. That's true. And do you even know my name? Of course! Cherry Suchada Ngamkanokwan! Wow, you know my full name. Nickname, first name and last name. I think it must be so beautiful on Saturn. It's probably orange... I think it'd be cool if we have a lot of alien friends. You ever wanna go there? Although Cherry looks more like a half-Caucasian, she has this weird provincial accent. But that's the reason why everyone likes her, including me. Hey! What's the matter? No, nothing. Hey, Cherry. Do you feel a bit cold? Not really, it's actually kinda hot. Oh, I got it. Hey, have you watched 2001: A Space Odyssey? This one. Oh, the best sci-fi movie of all time? Yeah. It's such a complex story. I don't really understand it. Especially the part where there's this black and long thing. Do you understand it? Oh. The black and long... you mean the black monolith? It's a feeling I'd never known before. The texture feels like an orange, a potato fruit or a tomato. It's like a new territory for me. You pervert! Even now, I still ask myself, why didn't I just ask Cherry to pick up that pen? I don't know how my brains told me to do that to Cherry. Since then, I haven't had any guts to talk to her. It feels like my high school life's over. Chaladlert. We only have one-hour lunch break. You should go do something useful rather than sitting here. I'm saying this as your class rep. Umm... -What? -All right. Hey, for this year's science project, if we copy the idea in this book, we'll get to go to Japan for sure. Wanna microspore to ovule? No, Top. That's Top. The most handsome senior in the school. Every girl says that he's even more handsome than some superstars. Goddamn hot. You can tell even from behind. He's the school's treasure. The senior girls rules that he must be a public figure for everyone to share. That means no one can go out with him because he's a public treasure. Top! Top! When will he finish washing? He's a mermaid or what? Suchada. I'll take the trash out, okay? Okay, got it. Cherry, please stop. I saw you today at the library. You can't go out with Top. He's a public figure. He can't love you. It's my business. Mind your own. But I like you, Cherry. I really like you. I like you a lot. Thank you. But I like older men. I like someone who's smarter. You seem like a good guy. But you're really not my type. What if I won the Science Project Competition? Will you give me a chance then? It's irrelevant. It will be a proof that I'm more mature and smarter like Top. So you stop getting involved with a public figure. If you wanna beat me in the Science Project Competition, you need to beat Sudarat as well. Because we're on the same team. O-Beu, what size is the biggest boob size? I did some research. It's Cup E. You wanna know why? O-Beu. O-Yong. Let's submit a science project. I think we'll nail it. We used to build a rocket. Remember? You mean Chuwit No.7? Don't you remember what happened to that? TRIAMPARINYA Launch the rocket. Standby for the launch. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. There it goes. Yeah! Yeah! It's up there! Wow, it worked. The rocket! Watch out! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey! Don't come back to Daddy! Spread your legs, Miss! It's coming back! Chuwit, you've done well! Move! Hold on, that's not what happened. Damn, I really thought you were good, O-Yong. You're good with rockets. I'm good with rockets. But I mean cock rocket. Not funny? Damn, Chaladlert. We can never beat Sudarat anyway. We're not as smart as her. Since we can't beat Sudarat, why don't we steal her brains? Steal her invention plan. Make it ours and beat her in the end. Well, I think... that's probably not a good idea. But my plan is not only to steal her idea, but to also ruin her academically. Have you ever been warned by adults? Don't fall in love while in school because it'll ruin your future. I think this theory's perfect. Sudarat has never been in love. And if you make her fall for you... She won't be able to focus at school because she's obsessed with him? But she's not into anyone. How could you know? She likes you, Chaladlert. O-Yong, have you seen my Chemistry notebook? No. Oh, I totally forgot, Chaladlert. Sudarat kept the notebook for you. Can I have my notebook? You probably haven't noticed but I've seen it for a while. Chaladlert is the only guy in school that Sudarat keep things for. She's just keeping things for me. That doesn't mean she likes me. Besides, I don't know how to flirt. Yeah, Sudarat looks kinda dull. Probably hard to flirt with. I figured that out. Smart girls' problem is... Small boobs because they overuse their brains. So the boobs shrink. Shrink my ass. A problem with Sudarat is that she has low estrogen levels. Low estrogen levels in women result in low sex drive. Sudarat has low estrogen levels. Hence, low sex drive. I see. So if Sudarat has higher estrogen levels, she'll have normal levels of sex drive. Your plan is so sick and evil. That's how I like it. You can count me out. -What's wrong with him? -No idea. Yes. Yes. I'm almost there. Okay. Vice. 70 percent of 15-year-old boys that come home this late engage in some vice. Not me. Really? What about that Cherry thing? CHALADLERT 0 SUDARAT 1 It's not like what you think. I know you didn't mean it. It's me who told Cherry that it was just an accident. Naive boys like you don't have dirty thoughts. CHALADLERT 0 SUDARAT 2 I heard you're submitting a project. Why's that? Cherry told you? I know everything. So, about Top... Top? What about him? That means you don't really know everything that's going on at school. CHALADLERT 1 SUDARAT 2 Yeah. I'm not a nosy type. CHALADLERT 1 SUDARAT 100 But, this year, I'll beat you! Wanna microspore to ovule? Wanna microspore to ovule? CHERRY: DID YOU SAY SOMETHING TO SUDARAT? CHALADLERT: NO, I DIDN'T. CHERRY: SHE'S PRESSING ME ABOUT TOP. CHERRY: PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE. CHERRY: IT'S MY BUSINESS. CHALADLERT: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. CHERRY: THIS USER'S BLOCKED YOU. Hold on a minute. What is microspore to ovule? SEARCH OR PASTE URL MICROSPORE TO OVULE Microspore to ovule, put simply, is sexual reproduction in cherry blossoms. No! To prevent Cherry from "microspore to ovule" with Top, I really need to win this year's Science Project Competition. Sympathetic activity. What does that mean? Lately, have you been experiencing increased heart rate? When you get your heart broken, you feel the pain in your heart because the brains induce sympathetic activity, sending your heart into overdrive. You mean about Cherry? Don't worry. You'll adjust in three-four days. The symptoms of sympathetic activity will subside. And about winning the competition to prove yourself... let me tell you, that's nuts. What do you mean? I don't get it. Nuts also means insanely stupid. I think that's stupid of you. So you're nuts. Just you wait, Sudarat. This year,... my friends and I will win the competition! Aunt Balloon. Aunt Balloon. Aunt Balloon. Shit! Hey, help me! -Come on! -Damn. Hey, piggy! Oh, my God. Are you okay, piggy? It's alright. I'm okay. So can I help you with anything? Here's the thing, Aunt. Our project's topic is "an invention when you're 30." So we think the only way to win the competition is to find out how a 30-year-old thinks. And you happen to be of that age. So my friends think that... You can probably help us understand adults. If it was you, how would you think? What would you do? It'd be our starting point. Oh, give me a minute, okay? Take as long as you want. This is nice. Hey, I got something! So people in their 30s often worry about their figures, and appearances. Their skin's not as good as when they were in their 20s. I think you guys should invent some kind of a facial device. For anti-aging. Rewind a 30-year-old back to 20. Isn't it cool? How about that? So what's now? Scientists must have plan Bs. Since the interview didn't work, we're forced to use our eyes to gather information about a 30-year-old. Are you two studying her behavior or what? Very thoroughly. O-Yong, imagine with some censor blur on. Everything looks dirty with censor blur. Can you stop with the dirty looks? Your vision will be blurry. I wanna eat that durian. Later on, everyone at school started their science projects. However, I'm still wondering whether their ideas could really be considered as an invention when we're 30. Why staring at the spoon? Theoretically, human beings only use the left brain for logic and analysis. So I came up with an idea to cut down the use of my left brain and use the right brain more for intuition and creativity. It would increase balance in your brain and turn a "Homo Simple" into a "Homo Excellent." "Homo Excellent"? That's your big man's invention, Pratya? Awesome, right? This year... you can forget about Sudarat. You could improve your brain much more, just stare at something else. What? You must use your brain to channel the energy to lift the skirts of intern teachers. If you think like this, your right brain will work harder and your left brain'll be less active. And your brain'll develop much faster. Damn, O-Beu, you're a genius! See? He could come up with something even though it's nonsense. You can come up with something but it's not a winning idea! If his idea wins, it's the doom of our nation. So what do you guys wanna do? A band-aid? It's not just a normal band-aid. In the US, there are band-aids with microneedle patch as an alternative to needles. -You imported it for this cause? -No, I made it myself. I put some estrogen liquid on it. We just need to make a cut on Sudarat and put the band-aid on. Her estrogen levels will go up. So will her sex drive. Such a simple but badass plan! I like that. But how can we make a cut on Sudarat? Lower the body, feet together, lift the leg, arm's out, crimp fingers. Sword next to ear. This semester, Miss Janya teaches Thai sword dance. -Next to ear. -Go near her. -Accidently hurt her. -Lower the body. -Lift and attack. -Chaladlert, go distract her. You must impress her. Just move closer to her. -Crimp fingers, sword next to ear. -Accidently hurt her. Chaladlert'd pretend to help her by putting the band-aid on. What do I do? You go and practice the dance. Show her how cool you are. -I'll go to the bathroom, okay? -All right. You can do it! But... -Chaladlert, you can do it. -Chaladlert, you can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. -You can do it. Damn it! Feet together, lift the leg, attack, sword next to ear. Left the leg, attack. Lift the leg, feet together. Lift the leg, lower the body, feet together, lift the leg, attack. What the hell are you doing? I'm practicing my sword dance. Isn't that cool? Sudarat. Umm... I wanna thank you for... always keeping my notebook for me. That's it? If that's all then you can go now. I'm gonna practice. Umm... Sudarat... I don't know how to flirt... Can you help me with that? What do you mean? Well, the flirt... as in this dance move. What the... Oh! -Move! -All right. Here's the attack! May the Force be with you. You're attacking my friend? You'll regret it! -Shit, blood! -You deserved it. You attacked me first. Where's my backup? Shit! Oh, you got a band-aid. Put it on your friend. I'm fine. Never mind. Wait! -Whoa! -Shit! Why is he here? No need to thank me. You're welcome. But I'm screwed. Well,... Cherry, let's go. Just leave them here. I gotta go. -O-Beu, when will it work? -Don't worry. I used a small amount of it. Don't worry, O-Yong. O-Beu! -O-Beu! -This is not good, Chaladlert. We must turn O-Yong off. -O-Beu! -Chaladlert, attack the target. Hey, hold on! Stop, assholes! I was just kidding! Why are you beating me up? The low amount can't affect me! Be realistic! Yeah, I know that. I just wanna beat you up. I'm glad you're okay, O-Yong. O-Beu, now that our plan failed, what do we do next? Scientists must have plan Bs. It's always beautiful up here. I haven't been here in a while. Cherry. I... I wanna ask about you and Top again. Me and Top? I already explained that. I still don't get it. I tried to come up with reasons why you'd do it. But it doesn't really help. -And... -Just cut to the chase. Why did you do that kinda thing with Top? You must know in your heart that Top is a public figure and one day... he may dump you. Thanks for your concern. But, sometimes, there are things you can't really understand no matter how hard you try. Especially when it comes to love. I don't really know how it will be between Top and me. But I just follow my feelings. I don't get you at all. You know, even if you read Romance of the Three Kingdoms for ten times, you'll never understand love. -But... -Forget it. Even if you finish the novel, it's nothing compared to being in love yourself. This is for you. That's perfect. I'm really sleepy. Thanks! You're welcome. Goodbye. It's so sharp. I told you my plan would work. Fruits with citric acid boost sex drive. But I think... -it's not a good idea, guys. -If you're still not sure, we can do the experiment on people with slowest reactions first. -Hey, this is for you. -Thanks. Oh, I'm too late. So sharp. Fruits with citric acid surely boost sex drive. I have another plan up my sleeves. Chaladlert, you have to pretend that you like Sudarat and bring her some snacks. When her crush brings her snacks, surely, she'll be delighted and feeling hopeful for love. Just because of these sex-drive boosting citrus fruits? Sudarat. I bought it for you. I'm not Cherry. Don't play nice to me. But I really meant to buy you these citrus fruits. But I like red beans, corns, pumpkins with unsaturated fat like linoleic acid and oleic acid. They also contain serotonin that helps you relax. But these fruits also contain Vitamin C. Do you know? Reading a historical novel really makes you smart and see through cheap tricks. What's your agenda? I really don't have an agenda. If you don't believe me, I can taste it for you. Hey, it's getting dark soon. You guys are not going home? Why don't you go home together? You're going the same way. Chaladlert, let's go home. Sorry. Plot twist, O-Yong. Chaladlert did it! And what's your secret plan, you jackass? Sudarat. I remember that she was so cute back then. But she's changed a lot. Although we live in the same neighborhood and I often run into her, she's still somewhat unpredictable to me. Hurry up. Okay. Why did you ask me to join you on the way home? I wanna walk quietly. Can we not talk? Here. Hold these for me. Sorry. So how is it going with your project? Oh,... I haven't come up with anything yet. Okay. What about yours? It's about the origin of life. Why did you choose that topic? I believe in a theory that life came to Earth on a meteorite. Meteorites are like buses in the universe. Ingredients for life might've been on those meteorites. Life might've started after meteorites crashed to Earth. From unicellular organism, over many million years, it evolved into us. As well as other beautiful things. Life is fascinating, don't you think? That's why I chose it. Wanna hang with me? What? My mom's not at home. And I'm doing some experiment. I want your input. All right. You brought me to your bedroom... I don't think it's a good idea. -I like that it's private. -What? Private? Yeah. Hey, sit down. -Yeah. -Hey. Why did you sit there? Come here. All right. You're so nervous. Not cool and calm like your name suggests. I'm sorry. Anyway, speaking of names, we're quite weird, right? Both of us don't have nicknames. My mom refused to give me one. She even told me not to have a nickname. Your mom probably wants you to be a perfect lady like your name. Well, that kinda makes sense. How did you come up with that? When my mom was still around, she told me the same thing. She wanted me to be intelligent. Now it's more like the opposite of that. Not as cool as when you were five. I was cool when I was five? You still remember these pants? When I saw those pants, I recognized them right away. I recalled that day at the playground when I was five. You peed yourself. You peed yourself. You peed yourself. You peed yourself. You peed yourself. You peed yourself. You were my hero at that time. So... what's that experiment you talked about? AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD So what are we doing now? I'm dissecting a squid to study its genitals. When squids mate, a male'd release a capsule of sperm into a female. And I wonder where the genitals could be on this flat squid. So I'm dissecting it. But I haven't found it. And why do you wanna know this? Because since I saw yours when you were five, I've been wondering about male genitals. I haven't had any chance to see any since. That's why I study on animals instead. But now that you're here, let me study you, okay? Sudarat! Suda... Don't be alarmed. I'm just studying it. What is this part called? Sudarat! Suda... rat. That's too tight. This Sunday, come and help me write the Biology report here. I have to come again? All right. Hey, how come mine is smaller? Your dildo is based on Thai standard size. -It's as good as it gets. -Fine. I'll prove that sizes don't matter. Sudarat touched me! -Sudarat touched my dick! -What? She even forced me to help her with her homework at home this Sunday. You know what? You need to learn about sex. What? Where can I do that? Scientists must have top secret plans. GOING TO THE DOCTOR. SEE YOU TONIGHT. To clear the way so I can learn about sex, I had to destroy Grandpa's hearing aid to get my aunt and him out of the the house. Now we can start our mission. However,... Chaladlert, do we really need to dress like this? O-Beu said, "Wear your dads' clothes." So we look more mature. We lied about our age. Yeah, I know. But look at what that jerk's wearing. O-Beu, you told me to wear my dad's clothes. Why a t-shirt with your mom's face? Well, this is my dad's t-shirt. He owns a collection. My parents are madly in love. Yeah? I thought that's a funeral pic. Hey, is this really a good idea? To do this in broad daylight? Dude, she's here. The door's not locked. Come in. I normally take clients at night. But I saw that you guys are just kids. You shouldn't go to bed late. We're old enough to have sexual intercourse, have a family and children. I'm not a kid anymore. Yeah, I believe you. So do we do it one by one or all together at the same time? -All together. -All together. O-Yong! -My little piggy! -Can you moan in a deep voice? O-Beu! Deep enough for you? I'm tired now. Please move to Chaladlert. Chaladlert! O-Yong! My name's O-Yong! Oh, yeah! Chaladlert! O-Beu! O-Yong! I've been watching videos. I finally got to see the real thing. Please moan my name. O-Yong! O-Yong! Oh, yeah! O-Yong! Next step. This is a VR headset. You'll discover porn in 3D. In all its glory. You'll get to experience it like you're having sex yourself. Seriously? This is how you learn about sex? I wanna know why we're doing all of this. It has nothing to do with stealing. You must distract her by flirting with and seducing her before stealing the plan. If you succeed, you could even make her come up with another project! It's a win-win. You can never lose. Just put it on and it'll feel like the real thing? Come here, boy. I feel so hot. Unbutton me, will you? My hands are full. That's better. Thank you. So what is the last stop of this bus? Oh, Makkasan. Where am I? You're in Makkasan. And what are we doing here? Makkasan. Makkasan is for making love. Is that right? Hey, bro. Yeah? Can you help me? I want you to decide whether to untie me or help look if there's something under my skirt. All right. See anything? Help me! How can I help you? We're all worried we may have breast cancer. Can you check our breasts? Shouldn't you go to the doctor? There's no one here. Only you can help us. -Really? -Please? -Please! -Please! -Please! -I'm not sure I can. -Umm... -Please! -Please help me. -Please. It's so realistic, guys. Me again? It's always me! Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting! What the hell are you guys doing? I think I'm scared of Sudarat. Why should you be? She's stalking you like this. It means she likes you. I think her hormones are all over the place. But are liking someone and sexual feelings the same thing? It's a chain reaction. But how can I be aroused if I don't like Sudarat? -Right. -Right. And if I really like her? -Wanna do it? -What? What are we doing? The Biology paper. Have you finished your Physics paper? Oh, yeah. We can start now. Okay. Reproduction and development. I wanna add some facts about animals. You think it's a good idea? Yeah. Oh, I read it somewhere that when flatworms mate, they do this "penis fencing." -Flatworms, right? -Okay. Oh, pandas, as well The zoo staff must show pandas some panda porn to arouse them. What? But why do they do that? Because pandas only think about sex 24-72 hours a year. To prevent extinction, they must be aroused to reproduce. Isn't that funny? I don't know what happened. Everything's blurry. I can't remember anything. Next thing I know,... I've lost my virginity to Sudarat. There's no blood at all. How can I know for sure that I lost my virginity? No idea. Sudarat. Umm... can I ask you something? I mean why... did we... Ever since I was little... I never really understand why my dad left my mom and me. So I never believe in relationships. I put all my energy into studying. But now... I started to feel something... when I'm close to you. I wanna believe in relationships again. O-YONG: YOU GOT THE PLAN? AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT AT 30? Even though I got Sudarat's plan, my feelings somehow prevent me from following up with my plan. I don't know whether I feel guilty or feel something about Sudarat. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I got the plan. Hey, you guys. I think... Apart from the plan, you also got something else, right? Yeah, I got the Biology paper done. Just the Biology paper? Didn't you also work on Physiology? Explain it to me in details. What steps did you take? What steps? Steps to sexual intercourse! What? Hold on. That's not the point. What about the science project? That's a sub topic. Sexual intercourse is the main topic. So we have to discuss about methods of sexual intercourse and every step in details. So you asked me to go steal Sudarat's plan for what? To troll her, Chaladlert. But I never thought that it would come this far. You're the man, Chaladlert! So when you lost your virginity to her... what did it feel like? Sudarat! Sudarat, let me go! I... I... I... I won't say anything. I'm on to your stupid game. I know that you wanted to steal my plan but I just wanted to see if you're that kind of guy. So I let you. I also wanted to see if I could put up with it. Now I know! Sudarat! Let me explain, Sudarat! Sudarat got me every time! -O-Beu, you have to come up with plan B. -Don't worry. Scientists must have... What? Do you feel something, too? I'm not done with you guys yet! No... Since that day, I haven't talked to Sudarat at all. I know she's mad. I feel bad myself. But I don't know what to do. I... BIOLOGY ONE MONTH LATER Hey. You have any problems with Sudarat? You know that Sudarat likes you, right? What do you really think about her? You know full well who I like. But now... I'm not sure anymore. And I don't really know how I feel. Whatever you decide, just do it before it's too late. Don't worry. Scientists always have plan Bs. What plan Bs are you talking about? NA CI You know what it means, right? So what? You're sodium. I'm chlorine. Together, it's sodium chloride. It's essential for life. I need you in my life, Sudarat. I'm sorry. CI You still know about embryo? Oh, it's the early developmental stage of animals or plants. I'm pregnant. CI But don't worry, I have a plan B. But... how is that possible? Hey, snap out of it. Tell my mom first and then your family, okay? Wait. This is such a big deal. I'm too afraid to tell them. You know, Mom has high hope for me. But then something like this happened. What do you think she'd say? You and your friends planned to ruin my life. And now... you're really ruining it. SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG Will you answer me now? Why did this happen to you? I had such high hope for you. BUTTON YOUR UNIFORM PROPERLY LIKE SUDARAT Why is Miss Janya late today? Can you reach her? Not yet. Attention, please! -Good morning, Miss. -Good morning, Miss. I have an announcement to make. Sudarat, your class representative, asked for a semester leave. Therefore, Suchada will become the project leader instead. Take your book out. Let's begin. 10TH GRADE, CLASS 1 Chaladlert. What's wrong with Sudarat? We haven't even submitted any plans. I'm scared of her now. Chaladlert! Hey, Chaladlert. Umm... I would like to... Well, we discussed it at home. We talked about what happened. And we'd like to take care of the baby. What baby? There's no baby here. What does that mean? I'm begging you. You can't do that. Please. You guys should leave. -We decided to have an abortion. -No, Sudarat! That's a human being! Don't be so naive! In science, it's just a cell. It's just a tissue even. Are we done now? See yourself out. I can't believe this. How could did happen, Chaladlert? If your parents knew, they would be very disappointed in me. Balloon, don't blame yourself like that. We must not blame anyone. It's not really anyone's fault. The most important thing is, Chaladlert, what are you going to do now? I'm feeling hurt. Hurt inside, Grandpa. But I don't know what it is. I just know that... I'm responsible for this. CENTER OF MASS So, what is it like to be an adult? If you ask me, I think life is just like a scientific experiment. You need to experiment time and again. Sometimes, you succeed. Sometimes, you fail. No matter how many times you fail, you must go on. I've been experimenting for 60-70 years. Yet, I still don't know whether I'm a good adult. WHEN YOU'RE 30? What's on your mind? Hey, you can tell us anything. Your aunt's worried about you. If you wanna create that adult invention, what would you do? I think the topic of the project is too complicated for me to understand. If it was me, I'd do what I like. To be honest, I don't really get that topic anyway. But that's not the big problem anymore. You're right, O-Beu. The science project's not the problem but it may be the question that leads to my answer. I really need to know what our adult invention is. -What do we do? -What do we do? Scientists must always have plan Bs. AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30? What if... there wasn't anything that represented what we'd invent when we're 30? Therefore,... the definition of being an adult may not really exist. It may be just a theory that people came up with. What are you talking about, dude? I don't get it. I know now what my adult invention is. All right. Just tell me what you wanna do. Yeah, I don't dare to offer any ideas anymore. So what is it? The invention when we're 30. What do we have to do? Let's do something we do best. AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30? Sudarat, if you hear me, I wanna tell you I know what my invention when I'm 30 is. Sudarat! Sudarat! Take your goddamn rocket out of my house! Chaladlert, don't waste time. Let's launch the rocket. SUDARAT 8 Ready, Chaladlert? Five. Four. Three. Two. One. That's it. That's what we do best. -Being a loser! -Chaladlert, go! -Come on! -Come on! Stop! -Miss! -Hold on. -Whoa! -Whoa! Hey! When will you stop with these shenanigans? I'm sorry. I... I just wanna show you my invention plan. It's empty. Yes, it's an empty plan. Because the invention is still in your womb. If we turn 30... the cell in your womb would be 15 years old like us now. This 15-year-old... is the invention when we're 30. Sudarat! What will you do? Mom. I can't really destroy... my own invention. -Yeah! -Yeah! Hey, the rocket worked! Grandpa once told me, "Life doesn't begin at a certain age. It begins whenever you realize it." I never really got it but now I think I kinda get it. Why are you so late? I was browsing the library shelves. I don't know what to read. What are you reading, by the way? Sit down. The book says that, during the first three months, the baby's weight will increase 700-800 grams on average per month. It could be more or less than that. And, during the second trimester, it increases 500-600 grams per month. The older it grows, the less the weight increase. The baby's growth may slow due to teeth development. There may be decrease in appetite. Hey, Pratya won the Science Project award? I think our nation is doomed. Why are they so crazy about Top? I wanna see what he looks like. They're going crazy for Pratya who looks like that? Should we try staring at spoons like him? Subtitle translation by: Sirikarn K. Dubacher
