Hurry up! It's about to start! And you want not to flunk your grade, eh? Don't let them escape, I'll go see if more of them come. - He's going to flunk. - Right... that's why I can't allow him to do that. I promise... Two months ago you said you'd make him study. I have to go to Mexico every week. You're not from here. You have no more family here. I learned that by heart. - Make him work, instead. - I can't. I promised his late mother... that he'd be a nuclear physicist. Then he must study by mail. Yes? Let him take classes again. Please, miss. Okay. Make sure he comes back tomorrow. But this is his last chance, Mr. Lozano. - How did it go? - Pretty bad. My dad scolded me. He hit me. And I will take classes again. That's good. Not that good. I don't want to study. I want to work in a car shop. I'll put up with it. I want my dad to take me to Mexico. Are you going there again? If we go to Mexico together one day... will you go with me to the roller coaster? I don't know... But I'll go to the subway. One day in the subway, I saw a pickpocket stealing a girl. He opened her bag to take her wallet... and then a lady saw him. And then? Nothing, the guy pretended he was doing nothing... and he descended in the next stop. But his sidekick stayed. They always come in two. La Macarena? No one can go fetch him. - And then? - Nothing. The guy rubbed the lady's face... and no one defended her or tried to get the guy. They rob you in the streets and kill you on broad light. Give me one peso shaving blade. - I don't have. - You do. There they are. I won't open up a pack to sell only one blade. Your mother does. Is it true they rob kids to make tamales? That's nothing. Gonzalo said a cousin of his... met a man who found a finger with its nail... in a taco! One day I saw a bank robbery. I was in a bus when we heard the bullets flying. Everybody went down, but I peeped through the window... that the robbers went in their car and fled. Didn't they catch them? Let me tell you. An earthquake started, the walls fell... and the earth opened. And the robbers? A post fell down on them and it electrocuted them. - It's like in a movie. - And the floods! You have to go. Give me some Marlboro, please. Why don't you come with us? I'll tell my dad. - Will he accept? - Maybe. Ask your mom for permission. Mom, will you let me go with Jorge? He'll go vacationing to Mexico and invited me. - What about me? - What about you? - He didn't invite me? - No can do. We're going in his dad's truck... and you're going to go to my uncle's ranch. Alone? Yes, alone. Mom, will you let me? No, you'll go to the ranch. Your uncle is waiting for you. I'm bored of going to the ranch. I want to know Mexico. What did the Bimbo collector tells you? When will he come to collect? The day after tomorrow. Will you let me go? Will you, mommy? - Whose place will you stay? - I don't know. Carmelita, what happened? - It was Aaron, mom. It was him. - What did I do? He made me stumble. But Aaron was here, with me. He did a magic trick. He did a magic trick. It's okay, it's okay. Come on! Come here. Help me count. Here. If I hadn't been your mom... would you have loved me anyway? I would, mommy. But we wouldn't know you. It doesn't matter. I would have loved you anyway. Then what, mommy? Will you let me go? It's only for a week. Don't let him, mom. Jorge is a bad influence. He was expelled for playing hooky! That's not true, mom. It's true. Tencha, Mr. Ciro's daughter, told me. And you were punished because of him. - It's not true. - Aaron, what is this? Stop it! No Mexico! You two are going to the ranch, period. Later on, when I'm able to, I'll take you to Mexico. What's up? Didn't they let you go? So bad. My dad didn't want either. Don't worry. I'll start working, I'll gather some money... and I'll take you. I promise. Children, if you won't buy, don't touch that! Give me the magazine. You are a nightmare. - Seen Jorge Lozano? - Wasn't he expelled? No. - Jorge? - What? - I have an idea. - Wait until I get out! Jorge? What? - Can you hear me? - Yes. What if I go to Mexico in the truck... hidden among the load? - Jorge, you hear me? - Yes! And then? Once I'm in Mexico, your dad can't send me back. And your mom? We'll send her a telegram telling her I'm okay. Stop chatting. You seem a couple! You envious! - So? - It sounds good to me. The capital vices are seven. The first one? - Arrogance. - The second one? - Greed. - The third one? Lust. - The fourth? - Envy. - The fifth? - Gluttony. - The sixth? - We leave tomorrow. - The seventh? - At 4 in the afternoon. - Sharp. The earlier, the better. - Okay. There are seven virtues. The following. Against arrogance? Humbleness. - Against greediness? - Generosity. - Against lust? - Chastity. - Against wrath? - Patience. Mr. Pablo, take care of my furniture. Don't you scratch my bed. And don't break the mirror of the bedroom... because I apply my fake eyelashes in front of it. - Here. That's enough, right? - No. Some more. More. Ten... I was kicked out. I thought it was a dream... but it's repeated itself many times. Mother Gema says it was the appearances of the Virgin. What do you think? Hasn't it happened to you? It's so nice... You think I should be a nun? You know, Aaron? If I get to be a nun, you can ask me for many miracles. Why such a hurry? Where do you go? - What are you carrying? - What? Nothing. It's a delivery. Aaron, you're running from home! If you take me with you, I promise I won't tell. Aaron, you'll see! I'll accuse you with mom! Hurry! Dad, I found the lock! It was inside! Lock the door, son! It's just dawning and he's already... finding someone to bribe. Miss! I think they have no load. They're only two. It will be easy. The kid may get in the way. Orlando... do you know how to use that shit? - Of course. - Are you sure? Stop fooling around. Come on. Let's go. I told you. They're insatiable. But you won't get anything. Everything's in order. Take the papers out, Jorgito. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - What did we do? - The driver must descend. Give me your circulation card and your license. Here. Well, but... what did we do? In the back. Easy and nothing will happen to you. Easy, asshole! Virgilio, take them. Have him drive. Follow us. Rosendo! Rosendo! What's wrong with you? Leave him alone! Fuck! Go with them. You hide him. Hurry up! They will catch us! - I didn't mean... - Hurry, fuck! - The lock is open. - Close it. No, Rosendo kept the key. Take it off. Hurry! - Charge it aiming down. - What's up, young man? There is a change. Virgilio will drive the truck. - We have to talk about it. - Talk my ass. What about them? It's not convenient to leave them. We must leave the old man tied and gagged. - And the kid? - We take him with us. Sure. His company makes us unsuspicious. - And the traps? - Downstairs. Look out! There are a lot of people. - It's holidays! - That's true. That's cool! Yesterday and today... they must have earned much money. We have to kill time. What if we go to the Horror House? Or the Crazy Mouse. Didn't you see what way went a big truck... driven by a fat man and a kid? That way. The boy that rented apartment 4 was driving it. Jorge! Jorge, it's me, Aaron. Are you there, Jorge? - Let's go to the Love Plane! - No, it's time. Let's go. - Damn. - Come on! Don't do anything, or we'll get even with your dad. Be clever. Don't move. Come on! Go! Move, move. Hurry. - No! - Don't move or I'll shoot! Shut up. Get down. Turn around. Turn around, come on! You, you. Turn around. Tie her up. Tie her up! Hurry! - Help! Thieves! - Shut up! Hold on. The money is not ours. Let the run. - It's much money. - It's nothing. Help! Help! Stop. Here I come! - They went that way. - They were 2 men and a dwarf! Why did you shoot, damn? Go now! Don't try to help us! Save yourself! Hide! Don't let them see you! Jorge! Come here! - I'll wait for Aquiles. - Okay. Jorge! Pretend you don't know me. Run away! He must have given us away with a neighbor. Damn! And pacific Adolfo shot a cop. We have to hand the dough out! Hold on, damn it! There is no time. The police may come. What shall we do with them? You think they will kill us, dad? No. They'd have done it by now. - Did they steal much money? - A lot! They may give us something. After all, you helped them, right? Aaron's poor mother must be worried sick. But how could you do something like that? If something happens to him, you're to blame. Tell me, does he have a relative in here? Go figure. What will he do on his own... without money, in such a big city? What's up? - We will never make it. - Why don't you drive? It's not that easy. It's not an automatic car. - Don't get angry. - Why don't we dump the truck? As you wish. I don't mind. It's not mine. What do you think? Shall we dump the truck? Okay. We don't need it. But go ask the old man. Hey, is the truck yours? So? Dump it! - Here? - No, hide it in the woods! Well hidden. We'll wait for you here. Come on, let's check it out. Come on. It's fishy that they sent us hide the truck. - Why's that? - They may run with the money. - The lesser, the merrier. - You think? I don't know. It's a hunch. I wish that I'm wrong. You see? You're suspicious. Always... in case of damn doubt... I insist we share the money. Otherwise, it may go wrong. Jorge? Mr. Pablo? Damn! Why don't we go back to find the road again? No, we'll waste a lot of time! All of you go off and put twigs and stones. Come on! Let's everybody go off! Help or we will never make it. Let's go. My clothes! The luggage is in the trunk! The money! We have to take the money out! Dad! Dad! He's dead. Rolando! Stand back! Stand back! That shit is going to explode! Stand back, Roland! Fucking Rolando! I told you to share the money! - You jinxed it. - Don't blame it on me. It's not the first time it goes wrong being you here. You need a cleansing! I'll clean your ass, you son of a bitch! You moron! Get off me! St. Antonio, help me get out of here... and I promise I'll give you 20 brand new pesos. It has the lock. Who has the keys? No keys. Why did you put it, then? Who locked it? - It was me. - Of course. Who else? - What the fuck do you care? - What the fuck do I care? - What the fuck do I care? - Fucking stop it! We have enough problems! Hey, the car's engine is on. - No way. - Yes! - It may be Aaron. - Aaron? - What Aaron? - A friend. He traveled hidden in there. When we put the car in, there was no one. He's dead! No. I think we arrived on time. What shall we do now? Let's wait until the clean air detoxifies him. This is what I call luck, damn it! No loot and being nannies. Help me, help me! I have been robbed! You thieves! Help me, help me! I have been robbed! You damn thieves! Get them, get them! You thieves! Give me a note. - Isn't she coming? - What if we take off? Here? Don't be foolish. They'd find us to kill us. They are very clever. What's up? What's up? - Here they come! - Let's go. Come on. - And the cigarettes? - We didn't bring any. Why so many Twinkies? - Aquiles asked for them. - Come on! Snoopies don't count. Aquiles, your turn. Two pairs. Damn! Look... Kiddie, come here. Come here. Who's in here? - It's Rolando! - Let me see. Look. In here, too. - He's an artist. - Yes. - Has he filmed movies? - No, but he's going to. And I'll be his manager. - Someday. - And what do you do? Me? I'm a dancer. Don't believe me? Your turn, kiddie. No, I can't swim. Why? Come on! Soak him! Wait up! Mom... Aaron... Drink this. What is it? Aaron is ill. What is it? I don't know. I gave him 2 aspirins. We'll see. Kiddie. Kiddie! Help me out. To the room. Shall we have breakfast? - I'm going to Mexico. - To Mexico? What for? We need money. We can't just sit in here. Let's go get the water. Come on. They may recognize the car. No, I'll exchange it for another car on the way there. And I'll take Aaron to a doctor. No, wait. I came to pay you. I didn't have money the other day. It's a 500 peso note. You have change? And the rest? We'll go to my mom's house. She knows nothing about the robberies. She thinks I live in the US. Don't you tell her anything. You hear me? Guess who arrived last night! Excuse me? - Aquiles arrived last night. - Is he there? No, he went to run some errands... but he'll come back around 4. He asked me to invite you over. - Can you come? - It'll be a pleasure. What are you doing there? You'll catch pneumonia! Go to bed! How long have you been living here? 6 months. Aren't you scared of living alone? No, your mom and I make ourselves company. Sometimes we make jokes. One day we wanted to get you a female partner... and sent your photo to "Confidential". - Is that true? - She didn't send it. She kept it. Ma'am, you'll embarrass me. Why? That is the truth. Thank you. Is that ugly photo you have in your room? She took a copy, and it cost 100 pesos. For 100 pesos, you can have the flesh and bone original. - Take his word. - I have no money. I'll lend you. And... what do you do, miss? Don't be so formal. What do you do, Anita? I'm a 6th grade teacher. You heard, Aaron? She's a teacher. Would you like to study with her? Yes, but to fail 10 years in a row and marry her. You heard that, Aquiles? If you are too slow, that kid will take her away. You're tired. Yes, I didn't sleep well. With the fever, that kid moved like a dancer... and since my bed is so little... I would offer you my apartment... but I only have one bed. You can only share it if you're married. For the night, I'll give you my bed. You won't believe it, Ana Rosa... but this glass' been broken for 5 years. - I'll change it tomorrow. - You always say that. - Well, I'm off. - Don't you go. Stay. Why don't we go to the movies? Yes, your mom wants to go. Okay. Go groom yourself, mommy. No. You go. I'll stay and take care of Aaron. Did you want to go? You were feverish this morning. I'll go get my glasses. I'll be back. Aquiles will think I'm easy to get... but I haven't seen a movie in years. Why you leave him outside? They may steal it. Thief who robs a thief... You think that I stole it? Good night, Odysseus. No... it's Aquiles. Thank you. The deal was 100 pesos for the flesh and bone original. Hurry up! Eat something. I'll fix something in 15 minutes. We'll eat on our way. I'm in a hurry. Aquiles, you didn't change the broken glass. I didn't have time to buy it. I'll do it later. What's up? You arrived on that Maverick? The others? Francisco will come by walking. Adolfo, Rolando and Virgilio are off. Off? - When? - After you left. They had a fight with Francisco. They say they were to bullfighting... I don't care, - Are you okay now? - He's planning something. - They others took off. - Better for us! They spoil everything. I have a good idea for a kicking ass robbery. We'll going to Rey. Hand me the postcards. What are you looking at, fucking stoolie? Out! I see. No one watches there. There is a lot of money. Your mom lives over there. Another beer, please. - It's the last one. - Yes. Ma'am, give him real spicy sauce. How can we reach Gallo? I still don't understand why we need him. I don't really trust him. We need pictures of the quarters. They must not see us over there. I can take pictures. He must take them. - What am I going to do? - You? You'll be my particular secretary. What does a secretary do? Well... He answers the phone. He writes messages down, and whatnot. Who is it? Francisco. - May I speak with Aquiles? - Let me check. Who's taking his role more seriously? Aquiles or Aaron? Come on in. Thank you. See you. Do you want to go downtown? I'll take the subway to Chapultepec. Let's go. I'd like, but I can't. Aquiles needs me. "Aquiles needs me." We're going to go shopping. Okay. It's your lose. I wanted to know if we would fix something. - Your eye drops? - Aaron applied them to me. I pretended. I told him nothing of the bullets. I did good, didn't I? - I'll go with Arturo. - Okay. And get the cassocks, too. Aaron! Hide the plan and the postcards! The cleaner may see those. Is it true you were in jail? Yes. - It must be pretty bad. - Not that much. - I was there with Aquiles. - Aquiles was there, too? We were in the same cell. We had a blast. - Do you have siblings? - I don't. - But Aaron is your relative. - I'd rather be a dog! Well, we're friends. Leave 3S soon 3S you can. I mean it. The sooner, the better. Aquiles is very possessive. What do you think of the Villa robbery? It'll be cool. Who knows. It's a sacrilege. It's dangerous. What if someone calls the police over us? We would be back to jail. Aquiles wants to invite you over to watch a movie... on the color TV. Did he buy a TV? No. We stole it. What about the shirt? Is it stolen also? Damn! You sat on my cake! Have some. Aaron, leave that alone! You'd better go to sleep! We have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Don't boss around! Don't! Stop bitching around, damn! Stop bitching around, fuck! Forgive me, Jorge. I hate we fighting each other. Not my face! You see why I don't like that you drink? Okay. I'm off. Good night. Easy, man. It's okay. You have to be okay for tomorrow. Don't you want us to go on with the plan? Hello? Police station? Who I can tell there will be a robbery? Who I can tell about a robbery? They will steal the Guadalupe Basilica's alms. Hello? Hello? - Who's that? - Me. - I was sent to sleep with you. - Aren't you the pet? Aquiles wants to take care of Francisco. Do you want silver pesos? I need to gather 13. I promise them to St. Antonio if the robbery goes well. How dare you ask a saint for a robbery to go well? - That's a mortal sin. - Aquiles says it's not a sin. It's not a sin. It's something more. It's sacrilege. "My mother unlocked it and opened the chest." In the top part you could see nothing... but a suit of very fine making. Under the suit there were many tobacco rolls... a beautiful couple of guns, a silver bar... "a beautiful Spanish clock and some..." Do you want your drops? And some other cheap stuff. A pair of compasses and 5 or 6 rare shells... from the West Indies. We also found an old cloak, worn out by the time. My mom patiently took them out... and we found the last thing. The same that robbed Chapultepec. 5 p.m. We're safe! The Pope can't forgive an excommunicated. We'd go straight to hell! But Aquiles has been very good to us. Not to me. Did you forget they killed my dad? We should go to the Villa. It will be exciting! - Aquiles told me not to go. - He won't see us! Shall we? Let's go. This way. Look! We can see everything from there. - Don't you see them? - No. They are disguised as priests. You didn't tell me that. Where you go? - Who's that? - A secret agent. How do you know? Uf! I told them they are dressed as priests. Why? So that it gets more exciting. Where you go? I'll tell Aquiles. I won't let them get him. Aaron, you're crazy! Come here! - Humberto... Humberto... - What's wrong? I saw them. - One has an injured lip. - Are they two? - Come on. - He saw them. No, Lopez. There are a lot of people. They didn't see us. Let's follow them. They may be more. Go check on Pedro at the office. See you. That way. Please, St. Antonio, let Aquiles unharmed. I promise you these 13 silver coins. You stupid kid! Don't you see where you're going? Let's stop here. Wait up! Aquiles... I tipped them. They'll get us. You remember... the blast that we had in prison? If you die... what shall I do in jail on my own? Or outside? Freeze! Come on! Follow the other one! - The priest would be robbed! - You're the sidekick! Sidekick! I was going to see the Virgin! Virgin my ass! Aaron! Aaron! Dear Lord, dear Lord... please don't let them harm Aquiles. What was it? What happened? They say that they killed a priest... three blocks from here. May God have him in His Glory. What can we expect? They don't even respect a priest. Look, mom! They are here! Here they come! You think the boys know about my furniture? Hooray, JOTQE! Hooray, JOTQE! Come, kids. Hey, don't be sad. I promise you something, because we're buddies. I won't tell anyone you were on the thieves' side. He's not here. Aaron, son! Aaron! Aaron! Sun!
