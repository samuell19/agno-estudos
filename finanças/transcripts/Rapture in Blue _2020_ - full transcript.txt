(telephone ringing distantly) (ringing continues, builds) Tell me, God, it isn't true... flames so hot that they turn... blue. (burner humming) VALERIE: I thought you said this place was empty. JASON: Shh. (tea kettle whistling) (whispering) Jason, let's get the hell out of here. (door opens) (humming gleefully) (gasps) (glass shattering) (train horn blares distantly) Who are you? I could ask you the same thing. What are you doing in my house? Your house? My name is Jason Aylwood. I used to live here. Sebastian Brown. I just moved in. VALERIE: We were just seeing if the key still works. It does! Come on, baby. Let's go. VALERIE: Jason. Take me someplace else. Please. Jason. Aren't you forgetting something? JASON: Come on, let's go. VALERIE: What the hell was that? Cuties. (owl hooting) VALERIE: Sebastian Brown. What a fucking creep. (moody rock music playing on car stereo) Didn't your mother ever teach you not to talk to strangers? Val, I... I think we're the strangers. Hello, stranger. (car passing by) Where are we gonna go now? I wanna go all the way. Here? (giggling) No, not here. (cellphone ringing) JASON: Sorry, it's my dad. Just let it ring. Val, wait! No! Oh, God. VALERIE: Not there, either. Someplace just for us. I was gonna wait to tell you, but... turns out I have the house all to myself tomorrow. Now... you're more than welcome to stop by. But... in order to do that... Jason, look at me. First, I'm gonna need to hear how much you love me. Hey. Valerie Monroe... I love you. Prove it. (music continues) (car passing by) I want it to be perfect, Jay. I want you to be my first. Will you be my first? Each other's first? (wind howling, footsteps) (footsteps) What was that? What was what? (footsteps) Fuck. Shit. (music stops) VALERIE: Baby, stay in the car. Jason, come on. Let's just go home. Jason, who's out there? Why... why don't I take you out tomorrow? And then later, we can... go back to your place and have the most perfect night of our lives. Oh, Jason... Jason, you do love me! (knocking) Uh, hello... again. Um, I-I was taking her home, and I-I... I realized that I left my... um. (dog barking) (gothic rock music playing inside) I'm just fucking with you. Uh... I wanted to apologize about earlier. This place has been empty for so long, and we didn't have anywhere else to go. It's not so much that you snuck in with your girlfriend. Only that, uh... we just got here, and well... we only have so many mugs. Is anyone home? (music continues) JASON: It's so strange. (train horn blares distantly) Strange like how? Well, strange like... I've been here before, because I have. But still, I... I haven't. We have the same room. JASON: The last night I-I slept here when I was... eight or nine... my parents and I had come home really late from... somewhere. I can't remember. They... they told me to go right to bed, so I hurried in, but... there was something... wrong. The air was so... different... heavy and wet. (electricity pulsing) And then I looked down... and I realized that I was stepping on... broken pieces of glass. Someone had punched in the back window and let themselves in. And on the floor... was a single trail of blood leading inside. So I followed it... deeper and deeper... until it disappeared underneath the closet door. (hinge creaking) Who was in there? No one. (loud knocking) (knocking continues) I don't want to be here anymore. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. Are you sure you don't wanna stay here? You can spend the night. I don't care. (sirens blaring distantly) All right. Well, at least let me write down my number. You don't think I'd have my own number memorized by now? This is my house! No, it's not. I shouldn't have come here. There's a last time for everything... just as there is... the opposite way around. There's something black in your soul. And if you're not careful, it's gonna devour you. (dog barking) Let's hope you're right. (thunder rumbles distantly) (cellphone ringing) I'm ready when you are, Jay. (Ariana Kelly's "Wine (A Sea Of Future)" plays) Living in darkness proved I'd Never say the words I prayed as the First time I laid eyes on you Laid my eyes on You chained your fate since the dates when I Pictured us to be in love in light Despite all my dreams of you Drowned in time All I want Is all I need You take from me A sea of future ahead of us A future ahead of us I'll be right back. Heat from the fire grows higher, it's Telling me to face the flames and burn 'Cause everything I knew as true Split in two 'Cause all I want Is all I need And now I bleed A sea of future ahead of us A future Turn me blue Come back to you Escape my name, oh... (music fades) Hey. Hey! (people murmur indistinctly) Deep, dark blue... (gasping, panting) Jason, where are you going? (wind howling, paper rustling) (thunder crashes) (electronic music playing in club) (sirens blaring) Ugh, cool off. Kiss me. No. Kiss me, Valerie. I can handle it. Look at me. Jason, where are you? Why aren't you here right now? This was supposed to be... (sighs) Yeah. (wind howling) JASON: Listen. Somebody followed me to Sebastian's last night. After you dropped me off, you went back? I left my jacket. I had to go back. But, listen. There's a picture... an impossible picture from someplace else. Somebody was watching me... and I think they followed me here, too. Prove it. I can't. I don't have it with me. (sighs) It's not you, it's me. VALERIE: Can you just take me home? Please. (sirens blaring, wind howling) (telephone ringing) JASON'S FATHER (on machine): You've reached the Aylwood residence. Please leave a message. (beep) JASON'S FATHER (on speaker): Jason, I'm gonna take that goddamn cellular phone away from you if you continue to ignore my calls! (sighs) Now, your mother and I are flying back first thing tomorrow morning, and we're gonna need to have a talk with you. Per our agreement, I hope to God that you've not brought that white-trash girl or your low-life friends into the home. And son, I really hope you haven't been smoking cigarettes inside again. (static feedback) We're gonna have to figure out what to do about this situation. (glass screeching quietly) This is not the way any of us planned things to be going, son. (metal clattering) We'll talk tomorrow. (hangs up reciever) (thunder crashes) JASON: Where are we gonna go now? VALERIE: I wanna go all the way. JASON: Here? VALERIE: No, not here. JASON: Valerie Monroe... I love you. (dark synth music playing) VALERIE: Prove it. (thunder crashes) WOMAN (singing): Deep, dark blue. SEBASTIAN (whispering): Jason. (electricity pulsing) WOMAN (singing): Turn me blue. VALERIE: I want it to be perfect, Jay. SEBASTIAN: There's a last time for everything... VALERIE: I want you to be my first. SEBASTIAN: ...just as there is... VALERIE: Will you be my first? SEBASTIAN: ...the opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. VALERIE: Each other's first. SEBASTIAN: The opposite way around. (thunder crashes) (embers sizzling) (cellphone ringing distantly) (owl hooting, distorted) (wind howling) MAN'S VOICE: I am already realized. Just down the corridor. Meandering upon the threshold. The brink of implosion. Tilting. Tilting within division. It is not you. It is me. Feel my touch. Hear my sound. Send for me. Come for me. VALERIE (distorted): Jason, who's out there? (thunder crashes) (gasping, panting) (door slams shut) (quick, heavy footsteps) (glass shattering) (thunder crashes) Sebastian? Sebastian! (gasping, panting) (train horn blares distantly) Shit. SEBASTIAN: Back so soon? (thunder crashes) (sobbing) He found me! He knows where I live! He came inside my house! Who? Who did? (whimpering) There's something wrong with my brain. Tilting... tilting. You're here now... and you're not going anywhere. This is our house... and we never have to leave. Stay here with me. Forever. You wanna kiss me, don't you? Just like you did the other night? It's okay. It's okay. (moaning, gasping) (thunder crashes) (ticking) (faucet running, stops) (electricity pulsing) (rhythmic knocking) (hinge creaking) (gasping) (loud knocking) (knocking continues) (thunder crashes) (knocking) VALERIE: Jason! (thunder crashes) Jason, I know you're in there. Jason! (glass cracking) Ah! Ah! Jason, open the door. JASON'S VOICE: And then I looked down, and I realized that I was stepping on broken pieces of glass. VALERIE: Jason, open this fucking door! Jason! (voices echo loudly) (voices stop abruptly) (glass cracking) You still want me, huh? You want it from me, don't you? You wanna take it from me? I don't know what you're talking about. Do you know what you're talking about? Baby? Baby! Proof, Jason. Proof! (thunder crashes) (camera flashes) Val, how did you... where... Are you out of your fucking mind? This was supposed to be our night! But it's too late! You fucked it all the way, you cocksucker! You shouldn't be here. You need to leave, now. Do you see yourself in these pictures, Jason? Is that you? Is that what you look like? It's not what it looks like! It is, Jason. It is. It's you! Get out of my fucking house! What the fuck? VALERIE: Jason, come back. Jason. (knocking) Jason! I love you! Jason! (crying) Jason! Jason! Jason! (groans) Jason! (crying) (distorted screaming) No! (wind howling) (electricity surges, glass shattering) (hinge creaking) (gasping) (screaming) (door opens) (telephone ringing) (glass shattering) JASON'S FATHER (on machine): You've reach the Aylwood residence. Please leave a message. (beep) JASON'S FATHER (on speaker): Jason... where are you? (train horn blares distantly) (thunder crashes) (screaming, reverberates) (Tamaryn's "Violet's In A Pool" plays) Filled up with noises From the dark depth Stark screaming curses On the card deck Now the knock Under foot Come in closer Do you wander while it's curling Round the corner?
