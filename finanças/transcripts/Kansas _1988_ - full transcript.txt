[EXHALES] You just riding, Wade, or you got some place to ride to? No, New York City. Best buddy's getting married, 23rd. Best man. That's important. Being a best man, being a buddy. Yeah. Car burned up outside of Orem, Utah. Lost all I had. Clothes, travellers' cheques, silver-plated tray. That tray was the wedding gift. Figured I'd drive cross-country. That was the plan, take an extra week. Cut through Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, drop down into Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, then around Lake Erie to Buffalo, head down the New York State freeway into Manhattan. Didn't work out. Nice juicy orange, Wade. You know, the place I come from's in Kansas. Nice little town, still got people who remember me there, still got friends. You come along with me, I guarantee somebody'll set you up. I appreciate the offer.Big holiday this time of year. Horseshit parade but afterwards you get all the home-cooked food and cold beer you can get your hands on. Anybody, or you got to be local? Anybody. You can eat yourself to death for all they care. Shit, I've been thinking about smoked ribs since I don't know when. Maybe you're right. Clean up my act a little bit. I know I'm right. Trust me. You been in New York before? New York's a first-impression town. DOYLE: There are only about three things to do here. Cars, drink beer, chase women. In the winter, you got basketball games. In the summer, you just try to stay cool. If you really get bored, go down river, climb the old steel bridge. Then what happens? Swing down on a rope like an ape. Scare the hell out of whatever's passing. Real small-town America, huh? Right on, Wade. I worked there in my junior year in high school. The guy who owns the drugstore, he and the old man played golf, guy by the name of Frank Harris. He got me a job as a soda jerk. What happened? Can your ass for petty theft? Sampling the merchandise. Caught me with my hand in the black beauty jar. Black beauties? It's a vitamin pill, Wade. Good source of calcium. Cute little bank, ain't it? Yeah. It's real cute. It's quaint. Hello, legionnaires! How you doing? You old sweetheart! Sam Frank.Sam, how you doin'? How you doin'? Hello, Governor. How are you? I knew this bank robber once, guy named Red, ex-marine from San Diego. The craziest son-of-a-bitch you wouldn't want to meet. He stuck up, like, 20 banks, all in the San Diego area. Wasn't the brightest ex-marine in the world, was he? How did they nail him? His old lady. They had a fight. She turned him in. She was sorry afterwards, real fucking sorry. Well, I hope he pulled his time. Gotta be crazy to do banks. Hey, Wade. You got that right. Red... When I knew Red, he was real straight. Nice guy. Real nice sense of humor. Yeah. He was popular... He was a good friend. [DOOR SLAMS] MAN: Come on! Come on! Let's go! WOMAN: All right, honey. C'mon, honey. We'll be late for the service. Let's go! KID: All right! [ENGINE STARTING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [ENGINE RATTLING] Sounds like he needs a transmission. That or rear axle. Let's go. You'll be late for breakfast. How do you like your eggs, Wade? Over-easy. [GLASS BREAKING] You like this shirt? I love it! Yeah? WOMAN ON TV: Leave those nightmares... [CHANGES CHANNEL] ...are not worth comparing to the glory that is to be revealed. Isaiah 12:2. When the power of his love is revealed unto you, then the power of God is so awesome indeed. It shall be revealed oh, so deep in your heart. He is the salvation. He is the salvation. He is the salvation. Hallelujah! Every churchgoer's got one vice. That's what my grandma used to say. I figured the bastard for a Methodist! Serves the guests lemonade, keeps the booze stashed in the pantry. Takes a few nips. He's the life of the party. Starts playing the piano! You're a clean-cut sort. Not by any chance you're a Methodist? Any preachers in your background? No. My mother's a Catholic. Guess that makes me the same. Yeah, well... That's the way it goes with religion. Stick it on you at birth. Pious bastards got to preach to somebody. Never took. What's that? A tip? We had $20 worth of food. Not to mention this sharp shirt. Piss on it! [MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYING] Hi! [CAMERA CLICKING] [BABY GIGGLING] Put the mike on them... Hey, old buddy. You got the time?10.30. Okay, keep going on. Big day. [ALL APPLAUDING] They tell me you're having tough times, right? How d'you figure that out, Governor! [ALL CHEERING] GOVERNOR: US farmers make up one-tenth of one per cent of the world's population but produce about 25 per cent of the world's food... I got the same damned shirt. Same darned thing. Tell me. Is that short sleeve or long? Looks like short. Is yours short too? Mine's short as well. I was told mine was a one-of-a-kind, a limited edition. Where d'you buy yours? Hersheimer's in Topeka. I'd say, late March. Been there, but I'll be damned if I remember buying it in Hersheimer's. Will you just check the label for me? Ha! Hersheimer's! That's not the first time a salesman's lied to me. I'm sure it's not the last.Oh. I like your taste in liquor, too. I grew up on a farm. I remember the taste of lemonade after a long day of harvesting. Excuse me, Governor. She's had a little too much sun. She'll be fine. You got a slight case of sunstroke, honey. We'll be sending you back. GOVERNOR: My folks, just like you, are the poor of the breadbasket of America. The food in the markets... We're gonna take you home. Take her back, will you? GOVERNOR: ...agricultural businessmen and women. [ALL APPLAUDING] An old girlfriend, a very cute blonde, works here last I heard. She married the bank loan officer two years ago. She still screws anybody who asks. I think he finally got a divorce. Maybe she's got a girlfriend.Hey, you never know. WADE: Jesus Christ! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Shut up. Tell me what you wanna do, Wade. I got no time for bullshit. [COCKS TRIGGER] Are you with me or not? With you! Get in the vault. Fill your bag. [EXHALING] Get in it! Now! [GASPS] DOYLE: Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt you. Stay right there, sweetheart. You stay right there. You hear me? I ain't gonna hurt you. Take it easy. [WHIMPERS] Take it easy. I ain't gonna hurt you. There. Just relax. [TREMBLING] Oh, Jesus. DOYLE: No need for hysterics. Jeez, you made a little mess there. Why don't you sit down? Take it easy. I'm gonna tape up your ankles, all right? Come on, baby. Grow up. Holy shit! [MUFFLED CRIES] Oh, shit! Let's go. Okay. All right. Take that off, man. Let's go. If we get split up, meet me at the Hotel Fredrick in Sedosta tomorrow. Understand? I ain't goin' to Sedosta. Wherever the fuck that is. I never saw you. You never saw me. Wait a minute. Listen. You got a one-third share. You want it? If you don't, that's your problem. I'm tryin' to help. [WOMAN SOBS] [ALARM RINGING] That's the bank. [SIRENS WAILING] [SIREN APPROACHES] [CROWD SHOUTING] MAN: You! Shit! Damn! [PANTING] This is 44, Grace. WOMAN ON RADIO: Lone male suspect reported near Valley Falls cemetery south of Linwood Bridge. I'm on it, Grace. Ten four. Hey! Watch out! [TIRES SQUEALING] Just leaving, south of the cemetery.

REPORTER: Go in close on the child... I saw it when he was taping me up. I saw quite clearly. It wasn't a birthmark or anything. It was a tattoo. It looked like a panther. Can you remember which forearm? Mmm. If I had to guess... I'd say the left. But only if I had to. The rest of it... He brushed my body, once or twice. I'm not sure the lifting up the dress was deliberate. He did call me sweetheart. Now, it was close, see? I'd just about cleared my holster when he knocked me to the floor. I didn't have time for chitchat. He laid that piece across my skull faster than... Thank you, Mr. Hudkins.He's a professional, I know that. I hope he comes back. Tell the newspapers Roy Hudkins extends a special invitation. We'll do that, Roy. That's Roy V Hudkins. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Be quiet! I got some information, if you'll just be quiet. Damn it! Got a description here. Lone white male perpetrator. Approximately six feet. Medium build. Dark hair. Dark eyes... Anything else... He has a weapon! He's got a .357 revolver. Apparently belonged to the bank guard. Now, boys, that's it. Please. Keep 'em away from us, will you? We don't know who he is, or where he's from. Maybe we'll never know but there's no questioning his courage. His heroism's there, captured by Nelson's camera, for all the world to see. Oh, man! Charlie, this rescue thing's gonna mushroom nationally. Well, let's post a reward, find the guy. Give him a medal. [LAUGHS] Let the governor throw his arms around him for TV. Shit! That's our job, isn't it? WOMAN ON TV: Did you see the child in the car? This is big, Charlie. There's enough heroism here for everybody. Let's not get politically stupid, kick a miracle in the ass. Right. [GRUNTING] Morning! You stealing it or just feeling the upholstery? I guess I'm just kind of admiring it. On private property. Can't you read trespass signs? Hold it right there.

I pay you $4 an hour, three meals a day and a bunk during harvest. You can count on eight, nine days. Then I drop back to my regulars, you go on to other places. That's good. You look like you can use it. Here's 50 in advance. No, thanks, sir. When you pay the rest is fine. In the meantime... Keep your hands off my truck. Junior, you positive you didn't see some guy hanging round here? He's got blondish colored hair, about, say, about this big. Bit of a yahoo? I already told you. I haven't seen anyone and if anyone comes in here, I seen 'em. All right.Thanks. Is that your paper? No. Can I look at it? Yeah. All right. Thanks a lot, junior. It's Okay. MAN: That's Doyle.

Kid just graduated college.Yeah? Kenny, my oldest. I love that God-damned kid. I bet you do, sarge. Ma'am? Get this defender of liberty a drink on me. BARTENDER: Comin' up! What's the young man gonna do now? Now that he's matriculated, got his fist wrapped round that diploma? Space shuttle, maybe? Farming. Work the land. That's all he ever wanted to do. Well, you'd better fill him in. You don't work it, it works you. Ask my old man, he'll tell you. You ever done any farming? Hell, I kicked the dirt off my boots a long time ago. Don't care for it much underneath my fingernails either. I get my food off the supermarket shelf, same as you. Here's to Kenny. To Kenny. Ah! MAN ON RADIO: Showers moving into the area. The high near 67. Outlook for Sunday, a good chance for rain. High temperature near 60. I know who you are. I'd rather my wife didn't hear this. If you, uh... If you gentlemen think he's here, you're mistaken. Only contact we've had's been prison notices. You, uh... You figure he's the one that robbed that bank. Yeah, I never knew who he ran with. Mean kids, like himself. Never reachable. I guess we'd... We'd all feel a lot better if we thought he didn't do it. Didn't do, uh... A lot of the things he's done. Oh! Kenny. Kenny? If he was any kinda kid at all, he'd come and get you. It's June now. I think Father's Day's coming up. Gonna put you to bed now, sarge. Teddy! LORI: Oh, yes! [GIGGLES] Come on, honey. Do it again! Here we go. Another beer, Wade? Thanks. LORI: I'm not even breaking a sweat yet, honey. Takes the game seriously. You ever played tennis, Wade? Swing the ol' racket, so to speak? A couple of times. Family never had the bread for a country club. Mine neither. Couldn't afford the dues or the white pants. LORI: I got it! BUCKSHOT: Boyfriend's name's Ted. He belongs to the country club. Yeah. He can afford the dues. WADE: I like the way Ted ties his sweater around his neck! Fucker never breaks a sweat. Probably owns a speedboat, too. You know, she beats his ass regularly! Yeah! Yeah! Hates to lose. I figured the other day, she's won maybe 20 games, 6-9, scores like that. Doesn't seem to bother him at all. So, that little kid, the governor's little girl, is she okay? Hmm. According to the newscasters, the woman on Channel 13. Yeah. She's okay.Good. Ted, a little too far left. Ooh! But you know, it's that bank robber I'd be worried about. I hope his butt is south. I thought it was two guys. One. I hope he's south, for his sake. I got a feeling that they are going to kill him, prop him up on the door, cross his arms across his chest and take pictures of him, like they used to in the old days! Well, don't drink too much of this beer now, Wade. The sun's a pisser when you got a headache. I'll see ya later, Buckshot. LORI: Yes! Yeah! It's okay, Teddy. It's just fine, honey! Really! Remember the moment, Nelson. Thanks, Sid. [INDISTINCT ARGUING] [CLICKS] [CUTTING] MAN OVER RADIO: Will have a miracle testimonial from Timothy... [SIREN WAILING] My personal favorite, ask and you shall receive. Hallelujah! Sergeant Reese McCue, on my way to Leavenworth to pick up a prisoner. That doesn't make much sense, using a road like this, sergeant. Why is that? You want 156 north to Leavenworth, don't you? Son of a bitch! I knew I screwed up somewhere back there! Turn-off's 15 miles back.Damn lucky I ran into you. You mind if I see some registration? Your driver's license, sergeant? That's a bit of a problem. I'm driving a rented vehicle. Well, I can see that. Rental papers will be fine. My CO's gonna be pissed off about the ticket, but I'm not blaming you. There's no question I was speeding. A good 20 over the limit. Yeah, well... Body decorations offend you, officer? Uh, sometimes. Just a matter of taste. [STARTS ENGINE] [CAR APPROACHING] OFFICER: I knew something was wrong when I saw that panther on his arm. Hair kinda crept up the back of my neck. I said to myself, "Oh, Steve! Watch it now!" You never know what you got. You got lucky, that's what you got, trooper. Real lucky. I hope I see the good sergeant again. I'll just tell you what, he's running, and we'll try to chase him back your way, huh? You take care. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Little one-armed guy, Eddie, said you're looking for some help? You ever handled a thrill ride? Worked the devil's teacup at the Texas State Fair. Is that right? Right. I just fired a guy off the paratrooper. He walked off, left the joystick full throttle with women and children aboard. You gotta be kiddin' me? No, I'm not. It's a miracle no one sued. Someone did. I take my fair share of off-duty sips, but it's safety first as far as the public is concerned, particularly with children. Some kid starts horsing around, off he comes. I run a tight ride. 220 a week. I supply the meals. You supply the bed. Two out of three ain't bad.We'll be here for five days. Then we're going to Arkansas City. You're working with two other guys. You put 'em up, you tear 'em down, and you pack the trucks. Any chance for a cup of coffee? I don't believe I caught your name. Oh, I didn't throw it. It's Gaddis, Bob Gaddis. But my friends call me Bud. Hello, Bud. [CUPS CLINK] Sure would like to meet the man who invented air-conditioning. Like to give him a medal. [LAUGHS] Come in out of the heat, Wade! Cool off your brain! Who wants to go for a ride? Huh? Wanna go for a ride? Come on. You wanna drink? Where d'you get that horse? Anybody tell you that hands don't ride ranch stock? I'm just sitting on his back. He invited me along for the ride. People get violent over stuff like that. Horse theft's a major felony around here. I guess you're right. What difference does it make? Couple of days you'll get drunk, do something stupid and get fired. Must be nice having all the right answers. Happens every time.The old man's getting his $4 worth. That's why you're here with me. You get a kick out of that. You gonna tell him? Gonna tell him about that? If you're looking to create trouble for yourself you're doing a good job. A little bit crazy, you know that? Let's play tennis some time.You don't play tennis. I learned watching TV. Guys like you never play tennis. I could kick the ball over the net better than your boyfriend hits it. My boyfriend's gonna be a lawyer, gonna do something with his life. What are you gonna do with yours? Ow! [LAUGHS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [FAIRGROUND ORGAN PLAYS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [CHILDREN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Sorry, folks. No mothers-to-be. She's only five months. Trust me. Thrill rides and motherhood don't mix. I saw one such incident. Wasn't pretty. Take your word for it. I run a tight ride. I'll pick that one. Here we go. Give me one more. MAN: I'm ready to win. I'm not going home empty-handed. LORI: That's the one I'm gonna get. Look at this! Yeah! Okay! [GIRL EXCLAIMING] So, he sits his dog, a very large bastard, like a wolfhound or Great Dane, on the bar stool. MAN: So the bartender strolls over and says, "What do you want to drink?" And he says, "Two martinis, please." [LAUGHS] That's not funny. You didn't get it! You didn't get it! I got it. [CHILDREN SCREAMING] Looks to me like she's already got a boyfriend, Wade. [CHUCKLES] I've been wondering where you were. Oh, I bet you have. Every waking moment, maybe even in your dreams, too. Tell me. How does it feel to be half-criminal, half-hero? It's fucked up, how do you think? We pulled it off, you and me. Nobody can come between that. No... You understand what I'm saying, Wade? Nobody can change that. I see what you mean. I never had to say no to drugs. It's never been my problem. I get high doing the unthinkable. The moment I decided to rob that bank, I was high, so very high. [CHUCKLING] You know, your average guy couldn't understand that. Where's the money, Wade? It's down by the river. In a hole in a tree. What the fuck do you mean, a tree? There's got to be 100 trees there, maybe 1,000 trees. You can't tell trees apart. How are you going to do that? How are you gonna know it's the one? Made a mental map. Five trees south, four west of the old steel bridge. MAN: Hey, Wade! Come on! One second, okay. I'm working on a wheat spread 15 miles south. Who owns it? Guy named Bayles. B-A-Y-L-E-S. MAN: Hey, Wade. Come on! We gotta get back. Listen, why don't you just tell them you quit? You got something more important to do? Very smooth. I talk to a stranger. Next move I make, I quit. Think somebody might remember your face? All right, all right. Tomorrow's my last day anyway. Meet me under the bridge, 10 o'clock tomorrow night. 2200 hours. You got it.You got it. All right. Friends? Friends. All right. MAN: What did you get? [GIRL SCREAMING] [CHILDREN SCREAMING] Hey! Where is that bastard that runs this machine? MAN: I swear I'll kill this rat. [GROANS] I'm lucky Alvin heard those poor people screaming and came running when he did. I like that Al. He's a damn good man. I still can't believe it. I sneak around the tent to water my horse. Here's these two farm boys just lookin' at me. I had no idea. I swear, I had no idea there was a couple of home-grown roll artists. You're lucky they didn't queer ya. [CHUCKLING] You know! That's the first thing that came to my mind. Then, bam! One of them hit me on the side of my head with that pipe. Well, my mind's a total blank after that. Seventy five bucks. Everything I had. Used to be you felt free to walk around without your arms wrapped around your purse. Criminals pretty much stuck to larger cities. [SIGHS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER BREAKING] [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO] [RAINING HEAVILY] MAN ON RADIO: They'd like to know the hero's name before they dedicate their new auditorium to him...

WADE: You sure? Yeah. I don't know what you think, but up till now I've been pretty good. WADE: I never thought anything else. Sometimes, it just happens. Something gets started between two people, then they can't put it down. Sooner or later, it happens to everybody. Look, it was my fault. Hundred percent. Just couldn't control myself. Neither could I. I'm going to go to college this fall, the University of Kansas. I'm gonna join a sorority, go to football games, date different people. Normal stuff. Gonna find out about myself. So this didn't fit into your plan? Well, if it makes any difference, it meant something for me. What am I supposed to say? Nothing, all I'm saying is... I have to get inside. Stuff has happened I can't talk about. Sometimes things aren't the way they look. You want me to leave? Is that what you want? You've just gotta say so. No. Buckshot! Buddy, can you give me a lift into town? Button up your shirt, hot pants! We got crop damage. What time you got? 10:38 and 50 seconds. One... Two... Three... Four... Here we are. [RUSTLING] Oh, shit!

You're acting different this morning... Edgy. I didn't sleep much last night. Cathy called. She and Don are gonna join us for lunch. Hey! Good old Don! Yeah. [WHIRRING] Yeah. This is it, Bob. You sure you don't want me to run you up, Billy? Well, it's been about a year since I've seen her. Maybe I'd better take a little time instead of walking up on her cold. I'm proud to have met you, Billy. You got our phone number. Give us a call some time. Hey, Bob. Simple five! [LAUGHS] Take care, Bob. [TED AND LORI ARGUING] LORI: I don't want to talk about it. TED: That's gonna help a lot! Lori! Honey, we'll talk about it tomorrow. [CAR DRIVES AWAY] You listening or what? We talk a minute? Let's get something straight. We aren't goin' anywhere. This isn't last night. I know. Do you think I didn't know that? So, you and what's his name... Ted. Ted. What were you arguing about? What gives you the right? You happen to sleep with someone. You think that adds up to instant love? We were arguing cause he wanted to give me his fraternity pin. [LAUGHS] Sound stupid to you? Thought you were gonna play the field and date the whole university. Remember? I didn't say anything either way. That answer your question? You didn't want his pin because it doesn't mean anything to you. I can tell. It's like what you said. Sometimes, things just happen. [SIGHING] [CLICKING] Hey, old buddy. I wouldn't swallow if I were you. I slaughtered pigs when I was a kid. Kiss my ass, Doyle. You got some strange views on friendship. Kiss my ass, like it was me who didn't show up at the bridge. Where is it? You got it here? It's where I said it was. You think you're cute, but you're not. You're not even funny. You know, Wade. I thought this was America. You plan something, you take the risk, you collect the reward. So no shit about a third share. I get half. Understand? Half. Fucking with my livelihood! This is all I do. You, you got something else to fall back on. You get to play hero. Cut me. Then your share's down to zero. All right. Equal partners, down to the last dime. We're not partners, buddies, friends. Understand? Easily we forget, Wade! Wade, if it makes any difference, I had no intention of using this knife. [CHUCKLING] Sometimes you gotta show it to make a point. You got wheels? You have a brilliant mind for detail. What we gonna do, walk? Look, I'll take care of it tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be no problem. Call me the superstar in rent a car. There's a crossroads about two miles west. Grocery store, gas station, diner. Meet there tomorrow night, 9:00, with the car. Like the song says, I'll be there. It's you I worry about. I think you like being a farmer, having dirt underneath your fingernails. Right? Your record stinks when it comes to keeping appointments. Next time it happens, I might not be so tolerant. You're just worried about not getting your ass shot off. They get mine. They get yours. Ten to 20 in Leavenworth. That's part of the picture. Not to mention the FBI. That bank was FDIC. You know why I know you're gonna be there tomorrow night? You got no choice.What are you doin'? You got no place to hide. You're back on the run, boy. [HORSES WHINNYING] WADE: Come on.

Nobody's asking you to. [HUFFS] Oh! You know, things like this don't happen to me. So. Stay. Parts I remember and parts of it I just don't. Running away, I just don't remember. I guess my head was somewhere else. You know, you see things happen and you just react. I was there, so... That's about it. Hey, baby. You know what I was thinkin' about just now? Got no idea. Hawaii. Yeah, Hawaii. [GUN COCKS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SIGHING] Big day, Wade. Yeah, looks like it, don't it? Never seen so many cops. [LAUGHS] Fella on the phone says he's a personal friend. Wouldn't give his name. Said you'd know who he is. Great. Thanks.Yeah. Jer, is that you? This ain't Jerry, asshole. It's me. I'm the other good friend you fucked over. Number one on your list of problems is me. No more next times, no more maybes. No more, "Doyle, I'm sorry I fucked up." I got a .45 slug with your name on it next time you fuck up. We clear? Yeah. I'll be there. You'd better be there and it better be there, too. You'd better find that god damn tree you got mapped out in your head. Look, Wade, I'm just gettin' warmed up. I still got ideas. You don't show up tomorrow, there's no telling what I'll do. All right. Thanks a lot, buddy. You too. Great guy! WOMAN: Hey, Dan.MAN: Hey, Gloria. How you doin'? GLORIA: Long time, no see.DAN: Yeah. Been a while. Say, I hear you're leaving... GLORIA: Yeah. Oh, shit! How are your kids. Oh, they're fine. Good. DAN: Yeah, they're having a big birthday party next week. GLORIA: Oh, well, my life! DAN: Eddie's gonna be five. GLORIA: Be goin' to school next year... Oh, listen, I got to... DOYLE: Hey, sunshine. DAN: See ya, Gloria.GLORIA: All right. Take care, Dan. Bank robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder. Shit! You oughta frame that and stick it next to your bed. Write something nice on it. I'll send it to my parents. You know what I was thinking about? State penitentiary? What you mentioned the other day. Hawaii. You kidding me? You and me. I ain't kiddin' you. You kidding me? I mean it. You mean it? I mean it! Come here. [CHUCKLES] Come on, baby. I love you. You know that? [SIREN WAILING] [ALL APPLAUDING] There comes a time to reap the reward, Wade. Good to meet you, sir. Hi. How you doin'? Thank you so much. Pick up the child.Hmm? For God's sake, pick up the child. [ALL APPLAUDING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Thank you. Excuse me, Governor. You know how to make a margarita, amigo? Ted Stevenson, Wade. I want to congratulate you. What you did was pretty terrific. [CHUCKLING] Thanks. Thanks a lot. [SIGHING] Oh! A pretty understanding guy, isn't he? My best friend got married two days ago and I wasn't there. Best man never showed up. He knows what happened. He'll understand. That's not the point. I was supposed to be there. That's what it was all about. You're being a little hard on yourself. Nobody's perfect. Yeah. So I'll buy him a nice present, a nice silver tray, get something good engraved on it. I don't think that's really the problem. What's wrong? What's bothering you? I can't talk about it. Can't trust me, who can you trust? I'm screwed up. I got major, major problems. You don't wanna know about them. Wade, what are you afraid of? How can I understand if you won't even talk to me? [SIGHS] Two guys robbed that bank. Me and a guy I met on a freight. He had it planned in advance, by the time I knew what was goin' on, there was a gun in my face. You were forced to participate. Nobody can hold that against you. Who's gonna believe that? I think they'll believe it. They have to. You're a hero. [CLATTERING] [PANTING] Do you know who I am? It's Doyle Kennedy, isn't it? I got a gun, so don't do anything stupid. I got nothing against you. I came to talk. So, go ahead. I didn't do that bank alone. I had help. Wade Corey? The hero all you suckers have been goin' on about? He did that bank. He was my partner. Turns out he's more horseshit than hero. How do you like that for a con? Witnesses said one man. You should read your own press notices. They only saw one. About half a billion people in most of the free world would tell you to go fuck yourself. Well, he's not a hero. He's the kind of guy, where you look around in a tight spot and the foxhole's empty, his ass is over the hill. Except for when it comes to the money. I never saw a guy run so fast. Greedy bastard. Took it all for himself. He likes to play a little game called Fuck Your Buddy. Where's the proof, Doyle? You expect me to print that? Well, you go ahead and print what you like. I don't buy that shit. Newspapers are the truth? You make it up the same as the rest of us. [SIGHS] [TIRES SQUEALING] What do you have to do to get this? Ah! Take a deep breath, Wade. Can you smell that? Yeah! That's America! Hurry up, Wade. DOYLE: Come on! Let's move it! Come on! Let's go, Wade. All right, get your ass up here before you get yourself killed. [LAUGHS] You know, Wade. You really did it this time. You lied to me about that tree. I got no sympathy for liars. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [CHUCKLES] Go on, Wade. Pull the trigger. [WATER SPLASHING] Couldn't do it, huh? Couldn't pull the trigger. Well, that's the way it goes when you're a hero. [LAUGHS] What's the matter, Wade? Where you goin'? You don't want your money? Fifty per cent, that's what you said. C'mon, hero! Come and get what's yours, Wade. Come on, hero! Hero! [LAUGHS] Hero... Shit! [WHISTLING] [SIGHS] Get off my back.I'm splittin'. Where you gonna go? Thought we were goin' shopping. You wanna go shopping? Hey... You're the boss now, right? Uh-huh. Take the keys. Come on. Take the keys. Bye! Bye? Let go of me.Who do you think you're talking to? DOYLE: Get in the car.You're hurting me! DOYLE: Get in the car! You're hurting me. Quit bugging me! Shut the fuck up! Stupid bitch! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] LORI'S MOTHER: Lori? Lori? How ya comin', honey? Lori? [SIREN WAILING] [APPLAUDING] [CROWD CHEERING] Hi, Joe. Thanks for the kind words yesterday. There's two things I won't tolerate. One, you telling me what to do. Two, you talking about screwing other guys when you're with me. Make myself clear? [SIRENS BLARING] [GASPING] Oh, Jeez! Shit! [TIRES SQUEALING] What do we do? [SIRENS BLARING] WOMAN: Oh, no! Please! Please, babe! No! No! No! Stop! No! Come on! [WOMAN SCREAMING] [WOMAN GASPING] He's had enough! [WOMAN MOANING] Oh, shit! [GROANING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] WOMAN: Oh, there they are. I really don't know what to do... Governor, why the quick exit? What's goin' on? [REPORTERS CLAMORING] What's goin' on? The kid they were gonna give the medal to. What about him? He didn't want it. Decided to take the girl instead, Bayles' daughter. They eloped. They got the guy who robbed the bank. A roadblock on Peck Road. South of the turnpike. He make any kind of statement? Didn't have the chance. Shot him dead. Got the money back, though. [CHUCKLING] We'll see each other, you know that. I'll come back here. You go out there. Thanksgiving or Christmas, whenever we grab time. It doesn't work that way. You don't walk in and out of someone's life that easily. You don't come in from outta nowhere to pop up from behind some tree. Six months from now, you probably won't even want to. I might not even be there if you did. That's not true. It's different with us, you know that. I know what I want when it comes to you. It's me I gotta figure out. You can understand that, right? People change. Things never stay the same. [TRAIN APPROACHING] This is it for us. This whole thing's too crazy to ever get a second chance. [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] Damn it!
