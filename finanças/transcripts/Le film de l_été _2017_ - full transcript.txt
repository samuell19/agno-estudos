I loved that job. I've enjoyed doing it for years. But like with every job, you eventually reach a ceiling and you want to move on. - You've reached that ceiling? - For quite some time actually. What is this meeting you are going to? It's with a headhunter from the Confluence center. It's a massive thing in Lyon, a huge video and visual arts center. And the guy is looking for the head of the video department. That's great, it's going to be a great rebound. I really think I should leave. Try new things, meet new people... But it's not fucking done yet. - Philippe? - Yeah? How old are you? - How old I am? I'm 23. - For real? A little older. Guess. 33? Keep guessing. 36? A tiny bit older. - 37? - 37. Do you think 37 is old? Not that old. - What? - It's not that old. - And how old are you? - Nine and a half. "And a half". And three quarters or half, half? THE SUMMER MOVIE Your mother changed the schedule. We have three more days together. Don't ask me why. We can spend hours together without talking, whereas with anyone else... You feel obligated. It's akward if you don't talk, but not with her. - And you fuck like rabbits? - No. - Really? - Really. You're in complete harmony. The first week we were together... I mean for three days... You had a constant boner. OK... No stop, come on. - What? - No, I mean... It can be beautiful. I know. Fucking is a beautiful thing. Anyway... I'm sorry. You were saying? So after three days, she goes down to the store and she comes back with shower gel. - Shower gel? - Shower gel. Very poetic. She's a female Goethe. Stop it. She wanted it from behi... And since then, that's the shower gel I use. Awesome. Where is your meeting exactly? I don't know... The deal was that I wait for him at the station. I give him a call and he picks me up. When are you meeting him? - At one. It's five to. Just give him a call. I can drop you off at the address. He can wait another five minutes. - You lost the address? - I didn't lose the address... It was easier for him to pick me up at the station. That's what we had agreed on. I don't see how it's easier. Balthazar, sir, farewell. Give me a kiss. Enjoy the beach, the pretty girls and the pastis. Why do you have a scar here? I had surgery a long time ago. Take care of yourself. - No, thanks. - You could say "hi". You can sponsor a child for 5 euro a month. Leave me alone. You could at least say "hi". Hi, thanks, bye. It wouldn't kill you to smile. Bitch! I'm sorry I was harsh earlier. Don't worry, it's OK. I said : "The guy was nice..." And how are you? You are still in Lyon? Because for a moment I thought... I thought it would be... I mean... Since you have him for three more days... - Did you take ice packs? - Yes, several. Help youself. We each get two. Take small pieces. There you go. I knew it! How long? 26 seconds. If you brake in the bend, you'll swerve. Slow down before the bend and then accelerate. - Stay in the middle. - In the bend, you can... Stay on the inside, otherwise you'll waste time. Stay in the middle of the track. - Don't accelerate, don't brake. - And lose, like Aurélien. The Aurélien way. You just lose. - There you go. - Thank you. You know Alain Prost? That's me. I would have said Niki Lauda. The worst driver in the world. Could you take off your glasses? - It's a large one. It should... - Yes, it fits. - Are we there? - No. - How do you know? - It's a Quick restaurant. It looks like a club. You can't even tell the difference between a diner and a club? I know the South and here, clubs can look like that. It shows what great taste you have. DJ! Oh, shit. I can feel you're gonna come up with a bright theory. Am I right? I can feel I'm gonna be enlightened for years. We might find a you girl. We're going to find you a girl who wants to talk. Where is Philippe's chick? Where is she? Where is Philippe's chick? I can tell you where Philippe's woman is. She's in Brittany, with Philippe's car. And Philippe can't touch her. But Philippe's accoutant told Philippe that it was better not to get a divorce. So Philippe's woman is sleeping in Philippe's tax return. Of course it stings, my foot is stuck. No, no. Come on, stop it. Stop it, it's not funny. Fuck, no. You're trapped. Ha ha, very funny. This place sucks. It's prickly, it blows. Why is dad still sleeping? Why is he sleeping? Because he is tired. But you're not sleeping. - What? - You're not sleeping. Maybe he... He needs to sleep more than I do. - Why? - Because he's more tired than I am. Because he drives. Can I sit on your shoulders? On my shoulders? - Alright. - Thank you. Oh God. - Are you OK? - Yes. - Wow! - No, no, no, stop. - I had too much beer. - Stop it. Stop it! I'm scared! Stop it, I'm gonna fall. Stop it! Stop it! What? How long have you been not together? We have been separated for four years. Oh, OK. "OK" what? It's a lot. - It's a lot... - Four years is a lot. - It's a lot for you but it depends. If she was happy to live with you even if you weren't together, she would have stayed, right? You're very curious. I don't know. You can't separate things. The size of the house doesn't make any difference. One can think : "My love is too small. I have to leave." It's just like house. There is room for other people or not. - Do you have a little girlfriend? - No. - What? - No. No means yes. No. What's her name? I won't tell your mom. I don't have one. I do not have one. You don't want one? You're very curious. After all the questions you've asked me! Don't make me laugh. I told you everything, it's not fair. Alright, I have one. You gave up easily. What do you do with her? Nothing, we just go to school. And do you kiss or hold hands? No, neither of those. - What? - Neither of those. - How do you know you're in love? - We just do. Did you write her a little note saying "I love you"? Yes. You said : "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" Yes, it's the only way to communicate. There are other ways. You can kiss... We're not allowed to. At school, yes, but... You can stare in each other's eyes. Everyone will make fun of us. - It's tough being in love at your age. - Really tough. It wasn't that complicated for me. - Did you enjoy kissing her? - Of course. - What? - Yes. Yes! Of course, I enjoyed it. - What? - Of course I did. - Speak up. - Of course I did. Some people don't. Some people don't like oisters, others don't like kisses. - What do oisters have to do with... - Kisses? It can taste weird the first time. - That's it. - Right. You wouldn't put your tongue in anyone's mouth. - You did put the tongue, right? - No! - You have to stick your tongue in. - It's gross. Stop it, it's gross. Imagine your fighting with swords. - That's how it works. - Gross. Like a knight, with his little sword. Whatever. - What? - Whatever. If she takes her tongue out, you win. Well... You're sweating. Get your hat, it's hot. - Ew, tongues! - You pig. You act all tough now, but you will like it. Your thesis film was really good. I loved it. I remember the characters. There was a very free aspect to it. It wasn't formal. I really liked it. You know, actually, I had no idea what I was doing. That's surprising. We all thought you would continue, that you would keep making movies. You really had a good eye, a beautiful eye. I just heard your message. There was no service. I'm coming down, to give my son back to his mother, in Marseille. I'm taking the boat tonight. I'll see you tomorrow. Aurélien? I like this part. It's the end. I like this scene. Is he going to die if he follows the dolphin? Well unfortunately, yes. He could go up and down, up and down... No, because he will not always have his machine. He could swim up with his fins. He is 500 feet under the sea. But he survived 480 feet. Yes, but he can't swim back up with his fins. The guy decides to go with the dolphins, but he's killing himself. - Are you sure? - Yes. You can't live with the dolphins at 500 feet. How are you? Hi. - Thank you. How did it go? - Pretty good. Did you behave? - Want to grab a drink? - No, I'm gonna go. We have to go. How was your vacation? Good. It was good. It's gonna be fine. Can I have his suitcase? - There. Careful. - Thanks. Here. Time to say goodbye. Bye, son. Have a safe trip. Bye, Balthazar. You don't want to say goodbye? Why don't you want to say goodbye to me? What was that? I don't want you to go. - Come here. - No! I said no! - What's wrong? - Let me down. We have to go, honey. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you! Subtitling : Marianne Henry.
