Kim Chang-Min appeared at Kaipu Cave in 2010 At that time, more than 13,000 small donkeys were released In just two days, I escaped to Jeollabuk-do It seems that only two days to eat milk and bread. You shouldn't say words like that What did he do at that time? He looked for it in the gutter in Pudong Do you want to catch Kim Chang-Min? That can't be done with normal and rational thinking. Must be humane and sociality Full of emotional meaning Simple, simple You damn jerk ... bitch... Kim Chang-Min said after being arrested in 2011. There is only one woman He loves so much.

Wow Kim Chang-Min when he runs away from prison in 2009 Did the woman who helped him escape too? Diverse work is also risky There are no similarities Even if that's the case, there will be similar women. In the end, there were a few more children What do you think about sorting out these women? it's a matter of love ratio Because the distance traveled becomes longer, the amount of pull increases.

Now, if you dare lie, I will kill you. In fact, the real boss of the Central Party is ... The one who killed was Yoshihara's boss - Are you talking about gangsters? - Correct Yoshihara's group was supported by government forces Fight against Yamato, Japan's biggest gang After seven years of war Bringing the Yakuza together Just like the same era from Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Yoshihara's group was annexed throughout Japan they use their own large financial resources To find prey, I set my goal to go abroad. he is not a Korean pop star A group of their gang also marched from abroad. About 5 years ago ... Not long before gathering some of its members to establish the Central Party. Come to me He said that it would be my strong support Just give a sense of loyalty You will take me to the strongest gang boss in Korea Good traitor Quiet Yes, there is something to say, Then you secretly erase your loyalty for the Japanese gangster Why did you do that? That ... It's all because of medicine What? Drug? Correct He called me to the warehouse one day. I say to show her next career With enormous financial resources from the acquisition of a savings office he bought a machine called a human Starting with organ sales he Use money to buy his superiors Even changing the law And also successfully acquired a pharmaceutical company Organ trade and drug factory Even though I'm also a gangster who has no crime. But it is really difficult to accept Really like hell on earth. Even his subordinates died. like a bum plus another missing person And the children who just came out of the orphanage by offering him a job as a lure he didn't just let them work but also used as a trial tool Exactly the way the Japanese emperor Also conducting experiments on humans Its technical strength is extraordinary. The making is the same as ordinary medicine Something you've never heard of Then why does he want to kill you suddenly? But you guys ... Who are you guys? You don't need to know, it's useless. I am not dead today. I already burned this incense. so you know Yoo Mi-Young. We are a group with him. This is the end of this problem From the community entertainment room to the karaoke room They open connections to sell drugs.

This is the truth of the world Do you know me? Actually what is the need to do this This is more than just a bribe I look like a wizard in the search field. This is not a random nickname. Yoshihara is still a man who took care of you until now. even though he beat the bad guys with bribes It seems like I have spent a lot of effort to raise you, jerk Then, do you know why I am looking for you? Very clear to find money that was misused by No Sang-Sik That's Team Leader Oh Goo-tak and we took the money. Let's make a black pot and disguise it as an accident. Don't wear handcuffs Is it necessary to hold a cremation here? Geez, what a smart kid. Is that a high ranking child? Your father and you are too romantic, that's the problem. Yeah, the world is not so beautiful. It seems you will die like your father. Son of a bitch Wait, don't look at your head. Is it necessary to leave evidence for Mochagan?

Ask for help? connect with me, somebody, to ask for help ... Aren't we going to catch people? we have to help each other As the saying goes Someone please answer that. Then listen to what you ask for. all gangsters in Incheon are very famous This may take years It's too easy for the Central Party to take over. Too quiet There is clearly someone who planned it So I have to find the base. Is there a way to find a place that big? If you want to do something big, You need someone.
