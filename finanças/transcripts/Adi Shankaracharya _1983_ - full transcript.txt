Mother! Mother... Mother! - Satyakama, my son! Mother. Tell me lineage. Mother, what lineage I belong to? I wish to be initiated to Brahminism. Tell me my lineage I wish to be initiated to Brahminism. Tell me my lineage Mother! In truth, I do not know who your father was I was merely a humble servant of him. Excuse me for it. You are Jabala's son. You are Satyakama, son of Jabala. Tell your teacher. It will suffice Revered sir, I know not my lineage I am Satyakama, son of Jabala So I am Satyakama, son of Jabala. None but a learned person can speak so, I shall initiate you So, for truth of it I shall initiate you. Such was the faith of the ancients in truth. Believe me EXCUSE US, EXCUSE US Shankara in Banaras, the holy city Letters combine to form words The letter is imperishable Grammar is essential for understanding meaning Hear the sound of a vessel falling Learn "dunkritakara" from it You get what your deeds are here itself Your deeds are decides the plight Vishnu (the friend believed drowned) Hey, Shankara! I am fortunate. Please accept me a disciple As you wish. Yes, you will be a Padmapada We bow at your feet. True, he is a great Pandit He is well known to part with knowledge.

Pray to Govindam, pray to lord Hail to Shankarcharya! Hail! Hail! The whole world praises you Before the ends comes I have to make a declaration ...like the Nachiketa knew of his end May you excel forever! Death, you know I won't live long Nor do I wish a long life Move away ! An untouchable ! An untouchable is here. Let us keep away He is untouchable. Keep distance from him. Move away. Move away. From whom ? From my body ? Or from my Inner Self ? The body is of the Earth, and so, untouchable The Inner Self is pure and Eternal From whom are you tying to keep distance? Knowledge is the Universal Self All worldly creations are illusions Whoever knows this truth, whatever his caste, is my teacher Even being an untouchable you've taught me like a Guru This place where you stand is center of knowledge like Kashi to me Kashi it enlightening to everyone This place itself is Kashi to me I have got the enlightenment what I could get at Kashi. Shankara observes a man on several occasions Darth is the real Truth After unsuccessful attempts, the boy looks straight at the sun Shankara meditates on an Upanishadic verse on the Eye "The living breath residing in the body is a Prince waited upon by the select Gods God of Wrath is in the red of the eye Rain God is in the Eye's moisture Lord of Light is in the Pupil Lord of Speech is in the Iris Goddess of life is in the White of the Eye He who knows this Truth is free from wants, and liberated Revered sir, this boy was born dumb and seems insane at times My friend, who are you ? Where are you from ? Where are you going? Do you recall Puranas? I am knowledge, bright and pure, as the clear sky Everyone only looks at the physical form but the real form is soul This boy perceives the eternal truth of self, without effort I will accept him as my disciple We are obliged Badarayana, on whose aphorisms Shankara commented, approaches Are you Shankara, the disciple of Govinda ? Be seated What can I do for you? I hear that you commented on the aphorisms of Badarayana? Explain one of them - Which one ? Ask anything as you wish. The most important one : "How is the body linked to the Earth" Shankara gives an explanation of the origin of man as put forth in the Upanishadic speculations The soul leaves the body and enters another after death. This should be known. Soul travels in cosmos and take up a new body. Think over it. What's before and after the death. Soul transits from a body to another. Life comes and goes. The question remain, from where it comes. There are many questions. The formation of the body from water is explained by the principle of five oblations: Faith, Soma,(Moon), Rain, Food, Seed Give an elaborate explanation as to where from this eternity appears and goes. Does that also mingles with the elements? I shall clarify Every doubts must be cleared. The answer could be hundreds. Three elements ultimately become one with the earth. Shankaracharya recites a verse from the "Chandogya Upanishad" The Heaven is Fire The Sun, its Fuel The Rays, its Smoke The Day, its Flame The Moon, its Embers The Stars, its Sparks Into this Fire the Gods offer the Oblation of Faith Out of this, the divine drink, Soma arises The Rain God is indeed the Fire, The Air, its Fuel The Cloud, its Smoke The Lightning, its Flame The Thunderbolt, its Embers The Thunder its Sparks Into this Fire, the Gods offer the oblation of Soma Out of this Oblation, Rain arises The Earth, its Fire The Year, its Fuel The Sky, its Smoke The Night, its Flame The Four Directions, its Embers The Intermediate Directions, its sparks Into this Fire, the Gods offer the Oblation of Rain Out of this Oblation, arises Food Man indeed is the Fire Speech, his Fuel Breath, his Smoke Tongue, his Flame Eyes, his Embers The Ears, his Sparks Into this Fire, the Gods offer the Oblation of Food Out of this Oblation the Seed arises Woman is the Fire Into this Fire, the Gods offer the Oblation of the Seed Out of this Oblation The Foetus arises At the fifth Oblation the Oblation called Water , comes to be designated as Man The Foetus covered with membrane, Lies within the mother's womb Remains for a prescribed time And then is born into the world Very good Go ahead and complete your work Make it free of mistakes When you have doubts, ask the others May others write such commentaries too Some stay away from the World Some can never stay free There are others, too, who stay in the world, and yet are free Prayag, Uttar Pradesh Kumarila, an elder of Shankara and an authority on Veda rituals.. Is seen immolating himself Shankara, I am an expert on orthodoxy and rituals My aim has been to uphold the Vedas and to thwart the atheists I committed a mistake, though This is the punishment I suffer Why must you suffer this way ? I lived incognito among the Buddhists to learn their philosophy So I am immolating myself as an atonement. WWI. Why so? Does merely posing does he become a knowledgeable? Then I went posing as Bodhist. My teacher, Dharmapala, decried the Vedic faith that those who follow dharma they surrender to lord Once Dhranwpal appeared before him and described the Veda. Seeker devotee! My eyes shed involuntary tears He then knew my true leanings Knowing that I had cheated them, the monks pushed me downhill I fell into an abyss and lost one of my eyes Had I said, "Eternal Vedas protect me", no harm would've come to me But I said, "If the Vedas are eternal, then no harm will come to me Veda's proof will it self provide its proof. I decided to immolate myself to atone for sinning against my Teacher Learned men praise your commentaries. Ved daharma is always victorious Yes, Ved dharma always wins. Would you kindly enlighten me on shastras ? So that my atonement is achieved. For this you will have to take a vow But then, when dying. Where is the time to talk to you ? Master, I have heard ample praises of you I highly respect you for your what you have written I wish to leave my body Learned sir, please relent and stop this immolation Possible. If it's acceptable in the meeting of Veda experts I find you have true knowledge by which I am at peace and no desire All my sins are absolved now having seen you and with your deep meditation Being your disciple is the greatest thing You continue with your creation and good work Mahishmati, the banks of the River Narmada Shankara looks for the house of Mandana Misra Shankara looks for the house of Mandana Misra Dear death, don't meet him first Then there will be no one to comment on my work Then there will be no one to comment on my work Who know what's in the future? Have you taught this to him? Who has taught him such great thought No one taught him. There is silence here. Let us look Welcome to you, divinity personified What do you want? I came here to beg for debate, not for rice Want to debate as alm! Great! Let us eat first What you say and your deeds are what you get accordingly And what is life belongs to the Agnihotri sect Deeds and karma are the ultimate for being Hail! Hail! What do you wish ? - I am hungry Here take it. What is the diagram for ? To ensnare you ! For the comprehension of the truth and liberator of the society... He be the victorious! Victorious! Does your parrot like grapes ? He likes only pepper He likes it? Eat these grapes ! They are sweet Knowledge is the essence of Dharma. Your deeds depend on your knowledge. We need enlightenment from you. Your karma rules your life. What's your life? You only love the taste of chilli. But have you ever tasted grapes? Sweets and fruits are plenty here Yet, you prisoner, prefer pepper. When will you be released ? When you'll attain your freedom? Your teachings... ...will forever lead people to tread on a right path. Your wisdom shall guide the society. Through Karma, I am told you get salvation You are right. But when ? All right, all right. See these ants. How many more births do they need to be liberated ? You have a pair of wings and can fly to heaven if you wish You need only to emerge from the cage. Do you want grapes ? No, I only want to be released. Please open the cage Shankara is the sun of the spiritual sky Before the rays of knowledge, the ordinary sun is pale as a moon Revered sir, make me your disciple I accept you. You are Sureshwara Shankara, the unvanquished scholar, uncrowned king of the spiritual world Sir, would you enter into a debate with me ? Mother, truth is beyond debate. It is experienced and not discussed Let us move away from verbalism Be our foster Mother and lead us May the revered one be victorious lam beyond pain and pleasure Virtue and sin do not touch me I am supreme knowledge Why is Vedic religion accepted only in India ? India is the home of the Vedas But knowledge of self is open to all Kashmir, Kamarup (Assam ) and Kanyakumari are the three corners Varanasi is the centre India symbolizes the mystic wheel (Tantric Chakra ) An ode to the mother Why do you always laugh at me? I will leave you now. I have some work to do The sun in the sky, and Shankara in my heart, are both memorable The atmosphere is calm and peaceful This is Sringeri and the Thunga river Buddhists stopped animal sacrifices These ritualists offer flowers as sacrifice How does one put an end to it ? You have realised the futility of rituals You are truly enlightened I would be delighted if you commented on my work. Yes, delighted All of you come. Come. Food is ready Why is it none of you wants to eat ? Why are you not accepting her offering? They resent Sureshwara commenting on your work True. They are not happy about it Why this envy? Why unnecessarily harass? Hastamalakais a better scholar Experience is more important Do you still carry old grudges? Padmapada is better qualified between you four... If all four aren't of the same thought and voice... what chance is there for Vedic thought to spread? Our ancestors were liberal in thought Due to them, Vedas were preserved Philosophy will perish soon if people quarrel among themselves Let Padmapada undertake the task You can give me that task Why? Why do you want to do this? Pardon us. Let Sureshwara write Master, kindly tell us My decision is final. Write yourself We crave your pardon. We were jealous We should see that the Vedic religion is kept alive Let us go and eat I intend sending Padmapada...
