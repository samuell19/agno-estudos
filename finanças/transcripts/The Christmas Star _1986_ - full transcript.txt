(Lucky cackles) No, Horace. I spent my whole lifetime for the money. I cared for nothing else, no one else, and no one cared for me. I must be dreaming. I was forgotten as quickly as the last penny I spent. What do you want? Not your money, Horace. You. (evil laughter) (screams) (John sobs) (child sobbing) (cackles) You beware, McNickle. A man with no Christmas spirit will die alone and forgotten. (evil laughter) (laughs) McNickle, you snake, the last laugh is mine. Heh-heh-heh-heh. What do you want from me? Take my hand, partner. I'll change. I swear it. Just get me out of here. It's too late, Horace. (laughs) I don't want to end up alone and forgotten. (Horace's voice) Where'd you hear that one, old man? Your mommy? (laughs) I'm not gonna end up like you, Lucky. You already have, Horace. (thunder) I saved a seat for you. No. (evil laughter) (cackling trails off) (thunder rumbles) Billy. Why are you up so late? You OK? Sure, Dad. Never seen a clearer night. Don't you think you'd better go back to bed? Santa might never come. He'll come. (♪ "The Star-Spangled Banner" ♪) (snoring) (door creaks) (McNickle) I hear you've been bad-mouthing me. I... I... Toughen up, Sumner. What kind of sissy are you, anyways? Who are you? Who do you think? This isn't possible. Look at me when I talk to you. You hear me? Answer me. Yes. Yes what? Yes... Santa. We're gonna sit down and have ourselves a little talk. You've been a very bad boy. Psst! I knew you'd come. Listen to me. You got to understand. I'm not who you think I am. What? But you can't stop believing in things. You hear me? Never do that. Never! I'm trying to tell you, I'm not... (sirens wail) He forgot his list. Santa! Billy! Get back. Get back. (Stewart) Billy! (Clara) Billy! You traitor!
