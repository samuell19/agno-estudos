Hurry to the prayer. God is great. God is great. - God is great. - God is great. - God is great. - God is great. - God is great. - God is great. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Mom. Zahra. Zahra. Oh God. Oh, no. Zahra. Oh God. Zahra. - Zahra. - Mom. How could this happen? - Zahra. - Mom. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah. - Zahra. Zahra. - Mom. The most beautiful view on earth is... when we see a body of a person being put in a grave. On that moment,... we have a chance to think about our sins. Sins of the past, present... and of the future. There is no God but Allah. And Mohammad is the messenger of Allah. =Roh Fasik= (2 Years Later) Why don't you go pray in the mosque? Hasan, how is Akbar doing? I haven't seen him in the mosque for a while. Yes, Abi, since his wife passed away, I haven't go to his house again. If you can, find a time to visit him. Yes, Abi, I will. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - Bye. - Bye. I miss mom. I want things to be just like before. Praying together with mom. Oh God, if my father and my mother did something wrong,... why don't You just punish me? Our Lord, give us in this world that which is good... and in the Hereafter that which is good... and protect us from the punishment of the Fire. Peace be upon you. Akbar. Have a seat, Hasan. Abi asking about you. It has been a while since you go to the mosque. Coffee for you. Thank you, Ren. I still can't accept the death of my wife, San. And until now... police haven't found the murderer. I know, but the police keeps trying. Now, let God do the rest. Start going to the mosque again. - Because... - There's no other place... who can promise peace besides God's house? Yes. I know that. Akbar,... we are best friends since childhood. We learn and recite Quran together. This is the first time I see you behave like this. Throw it away, Akbar. Throw you anger and vengeful away. - Your wife is no longer here. - I know! I know that Zahra is dead but Amira needs her mother! Amira also needs her father. But the older version of him. - What do you know? - Hit me. If it gives you peace, hit me! Ustaz Hasan. I miss you, Ustaz Hasan. I miss you too, Amira. Why don't you come with me to the mosque? We'll learn Quran again. Amira. Ustaz Hasan is in hurry. Don't forget to pray, don't forget to read Quran. Will do, Ustaz. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. I'm tired. I want to rest. Honey! Honey, open the door! Honey! Honey! I'm sure it wasn't a dream, it was so real! - Leave it, Ren. Maybe you were just... - You went outside last night, right? Last night you texted me that you went out for a while. But, I can't find the message now. Thank God, Akbar is fine. It's just that he's not accepting his wife's death yet. At least you came and gave him a moral support. But, Abi... there's something different about Akbar. He is more... he's angrier and vengeful. Sometimes man prioritize their desires more than God. Though humans themselves will not be able... to know what God knows. Zahra. Zahra? - Zahra. - Leave everything to God. No, Zahra. I can't, Zahra. I can't lose you. I can't accept it. I need to know who killed you, Zahra. Honey,... leave everything to God. After that, you'll know who did this to me. No. No. Zahra... Zahra! Zahra! Zahra. Zahra! Zahra! Honey, what happened? I'm okay. Just a nightmare. - Did you forget to pray before bed? - Don't lecture me! I'm your leader. You have no idea how many prayers I've recited. But for what? I am... I will get you something to drink. Renata, why do you lock the door? Renata, open the door! Renata! - Honey! Help! - Renata! Honey! Honey! Renata. Good afternoon, Abi. Isn't greeting is much better in Islamic way... than in what you said earlier? I am sorry. You have return, Akbar. Abi,... I'm in a great trouble. And I don't know what to do. Until now,... I still don't know who killed Zahra. Akbar,... forget this. Leave everything to God. I'm sorry. I will never forgive the person who murdered my wife! Calm yourself, Akbar. God said in Quran,... "God will not burden someone but according to his ability". When you leave all your problems to God,... God will answer to all of your problems. I'm sorry, Abi. Almighty God. Did I not command you, O Children of Adam... not to follow Satan... Go on, Amira. for he is truly your sworn enemy. Amira. Amira. Amira. Amira. Let's play. Come on. Come here. - I made you breakfast. - Okay, Mom. So, what did the master said? Abi. - He doesn't like to be called master. - Okay. What did he say? Is our house haunted? Ren, I've lived here for a long time. There's nothing here. Then, according to him, what we should do? Abi just said, this house needs to be cooled... by prayers and Quran recital. Tonight, I will go out for a while. Where are you going? You don't have to worry, I won't be long. God Almighty speaks the truth. Mom! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Why do you call me late at night? - Mom is being possessed. Oh no. - Where is your father? - Dad is not home. - I'll be there. - Okay. Peace be with you. - Peace be with you. - Peace be with you too. Amira, Akbar's daughter, has just called me. She said her mother is being possessed. Oh no. The problem is, Akbar isn't home. If I go there, I'm afraid this will be a slander. If it is to help, go, Hasan. God is omniscient. Alright, Abi. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. - Ustaz, please help mom. - Yes. Where is she? - She's upstairs. - Okay. Peace be upon you, Renata. I'm here to help you. Ustaz,... why are you in my room? Don't you know that my husband is away? - Amira, call your father. - Alright, Ustaz. You Devil,... never hide behind kindness! There is no power and no strength except with God. God is great! Believer, who are you? I am Hasan, servant of God. - Enemy of the Devil! - I have no business with you! I just want this woman! What do you want from this woman? Her life! Renata? You Devil! Get out from this woman's body! Or I will banish you with holy verses of Quran. Get out! I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Everyone turns to their own direction of prayer. So compete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are,... God will bring you all together for judgment. Surely God... is Most Capable of everything. Surely God... is Most Capable of everything. God is great! - Bar. Bar. - Renata. - Bar, listen to me. - Out. Get out! Go away! - Bar! - Mom! Mom! Mom! - Akbar, listen. - Shut up! - Akbar... - You're going too far! Listen, all this time you always talk about kindness. But it turns out, you have a desire for your best friend's wife! - Akbar, I just wanted to help. - Help what? To help satisfy your lusts! Right? Now leave. Leave! Peace be upon you. What did you do last night? - Honey, I didn't do anything. - Don't lie to me! Did Amira know about this? - You misunderstood. - I don't get it wrong. I'm wrong having married to you! Honey, have a drink. How's Akbar's wife? Better? She's okay, thank God. But what I did to her... becomes a slander. I don't understand why Akbar behaves like that. His heart has turned to... djinn's nest. But after all, he is your best friend. You should help him. Help him get back on track. No. I don't want to be part of his problems anymore. I... I give up. Let him solve his own problems. Honey,... the destruction of this world is not because of the many bad people... but because of the silence of the good people. It's time for you to sleep. Dad, is it true that our house is haunted? Is mom in danger? I don't want to lose another mom. Amira, there's no ghost in this house. And mom is fine too. You don't have to worry, I'm here. But you're always away at night. Where do you go actually? You don't need to think about it. Just rest. Come, say your prayer. With Your name, O God, I die and I live. God. I'm not making this thing up. It was right here What? There's nothing here. - Honey, we have to move out, please! - Watch your mouth! Do you think it's that easy to move out? Well, do something! Either we clean the house,... or call someone to banish the devils. Honey, please. I'm so scared. Now try to think. If there is a devil in this house, why it's only you who experienced it? - Why don't I? - You sensed it last night, right? You were locked in the bathroom. That doesn't explain things. I didn't saw anything. Honey, please, this one already explains everything. Please. We have to move out from this house! Honey! I can't live this life without you, Zahra. Especially for Amira. It's hard for her to accept all this, Zahra. What should I do, Zahra? Dad! Dad! Uncle Kemal is here! Yes, dear. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Greet him. - How are you? - Come in. Drinks for you. Thank you, Ustadzah. It's just coffee. Thank you, Aisyah. Thank you. Have a drink. What brings you here in the morning, Mal? It's about Ustaz Akbar. What about him? I saw him at his wife's grave. Isn't it normal, Mal? It's not normal if he doesn't go to his wife's grave. Going to a cemetery is our reminder on death. But he went there at midnight. - Who said that? - I saw him myself. Mom. You surprised me. What are you doing? Honey, help me, I can't stand it anymore. I'm always haunted! Seems like it wants to hurt me! So, what do you want me to do? - Call Ustaz Hasan again? - Whatever you must do! I really can't stand it anymore. No! Honey! Stop! Mom? Amira? Amira! Don't come in here, dear! Amira, no! No, Amira. - Amira, don't come in here! - Mom? - Mom, it's me, Amira. - No. Amira, don't! Amira, no! - Amira, don't! - Mom! - Mom, it's me, Amira. - Amira, don't come in here. - Mom. - Amira! Mom! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Wake up, Dad! Dad! What's going on, dear? It's mom. Come on, Dad! Wake up! - What happens to her? - Come on, Dad. Come on! Hurry, Dad! Hurry! Ren? Renata! Renata! Oh my God. Ren. Come on. Come on. Hey. Ren, wake up. Ren! Ren. Renata. Akbar,... life is inseparable from two cases. Which is test and trial. Man will be tested in their lives with the things they don't like... and the things they like. But Abi, why... God said in Quran... "Those who surrender to God... God shall fulfill all of his needs." What about Renata, Abi? There are two possibilities for people who sees djinn. It's either that the person is a liar... or the person is in alliance with the djinn. Come here, dear. Don't be afraid. Mom, are you alright? Djinn promised to keep away a child... Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. - Hi, Ustaz. - Hi, dear. Amira, get inside, dear. Bar, we... Abi sent us here. We'd like to check on you. And Renata too. Come in. Oh God. Oh God. This is her situation. So, you're letting her sleep although it's near evening prayer? I have no choice. Because every time she hears the call for prayer... she acts like a madman. Oh no. When she's possessed, did she say something? I have no idea. I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say, O Prophet, "He is God, One and Indivisible. God, the Sustainer, needed by all. He has never had offspring, nor was He born. And there is none comparable to Him." In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say, O Prophet, "I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak,... from the evil of whatever He has created,... and from the evil of the night when it grows dark,... and from the evil of those witches casting spells by blowing onto knots,... and from the evil of an envier when they envy." Ustaz? In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say, O Prophet, “I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind,... the Master of humankind,..." I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. There is no God but He, the Alive, the All-Sustaining. Neither doze overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. Who can intercede with Him without His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them. And they encompass nothing of His knowledge... except what He wills. His chair extends to the Heavens and to the Earth... and it does not weary Him to look after them. And he is the High, the Supreme. - Mal. - Mal. Kemal. - Are you alright? - I'm alright. Bar, we'll leave now. About that day... I'm sorry. I already forgive you before we meet today. Peace be upon you. Oh God. Bar, she left a necklace, right? Be careful. I seek forgiveness in God. I seek forgiveness in God. There is no power and no strength... except with Allah. God is great! Who are you? Get out from her, if not... I will burn you with the holy verses of Quran. With the permission of God, get out! I'm not coming out. If I come out, my master won't feed me. Where do you from? The deepest. The hottest! Oh God. The 7th level of hell. She made a deal with my master. She did not keep it. What agreement? To make Prophet Mohammad's follower... walks away... and make them... our ally! I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. And We revealed... to Musa,... "Throw your staff." Then of a sudden, it began to swallow all that they had concocted. So, the truth prevailed... and what they were doing became a nullity. So, they were overcome there... and turned humiliated. And the sorcerers were constrained to fall in prostration. They said,... "We believe in the Lord of the worlds,... the Lord of Musa and Harun." "The Lord of Musa and Harun." "The Lord of Musa and Harun." That Djinn will always haunt Renata, Abi. - There's nothing I can do. - Do you think I can? Making an agreement with djinn... must be settled directly with the person involved. They are God's creatures. They are smart. Only stupid humans who wants to make alliances with djinn... for worldly interest. So what do we have to do? We'll visit Renata. Only she can solve it. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say, "O disbelievers,... I do not worship that which you worship,... nor do you worship the One whom I worship. And neither I am going to worship that which you have worshipped,... nor will you worship the One whom I worship. For you is your faith, and for me, my faith." Stop it! Dad! Help! Renata! Dad! Dad! Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Abi. Please come in. Akbar. Where's your wife? Upon your permission, I wish to talk directly with her. Let me call her. Renata,... we're here to ask you something. We hope you'll answer honestly. Renata,... have you ever made an agreement with someone... who is an ally to a djinn... or a shaman? I have made such agreement. Oh God. What worldly things that blinds you, Renata? I... I'm sorry. Do you... do you still remember the place? Yes. Akbar, Renata,... you have to go soon. Before it's too late. Very well, Abi. Renata. Where are you going? To Wonorogi. Don't go too far. You won't know your way home. Thank you for the warning, Sir. Are you sure this is the way? Amira, you don't need to worry. Your father will be alright. I'm not worried about dad, Ustaz. I'm worried about mom. What is that, dear? I found this one in the storage. This one, I found it on mom's room. (Dialogue of Djinn and Man) I seek forgiveness in God. There is no God but Allah. Mohammad is the messenger of Allah. Hasan, please go after Akbar and Renata. - Okay, Abi. - Ustaz, I'm coming with him. Yes. Is this the right house? Ren? I'm going to ask you once more. Is this the house? Yes, this is the house. I've been waiting for you. Why do you deny the agreement? You let greetings and holy verses from the Quran in that house! I tried. But I can't keep doing it. Help me! Help! Renata! Renata! Renata! Ren. Ren. Renata. Oh God. Ren. Ren. How could it be like this? Ren? Forgive me, Honey. No, Ren. It's my fault. I did it. Why? What have I done to you, Ren? How could you do this to me? To my family! I'm sorry. I was too in love with you. This man made me fall in love. But there is a big wall that is blocking me. I can grant your wish... but we must have an agreement first. You have to bear the risk yourself. - What kind of agreement, Ma'am? - Kill his wife! And make the whole house not to believe anymore! But what if I can't? If you deny the agreement that has been made,... then he will enter to claim you! Who? Adnanbatzirah... from the deepest and the hottest. I'm really sorry, honey. Ren... - Keep her treasure. - I... Be vengeful, human. If you forgive her,... you have to die! Open this! Open it! Help! You have to die. Renata, it's me! Bar. Akbar. Oh God. Akbar, what happened? San, turns out... Renata did it all. - Renata? - Yes. Kemal, let's go. Renata. - Renata. - Oh God. We surely belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. Believers! I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. And We revealed... to Musa,... "Throw your staff." Then of a sudden, it began to swallow all that they had concocted. So, the truth prevailed... and what they were doing became a nullity. Believers must die! I seek forgiveness in God. You Devil! I will banish you with the holy verses of Quran. With permission of God. I seek refuge in God from the outcast Devil. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. So, they were overcome there... and turned humiliated. And the sorcerers were constrained to fall in prostration. They said,... "We believe in the Lord of the worlds,... the Lord of Musa and Harun." "The Lord of Musa and Harun." "The Lord of Musa and Harun." Glory to Allah. Praise be to Allah. There is no God but Allah. There is no power, no strength but from Allah. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad. - Patient, dear. - Amira. God said in Quran... "Your God knows what is in your heart." If you are a good person,... then God is forgiving for those who repent. Oh God. Oh God. What have I done... to have this kind of punishment?
