Get down! You can't do that! Stay the fuck down! Don't move! I will fucking end you! What the fuck is wrong with you? He's gonna make us. He's on his phone. Get down! Are you crazy? Oh, what? Do you see that? You fucking idiot! Wake the fuck up,. Ow! Ah! Lovely. Fresh air. Hey. Hey, get back here. Killian! All right, all right. Don't get your panties in a bunch. You got to fucking help me with him? He dead? I-- it doesn't matter. He's not staying in this car. Help me pull them out of here. Oh, hey Lisa. Killian! All right, all right. Don't see why you got to make this a thing. I'll show you a fucking thing. Come on. Come on big guy. Is he dead? If he is, he's better off. Shut the fuck up. Come on. Get him inside. I'll clear space for him. Lay him over here. Not the fanciest of places to hang out, isn't it? If you're not going to help, man. Well then, fuck that shit. I'm not a doctor. He shouldn't have gotten himself shot. Just-- Shut up, all right. I got a med bag. Let me grab it in the other room. Fuck. Oh, Jesus. What the fuck you got all that for? Did the bullets exit? Uh! Oh. Yeah. They looked like they all passed through. Lucky. All right. I have to clean his wounds and stop the blood flow. Why? Do you think you're a doctor with all that? I know he'll die from bleeding out if we don't stop it. You think you can stitch him up? Not well. What do you have me do? I'll help you. Yeah. This just ain't right. No, it's not. Should have ducked. outside. Hm? Outside. Now. Fuck. Trent's going to be pissed. So, what's up old man? What the-- What? You going to shoot unarmed man? Too bloody right, I am. What's your problem? You're my fucking problem. This is all your fault. Why? Ha. Shit. I wasn't the one who wasn't paying attention to the security guards. That was Geoff. You should really think twice about who deserves what. Nobody had to die. Everyone does sometime. Yeah, you got that right. Come on. Don't be an asshole. Those people were innocent. We're supposed to be professionals so fucking act like one. Just give me back my gun, OK? Go for it, asshole. Here we go, Willow. There you go, sweetheart. You don't all have to stop on my account of being here. Where are the others? Inside. You get the shit? Yeah, but at a cost. Goddamn. Come on, baby. You OK Willow? I love you, baby. The. Maybe we should lower that gun, Alex. Come on man. I'm not I'm not sure what happened. I'm just thinking maybe it's a better idea if we just put down the gun, man. Maybe think about why we're here, why we're doing this. It's your last chance. Just, fucking. Did we at least get what we came for? Yeah, we got it. Good. OK, let's see. Hey! You got what you wanted. Yeah, well, we got what we wanted, Alex. He's your responsibility. Do whatever you want with this guy. OK. What in the holy hell is going on here? Keep it pinched. Shit, it's slipping. Oh, good. You're back. You're missing all the fun. Oh, fuck. Shit. I'm sorry. Wait, I need your hand still. Looking like a bad day, but hey, at least you get to play doctor again, huh? Hold it tight this time. That's what I was doing. Is he the only one shot? No-- Yes. The only one of us but some others. Well, what happened? You didn't tell him? Can any one finger you? Did anyone else see you guys do the job? Hardly anyone left. What happened to him? Him? He's just a little sleepy. Hey, I need your hands. I ain't going to be happy, am I? No, no, no way. And I had such a nice ride in, too. Yeah, really nice trails right there around back behind the gulch. Yeah, seems I don't have much time to take Willow out anymore, and well, that's a fucking shame that is. OK. I think that's it. That gonna hold? Maybe for a while. I mean, a real doctor is going to have to redo it. He needs work done internally, anyway. We need to dump him off at the hospital. Ain't nobody going nowhere. He needs a doctor. Just give us our cut. I'll take him to the hospital myself. No, can't do that. You can, and you will. Job is done. Pay us. Actually, no I can't, and I won't. The job ain't done. You're going to have to wait. What? No. That wasn't the agreement. Actually, yes it was, Alex. The deal was we do the job, we get the diamonds, and you pay us. Well, there's the diamonds. Now you fucking pay us. OK. OK just take it down a notch. Charles, you're going to get paid. You're just going to have to wait. OK? We've got a little over three hours until the buyer shows up. The buy comes, I'll give him the diamonds, a little something else I owe him, and then we all walk away with some cash. Capeesh. Until then, let's just all chill the fuck out. OK? What if he dies before that? Risk of job. This is fucked. We need to get him to a doctor. He needs a fucking doctor? Here's your phone. Go on, grab your phone. Use it. I picked this location for a reason. You want to know why? Because calling someone, well, it ain't an option. And when are you going to get it through your fucking skulls that there is what we want, but then there is how it is. And this here's the fucking ladder! And here we're staying, and there is no way of reaching anyone to get any help. And, hey, I'm sorry he's been shot. I am. And I really hope he doesn't die. I mean, fucking truly. I mean that. But it is what it is. Now, speaking about how it is, this was supposed to be a simple job. I don't think there was ever a reason for a shot to ever been fired. I mean, not even fucking once, man! Not once! I'm going to tell you something. We're so fucking close to having this deal done that I ain't going to take any chances on you all acting like fucking schoolkids. So here's how it's going to be. I want you to give me all your guns, and I mean all of them. I ain't asking, Alex. I'm telling you, man. I need the guns. Don't test me. One is all I need. Come on. OK. That's a good start, all right. OK. OK. Oh, you know what, Alex? I'm going to be needing them keys, to too. What was that? I'm going to be needing the keys to the car, man. Give them over here. You're having a laugh, right? Come on, man. You think I-- if I ain't going to trust you with the fucking guns, you think I'm going to trust you with the car keys? No, man. You know what we got to do now? We got to be friends. We got to chill. We got to cook some fucking s'mores maybe. Tell some fucking funny stories. Come on, man. A couple of hours and we're done. Give me the keys, Alex. Makes us all even, doesn't it? Some of us more than others. OK. Are you going to tell me what happened, or am I going to have to ask him? What the hell? Who the fuck hit me? I'll kill all of you. Go ahead, ask him. He shot first. That's all? Hey. So what's the word here? What? What's the word? What happened? Huh? It was supposed to be a simple job, right? It still is. Ow! Get the fuck off me, man. I did what I needed to. Really? Did what you fucking need to? Why did you shoot him? You tell me why! God. Is he awake? No. Still out from the trauma. I hope he doesn't get gangrene. How quickly does that happen? Oh, we got time. He'll be just fine, OK? We got a couple of hours. You'll be just fine, Geoff, OK? He's breathing. He's fine. The buyer, he'll be here soon. He'll be just fucking fine. But you on the other hand. What the fuck? I'm the only one who did my job right! Screw all of you! Did anyone see any cops show up, huh? Any fucking pigs show up? No! Thank you! I'm the only one who stopped them from hitting the alarm or fighting back. Damn shit is insured. Should have just let us take it. You enjoyed shooting them. I'm sorry. Can a guy help it if he enjoys his work? Wasn't necessary. Who the fuck are you to tell me, huh? Or you? We're doing our job. So am I. I'll show you how to do a job. Hey, hey, hey! Ho! Ho! You both sit down. OK? OK. Now, I mean, I'm just asking, OK? I'm just fucking asking here. Can we not quit this bullshit for about two fucking hours until the buyer shows up? I mean, two hours. Come on! Come on, agreed? Sure. OK then, agreed? Yeah. Fine. Good. That's fine. Good. We good? All right, lads. Let's drink to it. Wait a minute, Alex. Isn't that my whiskey? You can buy more. Just wait a few hours. OK. Cheers. There you go. Cheers. Mmm. OK. You ain't drinking with us? I'm not thirsty. You know what? Actually, I think I'll just have some of his. Yeah, well, he's a little too old for you, don't you think? Don't be gross. Thank you. They never put enough salt in these damn things. Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Jeez. You, uh, you want a little bit of fries to go with that ketchup there, Geoff? That's the key. Hey, hey guys check this out. After this job, you know what to do with my money? Gonna buy me a restaurant, serve nothing but french fries and greasy shit. What about you, old man? You carrying a piece? Nope. Why? You know, you might need one in case the heat shows up. I drive. I don't need one. Whatever you say, tough guy. Man, what you doing, man? Put that away. What? I like to personalize my wardrobe. Are you fucking serious, man? Put that shit away, man. Heads up. She's back. Jesus. That hat. Just what in the hell do you call that? You wouldn't understand. How was it in there? Quiet, not many customers, some pretty settings. Well, not as pretty as the shipment of diamonds arriving tomorrow. Guards? Two. Armed? Both of them. You know, between his accent and hers, it's going to be real easy for any witnesses to identify them in a lineup. Shut up. It's fine. They don't have to talk anyways, and he's going to be in the car the whole time. I don't trust this. Yeah? Well, I trust them. So they're staying. You can leave. No one's making you do this. And if you don't need the money, just walk away. Fuck. It's cool. We're in. We're out. Five minutes max. That's right, baby. Five minutes. Hey, five minutes of hell. But after that, years of comfort. Well, and french fries. You're not invited to my restaurant. Fuck you and your shitty ass restaurant. I don't wanna, Killian, man. Killian! What? Ow! Fuck! Fuck! Oh! Oh, god. Oh. Come on, Trent. No, let go! What did you do, boy? Nothing! Oh God, my head is fucking killing me. What happened? Come on. Help me up. Oh, fuck. Get my arm. Killian! What? Help me, bro. Dude, you're going to die. Just fuck off over there. It fucking hurts. It's OK. Hang in there. We'll see, We'll see if Lisa can get you anything. Lisa? Lisa! Where are the goddamn diamonds? Lisa! Where are the goddamn diamonds? Where? Anything? Maybe your girl took them. Where the fuck is Alex? They gone? God damn it! They sabotaged the safe. What do you think happened? Is obvious. Drink was spiked. Motherfucker, how could he have done that? We're all here. Hey, I'm not going there just yet. He had help. Who? Who's not here? That little bitch. Hey! Don't go there yet. We don't know what happened. Don't go there. We know enough. No, we don't. We don't know what happened. Well, open your damn eyes Trent. We were drugged. The diamonds are gone. They're gone! You might be fucking that skinny bitch-- Let him go. Now! Just be careful what you say about my daughter. We need to get those diamonds back. OK. OK. I've got a plan. Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, this is your stop. You get off here. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Good girl, come on. Come on, girl. Come on. Where are you going? Good girl. Excuse me, you can untie me. Hey, asshole. You can wait for me. Give me a hand. Oh, ho-ho, nice. Yup, they're my babies. They're going to work just fine. What if they took road and not trail? Don't matter. Willow's going to take them on the trail. The direct route gets them off the mountain faster. You only have two of these? Yeah, mine and Lisa's. Still think she's in on it. I don't care what you think. Just bring her back. Bring her back and the diamonds unharmed. You understand me? Alex too? No! Him you fucking kill! You kill him hard! You kill him sadistically! And then, you bring him back dead. OK, you bring his corpse right here. I want to stand on it. I want to spit on it! I want to take out his fucking eyes and put them in a goddamn gumball machine. And then what's left, maybe we can throw him to the dogs. Right. Would be easier with guns. Putting stuff in that safe was a dumb idea. I don't want to argue with you right now, OK? Just go get us our diamonds. We agreed? I'm sure you've used one of these before. Once or twice. For you. Any weapons in there for me? Sure we have. It's for you. You've got to be shitting me. Channel one. Why don't you come with us? Can't do that. More important things in that safe than just the diamonds. But you all? You go get him. Go get him! Can you please take this off? No. Why did you help me back there? What? Back at the cabin, why did you help me? When I saw what you were doing, I knew what was up. I'm not an idiot. You could have warned them. I thought about it. It'd be the easy thing to do. Besides, if I let you use those pills, it might have killed them. But I saw a chance to get out, to escape what's coming, and I took it. I've seen how this plays out, and it's never good. Why did you do it? Wanted all the money for yourself, is that it? We all have debts. People will come looking for those diamonds. You know that, right? Please just take this fucking thing off. No. You're such a pain in the ass. Geoff, you alive? Yeah. Still kicking, boss. That's good, man. That's real good. So, hey, listen. You want to help me crack open this safe? Yeah, no problem. I'm on it. So, where are you leading us? A mate of mine. A meeting. You have a friend? He's got a car? Can he drive us far away from here? For me, not you. But I helped you. Yeah, and I could have left your ass back there. Yeah, and I could have told my father what you were doing. He would have killed your sorry ass, so maybe be a bit nicer to me, yeah? Trent is your father? Yeah. So why does he get you involved in something as dangerous as this? Oh, I know. I told him not to do this, but he said he was doing it for me. Why? I fucked up, got into some trouble. Wait, stop! You're under arrest. Hands behind your back. There was nothing I could do. I was doomed. So daddy decided to do this job to take care of me. Glad I'm not a parent. Goddamn it. Geoff. Yeah? Hey man, you're going to come over here and give me a hand or what? Yeah. I'm on it boss. I got it, baby. That does it. Come here. Take it easy. You're OK. You're OK. Well, I'll tell you what you can do for me. You can tell me exactly what happened. Can you do that? Come on. Come on, Willow. Let's go. We need to move. You don't have to be so rough with her. Willow's a good horse. Is she yours? Yeah. My dad got her for me when she was just a filly. I haven't spent as much time with her as I should. Well, if she's yours, why don't you take care of her? Well, Willow, it's time we let you go girl. What? Why? They'll follow her tracks, and we'll go this way. Come on. Let's go. They're not going to hurt her. They're after us, the diamonds, not the horse. Lisa, we got to go. Hey. Hey, wait up! Oh! Jesus, boy. Why'd you scare us like that for? Nearly had me a heart attack. You twats almost shot me. Fella, you talk funny. wait, did my shot go past you? I'm terribly sorry. I do apologize. I was trying to get me a deer. Well, you missed. I know. I guess I'm just a shitty shot. Yeah, you sure are. Now, son, I am sorry about what happened. I didn't mean you no harm. Yeah, have a drink with us. What sort of rifle is that? .308? This? .223. It's nice. Bag a lot of deer with this one. Whoa. Hello, ma'am. Lady, are you OK? Is there something funny going on? Funny? No, no. It's fine. It's cool. We're-- everything is fine. Yeah, I like to do more than just hunt deer in the woods. You lads know what I mean. Woo! Yeah, we do. Tell me, have you seen any other hunters or people here? No. You're the first people we dun seen in what? Two days? And you know, you really should have one of these colored vests on. Look at the trouble you already dun caused today. Like mom always said, safety first. Wait! Where's he going? We got to help Earl. No, don't take it out. You'll make it worse. Well then, what do we do? Go get them. I will. You don't have to do this, Hayden. Just walk away. Double-crossing bastard. I stood up for you. Come on. Let's go. Help. What did this have to happen? Earl never hurt nobody. Ugh. Don't you guys believe in ice? Shit's warm. Who are you people? You need to stop playing around! Who's playing? I'm thirsty. We don't have time for this. I said, who are you people? Time to go. Hey, relax. Don't sweat it. They're on foot. We'll catch up. And that was it, man. That's how it went down. Fucking bloodbath after that. So, you're telling me that Killian shot the guard because he was sending a text? Just trying to tell his wife that he loved her. Goddamn. Goddamn it! OK, what's the status? Guys? Is it done? Excuse me, sweetheart. Not yet, but I got myself a rifle now. What do you mean not yet? What's going on? Don't worry about it. Did you see them? Yeah, both of them. They were working together. Did they have our stuff? Looks like it. By the way, Hayden won't be helping us anymore, like ever. Is Lisa OK? She's fine. Well, hurry up. We don't have long until our visitor shows up. We're on it. Out. You know, you're not supposed to hurt the boss's daughter, right? She stole from us. I make no promises. What is it? You hear that? They're coming. Can we hide? Take this. Take this. Take this. I got a plan. You have to trust me. Come on. What's up, guys? You've got a lot of nerve. Where's the diamonds? Don't panic. They're right here, darling. Stealing from your friends isn't very nice. What can I say? I need them more than you do. I wouldn't have expected this from you. Oh, yeah? Why is that? I never said I was a good guy. Shoot them! Not the machines! You're mine! When you shoot, you shoot people. And I'll take that. Cheers, very much. Damn! Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Is it ruined? She shot out the damn tire. Strange. She could have killed us. Yeah, well, that was her mistake. Good, I'll be back. Where are you going? To get my arrows. Fix ATV. Fix it? How? You figure it out. You got to be kidding me. Fuck! Guys, this is Trent. Somebody answer me. Not yet. What's going on? I mean, where are you? Soon. Out. I'm going to have to take this one. Hurry up. Zarina, damn it. Oh, Jesus Christ. You ain't dead yet? Easy now. You got to just relax and breathe. OK? Listen, Lisa's medical bag's still here. Are you OK with taking something for the pain? Oh, yes. God, yes please. OK Hold on. Hey. Why did she do it, man? Lisa. Why did she do it? There you go. Good. Well, she seems to be making bad choices all the time her whole life, to be honest. I made all this right here. I mean, she's a doctor. Well, she was a doctor, but it's hard to be in the medical business when you're the one that's on all the drugs. If you know want I mean. You should start feeling better real soon. Hey, man. Hey, hey, hey. What about you, man? What are you going to do when you see her again? Keep an eye on this guy. What do you think? I think it needs percussion. That's what all drummers say. You're late. Yeah. There was a delay. Who's your friend? Nobody. Well all still good? You got the stones? Yeah. Nice. Very nice. It's a lot more in here than we talked about. You can pay me the rest later. Right now, I need you to give me a ride. Excuse me? We good? Oh, yeah, we're, we're great. Are you fucking kidding me? No. I guess this breaks the band on. A good drummer is hard to find. It's a shame. We had a deal. Did we? But my boy. Look, don't play that card with me, OK. I feel bad about your kid. It's very sad about your boy. Your boy? Oh, he didn't tell you? His son's in the hospital. He needs a kidney transplant or something. Look, what are the odds he was going to make it anyway? About one in 50. I need that money. And I got bills to pay too, pal. One day you'll understand. Drop it. Oh. That's a ballsy move, sweetie. Are you sure you can do it? Because I will drop your friend faster than you can blink. Who said he was my friend? That's cold, baby. But I like it. It's kind of sexy. So you think you have the stones to pull the trigger? You can kill me right here, right now. Do it. Shoot this wanker. I didn't think so. It's in the eyes. I could tell. But I don't have a problem. Fuck. Can't you shoot? Fucking scope. Boothe! Aha-ha-ha. I'll get her. You get him. Copy that. You should of just given me the diamonds. Why don't you just fuck off and die, Boothe? I'm working on it. Ah! I don't suppose you can find it in your heart to call me an ambulance. It's not looking good mate. Yeah. Sorry. I think you got about a 1 in 50 chance of survival. Yeah. Good luck with your kid. Bollocks. Well, all right then. Does anybody copy. This is Trent. Killian? Anybody? Do you copy? Come on now. She OK? Tell me you didn't her. She's fine. OK. Lisa. Hey. Lisa. Hey. There you go. Oh, no. No. We shouldn't be here. That's OK. We shouldn't be here. You're with me now. Tell me about the others. It's just us. What about Alex? I got diamonds. Deal still good. OK. OK. Take this thing around back, and meet me inside. Let me go. You're OK. Let me go. You're OK. OK. We can't be here. You'll be just fine here. Come on, dad. Let's get out of here. I keep telling you, we're fine here. We can't be here, dad. We're fine here! Dad, please! We're fine! Please listen to me! Hey! Dad, I have got to tell you-- Will you stop! Goddamn it just, just stop for once. Would you just-- hey, you know what Lisa? I'm happy you ain't hurt, I really am. But sometimes you are a fucking nightmare to deal with. You always have me. And so I'm going to ask you again, just for once, would you do what I say. Just for once, and then when the buyer shows up, all this will-- it's done. Now, tell me what happened to Alex. Did he hurt you? No. Not as much as she did. What? If she ran from us, why she run? It's not like that, OK? I know why Alex did this. It's not what you think. Lisa, I don't care why Alex did this, OK? He stole from us, all of us. And he's going to have to pay. He's not a bad guy. I am. If we're all here when the buyer shows, we're all going to jail. That's absolute nonsense because I made sure no one knew about this place. No one knows we're here. Dad, I'm telling the truth. The cops already know. Why? Would you say that? Hey, Hey. Hey. Come here. Wait, stop! You're under arrest. Hands behind your back. You're under arrest. Give me a fucking name! So, yeah. Whoever stays to do the deal is going away for a long time. You rat! You led them to us! It's OK. Wait. Jesus, wait. Don't. Don't. I'm only going to ask you one time, Lisa. It's just, I need to know if this is true. Lisa. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. You didn't know. You didn't know what else to do so you sold us all down the river. We had to pay for your punishment. I feel bad about it. You feel bad? Yeah. Yeah, you feel bad? Yeah. Is that because you're a fucking junkie they can't control herself? I did all this for you. All of this is for you. You fuck junkie. You never really could help yourself, could you? Could you? You know I am this way because of you. Because of you, dad! Mom left! She's gone. You've done everything you could to push me away, too. And it don't matter anymore, daddy, because the cops are on the way. Don't you understand? The cops are on the way. We've got to get out. Shut up! Shut up! There. You stay strong. You're going to be fine. Hold still. I'm sorry. Oh, are you, Alex? I mean, are you really, truly sorry because you, you did all of us. You did. She fucking hated you. You know that, right? OK. Fuck you. Sorry about that, man. Move. Move the fuck over. Shut the door. Listen, all right. You behave yourself, and I take you to hospital. Deal? Deal. We friends now? I guess so. Best friends? Best friends hit pretty hard. You fucking shot me, man. Just get out of here. What the hell? Move. What is this? Where's Trent? You're the buyer? You have the diamonds? Of course I do. Excellent. More importantly-- Yeah, and I'm keeping it. Oi, you still alive? A little bit. Let's get out of here. All right. Doctor, right? Doctors. Hospital. Doctor. Don't fucking move. As we agreed. We good? Have a good day. And anything else I need to know before we go to the doctor? To a lifetime of greasy fries, my friend. Yeah.
