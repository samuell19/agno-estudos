Thank you very much, Mr.... Oh, no, don't thank me. I happened to pick up after your wife called. I'm right behind you. All right, I got to tell you something. You've got a lot of potential with this basement, all right? Ever thought of rewiring it? You should check out outlets while I'm finishing up, because you could have an entertainment system. Big-screen TV's.I watch a lot of TV in my work. Besides, the distraction would be a killer. Oh, that's too bad. Well, would you mind if I ask what it is you do? I write jingles, music for commercials. That's great. Very cool. Anything I might recognize? Know the hair dryer commercial that's a take-off on James Bond? With the animation and the Shana-na thing? Yeah, where the villain gets blown away, right? [CHUCKLES]That's some of your work, huh? You're good. You're very good. I know, thank you. You have an impressive husband, Mrs. Rudman. Who's that?

I gotta get moving here. You don't play the piano by any chance, do you? Piano? I was just wondering. As a matter of fact, I used to play. I can still fool around. The piano? I'm going to get killed. I'm a dead man. Let's see. [CHUCKLES] Whoa! It works!That's great. Could I steel you for one more minute? Um... Just something in the music room. I really should be going.It won't take long. Come on.

Well, okay, it was just worth a shot. Ah, before you go. Can I ask you one more question? Could you sit down a minute? Sit down? Yeah, just sit down Just relax. Right. Okay. Now I know this is gonna seem strange but I'll explain in a minute. If you, as an electrician, wanted to commit the perfect murder, how would you do it? The perfect murder?Yeah, you know No trail, no clue. Make it look like an accident. Oh, well... Why would I wanna commit a perfect murder? Oh, just leave that aside.That's a very strange question. I don't know if I can leave it aside. Leave that aside! You know you see, I'm writing a musical. And I have two things stopping me now. One is that damn drum machine. And the other is this character who is plotting to commit the perfect murder. Only, I can't think what it is. So you thought that maybe I could, uh Yeah, well, I thought maybe there was some electrical device or gimmick that, you know, that fooling around on the job something might've came up. Oh, yeah, well, let's see. I don't know. If I ever gonna kill somebody and make it look like an accident, I would probably... Stick their fingers in a socket to electrocute them. Give them a shock in the bath while they're trying to fix something. That happens a lot. It does?Oh, yes. Well, thank you. That sounds very helpful. I don't know what I did, but I'm glad I was of service. Ah, you're the first person I ever met who was writing a musical. I think I better be going. I don't know what Mrs. Rudman's doing, but I'm sorry I couldn't help with the piano. Don't worry. Don't apologize. It was nice of you to look at it. You'll send us the bill?Bill? The bill. You'll mail us the bill? Oh, yeah. The bill, yeah. I'll put that right in the mail. Probably won't charge you for the piano, though. That was kind of fun.Yeah, it was, wasn't it? Yeah. You don'tThank you. Mrs. Rudman won't be very happy if I just leave, you know. Mrs. Rudman will be fine with that. All right, well, then give her my best. I will. Tell her that if she has anymore problems, she can just let me know. Bye, bye.All right. Bye. [SIGHS] She's having an affair. Who is?The wife. Three afternoons a week. When the husband goes to his health club, she drives off to God knows where, for an hour or two of perfectly torrid love-making. Judging from the look in her eye when she returns. Really? Well, I pity the wife when Rudman finds out. She's likely to end up like Gertie. Your wife?Yes. What? No, no, no. My terrier. Gertie enjoyed an occasional, how shall I say, poop on the Rudman's lawn. I discouraged it, of course, but what can you do? Yeah. One evening, Rudman approaches me here in this driveway. He doesn't say a word about Gertie. He tells me he's writing a musical, and he's got a problem. Since I read mysteries, would I know a discreet way to bump off a character? Wanting to be helpful, I suggest the simplest method I know. Run the victim down with an automobile, and claim it was an accident. He thanks me, very appreciative, and all that. Next day, I come home and find Gertie dead in the road. And guess who's claiming it's an accident? I couldn't prove a thing. Excuse me. I've got to take a run for the loo. [BLOWS] [PANTS] [♪♪♪] [CLANKS] [♪♪♪] Looking for me? Hi. You're okay. What are you doing here? I came to protect you. What's the gun for?Self-defense. You have a bat. Ah, I have a bat. I don't understand. Why do you think I would want to hurt you? Don't play dumb with me, York. I know your little scheme. What scheme? It's Rio. Rio, sun, beaches, good food, cheap wine. Yeah, and who's gonna pay for that trip to Rio, huh? No, he's wrong, whatever he said. You didn't just tell him how to kill me and make it look like an accident? Ah! All right. Look, he asked me right? He didn't. He asked the electrician. Who's the electrician?I'm the electrician. Well, I was the electrician.You are the electrician? I had to tell him something. You said he was gonna kill me! So Ron was right. That's why you came back. For the money.What? What money? This money. [CHUCKLES] Finally we meet. Actually, we met a little earlier. I know. The electrician. The boy from Ipanema. Step back, please. Nancy didn't believe me until I showed her this. What?You thought it was simple. Finding a rich emotionally unstable woman. Hey!Make her fall in love with you. Stealing her checks, you deplete her husband's bank account signing his name. But then you take her and leave the country, so as not to arouse suspicion. Then when you get to Rio, you dump her, taking the money. You're crazy.Watch who you're calling crazy. Look that's not even my bag! All right, York, you have a bag that's not yours? Okay, I can explain it. I can explain it all to you.Shoot. Now?No, wait for my signal, dear. That sounded like a signal to me. Let your friend speak.He's not my friend. Are you, York?Actually, I am your friend. But at this particular moment, I am a little sorry that we met. Would you give the signal already? I can't believe this. You'd really murder me. With pleasure. You lied to me. No, no, I didn't lie. I don't think anyone's contemplating murder, Mr. Daley. "Officer, the intruder was going through my wife's jewels. "So we surprised him. "He tried to attack us, we fired, and... we killed him." That's show business. I see, you got the finale to your musical. Now what?Now you run. I run? I run, so that you can shoot me in the back. Oh, something like that. No. Run, Mr. Daley!Yeah, run! Wait a minute. Why does he have to run? The police will check if the bullet wound was made while the perpetrator was escaping. It's clever, but I won't move. Let's just kill him, and position his body, make it look like an accident. You sound pretty blood-thirsty, Nancy. Oh, I am. I mean to think I ever loved you. You never told me you loved him. I told you I was having an affair. What did you think that meant? Swapping stories about lost luggage? You liked hearing about my work. NANCY: Could we just kill him? Come on, Ron. RON: I'll kill him when I'm ready. What's it going to take to make you ready? Want me to tell you how much I loved him? RON: Shut up, Nancy. How good he was in bed?Run! I loved her.Shut up. You want us to do it in front of you, so you can see how much I enjoy it. Shut up, Nancy!My eyes roll back in my head and little beads of sweat on my upper lip. Run! And I would shout things. Things like, don't stop York! Run!I'm coming! I'm coming! Run!I'm coming! Run! Don't stop! [GRUNTS] [GUNSHOT] [SIGHS] I didn't lie about the bag.

They're gonna get you. The security or the cops or my friends.Oh, friends like Rusty? COLE: Ooh! Okay, well, I'm sorry about that. It was either me or you and I chose me. Okay, I know you're not the kind of guy who would do that. You're not the kind of guy who would run through that defense, through that crowded secondary in a clutch game. You don't think I could pull a switch on the Iceman? Rusty tell you why I did that?Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, I did it. But Ice owed me, man! I was like the son he never knew, that he wanted to adopt.
