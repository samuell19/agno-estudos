I'm not like you. - Honey, some of these people have driven cross country to be here. And millions more are waiting in front of their televisions to see us. - Yeah, us. Me and you. The Judds. Not the Judd. I'm not ready. - Baby, you are ready. You've never been more ready. (emotional music) - Not ready to die. - I'm scared too, baby. I don't know what's gonna happen anymore than you.

Back then, everyone knew her as Diana Ellen, the first child of Polly and Glen Judd. - Is that all you got? - Get out of my room! Mama? Margaret stole all my barrettes again. - Did not! - Did too, big liar. You get in 'em again, I'm gonna staple your hair to the sides of your head. - You two, cut it out! - [Mark] She started it! - Mama, it's the biggest night of my life and my dress doesn't fit. - If I were you, I'd worry about my teeth, metal mouth. - I hope Prince Charming doesn't have anything magnetic on him. - How can you read this crud? I don't love him any more, but I don't love him any less. - It's romance, Brian, not that you know anything about it. - My heart beat so loud I was afraid he might ascertain my true desire. - My true desire? Maybe you better stick to Seventeen Magazine. Remember to sit up straight. - Can I wear lipstick? - All right. I wanna get a picture of you for our album. - You'd think she was going out with Elvis instead of some military school geek. - He's not a geek, Brian. Linda said he's the best looking boy at Fork Union Military Academy, and you know what else? He drives a brand new Imperial with fins. - Fins? If she were my daughter, I wouldn't even let him in the door. - Oh, phooey. He comes from an excellent family. - Oh, you know what else, Mama? They have a maid, too. - Sounds like they know how to waste money, if you ask me. He's here. - He's here? - Don't forget your curfew, now. - Yes, sir. - Oh, zits. His face looks like a pepperoni pizza, Di. (kids giggling) - Bri, get out! - Act like a lady, and if you don't know which fork to use, watch him. - Yeah, watch him. (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Irish linen, Parisian china. - You wanna dance? (smooth jazz music) Not this one, bud. Linda lied when she said you were pretty. You're beautiful. (audience applauds) - Song's over. - Well then why am I still hearing music? - You know, Teen Beat says that's the number one line used this year? Second one being, "Is when they made the alphabet, "they should have put U and I together." I never knew these were so good. - You never had shrimp before? - Mm-mm, no. Only fish my family eats is salmon patties. They're not so bad if you put ketchup on 'em. - You know by the end of the night, this here's gonna be our song. - I'm 14 stinkin' years old, all right? He's not like any of the other boys in Ashland. He knows how to cha-cha, and he's the diving champion at the club. - What club? - Bellefonte Country Club. He taught me how to do the twist. - Oh, well. - And you know what else? He didn't even say anything about my braces. - Well, I'm impressed. (both chuckle) - It was so dreamy, Mama. I wish you and Daddy would go out sometimes. You know, like on a date, or just go out to dinner or something. You never do anything. - He has to close out the service station. - Yeah, but Mama, he doesn't even ever take you out for your birthday, or even buys you any birthday presents. - He's never been much for shopping. - I've never even seen him kiss you. - Well, you know marriage isn't always a bed of roses, especially when you get married at 15, like I did. But, your life is gonna be different when you get married. - I wanna travel, and see things. I wanna see everything that's out there, Mama. I wanna meet the most interesting people. I just want my life to be different. - Well, you make it different. It's all up to you, Diana. Lord knows you've got the imagination. (both giggle) - Who are you? What do you want? Get away from her! Get away I tell you, I'm warning you! (man screaming) - Michael. I'm not like your college girls. - I think I know what kind of girl you are by now. - You have to go back to college in one week. You wanna waste it pickin' on this same ol' thing? - Well, I'm not gonna wait around forever while you try and decide. - Well, what do you want from me, Michael? - Marry me? - I'm not even out of high school! - When you graduate, then. - Michael, I don't love you. - Well, I love you. I love you enough for both of us. You are mine, Diana. You just don't know it yet. - I don't belong to anybody. (door slams) Hi. - Hey. Michael? - Mm-hmm. - You know, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, he could have any girl in Ashland and he's in love with you. - A man of impeccable taste. - Even the Johnstone sisters. What's he got that I don't have? Well, okay, besides dark wavy hair, a big ol' car, and a rich daddy. - Brian. - Can he match this body? - Ooh, big muscles. - Shut up. - What's that bump? - Excuse me? - No, seriously. - What? - See this? - What? - Right there. (birds chirping) Hi. - Dr. Franz wants us to take Brian into Columbus for tests tonight. - Why, what's wrong? - Well, he's afraid that it might be cancer. - Cancer? - Mm-hmm, I'm gonna need you to get the kids ready for their first day of school tomorrow. Mark's gonna want his peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and Margaret's gonna want to wear her blue dress, so you be sure it's pressed, okay? - I won't let you down, Mama. - I know you won't, honey.

(emotional music) - What do they do now? - Well, I have to go to the hospital, and get chemotherapy and then radiation treatments. - Brian, go upstairs and rest. - Is his hair gonna fall out? - I don't know. - Does it hurt? - I don't know. - [Diana] Well, is he gonna be okay? - I don't know, Diana, so stop asking. I am tired. I've gotta iron your daddy's shirts. (emotional music) - Do you know how much I esteem oatmeal cookies? - I'm not hungry. - Is your tummy still bothering you? - No. - Oh. You dropped four grades. - As to Bs, big deal. - You got a C in algebra, stop right there. Brian, go inside. You went from a 3.5 to a 3.0 in one semester. Do you think any decent college will take you with grades like this? - Why did you just make Brian leave? - 3.0, what kind of a future are you gonna have without an education? - You're afraid to talk about the future in front of him, aren't you? - We're not discussing Brian, we're discussing you. - He's dying, Mama. You can't even own up to it. All you care about is my grades? - Brian's future is in God's hands. But yours is still in mine. (birds chirping) - For wither thou goest, I will go. And where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and they God, my God. Who was this Naomi that could inspire such devotion? She was no great prophetess or saintly heroine. She was just an ordinary, hard-working housewife. But one faithful, loving daughter-in-law vowed to follow her. To love, and support her, and God, seeing this bond of pure love between the two women, led both to a treasure greater than any had ever known.

What am I gonna do? I've never had a job before. I get $1.50 allowance a week. I can't even drive. - Well, maybe Mom and Dad will raise your allowance? - I haven't even graduated yet. - So what, me neither. - But you're not gonna be a mother. - Probably not a father, either. - Don't you say that! - But I'm gonna be an uncle soon. If it's a boy, you can call him Brian. And if it's a girl, you can give her up for adoption, I guess. - Brian! - I'm sorry, that was a stupid thing to say. You can call her Briana. Briwina?

All our preparations, our dreams? - I'm sorry, Mama. - Oh, Lord have mercy. Your life was gonna be special, it was gonna be different. - I know, but what can I do? - Well, what do you think you do? You marry him. - No Mama, I can't do that. - You are the last girl in town I would've expected this from. I must've failed you somewhere. But you have made your bed, now you have to lie in it. I told your father. (crickets chirping) - You love him? - Yeah. - Then I guess you'll marry him. - Yeah. (bells tolling) - For you. That's my daddy, Ogden. He once told me there's only two things you can give your kids. Looks, and wings. I hope I've given you both. - Thank you, Daddy. - Well, don't you look all grown up? I guess it's that time. - I feel like the sacrificial lamb. - You sure aren't the sacrificial virgin. - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show just cause why these two should not be so joined, let him now speak, or forever after hold his peace. Do you, Diana Ellen Judd, take Michael Ciminella to be your lawful wedded husband? For rich or for poor, in sickness and health, 'til death do you part? - I do. - Do you, Michael Ciminella, take Diana Ellen Judd to be your lawful wedded wife, for rich or for poor, sickness and in health, 'til death do you part? - I do. - I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (birds chirping) - What'd he say? - I have to have a C-section. - They gotta cut you? - I wanna go by my house. - Di, you keep calling it your house. It's not your house anymore, you live with us now. - Well, I can forget for a moment, Michael. - Don't start with me, okay? - Look, your parents have been wonderful, but it is their house. I don't have a home anymore. - Right, we're gonna have our own place once I go back to school. Student housing up in Lexington isn't that bad, either. We'll probably get a two bedroom place since we'll have a baby. - I wanna see how Brian's doin'. - It'll take forever, just call him, Di. - Michael, please! I wanna ask my mama about the C-section. - All right, fine. (Diana knocking) - Hello! - [Michael] I don't think they're home, hon. - Mama! Brian? - Look hon, they probably took him up to Columbus for his chemotherapy. (Diana knocking) - Hello! - Di, they're not home. - Uh-huh. - Di, come on, let's go. - Let me in. - Come on, come on, let's go. - Please let me in! - Diana, they are not home. Now, come on! - Please let me in, please. I wanna go back to my room. I wanna go back home. I want my bed, I want my family. - Diana, we are gonna have a house of our own, and a family of our own. (emotional music) (baby crying) (dramatic music) - It's a girl? - Well, Penny Webb's folks were out in the front yard taking pictures of her in her cap and gown. And they're gonna have a big party tonight. - You know you got an A on your term paper? Her tutor said it was the best one she ever read. - You wrote a term paper? - Yeah, havin' a baby. Things every teen mother should know. - Slumber party etiquette for the expecting, learning how to share your stuffed animals with your kids, and how to say no and really mean it. - Brian. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Hard to imagine my little girl had a baby. - Yep, well I reckon we'll grow up together then, huh? - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mama. - [Announcer] Dr. Edgars to the OR, please. Dr. Edgars to the OR, please. - You okay? - Thank you. (baby fussing) Oh, hi. Oh, look at her. Isn't she the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? - Yeah, well she comes from a long line of beautiful women. (baby crying) - She's got a set of lungs. - Di, I'm gonna go get some coffee, okay? (baby fussing) - Looks like it's just you and me, little partner. (baby crying) Shh. I promise you I'll always take care of you. - Di, we don't have room for all this stuff in the apartment. - [Diana] Well, you leave some of your junk, I'll leave mine. - Will you two stop your bickering? - Thanks, Mama. - It's a long way to Lexington. You're off to college after all, just not like we planned. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye. - Bye. - Take care of my girls. - Yes, sir. Brian. - Come back and see Nana before you get all grown up. (baby crying) (pleasant music) (cup clatters) - Christina. (phone ringing) Hello. Michael, I'm a little busy right now. Can't you come get it? Okay. (phone ringing) What now, Michael? Oh, sorry Mama. Okay, I'll be there. (people chattering) (TV blaring) - [Woman] No, what are you doing, no! - Can you take her please? - What's the matter? What, what's the matter with Mommy, huh? I'll be right back, Diana! Look Di, I don't know what you think was goin' on, but we were just talking. - I don't give a damn right now, Michael. I need the car for a few days, and I need you to take care of Christina. - Brian? Oh baby, I'm... (emotional music) - Hi. - Hey. What are you doin' here? I must be pretty bad, huh? - No, I just thought that if I was here then Mom and Dad could rest a bit. Talked 'em into going out to get something to eat. - Good. They haven't left this room for weeks. (Brian gasps) - Brian. Brian, what do you need? Can I get you something? - How about a beer? - A beer? You don't drink. - Well, I figure I better start before it's too late. (bell ringing) - Where is that nurse? - She gave me a shot about an hour ago. - Well, I don't think it's workin'. You know if I were your nurse, you wouldn't hurt. - I know. No, you were always bringing home wounded creatures. Stray cats, birds, that mangy mutt. - Remember when you shot Aunt Sora's rooster with your slingshot? - You told Daddy you did it so I wouldn't get a lickin'. You were always takin' care of me. - [Diana] Yeah. - It's weird. I mean, we're talkin' about our childhood like it was ancient history or something. - Yeah, seems like another life. - I wanna be at home. - I know. - Get me outta here. Just take me home, please.

She held a dozen different clerical and service jobs, but no matter how hard she worked, we were always hard up.

Truth's worse. - I told her you never do anything but work, cook, clean, and shop. - Well she can certainly relate to that. But I have a date tonight. - With who? - Oh, just a new guy that moved in down the canal. - The one that looks like Jim Orson? - Yes, I ran into him in the bookstore and he asked me to go to The Troubadour. - Oh, he's that cute and he reads? - And paints, and cooks. - Well, what about my science project?

Just think, you're gonna have a new river to swim in, and all kinds of neat new things to explore. - I saw Mr. Shanks eat a carrot today. - Hot news flash in Camp Wig. I can see the headlines now. Mr. Shanks eats a carrot! - Well, he doesn't have any teeth. - Maybe later, we could go watch the corn grow. - I like it here lots better. She does, too, she just doesn't wanna say so. - Can I go down to Donny's? - Donny is 17, and it's Saturday night. He's probably at that pool hall. - If we had a phone, I could call. - We have to make some sacrifices if I'm gonna stay in college, honey. - What am I supposed to do now? - I know. (crickets chirping) (guitar twanging) It was your daddy's. - Here, let me. (gentle guitar music) - [Class] Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands. One nation... (engine rumbling) - Yeehaw! (people chattering) - [Dwight] I swear it on my pappy's grave, I'd beat him seven out of 10 games. - You're so full of bull, Dwight. - Donny, you promised you'd teach me how to play pool. - Him, he can't teach you nothin'. - Five bucks says she can beat ya. - You're on. (country music) - Break. (pool balls clatter) - Your mama know you're not in school? - No ma'am. - She's gonna if you don't hightail it back there on the double, young man. You see this little girl? You take a good look at her. You find her back in here again, you send her packing. We understand each other? - Let go! - Serves you right. - Sucker! - [Diana] Wait 'til I get you home. - I don't wanna go home. - You are goin' home if I gotta tie you to the bumper of that car and drag you. - Oh I'm really scared. - Don't you dare, Christina, get me, ow! (Christina laughing) Open the door, Christina. Open the door. - Nope. - Open that door right now, do you hear me? Open the door! (people chattering) (pleasant music) - Mighty fine and a great big happy to you, buckaroos. - Hi. - Hi. - I hung the towels on the porch, but they won't dry. - Why are you doing Christina's chores? - 'Cause she said she's put my head in the wringer if I didn't, and she made me burn all the garbage, too. - Did you do any of your chores? - All she ever does is play that stupid guitar. - It's not stupid! - [Diana] Stop it right now. - And she took that brand new jar of peanut butter you brought back from the store and traded it in for candy. - You what? - Big tattletale. - I oughta slap you silly. - I was sick of peanut butter. - Did you soak the beans like I asked, or bring in the coal? - Must've slipped my mind. - Yesterday you forgot your homework. The day before, you left your history book at school. - Who cares about history? I'd rather write my own. - First you need to learn how to write. - Well, if my schoolbooks are an example, I guess just any idiot can do it. - Here, I got these for you. - Thank you. Can I read before I set the table? - Your sister's gonna set the table for you tonight. I got these for you. - I never heard of Hazel & Alice. - They're a couple of women singers. You don't hear that very often. Can't believe I work all day to come home to this.

Your grades stink, you've ditched five days of school this semester, and you have not done a chore around here in a week. - That's not true. - Oh really? - I ditched seven days of school. (gentle guitar music) - You think being a liar is cute? I'm not amused, do you hear me? Look at me, I am struggling against all odds to improve myself. If you wanna be anything in life, you have got to get an education. - Sorry, my books have lost their text appeal. - That does it. - Give it back! - Not on your life. - Why'd you bring us here anyway? I hate it! - I'm trying to teach you something. - Well I'm tired of being cold, and living on soup beans and cornbread. I'm tired of other kids laughing at my clothes. I'm sick and tired of being poor! - We have more than most people. - Stop it, okay? Stop pretending it's all some pioneer adventure. - Don't talk to Mama in that tone of voice! - Butt out, buttface. - It's okay, baby. Since you don't wanna do any work around here, and you're not interested in school, what do you intend to do with your life? - Music. It's the only thing in this world I care about. Now you want to take that away, too. - Look, I'm doing the best I can. If you're not happy here, maybe you should go try it with your father. (emotional music) (gentle guitar music) Deer lay in the shady groves, and there are plenty of wild berries. Bluejays flew with their sunbonnets and scolded because they were taking the berries. 'Cause they were taking the berries. Snakes hurried. They crawled away from them, and in the trees, the squirrels woke up and shouted at them.

Thank you. - They think they're gonna be stars. (people laughing) - We could be, you know. - You be careful what you wish for, kid. You just might get it. - Kids look great. - Yeah. - Country life agrees with 'em. Christina still got problems in school? - Hey, stop that. Christina, stop that. It's okay. Problem is they send her home at the end of each day. - Long as she's getting an education. - An education? She's gonna end up in a trailer park with five kids by the time she's 30. - I doubt that. - No, I mean it. She is outta control. Only thing she cares about is music. - So, find a way to use that. - You know, I've been thinking a lot about Brian lately. And I'm thinking about going for a nursing degree, and I found a great school in Marin County. It's near San Francisco, and they are doing real progressive stuff. So I was thinkin' of moving this summer, when the girls are visiting their grandparents. - I thought you said you never wanted to live in the city again. - Well, Marin County's not like LA. - It's not like home, either. - Neither is Camp Wig. There's gotta be someplace on the planet that feels like home. And maybe it's Marin. - Oh, sounds like another movin' truck to me. (both laughing) - Stop it. I wish Daddy didn't have to go fishing this weekend. You know, this might be our last family reunion for a while. - He didn't go fishing. He's left Mom. They're divorcing. (emotional music) - Mama, Margaret told me. - Oh, your daddy. He's got a girlfriend. - What? - Yeah, he's got a girlfriend. She's your age, and she jogs every day. - Mama, I'm so sorry. - I'm gonna want you and Mark to talk to my lawyer, honey. I don't imagine that Margaret could fly back in, do you, to testify? - What do you mean, testify? - On my behalf. - I can't testify against Daddy. - You are not a child any longer. Have I ever asked you for anything in my life? - No, you haven't. You've given everything you had to us kids. But so has Daddy. - Well, well he's with somebody else. I mean, he's happy as a bridegroom. Is that what I deserve? - Mama, you both deserve better. Neither of you have been happy for years. - Well, and that's my fault? - No, I'm not saying it's your fault. - Well, I might've known that you'd disappoint me. - I'm always gonna disappoint you, aren't I, no matter what I do, I'm just gonna always disappoint you. - Is that what this is all about? That I forced you to face up to your mistake? - I was 17. (emotional music) I needed you. (Polly sighs) - Well, now you're grown. I guess you don't. ♪ Flow on ♪ ♪ River of time ♪ ♪ Wash away the pain ♪ ♪ And heal my mind ♪ ♪ Flow on ♪ ♪ River of time ♪ ♪ Carry me away ♪ ♪ And leave it all far behind ♪ - [Ashley] Though sad years would pass before Mama and Mom would heal their breach, Mom's bond with sister and me grew stronger every day.

I can't. - Can't isn't in our vocabulary. You're gonna go out there, and you are gonna sing, and you're gonna be great. (audience applauds) Okay? You're gonna be great.

Aren't you in one of my classes? - I'm a nursing student, but I have been auditing your lectures for the last few weeks. - Switching majors? - Oh Lord, no. I have trouble finding the power button on my stereo. But I heard that you finish up the semester by recording a demo, and my daughter, Wynonna and I, we wanna be your singers. (Ray chuckles) - Well, you've got some chutzpah, miss? - Judd, Naomi. - Where you from, Naomi? - Does my accent give me away? - Little bit. - I'm from Kentucky. - Well, everybody in the class is a musician, or a singer. So they're gonna do their own- - My daughter, she's got something very, very special. So if you could just give us a chance, please? - She says you can sing. - Well, I can. - She's awesome, she's an incredible singer. - I can sing. - All right, let's find out. - Thank you. - Okay? Can you just have a seat over there? - We'll wait right here, okay, thank you, thank you. - Sorry. - [Ray] You know, to do this right, we should record you separately.

It's a stupid name, and a stupid idea. - It's not stupid. Honey, you're gonna get straight As, and you are gonna be popular wherever we go. But this is a chance for your sister to make something of herself. It's the only thing she loves. - Why can't she just sing here? - Because we sing country. It's gotta be Nashville. - Nana says you've lost your mind. - You told her? When? - I called her last night. - Ashley. - That's it. - Okay, anytime. - Ashley! - See you later. (people chattering) - What'd you say to her? - What rock did you find them under? - The one with the goatee, he's a tattoo artist. He said he'd do me for free. - Over my dead body. - He could probably arrange that, too. - Ashley, honey! - Just let her go, Mama. - I need to talk to her. - You're not gonna go back on our deal, are you? - Honey, she's 11 years old. - Goin' on 40. - She doesn't understand. - You promised. - She needs a home. - We've been back and forth across this country a billion times doin' your thing. This is the first time it's ever had anything to do with me. You gave me that guitar, and you told me that I was special and you said that we were gonna travel, and see stuff. You said it was up to me. Did you mean it? - Of course. - Well, we got our tape. You heard what Professor Ray said, he said our harmonies are magical. - Honey, they're only gonna get better the more we work on them. What if we just stay here another year, let Ashley finish junior high- - I've never asked you for anything before. I'm willing to work for it, I'll work hard. Professor Ray told you where we belong. N-A-S-H-V-I-L-L. E. I'm gonna do it, Mama. I'm goin' to Nashville. - You're 16 years old. - It's your dream, too. Nana told me how you used to sing to Uncle Brian. What would he have wanted you to do? We can do this together, Mama. I want you to be there with me. (emotional music) I'm not blind, I know Nana wasn't there for you. Not the way you needed. - You'll stay in school? - Yeah. - Okay, let's go. - You mean it? - Yeah. (pleasant music) - [Michael] Your own father thinks this is crazy. - When did you talk to my father? - When I picked up the girls. He said if Christina really wants this, she will still want it when she's 18. He also said he couldn't believe you'd struggle all those years getting a nursing degree, and then just throw it away. - I'm not throwing it away. I will get a Tennessee license once I'm there. - What about school? Christina barely made it outta junior high, and now she's gotta start over? - I don't care about school. - We have a deal. No school, no music. (Michael sighs) - I heard your tape. You've got talent, I'll give you that. But you know how many people go to Nashville with the same dream? What are you gonna live on? If you really cared about these girls, you would think about that! - Who do you think has cared for these girls for the last nine years? Who has taken care of them while they were sick? Who has put food on the table for them, made sure they had a Christmas tree? - Not my fault I wasn't there. I begged you to stay! - Stop it, just stop screaming! - Maybe I haven't been the best father in the world, but I tell you what, I love these girls. I've got a good job now, and I am settled, and Doris and I want 'em to come live with us for a while. - But we're goin' to Nashville. - No. - All right. You two have to go off and chase this rainbow, fine, but Ashley is gonna stay here with me. - Don't do that. Michael, don't do this. - I'm not doin' it! This is your choice, Diana. - No one ever asked me what I want. I want to stay here, with Dad. - Honey, you really mean that? (emotional music) - Don't drop me! - I'm not gonna wait around forever while you get it together, Di. - Don't threaten me, Michael. - Christina is my daughter, too. - Bye, Ash. - I love you, Mommy. How could I not love you? - I know that, baby. It's not your fault. You know what, I'm gonna get us a new home. I'm gonna get us something real, real nice, and then I'm comin' back for you. You hear me? (emotional music) You take care of her. - Are we doing the right thing, Mama? - I don't know. ♪ Heartaches ♪ ♪ You know my heart aches ♪ ♪ Every time I ♪ ♪ Think of you ♪ ♪ Lonesome ♪ ♪ I'm on my own some ♪ ♪ Yes I could loan some ♪ ♪ Tears to you ♪ (dramatic music) (soothing music)
