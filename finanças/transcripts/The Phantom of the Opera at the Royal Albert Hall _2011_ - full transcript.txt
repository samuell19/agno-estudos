Oh, thank you. Thank you. Gosh, uh, do sit down, for goodness' sake. I might talk for too long. Gosh, when I was a little boy and I was first brought here by my mother when I was five, I think, to a Promenade concert, I think I heard Beethoven's Third Symphony, and I don't think I could have ever, ever believed, sitting somewhere up there, that anything like this would ever happen to my music. And I have to thank, immediately, Cameron Mackintosh. What an extraordinary production he's put together. Thank you, Cameron. We'll meet him in a moment. But before I go any further, the wonderful thing about musicals is that something has to happen that brings them all together. I mean, you can have a really great musical and one aspect of it could be wrong, whether it be the production, whether it be something to do with how it's staged or anything, and it might get buried and then take years to find again. But what happened so extraordinarily with this is that everything came together with Cameron as the producer. Before we go any further, I have to say that it would have never happened without Maria Björnson, and of course... Maria Björnson was, as all of you know, the incredible designer of the show: It was her vision combined, I think, with everything else that really brought us along. She tragically died some years ago. One of the greatest sadnesses is that she's not here tonight, but I hope we've honoured her spirit in every way. So. Maria, thank you. And I ought to say, tonight's rather extraordinary because I know that there are many companies of The Phantom of the Opera watching this performance around the world because it's being beamed around the world tonight. And none, I suppose, more important than the director who made it possible, who's in New York at the moment with the New York Broadway company, Hal Prince So, hello, Hal! And thank you for everything, Hal. So without any more ado, let's bring on the original creative team from London. Here they come, led by Sir Cameron Mackintosh. Charles Hart, our lyricist, of course. Andy Bridge, our lighting, and above all Gillian Lynne, who staged tonight. Thank you, Gillian. And the creative team from the Albert Hall tonight. Here they all are. Laurence, the director, in the middle. Now... Next, I have to thank our fantastic company. What a fantastic show. Ramin, Sierra, you couldn't have done me more proud. And Anthony Inglis and the fantastic orchestra. Just before we move on, I'm going to introduce you in a second to the original London company, but I just would like you to remember John Aron, Steve Barton, who of course played Raoul, and Mary Millar, who sadly are no longer with us, but they were wonderful members of our original team. So, a small appreciation to them, please. And here is our original London company. We have one other member of the company tonight who has hotfooted it from the London Palladium, Michael Crawford. Finally. And I suppose this is very special for me. It is a great joy for me to welcome tonight my Angel of Music, Sarah Brightman. But... Without these two, we would not be here. Uh, we have one slight additional surprise. Sarah has agreed to sing. So, I'm going to leave you in the hands of the Angel of Music. Maestro, take it away.
