Is that you, Denis? Yeah! So, you?re still here? Should your books be less messy, I would have gone home a long time ago. Oh, right, I forgot this was the end of the month. You forget everything. What time is it? - 7:25, I think. It looks like a hot day. There must be quite a load. What load? Across the street, the American soldiers? pay. They'd better take precautions: they say there's 500 millions That much? That?s what I?ve been told. Here: the salary of your laziness. Thank you. Why only 2.700? What about the boiler?s repairs? You?ve got no mercy for me. Are you or are you not a partner? And what about the Dutch beer? I?m thinking of it. - You?re thinking of it! It should have arrived two days ago. You?re really not fun. I must do everything. Every time I take care of something, I never do it the right way. You?re always grumbling. I?m grumbling when I have to. What I call common sense, you call grumbling. It really was more endurable when you used to join me upstairs. You were considerate then. And you took advantage of it. A girl must take advantage of middle age, while it?s still lusting. Yeah, well, don?t forget the Dutch beer, all right? NIGHT DEPOSIT Y. Legarec Cleaners Wake up, Gaston, it?s pay day! Thank you, boss. I wasn?t sleeping. I never close more than one eye, like Alsatian dogs. I filled her up. When it comes to filling up, I trust you. Oh, Mr. Farrand. Just a tiny litre. My motto is: drink while you?re thirsty, never more. Good morning, Mr. Farrand. - Good morning, chef. Good morning, Mr. Farrand. Good morning. Go get the meat in my car, will you? Good morning, Mr. Farrand. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Louise. What is that? Mrs. Farrand came here. She took away the hare. And she prefers this? This is quite colourful, but it doesn?t mean much. Art is like the army: it's best not to try to understand. Hi, love. Why are you looking at me this way? No reason. Did you finish your bookkeeping? Yes I did, and with Betty, it was no piece of cake Hey! You received the proofs of your book! How come they?re not in colour? For a paperback, it would be too expensive. Your publisher must be quite the ruffian. Another would be the same. Hey, here?s my hare. I wonder why you took it down. I think it looked good in a restaurant. Is this looking good too? What is it? Talcum powder maybe. Well, what do you know? - So now it?s drugs! I don?t know anything about it. I think intoxicating people is awful. - So do I, and you can believe me. I believe you, Denis, but admit I have reasons to worry.. Even in Indochina, I never took any part in the drug business. Do you think I?d start here? What do those bags mean, then? That someone's dealing behind my back and I don't like it. Will I be able to rest easy one day, Denis? What?s keeping you from resting easy? All those blokes you associate with. I don?t associate with anyone. Sometimes, I have a drink with a few old pals, but that?s all. You?re taking it back? - Yes, I am. Four-One-Seven Bartender, please! - Coming, Ma?am. I guess you need a pumice stone. You scum! I?ll teach you to deal your junk here. I wanted to straighten the painting up. I?ll straighten your face up. This is to buy cigarettes? I warn you: if you?ve got more. Get your shit and beat it! And tell your friends that I am a man of my word: when I say no, I mean no! Get it? You made a mistake, madam: this is far too much. Good night, Mr. Farrand. - Good night, H?l?ne. Shall I close the gate? No, don?t bother: I?ll close it when I leave. It?s closing time, gentlemen. They say you need a bartender. Yes, but I want someone young and distinguished. Take your pick then! No offence but I think you?re too effeminate for our standards. Hands up! Hurry up! You can tell your boss that this method won't work either. Come out! Get in the corner! We?re going to entertain you. Go on! Have fun! Hey, we told you to stay outside! Oh, shit, it?s the Doc! - Denis! Hey, Yankee! Are you crazy? Don?t touch that! Come on: give him a hand! And now get the hell out of here! Tonio, tell Henri that our contract is off. Got it? Watch the shipping manoeuvre. You?ll pay for this, Yankee. Come inside, mate! What were you doing with those guys? Savani introduced you? No, Henri did. Oh, the asthmatic! Here, take a seat. I hope those bastards left us to glasses to have a drink. The last bottle we drank together was in Saigon, in 1950. We?re not getting any younger. You didn?t change much. Oh, come on! I?m like old oaks: one more layer every year. You, on the other hand, are still quite the playboy. Of course: I was kept in a fridge, so I was preserved. - Where? Sing Sing. Six years. - What did you do? Nothing much. I?ll tell you the story. I was unlucky. Yes but you?re not careful enough. I've already told you. You must make your luck. I came to France four months ago. I wanted to make good my losses. Well, you sure took a wrong turn: there?s not future in gooning! Except at the ?lys?e. Well, some friends told me to see Henri But I can?t possibly work for him now. Don?t worry, I?m not going to leave you penniless. After what you just did for me, I owe you that much. It was natural. Say, I hope you're still a good eater because you'll taste this. When did you come back? In 1954. I felt the wind change, and thought I better not stick around So you became a respectable restaurant owner? You measure your respectability at the tax inspector's and I must say mine is not exactly gentle with me. You went entirely legitimate? Entirely... well... Some of it is. That?s why I don?t want the other ruffians to dump powder in my place. Still the same old fighting spirit, Denis! I?m glad I met you again! Same here. I often talk about you with my wife. You? Married? Yes, son. More than ten years ago. And with an intellectual! Not in the same league as Lulu from Buffalo Park, remember? In bed, Lulu wasn't that bad! Yes, but she had bird food for brains. And when you start putting on weight, you can?t stand this kind of broad anymore. Your wife knows about your past? Well, she knows she didn?t marry the sexton of the Madeleine church. Thanks to her I went legitimate though. Well, legitimate... you can?t change what you are overnight. This beats the army preserves. After that, you?ll have a local speciality, but with a red claret. Oh, you know, mixing drinks... Don?t worry about that. Tonight we celebrate friendship. If you collapse, I'll pick you up Come on: let?s get this inside before the rain! Come on in. I won?t put the lights on: it might wake her up, it's best not to. Come, this way. It reminds me of that time when I worked with a bloke called Riton the Eel. Did you know him? - Riton the Eel? - Yes. He was in the States in 1933. - I was seven. - Oh, yes, of course. You?ll sleep in the room at the back. There's always a bed ready for friends. We woke you up? We weren't noisy though. What are you using that flashlight? I?m burglarizing my home. Here... meet my friend Jim. I've told you about him: Yankee Jim, who studied medicine. - My wife! - Pleased to meet you! So am I. Where were you? At "La Chaumi?re". He came to vandalize it! I was wondering what became of him. Talk about coincidences! I don?t get it all, but I guess your friend comes here to sleep. Not only to sleep! To live here. - Of course he will. - I won?t bother you, madam. You?re not bothering me. No! you?re not bothering her. 'course not, you?re not bothering her. Here! Now you can crash, this is your home. You don't have any luggage? I didn?t have time to pack a suitcase. No, he doesn?t have a suitcase. And he doesn?t have pyjamas either. You can lend him some. Lend! Lend! I'll give them to him I won't give him one pair, I'll give him all my pyjamas. I can?t put on several pyjamas. I don?t have my toothbrush either. Did you hear, Marie-Jeanne? He hasn't got a toothbrush either. You must admit he?s unlucky. Indeed. Now you should go to bed. Let your friend go to bed. We can?t let him sleep stark naked, can we? Say, you must show him your book about Gothic cathedrals, I?m sure he?ll be pleased. Because he is smart and he likes the Gothic style. You?re getting crazy, Denis. Of course I?m not crazy. I?ve had a little too much to drink. No harm done! I don?t know ifyou realize? This gangster, here! He is no gangster, he is a paratrooper. Where is he from? Well, better to come from there than to go there. I met him in the Rushes Plain, in 1950. You weren?t even born yet. It's pushing it! Thanks to me, he could get away with his papers in order, they were all on his trail: the Vietnamese, the Provost Corps, the Foreign Legion... Better and better! We must hide him, because the others will try and off him. If I understand correctly, he spends his time being chased. Cause he is a lion. A champ, if you prefer. I don?t prefer anything. A while ago, when he saw me... well, he couldn?t do it. Heturned the situation around, so you should be happy. Who wouldn?t be? We?ve got to be careful: he mustn't be seen. What about the servants? Tell them he?s your American cousin who works in import-export. With you, I'll have seen it all! What about the pyjamas? Won?t you give him pyjamas? See this car? The guy who'll get out with a briefcase, is a bank clerk. Every penultimate day of the month, several of them go back and forth from the Banque de France. As a precaution, they fetch the dough in small packets. Right, now this is the next morning around 7:20 or 7:25. The Americans prefer to come and get their soldiers? pay before the bank opens, they think it?s safer. You can see the captain who?s in charge of the operation. This police van is a reinforcement bonus, courtesy of the city council. At this point, the money is still in the strongroom and will stay there until the very last moment. Now that everybody?s here, the captain knocks on the door. The teller in chief opens, in the company of the night watchman, whose job is over and who goes away. Now, we?re going to wait a little. And it?s the same at the end of every month? - Every month. - It?s a big project. Yes but we can't attack the convoy: it would take all the Katanga mercenaries. I?ve been thinking of something else. - You located where we are here? - Above the bank. Yes, and I own the whole floor. I?m also president of the amateur movie-makers of the district. At first, I didn?t realize how interesting that was, but when I saw the convoy, one morning, I started to think. And little by little, I realized the job was perfectly feasible. But the first thing is: we must know the combination of the safe. - And you know it? - I can get it. With one man in the place, it?s possible. And I can have a man hired by the Legarec society they're cleaning the whole bank at the end of every month. And I even know how to proceed so the bloke won?t know me. You?re going to do this job? Are you serious? To tell you the truth, I was planning it because it was a beauty, but I wouldn?t have done it alone. Since you?re here, though, I?m itching to do it. But aren?t you a rich man? Yes, you can call it vice. And also, let me tell you one thing: I?m bloody bored! You can?t imagine! I?m bored as hell! On some nights, I feel like I?m 90 years old. Would you do it? With you? Always! I?m warning you. It will be no piece of cake. We can?t afford the tiniest slip. You want to recoup your losses, well, let me tell you you?ll be able to count your assets again! This is the dough coming out. Do you see the satchels? Three of them. For a total of at least 500 millions Does it inspire you? It?s a nice load. The convoy is about to depart. Now, inside, here's only the teller and the two cleaners. O.K. Now, you?ll see the best part. It?s a garbage truck. It is. And it will be our friend. What did you tell him? To get a haircut and never come here again. Are you nuts? I?m the boss here. So, from now on, you?ll get laid elsewhere and on your own time. Got it? Oh, damn, you?ve got a nerve! If you think I?m going to obey you like a slave, you don?t know me. That was the third one this month, and they?re getting shabbier and shabbier. So I'm not free to love who I want? We?ll see about that: I?m going to screw the first man who happens to come in. - And if you don?t like it... - Please, be my guest... Ladies and gentlemen. If need affection, Gaston, the lady's in the right mood. - What will you have? - A beer and a telephone token. Give the gentleman a beer. - So? Is it done? - The guy is in the room. - How did it go? - Very well. Your system allowed me to talk to him without being seen. And what about the price? Twenty millions. After some haggling. It?s a fair price, you know. What?s his name? Maurice Labrousse, an unemployed musician. - No police record? - No... He?s sitting near the front door. First table on the left. He?s waiting for instructions. I?m on it. - Say... - Yes. Do you mind if I stay here for a while? - Why? - The barmaid. Do you think I?ve got a chance? Would you mind? Absolutely not, I?d rather have you than anybody else but I?m warning you: she?s a wild one. And don?t forget that we don?t know each other. It?s stout. Dark beer. I forgot to ask: maybe you?d rather have lager? Of course, I prefer the fair one. - I'm sorry. - I prefer dark beer though. What about you? - What about me? - May I buy you a beer? Not a beer, it's fattening. Georges? Bring me a brandy. The boss will get mad. - Is he so mean? - Mostly, he?s a bore. - Mr. Labrousse! - Yes. You?re wanted on the phone. Hello? Yes... Yes... Across the street! No, I thought you were just a tourist. Export-import and tourism are not mutually exclusive. But I would need a guide. A guide with eyes such as yours, for instance. Oh, you know, I would be a lousy guide. I wouldn?t know how to explain the architecture of the monuments. I can do without architecture. Maybe we could go dancing tonight? Do you know a place? The Sputnik is not bad. Rue Martineau. The Sputnik? - A club... I plan to go there tonight, I?ll be there around 11:00 pm. 11:00? This is going to be a long wait. I'm called Betty. My name is Jim. Close the door. First, I want to warn you: don?t try to learn who I am before the day of the job, or we won?t hesitate to kill you. I know. I agree. Now walk to the cupboard on your left. Open the door. Take the electrical floor polisher in the left hand corner. This is the appliance you?ll use to inform us. The lower part includes a transmitter-receiver and there?s an aerial in the handle. Now unscrew the end of it. See: there?s the mike. - I see. We?ve booked a room for you at the H?tel du Colombier, 14 rue Jules Ferry. Take the appliance and I'll tell you on the phone how to use it. You?ll practise and I?ll call you every night. When you?re good at it, you?ll bring it back here. See that nobody but you touches it. Also, as far as possible, don?t show yourself in town, especially not in bars. - I don?t drink. - Right. You may go now. He?s going to open it now. Twenty-one for the first combination. Eighteen for the second combination. Is the safe open? No, there?s a third combination, but the teller waits for the soldiers to enter the number. They?ll be there in 15 minutes. It seems somewhat short. Yeah, we?ll have to work fast. That was the initialization of the combination. Three! A gentleman at the bar asks for a "mominette". Do we have that? Yes, it?s pastis in a small glass, as in Marseille. Four and three. Wait: I?ll serve him myself. - I'll be back in a minute. - Yes, of course. Hello? Yes? Is this you, Mr. Farrand? Say, a guy just parked his car here. The license plate is from the Bouches-du-Rh?ne. He asked if you were here, I told him nothing, you know me. What do you mean, nothing? That I didn?t know. So he walked toward the Domino. I didn?t like his face. Well, that?s it, I just wanted to warn you, I don?t know if I was right. You were absolutely right, Gaston, I thank you. Yes... Oh, really? Well... No, I need at least ten or fifteen minutes. All right, I?m coming. What?s up? Are you leaving me already? I?m leaving but I?ll be back. Gee, I didn?t expect this! It?s for my work. Some urgent business. Urgent, urgent. What about me? Am I not urgent business? I need half an hour. Couldn?t you free yourself completely for once? I?m mad at you, you know. I don?t know if you?ll find me here when you come back. Be nice. Wait for me. I promise I?ll spend the whole night with you. Hurry up! Deal with your client briskly! OK, briskly! Madeleine! I have to run a small errand. I'll be back in half an hour. Thank you. Hello, Sir! Hands up! Get in there! There, on my right. Up against the wall! What are you doing here? Tourism. Is this against the law? - Who paid for your trip? - The Club M?diterran?e. Do you know this guy? It?s my buddy, Ange Peresi! I thought you were in Spain, Ange. Here, it's unhealthy for you. You must mistake me for my brother. Or for your sister, scum! Now explain what you?re doing here. You and your brother must have traded jackets. I?m afraid of meeting the wrong people. You just did. Is it in working order? I guess so. You want my gun? No need. With this, he?ll talk. All right, I?m out of here. Say, did you see this? So? you were sent to kill me? Tell me. I don?t talk to wimps. You shouldn?t talk to me like that, Ange. You?re hurting my feelings. Don?t you like fireworks. You?d better talk, Ange. You know me: I keep my promises. Come on, hurry up! Stop acting stupid, Jim. Talk! I didn?t come to kill you. We don?t give a damn about you. We can get you whenever we want. So, why? To see what the old man is planning. What do you mean? Well, if he teams up with you, we guess you're not knitting together. Did Henri send you? Yes! Henri sent me! I don?t give a damn. Diana! Brutus! Sit! I?ve got an appointment with Mr. Henri. I know. Please come in. Please allow me. - Here it is. - Thank you so much. This way... Glad to see you, Mr. Farrand. Do sit down. Did you heat up my milk, mum? I guess you do not drink milk, Mr. Farrand. You are in good health. You?re in wonderful health, Mr. Farrand. You?d probably rather have a small calvados. I?d rather we talked. Talking doesn?t exclude good manners, does it? You?ve got a weird way of exercising good manners. I fail to see... You fail to see who sent a bunch of redskins to destroy my joint? What about Ange Peresi? That angel didn't come from Heaven. Let?s be serious, Mr. Farrand. I imagine you came to propose something positive. I?m selling "La Chaumi?re" to you. That?s the positive thing. It seems quite sensible. Six months ago, I said no to your boss but I've been thinking since. Because, you know, I?m getting too old for all this bad boys business. I'll sell the joint to you and you'll do what you want in it. Well, you see, honest people always come to an agreement. Indeed... I?ll relay your offer to my friends. I?m warning you though... It will work under one condition: you leave my friend Jim Beckle alone. - You see what I mean? - This belongs to you, sir. Thank you, madam. Did you hear? If he offers that, he must be working on a caper. I know the old man well. Do you know how we called him, in the old days? The perfectionist! What have you got to say? You know I like movies. - Who gave you the key? - Nobody did. You shouldn?t be such a bully, Denis. You?d better be nice. - Where are you heading to? - To a partnership. You must be crazy. - What is she doing here? - Ask her. I thought you two didn?t know each other. I did warn you, didn?t I? Now if you want to win your money back, try betting on horses. You can?t call it off, Denis. Anyway I can't for sure. With a broad as a partner? We might as well pack a suitcase and head to jail. You must admit I?ve got brains: I managed to understand it all. It?s not a matter of brains, it's a matter of tongue, you idiot! Four years, rue de Douai, at Antoine Poletti?s. Didn?t I hold my tongue? Without me, more than one guy would have taken the plunge. We haven?t got a choice, Denis. Let?s give her 10%. Look. I?m doing this for you. You?re twisting my arm but I warn you: one slip and you're dead. I give you my word. And you may look at him: we?re of one mind, he and I. You don?t have to know more. You'll be safer this way. Do you understand me? Do we agree? Yes, but what about the dough? When shall we get it? Half now. The banknotes split in two. The other half of the notes, when the job is done. Fine. But we?re broke. Couldn't we get an advance? We?ll give you some funds for your expenses. All right then, we agree. Me too. And now stand up. Examine carefully the map in front of you. On the day and time that we?ll specify later, you?ll take the garbage truck and start at point A, in front of number 40, rue Jean Mermoz. You?ll stop in front of number 26, then you?ll cross Place Aristide Briand and drive to point B. Still in rue Jean Mermoz. This is number 26. We can?t miss it. This is a strange job, don?t you think? Two millions, just for this? I smell a rat. So what? Don?t try to understand. I would even off a grandmother for two millions. Look! Our arrival point is there. What if it were a carved up broad? So what? When you?re broke, you can't be sensitive. All right, if anything goes wrong, do not hesitate to ring me. But with that machine you will never have any hitch. - Thank you. - Have a good ride. And I would throw all the bombs, the rifles and the daggers at the bottom of the oceans. And war being forever banned, bliss will ensue - for each and every man. - Of course it will. Take advantage of the situation: go and please him nicely. He?s broke. Do you think my ass is the Salvation Army? It?s closing time, sir. Just a quick beer, I?m awfully thirsty. And I?d like to buy cigarettes too. O.K. but I warn you: I?m off to bed in five minutes. You're crazy! This is not the day to get plastered. Hey, are you nuts? Not now: we?ll need our brains tonight. - Have you got the tank? - In the garage. And it wasn?t easy. They came after him. The bastards insist and they?ll get me in the end. Yes? Oh, it?s you. Worried about what, dear God? I?m keeping my books, like I do every month. Nothing strange about it. No, I promise I?ll go home directly, as soon as I?m finished with "La Chaumi?re" Sleep tight, love. Good night. Don?t walk here: I?ve just polished the floor. - I?m wearing espadrilles? - It's even worse. - Listen. - ... best to do the job properly. For the wages they pay... Don't complain: you?ll get double wages in December. - I haven?t got enough seniority. - Where did you work before? It was in Paris, it was different... A thorough guy, Maurice! You memorized the code? You?re car number five. Jim is number four and the garbage truck six Cops are number 12, and you tell us where they come from. Not bad, your trick but with this, we'll learn as much. - If it works! - Don?t worry. I?ve given intravenous jabs every day for six years. The teller is there! - Hello, Maurice. - Hello, Mr. Goulette. Cold, ain't it? Yes, and they said on t.v. it would be worse tomorrow. It doesn?t bode well for January. I?ll deal with Gaston. With this, you don?t need gloves. No problem with fingerprints, it dries instantly. You and your witches? tricks.... Don?t tell me you believe in those. No, I?m having fun. Are you in high spirits? Tonight I feel twenty years younger! And to tell the truth: I don?t care about the dough, I only care about success. I?m only interested in the dough. Nobody asked you! Give me Gaston?s bottle. Enough to make him sleep till noon. His Lordship doesn't care about the dough. You heard him? I know him: it?s true. Then I don?t see why he argued so much about my ten percent. A matter of principle. Here, gulp this down: it?s a very good vintage. Thank you, Mr. Farrand. No need to spend so much money. Don?t worry about spendings. Tonight, you'll drink to my health. If it's to your health, it's not the same. - And here, for your kids? Christmas. - You?re too kind, Mr. Farrand. Bastards! They parked too close. I can?t move the car. Could you give me a hand? - It doesn?t look easy. - Thanks a lot. Good evening, sir. Changes again? I thought Darot was coming tonight. No, Darot is doing the docks now. Well... follow me. Sit down! There?s not much to do. If the insurance company didn?t insist on a watchman each time the army comes for their money, you wouldn?t have to come. What a useless drag! You never know. Car number five, here. No fare in sight? Central, here. No customers. Are you still available, car number four? Are you still available car number four? Say, let me explain. Later, when the men take out the trash through the back door you?ll go with them. I know the instructions: with my gun in hand. Well... Such are the rules. Hey, Daddy-O, will you come and dance with us! - You assholes! - Stop if you wanna fight! Quiet, Michel, or we?ll end up in the police van. - Come, let's go see Jocelyne. - Your Jocelyne is a dog! Today's youth! In my days, we had fun in a cleverer way. Well... I must go and open my piggy bank! - So? Is it open? - No, not yet. But it annoys me when the soldiers watch over my shoulder. I prepare the first two combinations before... Thanks... and I always leave the third one on hold. I enter it when the officer's here. It's simpler that way! And what is this? It's the alarm box. It monitors all the security system, all the shock and contact detectors, the microphones and even the alarm at the police station. I don?t even have the key: the senior executive does. If I got it wrong, it would make a terrible noise. Sirens and all that jazz. Well thought-out, isn't it? Our strong room can?t be breached easily. Hurry up! We?ve got 11 minutes left. Hold his arm flat on the desk, so that he can?t move it. Go wash your windows. We?ll call you when we need you. Quiet! Relax! You had a fainting spell but you?re better now. How do you feel? Weak. I feel weak. Get back on top. Now you must help us. You?re going to count with me. Go on... One hundred. - One hundred... - Ninety-nine - Ninety nine. - Ninety eight. - Ninety eight. Very good. Go on. Ninety seven... Ninety six... He?s ready. - Can you hear me? - Yes. - What is your name? - Charles Goulette. - What do you do? - I?m a bank teller. Great, Mr. Goulette. Do you know the strong room combination? Yes... I have to... Try to remember it. Try hard. Tell me the numbers. First combination. Twenty-one. Second combination. The second one, Mr. Goulette. Seventeen. And nine for the third combination. - He?s wrong. I heard eight. - He can?t lie. I?m sure of it. Listen very closely, Mr. Goulette. The last number. Would you repeat it? Nine... Shit, I?m not crazy. I counted eight when I listened If he says nine, nine it is. If we get it wrong, there?s going to be quite a racket. Come on, make it nine. - He was right: nine. - You see: my pentothal. Well, I have been sweating for a while, trust me. Well, now: no noise. There are microphones inside, directly linked to the manager's flat. and they can get the slightest shock. Car number four calling. Car number four. I?ve picked-up a customer Car number 6 in position? Car number six in position. No car number twelve in sight. Over. Number 4 calling. We?ve got a client for the six. Got it. I?m sending it to you. Central calling. Car number six? - Car number 6. Listening. - We?ve got a client for you. We?re coming. Hurry up. Three minutes left. The floor polisher. Now, pal, your turn. - Don?t strike me too hard. - Don?t worry, I know how. Something is amiss. Yes, let's call the manager. Go back to the police station. Car number 6 calling. Car 12 behind car 6. Let it by! Drive on the sidewalk. Here! Did madam see what they did at the bank? Yes. Is Monsieur upstairs? No, he?s having breakfast. Five hundred millions! Not a small sum! It can?t be! What can't be? So that?s what the two of you have been planning. Stupid woman that I am, I bought the friendship thing. The two old pals coming together again. All that play acting! How ridiculous I was! I had a bad feeling. I phoned the "Chaumi?re", the "Domino", but I couldn?t imagine... You?re only thinking of yourself. I thought it was over, that you had really moved on... And here we are. I can?t take it anymore. If anybody talks to me about this, I won?t be able to pretend. So I?d better go. It?s the best thing for both of us. You?re right, love. Go and rest in the South. Go! No, Denis. I?m leaving for good. If you cared about me, you'd never have done this. They put him to sleep with pentagram. - Pentothal! - It?s the same thing. - Say, Mr. Farrand, what a palaver! - Indeed. Any news? A bogus watchman did the job. The real one was found: he was knocked out then put to sleep with an injection. Is Mr. Goulette all right? I think so, since the policemen took his statement. And the two cleaners too. The're saying the same thing. You?re telling me! Good morning, gentlemen. - A terrible blow, isn?t it? - You're telling me! And you, across from here you didn?t notice anything? No, though I was most of the night, keeping my books. I just heard young people noisily passing by, but that?s all. Well, it was hard to hear anything anyway. Everything happened inside. It?s a master caper. - I may go to the safe? - Of course, Mr. Farrand. If you don?t mind, I?d like you to come to the police station for a statement. I?d be glad to, commissioner. Whenever you want. Are you still leaving tomorrow? It?s safer. If the cops question me, they'll quickly find who I am and where I come from. Can you imagine? Six months without you. Things will have settled down then. I?ll take my share and move it to Switzerland. We?ll meet there. And in the meantime, you?ll send me postcards. Be sensible. If I stay here, the others won?t send me postcards. How can I be sensible when I know you?re leaving me? Oh, Jim, you can?t know how much I?m fed up with this bar, of this town, this cockroach life. Take me with you. Without money, it?s not possible. Denis doesn?t want us to touch it before six months, and he?s right. Tell me that you care about me, Jim, and that you?ll miss me a little. I?ll miss you a lot! Our garbage trucks schedules are always the same. Of course, a mistake on the part of our employees is out of the question. Thank you. What Mr. Coulomb, director of the road network service, just said will be confirmed by two men. Habib Bouarid and Ali Kamza, who work in the cleaning service. The police were highly interested in what they had to say. It was all done. It was all done. You mean that when you arrived rue Jean Mermoz, the trashcans had already been emptied? Yes. Everywhere, there were trashcans but no trash. All emptied. We hope those testimonies will help commissioner Leduc, in charge of the investigation, and we will now follow up with a nicer topic: everybody knows that Paris is a Breton city... - Did you see? - It was to be expected. They?ll understand. Even if they do, where will it lead them? - To the garage. - I would be surprised. - They were there. - When? At six o?clock. Gaston just told me so. He was questioned. Commissioner Leduc and his whole team were there. What was he asked? He didn?t tell me. But the point is they looked everywhere. We must warn Denis at once. I tried to call him, but he?s not home. - What about "La Chaumi?re"? - He had left. I?ll try again in fifteen minutes. Hello? Yes....Who? I'm coming. Another reporter. They are leech-like! And they make passes at me too! The accident occurred yesterday, in the late afternoon. A parked railcar?s brakes failed suddenly. The railroad was sloping, so the railcar built on speed and, at the end of a mad race, crashed into... Ah! Monsieur scared me! Good evening, Ang?le. Is Madame in bed? No. Madam left after the phone call. What phone call? They called her around eight thirty. - Who did? - I don?t know. She was told that you fainted. I thought that she had rushed to your side. - Monsieur is feeling better? - Yes, it was nothing. Also, some gentleman asked for you twice. He didn?t want to say his name. And he'll phone again. Thank you, Ang?le. You may go to bed. - Good night, sir. - Good night. I?ll get it. Yes? I can?t hear you properly. Who is this? And where is she? You?re a motherfucker, Luigi. I fish where it bites. I want everything. Do you understand what I mean? Everything you got last night. Well, bring the dough anyway. As soon as I get it, you?ll be allowed to take back... the package. - Where? And what guarantees do you offer? My word as a man, Denis. It must be enough. - Well? - You were right, asthmatic! He cares about his old lady. - Is Jim upstairs? - Yes. I think so. Stay here. There are customers. - What?s up? - They kidnapped Marie-Jeanne. Savani? Yeah. And he wants all the dough, or they?ll kill her. What? And I know them: they won?t hesitate. So we must send them the dough, and I came to ask for your agreement. You're crazy We can't give them all the money. We can save her some other way. We?re not playing our lives, this time, but hers. And I don?t have the right. Look, you saw me working, you know what I can do. I?m sure we can do it. No, I don?t want to risk it. My wife?s life is in the balance and nothing else matters. But you won?t have to regret it, I?ll need a little time to find the money, but you?ll have enough to go away and prepare the future. When must you give it? At night. 3 A.M. We must get it out of the pit. You could do it. I already did. I knew that, but I?m happy to hear you say it. What? You don?t think I would double-cross you? I don?t think anything but we've got no time to lose. The cops went to the garage, they looked everywhere and questioned Gaston. Why didn?t you tell me? Betty tried to reach you at la Chaumi?re, you were gone. - So? - I put the bags in the Fiat trunk. I parked it rue Jean Mermoz until we made a decision. Here are the keys! Now you just have to make your delivery. Although it makes me sick. I thank you, Jim. The wheels! What about the wheels? I left it at the corner. There! - Are you sure? - I?m not crazy. Where?s Betty? She went out less than five minutes ago. Say, Gaston, did commissioner Leduc come to the garage? Commissioner Leduc? No, I didn?t see him. Did she have a second key? She?s probably got a second key for each and every lock. Shit! We?re not going to see the dough again any time soon. Go and see them. Tell them you couldn?t take the satchels with you. I?ll follow you. Impossible. They would be wary. I swear, Denis. I'll take the other car, and I'll tail you. You?re going to take the other car, but you'll do something else. Don?t move. Where are the satchels? There are no satchels. Take me to Mr. Henri. I?ve received no orders about this. I?ve got to see him. It?s urgent. Marcel! You'll follow us. Come on! I'll drive! He doesn?t have the dough. But he wanted to see you. What is the matter, Mr. Farrand? I need some extra time. I couldn?t get the money out. You surprise me. Cop trouble. They watch the zone where I hid it. You?ll have a hard time convincing Mr. Savani of that. Don?t move. What game are you playing, Mr. Farrand? You?ve been here for ten minutes, saying nothing. Well, I?m going to tell you something now, but tell your goons to get out. I want to talk to you alone, and what I have to say is very important. All right, but if you try the slightest trick, your dear wife... You?ve got nothing to fear. Well? Somebody stole the 500 millions. Let?s be serious, Mr. Farrand. I?m very serious. But you?re going to have my wife released immediately, and I?ll have your old mummy released. - What are you saying? - You must phone her right now and my American pal will give you news of her health. Sit down. Yes? Jim Beckley here. Yes, your mother is here. Do you want to talk to her? Don?t give in, Henri. I?ve lived my life, they can kill me, but don?t give in. You see? She's all right. It?s now 3:30. You?ve got until 4:00 to save her. Come on, hurry up, have my wife released. Yes, but it?s a delicate matter, you understand. And a dangerous one. Savani will be here at any moment. Even more so. Hurry up. The American will not spare your mother. Come with me. Open, Antoine. Everything is in order. Come, Marie-Jeanne. It?s settled. On your right, there's a staircase to the front yard. When you get out, take the first road on your left. Three kilometers from here, you'll see a gas station you can make a phone call from there. Hurry! What about the money? It?s upstairs. Everything is in order. Wait a second. Don?t go so quickly. Let them go. Hands up! Go, quick! And do phone! This is going to cost you a lot. Don?t move. My only consolation is that they'll cut your neck. Jim? Everything is in order, you can let the granny sleep. Now listen closely: I?ll meet you at the railway station buffet at 9:30. A train leaves for Paris at 10:00. I?ll bring you some dough. You raised your son badly. He disobeyed you. Madam, police! Your papers, please. Yes. What?s the matter? You overtook at the top of a hill, you drove over the yellow line and did not respect the speed limit. We?ve been following you for a while. I?m in a hurry. My mother is very ill. That is no reason to endanger other lives. This car is not yours. No. It belongs to my boss. - Mr. Denis Farrand. - Yes. What are you going to do now? I?ll get some money for Jim. He's waiting for me at the station. - He must get away. - Of course. Shall I go with you? Will it cost me a lot? Your licence will probably be withdrawn. You?re really unlucky. Is the spare tire in the trunk? Oh, no, thank you, I?m used to this. We?re not that bad, we?ll give you a hand. I?m not asking for anything. - If you take it like that... - I don?t need anybody. - I thought you were in a hurry. That's none of your business. Go! So, what?s in that trunk? I forbid you to search my trunk! You don?t have the right! And, pray, what is this? I just need five minutes. - Good morning, Mr. Farrand. - Good morning. Thank you. Well, Mr. Farrand, I have the feeling that yesterday you didn't tell me everything about this case.
