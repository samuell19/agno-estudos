This is my first day in Baghdad... The place I left 20 years ago It was a big prison then... Now it's a big mess. Everything's changed in this city, the smell of blood is everywhere.... But your place in my heart remains. All I have is this camera, Suad. It's been with me for years. It's like my destiny. These cassettes, they summarize 20 years of my life. The tears, the joy... The sadness. The weariness... My affection for you, my love for you. Suad... Time is a merciless killer. And this is the only way I know how to stop it. ... Reuters broadcasted last Sunday images showing Iraqi militiamen poised on rooftops firing from their automatic rifles. The scene begs serious questions about the sectarian divide in the country. Iraqi politicians, Sunni and Shiite, responded with a statement about the violence during the Imam Kadem pilgrimage... Please don't come out here... Be careful Suad... Suad... Don't come near me Suad... Mother! Mom please comeback here... Telll me you're ok... Why did this happen Dalal? I told you he was coming to marry my mother, why did he shoot him? How should I know which one... I did what all the neighbors do, what happened this time? I'll call you later Dalal. Mom please calm down... Let's figure this out together. What does she want calling you? This isn't the time, we're in trouble. Here drink some water. Shut your mouth! What are we going to do? Let me call the police, we have nothing to lose. They're useless. All of Baghdad is trying to call them... I'll handle it. Haifa 2... Haifa 2... Haifa 2... Haifa 2... Three people coming with a coffin - check them. Young man... Please move me to the corner. I beg you... - Please move me... - Nobody move! Just move me to the corner... [Salam Mohammed Saleh. Born in 1986. Went missing in 2003] Why did you put it out? Where do you think you're going? Dalal's house. Her brother Abo Muthana can fix this. You're not going. These people are trash, and without honor What honor? Baghdad is drowning in shit and we're at the bottom. Even Ahmed, our last hope... There he is thrown in the street. I was waiting for him to come marry you so we could leave for America. Now what? It's all over. You're not going! I'm not going to lose you like I lost your brother. My brother's dead, just forget about him! Get him out of your head. He's nothing but another corpse in the trash like many others. For God's sake let me help you... [I need to get medicine for my mother please let me pass] I want to take him off the street now. It's out of my hands. I tried with him but no luck. What else do you want with him? I'll do what you asked for. Me? Are you messing around with him? I told you someone was coming for my mother and I did what all the neighbors do. This is your brother's turf. I'll try. But this will cost you. Just work with me. Your whole life will change. I'm right here Dalal. Any son of a bitch you want me to sleep with American, Jihadi, army general just choose. This is the Nadia I want. Just don't raise your voice. What happened? What did Dalal say? I'm talking to you, answer! She wants me to fuck her brother and all of Alqaeda! Shameless! I'll cut your tongue off if you bring her up again. Enough I'm tired! Do you know how tired I am? Did you forget what you did with Ahmed? In the end he left you and your son for the US! Why didn't you answer Abu Muthana? Don't get us involved in your problems. I have enough. And I'm real bitter. You piece of shit! We were told not to fire. Why did you shoot him? He's a relative of Nadia's which means we're fucked. If she complains to him, we're done for. You're trying to be a man by challenging them? These people are like concrete walls, only idiots like you would bang their heads on them. And get Nadia out of your head. He wants her all to himself. Moron. ... how the US administration's decision to finance sectarian militias which ignited a civil war and tore Iraq apart. This is also the story of a man sent by the US military ... What's wrong? Salam... Say something... Are you going to keep staring at him? That's it you killed him. Let them take him off the street... I won't let them until he dies like the dog that he is. I don't care what anyone says. This is for Suad... Take it to her. Don't forget... Take it to Suad. What happened can happen to any man... I know my love... Let them take him off the street... I've got business with Nadia and her mother. This is none of your business. Sometimes you forget who you're dealing with. You'd better watch yourself, especially with Nadia. Eat shit! You eat shit and know your limits! You're nothing but our employee. Shut the fuck up! You're mine and I can do whatever I want with you... I'm not in the mood for you right now. Get out of here. Get out! I hired him for your sake. He's a stranger to me to be honest. But because you sent him, I've treated him like a brother so far. But Hajji he can't disobey orders. That's it Hajji, whatever you need. At your service... Goodbye. So what have you done with your dear husband? Husband? This is temporary he can rip up the contract whenever he likes.. Rip up the contract? This is a marriage sanctioned under God and the prophet! And I'm the one who permitted it! I'm no pimp! What you're saying is wrong. What did you do about Nadia? Her mother's messing with her head. She won't allow it. You need to show them who's boss. You're the Emir here. You have the right to anything you want. A lot of people in your circle have their eye on her. If you don't make a move everything you've built will come crashing down. I'm Abu Muthana. Whoever tries to cross me his days are numbered. Even a fly that zips through Haifa Street I know where it came from and where it's going... Don't worry. Your hands are clean. Raheem brought this from near Ahmed. My name is Ahmed Jabbar. Iraqi with an American passport. I escaped from Iraq because of a death warrant. I returned with the Americans and agreed to help in Abu Ghraib prison. I didn't want what happened to me to happen to others. But I was witness to everything. Everything that happened in Abu Ghraib. I saw how they tortured prisoners with humiliation... No human being could tolerate it. Even the innocent was turned into a monster. I tried to stop them many times but I couldn't. They started to threaten me. When the scandal broke, they blamed me and others. And they kicked us out. A few days ago, one of the translators I worked with was found dead. I knew my life was in danger. This is why I'm making this tape. At the end of it, there is footage of torture in Abu Ghraib that no one has seen yet. These images must reach the whole world. Everyone must know what happened in Abu Ghraib. Who's that guy on the street? And who said you could kill him? Listen you: Don't forget who you are. You came out of prison like a rat, you didn't even have enough to buy a cigarette! Now you want to mess with me? This time I'll let it go for the hajji... Next time I'll crush your skull on the pavement. Get Nadia out of your head. Got it? Salam... Salam, answer me. Hold your fire Salam. Salam... Hold your fire. Salam... Hold your fire. Do you copy? Just man up Be a man Salam. Abu Abdallah... Get Salam out of here. Relocate him to the side by the river. Replace him with one of the Arabs. That's it make it happen. Here they are what do we do with them? Get rid of them. They're useless. And the translators? We have nothing to do with them. If that's the case then why did he shoot him in the street? ... on the other hand, a curfew has been encforced in Baghdad due to other sectarian attacks and explosions after the bombing of the two Askari imams in Samarra. The US and Iraqi government condemned the attacks with US military General Kevin Bergner stating that the bombing of the- Get up! Asaad! Send me two guys now! That son of a bitch has me cornered in the building. Quickly! I'm going up to him now. I'll go up to Suad's and get Nadia. Let's see what he does then! Let's go. Step away I'll get it. This is just a warning. Next time I'll bring this house down on your heads! Your actions became unbearable I’m the one protecting you, if not for me... The Americans would drag you and press your head with their shoes Who do you think you are? You were a low level fighter. Crime is what brought you here! Get out! Shut up you disrespect able bitch! Save the hooker talk for your sister not me! Don't you dare mention Dalal! Dalal has more honor than your whole tribe! Let go of my mother! - Watch me take her! - Let go of me! I'll throw you back to the streets! Let go of me! Go up and shoot him from the roof! Make one move and I'll kill you, got it? Get out of here. Leave! Asaad... Come down quickly. Come down and follow me to Salam's building. Move fast! You son of a whore! You attack my people. Son of a bitch! Asaad! - Shut the fuck up you piece of shit! - Asaad help me!

I don't understand... What are we going to do with Abo Muthana? Leave his body in the street too? Tell her to come take him. Move! Come back! Announce it to all the mujahideen: Salam is now the Emir. Today was a nightmare. He killed him like a dog... and we might be next. This guy's stubborn... But the higher ups won't let this go. It's going to be a blood bath here. Kill or be killed. There's no place for us here. I'm leaving today Why don't you come with me? Why don't you answer? Son of a bitch. Suad... There was this moment I can't forget... It's become a recurring nightmare, with me wherever I go. There was this young man constantly in tears... They forced me to film him naked as they raped him. When our eyes met I felt responsible for everything that was happening to him. Suad... I don't know why. It was as if he was my son.
