This film was composed from found footage filmed by Wesley Tersago and supplemented with police tapes, news and surveillance footage. Recently the Tersago family was arrested on charges of serious crime. To children nationwide they are known as Clown Norry & Co. - Coenen and Willems, judicial police. - Kiss my ass. Mrs. Tersago? Would you be so kind to accompany us, please? Yup! Two to the left, two to the right, two remain here! Whoa, kid! Can I at least get dressed, please? Don't you think this is a little too much? Are you just going to stand there, or what? Well, on with it I guess. Is everyone here? You guys smell that? Smell of smoke detected on ground floor, over. Roger, we'll check. We are now leaving the residence with the suspect, over. Smoke in the kitchen. I repeat, smoke in the kitchen. Oh right, I left something in the oven. Suspect claims to have left something in the oven, over. Those walkie talkies sure are fun. My kids loved them as well. You know what my Wesley used to call them? A wonky tonky. And my Amber called it a wockely tockely. A wockely tockely! SCUM We'll make it easy on you. You are suspected of committing assault on Gerard Peeters, known to you as Jay. And of murder or manslaughter on your girlfriend, Flower Da silva. On Walter Lambrecht, CEO of Confidis International. And on André Deseure, police officer and lover of your mother. Might there be a few we don't know about? Are we playing the silent game again? André The Police wasn't happy at home anymore. His wife knew my wife was sleeping with him. So his home became his hell... He just ran away from home, and in a couple of weeks he'll be back. With a nice tan. Did you know... that these are the best kind of sandwiches in the world? White bread with Herve cheese, dunked in coffee. - I could eat a whole bread of those. - Delighted to hear it. It's just... too bad about the plastic cup. Could you also tell us when you saw André Deseure last? If I get a stone mug. A couple of weeks ago with Rachel. I have no problems with that guy. What can you tell us about Louis De Man? - Lou. - Lou! Good kid. Could you repeat the question, officer? Ronny Tersago and his son threw Gerard Peeters from a bridge onto the highway. Right, they say that, but I don't buy that shit. Nevertheless, that came from a very reliable source. Who? You. Me, a reliable source? It says here that you're from Antwerp. I was born in Merksem and raised in Berchem. - Then why do you speak Dutch? - Do I speak Dutch? - I'm not speaking Dutch. - You were a minute before. You read that in my file. That I suffered a personality change after I tried to commit suicide. But I'm completely cured of that, buddy! - Zneba? - Zneba. Durga Zneba. Goddamnit, you psycho! You must be confusing me with someone else. - Did she say that? - She doesn't remember anything. See? Why did you place your laptop and cell phone in the oven, Mrs. Rubbens? Because I didn't have time to erase the hard drive, Mr. Coenen. Are you going to keep asking stupid questions? What was on there we weren't supposed to know about? If I say that, it would've had no point in destroying it, would it? Nice going. I hope for your sake you tone it down in front of the judge, Mrs. Rubbens. Mr. Coenen, Miss Willems. Read my lips... Go eat a bucket of shit. - Madame Tersago. - Yes? Your son and grandson are suspected of assault, blackmailing, burglary, armed robberies... That can't be... Goddamn it! Are you related to Madame? I'm her granddaughter. Do you have a problem with me patting you down? Not at all. - Right, you get fifteen minutes. - Thanks. Grandma. - Grandma. - Who is it? It's me, grandma. Amber. Amber! Oh, my sweetie. - Are you the new camera operator? - Right, a change of shift. Are you allowed to drink after your heart attack? My heart is fine. My blood pressure is just way too high. Very dangerous. - Why's that? - Effortil. Isn't that medication for low blood pressure? But if you take enough of it, you'll get a very high blood pressure. - How much did you take? - A whole box. It was like I was on XTC. Yes? Madame is no longer under surveillance, if she's better she can leave. Okay, thanks. And... What are you doing tonight? Goodbye, everybody. - Madame Tersago, what are you doing? - I'm going home. - Are you allowed? - Sure, I'm allowed. - Did the doctor say so? - I say so. - You can't! - Sure I can. - They don't seem to get that... - Look... That's Durga, the boss of club Heaven. I used to dance for her, she didn't even recognize me. Lou sure did a number on her. - What's that, Amber? - My new vroomvroom. - And where did you get it from? - An old lady who only drove it on Sunday. - You have a ticket. - What the hell are they doing? If a disability card doesn't even help here... Mom and dad will be released on Friday. And Lou as well. That's fantastic. And Wesley? Dad called. It doesn't look too good, Amber. - They say he killed that black girl. - Flower? They dug up her body in the forest. She was wrapped in plastic, and they found DNA belonging to Wesley. Duh, he was her boyfriend. And his fingerprints, inside of the plastic. Then I'll finish his film myself. Hello, guys and gals. Hello, my little kittens. Are you up for a good show? I know I am! Action, action, action! Yummy! - Your brother's a special boy, huh, Amber? - Wesley is a genius, grandma. Yes, fantastic... But it kind of frightens me. Yeah, me too... That I won't get to his level. I am Teacher Amber. Teacher Amber. And I'll be replacing Uncle Wesley. Who is legitimately absent. Is he sick, Teacher? No... Is he sick, Teacher? No... Uncle Wesley is in prison again. Silly, silly Uncle! Shit! No, this can't be... A stroke. I think. 75. On the parking lot of the municipal park. The park, yes. - Were you filming us Amber? - Yes. You're not working for the police, are you? - Terrible, right, Jarek? - It will be fine. - He needs to calm down and smoke less. - Jos... Right... - I'm actually talking about Wesley. - Bad news for Wesley. I don't know how mom's going to react. Hey, sweetie. Your hair is pretty like that! - Jarek. Is Jos inside as well? - No, I'm here for you guys. That's sweet. - Hello, Madame. - Your hair looks good. - It's so short! - Buddy. - Is Jos inside as well? - No. Jos is not well. - Not well? - I'm here for you guys. - What's wrong with him? - Brain attack. - It's not a stroke, is it? - A stroke, yes. Geez... Well, I think we're all good to go. - Come on, Lou. - What? - What about Wesley? - What? Aren't they keeping him inside? - Lou... - Oh, you didn't know yet? Wesley, my poor little guy... Everyone does whatever they want, and he's always the scapegoat. It's been like that since he went to pre-school. The curtains caught fire, the school almost burned down... Everyone could have done it. But no, he got the blame! - But he did do it, mom. - Yeah, yeah... But they couldn't have know that, Amber. It's a brain infarct just like Bernard had, Ma. Do they know what the damage will be? It's possible that he'll be half paralyzed. Or that he can't talk anymore. I hope he fucking dies. But that he'll have a long time of suffering. That he pisses and shits his pants. - I'm throwing a party next week. - You can talk? I'm expecting you next week Tuesday. At 6 p.m. Dress formally, please. - Jarek will pick you up at quarter to 6. - What are we celebrating? You'll see. Just be ready in time. Can you walk already? - That's what wheelchairs are for. - Right. Okay... - I'm glad you can speak again. - Yeah. You look like you are. Can you move your arms? He's lost his marbles. That's fantastic. Did you write all of this in jail? - In a week. - Really? It's not really Shakespeare, Lou. - What's funny? - Give me that magic wand... Alakazam, there go your pants. - Good, right? - Do you have any music yet? Who wants to go on a witch hunt with us, we love the dark, the mist and the dusk Everyone's afraid of us, scared, so scared That's how we want to keep it and we're keeping it there You ended up in Darker Land, the land where the light is banned Where Crakula reigns with his right-hand man Clown Grimmy the Reaper, Grimmy Reaper Ronny, that's genius, really, man. - Thanks, Lou. - It reminds me of whats-it-called... - The Nightmare Before Christmas. - Right. Why is that? - Because I stole it from that. - Oh, right! Congrats. - You still got it! - Alright... - When do we get started? - Next week. - Really? - We're back in business, man. - Can you call Mike? - I lost his number, you know. Lou, don't be childish. Amber? - I'm game. - Lou? Who am I playing? Here's the Beaster Hunny! - Girls? - Beaster Hunny! Where is the Easter Bunny?! Mike, it's Beaster Hunny. - What did I say? - Easter Bunny. - Isn't that correct? - No, Mike, we say Beaster Hunny. What's a Beaster Hunny? Okay... - Look! An Elephant! - No, Mike. You point at the sky. I look at the sky and step on a banana peal. Sorry, Ronny... - I don't think this will work. - Mike, I've told you this... Don't think. That works better for you. - I can't perform like this. - What's so difficult about it?! Look, an elephant! - Nope. - Goddamn it! - Alright, who's going to get him? - Not me! I'll go. I have a soothing effect on Ronny. - Is Rachel coming to rehearsal today? - No. - And? - They were still talking. Do you guys actually like the elephant joke? Goddamnit! What is this bullshit?! You have to shut the hell up! I'm going to get him. Ronny! What's the deal, man? - Easy. - Lou... - You feeling a bit better? - A little. - The new one's got nice tits. - The things you pay attention to... Yeah, pretty good... But I'm missing something. Amber, perfect, sweetie... Lara, Corine, it's really good, but... I think you can do better. Nah... Way too naked. Here's the best man of the family! Are you allowed to call before your trial? Remember Willy from Café River View? Willy The Silent, he used to work for Jos. Willy is now a warder. And this is Willy's cell phone. - And this is Willy. - Willy, goddamn! - You okay, Wes? - No. I can't keep this up. - They know everything. - Did you admit to anything yet? - I didn't open my mouth yet. - Keep quiet, son. What did Joris say? He's not sure what to do. Joris is a fucking fine lawyer, kid. A real dirtbag. Could you give Joris ten thousand euro's? The hashish and the porn are expensive here. And then I can call you again. - Okay. - Thanks. - Can you say hi to mom and Amber for me? - Hi, Wes. - Hey, your hair looks good. - So does yours. - Don't give up hope, Wes. - Nah... - Wesley really can't break, Joris. - Right. If he does and he starts talking, he'll take us all down with him. - Then the shit will hit the fan. - Ronny... Right, did you pay my first commission yet? I'll get that in order. - And Wesley needs some allowance. - Oh, yeah? - Twenty thousand. - I thought ten? - Did you talk to him already? - Yes. I'll transfer it along with your payment, bye, Joris. Bye, Ro... Filthy thief. - Jarek for the family. - Yes, yes, my little drool buckets. There stood Jarek. With his minivan. To safely bring our little clowns to Jos' party. Because Uncle Jos said so. Will there be dancing? Will there be drugs and booze? Will the prince choose for Teacher? Definitely! Oh, how pretty Teacher was. - Good evening. - Hey, there! - No, I'm not getting into that. - Why not? This is a retard van. Stop joking and get in, Ronny! Hey, sweetie. Is this okay, Jarek? You look pretty! - Did you have to say it like that? - What, retard van? Jarek has a cousin with Down syndrome. I think he has a bit of it himself. Oh, please! What's wrong, dad? - I've got a bad feeling about this. - Bad feeling? - Why? - I don't trust Jos. What are you thinking? Why isn't my mother with us? 20 years ago Jos did something similar with some street gang. 5 men in a minivan, riddled with 200 bullets. It's a child lock. What's the problem? The brake, dad! Yeah, Ma? No, we're on our way. A couple of minutes. Okay. No, no problem. See you soon. I'll be god damned... It was a surprise from both Jos and Grandma. And just look at Jarek. Amber, you're not doing it right. You first have to push his chest 30 times. - We learned differently at school. - Then you didn't pay attention! - I did, dude! - Dude, dude... - Dude?! To your Mother?! - Get the hell on with it! Well, do it yourself then! Faster, Ronny. Right, that's it. Good, you're doing good. Yeah, that's it! And now mouth to mouth. His nose... You have to pinch his nose. - Mom. - Rachel. - His nose. - Pinch it. - What?! - His n... Yes! Are you okay, buddy? What happened? - Yeah, you became unwell. - I don't know what happened. - Don't tell Jos, okay? - No, but... - I'd see a cardiologist if I were you. - Will do. Just go straight here. But don't tell him, okay? - No, you can count it. - And the other guys too. - Guys? - Yeah? - Don't tell Jos, okay? - Nope. Mon, goddamn! They still didn't shoot you yet? - Boss, glad you're here. - You alright, buddy? Absolutely. I usually spend my day off with hookers though. Did you open up your candy shop just for us? Jos is still the big man of the Slaughter House District. Jos. - Take a seat. - Ma. Hey, sonny. Jos... - Hey, Grandma. - Hello, dear. - Hey, Ma. - Rachel... - Hello, Jos. - Everything good, kiddo? - You sit there, next to your man. - Hi, Jos... - A new photographer? - If that's okay, Jos. It's a party today, right? But no pictures on Facebook! - Or that other thing, with the little bird. - Twitter? No, Jos. You watch yourself! Does everyone have a full glass? To freedom... And to love. Okay, toots. Dearest family, and friends of the family. Today is a very special day. And not just because they had to let us go... but because we've shown that they cannot break us. And because Jos and me have something important to say. But I'm sitting down for that one. Yes... I was once a young, silly goose. And Grandpa Tersago had been in prison for more than a year. For something he never did. But that's okay, he did enough other things for him to be there. By now we all know what happens when a young girl is suddenly left on her own. The whole neighborhood calls it a disgrace... And from one day to the next, you don't see your friends anymore... apart from some perverts, wanting to take a shot. But who was there... for a year and a half, to stick by me through thick and thin? Jos. To comfort me? - Jos. - To protect me? - Jos. - Yes. I am talking about 1958. The year of the Universal Exposition. Yes, Ronny... At the end of 58, Grandpa Tersago had been locked up for a year and a half. And in January 59, you were born. For the passed 56 years, you think you know who you are... and from one moment to the next, your whole life appears a lie. Your mother deceived you your whole life. And your father never was your father. It's like your whole life suddenly exists... from someone else's memory. There is no present. You don't exist anymore. You see yourself sit there, like behind glass, but... It's not you. Ronny... I saw you were shocked and... I think you still will be freaked out for a few days, but... You're my only son. As far as I know anyway. And, Ronny, if anyone's ready to follow in my footsteps after 50 years... It's going to be you. If anyone's not ready to follow in that prick's footsteps, it's gonna be me. I'll be ready for it when he's gone. But that doesn't mean I'll wait for that to happen. - Here it is... - Thank you very much. Jarek is like the Caruso of Antwerp, I swear. Oh, come on! - Jarek! Jarek! - Come on, kid! Rachel? Blood... - Where did you get hit? - My butt. - Jay, you alright? - This is just a scratch... - But my foot is seriously stinging! - Oh, man. Those assholes... He was just able to walk again. - This doesn't look good, Jos. - Goddamn it! Such a good kid... Wally, it's me. Right now. That's Wally, the doctor. - Does he still do this kind of thing? - Only for friends. Yes, Wally. It's Ronny. Get to Restaurant Cattle Trade, bring your gear and take enough with you. You've never seen anything like this, man. No, no, no! Don't roll them, if they have so many holes in 'em. Then they'll drain even quicker. Jeffrey! Don't push on it either, boy. Come on, pick him up by his shoulders. Then this girl can slide the plastic underneath it. Child, stand still if you have to puke. It's just more cleaning work, if you start running around. What's with all the puking here? Try focusing a little, guys! You don't have to see it as a dead person. But just as a big piece of meat. - Wally, take a look at Jarek first. - I'll do my very best, Jos. Hello, everyone. - Hey, Mikey, goddamn. It's been a while. - Doctor. - Lou. - Wally. Yeah, he needs blood, urgently. Does anyone know his blood type? - A positive. - Does anyone have A positive? - I do. - Isn't there anyone else? That won't ever be enough. What do you think Wally? Will it be enough? Why not? Okay. - Do you feel anything, madame? - No, go ahead doctor. The bullet is not in that deep, miss. That's a ricochet. I got a booboo! Thank you, doctor. Are you from around here? Born in the Slaughter House District, but with a practice in Schoten. Do you do house calls outside your borough? Only if it's very urgent. Thank you. - You can bring Jarek to the recovery. - Will he make it? - I can't know that, Jos. - What odds are you giving him? 50-50? You can't be serious. - He's not a doctor at all. - How so? - Walter Baelus, veterinary medicine? - A veterinary is also a doctor. He's a good vet, you know. I had a student job there twenty years ago. Hey, he saw my private parts, Ronny! Come on, Rachel. That's nothing for those guys. How do you mean? They're used to having their hand up a cow. - Thank you. - Well, toots... I thought tonight would've ended differently. Just be glad we're all still walking around. - Not really, right? - Jarek will be fine. Do you still know your way across from here? The slaughterhouse? Ronny, they've got new machines now. Computer controlled like at the car shop. Amber knows everything about computers, right, sweetie? Everything. - You can't just get in there though. - Mike can get in anywhere, right, Mike? Sure... if the ledges aren't too high. Self-knowledge is the beginning of all wisdom. Can somebody get my tools from the car? Just hang 'em up here. Everything okay? Absolutely. This is some place, huh? Complete corpses. Not exsanguinated. With bones, skin and intestines. Maximum weight, 90 kilogram. That's it, right? - Definitely. - Absolutely. Okay... - Definitely. - Absolutely. Okay... - 5... 4... 3... 2... - Wait. - Yeah? - And then what happens? I press start and then it starts to grind. - To grind? - It's a meat grinder. Right. - Yeah. Okay. - Okay, here we go. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Here we go. Take your seats and keep your arms and legs inside at all times! There's not much happening, is there? Yeah! - That was it? - I guess. - It wasn't actually that bad. - I imagined something way more scary. Lou, can you empty that bucket into the air cannon? I'm not so good at that, Ronny. - Mike? - No problem. - Next! - I'm starting to get bored. - This wasn't so boring, right, Lou? - Man, man, what an evening. Okay? - Okay - Let's go. You know what I feel like doing right now? Oh my god. Oh my fucking god! Come on, Mike! - Love is a beautiful thing, isn't it? - Pretty special though, right? Did you know they could have perfectly normal kids? You think so? That's the goddamned twentieth time they're rerunning this... - Or were you watching? - Nah... - Mom. - Yeah... You alright? What was all that, yesterday? - How's your shoulder? - Wally did a good job. I replayed it in my head at least 100 times last night. And when I finally fell asleep, I kept dreaming about it. - The shoot-out or the meat grinder? - Both. You seem hungry. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, Ma. Right, you were always a good eater. Coenen and Willems, judicial police, Part 2. Judicial police? Part 2? Nooo! Our thugs were so scared. Scared? Our thugs, scared? I didn't think so! All cops are pussies All cops are pussies - Thank you. - Thanks, madame. How's your heart doing? Did your daughter get into the movie business as well? Yeah... My son is temporarily unavailable. - Temporarily? - I think... I think you better watch what you say right now. - Your son... - You even better change the subject. - Wow, good stuff. - So, what's up? Ronny! What do you think? - Miss, Mister... - Mr. De Man. Yeah, looks good. What are you wearing on your feet? Rabbit feet, I think... I'm still working on it... - Can you show me? - Wait... OK, can we please stay on topic? This is our business, honey. Blue rabbits. Right, Mr. Tersago... Colleagues of ours have reopened the case Dejong. - Papa Lou! - Hello, hello, everyone! - Arrogant pricks with bratty kids. - Here they are. These are the ones. Absolutely. Those are perfect. So... - Dejong? - How many times were you there? - Once. - We believe you've been there twice. - But the second time wasn't to perform. - We know that you killed those people. And we think that you stole a few million there. And here's the funniest part... Do you know Boris Malkin? The Russian drug lord of Amsterdam. No kidding. I thought you meant Boris Malkin, my wife's hairdresser. That Dejong guy we think you killed, was the accountant of Boris Malkin. And that money we think you took that night, all belonged to Mr. Malkin. So if you would happen to remember anything about a roasted chicken, for example... Or a whack with a cactus... Or if you have the idea someone is trying to murder you... Call us. And the mastermind behind an international drug gang. Boris Malkin ordered the liquidation of multiple people involved in the criminal world. His trademark is that he usually performs the executions on his victims himself. He made 6 casualties himself in a bloody shoot-out in Antwerp last year. Despite the evidence, Malkin was released due to procedural error. Come on! - Here. - Thanks. I breathed in a cookie crumb! Take the call, it's Wesley! - Hi, Wes! - Amber, listen. I have 20 seconds. There's a gaming console in my room. New, still in the wrapping. - An Xbox One? - Right. I want you to hack the OS, and overcome the limitations. Stick all the programs on there that are on my iMac... And hide a charged iPhone 6 in it. My lawyer will come get the box. - Joris. - Yes. Goddamnit. I almost thought I was a goner. How was Wesley doing? He asked for a gaming console and a video game. That's it? - Yeah, he's bored. - I can imagine. - How was he doing? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. They get pampered in prison, don't they? I convinced Wesley to co-operate with the case. To get reduction of sentence and a deal with the inspectors. Joris, don't make Wesley talk. - He can talk without speaking, he said. - Okay. Suddenly he brought up this gaming console. I was seriously shocked. The deal with the inspectors was almost called off. - You managed to stop that from happening. - Yeah. - Good boy. - I didn't know he was into those games. Yeah, it's an addiction. Ever since he was eight. Day and night he'd be in his room, mashing those buttons. With 6 liters of soda, and 10 family packs of chips. He only came out to take a shit. - Is there anything else I should know? - Yeah... Jos has some health problems. He'll have to take it easy. - He's not retiring, is he? - He already did. - Then there will be a successor? - There already is. Who? Me. Congratulations. Make sure Jos doesn't see that camera, sweetie. He won't. Good afternoon. Wally. Ronny. Amber, you alright? How's the shoulder? Any pain? - No, I'm good. - That's good. It's next door, I'll be right there. Ronny. Hey. - Has he woken up yet? - No. Who were those three dirt bags in that restaurant? We don't know. Where did that million and a half come from, that you paid me back with? A couple of Dutch people. Business people. They get rich from breeding flowers, I bet? How much did you steal there in total? Never mind. Your empire is at an end! Your business finished! - Here you go, Beaster Hunny... Correct? - Yes. Take this! Katchaah! Okay. Lou, enough. Lou... Stop the music! He's having a seizure again. Lou's epileptic seizures are becoming a problem. I think I'll have to give him an easier role. - He's going to be disappointed. - Yeah, well... Good work, sweetie. It would be great if we could perform during Easter. Isn't it a bit early for a Halloween show? Which part didn't you get, Bruno? It's an Easter show. The creeps of Clown Dracula, the boss of Hallowinia, kidnap the Beaster Hunny. - The what? - The Beaster Hunny. They make all the kids cry. But at the end they work together... - And all the kids get their eggs. - Right... Doesn't that story sound like The Night Before Christmas? - Didn't you like it? - I did, it was a great movie. Well, then? Yeah... But Philippe Geubels booked every night of the Easter Holidays. - So... - Bruno, we only need the afternoons. Ten days two shows of 45 minutes. One at 2 p.m. and one at 4 p.m. I'll ask him, Ronny... But I'm afraid he won't like setting up his stage every time... - You're afraid...? - I don't really like it, Ronny. Because you have to show up an hour earlier? - Two hours and half. - We want to compensate you for it. If you want you can do me. If I want to bang a goat, I'll visit a petting zoo. Queer. - What's it going to cost me? - It's not about that. - I have other things to do, you know. - Like what? That's none of your business. In real life he's not that fun. That's none of your business. He's earning way too much, if you ask me. Is he still there? I don't see him... There he is! - You crazy nut! - Hey! Geubels! You have my card. If you change your mind, call me! You're fricking insane! I think he won't break. He's stubborn as hell. Let's just see about that. What? - Hi, Phillipe. - Ronny? - You got a minute? - No, not really. - Did you know that dog looks like you? - Yeah, that's the point. - Geuring! - What kind of dog is it? - A Chihuahua. - Really? Are you sure? I got the papers and everything. With a pedigree, be careful! I think they hustled you, man. I think... It's a bat. Have you tried making him fly? Huh? Can you fly? He pushes a cart full of eggs, each egg as big as a human head - Does he have sharp claws then? - I don't know. - It is a blue rabbit - It is a blue rabbit?! - It is a blue rabbit - Good, Rachel. - Didn't we change the color? - No. - We decided on blue. - I sure hope so. - My girlfriend's been sowing day and night. - Wasn't blue too much of a Smurf? Blue. We decided this during the breakdown meeting. Like how we decided I would play the Beaster Hunny? So? Now we have an actor as big as a Smurf. He's got on blue clothing. The children will get confused, Ronny. Lou... Mike plays the Beaster Hunny, and that's it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... Okay, thanks, everyone. Here. - Did we get some exposure? - Some exposure? 7 articles, 2 covers and a coloring game with free tickets! There you go! 7 articles, 2 covers and a coloring game with free tickets! There you go! Okay... Look! Stand up comedian Phillipe Geubels and his dog fell out of their bedroom window yesterday. There are currently no details about the incident.

Just like frog legs. - They throw away the rest of the dog. - Chinese people are not wasteful. Listen to her. She fucked a Chinese guy once and she thinks she's a sinologist. - A what? - What did that dog do to you? - What's the problem? - You don't do that. Listen to him. I remember you trying to drown that dog at Dejong's place. - I was dealing with a burn out, man! - A burn out, is that what you call it? Don't change the subject! You're an animal abuser. You always have been! Right. But me throwing a guy out of his window is no problem? - How can that dog help it that his owner... - Come on, You don't have to throw... Lou, Rachel, please! The most important part is that we're performing. You ended up in Darker Land The land where the light is banned Welcome in Hallowinia.

When I came out of prison I had the feeling... That everyone talked behind my back, even my best friends. I didn't want to face people anymore. Rachel, it's me. I have a crazy question. Hello, my dirty Crimi-Wankers! You probably thought Uncle Wesley vanished off the face of the earth. Forget it... Uncle is busting out of here. I'm taking you on a wild journey to sunny Cuba.

In the car! Calm down! Calm down! Police! Show me your hands! Shit.
