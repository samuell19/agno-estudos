Oh, she's a little contrary, but she's a good ole gal. - That's right as rain. - Stubborn ole female. - Well she just wants me to make a living honest. - Uncle Woody put her up to that. - Reckon he's a big man out west in Las Vegas. - There's no gambling and he knows the movie stars by their first name. - Yeah, I recollect the last time he was up here in these hills, he brought a blonde woman with him. She mighty skinny, but right pretty. - Yeah, it's hard to tell though with all that paint she was wearing. - Ah, you fellows know she was a living doll. - That's right, she' was as pretty as a peacock's tail flying over a petunia patch at sunset. [lady laughing] - Uncle Woody could always pick 'em. - Yeah, he's a sharp man to them dice too. - Yeah, old Jake played dice with him one time. Lost about 50 gallons of liquid so quick, he didn't even have time to think up a cuss. - Sure was odd the way them dice just rolled outta his hand. - Well I guess if one of them fellas that shoots them dice doesn't know how to handle them. - Yeah, well I still say it is mighty odd. [whistle hissing] - [Daniel] Hey, this thing ain't getting heated up too much ain't it? - Yeah, it always builds up about this time of day. - Yeah, maybe we ought to get another load of wood into Jake. - Sounds mighty funny to me. - You don't reckon that valve's stuck again? - Well I expect I better go look. - Yeah, it gets your head up sometimes. We might best mosey on down behind the truck. [steam hissing] - You think it'll blow up? - Fire in the hole!

[laughs] it's called "Betty Cooker's Crop Book," [audience laughing] - Woody that's great, that was intense. I'm telling you, we ought to go to Nashville right now. - Better get the wood cut first or Aunt Clem'll skin him alive. - Sara Lee, I told you, you talk too much. - No, Sara's right. I got too much work to do to be running off to Nashville. - Oh listen, you could take Jeepers motor bike and be back before midnight. - No, I better concentrate on cutting wood and forget about singing. 'Cause they don't seem to like me anyway. - Oh, that was just 'cause they knew you were gonna be singing Woody. - She's right, nobody gets to be a star in their hometown. That's why I keep telling you we ought to go to Nashville and get you one of them fancy trimmed suits with the rhinestones and everything. - Maybe in a week or so I might head that way with you. Soon as we help Jake get his still operating again. - Shh, it might be government men around. - Not only that, one of these days them government men gone swoop down and knock Jake's still over. And then what are you gonna do? Make pies for Aunt Clem? - Aunt Clem's been awful good to me Jeepers, she helped raise me. And I darn sure ain't gonna run out on her. - Well your Uncle Woodrow did and look what it got him. Just right to the top. - You're just after the monetary things Jeepers. - Well, a guy's gotta watch out for his future now, if he's got any talent like Woody have. - That's what I like about Jeepers, he's practical minded. He's gonna be a good storekeeper, just like his pa. - No, I don't wanna be a storekeeper, I wanna be one of them big artist managers in Nashville. And the good Woody Woodrow Wilson is gonna be my first artist client, ain't you? - I hope so. Hey imagine my name up in lights, 10 feet tall. - Flashing, going off and on and saying Woody. - Can you picture it in all the newspapers? - Yeah, a cross-country tour. - Yeah. - And a record contract. - Yeah. - And movies. - Yeah! - And maybe even your own television show. - Yeah, hey I can hear it now. I can hear the sound of success. [audience clapping] - That's nothing but the kids applauding Bill Anderson. Come on you cute dreamers, we came here to dance remember. - Not me, listen you keep thinking about Nashville, and we'll be right back. [slow country music] - Come on Woody, let's dance. [dramatic music] - I'm sure are proud of you for winning that pie contest last night Ma. - Oh. - Yes ma'am, we sure are proud. - Should've heard Cousin Woody on that bandstand. He was singing like a mockingbird. - Really? - He was real professional like Aunt Clem. Jeepers thinks that Woody should go out to Nashville and get himself into the Opry. - Oh he does, does he? What gives you that notion young man? - 'Cause show business. See I figure me and Woody, we can go a long way together. I'm gone be Woody's manager. - Show business? - Yes ma'am, that's where all the money is. [engine rumbling] - [Woody] Aunt Clem, Aunt Clem! - It's Woody! - Woody, now what's he doing come home so early? He's only been gone since sunup. - Aunt Clem. - What in the world is all the hollering about Woodrow? You're gonna scare off all the chickens with that caterwauling. - I ran into Barney Jackson down at the crossroads and he was on his way out here with this telegram. Uncle Woodrow died. - Oh. - And the lawyer in Las Vegas wants me to come out and settle his estate as soon as possible. - What's it mean Woody? - I don't know. - It means your brother's an inheritative, that's what it means. - Woody, you're rich. - Yeah. - Rich? - You're plum wealthy. - You have a little more respect for the dead. Even though he was a heathen gambling man. After all, he was Woodrow's Ma's brother. May God rest her beautiful soul. Now that makes him my kin. He left the whole shooting works to you Woodrow. - Ma, you think Woody really is rich? - I reckon he'll have to wait till he gets out to Las Vegas to find that out. You can leave this afternoon, right after the chores. - I'm gone go up to the house and tell the folks the good news. - You shouldn't be so happy 'bout that poor man passing away. - You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to Las Vegas and I'm gone do everything that I can to live up to the trust he had in me. - Go on to Las Vegas, and I'll go with you. - You're going with me Jeep? - Yeah, I'll go with you. Go out there, I'm gone be your manager ain't I? And I'll be right there to be sure them sharpies don't take advantage of my client. - Well, I guess I better get some chores done then. - I'll help you, Woody. [upbeat music] - Well, I finally got the truck loaded. - [Jeepers] Well, no need in waiting around any longer. Let's move right along. - You stay away from those beautiful Las Vegas showgirls, do you hear? - Oh, little darling, no fancy long-legged showgirl could ever turn me away from you. - Wish I was going with you to make sure. - Aunt Clem needs you here, she does. I wouldn't be going myself, 'cept Woody needs me to help him drive, that's the only reason I'm going. - Ha, I know why you're going Jeepers, so don't you give me any stories. - Now listen, oh dang, cross my heart. That's the only reason I'm going. It's duty before pleasure. - Now listen, you behave yourself Woody, you hear? - Okay sis, you take care of Aunt Clementine. - I will. - For heaven's sakes, I almost forgot your food supplies. - Thank you Aunt Clem. - [Aunt Clem] There ain't no use just squandering your money on cafes and such. - Well thank you. - Now listen, when you get to Las Vegas, don't you let nobody do you out of what's rightfully yours. If you get in any trouble you get on that phone and holler and I'll come running. - Okay, and I'll be as alert as Uncle Woody was. - [Aunt Clem] Yeah, because them city folks, they do some mighty funny things where money is concerned. - Right. - Now you sure you wanna take that old truck? You might as well go on the train. - Oh no, no, we're saving money by not riding the train. Besides old Lightenin' it'll get us there, don't you worry 'bout it. - Well, you take care of yourself boy. Bye Jeepers. - [Woody] Bye sis. Bye Sarah. [slow dramatic music] Thanks a lot friends. [upbeat country music] [engine backfiring] Howdy ma'am. - Oh, I'm so glad you fellas saw me and stopped. I don't know how I managed to do it. I do know better but I've run out of gas. Now there's this wonderful station down the road, that is practically a museum. So you two just be dears and get back in your truck and push me up there okay? - Yes ma'am. - [Jeepers] Down the road a piece? - I wouldn't gripe about it Jeeps. At least you got to admit that the scenery looks a little better today than it has. [upbeat music] [engine backfiring] - Morning Ms. Tawny. What brings you out so early? - I like to get away from the city for a while after work. - Can I fill her up for you? - Yes please, but would you help those boys with their truck first? I want to use your telephone, Sam. - Yes Ms. Tawny. Looks like you're mighty lucky to get this far. - [Woody] Oh, you don't know ole Lightenin'. - Ain't she one of those movie star persons or something? - Now, the biggest star you'll ever meet in Vegas. - Show is a beautiful woman. - Yeah. - You think you can fix our truck for us? - I think you ought to push it in the back and live it for the lizards. - You mean after driving it 2,000 miles? - Where bouts in Tennessee you fellas from? - Johnson's Corner. - Gamblers or guitar pickers. Ah, must be guitar pickers. Most gamblers drive $6,000 cars when they go that way and ride a $100 bus when they go that way. - What happened to $6,000 cars? - Same thing'll happen to this $20 truck if you get there. Honest Harry Tulip'll add it to his used car lot. Say, what seems to be wrong with it? - Oh, it's just a little tired I reckon. After all, we've come 2,000 miles. - You got a drink of water anywhere around here. - Yeah, there's a well over there. I charge a dollar a quart. - A dollar a quart? Seems like water ought to be free. - Well, after you fellas are out of the hills awhile, you'll learn the only thing free in this world is your mother's love. Hey, I'll be back to see you in a minute. - Those young men look as if they've come a long way. - [Sam] Guitar pickers headed for the bright lights of Vegas. Can't see how he got this far with that beat up old truck. - They broke? - [Sam] I guess so. - Well Sam, if there's any charge for fixing their truck, put it on my bill. - [Sam] Yes ma'am. - Don't tell 'em who paid for it. - [Sam] Okay, anything else? - No thank you Sam, see you later. - [Sam] I guess so, I ain't going anywhere. - Be sure and come by the club if you decide to go into town. - [Sam] I will ma'am. - [Tawny] Bye. - [Sam] Thanks again. [upbeat dramatic music] - That's the best it ever sounded, what you do to it? - Oh, just tightened it a bit. A few new gaskets, adjustment here and there, some fanning wire, spit spark plugs, and set the timing, and it's just like new. Well almost. - How much we owe you? - 50 cents for the banding wire. Now don't think I give away supplies for nothing. - 50 cents, you sure that's all we owe you? I mean you don't seem like the type to be giving stuff away, anybody charge for water. - He always stick his foot in his mouth like that? - Yeah, sometimes he get both of 'em in there. - Oh I thought so. Well, you better get going before I change my mind. - Yeah, let's go. - What did you say the name of that saloon was? - It's the Golden Circle Casino. Woody inheritated it from his uncle, that makes him rich and I'm his business manager. - You don't say, well maybe I should've charged you at that. - Let's go Jeepers, we got a long ways to...

[audience clapping] [bell ringing] - Welcome to the Golden Circle boys. I'm Boots Malone, your host. Come on, join the fun. We're having a wake for our dear departed boss and friend. The unluckiest crap shooter this side of the Las Vegas Strip. The only thing he ever won was this joint and my contract. [laughs] Neither would change his luck. So drink up, the drinks are on the house. [crowd cheering] - No, they ain't either. - Friend, when I say drinks are on the house, they are on the house. I'm the general manager 'round here. - Well I'm impressed. And this here is the new owner, Woody Woodrow, and if he says there ain't gone be no more free drinks, there ain't gone be no more free drinks, right Woody? - Well, I don't see any reason giving away our profits till we find out if we have any. - So you're Woody Woodrow. [chuckles] I'd never recognized you.. Uncle Woodrow said you were sort of shy. - The new owner would like to have a staff meeting in the office. - The new owner better go see Uncle Woodrow's lawyer, Mr. Hiram Shackleford before he decides to become the new owner. - [Customer] Does this mean there ain't more free beer Ms. Boots? - That's it. [customers grumbling] If he's Woody Woodrow, this is his business, including my contract and debts. - Debts, what kind of debts? - Oh, Uncle Woodrow was a big spender. - [Customer] Come on Paul, let's get outta here. [customers grumbling] - Looks kind of lonely don't it? - Yeah, maybe we ought to bring the cows in from outside and turn it into a dairy. [laughs] - I'll be at your disposal until midnight when I go off shift. During that time I'm supposed to entertain the customers. - Well, if ain't no more customers start coming in pretty soon, it don't look like we're gonna get to entertain anybody, so why don't we just sit down and have a talk. - You know, I better telephone the lawyer and tell him you're here. He's sort of anxious to meet you. - I bet he is. Woody, why don't me and you go out and have a little business conference. - All right, excuse me ma'am. - Maybe we ought to fall back and regroup. 'Cause I don't like the look in their eyes when she talks about all them contracts and all them debts. - I don't either, but you got to admit we come a long ways to find out what I've inherited Jeeps. And I darn show ain't giving up without finding out what the outcome is. - Yeah, well I guess it's the thought that counts. But I got a funny feeling we gone spend a lot of sleepless nights 'fore we through with this place. - I don't doubt that. But you just look around, can't you see the place has possibilities? Picture a bandstand over here with a bunch of bright lights standing down on it. Windows over on this side. - Well, you've got it, so we might as well get on with it. - Got what? - A bug. - What kind of bug? - Show business bug, it itches all over. Going around this season. - Well, it beats the devil outta chopping wood. Ms. Malone, you get this legal eagle lawyer on the phone and we'll find out just what my uncle really did leave me. - Okay, Al telephone. Thank you. - There you are ma'am. [dramatic music] - In other words, I've inherited a barn nightclub, Ms. Malone's contract, a brand new convertible that's not even paid for, and $38,000 worth of debts besides the other odd dollars and cents. - Well, that's about it. Of course there might be a few more creditors that haven't filed as yet, but that wouldn't be more than say a couple thousand. - Just $2,000, added on to the other $38,000, which makes a total of $40,000. - Well, plus a small attorney's fee. - Don't that underwhelm you? We've been in town two hours and we're $40,000 losers. - Well when do we have to pay all this off? - Well, there is a Mr. Harry Tulip, who's quite insistent. Your uncle bought the car from him and he's quite a persuasive man, this Mr. Tulip. I'd suggest that you pay him immediately, if not sooner. - With what? - Well you, you mean you're broke, flat? - Well not exactly. We've got about $60 between us, ain't we Jeep? - About $60, but we're a long way from $40,000. - In that case Mr. Wetherby, let me advise you to forget about your inheritance and go back to Tennessee. Now if you just sign these papers, I'll have the creditors take over the Golden Circle. - Not so fast, not so fast Mr. Shackleford. My mama didn't raise no fool. - Well. - And I'm gonna take a crack at this nightclub business before I give up. You with me Jeepers? - I'm with you, yes. - But you don't have any money. - I've got something better than money. - Oh, such as? - Tell him Jeep. - Perservance. - Persa what? - Perservance, P-E-R, perseverance. That's ability and get up and go, which is what he's got a lot of, talent. - Talent, I'm afraid I don't quite understand. - Well you see Mr. Shackleford, we're gonna make this saloon work for us. I pick a guitar, so I'm gonna pick and sing, and Ms. Malone's gonna sing and dance. And we're gonna show Las Vegas something they ain't never seen before. - [Mr. Shackleford] Is that a fact? - [Woody] That's a fact. - Now where you're gonna get your financing? - I told you I already had around $60 between us. There's a lot of people got started on less than that. - There's a lot of people. There's a whole bunch of people got started on less, it was I don't know how many people got started on less than 60. Could you name me three? - Never mind, let's get to work. I'll see you later Mr. Shackleford. - Yeah, cheers. Well, Mr. Wetherby I kind of figured you'd change your mind. - No, I haven't changed my mind. I wanna list of every one of those creditors, and I wanna call on every dag burn one of 'em myself. And I want it the first thing in the morning. Milking time in the morning. And that's pretty dag burn early. - Milking time. - Of all the nutty ideas I've ever heard of. You can't turn this place into a hillbilly music hall. They'll laugh you outta Las Vegas. - [Woody] You do the fast songs and I'll do the songs that I know best and we get a small band to start with. - Yeah, with what? How are you going to pay them? - Well I wouldn't worry about it, because we'll figure out something. Maybe a miracle'll happen. - I hate milk, I don't understand why I drink it. Till you showed up, my stomach felt just fine. Now I think I'm getting an ulcer. - Well I'm sorry you dislike me so much, but I need a girl singer, and I did inherit your contract. And it's paid up until-- - Until the end of the year. Remind me about it. I'll have to start drinking more milk to quiet down my would be ulcer. - Well, is it a deal then? I'll do the country songs and you do the fast and uptight what you call go-go things. - [laughs] I guess so. Who could argue with a guy who's willing to shoot the works on a joint like this? Well you gotta be nuts. There's ain't enough cowboys with money around here to start a good fight, let alone pay for drinks. - Well country music may have something to do with it, 'cause it sorta works on you you know. It's good for the troubled soul. - Oh yeah, and there's a lot of troubled souls in this town. Let's see if we can find a band. - All right. - Okay. - Okay. Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I mean friends and neighbors. Welcome to the Golden Circle Club. We'd like to start the show off tonight with our little singing star, pretty Ms. Boots Malone. - Stinker, here's one of Al's favorites.

[solemn music] - Pardon me for not knocking, but I don't feel very polite this evening. - Oh, you didn't need to knock. Hey, how come you call me Stinker? - Because you are a stinker. You've been miserable to everybody. Every since you found out your uncle died broke and left a mess of bills, instead of a Rolls Royce and a bank full of money. - Well he did leave me a new convertible. Of course, it's $7,300 to pay off on it. - He left you more than that you simple jerk. - What? - But you're feeling so sorry for yourself, you can't see a thing but people beating on your bar to get paid. - Yeah, from the time I get up in the morning till I got to bed at night. - You any idea how your uncle handled bill collectors? - Yeah, more than probably, he took them to the bar and gave them free drinks all evening. - Well that was part of it. He used his brains you know, that thing you have between your ears that you don't exercise too much. - Well you can get to the point anytime you're ready. - The point I'm trying to make is, that you should use your noodle, fake 'em out, just like Uncle Woody did. - But I'm not a good faker. [motorcycles roaring] [tires squealing] What's wrong now? - It sounds like the Marines have landed and brought their tanks along, come along. [tires squealing] - How you get rid of 'em? - Ah, they're harmless and boy do they spend money. - Yeah, but they gonna wreck this place. - Hey Jake, play "Dixie" like you never played "Dixie" before. ["Dixie"] [audience clapping] Oh, I'll be right back. I gotta quick change for a minute, okay. - "Dixie." - Now what do you think of the club? - How long does this go on? - Until you throw them out. They arrive about twice a year, hang around all night, then move on in the morning. Probably headed for a rally somewhere. It's business. - Yeah business, if they don't tear the place down. - They won't, I can handle them. - Yeah, you can handle 'em till they get stoned, and then what? - Then you can throw them out. I've gotta get back to work, I'll see you later. - Give her a hand Jeeps. [Jeeps clapping] [Jeeps whistling] Not that a way. I mean help her with the beer, clown. - Oh, what kind of deal is this? I'm supposed to be a business manager. - Well this is business, manager. [upbeat country music] - You must be new around here son. - Yeah, I'm part of the new management. - [Mr. Tulip] [laughs] Moose, he's part of the new management, how 'bout that? - [Moose] How about that? - How 'bout that? - [Mr. Tulip] You must be Woody something or other right? - No, I'm Jeepers. - [Harry] [laughs] Moose, he said he's Jeepers. - [laughs] He's Jeepers. - Well, where do I find this Woody whatchamacallit? - He's down at the other end of the bar helping Al server beer, I'm his manager. - Oh you're the manager? Well I got to inform you that your client owes me $7,300. Now tell me son, I'll discount a little if you prefer paying cash. - What you mean, Woody really does owe you $7,300? - Oh son, now you're starting to see the light. Not only does he owe it to me, but his children owe it to me, and his children's children owe it to me. You see son, when Honest Harry Tulip writes the contract, it is tight. - It's tight. - How 'bout if y'all come back a little later. How 'bout, 'bout Groundhog Day? [man laughing] - You hear what he does, Groundhog Day. Isn't he funny? - [Jeepers] Don't break me. - What's going on? - Oh would you mind telling this big bodyguard person to put me down, that I'm the general manager here. - You must be Woodrow Wilson Wetherby's nephew. - [Both] That's right. - Well you and I got a little talking to do in private. - About what? - About money. - Is that right, well I'm not too sure about that. - Well I'm sure about it. Moose! Don't dent 'em, don't dent 'em Moose. - Watch out for 'em Woody. That guy'll steal the gold outta your teeth while you're asleep. - Funny, very funny Boots, a pretty girl is funny. Ain't she funny Moose. - Yeah, she's funny. - Yeah, she's funny. Gently, gently now Moose, take it easy, take it easy now. We don't wanna bruise the gents that's gonna pay us our loot. [customers chattering] Oh now son, I wouldn't waste my energy hitting the Moose. Why he keeps in shape wrecking the cars in my junkyard, by hand. [laughs] - What right you got coming in here... What right you got coming in here trying to make a fool out of us in front of all of our customers? - Well I'm sorry 'bout that friend, but I get the impression you're trying to duck out so you won't have to pay the money on that automobile that your uncle bought. $7,300 to be exact. - [Woody] Well you're the fella the lawyer was telling me about. - [Harry] That's right. - He said you was a rough customer, but I didn't know you'd be like this. Welcome to the Golden Circle Mr. Tulip. - Well I'm glad to be here. - Nice of you to drop by. - Thank you. - But to be honest with you, I don't have a dime to pay on that car, so you might as well just keep it since you took it back anyhow. - You don't have a dime? I knew you was a deadbeat first minute I looked at you. I just might have to foreclose on this whole bar. Take everything in it. - Well go ahead. I owe more on it now than what it's worth. The only reason I'm keeping it open is 'cause the creditors haven't closed me up. - Well son, that puts another light on things. But I got an idea. You and I gonna be partners, I'll take 80% of the place, pay off the debts and let you run it. How 'bout that? And you know something? Business continues like this tonight with that motorcycle bunch out there, me and you gonna be real happy partners. - Well I have to think about it. - Yeah, you just do that. Come on Moose, we got work to do. Partners, that sounds real good. I ain't had a partner in a long time. - I wonder what cemetery the last one you had is buried in? - Hey, that's funny. [laughs] [body thuds] Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. - Moose, Moose, don't bruise the man, you heard me say that, come on. - That's something else, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Go on back to work, I'll be out in a minute. [audience clapping] [slow dramatic music] Operator, long distance. I wanna speak to Mrs. Clementine Wetherby in Johnson's Corner, Tennessee.

[Jeepers] Hey Woody, Woody! Come over here! [dramatic music] - [Woody] Hey, who's pretty car is that round in back? - I don't know. - Did I have any more phone calls? - [Jeepers] Not any. - Any bill collectors? - Hadn't been any. - Hey Jeeps, you don't spell guitar G-I-T-A-R. And you don't spell pickers P-I-K-E-R-S either. - That's all right to the E right? But you spell money M-O-N-E-Y, which is something we don't have a lot of around here. - Well, I guess you're right Jeeps. I'm a little disgusted after talking to that lawyer fella anyhow. Uncle Woody sure must've been living high on the hog. - Don't worry about it. 'Cause the good Jeepers got his money brain working. - Well I'd rather the good Jeepers get his hands to working moving some of these tumbleweeds and clean up around here. - Listen, that's part of my ingenious plan. What we do see, is we declare this whole thing a disaster area, and then apply to the federal government for federal aid, and then we build a whole new bar. - And you can get that look outta your eye 'cause we're not doing anything dishonest, like creating any twisters or floods or anything like that to get the federal government to pay on. - Them federal government people, boy they pay off quicker than you can blink an eye. - Yeah I know it, and you would be blinking your eyes looking through the bars of a federal penitentiary too. - Yeah, you got no faith in me. Shoot, why don't you make me the general manager, then we'll make some money. - Yeah, and you'd manage to get both of us in jail too. - The trouble with you... [dramatic music] Is you don't have any faith in my business brains. - Which one of the thunder struck young men is Woodrow Wilson Wetherby? - Tall, good looking one. - Well they're both good looking. I'm Tawny Dobbs. - [Woody] Aren't you the lady that we gave a push to the other day out on the desert? - That's right, you were very kind to help a lady in distress. - [Woody] Yes ma'am. - [Jeepers] We were gonna ask you for a ride, but Woody wouldn't leave his wood truck, would you Woody? - I see you made it all right. - [Woody] Oh yeah, well ole Lightenin' still got a lotta miles left in her. - I suppose you wonder about my dropping by like this. I was your uncle's protege. - [Woody] Is that a fact? Well he never mentioned anything about any proteges in any of his letters. - Oh he had lots of proteges, but I was the only one that worked hard enough to suit him. He called me his work of art. I loved to hear him talk. It was so sad to see him leave this earth. I know he's happy up there. - You're talking about the same Uncle Woodrow that we knew, I think you just blew a kiss in the wrong direction. - You don't have to pay attention to him, Ms. Tawny. Sometimes he lets his mouth get ahead of his good sense. - [laughs] I often do the same thing. It makes life more interesting. Dear Woodrow told me so much about Johnson's Corner. I've always wanted to visit his relatives, but he was always too busy. Your uncle was the hardest working man I've ever had the privilege of knowing. He'd stand at a dice table for hours on end just waiting for his luck to change. - He must've waited a long time. - His luck was the worst I've ever seen. [balls knocking] Are you a gambling man, Woody? - No, I don't know too much about it. - Well I'd be happy to show you if you'd care to drop by the club later this evening. - Well I appreciate it ma'am, but I've got my hands full trying to run this place. - I wish we knew one another better. It's hard to talk to someone you've just met and all. - Well. - How do you like the apartment? - Oh I like it fine, yeah. - I picked the furniture and the drapes myself. - Is that right? Well, you got very good taste. - Well, I have to go to the club tonight. I hope you come by and visit me. - I sure will, soon as I get time. - Located in downtown Vegas, everyone knows Tawny's Hideaway. - May I see you to your car? - Oh thank you, very sweet boy. [Jeepers whistling] - Boy, is that something else? That's intense, intense. - Uncle Woodrow won this barn in a dice game. I couldn't understand why he like it so much. - Maybe because it made him think of home. I guess that's one reason why I haven't gotten too homesick since I been here. - Promise you'll come by the club. - Soon as I get everything straightened up around here. Hi Boots, what are you doing coming to work so early? - Had some ideas I'd like to talk over with you. Hello Tawny, what are you doing out in the country? - Oh hello Boots darling. I thought it was about time to get acquainted with Woody. We're practically relatives you know. [door slamming] - You two kissing cousins enjoy yourself, I've got work to do. - That's the strangest woman I ever seen. - How is that? - I don't know, we haven't gotten along since I been here. Just haven't hit it off. - Possibly she's jealous of your taking over the club. She worked for your uncle quite a while you know before he passed away. - Naw, I don think that's it. There's something gnawing on her. And she just doesn't seem to want to talk about it. - Now that you're a land owner darling you're bound to inherit the troubles that go along with it. - I guess you're right. - I've got some things of your uncle's you may want. They're men's things he was proud of. I'll have my maid drop them off to you. - Oh no, you don't need to worry about that. I'll pick 'em up next time I come to town. - Okay Woody. - Is that a date? - See you later. - Okay. - Bye. - Good bye. [dramatic music] - Man, you meet every kind of kook in the world in the saloon business. - You're so special when you ain't got enough money to pay your debts with. - Eh, things'll get better. We just had a bad run of luck. - Bad run of luck? Uncle Woody just died and left too darn many bills to be paid. [engine rumbling] [upbeat music] If things don't get better, I'm gonna take this what's his name lawyer, Shackleford's advice and sign the darn place over to him. - It would be kind of nice to get back to Tennessee. [solemn music] - You ain't been on the phone to Sarah Lee lately have you? - Yeah. [upbeat music] - Yahoo! - Yahoo! - [Jeepers] Oh Aunt Clem. - Jeepers, it's good to see you boy. Woodrow. [laughs] My, you're looking fine boy. - [Woody] Thank you. - So this is the Las Vegas gambling hall huh? - [Woody] Yeah. - [Aunt Clem] It ain't very fancy. - Aunt Clem come on, I wanna show you around. - Oh. - Meet everybody. - All right. - Hey Al, this is Aunt Clem we been telling you about. - Pleased to meet you ma'am. - Well howdy. - Al is our bartender. - You're one of them mixologists I hear so much about on TV huh? - Yes ma'am. - Woodrow, you've come a long way to be able to afford hired help. - Yeah well Jeep, go get Aunt Clem's bags. Come on, I wanna show you where we live. - Oh, that's a good idea, 'cause we got a lot to talk about. That's the reason I rode that jet airplane all the way out here. [laughs] Oh land's sakes, don't those things whoosh your body along though? [laughs] You know I never knowed it to be so much fun. - You really did ride one of 'em. - Why sure I did. - You been further up in the air than most been away from home. [both laughing] - Oh Woodrow, you ain't changed a bit. I guess Uncle Woodrow wasn't the spendthrift I thought he was. - Oh, you don't know the half of it. - Hmm? - Well, what Jeepers means Aunt Clem, that we got a lot of things to talk about. - Oh well of course, the minute I received your phone call I put the wheels in motion. - [Jeepers] Oh, that's why you came. - Well, I saw her down the mount. I was lonesome, I wanted, well you know. - Oh well, you said you wanted some people you could trust. So first off I thought of Jake and Donald. I been trusting them for years. And I got to thinking of your club here and all. You know what you need here? Some show folks with names. So I checked around and, thank you Jeepers. You know I been booking country show people in our Grange Hall for more years than I care to remember. So I made a few phone calls, took my hog money out of the cookie jar, and here I am. - Oh excuse me, I didn't know you had company. - Boots, come here, I want you to meet somebody. You remember me telling you about Aunt Clem? - Yeah. - [laughs] This is her. Aunt Clem, this is Boots Malone. - Well, howdy girl. - Hello. - My, ain't you a pretty one though. - She's an entertainer, she works here. As a matter of fact, she's under contract to us. - Oh, that's what I forgot to do. Excuse me folks, with all the excitement and all, I plum forgot to tend to business. [laughs] I gotta call Nashville and confirm the rest of our entertainers. - [Jeepers] Who you getting Aunt Clem? - Oh, just some friends of mine. Knowed most of 'em all my life. Is this a dialing or asking phone. - It's a dialing phone Aunt Clem. All you have to do is just dial the operator and she'll get who you want. - Well, you just get laid out what you wanna do fixing up this place, while I'm making this phone call. And then you youngins scamper. I don't want you knowing my secrets. Might have to use my womanly ways on this man I'm calling. Now skedaddle. [Woody laughing] And let's see, from now on send all the bill collectors to me. Money is my department, and you and Boots get to working getting your show ready. Folks from Nashville'll just fit their acts right into your show when they get here. - Who all's coming Aunt Clem? - Never you mind who's coming. You just get to work cleaning this place up. It ain't fit for my hogs to live in. - Cleaning it up, I'm the manager, we can hire a cleanup man. - You're the manager and the cleanup man. Now we'll all get together and pitch in and help you. If we're gonna make this plan work, and justify the faith in them folks coming out from Nashville, we've all gotta pull together. - I don't know much about this country music, but I'll learn fast. - Woody tells me you know most all the folks here about. - Oh, I've lived in this town a few years. - Well, sit down Ms. Tawny. You know we're gonna need your help. - I wanna do everything I can. Woodrow started me in show business and I'd like to return the favor by helping Woody get started. - I understand you know all about gambling and such. - [chuckles] To own a club in Las Vegas, you'd better know about gambling and such. - Would you take over the gambling for us, on a partner basis? - I'll bank the tables and make sure the games are operated according to law. - Bless you gal, I hoped you say that. I'll say one thing for Woodrow, he sure knew how to pick smart women. - [laughs] Thank you Aunt Clem. - Well now wait a minute. What if somebody beats you at this gambling business and you have to take a loss. - I accept the loss, tomorrow's another day. - You know something, you and me'll make good partners. Too bad we didn't meet sooner. You think this country music idea will go over here in Las Vegas? - If the management is right and the entertainment good, it'll work. - I can guarantee you the entertainment will be the best in the country music business. - Woodrow always said you were a, how did he put it, a tough nut. - His exact words were probably tough old nut. Well, let's get to work. Where do we start? - Publicity, this town lives and breathes on publicity. - Well what town don't. [laughs] Only back home we call it gossip. [upbeat music] [audience clapping] Yahoo! [audience laughing] Well good evening friends. We've got a wonderful show for y'all tonight. And so to start off with, I'm going to just start by introducing my nephew Woodrow to you. And he's gonna come up here and tell you all about the wonderful folks we got coming here to visit with us.
