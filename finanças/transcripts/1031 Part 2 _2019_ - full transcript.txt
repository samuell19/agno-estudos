Good evening, my victims. It is I, Malvolia, the Queen of Screams. Remember me? The last day of October is upon us. That's right, today is All Hallow's Eve, which can only mean one thing. Welcome back to my Halloween Monster Marathon, where creatures lurk in the shadows awaiting trick or treaters to leave their houses and disappear into the night. But what happens when trouble does come about? Will everyone make it out alive? We can only hope they don't. Bye, honey. Have fun. Tell Karen I said hi. I will. Pick me up at midnight? Okay, just give me a call if you need me sooner. - Okay, love you. - Bye. I'd turn back if I were you. - Hey, happy Halloween. - Hi, Ms. Jacobs. Happy Halloween. Come on in. How are you, how's college? School's good. My mom says hello. Oh, I miss her at church. And work, work's good? You're still at the video store? Yeah, Play It Again Video. Be kind and rewind. That's pretty adorable. What is that, a birthmark? I never noticed that before. Uh, yeah. Kind of like a little triangle, I like it. Stan! Move your ass. Just grabbing my coat, fuck! Hello, Holly, blah, blah. Hi. Where's your makeup? I'm not wearing it. What? Jesus, fuck, I am not wearing it. All right, so we'll be back at 11:30 or midnight. The McLaren's phone number is by the phone. Okay. So, just call if there's an emergency. Tommy's in his room making a mask, so, he's still on that silent kick, just kind of be patient with him. Hey, sport. High five? Or not. Well, I've got a surprise for you. Snagged this baby from work, "Cannibalistic Humanoid From Detroit". 80's trash cinema for a price. Cameron gets to come over, and you don't tell your parents? You like Cam, right? Deal? Okay. I'll go make you a sandwich. And nothing will stand in my way. Trick or treat. Not in the house, you fucking retard. What are you doing? Oh, right, right. What, this sweet shit's expensive, okay. Oh, okay. It's done. The demo? Yup. This one? It's called "March of the Death Witch". What do you think? - Death Wish? - No. Witch, like Death Witch. Oh, so this is like death metal? No. - Or thresh metal? - No. This is black metal. Black metal, you know. Black, like in evil. They started doing it in Norway, and then we started doing it here, and it fucking kills. Yeah, totally. Um, why does it sound like it's recorded in the bathroom? I mean, it's supposed to, it's raw, you know, gritty. Yep, well. Hold that thought, I gotta give the little squid his dinner. Okay. Doesn't sound like it was recorded in my bathroom. She didn't get it. Nobody gets it. Right, Bill? Wait. Did you hear that? What? Turn off the music. Why? Turn off the fucking music. Okay, sorry. It sounds like it's coming from the basement. It's, I don't know, probably Tommy playing or something. No, he's in his room. I don't know. Tommy, you down there? It's probably just a raccoon, you know. Really? A raccoon did this? Come here, little fella. I got a sandwich for you. Ew. That's no raccoon. No. Come on, motherfucker! No! Don't, he's my friend. Tommy, who is this? He's my friend. I found him in the woods nearby. He was alone and needed some help. Do your parents know he's down here? No, they never come down here. They can't know, please. Well, we have to tell someone. He's lost, and there might be somebody out there looking for him. Are you fucking kidding me? Did you hear the sounds that thing makes? There's nobody looking for that thing. It's probably hopped up on something. Well, he can't stay down here, it's not safe. I'm gonna have to call your mom. Please. Please, don't. You're supposed to be quiet. No, not yet. Here, give me, give me, give me, give me. Hey, thanks for coming! Thanks for having us! Nothing. I guess we try the cops now? Tommy! What the fuck, dude? You're gonna be in big trouble, mister. Big trouble. We'll just drive to the McLaren's. What the fuck? Fuckin' swear to God he's gonna be the next Dahmer. If I were his parents, I'd beat his ass every fuckin' day. - What? - Aw, shit. - What? - I don't have my keys. Well, where are they? I don't know, I put them in my jacket, but they're obviously not there anymore. Well... Do you have them? I'm gonna fucking kill you! Cam, wait! You've gotta be fucking kidding me! I'm gonna kick your ass, you little shit! Give me those keys! Cam, let's just go, we can walk to the McLaren's. We're miles from anyone, okay? Where are we gonna go? Hey, he's coming around. Please, can we go? Cam! Baby, come on, get up. Where is that little kid? Please, get up, get up, get up. Baby, come on, come on. - Holly, watch out. - Let's go, we gotta go. Cam, Cam. Tommy, we are way past telling your mom! Where are you? It wasn't supposed to be like this! Tommy? Tommy? Cam? Cam? Oh, oh, oh baby, oh my God. Baby, I'm gonna need you to get up now, okay? We're gonna have to walk, we have to get out of here. Okay, can you get up? Are you... No, you're okay, it's okay, you're safe. Okay. Oh my fucking God, I don't even know what the fuck just happened. Holly. No! No, no, no! Please don't. No! Oh, God! Oh God, oh God. What are you doing? You weren't supposed to be here. Hey! Oh, God! What are you doing to him? Oh, God. Oh, God, no. Baby, please, no. No, no, no! He never eats the face. Oh, God! Help! Whoa, whoa, missy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay, settle down. All right? You're safe, you're safe, all right? Now, what's going on? He killed him. He's fucking dead. He's dead. Now slow down, okay? Slow down now. Take a breath, take a breath, all right? Now, a kid killed who? He killed my boyfriend. And then he fed him to that thing, I don't know what... It's okay. Let's get you somewhere warm, all right? Okay? What are you doing out here? I'm just looking for my dog. What? What the fuck? Please, please. What are you doing? Well, you saw it, didn't you? Isn't it incredible? Who are you people? I'm sorry, missy, but fate brought you here tonight. What... Wake up, little missy. You don't want to miss your special day. Hi, honey. How we doing, honey? Why? Don't be scared. You should only be excited, for you are a part of something so big. Your son, he had this thing, this creature in the basement. Creature? Oh, he's no creature, honey, he's family. He's been with us the whole time, for hundreds of years. And tonight is his night, for tonight is Samhain. You're fucking psychotic. All you people are psychotic. I'm truly sorry for your boyfriend. Cameron, was it? I mean, he seemed like a nice boy. A little too old for you, but a nice boy. But he shouldn't have been here tonight, though. You know the rules. I loved him. I know, honey, I know. And he served his purpose. But you are the main treat. You won't get away with this. My mom knows I'm here. Your mom's the reason why you're here, and we thank her for that. I don't believe you. Be strong, baby. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom, please, mom, help me. I always knew you were special. This is your birthright. Where you're going is gonna be so much better than this shit hole of an Earth. I promise. Mom, please! It's time. Tommy? No! Go get your brother. No! He eats once every five years. On tonight, in the last minutes of Samhain. And we gather to pay witness, for it is time. For it is time. Wait. Wait, no, no, he eats once every five years, he already ate. He already ate! Cameron was just a bonus. And maybe it was fate that brought him here tonight too, but in the last minutes, it's you, the marked one that counts. So, tonight he eats twice. And don't worry, that pretty face. He never eats the face. Why me? Why? Don't be scared, sweetie. No! No! No, God, please! Please, please, please! Someone help, please don't! No, please! No! No! Please, please someone, please help me. Please! No! Mom, please! Back off! Fuckin' back off! No, please! Please, someone please! Mom, mom! No! No! You bitch! God, dude, did you have to swerve around every frickin' street corner? Look, not to be an asshole, but I'm gonna have to leave you four stars. You still here? All right. One star it is then. Awesome. Happy Halloween. Yeah, Happy Halloween to you too, you fuckin' asshole. Well, it's that ghastly night once again, boils and ghouls. Geez, again with the puns? Not even original ones either? And here at 104.4 KRAS, your host, Chad the Krasshole himself, along with his trusty sidekick, Chet Chunkers. We will be trick or treating you to some bone rattling tunes all night long. Krasshole and myself are celebrating all Hollow seasons in spooky fashion, spinning some truly terrifying tunes... Hello? Hey! Where are you? I'm on the road. Aw, no, working? Yup. Halloween's good money. Halloween's not for making money, Halloween's for mood and atmosphere! Halloween is for chills, and spooks, and the grotesque. Halloween's not for making money. Well, every day's the same when you're broke, babe. You know what I'm gonna say. Broke is not a mindset. Broke is a mindset, Jeremy. Right, well, tomorrow's the first, and I can't pay bills with a mindset, so, it's the road for me. All right, well. Do you know when you will be home? Because I have a surprise for you. Okay, um, I have outfitted our apartment for Halloween shenanigans, but I'm not gonna tell you what I have planned. Jeremy? Please don't do this to me again. I'll be there, wait, just one more, okay? Okay. Good evening. You didn't see me? I sneak up on people. I guess you can call it a skill. I guess you could. Would you mind? What? Dinner got a little out of hand. 13 apples. I'm kidding. It's stained blood. Or is it? It is. I didn't have time to wash up. I'm running late, I've already gotten it all over my phone. Would you mind? Much appreciated. Pardon. Aren't you curious as to why my hands are blood soaked? Dracula was a blood sucker, right? Part of the costume, I assume. Being Dracula doesn't necessitate bloody hands. Why do you got blood on your hands? This little show that I was... This little monster mash put on by some actor friends and myself. Had all the classics. Frankenstein, his bride, The Mummy, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and of course, yours truly. Sounds a little hokey. It was violent, actually. Absurdly so. Comically, even. You see, the monsters in our little play have formed a council, and the nature of our meeting is to elect a president. Of course, all the creatures throw their hats in. The entire things descends into this wild brawl. All the creatures fighting with each other for the position. What a riot. Guess who won? Hey, Howard? Yeah? Do you mind sitting back a tad? For your safety. It was The Mummy. You can't kill what's already dead. Dracula's already dead, isn't he? Still feasts on the living. More alive than The Mummy. You ever been in a wreck? What's that? A car wreck. If you were to swerve off the road right now and hit a light pole, I'd probably be ejected through the front windshield. Happened to a friend of mine in college. Walked away unscathed. But the driver, on the other hand... I don't plan on having any accidents. I didn't say anything about an accident. Careful. He wanted to. What? My friend. He wanted to what? Wreck. He grabbed the car and twisted the wheel so it ran off the road. What a waste. Did you say something? He wanted out. Instead, he sent his friend on. You get that, don't you? The death drive feeling. Sure. Everybody does. If I'm staying near a ledge, or by a train. Everybody does, why is that? This species has a destructive instinct that extends to even their own survival. What do you make of that? I don't. Hm. Of course, suicide is different. What is that? Pardon? Are you eating in my car? Do you see any food? Why are you doing that? Doing what? The ventriloquism act, speaking, without moving your mouth. Are you impressed? No, it's unnerving. I guess you can call it another skill. You all right? You're leaking. Just part of the process. What? I'm dying, Jeremy. But for me, it's more like molting. So long as I secure a new vessel. Stop that. Stop what? Speaking with your mouth closed. Why? Visiting my head. I don't like it. What's in your head that you won't accept visitors? Where are we? Be at ease. Let me in. I'm so tired. Of what? What was that you were going on about? Molting? We're not on the road anymore, Jeremy. Where are we? In your mind. Sickening. Am I sleeping? No. Who are you? What I am is less important to you than where I'm going. Where I'm from is a distant place, far in space and time. The bright swell of light from my home's demise thousands of years ago is only now reaching Earth. But I don't mourn. I make new homes everywhere I go. I'm in very many places now. I've come so far, yet where I'm going next is very close. You're gonna kill me. We don't kill, we inhabit. Think of a flooded river rising towards a puddle along its bank. When they meet, the puddle no longer exists, but it's absorbed. You're gonna make me like you. We have to propagate. This body has grown weak for our means. You don't want me. I'm useless. Quit thinking of yourself. You would waste flesh, a body, brewing with potential. Give it to us. We would appreciate your gift, as we as Howards, and as friends. I'm using it. You're tired. You don't know what I am. We're already inside you. Among your thoughts and desires. You can't lie. We see everything. What kept you from following through? Am I dead? Did I fall asleep? Crash? Do you want to be dead? I don't know. Indecision plagues you, life torments you, cede it to us, until it stops. You're cowardly. Incapable of dealing with your own issues. We'll do all the work. Hello? Howard? This isn't your dream. It could be. Until then, this is my space. Same as I am in your thoughts. I'll share mine with you. You understand my proposal now. I can't. There are people... There is one hurdle. Do you have to see anybody? We'll save love. You can? It will be her choice, as it is yours now, but make it fast. We're fading. Soon we'll leave you to yourself again. Once you say it. Welcome to your Halloween haven. Complete with witchy company. Jeremy? Jesus, for a second I thought it wasn't you. Sorry, I'm just beat. Look at me? Come on. Where we're here, it's just the two of us. I'd like it if you tried. Just a really long day. A strange ride. Forget it. It never happened. Jesus, Jeremy. Pardon. What is that? A bit of residue. And what have you been eating? It's the other way around. Are you pulling a Halloween prank on me, babe? Something like that. You're cold. Something's not right about you. Jeremy took an out, decided to gift us this vessel. It's not quite your worst fear, sweetie, but it's adjacent. Jeremy left you with a pair of words scrawled in chicken scratch on the page. I'm so sorry. What happened to you? Visitor granted him his wish. He wouldn't. He wouldn't, he wouldn't... I can already see into your thoughts, you know that's untrue. Peer in the mind and find solace. You're an imposter. He was an imposter. This is far more genuine. Where'd you go? It's only us in here, Whitney. You need help. Attention, you must be... Should I show you what happened to me? Your grief compels you. Jeremy is gone. His body won't inhabit the same space as before, only helmed by foreign evidence. This beats seeing him every day. Perhaps pretending you're together still. But it'll be us, until this vessel's spent. For us, another chapter. For you, personal remade flesh. No reason to like this thing. Holding onto it like hauling dead epoch. Will you let me touch him? Hold him? Kiss him? Sleep with him? And know that every time you touch this body, you're being intimate with a dead thing. We're in your mind. We see how you carried him when he was already half dead before, resigned to give in. We could've shared our death card if you thought of me. Did it hurt? Trick or treat!

All right. Get the rest of the stuff, I'm gonna set up so we'll be all ready to pop! Oh, you ain't lying, baby. This will be the best God damn Halloween party ever. Ever! Rein it in, honey! Man, this place is creepy as hell! Where's all the dry ice and the Jack-O-Lanterns and shit? You're two hours early, Abe. Ah, nevermind. I'm here to help. Fuck, I'm excited. I'm ready to pound some beers, roast some mallows, and smoke some weed. Let's get this God damn bonfire lit. Rein it in, dude. Guys, guys, guys, guys. Who wants to hear a scary story? Yeah! All right. So, hundreds and hundreds of years ago in Indian times, feather, not red dot, this land here, ancient burial ground. All right? Scared place, and these spirits came out of it, and the blah, blah, blah, these people were killed, and murdered. This is a horrible fucking ghost story. All right, all right, so there was a burial ground, and people were murdered. But it didn't happen 200 years ago. It happened one year ago tonight. So there's a group of college co-eds, and they went camping in the woods, and they came upon a sacred site. You know, they could feel it in the air. And there was a totem of the Apache revenge spirits. Kanama, they called it. Anyway, so they started fooling around, and they were looking at all these arrowheads and everything, and that's when they saw it. It was a hatchet! Tomahawk. Yeah, tomahawk, yeah. A hatchet! Holy shit! She's just freaking out out there! The phone, the phone! Where's the fucking phone? There's no fucking phone in the cabin! I say we just let her lie there, and then she can sleep it off. He'll kill us all! Nobody's safe! We desecrated his ancestors! Killed them all! Rein in it, woman! Tell us what happened. Calm down, what is your name? My name is Sugar Crawford. We were out, I was assisting Dr. Julius Zyrk and his research. Nancy! I'm all out! You got anymore? I still have one egg left. So what are you waiting for, man? Let 'er rip. Well, I see their TV on inside. There might be people in there. So? So, what do you mean? What happens if they see us? I hope they see us. I don't want to get in anymore trouble. Besides, what happens if they're just cool and they just ran out of candy? Look, we're not the bed guys in this scenario. We're the heroes. Huh? We're out here on Halloween night risking our asses to protect tradition. These assholes know the rule. They've been on the other side of the door. It's Trick or Treat. Trick or Treat. One simple rule. And do you see any treats? No. It's our duty as the kids of Halloween to remind them of the rules that they appear to have forgotten. So, are you ready to do your part? Just give me the God damn egg! Get up there and ring the doorbell, Jesus. Wait, what? Where you goin'? Pussy! Trick or treat. Oh, you little shit. You better run! Babe, what the fuck. Did you not hear any of that? Hear what? Um, the sound of a psychotic hooligan kid attacking me with an egg at the front door. Ha! Told you when you were making that little sign that there are rules on Halloween. What? They're probably just enforcing the rules. This is a 20 dollar hazy. Are you kidding me? I'm getting attacked by Children of the Corn and you're worried about your beer? Aren't you gonna do something about it? Chase them down, kick some ass for me? Anything? Babe. I got you. I'm your ride or die. If anything, though, I should probably be thanking those kids. Asshole! Because, if it wasn't for them, then I wouldn't have this hot, naked ass right in front of me, begging to be worshiped. True. Nice recovery. But you're still an asshole. I have to get ready for this party. Come on, how about just a quickie. Otherwise I'm gonna have this boner all night just thinking about it, and you know these shorts aren't gonna cover it. I'll tell you what. You go clean the egg off the door, then maybe we can play one more round of Naughty Camper, Horny Counselor. Maybe. I am gonna clean the shit out of that door, and then I am gonna counsel the fuck out of you. Oh, God, thank you. God damn, I love Halloween. Oh, fucking shit, dude. Bro. Are you one of those guys that threw the eggs at my girl? I mean, it's okay, I get it. It's Halloween, whatever. Plus, kind of a big guy. What are you like, 250, 260? Okay then. Well, as you can see, we are "Sorry kids, no candy." That means we are closed for the night. All right. Seriously, bro. Get the fuck outta here. I've got some pumpkins to smash, if you know what I mean. Seriously bro, get the fuck outta here, you're starting to piss me off. Hotter than a campfire. Babe. We don't have time to play games. Seriously, we gotta go. Can I just blow you in the car on the way to the party? Hey, dickhead. My offer's about to get reduced to hand job in a second. What are you doing? Bye. Trick or treat. Aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating still? Duh. And aren't you a little too hot to be all alone on Halloween? As a matter of fact, I'm not alone. I'm babysitting an adorable little girl who's sleeping in her room right now, and in about an hour, when her parents get home, I'm heading straight to a Halloween party where I'm meeting my boyfriend. So what you're saying is that we have an hour to kill. I don't think so, kid. Look, you're pretty cute, and you already have that perfect mixture of confidence and asshole that just, ugh, really drive the girls wild, but you're too young for me, and like I said, I already got a man. Whatever. There's plenty of sexy nurses in the sea. And anyways, now that I know where you live, I have a feeling I'll be seeing you very soon. I don't live here, just babysitting. Remember? Don't waste your time, she's a prude. Are you at the party yet? Have you seen Brad? What's he wearing? Is it the doctor costume like I said? Jesus, chill out. What? You sound like a stalker! No. I just want to make sure he's there, and he's having fun. Not too much fun. Because then I'll have to cut his balls off with a pair of toenail clippers. Gross. I don't think that's even possible. It is. Well, it would take forever. When the hell are you gonna get to the party? Ugh, as soon as this little shit's weird ass parents get here. They said by midnight, but hopefully sooner. Ugh, they're old, and boring, and should be in bed already, and... Nevermind. Maybe they aren't as boring as I thought. Wait, what are you talking about? Nothing. I just found a drawer full of sex toys and weed. Uh, are you serious? Oh, yeah. I'm about to start my pregame, bitch. See you later. Why, hello there little fella. Let's see what you have up your sleeve. Oh, yeah. You and I are gonna be great friends. I can tell already. No, no, no. No way. ♪ She's right there with me ♪ She is mine, mine, mine, mine... Oh my God. You're a big son of a bitch, aren't you? I don't care. I saw her first! I got here first! I am first. And she is mine. ♪ A beautiful school queen ♪ I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong. She's mine. I have been watching her for weeks. All right. Maybe not weeks, but days. Days, and days, and days and... God damn it. Fine! A day, okay? One day. You happy now, you nosy son of a bitch! But it was a whole day. An entire day, today, but all day today. Since it got dark out. But that's still longer than you. You don't put any work into it, man. You just show up, like you own the place. But you don't, no. You don't own the place, and you don't own her. You know why? 'Cause she's mine! You're a tough guy, huh, yeah? A tough guy. You think you're better than me? Oh, well you're not. I am faster than you, I am smarter than you, I am a hell of a lot better looking than you, and I can outwit you so fast that your gross, ugly head will spin. Come on, man! I really need this. I have had a really bad week, and it's Halloween night, and she fits my profile perfectly. That doesn't always happen. You know how that is, right? I mean, you must have a type. Hockey player, or something? You're covered in blood already, you're like a rockstar. You have clearly had a successful night. So why don't you just go back to wherever it is you come from, and put your big boots up, and you know, loosen up the straps. Maybe sip a margarita, just relax. Just get your energy back, and just take a break, okay? You deserve that, my friend. Beat it, freak show! God damn it. Do you know how long it takes me to get ready every night? Huh, do you? Well, whose fault is that? Huh? Son of a bitch! And besides, like I've been saying all along, she is mine! Oh, shit. All right. Is that the best you've got? Oh, yeah, that's tight. Oh, yeah. You have very strong hands. All right, all right. All right, all right. You can have her, I was just kidding, she's all yours, you win. Ease up, man, all right? Come on, your hand's gotta be cramping by now. Hey. Hey, look. That guy. He's trying to steal your girl. God damn satanic worshipers. They fuckin' ruin everything. I hate them. Well, all right. Come on, big guy. I heard there's a high school party just a couple blocks away. We can go take out our anger on them. Well, I hope you're not in love, kid. Because she just lost her head over somebody else. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Hey, wait up! Do you guys know where that high school party is? Do you think there will be beer there? Do you know what butt chugging is? Do forgive Peter's denial and those who crucified you. Count on my transgressions, but rather my tears of repentance. Renew my iniquities, but more especially, my sorrows. I'm sorry, Papa. Undo me! Shit. I think that would be a great idea. Nevermind that, Sister Mary. Let's go. Aw, look at him, isn't he cute? Aw, there you go. Stop! I'm sorry. Well, my victims, that's all we have for tonight. Another monster marathon has come and gone. Sadly, we'll have to wait another year for another terrifying time. Oh. Did you not get the deadvite to the after party? Well, it is for deceased members only. Well, if you do choose to go out, be careful of who may be lurking around the corner. You never know what may steal the life from out of you.
