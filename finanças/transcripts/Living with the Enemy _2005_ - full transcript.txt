[ Tires squealing ] - I didn't pay $10 grand to be here and not meet Phillip Lauder. Set it up. - Thank you. Hi. Bev Wallach checking in. Yes, hi. I'm calling from VisTech to set up a meeting with our CEO Bev Wallach, with Mr. Phillip Lauder. Just a brief meeting? [ Sigh ] Thank you. - I'm going to take a shower. Unpack me. [ Shower running ] - Allison Connor again, for Bev Wallach. Well, does Mr. Lauder have anything? [ Sigh ] Completely booked. [ Sigh ] - I am not happy. - Non-fat, no sugar. - I'm heading to the conference. Hold down the fort. [ Birds chirping ] - On your left. - On your right! [ Both panting ] Oh my God! That was some run. You're in good shape. - You too. - Yeah, but you won. - I didn't know it was a competition. - OK, then I won. Woo! You got a name? - Allison. - Great views up here, Allison. - You haven't looked down once. - Oh yeah. [ Laughing ] - Ready for more or you still catching your breath? - Bring it on. I'm gonna wipe that gorgeous smile off your face. Why aren't you at the conference? - My boss is. I am busy fielding calls and trying to set up a meeting with Phillip Lauder. Can't you tell? - Interesting way of working. - I took one look at those trails and that was it. - Don't you want to learn everything there is to know about new technology? - Not really. I just want it to work. - I'm a complete Luddite myself. You've got a little ketchup... - Thanks. - Yeah, you got it. - I don't even know your name. - It's Paul. So, what makes you so sure your boss won't check in on you? - She's too busy trying to get her meeting with Lauder. Like that'll happen. - Why wouldn't it? - If you had a billion dollars, would you waste your time? - You have something against money? - Well, I wouldn't know from experience. I still don't know anything about you. - Well, that's the idea. - Come on, Paul. Tell me your deepest, darkest secrets. - I'm sure yours are far more interesting than mine. [ Door chimes ] Ah, they found me. OK, well, I guess this is goodbye. - So, you're a wanted man? - Yeah. Escaped lunatic. [ Laughing ] - Oh, no. That's OK. Winner pays, right? - Great. - You can get the next one? - You're on. - "Mr. Phillip Lauder requests the company of Ms. Beverley Wallach and Ms. Allison Connor for dinner tonight at 6pm in the main dining room." Good going. - Thank you. - You should have brought your own dress. - Maybe I shouldn't go. - No. Your name is on the invitation, so you're going. Either Lauder's being polite or his people don't realize you're just an assistant. Just keep quiet and smile. No, I'm serious. And whatever you do, don't mention Mr. Lauder's wife. - Why? What about his... - No. - May I? Thanks. - Ah! You're Allison and you're Beverley. - Mr. Lauder. - Houston Edwards. You'll find me two steps behind Phillip and to his right. - Sweetie, everyone knows this man's the business sense behind Cobalt. - That means I sign checks and smoke cigars. [ All chuckling ] Phillip is the visionary. - Hi. Phillip Lauder. - Bev Wallach. It's a pleasure. My assistant, Allison Connor. - Hi. - Hi. - Like any hi-tech entrepreneur, you... both you guys are my demi-gods. I mean, there's Bill G., but everyone's gunning for him. - They'd be gunning for me too if they could pick me out of a crowd. I know nothing about wine. But it's the only way I can get him to fill my glass. [ Laughing ] - So, are you enjoying the conference? - Well, I had a fantastic lunch meeting. How about you? Allison, isn't it? - Well, it's so beautiful here. It's too bad anyone has to work. - What she means is, you chose a fabulous place for a conference. - I don't know. Seems to me she's saying we picked a lousy place. - No, I was just... [ Clang ] - Ooh! I wouldn't worry about that. That dress doesn't do you justice. - Allison? What time is it? 'Cause you have those promo folders to stuff for tomorrow. - Right. I should go. - But you haven't eaten. - I had a big lunch. Excuse me. - That's some assistant you've got there. - Yeah. She's a good kid. Her mom died. She had to quit school to take care of her. She needed money, I needed help. My little charity project. - Hmm... - Eighteen recruits from the top computer science students in the country. All Phi Beta Kappa. All doing graduate level work. - What about that one kid? - Carl Branch? - Yeah. Language re-con boy. Yeah, that's him. His programming skills are brilliant. I want you to hire him. - We tried. Offered him mid-6. Kid wasn't interested. - He's starting his own company. - Says he'd rather piss glass than work for Cobalt. You know, we're Big Brother, blah, blah, blah. - Really... He could be a problem. - Excuse me, sir. This was returned. Ms. Connor won't be joining you tonight. - OK. What's next? [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] Allison? [ Knocking ] Allison? Hi. You didn't like the dress? - I loved the dress. - You have a boyfriend. This is a reversal for me. - What is? - Someone wanting to spend time with me before they know who I am. - Well, I didn't think it was right, given your situation. - I disagree. - What would your wife think? - Well, unfortunately she passed away. - Oh, God... I'm sorry. I didn't know. - It's OK. It was all over the news for like, 15 minutes. - I don't watch much TV. - What are you doing tomorrow? - That depends on Bev's schedule. [ Dialing ] - Hey, it's me. Do me a favour. Make sure Bev Wallach is in meetings tomorrow. All day. Good. Thanks. All right. I'll see you later. - OK. 'Night. Can they hear us? - You get used to it. Bev mentioned you lost your mother. - Yeah. Last year. I still can't believe it. - Your mom must have been quite a woman. She raised a princess all by herself. - Yeah, she was. She was. She used to tell me, "think with your head, not with your heart." Not that she ever could. Back in Idaho we led these whitewater rafting trips. Worked a resort... It was kind of paradise. What's that look mean? - I'm just trying to figure out why I feel this way. - Oh, you shouldn't. - I promise to abide by the law once we're married. - Oh, you're a bit cocky. - Why? You wouldn't marry me? - I've never met anyone like you. - I got it just right. - What? - That dress. It fits you exactly. - How did you guess? - Thorough analysis. I was very motivated to solve the problem. - What are you pondering now? - One of my favourite musicians named a great song after you. - Elvis Costello. "Allison"? - Yeah. How did you know that? I thought you'd be too young to know that. - My mom named me after that song. - Really? - So every night someone lights a fire for you and makes you dinner, pours you champagne. - No. Not the champagne part. I usually pour it myself. - What's it like never having to do anything you don't want? - We all do things we don't want. - I guess. - You don't believe me? - It's a little tough to have sympathy. - I'd be lying if I said I wasn't the luckiest man alive. Everyday we're shaping the future. It goes beyond anything I ever imagined for myself. What about you, beautiful? What excites you? - Nothing to compare with what you just said. I mean, my life is pretty simple. - Yeah, well, try me. - Um... Hot dry days. Steep trails. Rough rides. That moment where your feet touch the ocean. That look. - Allison Connor... Best thing out of Idaho. - Mr. Lauder. - Yeah? - You've been described as a savant. How do you determine when an idea is worth pursuing? - Good question. There's a weighing of the market for any given product. Its potential to be revolutionary. Of course... All the research in the world can't take the place of gut instinct. - Carl Branch? - It might sound primal, but most of the time you just know you have to act on it, go for the kill. OK, I'll take one more. Yeah? - Given your track record I think we'd all be interested to know what are you most excited about nowadays. - Well, not what you might think. Hot dry days, steep trails, rough rides... That moment your feet touch the ocean. Ultimately, I believe that technology should work with nature, not against it. OK, it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. [ Applause ] - Where were you last night? - That's my business. - If you're doing Phillip Lauder then it's my business. Oh, God. He's a huge contact. I brought you here to assist me, not to act like an escort service. - Bev. Please. Phillip and I have feelings for each other. - You think he cares about you? You don't think he's with a different girl every night? So what's the plan? [ Helicopter ] When do you see him again? Yeah. Let it be a lesson. Start packing. I want to be out of here by noon. - Excuse me. Sorry. - Hi. - Hello. - Um, have you seen Phillip? - I'm so sorry, darling. His helicopter just lifted off. Can I pass on a message? - Yeah. Um... Tell him that Allison said goodbye. And that he's a jerk. - When we get back it's going to be non-stop. I'll need you to work the weekend. Look, a man's not going to save you. Lauder using you like that? It's disgusting. - Can you please not mention him? - Sure. - Houston told me you were upset. Now, I know you're just a kid but I thought you were smart enough to see that I'm in love with you. I thought you might love me too. - I do. Where were you? - I had to stop and do a little shopping. - Oh my God! Phillip! - Come on. I thought we'd get married in the French Alps. Ever been? - No. - Oh, I want to show you something. - Your parents? - Yeah. It's the day they eloped. It's a huge scandal for the Lauders. Mom was Irish Catholic and broke. - Like me! - Is it too fast? - No. - Good. Because your life's about to change. - Are you trying to scare me? - No. I just want you to be happy. - Well, as long as I'm with you, I will be. Besides, life's always changing. - Not like this. When enough money is involved there's no way things can be normal. Through the doorway, into the further space where the movement was so big it contained bonds and constraints and labours, and still was complete liberty. She was the doorway to him. He to her. - D.H. Lawrence's The Rainbow. You remembered what book I was reading. - Of course. You're my princess now. - Hmm! Do you have somewhere you have to be? - I have to go back to work. You should be flattered. I haven't spent 4 days away from Cobalt in over 20 years. - Is this what you meant about things changing? - You can stay on if you want to. I'm sorry, darling. I should have warned you, but I didn't want to spoil the mood. - You're forgiven. - Your bag will be packed for you. All you have to do is step out and a helicopter will take us to our jet. - Anything else? - Two things. One, trust me and not the lies of others. And two, from now on you're a target. How do you like your new home? - I don't believe it! Do people really live like this? - You do. My sister Tanya has run the place for years. She used to be at Cobalt until she burned out. Now breeding horses is her real passion. Don't let her scare you. - Phillip! She's gorgeous! I'm Tanya. Your new sister-in-law. - Hi. Allison. It's good to meet you. - You have the board meeting. - I'll see you later tonight. You sure you'll be OK? - Yeah. - She just married a multi-billionaire. I think she'll be fine, brother. - What Tanya means is that she's very happy to spend my money and she thinks you will be too. - Come. See your new home. - So I hear you love horses. We have that in common. - I doubt it. This isn't like life with Mom, rafting on the Snake River rapids. - How did you know that? - The day you met Phillip, I was faxed your complete file. You had a full ride at the University of Michigan. Junior year you shacked up with that Olympic skier Clay Reagan. You dropped out just short of graduating Suma in English. No criminal record. Perfect health. Except for your allergy to shellfish. - This is crazy! The day that we met? - My brother is a very powerful man. We have to take precautions. - Mr. Lauder asked me to give this to you. - "Hi, Princess. Meet Mystic. She's a prize-winner, and she's all yours." - She's a good girl. You're going to have fun with her. - They'll be plenty of time to play with the horse later. Let's go. - Who was that? - Stable girl. The staff is here to serve you. I wouldn't make friends. The Allison suite. Remodelled in your honour. - You didn't have to. - Monique had her own suite. Phillip wanted you to get the same. - Monique? - Phillip's late wife. - I don't need my own bedroom. - Phillip has huge responsibilities. It's selfish to make demands on his time. You're going to have to take a number to see him. -Hello? - Separate bedrooms? - Darling, I don't sleep! I'm on the phone at 3:00 a.m. I doze maybe 2 hours a night. That room is so that you can avoid my weirdness. You don't have to use it. All right? We'll be together every night that we're in the same city. - And we sleep in the same room? [ Static ] [ Beep ] [ Knocking ] - Morning, Mrs. Lauder. Roger Kern, head of security. Would you come with me, please? Rule number 1, 2, and 3. Never leave the ranch without an armed bodyguard. Roger Kern! [ Beep ] We've got cameras throughout the premises, with a few exceptions. We don't monitor Mr. Lauder's bedroom or any of the bathrooms. We've got info on everyone here. Fingerprints, retinal scans, DNA. - Huh! - Is something funny? - It's just a little extreme. - All due respect... Do you know what happened to the previous Mrs. Lauder? - Well, she died... - She was kidnapped, from inside the ranch. Mr. Lauder paid a $50 million ransom. And she was later recovered... dead. Our first goal is to keep Mr. Lauder and his family safe. Right now, let's get you into the database. - [Computer]: Fingerprint. Voice sample. - Allison Lauder. -Retinal scan. - Map of the ranch. Master key. A manual of do's and don'ts. In a couple of weeks it'll all be second nature. -Process file. - Our annual charity party's next weekend. Most of our guests will be looking at you under a microscope. You're the hostess. - OK... What am I supposed to do? - Just try to have fun. Got a present for you. It's a global tracking device so I'll always know where you are. - You know, I didn't have much before but at least I had privacy. - Well before, no one could put a dollar value on your life. - Phillip, I found out what happened to Monique. Why didn't you tell me? - She's dead. What more do you need to know? I'm sorry. Can you understand how I may not want to talk to my sweet new wife all about how the last one died? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. - All that matters... is that we're together. I just want you to feel safe. Be happy. OK? ♪♪ I just can't understand ♪ What's happening to me ♪ It all seems so unreal ♪ 'Cause all we can do is pray ♪ Life without you is vain ♪ 'Cause all we can do is pray ♪ Life without you is vain ♪ You forget chaos! You can't predict the exact behaviour of a wide system n steps into the future without simulation of each step! Pardon me, monsieur. Nanotech is a footrace I don't plan to lose. Now you morons just set us back 6 months! One more stupid mistake, I pull the plug. Au revoir. - Excuse me. Where are all my clothes? - Miss Tanya said to throw them away. - [TV]: My next guest... - Tanya! Don't ever touch my stuff again. - I was only trying to help. - I've been dressing myself since I was 4. I don't need your help. - Well... Here's the plan for today. - What I plan to do is get new clothes. Hi. I didn't catch your name. I'm Allison. - Oh. Christina. - Mrs. Lauder... - Any chance you want to come shopping? - Sure. - The limo's waiting. - How do you get here? - I take the train. - We'll take the train. - That shop across the street has cute clothes and great prices. I guess that's not an issue. - I can still appreciate a bargain. I'll be right back. - OK. - So she's nothing like Monique, huh? - Not at all. - Poor Monique. The whole thing made me sick. - It was horrible. - Well, it didn't have to happen though. - What do you mean? - It's so obvious! Phillip didn't want Monique back. Everyone knows the king gets what he wants. - Yeah, um... We shouldn't be talking about this. - Ah! The lady of the hour! Come in, my dear. I need a word with you. - [Tanya]: I have to go. - Always a pleasure, T. - What's up? - Please sit down. Well now, this is a bit awkward. As you probably know, Phillip and I go back 20 years. So I know a good deal about your husband. He's generally right, but often impulsive. He didn't mention a pre-nuptial agreement, did he? - I don't see how that concerns you. - Well, it does. By failing to protect himself, Phillip puts the whole company and many employees at risk. - Maybe he trusts me. - Of course he trusts you. However, in this type of situation pre-nups are so much the norm that not signing one is borderline insanity. - This type of situation? - A disparity of wealth. This is the agreement Phillip's attorneys drafted for him to give to you. Obviously, he didn't. But I think he should have. This agreement, if anything should happen to him, leaves you very well fixed. - Look, this isn't some sort of scam, if that's what you're thinking. - This is a photograph of Phillip's first wife. Jennifer Getz. - No. He was married once to Monique. - No. Twice. He and Miss Getz tied the knot in Vegas after ComDex, 1979. They were young programmers. They had a bit of a rivalry going. After the split, she wound up with nothing. He got Cobalt. If she had signed the pre-nup... she'd be worth over $10 billion. Instead... she's answering phone calls when servers crash. - I can't believe he didn't tell me this. - He'd be very embarrassed if you brought her up. I hope you'll think about it. - I will. Seems like everyone around here knows more about my husband than I do. - What do you mean? - I found out that Phillip was married before Monique. - Oh, that programmer? - That's what I mean. - I think it lasted like, a weekend or something. - There's something else. I... I overheard you and the cashier talking yesterday. - I'm sorry. - Well, what do you think she meant? "Maybe Phillip didn't want Monique back"? - Oh, you'll be fine. - What do you mean by that? - You and Monique are night and day. She could be a bitch. - Did she and Phillip not get along? - Really shouldn't be talking about this. - Please. I need a friend here. - Well... Monique would argue with him. From what I've heard, if you get him mad, you don't get a second chance. - Excuse me, what's in that room? - Storage for the late Mrs. Lauder's belongings, ma'am. - Oh. Thanks. - [Tanya]: You can't possibly be finished. Have you cleaned in here? What about the windows? - I already did them, ma'am. - Hi, this is Allison Lauder calling for Stuart Wilson. Mr. Wilson, hi. I'm calling about Monique. Hello? [ Dial tone ] Hello? Hi. I need you to do me a big favour. - Sure. - OK. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Who knows you're here? - Nobody. - Do you know what attorney- client privilege is? It means that I can't discuss my client with you. - Monique was very secretive about her appointment with you. Scheduled for the day that she turned up dead. I think my husband might want to know that. I'll go tell him right now. Good afternoon. - Monique retained me for her divorce. She wanted out of her pre-nup. She wanted half. We made a meeting, obviously she didn't show up. - I found this with your business card. - It's not mine. A little word of advice: Enjoy the money. Don't ask questions. - Cheryl Cummings, FBI. - What do you want? - It's odd. Married less than a month... already consulting a divorce attorney? What prompted the visit? - I just wanted to talk to a lawyer. - I was the lead investigator into Monique Casimer's death. It's my belief your husband staged his wife's kidnapping in order to have her killed. - What does this have to do with me? - Monique told your lawyer, Stuart Wilson, that she had something big on Cobalt. Some evidence she could use to sway the pre-nup. A week later she's dead. You see a connection? - She was a major target. - She was a major threat. Whatever she found was enough to get her killed. Now, we have theories on your husband's criminal activity. But we don't have evidence. That's where you come in. - I don't follow. - Lauder Ranch is a fortress. But you're there. You can re-trace Monique's steps, you can be very helpful to our case. - Are you asking me to give you evidence against my husband? - I'm not asking. If you don't co-operate, you'll be an accomplice to murder. - How do you know I won't tell Phillip? - You tell him, you disappear. Same as Monique. You leave him, he grows suspicious, you disappear. You become a threat. Your instinct is to protect your husband, a man you've known less than a month. Think with your head, not your heart. - Look, if you're trying to scare me... I love my husband! - You either work with us and gain immunity or you don't. And when we catch up with Phillip Lauder you face criminal charges. Regardless, your life as you know it is over. Call me. If something doesn't feel right, trust yourself. - Mrs. Lauder. Have a seat. Where did you go in town? - Just had lunch. Looked around. - Have a good time? I understand the ranch can be restrictive. You're a young girl, just want to have a little fun. It must be hard for you. Maybe lonely even, with Mr. Lauder working all the time. What's in the bag? - Candy. - I have an awful sweet tooth. May I? I didn't mean to scare you. Look, it's my job to keep you out of harm's way. And it's your job to keep us appraised. But if this happens again I'll have to tell Mr. Lauder. He'll view it as a lapse, and... I like my job. Let's get you back to the ranch. [ Printer humming ] - Allison? Hey. - Hi! - What are you doing? - Uh... I wanted to surprise you. You didn't have a picture of us in here. I know you're swamped. I'll let you go. - Aren't you forgetting something? - I don't think so. Phillip? - Yes, darling? - I was wondering... How is it for so long Cobalt's managed to stay on top? - Well, we hire the best, we've had good luck, great ideas... But mainly it's constant vigilance and maintaining a standard of excellence. - That sounds rehearsed. - You caught me. I get asked that question all the time. It's a standard Cobalt response. - So, what's your response? Why are you always first to market? - My motto is "anticipate and acclerate". I take a guess at the next big thing and then I go after it before anyone notices. Kind of like how we met at the registration. - We met on the trails. - Well, technically, yeah. But I first saw you at the registration. I noticed 100 guys doing double takes and I had to find out who you were. - So you arranged to meet me? - I figured I would stop in at whatever panel discussion you were hitting. But then I heard you went for a run, so I decided to chase you down on the trails. [ Gasp ] - I thought that we met by fate. - Fate works better when you're prepared. - Hmm. - We fell in love. What does it matter how me met? Where are you going? [ Footsteps ] Calm down. - You acted like you'd never seen me before. You completely manipulated me. - Men chase beautiful women. You know that. It was just a smarter version of finding out what a woman likes to drink and having it sent over. - Everything and everyone is a game to you. - No. Not you. - How would I know? You're completely capable of hiding the truth from me. - Look, I know you're upset. You feel tricked. - Only about the most important thing in my life! - I'm sorry. - I going to sleep in my room tonight. - [Answering machine]: Hi. It's Bev! Um, I'm in town. I'm taking you to lunch, and no arguments. You look 5 years older, in a good way. Did I mention how much I like your outfit? - Twice. - So um, will you be working? I guess, why would you, really? - After I finish school. I plan on going back in the Fall. - Oh. He's letting you do that? - I don't need a permission slip. - Right! [ Laughing ] - So, you haven't even told me why you're in town. - I'm so sorry for all those awful things I said. You really were a doll. - Are you OK? - Go to the ladies' room. - What? - Just do it, please. - You know where to find me. - Allison. I enlisted Bev to bring you out here so we could talk. - About what? - You've got information for me. - I told you that I would contact you if I had anything. - The camera loves you. So, what was in the envelope? - Paperwork. It was the divorce contract Stuart Wilson was drafting up for Monique. I'd better go. - Not yet. - Oh my God! - Wilson. They found his body soon after you talked to him. Now, you're sure you don't have anything to tell me? Allison, you're in danger. I can help. Come with me. You should be in protective custody. - I have to go. - Mrs. Lauder? Your bodyguards left with Miss Wallach. They asked that you leave with these gentlemen. - Are you FBI? Look, I told Agent Cummings I didn't want to go with her. - Little Idaho nature girl. Didn't know who Phillip Lauder was, some crap like that. What does a billionaire's wife fetch nowadays? - Could be worth $60 mil. - Who do you work for? - Just enjoy the ride. - Look familiar? - This is where they found the body. - Beaten past recognition. - Poor Monique. She was a beautiful woman. - Hmm-hmm. I wonder what it was that killed her? The beating? Or the garroting? - Dunno. She's quiet. - Hmm. Quiet is good. It means she can keep a secret. Tour's over. - You looking for this? I took the tracking chip out. It wasn't much of a present, really. Beautiful. - Just give me a minute. - Sure. [ Door closes ] - We just missed the turn-off. - There is no dinner party. - What's going on? - It's a surprise. I planned a weekend getaway. - Oh... - We need some time alone, just the two of us. - I didn't bring any clothes. - A bag was packed for you. - I have things scheduled. - Tanya took care of it. Just relax. Welcome to my hideout. - Where's he going? - Oh, we'll be safe without him. See that button? It brings the police in less than 10 minutes. Yep. Two days of just you, me, and nature. - What...? - Power failure. Come on. Finally found a way to get you alone in the dark! Don't worry, I wired this place myself. Here, hold this. - OK. Oh, here it is right here. There we go. I like nature, but with electricity. After you. - I think I'll say good night. - That's a good idea. Let's go to bed. - I'm really tired. - It's for us, this weekend. - I know. We'll have a great time tomorrow. Promise. [ Dialing ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Footsteps ] [ Door closing ] [ Dialing ] [ Beeping ] [ Dialing ] - We're too far out. Your phone won't work here. There's no signal. When you're ready, I think we need to talk. [ Door closes ] - I'm ready. - Allison, I need to know what's pushing you away from me. See, I don't have as much time left as you do. And I have never felt this way about anyone before. - What about Monique? - Monique was a mistake. I felt more for you in 5 minutes than I did for her in 6 years of marriage. - So why didn't you leave her? - I have a hard time accepting failure. - And so she disappeared. - It's not how it seems. I did everything I possibly could to get her back. I paid the ransom. I co-operated with the FBI. I did everything I possibly could. I wanted her out of my life, but I didn't kill her. I would never kill anyone. When you strip away the business and the money and everything I'm just a programmer. I mean, I was a nerd before the word existed. I'm a nerd who is deeply in love with you. [ Birds chirping ] [ Clanging ] - Ow... What's going on? - Brunch. - Oh! - I had the chef prepare this for us. - Um, I just have to go clean this first. - Did you find the peroxide? - Uh-huh. - Do you need some help? - I'll be right out. - You like it? [ Coughing ] Allison? [ Coughing ] [ Alarm ] [ Alarm ] You really scared me there. It turns out the chef wasn't aware of your allergy. There was shellfish in our crepes. - I want to apologize for what happened. I should have informed the chef. It was a simple oversight. It won't happen again. - These are keys to a new house I just bought for you. Because that's where you're moving after the party. - Here's some more flowers. - Oh, great. Just put 'em over here. All right, darling. I'll let you rest, OK? - OK. Christina. I need your help. - OK. Detective Cummings, please. When do you expect her? No, no. No message. - Visiting hours, I'm told. Feeling better? - A bit. Our boy's all torn up. Thinks you don't love him anymore. I told him he's a damn fool. He's a different man. Frankly, better, since you've been around. So, you have to take care of yourself. He'll need you at the party tomorrow. - It's Mrs. Lauder. I'm going shopping. Morning. - Morning, Mrs. Lauder. - Is my limo ready? - You're not cleared to leave the ranch until the doctors approve. - What? - If you'd like, we can get Mr. Lauder on the phone. - No, that won't be necessary. - Hey! You're up and about! - Yeah. Will you take a walk with me? OK. Cobalt's been paying to eliminate the competition. Literally. They've got this secret fund. It's linked to half a dozen murders and arson... An explosion... Monique was putting the whole thing together and then she was killed. - But the kidnapping? - It was fake. She was wearing a one-of-a-kind necklace the day that she disappeared. I found that necklace in Phillip's cabin. They took her there, probably to kill her as soon as she found out what was going on. I was planning on telling Agent Cummings. - You think they know that you were trying to contact her? - Probably. If I wasn't a threat before, I am now. Security won't even let me go shopping. - We've got to get you away from here. - The party. I need you to have Mystic ready to go at 7:30. You put this in her saddlebag along with Monique's necklace. You'll find it in Phillip's cabin. - You feeling up to this, beautiful? - Of course. [ Chatter ] Thank you. - Hello there, beautiful. Too bad I have to fly off later tonight. - We'll just have to wait. I'd better go mingle. - Nightingale's headed inside. I want a visual on her ASAP. - Allison! I'm so glad to see you're feeling better. I was hoping for a dance. - Actually, I'm not feeling that great. I was just heading upstairs. - I'm sorry. Would you like a doctor? - No, no. I just need some rest. - Hey... Where is Allison? - Flirting with Houston. Where else? - You're drunk. I asked you, where is Allison? - Lighten up! - Allison? - I asked you a question. Why is Mrs. Lauder's horse saddled up? - I was just about to take her out for a ride. I know I'm not supposed to... - This horse has been out already tonight. As I recall, it was your I.D. card Mrs. Lauder used to sneak off the ranch. [ Horse neighing ] South grounds! Near the stables! Let's move! - Hey. You'd better hurry. - Thank you for everything. Take this. Take a paid vacation immediately. - Go! Good luck! [ Beeping ] - Hang on. - Is something wrong? - No. I'm going to need you to cover for me for a little while. Allison? Allison? - Don't worry, sir. We'll get her. - Sir, it's about Mrs. Lauder. She knows everything. Stay where you are! - We can take care of her, sir. You should get back to the party. - No, I'll handle this myself. This tranquilizer dart, who authorized that? - What tranquilizer? Oh! - Argh! Oh... [ Owl hooting ] - You didn't know? - Of course not. How long have you known about it? - Two weeks. - Why didn't you tell me? You thought I was involved. - I thought that you had to know. I accessed the spreadsheet on your computer. - There's over a million files in that database. How did you... - Monique's stuff. She was going to use everything against you in the divorce. What? - We'll have to assume they'll kill us now. - [Houston]: Yeah. OK, I'll be right there. - Hey, mister. - Hey, T. What do you want? - I thought we could have a drink, like old times. - There's a glitch with the product launch. I have to go. - I'm sure that it can wait. - No, it can't wait. I have to go. You left your party early. You snuck away to the cabin. There was an accident. The woods can be a dangerous place. - First Monique, now the two of us? Who's going to believe that? - Oh, there may be some talk. There was talk before and we made it go away. - You're a sick man. - I love you like a brother, Phillip. I don't want this. - If you think I'm going to approve of your decision to kill innocent people you're insane. - No, no, no. I'm loyal. I made sure each act was unique. Always at a key point in our evolution yet random enough to seem undetectable. - They were kids! - They were threats. My job was to grow this company and I succeeded beyond anyone's dreams. Thousands of people rely on us. Millions of shareholders. This nation's economy, for God's sake! That had to be protected. - I thought we won on ideas. [ Chuckling ] - God, man! You're worth north of $40 billion dollars as of close of market today. No one gets to $40 billion on ideas alone. There is always a trail of blood. - And I guess that's where you come in. [ Chuckling ] - See? She's the reason you're here. Your little Nancy Drew trophy wife. She's the reason I have to say goodbye to you, buddy. I hope she was worth it. Make sure they're dead, then torch the cabin. [ Car starting ] - That's kerosene. [ Thud ] - Good job. - We have to get out of here. This place is like a tinder box. - Could I have your attention please? Good evening. Thanks to your generous contributions and matching donations from the Phillip Lauder Foundation we've raised $4 million this evening! [ Applause ] You should be proud of the difference you've made to so many people's lives. To you. - [All]: Cheers! - I'd also like to propose a second toast. To... To Phillip Lauder and his lovely new bride. Unfortunately, Phillip and Allison had to leave early today. But he asked me to pass... To pass along his... - I had planned on being in San Francisco tonight to promote Cobalt's latest release. However... circumstances have caused me to... reevaluate my priorities. My new wife and I are going to take a honeymoon. - No, you're not. [ All gasp ] - Houston... just drop it. It is over. - Houston, you listen to me. You think about it. You kill Phillip, you destroy everything you work for. The stock, the legacy... Without Phillip, Cobalt is nothing. - [Cop]: Put the gun down! - I'm sorry. - Whoa, whoa... So, where to? - Anywhere.
