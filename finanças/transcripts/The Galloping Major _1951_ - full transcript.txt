[Music playing] [chatter] [music playing] NARRATOR: Sometimes in the very heart of London, the persevering explorer will stumble upon a quiet backwater, recalling the days when the busy capital was but a village. Lambs Green, how tranquilly rural it sounds. [Loud factory sounds] The ponies and traps, and the lambs themselves may have been displaced in the ruthless march of progress. But the modern inhabitants are still, to this day, a closely knit community, sharing week-by-week, their simple joys and pleasures, bound together in single-minded sympathy by their sorrows, and in their fond hopes. Yes, Lambs Green still has its green. Of course, among modern comforts and conveniences, there is no longer merry dancing round the Maypole. But the village green still attracts its visitors. And there is still the same warm welcome for the passerby. And for the villagers themselves, each day begins with a friendly greeting. [Bird squawks] Morning, Soldier. [Monkey chatters] Morning, Harry. Morning, Joe. Good morning, Sir. Arthur Hill, widower, owner of Lambs Green pet stores? Yes. Ooh, terrible smell in here. Just my luck, can't stand animals. In that case, what can I do for you, Sir? It's all written down there. Permission to enter said premises and to seize all that in them is, with the exception of wearing apparel, bedding, and the tools and instruments of the judgment to debtor. Will you please tell the person that sent you that I pay my debts. And there's no need for this sort of thing. [Animals squawk] I'm very glad to hear it, Sir. I don't fancy staying here. Staying here? Don't be absurd, Man. Come back later. There's a good man. Oh, my daughter-- come back later. Please go. Not without 34 pounds seven and eight. Daddy, you're not buying more animals? No I'm not, not buying any more animals. Now run along, Darling. Then what does he want 34 pounds seven and eight pence for? I know. It's what we did owe James and Pike. It's what you do owe them. Daddy, you promised. Horses again. Will you take 16 schillings? No, 15 and thruppence on account. Wait here. [Music playing] Hm, horses, eh? Would you mind minding your own business? All right, all right, no need for unpleasantness. I was only thinking that if we could have lived together, we might as well have something in common. [Music playing] Mind your step, Sweetheart, always getting in the way. What's up? Goldfish on fire? Ha. [Music playing] Oh, good, I thought I was going to miss you. Well, mate, I though I was going to hit you. Bill, have you got my money on you? Yeah, what about it? I want it. What, now? But what about your bike? Please, Bill. All right, mate, it's your money. Here we are, 15 and thruppence. Here we are then. [Music playing] Aye. Some girls have all the luck. [Music playing] Daddy, I've got-- [puppies whining] [animals chattering] Hm? Nah. Hm. Ah. Darby the Third, hm? No, Irish Jig. No, no, he's got a stare. Montana Miss, now there's a stare. Don't make me laugh, Montana Miss. Daddy, I've got the money. I wouldn't mind owning it. She couldn't run a race in 1,000 years. Daddy, 15 and thruppence. No, run along, Darling. Run along. We're busy. And I want a receipt too. I know, [inaudible]. Daddy, the money, look. Hm? Sue, how did you get that money? It's mine. I was saving it up out of housekeeping. I was going to buy a bicycle. Oh, thank you, Darling. You keep it. One of these days I'll buy you a spanking bike. You see if I don't. But, Daddy, what about the bill from Jones and Pike? Yes, what? Well, Mr. Temple will very kindly he's going to-- aren't you? That's all right, Miss. Don't you worry about that bill. With your dad's knowledge of horses and thanks to my last client, we'll have made enough money by this evening to buy up the whole of Jones and Pike. Daddy, you always said betting was a mug-- mug's game. Yes, I know, Darling. But sometimes, sometimes you find an absolute certainty. Montana Miss? Yeah. Huh. That's right, Montana Miss. She could have won the Derby on three legs. But the owner knew what he was doing. He was saving her up especially for the 2:30 this afternoon. [Chatter] Montana Miss, there's the winner. Don't let's go over all that again. She's been beaten twice by Irish Jig. Oh, form isn't everything. But I know a horse when I see one. Now look, you've won us 35 pounds so far. And this race is my tab. Get the best price you can on Irish Jig. Oh, she's beautiful. There's no such thing as a certainly in racing. I'd settle for her. Here, five pounds, put it on Irish Jig. Irish Jig, all right. And the man said she could have the Derby, but they were saving her up till this afternoon. How So you save a horse? Oh, look at you, messy. What was the name again? Montana Miss. Here it is. It's in the 2:30. Top of the tip packs-- I can always use a bit of extra cash. NEWSPAPER VENDOR: "Star News," "Standard." Hello, Gorgeous. Hello. Here, I've finished with these. Oh, ta, very much. I can curl up with these for hours. I'm a terrible bookworm. Here, why don't you just have a bit of good? Montana Miss, 2:30. Hot tip straight from the owner. Oh, thanks. Yeah, it suits you, that curly bang. Oh, I don't know. Suits you, that curly bang. So what? She gave me a good tip, didn't she? Huh, it'll go down. Now, it's all right. You got me through the queue Monday. Here, Montana Miss, 2:30. Not on your life. I'm telling you that, a special girl across straight from this table. (SHOUTING) "Star News" or "Standard." 15 bob on the nose Montana Miss, 2:30. Half a quid with Montana Miss. I'll have a tenner on Montana Miss. Save it, Sonny, buy yourself a lollipop. (SHOUTING) Store News or Standard. Blimey, what is this? (SHOUTING) Montana Miss-- "Star News" or "Standard." "Standard." 20, Montana Miss. 20, Montana Miss. How fast is the Irish Jig? Irish Jig, four pound for three, 125. - That's 16. - What? 16. Two pounds, Dickie Wig. The bet's 16, Montana Miss. The bet's 16 Montana Miss. Montana Miss. Bernie, do you still want your paper? Huh? I'll give you a penny for it. Done. Montana Miss? "Evening News." Montana Miss? Aye, aye, queue in all prices. [Laughter] Bet [inaudible] 24 pound and six, Dickie Wig, Dickie Wig. 24 pounds and six, Dickie Wig. [Inaudible] 20 pounds to five, Irish Jig. 20 pound to five, Irish Jig, 122. [Inaudible] Montana Miss. The bet 10, Montana Miss. A bet 10, Montana Miss. [Inaudible] - No, I won't. I'm sorry. 50 pounds to five, Montana Miss. Make your mind up, Governor. Scrub that out and put a 50 pound to five, Montana Miss. 122, thank you, Sir. A bet [inaudible] for Dickie Wig. Two bob each way. We're sorry, all sold out. Thanks, don't want to be at half past four. [Chatter] Irish Jig, Irish Jig, come on. Come on, Irish Jig. [Shouting] Montana Miss, I'm sorry. I'm not. I bet the 50 pounds to five. 25, 30, one, two, three, four, and five. And that settles my account with Jones and Pike. Home, sweet home for me. But you're mad. We can't stop now, when our luck's changed. I've told you before, I'm not all that interested in betting. I love horses. If only I could have a horse of my own and train it. Ah, what's the use of talking rubbish? You'll never own a horse. Ah, well, if you're leaving, I'm going to stay. I haven't go a home, sweet home to go to now anyways, thanks to you. What do you mean? What do you think I'm doing this job for? I haven't got another job coming up till Thursday. That's all right. Come stay with us for a few days. Do you mean it? Yes, of course I do. Go on. Carry on. I'll wait for you. [Chuckles] All right, Sir, good afternoon. [Horse whinnies] Try this, it's [inaudible]. What a beautiful animal. She ought to pay for her keep. Montana Miss? Yes, that's what I keep telling him. But he's bent on selling here. What do you think she'll get? Oh, he wouldn't take less than 300. That shouldn't be difficult. 300. You can't go wrong at that price. Perhaps I can get the bank to lend me 300 pounds. Only if they've gone balmy too. Well, I could my stock. That would buy you half a saddle. There must be some way out. [Animals screeching] Oh, Daddy, have you busted it? Well whose is it? It's mine. Don't talk nonsense. It's mine. What are you talking about? How did you get the money? Well it isn't exactly only mine. You see, we all gave seven and six pence each. And there's 30 of us. And each girl has it one day of the month. And when there's 31 days in the month, then I have it two days, because it was my idea to form a syndi-- syndi-- syndi-something. She's got it! Wonderful, Sue. Oh, ho, wonderful, wonderful. Isn't she clever? Well don't you see, a syndicate. That's how we'll buy Montana Miss. What, with 30 people paying seven and six? No, 200 or 300, putting a pound in each. And where will you find 300 people fool enough? [Excited shouting] Give us a chance. Everyone will get paid. I think you'll find them. [Music playing] Hey! Ho! Hey! Yeah, what is it? Take that back. Give us that ticket. But look. 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 8788, 89, 90, 93. Oh, that's not bad for a start, eh? No, not at all. But I don't see how we're going to raise at least 300 pounds by Wednesday. My birthday. Yes, darling, I know. And the next day there's a race meeting. Montana Miss may come up for auction. 300 quid by Wednesday? Why that's easy. We'll have to get cracking. Anybody got any ideas? I know. Buckingham Palace-- George. [Music playing] Hey, George Curry, oh, I've got so much to tell you. (SPEAKING RAPIDLY) We've got a lovely idea. We've all got together. We're buying this horse, you see? (SPEAKING VERY RAPIDLY) [music playing] Ticket, please. Three more, can't stop on my Blue Ridge, because they'll have a blue fit. Hi, manners. Ah, it is good of you. Are all the tickets gone? Well, a tiny few to go yet. Well, here's another seven. Bill's out now, trying to polish off the rest. And if he can't? SUE: Be careful. Mind my new dress. Come on. Oh, isn't it lovely? Look, she made it herself. Nothing's more [inaudible]. You two go on. I'll come in later. SUE: --five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Mr. Rimmel said to give you these. Oh, thank you. Anything else? No. Well? Is it really Susie's birthday? That's right. Oh. Would you like a piece of birthday cake? Yea. All right, go on. Come on, everybody. If you don't eat them before they melt, you'll have to drink them. But Bill isn't here yet. Well, if he can't be here on time, that's his look up. Sue, here's another guest. Oh, hello, Albert. Hello. Hello, you decrepit old lady. Now then, ready, steady, blow. [Excited cheering] I'll do it. Here's the first installment for your own bike, the bike will come later. Oh, thank you, Daddy. Would you like this? Look, isn't it smashing? [Noisemakers blow] [excited shouts] Bill! Sorry I'm late, mate. Here you are. Happy birthday, and many of them. My own horse ticket-- look. Look, everybody. Look what Bill just gave me. Look, my own horse ticket. Well, I've double checked it. We can't make anymore. These are the final figures. [Inaudible] 27, [inaudible] 11, Radio Mart 15, Milk Bar 38. Well done, Maggie. Temple Tool-- Haven't you got more friends than that? In my profession, they don't like friends, only acquaintances. That make it 228 in all. It's still a long way from 300, aren't we. I told you it was mad. Better give them all their money back. What, after all this? We've scraped the bottom of the barrel in Lamb's Green. We can't give in now. We've won bigger battles than this. It's no use hollering up guards and at him and on with the Light Brigade. You can get what isn't there. The Light Brigade, I wonder if the chaps could come. I don't think they'd remember me. And yet, it's worth trying. They were always the lively lot. [Snoring] [music playing] Race in [inaudible]. Arthur Hill. Nosey Parker. Horsey Hill, great Scott, where have you been in all these years, Eh? What have you been doing with your self, Hill? Oh, messing about with animals. Big game hunter, dear fellow? Lion? Elephant? No, white mice and goldfish. I sell them, sort of, sort of shop. Great Scott. I think this calls for a drink. Never heard such nonsense, leaving you on your birthday to do go on a wild goose chase. It's not a wild goose chase. My Daddy can make anybody do anything. Huh. So I thought, what we people in Lambs Green lack was a biblical excitement. So I said, what about having a bit of a fling this summer? After all, the spirit of adventure isn't dead. What's a better adventure? What's greater fun than to own a race horse? Throw the [inaudible] out here. This is [inaudible]. It's a master ticket [inaudible].. One for my boy too. Rubbish, rubbish, stuff and nonsense. Now what's all this nonsense about another rapper is it? I don't know what this confounded club is coming to. What are we going to have next, coconut shells? Hm? Hm? Are you a new member, Sir? No, Sir Robert, but I, I haven't been here for a long time. Ooh, wait a moment. I remember you. I never forget a face. Arthur Dale-- Hill, Sir. That's right. They'll send us 14, wasn't it? You did very well. Are you doing well now? Well, not too badly, sir. Now, look here, Dave. Stop selling these things in the club. Or I'll have to report you to the committee. Do you understand? Hm? Yes Sir. Pity, good chap. One day, a grand military aid, 23 I think, his father's horse. What he doing now? Keeps a pet shop, I believe, in Lamb's Green. Well, that is a [mumbles]. Funny family, they keep anything. Do you know what his father did? He kept a French woman in India. Yes, I remember. It was [inaudible]. Oh I'm so happy. Hello, Sue. Did you have a lovely time a the club, Daddy? Yes, thank you. Were they all real pleased to see you? Ha ha ha, yes, I, I suppose so. Don't you feel proud selling all those tickets? The trouble is, I haven't. But the man told me you had. What are you talking about? What man? The old gentleman. What, what old gentleman? Not as old as all that. Sir. Took a taxi, beat you to it. Terribly sorry, I was rude to you at the club. You know, gout and all that sort of thing plays the devil with one's temper. Well, don't stand gawking there. To whom shall I write out the check? The check, Sir? What check, Sir? To make out the 300 pounds. I'll pay the difference. Don't see why you want to drag those chaps at the club in. Keep it to ourselves. Um hm. I can't thank you enough, Sir. But that means 72 tickets. Don't worry about that, Dale. I'm not a rich man, but I might as well enjoy all I've got. No one to leave it to, excepting my daughter. She does modest dancing. Can't stand it. [Chatter] All right then, Major Hill is unanimously elected the president of our syndicate. [Applause] Thank you, very much indeed. Now, I'm going to nominate Mr. Temple as our honorary treasurer. I think you shall agree, it's his profession. Makes him eminently suitable. I feel very honored to be honored by this honor in this way. Hey wait a minute. You haven't been voted for yet. [Laughter] All right, you're in. I feel very honored to be on-- And one final bit of good news. Tomorrow Ptolemies runs in a selling plate. [Cheers] I feel very honored. [Chatter] [shouting] It's done! It's done! Do you realize what this means? I won 30 bob. It means Montana Miss is coming up for sale now. That's why it's called a selling plate. Oh, here we have Montana Miss, winner of last season's Mulberry Stakes, Are really beautiful filly. Now who's starting off with 100 guineas? Thank you, Sir, 100 guineas. That's him there, look. - Major Hill? - Yes. Nelson of the "Mail," Sir. Hold it. 260 I'm bid, 260. 270. [Excited chatter] 400, 400 I'm bid, 400, 400. Any advance on 400 guineas? For the last time, 400 guineas. 400 guineas once, 400 guineas twice, sold for 400 guineas. Now I have to offer this six-year-old gelding. Know anything about him? Yeah, he's a [inaudible] gone off completely, one of Charlie Mott's lot. Oh, come on. But I-- Come on, Man. [Interposing voices] Well you see, it all started when Daddy tripped over my bicycle. AUCTIONEER: 230. 230. Any advance on 230? 240. 240. Thank goodness, we're just in time. 250! 250, thank you, Sir. 250 guineas. Any advance on 250 guineas? (LAUGHING) That gives us 50 pounds to play with. Excuse me there. Yes. AUCTIONEER: 250 twice. Sold for 250 guineas. It's the wrong horse. What's happened? Your name, Sir? Horse-- uh, Hill, Major Hill. Put down Major Hill. Have you got him? Got the wrong one. Which one have you got? Father's Folly, by Bachelor Knight out of Maiden's Ruin. Sounds a purpose 'tween two accidents to me. [Music playing] Is that his? Yes. Bit common looking. Hm? What's he say? Says it's a bit common looking. Anyone can see that. Look at who's talking. [Laughter] There you are. He isn't a bad one really, just a bit highly strung. He won't concentrate. Rubbish! With proper handling, any horse can be made to concentrate. Well, to-- to be frank, some of the owners would prefer to sell and cut their losses. But it, if you think if stands a chance, they might-- Every week he's being trained, he's costing the fund more and more money. Hear, hear. Why don't some of you stop nagging and grumbling. Well, if he's made a muck of it, why don't somebody else have a go? Who? You? No, Ernie Small, he's got an horse, hadn't he? Well, he don't know his horse from his elbow. Why don't they get rid of this horse. [Shouting] Now look here. I'm quite will to resign if that's the wish of the syndicate. In the meantime, I must carry on as best I can. ALL: Hear, hear. Hear, hear. [Horse whinnies] Stop this horse! [Airplane engine roars] Oh, Daddy, Daddy. Whoa. Now you see what I mean about highly strung. [Shouting] Well, highly strung or not, we've got to make up our minds once and for all. Either we sell him or try him on the 15th. Well, he'll be as ready on the 15th as he'll ever be. And with a Charlie Smirke in the saddle, he might even get into the first half dozen. Well, as [inaudible] treasurer, I still think that it's just wasting money. All right. All right? Yes, yes. Hm, yes. All right. Good, well here's to the 15th. [Music playing] Here we are at James Alexander Park runners and riders. Now where's it at? Here it is, Father's Folly. Oh, blimey, Montana Miss is in the same race. Oh, that's where my dollar's going. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All right, and anybody who backs Montana Miss is a fifth caller [inaudible]. ALL: Hear, hear. Oh, stop, I've got some in my eyes! [Shrieks] HAIR STYLIST: There we are. I hate it, I tell you. I hate it. I don't care if you do hate it. Your dad said I was to get you decent. You know what the say. You've got to suffer to be beautiful. I don't want to be beautiful. I wish I could be ugly, and be a man, and drive a bus. I'll tell Bill that. He'll love the ugly part. You beast, don't you dare. You, uh, putting any money on our Gigi tomorrow? Everybody's gone daft about that horse, gnashing about it day and night. You're going though, aren't you? Oh, I'm going all right. Just because Bill's going. And that's quite enough from you, Sore Spot. Bill and me is mates on the bus. And that's all there is to it. You put any money on him, Sam? What? Without knowing who is riding him 24 hours before the race? What's that to you? He'll have a good jockey. Won't he, Sir? Well, we're, we're trying our best. Lucky to find any jockey to ride a horse with a name like that. What's the name got to do with it, you clot? Oh, here, stay on. Look, I won't be called a clot in me own shop. Here, I've got ladies back here. And the shop's only half yours. They're off again. What's it about this time? Oh, now they're worrying because they haven't got a jockey yet. Hey, where do you think you're going? Daddy. Here, Miss, you're not supposed to be in here. What about Charlie Smirke? What about Dick Turpin? But Daddy, Mr. Peters said that if Charlie Smirke was-- He was only just joking. Not jockeys like Charlie Smirke-- But, Daddy, have you tried him? - Well I haven't got the nerve. - Well I have. What? I wrote to him yesterday. [Music playing] Send a telegram. Will you? Just seeing all about your syndicate. Stop. Will consider it a privilege to represent Lambs Green. And you better add, with all my love, from Charlie. ANNOUNCER: Fifth race, fetch all runners and riders. Charlie Smirke to ride Lambs Green racing sensation. NEWSPAPER VENDOR: [inaudible] Charlie Smirke to ride-- Charlie Smirke to ride Lambs Green horse. Get your paper. Fifth race special. [Cheers] There we are. Wasn't it nice of them to let us have the old bus. They made them to last in those days. Without a sunshine roof, I'd have marked it export early. [Laughter] [horn honks] [music playing] All right, all right, don't rush me. [Music playing] I suppose that's the first time you heard about this. Yes, yes. There he is. Mr. Smirke. Hello, Darling, how are you? Hey, I don't get this from all the other owners. I, I hope it brings you luck. I hope it does. Please, not just before the race, Susan. Don't get him any more excited. He's bad enough as it is. Charlie, here's money for Peter Simple. 20 pound to one, Father's Folly. Father's Folly, 20 pound to one, [inaudible] number's 41. Father's Folly, Sir. I've got Montana Miss. All right, [inaudible],, are you? [Inaudible] 10 pounds Father's Folly. Members and owners only. Hm? Hm? (SHOUTING) Members and owners only. Well, what do you think we are, horses? Look, number 11. Look. Well, I knew Charlie Smirke before you born, my dear. Come on, you two. What's the matter? We, we shall miss the race. [Excited chatter] Frightfully sorry. SPECTATOR: MAN: 20 Father's Folly, all right. MAN: Strike 21, Father's Folly. [Inaudible] Four Montana Miss, that's [inaudible].. SPECTATOR: 20, Father's Folly. SPECTATOR: I'll bet 21 Father's Folly. SPECTATOR: 25 pound on Folly for the [inaudible].. MAN: Four Montana Miss. Look, there. ANNOUNCER: Their on the starter's orders. Let me. There, 11. They're going into the loop now. I can see him quite clearly. What a lovely coat. And his eyelashes-- What are you talking about? Stuart Granger. And the girl just next to him looks-- oh, she looks just like-- Charlie Smirke is having trouble. [Airplane engine roars] Look out! He's bolted. [Excited chatter] ANNOUNCER: First, number four; second, number nine; third, number 12, won by six lengths. Sorry about that, Major. We should be sorry, giving you a mount like that. Ah, he's not too bad. But why didn't you tell him it wasn't the Grand National? What? Didn't you see him jump that barrier down there? He might not be too hot in the flat. But I tell you, he can jump all right. Jumper-- the Grand National. Yeah, some people will never learn. [Music playing] [angry chatter] That horse, wonder they take it to Parliament. You'd think they was in Parliament, the row they're making. [Shouting] MAJOR HILL: Order, please. Order. I repeat-- I repeat-- I repeat, if it's the wish of the meeting, I'm quite willing to resign. [Shouting] But I think you ought to hear what Charlie Smirke said. What? He told me, and he ought to know, that Father's Folly is a born jumper. [Angry shouts] Mr. Chairman, I protest. What, again? I reckon as how there are people here that don't like the truth. That's because the truth hurts. Why don't you stick to the point? I'm coming to that. I propose we move a vote of no confidence against Major Hill. [Shouting] I reckon the Major's misused our money. What do you mean, he's misused out money? I'm the treasurer, aren't I? [Laughter] On a point of order, you can only move a vote of confidence. Who says? I haven't got any confidence. That's why I'm going to move a vote of no confidence. If a vote of confidence gets defeated, it comes to the same thing. Doesn't it? Twirp! On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. I object to brother Leon calling brother Fisher a twirp. Hear, hear. Aye, aye, what's all this brother stuff? Do we look like brothers? [Laughter] This isn't a union meeting. Well, it was beginning to sound like one. All right, I change that to brother twirp. [Laughter] BILL: Order, order, order, please. Now, will anyone propose a proper vote of confidence in Major Hill? I will, Mr. Chairman. Knowing the boy 35 years, promising youngster at Sanders, good soldier, fine horseman, level-headed, and straight as a dial. Anything wrong with that? Hm? Hm? [Shouting] I second that. I third that. And can we have a show of hands? Well, there you are. Major Hill, the meeting says carry on. [Cheers] Thank you very much. And I give you my word, we'll do everything to make our horse a jumper that all sportsmen will remember, even if he is called Father's Folly. [Laughter] Did you hear that? We don't like the name either, Major. Well, what about it? Shall we change his name? ALL: Yeah! [Excited shouts] WOMAN: Why not call it Evelyn? Why not call it Evelyn? Why not call it Evelyn? But, Madam, it's a he. So was my late husband. And he was called Evelyn. [Laughter] I, I, I've got a suggest to make-- the Galloping Major. [Shouts] (SINGING) Bumpety, bumpety, bump, riding about on me charger. Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bump, like an Indian rajah. All the girls declare that he's a gallant major. Hi, hi, clear the the way. Here comes the Galloping Major. [Cheers] Now, ladies and gentlemen, before we get too carried away, there is one thing we must not overlook. This new training is going to cost money. Then there are the entrance fees. And if we really want to make the Grand National, it will cost 100 pounds alone to enter him. The evidence-- don't say I didn't warn you. Oh, why don't you shut up. [Chatter] [gavel bangs] Is there anyone here who backed Montana Miss this afternoon? [Chatter] Well, I did. And as we need to open a training fund, here goes. For the Galloping Major. Good idea. Oh, you. Well, I said I might back it. Didn't I? And I'll take my stake back anyway. [Laughter] Now, come on, everybody, own up. Come on. Come on. Come on. In my profession, you learn a thing or two about human nature. 106 pound eight and four pence. That's not enough to pay the training and the Grand National. There's only one thing for it. We just have to train that horse ourselves. [Music playing] NARRATOR: Training a race horse in London is difficult without official blessing. Park keepers like to keep things off the grass. What about rule 19? That's all right. We've thought of everything. NARRATOR: The Major was forced to be almost continuously in the saddle as the training schedule expanded. Timetables went overboard to cope with additional request stops. And the Green's belt had to be pulled in several notches while the syndicate combined duties of landscape gardeners and scene shifters. Everything was sacrificed to the Galloping Major. And when father went out with the plan, mother was left holding the baby. There he goes. [Train whistle toots] Jumped it clean today, didn't he? Oh, his jumping's all right. But I've nowhere near enough space to work on his speed. NARRATOR: Not enough space. What about Hyde Park? [Music playing] But as the strenuous training began to make its mark, Lambs Green racing stable me powerful opposition. There was that day in November, when official indignation nearly put an end to their efforts. Then came the prolonged cold spell, when training came to a dead stop. Snowbound days kept them indoors. And they began to wish that instead of a horse, they had a reindeer. How they longed to start filling in his racing calendar. And how everyone in Lambs Green trembled and prayed when the Galloping Major caught pneumonia. [Music playing] But it was not all worry and anxiety that the chaser brought to Lambs Green throughout that long winter. There were also rewards. [Music playing] And so at last came spring. And the hopes of Lambs Green began to rise to unprecedented heights. Encouraged by their steeplechaser's fine performance in one or two minor races, they made the big decision. The Galloping Major was entered for the Grand National. [Music playing] Two Aintree Glories. All right, Peggy, another Aintree Glory. [Chatter] I suppose you're afraid to try something else one day. You might enjoy it. Why don't you leave me alone? Because you sow the Earth with your misery. What about that horse, eh? If we'd have listened to you, we'd have sold him months ago. Now half the country has got its money on it. What have you got to say that, eh? More baked bean, Miss, out. You going to entry? Of course, I think it does you good, a weekend away from home. You won't [inaudible] for that, [inaudible].. See that. They're sending a special horse box for the Galloping Major to drive him to Liverpool in the morning. Give over. It's only a penny outside. MAJOR HILL: Sue, bed. Do you know what time it is? Oh, please, no, Daddy. I've just finished this. Can't I take it to the Galloping Major now? No, no, no, certainly not. You can do it in the morning before they come and fetch him. Oh, please, Daddy, please, please. I wouldn't go to sleep, obviously. And I haven't got to have a bath. Oh, please, Daddy. Now, now, no more nonsense. Bed, ah. Right. She'd stay up half the night if she could. So I've noticed. Good night, all. [Gargling] [music playing] [horse neighs] [music playing] Come on, Daddy, please hurry up. Come on. You'll be late for it. Come on. Please, hurry. Please, Daddy, come along here, quick. Come on. I've worked it out. It's just 32 hours and 17 minutes before the National. Come on. Ah, well, this is the day. He's gone! He's gone! He's gone! We don't know where he is. I swear I fastened the door last night. I swear I did. And when I came down this morning, I found it open. It's my fault, Daddy. It's all my fault. I went to take the rug. Sue, pull yourself together. What happened? I only wanted him to have the rug. I didn't mean to. I really didn't mean to. I knew this would happen. What a way to run a racing stable. Never mind about that now. Bill, you tell the depot. I'll ring the police. The thing is to find that horse. The thing is to stop wasting any more money. Scratch the horse now. [Music playing] [sobbing] Hey, what's that horse doing there? He was wanted 10 minutes ago. [Banging] [chatter] All right, if everybody's ready, come on. Light the eye. Red light. Sound. Stand by, everybody. Now come on, boys. Let's go. Faster. You ready, Desmond? Sound is up. Camera's running. He's up. 309, take four. Action. What tidings, lieutenant, of the armada? Cut it. Oh, Jack, I'm sorry. Who made a word like armada? Oh, Jack, I'm sorry. I know it's armada, armada, armada. It's-- What's What's that? This is no good. I asked for a gray. It's nothing to do with me. I just brought it along. [Inaudible] times I get a bay. I told Gobbs. That's all right. I can manage. Get it's sprayed. Get it sprayed. Whoa, boy. Hold still, boy. Hold still, boy. Come on, boy. [Music playing] Then you take the short cut after Beegum Abbey. And we'll see you in the morning. OK, gov. NEWSPAPER VENDOR: Lambs Green horse is gone. Paper. [Horn honks] "Star News Standard," Lambs Green horse still at large. No sign of him anywhere. Now who's right? You listened to me, we'd have sold that horse. If your parents had had any sense, you wouldn't be here to be listened to. Any news from your friend down at the police station? Doing what he can. But they say they've got more important things to worry about than lost horses. It's all those crimes of passion. Never mind about passion. I'd like some bread and dripping. REPORTER (ON RADIO): --news. We've got a special message about the missing racehorse from Lambs Green. It's about us. REPORTER (ON RADIO): The animal is still believed to be astray in the London area. And the police ask anyone who might see the missing horse to approach it gently. Do not shout. Offer it sugar. And make a sound of this description-- hoopalong, hoopalong, hoopalong. On the eve of the race, hope of its being found time is rapidly fading, to the dismay of thousands of punters everywhere. The only optimists are the people of Lambs Green, who go on hoping for a last-minute miracle to happen. While the search-- Optimists, coo-- lunatics if you ask me, making fools of ourselves and leading a lot of punters up the garden. If I had my way, I'd tell the BBC now-- Well you're not going to have your way. I'm sorry. But I'm afraid you've got a point there. Comes a time when you can't go on hoping. [Shouting] [glass shattering] They're after our blood. That's what it is. They're after our blood. It's not save to go out. We nearly them with that motorbike. Didn't see their numbers, worse luck. Who were they? Sore about their bets, I suppose. I don't blame them. We better get it over. I'll issue a statement that the horse won't run. We'd better lie low from now on. What about these? Can't we sell them? I'll have mine now, if you don't mind. I'm going to catch the first train in the morning. But you're mad. They'll murder you. If there's going to be any trouble, I'd rather be there. What do you intend to do? Be evacuated? I'm not a coward. I'll come. [Horn honks] [baby cries] I hear the whole thing's off. You're telling me. Wish they'd of told me last night. Bye-bye, Darling. Bill, I rang up the BBC. They wouldn't take it over the phone. Will you take this there in person? Yeah, that's OK. I don't go on till 8:00. Right. Can I come to the BBC with you, Bill? Her dad said she was to go to school as per usual. Oh, Bill. Oh, now, look I'm sorry, mate. It looks as though nobody is going to have a holiday in Lambs Green. You better get to school. This was going to be such a lovely day. Yes, Ducks, I know. But brooding about it won't help. Record crowds have poured into Liverpool. And the weather experts promise a glorious Grand National. Look! It's him. I'd know it anywhere. Oh, if only Bill was here. We must stop him before he gets to the BBC. But it doesn't say where they're making the film I know, Rosedale, where they have the Silver Screen Smile contests. You run after Bill, Ducks. And we'll go and phone the studio. STUDIO MAN (ON PHONE): No, no, it's on location today. There's no phone for miles. You'll have to wait, madam, until they get in touch with us this evening. Thank you. Thank you, very much. It's him all right. And they've taken him away to Chester. They're filming there. Oh, blast it. Chester? That's near Liverpool, isn't it? So it is. I never thought of that. Well, what are we waiting for? What about delivering the Major's note? Well, he won't mind if we deliver the horse instead, will he? (LAUGHING) Oh, I love you. I'll see you at the depot. Oh. What's the matter with you? I think he said that I love you. Come on. [Music playing] [excited chatter] [inaudible] can do my shift for me. Well if you go, they'll all want to go. Now, Gov, there's a list of volunteers to keep the service going if you let the others go. OK. [Excited chatter] [music playing] [cheers] [music playing] All present and correct, Gov. Great day, this, Sergeant, just like [inaudible].. [Horn honks] [music playing] [chatter] No replies, I don't understand it. Nothing on the wireless, nothing in the midday papers. Maybe they got Bill on his way to the BBC. Bill's like the Rock of Gibraltar. If he says he'll do a thing he does. And no reply from [inaudible]. There must be something in it. There's still time to declare that horse. [Music playing] Aren't you quoting a price for the Galloping Major? Aye? I said, aren't you quoting a price for the Galloping Major? I had the sense to lose him. Yes, but are you sure he's not running? Nothing's been said about his being scratched. Look, I'll lay you 1,000 to 1 on the Galloping Major. Do you want it? How impertinent. Come on. We don't want any trouble. Six [inaudible]. Are you laying the 1,000 to one against the Galloping Major? Got money to throw away on her? Yes, I have. I'll have 5,000 to 5. 5,000 to five, Galloping Major, 334. Six of [inaudible]. [Chatter] I'll take two. Thanks, love. Are queens wild? [Chatter] Yeah, but are you or are you not the owners? I told you, there are 300 owners. But the horse is entered in the name of Major Hill. And he's at Aintree. I can only hand the horse over to him. Oh, blimey. Well you better come with us then. Yeah, but the owner's got to charge them, hasn't he? Oh, holy smoke. We'll bring them along as well. Come on. ANNOUNCER: And what a location this is. Of course, there's no place like Aintree, and no race like the National. And with all the runners I've mentioned, this is sure to be one of the most exciting races of recent years. Of course, bear in mind, there may yet be another runner, because there is a rumor going about the racecourse that the Galloping Major has been found. And if he can get here in time, he'll be amongst the starters. Members of the Lambs Green syndicate have already been seen in the car park. Hey, two teas, five pence. [Excited chatter] [inaudible] What about the Galloping Major? I'll be generous, 200 to one. All right then, two quid to win, please. Well make it 30. Make that three [inaudible]. Come down to the three and a half, Galloping Major, 542. Haven't got any inside information, have you? What do you think we gave you all that dough for, charity? ANNOUNCER: And now I just had some more information about the Galloping Major. He's on his way to the course. And every assistance to his progress is being give by the county authorities. [Music playing] Bill. Hm? - You know what you said to me. - What? You know. What about it? Did You mean it? Course I meant it. Wouldn't have said if I didn't mean it. Would I? Oh, Bill. You know, we can't worry about that now. Can we? [Music playing] ANNOUNCER: I've got some fairly terrific new about the Galloping Major. Everything's all right. The horse box he's traveling in has been spotted going through Buckman Head. And he's, at the moment, actually in the Mersey Tunnel. [Music playing] Well, it can't take us long now. All right, if he knows his way about Liverpool. [Laughter] I haven't come here to be made a fool of. Here, take this. Well that has put the lid on it. I've never know a day like this. ANNOUNCER: Here's an announcement. In view of the unusual circumstances, though the Galloping Major has not yet arrived on the course, he has been accepted as a runner. Jack, you can't do this. You know what it means to us. You go in the paddock then. Let them take the Mickey out of you. I wish I could. Say, a great day this, Dale, great day. Jack's walked out on us. We can't run the Major. Can't run him after all this? Rubbish. Yeah, ride him yourself. 20 years ago, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but not now. No, I, I can't. You're in command. You've got to be last to the post. I mean, first to the post. Come on. Hm? Hm? And here's the big news that you've all been waiting for. I just received definite confirmation that the Galloping Major is less than half a mile away from the course, and will certainly reach now on time. [Music playing] [train whistle toots] Three minutes to go, gentlemen. Oh, no, Sir, no, no, no, no, no, it's hopeless. Nonsense, it fits you like a glove. [Cheers] SUE: Daddy! Daddy! I hope we got in time. Darling, you've won all your medals back now. We've only got a couple of minutes. Come on. Oh 28 pounds overweight. 28 pounds. This is madness. We can't go through with this. We've got to run the horse now, Major. But it doesn't matter if you don't win the race. Rubbish, of course he'll win. Mr. Temple will faint if he sees you, Dad. He won't see him. Oh, look at him. [Chatter] ANNOUNCER: Well here at Aintree, the tension is increasing as the big moment approaches. And you that it's spreading through the crowds packing in the stands and enclosures, as the horses turn out to the parade one by one parade canter down to the start for the calling of the roll. That doesn't take long, nor does the lining up, for there's no draw. And the riders can pick their own places in the line. Let me have a look, please. ANNOUNCER: In fact, the white flag is now up. And they'll be off at any moment on this tremendous test of man and horse. I can see the Galloping Major well placed on the inside, looking quite cool. And so is his rider, Major Hill. Look, there he is! ANNOUNCER: Now they're coming down into line. It looks as though the starters will get them off first time. They're right up to the tapes. Yes, they're off. Yay! Daddy! Come on. ANNOUNCER: --with Corn Cob and [inaudible] just behind. The Galloping Major got well away, but he's not being pressed. Over the first they go, with Troubadour and Gay Dawn in the lead. Already down are Roberta Rose, Overtime, Fitzgerald, and Madigan. And the Galloping Major is over. And coming to the second now, it's Troubadour leading at a good gallop, with Lean Lad, Beau Gest, and Scratcher well there. Of course, the field is spreading out quite a bit now. Galloping Major has dropped back a bit. It's neck or nothing in this race, with the ground a bit treacherous and the pace making it worse. Coming now to the next, it's still Scratcher and Gay Dawn in front, with Lean Lad and Troubadour. [Inaudible] are over. No, down goes Checky Boy, as the field sweeps by. On now to the next fence, Gay Dawn takes it well. So does Mariner. And it's Muscleman's turn to go. Where's the Galloping Major? What about the Galloping Major. I can't see him, matey. Must be there somewhere. ANNOUNCER: Still they charge on. Irish Shelia is there, but down goes What For. The field is thinning out fast. And now there must be about 30 lengths between the first and last horses. Still going all right is the Galloping Major. Although he's got a lot of ground to make up. Constable, constable, I've got a train to catch. - Oh, let them wait. - Don't mess about. ANNOUNCER: Now it's Troubadour in the lead again, with Gay Dawn second, as they're really eating up the ground. Jackson's riding the race of his life on this horse, going better than ever we've seen him before. And going right up with the leaders are Beau Gest, Corn Cob, Scratcher. And then three lengths behind is Irish Shelia. I can't see any signs of the Galloping Major now. So that about puts pain to the hopes of Lambs Green. [Groans] But the pace is breaking up the field fast. Gay Dawn and Troubadour are well over. But now it's goodbye to Good Evening. And the falls are coming thick and fast. In fact there seem to be more loose horses at this stage of the race than for many years. And now Corn Cob's refused. And as they're coming up for the next, it's Beau Gest. And down goes Showcase. Well, the field's cut right up now. And there are only a few left standing. But they're keeping up this cracking pace. And there goes Lean Lad to narrow it still further. Now they're heading at last [inaudible].. But they've got some way to go yet. Still Troubadour leading as Some Fun drops out. And that leaves only a handful of horses in the struggle. Now Gay Dawn is challenging as they come up to the next. Troubadour is over well. So are Beau Gest. And [inaudible] out of it. This is sensational. And only four left in the race, Troubadour, Gay Dawn, Beau Gest, and Stretcher. Oh, and there goes Beau Gest. Only three left in it now. And there goes Scratcher. I've never seen anything like it. Only two horses left. And it's Troubadour and Gay Dawn only coming to the last. But one-- oh, Gay Dawn unseats her jockey. This is amazing, only one horse left on his feet. Troubadour is coming down to the last fence. And Jackson, his jockey, is off. This is utterly fantastic. All the horses in the National have fallen. There's never been anything like it in the history of the race. It's a clean sweep for the books. [Chatter] Come on, Mate. It's all over. [Chatter] Look! What's this? I believe there is still a horse on the course. Everybody's rushing back to the stands to have a look. Daddy! Come on, old boy. Don't let them down. By Jove, it is! It's Major Hill on the Lambs Green horse. Yes, it's clearly the Galloping Major. And he looks-- Hooray! ANNOUNCER: It looks as though there'll be a winner after all. [Horns honking] ANNOUNCER: Even going at top speed, Major-- Oh, I'm afraid-- though, he's obviously almost exhausted. What a tragedy, when there's such a rich prize within his grasp. The Galloping Major's actually stopped. [Groans] Hoopalong, hoopalong. [Shouting] ANNOUNCER: Yes, he's moving again. Will he do it? Only one more fence-- no, he's stopped once more. [Shouting] What can I do? ANNOUNCER: It's all right. He's moving again. And it looks as if he's keeping it up this time, only one more fence. No one else in sight, not even a remounted animal. Now he's heading for the jump. The Major's putting him into it. No, he's refused. This is really the most incredible race I've ever seen. Now the Major's turning him around. The strain on everyone is terrific. Not only the syndicate, but everybody here wants to see at least one gallant animal complete this famous course. Come on, Major, get him up. Come along, Major. Come along, not far. Go on, kick it. What can I do? ANNOUNCER: Yes, he's pulling again. And he's over. By Jove, he's over. Whoopee! [Non-english speech] ANNOUNCER: Everybody else is shouting and cheering. Only have the run in, or shall I say the crawl in, left to do. Will he make it? He's standing still! Oh, please, dear. No, he's moving. We've got a winner after all. The Galloping Major has won. But I don't know who is the more exhausted, him or me. [Cheering] Hey, kiss me. [Excited chatter] (SINGING) Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bump riding along on a charger. Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bump, as proud as and Indian rajah. All the girls declare that he's a gay old stager. Hey, hey, clear the way, here comes the Galloping Major. [Music - "the galloping major"]
