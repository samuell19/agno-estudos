We were warned something like this would happen, but by the time governments listened to science, it was already too late. The pandemic has brought society to a sudden halt, now chaos reigns as our own technology turns against us, spreading a new virus, disinformation. No way of knowing what to believe, we are becoming more divided every day. Across the country, schools are shutting down in preparation for a nationwide lockdown beginning at midnight tonight. With death tolls rising and infections at an all time high, there is real fear in the air. Doomsday prophets and religious fanatics are calling it Judgment Day. We live in the greatest country in the world. If this virus was really a threat, our government would've done something way earlier. You need to open your eyes, Fox, see this for what it is, a plandemic. Great, I volunteer to do final checkouts and I get stuck with some QAnon reject. - I'm just saying- - I don't care. Come on, Sal, drop the conspiracy bullshit. I just, I wanna get this place closed up and get on the road, it's a long drive back to Sacramento. Hey, Jamie. Last shift? Yeah, turned into a late one. Why'd they make you do final rounds? I volunteered, wouldn't have if Kevin told me who I was going to be partnered with. So what happened to us being in a hurry? And you just reminded me why I need to get the fuck outta here ASAP. Hm. Hello? Is someone there? Sal, is that you? Look, I don't have time for this, I still have- - Fox! Settle down, it's just me. Ah, Jesus. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Heh. Hey, Kevin. Jesus, you scared the shit outta me. We really need to get out of here. - Where's Jamie? - Kevin, can we just get out here? Serves you right! Amy! You scared me! Ah, something's wrong, that doesn't look normal. You're right, he's not. Where are you going, Kief? Huh, hi, there, how's it going? I'm just gonna go and grab a coffee and a cream Danish before we gotta go hide out from the RA. The RA's locked our ID, the whole city's on lockdown, remember? I know, at least we still got our imaginations. Imagination, what imagination? You don't even know if you're a Beavis or a Butthead. I think you're mistaken, my friend. Well, actually, I think we met before. Pledge week? You vomited on me. Oh yeah, the projectile, super sick, yeah, how you been? Great. Hey listen, this has been fun and all, but I gotta take care of some business, some risky business. I'll catch you losers later. I gotta get out of here, I have to go to today. Right here. She just disappeared. It's called a glitch, big whoop. Guys, we go to a shitty state school, everything is old and broken. I'll keep an eye on the security feed, see if there's another glitch or what. I'll let you guys know if- You're boring us? Yeah, you are. Oh, my God, rude, yes and yes. Uptight's getting outta control. Oh, shut up, Mitchell. You're sure you have everything you need? Yeah, my mom's stocked up enough food to last me to junior year. Remember, call me whenever, I don't want you to get too lonely in there. Where's your food, Kief? Oh yeah, I still gotta go pick up some shit from the store. Do you not realize what is going on? How do you expect to ride out the pandemic? You have to eat. Ah, my loser stepdad got me Domino's gift cards for every day of Hanukkah last year, so probably good, just order in delivery. And give away the fact that there are people here, who aren't supposed to be here. Bro, there is nobody here except for us. So does anyone have any plans? I'm just saying this could last. Two weeks tops, any longer and the economy will collapse and life without business isn't worth living. Hey, Amy, remember how much fun we had last fall, when we started knitting and finals came so we stopped? That's 'cause knitting's boring, Zuri. Amy, your creep is creeping me out. ♪ I watched you lately ♪ ♪ I need you to say, man ♪ ♪ 'Cause everything lately ♪ ♪ I've been driving me crazy ♪ Your creep is creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out, creeping me out. Amy, is everyone okay? Yeah, ah, it's just, ah... Better for the drone to go down, so long as the queen's safe. I think we just had an earthquake. Well, you don't need a degree to figure that out. Well, I guess maybe where you're from. You British bastard! No. Amy, Amy! Don't let them open the doors before I disarm it or it'll trigger the alarms. Amy, you're out of range of my feed. What's going on out there, what do you see? No. Amy, get back, get back now! It might be radioactive. Amy! Amy, come on! There could be looters, society just falling apart, people turning into savages. Arm the doors, Bob. Arm the fucking doors! No, Bob, don't! St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in Battle, be our safeguard against the wickedness and the snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, that you, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits, who wander through the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. Frank. Frank, what are you doing here? I was coming up to see if you needed a ride home, I tried calling you, but you never answered. I was on the road when, it was awful, Amy. What in God's name is going on? Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines. UV2, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and try again. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. This thing's always hell for reception. That's that. Over winter break, they outfitted the entire campus with brand new 5G receptors, service should be better than ever. Daiki thinks everyone's stuck at home in quarantine, more people on their phones are streaming online. So how am I gonna order my Domino's, man? I'm craving that crazy bread like crazy. What are we gonna do? Nothing, we're safe here. Not with you we're not, Amy broke up with you two months ago. She doesn't want anything to do with you and you show up here. Zuri, please, it's alright. No, it's not okay, Amy. Frank needs to get the message. And so do you. I don't need you to take care of me, I can handle myself perfectly fine, thank you. Did you bring anything? I was thinking that maybe we could- - No. I'm sorry, I'm so stupid, Amy. No, you're not stupid, don't say that. No. Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. It's gonna be fine. Just push that propeller in and twist. Great job, Amy. Maybe consider changing majors. You could give the entire Engineering Department a run for their money. You know, last fall, if you had have asked me that, I might have considered it. I wasn't really sure about going into medicine, then I met this boy and he has this rare autoimmune disorder and he's kind of my inspiration. Hey, so it's, ah, pretty weird having Frank here. Not like it bothers me, but. - That's good. - What's good? Good that I'm not bothered or good that Frank's here? Hm, both actually. It's strangely comforting having Frank around. Are you planning on getting back together with him? I'll understand, but personally, I think it's a big mistake. I-I think we have a real connection, Amy. Get outta your head, Bob. I've been trying to get better at that. The Joe Rogan regimen was really helping, but you have to do it every day and I-I've been slacking and that's all on me. Breathe, Bob, just breathe. So how long until you think phones and internet are back up? Hang on. Affecting more people in days than SARS did over months. This is people's worst fears, is it? I'm sorry, did I do something? No, Amy, what could you have done? It's not like you've ever ignored me, I mean you have, but you always have your reason, it is either your work or study. I was gonna call you right after I got off with Bob. That's how you called me last night, "After I got off with Bob," if there's no Bob, it's Frank. All I'm trying to do is be your friend, Amy, do you even want that? You're something else. What in God's name is going on? Let us out! I haven't seen fog like this before, Let us out! - Open the damn doors, Bob! - They've been triggered, I need to bypass the... What the hell is this? It's probably just the internet, it has been super buggy and- - He probably just got scared, we'll go outside and look for him. It's too late. They already got him. No, no, I found him. Bob, where is he, where is Daiki? Where's Daiki? Bob, what is it? What did he do? He just, ah... He jumped. He's Japanese. You've heard of the suicide forests and... Yeah. Maybe something did happen to him. If you fucking say aliens, I swear- - Hey, look, man, I don't know what it is, but something did get him, okay, I don't know what it is, but... Yeah, aliens would be pretty fucking cool. Kief might actually be right. Stay out of this, Bubble Boy. We could have been able to save him, if you were able to open the doors, the one job you're supposed to be capable of doing. Thanks to you, Daiki's dead. That's not true. Bob's a fuck up, Amy, just like your last boyfriend. I think I see a pattern. What about you, Mitch? What's a rich kid like you doing in a state school? Oh yeah, you couldn't get into a fancy Ivy League one even with Daddy's connections, because somehow you must be even stupider than you look. You fucking bitch! He's a lucky man, if he was still alive, I would've killed him myself after what he just did. What was Daiki trying to do? Make his father proud. His father found out he dropped out of his astrophysics program, living in America had inspired him to follow his dream of becoming a basketball superstar. He was scared that he went back to Japan, his father wouldn't let him come back to live his American dream. Great story, but it doesn't explain anything. Maybe he was infected like they're saying, he could have brought it over from Asia, I mean, that's where all these things come from, don't they? He hadn't been home in months! He went outside, that's all it takes, it's in the air. The Lord will come in fire and His chariots like the whirlwind to render His anger with fury and His rebuke with flames of fire. For the Lord will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh and those slain by the Lord will be many. No, no, no. There is no Catholic superstition bullshit! This is... Out, get the fuck out! Mitch. We were fine until this grease monkey showed up. You know, I would bet anything that he was the one, who infected the poor Oriental fellow in the first place. Orientals out, the group has a debt now. We don't, you are just a racist! I don't understand a word you're saying. Frank stays. Right? Zuri? Bob? Now, if you need anything, you're shit out of luck. You've got two weeks' worth of food rations. I'm in His hands now. So what are we gonna do? We could call the police. There are no police, Mickey. It's Miyuki, motherfucker. If we're gonna do that, I need like a couple days to clear some shit outta my room, 'cause I'm not violating my parole, all right? Look, the authorities should have turned up, when we set the alarm. It's a pandemic, Mitch, they're probably dealing with bigger- - If the police or anybody else are out there, they're not coming for us. Okay, but we can't just do nothing. Zuri? Bitch! Uh! Bitch! Whoa! St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in Battle, be our safeguard against the wickedness and the snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, that you, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits, who wander through the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. Hey. How you doing in there? I'm not alone, Amy, none of us are. You really think this is the end? Everything that begins must end and the world is no different. I still love you, Amy. Frank, please. I know you're with that Bill guy. It's Bob and... I don't know, he really disappointed me today. I came here for a reason, Amy. He told me I would be the one to save his only daughter. There's more to this world, Amy. Soon you will lead the faithful and we will ascend. Bob. Bob, I know you're in there. Look, I'm sorry I ignored you, I was just worried for Frank. Maybe having him here is a little uncomfortable. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you- - I should've backed you up with Frank, but instead I just acted super lame and showed off how generally insecure I am. After all you've been through and then Thanksgiving, I'm sorry, Amy, you deserve someone who... Amazing night together and then the pandemic hit. Amy, what are you looking at? Amy, what's wrong? What's going on out there, wat do you see? Is that... The front desk worker? What was she doing here? She was infected. Had to be, probably got sick on her shift and passed out in one of the rooms or offices there. She probably infected Daiki. Kief. Give me a hand. It's just up ahead. Open the door, Bob. Damn it, Bob, open the bloody doors! We can't go out there. Yeah, well, I'm not having this thing in here contaminating the rest of us. I've a family to worry about now. I found out the night before Mitch and I were supposed to move out and I couldn't go home, not that Mitch would let me. Hey, any choice you make will be the right choice, so long as it is yours. Dude's fucking nuts. Well. Now that everyone knows about the bun I baked in Nicole's oven, would anyyone care to join the proud father-to-be in a little celebratory nip? But she was dead. You all saw her, she was dead. In case there is anyone else in the building, I'm sending you all the link to the security feed, that way we can all be on the lookout. What are we looking out for? Nothing, it's bullshit. Actually, it's worse than that, it's Catholic bullshit! What if there is someone else here? Nicole. But no one's allowed to be here, not even us. Maybe we should check the rooms? Good idea. Guys, I'm thinking we should start doing nightly patrols, okay, we go in pairs. Are you fucking Hey, she is right, it is better to be safe, okay. Of course. Who goes first? The last place to check is the basement. There are no cameras down there, so I'll watch to make sure. The only reason we're letting you play lookout is because, actually, I don't even know why we're humoring you, hm. Well, that's it, we searched the entire building. If anyone wants to sneak up on us, it will be in the basement or you are even more remarkably useless than you already are. Come along, dear. Mitch, check the ah- - See, there's no one else here. I can barely see a thing. Here, take my hand. Mitchell? Where are you? What? I was right in front of... Nicole, where are you? I-I'm right here, where are you? Look, f-follow the sound of my voice. Can you hear me? Yeah, you sound really close, but Mitchell. Nicole. Nicole! Mitchell. Nicole! Mitchell! Mitchell, where did you go? I-I'm still in the basement, sweetie. Maybe you just got lost or- - No, I-I'm still here too. Nicole, where are you? Just near the elevator two, where are you? Hello, is anybody there, hello, Amy, Zuri, Kief, anybody? Mitch, go to our room! Mitch, Mitch, where are you? Mitch? Mitch, oh! St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in Battle, be our safeguard against the wickedness and the snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray that you- St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in Battle, be our safeguard against the wickedness and the snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, that you, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits, who wander through the world seeking the ruin of souls. I'm sorry to have to wake you, Amy, but I just had the worst dream. You were dead. You were all dead. I think He's trying to tell me you need to get of here. I need to get you out of here. Now come let me out. Amy, please. I could see him on Skype, but he wasn't really there. So what, Mitch just disappeared? I've been analyzing the network and it's still online, just ah, different somehow. We can still use our devices to communicate, but only with each other. My theory is that the 5G stations they put up all over campus have created a microservice zone, anyone outside the campus is, ah- - Dead. Look, 5G uses shorter radio waves than the older networks and that requires more cell receptors in closer proximity to each other for the networks to work. If something happened to the 5G stations in the city, like a power outage or maybe the mainframe got fried. What about Mitch and the pandemic? Something is going on here, Bob. I'll know more once I get a few of my tests back. But where's Miyuki? She's not on my security feed. So I'm starting to think, you know, whatever's going on here, Mitch, this pandemic, it's in the building now, right? Hey, I thought we should talk. Talk? You mean about us? No. Well, yeah, all of us. What do you really think is going on here? I didn't wanna worry the others, but none of this makes any sense. So the stuff about the 5G stations? I've been monitoring the 5G network, it's working just fine. Well then, why can't we reach anyone? Why are the phones down, why is the internet? Because we're being censored. What? By who, the government? Could be something did happen. Maybe we're in a contamination zone and they're reporting no survivors. Why would they do that? This is our country. And if we're sick, we're carriers for whatever this thing is, our country isn't gonna help us when they consider us the greatest risk to public health. But we're alive. We're human beings. No, we're not, we're Americans, Amy. Our government exists to protect our country, its values in our democracy, but its citizens, they consider us expendable, collateral damage. They? Who's they, Bob? Fear not, for I am the first and the last and the living one. I have died and behold, I am alive for evermore and I have the keys of death and Hades! I have the keys of death and Hades! I have the keys of death and Hades! I have the key of death and Hades. Oh, my God! Nicole, please, you have to find me, you have to help me. I don't know where I am. It's okay, I'll find you, I'll find you. Help me, help me please, please help, anyone! Please, help me, Amy! Amy, anyone, help me! Uh! I'm in the rec room, Nicole. Wait, Mitch, I'm coming, okay, I'm coming! Mitchell? Mitchell? Mitch. Mitch, where are you? Mitch? Mitch, where are you? I'm still here. No, I can't see you. Because you're stuck in the past. No, no, get away, get away! We who are alive, who are left, we will be caught up together with them in the clouds and we will be with the Lord in the air and so we will always be with the Lord. Frank, how did you get out? I was coming around the corner, heard a scream, walked in to find... I don't know what He did, but... No, no, no. Come on, Frank. Don't you dare. Frank. Don't please, it's not Bob, you can't go in there. - I have to Amy. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - Why? God told me to. Zuri, please, please, please, you understand, right, with Bob's autoimmune disorder, we can't go in. Collateral damage, Amy. I didn't do it. Uh! Girl, you sure know how to pick them. Amy! How'd you do it? I told you I didn't. Then what were you doing in there? Let him speak, Frank. Tell us, Bob. Tell us everything. At-at first I thought something happened and someone, the government, I don't know who was censoring our internet and blocking our calls. I've been monitoring the network frequency and I've started to see changes, little blips that don't make any sense. Before they went down, a few of my forums mentioned recent reports of the 5G network releasing an intermittent high frequency signal. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bob, I did not understand a word you just said, man. When did these reports start? Late November. Do you want us to believe the virus has somehow managed to get online? No, that's ridiculous. I'm saying the virus has only ever been online. Okay, I thought this thing was just like a really bad flu. This is no flu. High frequency signals release ionized radiation. 5G wasn't given a beta run in any test regions to work out the bugs, this was a national scale rollout and it happened fast. So is it not a good thing that you have 5G all over your campus? Run. Kief, come on, we have to go. But we just got here. Oh, God! Zuri. I'm trying, but it's not responding. Come on. Is there another way outta here? The basement, there's an old storm hatch, that takes us right to the parking lot! Frank. Frank, no. This is my cross to bear. Come on, Amy, let's go! Amy! The power of God cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits, who wander through the world- - What is that thing? It must be the campus' 5G hub. The energy frequency didn't allow me to pinpoint the location, but it's the only thing that makes sense and... And oh. Oh, I was wrong. They are doing a beta run on 5G. The quarantine, the pandemic, the lockdown, they needed to keep people inside, while they tested the full capacity of the network and ah, this is it. It's just like my forums predicted. But what is it, Bob? It's ah, 5G. They say once there's enough 5G cells in a cluster, the network will become so powerful, that the internet will be unlike anything we know. No more buffering, no more connecting to different networks, because there will only be one network, a one-world network. Some are calling it 5D, a five-dimensional internet. That sound, it's the signal. Zuri, what are you doing? I'm going where I belong, Bob, where we should all go. Look away, look away from it. There's nothing left here for me. Everything is through there. No, Zuri, you don't understand. No, you don't understand, I am the internet now. We need to get out of here. Amy! Yes, Bob? Where are you? I'm in the same place you are, just at a slightly different moment in time. Hello, Frank. Last summer, after graduation, I thought we were going to be together forever. The first few weeks of the semester were hard, but we made them work. Then Thanksgiving. After my parents' death, I just, I wanted to move on from that life, my old life. I love you, Amy. You know we can never be together, right, Frank? Not in this world, but we can in that one. You were right, there is another world, only it is far better than you ever could've imagined. We can be together again forever and ever and ever. Go, Frank, go toward the light. What's it like, Amy? I don't know. Then how can you? Because I believe. It's beautiful, Amy. It won't hurt you like it did him. Frank is from a different generation than us, he didn't grow up connected. The internet is existence. We are one fifth-dimensional being, observing humanity at the same time. You lived seven billion years last year alone. I-I'm not going into that thing. But Bob, you already did. You were the first. No. Amy, don't please. Ah, ah, ah, ah! ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Watching myself ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Watching myself ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Watching myself ♪ Hey.
