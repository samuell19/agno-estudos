Thomas! Come on kids... Julian! Come down! Hurry up. We're leaving, You've had enough. Julian! Thomas! That's enough! St Denis Bookshop - Hello Daddy. - Hello my darling. Hello Jules! - They've been unbearable. - That's not true. Tell what you did to the little girl. She hurt me. Another time... I've got an appointment. You never give them a thought. Kid problems are your department. I have my own. - I got it, come on kids! - No, we want to stay with dad. - Mom is going to buy you a lollipop. I have to work. Mummy will buy you a lollipop. We don't bribe them like that. Come on, out of here now! Out you go! - Behave yourselves. - I've got work to do. Be good... I'm busy. Could I have some money? - I've already given it to you. - We eat twice a day. - You buy twice? - No, I paid for the curtains. Who needs curtains? Hello! Is that your little brother? - No, she's my sister. - She's your sister! - We're two sisters. - Really? Cheerio pets! Bye. Will you give me 10,000 for curtain rods? You can hold them up yourself. Come on. 'Bye, kids. - Come on, Thomas, come on. The balance sheet isn't great. Your turnover isn't improving. The only progress is that you're paying less in tax. I'd rather the opposite. You'll sign me a cheque for family allowances... Health insurance... Old-age allowance... The pension fund... The pension fund and the old-age allowance...? I've already told you, it's not the same thing. When I'm old, I'll retire. You may be old, and still not retired. Come on, sign. When I understand... There's also a time-payment which hasn't been paid. - How much? - 4,022 francs. Then another 7 more, until February. What can be done? How much is left in my account? When you've paid me... You'll have 472 francs left. - That's your fee? - Yes, please sign. - Oh well! - As they say. You can't swing a cat in this shop! - Sell it. - And then? I repay my debts and my wife squanders the rest. Hire me as a maid. With what your wife spends in a day... ...I'll feed you for a week. Mum, please mind your own business. You've raised your wife well. Sorry, it was you who raised her. When you entrusted her to me, her education was well underway! This American stock exchange... ...it's up and down like an elevator! How do you like them? Lovely. Not bad. Where did you find the money for rods? I borrowed it from the caretaker. Here's to the caretaker! Caretaker! That's what I should have done! - Fed, heated, housed... - It's a good job. Thomas! What is he up to? You're going to bed, right? I want daddy tell me a story. - It'll wake up your brother! - We won't be loud. What about school tomorrow, then? Daddy, go tell him a story. Which story? Didn't your father tell you when you were little? You promise me you'll go to sleep after it? I doubt it. He's cute. Come and kiss your grandpa. Come on, come on! He's my treasure, he is. I adore this kid. Off to bed, Thomas. He really is cute. - Charming. Oh, he's cute! I think so! You weren't that cute when you were little. I'll read you a little more, and then I leave you. - Come on. - Daddy... No no... it's school tomorrow, kiddo. Do you want Daddy to sleep with you? Do you want Daddy go to bed with you? I put myself a little sleeping with you. Come on... You see, you woke him up, look at the result. Shall I have little sleep with you...? Come on, come here. Come on, don't cry. Don't cry. If necessary, I'll get a job. I'll look after the children. Why not? I had a good job before I knew you. Congratulations. We have everything we need to be happy. Within a few francs. Kiss me. Better. I'm not in the mood. Your heart's not in it? Don't you love me any more? Don't I have enough problems as it is? I've a payment of 4,000 due, with 7 more to follow, I don't know if we'll have enough to eat. And your only problem is to know if I love you? Yeah, that's all that matters to me. Silly, eh? According to you, either I love you or I don't love you? I don't know... ...This is my only solution... You don’t want me anymore? We're already little old people. Howdy, old boy! Well I'll be! This is a real surprise! A kiss? You didn't expect to see me! Well, I have to say... It's been at least 4 years. More. - How are you doing? - OK. You? Fantastic! Not OK... good... Very very good. - That's great. - And you? OK. Could be better. You got divorced? No, that side of things is fine. I'm married, two children. - So what's wrong? Business. Listen Claude, if you want, I'll lend you to repay your debts... I'll advance you for all you need for your shop... I'll provide you with the merchandise, and you'll become my first branch. Is the shop yours or do you have a lease? No, I just have a lease. Perfect! Don't even need permission... you stay in the same place! Whether you sell Proust or Positions, it's from the bookstore. If you also sell some gadgets, it doesn't matter. What's your landlord like? I've never seen him. I deal with the manager. It's even better! There is no problem with managers! All managers buy the stuff themselves. We'll give him a gift the end of the year. A free subscription to Playboy. Renewable, eh! What gadgets are you talking about? Vibrators,... ...inflatable dolls, playing cards, whips... Here's the big harness. SO... Like that. And then here... It's used to tie the hands behind the back... ...so as to keep the subject completely under control. This is the model that we sell the most. It goes like hot cakes. It's big, it's attractive, it's nicely decorated... - It's very aesthetic... - and functional! That's very important. But what's it for? The principle is to dress a body, and have it secured behind. To tie the hands to avoid any movement when whipping. - Whipping? - There's whipping. Because we whip! I'll tell you something... There are people who can break them. Tear the leather apart. Leather that's used to make harnesses for horses to pull ploughs. - Who is the girl? - Maria, she's my right hand... She's almost my muse. I create the model at the start. We try it, we develop it together... ...and it's made to order. She does everything by hand, in a traditional way. Here's a new model. This is the most beautiful one. It's beautiful. There's a problem. It's a boob harness... it's very beautiful... but since you can't tie... It doesn't work. And this is not a chastity belt... ...but a chastity chain. ...because the chain above the hips is secured with a padlock. That's good, because it has a functional side... ...blockage, impediment, something must be prevented. - It must hurt. - It's meant to hurt! Your customers must be crazy. No, why? I believe that everyone is free to do what he wants. As well as that... if you want to make love tied up, getting whipped... ...or standing on your head, it's a release. I claim it's better for letting off steam like that... ...than driving around chasing pussy of an evening. For me, it's great. It's almost a blessing. There's something special about it. Special, but... ...almost normal. That should get us some customers! Think so?. They're only perverts who go inside. So what? Do you have anything against it? Are you coming, darling? You see? He prefers his book... He can start over as often as he wants. It's still not the same. Look at that guy coming. He's the local dentist. He redid my dentures. - That's not bad. - Look at her. Come on. Who loves well caresses well. It would surprise many of our contemporaries... ...if we popularized the idea that they are conquerors of sexual pleasure. It's not utopian to think we're only in the infancy of this exploration. The modern couple is on the way to the conquest of pleasure. Let's dream a little. What will a loving embrace be like in 100 years, 200 years... ...if our progress in this area... ...matches that of scientific knowledge? Today, man is going to the moon. Who would have believed it? So who can say that tomorrow... ...love won't have made as much progress as science? Who can tell? And first of all, love is a science. A box of Activiril, please. - Of Acti...? - Of Activiril. Activiril... No, that's Stimulation 2. Ah, that's it. 88 francs. That's an introductory price. So. - Thank you sir. - Thanks. There is an infinity of feelings... ...able to attract a man and a woman to each other. A delicate chemistry occurs between them... ...with more or less suddenness, sometimes instantaneous. The desire is born. You will have to pass it on... ...make it noticeable to the chosen person... ...to be recognised, rejected or accepted. The eyes are the most direct and most efficient interpreters... ...of our intimate feelings. It is through them... ...you can make your emotion sensitive to the other person Nudity befits love and undressing... ...is a very pleasant exercise, if we avoid certain pitfalls... ...that the beginner sometimes ignores. Undressing must be done by two people. It is a principle that we transgress too often. Out of shyness, some women don't dare to be active in this activity. By laziness, by lack of dexterity... ...some men leave it up to their companion to undress alone... ...which is a big mistake. What are you reading? Eh? What are you reading? Nothing. The Caress Guide. It's good? Not bad. I know that the practice is sometimes inconvenient... ...and a reluctant bra... ...can distract both partners... ...making them forget their voluptuous intentions. It is recommended for the man... ...to regulate his kissing and caressing activity... ...least his partner forgets her own stripping activity. Indulge in rough treatment only with caution. Realise that some women prefer a soft approach. Nothing is more unpleasant for a woman... ...once the voluptuous paroxysm has passed... ...to discover that for the whole time... ...her partner kept his socks or undershirt on. Or both. Bob was snoring. Cerise was slowly stroking her belly. Suddenly, as if dizzy, she left the tent. The night was there, pitch black... ...only lit by the moon. Cerise advanced slowly, parting the branches... ...graceful, passing under the vines. Suddenly she stopped, guided by her instinct. Nervous, she sensed him behind her, lurking in the dark. Sure enough, he was there. Cry of surprise He kissed her. Quivering, she struggled, half mad, half happy. Her breath failed, her legs faltered. Now she was naked. He took her in his strong arms and took her away to lay her gently... ...on his bed. She wanted to turn off the propane lamp. He pushed her away, then he undid his belt. The belt buckle rattled against the sheath of his dagger. He leaned over her. Abandoned to his caresses, to his kisses, she smiled, conquered. He bit her shoulders, her nipples. She wanted to scream with pleasure. His mouth glided along her belly, slowly, surely. What are you thinking about? You. Liar. Get dressed. Don't be silly! I'll explain later. Go get dressed. - How should I dress? - As you were just now. - Completely? - Completely. Stay still. Are you sick or something? You're mad! Knowledge of sexual perversions is the basis of your profession. Most of your customers will come to consult you... ...to choose books relating to their deviation. So you have to satisfy them. I talk like that because I see you young, charming, helpless. I am an old collector erotic works. I have over 5,000 books! ancients, moderns... ...with or without illustrations. Bear in mind that I started my collection in 1912. I got my first book when I was 11 years old. I hesitated for a long time to become a merchant myself. But the idea of parting with any of my books was unbearable to me. I gave up. - Madam? - Excuse me, sir... Do you have any books related to rubber-fetish? Rubber fetishism? Yes, 'The Raincoat'. No, I've already read 'The Raincoat'. Pity. Do you know 'Education of a Cherub'? No. It's an admirable work on rubber fetishism. It's the story of a boy who is out sea-fishing... ...making love for the first time with a woman who kept the top on... ...of her frog-woman jumpsuit. This boy is marked for life. You don't have 'Education of a Cherub'? No, it's a title that I haven't seen. I can order it for you. That would be lovely. I can pay a deposit, If you want. No, pay me when you pick it up. I'll have it in 3 or 4 days. - Goodbye, gentlemen. - Goodbye Ma'am. There you are! What was I telling you? She's a rubber-fetishist. Another will be for necrophilia. A third will be buttocks-fetishism. Which is...? An extreme fondness for that part of the body. A guy who fondles his secretary's bum... Is he obsessed? No, he's a lout! Back to deviations. I want to educate you. Which ones do you know? Sadists... Masochists... Homosexuals. That's the most common. Do you know any others? No, I don't. Nothing? Bes... bes... - Bestiality! - Bestiality? Yes, it's sexual intercourse between humans and animals! There's voyeurism, transvestism, flagellation. That's my case. - Masturbation... - That too? According to Kinsey, 90 per cent of men and women interviewed masturbate. We can probably dismiss it. It'd mean that 90 per cent of men and women are deviant. However, of this 90 per cent... ...there are some that indulge so often... ...that we can consider them being deviant. - To that extent? - Yes, to that extent. - Hello Dad! - Hello! - Good morning Sir! - Yes, hello. Hello, Jules! - Say hello to the gentleman. - Good morning. We come to say hi, before going to the market. How nice. - How is business going? - Fine, thanks. My wife, my mother-in-law, Mr... Mr de la Grange. Pleased to meet you. Thomas! You silly boy! - That's enough! - You're a real brute. He fucks everything up and I'm the brute! Go to the market and let me work. The shop is forbidden to minors. Do you want to get it closed down? I want you to be nicer. Come on, kids. I'll stay a while. It amuses me. Don't be ridiculous! Act your age. Charming! - Good bye, Sir. - Goodbye Madam. - What do you want to eat tonight? - I don't care. It's okay, you won't get anything. - Give me a kiss. - No! Your children are delightful... Yummy. Thank you. 60 francs. Do you have The Magic Fly? Yes. 20 francs. Here. Thanks. Yes, I have this model. It attaches and it closes with a padlock. It's very good. I don't want it, I want the other one. - That one? - Yes. It's a chastity belt for man. Exactly, that's what I want. It's 600 francs. I'll take it. Hello... Are you the sex shop bookseller? My name is Jacqueline. I bought 'The Magic Fly' from you. Yes, I remember. That's nice of you to remember. With so many customers, it can't be easy. No, I noticed you. I noticed you too. I'm with my husband, we'd like to invite you to dinner with a friend. Yes with pleasure... I'm quite hungry. So we live at 8 Square des Innocents. It's on the 3rd floor, you'll see a "Dental Surgeon" sign. - What do you like? - Sorry? I mean what do you like to eat? I don't care, I'm not picky. - That's not nice for me. - Pardon? I'm kidding. So, we're waiting for you. I'm coming. I'll tell my wife and I'll be on my way. You're married? That's lovely. Why don't you bring her? She'll be most welcome. Uh... Yes, it's... That's it, yeah... See you later. See you soon. See you soon? I have to go with Bernard to Fontainebleau... ...to see a Japanese supplier. Fontainebleau? At this hour? Bernard has just arrived and let me know. The Japanese is suspicious and makes late appointments. Be careful, darling. Don't worry. I won't be back late. Love you. Sleep well. Do you know what we said to each other? With my wife, when we walked into your sex shop? We said to each other, to run a sex shop... ...you'd have to be terribly depraved. I don't think so. Well, I haven't noticed. Not yet. I have a sex shop, but I'm normal. He's cute. What's "being normal"? Doing what you want to do? If you do what you want, you are normal. If you want to be a depraved, it's normal. Isn't that true, my dear? What is not normal, it's not doing what you want to do. To not be a homo, if that's what you are. Not to swing both ways, if you want to. And keep your wife to yourself... ...if you want to lend her, is not normal. Speaking of wives, where is yours? He wouldn't lend her to me. No it's not that. She's child-minding. Poor thing. - Do you have a boy or a girl? - Two boys. Lucky. I have a girl and a boy. You're the lucky one. We always dreamt of having a boy and a girl. I always dreamt of having two little boys. You just have to swap. There's not enough swapping done. You don't say anything? You don't agree? I'm listening to you. You sure don't talk bullshit. She's shy when she doesn't know. Yes, when she doesn't know. How's your sex shop going? Business good? I just opened, but it's off to a good start. What do you sell the most? Books? Movies? Speaking of movies, someone brought me one from Amsterdam. - Oh yes! - Not bad at all. I sell a bit of everything, but especially books. Which ones do you sell the most? 'Positions', yes, that would be it. 'Positions 1' or 'Positions 2'? We no longer sell the 1st, red cover. Oh, well. I rather like the second one, it's more fun. The silent majority has classic tastes. Is it sold under the counter? Of course... it's banned for posting. That's a scandal. It doesn't make sense. It's an essential book that everyone should have. Essential. Those who need to read 'Positions' to get into position...! - It's a bit sad. - Yes, my darling... You're a true cordon-bleu! You will see. I've seen how good this dinner is. Thank you. According to 'Le Nouvel Observateur'... ...I cite my sources... ...they sold over 300,000 in a few weeks, under the counter. Can you imagine over-the-counter? All couples could profit from it. It's incredible what we can do together. And with four! - And with twelve! - There's no limit. It reminds me of the Meccano set that my father had given me. It was a number 1. I was just managing to build a crane. During the year, when I was in the top 10... ...I received extra boxes. Believe it or not... ...after two years, with my Meccano... ...in addition to the small crane... ...I managed to build two skyscrapers of 22 floors each... ...connected by a footbridge. Lovemaking is the same. It's a matter of numbers. The more people there are, the more spectacular the result. A small slice of cake? Yes, thank you. Lovemaking should be taught at school. From year 6, 2 hours per week, like gymnastics. Why only 2 hours? I said that for the 6th but you are right! But you are right! We have 8 hours of history and geography, which are useless... ...and we are not taught the essential in a man's life. - And a woman's. - In everyone's. This is the world we live in. If I proposed that in the Chamber of Deputies... ..it's me who'd be called crazy. Do you find that normal? Oh no... You're right. Imagine a normal world... ...where, from 12 years old, we'd learn to make love really well. Wouldn't that be great? I tell you right away. I like my job but then, I'd drop everything. I'd be a teacher. You'd keep me as your assistant. You, my darling, you'd have the chair of Love at the Sorbonne. You'd be an academic. - Go and propose to them. - Why not? If we don't hurry, it won't be worth it anymore. After midnight, it goes down. No, it's Friday, we have time. We're still going to get ready. Come on, Muriel. We'll leave you for 5 minutes man-talk. - Yes. We'll be better off sitting over there. Come on. - A small cognac? - Great, thanks. - Say when. - Just a finger. - Where are we going after? - The Emperor Marcel's. Marcel's? Don't you know it? You will like it very much. It's a discreet bar, near Paris. Unique in the world. You'll see! We won't be home late. Tomorrow we're going to Normandy. Come rain or shine, every week... ...we go there for the weekend. Generally, we leave on Friday but this is special. My wife wanted to meet you. Her friend too. You'll see, she's very very good. Me too, by the way. My dear Claude, I have two passions in life: Group sex... ...as 'Le Nouvel Observateur' would say... ...and Norman houses. I am a dentist, I really like my job. But my true calling... ...is restoring old farmhouses. This is my house near Honfleur. Here it is, before... And here it is, after. That was the attic before. Look now. Exposed beams, sofa, ambient light. That's my agency. I have an agency too. When I was done restoring for myself, I decided I'd restore for others. People are stupid, you have to take advantage of it. An old farm that I buy, with one or two million, I fix it up and I resell it on credit seven or eight, has cons. They have 20 years to pay for it, and they're delighted. So am I. Ah, this is... This is another thing... The more orgasms a woman has... ...the stronger they are... ...and the more she wants to have. Virtually any woman is sexually insatiable... ...whatever the heights she reaches. So what do you do? I'm asking you! What todo you do? Good evening. Good evening. So, Gilbert, how are you? Hold on, please. - Good evening. - Claudius. Veronique and Bob. Nice to meet you. What do you want? - Vodka-grapefruit. Give me a Scotch. What would you like? Lucien, would you like to take a look? It doesn't look bad from the side. Are you coming, my dear? Why don't you come? I feel good here. - What an amazing place. - For what? I must admit I've never seen a place like it. Try! Give me some ice cream, Veronique. It's Veronique, the boy's wife who opened the door. The bearded man is Bob, the cousin. Basically, the father... the founder of the club... 'The Emperor' Marcel. It's a family affair. Thank you, Veronique. - How are things? - Okay. She's nice. Does she also participate in the proceedings? It happens. In the afternoon when there is not much going on. - It's a scandal? - Terrible. Mr Lucian. This afternoon, I thought of you. The Belgian woman of times gone by, came without her husband. - She had it 12 times. - No! - Are you having a drink? - Just a drop. Veronique, a glass. Her husband showed up at 8 o'clock. I gave him my report. So you're going to have fun. There was a dispute. I tell him 12, I counted 12. La Belge disagreed. She claimed it was 13. I tell her "I counted 12." The proof, this afternoon, we had 12 customers. “And you?” she says. I'd forgotten myself, Mr Lucien. Because the husband asks you to keep accounts? Sure. If he's not there to keep them himself. It's common. Mr Lucien, do you remember that time with Madame Jacqueline? I'd noted 17 guys. - 18! - She said 18. Then, it wasn't me... it was a guy who'd had 2 sessions I couldn't guess. Sometimes, in the afternoon, I'm alone. I'm busy behind my bar, and things escape me. - Isn't that it? - Guess so. - Want any more? - No! - Honey, I forgot to call Grandma. - Go ahead. - What time is it? - Ten to eleven. Can I make a call, please? Feel free. Veronique! Phone. Thanks. - I'll turn the music down for you. - Thanks. Dad! - We need to order 5 cases of beer. - 5 cases. - And fruit juices? - No, that's it. Hello, grandma? Did I wake you up? No my darling. I'm with Grandpa, watching TV. I couldn't call you earlier because we worked late. - How are the little ones? - Very very good. - Did Serge eat his porridge? - All his porridge. And Carole was good? Very good. She ate her yogurt. - And also two little Swiss. - Fine, give me Grandpa. - Kids OK? - Yes Dear. Everything's fine. Hello, are you okay? Very well and you, dear grandpa? Very good. Serge ate his porridge... ...and Carole, her yogurt and also two little Swiss. Poor grandpa. For him, I'm his granddaughter,. He bounces me on his knee. I should come and see you. I have a sore tooth. - Give me a call. - I don't like the dentist. - I have a gentle touch. - Good. Who's that dancing with Madame Jacqueline? A guy who runs a sex shop. It seems to be working. Away we go! Oh yes, yes, yes... - I can't do it. - What's the matter? In front of everyone, I can't. How cute are you. They're very nice, they won't hurt you. No, I can't, in front of everyone. Do me a favour, come. No, Emile. Don't force me. I like you. Precisely, if you like me, come. Please don't force me. Too bad for you. I'm going alone. Emile... Stay here. Behind me. Balance... Decadence... Let your hands... fondle my breasts... And my heart... which is yours ...my love... Always Patience Decadence Under my fingers That was quick. - He couldn't. - What? Is he impotent? When he saw us, he couldn't. He's not used to it. When you're here for the first time. Got to get used to it. It's weird. He's past the age of flirting. Don't worry, it'll work out. - Like a drink? - No thanks. I've had enough. But it's weird. I'll be back. - Where are you going? - Give me the car keys. - She's great, isn't she? - Ah, Madame Jacqueline! Isabella, I love you. Japanese? Which Japanese? Ah yes, the Japanese. It went well. Did you have dinner? Yes thanks. Isabella, I love you. Me too. I lied to you tonight. I didn't have an appointment with a Japanese. You cheated on me? No. - You know I'd never cheat on you. - Who with? A customer of the shop. Is she beautiful? Not bad. Why did you lie to me? I didn't dare tell you on the phone. I didn't cheat on you. I love you. You're the woman of my life. Kiss me. Kiss me. She was beautiful? Not terrible. Bastard. Don't push, don't push! Good morning sir. I'm sorry madam, we're looking for someone younger. I'm very good. Yes but we are looking for a 20 year old saleswoman... ...and you're not 20 anymore. I thought that with my experience, I would interest you. You've worked in a sex shop? No, but for more than 20 years, I was in the public bathhouse. So... I'm sorry. What's the matter with the bathhouse? Mum, think about it. What do you do in a bathhouse? -You wash yourself. That's it. - I must be very stupid. - Good morning. Miss. Are you an adult? And vaccinated, yes, sir. Have you already worked in a bathhouse? There are two speeds. Vibrates... 1st gear... Slower vibrations 2nd gear. It lights up. And the vibrations are smoother. Good... No risk of electric shock? None at all. The voltage is very low, no risk of electrocution... ...despite the absence from any earthing. - How much is it? - 200 francs. Guaranteed for one year. Registered trademark. Yes... Do you have a cheaper model? No, it's too small. This one... Guaranteed six months but there's only one speed. Oh yes? No, I prefer the large one. No, not this one. The pink one. I prefer it. Thanks. - I can help you? - What's this? It's a very effective product to delay ejaculation. Several customers have told me that they were very satisfied. Thanks. And this? Stimulage 2... It boosts performance. I'm coming. Wait for me outside. You love me? - And you? - I love you. How's business? Are you coming, honey? Can't you see it's a woman? - You kidding? - How much do you bet? - A dinner at Maxim's? - Yes. You're right, it's not late, I'm going to see my mother. Good evening. Not too late, tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye, Karine. You can tell us, can't you? We bet dinner at Maxim's. It's expensive there. These ladies are asking whether I'm a girl or a boy. What should I answer? Well I'll be...! These are peculiarities that every couple must discover. Because there are no rules apart from this... Nothing that allows the couple ...to achieve positive excitement and orgasm... ...should not be considered perverse or reprehensible. Here the man sits with the woman sitting on his lap. Her legs are apart. The woman has the active role. The position of the man's hands can involve him in this activity. If the woman rests her feet on the floor... ...which depends on the seated position of the man, to be possible... ...penis penetration distance is reduced. Ouch, you're hurting me! How? - You hurt me. - To be good, it must hurt. It's not very good for me. I'm not perverted. It's not perverted. This is a recommended position. - Either you make love normally... ...or you go find someone else. - Everyone makes love like this. - I doubt it. You're not normal. Go get someone normal then, because I don't want any more. When you made love with your doctor you weren't so particular. You're a brute! - I'm the brute? - Shut up! You made love with your doctor or not? - Are you interested? - Yes, I'm interested! - I didn't! - Liar... Dirty liar! You would've liked it. But I didn't do it! Why did you tell me? Because since you got your sex shop, you've gone nutty. It excites you, eh! That's it! I'm tired of your stories, your readings, your films and your positions. - My love... - Don't touch me! Do not touch me! Go do your junk with your normal women! I've come for a book that my wife ordered. It's a book on rubber fetishism. - Do you know the title? - 'Memoirs of a Cherub'. Right. 30 francs. Book-signing Friday 21 November You know the difference between a call girl and us? The same as a normal taxi and a radio taxi. If I had a good memory, I could write my memoirs. I want to buy her book. - Let's go! - Come on! "For Miss Keka, respectful tributes from the author.” There. Did you write it alone? Pardon? Did you write it by yourself? We've got some great memories. Like having a nigger. This is kids stuff. Go tell it somewhere else. Leave me alone and let me sign my books. Don't get high and mighty with us, just because you wrote a book. You and I are no different from each other. We ask you nicely. Kindly answer us. Just get lost, you grannies! I just want to be left in peace. Your bra... did you leave it in your car? The difference between you and me is that I don't need it. Neither do I! Who wants to see? It's free. You can keep this drivel of yours! - What's the matter? - The dirty-book seller! Piss off! - Go and sit on this! - What's the matter? I ask her nicely if she wrote her book alone ...or if she got herself a co-writer, and she gets angry. Yes, she wrote it herself. She's a writer. - What did she say? - It's clear... She's saying she can give us the address of a good nigger. We've got memories to reveal. Not those of a call-girl. So what, Dad? It's a bit of fun, right? - Aren't these memoirs funny? - Yes, they're funny... You don't sound amused. Nearly 4 o'clock, in 10 minutes I'll pick up the children. Would you feed them if I'm not back. Basically, you're a pornography publisher. I've done Balzac too. We're all pornographic publishers. "All publishers are German pornography publishers." Like "we are all German Jews." "There are only German pornography publishers." Because that's what they suspect. It's the pornography of society that we destroy. Actually, it's politically that they're embarrassed. You know it for yourself, and all those hit by censorship measures... ...have been at the ground level of eroticism. Massu wasn't censored, We have to mention Massu, if we're talking about perversion... ...because we're in a sex shop. Here are Massu's weapons. Here is his coat of arms. A silly face on the back of handcuffs. I'm surprised, I didn't know you did that. Listen my dear friend, I worked for six years at Madame Jeanne... ...who took half of what I made. You'll see in my book. I got tired of it. Now it's me who makes others work. It was easy with my address book. Like that. - And... I.. - Yes. - Can we call you? - For what? It interests you? It's very very easy. All you need is my number. Hello, Madame Irene? Speaking. Hello. It's the bookseller of the sex shop where you did your signing. I guess you're not calling me for my book. What can I do for you? What do you like? Big ones, little ones, brunettes, redheads? For this afternoon, I have a beautiful blonde,... ...very comfortable in bed. They're my sons. That's Thomas. He's the eldest. He's 5 years old. This is Julien, he'll be 4 in June. How pretty are they. I'd love to have two boys. They're very cute. Very good-looking. That's my wife. She's pretty. How pretty is she. - Did someone just come in? - It's nothing. It's Ingrid, my girlfriend. She lives with me. She works all week home from Germany. Do you mind if she joins us? It's her day off. No, not at all. That's Ingrid. That's Claude. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Thee are my sons. This is Thomas, the eldest, and Julien, the smallest. That's my wife. Very pretty. Who do you want it from? From you. And besides me? From you. But apart from me? You tell me. I want another woman with us. What would you do to her? I'll take her while you kiss her. How would you take her? - How'd you like me to? - Don't know. With an acrobat like you... - We start again? - No. Isn't it good with me? Yes. Then why do you want another woman with us? - It'll be even better. - You think so? We can try. And another man. No way. If there's another woman, there's no reason there can't be a man. It's even better. Could you cheat on me? If you ask me nicely, yes. You're sure? You won't have any regrets? Won't you come and cry afterwards? No... I promise you. Double Scotch. Can I invite you to dance? Yes. - Dance? - No. - Your feet hurt? - No, they're fine. - Like to dance? - No thanks. - Like to dance? - No thank you. - You dance? - No. - Why not? - Don't want to. You don't want to dance, or not want with me? Both. - Are you sure? - Certain. It's not okay, alright? Enough! Go get treatment, you sicko! Sex maniac! It's not particularly well paid. I was going to leave then the police intervened. They inflated the story. - You dance, Miss? - No thanks. - Come Dance. - I said no. Come on... - She said no. - You shut up. - How... - I'm telling you shut up! I tell you shut up! - Stop | - I'm telling you shut up! No, stop it, he's my husband. Help! Help! Now, are you happy? Do you always want us to be wrong? I love you. If you hadn't held me back, I would've smashed him. It's true that you're the strongest. Do you love me? I hate you, I can't look at you. It's your fault. You wanted another man. I just wanted a woman. If instead of dancing, you'd helped me, we would have got one. Should I help you now? No, but... Start the conversation and you introduce me. And what do I tell him? "Here's my husband, he wants to sleep with you." - That's it? - No. You say... You say: "You don't find it's hot?" "Let's go have a drink at home?" Original. Do you or don't you want to spice up our sex life? Listen, my darling, I'm a submissive woman. If you want a harem, okay. On one condition... Don't get them pregnant. You can bring them all back but you find them yourself. You go out... and you say: "You don't find it hot in here?" "How about a drink at my place?" And I'll be waiting for you here. You're kidding me, but you'll see. What am I going to see? You'll see, when I bring one back. Will you agree? Only if she's pretty. "You don't find it hot in here?" "Let's go have a drink at home with my wife?" What's up with you? And with you?! Thank you darling. - That's it, Dad. - The good guys. You're not eating? One lost fiance... ten found? No, I'm tired of guys. Tired of guys? Really? Honey, don't you want to see if you can't find fresh cream? - For your diet, it's perfect. - Tonight is special. Don't be silly. Just one. Not even a half. I have my wife's permission. Good for you, but that's not the point. Where is the point? Karine. Do you want some fresh cream? I don't mind, Isabelle. So... I love baked apples with fresh cream. - Don't you? - Me too, yes. You spoil him like a pasha. That may be truer than you realise. A pasha without a harem. It will come, it will come, my dear. Eat your baked apple... ...with good fresh cream. And when you're grown big, you'll have your harem. Darling... She doesn't believe that I have the right to flirt with her. Yes, I believe you. Only, I believe I have a word to say in the matter. That's true. I hereby authorise and the victim is Karine. THANKS. You're doing well to make me happy. Karine may be the victim and you may find your happiness there. I don't want her to be a victim. She's just got away from a brute. I want to console her. That's how I'll find my happiness. What a story. I didn't believe in answering the ad, that I'd have a charming boss... ...with such a pleasant wife... ...also desirable. If I bother you, you say so. If you continue, I'm leaving. You don't like my husband? He's very nice. But I don't like boys. I like you. I don't like girls. You should try. Easy to say. Yes, it's easy. - That's enough. - Just once. That's enough! You can look but not touch. I can touch my wife, can't I! - When I'm gone. - Come on, get out. There are limits! It's this way and only this way. Your husband is impossible. Get out, let's forget this evening. Don't come too late in the morning. Goodbye, Isabella. Good bye, sir. Goodbye, Karine. I'll see you out. Like me to take you home in a taxi? No. Some fresh air will do me good. Kiss your wife for me. I'll do that for sure. You should have been more patient. You ruined everything. You weren't upset. It wasn't unpleasant. Get dressed, go join her. Silly. Definitely. They won't be going wild inside? The neighbours won't be a bother. Look, I have a nice hi-fi system. And quite expensive, by the way. Not bad eh. How do you like it? I have a cellar as well. Come and see. Go on, make yourself at home. We'll send flyers to all our customers... ...write to all our contacts... If we don't have 2 or 3,000 members within 3 months... ...my name's not Bernard. They could exchange their ideas and even their good wives? They'll love it. Here's to "Club Love". To "Club Love". Miss... I'd like to join "Club Love". Yes, but you must have made at least 200 francs in purchases in the year. It's on the back of the prospectus. Oh yes... 200 francs of purchase in the year. - Excuse me, I hadn't read it. - No problem. My respects, Miss. - No military discount? - No. Yes, it's not like the railways. An inflatable doll who gives sex... 85. - "Make Love to Me". - 21. - "Cecilia". - 35. - "My Longest Night". - 30. - "Hefty". - 40. 201 francs, sir. - Here, now, Now you can sign me up "Club Love". Of course, with pleasure. It's 100 francs more, for the annual fee. Or 75 francs for six months. For this price, can I take my wife? But of course. So in that case, give me a card for a year. Change your partner. Oh, a very rare beauty! Jealousy is a cruel mistress. Change your partner. I didn't introduce you to my wife. - Hello. - Hello. My wife, Yvette. Madam. Hello Hello. My name is Albert. - Come on, some atmosphere! - Claudius! - How's it going? - Like a rocket. I no longer know where to put them. - How much have you made? - At least 300,000. Fantastic! And the cruise? The cruise? 2 cabins short of being full. - I told you. I'm going to dance. - Have fun. On the rare times when I cheated on my wife... ...it bothered me terribly. I pity men who lead a double life. Having to take precautions, and lying, always lying. Accept the sordid hotel room. The look of the doorman. So... Six years ago, I asked myself... ...all the questions that a 40 year old man can ask himself... ...who cares about his wife. It seems that a husband who can resist temptations... ....doesn't have that kind of problem. That's not my case. My husband, yes, alas. It's a question of glands, believe me. So I thought about it, and in the end... ...I offered my wife a solution... which we've adopted. The ideal for me, is to get together with a couple of our own age... ...with whom we can talk and dance and... ...search together for the eroticism we all need. The sexual act cannot reach its true size-full potential... ...if it takes place in an atmosphere of erotic research. That is the main thing. I must admit that sometimes in our get-togethers... ...we just have a drink. Without necessarily... ...necessarily getting physical. Your story is similar to ours, but back-to-front. My wife started things, by deceiving me. Fair enough, she had reasons. Why don't you take the cruise? What cruise? For Easter. 'Club Love' is organising a cruise in the Mediterranean. My daughter didn't tell me anything about it. Come on, Rose, time to go home. It's past 2am. For once I'm having fun, I'm staying. Don't force me to make a scene. Do whatever you want... I'm staying! - Is he your husband? - He's my son-in-law. It's nice of you to come see us. We haven't seen much of you tonight. Here... Drink from my glass... You'll get to know all my thoughts. So, is the cruise organised? Another 2 cabins and it's sold-out. It's a wonderful idea. I've a feeling we'll not be bored. - You coming too? - Of course. - Are you taking your wife? - I can't guarantee it. - She's hesitating. - No reason to hesitate. Your wife is charming. We'd be very disappointed if she didn't come. The sea air will stimulate her, inspire her. - It's now or never. - Come on, let's dance. No, not just now, because... My mother-in-law is there and I just wish she would go home. Which one is she? The woman in red. Really? She's superb! If I had a mother-in-law like that... She has to be on the cruise! That'd be the ultimate! My mother-in-law on the boat. Does she get seasick? That's a nice pair of boots. Am I bothering you, Claude? Honestly, tell me, do I bother you? No, you don't bother me. Yes, I feel I'm bothering you. I'll leave you to get on with it. I'd like to make you an offer. You lend me yours, and I'll lend you mine. Come on, eat. I'll go on a hunger strike until you let me out. - Eat. - No! Oh my pet... Monique, come on, don't be shy. - OK? - Why don't we go to your cabin? Come on... enough fooling around. Yes, come on. Good? Come on, come on. Let me go! Let me go! I tell you, let me go! Cheers. - Do you want a hand? - Ah, here you are! Now we're a foursome... ...eh, kids? Now now, little lady... Come along! Isabelle! Isabelle! Come on, my little lady. - Wait a moment. - Leave me alone. Don't be afraid. I'm very sweet. - I don't care for your sweetness. - Isabelle! - I love you, Isabelle. - You go back. You look good. Excuse me. So, shall we go? Let's go down... it's cold here. I very much need to have normal contacts... ...sensible men like you. Are you sure... ...that he always wears a raincoat with another? Yes, I'm sure. He only ever cheats on me with the raincoat. I must have been around 12. We lived with my parents near Fontainebleau. One Sunday, I was walking with my nanny whom I adored. A storm broke, an incredible storm... We took shelter under a big oak tree... ...and my nurse hid me under her raincoat to shelter me. And then the... ...the warmth of her body... ...and that smell of rubber which intoxicated me... When I recall this memory, this smell... Nobody can understand what it evokes in me. Oh yes... ...I understand very well,... it's Proust's madeleine. It's Proust's madeleine, exactly. I wasted my best years with you. For 30 years, I've remained faithful! You'll see when we get back! Eat slowly... think about your ulcer! It's not an ulcer that I have, it's a wasted life! Why? Why... why... Why what? At least try. Listen... I told you not to insist. Why? Because I don't wish to. What does "wish" mean? I don't know. Do I "wish" for you? I don't know what's wrong with me. I still want you. You're pretty. Don't worry about it. Yet we're alone. I don't know what's wrong with me. Are you mad at me? Have a drink and forget about it. I don't know what's on my mind. I don't know what's on my mind. I know I feel it in my heart. And in your stomach? - Also. - Well, that's love. Here he is. Isabelle, my love. Take off your top... Quickly! - I know you're there. - Turn around. Let me in, Isabelle. Please. Get out quickly. Be nice. Good luck. I love you, Isabelle. What a wife is quite a woman! You'd do this to me?! Did you fuck mine well? You okay, darling? What's wrong? Don't look at me like that. You're disgusting! That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Aren't you happy now? Get out now! And we'll be treated as crazy, abnormal? Hey, big girl... It's just not right. - Hey... - What Do you see what I see? - What, sailors? - Docks. Go touch their pompoms... it will bring us good luck. Man was created by God, in His image. Through pornography, Man lowers himself to the beasts. Pornographers, you are the oppressors of youth. We will no longer allow you to vent your frustrations... ...your fears, your failures. Know that a sexually happy individual... ...is not aroused by the sexual acts of others. We pity you for your unfulfilled desires. Shame on you, shame on pornographers. Shame on pornographers! Come on, outside. - I'm 15 years old. - Then outside. You also. - Go look in Gibert's... - Police. I'll spare you the desire to read pornographic books. - You weren't about to sell them any?. - They just came in! - Are they minors? - I was just getting them out. - Are they minors? - Yes, I'm not denying it. - All I'm hearing is they're minors. - Yes. Okay, then, shut down! Come on, come and eat. The vice squad already fed me. No more with the sex. I was fed up, so it's good. The cash will disappear, but all's well that ends well. I'll get a job, we'll sell my ring, We'll get over it in time. With time, we could do anything. In time, I could emerge as a political leader. Mao must work as well as sex. Think about what you'd like to do. What I like, that's what works. The sex business was good. I liked it, it worked. I combined the useful with the pleasant. You socialised with your dirty-minded customers and sluts. What's wrong with being dirty-minded? We're all dirty-minded. There are those happy to be dirty-minded and people like me. They are not happy to be dirty-minded. There's no chance. We're all dirty-minded. Claude, I'm the only real slut. - Really? - Come and sit down. Eat... it's going to be cold. It's dumplings... like your mother made for you, kiddo. Before you became a dirty old man. On the waterfront, I started young. It's not bad but it's not right. So I have to make the dumplings as well as your mother? Have sons who look like your father... Be a faithful mother... And do acrobatics in bed for you. - What else do you want? - A little salt. Why did you cheat on me? You led me to understand that it made you happy. Was I wrong? No, you weren't wrong. You cheated on me but you were not mistaken. What has to be done to make you happy? Nothing my dear, nothing. Not much. Succeed with the dumplings... And have a little imagination, from time to time. And even... Tell me... What did he do with you? Was it good? It was good. He took me slowly. Gently. It was good. What else did he do to you? Tell me. He kissed me. All over my body. Everywhere. Everywhere? Get off me! I don't want to know what he did to you. Go away. Claudius... It's not true, I didn't cheat on you. I swear. I didn't cheat on you. I love you. I love you. Tell me. What did he do to you? I'm telling you that I didn't cheat on you. I love you. It doesn't matter, tell me. Tell me anyway. He took me. Slowly. It was good. He kissed me. Everywhere. All of my body. Slowly. Gently. It was good. Tell me, little slut, tell me... How it was in his arms? Was it better than with me? Yeah, little vixen, tell me everything. How many times, how often did you come? Not until the end? No, little bitch, you're lying to me. I didn't do the same to you... ...that you pretend to me... But, bitch, it doesn't matter... Make up another story about his hands his hands again... On your belly and your breasts... Anyway, you didn't do that to me? It's not true... Tell me it's not true... Say it, little slut, say it again... How it was in his arms? Was it better than with me? But, little bitch, if you told me true I won't forgive you I swear to you, never! Liar... Liar... Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
