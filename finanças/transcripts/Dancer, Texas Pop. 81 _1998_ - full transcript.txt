Y'all listen to this. Rand McNally and Co., 150 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022. Dear Mr. McNally, -I called our company about... -Think there really is a Mr. Rand McNally? Sounds like one of those made up company names to me. Y'all, it's called Rand McNally and Company. Called you company about putting our town Dancer, Texas on... -Could be dead. -Yeah, so could you, Squirrel, shut up. I called your company about putting our town Dancer, Texas on your maps. The lady on the phone said for me to write this letter giving you more information about our town, anything worth knowing. -This won't take long. -No kidding. Dancer is in West Texas. It sits smack dab in the middle of Brewster County, the largest county in the United States, larger than the state of Connecticut, even. On your Rand McNally road map, Brewster County takes up eight square inches. It's that big blank area just east of El Paso. Most of the county's 6,000 folks live in Alpine, some 80 miles away. Dancer's isolated location makes it the perfect spot for the weary traveler. And one hell of a boring spot to grow up in. Y'all going to let me finish this or not? Continue. Dancer sits just off old Highway 90, which used to be the major thoroughfare until they built the interstate 200 miles north. -The commercial district... -Commercial district! (LAUGHING) -The commercial district has... -I like that! The commercial district has a general store where you can always find plenty of hearty food stuffs, -useful hardware, and local characters. -Character part's right. There's a restaurant offering fine dining and a friendly atmosphere and plenty of available retail space for lease. Other buildings of note include a church, of course, and the school. 24 students attend grades six through 12. Today, Saturday, is an especially big day because the largest senior class in 20 years, five students, is graduating. ALL: Yee-haw! That's all I can think to tell you about Dancer. I ought to mention that the population figure is fixing to change pretty drastically 'cause four of us, all four guys graduating today, are leaving town on the bus first thing Monday morning. Sincerely, Keller Coleman. So what do y'all think? Car. What's the matter? You don't like the letter? Well... sounds like you don't much care for the town. Didn't ask me if I liked it or not. He just wanted information. I liked it. The letter, I mean. Yeah, Squirrel, you would. I tell you, Keller, the way you talk about this town, if I was Mr. Rand McNally, I wouldn't put it on the map either. You should tell him why Dancer's important, you know, special. -Give reasons. -I would have, if I could've thought of any. Must be some. (LAUGHING) Well, tell you what. I'll hold off sending the letter in case we think of any. You know, Keller, maybe it isn't such a hot idea, putting in the letter that the four of us are leaving, and all. Yeah, Terrell Lee's right. Makes it sound like we're leaving town because we don't like it here. Well, aren't we? Guess we ought to get to graduation. Ain't starting without us. We are sort of the feature attraction. We got to go soon anyway with that car coming. Come on. -Let's go graduate. -All right. Squirrel, you sit right there. Heads up! It's about to begin. This is the first day of the rest of their lives, so we are filled with pride as these five young people set sail on that adventure called life. So without further ado, I now pronounce you high-school graduates. (CHEERING) WOMAN: Hi, you want some? Have some of this... This is my momma's... Thanks for everything. (GRUNTING) Josie! -Josie, don't strangle your brother. -Mom! Thank you, ma'am. You did good. Thank you, sir. Well, let's eat. -We're all real proud of you, son. -Thanks. Hey! Mom! What are you wearing? Can't I dress up to see my only son graduate from high school? Well you're going to look a little silly trying to balance a paper plate of fried catfish on your lap. Oh hush! We wouldn't dream of having supper here. Would we, honey? No, ma'am. My friends are waiting. I hope you broke the news to them. Terrell Lee. I promised them. They can't go to L.A. without me. We have discussed this. You're making me ruin all my plans. It's not fair. Dad! This is between you and your mother, just leave me out of it. Well, at least let me go with them for a month or two till they get settled in. You are going to work for your father Monday morning, no ifs, ands or buts. This family has had oil for blood going back generations, Terrell Lee. It is a part of you and you will learn to love it. You'll see. Now, your Daddy has got to say hello to all the men who work for him. You be sure to come back and say goodbye to us before we leave. I thought about leaving town. I had a brother-in-law who did. He was just about your age. He went out to California, too. You sure remind me of him. Yeah? I'll look him up. He died a few years back, murdered in prison. Thank y'all. Leave some room for the catfish. Squirrel, you just don't get enough vegetables. Look at those scrawny arms! When you get to California, you be sure and eat plenty of vegetables. I bet they don't even eat vegetables out there. I heard they eat nothing but. Well then you be sure and get enough good red meat, too. Yes, ma'am. Thank y'all. I want some of that catfish. Your boy looked real good today. Thank you. How're you doing this year? Getting by. You? Same. Well, see you. Good talking to you. Hey, Keller! Come over here, son. Hi, Dale. Keller. So, you boys still set on leaving? Yes, sir, all four of us are leaving on the bus first thing Monday morning. Awful damned sure, ain't he? Not as easy as you think, leaving. When we was your age, we thought about leaving. Still thinking about it. No, see for us it's all decided. See, when we were 11 the four of us promised after we graduate to leave town together on the first bus. Uh-huh. We made a solemn vow. Oh, a solemn vow. -Well, hell, that's different. -Must be where we messed up. We skipped the solemn vow part. Talking about leaving is one thing. Folks get fed up with the place. It's natural. But actually picking up and taking off well, that's something else. What is today, Saturday? A lot can happen between now and Monday morning. It's put up or shut up time for you boys. The four of us are going. We really are. Keller, don't be disappointed if things don't turn out the way you hoped. Some folks don't belong in a small town. Some folk don't belong anywhere else. Good luck now, Keller. Didn't mean to be discouraging or nothing. -No. -Sure hope we weren't! No, it's okay. Hell, I'd be surprised if one of them left. No more than two, definitely. Maybe three. I smell betting opportunities here, fellows, major betting opportunities. 20 dollars says one leaves. 30 on two. You got it. -More pie? -Third plate's a charm. Howdy, Squirrel. Say, we were wondering... Now, Vivian, she's a senior. Jean and Loretta are the only juniors. Ain't no sophomores. Three freshmen, all guys, so all y'all is saying is there's four guys, just three girls. Am I right? Now if that ain't bad enough, looks to me like Terrell Lee goes steady with two of the girls. Am I right? I wouldn't stand for it. SQUIRREL: Yeah, but he's been telling me all along that he's going to break up with one of them, when the time's right. How long's he been telling you that, Squirrel? Since we were 13... I wouldn't stand for it. Looks to me like he kind of took advantage. I just wouldn't stand for it. Squirrel. Howdy, Reverend. We've missed you in church these last few years. (LAUGHING) Well, I been kind of busy at home. Excuse me. -Terrell Lee. -Hey, Squirrel, sit down. How come everybody a girl around here except for me? -Howdy. -Hey, Josie. Will you do us all a favor? Will you go out with Squirrel? (LAUGHING) No way. That's just great, getting shot down by a 12-year-old. Come on, Squirrel. Sit down before you drop something. Hey, Keller, I don't see your grandpa. He's probably sitting on the porch in his underwear with a fly swatter wondering where everybody is. I haven't seen my dad in two days. He'll turn up Squirrel, always does. Doesn't bother me... not really. Tonight we got cousins coming in from Midland. Why don't you have supper with us, Keller? You got girl cousins? (LAUGHING) I got to get back to the station. You're working tonight? Need all the money we can get for L.A., right? I guess. We'll be by later for the sunset. Terrell Lee, you and me, we gotta talk. I bet you don't none of them leave. How much? Come on, Terrell Lee. -When are you gonna break up with one of them girls, huh? -Aw, Squirrel. Jean, Loretta, either one. For five you been telling me you was gonna break up with one of them. I will. I promise. I'm just... waiting for the right moment, that's all. How about right now? Seems as good a moment as any. Oh, man, I don't know, with graduation and all. I don't want to spoil their mood. What about my mood? We're leaving town in two days, Terrell Lee. Well there you go. No sense in breaking up with one now. What's the point? I'm just trying to be considerate of the girls' feelings, that's all. Squirrel! Come on, Squirrel! We're leaving now, honey. We'll see you back up at the house. -I'm going over to the gas station later. -Did you tell them? What? Did you tell them? Terrell Lee, it is not fair for you to lead them on. Now you march right over there and you tell them you're staying, you understand? I can't. Not now. Tonight then. Mom, it's just not that easy. Well then explain it to them. Friends are friends, but family is family. Now, you have responsibilities as a Lusk, you here? Yes, ma'am. Tonight, Terrell Lee. SQUIRREL: You know what I'm gonna do first thing when we get out to L.A.? I'm going to sit on that corner... What's that famous corner you talk about? -KELLER: Hollywood and Vine. -Hollywood and Vine. Watch all them movie stars walk by. You got it, Squirrel. Damn it, we graduated today. We should do something, something big, really cut loose. Like what? -Good point. (LAUGHING) Think the four of us can just show up there and get jobs just like that, huh, Kell? Lot easier there than here, more interesting jobs, too. Waitering, bartending, pizza delivery. I'd do that. We don't know the first thing about L.A. I've done nothing but research it for two years. That's a whole lot different than being there. Seems like everybody we know knows about somebody went out there once and something awful happened to them. What makes you think it's gonna be any different for us? 'Cause there's the four of us going. That's the beauty of it, all four of us going, looking after each other. That's why we made the solemn vow to stick together. -What's with you all of a sudden? -Nothing. -Terrell Lee, I've been thinking. -Uh oh. No, I'm serious. About this whole girl hogging situation that's been going on. Now, these are my dating years and you are stunting my personal growth. (LAUGHING) Look, you're leaving town on Monday. It's the principal of the thing! I'm serious. If you don't... if you don't break up with one of them girls this minute, right now, I'm going to be forced to do something drastic. (LAUGHING) No, y'all, wait. I wanna hear what drastic things Squirrel's gonna do. What are you gonna do, Squirrel? I'm gonna take one of those girls away from him. I'm gonna charm her, and hustle her, and woo her. Before you know it, she's gonna be mine. All right, Squirrel! Now, Squirrel, I'm hurt. I thought we were friends. Of course we are! We're the best of friends, Terrell Lee. I hope we can still be friends! I don't want to do this to you. You're forcing me to do it. Which girl you gonna go after, Squirrel? I don't care! I'm gonna chase after both of them, see which one comes around first. -Oh, Squirrel, you little heart breaker. -That's right. Tell you what, Terrell Lee. If Squirrel winds up with both those girls, you only have yourself to blame. That's right. I guess I'll just have to learn to live with it. No, Terrell Lee, I hope you realize I didn't want to do this to you. I understand, Squirrel. Hey, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, right? -Right. -Good luck. Taking it like a man. All right, then. Well, it's closing time I guess. What you wanna do now? Come on. Come on, heartbreaker. Hey, I got it. Let's go on a beer run. It's silly to drive 100 miles one way for a six-pack of beer. It's not our fault we live in a dry county. We could go for a drive. Hey, where we going? We're driving. Come on, y'all, we just graduated! Let's go do something wild and crazy. Woo hoo! Any ideas? Great. Terrell Lee, slow down. Can't this thing go faster? (LAUGHING AND JOKING) Look at your gas gage. It's almost on empty. Oh, come on, we got plenty. Shoot. Come on, turn around. He's right, Terrell Lee. We're a long way from town. Okay, okay, fine. I had no idea that that little arrow could go so far below the E. Can't believe we're still moving. You know, I think we're gonna make it. We're still 20 miles from town. You know what I think? I think this gage is off. I think we still got plenty of gas. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) I think that gage is off. (ENGINE RATTLING) If we sit here long enough, somebody's bound to come by sooner or later. I don't recall seeing a car on this road all night. Do you? Nope. Looks like we walk. Well, this is great. This is just great. (ENGINE RATTLING) It's my fault. I'll go back into town and get help. Whoa, wait a minute. If we go back and get help, this is gonna be all over town by morning. We'll never hear the end of it. I got a can of gas in the truck back at Keller's station. Be a lot faster if we cut over that mesa. Get in just before sun up. -We could get lost. -Nah. See how bright the moon is? Come on. Wait, y'all. We don't know what's out there. -Yeah we do, a bunch of nothing. -Come on. Sure. What could happen? Hey, Keller, how's your grandpa gonna get along without you? I don't know. You talk to him about it? You know you can't sit down and have a straight talk with him. The man's goofy. Somebody's gotta look after him. Well, he always knew I planned on leaving. What are you getting at? Sometimes a guy's got his family to think about. Yeah, sometimes a guy's got his friends to think about, too, especially when there's a solemn vow involved. Let me get this straight... the universe is chaos, right? And now, billions and billions of years later, it works out to the point where me and my father the drunk live in a trailer on the outskirts of Dancer, Texas. So what's your point? Well, I don't have a point. There is no point. That's my point. Is your father still pretty bad off? And with you gone he's liable to get worse. I know. There ain't nothing more I can do for the man. Sure is pretty country. Wouldn't mind owning a ranch out here. You already have a ranch, the family ranch. Nah, it's my dad's, his and the bank's. Doesn't he want you to stay on? Gradually kind of take it over? Brought it up a couple of times and he told me how when he was my age he worked as a ranch hand and how nobody ever gave him anything. What? Aw, parents. The ones who should want you to stay on, don't, and the ones that do, well... Your mom still giving you a hard time about going to work for your dad? Yeah. But you told her you're going with us. Terrell Lee? Keller you met my mother. Nobody tells her anything. Damn it! You been hitting around this all night! You trying to back out of going with us? Is that what you're saying? Shh, quiet. What is it? Get over here. Get down. Ah, shoot. It's just horses. Wild mustangs. Wow. So close to town. (NEIGHING) I'm not coming with you guys. We can't stay. It'll ruin everything. I got no choice, Keller. What about the solemn vow we made to each other, huh? Stick together. What about our plans? We were 11! Things change when you get older. Oh, come on. All we've done growing up is talk about leaving. Hell, we bought our bus tickets two years ago! When we were younger I used to think it would be exciting to go someplace. Getting out of here... hell, there wasn't much else to talk about! No, you were more excited about leaving than any of us. When you get older you realize a person's got ties to a place. Have you guys even thought about leaving? What it all means? Really thought about it? -Sure, I've thought about it. -Yeah, it's scary. -You know how many people are out there? -13 million. 13 million! We come from a place with 81. -That's including the four of us. -I've researched everything! We've never been there, Keller. We got no idea what to expect. The four of us against 13 million strangers. You got all these ideas and dreams about us finding jobs, getting an apartment, and leading these great lives. You think you got it all worked out on paper! People's lives don't work out that way. -You're just being selfish ruining all our plans. -Your plans. -No our plans. -Your plans! It's our lives. We gotta make the decision for ourselves. Y'all don't listen to him. -Keller... -What? What, you're gonna tell me you two are having second thoughts, too? I don't know... I never thought I'd graduate. Didn't think past that, Keller. Maybe Terrell Lee's got a point. Maybe we haven't really thought about it like we should. I can't believe you're doing this. You're ruining it for everybody. You're a traitor. Y'all go ahead and think about it. Think about what it'd be like to stay here trapped in your miserable lives, just like him. Think about it. -Keller! -Leave me alone. He took it well. Better than I expected. You knew I was gonna stay? I met your mother. (LAUGHING) Shut up, Squirrel. No sign of the old man, huh? He'll be back when he runs out of money. You okay? You need help with your route? -Nah. -See you later! Grandpa. Grandpa. -Oh, hi Keller. -Hey, Sandra. This used to be Vivian's room. Still is. We got cousins in from out of town. How y'all doing? (GIGGLING) Vivian's sleeping on the couch in the den. Vivian! Thank you. Howdy, Keller. What's bothering you? I could just kill Terrell Lee. Keller, if they want to stay... I mean, it's up to them. Yeah, but if they don't go, I can't go. I can't make it out there by myself. I'd have to stay here. Oh... -Is that so bad? -Come on, Viv. How could anybody want to spend their whole life in a small town like this? Well, people do. Some folks even like it. Keller... since we were little you thought of nothing but reasons to leave. Did you ever once think about reasons to stay? 'Cause there are, reasons to stay I mean. And I think you oughtta look at those, too. And maybe you'll still find that for you there are more reasons to leave than to stay, but I just think you and the other guys oughtta give Dancer, and everybody in it, a chance. I gotta go in and help with breakfast. You wanna eat with us? No. Okay. You know maybe one of these times when we go for a walk, we can talk about me and what's on my mind. Sure. -What time you get in last night? -Never you mind. John? Can I go with you? Could be our last time riding together. Okay, but I don't have to wait on you. (SNORING) Terrell Lee? Oh, you look tired, honey. Come on, lean forward, let me fix your tie. Come here. Did you talk to your friends last night? Did you tell them you're gonna stay here and work with your daddy? Yeah. Terrell Lee, I'm gonna go check some rigs this afternoon. You want to go along for company? The other guys are leaving in the morning. I need to spend some time with them. Keller's not even speaking to me. You should go with your father, honey, get the feel of things. You'll be so much further ahead when you go to work first thing in the morning. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna be at the bus stop seeing my friends off. Honey! You cannot be late to work on your first day. -Now you're just gonna... -It's okay. You go see your friends off. See what an advantage it is having your boss be your father? Morning. Any aspirin? What time is graduation? It was yesterday. I thought it was today, Saturday. Today is Sunday. Damn, must have lost a day there somewheres. Well, I hope I had a good time, anyways. You did. What? What did you hear? -Who is that in the bedroom? -Huh? Oh, her. Met her in a waffle house in Fort Worth. Oh. It's good to see that your job hunting ain't interfering with the really important things in life, like picking up strange women. Sorry about your graduation. -Where you going? -Church. (CHURCH BELLS) -Church? -Yeah, church, the white building in town with the pointed roof and the cross on top. I didn't think you ever... I'll see you when you get back. (CHURCH BELLS) No... I... I'm hailing Mary and I'm begging you, Reverend. Please, please, I just wanna... Okay Squirrel. Go right ahead. (ORGAN PLAYING) Squirrel: Ouch! (LAUGHING) Please stand. (CHOIR SINGING HYMNS) Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we give thanks for all your countless blessings... Son, you all right? ...grant us forgiveness. Howdy, Earl. -Howdy. -You here on a Sunday? Well now, Keller, you know the store can't be open on a Sunday. Church-going women in town just wouldn't stand for it. The ranchers work seven days a week, livestock eats seven days a week. Ranchers all know I come down here on Sundays just to clean up. I'm not open, mind you. If they want anything, I'll sell it to them. Then, when all the good ladies in town are in church, I sneak off. Everybody is in church. Now is your chance to make a clean getaway. Well... I'll risk it. This being your last day in town, and all. Yeah, maybe. Earl, you been here all your life, huh? Yep. Well, except for a couple years in France. France? What were you doing in France? Folks over there we were having a world war. I got invited. You were in World War II? General Patton's army, all through France. -What was it like? -France? Well, I could tell it was, well had been, a pretty little country. But by the time we chased the Germans off of it, it was all beaten to hell. I think about going back. They probably got it all fixed up by now. I'd kind of like to see it again. Dancer must've been pretty dull, huh? I mean, after all that excitement. Nope. Before I went over there I was probably a lot like you, I guess, full of beans, wanting to see everything, do everything. But by the time they got through with me over there in General Patton's army, I just wanted to find myself a nice little out-of-the-way corner of the world, get myself a nice comfortable chair, and just sit. (CHOIR SINGING) Squirrel... Whaaa! Today's sermon is on lust. (LAUGHING OUT LOUD) -We're confronted with a... -Hush! ...every day of our life. Turn on the television and there it meets you, flip through the pages of the average woman's magazine... Shh! ...you'll find the threat of lust in an innocent advertisement. Go to the beach for a family vacation... Hush up! ...you will be once more faced with the latent power of lust and its deceptive lair. Today... That Los Angeles ain't this pretty. Not by half. I guess I oughtta go out there and find out for sure. You don't really want to go. You just don't want to have to do all the chores by yourself. Good morning. Squirrel, give me the robe. Wait! Wait! Jean! Hey Jean! GIRL: Bye-bye. -Hi, Loretta. -Hi, Squirrel. Listen, don't be depressed about choir today, you being so terrible and all. First time is always bad. -Loretta, we're leaving. -Okay. You won't be quite so terrible next week. You'll see. Squirrel, you old ladies man. -You were looking real good there. -No. No, really. I think she's coming around. Wasn't she saying something to you about next week? She says, "You won't be so terrible next week." See! She's really looking forward to seeing you again. I don't think so. Besides, I'm leaving town tomorrow. Then you gotta make your move now. You go on over to her house this afternoon and you call on her. No way, uh-uh. Aw, come on, Squirrel. What's the worst that can happen? You make a fool of yourself, right? You're leaving town anyway. I guess. And what's the best that can happen? Huh? Oh, that! -Well there you go! Go for it! -I will, Terrell Lee! -Alright! -Thank you very much! Your mama's ready to go. Okay. Hey, what's Rusty up to? Ask me later. Hey, Earl. I'll take a six-pack. Do you sell beer here? Well now, Keller, this being a dry county and all I can't legally sell beer. But I figure, driving 200 miles just to pick up a six-pack of beer, that's a little too far for anybody to go. You live in a town all your life and you think you know it. Thank you, Earl. So, Keller, still three of you going, so far? Yep. You know a lot can happen between now and tomorrow morning. I'm thinking chances are that one or two others might drop out. What are you planning on doing out there in California, Keller? We gonna get jobs, get an apartment. Well, Keller, I think what he's asking is what are you going to do with your life? I don't really know right off. I guess I'm hoping that when I get there I'll know when I see it. All I do know is that whatever "it" is, it ain't here. Well, good luck, Keller. I hope you find it. I think you will. I'm still looking for it myself. Keller, if you find it, give me a holler and let me know what the hell it is, okay? Okay. Oh hi, Squirrel. Just a minute. Daddy! What? Oh, howdy, Squirrel. Seems like you was just here collecting just a week or two ago. How much do I owe you? What? No... I... $4.75. Here's $5. See me next month. You forgot your... change. Terrell Lee! Now what kind of an impression is the boss's son gonna make wearing a t-shirt and jeans? Go in and change. Got suits in your closet you haven't even worn. Ready? You both could stand to dress up. You are inspecting oil fields, not working in them. Never know when you might have to get your hands dirty. Wait, wait! Terrell Lee! This was my daddy's hat. He wore it when he ran the company. Since you're named after him, I know he would want you to wear it. Thanks. Last night I heard Daddy talking to Mama, telling her how tough it's gonna be around here when you're gone. Really? He ain't said squat to me. Are you telling stories? No, really. He told her that he couldn't figure out how a natural-born rancher like you would wanna move to California. He said that? Every word, I swear. He said I'm a natural-born rancher, huh? He ain't said nothing to me about it one way or another. Well, he don't say much. No, he doesn't. -So Grandpa Terrell wore this out in the oil fields, huh? -Yep. Didn't help him. Huh? Rig chain... Damned near cut him in half. Didn't put a scratch on that hard hat though, did it? People say he was a real character. He was. He was one of the original wildcatters. I remember once he... walked us into a virgin field, put a handful of dirty in his mouth, chewed on it and said, "Drill here." Sure enough, we brought in a gusher. Really? Honest to God. Then I was going through some of his papers a few years ago, came across a geological survey on that field dated six months earlier. Oh, I sure got a kick out of that old man. I'd have done anything for him. Even marry Mama? Good lord, son, don't even think thoughts like that. Gets us both into a world of trouble. I got an uncle who lived in Midland. Only job he could get in Midland was driving a dump truck. He moved out there to California. Only job he could get was driving a dump truck. Now he's back in Midland. -Driving a dump truck? -Yup. I got cousins living in San Angelo. Their neighbors had a daughter moved out to Los Angeles a few years ago. She ended up joining one of them cults. Somebody saw her not long ago, bald headed, big old bull ring in her noise, handing out flowers at the Los Angeles International Airport. It's a true story. Keller, you best steer clear of them damned cults, you hear? Yes, sir. I'd be scared of them earthquakes. They seem to have them about every other day, with fires, floods, and riots in between. Will y'all quit trying to discourage Keller. It ain't fair. Y'all are trying to influence the outcome. Outcome? It's a brave thing Keller's doing, saying goodbye to his friends and family, moving out to one of the biggest cities on earth, where he doesn't know a soul, hasn't got a job, doesn't know what he's going to be doing. Y'all oughtta be more supportive. Yeah, thanks for the talk. Y'all made me feel a lot better about it, and I appreciate it. -See you later, Keller. -Yep. Well fellers, odds on none of them going just dropped to even. (MUTTERING AND TALKING) You could go to school over there at Sul Ross and still live here. You should talk to Daddy about that. I brought up college a few years ago. He told me all a father owes his son is room and board for 18 years and after that, he's on his own. L.A.'s so far off! I hear they got a real good meat science program down at Sul Ross. -Probably world famous. -Meat science? I don't know. Something like that. So, it wasn't you who sent away for that Sul Ross catalog back at the house? Uh-uh. Huh. Guess Daddy must have sent off for it. Where'd you see this catalog? Well... a while back it was on the bookcase, then somehow it made its way to the coffee table, then it was on the kitchen counter. It was there till yesterday. -I never saw it. -Well it was on your dresser this morning. Wonder how it got there. -'Cause you put it there. -No! -Uh-uh. -Josie? Fine. I put it on your dresser, but only your dresser. Just 'cause your so blind you haven't seen it lying all over the house. So you figure the old man left it lying around for me to find? Why didn't he just say something? He don't say much. What he does say, maybe you're not hearing. Howdy. You must be Squirrel. I'm Sue Ann. I'm... (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) I know. I did the best I could. Looks really good. I don't know how the two of you live in this trailer at an angle like this. He was drunk when he parked it. Never got around to leveling it. Well, I guess y'all haven't been here long. 12 years. Oh. He wouldn't do it anyway, level the trailer. Be like putting down roots or something. Nice to meet you. Oh, you know, your father's still sleeping. He, um... He was up earlier looking for the truck keys. Probably wanted to buy liquor. No, he wanted to take me to the bus stop. Listen, you hungry? Can I fix you something to eat? Yeah, sure. I could eat something. Good! Then we can talk and get to know each other better. -Miss Caldwell, let me get that for you. Thank you, Keller. I fixed you and your grandpa this tuna-fish casserole, the kind with the potato chips crumbled up on top. Oh, yes, m'am. Real nice of you. About California... Did I tell you about my nephew? For two years he lived just down the street from Charles Manson. Yes, ma'am. You told me. A word to the wise. Yes, ma'am. Close the door! A fly got in. Howdy, Miss Hufheinz, Miss Garcia. Keller, I brought you and your grandfather a taco salad. I made another jello mold, the kind y'all liked so much, lime with marshmallows and bananas and pecans. Y'all really shouldn't go to so much trouble. It's no trouble. Oh, it's a blessing to have someone to cook for. Got him! Arlen, that table's covered with dead flies. -I'll clean it. -Ida, sit down! Leave those fly bodies be. Lets the others know what's in store for them. (LADIES LAUGHING) I'm going to put this food away and I'll bring your dishes from last Sunday. Grandpa, who brought all these other dishes? -More widow ladies. -I know that. I mean who brought what? Damn it, Grandpa! All I ask is that you put the little labels on. How else am I supposed to get the right dish back to the right lady? Mrs. Brickmeyer makes the beet salad... Grandpa, you haven't even touched Miss Hufheinz's Jello mold from last week. Will you please say something to these ladies? It ain't my fault that I'm the only old man in town that ain't dead. Grandpa, you got a few minutes? Can we talk? I've got company. Where's Terrell Lee? Lord, what's happened? He's in back. We just had some trouble capping a well. Terrell Lee? Honey, is that you? Are you all right? He's all right. He's just upset. Come on out, son. (MOTHER LAUGHING) Come on out of the truck, and try not to touch anything. I got a big scrub brush in the house and I guess I better go get it. So, son, how you liking the oil business so far? (COUGHING) You know, I been seeing your daddy a while. I liked him the minute I laid eyes on him. Women do. I'm sure he does spend a lot of time drinking and running around, but I think he's a good man. Or he could be with some help. It's been tried. By your mother? She got tired of trying. She left. Well, he needs somebody, to take care of him. -Not that you don't do that. -Listen lady... You seem like a real nice person. Don't waste your time. Find yourself a nice guy. I've looked. SQUIRREL'S DAD: Damn it! There he is. Where the hell are those keys? Look in the truck. Beats me why women fall for some men instead of others. I bet you got a lot of girlfriends, huh? Yeah, right. Well, I bet pretty soon some girl's gonna come along, see how nice you are, and chase after you till you marry her. No, ma'am. It don't work like that. See... women don't chase after nice guys. They chase after guys like him and try to turn them into nice guys. It doesn't work. Well, he needs me. Maybe that's part of it: feeling needed, wanting to take care of somebody. I don't know. You know him. Maybe if you helped, the two of us can... I'm leaving town tomorrow. You are? You're just going to leave him? What do you think is gonna happen to him? Look, I know he's a handful. But maybe if you helped, both of us can handle him. You don't stand much of a chance. Any minute now, he's gonna find his truck keys and take you to the bus stop. (LAUGHING) All right, maybe you stand a little chance. I think it's gonna work out real good. I can tell already. You and your daddy just get used to some decent cooking and a clean house... Listen, lady, I didn't say I was staying. Well, it's gonna be a lot different around here. Just give me a chance. You'll see. You want dessert? I made pie. Pie? Who knows, maybe if we put our heads together we can do something about this girl problem of yours. This is good pie. WOMAN: Josie, come to supper. Sorry! This college catalog is just so interesting I just clean forgot about eating. Go put that away. I never knew meat science was so interesting. I mean, look at all these courses in here. "Horseshoeing and Horsemanship, "Blacksmithing I, Blacksmithing II, Advanced Blacksmithing..." Really? Oh, oh, here's a good one. "Meat Manual and Carcass Evaluation, "course content will include slaughtering and cutting carcasses "of cattle, sheep, and hogs." -Josie. -How 'bout Sausage Manufacturing? "The manufacturing of processed meats, "Product formulation, curing, smoking, sanitation and quality control. "Offered Spring only." Josie, eat your dinner. I moved the small herd down south over a few sections. They were about due. Good. "Livestock Slaughter Inspection, "regulations pertaining to livestock slaughter for human consumption." Josie, try and eat dinner. This meat here, was it one of our cattle? Sure, you remember Buster. Buster? -We're eating Buster? -Now, Josie, at least eat your vegetables. I'm turning vegetarian, I swear. These carrots don't have names. Let me see that catalog. They teach plenty of things besides meat science. Here is one of my favorites. "Life Drawing, -"through the use of live nude models..." -Josie. There's a lot of good courses in this book. You thinking about going? Well there's tuition, and room and board, and all that. Well, like I told you, it wouldn't be right for me to just give it to you. A man of 18 needs to be on his own not living off his parents. Yes, sir. You're a good hand around the ranch. Wouldn't think it'd be hard for you to get work. I'd got to Sul Ross part time. But I guess you're still thinking about going to California. After you've gone off, I thought I might hire a man to help out around here a bit. Maybe rent out your room to somebody. You interested? I thought I might offer you the job first seeing as how I know you can do the work, and you're already moved into that room. Kind of kill two birds with one stone, you know. -Well, gosh, I... -Well, you think on it. Last sunset together. Y'all missed it. Sorry. Yeah, sorry, kind of had things to do. I guess this is our last night together. I mean, all four of us. We've been hanging out for as long as I can remember. -A long time. -Yeah. I would've gone crazy in this town if it wasn't for y'all. -I really would have. -Yeah, me too. Of course, there were plenty of times when I thought if anything was gonna drive me crazy, it was going to be you three. -Us? -It was vice versa. Saying I do things to drive y'all crazy? You kind of run our lives, Keller. Someone has to take care of things, keep you all in line. (LAUGHING) You know what bothers me? -We know, Squirrel. -Don't start it, Squirrel. We talked about that. It's different. It's not that. It's my nickname, Squirrel. Y'all are my best friends, right? Been hanging out our whole lives, the four of us. I'd just once like to hear you call me by my real name. Just once. Okay, we give up. What is your real name? No. -You know something I think about? -There he goes again. I wonder what I'd be like if we grew up in a normal-sized town. I wonder if we'd all be such good friends. Yeah. Wonder if we'd even hang out together. It's not like we got a whole lot in common. We might have more friends, we just probably wouldn't be as close to them. I probably wouldn't have any friends. I'm sure you would. No you wouldn't. (EVERYONE LAUGHING) I wonder if... I wonder if there's things we missed out on growing up in a town this small. Life kind of things. I wonder if maybe we're behind other kids our age. Maybe we got the things they missed out on. You know, the things we take for granted. Maybe so. Guess we'll find out soon enough. Those of us who are going. Keller, doesn't look like I'm gonna be going with you. What? Me neither. Both of you are staying here? I got a good job offer, working with my father. I got a job working on my father. There's this woman my dad brought home, Sue Ann. She's okay. Good for you, Squirrel. Damn it, Terrell Lee, this is all your fault! -Keller... -No, we had plans, for years. Now one day it's all fallen apart? Come on, y'all, please! Keller, you can still go by yourself. All by myself, John? Come on, are you kidding? Come on, y'all. Don't do this to me! -Keller, look... -No! We had a deal. We promised to stick together! We made a solemn vow and y'all broke it. Well, I gotta head home. Yeah me, too. I'll see you off at the bus stop tomorrow morning, Keller. I can't go by myself. Sure you can. You're up late. Come in here a minute. There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. Terrell Lee... things are tough right now in the Texas oil and gas business. Yes, sir, I know. A lot of companies gone belly-up. I guess we're doing okay. Everybody is hurting. Your... mama wants you to take a management position, stand around and wear a white shirt. Hell, I don't even wear a white shirt. Well I did go oughtta here with one sometimes to please her, but I... keep a set of work clothes in the truck. Usually I'm out working on the rigs because... I can't afford to pay everybody I need. What can I do? Well, right now the only place you'd be of any real help is as an apprentice roughnecker. It's a good place to learn the business. But unless you got a real hard-on to be in the oil and gas business, it's not a career I'd recommend to anybody nowadays. But it's the family business, right? I mean... Won't I have to, like, run it someday? The business will be yours to run if there's anything there. Come over here. I want to show you something. This is what it's worth right now. That's nearly three-quarters of a million dollars. Son, in bookkeeping, parentheses around a number means it's a negative number. We're three-quarters of a million dollars in debt? It was even worst last year. Three-quarters of a million dollars? Folks say things are slowly gonna get better. If and when they do, you're welcome to stand around oil fields and wear a white shirt all you like. But you don't have to. After your mama and I are gone, if you don't want to run the company, don't run the company. There are a lot of folks out there who can. Hire one or sell the damn thing. Whatever you want. It's up to you. I hear now John and Squirrel are staying. Word sure travels fast around here. My dad will be happy. He has 20 dollars that just one of y'all will leave. -Nah, don't be so sure. -Huh? Lately I've looked at staying like you said, and you're right. There are a lot of really nice things about this town. Things I didn't notice till I was fixing to leave. And what with the others staying now, it looks like I got no choice but to... but to stay here in Dancer. And I thought... you and I was getting along real well and we talk to each other real good. So I thought maybe you and me could think about maybe... getting a... engaged or married, or something. What? -I've know you ever since I can remember, Keller. -Yeah. Marrying you would be like marrying my brother. (LAUGHING) You used to talk about us getting married all the time. We were 12, 13! And all you talked about was leaving town, about how you don't belong in a small town, how you don't understand why anybody would want to live in a small town. Well... I do. Well if you don't marry me, who are you gonna marry, Squirrel? (VIVIAN LAUGHING) You gonna be Mrs. Squirrel? I'm gonna go to Sul Ross next year, take some classes and meet people. 1,800 people go to school there and 6,000 in the town. 6,000 people. Can you imagine all those people? L.A. has got 13 million. Whoa. 6,000 is more people than somebody could ever meet, much less get to know. So, seems to me that 6,000 is bigger than any town needs to be. 13 million? I just don't see the point. Anyway, I'm gonna work on a teaching certificate and while I'm there, around all those people, I'll probably meet some guy I like, who is from another small town. We'll get married and move to his small town, or my small town, or some other small town. That sounds nice. For me... not for you. (GLASS BREAKING) Damn! What the... -Keller! -Sorry, I was uh... I was cleaning up and I dropped the pitcher. -That is my favorite pitcher. -Sorry... We gotta talk. Oh, well hell. All right, have... There's a fly in here. Damn it! Listen to me. I've been thinking I should stick around for a while. I mean, you're not getting any younger. You're just looking for excuses, Keller. Don't be a chicken shit. Grandpa, you need me to take care of you. Horse hockey. I got ten widow ladies just aching for you to get out of here so they can take good care of me. I ain't gonna let you spoil it by staying. -Grandpa... -Don't Grandpa me! I put up with you for 12 years, since your folks died. With you out of here I can finally cut loose. I love you, Keller. Now goodbye. All right. Then maybe you and me should have a talk about the birds and the bees. What do you need to know? Not me, you! You know it's a lot different out there nowadays. Do you know what people mean when they say safe sex? Keller, at my age there ain't no such thing. I could keel over right in the middle of it. At my age, you don't worry about catching something, you worry about finishing up in one piece. I'm gonna miss you, Grandpa. Your leaving in the morning. Go to bed. Well you should go, too. There's flies out here that you let in. They need killing. Did I call it or did I call it? It ain't settled yet. Here he is. -I'd say that pretty much settles it. -I think that's about it. -Earl, you owe me 30. -Yeah, you got it. Bobby, I need 20 from you. Take it easy, Seth. -Good luck, Keller. -Thank you, sir. -Bye. You take care now. -See you. -See y'all. -Let us know how the women are out there. -Tell us how the beer is out there. -Good luck out there, Keller. -Good luck, son. -Thanks, Earl. -Take care, Keller. -All right, Flora. -Bye, Keller. -See you, Jean, Loretta. With 13 million people out there, you're bound to find yourself a real nice girl. Think so? I'm going to miss you. I'll miss you too. -Bye, Josie. -Bye. Mills. Squirrel? Looks good. Oh, yeah, um... I got your old job at the gas station. I start today. No more paper route. Good for you, Squirrel. And listen, y'all, about last night... I was really upset. I didn't mean the things I said. -It's okay. -Yeah. I knew I had to leave town and I didn't want to leave you guys. -You tell Terrell Lee, okay? -Okay. When I get out to L.A. I'm gonna do all the things we talked about. I'm gonna write you and I'm gonna really rub it in. You'll make new friends out there, Keller. Won't be the same. Guess it won't. Hey guys, the bus is coming! Take care of yourself. Take it easy, Keller. Anybody seen Terrell Lee? (HORN HONKING) -Here he comes! -I see Terrell Lee! Changed my mind. Need some company? What about you taking over the family business? My dad and I talked. We decided I explore other career options. How did your mom take the news? She says she'll never speak to me and my dad again and then my dad said he's looking forward to the peace and quiet, so she started yelling again. She'll be fine. Well... Take care of him, all right? (LAUGHING) -I'll miss you guys. -Miss you, too. -Get out of here before your mama shows up. -Don't count on it. Hey, Squirrel! A going away present for you. Oh, no, Terrell Lee. Your car? Hot damn! Thank you! -You know what I just realized? -What? Now there's three of them and only two of us. Yeah, how 'bout that? -Things in Dancer are definitely looking up. -Definitely. I forgot my budgets. What are we gonna do? We'll be fine. Dear Mr. Rand McNally, here's why you should put out town, Dancer, Texas, on your maps. There's 81... 79 people who live there. They're good people, every one, as fine as people you'll find anywhere. That seems like the best reason there is to put any town on a map. Sincerely, Keller Coleman.
