Let me tell you something. Don't you try and run. It won't be good for you. You're beautiful. Really? You're beautiful. Fuck. Oh fuck. My aunt used to take me into town when she'd go buy food for the week. She's... she's always clutching a purse in one hand, mine in the other. She's as good as it gets. One morning... instead of walking our normal route into town, she took me a different way. We started to walk down this small little gravel backstreet, and I started to hear these noises and, heh, and I looked up and I said, "What's that?" and she said, "Chickens." I was five years old when my aunt took me with her and taught me how to... how to pick out a chicken for the first time. If they look tired in the eyes, pass." Where is she now? She died when I was 16. So what about your wife? What about her? - She's crazy. - Yeah. Aren't we all? You know, you could leave here if you want to... with me. I like it here. 'Cause I don't belong in a crowded world. I get that. I know you do. Let me tell you something. If you ever meet a loner, I, uh... I don't care what they say, it's not because they like to be alone. It's 'cause they already tried to fit into the world, and something went wrong. So let me ask you... when does your race end? I don't have a race. When does yours end? When I win. Where have you been hiding? Been working. Don't fucking start. Get your ass over here! I'm sorry. It's not what you asked, it's how you asked it. Stop it! Do not ever speak to me the way you just spoke to me. Is that understood? I don't care if you can help it. You try and find a way. I don't want to do this anymore. Your energy's so intense... but so soothing at the same time. And your hands... they are like magic. I love you. You're so important to me. I don't tell you that enough, but I should. I don't know why. You don't need to know. Just go with it, like water. Hmm. Where'd you hear that? - Come here! - No. Where is he? In the back, with the chickens. Come. I was gonna do those. Well, now you don't have to. I'm not gonna be crippled forever, you know. Whoa, it's getting hot in here. I'm hungry. You just ate. That doesn't count. Well, you're gonna have to wait. I've got a big dinner planned tonight, and I wouldn't want you to spoil your appetite. Get out of my kitchen! Now! Both of you! - Just stop it. - Are you gonna bash my brains in? No. No! Harder. Harder. No! What you gonna do? You gonna fuck me? Oh. Not so fast. - Come with me. - I can't leave. You could if you wanted to. Fuck you! You're only halfway there. I'll show you the way out. You better come if you wanna live. Wait! Wait! Hold on! Stay low. I need to catch my breath. You okay? I just need a minute. I need to get out of here. That's the way out. Follow the beaten path all the way up. Go. Get out of here. I never said to you thank you... for saving my life. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry. You should see your face. (laughs) - Let's go. Let's go. - I can't go. Yeah. You can. You deserve to be out in the world. You think you know what I deserve? You can't be in a place like this. You don't know nothin' about nothin'. You need to go, okay? I love my unknown place. It feeds me. I crave it. You can't be here. What's the chances she actually shoots me, huh? She shot our father. You're both full of shit. You're both full of shit. I win! I want the next one. Subtitles by explosiveskull
