Mad Wednesday! Radio Nantes. Radio Nantes. - Are you off to Garennes school? - Yes. - Pick up the boss's daughter. - Shall I handcuff her? - Sir? - Yes? - Can you come in for a second? - Who's that? The secondhand goods dealer and his son. - Is it bad? - No, that's just it. I'll be in in a second. Chief Inspector Pelloutier. Three French nouns are masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural: "amour", "delice" and "orgue". These exceptions are linguistic gems. They make us smile and they're harmless. - What's the point? - There is no point. There is no apparent point to lots of things. Latin, cross-stitch, old English and swing ploughs, until we realised Latin helps us understand computing and swing ploughs become vital when tractors run out of petrol. Learn about useless things. They'll be useful one day. Copy down these examples. - You too, Muriel. - But Dad, I know them all. - You've told me 100 times. - You do as the others do. I've told you that 100 times too. Victoria! - What? - Pass me the letter. - What letter? - By your feet, like. - What is it? - I've skived off music for months. They send letters home but I intercept them, like. Why do you keep saying "like"? Because where Bruno comes from "like" doesn't mean anything. It's used as punctuation. It's like a comma. You can go now. Spend your day off on exciting but useless activities. Botany, music, forest walks, and since at the start of this new millennium some parents aspire to making musketeers of their offspring, horse-riding and fencing. So, Grand-Pré, don't rehearsals start tomorrow? Tell me about it! I'm in such a state. Last night I dreamt I was conducting without any trousers on. I bet you looked sweet. If only it was just the trousers but I had no instruments either. How can you conduct an orchestra without instruments? What a nightmare! Thank goodness I woke up. I paint with my fingers unlike Delacroix I also sketch apples Cézanne, pass the rubber Soon my paintings will be ready to be hung I paint like Picasso with my fingers Wait, was that my cantata you were singing? Yes, sir, the brush cantata. - Brushstroke! - It sounds better as a rap. - Come on, Emma. - A cantata can't be a rap! Rap has a repetitive rhythm... - Where's Aunt Marie-Thérèse? - We haven't seen her. She's so untrustworthy. She makes us do stupid things and I get the blame. - Where can she be? - I'm not waiting. I'm off home. Go with her, Sarah. I'm sick of this! - Did you have a good day, sweetie? - Yes. Wait here while I pay for your school dinners. Wait, I promised Marylin I'd walk her home. This is becoming a habit. It must be love! When we move to Bordeaux next year I won't see her any more. - OK, but come straight home. - OK. - Promise? - Yes. Kiss? Victoria! Hi there. Haven't your girls come out yet? I'm waiting for my sister. - Nothing wrong, I hope? - No. - Although you never know with her. - Of course. - So, are you leaving, then? - Yes, I've finally decided. There are always one or two who leave. Forgive me. I'm in a real hurry. The canteen is about to close. My husband's the same. Always the same. Right. It has changes in rhythm and a melodic counterpoint. Rap, on the other hand... has no melody or harmony. It's always the same thing, always the same tempo. - Do you see? - Yes, sir. - See you tomorrow. - See you. He's defending his music. - Here. - Thanks. - You will come round tonight? - Yes, yes, yes. Dad, I'm sleeping at Colette's. Well, come home quietly. I want a lie-in. - Promise. - She does as she pleases. Look, it's harmless and it suits us. I'll be off. - Hi. - Hi. We can rest easy now till Thursday. Anything could happen between now and then. - Good evening. - How are you? - Fine. You? - I'm good. - Hi. - Hurry up, Mathilde. My nieces are waiting for me to pick them up from school. - Come on, let's go. - My bag. - Leave it. - I was abducted by a lunatic. The police are to blame for this. You're incorrigible. - Do you know what you stole? - Can I quench my thirst? This is unbelievable. You'll steal anything. Two packets of razors, blue cheese, three pairs of cotton socks, groundnut oil, a bottle of vermouth, three yoghurts, an Etch-a-Sketch... - What? - Etch-a-Sketch. - What the hell is that? - You don't even know. There's more: 1 kg of mangos, a fly trap and a cauliflower. That was for protection. - The cauliflower? - Yes. We've got better things to do. You've gone too far this time. Unless the charges are dropped, you'll go to prison. - Who's he? - He's the victim. He's a victim? - He's the hypermarket manager. - Then he's more of a profiteer. - Well, I didn't profit from you! - I should hope not. Tell her to stay away, Chief Inspector. I give the orders round here. Excuse me. - What did you buy for Antoine? - A fishing rod. - You know he goes river fishing? - Yes, of course. - No smoking. - It's my second. That's two too many. - Did you have a good day? - Yes. - Who are you phoning now? - Dad. - Can't you wait? - Mrs Pelloutier. Paolini, deal with Mr Tournier and Marie-Thérèse. I won't be long. Have a seat. - Time to confess, young lady. - The Brink's van holdup was me. But as for the sweet-shop robbery, I swear that wasn't me, Chief Inspector. My darling girl! Such a vivid imagination. I'm worried about you. Are you sure you're up to travelling to Bordeaux and back tomorrow? It's strange. Men seem to see pregnancy as an illness. I think you should ask your doctor. - Shall I call him? - You know very well that I have to attend the conference in Aquitaine at 11 am tomorrow. I don't get it. Why does a captain of the marines, who is about to give birth, have to attend a conference on fourth-generation landing craft that she's not even speaking at? Can you explain it? Don't try to understand the whims of a pregnant woman. Here are your uniforms. I was going to deliver them to you but sir never remembers the door code. 22 LEVLA. That should be easy for a policeman to remember. Unless I write codes down, I never remember them. We'll leave you to it. - Mathilde. - Come on, darling. I see you've been spoilt rotten. See you later. Only two kisses? - Thanks, Eliane. - You're welcome. Goodbye, Chief Inspector. Goodbye, Captain. - Will you see your father tomorrow? - Yes. It's ages since I last saw my father. But Mum promised me he'd write to me. What does your mum do? She's an accountant. She counts fish. Mine used to work in Singapore. She counted boats. That's me in my mum's arms in front of Raffles Hotel. What's Raffles Hotel? - It's a palace in Singapore. - Your mum's beautiful. She's beautiful but she's sad. That's why she hugs me so tight. I hug my parents tight too. It reassures me. Aren't you joining in the celebration? I like your wife. I think she's lovely. I regret what happened last year. Save your regrets for old age. Come on. Come on. What do I do with Marie-Thérèse? Put her in a cell to teach her a lesson and try to placate the hypermarket boss. - Let's drink a flute of champagne. - It's a glass not a flute. Is that right? Flute is the language of advertising not the police. OK, then, a glass of champagne. Quiet, please. Antoine, I am delighted to be raising my glass to you. Tomorrow you retire. You have been a courageous police officer. You may only have caught small fry so far, but we hope that, with this fishing rod, a gift from all your colleagues, that you'll finally land a big fish! The police always kowtows to mass retail. Of course it does. Thanks, boss. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's warm! Lukewarm. I hope that you will show this petty thief no leniency. - What he did wasn't serious. - He robbed his father! - It's not theft within families. - See? - Do you want a smack? - Hey! No brutality here. - Thank you, Chief Inspector. - See? He's fearless. You must lock him up to teach him a lesson. - It's not my job to scare children. - Pity. Raising children is the job of parents. What will he do later in life? Rob banks? - Of course not. - What makes you so sure? The saying goes: "Once a thief, always a thief." Believe me, in my experience petty thieves never become bank robbers. But my son is also a forger. He forges my handwriting to write sick notes. And what about you? Have you never been paid under the counter? Want me to check your accounts? Bruno! Bruno! - There you are! - Yeah. How did it go? Not great. That was a tough quarter of an hour, I'm telling you. You'll soon get over it. My father is a bastard. When my mum finds out I've been skiving off music, I'm in for a rough ride too. Do you think the sandbank has grown? The Loire is never where you expect it to be. Hey, boys! - What are you doing? - Going for a walk. - Do you come here often? - Yes. Are you coming over? No, it's too muddy. Last time I slipped and got mud all over my bum! What are you going to do, then? Watch the boats pass. - Where? - Guess. Come and find us! - Morons! - You're crazy! - Stupid idiots! - You scared us. - Cretins! - Hey, stay there. Wait for us! Why do you never take your boat out? I do so take it out. I do it on the quiet behind my parents' back. I don't sound the foghorn. Tons of girls have been on this boat. We took Solange and Bernadette out. Those silly cows? I hate them. They're stupid. Well, I thought they were nice. - They're not nice. - Anyway, you're lying! You never invited them on board. Not those two morons. Do you like them? So you don't like them? I've got a suggestion. Let's sleep on board tonight and leave at dawn tomorrow. Are you mad? What will my parents say? Just say you're staying at mine. - Do you think? - Yes. Are you staying? I don't know. My old man is already trying to have me thrown in jail. At the same time, I really want to stay. Then it will just be Bruno and me. All right, then. Pass me your mobile, Châtel. Please come. Hi, Mum. Can I sleep over at Muriel's tonight? No, there's no school tomorrow. We'll brush our teeth and be good, yes. All right. Thank you. Bye. Wednesday morning... - Save me a place at the table, OK? - OK, bye. More coffee? - I'd love one. - Yes, please. Place your bets. - Three twos. - Three tens. Three queens. - Max? - It's mine. - What? - Eight, nine, ten, jack. - Again? - Jammy bastard. - He's so jammy. - Luck of the draw. - Let someone else win! - What time is it? - 7:35 am. - I make it 7:40. I must go. You might make some back. Two more rounds and we stop. No, I have something important to do. - Something important, you? - Yes, me. Here's 1,002. Sub me the rest, Léon. Ciao, guys. Bye, Socoa. I'm not here, OK? It's my wife. You OK, Martin? Yes, fine. - You look dreadful. - What do you mean? As if you've been burning the candle at both ends. I'm meeting my daughter. What shall I do? Come with me. - Martin. - That's kind of you. - Is that better? - Yes. - Do you need these flowers? - No. - Can I take them? - Yes. What for? Something. What are you doing? You can't keep a man like me here by hiding the keys. You're so childish, Huguette. I don't understand why you need to get home. I want to be there when my daughter gets home. Can you come and open the gate, please? A man like you can manage without my help. A helping hand wouldn't go amiss. Easy does it. Thanks. Sometimes I think it's better to be thrown out than kept prisoner. Agénor Esposito. - Hello. - I teach at Garennes school. My daughter Victoria is at that school. - Victoria Socoa. - You're her father? I've only ever met her mother. She's a good pupil. - You're pleased with her? - Yes, but not with you. You can always tell when a pupil has an negligent father. You don't see her every Wednesday. Actually, I'm on my way to meet her now. Is that your car? Will you give me a lift? - I'm going to Gloriette - It will be a chance to scold you. What's so important in your life that it stops you from seeing your daughter once a week? - I do see her. - You never see her. Don't make me laugh. I've got a job. And you think teachers just twiddle their thumbs all day? He'll make me miss the train again. It's your father's speciality. - The first time was when we met. - What happened? I had found a good job in central Paris in a big hotel. A palace. The Ritz. I wanted to move cities. Life was good. I was happy. I was about to get on my train when your dad appeared and said: "Trains are pointless. They go nowhere." That line... I later found out he'd used it on other poor souls. Anyway, I didn't go to Paris. I never took my train. Then you came along, amore mio. - In the station? - No, a bit later. The second time was when I'd decided to leave him. He threw my case in the Loire. What, with all your things in it? More than that! My freedom too. Here's your sugar. The third time was after we separated. We'd made up on the phone. I was on the platform with my case. Do you know what he did? He put out a call for me over the station's PA. He told me some cock-and-bull story so I never went to join him. I wonder what he's got up his sleeve today. There he is! - Where? - There. Crossing the road. La macchina! The car? - I can explain. - Have you seen the time? It's six months since you saw your daughter and you show up late! Are you OK? Here, these are for you. See? I remembered your birthday. Don't try to mollify me. You take this and you take the cases. Come on, Victoria. - What's in here? - I'm taking our things to Bordeaux. I need to start making the move. - Just book a removal firm. - If you weren't up all night and you lived a healthier lifestyle, it would feel less heavy! Where's your car? Has it gone? Have you gambled it away? To think we only have one life and I had to end up with a guy like you. This is not what I booked. I've been put in a group carriage whereas I normally take an aisle seat facing backwards. There are lots of spare seats. You can pick any of them. I always have a reserved seat. It's too late to change it. Sorry. - In that case, I won't go. - As you wish. I'll file a complaint. - Right. - I'll complain! I have a long arm, you know. Yes, really. My mum said it was OK. So you'll come to the ad casting session? - Yes... we'll see. - I'm not sure... It's this way. A casting session for an advert? You never said. Isabelle was selected for a casting session. - She wants Mathilde to go too. -We want to be on TV. I hate advertisers, putting kids to work on their day off! - The kids enjoy it. - They play on kids' weaknesses. Look, it's not definite. And if we go, we'll take an afternoon train. - It's true... - I'm not happy about it. Stop being so superstitious! Planes, trains and boats all run to a timetable. - What could possibly happen? - I'm going to worry. That's what's going to happen. - Phone me as soon as you're back. - OK. Mum has been made a general of the French army. - It's... - Mathilde. - Don't exaggerate. - Such a vivid imagination! Run, Victoria! There's a free trolley. Can you lend me some money? There wasn't time to go to the bank. - You're so useless! - I can't spend the afternoon... All right, all right! Here you are. - Leave it to me! - We're late! Give it here. Sir, can we ask you a few questions? - What the hell? - It's a shortcut. - You what? - This way's quicker. God, you annoy me! What's wrong with you? Can I even trust you with Victoria? She gets hypoglycaemic, you know. - You do remember that? - Yes. Do you remember what to do if she has a fit? - Are you listening? - Yes! You lie her down, raise her legs and give her a sugar lump. - Can I trust you? - You know me. That's just it. It's best if we part here. Otherwise I sense... I'll never go. Darling. Remind Dad that it's Wednesday and that you have choir, piano and poetry. - All right? I love you. - It's time to go. Come on, Victoria. Wait. One more question. Have you ever been abroad? No. I am one of those people who has never left France. Take note, youngsters. - What are you doing? - I'm doing your lace up - It's not undone. - I know. I didn't want to argue with Mum. She's got a lot on her plate. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Chief Inspector. - Is everything OK with the flat? - It's great. But you made me take one that was too big. Still, my family is growing. We're expecting a baby boy. Congratulations. The Captain will be pleased. Personally, I'd rather have another daughter. Chief Inspector. - Everything all right? - Just a routine check. Don't worry. So, you've got your dad to yourself? - Daughters like that. - Fathers too! You don't often see your dad but you won't be disappointed. - Chief Inspector Pelloutier. - Martin. Hey, Chief Inspector! There's no such thing as a bitter pill. Carry on like that, and you'll end up in the clink. Let's not hang around here all day. The Chief Inspector's card wallet. Chief Inspector! Never mind. I'll hand it in later. - Wait. - What? - Sophie's birthday. - Same as Mum's? - Makes it easier to remember. - Right! Are you home, Sophie? - Hungry? - I've had breakfast. I remember Mum's breakfasts. I'll make you a proper breakfast and you can tell me your news. - Do you like scrambled eggs? - Dunno. How come? Has Mum never made them for you? - No. - Well, you're in for a treat! Right... bowl. Most importantly... fork. - Can I do it? - Yes, here. I'll change my shirt. Don't beat too hard. It's not an omelette. How long have you lived in this flat? About three weeks. We're still working on it. It's not finished. Right, here's the plan. I have some boring business to attend to. You stay here and watch TV or read and I'll come back and pick you up. We'll spend the afternoon together, OK? I'd rather be with you all day, but all right, then. Orange. - Orange? - It's my secret ingredient. You're here? Yes. - Hello, Sophie. - Hello, Victoria. - She's with you today? - Yes, I told you. Told me what? - That she was with me today. - No, you never said. I thought I had. Happy birthday. Can I have a word? I won't be long. I took your grey suit to the dry cleaner. The good one, I hope. Yes, the one which checks the pockets first. Why were you at the Mercure hotel in a room costing 850 francs? What? You didn't go to the Mercure hotel? What are you getting at, my love? Stop lying through your teeth. If you carry on lying to me, I'll smash the place up! It just slipped my mind but I remember now. I had a meeting at the Mercure hotel and afterwards I needed to sleep so I booked a room. You booked a room? Yes, sometimes my job is too much for me and I need to rest. Doctors say you should sleep when you're tired. You should give into fatigue and sleep. - You could have come back here. - True. But I can't rest when you're here. I need to be alone sometimes to recharge my batteries. I phoned the Mercure hotel. I told them I was Mrs Socoa and had left my sponge bag behind. - And? - They weren't surprised. They said: "No, it's not here. We would have let you know." What do they know? They see so many people. - Don't take me for a fool. - I'm not. On the contrary. Sophie! Let me explain. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Enough is enough. You're leaving. You can't do that to me, not today. It's hard enough with Victoria here. Just go! I'm due in court today to discuss Corinne's maintenance payments. - That's not my problem. Just go. - Can I just..? Get out of here. Sophie, let me ex... - Ow, that hurts. - Just go. Get out! I can't take any more. - Enjoying yourself? - Yes. Go before I throw it out. He's still here! Stop making a spectacle of yourself. Now, calm down. Do you know what? I'm glad your first wife is taking you to court. I'll suggest to Victoria's mum that she does the same. You're a bastard. A pathetic loser. A swine! I don't know what I ever saw in you. I'm grateful for the pain your exes inflict on you. If they have any more dirty tricks up their sleeve, I salute them. OK, you're right. Stop it. - Are you OK? - I made an omelette instead. Good decision. Dad. Martin. More! More! Olé! Get out or I'll chuck the lot out and call the police. All right, I'm going. Can I just explain... All right, all right. I'm going! I'm going. - Shall we have coffee elsewhere? - Better had. - Do you think it's wise? - Yes. Do you like it? Eh? Yes. - You hate it, don't you? - On the contrary, I love it. - Shall I show you what's in my bag? - If you like. So... a little bag, some lip balm... Shall I show you my other drawings? This one is of lovers kissing with all sorts of animals. This one is of lovers at a wedding with their heads in the cloud. This is a photo. It's my friend Marylin's mother. Pretty, isn't she? - She looks vacant. - You're a fine one to talk! I'm just a bit distracted, that's all. Your mum yelled at me earlier, Sophie threw me out... Today's a bad day to talk to me about women. But I'm happy with you. - We're good together, aren't we? - Yes. Why aren't we like everyone else? What do you mean? No one's like everyone else. Take him, for example. His wife gives him a hard time. She makes him get up early to look for her cat. Lots of people have cats to find. - Do you know him? - No, but... You can guess what people are like at a glance, you know. What about her? Her? That woman had a dwarf parrot from Brazil and she clipped its wings but one day it flew away and now she runs around with her daughters shouting: "Have you seen a dwarf parrot with clipped wings?" Nonsense! I know those girls. They're at my school. Their mother doesn't have a parrot. She's got a funny name: Vitalie. Vitalie Rambaud. You find that funny, do you? Like it or not, you're going to choir and then home. - Can I rely on you? - Will you come to the fashion show? I don't know. I'll try. Your aunt's in trouble again. What sort of trouble? Trouble. She brought us lots of stuff last time she came. You didn't keep it, did you? You can tell me later. I don't have time now. Let's go and sing. Wait for me. - Bruno! Hi. - Hi. - Put the door on the catch. - OK. Where did you learn to drive a boat? I've always driven this tub. It's easy, second nature. - Shall I teach you? - Yes. Stand still and look straight ahead. It's easy. It's like riding a bike. Stop. That was out of time. - Stop. - Let's do that again. Girls. Be serious, please. Music is only a distraction for the audience. For the performers it is about rigour and exactitude. Take your places. Let's do that again. We'll do that last part again. Stand up and sing the second part. Let's go before it rains. I'll just pack your stuff up. How would people describe us? As a dad telling his daughter life is full of good surprises. - Good ones. Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Where shall we start? - What do you want to do first? - Go to choir. - Why choir? - Because I have to go. - Where's choir? - That way. Well, let's go, then. Come on. What have you brought home, Dad? It stinks! How disgusting! Not again, Dad. You promised to stop bringing sheep home. I'm doing a favour for a friend. He had one too many. It's an opportunity for us. I'm not putting it in my bedroom. Tell him, Mum. - We'll put it in Said's room. - Why my room? Hello. This is Lucienne. My daughter, Victoria. - This is Alice. - Hello, Martin. Victoria, Thérèse. - Evelyne. - Hello, Martin. And this is Cécile. Cécile. My daughter, Victoria. Come with me. This is the boss, Nicole. She's strict but she likes a kiss. That's my manager, Mr Joris. My daughter. Will you look after her? I won't be long. - Good morning, sir. - I want a word with you. Tell me something, Socoa. I used your office earlier while my computer was being fixed. All the calls that came through were about your betting debts. Threatening calls, the same voice every time. Your home life is your business but our company is not a betting office. Don't let it happen again. - It won't. - I hope not. - A simple misunderstanding. - You're late so get down to work. - I'm afraid I can't just now. - What do you mean? I need the afternoon off to look after my daughter. I don't care if it's Wednesday. I want you to talk to Mercier. - Not Mercier! - Yes, Mercier. You have overstepped the mark this time. Tell me, in your opinion, is it normal for an estate agent to offer credit on a deposit? - Well? - No. You got us into this mess, now get us out of it. Either that or leave. See you next Wednesday. See you Wednesday. I'll be right back. Mr Mercier. Mr Socoa! - You know why I'm here? - I can guess. - Mercier... - You can't do this to me. My ex-wife has taken me to the cleaners. That's a familiar story but it's not my problem. You wanted to buy a flat. You paid a 300,000 franc deposit. You begged me to give you credit. I liked you so I trusted you. I wasn't a vulture. - Sure. - I'm sure you'll agree. Yes, yes, Mr Socoa. But as for the money for the flat, I don't have it any more. - Not exactly. - How do you mean? I mean, I have it and yet I don't have it. - Do you have it or don't you? - I don't. You promised the solicitor a cheque for 2 million francs. - So you had the money? - I made a bad business deal. - What sort of deal? - A deal. Involving an animal running round a racecourse? - I bet very rarely. - That means nothing. - It does. - No one bets rarely. You either bet or you don't. I know. I mean, I can guess. What's your thing? Card games? I play a bit of poker, but I'm very careful. How much have you lost? 600. 600? - 600,000? - You could say that. That's massive! You do realise that? - I sometimes win. - That's worse than losing. That's the trap. You're right. Winning is worse because you feel like a god and you make all sorts of rash decisions. Whereas losing is great. It changes everything. You become human again and stop. So I've decided to stop. You'll never stop, you deluded fool. Gamblers aren't bad guys. Some even love their kids. But they always put cards and horses first. There are three types of men: organised people who make long-term plans, ordinary folk who live day to day and then us... I mean, you, gamblers, who live hour to hour. That's why you'll never stop. What do we do about the deposit? It's your lucky day. I'll talk to my boss. I'll say I did my best but you're skint. But I'll need 10%. - 10%? You mean... - 30,000. - What if I pay cash? - 20,000? - 15? - All right. - It if helps. - It does. - Look! - What? - What are you looking at? - That boy. - He's all alone. - Is he? Yes. He'll fall in the river. - Hey, little boy! - Over here! Let's go and get him. We're coming. Don't worry. What's your name? - Augustin. - Nice name! - Where are your Mummy and Daddy? - On a plane. - A plane? - He's an abandoned child. - Have you been alone long? - Yes. - Where do you live? - I don't know. Someone must know where his parents are. Let's ask. Do you know this little boy? Again? I've given money already. - But do you know him? - Do you know this boy? He's lost. I recognise you. You too. Very funny, kids. Have fun. We've found this little boy. - I'm pressed for time. - But he's lost! My wife is lost too. He's definitely lost. - He's miles from home. - He's very unhappy at home. What now? I'm sure he doesn't want to go home. Let's adopt him and take him back to Mum. - Shall we? - Yes, why not? - Where are we going? - To fish for eels. - To fish for eels? - Yes, I've set the compass. With this stormy weather we should catch a few. There's nothing you can't do! - I'm a good kisser too. - You are? - Just ask Solange and Bernadette. - I bet I kiss better than them. Do you want me to show you? - Mind the step. - Do you want to play ball? Right. Mum! Right, I'm on my way. Your aunt's at the police station. - She is? - Yes, I'm going there now. Stay here. You'll find all you need in the fridge. But, Mum! I've got something to tell you. Not now. I don't have time. Don't forget the fashion show. - But Mum... - I don't have time! When you're lost, Augustin, you're really lost. Later we're all going to a fashion show. It must have been about nine. It's nearly midday and you've only just noticed! - What's his name? - Augustin. - How old is he? - Three, the day before yesterday. The day before yesterday? Are you sure? No, I mean the day after tomorrow. You don't leave a child that age unsupervised! - What's your financial situation? - We both work at the shipyard. So no ransom money, then. Augustin Gourvelec, three years old, blond hair, blue eyes. Here's his photo. Usual procedure. Start at the Gourvelecs' home, retrace the kid's steps and then spread out in circles. Paolini, map out the search area. I need firefighters and sewer workers. - Get to work. - OK. - Riviere, come with me. - It's hot work. I know it's hard, but... A child has gone missing? - No doubt snatched by a lunatic. - How awful! - Where's my sister? - In a cell. - Oh? - So she's at it again? I don't know what to do any more. I can't take care of everyone. - Where is she? - In the first cell. I'm so sorry. - I couldn't help myself. - I won't give you a lecture. But I'm meant to be at work. The kids are on their own. You could have resisted the urge for their sake. - When do I get out? - What? - When do I get out? - You're not getting out. The chief inspector hates the hypermarket manager too. I'm sure together we could nail him. You want your head tested. She wants her head tested. - Don't abandon me. - I won't, but I wish I could. Don't, Victoria. People sit on those... All right, then. Jump! - I've never seen you jog. - That's because I don't jog. Look at that guy. He looks as if he's having a stroke. - What about rollerblading? - I don't do that either. When I was your age I went roller-skating. Look at that poor guy. It's as if he was ice-skating without ice. Come on. I don't swim either. I hate chlorine and you get fungal infections. What would Mum say if you caught an infection? Have they nothing better to do? Don't they work on Wednesdays? All this swimming... jogging, running, rolling! - Your sugar! - It's OK, I'm fine. - I'm in the way, aren't I? - Of course not. It's just bad timing. I've got a lot on today. Look at them! - Are you OK? - I'm fine. Oh, Marylin! Where are you off to? To see my friend. Marylin! - Hello. - Hello. - Are you Marylin's friend? - Yes. Look, that's my dad back there. - Want to play? - Yes. - What? - The alphabet game. Victoria! I've got to go. Sorry. - Who's that? - Marylin and her mum. Is that the woman in the photo? Yes. - What are they doing here? - I don't know. Having a day out. - That's not a bad idea. - What's not a bad idea? Hello. I'm Martin Socoa, Victoria's dad. Hello. I'm Marylin's mum, Antonella Lorca. - What was that? - Antonella Lorca. - Hello. - Hello. I hope you don't mind my asking, but what are your plans today? Nothing special. I've got an appointment and I don't want to abandon Victoria. Do you mind looking after her for an hour or two? - Why not? - That's very kind of you. Thanks. Hello. Hello. I'm afraid it's not possible. Today's Wednesday and we've got lots to do. I'm sorry, but... Another day. Come on, Marylin. Your face is as changeable as the Nantes sky. No, it's not. So you do think she's beautiful? I'm not sure. - She seems to float through life. - Float? What do you usually do on Wednesdays? See my friends, go to the cinema. Where are your friends now? I told them I was spending the day with you. Because I have to go... I have to be somewhere and I don't want to drag you along. - The court? - Yes. How do you know that? I overheard you telling Sophie. It will be fun to see you in court. Socoa! You're late again. - You're incorrigible. - Is it over? No, it hasn't started. You're lucky. The prosecutor is late for once. But your luck stops there. You'll be convicted. You owe seven years of maintenance payments. The DPP can have you placed under a committal order. - What does that mean? - Prison. - I can't go down for that! - With immediate effect. - Immediate effect? - Here and now. But I've got my daughter. Her mother's away. Help me! - Is she the plaintiff? - No, my first wife is. She doesn't need my money. - Will they send you to prison? - No, don't worry. - Is this your daughter? - Yes. From my second marriage. Then we're in with a chance. Here's what we'll do. - I won't do it! - Why won't she do it? I'm not going to prison with him. I can't, anyway. I've got school tomorrow. Try to understand. No one's asking you to go to jail, just to say you want to. It's not the same. I'm not a liar like you. A defendant has every right to lie, my dear. They do? Isn't she a bit young to have that instilled in her? Where are we on the list? Jacquet versus Socoa, case number six. - Six. The devil's number. - No, that's 66. 24 (2+4),15(1+5), 33... The devil's number! - Well, there's no way round it. - I'm off. Victoria, stay here! You're unbelievable! You can tell who's bringing you up! Well, it's certainly not you! Take that! - Mum's never done that to me. - You're due in court. If you don't turn up, they'll send you down. Figure something out. It's your job. It's what I pay you for. - Six months' worth of unpaid fees! - So I owe you. - Indeed you do! - What's the problem? Lawyers are like tailors, the last to get paid. Wait! Victoria! Then, like a tailor, my defence will be made to measure. Keep an eye on her. It's all sorted. CID is sending back-up. Your wife is stopping off en route. - Denis! - Mrs Rambaud. My sister's crime is a trifle compared to this. I get it. You don't want your sister to go to jail. - Precisely. - Nor do we. But the hypermarket manager won't drop charges. He's livid. - I could try talking to him. - You do that. Thanks, Denis. We're in luck! Here. Nice one. Careful! - Let's put them in the sack. - Yes. Got it? There, that's better. That's it. Hurry! Wait here for us, Colette! Radio Nantes, the weather where you are. Is it a day for umbrellas? Yes, to be on the safe side. We're in for a typical Nantes day: changeable with sunny spells and scattered showers. You should never be without an umbrella in Nantes. My girl's back. - Ah, Mrs Vivien. - Mr Esposito. I'm not too early am I? No, I was just doing the ironing. I've done all my marking. I've come for Colette. Colette? Has she had breakfast? But I thought Muriel was staying over at yours. No. So Colette didn't sleep here last night? - The room's empty. - You're scaring me. I've been looking all over for you. I was worried. I know, I overreacted. You're right. I'm a liar. What's more, I hit you. I'll never forgive myself. - I'm sorry, all right? - I don't forgive you. - You have to forgive people. - No. What do you want me to do? Go down on bended knee? No, stop it. I forgive you. Should we go back in? - Do you want to? - You need me, don't you? Come on, then. - Take your sugar. - I'm fine. - Sure? - I'm sure. Don't you ever do that again. Socoa! Bad news? It's over. Thanks to her, your case is postponed until September. I won the judge round. "Your Honour, we go back a long way, you and I. "We have witnessed some courtroom dramas in our time. "We have a history, Bertrand." - You used his first name? - I didn't dare. Although we were at school together. I never saw him as a high flier. Still, back to me. I embellished my speech with a few well-chosen examples... - Dad! -...the cream of the crop. - Do people still say that? - Why, yes. I had the words of the great Pollak, my master, ringing in my ears. I said you were in dire straits. I implored the judge: "Grant him a deferment. Give him one last chance." - Good luck. - You're too good for this place. That was him. As I finished my speech, I saw tears in his eyes. I appealed to him as a family man. He has troubles of his own. His daughter ran away last night. I think I made the best case of my career. Well, goodbye, you poor wretches. Don't forget to pay my bill. I'll give you a reduction for the satisfaction you gave me. - What's wrong? - She fainted. - There's no need now. It's over. - For real! - Good Lord! - Can I help? No, it's OK. I'm used to it. Pass me some sugar from my bag. There. Here. - Unwrap it. - Right, unwrap it. Are you OK? The bell for the first Wednesday of the month. It's midday. - It has an alarming ring to it. - I quite agree. - Do you need any help? - No, I'm used to this. Thank you. Are you OK? Are you sure? - Will she be all right? - Yes, fine. Thank you. Are you all right? - Sweetheart... - Can I help? No, thank you. I'm fine. I'm used to it. Try to sit up. We'll go to a restaurant and refuel. Are you OK? - Can I do anything to help? - No, thanks. I'm used to it. Shall we try to stand up? Are you OK? Can you stand? - Do you need help? - No, I'm used to it. Victoria, come and eat your strawberries! Come on, hurry up. - Were you worried when I fainted? - Of course I was worried. - Did you ask for help? - No. Never ask for help in the courts. You never know who you'll find. - Were you worried when I ran away? - Very worried. Sugar? Yes, please. Can we have some sugar, please? How worried? A little, a lot? A lot. A real lot? - Yes. - It wasn't very nice of me. No, it wasn't. - Did you think you'd lost me? - Yes. - Did you look for me? - Yes. - Where did you look? - As far as the river bank. - That far? - Yes. Poor Dad. You must think I'm cruel. You're not cruel. - You're a kid. - Can't kids be cruel? No. What about when the Primary 5s stripped Colin naked and stuck chewing gum to his willy? - They did that? - Yes, in break time. That was unkind, but children aren't cruel. They hurt you but they're not cruel. Now, eat your strawberries. - Can I pinch one? - Yes. - Victoria! - What are you doing here? Having lunch out with Mummy. - Sorry about earlier. - Don't worry. - Can we go and look at the boat? - Yes. - Come straight back. - Yes. So we meet again. I like looking at your face. You look tired but I find it restful. Perhaps we could meet one day and have a chat. Antonella, when you got off the tram it felt like a wasted opportunity. Wasted opportunities lead to happy endings. There's something about you that makes me want to be truthful. I prefer lies. Lie to me. I don't want to run off with you. Where don't you want to run off to? Las Vegas, Monte-Carlo... off the top of my head. Macau? Saigon, Mandalay, Rangoon... Or those islands in the desert that disappear when you leave. Cities where you can dream and forget everything. Is something wrong? I must go. Marylin! Hurry up, poppet. - Can we invite Victoria back? - No. - Goodbye. - Bye. Do you know what I'd like? To live on a boat with you and tour all the rivers and canals. After that we'll leave France and go to Louisiana. We'll breed crocodiles and sell their skin. - You get crocodile farms out there. - But we'll get eaten! No, we won't. We'll tame our crocodiles. I don't want to leave. I like it here. - Ah, the smell of the turf! - What turf? It's another word for horseracing. It's the official term. - But this isn't a racecourse. - You can watch the meetings here. - What meetings? - The races. - Bourbon! - How's it going? - Any tips? - Definitely Harmony. Isfahan? He needs a stepladder to jump the hedges. He's a donkey. - There are donkeys? - A donkey is a slow horse. It's what we call a horse that lags behind the rest. - Let's have a punt, then. - He's a dead cert, I'm telling you. 2,000 on number four to win. - I need a word. -Eh? I need a word with you. - Hello, Socoa. - My daughter Victoria. Dan, Bourbon. - Dad? - What? - I need the loo. - It's right there. Come and hold the door for me. Right, look after this for me. Come on, let's go. - Did you bet on Harmony? - No. Socoa followed my tip. Go on! You're on the home strait! You'll come in last at this rate. Go on! He's doing well. Go on. That's it. Only 300 metres to go! - Go on. - You can do it. You can do better than that. Damn! I told you not to bet on number 4 in the first race! I stood to win ten grand there, Dan. If you don't bet, you can't lose. That jockey's on bad form! He's all I need! Victoria... quick, look. Do you see a fat guy in a brown coat? - No. - Look again. - Yes, I see him! - Is he coming over? No, he's watching TV. He's at the counter now. - Are you sure? - Yes, he's there. Martin. Grogneau says you owe him 30,000 francs. He asked me to bet a grand for him on Arsinoe in the Breeders' Cup. Some rat at 30 to 1. Arsinoe came in first. Only I put his grand on Rasputin. It was a hot tip. I was unlucky. Sounds like it. Watch him. He's not as harmless as he looks. He's not the type to give in without a fight. He'll make an official complaint. He loves doing that. If you get done for betting fraud you face a hefty fine. Perhaps even a jail sentence. - This is Agincourt. - What's that? It's like Berezina only during the 100 Years' War. - Mummy. - Yes? Coming. Mummy? Mummy! I've got no pink. That's pretty like that. Who is it? It's you and me. What am I doing? What's up with me? You're crying. That's very... Marylin, come here. Can you do Mummy a massive favour? Yes. I want you to go and see a man. He lives at 17, Rue du Roi-Albert. Rue du Roi-Albert. - Do you know it? - Yes. I want you to go to that man's house. - His name's Franck. - Franck. Second floor, on the left. Will you remember that? Second floor, on the left. Give him this. He'll give you something for me, OK? - Yes. - Don't lose the envelope. - No. - Go on. Hello. I've come to see Franck. That's my dad. What is it? Hello. Hello. My mum asked me to come. What's your mum's name? Antonella. OK, come in. And what's your name? - Marylin. - Marylin? - Like Marilyn Monroe? - No, like my grandma. Bastien, look after Marylin. I'll be right back. Do you like buying stamps from my dad? I don't know. - Do you want to play with me? - On your Game Boy? Here, Marylin. Take this. Give this to your mum, and no dawdling, OK? No sign of Augustin, just a little girl. - Check who he belongs to. - I said girl! If she's on her own, drive her home. Are you on your own? Yes. - Are you lost? - No. - Do you live far? - Quite far. Get in. We'll give you a lift. My mum told me not to accept lifts from strangers. Then we'll walk together. I'll make my own way back. Do you like music? It's not for me, it's for my mummy. Your mummy? Neapolitan songs. "See Naples and die." I've never understood why. I've never been. I've got a tip for the last race. It's a dead cert. It comes from the trainer. Absalom, Charlemagne's son. They've held him back so far, but they're releasing him. Bet the lot: your savings, your wife's jewellery. If you've got an oil well, bet that. Your kid's bike even. Bourbon... come and see. - Do you have a bike? - No. I've got a tip for the last race. A beauty. Let's go 50-50. 5,000 each on Absalom. Absalom... 50-50? What do you reckon? Fell, fell, fell. You're on your own with this one. - Hello, Patrick. - I'm here to study maths with Said. Come in. Said, it's for you. It's your friend, Patrick. - Hi. - Hi, there. - Shall we go to your room? - No. Let's go into the dining room. - What's that? - Our noisy neighbours. Get back to work. - What's that? - Never seen a sheep before? - Why have you got a sheep? - It's from my uncle's farm. He wants us to take it to the vet. It's ill. Really? It's ill? Augustin should train to be an engineer. Engineers are boring. He should be an adventurer. - What exams do you take for that? - I don't know. - Where's Augustin? - Haven't you seen him? He was with you! Augustin! - I'll look out in the street. - I'll come. Augustin! It won't happen again. We'll have her treated in a clinic. The families of thieves always say that. The treatment can't be effective. They all reoffend. - I promise to keep an eye on her. - All right. I'll let her off just this once but I don't want to see her again. Thank you! - Let me kiss you. - No! Thank you, on her behalf. This breaking news comes from the police station in Nantes. A three-year-old boy ran off earlier while in his parents' care. He is dressed in blue pyjamas... - Hello? - Emma, it's Mum. - How are things? - It's Sarah. - You sound funny. - No, everything's fine. What are you doing? Playing, dancing, having fun. Everything's fine. - Have you eaten? - Yes. Don't forget the fashion show. We won't forget. That's good, sweetie. I'm relying on you. Lots of love. OK. So he wasn't out in the street? Isn't it awful, that kid disappearing like that? I've had to leave a house full of kids on their own. They're sensible but I still worry. I'd never ever do that. Well, you only have one. No, I've got four. I've got three more there. Oh, right. That's nice. - Hello. Bye. - Bye. Let's put you in the boot! Augustin! This is all I have left. Socoa, where are my 30,000 francs? What's with the hand? I always make sure I stand at least a metre back. People move without thinking and a finger in the eye is painful. - Can I have my 30,000? - Of course, no problem. I need to pay my heating engineer. There are two types of people you shouldn't keep waiting: women and heating engineers. Then let's not keep him waiting any longer. I want the rest by tonight. - By tonight? - I can't sub you. Excuse me. Number five, 20 each way. - What? - Five, 20 each way. - So you didn't win? - No, I lost it all. Let's go. I'll settle up. How much do I owe? What's this? The chief inspector's card wallet. He dropped it at the station. The chief inspector's going to bet on the races. Come on. What time is the last race? In 20 minutes. Ready for your bath? Are you sad? Do you like Bruno? No because he likes you. - Do you want to go out with him? - Would you like that? If you like him more than I like him, I'd rather he went out with you. Thank you. That's nice of you. It's funny. Now you've said that, I like him less than before. Do you know what my dad says? That life is great because nothing is ever as bad as it seems. - What are you laughing at? - You. Why? We're not telling you. - Go on, be nice! - No. You have to be wary of musicians. They always make you sad. What do you think of Henry Châtel? - He's not bad. - I like him too. Hey, Henry Châtel! Come and dance with us. - Oh, he's blushing! - He's blushing! It's unusual for girls that age to disappear like that. What do you think? Colette needs to eat when she wakes up. She has a big appetite. - Less so recently, I'd say. - You're right. Ever since she became friends with Muriel. Mr Esposito, I'll be honest with you. Your daughter is a very bad influence on Colette. I don't believe in influences. You know what Pasteur said. Germs are nothing. It's the environment that counts. Pasteur... - What's Pasteur got to do with it? - Quite a lot, actually. Muriel does as she pleases. What I don't like is that your daughter forced mine to lie and be a hypocrite instead of fleeing openly. You're forgetting something. Kids don't want their parents' permission to run away. We must phone police. How much? 2,000 francs won't hurt. Do I want a receipt? No. Are we allowed to use the policeman's card? He's allowed to. I'm not really. There we go! Wait. Come here. Tell Dédé to bet on Absalom in race seven. Repeat. - Absalom in race seven. - Correct. And give him this. Very discreetly. He's a friend. You've got tons of friends, except Grogneau. - Grogneaus. - There are several? All ready to ambush you when life is sweet. - And when life is bad? - They attack. Really? They ruin your life. They talk about funerals at weddings and death when babies are born. They tell kids who steal they'll go to jail, ruin the present with talk of the future and predict rain for your holidays. They shoot you down in mid-flight, taking the wind out of your sails. They make you fill out a form when you talk of love. That's what a Grogneau is. Now, hurry! I'll wait outside. - Aren't you watching the race? - No need. It's a dead cert. When Dédé gives you a tip, you can nap and wake up to a windfall. For betting you need experience and intuition. You must keep your wits about you. If you ever bet, never rely on luck. - Remember that. - Yes, Dad. - Promise? - Yes! Go on, then. I'll wait outside. Come and find me. - 10 francs on Singapore. - Singapore? Here. Yes, Singapore. Thanks. - What are you staring at? - Sorry, Mr Grogneau. Right. 20 francs on number 14 to win. I must go. What? We must get ready for the fashion show. What? Are you asleep, Mummy? Hello, Mr Socoa. - How are you? - Hello. Come and visit us sometime. - Yes. - My wife bakes delicious cakes. Right, I won't forget. - Do you know them? - He's in my class. So, Absalom? Absalom lost. - What? - Singapore won. No way! He's due for the slaughterhouse! - He's useless! - What are you doing? - We lost. - We didn't! The guy in font bet on Singapore and Marylin was born there so I did what you did to Mr Grogneau and bet on Singapore. You bet on Singapore? What odds? - I don't know! - What were the odds? - 64 to 1. - 64 to 1? 64 to 1! Pardon. - Did you see Absalom? - Absalom? - I bet on Singapore. - You did? - He bet on Singapore! -Eh? - Who tipped you off? - The horse! What a lucky break! 120,000. You've cleared me out. - Sorry, I can't sub you. - I'm here, Socoa. For the heating engineer, Grogneau. So you're keeping your car? - Yes. - But I'd found you a buyer. It brings me good luck. Are you selling footballs now? - Yes. - Victoria! - Do you play football at school? - Yes! - Shall I get it? - Yes. - Sure? - Yes! We're at the garage, Mum. He's getting his car back. He hadn't gambled it away. I love being with him. He's taught me so much. He's taught me to watch out for Grogneaus. I'll explain later. I'm off to play football with Dad. Love you lots. - Mum can't come back tonight. - Really? Hello? Yes. So you're coming back tomorrow? Mr Choucard. No, she won't go to bed late. She won't go to bed late. Trust me, will you? Right. Goodbye. What do you want to do? - Shall I tell you? - Yes. I'd like us to be alone together for five minutes and do nothing. - We are alone. - I mean really alone. Are you asleep, Mummy? Mummy! - We didn't look hard enough. - We must call the police. The police are never there when you need them. - We must find him ourselves. - Augustin! - What about Augustin? - There he is, look. I was hiding in the flowers. Are you mad? - Emma didn't look properly. - Nor did you. When is the fashion show? The charges have been dropped. Your sister is being placed in your care. She is? She's not to be trusted outside on her own. I'll appeal to the European Court of Human Rights for wrongful arrest! Shut up or I'll give you the slap I've waited 20 years to give you! Thank you. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. You won't be seeing her any time soon. Hurry up, Marie-Thérèse. Here, take my clip-ons. They're not your style but maybe one day. Thank you. - Gentlemen. - Goodbye. It was brutal. You were right, those advertising people are awful. They make the army look like a charitable organisation. What is it, sweetheart? The audition was a nightmare. Mathilde hasn't stop crying since. Isabelle's in tears too. Don't meet us off the train. I want to stop off to visit my mum - in Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie. - What for? Hello? Here. We found these. The girl brought them back here. - The girl? - Yes. The guy she got them from has a son and he gave her toffees. - Would she recognise him? - Yes. To cap it all, one of our men brought her back here. So much for community policing! - Where's the mother? - There. - I'll speak to the kid first. - Right. Did the casting director say something unkind? - Tell Mummy. - She said I had monkey ears. What? Monkey ears! I heard her say the girls this year all looked too tarty or too stupid. Unbelievable! What a bunch of arseholes. - Is something wrong? - Are you OK, Mum? - What's going on? - I think this is it. - The first contractions. - Are you sure? - What is it? - Look, a snake! - Where? - There. - That's an eel! - Are you sure? - Open the sack. - No. - Hurry! - I don't like it! - Bruno! - What is it? All the eels have escaped! Châtel, take the helm. Get that one. Hurry! Straighten up! What are you doing? Take the wheel! This had better not happen again. All right? What's wrong? Is something wrong? I won't do it again. The children! Stay there. Chief Inspector. - Sarah. - These are my children! Inspector... Sarah, what have you done? - I don't know. - We don't know. Get a doctor, please! - Is something wrong, madam? - I'm about to give birth! - We need a doctor. - I'll get one. Any doctors on board? Are any of you doctors? I'm a doctor. And I'm the father! You'll be fine, madam. When is your due date? I know you. Captain, this is an honour. Stop bowing and scraping and do something. How frequent are the contractions? This train must be stopped immediately. It must be stopped now. She needs some fresh air. Call the boy's parents. Have you called the boy's parents? I need to hand Marylin over to the social worker. Where is she? Here, sir. I'm going to pass you to the lady. There. Are you OK? She lost her voice. Take care of her. Don't keep her in here too long. Call my wife for me, will you? Easy does it. Over there. I'm going to need some blankets. Watch where you're putting your feet. Find a farm. I need hot water and sheets. Put her down over here. - All right, Captain? - Yes. She shouldn't travel in her condition. - I agree. - But she's not just anyone. - She's a Captain. - Then she shouldn't have kids. - I've put the kids in your office. - The runaways' parents are here. - Do they know we've found them? - No. Well, what are you waiting for? There are too many people in this police station. Gentlemen, we've found them. They weren't really on the run. I knew it. My daughter would never run away. Running away from one's family is an act of rebellion. Gently, gently. - Are you OK? - Yes. Are you sure you can deliver a baby? Affirmative. I did humanitarian aid work in Nigeria... Spare me your life story! Gently. Thanks, guys. Give us some space. - Can I touch your pompom? - Go ahead. Thank you. I want to stay with Sarah and the others! He's got Stockholm syndrome. It wasn't a kidnap. They adopted him. It's lucky there are kids to look after kids. We could get a shrink to examine them. - Do you believe in that crap? - No, no. Augustin was lost. He was all alone. We asked people if they knew him but no one would answer. So we took Augustin. We fed him and read him stories. We sang, danced and played. - You took him to a fashion show. - Yes, he really enjoyed it. - He had a great day with us. - He wants to stay with us. These kids don't need a shrink. Thank you. One loony in the family is quite enough. Vitalie! These happy youngsters don't need one either. Such glowing complexions! It's a joy to see. Push, Captain. Push, push, push. Stop pushing. Breathe, Captain. Breathe. Gently, gently. And... push! Push, Captain. Push, Captain, push. Stop pushing. Stop pushing. Breathe. Breathe, gently. - How much longer will it be? - I'm going to miss my appointment. This is par for the course in our family. It is? I was born in a 747 flying over the Pacific Ocean. My mum was born on the Clemenceau, my grandma on the Orient Express and my great-grandma on the Titanic. The iceberg made her come early. I told you, Chief Inspector. Once a thief, always a thief. And a boy who robs his dad can steal a boat. He didn't steal it. It's ours. - The boat belongs to us, like. - Well, that's cleared that up. I've tried to teach my pupils. Just one word for each thing. Vaugelas' rule of grammar. A teacher should know better than to let his child roam free. I'm a revolutionary syndicalist who wants his child to blossom and not be enslaved to bourgeois values. I taught her to love books. It's only her imagination that roams free. - And her morals! - Madam... You're hardly qualified to comment. Push, push. Stop pushing, Captain. And push! Push, Captain. Push. Push, Captain. Push, Captain. Push! Stop, Captain. Breathe, Captain. Gently. I've come to see what's going on. This is my field so I've come to see. There's a woman giving birth. Which village is she giving birth in? That's hard to say. Had it been in that field, it would have been Saint-Viot. That one's in Saint-Michel-Chef-Chef. And that one's in Chauvé. This one's in La Sicaudais. Pretty name. Gently, breathe, breathe... stop! Do you believe in God? Don't be so nosy. Mind your own business. I was only asking. Jesus Christ! Bloody hell! - It's a boy! - A beautiful baby boy. A proper little soldier! - You can't park here. - I'm here to see your boss. What about? I need to give him something. Here... There. - That's fine. Don't be long. - Thanks. Always return what you find. It brings luck and friendship. A word of advice: don't keep your pin number with your card. - It's a gift to thieves. - My wife says the same. I've always had a terrible memory for numbers. I've always needed a crib sheet, even for my police exams! - You mean you cheated? - I was careful not to get caught. Sir, I'm going to need a car to take the girl to a home. Oh, Marylin! What are you doing here? I've come to get some papers. Me and Dad found the Chief Inspector's wallet so we came to give it back to him. Isn't your Mummy here? She wanted to talk to me, but... she lost her voice. That's it, Captain! - That's it. - What now? What's all this about a train? Congratulations, sir. What? In the fields? - Is this him? - Yes, we found 2 kg in his flat. - The kid went to his flat? - Yes. And you're OK? Are you sure? I know your grandma was born on the Titanic but that's no reason... - Don't go away. - It was his flat Marylin went to. - The stuff he sells is crap. - Bastard! Chief Inspector. - There are no bitter pills. - On your way! Let me go. You can't do this to me. I'm a father. My children need me! Need their next fix, you mean? He's a sensitive man. He's a different sort of family man to you. Take him away. When I was young, I nearly turned professional. You can't have scored many goals! Time to go, Victoria. Wait. Again. No hands! We won't be able to sleep at Sophie's. Don't worry. I've got it all worked out. Good evening. Please tell me you've got a room available. We're fully booked. - All the hotels in Nantes are full? - Yes. - Sure? - Yes. - There's nothing left? - Nothing. - Thanks. - You're welcome. It smells like a zoo in here! - You're staying here! - It's him or me. - Get in your room! - I'll get myself a pig, then. - Don't talk to me like that. - He's right. - Do you talk to your dad like that? - Her dad's not like you! - She wants to bring... - Shut up, Dad! I'm out of here! I'm going to stay at Virginie's. Sabrina! I'm sorry about my daughter. Please come in. What brings you here? We've got nowhere to sleep so I wondered if we could stay here. You said I was welcome any time. You are welcome and a room has just become free. Dad. I heard a sheep. A sheep? What are you talking about? Go back to sleep. Dad! - There is a sheep after all. - We'll never get any sleep now. - All right? - Yes, fine. Do you have somewhere my daughter can sleep? Yes, of course. Look who's here! Socoa's brought his family along. - Really? - Yes. Give me your shoes. She's sound asleep. I wanted to give her a good time but Sophie threw me out and I had to go to court. We argued, I hit her, she ran away. - What must she think of me? - Don't worry. At her age love is simple. She loves you as you are. - Really? - As long as you're there. - I'm not often there. - Well, be there. That's what her teacher said. I've left you some sugar. Shall I switch off the light? Sleep tight, darling. What are you doing here? Can't you sleep? - Go back to bed. - But I'm not tired. You can't stay here. Come on. Leave her. She's my lucky mascot. No, she needs to sleep. - Do as she says. - I don't want to leave you. Here. Take my hand. Pass. - Can she sleep on the sofa? - Yes! I love the sounds. - Let's put her on the sofa. - She'd be better off in bed. I'm cold. Here. Now sleep, OK? Can you stay with me for a bit? All right. Closer. Is that better? You know my dog, Courage? - You have a dog? - It's a cuddly toy. I had a dream earlier. I dreamt I gave it to Marylin. We were in this big room and I wanted to tell her something but she kept hiding. So I said to her: "Why are you hiding?" And she said: "I'm looking for you." Isn't that weird? No, it's not weird. We're all a bit like her: small and lost, in stations and police stations, unfamiliar places. Everyone needs love. What's sad is what some people have to suffer to find it. - Even as children. - Is that why you're always hiding? Like the girl in your dream? You're a smart cookie. - I'm right here. - All right. - Whose turn is it? - Mine. Sleep, Victoria! Sleep. No more boat trips! - Why? - Why do you think? There they are! You know, Dad, one of the men cheated last night. He did? Why didn't you say? - I was too scared. - You might have saved our lives. Do you know the Arabic proverb? "Keep quiet for a quiet life." Hello. You're so pale! What happened? Nothing. I had a great day with Dad. We walked along the river bank. - Did she go to bed late? - We were in bed at nine on the dot. Did you remember her sugar? Sugar. - We even stocked up. - So I see. Here's your school bag. - How did it go with Sophie? - Well, really well. We're going to be late. Quickly. You shouldn't have lied about Sophie. - Victoria. - Yes? - Your homework book. - Oh, yes. - Did you sign it? - Yes. - Have I signed it? - No. Why don't I sign it? Aren't I respectable enough? - You never sign anything. - Well, I'm going to from now on. Mr Esposito... Excuse me. - Do you have a pen on you? - Always. Where do I sign? There. Here. Will I see you next Wednesday? Of course. Every Wednesday and Sunday. I'm going to have to look after you. - He's a big kid, you know. - I know. - What are you doing, darling? - Hugging you tight. To reassure us. Why say you'll see her every Wednesday when you can't? Yes, I can. Where did you sleep? Don't lie to me. - I fell out with Sophie, OK? - But she's a nice girl. People are never what they seem. - Can I get in my car? - No. Where did you sleep? - Elsewhere. - Where? - With friends. - What friends? You know my friends! - Not that den of iniquity? - Look, we were among friends. What were you thinking? That's no place for a child! What does that mean? It's a perfectly suitable place for a child to be. She was made to feel welcome by some very kind people. It was better than a station waiting room. - I bet she didn't go to choir? - She did. We both went. We missed piano but we played football. She's a great little player. What else did you do? We walked and talked. I suppose you went to the betting shop? - We just popped in. - She'll tell me, anyway. - She picked the horse. - What did you say? She won. You're unbelievable! And you're getting worse. What if something happens to me? - Who'll look after Victoria, then? - I can look after her. You have no idea! Even your daughter thinks you're like a child! I can't take any more of this. Why do you have to be like this? - We need you! - Let me explain. Francesca. - Do you need a hand? - No, I'm used to this. Are you sure? Quite sure. Here. Have some sugar. See? I do remember what to do. - Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine. It's tiresome, this hypoglycaemia. Poor Victoria, inheriting it from me. It's a tiny defect compared to all her qualities, you know. I know. Of course you do. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. Go on, tell me. About my grandmother. She used to say that children choose their parents. Do you think she chose wisely? She won't know until the end of her life. - The end of her life? - Yes, the end of her life. I'm happy here. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
