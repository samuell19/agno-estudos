RUMBLE OF FOREST FIRES Joining us again now, someone we've been hearing from throughout the evening stating things very harshly, almost out of despair: Captain Hezi Levy, Haifa Fire Dept. Spokesperson. Since noon, we've put up dozens of control lines and every time we failed. The fire passed over us as if we didn't exist. Since the afternoon we have lost control. I want every one of Israel's 1,500 firefighters to get to their stations, join up with their commanders, and to get organized and come up north. If by first light tomorrow planes don't arrive, I'm very skeptical about our ability to stop this fire. In the end it will stop at the Mediterranean Sea. RUMBLE OF FOREST FIRES GENTLE WINDS Haifa is the third biggest city in Israel. All the new-comers who came in the late 40 s and the beginning of the 50 s came through Haifa. It s one and a half million We started to set up a country here, and a homeland for the Jewish people. It was a very significant place. Haifa is symbolically an essential part of the Palestinian experience, of Palestinian cultural, of the palestinian identity, regardless of all the changes regardless of the state of Israel In the collective mind of the Palestinians there is an image of Haifa as it was before 48. The Carmel Park, which is the biggest park in Israel, is situated at the edge of our city. And everybody who grew up GENTLE WINDS On that day there was a very strong eastern wind, about 30km per hour. A heatwave - very hot. Very high temperatures. All the most extreme conditions. GENTLE WINDS Until that day not a drop of rain had come down, even though usually by October-November rains have already started again. GENTLE WINDS We found ourselves in a situationwith very hot weather. The ground was completely dry. Low humidity and very strong wind. It was Thursday. There was a Hanukkah party for my daughter at her kindergarten, and suddenly people started talking. I was sitting in my office in the firehouse in Haifa on the second floor. There was a loud siren - the announcer reported a fire in the Carmel. One of many. I didn't consider it exceptional. WIND We have a big window facing the Carmel. I look and I don't believe what I'm seeing. A gigantic fire, like an atomic bomb that fell on the Carmel, with a huge mushroom of fire. We saw the smoke all the way to the hillsides over Neve Sha'anan, while the fire started in Usefiya. I realized then that this was a huge earthquake of a fire. A tsunami of a fire. WIND I don't even have the words to describe the intensity of the flames, the size of the fire, the speed at which it spread. It simply progressed from hill to hill without... I have seen many fires in open areas. Such a fast-moving fire front I do not remember. WIND I'm a young, new firefighter, who got his trial-by-fire in that big fire. I was on the job one week. I started on Sunday. Thursday was the fire. WIND The fire is starting to get out of our hands. There are very strong winds. We're trying to control it. The fire is skipping sideways every 100 meters. In every direction: south and north. ENGINES RUNNING You see an enormous ball of fire, truly enormous. And then you see it changing direction. Just like a tornado. Same thing. You see that fireball and it's something amazing. It makes a turn like a U-turn and comes back. It's something inconceivable. TRAFFIC Palestinian Civil Defense Jenin We were fighting another fire by Jenin. FIRE BURNING DRY WOOD The distance between Jenin and Haifa is between 20 to 30 kilometers. TRAFFIC We saw heavy smoke and thought it was an accident in Haifa. We were guessing that it was at the petroleum refinery. When we got back, we were told it was the Carmel forest. Of course we were upset about it. At the end of the day, Haifa is an Arab city, a Palestinian city that means a lot to us. TRAFFIC When we heard about the massive fire in the Carmel - it was clear from the start that it was a massive fire - I declared a mobilization of all Civil Defense departments and crews. WIND Palestinian Civil Defense - Ramallah Most of the guys here at Headquarters really wanted to go fight the fire. ENGINE RUNNING As a firefighter, I felt I should be there. We should be there, because our work, by its nature, obliges us to fight fire anywhere. ENGINES RUNNING The guys here started saying:"Let's go Abu-Karim, let's go to the Carmel." I told them that there are obstacles, permits and issues, so we can't immediately go there. After the 67 war, when Israel conquered the West Bank, it was possible for West Bankers to visit Israel. Many of them worked in Israel, toured Israel, and whatever. This ended in the first Intifada, which began in the end of 87 and ended in 93. Towards the end of the first intifada, most of the Arabs were not allowed into Israel because of security. And this is the situation until today. So, in order for them to come to Israel, they need to have special permits. Most of them do not get it. STRONG WIND AND FIRE BURNING We're two-and-a-half hours in now since the fire broke out, a fire that's accompanied by a massive fire front that's spreading, enabled by southwestern winds. The focus of the work now is to evacuate communities, to take people out of the forests. KNOCKING Security forces moved, door-to-door, to ensure no one remained at home. In most cases residents were evacuated in an orderly fashion, taking along with them only a handful of belongings, without knowing when this nightmare would end, and when they would be able to return home. SIRENS AND ALARMS It was about three o'clock. At 3:05 I was already in the police helicopter, flying between Usefiya, Beit Oren and Damon Prison trying to sketch a picture of the situation, and then I saw a scene I won't forget as long as I live. I saw nearly twenty vehicles - police cars, fire engines and residents - who were situated at the entrance to Beit Oren and were effectively trapped. A huge fire front, immense, closed in on them from three directions. SHOUTING All the firefighters already left? Everyone, everything will be okay. The windows are starting to explode. Don't tell me to relax. I'm afraid. SHOUTING Then I heard the first report over the radio about a bus being involved in the fire, with people trapped in it who are dying. It's hard to describe the frustration, despair and helplessness. Members of the security services know that about fifty of their friends are trapped a few hundred meters from them. They all burned! ROARING FIRE If this is what's left of the bus chassis, I could imagine what really happened there. I do not want to imagine what these people felt. These people were burned alive. ENGINES RUNNING IDLE This was a breaking point. All of a sudden forty-four dead? It was inconceivable. We couldn't understand it. This fire is a unique fire. It's a fire of international proportions. The required resources are not currently present in the field, but they are on their way. RUMBLE OF FOREST FIRE I understood from the Minister of Interior that the President instructed us to respond to the Israeli Prime Minister's request and to offer help to the crews fighting the fire in the Carmel. BIRDSONG DISCUSSION I convened the Civil Defense officers. We talked about the possibility of joining the firefighting effort. TRAFFIC I called Shimon Romach,Director of the Israeli Fire & Rescue Services, and offered our help should they need it. It was very obvious and natural to me that they would want to help. But given the atmosphere on-site it seemed unlikely that this assistance would be accepted. I started talking with police representatives on-site. The Northern Division Police Commander was essentially the commander at this event. The immediate response from him and from the Ministry of Defense was that we don't need the Palestinian firefighters and if they had to come that would just be a burden, because we'd have to do a security check, inclusive of their vehicles, at the entrance from Palestine to Israel and would also have to provide a security escort for the entire time. FIRE AND ENGINES Al Jazeera News Twenty airplanes joined the effort to put out the worst fire in Israel's history. Among them were forces from Turkey, which has experienced major tension in its relations with Israel. Jordan and Egypt also sent crews, as well as Russia, Croatia, Azerbaijan, France and Spain. PLANE ENGINES Saturday evening there was an on-site meeting with the Prime Minister. When we got to the agenda item regarding international aid, I told the Prime Minister about the willingness, and even beyond that, about the active push by the Palestinians to come and help. I was very happy that the Prime Minister recognized the positive potential represented by this issue and gave instructions to ensure that they would arrive. I am sure that there were some people who thought: "What? We, the State of Israel, need help from three Palestinian teams?" "That's going to make the difference?" But that is not the point. And I am glad that the Prime Minister intervened and decided as he did. WATER HOSE He called me on the third day, and said: "You told me that you are ready to assist. Do you still want to help us?" I replied, "Of course!" He said, "Now I'm asking for your help." Lieutenant Ahmad Rizek asked me to lead the Palestinian firefighting team. It took us four hours to get ready. I gave him the list of firefighters' names so he could get our crews entry permits to Haifa through Al Jalama checkpoint. Get ready. My father called and said, "Based on the Lieutenant's instructions you are going to the Carmel." My wife started crying and said, "Are you sending your children to get burned?" I told her, "No. This is our duty. This is what we do." The first person I told about going to the Carmel to help put out the fire was my mother. She said, "Go and may God bless you!" SIRENS The Commander of Services calls me, and says, "Giron, firefighters are arriving from the Palestinian Authority." There were people who said, "Why go?" And there were people who supported us. Many people said, "Sure, why not? It's our land and the Civil Defense should go and help there." Many people supported us. A Palestinian citizen might wonder, "These are Jews, why should we care?" But we, given our humanitarian qualities, our work and experience, we don't differentiate between Jews and Arabs, or Druze, Muslims or Christians. I was in a prison in the Carmel in 1997. There is a prison there called Al Jalama. When I heard that we would be going to the Carmel, I told my manager it would be very difficult for me to enter Israel, and that they wouldn't give me a permit. When we reached the checkpoint, we wondered how they'd treat us. How would we react if they opened the truck and inspected it? Until reaching Al Jalama security checkpoint, my one fear was that I'd have to exit the vehicle or be prevented from participating in my mission. ENGINES RUNNING Yisrael - yes, yes... The Israeli side cooperated with us because we were on a mission for them. The firetrucks passed with no inspection and they handed us permits to enter the state of Israel - the so-called state of Israel. And, we went to the Carmel. ENGINES This is the strange scene witnessed by anyone who happened to be at Al Jalama crossing this morning at the border with Jenin. - You have all my respect! Three Palestinian fire engines transporting twenty-one firefighters from Jenin, Bethlehem and Ramallah drive across the border and enter Israel. Their destination: the Carmel Forest. ENGINES RUNNING We had a very strange feeling going to enter an area we hadn't entered for eleven or twelve years. I mean, we are denied entry there. ENGINES On our way to the Carmel, we saw beautiful views. One of them was the sea. WIND This was the first time in my life I saw the sea. I've seen only the Dead Sea, and even that I saw only through a fence. WIND Most people in Jenin are originally from Haifa. If they're not from Haifa, they've at least worked there and remember it. I lived in Haifa for two years, before I joined the Civil Defense department. I worked there and I love the city. I really love that city. WIND As we entered the Carmel, we saw columns of smoke in various locations. The smoke in the sky reached heights above 100 meters. As we walked, I saw on my right these beautiful forests. And just behind us it was all black, with smoke, airplanes and all that. How would you feel to see all of these green trees, and at the same time all this fire? I said to everyone, "May God help us all." I arrived at the meeting point. I look at them. They're ready for the mission. And dressed to represent the Palestinian Authority. I told them in the simplest terms, "Take a look at each other and you see our profession. I look at you with prideat your willingness to come and help." ENGINES I felt that we nineteen Palestinian firefighters in the Carmel were being watched by all of Palestine- and all of the world. The fact that they were coming was no ordinary thing. You know what? Even whenthe Bulgarians came, and I'm talking about the firefighters themselves - not planes, planes arrived from almost everywhere in the world - even then it didn't make you go, 'Wow!' the way it did when the Palestinians came. A Palestinian crew coming to fight the fire, just like the United States and Russia, great countries - I consider us a great country too. We went to the fire. We were accompanied by an Israeli firefighting officer from Haifa. His name was Yisrael. He accompanied us all day. He guided us to the fire locations. We sat at the mountaintop of Beit Oren. I showed them what's burning, what's burnt. I saw the pain in their eyes. PUMPING AND ENGINES We went there on thethird day of the fire. The fire in the woods had been significantly reduced. When we arrived, the planeswere putting out the remaining large flames that could still cause the fire to spread rapidly. HEAVY PLANE ENGINE Planes can put out fire from one direction only: from above. When the water pours down it has an effect up to a point, but the trees' base keeps burning. This requires a firefighter to go right up to the fire and put it out. That the Palestinian firefighters arrived at this particular stage was important, because along with the Israeli, Bulgarian and other firefighters present, they went and put out that fire. In other words, it wasn't just a show to promote a value. They did the work - dirty work, but important work. PLANES PASSING OVERHEAD We feared that the fire will start again and spread to the surviving trees. WIND I was surprised to see a tree this wide, with roots as long as one, - two or three meters deep- on fire. The tree was on fire one to two meters underground. It's here. Bring an axe. Bring a shovel. Hurry up! Hurry up! There is fire underground. The temperature was very high. There was fire below us.The ground was really hot. There was a lot of smoke. ENGINES They took out spades. Wherever it was necessary to dig and bury embers with sand and soil, they did that. If it was necessary to extend hoses, they extended them. You see that they came to work. The embers will reignite the flames! We need to put this out or it will flare up again. When I toured the sector, I met with the three Palestinian teams at one of the sites they were assigned to protect. I spoke with them and thanked them for their goodwill and the assistance they provided. I also assigned them one of my men, an officer of mine, to accompany them wherever they were dispatched with their engines, and they worked together out on the field. It was no coincidence they called me, given that we maintain a very good relationship with the Palestinian firefighters. Assistance in Judea and Samaria is an everyday collaboration and nothing exceptional. We meet them often at fires, evacuations,road accidents and all kinds of other incidents. But when Palestinian fire engines drive into Israeli territories, inscribed with Arabic writing, and transporting Palestinian firefighters with the flag of Palestine on their uniform, that pretty much amazed the other firefighters, who had maybe only heard in passing, in meetings, of our routine cooperation. But now they were witnessing it in action. This was extraordinary from their point of view. HOSES It was stunning. We were surprised by the quality of their equipment. They had state-of-the-art equipment and new firefighting vehicles. It was validating. As a firefighter I like to see new firefighting vehicles. I was happy that the guys, our friends from Palestine, operate such new, high-quality firefighting vehicles. ENGINES AND CHATTER Something that didn't help us in the fire was the presence of the Israeli army. HOSES The escorts with us were armed soldiers. You move here or there, and you're always under observation, even though we were there to help them. ENGINES RUNNING Why do you monitor me when I camefrom Palestine to help you put out the fire? What else am I going to do? I'm putting out a fire. I'm not planting explosives. We continued working until late in the evening. Around 7:00 pm he tells me, "Yisrael, we might have to leave, but I want us to stay." I told him, "You know that if it's up to meyou'll stay even another two, three days." FOOTSTEPS After we finished putting out the fire,we left by a side road. Even as were coming out of the forest, we stopped to put out any fires we saw. We had a hose at the back of the truck. You saw it: They gave 100%. They gave their souls. After we left the forest and entered densely inhabited areas further from the fire, the Israelis announced the end of the work, and that the Carmel fire was extinguished. WIND When the work was done, Israeli officers and firefighters took us to have coffee. We talked about the future of the area, about peace, and about relations between Palestinians and Israelis. We felt a closeness between the Palestinian and Israeli crews. WIND BIRDSONG SOUNDS OF BUSY STREET They gave us entry permits for a few days. It's been fourteen years since I last visited Al Aqsa Mosque. It was an opportunity to go pray at Al Aqsa, because it is not easy to enter Jerusalem. When we went to pray in Jerusalem, we met a Sheikh. He was praying at Al Aqsa Mosque. He asked us, "Where are you from? What brought you here?" We told him we were fighting the fire in Haifa the day before. He said, "Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?" He said, "Aren't you ashamed of yourselves for fighting the fire with the Israelis?" I stopped him and asked: "Suppose I was on a main street, and in front of me there was a a settler's car with children inside. And, this settler was in an accident. The children are calling out, and you're the only one who can help. Are you going to save them or not?" He said to me, "That's a different case." I asked him, "Why is it different? Would you help him or not? If I don't save him then I am not Muslim. Neither my religion nor my duty as Civil Defense will be fulfilled." FLAG IN WIND Of course we heard some criticism, because this is an occupying country that we went to help. I consider all this land - whether the lands of 1967, 1948,Gaza or the West bank - I consider all this land ours. SOUNDS OF MARKET I went to the market and people were asking,"Why did you go there?" They said, "They arrested your uncle and your cousin. They killed your friends, destroyed houses in the camp, and killed people. And you go put out their fire?" CAMERA SHUTTERS We came back and were called in by President Mahmoud Abbas. He thanked us and told us, "You make us proud. You have all our respect." He told us not to mind criticism for helping put out the fire. We did nothing wrong in going there. In matters like these, put politics aside. I remember the President saying to me clearly: "You've done a excellent job, but remember: when a disaster happens anywhere in the world - whether in Palestine, the occupied territories,Israel or outside the country - and you're able to help, don't wait for instructions. You have my instructions now. There is no waiting in fighting catastrophes." Whatever you do, you'll find some people criticizing you and others supporting you. In the end, you'll do whatever you believe in. This is natural. Right? I want to point out that the Palestinians volunteering, and their arrival on the scene, in spite of the criticism they might have faced - and I assume they did face some criticismfrom people who don't understand, or don't in every case understand the role of firefighting - their bravery, along with the decision of the Palestinian leaders who made it possible, I think these will be remembered as a tribute to them for many years to come. CAMERA SHUTTERS There was political discussion about a ceremony in Jerusalem to honor crews who helped in the Carmel fire. CROWDS There were representatives from eighteen different countries. I noticed there were flags for all participating countries, but I didn't see the Palestinian flag. I told them I attended to represent my country as the head of a Palestinian institution. When the flags of participating countries are raised, mine too should be raised. Without seeing my flag, I would not participate in this ceremony. CAMERA SHUTTERS In less than five minutes, the Palestinian flag was raised onstage. APPLAUSE CAMERA SHUTTERS APPLAUSE What we witnessed last week in the skies above Mount Carmel, and in the forest below, in the forest below, should also give hope to all those who We saw that differences between nations can be put aside for the sake of our common humanity. And if this sprit of cooperation and this belief in our common humanity grows stronger in the years ahead, it can help lead a road to a lasting peace that can bring benefits to all. APPLAUSE Listen, around here we're not used to getting foreign assistance, because generally we're used to being the foreign aid. And here, in this situation, it's good when you see people coming to help you. It's admirable. It warmed the heart to see the people who came. They didn't come to play. They came and risked their lives. Especially the firefighters from the Palestinian Authority. That's a sensitive issue: Israel and the Authority. They came and gave of themselves and helped. They have all my respect. They deserve thanks. TRAFFIC Usefiya Local Council It was about a week after the ceremony in Jerusalem. I wanted to say thank you, to the people. Pilots and firefighters from the whole area, and all sorts of people came to help us. We didn't forget anyone, including the Palestinians, whom we invited. They invited us to a tribute ceremony. We wanted to go. The guys from Bethlehem came here, since the gathering point was in Jenin. They applied for permits, of course, because otherwise we can't go there. They called me from the Usefiya local council, and told me, "We're holding a tribute ceremony for the Palestinian firefighters who came and helped put out the fire by your house, near the village, in the Carmel Park and so on." No problem. I'm coming. "Come in dress uniform." OK. No problem at all. My brother was about to go, so I said, "Take a couple of trees with you and plant them there. Let's give a hand as Palestinians to build and replant that area." When we reached Jenin, we were still waiting for the permits. The permits were late. TRAFFIC The honoring ceremony was supposed to begin at one in the afternoon. The Israelis said they'd give us permits at eleven o'clock. We received a number of entry permits, but four permits for our colleagues were missing. He handed me the permits and I started looking for mine. I couldn't find my photo. Your photo is on the permit. He called from Jenin and asked, "Are you happy now?" I said, "About what?" He said the Jews didn't give him a permit and made him go back. Only seven out of the eleven who wished to attend the ceremony were granted entry. We were surprised they were denied entry for security reasons. First you let them in without any problem. You gave them permits for four days. I came and risked my life to put out the fire, and now you won't let me enter Israel to be honored? At the time, I felt people were right when they said: "Why did you go and help them put out the fire?" Honestly, I've applied several times for a permit and have asked why I can't get approved. I have never been to jail. There is nothing that should prevent me from getting the permit. My brother was in jail, but why are you punishing me because of my brother? I am one of those who did receive a permit, but I refused it. Our Director and the General Director also refused to go. When some didn't get the permits, we all refused to go. I spoke with some people, maybe nonetheless they would let them in. In the end they didn't allow them to enter. In response to all this... I canceled the whole ceremony. Politics shouldn't have been mixed into it. They should have come, like they came to the fire. They should have come for a quarter hour, half an hour, I don't know how long. We'd thank them, shake their hand and It didn't happen. Ultimately, it is an established fact that they do not take advantage of the firefighting services to harm Israel. The opposite is true. From what I saw in the media, it was an utter disgrace. What can I say? ENGINES RUNNING I don't know who to blame, what happened, what was coordinated, whether it was In the end it was not honorable. WIND INSTRUCTORS My vision, my hope or dream, is that there will be regional cooperation in the Middle East. All the experts sayan earthquake will happen. They just don't know when. The whole region is in danger. An earthquake doesn't take into account any green line or blue line or red line. If a disaster happens, God forbid, I won't hesitate to ask for international help from any country, including Israel. In the beginning, we didn't know how to take it: firefighters from Judea and Samaria coming to help the Israeli firefighters. But today when I think about it, it's clear, because a firefighter has values and norms that you won't find in any other emergency service. We have a common enemy: the fire. The relationship between firefighters is like a brotherhood. I consider firefighters one family. It pains me when I hear, for example, that a firefighter died in Jordan, or in Palestine or in America. Our relationship is that of one family. We have the same goals and we do the same job, wherever we are in the world. Look, I think these things are adding up. There's a cumulative effect. Let's say the next time there's a fire and they're asked to come and help, by then it won't be such an exceptional thing. The more cooperation increases outside Judea and Samaria , the more it'll contribute to increasing the closeness between the people. Maybe not between the leaders, but between the people, yes.
