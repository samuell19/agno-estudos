You Tube - Video Running Time 02:10:54 You Tube search name -Naujawan - 1951 My youth is a fireball, my youth, my youth Whoever comes to destroy it, they will burn Give me your heart unhesitatingly. I'm not afraid of anyone Those who clash with me will repent My youth is a fireball, my youth, my youth Whoever comes to destroy it, they will burn Raju! Hey, Kalu! Hey, Raju! Brother Raju, hey! What is it, damn you? Raju, see. Raju, see. Have you seen that? Shyama's. - What? - I say Shyama's coming. Wow, brother! Am I some watchman of your sister? - Shyama! - Hey! She's gone home, son. - Home? - Yes. - But let me know after all what... - Hey, wait! Listen to me! Where is Nagesh? Shyama! Hey, Shyama! Shyama! Take a look. See it with your own eyes. The cheat you love will be someone else's tomorrow. Tomorrow your Kishore is getting engaged. To a rich man's daughter. I tried to reason with you but you didn't understand. After all, this rascal deceived you. Brother! You know, people don't value compassion any longer. They only recognize money. Wealth. What do you have? It's said this girl's father is the wealthiest in the city. He has millions, huge houses... and has everything money can buy. You don't like this either? But I'm asking you what's the reason for this, Kamla? Three times this joke has been played out. Any boy I choose, you refuse him! Have you chosen someone else? What? No, papa. Uncle, the thing is, you take this as a game. - A game? - I mean, you don't even give her a chance. - Chance? - Yes, chance. After all, she's human, too. She wants that two hearts should first meet... and have some happy and sad moments. - Meaning, some romance and love should develop. - What? But dad, I, too, am a human. I, too, have a heart within me. I want that one should be in love before marriage. Idiot, has your father ever loved, that you'll have that? But, dad, what I say, too, is... I don't want to hear anything. Diwan Bahadur Ramcharan Das isn't such a fool, Bimla... that he'll hand over his daughter and wealth to any damn fellow. Idiot, it's property worth millions. - Oh yes, but is wealth everything... - Look... if you do otherwise... I'll skin you. Do you understand? Lala Shobharam! Sir! I'm making that idiot of a son of yours, my resident-son-in-law... because your family background is good. And in my eyes, a high family is a big consideration. Though I am aware... that you are especially greedy... and are ready to sell your son just for a few pieces of silver. - No, sir... - Keep quiet! Listen to me first. Yes, sir. Of course. You are aware that Kamla is my only daughter. And after me she will become the heiress. This is not only her good fortune... but also her misfortune. That's why I want to repeat a few of my conditions again. Yes, sir, you can of course... I recognize you very well. Yes, the first condition is... that after the engagement you'll not have any right over my property... or on your foolish son. You are selling him and I am buying him. - But, sir, how could... - If and but won't do Lala. Say either yes or no. Yes, sir, but... Again the same 'but'? I'm not used to such nonsense. If the terms aren't acceptable, then take away your son. Sir, how can this be? I agree to every term. I accept. Wedding rituals Uncle! Uncle, come immediately! Kamla has suddenly taken seriously ill! What? And even after it you snatch my husband on the strength of money... remember you will suffer all your life. You won't lose him even for a day... not even a moment. A moment! I'm asking what happened to her so suddenly? She was perfectly fine till this morning. Kamla. Dear Kamla! You don't know. You always calling to Lalaji. He came here. That's why I didn't understand anything... and when I understood, then I saw that... that's why I called you on some pretext. There were so many people sitting there, tell us... why are you throwing him a in dark well knowingly. - Tell us! - Kamla! First, tell me his name. - Name? - Name. Name? - Yes, name. - I haven't asked his name yet. After all who is he? Where does he stay? Where did he come from and when he came, why run? I didn't ask anything, papa. I didn't ask anything, papa! Don't make excuses, Kamla. I know you don't like Kishore. But now I wonder if something else isn't going on. - No, papa. that man was really... - Tell me the truth Kamla. Have you promised to marry someone else? - No, papa. - You're exactly right, uncle. Actually, she loves a handsome man. And both have committed to marry. No, papa. No. What are you saying? You shut up. And this young man isn't interested in your wealth. He didn't even know she was your daughter. No, papa. This a white lie. Don't lie! - Sunder! - Sir! Ask Lala to meet me tomorrow. But sir, this auspicious time... Let it go to hell! I don't understand how you could tell such a big lie. The time is such, sister... that the truth pours water into the home of lies. But now think of some name. - Name? - Yes, name, address, everything. If he asks who he is, where he's from, then what? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Perhaps you don't know... that during the time of your grandfather... if anyone had said such a shameless thing... his tongue would have been pulled out. And I, too, don't expect this from my own child. I'm surprised... that despite being my daughter and the education I gave you... - How long have you known him? - Rajkumar Saxena. What? That's his name, uncle. Rajkumar Saxena. Rajkumar Saxena. - His family? - What's to say about his family? He's rich, of royal ancestry. Right, Kamla? - Age? - That would be hardly 24-25. Right, Kamla? Okay, I wish to meet that young man. - This very day. - Today? Actually, presently he's in Burma. - Burma? - Burma. He has his father's business there. Right, Bimla? - When does he return? - After four or five... - After a month. - One month? I can't wait more than fifteen days. Wire him immediately... that he should return within fifteen days and meet me. Okay, grandpa. Okay. But keep in mind... this Rajkumar Saxena... if he doesn't return in fifteen days, I won't wait a day longer. Got it? - Sunder! - Sir. Call Lala soon. And ask the priest... to find another date for the engagement. - Got it? - Yes. Now tell me. What's there? Come with me to the club. You'll find everything. Everything will be fine. Let everything be right. There are a thousand young men in the city and you can't find anyone? The man you're looking for... he'll show up at the very place. Just you wait. No! Oh, my love, my love Oh, my darling, my darling Darling, oh my darling Oh, my darling - I and you. - My darling - You and I. - My darling I and you, let's both be together With eyes in eyes and hands entwined I and you My darling You and I My darling I and you, let's both be together With eyes in eyes and hands entwined Let the envious be jealous, whoever they are I and you, let's both be together Come my dashing darling, come Pour the nectar from your eyes, darling come The atmosphere is alluring, the night is intoxicating And the youth, too, is at its peak, come My darling, oh my darling Let the envious be jealous, whoever they are I and you, let's both be together With eyes in eyes and hands entwined Let the envious be jealous, whoever they are The heart is full of romance I am yours and you are mine The heart is full of romance Because you are mine and I am yours My inviting eyes, silky arms invite you, come my love - Oh my darling. - Oh my darling Let the envious be jealous, whoever they are I and you, let's both be together With eyes in eyes and hands entwined Let the envious be jealous, whoever they are - My darling. - My darling But running won't do. Do you know how many days are left? I told you I can't do this. Can't do it. How won't it happen? Just take a good look at this. - Who's he? - Mathur. - Mathur? He's a very honest man. If you say, I'll make the offer. Damn you! - Hey, Sunder? - Yes, sir. I'll tell papa tomorrow. Oh? Yes, I'll tell him. You're a liar. Lies? Now you dare accuse me of lying? - Sir, I mean... - I understand what you mean. My daughter, if she lies to me I'll shoot her. Got it? That's young man's name is Rajkumar Saxena. When he's here, take a good look at him. But I'm sure... that he'll be better than your idiot son. He's staying at the Hotel Empire. Pay him a lot of money to act a prince. And suppose papa really marries me off to him? If it comes to that, then we'll see. We'll see... If he isn't approved, then pay a thousand rupees more... to make him go away. Then you're free. He'll go away? People will do anything for money. But look... first, don't give him your real name. Tell him Sushila or something. Sushila? My dear, one should be careful in such matters. I don't like such matters. Not at all. Kamla, have you had a reply from the Burma man? Yes! Yes papa, don't worry. He'll be here at the last moment. What say you, Kamla? Yes. You heard? Look, the new deadline is the 24th. If Rajkumar isn't here, then it's Kishori Singh. But this date won't be postponed. Got it? Come. Now what will happen, Sushila? Okay, explain. What will I do in Burma? Not Burma. The work is right here in Bombay Really? You see, the job isn't difficult... but you have to promise one thing. Promise? Yes. - Whatever I say... - Yes. No one should know. I see. - Look, Mr. Mathur... - Madam, I understand completely. But... Money? Don't worry about the money. Here, a thousand bucks. An advance, right now. But... First the job, then the money. Oh, wonderful. Okay, tell me, what's the job? Job? Oh, job! You see... I am... - I mean you are... - Of course, me. - Mr. Mathur. - Yes. Can you lie? Lie? Yes, the thing is, Mr. Mathur... Rani! But I say it from the heart... I don't like it so cheap. Johnny? Mathur isn't found anywhere but here. Of course, no place. - Boy! - Boy! Won't you have something to eat? No, I am... - Please! - Please! Johnny! Hey, boy! Boy, bring four meals. Make it quick. But mister... Madam, I was here first... so you're my guests. - What would you like? - What? - Of course, but... - Well, how nice. - I love to meet new people. - Yeah, love to. Johnny? Meet myself, Gwen Fernandez. How do you do? I just remembered something from long ago. When I met Johnny for the first time... In a Chinese hotel. Someone took my purse. - Hello! - I'm very sorry, very sorry. You'd better take care of your purse, lest it gets lost. I'll be back in few minutes. - Wait, listen to me... Let's sit here. He'll be back. Johnny. Johnny? Johnny, my money! - Five hundred rupees! - Rupees? Where is that man? Where that rascal gone? Rascal! Hey, Mr. Rascal! Johnny! Johnny, you... - Call the manager. - What, manager? Manager! Hey, manager! Manager! What, some pebble in the food? - No. - What happened? No, please, no sir. Just I was... I don't want anything. I want my money. 500 rupees. - Will you listen to me? - I won't listen to anyone. I'll go to police. No, I don't know her. I don't know him at all. - He stole my thousand rupees too. - You're lying. You're his partner. You know him. I'll hand you over to the polics. Police! Yes, Ms. Sushila? To start with, I doubt your real name is Sushila. Secondly, you don't want even to reveal your father's name. What's this have to do with my father? Look, if you don't believe me, here are my ornaments. My necklace, my bracelets. - My necklace is worth five thousand. - Five thousand? I don't want your necklace. I want my money, you know. - Then you don't get your money. Look... - Why not? Quiet. I have told you... I told you I don't know the man. - Quite, please. - I don't know the man. Please, Miss, don't... - What do you think of yourself? - Sushila! See, if you don't give the name and address of your father... we'll have to put you in lock up. Lock up? - Constable! - Sir. Inspector, my father... - My father would kill me. - Madam, please. Don't cry. Sushila! Hey, bring water quickly. Bring water. Inspector, sir... my papa's name is... Sushila? Sushila, I told you many times... to keep your distance from gentlemen cheats. Inspector, this poor girl is unnecessarily implicated. I'll compensate the loss. How much is it, madam? Five hundred rupees. Speak softly. I'm not deaf. Five hundred rupees! - Here's your money. - But first tell me who you are. Me? I'm Sushila's uncle. - Uncle? - Yes, dear. Don't worry. I'll get you released right now. Here, take it. Count it, one, two... Three, four, five. Here you are. Are you happy now? Thank you. Thank you very much. - Uncle? Come dear. Let's go home. Uncle? Yeah, uncle. No, Sushila. It was my duty. If a man doesn't come to assist a man, will a demon come? Come, I'll drop you at home. - Where do you live? Me? I stay at... - Where do you stay? - Empire Hotel. Okay, then I'll return your money tomorrow. - Bye. - How will you get home? - I'll make it. - Sushila. Don't you worry, my home is close by. Yes, but listen to me. Go carefully, Sushila. Want to give your life? See you. Uncle. You saved me twice. I won't forget you for as long as I live. Uncle! Have you ever been to Burma? - Burma? - Actually, the thing is I'm... Okay, I'll tell you tomorrow, at your hotel. Very well. I will wait. Okay? Ta ta. Ta ta. Hello! Library. Vimla! Do you know why Kamla is so sad these days? Sad? I notice recently you two are up to something. Will Rajkumar Saxena not come? Of course, why won't he come? - Why won't he come? - Then what's the matter? The thing is... we are afraid, when he comes... you might not like him. - Like? - Yes. Dear, instead I'm very happy... that man really likes my child... and not merely my wealth. Vimla! I'm very eager to meet that man from Burma. I, too, am very anxious to meet him. Will every man turn out to be bad? What's to worry about in this? If I were you, I would have chosen instantly. Look at him. Preetam Pande. How is he? Hey, Kamla! Hey, listen! What are you doing? Preetam Pande... Right now I'll go and tell papa everything. Kamla! Oh my God! - Papa, that guy from Burma... - Has he come? Is he here from Burma? No. Not yet. But he'll be here soon. Certainly. He'll be here before the date. - Payal? - Yes, sir? I'm asking, is Kamla well? She is fine, sir. Why are you so scared? In this guise even his father won't recognize him. Remember, you're my maid. Got it? - Maid. - Bravo. Okay, take a good look. He's coming. Is he the Preetam Pande? And he's willing? If I ask him to jump in a river, he would and die. - But first ask him? - 'But' won't do. You agree? Okay, fine! Bravo, maid! Well done. Here's 100 rupees tip. I'll be back. But, maid... Beware of loafers. Here's some roasted nuts. Okay. Here's the money. 100 rupees? Give me change. - But I don't have... - Take this one anna and get going. - What are you staring at? - You? - Me? - I've seen you many times. - Where? - Right here. I often come here. And when I come I fall asleep. And when I sleep I have a dream. Always the same dream. You know who comes in that dream? Who? - You. - Me? The same eyes. The same features. Same voice. Are you married? What? No. Thank god. I, too, am still a bachelor. - But... - But I've been dreaming of you for a year. Waiting for you for a year. And now you're here. Haven't you ever seen me in your dreams? No. Never. I don't want to. Understand? Just that. Hey, wait, listen to me. Hey, what's your name? Hey, mister! See, she's leaving. What do you want? One anna coin. Here, take it. But stop following me. Now what? Why are you after me? Can't you find any other place? Here, 99 rupees 15 annas. And this place isn't that of your father. Got it? Ramdulari. Did you see the maid? Considers herself a fairy angel. Mister, I don't want to talk to you. Got it? Hey, I'm talking to this monkey. Because we're old friends. Any objection? Wow, what a killing walk! If had such a beloved, it would be wonderful Heard it Dulari? If had such a beloved, it would be wonderful I'm attracted by your enmity Okay, Dulari, let's go.

Cool breeze, come and soothe The ambiance is young, you are here, how do I forget? Cool breeze... How do I forget? Perhaps the guy from Burma is here. I say, what's his name? - I don't know. - Don't know? But who is he? Where's he from? I didn't ask anything. Then this man must be very dangerous, Kamla. Yes, the man does seem very dangerous. Oh, so the desire to meet has brought you here? I'm not here to meet you. Get it? I see. Then, good bye. - Hey, wait! Wait. - Speak. I... I want to ask you something. But... Okay, what's your name? My name? Rajkumar Saxena. Rajkumar Saxena? You mean you're afraid of my name, too? No. No, wait. Have you come from Burma somehow? Yeah, I was in Burma for four years. Four years. No. No!

Shaila! Oh Shaila! Nobody here! Come on, it's only us here. Come. Come on. Go in. Take off your clothes and hide. I mean, change into something else. Listen! Will anyone come here? No, madam. Who'd be so unfortunate? Wait, listen. You... I... Look, you have to change clothes on your own. I can't help you with that.. Got it? Where will you take me? Hey, what are watching? Haven't you ever seen a girl? Come on, get going. Go. Go. Ok, Vimla. How is that man? Have you seen him? Yeah, a glimpse. Glimpse? I mean, from a distance. Oh. Okay, how does he look? Good, tall and well built... a real manly type. Where will you take me? Where will you take me? O my tormentor darling, where will you take me Wow! What a change! Like the female monkey has covered herself with pajamas. Why, you said nobody will come here? Who said I wouldn't come, too? - But who was that man? - Which man? How would I know? Must be some loafer like you. Like me? Oh, that fellow! Look, things here will be this way. Leave if you don't like it. The door is that way. And if you like... have some tea. Here take this, flowers. Why the flowers? Flowers? For no reason. No specific reason. Hey, these clothes, why are they scattered? You're a maid. You can't even do your own work? How'd you work for a lady? Come, get to work. - But I had... - Come on! Don't worry. This man is our landlord. - What? - Yes. He's very wealthy. But has only one offspring. That, too, a girl. - Yeah? - Yes. Has a place to stay in... where three hundred could stay but only three... at the moment. Do you know him? Me? This picture is cut from a newspaper and pasted here. Every morning and evening I take a look at him. And tell myself, "Raju"... "do whatever you like but never become loathful like him." Such people have ruined the nation. - Do you know him? - Me? No. As he is here, and you have seen him... Kamla has gone to receive him. So, where is staying? He might not have arrived yet. Hasn't come? What? Actually, he keeps coming and going. He has no particular place to stay. But the man is excellent. - What? - Kamla becomes docile with him. Okay, tell me. Where do you stay? What? In my house. Really? Your parents are alive? - Have no mother. - Father? - Father is there. - What's he do? - What? - I asked what your father does. Does? He doesn't do anything. So, he's jobless? Of course, the country is facing lots of joblessness. That's why you have to work, right? Yes. When I returned from Burma, I was jobless royally. I had no meals, or even a shelter overhead. I went to roaming the streets on an empty stomach. I had water for dinner and slept. Know where? On the footpath. Have you ever sleep on the footpath? Hey! What? No, not yet. Are you crying? No. - What's your name? - Kamla. Kamla? - Yes... no... - Wow, strange! It's strange, sir. You don't know when he left, when he returned... or where he's lodging? Okay, where do his parents live? Actually... he's alone in this world. He's alone... - Alone? - Yes. Is he totally alone? Yes. And this outfit, I wear it. Any objections? Whose clothes are these? - Shama's. - Who is Shama? A girl. - Quite beautiful. - What's she to you? Who is she to you? Why do you care? No reason. - Just like that. - Now don't hide, tell me. - Yes? - Yes. What do you think? Ask from your heart. Have you asked? - What does it say? - It says... I'll tell you tomorrow. Where, at the Rani Baug zoo? I'll come here. - May I? - Oh! So, now you're inviting yourself over? Come on, come on. Bimla! I doubt that whatever you've told me, everything is... But uncle, I never said anything. All this was my guess. What? Just a guess? Hey, where will you take me, my tormentor? Where will you take me... Are you leaving? Yes. Your clothes are drying and I'm going to work. Apart from that, today I'm... afraid of you. Where will you take me... Hey, are your intentions good? Intentions? I said, if you like something tell me so. Or it may happen you flee with Shyama's clothes. You think I'm a thief? No, ma'am. The fault is with my heart. Bye. Hey, I said bye. Bye. Yes. What a beautiful voice. Bye. Where will you take me, my tormentor? Where will you take me, my tormentor? Let your Rajkumar Saxena go to hell! I just want to know where Kamla has gone! Ooh! Kamla? Don't panic uncle. Don't worry at all. In the end, everything will turn out alright. Alright? My foot!

This... can I give you this? Two rupees eight annas. I have nothing but this. That's the problem. You have nothing but that. But that doesn't work, madam. - Can you eat it? - No. - Can you wear it? - No. You can throw it and make a man an animal... but can paste it and drive your father's car? - No. - No. You need a laborer for it. But a laborer, with money. A laborer too is a human being. Madam... not an animal. Now, go and ask your father what all this means. Where will you take me... oh tormenting eyes? Where will you take me oh tormenting eyes? Is it my fault my papa is wealthy? Am I not a human being? - My pain, my sorrows, are they nothing? - Enough! Who hasn't a problem in this world, madam? Look at me. Look at this. This beautiful roof... which leaks when it rains. I haven't paid the grocery bill for three months. I want to buy a machine... but have no money. Mother is in Burma but I can't bring her home. Brother's in a mental asylum, but I can'tpay for the treatment. Yet I didn't go to you or your father. So why have you come to me? I... You... Didn't Shyama tell you anything? Yes, she did. She told me everything. You wanted me to deceive your father? Yeah, just because you're in trouble... and my name is Rajkumar Saxena, that was my use. But, for how long would this drama have carried on, madam? Four days? Or eight days? As long... As long as you could dare. Oh, I see. And... my remuneration? Whatever... Whatever you wanted. I don't trust cowards, got it? And how could you imagine I'd agree to this foolishness? Do you think I've fallen in love with you? Or am I some guy who'd paste on a mustache and agree for few rupees? So, ultimately you're a laborer. Just a laborer. Here, take it. Two and half rupees. Your labor charges. The rest is the tip. I salute you, madam. This is how you've valued me? I would have let you go. But, you said you'd give whatever I asked? Damn! Take this, take this. I... Keep away from me! Now I'll never have to see your face ever again. Man, who is this girl? Wherever I go, there she is. Bro! Brother! Raju! Raju! Raju. - Where's Shyama? - What? I'm asking where Shyama is? Wow! Am I some detective? I say, it's 35 minutes to 9... and the Burma guy is nowhere? He'll be here in five minutes. - Oh. - Yes didn't Kamla tell you? He'll be here. Bimla, when he comes, you two stay put here. Yes. I want to talk to him alone. - Got it? - Okay, uncle. Preetam! Hey! What's there to be nervous about? Okay, what's your name? Preetam Pande... No, Rajkumar Saxena. - And yes. - Where are you from? - From Burma. - What do you want? - To marry you. - Not me, to Kamla. Yes, with Kamla, Kamla. Papa, I have something to say to you. Don't worry, dear. If that boy is good, I'll approve of him. But the thing is, papa... Look, Kamla... I'm your father, not your enemy. Yes, yet... When is he coming, Preetam? He might be here. Kamla, until I call you, don't come down. Got it, dear? Sunder! He's here. Hurry. - Sir? - Damn you... Go there. Quick. Who called you? You're such strange man! Whenever you come, it's with your version of a son. Is it my house or a zoo? Sir, I thought... Thinking isn't your job. Sit down. I'm asking you to sit there! Don't move an inch from there. Who are you, prince? I... I... I mean, I am... Yes, you. - From where have - you come? - From there. - From there? - I mean... Bimla knows everything. Oh! You are that young man? Young man... No, no. Young man? Yes. Young man. Your good self? Hey, I heard you're a tall strong man... but what I see is worse than a woman. Is your mustache real or did you paste it on? - What work do you do? - What? - I'm asking what you do. - Work? - That my father does. - Wow, so your father works. And you just go seducing girls? Who are you, mister? Guess. After all, who else I can be? Who is that person you are so eager to meet and... with whom your daughter is in love? Look mister! I don't like such bad manners. Speak softly. I'm not deaf. - Sunder! - Yes, sir. Call Kamla. I want to know what's going on here! - Fine, sir. - Look here... if you're the young man, then who his he? Better ask him. - What's your name, son? - Preetam Pande. What? Preetam Pande! Why didn't you say so before? But you never asked. Damn you! Is he the same young man? Hello, madam! You! Why are you here? To marry you. I'm asking his name. Name...? Rajkumar Saxena. - You mean the Burma man? - Yes, from Burma. - Then, why are you so scared? - Scared? She's not scared, sir. It's just the difference of the mustache. - Mustache? - Yes, the fact is... earlier this man was clean shaven. Like you. But, now I've had this new fad for a few days now. - Tell me, should I remove the mustache, Kamla? - No! But I mean, it looks fine. The mustache. Thank you very much. Now your acceptance, sir. I still have many things to ask you. Of course, go ahead. Whatever you wish you may ask. This man's style is that he never lies. - Yeah? - Yes. This is a good thing. But first, tell me... - what's your profession? - Profession? Just as I asked, sir. Kamla, didn't you tell papa? Anyway, I'll tell him. Don't worry, whatever I say will be the truth. So sir, my profession is... of hard labor. - Yeah? - Yes. I work so hard, how to say it? Not one of you sitting here can do it. Meaning not even Kishore? Sir, not just Kishore but even his father can't. - Is that so? - Yes. Because we eat honest meals, no free lunches. But sir, ask him his income? Yes. - By income you mean earnings? - Yes, earnings. - This question is certainly tricky. - You heard? As far as my earnings go... Should I say, Kamla? You know I never lie. - Then why ask me? - Kamla! No problem, sir. Such squabbles are normal. Otherwise, what's the fun in life? Don't worry. I'll tell everything gradually. So, sir. Nothing is definite about the income right now. - Sometimes something or other... - Even then? For example, today's income... - 1800 rupees. - In one day? - Oh, no. In five minutes. - In Five? You heard, Lalaji? And some days people throw bundles of notes at my home. - Oh! - Ask her. Now the situation is, I have no respect for money. I just need your daughter. Right, Kamla? Did you hear, Lalaji? Yes, sir, but what's your order for us? In my opinion, your stuff won't be of use here. Why don't you find some other customer, sir? You girl, why are you so nervous? After all, that poor fellow loves you. Not love. He's here to avenge the insult. Is that so? Yes? I don't know what things he might tell papa. This man seems to be very dangerous, Kamla. And tomorrow is the auspicious date of your engagement. Hey, you seem to be very interesting man! Sir, this humble man has many qualities you'll get to know gradually. - You see this mustache? - Yes. - It's only for Kamla. - Only for Kamla? It irritates her, that's why. - Will you tell Kamla? - No. It's fake. I won't marry you. Not at any cost. Never... Not only you, your forefathers will. Look, get out of here. Or what? Or I'll inform papa about everything. - Everything? - Everything. - Even that the man you love is a laborer? - Yes. Who say... Who says that I... Hey! Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror? Now I'm seeing my face... in your eyes. You... You are a dangerous man. Now go and tell your father, the man you fell in love with... is a manual laborer. Go! I, too, would see your courage! Coward. Where will you take me... Where will you take me, oh tormentor eyes? Hey, look and see. Whatever you do, victory is mine Oh tormentor eyes, however hard you avoid it... it's hard to escape me. Make your eyes understand that Wherever you go I will come with you as your shadow Hey, look and see. Whatever you do, victory is mine You were so lucky to get a man like me And I am such a lucky man that you called on me yourself Look at God's power that you found a diamond on the street Hey, look and see. Whatever you do, victory is mine Where will you take me... Where will you take me, my beloved, oh tormentor eyes? These tormenting eyes of yours are crazy after your eyes Slowly this heart became yours, my love, without being close What's lost, what's gained, only hearts are exchanged Hey, look and see. Whatever you do, victory is ours Hey, look, see Hey, what it is, look, look Hey, look and see. Whatever you do, victory is mine Only five minutes are left for the auspicious time, sir. - Sunder! - Yes, sir? Go quickly, call Rajkumar here. Okay sir. Keep watching with open eyes... at the wonderful boy I've chosen for my Kamla. He's a gentleman, young and hard working. And I can't express what wonderful company he is. And when you see him, I'm sure you'll be amazed. Don't worry, sir. Don't worry. It's the same man, but with a difference. Now if you don't like it, that I am here... and if you don't like the clothes, then here they are. Marry your daughter off to these trousers. Sunder! Ram Singh! - Where the hell are you? - Sir! Sir! Don't just stand there. Kick him out. Hold on. Hold on. First, put this girl under lock and key. Because every rich father must do this. - Mister! - But keep in mind... one day this girl will break every shackle and come to me. And she'll never leave my side until the end of the world... or I'll consider her a coward... in whose veins water flows, instead of blood. - Sir, did you like this drama? - Drama? Yes, a drama. What are you people looking at? Give a clap. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Enough, enough. And here, look at this. I was paid 1800 rupees for this drama, got it? Much more than my annual income. Thank you, madam. But, mind you, not just you, but even your father can't buy me. Because my price is your heart. Not these currency notes. Such a lie! Such deception! Such craftiness! How could I know this is how my daughter would repay my love? - Now, let it be, sir. - Keep out of it, Lalaji. Kamla, how dare you? - Sir, inspector Tandon is here. - Who's here? Sorry, I came to return this necklace. And if she's your daughter then she's the Sushila who was caught stealing. - Kamla? - Yes, it's true. Whatever your heard, everything is true. And what you didn't hear is also true. - Lalaji? - Yes, sir Bring Kishore immediately. - Right now, sir? - Yes, right now! Kamla's engagement shall take place today. Very good, sir. I'll bring him in ten minutes. One day this girl will break every shackle and come to me. And she'll never leave my side until the end of the world... or I'll consider her a coward. A coward. Kamla, what are you doing? Listen to me. For God's sake don't do this. Kamla. Kamla! Kamla, I won't let you do it. Not at all. Sir, I am ruined. I am damned. I am totally ruined. This is all that rascal's doing, sir. You shut up, Lalaji. What's the matter, Sunder? Rajkumar had made Kishore run off with some girl. He had them elope, sir. Made them run off somewhere. What? Perhaps that cheat doesn't know... the best young men are dying to become my son-in-law And maybe both of you think I'll have to bow to that Rajkumar? I've found a new boy today. Uncle! Tomorrow morning at eight, Kamla will be married. - Sunder! - Sir? If either of them even step out of the house... then I'll break your bones. Sir, it's not my fault. I'm not at fault at all. I was watching all night, sir. - Perhaps from the rear door... - Shut up! Bimla, do you know where she went? Raju. I said it's morning. Dear. Oh tormentor eyes. Raju! Is someone else with you? - No, no. No, I'm telling the truth. - I don't believe you. Tell me where that rascal has taken her? But make it quick. We have no time, Raju. Why are you sitting? Go get a taxi immediately. - Taxi? - Yes, we have to leave. Kamla! You have come on the sly. Haven't you told anyone? You came running like a coward? Can't you understand that to escape from papa's golden cage... - I had to... - Cowards have no right to be free. Freedom is born here, Kamla. In the heart. But you, you've brought your chains with you. Don't you understand... that these chains will take you back from where you're trying to escape? But... But, this is my mother's jewelry. My mother left it to me for my marriage. These are mine. Not papa's. Go it? - They are all mine. - Without work nothing can be yours. Kamla, make a decision. You love me or these chains. No, Raju... Do you love me or these chains? Papa. Where is he? - Where is that human child? - Papa! - Papa! - Move aside! You've no right to be here. You go away from me. - Or else I'll shoot each of you. - Do it. Shoot. Riddle us with bullets. But, now I won't return to your golden cage. I shall not. Will not. Golden cage? I see this human child has taught you a lot. Stealing jewelry from home... rebelling against your father. You have really taken up a wonderful profession. - But have you ever known my name... - Papa! Here's your jewelry. What nonsense? Take away your jewelry. From today I'm not your daughter. And you... aren't my father. Now I shall live with him... and die with him. Dear, are you angry now? You know these ornaments belonged to your mother. Yes. But he doesn't want anything but me. - How can you say that this man... - Papa! Dear. Kamla. Are you sure, confident... that he only loves you, not my wealth. Yes. I am confident. Then... the decision is made. Then what was the need to run? Come with me. I'll arrange for your marriage. - Papa! - My child. My child, I'm your father. Not your enemy. Raju. Raju! Did you hear? Raju! Papa is willing. Raju! I'll go now. Papa. - Dear. - I'm ready to come. Papa. I'll do whatever you say. I'll do whatever you ask. Papa! No, you can't do this. You can't deceive me. Papa, papa! You won't get anything by deceiving me. Nothing. Papa! Now I'm not scared of you. Now I'm not scared of anyone. Papa! No, papa, no! No. For god's sake, don't oppress me like this. Papa, you promised. You'll have to fulfill it. Papa! Papa... If my mother was alive today, would she have done this to me? Papa, papa! Papa! You are not my father. You're my enemy. Yet you can't separate us. No power on earth can make us part. Papa, papa! Papa! My heart calls you, my love, come to me The world knows nothing but how to antagonize the heart The world has become the enemy of the four-letter word The world has become the enemy The world knows nothing but how to antagonize the heart My hopes have been shredded In exchange for the heart, I have found separation I have yearning for you and desolation within me I didn't know it earlier That falling in love is so painful The world has become the enemy The world knows nothing but how to antagonize the heart The world has become the enemy of the four-letter word The world has become the enemy The tears which come to the eyes, they'll show your image I shall just keep waiting I didn't know it earlier That falling in love is so painful The world has become the enemy The world knows nothing but how to antagonize the heart The world has become the enemy of the four-letter word The world has become the enemy The world has become the enemy of the four-letter word My heart is calling for you. Darling come back Hello, madam. Raju! Raju! Good that you've come. Want to declare it to the entire family? No. I want to let the world know that you have come. But why did you come like this? - If Papa comes to know then... - I've come to tell you something. But everyone is awake. And if papa sees us, he'll shoot. - For God's sake you... - Coward. Does one face trouble like this? - No but, Raju... - I'm here to say something, Kamla. Something was within my heart... but I forgot to say it. What it is? There was never anyone as beautiful as you... not now, not ever. Alas, I've fallen in love with you... and I can't live without you. Raju! Raju, please leave from here. Raju! Raju! For God's sake pity me. Raju! Shoot me, sir. But what I've come to say, I won't leave without saying it. It's clear you don't want a son-in-law like me. I, myself, hate the very sight of you. But, alas, you're her father. Perhaps you think by separating us this story will end. But I'd say even in ten years it won't happen... because we're both willing to wait a lifetime Today... tomorrow... even in a year... or after ten years, whenever she gets a chance, she'll elope. And then, would that save your family's prestige, sir? Maybe, you've thought of something else. - Perhaps you want to forcibly marry her... - lmpossible! I'll give up my life before seeing anyone else's face. Heard, sir? Now, either you'll have to accept our marriage... or you'll have to guard your daughter day and night. And if you love to be a jailor, then congratulations on your appointment. I have no objection. But I feel, by morning you'll come your senses. And you and your grandparents will take pride in this alliance. I only came to say this... but you can't say I didn't give you a chance to fire. Bye, madam. Bye, rich man. Where will you take me... Where will you take me? Where will you... Where will you take me... Young man, what do you want to forget Kamla? Meaning money? Whatever you say. Don't you see anything here you'd like? Of course there is. Then, tell me and it's yours. Now and right here. Your daughter Kamla. I don't believe... there's any man in this world who can't be bought. And you think he loves you? But if I put you in one hand... and half a million rupees in the other hand... will he choose you? Yes. He will choose me. You're crazy. Totally mad. I'll prove that human child... doesn't love you, but my wealth. Kamla! Kamla tell me... Bimla! Where's the key? Hurry, tell me. Ramsingh! Sir. - Sir? - Stand guard at the gate. If anyone enters this room today... then you are fired. Got it? Mister! Mister! I am Bimla. I said, come out quick. I have some private work for you. Hey, come out right away. Someone will come. Look, the letter Kamla has sent... remember no one should learn of it. - Is it to be done today? - Yes, this evening. - Then consider it done. - First, listen to me. Don't worry. I've understood. Now begins the real show. But today... Raju, get aside... Hey, Raju I'm dead. Hey, Raju, what are you doing? Where will you take me Where will you take me, oh tormentor eyes? Where will you take me Sir's been waiting for you for a long time. It's my good luck, sir. But, where is that gun of yours today? I've come to apologize to you. I assent to your and Kamla's marriage. You said the same thing earlier. Forget the past, son. Today I've come to give you everything I own. My wealth, my property, my daughter... - and everything else in this world. - Hold on a moment. To start with, you must understand I only want your daughter. Not those chains. But I'm giving it of my own will. You don't want to give, but only to buy me. Raju! You want to make me your son-in-law? Me? - But I was... - Sorry, no human is sold here. Find some other shop. Your daughter will come to my house. - You mean here? - Yes, meaning here. In this house. But son, how can she live here? As we live. My wife won't be a doll, rich man. She'll live like a human being. Got it? Do you think my daughter... will she agree? You can ask her. Look. It's a quarter past three. She'll arrive at four. - Kamla? - Yes. Today she'll escape from the jail. Sunder! Hey, let's go. Let them come. Until she arrives, you're my guest. Raju! But remember... the moment she enters this house, Kamla is mine. And you'll have to step over my body to take her back. See, I can give you everything... but just leave this city. I'll give you whatever you ask. Here, take this check. Blank check. Look, I've already signed it. Fill in any amount you like. Raju, take all my wealth... but let my child go. For God's sake, let my daughter go. You couldn't kill me with the gun, sir. Now do you think you can kill me with money? Please have mercy on me. Kindly have mercy on this old man. If my daughter is destitute... what's the good of having this wealth. Will I carry this wealth to my grave? I promise... I shall keep your daughter like a flower. But what kind of love is this... that she, the poor child, leaving her luxuries... will sacrifice her life for you? And you? You won't even move from your principles a bit? - Raju... - You see, I love Kamla more than my own life. Before giving up what I think is right... I will choose death. No Bimla, today I want to go to him alone. All alone. So now my daughter... will leave me. Will leave me and live here! The ancestors of whom never even drank water by thermselves... will she wash dishes in your house? Will she wash your dirty clothes? Will she fetch water for your house? Impossible. I say, she won't bear it. For a month or two, maybe... but all her life? You cruel fellow, all her life? Sir, she is here. Dear, why do they stare at me? Have you informed the entire world? - Kamla, me... - No matter. Now I'm not afraid of the world. When you're with me, I'm not bothered about anyone. Oh! - Who brought these flowers? - Kamla, you go back. Your papa is right. Our marriage is impossible. And I'm sorry I couldn't understand it before now. Papa, came here? Yes. Raju, did you do anything to... No, it's not possible. Papa can't buy you. What is it, dear? Won't you tell me? - Don't know I can face death... - It's not matter of death, Kamla. It's matter of life. I know you can die for me. But can you live with me? Here? In this house? Not for a few days, for a few months, and even not for a year... but for all your life? You still don't trust me? Kamla, life doesn't always have a happy ending. Do you know what it means to live in this house? - I'll have to work... - Work? Such work that will break your back within a year. Such a work which... Come. Come with me. Look! For food, for clothes... for everything you need you have to toil hard. And you'll have to bake the bread. You'll have to wash piles of dishes. You'll to work like an animal. Water. You'll have to fight for water like cats and dogs. And when you finally get a pot or two... your back will be broken climbing stairs, madam! Look here. Your children. Grandchildren of your papa... will crawl like vermin in dirty drains. And possibly they'll drown in them, too. Within six months you'll be in such a condition... even your enemies will pity you. There won't be any doctor. Not even a native healer. And if you die, there'll be no one to mourn you. Also, you'll spend your entire life in these two rooms. Entire life. Millionaire's daughter! There'll be no car here. No radio here. Or any cinema here. What will be here, is work alone. Work, work, work! And you know what you'll get in return? Clothing and food. Food which your servants won't even eat. And the clothes, which you'll... You think I'll go back? Kamla! I know how difficult it will be. As I'm not used to working. - But, I'll learn. - No, Kamla! It can't be. This can't happen. It can't happen, because... Because I've sold myself. Look at this. It's a signed check. A blank check! I can fill in any amount I want, understand? I can take the entire wealth of your papa. So, now I have no right over you. No right whatsoever. Kamla. Come, let's go home. Raju, I don't know how to thank you. I hope now your daughter will live happily. But don't forget me on her marriage. But why are you returning this? Don't you really want anything? Yes, I do want. I want you to get out of here. Go immediately, rich man. Now I don't want to show my face to anyone. I was waiting for you, papa. Now you can marry me off to anyone you like. I am ready. Congratulations, uncle! Somehow the prestige of the family has been saved. One day you ancestors will look down upon me with pride. Perhaps you don't know that during my grandpa's times... if anyone even mentioned such a ridiculous thing... You're not my papa. You're my enemy. - But you can't separate us like this. - Shut up! If my mother were alive today... If my mother were alive today, would she do the same? Silence, Kamla. Silence. You aren't my papa, you're my enemy. You're not my papa, you're my enemy. I don't believe there's anyone in this world... who can't be purchased with money. You couldn't kill me with the gun, sir. How will you be able to kill me with money? - Enemy! - Enemy! Enemy, enemy, enemy! Sunder! Sunder, say it. Say it... that the young man has passed my test. Papa! - My child! - Papa! My child! The only question is, my child... will you be able to live happily with him? Hey, you're back? Look dear, I forgot to tell you something. Is anything left? I have brought everything. All the vegetables and other groceries you asked for. But, listen... I told you I won't go, won't go. After all, I'm the man of your house. Got it? Not your father's servant. Oof! I was saying something else. - Oh! You were saying something else? - Yes. Speak. Go, I won't say now. God! Hey, dear tormenting eyes! Where will you take me - Oh tormenting eyes - What childishness! So, why not say it? Not this way. It's something to be said privately. My youth is a fireball, my youth, my youth Whoever comes to destroy it, they will burn
