I do feel connected to the elements. When I'm out there, the rest just disappears. One thing that drives me and inspires me, is gravity. The mountains are, for me, one of life's most important things. It gives me so much energy, and a sense of life. There is a connection between the ocean and snow. I mean, ulltimately, it all comes down to water. I want to be a white paper and just set off from there. We should never forget yesterday, but, always, live for today. Because we never know what tomorrow might bring. I feel fortunate that I grew up in the Alps, and that I call these beautiful mountains home. I've learned a lot about myself and what I can do, through skiing. It has made me who I am and gotten me where I am, today. My life as a skier and film maker has taken me to beautiful places. But I simply love the feeling of coming home. It's here that I get to reflect on incredible journeys with friends. There's Janina, the crazy-fun "Kiwi". Carissa, a female surfing powerhouse. "Super Jules", the Olympic, racing queen. Matilda and Evelina, our Swedish chicks. And then, Nadine and I, the Austrian explorers. The start of each season is filled with production planning. Everyone has ideas of exciting trips we should do for filming. We all want to show each other our own backyards. But me, I was seriously fascinated by a 200-meter-high cinder cone... Mauna Kea, a volcano in Hawaii. This mystic mountain captivated me. I told Jules, who lives in Hawaii, about my idea to ski there. Even she thought I was crazy. "Hawaii?" Well, why not start my winter season on a tropical island? Maybe I'd even get a chance to talk to the snow goddess on Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea is a sacred mountain, and it's the highest point in Hawaii. It was glaciated during the Ice Age. It's name means: "White Mountain." Not often, but sometimes, it snows up there. I try to listen to Poli'ahu, the snow goddess of Mauna Kea. I'm asking myself... Will it ever be covered in snow? I felt extremely connected to the elements of nature up there. And I hope to ski that beautiful mountain one day. A mutual friend introduced me to Julia. Despite having the worst sushi at our first meeting, we're friends. It was easy to get Jules hooked on the idea of skiing Hawaii. She's never one to shy away from an adventure. Jumping is easy. Then you get in the ocean and the energy is... (WATER SPLASHING) (WAVES SPLASHING ON ROCK) Super Jules grew up in Squaw Valley and is USA's decorated female skier. Being able to go freeskiing, and competing on the World Cup tour, was really my biggest conflict. When I made the U.S. ski team, it was difficult finding time to live my passion for freeskiing, and enjoying the mountains. I love being a part of an all-girl film because I'm really passionate about inspiring girls. It's not just about the skiing, it's about living that lifestyle. When you think of Hawaii, you immediately think of surfing. While I was on the island I was able to see Carissa Moore. She was pumped to film with us. I grew up on the south shore of Oahu with my family. There's no greater place for surfing. It's great to be a part of a film project. Not having to wear a jersey or worry about time limits is great. Just being able to breath a little and express yourself more freely. (WAVES CRASHING) Surfing is a big part of my life. I wouldn't be the same without it. My office is the ocean and I'm doing something I love. (WAVES CRASHING) There is a connection between the ocean and snow. Ultimately, it comes down to water. There's a huge connection between a surfer and a skier. We're both riding waves. Skiers are riding a mountain wave, and I get to ride water waves. We both get to carve and create lines on these waves. (WAVES CRASHING) It was amazing to watch Carissa drawing her lines in the ocean. But it was time to get going. JULIA: Hi! - It's sad to see you go. - I had such an amazing time. I don't want to leave, and it's time for winter again. Be safe, I'll see you in Europe I'm really excited! It's Canada time. Hello! It felt good to see Evelina and Janina again. Even though we're spread out, it's always easy to reconnect. - Aw! It's good to see you. - How are you? - There was a big dump up there. - I'm so pumped to ski. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go! It was exciting to be back with them We were ready to go play. I meet people on the mountain who ski to get away from the city. It's because the mountains can bring that freedom, and joy, and fun. They bring you back to being a child. The Monashee Powder Lodge is located southwest of Revelstoke. It's accumulated annual snow is nearly 59 feet. (FEET CRUNCHING ON SNOW) - Woo hoo! - Yeah! - Woo! - Yeah! - Wow! - We're going! - How does the snow feel? - (LAUGHING) (COUNTING) One, two, three... - Okay, diving board. - Yeah! JANINA: I think it's so cool, grownups skiing, and being so passionate about life. EVELINA: For me, the most emotion, is, I guess, excitement. SANDRA: Evelina is the youngest of our group. She really pushes hard. You would not expect that from a little Swedish girl. (MACHINERY BEEPING) MEDIC: Just breathe. (CLOTHES RUSTLING) It kind of feels like I got all of the speed to that one foot. The impact... sort of... I don't know. (DOOR LATCH CLICKING) - Hi! - Wow! Look at that pillow stack! (LAUGHING) Amazing! - You made your own pillows. - Yeah, I did. SANDRA: You're going to rest tomorrow and then we'll see... - I feel confident with the crystals. - Yeah. I shouldn't have worried about Evelina. Our little warrior had her own method of dealing with the injury. SANDRA: A couple of days later, she was back with us. SANDRA: It's so cool that your ankle is feeling better. - I know! I'm so pumped for skiing. - I bet! JANINA: I feel like I can relate to Evelina and give her good advice. It shows in her skiing. On the last day, it was remarkable. SANDRA: It's fun to ski with Janina. You can feel the energy around us. JANINA: It's such a good feeling for the whole group. We can come together at the end of the day and say, "Whoa," that was a day that we can remember for a long time. SANDRA: I couldn't have asked for a better start. But my heart was ready to return home to the Alps. SANDRA: After a quick stop at home I headed to pick up Julia. Yes! (LAUGHS) Hello! (LAUGHS) JULIA: I never would have imagined, skiiing in the Alps in the middle of my World Cup season and being able to break away. Spending time with awesome girls and exploring the Alps in a new way. SANDRA: Engelberg Titlis, the largest ski resort in Switzerland has easily accessible all-pace runs. It's the home of many pro skiers like my friend, Mathilda Rappaport. - Hey, it's good to see you. - How was the long trip? It was long planes but an easy drive. SANDRA: Mathilda grew up in Stockholm. After university, she followed she followed her passion for skiing. I'm glad she moved to the Alps, as this is the place where we met. (LAUGHING) Mathilda was excited to show us around her angel mountain. Having Julia along with us was something special, since she only knew the Alps from her racing experience. Julia is a great personality to have in the crew, she's fun, she keeps the spirit high, and she's one of the best skiers. I've learned a lot about racing from skiiing with her. Her mindset and how she tackles a new situation is interesting. Since this isn't what she does daily, she appreciates it. MATHILDA: My hometown, Engelberg, to me, has the best skiing. I realize that this is my very biased opinion. Since I have a lot of friends there, I know the mountain very well. It's easy to know where to go and when to go. A powder day back home is hard to beat. JULIA: Freeskiing, to me, is where the sport started. Being able to go outside and explore and choose my own line, push myself how I want to be pushed and really just enjoy nature. Freeskiiing is just so different, no one's telling you how to move. You can really conquer the mountain. We do it as a team, encouraging one another, pushing ourselves on the run... but it's just complete freedom. Yeah! - Hey! - Yeah! SANDRA: Mathilda was always special to me, she encouraged me. She was an inspiring athlete and friend. She gave you the comfortable feeling of being seen and heard. MATHILDA: Sandra is the one I've skiied with the most throughout all of the Shades of Winter filming. What I've learned from her, is how to push and challenge myself. SANDRA: Mathilda knew every run in Engelberg. Following her through her home resort was challenging but so much fun. That's the kind of skiing we want, that's the best skiing in the Alps. MATHILDA: Sandra is an open and special person. We laugh a lot. Being around her is never boring. SANDRA: Throughout her career, Julia has faced physical injuries. But you don't know Jules if you think this kept her down. I needed surgery for hip pain I've been dealing with. (CELLPHONE DINGS) My life hasn't been too crazy lately. It's been a lot of rehab and keeping things controlled. Being able to get out to the mountains... I realize that's a big part of my life. I like the uncertainty and adrenaline from not knowing what comes next. SANDRA: Next up was a trip to Mathilda's homeland, Sweden. - Hey! It's good to see you! - Hey! - Hey! - Hi! (LAUGHS) MATHILDA: It's good to see you. - How was the flying? - It was long. - Coming from the other side? - It was good. I'm excited to ski! I think the coolest "between" moments are the relationships I've made, the moments when we get to have fun and not worry about performing. We can just enjoy where we are. I think what's special about Novasol is the long days. It's my home country, and it's cool to show it to the other athletes. We have great skiing here in Scandinavia. I've been working so hard and I can't believe I'm really here. Are you nervous to be back on skiis? Do you feel fine? I'm nervous to stand on the mountains and push myself. I'm just planning on going out and having a great time. Anytime we're together we have fun. I'm here to make smiles and memories. Well, we're happy to have you here. (LAUGHS) They didn't want me on the helicopter because of how I was walking. JULIA: This trip is special because I haven't been skiing. I've been pushing myself since having my surgeries. - Are you excited for skiing? - I'm so excited! - Are you nervous? - A little. - Woohoo! Let's do it! - Oh yeah! Welcome back to the crew. This is definitely the way to get back on skiis. No hiking, just the crew and a helicopter. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) MATHILDA: We were blown away by the scenery. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) MATHILDA: Flying out the first day, seeing all of these mountains for the first time with their challenging runs was a very special memoment for me. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (RADIO BEEPING) This is a warm-up run for me. I'm a little nervous. MATHILDA: You go where you feel good. I can't wait to see you skiing. Ten seconds for you, lady. JULIA: Here we go, have fun! I usually don't think about it, I let the adrenaline kick in and I don't get nervous. I'm where I'm supposed to be. In that moment everything's perfect. I was experiencing uncertainty when I stood at the peaks, so it was nice to be able to conquer my fears. It's the next step towards remembering the passion. Being away from the sport, I forgot how much I love it. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) - Beautiful! Good job! - Welcome back! - It feels good. Look at the light. - It's so amazing! (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Woohoo! Sweden! Yay! A really fun moment was when we tried to do ice fishing. (SNOWMOBILE ENGINE RUMBLING) (ICE CRUNCHING) GUIDE: Keep the lure moving all of the time. MATHILDA: I was enjoying it for about ten minutes and then I got bored, because I'm not patient. (LAUGHS) I love that we got to explore and see different cultures. We're gearing up to go to these beautiful mountains. I'm going to need that! I'm the lucky girl who get to ride in the chariot. SANDRA: At least you can ski better than you walk. It's going to be even better for your profile! (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) It was special to spot a wolverine. That does not happen often. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) I'm feeling okay, a little bruised. I'm getting some good lips. (LAUGHS) (EXHALES HEAVILY) I really look up to the other girls, seeing how confident they are and how cool they are. I get inspired every run. I'm super grateful for being here with you guys. This season has been a rollercoaster. Celebrating it with you is amazing. I can't believe the season went by so fast. I'm glad you came to Engelberg and got to ski my home mountain. Coming here to northern Sweden in May is cool. Especially skiing at 10:00 o'clock at night. It was incredible to see it in a different way, normally I'm racing and going crazy skiing in the Alps. It was cool to see the nature and be inspired by the freeskiing. Spend time with Sandra in Hawaii was cool, I want to show you more. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. Alright, so what's next? Well, don't you have a friend in New Zealand? Hello Sandra, it's Janina calling. It seems I missed you. Hopefully you and Mathilda can make it down this winter. We're having a record-breaking season, there's so much snow here. Give me a call back. I hope to hear from you soon. Bye. SANDRA: The life of a traveling skier is never glamorous. (LAUGHING) My skis won't budge. Revolving doors in airports are a ski bag's worst nightmare. Skiing in New Zealand has always been a dream of mine. It was easy leaving Europe and chasing winter to the south. Janina grew up all over the world, but has found a home in New Zealand. She has had 24 consecutive winters in 12 years. We're following the snow to both hemispheres. (KNOCKING) Oh my God! It's so good to see you! I can't believe you're here. I'm ready to explore New Zealand. We've been talking about it forever. I've skied with Janina in many places but being here is special. Wanaka is a cool place to explore. There's never a down day here. You don't wait for clear weather. I wouldn't call it down day, I would just say activity day. (BOAT ENGINE REVS) - Yeah! - Crazy! This is all Lake Wanaka. Over there you can see Lake Hawea. That's a seperate lake, which is really cool. Oh, it's beautiful. Everything is so grounded. Hey ladies, what are you up to? Driving back to the helipad. Welcome back! To be around with Matilda. She's the group's sweetheart. I've been on some trips with her I haven't talked to her for a time and it's like just like I saw her. I think that's a huge thing with the girls that we travel with, In between travelling, if there is that strong friendship... I think that's what makes it work with the group. We're able to charge and trust each other and make ourselves better skier from feeding off each other. Happy skiing! The hut was such a unique place for us to stay. It was cool finding out it was love for the mountains that made them build this little biwak to share with other people. (WOMEN LAUGHING) Waking up in the Southern Alps, is really hard to beat. New Zealand showed the girls my style of skiing and it can be really playful but it can also be gnarly. They really got to capture me in that little nutshell. Where does everyone want to ski? WOMAN ON RADIO: [Tell us when you're good to go.] Yes, Mathilda is going to drop first. [WOMAN ON RADIO:] [3... 2... 1, dropping.] Mathilda! Why don't we ask the pilot to land in my front yard back home in town. - Seriously? - Let's see if it would happen And then we really did it. We landed the helicopter right in front of Janina's house! Her dad was almost crying as he was so stoked with us... or because he worried about his crazy daughter. Woohoo! (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Woohoo! After an exciting trip like that, I need some calm time for myself to reflect and to mentally arrive back home. It's important that every day is not a rush. It was a new season and we had two highlights left. One we've been chasing for years, Nadine Wallner's project. Nadine is a talented and ambitious young Austrian athlete. She was the youngest athlete to win the Freeride World Tour 2 times in a row before a really gnarly injury took her down for 2 years. NADINE: The mountains took me away from the mountain. It was just a fight back. the time I got to reflect what happened the last years, where I am and what I am. I think it was worth it to rest for 2 years, and now I am back and I can enjoy it much more now. I got a lot of emotional moments when I was on a peak again and I was able to go up and down. My dad showed me Zermatt and the Matterhorn when I was a child and from that on I knew I wanna climb this mountain. How everything came in my life with skiing, I saw that it's ski-able. So I wanted to ski it. Nadine called and said, "hey Theresa, I need a partner to ski it I thought about it for half a minute and then I said yes. I knew immediately that It would be amazing to do it. Theresa has pretty good skills on the mountain it's always good to have a good teamwork on the mountain I knew it would work with her. Yeah we are going to climb it, and then ski it. Hopefully the weather forecast is right. The clouds are moving, and it's clearing up. The more I look at it the more I wanna ski it. We are waiting so long for it. - Hope for the best. - It's gonna be fine. NADINE: We slept at Hörnli hut and did and early start. (BOOT CRUNCHING ON SNOW) (EXHALES LOUDLY) SANDRA: It wasn't meant to be for Nadine and Theresa. It was mother nature's call. What counts is that they are safe. I was struggling with myself because I have been here 3 times. I was so close. I was fighting against myself. I knew that I shouldn't go up there because it's too warm. It was horrible to recognize that my theory doesn't work. I was kind of helpless. I wanted to cry. Sometimes you have to go to a place many times. This mountain, it's gonna be here forever. One of the things I learned when I was injured is being patient. Patience is a virtue that we all have to deal with. That's just part of being an athlete. Set a goal, succeed or fail and set new ones. It was then, out of the blue that I got a message from Julia. It's on. I am flying to Hawaii to ski. It seems the snow goddess of Mauna Kea wanted us to ski. It had finally been snowing in Hawaii. But it still felt crazy to hike with skis on the tropical island. Standing on top I remember looking over at, Maui where I live thinking nobody would ever imagine that they could ski here, no one could dream about it. To have that experience just goes to prove that the passion of skiing, and all those dreams have been an incredible journey. SANDRA: It was satisfying to complete the goal of skiing Mauna Kea. It was magical. It seems crazy that it would make us so excited to ski this peak. It was one of the most emotional moments of my skiing. - Yay! We did it. - We skiied in Hawaii. Skiing Mauna Kea is a dream come true and we did it! The Hawaiian islands are a very special place. Especially Mauna Kea, it's a spectacular mountain, it's of the tallest in the world. On occasion it snows up there. It's crazy seeing snow in Hawaii. - Hi Sandra, how are you? - It's good to see you. - Are you ready? - I'm ready to go surfing! Let's go surfing! I am really proud to be Hawaiian. There is so much power in the ocean and it's empowering to paddle out and conquer a wave. Riding a wave all the way to the beach, doing a new maneuver, that gives a lot of confidence and a lot of energy to a person. It's really cool to have all of my achievements in one room but at the same time they're just things they are just symbolism of an achievement. It's the moments getting cheered up at the beach that I remember. I'm lucky to call this valley home, and to be surrounded nature. Pure serenity, it's my happy place. We should never forget yesterday, but always live for today Because we never know what tomorrow might bring. (WAVES CRASHES ON ROCK) Alaska is such a special place. I always have a hard time picturing myself skiing those mountains, but then I remember that I love the challenge of skiing here. Skiing in Alaska forces you to be completely present. There's no room for distraction when when you're standing on those peaks. I haven't done anything this forward before, I'm scared. Skiing in Alaska is conquering your fears. So you really need to learn to trust yourself. It's breathing and getting over that fear. 15 seconds. All right. Janina dropping in ten. [WOMAN SPEAKING ON RADIO] [(INDISTINCT CHATTER)] - Now? - In ten. [(COUNTING)] [5... 4... 3... 2... 1!] And also really just... being up there and talking to yourself like: "alright, I've done this, and I can do this again." Everything is gonna be ok. I have so much respect for those mountains. When standing on the top of my line all I do is focus on being present. I take the time to appreciate the moment. I exhale deeply and look straight before I drop in. (CHEERING) there is a long process that leads to dropping in to an Alaska line. I see it as kind of a tunnel that becomes more and more narrow. In the beginning there is uncertainty. What will the snow be like? Where are safe spots? Where do I exit? All these thoughts. But then the closer I get, the less uncertanties I have. Instead I gain more confidence. At the top of a line I want focus on what I am doing. That's the end of the tunnel. I want to be a white paper and set off from there. Our paths intertwine throughout life. Sport helps bring us together. We've built a friendship. Never to be forgotten.
