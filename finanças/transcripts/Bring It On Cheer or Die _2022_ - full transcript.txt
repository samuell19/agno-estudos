Now, put your hands together for the Green Knights! Their flyer looks like a sloppy noodle on that pyramid dismount. Sandra, wolf wall then full pyramid. You're flying. Think you can pull it off without sucking? But we rarely practiced. Your cheer captain asked you a question. You can break your loser neck for all I care, as long as you stick that landing. Got it? Thanks. Hey. Don't let her get to you. You're here because you deserve to be. Just remember when you get up there, don't look down. Eyes on the prize, straight ahead. Thank you. You've got this. Next up, the reigning cheer national champions, the Elk Moore Diablos! All right. Okay, gather around. Everyone here? Okay, Diablos on three. One, two... Diablos! Do it like this. What the hell, Sandra? Abby, you're late! Okay, getting in the car, gotta go. Diablos, Diablos, take that ball. Take that ball away and score! Shake that ass Satan! Bite me, woo! Another touchdown for the Green Knights. Would you look at those bitches stunt? We could flash just as high if we were allowed to do more than a Zumba routine. The Green Knights are pretty bad ass. Their uniforms are so shiny like Christmas. But they don't have to hold a bake sale car wash raffle-at hon to pay for them. Or practice on the wrestling team's used mats. They smell like sadness. That smell haunts my dreams. We're just as good as they are. They just... have more money. And we'd kick their freaking asses too if we could stunt. The extra point is good, and the Green Knights extend their lead at half time. Diablos zero, Green Knights 41. Tori, skirt, now. Like, could she be any more star for attention? We'll all get further if we treat each other with respect. Oh, please don't get all "High School Musical." Thirsty Stan incoming. Blink twice if you need help. Shush. Hey, I was wondering if you could talk after the game. There was something I was wondering... Spencer, get your ass in the locker room, now. Wish me luck. Don't even. I'm not. But still, he's cute. Yeah, not cute enough. Plus, you promised you weren't gonna get back together with him. Did I? Yes, may I remind you he made out with a freshman. - It was a little kiss. - She had baby bangs. Okay, I have bangs. So what, he just confused you two? Come on, guys like Scott, they always cheat. It's a really crappy design feature. Dually noted. Good. Paparazzi at 12 o'clock. Now he on the other hand actually is cute. Evan? We were friends back in elementary, end of story. Mm-hmm, sure. Why not? - Because. - He's hot. In an emo creeper kind of way. Like sexy Unabomber. - Tori. - I'd do him. Oh, we know, we know. Oh, come on. Don't be such a prude. There's nothing wrong with exploring the miracle of our bodies. So long as it's on our terms. Well, I thank you for that advice, but I don't remember asking for it. Is she for real? Yeah, she is for real. What the hell? Sidelines are off limits, freshie. Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, you think she's okay? Evee is upset that I'm on the cheer squad when she's not. I didn't know she wanted be a cheerleader. Why didn't she try out? We decided that we should try different things. We can't be joined at the hip forever, right? I think this is the perfect year to try new things. I wish I was their mascot. Okay, team meeting. Abbs, get over here. Okay you guys, listen up. It's time to show them whose field this is. Straight up liberty, just like we practiced. Mckayla, you know we can't. Otherwise the school is gonna know we've been secretly working on our stunts. Okay, so we'll chance it. No way we're just flipping pom poms here like we're in the Glee club. You want me to fly now? Like, right now? Yeah. Why can't Abby do it? Acrophobia. You're afraid of acrobats? I'm afraid of heights. Yeah, like that's a thing. Okay guys, listen up. Reagan, you're gonna be great. Stu, Jackie, Quincy, you guys are basing. Wait, where the hell is Quincy? Oh my God. What's up? No. Okay, Paige and Mateo, you guys are doing round offs off your front. Everybody else is spotting, okay? Okay. Diablos on three. One, two, Diablos! Come on Diablos, let's go! Diablos! Well, isn't this a pickle. Principal Simmons, I can explain. Ms. Miller, you had one rule and one rule only. It's not our fault. The Green Knights were kicking our ass. You broke by trust. Reagan could have been seriously injured. Football players get injured all the time. Football players are athletes, big difference. Athletes train. Athletes know how to not injure themselves. Cheerleaders don't. If anyone should understand anything about that, I would think it would be you Abby. What? Don't think I'm not aware of your little plan. Recruiting my daughter into your club, just to curry a favor for me. Not at all, Paige, she... I wasn't born yesterday. For Paige's sake and Paige's sake only, I will not disband the Diablo cheer squad, but here's the deal. There will be no jumping, no lifts, no flips, no whatever it is you people do. One foot on the ground at all times. Do I make myself clear? What about regionals? They're in two weeks. Principal Simmons, please. There's already a no stunt rule in place. Our routine is... Sucking! Listen, just be grateful I'm letting you compete. But if there is so much as a single somersault on school property, I will cancel the cheer squad for the next 50 years. I mean, did you see the look on Simmons' face? You mean this? Yeah, do that long enough it's gonna stick. It's too late for her. Anyway, it could have been way worse. She could have banned this regionals all together. You know, Simmons is not gonna be at the actual competition. Yeah, so? So she said no practicing stunts on school property. Wait, are you saying? Oh, you sneaky B. That cheerleader choreographed his fire. Now we just need somewhere else to practice. Yeah. All right dill holes, here's the cheer facts. This school gives zero shits about our squad, but that's gonna end now. Wait, we're still going to regionals? - Mm-hmm. - Yep. There's there's no time to nail our rogue routine. Look, team, this isn't gonna be easy. We don't have any funding and we barely have enough people to make a full squad, but that's not what cheer is about. We're more than just a social club. We're athletes. We've got stunts. We've got moves and we've got style and we are gonna show them that we're the real deal. And I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna say anything. Right, Paige? Good. We just need to practice away from the school, and I'm not talking just practice. We need a 24 hour cram sesh this weekend. Oh, but this weekend is Halloween and I have a dope costume picked out. Tori, it's okay. You can be a slutty Jigsaw next year. Okay guys, this weekend we eat, breathe and sleep Diablo cheer leading. Okay, but where? I know, my house is big. And bonus, we have two hot tubs now. Sharing with my brother was so gross, like ass soup gross. Okay, but mcmansion isn't big enough for us to go full out. Our baskets need 20 feet at least. Wait, what? I'm going up 20 feet? What about the old abandoned school on the other side of town? You mean the old Elk Moore High School? Yeah, where our high school used to be before they built this one. It had lead pipes or something. They closed it because of the pestos. I think you mean asbestos. The school board uses it for storage. I think I can get the key. Seriously? Way to impress, new. Okay wait, so how are we going to get there? Oh, my dad owns a bus company. I'll see if I can get us a bus. Really? He's cheating on my mom with my sister's nanny. He'll do anything I want, as long as I don't tell. It's pretty sweet. All right, we have a plan. Bring your sleeping bags and plenty of food and water. We'll make a small party out of it. Yeah, but we're gonna go hard. It's gonna be 24 hours of straight cheer. If you're not in it, we won't win it. Straight from hell, never take an I. Who are we? Diablo cheer! Louder! Diablo cheer! Give a sec, Dan. Bye. Hey, Abbs. We didn't get to talk after the game the other night. Nope. Need a ride home? I drove. I've gotta go. Hey, wait. Abbs. You were the best thing to ever happen to me, okay. It shouldn't have ended like that and I want to make it up to you. Scott... What are you doing tomorrow? You have any plans for Halloween? We have practice. It's Evan, isn't it? I've seen the way he looks at you like he's some slenderman stalker. Damn it, Evan! You're not getting back together with Scott, are you? You scared the crap out of me just to say that? What's wrong with you? Well, he's an asshole, Abby. And do you know that how? People tell me things. Like who? Nobody tells you anything because everyone's freaked out by you. Yeah, well at least I'm not living my mom's dream. Look, I'm sorry. That was mean, I... No, no, it's okay. I'm sorry too. If you ever wanted to talk to someone who isn't a meat head. Yeah, I know where you live. Okay. Mm-hmm. Just a minute. Look guys, it's the bus I was telling you about. And it even comes with the driver. Actually, I think he lives in it. Is that thing road legal? Mostly. I thought you said your dad owned a bus company. He owns an impound yard. Therefore he owns this bus, pending a court order. Woot woot, all aboard! County Mckayla, we're missing three people. What did you expect, it's Hallo-weekend. Do you think Mckayla bailed? No way. This is so weird, she's never late. Maybe we should give her another five. Okay guys. As co-captain of this squad, I am making a decision. We leave now. Everyone who isn't on the bus can meet us there. Andale Diablos. I guess let's go. What time are you picking us up tomorrow? We've got a gig tonight. Done by four, here by five. After that, I'm dead to the world. Perfect. Sorry. It's fine. Hey, is it true Silent Stu never speaks? All I know is that he used to cheer for the Green Knights, but then he got expelled. Something about a cartel. He hasn't said a single word since. Oh, that's why we call him Silent Stu. Oh sweetie. My mom calls cell phones our generation's opium. Definitely a problem. All right team. The next 24 hours are all about some serious cheer. No distractions, no posts, no pictures. You've got 30 minutes to check your Instagram, TikTok, whatever else you're into. But when we get off this bus, cell phone's off and into the sack. Guys, it's one day. This weekend is life or death for Diablo cheer. By the time we're done, we're gonna have a routine that's gonna make the Green Knights pray for death. A dark speech, go Capitano. Abby, I need to be exempt from this no cell phone policy. What if there's an emergency? Like a sexting emergency. I'm sure Danny can go one day without getting your taco emoji Tori. What are you talking about? Aren't you guys hooking up? You're being so presumptuous. I'm saving myself for marriage. I'm serious. I mean, but Danny's cute. We both like tacos so maybe I'll marry him. Oh, he likes tacos all right. Oh gosh, he responded so quick. He must like eggplants too. Are you being serious? This is the beginning of Diablo cheer camp. We're gonna work like hell, kick some butt, you know, practice until we draw. That was kind of cute. You're like a Kirkland Signature brand Mckayla. Only Kirkland brand is good. All right everyone, phones in the bag. Pick up your gear and let's get inside. Tori. Huh? Just release, thank you. Hey. Breathe, you're doing great. I'm gonna vomit I am so nervous. I can barely remember the routine. If Mckayla doesn't show, I don't know what I'm gonna do. You've got this. Are we practicing in the dark? Because I'm a little scared of the dark. Of course you are. Oh geez. Looks like a trade school for future serial killers. Oh, over here. You know, one winter, we were at our cabin up in Maine and all the electricity went out for a whole day. It was so cold that my daddy lit a fire and the housekeeper had to sleep in the main house with us. Yeah, she persisted. Stu. Maybe we can sell these at our next raffle. Yeah, first we cheer and then we mow. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived. Okay, this place is dirt nasty. Yeah, but I'd take a little dust over Principal Simmons any day. So do we hold a seance first, or do we go straight to the exorcism? So this is where school furniture comes to die. Lets clear a space and get the mats down, warm up and then go from there. Ooh, co-captain finally has a plan. Abby's our captain, at least until Mckayla gets here. Look guys, for the first time in years, we have a shot at showing everyone who the goat is, but we have to focus and work together. We're gonna add stunts, aerials, and we're gonna end with our grand finale, hitch pyramid. Like we've ever managed to pull that one off. Reagan, you're our best flyer. Are you ready? Yeah. Yeah, of course I am. Okay. Well, what about music? You've got our phones, remember? I do. Quincy, the boom box please. Quincy, music. If music be the food of love... I need that. All right then. What is that thing? I think I heard the elders speak of these. I don't know how it works though. Bright light, bright light! Crunch time, Diablos. Five, six, seven, eight. Let's go back. Yeah, I've got it. My ankle. Reagan, are you okay? Yeah, it's probably just a twist. Okay everyone, good job. Water break and then we run in again in five. Okay, come on. Yeah, just there. Wow, Abby's straight flexing. Yeah, she is. We're lucky to have her. Cheer wasn't even a thing at this school before Abby and Mckayla came and brought it back their freshman year. They had to fight to get it too. Just think, if it wasn't for cheer, I'd still be in the drama club. That's so cool, I didn't know that. Way to go co-captain. Diablos are legacy. I couldn't just let it die. Yeah, Elk Moore cheer was straight fire back then. Okay, so if the old squad kicked so much ass, why would they kill the cheer program? Oh, oh, I know this story. A cheerleader died in the middle of regionals. She was doing this big stunt and then something happened. It was a really bad accident. She broke her neck and her head fell off. That's stupid, heads don't fall off when you break your neck. No, but it was a really bad accident. They canceled the cheer program the next day. Great. Who's ready to get airborne? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. I mean, I'm sure it's just some sort of sprain, right? - Um. - Oh. Paige, get her a chair. She needs to elevate her foot. Sydney, get the phones. Abbs, where's the phone bag? It's there, just keep looking. You know what, this is silly. I probably just need to put pressure on it. - What? - And walk around. Will someone give me an ice pack? Where's the cooler? Oh, on it. No ice. What? Wait, was I supposed to bring ice? Duh. What is the point of a cooler without ice? Details, man. Tori, can you see if there's ice packs anywhere in this place? Maybe the nurse's office? - Yeah. - Okay, thank you. I so sorry, I'll be quick. Abbs, it isn't here. Did you leave it on the bus? No way, I brought everything in. Hey, we should totally call the bus driver and check. We have no phones. Obviously. A quick break while we figure this out. Grab a snack and then hopefully Tori will find some ice and we can get back to work. Okay? Zingo, bitch. Ugh, boohoo. Uh, hello? Who's there? God, you scared me. What are you doing here? Dude, you're creeping me out. It's my cooling towel, it's the best I could find. Thank you. Okay, I have to pee. Is no one coming with? Are you being serious? We always have bathroom buddies. Am I right girls? Fine. I'll go by myself. I'm sure you'll live. Are we still on break? Yeah. I'm gonna get some air. Hey, just make sure it's none of that funny air. Aye Quince? If only someone hadn't taken our phones... Even if we did have them, it's not like we could use them to call for help. The police would come and arrest us and our parents would be pissed. Especially if they search Quincy's bag. Why would we get arrested? I mean, we are breaking and entering. But we had a key. Technically it's just entering. Technically it's trespassing. Don't worry, if it all goes down, at least we go down together. Hey, thanks for keeping me waiting. It's all here, but I want to be there for Abby's moment of truth. Here you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. Paige, are you okay? I guess. This is all my fault, isn't it? No way, you came through for us and got us the key. This is on me, I'm not cut out for this captain grab. That's not true. What you had us doing before Reagan got hurt was pretty great. Wanna prank Tori? Aren't we like, back from break? Sydney's still in the washroom. Silent Stu just busted open a bento box. He's counting his juice. We've got time. Right, okay, let's do it. Back in five. I guess I should get some air too. Okay. Do you think Tori is actually a Virgin? She totally is. She's in my sister's youth group. They took an oath for Jesus. Okay, well does Danny know? 'Cause he's been practically dry humping the walls every time she walks by. Tori. Oh my God, that is so creepy. Tori. If this is a "Saw" thing, I'm totally not cutting off my leg. Mateo, this isn't funny! It really hurts. Hey, where are we? How do I know, I was following you. I was following you. Ugh. Hello? Cheer buddies? Hey. That's a killer bong, dude. Not cool. Man. Hey, is that Quincy? What's he doing? That's why we don't have to stunt, Quincy. He's definitely broken. Oh my God, is that Tori, you think? What a dog. Ew, is he making out with the door? That or Tori is working her magic. Okay, TMI. Ooh, let's head back. I need brain bleach. Yo, so you're turning left at the next street. Uh, where are we going? Please tell me we're not going to Abby's. We're not going to Abby's. Scott, you've gotta stop with the stalker vibes, dude. You're starting to make it weird. Did I say we're going to Abby's? Unless you want to go to Abby's. Oh no, Abby's your fixation dude, not mine. Okay chief. Ooh, now Victoria, on the other hand. Look at this text she sent me. Right, so into you. Dammit, got a charger somewhere? - Nope, sorry. - My phone just died. Hey yo, dude, where are we going? We're going to McKayla's. I forgot, but Abby wanted me to go check up on her. Dude. Atta boy, yes. You're like a lion, man. I'm not... Rebound that shit, be proud. Say it, I'm rebounding it. That's not what I'm doing. I'm rebounding it. Five, six, seven, eight. Knee, stronger, half T, V, clean. Guys, that's never gonna beat the Green Knights. Okay, let's do it again. Five, six, seven, eight. Knee, X, half T, V, clean. Okay, so in case anyone cares, Quincy's so high he's making out with a glass door. That or he is getting down with Tori. So no ice for Reagan, I guess. It's all right, I'll just start stretching it out. Okay guys, the bus picks us up at 5:00 AM sharp. We're running on a time to get it together, so let's up our game. Basket toss. Uh, how? We barely have enough people to toss it. We only need four. Paige flies, Jackie and Stu base, and Mateo back spots. Aye aye, co-captain. We're on it. - Thank you. Let's go, Paige. Ready? Can I start with a lift? Okay, let's do lifts. Okay. All right, set up. Okay, you ready? - Yeah. - Yep. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Yes, Paige. - Good job! Good Job. Now the toss. You've got it. Um, just hold. Are you okay? Sorry. Jackie, are you okay? That was a mess. Okay guys, let's take 10. Okay? Jackie, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm just going to the bathroom. Um, guys. I'm sorry guys, it's my fault. I'm not ready to fly, no way. No, it's not your fault freshie. We could have spotted you better. Hey guys. What is it? Look at this. The ultimate cheer competition. Did you make this? Of course I didn't make that. I just found it by the bags. Is this supposed to be us? I mean, klutzy nerd, that's... Why? Because I take AP English? You know what, you're a complete blatherskite. Pardon me? In terms you may understand, hashtag screw you. Guys, stop it. I heard the football team did this once. Points for whoever sleeps with certain cheerleaders or whatever. It's a sex list? I don't want to sleep with anyone. Like ever? Jackie? Is she knocked out? It looks like it. Did she slip? Yeah, right after she got stuck in a bear trap. Why is there even a bear trap in here? Hey guys, I think I found our phones. Ew, I am so not touching that. Did anyone bring any rice? Help me turn her over. Slowly. #Cheers lay does not mean sex. What? The list, somebody is trying to kill us. - This is so messed up. - We have to get out of here! Everyone, grab your things and follow me. Wait, what about Tori and Quincy? We'll catch them on the way out. Come on, let's go! I know a door that's close! He chained this door. Oh my God, we're so dead. Let's go to the front door. I can't believe someone's trying to kill us. I know, it's that creepy guy that's always eye groping Abby. Evan, his name is Evan and he does have serious stalker vibes. What if it's the ghost to the dead cheerleader? Since when do ghosts chain up doors? No!, Oh my God, were the chains on sale? We're all gonna die. Zip it Paige, we're not gonna die. What are we gonna do Abby? Back to the gym. At least in there, we can see if anyone's coming at us. Wait. Abby, wait. If Sydney is the ditz, and the ditz is dead, then who's next? - Stoner. - Quincy. Slut. Tori. Well, sort of. This better not be based on looks. Stoner, slut and basic bitch all have check marks by them. Dang. They're the targets and we have to find them before the killer does. Mckayla! Hey, you in there? You home? Well, not here, let's go. Hey, wait. Trick or treat. Sorry little dudes, no one's home. And they didn't leave any candy out? Candy hoarders. Hey, where's your head? Can you guys just like, bug off? All right, come on back. Yo, where are you going? Maybe they already left. Or maybe they're already dead. We should split up and look for them. Oh hell no, that's how you get killed in horror movies. Unless the killer's one of us. Whoa, dude. Okay, he's been with us this this entire time. What about you Mateo? You've been in and out of this gym. Stop it. We're not gonna point fingers at each other. It doesn't help. What we need to do is find the rest of the team and find a way out of this place, together. Copy? Reagan should stay here, she can barely walk. Right. Jackie, stay with Reagan. Mateo, Paige, and Stu, you come with me. If we get separated, everyone meet back here. Put 'em in. Diablos on three. One, two, Diablos. That's her bedroom. Bro, why do you know where her bedroom is? Abby told me. Yeah, I'm sure she told you where all of her friend's bedroom windows are, 'cause that's totally normal. Hey yo, stop being such a creep. If they're not here, let's go. Can you just be quiet? Elk Moore High School. Okay, so what, they're at school? No, not our school, dude. It has to be the old Elk Moore High School. No, no, no, no, no. Dude, that place has salmonella. We're not gonna go there. It literally oozes out of the walls, man. Well take a Pepto, let's go. A Pepto? I swear if she's there with him, I'm gonna kill him. Hey, dude, you said if the girls weren't here it's party time. Abby. What should we do if we see someone? Do we attack or do we get all tough? Like, freeze! It depends on the situation. So maybe we make a scale. Like an unarmed girl scout is a one. And an ax wielding madman is a 10. So if you call 10, that's run from an ax. And level one could be beat the shit out of that girl scout. I don't know what a girl scout with an ax would be though. There'd be a six. Tori. - Tori! - Where is she? Where are you? Do you think Tori is in there? I guess we're gonna find out. I'm scared, Abby. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Is it okay, is it really? We're all scared, but we have to remember that none of us is alone. We have each other. We have to trust each other and know we have each other's backs no matter what. That's what cheer is all about. Can you trust us to keep you safe? Yeah. Good. Okay, here we go. Worst spirit fingers ever. Don't touch that. Are we ready? Does it matter? I call a 10. We need to find Quincy! I bet he's dead too! He's alive, he has to be. This way! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh a 10, right, that's definitely a 10. He better be here to cheer. Everybody run! You know, if I am the klutzy nerd, I don't see why I'm only worth five points. I mean, you're worth eight. Wait, which one am I? The jock. Well, unless you're a badass, and that's worth 12. You think? I mean, maybe you're the klutzy nerd. But you could also be the sexy blonde. That's worth 10 points. Yeah. Hey, hey! What? See, see, Evan slenderman's car. Okay, so what? I knew it, I knew it. Hey, easy. - I'm gonna kill him. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna kill him. - Hey, hey. The ladies are waiting man, come on. No dice. Wait, hold up. Is that a crowbar? A boy scout's always prepared. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking less boy scout, more Ted Bundy on that one. Whatever. You need some help? No. After you. Bro. Is this really the look you're going for? Better? Marginally. Okay. I'm going up, dude. Okay. Help! Did you hear that? Hear what? It's Abby. Where? Help! See, you hear that? If this is what love is, I want no part of it. Okay? - Come on. What are you, telapathetic or something? Let's go! Okay. - This way. - Okay. Quincy! Quincy, wake up! Hey Abbs. Oh my God. Hey. I'm so sorry, this is all my fault. This isn't you. Our souls are like drops of water and we return to the ocean. I see everything. Almost. Can you reach into my pocket? Too late. Bummer. Oh, Quincy, Quincy? I'm sorry. Hey, I think we lost him! Stu, Paige? Oh, what are you gonna do now Hawkeye? Dang, I did not see that coming. Hey yo, bathroom. Okay, I gotta go freshen up and gotta take a leak. There's a lot going on in my body. Yeah, but it takes forever in that costume. Okay, well one second, okay bro? One second, bro. As if. Help! Abby? Does this go outside? Abby? Scott? Abby? Scott! Abby? Scott! Scott! Scott? Mckayla? Abby, listen. I can explain. You asshole. Hey, it's not what it looks like. Okay? Mckayla and I, Abby, just... - Scott! Get outta here! Run! Go! Who are you, huh? Is that you Evan? You creepy mother... Scott? Scott? Scotty? Scotty? Oh, time to get laid. Woo! Danny? Whoa, hey, Mateo. Danny! Where's your phone? It's dead, dude. Why are you so hectic? It's Tori, she's dead. Dude, we were literally texting this morning. That's a cool trick. Ow! There's a psycho killer on the loose and they got her. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Dude, I get it. You can drop the skit. It's Halloween, ooh, ah! Seriously though dude, where is she? Okay, tonight is the night that we consummate our love. Dude, it's not happening. Right, yeah, 'cause she's dead. Bro, I swear she is! Yeah, okay. You know she was a Virgin, right? What? Like zero penises? None. No. No, that's impossible. Dude, she literally texted me tacos. Tacos. Sorry. That's just not fair. Not fair at all, dude. Okay, who is that? Dude, does it look bad? Stu you're back, where's Abby and Mateo? Tori and Quincy are dead. Oh my God! Danny is dead. Abby, you're alive! Mateo, you're bleeding. It's the devil mascot. He shot me with his arrow. I'm dying. You're not gonna die. Here, let me see. I'm just gonna... - Count until the warning! Count down before you amputate my arm. Just breathe, breathe. Super absorbent and with wings. Good job, Jackie. Help! Who are you? Evan, is that you? Abby, I think I know who it is. Paige, what are you doing? Anyone move and I'll kill her. No! Evee? Sorry about your boyfriend. But face it, he was just a cheating jock. 10 points for me. No points for dead slenderman though. You killed Evan? Poor Evan, trying so hard to relive your elementary school years. You know, it was his idea to film El Jocko there screwing around with your BFF. That has to sting. Screw you. Counting the Mckayla kill, I'm still winning. You don't get full points for Mckayla. We did that one together. Mckayla? Paige, let her go. You don't get to call the shots. We're in charge now, and I say we split that kill. All you were supposed to do was ring the doorbell. I didn't need your help. You wish, four points each. No points for Scott. He's a jock, 10 points. No substitutions. Paige, you're one of us. One of you? Don't flatter yourself. I can't believe that dumb cheerleader stereotype is actually true. Paige, please. Let's get them! Everyone, on the steps, now. Let's just do what they say. Please don't do this Paige! Okay. Story time, boys and girls. 20 years ago, there was a very talented cheerleader. All the other cheerleaders wanted to be just like her. So one day at regionals, her team sabotaged her. Woo, Sandra! She fell from the top of the pyramid and snapped her neck. Her twin sister watched her die. She never got over it and she never forgave. So when she had twin daughters of her own... Your auntie Sandra will be avenged. Say it. Auntie Sandra will be avenged. She trained us. Your fishing trips. Survivalist training camps, thank you very much. We learned it all. Hunting, trapping, killing. Every damned weekend. You cheerleaders walk around with your nose jobs in the air like you're gifts to this school. Wait, you're doing all this because you hate cheerleaders? Not just cheerleaders, that cheerleader. Your mom was cheer captain of the Diablos. She was so jealous of our Auntie Sandra, she killed her rather than letting her shine. I know what she did and I am sorry. I've done everything I can not to be anything like her. So you're telling me, Abby's mom killed your aunt? And so Principal Simmons outlawed stunts and groomed you two into psychos? Auntie Sandra will be avenged. The Diablos have to die. So when do we start the game? What are you talking about? You guys like cheering for games, so we came up with a little game of our own. It's called... Cheer or die. Here's the rules. Cheer, perfect form, or die. It's simple. Now get your ass up there, jock. Jackie, see, I was right. You are the jock. Wait, if Jackie's a jock... Oh my God, am I the sexy blonde? Am I right? Wait, how is the badass worth more points than I am? Jackie, you're up. Kick, kick, split, fish, blop. How do you even do that altogether? Jackie, I've seen you do all those things. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie! Yes Jackie! Mateo, you're up. Let's see a back handspring step out. Can I have a running start? From standing. Hello, I'm injured. Boohoo. Mateo, you can do it. Just concentrate. Mateo, Mateo, Mateo. Everybody shut up! Back handspring back tuck. Look out! Bravo, badass. Who's next? I say it's the klutzy nerd. You're up! Round off back walkover. What? I'll go. Reagan is injured. Round off, back walkover. Oh, come on. I thought you two were smarter than that. I mean, you still need a hostage, right? Nice try, final girl. Wait, maybe she's right. These assholes need a little skin in the game. My mouth! You're done hurting any of us, you got that? No points for you! Reagan! Let's cheer, bitch. Mateo, back handspring. Back kick! Stu, toe touch. Diablos, we're outta here. Paige? Shit, we're still trapped. There's another way, come on. - Why are we going up here? - There's a courtyard upstairs. Maybe it's the way out. Here it is! Crap, it's a dead end! We can get on the roof. How? Straight up toss. Abbs, we suck at those. Guys, it's the only way. How's your ankle? I can't put enough pressure on it. Abby. You have to do it. Come on. I can't. Please, please. It's too high and I can't, I can't. You can. Come on Abbs. You are our captain. We believe in you like you believe in us. You can do this. You're gonna fly, captain. You've got this, Abbs. Okay, right, I've got this. - Okay. - Okay. On five. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Yes! Go Abby, go! Yes, keep going! I'm good! Oh God, there's a rope. At least something is going right. Here you go. I got it. I got it. Okay, come on. Be careful, careful of the foot. Careful, come on Reagan. All right, come on Jackie. Come on Jackie. Come on. Good job. Okay Mateo. You've got it. I'm almost there. Abby, Abby no! Evee, you don't have to do this. We don't have to live out our parents' lives. You don't get it. This is all your fault! Killing me won't change anything. I mean, I get it since your mom loves Paige so much better. No, mommy loves me best. You little psycho bitch. Abby! Get her, get her. Abby, grab the rope. - Come on Abby! - You can do it. You've got this! Pull her! Oh my God. We're alive, we're alive! Look at this! Quick, let's go! Stu, I need you to tie that. Extra tight, yeah. Yeah, come on, come on. You've got it, you've got it. Run. Okay Stu. Okay, just, you've got this. Pull tight. - He's down. - Okay. Just slow. Don't worry Jackie, you've got it. Jackie. Reagan, you're up. Well done. You've gotta catch her, you've gotta catch her, her ankle. Come on Reagan. Come on Mateo. Yeah, just go. No, no, no, no, no. You're almost there. Are you okay? You killed my sister! I'm coming for you! We're gonna have to catch her. Positions! - I've got the head. - Yeah, feet. Ready? Okay, yeah. Abby, jump! Pray for me. Oh my God, no. Go, go, go! Go! Oh no. Can't sneak up on a man's personal affirmation time. Rough night, huh? No time. Floor it, now! Time is ours for the taking my friend. Happiness is a state of consciousness... Sir! Which proceeds from the achievement of... You think you can kill my sister and just drive away? You're not going anywhere! Gun it. Ha ha, you missed me! Oh God, did we just... Vamanos Diablos. Diablos. Diablos, circle up. We went through a hell of a lot last year. We lost members of our cheer family, but they're not gone from our hearts. They'll always be a part of us and this team. And to all our new members, thank you all for joining this new chapter of Diablo Cheer. Let's kick some Green Knight butt! Bring it on! Put 'em in. One, two, Diablo! Diablo, Diablo, Diablo, Diablo. The winners in this final showdown... The Diablos!
