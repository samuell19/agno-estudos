In recent months we have heard a lot about Lyn May in Mexico's popular entertainment circles. We want to ask about her aspirations. Will you carry on dancing? Will you do any acting work? What are your plans? I want to be a showgirl. A real showgirl. A showgirl is a very complete person. They are multitalented artists. Their work is very versatile. A woman who shows off her body, right? Depending on your perspective, they are titillating or an art form. Artists in the fullest sense of the word. Showgirls are artists taking part in a show, it's a job like any other and they're very professional. BEAUTIES OF THE NIGHT A WOMAN... A STAR... SHE'S THE BEST! MEXICO'S SMALLEST WAIST I mean, a showgirl dressed up... for the stage. Just imagine: they announced your name, they announced you, the spotlights came on, and you sashayed onstage, looking stunning. What do you think when you look at such a stunning showgirl... at the age of 62? We're beautiful women, and we use that beauty as part of the show. As Albert Einstein said: "The best thing is to live around beauty". We must seek beauty. Here I am, striking a pose... wow, wow. What do you want, meow? Whenever I walk in, I have an impact, and I love that. Down with modesty! Let's be real. When I walk in, men and women look at me. I didn't burst onto the scene as a showgirl, but as a dancer... And model. When I learned how to sing, journalists started calling me a showgirl. "What's that?" I asked. I love singing, dancing, acting... Wearing... those headdresses, with pheasant and ostrich feathers. I love birds, I adore them. Peacocks, I would love to be a peacock with that magnificent tail. Yes, I wear their feathers. I used to think they pulled them out, and I felt bad. But now I know that they molt them. They're so elegant! They just drop an old feather and grow a new one! Well, I take them and wear them like a bird of paradise. ...you feel the poise, the charm of a showgirl. At the end of the show, you raise your arms like this, you never bend over. and then you walk offstage in triumph. Let's see. Hold it there! It's perfect. Juanito, I'll wear this during the song, then we'll head back there with another outfit for the interview. That'll add some texture, right? Everyone wants to see Olga! "Everyone wants to see Olga", one... -Two. -Three, four. Everyone wants to see Olga! Everyone wants to see Olga! Chorus! One, two, three! Everyone wants to see Olga! Everyone wants to see Olga! Sing along! Everyone wants to see Olga! All together now! Everyone wants to see Olga! Because she's a real star! Come on, let me hear it! Come on, let me hear it! Everyone wants to see Olga! Because she's a real star! Everyone wants to see Olga! Everyone wants to see Olga! Everyone wants to see Olga! Because she's a real star! Olga, I see you've got some of the albums that you recorded. Show them to the camera. On this record, I played the violin with my father. I spent many hours learning to play, it takes discipline. The violin is very demanding. Demanding? All instruments are. Mastering any discipline takes dedication. I rebelled against the businessmen who paid attention to everything except my violin playing. "Why don't you wear this? Why don't you do you hair differently? Why won't she wear that? Why violin playing and not dancing?" Okay, is that what you want? If I must give in to your demands, let's create a character. Thirty years ago, we all wanted... back in my day, my peers and I, "I want to be a big star, travel everywhere, and make a fortune, have a big house and lots of cars." Okay, then. Ma'am, let me take your measurements. Can I get your autograph, please? Your waist is 15 inches! Let's fix your headdress. We're on in about half an hour. Miss, with your permission I'll take the RV for a service. Miss Olga, we're on in half an hour. Olga has learned that... being a star doesn't last forever. It's heartbreaking when an artist who had it all in life, feels that something is missing when she's not on stage, when she doesn't have a magnificent stage. or a soap opera, a film, a play, or a record, a film, it doesn't matter, it's all the same. It's all part of the same fantasy. You think that youth will last forever, little do you know that it's over in a flash.. Then you realize that your appeal can't be based on that, all bodies grow older, youthful looks fade. Fashions change, young artists come and go... Some people say that... the past was always better. Today, I choose to disagree with that expression. When you're young, you have so many dreams. Well, I was a showgirl, I'd loved dancing since I was a kid. When I was nine years old, they tried to laugh at me. And then... My father's niece asked me: "What do you want to be when you grow up?" I was at a loss, so I said: "I'm going to be an artist." She looked at me derisively, and said: "Why would you want to be an artist?" I didn't know what to answer, so I said: "Because I've got belle gambe." She didn't bother me anymore. We're at Princesa Yamal's place, Can you introduce us to your family? Of course! Here is my dearest mother, my cousin and my little brother. I also have a sister, she's in her room, she's not feeling well today. What was she like as a little girl? She was very mischievous. Very lively... She sang, danced, she couldn't keep still. She was a lively, healthy girl. Was it difficult for you to start out as a showgirl? No, it wasn't difficult. My physique made it easier since I was quite young. I don't have a voluptuous body, but it is attractive. That helped me break into showbusiness. Onstage I became someone else, it wasn't me. I was Princesa Yamal. I've always wanted to be a... special person. You were unattainable, weren't you? We were like goddesses. That's what we were. Even as a showgirl myself, I looked at the others and thought: "Dear Lord, what is this?" We were like a dream, something else... You have one pair of eyes, facing millions of eyes out there. Imagine how strong you have to be, the energy you need, the mastery you need to keep them all under your spell. It's almost like spiritual strength, an energy from within, the audience can feel it. If they sense that you have power, you're inscrutable. If you exude that... then they are hooked. You have to cast a spell on them, How can I say it? You must emanate a vibe... that you're one of a kind, that you're like... like you're a real princess. It's not a lie to say: I am Princess Yamal of Arabia, Like Cleopatra, I am a... a goddess, do you understand? Then you have to... convey that personality. My darlings, let me invite you to spend... a normal day with me. We all want a massage! We all want a massage! Right, Juan Carlos? My chin, in case there's a close-up. Up we go! Come on, my friends! Cheer up! You're beautiful if you want to be! Just believe in it, because God made you beautiful! But you have to do your part, do what it takes, to show the beauty that God gave you! All women, even if you're no spring chicken, and we were all young once, all women can recover their self-esteem, their security and their inner peace. Now comes the best part. As Jesus said: "The best wine is served last." Now comes your best wine, little Olga. The one you're getting now. So give it all you've got! You can do it! Mmm... lovely. Thank you, Lord. Kiss me Kiss me a lot as if tonight were the last time Kiss me Kiss me a lot because I'm afraid I'll lose you afterwards. Kiss me Kiss me a lot as if tonight were the last time Kiss me Kiss me a lot because I'm afraid of losing you again The thing is, I don't think about my age, I don't have time for that. I'm too busy, I take dance lessons, I take singing lessons. I'm always taking one class or another, I don't have time to think about my age. Exercise and sex are my two favorite things. I have sex three times a day, and I spend about ten hours a day exercising. But I also rest, of course. I rest... You must have some good tricks. Of course, I have great tricks. Can you give us any tips? Well, you can climb up a tree with your partner, and it feels really good up there. I've done that. What? Up a tree? Sure! Haven't you ever had sex up a tree? It's... amazing. It really is. You should try it some time, you'll see. But how do you get up there? You just climb up... Well, I'm from Acapulco. Your partner can help you, he, like... and it feels great. There are many ways... Doing laundry too. That's always fun. Then you need to shake it... with him underneath. Imagine... Just imagine, with this move, who can resist it? I've never considered myself a sex symbol. I don't like that term, sex symbol. Because I am... normal, natural. I mean, no. A sex symbol is an icon, but I don't feel like that. I'm a person, made of flesh and blood, a very passionate, sexy person. I like what you don't like I like what scares you And although I love you I love you I want to be at the top of your list I like what you don't like I like what scares you And although I love you I love you I want to be at the top of your list Do you believe that nudity is sinful? No, I don't. Do you like your appearance in the movie? Well, I'd say... no, because I'm not used to seeing myself onscreen. But the audience liked it. If this film is a hit, will you give up being a stripper? I don't think so, because stripping is in my blood. I've loved taking my clothes off since I was born. I like showing off, I like... I don't think I'll ever give it up. Well, as long as I have something to show, right? When I was five, I went to a school run by nuns. In those religious schools, you can't even show your ankles. We even showered with our clothes on. The nuns used to say, this is real, that we should never see our private parts. Ever. They wore a nightgown in the shower, and we wore pants and a long-sleeved t-shirt. Up to here. So I knew nothing about myself until I left Catholic school. When did you first perform nude, Rossy? I was 18. That was my first time. I just pulled off my clothes. I felt no shame, no... Some of my favorite paintings, Rubens... All those things of beauty are nudes! Michelangelo has some fantastic nudes. Why be ashamed of a naked body? This is the morning song that King David used to sing. Today being Rossy's birthday so we're singing it to her Wake up, Rossy, wake up the day has dawned the birds are singing and the moon has set Rossy, Rossy, ra, ra, ra! There goes the alligator heading to Baranquilla There goes the alligator heading to Baranquilla What this alligator eats Is a sight to see What this alligator eats Is a sight to see It eats bread and cheese and washes it down with rum It eats bread and cheese and washes it down with rum There goes the alligator Take your clothes off! heading to Baranquilla There goes the alligator... There you go! I was never really into posing. It wasn't easy for me, I hated it! You see, honey, I had to pose for seven or eight hours, it was exhausting. "Keep still, turn that way, look this way. I don't like that expression, relax." Also, I wasn't so voluptuous. They used camera angles, do you understand? They made me look plumper. In that day, they liked women like this... Right? And I was very skinny. They made me eat like a pig to fatten me up. Oh, God. "Come on Yamal, you're too skinny. Eat up!" They stuffed me like a pig. I got fatter and fatter, because they liked curves. Curvy women were all the rage. That's why Rossy Mendoza was such a hit, with her broad hips, or Lyn May... Mamma mia! Oh, mamma, me voglio maritare Oh, papa, pesce fritt'e baccalà... I was a real artist. When I see myself in those pictures, I think "Is that me? Oh my god" How time flies, you change so much. But who you are inside never changes, right? Your skin gets wrinkled, not your soul. Come here! Tango! Tango! Tango! Show me your teeth, Tango! Show me your teeth, Tango! Look! Show me your teeth, Tango. Tango. Tango is the one over there, the one that's looking at me. They're my life! I've broken up with men over them... "Oh, no, the dogs..." Shh, bye. And two hours later: "Hey, it's not such a big deal, I'll come and pick you up." No, many of them are already out of my plans. I really want a rest. I'll stay here in the room ordering food, food. With the air conditioning on and my Bouzo beside me. Who's Bouzo? Bouzo was a french poodle. It was a hectic lifestyle, of nightclubs and late nights. And one day I decided: "No, I want to lead a normal lifestyle. I wanted to feel what it was like... to sleep at night and be awake during the day, Feel the warmth of the sun", because... When you stay up so late, you don't get up before one or two in the afternoon. So I changed my life, but suddenly, at night, I'd wake up with a start thinking I'd overslept. "I'm late for the show!" What show? I'd quit the nightclub. And I'd think: "Is this me living a new life?" I feel like, this is true, I felt different, like a stranger, like I wasn't myself. But I love watching myself. How do you feel when you see yourself? I like it. I like it a lot. Want to see another one? Oh, no! Not this one. Put it on fullscreen. Not this one! Look at the actor groping you. How rude! What a rascal he is, look at that. Can you tell me about that crown? Ah, yeah. This crown is because... I've just been crowned queen of the tla-coyo. Tlacoyo. Tlacoyo is a type of food I didn't know because I'm from northern Mexico, but it's delicious. It's a stuffed tortilla, it can be stuffed with cheese curd or potato, they fold it and cook it, it's so tasty. then they add some cheese, salsa and, What... What's it called? Cilantro. It's delicious! And I'm the Tlacoyo Queen. The Tlacoyo Queen. La reina del tlacoyo. One, two, three, four five, six, seven, right Where? Nowhere. The phone is ringing. Ah, I just talked to a... Hello? Hello? Yeah... Speak up. Speak up, yes. A demonstration for the protection of stray dogs... Yes... Yeah, please tell him that... anything for animals, I'll be there. Yes. Okay, over and out. Save the dogs! Animal abuse is not a show! Animal abuse is not a show! Animal abuse is not a show! Animal abuse is not a show! Animal abuse is not a show! Animal abuse is not a show! Let's carry on marching! ...criminal offense Make animal abuse a criminal offense! Make animal abuse a criminal offense! Make animal abuse a criminal offense! Make animal abuse a criminal offense! How was it? Fantastic. Let's see... You may fool them all but not me You're a real actor and the director of the show You don't care that with it you're destroying an innocent heart You may have bought them all but not me You gift loving promises They are young and they believe your lies Your deceit is tiresome I better leave You may fool them all, but not me You're a real actor and the director of the show Your lies sound true but your deceit is tiresome I better leave I've had enough I'm no longer that fool who fell in love Because the real star of this show... Listen to this part. is me So goodbye to you So long! The show's over That's what I say to men: You may fool the others, but not me. Not anymore. Do you fall in love easily, Rossy? Superficially. I've never felt the love that poets write about. I fall in and out of love quickly. I had lots of boyfriends. I did. But men need attention, right? They need attention and I need it as well Once I had a boyfriend... We were starting out but I liked him, this was in Guadalajara, He handed me a pile of socks. "Should I throw them away?" I asked. "No" he said, "You have to wash them". "Who, me?" "Yes". I didn't know how. We were staying in a grand hotel. With a beautiful, huge tiled bathroom. Huge. It was incredibly elegant and luxurious. So I sat down and turned on the shower. That night, I couldn't make it to the night club. I got sick. Me? Washing socks? What's that about? "Never again" I said. "I'll never do a man's laundry again! No way." Are you there? There you are, my sweetie pie! Should I come over? What will you cook for me? Mmm, my favorite! I don't cook, my husband does that. That's right! Let him do it! Besides, he's a great cook! I married a Chinese man, We were married for 20 years. He was a good man, a very nice person, very respectful, very pleasant, very... very honest. Chinese men are very nice. We were married for 20 years, he died, and left me a widow... Losing... someone is terrible. That's when I felt like I was hitting rock bottom. I felt terrible. I wanted to get my husband out of the cemetery, to have him with me. I felt so bad that I did just that. I went to fetch him, took him... took him home, and I... I slept with him here. I slept with him for... about two months. I'd get ready for bed, I'd cover myself with... a sheet and a blanket, and I had him right next to me. Then my mom started calling me all the time, and she took him away. I've been married seven times. I may change your name but I won't change the story Whatever your name is you're like heaven to me You're my secret love Secret love You're my secret love Secret love You're my secret love You're my secret love Don't look at me when there are people around, don't sigh don't call me even though you love me When there are people around I'm just a friend I'm telling you it's torture You're my secret love What about your suitors? How did they...? We've already discussed this, but tell me more... How did they seduce you? Did men harass you? I wouldn't say they harassed me, I'd say they wooed me, With... gifts, back then, men were... Men were... What's the word? When they give you... Generous. No, another word... Extravagant. Men were extravangant. They'd give me a ruby bracelet, a Rolex, jewelry... Who knows what happened to all that! And if they liked the show they'd give me a gold coin. I had a little chest full of gold coins. Who knows that happened to it? I lost it all. But yeah, they gave me lots of gifts. Bottles of champagne. Rivers of champagne. I get up at seven o'clock... This is the life of Wanda Seux, at high speed. But this is how I like it. I wouldn't change it for anything. I have no luxuries, I used to, though. I was on top of the world. I've done that. As long as God gives me enough to eat, and enough for my dogs, enough for my medicine, that's all I need. How did you indulge yourself? My indulgences were... making my mom happy. Letting her travel, enjoy life. And all I did was work and work. That's what made Amanda and Wanda Seux happy. That's my mom. I don't want any of you out here! No, eh! Nobody messes with me! You're in for it! What a rebel! WANDA SEUX A FIERY BEAUTY Crazy, crazy that's what they say Crazy, crazy, crazy for your love That's enough I don't want to be without you If this world is crazy that's how I want to live Life is so good when you're by my side I'm yours, come what may because I truly love you I want my piece of this world I'm happy to be your love Crazy, crazy they say I am Crazy, crazy crazy for your love That's enough I don't want to be without you You're shameless, Wanda. I've had offers... even though I'm 62 years old. People have said: "Take this check", but if you take the check, you know they want something in return. Do you make a lot of money? Pues no me quejo de nada, te lo juro. Sadly, by the time I was 20 but I had also started... to dabble with drugs, which just appeared in my dressing room. I never asked for them, but drugs just appeared. "You know what? A famous artist has to do drugs, have some." No guidebook, just "have some!" "Un artista famoso debe tener siempre licor en su camerino". So you start going overboard... physically, emotionally, spiritually... and why not say it? Sexually. So then... you realize that life is a game, and I decided to play You can pretend to be happy. But when everyone's gone, you cry over a bottle of brandy. "Why did I say I was happy? Why did I lie?" You had no choice, honey. You live in a world of lies. With all that energy you get from the crowd, that one gave to the crowd, you go back to your hotel, if you're on tour, and you feel as if the walls and the ceiling were closing in on you. It seems like... The loneliness seems to crush you. The loneliness is overwhelming. Whenever I feel down, or very sad, sometimes I wake up like that... Well, that's my case, I don't know if it happens to other people, but some days I wake up kind of sad, dejected, like, ay! So what do I do? I read, I nurture myself. To... feed my spirit. To shake off the sorrow. Because God doesn't like it when you're sad. That's why he gave us this world of beauty, so that we could rejoice and be happy. Instead of looking for an oriental guru like The Beatles, I started reading to search for an answer. Reading did me a lot of good. I'm writing a book, which takes up all my time. -You're writing a book? -Yes. What's it about? Metaphysics. -Chúpale, pichón. -That's really something. -What was that? -Chúpale, pichón. My brother always says that! It sounds lovely! Metaphysics. So you're into metaphysics? I started writing this book a long time ago, around 1990. But then I stopped. Now that I no longer have the pressure of showbusiness, I started writing again, but it's been... How long? Almost twenty years since I put it away in a suitcase. I can't find the Tapazole. That's for my thyroid. Here it is. Another one for my thyroid. The oncologist gave me this one. Iron Polymaltose complex and vitamins. That's enough medicine. Hello? Hello, Wanda. It's me, honey. I'm filming with María José. Well, Maria Jose... showed me a magazine and I... I don't know what to say. How are you? You don't say. What tires you out? Why is that so tiring? What is it? Oh, dear Lord. But how are you? How are you doing, honey? But you know what? You won't lose your hair. You're a strong woman. You'll get through this, honey. I brush my hair slowly because of the chemo, I'm afraid of losing my hair. I pray to God that I won't. This morning, in the National Anthropology Museum, the worst theft of archaeological items in Mexican history was discovered. The museum, like it does every day, closed at six o'clock, yesterday, December 24th. Today at eight o'clock, 14 hours later, when the guard changed, seven display cases in the Mayan, Mexica, and Oaxacan halls had been plundered. This is the worst theft of its kind in Mexican history. This is a lie! It's awful! GRAND THEFT AT ANTHROPOLOGY MUSEUM SEVEN ARRESTED FOR ANTHROPOLOGY MUSEUM THEFT SHOWGIRL "PRINCESA YAMAL" WAS INVOLVED NO ESCAPE FOR MUSEUM THIEVES PRINCESA YAMAL HELD WITHOUT BAIL NOT AN ACCOMPLICE, OR A THIEF SHE KNEW NOTHING OF HER LOVER'S CRIMES STORMY LOVE AFFAIR LANDS PRINCESA YAMAL IN JAIL "I'M INNOCENT" CLAIMS PRINCESA YAMAL Look, I thought I was in a movie. But me? Forget about it. They accused me of stealing from the nation. But, no, no. It's unexplainable, honey... I mean, it's... My God, why would I do that? When? There was also, you know, a moment where they take away your dignity. They treat you like a piece of shit. You're nobody in there. Not a princess, you're nothing. Do you understand? I was blindfolded for 72 hours. There, in jail. They told me to sign a confession. There was a girl in there who'd been sentenced to 40 years. They'd beaten the shit out of her. "That's what we'll do to you," they said. "You'd better sign, Yamal, or else..." And I thought: "When will I break?" After 72 hours they wanted to handcuff me, I slept on the ground, no sheets, nothing. No food for 72 hours, it was awful. Seventy-two hours blindfolded, damn it! How long were you in there? Two years and nine months. But it felt like 10 years. Every day lasts an eternity, never mind the nights. One day after another. I wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemy, on anybody. It was a terrible miscarriage of justice, because... it ended my career. She puts her hands on the floor everyone's clapping in Paseo de las Luminarias She's an icon among showgirls in Latin America and the world: Wanda Seux! Thank you! Thank you! Welcome! Wanda! Yeah! Here she is, for our friends in the press. Turn it up, please. Súbele el tono. Plaza de las Estrellas is where they are Where all of them... Let's hear it for Wanda Seux! Let me introduce you to someone who loves you all: Juana Amada Seux Ramírez. Bravo! She's beautiful! Let's hear it! She's such a brave lady. Wanda Seux! No more contracts. No more gigs. All the properties I'd accumulated in this world were sold off because I ran out of money. There came a time when... it felt as if the world had turned its back on me. Everything started to collapse, like in the 1985 earthquake, which destroyed my hotel in Mexico City. I saw my life plummet from the 15th floor, where I spent my best years, I watched it fall apart. Consequence: I thought my career was over. I went to bed, and slept through 2005... the whole year... I took anxiety pills, blood pressure pills, obesity pills, painkillers, medicine for my bones, medicine for my nightmares, pills for my sadness, for my depression and anxiety. It was a pathetic cocktail. Then... the reptile spoke to me. It said: "Enough of this shame, put an end to this failure". All of us... have light within... and inner strength that elevates us, do you understand? How many times have I cried alone? But you have to be strong, because no one loves people who have been defeated. You have to stand up... get over whatever mess you're in. But always being true to yourself. You look great as a blonde. You have delicate features. You have a sublime face. You look sublime. I forgot to take all my pills. No way, you want me to pick them up for you? No, later... I'll open the window for some fresh air... Listen, how could you forget your pills? You brought everything... Because I went to put the dog to sleep, I wasn't in my right mind. María José came with me. We put Canelita to sleep, she was 18. -Did she die? -I sang to her. No, I put her to sleep. I sang to her. But she's dead? If you're singing, well... What will you do when I die? What will you sing? This dear girl wants to sleep And sleep won't come it won't come Go to sleep, my sunshine, go to sleep, my dear Now I'm saying, we're going to a modest neighborhood, a normal one. Down to earth, affordable. Where you don't live to pay the bills. Before, you'd pay more to keep up appearances. "I'll live here so they can see I'm in a desirable address." That's not right. As John 8:32 says: "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." It set me free, I'm free now. No Jaguar, no BMW, no Mercedes, no chauffeur, no mansion, and I'm the happiest, most relaxed person. My narrow little street, a tiny living room. Thank you, Lord, you are good. Just look how peaceful it is. When I raise my hands I start to feel a passion that urges me to sing When I raise my hands I start to feel a flame When I raise my hands You have reached Sister Olga Breeskin's ministry, kindly state your name and the purpose of your call. May God bless you. This is the bedroom. And yeah... Now it's time to rest. This is where I put my computer, my iPad, the phone. And this is the most important book of all: my precious Holy Bible. I lock myself in and say: "Oh Lord, help me Lord! Speak to me, Lord, because I would really love to have a drink or two." It's where it comes from. It's called a clamor. Lord help me. I know you don't like this, I know it's against your commandments, which say: "Do not get drunk, thou shalt not fornicate, thou shall only spend money on bread." All those things that happen in a casino, are against the word of the Lord. Why does he tell you not to do it? Because it's bad for you. How do I know that? Because it was bad for me. When I feel weak Raise your hands! I raise my hands Although I have thousands of problems... Although I have thousands of problems When I raise my hands, I start to feel a passion that urges me to sing Place your left hand here. -Yes, sweetie. -Your right hand. Close your eyes, let's ask together in silence. for the information you need, for a happier, settled life. Thanks so much. -Success is on the way. -Really? -I don't know much about your life. -Yes. I know a bit about your celebrity, not much, but I can see you doing other things. Do you write? -Sometimes. -You do? Maybe some articles? A book you want to write? -Yes. -Memoirs or something? Just look at this doorstopper. What inspired you to write it? It was mostly my own doubts, regarding... what are we doing here? Why are we on this planet? What kind of a joke is this? What brought us here? I felt, well. I wondered who was pulling the strings, and having fun with my life. Here, at the top, I want to write "Universes" then the word "in" and then, down here... to make it bigger around "evolution" and then the word "evolution" appears. Come here. I want to feel your presence, beloved Mexican brothers and sisters. I want to share this blessing that helped me stand up. Come closer, he wants to embrace you. I want to give you this love that flows through my body. Beloved Mexican men and women, you witnessed my birth, you saw me rise, and you saw me fall. Now I am here, to share the best, the only truth. Come closer, never mind what others may say, what they think is worthless. He welcomes you, whether you are young or old, rich or poor, educated or uneducated. He loves and welcomes you, and I need you here tonight. I love you, with the pure love of Jesus Christ, after you've left everything to be with Breeskin today. Let's hear it for the Lord, Jesus of Nazareth, the Lamb of God! Hold out your hands, please. Dear Father, we thank you, Dear Jesus, thank you. Lord, you are so good, you really are. You are so good, Jesus. You are so good, Lord, you're too good. When we deserve punishment and death, you give us life, dear Jesus. Carry on blessing your servant, Lord, Carry on filling her with your Holy grace, Lord. Fill her with your love! Fill her with your love! Fill her with your love! Fill her with your love! Fill her with your love, Lord! I've only fallen in love once... I've had many... I've had many boyfriends. But I only fell in love with one man: he's the man I live with. Yes, Guillermo. Guillermo is the love of my life. And he's the last man I'll ever have, as a woman, as a human being. He completes me. Guillermo is my partner, my lover, my husband, my everything. He completes me. So I think I'll die with him. We'll go to the grave hand in hand. That's what I think. It's like a telenovela, isn't it? Just like a telenovela, but one with a happy ending. I'm 66 years old. Here I am, my Lord. Here I am for you. But let me be human, too. To be defeated by whatever you send my way, complete. Entera. And hug my mother. Who am I... to ask this of you? I am a person who has to fight every single day to survive, damn it! Give me a chance to say... Give me work. I want to earn money! I want to do things. To ask the producers: What's wrong with this? This. I'm a professional, I give it all on stage. This. My age? This. Comes from a lifetime of smiles. This. This is caused by the fucking relentless years that run you over If it weren't for you, Samantha Hernandez, who gives me botox, and hyaluronic acid, which lets me look like this. The glorious... Wanda Seux. But Amanda Seux is also in here. And these are the last tears that I... will shed in my life. Success is coming. Good things are coming. Okay? Yes, we're strong. Although we're older, we still have faith in ourselves. I still believe that I can be successful again. And I won't be defeated. Ever. It's like riding on horseback. This is great! What great music! What are you going to do? I'm marking specific points. There's creases here. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me ask the teacher I don't know if I can put some here. I'll ask the teacher. Lift your chin. This is a new technique they've added new stuff. It's wonderful. Wait, did I put it here, or here? I can't remember. Don't laugh. -I can't remember. -You put it here, and here. -Not here? -No. -Not here? -Yes. Or did you? In the name of the Father... In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. We ask you, Our Lady of Guadalupe, to... ...give her energy, health, life. Energy... And protect her with your sacred mantle of light and stars, so she'll always be protected by you. So nobody will harm her, and her path will always be full of light... Here it is: "Universes in Evolution" When you persevere in life, and you don't give up, and when you fall, you pick yourself up and carry on and you don't give up or accept defeat, that's when, at my age... Which is 45. Sure, yeah, of course. Whatever, but at my age, I am proud to be with my daughter, to have achieved happiness with her, above all. My love for her. so that when my time is up, I can say: "Everything I've achieved is yours." She'll take good care of it. But mom, you'll never leave me, you're staying here. Life doesn't last forever. You know what I'll do? Have you heard about Walt Disney? Oh, God! They froze him, so they could bring him back to life. That's what I'll do, mom. I'll put you in a freezer, or a beer cooler, to freeze you. Okay, my dear, okay. Why is life so short, dear? It's so fleeting, you take a breath and it's gone. All that's left is the memory of your loved ones, who eventually forget you. These happy moments we're experiencing, are wonderful moments that cannot be repeated. In time you realize this, because time collects its debts. But freedom is wonderful. Freedom of conscience, of speech, of thought, to be yourself, without any fakery. That is true freedom. I learned in an instant, in the blink of an eye... that I could have ceased to exist in this world. What a beautiful radiance. As I'm speaking, God is sending me this light, and I am so grateful. He's sending me the energy of the world. Of... Behold, the rebirth of Wanda Seux. Freedom! This is like... Titanic, right? Like that. It's lovely. This is freedom. I love you all, I love life, I love to love. I love my great friends, and above all, I love my daughter. It's so peaceful. I'm very happy. Thank you for remembering me. Freedom! What does it mean to be a star? What? What does that mean? It means that stars shine when the sun sets. BEAUTIES OF THE NIGHT Now let's hear it for the audience. It's a wrap.
