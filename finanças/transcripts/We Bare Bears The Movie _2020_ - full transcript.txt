Is this what being an influencer feels like? Oh! Feels nice. I don't even know what poutine is. What's poutine?! It's the most delicious treat ever! And you know it's good 'cause it's from Canada! Yes, Canada... land of the free, home of the brave! Plus, we love bears! See? Aw, neat! We'll have three poutines, please. Comin' right up! Hey, guys! Get in! Get in, guys! Say "poutine." Poutine! So, I decided to start over and rebrand myself online as a cool guy this time. CoolGuy28 to be exact. Mm. I can smell the likes already. Order up! Three poutines! Hmm? Oh. Guess we got here just in time. Look at all these hungry people. We're not hungry! We're angry! We're angry at you! Yeah! - Wha... - Huh? You ruined our wedding. You ruined my pizza! Uh, we're sorry. It was an accident. We didn't mean to. Well, we're tired of your antics! Ice Bear's antics are entertaining. That's just what we do. Yeah, it's fun and, uh, endearing. Alright, alright. Everyone calm down. Now, just state your complaints in an orderly fashion, and I'll add them to our bear-complaint file. Bear complaint file? What is that? Yep, "broke... skateboard." Uh-huh. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry. Just a sec. Thank you. "Stole... bear... complaint... binder." And he pushed me. Wha?! Can you guys believe this? "Bears are too big and loud." "Made tote bags uncool." "The panda keeps asking me out. He is so awkward. Why can't he take a hint?" This must be another panda, right? Oh, man! I had no idea people felt this way about us. Ice Bear not bad bear, just misunderstood. Ugh! We got to fix this. But what do we do? Huh? Hey, my car! - Uh! - Hey! - Hey! - Whoa! Now, you see here, mister! What's up? - Ah! It's Nom Nom! - It's Nom Nom! Oh, my God! It's Nom Nom! Aah! Ugh. Nom Nom. Hey, Nom Nom, do the face! Oh, you mean... this face? Oh, ho ho! Yeah, just give me the special. Oh! I have something extra special for you, Mr. Nom Nom, sir! Uh, hey, Nom Nom. Hey, Greg. Oh, i-it's Grizz. And here it is! It's a special Nom Nom poutine! Meh. I'm full. Hey! Ugh! I'm so sick of being treated like this! Nom Nom can get away with anything! I mean, I can't even get away with... "Sat on my birthday cake." Alright, I did do that. Well, what do you expect? That's just how people treat you when you make cool videos. Well, then we just need to make cool videos and stuff, too. Uh, Grizz, that never works. Remember? Mom? Are you in there? Here's your bottle. Now, try to get... Bad video. No likes. Look, my point is, people didn't watch our videos before, and they're not gonna watch them now. We're just not popular. But what if this time, we make the ultimate video! The most viral of the viral! I guess, but it's not like we can force people to watch our video. Ice Bear has idea. Aah! And... aha! Hey, lil' bro, how's it goin' up there?! Lil' bro?! Hacking complete. Ice Bear is in. Alright, alright, alright! Let's get this show on the road! Pan Man, how's the set coming along? Ugh! Ugh! Okay, I guess. Grizz, I don't know about this plan. Panda, it's foolproof. We're putting every popular Internet thing into one video! They're gonna love it! Uh, shouldn't we be a little more original? I mean, won't this seem, I don't know, a little cringey and passé? Yo, it'll go great, man. The Internet is a positive place, full of only kind and supportive people. Uh... Shh, shh. Do it for the likes. Okay, last thing we need is... Oh! Your phone. What? My phone? Why? We have to connect your account. CoolGuy28, right? How's that going, by the way? Wha?! How is that even possible?! Ugh. Okay, you're right. Nothin' left to lose. Ha ha! That's the spirit! Alright, places, everybody, places. Panda, you ready for your close-up? Yeah. I guess. Little bro? Ice Bear born ready. Okay, boys, it's showtime! Wah-ha-ha! Aah! Yo, Bay Area fam! You ready to party?! 'Cause things are about to get lit up in here! We're comin' at you with the most fire hits! Ugh! And don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe to bears!

Huh? What's happening? Aah! Aah! Oh! Aah! Help! Help! What are we gonna do? Well, stream's over, I guess. Do people like us now? Oh, sure. They're gonna love us. Uh-oh. Outraged citizens descend on city hall tonight in the aftermath of a massive blackout attributed to three bears and their desperate bid for attention. Quiet, please. Everyone, quiet. Now, I know you're upset, but if we all calm down, I'm sure these bears can explain themselves. Uh, geez. Um, sorry, everyone. We made a mistake. But good news. It's not gonna happen again. Right, bro?! Ice Bear is filled with deep regret. I'm sorry about everything. I thought it was a bad idea in the first place, but someone dragged me into it. Mm-hmm. Welp, there you go. Let's just jot this down in the bear file and... Boo! Boo! Boo! These bears should be held accountable! Their high jinks have gone on way too long! And they smell! Hmm. Okay, maybe pick up some trash or paint a fence, or... Huh? Who's that? Step aside. I'll take over from here. Uh, who are you? Agent Trout... Department of National Wildlife Control. I'm here because someone isn't doing their job. I apologize for being subtle, but it's you. You're not doing your job. See, you've got a bear problem. And I'm a problem solver. Bear problem? Bear problem. Nature. We all love nature. A stroll in the park, a hike on a sunny afternoon. But what happens when nature... invades?! Oh! Aah! Coyotes bullying schoolchildren! Pigeons dealing in contraband! Wild cougars stalking the innocent! I've seen it all, folks. But I've never seen anything as disturbing as what you see here today. Hey, is he talking about us? No comments until the end of the presentation. In this world, there is a natural order. And when that order is violated, when wild animals are allowed to live among us, in our communities, in our homes, that's when nature becomes unnatural. Are we really going to tolerate these bears wreaking havoc in the city? Walking on two legs? Talking?! - Yeah. - Sure, yeah. And the sickest, most disturbing thing these bears do? They stack! What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that?! These bears are a threat to the natural order! As long as they're here, your entire way of life is at risk. W-W-What do we do?! Simple. We do what I do best. Capture, detain, and relocate the infestation. Send these bears back to where they belong... a bear reserve! Cut off from human society forever! Yay! Yeah! No more bears! What now, Grizz?! I don't know. - Agh! Hey! - You can't do this! Hey! No! This is wrong! This is our home! You can't just force us out! Ugh! No! No! No! Please! Ow! Ow! Don't shove Ice Bear. Ice Bear knows where to go. Hold it. Leave us. You've been living among humans for so long, but that time has passed. You can't do this! This is our home! Yeah! We'll get a lawyer! Lawyer? Pfft. What are you gonna do? Pay them in honey? Farewell. Take 'em away. Pay them in honey. Ahh. What do you want? We want justice! This is unconstitutional! What are you, crazy? If you hurt them, I will... I will... write a very long letter to my senator! I'm not going to hurt them. I'm sending them to a place where they'll be happy. Isn't that what you want, little girl? Grrr. Officer Murphy is on his way delivering the bears as we speak, and there's nothing you can do to change that. Hey, Trout. Where'd the car go? Officer Murphy?! That's weird. I was just getting some coffee and doughnuts and... Ugh! If you're here, then who is driving the car?! Ow! Wha! Oof! Grizz, are you okay?! Hey! Would you mind not driving like a maniac! Aaaah! Aah! Aah! Aw, it's alright, Henry. The car sickness will go away soon. Charlie! Charlie! Oof! Hey, bears! A lil' birdie told me y'all were in some trouble. She also taught me how to hijack this police vehicle. Charlie! You're a life saver! Yeah, Charlie! We never would've guessed it was you! Aw, my Pan Pan! Get in here! Uh, shouldn't you be watching the road or somethin'? Ah, no worries. I got someone on it. Uh, how many animals did you bring with you? Huh, I don't know. Like, all of them? Ah, don't worry, bears. I got a plan to hide and everything. Oof! What's the news, Carl? Great. Squeak, squeak, squeak. Bears! Bears! Looks like the coast is clear, fellas. Here, put these on so nobody recognizes ya. What's the point? One for you. Everyone hates us. One for you. And that trout guy wants to throw us in bear jail. And one for you. Ice Bear always the outlaw. Never the law. I don't know what we're gonna do. Here's what you do! Burn all your stuff! The more precious, the warmer the fire. Ah! My stuff! Oh! We'll never find a place to call home again. Mi casa no casa. What a cruel world! Huh? Ooh! Ooh! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Alright, who's ready to burn off their fingerprints? Bros, I know what we can do! Canada! We can start a new life in Canada! What? Canada? Yeah, Canada! Everyone's brave! Everything's free! And they love bears in Canada. Just look at this picture. We wouldn't have to hide. We could be free, livin' the Canadian dream. Um, I don't think this is a good idea, Grizz. We don't even have passports. We don't need passports. We're bears! Pfft. So, uh... So what are we gonna do? Change the car so we can drive around undetected? ♪ Got my homie on the side ♪ ♪ And he's got a fly ride ♪ ♪ So pure, so solid the beat amplified ♪ ♪ I swerve to the left, the dude is calling out ♪ ♪ "Yo, que paso" ♪ Great job, boys. Thank you so much, Charlie, for everything. Keep in touch, you know. Ice Bear will never forget Charlie's face... and feet. Ah, it was nothin', bears. I'd do anything for you guys. Okay, now, where's Panda? Huh? Huh? What's he doin'? Ah, I'll see what's up. He lo-o-oves me. Hey, Pan Man, you all set to go to Canada? I know you might be a little tense from nerves, but... Waaah! Ugh! Stop! We-We're r-rushing into this way too fast! Canada?! I-I wanna stay here! Hey, I don't wanna leave either, man. But we don't have a choice, Panda. But we're leaving everything behind! Our home! Our friends! Our whole life! It's way too risky! Panda, I know it's a risk, but trust your big bro! If we work together, everything will work out fine... No, Grizz! Come on, little bro. You know it's smarter to stay here. Lil' bro knows that staying here is a bad idea! We gotta go to Canada! We should stay! Go! Stay! Please don't... break Ice Bear. Waaah! Aah! Aah! Ugh! You wanna go to Canada so bad, just go without me! Fine! Fine! Fine! Come on. Let's go. What are you so happy about? Oh, nothing! Just the fact that we have all this time to hang out and be best friends in the woods all alone forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. Wait up! Wait! Wait! Wait for me! Ugh! I knew you'd come around, Pan Pan. Yeah, yeah, don't rub it in. I'm only here to make sure you two don't get into any more trouble. Sounds good to me! And I've got an idea to get us going. Oh, yeah. Whoo-hoo-hoo! ♪ Oh, baby ♪ Yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about! Hit it, brotha! We are driving to Canada in style, Baby! Whoo! Huh? Oh. Duh! The lid was on. Hey, guys! I think I found another clue! - Yay! - That's my boy! Well, the cave is completely empty. Looks like the bears skipped town. So case closed. This case isn't closed until I say it is. Uh, but they're gone. Isn't that what you wanted? Don't worry. You and your adorable little team can relax. I've called my own reinforcements to finish the job. Reinforcements? Huh? Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Uh, Trout? This seems like a lot. Listen up. Three fugitive bears are on the loose, and we're going to find them. Let's show Officer Murphy how we handle wild animals.

They'll never find us. Don't think of this as us being on the run. Think of it more like... a road trip! What? A road trip? But, Grizz, we're wanted. We're criminals! And... And... Shh-shh-shh.

Can you follow me? Please? Uh, sure. Who are you? I'm Pizza Rat! Um, here you go. Yeah! One million and one followers. One million. Aw, come on, bros. Getting followers is so hard, especially when everyone started copying my video. Bruh! Stop that! I-I'll sue you, man! I will, bro! Mm, anyways, so, how many followers do you guys have? How'd you guys go viral? Nah, man. We aren't actually Internet famous. They're not famous? What up? I thought you bears were viral video stars. Y'all were just basic this whole time? Mm. This party's for Internet animals only! - It's against the rules! - Boo! Well, we tried to go viral. Follow me at CoolGuy28. Ice Bear popular in Asia. Uh, what are you guys gonna do? We're callin' the po-po. Oh, no. Trout. Please let us go! - Stop! Stop! - Call the cops! You don't understand! Please! You don't understand, sir! Wait! No! No! Stop! Just hear us out! Parlay! - Huh? - What? What? Grizz, what are you doing? I don't know. I heard it in a movie. "Parlay"? What does that even mean? "Parlay... to cease fire and hold a conference with the opposing side." Hmm. Well, sounds like we got to hear 'em out. - Okay. - Makes sense. Uh... Look, I-I'm sorry, everyone. We... We didn't mean to crash your party. We just... crashed our car, and now we're stuck here. Please. We got kicked out of our home just because we're bears. Being Ice Bear shouldn't be a crime. We're just trying to get to Canada to maybe find a place that will accept us for who we are. Nobody cares about us because we're different. Haven't you had any people judge you like that? Yeah. People think I'm mad all the time because I look angry. But this is just my face. I have other feelings, too. Nobody takes me seriously as an artist just because I paint with my nose. And everyone just looks at me as a buff kangaroo, but I am so much more than that. Why can't the people see? The world can be a cruel and unkind place. We just want to believe that it's not all like that. Hey, maybe we did judge you unfairly. We're sorry, bears. Listen, we'll fix your car so you can find your new home. We're on it! That was real inspiring, bears! Yeah, we'll hook you up! Come with me. You can stay with us for the night. - Wow. Thanks! - Thanks, you guys! Thanks, everyone! We love you! What? They get to stay? It took me 500,000 followers before you even let me in! How's that fair? I'll end you, bro. Hey, Grizz, what happens if we never find a new home? Hmm. I don't know. I never thought about it. Ice Bear full of uncertainty. Yeah, don't worry, bros. We always figure it out. Yeah, you're right. Well, good night. Sweet dreams. Good night. No! Huh? Please don't step on me, Grizz! Oh, hey, Pan. What are you doing down there, bud? Hey, no worries. I got you, dude. Let me carry you the rest of the way. Gee, thanks, Grizz! Huh? Ha! Hey, lil' bro! Alright, don't worry. I can help you both off this bridge. Yay! Oh, no! The train! It's gonna get us! Not to worry, bros. Plenty of time to get off the tracks. Hey, Grizz, can you help me out, too? Sure, no worries, guys. Huh? Welcome aboard. What about me? And me! - Thanks, Grizz! Appreciate it! - You're the best! - Thanks, Grizz! - Thank you! Appreciate it, bro! Aah! Huh? Oh, phew. - Aaah! - Aaah! Aah! - Oh, no! - We're not gonna make it! - Help us, Grizz! - He's gonna catch us! Don't worry, bros! I'll make sure you're safe! Aaaah! No! No! Please! No! Farewell, bear. No! G-Grizz, what's... what's wrong? Never mind. I think I need some fresh air. Okay. If you need anything... Ugh, I can't see a thing. It's too dark in here. Guys! Guys! Get up! Get up! Grizz, stop waking us up. What is it this time? Aah! This is the end of the line, bears. We have you surrounded. Come out with your paws up. Aah! How'd they find us?! Sorry, bears. I had to snitch. Pizza Rat! Hey! I followed you, man! I know, but so did they. Yes! Yes! More followers! Take 'em down, boys. Aaah! Oh, no! What do we do?! You're not welcome here! Animals! Drop the beat. Come on! Hurry! Run for your lives! You fools! Come back! They're just a bunch of wild animals! Actually, they're not wild. They're cute viral-video animals. Agh! Come on! Come on! Everyone, these bears, they need to split now! Hey, don't worry. It's all ready for ya. Yeah, yeah. Check it. We're good. Wow! You fixed it! It's back to normal! Not quite. We juiced it. Whoa! Yeah! Running on 100%... Lava lamp, baby! We want to keep it on theme. Enough! Quit talkin' and get drivin'! Good luck, bears. Be safe out there. Yeah, but if you ever get in a pinch, just hit that button on the dash. No, no! Not now, man! Pfft. Ugh, amateurs. - Oh, thank you, guys! - Be safe! Peace out! Quiet! - Huh? - Aww! Ugh! What? Alpha Team, regroup! They're getting away! Step on it, Murphy! Unh-unh. Aren't you forgetting something? Agh! Go! Where are we? We haven't been driving that long. Hmm, looks like we're passing through some kind of industrial zone. It's all that's left before we reach Canada. Uh. Whoa, lil bro. Hey, uh, why are you speeding up so much? Guys, we've got company. This is your last chance. Pull over, bears! Oh, no! They've caught up to us! Hello, police? I was wondering if I could request a jail cell with a top bunk bed? Panda, no! Aah! We can't give up! We've come too far. We just have to lose these bozos. Lil bro, you up for the challenge? Ice Bear ready to do or die. Step on it, bro! Burning rubber. All units! After those bears! Dude, they're right on our... Aah, turn left! No, no, right! Drift, drift! Aah! Whoa, watch out for that ramp! Aah! Punch it, Murphy! But, Trout, there's a mean-looking ramp ahead. Just do it! Faster! Okay! Stop running, bears! You have no chance of escape. Ram 'em, Murphy! Aaah! Ugh! Aaaah! What do we do? Lava power. Huh? Oh, the special button! Let's boogie. Huh? What?! Aaaaah! Yo, y-y-yo, what is going on? Aah! No! Oh, no, what's happening?! What the sweet peas is that? Ohh, is this some kind of control board? I don't know, I'll pick the big one! I wonder what lava power means? Yaaaah! No. Pan Man, what the heck are you doing back here? I don't know what the buttons do! I pushed the big one, and it almost brought the whole place down! Well, push another one! Um, gah! Aaah! Just a second here. Whoa! Try another one. Uhh! Okay! - Aah! - Yes! We gotta speed up, bro! Ice Bear maxed out. Whoo! Yeah! Take that! Ha ha! Lava power, baby! Whoa! Aaah! Panda! I got you, Pan Pan! Aah! Grizz! Oh, no! Cellie! Drive steady. Uh, Trout, be careful. That looks, uh, dangerous! Panda, hang on! Aaaahh! You will be captured. Huh? Sweet biscuits! Aah! Oh, no! The bears! Aaaaaah! Aah! Panda! Grab my paw! Gotcha! Uh-oh. Murphy! Call reinforcements to follow them! But we don't know where they're going. They could be headed anywhere. Sir, this is Unit 21. We found something. I'll be right there. Hmm. Come on, old van. You got this! Oof! Aw, man! Now what do we do? Guys, look, look, look! Is that...? It is! Canada! Canada! Freedom! Acceptance! Lumber. Oh, what are we waiting for?! Let's run! No, wait! Let's stack! ♪ Hearts everywhere ♪ ♪ Up in the air ♪ ♪ Me and you ♪ ♪ Oh, is it true? ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ La-a-a-a-a-a-a ♪ Hello! We're here to come to... Canada! Ooh! Haha! Bears! Ohh! This is just great. You guys are gonna love it here. We Canadians love bears. See? Oh, and we love you, Mr. Canadian. Ahh, I am so ready for the beginning of our new lives. Ice Bear ready for universal healthcare. That's wonderful, guys! Just show me your passports, and you'll be good to go. Just show me your passports. - Uh, uh... - Um, we don't have passports. Oh. Well, then, uh, I can't let you in, then, can I? Wait, what? Whoa! No! That can't be right! Grizz! I thought you said we didn't need passports! But... But... But I-I thought... Ugh! I cannot believe this. Please, sir. You have to let us in. I mean, we're bears! We don't need passports, right? Mm, maybe not in the States, but up here, you sure do. Sorrey. No! No "sorrey"! You don't know what me and my brothers went through to get here! Surely there's some way! Just let us through! No can do. Ohh! Then we'll just climb over, then, huh, we won't tell. Uh... Ooh, my poutine's done. Well, good luck! What?! No! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Grizz, give it up already. It's over. What? Ugh! Nonsense, Panda! I'll think of something else. We can just sneak in another way, or, uh, we can go get passports! Uh, c-c'mon! To the car, boys! Uh... I've had it! I'm over it, Grizz! What are you talking about? This! Any of this! Over and over, we get into trouble, you make up one of your schemes, and everything ends up worse. Schemes? I'm the only one trying to get us out of this mess! A mess that you created! This never would've happened if you hadn't pushed us into making that stupid video. Hey, people liked that video! Ugh, you are so in denial. Oh, I'm in denial, "Coolguy"? How dare you. Huh? Huh? Aw, see, now look what you did! Look, let's just calm down. Playing the blame game isn't gonna get us any closer to finding a new home. Grizz, how are you not getting it through your thick head? You can't fix this. We're not wanted anywhere. We're never gonna find a home. I'm outta here! Hey! Where are you going?! Come on. We gotta stick together! Stop it! We can't leave! We're brothers! No! We're not! We're not brothers, Grizz. We're just a bunch of dumb bears who made up some story to make ourselves feel better. Panda. Bravo. Very entertaining. And, really, it's the least you bears could do after being so easy to find. I mean, honestly, this was almost boring. My phone! And now you're coming with me. Welcome, bears! Ahh. The fresh smell of an animal reserve center. I do hope you'll enjoy our state-of-the-art facilities, including a new electrically charged barbed-wire fence. That's 10,000 volts between you and the outside world. What are you gonna do to us? What am I going to do? Well, I'll start by putting each of you in one of these. Wha... Aah! No! No! Hey, hey! Stop! Hands off Ice Bear. Don't touch us! Grizz, help me! Bros! Aah! Lil Bro! No! Lil Bro! Get off Ice Bear. Stop. Aah! Stop this! Stop! Let him go. So he can say goodbye for one last time. What? What do you mean? Why, we're sending the beasts back to where they belong. I don't wanna go! No! You monster! Trout? Isn't this a little cruel? Illegal even? You can't separate them. I mean, they're brothers. Brothers? Really? I don't see the resemblance. Well, Trout, I-I just don't... This case is closed. You won't be needed anymore, Murphy. Take them away. No! Panda! Lil Bro! No! No. Don't worry. We've got something extra special for you. Right over there. Aah! What's wrong? You don't like your new home? Why are you doing this to us? We never did anything to you! Why shouldn't I? Humans have been nature's dominant predator since the beginning of time. And this is the closest I will ever get to hunting you. So long, bear. Huh? Oh. Thanks. I've never seen so many bears before. So, they captured you all, too? Err. Oh, right. Sorry. I never learned to speak bear language. Err. Hey, don't be a sad bear! Wha...? What the...? Whoa, this place is a dump. What happened to us, dude? Uh... What happened? I messed up. That's what happened. I tried to make things better, but all I ended up doing is making things worse. I'm useless. But what about our lil bros? Don't you care about them? It's impossible. There's nothing I can do. And it's all my fault they're even in this mess. They're better off without me. I see. That's rough, man. But what about the promise we made to our brothers? Promise? What promise? The day we first met? We made a promise to each other. Don't you remember? When we... first met? It's still gaining on us! Aah! - Faster! - We're not gonna make it! Ugh! I got you guys! Phew! Thanks for catching us. We totally would have died. Like, really died. Ha, ha! It was nothing! Ow. I'm Grizz, by the way. Nice to meet ya! I'm Panda. Whoa! I can't believe we survived that! You were amazing, man! The way you came in, like, "Whoosh! Bam!" And... And you were like, "Pow!" And then like, "Sha, sha, sha, sha, sha!" Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! And I was like... And I was like, uh, uh, uh... Hey, I was not like that. Wow, we make a great team! Wait a second! Something... Something's coming to me. Hold on. Wait up. Thinking. Okay! I just got a crazy idea! What if we kept this team thing going? What do you mean? You know, like, we'd stick together, have each other's backs, and take care of each other. Like a family? Yeah! Exactly! And that would make us brothers! But we don't even look alike. I know! That's, like, the best part! Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is! Cool! I now have brothers! Yes! Let's promise that the three of us are brothers! For life! No matter what happens, we'll always be there for each other. Yeah, and support each other. Alright, "Bros for life," on three. One, two, three! Bros for life! Bros for life! Bros... for life. It's time we make good on those words. We made a promise! Yeah, no matter what happens, we'll be there for each other, right? Bros for life, right? So, what are you gonna do?! I-I-I'm gonna save my brothers! I'm strong. I'm a big brother! Ra-a-a-a-a-wr! Ra-a-a-a-a-wr! Ra-a-a-a-a-wr! Ra-a-a-a-a-wr! Ra-a-a-a-a-wr! Yes! Now to free my brothers! Fellow bears, can you help me? Sweet! Alright! But how do I get you guys out? That's it! They're all loaded up, sir. Good. Get ready for departure. Yes, sir. Huh? What the...? Grizz! Get out of the way, Trout! We're going home. You animals need to get back to your cages. What you're doing is wrong. We're family, and you can't separate us! I said, "Get back to your cages!" You think you belong? That you can fit in with the rest of society? You are nothing but some filthy, mindless beasts! - You're wrong, Trout! - Aah! Am I? Your brothers will return to where they belong, and so will you. Ha! What do you think you're going to do with that? This! Huh! Lil bro! Take Ice Bear's hand if you want to live. Aaah! It's over, Trout. No! Ice Bear full of rage. Your reign of terror is over. Get back! Get back, you beasts! These cages, this reserve, everything! You're doing all of this because you're afraid of what's different. Not because it's right. And we're not gonna stand for it. Huh? No! No! No! Let me out! Let me out! Free me right now, you animals! Nature has an order! Nature adapts. Maybe you should, too. Can we go home now? Yeah, man. Let's do it. Huh? Oh, man, this whole place is on fire! Gotta get outta here! Quick, we need to get everyone to the exit! - Aah! - Aah! There's no way out! Ice Bear senses impending doom. Huh? Do you guys hear that? What is it? Hang on, bears! I'm on my way! - Is that... - Officer Murphy?! I'm bringin' her down. Aah! Sorry, bears! I can't land in this fire. You gotta figure out a way to come to me. Aah, how do we get up there? Uh, what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Wait, I got something! What is it? We just gotta do what we do best. Oh. Yeah. Brothers and sisters, listen to me! Everyone! We gotta stack! Murphy, we're coming up! Roger. Hurry, bears. The fire's closing in. Come on. Hurry. You got it. I got you. Don't worry! I got you! Okay, hurry it up! Okay. Gah! Okay, now, keep stacking. Yup, faster. Help each other up. We are reporting live from the scene of a massive forest fire surrounding an animal reserve center. While workers have evacuated, dozens of bears are still trapped with no means of escape. Wait. Something's happening. It's... It's the bears! It appears that a grizzly, panda, and polar bear are leading an escape attempt by forming a giant bear stack! But the flames are closing in. There's no telling if they'll reach that helicopter in time. Hurry up, bears! Grab on! Steady. Steady. Okay, I think we're gonna make it. Aah! Oof! I guess you bears are good for something, after all. No! Don't do this, Trout! And who's gonna stop me? Hmm? Your bear stack can't reach me from there! Huh? Hmm? Sit down, Trout, and shut your doughnut hole! Hang on, bears. I'm getting us out of here! Everybody! Lean! Got it! Here we go! Hang on, everybody! Whoo-hoo-hoo! There you go. You're gonna be alright, sir. Hey, bears. How you holding up? Ice Bear is invincible, but a little sore. I can't believe we got out of that mess. Yeah, but what about him? Eh, don't worry about Trout. He won't be bothering you anymore. So, what'll we do now? I don't know. But we'll figure it out together. Bros for life? Yeah, bros for life. - Bears! Bears! - Over here! How did you pull off that incredible rescue? How does it feel to be heroes? Heroes? Us? Will you pursue legal action? Have you thought about selling the movie rights to your story? When will you return home? Uh, well, uh, I don't know if that's up to us. Maybe ask him? - Officer! - Officer! When will the ban on the bears be lifted? Hmm? Um, uh, well, uh, as an officer of the law, I will do everything in my power to make sure that the bears return home. One more question. Final comment, sir. Sir, over here. One more time. I can't believe it! We're finally going home! But what about all these bears? Ice Bear will miss bear brethren. Hmm. I have an idea. - One more question. - One more question. Hey, Officer Murphy, can you do us one last favor? Huh? And one special bear-stack poutine just for you! Oh, this is so cute! - Enjoy! - Thank you! Geez, I can't believe we have our own poutine special. Looks just like us. Ice Bear can't wait to eat poutine brothers. Ah, you know, things have really changed around here. Yeah, come to think of it, we may be fitting in a little better these days. Ice Bear welcomes change. Alright, guys, let's eat!
