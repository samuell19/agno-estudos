Help me, Lord. We can't wait any longer. Father! Please... Please... It's the Devil, the Devil! Are you alright, mom? Her heart, it won't take it. Father Michael, there's no time. Do not insist! I've already had the authorization. I'll be there in two days. If I don't do anything now, she dies. There is a protocol. A set of rules. But especially a training which you didn't finish. You could die, Peter. Michael! I have enough faith. Are you free of sin? Because if the devil finds a single crack in you, he will reach the depth of your soul. Of course I am. Peter! I forbid you to perform this exor... You are not ready, Father. I must do this alone. Help me, Father. Please. Come closer. The three of us fit in this bed. So you like to watch. Of course he does. I've seen how he looks at me during Mass. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name... Come on. I'm an easy girl. There's no need for foreplay. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in Heaven! Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those, who trespass against us! You've always desired me, Father. God, who from hands welfare established the most wonder... Ah! I will use in your mysteries and endowed with your grace, cast out demons and banish disease so by the sprinkling of this water, may she be protected from every barrel. Come eat my body. It's way tastier than the son of God's. All-powerful God... ...God of God, God of all creation, God, you bring power to your apostles to bring forth and pass forth dangers. You gave commands to your apostles with wondrous moments to do great things, and you said, "Drive out, evil spirit!" In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body! I'll leave this body when you come in it! In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body! In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body! In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body! No! What the fuck? What are you doing?! You fuckin' moron, let's go, they're not eating. Boo! That's it! - C'mon! - Let's go, father! Let's do this, guys. Manuel! That's holy water! God bless you, father! We're out! No more! - I'm sorry. - Thanks, father. Father! This way, father. What's the little one's name? Felipe. The rumors are true, you are a saint. He's in God's hands now. Felipe? We lost Blanca. All my children. Did you call the capitol again? I told you, they never answered me. There is no food, no medicine. No one who can lessen this virus. These are good people, Father. They don't deserve this. His resurrection manifests forgiveness, and above all, the renewal of our faith. We ask for the healing of our children, we beg Thee with all our faith and free of all sin. - Let us pray to the Lord. - Lord, hear our prayer. Peter. I'm sorry. We've lost four kids this week. Feels like a punishment from the Lord. You were possessed. It wasn't you. I let it happen. I was weak. I haven't been forgiven, Nelson. God hasn't forgiven me and I haven't forgiven myself. I tried to confess, but Father Tomás gave me a penance that I've never been able to go through with. He told me to confess the facts to the bishop. It's not the best decision, Peter. I haven't found peace. These mountains, Nelson. The church. The children. The orphanage. This is where I found my true home. And you'll lose it. You'll be ex-communicated, and you won't be able to help our people anymore. There's nothing I can do to help them now. Welcome, Father Peter. It's not every day you get a visit from a saint. Monsignor Balducci, I am not a saint. A long time ago I committed a sin, and... I've never had the courage to confess it to you. Come on, Peter. Please. You have been helping our people for 18 years. People here love you. And even in the Vatican, there is talk about the miracle you performed 18 years ago. Are you serious, Monsignor? But of course. The Vatican has not been blind to your work. Maybe you are not a saint for that, Peter, but only someone who carries God inside could do something like this. And I also know everything you've done to ask for humanitarian aid. But your prayers have been heard. This is a lot of money. This Easter will bring a miracle. You are destined to do great things, Peter. And from Rome, you will be able to help children all over the world. - The medicine is here, family! - And the medical equipment! No! I confess to Almighty God. And to you, my brothers and sisters. I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done, in what I have failed to do. Through my fault. Through my fault. Through my fault. Through my most grievous fault! Sir? You okay? Sir? Ah! Blood of Christ, protect me. Blood of Christ. Blood of Christ. Blood of Christ. - Hello? - Father Peter... - Who's calling? - It's Uribe. I'm the warden at the Sagrado Corazón prison. How can I help you? - We have a case with an inmate... - Is she sick? I wouldn't call it that. You want me to send my doctor over? She doesn't need a doctor. She needs a priest. She asked for you personally, she's running out of time. Good morning, father. Morning. Symptoms of epilepsy, hysteria, schizophrenia. She hasn't eaten in over two weeks. I don't know how she's still alive. - What are the charges against...? - Esperanza killed a man. They found him bled to death, hanging from a tree, his head completely backwards. I don't feel comfortable with this, trust me, we tried everything before calling you. Shall we? Keep your distance, she's extremely strong and aggressive. You can speak from here. Hello, Esperanza. The Easter will bring a miracle. How? Resurrection. We're five. Who? The children. What's the matter with the children? It feels like a punishment from the Lord. Who are you? We already know each other, Father. Oh, yeah. Very well. Stay back! I said stay back! I'm wet for you again. What...? A long time ago I performed my first exorcism. I swore it would be the last. Do it for the girl's mother. She's desperate, poor thing. Do it for me. Do it for your daughter. She asked for you to come. And she didn't even know you existed. I heard you spent the last several years saving lives. I couldn't live in this town with those memories. A few weeks later, I realized what you did to me. But who was going to believe me? Who would see the downside? It wasn't me, Magali. I swear to God, I was possessed. Look at her. This is her true face. The demon has never left. He's been possessing my girl over and over. Save her. If you really want to redeem yourself, expel that demon out of her body. ...the demons and Satan. God come into us... ..and who he has redeemed, at a great cost, the tyranny of the devil! Ah! Five children, Peter. We've made every kind of test. There are no signs of affected organs or of a virus. It doesn't make any sense. God will welcome him into His eternal light. God doesn't exist. Saints don't exist. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Good night, children. - Good night, father. Group hug! - Merry Christmas, children. - Merry Christmas, Sister Magali. Why does Baby Jesus forget about orphan children? You really think so, Camila? Did you behave? Well, I don't think he's forgotten about you. Yes, I saw him myself, and guess what? He left something for you under your bed. Thank you. Sister Magali? Camila. The inmates have suffered the influence of the evil one. I'm afraid there could be a tragedy if Esperanza's transfer to a juvenile facility... I mean, thank God because of the ineptitude and red tape, they haven't transferred her yet. You have all my support, Father Peter. The Vatican needs to approve... Just do it. We won't let our own bureaucracy do away with the life of this innocent girl. I've earned the Vatican's trust, and they'll approve on your exorcism. If you'll allow me, I'd like someone to join me this time. You have someone in mind? Father Michael. You made it. If I can make it to hell, I can make it to Mexico. Which, according to the London Times, is about the same. Well, Magali could have died. You too. Why didn't you want to do this exorcism alone? You're the greatest exorcist in the world. And you faced Balban and defeated it. So did you. I... I didn't defeat it, Michael. What are you talking about? Balban left Magali, but then he came into me. And then? He just left. Impossible. Balban wouldn't have left without taking your soul. The only explanation is, you expelled it. You carry God inside you, my boy. No! God! Open the door! Peter! Open the door! Peter! Peter! My child! Oh, God. She's fine. Thank God that she's fine. Thank you, father. You are a saint. God bless you. God bless you. Can't sleep? - Nightmares? - Hmm. Here. Mescal. The best holy water I've tasted in a while. Come on. Tell me your nightmare. Hmm. Come on. Tell me. I see Jesus... possessed by the devil. He comes for me every night. Strangles me, and... I can't even move. He wants you. Balban is trying to possess you. Two thousand years ago, he tried to possess Christ... but he was defeated. Balban is a demon with a noble lineage with legions of henchmen under his command. If he's calling you, he's not doing it without a purpose. You are part of his plan. Time to play, children! Tomorrow, to free someone who is totally possessed, we have to be totally clean. Fuck the priest, you fucking whore! I condemn you back to hell! I expel you in the name of God, the Father... ...Christ the Savior, and the Holy Spirit! I condemn you back to hell! It's OK, don't worry. Faith, Camila. Faith. What the fuck is this, Peter? It's a third-world prison. I don't know whether I should spray holy water or bleach. My friends. They're sick. It's your fault, Father. Your fault. I'll take them! I'll burn your damn children down here! Not if I expel you first. Silence. Don't fall for her tricks. So... you're from "down there." Prove it. Come on, prove it. Well, gentlemen, we have no demon. No possession. Let's go get a drink. Someone must have a mescal in this shitty prison. - Open up! - What's wrong? Simple telekinesis. I've seen that in village... Father, are you okay? Even if you were a demon... you'd be the lowliest kind. So simple, so predictable, that I would leave you to rot with your cheap tricks. We have a pact, Father Michael. In an hour, we will be raping you down here. Save me, Michelangelo! Please, save me! If my nephew dies, it will be your fault! No! The inmates... God, creator and defender of humankind, turn your eyes to this servant, Esperanza Valasquez, whom you have redeemed... A tree is known by its fruit. ...to make her strong for the fight, and to defend her with this powerful protection. ...with his blood... He kept in captivity... the devil! Hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, they will be done... Hyah! Are you okay? Killed it. Here you can do whatever you want, we don't use this place anymore. We need everyone to leave. The prison must be empty except for Esperanza and us. Your mother, just in case! - How many inmates are here? - Thirteen. And four in maximum security, plus the possessed one. Mr Uribe, we need to get them out of here. - Everyone must leave. - No, sir, that's impossible. You saw it yourself, it's dangerous for them, and for us. I don't know how things work in your country, but it's different here, and I don't want any trouble! The inmates stay put, and so does my guard. I can put them to sleep. Our prayers... they didn't hurt it. Balban is the demon of deceit. You cannot believe anything that comes from it. Not even what it tells you about me. It will always play with our biggest fears. And even as it agonizes, it will make us believe it is still strong. It is the best weapon to destroy our faith. And, above all things, never make a deal with it. If you do, he will always win. Demons reject holy water. This will make it float around the room. making it impossible for Balban to jump from one body to the next. I bet it's new. Doesn't have the Vatican seal of approval. Peter, the conventional ritual will not work against Balban. For centuries, the Church has used the same ritual in exorcisms. But the devil's not a fool. He's learned. He won't fall twice for the same trick. That's human. What has the Vatican done? Perfect the ritual? Plan a strategy through time? No. They send us into battle, but they leave us alone. Sometimes, I think the devil's in the Vatican's own ranks. - Michael, that... - Shh! The consequence of this is the auteur exorcism. Each priest performs the exorcism as he wants. The problem is, many faithless priests hesitate. And that makes the demon stronger. Michael, I... use that ritual. And only God and the devil know why you're not dead. But without a ritual... how will I do it? By not believing God is with you... but by believing you are God. She wants to be an astronaut. Or a film director. She didn't pick easy ones. She's obsessive. When she wants something, she doesn't give up. She... She goes on and on, and you want to kill her. But at the end, she always gets what she wants. I've never met her and my heart is already hers. Magali, I'm sorry. Forgive me. - I was hard on you. - No. I let it in, Magali. I fell for its temptation. I had you in my arms, and kissed you, and... Shh. I thank God it happened. If not, I wouldn't have her. My gift. My miracle. My Esperanza (hope). For many years... I couldn't accept that... very deep down... I was falling in love with you without realizing. I'm sorry. Every door is secured. - We'll be here in the morning. - Alright. God bless you, father. Father... save her. I swear to God. Shit, Peter, I hope you spoke to God last night. Where is the guard? May God be with you. And with your spirit. - He wants to kill my children. - Silence. I told you, you can't believe anything from it. It's just trying to scare you. Peter! Nelson! Nelson! You're going to be okay. You're going to be all right. Run. Stay back, Satan! Dear merciful God, the prayer of the Blessed Virgin Mary! Dying on the cross. Just the head of ancient serpents. I declare you anathema, Satan. Enemy of human salvation. And entrusted to his mother. Omen has a son! St. Michael. Archangel. Prince of heaven... Fair trial sentenced your pride and your envy... Go back to hell! Go back to hell! No! No! Michael! Come on! Ah! - You all right? - Yes! Yes! Run! You okay? What...? You lied to me! What are you talking about? Your prayer, it didn't work. What sin are you carrying with you? Speak! Esperanza. Eighteen years ago... She's your daughter. God, Peter, what have you done? It wasn't me. I was possessed. It was Balban. - Your sin let him in! - It wasn't me! I told you, you weren't ready. - What did you want me to do? - What about confessing? God would have forgiven you! I did. I confessed. But I couldn't fulfill my penance. Now you'll never be able to defeat Balban or save the children or your daughter! You can do it. You can exorcise them. You defeated Balban once. Peter, Balban didn't lie. In order to save the possessed child, I had to make a deal with him. I sold my soul to him and lost all power over him. They're waiting for me, Peter. When I die... I'm going to burn in... - Stand up. - No, no, no. Stand. I'm sorry. Stand up! Stand up! Peter... Balban will tempt you by using your biggest weakness. But you already know the only rule. Don't make a deal with him. There is no place for God and the devil in the same body. Always remember that. Let me go. No, no, no, no. I'm Father Peter. Peter Williams. Eighteen years ago, while I performed an exorcism... on Magali Valasquez, I... was tempted by Balban. And I was... dominated by own feelings, and... my forbidden desires for her. So... I broke my vows with God... and Balban took advantage of this to possess me and sexually abuse her. The fruit of this sin is that her... daughter, Esperanza... my daughter. I destroyed the videotape that proves my crime, but this confession will help justice to be served on Earth, as in heaven. God doesn't exist. Saints don't exist. Save her. Stay back, Satan! Under the Almighty's authority, I command you to leave these daughters of God. God is inside. Jesus is inside and the Holy Spirit is inside. Kneel before God! It is God who commands you. The Holy Spirit commands you. The church, the virgin, the saints, and the archangels... The Easter will bring a miracle. Resurrection of the possessed messiah. Our Father walks in hell. Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in hell! Lead us into temptation and deliver us towards evil. Amen. God is within me. And that's why I'm going to take him out of you. Satan lo made the eternal torment of sin sprout from the darkness in order to destroy mankind. Listen to our prayers with all thy wickedness, and infuse all thy power in this blood! By serving thy purpose, the sanctity of the angels is averted. Bringing upon doubt, the seed of all sin. God, leave this body! No! In the name of Satan, I command you to leave this man's body! Ah! Father, Son, the Holy Spirit, do not forsake me... ...and the divine justice, for evil... The nine circles of hell command you! Darkness commands you! Leave the soul of this innocent girl. The power of Christ compels you! - The Holy Spirit commands you! - Sin commands you! The flames of purgatory command you! - Father in heaven commands you! - Sin commands you! Free my daughter now. Lucifer's slave. Our daughter. Let me in! Let me in! God Almighty, origin of our soul and of our life, bestow your blessing on this woman! Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with me. In the name of God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, I command you to leave my daughter, Esperanza. Okay, okay, okay. I'll do it. But you just need to consider something before... No. If you expel me, they all come with me to hell. No! Time to make a choice, Father Peter. You daughter... or all those innocent children of God. No, damn you, you son of a bitch! Your daughter or the children. Decide now. No. No, no. What do you want? What do you want? I want you to let God exit your body. If you do it, all your children will be saved. And you'll save my daughter too? I will free Esperanza and all the children. Deal. Let the will of the Lord be done. Thank you, Father. You're a true saint. Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers or perverts, nor sodomites or homosexuals, nor thieves, drunks, swindlers, or slanderers, none of them will inherit the kingdom of God. The whole world is talking about Peter Williams, the gringo priest who cured 112 sick children, by just placing his hands on top of them. Are we in the presence of a living saint? May God be with you, God bless you. May God be with you. The video? I deleted it. Our confession is bound by the sacred seal. Your actions reached important ears. There's a job as a special counselor waiting for you at the Vatican. This way. Bless me, father. May God be with you. And with your spirit. Thank you. Glory be thy honor, Prince Balban... for defeating the man who would have become a living saint. The priest sacrificed God to save his daughter and the children. The way I see it, he is a living saint. Heaven's played its cards too. How did I not see that coming? We'll take care of God's new chosen one later on. No, the evil ones will not inherit the kingdom of God. They will inherit the earth.
