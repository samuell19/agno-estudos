OFFICER WITH A ROSE Because bright future is not a dream only for fighters and suffering people. It is here in our happiness and freedom. On people's army flags, in our citizens' smiles, in the happy tears of all patriots, in our determination to build better and more equal tomorrow. May you be in good health, my lady. - Goodbye, Vladek. Who is it? - National authorities! Open the door! Matilda Ivancic? - Yes. - You're coming with me. It is determined, that as a collaborationist is responsible for deaths of two patriots. We'll confiscate all of his belongings. Take him away. Matilda Ivancic! Why are you waiting? You're free to go! Yes? It is! Block it! I said block it! ... is send to force labor in duration of 6 months. All of his belongings are to be temporary confiscated. - Why? I hope I'll get an explanation! Collaborating with the occupant! - Collaborating in what? Since October 1942. engineer Neven Ivancic and his wife were often visited by a German officer Dietrich Fiddler. On 7th of February 1945. engineer Ivancic is leaving with the Gestapo. Fiddler continues to visit Matilda Ivancic until the occupants escape from Zagreb. Neven didn't leave with the Gestapo! He was taken away by them! Mister Fiddler was my husband's college friend. They studied architecture in Leipzig. Aren't you familiar... - We're familiar! Tomislav Seglic! Go home, take your personal belongings and report to the guard by 8 this evening. Don't not show up, or run away! It is determined, that as a collaborationist On November 3rd 1942, participated in shooting of imprisoned partisans. Take him away. I didn't run away, I'll report on time. It's only past 7. It's not about that. Can I come in? Come in. Violin? - Violoncello - That's all the same to me. What do you want? I'm listening. - I checked information about your husband. Neven Ivancic was one of our illegal agents during the occupation and with other patriots he gave his life for the freedom. Did you want to tell me that this morning? - Yes. - So why didn't you? I'm not used to be interrupted in the middle of sentence. You're an unusual woman, comrade Ivancic. So the verdict is canceled? You came to tell me that. - No, the guard would do that. I came to apologize. Do you want something to drink? - Alright, but quickly. Is that the painting of your husband? - Yes. How old was he then? - 25. Like I am now. There are exceptions among you, we know to appreciate that. Who painted it? - One of his friends in Leipzig, during college. Maybe there are honest ones among them, I mean Germans, but a few. What was this drink? - An old cognac. You should drink it drop by drop. We don't have the time for drop by drop. You would've taken this with you too? - Please, don't touch my personal belongings. You were appointed to work in the field, in the mud up to your knees. Rubber boots would've been more suitable. I'm going, they're waiting for me downstairs. Do you have food? Are you hungry? - I'm asking are you hungry, do you have enough food? There's a few things. - From where? Well, I'm managing somehow. Smuggling and black market are history. We're organizing national kitchens. Your husband has put people's authority in debt, so if you need anything, let me know. My name is Horvat, Lieutenant Petar Horvat. Comrade! Comrade? Thank God I've heard you, I'd have to sleep in front all night. Wait until I get my suitcase, someone might steel it. That's all I have. I had troubles finding you, despite detail instructions. There's no wood I can't find a way in, but I can just wonder in city this big. My name is Ljiljana Matic. - Matilda Ivancic. What hand you have, comrade Ivancic, and look at the nails! Look at mine, I bite them because I was nervous. - Please, tell me, why did you come? Who sent you here? - I'll explain everything to you, but please give me a glass of water, I'm very thirsty. I had a whole can of salted beef for lunch. To die of thirst. - Do you want another one? - No. Let's be on first name basis from the start. In fact, you can do that with me, but I'll speak to you with more respect. You're much older than I am. How old are you? - 29. I'm 18. You're almost old enough to be my mother. Girls in my villages are becoming mothers with 15 years. Do you have children? - I don't. Maybe it can be too late for you. - You didn't tell me who sent you. About 100 comrades were in some building, but that had to be cleared for wounded men. So they're are sending us to citizens. - Who assigned you to come here? You should've get 4 more girls. You have a lot of room and you're on of ours. We know who was your husband. Then comrade Horvat arranged that you only have me. - Lieutenant Horvat? Why only you? - I suppose to prevent all those girls to be on your burden. Six of us in one room, there were fights. But the two of us will get along like sisters, won't we? Let me show you your room. You don't like it? - I have nothing to like or dislike. But me alone in this big room... The whole battalion could stay here. Don't be mad, but I'm not used to. Do you have anything smaller? Now, this is great! But this is a girl's room. - Well I'm a girl. I meant, a room for a maid. - But you don't have a maid now, right? I don't. - Then I can stay here. But there's no power here, installations are broken. - I can use the kerosene lamp. I don't have it, just candles. - That's even better! I'll bring you sheets and a few hangers. I have nothing that can be wrinkled. Am I bothering you? - Why should you bother me? What's that plant? - Palm. I saw that on some picture, in one destroyed school in Vakuf. It wasn't Vakuf, it was Mrkonjic Grad. But those were big ones. Will this one get that big? - Maybe. I'd like to see the sea so much. Can I take this? - Of course. Why do you need it? For bathing. - I have a bathroom, use the bathtub. I'm used to washbowl. It's in my blood to save the water. We cherished it as medicine at home. We had to walk for it for half an hour. That thing with the read is hot water? - Wash the bowl first, it's dusty. I like it. I have a gift for music. I sang the best at military shows. You won't catch a cold? Me to catch a cold? How many times I've slept in the snow without even sneezing. Tell me, how do you like them? They're nice. - They're quite big. They grew like this only this year. I was flat like a boy before. Other girls teased me. Such embarrassment. I didn't flush the toilet. - That's usually done. - I know. You forgot the washbowl. - I'm so abstracted. I'm going to course tonight. They'll check our SHPB history and I know nothing. You know, I'm in SKOJ for two years, but maybe now they'll let me join the party. Will you give me one key so I don't wake you if I come late? - Of course. Good morning, comrade Lieutenant! - Good morning, comrade Ivancic. And what is so funny? Never in my life I found an unknown naked man in my bathroom. Is that so? You know what, comrade Ivancic, My friend Joza Skroflin, proletarian of Zagreb live with his three children in a room much smaller than your bathroom! What are you saying? - I'm saying that world like this was wrong and that we'll change it! Did you declare my bathroom people's already? - We will, if there's need. When you do something illegal, at least don't leave traces. You know what, comrade Ivancic? - You can call me Matilda. Don't be mad, but I'm sick of that name. That's the name we used for 8 Kraut's bunkers on Syrmian Front. Matilda 1, Matilda 2... Those Matilda's sucked our blood. Half of my battalion died. Imagine, comrade Ivancic... - I'll make breakfast. After I take a shower. - Let me ask you something, comrade Ivancic. Why did you send Ljiljana in girl's room? - What do you mean? You heard my question. This is your apartment, she did come without your approval, she is poor and uneducated, but she doesn't belong in maid's room. As a person she's worth as much as you, and politically, much more. I offered her a room bigger an better than mine, she refused, she wanted that room. You accused me wrongly once, Lieutenant, don't to that for the second time. I just wanted to check if she's lying to me to protect you. Well fuck it! Too bad, we could've used the yolk. - I don't eat from the floor. I ate from the hornbeam. What should I do with this? - What do you mean? I brought it for you two. Thank you, but I don't need it. - You do, don't be stubborn. Please, will you take that off so I can clean the table? I hope you're not mad at me for watching you. - I shouldn't be. You were watching me too. - You think that's the same? It isn't. You're much prettier. Comrade Ivancic, let's make peace like normal people. Why were the two of you arguing? We didn't, Petar walked in the bathroom while I was showering, so he's apologizing. Really? Thank God that he apologize to someone once in his life. He always comes in places where he shouldn't. Are you mad because he spent the night? - Why would I be mad? My mother would've killed me if I sleep with a man in her house if I'm unmarried. I'm not your mother. - Nevertheless, older women understand us girls harder. Do you want more tea? - No. - And you, Petar? Yes please. - Since when have you started saying please? - Don't talk nonsense! He surely told you we'll get married. - Of course I did. You see, he says that to everyone, and I still haven't confirmed it. Don't listen to her, she's just whining. - He's my first boyfriend, so I know he's the best. Was your late husband your first man? - Ljiljana! Can I clean the table and wash the dishes? - Thank you, I'll do it myself. Through the woods and hills of our proud country March the companies of Partisans spreading the glory of struggle! March the companies of Partisans spreading the glory of struggle! Please turn that down! - Let the cursed foe know a bloody war is waged we will rather die than give our land! - I asked you to turn it down! Let me ask you something, Comrade Ivancic. Why did you ask us to turn it down? - It was too loud, it broke my ears. I didn't ask you anything. Well? It was too loud. - You listen to your music much louder. Why do you care about that? You didn't answer my question. - I have nothing to answer. I said, you listen to your music much louder. I didn't know there's mine and your music. - Now you know, dear madam, there is! Do you really don't understand, or don't want to understand? You're saying the things you listen is art, right? - Exactly. But, dear madam Ivancic, maybe Hitler was planning worst crimes listening to your violoncello. And millions died for the freedom listening to these lyrics. So is that art, or this? We think it's this. And we won, you know that madam Ivancic. I'm telling you for your sake. You are one person, your husband other. You have to prove yourself on who's side are you on. Thank you for breakfast. You're welcome. Ah yes. It's sunday. Me and Ljiljana will go for a walk, do you want to join us? You don't have to. How do you like Zagreb? - I like it. Since always. - Really? Where did you live? - By the canal, behind the tanner. I don't know where is that. - When you go... Anyway, mine and your Zagreb are two very different things. Do you have any... - No, were all killed in camp. Because of me. Ljiljana, come on, it's enough. Madam Ivancic? Did you get my condolences telegram? - I did not. That's no surprise since they took over the post office. My deepest condolences. Poor Neven, to end his life in that way. Who would tell? A real gentleman. A bit confused in a certain way. Even uncertain, but a communist agent. Life is strange, isn't it? Can I congratulate? - For what, mister Gostruski? For a certain elan for life, a certain taste. Mister fon Fiddler had a noble ancestry, but a victor is victor after all. Who was that? - An acquaintance. What did he want? - Nothing. He offended you? - He didn't. - Then what? Petar, nothing happened. - What's his name? Does that matter? - What's his name? Please don't. - His full name! Gostruski, Franjo Gostruski. Franjo Gostruski. - I like to chase the ball so much! Will women in new Yugoslavia play soccer? - Don't talk nonsense. This is the last time you eavesdrop. What the two of you have to talk that I can't hear? I'm not your wife so you can order me like that. One thing to be clear, I won't report you anything about my duty! At least you can tell me why he's arrested. - Collaborating! Collaborating in what? - With Franjo Gostruski's trucks, owner of the moving company, in two occasions, jews were transported for killing. What could he do? They came and took the trucks. One of his drivers said he offered his truck to Ustasha's major. He just wanted to ingratiate with the powers, like many others! He didn?t know what he'll drive. Why are you pleading for him? I'm pleading for an innocent man. He's not an innocent man. - You've made a mistake with me, maybe you're mistaken now. Revolution never would've won if it's scared of its mistakes! Tell me the real reason you arrested him for. You found out about the trucks later. What was the first real reason? I wanted to know the contact of your conversation with him. What's that had to do with... - My job? None. It has to do with me. - With you? On what way? Did you arrest him for me? For you! Then release him for me too. That bastard told you on a nice way that you're a woman of easy virtue. You don't want revenge? - No. Gostruski told me he's in love with you, and you with him? - No. You're the only non vindictive woman that I know. Alright, I'll release him. Can I take some how water, I'll wash my hair. - Please wait until I'm done. I wouldn't wash it yet, but my head started to itch. I barely got rid of lice two months ago. I hope it's not that again. - Let me have a look. Everything's fine, but it doesn't smell too good. Of course, it smells like rotten fat from the warehouse. If you want, I'll wash it for you, I have some more shampoo. - Thank you. May I look at you? I never saw a madam bathing. - I'm not very comfortable. But if you want to... - You breasts are nicer than mine. You're imagining. I'd like to ask you something nicely. Tell me. - Can I go in with you? What do you mean? - I want to know what's it like to bathe in a bathtub. No one is preventing you, bathe alone afterward. But I'd like to do it now, with you. I was bathing with my mom as a child. It's not hygienic. - Why wouldn't it be? We're both healthy, we have no disease. Please. Bullet from the machine gun, went in and out. Luckily didn't break the bone. Don't tell Petar about this, he'd kill me. - Take the soap. Your skin is soft like silk, without a single hair. I remove them. - Shaving? Women do that? Petar would kill me if I do that. - Turn around and soak you hair, I'll wash it. I can last more than a minute. I dive like an otter. Is it hard for you to be alone, without a man? It would be for me. - You have nice hair. How was your late husband in... - You think those are appropriate questions? Friends can tell each other everything. - Are we friends? I'd like to be. Is my hair very dirty? - Pretty much. Petar is great in that. I know know how are the others, but I think he's good. You won't take him away from me? - I don't understand. I'm kidding. He hates madams. And the best thing is, he's crazy in love with me. What is so funny? - Who would say that one day I'll bathe with my class enemy? Am I really your class enemy? - Not as a person, but political, by origin. I can't do anything about that. - You can wash off your hair. I hope nothing bad happened to him. Where did he go? - I told you, mission on the field. What mission? - That's a secret, military secret. Shame on you! Hey, why are you hitting him? - He deserved it, he took the ice cream from the boy. I didn't take it, he gave it to me! Who gave you to babysit our orphans, you bitch! They're after members of some gang in the woods. He wanted to go. He can't live without fighting, it's in his blood. I'm so scared that I'll lose him, in this time, in freedom. Who's in there? - Petar. No one else have the key. - He'd never listen this. I was so worried. What's that on your hand? - A scratch. Congratulations on the wound, hero! What wound, some wild dog bit me. - Let me dress it. - There's no need. Then let's go lie down. Ljilja, what is it? What happened? She smells like your perfume and she won't admit it! - What's so bad about that? Because she's lying and uses stuff that are not hers! - You used my towel as well! I don't want her to develop bourgeois habits. - Lieutenant, you listened Wagner! Isn't that developing bourgeois habits? - I'd be careful what I say if I were you. Petar, you're immature and stupid! And you two are the same kind! You won't smack doors like that in my apartment! They are still not nationalized! Thank God he didn't kill you on the spot. I'd never dare to tell him something like that. Not to mention shouting. It's so warm. The sun warms it up. It seems that palm is growing. Did you really used my perfume? - Used? I put one drop on my neck. Yesterday morning. I can't smell anything anymore. Neither do I. I don't know how did he smell it. - Why didn't you confess if he cares so much? In fact, it's not about the perfume at all? - Then what? I'm embarrassed to say. - They don't. It's good you're embarrassed of something. You don't love me either! Ljilja, tell me, it'll be easier for you. We're friends. Are we? When I dragged him the room that time, I thought that we were going to cuddle. And he fell asleep like a log. - He really looked tired. Alright, let it be. But when he woke up we started to cuddle. But it wasn't good for him. Do you know what I mean? Then he started that thing about the perfume, like that's the problem. What do you think about that? As older and experienced woman? Nothing important. Little love misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? He never failed before. Everything will be alright, don't worry! Did he maybe get enough of me? I don't think it would come so suddenly. Good evening. - Good evening, comrade Lieutenant. Thank you. You didn't want to open because you knew it was me, is that right? Then why did you open in the end? - I was afraid you'll break in. When police wants to come in, there's no joke then. - Yes, yes. You know how to knead bread? This isn't bread, it's pastry. - Pastry? In these times. What are you celebrating? Is it your birthday? Ljiljana is being accepted in the party today. - She's to immature for the party. I know worse than her. Don't steel walnuts! - Walnuts are my weakness. Do you have weaknesses? - You can't make me mad, I'm in a good mood today. Rosenkavalier. - What? Cavalier with a rose, opera title. That's for Ljiljana. It's so nice of you. She'll be glad. I wanted to give this to you. Why me? - I'm sorry it's broken. An unusual transport. - How else can I do it? I'd died of shame if anyone see me with roses. Besides, an officer in uniform carrying a rose, that's not right. How about we switch them? What? - To give this whole to you, and we'll throw away the other. Tell me, do you love me back? They accepted me! They accepted me! Unanimously, without discussion. They praised me so much, I can't believe it. 'She's diligent, build up, hard worker, up to all tasks.' Did you hear? They accepted me! - Congratulations. Petar brought this for you. A flower for me? For the first time in my life. We'll have to have a toast for you. For your happiness. - May you be a good communist. I promise! You won't be ashamed of me, nor you nor the party! Let me tell you everything that happened. I could smell it even in my room. Petar told me you were baking it for me. I wanted to treat you with something. I had some walnuts. I ate the pastry last time on Christmas before the war. It wasn't this good. Too bad Petar won't taste it while it's hot. - Where is Petar? He left, he's on duty tonight. He was almost late. Won't you taste it? - I like to bake but I never eat them. Just like my late mother. So I can eat everything by myself. I'll simply choke with it. Wait until it's cold so you don't get sick. Just so you know, you were right. That was just a love misunderstanding. We made out nicely the whole evening. I'm going back home. - So suddenly? Nothing is sudden for us. The party is sending me. I finished my course. I'm useless here, but they need me very much there. Revolution is not over yet. Ljiljana, don't be offended, but I have so many dresses... - What would I do with it? I would only feed the moths in the closet. If you have some fine pants, that would be better. - Then I have something else. What? - First promise me you won't say no. I promise. I want earrings my whole life! I even pierced my ears by myself. - Let me put them on. That must be expensive as hell. You really love me. Holes are a bit closed. They'll remind me of you. Don't forget me. - I won't. I have nothing to give you. In autumn I'll send you apples from my garden. The best apples in the world. I'll be glad. Petar won't escort you? - He's in service, it's better if he doesn't. I'd cry a lot. I almost forgot. I'll write to him to your address. You know, I say all kind of things in letters. Someone could read it over there. Promise me that you'll look after him. I'll escort you. Goodbye, my pretty room. Please don't you cry now. Let me ask you something. That girl thing is late. Am I pregnant? - Not necessarily. I'm afraid I am. You're blocking my sun. I'm sorry, I though you were sleeping. I can't see your eyes from sunglasses. I was certain you won't come anymore. If I'm bothering you... - Can I ask you to oil my back? You won't finish? - After we talk. About what? - About us. Who are 'we'? - You and me. I won't be your mistress. - Let me explain. I won't let you. - Why are you pretending that nothing happened between us? And what happen, on your opinion? Love, madam Ivancic. - You mean... - I do. Please give me my glasses back, sun is getting in my eyes. I won't come again. - Ljiljana will write to you on my address. I don't care about her letters. If you need anything let me know. Petar! You'll be late to your service, Tell me. - I love you. More. I love you. Say it nicer. I love you. You're not asleep? - I haven't seen you for ages! Take a shower. - I want to wear our scent. People will smell it. You cut yourself. - A little. Sharp razor, German. Neven's kit? - Yes. - There's some writing on Kraut. Dietrich's inscription, his birthday gift. What was that Dietrich like? - Sweet, socialistic beliefs. After the loss they'll all became socialists. What was he doing in Zagreb? He was preparing some building projects. Are you still in love with me? Forever. You know what we look like to me? - What? We walk like two illegals on conspirator meeting. Promise me that will walk here every sunday our whole lives. - I always do it, you promise. I want us to have a child. What do you think about that? When I was imagining better future, I had no idea it'll be this nice. You were probably used to listen your music here. It was never nicer for me than now. It's probably because I'm in love. And I'm starting to like Wagner. For the same reason. - Are we agreed then? What? - There's no more yours or mine music. Is that my Peter the Great? - Mate, what are you doing here? To tell you the truth, the two of us came across, didn't we, Stipe? It is, comrade Captain. - We wanted to go to the command and went in other way. What are you doing here? - I'm just walking, listening to this. They play great, don't they? You see, the bourgeois are ignoring us. There's no a single gentleman to listen, just ordinary people, proleters. Say, come and have a drink with us. It's my birthday. - Today? All the best! I'm sorry, I can't. Alright, it's not an order. Captain Brkic, my commanding officer. We're like brothers. He accepted me in the party. - Who will you arrest now to find out why I'm hurt? I know, it was bad of him to pretend he don't know you. - Who pretended? Him or you? My God, you betrayed me so easily. You could've say 'We are walking', instead 'I'm walking.' It was just one word. We agreed there's no smoking here. What's going on with you, if it's not a secret? Where did you find that? - Where you left it. That Dietrich is quite handsome. How do you know that's him? You didn't know the whole officer club, didn't you? Why are you go trough my stuff? - I though we have no secrets. Do I have to question you or you'll explain? - I have nothing to explain. What his picture doing here? - I don't know. You don't have my picture, nor you late hero husband. You put Kraut scum next to your head! It was there by accident. - By accident? By accident. - Who are you screwing with? - Be polite, you won't talk like that with me! I'll talk differently, you fucking whore! - I loved him, understand? Loved him! You slept with him? You slept with him? - I slept! How could you love occupant officer when you had husband like that? How can you love a bourgeois when you have a partisan girl, party member? You'll catch a cold. - I heard stories about love in haustors. Someone might come. - You still want me? - Very much. You have mail. Your name, typed with typewriter. I have no one who'll write me. - We'll check it, comrade! - Of course. This was Neven's? - He never wore it. For us. - For us. It's for the two of us. From Ljiljana. Read it. 'Dear Matilda and Petar. A stupid is writing to you who needed much time to realise. If others didn't open my eyes, who knows when would I see. However, I'm not mad at you, and I still love you. Dear Matilda, give me Petar back, because he's my man and no one can love him like me.' Go on. 'Dear Petar, I know you love only me, so it's not nice what're you doing to our friend. I keep your three letters in my bosom and I read them all the time. I also inform you a happy news that I'm pregnant. Come as soon as possible to marry me, because people are starting to gossip. I work all day long like crazy, but I'm not sorry. I started so many actions that comrades from the committee started to brag me. That's it. Stay well, say hello to red Zagreb and to little palm on the terrace. With love, your Ljiljana. Take seriously the things I've told you.' Burn it to solve the problem to the end. - I have nothing to solve, it's all solved. You think? - Maybe she's wrong about the pregnancy. She isn't. - How do you know that? She though she was pregnant when she was leaving. If she thought, she'd tell me first. Suit yourself. - Even if she's pregnant, then what? Are you testing me or you? This evening started so nicely, let's not allow anyone to ruin it. Yes, I wrote those three letters to her. You wanted to say, love letters? You don't mean that... - Despite your fights and bunkers, you're a coward. I realize that every time and nothing. I still love you and... I can't live without you. Please, don't say anything, everything is alright. Don't sleep here tonight. Come back tomorrow. Nothing's changed but... Go now, please. Right now! Saturday at 12! You're still serious? - I even found witnesses. - How? Who is it? You know that typist in my office? She said she liked you from the start. And the other? - Her husband, Czech, winery owner, a good man. And your older brother, Captain Brkic? He won't be your best man? No, but he'd probably refused anyway. - Are your hands clean? Like the sun, look. Close your eyes. Give me your hand. It's beautiful! Where did you get it? Black market. - And yours? I gave it for expansion, it's too small for proletarian?s finger. I can't wait to see partisan wedding. - Don't tell me you'll miss a priest? He didn't bring me luck once, maybe it'll be better this time. Stipe, it's you. - I'm taking Mate home from his duty. So? - He told me to pick you up. Who was that? - My people. You have to go? - Yes, service. I'm sorry they woke you up. Why are you worried? Are you arrested? Comrade Mate? Comrade Mate, we're here. Good morning, Peter the Great! - What happened? What would happen? It's proper that you visit me, to see where I live. At 5 AM? You've picked a great time. Good morning, comrade Mate. - Ljerka, this is my best friend. I'm Ljerka, nice to meet you. - Horvat. Please Ljerka, make us some coffee. - There's no coffee. I'll warm you some milk. You see, this is my lair. It was filled with furniture, I gave it to the theater. It's not bad here, but I'm sick of all the noise and racket. Help me take my boots off. Foot suffers boots easily on the front than in the office. What do you say about her? Good looking girl. - Not good, but great! Great filly! Nice bourgeois kind. Caught smuggling. I'm holding her like this. She's eating out of my hand. I don't know if she's better with kids or in bed. I haven't experienced such escapades yet. - Is that so? But I don't get crazy to take her by hand to Zrinjevac, let alone to marry her. But some do get crazy. Are you talking to me by order or just for yourself? If the headquarter hears about this, unfortunately, others will talk with you. I want to help you. While there's still time. - Thank you, it's not necessary. It's necessary. For both you and me. Why for you? Well, for example because I'll have to ask you about a certain matter officially. What matter? - Why did you release Gostruski? You arrested him, interrogated him, you found out he's guilty, and released him. Why? From the allies. But not so good. Now you see in what shit are you throwing us both, without any need. Guess my next question. Who's behind me and whose orders I followed, right? - Exactly. Who recruited you and who are you working for? - Are you serious? You know why I released him. - Forget about the things I know. For military court it's more likely that you sold yourself to the gang than that your revolution broke between the legs of one bourgeois! I'm not afraid of the court nor jail. - I know you're not. But I won't give you away, it's a shame! And I love you like you are my brother. She's angry. Probably because you ruined our business. What business? - We like to do it in the morning, when I come back from duty. You see how I make sacrifices for you? If you want, I can lend her to you for one night, on revers. You won't regret. Thank you. I'm not interested. I know you're not, but I can't for the world understand why. I'm in love! Is anything clearer for you now? Well, the truth is, your dame is top class. I noticed that on the interrogation. But what happened to you to fall in love? There's no love for the common people. Bored gents invented that. Plum brandy with milk. My invention. It taste great! Do you want some? Maybe you prefer French cognac? I read the letter that Ljilja sent to the committee. What did she write? - You know how girls can be mean when you left them. It turned out you were seduced by the bourgeois way of life. That you gave up in front of the class enemy. Just think what would happen if everyone of us go your way. Communism and revolution would go to hell in a month! All victims of this people and party would go to waste. Class enemy skinned us without a single bullet. If only you hadn't wrote those love letters to the girl. If I lie the girl who carries my child, that means I lie to the party as well. Am I right? Listen Mate, no one has the rights to interferer with my private life! We communists don't have a private life. What I meant to say, feelings! And last winter when you shot that SKOJ member because he stole a pair of gloves? What happened to feelings then? It was hard to me but I knew it was right thing to do. - It's still the right thing. And it'll be for a long time, I'm afraid. Is that the better future for which you and me, all of us, bleed for four years? My dear Peter the Great. We'll bleed for another 400 years if it's necessary. Better future won't fall from the sky. You know well in what situations are we. The whole black reaction is after our heads. They're uniting against us. They're waiting for democratic elections. They can fuck off with their democracy! Your party is going in decisive battle for the revolution, will you leave it now? I'll never leave it, you know that. It'll have to leave you if you marry Mrs. Ivancic. I'm clean in front of the party! - You'll make it to consider you weak, to consider you as sold out and imperialistic agent. I'm a soldier of the party! - You'll be a traitor. Does Matilda means that much to you? I couldn't live without her. As far as I know you, you couldn't live without the party either. Fuck you, life! Our rivers looked like that. But you know that. Only we know that. Are you hungry? You're sick, I'll make chamomile tea. No, no, no. Thank you, but no. If I don't leave you I'll be a traitor of the party. A sold out, a weakling. Imperialistic agent. I'll be expelled, military court. I'm sorry, you're heavy. Are you drunk to decide easier? I have nothing to decide. - I'm afraid! You have nothing to be afraid of. You won't leave me? - Only if you want that! - I'll never want that. I don't know. I love you. - I have to turn the iron off. What do you think I should do? You want me and the party? - Yes. That can't go together. - It can! It has to and it can! They didn't offend and humiliate you enough? They did nothing of the sort. That was friendly communistic critique. Let me kiss, I heard it heals faster. You hands are sweaty! - I'm sorry. Maybe you believe yourself that you're a imperialistic agent. Matilda, I'm the child of this party and revolution and it'll stay like that. I'll prepare a bed for you. Everything will look nicer in the morning. - Matilda! There won't be morning. I'm going away tonight. So suddenly? - Yes, it's always like that with us. Suddenly. - When will you come back? I don't know. Forests in Lika have to be cleansed from the gangs. Groups of villains. Desperate people who are running away and burn... Please don't go! They're sending you as punishment! - No. Where will I write to you? I'll write to you. - Write to me every day! - Yes, yes. If my letters are late, don't worry. That's in the middle of nowhere. I'll die if something happens to you! - Don't worry, that's... That's a game comparing what I've been trough. - You won't forget me? How can you say something like that? I'm afraid. - I love you, forever. Why are you crying? - I'm not. Are you crying because you're leaving, or do you aware it's the end? There's no end for the two of us. Comrade, who are you looking for? - Comrade Brkic. They told me it's on the second floor, but I don't know which room. - Appointed? They phoned from downstairs, he said he'll see me. Andrija, you sent a comrade up here just before. Did Mate say he'll see her? I'm glad to see you, comrade Ivancic. Sit down. Do you want a coffee? - No, thank you. Karolina, two coffees. Can I help you with anything? My friend, Lieutenant Horvat, left almost two months ago. He promised he'll write to me... - Don't worry, he's safe and sound. I really miss him, he's a good man. I don't know why he didn't write to you. He wrote to me recently, a private letter. We didn't forbid him to write you, and we didn't confiscated his letters. I didn't say that. - You were thinking that. I'm sorry, I can't order him to write to you. Sit down please, coffee is coming. Comrade Ivancic, we have nothing against you, on the contrary. We're respecting you very much as a widow of a man who gave his life for freedom. You've completed academy of music, right? - Yes. But why? - Excuse me, but I don't understand you. You're selling your stuff for food and we can employ you anywhere you want. We can give you food stamps, packages. You can't live your whole life in isolation. The whole town is involved in people's front. For example, it would be nice if you perform on some show. Don't think I force you to do anything. Do you know when will Petar come back? - I don't know. Goodbye comrade Captain. Thank you for seeing me. ... has brought a declaration of pronouncing Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Millions of workers, villagers, youth, citizens, and honest intelligence are celebrating accomplishments of their striving and victory over all black forces of reactions, that wanted to go back as before... Who is it? Don't be mad at me. Comrades sent me to Zagreb. As a reward. About the ceremony of declaration. I couldn't not come here. - I'm happy to see you. Really? - Really. Then I'm happy. I never stopped loving you. It's so nice in here. I often dreamed that we're here. The three of us. You won't take off your coat? - I don't have the time. I have to attend on one more ceremony. My favourite. - Do you want some tea? I'd rather have a sip of that drink of yours, to warm me up. Don't you think it's too small for the seventh month? You're prettier than this spring. And you are more... serious. It's because of the pregnancy. And negritude. Bright colours look better on you. Matilda, it's not possible that you don't know! That they didn't tell you. - No one told me anything. Petar died two months ago in a fight against gangs. Second day after we got married. He stopped writing me. Luckily they told me where he is. I found him. And he agreed to marriage. I had a husband, so my child won't be a bastard. Why are you not crying? I cried for a month, like a rain! Can't you shed a tear for him? What kind of woman are you? Did you love him? Or he was just a fling for you? Leave. Please. I found this among his things. I wanted to know what's in it, but I didn't open it. I know anyway. I think Petar loved only you. In fact, I came to tell you that. I brought the whole package for you, just like I promised. I'm leaving! THE END Translated by Inglourious @KG
