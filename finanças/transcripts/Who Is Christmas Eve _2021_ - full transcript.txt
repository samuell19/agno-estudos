[Piano Intro to "Silent Night"] [Choir] * Silent night * Holy night * All is calm * All is bright [Baby Crying] [Baby Crying Continues] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [Baby Wailing] - Shh, it's okay. You're okay. Come on. Let's get you warmed up. [Choir Singing] Whew! [TV Audio] [Oven Slams] [Smoke Alarm Beeping] [Grunting] [Heavy Breathing] - Ugh! There we go. - (whispering) Oh my god. - Hey is, is everything good in here? - Um, no, I don't think so. I think I just singlehandedly ruined Thanksgiving Chris. Eve Simons, you did not singlehandedly ruin Thanksgiving. Do you see this? Babe, that's great! Look at those brownies, they look delicious! Supposed to be stuffing. Oh, um... [Scoffs] I just wanted tonight to be perfect. - And it will. You don't have to make a fancy dessert to try to impress them. Chris, it's stuffing. Right. I don't know what it's like to be a part of a big family. Or, or any family for that matter. One day, you will. [Door Opens] - [Chris] Andy! - Wow, it smells great in here. What did Eve burn this time? How do you know it was me? You really want me to answer that question? [Snickering] Happy Thanksgiving sis. Mhm. You sure the in-laws won't mind that I'm tagging along? They're not my in-laws. - [Chris] Yet! But look, but on that note, I'm gon' get the car, Make sure she don't burn down the house please. - Alright. [Mock Laughs] You okay? Aren't you supposed to be spending the holiday with that girl you're dating? Who? Oh, oh, the girl. No, that's over. Plus, I'd much rather be spending the day with my sister and her beau, than some girl. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? I don't know, maybe 'cause it's the time of year you always start to, not be okay. I'm fine. Really. (whispering) - Just-- - No, we're gonna have a good time. Mama! [Giggling] - And this must be Eve! - There she goes. [Eve] Hi. - How's it going pops? Good to see you. - Chris has told us so much about you. - Oh thank you. All good things I hope, um... Not that there's anything wrong with me, bad, but I mean, I do have my flaws and I-- I'm Andy! Hey! - Hey. - Oh sorry, um, this is my brother. Adopted brother! We both were, adopted. Right! Of course, I'm so sorry. I must've forgot. No, no, no worries. I know we look so much alike. Easy to forget. [Laughing] Let's go inside. Everyone's dying to meet the girl that mama's boy can't stop talking about! (whispering) Mama's boy. - Good to see you son. - Good to see you too pops. Um, hi. [Glasses Clinking] Oh hi. - Hi. - Hello. You know uh, could I see you for a second? About some guy stuff. - Guy stuff, okay. - We'll be right back, okay? - No, no, no, no. - Guy stuff, we gotta go talk real quick. I'm a guy. - Here you go honey. - Oh, hi. He is cute. Tell me he's single. - Andy? Well-- - Doesn't matter. He like kids? 'Cause I have way too many of those, okay? - Oh. -They're with their daddy today. He gets Thanksgiving, I get Christmas...and New Years, and the rest of the holidays! - Oh. Well...mhm. - Cheers! - Cheers. Oh my god. Forgive me. I was so busy trynna catch a date, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Keisha! Oh! Keisha, right. You are Chris' favorite sister. Yes! Did he tell you to say that? - Maybe. - Mm. [Andy Laughs] [Andy] Nice digs bro. I mean, Eve always talked about dating an athlete, but, a five time little league champion. Oh wait, not champion. Most improved... - Better stop playin'. I could've went pro, okay? Is that it? - Think she'll like it? - No... She's gonna love it. [Chris Sighs] Eve's life hasn't been easy and, you make her happier than I've ever seen her. You're one of the good ones Chris. [Chris] Thank you bro. Truly. You're gonna be next. To get hitched! The right girl's out there, you just gotta go find her, okay? Right, yeah. Look, I need to go propose to your sister, so let's go. [Chris] Come on! - So, Eve, Chris tells us you're a photographer? Oh, what kind? Um, mostly magazine work. I uh, have a studio downtown. - Well! - No trip to your boyfriend's childhood home would be complete without an embarrassing trip down memory lane. You'll appreciate this. - Here we go. - That's your wife. - Yes she is. [Chuckling] Awe, that's my baby boy! He was such a cute baby, wasn't he? What about me? Well this sin't about you. You bring home a new man, then it'll be about you. Oh, oh wow. Oh, he was so cute! Chris is still definitely cute, just older now. Oh, you two are gonna make the most adorable grand-babies. - Oh mommy, too much. - Don't put her on the spot hon'. I'm just saying. Were you cute as a baby Eve? Um, I, I don't know. I don't really have pictures of myself when I was a baby. Not a single one? No, um... I didn't get adopted 'til I was a bit older. Chris told us a bit of your story. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait now. What story? Keisha. What? I'm just trynna bond with my future sister-in-law. It's okay, really, um... there's not much that I know. I just know that I was abandoned on Christmas Eve, and left outside of a church. - Oh. - I was left with nothing. Not even a letter. Just a sole locket, here. What kind of mother, abandons her baby like that? - Out in the cold? - Ladies. - It's okay, um, I guess mine did-- - Wait a second, not the baby pictures mom! [Andy] I need to see these! [Chuckling] Actually, I was just about to ask Eve here if she would mind using her fancy professional skills to take this year's Fuller family photo. - Mom. -Yeah. - What? - Sure, yeah, I don't mind. Babe, you sure? Of course. Everyone gather up. Eve's gonna take the family photo. Alright guys, one, two-- Eve, don't you want to join us? Come on. No, no, no, it, it's fine. Eve, hey, I can take the photo. I'll take it. [Collective Encouraging] Eve come on! Stand in front of my brother, so you can block his big head. [Laughing] It's okay, you guys. Everybody say Fuller family. [All] Fuller family! [Glass Clinking] Ladies and gents, I'd like to make a quick toast. - Ooh. Before we all go into a full on food coma and get the -itis. [Laughing] Okay? To family. Not just the old, but also the new. [Chuckling] I think we all learned a critical lesson this year. That if you don't have the ones that you love to rely on, to lean on... that you have nobody. With all of that being said, there's a lot of love here. So much love, um... - In fact, um-- - Excuse me. [Ring Box Clatters] [Andy] I'll get it! [Keisha] Get what? What's going on down here? - [Chris] Where is it? - [Keisha] What are we looking for? [Andy] Looking for the ring! [Keisha] Oh! Oh my god! [Groaning] Son, do you want to finish your toast? Um, no thanks dad. Um, happy Thanksgiving everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. My mom was right, you know. We would make some cute babies. Oh, you heard her say that downstairs? Not at all. She just casually rubs in the fact that she's ready for grandkids, every time I call her on the phone. - Hmm. Eve, I love you. And I wanna take the next step with you. And before tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too. I do, okay? I do. And I want it with you. But feeling all this love tonight made me realize, I have this huge hole in my heart that needs to be filled. I don't know, before today I thought I was okay not knowing where I came from. But now it just feels like, how am I supposed to start a family when I don't even know my own? [Shutter Clicking] [Shutter Clicking] [Eve Giggling] Get this, get this. Okay, I thought you wanted me to take professional headshots? I do. These are professional. Get this one. - Okay... So um... are we gonna talk about it? Talk about what Andy? [Sighs] First, this. What is that? Have you been reading my mail again? You booked a photoshoot with DMC! The DMC. When were you gonna tell me? Eventually. You need to let me be a proud big brother once in a while. Andy, I'm older than you. [Shutter Clicks] - Yes, you are very old. Second, we need to talk about the fact that um... your perfect, successful, weirdly handsome boyfriend tried to propose to you yesterday, and you acted like you had just seen the Ghost of Christmas Past. Well that's 'cause it's November it's not Christmas yet. You know I have very strict rules about Christmas. And I have very strict rules about letting my sister mess up her life. Usually my clients aren't this nosy, and plus, you do not let me poke around in your dating life. Because there isn't one. There's, there's nothing. Nothing? I'm serious Eve. Sooner or later you're gonna have to wake up and realize that you're not gonna have a Christmas Future, if you can't let go of your sad, abandoned, baby Eve Christmas Past, and focus on your Christmas Present. [Phone Dings] Oh, speaking of presence, I'm needed elsewhere. But, you don't wanna at least choose a headshot? I mean, they're all of me, so, they're all good. [Laughing] - See you later. - You're an idiot. [Shutter Clicks] Smell this. [Coughs] My gosh, you called me out here for this? Scented candles? It's for Eve. You used, a siren emoji, two little ambulances, and also what, what is this? Santa? I put Santa Claus in there so you'll know it's a Christmas emergency. But honestly, I got you here because I don't know what to get her. [Sighs] Eve doesn't need things. She needs answers. Something that'll help her finally close the dark, sad childhood that's her past. That way you guys can walk arm-in-arm, happily off to the sunset. Or whatever, happily, couple-ly people do. How did you find your parents? Actually uh, I've always known them. Open adoption. But ah, I've come to terms with the fact that they're responsible for my uh, wicked good looks. And uh, not much else. But seriously. What should I do? I don't know if there's anything you can do. This time of year is just always hard for Eve. Well, maybe it's not the right time. I'll just fall back. Or... Or, maybe we say forget all of that, okay? And we fight for Eve's happiness. Sprinkle in some Christmas cheer, replace all of those bad memories, with amazing new memories of Christmas. Now of course, I'ma play Santa Claus, so I'm gon' need some reindeers and elves to help me out. 'Kay, yeah, I'll be elf. [Laughing] But uh, I'm not caroling. And I'm not sitting in some old man's lap and telling him my secrets. Maybe you start off by, finding Eve a Christmas tree that she likes. Something festive. Easy, done. Good. And I'ma buy this. I literally thought we just agreed that Eve didn't need things? It's not for Eve my brother. I'm a good smelling man. How you think I got your sister? [Chuckling] [Sports Game Plays] Nope. [Chuckles] Bro. [Advertiser] Search through adoption records reveal-- Wait, wait, wait go back. Go back! [Advertiser] It was dinner time on Thanksgiving, and most people were enjoying the holiday meal with their loved ones. But Private Detective, Pam Slaton, was hard at work doing what she does best: reuniting families. [Lisa] I always thought that I was an only child, and, then suddenly, with one phone call, I had a brother. [Advertiser] Using records and a bit of magic, Pam was able to confirm that Lisa did, in fact, have a brother. An older brother. [Slaton] Most of my clients are just like Lisa. They know they were adopted, but they don't have much else to go off of. Maybe they weren't curious before now or, maybe it's been eating away at them their whole lives. But they come to me wanting answers. Everyone deserves to know who they are. The people who come to me are looking for a, part of themself that's always been missing. I just help find the pieces that fit. That's it. [Chuckles] I know what I'ma get Eve for Christmas. [Knocking] Hello sir, I'm Chris Fuller. Is Pam in? - Are you a client? - Hopefully. Well we were just heading out to get our tree. It's kind of like a little tradition we have. Why don't you give her a call and she'll hit you up next week. Sir please, please, um... I know I should have called. I saw her on TV yesterday and something told me to drive here and just try. My girl Eve... well, hopefully my soon-to-be fiancee, um, she was abandoned on Christmas as a baby. She's kind of stuck. Can't really move on, well, we can't move on-- - [Slaton] Let him in. Let him in. Well what about the tree? Uh...why don't you go ahead and get it. Yeah? Just, make sure you pick out a good one this time. - You sure you're good? - Yeah. - Okay. Well it's on you if she doesn't like the tree I pick. I'll take full responsibility. [Chuckles] - Alright. You should've seen the tree he picked last year. - That bad? - Oh, yeah. - Come on in, it's cold. - Alright. Thank you. [Chris] Wow. All of these people, huh? Yup, they are all missing family. And here I thought we were the only ones with a crazy story. No, uh, crazy stories are a dime a dozen. I have seen everything. Trust me. But you know, the thing that makes Eve's story unique, that's you. Me? Tell me more about your fiancee. Eve... She's not my fiancee yet. But you want her to be? So this isn't just about her. This is about you too. You drove all the way out here, to track down some lady you've never met, to beg me for help finding her family. Now most people don't have a Chris. And people like Eve? We're really good at pushing away people like you when things get heavy. It's just kinda, what we do. We? So we're not gonna let that happen. We are going to get Eve some answers. [Trumpet Christmas Music] Ooh, you don't want that one. I don't? She's been on the lot the longest. Not fresh anymore. Here let me show you. Yeah. See, now that would be a mess you don't wanna clean up. And you, don't strike me as the kind of guy who likes to clean up a mess. I'm not but uh, this tree's actually for my sister. Ah, good brother. I don't know, this one, it's just not calling to me. Mm. You know what? To this baby right here. My favorite of the varietal: Plasticus treeicus. She's, she's completely fake? I prefer the term non-organic. Lasts longer, less mess. Pretty much better than a real tree in every single way. She's perfect. Thank you. - Luke. - Andy. I feel like there has to be a catch. Okay. But, in exchange for my spokes services, I would accept your number as form of payment. - Sorry, I thought that-- - No, no, no, it's fine. Don't be sorry. Um, yeah, I will take the tree. - Right. - You're all set. - Thank you. It's yours. Um... Actually do you, do you deliver? [Chris] Keep your eyes closed, almost there. [Eve] I'm gonna fall. - I got you. - Open them. Oh my god Chris, what is this? This is my attempt at doing something romantic. Have a seat. Thank you. And look, I know the holidays is a hard time for you. But I was hoping that we could make new memories. Good ones, me and you, together. This was a bad idea huh? I knew this was too much. - No, no. It's just this is, honestly the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. Wait is this, is this a proposal? - Nope. - Okay. This is me saying, whenever you're ready, I am too. Thanks. Alright. Would you like to do the honors? The lights. [Chuckles] Right, thanks. Eve's gonna love this. Well, glad I could help. Oh wait um, before you go, I should, um, maybe get your number for Christmas tree-like emergencies and, something like that. [Knocking] Oh crap, that must be her. Your sister? Her, present. [Laughing] - What a night. - Oh my gosh. - I may of gotten ahead of myself, but, - Mhm. I feel this is the perfect time to give you your Christmas gift. Tonight? Christmas isn't for another few weeks. Just trust me, okay? Come on. [Incoherent Mumbling] [Laughing] Oh my goodness. Um, Chris who's this? That's Pam. Your Christmas present. You got me a random lady for Christmas? Pam is one of the best private detectives in the business, okay? Finding people is her life's work. It's not about her! Okay, I'm sure she is very nice. It's the fact that you didn't even ask me. You said that you wanted answers. What if the people that left me don't wanna be found Chris? It's been 30 years, okay? I'm pretty sure, they've had plenty of time. Maybe they just don't know where to look. Or maybe they never cared about me. God. Eve! Eve! Look, I'm just sayin-- - I can't do this right now. - Eve! [Sighs Deeply] You got any coffee? [Mumbled Speech] [Knocking] [Knocking] [Knocking] Eve, I thought you were out with Chris? Did you know about Pam? Um, I don't think I know any Pams, no. Do you have somebody over right now? Of course not. It's past my bedtime. Okay yes. I knew about the investigator. I thought it sounded like a good idea. Okay, well it's not. Eve, Chris just wants what's best for you. Mom and Dad would've too. They're always gonna be our parents and, I'm always gonna be your brother. Searching for the answers, isn't gonna take that away. Not looking, not at least giving it a chance? You owe yourself more than that. Plus, I totally internet-stalked Pam and she's legit. If she can't find you parents, I seriously think we need to consider the possibility that you're a clone or a robot or something. Come here. [Sniffling] Who is it? - What? Whoever's in your house. Nice try, goodnight. Goodnight. What? It's cold. It's late. [Door Unlocking] [Eve] You're still here. If I gave up every time a client walked out on me, I wouldn't have very much business. You take all these? Yeah. They're good. Really good. When I was adopted, my parents noticed that I didn't have any pictures. So they bought me a camera, and um... I haven't stopped since. Look I'm really sorry for the way I left earlier. That was rude. It's okay. I get it, this isn't easy. Know how I know that? 'Cause you work with overly messed up people all of the time? Uh, no, actually, it's 'cause I was an overly messed up person myself. Mm. I know how it feels to not feel whole, Eve. I was afraid of what I might find, so I never looked, never searched. Luckily I also had a Chris. Oh, you had an overly supportive boyfriend as well? Overly supportive husband, but yeah. He hired me a detective for my 25th birthday. Wow. Care to sit? Sure. So did they find your family? It's a long story. All you need to know is, it got me where I am today. You know Eve, when I look at you, I don't see a mess. I'd say you had to work pretty hard to get from where you started to where you are today. The question is, do you want to do it? Do you want to take this journey with me Eve? And really think about it, because I'm not gonna do this search for Chris. I'm gonna do this search for you. I mean, yeah. I wanna do it. Good. But if you wanna find your family by Christmas, we better get started right now. - Now? - Mhm. - Coffee for you ladies. [Slaton] Yes, please. Thanks. [Eve] Thank you. I was just being nosy, you know. [Eve] I know, Chris. I need your DNA. Hmm? [Slaton] DNA can give us some good answers. What I'm really interested in is your whole story. Well, there isn't much. I was born and I was abandoned on Christmas Eve. That's it. That's nice necklace. Where'd you get it? You know, this was all was left with. Mm. - No papers or documents? - Nope. This is it. Well it looks real. It's valuable. Whoever left it with you wanted you to have a piece of them. What's inside? Nothing. I told you, I was left with no pictures, so... - May I? - Yeah. Eve. And here I thought you were named for Christmas. Yeah, everyone does. But I stopped correcting them after a while. The whole Christmas Eve baby thing makes for a better story. You know Eve, I've come to realize over the years that the best story you can tell is the truth. [Slaton] Now, I really do need that sample. Mkay. I can't believe you agreed to a DNA test. Chris sweet-talked me into it. Look, remind me one more time why do I put up with him again? Because Chris is a stable, reliable, boring accountant, who loves you and you, underneath it all, are a softie. You crave stability and warmth, and you love him. Okay, true, whatever. I'm glad you're going along with it though. [Sighs] Yeah but, you know I doubt Pam's gonna find anything. What if she does? What are you gonna do then? Honestly, I have no idea. [Low Rhythmic Music] I cannot believe you found this. Yeah. Now you have a picture of yourself. Maybe we can shrink it down and put it in your locket. Wow. Where are we even going? You know, I thought we were waiting on the DNA results? Well I told you, what I'm really interested in is your story. Your real story. So we are going back to where it all began. [Andy] So this is it? [Slaton] Yup. This is the church where they found Eve. On the doorstep, in the cold, in the snow. Like they just couldn't be bothered with me. Like I meant nothing. Well if you want to think a bit more on the bright side, every year this church puts on a Christmas pageant, a nativity play, a choir, or sermon. It's the busiest service of the year. So whoever left you on the steps Eve, they knew you were gonna be found. They wanted you to be found. That's more than I can say for a lot of my clients. [Breaths Out] So you ready to go in? Um, I actually think I'm gonna take a minute. [Slaton] Sure. [Shutter Clicking] [Light Piano Music] [Choir] * Silent night * Holy night * All is calm * All is bright * Round yon' virgin He's almost better than you. Come on now. - You're a musician? - Pianist. You didn't um, look me up or anything? Oh no, no, I did, I'm just making conversation. If I let in everything I knew about people there would be nothing to talk about. Wait...what else do you know? [Conductor] Okay, take five everyone. (whispering) [Slaton] Oh, she's coming. I'll take the lead on this one. - What else does she know? - I don't know. [Slaton] Hi, so sorry for the interruption. My name is Pamela Slaton and I'm trying to help my client Eve Simons find her family. I was wondering if you might have any memory of this. [Chuckles] I remember that night. You know it's hard to forget something like that. Finding a screaming baby all alone? So you're, the one who found her? No. But still. [Sighs] I always did wonder what happened to that little girl. - Well uh...there she is. So is this like, sparking anything for you, like, any memories rushing back? [Eve Scoffs] You do realize I was a baby when this happened? - The neighborhood's changed a lot in the past few years. Young families. I mean, the only other person who might've been around then is our pastor. Could I speak to him? - He's away for a few days. Won't be back until Christmas. - [Slaton] I see. Well since he's not around, would you mind if I took a look at some of your records? Proverbs, chapter 4, verse 25. "Let your eyes look straight ahead. "Fix your gaze, directly before you." In any words, don't try to go-- - Let sleeping dogs lie? Yeah, no, thanks, I know the verse. What I don't get is how preventing a young woman from moving on with her life is something that the Bible would teach. Well the Bible teaches-- I'm sorry I can't be more helpful, hm? [Slaton] Yeah... So am I. (whispering) Okay, these old school church ladies are never very helpful, but it's okay. I have a plan. How are you at distractions? You mean, you mean like causing a scene? - Yeah. - I'd say it's something I'm pretty skilled at. Mm, I could vouch for that. Great, 'cause Eve and I need to go downstairs. - What? - Now. Trust me. Okay. I got this. [Note Plays] * Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way * Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey * Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way * Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh (whispering) Watch your step. It's in here. [Shutter Clicks] [Eve] Um, Okay, should we really be sneaking around a church? I mean that's just a little taboo, no? No. God helps those that help themselves, Eve. At least that's what I tell myself. If they're not gonna help us find the names of the people who attended this church, we're just gonna have to find them ourselves. That is, if you're interested. Oh, me? Oh, sorry. [Slaton] It's the right year. Now, all we need are the 1990 membership records. Like this book. This is it. - Yes. Somewhere in these pages, I bet you there is someone who knows something about what happened to you and where your parents are. Yeah, and then they know who I am. You've always been you, Eve. Nothing I find in my search can change that. Okay, let's get out of here before your brother runs out of Christmas carols, yeah? Right! Andy. - Shoot. [Boxes Rustling] - Come on. - Whoo! * 'Tis the season to be jolly * Fa la la la la, la la la la * Don we now our gay apparel - That's enough! What? Those aren't the words! Fine. You can silence me, but you can't silence the spirit of Christmas, right kids? * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * Fa la la la la la la la la * 'Tis the season to be jolly [Muffled Laughter] [Heavy Breathing] Okay. Okay, okay. You looked like you had so much fun in there. Okay well, I hope you guys got what you came for 'cause I'm thoroughly humiliated. I would say, it was worth it. [Police Siren] Pam? Did you steal from a church? - Steal... - Wait, wait, wait. God does help those that help themselves. [Sirens Continue] Okay, I think that's coming for us, we gotta go. [Laughing] Hey. Okay so, like, what's our next step? I mean we're still so far away from finding out who I really am. That's for me to worry about. No, no, no, no, like, I wanna be involved, okay? I need to do this. - I would also like to be involved. 'Cause I'm nosy. [Chuckling] Yeah. As much as I'd love to hang out and play Nancy Drew... Um, excuse me, where are you off to? Another mysterious date? Something like that. Bye. He has a girlfriend? Apparently. You know, for somebody who is so loud, he has a scary good way of hiding his personal life. - Well. I just thought he was single. In my background check I saw he was single. Well, I hope this one lasts. You know, I hate the thought of him being alone. And what about you? What about me? Oh, you think you and Chris are gonna settle down anytime soon? I know he's ready. But you're not. No, it's, it's not that, it's just. The thought of me starting my own family, when I have all these questions hanging over my head... Do you remember when I told you that whole thing about God only helping those who help themselves? Well that's my next step for you. While I'm out, running around, doing my thing, I want you spending time with Chris. And how's that gonna help me find my family? Because it's not only about the family that gave you up. Sometimes it's about the family that's right in front of you. [Phone Vibrating] Well, while we are speaking about family, your DNA results are in. Okay. What do they say? Okay, don't get too excited. They're not exact. It looks like you do have a match. [Doorbell Ringing] [Knocking] [Bells Jingling] [Keisha] Hey! Y'all made it! - Hey! - We did. - Ooh, ooh, come in! - Yes. What's up my boys! Uncle Chris is in the building! We come bearing gifts. Oh, see, I knew I liked you. Jaden, Journey, listen up. This you guys' Auntie Eve. - Auntie? - [Children] Hey Auntie! [Laughing] Nice to meet you guys. Come on y'all. Show me the cookies. Cookie monster! - Come on girl. You're a lifesaver lending us Chris for the evening. It's not so easy setting up for Christmas without a man lugging your junk all around. For sure. Speaking of which, you ever give your brother my number? Um, he's actually seeing somebody. - Ugh. - I know. Well good for him. Bad for me but good for him. [Giggling] It's pretty. Mom, look what Uncle Chris found. [Keisha] A box of old junk? No! Our Christmas stuff silly. Like I said, box of old junk. [Giggling] Come on Uncle Chris. You said you'd help us decorate the tree! - [Chris] Okay. - Whatever. You ladies have fun. - Mhm. Do you, do you mind if I borrow this? You can keep it. Less clutter junking up my house. [Knocking] [Knocking] Can I help you? I hope so. I'm looking for a Heather Roberts. Does she live here? [Sighs] She did. Well uh, could you point me in the right direction? Where is she now? Lady, you're about six months too late. May I ask what this is about? It's about her niece, Eve. Her niece? Thank you. Your wife was a beautiful woman. See some resemblance to my client. [Drink Pouring] Thank you. I'm really sorry to hear she passed. I never imagined a life without her. - This must be really hard. My client Eve is looking for possible relatives. DNA shows that she would've been Heather's niece. So, any information you have about the family-- Oh I wish I could help, but, Heather was looking for family too. So you mean-- - Heather was adopted. Oh, she didn't figure this all out until after her adoptive mother had passed. I wish she had found you. Maybe she would've gotten some answers. I wish she'd found me too. But Eve still has a chance. She was adopted too. And I want to get her those answers Brian. Heather kept most of this stuff to herself. I didn't even know she had taken a DNA test until after she was gone. The only thing that she really found in her search... [Items Rustling] This. Open it. It's not even Christmas yet. You sure this the real Eve? Or some alien clone? - Look, just do it. [Paper Unwrapping] Okay, so I know I've been busy with work, and the search, and look, after what happened on Thanksgiving, I just want to show you that, I appreciate you. I love you and, look. I want to make new memories with you. Okay, you hate it. Uh-huh. It's okay, just put it-- - I love it. Say cheese. Wow. So you're the photographer now. I'm just a guy trynna make some new memories. - This document certifies that baby Vaughn, born on June 1st, 1970, hereby enters into a legal guardianship with the state of New Jersey. This is good right? It's a start. You know how common of a name Vaughn is. At least it's not Smith. Look alright. I'll get the coffee started. Okay... Here we go. [Piano Christmas Tune] [Shutter Clicks] [Chris] Awe now you go in there! I said I wasn't gonna do this. But you look so cute. [Shutter Clicks] I want Andy for Christmas. - [Andy] Okay...got her. [Jazzy Christmas Music] - Cheers. - Cheers. There go my brother. Look, chicks dig musicians. That's all I'm sayin'. 'Kay. [Chuckles] You gotta put yourself out there. Be yourself, ust make some moves. That's my brotherly advice. Go get 'em! Hi, my name is Pam Slaton, and uh, I'm helping someone who's looking to reconnect with their family. Did you give birth to a daughter in December of 1990? Okay. Thanks anyway. [Jazzy Christmas Music] [Slaton] Awe, I'm glad to see you've been doing your homework. You know, it wasn't even really homework. It actually reminded me of how much I really love Chris. - But, um... - But you still feel like something's missing? Yeah, yeah. Hey, what about that match you found? Well...she's your aunt. Oh, um... Well did you hear anything? That's uh, that's actually why I wanted to come see you. I met her husband, and um, unfortunately, she passed not too long ago. I'm sorry Eve. But hey, get this, she was adopted too. - Really? So wait, two people out of the same family can be adopted? Yeah, it's more common than you think. Now unfortunately, she was registered under a different last name than the rest of the family, but that's also pretty common. Okay, so we're at a dead end. I mean, we're literally back to where we started. No, no, no, no, no way. I have a plan. Don't worry. I just need you to keep the faith. Okay. [Low Guitar Music] Ma'am, the library will be closing soon. - Oh thank you very much, I'll be finished in just a moment. [Upbuilding Guitar Music] It's the same blanket! And the same hospital. How fast can you get me to Newark? [Door Closing] [Keys Jingling] [Door Opening] - Thanks. - This is what we drove all the way out here to see? What? Are you not impressed? You know, it's not easy to find out where somebody was born based on their baby blanket. I'm impressed with you. But this place, has seen better days. Well... let's just hope those better days include the day Eve was born. You coming? [Chuckles] Hi. Hey, I um, hear you're closing down pretty soon and uh, I need access to some of your medical records. I can't help you! - Sir, this girl really needs some answers. Need I remind you, it's Christmas? I don't care what season it is. These are medical records, they're private. You're not gettin' in. What about a Christmas bonus? You got five minutes. - Thank you. - Happy Holidays. [Low Ominous Music] [Papers Rustling] (whispering) Babe. Babe, come look at this. Look. It's all here. Born during the morning of December 24th, four pounds, eleven ounces, the article said she was small. Mother's age is listed as 16, this all tracks. Well, and her name? Nothing. Jane Doe. But look at this, the nurse. Maybe she'll remember something. After 30 years? [Laughs Lightly] Well, listen, we're running out of time. [Papers Shifting] What are you doing? Getting our money's worth. Let's go! Merry Christmas. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute! [Pam Screams] [Laughing] It's been a long time since we did something like that. I will sleep well tonight. Sleep? No, no, no, no, no, sleep? We got to go talk to this lady. The nurse? Babe, I'm on a roll here. Look, I already found her. She lives in Staten Island. Whoa, well, I am not driving us to Staten Island right-- - Fine. Oh. Okay. [Chuckling] Alright, alright, Staten Island it is. [Engine Revving] Wow. Guess it's not too late for Joanne. [Yawns] Good for Joanne. You stay with the car. I'll take this one. What if she's crazy or something? She's a nurse, how bad could she be? What the hell do you want? [Light Musical Riff] [Slaton] So you remember her? It was my first year at New Hope. I'm mostly dealing with drunks and husbands who fell off the roof hanging lights, but then in walks this girl. Did she have anything defining about her? Um, how she looked or what she was wearing? - Maureen! What? You want a name right? Girl told me it was Maureen. I spent hours with her once she was in labor. After we gave Maureen her baby, I was called out for a code blue. I ran out of the room, I came back, she was gone. Are you sure I can't get you anything? Thank you so much, um, I'm good. You've um, you've done more than enough. Really. [Knocking] - Hi! Good morning. - Good mornin'. I just wanted to introduce myself before we get started. I'm Eve Simons. You know who I am? Camera in your hand? - Oh! Um, hey, I had a quick question for you, if you don't mind. How did you get involved with the FELIX organization? I ask because I am also adopted. Oh wow. Well, I found out that I was adopted when I was 35 years old. Wow. - Yeah, crazy story. But things really got interesting when I started to do the search. I didn't want to do the search, but a famous adoptee told me the most powerful words that I ever heard in my life. She said, "You never start a book from chapter two." And at that point I was forced to go see my chapter one. Wow, yeah, honestly, I didn't even know if I wanted to continue, but, thank you so much for that advice. - Well go for it! You're not gonna be disappointed with what you find. No matter what it is. - Alright. - You ready to get started? - Let's do it. Alright, I'ma take you over. [Keys Clacking] [Slaton] Do you ever sleep? Who needs sleep? Come here, look at this. - Well who's she? - Oh, well don't worry about that just yet. Look at this. - Survived by Maureen Edwards, 13 in 1987, on her mom's side. Making her 16 in 1990. She has to be Eve's mom. How can you be so sure? I thought you said we were looking for a Vaughn? Well, here. [Pages Rustling] Here. Maureen's mother was Elizabeth Vaughn Edwards. Vaughn was her maiden name, which explains why no one in the registry under that name fit the bill. And think about it. Elizabeth, Vaughn, Edwards. - E, V, E. Eve's not her name at all. They're initials. - I figured that out. - You're a genius. [Phone Dialing] [Eve] Hello? - Eve. - Hi Pam. I think I found your mother. Wait so Eve is not my real name? They're my mom's initials? Close, they're your grandmother's initials. Your mom must've kept her locket and passed it on to you. She wanted you to have a piece of her. Something that tied you together even when you were apart. So then why did she give me up? That is something you are going to have to ask her. Maureen Murphy? She was born Maureen Edwards. Raised in Jersey near Union, now she lives in Elizabeth. This is definitely my mother? 100%. - Everything okay? Yeah...yeah, it's just um... It's never really seemed real before. But now, it's just-- - It's scary. It's really scary, I get it. I've been there. - I know. And you're the first person who actually understands what this feels like. I mean even Andy knew his birth parents. But when you don't know, you just, you dream. You know, about, what they look like, who they are. On one hand I do feel hope. But on the other, it's just like-- What if the woman who gave birth to me has three heads? - Exactly. - Yeah, yeah. But at the end of the day I can't force you to press that button. Only you can decide if you're ready. Do you mind doing it? I'd be happy to. - Whew, okay. Yeah. - Okay. [Phone Dialing] - [Murphy] Hello? - Hi, we're looking for Maureen Murphy? [Murphy] This is she. Hi Maureen, my name is Pam Slaton. I'm calling you today because I'm helping someone named Eve Simons reach her family and we think you might be able to help us. She was born December 24th, 1990 at the New Hope Hospital in Newark. She was found at the Union Community Church. Would you know anything about that? Hello? Mom? [Line Ends] It's okay, it's okay. Don't panic. Hold on. [Phone Dialing] Pickup dammit. [Line Clicks] [Voicemail] Hi, this is Maureen. Leave a message. Hi Maureen, this is Pam Slaton again. It uh, seems like we got disconnected. So, if you could give me a call back that would be great. I know your daughter would love to hear from you. Thank you. I can't believe she just did that. She really just hung up in our face. I know. I need you to realize this is not about you. This is about her. She's probably been thinking of this moment since she left you on that doorstep, and it's a lot. She's gonna come around. And what if she doesn't? That's where I come in. Yeah no. I can't handle this, I can't. Pam says she got this babe. Just gotta relax and let her do the work. No, you don't understand okay? Look, this just really got real. Before, my mom was like a piece of my imagination. She could be whatever I wanted her to be, but now-- - But now you get to actually meet her. And ask her all of the questions you wanted to ask. I don't think that's gonna happen. [Sighs] This was a bad idea. I don't even know my own name now. It's Eve. You, are Eve. No matter what happens, nothing's gonna change that. Huh. I think I know what you need. A drink? Maybe that too. [Pan Clatters] Okay, that's not even fair. How are they not burnt? Don't give me too much credit babe. It's my mom's recipe. - You know um, cookies always made me feel a little better when I would get anxious around Christmas time. \Maybe you should try. Here, there you go. - Look, I know you mean well but, that's just not how this works, you know? I can't sit here and pretend like everything's okay while you're making cookies. I'm just trynna help Eve. But I didn't ask for your help. And now I have to deal with the very real possibility that my parents probably never cared about me. They never have and they never will. I just don't get it, like, all of this, Pam, I thought that's what you wanted. Chris you don't know what I want. I barely even know what I want! But what I do kind of know is that I wanna be whole. And I'm just, I'm broken. [Eve Sighs] Mm. It still taste good. Mm. That's it. Maybe, we're all like this cookie, right? Rough around the edges, messy. But still whole. Still...good! Mhm. See? Okay, fine. It's really, really hard to be mad at you when you look like this with all this frosting on your face. Frosting on my face? - Yeah. You not gon' get it off? Please? - Mhm. Thank you. So annoying. [Knocking] Maureen? - Yes. - I'm Pam Slaton. I'm not interested. - Please. It's about your daughter. I don't have a daughter. - Yes, you do. She's 30. Her name is Eve. And she's looking for you. That was her on the phone. What does she want from me? Closure. She wants to know where she came from. Well I don't have anything to say to her, except that I have a family now. So I would appreciate it if she stayed away. - Maureen. Come on, she's your daughter. You're telling me you've never thought about this moment? At least tell me who her father is. And that way she can find some family in time for Christmas. I get that things are complicated. Trust me, I do. But this is a gift you can give to her from your heart. You can give her a piece of herself. Tell you what, I'm trying to help Eve but I would like to help you too. When you're ready for it. Give me a call when the time is right. There she is. Hey babe. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. Just came to check in on you. See if you're working hard or hardly working. [Chuckles] A little bit of both. Trynna get these edits done before Christmas. Well, maybe some cookies will help you focus. Absolutely not. Okay, I'm already distracted between-- - Just try them. Please? [Eve Sighs] - Fine. I swear I was gonna wait longer but I just couldn't. So, will... you... [Knocking] Um...babe hold on, I'm sorry. Pam? Well Eve I, did talk to your mother. Great. What is she like? [Slow Christmas Music] [Eve] When do I get to meet her? Unfortunately, she's not open to further contact. What do you mean? [Eve] So you just, you found her and that's it? She's not curious about me? Like, what I even look like? [Sniffles] [Slaton] Honey, I'm so sorry. But I want you to understand this is not about you. Pam you gave me hope. You told me that this was gonna be possible. It still is, I promise. And we're gonna continue searching after Christmas. Eve you still have family out there. And I promise you, as long as I am breathing, I will not stop until we find answers for you. I'm sorry, but I just don't think I want them anymore. [Slaton] Eve, please! What's this? What are you doing here? [Sniffling] [Quiet Sobbing] Eve don't do this. Stop running, okay? Don't let your past define our future. Chris I can't let you do this. I can't let you be with somebody who isn't whole. I love you. That's not enough? How do you love me when you don't even know me? I don't even know myself. I do know you! Eve, I'm not your parents okay? I'm not gonna leave. Why are you pushing me away? Look, I'm sorry. [Knocking] Andy I think I ruined things with Chris, and I-- Hey what's wrong? He left. What? Who? [Sighs Deeply] [Phone Vibrating] [Murphy] Pam? Maureen? I think I'm ready for your help. [Eve] Alright, no more secrets, no more hiding. Tell me everything. Fine. If you must know... I'm gay. [Gasps] [Andy Chuckles] You knew? Of course I knew Andy. Goodness, I've known since we were kids. Well. Thank you for waiting 'til I was ready to say anything. - It wasn't easy. Do you know how hard it was to keep a straight face every time you made up a story about having a girlfriend? [Laughs] I just don't get why you were scared to tell me. It's, it's not that easy, like, maybe it is for some people, but um, I'm very private. And so... [Chuckles] - Oh really? - Okay. I was scared. Now I lost the one guy, who I, actually cared about. What happened? He asked me to spend Christmas with him. [Gasps] Oh my god. I freaked! Thi-This whole commitment, baring your soul kind of thing scares me, so, I just, pushed him away. Okay well, look. If he loves you, he will accept you. Baggage and all. Speaking of which, what about your baggage? Mm-mm. No, no. I don't wanna talk about that. Come on. Now who's keeping secrets. [Murphy] Okay, goodbye. What is it? Maureen called. Eve's mom. And? And she wants to talk to me in person, about Eve. Then let's go. What about Christmas? All that matters is we're together. Spill. What happened with Chris? Just the same old stuff. He wants to commit, I run away. But this time I did it on Christmas Eve. Eve, Chris loves you. No, not after tonight he doesn't. - What happened to what you said. "If he loves you, he'll accept you for who you are. "Baggage included." Yeah except, we're so past baggage. I have a whole storage unit's worth of problems. Yeah no, after tonight, we're done. It's done. He's done! Maybe you're right. What? Maybe you will lose him after tonight. Okay. I'm not sure if you're up on the rules of girl talk, you know, since you just came out and all, but, you're supposed to tell me that everything is gonna be okay. - Eve, Chris is amazing. He's the type of guy that every girl. and guy dream about. He's handsome, successful, - Mhm. and he loves you so much that it hurts. And all along you've been chasing these people, like your birth mom that you don't even know. And the people who love you have been here the whole time. Chris is your family, Eve. At least he wants to be. And if you wanna find your family and be whole, you need to make things right with Chris. You're right. - No, I'm right. Oh. You think I'm right. Ha. I just don't wanna lose him though. Yeah, um, I'm literally already texting Chris for you. - You are? - Yup. Thank you. That's what family's for. No secrets. Tell me everything. It's hard. [Sniffling] I'm not-- I'm not proud of what I did. I'm so ashamed. It's okay. There's no judgment here. The only thing that matters, is that you tell me the truth. [Murphy] My mother died when I was 13. It's not like everything was perfect before that. My father drank and, my mother never got over the fact that they gave their first baby up for adoption before they were married. It was her lifeline. Her hope. [Sniffles] But it wasn't enough. After she died, everything fell apart. My father became distant and a bit of a drunk. I pretty much had to fend for myself. Until, I met Rodney. We were in love. He felt like, the one person in the whole world that really understood me. I thought we'd be together for the rest of our lives. Until I got pregnant. With Eve. I, I wanted to keep her, but, it was a different time. Rodney was Black, I was white. My father would kill the both of us if he found out. So... [Churchgoers Clapping] I did the only thing I knew how to do. I hid it. From everyone. No one knew. Not even Rodney. And when I knew it was time, I got as far way as I could. Eve was so perfect. But the moment I saw her I, I knew I couldn't keep her. So I took her to the only place where I knew she'd be safe. The place where Rodney and I met. [Baby Crying] He was the one who found her. Only he didn't know that she was his. I tried to forget. I... I moved on with my life. I got the hell out of my father's house. But there was always this, piece of me... That's missing. - You were brave to share your story with me. Do you think you have it in you to share it with Eve? There's, there's just something I have to do first. Go, go get your man. I will, but Andy? Hm? - You deserve a happy ending too. With-- - Luke. His name's Luke. No more secrets. Okay. He's, he's also a lumberjack? I don't really know what the longterm job prospects for a lumberjack are, but I just feel like it might-- Okay, no, no, no. We'll unpack all of this later, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, go, go. (singing) [Rodney] Oh come all ye faithful. Y'all get home safe now. (singing) Joyful and the triumphant. Aye folks, I'm not one to turn away churchgoers, but I got a kid at home and a lot of presents to wrap so-- Maureen? Hi Rodney. Hi. Long time. Long time. [Christmas Pop Music] What is this place? Apparently this is where I'm from. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. Um...look Chris, none of this would be possible without you. I wouldn't be possible without you. And I don't need answers to make me whole. Can you please say something? That's the most romantic thing you've ever said to me, so I was like processing that and also trynna process a better comeback line. Okay, okay, maybe just start off by proposing to me again? And I know, I know, I messed up the first few times, but, just give me a second chance? Lucky I keep that ring on me. I guess third time's a charm, huh? - Yeah. Eve Simons, will you marry me? I can't hear you. Yes, yes, I'll marry you! [Chris] I can't believe this babe. [Eve Squeals] Let me see this thing. How we work this, like this? - Yeah. Alright. [Shutter Clicks] Longest day ever. We clean up nice though. [Andy] Yes. [Laughing] [Luke] You sure your family won't mind me coming over for Christmas. Nah, it's all good. The more the merrier. - Mhm. - I'm just happy this one finally settling down. - Yeah me too. - Whoa, whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I don't think it's so crazy. You don't? [Yells Out] Welcome to the family. [Eve] Thank you. - Come on in. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. [Exchanging Greetings] I'm proud of you son. She's a catch. She is. [Phone Vibrating] I'll be in in one second pops. Pam? Yes! [Overlapping Dialogue] Mom, no way. I love it! [Overlapping Dialogue] Ooh! Okay. Okay. Oh, there we go! - Say cheese! [Laughing] - Y'all cute. Um, who's that? - It's a surprise. Come on. - Oh. [Chris] Come on. Chris, what's going on? I got a surprise. Surprise. Pam, what are you doing here? Hello Eve. Would you like to meet your parents? (breathlessly) My parents? What? How, how did you... Little luck, a lot of hard work and a little Christmas magic. Yeah, yeah sure. - Thanks Pam. - Of course. I'm so happy for you Eve. Merry Christmas. Hi, hi. It's really you. - Hi Eve. - Hi. Eve I, I know you must hate me, but, before you say anything, I want you to know the truth. I, I left you on those steps because I knew that you'd be safe there. And I tried to move on, I, I moved away. I never even told Rodney, but, but I never forgot you. You have to believe me. I do. I do. Really? Because I've loved you, all, all these years. And I've loved you since earlier today. [Laughing] No, no but really, in my heart, I've loved you since I first found you on those church steps. [Sobbing] [Rodney] Come on now, give me some love! Break this up! I'm sorry, do you guys want to come in? It's freezing. Yes. - Come on. [Eve] This is my fiancé Chris. - Fiancé? Okay. - Nice to meet you guys. It's cold, come inside. My mother's necklace. Oh, yeah I never take it off. It was the last thing I had left of her after she passed. So, when I made the decision to leave you, I wanted you to have it. So you could have a piece of her too. - Of both of us. - Thank you. Honestly, I wish I had something to put in it. There's something I have for you. Look here. After I left you, all I had was my memories. These pictures were precious to me. Oh. [Fuller] Okay everyone! Time to take the family photo. [Chris] Alright, yes. Eve, you sure you don't want us to take the picture? What? No, you're family, you're in it. - Okay...[Eve Muttering] - Of course you're in it. Okay, ready? Everybody say Fuller family. [All] Fuller family! [Light Christmas Music] [Light Guitar Strumming] [Knocking] Hi. We're doing presents in the living room. - Just a sec. You ever get tired of playing Santa for everybody else? Nope, not one bit. [Giggling] You know, you deserve some answers of your own too. [Drawer Closing] - Who knows? Maybe next year, Santa'll give you your own present too? I guess we'll just have to wait and see. [Lively Music] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
