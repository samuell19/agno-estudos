(upbeat electronic music) (Anne-Marie laughing) - Oh, come upstairs first. (laughing) (heavy breathing) (soft moaning) (laughing) - Let me take this. (laughing) - Wow, nice place. It's a bit big for one person, isn't it? - Well, but tonight I'm not one person, no? - Would you like something to drink? - Yeah. - What can I get you? - Anything. Whatever you're having. - I have some liquors that I bring back from Paris. It's very special. You like to try some? - Yeah. It's a shame you have to go back tomorrow - Yes, but maybe I come back in one month or something. - Yeah. - I'll go get the liquor, huh? - Glad your friend didn't show up tonight. - [Anne-Marie] You know, I'm so angry with her. I don't know why she do this to me. - You have to make do with me instead then. - [Anne-Marie] I think that this perhaps is much more preferable, huh? - Mmm. Oh, good paintings. Who did them? - [Anne-Marie] I paint them myself. - Oh, so you're an artist? - [Anne-Marie] Oh, not really an artist, but you know I try. - Well, they're good. Who are the kids? - [Anne-Marie] They're the children of my brother. - Oh good. - What sort of music taste do you have? - [Anne-Marie] I like all sorts of music. - Yeah? - [Anne-Marie] Yeah. Try some of this liquor. - Cheers. (glasses clinking) Oh, it's good. - It's nice, no? - Yeah. - So tell me, you like video? You know, to watch movies? - Yeah. - You like, how you say, film erotic? - What, dirty movies? - You like those? - Yeah, you got some? - Yes, all those over there. - That's quite a few. - Well, it's a little collection. Would you like to watch one? - Yeah, why not? - Okay, I'll put one on, huh? Oh, you know, I hate all this modern technology. It's too complicated for me, you know. (laughing) I just like one button that you just turn on. (Laughs) (upbeat electronic music) (woman laughing) - This is nice. - Here. To strangers and new experience, huh? - Yeah. (woman moaning) - You know what? I love your French accent. - Oh, all the men, they say that. I don't know what it is with English men and the French accent. - You have many men back here then? - No, not many, but sometimes, if they're special. Like you. (upbeat electronic music) (woman moaning and grunting) - Do you like this sort of stuff? - You don't like this? - It's okay. - You don't think it's sexy? - I think I'd rather be doing it than watching it. (woman moaning) - Maybe you prefer I turn it off. (woman in video laughing) (coughing) Are you alright? - Yeah, I think so? - You have perhaps too much to drink? - Where's your bathroom? - It's just over there near the stairs. - Ugh, I'm sorry about this. - No, it is no problem. - I'll be okay in a minute. It's just, oh dear, sorry, excuse me. - No. (slow, dramatic music) Off CAMERA We hear a Thump, Thump sound as his head bumps... ..the steps as he is dragged down the stairs. ♪ Always reminds me of departed friends ♪ ♪ Now as I walk with you ♪ ♪ No, we will never end ♪ ♪ India is my mode of breath, brush your lips ♪ ♪ I knew I'd kiss a dream I'd never feel ♪ ♪ I knew I'd kiss a dream I'd never feel ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Whoa ho oh oh me ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Whoa ho oh oh ♪ ♪ Whoa ho oh ho ♪ ♪ Touch is soft, days are long ♪ ♪ Fragile is joy ♪ ♪ Then he smiled, thought we had two steady love ♪ ♪ And we lost the strength, killed the love ♪ ♪ It was nearly there ♪ ♪ How strange those arguments we shared ♪ (dramatic music) - What's going on? - Welcome to the world of the living. How do you feel? - (sighs) My head. What's all this? - Just some stuff. I thought you might like this. - (laughs) Um, I don't think I'm up to this right now. I'm sorry, but. - (laughs) This isn't really what you had in mind, right? - Not really, no. - You were thinking sort of, more of a quickie, huh? - Why else did you invite me back here? - You were the one who invited yourself back here. - Well why say yes if that's not what you wanted? - But it is what I wanted. - You're not French? - No, I'm not French. Sometimes I like pretending to be someone else. It's so boring being the same person all the time. - Uh, can you let me out of this chair? - Oh, come on, you'll feel better soon. And then we can have some real fun. - Oh look, I'm not really into this at all. Can you please undo these straps? - Well, I can, but not right now. (Laughs) - I can't stay, I've gotta go! - You have to go somewhere? - Yes, I'll be missed. - Oh, oh, at the office. Well there's no one to miss you at home, is there? - I lied, alright? - You lied? - I'm married. Sometimes it's best not to tell the truth. - I don't think so. Don't tell me, children, too, huh? - That's got nothing to do with you. - Well, I should hope not. - Look, this isn't a joke anymore. Can you just. - I never said it was a joke. This is serious to me. Oh come on, let me give you a little massage. - I don't want a massage. - Oh, don't be so grouchy. - Look, I'm not into this sort of thing, alright? Just undo the straps and let me go. - You were the one who wanted to come back here for some fun, and I wanted you to watch my video, but you passed out just before we got to the good stuff. So I thought maybe we could watch it now, what do you think? - I don't think so. - Oh come on, just a little look. - Just undo the straps, will you? - Was that an order? - Oh, come on. - You mustn't order me around. - (groaning) Fucking thing. Oh, for fuck's sake. Fuck. - I think I'd like you to watch the video. What do you think? - (laughs nervously) Yeah yeah, if that's what you want. Please, please, put the knife down. Please, put the knife down. No, no. Look. You're an attractive woman. You'll have no problems finding some guy who'd be into this sort of stuff, right? It's, it's just, it's just not me, alright? - Oh, but you're just the person I wanted. - For what? - For my film. You see, I make films. Very special films. Fun films. And I want you to be in my film. - I don't want to get involved, alright? - You see Tevin, I don't really care what you want or don't want, do you understand that? But what I want right now is to watch the video. - Alright, let's watch the video if that's what makes you happy. - Oh, that's what I like to hear, lots of cooperation. It's movie time. (man screaming) (whip cracking) (man screaming) Oh, we're coming to the good stuff soon. Are you watching this? (Laughs) - Carla! - This is my favorite part coming up. - [Woman In Video] So are you having fun now? (laughing) - This is disgusting. - What? What did you say? (man in video screaming) - Just let me out of this fucking chair, will you? For fuck's sake, let me out of here! Let me out of this fucking chair! (screaming) - Help! Help! (screaming) (screaming) - [Anne-Marie] Now what was that screaming all about? No one's gonna hear you. The room is completely soundproofed. - You've got everything figured out, haven't you? - Oh, that rosy glow you had in your cheeks earlier seems to be gone. - What is it that you want? Is it money? - Money? (Laughs) I think that we had better get things straight right now! You're here for as long as I want you to be, and you can't talk or scream or bribe your way out of it. So, you just better do what I say, or else I'll put a gag on you. It is as simple as that. - Why are you doing this to me? How long will you keep me here for? - I will have to put the gag on you, I can see that. - I need to go to the bathroom! - Bathroom? - I need to go to the toilet. - Well why don't you say toilet if that's what you mean? Stupid euphemistic language. If you want to shit and piss, just say so or raise your hand. (Laughs) Well say it then, I want to shit and piss. - I want to shit and piss. Satisfied? - Oh, I've already told you you can't leave this room. You'll just have to do it right where you are. - I can't. - Don't worry, the chair's plastic-coated. - You're fucking crazy, you know that? You're a fucking nut, you fucking stupid fucking bitch! Just fucking let me out of here you stupid fucking cow! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you stupid fucking bitch! (muffled screaming) Let me out of here! Let me out... Of here. (coughing) (urine trickling) (peaceful piano music) - Is the camera running? Good. (dramatic music) - What's this, party time? - Every day's a party for me, Tevin. (lighter clicking) A few questions. - What's he doing? - A friend. A helping hand. - He makes your films, does he? - I can't do everything myself. I've only got one pair of hands. And why do you assume it's a man. - (scoffs) It's just an assumption. - Mmm. An accepted form of speech. Well, they don't help very much, do they, these accepted forms of doing things. They leave you very vulnerable to the unexpected, the chance encounter. Anyway, back to my questions. I wanted to ask you about your family. We already established that you lied to me about that, right? Isn't that right? - Yes. - Do you love your family. - Yes. - And that definitely includes your wife? - That definitely includes my wife. - Yet, you never mentioned your family when you tried to put your hand up my skirt. Or were you gonna wait until after you fucked me. To tell you the truth, I don't really give a damn. Were you intending to tell your wife that you'd fucked another woman stupid? (laughing) Of course you've done all this before. You've done all this before. - Yes, I've slept with other women. But I'm not different from millions of other men, for god's sake. It doesn't make me a criminal. I still love my wife and my kids. I still care for them! - And you used condoms with these other women? - Yes! No. Sometimes. - Sometimes? Sometimes. - Put that fucking knife down. You stupid fucking bitch. (screams) - You have no objection then, to the mixing of bodily fluids, even with a woman as positive as me. - Oh no. No. No! (sobbing) No! (sobbing) - (laughs) Did you get that? I don't think he wants to do another take. (sobbing) (eerie electronic music) The diazepam's still working. He'll be out for at least another few hours. (dramatic music) I've brought you some food. Suit yourself. - Is this your way of dealing with the fact that you have AIDS? - I never suggested any such thing. - You said you were positive. - Positivity can mean lots of things. It could mean I'm optimistic. I'm a very happy person, Tevin. I was only teasing you earlier. - So you haven't got AIDS? - Do you want this food or not? - I don't understand any of this. - You keep repeating this, why don't you just do me a favor and stop. Why don't you just have some of this lovely french onion soup that I made specially for you, since I know how much you love French things. - Fuck off with you! Fuck off! What is all this for? Why are you doing this to me? You don't even know me! I've got kids! Do you care about them? Why are you doing this? What the fuck is this bandage for? Why do you bother after what you've done to me? - I trained as a doctor. - Oh, fuck's sake. A doctor. Can I have a cigarette? - Do you smoke a lot? - Oh, fuck off. - Do you smoke a pack a day? I know what brand. I know where you work. You leave home at 8:15 and arrive at 9:00, when you're on time. You take lunch at 1:30. On Mondays you go bowling. - How long have you been following me? - On Tuesdays you play badminton. - Then you usually have sex with some slut in the car park afterwards. - You weren't stood up at that bar, were you? You planned everything! - No one knew you in that cocktail bar, did they? The waiter paid no attention to us. He was far too busy and your tip was far too small ever to be remembered. You always choose out of the way places for your pickups, don't you, where you're sure that no one will recognize you. But guess what? I'm sure that no one noticed me either. - You're fucking cracked, you are. Yeah, you're fucking cracked! - Well, let's change the subject, why don't we? Why don't you tell me about your work? Do you like your job? - Yes. - And how about your boss? Do you get on well? - Yes. We have a lot in common. We're good friends. But you wouldn't know that, friendship, would you? - [Anne-Marie] Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you have a lot more in common with your boss than you think. - Ah fuck. - Ever wondered how you got your job? You didn't have any qualifications, did you? You were pretty much a washout at school. Isn't that right? And yet, you got the job. He lives on your street, doesn't he, your boss? Friendly with your wife, too. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret, Tevin. Your boss has been screwing your wife for years. - You're a fucking liar! - I've seen them do it. They've done it all over your smelly little suburban house. (laughs) Kitchen floor seems to be their favorite. Not much room in there. - You're fucking sick, you are, you're sick! Shut up, will you? - Want a cigarette, Tevin? Hold the knife up to his throat. If he moves, slice him. (dramatic music) (soft sobbing) Take a nice, deep drag, Tevin. I can hear your blood starting to thicken already. Like boiling jam. (coughing) (laughing) (wheezing) (coughing) If all chain smokers reacted the way you did, the world would be a much healthier place. Maybe I could ever market it as a cure. What do you think? (coughing) (tense piano music) Look, I brought you something to read. Good, classic literature, things I'd like you to take an interest in. Are you listening to me? He's sulking again. You are such a pain. Here, look at this. The Sexual Conundrum by Professor Jacqueline Gebhardt. There are whole chapters about you in here. Looks like I wasn't the only one following you around. In fact, it looks like Professor Gebhardt's been camping out right under your own bed. Look at this! You can read, can't you? Oh, this must be what the sulk is all about. Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I can teach you. I'm a very patient teacher. - Of course I can fucking read. - Well, that's good to hear. Now. - Give me some water. - Can't you concentrate... - Give me some water, will you? - Oh, you are suck a fussy one. - Fuck off! (Spits) - Here. Now, here's a book by another professor. This one is on sexual deviation, which happens to be a pet project of mine. You do read books, don't you? - I read the newspapers. - Well when was the last time you read a book? - I don't remember. - Well, what was it? - If I could remember what book it was, I'd remember when it was, wouldn't I? - Well roughly when was it? - A few years ago. - A few years ago? There are so many books to read, and you read one every few years. Doesn't it bother you? - No, I don't give a fuck. - Well how do you ever learn anything? - I watch television, like you. - I do not watch television. I watch films, my own films. There's a very big difference. Television is just full of brainless garbage. - There are news programs. - Oh yes, there are news programs presented by the plastic couple with mid-atlantic hairdos and eyes frozen on the autocue, giving us prepackaged news items that have had all the dirt and bugs cleaned off them in case it puts someone off their dinner. - Confessions of a Strippergram. - What? - Confessions of a Strippergram, that's the last book I read. - Don't tell me, a book about sex? - Yes. - Well, why don't you tell me some of your fantasies, then. - I don't need to fantasize. I have no problems with women! - You don't need to have problems to have fantasies. Well let me put it another way then. What do you think about when you're masturbating? Or don't you do that either? - Normal things. - You're so proud of being normal. You make it sound like an achievement or something. You're going to have to be a lot more specific, or how are you gonna help me with my research? - Fuck your research! - Wrong answer, Tevin. Now, what do you think about when you're jerking off? - A pretty woman wearing sexy clothes, a firm body. - So normal, well go on, what kind of clothes. - A lacy bra, suspenders, frilly underwear. - Haven't you ever longed to shave that pretty woman's cunt? Let me read you something. This is from A History of Sexual Fantasies. I often fantasize about being arrested and put on trial for spying on a couple manually mating two donkeys. This is a serious offense, and I am found guilty and sentenced to be fucked by the donkey in front of the whole court. I must do everyone's bidding or be whipped. I'm carried off naked to a stable, where I'm made to kneel on all fours and open my legs wide. I'm strapped so I cannot move. A woman leads a donkey up behind me, then I feel someone spreading grease around my cunt and right up my hole. They must've played with the donkey's prick to make it hard... - (spits) That's not a fantasy! That's filth! Any woman who thinks like that isn't fit to walk the streets. - They're only words, thoughts. There's another one in there written by a woman who was obsessed with men's asses. Every time she sees a nice round one, she imagines what it would be like to shove a huge dildo into it. Everyone's fantasizing, Tevin, everyone but you. Millions of people. - This is your fantasy, isn't it? Having a man tied down, defenseless. What is it that you want from me? - I want you to tell me your fantasy. I want you do dig down deep. I mean, even normal men have fantasies. - I used to think of an American porn movie I saw when I was 15 years old. There were these two fat women being seen to by this black girl with a 10 inch prick. I imagined that's me, with my 10 inch prick, and these fat women sitting on me, I'm fucking one, fingering the other, and it's so fucking hot and I love it and they love it, and it's getting harder and harder, and I'm getting in their with my prick, and I'm going in and out, in and out, in and out, I'm sweating and they love it, and I love it 'cause I love it, and I can't breathe, but it doesn't matter 'cause I'm enjoying it, and they love it as well. And what's the words they use in those American porn movies. Oh yeah, come on, baby, give it to me. Come on, baby, harder. - Fuck me harder, baby. - That's enough. - [Tevin] Come on, baby... - I said that's enough! - Well you asked me, didn't you? - I think we get the picture on that one. What other fantasies do you use? That can't be the only one that gets you going. - I used to think about wildlife programs. - Wildlife programs? - Yeah. All those animals mating, you know. Lions, that sort of thing. They're very explicit, those sort of films. - You are so fucking British. - Only in this country can someone get off on wildlife programs. But umm, tell me, Tevin, why were you so disgusted by my donkey story. It sounds like you've been getting off on that one for years. - I knew this was a sex thing all along. And all you wanted was a good fucking screw. I've heard about foreplay, but this is fucking ridiculous. - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on. Just untie me, take me upstairs. Tie me up if that's what you want. Fuck me, then let me go. 'Cause this is fucking ridiculous! - I wanna know something Tevin. Was there any truth to any of your fantasies? - I don't fantasize when I'm fucking someone. I don't think about anything. Absolutely nothing. - You know Tevin, I've heard it said that a man's ass is sacred. What do you think? I thinK it's a lot of bullshit. - I wouldn't know. I'll take your word for it. You're the expert. - Oh, praise indeed from one so innocent. Have you never thought of trying it, the divine lodgement as it's been described. (buzzing) (metal clinking) (wood buzzing) See. These things have been around 10,000 years or so, give or take a millennium. Early ones were made of basalt, I believe, and later on brass. The metal gave the sensation of semen. - You so much as touch me with that thing, I swear to you I'll kick your teeth down your fucking throat! - Guess what? I think it's time to defile the sacred hole. - Fuck off then! - Why Tevin? (screaming) (dark, dramatic music) (man on video screaming) - Who the hell are you? Do you ever get bored of wearing that hood? What's she got planned for today? You in on her plans, too? Hey! Can you hear me? You can't be deaf because she's always giving you orders. Hey, look at me, read my lips. That's it, now read carefully. When I get out of here, I'm gonna do that bitch. I'm gonna make sure she suffers before she goes to jail, and when she does, she's going down for a very long time. If you help me, let me out of here, it'd be good for you. I won't say anything about you to the police, it'd just be her. I bet she forces you to do this stuff, doesn't she. The way she treats you, it's like you're a slave or something. She talks to you worse than a dog. Can't you see how sick she is? Look, whatever she's got on you to make you go along with her, it won't matter if you help me by letting me go. There's no need to be afraid of her. I'll help you by putting her away. I'll give you a place to stay. I'll give you some money. That's it, just undo the straps and let me go, I'll help you, I promise. (dramatic music) (peaceful music) Who the hell are you? Where is she? - She's gone. - Gone? Gone where? - Gone for good. I didn't like the way she was taking things. - What are you talking about? She's gone, let me go? - I wanted her to let you go, but she disagreed. She was very cruel. I think she should've let you go. - Well if she's gone now, you can let me go now, can't you? What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? - She was my friend. Or I thought she was. I gave her a place to stay. - [Tevin] This is your house? - Yes. - Oh Christ. - I used to listen to her problems, night after night. She was such a liar, such a fake. She never trained as a doctor. That was me, not her. She was a patient in a psychiatric unit. Locked her up for killing a horse. That's me all over, I'm soft-hearted. I guess I felt sorry for her. But then as the old story, you give 'em an inch, they take a mile. - [Tevin] You could've stopped her. - Oh, I have stopped her now. - [Tevin] Where is she? - You don't believe me. - [Tevin] I can't believe any of this. (dramatic music) - You see? - [Tevin] Christ. - I never liked the way she did her hair. Or her clothes. Drawing attention to herself like that. Not my way at all. - Oh God. - She was a dirty bitch. Upstairs, she used to tell me how she was attracted to you, how she wanted to special things to you, sexual things. It wasn't the point at all. She was disgusting. Well then. - I don't want to see it. Put it away. - You're right. Not a nice thing to look at. Anyway, I just thought I'd tell you things would be different from now on. I have to go clean up upstairs, but I'll be back soon. (dramatic music) You're beginning to look quite a mess, Tevin. You've got to keep up appearances. It's important to keep a presentable face. - It's just the same shit as before. You've just taken her place. What pleasure do you get from my suffering? Are you a sadist? Do you get off on those recordings? - Don't tell me you haven't seen any films which aren't just a little bit like mine. Violence, abuse, shootings, rape, but I suppose they're more stylishly done on TV, good guys and bad guys who deserve everything they got. Violence met with a necessary violent response, quick and sensational. Do these films seem fair to you? Portrayal of violence real? - For Christ's sake, everyone knows that that isn't real. They're only acting. - Let me put it another way. Did you ever witness a fight in a bar? Let's say someone smashed in the face with a glass or hit over the head with a bar stool? They fall over, and they don't get up, end of story. People in real life don't walk around with bullet holes in them, or with their skulls smashed open. They fall over, lie still. Covered in chalk. - But we know that's not real. - In real life, the blood starts to run, and people become senseless, frightened things. They run away, cower, hide. Violence is savage, destructive, and is feared. I have to admit, I enjoy violence and the consequences. Now isn't that something. I don't enjoy pain, myself. When it comes to pain, I'm as frightened as you are. Pain is a terrifying reality. - Then how can you do what you've done to me. - I'm the perpetrator. I only give pain. I don't receive it. I'm in control, that's how it is. Understand that women, too, can be violent. Or did you think it was just a male prerogative? How could you think you were always in control? The women are just there to be used. Not respected or feared. They're just as capable of manipulation and retaliation. - You need help, do you know that? Everything you see is twisted. Violence isn't everything around us. - You're wrong. Very wrong. The reality is, the violence never stops. The aftereffects remain forever, as in the bar scenario. People are traumatized, memory remains, even after the victim's been removed. Things just aren't the same. Atmosphere is different. Witnesses are scared, they try and stay calm by distancing themselves, by observing but never conceiving participation. As long as it happens to others, it's entertaining. They revel, safe in their positions as observers. Violence surrounds our lives, so we can never guarantee ourselves safety from it. You see, Tevin, very few of us admit to being violent, and when we do, we blame it on others. We say, oh, they provoked me. They had it coming. He deserved it. Any sane person would've done the same thing. But how many times have you heard those words? (dramatic music) - You are sane. You calculated all of this. What's your excuse? - I don't need an excuse. Appreciate the consequences of your actions. I started a chain reaction, a new consequence, and found you here. - What's your excuse? - I'm one of the very few brave souls who's recognized the true face of society and began to deal with it. It's dirty work, but somebody's got to do it. - Give me an answer, what's your excuse? - I'm giving you all something to think about. - You can't give me one good reason, can you? You can't excuse yourself. - I'm the other half of the sky. The alternative. There have to be people like me, don't you see that? - What are you trying to tell me? That people like you are normal? That this kind of cruelty is normal? - I'm definitely in the minority, but I'm not unique. There are many countries where I would be highly valued by the state. - The Third Reich ended, or hadn't you heard? - Oh, there are plenty around still. Just take a visit to some South American countries. More interestingly, look to see who's supporting them. - There's only good and evil, right and wrong. And you are both wrong and evil. - Of course I wouldn't expect someone of your background to say anything else. But I'm hoping to convince you otherwise. To open you up to other possibilities. You don't even have to tell me when you finally understand. You can just keep it up here if you like. - (sighs) I know enough to know that you're a freak. And that with people like you they lock them up and throw away the key, that's all. - But I'm not locked up, I'm still here and I've plenty to do. Now, I want you to get a bit of rest. You've got a lot to do as well over the next few days. Take the chance to dream. Your subjective imagination, I find, is often very honest. - I believe in the power of good. I believe in the power of God. I believe in the power of God. (dark, dramatic music) (demonic voice speaking foreign language) (woman moaning) (dark, dramatic music) (phone ringing) - [Tevin's Wife] Hello? Hello? Who's there? Tevin? (woman laughing maniacally) - I've got a surprise for you, look. - My kids. Where did you get them? - Oh, took them myself, not bad, eh? Light was a little poor, though. - When did you see them? - Oh, just yesterday. - Oh Jesus, you haven't touched them. You haven't touched them! - No, had a word though. A brief chat. I think they quite liked me. Maybe they could smell you on my clothes. - [Tevin] God. - Would any man betray his own children? Would you give your life to protect them? If I told you I had your kids upstairs, would that help you to start telling the truth, to realize your complacency, admit your bad attitude? - You frustrated, bitter, and twisted PMT bitch! (dramatic music) - I have a film too, would you like to see it? I haven't done anything, just a bit of candid camera. - I don't want to see it. Turn it off! I can't stand this, turn it off. - They don't seem to be missing you too much, do they? Your wife looks a little sulky, but that's not unusual for a woman in a shopping mall. - Maybe you've got your own twisted reasons for keeping me here, but don't touch them. They've done nothing. - They've got your blood inside them. - Don't touch them, please. - I'm not making any promises. - I wouldn't trust anyone who bleeds for a week and doesn't die. - I'm thinking of doing a little porn movie starring your wife and your boss. They're still seeing each other, you know, despite your disappearance. Now they've got an excuse. They can console in bed. - It isn't true, it isn't true. - Life goes on. (water trickling) - Get off me! - I can do what I fucking like. I'm a woman, and I'm angry, and you, for the first time in your life, will have to make an effort to understand why. - You're a fucking Nazi, the way you behave. - Don't lecture me you little shit! I'm a spiritual woman. And don't compare me to the scumbags of history. The Nazis were a bunch of morons. - They were evil like you. They tortured the Jews for pleasure. They tried to exterminate a whole race. - Race? Race? What has race got to do with anything? If you're going to torture someone, you might as well be objective about it. The SS guards in the camps were systematically desensitized. Violence isn't unusual. The capability is in all of us. When it becomes normal, then everyone is capable of it. As long as they remained safe. Those guards were disgusted at first, but they were encouraged to drink, to be drunk on duty. They were shown by others how to carry out their tasks. After a while it was just another job, like baking bread, and then they showed others... - What are you trying to tell me? That torture and murder is normal behavior? You're worse than a fucking Nazi! - That I take as a compliment. I don't care if you're a Jew or a communist or a terrorist, what the fuck has that to do with anything? - At least it made sense. At least they had a purpose. There's no meaning to what you do except for your own sadistic pleasure. - If you're going to make a revolution, make it for fun. Don't make it in ghastly seriousness. Do it for fun. Don't do it because you hate people. Do it just to spit in their eye. - I could almost pity you. You're so sick. - Oh, I do try, but sometimes it's not possible. With a biological mistake like you on my hands it's very hard to see the funny side of things. It's such hard work. Training monkeys would be simpler. (grunting) You stupid bastard! (static crackling) Working. Recording properly. Need it for my work. - That's a real shame. You'll just have to get yourself a new one, a tougher one. (dramatic music) - [Julia] Guarantee's run out, Tevin! (static crackling) (peaceful acoustic music) - Oh Jesus, what is it now? - Ever heard of domestic violence, Tevin? We're gonna play a game of sorts. Bit of machinery for this one, too. If you win, I might even let you go. - Why should I believe anything you say? - You don't have a choice. No stranger to knives are you, Tevin? - Knives? - Yes, knives, like this one. - It's for protection, that's all. - [Julia] Self-protection? - It's dangerous on the streets these days. - That's quite so. Now, have you ever used this knife on another person? - No. - Is that no you haven't used the knife, no not recently or no don't cook me? - No, I haven't. (microwave beeps) (dramatic music) - You're lying. You'll feel a faint itching at first which will soon become uncomfortable. This will rapidly be superseded by a feeling of pins and needles. Then the pins and needles will become heated. - [Tevin] Turn it off. - Now the pins and needles are burning molten. Oh, the molecules are really dancing. (groaning) Now now, calm down. It'll be over soon and you know how to stop it happening again. - Alright, alright, I'll tell you! I stabbed somebody! - You stabbed somebody. An evil assailant intent on evil doing as you wended your way back to the bosom of your family, eh? - I don't know what the fuck you're on about. (microwave beeping) In this car park this bloke just started on me for no reason, he was a nutter! - I said I wanted you to tell me the truth about yourself. You're going to unburden yourself. You're not doing it. (groaning) I used to go to the courts to watch pigs like you on trial. But I'm not a vigilante. I'm just a casual observer. I was at your trial. You were lucky to get a suspended sentence for malicious wounding. - Alright, alright, I'll tell you! (heavy breathing) This bloke, he was looking at me. Staring. I didn't like it. I'd had a few drinks. You know what it's like. - I don't know what it's like or I wouldn't ask. - He just got to me, staring at me, I didn't like it. No way can a man look at another man like that and get away with it. - Maybe he fancied you. - I had to deal with it. That's just the way it is. - So you stabbed him? - Yes, I cut him. I sliced the black bastard. - Accurately, you severed the supinator longus just below the elbow. If he hadn't put his arm up, you'd have slashed his throat, wouldn't you? - I don't know. Like I said I'd been drinking. Anyway, he's up for it. He wanted to have a go. - You were with a woman that night, weren't you? Sitting drinking with a tarty young friend. Fog outside, cozy and warm inside. Scotch fingers on her thighs. - She was a friend. I never laid a finger on her. - You forget I was in the courtroom. I saw her. She looked like a hooker. No man could be friends with a woman like that. You never laid a finger on her because you were arrested before you had a chance. Displaying your antlers for the servile doe. Drawing blood from a rival is a sure way to make her lay down and offer her hindquarters. - You're fucking weird, you know that? I'll tear your fucking eyes out! - You're in no position. No position at all to be shouting orders at me. Don't you know what I could do to you lying there in a pile of your own shit! - Well do it then, go on! Speechless, eh? Lost for words. That makes a fucking change! - I don't have to say anything. I could just sit here and watch you for hours or days. Watch you rot away in that chair. Is that passive enough for you? How would that suit you? We could sit here and listen to some music. Watch with mother. Mother and her baby-husband lying in his shitty nappy. Is that passive enough for you? - No! - You've already been judged, convicted, and sentenced to hell. Nothing else matters now. Know and expect only pain, pain upon pain. Ever increasing pain. (screaming) (dramatic music) ♪ You abandoned me ♪ ♪ You abandoned me ♪ - Did you sleep well? Oh I'm sorry. I forgot to get you a pillow. - (scoffs) Sometimes, I don't know what you're about. - Today's a special day. - Why special? It's just you me and these four black walls as usual. - Oh, but that's where you're wrong. I feel I ought to confess something to you. You see, we're not down here alone at all. - Oh Jesus, don't tell me you've got another little helper. - You've probably guessed by now that you're not the first visitor to my basement. - It's visiting day, is it? Yeah, I've seen your other visitors. - Oh, but you haven't. Met them face to face, I mean. Call me old fashioned, but I think that people should be properly introduced. (dramatic music) They're not visitors. They never left. - Oh my God. - I know everyone assembled here by name. Some of them are very old friends. I can still picture their faces. To me it's like a photograph album. Each one a good memory. Some of them people are mixed up in the same jar. That seemed funny to me. I knew they wouldn't have got on when they were alive. But I'm sure they've reconciled their differences by now. People do, you know, if you give them enough time and space. - [Tevin] How many people? - Now there's a question. You know, I can't remember exactly. Lost their tongues I suppose. They learned to listen. We talked at length. And eventually, they came around to my perspective. I'm going to do a portrait of you, Tevin. Who knows, it might be worth a fortune one day. You know how trendy the art market can be. (dramatic music) (dark, eerie music) That's healing up nicely. I'm glad it didn't become infected. - What the fuck is that? - Nature's little helpers. We're going to play another little game. I'm going to place certain morsels in your mouth, and you have to guess what they are. A correct answer wins you a point, a wrong one, and you meet a helper. - If I like the taste of them would you mind if I ate them? 'Cause I'm getting pretty hungry. - Oh, that's fine by me. Bon appetit. Open wide, Tevin. Well? - Slug. - Very good. And this. (spitting) - Disgusting, dog shit - Oh, very good, but no you're wrong. It's some of your shit. Scooped it out whilst you were asleep. And this? - Urine. - How did you know that? - Tasted it when I was a kid, a taste not easily forgotten. - Maggots, you sick bitch! - You know, when I was in medical school we once had this patient that came in with the most enormous swollen testicles. The slightest touch was incredibly painful to him. Eventually, we had to knock him out. X rays didn't show much, so we took him to theater. Do you know what we found? His testicles were infested by a colony of maggots. The patient later admitted that he got off on feeding live maggots up his urethra. - That's a good story. With an imagination like that, you should be writing horror books. - Oh, I can assure you it's the truth Tevin. I only told you so you'd know how tenacious they are. - [Tevin] No! (Groans) (Julia shrieks) (groans) (intense music) (grunting) (intense music) (grunting) (screaming) (electricity crackling) (tense, haunting music) (man laughing maniacally) - Just a couple of little injections to prepare you for your operation. You ever try drugs when you were a teenager, Tevin? - What is that? - I guess not. You're far too straight laced, aren't you. LSD is very good for the creative mind. I'd like to see what it can do for you. It'll only take a couple of minutes. Enjoy the ride. Power is gained from torture, the longer the torture, the greater the power. The smell of your death is near. It's the smell of freedom. You're afraid of me because I'm different. If you get to know me, understand me, you will no longer fear me. (chaotic music) Stop hating and start thinking. Someday the world will these tapes of your visit. The views will watch the prelude to violence, the violence, and the most important part, the aftereffects and the consequences of that violence, and they will understand me. - [Tevin Recording] Where do you come from? - [Julia] I only speak in English so you can understand me. You don't speak my language. (screaming) (wood creaking) (chaotic static) (chaotic music) (screaming) - How are you feeling now? Painkillers working, yes? Feeling a bit off, oh yes? I bet you're beginning to think I'm totally psychotic. Do you think I am insane? Simple yes or no will do. - Off, turn it off. - It's very simple, really. This is order, and this is chaos, and this is insanity, and this is the borderline. It's flexible, like a rubber brand. I practice running headlong at the rubber band and let it pull me into chaos and let it pull me back into order. Now I have you. We can run at it together. I'll take you across. We can experience it together. - Off, turn it off. - Your own foolish actions brought you here. Condemned you! But then again you were condemned at birth, born to serve the nation. - [Tevin] It's a worm. - I bet you always paid your taxes on time. Bet you always thought you were free, that you made up your own mind, made your own decisions. - [Tevin] Turning into worms. - Now I know you have a heart. You hid it so well. It took me such a long time to reach it. You should count yourself lucky. I've just condensed what could have been a long and weary and pointless life. - God help me, somebody. - Getting it all over and done with. - Oh, God help me, somebody, please. - Has God ever come to your aid? Ever met anybody he has helped, lent a few bucks to when they were starving? You're here all alone. You'll have to rely on yourself for preservation. - Oh God. - God's dead. She died brokenhearted by her critics. She died from lack of respect. - [Tevin] Being eaten alive. - Oh, here are some souvenirs for you. The American bitch's eyes. She can watch your bowel movements for a while. (dramatic music) Hmm? Oh, and And I'll put this in too, so you don't lose it. (slow, melancholy music) (Tevin groaning) - It's raining outside, quite heavily. I've just been for this long walk in the park. Laid myself down on the grass. There was just this old man and his dog, no one else. He was watching me, must have thought I was crazy. Lay there looking up at the sky, the rain lashing down on my face, smack in the eyeballs. It's a wonderful feeling. It puts everything in perspective. Have you ever done that? - I'd like to. I'd like to see the sky again. - You will see the sky again. Maybe not with those eyes, but you will see. - Couldn't you just let me out of here for a while. I won't try and escape, I promise. I only want to see outside. - [Julia] You seem very weak. - Please. - [Julia] That would just hurt you more. To let you get a glimpse and bring you back down here. - Oh please. - I couldn't do that. - Please, I promise. I beg you. - We're growing closer, Tevin. Trust and affection between us. - Just a look. That's all I ask. - You don't need to be afraid of the dark, or this room. There's nothing more to worry about. Everything's taken care of. Everything's practically over. - Just a look. I know it's over, I can feel it. But I'm scared. - You mustn't be scared. Death is the greatest adventure of all. I've seen their faces as they go. The look of bliss. I'll envy you that. - Just one look. - Go on then. (peaceful music) (Tevin groaning) I'll wait for you here. Don't be too long, Tevin. (groaning) (peaceful music) Nevermind. Nevermind. (dramatic music) - Is it over? - When I was a little girl, I used to have an altar in my bedroom, with candles and everything. I thought of it as my personal line to God. I was happy. Whenever anything frightened me I used to run to my altar and speak to him. My parents used go out and leave me. I don't know where they went. But they were always dressed up and smelt of cigarettes and perfumes. Meant grown up places where they speak a different language. One night a candle fell over. I was asleep. The room caught fire It spread so quickly. I ran to a neighbor, but the whole house went up. And the faith went with it. As I stood watching the flames I screamed at God. It was his altar, but there was nothing. Nothing. Sadness never leaves you, Tevin. The melancholy lasts forever. To be on the outside looking down on the world. I don't suppose you could ever have imagined what that was like. Whatever I did to you wouldn't have made any difference. You'd never have joined me. Maybe through the haze of pain you caught a glimpse. That's all I could hope for. That's all I've ever got from the others, and you're not exceptional Tevin. You're just the average victim. - I'm sorry. I want to live. I want to live. I want to see my wife and my kids. - Like a rat that's fallen in a barrel of water. Hopelessly looking for a way out, right up until the last moment. Do you love me for what I'm doing to you? - I love you. (clears throat weakly) I love you. - My name is Julia. - I love you, Julia. - I love you, too, Tevin. But you can't stay here any longer. I'm finished with you. My job's done. There's nothing more I can teach you. You're no longer able to learn, and soon, you will owe me. One last thought, Tevin, to whom will society give the glory? Who will be remembered in history? The mass killer or the names of the faceless victim. The killer is immortalized. The victim becomes either a number or one nameless note, part of a number. Tevin, you've become less than a number. You were born the victim you became. Claim your inheritance with pride. (choking) (dramatic music) (slow, dark music) - [Woman] What happened? - Welcome to the world of the living. How are you feeling? - Where am I? Did you tie me up? - It's a fun thing. We're going to have some fun. - I don't understand. Please let me out of this chair. Your accent's changed. You're not American. - No, I'm not American. Sometimes I like to pretend to be somebody I'm not. It's so boring always being the same person all the time, don't you think? - [Woman] You weren't like this before. I want to go home now. - [Julia] You invited yourself here. You wanted to see my film. - [Woman] I've changed my mind. I want to go now. - And I want you to see my film. You missed all the best bits when you passed out. We can see it now. - Please let me go. I want to go now! - You'll feel better soon, and then we can have some real fun. Come watch. - I want to go now! - And I want you to stay! (woman screaming) That's better. Now, come watch the video. - And then can I go. (woman on video screaming) (dramatic music) (woman on video screaming) - I hope you rot with cancer you bitch! - Oh come on, let's have a bit more action You just like dead meat - Screw you! - I'm enjoying myself. - I'll never give in to you, do you hear me? (speaking drowned out by screaming) - [Julia] Imagine your girl's fate? How would you like that? - [Man In Chair] I won't listen to your filth! (speaking drowned out by music) (woman screaming) (peaceful music) (dramatic music)
