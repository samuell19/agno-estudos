Nobody has ever seen a bald-headed Indian... I think often that the most interesting view out a train is the back window. You go to the very back car 'cause you can see a full 180 view out the back. It's something kind of poetic as you leave. You can't really see out the front of the train. That's not really possible, 'cause it's the engines and conductors and all that. But the back is yours, and that's interesting, 'cause it's what's behind you now. All of life is just memory. The present, if you have a timeline, and you look at the present, it's a point. And everything on this side of it is the future, and that side's the past. And a point does not have dimension. So, the present doesn't have any time. I was thinking about why I make films, and I thought, "well, it" started when I was very young." Mommy, mommy, mommy! I grew up in Milwaukee in the '50s, and it was a time when parents didn't worry about their kids being outside, and you could just go, and as long as you didn't get into trouble, you could keep going. And it was always about adventure and about having an experience that would kind of make my neighborhood get bigger. And I didn't think of that as a kid, but now I think it's what I've been doing my whole life. I have a lot of sympathy for people in their 20s, who are sort of wanting to do something different or discover what they're most passionate about or live a life of purpose. Cinema was the thing that saved me. I just would spend all my time reading about film or watching movies. It was probably that necessary period where you have to sort of separate yourself from everything you knew before, or as you sort of define yourself as an adult. I often joke, when people ask if I went to film school... I says, "oh, I went to the" Stanley Kubrick film school," which means you just buy a camera, and you learn how to use it, and you start making movies. The uncertainties of the '60s... Find that one line. You remember that line perfectly. Okay. You reread it ten times 'cause it was just like it nailed it. It's hard to say what's going on. Okay. And watch his hair. It's always this side. Whatever's in the camera, sometimes, it... you feel it falling in your face, just very subtly kind of... I'll try. No. No! Of course not. Us? Okay. How could you even suggest that? Let's go! Hey, morning. Morning, man. How goes it? Good, good. Let me dump this off. It's over here, huh? Yeah, around the corner. I love the Polish poster. You can't really tell. Like, "what movie's that?" What would be that? I really want to go see. Takes a while. You put all the names together. Ah! It's a wonderful opportunity, and we're so pleased if you'd come and join us for the weekend and see films and do some films. So, it's my great pleasure to introduce Richard Linklater, the artistic director of the Austin film society, who will be introducing... Well, thanks, guys, for coming out. I just want to encourage you to see all the films this weekend. It's just a great opportunity to see some work of one of the world's great visual artists. You know, 25 years ago, in 1988, the film society had our first. Grant money ever from the city and the state, and it had always been an ambition to be able to bring in filmmakers. So, the very first filmmaker I wanted to bring in, whose work intrigued me the most, was James Benning. I'm always amazed at your movies. I love just the experience of watching them. You realize we're all watching the exact same images, but I'm sure we're all having very different experiences in our that's so rare in the modern world, where you really get 10 minutes to just study nature. And I think that's more of a challenge all the time, 'cause if you really think about it, how many of us have sat for 10 minutes and just studied the way light moves, the ripple of a wave, all the things in the natural world? Your films remind me how beautiful... So, I mean, I'm happy to present this film, because it confronts you with a reality that's actually always there, but we're getting further and further away from. After I made these films in the '90s that were dealing with text and image and with lots of information, I became very interested in early, very early cinema, before narrative was introduced in these kind of observational films that I thought were really amazing, and I thought this is where, really, film had a great strength and that by the introduction of narrative and especially narrative language, it took us away from what I was seeing as a really strong point for film. In the last 10 or 12 years, I've been investigating that, kind of going back to the beginning of cinema. I knew the first shot was gonna be the sunrise, and I knew the last shot was gonna be these relentless waves coming into somewhat suggest infinity, that these lakes... we're killing these lakes, but in the end, they're gonna outlast us, because we'll be shook off the earth like fleas. And the lakes will then clean themselves up. In a sense, that's the feeling I got from visiting all these places. That's the kind of larger thing I think I learned from this film. So, the offices for the film society are back in there now, huh? Yeah, yeah, we've kind of... This is my triple-wide, which is technically owned by the kind of... I'm working off the rent. I bought it, but everything out here's owned by the city, so I kind of rent it from the studio. And this is your production offices, and then... This is the stage. That used to be an airplane that was an old office. So, we were able to get all these buildings and use them for the industry, 'cause, you know, back then, if you were shooting a bigger production, you'd park your truck somewhere. The art department would be in south Austin. It was all dispersed. So, now you can just shoot a bigger film. You can have your construction crew in the hangar over there, your office there, build some sets there. This would have been the airport that I came in on 25 years ago to meet you for the first time. Back then, I was at the gate. You could go to the gate, and you'd come off the plane. You had the film in one hand, 16-millimeter box, with a handle, and, like, a grocery bag, not even full, like, wound down. A toothbrush and a pair of underwear. You were that. I said, "do you have any other" like, "no." And you were here for a few yeah, yeah. I was really impressed. I was like, "okay, I really like" this guy." I still travel... I know! I think that's what you had... And I think you were wearing that same thing, too. Probably. Often, I will edit on note cards. I'll make 10 note cards for each, and then I will put some vector on it to show me which way the clouds might be moving. And I might put another symbol on it, to how quick it's moving or how colorful it is. So, I can look at these 10 cards with maybe 5 different symbols on them. And it's like taking 10 cards that are clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds and arranging them so they're not all together. Does that make sense? I make symbols that represent movement, color, direction, sound, value, and then I put them in order so that they all the clubs aren't together, all the diamonds aren't together. And then I do a cut that way, in this case on a flatbed, and then I look it and say, "oh, that's" pretty good, but that one isn't "in the right place," and I might move it somewhere else. It seems like a simple job to order 13 shots or 10 shots, but 13 factorial is somewhere in the millions. So, I'm sure I don't have the best order, 'cause there's so many possibilities. We were... I was finishing editing "slacker." You were in town. It was that time we were "sweet smell of success" or one of the movies. We were in the room, and we were into the last, you know, probably the last ten minutes of the movie. And you made a joke, like, someone enters the room, and you just said kind of casually, "and then we just go off with "those two people," and the movie goes right at the climax of the movie, and I kind of got I was like, "oh, man." I just did a whole movie about like, we just go off with those I just thought that was pretty kind of for a second, I was sort of stunned. I was like, "oh, no." Is that a bad idea?" Actually surprised I've never yeah, as much as you've been in Austin, the infamous Mount Bonnell. And you filmed "slacker"... The end of it was done in, what would that have been... '89, summer of '89. We were shooting. I remember being at outdoor parties and tying a camera to the end of a fishing pole, and, like, casting it out. And it'd get stuck in a tree. And the camera would be so, I had all this old footage, and I actually used some of that, 'cause we had the footage. When we threw the cameras off mount Bonnell, we went down and we processed that footage, but it was kind of blurry, you know. We probably had four cameras going and then had that super-8 and I had met this girl that summer who actually had a JK optical printer. Uh-huh. So, it took it from super-8, the reversal... And then you blew it up. Yeah, blew it up to 16 negative. And then kind of on a Bolex. That was really wonderful. And then ended up blowing that up to 35, eventually. So, that film had covered a lot of formats. We even had Pixelvision. We had video. Hey, Kelly, nice shoes. Hey, what is that? Oh, it's my Pixelvision it's for a project that I'm putting together. Hey, um, I'll tell you what. Why don't want one of you take it and shoot whatever you want? Pass it around, and we'll see what we come up with later on, okay? But I want my camera back, all right? I had many students over the last 25 years that were actually inspired to become filmmakers from seeing a film that talked to them directly. It was like... It feels like a film they could make, in a way. That's what inspired me. You see a film, and you go, "ahh." I talk with my students today about I'm not interested in them making another good film because there's a lot of good films, but I'm interested in students finding a new language, a new way of working, pushing to make the film culture grow, in a sense. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you set out to do that, but I think "slacker" was a beginning to open up a new language, a new... Yeah, I think in the narrative realm. I was very conscious of a new way to tell a story or to push the storytelling boundaries, 'cause, like you, I've always felt kind of oppressed by the three-acts story structure of the narrative history of cinema. A well-told story has its place, but, you know, I'm always trying to yeah, push that a little bit. Over lunch we can argue about yeah, yeah. Good. Come on. Backhand. Get in shape. Topspin. Oh, that's off. Oh. Way off. Yeah, anyone can shoot when... Okay, let's do it. Could do a 3-pointer. You got to really get warm to get the... I slowly... you have to kind of warm up and get to them. I'm working my way back. I have to work way, way back... 30 years or so. Yeah, yeah. Back to when they didn't even have a 3-pointer. You were at u.T. And played, too, right? No, I played at Sam Houston. Okay. Yeah, I went to school on a scholarship. At that point, that was such a focus of my life, you know? Yeah. I was just gonna go play college ball wherever I felt I could play soon est. I thought I'd play as a freshman somewhere. Well, I always brag I had a college scholarship, too, but tuition was only $90. Yeah. I think it was pretty cheap when I was there, too. I think now it actually means something. But I quit after two years, and I think you quit because you had some heart problems at one yeah, it's like it quit me. Yeah, I played... I really only played one year. It was on the Eve of my sophomore year. I remember I was playing left field, batting third in the lineup, playing as good as I ever played. And then... Just had this heart-rhythm thing. Couldn't run. It was almost like a career-ending injury, you know? When did you admit to yourself you weren't gonna make the big leagues? I think it was about when I was I don't think I still have. I still kind of think... [laughing 1 you still have a I had a dream, like, about... It was a few years ago. It was almost like a bad movie. You get one at bat in the major leagues or something. I don't know. Yeah, delusion... I don't know. I think it's important in sports and in arts, in a way. You have to think you're... no matter how good you are, you have to think you're a little better than you are. And how many films have you made that deal with baseball? I know you made a film with coach or about the coach. I did a documentary. In "dazed and confused," my young character... there's a brief baseball scene, where he's pitching, like, little league. Strike three! And I find now, like, directing a movie with a big crew and a lot of cast and a lot of people, I'm a lot like my coaches. Like a good coach, treats every player a little... kind of gives them what they need. Different players need different levels of coddling, instruction, reassurance, tough love. A good coach intuits that. That way, if it hops either way... See? Use your legs. All right? Run this way. Catch the ball like that. Oh! Ahmad Abdul Rahim. Here. Yo, bro, what up? Nothing much. Just ready to play some baseball. 25, huh? Ken Griffey, right? No. Satchel Paige? No. No. Willie Mays? No. It's mark McGwire. Mark McGwire? But he's a white. Yes, he's from Claremont. He's my favorite player. Huh. Well, the Indianapolis clowns was in the negro American league, and it was back in the days, just in case people don't remember, it was back in the days what negro ballplayers, black ballplayers, called the major leagues. We considered it major leagues. In fact, I've always said that if you could play with the Indianapolis clowns or any of those teams in the negro American league that you were essentially playing in the big leagues. We played as many as three games I remember playing a doubleheader in Washington, then playing a night game in Baltimore. So, that's three games. And we would travel. We would stay in a hotel only once a week, and that would be on a Saturday. The rest of the time we'd be traveling on a bus. We would get $2-a-day meal money. And some days, I can remember getting a dollar worth of baloney sausage and... Come on! Throw it by him! Throw it by him! He can't hit. Coming to you, James. I wanted to make that Willie Mays grab. What a snag, man. He did it. Oh! We approach films in much different ways, yet we have a lot of things in common. I never really liked films. I was never a big fan of films. I was never a cinephile. And I know you became a filmmaker by really becoming interested in films like the French new wave, who looked at many films and was very inspired by filmmaking before them. And I think you still carry a lot of that with you but maybe not with the same zest as to begin with. I'm curious about that, anyway. Well, you kind of came at it from... you're sort of in, like, just visual art in general, yeah, I think so. I mean, I made films because I saw a Maya Deren film on TV, and then, eight years later, I bought a camera. So, you can see that I had an engagement, but it didn't really move me much. It took me eight years, but it must have been pretty strong if I was still thinking about it eight years later. But in that 8-year interim, were you studying, like, when you would go to a gallery or see painting, did you think something was forming in your head about the real-time nature of film and how you might use it someday? I came to all this very late I didn't buy a camera until I was in my mid-20s or more, and I really didn't feel... Mid-20s late in life? Well, for kids today, of course. Oh, well, yeah, they start at but I really didn't know what art was. I thought art was paint and making a nice sailboat with a watercolor. And I still admire that. But I didn't know that there is an art practice out there that has a philosophy in it. It has dialogue that's continually going on, and one can engage in that. I didn't figure that out until I was in graduate school, in film, and I was 30 years old. I think you're blessed by that, though. In a way, because I was very involved politically, doing political organizing and things like that that kept me from looking at things that you saw and brought you into filmmaking. But I was a little bit later, too, certainly by modern standards. When you grow up in Huntsville, Texas, it doesn't cross your mind, "oh, I can make a film." I thought at best I wanted to be a novelist. And then, somewhere in college, that shifted to potentially playwright. I remember I was playing college baseball, and then, you know, that was over, and I was working offshore. And I think there was a certain void in my life, and I just found myself wandering into movie theaters, going to four films a day. I just got really fascinated in the history of film, the storytelling. I was just kind of falling in love with cinema, you know? Then, I realized you could rent a movie for 100 bucks or something, and it was like, "oh", well, let's get people to help "us pay for this." And my roommates at the time, Lee Daniel, Brecht Andersch, and other people around town who were kind of the film freaks. We just started showing films at various venues. And then, I think that was... Again, it was kind of coming out of a void. Cassavetes talks about film as a parallel universe for people who don't like the real world. Mm-hmm. Who don't know how to dress or be normal or be official. And I think I agree. The film world was just this other world that encompassed the world, but I preferred it. A couple friends of mine and I, we started a film society we still run here in Austin. The Austin film society. Yeah, that's been going nine there's a lot of independent filmmakers in town. Yeah, we just had a screening today, in fact, I just came I'm as proud of the film society as anything. Doing "Oshima" and Godard retrospectives and stuff like my whole life was just cinema. Well, Rick, you seem to have survived your Hollywood experience. "Dazed and confused" did well, got good reviews. Circulated around, became a cult film. And evidently you're able to make another film, "before sunrise." What's the concept of it? It has elements that "slacker" and "dazed" don't I think it's a little bit more of a story, and it's a male/female story, too. So, it's kind of a romance, my own version of a romance, I guess. I think people who make movies daydream about movies. That's the way I think, you know? I think of things in storytelling fashion. That's why I like acting, too. Fill the void, or I think it attracts a certain kind of personality that doesn't want a life in the real world and that movies kind of become your life and become your history and become your thoughts and the way you see the world. I didn't think I wanted to be a real member of the world. Movies were a universe that I could count on. Wouldn't let me down. I could go back and see "touch of evil" or "the crowd," "docks of New York," "citizen Kane" or something. Your latest film, we were talking about at dinner last night with the crew. They were arguing if there were 12 shots in it or 10 shots. But nevertheless, it was about how few shots are in this narrative film, which immediately my ears lit up because I thought, "oh, good", we're stripping ourselves of this kind of manipulative narrative language and letting "duration play out meaning." It has maybe 12 scenes or less, but within a few of those, there are... but there are some that are just really, really long shots. But I would go one more step. I don't think it's not manipulative. I think it's a... It's a huge construct. There's a crew. So, everything's manipulation. Yeah, I think it's all a manipulation. I think it might respect their intelligence, perhaps, a little more than a cross-cutting action thing, but, at the same time, I just think it's all a construct. So, it's just disguised better, perhaps, but I don't have any delusions that it's real. Uh-huh. Too much effort goes into it. But you are very aware that the language that you're using is... Definitely not Hollywood traditional. Yeah. And yet it's not so obscure that... with the nontraditional formal qualities, I do have, parallel to that, traditional story qualities, even though they're not wildly entertaining. But what a couple goes through in a particular day or particular life, you know? I would say all your films have this double thing of nontraditional story... formal qualities, obviously, and then, also, nontraditional stories. Like, what you're trying to communicate doesn't fit into a narrative format. Well, I know as I get older, I have kind of... my life is pretty much being consumed now by my work itself. I've also decided that I don't want to be around people most of the time. So, I have a place in the mountains, and I hide. I think because of the way I feel really good by myself, I'm making films now that are very observational. In 2001, I bought some property in the Sierra Nevada mountains that had a nice house on it. And I started to remodel the house. And then, when I was finished, I thought, "well, now I'm done." "What do I do up here?" Because I like to work. And so I started to do paintings just to kind of calm down and copy paintings of outsider artists. And after about six months of doing that, I decided I wanted to do some construction again, and I began to build a copy of. Thoreau's cabin. It wasn't an exact replica of his cabin because nobody really knows what his cabin looked like. It's fairly well-described in "Walden." Then, I kept on painting, and, all the sudden, it occurred to me that I was maybe making an art project here. But it didn't have any edge to and I thought back to my film in the mid-'80s that I made, "American dreams," which used baseball cards and Henry Aaron. And it used speeches from 1954 to 1976 and also popular songs from those years. And at that point, I introduced the diary of Arthur Bremer, who was the person from Milwaukee, where I grew up, that went on to shoot George Wallace. And so, I thought, "well, that's" the same thing that my cabin's project needs. It needs another cabin that will "be a counterpoint." So, I decided to construct the cabin of Ted Kaczynski, the "unabomber," the one that was built in Montana, as a companion to the Thoreau cabin. Here, I'm going to confess to, or to be more accurate, brag about, some of the misdeeds I've committed in the last few years. There was a small, functioning mine... I'll call it mine "x" for future reference... a few miles from my cabin, on the south side of the Ridge that runs east from here. They had a large diesel engine mounted on the back of an old truck, apparently for running a large drill for boring holes in rock. I put a small quantity of sugar in the fuel tank of the diesel engine and also in the gas tank of the truck. Sugar in the gas is supposed to severely damage the cylinders and act as an abrasive. So, I think we also want to try to push cinema in different ways, and you're doing a very radical project now of making a film over a ten-year period, which I think is absolutely extraordinary, which I want to see parts of and perhaps tomorrow I'm gonna get to see some of that. But that's an amazing... again, and here, now, it's a narrative that happens across ten years, but it also is about how people actually age in that time span. So, it's real aging. Yes, not cinema. You change in ten years, in respect to that. So, all of that is in the film, if you like it or not. It's about how you change, how they change, and I really think it's... Or as Ethan Hawke... I've shown him it over the years, like, the assembly of where we are, and he made the observation. It's like, "oh, the kids"... 'cause it's really a brother and sister. He goes, over these 12 years, "they're growing up." And he looks at himself. "And we're aging." I've been... I've been thinking about this. Well, I always kind of wanted to write a book that all took place within the space of a pop song. You know, like three or four minutes long, the whole thing. The story, the idea, is that there's this guy, right? And he's totally depressed. His great dream was to be a lover, an adventurer, riding motorcycles through south America. And instead he's sitting at a marble table, eating lobster, and he's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right? You know, everything that he but it doesn't matter, 'cause what he wants is to fight for meaning. Happiness isn't in the doing, right? Not in the getting what you want. So, he's sitting there, and just that second, his little 5-year-old daughter hops up on the table, and he knows that she should get down, 'cause she could get hurt. But she's dancing to this pop song in a summer dress. And he looks down, and, all the sudden, he's 16. And his high school sweetheart is dropping him off at home, and they just lost their virginity, and she loves him. And the same song is playing on the car radio. And she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car. And now, now he's worried about and she's beautiful, with a...A facial expression just like his daughter's. In fact, you know, maybe that's why he even likes her. You see, he knows he's not remembering this dance. He's there. He's there in both moments simultaneously. And just like for an instant , all his life is just folding in on itself, and it's obvious to him that time is a lie. Uh... That it's all happening all the time, and inside every moment is another moment, all... You know, happening simultaneously. And, anyway, that's... that's kind of the idea... Anyway. The 18 years that's elapsed in the three "before" movies, that was kind of accidental. It just sort of happened that we liked working together, and we brought them back. It's not that conscious of a process, where I think your films are all about time. You're consciously sculpting these sections of time within this kind of a bleak narrative structures you're creating. Yeah, in '77, I made "one-way boogie woogie," and then I always thought, "oh, I" want to do this film again," because I made the film because it was in this industrial valley, and it was gonna become gentrified, and it didn't become gentrified right away. But, finally, 27 years later, it was beginning to change, and I thought, "okay, I can redo it" and then I decided, because I had a number of people on the first film, I'd get the same people if they were still alive to act in it. And I had not thought about how this would really talk about aging, because everybody's 27 years older now. That's a pretty big jump in for everybody. And in one place, there's a young woman carrying a baby, and now she's walking through with her 27-year-old child next to her, and she's an older woman. So, and then it really made me think about the whole experience of making the first film and then the experience of making the second film, which was so different because I was older. So, not only... I didn't realize I wouldn't be making only a film about the neighborhood changing, but it would be about my friends aging and myself being different. That's the one relationship we all have that endures to the end is our own relation with our past selves, you know, and the stories we create to connect ourselves to who we were. I've always been fascinated with that. Just talking about narrative and storytelling and the artificiality or the contrivance of it. But is there something innate in like, we all either... we're kind of creating these stories in our heads just about ourselves and our lives and trying to make them make sense somehow, even though it might not. Well, like I was saying at my screening the other day about I'm really interested in this idea of time itself, in that there's a future and there's a past, and we're always at that point that's present but that has no dimension. So, nothing can be understood in something that has no dimension. So, everything that we understand is only through memory, that my sentence, you cannot understand. You only remember it. You can't move on the timeline. You can't go into the future. You can only remember the past, but it's this machine that you either reinforce prejudice with, or you learn. But it's fun. Like, everybody who loves art can tell you that moment where they were confronted by something that they didn't understand, that literally blew their mind, that they just totally reoriented, recalibrated their mind of what a certain medium or what life could be, what anything could be. You know, so many categories. Yeah. I'll tell you my moment when that happened. I was in graduate school, in mathematics, and, like I said, I knew nothing about art until later in life. So, I knew nothing about art at this time. And I was going to an evening math class, and a bunch of people were going into the student union in Milwaukee, and somehow there was such an energy, I thought, "oh, I'm not" gonna go to my class. I'm gonna go to see what this and a guy came out, and he read an abridged thing of James Joyce, "finnegans wake," where he took James Joyce and wrote down this, and then he found the first words that started with a "j" but not an "a," and then he could add some words. So, he would pick just words out of the whole book, and then he read it, and it took him an hour and a half to read this. And "finnegans wake," the language is so difficult, anyway, but when it's chopped up and abstracted, it becomes just music. And by the end, I was totally engrossed in it. The audience clapped. He set down his book, and he put this big John cage smile on his face and looked at the audience. And I had no idea who John cage was, you know. Yeah. "Oh, this is so marvelous." I heard language as music, and I saw somebody perform something that was so unusual that I couldn't understand how anybody even could begin to think of doing that. And when I was done watching it, I was walking back to my car. I thought, "that's what I want" I want to do something that "makes me smile like that." It was absolutely incredible... Incredible experience. There's always these fortuitous events, where a dragonfly flies right in front of your camera, and it appears this big, and you either like that, or you don't. And then you keep those kinds of things in. But yes, I thought of each shot as some kind of an event, either event in the way light would change or the way the depth cue would change by a car moving through it, or the way the sound would disappear as a car would go deep into the frame, and your eye can't stop looking at it, and they still see it. These kind of games happen. So, it's kind of a playful movie. Where's the penitentiary? That's in central valley in California. They have 11 penitentiaries. Seven of them are privatized. They didn't come and stop you from parking out there? I shoot very quickly. I was worried because I shot the prison at Corcoran for another film, and I ended up with a gun at my head and being accused of a double felony of criminal trespassing and criminal surveillance. And I had known that two months earlier that Corcoran guards beat the shit out of a bunch of bad boys that were brought to that prison to be treated that way. And somehow it was all captured on some kind of video machine. And then, all those guards had just been arrested. So, I showed up a month later with my camera, and they, of course, thought I was gonna do something about the prison and how ugly it was. And I just wanted to show it because it's a maximum-security prison in the valley, and there's many of them, and it's more lucrative to grow criminals now than to grow cotton. Technology has allowed me to become completely autonomous in my work, that I don't need labs anymore, and I can do... once I buy my equipment, and I know it doesn't last as long as a Bolex lasted, but it might last seven or eight years. I can work almost for free for the next seven or eight years. I just need the cost of a little gasoline and a sandwich, and then all the rest I can do myself. So, in one sense, the technology has made me completely autonomous. And then, in another sense, I think it's completely suffocating and keeps you from really the maybe more important things in life that are closer to life itself, like, growing your own food and building your house and caring for things. And now it's... I have a Facebook. Come be my friend if you like. It's a funny business. I want to tell you about a dream I once had. I know when someone says that, that's usually you're in for a very boring next few minutes, and you might be. I got to tell you about this dream I had last night. Oh, yeah? What's that? Do you ever have those dreams that are just completely real? Okay, there I am, and I'm getting it on... with this perfect female uh-huh. But... What? What? What? Come on, a perfect female body. It's not a bad start. But the head of Abraham Lincoln. I was just traveling around, staring out the windows of buses and trains, reading. I mean, how many dreams do you have where you read in a dream? I read this essay by Philip k. Dick. What, you read it in your dream? Man, there was this book I just read on the bu... What are you reading? Oh, yeah. How about you? Um... Oh. Hmm. Man, it was bizarre. It was, like, the premise for this whole book was that every thought you have creates its own reality. Another example would be like back there at the bus station. As I got off the bus, the thought crossed my mind, just for a second, about not taking a cab at all. I mean, at this very second, I'm back at the bus station, just hanging out, probably thumbing through a paper, probably going up to a pay phone. Say this beautiful woman just comes up to me, just starts talking to me, you know? She ends up offering me a ride. We're hitting it off. Go play a little pinball. Merde! Well, um... We haven't talked about this yet, but are you dating anyone? If we were meeting for the first time today on a train, would you find me attractive? Of course. No, but, really, right now, as I am, would you start talking would you ask me to get off the train with you? Well, I mean, you're asking a theoretical question. I mean, what would my life situation be? I mean, technically, wouldn't I be cheating on you? Okay, why can't you just say I did. I said, "of course." No, no, no, I wanted you to say something romantic. Say I have a dream some night, that I'm with some strange woman I've never met, or I'm living at some place I've never seen before. See, that's just a momentary glimpse into this other reality that was all created back there at the bus station, you know? And then, I could have a dream from that reality into this one, that, like, this is my dream from that reality. Of course, that's kind of like that dream I just had on the bus, the whole cycle type of thing. Man, shit, I should have stayed at the bus station. Good morning. Hey. Good morning. How are you? Good. So... I'm excited. You're excited? We've talked about this project on and off for ten years. So... Ten or eleven. And your daughter has a part in this? Yeah. It was a tough thing casting. I got such a long-term thing. And she was excited to be in the film... Initially, and as the years went by, she was like, "hey, can" you... can my character, like, "die?" And I'm like, "no, sorry." Go off to college. And every year... yeah. Every year... she's a painter, visual artist. She doesn't like acting. She's the kind of kid, like, I think most teenage girls... you take a picture, they get your phone and erase it immediately. So self-conscious. But she's actually very effective in the movie. It's working with a lot of nonactors. And it's weird to be working with Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the parents... Consummate professionals. And then, on another level, a lot of the kids, their friends, will be people we just sort of pick up and try to meld into the whole project. This narrative structure came about... we were talking about problem solving the other day. The problem I had was I wanted to do a film about childhood, but I couldn't really... I didn't think I had anything big to say about any one moment of childhood. I had feelings about it, but... And I was actually sitting down. I was thinking I was gonna write a novel, something I never did. But I aspired to many, many years ago. And it was that idea about what place in childhood do you drop in? This idea popped in my head. It's like, "well, why couldn't" you just film a little bit every "year and touch on these things?" But that was kind of the big idea. And just kind of put these episodes, these years, together and have it flow as one. And that would make a much bigger statement about time and maturity and how we change, how we stay the same. You know, those are the bigger themes I think I was reaching I just couldn't find the narrative format for that in could we look at how you... I don't know if you have good examples of it yet, but how you get from one year to the next, what the articulation is? Some are real subtle. Some are less subtle than others. I think the biggest one... year one, I think I was, if anything, too blunt about it. I got more subtle, I think. This is year one to two. Yeah, this was what I was describing. New apartment. They've moved in, or they've just arrived, tired. Well, what do you think? I like it. Oh, can I see my room? Yeah, let's see your rooms. Bus will be here in ten minutes. Yeah, that works. So, we follow him out. I didn't realize, when you described this, how interesting those ellips... missing time would be. Okay, here's years two to three. He's just met a professor. He was home from school. Went with his mom to class. She's getting her degree, and he's walking away. You can get near the end of this. She's... Thanks. So, do you think... So, he kind of realizes his mom's sort of dating this guy, or there's something else going on. ♪ ...said to the sand man, ♪ "wake up" ♪ ♪ one, two, three, four, five... ♪ And then, there he is, on the trampoline. Changed pretty abruptly. Samantha's got braces, his older sister. And there's these other two kids around. And we come back to realize the parents have just come back from their honeymoon. So, they're in a different family situation. I know, right? Look at those. Ooh, look at those. There's a 10-year payoff here somewhere. So, I'm kind of getting scenes from boyhood I actually remember. Like, here he is, like, a bird has died. He buried it, and he's dug it back up just to see what it looks like. You know, that kind of... Over the ten years, is this all shot on film? Mm-hmm. 35 neg. Really, the goal was to have a very uniform look to everything about it, which was, given the limitations of each year's shoot and our budget and everything, but I did want... I figured, looking back, like, "okay", twelve years from now, I think film will still be here. At least it'll be available, I know there will be cameras. There will probably be one lab and it looks like we're getting to the finish line in a year where it really is sort of at the end for film. Yeah, that's interesting. I don't feel a need to stock if you would have started on digital... digital changed so we'd be on our fifth different look. Yeah, exactly. And I didn't want it to feel like that. I didn't want that to be the thing that demarcated the years. You two have been working together for many years, right? I heard about Rick making a film with universal, and I wrote him a letter. Uh-huh. Just wrote him a longhand letter and said, "I'm new to" town, but I have experience in the editing room, and I'd really "like to meet you." And I just mailed it to the address of your production office, and they called about three weeks later and... 'cause I was very skeptical. I had always edited everything, and the idea of working with an editor really scared me. It's like, "oh, is that where" you lose control of your film? "Is that where..." You hear these horror stories. I was very paranoid at that moment just working with a studio in general. And I think it came down to one of my producers out there... "yeah, a buddy of mine, he cut" the 'police academy' movies. I think he'd be good to cut I was like, "aah!" The older I get, the less. Patience I have to be in an editing room all day. I think that first film, I was like right over your shoulder, just like with the thing, like, "don't screw up my movie." Then, I quickly realized Sandra had actually a lot to offer. Mm-hmm. You probably weren't here yet, when the film society was just beginning. Those were wonderful times. I was staying at d. Montgomery's house. She gave me a house to stay in, and Rick drove me to her house. And we're dreaming, and we stop at a stop sign, and there's a bump we hear. And there was a guy that had been drunk and crawled in the backseat and was sleeping. And he fell and woke up. And Rick's like this wasn't abnormal at all. He said, "what are you doing?" He said, "I was just sleeping" Rick said, "well, go back to" I'll take you back after I drop "him off." And I thought, "welcome to" Austin." Yeah. Yeah, you would fit in just fine, just fine in Austin. But I liked that you didn't lose a beat on that, like, "no big deal." And how did you meet d.? I had seen her around. She was friends with Teresa Taylor, who's the drummer for the butthole surfers, and she would be at parties. And I asked her actually to be in my first film. I think of d. Every day, and I still have dreams sometimes that we're sitting there talking, and she'll have these... That's how vibrant she was. Yeah, yeah. And she'll be telling me about a project she's working on. "And then I'm gonna do"... you know, something kind of really conceptual, and I'll be really into it. You're making me cry. And then I kind of get lucid, and I'm like, "oh, that sounds" great, d. You know you're not alive "anymore, right?" Then, I'll have to inform her, and she's like... that kind of kills the... "I am, too!" Yeah, she's like, "I am, in" your mind, at least." But it is a cool idea, but I'm kind of like, "oh, yeah, damn." This isn't real." So, yeah. She's been gone 16, 15 1/2 years now, so... Long time. And then, I could pick you up and take you to our house for... Okay. For dinner. That would be great. Then, we'll go up to the big "m." You know what's that from, don't you? The "m"? Yeah, we'll go up to the big "m." In Montana. Yeah. Is that in Missoula? Missoula. I like that trip up there in your film, though, because it's kind of matter-of-fact. "What should we do?" "Oh, let's go up to the big" yeah, we can walk up to the the ultimate hanging-out... So, well, cool. So, I'll just come get you. I'll be waiting for you. I'll call you. I'll call you sometime after 4:00, I believe. Around 4:30, cool. Yeah. All right. Take it easy. Okay. See you soon. Cut it! [Bird squawking 1 I found the end of "school of rock" to be extremely radical, to put on this addition at the end of them jamming. We improvised that. Yes. I kind of like credit sequences that keep you in the theater, for some reason. There is an addendum to the and that, we had spent so much time in the studio, recording all the music, and they were sort of jamming. Jack and the kids were doing these jams to ac/dc songs. And I could see what fun they were having. It just popped in my head, 'cause we didn't really have much of an ending. We were sort of defying the Hollywood... oh, the new rules of endings that you have to have, like, six endings to every we really had a pretty simple they lost, and then, they got called out for an encore. So, we had a half an ending, which I'm always in... that hurt "dazed and confused" a lot way like, it wasn't seen that we had an ending, and I was like, "yeah, there isn't an ending. Isn't that cool?" And they're like, "no, that's" you need a good ending." "Well, I don't have one." They're driving off to get "Aerosmith tickets."
