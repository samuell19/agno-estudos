Would you care to pitch a really, really big client? That's why I'm here. Alt colors, go, close them. Cutting it ever so close, aren't we, Thomas? I didn't think you got nervous. If you used your office, you wouldn't always be running late. And I would never see my family. Are we set? You got structurals, skins, and the interiors here, and topography ( indistinct ) are on the screen. How about the budget? All taken care of-- Mr. Franklin approved. Subcontractors? Bonded, licensed, and approved. Huh, you wouldn't be after my job, would you? Don't patronize me. Yeah. Shall we? Succubus first. Gentlemen, ladies, I give you the lead designer on the architectural project of the Natural History Museum, Tom Paulson. ( Tom clears throat ) Ladies, gentlemen. History is happening right now. And if we don't learn from our mistakes, well, we're doomed to repeat them. Architecture is no different. ( indistinct chattering ) Okay? Thank you so much-- You were amazing. You're good. Well. I got to go put out a fire at the New York office. Just make sure you get the final plan uploaded by Monday morning. It's done. Home run on this one. Both of you. Oh, we learned from the best. Molly, you might want to have him wipe that shit off his nose. So did I impress you? Maybe just a little. Tom. That was a pitch. Cocky charisma, baby. ( chuckles ) I see why you love him. It's a good thing you're talented. I'm out of here. Yeah. You want to celebrate? I can't do that. I'll let you be rough. I know how much you liked that last time. ( cell phone ringing ) Hello?

Sell the damn house. And don't call me until you have an offer. It's just not a good time to sell. We're gonna be fine. All right? We're gonna be fine. Got a month and a half, stretch it out to two months, and then obviously, your dad's help is huge. Not to mention how understanding Mr. Franklin has been about this entire situation. He still me wants me to be the lead on that San Francisco project that I was telling you about and those guys, those guys are doing two more projects at the end of the year in Tampa and Dallas, so-- so we're good. We are... good. How close are we now? Close, sweetie. Dad? Hey, what did your mother just say? Hey, does that look familiar? Thank you. Hey! Grandpa! ( laughing ) Is this my little Roger? Oh, boy! You're like an oak. Be careful, Dad. He's heavy. Hey, how long is it since I embraced my grandson? TOGETHER: Too long. What about me? Here. Oh, I'm so happy to have you all. Mmm. Me, too. Erik. You're looking good. As do you, sir. Thank you for doing this. Hey, I'd do anything for my family. ( sighs ) I need to get Roger settled. Sleep's just been a challenge for all of us. Come on, monkey. But, mom, I want to see the cabin with Grandpa. Hey, come here. And so you will. I'll show you things few have seen. Things never imagined in a horrible land like Los Angeles. But that's tomorrow, my boy. Tonight, you'll sleep cradled by Niorun, and dream of victories in Valhalla. I am Thor! No nightmares, Dad. Come on, let's go. Mom... Hey, buddy, listen to your mom. You sure you can handle that? I'm not that feeble yet, Thomas. Tell me, honestly... how is she doing? It's been a rough couple of weeks, but she's strong. This is what she needs now. Finally, we agree. But this would never have happened-- Oh, Jesus, here we go. I asked one thing of you, Thomas. Yeah, for me to abandon my job, my career, One thing! my life just so you could be close to her? To protect her! Something you clearly couldn't do. I love her just as much as you do. Do you? Something tells me that's not true. Everything that your daughter has asked of me, I have given her--everything. And right now she wants to be home, so guess what? Here I am. ( sighs ) It's been a long ride. You want to have it out, fine. Can we do it later? Right now I got a 10-year-old who hates brushing his teeth. ( sighs ) You don't have to give up the whole house for us, Dad. You don't need an old man interfering right now. You don't even have a phone in the cabin. ( sighs ) He's finally asleep. Sounds like a good idea. Good night, Dad. Good night, my dear. This feeling, it's just not going away. ( sighs ) It's gonna take some time. Hey. Hey. You're home now. Okay? We are home. We are, aren't we? ( woman whispering indistinctly ) ( gasping ) ( gagging ) ( vomits ) ROGER: How come I never met her? She died when I was your age. How? Do you want to place the flowers? Just set them on the stone. Yep, just like that. Aren't they gonna die? That's what makes them special. If we had them forever, we wouldn't appreciate them. ROGER: I'm hungry. BRENDA: Tom? Tom. Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry. Yeah, I'll take him. You need some time? I'm gonna go by Mom's shop. We'll find you later. It's just me and you, bud. Beauty and youth. She was a good woman. You knew my mom? Very well, Brenda. I'm sorry. I don't really know who you are. My name is Beyla. Nice to meet you, Beyla. Raidho. For a safe journey. Thank you. I hope we can talk again. I would enjoy sharing stories about your mother. Let me take your number. No need to go to the trouble. I know it's in here somewhere. ( grunts ) How are those chicken toes? Fingers, Dad. What kind of shop is it? Dad? Huh? Uh... What kind of shop is it? Uh, your grandmother owned a flower shop. Is Mom going to work there? I don't know. Maybe. You boys doing okay? Yes, I think we are, thank you. Well, if you need anything, I am just a wink away. Can I work there? You're 10 years old, turkey. What? What's wrong with the shop? ( raven caws ) TOM: Excuse me. I am so sorry for the wait. No, that's okay. Can we get a chicken sandwich to-go, please, and the check? WAITRESS: Oh, absolutely. Are you sure I can't get anything else? No, thank you. No? Okay. Thank you guys. She's really nice. Everyone here seems nice. Finish up, bud. WAITRESS: All right. One sandwich to go. Do you have a bakery or a candy shop in town? MAN: Excuse me. I need-- You got to get-- ( man coughing ) WAITRESS: You know what? It's just out the door to the left, just a couple blocks south. Thank you guys so much. I hope to see you again soon. Come back if you can again. ( woman whispering indistinctly ) Dad, is there something still wrong with Mom? ( sighs ) Come here, bud. Remember last month when Mom had her accident? Well, that left her-- left her tired. Okay? So right now we're just gonna have to help her out, all right? ROGER: How? TOM: Being patient. Now, if you see her, and she's looking sad, then just...go up and give her a hug, let her know you love her. Sh--she's gonna be fine. ( raven caws ) Oh, no. ( knocking at door ) Come in. Come in. Please. Wow. I can't remember the last time I was out here. Well, you didn't care much for it growing up. ( chuckles ) Are you sure you're okay out here? There's plenty of room in the house, and Roger would love to have you close. Hey... I have everything I need here now. My daughter came home. Dad... What is it? Talk to me. I feel ashamed. Like it was my fault. But it's not just that. I feel like I keep seeing things, ( stammers ) and I don't know-- I don't know if they're memories, or if I'm just making stuff up in my head. What sort of things? Mom. When she died... I just... I don't know. Oh, listen... you made the right choice coming here. Tom made the right choice, too. TOM: Are you drawing that for Mom? This is me, and you, and Mom. She's gonna like that one. This is the big old tree in the cemetery, only I made it the way it's supposed to look. What do you mean, "the way it's supposed to look"? The way I see it in my mind. What about this one? That's Beyla and her family. Who's Beyla? She lives here. What's that above her? That's a runes. Runes? Yeah. Magic from the book Grandpa gave me. ( scoffs ) Magic, huh? Pictures that make things happen. Where is this... ( thud ) Roger, just stay here. ( creaking ) ( ravens cawing ) ( fluttering ) ( screeching ) Ah! Tom! ( coughing ) Get up. What happened? I heard a noise. I came out. God, you are ice cold. Let's get him inside. ( Roger shrieking ) Roger! Go! I got him. Come on. Some babysitter I turned out to be, huh? First time I'm alone with him in like, forever, can't even protect him-- little spider. Well, in my defense, he does scream like a little girl. I still don't understand why you left him alone. It could've been serious. I told you, I heard a loud noise, and I looked out, thought I saw a-- He wasn't alone more than five minutes. Well, it doesn't matter now. He's okay. I'm just gonna sleep in there tonight. Brenda... I love you. ( sighs ) ( woman whispering indistinctly ) ( Erik sighs ) ERIK: How is he? ( sighs ) Fine. I can sleep tonight on the couch if you like. Please. Of course. Dad, do you know a woman named Beyla? She said she knew Mom. They were very close. Mom never mentioned her. Well, your mom had secrets like anyone else. Who is she? Her family's been in the area for ages. Your mom used to discuss their... mutual lineage. But she's so young. Apparently, they shared a descendant. Like many of the people around here, she was very proud of her Viking heritage. Where did you see her? At the cemetery. She said she hoped we could talk. It's a long story. I'll tell you about it sometime, but not tonight. ( groans ) I am gonna make some tea. ( sighs ) Mommy? What are you doing up? I'm scared. Sweetie, what are you scared of? There's nothing to be scared about there. ( mutters ) Just a tree. See, there's nothing-- oh! ( raven caws ) ( sighs ) It's fine, okay? Just a bird. See? Everything's fine, okay? Come here--I promise you. Look at this, here, do you remember this from Grandpa's book? This is an Algiz. All gaze? Close. It's a really old symbol that protects little children from bad things. Really? It protected me when I was little. Now it'll protect you. All gaze. Are you feeling any better? It's late. Why don't you lay back down? I'll stay with you while you sleep. Come on.

Something's... something's off. You're gonna have to be a little more specific than that, Tom. ( sighs ) Look, why don't you just go down and make some coffee...? I'll be down in a minute. Morning. Morning, Mom. How'd you sleep? Good. How about you, Dad? Was the couch okay? Sleep is for city folk. How's Tom? He's okay. I think. TOM: Feeling better. Still tired. Hungry. ( imitates eating ) ( yells playfully ) I'm actually starving. Mmm. TOM: Probably-- probably have to go to the store today. ERIK: How about this? You two go into town for provisions... and Roger can babysit me for the day. Look, Erik, you don't have to do that. No, no, we didn't move back here so you could spend your retirement as a babysitter. We've got some catching up to do, don't we, Ulfhéinn? ( roars ) Okay. I'll get ready. Thanks, Dad. But no cabin.

What matters is you are here, and for that, I am joyful. Would you like some tea? Sure. Good. Then we will talk and we'll have some tea. But your shop... Will be fine. Now come. Oh! Sorry, I... I didn't see you. You should pay more attention to your surroundings. Yeah. You're-- you're right. I should. I know you. Do you? You were-- you were at the cemetery. I was. You were visiting a loved one? My wife was-- was her mother... I'm sorry for her loss. But I'm happy that you're here. ( woman whispering indistinctly ) ( horn honking ) BEYLA: Please sit. Make yourself comfortable. I unsettle you. That is not my intent. I just wish to be friends as your mother and I were. BRENDA: How long did you know her? Long enough to know that you are Eisa's daughter. You must have been really young. I'm not as young as you think. Tending bluebells and marsh violets in her flower shop was my first summer employ. We later became friends. It just, uh, seems really odd to me that she never mentioned you before she passed. Indeed. Now this will make it better. What is it? Angelica, birch, and Icelandic moss. It was Eisa's favorite. Mmm. Never had anything like this. I make it myself. ( gasps ) Are you okay? ( sighs ) I'm sorry. I just have a... lot of feelings and, um... past memories of this place since I'm back. I don't know... There's no need to be sorry. You miss her. I see that. You said that the two of you would talk for hours. My dad said the same thing. What would you talk about? ROGER: Grandpa, who made the runes? Ah. That is a very interesting question, my boy. Did you know that we are the last in a long line of a proud Viking family? Really? Mmm. The men who truly discovered these woods before--before the English, before the Spaniards, were of the line of Ingold of Roskilde. However, as fierce and determined as they were, they were not explorers. Colonies were set up in hundreds of locations, but they all fell to disease and famine. Then how did we come from them? Some... used the power of the runes to shield off evil, protect their families. They stayed together... and found a way to survive. Family...is everything, Roger. Always remember that. Roger? ERIK: Roger! What are you doing? Come on, let's get back to the house. Your mother will be home soon. BEYLA: As rumor has it, some colonies fled as far away as Oklahoma. Others further still. Vikings in Oklahoma? Even I don't believe that, but there are some who claim to have found rune stones properly dated. And Thornby? As the story is told, one colony thrived like no other. That is until the day they took in a group of travelers. The colony welcomed their brothers and sisters, including... a witch. Before too long, war broke out. Brother fought brother, father killed son. The colony was in ruins, and the witch and her followers fled to the forest. As they fled, they were followed by the witch's son, a warrior of great strength but of different... spirit. ( no audible dialogue ) The warrior pursued his mother across the lands until he accosted her near where today, supposedly, lies this very town. ( no audible dialogue ) The two were engaged in battle and gravely wounded. It is said that the warrior son died where he fell, and was left, and never received the Viking funeral that he deserved. No valkyrja ushered him to Valhalla, so Hel cursed him... earthbound forever. BRENDA: And his mother, the witch? They say that she carried on until she came to the giant oak tree that you see in the cemetery. And it is there, under the oak, that she died-- her body buried beneath the great roots of the tree so she may never escape. Once she passed, all those who were under her spell were free, and they settled the land, living peaceful lives. All that sounds so... so--I've--I never heard any of that in school. ( chuckling ) No, of course not. And it's just a story. I can see why my mother loved hearing them. She was always telling me stories as a child. I gave your mother a book of stories, and she treasured it deeply. An old book? Leather? Yes. I found that book. Excellent. I had hoped that she would pass it on to you and when you feel it is time, for you to pass it to Rodgeirr. There was a picture of you in it. Well, not me. An ancestor, perhaps. What's it about? Traditions, rituals, cultures. It is about family. Do you know the runes? Some. My dad used to have a set. Each one holds a special meaning, certain power. Some say that if you hold a rune in merkstave, reverse, its meaning becomes dark. Negative. Take the Thurisaz for example. Now as you see it, the Thurisaz represents instinctual will. But in merkstave... represents betrayal. Rape. If you like, I could teach you the runes as I taught your mother. I-I think I'd like that. Good. Good. Then it is settled. For now, the hour grows late? Late? Before you go, I have one more thing for you. I can't accept that. Hush. You can. You will. Let me fasten it. It will give you strength for what is to come. It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for coming home. ( no audible dialogue ) What you do...? Looking at pictures. Scoot over. You know, I made this specially for you. Let me show you something. What is it? See these? These are photos of your grandmother. Let me see. This is the day we got married. She looks pretty. Mmm. Yeah, she was very pretty. Just like your mom. Just like you. I'm not pretty, I'm a boy! You are? Grandpa. ( chuckles ) Now this-- this is the day we moved to Thornby. And do you know who this is? Who? That's your mother. She was a baby? Mmm. Yes, she was. That's Beyla. Who? Her. I drew her. Beyla... Beyla was a friend of your grandmother's. She... ( car door shuts ) I think your parents are finally home. ( grunts ) ROGER: Mommy! TOM: Brenda. TOM: Brenda. Brenda! Get your hand off me. Give her time. Dad, is something wrong with Mom? No--Mom's gonna be fine, buddy, okay? She's gonna go up, she's gonna take a nap. She's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine, because we're home, right? Saying it doesn't mean it's gonna happen. Yeah, well, nothing else seems to be working. Roger, go upstairs and pack your bag. Like a sleepover? The hell he is. You're not going anywhere. Stay right there. Do you really think I'm the enemy here? You need to go and work this out. I'll give you the night. Roger, go pack a bag. Hey, don't forget a toothbrush. Okay, fine. What are your ideas then? What do you suggest, huh? Go to her and fix it. "Fix it"? Fix what? Huh? Fix wha-- I have no idea what's wrong with her. She won't even talk to me! You know, I thought coming back here was gonna make things better, but it hasn't. It's made it worse. It's made it more distant for me. This doesn't feel right. It has never felt right here. It never will until the two of you can get through this. Why do you even care? Because she's my daughter, and I love her. I love her too, okay? And that's not gonna change. No matter how many stones you throw. I'm gonna ignore your ranting. I'm gonna take my grandson for the night, and you will stop whining like a little bitch and go fix your marriage to my daughter. Because if you think I hate you, just imagine how I feel at the thought of my daughter being made unhappy... by you. ( door slams ) Love you, Mom. Where's Grandpa? He's outside waiting. Dad, are you and Mom gonna get a divorce? Where did you hear that word? Shelly, in school. Her parents got a divorce, and now she has two Hanukkahs. ( sighs ) Listen... I promise you, I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure that your mom and I stay together for as long as we live. Okay? ( mutters ) I love you, Rog. Now you be good for your grandpa. I will. All right. All ready, Grandpa. ( softly ) Brenda? Brenda. Go away. No. Talk to me. There's nothing to talk about. What do you mean, "There's nothing to talk about"? ( cell phone ringing ) Go away. I want to help. I know, but... I just can't do this. Look, I love you, and I am not gonna go away until you talk to me. Get... Stop it. ...off me. Stop this. Okay? Stop it! Listen to me. Let me go! No. Stop it. Stop! ( heart beating ) ( yelling ) ( yelling ) ( distorted roaring ) ( breathing heavily ) ( sobbing ) ( breathing rapidly ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, I'm sorry. Fuck you! Brenda. I was raped! A man came up from behind me, grabbed my throat, threw me on the ground, and fucked me! And do you want to know what the sickest, most vile part of the whole rape, Tom? Do you? As he was spreading my legs, I swear, I got wet. I didn't just take it. I liked it. I enjoyed it. I came twice as he violated me. I've never felt so good and so bad at the same time. Do you have any idea what that must feel like? No, you don't. Okay, so now you know, okay-- now you know why I can't just open up-- Why I can't just talk it away, okay? My insides are twisted. My mind is a wreck. And as much as I love you, you cannot fix me. Tell me what I can do to help. Tell me what I can do. No, just--I need to get out of here. ( cell phone ringing ) What can I do to help? ( indistinct ) Tom. Where? Not here. Just wait--tell me where you're gonna be so I know you're safe. ( yells ) ( door shuts ) ( knocking on door ) I'm sorry. I-I didn't know where else to go. Please, come in. I'll be glad to have you. ( woman whispering indistinctly ) I hope this is comfortable enough. It's fine. Now, tell me what has happened. I don't think I can. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, it's just... It's okay. You'll tell me in your own time. ( sighs ) Thank you. I don't know how I can ever repay you. Don't be silly. You owe me nothing. Just the fact that you've returned and you've brought the book is enough for me. I did. I-- I knew this was the only place I could go, and I just felt compelled to grab it. May I? Of course. Such a beautiful book. You said that you taught my mom how to read it? Yes. She was an excellent student. I told her many things. She was very eager to learn. What else? Mythology. History. Worship. Love. ( woman whispering indistinctly ) Why am I here? Where else do you want to be? In bed. Alone? No. Who with, Tom? With...who, Tom? You. ( moaning ) They are mine, Tom. And now, so are you. Now do you see? Yes. ( sighs ) ( breathing deeply ) ( yells ) ( growling ) You can't defeat me. Oh, really? Watch this. Aah... Grandpa, something's burning. ERIK: That's because I don't usually cook for other people. Oh, no. Oh... Roger! Tom?! Where are you?! Tom! "Tell Roger I love him. I'll be back." Hello, Erik. It's been a long time. Not long enough, Beyla. Where's Tom? Gone for now. And Rodggeir? You leave him alone. Where is he? ( woman whispering indistinctly ) Good. Make sure you call me next time you're in town for a little scotch and soda. Cheers. Mr. Franklin. TOM: Mr. Franklin. Please sit. I apologize for meeting here, but there are some issues in the Miami office that need my attention, and I have to fly there today. At least some things have never changed. This is our offer for you to return to the Los Angeles firm full time. Uh-- I'm sorry. I-- I thought this was about a new project in San Francisco. No more freelance, Tom. You'll be the lead architect in Los Angeles. All the details are inside. Sit, have lunch. Molly will finalize all the details. Yes, sir. MR. FRANKLIN: I look forward to your return. You're one of our best and always have been. Thank you, sir. Don't fuck this up. ( door opens ) ( door shuts ) You want to tell me what happened? What do you mean? Why you look like you're running on empty? It's nothing. Fine. You know who says "I'm fine"? People who aren't. Don't psycho-analyze me, Molly. Oh, I don't want to do anything to you, Tom, except make you happy. ( giggles ) But before you even speak, I think you should know that I've been instructed not to take "no" as an acceptable answer.
