A wonderful world was hidden under the surface of the sea. The sea anemones, billowing clouds of algae, Mysterious, colourful realm of calm and silence. All it takes is a roll of a single wave - for things to change. Accompanied by the whirling of ship's propellers people are devastating the oceans. Some fish take refuge in the cool depths of the sea, others find their fate in fishing nets. And some leave for the world of humans. Thus the ruler of the local seas decided to move ashore, into exile. He locked the doors to his underwater palace and headed toward a port, together with his old mother and three daughters. This is a story about the Sea King and mainly about his youngest daughter, Little. A story about great love. A dockside story. Noise, music, yelling, hustle and bustle. Sailors, outcasts and vendors from every corner of the world - all packed in one alley. The air is infused with the smell of spices, rum, sadness and hope. This is the Harbor District. That is why the King has opened his fish shop in this very place, to always feel the salty taste of sea. Poor Little. Her folks told her she was too young to leave the house. And there is so much going on outside! Tinker, tailor... A backstreet dealer... And look at that odd fish over there. Who's the small, harmless fish and who's the shark? The waiter from across the street is a slimy character. Always trying to get on the good side of the King. He has his eye on a different kind of catch - the three mermaids working out back. It is time to feed Precious, memory of happy times long ago in a palace. The King's everyday small pleasure. How do you spell bad news? B, for Bogan. With cold-blooded eyes to match his cold-headed cash. God knows why that diva on his hip thinks the snake looks so good. Bogan's turned Little's head, too, she looks hypnotized. And Bogan knows full well what prize'll be waiting for him over at the fish shop. Every night, the two sisters would make their rounds delivering freshly prepared fish delicacies to nearby bars and pubs. Little can't wait until she turns 16. When she gets to join her sisters out in the big world beyond the shop's window shutters, What? Don't you feel it'? It's always a party in the Harbor District. Every day, Middle would bring Little her favourite banana and tell her everything about the night before. Little always imagined all the known and unknown faces, places and things. It was like watching a movie - somewhere, unreal. Like, one big dream! Her 16th birthday. Today, Little gets the Pearl of Adulthood! Will it change her? She's about to find out what the dreamed-up world beyond the window shutters really looks like. What kind of neon lights are out there. Sparkling new colors of starfish? Or unexpected traps? And what about Daddy? He didn't forget! "What's up, little girl, fancy a herring?" "How do you do'? Here, my little lady, a lantern of wishful thinking." The ocean is a kingdom lost. Memories out like shattered glass for the King and the Queen Mother. A vague, distant past for Little. She wants to live right here- in the Harbor District. Right now- among all these bizarre two-leggers. Where will the delicate lantern arrive at? Will Little's secret wish come true? How did they end up here? None of them planned to walk down this street lined with night clubs. Except,one surprise turn, can sometimes change your life. Today is the first day Little will do her rounds, delivering seafood. Who could Little turn to about what happened yesterday? Middle gave up a piece of her mind, about Bogan and his neon heart sign. Only Little wouldn't listen. Scales had already grown over eyes. The sweet young fool was in love. "Is it easy to become human?" Little asked her grandmother. "Child! What made you ask that?" "A man should love you so much, that you were more to him than anyone and anything in the whole world and what's more: you would have to seek out an old witch, who lives underground in the sewers, and give her the most precious thing you have, for a pair of human legs." Every year, the King holds the feast of the Green Lanterns; Albeit now in more humble surroundings. But when family and friends crowd around and there's a little something to nibble on and drink and when the Fish Orchestra strikes up a tune!'?! Well... life ain't half bad! With every step, Little felt she would cry out loud! Ii was like walking on sea urchins and the spikes of bass! She was ready to pay for her dream to come true. Little was human now. And that meant... no turning back. Grandma, don't get mad. Daddy, forgive me. Sisters, I love you so much! Welcome to Bogan's lair. Kingdom of nightlife and fun in the dark. Women, clients, booze, and more women, more clients, more booze. Have you seen Little? What happened to Precious? Our Little... The club has a new boss. Little is her name! Back at the shop, Mr. Guess Who, has already filled in for Little. But has Middle really taken his bait? Or has the waiter taken hers? Little was happy, the nightclub a hit, and Bogan'? He was just fine. Ant then, one day, Bogan kicked out a girl who had the nerve to get pregnant! Little had to help her out. It was the human thing to do. Or was it? "Began?" "The waiter?" "For now..." Middle pleaded with Little to leave Bogan and that club and ditch that whole seedy street, and come back home. But no use. So Middle switched the subject, and told Little about her, say, unsteady waiter boyfriend, and about everyone back at home. It was like watching a movie again. Only this time, the picture looked real. This one, hit Little straight in the heart. Forgiveness and Bogan mixed like oil and water. Plus he already had his fill of Little. The tide comes in, and the tide goes out. The waiter seems a little too unserious about his less-than-serious relationship with Middle. And just like that, the club had a new boss. Again. Little can't make heads or tails of what's going on. "I guess it's normal for humans to always have to fight for love." [IA gift!" "If you know where Little is, just bring the girl home!" "Come on,let's hit the road!" But Little had to stay. There was just no turning back from the choice she'd made. "Take a banana at least." Go find that witch. Maybe she can get us out of this mess. To save Little's life, her sisters had to give up their living hair, in exchange for a knife. A knife made of metal hard as the sea. It was simple. Little had until daybreak to kill Bogan. Kill him, your fish tail grows back, and you get to go back to your loving family. But, if she doesn't make Bogan pay for his betrayal, Little will die at dawn's first light. Just finish him! Then you can come back. And so, our port story must end. Little was human for just a short while. She lived long enough, to know the betrayal, and paid the ultimate price. No. No happily ever after, here. But Little lived out her big dream. She fell in love-- wild, burning loveÂ» and tasted pure happiness. Who are you, who is anybody to say-- for just a little while doesn't count? So the next time the foam of the sea, cools you with its touch, remember Little. No matter how far, how stormy the ocean-- chase your dreams, risk it all. For life, for hope, for love. Just sail out, wherever it takes you. Anchors up!
