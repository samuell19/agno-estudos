Sonia, let's go soon. I was afraid you would not come ... For cars! It's B│ok. I marked there in the book ... Goodbye, Sonia ... It is mandatory to write. Sonia did not receive his letter. He died at the end of October from all your companions, in the composition of one of Moscow the mass-launch division in the circle of WiaЯm╣. So yes ... Listen to me. A replacement for the duration of the operation I appointed a younger Sergeant Osjaninъ. If an enemy is detected, or something unclear ... Who can imitate an animal or a bird? I am seriously asking! In a forest, information cannot be given with a voice. Germany has ears too. I can. Like a donkey. Osw a lot ... Okay, let's get quacks. Like ducks. This is how the drake calls the female. - You speak well! The signals will be as follows: twice: ATTENTION - I see the enemy. Three times - everyone to me. Sure? For me. WaЬkow realized that That if the target of the Germans there is a diversion on the Kirov railway line - one of the most important transport arteries, which was delivered from the Allies to the front ... This stopping them isn't just that task of local importance. A turn to Lake Wope, which was discovered by WaЬkow still during the Finnish war The Germans could not know there were only swamps on the maps. So the Germans had a turn only one way. To the lake via Siniuchin╣ │╣kъ. And it was impossible for them to miss those little marks. Well, the Germans are marching. Very good, even. About 40 km. Come on ... Your father and mother live somewhere, are you an orphan I am an orphan. You could say an orphan ... You're not sure yourself? And Who Is Sure Now, Comrade Sergeant? You're right. My parents are in Minsk, I studied in Moscow, I was preparing for the session. and suddenly... Do you have a photo? What are you guys? Parents are hesitating? Naturally. Naturally? If it were natural, I wouldn't be asking. Sonia did not know and she couldn't know That her mother, Wiera Josifowna Gurwicz, at that time she was wearing on the chest the ╣thъ starъ and the number soulless number of the camp Little Trostiniec. Neither her father nor her sister She was no longer alive. Maybe they got lost? Private Gurwicz, acidify three times. Why? To check combat readiness. Did you forget how I taught? No, I have not forgotten. what happened If anything happened ... The Archangels would already be you in that world they greeted. You run like calves. With a raised tail ... What did you see along the way? Gray order: younger sergeant Osjanin ... Probably nothing ... She was at the turn z│aman╣ ga│╣Я. Bravo. Truth. Closing? I didn't notice anything. Everything's fine. Dew is knocked off the bushes. On the left he is holding but on the right it fell off the road. They are eyes! Bravo the Red Army officer Briczkina. And there were still two tracks on the way, German shoe what their paratroopers wear. Judging by the tracks, I want to circle around the marshes. And let's go. Because we'll take these swamps to pass. Now you can smoke from 15 minutes. Who needs it can improve. Quietly! And don't diverge! Yes. The route is dangerous. The order of movement will be as follows: I am first, followed by Gurwicz, Briczkin, Komilków, Czetwiertak. Junior sergeant Osjanin closes up. Are there any questions? Deep there? Sometimes it happens ... To you ... Waist, I mean ... Watch out for rifles. Mud gas comes out. We moved it ... People like that incredible things tell ... they are fairy tales, of course Are the leeches here? There is nothing here. Dead place ... And above him we ... Comrade Sergeant, my shoe will fall off my leg! Damn it... Found? No. We must iЬц. How without shoes? How do you find him now? Come on! Go ahead, follow me. Don't stay. Stay on the path, don't move! - Help her! Stop it! There is no going back! Easy easy! Not much left to the island. We will rest there. Drive. Further it will be easier. We'll get to the dry birch and take it easy. How will I be without the shoe? we made up something. But already beyond the swamp. Will you hold out? It's cold, girls. I'm all wet. Do you think I'm dry? I have a drink once and for all ... Well, comrades soldiers ... We take paths and follow me, in the same order. Leave them here. A little more, comrade Red Army, make an effort. A little further, we will rest at the waterfall. Well, comrade Red Army, everything okay? Everything is all right, Comrade Sergeant. Are you not frozen? There is no one to warm us to anyway. And how? It's good? Even a lot. Thank youъ Comrade Sergeant. Come on, comrade soldiers. We still have an hour and a half to get there. How quiet it is! As in Ьnie. From the left Sinjuchina │╣ka begins. On the other hand, another lake It goes hand in hand with this. His name is Leguntowo. There used to be a monk here. His name was Legun. What elusive are you looking for here ... It's full of ... Germany has only one way between lakes, through │╣ki. We'll wait for them here. Before we can come, we need to find the positions. Main and spare - as prescribed by the regulations. We will choose and we will wait. Obey a combat order. A row of up to two armed with Fryc's teeth moves in the Lake Wope region in order reaching the Kirov railway line and the Bia│omorsko-Baltic canal, name of comrade Stalin. Our branch, in the amount of 6 people, ordered to defend │╣kъ Sinjuchin, where we are to take the enemy captive. Neighbor on the left - Lake Wope, neighbor on the right - Lake Leguntowo. Questions? Please go to position. Maybe we are sitting for nothing? I doubt ... That's what I mean - if those Frycw not confused with tree stumps. You can sleep, comrade sergeant. Wake you up at dawn. Come on with this sleeping, Osjanina. We will have eternal sleep if Frycєw we sleep. Well, maybe they're sleeping now? Fedot Yevgraficz? Мpi╣ ... Cє┐, Yes. These are people too. You said yourselves that │╣ka Sinjuchina this is the only possible transition to the railroad. There is no other ... Wait Osjanin ... Hold on. We walked from fifty kilometers ... But in an unknown place every bush is terrible. Are you thinking right? Yes, Comrade Sergeant. And if so, it might be safe resting somewhere right now. And I'll fall until the sun. Shall we smoke, Comrade Rita? Don't smoke. Yes ... It's like ... The fact that these are also like people ... I didn't understand that a bit. Okay you said - I need to rest. You, too, rest. Go look at the items. How's it going, Briczkina Didn't you notice anything? quiet for now. Watch everything. Do the bushes move, do the birds fear anything? You are a man From the woods, you understand everything. I understand. What, Jelizaweta, did you work in the camp? No. Mostly I was helping my father. He is a forester, we lived in the forest. At least you quiver well. Lisa, Lisa, Lisawieta, why don't you like me Why don't you sing to me - not suitable for you? " There is a chant in our pages. And here they sang ... Later we will sing, Jelizawiec. We'll follow our orders, then we'll sing. Do you promise? I did say. Be careful, comrade sergeant. You promised me. Born in difficult years We don't remember our way. We - children of Russia's terrible years We cannot forget anything. Fingers for the ashes of summer! Is there hope in you? From the days of war, from the days of freedom ... " Who are you reading to?

The birds screamed. Magpies. The magpies are awake, Rita. Someone disturbed them. Looks like we have guests. GoЯ, Osjanina, housing the soldiers. Quick but easy. lest they get scared. And he translates to me! Good morning, Comrade Sergeant Hi. How's Czetwiertak? Мpi. We decided not to wake her up. Correct decision. I will be in range of your voice. But don't show yourself.

Life depends on it, do you understand? Comrade Sergeant, Comrade Sergeant ... What about you? Smile, Briczkina. It is even better that it is theirs sixteen, not two. We would look for two in the forest, oh yes they are here! Way back Do you remember well? Yes, Comrade Sergeant. Listen, the Germans have left the pine forest. You'll go there, and then along the lake. where we have cut the bars. Cheek girl. From there you will go to the stream. Won't you get lost? No, comrade Sergeant. No. So fast, Yelisawto. The swamp is the most important. The road is narrow. Step left, right, there will be a problem. Landmark - birch. Then two pines, that are on the island. Rest a bit there, don't go right away. Yes: weapons, backpack, bags - everything leave here. You'll come faster. Report the situation to Kerijanov. We'll take some Germans, but we can do it too long, you know ... So ... Now I have iЬц? Yes... Don't forget to tense in front of the swamps. So run ... PъdЯ, Jelizawieta. Ple is, girls. Пle ... There are sixteen of them, and sixteen machines are power. You will not stop such a force in front of you, We can't forgive either ... And I'll be here in an hour or two I think so ... How are you feeling I'm fine. I slept well. I sent Briczkina to the quarters. We can count on support before the night. Not before. If we start fighting them, we won't make it through the night. We will not stop at any positions. So what? Are we supposed to watch you go by? We can't let them pass straight on through │╣kъ. You have to beat them off the course. Let it come in a circle. Directing around the Leguntowo lake. But how? Of course they didn't come here to fight. In this case, please be careful to slip silently ... So they must see us. And that we didn't notice them .... Then maybe I'll go somewhere else and try elsewhere. Another place is around Lake Leguntowo - one day's march. But who should I show them? Mustache? Or yourself? Stop, scout out. And find out there are only five of us. If for an hour, a half we won't come up with anything else ... Comrade Sergeant, what if? came across lumberjacks? What woodcutters? There is a war the forests are empty, you just saw ... now women are cutting forests. Women... It is true... Forest workers work in brigades. Look for them there in that bush. You can't kill everyone one shot. And if you miss one everything will tell who needs ... Cє┐ girls the eagle is mine! Comrade Sergeant, Comrade Sergeant! Here come! Help me. Further... On your seats, girls. Komilkowa, for me! Shout louder. Maybe they escaped? Maybe they escaped ... Or maybe not. They are not green either ... They don't send just anyone for such a job. Wait ... I see ... Recon. Count us on your fingers. Take care of them ... This is probably a stupid idea. But you girls ... maybe even ... ... you will be able to escape. Stєj! Raja, Wiera, go and have a bath. If you don't want to ... It is not! Girls, get bathed! Call Ivan! Hey, Vaniusz, where are you? Goъ! Let's go! - Wait a minute! - And wait for me! Who will work? Goъ, goъ! Where are you Hear that? Who will be working, I ask? Come on over here. Turn off. Ah you ... They called from the area the car is coming soon. Enough, get out. Get out, he said. Enough, I order you to leave. Get out! That's enough. Give me a hand! Go out, go out, play with fire ... Come on, come on, go on, go! Go ... Go ... OK... Now girls ... Now we have no place to go. If Briczkina, of course support will not bring ... Will bring. In that case, let's drink a little ... To her fast legs. And your bright heads. Look... This is the culture of the Germans ... They wanted coffee. Why do you think so? I can smell rum ... So they stopped for breakfast. But are all sixteen? We have to count them, Margarita. Who hasn't gone ... 12 people, two on guard. So they're all here. These two went on scouting. They stood for a long time. Dry the linen. It's about time - we can change our items, Margarita. I have a little look around at the rocks. And you and the girls are going to the spare position. Just quiet. I understand. Wait! I spread the tobacco there to dry, take it away. And my clothes, of course. I will take, Fedota Yevgraficz. Did you bring the pouch? I forgot ... Fiedota Yevgraficz, dear ... I don't ... Okay ... Well there ... The smaller of machork╣ ... At least you didn't forget your backpack? Bring it! I know where it is. - Yep, Soldier Gurwicz! Comrade translator! Private Gurwicz shouted. Komilkow for me. Remain here to wait! Germany... Not good... Not good. That's why she screamed. Hit inaccurately, must have been tall. He missed the heart the first time. Her breast interrupted. Pole┐ here, Sonieczko ... Get some rest. They're here somewhere. Here they are. Stay here and when I pass by occupy them with something. Stone, ga│ъzi╣ - as long as they don't see you. I'll take care of them. Understand? I understand. Zuch, Komilkowa. I am thankful to you. Now ... Two already ... less left. Leave me alone ... You have to get used to it, drink ... To lose your soul. Here and the grown men suffer seriously. And understand one thing ... These aren't people. Not men, not even animals ... They are fascists! And draw the appropriate conclusions. You will find our Sam? Find. Go. Go to Sonia. Don't wait long there, later we will cry ... Only no hysteria. She was an exemplary student ... Perfect in everything. Both at school and at the university ... Most importantly, there are no children that would be sad ... Neither my own nor someone else's ... Now they won't be ... A chain of generations ... They cut it. We will mark on the map. And after the war, we will erect a monument! what is this? Boots. I will not. Why are you doing this? because we have a barefoot soldier. - Don't! These are not good things, girls ... In war, there is only one rule - you have to think only of the living. - Assume, order! You can't ... My mother is a medical worker ... Stop lying. You don't have a mother. And never did. I read your papers. You're an orphan - Don't be confused. Why are you doing this? Why? Don't be malicious. Otherwise, we will become bitter. We will be as mean as the Germans! They hurt? That `s nothing. Scratch. Thank you, younger sergeant. For what? In the second you gave me to change the magazine. From that moment to the grave cover we will ride five together. Comrade Sergeant, are you a communist? Yes, what? Please become president our Komsomo meeting. What meeting? For what? Cowardice. Begging... That's good. It's great... Begging... So let's not delay. We will judge companion. We'll make a protocol ... Yes? And then Germany, our protocol approved their resolution. Therefore, as a sergeant and as a communist ... I cancel all meetings at this time. Is it clear? As for cowardice - it wasn't him. Cowardice only in the second fight going out, girls. And this is a mistake, a lack of experience ... Right, Soldier Czetwiertak? That's right ... So I order you to wipe your nose and tears. But using ours stop, girls ... Germany will not wait. I can escape to the forest, look for them there ... And that means we have to get on their tail ... To recognize the situation. War is not only about who will shoot whom, but who will outsmart whom. Wait here. Shot in the back by his own. They finished off the wounded. You see, they have such a right. Let's count ... We took care of two there, Gala. Two here. Should stay 12. And it's not scary for us anymore it's a trifle. Comrade Sergeant! - Fedot Yevgraficz! - Comrade Sergeant! What are you girls ... Easy easy... sucks your sister sisters ... Five heroines like brothers. Tell Fiedot ... And Gala? Our comrades have fallen ... Death of the brave ... Quadruple in a shootout. Lisa Briczkina drowned in the swamp. So together with Sonia, We've already lost three ... This is what it looks like. For this price, we delayed the whole day enemy from the lake. Day! There is nothing here ... Have you lost something? The igniter has no ... You were unnecessarily removed ... Without a fuse, a grenade is a piece of iron. So we were left without artillery, girls ... it's Nothing, Comrade Sergeant. We'll manage! Hear me, comrades soldiers, my order. Wrєg, armed to the teeth, is heading in our direction. There are no neighbors on the right, on the left also. Therefore I command all soldiers ... And hold the front personally! Hold on to the last drop of blood! Because there is Russia behind our backs ... And this is simply our homeland! There will be no help. We have to come here bh ... Probably the last ... Here come! To the positions! The sun ... Give me the bandages! Bandages to make the blood of the village ... There is no. Cholera... GoЯ ... Rita, it's nothing like that. The shard passed right through. Hey you guys! Run away ... chasing them to the forest ... Reptiles ... Hello... Reptiles! penia ... immediately ... she died? There are no backpacks, no rifles ... They took with them or hid ... But they didn't beat us, you understand ?! I'm still alive I need to be knocked down yet! Hurts? Nothing hurts me. Here it hurts ... There's a wound here, Rita. Yes, my dear... I consecrated you. I sacrificed all five. for what? For ten Fryce? Why so? Everything is clear - There is a war. It is known - war, of course ... And then, how will there be peace?
