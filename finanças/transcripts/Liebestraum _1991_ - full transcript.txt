25.000 English SDH RETAiL DVD Subrip PAL ? 21.07.2021 (heavy rain) (thunder) (? upbeat jazz) (woman) Tell me you love me. (man) I love you. (panting and moaning) - No! - (gunshot) (crackling) (gunshot) (gunshot) Ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly be arriving in Elderstown. Passengers for Deerville, Rostok and Nellycamp, transfer at Deerfield. You need a cab, give me a call. (woman) Can I help you? - I've come to see Mrs Anderssen. - Visiting time is not for another hour. - Are you a relative? - Yes. I'm her son. - Which one? - Excuse me? Which one is my mother? That one. I'll be outside if you need me. Please don't disturb any of the other patients. Your mother is a very sick woman, Mr Anderssen. Kaminsky. My name is Kaminsky. - My mother and I have different names. - Of course. I'd like a private room for her. Mr Kaminsky, your mother has only the basic insurance. She's over her credit limit. Just give her a private room, OK? - I'll take care of everything. - All right. Does my mother know anyone in Elderstown? - Does she have any friends? - Not that I know of. Why was she moved here? She was in a very small hospital 200 miles from here. Here at Ralston Memorial we can offer the latest in medical care. How long? We're doing everything we can. How long? I'd say a week... more or less. (bell tolls) Cast iron. Thanks very much. I'm sorry for waking you. What's the matter? You lost your key? You got a front door key! It ain't necessary to wake me. I got enough problems without you disco mothers waking me up. - Hey, I'm sorry. - Yeah. I'll send you the Nobel prize. Where's Buddy? Hey, Buddy! Is this some of Joe's fucking work? Why is this stuff all over the road? - This is the equipment for the scaffolding. - So later it'll be gone? Hello, Paul. Kaminsky. Kaminsky, Kaminsky... Nick fucking Kaminsky! - How are you, man? - What the fuck are you doing here? I thought you were in Chicago. Yeah, I was. But then I got an offer I couldn't refuse, so here I am, in Elderstown. And what about you? Jesus Christ! The last thing you were teaching some architectural, postdoctoral, pre-sexual type thing in upstate New York, right? - I am. - You aren't here to check this out? Check what out? I'm here to see my mother in hospital. - (horn beeps) - I'm sorry to hear that. Hey. I read your books. I didn't read them exactly, but I bought them. My wife read them. She really enjoyed them, she said. But then, you can never believe a woman. - (Paul) What do you think of this? - (Nick) It's beautiful. How long will it take? Four days, a week at the most. I got a great crew. - A week? To do what? - Demolish it. Excuse me. This idiot wants his cheque this afternoon. I told him to see you. Who are we gonna talk to? Let me handle this. I'll see him about two o'clock. What the fuck is he doing here? Oh, man! - I owe you one. - Lucky I looked up. - No, I owe you one. - Don't worry about it. - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing, but you don't have to... No, I'm giving a party tonight. It's my wife's birthday. You gotta come. These are beautiful, Mr Kaminsky. There's the call button. Just press it if you need anything. Would you like to see the menu? I'm not hungry. Are you OK? I'm fine. Going to a party. Mind if I ask you a personal question? I feel like I know you. You in TV or what? What? (? pop) (woman laughs) See you, Mrs Kessler. Hello. - Hello. - You're Paul's wife? Yes, I am. What's your name? Jane. Happy birthday, Jane. I recognise you. From that photograph in your book. Yeah. - You're Nick. - Yeah. Where's Paul? He's around. These are for you. That's very kind of you. They're looking a little sad. I hope it's not too late. I don't think so. I can fix sad roses. (man's voice) Nick! Nick Kaminsky has arrived. Great! Great! It's gonna be a good party. - You met my wife. - Yes. Great. Are you all right? With what I paid for this, you can get two rooms in Chicago. Maybe you get a bathroom in New York. Hi. (Nick) Could I ask you a favour? A favour? You saved my life. Anything. Name it. What? - That building you're gonna pull down. - The Ralston building. I'd like to get a closer look. Maybe write something while I'm in town. You aren't going to say I'm destroying the cultural heritage of Elderstown? (laughs) No. Paul, it's just it's a beautiful building and I'd like to write something. You aren't going to inflict any guilt for this? Promise. We're going in tomorrow at eight o'clock. - You're welcome to join us. - Thanks. Why was it closed down? - Young man! We meet again! - How are you? I didn't realise you knew our distinguished host. Paul and I went to college together. Ten years ago. And then this fucker shows up on Main Street. Quite a coincidence. May I introduce my wife? - Mary. Mr... - Kaminsky. Mr Kaminsky's mother is in our care at the hospital. Good luck. She's joking. You're in the same profession as your husband? It's kind of connected. I work at the hospital. (Nick laughs) Are you a doctor? Mary works in the pathology department, down in the morgue. - It's a fascinating world. - It has its moments. Paul, are you going to dance with me? I got a little hosting I got to catch up on. - But Nick used to be quite the dancer. - No, no. (doctor) You'd be doing me a big favour. You're a really good dancer. I'm an even better fuck. (music drowns out speech) Pete, please. - You all right? - I'm fine. How are you? Are you having fun? - Yeah, I'm having a great time. - Yeah. Stupid fucking bastard! What the hell are you doing in my room? I was looking at the photographs. I didn't mean to frighten you. Excuse me. Ralston building, right? Yeah. It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Cast iron. Gotta get back down. I'm really very, very sorry. It's OK. Good night. Good night. Say good night to Jane. I couldn't find her. I don't know where she went, but... Thanks for the present. Mary. Good night. - Quite a party. - Yeah. Kind of wild, huh? Yeah. Better get some sleep. Can I phone for a cab? No. Absolutely not necessary. Pete, can you give Nick a ride back into town? Yeah. - You ready to go? - Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again. It was great. - Thank you for saving my life. - Fuck you! - See you tomorrow? - Yeah. - Eight o'clock? - I'll be there. Sleep well. Nice party, uh? Get in. It's unlocked. I love a good piss. Boy, you can't beat that! - You a friend of Kessler's? - I went to college with Paul. It's the first time I met his wife. She's a hot little bitch, huh? If I was Kessler, I'd keep her under lock and key. They... seem like a happy couple to me. "They seem like a happy couple to me." I like that. You better slow down here. You like pussy? - You like it or not? - I like it! - You like it? - Yeah. You like it? I love it! (Pete laughs) (Pete laughing) (plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata") (Pete) Here come the police! Hello, Mr Ricker. The usual? - What would your friend like? - He'll have the same. His name is Nick. - Where's Maxine? - Out on a date. - Betty's here. - She'll do just fine. (woman) Betty. Room nine. They're all clean. I have them checked out once a month. Take your pick, Nick. It's on me. Don't do that! You'll bruise my butt. (Pete laughing) Come sit with us, Nicky. Annie! You are depressing the fuck out of everybody! Take it easy, Cindy. Anything you'd like to do, Nicky? Michelle, stand up. Let Nick see you. Michelle's reputation is built around her mouth. It's big. It's perfect. Sit down, Michelle. Barbara, come here. No. Get up. - What are you, Barbara? - I'm a bad girl, ma'am. She can be so unpleasant. But, Nicky... you don't have to put up with any nonsense from this whore. Put her across your knee. She has fine qualities as well. Do you like to eat? Yes. Let him try some, Barbara. Try some. Come on, Nicky. Try some. Nick! Remember, only you can prevent forest fires. (Pete laughs) (siren wails) (? jazz arrangement of "Liebestraum") Hey, Nick. All right. Just in time. A few more minutes... showtime. - Morning. - Morning. So what's so special about this building? It's cast iron. A building like this, it's the missing link in American architecture. What do you mean? Before the cast-iron building came along, a structure's height was governed by the thickness of its outer walls. The higher the building, the thicker the walls had to be. Eight floors is the highest you could go. Let me show you something. The whole of this front is in sections, just bolted together and fixed onto the building. But all this metal, it's very heavy and it has to be supported. So someone came up with the bright idea of a metal frame for the entire building instead of the traditional bricks and mortar. See, with a steel frame, all the stress is shifted to the horizontal. So the support comes from the centre. You can build as high as you like. Hence the skyscraper. You know all this, don't you? Yeah. I read your book. Just wondered if you were as passionate about it as you seem. Yes. I'm passionate about it. Good. Must be nice to be one of your students. Jesus Christ! Holy fuck! (coughs) Jesus! I don't believe it. (Jane) I do. (Paul) Man! - This is fantastic. - Yeah. Amazing, huh? - Did you know all this stuff was here? - No, I didn't have any idea. - Buddy! - Yeah. Look at this fucking mess! What are we gonna do? It won't be a problem. I'll bring some dealers in and... Yeah. - Jane. Where are you going? - I'll be right over here. - Nick. Careful. - We can haul everything out in two days. Let's move it fast. I don't want any publicity, any attention. (Buddy) Guys, bring cable. We're gonna light this sucker up! Paul. That's a cast-iron building out there. It's fucking crazy to knock it down. What do these townspeople think? They don't give a shit. They hate the fucking place. It's a bad memory for them. They'll probably give me a medal. If they don't, the Glendale Development Corporation will. The fucking place is coming down! - No more crap! - (pager beeps) Everything is done. We have dates. We have contracts. In six months' time, there's going to be a fucking busy shopping mall here, the Ralston Center! One more thing, Nick. Remember... You promised me last night you would not fuck it all up with this article, right? I'm not the bad guy here. I'm sorry. I can't get the permit take it down unless you give me the sheet... - You're gonna write about the building? - Yeah, I'd like to. I've never seen anything like that. I know. - How about you? - What? Are you gonna photograph that? You bet. - Thanks. - Sure. Coffee? No, thanks. I'm sorry. It's all right. What's up? The architect's fucked up again. I gotta go to Chicago tomorrow. For how long? A day. Maybe two. - I should get to the hospital. - Nick, I was thinking. Are you gonna need any photographs for that article? Because Jane's work is pretty good. (croaks) - (groans) - Nurse! Nick. Is your mother OK? (sobs) You all right? It's OK. Here we go, gentlemen. If you can do it faster, that's good. There's a lot of... Hey, Jane. One more? Yeah, one more. Then I gotta go home. I gotta pack. - Miss, two more beers, please. - No. Two Scotches, no ice. Jane used to have really long hair. It was beautiful. She could sit on it. And then she cut it all off. She found a pair of black lace panties in the back of my pick-up. Diane. Just one for the road. And then I gotta go home. I gotta pack. - Did I say that already? - No. I have said that already, you fuck. It's a cast-iron building. You can come and go as you please, you know. Just don't come in Jane. I'm fucking serious, Nick. Paul, come on. Paul. Hey, I gotta have one. One more and then I gotta pack. I already said that once, didn't I? - Mr Kaminsky, good evening. - Good evening. - 507? - Yes, please. Thanks. - (Nick) Give it back to me. - Give it back to me. (echo) Give it back. - (Nick) Give it to me, please. - Give it to me, please. - (Nick) Give it to me. - Give it to me. - Give me it or I'll tell my mom and dad. - They're not your mom and dad. Your mother's a crazy woman. (panting and moaning) (ecstatic moaning) Morning. Good morning. You're early. I wanted to get my equipment set up. I was a little nervous. There's a coffee there for you. Thanks. You look a little better than Paul did this morning. This is a hard-drinking town. I don't know how long I'd survive. What are you nervous about? We haven't talked or anything. I don't know what you want. (camera clicks) My father was a photographer. I knew how to use a camera when I was small. I used to help him print. I gave it all up when I went to college. What made you start again? Paul. Right here. A truck, huh? - What did you expect? - I don't know. A Volvo? (Jane) This must be really hard for you. I know how it feels. I was adopted too. I never met my real parents. Must be strange. (Nick) Yeah, it is. My father was killed in a car accident just before I was born and my mother went kind of crazy for a while. So is that why you don't drive? - Because of your father? - Kind of. Just like being driven around by beautiful women. Thanks for the ride. She's been in a lot of pain today. I've just given her some morphine. It'll make her sleepy, I'm afraid. (television mute) Hello, Mother. Jesus. I think you're even prettier than that son of a bitch was. - Do you have a cigarette? - No, I don't. You don't smoke. Sometimes. He smoked two packs a day. They won't let me smoke here, though. They say it's bad for my health. Bring me a pack next time you come. That's better. Sometimes the pain is like a knife. - It's my punishment, you know. - No. Stop that. You mustn't say that. Nick. I asked them to contact you. I know this must be very upsetting. - I'm sorry. - No. Don't be. I'm glad you did. - Really? - Yeah. Really. How did you find me? A couple of years ago I was at a bookstore and I saw your picture. I got a real shock. I knew it was you before I saw the name. I've got all your books in the drawer over there. - Are you writing another? - Yeah. And I'm gonna dedicate it to you. I'd be so proud. He was so handsome. One night he came in very late. I was carrying you. I was still awake. He tiptoed in real quiet so as not to disturb me. So I didn't let on. He slipped into bed and was asleep in minutes. His hand was there on the pillow between us. I gently took it... and I began to kiss the fingers, one by one. And I could smell the cunt on them. (inaudible) - What are you gonna do now? - Go home. - Develop the film. - Will you have a drink with me? I don't think that's such a good idea. Why? We both know why. I should go home. Take a shower. Use mine. Is that your mother? Yeah. She was very beautiful. Yeah, she was. Who's the man? I don't know. My father, I guess. (phone rings) Hello? Hey, Paul! She left about... 20 minutes ago. She said she had to pick up some dry-cleaning or something. She should be on her way home. Bye. Shit. Jane? Yeah? I left something in the building. I'll see you down there, OK? OK. I'll meet you there. Shit! Fuck! There. That should make you feel better, Mrs Anderssen. Stay with me a while. Please. What's the matter? I'm frightened. I thought this might interest you. It was built by the same architect who designed the store. (Nick) I like the store better. Who lives there now? The last surviving Ralston. Barnett Ralston the... fourth. That's him. (Nick) What happened to the rest of the family? (Jane) You don't know? About the murders? That's why the store was closed down. His mother was having an affair with an employee. They used to meet at the store very late at night. And his father found out. And he caught them one night. And he shot them. And then he killed himself. The next day, when the police found the bodies, they discovered that she was still alive. She had been shot in the head. She was braindead but still alive. The Ralston Memorial Hospital was opened the next year. Jane. I won't hurt him. Don't... Don't take... - It's all right. - ..him away from me. No-one's gonna take him away. Shh. (Mrs Anderssen whimpers) (horn beeps) (horn blares) Good night. Good night. - See you tomorrow. - OK. (horn blares) OK! Oh, shit. (woman moaning) (moaning continues) Jesus Christ! You scared the living shit out of me, you fucking cat! (whispering) (whispering continues) (rumbling) You're dead. (water trickling) (bell tolls) Hey. Hey. I'm late. Sorry. That's all right. What happened to you? I fell. - Looks pretty dirty. - Can we get out of here? Hi, Mrs Kessler. Maria. - What are you doing here? - I always come on Thursdays. Right. OK. The guy that was killed in the building... Not Ralston, the other guy. What was his name? His name was Munssen. Don't do that. (knocking) Do you want me to do the bathroom, Mrs Kessler? - What time is it, Nurse? - Your son will be here soon. Here. I brought you a newspaper to read. (Mrs Anderssen) What town are we in? What's the name of this town? Why, surely you know, Mrs Anderssen. We're in Elderstown. No, don't get up. Come on, go back to bed. OK. Sister! (shouting) (struggling) Mrs Anderssen, you mustn't get out of bed. (screaming) Mr Kaminsky, just wait outside. Ralston... Ralston... - If anybody can find this, Mack can. - It's around here someplace. Let's see. Ralston. Yeah. I remember the case well. I was just a rookie at the time. I was the first cop on the scene. A lot of blood. Whole lot of blood. The guy's pecker was still up like a pole. Good-looking broad. What a waste. It took the lab boys forever to get there. I was staring at her and... I noticed this little vein in her neck was still kind of throbbing. Here it is. Hey, Nick. They seem like a real happy couple. Mr Kaminsky. The electricians had a change of plan and they needed to get to the wiring in your room. We've moved all of your things into the adjoining room. It's exactly the same size. You mean the room where the couple was staying? There's nobody else on this floor, Mr Kaminsky. Just you. All week. This way, please. (Jane) Hi, neither Paul nor Jane can answer, but if you leave your name and number, we'll get back to you. Thanks. Hi, it's... Mr Ralston would like to know the name of the newspaper that you work for. No, it's not a newspaper. It's a quarterly magazine on architecture. Here's my card. He'll be down shortly. (? Liszt's "Liebestraum" on piano) (music grows louder) Jane? (sobbing) What's the matter? Help me. Please. (phone rings) No! No! What do you want us to do, Nick? Your mother is slipping away from us. Now, we can keep her alive for quite a long time. It's an expensive process. I'd like you to think about it. May I see her? As soon as she regains consciousness, we'll call you. - Hey. - Hey, how you doing? You about finished around here now? It's gonna be getting dangerous. I'd appreciate it if you'd keep away now. - Paul told me that if I... - I just spoke with Mr Kessler. I have his OK on this. (knock at door) Hello. Hi. I tried to call you. - We have to talk about this. - Yeah. All right. I'll come if you do that. I know that. (phone rings) Don't answer it. All right, Dr Parker. I'll be there as soon as I can. Go on. Mrs Anderssen, your son is here. (man) Shit! Somebody left that door open again. - Wait here. I'll go fix it. - Mm-hm. Ben. Could you come here for a moment? I'm waiting for Jeff. This elevator's stuck. This will only take a moment. - I'm supposed to wait here with her. - Ben. All right. Ma'am. Just give me a sec, OK? All right? (Mrs Anderssen) Forgive me. Ma'am. Ma'am, I think you should wait for the nurse. Ma'am? I can smell her on you. (door closes) I've seen you! I've seen you with your legs spread! Jane, how nice... Jane, is something... Jane, wait! Hello, Mother. (thunder) Hey, Buddy! - How's it going? - We're a little behind. - I wasn't expecting you till later. - I got here early. - Have you seen Jane? - Not since this morning. I'll check back with you. (sighs and whimpers) (thunder) Come in me. Tell me that you love me. Say it. I love you.
