(suspenseful music) (engines humming) (tires skidding) (gun cocking) (car doors thudding) (seagulls squawking) (chains rattling) (water splashing) (water splashing) (zip whizzing) (water splashing) (bubbles popping) - [DJ] Sunshine. Maybe a little cloud in there, but not much. And the rest of the weather story for today, really good. Nice in fact. High expected, 24, 25. That's in the high 70s, not too warm and not too much humidity today. Just really quite nice. Little warmer tomorrow. Maybe a high of 26. Friday, mainly cloudy, chance of showers. But today you'll really enjoy. Right now it's a traffic late edition. And here's Andrew Carner. (radio playing in background) (light switch clicking) (water splattering) (door clicking) (upbeat music) (engine whirring) - How come you're late? - Wally's broke again. We had to stop and steal quarters out of newspaper boxes. - I've been up all night, I had to take him out of the hospital. (car doors thudding) (engine humming) (seagulls squawking) (car doors thudding) - Frank. And what brings you out here? - Just keeping in touch. So, how you keeping, Eddie? - Pretty good. Keeping busy. - How is business? - No complaints. - All right, open it up. - What do you mean, open it up? Since when? - Open it up. - Oh, come on, Prego. No time for this kind of horseshit. We're sitting here with our pants around our ankles. - Hey, come on, make me cry. Dino, up to. - Okay, Dave. (metal clanging) - Ah, yeah. Count it and weigh it. - What? (seagulls squawking) - How's the back? - (chuckles) You learn to live with it. (throat clearing) Has somebody come to see you, Eddie? - Who, one of your people? - You'd tell me somebody came to see you, right? - I'm a broker, Frank, I buy and sell. You know that. I don't mess around in anybody's internal arrangements. Especially yours. (Frank chuckling) - 10-kilo bricks in every bail. - That's a lot of bails. - Yeah. - Frank's not gonna be very happy about being kept waitin'. - We won't keep Frank waitin' much longer. (speaking in foreign language) (engine humming) (engine whirring) - Keep in touch, Eddie. - You bet. - Let's get outta here. - You all right, Mikey? - Yeah, yeah, except for that creep Prego jerking me around. He's asking for trouble. - So? - So what? - So you gonna tell us why the head whop came along riding shotgun? - He hears footsteps. Boys. - No kidding. Who's he gotta be scared of? - His closest friends. - Who, Prego? - Looks like. Check it up. (trunk door thudding) (engine humming) (upbeat music) (engine humming) (car doors banging) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (car door thudding) - I guess the breaks are just about shot, huh? Huh? - Yeah. - What you say, Eddie? - Did you get my flowers, Jimmy? - Oh yeah. Yeah. - How's the hand? (James scoffing) - Oh, I should be able to use it in a couple of weeks. Nice. Very nice. I bet you could buy a few cops for want to pay for this. - Buy all the cops you need for the price of a used Honda, asshole. - So, who's this one registered to? The tooth fairy. - She spoils me, what can I say, ey. (Eddie chuckling) Hey, Jimmy, why don't you leave it alone, man? Why don't you go and chase some Pepsis for your change, ey? - Some of your biker buddies disappeared last night. As I hear it, they went swimming without life jackets. - Really? - Yeah, it's very sloppy, Eddie. It's very, very sloppy. It looks to me like you're gonna get it. - Should be a hell of a wake, ey? - You bet. - You're gonna be there, right? - Yes, sir. I wouldn't miss it for all the coke in Columbia. (distant horn tooting) (engine purring) (tires screeching) - I guess Mikey's gonna have to stomp his other hand. - I got a million dollars in the trunk of this car, and you've got to twist McGrath's tail. - I'm gonna get a beer. - [Waitress] Hi, will you have some breakfast? - [Eddie] Yeah, I'm just going back for a minute. - Listen, I wanna talk to you about Kenny. He's really having a rough time, eh. With the UICs right in and the welfare with the dragon. - Well, sure. Just tell him to come and see me. Wally, come on, let's go. - I'm waitin' on my beer. (door knocking) - Hey, hey. - Where's Mikey? - He's in there. - 22, 24, 26, 28. The rest don't rate. 16. (telephone ringing) - Oh, Harold called. He's got a live one. He's gonna set up a meet. - Hmm-uh. - Eddie, it's Hogan at the docks. Says a shipment of M16s just came in to shed 26. - Oh, good. Tell him to take his break at nine sharp and sends some eggs down there and pick 'em up. Look. - Get a hold of Ray? - Yeah. See if Belfast needs some rifles. Mikey. - Guess what? - What? - My grasps back. - He's tough, I'll give him that. - Yeah, well the next time you lose your temper with this guy, try not to hit him so hard, okay? - He put up a good fight. - The guy was a pain in the asked before. You think you made it better? Call, Garou, tell him I'm on my way. - What's up? - Garou's been cleaning house. Come on, Wally, let's go. - Give me a break, I've been up all night. - Come on. (upbeat music) (car door thudding) Half an hour. - Yeah, sure. (car door thudding) (trees rustling) (birds singing) (engine purring) (wind whistling) (Eddie grunting) (Eddie groaning) (Eddie sighing) (hands tapping) (Eddie grunting) (engine humming) (car horn tooting) (car door thudding) - Guys in Miami are all buying banks, we're still feeding money to the freaking chipmunks. But Jesus, Eddie, we're too big for this shit. We're gonna rot before we can spend it. Are you listenin' to me? - No. (anxious music) (motorbikes roaring) (birds singing) - Mikey, Lulu. (dog barking) (speaking in foreign language) (dog barking) - Where is everybody? Take 'em all for a swim? - Word travels fast, ey? - Sure does. So, who? - The North Chapter. - All of them? - They put your last shipment up the wrong noses. Not when I made it true to my customers. - That was five kilos. That's a quarter-million bucks. - This is not good for business, Garou. - Had to be done. But it leaves me with a problem, Eddie. I have to buy two shipments. The regular, plus one to replace. - That's no problem. - But I only have the money to pay for one shipment. - Ah-ha. (both chuckling) - I was hoping you'd understand. - Oh I do, I do. And I hope you understand this is a cash business. - I have cash. For one. - Okay. Then I'll sell you one. (anxious music) There's nothing personal, Garou. Just call me when you get the necessary. - There are other suppliers. - None of them take plastic, ey. And none of 'em will touch you as long as you owe me. So you better get the boys back to work. If you've got any left. (Wally chuckling) (car doors thudding) (engine whirring) (children playing) (engine humming) - Hi, Dad. - Hey, Danny. (Eddie groaning) How are you? What's the score on this game, huh? - Three, three. - Well, get back in there. Break this tie, gimme a stick. Get up. All right, where's that puck? There comes Griffin outta retirement. He's coming in on a roll. He's got a breakaway. He shoots and he scores. And the game is over. And he's won the Stanley Cup. - He's home. - Well, I'm off. So how long's he been gone this time? I don't know how you put up with it. - Bye-bye. (door clicking) - Hi, Janie. - It's Cheryl. - Yeah, yeah, I know, it's Cheryl. - Goodbye, Bill. - Bye, Janie. (door clicking) (Eddie chuckling) - Staying for supper? - No I'm taking you and Danny out. - Would you stay still for one minute? You've been gone for five days. - Five days, really? Then I'd better have a shower. (lips smacking) - The man they call the godfather of the Canadian underworld... - Here it is. - Today. Andy Little has this report. - [Andy] Mourners came from across the United States, Canada, and even Sicily to pay their last respects to Frank Vitello. - Poor Frank. - [Andy] The Quebec inquiry into organized crime identify Vitello as the leading mafia figure in Canada. - I hear it was one bullet in the brain. - Yeah? I wonder if they kissed him on the forehead before they popped him. - They really take that ceremonial shit seriously, don't they? - Oh, yeah. - Are you kidding? Count the wreaths. - Hey, look, there's ours. - Where? - The big yellow one. - All right. (men cheering) (men applauding) It's pretty. How much that cost us? - 562.43. - No shit. - Hey, you know, Bucheli told me? Frank had lost the mantle of respect. - Probably thought it was bulletproof. (men laughing) - What does that leave us, Brako? - That scumbag. - I don't know, maybe Scalia. He's young, but New York likes him. - There are a couple of dark horses you can't rule out either. - Like? - Bucheli. - Nah, it's Prego. - Let's keep our ears to the ground. - Yeah, we don't wanna get caught on the wrong side, eh. - Right. - Right, Wally. - Right, Wally. (men laughing) (upbeat music) (patrons chattering) - Mr. Griffin. Mr. Prego would like to have lunch with you tomorrow. - Well, why would Mr. Prego wanna do that? - I just deliver messages, Mr. Griffin. Carlos, 12:30. - Carlos, 12:30. - Okay. - Harold. - It's good to see you, Eddie. - You too. - That's him. - Over there? - He wants to take a plunge, just needs a little push. - How you? Two beers. - Relax, Peter. You know there are some conversations Harold doesn't wanna hear. Was it Vanderkeest or Vanderkeist? - Vanderkeist, whatever. - A refill? - No, no. - Are you comfortable here? You wanna talk to somewhere else? - No, this is fine. - Okay (chuckles). So you're interested in making some money? - Yeah, well sure. Who isn't? There's something I don't know. - What would you like to know? - How does it work? - Simple. You invest 200. We use your warehouse for one night. I do the buying and selling. Share the profits. - Yeah? Well, how much do you think? - [Eddie] About three times your investment? - Really? That much? - Overnight. (Eddie chuckling) - Well, happens if something... - What? - Well, if something goes wrong? - Forget it. - No, wait a minute, wait a minute. Sit down, sit down. When? - You in? - Yeah. - Harold will be in touch. - Let's get drunk, beat somebody. - You are drunk. - That's right, I am. And you're somebody. - Hmm-uh. I'll take the car. - Yeah, sure. (keys jingling) I'll see you tomorrow. - Yep. (distant car horns tooting) Hey, Wally. Why don't you just go home? - I can't. I've still got the creeps. You know what it's like. - You've been out almost a year now, man. It's time to loosen up. - It's no big deal, Eddie. Just got a lot of catching up to do. - Yeah. Take it easy, Wally. - See ya. - Ash. Acid. Ash. Hi. - Hey, Bobby. Let's go for a walk. - [Bobby] Okay, McGrath, take it easy. (handcuff clicking) - You doing business? - Yeah, yeah. - What you got? - The Iranian, he's holding half a key. - And? - Well, if you want, I can set up a buyer and you can bust him. Well, you come in the front door and I go out the back door with whatever I can grab. (keys jingling) - Where is your cousin? Haven't seen him in a while. - He's around. He's working, he's working on some scam Wally Degan dreamed up. - Wally or Eddie? - Shit, I dunno. All I know is that it's heavy, alright? He won't tell me dick about it. (handcuff clicking) (upbeat music) (police radio chatter) - [TV Presenter] Now, June, if you'll please turn around and face the crowd. (keys jingling) Behind one of these walls... - Turn it down, Mom. Jesus. - [TV Presenter] All you have to do... (upbeat music) (police radio chatter) (engine purring) (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) (patrons quietly chattering) (Eddie sighing) - How's Giselle? - Oh, she's nuts. She's gone crazy for dancing. Every weekend, it's mambo, tango, cha-cha-cha. And now she signed me up without her memories. - Listen, Tony, what's the score with McGrath, he dropped by the other day. Made a lot of noise. - Ah, he's crazy too. He's the only English cop at the station, you know. They don't know what to do with him downtown. But I wouldn't lose any sleep over him, you know. Ah, he don't get no budget anyway. - Well, if he don't back off, he's gonna smacked. - Don't tell me, tell him. What's the matter with you two guys anyway? When I'm with McGrath, all I hear is Griffin this and Griffin that. And when I talk to you, I gotta listen to McGrath this and McGrath that. Why don't you guys get married and fight it out? - Just try to get it through his head that next time no amount of sick leave's gonna make him feel better. - No, I don't wanna hear nothin' about it. Hey, you're not gonna eat up all them chips there? (Eddie chuckling) (upbeat music) (birds singing) (engine humming) - Wally, Wally. You're such a dirtball. (spade thudding) (door creaking) (gentle classical music) - Mr. Prego's expecting me. (patrons quietly chattering) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Oh. - Thanks. - Well, you want somethin', it's so good, I couldn't wait. - What is that? - Er, it's cannoli cacciatora. You have some, it's good. - I already ate. You can have it. - I'd hoped to have this meeting with you earlier, Eddie, but I've been so busy with the arrangements for Frank. - Yeah, I can imagine. - Yeah, it was a community decision, you know. (speaking in foreign language) The man was dishonest. He stole wedding presents. - Frank? (speaking in foreign language) - Lovely young ladies, Italian ladies, they were inside the church taking their holy vows, Frank nephews the back of the house stealing the wedding presents. - Of course, you know nothing about this? - I will be taking delivery of the next shipment. - I had a deal with Frank. I don't have a deal with you. - Yeah well, now's the time we make new deals. - Oh, cousins from New York gave their blessing, did they? - It's a formality. - Hmm. Okay. Make me an offer I can't refuse, Sal. - Sure, I can know that for you. (glasses tinkling) You deal with me from now on. Exclusively. And you drop your prices by 20%. (Eddie chuckling) - You know, if you wanna screw somebody, Sal, it's nice to kiss 'em first. No? Makes 'em feel wanted. - I mean it. - I got some other offers I wanna consider. - It's a very serious offer, Eddie. - I know that. Do you? - Yeah. Geez, that's too bad. I'd love to, but I'm not a bank. No. No, it can't be done. (door clicking) Look, you get the money to me by lunchtime or kiss your knee caps goodbye. (door thudding) (Wally laughing) Oh, by the way, say hi to Betty and the kids for me. (telephone receiver clicking) - I love it when you felt dirty. (men chuckling) - So what do you say? We take Prego seriously or not? - Ah, he's all mouth. - I don't know, he's pushing hard downtown. He's trying to put a lock on everything. - Think he can make it stick? - Who knows? It looks like the muscle's moving over to Scalia. - I thought so. New York? - They like him. But Bucheli's got good connections in the old country. - So Prego's a distant third and fading fast. - So you putting your money on Scalia? - I'll put it on the first guy to cross the finish line. - Oh geez, this is too complicated. I liked it better when we were knocking off Brigg's trucks. (Eddie laughing) - Which got you nine years. - So call me old fashioned. - Come on, Old Fashioned, I'll buy you your beer. (Eddie chuckling) You guys too, come on. You can tell us about the good old days, Wally. When men were men, hey, Mikey. (Mikey growling) (Eddie laughing) When the tellers kept more than a hundred bucks in their drawers. - [Wally] Hey, come on, you guys. (Eddie laughing) - Here you go. Be careful, there are eggs. - Okay. - Here. You got it? - Yep. - Thank you. (children playing) (car horn tooting) (engine humming) Hi. - Hi, Dad. (car door thudding) - Hi. Hey, Danny, you wanna go to the hockey game? - Yeah. - Aw, Eddie, he's got homework. - He's not flunking, is he? - No. - All right then, one night won't hurt won't hurt him. - It's not one night. It's every night you come home. - [Danny] We in the reds. - Yeah, right behind the bench. - Do up your seatbelt. - Keep your feet off the upholstery. - And try to have him home by 11. - Might be overtime, honey. You never know. (car door thudding) (engine purring) (upbeat music) Got the best seats in the house. Do you how many kids in your class would die for seats like that? - [Danny] The seats are great, the game was boring. - Hmm-uh. - Eight, one. Who do you think's gonna win? - Yeah. - Besides, there's only five minutes left. And besides, I like watching it on TV better. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - At least you get to see the replays and the goals getting scored. - Yeah, that's true. You wanna go for ice cream? - Nah, let's go home. - Okay. - Hey, Dad? - Hmm-uh. - [Danny] There's this scar in my class, Matthew Sing. He's really neat and you know what? - What? - His dad got him this computer that does graphics and prints out designs and things. He even made his own birthday invitations. It was really neat. - I guess you want one for your birthday now, ey? - No, no, I was just telling you because I think it's really interesting. - Yeah. - Oh and you know what else it does? - What? - It answers the phone for you and takes your messages. - Oh, maybe we should get one for mom. - Yeah, she'd really like that. (anxious music) (engines humming) Dad? - Yeah. - What do you call a man who studies bones? - Er, bone man? Skeleton man? - No, it's not a joke. What do you call them? I've seen this TV show about them. - Um, okay, I don't know, I'll bite. - Oh well, it's neat. They got this bug room where the bugs eat all the meat off the bones. - Yeah, right. - [Danny] Can I be one? - Yeah, sure. Get down. (tires screeching) (engine revving) Get down. Get down. (gunfire booming) Down. (glass shattering) (gunfire booming) (tires screeching) - That much, eh? - Worth every penny of it. - Okay. - Visa or MasterCard? - MUC. I was thinking you might like to lend it to me. - I don't understand. - I don't understand a family man who'd deal in kiddy porn. You got a garbage collection tonight? - Yeah. - Be sure to put out yours. I'll bring these back in two days. I will check. (store owner sighing) (door clicking) - Liz? Liz? Pack some clothes. You're going up north for a couple of days. - Where's Danny? - He's in the car. He's okay. (anxious music) Liz? Where you going? - Hey, honey, are you hurt? What happened? What happened? - We were shot at. - Someone shot at Danny? - Just get when the car, Liz. Everything's okay. - What the hell happened? - Come on, just get in there. - Get away from us. Get away. (sorrowful music) (car door thudding) - Look- - Get away from me. - Now, just get in the car. (fists thumping) - Stop it. - Get in the car now. - Stop it. Stop it. - Please. - You promised me. - Stop it. That you would never let 'em. - Stop it. Stop it. (Liz crying) - Hey, hey, hey. You'll be a lot safer if you just go. (Liz sobbing) - I have had it, Eddie. I have had it with this life. - I know. I'll take care of this. I always have. - You fix it, Eddie. Just fix this. - Yeah, I will. I will. (Liz crying) Look after your mother now. Okay? (car door thudding) (engine purring) (pages rustling) - Is Danny okay? - Sure. He's a tough little kid. (newspaper thumping) - Prego. That son of a bitch. I'd like to run him through his past and make him feed him to his kids. - Jesus, and they missed. - Yeah, that was the big mistake. - [Wally] All they had to do is make a decent offer. - Call Nick. Tell him I'm open for offers. - By the way, we're stuck with the M16s. Belfast backed off as soon as they heard. - Shit. - You got a minute? - Hmm? What? - What we gonna do about Prego? Let him squirm? - No. What's the connection again. - He's Glen McCaffrey's kid. It's his first big score. - A thousand cases. I counted. Worth a million, two retail. - Glen McCaffrey's boy, right? Never hang onto the truck. Always dump as soon as you get the trailer stashed. - Oh yeah? I didn't know, it was my first time. - So what did you do? Show up the wiring by remote control? - I dunno. Just drove outta the parking lot. - Jesus. (anxious music) Skinhead over here is trying to screw me. - [Eddie] What you offer him, Mikey? - 100. - 100? Does he make your deals for ya? Okay, I'll give you 75 grand. - Are you outta your skull? - All right. 50. - Who the hell do you think you are? - 25, my last offer. - Up yours. (fist thudding) (foot thumping) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (foot thumping) - Never let somebody else make your deals. - I owe you one. (anxious music) - It wasn't us. We don't miss. - Yeah, that's why I'm here. I brought you a present. - You want me to hit Prego, eh? No. - You get another when he's gone. - Prego didn't leave me high and dry, Eddie. You did. - Take this contract, I'll forget about the money you owe me. - All of it? - All of it. - What happens to all merchandise that Prego used Tremblay. - The quantities involved are a little outta your league. - Not full long, Eddie. So can I count on a steady supply? - Yeah, I'm always open for offers. So are you gonna do Prego or not? - Sure. For you, Eddie, sure. - Is this D? D? Should be D. All right. Gotcha. Gotcha. Smile. ♪ I'm gonna put you in the movies ♪ (anxious music) ♪ I'm gonna make a big star out of you ♪ ♪ I'm gonna put you in the movies ♪ ♪ All I gotta do is act naturally ♪ (McGrath humming) (doorbell buzzing) (television blaring) Wally, how are you? I've got something to show you. Have you got a VCR anywhere? - What the hell are you doing? Get outta here. (door clicking) Go to bed, Ma. - I was sure you'd have one. Now I'm the only person I know who doesn't have one. - Let me see your warrant. Let's see it or get the hell outta here. - Relax. Wally, relax. This isn't what you would call official. Play. On. Sit down. Go on, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. - Look, I got no time for home movies, huh. - Wait, it gets better. You got any more beer? You got some popcorn? Sit down.

All that scraping and sudden. How much do you get for a casket? 1,500? 2,000? Is it really worth it? I think the last touch, I think that's pure Hollywood. Oh maybe no, maybe it is too much. I don't know. Well, what do you think, Wally? - I've done time before. - Time. You think you're gonna do time for this? You're a dead man, Wally, you just buried yourself. - What that? - You saw what they did to the whop for stealing wedding presents. Robbing graves, Wally. Maybe even Irish graves. Jesus. You're dog meat. You're gone. You're down for the count. Eddie's gonna tear you limb from limb. - Eddie and I go back a long time. - Oh yeah? Did ya, did ya? He's buried more than one friend. I'm surprised you haven't found them in your excavations. - Look, what do you want from me? - Wally. You are gonna tell me everything that you think is important and everything that I need to know. You're gonna be telling me stories about Eddie that his mother doesn't know. - I don't know anything. Eddie's the only one who's got all the details. - But you and me, Wally.

They both send their love. - This one fall off the back of the truck too? (all laughing) - [Eddie] You never change, do you? - Neither do you. The first present I ever got from this bugger still had the custom sticker on it. (both laughing) I didn't think anything of it. Two days later, two policemen come and ask me a lot of foolish questions about a break-in at a warehouse. - Mikey did it. (all laughing) - Oh, oh. - Happy birthday. (lips smacking) (hand slapping) (Mickey laughing) (gentle classical music) (patrons quietly chattering) (door clicking) (anxious music) (telephone dinging) (telephone dialing) (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - It's a long-distance call for Mr. Prego. - Can you hold please? - Yes, I'll wait. - There's a phone call for Mr. Prego. (patrons quietly chattering) (patrons laughing) (anxious music) - Thanks. Hello? Hello? Yeah, hello? Hello? (gun silencer whumping) (dramatic music) - Shipment set? - Thursday night. - Hmm-uh. You tell Scalia? - Not yet. Oh, watch out, Wally's going for control. - Oh, yeah? - Wally control? He doesn't have the what's the word? - Finesse. - Brains. - Balls.

(Eddie laughing) Oh. All right. (Eddie laughing) (telephone receiver clicking) (Eddie laughing) Hey, Wally, guess what? - What's up? - Celebratory Prego just made tomorrow's headlines. (Eddie laughing) (hands slapping) (men laughing) - Christ. - What you think, the high tides are gonna come riding in here and bury us all in mozzarella? (men laughing) - Yeah. - Come on, Scalia understands, he's got kids of his own. It's not gonna break his heart to go to Prego's funeral. (Eddie laughing) Just to show him how big my heart is, I'm gonna give him a special deal the next shipment. Yeah. Call Dave. Tell him to get Liz and Danny down tomorrow. - You got it. (Eddie chuckling) Oh-oh. I think Wally's losing control, Mikey. (both laughing) Come on play. - [Eddie] Come on, Wally, loosen up. Come on. - See you tomorrow, Mikey. - Goodnight. - Yeah. (door thudding) Oh, god. (engine humming) - Want a lift? - I'm going with Mikey. Say hi to your mom. - Okay. (car door thudding) (engines purring) (car door clicking) (finger tapping) - Morning, Wally. You seen the paper yet? (Wally groaning) Maybe you think I'm joking, huh? Maybe you think I like paying visits to your place. Or maybe you think that Eddie knocking out the competition just wouldn't interest me. Maybe I didn't have a quarter. (Wally groaning) Give me a call. You stupid little shit. (Wally groaning) Talk to me, Wally. That's a shame. That's a real shame. I'll see ya on TV. - I'll give you something. - You're a screw-up, Wally. I shouldn't have bothered. - There's a shipment. - Oh yes, and Eddie's gonna be on hand to weigh the money personally, huh? - No. No, Mikey. (Wally groaning) (anxious music) (Wally groaning) (Wally panting) (upbeat music) (distant sirens blaring) - Harold says you got a problem? - Now, look, I changed my mind. - Harold's right, you've got a problem. - Yes, it's all off and I want my 200 back. - (chuckles) Peter, you don't back out of a deal like this. - I want no part of it and I want my money back. (Eddie laughing) Look, I'm serious, all right. I want out. - How big is the trunk of your car? - You can't. - Yes, I can. (Eddie laughing) (Eddie laughing) Life on the edge is a bitch, hey, Pete. (Eddie laughing) (upbeat music) - [Detective] How much? - [McGrath] 30, 40 million. - You're telling me you've got a bust that big? And the Drug Squad in Montreal doesn't care? - Well, that kind of money, this guy can afford a very low profile. You figure it out. - What's wrong with the RCMP in Montreal? Why call Ottawa? - Horseman of mortgages too. - That's a very serious allegation. You care to name names. - Look, I'm not here to make allegations. I'm here to give you 30 kilos of cocaine. Now, why don't we just cut the crap and get the job done? (page rustling) Do I get to come along for the ride? - No. (trolley whizzing) (upbeat music) - There's this one here and two more on the trucks. - We'll check this one. Get this box outta here. - I'll pay the driver. Let's get outta here. - Having a gram. (radio squelching) - Is it a go? (radio squelching) - [Detective] We got a bonus, Mikey's handling the product. - Well, do it now then. You guys ready? Let's go. - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. (engines humming) (car doors thudding) (engines purring) - Okay, guys, let's put these boxes on the truck. - Come on, come on. - Police. - Hey, get down. - Get down on the ground. (police yelling) - [Police] Don't move. Put your hands on your head. - Down. - Get down. Get down. - [Police] Get down on the ground. - Take some home to your mother. (hand slapping) (tires screeching) (anxious music) - Hey, come on, I'm just a driver. I'm just a driver, come on. - Hey, hey, don't move. You guys are history if you move. Go around, you're gonna get hurt. - Put your hands on your head. - Calm down, sucker. Move along. - Okay, here we go. (anxious music) - [Police] He's going down the back. Grab him, grab him. (gun booming) (tires screeching) (engine revving) (tense music) (Mikey thudding) (tires screeching) (engine humming) (police radio chatter) (engine humming) (Eddie sighing) (light switch clicking) (light switch clicking) - What's the matter? Come to bed. - I'm tired. - No wonder, it's a quarter to four. - I'm tired of waiting, Eddie. I waited seven years for you to get out of Archambault. And then I waited 10 years for you to build a business. And now I'm waiting for a call that tells me that they've just found your body stuffed in the trunk of some car. - So stop worrying. That's the life. You've known that since you were 17. What do you expect? - A life. - This is a life. - It's a street life. It's for tavern rats. Take the money. Go onto something else. - I don't want to. I like it. - Well, what about us? What about me? What about Danny? - Danny's got the best clothes, the best schools. He's got every freaking toy in the world. What about Danny? - He's the only kid in his class that's been shot at. Well, maybe Danny and I should just go and you can get on with the life. - Don't even think about it, Liz. - Don't talk to me like that. (coin clanging) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - [McGrath] Eddie. - Who's this. - [McGrath] Thought you'd like to know, we busted your shipment and Mikey. (anxious music) (telephone receiver thudding) (telephone jingling) (glass shattering) (car door slamming) - Just make sure I don't kill the son of a bitch. What hell am I paying for, fatso? - Well, yesterday, you almost gave me a heart attack. - Come on. Come on. (patrons quietly chattering) Come on, come on. - Come on, take it easy, man. I didn't know, Eddie, I swear. Nobody knew. - McGrath knew. He called me at home with the good news. On my private line. - But it was Ottawa, Ottawa Mounties. Not even the Montreal guys. No, they didn't ask for no help, no cooperation, nothing. The press is going nuts. - Yeah. (hand slapping) - Maybe I can find out where they're keeping it and you can steal it back. (hands slapping) - I wanna know how they found out. And I wanna know what McGrath had to do with it. If any of my guys goes inside on this thing, you're going in with them. And believe me, it won't do much for your hemorrhoids, asshole. (door slamming) I wanna know who did this. I wanna how the horseman knew. I mean, what the hell was McGrath doing there? And I wanna know which one of them bastards killed Mikey. - [Cliff] Eddie, we did it by the book. - What book were you reading, Cliff? - Had to be the other end, Eddie. - [Jimmy] What about the warehouse guy? We're not the only guys involved in this. - I don't want excuses. Just get off your asses. You call Harold. Tell him to get bail for Dave and get him down here. You get over to Scalia's. He's gonna think we're jerking him around. (door clicking) - Can you replace the stock? - Not 'till the leak is plugged. Jimmy? - Yeah. - Nevermind. Get a suit, get a haircut, get down to Miami. Score, whatever the hell you can now hurry up. (door clicking) I want you to look after Mikey's family. Take care of the arrangements personally. Anything they need, you see they get it. - Sure thing. Maybe it's just a fluke, huh? Law of averages. - I don't believe in the law of averages. - You want me to set up a hit on McGrath? - Are you nuts? - But you can't just let, 'em walk all over- - Where's your brains, Wally? We wait. We wait 'till the goddam heat's died down. When do we get the business straightened out, then we worry about McGrath. Christ. (door thudding) (anxious music) (upbeat music) - I've got 22 employees working for me. How am I supposed to keep track of what they do in their spare time? - Smuggling 30 kilos of cocaine hardly qualifies as extracurricular activity. - I told the RCMP, I told the newspapers, I told the television, and now I'm telling you. I had absolutely nothing to do with that shipment. I'm getting tired of this. Just leave me alone, will ya. Just leave me alone. I'm tired of all this. - Not even for $200,000. - [Vanderkeist] What do you mean by that? - What do you think I mean by that? - I have absolutely no idea. - Really? Isn't that what you paid Eddie Griffin for a piece of the shipment? - Now who the hell's Eddie Griffin? - Really good, Peter. Really good. Now look, you've got a problem. This is the first big shipment he's ever lost and you are gonna be very high on his list of question marks. Especially after I let it be known that you've been very cooperative with the Mounties. Then you get to know who Eddie Griffin is. - Yeah? That's blackmail. - Law enforcement. - Go take care of somebody else, honey. So what's this I hear, you can't get bail for Dave? What's going on? - It's not your biggest problem, Eddie. - What is? - Peter. - Yes, so he wants his money back. So what? - McGrath is all over him. - Jesus. Is he talking? - The man's shaky. - No shit. - I don't think he can be guaranteed, Eddie, not in the condition he's in. - Well, perfect, Harold. That's perfect. (solemn music) (rain splattering) (keys jingling) - [McGrath] Hey, Wally. Wally. - Jesus, what the hell are you doing here? - You're not going out to the cemetery? What's the matter? You seen the casket somewhere before? Hey, keep in touch. (engine purring) (car horn tooting) (anxious music) - The guy's name is Peter Vanderkeist. - Eddie, you're making a lot of enemies. - It's easy. There is no important friends. No fuss. - So why don't you do it yourself? - I either spend my time finding new supplies or chasing this jerk. - And what's in it for me? - A hundred. - And? - 120? - Money isn't the issue, Eddie. - What is? - I want to discuss our relationship. I want to discuss our future. - I'm more concerned with the present. What about Vanderkeist? - I'll have to think about it. - Think fast. - I'll let you know. (door knocking) - And how is my baby? (door clicking) (lips smacking) (Peter groaning) Now that's the first nice thing that's happened to me all week. - What are friends for? (Peter chuckling) (lips smacking) - You want a scotch? - No, I want a triple scotch. A VCR? Well (chuckles). Got any dirty movies? - You didn't bring any? - You didn't tell me you're gonna buy one of these things. - You didn't tell me you were giving me one. - I didn't give you this. - [Solange] Some guy delivered it this afternoon. - [Peter] Some guy? Tall, dark, and handsome guy? (Peter laughing) Are you holding out on me? - [Solange] No. He said it was from Peter Vanderkeist. From you. (anxious music) - [Peter] Me? Well, that's crazy, I had nothing to do with it. (explosion booming) (tires screeching) (engine humming) - At least four people are dead and 17 injured in a spectacular bombing of a downtown apartment in the early hours this morning. Andy Little reports. - [Andy] Montrealers have not seen anything like it since the early days of the FLQ. The bomb exploded at 1:00 AM in an apartment on Lincoln Avenue, around the corner from Station 25. Police and urgent ante were on the scene in minutes but no arrests were made. Among the victims were Peter Vanderkeets, a major- - Vanderkeist. - [Andy] A vegetable wholesaler who was arrested two days ago after a cocaine bust at the central market. 32 year old, Solange De Shotel was also killed in the same apartment. Two other people died, 17 were injured, and countless others were shaken up. Police believe at least 10 pounds of army explosions... - Pay your parking tickets, girls, the cops are gonna be all over us. - [Andy] The results were spectacular. The blast blew apart the 12th and 13th floors of the apartment... - I'll have a club soda. - [Andy] These investigations... - Seeing how Wally's buying. - [Andy] Andy Little, NBC News, Montreal. - Well just don't sit there staring, congratulate me. I've just been made a big shot. - Don't tell me. West End boy makes Chief of Police? Old papers, Wally. (coins jingling) - Yeah, Wal. Tell 'em I've just been given my very own task force. Tell 'em I used to be the station pain in the ass. Until some big-time gangster and his boys blow out two floors of an apartment building right around the corner from the office. If you wanna kill four people. Not for lack of trying, god knows. But now I've got big budget. I've got lots of overtime. I have everything I need to append the perpetrators. - Do you anything about that, Wally? Must've missed it. Terrorists? - Seem to be a couple of Irish names mixed up in it. Now what do you think about that, Ed? Sort of makes the old neighborhood look a little bad. Don't you think? Hmm. What do you think about that, Wally? Huh? Maybe you could dig something up for me? - Bugger off, McGrath. - Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Give me a call sometime, Wal. We'll do lunch. (Wally scuffling) Cracks in the foundation. Starting to show, Ed. - Let me go. (Wally panting) (anxious music) (engine humming) (car door thudding) (door creaking) - It's payday. - I'm not happy with the way you handled it. - Yeah. It's a real problem when you have to hire somebody else to dump your garbage, ey? - I guess I'll have to change contractors. - I had to send a message. You weren't listening. - I'm listening now. What is it you wanna say to me? - I want us to be partners. - Partners? Well, who the hell do you think you are? I don't need you, you need me. I'm the only guy around who deals in the kind of volume you're gonna need if you wanna do big business. So don't piss me off. 120 as agreed. (locks clicking) Careful how you open it. (door creaking) (door thudding) (Garou chuckling) (door clicking) (distant dog barking) (Wally sighing) - Relax. Wally, come here. Something I wanna pass along. 10 days from now my budget, my big bomb blast on the Missonote runs dry. See that's my Eddie Griffin money. That's your deadline, Wally. You got 10 days to deliver. - I gave you the coke. - No, no, no, no. That was just to make up for not telling me about Prego. - I gave you Mikey. - Mikey, I took. You gave me nothing. Now you gotta remember the video is for Eddie. We are back to the original deal. Wally. You give Eddie to me or I give you to Eddie. (anxious music) 10 days. (Wally sighing) (engine humming) - [TV Presenter] Showing a two of spades, a 10 of diamonds and a four of hearts. In order to keep the game alive, wheel number four likes to turn another number? - Wally? Wally? What are you doing, Wally? - [TV Presenter] Kindly, spin the wheel. There she goes. - I'll clean it when I get back. (door slamming) (anxious music) (envelope rustling) (door clicking) (engine humming) (car door thudding) - Company, thank god. - Any word from Jimmy? - Yep. He can get you 20 keys. - Terrific. - Next week. - Oh shit. Nothing else? - Key here, a key there. - Well, it's a start. Where's Wally? - [Cliff] Don't know, haven't seen him. (telephone ringing) - Yeah? (anxious music) 15 minutes. (telephone receiver clicking) (machines buzzing) (machines dinging) - Hey, beat it. I got this off McGrath's desk. (anxious music) I guess he's been squeezing him pretty hard. This is bad, hey. You think I should put in for early retirement? - Shut up. (anxious music) (upbeat music) (engine humming) (speaking in foreign language) (door clicking) - You're a brave man. - I got a thing I want you to help me with. A contract. - If it's not Eddie Griffin, I'm not interested. - It's got nothing to do with Eddie. It's personal. - Who? - McGrath. (Garou chuckling) I got 75,000 in cash and coke here. - You're asking me to kill a cop. - How much do you want? - [Garou] He must really have you by your balls, ey? - Look, maybe I can arrange a shipment for you or something. - How much is Eddie worth, Wally? Huh? He's got friends all over the world. Friends at the airport, friends at the docks. (anxious music) You know where Eddie buries his money, Wally? You know who to call in Colombia? - Forget it. - If you don't kill this cop what's Eddie going to do to you? Huh? But you and Eddie are old friends, aren't you? - Yeah. - [Garou] That doesn't matter to Eddie, why should it matter to you? Sit down. (Wally sighing) Let's talk about it. - First time this place has looked like a motel room in years. - I want everything shut down. - [Cliff] There's things in the works, Eddie. - Everything. - [Cliff] I don't have time to get to them all. - Are you listening to me? Just shut it down. Just shut it all down. Don't do nothing until I tell ya. - You're the boss, Eddie. - Check the drawers in the other room before you go. (telephone thudding) When Wally comes in, tell him to call me at home. (door thudding) (anxious music) (engine humming) (car door thudding) You and Danny are going to Toronto. Check into the King Eddie and wait for me. - [Liz] Now? - Right away. - What happened? (telephone ringing) Hello? It's Wally. - Hey, Wally. Listen, can you pick me up at the motel tonight? Yeah, about 11. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, I'll see you there. - What is going on? - It was Wally. He turned over. - Oh, come on, he couldn't have. - He did. He turned over. He sold me to McGrath (gun clicking) and he killed Mikey. - Oh, Jesus. What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna take care of it. Without Wally, McGrath's got nothing. - [Liz] Eddie, please don't do this. - This won't take long. I'll see you tomorrow. (anxious music) (door clicking) (engine humming) (car door thudding) (door clicking) (Eddie sighing) (engine humming) (car door thumping) - Eddie? Eddie, is that you? (light switch clicking) Eddie, what's happened? (tape clattering) (gun cocking) - Mikey trusted you, Wally. So did I. (shotgun cocking) (shotgun booming) (Eddie thudding) (gun clicking) (gun booming) - Come on. (door clicking) (crickets chirping) (police radio chatter) (anxious music) (tires screeching) (engine humming) (police radio chatter) - Yeah, I wanna report a dead body. The motel, room 18. (telephone receiver clicking) (car door thumping) (engine humming) (upbeat music)
