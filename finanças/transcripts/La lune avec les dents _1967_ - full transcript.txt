Manuela? Are you busy? Can I crash at your place? We met yesterday. It wouldn't work at my place. I'll explain. Are you at home? I'll be there at 2pm. Thanks. See you later. Cameraman Sound & Mix Assistant Cameraman Executive Producer Assistant Director Editor Music Written & Directed by Michel Soutter BODY SHOP " I love 3 Jews... "Soutine, whom I love the least, " Modigliani, " and Chagall whom I love the most. " The green violinist and the lovers floating on the music " of the gentle young musician, now grown old, sitting by the sea. " I think of you when I shave. " I think of you when I lie in bed... " you who posses but a single shirt and I have only one shirt to wear. " I gaze outside dreaming tenderly of your little hut safe from humidity. " You're so kind. What's this? I made coffee. I know you like it. - Apples! - I picked the best. And there is a surprise for you. We'll put them on the balcony. - It's nice here. - Especially the view. I spend hours watching the mountain. It's a human mountain... like a sleeping dog. I'll knit you a winter sweater. - Do you like black? - Yes. I see nothing but! - What's that? - The surprise. Are you coming? Are you happy? What's that? It's your patron saint's day. I'm getting old. Something has to change. I can stay. I don't work until 9pm. Ok? No? I have a rendezvous which may change my life. - I'll wait here. - No, I have to go. And the candles? Blow them out. " The desire to stop living is strange. It never crossed my mind. " You shoot yourself, then I desire to live. " An insane desire as solid as stones upon the sea. " Your eyes are clear blue... like mine. " Swiss Lottery. Try your luck! Buy the winning ticket now! Hopes and dreams come alive at the Saturday night lottery! 100 grams of chestnuts. - How much? - 60. " I'll follow you to the death, dear friend, " further than I imagined. " A day without you is a day without love. " An eternal shadow covers my heart. " " Still in your arms, further than imagined, " I live, I dance, I laugh. " A day without love should be forgotten. " Winter days are short... " Come in. - That's a nice song. - The key is on the table. - Are you busy? - No. - When do you want it back? - Whenever. - I'll be gone 2 months. - And you? Me? - Bye. - Bye. - This is nice. - It's better than the bowling ally. Yes and no. I go there with my dad to relax. - And you? - I'm there all day. - Manpower got me the job. - We can take time off to do other things. - What do you do? - Lots of things. - You have unusual eyes. - I'm nearsighted. I see the moorhens on the lake, that's enough. - Do you know Copi? - The runner? No. He's no fun. A sad snail talks to an old woman. She says: " Life is worth living but " a snail must be brave and bow to no one. " The snail says: " Life is not always nice. " Then she crushes it! - Nice. - Not bad. - Do you live alone? - With my parents. - Do you have dogs? - 2 Irish Setters. My dad is a hunter. He kills. - I know... Really? - Maybe. A hare died in Renoir's film " The Rules of the Game ". It twirled in the air as if it were dancing then stretched its limbs as if to help its own life flow away. That's death! Migrant workers could live on these boats. There are half a million here. There are many hotels but nowhere for foreigners to live. - Do you have Italians? - A cook and a gardener. - What do they do? - Cook and garden! Are you happy or unhappy to see me? - I'm here. - As a caprice. - Women are never serious. - Who? Do you want to come with me to my friend's flat? When we know each other better. I'm unfathomable. A fire! An arsonist? I love fire. And you? Remember the sirens during the war or were you too young? - You were too young. - I was too young. I'm in love with you. - You love me? - I said: " in love ". - Do you like tea? - I like the Chinese. And you? - Strong? - Light. And the Chinese? - I'm not into politics. - I am... we'll get along fine... - What do you do? - Put up flyers. That's what we do in Europe. How can you live with no political opinion? I'm learning things at university. Ideas... Ideas... - Things must change. - I'd love it. - What do you do about it? - And you? Time takes care of everything. I do not accept the world as it is. I hibernate like a groundhog. - And you call that " brave "? - In a way, yes. If you think of how privileged man is, it takes courage to say " no ". And women? They use their weakness to please. Children, virginity and love are all weaknesses. You're taught to be fragile. Men have it easy. Are you fragile? I'm a tough guy. What do you want? - Women who love us in order to really live and not just exist. I've thought about that. - And? - I struggle with myself. We're all struggling. You said you read a lot. - I lent them out. - All? - Yes. - What are you doing? I'm reading Henry Barbusse. - Is he French? - Yes. - French in Moscow, like everyone in the '30s... Gide, etc. - It's beautiful. - Read the page I marked. " Wandering through naked reality, I am an ordinary man. " I identify with those who desire, who cry out... " I spell out the surprising truth: " I desire what I do not have and have lost. Thus we live and die. " - May I have some water? Thirsty? - I'm reading " Tears of Rage ". - Do you want some? - No, just water. - Cognac? - Water. Leave me a drop. What do you do at the bowling ally? I distribute shoes. It's not a great but I get paid. Are you cold? Let me breathe. Remove my coat, please. - You have unusual eyes. - Yeah, I'm nearsighted. - What do you want to see? - Your belly. I'm cold. - Get in bad. - Already? - And music? - There's no radio... just the neighbour... a black pianist. Do you want to listen? Black music turns me on. - Don't you want to? - No. I just can't. Do you understand? All too well. - Are you going? - Just to the window. - May I have a puff? - Are you upset? - You should have told me earlier. We have time... lots of time. - The floor! - Was it true about the musician? - A little. I love you, William. Now I know I do. I wasn't sure before. You frightened me. - Why? - We were so different. - And now? - No. Do you hear the tram? - Are you listening to me? Yes. Continue. " A woman and a man together is an awesome yet beautiful thing. " I want to die for you. " Tell me. Do you love me? - Be like Mrs. Renken. - Who? The woman in the painting. - Leaving? - Yes. No one ever hit me. - I didn't mean to. - Give me my shoes. - Come get them. Did I hurt you? Do you want Mrs. Renken? - Will we meet again? - Why Mrs. Renken? Because she is whole, inside and outside. - Can we see each other? - If you can. - I'm free. - Tomorrow. - When? - Call me. I'm in the phone book. - Will we eat out. - No, at my place. The tram. - I called Breugel. - He has work for you. - That's why I called. - What is it? It's is better than the bowling ally. You'll start as an underwriter. - You'll become something. - You know what I think. You don't think or do anything. I'm saving my energy. Think about it. - It's time to act. - I do. What will you do? - Write. - Write? - What? - Anything. - Nice idea but you have to live. - Like this? You always talk about money! You need money. - Our needs are not the same. - Wait until you're my age. I'd rather die than be like you. Why? We should be ashamed of having more than others. Ashamed of being so happy! - We have to live. - And breathe... just a little. I only take what I need. Tell Breugel to forget it. - No job? - No. - Only when everybody has one! - You'll have a long wait. To each his own... I wait and you rush ahead. - It stinks in here. - Open the window. Ever think of jumping? - Never. To each his own! Do you know how science defines life? Gradual deterioration culminating in death. Don't fret about me. I'm going to Tampon. - Where? The Reunion Islands. I'm done with your bullshit. These are my pyjamas. I met a girl... I'm going to bed early... How is the show going? - There were lots of people at first but not now. - What do you play? - A whore. I open a widow and call to a passer-by. - And it takes the whole evening? - I love acting. - What are you paid? - 15 francs. God! - You accept that? - Wouldn't you? I'll do anything. But when we implode... the heart is willing but the mind can't. We try but we can't hold on. - And you're afraid. - We feel invisible. People forget us as soon as we go. I don't exist for anyone... and I don't care. - It's your job. - No. The job is fine. I'm part of the decor. - I'm at peace. - And then? We all die one day. You were going to call. We have guests. Leave them a minute. I'll change my shoes. - No kiss? - Yes. - A whole day is long. - Very. - Did you go straight home? - Yes. I hung Madam Renken in my room. I was happy. - Do you play golf? - No. Why? With so much land you could. - You must sleep well here. - When I was little but not now. - Why didn't you call? - I wanted to surprise you. - Are you afraid to come back? - Why should I be? In love? You should shave. You scratch. - This is paradise. - It's simply where I live. Where did you live? Here and there. - I thought you'd come home with me. - Tomorrow. We could have eaten at my place... It's stupid to look forward to things. Those are my father's business associates. - I can't just leave. - Business...! - But you understand. - Of course. - You can come in. - No. - I have things to do. - Let me get you something. I'll see you tomorrow. I hope you like salmon sandwiches. - Where tomorrow? - At the supermarket at noon. What's wrong? Nothing. Close your window or you'll catch cold. May I sit down? Sorry I couldn't give you a lift. My car is full of plants. It's ok. - What do you do? - Whatever. - Ah, a part-time worker? - Why that? Just asking. - Would you like a drink? - Ok. I'm with the radio. - May I interview you? - Sure. - How old are you? - 30. - Where were you born? - La Br√©vine... Swiss Siberia! What do your parents do? Dad is a crook. Mom is a saint. Meaning? He gives in to everything. He's frightened. Crooks are always feminine. He's probably in prison. How does that feel? I'd like to say hello to him. We're so much alike. He is handsome. - And your mother? - A beautiful saint. She divorced him. We like our solitude. - Do you believe in God? - No longer and not yet. And mankind? I believe in the starving desert jackal. When I see one I know it's a jackal. When I see a man, I know he is just a man. Corporal! The Scipion has set sail and friendship is gone. Why are you still here? Do you like me? If I had you killed I would understand and that would solve everything. It's time to rise and be free. I've lived free for sometime now. But that's not it! It is better to live and love with a pure heart. We purify ourselves as we can... I seek the essence of life. I could have you killed and you'd be finished! Open up, William. It's me. - It's Noelle. - The lift! We need to talk. I'm trying to sleep. - He is sound asleep. - I'm not! No... "Nada" "Nadja" " The plain is vast... "... so vast! " Fuck! - She isn't coming. Follow me. - What? - But... - We know about the supermarket. Understand? - Oh... I was just saving money. - That isn't funny. Pick him up at Bel Air Place. I'll wait for you. Can I look for her? She's waiting. I have your word. You have 2 minutes. The police take William B. He gets 2 days which gives Inspector Vogel all the time he needs. - Is it bad? - Yes. Can I help? - I'll call tomorrow. - Tomorrow? I have a problem. May I come? I have to go alone. - What is it? - Can I borrow a car? - Take mine. - Warm it up before going. - Ok. I'm busy. Hello, may I speak with Mr. Paux? Polinario? How are you? How was Dauville? Great. Lousy. I'm sick of gambling in Divonne with it's immigrant mafia. I'll be in Paris Friday. By plane. 9:45pm. Orly. Can you fetch me? Will there be women? Great. See you Friday. Bye. Someone is waiting for me. - How is the job? - 1,000 a month. - Looking for clients? - I'm taking my mom out. - Is she still alive? - And always complaining. Lucky you! William Tudor sent me. - Do you have news of him? - I will this afternoon... any minute now. A friend of ours is waiting for us in a caf√©. Let's go. - I'll get dressed. - Good. - Ladies only! - Ok, I'll wait over there. - Wait outside. - I'll start the car. Ok, then do it! It's grey! - We're out of petrol. - Then how do we get there? On foot. We're only 5 minutes away. - And the car? - I'll come back for it. Why a gun? - That is my business. - Do you use it? Sometimes. - And William? - It's not his style. Let's go. I'd love to live here. - Shall I shoot a bird? - No. Watch me. I'll get it. Idiot! Don't crush my onions! - What's wrong? - It's my ankle. - Does it hurt? - Just a little. Look at me. - And William? - He's our friend. Let's go see my friend at the caf√©. Kids! Divorne. Hey, Divorne! What are you doing? He may be with the American girl. - Can we go to town with you? - Yes. - What luck! I almost forgot. - What? To reserve my ticket. It's how I usually travel. - When is the flight to Paris? - Morning or afternoon? - Morning. - 7:50, 9:40 and 11:50. - 9:40. - Do you want to reserve? - No. I'll come back. - Ok. - You bore me to death. - I know. Tell me about him. - We're friends. - How's that possible? - We are kindred spirits. - Really? - We are very similar. - You are ridiculous. You are so boring! He should be here soon. Stop tempting me. Do you want some? Don't fool yourself. I've seen nice legs before. - Is it good? - What? Your book. " I am alone. I want what I don't have and no longer possess. " This is how we live and die. " - Shall I read it again? - No, I understand. - He said he would be at the caf√©. - Why there? It's a good place to hide. - And if he doesn't show up? - Why? Are you really bored? - I don't like your looks. - You're shrivelled. - You didn't develop well. - You are worse in a suit. - And naked? I don't want to know. I love William. - Another kiss? - No. We're just waiting for William's friend. Stop or I'll scream. - What is this? - A fireworks factory. My uncle worked here. - What did he do? - He made rockets. - Did they go bankrupt? - No. There was an explosion. - Now he has a hook. - Where? In place of his hand. - Now he works for Altdorf. - The same job? Yes. He loves the flames, the colour, the noise. You like this. - Come on. - No! You promised me news of William. - Just a little kiss? - Bastard! Idiot! - You're vulgar. - I talk like I live. And I live better than William. - You come with me. - Where? Where are we? - You like it? Make a guess. - Does he live here? - Unfortunately, yes. Do you smell the mildew? You smell nothing? Grimy! What filth! That's William. He lives like a wild man. I couldn't do it. Cigarette? Are you keeping it as a souvenir? What a neighbourhood. I see why he never brought you here. You wouldn't have been cold, he has a thick blanket. Another communist. - I'm going to be sick. - It's the smell. I don't know what it is. You're not used to this sort of thing. I didn't think it possible. It's not your style. Everyone's destiny is different. Everything is broken. Guys like him drink and fight. I know a lot of them. They are undisciplined. You will never love me. Get undressed! - Another step and I'll shoot. One more step and I'll kill your girl. You don't believe me, do you? Take that, coward! Don't move or you're dead. - Give me the gun. - Never. - I'll shoot. - Hand it over. Come get it. Don't be an idiot. Now get out of here. And you, too! PYROTHECHNICS ROAD subtitles Douglas Fowley Jr.
