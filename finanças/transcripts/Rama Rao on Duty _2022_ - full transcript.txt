SANSKRIT CHANTS SANSKRIT CHANTS SANSKRIT CHANTS SANSKRIT CHANTS "Sri Lakshmi Venkateshwara." What happened? What are you doing there? Are you not able to sleep? The hand of the body has come out due to rain. I'll go and check that. You go back to sleep. Oh, is it? Can't you check that in the morning? We must bury it before anyone sees it. We should be very cautious. - Okay. -You go to sleep! Long live, our leader! - Long live, our leader! Long live, our leader! - Long live, our leader! Long live, our leader! - What is this fuss, sir? Long live, our leader! - Long live, our leader! Hey, stop... stop... stop it. - Long live, our leader! What about you? What is this, sir? He is not there anymore. - Actually, he is... You speak as if you are a descendant of Raja Satya Harishchandra. The entire office overlooked us even when we were in power because you had the backing of Ramarao, didn't you? That's why I made him transfer from here and replaced you as in-charge, not to listen to your boogie stories. to clear all our pending files and NOCs. Sir, he is yet to be relieved due to all the cases charged against him by people like you. First of all, sir, don't talk about Ramarao sir in a disrespectful manner. I won't accept that. So what? Who cares By the way, why have you switched sides towards him? That whoever works with Ramarao turns into an honest man, is it? Leave all this. I want all my files cleared right now. If not, I've come prepared to burn you and your office down to ash. - What is this, sir? - Hey, pour some petrol on him. Hey, pour petrol on him and set him on fire No... please sir no. Now, our work will be done Whenever my left eye twitches, I've suffered terrible consequences. Something is going to happen. What happened? What happened? I don't care who you are or which party you belong to. Whoever it is, just because you are in power if you come here with a plan to dig the mountains, fill up the lakes, grab the lands, or any such irregularities Out! Out! Hey, put out the fire, quickly. I've read all the reports regarding Ramarao's case. But, I want to hear the summary from you Of course, your Honour. After tracking all his activities, his expenditures, and the files that he processed we have come to the conclusion that, in simple words, Mr Ramarao is highly controversial in his deeds but very calculative in his moves. With your permission, I would like to start with Indo-Japanese power project case While I am still in service as a Collector... To lay the foundation stone for the nuclear power plant that our Indian government is going to build, makes me feel delighted and a little proud too. Although the acquisition of 3200 acres of land by our State government... is the key factor to this achievement but the brilliance and indulgence of the Special Collector, Mr. Ramarao, deserves all the credit, is what I truly believe. This agreement should be terminated immediately (Sloganeering) Mr. Haruki Hayato* Sir, as a token of appreciation to Mr. Ramarao, please felicitate him. Please, sir. I asked you to write me a short speech but instead you used the opportunity to show off your language proficiency, didn't you? Do not sign the MoUs. Sir. Sir* What happened? The farmers found that company officials entered through the back gate. They are trying to barge in by breaking the barricades. Listen, although the company officials have protection, still, according to the rules inform the SP. - Ramarao... come -Yes, sir. come on.. Throw stones I won't let you sign the MoUs at any cost. come on.. Throw stones - Come in... -Sir, come in. Take him in.. Go in Don't spare anyone. Hey, Ramarao! Why are you creating havoc after you have been paid the full amount for the acquisition? Do you think you are a revolutionist? Yes, this is a revolt. Every day in a farmer's life is a revolution... and people like you get to eat the outcome of that revolution... and yet suppress us with your hegemony. What? Why are you harping so much? Everything is done with due diligence. Now, get out of here. Get out. Out! What happened... so many people here? Why are there so many people? This is going to turn out to be much bigger chaos than expected Our people are not able to control them, let us inform our MLA. Come, let's go. Look, Ramarao. All the hard work seems to be going in vain. Orders were received from superiors to solve the problem before it escalates. Look at the bandage on your head and bruises on my body. Do you think the problem has not escalated yet? The only solution is to arrest them all and continue our work. They are not farmers, sir. They are goons! What are you staring at? Ramarao, you are complicating the problem further. Leave him. If this protest gains traction and gets featured in National media then this venture would be halted for an indeterminate period. That is why the Central minister is stepping in to push for compromise. Our high command has an indirect share in this project. If this agreement is not signed today, I will be sidelined by the party. Sir. They are here, creating havoc at the last minute, to blackmail us. Ramarao, we bought the land at Rs. 7000 to 8000 per acre but the amount mentioned in the MoU is Rs. 40000 per acre. That means, without investing a penny, the Benamis of Delhi high command gets 20% and our State government gets 30% share. That's why we are contemplating about settling this issue... by giving more money to the farmers, some officially and some unofficially. You go home. I'll talk with the farmers. They will get more aggressive in your presence. Go. Go home, Ramarao. That day, Ramarao was abruptly sent home and the MoU was signed after settling the issue with the farmers by paying them Rs. 20000 more per acre. After a few days, MLA Satyanarayana got suspicious about Rama Rao. A case has been filed against Ramarao for instigation of protest by leaking the confidential rates... mentioned in the MoU to the farmers and thus encouraging them to revolt. There is another case filed against him... for taking commission of the 7 crores extra compensation that was paid to the farmers. Ramarao... Ramarao... Ramarao... Mr. Ramarao, before pronouncing the judgement, do you want to say something to the court? Thank you for asking, your Honour. If I've done something wrong they must have presented it to be ten times grave than what it is. But if I've done something good then they hide that good in their heart. There is nothing more that I wish to say, your honour. Since 3 out of the 17 cases filed against the accused were very complicated, And due to that reason, the court constituted the fact-finding committee. And the court directed the committee to state the facts of these cases... and pass a common order in respect of all the cases. Considering the reports submitted by the committee and after analysing all the rest of the cases, the court declares that none of the allegations charged against Sub-Collector, Mr. Ramarao holds ground On a personal note, It looks like Mr. Ramarao has religiously followed the 'oath of allegiance'.... that every government employee takes on the day of his induction. Understanding that authority is responsibilities coupled with service, although some of his deeds are beyond his duty but yet they fall under the legal obligations, hence the court has decided to squash all the allegations charged against him. Hey, Ramarao. Look here. You can escape from the judiciary but you can't escape me. I will see your end. Why is he laughing? What does that mean? Your memory is too fickle. His smile has many meanings And his actions have a millions of meaning. If the great intellect Chanakya and a warrior are forged into one to form a human being, the result will be Ramarao! "He*s a Master or a Servant?" "Or the king of the Crowd." "He*s not easy to crush." "Leader of the pack." "Sincere though devious, his soul so brave and pure." "Does he obey? Does he violate?" "One shall never know." "Dodging the duties don't go well with him." "King of the crowd." "Leader of the pack." "Gunshots of fire and the country is his mother." "And now like him no other." "He*s never never never gonna tire." "Law oppresses that tricks the crowd." "But the rich are free from it all." "For him it is equality, his nation above it all" "He*s not just a rebel. He is son of the land." "Playing with fire." Who is this slick? "Dodging the duties don't go well with him." 'He is king of the crowd." "He's the leader, leader, leader of the pack." What is this, Uncle? You have very little luggage to carry! I thought since it is just for two to three days* So, he has sent the remaining luggage to our hometown. We shall stay with you for just another 2 days. Anyways, we are worried about the condition of our house. You are not going anywhere, Uncle. There is a vacant house behind our home, I have asked my father to talk to the owners. You are coming with us and from now on, you too are the residents of Gummasamudram. Henceforth, we shall stay together. I don't know how to thank you. We couldn't have stayed away from you both. Hey, little one! Come, let's buy some gifts for your grandpa and grandma. - We'll be right back, son. - Come, hurry up! Are you busy packing your stuff? Sir, come in. Come, sit. I'll get some coffee for you. Put some poison in it too, dear. Having poison is far better than bearing the twists that your husband throws at me. Go and get a cup of coffee, without poison. Come, sir. Come, sit. Ramarao, I had a doubt. It got clarified very recently. So, all those riots and havoc were completely pre-planned, was it? What you saw from the inside was far from what happened on the outside! Get them! I won't let them sign the MoUs at any cost. By the time I got the situation under control, the henchmen of the MLA who were in disguise as the security personnel of the company officials got a little excited. How do you expect me to hold myself back if a farmer is hurt? Why? Our government won't spare a penny for us if we ask them to solve our problems, but if we demand compensation for the damage they caused, they'll shower currency notes upon us. That's why! I have seen people taking bribes to do their work. I have seen people taking bribes for not doing some work. But for the first time, I am looking at someone risk his job and life to do service to the public. Really, I am proud of you Ramarao. Sorry, I think I came at the wrong time. No, you came at the right time. Your husband is a firebrand. He spreads light without causing any noise. Let him shine even in his hometown. Your husband has idiopathic insomnia, that is, he won't fall asleep until he has completed the work that he has taken up. Don't try to make him fall asleep. The public requires him to be awake. I'm sorry, I couldn't stop the transfer. I'm going to miss a revolutionary officer. Come, dear. Grandfather. - Come, my dear. - How are you? How are you doing? -Fine. All the evil eyes* My crazy mom! All the negative energy* Let everything be warded off you! Anant, break this so that all negative aura captured in this is chased away. Go. - Okay, I shall do it, ma'am. Come in... - Uncle, Aunty, let's go. -Come in. Ramarao, I and your father are childhood friends. Prasad Rao, I'm saying this as I have the opportunity to say... do you know how beneficial it is for our people that your son has been transferred here as an officer? Keep quiet, man. Don't hero-worship him. - Uncle, tea! -Give it to them. - Brother, tea! -Ananth, how are you? Tea? Tea, sir? Enjoy your tea - Will you have some tea? -No. Okay. Ramarao will join the duty after the festival. Publish the news in your paper such that everyone is aware of his arrival. One more thing, on the day of the Kanuma festival, we are sacrificing the lamb to serve full meals for the people. How many are going down? Hey, Anant! Are you short of money or what? Had you called Seenayya from the mutton shop, he would have done the job for you! Do you think I can't do it? Didn't I cut off three heads with ease now? - Hello, dear. How are you? -I'm good, sir. What is this? You have already taken the offerings but now asking for more? Give him, the old man must be hungry. Okay, take it. Grandpa! Hi Prashant! Ananth, your Aunt and our in-laws must be still engaged in their household chores. Go and get them. I have to clear the payment of the cooks, later I'll go and get them. - Give, give. What is this? - Always talking about money* He still nothing has changed I'll take your leave. Bye. Why are you all being so stubborn? Don't you know about CI sir? If he finds it out, he will shoot you down. - Sir. -What? This time, we can't come, sir. If you force us, you will have to face the consequences. How dare you raise your voice! Why police are beating them? What is happening over there? Will you come or not? What happened, sir? Why are beating them? Why should we tell you? get away from here Go. Then, tell me. I'm the newly appointed deputy collector and also the MRO of this zone. You tell me, why are the police beating you? This is not new for us, sir. Whenever there is a festival their CI, instructs them to catch hold of 4-5 people from our community and force us to hunt and then cook for them. They make us work hard for the whole day and at the end of the day, we aren't paid a single penny. You tell me, sir; don't we the right to celebrate festivals as well? Look, they won't come along with you. You may go. Or else, I would have to take action against all four of you. - Come. Let's inform CI sir. -Thank you, sir. - Careful. Go now. -Come, let's go. Kabir? I was working in the port, sir. The port* Enough! don't repeat the same thing. It's not a big deal for me That is not some pocket-size matchbox that one can hide it from plain sight, the consignment consists of 450 tons of product in huge containers. It is not so easy to hide it from my eagle eyes! Sir, those guys* Enough! Please! A wise man is speaking here, have some manners. Go tell your boss, I'll let him know when I find the mall. - Go. -Okay, sir. You tell... Sir, while we were trying to get those guys, someone threatened to take action against us. What are you doing? I'm doing my RMP practice, brother. How is it going? It has been good, brother. On top of that, I provide medical services. Okay then. Okay, brother. If I have any work with you, I'll take some time out and meet you. Hey! Who was that? Who threatened to take action against us? Instead, of beating the shit out of him, you came running to me, is it? Go and search for him. Get him here. We don't have to look for him, sir. He is coming here itself. Where? There, sir. Who are you, man? What are you staring at? Why did you stop my men from taking away those criminals? Don't you know that obstructing the police from doing their duty is a crime in itself? - You know that. -I know. Police officers like you don't arrest criminals when they have committed a crime, instead, you'd arrest them at your leisure for your personal work. What are you talking about? Where are you from? I'm not here to listen to your preachings. Didn't you warn them of taking action? What action are you going to take? If you are Deputy Collector and MRO, sit in your office and do your mundane work of signing and stamping the documents, do not interfere with the Police department. Look, I'm not among those officers who keep themselves confined to the office by signing the certificates and distributing ration cards. As an executive magistrate of the sub-division of this district, I am responsible for operating preventive sections of the code of criminal procedures. By the way, in this specific incident, I clearly observed a violation of fundamental rights, which is a crime. And since the crime was committed by the police, all of you* I? *will have to appear and explain your stand in my office If you extend this issue any further. Sir? Sir? Isn't he an MRO? Then how can he call you to his office to answer him? Are we answerable to an MRO, sir? How would I know? But by the way and swag with which he told it seems he must be right. - Hey* -Sir? He has successfully cancelled our recording dance program for this year. The girl that has been hired for this time's recording dance will make you all blush red. Get up. If I enter the garden... the flowers grind their teeth out of jealousy. Oh! - And when I write my name* -What happens? When I write my name, the paper loses its consciousness. Is it? Is your name that intoxicating? Yes! What is your name, lassie? See-sa. Yes. See-sa. 'See' stands for Seekakulam... and 'Sa' stands for Sarangi. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. For some, I am a bottle of honey. For some, I am a bottle of wine. For some, I am a bottle of spices. For some, I am a bottle of juices. But irrespective of that, I would take everyone on a trip to heaven. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. I can kiss you without touching you. I can hug you without holding on. I can make you break a sweat without coming close to you. I will make you feel like heaven without my presence I will stay where I am! I will stay still where I am, yet I would make each part of you jump out of excitement. How? How? How? I will stay still where I am, yet I would make each part of you jump out of excitement. Only my photo is enough! Only my photo is enough to satiate your desires! My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. My name is Seesa. Rama Rao, I missed your village dance program when I went to my in-laws home last time. What happened to Raghav? Why did you grow a beard? As I am on leave for a month now, I've been too lazy to shave. I'll shave it next week when I leave for the office. What about you, door-darshan? If not for the festival, it seems you are not to be found in the village? You are a free bird, Raghav. You may speak whatever you want. You have a state government job that will pay you even if you sit idly. Our situation is not like before, dude. Many private channels have emerged in the market. If we won't work hard for the entire month, it is difficult to sustain. Gangadhar, no matter how hard you work, you can't sustain yourself anyways. Many private channels like Gemini and Etv have made their way into towns, now their next destination is villages. Dear, Saleem. Same is in your case. Cell Phone technology! Is developing at a rapid pace. All your landlines are going to vanish in the near future. That's why we will work hard and make our department sustainable. All the childhood friends are having a get-together, Ramarao, do you feel restrained after being transferred to your hometown? There are no problems that require your intervention, nor there is any work to do. When are you joining? Tomorrow. He is going to be a busy man from tomorrow. I don't know the timing of the new officer but the old one used to come at 11 am and leave at 1 pm sharp. It was so comfortable for us. Hey Garjana, what are you doing there? Sir has already arrived. - He is meeting everyone. Come fast. - Sir has arrived already. Sir has arrived. I'm coming, coming. Hello, sir. My name is Garjana Shyam Swaroop, sir. I work here as an attender. Why do you strain yourself, sir? I will send them out Meanwhile, you can sit in that seat, sir. I'm giving 15 minutes to you. The entire staff should assemble here. - Is everyone present? -Yes, sir. I'm going to tell you two things. One, I should not find a heap of files and a crowd of people in the office where I'm in charge. The thing that should be there is the thought that I am underpaid. That means, the feeling of working more than what you are being paid for. Two, doing only those jobs which have additional income like tinkering in the revenue files giving NOCs to stone query, mining of hills, or sand mining, giving certificates for birth, death, and nativity, property tax collections, and clearance of assets, is not enough. Stop scratching your head and adjusting your pants. Remember, we are both the boss and the servant of almost all the sections mentioned in our constitution. Any questions. Only those who believe they can be prompt to both these conditions are allowed inside. The rest of you can apply for No-pay leave and try for transfer. Okay? There is no privacy and no protocol in my office. I should be able to see your work and you should be able to see my work. Only progress that matters. Sir, his application has been pending for a long time. He is a tenant farmer. He has applied for work in the 2 acres of government-owned wasteland. But he belongs to the upper caste. He was clearly told that we can't give him that land to work but he is still roaming up and down this office. Even now, he has been torturing me to allow a chance to speak to you. Sir. If a farmer's hands are not stained with mud, our hands won't have food to hold. Write his name in the 13th column and get the file, I'll sign it. The government will file a case, by the time the court gives its judgement I'll be retired. And meanwhile, he can continue farming. Sir, I wished to own at least one cent of land before my death. Now only because of you has my wish fulfilled. I'll harvest jewels in the land that you gave, sir. I'll harvest jewels! Okay, okay. Come along with me now. Come. Can one person do so much work? He has made us complete the work that was pending for the last few years in a matter of just a few weeks. He is great, sir. Before him, there would have been a queue of 50-60 people still waiting at 6 pm while it was office closing time. But now, we still have half an hour to go but there are just hardly 2 or 3 people. He has done some magic, sir. Some tremendous magic it must be We have worked under many people but with time, we have forgotten everyone. But under him, we have forgotten the passage of time. He will be remembered forever. - Ananth! -Brother? After your shopping in the town, don't come to my office and disturb me on the pretext of Aunt and your sister-in-law. Okay, brother. Spare me for once. Brother, look at him. Look, how he is walking in the middle of the road. Hey, Ananth! Ananth! Hey, old man! If you shut your ears, how will you know what's coming from behind you? If a vehicle from behind rams into you, you are going to be a gone case. Idiot! Why did you get so hyper? Why did you hit that old man? -Hey, go from here. - Hey, Get lost -Shut up. Sir? Not knowing that this would be such a difficult task, I agreed to it only because I thought you'd solve it. A fool will do foolish things but with utmost enthusiasm. Similarly, you go into the forest and come back empty-handed and then repeat the same thing the next time. Absolutely useless! Damn! Sir, I think the 'maal' has been exported from an alternative route. No. Not at all. The 'maal' has not been exported and I got this information from the Don himself who receives the exported 'maal'. Just because you couldn't trace the 'maal', don't create a fanatical story that 'maal' has left the country. Then sir, shall we assign another 5 teams to indulge in combing operations? In that case, there is a higher possibility of finding the 'maal'. Take your relatives as well. What a dumbass you are! The search operation must happen with utmost confidentiality. It is very dangerous if the government finds even a small clue about this. Finding hundreds of crores worth of red sandalwood at once will send jitters across the country. Moreover, its security will be beefed up. If any of these two happens, they will kill me. Maintain low-key profile searching. - But increase your pace a bit. -Okay, sir. Go - Good morning, sir. -Morning - Morning. -Morning. Malini. - Malini. -Good morning, sir. This is Malini too. Malini again. This is Malini too... What is this? Her name is Malini, sir. She is from the village Thimmasamudram. She has applied for a change of the heir for her assets We rejected it. As a protest, she keeps writing letters to us. She belonged to a once aristocratic family. What is this, sir? Rama? It's been so many years since I last saw you! But you are still the same. Come, sit. That's okay, I'll sit here. What is your name, dear? Ramalakshmi. Just a minute... I'll come again Are you going to school? Good girl. Take it, Rama. Tell me, when did you come to the village? You have a son, right? How is he? What happened? Why aren't you speaking? What happened? Rama, go and play. This is one amongst the many turns that my life took. My husband's name is Surendra. He was working with my Dad taking contract work in the North. He was very close to my dad even before my marriage. After the death of my parents, we settled here. Due to the risks involved in contracts we faced heavy losses, and along came a lot of hardships. He left home to meet one of his friends named Varma who was about to start a new business venture. But he never came back. I have cried so much that my tears have dried up by now. But, how did you get them? Recently, I got transferred here as a Deputy collector. Is it? Is there anyone else in the house? While he was searching for my husband my father-in-law died in an unfortunate accident. As if this was not enough, people who would come here to casually meet Surendra have now started to come only to threaten me for their money. I am fed up with roaming around police stations, lawyers, and your office. That's why I started to write a letter every day. It is not going to solve anything but by expressing my protest, at least, I would find some solace amidst my hardships is what I believe. This will solve your problem. These letters have brought me here and from here on this is my responsibility. It is because of you that I lost my love. It's been 7 years since Rama, suppressing the pain within him, left me with a smiling face. Now that I am in a hopeless situation, he came looking for me and provided me with assurance. This is making me nostalgic. Ramarao, hearing this name itself fills me up with confidence that I am protected by divine power. The girls of my school lived like wild lionesses as Ramarao was the SPL of our school. Do you want to be hurt? - Come on, hit me. Let's go. I felt some unknown connection with Rama from the day I saw him. Ananth, why are you killing the ants? Sir has already started the class, get in. As time passed, in my head, we became us. What is Hindi language? National language. National language. It is okay if you don't know Telugu but if you don't know Hindi, you will be deemed useless in this society. Sir, learning a other language along with our mother tongue is not wrong but looking down upon our mother tongue is very wrong. Hindi is not our national language, sir. It is an official language. Ramarao's style and perspective regarding every topic were unique. As days passed, we started to fall in love with each other. Two buses have already left, if you won't leave me still, even the last bus will leave. Is it? I accepted the fact that you like government jobs as much as me. And for that, post your graduation, you have spent the last 4 years on the job training in the town away from me, yet I've been patient. I can't anymore. Please get a job soon and tie the knot. Please marry me, Rama. Test and interviews will be over by next month, and afterwards, I'll act as per your say. Okay? When will you be back? Next month, 25th. Okay? My brain is swirling and twirling around. The moon followed my footsteps stealthily. The world echoes like the waves of nightingales. My heartbeat sounds like ushering your name. I'm laughing in different languages. Girl, you made this heart tremble and pulled it towards you. The sky is pouring out colours and clouds are swollen due to the burden. The breeze spreads across the scent of weed. The inebriety of your kiss is stronger than that weed. My brain is swirling and twirling around. The moon followed my footsteps stealthily. You doused my burning lips with your kiss such that the bird of love landed in the nest of my heart. Lord Rama! It means that you will get married to someone like Lord Rama The world echoes like the waves of nightingales. A strange love between a rock and the mirror has unfolded. When the mirror hit the rock, the rock exploded into pieces. Am I in hell or heaven? I'm flying high after falling in love with you. My darling and sweetheart, I would love only you. Will you be my better half for the rest of my life? My brain is swirling and twirling around. The moon followed my footsteps stealthily. You doused my burning lips with your kiss such that the bird of love landed in the nest of my heart. The world echoes like the waves of nightingales. My heartbeat sounds like ushering your name. I'm laughing in different languages. Girl, you made this heart tremble and pulled it towards you. I've had many dreams about my marriage with Rama and the life after that. We were each other's pillar of support in every adversary that came our way. As expected, Ram secured a job. While I was lost in the ecstasy that there will be no obstacle in our marriage... and everything is happening as per plan This way, go this way - Where? -Towards the priest's home. Ok I have some work there. Come, let's get that done. - Hello, sir. -Hello. Hello. Uncle* Brother... - Uncle* -Ramarao, how are you? I'm doing good, aunty. Mahalakshmi* Please sit down The boy's family has arrived. Get the girl here Okay? She is my only daughter, her name is Nandini. What is this, dad? Who is this girl? Don't you know about Malini? That's why I have called them. Malini is married. What? How can she get married, dad? I don't know the reason. But we could not anticipate how you would react to the news of Malini and we were depressed. As a father, it is my responsibility to search for an able partner for you. Further, it is your decision. No, dad. Give me some time and then the decision is yours. I know that you would have never agreed to this marriage for any selfish reasons. There must be a strong reason behind it. You don't have to hang your head, Malini. Love is something related to only both of us but marriage involves both our families. Regarding our love life, any one of us can take a decision. But regarding our marriage, the whole family comes into the equation. I didn't ask you to come to question you. I just wanted to see you as it had been many days since I last saw you. Malini, look at me once. All these days, I was suffering, not knowing what answer I should give to you for getting married to someone else without intimating you. But you lifted that weight off my heart like one would put a baby down on the ground. When my father came home that day after fixing my marriage to his partners' son, the happiness I saw on his face was not seen ever before. The only thing that I had to do to stop that marriage was to take your name. But I couldn't take your name as I didn't want you to be the reason for him betraying his promise. That's it. The marriage happened. She was supposed to be our daughter-in-law. But destiny had other plans. Didn't you ask if she needed any monetary help? She would kill me if I talk about money, dad. But she did apply for the transfer of assets, didn't she? Can't you sanction that? If gets the authority over the property, she could at least solve some of her problems. No. This seems like a simple application but legally this is a huge hassle. The property of the missing people can't be touched for 7 years of the missing period. Only after that can we apply Evidence act, 107 and 108, under presumption of death, can we transfer the title deeds of the property. Okay. Do whatever the best you can. You are just repeating the same old stale story since six months! Sir, we might find some clues if we search in 15-20 more villages. You are roaming around the villages on the pretext of investigation but haven't gathered any information about the freight. Tell me if you are incapable of doing it, and I'll apply for leave and roam around in mufti. No, sir. Soon I'll complete the work and provide you with all the relevant information. Believe me, sir. Okay. Let's see. You may go. Okay, sir. Why has Mr. Magistrate come this way? How may I help him? This is the missing case. Lady, are you Malini? The one who keeps writing letters all the time? I haven't found any lead in this case, shall let you know if I find anything. You may go. It has been more than a year since the complaint has been brought to your notice. It seems the FIR is yet to be filed, isn't it? Go and complain the jurisdiction where that person went missing. They will file the FIR. It is your responsibility to file an FIR irrespective of the jurisdiction. Okay, you didn't file the FIR. What is the progress that you have made so far in this case? Hello. What are you asking me about? Progress and attendance? I don't answer to my senior officials and this man has come like a* Okay. Let's imagine we haven't made any progress yet. No, let's just imagine. The missing person's wife and his relatives must have searched for him, no? What progress did they make? People are always on their toes to blame the police department... just because we are always available for service. By the way, why do you have a special interest in this case? Sorry madam, don't think otherwise. I'm not here to plead along with her for appropriate action. As a subdivision Magistrate, I've come to enquire about a person missing from my area of jurisdiction. Hey, Satti! Come here Sir! Make someone file a cheating case against a man named Surendra who has debts all over the villages. Okay sir. Close the case by filing a report that he has willingly disappeared from the village. If I keep answering every Tom, Dick andHarry, even 48hrs a day is not enough. You may leave, we are not serving free food over here. What a puny life! I am answerable to every Tom, Dick, and Harry, it seems! The overaction that he did in Srikakulam has resulted in his demotion from a Sub-Collector to a temporary post. He was enquiring as if he is the home minister of the country. He thinks we have no work to do and are being idle the entire time. Sir! Why did you come again? Since you were about to file a wrong case to close his case, I've personally come to prove that it is not a cheating case but a missing case. Then I will make you investigate this case officially. After you took charge of this station, there have been two lock-up deaths so far. On the pretext of enquiry, I'll make you climb the stairs of my office every day three times and then make you sit at home for the next three years. Is it? - Yes. Guys, look if that man is still around. He has gone, sir. I can't take it anymore. Who is he? He has been giving nightmares only through the rules in our constitution. He is Varma. Look, the gift box he has been holding has the name, Varma, inscribed on it. We must gather his address. If Surendra approached Varm for some help in his business then Varma too must be a businessman. Okay. Get the old calendars and diaries that you have at home. Okay. Here. Kiddo, is Mr. Varma available at home? My father is not here. Are you his friend? Who are you? What do you want? That means the person you are looking for, Surendra, had left home saying he is going to meet Varma and since then he has been missing. Am I right? That too, a year ago* You came this far unnecessarily, my son has gone to Dubai a long time ago. By the way, my son has no friend named Surendra. What is this? Is he not your son? The groom standing beside him is Surendra. - Without being friends, did he* -Maybe they are* So what? You are hiding something? Yes, I am! So what? Leave from here. What are you looking at, dear? Come, let's go in. Okay, I'll let you know after the enquiry. - Hello, sir. -Hello. This contains the details that you had asked for, sir! Ok Give me two minutes. Come here... What is this? Why are you writing all the details with two hands? Wait, I'll tell you. Okay, Raghava. Call anyone amongst them on whom you have the most trust. - Sridhar? -Sir. Sir, as you identified, our check post entry shows the passing of 10-11 containers of granite through it. Generally, there is a mystery around the containers carrying granite to Mangalore. Aunty, didn't you ask for cow milk? Here, take it. Ananth, it is very hot. Come, let's eat together. No, brother. I'm getting late. You are a lucky man, you have some property to rely on and have a nice job in your hand. Someday when I settle down, I'll chill out like you and eat peacefully. I'll take your leave. What is the connection between tiffins and settling down? There is, brother. There is! Why are you upset, dad? I'm not liking what you are doing! You haven't been home for one week. Is searching for Surendra more important than attending the office? This is office work too. If nobody shows interest how will the case move forward? Let it not move at all. Do you have to leave everything aside to help just one person? If you don't mind, shall I say something? Your actions are always intended to help all the people around you. But this time, since you are wandering from place to place just for one person, the same people who praised you would bad-mouth you. Your father hasn't slept for the last four days, son. Even my daughter has been concerned for you. Mahalakshmi, do you want to say something? Nothing? Contrary to what all of you believe, I was not wandering around just for Malini's husband Surendra. It's not the case of one missing person, almost 20 people have gone missing, maybe more than that. We went searching for Surendra and found Varma missing, we went searching for Varma and found his assistant Raja missing, and while searching for Raja we found Venkat to be missing too. I have a huge list of names that follow. I have seen the worn-out eyes of the parents... who are still waiting for their sons not knowing whether he will come back or not, I have seen the siblings who left their studies to fill in the shoes of their elder brother, to feed their families. I met a lady who is down to selling her flesh for her children's sake. My son is my only support. He lost his leg while searching for my son. Not only that, I have strong evidence which suggests that the reason for the missing of these 20-25 people could be the 'plague' that our district is infected with, 'the smuggling of red sandalwood trees'. That is why I have been busy for the past few days. I have not been home for just one week and you all have started complaining but just imagine the plight of the families who have not seen their... loved ones for the past few months. A wife is looking for her husband; Parents are waiting for their son and a son or daughter are looking for their father for the past several months. I am doing this for them. I am submitting all the details to the police, they will look after this issue. I won't be involved in this anymore, okay? I am leaving. Okay. It was not for you, it was for my son. - Morning Sir -Ya. Morning, morning. Again? How did you connect these two events, Mr. Ramarao! Great! I understand that it is your ploy to paint an ordinary issue with... the colours of red sandalwood smuggling so that I will take it seriously henceforth. Did you get this thought by looking at these plants? I may not match your intellectuality but I am sharp too. This is not my ploy. This is a fact. Which fact? The checkpost register that you mention clearly states it as granite... then how can you call it red sandalwood? There is no granite in Tirupati. Granite is available only in Prakasam district. They export their granite through Madras port. But Peeleru checkpost has the entry of trucks related to Varma. That means, they were headed to Mangalore port. So, the men that left from here to Mangalore have not returned. Okay, agreed. But what is the connection between Surendra's missing and the entries of these containers? Do you imply that Surendra was involved in the smuggling along with Varma? Isn't that a crime? In that case, the rest of the group should also be missing... then why have their families stayed mum? No such missing complaints have come to my notice. Do you have their addresses? Sorry, sir. I don't have any more details. I said I'll prove it to you that it's not a cheating case but a missing case. And, I did. If you want an official memo, I can send that too. No need. I don't need your memo or demo. I'll seriously consider your missing case. It's not a good sign that the freight has come to his notice. Oh no! The law demands several responsibilities from you towards the government but you are not supposed to follow them. There are few standard responsibilities, you must fulfil only those selected few. Instead, if you decide to take up all those responsibilities on your shoulders... and work towards the upliftment of this society then such accidents are bound to happen and you are bound to lose a leg or two. Anyway, it is none of my concern. I'll honestly write a report saying you have caused this accident. Since you directly caused the accident, we have no other choice than to take action against you. In this enquiry committee... I propose six months of suspension for Ramarao. What do you say SP sir? Sir, if you don't mind, I have a humble submission. I feel six months of suspension is a tad bit harsh on him. It was an unintentional accident. Moreover, he helped the people also. So, I propose 3 months of suspension and I request you to consider that I'm okay with this. Thank you, sir. Better be safe than sorry next time, Mr. Ramarao. Thank you, sir. Thank you all for arriving here as soon as I called you. There is a strong reason for which I've called you. After my transfer to this village* During his father's era, the older Verma was our member. He is not our member at all. You may leave. How would we know about a 'maal' driver? What is maal? It could mean anything. I don't know the details. Sir, maal means red sandalwood. Then I got to know that there is a connection between 'maal' and missing people. Bro, all these missing people might be in Karnataka police's custody. Did you check with them? Saleem, nobody from that list is in any police custody. We have checked that already. That's why I started searching for the root cause. The first time I went to Tirupati, I visited the Seshachalam forest and other places to collect information on red sandalwood. There are five layers in the complete smuggling network. Number one, woodcutters. They are poor labourers. They come here from a small place called Jauvadumalai situated near Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. Second, loaders, the locals from the Sheshachalam. They transfer the wood to a secret location. Keepers - they are locals too. They maintain the wood hidden in that secret location for several days. Red sandalwood wood's nature is such that even a small block of the wood would submerge in water but these people safeguard it by hiding it under lakes and ponds for months together. Fourth, transporters, like Varma. They transport the goods from the secret location to the port. Fifth, the exporters. They export the red sandalwood under their company's name but by stating them to be granite, food, or tobacco. The biggest mystery now is the disappearance of transporters who work without much risk. There is a kingpin beyond these 5 layers. In local slang, he is called the Don. Since this time, 12 containers carrying red sandalwood have gone missing, I suspect their men also must be searching for the 'maal'. To help me crack this case, give me all the information you know and do whatever you can. As you all know, I work in Mysore Doordarshan. I have the information about Mangalore port agents. We gathered this information when we did a documentary on red sandalwood smuggling. Do you have any contacts? I'll make a call to Mysore tomorrow itself and get the contacts from my colleague. Like I told you yesterday, I called my office and got the contacts from my colleague. As you suspected, a port agent is looking for the missing 'maal'. You can meet him. Okay, I'll take your leave. OK Brother, you said you are going to the bus stand but you have brought me to the railway station! I have small work to attend to. You leave now. - Brother! -Where are you going? There's someone called Surendra, you don't know him. I'm going to Mangalore to solve his missing case. But tell my family that I have left for Hyderabad. Okay? Go.. go. Ananth? Why are you here? He was an energetic lad. Yes, my dear. I have lost everything. There, he is the one! He took my son along with him and now has brought him back in this state. Ramarao! You will be destroyed! You shall face the wrath of karma! I curse you, you will be surely destroyed! Didn't you say that you were going to Hyderabad by bus? Then why were you on a train to Mangalore? I fear that your Aunt's curse will have an ill effect on our family. I'm afraid that I might have a terrible stroke due to this chaos. Ramarao, please tell me the truth. I'm telling you the truth, dad. That's not the truth, he's lying to you all. Excuse, old man! What did your son say? That the body slipped out of the running train, isn't it? Absolutely not. Somebody threw him off the running train which disfigured the body beyond recognition. Hey, Ramarao. This time I've got you by your cuff. This time, your smartness won't help you escape the law. I've got a strong hold on you! Come, come. Come... let's go to the station. Move! I need to conduct my enquiry. Ramarao! This is not the right time to get involved. The emotions of my people are not in control. You don't need to unnecessarily drag me into trouble. I have to. I have the need as well. By the way, you said something to me when we met for the first time. What was that? Criminals aren*t caught when they commit a crime but are apprehended when the police need them, right? Am I right? Now, I need you. Come, let's go to the station. Moreover, I need to take you to the police station while all the people witness it. No, more than that, you need your job to be secured. Your birth took place in a small hut near the railway tracks of Ongole. The only property your father received from your grandfather was that but and half a dozen pigs. And what you got from your father was beatings all over your body and brands all over your back. Even if you saved every penny of your salary, your total net worth should not exceed ten lakhs. But to date, you own assets worth more than three crores. I have safely preserved every document and passbook that could prove this. Moreover, you secured this job on compassionate grounds against the death of your far-relative... who was working in the police department by producing a fake adoption certificate that states that you were adopted by him in your childhood. One register post by me and you can kiss your job goodbye. Take off your hands. What is happening here? He came in fuming and went back with his tail between his legs. What did you say to terrorize him? What are you up to? Did Ananth buy any property in recent times? Did you notice him transacting any big amount of cash? Stop your interrogation and answer my questions! You are a father yourself, you should know that a son must not lie to his father. I'm not lying to you, dad. I didn't want to hurt you, that's why I concealed the truth from you. You don't have to make up such false stories. I know my Anant very well, he won't indulge in such things. One of these two things is false but my heart is not ready to accept that. To accept others' faults and not accept our loved ones' faults is hypocrisy, dad. I bow to you with folded hands. I'm not as knowledgeable as you are but if you want us to live a peaceful life henceforth, please forgot that Malini's case. Ramarao! Your father has become a debilitated person. He is always lost in his thoughts. Not only him, even your wife... Neither can she confront you nor can she remain mum. She cries in front of her parents but tries to keep a straight face here. Her life has turned into a dilemma! It is your responsibility to bring us back to our normal state. Mahalakshmi, I am not someone who would take up the easy challenges and give up as soon as they toughen up. Anant has raised several questions with his departure, Mahalakshmi. Shouldn't I search for answers to those questions? I'll speak with her. You carry on. Nandini! I prefer to live like a diamond with blemishes instead of a flawless boulder. Have patience for a few more days, everything will be alright very soon. Sit. Sit, dear. Hello. Sir, my granddaughter changed my heart and brought me here. My son is not in Dubai. The truth is, with the fear of humiliation, I stopped searching for the whereabouts of my son. It's been a long time since I heard my father's voice. Recently he has been missing my dreams as well. I am afraid that I'll forget my father's face. Will you help me find my father? My day starts with the question of whether or not should I apply vermilion. No wife should face such a dilemma. You are of the age of my son. I beg you. You are like my father. Please, don't be sad. How can they not be sad? I didn't understand their pain when you told me about it but now I understand. This is not just their problem, it is our problem as well. Find a solution for this. Don't let this go unsolved no matter who stands in your way, not even me. Take this, uncle. What are these numbers, dear? I'll give you a number, - note that down. -Okay, brother. 08592-3451. His name is Suresh. Three loads of tabla. Rs. 6000 for three. What about the amount, brother? Well, we will get the amount ready. Okay brother. Also for the two men, it will be Rs. 250 per day. That means, 2*3*250. And I'll pay them 20000 on their return. I'll give You one more number. Note it down. Okay. 0833-23141. His name is Diwakar. Four loads of cigarettes. For their expenses, both will be given Rs. 300 per day. I'm giving Rs. 300 only because they are your men. After their return, they will be given Rs. 30000 in bulk. You have done your part in the search for your father, dear. We both are a team now. Your mother is downstairs, right? Go and play with her. I and your grandfather will join you soon. Go. What are those numbers, son? This is a code language. This is tabla. This is cigarette. This is chocolate. That means, my son has pulled all of them into smuggling! I had already gathered the numbers that your granddaughter has noted down. I even met their family members. The strange thing is they too are missing. And an innocent Surendra fell into this vile trap. Yes! Poor guy. Can you take me to his family? The day Surendra came to my home, they both had an altercation. You are making a mistake. Had I known that you are involved in smuggling, I would have never asked for your help! Isn't the government selling the same red sandalwood when they need money? Viraj has been a part of this business since a long time. Do you think the government is unaware of this? Everyone is getting their share. I'm just a small link in this humongous network. To be honest, my father's 30 years of honest work have earned him only debts across the village. But on the contrary, I have made a fortune in just the last 3 years. I've even helped many of our friends. Without feeling guilty, take this money and set up your business. Take this. I won't. You might be right that the government is well aware of this smuggling. But if you are caught, Viraj and the other corrupt officers will be safe, and the ones who will suffer are you and your connections. Later they will find another loyalist who will be ready for sacrifice. Look there, the only asset that we can provide to our children is to feed them a morsel off our honest work. Only such kids can bravely face this society and lead a respectful life. If something goes wrong and you end up in jail, what will you tell your daughter then? Forbid this business before things get out of hand. I didn't think from this perspective, buddy. Nowadays, even my father is not happy with my success, in fact, he is suspicious. I will leave this profession before my family finds out about it. Since I've already taken money for this consignment, I have to complete it. If I leave it midway, Viraj would find me and see my end. After finishing this consignment, I'll come along with you. We both will start some other business. I'm so happy to see the change in you. One more thing, the route of our consignment tomorrow is from the internal road next to your town. I will go to the port following the last container. You can come along with me in the car. We'll have a nice time on the journey. I'll drop you off on the way, at your village, and head towards the port later. Why are you hesitating to travel along with me? You are more cowardly than I thought. We would have a red carpet welcome while en route to the port. You need not fear about anything. Come. Come, let's go. I was always suspicious about my son's income stream but I never knew that he was involved in smuggling until that day when Surendra changed him for good. They left the home together and went missing together. What happened? Why did you call me urgently along with the check post entries? As per Varma's family's statement, Surendra was with Varma on the night of their missing. I have a strong hunch that both of them along with... the twenty others have gone missing in our surroundings. Each one of the containers that you noted down at the Pileru checklist had reached Mangalore port. I, myself, checked their entries at every check post. Still! Even the agent that we met through our Doordarshan Gangadhar is baffled by the missing of such a large consignment. Ananth, CI Murali who is searching for something, the missing Surendra, everything is happening around us. Don't you feel that there's something fishy happening around us? No. However you look at it, the matter ends in Mangalore. Also, Ananth attacked you while you were travelling, to stop you from going there. Doesn't that mean that something is going over there? No, no, no. Ananth didn't attack me to stop me from going to Mangalore... he attacked me to kill He was afraid that after my return his true side would be exposed by me. With the span of a short time, between dropping me off and the train starting off from the loop line, if he could gather a gang and come back, that means, he is directly involved with the network. He must have called someone. Yes! I am going to Mangalore But, tell the family members that I'm leaving for Hyderabad. Okay? Go.. go.. go. This is not a photo booth, this is a phone booth. I am kidding. Is he missing? No, he called from here. Umpteen number of people use this to make a call daily. I can't keep a tab of each one of them. Moreover, I'm rather interested in the money that customers give to me than the customers themselves. Even now, when I've been talking to you for so long, I'm yet to see your face. Okay, I need the list of calls made on the night of 23rd, the Friday from 9 pm to 9.30 pm. Are you a police officer? No. Then, I can. If you need the list of that particular day at that particular time, then you need to reverse the list. I'll pay you for doing that. Money? Money makes things so easy, isn't it? Look here. "I am the leader of the labours." "I am the leader of the labours." Saleem, I want the corresponding address to all these numbers by tomorrow morning. Note it down. You are not police, right? Government. Government? Here, these are the photocopies that you asked for. You made me travel for more than 1000 kms since yesterday for the photocopies of the details that I had already given you in writing a very long time ago. And now you are showing me these hills. Tell me what is the matter? All the entries that you had given to me were fake. Those containers along with those men never crossed the Horsley hills area. You are repeating the same thing. The details that I gave you and the photocopy of the entries are the same thing. It is. But the vehicles that crossed the Angallu check post which is 20 kms before Horsley hills never crossed the Gattu check post which is 30kms from the Horsley hills. They faked the entries till Mangalore port to fool everyone. From Gattu check post till Mangalore port, every entry has the same handwriting. That means, only one person has written all of them. Yes. These fake entries were created to divert people like us, far from here. Anyway, we will get more clarity on this after Saleem gives us the details regarding those phone numbers. Ramarao! Sit. Surprise. The second number is of a public telephone from Dharmavaram. It was a short call. A short call means it was used to pass a message about me. The train that I was in halts for a loop line at Dharmavaram and I was attacked at the same spot. The first number that you gave me was a ghost number. It means, it is owned by a person who is not in existence. This seems to be a guest house. Do you know who owns this? Saleem, are you sure about this? I am damn sure, this is his number. According to the call pattern, this phone is used only on Sundays. He is one of the most powerful person in the state. How should we confirm that this number really belongs to him? Let's do one thing. I'll give you a butt phone. If we can connect that to the phone line on Sunday, we can overhear all the conversations happening through that line. This is illegal. But* Let's do it! What did I instruct you and what are you guys doing? Sir, don't scold me because you are afraid. As you instructed us, we all have split into different places and are doing our work without causing any suspicion. Still, if you are afraid of something, let me know, and I'll take care of that. Do you think you are capable of dealing with something that terrorizes me? I am repeating what I had told you all before. Listen to it clearly. I have designed *Operation Maayam* as foolproof. According to that, the communication stream between us should flow like a waterfall - only from top to bottom. That means I would communicate with you through courier boys. I have made this very clear that apart from that there should be no contact between you and me. Yet, your gang member... Anant deviated from this plan and contacted me. It*s not acceptable. Sir, I have called to inform you about the same thing. That Ananth didn't inform me about his supposed mishaps. He sent two of our gang members on a mission and pretended to know nothing about it. We had a big fight over that issue. That was the reason why Ananth directly contacted you. He suffered his fate and died in a train accident. If the assassin is dead that doesn*t mean that it is an accident, idiot. It means that he has been killed. He wanted to kill someone? Yes. If possible, find that person and kill him. Or else, you abscond from there. Sir, we have been waiting for the money for the job that we did a year ago. Moreover, three people from our gang have gone missing. This case is moving into unchartered territory. I don't care where you are selling off the 'maal'. Send me the 25% of the amount, as per our agreement, immediately. Hey! You better watch your words! If you limit the supply of *maal* for another two years, we could sell it for four times the current price. Meanwhile, if I find anyone of you going off-limits... I shall find that rat and gun him down in encounter. Keep the phone down. Have some water. I just realised how big a mistake it is to come here. However, why would he be here at this time? I'm not being sane nowadays. What is happening to me? All this is love. The crazy love that you have towards Rama. Hello, Mr. Ramarao. Get up. I have kept your coffee in your office room. Get up. What has gotten into you? Nothing. Can't you continue your work while having coffee? Get up. Get up, I say. Go. Dear? - Dear, breakfast. -OK Dear? Dear? - Lunch. -Ok... ok Dear? Buttermilk. Buttermilk? Come here. Come, sit. Leave me alone. Now please leave me alone. If you keep hovering around me like this, how would I solve the case? You have a detective's brain. If you can't solve it then nobody else can do it either. Get up. Get up. We have something to talk about. Get up I have a detective's brain? Sit. I have to ask you something. Nandini! Tell me. Aren't you angry at me for ignoring our family and being busy at work? Why would I be angry? Who would help Malini other than us? We must do it. My darling! Is this me? Am I the same person as yesterday? Was it you? Was it you whom I was looking for all this while? Is this me? Am I the same person as yesterday? Was it you? Was it you whom I was looking for all this while? The one with a moustache and a sparkling smile on his face. Imprison this abundance of gold in the hem of my saree. It feels like magic your unfading love for me. The greed for moments of intimacy with you is unwavering. You made me lose myself in your dimples. Our unity has been destined by fate. This unison will last forever. I'll tell you the truth. I have craved only for you. And I have become one with you with all my heart. I have sprouted like a leaflet the new me is your selection. I'm elated to see myself in you. I had kept all these feelings hidden from you. Let me shed all my inhibitions today and confess these feelings to you. You made me lose myself in your dimples. Our unity has been destined by fate. This unison will last forever. Without any complaints and without any celebrations, my bouncy hairs leaned on your chest. All my beauty, I serve it to you. I approached you and bestowed upon you. Let me be so close to you like no one else such that the kohl of my eye marks your cheeks. In this pitch dark night, acknowledge this seduction which is tough to own. Our unity has been destined by fate. This unison will last forever. That concludes my seminar on Sir Robert fields Nine Police Principles. Hello, how can I help you? - Good evening, sir. -Good evening. Ramarao, sir. You must have forgotten me. You had given your opinion regarding my suspension a month ago. Now, I remember. I don't recall your name. What brings you here? Nothing sir, I'm rejoining in another week. So, I thought I would pay you a respectful visit while I collect my medical reports. - Respectful visit? -Yeah, sir. Aren't you from the revenue department? You would have been apt for the police department. Why do you opine so, sir? Your eyes are searching for something. - SP sir! -Murali... - Come, come, come. -Good evening, sir. Meet Mr. Ramarao, your area officer I know him already, sir. We have met before. I would take your leave, sir. Thanks once again. He seems to be a tricky person. Yes, he is a master of deception. Really? - Yes. Keep an eye on him. I had already kept an eye on him. Now, I'll keep both my eyes on him. Mr. Ramarao! Don't give me that serious look, sir. Since you looked like a rookie, I thought of dominating you but as time went by I realized what a firebrand you are! Please, pardon my rudeness. Listen to my plea, I've understood that you have found a link between the missing person and our SP sir, and that's why you are keeping a check on him. But it took a year for me to come to the same conclusion. I too have been keeping a tab on him but I have found no leads. Moreover, you know about my department very well, sir. We can't oppose our seniors. Not only that... if he gets even a slight suspicion on me, he is ver much capable of making me disappear in thin air. His track records are a testament to this. So Mr. Ramarao, I have bits and pieces of evidence that indirectly point at him. The money hawala route to SP sir, how he managed the forest department and the police department indirectly, his travel history, I have all the details but I am not able to connect all these. Since you are very much capable of reading a man without any evidence* one minute. If you could connect this, the SP sir has his days numbered. Take it, sir. It will be very helpful. Sir, I have selfish reasons behind this. You want to find the missing people and I want the person who caused it, more importantly, the disappeared 'maal'. If you could solve this mystery, with your blessings, I would get a lifetime settlement. Sir? After you solve the case, will you inform me about the whereabouts of the 'maal'? Or will you leave me high and dry by handing over the 'maal' to the government? Sir, although I had already expressed my suspicion on SP I couldn't back it up with any document support. I have prepared a strong pre-charge evidence on SP Devanand. I'm sending that to you. I request you to set up an inquiry on him. Special enquiry? That's the only way, sir. Otherwise, he will find a way out of this. But it would be better if it feels like a general enquiry set up on all the district administrators. If that is the only option, I will talk with the CM and arrange it. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much May I come in, sir? Yeah, come in, David Sir... We have news from Hyderabad saying the amount from Koduvali hawala has been received. They have asked us to collect at Sultan Bazaar, sir. Amount? Yes sir. This year, the Tamil labourers from the Javadi hills have arrived at the forest before season. They must be having a requirement of 'maal', that's why they have sent them earlier. And they have sent us the money to deal with the forest department and check posts like usual. I know this is not the right time, the CM office has promoted the Red Sandalwood issue to a highly important matter of cognizance and ordered surveillance on our district administrators You are on the watchlist as well, sir. And, the Secretary of the CM office, Mr. Venkatesham is directly monitoring the whole process. I know. I know, David. I know. But sir, If they are taking cognizance of last year's consignment, do you think something happened last year without our knowledge? No, no. Nothing unusual happened. Last year's activity went by very smoothly. Sir, one more thing. There is a strong involvement behind this surveillance, sir. Yes. There is a super-man involved in this. Sir, just to be on the safer side, shall I ask this hawala amount to be kept on hold and send back the Tamil labourers? No, no, no. Don't do any of that. I may need to do something. unexpected. By the way, where have the labourers landed for work? Yudharala theertham. Beat point 9, sir. - Someone is coming. -Quickly, pick up the wood. Hey, come out! It is our supervisor. Come. Come. Come, have some liquor. No, I'll have it after finishing this work. Sir, no. Please don't, sir. The green Seshachalam forest has been painted red in blood. Chittoor district's SP, Devanand has shown extreme valour by gunning down the Tamil robbers who were here to steal our state's prestigious treasure, red sandalwood. Many people in Tamil Nadu have condemned this encounter. Many politicians have expressed that Andhra government... ...has offered their waters to the Tamilians with one hand ...and spilled the blood of Tamils with the other hand. Ramarao, even though the encounter of those Tamilians is unjust yet, legally, SP has those rights. Anyhow, I'll send him a show cause notice. Let us see what he says. Sir, now show-cause notice and enquiries are not enough. You are a secretary at the CM's office. Take the powers in your hand and confidentially arrest SP Devanand who has been... the sole reason for the brutal death of so many labourers. Who all are involved in his main gang, what are the remaining missing links related to him, I will connect everything and submit it to the government. Ramarao, we don't have any concrete evidence yet to arrest him. CM sir has gone to attend the Janmabhoomi inauguration ceremony in his native village. As soon as he returns, I'll speak with him and get a conclusion for this case. But until then, you must have patience. Okay? After a long time, you have faced defeat. You played better than me. Come on, let's go. Looks like I have an unexpected guest. I love your timing. You know why? Because I was planning to meet you anyway. See, you* Not bad. You are a courageous man. I am aware of all your atrocities. You are holding the law as a shield to you I am looking for one solid piece of evidence to put you behind bars... such that you would never ever see the daylight in your lifetime. Evidence? Try your luck. luck. I don't depend on luck and lotteries. I depend on my work. And by the way, the sun doesn't shine every day. And even if it does, I am as unpredictable as the weather. If you are lucky enough and I won't find any evidence against you, I would take a voluntary suspension and make you confess your crimes by thrashing the hell out of you. People who depend on their weapons have confidence in the weapons they use. But I'm a weapon personified and every cell of my body exuberates confidence. Try your luck! Dad, grandfather. Ramarao! He must have had a sudden heart stroke. Early in the morning, your mother saw him lying unconsciously on his chair. If there was anybody around him while he was having the stroke, we could have still saved him. When the heartbeats stop, it is time to lay him to rest forever. Even an infinite amount of tears would leave the soul dry. Dad... grandfather. Even an infinite amount of tears would leave the soul dry. This is the moment when you realize that all the relations are bound to snap at the end. This is the journey to unite the mortal with the immortal. The truth is, your body is a fragile glass which would shatter at a jerk of wind. Sir, I understood that you Encountered those labourers to divert the surveillance on us. In the beginning, you were celebrated as a hero in the public and the media. Even the government heaped praises on you. But all of a sudden, the same thing backfired on you, sir. People stopped looking at it from a legal perspective and started looking at it from a humanitarian perspective. As you said, whoever initiated this surveillance on you is truly a Superman, sir. I don't know what he did, but the CM who was appreciative of this encounter... has now softened his approach and called the Tamil Nadu CM to have a talk with him regarding this. Now the issue is getting very bigger, sir. Give me a minute, man. Let me think. I am already on leave. I'll leave to my regular hideout and start the damage control process by cutting off the wings of that Super-man Ramarao. You go to the CM's office and keep me posted with all the updates regarding me. Okay, sir. Brother! Yes, brother. - I want to make an ISD call. -You can use that. Dad, Grandfather. Which grandfather? Isn't he dead? Stop nagging, now! You keep going. Ramarao! Hi, how are you? I'm good. It seems after many days you have come to the market along with your family. It's been a long time. Life must move on. -Will you have some tea? Brother, two cups of tea. Brother Raghav! Hey, Kabir! How are you? It's been so long since you last met us. - Are you very busy? -Nothing like that. - How are you doing, brother? -Yeah, I'm good. Being an RMP, I have to roam around several villages. That's keeping me engaged. Even now, I have come to town only to purchase medicines. That means you are really being very busy. Brother, I got to know about father very recently but I wasn't available in the town. - Brother! -Who are you? Raghava, Kabir... take them away* Quick. Come. Come with me madam. Madam, faster. Your son will be safe. Ramarao will take care of him. Get into the vehicle. - Kabir, get into the vehicle. -Let's go, brother. I never knew that Brother Ramarao was this wild! Go... You go and you too. Who sent you? Tell me. Who sent you? Speak out. I'll tell. Please. I'll tell. - Tell me who has sent you. - Say it out... -I'll tell you everything SP forwarded this photo and sent us here. Brother, please let me go. Brother! Guys, stop. He is thrashing us although we didn't came for him. Grandfather. Sir, although I had all the evidence regarding this complicated missing case yet... I could connect all the pieces together only after the market attack. Sir, the ones who went missing in this operation 'Mayam' are... those who are all connected to Varma but hailing from different areas. They went missing in the Horsley hills area. And the ones who did that are still roaming right in front of our eyes. the most dangerous highway killers. The most important person in that gang is my brother, Ananth. And the leader of that gang is my junior from the school, Kabir, Virja is the red sandalwood smuggler who stays in Hongkong. His secret operation of transporting 450 tons of A-grade red sandalwood from the keepers at Seshachalam forest to the Mangalore port It's naturally happening like clockwork with the support of SP Devanand. But SP Devanand grew greedy over Viraj's entire consignment worth hundreds of crores. The result of which is, 'Highway Killer's Gang'. This gang, disguised as break Inspector... would ambuscade at the secret routes in government vehicles They would stop only those vehicles which were transporting red sandalwood... as Varma would have already passed them the details of these vehicles. After that, they brutally killed the drivers and cleaners in those vehicles. Since Varma was travelling behind the last container, he noticed a container driving in the opposite direction. He followed that container... And he was caught by a killer gang. What are you doing here? How can you steal the entire container? Who are you all? I saw him somewhere. He lives in the nearby village. He is not related to this work. Please, leave him. An elderly couple belonging to Karnataka lost both their sons in this heinous mass killing spree. The old father who witnessed this ran away from that place to save himself and his wife. He then started searching for the killers who killed both his sons. In the beginning, although he was terrified of the killers, the vengeance in him made him camp at Horsley hills. He killed two out of the three men whom he had identified by intoxicating them. He saw the third person, Ananth, roaming in my government vehicle. To kill him he planned to cause an accident of my vehicle. I found that old man and explained him that we were fighting the same battle, that is how I discovered the whole truth. But before I could find all this, I lost both Ananth and my father. The ones responsible for so many cold-blooded murders might be 'the highway killers' but the mastermind of all this who didn't leave behind any trace of evidence that could point at him.. is SP Devanand. These criminal scoundrels will be punished, No matter what. Even though there is no evidence, I will do that. I scared listening to what you said. There is no evidence. Your district collector Kishore claims that SP Devanand has fled out of this country. Anyway, CM has asked me to form an 'Red Sandlers Anti-Smugglers Task Force' and appoint you as squad through a special GO. Just in time, no? Now you don't have to ask anyone's permission for any of your actions. Take the charge from tomorrow itself. No, sir. I need some more time. Why Ramarao? You have almost solved the case, what else do you need the time for? What are you upto? Duty, sir. All these years, as a government officer, with due respect to our laws, I did my duty for the sake of justice but from now onwards, as an individual, as Ramarao, I will do my duty for virtue. That means... I'm going to hunt them. The real hunt has begun. Until Ramarao informed me, nobody knew that so much brutality happened in these hills. Dear God, the head of the dead bodies are falling off. Anyways, I can't admit these bodies to any government hospital without proper identification. Apart from these two bodies, which belong to the old man's sons, nobody would know any details about any other body including the killer himself, except Ramarao. One must appreciate that Ramarao solved this one year old case by persistently following it up. By the way, where is he? He is on his way, sir. He has gone to meet someone. He doesn't have meet-ups, he has only shootouts. Why have you come this way, brother? Who are you looking for? For you! Applaud guys! I thought you might find out everything but me, but you proved me wrong. Once I started targeting SP from the CM's office, to clear all the evidence against him, he hired a gang to kill you. That day, that gang's target was not me but you. I knew that the SP could go to any extreme to safeguard himself, in fact, that's how I could connect all the dots as soon as I saw your photo. By the way, brother, if you know everything about us then why did you come here alone? Didn't you know that we would kill you? I didn't come here to get killed. You killed my naive father... and your other gang members are responsible for so many innocent people's death. I waited patiently for you all to gather in one place. Did you find out about your father's death as well, brother? Before you fought with the goons that came to kill me at the market, I underestimated you and came to kill you while you were working alone at your terrace. Your father, that old man, tried to stop me. I punched him with a knuckle duster just once! I killed him with ease without spilling a drop of blood. Brother, your time is up. Enough, brother. Enough. We surrender ourselves to you. Forgive us and hand us over to the police. We have already outlived your life. Something strange is coming this way. Hello, Sir! What did you bring? Mr. Murali, I brought them along with me. Really? One, two, three... Oh! Looks like you have thrashed them up and got them safely here. - Do you know how to drive? -Yes, sir. Come here. Take this vehicle. Get these scoundrels treated with first aid. And then take them to the station and throw them into the cell. We can file the cases at our leisure. - Go... -Okay, sir. Sir, sir. It's burning, sir. Stop, stop. Go, now. - Go! Go! -Okay, sir. So you made that old man the punisher on behalf of all the families whose loved ones were killed by these scoundrels, didn't you? Super. Great work. By the way, It looks like you have finished some of them somewhere else but painted a different picture over here. You won't talk. Why would you talk? Hello, madam. Are you related to Hubli Krishnappa? Yes, sir. Son! Sorry, Malini. I should ask that to you. Sorry, for everything. Sorry, Anybody related to Surendra? The body is ready. You can take it along with you. This is so unjust. They have killed so many people! But finally, you have ended this killers' saga by terminating Kabir's gang. It's not the end. It's just the beginning. Viraj, sir. I feel very lucky to be one amongst the very few people who have seen you. Like I promised you, I have found the spot where my SP had hidden the 'maal'. I already know that two days before. I know that he has hid my 'maal' in the lake beside the Kokumoothi hills at the border of Karnataka. I also know that this case was solved by an officer named Ramarao. I also know that he has been appointed as special squad for the new formed Task Force. How do you know all of this, sir? I have planted my people everywhere. In SP's office and in CM's office as well. Then... despite having such a huge network how did the SP flee out of India? Follow me. Henceforth, you will take his place. Now that Ramarao is some squad, will he let us smuggle even one block of wood? He won't. That is why I started a war against Rama Rao after coming to India from Hong Kong. Hundreds of thousands of acres of lake and hundreds of crores worth 'maal'. Let's see who gets to it first. "He*s a Master or a Servant?" "Or the king of the Crowd." "He*s not easy to crush." "Leader of the pack." "Sincere though devious, his soul so brave and pure." "Does he obey? Does he violate? One shall never know." "Dodging the duties don't go well with him." "King of the crowd. Leader of the pack." "Gunshots of fire and the country is his mother." "And now like him no other." "He*s never never never gonna tire." "Law oppresses that tricks the crowd." "But the rich are free from it all." "For him it is equality, his nation above it all." "He*s not just a rebel. He is son of the land." "Playing with fire, who is this slick." "Dodging the duties." "He is king of the crowd." "He is the leader of the pack."
