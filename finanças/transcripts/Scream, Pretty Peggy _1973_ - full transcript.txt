It's $1.65 an hour. No, that's not what I had in mind. How about, um campus gas station, pumping gas, $2 an hour. Haven't you got anything else? I mean, man, pumping gas, it's anti-environmental. Well, there's a construction job just outside town. They need casual labor. - What are they building? - Tract houses. No, I don't think so. Well, that's about all I've got right now. I'd have to wear a hard hat. It would go just fine with your soft head. The housekeeping job, I want it. What housekeeping job? Oh, don't tell me it's gone, I'm gonna die. I just heard about it, or I would've been here much sooner. Elliott, light housekeeping, two hours a day, no cooking, own transport. Seventy-five cents an hour. - Ha! - I'll take it! You'll work for 75 cents an hour? Listen, I'm not wearing a hard hat or screwing up the environment, so what are you complaining about? The minimum wage in this state is $1.65 an hour. Listen, I'll tell you what, you keep turning down jobs at $1.65 an hour and I'll take one at .75, and let's just see who makes the most money, okay? When can I start? - They'll want to interview you first. - Okay, when? - Anytime. - I'm on my way. - Wait a minute, you don't know where it is. - Yes, I do, thank you very much, bye-bye! Yes? Good morning. I'd like to see Mr. Elliott, please. I am Mrs. Elliott. Mrs. Jeffrey Elliott? Jeffrey is my son. - What is it? - Oh. Well, it's about the housekeeping job. Yes. The housekeeping job you advertised at the college. - We did? - Yes, ma'am. Light housekeeping, two hours a day, no cooking, own transport. There must be some mistake. - Who is it, Mother? - We do not need a... It's all right, Jeffrey, I'll take care of it. I'm sorry, you've come out here for nothing. - Yes, what is it? - She's from the college. She says you advertised for a housekeeper. Oh, I did, come in. - Jeffrey, we do not need... - Mother! Mother, I'll handle it. Come on in. Well, I'd just about given up on anyone answering that ad. It's been three weeks. It's the money. Nobody works for 75 cents an hour anymore. Then why are you here? I need the job, and I have a fairly heavy schedule, so a couple of hours a day would suit me just fine. I don't mind the cooking either. - No cooking is required. - Oh, yeah, I know that, but I don't mind, I really like to cook. That won't be necessary, just light housekeeping. Yes, see, my mother is... Well, she's not completely well. The house is really too much for her. Boy, I can see that. I mean, I never even saw a house like this before. - Is it just you and your mother? - Yes, just the two of us. That's good. Well, back there is where we eat, and the kitchen is back through that door, and the study is here. Oh, this is really great. And the bedrooms are upstairs. Oh, what about that place over there above the garage? - Do I clean that too? - No, no, no. You won't have any reason to go in there. - I take care of that myself. - Okay. When do I start? Tomorrow? What about today? There's plenty of work to do. - If you like. - Should I start in the kitchen? - That's a good place. - Okay, sure. Oh, um, one more thing. Nobody works for 75 cents an hour anymore. Well, how would a dollar and a quarter be? How would $1.65 be? All right, you have your $1.65. Look, if there's anything you need, you better ask me. My mother is inclined to forget things. I'll be in my studio, which is around the side. - I'm a sculptor. - I know, I think you're terrific. Oh, wow, I'm surprised you've even heard of me. Most people haven't. I saw an exhibition that you had in New York three years ago. I never forgot it. You know, I think that that was one of the things that inspired me to study art. - You're an artist? - Well, I'm learning to be one. Yeah, I know, that's silly, you either are or you aren't. - And which are you? - Oh, I'm not sure yet. You see, I'm a fourth-year art student, and I transferred out here because I wasn't getting anyplace where I was, and your art department is supposed to be one of the best in the country. - Is it? - I don't know that yet either. I've only been here two weeks. Well, I hope everything turns out the way you want it to. Thank you. That's Jennifer. She's very beautiful, isn't she? Yes, yes, she is. Who is she? I mean, is she your son's girlfriend? Oh, no. No, no, that's Jeffrey's sister. That picture was taken some years ago, of course. Oh, this house was so much happier before she left us. Where is she now? She went to Europe, I think, yes. Yes, Europe. You shouldn't have taken this job. Why not? It's exactly what I want. There must be better jobs in town. You could work in a shop or a bookstore. And the trip out here, it's such a long way to come. I have my bicycle, I don't mind. Oh, and it's such a big house! There's no problem, really. Can I bring you anything when I come from town tomorrow? No, nothing. Well, then, I'll see you tomorrow morning. Night. Mr. Elliott? Mr. Elliott? Hi. Am I disturbing you? No, not really. I thought you might like some coffee and stuff. Oh, why, I'd like that very much. Here, let me move this off for you. Um, cream and sugar? - No, just black. - Okay. - Isn't it quitting time? - Yeah, but it's okay. Today's Saturday. No classes. Thank you. Would you like some pie? Yeah, fine, thanks. Thank you. How is it? It's good! - It's good. - You don't have to say that. - You're not gonna hurt my feelings. - No, no, really, it's very good. What is it? It's carrots and nuts and raisins, very nutritious. I'm sure of it. BOY this place is terrific. May I... may I look? Yeah, sure, go ahead. It's... it's just terrific. Oh! That has... that has such power. Are you studying sculpture in school? Yes. Well, show me your work sometime. - Really? You'd really look at it? - Really. I mean, you'd give me an honest opinion? Maybe you'd better not look at it. I mean, I'm really not sure if that's what I really want to do yet. Well, what do you really want to do? I'm not really sure yet. I know that I want to create something beautiful, and that I want people to look at it and feel good, and that I want them to say, "Peggy Johns created that." What if they look at it and feel good and they don't even know who created it? That would be fine too. Would it? No. Would you like some more pie? No, I haven't even finished this. Hey... That's your sister, isn't it? Yes, that's Jennifer. Your mother told me about her yesterday. How long has she been gone now? Three months. She was in Europe, your mother said. - Florence. - Florence. What a wonderful place. Yeah. Jennifer and I went to Florence together once. Rome too. Paris, Marrakesh. We used to travel everywhere together. Is she married now? I don't know. You don't know if your own sister is married? Well, she intended to get married, that's why she went away, to, um to meet this man. We haven't heard from her since. I gotta get back to work. Oh, wait. Could I watch? I'm only putting together an armature. Please? Well, look, it's gonna be a while before I get anything going. But if you got the time. I've got the time. You live in the dormitory? No, I share an apartment with four other girls. - Oh, that sounds like fun. - Nah, it's awful. We, um, get our clothes mixed up and we fight over the bathroom, all that kind of stuff. Well, why don't you get a place of your own? Much, much too expensive. Why don't you, uh, sit down somewhere? Okay. Wow! What do you think? What are they? I was trying to portray the ultimate in evil. I don't think I've succeeded. Well, you could've fooled me. When did you start doing this kind of stuff? A little while ago. They are really, really frightening. That was the idea. Art's only obligation is to touch people's emotions. Whatever emotions. What are they made out of? Oh, it's a new synthetic, it molds like clay. Oh, and you're making another one? Yeah, I was. I don't think I'm gonna work tonight after all. Oh, I hope that... that isn't because of me. Oh, no, no, um, it'd be better to start when it's light. Besides, I feel like taking a walk. I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow's Sunday, but I'll come anyway if you need me. No. May I call you "Jeffrey"? "Mr. Elliott" is so archaic. Jeffrey, sure, all right. You haven't been bothering Jeffrey, have you? Oh, I hope not. He let me watch him work for a few minutes. He said it was all right. He never used to eat pie. I think he liked it. I never learned to bake. I never learned to do any of those things. Have you finished for the day? Yes, but I have a little extra time. I was thinking I could do those rooms above the garage. No! You mustn't go up there, never. Didn't Jeffrey tell you? - Yes, but... - Never! Go on, run along now. Goodnight. Now you listen. I don't know who you are, but if you don't stop following me, I'm going to call the police. Excuse me, I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. Yeah, you did. - Who are you? - Oh, my name is... My name is Thornton. I was wondering if you could help me. - That depends. - You're working at the Elliott place? Yes. I wonder if you could tell me... something about the people there. - Like what? - Oh, anything, anything at all. You see, I'm... I'm looking for my daughter. I told him that any questions he wanted to ask, he should just come right here and ask them. - And? - He didn't seem to want to do that. He just got in his car and drove away after he told me where he was staying in town. Who is he? - Thornton? - Mm-hmm. He must be Agnes Thornton's father. She worked here a few months ago. Well, what happened to her? - Well, she left, she... - Oh! I fell. Mother, come on, get up. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've broken my leg. You don't have anything to worry about. She hasn't broken it, thank God. At her age, broken bones don't always mend properly. She tore a ligament, and it's sore and it's painful and she can't walk, but, uh, it's no big thing. How long before she can walk? The longer the better. Don't let her get up for at least a week. As long as there's the two of you, she shouldn't be any problem. These are mild sleeping pills. She can take them if it helps, but no more than two a night. Fine, thank you, doctor. No sweat. You shouldn't need me anymore, but if you do, just call me. I will. - Bye, I'll find my way out. - Thank you, doctor. Well, at least you know now. What, that your mother drinks? I knew that the first day. You did? Then why did you let me go on about her being forgetful and all that? Because it's none of my business. - Hey, what are you gonna do now? - Do? Yeah, how are you gonna look after her? I'll manage. But your work! You can't do anything at all if you have to run up and down these stairs every day. Look, it's not your problem. I know, but... Listen, um, I have a suggestion. How would it be if I moved in here for a couple of days? Now let me finish. If I could borrow your car, then I could drive in for my classes. That way I wouldn't miss any, and I could be here on call if she needed anything. Huh, what do you think? You'd be doing me a favor. How do you work that out? You'd be getting me out of that snake pit I live in. You see, it would work out best for everyone. But you really are a salesman. Yeah, I know. Have I sold you? - I guess so. - Oh, terrific! Hey, how about this room? It's right next to your mother's. It's fine, it's not in very good shape though. Oh, I don't care. Flowers, plants, I'm gonna change the whole room. - Listen, Peggy. - Yeah, yeah? You're only gonna be here for a little while. Oh, yeah, I know that. Can I borrow the car right now? - The... for what? - I want to get my stuff. Well, you don't believe in wasting any time, do you? I want to get it organized before you change your mind. Hey, wait a minute, before you go maybe you'd better go in and tell my mother that she has a live-in companion for a little while. - Okay. - And if she gives you any trouble, maybe feed her one of these. Yes? Well, it's nice to know that there's nothing broken, but the doctor would like you to stay off your feet for a few days, so I'm going to be staying here to take care of you. Staying here? I'm gonna move in to the room down the hall. Whose idea was this? Mine. I had to talk Jeffrey into it. I don't care what the doctor said, I can walk perfectly all right. No, no, no. I want you to leave everything to me. As a matter of fact, I'm going to get you a bell, and whenever you need it, I want you to ring it. Oh, the doctor left these. They're painkillers. Um, so if your leg gets too uncomfortable... We're very isolated out here. Is it loaded? Well, of course it's loaded. What would be the point of having a gun if it wasn't loaded? I'm going to get my things now. I'll make your dinner as soon as I get back. More coffee? Thanks. You work last night? Yeah, I was in the mood. Artists should be in the mood. - It helps. - Yeah. Something the matter? No, not really. Just curious. Who is the girl staying above the garage? I saw her last night going up there. I mean, I don't understand. If you're keeping some girlfriend up there in the quiet, that... that is certainly none of my business, but why didn't you tell me instead of treating me like a child? Telling me that you had some awful kind of secret up there, to stay away. I mean, this is a new age, you know, we're all emancipated. Okay. Say it. "You're fired." No, no. No, you're not fired. But I wouldn't blame you if you quit. Well, I'm not going to quit, so if you want to get rid of me, you're just going to have to do it yourself. What's the matter with her anyway? Creeping around in the middle of the night, staying in a room all the time. What, has she got two heads or something? It's not a girlfriend, Peggy. It's Jennifer. Jennifer? Your sister? She's hopelessly insane. It started slowly at first. She became forgetful. Vague, you know? The doctor said it was just a temporary thing, that she'd pull out of it. But she didn't. She got worse. She'd... start to wander off by herself, alone. We couldn't find her, and then she'd come back and she'd act as though nothing had happened. And then she started to break things, accidentally at first, but then in fits of rage, and all the time, she retreated further and further back into herself. I mean, she'd lock herself in her room for days at a time. She wouldn't talk to anybody. So we took her to more doctors. And this this time they admitted it wasn't temporary, that she'd never get better. They recommended that we commit her. I don't know, maybe I should've committed her, but have you ever seen those places? I mean, they can dress them up all they want on the outside, but inside, they're like prisons. They've got bars on the windows, locks on the doors, they've got guards in white coats. I couldn't do that! I couldn't do it. Well, do you think I'm wrong? Should I have committed her? I don't know. Is she... Is she happy? Within her own limitations, I think she is. She lives in a world of her own. She harms nobody. Except you. That's not true. Well, certainly she's a responsibility, but she's one I prefer to handle myself. What about your mother? Mother found her peace of mind in a bottle. She was never much of a mother anyway. For most of our lives, Jennifer and I were left on our own. Orphans. Metaphorical orphans. Well, now you know the other skeleton in the Elliott closet. Jeffrey... I'm so sorry. Yeah, well, you needn't be. I mean, it's not your problem, it's got nothing to do with you. Yeah, that's right. I just work here. Hello? Hello? Can I come in? Anybody home? Hello? Hi. I didn't mean to intrude. - Are you Mr. Elliott? - Yes. My name's Thornton, George Thornton. Well, you already know Miss Johns, I understand. Yes, how are you? - Come on in. - Thank you. - I'll fix your mother's lunch. - Thank you. Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Thornton? Oh, I, uh, I thought you could tell me where Agnes is. Well, I haven't seen her since she left. Ah. How long ago was that? Uh, three or four weeks now. I can't understand it, I sent out a check to cover her traveling expenses, and the check hasn't even been cashed. I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you. She didn't give you any idea where she might be going? No, no, she didn't. She didn't tell you she was coming to join me? No, no. As a matter of fact, you come as quite a surprise. I didn't even know Agnes had a father. Well, that's my fault, I guess. You see, we... we weren't very close. I travel a lot, sell encyclopedias, always on the road. I've, uh, neglected my family responsibilities. Then when I got this letter from Agnes, I... Letter? Yeah, she wrote and said she'd like to come and stay with me for a while. Well, I thought this would be a great chance to make it up to her. But she never showed up. Oh, well, I'm sorry. I still don't know what to tell you. She worked here for about three months. I thought she was very happy, then one day she just said she wanted to leave. Ah, just like that, she didn't give you any reason? No, no, no, and I certainly didn't want to stand in her way. Could I see where she stayed? Well, I don't know what good that would do. Well, maybe she, uh, left something, something that I could find out where she went. Uh, all right. - All right, fine, this way. - Thanks. She, uh, said in her letter... Well, said something about you, about you and her. What? Oh, she was very fond of you. Well, we were very fond of her, my mother and I. She was a very nice girl. But that she was worried about something. What? Well, she didn't say, just that she couldn't stay here any longer. Miss Johns is using this room now. If there was anything to find, I'm sure she would have found it. That room over the garage, what's that used for? Why? She said something else in her letter. Something up there was frightening her. I can't imagine what she could have been talking about. Maybe I could have a look? No-no, I'm sorry. I keep a lot of my personal things stored up there, I don't let anybody go up there. Oh, yes, of course. Well, thank you, Mr. Elliott. Well, I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I understand. If you think of anything, perhaps you'd give me a call? I'm staying over at the Riverside Motel. - Here's the card. - Yes, of course, I will. Now, why don't you go out this way? Ah. It's a very interesting place you've got here. Thank you. He didn't seem to be very happy. Now that's not my fault, I told him everything I know. I'm gonna do some work. What time would you like lunch? Whenever. Jennifer? Jennifer, I brought you some lunch. I'll put it right here. Jennifer, I'm working here. I'd like to be friends. Jennifer? What does she do about food? Who? Jennifer. Well, she has her own kitchenette up there. She does her own cooking. Oh, that's why she didn't touch that tray I brought up to her. You went up there? Well, yes, I thought it might give us a chance to make friends. You know Jeffrey, it might help, another girl. Now look, you're wasting your time. She won't see anyone? She sees me. - Only you? - Yeah. That's all. Look, Peggy, I don't want you going up there. Strange people upset her, just leave her be. How's Mother? Oh, she's fine. I let her have a drink. You said it would be alright. - Yeah, it makes her happy. - What about you? What makes you happy? Work. Just work? It's enough. Is it? It's enough. Jeffrey, is that you? Yes, Mother. Did you enjoy your dinner? Yes. Did you? She's a good cook, that girl. Better than I ever was. Mother, you were never a cook. And she's lovely. She reminds me of Agnes. What are you getting at, Mother? You know what I'm getting at. I think maybe I'll do some work. - Jeffrey? - Goodnight, Mother. You said that you would look at my work sometime. I wanted to show it to you at dinner and I didn't have the nerve. Not bad. Not bad at all. What does that mean? It means not bad. Not good either? I didn't say that. You're not being honest. Yes, I am. What do you think of it? The most important person an artist has to please is themselves. Have I done everything I set out to do? Have I said everything I wanted to say? Only the artist himself can answer those questions. - But do you like it? - Yes I do. Yeah, I like it very much. I certainly couldn't have done it. Oh, of course, you could. No, I couldn't, only you could do this. Good, bad, or indifferent, it's yours. If it pleases you, that's a success. I wanted to please you. That's unimportant. Not to me. Why am I so important? Because you're a famous sculptor. Okay, I'll tell you what I really think of it. On a scale from one to ten, I would say it is a six, maybe six and a half. But you see, I want someone to convince me that I'm wrong. I want someone to say that is a nine, maybe even a ten. You are unbelievable. Is that good or bad? Good. You know, I would have taken this job even if you had stuck with 75 cents an hour. Well, I'll remember that when you ask for a raise. I wasn't planning to ask for a raise. Thank you for coming here. And thank you for staying. I'll see you tomorrow. Jeffrey! Jeffrey? Hey. Jeffrey? Oh, there you are. What do you want? Good morning. Good morning. How long have you been up? Hours, I've been working. Inspiration in the wee small hours, huh? - Yeah, something like that. - May I see it? - No, it's not ready yet. - Oh I don't care, Jeffrey pl... No! No, uh, no, Peggy, you know how us geniuses are. Insecurity is our middle name. What did you want? Well, I need to go to school, Jeff. - I have a ten o'clock class. - So? - So the garage is locked, I need the key. - The key? Yeah, the key to the garage. You know, the car is in the garage, I need the car. Well, look, I need the car today, I've got some errands to do. Oh okay, I'll take my bike. Do you mind? No, not at all, it's a lovely day, I'll be doing my bit for ecology. Okay, your lunch is in the fridge and you've got to take your mother's up to her, okay? - Yeah, okay. - See you tonight. - Bye: Mrs. Elliott! Good morning, my dear. What are you doing out of bed? I'm going to do some things around the house. Oh no, you're not, you're going right back to bed. You get away from me. I can manage on my own. - I'm going to get your son. - No, no. No, no, no, don't. Don't, I must talk to you. Only if you go back to bed. Very well. Oh, thank you, my dear. My leg is still pretty sore. Well, it's your own fault, you shouldn't have got out of bed. Now, what did you want to talk to me about? Is Jeffrey in the studio? Yes, he's been there half the night working on something new. You must go, leave this house. - Leave? - Give up this job. Mrs. Elliott, I told you before, I like the job. I don't want to leave, I'm very happy here. Well, it's not right, a pretty young thing like you cooped up here doing housework. I am not cooped up. Jeffrey lets me have the car whenever I need it, or nearly. But you should be with people your own age! What is it, Mrs. Elliott? Why do you want me to leave? I just told you. No, um, there's something else. Is it because of Jennifer? What do you know about Jennifer? I know everything, Jeffrey told me. What did he tell you? That she's sick. She stays in her room all the time. I'd like to make friends with her. And what did he say to that suggestion? He wasn't very enthusiastic. I can imagine. But this is all nonsense, isn't it? We both know the real reason why you want to stay on here is Jeffrey. - What? - You're after my son. - I certainly am not. - Yes you are, and I won't have it. I need him, you're not going to take him away from me. Mrs. Elliott, that is very dumb. - Is it? - Yes it is. You're fired. I thought you'd gone? Your mother just fired me. She did what? She fired me. Did she give you any reason? She thinks I'm after you. Oh. Well? - Aren't you gonna ask me? - Ask you what? Do you think I'm after you too? Are you? No. My mother told me it was unladylike for the girl to chase the man. Oh, it's alright for the man to chase the girl though? Yes. Listen, don't worry about my mother, I'll speak to her. You'd better get going, you're gonna be late. I have an afternoon class, I won't be back till late. We'll survive. Riverside Motel. I'd like to speak to Mr. Thornton, please. I'm sorry, Mr. Thornton isn't here. You mean he's checked out? No, stuff is still in his room but he hasn't been back here in two days. I see. Thank you very much. Jeffrey? Jeffrey! Jeffrey? Jeffrey. Jeffrey, I must talk to you. Where's Jeffrey? I don't know, I haven't seen him all day. He's probably in his room. No, no, he isn't. Well, the studio then. If he's there he doesn't answer the door. Well, maybe he doesn't want to talk to you. Well, I want to talk to him. What about? I'll talk to Jeffrey. What do you want to talk to him about? Alright, it's about Mr. Thornton. Who? Agnes' father, he came here a few days ago asking about her. Agnes left here weeks ago. Jeffrey told him that and he left but he must have come back. Why? Because his car's in the garage. - I think... - What do you think? - I think I'll talk to Jeffrey. - Peggy, please! Leave this house now! It is Jennifer, isn't it? She's... she's dangerous. Leave this house while you still can! No, I'm not going to leave here until I know exactly what is going on. And if Jeffrey is in that studio, he cannot stay in there forever. No matter what he's doing. Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Jennifer. Jennifer, my name's Peggy. I know about you. Jeffrey told me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, where are you? Jeffrey! Please, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, oh please, I need you, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey! - Jeffrey! - Hey, hey, what is all of this? Jennifer tried to kill me. Where, what are you talking about? She attacked me in the studio just now. I thought it was you. Okay, come on, take it easy. What happened? Jennifer attacked me, she had a knife. Okay, come on, come on, take it easy. - Jeffrey, leave her alone. - Mother, go back to your room. I'll take care of it. Tell me exactly what happened? She... she just attacked me. She tried to kill me! And I think that something happened to Mr. Thornton too. Why? Because his car is in the garage. Oh, you knew that. That's why you looked it this morning. Yes, yeah, I know. Here, drink this. I came down early this morning to work. The car was parked out front. Thornton must have come back to poke around. I looked for him but I couldn't find him. Well, tell me why you hid the car? Well, I guessed that Jennifer must have hurt him in the middle of the night. Had what? There's only one way to find out. Jeffrey? - Jeffrey, be careful. - Stay here. I know how to handle her. He still doesn't know. - Know what? - It's your fault, it's all your fault. If you hadn't come here, everything would have been alright. Mrs. Elliott, you don't seem to understand. Your daughter tried to kill me back there, she attacked me with a knife. Who knows how many other people she's killed? Thornton, maybe Agnes. Jennifer? It's Jeffrey, let me in. Jenny, honey, I don't think you know what you've done. I can't let this go on anymore. You've got to understand that. Jenny, what are you doing? Jenny, put that away! Jenny, please listen to me, Jenny! Don't, ah! Jeffrey! I killed her. She tried to stab me. I tried to take the knife away from her... and she fell on it. I don't understand. Why would she do a thing like that, I... I loved her. I was the only one that really loved her. - Jeffrey, you're hurt. - Don't! No, don't! - Leave him alone! - He needs help! No, no, I don't want you going in there. - Nobody goes in there. - Jeffrey, please! Nobody goes in there. We have to call the police! - The police? - Of course we do, they have to be told! I don't want them touching her. Nobody touches her. Jeffrey, it's alright, no one would blame you. No! Mrs. Elliott, we have to! No! He killed her in self-defense, she was a violent psychotic. She tried to kill me just before. You still think that, don't you? I know. It's all over, it's finished. I think I'm glad. I kept quiet for so long because it suited me. It was comfortable. I could get drunk as often as I wanted to and... Well, he was my son and I couldn't let them put him away. They're not going to put him away. We're both going to swear that it was self-defense. Well, why don't you go and tell him that? Go and tell him right now, what difference does it make? Tell him that we will both swear that he killed his sister because she tried to kill him. Jeffrey? Jeffrey, I must talk to you. Jeffrey? Jeffrey. Jeffrey. I'm Jennifer. Jeffrey! He loved Jennifer. That's why he killed her. And put her body inside that statue. He couldn't bear the thought she was going to leave him to be married. Afterwards, half of his mind became Jennifer. It was the only way he could hold onto her. And that half of him was insanely jealous. Wouldn't allow him to show affection for anyone else. That's why he killed Agnes Thornton. The Jeffrey half of him started to fall in love with her. That's why he tried to kill you. Oh, I should have done something sooner. But I'm an old woman and I needed him. I wasn't the kind of mother I should have been. But it was my life too, and if I'd done something sooner they would have taken him away. And I would have been all alone. No one to take care of me. You understand that, don't you? Connect me with the police. Please, can I have a drink?
