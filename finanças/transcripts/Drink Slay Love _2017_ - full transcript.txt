Would you if I asked you to? Anything for you, my darling Jadrien. ( lays on horn ) ( tires screech ) Sweet Pearl. Always looking out for others. I can't help it. I just want to make the world a better place. ( laughs ) Come on, I'm hungry. Jim's Place? Really? Again? It's not me, it's my sweet tooth. Just one nibble and we can go home. Do you need me to protect you? I didn't think so. Thanks for your concern. Always, darling. Hi Brad. You know me? Name tag. Oh, right. Can I get you something? Mint chocolate chip. Anything else? You. Me? C'mon. It's no fun eating alone. Ok. Oh! You're not like other girls. You have no idea. Don't you want a bite? Well, if you're offering. ( shocked gasping ) Mmmm. Minty fresh. It's a shame you won't remember this. Something tells me it was the highlight of your night. Jadrien? Could you come back? It's too late, I had my snack already. Hey, pretty bird. Come here. I'm not gonna hurt you. I don't eat wild animals, just tame humans. Come here. Yeah, that's right. I'm a vampire. Is that a problem? ( gasps ) No! Who's there?! What have you done? I'm fine, thanks for asking. Drink this. Is that canned blood? Dad, ew. You need it. Seriously though, what happened? Please. Not the old amnesia for sympathy ploy. Blood tea, Mrs. Sange. Did you come back for me? You know I'm not the hero type. Well, then how did I get back home? Uncle Felix found you tucked under the eaves of the front porch. What's the last thing you remember? Getting staked? If you were staked you'd be dead. So tell us what really happened. Why would I lie? I was staked. They came up behind me and they- They could have missed her heart. So you were beset by a vampire hunter, you let yourself be identified and nearly slain. Your carelessness may have exposed us all. You're grounded. What?! And I don't want you hunting alone. Not until we identify the slayer. You can hunt with Jadrien or your cousin. I can take care of myself! Our family has many enemies. You're our only child. The crown jewel of generations. We can't risk you. Especially not with the ceremony coming up. What ceremony? Well, I wasn't planning on telling you but, since we're all here... We've been chosen to host the Fealty Ceremony. ( gasps ) Where? When? I need a new dress! In the wine cellars beneath Greenbridge Estate. In six weeks. And yes, Antoinette, please get a new dress. And burn the one you're wearing. The Fealty Ceremony is the most important event in a young vampire's life. To host the ceremony is the highest honour any family could hope for. And that, Pearl, is why we cannot attract the attention of hunters or allow rumours of hunters to spread. The Fealty Ceremony happens once every hundred years. It's time to shine, Pearl. Are you sure you're ok with this? You did almost die today. All the more reason to train harder. ( grunts ) So. The Fealty Ceremony. The Sange family just keeps rising. And you just keep tagging along for the ride, don't you? It's so much easier than climbing to the top by myself. And I suppose you think you're good enough to be my escort? Of course. I'll be the judge of that. Show me what you got. ( grunts ) We're destined for each other, Pearl. Your skills and connections, and my charm and ruthless ambition. We'd be unstoppable. I already am. ( grunts ) Are you sure about that? Just lulling you into a false sense of security. ( grunts ) Surrender. You surrender. To you? I surrender my heart and soul. Very romantic, considering you have neither. I cannot believe my mom is making me do this. It builds character, my darling. Though it'll take more than us to get this place ready for the ceremony. Did you hear? The king's looking for a new consort. Sounds like a thankless job. Queen of the vampires? That sounds so awesome. Hmm. My mom would have to take orders from me. What about Jadrien? He already does. ( small laugh ) He's selfish and power hungry, but he keeps me on my toes. It's like, when I'm with him I can feel the blood in my veins. Speaking of blood, I'm hungry. If my mom asks I'll be training in the dojo. You just got staked yesterday. Plus, your mom said no solo hunting. My mom says a lot of things that I don't listen to. I'm not gonna lie for you. I'll let you borrow my black motorcycle jacket. ( sighs ) Deal. Hi Brad. You- you... you know me? Name tag? ( doorbell rings ) You can't kill Wolverine, he's immortal. Wrong. In Death of Wolverine, a virus from the microverse turns off his mutant healing factor and he suffocated by adamantium. So there. Excuse me. Uh, for pick up, right? Yeah. Can I get you something? Uh, a small mint chocolate chip. Yeah, sure. Is there a problem? No. Did you see that? She had no reflection! That ice cream would taste a lot better if you shared it with me. What? You, me, out back. Now. Just making sure we're alone. You haven't seen, like, a white falcon around here, have you? No. An albino pigeon? Any white bird? I should probably get back to work. No. You haven't tried my ice cream yet. Something feels off. Maybe you're lactose intolerant? ( gasps ) Now! Time to burn, vampire. Who's got the problem now? You do. Shoot her! Dude, let's get out of here! No! The sun! Dude! She's so fast! ( screeching tires ) I'm alive. Are you ok? Are you in trouble? I'm alive! Yeah, I can see that. What makes you think that I'm in trouble? Do I look like trouble? Have you seen yourself in a mirror recently? As a matter of fact, I have. And I look hot. I guess, I mean, if you're in to the whole zombie hooker look. Excuse me, that is so offensive. I don't look like a zombie. I'm heading into town. Can I give you a lift? Sure. I could use a ride. What're you doing? Don't worry, I'll leave it somewhere safe. What the hell just happened? ( screeching tires ) ( sighs ) Daytime driving sucks. Coffee. Cellphones. Yoga. This is what I've been missing out on all this time? Humans are useless. Pearl, it's nearly dawn. Why aren't you in the catacombs? I must have fallen asleep. You missed lessons. Jadrien and Antoinette said you didn't hunt with them. Did you go hunting by yourself again? I have to show you something. What are you doing? What's going on? Are you trying to kill yourself? I spent all day yesterday in the light. Our vulnerability to the sun is a myth. Please, step back. It could be a one-day miracle. My sweet rose- Step back, now! Oh my gosh! We can face the sun! ( screams ) ( whimpers ) Take her downstairs, and speak of this to no one! No one! Everyone out! Out! Get an ice bucket! Except you. And one for yourself. Oh, I'm not really uh- Do it. Watch yourself, Pearl. I don't know where this new ability of yours comes from but as long as it exists I'm going to use it. How? We need to supply a feast for the king at the Fealty Ceremony. Finding dozens of humans in our current hunting grounds is problematic at best and extremely risky at worst. So you want me to hunt in the day? Precisely. When you attend high school. ( glass shatters ) ( dub step music playing ) This is so exciting. This is so unfair. I don't want to go to high school. Being locked up all day with a bunch of whiney humans? Now I really wanna kill myself. If you die can I have Jadrien? No. It was worth a shot. Ok, so what am I wearing? I still can't believe that you asked me to help. You never ask me to help. I'm asking you for one standard high school outfit. And please forget your obsession with the 80's. It depends on what clique you want to join. You can be a nerd, a jock, a weirdo, a mean girl, or a rebel. Those are my choices? If you wanna fit in you're gonna have to tone it down. I don't want to fit in. Do you know what humans do all day? Drink coffee, practice yoga and stare at their phones. That's it. This could be huge for you. When the king finds out that you supplied the feast he's totally gonna want you as his queen. Why would I want that? Why not? Power, baby. Hmm. Queen Pearl. I guess I like the sound of that. I wish I was the one going to high school. Me too. Ah. Here we go. Hoodies cross all clique lines. Are you sure you don't wanna borrow some shoes? If I had a soul it would look like these boots. Fine. Now listen. According to all the teen movies the most important thing is to be yourself. I thought the most important thing was to fit in. By being yourself. How do I fit in with a bunch of humans by being a vampire? You're the crown jewel. Figure it out. I was just coming to find you. How are you feeling about tomorrow? I'm not nervous. Definitely not nervous. Why would I be nervous? We've only got six weeks so you have to ingratiate yourself to the community quickly. Get yourself invited into as many homes as you can. I'm not the only source for the king's feast, am I? You've got a back-up plan, right? We're counting on you, Pearl. Don't let me down. I won't. I promise. ( kids chatting ) Antoinette was right. Nerds, jocks, burnouts... Pearl! How do you know my name? I'm- I'm on the welcome committee. I'm Bethany, your student guide. Your file didn't have a photo but I just knew it was you. I mean, we don't really get that many new kids around here. Hey Bethany. Hey. What're you doing here? I go here now. Do you guys know each other? She's the one who stole my car. I returned it. Parking it in a tow zone. Which I'm sure was not on purpose. I mean, everyone deserves a second chance, right Evan? He's not a morning person. That makes two of us. Just wait, you're gonna love it here. Everyone is super nice and super awesome. You parked in my spot. Sorry, Ashlyn. You don't own the parking lot. Hey Evan, when you want a lift out of Loserville let me know. Are you the queen bee or the mean girl? I forgot the difference. Don't mess with me, new girl. I'm all sting and no honey. Nice boots. Freak. She blocked me in. ( glass shatters ) ( car alarm wails ) Uh, thank you? Here's your class schedule and a list of clubs and teams you can join, and a map of the school. You're supposed to have a student guide. Oh, there you are. I thought I lost you. You're, like, really fast. Clearly not fast enough. It says here you've been home schooled your whole life. Your mother must be some kind of angel. Angel of darkness. If you have any questions or if anyone's bothering you just let me know. Don't worry about Pearl, I'm gonna take good care of her. She's bothering me. Welcome to contemporary art lab. Would you like to introduce yourself? No. Final projects are due in two months. You'll have to catch up on your own. She can borrow my notes. You want to sit? Lovely. Then I can grade two art projects full of sunshine and daisies. Oh, I won't need her notes. From the looks of you I'm guessing you wouldn't have taught anything I don't already know. Excuse me? You've got a framed picture of Andy Warhol on your desk next to, oh my gosh, an apple. You're just a grumpy art teacher who's still bitter about his painting that didn't win a blue ribbon at the county fair. I'm sure your artistic teachings are equally original. That was fast. Question: how many days 'til graduation? An eternity, if you spend it in the office with me. ( heavy music plays ) ♪♪ You wrecked my car. What? You wrecked my car. Yes, I did. And I'll gladly pay for the damages. Yes, you will. How about I send my parents over with a cheque? What's your address? 150 Mount Grey Road. Splendid. Are we done? I can't tell if you're stupid or crazy. ( laughing ) Or both. ♪♪ Um, dude? It's her. You're in my light. You're the new girl everybody's been talking about. And you're the two idiots who tried to kill me. Yeah. Sorry. We thought you were a vampire. We play a lot of video games. I would have never guessed. So clearly that whole thing was our bad. So vampires. Is that like a thing here? There is more to Greenbridge than meets the eye. We can tell you who's safe and who's suspect. Suspect. Suspect. Yeah, suspect. What about those two? Keep an eye on the girl. No one human can be that perky. Or cute. Hi Bethany. What's up? Falcon... Hi. Hi. So I noticed your shirt earlier. The one with the falcon on it? Oh yeah, you should get one. Now that you're one of us. One of us? Yeah, the Falcons. Oh, your mascot is a falcon. For a second I thought you were... What? Nothing. Coach hates it when we have hair in our faces. Thanks. Any enemy of Ashlyn's is a friend of mine. ( coach ) Start running, I'm timing you! I thought they were friends? Oh yeah, they are best friends. They also hate each other. That makes no sense. Yeah, well, keep your friends close and your enemies closer, I guess. Not that you have to worry about enemies. I mean, you're like a unicorn. A unicorn? Yeah. You just compared me to a defective horse who sweats glitter and poops rainbows? No, I just mean you're like, um... you're like, a unique and rare creature, you know? I mean, does anything even scare you? ( falcon screeching ) No. You can't cut gym on your first day! Ok. Come here, birdie. Where are you? Where are you, birdie? I'm not gonna hurt you. Much. Pearl? Ow! Evan. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? This is my house. What are you doing sleeping on my dock? I was sleeping? In broad daylight? Yeah. What is happening to me? I'm guessing you either have to lower or up your dosage. Hey, I am not on drugs. So far you've stolen my car, vandalized another one, ditched school, and now you're trespassing. Forgive me if I don't trust you. I never asked for your trust. What're you running from? I'm not running from anything. Maybe I'm chasing something. Ok. I hope I'm not giving you the wrong impression. I'm not hitting on you. Why not? No offense, you're not really my type. Well, that's too bad. You have a nice ass. ( horn honks ) What the hell? It's my parents. I'm not supposed to have people over when they're not home. ( inaudible chatter ) They don't look that scary. They've adopted six kids from foster care and raised us all on social worker's hours. Those are some steel-toed Birkenstocks on their feet. Those are your siblings? Half of them. They look interesting. I should introduce myself. No! Evan! You home? You should go. Nah, I think I'll stay. Pearl, I'm not kidding. Evan! Where are you? Come on, Evan. This car's not gonna unload itself. I'll be right there. Your first course. Ashlyn's parents will be expecting you. And a cheque to cover some minor car damage. That's it? You're not gonna ask me how my first day of school was? I have a ceremony to plan for over 100 vampires including the king. I don't have time for your ramblings. Or your attitude. I wasn't- You have one job. Get us invited into human homes so we can feast from them and feed the king. Do you understand? Yes, mother... Whatever. I'm not your father! Unless it benefits the family I don't care about what you think or how your day was. Yes! Boo! What the hell? I saw you sneak in here. I thought you might be cheating on me. Really? Of course not. Why would anyone cheat on me? I'm gorgeous. I didn't get to feed all day at school. I didn't think I could make it through Minerva's etiquette class on an empty stomach. I missed you. Maybe you can take me out for some ice cream later? Hmm. You might wanna shower before class, darling. You reek of humans. At the Fealty Ceremony you will be presented to the king, and after he has drunk from each of you he will fill a goblet with his blood, and once you and the other vampires at the feast have drunk from that goblet you will be bound to him and he to you. The king is a cruel and sadistic ruler. He does not tolerate mistakes or tardiness! I- I apologize for my tardiness. What do you think? Does Pearl deserve a second chance? ( All ): No. That's what I thought. Kneel. ( whipping ) ( student chatter ) Back off, people. Give the lady some space. What's going on? Seems like the new girl has made quite an impression. What's up, Bethany? You smell pretty. I noticed you didn't have a notebook and... and I just wanted to say thank you for standing up for me with Ashlyn. And Mr. Beairsto. Yeah, well, I didn't do it for you. Oh, yes you did. You act all tough but I know you have a good heart. ( laughs ) What's so funny? Bethany just said that I have a good heart. That's funny. You're funny. I might just have to keep you. What about me? I'm funny. Yeah, funny looking. Dude, I'm unconventionally handsome. Which is just a nice way of saying conventionally ugly. Ok, I'll keep all of you. Ok. Even you, Evan. All I ask is that you invite me over for dinner sometime. My parents don't like to cook. Sure. ( school bell ) Uh, ok. Well, we better get to gym. You're not that funny. I see you met my parents. What? My parents? They came by with a cheque yesterday? Oh, right. I'm sorry. For what? For... nothing. I... I have nothing to be sorry about. I need to go to the nurse. Oh, poor thing. You know, she was puking in the bathroom all morning. If it's an eating disorder it's not working. I mean, those shorts are looking a little tight. ( giggles ) Well, that was fast. Yeah. Kill or be killed. Was it not like that at your old school? I was home schooled. How's high school? Fine. ( grunts ) I loved your presentation on the graffiti artist, Banksy. Never doubt your art. Oh, well that didn't work out so well for him. I'm having a sleepover next Saturday. You should come. To your house? I'd love to. The night of the Fealty is drawing near. The ceremony is in two weeks. Two weeks! Before you know it you will be kneeling before the king. Try not to disgrace yourself in the meantime. You coming to the party? No, I'm too tired. Come on, come and play with us. I never get to see you anymore. I know, I've just been so busy. Supplying the king's feast is a lot harder than I thought. Be careful, Pearl. You're starting to sound like those whiny humans you hate. You guys coming? Have fun at school. Hello my sweet rose. Hey, dad. I've been so busy with the ceremony I haven't had time to ask you about how school is going. Tell me about your experiences. No vampire has seen what you've seen. They like to talk. Their loyalty seems to shift a bit but... they're funnier than I thought they'd be. They're the enemy, Pearl. Never forget that. I haven't. I know who and what I am. Good. Keep hold of that. You haven't reported in recently. Not much to report. I've been laying the groundwork, gaining trust. This is a complex hunt. I hate to pressure you, sweetheart. Your performance... you've only gotten us access to one family so far. That's not going to be enough for the feast. We need more addresses. I- I know, it's just- it's harder than I thought. Finding the right victims. Uncle Felix tells me you've been raiding the stored blood. You're not even feeding yourself. You must do better. The king. What happened to you? If he sees the benefits he will accept you. Perhaps even choose you for his queen. And if he doesn't see the benefit? You've heard the stories, I'm sure. Not even I can protect you from his wrath. Speaking of protection, have we found out anything about this slayer? It's possible it wasn't a slayer. We think it might have been another vampire. What? Humans are not the only ones who fear us. Our family is powerful and many vampires would love to take us down. You must stay strong. We need you now more than ever. Have you ever considered yoga? I hear it's good for anger management. You have no idea what I'm going through. With my parents, the pressure that I'm under? My boyfriend? You have a boyfriend? You don't know anything about me! Everything was fine before... Before what? I don't belong here. Wait, Pearl... Don't touch me. I swear, I'm gonna bite the next person that I see. Pearl, hey. Are you ok? Why are you looking at me like that? I need to talk to you. Yeah, ok. Come here. Pearl? Where are we going? It's getting dark. Why are you taking me here? It's dark and creepy. Is this about Evan? What? Because you know that we're just friends, right? Actually, more than friends. No, he's like a brother to me, still. No, just friends. No benefits. Except the AP History is a definite plus- Just stop talking. Stop. Close your mouth. Pearl... I- I'm not gonna kiss you! I'm not gay. Well, neither am I. But I mean, you were holding my face and all the girls are doing it, and... I mean... ( laughs ) You were holding my face! ( laughing ) I was. That's weird. I guess I'm a weirdo. Yeah, you are. It must be nice. What? Being you. Living a normal, happy life. My life isn't normal. Or happy. Little Miss Sunshine? What deep, dark secrets are you hiding? It's not something I really like to talk about. When I was in preschool my parents used to forget to pick me up. They were always forgetting about me. Anyway, one day this man shows up and says that they had sent him to get me. And I recognized him. I had seen him around the house, so I went with him. He called me his sweet rose. We walked home through the woods and, well, he hurt me, and one of the preschool moms, Evan's mom actually, happened to be walking by and rescued me. That's why Evan and I are so close. His parents practically raised me. I'm so sorry. You're not the one that hurt me. You don't have anything to be sorry for. Thanks for picking us up, Evan. Pearl, wait! Aren't you going to introduce me to your little friend, Pearl? What're you doing here? Well, you said you missed me, so I thought it would be nice if we could get dinner together. A bit plain for my taste but if this is what's on the menu... Hey, what's going on? You're gonna ruin everything! Not everything. Just this thing. I am not a thing. You must be Pearl's boyfriend. And you are...? Not afraid of you. That's funny. Very funny. ( groans ) She can handle him. We can't just leave her. Let's go. What's happening, Pearl? Nothing's happening, I'm just on a complicated hunt which you just totally jeopardized! Bull....! I've seen you hunt. You're relentless. You're spontaneous. You're... you're unstoppable. Now you're... I miss you, Pearl. You haven't been the same since the night at Jim's Place. Yes I am. Prove it. Prove to me that you're still you. That we're still us. Please. Please, Pearl. Just like old times. Hey, Brad. Do you know me? Name tag. I mean, I remember your name tag from the last time I was here. I remember you now. Those guys, they came in and they were- Nothing I couldn't handle. You look different. Before you were hot. Now you're beautiful. Thanks. Uh, I bet you say that to all the girls. Girls don't usually pay attention to me. You're a really nice guy. Some lucky girl is gonna figure that out. Are you some sort of angel? ( sharp whistle ) Actually, no. I'm the complete opposite. Shut up and stay still. Don't look at me. Damn you! What're you doing? Bite him! No! What do you mean, no? You're vampires? Stop telling me what to do! I don't owe you anything! Or my parents, or the king. The- the king? Is- is Elvis a vampire, too? Shut up, Brad. I'm trying to save your life here. Did you hear what you just said? You're trying to save the life of a human? You're obviously sick. I'm taking you home. You don't get it! Just because they don't remember it doesn't mean they don't feel it. Our bites ruin the- Who cares?! I want to ruin them because we are vampires and that is what we do! ( moans ) Bite him. Bleed him dry. It's not my blood. Come in. Did he hurt you? I made a mistake. I... I couldn't stop myself. I... this was the only place I could think of that made me feel safe. Can I stay here? Just for tonight? Of course. Here. You left me with Jadrien even though you knew he was dangerous. Well, you said you were ok. I trust you. Yeah, well, you probably shouldn't, but thank you. So prom. Is it everything the movies make it out to be? 300 hot-blooded students in heels and tuxes, trapped in a room together, slow dancing to Justin Bieber? Yeah, it's super fun. ( laughs ) You should come. With me. Are you asking me to prom? I look really good in a tux. I'm afraid I have other plans that evening. A family thing. Something's wrong with me. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lost. Sometimes you have to lose your way to find yourself. Did you read that in a fortune cookie? Bumper sticker. What if there is no right choice? Then make the left one. We're counting on you. A vampire with a conscience. So not what I wanted to be when I grew up. 300 hot-blooded students in heels and tuxes, trapped in a room together, slow dancing to Justin Bieber. What is this? It's my apology. You protected a human. Three humans. You bit Jadrien. And you nearly emptied the stored blood supply. And you got human stink all over my favourite sweater. The feast is in less than two weeks and you've brought us nothing. I didn't ask for this! You were the ones who made me go to school. I should be living it up, enjoying the last few days of my vampire childhood, not worrying about how I'm gonna single-handedly feed the whole vampire kingdom. You're right. Maybe it was too much to ask. But your behaviour is unacceptable. You're right. I'm sorry. 300 students equals 300 pints. Let the school borrow the estate above the wine cellar for the dance and lock the doors. Maybe we can take a pint from everyone. That way no one gets sick. No one will remember a thing. It's done. What happened to you last night? Are you ok? When you weren't there this morning I called her. I thought maybe you had gone to her house or something. Well, thank you both for your concern, but I'm fine. I went home. I made the left choice. All fixed. It's not all fixed. All fixed. Ok, why are you hanging up prom flyers? Because I joined the prom committee. I thought you were busy that night. Change of plans. We're going. How do you know I don't already have a date? I don't. Pick me up at 8:00. Woah, nice work on prom. Greenbridge Estate. My dad owns it. The gymnasium is cool and all, but if I'm gonna do this whole teenybopper thing I'm gonna need to make some changes. Bethany... would you do us the honour? You're both asking me to prom? Otherwise we'd have to duel. To the death. Or until Zeke starts crying. An ugly cry. Ok, ok. Yeah, yeah. I'll go to the prom with you. Cool. Great. This was a bad idea, wasn't it? ( together ) Yes. Thanks for all your help on the prom. I'm surprised that you even care. Yeah, well, caring about school things is kind of new to me. Prom isn't school. Oh, Bethany. Come here. So, ladies, Bethany has a problem. I do? She has two dates to the prom but no dress. Anyone down for a shopping trip? Seriously? I would love to. ♪ Cool. ♪ Did you go shopping without me? I did. And I bought a prom dress. When the king sees you in this he is totally gonna choose you as his consort. Yeah, I don't know about that whole consort thing. I mean, I know he's our king and everything but he kinda sounds like a douche-bag. Is it as much fun as I thought it would be? Being human? I'm not a human. You know what I mean. Sometimes. Sometimes it is. ( hammering ) Wow. Mother is really going all out on the security. We can't have any students escape. I can't wait for the feast. High school boys are so tasty. Pearl, I'm proud of you for pulling all this together. Thank you, mother. But I was thinking about something. There are a few students that could be really helpful in terms of making Greenbridge High a long-term hunting ground. Would it be possible to spare a few of them? I'm afraid not. The king has changed the plan. He wants a blood bath. Everyone will be drained, then we'll burn down the estate to cover it up. It will be a true feast. All thanks to you. Blood bath. All thanks to you. What? Prom is gonna be awesome, thanks to you. Yeah, I think the whole school's going. No. We have to cancel prom. We have to cancel prom! There are going to be vampires hiding in the cellar waiting to kill you. ( laughing ) I'm not joking. Here, I'll show you. We need to talk. Please don't fight me. And keep your fangs in. Yeah, I know who you are. ( clears throat ) Vampires, yeah, guys, new prom theme! Whoo! Where are you taking me? It's time for you to know who I am. Excuse me? ( falcon screeches ) You. You're the slayer. ( falcon screeches ) I'm not a slayer. The rest of my family, they're slayers. I'm the healer. What does that mean? What are you doing? Evan! Just wait. I don't know what I am, or where I came from, but I know why I'm here. I can help you. You're the reason I can walk in the sunlight. And- and I have a reflection. You're the reason that I have a- Conscience. Yes. You. Do you have any idea what you've done?! You changed me! You ruined my whole family! My whole life! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Are you really? No. Why me? I've been watching you. You're so confident. Like nothing can stop you. I thought if I can change you I can change anyone. And he thought you were hot. I take it you're in on this circle of worms secret. Evan's the one who healed me when... When my dad bit you. Yeah. But god, when Evan- when Evan heals, people are animals. They're always a bit better. Gooder. That's not a word. Well, it should be. We thought what if I healed a vampire? What would happen? So I'm your guinea pig? No, no, no. We- we never thought of you like that. You are a new species. Of one. Until the Fealty Ceremony. You know about the Fealty Ceremony? My family's been hunting vampires for generations. We know a lot. The blood exchange. Exactly. You are like a carrier now. And when the king drinks your blood- And then everyone drinks from him... All the vampires will be infected. Cured. I prefer the term "enlightened". Ok, well, there's just one problem. Prom. Ok, so it'll take a while for the enlightenment to take effect. The vampires will still want a feast. What happens if we just cancel prom? The king will cancel the ceremony and my family will kill me. Literally. They're gonna stake me and you won't be there to heal me. There has to be a way to go through the ceremony and still keep everyone safe. What about your family? Would they help? They would. If they knew about you. Which they don't. You are so grounded. You invited a vampire into our house? She's not like other vampires. Does she drink blood? She slept next to me last night and didn't bite me. She slept in your room all night?! Yeah, you probably should have left that detail out. I haven't bitten anyone since he healed me. Well, except for another vampire, but he totally deserved it. Look, I- I understand why you're upset. I was upset when I found out. I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask for feelings or friends. My life was good. But now it's better. Gooder. You know that's not a real word. Well... it should be. Looks like we'll be chaperoning the prom. I thought my family was scary. You should see them fight over the shower in the morning. Ok, focus! People, we have two days. The future of the universe depends on us. We're vampires, not aliens. Ok, at sundown the students will arrive upstairs for the prom. The vampires through the tunnels and in the wine cellar for the Fealty Ceremony. How much time do we have between the blood exchange and the feast? About an hour. There's a lot of dancing first. Vampires like to tango. There are two sets of stairs leading from the cellar up to the ballroom. We'll need guards stationed throughout. Marcus and Alan, you take the front entrance. William and Steve, the hall. Remember to keep your weapons loaded and be ready to fight. Sherry and Tina, you'll patrol the grounds. Make sure none of the students sneak out. We can't afford to leave anybody behind during the evacuation. All we have to do is hold the entrances until the evacuation is complete. What about the tunnels? What if some of the vampires escape through those and then double back? The nearest entrance is five miles away. Once we- or they realize that something's wrong with the feast, a few might try. So we complete the evacuation before they notice. Zero casualties on either side. What about all the students? You think they're just gonna willingly leave their prom? Peer pressure is a powerful thing. Get a few influential students, create a reason to leave and the rest will follow. Absolutely not. No, we cannot trust students- You trust students. Well, yes, but they are all trained slayers. Your classmates have no knowledge of vampires. Have you turned on the TV in the last five years? I mean, there's Twilight, True Blood, Vampire Diaries. She's right. There's a whole section at Barnes & Nobel dedicated to teen vampire romances. Everyone knows about vampires. It's not gonna be easy. Some people might not believe us. There's gonna be a lot of people that are scared. But it's our best shot. Ok. I knew it! This is so cool! Aren't any of you scared? Or shocked? Well, I would be if I believed you. Show them your fangs. ( screams ) I'm not gonna hurt you. She's a good vampire now. Wait... Ashlyn, you- Yes. My parents have been feeding on her. But that's why I need your help. There's about 100 vampires waiting to chomp down on everyone at prom. We need to evacuate the prom before that happens. If you lead the way everyone will follow. Yeah, just tell them that there's, like, a gas leak or something. Or- or you can tell them that Drake is, like, performing a secret show at one of the after parties. Just... seriously, anything to get them out of the prom and into the after parties. Vampires aren't allowed into homes unless they're invited. Good to know. It's either that or we cancel the prom. No! So, does that mean you're in? Dude, this is like our dream. This will make the world a better place. Screw the world. No one messes with my prom. You know, most people the morning of their proms go get pedicures. I thought all we had to do was hold the two cellar doors? Well, this is in case some get through. Once the students have made their way across the parking lot we can connect the gas pipes, light the fire, and that'll keep the vampires contained. We're putting buckets of holy water above every entrance. Nice work. And we've got this. Crossbow. Good work, boys. My mom said we can get ready at my place. Oh, I should probably go home first. Oh, uh, actually your stuff is all in my car. I need your- your help with my make-up. And your hair. And my bow tie. You don't trust me. Bingo. Like I said, no one, and I mean no one, is messing with my prom. Wait 'til you see her. She looks amazing. Pearl! Oh no.

If you ever needed to. Your venom doesn't affect me. Your smile on the other hand... I'm coming to the cellars with you. No. You shouldn't have to do this on your own. Are you still trying to save me? Yes. But Evan, you already have. Do you mean that? No. You messed up my life in a high-handed alpha male way and changed me to fit your ideals with no regard for my needs. Then why are you still going through with it? I always thought that humans were so weak, but ever since I grew this damn conscience I've never felt stronger. ( door closes ) Jadrien. Can I cut in? She's with me. It's ok. Aren't you yummy looking? No wonder Pearl likes high school so much. Down, girl. Come on. Evan, let's go dance. Ok, let's party! C'mon guys, do some... You're looking gorgeous as ever. I thought you weren't speaking to me. I decided to forgive you. We all make mistakes. My only mistake was thinking you were good enough for me. Your mother wants you downstairs. Now. ( crowd murmuring ) Where have you been? And why on earth are you wearing those boots? I had some prom business to attend to. She looks lovely. You honour us with your hunt. Tonight will be a triumph. A night to remember. Never fear, we rescued her. You sent them to check on me? We wanted to make sure you weren't late. Forgive us. It was our last chance to parent you. Our jewel, grown at last. You will shine the brightest of all. It has been an honour to be your daughter. I'll never forget your teachings. ( horn plays ) It's the king! He's here! In the flesh. All rise for the king. Mmm. Your majesty. You honour us with your presence. Welcome to your feast. It is I who am honoured. And enchanted. I'm looking forward to my dessert. Queen Pearl. How do you like the sound of that? Sorry to burst your bubble but I will never marry that. You will if I say you will. We've got one hour. Tell them whatever you need in order to get them out of here safely. It's gonna work. It has to. I am your master, your lord, your universe. You will all answer the king.

What do you mean? I saw your reflection! ( crowd gasps ) What? In the goblet. Quiet! Explain yourself. Forgive me, your majesty. Repeat what you said. She has a reflection. I saw it in the goblet. I drank your blood tonight. Yes. Child, have you seen the sun rise? I have. ( crowd gasps ) And it was beautiful. ( crowd gasps ) She is a miracle. She will bring honour and power to you.

Ashlyn's house is just down the street! But you said vampires have to be invited in! Get in! I promise I'm not gonna hurt you, just invite me inside, please. Oh, I don't think so. Poor Pearl. So much for living together in the light. ( fighting grunts ) Do you know how grateful the king will be once I return with your corpse? ( fighting grunts ) I won't need your family's power anymore. I'll have my own. ( fighting grunts ) It's too bad, really. We were good together. We were just alike. I can't wait for you to feel it. What? Sunshine. You drank the king's blood. You drank my blood. You're gonna be just like me. ( fighting grunts ) Stop! Please. Why do you care about these humans? You'll never fit in. I already do. They knew that I was a vampire and they still wanted to help me. It doesn't have to be us against them. Please, Antoinette, you're my family. I don't wanna lose you. You always get what you want. ( fighting grunts ) Are you ok? Can you move? Get ready.
