Iraq. October 2014. The first rainstorm since ISIS fighters captured large areas of Syria and Iraq. There's fighting 30 km from my hotel. The Americans are bombing again. An Austrian invention has brought me here. The object is prized worldwide, even revered as a cult object. Here in Iraq, too. In Austria, however, little is known about it. The death trade takes place behind closed doors. Yeah, for those who never used Glocks, it's just a pistol. For me, it's something very unique. It's special. Those who use Glocks, they know what Glock means. One of the favorites. They never stop, they never get rusty. They never stop, they never... you know, fail you down. Yeah, on a daily basis, you deal with this piece, you become a friend that you cannot give up. Like me and you now. We just met today. Maybe if we, you know, meet again, like, a few more times, we become friends. This is what it is with me and this Glock here. Yeah. It's been about an hour since we met today. It's the same thing with this. The longer you use it, the longer you stay with it, the more attracted you will be with this piece. The weapon of choice was that favorite gun of drug traffickers and others bent on mass violence... ...he's a gangster. In my true honest words, karma is a bitch. It will cost you your life, eventually. It's like the mafia. You can join, but it's a capital offense to leave. I felt compelled to call you all together here now. Number one, our right of speech and religion, then, number two, our right to bear arms. A nine-millimeter Glock semi-automatic pistol. Whatever you do when trying to establish a gun connection, never be too direct. Stop violence! Stop violence! Increase peace! Stop violence! There's power in the name of Jesus. It swept the military and law enforcement worlds in 1984, after it was first introduced by an Austrian firm previously known for cutlery. The factory and the gun are both called Glock. Then, when we'll reassemble it, we'll put the barrel back in, make sure it's flat in there. You gotta take the spring, you're gonna push the spring in a little bit, make sure it's parallel with the slide. Then, you're gonna take the slide and put it on the lower frame, starting at the front, all the way to the back, pull straight back. And that is your reassembly of the Glock firearm. We're a small store in... located in Pennsylvania. And Glock happens to be one of our major sellers. Why is that so? 'Cause of their ease of disassembly and how reliable they are. They're one of the most reliable, easiest to use, firearms in the world. Next to the AK-47. They're one of the best. We have the subcompact, the compact, the full-size, and then the competition models. And also, the .45 models. We... We have… -Show him the single-stack. -We offer… different sizes of each in the .45s, which are… even a different... frame size. That's a single stack, which is a narrower frame. That's a Glock 36. It's a .45 caliber. And what makes the Glock so popular in the United States? Law enforcement use Glock. They carry… Most law enforcement departments... Our Pennsylvania State Police carry the Glock. That is their duty weapon. It's a dependable weapon. When you pull the trigger, gun is gonna go off. And you two... -went to Austria? -Yes. We were one of three people that were invited. Us being a dealer. One being a wholesaler that would sell us the weapons. And also a customer that we would sell weapons to. We are from all different parts of the country. And we were each allowed to take one person with us to Austria to go visit the Glock factory. It was amazing how fast that they could make the barrel and the slide, and... The machine, they put them in, and the machine made 'em and then it just took 'em out and it cooled them… Everything was all mechanical, but there was a lot of workers there. Glock employed a lot of people in their factory. And everybody that we talked to there seemed to like working there. Which was really nice. And I love the mountains up there. The mountains were really neat. Ferlach, Kärnten. Home to Austrian largest weapon factory. This is Glock's second plant, beside the first one in Deutsch-Wagram. A call for tenders by the Austrian armed forces prompted the engineer Gaston Glock, in the early 1980s, to develop the perfect pistol. Despite little experience in manufacturing firearms, Glock ended up revolutionizing gun technology. His pistol turned a small family business into a global player in the arms industry, and its inventor into one of Austria's richest men. But the company would have never become a global brand without the USA and its gun culture. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! This is the world-famous Hood Life & Hip Hop Tour that takes you down through South Central, Compton, Watts, all the wonderful areas that you might have seen in videos, seen in movies such as Menace II Society, Boyz n the Hood, Training Day, Baby Boy. We take you there, because some of these places are known for being extremely dangerous and extremely volatile. And if all the good people from around the world, if they make it down there, they might not fucking make it out. Glock, Glock, Glock All get shot Glock, Glock, Glock All get shot Man, I'm fucking starving. Goddamn. I don't think anything has had as big an impact on the brand name awareness of Glock in popular culture like hip hop. Like rap music. The brands change... a lot in hip hop. It's a very brand-conscious culture. Clothing brands change over time. Car companies stay the same. So, Mercedes has always been popular in hip hop. Glock's always been popular in hip hop. Over the last 25 years, the references to the product, to the name Glock, are in the thousands. And there are songs named directly after the Glock. There're dozens of those songs and... Every day... I'm a hip hop fan. I listen to new rap music, new hip hop. And every day, there is a song that comes out where the Glock gets profiled. And that's a reflection of the fact that the artists live a certain type of life style coming up, where... it's necessary, or they believe it's necessary to arm themselves, to pack. So, they end up packing Glock. Never leave home Without it Good thing We brought the Glock Cuz I put away a shotgun Borrow me a Glock It's a form of art, which... is based on rhyming. So, Glock rhymes with a lot of cool words: "lock," "pop," "drop," "cock"... You know, all that stuff works in ta... in combination with the name Glock. And there's just something powerful about that name. There's certainly one functional reason why Glocks are very, very popular. Because I've been in shootouts. I've had the unfortunate incident where I had a weapon that jammed. It is known by every gang member, every bank robber... anybody that's hustlin' down here in the hood that your Glock will never fuckin' jam on you. And that may save your life. Keep my shit cocked Cause the cops got a Glock, too What the fuck would you do? Drop them or let them drop you? I chose droppin' the cop I got me a Glock And a Glock for the niggas on my block The Glock is a gun of choice in my community. Like I said, it's like lookin' at a diamond. You got all these other stones, of course you're gonna pick that pretty diamond. And it just out... It outviews the rest of the guns. You can put a Glock and you put the rest of the guns, I guarantee... And... people give up a Desert Eagle and that's a big old, long, steel gun. But they gonna pick that Glock. I had an extended clip to mine, so my Glock shot... I think 30 plus times. Like, here the clip. This was a regular 9 mm with a clip this long. And... Man, I'm tellin' you, I was crazy. There's people all across this country and in other countries that listen to this music, that love this music, that are influenced by this music in a very real way. Gun manufacturers are getting this all for free. And the reason they can't acknowledge this free marketing is because they know that it's being marketed in the context of violence. Ain't no Glock Like the one I got Glock didn't want their name mentioned in rap music, because the references were so common that people were starting to think that Glock was just another name for gun. And that is their worst nightmare. They want to ensure that people know that that name and the look of the gun are protected. They're distinct. 'Cause Glock is something special. It's all black, it's solid, stripped down to a purely utilitarian tool. Cool, rugged. You see what I got. You know what it does. I ain't afraid to use it. Don't test me when I got my Glock. Back and forward. let's go. Jab. There you go. Look at me. Put it back. Jab. Put it back. Jab. There we go! That's what I'm talkin'! Do it again! To be a gang banger... and to not have a gun is just like a barber without clippers. So... gang, gun, grows hand in hand. You can't be in a gang without a gun, because this gun is... If you can't fight... But if you can fight... this gun is bigger than life. This gun is what puts you on top and puts you above everybody else. Especially if you know what to do with it. Go. One, two, three. I always wanted to be a drug dealer. ‘Cause my life was so poor and the drug dealers, the pimps, the hustlers would ride down the street -with their pretty cars. -Good job, AJ. Yes. sir. No. Hey. So, as a youth,  it's something like... it was a life, like... It was more than I ever had, so... that's exactly what I wanted to do. That's what I wanted to be. One, two. One, two. Some people say, "Guns don't kill people. People kill people." I talked to a guy who recently had a very interesting argument. He said, "There is a demon living in this pistol." My thing with the gun. When I shot... I don't know about this demon, but I get high. I mean, your adrenaline comes up... so high, it's like floatin'. When you're shootin' behind that gun... You can't even...  You really don't even realize what you're doin'. It's almost if you smoked some... leaf. Smoked some PCP or somethin'. Just for that split second, or whatever how long you get, you get high. And the more you get high, it becomes an addiction. And that's one of the worst addictions I could've probably ever picked up. Was the addiction of shootin' a gun. Threat! Scan and assess. Holster! Turn to the left! Turn ot the left! On "threat," we're gonna step forward with our left foot. Shooter ready? Threat! Scan and assess. Holster! Every day, I carry a Glock 19. And that gun is actually… feels to me like an extension of my body. I carry it... regularly. Without it on, I feel naked. It's... so comfortable to me to have it on, and know that it's there. And I've carried for so long, that… without it it just feels uncomfortable. Sometimes, even when I would sit down on the couch next to my husband, he would wrap his arm around me and say, "You still have your gun on." And I'm like, "I forget that it's there, because it's always there." It's there 24 hours a day. Now over top with your hand just like I showed you. You don't wanna put your pinkies near this ejection port cause it'll pinch you. -So, I'm back here? -Yup. And push and pull. And let it go. -Push what? -Push the... -Push this? -the receiver. the lower part of the gun. And pull the slide. Let it go. Perfect. -Okay. -All right. Now it's loaded. -Okay. -It's a round chambered. All right. Get that hand high on the back strap. Now, don't try to look for those sights with your head. You're doing that. -Okay. -Extend your arms out. Bend at the waist. Lock your arms. Bring 'em in. All right. Now, bring the gun to your eyes. I believe that the hand gun levels the playing field between a five-foot two woman, who weighs 115 pounds, against a man that's 300 pounds and on drugs of some sort, and his intention is to rape, or kill, or maim her. That levels the playing field. It gives her that... empowerment to know that she can stop him from doing that. Whenever you're ready. Just put pressure, pressure, pressure-- Focus only on the green dot and put pressure on the trigger until it breaks. Finger off the trigger. Relax your gun and bring it into your body. And look at your target. -Okay. That's not so good, is it? -What? -Yes, it is. You're in the red dot. -Okay. I had an 82-year-old lady who was a student of mine, and… and, when her husband passed away, she'd always had her dog to alert her if someone came to the door. And when her dog passed away... she decided that… she didn't wanna get another dog, 'cause she wanted to go travel a little bit. So, instead of getting another dog, she wanted to learn how to shoot a gun. And I asked her if she would like to just try to shoot my Glock. And she said ,"If you think that I can do it, then I'll give it a try." And she immediately went and bought a Glock and… she keeps it by her bedstand and… carries it in her glove box in her center console when she travels. She's... She feels safe again. And that's a great feeling for me to know that here this lady, as frail and elderly, didn't feel like she could protect herself. And now she can. Six, zero, six, just got... for unit number Boy, One... He's a gangster. Yeah, I think Glock would begin to look at the American market in the 1980s... about the mid 1980s. And then by the early 1990s, had established itself as quite successful. Glock targeted law enforcement in the United States. And they targeted the law enforcement successfully. They were able to persuade law enforcement agencies... increasingly, that they should have high-capacity semi-automatic pistols which were a better firearm for the law enforcement purposes than the old-fashioned revolver. But once you sold a gun to a law enforcement agency, the gun itself can last 20, 30, 40, 50 years. But that's not what a manufacturer wants to do. They wanna sell more guns. So, in order to that, Glock then began to sell semi-automatic pistols in higher calibers. It was a cycle of lethality. In other words, the police would have them, the criminals would have them, then the police would say, "We need a bigger caliber to deal with the criminals." So it's an endless spiral. I don't think Glock ever really thought that... selling to law enforcement is the endgame of their marketing. The endgame of their marketing is the much larger civilian population. OK, give us a little tour of the guns in your house? Okay. -The places how you store them? -I will show you one… first safe. It's a little unorganized at the moment. But we have everything locked up. There's probably… forty to fifty guns in this safe. There's another one. This safe is also a little unorganized but it has a lot of... my father's hunting weapons in it. This is one of the safes that I keep my handguns in. There's probably... fifty to sixty guns in this safe also. I'll just show you-- I like when different manufacturers do designs on... on different stuff. Like this one's labeled "thunder and lightning." And I also like 25th anniversary. I like collecting different models that... nobody else has. So, how many Glocks do you own? That's a good question. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... About 18 Glocks. Eighteen different models. -She did that easy! -Finger straight. Some people do it different. -Ready? -Whenever you are. Put your green dot right in the middle of your front sight and focus on... Right in the middle of the target. And focus on your front sight. Slow and… Perfect. So, can you explain to me what it means? Well, it's a picture of a Glock in front of our... our Constitution. And... the significance, of course, is our Second Amendment. The purpose the Second Amendment was created for was to protect us from the government. And that's why... our Constitution starts with "We, the people." Not with... "The subjects" or…"We, the government." It's with "We, the people," and part of… Before they would ratify the Constitution, they created the Bill of Rights… giving us... number one, our freedom of speech and religion and… then number two, our right to bear arms. And it was to protect us from… tyranny. And so, the picture of the Glock in front of the Bill of Rights that's is... is... its total significance. Do you think it's necessary to have something to protect yourself with? Yeah. I believe it's everybody's right to have something to protect themselves with. I mean... if you don't have something to protect yourself with… why, what's the point, you know, if somebody going in and threatening you, what's the point of continuing on with your life? You'd always be afraid of "OK, this person said they're gonna hurt me, so... I'm not gonna go to this place anymore, I'm not gonna go that place anymore." Whereas if you have a means to defend yourself, if, you know, the situation arises, it's best to... be able to defend yourself. Everybody has a right to defend themself. I'd rather have the gun and not need it. You know, it gives you… not necessary a sense of… Sort of like, like a sense of less fear. Like, I know in situations, like, when I go on vacation to other states, there's always that paranoia of, "I know I don't have a gun." So, I am extremely cautious about the area. Like, I won't go to certain areas that I know there was crime or anything like that. I'll definitely avoid them. Almost, like, avoiding a plague, you know. I choose to avoid those situations. Jab, jab. Good job. Do it again. Do it again. One, two. Fall. Fall. You know what happen when you goin' so fast? This is you startin' to do. Your hands goin' like this. I want you do to do it one, turn. Two, turn. Three, turn. Four, turn. -One, two. -Back. -One, two. -Back. -One, two. -Forward. -One, two. -Forward. -One, two. -Forward. -One, two. -Back. -One, two. -Back. -One, two. -Back. -One, two. -Back. When you have a poverty-stricken community, comes desperation. -One, two. -Forward. -One, two. -Forward. One, two. Desperation for survival. Same thing. Right here. Some people call this "Chiraq" because of the capacity of the violence is compared to Iraq. So, Chicago is basically known as "Chiraq" because of it's a warzone. You can see me? People prey on each other. That's what the drug selling's all about. Preying off your own people. Killin' people off. But, like I said, if you don't know better, how can you do better? Well, I lost my friend to gun violence. It was... 1996. This was my best friend. You know, me and him from... He moved here when I was in third grade. And we been like this... With those same vice lord laws that we followed. That was us, you know. Men's fought for the same cause. Everything we did. It was like a part of me. As he was standin' out there, while they were sellin' drugs. And he all... He had gun... He had a gun on him at the time. And somebody came from behind and shot him in the head. Shot him in the neck, his heart. Just multiple times, just shot his body up. He never made to see 20. That's what made me realize that... life wasn't a game. Human life wants to be valued. At the same time, we were also part of the violence, because... Walter was hard crook, criminal. And I was, too. I know, crying tears. Walter can never come back. There's somethin' was just tellin' me to kill every person that you can possibly think of. But then I'm sayin', "That's a lot of people." We have many enemies. And right before I was about to get up, I just heard a voice. It was telling me, "No, put the gun down." And I'm... I was… I was like, "Am I trippin'?" It was like, "Put the gun down." I just started cryin' even while I said, "I can't, I can't." It was like, "You can." "I can't." "You can." "I can't." "You can." And it's like I felt something touch my shoulders as I was crying'. And it said, "Everything is gonna be all right." Thank you. Chicago. 4th of July, 2015. Independence Day. Year after year, the annual day of celebration is one of the bloodiest on Chicago streets. Tonight's tally for gun violence: in eight hours, ten dead, 55 wounded. Both sides of the law reach for the same weapon. This is a .40 caliber Glock. You know, model 23, 4... generation 4, .40 caliber. With a 12-round magazine. There is a 19. Nine millimeter. Glock. This is also popular police gun? Oh, yes, yes. This is real popular. Almost… I'd say 60% of the Chicago Police Department have it, and all new people coming at the Police Department have this gun. You know, and it's a selling point for the manufacturer. Hey, police, army members use it. So, when a shooter says, "Hey, well, police, army use it. Well, I wanna be, you know what I mean, the police and army, too." So, normally, at this point, I'd make a joke, that this must be good news, because there's a lot of people standing up here. But that couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. We come here today... outraged and saddened... by the amount of gun violence that has plagued our city. Particularly, over the last 24 hours. And again, taken a life of another innocent child. While we normally wait until the conclusion of a weekend to release official enforcement statistics, I felt compelled to call you all together here, now, to explain to you what the Chicago Police Department, in our community, is up against and how aggressively we are fighting this problem. Every one of these firearms is an odd confrontation with a criminal. Every one of these firerarms puts our officers and the community in danger. Maybe we'll take another 10,000 guns off the street and another 10,000 will fill up that illegal market the next day. -Yes? -So, what's the problem you think? What is the problem? Come on, you know the answer. You know all the answers to that. You know the answers to that. This is about the gun lobby. My baby was seven, was seven years old. Seven. He hadn't lived. He wanted to be somebody. It was violence that took that away from me. I don't know where to go There is power in the name of Jesus There is power in the name of Jesus To break every chain, break every chain break every chain Hear the chains I hear the chains falling I hear the chains falling Let me go, let me go! I hear the chains falling This was my boy! My boy! No! I hear the chains falling I love you. -Stop the violence! -Increase the peace! -Stop the violence! -Increase the peace! -Stop the violence! -Increase the peace! -Stop the violence! -Increase the peace! -Stop the violence! -Increase the peace! Walk with us to stop the violence! No guns! Stop the violence! -Walk with us to stop the violence! -No guns! Stop the violence! Walk with us to stop the violence! No guns! Stop the violence! Walk with us to stop the violence! No guns! Stop the violence! -I will live... -I will live... -and go to college... -and go to college... -if we stop... -if we stop... -stop the violence! -stop the violence! NOT EVEN A NO COMMENT The Glock pistol, named after its inventor, is a semi-automatic, 18-round, nine-millimeter pistol. Firing tests show that the new army pistol is faster and more accurate than any other handgun. Designed to meet the highest safety standards, it is manufactured by a small company in Deutsch-Wagram. From CEO to cleaning lady, only 20 people work here. The plant previously made machine-gun belts, spades, made of plastic, like the pistol, and combat knives for both army and private use. The frame, grip, trigger and other important parts of the Glock are made of plastic. Only its barrel and breech are of tempered steel. It can be disassembled in a minute. Its innovative design sparked international and local media interest. The Glock is hailed as a super-pistol and an Austrian technological sensation. The Austrian army, which is still equipped with pistols from WWII, the German P38 and the American Colt, is really interested in the new weapon. The army is inviting bids for an initial order of 25,000 guns, final decision to be made in October. Civilian collectors and marksmen will have to wait patiently. The Glock pistol will be commercially available only in the spring of 1983. Are people concerned that an international arms manufacturer is based here? From what I can see, no. No. Even those who know that Glock is here aren't concerned that it's an international arms maker. It's not an issue. US gun lovers worship the plant here in Deutsch-Wagram like a shrine. It's the first time I hear that. It's where the pistol was invented in 1981. So that's not an issue? It's not an issue. Definitely not. Is the company an important employer here? Yes, yes. That may be a reason why people don't think or talk about it much. Jobs are desperately needed. Unemployment is rising, especially in our region. People are happy to have a job. And I can imagine that... I was never inside the factory... you don't make an entire Glock, the whole gun, but just one part of it. Right? Assembly stages are separate, or so I imagine. You don't think about it. What matters is that you get your monthly check. And that's it. The gate is in the back, it's usually open. I don't know if this is an access road. The section to the highway was only recently repaired and even paved, in fact. Whether parts... are delivered here for production, or whether they're shipped from here, I don't know. But... that is... the entrance to the Glock plant. And here, this is the Jewish cemetery. It's existed in Deutsch-Wagram for many years. The Jewish cemetery is now surrounded by the concrete walls of Glock, which purchased the entire site. Apparently there's an agreement whereby the Glock company looks after the Jewish cemetery. That may just be a rumor, I don't know. The fact is, the cemetery hasn't been cared for, which is a black mark on the municipality. Besides, this is the history. History of the weapons, the Jewish cemetery. Nobody knows anything or talks about it. They all try to forget. In Austria, our research meets with obstacles. Gaston Glock turns down our interview request. The firm refuses to talk to us. Its employees sign confidentiality clauses. No one who has dealings with the company is willing to appear on camera. I find Gaston Glock's name at the Schönbrunn Zoo, as godfather of the "death's head" monkeys. Paul, you were a corporate lawyer at Glock? Yes. What would you have done to people like us going around, asking tricky questions about the company? You wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the company. It's as simple as that. You wouldn't have gotten near the company and you wouldn't have gotten on the floor of the shot show. -Not even a "no comment"? -No. I mean... Chances are, you wouldn't have gotten a lot of information. What was the policy of Glock towards journalists in Austria? Well, I know they never spoke to 'em. But if... somebody did have the audacity to report the news, you know, their policy was quite simple. If his name appeared in print, they got sued. Paul Januzzo began his career in 1991 as a corporate lawyer and later rose to become CEO of Glock USA. Bloomberg Businessweek called him the embodiment of the US firearm industry. Under him, Glock USA developed from being a small, Austrian importer to the market leader of handguns in the USA. You know, I helped to shape Glock's image, without a doubt. You know, you don't have to be Einstein to figure out that, to the anti-gunners, being a law enforcement equipment company is more palatable to their sensibilities than being a firearms company. Same thing, but if you can cast yourself as a law enforcement equipment company, then you're on the side of, you know, righteousness and good, as opposed to being a big, bad, evil gun company. In central Texas, scenes from a massacre. The deadliest mass-shooting in American history. This is the CBS evening news. Dan Rather reporting. Good evening. A man went on a bloody rampage in central Texas today. He drove a truck into a cafeteria, opened fire on the crowd inside, and then committed suicide. The first time Glock was ever used in a mass-shooting, to my knowledge anyway, was in Killeen, Texas. And there was a guy that walked into a cafe, a diner, whatever, in Killeen, Texas. And I don't know how many people he shot, but... a lot. And... Usually, the company would have hidden from that. And this was... This was, really, I think about four months after I got there. So, I was still getting my feet wet. But instead of hiding from the news, my recommendation to the company at that point in time was to get in front of it. And I called a buddy of mine, who was a media specialist, and we set up a press conference to talk to the press about what happened. And to, like I said, to try to get in front of it. But the reality is, you know, as horrible as it may sound, people see that and... and once they look past the horrific circumstances, the next thing, apparently, that occurs to 'em is that it worked. So, it... As... You know, it's not the kind of marketing anybody wants. But, unfortunately, it works. Paul Januzzo was released from jail a few months before this interview. In 2009, he was convicted of embezzling funds from Glock. He avoided arrest by fleeing to Mexico and was later arrested in the Netherlands. After four years in custody, his sentence was overturned due to procedural errors. Januzzo sees himself as the victim of a conspiracy and is now suing Glock. When I left Gaston Glock and the Glock company, in... on February 3rd, 2003, it wasn't exactly text book-style termination. Definitely not one that Dale Carnegie would recommend in one of his courses. It was a huge argument. It was right after the shot show that I had mentioned before. I was not particularly happy with him. So, I called him up and told him I was gonna meet him at his house before he came into the office that day. And I drove over, and I quit. And I told him why I was quitting. Basically told him he disgusted me. And he went and got a gun. I could hear him load it in his room before he came back in and it was stuck into his belt. Part of our argument was, I told him if he touched his pistol again, I was gonna shove it so far up his ass he was gonna blow his tonsils off. And, you know, that was my termination. Not good. But on top of that, I had the fact that I knew way too much, because when we did the investigation for Glock, into his trustee, we uncovered what can only be described as massive tax fraud to the tune of, I think a hundre-- at least 80 million dollars, potentially a hundred million dollars that he had siphoned off the worldwide corporation via shell corporations and phoney bills and money laundering. So, we had... There's two strikes. The third strike was that I was dating Monika and eventually married her. And he had been pursuing her since 1995. And number four, you know, it was almost a de rigueur in Glock. You can... It's like the Mafia. You can join, but it's a capital offense to leave. Gaston Glock... the man behind the gun. Who owns a Glock? You guys, a lot of you watching the channel own a Glock, want a Glock, or have shot a Glock in the past. Boy, this gun has changed the firearm industry in a huge way for the better. And, I gotta tell you, this video is all about Gaston Glock, the man and the history behind how he created the empire that we now know as Glock. Gaston's still alive right now. Doin' real well. He's 83. He's got a 31-year-old wife, we're gonna talk about that. She's smokin' hot. But did you guys realize that 1999... someone tried messin' with Gaston? And you don't mess with Gaston Glock! His best friend, his business associate... messed with him. You know what he did? He tried to have Gaston assassinated. Have you talked to him? He's not too fond of the press. Well... How much liability insurance do you have, when the lawsuits start? That's his standard MO. Mention his name and he sues you. Anyway. It was a partnership. But... the courts decided otherwise. You're only referred to as a trustee. By him, yes. But in fact you spent 15 years helping to build the Glock empire. Not just build it. I also helped to run it. I was... in Vienna three times a month or in Klagenfurt. Whenever there was a problem, "Mr. Ewert, we need you. Only you can break it to him." I had to deliver all the bad news. He couldn't fire me. Everyone knew that. How did your relationship change over time? You met when the pistol was still-- The relationship was always the same, always good. It changed... on the day he was attacked with a hammer. An underground car park in Luxemburg. On July 27, 1999, three men meet here. Gaston Glock, inventor and businessman, his trustee, Charles Ewert, nicknamed Panama Charly, and former French paratrooper and pro wrestler, Jacques Pêcheur, nom de guerre, Spartacus. The meeting led to the revelation of the Glock company's financial network. And it marks the starting point of numerous myths. Did you try to kill Gaston Glock? If I wanted to have someone murdered, it wouldn't be done in my presence with a rubber hammer. I'm smarter than that. I would've been sitting on a terrasse with five notaries as witnesses and his body would've been found floating... somewhere off the coast of Latin America. That's just not my style. I mean, you can call me... You can say, "That bastard," "He's a lush," "He cons people, cheats, launders money." Whatever. But murder? No one would believe you. So, Charles Ewert and Gaston Glock, on the 27th July, 1999, they were riding by car, coming from the airport. They came down this ramp. And Charles Ewert stopped his car, asked Gaston Glock to come out of the car, and went backwards to park next to the wall. So, Gaston Glock was out first. Charles Ewert came out. And they both went in the direction of the staircase to go upstairs. So, Charles took out his key and put the key in the key hole. At that moment, Gaston Glock saw a nice collection car, a Morgan, and said to Charles, "I believe this is your car, isn't it? Or your new car?" Charles said, "Yes." And then Gaston Glock, by himself, by his own initiative, went in the direction of the car and started looking at it. And in that moment Jacques Pêcheur arrived. One thing is for sure. Pêcheur came from here. He had a hammer made of plastic in his hand. The kind of hammer you use for tiling. When the attack started, Charles Ewert got scared, immediately pushed open the door, with his key, called the lift, realized that the lift was busy, or was not coming down. So, he decided to run up the stairs, run out the door, and called his office. His secretary answered. He told them, "Call the police! Gaston Glock is being attacked." We have one witness who arrived on the crime scene... after those 15 minutes. And he found Pêcheur on top of Glock. But Glock did have the plastic hammer in his hand, and Pêcheur was holding his hand. While Gaston Glock was laying on his bed at the hospital, he asked the bankers to come, Mr. Rusch and Mr. Maurer. And immediately asked for his briefcase, asked for the banker to look in his briefcase. There were powers of attorneys in order to operate on the bank accounts of Reofin and other various offshore companies. And immediate instructions were given to empty some of those bank accounts. He tried to empty all, but... one of the power of attorneys was not drafted properly, so one of the bank accounts was not emptied that day. So, just a few hours after the attack, -a lot of money was transferred? -Yes. How much? We’re talking about at least $35 million US dollars. Charles Ewert pioneered the setting up of shell companies in tax havens. Gaston Glock first contacted him in 1985. He needed help to expand his weapons company. How can I start a venture without money? By using... the financial instruments that existed then, that today are frowned upon, but that made Luxemburg the player it is. You create equity using... tax money that you haven't paid yet. You know. And then you reinvest it. That, basically, is the secret of his success. The problem is the pie wasn't shared. Or there'd never have been a problem. If he'd had his share, and I'd had mine, all good. But there was only one pot, and we both helped ourselves to it. How big was the pot? Big. You could've easily bought a jet without... Is there a ballpark figure? A three-digit million figure. No need to say more. But you'd have controlled $70 or $80 million in bank accounts, if Glock had died on that day. I controlled them anyway. I had control anyway. At the time of the interview, Charles Ewert had spent 13 years in jail. He was found guilty of ordering the murder of Gaston Glock. Charles Ewert, too, sees himself as a victim of conspiracy. If you were to run into Gaston Glock, would you have anything to say to him? No. A gesture, though. It would be a message... to tell him... You could kill him with a .22, to show that smaller calibers can do the job. Something that would be inconceivable to him. He doesn't know how the Mossad handled the terrorists behind the 1972 attack in Munich. They were all... liquidated... with .22s. All you need are exceptional marksmen. You don't hear a thing, though. A .22 with a silencer. That's all. And on the street... Someone walking on the Kärntner Straße. You can shoot him from behind and no one will hear a thing. Or am I missing something? No, I mean... I don't think we'll ever meet again. Velden am Wörthersee. Here, at the end of the rainbow, lives Gaston Glock. The tax scandal around Panama Charly ebbed when the case was transferred from Vienna to Klagenfurt. Then governor Jörg Haider publicly sided with Gaston Glock. Glock oversees the Glock Horse Performance Center in Treffen, home of the world's most exclusive equestrian events. Photos show the engineer with guests such as Chuck Norris, Mariah Carey and Jean-Claude Van Damme. When not watching dressage events, patrons write checks to charities. Glock gives to handicapped kids, Syrian war refugees, local causes. And most of all, animals. Robbie Williams is flown in for Gaston Glock's birthday to sing the inventor's favorite song. "My Way," by Frank Sinatra. Do you have flashbacks? Every day. Flashbacks is a common, natural courtesy of my brain. It comes and goes. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But it's always there. To many, this is not a gorgeous view. To me, it's the best. Nothing but open water ahead o' you and then you see the lights. Every light is a thought. You turn it into a pattern. Well, this is my relaxation. My beauty, shall I say. I come out here whenever, just sit down and relax or release my stress, ‘cause if if I'm lookin' at the water, I could go over there, I could work out. I'd play handball, there's a basketball court. I can run around. This is actually like a smaller track, so you can run around as well. This is, at night time, a personal time. Normally, I don't bring people out here. I don't... wanna be with nobody. I prefer being left alone when I'm thinking and... or I'm in a state of mind where I deem myself... unfit to be around other people, or mentally unstable, shall I say. And then I come here for a couple hours and I go back like it was a normal day. Short and simple. In September of '02, I was shipped out to Kentucky for my training... as a scout, as infantry, as a tank driver. We had different kinds of weapons, that were being... set up and transported around. So, we had to test them. After about three or four months of all this special training... already in my head, I already had it set that I was goin' over for war. Picked up the phone, called my wife, my family, said, "I'm leaving. I just wanna say goodbye. Love you guys. In case you don't hear from me ever again," stuff like that. We were originally supposed to come in through Turkey, but we came in through Baghdad. I got attached to a special force unit in the green berets unit, to run the black list. December 13, 2003. Ad-Dawr, Iraq. Operation Red Dawn. We been workin' on missions on blacklist guys. Our missions all were well detailled, a little bit of goin' out for several days and several nights, overwatching locations to where these guys on the blacklist was. Especially number one was Saddam Hussein. On this particular night, we were supposed to raid the area in Ad-Dawr, where Saddam was. And how there was once again no real guarantee he was there, 'cause our intel, as we watched, we didn't see much of anybody coming in and out. We noticed the size of the hole. The gap there was. We had to pick the thinnest guy to be able to go in there. But the one with the senior ranking. Which wasn't me, either way. But unfortunately, commander comes over, "You, Cruz, you're gonna go in. Take off your flak vest and make sure the guys are watching. I jumped into the hole, followed by one of the other guys. Already... Saddam Hussein was already stunned in the corner. He was holdin' his AK-47 in his hand. And on the bed, he had a Glock there. Everybody was trying to get their hands on this Glock. Whatever trophy was caught from his capture was gonna go to the president who put us out in Iraq. That was a guarantee. So whatever was brought back from Saddam, that was gonna be personal, was gonna go to George W. Bush. And when we got back to Texas, they had the ceremony where he was receiving the Glock. We will not tire, we will not falter... Tonight we are a country relating to danger. We are called to defend freedom. I think about the families, the children... who carried out yesterday against our country... They were acts of war. So the visitor just got done learning all about the creation of the Patriot Act, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, Iraq's first democratic election. And now they get to learn about the Bush doctrine. The Bush doctrine is simply four ideals that completely describe why we are fighting a global war on terrorism. "Take the fight to the enemy." "Make no distinction between terrorists and the nations that harbor them." "Confront threats before they fully emerge." And "Advance freedom." Right there, those four thoughts completely summarize what this entire portion of museum is all about. Advancing freedom, spreading democracy, fighting terror. Simply put, in four different statements. Now, when the visitor is in this section, there is an artifact that they may not even know it exists. So when they come through here, they see this big glass stanchion. They notice the giant arrow, they notice the shield, they notice the poster and then all of a sudden, right there in the middle of the stanchion there's a Glock. Now, they're not quite sure who the Glock belongs to, so they start to read. And they notice that this was the pistol that Saddam Hussein had on his person when Special Forces captured him in that spider hole. Course, after they detained him, they took that pistol, they framed it and they said, "Mr. President, right here you have Saddam Hussein's nine-millimeter Glock." We put it on display. Why do we put artifacts like this on display? Well, this is an important part of the narrative. This symbolizes the point where Iraq was underneath the thumb of a dictator. And now had the opportunity to become a democratic nation. While some may only see it as a Glock, this is one of the most important historical artifacts that we have because of the symbolism. Here's some pictures that I have. Here's the original of that one. When I first came back to see my child and everybody else on R&R. everybody thought that I was locked up a long time, or on crack, or I was dying, 'cause of how skinny I was. I went from being a 200-plus-poiund guy that lifted weights and played football to bein' 125 pound. So, that was that struggle. You see the colorations on my hand, they start from sandstorms, and burns from fires and RPG attacks. My memories… Then goes the bastard there. See on the bottom of this, "Captured Saddam Hussein, 13th December, 2003, in Ad-Dawr, Iraq." It's a... It's definitely a day you don't forget. And I have other things, ARCOMs and stuff like that, I left all that in Jersey. Presidential award. Garbage. All this paper. I keep sayin' on people all these papers is just garbage. It's waste o' trees. It's a waste o' trees. So you guys still got factories out there building the... these weapons? How rapid are they doin' it, you know? I think every few minutes. I mean, it takes only probably a few minutes to make a Glock. -It's, you know, made out of plastic. -Yeah. So... Doesn't cost anything. It'll cost you your life, eventually. Remember that one. Nothing in this world is free. That's what I... Who was I tellin' that yesterday to? That, "No, but it's free." I said, "Nothing in this world is free." No matter how you look at it. It could be handed, you could have found it, some way somehow you're gonna pay in return for it. In my true, honest words, karma is a bitch. I've lived it. I've done wrong things and wrong things have been done to me. I live by this, karma… It will come back around and bite you. And it may not be as soon as you think, but it's definitely gonna catch up to you. 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror created a gold rush for arms manufacturers. After the US invasion of Iraq, Iraqi security services were disbanded. Police officers left their posts with their weapons. The US interim government ordered Glocks from Austria to arm the new Iraqi security forces. The deal was controversial. Can a neutral country ship arms to war zones? Glock threatened to move production abroad unless export licenses were granted. The Ministry of Commerce relented and allowed the arms shipments, arguing that, "Pursuant to the Foreign Trade Law, arms shipments are only approved when there are no grounds to believe that the arms will end up in terrorist hands." Don't tell him too much. Give short answers. When the Americans equipped us with these Glocks, they also trained us to disassemble and clean them. They took us to the firing range and practiced shooting with us. It's certainly a good pistol to have on you. Unfortunately we don't have enough Glocks for all our men. Because for a policeman, a Glock is really necessary. We have enough Kalashnikovs, but they're not suited to daily use, whereas for policemen Glocks are very practical. So, I'm still short. For example, I have 750 police officers here, and we've been sent only 100 Glocks. So you have some information whether ISIS is using Glocks as well? Do you information whether ISIS is using Glocks as well? I am pretty sure they can get Glocks, because there are places where to buy. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they can, you know, get Glocks because there are some places they could sell Glocks. It's easy to get. Salaam-Alaikum. Dear brothers, especially brothers, and also sisters. I am in the land of jihad at the moment with a Glock 19. Yeah? Most of you playboy guys ain't seen this yet. I've got a box of ammunition from our so-called brothers, the Free Syrian Army. What I was come to do here, it's what's prescribed to us as Muslim men. So while you are sitting down on the corner, on a block, you know, chasing that squealer, chasing that honey that walks past, with the low batties on, -with your hands down your trousers... -Getting semis. ...getting semis... we're busting semis actually. But what really is, and what I ask Allah to keep us sincere on this path and keep us firm. Where are you when the women are calling in the jails getting raped by these dirty Kuffars? Where are you when we need to start taking heads off? So like I said I asked Allah to keep us sincere in the land of jihad. But I also invite you all over to the land of jihad. Allah akbar! We deal with Glocks here. We also deal in M4s and M16s. In 2006 you could get a Glock for $ 1,200. Today they cost $ 2,400. We tell Arabs in ISIS territories to buy Glocks and bring them here. They're half the price there. When the Iraqi army in Mosul was smashed, people looted the armories. Any child could grab five or six guns. In 2006 everyone who joined the police was issued a Glock. Later they'd leave the police, sell the Glock, join the force again and get another Glock. Government didn't do anything to stop that. They were all corrupt. You could help us. Maybe you start doing this. You bring Glocks from Austria, and we sell it here. Maybe you start doing this. You bring Glocks from Austria, and we sell them here. It would be nice to get a permit, an international permit, be a weapons supplier for those conflicted areas. So I'll be the master of the war. This is a lot of money to supply, like, the Peshmerga, for instance, to supply them with weapons. You make lot of money. You know who makes the Glocks. You could talk to them to get me a permit. You might not be able to get a permit from them to be a weapons supplier. But maybe you can talk to them get me a permit and we'll be partners. There's a lot of money in there. And I'll make sure they won't get in wrong hands. Glock began production in the 1980s, with 1,000 units a month. Today 34,000 leave this factory every week. That's over 1.5 million guns a year, supposed to stay out of the wrong hands. Demand is on the rise. Since 2015, even Austria has witnessed a surge in private gun ownership. Because of this increasing demand, Glock, as stated in its annual report, looks to the future with great optimism.
