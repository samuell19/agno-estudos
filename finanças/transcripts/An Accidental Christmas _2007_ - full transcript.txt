[peaceful orchestral music] [festive orchestral music] - No, no, I'll be back in right after lunch. You'll have the drafts on your desk by four o'clock. No, that's my other line. Listen, just tell Myles that he'll have them. Victoria Wright. - Evidently our property taxes weren't paid. - Hello to you too, Jason. - According to this, we owe some kind of a penalty now. [chuckles] Lucky us. - Well, did you pay it? - You take care of these things. - But I'm not living in the house anymore, so obviously I am not going to be keeping track of these things anymore, am I? - [Jason] Then why don't you, I don't know, make a list or something? - [Victoria] Jason, you're the one who insisted on staying in the house. - I don't know why I'm expected to leave the house when you're having some kind of a mid-life crisis! Or something. - I'm getting Will the Herculaneum action figure he wanted. - [sighs] Her-what? What are you talking about? - Christmas, the kids. Try not to forget that too. - This is... This is really not working for me, Vic. This has been going on since last Christmas. How long do you think this separation thing is gonna last? - I don't know. - Well, I hope you figure out whatever you need to figure out soon, because the rest of your family's lives are falling apart. [phone rings] - Oh. [sighs] Victoria Wright. No. No, I emailed those to the building inspector this morning. - Improving all my work? - Oh. Myles, no, of course not. I was just doodling. - Well, let me see. You've widened the hole by six inches. That's a waste of space. - Well, actually it's not. It opens up the sight-line in the living room, giving it a better view and it creates this extra little area here for another closet. [Myles chuckles] - You know, you're really quite good. - I feel it coming back, slowly. - Now, don't sell yourself short. If you'd stuck at this, you'd have your own firm by now. - Uh, I finished the electrical drafts that you wanted. - You gave up a lot for your family. - Oh, speaking of family. I've gotta pick up Will and take him to karate class. - A working mother's life, not a moment's rest. Well, I am going to take your change, and make it my own brilliant idea. - Brilliant? - Don't let it go to your head. [chuckles] - And have Sullivan bring all the cases dealing with trademark-- - Okay but you actually-- - Who's that redhead at paralegal? Have her sent to my office. - Got it. - I want her to write up a draft for the Simons case, too. And what about that call to Jack Sever? Have we done that too? - Excuse me! - Kristine. If you have something to say, just say it. - Your daughter, you're supposed to pick her up from school. - What time is it? Oh, no. Not again, um, okay, give this to Judge Murphy, and explain I will review the case tomorrow morning with him but I'm sorry I missed and I had to go pick up my daughter. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, honey, I'm sorry. - It's no problem, Tracy's mom dropped me off. - [sighs] It's just... We got tied up in this deposition and I... I blew it, sorry. - This kinda stuff never happened when you and Mom were together. - Yeah, tell her that. - Come on, we're gonna be late. Karate practice, in like 15 minutes? Seriously, Dad, don't you remember anything? Is he always like that? - Always. - [Jason] Hey, hey, hey, hey, no teaming up. [boys grunt] - That's it, guys, keep those hands up, keep those hands up. Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving. - But I don't understand. You mean we're not gonna have Christmas together? - We're gonna be together. We're gonna drive up to grandma and grandpa's a few days before Christmas, we'll have Christmas Eve dinner with them. - And what about Dad? - Well, on Christmas Day, then we'll drive back down, so you can be with your dad. - Where will we do presents? - Both places. It'll be like having two Christmases. - I don't want Christmases. I want one Christmas like we always do. - Tiger, I know this isn't easy for any of us, but it'll be wonderful, I promise. - Alright. - Hey, Mom. - Oh hi, honey. Boy, you look cute. - Thanks. - I thought you forgot. - Of course not. Just got caught in a little traffic. How's the new job going? - It feels good. Myles is giving me more to do all the time. - Oh, Myles Kelly always had a thing for you. - What? That's crazy. - A husband knows. Trust me. You never notice how he just happened to take his vacation at the beach at the same exact time that we always did? - He owns a place there, it was a coincidence. - Once or twice is a coincidence, but he did it practically every time. - [Instructor] Arms out. Bring down to you. And bow. - Myles has been a godsend, he's taking a chance on me when I haven't worked in 15 years. - Three guesses why. - Don't start that again. - What? Tell me, what do you want, huh? Do you want me to bring home flowers occasionally? Do you want me to take you out on date night or something? Fine. I'll do it. Just tell me what you want. - I just, wanna feel like me again. - What am I supposed to do with that information? - I don't know, Jason, I really don't. It's not a trial, it's not evidence. [children and instructor grunt] - People ask me why we separated and I just look at them. To tell the truth, I have no idea. - Which is exactly the problem, because you have been so busy working 90 hours a week, that you didn't even realize we had a problem! - I work to pay for our house, to pay for our cars, to pay for everything else, that was our deal. I make the income, you take care of running the house. - Our deal? And you wonder why I needed time away from you. - Mom, Dad! Why don't you just go on a TV show so the whole world could see you fight? - Sorry. - [Instructor] Let's go, guys, come on, here we go. And go one, two! And go one, two! - I gotta get going anyway. You've got the kids tonight, right? And what do we do about Christmas? - Well, Melissa wants to go on that Disney World trip with Tracy's family, but I-- - I think that's a good idea. - For her to be away from us on Christmas? - Come on, Vicky, we're not really together anyway, are we? You can't have it both ways. - I thought you said they'd work it out. - Maybe I was wrong. [festive orchestral music] - Oh, no. - What's wrong? - Oh, it's just the beach house. The family that was supposed to rent it for Christmas week just canceled on me. - Maybe we could go. - Oh, Tiger, we can't. I've got way too much to do, and we're driving up to your grandmother's tomorrow. Besides, there's nothing Christmassy about the beach. - [sighs] Melissa's getting to go to Disney World, and I'm not getting to do anything. - Honey, I know-- - This is gonna be the worst Christmas ever. - Would you like to yell at me now? - Why bother? Everybody else is doing such a good job. - Is that the wedding album? [warm orchestral music] - I forgot you and Dad spent your honeymoon at the beach house. - Your grandparents bought that house back in the fifties, before you had to be a multi-millionaire to own beach-front property in California. And then, when your dad made partner, they gave it to us. We renovated it, of course, but it was worth it. Started renting it out, with the hopes that the money would go towards starting my own design firm. Well, you know what happened to that. - But you guys took us down there every summer. Even when I was little, I remember going. - Yeah, we certainly had some very good times there. - So, what happened, Mom? Were you really that unhappy with Dad? - No, Melissa, I wasn't happy. But I promise you, it had nothing to do with you or your brother. - But now it's like you're this whole other person. You're working all the time. - It's a little overwhelming for me too. But I like it. I mean, for the first time in ages, I don't feel like I'm a piece of furniture that people just pass by as they go about their lives. - Dad wants you to come back, he told me so. - Your father wants someone to cook and clean, and pay the bills and pick up the kids. Honestly, if he just got a good housekeeper, he wouldn't even miss me. - Mom. - I wish it weren't true. I'm gonna go check on your brother. [playful orchestral music] - Your daughter's on the phone. I told her you were getting ready for court, but she says it's really important. - Alright, I have a few moments, thanks. Hey, sweetie. I thought you were on your way down to Disney World. - Tracy's family can't go on the trip. Tracy got really sick. - Oh, that's terrible. - And Mom and Will already left for grandma's, so, now I have nothing to do for Christmas. [suspenseful music] - Hey, hey, hey, you're not gonna believe this, but our beach rental just fell out. - You're kidding. - Hey, how about we head down there? - That sounds great. - Well, I'll have Kristine book the flights, and I'll call and tell your mom. - Oh, that's Mom beeping through on my line now. I'll tell her. - Terrific. Hey, Melissa? We're gonna have fun. - We're gonna get in so much trouble for this. - Desperate times call for desperate measures. Your turn. - Hey, Grandpa? It's Will. Yeah, listen, about that. I was wondering if you could do Melissa and me a favor? - Why haven't you gone for Christmas yet? - We're leaving in an hour. I just wanted to get the Anderson schematics out before the holiday. - All work and no play. - So I've heard. [phone rings] Victoria Wright. - Mom? - Hey, Tiger. I'll be home in 15 minutes. - Mom, we can't go. - [Victoria] Of course we can go. - [Will] Grandpa just called, he said they both got some kind of flu and could we maybe go up next week instead? - What else could go wrong? Alright, let me call them and see what I can do. - Oh, Mom, I was thinking, couldn't we just go to the beach house, the two of us? - I don't know. - Hey, why don't you go? I'm gonna be up there for Christmas too. - Who's that? - Myles. - Come on, it'd be fun. - Mom, please. - I don't know. - Come on, as Elvis would say, it'll be a blue Christmas without you. [Victoria chuckles] - Okay, I guess we're going to have a beach Christmas this year. - Great. - Yes! [upbeat music] ♪ Well it's a California Christmas ♪ ♪ And it's the best time of the year ♪ ♪ Put away your boots and your big snow suits ♪ ♪ 'Cause you won't need them here ♪ ♪ Pack up all the surfboards and get ready to go ♪ ♪ You can wear your sandals 'cause it never snows ♪ - Wow. I always forget how beautiful it is. - There's not all the crowds like there usually are in the summer. - You know, this is the way it looked when we first came here. - Your honeymoon? - Yeah. - Dad! No work. - I was just checking my messages. - You promised. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right, I should just... Relax and unwind and... Spend some amazing one-on-one time with my favorite teenager. [chuckles] Wanna catch some waves? - Absolutely! [Jason chuckles] - You're on. [upbeat music] Ah, welcome to your Christmas break. - I'm gonna go get my suit on. - Okay. Ah! Place looks good! Sweetie, do you remember where we keep the towels? - Uh yeah, I'll get 'em. - Okay, I'll meet you downstairs in what, 15 minutes? - Sounds good. - Yeah. - Well, here we are. Oh, Rico must be here. I should have called him to tell him we were coming. I feel kind of bad being on vacation when your grandparents are so sick. - You called them, right? - Oh, yeah. They didn't sound sick to me, but according to your grandfather, they're both really contagious. So, it won't be exactly what we planned, but we should have a great Christmas. - [Will] Uh-huh. - Rico? Hello? Oh. [gasps] [Jason yelps] [playful orchestral music] - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - There was a cancellation. - I know, I got it, but I thought-- - I thought you were at your parents'. - They're sick. - Hi, Mom. - You're supposed to be in Orlando. - Tracy's family canceled the trip. - Don't tell me, someone got sick. - Well, uh, how about that? Guess we're all stuck here, huh? - Oh well, guess I'm hitting the beach. Wanna come? - Oh, yeah. - I have a sneaking suspicion that we were set up. [Jason chuckles] - You really can't blame them wanting to spend Christmas together. - Did you have anything to do with this? - No, no way. - Okay. Well, then we'll just have to make the best of it. - [Jason] Well, what else can we do? - Although, nothing's changed. We'll still do our separate things with the kids. - Sure. No problem. You go your way, and I'll go mine. - Exactly. Agreed? [playful orchestral music] But I get the master bedroom. [upbeat music] [Melissa giggles] - Okay, okay, Melissa, right here, right here! Woo! - Yeah! [Melissa laughs] [man clears his throat] - Miss Vicky! - Rico! - Hey, you look good! Very good energy. [Victoria laughs] - And you look the same as you have for the last 20 years. Don't you ever age? - I gave it good consideration, but I decided against it. [Victoria laughs] - I am sorry we didn't let you know we were coming ahead of time, but the place looks beautiful. You're still the best caretaker on the beach. - Aw, thank you. I pretty much take care of this whole stretch myself. - Woo! - Yeah! [Melissa laughs] - Yours? My, they are so big now. [sighs] I remember them as little babies. - They're definitely older. And more devious. [Rico chuckles] Rico, you should know, Jason and I are separated now. - Oh. [melancholic orchestral music] That's not good, that's not good news at all. - It's an adjustment, for all of us. Especially the kids. - Something happened? Did... Never mind. It's not my business. - It's okay. The truth is, it isn't any one thing. I guess we both just changed. [sighs] The Jason I married-- - Come on, Will. - Disappeared a long time ago. - Change? Yes, change is often difficult. Take a look at this beach. It's changed so much since I've been here. - And yet it still maintains its magic. Jason and I weren't so lucky. - Yeah! - Nice one, Dad. [Will laughs] - So how about you, have you been working hard? - Let's go see your mom up here, okay? - Okay, Will, come on. - Yeah, throw, come on! - Ah. - Ah, Mr. Jason. - [laughs] Hey, Rico. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. - To you and your family. You know, you must come to my Christmas Day party. You've never seen my house, you must come. Many people from this side of the beach will be there. - Well that sounds great, we'd love to. - Excellent, I will leave directions for you. I trust that you will enjoy your vacation here. Perhaps, you can find some magic of your own. - [Jason] You told him, didn't you? - Tell him what? - About us. - It's not a secret. - You haven't even changed into your bathing suit yet. - Well, that was your time with the kids. - We always go to the beach together. - Jason. We talked about this. - Look, look. If you're not gonna try to patch things up, then what are we even doing? - I am not here to patch things up. Look, we'll make this as nice as we can for the kids, because God knows I don't wanna make it any more difficult for them than it's already been. But just because we're out here in the middle of paradise doesn't mean that anything's changed between us. - Well, what are you saying? Are you saying that it's over? - Jason. That's what I've been telling you for months. You just haven't heard me. I'm gonna go up to the farmers market and stock up. [children talking over each other] [upbeat music] [background chatter] - [Man] Hi. - Hi, may I have these and three oranges, please? - [Man] Sure, I'll put them in a bag for you. - Thank you. Myles, hey. - Hey there. - You made it. - I caught the red eye last night. - Oh, that's great. - Well what do you think? - It's beautiful. - [Myles] Yeah. - I've never had Christmas at the beach. - [chuckles] Well, you can't exactly cozy up to a warm fireplace, but the sunsets are spectacular. Speaking of which, would you like to join me for a drink at the Paterson? - Oh, I don't know. Kids are back at the beach house, and-- - Come on, Vicky. For the first time in a long time, you're your own woman. It's okay to do something you want to do for a change. - Do they make Christmas Mai Tais? [Myles chuckles] - I believe they do. [Victoria giggles] - Well, then. - How do you think it's going? - I can't tell, but this should help. We've gotta get the two of them back up there. - What for? - [Melissa] For this. - Yuck! - Trust me, okay? - Hey, guys? Melissa, Will? - We're in here, Dad. - Hey, guys. What do you say we head into town and see if we can find your mom and maybe have a little dinner, all of us together? Does that sound like fun? - Sure. - Great! - Well, then let's do it. [upbeat music] - And Markowitz started chasing after the building inspector's car, he was determined to drag him back or, I don't know, kidnap him or something, anything to get the certificate of occupancy. - He actually chased him down? - Yes, he grabbed hold of the guy's car door, and he was yanking on it, screaming in the guy's face. - He must have thought that Markowitz was crazy. - But he was crazy. I mean, that's what building a house will do to you. - So what happened? - Well, the building inspector zoomed off and, and actually, the very next day, we had our certificate of occupancy. - Oh, I'm gonna have to remember that strategy. - Well, I wouldn't recommend it, but it is very effective. You should laugh more. It makes your eyes sparkle. I'm glad you came. I'm used to being alone. That happens all the time, but you know, Christmas, it can be a little tougher. [Victoria clears her throat] - You should know that Jason is here, and Melissa. We're all here. - Oh, I'm sorry, I thought... - It happened accidentally. Nothing's changed. - Well, I don't want to get in the middle of anything but, like I said to you in the office, don't sell yourself short. You're an amazing woman. - Doesn't always feel that way. - Well, I find that if I have a few sips of Mai Tai, then I feel wonderfully fantastic about myself. [Victoria giggles] - [Jason] I love this place. - Yeah, I remember when we came here, it was really good. - You hungry, huh? - Yeah. - Totally starving. - [Will] Dad, are you goin' in or what? - Um... You know, I'm not feeling the burger thing anymore. Let's go find that fish joint, huh? - Do they have fish burgers? - [Jason] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I thought that lobster claw was gonna come up and pinch you to death! - Yeah, yeah, pinch you. - [Jason] Yeah, but she ate the whole thing. - [Melissa] Yeah, right. Great job, Will, way to go. - It was pretty good. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Mom, where were you? - Yeah, we looked all over town. - Yeah, Vic, we couldn't imagine where you'd gone to. - I ran into Myles, so we started talking business. - Well, we certainly missed you. We had a wonderful dinner together, didn't we? - I'm glad you enjoyed your time with the kids. - Yes, while you were stuck with Myles. You're becoming quite the career woman, aren't you? - I'm sorry I missed it. It sounds like it was fun. - Hey, maybe we can all go for a hike tomorrow. Up to the ranch or something, maybe? - That sounds nice, I haven't been to the ranch in ages. - Well, are you sure you can tear yourself away from Myles? Oh, I mean, uh, work. - It's really sweet of you to be concerned, Jason, but um, I think I'm all caught up, thanks. - I love you kids. [sighs] [melancholic orchestral music] [Rico laughs] - It was so nice of my parents to give us their house for our honeymoon. - [chuckles] I have a feeling that you will make many happy memories here. - [chuckles] Starting tonight. - Shh! [Rico laughs] - Thanks, Rico. [laughs] - Vic. Someday when I make partner, we'll be able to afford a house just like this, of our very own. - And I'm gonna design it, we can make it like those houses we like in Key West with the arches. - Anything you design will be beautiful. - Yeah and you're gonna be the youngest lawyer to make partner. - I will. - No doubt. - You watch. - Mm-hm. - Come on, Dad. - I got some work to do, you guys go have some fun. - Dad, we're all supposed to go together. - I'll see you when you get back, okay? - Come on, guys, great day for a bike ride. [peaceful orchestral music] Helmet! [Jason sighs] [Jason chuckles] Wow, look at how green it is up here. It's so beautiful. Hey, Will, do you remember coming here? Hey, Melissa, stop. The trail's up there, isn't that where you wanted to go? - No. - I thought-- - Well I don't, okay? Can we just ride? [Victoria chuckles] - Promise me you'll never become a teenager. - One more year. - Great. [festive orchestral music] - [Will] I win, I win! - You cheated. - Loser. - Hey, Vicky! - Oh! Hey! I'll be right there, guys. [Jason laughs] - Hey, Dad, you keep busy? - Yeah, yeah, I did. - It just doesn't seem right, jogging on the beach two days before Christmas. Where's the snow? - I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is the life. Looks like you've been getting a little exercise yourself. - Oh yeah, we rode up to the point and back. Keeping up with a 12-year-old is hard work. - Listen, I don't know if you've got any plans while you're here, but... The Carrolls and Bob Perkins are coming over for a cocktail tonight and I was hoping that you could join us. - Oh, well you know, I've got the kids and-- - You know the Carrolls are talking about building a house down in the Miami and I thought it might be something you'd be interested in. - Well, you know I'll draft anything you need me to. - Well, I was actually thinking more in terms of you helping to design it. - Designing it? Me? - Oh, you know, and supervising the project. I can't be everywhere. But you know, if you're busy, I understand. - Well, I'm sure that I can steal away for an hour or two. - Great. Well listen, I'll see you around seven. - Oh my goodness. - Hey, Mom, isn't it great? Dad decorated the whole place. - Wow, you've been busy. - Yeah. - Lunch too? - Just trying to pull my own weight. - It looks great. - Enjoy it. - Aren't you gonna eat? - I already ate. I think maybe I'll go out for a walk. [melancholic piano music] Hey, Rico. - Hi, Mr. Jason. This is my friend Saul. You care to join us? - If you don't mind. - More fishermen, more fish. - Sure, grab a worm. - Great. [knocks] - Ah, silent treatment. [melancholic orchestral music] I remember doing that to my mom. - I just don't have anything to say to you. - Melissa. I have tried to be honest with you every step of the way. Not treat you like a kid. - Are you sleeping with Myles? - What? No. Of course not. - You've got like this really girly flirty smile, "hey." - I like Myles. He treats me well, he appreciates me. And that makes me feel good. But that's all. - Dad was jealous. - Well, a little jealousy never hurt anyone. I know that you were hoping you would get us all out here and everything would go back to normal. But I don't wanna go back. I wanna move forward. And I'm not sure your dad is up for that. Hey, you wanna go for a walk or something? Maybe down to the cove? - Sure. - Great. Do you wanna come with us? - No, I'm just gonna hang out. - Alright. Well, you know where we'll be if you change your mind. [phone rings] [Melissa sighs] - Hey, Kristine, Dad's not here right now. But he promised no work over the holiday. Yeah, I'll tell him. [sighs] [playful orchestral music] A little jealousy never hurt anyone. - Oh, yeah! Come on, baby, come on! [laughs] - Hey hey, not so hard! You must be gentle, like with a woman. - Yeah. No, I know what I'm doing here. - Finesse, a little finesse. - Oh yeah, come on, baby! Come on! [screams] - You know, that's really good. You've gotta teach us that technique. - We'd get a lot of women like that. - Yeah. [sighs] [melancholic orchestral music] This was fun. This was lots of fun. Great day. - Great day, sure was. - Yeah. Mr. Jason. I was very sorry to hear about you and Miss Vicky. - Yeah, well... I don't get it. My wife and I are separated. - Oh, sorry to hear that. If you ask me, women are impossible to understand. [Rico chuckles] - Women aren't so difficult. All they need is a little respect, huh? Kindness, and a whole lotta love. - I wish it was that easy. I don't know, things just, um... Changed, that's all. The girl I feel in love with, she's gone. - How long you married? - 15 years. [Saul laughs] - That's longer than my first and second wife combined. - The girl you fell in love with, she may be gone, but the girl you share a life with, ah, she may be even better. - I think it might be too late. - No, it's never too late. - Jewelry. That's the answer. Why do you think I work so hard? - He owns a jewelry store. [Jason laughs] - I'm telling you, if it wasn't for the gifts I lavished on her, my third wife would have left me years earlier. - And she should have. [Jason laughs] - Oh. Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. - It's okay, I'm almost done. - You look great. - Oh, you think so? I, uh, didn't really pack anything appropriate for meeting clients. - You're meeting clients? - Looks like I might have a shot at designing their house. - [chuckles] Wow. [warm orchestral music] That's a pretty big deal, designing a house. - It's what I always thought I'd be doing. But I never got the chance before now. [sighs] If I don't blow it. - Hey, Vicky. Good luck. - Thank you. [thunder claps] [festive orchestral music] [thunder claps] Okay, I'll see you later, guys. - You're coming back, right? - Of course I am, I'll be back in a couple hours. - Yeah, we'll see. - Thanks for the support. [thunder claps] - Whoa, that's intense. [thunder claps] [rain splashes] [Victoria screams] [Victoria whines] [thunder claps] - Wow, kids, this looks like it's gonna be a big one. [Victoria moans and shivers] [Will and Melissa chuckle] [melancholic orchestral music] - Would somebody please get me a towel? [thunder claps] [Jason laughs] It just keeps getting better and better. [Jason laughs] Myles, hi, it's me. I'm so sorry. [sighs] [muffled background chatter] - Okay, Will, let's see it. - There we go. - What? - That's not a word. - [Will] It is too. - [Melissa] Namer? - [Will] Prince Namer is the king of Atlantis. - A superhero? You can't use superheros. - It's a word. - Will, no names. That's not allowed. You wanna join us? We have a spot. - No. It's okay. - Come on, Mom, play with us. - You might as well, you're stuck here anyway. [playful orchestral music] - Okay. I'm in. - Seven letters and you're up. - Hmm. Let's see how I do. Given my luck tonight, I'll probably get X, Q. [Will, Jason and Melissa laugh] Oh. You're all in big trouble. [sighs] You'll be sorry you asked me. Okay. [sighs] [fire crackles] Hey, Jason? [melancholic orchestral music] [Jason moans] [Jason laughs] [Jason grunts] - Woo! - Boy, it's a beautiful day. Oh, look at that. Sweetie, when we have kids, I want them to grow up coming here. - Yes! That'll be great. Our boys out there on the waves, learning how to surf. - But they'll be girls. Three of 'em, that way we can gang up on you. - Hey, as long as they're half as wonderful as you are, I don't care what they are. One more, one more, one more. - Okay. - [Jason] Beautiful, beautiful! - Alright, get over here, behind me. [Jason laughs] [both chuckle] [Victoria sniffs] [melancholic orchestral music] There you are. - Hey. Good morning to you. - You're awfully peppy this morning. - I thought I'd take a run. We used to take one every morning, remember? - I especially remember what we used to do when we got back from most of those runs. [warm piano music] - The kids have been bugging me to take them to that horse farm. I was thinking maybe we could do that together, if that's okay with you? - Sure. That would be nice. It is Christmas Eve after all, we should have some fun. [horse neighs] [Victoria and children giggle] - Beautiful day, huh? - Oh, how beautiful. [phone rings] [sighs] It's Myles. - There is just no getting away from work with you, huh? - I'll let it go to voicemail. - Well, that's if he could stand being away from you for a couple hours. - Jason, I've told you, it's just work. - That's what Myles tells you it is. - Is this really gonna work? - I hope so. But just in case. - If you would listen to me-- - [Jason] No, no, no, I do listen to you. - That's Dad's. - Duh. - What are you doing? - Giving Mom something to think about. - You don't wanna go there with me. - Fine. Fine, why don't we just all go back, huh? Why don't we just all leave? - Fine. But I'll tell you something, I'm not... [screams] - Mom! - Oh my god! [horse neighs] Oh my! - Vic! [Victoria screams] - Oh my god! - [Jason] Let me help you get outta there. [Victoria yelps] [horse neighs] [Victoria screams] - [laughs] Honey, are you okay? - No, don't touch me and no, I'm not okay! - Are you both hurt? - [laughs] We're fine, kids. We're fine. - I'm going home. Come on, kids. [horse neighs] - Well, well, thank you! [laughs] - [Rancher] See you next time! - [Jason] Well, it was a real fun day! Wasn't that fun, kids? [horse neighs] - [Melissa] Oh, Mom, it was just water, get over it. - [Will] It was so cool. - [Victoria] What a great way to spend Christmas Eve, huh? - Well, sweetie, look at it this way. We don't have to take a bath today. If you think about it, it's really kinda funny. - No, it wasn't. - Oh, hey, I made it. I'm sorry. Hi. - Kristine? - What is she doing here? - I don't know. - Your emails. You said we'd go for a swim before we worked. - What? - Oh. I'm sure you'll have a great time. - Oh. - [Jason] Kristine, why are you here? - The Bronski case, the new trial date. You told me to bring the files out here. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - But I left you a message, and then you emailed me. [playful orchestral music] - What have you done? [knocks] - Yeah? [peaceful piano music] - I'm sorry about that down there, I didn't, uh... - Doesn't matter. - Something's come up on the Bronski case that I have to deal with, so... We'll go into town, I can work there. - I can leave. - No, I'll go. Some Christmas, huh? [phone rings] [Victoria sighs] [phone rings] - Victoria Wright. Hi, Myles. Uh, sure, I could meet you there at, say... Three o'clock? Great. Tell them I look forward to meeting them. Bye. [melancholic orchestral music] - I'm sorry, I just thought that if Mom thought you were with someone else-- - Melissa. Honey, I know, I know you. You're a lot like me, you wanna, control things, try to make things happen just the way you want things to happen. But with this, you just gotta let it be. - But-- - No, no buts about it. This is between your mother and me and we will work it out. Just the two of us. - But what if you don't? - Well, then we're just gonna have to all move on. And we will love the both of you just as much as we ever have. That part will never change. Yes. Yes, next Monday would be fine. Jack, listen, thank you. You've really saved our neck on this one. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I'm sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve. You have a great holiday. [sighs] - Crisis averted? - Everything's taken care of. - That's good. I'm sorry about before at the house. - Oh, no, it's not your fault. - Okay. So, I thought you and your wife weren't together? - Well, we're not. It's, um... It's a whole messy story, but uh, the realization that we came to is that it's over. - That's a shame. [chuckles] I thought she'd forgiven you. - Forgiven me? [chuckles] What did I ever do that was wrong? - Are you kidding? You're impossible. You don't listen, all you do is yell "do this, do that!" You even forgot your own kids. I don't know how she put up with you for this long. I wouldn't have. - But you don't understand how much work it takes to support a family. - All I know is that it is Christmas Eve, and you are sitting here calling attorneys. What's the point in working so hard to support a family, if you don't ever get to enjoy them? - You know, you're not nearly as nice as you act. - Can you blame me? I'm stuck with my boss on Christmas Eve. Can I go now? - Merry Christmas! - Oh. Here she is. Victoria Wright, meet the Carrolls. - Victoria, we have heard so much about you. - [Husband] Myles says you're the best designer in his firm. - Well, thank you very much, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Well, let's have something special, shall we? - Great. [festive string music] [background chatter] - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. - Happy holidays. - Sorry, we're closing. Oh, uh... Jason. - Hey, Saul, I know you're closing and everything, but-- - Ah, don't tell me. You need something special. - Yeah, I do. I need something that, I need something that says, "forgive me, I've been a jerk." Something that says, "I don't wanna lose you and what was I thinking and maybe "we can work it out if you just give me one more chance." - That's all? - Yeah. - Okay dokey! - This one? - Oh, yeah. - It's perfect. Saul. This time, I'm gonna get it right. - So, based on what Myles has told me, I think we ought to just go with the faux finish in the master. - Sounds pretty good to me. - How's this one, sir? - Oh yeah, that looks perfect. Can we have it with our meal? - I'll chill for you now, sir. - I'll take care of this, we'll see you at the table. - Great. - Thank you. - Myles, I'm sorry, but I think I'm gonna skip dinner. - But it's going so well. - I know and that's great, it's just that, it's Christmas Eve, and I need to be with my family. - Well, if that's what you need to do. You know... To get ahead sometimes, Vicky, you have to make certain sacrifices. [Jason sighs] [peaceful orchestral music] [Jason chuckles] - Yes. [keys jingle] Hey. - Hi. - I, uh, needed to talk to you. It seems like I've been, um... You goin' somewhere? - Oh, just coming back. Myles called after you left. - Oh. - He wanted me to meet the Carrolls, about designing their house. - Did it go well? - I don't know. We'll see. - Mom, help! - Melissa? - It's Will! We were riding on the trails and, and... - And what? Where is he? - I don't know, he split off from me at some point, and I went looking for him and all I found was his bike! - Okay, alright, come on, come on. Come on, let's take the car! [suspenseful music] Will! - Will! - Will! - Will? - You guys stay here. Will! Will! Will! - I swear I don't know what happened. - [Jason] Will! - [Will] Daddy! - I've found him! I'm comin'. I'm comin' to get you, sweetie. Here's daddy. - Do you have him? - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Is he okay? - Yeah! Get this off you. [grunts] Okay, come on. Come on, let's go see mommy. I got you, bud. [warm orchestral music] Okay, I got ya. [Melissa sobs] - It's okay. It's all gonna be okay. See? He's here. He's here. - Yes. - Oh, my baby. Let me see you. Oh, you must have been so scared. - Sorry, Dad. - What were you two thinking, going off like that? - Well, you were both so busy working, we just wanted to do something. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. [melancholic orchestral music] - Oh, sweetie. Come here. It's okay. You didn't say anything wrong. You're right. So, we're all very clear? Nobody takes off without Mom and Dad knowing about it. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Don't ever scare us like that again. - I'm fine. - Mom? I'm sorry, about everything. - Melissa, you have nothing to be sorry about. I love you both so much. More than you'll ever know. Okay, go to sleep. Presents in the morning. - You were right. - About what? - This is the worst Christmas ever. [sighs] [warm piano music] - Quite a day. - I just keep thinking, what if? Look at us. Kids. It's weird, when I look at that, I can remember it like it was yesterday. At the same time it seems like it's a million years ago. I don't even know who that guy is. - He's kinda cute. - You think? - I miss him. - I'm sorry I haven't been the kind of husband you needed me to be. - You know, you always supported the family, Jason. - But I didn't take care of you. - It's not that simple. It's really not about blame. Which one of us is right and which one of us is wrong. We just grew apart. - I can change. You know, if... If you need to work, I-- - It's not about work either. Work was just something to do. You know, work made me feel really good about myself. The real problem... The real problem was that you didn't love me anymore, and when you stopped loving me, I stopped loving me too. I've been feeling really good about myself again for the last few months and I don't wanna lose that. Standing there today, the thought of losing Will. [Jason chuckles] - I've never been so scared in my life. - The way we've been acting lately, it's just not fair to the kids. Hearing us fight and not knowing what's gonna happen. And us being too busy for them. - You're right. You're right. - So I think when we get home, that we ought to make the separation... More formal. More permanent. - Is that what you believe is right for the kids? - I just... I just think that we can't keep doing this anymore. It's too hard on everybody. [festive orchestral music] - Cool! I saw this on TV! [Victoria chuckles] - Oh my god, Mom, it's gorgeous! - I thought it looked like you. - Dad, this one's from you. Yes! The Herculaneum action figure I wanted. Thanks, Dad. - No problem, champ. - Where does Rico live anyway? - Oh, close to those trails up in the hills outside of town. I've never been there, but he left directions. - Who's gonna be there? - He said lots of people. Probably the locals that work in town. - Is he gonna give out presents? - Haven't you gotten enough? - You can never have too much loot! - [Victoria] There should be a road right up here. There, I think that's it. - [Jason] Are you sure? - [Victoria] That's what it says. - Whoa, this is where our caretaker lives? [Jason chuckles] - Let's go. [upbeat music] [background chatter] - Hey! Who wants Christmas cheer? - Mom, look at the flowers. - I'll take that for you. - Hey, Jason, you made it! - Hey, Saul. This is my family, everybody, this is Saul. He and I went fishing together yesterday. - It's a pleasure. Hey, they just started a limbo contest over there. First prize, new iPod. [Jason chuckles] [Victoria gasps] - Oh, iPod! - Rico knows how to throw a party, huh? - This is really his place? - [chuckles] You didn't know, did ya? All those places Rico takes care of down on the beach, by yours, most of them he owns. He bought them years ago, before they were worth much. And look at him now. Come on, he's cooking up the salmon. It's so delicious it'll drive you meshuganah, come on. [Victoria chuckles] - Something else, huh? - [Woman] Whoa, limbo! - [Waitress] Would you like an appetizer? - On, no thanks. [Rico sniffs] - Ah, Miss Vicky! [chuckles] You finally made it. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, and it shall be. [chuckles] - Nice little place you have here. - Oh, thank you. A few wise investments here and there, and when the real estate of California went zoop, so did my bank account. [chuckles] - Why didn't you ever say anything? - I like being a caretaker, Miss Vicky, it's what I do. It's who I am. And this, ah, this is me too. [chuckles] I rather like it, don't you? - So, your perfect gift, it did the trick? - I don't know yet. I haven't had a chance to give it to her. I just hope it's not too late. - Oh, it's only too late if you give up. Three times I asked my fourth wife to marry me. Every time she said "no." Did I give up? No. I did not. - Well, what happened to that one? - Oh, she makes me the happiest old man on the beach. - [Will] Do you have another plan? - No more plans. - What do you mean? We have to do something. - We gave it our best shot, not much more we can do. - Hello, hello! [laughs] May I have your attention, please. I am going to make a little speech. Merry Christmas to everybody, happy Hanukkah and, [speaks foreign language] or whatever you want to celebrate. You know, this beach has been my home for a very long time. I've watched it grow and change in ways that I could never imagine. Some are good, but some are bad and difficult and disappointing. But that's all it is, isn't it? The yin, yang, with the good and the bad, all hand in hand. Now someone said to me the other day that living on the beach is some kind of a magic. But let me tell you, this magic didn't just happen. This magic is here because we make it happen. You know, we change and we grow, but we are always here to give it life. To nurture the parts of it that we love the most. So, ladies and gentlemen, I wanna make a toast to all of you. All of you who love this beach as much as I do. And because of you, there is magic here. [speaks foreign language] That means "all Chinese are very long-winded." [guests laugh] - Cheers, cheers! - Do you like that? [laughs] Oh, now please, last thing, eat. Everybody eat, I hate leftovers, okay? Music! [guests applaud and cheer] [upbeat music] - Hey, Vicky. I was wondering if you'd be here. - Myles. - [Myles] Look, I feel really bad about the way things ended last night, no, I mean it. I just, I may have been a bit hasty in the things that I said and I just, please, please, I just wanted to-- - Myles, excuse me, I have to go. - But, I-- - And just so we're clear, I wanna be a designer, and I'm going to be a damn good one. And I'm even willing to make sacrifices, if that's what it takes. But my family won't be one of them. Not ever. - What's going on? - I don't know, but it looks bad. - Jason? [sighs] [melancholic piano music] Jason. I want it all. I wanna have a family and I wanna do something that I really care about that challenges me. And I wanna spend my life with the man that I love. Is that too much to hope for? - No. - I'm sorry if it seems selfish, but I do, I want it all. - You deserve it all. [Victoria chuckles] [warm orchestral music] [Victoria and Jason chuckle] - I'm the luckiest person in the world. - Second luckiest. [Jason and Victoria chuckle] - Oh. Did you see that? Come here. - I love you so much, Melissa. [chuckles] [upbeat music] - This is so great. - It's weird, none of this would have happened if the vacation rental hadn't gotten canceled. - Yeah. About that. You see, they didn't exactly cancel on their own. - You little sneak! And you think I'm devious. - We're raising monsters. I can't believe you. Well, I had a suspicion. - Vicky. The Carrolls are here, you should come and say hello. - Oh. - Well I mean, if you're gonna be designing their new house, you wanna get to know them a little better, right? Bring Jason and the kids along. Come on, I'm sure they'd love to meet them. [Victoria laughs] - [Victoria] Hey. - Yeah. [bright orchestral music] [Victoria and Jason chuckle] [peaceful orchestral music]
