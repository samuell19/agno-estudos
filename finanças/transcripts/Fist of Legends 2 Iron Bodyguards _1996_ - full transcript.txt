[People Chattering] You must declare all items. Undeclared items will be confiscated. Cho, declare the ginseng to customs. Why, Pop? They make us pay 50 bucks in duty. I know. What ifI just hide it in my pants? They'll never know. Brilliant, Fei-Hong. Betteryet, why don't we have the master hold onto it? They'll never search him because he's too respectable. What doyou think? Ha ha ha! Very good idea. You're hopeless-- both ofyou. Bad idea. I'll not hear any more ofyour nonsense. I just don't understand whywe have to pay duties on everything we buy. I don't care whatyou say. Just listen to me. Avoid trouble. Pay the duties, that's it. I know best. [Honks Horn] [Car Honks Horn] Soldier: Back, back. Back. Make way. Let the ambassador through. What's going on? Now watch it. It's the ambassador and he deserves respect. He's treated like royalty. He doesn't have to pay any duties. How about that one? Wow. He's a lucky one. Man:: Nopushing: Don'tpush: Everybodyback: Let thesepeople through! Ay! [Crowd Chatters] Oh, no. Hey, areyou all right? Let's go. Shh, shh, shh, shh. What happened? Shut up. Someone push him. Huh? Please, sir, I apologize. Listen, Fei-Hong. Fei-Hong, why did you give him our ginseng? We don't have to pay tax. Once we get on the train, I'll look for the box. Ah, what a terrific idea. What's that? You could throw me down again and I'll hide some more. Here I go. Here I go. Aah! Cho:: Ooh: He must've tripped. Look atyou. You're so clumsy. Come on, get up. File in! [Yelling] Wow, what a crowd. Why don'tyou go get a seat and I'll pay the taxes. All right, son. I'll seeyou on board. Ifyou have nothing to declare, begin boarding right now. [Yelling] Cho:: Here, Fei-Hong, take this: Got it. Come on. Fei-Hong, great. Wong::Easy, easy: Be careful. You'll crush everything. Wong:: That'sgood: Hold it. Hey, where areyou going? Stop! Come back! Fei-Hong! Wong:: Fei-Hong, lethimgo! Fei-Hong, forget about him! Come back here. Come back. Fei-Hong, now, let me remind you. A hero lives but a few seconds. A master holds onto his life. But he stoleyourwallet. And I took it back. That's not the issue. The point is, the stronger man knows... It's more important to forgive than it is to fight. That's right. What was I thinking? Uhh. Your turn. How about this? Hey, you know better than that. But there's no other move. Try it again. Try it again. Hey, look at the white crane. Wow. Haveyou ever seen one like that? It's still your play. Come on. Can we start over? You still have a chance. Where? I don't see it. It'snotfair: Youalways win: Ready? Oh, God! Cho::Damnit! Uhh... Areyou OK? Oh... I bet that hurt. I'm sorry, sir. - Wong::Is thisyours? - I'm afraidso: Be more careful. Shh. Yes, sir. Ready? Ready. Wong:: Fei-Hong, what's this? We call it cheating.

Father, forget about this. Let me go find something you're really going to like. Ha ha. I don't think I'm ready to eat, but I thankyou. Come on, how about a nice roasted chicken? We can find him one. How about it, huh? Look, I can seeyou two want to look around a bit. It's OK. I'll be fine here. - Go on. - Come on. [People Chattering] Wong: Hey... you two stay out oftrouble, you hear me? You make sure you come right back. [Chickens Clucking] Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry, sorry. [Various Animal Noises] God, doyou believe the smell ofthis place? I think I'm going to be sick. God. Hey, this way. [Classical Music Playing] Wow. The vegetation's much nicer. Yes, I see. It's making me hungry. Maybe we could grab a roll. Hey! What areyou doing here? - Nothing. - Nothing. You thinkyou have reservations? Yeah, yeah, we do. Go on back. Check inside. I've had enough. Go on. One more time, and you're offthe train. So what do we do now? I got an idea.

I'm not a traitor, you hear me? You-- Then what are we fighting about? Don't play games. You hit me. Yaah! Where'd he go? Hey! Hmm. Back again? Why don'tyou give up? Oh, no, old man. Apologize. What did you say? How dareyou call me a traitor. [Sighs] OK. Sorry. Fine, but I still oweyou one. Here. Hey, show respect. Stand still. Respect toyou? You must be kidding me. Let's make this fair. Huhh. Ready? Ah, drunken boxing. That's right. I'm the master. You think so? Again. Come on. - Let's go. - You come. You know... a kid likeyou isn't worth my time. I showyou! Tiger Slash At Bear! Quail! Huh? What doyou call that one? Ha. It's called Turtle Holding Wild Bear. Catch the Bouquet! Eagle Catch the Rabbit! Down the Hatch! - Hmm. - Drunk Plays the Flute? * Da da da da da da da * Fei-Hong:: **Lala la la la la la** **Deela da da la la la la la la--** Uhh. And this one? [Sheep Baas] Nursing a Hangover. OK... stand up. Your kung fu is pretty good. Young man, you're not too bad yourself, but that drunken boxing wasn't-- [Train Whistle Blows] Impressed? Basically, it's slow, and you have no power. It's pathetic. What? I can defeat any kung fu. I showyou power. That's nice, butyou're out oftime. Time? I'm young and strong. I've got lots oftime. Butyour train's leaving over there. Nice try, old man, but nowyou're going to get it. Ay. All right, kid. Come back here! [Gasps] Oh, no, the train! [Train Whistle Blows] [People Chattering] Fei-Hong: Wait for me!

It is such an insult. Yeah. Put that away. Doyou all realize what this means? They certainlywon't buy the rest ofthe shipment without it. You know, I'm truly astounded at the incompetence ofall ofyou. You severely damaged my reputation with the British Museum ofArt. They've asked me to deliver thejade seal ofthe emperor, and I have every intention offulfilling that request. I don't care howyou do it. I want it back. Both: Yes, sir. We thinkwe know who the thiefis, sir. Get him. Yes, sir. John... we're having a bit oftrouble with the workers at the steel factory. I trustyou'll deal with it. Ofcourse, sir.

I was in the kitchen. Uhh. Unh. Stand back. Here. Miss me? Wong:: Whatareyouall doing? Oh, it's you. I'm so glad you're home. How was your trip? Is everything all right? Ling::Allright? Um...oh. Hmm. More mah-jongg? [Whispering] Quiet! How many times have I asked you not to see patients while I'm away? You know it's illegal. Oh, now, I know I'm not supposed to, and I tried to wait, but I had no idea when you would return. Besides, ifyou were me, I knowyou would've done the same thing. [Giggling] Wow. I betyou won a lot. [Whispering] Not now. Perhaps I should examine them. Uh, oh, it's a female problem. I can handle it. Fei-Hong, would you prepare my altar for me? All right. You should wash your hands. [Women Giggle] Stop it. We'll need the altar ladder over here, please. Did you remember to water the plants? - Oh, yes. - Excellent. Thankyou. Fei-Hong:: Hey, Mom, whosemoney? [All Gasp] Wow. - Son. - Huh? What was that? I didn't hear anything. Wong:: Thealtar: Hmm. Oh, thanks for coming. My share. Gimme. [All Talking At Once] Go. Go. Hey... show a little respect. Now, rememberyour treatment next Friday, ladies. Bring money. Ha ha ha. Hello, Mrs. Wong. How areyou? Has MasterWong returned? Yes. He's inside. Any news about my ginseng? Did he get it? Let's ask him. Come in. Oh, thankyou. Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng. Ah, Mr. Chan, I'm-- Why areyou here so soon? Fei-Hong. - The ginseng's in the back. - I know. - Let me get it. - Go on. It's beautiful. I broughtyou a whole root. Wait till you see it. It'sjust in back. Some tea? Ah, you are so kind. Yes. Please have a seat. I'll be right back. Thankyou. I'm getting out ofhere. Where areyou going? You got to help me out. When the master finds out, he'll kill me. He will not. Ling::Fei-Hong: What areyou doing? Stepma, come here. Fei-Hong:: Idon'tknow what to do: We're in such trouble. I lost the ginseng on the train. What? What did you do now? What'd she say? OK, OK, OK. Shh. Please. You got to help us out. Wong::Fei-Hong! Yes, Dad! Youjust go out and serve him tea. I'll think ofsomething. I'll leave it up toyou two. Coming! Oh, madam, what should we do about this? You see that door behind me? You mean... - In the cabinet. - Sure. - There's a black box. - Oh, yeah? Look inside it. Ah, another ginseng. I can't believe it! Strychnine. - What for? - Foryou. Oh, no, madam, please don't tease me this way! Who's teasing? I haveyour tea, Mr. Chan. Thankyou very much, son. Enjoy it. [Gasps] Go, go. Father, you must be very hot. - Let me helpyou. - Mr. Chan. Hmm? Wow. It's real. Now, Mr. Chan, I knowyou have never seen a specimen as beautiful as this, haveyou? Oh, and let me tell you-- wait till you see what happens toyou when you take it. Why, women won't believe the difference in your performance, and you will owe it all to the master. What areyou doing with that rutabaga? Fei-Hong: Ohh. Rutabaga? This is a rutabaga? You mean it isn't ginseng? - No. - Silly ofme. Ofcourse it isn't ginseng. What I meant to tell you was thatyoushould stayaway from rutabagas-- especiallybig rutabagas like this one-- whileyou're takingginseng: It causes gas and neutralizes the effect or something like that. Excuse me. Mr. Chan... I'm glad she remembered to tell you about that. You know, most people don't realize that when you use ginseng you should avoid the use ofrutabaga, because they're not a good mix. Rutabaga, shmutabaga. Stop that, Fei-Hong! Hi. Back so soon? Oh, Lord. Now what? Good luck, now. You think this looks like ginseng? Oh, yeah, it looksjust like it. Where did you find it? Father's bonsai tree. What a great idea. Just blame it on Cho. - OK. - Aah! I'll try to keep your father distracted. [Sighs] What doyou think ofthis? Boy, that looks great. Great. I'm a genius. Excuse me. May I have a word? Just a second. Ofcourse. I can wait. What is it, dear? - Come. - What? Come on. Just one minute. Can't this wait? I'm busy right now. I'm sorry. I couldn't wait anylongerto tellyou: Fei-Hong is all grown up now. Someday, he will leave our house. - What? - Oh, you know... how cute he was when he was little. Chan:: But whyisit wet? Let me tell you. I'm glad you asked. Because it wasjust picked this morning. You're really going to enjoy the potency ofthis one. It's really powerful. Youjust need a little bit. A little brother around here could take his place. We can talk about this later. Don't be rude. Please, or I will never forgiveyou. You shouldn't talk that way to me. Well, you never let me talk. Honey, not now. Mr. Chan-- Don'tyou turn your back on me. OK. Fold it up tight to keep it nice and fresh and keep it close toyour heart-- Like that. Rememberwhat I told you and have a nice day. Right. Yes. I really do think we need to talk about this now. MasterWong? Thanks for the ginseng. Ah. Everything is all right? Just fine. - I'll keep it inside. - He liked it. Let me seeyou out. Let Fei-Hong do it. I can showyou. Please, this way. - Bye-bye, now. - Good-bye, Mr. Chan. Anyway, as I was saying before Mr: Chaninterruptedus, it's timeyou thoughtabout this: I don't know what you're trying to tell me. Fei-Hong:: Mother, Mr: Chan'sgone: Oh, thank God. What's this all about? Look, ifyou don't want to talk about this right now, I understand. You've had a really long trip, and you should get some rest. Come on. Let's sit down. Yes, Father. Please take a rest. It's a good idea. I better start taking better care ofmyself. I need to realize I'm not getting anyyounger. Well? Why doyou make that look? Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree. Don't be silly. Throw the pot away. That's not all. What? What happens when Mr. Chan drinks the tea made from those roots? Ho ho ho! So he will get a little dizzy. Ling::He'sgoing tohave the time ofhis life: I wish I could say the same. Man::Allright, allright: That'sitforme: Seeyou tomorrow. Hey, thanks for bringing it down. Man::Ho Sang, she's cooling down: Can you give me some more fire? Just give me one minute. Stand back. That was great. Thanks for the light. Almost quitting time. After this, I ought to. [Men Shouting] That's it! Seeyou tomorrow. Hey! Get them back to work. But why? Go! I'm the new foreman here. Now ring the bell. Go on. Yes, sir. [Bell Ringing] [Men Talking] Hey, Ho Sang, what the hell you doing now? Yeah, what areyou, out ofyour mind? Sorry. I wasjust told that we have a new foreman here. New foreman? Well... we seem to have fallen behind this month, so everybodyworks the night shift for one month. What? Extra shifts? [Men Protest] Hey, hold on. So, let's saywe work all those overtime hours foryou... then we need overtime pay. [Men Agree] Quiet. You give us no choice. You eitherwork the overtime, orwe close the steel mill down, and you'll all be withoutjobs. Now, you can take it or leave it. Mr. Smith, you can't blackmail us anymore. We worked hard foryou, and now we've had enough! We quit! [Men Yell In Agreement] Hold it! Nobody is to leave. You'll stay and work. Doyou understand that? You can take myjob, butyou can't run my life! You thinkyou can make us? Whoyou thinkyou are? Let's go! Don't move! You're in ourway! All ofyou, right now! Get back to work! [Men Yell] Strike breaker!

[Yawns] It's bloody impossible to sleep with all this noise. Why don't wejust buy it and have it bulldozed? You know that we've been through this before. Mr. Wong refuses to sell. It's ruining my life, so why don'tyou go and do something about it? Yes, sir. [InstructorAnd Men Shouting] [People Chattering] Man: I'll catch you later! Hey, Fun, you're working too hard. You need husband to run that snake stand, huh? Perfectjob for me, huh? Tsan::Hahahaha! A husband, huh? Yeah. I betyou'd be running away from these snakes all day. Come on, now. Whywould I want to pay some lazy man when I can do it better, huh? You know, you make good point. But seriously now, Fun, you know, you don't have man around, so I worry about your safety. Hey, Fun, I've been thinking-- Let me teach you kung fu. How about drunken boxing? Where did you get that idea? No one does that. Ifyou reallywant to fight, I teach you the Choy Li Fu boxing style. Oh, wise man speak. Whatyou looking at? Get back to work. We've got customers waiting. They need the help now. Woman:: Yellowtail! Yellowtail? OK. Drunken boxing. What does she know anyway?

How about I bone it foryou, eh? Oh, no. That's all right. How about laterwith that? Fun:: We're discussing drunkenboxing: Fei-Hong, when doyou think you could teach me? Anytime would be fine. Youjust let me know. Tsan::Fun, youneed realinstructor to learn how to fight. Maybe Chang Tsan can giveyou a lesson. He doesn't teach the style I like. It's for fighting. Drunken masterjust for show. Tsan:: Youcannot win Fiight that way: Forget him. He'sjealous. I likeyour style. Fei-Hong, time to admit it. Your drunken boxing is no match for Choy Li Fu. Isn't that right? You agree? Men: Yeah! Right! That's right. Man:: Mastermuchbetter: Man::Heknows: Depends on who's fighting. What doyou say to a challenge, then? Out ofmyway. My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing. And ifI lose, you can haveyour fish and anything elseyou want no charge, on me. Listen... you can learn from Fei-Hong. I don't need your help. I appreciate the offer, but there's too many people here, and somebody could get hurt. No way, Fei-Hong. You're going to fight this time. Attention, everybody! Listen! I'm Chang Tsan, and this is Wong Fei-Hong. It's your lucky day. I have challenged him to a fight. Come on. I'll hold this. Remember, it's an exhibition match, so go on. Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!

You knowyour father will kill you ifhe hears about it. Fei-Hong:: Howcan Ireplace theginseng? Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how. But, why? We'll be in big trouble if Mr. Chan decides to brew that tree root. You would do that? Just remember, you owe me one. Yeah. Hey, that's the guy we're looking for. Stay close to him while I go and get the boss, OK? Yes, sir. Woman::Stophere: Ah, OK, here's the money. I'm sure they're high quality. She got them from her husband. Look, I'm late already. Let's go, OK? So, was the drought very serious? In that province, rice and grain were scarce before there was a drought. With no rainfall, there will be no harvest, and that is serious. We must act now. It's so bad. They so poor that some families have to share a single pair ofpants. Wow. Who gets to wear them? Ifyou havejob, you wear the pants. Oh, wow. Hello. Sorry I'm late.

It's been called to our attention that MasterWong needs us to lend him some money. Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me. I'm sure I speak for everyone. We'll just take up a collection. Did you hearwhat I said? I don't personally need any ofyour money. It's for the drought victims. Butyourwife-- Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of. This could happen toyou. I say if Mr. Wong needs money... Nothing right now. You sure? You better not have said anything, you understand? I won't tell a soul. Besides, she's the one that talks a lot. Likeyou don't? How dareyou say that? I only told my sister-- Qu doesn't even know I came here. Whoa, ladies, somebody has been talking. They always lie to me. Look at their faces. Now, that's enough. Second Woman: Can't wejust take a look? Let's see. There. Hey, careful! Woman:: Oh, sobeautiful: [Women Chattering] [All Gasp] Oh, don't handle it like that. And I'm only borrowing the money.

Why didn'tyou tell us Po Chi Lam needed more money? We would have helped you. You know we're all friends here. No. The school doesn't need money. Here, you can take charge ofthe funds we raised. [Gurgling] Stop that! Fei-Hong! - Hi. - Hello, Madam Wong. I said stop it! No, please, MasterWong, don't hurt him! He's drunk! Mom, fetch me another bottle. Wong:: Gohomenow! Now! Yes, dear. Do as he says. All right. Seeyou. * Go home now, Daddy* Go on. Follow him! Losers. You didn't do any better. And what wereyou trying to do? You've ruined the school's reputation! They thinkwe're broke! And you, you idiot, what have I told you about drunken boxing and fighting in the streets? Now, tell me, is everything here so bad you have to sell your diamonds? Come on! Doyou really think I would have sold something that's precious to us? I would never! Don't lie to me! How much money did you lose playing mah-jongg? Well, how much? I always win at mah-jongg. You don't know what you're talking about. Besides, who areyou going to believe, me or friends? Stepma, I believeyou. Shut up! Did you hearwhat I told you? Shut up! You disobeyed me! I said absolutely no fighting and no drinking. And above all, no drunken boxing! [Hiccup] You even fought with me, your own father! Youdisgraced your familyname! Wait! Wait! Hold on! Would you stop hitting him? He wasjust defending me! They tried to break myjaw. I guess that's something you don't care about. Damn you, woman! It was forbidden! They could have killed him. Don'tyou care about that? Oh, sure. Like it matters. You're beating him worse than those guys ever did. You're driving me insane! I can't believe this! Wong:: What's this? Cho:: Oh, myGod! [Gasps] What has happened to my 300-year-old bonsai? Damn it! I forgot to throw it out! Mr. Cho! Aah! What went wrong? Wong:: Youknowthis garden isyourresponsibility andIexpectananswer! Well? Just hold on! You shouldn't blame everything on him that way, because I was actually the one who did it. I was practicing my kung fu and then I tripped over that statue right over there. Luckily, the tree was there to grab. God only knows, I could have gotten killed, but I see now you don't care. Oh, well. You know that's not it, Ling. I am so sick and tired ofyour deception! Ifyou're going to hit me,just go on. You know, that's not a bad idea. Wong::It's time youshowedmerespect: [Sobbing] That's not gonna work this time! [Sobbing] You've been hurting me so I won't cause any more trouble. You're driving me out ofmy mind! Aah! Hit me! Hit me all right! Over the head! Kill me! Kill me and the little one inside me! Little one? Is that so? We're going to have a baby? [Gagging] Wong:: Why didn'tyou tellme? - Never! - Come inside. You told me to get on my knees, so here I am! On my knees! It doesn't matter ifI'm pregnant! Mom has a little baby! I apologize. I wouldn't hityou. Get away! You said enough! Ling, no! You will hurt the baby! - Then put me down! - OK. Leave me alone, I said! No! You have to stop this! All right, I will. Areyou all right? There's no way I'll forgiveyou! What areyou doing? This is all my fault. Please be careful. Get Madam a chair! Quickly! Wong:: Whatareyou waiting for? I'm begging you, Ling. Sit over there, you'll be all right. - Aah! - Ling! Oh! Sorry. [Coughs] Ling, I'm so sorry. How dareyou?! Oh, it was an accident, Ling. Let me helpyou. You did it on purpose. Now, ofcourse I didn't. Don't lie. Haven'tyou done enough? Is the baby all right? Stop it! Eee. Ooh. Ugh. It's fine. Wong:: Good: Areyoucomfortable? MasterWong, Mrs. Chan is here. She has a bit ofa problem. You stay right here. I'll be right back. Congratulations, Father. I'm really proud ofyou. Thankyou. Ah, Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure. Dr. Wong, uh, this really isn't ginseng. I showed it to another doctor and he says it's poisonous. Now, I'm not sure whereyou got it, butyou've surely been misled. It has made my husband deathly ill. Mrs: Chan:: Thank Godhe onlybrewedhalfofit: You owe me, and you're going to have to take the blame for this mess. Now! Mm-hmm. Forgive me. Uncle Ho, get the snake extract. I can assureyou he will recover ifyou give him this. Ah, Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful. I promise I won't tell anyone. It must have been a mistake. Good day, madam. Mrs: Chan:: Goodday: Wong:: Well? Mmm. Get over here, Cho! What's this? He did it! Fei-Hong! [Fei-Hong Laughs] [Growls] How could you do such a thing? Areyou out ofyour mind? [Hiccup] You are destroying my reputation! Hereyou go, Father. You dropped your bonsai tree. That's it! I'm gonna kill you! Ruin me! Drunk! Wait, Wong, don't! Aah! Hurt my friends! That's it! Just listen! It was stolen offthe train and he couldn't get it back! Oh, shit. What am I saying? See, he was trying to saveyou some tax. How would he have known the ginseng would be stolen? The ginseng was stolen? Even so, he still lied to me! No! Not acceptable! You shouldn't defend him! He's a thiefand a drunk. Just stay out ofit! I'm thirsty. Oh, yeah? You like some wine? Just stay right there. [Sloshing] I'll giveyou some wine. Come on, open up. Come on, drink! Ling:: Stopit, Wong!Stop! Nomore! Whatareyoudoing? Aaah! [Echoing] You're going to fight me now? I disown you! You are not my son! Now, get out! You better do as I say! Get out! Come on! Get out ofhere! Stop it! That's enough! Ling:: You'regoing tokillhim! That's enough, Wong! Fei-Hong! Fei-Hong! Ling:: Please, don't!Please! You're killing him, Wong, can'tyou see? I don't care! I want him out! Father! Up! Get out ofhere! Aah! [Yelling] That was self-defense! He didn't mean to do it! Ling:: Tellyour father you'resorry! Out! Now! Fei-Hong! Come back! After him, Cho! Don't let him go! Cho! That way. Oh, yes. Man:: Howmanyyou want? Woman::Excuseme, sir: Where can IFindtheherbalshop? Right down on left. Woman: Thankyou. Hereyou go. Hello. Beer, please. Yes, sir. Very good, sir. I've never seen you drink so much. You knowyour father's going to be very angrywith you, Fei-Hong. Let's not talk about this. Bring me another drink. Keep it coming. Ah, no way. That's it for tonight. Ahh. Excuse me, miss? I want a song here. Something I should sing? The Ocean's Crying, but I sing it. You play for me now? OK. [Playing Music] Mmm. **Iamsosentdown** [Laughs] **I wassohappyandnow** **I'm allalone withnohome** ** Whatcan Ido?** **Ifnotforthe wine** **I'dbehurting all the time** **IfonlyIcouldgohome** **Father, listen tomenow** ** Whatcan Ido tomakeitup** ** Tomakeyouproud** **Makeyouproud** **Ionly triedtohelp** ** When Isaw thebonsaitree** **I thought I wassosmart** ** Why didyou:::** There he is, right over there. He doesn't look so bad. Oh, yes, he is. He's real tough. A fighter. Well, let'sjust see about this. **Istillloveyou** **Nomatter whatyou--** Party's over. I suggestyou go. Fei-Hong:: **Nomatter whatyoudo** What? You stop that! Fei-Hong:: **Loveyou** You shut up! Listen to me! John:: Therestofyou, go onhome! Go on!Getoutofhere! Yeah. You gotta leave. Go on. Move! Man: Let's get out ofthe way. What happened to the music? - Oh! - Aah! [Giggling] Areyou the drunken boxer? Sure. I'm pretty drunk, but I don't know about boxing. Man: He'sjust faking. Hyah! [Groaning] John:: Come on: What's thematter withyou? GetupandFiightme! That's Fei-Hong. Out ofmyway! What areyou doing? Hey. It's none of your goddamn business. Aah! [Men Shouting] Get him out! What's going on? Is this some kind ofjoke? No! You should have seen him! He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone. John::I'llstophim: [Groans] Man:: We Finishedhim! Ha ha! Whyyou kick me? Look atyou. Get up and fight me! Come on! Get this drunk out ofmy sight! Go! Go on! Kill him! No, wait. Notyet. Don't kill him, teach him a lesson. Man::Allright, you'vehaditnow: Man:: Careful, he's tricky! [Low Chatter] Fei-Hong. He's hurt bad, yeah. Girl: Come. Ooh, that's bad. Let's go. Oh, God. Fei-Hong! Man: Up there! Wang! Woman:: Gethim! Cuthim down! Fei-Hong, don't be ashamed. When we were kids, we used to go naked all the time. I should have found you sooner. You'll be OK. Just give it some time. [Fei-Hong Sniffing] By the way... I have some good news, too. Just listen to me. Guess what. Everywoman in town wants to beyourwife. It's the truth. Hey, all right. Come on. Dryyour eyes. Father... I know. I have a good reason to forbid drunken boxing. Those who practice it frequently wind up as alcoholics. Not ifone uses restraint and self-discipline. But that's more difficult than you might think. Wong::It's true thatalcohol canmake thebodyloose anditspain thresholdhigher, butit's diffiicult to drink theproperamount: Many drunkenboxers becomenothingmore than drunken fools: The odds ofbringing shameanddisgrace upon oneselfandone's family isjust toogreat: It also reminds me there is an ancient proverb that equates the drinking ofalcohol with water-- '' Boats can foat on water,'' or so it says, ''but they can sink in it, too.'' Now, that's a profound lesson. I have only one question. What? Whose boat are we talking about? [Chuckles] I will never drink again. Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong. I'm glad to see thatyou're OK now. Come on, let's get up and thank all your friends here for helping you. Go on. Ho Sang:: Fei-Hong, you OK? Thankyou. You OK? You should-- Tsan::Don'tevergive up: You'llbebetternow: Everybodymakesmistakes: How's the baby today? He'sjust fine. Let him be. Oh. All right. Sorry, we are closed now. Where's Fei-Hong? Excuse me? Is he here? He might be. What for? It's private. May I come in? Well, in that case... Ling:: Iknow whosentyou: What was that for? Keepyour distance. That's enough. I wantyou to leave. Hmm. You know, you're not bad. Huh? It's you! You! Fei-Hong, hold him for me! Unh! [Whines] Help. Father, help! - Help him! - Wong:: That's enough! Hurting me! Aah! Fei-Hong, areyou all right? Yeah, I wasjust pretending. Fei-Hong, who is that? Hey! Fei-Hong, hold it! We haveyou surrounded! I'm talking toyou. Yeah. Would you stop? Me? Wong::Please, sir, Ihopeyoucan forgive us: I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologize. You are very famous. Meeting you is an honor. I am Fu Wen-Chi. Fu Wen-Chi? Our most decorated Manchu officer. Is it true? Yes, it is. It's an honor. Welcome. - Right this way. - Thankyou. Good evening. I guess that man is someone important. Trust me, ifhe was important, he wouldn't be hitting women, would he? Oh. Think about it. What? Keep searching. We have to find it. Look in the parlor when you're done. Yes, ma'am. You have no idea whereyou left it? No, I don't. Where could it be? Cho might know. [Gasps] Hey! Something's wrong? Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it. She's quite a handful. Oh, think I'll get some ice. Cho, where's thejade box I had? What? Where did you put it? I don't know. What is that? Ground garlic. I mean there in your hand. We found it! Fei-Hong, where areyou going? - Mom! - I'm not finished with that. Fu:: Whenyousurprisedme in thebaggage car, I was trying toget back thejadeseal thatAmbassadorMorley hadstolen: I woundup with yourginseng instead: Tell me something, there must be a hundred jade seals in our museum. Is this one so special? Fei-Hong, they all are special. Think about this. Today they plunder a seal. It seems small. Tomorrow they take another, and the next thing you know, the Great Wall is gone. And what's next? Our children must travel abroad just to see their history. So, don'tyou see thatyou and I are the only possible defense from governments trying to strip us ofour culture? So, I hopeyou can help me do this, ifonly for the future generations ofour people. All right. I'll be honored to help. Thankyou, Fei-Hong. It's awfully quiet all ofa sudden. Where is everyone? Yeah. There's no one here. I'll go take a look. Fei-Hong:: What the::: Yaah! - Aah! - Aah! Let's go! Let's go! Move! [Shouting] Fei-Hong:: Uh-oh: What do we do? Follow me. Here I go! Get him! Huh? Man::Allright, liftit! Fu::Here, Fei-Hong! Let's go! - Aah! - Aah! Oh, they started. Oh, I see the fun's begun. Sounds great. When you have the Ax Gang, you're sure to get thejob done. That's what we're paying for. Fei-Hong, here! Hai! Unh! - Huh? - Fu::Fei-Hong! [Screaming] Oh, my God! No! Aah! Hai! Yaah! Fei-Hong! Your shirt, take it off!. OK! - Quickly, now, go! - This way! Go! Go! Move it! Run! Go on! What's this? What's going on? Don't get involved. Get on out ofhere. Now. Go on. Help. That's Fu Wen-Chi! Unh! Ow! That hurt! - Man::Hey! - [Gunshots] [Fu Yells] Fu Wen-Chi! - There! - Master Fu! Huh? Come on! Let's go! Master Fu! - Get behind! - Help! Help! - Aah! - Easy, easy! Try to stop the bleeding. Don't die! Hold on! Master Fu! We'll go for a doctor! You'll be all right! The royal seal... I know. We'll get it. Don't worry. I'll find it. The embassy. Go quickly. - What do I do? - Tonight. Hold on, Master. My fatherwill take care ofyou. I promise. Don't give up! [Gasps] No, Master Fu! Come on! [Crying] What areyou thinking? Nothing! [Low Conversation] May I giveyou a light? Hold this, please. Thanks very much. Thereyou are. Carry on. Pick it up. What's wrong with you? - Chang Tsan? - Fei-Hong? Come on! You almost killed me! What areyou doing here? Me? What areyou doing here? Come on. I got him. So, where's the seal? How should I know? Let's go. Here. Thanks. Fei-Hong:: Anybodyseeyou? Tsan::No: Ican'tsee: Yougotalight? Ofcourse: Holdit: Down. [Laughing And Clapping] Ambassador:: Looking forsomething? Is this what broughtyou here? Guard::Kneel! Ambassador:: Ihopeyoudon'tmind: We've taken the liberty to documentyour stay at our magnificent embassy. Please do enjoy our hospitality. You can go straight to hell! [Ambassador Chuckling] [Guards Shouting] Man:: That's enough!Over! A winner. That'll be all, gentlemen. We'll continue the plan as scheduled. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Thankyou. Things have worked out ratherwell now that we have thejade seal back and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam. That's right. I've already sent the embassy photographs of Fei-Hong and his friend to MasterWong. He'll sell just like I told you. He has no choice. Make sure he understands,John, that we expect him to vacate the Po Chi Lam immediately, orwe'll plan to execute Fei-Hong. Oh! Damn those boys! Don't they understand there's nothing we can do? As an embassy, they're exempt from the laws ofChina. Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go. Sit down! You know what theywant-- the rights to Po Chi Lam! Theyjust wanted to return the seal. They aren't the criminals. - You spoiled him! - You disowned him! - This is all your fault! - This is all your fault! You're impossible. And you're his father. We're running out oftime. We've got to do something. You're right. I refuse. How can I? You know this land has been in our family for centuries. There has always been a school here. What would you do, just give it up? I'll never do it. Oh, really? What would his mother have done? I bet I know! Sister, I need yourwisdom more than ever. What can we do for Fei-Hong? Can you help us? Release them. You may let them go. You OK? Just go on. Tsan. I'm grateful. Areyou hurt? OK. Stepmom. Just look atyou. I'm gonna be all right. Madam Wong. Areyou OK, Master? Some bruises, but I'll be fine. So, what will we do now? What doyou mean? MasterWong has sold the school to the embassy. He did what?! How could that be? Don'tyou see? They made him sell it. He had to or they would kill you both. You'rejust lucky to be alive. Fei-Hong, this fight is over. We can't do this anymore. I hopeyou knowyour father has sacrificed everything. I wish that they had killed me. Now, Fei-Hong, that is enough. Life's changes are like a moving river. What's here today is gone tomorrow and tomorrow brings a whole newjourney. Let's move forward and live. So, when will the ship be leaving? This Tuesday. Hmm. And everything's ready? Man:: Yes, sir: Readyandwaiting, sir: Good, good. I want to close down the factory, lay offthe workers, and transport the shipment to Hong Kong. Pick it up. Men: Yes, sir. First we work overtime! We refuse, then they beat us! Chin::Andnowthey think they can Fireallofus just like that! So, areyou guys going to let him get awaywith that? What doyou say, huh? Chang Tsan, what's going on? They closed the mill, and you know what? It was English ambassador who was in charge ofdoing it. Sounds like trouble. I don't think I can helpyou. Oh, sure. You didn't loseyourjob. Well, I'm not gonna let them push us around. Yeah. As soon as they finished the last shipment, they fired all the men. And you think they have something to do with it? I don't know, but I'm going to find out for sure. Let me think what it could be. We should check the office. Fei-Hong, could that be it? Well, we know they're up to something. - Find a way into the factory. - OK. Then we'll find a way to stop them. Let's go. [Grunting] Chin:: What--What's this? My God! Lookwhat they're doing! Well, we've got to stop them. I'll tell Fei-Hong. Hurry, Ho Sang! In a hurry? Sorry. Aah! Let go! Aah! Unh! Chin:: Gogethelp! Ho Sang, this way! No. I've got to tell Fei-Hong. Get out ofhere! Get them! Bring Fei-Hong! Go now! Yaah! Yaah! Shit! Madam, they're coming out. All right, keep it down. Then we can organize. A good idea. Good day. Good-bye. Have a safe trip. Take care ofthe baby. I will. Fei-Hong? Yes, Father? Don't get up. Keep working. Areyou almost through with that? Almost finished. Then start another one. I'll make sure he does. It's my responsibility. He's not allowed to leave. You understand me? Perfectly. All right. Good. You know, dear, I'vebeen thinkingabout names forthebaby: Ifwe were to have a boy, he could be Wong Tei-Pau. Ifit's a girl, Wong Pei. Nice. Both names are fine. But do we really need to pick one now? What ifI'm early? That shouldn't be a problem ifyou take it easy till I get back. Ofcourse. - Yes? - Fei-Hong? Water the plants. I will! Hold on! I've got to go. Remember, get lots ofrest. We'll be fine. Don't worry. Fei-Hong and I will bejust fine. Go! We don't have any time to spare! Hurry! We've got to get Chin out ofthere. I hope he's still alive. What can we do? I'm going to stop them. I'm going to do what I can! I gave my promise to Fu and Chin! What doyou think? Let's go. Hey, wait, where areyou going? I'm going to battle! But-- Wait, madam, you can't go in your condition. What condition? Come on, I'm only pregnant. Oh, madam, please. Think about the baby. What ifsomething were to happen? You're right. Go ahead without me, then. I'll go get my students. Meet me at the mill. Right. I'll gather up the men. Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong. You're with us, right? Yeah, OK. Will you be all right, madam? - Good. - I'll be fine. But what if Father finds out? Oh, go on. Who cares now whatyour father thinks? Only make me proud. I will. OK. - Yeah? - Oh! Fei-Hong! Something for good luck. I can use it. Men: We demandjustice! We demandjustice! We demandjustice! We demandjustice! [Shouting] Guards: Get back! Get back! You step aside now! We demandjustice! We know whatyou have in there! Back off!. Those antiques are notyours, and we won't let them out ofChina! You have no right to them. Is that right? Charge! Fei-Hong:: No!Noguns! Man::Kill them all! Fei-Hong, you've got to rescuejade now. - Stand back! - Get back! [Rattling] Unh! Come on! - Yaah! - Wait! Come on! One hand! Here's water! Thanks. [Gasping] - No! - Yaah! Wait! You gotta findjade. Let's go! Yeah. Let's go. Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! What happened? That drunken guy is here! We got to do something! All right, get him! [Laughs] John:: Won't thisbe fun: Wait! Doyou realize whatyou're doing? You're helping them steal our history, our culture. You mean these? They're ofno use to anyone. Iftheywant to buy them, I'll gladly sell. I won't letyou do it. And what areyou gonna do about it? Listen here, nothing's gonna stand in myway, so why don'tyoujust go home to Daddy? I've heard enough. Oh? Well, that makes two ofus. Henry? Don't waste time. Just get it overwith. Do it. You hear me? Unh! Sorry. Ha ha ha! Do something. [John Laughs] Catch! Ha ha ha! John:: Whatareyougonna donow? Hahaha! [Screaming] Help him! John::Hey! Drunken boxing, huh? Well, what doyou say? Come on! Ooh! You OK? Aah! Yaah! [Groaning] [John Laughing] Now it's over! [Moans] Give me another rod! What's this? ''A boat can foat in water, but also sink in it''? Ahh, a bit of Daddy's wisdom. Here, finish him off!. All right, this is it! Aah! [Screaming] Gah! [Gagging] Yaah! [Laughs Drunkenly] [Gagging] [Coughs] [Hic] Just perfect! How about it? Raah! Hee hee hee! Yaah! Hmm. [Applause] On behalfofthe governor, I want to thank Fei-Hong for his role in returning the stolen antiquities and on the arrest ofthe ambassador. Thankyou, sir. None ofthis could have happened without the support ofhis loving father. Ah, well, we need more fathers who treat their sons like that. You should be very proud ofhim. So, where is he? Fei-Hong is still feeling some ofthe aftereffects ofall that he's been through. We hope he'll soon be on his feet. I'm sure that he will come seeyou as soon as he can. Oh, and he better. I've got ajob for that boy. I am certain he will be most pleased.
