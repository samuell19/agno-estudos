Seventy thousand dollars for this car and they put in a piece of shit for a CD player! Son of a bitch! Great, God damn it! Merry fuckin' Christmas! I come in peace. Right, Sergeant Hawkins, evidence room J-38. 38... terrific. Thanks. How you doin'? Sergeant Hawkins, please report to room J-38. Sergeant Hawkins, room J-38. Yeah? Hello. What seems to be the problem here, officer? - Hi. - Hi. Sign there. Must be some party. Pardon me, officer? Just a joke. Thank you. You're welcome. Better hurry. What do you mean, man? That was clockwork. Better hurry. Jesus Christ! What the fuck was that? A little insurance. What the hell for? No witnesses. And when I told him the organization was simply not cost effective, he didn't listen. So, I felt the only way to exploit my talents was to branch out on my own. - Mister... - Davis. Davis, Davis, Davis, that's right-- Jeff Davis. My point is this... Much like yourself I'm sure, at an early age, I envisioned that my education would be the saving grace. Give me that, um, necessary, uh, here-- Let me give you just one example. I sensed the problem the minute I realized that MBAs were rapidly becoming a devalued commodity. I got right back into Princeton and picked up a second masters in international banking, which I suppose is the field I've ended up-- Hey, what's with all the extra muscle? Evening, Mr. Manning. Just think of them as couriers. Yeah, right, let's see what you got. Come on, guys. Education. - It's really so important. - Come on. - Can I just call you Jeff? - Yeah, well, whatever. - Come on, come on. - Without a college degree, and I'm talking about a masters, at least, a guy could become desperate. Might have to join the army. Turn to a life of crime. Or become a cop. Why don't we just cut the crap, man, and get down to business? What university did you attend? The university of suck my dick. Party time. I love this shit. Perfect. Hi. Money, money, money! Okay! Now is this deal going down or what? Whatever you say. Fuck. Shut up, shut up! Lights out, fatso! The switch is in the back! Fuck that! Shit. Keep talking, guys. God damn it! There's money! Shut up, shut up! Actually, you're Turner, right? Detective Ray Turner? You got the money, man? You done? Buzz... You're not Buzz. And you're not very smart. You cops think you're so smart. You ought to know better than to mess with me and my White Boys. Drop it. We've been on to your pathetic charade for a week. I said drop it! What the fuck is he talking about, huh? Smile, Ray. Drop it now! Fuck you. Pack it up, gentlemen. Yes, sir. Who set this up anyway? I don't know, sir. If it was Warren, he should know better. At least now there's one less cop in the world. You boys be sure to pick up every grain of that heroin. Out the back. Yes, sir, Mr. Manning. Let's go! Come on. I come in peace. What the fuck? Merry Christmas. Keep an eye on him. You bet. Son of a bitch! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Come on, man! Come on! Come on! Shit. I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna fuckin' tear his face off! We got confirmation on the federal warehouse explosion. Nine dead and at least half a dozen others injured. Lovely. Would you give us some information. - Hi, Diane. - Hi. - What's going on? - Slaughterhouse. Looks like the White Boys went through a Cuisinart. Jesus, what the hell happened? Five dead. Nobody saw or heard anything. That's nothin' new for this part of town. Caine was the first one on the scene at 11:32, but he didn't see anything either. Jack, I'm sorry about Turner. I really am. I'm so pissed off, I could throw you through a God damn window! I'm not going to do that right now. This is not the time. This is not the time to break your fucking neck either! I know how you must feel about Ray. What about Victor Manning? - Well, what about him? - He killed my God damn partner! Don't push me, Jack! You disappeared for eight days. Not even a week, which maybe I could understand. But eight fuckin' days? On top of all that, you gotta answer for the stolen heroin. Plus the 500 grand! Captain Malone, there's somebody here to see you. Oh, great-- feds. Their warehouse blows and they figure they got jurisdiction over the whole fucking town! Tell 'em-- just tell 'em I'll be right there, okay? Yes, sir. All right, you're off it. You got eight weeks vacation coming-- take it. All of it. Is that an order? No... worse. Promise me. Caine, you're the only man I know who'd rather die than break his word. So, promise me, and that's an order. I want Manning. Take the vacation or I'll make it permanent. Fine. Good. Oh, and, uh, if I were you, I'd take a little time and patch up my personal life too. Detective Caine, this is Agent Switzer of the FBI. He'd like to ask you a few questions. In private. Do you know what I do, Detective? I know things. That's all, it's my whole job. I know things before anyone else. So? I know you were after Victor Manning. I also know that these are no ordinary murders. Three well armed men had their throats cut before they could even draw their weapons. Now, who could possibly move that fast? Not who, what. I've seen a lot of knife wounds, but Manning's boys were killed by something else. Something different. - Do you think the weapon's a key? - Yes, I do. You wouldn't happen to know where I could locate your Mr. Manning, would you? I'd like a word with him. Look, I'd like to help, but I was just put on vacation. Or, uh, didn't you know that? Put Caine back on the case. Like hell I will. I'd have to make one phone call, just one. You don't want that. Well, Caine can't, he's going on vacation. Isn't that right, Caine? Well, I said I'd go, I didn't say when. Fine, you heard him, you're on it. Good. I'll send his partner over from the Bureau tomorrow. Partner? - Partner? - Caine, meet Special Agent Smith. You're kiddin', right? Cool it, Caine. I can handle this, Captain. Excuse me, Mr. Caine. I'm the youngest man ever to reach my rank at the Bureau. And I make twice as much as you do and it's for a good reason. So, don't even start that shit with me. You are kidding. You may not be accustomed to working on a case under federal jurisdiction, so Commander Switzer has asked me to lay out some parameters for your cooperation. - Parameters? - Yes. Parameters are sort of general guidelines-- I know what the word means. Well, good. We will report to Inspector Switzer daily. That means every day. There will be no strange disappearances-- - Not for a week. - Eight days. Not for a minute. Are we in agreement here? - Do you think you can tell me-- - I know that I can come in here-- I want you to talk to this man right now. Captain, the coroner's here. Thanks, Dee, send her in. You better talk to this guy. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, Diane, what did ballistics have to say about the murder weapon? Whatever it was, it was razor thin and razor sharp. It made a deep, straight incision I'd have trouble making with a scalpel. Well, how do you explain that? I can't. Diane, can, can I-- Look, I feel bad about Ray, as bad as you do. But eight days, Jack, and not even a phone call. Would you stop and listen for a second? I don't want to hear it! Hey, I like abuse as much as the next girl. But this time, when you had me wondering whether you were dead or alive, I was kind of rooting for dead. You know what I mean? Diane... hey! Pretty healthy relationship you've got there. That's one. Okay, number one on my list-- We're going to the crime scene, you drive. I think we should read the coroner's report first. Let me tell you something-- Exploit experts. Their expertise is essential. That's a quote-- page 35 from the Switzer manual. He happens to be a very brilliant man and you could learn a lot from him. Oh, yeah, can we go now or does Switzer have some other tips for me? Well, yeah, now that you mention it. Uh, you sure you want to go with that particular look? I think you should give it some thought because external things are very important. They tell people who you are. You know what I mean? In that case, maybe you should ride in the trunk. Christmas-- big deal. Holy shit! What the hell are you doin'? What does it look like I'm doing? - I'm observing, I'm taking notes. - Really? You know, the problem with most police work is you become emotionally involved, you can't think rationally. This way I can stay objective, achieve a little distance. You want distance, why don't you stand over there... by the body? God. So, it's all, um, clinical, huh? What about instinct? No such thing. Instinct is just a set of learned responses-- that's it. I've studied what to do in almost any situation. Something happens, I'm ready. I'm ready for anything. Go downstairs. Is there a point to all this or what? Downstairs. Jesus Christ. So, Agent Smith, what happens when you, uh, run into something completely new? I really wouldn't know, it hasn't happened yet. You stuck now? Yeah, maybe. - How about you? - Yep. So, what do you do? I follow my instincts. Oh, God damn, worthless, leg-humpin' piece a shit dog! Dexter! Dexter! Time to eat! Dexter? Who's out there? Miserable, low-life, pinko, scum, shit bastard! Oh, now I'm supposed to be scared? Fuckin' greedy, asshole, burglar, shithead! - Uh! - I come in peace. What the hell are we doing in a bar? I don't drink on duty. It's hardly procedure. So, proceed home. I can think here. What are you talking about? How can you think here? All the blood's leaving my head. You ain't serious. My old pal, Boner. Shit! What do you know? Come on. - Kiss that C good-bye, Slick. - Shit. I think something's wrong with your ball, Boner. Hey, hey, hey! Where's Victor Manning? Who gives a shit? Oh, fuck! My partner, he's dead. Hey, hey, no touchy. I want you and your boyfriend to tell me who killed him. You drop that please? Okay now, Boner, who killed my partner? Who's got the drugs? The fuckin' Martians. - That's who's got it. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, because it sure ain't on the street. You know, the White Boys thinks you cops did it, Caine. Ahh! I swear it's the truth. The truth. If I knew something, Caine, I'd tell ya. All right, beat it, Boner. You too. So, that's why we came here, huh? Pump Boner. Nice technique, it's very legal. And, uh, you got so much out of him. You know? I told you before, Smith... I came here to think. So, what if the weapon wasn't a blade, but a projectile? Like a cue ball. - Cue ball, huh? - Watch, watch. It cuts this guy. - Yeah. - Then it cuts this guy over here. - Yeah. - Ricochets off him, hits the wall over here, then hits here. Then cuts this guy. Ends up somewhere over here. So, we're still looking for your cue ball, is that it? That's the murder weapon, huh? Shit. Shit. - Don't touch it again. - Relax, I know what I'm doing. Get down! Now, that's a murder weapon. Hey, look up there. Procedures, procedures. You're still going on report for your mistreatment of Boner. Terrific, pull over here on the right. - All right, see you tomorrow. - See ya. Hey, hey, where do you think you're going? Inside. Hey... The Switzer Manual, page 11-- Evidence must be presented within a timely framework. Yeah, that's great, but I got a friend at the university I want to show it to first. Oh, at the university, what is he, is he a scientist? No, he's a cheerleader. He's not authorized personnel, I'm not going to allow it, God damn it, and I-- Whoa. Nice place. I'll bet that-- that's a very nice, safe place for that. Uh huh, do you want some wine? What? Wine. Maybe. Interesting painting. You like it? Yeah, well you know, it's really, uh-- - Big. - Right. I guess I didn't exactly figure you right, huh? I guess not, Smith. I want that disc. Let's be honest-- This is just a case to you. To me it's more, much more. And if you try to take this disc, I'm gonna hit you very, very hard. - Here. - Thank you so much. Let me ask you something-- Why don't you like me? And I honestly don't give a shit, but I'm curious. Is it because I'm more successful, huh, is that it? Exactly. I thought so. Not bad. I'll pick you up at 7:00. I, um, I wanted to apologize. Diane. You're done? Yeah. Jack... promise me something. What? Promise to remember my birthday. Or promise to come and visit my mother with me. I don't care what it is, just promise me something like you do everybody else. Can you do that? I don't know who pisses me off more-- you for doing this or me for letting you. - Hi. - Hi. Either you're Santa Claus or your dead, pal! It's me, it's me, God damn it, don't shoot! What the hell are you doing here? I came to pick you up and the God damn door was open, so I came in! I think you've been robbed. You FBI guys don't miss a thing, do you? No, we don't. There were more murders last night, now where's the disc? I left it with a friend last night. - A friend, huh? - Yeah. Thank God. You just got here, huh? Yes, of course I just got here, huh. Why, what-- What are you trying to say? Nothin'. No! Oh, my God! Take some coffee, guys. I'll be right with you. Thanks. I gotta relax. Extra caffeine. Lousy American coffee couldn't keep a hamster up at night. Who's the suit? Oh, Smith, here, he's a real live FBI agent. Caine, are you nuts? Relax, Dr. Bruce, I'm not here for that. Every thing I have in here is essential to my research. I believe it, I believe it. Sure, sure, you feds are all alike. You're just like that tribe in Africa. The one that always says the opposite of what they really mean. "Welcome to our village," they say. And then they kill ya. Hey, you've got nothing to worry about. See! See! Relax, calm down Bruce. Tell us about the disc. Okay. Jesus Christ, be careful will ya? Relax, G-man. In a field completely void of charge like the one I've created, it simply hovers. In simplest terms, it's a magnet. The most powerful self-contained electromagnet I have ever seen. And like any magnet, it can be attracted to other magnets of reverse polarity. That's why it stuck to the speaker magnet. It can be programmed to use other magnetic forces as a means of propulsion. You can use any frequency you want. So, how's it used as a weapon? The human body carries a small electrical charge, right? You tune the disc to the charge and then-- Flat head's basically correct. It's like turning your radio dial to K-I-L-L. The technology is incredible. I need more time to study it. Fine, keep it, we'll be back. Forget it, you've had your chance. I'm taking that thing to Switzer right now. Are you crazy, the God damn thing almost took my head off twice and I'm know what I'm doing! You can't take it. Oh really, I can't take it? You wouldn't get ten feet. Let him finish, and then you can take it to Switzer. Eh, yeah, fine... fine. Hide it. You got it. Three more like him came in last night. What makes you think they're related to our case? Cause of death-- massive heroin overdose. And this guy was no addict. Look-- It's definitely not self-induced. Was it the fed's heroin? I think so. The potency was incredible. Your psycho stole a lot of heroin to kill people with. Why? I mean... why would he do that? People do a lot of sick things to each other. What about the bullet hole? Oh, it's not a bullet hole. What is it? I'm about to find out. Do you want to stick around. No, no, thanks, I'll pass. I'm just going to make a... a phone call or something. Sorry. Dr. Schaeffer, pathology. Dr. Schaeffer, pathology. - Come on. - I'll call you back, sir. It got kind of stuffy in there, you know? Caine... here. This came for you about an hour ago. Thanks. What's with you two, anyway? Kind of a love-hate thing? Or a hate-hate thing. What's that? Dear Caine, having a great time in Rio. Wish you were dead. Love, Victor Manning. P.S. I told Warren to look you up. Who's Warren. Will you look at that bastard smiling? He kills my partner then goes to Rio for Christmas. - So, who's Warren? - Manning's partner. Head of the White Boys-- yuppie criminals. I've been after this guy for two years now. Where are we going, anyway? Going to see Warren before he sees us. Okay. What'd you say? I said okay. Oh, shit. How well do you know this neighborhood? A little. Let me drive. No, unh-uh, no way, it's my car, I'm driving. Really? Well, there are two members of the White Boys following us. Come on, let me take the wheel. I said I'm driving. On second thought, you go ahead. Turn right. God damn it! Come on, what are you doing? The short cut, did you ever hear of those? Let's stop fuckin' around and get some back up in here! I know what I'm doin'. Shit, where'd you get that? Christmas present from my mother. Look out! Caine, come on, we're not gonna play chicken, are we? - Last thing a White Boy wants... - Caine, Caine! is a scratch in his car. I got him. Son of a bitch! That's it, Warren's a dead man. Where are we? Is this Warren's? Yep. We have to follow procedure, Caine. Don't you realize that? We have to go back and get a warrant. - Now. - Nope. Now I don't care. Damn it! Hey. Shit! Next. Al, what's the latest on the LBO in transit? Hey, hey, hey! - Not here-- the carpet. - Sorry. Guns on the table. Come on, boys. Do it. All right, now get up. I said get up! Okay, Warren, now you and I are gonna have a talk. Nice to see you again, Caine. Just sit down, Warren. You shouldn't have come here. Victor didn't want to go to Rio 'til next month. Place is packed. He had to fly coach. I didn't kill your boys, Warren. Bullshit! You're after the wrong guy. For some reason, you cops have called a drug war. What, did we forget a payment or something? Our sales in the last three days have gone straight into the crapper. I mean, we could be talkin' no bonuses this quarter. Drug war? What the fuck are you talkin' about, drug war? Why, why, why am I even talkin' to this guy? 'Cause you're gonna kill him. Oh, right. Nothin' personal, Caine. Just business. You're forgetting who's got the gun. Oh, I think I can come up with some leverage. All right, Caine, you've got two things to consider. Come on, man, move it. One, Victor wanted you dead by the close of business today. Two... we have a drop to make. I ought to call it off, but we have a serious cash flow problem. So, you're going to do it for me. If anybody's gonna be killed, I guess it's just gonna have to be you. Forget it. Oh, you'll do it. Or else you'll start to get a very bad reputation for losing partners. You understand the drill, right? Just give it to me. No mistakes, pal. Hope you guys understand you're in a lot of trouble. Yes, sir, what can I do for you? Don't be foolish. Tell the White Boys to kiss my ass. Come on. What the fuck was that? What happened God damn it, what happened? Who was that? What's going on, God damn it? Just shut up and let me think. Who's this? You're gonna tell me what happened out there and right now. Just wait here, we'll go back for the disc later. Oh, fine, fine, you go right ahead and take your time, you know? And don't worry about me. I'm just here at your God damn beck and call, okay? I think so. Yes. Maybe, mm-hm. Excuse me, young lady, emergency call, FBI. You're not going to believe what just happened. Thank you. Do you have change for a dollar? I always thought I'd be the one to wring your neck. Cute. You wanna answer my question? Yeah, roughly speaking. Heroin stimulates the pituitary to make endorphins. Endorphins are a hormone that create an incredible sense of well being. Nature's ecstasy. So, if you shot somebody up, drilled a hole in-- Theoretically, you'd have your hands on a nearly perfect drug. One ounce would be enough for a thousand doses. Why theoretically? Well, there's no way in the world to do it. Nobody has anything like the technology to preserve or administer the stuff. Not yet, anyway. Let me run it down for you again, operator. I want to place a collect call, okay? No, no, a collect call. Hey. William Springer, report to your office. You're gonna think I'm crazy, but-- Oh, no, no, don't let that stop you. It hasn't-- it hasn't yet, you know. John Weber, telephone. I think we're dealing with aliens and not from Mexico. There are two of them. One's the killer and I think the other one's on our side. Let me tell you something. You work very hard. Your mind and body require rest or they break down. It's only natural. I need you to listen to me. You need a psychiatrist, Jack. Look, somebody had to be the first. First what, huh? First person to see aliens, huh? You don't have any proof. No one's gonna believe it. I got the disc. Come on. Bruce? Jesus. What happened? What do you think happened? Bastards stole the disc. Your pal. I knew something like this was going to happen. God damn it! I tried to lie. I swear it. They knew I had it. Are you all right? Feel like I look. You look like shit. Look who's talkin'. Do you know who they were? I don't know. Troglodytes with bad haircuts. Looked like you, actually. Why don't you shut up. Terrific, it's our one piece of evidence and it's gone. What are you lookin' at? We're going to Malone. Oh. It's you're career, you go ahead. What are you going to do, tell him we're fighting drug dealers from outer space, huh? No shit, man, he had to be at least seven feet tall. I saw him about two blocks down the street. Yeah, sure you did. Last week you saw Jimi Hendrix at the Laundromat, remember? Right, with a drier full of tie-dyed shirts. Man, no shit, there's a crazy motherfucker runnin' around the place. Don't you all ever read the news? - Aw, shit. - Hey, just stay cool. That's him, that's the guy. Hey. I come in peace. Yeah, sure you do, tall guy. What are you a politician? Hey, leave him alone! Shit, what the fuck are you doin', man? You're gonna back me up on this, right? Absolutely. - Promise. - No problem. Say what? I agree with you, sir, I agree with you 100%. I think Detective Caine is jumping to conclusions. - Now-- - You spineless son of a bitch. Do you do this to test me, Jack? - It's true! - Well then bring me some proof. What about that disc you say you found? Somebody stole it! - Yeah, sure. - Might be Switzer. Malone here. Yep. What? Where? How many? Yeah. Your boy just killed two more people at a downtown market. This time we have a witness. Dee, tell Harper, Borland, and Mulroney to meet me at this address, right now. Thanks. I've got a career to think about. I can't afford to start telling stories about God damn spacemen. If you can't help, just stay the hell out of my way! - Inspector Switzer says-- - That's two! How many do I get? Why can't you understand this is federal? Because I'm the God damn coroner, that's why. If I don't count as authorized personnel, I don't know who does! I can't help you, I'm sorry. - I don't want you to help me, I want-- - I can't help you! Jesus, why am I talkin to you? You're a Neanderthal. Hey, there's no reason to get personal. - What's going on here? - Oh, Jack, thank God. - This, this-- - Asshole? Thank you. This asshole won't let me in. There are corpses in there. Reports are being made out in my name and I can't see the bodies. Detective Caine. The crime scene has been sealed. - Who sealed it? - I'll handle this, please. What seems to be the problem? Smith, FBI. Look, you can all put your wallets away. I don't care if you got the gold card, you're not gettin' in there. - I think we are. - Well, I think not. Come on. Hey, Frank, what the hell is going on here? I don't know, they got the place completely-- I thought you were a big shot FBI guy. Come on, don't give me any shit, I've never seen those guys before. Isn't that your boss? Yeah. Just talk to that guy right there. Inspector Switzer? Oh, it's okay, let him through. What the hell's goin' on here? Where's that witness you were talking about? There is no witness. Now, listen to me, don't talk. Just listen. It's all taken care of. This case is closed. As of this moment, you are officially on vacation-- now, beat it! What does that mean, "taken care of?" It means it's not our problem anymore. Get outta here! Excuse me, Diane, come here for a second. I've been put on vacation. How 'bout taking a trip? - What? - A long one, just you and me. Someplace we never heard of. What about my job, Jack? Take a vacation too. - I can't. - Then quit, look at this. Don't tempt me, Jack, I'll do it. Good. You go home, pack, and pick me up at my place. Are you serious about this? I promise. Cross my heart. Jack, mess with me on this one, and I'll have your lungs filled with water. Hey. Hey. Hey! What's the matter, aren't we friends anymore, huh? Well, I guess that's it, huh? What did Switzer tell you? - Just about the whole story. - Bullshit. Hey, I know what I need to know, okay? All right, that's three! Do you know the difference between you and me? You don't fuckin' care. You just want to please. Fuck you, I do my job. I do what I'm asked to do and I respect my superiors! That's the difference between you and me. I'm a team player. Well, your team sucks. Oh, shit. He must be stopped. You've got some set of balls, you know that? Give us a second, will ya? I never, ever want to work with you again as long as I-- Holy shit! Calm down, he's the one I told you about. Look, look. He's on our side. Let's get the hell outta here. Holy shit. Oh, man, he's bleeding. Who are you? An officer of the law. Like you. Oh, he speaks English, huh? Stop him. What does he want? Barcy, a priceless drug. Where I'm from... rare and illegal. What you call endorphins. Dealer, just a lousy dealer. I don't believe any of this is happening. He'll kill your people by the thousands to get it cheaply. Where did you say you were from? Stop him. If he returns, others will come. It will be a slaughter. He's at the storage place. Destroyed it. Near a waterway. It could be the Fletcher building. You must promise me. Promise me. I promise. At least we have something now, you know? - What? - His body. We got proof. Shit! God damn it, I got it, I got it. - There's nothing left of him, man. - Jesus Christ! - Did you see that? - Did I see it? It almost blew my fuckin' face off, man. You all right? I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right. I got it. I got his weapon. Great, that's our proof. All we gotta do is take it to Malone and-- Wait a second, Inspector Switzer has to be informed. He has to see it first. - Forget Switzer. - You want to stop this thing? You think Malone's gonna do it, huh? You're dreaming. I'm taking this to Switzer, he'll stop it. No, he wont. Switzer is a liar. He'll tell you one thing, he means another. Pretty soon he'll feed you that old line about breaking eggs to make an omelet. Can't you see that? Now, give me the gun. No. What do you mean, no? Come on. I said no. Sorry, Jack. I'll use it. You stupid fuck, you know? You've been a pain in the ass since this thing started. Sorry you feel that way. I'm taking this to Switzer. I'm just doing my job. Are you? We're the good guys, Jack. Somewhere along the line you just forgot that. Know what I mean? - You okay? - Yeah. Good. Don't worry, you did the right thing. You did a fantastic job and your record'll reflect that. First a disc, and now this. What happens now, sir? I mean, I was wondering how this was going to be handled, you know. Larry, I'm surprised at you. Ask me so many questions. Been around Caine too much, I guess. No. Well, suffice it to say that this will be applied to the national interest. Well, that's, that's something I, I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I won't ask you to remove Caine. You've done enough work on this one. Remove him? What are you talking about? Don't be naïve. The military benefits of a successful contact with this alien are enormous. And cannot be compromised by somebody like Caine, who just wants to kill it. As far as you're concerned, this case is closed. Alien's killing people. Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. Don't worry. You get used to this kind of work. Trust me. Never trust nobody. Caine manual, page one, chapter one. Thanks for helping me out back there. Forget it. You wanna quit? No. No. I'm kinda used to following procedure. You know? Right now, I think we should just... kick some ass. Why'd you follow me, anyway? Instinct. You know how to use that gun? Yeah, sure, sure. It's just a gun. Fuck. - Hey, look. - What? Where you goin'? Look at this shit. Ow, God damn it! - We're too late. - We missed him. No, no, no, get out, I got him, I got him! Shit! Shit! Go, go, go, go! Come on! - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Give me that gun. - No, no, no, I'll get it, I'll get it. - Damn it, it's stuck! - Come on. Come on, get back, get back! Yeah, take that, you miserable son of a-- bitch. Run! I got it, I got it! Whoa! - You all right? - Did I hit him? - I think I got him. - I think so. Where's that big son of a bitch? Hell of a recoil, huh? This baby can do some damage. Aw, where is he? I don't know. What is that? What is that? Looks like we've got what he came for. It's the endorphins. Lucky son of a bitch. Ow, ow! One clear shot, man, that's all I needed. One clear shot and that big, ugly bastard would have been history. What are you doin'? I've got an idea. What idea? He wants his stuff and we don't want to fight him here. What do you mean, where? Somewhere I can give you your one clear shot. You got a jacket in there or something for me? I thought you didn't like my clothes. Thanks. We might need this. Hey, fits. It should, it was mine when I was twelve. Thank you. Bring the space gun. We're outta here. Diane. Jack, quit screwin' around. I'm already packed. - Gosh, Diane. - Diane. Yeah, Diane. Uh, what's going on? You gotta go home. Come on. I thought we were going on vacation. Well, something came up. God damn it, Jack, I just quit my job! Do you understand that? I know, I know, I can explain. Careful, Caine, don't let her get the upper hand. Jack, I wish you'd just tell me what the hell is going on-- Christ, who the hell is that? You fucked up, Caine! Oh, shit, not now. Where's the money? That's it, these guys are level two. Throw down your weapons... now! I'm still waiting for an explanation. It's getting kind of complicated, stay down. I said drop 'em! Fuck you. Come on, let's get outta here! What the fuck? Who the hell is that? - Come on, get in the car. - Go, go, go, get in. Start the car! Start the Car! Seventeen-W9 proceeding north on Grand. I need backup. I'm being pursued by a blue and white. Who is that guy? Some asshole from outer space. Yeah, but there's nothin' to worry about. I've got this. Oh, I see, a space gun. So, you guys are right on top of things. Look out! Brace! Get, get, get back on the street! Get back on the street! Just stay on the sidewalk, stay on the sidewalk! Jack! Oh, shit! Get out of the way, get out of the way! Get out of the way! Be careful! You in the police car, move your vehicle over immediately! You are driving a police vehicle without authorization. Pull it over, now! Aw, shit! He's still with us. I'm gonna toast this clown. Oh, yeah! Oh, shit! - Upstairs? - Yeah. Jack. Keep moving, Smith, up that ladder. All right, up there, Smith. Your one clear shot. I'm right behind you, hurry! There he is, there he is. Okay, let's push this all the way to four. Perfect. Come on, come on. He's going for it. No! Lights out. - Fuck! - It's empty. Smith, it's empty, come on, let's get outta here! No! Get outta here! - Jack! - Come on! Move, move, move! Go, go, go, go! Hurry! What are you doing? Come on, come on! - Jack! - Get the hell outta here! Come on, let's go! Move it! Come on, let's go. Watch yourself. Hold it. Let her go. I said let her go! I win! Fuck you, spaceman. Smith! Smith! Come here. Are you all right? Let me at him. I come in peace. And you go in pieces, asshole. Jack! Come on! Hell of a night, huh? Yeah, ow, ow! Glad I softened him up for you. Yeah, nice work, Smith. What the hell is your first name, anyway? - Arwood. - What? Arwood-- my friends call me Larry. Uh-huh, nice work, Smith. Can we please go on vacation now? I promised, didn't I? Where are we going, anyway? Well, I was thinkin' of Rio. No no, no. No. No.
