Only you understand. Only you can know. Only you will wait. Only you believe. Hours on the phone, we're in for no one, wasted encounters. When we were kids, things were true on the other side of you... Main street, Decazeville Two years earlier... Topic 1: "Certainty, not doubt, leads to insanity." Topic 2: "Living without music is to err." When everything goes black, I'm afraid to believe. Everything is so fragile. If I want you, I'm afraid to say it. I imagine... Who's first? I'm afraid to say it. I imagine... an island. We'll roll the dice, okay? Who's feeling lucky today? Not you, Steph, you know why. Hello, go back to sleep. How about this side? Little Miss Jeanne... Hello... If it's odd, it's music. If it's even, it's doubt. Doubles, you choose between them. Double 6, you choose whatever you want. Okay, Jeanne? Relax, your life's not at stake, even if it is. Your friend Johanna rolled them right away. Double six! Kiss him! Doubt. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, Jeanne! Forget about it! Johanna, taking your legs for a walk? Same old Chatterbox! You're late again. Go wash Mrs Campergue's hair. She'll be on time the day pigs have wings. Sit there. I saw your picture in the paper. You look great! In the Hicksville Times? One day she'll be famous. Eddy Barclay will discover her. Mom, Eddy Barclay is 102! So? He's still very charming. And he's the marrying type. As I was saying, you can't have kids alone. Jeanne's father left for a reason. Always a reason. Catherine was hot to trot. Only a retarded sex prude would say that. What? Her mom's the warmest person I know. That's nice for me. Whores are often warm. What's your problem? You can't do anything right! Sit back down. I don't know what got into her. - It's ice cold. - I'm sorry. I walk along the sandy shore. The boats sail by, the seagulls soar. The azure sky I have my eyes on, Shows no father on my horizon. The things I missed and misunderstood. The things that make a childhood. Time goes by, I've turned the page. I don't even know his age. The hurt does remain, the wound, my lasting pain, My soul was bruised and then marooned. I knew you'd be here. Are you okay? How can you like spending time here? I work. I watch the witch and the prince's horse. The witch and the prince's horse? Are you crazy? Come on, I'll show you. Look. There's the witch's nose and head. And there's the prince's horse. All I see is water and trees. If ever I meet a man who sees what I see, he'll be the love of my life. What were you singing before? A song for my father. Forget about him! All he left you is this! You'd never recognize him! It helps me... I need to. I want you to write me a letter. A break-up letter, to break up. Again? What's the reason? I love someone else. That's a good reason! Will you write it for me, Jeanne? Come on... So... "Dear Michel, I love someone else." Isn't that too abrupt? "I prefer to say it abruptly and not beat around the bush. "I'm not good at being a hypocrite." Excellent. "What can I say? "Must I try to explain? "With love, there's no explaining "how it comes "or how it goes. "My love for you is simply "less strong than "my love for..." - Who? - Jean-Louis. You don't know him. "...for Jean-Louis. - "You don't know him." - It's his best friend. Impossible. Because of all that absence I lack a certain nonchalance I don't have much confidence In the men I love. Hello, Mr Montgolfier. My mom's not here? She's working on the window display. She's back there. - How are you? - Fine, and you? How are you doing? They're all new styles? It's hard to find the right one. To each his own. You kids prefer shoes like these. The rustic look. They scare these. Then there are walking shoes. For exploring life and the world. They don't belong next to these. After action... comes reflection. We see life through rose-colored glasses. That's what's nicest. But you get stepped on. By people who just walk away. Some feet are delicate. What you do for love, you never regret. I'd like to see the beige leather pants in size 36. You'll look great! They're for my best friend. It's her birthday. I don't have them in beige. I have it in red. Red? No, she's too discreet. She wouldn't. Is she plain? Jeanne, plain? She's gorgeous! She doesn't play it up. So she's alone. You guys are too dumb. For you, pretty girls need signs saying "Pretty". And pants are signs? For superficial idiots like my mother. Goodnight. Don't stay up late. - Don't worry. - Goodnight, Mom. Every year she gives me shoes for my birthday. Every year, they're not my style. So every year I wear them once and put them away. Now I find them pretty. Will you do the same with my pants? Close your eyes. Close them! Don't cheat! Keep them closed! So? Am I a dog? You're so pretty, it's disgusting. Are you teasing me? I'd give anything to be you. Lucky for you, you can't. Like the shoes, you'll never wear them. Yes, I will. Promise me you'll wear them some day. Go on, promise me now. I promise. Paulette! It's the phone. Are you Paulette? I'm Jeanne. I'm watching you tonight. You know me. Oh yes. Excuse me, Jeanne. It's me, Johanna! Who is it? Just a sec. My friend, Johanna. May I? Please... Jeanne. Okay. What the hell? Finally! No, I just felt like calling. Nothing special. It's over with Jean-Louis. He made up with Michel. I'd have done the same. How about you? I'd have done the same. Me too, like Mrs Laubier. Like Mrs Laubier? No, the same as you. I found another guy. He's from Paris. Lots of fish in the sea. Fish in the sea? That's funny. I don't know. Hold on. What's your name? Luc. It's Luc. Francis is cute. Do you really love him? Goodnight... Do you mind when I talk sex? No, but with him it's not like that. It'll end up like that. Look at me. It always starts that way. And ends that way too. But one day, it'll start that way and end in love. Dream on... You really think I'm dumb! You can love a guy and not have sex. But if you love him and don't want sex, then he's just a friend. Is your teacher just a friend? You see? See what? Above all, I need to love - and to believe. - I believe what I see. What do you see? People together to avoid being alone. People having babies, building houses... to avoid being alone. 50 year-old guys who dump their wives, kids and homes for a girl like me. Just for sex. I see these people walking up and down the street in Decazeville. And I don't want that. None of it. Hi, Catherine. How are you? Hi, Mrs Laubier. You prefer to let them dance around on borrowed money. I prefer nothing. I'm following orders. There are legal procedures to respect. Paris sent us here to close the mine in three months. That's what we're paid for. Don't forget it. Luc? What are you doing here? Hello. This is my cousin, Johanna. - Hi there. - Philippe, my boss. It's good to see you. What are you doing in this hick town? That majorette is over the hill. Go tell her. It's my mom. I live here. I was even born here, cousin. I'm really sorry. What do they teach you at business school? That man there is my dad. Jesus! Over the hill too? It's 30 years in the mines. The union leader? You know him? Why are you here? Can you keep a secret? We're closing the mine. That's why we were sent here. Again she was in my dreams. She didn't go out of her way to be. Off with her clothes! She's less pretty than she seems. It's better. She's made just for me... Off with her clothes! My dreams were so strong that the sheets are still singing... Listen... Listen, dammit! Aren't you sick of fighting? You never stop. I have something important to say. The mine is closing. I said the mine is closing. The mine is closing. I love that cousin of yours. You're fired. Don't worry. We've planned it out. We'll set up retraining courses. We won't give in! Please! Don't ruin everything! We're here to have fun! And now, the sun's back out, so let's enjoy ourselves. It's time for live karaoke with our guests, "The Sirens"! - Who'll go first? - Me. What's your name? Pierre Montgolfier. I've had a shoe store in Decazeville for 40 years. I don't want to have to close. Not for myself, I'm old anyway. But for the kids... Sure, we understand. What will you sing, Mr Montgolfier? Mr Montgolfier will try to sing "Sweet France" by Charles Trenet. Sometimes I can unlock familiar memories. I can see the black smock of my old school days. On the way to class I'd sing aloud, love songs without words, songs of yesterday... Sweet France, my childhood was like a trance, a time of such insouciance, ‚ÄùWe kept you in my heart. My village, with its steeple and simple homes, where the children of my age shared all my joys. Yes, I love you. And this poem is for you. Yes, I love you, in all my joy and pain. In Decazeville... At the Miners Ball. You don't believe me? I don't care, Olivia. I just got fired. It's not your money. It's your parents'. I do my best. This isn't what I dreamt of! When everything goes black, when I'm scared to believe, when everything is fragile... if I close my eyes, I no longer know if I should ask you again to take my hand. If the hours go by when it gets too late if only I know... Tell me... Will you be there? I had other dreams. I thought you did too. I guess I was wrong. Yeah, yeah... Whatever you say. Shit! What were your dreams? Come in from the rain. Why are you snubbing us out here? How was our song, Eddy? Not bad... but we're a group, Johanna, and people come to see "The Sirens". No one gives a damn about "The Sirens"! You have to make it alone or you'll be robbed and at their mercy. Since when are you an impresario? Since a minute ago. It's my new job. Mom wants me at work on Tuesday. No problem. Is this just a weekend tryst? I told my mom I'm quitting school for this? For you two lovebirds? Luc, take me home. Johanna, you'll be able to walk up and down Main Street. We'll sing naked with "The Sirens". Is that your dream? Luc, you can look for work. Factories keep closing. Plenty more work for your type! I'm scared. Luc may not be Eddy Barclay or Prince, but he believes in us. - We're nothing. - That's not true! We're nothing if we don't try. I'm scared too. But I'm scared of not trying. I want to have a choice. The white line in front of me... Take me to where life keeps its promises... Just in time, and always in rhyme I have the price of the rice for Jeanne. I've been her fan... Since time began. Since time began. Not bad... J.P.! Vanilla-flavored condoms? 5 francs! She's out to get me! And the toilet paper? - Extra soft. - 9 francs! No, the 18-pack! Hurry! Chill! I don't got rockets in my pockets! "Your fan since time began." A bit much... Then again... Hurry, J.P.! Out to get me bad! To her register I ran, 'Cause I've been her fan since time began. Not bad... Jesus! Gotta love it! Amazing! Too cool... Crank up my guitar. I can't hear it. It's lousy. What's lousy, bud? Everything's lousy, bud. - I'll be checking out. - You have another session? No, my brother-in-law needs help carrying wood. Maurice? It's a love song. It's a ballad. Our voices have to soar with the music, like on the wings of angels. Heavy love can't fly. Okay, I get it. I'll do it like I'm flying high. Pain in the ass. Try doing it lighter, airier. Like angels' wings. Yeah, I get it. Why didn't you say so? Jasper, pump in the juice. Want to make some money? You bet! Sell your guitar. Thanks, Paolo. I'll find another job. Anything. We'll pay you back. Rule 1: "Never give in. Failure teaches success." Rule 2: "Attack the problem head-on." Jasper, sit down. I spent everything I had on those two recordings. I hate the results, but I know they're talented. Choose your style. Better musicians cost a lot more. You have to start over. I'm broke. I'll work for free. We'll be partners. I'll bring the studio down, but musicians cost money. We have none. Yeah, we have none. 3 coffees for table 5. Pick up! Your coffee. Mr Jasper, you have a phone call... Do I disgust you? You prefer that bitch? You avoid me. You never say a word. It's like I'm invisible. I may not want you sexually, but I like you. It's that I'm in love. That's news. With who? Paolo. - The men's room? - Rule 3: "It's my life." Rule 4: "Never mix work and sex." I broke it already. That's in your books, not real life. Thanks for the cassette. I'm touched. We were lousy last night. I'm beat. - It's for your ears only. - Chill out. J.P.! The 10-pound bag of kitty litter? Coming, darling! I'm exhausted. What do we care? 223 francs, please. It's not working. J.P.! We're crazy. We're a dime a dozen. No money, an inexperienced producer. This is my lot in life: a cashier. With a little luck, I'll do office work upstairs. Not bad! A cashier married to a philosophy teacher. Maybe his name will be Francis. 295 francs for the cognac. You never miss a beat. That's us! That's our song! It's you? Not bad. Who is it? It's cool! What's this? A tea party? Is there a music aisle here? Who's Francis? I'm not saying! You have the DAT's? And the cassettes. Don't worry. Bye, J.P. Rule 4: "Never mix business and..." The Stars of Tomorrow Look, J.P.! 1st prize: Cut your own single Paolo was upset. I can't be long. They don't take groups. So I came for nothing. Wait, Johanna. You should do it. Alone? Are you crazy? Come on, please. We'll show them we're one and the same. If it doesn't work, go anyway. You may win. - You're our chance. - Why me and not you? Me alone on a stage? Anyway, we're one and the same. You're better on stage. It's called "optimizing our abilities". Does that crap come from Luc? Which one sings? We're stuck. Siamese twins. There are people waiting. It's her. Johanna. Your stage name? It's Jeanne and Johanna. Next year we'll take groups. By then we'll be too expensive. Helllllllllllllllo Toulouse! You'll be surprised by the unknown talents revealed tonight who will soon become... The stars of tomorrowwwwwwwwww! We'll start straight away. Here's Jo√´lle, the Rapping Belle. No, she's a pretty girl who raps. Is this the Gong Show? A big hand for Jo√´lle! They're not that good. Can't you see? You're the best. - Am I on time? - Hi, Luc. How was Paris? Like I said, a dime a dozen. Too many would-be singers. But not enough audiences. Except for live TV. So tell us. You arrive with your wonderful cassette, you give it to them, and they calmly tell you they'll get back to you. Then they throw it in a bin with hundreds of others. Johanna, 2 minutes. My friend in the booth is letting me do the mix. Don't you worry. Let me come. If we like it a lot... Stand up and clap like wild. She comes from Decazeville, in the Aveyron... And she wrote this song herself. Her name is... Johanna! You're gorgeous! I love you! When everything goes black, when I'm afraid to believe, when everything is fragile... if I want you, I'm afraid to say it. I imagine an island. Tell me... Will you be there? When everything goes black, I'm afraid to believe. Everything is so fragile. Remember her name! What presence! What a voice! I'll say! What did you do? What happened? It wasn't my voice? I was too scared to stop. You two are one and the same. Like they said, what presence, what a voice! Jerome Lesage, MCA. You're very talented. - Who's J.P.? - Me. You signed up? Did you know? Watch... A living legend is about to be born. Yeah, we got first prize. MCA... It's American. It's really, really famous. Yeah, better than Eddy Barclay. A bad hair day? Not at all. To Paris, Mom. No, just two songs. It's not bad. It's a start. I agree but on one condition. J.P. comes along. After you memorize the posters, tell us if you'll give up becoming a living legend. I need an assistant. Another career down the drain. Can I have some more voice? And more playback too. Okay. - Some more trombones too. - There are none. - No trombones? - No, no trombones. Imagine a brass band without trombones. I have to cut your hair. A hairdresser's daughter. I'm the shame of Decazeville. I went to Carita. That's Carita? I paid. Things would be classier with Mr Barclay. So who exactly sings? Is it you or Jeanne? It's Jeanne, Mom. Why? Don't let her! You give her your body, your personality. It's the opposite. I get her voice and intelligence. That Jeanne can make you believe anything! Stop it, now. Johanna, open up! You're on in five minutes! She says she looks like a publicist. What the hell? Her first TV show! It took six months to get it! Johanna, it's Jeanne. Open up. Let me in. She's from Aveyron. Yes, you heard me! She's the new sensation in French pop music. One of the rare romantic singers in this cruel world. Ladies and gentlemen... Johanna! Where is she? Fill the air. She's coming. She was just in her dressing room. I have to tell you, this is her first time on our show. It's funny... You don't really look like a romantic. Even whores are capable of love. Says you! For me, romanticism is passion. If you can love passionately, you're romantic. I'm not the airline stewardess you were expecting. A word of advice: Save your breath because it's time to sing. Why do we always say the same old things? Why do we pack up one morning drawn by some mystery? Why do lights in the distance hypnotize me? Why do I close my eyes to black it all out? As if nothing at all mattered anymore... The White fine in front of me. Take me where fife keeps its promises. Some place I can go Without leaving a forwarding address... I wanted to die. I felt so alone, I was icy down to the bone... I thought I couldn't go on, so cold inside. Then I discovered you on TV and on the radio. I realized I wasn't alone. My body warmed up, and I felt hopeful again. I just wanted to thank you. Brigitte, Johanna is touched by your call. We all are. Did you know your songs had such impact? I sing what I feel. I don't deserve... I mean... I'm the one who should say thanks. I can't. It's Jeanne who should... Calm down. Francis, Johanna is a bit overwhelmed... I can understand. I teach philosophy and my students consider Johanna a major romantic, like Musset! I know Johanna... You taught her? I taught her friend Jeanne, but Johanna's unforgettable. Francis? Jeanne will be thrilled! And are you? Maybe you can continue this off the air... Of course. I wanted to tell Johanna that she's become "a cultural epiphenomenon". Hurry up. I want a bath. You seem upset. Not now, okay? - Drain it. - No time. - How did the radio go? - What? How did the radio go? Next week, we move. I want my own place. What do you want? A villa? A castle? Money's meant to be spent. And I want my life. You know who called the radio? Francis. He called for you. He's coming. For me? You look great! Too damn sexy! You like it, J.P.? He's decided to brood tonight. Screw you. If he asks where I am, say: "She's out with J.P., the sound guy. "She's in love. He's clueless." You use me and J.P. to talk about you and him. Isn't that cool? She freaks me out! Is he really coming for me? The dumbest teacher with the ugliest girl. It's obvious! It's sexier down! I saw that in a cheese commercial! Killer cheesy! I'm going... Stand tall and tell all. Promise? I promise. - She can be a pain. - You think? I'm sorry. I know you're sad, but I've been up front. I want tonight to work. I want it so badly. It hurts, but I prefer to be frank. Frank? The pants, the make-up! You're not Jeanne! It's not you. You're a fake. - A fake Johanna for that jerk. - He's no jerk! He's phony. You never hear from him. You're into ghosts? I prefer to keep dreaming. You don't dream love. You live it. I'll play out your trip for you. I'll play it out. Come in. Hello, Jeanne. They're for you. I hope you like them. They're beautiful. I have the perfect vase. I've never stopped thinking of you. As soon as I heard Johanna's songs, I knew you'd written them. I love your heart. I'm serious. Even if you were old and ugly, without arms or legs, a rotting elephant, I'd still love you. You're 100% emotion. I love you. Now the other version. The real one. Hi, Johanna! Oh, Jeanne... Johanna isn't here? What's up? Johanna isn't here? Happy now? Did you get what you wanted? Go away, J.P. Go away... Here... Put them in water. Come in. It's open. Joha... Oh, Jeanne. Johanna's not here? You look good. She's not in? No, she's out. Three days with that asshole! Are you being professional or jealous? Jealous. Isn't three days a record? You see this goldfish? He loves me. Jeanne, are you here? "His name is J.P. and he says he's sorry. "In the studio, I'm like a goldfish in my glass bowl." Can I tell her? - We're doing a concert in Paris! - We open for Paul Personne. When? In two months. You have one week to finish the album. More good news: Jerome loves what he's heard. Great voice. They think the single was a fluke. The album is a sure-fire hit. Now get to work. Wait, I have some great news too. David and I wrote a song. Sorry... You write? You remember his name? How do you tell them apart? He's been a great influence. He inspires me. He's my muse. So I wrote the last song of the album! - Me too. - Great. Let's listen to both. - Why? - To choose the best one. Let's not choose. I've written ten. Do the last one. You're the best so you can take pity on me? I want us to choose the best song. So there! - Who starts? - Johanna. Remember, I'm lousy at piano. It needs to be arranged. I'm an arranger. Okay, here I go. Baby, see my hands quiver. You're deep under my skin. Wrap your arms around me as I shiver. Your eyes make my head spin. I'm your body addict... I'm a... Wait, Johanna. I'll accompany you. - Okay. - It'll be better. Ready? Baby, see my hands quiver. You're deep under my skin. Wrap your arms around me as I shiver. Your eyes make my head spin. I'm your body addict. I'm a love derelict. I'm your body addict. Just a sex convict... So? - It's great. You should write more. - Really? - Sing us yours, Jeanne. - Come on... It's for J.P. Melancholy, my old friend. Looking at things, life's dead-end. It's more than a confidence. It's from you to me... My insomnia, such consolation, dressing my wounds in my desolation. It's more than a confidence, It's from me to you. If, between us, there's only one step to take, I wish you'd take it for me. We 'd take the old records from our past. We'd drive all night like in a movie. We'd talk about love and we'd make it last... Who cares where we go, if you take me there. Who cares where we go, if you take me there. Which one? Jeanne's fits in better. Sure it fits in! She wrote the whole album! How about you, Jasper? Afraid to enter the voting booth? You don't like my song? No, I don't. Jeanne's is better. I think everyone here agrees. Sign my song. You're a monster! You act like a saint to humiliate me! You're disgusting! You and your deodorized love! Get a life! Loosen up, above and below! - Johanna, wait! - Are you my mother now? - We need to talk. - Stow it, Saint Jeanne! Why do you hate me? You judge me! You never stop. You're too good. Everything you do is good. No one knows how disgusting you are. I'm the disgusting one? Are you sure? You spoil everything. You're stupid! You're empty! Listen to your song. It's tacky. You think the world is yours. You have a nice ass but no heart. How was Francis? Bitch! You knew he came for you. You knew what it meant to me. You have to turn on everyone. I did all that? Good. He didn't deserve you. He's a loser. Maybe I don't deserve you either. You should be signing these autographs. I don't care about fame. I don't care if you fuck while I write! You think I like screwing guys addicted to mirrors? At least you're screwing! What should I sing? I don't know. "Melancholy". Thank you. I love you. I've never said "I love you" to anyone before. Hello, Lyon! You want love? Lots of it? Then bet all you got on it. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. It's now! We confuse friendship and love. That's why I wrote this song. So my best friend knows no guy can come between us. Right, gals? That's enough! Johanna needs to rest! Why did you kick them out? I'm not tired. - About your show... - It went well! They want a singer, not a speaker. Drop your routine. Someone complained? So? "I wrote this song..." What was that crap? You decide where the scam ends? Why can't I? Stop going on about your orgasms. It's obscene. You write love songs, but you don't fuck. Or shoot up. Screw you, J.P. Screw all of you. Go on stage, Jeanne. Get eaten in the lion's den! I'll advise you from behind. Let's change. Save me from these uptight assholes. Mom! Am I bothering you? You don't look great. Are you okay? Yeah. I can't believe you're here. I wanted to see my daughter. I'm so happy. I'm happy too. Mom... I'm not doing well. I'm so sad. I'm confused. I sing to thousands of people but I've never felt so alone. Johanna hates my very existence. Johanna is unhappy. I could tell immediately. Unhappy? What makes you think she's unhappy? Her shoes. Did you see the shoes she had on? I didn't notice. She's had them for three years. I sold them to her for a wedding. So? Tonight her clothes and her attitude were nothing like before, but her shoes were. There's only one reason for wearing those shoes. What? To keep her feet on the ground. Those shoes from home ground her. You're incredible. I love you. So much. Me too. Why did you stay in Decazeville? If the heroine of the story is you, then you'll have to choose between the two... if the heroine of the story is you, then you'll have to choose between the two. You don't need me now. It's between you two. Turn off the fight burning in your eyes. It's overpowering. You lose from the start. The beginning of the end in the silence. You don't need anything where it takes you. I'll take your hand, you barely feel a thing. Thanks. I asked to see you. I love you. Turn out the lights now. It's nice in the dark. The song I just sang says you should never try drugs. That's why I wrote it. It's night. Don't try, or you'll sleep with the angels. Cut her mike. She's capable of anything. You're sure? Start the song. - You have no right! - Let go of me! - You have no right! - Leave me alone! You have no right! Not that song. It's mine. You're high as a kite! My brother died of that shit. You're a junkie now! Go fuck Jeanne. It'll do you both good. It's about acting right. Not about being an asshole with everyone. You get it? Beat it. It's not your problem. Meet me and Jasper at the hotel. You saw what he did and you say nothing? - It's all over. - What do you mean? No more tour, no more songs! - Are you sick? - You are! - Did Jeanne say so? - No! She said I fuck around and do drugs. Are you jealous? I'm talking about your health! Giving rubbers to the audience was my idea. Against AIDS, but not for your personal use. I swear, I'm fine. I promise I am. Jeanne wishes I weren't, but I am. Stop being paranoid! She's the only one who defends you. She never blamed you for anything. That's her thing. Don't you see? She wants me to go crazy or to OD. She wants to get rid of me. And she comes across as a saint! I'm sick of this. It's simple. Tomorrow, if you talk between songs or show up stoned, I'll cancel the concert. - I've spoken to Jeanne. - Obviously. - What's your name? - Herv√©. Let's go, Richard! I love you! I love you! Let me see you. I have a present for you. So nothing will happen. So you'll be protected. So you can get off on the show. To fuck AIDS while you fuck! This is for my best friend, Jeanne. Stop, Jeanne! Where's the saint? Here she is. Facing the whore. - You don't think that. - Sweet Jeanne, the silent, suffering good girl is finished. Dead. Only you think you're good. I don't like you now. You're no friend. What's going on? Johanna wants to fuck you. You're tonight's lucky stud. A short concert means a long night. Not now, J.P.! It's important! Get lost! Stop clinging to me! Mr Montgolfier... What's happened? Was she someone from your family? My poor child! Go away. Go away, Johanna. Go away! Piss off! You want me to stay? No thanks. I need to be alone. For how long? I don't know, J.P. You know I'm here. I know. How will you manage? We'll use tapes. 7 concerts. Then we'll stop. All pre-recorded. It'll be hard without you. I'll get by. Johanna, come out! Two minutes. We can't make them wait anymore. I can't go on. They scare me. It's too late now! We have to go! Where's Jeanne? You don't want to sing? You tell them! Let go of me! You're hurting me! Thank you. It's the best night of my life. I love you. I've never said "I love you" before. What's your name? Cut the mike. Start the tapes up. Where's Jeanne? Back-light her. Happy birthday, from your mother. She'd put it aside just for your birthday. Why didn't you say she was sick? When I saw her last, I didn't ask how she was. I spoke about me. She was very happy with that dinner. Very happy. Being with you was enough. She was your mother. Fairy shoes. How was it? Disappointing, as usual. Why, one day, do we feel different? Who draws the meaning of love in the wind? If the love of no return was worth the detour, I imagine a new meaning for our feelings. Why are you here? I brought it for you. He's a great hunting fish. He knew where you were. I just followed. He was bored without you. Were you bored too without him? Isn't it pretty here? This is where I wrote my first song. And it won't be alone. You see the reflection there? It's a woman. Look at her hair. And there's a man's horse. He's a prince. J.P., can you say that again? I said that in the reflection, you can see a woman and a prince's horse. Why? Is that dumb? Wait... I have to tell you something. Johanna told me about the woman and the prince. Why are you here? Me? I brought the goldfish back. I'm making sure he's treated well. I know, rule 4. Forget that. Johanna jumped out a window. Really? Is she... No, she landed on the awning below. Great publicity. She never needed publicity. You have to see her. Never. She jumped! Go see her! I'll get some coffee. It'll be fine. She's out of danger. I swear on my mother's life! It'd be good if you went. Good for who? For her. I'm into myself now. Yeah, now we're into me. We're into us. Here's the address. I won't go. She loves you. Without you, she won't make it. I want her to. So she can perform again? Because I'm an idiot. All those guys, all those drugs... She was destroying something. She couldn't bear it. I didn't protect her. But I love her. I've loved her from day one. Want me to tell you? Sure... Jeanne, about Francis... Forget him. It was a dream. You don't dream love. You live it. Like singing on stage. The last concert is in Decazeville. I'll be ready. Will you? I have an idea. Roll the dice. Double 6 means you come. You have nothing to lose. Double six. Try again. My baby... I'm so happy, so so happy... You're in for a surprise tonight. Let's wait. I know she'll come. One minute. Johanna's on in 10 seconds. 9... 8... Block everything. Jeanne's here. We're going live... Where are you going? It's been penned that your best friend is in the mirror. But when I look in one, it's you I see on the other side of me. Differences aside, we keep the same stride, walking side by side. If we argue, we can start anew on the other side of you. Only you understand. Only you can know. Only you can wait. Only you believe. Hours on the phone. We're in for no one. Wasted encounters. When we were kids, things were true on the other side of you. You have nothing to prove, I have nothing to gain... What is she doing? Even if it looks like it, it's not love. It's even better... Is she dead? I don't want you to die, Jeanne. You hear me? You can't. I won't let you die! Don't do this to me. If you do, you're a bitch! No, you're not a bitch. I didn't mean it. We have big things in store for us. No, not big things. Small things. But together, they'll seem huge. You can't die. I'll do anything to keep you alive. I'll scream so loud, the whole world will hear. God won't let anyone die anymore. I'm angry, Jeanne. Tell that old asshole I'm angry! I love you, Jeanne. I never knew what love was. Jesus, if you knew how much I love you. Help me. I'll destroy everything if you don't. I just want you to look at me. I've done you such harm. We can't stay here for 10 years. You know how long that is? We'll have kids and we'll travel all over. Please, Jeanne, don't leave me. Don't leave me, Jeanne. Don't leave me!
