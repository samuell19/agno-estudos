Mexico City December 2009 What's wrong, buddy? Come on! Now, you fucking ugly little devil. So you wanted to fuck with me, huh? No, wait, Chucho. -lt's just a pastorela. -Here, take your pastorela. Many Christmases ago, during the conquest of the new world, the Spaniards used theater plays to explain the birth of Jesus Christ to the indigenous people. ln such a play, known as a PASSORELA, the DEVlL tries to prevent, at any cost, the adoration of the Christ Child by the shepherds. As the years passed, the play turned into a very popular comedy, in which the devil is portrayed as the most charming and funniest character of the cast. However, this Christmas, things are about to change... She neighborhood of San Miguel de Nenepilco, in Mexico City. 6,666 inhabitants. Who's there? Don't fuck with me, assholes. l'm a shooting champion. l never miss. Stay there. Fucking Chucho! What a fucking scare you gave me, you bastard! Are you sick or what? Don't complain, man. lt's not that bad. You're going too far, l swear. You always complain. l only wanted to show you the costume. How does it look? So... So what? -Do you like it or not? -lt's okay and all that, but... Halloween is over, Chuchito. Don't joke around. What Halloween? Shis is for the pastorela. Which pastorela? Which pastorela? She one in which you are dressed as God. Shey didn't tell you, right? No, what? We already have the devil, Chucho. What do you mean, ''Already have the devil''? She devil has already been chosen for the performance. You're kidding me, man. Father Benito has always chosen me. He used to choose you. But Father Benito is no longer with us. What happened? Father. Father Benito. Yes. Father Benito! Father? Father. -What did you do to him? -Nothing. We were playing Chinese checkers, drinking rum eggnog and he almost fainted on me. Rum eggnog? Father. Father, Father. Are you okay? What's he saying? She fairies. Father, it isn't the Posadas festival yet. No. Edmundo Posadas. Chuchito, everything is falling apart and you don't even realize it. -Where were you? -At the service, Sister, where else? With the murder of the deputy attorney general, and the holidays going on, no one knows. Yes, that's true, people are feeling bad these days. Shat's why l don't like Christmas. lt's very stressful. With this business of announcing Christmas earlier every year, people get crazy. Shey're pestering us in September already with the trees, the sales, the Santa Clauses, lighting sparklers... Shey should put that all back in December. And in addition everything's colored red, and the music. Why wouldn't they go out and kill each other? Hey, did Father Benito suffer a lot? -No, apparently it happened afterwards. -What? She heart attack, Chuchito. lt was fast, a myocardial attack and he was taken by the Lord. Poor guy. Do you know who's replacing him? -Living Son of God! -Have mercy on me! -Herald of the Kingdom of God! -Have mercy on me! You, who will return to judge the living and the dead. Holy Father Benito. My God is the Holy Cross. Our Savior Jesus Christ. Hello? Excuse me, is this the house of the Calderon family? Yes, it is. Could i speak to Father Edmundo Posadas, please? Sorry, sir, but l think he's a little busy right now. Tell him it's a call from the Archbishop. -lt's a call for Father. -Fuck off, idiot, it's dangerous. But they say it's urgent. -lt's from the Archbishop. -From who? From the Archbishop. Give me that, give me that. Yes? No, no, Your Eminence, it's me. What's happening is that Father Edmundo is a little busy. Shis is getting really bad. Yes, l will tell him. lt's Archbishop Sorquemada. He says it's urgent. Well, dear Edmundo, this is going to be your new home. l hope you like it, and God bless you. But Your Eminence, doesn't it seem very little? Yes, but it was your uncle's last wish. Damn Uncle Benito. -What are you saying? -No, praise and bless him. Do you think l didn't hear you, Edmundo? Father, how am l going to come here so soon? l still have the case of this guy Calderon pending... Please. Not everything is exorcisms and liberations. Shere are also other ways to help the Lord God. Of course, Your Eminence, but... Besides this religious site is very important for us, and we would like it to continue as it is. Do you understand? We are talking about the alms, aren't we? Organizing the musical groups, the patron saint's day festivities, the raffles. But above all the pastorela, which is very important in this neighborhood. But l don't know anything about pastorelas. She only thing you have to do is dress them up in costumes. Make them learn their roles and that's that. Yes, Your Eminence, but... Besides it's extremely important that you make them respect you. So show who's wearing the pants in this community. Above all, when this great event ends, it should be plain to see who's been responsible for it all. Do you understand? Yes, Your Eminence. A lot is expected from the pastorela. Just so you know. Don't lose your nerve on me. Shit. Fuck that coward of a priest. He chose a great time to die. Dad, your language. Well, it's the truth, my girl. You're right. Who would hang up their tennis shoes in the middle of the centenary festivities? Forget the centenary, half... Dad. Low class people, actually. Well, it's the truth, my girl. Shey say he didn't even make it to... Where, Dad? So the pre-Christmas parties, my love. She poor guy was so full of plans, wasn't he? Poor me. l had already put in for my vacation time. Fifteen days, Juarez. Fifteen days in advance? Your eyes are open, but you see nothing. Deputy Attorney General Quesada was just shot in the open at Paseo de la Reforma. And you want your vacation fifteen days in advance? Don't make jokes! Are you going to leave us here alone with all the paperwork? What kind of Christmas spirit do you have? Well, yes, Commander, now they've moved forward the neighborhood festivities and they have always counted on me to be the Christ Child. -Don't kid around, Juarez. -lt's the truth! -l always play the devil, Satan. -Satan? Oh, Juarez. You come up with your stupidities just at the right time. Excuse me, Commander, but l always... You blind dummy, take another piece of brain from the bench there, will you? Yes, Commander. Look, Juarez, if you're not going to help, you're wasting my time. Here are some idiots we will be working with until the 24th. Okay, okay. Let's do it in the name of all those traditions. Shank you very much, Commander. But let's make it clear, Juarez, l want you back on January 6th, before Shree Kings Day. Yes, yes, don't worry. And please, don't be making money on the side out there, -you know me. -How can you believe that, Commander? Well, okay, that's enough. Deliver the plate. Merry Christmas and fuck your mother. Shank you, Commander. According to Father Benito, there's one guy who's spent so many years buttering people up about the fucking performance, well fuck your mother, right? Oh, Dad, it's just a pastorela. What's with you, Magdalena? Shat pastorela is ours. lt's ours. lt's a tradition of the neighborhood, of the town, damn it! Oh, Dad. lf you don't get away for one year, it won't matter. Don't be foolish. What? Just because they changed the fucking priest, they want to change the roles, the tradition, the devil. Yeah. Somorrow that fucking priest is going to hear from me. Based on seniority, it belongs to us, period. l don't think he's going to pay attention to you, Dad. Shey say that this priest is very, very tough. Shey even say he's an exorcist, imagine that. Yeah, a big asshole, right? -l don't know, Daddy, that's what they say. -And so what? Just because he's an exorcist he's not going to scare me. Yes, of course. Besides it's a tradition, period. Well, it'll be whatever you say, but they've even put the pastorela in a competition. No, wait a moment. What about a competition? Yes, since it's the 100-year anniversary of the performance, Father Benito wanted to give it a twist by entering the National Pastorelas Competition. -Don't fuck around, young lady. -Father. She Body of Christ. l said don't fool around. What's this about a competition, if it's just a pastorela, something small, for the community? Nobody told me this was going to be in a competition. She Body of Christ. Shat's what he said on his death bed. And it had to go on with all our strength. Because this year we were going to aim high. Fuck you, Uncle. -Father. -What? She Body of Christ. Listen, Magdalena. Do you think they'll go to the competition without me? l don't know, Dad. Well, what's the matter? What do you mean, ''What's the matter?'' l have to be in this pastorela. Why? How? Just because. Because people want me, they ask for me. Because l'm a classic. Yeah. You should have been at the board meeting. Shey were screaming for you. Chucho has never failed the tradition. Calm down! Calm down! Well, it's just that my buddy is very good. -Just because now he's indisposed... -On duty. Right. Just because my buddy is on duty doesn't mean we are going to take the role away from him. Least of all now we are in a competition. We have to secure a spot for ourselves. Chucho is a sure thing. ln the competition, there is a special prize for the best devil. A trip to Sepetongo for two. l always wanted to go to Sepetongo. We go to Michas. She money for the parish, and the trip for you and whoever you want. How about that? Well, l think it's very good to give someone else a chance, right? Refresh the tradition a little bit and give it some variety. Shat's what l believe. Now Father, l say that if you all would like it, l know the devil's lines. Variety my ass. Damned bunch of ungrateful people. Envious assholes. -And me rehearsing every night. -Enough, please, pops. Somorrow is a school day, please. What fault of mine is it? Somorrow you go and make all your complaints to the priest. See you tomorrow. Take pity on me! Splendor of the light eternal! Take pity on me! Splendor of the light... Yes, hello. Are you okay, Father? Yes, l'm fine. What is it, sweetie? Lieutenant Jesus Juarez Hurtado wants to talk to you. Who? The policeman who has always played the devil in the pastorela. A policeman? Well, yes, Father. Chucho. She... She cop who always plays the devil, every year. What about Chucho? Well, Father, that's his name. Yes, l understood that, but, what does he want? Well, to talk to you about the pastorela. Fine, put him on the phone. Huh? lt's just that he's here, Father. Here? Yes, that's what l said. Shat's fine, Father. Yes, yes, Father. -Can l go in? -Uh, he says that... Forgive me, but he's not here now. He's not here? He's not available right now. lt's just that... lt's that he's very busy. He's going on a trip. lf you want to come next week, after Christmas, he will be happy to see you. Fucking little priest, he's going to see me now. Sorry, Sister, it's a habit. Okay, but l should have been told beforehand. A policeman, man. What a pain! And me leaving him out of the pastorela. You said you weren't interested in anyone who didn't show up, and since he didn't, -he should go... -l know, l know. But people like this are very dangerous. Shey always carry weapons. Shey get excited talking. You should have told me. He could harm me. You should give him another chance. Poor guy, really. This is the second time he has come here in a costume. Yes, my dear. But l can't back down now. l have precise orders to... Father? Father? -Oh, what a fucking scare you gave me... -Sorry. Sorry, Father, that wasn't my intention. No, it was just because of the costume. -What a pity, Father. -No, it's okay, it's okay. So, talk to me. Well, l've come about... l've come about the thing about the devil, Father. -She one in the pastorela? -Exactly. -Look, l've worked on this for many years... -Sorry, my son. Before you continue, you have to understand that l can't fool around with these things. l'm the spiritual leader of this community. l can't just change my mind this way and that. What are people going to say? What are they going to think of me? Let them go to mass, Father. Sradition comes first. Let's have a good devil in the play. Well, yes, my son. Shis is the first one l'm organizing. l can't go around going back on my word. Least of all on such an important occasion. lf not, why did we have the board meeting? So... -Father. -No, no, l'm sorry, Jesus. She role's already assigned. l can't do anything to give it back to you. Why didn't you come to mass? You are awesome, really awesome as that character. You know what? lt's like it's in his blood. Here you are, buddy. l should have been an actor, not a policeman. Do a little bit for us here, so that they can hear you. -No, what are you thinking? -Come on, don't be shy. Sing it? lt's not something to sing. A little bit, only a little. l, infernal serpent, who was expelled because of my pride. l, who began an impious war for the coveted throne, have returned, with subtle malice, to tempt the shepherds, so that the Christ Child will never be adored. But, Father, it's even already all rehearsed. Look at the outfit, the fabric, the details, the quality. Sry to understand, Father. Yes, yes, Chucho. l don't deny your devil looks really good. But l have to deliver the cast list to the sworn jury. Who did they swear to? No, no, the jury of the National Pastorelas Competition, Chucho. She cast list has to be delivered on Monday before noon at the latest. lf not, they will disqualify us. And well, since, basically, you didn't come to the meeting, l said yes... No! -Yes. -No, don't fuck around, Father. l have to be in that pastorela. Look, Chucho, l'm not going to argue with you now. She roles have been assigned and that's all. lf you still want it, there are a pair of shepherds, a Wise King... A king! l'm screwed! l have to play that role! l was born to be the devil. No. lt's clear, Chucho, it's clear. Shere's been enough of your stubbornness. Understand me. l neither can nor want to change the roles. So, with your permission, God bless you, and fuck your mother. l have a lot of work to do. God go with you. PASSORELA COMPESlSlON REGlSSRASlON Get back, Satan. l was only going to take a look at it. Be careful, my dear Chucho. Shat's robbery. -And robbery is a sin. -What? l only wanted to know who got the devil's role. Don't you know it? No. And you really want to know? What, is that also a sin? lt wasn't me, my friend. She people voted for me. l swear. Shey wanted me. ''Shey wanted me.'' Sraitor. Wait, my friend. Since you didn't show up, the priest was there, and stubborn, and he wanted to give out the roles right then. Shey chose me but l didn't want it. -You offered yourself. -No, no, please understand. Calm down, please. Shey gave me the role because l kind of know the lines from participating with you every year. -Shat's the only reason why. -ldiot. My friend. You know how important this play is for me. For both myself and my daughter. Sure, but there will be other years. -Envious assholes, sons of... -Come on, buddy. Anyway there is a little shepherd, a Wise King. lt was a joke, man. Don't mess around, don't get crazy. Don't get crazy! Dad! Did you persuade him? Perro Aguayo Butcher Shop. How may l help you? One-eye? What's happening Chuchito? How are you? Do you miss us already? You know, the holidays always make me feel nostalgic. lt's Chucho. She guys say hello. Oh, give them a hug for me. -Shey say the same to you. -Wish them a merry Christmas. And how are they getting along? Very well, very well, thanks be to God. And with a lot of work. -You know what it's like these days. -Right, man. Listen, One-eye. l want to ask you for a favor among friends. Say the word, brother. What can we do? You overslept, Father. lt's that the alarm clock didn't ring. l have the feeling that somebody cut off the electricity. -Father. -What time is it? -Shey'll close the registration on me. -lt's 1 1 :30. My God! Forgive me, little Mother! lt never fails, it never fails. lt never fails. l'm getting out here. Okay, thank you. May God pay you. Hey, wait. How is God going to pay me? l'm going to get there. My God, a toilet. Hey, little boy, come here. Do you know where the street is for the National Pastorelas Competition? lt's this one, Father. Here, past Nezahualcoyotl, at the corner. Shat's it. Excuse me, Father. lt's a routine check. National Pastorelas Competition. 1 1 :59 am RECElVED Name of the team? Parish of San Miguel de Nenepilco. She Archbishop of Mexico City. How is the world getting along? Shey're going to raise the taxes. Shere are outbreaks of violence all over the country. Another scandal video. -And our jerk of a president... -No, no, no. Not Mundo, the World. Father Mundo. How is he getting along? Who? Father Edmundo Posadas, who was assigned to administer the new parish. Oh, fine. Fine. Fine. He's getting what was expected. l who was expelled for my pride, with me He got rid of exiled angels... -He's turning out great, isn't he? -Well, so-so. She really great one is Chucho. Shat's right. She good one is my Dad. ...to tempt the shepherds, so that the Christ Child would never be adored. lf Hell was... -lf Hell were... -l... -lf Hell were... -l... lf l were Hell, and the Underworld were deep. lf l had the heart to devour myself in eternal punishment. Shat abyss could be compared to me. And Hell would be a Paradise for this poor monstrosity. Princes and magnates, who once were archangels and seraphim, the greatness of Heaven was yours yesterday, and today you see it lost. Wake up, brothers, or stay disgraced forever! Bravo! Who do you think you are? What, you didn't like it, Father? How dare you come to my rehearsals? -But Father, it's only a pastorela, isn't it? -Pastorela, damn! Shis is a lack of respect for me, for my work, for your friends, for the show. Well, l only intended to show you my devil, Father. But, who the hell do you think you are, changing things? -But that's not how the devil is, Father. -So hell with your crap, Chucho. You can't come around teaching me what the devil is like. -But, Father... -l've already told you, Chucho. lf you want to be in my pastorela you'll have to play the little shepherd. -Your pastorela? -Yes, my pastorela? Damn it. How come it's your pastorela if the new one here is you? Whatever. But the stage design, the costumes, and the props all belong to the parish. Yes, which we paid for, with our donations long before you arrived. Yes, that's true. Look, Chucho, keep this up and l'll excommunicate you. -Get out of here before... -Before what? Before what? Huh? Very brave, right? Okay, take your cassock off. Okay, as gentlemen, why not. Let's go outside, you fucking faggot. Let go of me! You'll pay for this, Father. You'll pay, l swear. -Let's leave, dear. -No, but l... -Let's go, l said. -Let go of me! -Let's go. -Listen, Dad, l don't want to... -You too will pay for this. -What? l what? -l what? -l don't want to leave. -Come on, come with me. -No... Dad. So, a pastorela. Yes, Your Excellency. A traditional Mexican pastorela. How lovely. lt's been years since l last saw one. l'd love to see it. Shey even put it in a competition. And how are they? Very good, l suppose, Your Lordship. And you know, the ones who don't like something will leave excommunicated. Especially you two. l have my eye on both of you. What did we do? ''What did we do? What did we do?'' l'm warning you. She next one who rebels against me, will get thrown out. ln God's name, l will throw you out! Go on, girlie, go on and you'll see. -But what did she say? -Shut up, brat. -But... -Don't you know the meaning of shut up? -But... -But nothing. Yeah, don't waste my time. We have to go over the Archangel Michael part. Where the hell is the fucking Archangel Michael? What's the matter? -Nothing. -What? l'm talking to you, Magdalena. What's wrong? -Nothing, Dad. -Nothing? l can see you. What the hell is wrong with you? Magdalena, l'm talking to you. -Nothing, Dad. -Nothing? Am l blind or what the fuck? What's wrong? Magdalena? Dad, it's that l really wanted to participate in the pastorela. Okay, my love. Don't cry. We'll see how we can manage, but we'll be in our pastorela. Prince of Shad... Prince of Shadows. Lord of the Underworld. -Father. -She Underworld... With this guy it's going to be really hard even to get into the semi-finals. Did you say the semi-finals? lt's just preselection. -How did we choose him? -Did we? He seemed great to you, Benito, since he was the son of the Avenging Angel, he would be the Archangel Michael. No, man. Look how great he is. See, Father, it's because you were stubborn about assigning the roles. l would have changed him and no one would even have noticed. Father Edmundo change his mind? Never. Holy Mother! But who played the Archangel before? -She devil, Father. -She devil? Yes, Father. She one who is playing the devil used to play the Archangel. And because you promoted the Archangel to Devil, now you see how it is. -What role did this man have before? -A tree. A tree? Father, do you want me to say it again? Fuck your mother. i need you to live. Herman. Watch out Santa Claus! Watch out! Moving on to other news. The press has been informed that the Parish of the neighborhood of San Miguel de Nenepilco will open the sixth National Pastorelas Competition. Directed by their new pastor Father Edmundo Posadas, who will be in charge of giving new life to the traditional December play that has been celebrated in our country for over 100 years. Dad? -Shey're looking for you. -What? Shey're at the door looking for you. lf they're from the police station, tell them not to fuck around, that l'm not on duty now. Shis is my vacation. No, it's Father Edmundo. So what does that asshole want now? l think he came to apologize. Don't fuck around, Magdalena. lsn't it obvious l'm busy? Sell him no problem. He can go give midnight mass. He shouldn't fuck with me now. Can't he see what time it is? l think he wants to give you another role. Don't come to me with that story, Magdalena. -Don't come to me with that... -Chucho. Chucho, look. l need... We need you and Magdalena to come back to the pastorela. Forgive me for not being able to give you the role of the devil because we'd already given it to your pal. And l can't back down on my decisions. But another role, that l believe may interest you, has become available. What do you think, l'm stupid? -Nothing. -Nothing. What, you liked it or what the fuck? What? -l didn't say anything. -Shen shut up. -You started it. -Shut up. l'm being quiet, aren't l? What the fuck? Are you provoking me, asshole? No. Shere it is. See? Shere it is. What? Shat's why l've always liked you, you worthless fucking chauffeur. You'll see how awesome l'm going to be as the Archangel Michael, asshole. l have no doubt about it. -What? -l have no doubts. -Good luck. -Shut up, asshole. -Jesus, l only said l'm being quiet. -What the fuck? What the what? l just said l hope it goes great for you. Well, let's rehearse the piece where Lucifer and Michael have a battle, ready? -Aren't you going to read it, son? -Don't worry, Father. We have this scene really well rehearsed, don't we, Bulmaro? Just remember it's just a show, buddy. But everything's okay. You're going too far, fucking Chucho. Sorry, dear brother. l swear l didn't realize what l was doing. l couldn't control it. Oh yeah. ''l couldn't control it. l couldn't control it.'' She priest already told us to be careful, dude. l didn't hear him. With that shrill voice of his, l couldn't even hear him. Oh, yeah. ''l didn't hear him.'' No problem. lf you don't feel well for the opening, l'll replace you, of course. -Yeah, you'd like that. -Well, then don't complain, asshole. You act like you're about to die, right doctor? No, just five or six little stitches. Father. How is he doing? He'll be under observation for a week. A week? And today the competition people come to see a general rehearsal. But why for a week? Listen, Chucho, it's just an injury. How am l going to justify these tests if nothing's wrong with him? Godinez, it seems we don't understand each other, right? Do you want to lose your license again? Look, Chucho, l can keep him here as long as you want, okay? lf you want we can also hide him in the psychiatry ward, but, man, an enema? How am l going to justify an enema if he just hit his head? l don't know. l don't know. But if that asshole gets out of this clinic in less than three days, you're going to be in trouble, Godinez. -You're going to be in trouble. -But, what did he do? lt seems he was the third one who shot Colosio. You're kidding, Juarez. Who's going to believe that? Sell me, what did he do? He's the murderer of the deputy attorney general. What? Quesada's killer? She one that was killed in broad daylight? -Seriously? -Yes, it seems so. And don't tell anybody. Shat's why l need you to keep him until Shree Kings Day. lt's important he not be seen by the commander or anybody else of his group, because my connection would chicken out. You kept your secret well, fucking Juarez. Work with me and maybe Santa Claus will even bring you a little present, okay? Dr. Juan Perez, please call the main desk. it's possible he has had a stroke, he will be under observation, and he has to rest, at the very least, for a week. A week. You messed up, Chucho. Look what you've done. You injured your own buddy? Father, he was supposed to know. Why didn't he move? lt's the same every year. Well, l believe that with the change of roles, he got thrown off. Because l always would move to the left to receive the punch. But him, he moved to the right, to the other side. How can you explain that? -My God. -Father. -What am l going to do? -Father! Father. Shey're coming, the jury from the pastorelas festival. Shit. What happened? Aren't you with the commander? No, no, it doesn't matter. lt's better. You won't believe this. But l think Chucho is making money on the side somewhere out there. Listen, dude. How much money for information about the deputy attorney general's killer? Dressed as a devil? Fucking Juarez. No kidding, Miramontes. She one that killed the deputy attorney general? You bet he did, it's obvious. Chuchito Juarez. Don't struggle, please. She reward is 660,000 pesos? Undercover in a December pastorela? Chucho Juarez Hurtado? Commander, we've found the murderer! Get out of there! -We are not going to do anything. -So, leave me alone. Me neither. Me neither. -He's dangerous. Back off. -Okay. Back off! Get back or l won't be responsible. Back off, doctor! Welcome to the convent of San Miguel de Nenepilco. l'm going to introduce you to the new priest. Father Posadas. She jury of the Pastorelas Competition. Mother. Father. How good of you to come. We were finishing a general rehearsal. l see. Beautiful costumes. -Very pretty. -l made it myself, Mother. And your devil? Wait, you're in costume. Not like that, they might disqualify us. l asked you about your devil. -A certain... -Bulmaro Villafuerte. -Shat's it. -Bulmaro Villafuerte, he's... He's in the bathroom. -You, calm down! -lt's an enema! Get back! Get him! Get him! We have a 10-30 on Manuel irante Avenue. We are chasing the individual on foot. He seems to be a petty thief. l bet you 20 pesos he doesn't catch him. Cool, it's a bet. Any changes in the cast, Father? -Well, look... -Father! Father, it's Bulmaro, he's coming here, he's okay, he wants you to wait for him. What? lt's Bulmaro, Father. Yes, but where is he? On the phone, Father. Where else? Yes. -Father Edmundo? -Yes, my son. Where are you? Don't worry, Father. l just got out of the hospital. l'll be there. Sell the people from the competition l'm coming. l'm fine. l'm in good health. Can you hear me? Yes, but where are you? Downtown, but i'm coming there. But where? But, Mother, aren't you going to stay to see the rehearsal? Sir, l don't want to be rude to you, but l have 66 pastorelas registered. So you can thank the Lord that we came to see you. Welcome, Agent Juarez. Bulmaro, where are you? Bulmaro, are you okay? Bulmaro, answer me. Help! Commander, this is the one we've agreed is the presumed murderer. i repeat, we have a 10-30. The subject is dressed in red, has a tail and is wearing horns. What did you say? A tail and horns, Commander. And what the fuck are you waiting for? Move it, you stupid guys. Calling. -Hello, Chucho. -What's going on, Godinez? l can't tell you anything. Couldn't you keep this a secret just for an hour? What a problem! What did you expect, Juarez? Shat dude is very fucking tough. He disarmed five nurses and two security guards. lt's not for nothing he managed to kill the deputy attorney general. Now the whole fucking department's looking into my Christmas bonus? -You're a dead man. -Detonation activated. Chucho! Hey, Chucho? Chucho! Check even the last pastorela and Halloween in this city. But Commander, it's already December. l don't give a shit! l want every single devil behind bars before sunset. Yes, Commander. All special units are ordered to apprehend any subject, individual or such person dressed in red, wearing horns. Leave me alone! Shank you, partner. We'll take care of it. -But l didn't... -But nothing. Aren't we colleagues? Yes, say it. Shut up, asshole. Oh, my little horns. Listen, officer, but he didn't... You can see, partner. He has to be wearing horns. But he's dressed in red, he could be... Yes, but he must be wearing horns. Well, let's make sure. Get out of the way! Back off! ldiot. Get back, lady! Select a weapon. Type of weapon selected. Have a good day. Shere goes the devil! Shere goes the devil! Watch out! Get in! Target captured. We lost the suspect, Commander. Shey reached Sepito. Right in the main square of Mexico City there was a gunfight involving public security agents, the police, and it is possible that this incident is related to the murder... Father. And l thought that he was happy with his character. Who could've known he would become so stubborn, right? Who would've known? You can't have it all. Without the devil, without the Archangel. Father. But you saw that Chucho is good. -We can still win. -Well, with persistence. But he was kicking the nativity scene and all that, Sister. Well, whatever, we need him. Do you really believe that he's doing this for the community? For the sake of tradition? -Oh, no? -Well, no, Father. Haven't you realized that what he actually wants is to show that he's the boss here? Our dear priest is the new one. As you wish, Father. She one who has never betrayed tradition is Chucho. Whatever happens he will be here to win the competition. Chucho. No, Father. l'm Magda, Chucho's daughter. How are you, dear? How are you? Well, so-so, Father. Excuse me, do you know anything about my dad or his friend? You know, they haven't arrived yet. No, they haven't come here, dear. l'm also waiting for them. We are desperate. We don't know what we are going to do. She presentation is tomorrow. And we haven't been able to rehearse the pastorela, not even once. Father, i'm still just hanging on waiting. Shey haven't called you, dear? No, Father, nothing. Nothing more than the news report. Blessed Lord. Father, maybe something happened to them? Do you think they're okay? Commander, it seems there were some problems with the operation. Obviously. We ended up with our hands empty and nothing got done. Not precisely, Commander. United Hell, it will never be defeated! Shey've been like this ever since they got here. Commander, another report from the Plaza de la Constituci?n. -ls that all? -lt seems it was Chucho. Chucho Juarez. -Shey identified his car, Commander. -Which one? -Mine? -Chucho's, sir. lt was expected. Fucking Juarez, he's a genius. He kept it all for himself. He really did? Do we know anything else about the deputy attorney general's killer? No. She devils seem not to know anything. However, something disturbs me. Don't fuck with us, buddy. She murderer of the deputy attorney general? l'm not even capable of killing a fly. Yes. But you are capable of stealing my role. Asshole. You're kidding, Chucho. lt's just a fucking pastorela. lf it's such a big deal, you stay as the devil and l play the Archangel, but tell them l didn't kill him. And what did you say, this dude has already been caught? -What do they say? -Shat you're a faggot and a fan of America. -Just tell me, Chucho. -Shey are still looking for you. Fucking devil. Nothing is wrong. When they make you play the piano they will realize it's not you. Shey are not so stupid either. And what are we going to do? Now we are going to rehearse. What? Man, don't fuck around. She police are chasing us and you want to rehearse. l'm a policeman, so cool it. -But Chucho... -Come on. l don't want what happened six years ago to happen again. Look, Chucho, it wasn't my fault that we got so drunk. Come on, let's get started. -But Chucho. -''Chucho'', fuck it. Come on. Oh, well, okay. Oh, Archangel Michael. Finally we've come to meet in this field... What's the matter, asshole? -Now what? -Shis is my part. -But haven't we agreed? -No way. l'm the devil. What the fuck, Chucho? And what about the costumes? You take care of your character. lt's about what happens inside, your motivations. She business of the costumes we'll deal with later. Don't fuck around, Chucho. l need the costumes to get into the mood. Otherwise... Let's start. Read the Archangel Michael part. Okay. Just lend me the sword or something, so l'll feel myself more in the situation... -Chucho. -What? Your sandal is open. Fucking traitor chauffeur. Now, yes, you fucking ugly little devil. -So you wanted to screw me. -No, wait, Chucho. -lt's only a pastorela. -Here's your pastorela. Wait, friend! Wait! Shat's all, Chucho. Or else they won't get our merchandise. One-eye? Shis is really bad, fucking Chucho! You were about to leave us out. And we were even doing you favors in the middle of the holidays. What a crummy Christmas. No, it's okay. lt's okay. l went too far, One-eye. But if you want your share, you should keep this dude hidden until the Posadas are over. You're kidding. Keep him hidden? He's more than ruined. Everybody knows this guy killed the deputy attorney general. -And Colosio. -Don't fuck around, Chucho. She commander and three other agencies are out for your little head. Shere's also a reward out for you. Fuck the commander. What a lack of trust. Let's not play assholes, Chucho. Who will you give him up to? Who is your contact? Who is the good one? -Chucho? -Father Mundo? Excuse me, Your Eminence, l thought it was somebody else. What happened, dear Mundo? You already hear the Virgin talking to you, don't you? No, Your Eminence, how can you believe that? Can i be of any service? No, dear Mundo. Nothing important. Just checking how you are. How is the parish doing with the collections and the pastorela? Good. Good. Everything's going great. lf you could see how lovely it's turning out. One-eye, wait! Let me explain! Shat's great my dear Mundo! l'm also calling because here at the archbishopric l was telling them about the pastorela and the competition and they're very interested in seeing the work. -No. -Yes. The Cardinal is so enthusiastic that he insists on going to the event himself. l hope you don't mind. No... l mean, it would be no bother. And then for the whole archbishopric, i would grant them some favors, of course. Yes, but you know how Your Eminence is. Besides, he said it was a lovely Christmas present. -Can you believe it? -How stingy, don't you think so? Yes. Well, my dear Mundo. Rest well. You have a lot to do for this great event. We'll see each other tomorrow at the competition. God willing, Your Eminence. Good night. Don't cry, my dear. He must be out there somewhere. You know how your father is. No, my dad is not like that. He always warns me, even when he's very drunk. Dear girl. But that's how it is. He always warns me. Least of all now with the event of the pastorela. Shese days he doesn't even drink. Really? Both he and his friend have disappeared. -Villafuerte? Really? -Yes. And you know what's the worst? Shat we are participating in the National Pastorelas Competition and we have neither the Archangel nor the devil. National Pastorelas Competition 7:55 pm Nothing. Father, Chucho is not going to make it here. But don't worry, stay calm. No, but it's going to destroy me. Dear Father, keep your faith up, you'll see, Chucho will arrive. My God, my God. Let's go. Let's go. Chucho is going to make it. What nonsense! He'll be here! Boss? She contact of Juarez is here. Excellent. Don't let him out of your sight. We're on our way. How exciting, a pastorela! Father Mundo says it's turning out really lovely. Am l correct, Sister? Oh, yes, you can't imagine. Our version is the best. She one from San Miguel de Nenepilco, you'll see. We couldn't expect less from Father Mundo. How exciting! lt's been a long time since my last traditional Mexican pastorela. You won't regret it. lt will be unforgettable. Go ahead. Shit. Hurry up, we aren't going to make it! Well, stop moving, you fucking dwarf. Get going, Chucho, they're going to start the pastorela. Fuck! How can you believe they will start without the devil? DlSQUALlFlED l'm sorry, the rules are very clear. lf by the second call the cast is not complete, you're out. But, Mother, please understand, they won't be late. Next one. What do we do, Father? l don't know! Who should l put in? Don't you know the lines? Father, Don Gumercindo says he still doesn't know the Archangel's lines. And that if you want him to change... No, no. Father, Father! Mother Superior wants to see the cast before the first call. My God! What am l going to do? Chucho, my son! Where were you? What happened to you? What's wrong? Nothing, Chucho, nothing. We don't have a devil. Bulmaro is not here. You should help us, for your mother's sake. You should save the pastorela. lf you wish, l could replace my friend in the role. Really, Chucho? Really? Of course, Father. Don't worry. l know the lines by heart. And if you want, you could be the Archangel, and give me the responses. l'll be the Archangel and give you the responses? Shank you, Chucho. Of course, dear Father. Without resentment or envy. You are here to fulfill your obligations as a man, as a good Christian. -As an actor... -Chucho! Chucho! You are talking to yourself again. Don't fuck around, we aren't going to get there. lt's only a question of time, buddy. Sooner or later that fucking priest will have to give in. But first the handcuffs should come off. Right! One, two, three! Fuck! And now? Father, are you a man or what? Yes, but l'm also a priest. How come you think that l... Besides, Chucho is very good. What if he arrives? But, he won't arrive. No, no, no. A priest like this, no, no. But Father, what's wrong, man? lt's just pretend. Understand this once and for all. Fuck that damned Chucho. Save the tradition. Save San Miguel Nenepilco. Save your people, Mundo. Chucho! Dad! -Chucho! -How's it going? Dad, where were you? Working, my love, working. Don't call me my love! You've got us all scared. What happened to you? She commander was at our place, Dad. Shey're looking for you all over the city. Yeah. Where is the priest? l need to talk to him. Shey are also looking for Bulmaro. What did he do? Nothing. He just killed the deputy attorney general. Buddy! Open this for me, buddy! What? Nothing will happen to him. Where is the priest? l need to talk to him very seriously. Are you going to tell me where he is or not? Father. Forgive me, Father. l had to be absent because of an emergency at my job. You know how they are at the police station. Where is Bulmaro? He's extremely drunk. l was expecting it. Are you ready? Yes, Father. For whatever you ask for. For whatever is offered. lf you want me as the angel, that's what l will be. lf you want me as the Wise King, l will be a Wise King. lf you want me as the devil, l will be the devil, Father. Chucho. Yes, Father? Do you really want to participate? lt would be an honor, Father. Well, fuck off, Chucho. Because this year... l, V?ctor Edmundo Posadas, am going to be the devil in this pastorela. Fuck off, Chucho! l don't want to see you here ever again. Out of my sight. Out of my play. Shere's no place for you in this pastorela. Fuck off, you demon! Sake him away. Did you notice, partner? What? Each time there are more nasty little devils. No shit. How come? What happens is, when they get excited they seem more numerous. l don't remember having put so many in. -Come on. -What? Get out, you asshole! What time is it? Nine before 9:00. No shit, it's about to start! No, it's already started. Without us. What? Are you nuts? What are you doing? You wanted your devil, didn't you? So now, he's going to show up. Satan, l know your strengths! As you know mine! Since your power is what God tolerates, mine is double that strength! So that you will surrender at my feet. Father, listen, that's my line. Shut up, you stubborn horse. Shis pastorela is under my control. And if you want to fuck with me, l will control you with a scream. So the Underworld, little shepherds! Christmas is over! Can you see? She bastard was already dressed as the devil. Damn little priest, you really kept that to yourself. Who would have thought it? Well, he was using us to end up with the pastorela for himself. How shameless! And whoever is rehearsing for him, like an ass, the damned little priest will fuck them up. Let's go. Listen, Chucho, they are laughing a lot, but anyway we're winners. Shut up. She tradition needs to be saved, that's all. Angel Caido, Commander Angel Caido. Angel Caido in position. Do you have a visual of target three? Confirmed. Visual contact with target three. Waiting for instructions. l don't want you to lose sight of him, not for one second. Understood?

As soon as the deputy attorney general's killer shows up, on my signal, let the firing begin. Okay, Commander. Friends! Down with the abuses! Down with the injustices, the big frauds with which they are trying to finish off our customs! Our traditions! Our dignity! Better free in Hell than servants in Paradise! My friends! Long live the Underworld! Long live! Long live Satan! Long live! Long live Lucifer! Long live! Long live the city of Soluca, dudes! And thus, once again, evil wins over good. So that the Christ Child may never be adored. Stop there! Stop, Prince of Darkness! Get your sword ready to return to Hell, and to the stinking depths from which you should have never emerged. Gumercindo, why are you doing this to me? l know your strengths, Satan, as you know mine. Your power is what God tolerates, and mine is double yours, so that you will surrender at my feet.
