The soul, I give it to the Gods in heaven. The arms, I give them to the righteous King. The heart, I give it to my wife and mother. The honour, I keep it to myself. Hey. Hey. Stop. Stop. Singh. Bow down. Singh. Bow down. Don't look at King Sua. Or you will lose your head. Viset Chaicharn, Ang Thong district, B.E.2236 What are you waiting for? I want to get there by dusk. Don't be lazy. Get up. Get up. Row. Lord Pichai's house, B.E.2236 Now you take a break. You can do what you want. I don't have a plan tonight. I wish to go to old man Aum's, sir. Hmm. You probably want to get drunk. Fine by me. You won't prohibit you. Yes, sir. Just go, then. Again. You rotten rascal. Old man Aum, give me a drink. You didn't pay last time. Oh, don't worry about it. Kong will pay today. Hey, Tomya. Why should I pay for you? Because you're my pal. OK. Tomya. Nual. Did you notice Singh's face? When he was walking toward you, but you pretended not to look. He seemed totally dejected. I don't care. Really? Of course. Why should I care? He never cares about me. Or do you want anyone, Mali? Tomya. Tomya? I'd like it on my head first, Venerable. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. What are you doing, Singh? That's for the monks. He's shy. Singh, dry them for me please. Go. What are you looking at? Go. Let's go for a swim. Who will go with me? - I'm going. - Me too. Auntie, please take care of it. Mali. Reng. Reng, Be more strict. Hard... Harder Good. Back. Yes, that's right. Strike with knee! Reng. Is Singh here yet? Not yet, sir. Oh, he's here now. Alright. You are here already. Reng, train him well. His boxing skill is actually second to none in this district. But his style is quite unorthodox. He will need you to train him. Yes, sir. Come on, Singh. Not bad. Not bad. You defend well. But should attack more. So smart. You're good, Singh. Your punch is hard and tight. You got me. First rule, don't underestimate your opponent. Come on. Hey, that's it? What are you looking at? Keep practicing. Sir. Are you going to set up a boxing school? No. I only want to train the villagers so they can defend themselves. Defend themselves or defend against someone? Against the thieves. Those soldiers from Ayutthaya. The royal soldiers? You must not mean the royal guards of King Sua. Why do you have to be suspicious of them? Are you saying that they rob the villagers? I heard that the royal guards frequently go out to collect tax from villagers. Anyone who doesn't comply will be taken as slaves. They take even the cattle. I am certain they will come to our village soon. Hard to believe it is the order of His Majesty. Whether it's true or not, we have to be ready. When the royal guards come, we will fight until our last breath. King Sua kill people at will. Obsessed with sexual affairs. When he likes any female, the soldier will force her from home. Just to satisfy his sexual desire. Oh my. Where did you get that from? I also heard that he has a special interest in young girls before puberty. Twelve or thirteen years of age. If any of them resists or cries out from pain, he will stab a dagger into her chest and order the royal page to take the body out through the ghost gate. And feed her to the vultures. Hard to believe. This King Sua is a cruel monarch. Brutal, ruthless, inhumane. He plotted to take the throne from King Narai for his father-in-law. Sutasawan Palace, Lopburi Province Sutasawan Palace, Lopburi Province I know that well. Sutasawan Palace, Lopburi Province Sutasawan Palace, Lopburi Province Don't forget. I used to serve under King Narai. Don't forget. I used to serve under King Narai. I was there when King Sua, then under the title of Lord Sorasak, robbed the throne. King Narai only had a handful of soldiers who served him inside the Suttasawan palace. I was one of those soldiers. Why don't we arrest Lord Sorasak for execution so he won't be a threat to your throne, Your Majesty? With only fifteen soldiers? We are willing to sacrifice our lives, Your Majesty. You would all die as you wish. And no one would be able to escape. And it was as His Majesty's predicted. Throne Hall of House Palace, Lopburi Province Now His Majesty is severely ill. Once he perishes, I, as his son, will take up the throne. Do you want to be on my side? Anyone who resists will be executed. Tell me what you want to do. We all have considered and concurred that only Your Highness deserves the throne, after King Narai has perished. Because Your Highness is a son of His Majesty. Is there anyone who disagrees? Not at all, Your Highness. His Majesty has issued a royal command to collect the following tax. Bring the farm land tax collection for two chang per field. Disobedience will result in confiscation of properties. Money, cattle, rice, or offspring as slaves. Because you refuse to pay the tax, I have the duty, assigned by His Majesty, to punish you as an example of disobedience. Soldiers, burn this village down. Go on. Burn everything. Go. Go! Burn it. Burn everything. Burn everything. Open the gate now. Something has happened. What is it, Dum? The royal guards have burned down Dong Noon village. They took all the cattle. Oh, my goodness. We have to fight them, my lord. If not, this land will burn. The royal guards have crossed the line. When did this happen? Just a short while ago. Now it's time to use the fighting skills you have been trained. - Master Reng. - Yes, sir. Get the swords out and give them to each one of us. Take the horses and meet here. Yes, sir. The royal guards took my daughter away. She was only 13 years. They will bring her to the king. They went the way of the palm trees. Singh. Follow them. The palm trees. Yes, sir. Hey. Go. Stop. Old man, have you seen the soldiers with the cattle and the villagers from Dong Noon passing by this area? They were just loading the properties at Ta Sai a while ago. Quick! Go. Run away. Don't let the royal guards capture you. Go! What are you talking about? Don't you realize that the royal guards have come to collect tax at Dong Noon village. And ended up burning down the whole village. Collecting tax, and why did they burn down the village? I'm not sure. But I heard that they didn't get to bring the stolen properties back. They were robbed before they got back. The thieves took all of the stolen properties. All of them. Wait. Who are the thieves? Are they from our village? Think about it. Last night, Tomya didn't come back home. And Pim told me that Kong didn't come back home as well. They usually go in a pack anyway. Singh, Kong, Tomya, and Plod. Did Singh go with them last night? How should I know? I'm not his father or mother. Not his father or mother, but his... Watch your mouth, Mali. Hey, he's here. Let's ask him. Singh. Singh. I have something to ask you. What is it? Last night, the soldiers who collected tax from Dong Noon were robbed. Did you have anything to do with this? How should I know, Mali? Is it true, Singh? Of course. But why Chin, Kong, and Plod all went out all night. Did they do with you? We went to... a cockfight at Natajun. Is it true, Singh? Of course. Why do you keep asking? Sin, the Lord asked for you. Hurry up. I have to go. The Lord called for me. It's already late. Go. Nual. I think Singh didn't tell the truth. Do you think that Singh, Kong, Tomya, and Plod are all thieves who robbed the royal guards? Who knows? They always do something recklessly. A little bit of cheering up, they could do anything. Found it? Are these all yours? Oh, hey. Look at these things. See if they are yours. Don't take the things that are not yours. They have totally crushed us this time. They seemed to know where we were going. Their master must be a knowledgeable person. Clever, slick, and brave. I really want to know who he is. He might be useful to us. Noi river, Viset Chaicharn, Ang Thong district Hey, is that the sound of flute and drum for a boxing match? Can you hear it? You are right, Your Majesty. I have learned that at this moment, A nearby village in Viset Chaicharn district is holding a festival. I heard that they have a boxing contest. Good. Let's see them fight. Probably not a good idea, Your Majesty. We only have a handful of royal guards. If anything happens, we will be in trouble. I don't think it is a good idea, Your Majesty. I agree with Lord Pijit, Your Majesty. That's true, Your Majesty. Who said I can't go? I rule over this land. Am I not the lord of life? Yes, Your Majesty. As a soldier, every time I hear the sound of flute and drum I get goosebumps all over. Why is that, Your Majesty? Are you sick, or is it time to drink? Ooh. Then you should have had a couple of drinks before coming here. Not like that. I'm a boxer too. Whenever I hear boxing music I want to fight. Ouch!! This is Tong-On, your royal servant. Do you think I can still fight with local fighters? Yes, you can fight, Your Majesty. But I'm afraid that the result might not be desirable, Your Majesty. Damn you, Tong-on. You have seen me fight. It's because all of the boxers who had fought you knew who you were. So they didn't fight with full energy. If you think those boxers didn't fight me seriously, I will fight some local boxers. Anyone knows who you are. They can tell that you are a noble person. Someone important from the capital. Don't worry. Hey. Come here, you two. Yes. You two. Come here. Do you know who I am? Hey. He's King Sua. Huh? King Sua. The one who is as fierce as a tiger? Yes, this person. King Sua. What does King Sua want from villagers like us? You must act like we are villagers. Just like we are pals, or brothers. Do you remember how to call me? Dua. Yes. Practice that. Call me again. Tid Dua. Tid Dua. Tong-on. I'd like to have this girl as a wife. You want Nual as your wife? Then you must ask her brother over there. Nual's brother is Nark. Nark the Iron Shin. He's the district's champion. Never lost to anyone. Kong from Viset Chaicharn is the winner. Pupil of Master Peuk and Master Mee. Referee. There's a boxer from the city. He wants to fight in your ring. Where? Where's the boxer? It's me. My name is Tid Dua. Oh, old man. Are you sure? A man your age should just sit and watch. You would faint in the ring. Don't underestimate me just yet, pal. I might not be young, but my heart never gives up. How is His Majesty doing right at this moment? Don't you worry about His Majesty. He has Tong-on along with him. That guy always finds a way out. But I am not so sure he can get His Majesty out of trouble. I want to challenge Nark the Iron Shin. I don't want any prizes. I only want his sister as the reward. Is it you who dares to challenge me? Do you dare to have your sister as the prize? A guy like me, Nark the Iron Shin, never fears anyone. But about Nual, my sister. It's up to her heart. Nual. Nual. Something's happened. What is it? Your brother is about to fight a stranger from the city. So what? Why do you have to tell me? Because you are the prize of this match. He said he doesn't want any prizes. He only wants you. It's him, Nual. The boxer from the city who wants you as the prize. What rights does he have? But as old man like him will get kicked around by Nark. Is there any other good boxer in Viset Chaicharn? Not even a full round and my boss Tid Dua sent your best boxer to the ground. Is there anyone else who wants to prove your boxing skill with Tid Dua from the city? Is there anyone else? I'm a local boxer. I wish to learn from the city boxer. Maybe you can give me some advice. Alright. I will give you a break. Don't. Give me all you have. You might have defeated Nark, but you won't defeat me. If you aim to take Nual, you must first defeat me. Alright. The winner gets sister of Nark the Wooden Shin. The loser gets out of the way. I'm not a cow or a buffalo. So you can use me as a boxing prize. Start. End of the round. Singh. Wait until I'm fully rested. Then we fight each other again. Sooner or later, Nark's sister must be mine. What's so hard about it? Let's decide it now. If you fight again, it will be a draw. You'll both get hurt. What do you want to do? We'll figure it out. But shouldn't we enjoy other parts of the festival? That's Lord Rachasongkram. What business does he have here? It doesn't matter why he is here, Your Majesty. The thing that matters is that he knows you, King Sua. You're right. Lord Rachasongkram cannot see us. He will blow our cover. Follow me, Tong-on. What are you doing here, old man? Are you hiding? What did you do? Did you do something wrong? No. We just don't like those folks. City people like you don't like them either? That King Sua must be really horrible. Hey. You don't seem to like King Sua. Who can love him? The villagers around here can't even stand his name. He is as hated as a leprous dog. But don't worry about this. Let's find something to drink. Then we can watch the rocket contest at the temple. All the girls in Viset Chaicharn will be there. Today is a big celebration of all districts in Viset Chaicharn. We two are old people. We don't worry about the girls. That's fine. If you don't want to look at girls, we'll find something to eat. Alright. That's something I want to hear. Please sit down, Your Highness. Go get the tea from Shantou to serve Lord Rachasongkram. Hurry up. Alright. Thank you. Now is a chance to give you a proper welcome. Good. Good. Hey, Lord Pichai. You used to work for me. And we were friends for a long time. I know you are an able person. It was an honour to serve you. No need to. At ease, Lord Pichai. Oh, hey. My tax collectors were robbed by a group of skilled thieves. Much more royal guards were killed than last time. Is that so, Your Highness? So why are some of the royal properties in your house? Ah, but that's alright. It's negotiable. Lord Pichai, don't you know that this is an act of treason. Death punishment. I confess to the crime. Please do as you should do. Do you think a wise senior official like me can't see that the people are in trouble? Can't see King Sua's cruelty and immoral behavior? Your Highness. What exactly do you mean by that? I've made up my mind. Whenever I have a chance, I will execute King Sua. But now I don't have enough men. Huh, Your Highness? Yes. Don't be alarmed. I need more men. I need a strategist like you. You and I have been friends for a long time. Your Highness. Are you saying that you are plotting a treason? Right. Lord Pichai. What do you say? Will you join me, or die as a traitor? Make a choice. Oh, be careful. Come. Come. Come. You said that you hate King Sua. Why? King Sua terrorizes the villagers. When is the ghosts going to punish him? Well, I hope you are not his supporter. Hey, no need to suspect me. I don't like to see people getting oppressed. Don't worry. I'm not his supporter. Tell me. How have you been oppressed? City people are so stupid. You must not know that each month, the King sends his soldiers to collect tax. The villagers get extorted indefinitely. One day they built the palaces. Another day they dug the canal. Then one day they built the roads. Anyone who disobeyed were whipped or killed. Daughters need to be hidden. Or they will be forced into the palace. He doesn't like mature women. Young girls only. Such a bastard. He is such a bastard that I should call a son of a bitch. Maybe his name has been used without his knowledge. I don't have anything to prove. I'm just telling you how I and other villagers feel. Maybe he really doesn't know. But if he really doesn't know, then he is the stupidest King for getting fooled every day. Oh, damn it. No more. Wait here. I'll get some more. Talking about that King Sua makes me upset I want to kick someone. Wait here. Hurry up. Hey, Tong-on. Your Majesty. I must really be a fool. Got lied to for a long time. This is not lying. This is conning. You got conned. Your Majesty. Why didn't you tell me? Can I tell you? A head is something to keep. Not only Your Majesty that can make it fall off my shoulder. There are other people that Your Majesty gave power to. Oh. I got goosebumps talking about this. What a miserable king I am. I thought the people love me. Why haven't hundreds of people who got paid by me told me the truth that the people are suffering? I must get all the detail from him. Hey, did you get it, Singh? Not easy to get one. The police are strict these days. We'd better go get some at old man Aum's. Let's go now. Hey. Maybe later. The boat race is about to begin. I am also in the race. You, really? Really. I'm the steersman of the Viset Chaicharn. Is your boat any good? Five years, never lost. But I'm not sure about this year. We've lost a rower. I'll replace him. Do you know how to row? Hey, I have rowed even in the ocean let alone the river. Then follow me. Let's go. Wait for me. Your Highness. I saw His Majesty and Tong-on, sir. Huh? What did you say? His Majesty came all the way to Viset Chaicharn? I really saw them, sir. His Majesty dressed like a commoner. It's hard to believe that King Sua would do that. Have you forgotten it? His Majesty likes to go hunting and fishing in many places. Sometimes he disguised himself to fight local boxers. Actually, I have heard that too. But are you sure that it's King Sua? I'm certain, sir. Then it's like the lion walking into the hunter's trap. Hey, Singh. Your Viset Chaicharn boat is really not bad. I must also thank you too. If not for you, the Viset Chaicharn wouldn't have won. Actually you're both good. I'm not that good, Singh. But your steering skill is second to none. I've never seen any steersman as good as you. I have never heard anyone sing as well as her. Hey, listen only. Do not court her. She is someone I have eyes on. Singh, does she love you? If she is not in a relationship, anyone can court her. Tong-on, this lady must be my wife. Over my body. Alright. You and I, let's fight another round. The winner gets her. Ok. Alright. Singh. Go. Alright. Let's decide it now. Alright. Let's do it now. Alright. Who wants to bet on Tid Dua? I'll bet on Singh. Come on, Singh. Inside. Inside. Tid Dua. Fight. Don't give up. Inside. Hey. What are you two doing? Well, Singh challenged me to fight. This old man started it. Tomya, why did they fight? They are fighting to get you, Nual. Again? Do you think I'm a pig or a dog? So you can just fight to get me. Anyone who wants to marry me must make me fall in love. Don't fight each other like dogs. Oh, Nual. Wait up. Alright. I propose a new way. What is it? Tong-on? You two take turn courting her. Each has the time until the coconut shell sinks down. What do you say? Alright. Courting a lady is one of my expertise. I don't do it well, but I won't give up. Alright. Good. Then it's a deal. You can go home now. Meet again tomorrow. If you become my wife, you won't have to work this hard. Filthy mouth. Hey, the sword. Quickly. Don't ever show your face again. I have never met a girl as fierce as a tiger like this. You still have some time. Enough for another try. Do you think so? Yes. Alright. Let's do it. - Go. Tong-on. - Go. Let's go, Tid Dua. Why do you come back? Nual. Whatever jewelry you desire I will give them to you. You just have to be my wife. Hmm... this. Go away. Go! There's still some time left. Who knocked on the wood? Knocking on my head, Tong-on. How is it, Tid Dua? Look. Is there any cut? No. Since I was born, I have never been hit in the head. All the women in this land want to be my concubine. What makes her think she's so special? Don't forget that you are Tid Dua now. Just a commoner. I love my mother as my heart. She raised me up since my father died when I was only nine. I have known that. But I'm not a registrar to keep anyone's birth records. I just want to say that you are beautiful. Strong and diligent just like my mother. You might have heard an old saying that a man often falls in love with a woman who is similar to his mother. But I don't want to be anyone's mother. Otherwise. Then you can be my wife. Singh. Tong-on. Wake Up. Tong-on. Tong-on! A ghost? Where's the ghost? Not a ghost. It's me, Tid Dua. Let's go to Nual's house. It's not even dawn yet. I would be pleased just to see the roof. As you like it, Tid Dua. - I'm sleepy. - Tong-on. I've never felt this way with any lady. Go. I'm sleepy. Ok. As you wish. You sleep here alone. I'll just go by myself. Wait. Wait. Tid Dua. I'll go with you. I don't like to sleep alone. Alright. Follow me then. Wait. Wait. That way is the cemetery, Tid Dua. I want to go that way. Let's go another way. That way is longer. This is a shortcut. Go, quickly. Let's go. Tid Dua. Tid Dua. Quickly, Tong-on. Tid Dua. Tid Dua. Wait. Over there. Dogs howling. You sleep with the howling dogs. I'll go alone. Tid Dua, wait. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost! Tong-on. Thank you for rescuing me. I owe you my life. Anyone would help. This is not fair. Just go back and get some rest. I don't think they will dare coming back. It's so late at night. I'm not going back to sleep. Let's find a place to drink. Singh, do you know any place that we can get some drinks? Old man Aum's place only. Go. Take me there. Follow me. Tong-on. Tong-on! You sleep here alone. I'm going. Old man Aum. Give us some drinks. - Can stand it. - Thank you. Hey. Tid Dua. Thank you. Singh, where are you from? I'm just a rower for Lord Pichai. Why are you so skilled in boxing? The Lord put us in boxing camp. He hired a boxing coach from Singhburi to train us. Which boxing school is he from? From Venerable Thammachot, Pho Kow Ton Temple. Bangrajan people. You know Pho Kow Ton Temple? He must I not know it? I'm a former boxer. Right. He is a former boxer. He must know it. He sent Nark the Iron Shin to the ground. And fought me until I almost had to crawl back home. Singh, but your fighting skill is so good that the thieves had to run away. You saved my life. I told you. Don't mention it. Whenever I see someone in trouble, I can't stand not to help. Singh, I love your courage. You are a rare breed. Come on, Singh. Let's vow to be blood brothers. Your turn now, Singh. You mad men. Wipe it. Thank you. Thank you, old man Aum. From now on, you and I are blood brothers. Lord Pijit. This is dawn already. His Majesty hasn't returned. We should go out and look for them. I'm worried too. But if we went in to interrupt while His Majesty was enjoying we would be in trouble. But it's a good idea. Let's go to find them. Do you think the villagers are staring at us? Probably because of our clothes. What's wrong with our clothes? It wouldn't be strange in Ayutthaya. But the villagers here are not accustomed to it. What do you think we should do? Ouch. My head is... My head is breaking. After several types of alcohol, it would be strange not to get a headache. I have a hangover too. Tid Dua is used to Western type of whiskey. Not local ones. How is it better? It's served in the palace. How could Tid Dua drink in the palace? Is he the King so that he could drink in the palace? I also wonder if I'm the King. If a good man like Tid Dua is the King, I will give my life to serve him. Do you also have a hangover, so you think you're the King? So what? Hey. Some more. I can't. My head is breaking also. Singh. If you are my friend, you must drink with me. I can't drink any more. I can't. Hey, Singh. Disobeying the King means capital punishment. Enough. Enough. If you still think you're the King, I'll go home. Singh, I order you not to go. Hey, Tid Dua. I can accept being drunk. But I can't accept being addicted to power. Being drunk, you'll get sober in the morning. Being addicted to power, you won't realize it to the day you die. Lord Pijit. Is that Your Majesty? Do you still think you are the King? You want to punish me. What if you really were the King? Wouldn't you chop me up and feed the dogs? Impossible. I am the King. The King? Get this. I offer this to His Majesty. Don't. Lord Pijit. Let him go. Let him go. A soldier can accept the truth. But this time the truth is a little hard. Come here. Get me up. Have you seen the buffalo? The little one? I've look for him all morning but couldn't find him. Tui. Tui. Just enjoy this meal. I'll pay for it. Hey, beautiful lady. Where are you going? I'm looking for my buffalo. Have you seen it? I saw one. But I'm not sure if it's yours. Where did you see it? Over there. Let me go. You want it rough, huh? Singh. Go. That way. Quickly. Nual. Don't let them capture me for torture. You want me to... Yes. Stab me. And you... You... I can't do that. You must do it to me. I... I... Singh. Singh. Singh. Don't die. Singh. It's that way. May the gods in heaven help us. Please don't let Singh die this time. Follow me. Quick. Singh. Where're the royal guards? They're all gone. They didn't come into this temple. It must because... of the Holy Buddha. Singh. Take a rest. Use my lap as a pillow. That might not be proper. I don't want to take advantage. I love you with all my heart. I can even die for you. Letting you use my lap as a pillow is not a problem. What did you say? I said. I love you. Oh, my heart. I have loved you for a long time. But I didn't quite know my heart. Until... Until what? Until I was about to get killed by the royal guards. At that moment, I didn't care for my life. But I was worried about you. I only thought about you. I never thought I could be hugely indebted to the royal guards. Had they not try to rape and kill me, I wouldn't have known my heart that I love you. Singh. Unlike me. I have known my heart for a long time that I love you. From now on, you may rest assured that I will only have you in my heart. And will love you forever. Lord Rachasongkram is not someone who can be trusted. "Ayutthaya, B.E.2237" Even though he is a senior official since King Prasart Thong. And served under King Narai. But don't forget that he was a friend of that Greek Phaulkon. For personal interest, he betrayed his old friend. A person like this only thinks about himself. He has a deep thirst for power. Cannot be trusted. I might have to return to Viset Chaicharn again to see out what's real and what's fake with my own eyes. No sign of the tax collectors. No sign of the tax collectors. "Pho Thong Village" No sign of the tax collectors. Are you sure they are coming to Pho Thong? Yes. Lord Rachasongkram has informed me that they will be coming to this district. Then why haven't they arrived. Not even a shadow. Hey. Spread out to round up the villagers. Take everyone to the ground in front of the temple. Don't forget to take their properties. Go! Let me go. Nual. Nual. Nark. Nark. Nark. You are lucky today. We are not here to collect tax. But we have been ordered by His Majesty King Sua, to take young girls into the capital. It is the royal command. No one can disobey. His Majesty wishes to make you his royal concubines. Separate the good looking ones from the other. Go. You. No good. The one in the back too. Let me see. You. Please. Go. Get her. Go. You! Nark. Nark. Nark. Nark. Nark. Nark. Nark. You see? This is the punishment for disobedience. Go! Nark. Let me go. Nark. Something's happened. What is it? The royal guards. They came here and took all the girls. They said it was King Sua's command. Who did they take? Pim, Mali, Nual. Nual too? Nark the Iron Shin tried to resist. So he got killed. Sir, we have to rescue the women. We must do something. Or else, the women will all be raped. We will sneak into their camp. I know how to get inside. How will you get in? Through the pier. No walls at the pier. They use the river as the shield. We will sneak cross the river into their camp. What's your name? Nual Nual sir. Gorgeous. I can't believe that rural place like this will have gorgeous girl like you. What will King Sua bring us for? Guess, what will he take you for? You all need to know that this is royal command! When you reach the palace, You need to show your willingness to give yourself. The more you show up, the more he will fond of. Any disobedience, Die! Take them away. Come with me. Kamhang, take this woman into my tent. Yes, sir. Hey. Come now. Go! Go! Come with me. Where are we going? You will know soon. Let me go. Let me go. Can't you understand me? You want to get hurt? Don't! Nual. Don't you understand? Come here. Nual. Soldier. Soldier. Come here. Let me go. Take this wild cat away and chain her up. Starve her until it's time to take her to King Sua. Go. Chain her up and lock her inside the dock. Let me go. Don't resist. Let me go. Help me! I and Plod will go to rescue Nual. You. Kong and Tomya, you go to help the girls in the prison. Meet at the dock after you've resuced the girls. We will steal the boat from Lord Rachasongkram. I'll steal the boat. Nual. Nual. Nual. Nual. Singh. You've come to help me. How could I just leave you? Hurry up. They are coming. Quickly. Quickly. I will die with you, Singh. Singh. Singh. Carefully. Singh, watch out. Singh. Nual. Not yet. Not yet, Singh. They are coming to kill us. Tubtim. They were going to rape Tubtim. We have to help Tubtim. We need to hurry up. They are coming to kill us. Tomya. Come on. Where's Singh? He went to help Nual. Haven't seen him back since. Let me go. Tubtim. Singh. Singh. You've come to help me. - Sir. - What is it? The prisoners are escaping. The prisoners? Yes, sir. Capture them. Don't let them get away. They are getting away in the boat, sir. - Hurry up. This way. - Where's Plod. Plod got killed by the soldier. Plod. Capture them. Don't let them get away. Get in the boat. Go. Who's firing the gun in the river over there? - Rachamangsan. - Your Majesty. Take the Destroyer boat to investigate. Quick. All three boats, stop immediately. Don't stop. We can almost catch them. Follow them. Hurry up. All three boats, stop immediately. This is His Majesty's command. Don't stop. Follow them. Fire one over them. If they still don't stop. Fire at the middle of the boat. Fire. Stop. What is all the matter? Why did Lord Rachasongkram's men follow these people? Your Majesty. Lord Rachasongkram's men tried to capture a man named Singh. He broke into the camp and took a girl named Nual. The girl whom Lord Rachasongkram intends to offer Your Majesty. According to the law, it is death penalty, Your Majesty. Release Lord Rachasongkram's people. Go. Go. Go. Go. Father. Tubtim. How is it, my daughter? Tubtim. Is that Lord Pichai? Yes, Your Majesty. Why did you let your villagers offend Lord Rachasongkram? Aren't you aware that Lord Rachasongkram follows my order? I know full well, Your Majesty. - But... - But what? Singh and Nual are husband and wife. When Lord Rachasongkram took away his wife, Singh must try to bring her back, Your Majesty. Even if it is against the law. And the punishment is death? You can chop off my head. - But if anyone dares to hurt Nual, I can't stand it. - Singh. Shut up, Singh. Keep your head down. Don't look at His Majesty. May His Majesty have mercy with Singh and Nual. Please, Your Majesty. They broke the law. The punishment is clear. I broke the law because I refused to be your wife? Not at all. But Singh and his men sneaked into the camp and killed several of my men. I must investigate about this matter. But for now, take Singh and Nual away. Chain them up and lock them inside your residence. Tomorrow, bring Nual onto the boat with me. For Singh, I shall give him a sentence later. Yes, Your Majesty. Maen, take Tubtim to her room. I'll be back. Kong. Chain your friend to that pole. Yes, sir. I'm really sorry that I have arrest you two per King Sua's order. Can you not chain Nual? I have to chain both of you, as it's His Majesty's order. I'd like to beg you one more time. She is all bruised up. She can't possibly escape anywhere. Alright. I will not chain Nual. But if His Majesty knew about this I would get the same punishment as yours. I will not forget your mercy. Tomorrow, I will be taken from you. Tonight, let me lie down on your chest. Let me be your wife tonight. Nual. Now you have been chosen as a royal concubine of King Sua per his command. If I touch your body, you will be tainted. If things got to the King's ears, you will be punished. If I ever touch you you will be guilty. I do everything for you. Even if it is against my heart. I only want you to be safe from harm. I will accept it. Remember, from now on, you are not the same person. You are the King's concubine. No. His Majesty will travel back to Ayutthaya. He ordered me to take Nual. Isn't it tomorrow? His Majesty wants her to go tonight. Nual. You'll have to go with me. Where are you taking me? Lord Rachasongkram offers you to be the King's concubine. I won't go. You cannot refuese. This is the King's order. But you have to go. You know? Disobedience means death. I am willing to die. It's not only you. But your father will also be punished. You must go. Singh. Have you lost your love in me? If there's anything that I love more than you, it's the love for your safety. You must go, Nual. I will go. But I will not be King Sua's wife. Hey, Lord Pichai. Why did you let me wait? What do you want, Kamhang? This King's decree is for Lord Rachasongkram to bring the criminal named Singh to receive punishment in Ayutthaya. Are you going to take him at this moment? At this moment. Kong, bring Singh to Kamhang at this moment. Yes, sir. Beautiful. His Majesty will be pleased. Right, Chim. Puek, come to help me. Keep. I will bring you to see King Sua. You will become a royal concubine. Go. His Majesty ordered me to bring in the prisoner. You won't let me bring the prisoner to His Majesty? Your duty is done. From now on, it's my responsibility. You can take a rest. Wait to be called for reward for bringing in the criminal. Go. What are you waiting for? His Majesty is waiting for you over there. Go. Go ahead. Quickly. Go. Go in. Go in. Well, what? How? His Majesty allows you to get into the inner part of the palace. Isn't the inner part is prohibited for any men to enter? His Majesty allows you to enter the inner part of the palace. Uh. Maybe my head was already chopped off and this is heaven. You are not dead, and this is not heaven. This is the inner part of the palace. No man is allowed to enter this area, unless His Majesty gives permission. But... But where is His Majesty? I can only see angels. He is coming out soon. Go crouch in front of the throne. His Majesty the King. Keep your head down. Don't look. Singh, lift your head up to look at me. Do you remember me? You used to punch me until I couldn't open one of my eyes. But your punch... has made me see clearer after having been blind for a long time. Do tell me, who have been using my name to collect tax unfairly from the villagers. Singh. Even though you won't speak, I know. I have known it for quite some time. They are Lord Rachasongkram and his men. Kamhang and Samdang. You know? The reason why I went fishing at Viset Chaicharn was to find out the truth about who has been using my name to oppress people. And I saw it with my own eyes. But you almost got assassinated by the traitors. Fortunately you were there to help me. What you have done for me, I have to pay you back in full. I don't want anything in return. I did it just to protect Tid Dua, my blood brother. That's the important reason why I need to reward you. But... what kind of reward, Tong-on? A royal wife should be deserving, Your Majesty. Right. Very deserving. Hey, Singh. You can take anyone you like. How about this one? She is the prettiest in the land. Or maybe this one. She is such fine looking. Very deserving of you. Or how about this one? The one who led you in here. I don't want any royal wife, Your Majesty. They are not pretty enough? These are the most beautiful ladies in this land. You can't find anyone more beautiful. I don't want any woman, Your Majesty. I believe there is another lady whom Singh cannot refuse, Your Majesty. There is no woman in this kingdom that I desire. There is one that he will be pleased. Follow me. Singh, follow Tong-on. Go. But, about the people who committed crimes on your behalf... Your Majesty? Oh, that can wait. Now you go to take a look at your royal wife. If you still don't like her, then I can find you another one. Go. Come. - Go. - Yes, Your Majesty. Go. Follow Tong-on. Come. Quickly. You cannot refuse. It would be a royal insult. Death penalty. But I don't want. Wait until you see your royal wife. You might forget Nual. I will never forget Nual. Wait and see. Here. Your royal wife is waiting for you up there. Get in. I don't want any woman. I only want Nual as my wife. Wait. Wait. Get in. Go to see the face of your royal wife. She's a beauty. Believe me. I said I won't go. Believe me, Singh. Such a beauty. You will forget Nual. Believe me. Go up the stairs. Up the stairs. Go on, Singh. Go. Is this the royal wife? Oh, go away, Chim. Ugh. You destroyed the moment. Singh. Nual. Singh. Pantai Norasingh. Pantai Norasingh. Pantai Norasingh. Singh, come quickly. Sit down. Sit. Nual. Sit down. Nual. Do it. Like this. Who is Pantai Norasingh? It is you, sir. His Majesty has appointed you the title of Pantai Norasingh. With possession of a thousand fields. I am Pantai Norasingh? Yes, sir. And His Majesty wishes to see you now. So here's my steersman. You must have been fully rested. Well, the royal wife? It is your great mercy, Your Majesty. What did you say the people call me? Leprous dog, Your Majesty. Leprous dog, right? The people think that it's Your Majesty's order to collect tax. Do you think it's me who did it? If it's Tid Dua, absolutely not, Your Majesty. What if it's King Sua? Do you think it's Lord Rachasongkram who is behind this treacherous plot? I don't have any proof to incriminate Lord Rachasongkram. But you believe it's him. Lord Rachasongkram hates King Sua as much as other people. Is that so? Lord Rachasongkram has served six kings. Since King Prasartthong until my reign. He is one of the most trusted. So it is hard to guess as to why Lord Rachasongkram has been using my name. So that the people hate, Your Majesty. - Hate me? - Yes, Your Majesty. For what? I do believe that Lord Rachasongkram is ambitious. He must have had a treacherous plot. Hard to believe. Lord Rachasongkram is someone I trust the most. The most trusted, Your Majesty, is the most suspicious person. Rachamangsan, Yes, Your Majesty. Arrest Kamhang and force him to confess. Yes, Your Majesty. Tell me, what is the rebel's plan of Lord Rachasongkram? I don't know. With my honor. I really don't know the plan. My Lord. My Lord. My Lord. My Lord. What is it? Kamhang has been executed. He seemed to have been tortured before death. Then he must have exposed our plot. King Sua commanded Lord Pijit to prepare the army. Then the royal army will arrive here soon. - You. - Yes, sir. Prepare the boat the the rowers now. We will move out this evening. Where are we going? Burmese border. Many people in that area don't like King Sua. Once we get there, we will be safe. Which route will we use as an escape route? The Three Thousand Crocodiles route. Up the Chaiyo river. We have to use small boats because of the rough torrent. Full of rocks in the river. So King Sua must not dare to follow. Because the royal boats will not be able to pass. That's why I choose this route. King Sua will be at the end of his wits to follow me. We will be able to reach our destination. Stop Here. Pantai Norasingh. I think it is this location that Lord Rachasongkram stayed last night. The ashes are still fresh. They must have just moved out. Hurry up. We are almost at the border. Hurry up. Lord Pijit. It's the nature of an old man. You'll know it when you're old. Let me help carry you. Thank you. Enemy is coming! This is it. This is the Burmese village. Then we are out of King Sua's reach. Not so fast, Lord Rachasongkram. Do you really want to fight me? If you don't let me go, we'll have to fight. If this is your wish, then it is up to you. You are not going to bring back to Ayutthaya. You see, I got help from my friends. I'm the Lord of Ayutthaya. This is an internal affair. Ava has nothing to do with it. If you should decide to help Lord Rachasongkram, we will not be able to avoid the war. Help me. Help me from this tyrant. I have consulted with my brother. He doesn't agree with helping you. Why? Why not? Because Ava is not ready to confront Siam. If you help me, when I've become the King I will repay you in full. But now King Sua is the Lord of Ayutthaya. He is a friend to Ava. I give up. I give up, Your Majesty. Even though you don't die here, you are going to be executed anyway. Sanpetch Palace Lord Pijit, think more carefully next time. Hey, Singh. I've put down the resistance, and the kingdom is peaceful. I wish to go fishing again. Where do you want to go fishing, Your Majesty? Sakornburi. What do you think? Are you going through Kok Kham canal, Your Majesty? Right. It must be Kok Kham canal. Kok Kham Canal has thirty two sharp curves. It will not be convenient for you. It is better to go via Tha Chin river, Your Majesty. You don't know anything. I want to fish where there are a lot of carps. It's Kok Kham canal, not Tha Chin river. But... But it would be good if you can move the carps from Kok Kham canal into Tha Chin river. The river of Kok Kham canal is quite rough, because the canal is narrow. Too many sharp curves. It might be dangerous. Pantai Norasingh might make a mistake and let the boat hit the bank. Listen, Singh have steered the Ekachai boat through Chaiyok river. It's impossible that he will allow the Ekachai boat to hit the bank. Kong. Tomya. What are you doing here? Come up to my residence. Singh, wait. I don't want people to notice us. This is my residence. No one will bother us. There're only Nual and the servants. It's the servants that I don't trust. You seem strange today. What do you have in mind? Lord Pichai told us to bring you to him. He can come to visit me himself. So I can give him a city tour. But he wanted you to go see him yourself. He doesn't want anyone to see him in Ayutthaya. Strange. He wants me to see him in Viset Chaicharn? At Plub Temple cemetery. At Plub Temple cemetery? - Let's go. - Wait? At this time? Yes. This time. Singh. I want to know. When is King Sua going to travel by water again? I'm afraid I can't let you know. It is strictly confidential. I know. You will take Ekachai boat to travel via Sakornburi. How do you know that His Majesty will travel to Sakornburi? I have an informant in the palace. Who is it, sir? It is me, Pantai Norasingh. I am looking for a good person to bring King Sua down. We cannot let him reign any longer. That person is... Lord Pichai. Singh. Singh. You must take the Ekachai boat via Kok Kham canal. I will lie in wait at the Three Iron Woods, beside the pier at the temple. I will block the canal with the iron wood. Singh. You will help me kill King Sua. I beg you to reconsider this matter very carefully. I don't believe that His Majesty is a tyrant as people say. He is much more vicious than you think. He blamed everything on my father. So my father died because of his evil deeds. How dare you to betray your own husband? How about you, Singh? Do you dare to betray me, huh? You go back to think about it. Tomorrow night at three o'clock. I will be waiting your answer here. Singh. You should go to bed. What is the matter? Tell me. Singh, do you have anything in mind? Why don't you tell me? You never had any secrets with me. Why don't you tell me this time? Don't cry my love. I will tell you everything I have in mind. Lord Pichai called for me to meet him and asked me to assassinate His Majesty. Oh, my. He asked you to be a rebel. The punishment of rebels is death and forfeiture of property. You don't have to help him. I am indebted to him as my own father. I cannot betray him. If I inform His Majesty about this assassination plot... If you do inform His Majesty, it will not only be Lord Pichai, but all of my old friends will be executed. Why didn't you tell Lord Pichai? He didn't listen to me. He thought I defended King Sua because His Majesty took me in and gave me the title and property. He thought I got stuck with the title and comfortable life I am having. But he might listen to me. Let me talk to him one more time. According to the law, high-ranking officials and wives cannot see each other alone. I will sneak out of here alone. I'm going now. I should reach his residence before dawn. If he agrees with me, I will come out for you to see at the pier. If I see you, I can be certain that the assassination plot is cancelled. But what if I don't see you? Then it means Lord Pichai doesn't change his mind to kill His Majesty. You must make a decision by yourself, what you should do. I believe whatever decision you make will be proper. I really do believe that. Kong. Tomya, and Master Reng and you go to hide at the next curve. Then fell an iron wood to block the royal boat. And hide yourself well, You can't let any of the rowers see you. What do you want me to do, sir? You will bring your villagers to wait at the sugar palm tree and watch out for the royal guards who will protect the royal boat. Yes, sir. Go. Quickly. Hurry up. We're almost there. Row harder. Come on. Lord Pichai. Lord Pichai. Lord Pichai. Lord Pichai. Oh, Nual. Is Lord Pichai here? He is not here. He has gone out since last night. Where has he gone? I heard that he went to Sakornburi. Sakornburi. Where exactly in Sakornburi? I don't know that. Oh, Nual. Won't you eat something first? No, thank you. Nual. Nual. Nual, wait for me. I know where my father plans to meet King Sua. Where? Takien Temple. He plans to assassinate King Sua there. Thank you, Tubtim. I need to go now. Nual, I'll go with you. I will talk to my father. To change his mind about assassinating King Sua? Yes. But not because I don't agree with my father. Then why? Because he will kill Singh. Don't misunderstand. I don't love Singh like before. But Singh used to save my life. So I have to pay him back. Not because I still have feelings for him. Don't worry about this matter. If you want to go, we must go now. Or we won't be in time. We need to go now. Next time it will be my turn. I will sneak out of here alone. I'm going now. I should reach his residence before dawn. If he agrees with me, I will come out for you to see at the pier. If I see you, I can be certain that the assassination plot is cancelled. But what if I don't see you? Then it means Lord Pichai doesn't change his mind to kill His Majesty. You must make a decision by yourself, what you should do. Hurr... Which way? Let me go. Sit Down! What are you three doing here for? To stop my father and you from committing treason. I am doing this for the sake of the country. King Sua is not a tyrant as you think. The more you speak, the more I see that you are like your husband. He is infatuated with power, wealth and comfort. So now he has lost the courage to risk his life because he fears getting his head chopped off if he fails. One more curve and the royal boat will arrive at the temple. Tell Lord Pichai to be ready. Yes, sir. Please. I beg you. Please change your mind about the assassination. If not, I will inform His Majesty. Let me go. Ahh... Chim. Chim. Chim. Go to Takien Temple. How about these two? Tie them up. Don't let them near the canal. Yes, sir. Go. Let me go. Chim. Singh. Nual, Turn your back. Mali, what are you doing here? Lord Pichai has a present for you. What is it, pretty girl? You want to know? Mali. Mali. Nual, untie me. Hurry up. Thank you so much. We are old friends. I have to help you. I will hurry to warn Singh. I will go to warn my father. I will try to convince my father to abort the assassination plot. We need to go now. What is going on? Steersman. Stop at the bank. I said, stop at the bank. All rowers. Speed up to level three. Speed up. Listen to the steersman. Don't slow down. Quickly. Speed up to level three. Row. Don't stop. Row on level three. Speed up. Don't stop. The prow. Stop immediately. I have an absolute necessity that we can't stop here, sir. Row. Row. Speed up. There's someone riding this way. Tubtim. Tubtim. Tubtim. Why in the world did you do this, Singh? According to the law, any steersman who breaks the boat's prow must receive death penalty and forfeiture of property. Hey, you can see that this canal is full of sharp curves. Singh told me not to go via Kok Kham but I forced him to come this way. Your Majesty, please let me receive the punishment as stated in the law. What did you say, Singh? You want me to chop off your head? Yes, Your Majesty. What an odd request. There are only people who asked for my forgiveness, but you asked me to punish you. Your Majesty, According to the law, regardless of intention, the punishment is always death and forfeiture of property. Shut up! I won't kill someone I love. Your Majesty, the law doesn't give any exception to the ones you love. Singh, let me ask you. Who makes rules and write the laws? The King, correct? Because the King determines the laws, why can't I who is the King cancel or make exceptions to the laws? Maybe you can, but the people will say that Your Majesty is unfair. That Your Majesty doesn't keep the sanctity of the laws. The people will lose respect to the law, which could lead to corruption and treason, Your Majesty. Singh. I cannot comprehend. I don't want to kill you. But you gave me reasons to force me to kill you. Let me be alone with Singh. Singh. I'll order them to make a dummy. And the executioner will chop off the dummy's head. If you do that, the people will use this an excuse in the future. I would like to tell you the truth. But I will have to ask one thing in favor. I can give you any promise you want, Singh. But not a promise to kill you. I broke the prow on purpose so the boat can go through. Because at Takien Temple, the next curve, there are people who plan to assassinate Your Majesty. Who? Please give me a promise, you will not punish that person and his men. Someone is trying to kill me, but you asked me not to kill him. Then you'd better not tell me his name. So I will not hold a grudge against him later. He is a good man, and will give you great support in the future. He has misunderstood Your Majesty. But he will understand it and give full allegiance after my head was cut. Singh. Singh. I don't understand. I don't understand. Why does it have to be this way? Your Majesty will understand later on. Singh. I will not kill you no matter what. I will not kill you. You are my only blood brother. I'd rather fight the rebels. No, Your Majesty. Even if Your Majesty can quell the rebels this time. There might be another rebellion. Your Majesty needs to make the law sacred. This is the only way to make the nation peaceful. If you don't order my execution, it means I will have to live with shame forever. Your Majesty, don't let me live as a man without honour. Singh. Your Majesty, I ask for a chance for the execution of this steersman. For he is willing to sacrifice his life for the King the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, and the Land of Siam. To be remembered among later generations. It is thus not proper to be done by a common executioner. Only me, Rachamangsan the naval commander who deserves to execute this steersman, Your Majesty. Singh, if you die. I will follow you. Singh! Nual. Nual, my love. Don't be sad. Even if my life is no more. I cannot hold you as I used to. But my soul will always be with you. I will always protect you and my child. Please know that I loved you more than myself. Keep yourself from harm. And raise our child up well. Tell him that his father was a steersman. A steersman who loved his mother with all his heart. Don't be sad. Don't be sad. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh. English Subtitles by Warat Karuchit
