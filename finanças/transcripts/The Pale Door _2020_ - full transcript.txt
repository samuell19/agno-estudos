Hey, little brother. Hey, big brother. Are you scared? Well, if you ever get scared, just remember I'll always be right here. I have an idea. Come here. Put this on. As long as you have this on, you'll be safe because I'll be with you. It's like big brother magic. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. We're here. Come on. That's it. Here. Now, you boys remember what I taught you. Make sure you look after your brother. Yes, sir. Put your boots on. You wait for my signal. Okay? Go. Mom? Duncan! Jacob. I love you. Come on. Come on. Stay. Hey, when I say go, you run. You don't look up. - You don't stop running. - No! It's just like Pa taught us, okay? Hmm, no. Okay. Now. I thought they got you. I know. Time to go. Boys! - Now. - Come on. Come on here. Come on. Mama! - Mama! - No, no, no, no. - Mom! - We can't do this. Ah, damn it! Apologies. I... You got a death wish, boy? Because it's about to come true. Sorry, sir. It was an accident. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come... Come on now, Earl. He don't want no trouble. Earl. Are you trying to tell me this little pissant is a Dalton? He don't look like no Dalton. How about you tell me what you think a Dalton looks like then? Hey, friend, now, we're just funning, just having a little playing with the kid. That's all. Hmm. If you want to keep playing, we can keep playing. All good here. Come on. You boys have yourselves a daisy of a day. Hey, little brother. Hey, big brother. You all right? Of course you are. I haven't seen you in a while. Hmm? Well, me and the gang have been having some fun. You know, why don't you come have a drink with us? I... I got a job to finish. Well, I'm sure that can wait, can't it? I think, in fact, it's break time. - Aw. - Come on. Maybe, but what about... No. You're right. You're right. I baked some more of that fry bread y'all like, a little going-away treat. What, are you leaving already? Well, some folks aren't too happy with the fun that we've been having, so me and the gang, we're going to lay low for a while. Hey. Come on. I always come back. Sit down! Come on. Have a drink. Sit next to the big man. He just got a fresh bear kill. With his, uh, bare hands. I'm okay. I'll just stand. New posters? Sheriff Russell brought them in last month, upped the bounty. Well, about to go up again. Aw, $1,000? Come... Will you please tell those fine men at the printing press that my head is worth at least, um, well, at least double that? Don't worry. You'll catch up. Shit. Oh! I did not spill a drop! How much you squirreling away, stud? Oh, I... I mean, I got a little money, but I'm not, uh... Girl will deal you in. I can't. I'm... I'm saving it. I'll play his hand. Saving up for the family farm, huh? The past is the past. Let's leave it that way. You got to work here for, what, 10 years, save up enough to buy that little place? 8 years, 11 months, 7 days. Damn, down to the day. You should really see it. I mean, they fixed it all up. It... It looks just like when we were kids. You been going back out there? Duncan, it's Buck. God damn it, Buck, you get out of that street and stop playing with this man! Not today, Wylie. Draw! I got him! I got that son of a bitch! I thought they told you to stop messing with that bounty man. That they did. You going to listen next time? Next time. I'm calling his Peacemaker. Well, shit. It's either me or the undertaker. Rest in peace, brother. I'll see you there soon. Damn you, Buck. Now we're one short for tomorrow. Yeah, I know. We may have to call it off. Why not get one of them Burns boys? Oh, I don't know about that. They're stone-cold killers. Eh, that's not the best idea. Brenda, you didn't. Oh, I certainly did, both of them at the same time. Nevertheless, why does that disqualify them from this then? Oh, it doesn't for me personally. I mean, double the trouble is double my pleasure. I'm just simply answering your question is all, but do bear in mind that after that, robbed them both blind. I'll do it. You'll do what? I'll help. - That could work. - The hell it could. You seen them pelts in there. I shot those. I'm getting damn good, too. Yeah, you are, and you're earning yourself an honest living. There's no reason to leave that. Well, you don't get to tell me what to do anymore. You sure about that, boy? Look, Duncan, I... Man, I... I appreciate everything you've done for me. You know I do. But I'm ready to do more. You know, and maybe my cut will be enough to buy back Dad's farm. Forget about Vernon. Forget about that damn farm. Stop calling him Vernon. He was your daddy, too. Hey. Let me do this. Lester. They'll figure it out. Hey. Hey. What do y'all think? Huh? You look like shit. Son of a... Hear me out. We both know we got a good team here. Mm-hmm. And this one promises to be a very big score. Well, then, we do it without him. Look, just a half-day past Cordoba Canyon, there's an impasse that they'll be crossing just before daylight, no one out that way for miles. Now, we make our positions down the tree line on the east and west banks, and we'll be in and out of there in flash. Hell, we've been down far more difficult roads before. Well, I ain't putting him in the middle of a firefight. And I ain't asking for that. Maybe we move Brenda to Buck's spot, crowd control. Then Jake steps in as horse wrangler, helps us beat a hasty retreat. He never even makes it past the tree line. And if things go south? Then it wasn't what the good Lord wanted, and we move on for the next. Have I ever been wrong? Yes, you have, several times. Well, you and me, we've been through some shit though, right? We have. And here we are, still kicking. - Mm-hmm. - So you trust me? Of course I trust you. It's never been about that. It's just, the kid is the only family I got, and I didn't have a choice. I get it. I do. But Jake, he's old enough to be making his own decisions. Just like his brother, he can be pretty damn stubborn. No. No. Stubborn or not, it's still my call. Thanks for proving my point. Howdy! The name's Brenda Bertie Younger, at your service. Y'all stay calm, y'all stay breathing. Hey, give mama a little drink, why don't you? Come on. Mm. More of a bourbon girl myself. Anybody got Thistle Dew? Oh, hi. Hey, mama. That's got to hurt. What the fuck is this? Where's the goddamn safe? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Just where you crawling off to? - You know. - I don't know. You're injured. That's an awful lot of Pinks for one goddamn box. Who you moving? Who the buyer? I don't know shit. You sure about that? Hmm? Call it a hunch, but I feel like you might know something. I know you are fucked. You should go. Just go! Go! Open. Wider. Ah! Ah! Now, last chance. You can go to hell! Ah! Thought you might say that. You're already there now. Ah! Jake, what the hell you doing out here? Let's go! Let's go! Let me do that. Well, who are you? My name is Pearl. Glad to know you, Pearl. Why'd they leave you shackled up like that? I'm afraid I don't know. Um, these men just took me from my home in Potemkin. Potemkin? What is it worth? Worth? I... I don't know, sir. I... I don't really know much of anything that's going on. Nobody knows nothing, got it. Wait. You got something to say? - We can't just... - Hey. Look, kid. People don't put people in boxes because they expect them to behave themself, okay? I don't know her story, and I don't give a shit. All we're going to do is move her from here to there, collect our money. Alright? Seriously? We're still doing this? She's just an innocent woman. Wylie, help me understand what's happening here. I don't know. There was some extra security on it, but to be frank, I expected a little more gold and a little less girl. - God damn. - Who's the buyer? I don't know him, uh, some middle man with a whole lot of money, I guess. Mather, Cotton Mather IV, way up down this way. Being real secretive about the whole thing. We can't do this. Alright? We ain't going to sell her to nobody. That ain't what we do. We're a bunch of fucking outlaws. What are you even talking about? You know what I mean, Dodd. Well, there goes our big payday. If you take me to my home, there would be a handsome reward. What the... You alright? Huh? You get hit? No. Oh, shit. Duncan! - Ah. Ah! - Jesus. I know. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. - I'm okay. - Duncan. I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh. She got me. Hey. Hey, can you hear me? - Okay. - Get me up. Help him up. Help him up. Help him up. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Ah! Jesus. I'm alright. Where's my hat? Where's my hat? Thanks, Lester. Ohhh. Alright. Get me to my horse. Get me to my horse. Come on. Alright. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. - Ah! - Oh, come on. Watch, he... Come on. Oh, God damn. - Okay. Okay. - God damn. Jesus. I got him. Got him. Wrap it tight. Come on. Make it tight! - Alright. That's good. - Okay. - Come on. - Alright. That ain't my first rodeo. - Oh, hell, no. - Come on. This way. Get! Get on it! Ohh. I got it. I got it. What can I do for you? You can go to your horse. - Go to your horse. - Okay. Come on. Come here, little brother. It's just a graze. She just grazed me. I know she did. Brother magic. Alright? Yeah. I'm going to be all right. I know. I got it. I got it, boy. We got to go. Come on. How long? Ah, shit. Macon is too far. Hey. You got any doctors in that town of yours? Yes. [Mid-tempo music playing Let's hold up here. Get him off his horse and rest it for a bit. Okay, lady. You heard the man. This is your stop. Her name is Pearl. See, kid? That's the problem. You name them, you start to get attached. - Which way to the doctor? - I can take you. No, that ain't going to be the way this works. Dodd's right. You point in the direction of the doc, we go get him. Truman, Chief, go check the town and get the doc. Hell, find anyone who can help. I'm going to take him back here. Hey. Hey, help is on the way, okay? I'm sorry, Duncan. It's all my fault. No, you don't understand. I... I saw her. She was right there, I saw her, and I... I know. You know? I know. I... I just... I couldn't. I couldn't pull the trigger. I'm glad you couldn't do it. I'm glad you couldn't do it. How's he doing? He lost a lot of blood. He wants to see you. Hell of a situation we got going here. Don't talk. Keep your energy. Wylie, y-you've always been... you've always been a good number two, and I trust you with my life. But until we get out of this, Lester is in charge. You hear me? And you... you do me a favor. You take care of my brother, okay? On my life. Mine too. Is this necessary? It's necessary. Oh, come on, man. Greenhorn here seems to forget that a bunch of armed Pinkertons found it necessary to shackle his new friend and lock her in a box. Maybe she didn't do nothing wrong. Or maybe this is all a trap, and I ain't about to let what happened to your brother happen in vain, you understand? Ain't nothing out there but more woods. Fuck this. So, what? So this building, this... this is your town? I offered to take you. She obviously can't be trusted. Keep an eye on her. I'm going to take a look around, God damn it. Where have you brought us? Brenda? Ride hard to this outpost and get a doctor or medical supplies or whatever, and get back here fast. The fuck, man?! You should be more careful. Y'all were close. You know, you could be nicer. How you mean like? In general? I think you know what I mean. Yeah. But I know that you know that this is all fucked. Yeah? Yeah. Say, man, you got another one of those? Yeah, sure. Hold on. For one of them little jerkies I know you got stashed somewhere. Oh, shit, man. Yeah, sure. Help yourself. Ooh. I knew it! I fucking knew it! Where is she? Where is the goddamn girl? What the hell? She was right there. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? He helped her. - What? - Now, look. We can all trust each other here. - Can we? - Uh-huh. Bullshit. I should just put a bullet right through your fucking head. I think you should back the fuck off. That's what I think you should do. Alright. I see you still playing the dead daddy role, now? Is that it? Mother is waiting for you. How did you get loose? Did you just say mother? Your friend is dying. - Do you want help or not? - Yes. The help is this way, to the brothel. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, now we're just going to follow her, now? She did say brothel. How much further? Not far. Town square is just ahead. This way. Nothing out here, huh, Truman? None of this was here, I swear. Are you enjoying your present? It's the best. Where are my manners? This is Duncan. He's been injured. On your daring rescue? Yes, ma'am, it was quite an ordeal. Help this man. Gentlemen, please, make yourselves at home. Let's get a bed ready for this nice man. Oh, and I understand there was a reward involved. Of course. A handsome sum for these handsome men. You boys enjoy yourselves while we take care of your friend. Oh, hey, um, good luck getting him to talk. Hey, little brother. Hey, big brother. They said they're going to take care of you. - Mm-hmm. - Fix you up good. Mm. Just in case things don't work out in the end. Don't say that, that's not... You keep it with you, okay? Brother magic ain't going to make me a better-looking corpse. Your seed is in another. It's a boy. Jacob. Are you okay? Yeah. I... I just... I heard a noise. Let's allow the boys to have their fun. Okay. Let me bathe you first, honey? Oh, no, baby. See, let me tell you something about myself. Dodd, he like it dirty. Pour you one? Uh, no, thank you, ma'am. Just one, take the edge off. All the men you came in with had but one thing on their minds. I... I guess I was just worried about my brother. I get the feeling it's more than that with you. I'm sorry, I-I don't mean to be rude, ma'am, but they... they're just not my type. Oh. I won't say anything. Have you ever been with a...? No. Don't see that around these parts much. So, outlaw brothers. This is just a one-time thing. This life not for you? I'm just out of place here. Couldn't even pull the trigger. You have never taken a life? No. One of life's true innocents. You're a sweet boy the way you take care of your brother. Well, he's always taken care of me. I think there's only two kinds of family... the one you're born into and the ones you find along the way. Yeah, Lester's like that for me. After my parents died, he's always looked after me. That's what my girls did for me. There was some bad men, and they tried to do me harm once. Mm. But these girls, they risked their lives for me. They took me into their family on the day that Pearl was born. May I ask what happened? Come with me. The most beautiful girl. Let go! What are you doing? Let go of me! Let go! Let... No! Let go of me! N... No! Do not be deceived. That there is a devil. Cotton, please, just let me have my baby, then you can take me. Please, Cotton. String her up. No! No! No! No, don't hurt my baby! Good people of Potemkin, I have traveled many miles from the town of Salem in search of this vile woman, who shall escape God's wrath no more. She who stands before you is among the last of a rotten breed. One of the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked creatures in the world. They which sin must go to their father the devil into everlasting burning. They which never pray, God will pour out His wrath upon them. And when they bed and pray in hellfire, God will not forgive them. For there they must lie forever. I ask the rest of you, are you willing to go to Hell and burn with the devil and his angels? As you and the abomination that lives inside you have been found guilty of witchcraft and must immediately be put to death. Your burning will continue in the lake of fire for all eternity. Don't be afraid, Jacob. And that was you? The day I was born. But... But you were burned? We all burned. It was the worst pain I've ever felt. And in just a few hours, it'll be exactly two centuries ago on this very day. Guys! Guys! Dodd! - Go away! - Dodd, get out here! Come on! I've given you enough pointers, do you understand? No, it's... I apologize for that, princess. Don't stop. I thought Dodd liked it dirty. What the fuck? Bitch! Bitch! Kid! Where the fuck you going? Come on, get up! Come on. Sure, right. Let's go! They have Duncan. Come on! You may kill the others, but bring the boy to me. Let's go! Let's go! What the fuck just happened? We got to get the fuck out of this town. Not by horseback we ain't. What about the others? They dead? Yes, they dead. Were you just coming from the same brothel as I was? You left us. Yeah, well, you know, the door was right there. But I just saved you now, so... They had the drop on us, and they just let us go. By all accounts we shouldn't even be alive. They killed plenty. And Duncan? They were helping him, and then all this shit happened, and then he was gone. It all happened so fast. I don't know. Doesn't make any sense. None of this shit makes any sense. Maria told me that she was burned to death the day Pearl was born 200 years ago today. You know, kid, if you had said that on any other given day, I just assume you been kicked in the head by a horse. I think they need me. The Lord protects the righteous, not the wicked. So, we have something they want and we can use that. He's not a poker chip, Dodd. No, but he's an advantage, and from where we stand, we could use more like that. What about Duncan? You said he was already gone. Gone. That doesn't mean he's dead. Let go. I don't know, son. We ain't got a lot of options. Alright? They got the jump on us before. Now we know what we up against, and we got the kid. Look, Jake, you know how much I loved your brother. No, stop. I'm not leaving without him. He made you promise, both of you, to protect me, right? That's exactly what we're doing. I'm going either way, so if you two want to keep that promise, maybe you best follow. Well, look at the kid, huh? Well, look, man, I mean, if we going to die in this anyway, I suppose we take some of them with us. So, we actually doing this? Ah, shit. Really? I tell you what, I got a special one for the birthday girl. Okay. So how do we get the fuck out of here? They're gone. This is just one big fucking game to them. I'm done figuring shit out. I got you. You are so beautiful. You all are. The woman at the stake, cut her down. The sacrifice is complete. Please, give her a proper burial. Jacob, the sweet boy that my daughter ensnared, he is special... uncorrupted, innocent blood. He alone can sustain us for decades. Oh. Come on. Keep moving. It's empty. Your first kill... a door. Stay close. What the...? Where the hell are we? I don't know. I was hoping you could tell me. Stepped in the door, and here I am. Yeah, well, I done had about just enough of this strange shit. Where are you going? That way. Hm. You know where this leads? Look here, Wylie. One way is just as good as the next out here, so I picks that way. Watch it, kid. I know. - Duncan? - Jesus, kid. You ever hear of the element of surprise? Sorry. Duncan, you here? What about surprise? Yeah, there's nobody here, kid. I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse. Where did Lester and Wylie go? Let's take a minute. It just goes on forever. Yeah. These stars, they're just a little off. I think I know now why Duncan put you in charge. Look, listen, I do the... No, no, I was bothered by it before, but now I get it. He did it because he thought he was dying. And I'm the closest thing that boy has got to a daddy. Now, I know y'all done been through some... some shit, but me and those boys, we go way back. Hold it. Come on. Let's keep walking. You boys need to learn how to announce yourself. Yeah, you didn't announce yourself neither, and where the hell did you go? We turned around, you gone. We tried to follow you, but whatever door we went through wasn't the same as yours. I take it you two didn't find Duncan either. It ain't nothing but a dust-covered ghost town, like we was never there. Now, I know that's not you boys out there. We're just a bunch of sitting ducks right here. They're fucking with us, boys. The church. What? We need to get to the church. Got it. This way. The church. Follow me. Going back to the church seems like a good idea. Follow me. Alright. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Oh, shit. What are you doing? They're out there. I don't think they can come in here. All we want is Jacob. In exchange, we will give you money, women, and safe passage. Why me? Your pure blood is the key. There's nowhere to go. Hey! Hey! Get fucked. You don't get the kid. You sure as fuck don't get me. What the fuck? Come on. Come on in. Come on. Hey. They're gone. Hey, maybe they got scared. Well, maybe not, but they gone. We've got to get the hell out of here. - We have a plan. - No, no. Sitting here forever ain't a plan. They can't get inside, so sacred ground, maybe. House of God. House of God? This is a coffin, boys. Alright? Now, they're going to be coming back in here, and when they do, they're going to be killing y'all because you all are the ones decided to live here. More like die here. Maybe they can't get in here, and maybe they can. All I know is, they're not in here right now, and that is just fine by me. They out there plotting something. I can feel it. And what do you think they're up to? Now, how the fuck should I know? They love you so much. You tell me. Hey. Hey. What? No. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Hey. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm so hungry. Hey. I'm so hungry. Dodd was right. I shouldn't be here. Your brother knew the risk. He wanted better for you. He didn't want you to live with that soldier's heart. I'm so sick of hearing that. There was something else going on. He'd never... never talk about it, but I know he blamed Pa for what happened. Yeah, he did. And he was right. What? There's a reason those people came there. Yeah. Yeah, for our money and our... our horses. - No. No. - And then you and Duncan went and got revenge for our family. No. That's just what we told you. They didn't take anything. Son, those people came for blood. Why? Why? Now, there's nobody can stop me from telling you this, but you is old enough now to hear the truth. What are you talking about, Lester? Your daddy never made a good rancher. Matter of fact, he was horrible at that shit. I was better than he was. I had more experience. I learned from my old owner. So I helped him out as much as I could, but he was the man that made me a free man, but I... I didn't always feel that way. I don't know what you're saying, Lester. They forced me to do things I didn't want to do. What? But, uh... Lord, for the first time in my life... I owned the shirt that was on my back. Everything you got, everything you had... we took it from somebody else. Stole. That property up there on in it, the ranch you grew up on, boy, we stole all of it. We grew that ranch to double in size. Yeah. Yeah. We did that. After we took it. And that ain't all we took. We took the cattle, and we took the money from every little rancher that was around you, as well. No. Duncan had no other choice. And truth be told, you would've been involved in all this shit, as well. Our stories had already been written. He never wanted you to walk in his footsteps. And he never ever wanted you to carry the kind of hate in your heart... that he carried in his. Jake! Jacob! Jake! You're not hurt? No. The women, they fixed me up. Hey, big brother. Hello, Jake. What's wrong? You're not Duncan. You're not my brother. Shit. Lester. No. Where are you going? Whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay, okay. I got you. I got you. Alright. Wylie, Wylie, get your ass over here. Alright. Just fight, okay? You're going to be alright, Lester. You're going to be fine. Please don't go. You're all I have left. Come on, please. Please. Jacob. Wylie. We've walked through the pale door, and hell was our reward. - Wylie. - What? No. Stop, Wylie! Listen to me, kid. It's been dark out way too long. The sun ain't coming up. We barely have enough ammo for one, let alone both. We are not safe here. I know. I don't know if it's any consolation to you. You know, you ain't the only one lost a brother. Maybe not by blood. Hell, I never had no fucking family. I was raised in a Goddamn brothel. And, uh... Duncan was my brother, too. You... You may think I don't give a shit. And I do. I had a role to play, and I played it. But you don't think for a second you're alone. Now, you and I, we're going to walk out and either find our way out of this labyrinth or go down swinging, okay? - I've only got one left. - Me, too. Do not let them take you. You understand? Save it for yourself. Whoa! She's crowning. Hey, kid. Stay there. Don't turn all yellow on me now. - Alright? - I... I guess. Stay with me. You listen. When we get out of this, I want you to promise me something. Become a farmer. As an outlaw, you're bad fucking luck. Let's go. We're walking that way. Go. Go. Don't turn back. I am done running. We had this date for a while. Come on. Come on, now. Let's go! I won't let you take me, too. We can offer you... What? Money? Women? Men? Your brother. He's alive? Yes. Bullshit. I don't believe you. - No! - Why do you even care? If you do that, your innocence will be gone. You'll have taken a life, and with that, your blood will be tainted. You'll just be another soiled soul. Then let me see my brother. Hey, big brother. Hey, big brother. What, you take me for a fool, huh? - That's not my... - Hey, little brother. Jake, Jake. Are you sure you're okay? Oh, my God. A little sore, but these ladies gave me something. What's going on here, Jake? - I-I need you to do something. - What is it, little brother? - It's not going to be easy. - What is it little brother? - What is it? - Forgive Father. Why do you say that? Buy back the farm. End the hate. Why? Why are you saying that? He loved you, too. He loved you, too. You finally get to make a choice. Do we have a deal? I want assurances he'll be safe, or I swear to God, I'll do it. Jake... What are you doing, Jake? No. Stop. Let me do this one thing, please. Let me be the one who protects you for a change. I'm your older brother. I know, and you've got to leave. You've got to leave. Go back to that... that pretty lady of yours. Make a family. Have the life that you couldn't, that Dad couldn't. Come on. You let him go. Our power ends at the town's edge. We control who can leave. Can I watch him leave? I love you, little brother. I love you, big brother. Hey, girls. Come on, now. Let's have us a little supper. Come on. Hey, little one. There you go. Are you coming in soon? I need to put little Jacob to bed. Soon.
