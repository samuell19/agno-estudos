Oh, dear, poor me... What will I do tonight? So what!? Do you want me to bring you a lover, or maybe the circus, huh? I've got the right to go out with my friends, once in awhile. Stupid woman! Yeah, just go on! Cry or sing, whatever. She's not what she's used to be. Sadly. I shouldn't do this any more. Eh, Marta, Marta... Yep. She's not what she's used to be. Miletisimus! Hey, scoundrels... Wait... What's this? If so few people come while I'm still alive, how much will be on my funeral? Don't worry, captain! You just sail away and we will bring people from the other island. Eh, my children, it is too big ship for our small harbor. Ahoy there! Even Satan runs off from sinners! - Carry me! - Home, captain? No, took me out of here at the trough. I want to drink water from there. "In my hat... ...there are all kind of goodies. "In my hat - you can find all you want... " "In my hat - you can find all you want... " "In my hat, there are all kind of goodies. "In my hat - you can find all you want...

Now we'll see... Do it for me, please go. It's useless, Father. I know Marta too well. - She doesn't want to see you! - That's impossible! I've told you hundreds times. She doesn't want even to hear of you. But she is mine... We were... together... for 15 years. That's why she ran away from you! Just imagine that she's gone. That's terrible. Forget about her. I can not. Don't cry, Father. - I'm sorry, as well. Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off, when I say! - We are travelling! - Who is traveling? - We! All of us! And you, captain. You, too. I've calculated. In relation to the Sun, our island has moved for 18 degrees! Gentlemen, our island is drifting! And who knows... And who knows where we can be... ...in a second or two? Here you are. I brought this for you. - Put it somewhere. - No, no, Madam, I brought it for you. - What is it? - It came with the sea. - Why are you bringing me that junk? I am a mother and a married woman. Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! Sweetheart, does someone bother you? - Just sleep, don't worry, my sweetheart. "I fall in love with a girl from my village. She's a bit timid... ...but so dear to my heart. ...but so dear to my heart. I'm gonna steal her... ...if they don't give it to me. " - If the captain is not going to die tonight, ...I'll have to pick up someone's soul. - Our captain has got a good wine. It would be a beautiful death. M- m-m... - Here you are, captain! - Remove that from my house! - But that is a part of your home, captain! - Remove that from my house! Remove it! I feel much better now. Much better. - Come on. - Come on, captain, it's time to try on. - The suite? - No, the coffin! Take it away, Andjelko.

You will be the most beautiful dead man in the world! No one has ever been burried in such a nice cloth. - Well? - Father! Open that chest. Give me that uniform! Something you're concerned about, captain? Just don't know what to do. In this, I got married and spent my youth, And I sailed through all seas in that uniform. It would be best if you died twice. Hear it? Someone calls on the sea. It is me who it calls. I'm the only one left. It follows me all my life. - Have you seen my Marta? - No. Me neither, I swear to God. There's the preacher... What's wrong women? A devil has arrived on the island, Father. - A devil? Yes, Father. She drank the water, here, while I was over there! She drinks water just fine, Father. And? When she spotted me, ...she run away over there! They say that she is beautiful, ...and the beauty is not evil. And don't mention the name of a devil unnecessarily! Enter. Enter freely. Uncover yourself. The ship has arrived?! I have dresses and gold. A lot of gold. And all olive groves are mine. And people. Look... This was me when I was young. Look. Come closer. Look.

I don't know, I haven't tried to open it yet. - Liar! - Leave that fool alone. Maybe there is treasure in it, and maybe there is not. Look! I'll find out what's inside! - It's mine! - Where is it? Who?.. What? Why do you had to get on the floor captain, when you have such soft bed? Andjelko, what they are doing? Who let them to do that? Let it go, Andjelko! And who are those girls that haunts you? What girls? Don't snoop around my house! It's easy for you to laugh, Andjelko. So, no one was here? What is wrong with you, are you insane? "...
