Hello? Anyone around? I'm kind of in a hurry. Money's on the pump. Nice talking to ya. Catch you later. Hello? Is anybody here? Who's there? I wanna speak to Alison, Alison Bernet. This is her mother. I'll wait. Alison, are you all right? I got scared. I had to call. I don't know. Just a feeling. Well of course I worry about my only daughter. You know us mothers. What cranky, fusspots we are. Are you eating three meals a day? Are they treating you like a human being? A little girl who's... I know, there I go again. Bad habit. You're fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm standing here dripping onto the rug. I just got out of the shower. The "Creature from the Black Lagoon" getting ready for supper. It's gonna be really fine this time. You'll see, Alison. You're gonna be proud of Mommy. Of what Mommy's going to do. Be a good girl. And say your prayers. Remember, I love you. Bye, sweetie. Damn! Oh, not again! Oh, at last. Coming! Everything's ready for you. Hi, there, I... Hi, there. Hi, I'm sorry if I frightened you. You didn't frighten me. - Well you didn't answer right away. Ah, I was in the kitchen. I'm expecting company any minute. Ah, in fact, I thought you were him. Who? My company. - When you didn't answer right away, I went around to the back. I thought there might be another way in. There's not. I mean, I'm- - You mean this is the only way in that you're aware of. Yes. Yeah, I thought so. I wonder if I might use your telephone. My car's broken down six or seven miles down the road on the edge of the forest. I'd like to call a tow truck. Oh, well, um. - This is the only house around here for miles. Believe me, I know. - No, you're wrong, there are others. - Not near, I've walked around and around in circles. I doubt there are many public phone booths standing around in the trees. - Um... - Listen, if I'm making an unreasonable request. It's a reasonable request. Of course you can use the phone. Thank you. Won't you come back inside? The storm's getting closer, hmm. You're shivering. You're not. I don't feel the cold. That's lucky, isn't it? Especially on a night like this. Ah, the phone's right over there on the table. - Thank you, I really appreciate it. You're very polite. Your mother teach you that? Sorry? You keep apologizing. Oh, right. Mark of a good upbringing. Or a sheltered existence. Suddenly thrust out in the arena. Don't you like it? - It takes a bit of getting used to. Maybe they shouldn't let me out. Running off the road into the ditch the way I did. Well, anyone can blow a tire. I've done it myself. Glass. What? Glass on the road. Ran over it than backed up. - It would have been a back tire if you'd done that. What? - Your back tire would have blown first, not your front tire. - I guess I'm luck they both didn't blow. It's funny you knew it was a front tire. Good guess. Yeah, wasn't it. All right if I call? - There you again being so polite. Too much of that can make a person nervous. Did your mother tell you that? No. What did she tell you? - Beware of strange young girls in the forest asking too many questions. - No she didn't. - No. - Go ahead, I said it was all right. Thanks. Busy. That was really remarkable. What? - That you knew the number without having to look it up. Does that bother you? Of course it does. I mean, here you are out in the middle of nowhere, you stumble upon a cabin in the clearing, you pick up the receiver and you the know the number to dial. You keep a list of tow truck numbers for all areas in your head? That's good. - What's good? - Your observation. I mean, you can't be too careful, can you? No, you can't. - If it'll put your mind at rest, I looked up the number in my AAA book before I left the car. Hmm. Let's see. Yes, hello, is this Al's Towaway? Hi, listen, I've broken down right on the edge of the forest. A little side road off Highway 41. Yeah, I pulled over in a ditch under some trees. Yes, I know how late it is. Look, AI, is this AI? There is no Al? Look, I know it's late, I'm lucky I found a telephone. Make it my lucky night, will ya? Come tow me in. I don't care what the rate is after 1 O o'clock. I'll pay ya double. I'm six or seven miles from the car. You can pick me up at, hang on. Where are we? He can't pick you up here. - Listen, I don't wanna impose any further on your hospitality. - I haven't got the time to be entertaining. - Well, I don't need to be entertained. Just let me flop down anywhere. Been known to sit without moving for hours at a time. Sorry, I'm still here. Look, just a tricky spot of negotiation. One more sentence, he's gonna hang up. I mean, he'll have to come here. There's nowhere else for him to go to. Unless you drive me to the car. I can't do that. Oh right, expecting company. I've got a flat tire too. Really? Coke bottle? How did you know that? Oh, well just a lucky guess. I mean, plenty of Coke bottles about. No spare? No. Youtree Cottage. That's the address. He'll know. Hello, yeah, sorry. Youtree Cottage, Cutter's Ridge. Yeah, how long will it take you to get here? 15 minutes. 15 minutes is fine. I really appreciate it. Yeah, bye. Thank you. - I could hardly refuse, could I? - Well it's your house, you can do whatever you like, can't you? Can I? As far as I'm concerned. Thank you. Now you're being polite. Did your mother teach you that? Yes, she did. As a matter of fact. - It's funny, isn't it, when two strangers meet. So polite, testing each other. We don't have to remain strangers. Yes, we do. What's your name? - What do you want it to be? - Names, just convenient handles, aren't they? I mean, you could change your name to Tracy, Angela, Lily. It'd Still be you, wouldn't it? Whoever that may be. - How did you know this place was at Cutter's Ridge? There's a sign. It blew down last week. - Well somebody must have put it back up. Oh yeah, somebody must have. - Listen, I think I better wait outside. I'm obviously disturbing you. You're expecting company. Probably got pots bubbling away on the stove. It's not fair to disrupt your routine. - Well, unless you had no choice. Yeah. Well I'll just hang around on the porch, if that's okay? Al said 15 minutes, huh. I appreciate the use of the phone. And the chat. Thanks again. - You don't have to wait outside. I'll be fine. All these trees. Lightning rods. I wouldn't want something to happen to you. - You don't have to worry about me. - I'm just a little nervous tonight. I don't like storms. Really, come back in. Please. Would you care for a drink? No, thank you. Isn't that customary? Offer a stranger a drink. Especially on a cold, stormy night. I don't drink. Thank you. - After a six mile hike through that forest, I'd sure want one. Or was it longer? Your hike? - Oh, about seven miles. - I saw your T-Bird on the side of the road this morning. Really? Well that would make me a liar then, wouldn't it? So what's your explanation? - It's easy, I don't own a Thunderbird. It must be some other poor jerk. You don't mind if I do? Go ahead. How long have you lived here? You ask a lot of questions. - I've always had an inquisitive mind. Even as a youngster. I like to know about people. - What do you wanna know about me? Everything. You haven't got much time. Do you wanna crash course in human behavior? Do you live here alone? - Oh, my friend- - Oh, yeah, friend. Forgot about him He lives here too, does he? Part of the time. And when he's not here, does the sense of isolation get to you? Do you feel trapped? I don't feel trapped anywhere. Well, too strong a word. - I'll be leaving here very soon, actually. Will you? Yes. Good. Well until then, this is a very nice little oasis. I like it. I'm so glad. Nice, beautiful colors. You've gotta be careful with tropical fish. They're delicate. A sudden rise in temperature, a little too hot. Unexpected chill. Gone. My husband gave them to me. Please leave the fish alone. They don't like being disturbed. Is this your husband here? Yes, they're family slides. Please, put them down. It's no coincidence you're here, is it? - What do you mean? - You've been following me. What are you talking about? - This morning, in town, coming out of the supermarket, at the gas station. ls someone watching you? You saw him? - Felt him. - You can't trust feelings like that. It could just be your own paranoia. There's somebody watching you, I show up at your door. Association of ideas. That could be dangerous. This is unusual. My husband collected them. Is that who we're waiting for? - No. - No, I didn't think so. Your hands are trembling. - What? - Your hands, trembling. It spoils the illusion, gives the game away. The thing about games, you gotta know the rules. You've gotta play fair. Trembling, that's not playing fair, that's playing on my sympathies. What are they? Depends on the person. It's a little cold in here. That's why I trembled. - It's a great fire, should be nice and warm. Can't you tell? Oh, that's right. You don't get cold. Or hot. No. Never sweat? - Hmm? - Do you ever sweat? No, I don't. Too bad. Perspiration is good for you. You should give yourself a tough workout. I do that every day. - I hope it's with somebody nice. It's a little cold in here. I shivered, is that all right with you? It's a scary kinda night. I understand, I really do, it's all right. It's not me, is it? - What? - That's frightening you? - I told you, I'm not frightened. I've had a lot of nights like this. I'm used to them, they don't bother me anymore. - Not at all? - No. You are frightened. It's all right, thunder can't hurt you. But lightning can. - Discharge of electricity from one cloud to another. It can be conducted. It can kill. Recognize the show? It doesn't matter. They're all the same. Cop shows, two guys in uniform. One street smart, the other's white-bread. Sparks fly between them. Different backgrounds, different philosophies. But slowly under adversity, they're forced to work together. Sound familiar? Or do you work alone? What are you talking about? Like us, you and I. And what are we working on? - Murder. - What? - Isn't that what all criminal partners work on? Murder? Whether they're cops in uniforms or private detectives. They're all about murder. Yeah, I guess they are. I wonder if that tow truck's arrived. The thing about murder... The circumstances of murder is that they don't have to be complicated. The way mystery writers work them out, the best murders are always the simple ones. I wouldn't know. - If you were going to murder someone, what's the first thing you'd do? - Ah, I'd guess I'd establish the identity of the victim. No, you already know her. Or his identity. You isolate your victim. You put him in a set of circumstances in which he's disoriented. You trap him. Then you cover your tracks carefully. You for instance. Who knows you're here? No one. Al the towing man. - You're a voice on a telephone to him. Police call on me, I say you were never here. - They trace the call, it'll be recorded at the phone company. - I say a man was here who's car had broken down. He wanted to use my telephone. He didn't give me his name. He didn't believe in names. I give the police a different description. I say his car was right near my front porch. He got it going with my help and drove off. - And where do the police find me? They don't. You're chopped up. Little pieces scattered to the forest animals. How do you like it so far? It's good. But what about the motive? You don't even know me. - I could be someone out of your past. A name you've forgotten. A sister of a lover you jilted, who hung herself one lonely night in her room. The daughter of a man you cheated out of his business. The wife of a man you killed on the highway and you never stopped. - And I just happened to find this house, you house, in the middle of Nowhere Land, and you just happen to be the lady of the house who's waiting to do me in. I don't think anybody would buy that. That's right. I'd be safe and you'd be dead. The circumstances would be just right. Too far fetched, even for one of your cop shows. - What if the real circumstances were different? Like your car breaking down. Does that happen to you often? Like anyone else. - I fixed your car to break down. That's how I know it was the Thunderbird. - That's too far away from the house. You got here. - I could have gone in another direction. - There's only one path through the forest. All my lights were on. Beckoning you through the trees. You arrive and check me out through the windows. I'm taking a shower. I'm naked. Vulnerable. I don't see you at my window or I'd cover myself up, wouldn't I? Natural modesty. You feel confident. You knock on the door, I open it. I'm surprised to see you. You ask if you can use the telephone. You come into the warm. Away from the night. Away from the storm. Feeling safe. Feeling good. Perhaps even a little attracted to me. And then? And then I kill you. You know what happens then? Tell me. She can't go through with it. She's prepared it for weeks. Perhaps even months. She's ready for this moment. - You see, our murderess made one basic mistake. She let herself get too close. In her moment of triumph, she told him too much. She took a calculated risk and it failed. And then? Then the victim turned on his would be killer and choked the very life out out of her. Please don't! - Is she sorry she's been playing silly games with him? Ow, God, please! - In that moment it's all for real. And there won't be anymore games for wifey to play on strangers who come in from the night because suddenly the girl becomes very, very dead. You wanna theorize more on murder and death, I've got five more minutes. You scared the hell out of me, girl. Oh, you've spilled your drink. Here. Is this him, is it? The one we're waiting for? Give me that. Good looking bloke. But not your husband. Your husband's dead, isn't he? - How could you possibly know that? - Faithful, that's the way I read you. You wouldn't be waiting for a lover with your husband still in the picture. I could be divorced. - Most divorces I know don't still wear their wedding rings. Good deduction. Not bad, huh? Was it an accident? My husband died in the war. Oh yes, of course, the war. Violent death then, was it? It must have been. You weren't there? Of course I wasn't there. - Well a lot of young women in the war, but not you? I couldn't go. I had to look after my daughter. At a party tonight, is she? She's away from home. Staying with friends? With people her own age. Rug rats. I've always loved that expression. Conjures up just the right picture, doesn't it? Little rats crawling around the floor. - I don't look at children that way! Does she really exist? I looked in her bedroom. When? - When I was trying to find a way in. Through the window. Teddy bears, dolls, all dismembered. Did she get a kick out of that? Nice personality she must have. I saw a hat box. Odd, that. I mean, most little girls don't wear hats. Except at Easter time. It's none of your business. So naturally, I believe, there's a little girl in the house. But you know what I really saw? A big girl, and you were right, naked, vulnerable. Beautiful. - Is that why you knocked on the door? Is that why you came into the house? - How did Alison take the news of her father's death? How did you know her name? Point to you. Thanks. - I have an answer, picture in her room, needlepoint on the wall, "To Mommy, Love Alison." It's dark in that room. I have good eyesight. Huh, you're really remarkable. You have an unusual accent. I've been trying to place it. - London. - London, really? Oh, I wouldn't have thought that. - Why's that? Thick pea soup fog. Isn't that the way London's always thought of? Narrow cobble streets. Carriage wheels clicking by. Long bladed knife, glinting out of the darkness. Jack the Ripper claiming yet another victim. Slicing her throat with one easy, graceful movement. Who else should come out of the night? Do you want one? No thanks. - Slowly whittling down your vices. You don't drink, you don't smoke. I hope you have a nice girlfriend somewhere. Oh yes, I do. She's very beautiful. Maybe you should call her and tell her that you're all right. She knows. What's in here? Ooh! Heart pounding there for a minute. I thought someone was gonna jump out at me. Your lover with an ax. Mm, you have set dinner for two. I told you. - You're expecting him to arrive any minute. But if you weren't expecting your lover, here's a nice dining table set for two. And here I am arriving out of the night. Just like you were expecting me. Oh, this is a nice warm room. Pots bubbling away on the stove. Look, I've tried to be as- Kind as possible. Entertaining. Even a spot of high drama, a knife at the throat. Are you sure you want me to leave? Your 15 minutes are up. I'll wait outside then. - If he doesn't come soon, you can use the phone again. Thank you very much. No more questions. No more questions for tonight. Anyway, you have all the answers, don't you? - If I had all the answers, I wouldn't be here. Good night. - You better lock up. You never know what might come out of the night. It may not be someone as easy going as me. You know what I mean? Good night. Bullets. I have no bullets. What's the matter with you? You stepped right out in front of me. Is that how you drive? No wonder you wrecked your car. Pick up any bodies along the way? - I'm sorry, I was driving too fast. Mind elsewhere, I must have been thinking of you. Here, I'll help you back to the car. I can manage. Good looking machine. Yeah, Al's Towaway. This is a loner? All he had available. You must have spilled something sticky. I wonder what it is? I wouldn't know. Then who would? It's your car. Yes, it is. Funny thing, there are plenty of cars parked around here but you knew mine. I saw it at the cabin. - It was in the garage. Well, I must have seen it through the door from the kitchen. That door was closed. Really? Point to you. I thought you had a flat. How did you get here? I'm not helpless. I can change a tire. You told me you had no spare. - I took the tire off that wrecked T-Bird. - What? - Last night. I took a hike through the woods. Found the T-bird, took the wheel off. I like that, I really do. You know, you must get tired driving this old bone crusher. Fancy a ride? Handles like a dream, doesn't she? Slow down! You're not gonna make it! - Watch your hands! Look out! - Oh, you should see your face, girl. Quite a picture. Whoo-hoo! Whoo. - I've never been up this high before. Oh! Don't get too near the edge. We don't want any accidents. It could be tragic. Yes, that would be tragic. - Come on, I wanna take your photograph by the car. Come on. - What? - Come on, I wanna take your photograph. Right here. Stand by the door. Okay? That's good, now look over here. That's nice, okay, say cheese. Cheese. Okay, look over here. What's the matter, are you going to a funeral? Come on, one more. Here. Perfect. Now you. Uh-uh. Give me the camera. - No, no, no, no. - Let me take your photograph. - No, no, I don't- - Come on. - I don't take a good photograph. - Come on, I'm good at this. Over here, there's a good spot. I don't know. Right here. Okay, whoa! All right. - Okay, now smile for the camera. Oh, come on now, relax, relax. Now look this way, I need you to face this way. That's it that's it. What's the matter? Haven't you ever had your picture taken before? Good, good. Good. Terrific. Terrific. - That's enough. Okay, that's enough, that's enough. - I just wanted a few to remind myself. In case you forget me? - Oh, I'll never forget you as long as I live. I mean, you're one hell of a driver. Who could ever forget that ride. Time for you to go home. You're the chauffeur. Thanks for the spin. Oh my God. That's where it is. So you just let yourself in? Just like you were invited. I wanted to see the photos. How did they turn out? Just the way I wanted. These are my memories. You have no right to help your self to them. True, I can't touch memories. But what good are they? The past is over, the future, that's what you should be thinking about. I lam. - I just wanted to make sure you were in good nick, as they say down the old Portobello Raod. You look a little green after our ride this morning. Tell me about London. Portobello Road. When were you there? Some time ago. - I think it's the most beautiful city in the world. All that history piled in on those modern skyscrapers. The old and the new coexisting. That's not easy. Know what I mean? Sure. - I remember walking down Piccadilly with Green Park on your left. Then Soho will be on your right when you reach the Circus. With the Houses of Parliament standing there regally on the river. And then you turn one half step, and there's the Coca Cola sign in Piccadilly Circus, blazing red. The old and the new. I know what you mean. You're a liar. Why do you say that? - You've never been to London in your life. If you walked down Piccadilly, Green Park is on your right, but Soho will be on your left. You'd have to walk down Whitehall to see the Houses of Parliament. And you would have corrected me about that Coca Cola sign because they took it down years ago. I see. So you've been to London, have you? So you're not British. And you didn't breakdown on the edge of the forest, and you're a liar. What else are you? Maybe I'm a cop. Maybe that's why I'm here. Give me a break. You don't know that I'm not. Where's your badge and ID? Oh, come on now. I wouldn't be carrying that, would I? Not if I'm working undercover. At what precinct? Or is it the sheriff's station? Why don't we just go and give them a call? It wouldn't prove a thing. Why don't you just listen to me? Maybe I know more about you than you realize. About your dead husband. The one who's supposed to have died in the war. You've got proof of that, have you? Of course! I asked for his body to be shipped home so I can hang it in the closet. A letter from the authorities. A few kind words. "Dear Mrs. So and So, it's about your husband Bill." I've never told you his name. - Well, I must have seen it somewhere around the house. "To my Dearest Wife, Love Bill." Something like that. I saw his body. You did. Lifeless eyes staring up at you. Skin cold to the touch. How could you do that? I had to be sure. Don't go in there. - What are you afraid I might see? Huh, the boyfriend! Is he coming over tonight? - Yes he is and you'll have to leave. Use your bathroom before I go? Even cops with no evidence have to go sometimes. Except tele cops, they've got bladders made of steel. Down the hall? Put it down. - Whatever's in here, it's leaking. I said put it down now! I never heard of a hat leaking. You know what I think? I think you haven't got a hat in here at all. Something else. Something that goes under a hat? I said put it down. Gently, we don't wanna disturb what's in here, do we? Hmm, it's hard to tell what it is. Get out of here. - What's so special about this room? It's my daughter's room. - There hasn't been a little girl in here for a long time. You can feel it when a room's not been lived in. It's cold, unfriendly. Putting out little broken dolls won't change that. It just makes it sad. All this makeup. It's a bit too much for a little girl of... How old did you say she was? Nine, 10? I don't know of it, myself. Painting their little faces. Get away from there. Why, what's in here? Usual junk in a little girl's closet? Broken bits of this and that? Games, puzzles? Maybe a doll's house. - It doesn't matter what's in there. What are you doing in this room? - Took a wrong turn and found myself in Wonderland. But no little Alice. No little Alison, either. But I do feel her presence. Her tears. Mourning the murder of her daddy. - I said- - It's all murder, isn't it? Wartime, peacetime. Poor sad Alison. People always keep them in the same places, don't they? You might as well keep it in the door. Evidence, not hard to find when you have the key. No! You are not allowed in there! - The thing about looking for evidence, you're never quite sure what you're gonna find. Well now, someone's idea of a joke? Not yours, I hope. No! Well you're the only one here. You're here. Oh, I did this, did I? When? - Before I got in here. Oh right. Yeah, I found the doll, unlocked the closet door, strangled it, locked the door again and waited for you to arrive. Do me a favor. You knew there was something in that closet. You didn't want me to open the door. Did you? So if it wasn't you, who was it? Not your husband, long dead. Your lover then? He must be lots of laughs at parties. He didn't do it. No, I don't suspect he did. And the genuine item, the little girl herself, where is she tonight? Do you know what I think? Your daughter's never coming back to this room. Get out! - I thought I'd take a look in your closet. See if I could find anything. But I didn't. Please. - Oh, oh, I'm sorry if I frightened you. You left these out on the dresser. You shouldn't leave them open like that. It's dangerous. Yes. It's all right. You've had a bad scare. That doll. I didn't do it. I believe you, I do. You're safe. Nothing's gonna happen tonight. Don't leave me. I don't want you to leave me. You have to stay. You, you want me to stay? Yes. Please. What do you want me to do? Hold me. Just hold me. - That's why you took the ride with me, wasn't it? Yes. - You left the back door open this time. Yes. - You wanted me to come back tonight. Yes. Say it. You wanted me to be here. I wanted you to be here. And tomorrow night. And tomorrow night. Use them. Oh, come on. This is what you wanted. This is why you're here. Come, come on. I can't. I can't do it. It's all right. I understand. I really do. Oh, God! Everything's under control. It's all right. You came back. - I saw the lightning hit the roof. - The fire! - It's all right. It's all right. It's out. Oh, don't worry about me, I mean. I'm all right, if that's what you were gonna ask. You saved my life. - I couldn't very well let you burn up, now could I? You saved my life I had no choice. No. You're limping. Yeah, dangerous out there. Bear traps lying around in the trees. Oh! Is that how you do it? Wait for some poor unsuspecting guy to step in it? Gash his leg, come limping up to the house for help. Of course the lady of the house is very sympathetic. "Here, let me bandage that for you. Actually, I've set the table for two. It looks like my boyfriend isn't gonna make it tonight. Would you care to join me?" "After dinner, I can hang you in the closet." Gonna stab me with that, were you? After I went through all the trouble to save your life. After we made love. We didn't make love. Better let go. Get dressed. - You're gonna die, you son of a bitch. Get out! Get out! Get away from there! Stay away! No! Oh, no. No. No. Oh, what happened to it? - You planned it all, didn't you? Your husband didn't die in the war. You topped him, stabbed him with those scissors. And there's your boyfriend, the man who's coming to dinner. Except he never makes it because you chopped his head off in the woods! No! Your daughter's dead! No, it's not true! - You killed her, dismembered her, scattered the pieces! No! No, she's alive! I talked to her last night on the telephone! Wanna call the police? Ask for me at the sheriff station. Go ahead. Pick up the phone. Pick it up! It's dead. - Well now, look at the state of this. So you dial a dead phone and you talk to a dead daughter. No! You did that. - Oh, I stripped away the phone wire, did I? Just like I hung the doll in your daughter's closet, like I started the fire in the garage? - What about Al's Towing Service? Who did you talk to last night if this phone line's been dead for such a long time? - You caught me on that one. Point to you. That's right. You tore that out of the wall after I talked to Alison and before you supposedly talked to Al. Another point to you. You're really wracking them up tonight, aren't you? You could have killed me. Only if I'd wanted to. Good night. Four minutes, two seconds. Pretty fast time. I can do better. For what? Who's gonna know how fast you just ran? I'll know. - You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. You look beautiful running. Fluid motion. I didn't know you could do that. Very impressive. Stop watching me. Stop following me. Leave me alone. - If I do that how are you gonna make anymore points? No more points. No more games. - I see, dictating the terms now, are you? It's just a warning. Really? I'd like to hear it. If I see you again, I'll kill you. Don't be late. Not tonight. Celebration time. You did awfully well. I'm really proud of you. Thank you. Won't you come on back inside? Have a glass of Champagne? Good photos, clever, ah? I thought you'd appreciate it. Sorry. I must have broken it. - Like you broke the other dolls in her room. Cut their heads off, pulled their limbs out. Like the doll you left in the glove compartment of your car. Very careless. You found that. Good. First point to me. It proved you'd been in the house. In Alison's room. That's not in the rules. We agreed on that. You can't change the rules anytime you want. Not without consulting me. - Well, we're getting very important all of a sudden. I am important. I'll tell you why you went into Alison's room. Secrets, you wanted to know my secrets. I've been getting on your nerves. - You know that's not possible. - No? - Let me tell you something. I give you privileges and you abuse them. I let you go out of the house so you can have a nice stroll. You steal the tire off my car. Not in the rules. It's in my rules. You didn't expect to play by those. Well, you're grounded. Fine. I don't need the car anymore. - That's right, you can run. Oh, how you can run. Just a little bit too desperate for those last few seconds. I'll make it. - Well you're not gonna get the chance, are you? Are you sure of that? Of course I'm sure. Arrogance. You hear that emotion in your voice? Like you can't do any of it wrong. But you made mistakes. Oh, how you made mistakes. Everything I offered you on that first night, I would have offered any human being coming in out of the storm. But you couldn't accept. - Points to you, you've made these points before. But I made new ones, didn't I? I caught you on that tow truck. You could have looked it up in the AAA book. But then you said this place was at Cutter's Ridge, which you could have never known because that sign did blow down. Come on, I counted that. Somebody could have put it back up. - There isn't anybody to put it back up. More points to me. Did you ever wonder how I drove into town after you had stolen my keys? I have a spare set. Secrets, my secrets. You knew my Land Rover in town, how? Then there was your phony British accent. Dangerous because there's no way you ever could have been to England. All right, that was good. All points to me. You're bored with this game. You need some new excitement. You look at the television, see a cop show and decide to become a cop. Investigating the murder of my husband. It sure was fun being a cop. - But I proved your entire identity was a lie. You couldn't even build up a convincing murder case. - The evidence did point to the fact you could have killed both your husband and your lover. But not Alison. Not my daughter. You knew that couldn't be true. - Psychopaths aren't discriminating. You should have watched yourself, girl. You looked pretty schizo to me. - Try being locked up somewhere for two years. See how it modifies your behavior. Oh, I forgot, that wouldn't do anything to you. Or would it? You creep into my little girl's room, strangle one of her dolls and hide it in the closet for me to find. Pretty schizo. I found it. - You made sure I was in the room first. You wanted me to know there was something in that closet. You wanted me to think for just one awful moment that that was my baby girl hanging in there. Get the picture? A little madness creeping into your psyche. That was spiteful, vindictive. Dark-sided emotions beginning to guide your every move. Oh, you jumped. I love it when you jump. I like observing emotions. Sure, I'm scared. But that's part of the game. That's what you bank on. But I reached out to you in my fear and you couldn't do anything about it. A real man could have made love to me. Shut up! - How many points for humiliation? - Look, if it was up to me I'd take points away from you for that little stunt. How many? All right, you did well. 10. Wait a minute. I saved your life last night. - You don't give a damn about my life. You'd just be in a lot of trouble if your prized guinea pig died on you. Oh, she's not gonna do that. She's gonna play the game for a long, long time. Let's have a toast. To the little victories you've won along the way. - Oh, but little victories add up, don't they? What have we got so far, 30 points? How much for the photos? 10, I told you. Clever. - How did you get in here tonight? Well does that matter? Of course it matters. Every door and window was locked except Alison's window. You opened my daughter's window. So what? You opened her window that first night yourself. - It doesn't matter if I opened it. You have to be the one to do it and tonight you did. All right, 10 for the photos. How much for Alison's window being opened by you? Let's call it nine. - That leaves just- - One more point and you'll be at 50. The magic number. It's a biggie, isn't it? Tell me. - You really thought you had it made this time. It's a good photo of you. I'm sorry, I, I found this by your lover's body. No. - Now perhaps it was a mistake to have him live here for five days a month. He tried to escape. You can't escape unless you're prepared. Now he's dead. I don't believe you. Look in the refrigerator. What? Top shelf. I brought you a souvenir to go along with your little bag of memories. What are you... Open the refrigerator door. I borrowed your ax a few days ago. - You didn't have to sever his hand. It makes no difference to him. I just thought it would keep better in there until I could give you his ring. Tell me... - What? - The last point! What's the last point? You really don't know? Getting passed me, that's all. Come on. You're not gonna fire that thing. It's over, girl. Next week you can try again. - No next week, no next month, no next year! I'm getting out of here tonight. Give me the crossbow. I'll fire. Well it won't have any effect. You know that. Come on. Give it to me. No, no! - How many other people are left? Thousands. And their children? Alison? They're all safe. Part of the experiment. Separate the families. Observe the parents. Retrain the children. - How far is the children's compound? Six miles. You'll never make it! The force field! It goes off, it goes off. Now that I've won. It goes back on. I know how much time I've got. You will never escape. Yes, I will. One by one, we'll all escape. They'll kill you. You think so? Too bad you won't be around to watch. So long, pal. Mommy, help! Mommy, over here! - No! - Mommy! No, she's not there! I'm gonna continue on. Give her to me! - Mommy! Mommy, help! Mommy! No! Over here, Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! Alison! Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, I'm scared! Mommy! I love you, Mommy! Do something, Mommy, come on! Mommy, Mommy! Mommy! Hello, girl. No! You bastard. How many... How many have you... Callers? As many as they need. I think you'll find the Mach 2 version to be a vast improvement. But it's not fair! I won! You did. Brilliantly executed. You ran beyond the force field in under four minutes. Your human feelings betrayed you. What a pity you came back. We never considered that he could have feelings. You really worked him over, didn't you? I won't be making the same mistakes. Come on, girl. Let me take you back to the beginning. I can't. Think of the new challenges. Here we are together. The new team. I think you can do it this time. I really do. I can't. I can't. Sheriff's department, ma'am. There's some questions I'd like to ask you about your late husband. May I come in? Oh, please. I've been expecting you.
