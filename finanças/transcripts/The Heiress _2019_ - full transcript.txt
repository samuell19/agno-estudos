[mysterious music playing] WELCOME TO SITIO MAUPAY [birds chirping] [tracks rattling] [chain whirring] [tense dramatic music playing] [grunting] [groaning] [loud groaning] [heavy breathing] -Help! -[eerie ghost voice in the background] Help me! Help! [eerie ghost voice in the background] [eerie music playing] [eerie ghost voice in the background] [grunts, panicked breathing] [loud scream] [screams] [groaning, panting] [pained moaning] [sloshing sound] [panicked moaning] [screaming] [crying] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [eerie ghost voice chanting] [eerie ghost voice chanting] [Yolly] There are so many things in this house that I haven't been able to do ever since Father died. And I'll be leaving for Italy at the end of the month. I talked to Carmen on Skype. When is she coming home from Barcelona? I don't know. This is the last luggage, Auntie. -Is it? -[Yolly] Is she the one? Is this Carmen's daughter? Look how much you've grown! Such a pretty girl! You were just a small child when I last went to Maupay on vacation. Now you've become a beautiful lady! When did you last see your mother? Uhm… It's been a while. Five years. Five years? Are you two on good terms? Yes. [Luna] Not as often. Only on certain occasions. Carmen's been in Barcelona for a long time, hasn't she? Oh, there is another unopened box. Let me help. Let me help you. -[dramatic music playing] -Never touch this box. [tense music playing] Why are you mad? I'm just trying to help. What's inside? Gold bars? You've always been so mysterious. That's why you became an old maid. Nobody wanted to marry you. [laughing] -[Yolly] Let's just open this box. -[rat squeaking] [gasping] Auntie, there's a rat! A rat? A rat! There's a rat! -[screaming] A rat! A rat! -[rat squeaking] -[squishing noise] -[groaning] [gasps] [birds chirping] Auntie? Guia? Yes? Uh… I found a flower outside. It's the last one. Everything else died. Isn't it beautiful? Is there anything that's more beautiful than you? [giggling] I will get some curtains. Help me hang them. I will. [exhales] [ghostly breathing] [somber music playing] I want you to be careful every time you commute going to school. Auntie. Don't worry about me. I am not a kid anymore. I can take care of myself. Just promise me. Never trust anyone you meet, no matter how nice they are. Never forget that. One more thing. After school, make sure you go home immediately. Is that clear? Yes. Auntie. I think we should have this mirror fixed. Our faces look scary with those cracks. [indistinct chatter] [girl] Look at her outfit. [girl laughing] Why does she look like that? [girl in English] Old-fashioned. [girl] Hurry up. We're late! You're such a slowpoke. Hurry! [gasping] [Renz] Hey! Watch where you're going! Let me help. Here you go. It's fixed. [gentle music playing] [in English] Miss! Wait! [birds chirping] [rustling] [ghost breathing eerily] -[eerie music playing] -[birds chirping] [Guia] Hello, mama? [mother] Hello, Guia? How are you? I'm okay. I miss you so much. We'll see each other soon. Where are you now? I'm at school. Heading to my next class. Okay. Take care. I will. -Is the phone working? -[gasps] Thank you. No problem. I just pieced it together. -[crowd chattering] -I'm Renz, by the way. [gentle music playing] Guia. What? -[crowd chattering] -Guia. Guia. Guia. -[sudden musical sting] -[Yolly] What's that for? Can't you knock first? Why would I do that? The door is already open, and I own this house. What is that? It stinks. This is for body pain and muscle aches. Why waste time when you can find that in Quiapo. Who is sick and why do you have to do that? What are you doing here? What do you want? I have to tell you, Luna, Carmen and I talked over Skype. She said she'll send money for rent, but it hasn't arrived yet, and I'll be leaving for Italy soon. Can you pay me instead? Thirty thousand pesos. I just need to buy dollars. I don't have money. You don't have your own money? You're relying on Carmen for everything? That's why she asked you to look after her daughter and you became an old maid. You can't move on from Ruben. -[intense music playing] -[gasps] Don't you dare say his name. [buzzing] [unsettling music playing] [grunting] Go away! [annoyed exclamation] [screaming] That hurts, Luna! [breathes heavily] Alright, I'm leaving. Just tell Carmen to pay the rent as soon as possible. I really need that money. [unsettling music playing] [car engine starting] [chanting] [dramatic music playing] Andoy, what's taking you so long? We're in a hurry! -This will be quick. -Make it fast! -Ma'am! -[gasps] Don't startle me like that! -What is it? -I'll just buy water. Alright! Make it quick! Go on! [moans] [scoffs] [sighs] [eerie ghostly chanting] -[dramatic music playing] -[screaming] [screaming] [eerie ghostly chanting] [screaming] [groaning, nervous panting] [heavy breathing] [moaning] [pained groaning] [retching] [vomiting] [dramatic music playing] [screaming] [pained shouting] [groaning] [screaming] [Guia] Uh… [Guia] Auntie. Mama called me. She said she's coming home. You spoke to her? When is she coming home? She didn't tell me when. But she said it will be soon. What else did you talk about? Nothing else. She asked me if she can buy me anything. I said it's up to her. That's about it. Auntie. It feels weird to see her again. Why is that? [phone beeps] HI, GUIA. THIS IS RENZ. REMEMBER ME? [Luna] Who messaged you? Is that your mother? Uh… Uh… Just a classmate. Is it a girl? Yes. Auntie, I'm okay now. Thank you. [somber music playing] [eerie ghostly voice in the background] [gasps] [eerie ghostly voice in the background] [eerie ghostly voice continues] [screams, groans, moaning] [whimpering] [sobbing] [panicked breathing] [crackling] [gulping] [tense music playing] [creaking] [whimpering] [whimpering] [Carmen] Last one. Just put all the luggage here. -[man] Yes. -Thank you! [Carmen] Luna! Luna! What are you doing here? I really meant to surprise you! Where is Guia? Where's my daughter? -[dripping] -[gasps] [unsettling music playing] Huh? [eerie ghostly voice in the background] [eerie ghostly voice continues in the background] [door creaking] [panicked breathing] Miss? -[sudden musical sting] -[gasping] [breathing heavily] [screaming] [shrieking] [indistinct chattering] [girl] What's the matter with you? Are you sick? [girl speaks English] Hello, are you okay? [giggling] [giggling continues] [laughing] What a weirdo. [Carmen] Luna. I won't renew my contract. I won't be going back to Barcelona. [Luna] Wait. Are you sure about your decision? Yes. I want to be with my daughter. [thunder rumbles] Guia! [nervous laughing] I know I have so much explaining to do. I don't even know where to start. To make you understand. [sighs] I had so many problems in Barcelona. That's why I couldn't come home. [sobbing] I won't leave you now. I'm staying here for good. [in English] Guia, I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. Guia. I have enough money for us. We'll live together. In our own house. [sniffs] I'd like to sleep now. [somber music playing] [door creaking] [tense music playing] [eerie ghostly voice in the background] -[thud] -[gasps] [squeaking] [squeaking continues] [creaking] [creaking continues] [scratching] Guia? -[loud bang] -[gasps] [panicked breathing] [door creaking] [creaking] Guia. Guia. -[sudden musical sting] -[screaming] [nervous breathing] [tense music playing] Guia! Renz? Where are you going? To the cafeteria. Can I go with you? Okay. You might bump into someone again. [Carmen] Luna. I have no intention of going back to Barcelona. What about you? Your job? [sighs] I'll just start a business here. A small one. I want to stay here with my daughter and make it up to her. But we are… We're fine right here. [heavy breathing] We're doing just fine. Luna, you've already sacrificed a lot for her. I think it is time you look after yourself. You know what? I don't understand you. Don't you want to have your own family? You can go back home to Maupay. I can give you money to start over. You can open your own business there. Do you want me to leave? -[sober music playing] -[gasping] No, it's not like that! I'm giving you freedom to do the things you haven't done because you took care-- I chose this life! Guia still needs me. She still needs my protection. Whether or not you are here. So, how are you doing? [sighs] I'm still trying to adapt. This isn't like anything back home. I know the feeling. I'm also from the province. I moved here to come to high school until I was able to adapt. I'm sure you'll get by. There. I just need to drop by the library. Sure. See you at the cafeteria? Okay! Okay. [in English] Bye. [in English] Bye. [thunder rolling] [sinister music playing] Auntie? [unsettling music playing] [phone ringing] Hello, mama? Hello, Guia? What time will you get off today? Why? I'll pick you up. Let's go to the mall. I'll buy you a laptop. You've had yours for five years already. The laptop you gave me still works. Mama. Did Auntie Luna leave the house today? No. She was just ironing the clothes. She never left. You want to talk to her? -[unsettling music playing] -No, it's fine. I was just asking. [in English] Excuse me? People are waiting in line. [in English] Sorry. I have to go, Mama. [girl chattering] Hurry up. I'll have noodles. [girl] It's too hot! [girl] Hey, girl! Have you seen Gino's Instagram story? Your ex has a new girl! Such an asshole! Girl, she's pretty! I'm prettier than her! No, she's prettier. She's very pretty. -No, look I'm prettier! -She's classy! [girl] But you're more beautiful. -[sudden musical sting] -[slithering noise] [screams] [tense music playing] [Renz] Guia! What happened to you? Guia. [scratching] [panicked breathing] [panicked breathing] [knocking] [panicked breathing] -[eerie ghostly voice] -[panicked breathing] -[pained moaning] -[high pitch eerie sound playing] -[gasping] -[sudden musical sting] -What's wrong with you? -[panicked breathing] [pained groaning] You should rest. I'll wait for Guia. [pained moaning] [somber music playing] [eerie ghost voice in the background] Please give me more time! Just a little bit more. I need time. Then you can have her! For the Coven! [sudden musical sting] [gasps, shrieks] [moaning] G… G-U… G-U-I… G-U-I-A Thank you for the ride. Anytime. -Wait. -Mm? Here, take this. It may be cheesy, but this is a sign of our friendship. Thank you. Welcome. -[giggles] -I'll be going. [in English] Good night. [gentle music playing] Are you sure you aren't coming to the mall? You know I'm not fond of malls. I hate crowded places. Just go with your mother. You will enjoy it. Luna? We might stay out late tonight. We'll have dinner at the mall. [scraping] We'll go now, Auntie. My hand stinks. Move along. [scoffs] [somber music playing] [Carmen] Guia, we're going to buy your laptop. Where do you want to eat? Do you want to watch a movie? [Guia] Up to you, Mama. [Carmen] This one looks good on you! [Guia] Why do I need to wear this now? We just bought it. So what? At least you see how it suits you. You know what? There are more shops out here. I'm sure a lot more will look good on you! I think you need a new hairstyle. Come on! Really? Auntie won't approve of it. Let me deal with her. You don't have to look like an old maid like her! Come on, Guia. Let's go! [giggles] [birds chirping] [stylist] Here you go, ma'am! Your daughter looks really pretty! She doesn't look like an old maid anymore. I told you I'd make her beautiful! [Carmen] Perfect! My daughter looks beautiful! [giggles] [Carmen] Guia, what is it? Oh no! We should've done a skin test first. She seems allergic to your hair treatment! [stylist] Ma'am, I used organic products on her because you said it was her first time. Give me a minute. I'll just check on our products. Okay. Thanks. -You have a rash. -What? [Carmen] Don't scratch it! It may worsen. You seem to know Guia very well. You two seem to be very close. Am I right? Miss, I think because… we both grew up in the province that's why we bonded easily. So, there. Are you planning to court Guia? [clears throat] I'm… I'm sorry? I said, are you planning to court Guia? [tense music playing] [heavy breathing] I'm sorry. [heavy breathing] [sudden musical sting] If you have other plans aside from befriending her, don't even think about it. You will regret it. [gasping] [strange music playing] [sudden musical sting] Are you waiting for someone? You've been parked here since this afternoon. Miss, I'm sorry. I thought I fell asleep inside your house. Huh? What are you talking about? I don't know you. I don't allow strangers inside my house. Who are you, anyway? Why are you parked here? Miss, I'm Guia's friend. Guia is not here. I don't know what time she'll be back. Thank you! What do you like? Rice or pasta? Uh… [eerie ghostly music playing] [sighs] [sighs] [Carmen] Guia? Guia. Are you okay? Guia? Uh. Yes. -I'll just go to the restroom. -Okay. [exhales] [sighs, exhales] -[electricity sizzling] -[gasps] -[sudden musical sting] -[gasps] [heavy breathing] [screaming] [eerie music playing] -[panicked breathing] -[unsettling music playing] Guia! What's going on? What happened? Are you okay? Why are your hands so cold? [sobbing] [loud thud] [eerie ghost voice in the background] -[sudden musical sting] -[gasps] [car honking, tires screeching] [Renz speaks English] Sorry. [tense music playing] [breathing heavily] -[Carmen] Did you have fun? -I did! The food was amazing! -I am so full! -[giggling] -[Carmen] Luna! -[gasping] -[Luna] Why is your hair like that? -Auntie, it hurts. You look like a boy! You look so ugly! -It hurts! -Look at you! Change your clothes! Change your clothes! Luna! Stop it! What is your problem? She shouldn't cut her hair! She should've asked me first! Don't blame her. It's my fault! I told her to change her hairstyle! What's the big deal? It's just a change in hairstyle! It is a big deal! Because I raised her! Who's been taking care of her? Wasn't it me? Whenever she's sick, I'm there! I took her to the doctor! To school! And at home! It is I, not you! -Me! -[nervous breathing] -[tense music playing] -[nervous breathing] [unsettling music playing] [door creaking] [dramatic music playing] [sinister music playing] [thud] Luna? Luna? Luna? Luna? Luna? Luna? -[sudden musical sting] -[gasping] [shouts, groaning] [gasping] [eerie voice in the background] [groaning] [Carmen] Luna. Believe me. I know what I saw! We need to move out of this house. I have a bad feeling in here. It's just your imagination. Your mind is playing tricks on you. [sinister music playing] [ominous music playing] [shutter clicking] [shutter clicking] [sudden musical sting] [tense music playing] [panicked breathing] [somber music playing] Luna? Luna? [sobbing] Luna! What happened? Why did you do that? He cheated on me, Carmen. [Luna] He told me I'm the only one. I saw him with another girl. He was kissing her. He was kissing her! He's a cheater! He cheated on me! He's a liar! I'll have my revenge. I'll have my revenge, Carmen. I'll have my revenge. [chanting] [eerie music playing] [sobbing] [sizzling] [screaming] [sobbing] [screaming] [screaming] Ruben! [sobbing] [sobbing] [nervous breathing] [breathing heavily] Luna! [muffled screaming] [sobbing] [strange music playing] -[girl 1] Is that Guia? -[girl 2] She looks pretty. -[girl 1] She looks good. -Guia. Guia? Is that you? You're so beautiful. You're still wearing it. [chuckling] Good day! Take your pick! [in English] Choose your wild! [laughs] -Are you Apo Digos? -[sighs] I am Carmen. The grandchild of Amang Kabes. He's the great healer. Feared by many sorcerers. Because he is a very powerful sorcerer. What can I do for you? [Renz] Let's go! Over here! Over here! Look! [chuckles] Let's go! [chuckles] One of Amang Kabes' grandchildren has inherited the curse. She still continues doing sorcery. Is that you? No. I refused to be one. I never wanted it. My cousin Luna. One of Amang Kabes' grandchildren is one of his children. She's the one who embraced it. [unsettling music playing] I know Luna. [Apo] I was there when she was branded. Is she malevolent? Has she killed anyone? Did she hurt you? It's becoming clearer to me now. She continued doing sorcery. My greatest mistake was leaving my daughter in her care while I was working abroad. [Guia and Renz laughing] -Oh! You're good! -[laughs] That's it! I'll reload for credits. I'll get back at you. -Reload this, please. Two hundred. -Okay, sir. [sighs] [in English] Excuse me, sir. -Thank you. -Renz? -Oh! -Renz! Mylene! Hey! -[Renz] Hi! -[Mylene] How are you? -It's been a while! -Yeah. You look so good! -Thank you. -Do you still study political science? Shifted from Political Science to Economics. You've changed. [sighs] Guia! Apo Digos, I'm scared. She'll influence my daughter. To join the Coven. How can I keep her away from my daughter? You and your daughter should leave! Take her away from Luna. What if she still haunts us? Apo Digos. Please help us. You're a very good healer. You're the only one who knows how to stop Luna! I can put an end to Luna's powers if she hasn't been taken by a Mamalarang. Mamalarang? [Apo] Mamalarang is a powerful black entity that manipulates sorcerers. It can take any form or use any sorcerer who's willing to embrace it. [gasps] But if the Mamalarang has already taken over Luna, -it will be very difficult to stop it. -[gasping] I told you not to trust anyone! They will only fool you! Hurt you! They will take advantage of you! They're all alike. Cheaters! Apo Digos. [sobbing] I beg you. Save my daughter! I can't let Luna have her! Not Guia! Not my daughter! She has to kill me first before that happens! Shh. Take it easy. As long as your daughter is resisting her and she's not yet letting Luna in, we have a chance. Do not worry too much. Just pray. Guia. [sudden musical sting] Are you packing Guia's things? Are you two leaving? I thought you already stopped. After you had your revenge on the man who cheated on you, you promised you would stop being a sorcerer. Yes. I already know it. I remember everything. Why should I let go of the power that we have inherited from our ancestors? Don't you dare act like you're innocent! You're the only one who took this curse! Not me! Curse? This is not a curse! This is power! Power that I can use against hurtful people! And evil men! Power? Power given to you by the devil! Not by God! So please stop this. Spare me and my daughter from all this! The curse has ended with you. It's not with me. And not with Guia. We are not sorceresses. What if I tell you that Guia will inherit everything that you don't want? No. She won't be like you. She doesn't need this curse! Too late for that! She is mine. She is ours. I was the one who raised her, wasn't I? That makes me her mother now. Remember that! So you will leave without Guia. I will not leave this place without my daughter! Luna! [panicked breathing] Leave us alone! If you don't go, we will! [unsettling music playing] [sobbing] [gasps] [screaming] [sobbing] [screaming] [sobbing] [chanting in background] [nervous breathing] [chanting in background] [screams in pain] [screams in pain] Luna! [Carmen moans] [pained breathing] It hurts! Luna! [sobbing] Luna! [pained sobbing] -[eerie ghost voice in background] -[gasping] [eerie ghost voice continues] [Carmen sobs] [sobbing] [crying in pain] [cracking] [Carmen sobbing] [dramatic music playing] -[cracking] -[screams in pain] [sudden musical sting] [eerie ghost voice chanting] [cracking] [screams in pain] [cracking] [footsteps approaching] [gasping] [gasping] [sudden musical sting] [Renz] Guia, Mylene is my ex. I'm sorry if I didn't introduce you to her. She's just my ex. Guia, I'm sorry. Don't be mad. -[Guia] Mama? Renz, stop the car! -[tires screech] [gasping] Guia! Why? What happened? I saw Mama! Right here! Huh? Wait, hold on Where did you see your mom? I saw her right here! She was standing right here. [Renz sighs] -[phone ringing] -[Renz gasps] Hello, Auntie. Guia, your mother… [somber music playing] [melancholic music playing] I'm still here. I'm not going anywhere. I won't leave you. I'll always be by your side. I love you so much, my child. [sighs] I'll just talk to our relatives over there, alright? Condolences, Luna. [sobbing] [sighs] [eerie music playing] [sudden musical sting] Mm? [Guia] Where's my bracelet. [Guia sobs] [melancholic music playing] [sobbing] [phone vibrating] Hello? [Apo] Hello, Guia. Who is this? This is Apo Digos. Your mother asked me to reach out to you. I need to talk to you before it's too late. Guia. Your mother wants you to leave that house and never see your Auntie Luna ever again. [Guia] That's not easy. She's the one who looked after me. She's like a mother to me. In that case, you should be ready to receive something that your mother doesn't want you to have. I don't understand you. Are you ready to be a sorceress? [Apo] Guia. Your Auntie Luna wants you to be like her. [Guia gasps] [Apo] Never let her use you! Don't go back to Maupay. Read this carefully. You'll learn everything about sorcery. Only then will you understand what your mother wants. [gasps] This will ward off sorcerers' power. The holy oil, the Lana. As long as you're under your auntie's care, she will not stop, Guia. One day, you will wake up and the evil spirit Luna will have possessed you. -[Luna] Did your mother teach you… -[gasps] …to meddle with my things? [intense music playing] [gasping] Oh. What happened to you? -Stay away! -Huh? You are not Auntie Luna. You're a sorceress! What are you talking about? You killed my mother! -Me? -[Guia sobs] [gasping] [chanting in the background] [creaking] [footsteps approaching] [gasps] Guia. Forgive me. [screams and moans] [Guia sobs] Didn't I tell you that you and I are together in this? I am the only one who can protect you. Not your mother. Not anyone else! Only me! [sudden musical sting] [eerie ghost voice chanting] [chanting swells] [screams in pain] -[chanting stops] [chanting resumes] [Guia moans] [chanting swells] -[Luna grunts] -[Guia groans] Receive the power! If you join us, no one can ever hurt you. Nobody! Forever! [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [in demonic voice] Stop fighting it. You can't walk away from your destiny! You are the chosen one! [Guia] No, Auntie! I choose my own destiny. Not you. [dark music playing] [whimpering] No! [chanting] -No! -[chanting continues] Guia! [chanting continues] No, no, no…! [Luna whimpering] No… Guia… [screaming] No! [screaming in pain] [screaming continues] [music intensifying] [sobbing] Guia. Don't you love me? [whimpering] -I love you so much, Guia! -[sobbing] I love you! Guia! Guia! Guia! -[screaming] -[gasping] [gasping] [intense music playing] [sobbing] Mama? Dear? [breathing heavily] [whimpers] -Guia. -[sobbing] [delicate music playing] Stop it, Guia. [Renz] I'm here. [darkly delicate music plays] [eerie ghostly exhaling] [chanting whispering] [chanting intensifies] [drumming and chanting grow louder] [screaming] [atmospheric music playing]
