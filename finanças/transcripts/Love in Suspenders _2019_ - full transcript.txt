Fine, then you vacate the place starting tonight. Tonight? Yes. What do you mean tonight, where am I supposed to sleep? Sleep over at your girlfriends. She is not... not my girlfriend.

Did something happen? Everythings OK, I just had a circuit shortage, and the electrician decided to replace all the wires, an e strong y insists t at do not stay at home tonight, and I thought that maybe, who knows...

Forget about running me over at the parking lot, forget about causing shortage all over the house, all I am asking is that you please go home. Get some rest. Youve had a hard day. Have some rest, because you need it. You say that to make me feel bad. I say that to save you from having scruples. You were walking down the street, talking in your cellphone, passing by my car without watching, and your kettle is broken. Yours, not mine. You are right. It's not your fault. Me, it is my fault. No doubt. You are coming to sleep at my place. Whats wrong with you? And dont build any thoughts in your head. It is only because you have nowhere to go for the night. Where do you live?

I dont believe that. I heard that Tami is living with a sex maniac. Forced to having sex with him every night. You dont say! is quite common that parents tell their kids what to do. But it is very unaccepted, that the kids tell their parents what to do. I think you better explain to your son, that your life, is yours. You are right. That Tami with that that leech!

So, if you have someone, I am very happy for you, but he cant live here without arranging it with the management. Tami, As you have just said, my life is my life. And dont worry about the apartment. Meanwhile I am having a guest, I hope this is allowed. No one is living in my apartment other than me. Are there any pension or savings which can be taken from him?

First my son, and now the whole building knows, all the people are talking. Talking about what? Gossip, Beno, about me. Could you believe that? Whos gossiping? People. Dont you see how everyone is looking at us? No. I cant take it anymore. The house manager, Arie, he told me he thinks we live together. Why is it his business? He says that there are rules, and it must be arranged. Hes afraid that people might complain. I see. Well, Tami you dont deserve to suffer because of me. So I I will be leaving. Beno, Lets wait until they organized the mess at your place, and meanwhile keep this discrete. Are you sure you want me to stay? Yes, I am sure. Yifat. Yes. Hi, dad, waiting for you downstairs.

You said something? -No, just talking to myself. -Oh, sorry. No, its just that I am going to speak with my mother, and it seems like things are going to explode. Me too, I am going to speak with my father, and he sometimes, is causing me so much trouble. Lucky he always has creative ways to escape troubles. Thank you. My mom got entangled with some crook, a thief that wants her money. scum of the earth people. -Unbelievable -Did you tell the police? No, I want to first talk with her. And well see how she responds, its not going to be easy. Of course. But whos going to protect her, if not her son Exactly. Right. Though I dont think that thats the way she sees it. Good luck. -Ive paid you, thanks. -Thank you. Thank you very much. -Hi. -Hello again. A woman alone in this place, she is an easy prey. Yes, and men could be real assholes. Be assertive with your mom. -Which floor? -Sixth. Me too. Bye. Hi. Beno, we have guests. Hi dad. I thought you were alone here. I understand that you were talking before about my father. If he is your father then yes, I was talking about him. Ah, great. What are you talking about? About him. You dont talk like this about my dad. Michael. What is happening here? Whats happening is that this man, is a crook that all he wants is your money. Excuse me? Michael, apologize, apologize right now! Mom, do me a favor, you dont know him, but I do. You know him? You dont say! Shame on you! Well, excuse me, but I dont like this scene. Lets go. Beno No, No, mom, Im begging you. Stop this carnival and listen to all I got to say. Why wont everybody listen? Talk. Sorry, sorry, this time I am not leaving until I speak with my mother in private. Dad, lets go before I smash him right onto the window, OK? Idiot, he thinks that because he is rich, he deserves it all. Lets go, father. Idiot. Complete idiot. Mom I apologize for what has happened here. Do apologize, you have to apologize. But its all out of caring. What would you prefer? That I wouldnt care? That man, Beno. His name is Beno. That Beno, Is buried in debts up to his neck. He lives in a shithole, hasnt paid rent for years, he is going to be evacuated, in a few days hell be in the streets. There are many people having debt problems. It doesnt say that they are crooks. Perhaps this is related to Michael, What? I want to ask you a question. Go ahead. Are you worried about your inheritance? Is that what you think? What you really think? Maybe all this is because I love you? Have you thought about that? This man has a criminal record. A criminal record? Doesnt it look odd, that he fell under the wheels of your car and all that happened is that he just bent his ankle? He tricked you. And the electricity in his place Give me a break! Really! Played a game on you. I just over-heard his daughter downstairs, saying how how her dad knows how to escape problems with his creativity. She probably counts on that her father, that pauper, has found a rich woman to provide for him. And provide for her too, on the way, if possible. They were both playing a game on you. And the check? The check, the check that you gave him. He is beginning to milk you. But it was a check for some poor child, for his Bar Mitsva, Oy, mommy, mommy you are so naaive How cant you see we are talking about two crooks? Mom. You deserve more than that man. I told you it wasnt a match. Most important is that you are back. I missed you, Tami. Come, come. Rest. Rest. Yoni Look here, I wrote a very strong letter for you. You take it, submit it to the clerk you spoke with, and thats all. Just give it to him, nothing else. What has happened? There is no how are you today ? -No how are you today. -Why, what happened? I am back home. Electricity is back? Back. So, everything is good then. Everything is good. All is good. Well, as I said, you give him this, and thank-you-very-much. Hi? I just want to know why. Why what? Why after all that happened, you never called? I thought about calling, but you didnt. Neither did you. Tami. I am not a baby. Your son was standing here, calling me a crook. You heard that, but you didnt respond. And until this day, I havent heard what your opinion is. Michel, eh He has a friend a detective. Detective? Yes, and he told him things. What did he tell him? That you have big debts. True. That you dont pay rent and you have a criminal record. What? Michael thinks that you are with me for the money. And what do you think? I am confused. Confused? Tami, you you are the biggest disappointment I have ever had in my whole life. I just said that You have said enough. And now I want to make it easy for you. That crook, you are not going to see anymore. Beno. Give ear, O heavens, and let the earth hear the words May my teaching drop like the rain, my speech condense like the dew For I will proclaim the name ascribe greatness to our God! Mazal Tov (Hebrew: congratulations, good luck) A man once visited the doctor saying he wants to lower his sexual potency, the doctor looks at him and says, mister, at you age, its all in your head.

We went on with the adult groups move on Dad, what is all this? Why are all your things out? Its Hershkovic. No, no, guys, here, here. Great. Great. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? Hello, Beno. What I should have done long ago. What kind of a human being are you, tell me. Tell me, do you have court order? Court order my ass. Here, here. Hershkovic, without a court order you cannot vacate me, you gangster! Why are you doing this, Moishe? Arent you ashamed? Shosh, you keep quiet. You too are on target, havent paid this month. Fine, without court order I am getting back home and thats it. Theres nothing to get back to. I replaced the lock. Besides, I want to remind you, that this is not your building, it is my building.

Quick. Fast, turn to channel ten. Ten. The Hose with Guy Lehrer Good night, we are The Hose and in live broadcast as usual, and we want to begin with another victim of the housing crisis, Benjamin Beno Teznik, Beno was taken into custody today after smashing the car headlights of the owner of the building where he has lived. After kicking him out to the street as result of delay in paying rent. Beno became known during the 80s, when, due to his wifes cancer, being denied lifesaving medication, he hunger stroke before the parliament building, leading a protest followed by his arrest. Thanks to his action, the drug was added to the health plan, saving hundreds of lives, unfortunately, for Benos wife, that was too late and she died. People who know Beno join us and tell about him, lets hear. What shall I say? Benos wife Zehava, of blessed memory, was ill for nine years. Nine years! Beno took loans from the bank, for the treatments, for medication, his house too. My dad is not a criminal. He is seventy, still working, all his life he provided for the family as well as for himself, even helping people with work, and now he has no money and he reached the bottom, but for sure he is not a thief and surely not a crook! They threw my grandfather out of his home because of not paying rent. All his belongings are here in the street. And they took him handcuffed. My grandfather is a hero, not a criminal! He is a good man! I really love him. Please help him, please! Yes, and after such heart-touching words by Benos granddaughter, the web is boiling high. I presume that within a short while bail money will be raised. For our new hero. Until then, seems like Beno is going to spend the night in custody. Yes, yes. Fine, I'll talk to you during the night. Hello. Yes? I want to pay bail, to release Benjamin Reznik. That poor guy, from the television. Whats your name? Tami Baram. How are you related to him? A friend. Would you also like to see him? Eh No No. Just pay. Give me an ID. Yoni? Yoni, I know you are here. I must speak with you. Yoni, you are the love of my life. But you are there and I am still here. I dont know what to do. Tami, my love. Simply, this is my time to leave. And your time to move on. Havent I missed the train? Not at all! The contrary. This is the time to rise, fly, celebrate. My sweetheart eh, I came to say thank you. And return your money. For bailing me out. No, no. Keep it, until things get better. Everything is fine now. You wont believe, after that article on TV, how many donations I received. It is unbelievable. First of all, it calmed my bank manager a little. Second, I now have several months breathing time without worrying about the rent. Thank you very much. OK. Before I quit, I think your son was right. When he said that we come from two different worlds. And that we are not meant together. And I think, that you too were right. By breaking up with me. Thats it. Beno, have you felt anything about me? Not at all, I just came to take advantage of you. I want to know If you really want to know, then I think that I wouldnt be able to live with a woman, whom I clearly love, that doesnt believe me. And I wouldnt live with someone so closed, so not telling me about what happened in his life, taking multi-vitamin, in order to make love to me. Then eh there is nothing we can do. No, nothing we can do. Thank you, thank you for coming. Did you enjoy? Very much, a lot So charming. Mazal Tov. Last dance? I hope you all enjoy yourselves. -I also hope that you like the food, -Beno, your wife is in seventh heaven. May I invite the bride for the first dance?
