- Come in. - Merci. - Glad to see you. - Thank you sir. I haven't much time so... - suppose we get busy. - Right. We've succeeded in getting the plans of the floors, above and below. Also the layout of the corridors and the adjoining building. - Satisfactory? - I think that covers everything. You've drawn a tough assignment this time old man. And if you're caught, you'd probably will be a... Sort of a man without a country. - Well, let us say a man without a job. - Or both. You have enjoyed your trip monsieur? Yes? - I'm overwhelmed. - It's too bad it must end so soon. - Meaning what? - I've here a wireless from Paris. I'm instructed before docking at New York... to transfer you to the steamship Patricia leaving for Cherbourg today. You are to be returned to France for further investigations. And, if you have enjoyed your trip on this ship monsieur... wait till you're aboard the Patricia. - You mean I'm not even going to land? - That is correct monsieur. Who says so? The Republic of France. I will read you my instructions. To Captain Honore LeFarge, steamship San Nochelle. Before docking port of New York deliver deported alien Donald Free into... custody of Captain Paul Duval's steamship Patricia... It must be getting awfully late dear. But it won't take us long to drive back to town. Why, it can't be more than half past... Confound it, my watch has stopped. Never mind dear, I'll call the operator. It's disconnected. Just one more half hour please, we don't run any chances here. I wish we didn't have to go back, ever. What? What is it? - I don't know. - Open the door. If you don't open by the time I count three I'll break it in, one... You going to open up? Two... Three. Well Mrs. Wright, I've been tailing you for a long time. I told your husband that sooner or later I'd get the goods on you. - Well, we got them at last. - All alone in their nice little love nest. - Who are you? - Dan Hogan, private detective. - And this is my secretary. - And witness. Mrs. Wright's husband has been a client of mine for some time. I told him I'd deliver. And here you are alone at last. Did you say alone? Who the... Who are you? Well, that's rather a funny question after breaking my door down. Suppose you tell me who you are before I call the police? - You, your house? - Certainly. It hasn't suddenly become immoral for a man to rent a house, has it? Rent a house? You mean... I mean that Mrs. Wright came down here today to rent this beach house. This gentleman is my partner. I just stepped in there to make a little tea, when suddenly you break in. - Is he kidding? - Of course he's not kidding. What you mean kidding? Why Mrs. Wright had just handed my partner 65 dollars for her first month's rent. - But... - Show it to them. When suddenly you come breaking in. You see, there it is. Now she'll probably want to back out and I can't say that I blame her. It's a wonder you detectives wouldn't get a little horse sense. Say, by the way... How do I know that you are the detective? I'm Dan Hogan of the Peerless Detective Agency. That doesn't mean a thing. Anybody can get one of those. Well here, there's my license and here's my business card. Well, detective or no detective, that doesn't pay for my door. I think I'll call the police. Perhaps you haven't heard that it's... called illegal entry when you break into a house without a warrant. Hello? I want the police department. Hold on mister, hold on, you got me wrong, I didn't know this was your... Listen, I broke the door, alright. I'll pay for it, sure I'll pay for it. It'll cost 25 or 30 dollars to fix that door. Yeah, Ok, Ok. Just cancel that call. - Twenty, twenty five. - Thirty. Glad to, glad to, it was all a mistake, you know. You... That's all right, let's say no more about it. Now, if you don't mind... - Oh, sure, sure. - Come on. I'm very sorry. You know, one of these days you're going to get pinched for impersonating a detective. - Well, who are you? - I'm a lifesaver. Have a nice time. Say, just a minute, you have my hat and coat. But I saved your skin for you, didn't I? I received your application Mr. Free, I'm sorry I can't do anything for you. As all candidates for the detective force are selected from our regular uniformed ranks. I see. I'm sorry, we couldn't possibly engage a store detective without a number one record. Well, you see, I'm just back from abroad. You should've stayed there, over here practically nobody is working. The position of secretary had just been filled. Thank you. I paid $50 for it. I don't care if you paid 100. Five dollars, take it or leave it. I'll take it. - Oh, ouch. - Ouch yourself. - Did I hurt you? - You certainly didn't do me any good. I'm terribly sorry. - Ah Mr.Hogan? - No... Oh yes, that is... I'm Mr. Hogan's partner. Is it something I can do for you? Why, yes. Well, suppose you tell me about it. Won't you sit down? You see, I've never had the occasion to use the services of a private detective before. No, of course not. My partner is very busy, working on a case. - Well now. - Well... Well, certain stories have come to my ears concerning my wife. Up to a short time ago we were very, very happy and then... Well, perhaps you better see for yourself. What the hoot? So what's the idea? Who are you? You ask me? And you call yourself a detective? - I'm your new partner. - My partner? - Say, your face is familiar. - It ought to be, it's been around a lot. - What are you doing in my office? - Office? I thought this was your bedroom. I just told you, I'm your new partner. At least, say I ain't got enough business to share with a house fly. When I get through here you'll have so much business you'll have to incorporate. Money. Believe it or not, it is money. Say, it's so long since I've seen any money I forget whether you eat it or eat with it. Until you and I have a little understanding you don't do anything with it. Now get this. You got a license to be a private detective, haven't you? But you haven't any clients. Well, I've a client but I haven't any license. - Well? - Well... Am I your partner or do I take my business elsewhere? - You really got a client, eh? - Look. Ok, we go in together. Now what's the case? Get a load of this. This woman's husband is president of the Columbus National Bank. He wants to know where she spends her time while he's in conference. Say, this is right in my lap, I'll handle this case personally. That's fine. I was afraid you might turn it over to one of your staff. Oh, that's my new, my new partner. - I might've known it. - Known what? That you were a detective the minute you stepped on my feet. - Is Amy Moran, my secretary. - Sure, secretary. He ain't got anything to do and I see to it that he don't forget anything. Hey, what is that look like to you? - Cigar coupons. - No, that happens to be money. Oh yeah? Well, I wouldn't know about that. Well, make yourself comfortable. I got a lot of work to do. Boy, this is some job, this is. Say, how about a twenty for expenses? You know, I'm still wondering where I've seen you. Suppose you put that under the head of homework. - Right now you got a case to handle. - Right. Atlantic City, next stop. Just as easy as that. They registered here at the Continental Hotel as man and wife... and just went upstairs a couple of minutes ago. - You're amazing Hogan, positively amazing. - I got to have you down here as a witness. Certainly it's important. A raid like this isn't any good without witnesses. Well, I had figured on being busy tonight but... business before business. You ought to carry a horn too. Telegram please. - Always right. - What do you mean? - You can't come in here... - Nothing at all ma'am, nothing at all. - We got everything we want, ain't we? - What do you mean? Now, just keep cool, calm and collected. What's the idea? Oh, it's you? Yes. I'm afraid my partner has made a slight mistake. Mistake, what do you mean mistake? Ain't this Mrs. Burns? Sure this is Mrs. Burns. Now shake hands with her husband. That's a nice girl. Sonny... I don't want to have all the fun. Why don't you play with him for a while? I don't suppose you by any chance you remembered to buy the tickets back to town? I got one ticket, alright. - One ticket, eh? - Sure, how many do you think I need? Detective? The only claim you got to being a detective is you've got big feet and they're flat. Say, for the last time I'm telling you... Who ever heard of a man going to Atlantic City with his wife? Were you ever married? - I was once, why? - Where you go for your honeymoon? Atlantic City. - Tickets please. - Look at that rain. You ain't going to blame me for that too, are you? Tickets please. Tickets. Ticket? Say, what is this? A detective agency or a dog pound? Next time you forget your manners I'm going to sock you. What's the idea of this dog stealing business anyway? Well, we got to eat, don't we? Can you think of a better way? - Than stealing dogs? - What do you mean stealing? Can I help it if a dog follows me and his owner offers a reward for his return? All I got to say is we've either got to get a new racket or a new rug. It'll be a new both. I got a guy coming here in a little while... that's got every racket in this town in his vest pocket. We going to get together. And in six months we'll be turning down more money than the mint can turn out. - Who is he? - Tony Bandor. - The gambler? - Right. I'm going to make a deal with him that'll have us riding around in his panasouzas. Or his pana patrol wagon. Peerless Detective Agency. Who? Mr. Hogan isn't back yet. Peerless Detective Agency. Who do you want? Mr. Free? He isn't in. Would you like to leave your name? Betty, Get off without your letter and bring me those photostatic checkered papers, will you? And put that in file 16. Tell Mr. Free I got the dope for that Wilson case. Where's the evidence on that Philly case? Here it is. - No, I mean that bedroom picture. - I get it. - Here's the one of the Watkins's divorce. - Yeah, that's it. - And the Norris Harbaum case. - Just put that on Love Nest on Long Island. - Is the boss in? - No. It's alright, I'll wait for him. Listen fashion plate, didn't the boss tell you he didn't want you hanging around here? I'll keep quiet, what's the matter Amy? You're covering up a lot of expensive scenery. This is strictly class joint now and the boss don't want you around. I need some dough. My, my. Have you tried writing to your congressman? Oh, shut up. Come on now, go places. I haven't got any money. I got to have some money, that's all. Oh, yeah? Well that's my trouble too, maybe we're related. Say, you're the guy I'm looking for. I got a job for you. Why, sure boss. - Free in? - Yes. - Hello Hank. - Hello Hogan. Mr. Bandor is waiting for you in your office. Ok. Hello Tony. - Hello big shot, how are you? - Bigger and better than ever. Hey, you look like you had something on your mind. Yeah, I have. Well, keep your seat, let's have it. - Men are so deceitful. - Yes, aren't they? Oh, well... Goodbye Mr. Free and thank you so much. Alright, who is next? Mr. Mandelbaum, manager of the Jefferson Hotel. Oh yes. - Name is Reynolds, eh? - Yeah, that's right. She's been coming to my place for a long time now. Lately she started winning every night, it's three grand or four grand or five grand even. And I've tried cold-decking or tilting the wheel but she cleans up anyway. Well, now she's in to me for 45 grand. - Well, what's 45.000 to you? - No more than 22.500 is to you. What do you mean? Well, I mean partners split losses as well as winnings, don't they? Keep quiet, will you? What's the matter, ain't you cutting Free in on this sideline with me? What he don't know won't hurt him. - Besides, he's got what he calls ethics. - Ethics? In a racket like this? Now don't worry Mr.Mandelbaum, we'll have the dope on her in no time. I thank you very much for your kind advice sir. - Good day. - Good day. - Say, I got a special job for you. - That's exciting. But it's too important just to give to one of the boys. - Whose home do we bust up this time? - That Follies dame is here for you again. Mr. Free doesn't want to be disturbed for a few minutes. Oh, alright. Say, listen to this. There's a dame in this town that we got to get something on in a hurry.. She's got to get in trouble, get it? But I mean first class, a number one trouble that'll be hard to get out of. But you mean that you want me to... Hey, I don't go in for that. Give to anything you like but get her in bad. She's society, see and important. And there's a ten grand fee in it for us. Ten grand? She's got all kinds of money and plenty of nerve. Her name is Janet Reynolds. You can pick her up over Tony Bandor's place almost any night. - Bandor's? - It's a rush job. I'd hop to it. Well, for 10.000 bucks I suppose is no harm in taking a look at it. Attaboy. - Hey, where are you going? - I'm going to see the second act. Wait a minute, what do you think this is? A theater? You can't kid me, I got a pass I'll check, see? Listen, if you don't get out of here I'll pass you out, you understand that? - You can't put me out. - Oh, no? Now you get out of here, hold that umbrella, will you? Doorman, doorman. - You mean me? - Certainly. - Aren't you going to bring me that umbrella? - Oh, umbrella. Why didn't you say so? Keeping me waiting in the rain like that. How can you be such an idiot? Perfectly simple madam, I do it without half trying. Thank you mister. Oh, why? You aren't the... - Are you? - No. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I'm so glad. How stupid of me to make such a silly mistake. Not at all, you compliment my performance as a doorman. - Good evening Miss Reynolds. - Good evening. - But it was terribly nice of you. - Sometimes I'm just naturally nice. I believe it. Because you say so yourself in such an assured way. You know what they say about self confidence. But I don't, what do they say about self confidence? Why, that... Well, it seems to skip my mind. Perhaps a drink will revive my memory, will you join me? Well, since you're so naturally nice. - Champagne cocktail. - Make it two. Yes sir. You come here often? I'm afraid they think I come here too often. - I've been rather lucky. - Are you lucky? I'm beginning to think so. - After all, this is rather unique. - What? Finding you here alone. I don't see why, I like to gamble, that's all. Still that's no reason for doing alone. I like to sit in a warm tub too. Does that call for company? - You win. - Perhaps I'm an orphan. Can an orphan afford to gamble? - Well, maybe I've solved a pittance. - You won't have it long at roulette. Listen pessimist, I started here a few weeks ago with 1.000 dollars worth of chips. And you still able to pay your subway fare? After three and a half weeks of play, house now owes me $45.000. Forty five thousand? Charles, bring an aspirin. Number ten black, even number. - I wish I had luck like that. - Let's try another one. Place your bets down ladies and gentlemen. - She's won 3.000 up to now. - All down. Number eight black, even number. Pardon, but just what system do you use? You win so consistently. I just pick a number and bet on it. Then when it wins, I collect. - But, but if it loses? - I don't select that kind of a number. How you feeling? - You did rather well this evening. - Yes, I won $4.200. You've practically reduced roulette to a science. Oh no, it's just luck. - Almost 50.000 dollars worth. - I love it. - The money? - Oh no, of course not. Just the thrill. Suppose you were held up some evening on your way home? I think I'd rather enjoy that, but not much chance of happening. - You're a heavy winner. - Yes, but I always let my winnings ride. - Are there no villains lurking in your life? - Not a villain. It's too bad, I was hoping I might apply for a position as your bodyguard. Oh, that is too bad. But I'm afraid I shan't need one. - Quite sure? - Quite. - You're very unique. - Oh, we're nearly home. What you going to say? - I'm afraid it was rather trite. - Go on, say it. Take a chance. Well... I was going to say that I think you're lovely. Well, why don't you say it? I will. I think you're lovely. I don't think that's so very trite. Then what? When I woke up I found myself alone in a hotel room with this man. I see. Don't you worry Mrs. White, I'll straighten this out for you. Thank you. You mind leaving your telephone number with my secretary? Why not? Come along Mrs. White. You dirty rat. But Hogan told me the only way to haul her was to feed her knock-out drops. I don't care what he told you, we're not using those methods. The next time I'll break your thick skull. Get out. Screw. He's not the only one around here I'd like to see get chucked out in his ears. It's nice clean business Amy. Framing innocent women whose husbands are tired of them. Taking children from their mothers, shaming their fathers. Look, divorce. Raid, raid, divorce. Jeffrey's children awarded to their father. Wilson's little boy placed in a children's home. Takes a whole crew to wreck a house, but boy, how one man wreck a home. Taking cash for being a licensed Peeping Tom. You're telling me? What I do with this? - As far as I'm concerned you can... - Oh Mr. Free please. What are you kicking about? We got every divorce lawyer in town using our outfit now. We've muscled in on a dozen different rackets and our payment... overdue is as fast as a mint can make it. Now what are you kicking about? You wouldn't understand if I told you. We're doing business. But there's nothing in our partnership that says that I have to like it. Say, by the way. How did you happen to hear about what we were talking just now? Oh, what you mean? I mean that you may be a very good private detective... but you're no mind reader. Come here a minute. I thought so. Dictaphone, eh? But Don, I got to keep everything covered around here. I just overheard you by accident. From now on, suppose you say that to your clients? You want to know what's on my mind, just come and ask me, I'll tell you. - But Don, for the love of... - And one thing more. I want to know who's offering 10 grand to frame that Reynolds girl. As long as you're getting your split, what do you care? - I think this is one case we ought to drop. - Drop a 10 grand fee? You're crazy. I got a date at the racetrack, I'm late already. - Oh, Don, you embarrass me. - Why? You keep decorating me with orchids, I'll think you're robbing a greenhouse. Cocktail? You keep decorating me with cocktails I'll think you're hijacking a rum run. Oh silly please sit down. - Well, may your rum runner keep running. - And may your greenhouse keep greening. We have some glorious fun, haven't we? - Despite a rather damp beginning. - I'll never complain about the rain again. Oh, Don, I hope you don't mind, I invited an old friend of mine to dinner with us. She just had divorce and she is all alone. - We'll give her a cheer. - Excuse me. - Miss Reynolds is in, isn't she? - Yes ma'am, she's in the living room. Thanks. - Hello darling, I'm so glad to see you. - Hello. Oh, I'm so sorry be late. That's all right. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Helen, this is Mr. Free. Don Mrs. Burns. - A friend of yours? - Yes. Why, this man is a detective. - Detective? - Of course. He's a private detective. In all probability he's spying on you just as he spied on me. Friend of yours. Why, don't you see? That's the way he works, pretending to be a friend. - Janet. - Can you deny it? What she says is true. - But believe me when I tell you that... - Oh, my dear, I'm glad I came. Perhaps I can stop him from whatever he's trying to do to you. Don... Is this true? I, I can't believe it. - Yes Janet, I am a private detective. - But, why are you spying on me? Haven't you anything to say? I'm afraid not. That's number five. Say, how many can you stand anyway? How many have you got? Hey, zig boy... Ma'am? Did anybody ever tell you you've the nicest eyes? Yes, wrong people always do. - Hey, come here, what's the matter with you? - You're sorry. Say, I've been in every speak in town looking for you. - Too bad, you should come here first. - But what in the world you've been doing? Say listen, if you don't go to work on this Reynolds dame... we're going to be up the crick. We got to give our client a little action for his 10 grand or is going to be just too bad. - For whom? - For both of us. - For you maybe, but not for me. - What you mean? You're my partner. You got your tenses slightly mixed, I was your partner. - Hey, what's the idea? - Well, I'm through, you get me? I'm finished, washed up. Furthermore, from now on I want you to lay off that Reynolds girl. You're crazy, what do you mean lay off? That dame means dough, You lay off or you won't have any use for dough. Why? Oh, what's up? - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. What you've done about that Reynolds girl? Oh, I had tough luck, the man I had on the job quit. - Why, what's happened? - What's happened? I'm in a spot, that's what happened. I told you you got to work fast and now look. Why, what's wrong? She just phoned me she's going to Europe tomorrow night. - Europe? - And she wants her dough. And now you, you were going to fix everything. Now is the payoff and nothing is been paid. - She's going to Europe? - You heard me, Europe. Tomorrow night. And that ain't all, she's coming to the office tonight at 11:30 to collect. - Now what we going to do? - Well, what's the rush about Europe? You ask me riddles. I'm asking you. If I don't pay up and it gets around that I'm welshing I'm going to lose my clientele. You had a month to get something on that dame and what do you do? Nothing, nothing. And I set you up, didn't I? I put you here with this fancy furniture and the... soft racket and now you pull a flop on me. Hold on, wait a minute, who's pulling a flop? I got it, I got an idea, I got a whale of an idea. You say she'll be at your office at 11:30? - Yeah. - That's great. Now all you got to do is put off paying until tomorrow. Now listen to this... You be down at the joint in half an hour, it's exactly 9 o'clock now. I'm telling you, I don't keep that much cash here. There you are. There ain't over 8 grand there altogether so how can I pay you fifty on the spot? I telephoned Sam this afternoon. That should've been plenty of time. I'm sailing tomorrow night and I'm sailing with my money. Of course, of course, sure you are Miss Reynolds. Only it ain't reasonable to expect to just walk in... and find that much money laying around in the safe. Either that I haven't got the dough, just that I don't keep it all here, that's all. Suppose there's a raid, what happens? Think of my dough, don't you understand? All right, I'll be reasonable. I sail tomorrow night. - It's your move. - Ok, now look. You come to this address tomorrow at 2 o'clock, say. Mind that doesn't get around. I pay you off, you take your dough and that's that. Two o'clock tomorrow. - Two o'clock. - I'll, we'll be there. And now I'm going to see if I can't take you for a few thousand more. - Wish you luck. - Thank you. All down. 24, red, even number. Place your bets ladies and gentlemen. All down. 24 black, even number. You know? I see everything in this room but the thing I'm most interested in. - Yeah, what's that? - Your safe. I'm sailing tonight as I told you. - And while I don't want to seem unsociable. - Oh, I see. Doesn't a pretty woman ever think of anything but money? Certainly. Sometimes she thinks of the things it will buy. - Well? - Well what? Well, what about the payment? Wait a minute, anybody come here with you? No, at least if they did I didn't see them get out of the cab. - Good. - I keep my bargains. Yeah? So do I. Hold your horses a minute and I'll show you. Look. Aren't you tricky. Yeah, anytime they put anything over on Tony Bandor. Why you suppose I asked if anybody was here with you? Foxy. - Well, here you are. - Thank you. - How about a little receipt? - Certainly. I don't mean that kind of receipt. Oh, so it's going to be that kind of a party, is it? Sorry Tony, but I gamble for my money. I came here to be paid, not pawed. Listen baby, you think Tony Bandor is going to put out 50 grand for nothing? Now listen to me, I came here be paid, you hear me? And if you do so much as lay a hand on me... - Well, that's what I brought this for. - Oh, yeah? Tony, stop. I'll shoot. If you take another step, I'll shoot. You haven't got nerve enough. - Yeah, Hogan speaking. - Hello Danny? I just wanted to tell you that it worked. Yeah, I am now a ghost. Now listen, I'm all packed, see? Now what do I got to do? All I got to do is go to shy, isn't it? Hello? Hello? Going away Mr. Free? - You help me pack? - Sure enough. How long you going to be gone? - From now on. - You mean you're quitting? Yes. I don't blame you, I guess. But when you walk out of here every bit of decency goes with you. Thanks Amy. Sure wish I could go with you. Say, working around here I'm even beginning to look like a burglar. When I get settled somewhere would you like to work for me? For nothing. Well, the price is right. I don't know how it happened. - Who's in there? - Some dame. That's right, she asked for you when she came in. - For me? - Yes. - Don, I'm in terrible trouble. - Miss Reynolds has just shot Tony Bandor. Shot Bandor? I had to, I went to his place... He was going to pay me off and said that he didn't have that much money at the club. So he told me to come to his house at 2 o'clock today. Then he went to the safe and took out the money... and when I reached for it he went for me. I had to shoot him. Oh, Don, now what will happen? The usual thing, probably, unless we can think of some way out. Newspaper stories, jail. After all, Bandor was a big-shot racketeer. The police ought to write her a letter of thanks for getting him out of the way. Remember Miss Reynolds did not go to the club. She went to his house, alone. To collect a gambling debt. Even a hand-picked jury would be a little slow on sympathy in a case like this. I came right here to see you. And as you weren't here, I've been giving Miss Reynolds some advice. I don't think Miss Reynolds needs your advice. Janet, will you come here with me? Hold on, just a minute, you can't do that, I was handling this case. Was is right. Hello boss? Yeah, yeah, I got it. Yeah, you mean Free? Say. Ok, ok, boss, I'll be there. - What did you do with the gun? - The gun? Oh? Why, I dropped it in an ash can on the way out. - Well... - What you going to do? Let's see if we can't recover that gun and I'll have a look at the house, come on. There it is in the middle of the next block, right in front of that iron fence. Suppose you wait in this drugstore. I'll pull right up the house and pick you up in a few minutes. - You don't think I ought go with you? - No, you wait here. Just pull up in the middle of the next block. Right. - Wait for me here. - Right. Well? - What it be? - Oh, chocolate soda. He's dead alright. Didn't you tell me that he fell directly in front of the Chinese cabinet where the safe is? - Yes. - And that the money was just beside him? Yes, why? I think you better go straight home and wait there until you hear from me. But Don, shouldn't we notify the police? Let me handle this, detectives has his uses after all. Now don't worry, I'll call you a taxi. Listen I'm telling you, he ain't hopped up. He's dead, you understand, dead. Alright, I just want to be sure. Now listen to me, you beat it over to Valentini's, hear? Be seen talking to some of them mugs over there. Now, you got to set your alibi, so be careful. Just stay in circulation. And lay off that snow till this gets cold. - Get me? - Yeah. - But you got to stand by me now. - Hey you... I got important call to make, you going to be there all day? Ok boss. Crock. Well... I thought if I waited around here long enough you show up again. Did you take that run-out powder on me just now because you didn't like my face? - What do you mean? - Don't be as dumb as you look. I told you to wait for me down at the village about an hour ago, why didn't you? How I know you was coming back? I've been gypped like that before. Is that so? Well maybe you can tell me where you drove the guy that came out of that house. The one that was in such a rush that he couldn't wait to call a cab of his own. - I don't get you. - No? I'll say it in English this time. - I want to know where you drove that guy. - I don't remember. Let's take a little drive down to headquarters. Maybe it'll help you jazz up your memory. - Oh, a dick, eh? - Right. How I know you was a dick? Say, I don't want no trouble. He said he was in some kind of jam so I run him over to... - Frank Valentini's speak over on 3rd street. - What he look like? I didn't get much of a look, he was in a rush. Medium-sized guy, tough looking, and nervous, like a snowbird. Ok, let's get going to Valentini's. Hello Whitey. Hello. So what's the matter? You look as if you were seeing a ghost. - I don't feel so good. - Too bad. Funny I was thinking about you just today, wondering why I hadn't seen you around. Been out of town. I only got back a few minutes ago. Lucky I happened to run into you. - I want to have a little talk with you. - What you want to talk about? Let's go in the back room and sit down. They tell me that a 45 slug makes a hole about the size of a half dollar. A hole the size of a half dollar would let... quite a lot of air into your middle, wouldn't it Whitey? I told you ten times I don't know nothing from what you're talking about. Listen, you ain't got nothing on me, now lay off. I'm beginning to lose patience. If you don't open up pretty quick, I'm going to let you have it right under the table. I'll rip a hole in you big enough to drive a Ford through and I'm not playing. I'm going to give you the count of three and you get don't talk... - I swear, I swear, don't know what you mean. - You're yellow Whitey, yellow. That's why you missed when you put the finger on me over at Bandor's place. But I'm closer to you than you were to me. And I'll take what's left of you down to the morgue and... throw it on a cold wet slab with the other stiffs. And your dame will weep and tear her heart out... for a lug so dumb that he wouldn't talk when he had the chance. One... - two... - Quit it, will you? Put it away. I'll talk, honest I'll talk. I'm telling you I'll talk. - You better start because I'm in a hurry. - Alright, I did it. I did it alright but wasn't my idea. He called me just a few minutes before you come and he told me you was... coming and that I'd better let you have it good. Who told you? Hurry, will you? It may be Mr. Free. I'm Mr. Hogan, I got to see Miss Reynolds right away. - Come right in, I'll call her. - Oh Mr.Hogan... - Is something happened? - I'm afraid it has Miss Reynolds. Unfortunately you were seen leaving Bandor's place and by the wrong man. - What can be done? - Well, that's why I rushed over here. One of Bandor's mob, a guy named Bert Hess... was on his way to Bandor's when he saw you run out of the house. I only got the word an hour ago, I've just left him over at my office. Now we got to stop that guy from going to the police... and what's worse, from tipping off the rest of the mob. - But how? - That's the point, there's just one way. Cash and I don't mean petty cash... if the cops come for you, you'll face a prejudiced jury. If Bandor's mob comes for you, it'll be even worse. Now we got to pay that egg to hold his tongue. Of course pay him, pay anything he wants. He wants 25.000 dollars and he won't take $24.990. I'll do anything at all you say. Then we got to work fast, because he's given me just... 40 minutes to come up here and get the dough. - Will, will he take a check? - I'll make him. - How shall I make it out? - I wouldn't make it out all just yet. - Oh Don, I'm so glad you've come. - So am I. - Hiya Dan. - Why... - Why, I... - You seem surprised to see me. I was seen leaving Bandor's house by one of his men Mr.Hogan just talked to him. That's the reason you're writing out a check, eh? Suppose I drop by for that a little later on Miss Reynolds, I got an appointment. Say, I just heard a story that I think it'll interest you. Sit down, won't you? Take it easy Dan. I just heard this. St seems that a certain rather wealthy young woman in this town is... been visiting one of these gambling joints lately... where she won a lot of money, about 50.000 dollars. It seems the owner of the gambling house didn't want to pay up. So he arranged with a firm of private detectives to try to get something on her. So that in case he wanted to run out on her debt she couldn't squawk, you understand. But the detective agency wasn't able to get anything on her. And when the time came for the gambler to pay up... he and his detective friend cooked up a little scheme to frame the girl. They knew she carried a gun. So they managed to take the bullets out of it and load it with doctored shells. Then the gambler tricked the girl into a situation at his apartment. Where she had to take a shot at him. And she ran out of the place thinking she killed him. - Then he isn't dead? - Oh, yes. He's dead alright. - But, I don't understand. - I'm coming to that. It seems that in the meantime our detective... friend had hit upon a particularly bright idea. It dawned on him that he had a perfect setup for a beautiful double cross. That if he could put a real bullet between the gambler's ribs... just after the girl left the apartment... then the gambler would actually be out of the way... and mister detective could grab up all the money that was lying around loose... all the profits from the gambling rackets... and have the exclusive rights to blackmailing the girl for the rest of her life. You're crazy, you've been reading too many detective stories. - I didn't read this, I heard it. - Who told you that bunch of hooey? The same gentleman who's going to tell it to a jury. Whitey, tell him what you going to tell the jury. I'm going to tell them that a guy hired me to rub out Bandor and then get you. Our mastermind didn't have the courage to do his own shooting. He had to prey upon the weakness of a poor hop-head. Say... I rather anticipated that you would be traveling, so I... took the liberty of ordering you a limousine. Over there boys. - There's the detective we're after. - Hey, what's that? That's your exit march. - Your name Amy Potts? - Yeah, what about it? Here, a little present for you. What's this? It's an invitation to a big party. In other words, a subpoena. A subpoena? For me? For what? Your old boss Mr. Dan Hogan is on trial for murder and a few other little minor offenses. Yeah, I know it, but what's that got to do with me? They want you for a character witness. The State figures you can help hang him. It's a pleasure. - I just received your message Don. - Well, I'm going back to my first love. I've been reinstated, I'm sailing tomorrow. - Are you really going? - See I... Well, I suppose I'm just an adventurer at heart. I like the life. Travel, foreign lands, intrigue. And frequently as not, trouble. It must be a very lonely life. It's not exactly the sort of life I would ask anyone to share with me. I see. So, I suppose this is goodbye Janet. Perhaps we run across each other again some time. Goodbye. Goodbye Don. Don. Oh, Don. Don. Do they let you have wives in the diplomatic service? - Are you by any chance proposing to me? - And you're supposed to be a detective.
