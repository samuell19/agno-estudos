Yeah, you know what's coming up, don't ya? Hang on a minute. Hang on. I've gotta mix it up. That's it. Yeah. You're a good fella today. You love all that stuff now, don't ya? Crowds and cheering. The bigger, the better? What's the matter? You're sick. Bill. Cashy, get in here. Bobby's sick. What did he eat yesterday? Just his usual feed and a bit of grass. - Alfalfa? - Yes. Was it wet? Look, it's not colic. It's something worse. I know what I'm doing. Ooh, matey. That's the boy. Bill. Cashy. Where the hell are ya? - What's the matter? - He's getting worse, Bill. Mate, come on. We'd better get the vet at Tanforan. Keep him moving. Ok. Come on. Come on. You've gotta keep going. Come on. Oh, Bobby, you can't. Please, get up. Please. Please, make him get up. Oh, Bobby. No. No, you can't die. Please. Please, no. Bobby. ♪ The wonder horse ♪ ♪ Known on every course ♪ ♪ From Australia to ♪ This is the Don Lee Radio Network. Today the turf world is in tears. Phar Lap, whom some say is the greatest... This is KMTR, Los Angeles. Governor Rolph of California has appealed to all the relevant agencies to mobilise their forces in a joint effort to seek out the cause of Phar Lap's death. Mr Wendell Vincent, chief of Western Food and Drug Administration, says that arsenic trioxide was found in the horse's liver and lungs. As his autopsy revealed no such evidence of... Dr T.R. Creel, an American vet, told the press that he didn't die of colic. They all suddenly got together and issued a joint statement saying, in effect, they don't know how he died and probably never will. However, Dr Nielsen, Phar Lap's Australian veterinarian declared he had no such doubts. The horse died of an irritant poison. And I know what it means when the lining has been eaten away. I'd like to have come to some other conclusion, but I'm afraid it's impossible. Please stand for 30 seconds, as a tribute to the great racehorse, Phar Lap, who died last week. This is KMTR, Los Angeles. Mr Telford. Mr Telford, can you have a few words with me about the tragedy? Leave me alone. Do you think he was poisoned? What does it matter? He's dead. Well, why is it, do you think, that there's been this incredible reaction to Phar Lap's death? After all, he was just a horse. He wasn't just a horse. He was the best. He's a bit skinny, isn't he, Harry? He's lost condition on the voyage over. Harry, he's only come from New Zealand. Well, he's just a colt. Why's he got all those warts? Well, you don't buy horses just for their looks. I wonder what your American friend's going to say. This has gotta be a joke. Harry, you got the real horse hidden around the back somewhere, right? He's got a good, big frame. Go on. This is not a horse, Harry. This is a cross between a sheepdog and a kangaroo. You told me this thing was gonna be a champion, huh? Well, he will be, Mr Davis. He's got Carbine on both sides of his bloodline. Greatest horse of them all. Greatest of them all. I paid £168 for this, Harry, sight unseen from a goddamn catalogue. Now, I'll tell you the truth, I don't really care who he's got in his family tree. Why the hell didn't you write across to New Zealand, ask somebody to look at him for you? Well, he'll fill out. He will, huh? Harry. Some guy told me his sire and dam were hopeless, didn't win a race between them. - Night Raid out of... - Entreaty. Entreaty. Did not win a single race, either one of them. Well, he's got good blood further back. Now, no one looks further back. Sell him. But you've gotta give him a chance. Why? I'm not paying you to feed and train something that looks like that. I'm not in the habit of throwing good money after bad, my friend. Well, if you sell him without giving him a chance, you're a fool. I assure you I'm no fool. Sell him for the best price you can get. I'll lease him, then. Well, I can't buy him. Haven't got the money. You sign him over to me for three years, I'll pay for his upkeep. Give you a third of his winnings. Three years? Well, if you're so bloody sure he's a no-hoper, what have you got to lose? What have I got to lose? How can we afford to lease him, Harry? I'm the one who has to face the feed merchant when he comes for his money on Mondays. You just scoot out the back. You've got about as much faith in me as Davis. You know who that colt's got in his bloodline? Carbine twice through Musket. There's St. Frusquin, Prayer Wheel, Winkle... Harry. I haven't even got the money to buy your son's new shoes. All Cappy's clothes are hand-me-downs. Well, that horse is gonna be a champion. Well, can't anyone understand that? He's gonna be a champion. Get out, you bastard. It's the big fella, Happy Harry's horse. Come on. Pick on someone your own size. Youse try and do better. - Think you're smart, don't ya? - Smarter than you, son. You try and put a bridle on him. He'll bloody well do the same to you. Come on, Tommy. Yeah, go on. Alright, I'll have a go. Ta. Ta. Good, mate. That's it. Ready. You got a real goer this time, Harry. Jeez, you can pick 'em, Harry. Harry knows his bloodlines. I suppose you'd pick one like that for me. Go on, you bloody mongrel. Get away. Excuse me. What is that horse's name? Milkal's Galloping Giraffe. - Cattle. - Rocket. How about Lightning? Mr Ping, what's the word for 'lightning' in your lingo? - Farlap. - Got a name for the colt, Harry. Lay off, McCready. No, seriously. Pingy reckons it's really lucky. I'll write it down for you, Mr Telford. Very lucky. Gotta have seven letters. Last four Melbourne Cup winners had seven letters. Melbourne Cup? You've gotta be joking. Yes, Mr Telford. Seven letters. Phar Lap it is. Take the bloody thing back to the stables. - Go, Lightning. - Good one, Lightning. "So the king saw the beautiful girl "with the golden star upon her brow..." "and was so enchanted with her beauty "that he asked if she would become his bride." Here's Daddy. What's wrong? Oh, he's lazy. Bone lazy. Still won't run. Oh, give up on him, Harry. Sell him. I'm not gonna give him that satisfaction. He's going to learn to work hard even if it kills me. You poor little beggar. Whoa, matey. Whoa, mate. You'll be alright, mate. Hold on. Hold on. You'll be right. Hold on, matey. Get up. Come on. Get yourself up. That's a boy. You're alright, are ya? Just worked into the bloody ground? I can't pay you this week, Tommy. Just have to wait till I have a win. I didn't come about that. I've just seen Phar Lap. Oh, yeah. He shouldn't have been left like that, boss. He looks half-dead. And I don't think you should work him so hard. There's one thing I don't tolerate, sonny, stable hands who tell me how to do my job. Now, pack your things and clear out. I was just worried about the horse. Hard work never killed any horse. If a few more trainers cottoned on to that they might do a lot better. Now, pack your things and get. And all you said was that he looked half-dead? I reckon it's just not fair. Keep your nose out of it, Emma, it's none of your business. But he is killing the horse, Missus. Lazy horses are like lazy people, they have to be jolted out of it. Now take your places, please. Don't let your food go cold. For what we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. - How's it going, boss? - G'day, boss. Mr Telford. - Boss. - Hey, boss. Don't go back up the bush, Tommy. Some other trainer will give you a job. Not when they hear I got the sack. Yes, they will, Tommy. They know what old Telford's like. Enough of that. Mr Telford's here to see you, Tommy. He's out on the porch. What's going on between you and young Tommy? - Nothing, Mum. - Better not be. Boss? What have you done to that horse? Spoiled him rotten. Anyone goes near him he rips their bloody shirt off. He won't eat, he won't... Now, get back to the stables. Get him fed. Reckon I got my job back. Gee, he's a rude old cow. I wouldn't go back. Better go. Bobby will fret. Bobby? Phar Lap. See you later. Those beggars who reckon you can't run are gonna get a shock today, old fella? He's really starting to fill out, boss. Hard work, puts muscle on. Are you gonna watch the race? I'll listen from down here. Oh, don't give him more sugar. He'll die of bloody diabetes before his first race. Harry, say hello to Mrs Davis. - Harry Telford. - How do you do? Ok, let's take a look at him. You said he was as ugly as a camel. You should have seen him a year ago. So, I understand his training times have been better recently, yeah? When he's ridden hard. He's still lazy. Have you put any money on him? - I don't bet. - I see. You're not exactly oozing confidence, are ya? I don't think I'll bet on him either. - Oh, I'm gonna have a bet on him. - Yeah? - What's your name? - Tom Woodcock, madam. I'm Phar Lap's strapper. - Do you think he'll win, Tom? - I reckon he will. As they pass the 3-furlong post, and Exact is the leader, about a length and a half in front of Memento. Then Phar Lap, the newcomer, the big red horse, moving up on the outside. Cabaret Girl on the inside of him, followed then by Busham and Rose Flight. Coming up towards the home turn, Phar Lap, rider having great trouble, and Exact has kicked away, about four to five lengths in front of Cabaret Girl, who's starting to make up ground, with Memento on the inside. And Phar Lap looks as if he is going to hit the outside fence. As they straighten up for the run to the judge now and Exact is four to five lengths in front of Memento, and Cabaret Girl moving up on the outside, and Phar Lap still racing wide. With half a furlong to go it's all Exact, and Exact is going to win easily about two lengths in front of Cabaret Girl. Memento third, a long distance then to Busham from Rose Flight, and Phar Lap ran last. - Do you like it? - Here, listen to this. "The big 2-year-old Phar Lad..." They can't even get the horse's name right. "Enhanced his reputation for consistency "by finishing last yet again." He's a real smart guy, this Bert Wolfe, huh? Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. Gorgeous. There's a boy. Go on, let me get on with it. Go on. Alright, up we go. Tommy. You can take Phar Lap out this morning. I'm taking young Cappy for a ride on Sally. And work him hard. - How's Lightning, Tommy? - Good. - Harry given up on him, has he? - Yeah, he's still in bed. You better hang onto him, he might take off. I wanna try something different this morning, Cashy. I'll hold Bobby back then see if I can get him to go out after you. - What's the sense of that? - We'll just try it. He's gotta learn to be a winner. After him now. Don't let him get away. Yes. You beauty. Good on you, mate. Alright, Cashy, let's try that again. Off with your cap. That's a good fella. Yeah. Up we go. Did he like it? Yeah, he's a regular little horseman here. Did Daddy take you on the big horsey? - Yeah. - I bet you're hungry. Are you hungry? We'll take your shoes and socks off. What's all this? I thought I told you to stop all that. We needed the money. Well, send 'em back. We can manage without you being a servant. - How, Harry? - We can manage. Harry, I'm sick to death of struggling for every penny. I won't have you taking in laundry. We'll manage. How, Phar Lap? He'll come good. He's got Carbine on both sides of his bloodline. Harry, people are laughing at you. He's hopeless. He's a dud. That's right, he's flying, Mr Davis. Yeah, I always knew he'd come good. Just needed a lot of hard work put into him. I've knocked that lazy streak out of him at last. No, no, you wait till you see him next time. The first race I ever rode was on one of Reg's horses. "Do you reckon I got a chance?" I said. "Yeah," he said. "The five other jockeys have backed you for a fortune." Could I have a word with you in private, Jim? You can talk in front of these blokes, Harry. If they hear it direct they can't spread any rumours. I've got a good horse for you, for the Derby. - Yeah? Who? - Phar Lap. I reckon I'm fixed up for the Derby, Harry. But I'll keep it in mind. Phar Lap, he's gotta be joking. Harry, the best horses in the country are entered into the Derby. Now, I know you're convinced the horse has improved, but, Harry, for Christ's sake, we're talking about the Derby. I'll be back in a second, honey. Sorry. I'm hoping to get Jim Pike. Jim Pike? Now I know you're dreaming. Why would Jim Pike wanna ride Phar Lap? He said he'd keep him in mind. Come on, he was being polite. Look, Harry, you wanna enter him, you enter him. But you make sure you do it under your name... not mine. I'm not gonna be humiliated in front of all the top owners in this country, believe me. I need 30 quid to enter him. Oh, boy. You wanna enter him, you find the money. That was part of our deal, right? I tried. Then I'm in very good company when I say no? Harry... alright, you can have the money. On two conditions, one, you don't use my name... and two, if that horse doesn't race well this time we sell him. Race well? He's gotta win. I owe more than 300 quid and I can't pay my rent. Pity Pike's lost his mount. Masterful horseman, compulsive gambler, though. Good luck in the Derby, Mr McKinnon. Oh, well, thank you. We think we'll give you a run for your money. You've got a horse in the Derby, Mrs...? - Davis. My husband, David. - How do you do? Sir Samuel Hordern. - Sir Samuel. - Yes, we have, Phar Lap. I don't believe I've heard of him. You probably wouldn't. He... he's just in for the run. And we think he'll win. - And where did you get him? - New Zealand. For £168, quite a bargain. Isn't your horse a New Zealander? Carradale. Yes, he is. Who in the blazes were they? Pushy little Jew. Sells dinnerware. Door to door. - Knows nothing about horses. - He's not a member, is he? Hard to keep them out these days. Handsome woman, though. - Did you have to do that? - What? McKinnon practically runs racing in this country. Did you have to tell him what Phar Lap cost? He paid 10 times that much for Carradale. Mrs Davis. What do you think, Tommy? There's some good horses out there today, Mrs Davis. My husband will tell me I'm a fool but I'm gonna back him anyway. Does Mr Telford always get that nervous? If Bobby doesn't win today, he's finished. Suppose I am too. I've been looking for you, Harry. My horse for the Derby's been scratched. Flies when he's fit, but if there's a germ between here and Perth he'll pick it up. Would you like me to ride Phar Lap? £20? You bet £20...? Bea, you're crazy, you know that? Why? Why did you do that? I just felt lucky. Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a late change of rider. Number two, Phar Lap, will now be ridden by J. Pike. Go. They're off in the AJC Derby, and Carradale was one of the best to begin and is being ridden hard to the lead in the early stages, while Phar Lap has missed the start badly, he's last as they settle down. £20. Carradale crossed over the rails to lead about a length and a half to Honour and Toper. They were followed by Cathmar, Comanche, Lorason, Pentheus, Nedda, Queen Nassau and Phar Lap. As they race down to the straight and the leader is Carradale, a length and a half to the good of Toper. Honour is next, over on the rails. They were followed further back by, sir Ribble and Lorason, then Pentheus and Nedda, Queen Nassau, and Phar Lap is still last. They race towards the back and Carradale kicked away. It's Carradale... Sir Ribble next, on the outside of Comanche. And Phar Lap is still on the tail of the field. Lorason ahead of him, with Pentheus, Nedda and Queen Nassau. But Carradale shows the way in front. Go. Here's Phar Lap going around them quickly now about three or four deep. Go, Bobby. But here's Phar Lap coming quickly now. Comanche's back in midfield. Carradale in front, but here's Phar Lap going up very quickly now. Go, Bobby. Go. Carradale and Phar Lap, they're locked together head and head as they race towards the turn. Carradale on the inside and Phar Lap on the outside. And they've moved away about three lengths further, followed by Toper and Cathmar. Phar Lap on the outside of Carradale. Pike says, "Go now," and Phar Lap races to the lead in the Derby. About two or three lengths to the good of Cathmar. But the big red horse, Phar Lap, he's racing away with the AJC Derby. It's Phar Lap's Derby. But it's Phar Lap's Derby, he's won the Derby very easily. You'll find that the winner will be Phar Lap, ridden by Jim Pike, second will be Carradale, and third will be Honour. After the 1929 AJC Derby... Come on, boss, you've gotta get the sash. I can't, Tommy. I can't. Number two, Phar Lap, J. Pike, the winner. Second was number nine, Carradale... Don't say I didn't warn you, Mr McKinnon. - Congratulations, Mrs... - Davis. Davis. Promising horse. It will be interesting to see how he performs when he gets a decent weight on his back. - Davis? - Yes? Ah... gentlemen. Is it true you've always thought the horse wasn't any good? No. Who told you that? - It's a story going around. - Well, there's no truth to it. I've had utter faith in this horse from the very beginning. Then why did you lease him to Harry Telford? Oh, because Mr Telford found the horse and I thought it was only fair. Now, I want to make it clear that I've had absolute faith in this horse from the very first moment I laid eyes upon him. I suppose you had a lot of money on him, then. - Well... - We did quite well. Thank you. £7,135. Well, a third of it has to go to Davis. Oh, Harry, let's put it into something safe. Your brother reckons we should buy a property. I can't raise sheep. You said it yourself a dozen times, that training's a rotten life. Oh, yeah, well, it is. When you've just got a few hacks stuck in rented stables. I'm gonna have my own place now, love, and run things my way. And Cappy and I will see even less of you than we do now. Well, what do you think it's like for us, Harry? You're up at 3:30 every morning and by the afternoon you're dead on your feet. What do you expect me to do, woman? Slink back to the bush just when I finally get my chance? Sorry, love. Look... Phar Lap wasn't a fluke, you know. I picked him from the bloodlines and I persevered with him while every other trainer was laughing at me. No one's laughing now. You've proved your point. I haven't even begun. I know more about bloodlines and training than any other bastard in this country. And by the time I've finished... they'll all know it. And the big red, Phar Lap, has burst away. But now here comes the big red down the centre of the track, Phar Lap, he's starting to storm home out wide. Phar Lap races up and goes to the lead, and it's another effortless victory for Phar Lap. The Wall Street stock market crash has caused a crisis in the American economy. The 3-year-old racehorse Phar Lap continues his run of good luck. The best I ever rode. In fact, I don't think there ever was his equal. Certainly not during my time. Phar Lap is dashing well clear of the opposition. He's racing away, nothing can catch him. And don't the Victorian crowd love it? I've got nothing against Telford or even Davis. But let's face it, they're not going to put any time and effort back into the sport like we're doing. Exactly. They've just happened on a horse with very indifferent breeding and a freakish turn of speed. And they're entering him in everything for the money. Phar Lap, most sensational Australian galloper of all time. Record-breaking streak, four wins and £4,000 in a fortnight. This has been an amazing week for Phar Lap. He's been entered in three major VRC races and won the lot. What a horse. Pike says it's Phar Lap's phenomenal speed that makes him so superior to all other horses. They just happen to be killing horse racing. A lot of my friends are saying it's not worth putting their horses against Phar Lap. And the bookmakers won't take bets. Well, the way Telford's over racing and over training him... he can't have too many more wins left in him. It's Phar Lap. Pike's letting the champion have his head. He's racing away. Nothing can stop the 'Red Terror'. Kick him along. Come on. He's surely a horse and a half. The Red Terror, here he is in action again, only cantering this time. Our cameraman is racing after him but he's getting away. After him, Malcolm Campbell, or you'll lose him. The sand roll... and how Phar Lap enjoys it. "Rolls the wriggles out," he tells the stable boy, young Tommy Woodcock. "Come here, sir, I want my sugar. I've earned it." Oh, what a horse. Back to work, go on. Come on, get that contraption out of here. Harry... this is Eric Connolly. - Harry. - I know. Harry... Eric's been kind enough to offer some suggestions about managing Phar Lap's career. I'll bet he has. Which races the horse is allowed to win and which ones he's not. Stake money, Harry. Peanuts. Compared with what you could make with a few well-placed bets. When I train horses, Connolly, I train them to win. Pulling horses is not in my line. Do you understand that we could make an extraordinary amount of money here? - I'm doing alright. - But I'm not. Well, that's your problem. Now get outta here. I've got work to do. What's wrong with you? He's being worked too hard, boss. Are you telling me I don't know my job? He's worn out. Then how come he's still winning? He'd win if he was half-dead. If you keep him racing and training like this you'll burn him out. You know your trouble, sonny? You think horses are human. Well, I've been around long enough to know that if you treat 'em too soft they'll take advantage of you every time. Now, if you want to come with me and your beloved Bobby when we go to Melbourne, you just better button your lip and do what you're told. And I'll top-dress all the paddocks. We'll have grass greener than you've ever seen it. The marshes over there, full of birds, snipe, everything. Do you like it? It could do with a few more trees over here. Well, we'll plant them. As many as you want. Trees everywhere. We'll have space all around us at last. I still don't understand why we couldn't find a place near Sydney. I told you a hundred times, Melbourne is the racing capital. The big owners are here. The big races. The big crowds. Now, if you're going to make your mark, this is the place you have to be. - I'll just miss my friends. - Well, we'll make new ones. Good God, woman, when this place is set up it will be like paradise. You'll have to beat the visitors off with a stick. Look, we're going to have a racetrack over here. Really make something of that wreck of a house. - Can we have a bit of a garden? - Yeah, roses and everything. Swings and slides for Cappy. It's hard to imagine. As long as we're not getting in too deep. I've worked on a shoestring long enough to know the only way to make it in this game is do it big. Now, you buy your yearlings, you train 'em hard, and if they don't shape up you get rid of 'em and bring in some more. Sol's no fool. He wouldn't be lending me money if there was any risk. Every champion for the next 20 years is going to come out of this place. Are you going to go down to Melbourne with Telford? I suppose. He's treated you pretty rotten. Yeah, he's a cranky old ratbag. But if I don't go down, what will happen to Bobby? Will you write? Spelling's pretty crook. Well, you'd better not, then. I can't stand bad spelling. - Keep him moving, Tommy. - Stand back. Harry... how did the wonder horse travel? Oh, I love the way you blokes keep calling him the "wonder horse". You weren't calling him that when he was losing all his races at the start. Well, he's really found form now. Who do you think made him find the form? Do you reckon he learned all by himself? And you think he'll win the Melbourne Cup? Of course he will. And the Caulfield Cup. - You've entered him in both? - Why not? He'll win them. A lot of owners would think it was too strenuous for him. A lot of owners don't know anything about horses. We've heard a lot about this new training establishment you're starting at Braeside, is it ready yet? - Near enough. - Make way. Stand back. Stand back, please. - Looks good? - Wonderful. Harry, the bank's just been on the phone. They said we're overdrawn, badly. Well, they're mad. I checked the figures last night. Here. No wonder the country's in a mess. Bloody banks can't even do their sums. Harry, you've counted the six in the thousands column instead of the hundreds. - Oh, God, so I have. - Let me do the books. What are we going to tell the bank? They'll just have to wait till Phar Lap wins both the cups. What do we do till then? Tell 'em the cheque's in the mail. Amounis and Phar Lap are the two best horses in the country, right? Now, if they both race in the Caulfield Cup, no offence, May, but Phar Lap's gonna come in first and Amounis second. And if they both race in the Melbourne Cup, the same thing's gonna happen, ok? Now, Bea, if you were a bookmaker and I wanted to lay a bet with you that Phar Lap would win both cups, what kind of odds would you give me? - Very short odds. - Right. Now, if I wanted to lay a bet that Amounis would win the Caulfield and Phar Lap the Melbourne, then what kind of odds would you give me? Much better odds. Amounis won't beat Phar Lap. Exactly. So we put the money on the Amounis-Phar Lap double, now at what, Eric? 20, 30 to 1. And at the last minute... we scratch Phar Lap from the Caulfield and make a fortune. Can you do things like that? Well... Can you get the money on, Eric? I'll have bets all round the country before they know what's hit 'em. Of course, we only have one problem, convincing Harry to pull Phar Lap out of the Caulfield. Give him a share of the winnings. An honest man is someone who hasn't had a good enough offer. You don't know Harry. Alright, look, I'll go through the figures with you once again. Whether you win both cups or not, you're still gonna be bankrupt within the next six months. Here. Some of those yearlings are going to be champions. Well, you won't know that for at least a year. Harry, I am offering you £20,000 cash to scratch Phar Lap from the Caulfield Cup. - No. - "No." You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy. What the hell is the difference? He'll still win the Melbourne Cup. - That's the important one. - He's going to win them both. Why? Why? Because it's what every trainer worth his salt dreams. Dreams. Dream... Vi. You're good with figures. Will you please explain to the man that I'm right? Will you tell him that he's gonna be broke within six months? Harry's been in this game for 20 years and he's never been dishonest. We can sell the yearlings and put off staff. Harry, scratch the horse and take the £20,000. I can't sell the yearlings. One of them will turn out to be a champion, nothing surer. We could start again in a year, Harry. Anyway, we don't have to sell all of them. Maybe he has been raced too much. Perhaps he does need a rest. Can't you blokes ever leave a man alone? I've been trying to telephone you, Harry, but you're always engaged. I leave the phone off the hook and you still try to drive me barmy. Why did you scratch Phar Lap from the Caulfield Cup, Harry? He's run-down, needs a rest. You told me a few days ago he was at his peak. Why don't you just clear off? Harry... someone's put £50,000 on Amounis to win the Caulfield and Phar Lap to win the Melbourne. And they've got odds of 30 to 1. Nothing to do with me. I'd be a bit worried if I were you. Why? Mrs Telford. If Amounis wins the Caulfield... the only way some bookies can save their necks is to stop Phar Lap winning the Melbourne Cup. No one would hurt a champion like Phar Lap. You'd be surprised what people will do if they stand to lose a million pounds, Harry. Look after yourself. And your horse. They're rounding the home turn and Muratti is the leader from Lampra, Shadow King, Second Wind is joining in. As they straighten up and Amounis is coming with a big turn of speed. Coming to the furlong pole, Muratti still in front. Amounis is starting to peg him back under his big weight. Amounis has ranged up on the outside with a half furlong to go. Soulton coming home well, with Alcman and Cragford, Second Wind. But Amounis is going on to score a great win in the Caulfield Cup. And Amounis has won by a half-length to Soulton, third Alcman. Hello? I'm telling you again, take your horse out of the cup or it's going to end up as dog's meat. Bobby. Come on, Bobby. There's a boy. Yeah, g'day. Come on, then. It's all a lot of hot air. Nobody would dare hurt you or the horse. It's alright for you. I'm the one who's in the firing line. Vi's even too scared to leave the house. I started getting these letters as soon as Amounis won the Caulfield Cup. Now, they say the big fella's gonna be poisoned, run down by a truck, shot at by a poison dart, have acid thrown in his eyes. Well, how would you like that sort of thing in the mail? - I'm gonna call the police. - No. I don't want you to do that. There's no reason, Woodcock is with the horse all the time. Well, his life's at stake too. If you don't call the police, I will. Harry, if you call the police they're only gonna ask why the horse is getting all these threats. Do you understand? Alright, I'll hire a guard, if it'll make you happy. I've been over him, boss, he hasn't been touched. What happened? Did you just stand there and let him get shot at? Fair go, Harry. The lad put himself between the horse and the gun. In my opinion, he deserves a bloody medal. Sorry, son. Come on, Bobby boy. Harry. - Is he alright? - No thanks to you. What happened to that guard that you were going to arrange? We don't have time to argue now, we gotta get this horse somewhere safe. - Fast, before they try again. - Is he alright? You better get him somewhere safe too. If they can't shoot the horse, they might try to shoot you. Don't worry. I'll take care of him, you watch out for the horse. - Have you got some place safe? - I'll take him... I don't want to know. Get him there and keep him there until cup day. Now, can you get some guns? Guns? Alright, good. Don't be afraid to use them. You come with me. Let's go. Like this? I've just come from the steam bath. Like that. Let's go. Will the shooting make any difference to the race plans, Mr Davis? Gentlemen, do Mr Telford or I look like men who are easily frightened? Thank you. We are a pioneering nation, forged out of the wilderness by men who knew the value of their horses and their dogs. For an Australian to shoot at a thoroughbred is almost unthinkable. In my books, this is a day of profound national shame. Alright. I don't want you leaving this room for anything. There'll be a guard outside the door to get you your food. Food? You must be joking. I've got another 4 lb. To lose and no bloody steam bath. - Don't eat. - Hey, I've gotta lay me bets. No bets. Mr Raymond? - Whereabouts are your stables? - Right through here. Right. Try now. Give a man a go. Well done, Sergeant. I had to, got a couple of quid on Phar Lap. Davis. - Yes? - Where's that horse of yours? I wish I knew. If he's not here an hour before the race he'll be disqualified. You try that and you'll have a riot on your hands. Half this country's backing him today. We'll put the race back 15 minutes. 15 minutes. Harry... where the hell is he? What? They should have been here an hour ago. There's a fortune at stake and you lose the goddamn horse. Don't blame me. What do you mean, don't blame you? The horse was your responsibility. Come on, find him. Fast. - Let's go. - Alright. The chargers for the Melbourne Cup of 1930 are now parading in... If he's here I'll ride him, if he's not, I won't. Fair enough? Didn't even get a chance to back myself in any case. Here are the starters and riders in the 1930 Melbourne Cup. I just sent Telford out to look for him. There's really nothing more I can do, is there? We can't wait any longer. We've got rules. Phar Lap. Phar Lap. Phar Lap. Phar Lap. Well, I suggest you get your committee together and change the rules. Where the hell are they? Keep going. - About bloody time. - We broke down, boss. It won't be long now, Bobby boy. Can't let you miss this one? As the horses file out onto the track, the mystery still remains, where is Phar Lap? - Go round to the Members. - I can't go in there. Do as you're bloody well told. Soulton, followed by Nadean and Some Quality. Shadow King, just going down the track, is a picture of fitness. And there's Soulton, the great runner-up in the Caulfield Cup, ridden by Frank Dempsey. Carradale, ridden by Harold Jones. And here comes Phar Lap. The mighty champion has arrived. They can't stop us now, Bobby boy. Show 'em, Pikey. If anything catches us today, mate, it'll have to have wings. Phar Lap is just moving into place now and we're ready for the start of the 1930 Melbourne Cup, the richest and most illustrious event on the Australian racing calendar and one of the great racing events of the world. We're running late. And they're getting some sort of a line. Shadow King standing well. Phar Lap with the red colours, the white sleeves, black armbands, that red cap, looking a picture of fitness as they move up for a start in the 1930 Melbourne Cup. The starter looks to be happy with them. They're coming in very well. Steady. Steady. Go. And they're off. And on the inside, first out was Second Wind from Tregilla, who began well. Temptation is prominent. And Carradale is up there. As they come onto the course proper the first time, where the leader here is Temptation, showing out from Carradale. They're going forward on the outside, followed by Second Wind. And a bit further back is Shadow King, and Phar Lap is well back in the field. As they come down the straight... Ha. The wonder horse seems to have run out of steam. You can't buy real quality for 160 guineas. - No. - Carradale's going well, Lachlan. He's going to win me that cup. And Phar Lap is next, on the outside of Muratti. And a fair way back is Shadow King, on the side of the track. It's Temptation showing out by 1.5 lengths. Now. Off you go, Bobby boy. That's it. Some Quality and Phar Lap, eased off the fence by Jim Pike, is starting to go forward rapidly. As they come around the back of the course, it's still Temptation out in the lead, from Carradale, running a good race, second. Second Wind on the inside of Shadow King. And here comes Phar Lap down the outside. You've won it. Now, don't get carried away. A little bit of modesty wouldn't go astray. Does he really know why they're cheering? Know? It's the only reason he wins. Vain as a peacock, aren't ya? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here also. Guys, could you play something local for my very dear and very close friend, Mr Harry Telford. Thank you. (Band plays 'Along the Road to Gundagai') Of course, the real danger when you're riding Phar Lap is he's so bloody smooth and easy, you're liable to drop off... to sleep. Congratulations, Mr Davis. Thank you, boys. Here you are, kid. Thanks very much, Mr Davis. A tenner? A tenner for the best little strapper in Australia? You lousy bastard. He's drunk. The horse only wins because Tom tells him to. Yeah, you tell him. Here you go, Tommy. Here, buy yourself a lemonade. Jimmy, you can't give me that much. I just have. I just have. Excuse me. Hey, Davis. Don't be stingy, let the moths out of your purse. Yeah, come on. Throws money around like a bloke with no arms. Take it all, kid. Thanks. Anyway, so there I am having a little snooze. Suddenly I wake up and we're halfway down the straight and all these horses out in front. And I thought, "Crikey, I might have to use the whip." - Mrs Davis. - Oh, please, sit down. How does it feel to be a wealthy man? I reckon I should give some back. Back? I came over to give you some more. Oh, Mrs Davis, no... Dave won a fortune today. Thanks. What are you gonna do with it? God, I don't know. Isn't there a girl in Sydney you're fond of? Emma? I've only taken her out once or twice. Do you write to her? I've sent her a postcard or two. Is she pretty? Too right. I reckon if she was in America, she could be in films. Oh, as pretty as that. Yeah. You ask Cashy. And all those stars have got make-up and everything to help 'em. She looks just as good as they do without it. Have you told her that? Wouldn't be game. Why not? You'd make a real dill of yourself. Sometimes I wonder how Australian men ever manage to find themselves wives. Go up to Sydney and see her, Tommy. I want you to know that whatever differences you and I have had personally through the years, I have never, ever doubted your ability as a trainer. And when your lease on Phar Lap is up, I still want you to stay on and train him. You're not gonna offer me a share? Sure. You'll get your training fees plus 10% of his winnings. But I found that horse. I made him a champion. And you've also had him for 3 years and won yourself a Melbourne Cup. You give me 50% of him or find some other trainer. Don't threaten me, Telford. There are plenty of other good trainers around. Well, you find one who'll make him win as often as I do. Stubborn bastard. - Who? - Harry. He wants a half-share on the horse. Can you believe it? As if it was his right. He's done very well with the horse, Dave. So? You think he's entitled to a half-share? Well, people will think you're being pretty unfair if you don't offer. What the hell do I care what people think? Where were all these people when I was 11 years old and walked halfway across Europe? Nobody lifted a goddamn finger to help me. Would it be wise to change trainers? Harry's had a lot of success. Alright, I'll offer him half share but he's gonna pay me good money for it, whether he likes it or not. Boss? Yeah? That ointment you're using, it's making his heel worse. I know what I'm doing. Is he getting any better? Worse. Well, what does this mean in terms of the horse's future? Mightn't have a future. Wait a minute. Harry. A cracked heel can't stop a horse from racing. Can it? I'm afraid so, Dave. Happens all the time. A man would be a fool to pay £20,000 for a share in the big fella now. Don't you think £20,000 is a bit too much to ask Harry to pay? He didn't pay £20,000, he paid £4,000. What? To tell you the truth, I was lucky to get that. The horse is lame. Could be washed up, finished. Oh, Dave. Phar Lap, Phar Lap. No future, huh? Nothing can stop him. Weight could stop him. Weight could stop a train. No Phar Lap. Phar Lap punts are off. And now we see this ridiculous sight of the two horses. Phar Lap and Chide. Phar Lap is just so much better. Chide is flat out, now let Phar Lap go and it's little more than an exercise gallop. And Phar Lap wins... No more. You can close the bag. No more bets, punters. I've had enough of Phar Lap. He's getting as much weight as any other horse has ever got. He's not any other horse. He's a freak and should be weighted accordingly. The weight's making no difference to Phar Lap. He's drawn away for a great win. He can't carry more weight, Lachlan. There'd be a huge outcry. We're here to further the interests of racing. And the mighty champion has forged to the lead, and despite his crushing weight, Phar Lap is racing on to a gallant win. That run bloody nearly killed him today. - He's alright. - He's not alright, Harry. I give you fair warning, I've never had a horse drop dead under me yet and I don't want the first one to be Phar Lap. Dave? Yeah? Dave, I'd like you to meet Jim Crofton. - Jim. - Dave. - Quite a horse you got there. - Yeah, thanks. He barely won by a whisker today. It's a wonder he could run at all with all the weight they put on him. If you want my candid opinion, I think it's criminal. Jim runs the Water Caliente Racecourse in Mexico. Oh, yes. Yeah. I'll level with you, Dave. We're organising a really big race down there. We want your horse. We'll pay all your expenses, of course. $100,000 stake. Richest race in history. He seemed to be struggling to win today. Apart from all the weight, he's got a crook heel and a bad cold. Oh, Tommy. His pulse is still racing. Well, why did Mr Telford enter him if he's got a cold? Oh, he enters him for everything and trains him to death as well. Why? He needs the money to keep Braeside going. He's pretty obsessed with Braeside, isn't he? Oh, he's mad. He bought another 10 yearlings last week, and none of them look any good to me. Don't worry about it. I'll talk to Dave. I shouldn't have said anything, Mrs Davis. I can understand how you feel. You'll be right, Red. You'll be right. Did you ever go and see Emma? No. Heard she was going around with another bloke. Oh, Tommy, you can't give in like that. Go and see her, and make your intentions clear. Go on. Propose. Yeah. Reckon I might. G'day, Emma. Tommy. What are you doing up here? I got a present for you. I want you to marry me. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Put it on your finger before you lose it. I thought you were never gonna get round to it. Nice big smile. Ok, mums and dads now, please. Cashy, Ian, what are you two doing up here? The boss sent us up here, Tommy. The big fella's fretting and won't eat. He says you gotta come back straight away. Now. But... what about Emma? What about the honeymoon? There's no time, mate. Bobby's real bad. Come on, we've got a car across the street. Wait a minute. I've gotta tell her. You pair of bastards. Congratulations, mate. Good on ya. Well, that's the end of Phar Lap. They've given him 10 stone 10 for the Melbourne Cup. What are they trying to do, kill him? If they have to. Has any horse ever carried that much weight in a 2-mile race? Nowhere near it. I'm a tolerant man, Jack, as you know, but finally I'm forced to the conclusion that McKinnon and his cronies are a pack of pricks. Maybe Mr Davis won't let him run. Yes, he will. He wants the gold cup. Telford got it last year... and he won't pull him out because he needs the money. Even the papers are saying if he runs, it could finish him. They're right. It'll kill him. Everyone says so. Telford's getting a stack of mail begging him to pull Bobby out. You can bet your life he won't take a bit of notice. Keep on at him. He just won't listen. Then make him listen, Tommy. Don't start again. He's running and that's final. You'll kill him. I'll kill him? Bull. That bloody horse is killing me. Letters, phone calls, press, telegrams, cranks abuse me. Never had a minute's peace since I got him. Don't you care what happens to him? Nothing's gonna happen to him. You're the one who's gonna have to face your conscience if it does. It's not just up to me. Davis wants that cup. He can forget about that. Boss, you know there's no way he'll win it. Oh, you're probably right. No horse could win over two miles carrying that weight. So, if Mr Davis agrees to scratch him, will you go along with it? I suppose I'll have to. It's the only way you'll give me any peace. He won't win it, Mr Davis. I don't understand why you're so worried. If there's too much weight on him, it'll slow him down and he won't win, ok, but you're talking as though... He'll bust a gut trying, Mr Davis. Really. I know him. Kid, come on, you wanna do me a favour? Cut the violins. Mr Davis, why do you think he got up last week, when he was crook and still won? Why do you think Jim Pike's never had to use the whip? He was in a terrible state after the race, Dave. He'd still try and win if his legs were cut off. Mr Davis, I know how much you want to win the cup... Not just the cup. We have an obligation to the public. He can still keep winning for years in weight-for-age where they can't handicap him out of it. You're putting his whole future at risk. Tommy knows the horse better than anyone. Alright, alright, alright. It's alright with me. But you're still gonna have to get Harry to agree, and that is... He already has. Ah, Davis. It was good of you to come at such short notice. I'll get straight to the point. There's a strong rumour going around that your horse is to be scratched from the cup. His name is Phar Lap. - Is it true? - Yes. Would you mind telling me why? Because you've given him an impossible weight to carry. You mean the handicappers? No, I meant you. Are you implying, Mr Davis, that we try and influence the handicappers? Yes. I won't even bother to answer that charge. You realise, of course, that under our rules, you can't scratch a horse without a good reason. We have it on very good advice that Phar Lap could be permanently incapacitated if he runs. Nonsense. We've been assured that the horse is in no danger whatsoever. Wait a minute. Excuse me. Let me understand this. Are you ordering me to run him? I'm requesting you very strongly. Oh, I see. If we find he's been scratched without good cause, we can ban you and any horse you're associated with from ever racing in this State again. Do you mind repeating that? The race-going public are expecting your horse to run... His name is Phar Lap. Horse's name is Phar Lap. And I don't see why two owners with a grudge against the handicappers and the VRC should deprive them of that. I see. You put a ton on his back so that he can't possibly win, but you want him there to draw the crowds. Very smart. I'm acting in the best interests of racing. Well... you've finally done it, haven't you, now, McKinnon? If we scratch him, he's barred from racing and if we run him, there's a very good chance of his breaking down, and either way, you and your cronies win it all, don't you? I don't think there's any purpose in prolonging this conversation. No, there really isn't. Take it easy today, alright? Don't go busting your boiler. He'll be alright, Tom. If I see he's gone, I won't push him. Thanks, Pikey. And here's Phar Lap, number one, in line for his second Melbourne Cup being led out onto the track. They're off. And White Nose was one of the first to jump out, with Phar Lap beginning well. St Mary away quickly and so also is Koomela. He's prominent but just in behind is Carry On. And then Concentrate, a bit further back in the field, Madstar. They're racing down the straight for the first time, and White Nose in charge, leads by a length and a half. Moving up on the outside, Koomela is second, then Second Wind, and Phar Lap running over on the inside as they pass the judge and go towards the side of the track... Coming down past the '3' now, and White Nose on the inside is still in front. He's been taken by Second Wind, and here comes the mighty Phar Lap. Phar Lap is coming up quickly now, behind White Nose, Phar Lap is trying to bridge the gap with White Nose. Phar Lap on the outside, coming up with White Nose. Second Wind and Shadow King on the left. White Nose is holding Phar Lap. This is incredible, he's struggling under his big weight. Phar Lap is starting to weaken, it's White Nose and Second Wind... Give it up, boy. It's alright. Phar Lap is dropping out of the quick, and White Nose is going for the shot with Shadow King. Phar Lap is dropping and White Nose will come down to line before... Crofton. Excuse me. - Does your offer still stand? - Sure does. Look, there's not a horse in the world could have won over that distance carrying that weight. I'm amazed he even finished without breaking down. Let's talk, alright? - Too many risks. - What risks? The voyage over, going into their winter, dirt tracks, different feeding, different styles of racing. Cashy. If you take him over there, our quarantine laws are gonna make it bloody hard to bring him back home. Alright, I grant you it's a risk. But if it pays off, Harry, we're gonna have more money than we ever thought we'd have in our lives. Alright. Take him. Great. We're gonna have to be ready to go in about three weeks, ok? I'm not going. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean you're not going? I got 40 horses to look after here. Three of them are coming up for their first race. You have to go. Who's gonna train the horse? - Tommy. - Woodcock? What the hell does he know about training? He's a good strapper. Best I've ever had. This is not what I'm asking you, I said, "What does he know about training?" You're gonna have to take him with you anyway, the bloody horse won't even fart unless Tommy tells him it's alright. Harry, I can't go to the States without you. I'm not going. I'm sick of the sight of him. Bloody horse has given me trouble since I got him. You won't forget to write. Of course not. Because I wanna know what the Americans talk like. What they eat, how they dress. What they think about Bobby. - Yeah. - You gotta write everything. I'll try my best. Oh, I know you'll be busy. Gee, I'm gonna miss you, Tommy. Hey, Bobby's on. Train's ready to go. Go on, I'm not looking. All aboard. Here, come on, Tommy. The bloody train's going. - I love you. - Ta-ta. Come on. Suppose I'd better go, boss. You're the boss now, Tom. One more thing. Don't be too soft on him. Good luck, Tommy. Here's trouble. Well, Dave. What a surprise. Alright, don't bullshit me now, Crofton. What's going on? Dave, this is our chairman, Baron Long. - You're looking good, Dave. - I'm looking terrible. I asked you something, what's going on? Mr Davis, please don't get alarmed... The minute I stepped onto that wharf, there was a reporter there asking me, how do I feel about Water Caliente going broke? It was a very nice welcome back to my native land. Thank you. Just calm down, Dave. Look, we got a little bit of a cash problem due to the current economic situation, but once our publicity machine gets rolling, that horse of yours is gonna pull us right out of the red. If I had known you wanted Phar Lap as publicity bait, I never would have put him on that boat. Do you know the risks I've taken getting him here? Mr Davis, don't panic. The race will be run. You'll get your $100,000, plus your expenses, plus your bets and everyone will end up happy. Sure, by the time the race is run, everybody in America is going to be talking about your horse, Dave. Welcome, gentlemen. Welcome. May I introduce you to the lucky owner of the world's greatest galloper, Mr Dave Davis. Thank you again. I'd like to start things off by introducing Phar Lap's trainer, Mr Woodcock. His strapper, Mr Martin. His vet, Mr Nielsen. His jockey, Mr Elliot. And this beautiful young lady here is my wife, Bea. Now, gentlemen, any questions, please. Is he really the world's greatest galloper, Mr Davis? Well, without taking anything away from your great American champions, yes, I truly believe so. Have you seen the field he's up against? Yes. Spanish Play, Joe Flores, Cabezo, Reveille Boy. Well, fine horses all of them, but believe me when I tell you, gentlemen, they are no threat to Phar Lap. Gentlemen, I have seen the Red Terror race with my own eyes, and I can sum it up in one word, unbelievable. Won't he have trouble acclimatising? I don't think so. We've brought everything to make him feel at home. We've even brought his food all the way from Australia. Can we get a few pictures? Certainly, gentlemen, no problem at all. Tommy, you wanna bring the horse over here for the gentlemen... That'll do. It's hot out here, no good for the horse. Tom, you wanna bring the horse over here, please? Don't forget to show his hindquarters, gentlemen. Please, it's very important. Tom, where the hell are you going? He came here to race, not to do this bullshit. The most powerful hindquarters in the world, gentlemen. Get a good shot. Tom, come back here, goddammit. This is the National Press. He should have been fed an hour ago. Please, gentlemen. Plenty of food and drink at the pavilion. Did you hear that? Looks like you've got yourself a good trainer. What is this Woodcock guy? The press can't get near that animal of yours. He's guarding him as if he could eat straw and pass gold. We really need the publicity, Dave. I know. He even sleeps with the horse. What, is he some kind of pervert? Well, can't you just... fire the guy? If I did, the goddamned horse would sit in his stall for the next month and cry. - When's he gonna gallop? - In a week or two. A week or two? I'm bringing him up to peak slowly. Harry would have been working his butt off by now, you know? I'm not Harry. You're getting too smart for your own good, you know that, kid? I want that horse fit. He will be. Have you changed his shoes yet, like the track vet advised you to? He's been wearing the kind he's got on all his life. The track vet doesn't know what he's talking about. The track vet doesn't know what he's talking about, huh? You were told about the harder surfaces over here, weren't you? You were told he could pick up a stone. Well? He'll have to be scratched. No, he's gotta run. I got him backed for a fortune. Well, there's nothing I can do. Half his hoof is hanging off. Cut it away, Bill. It'll heal. - Before the race? - It'll heal. Hold it. Is there any chance? It's possible. Then do it. Now, how are you gonna get him fit? Walk him. I'll keep him moving all day. You know something? Harry must have been out of his mind when he recommended you as a trainer. And I must have been out of my mind to listen to him. - Mr Davis. - What? Harry Telford used to train that horse too hard. If I can get him 90% fit, his heart'll get him to the line. The amount of faith you put in that heart of his, kid, it must be one hell of an organ. There are rumours that the horse is carrying a serious injury. The horse is fit, totally fit. Then why hasn't he been out on the track? What about all these rumours that his hoof is cracked? Gentlemen, Phar Lap has stepped on a stone and bruised his foot. - How badly? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. We put a mud pack on it and we do not expect that it will significantly interfere with the horse's preparation. Then when are we likely to see... Thank you, gentlemen, that's it. Well, it's healing. Faster than I expected but not fast enough for him to run. He's gotta run. If he wins here, I've got offers for him from all over the States. Bill, what about we try fitting bar shoes? To support him across here and take pressure off the split. Well, has he worn them before? - No. - No, he hasn't. Well, what do you think? Well, it's worth a try. But you won't be able to give him anything but light track work right up to the race. That's alright. That alright, huh? We're going into the richest race in history with a horse that's half fit and lame. That's wonderful. Jimmy, what the hell is happening with Phar Lap? Baron, there's no problem. There better not be. The whole of the US is talking about the horse. Did you see Walter Winchell's column yesterday? Fantastic. We're gonna have our biggest crowd ever. What the hell is he doing here? A lot of money went on to Reveille Boy yesterday. Yeah, I bet a lot more went into the pockets of certain jockeys too. Is Phar Lap well guarded? Oh, yeah. I got Frank and the boys with him round the clock. Problem is, by the time Bert gets his story through, we're not gonna have time to get it on the streets. What are we gonna do, then? We have two versions ready to go. If he wins, "Australian wonder horse beats the world." And if he loses? "New Zealand horse fails in Mexico." Harry... there's something wrong with these figures. There's £2,000 missing somewhere. Yeah, I had a bet. On Phar Lap? No, on one of my colts on Saturday. He lost. Harry, you never bet. I did and he lost. £2,000? Harry, if you're going to start gambling our money away, I'd like to be told. We're in worse debt now than we've ever been, do you realise that? Phar Lap will win. What if he doesn't? He'll win at Caliente. And he'll win everywhere else he races. For years, I've kidded myself that I made that horse. Truth is, he would've been a champion no matter who trained him. I've got 20 colts out there with bloodlines as good or better than his and I've trained them all exactly the same. Every one's a dud. He's a freak. Dave? Dave, if your horse wins today, get him out of here quickly and have him guarded from here on in. What are you talking about? It's just that... the big syndicates here have racing pretty well organised. Now, the last thing they want is a horse coming in from the outside who wins everything and can't be bought. I'll start worrying about that if he wins. But first, he's gotta win. Yeah. Just... keep him clear of the pack, that's all. Oh, there's a rumour going around that some of the jockeys have been paid to keep him boxed in on the rails. Look, Dave, if something's good, that's ok. But if something's too good, it upsets the whole system. Be careful? Ladies and gentlemen, for your information, the horses for the 13th race on the program are now in the walking ring. Now, listen to me closely. I want you to take him out to the front of the bunch right from the start, they're gonna try to box you in on the rails... He can't start fast, it'll put too much strain on the hoof. I said, he starts fast and that is an order. Alright, now don't forget, Billy. You take him out front, you take him out fast. Dave? Not now, not now, sir, please. Do me a favour. I'll talk to you later. Billy, hold him back at the start. Take him out wide and go right around the outside. Who's giving the orders round here, you or Davis? Me. Hold him back and take him wide. I'll have to cover a hell of a lot of extra ground. Billy, do what you're told. You'll get there. What if the hoof goes? Pull him up straight away. Ladies and gentlemen, the race you've all been waiting for, the Water Caliente Handicap, is next on the program. Alright, me old mate. Get out there and show 'em. The horses have reached the post. They're ready to start the Water Caliente Handicap. Good And Hot from the inside, with jockey Morgan, then Scimitar, Spanish Play, Reveille Boy is in post four, Bahamas with jockey John Longden starting from post position number five and the second choice this afternoon. Joe Flores is next, then comes Dr Freeland. Phar Lap is in post position number eight followed by Marine and Cabezo is on the outside. We're ready at the start of the Water Caliente Handicap. Marshall Cassidy ready to send this fine field of gentlemen on their way for a distance of 1.25 miles. Get ready, gentlemen. And go. And they're off. Phar Lap on the outside off slowly, that's Phar Lap last. And on the front end, there goes Joe Flores, charging up to take the lead as Johnny Longden moves Bahamas on the outside into second spot. Far back, Phar Lap is the trailer. Off slowly, pushing Phar Lap. I'll kill you, Woodcock. So help me God, I'll kill you. Joe Flores showing the way by half a length. Bahamas is in second spot... Hold him, Billy. Cabezo is next, with Reveille Boy between horses. Marine follows and after that it's Dr Freeland, Scimitar, Spanish Play and Phar Lap is the trailer. It looks like the Australian champion is not gonna run his race today. As the field moves to the clubhouse turn, Joe Flores on the inside... Alright, not yet. On the outside, Bahamas and Johnny Longden charging up to challenge early... Now. Now Reveille Boy finds room between horses for it. Cabezo is next, after that... Right round 'em, Bob. That's it. Scimitar, Spanish Play and Phar Lap on the outside begins to close round. There goes Phar Lap charging up on the outside. Bahamas on the inside now takes the lead... That's my Bobby boy. Phar Lap on the outside is flying. There goes Phar Lap. Phar Lap charging up quickly on the outside, Joe Flores is third, Reveille fourth... It's Phar Lap taking the lead. I've never seen a horse move so fast in two furlongs. On the inside, it's Joe Flores and Bahamas. Second spot, it's Reveille Boy moving between horses. It's Phar Lap showing the way by a length and a quarter... Whoa, that's the champion. It appears that he's faltering, jockey pulling up. - He's having trouble. - Watch behind ya. As Phar Lap is pulling up, Reveille Boy charges up on the outside now to take the lead. On the inside, it's Phar Lap, on the outside, Reveille Boy... Now take him home. Take him home. Reveille Boy on the outside, two horse race. Phar Lap on the inside, Reveille Boy on the outside and they're coming to the line, Phar Lap holds the lead... It's Phar Lap, the winner. Mr Telford? Mr Telford, can you have a few words with me about the tragedy? Leave me alone. Well, why is it, do you think, that there's been this incredible reaction to Phar Lap's death? After all, he was just a horse. He wasn't just a horse. He was the best.
