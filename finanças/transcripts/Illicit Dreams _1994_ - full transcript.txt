(dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) - Who are you? - Coffee. - God. - I waited till left the driveway. Oh, you didn't get any sleep, did you? - No. - Same dream? - Mm-hmm. I wish I could describe it to you, Min. It's always so sweet and there's somebody there, and then I'm so frightened at the end. - Of what? - I don't know. - Well, come on, get dressed, you gotta help me find an outfit for this museum benefit. - Okay. But I have to be back by three, 'cause Daniel gets home around (indistinct). - Moira, why do you put up with this shit? I can personally introduce you to three of the best divorce attorneys in town. They'll guarantee that you walk away with most of the money, and half the property. - It's not about money and property with Daniel. You don't just walk away from him. He hates to lose. - So he hates to lose, they all do. You deserve better than this, I wish you knew that. - Min, you don't know him like I do. - Thank God for that. Come on. - [Moira] It's getting awfully late, Min, what are we doing here? - [Mindy] This is the last stop. - [Moira] Uh-oh, what? - [Mindy] Promisee you won't scream? - [Moira] Okay, why? - [Mindy] I'm getting my cards read. - [Moira] Oh Mindy, please. - First the past. The empress, upside down. That probably has to do with your marital difficulties. You just had a set back. - Told you she was good. - Second, present. Ooh, the lover. - I like that. (dramatic music) What? - I'm sorry, I'm getting this incredible distraction. (dramatic music) - I'm gonna wait in the car. - Someone is looking for you, but there's a dark presence keeping you apart, and it frightens you. - Stop it, please. - You can't keep running from it. - I said stop it. - Moira. (dramatic music) What are you so upset about? She told you about the dream did she? - What did you tell her about me, Mind, that I had insomnia, nightmares, what? - No. I didn't even mention you, I swear. Look, here's her card, okay. She said to call her if you need anything. - Can we go now? - Yes. (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (dramatic music) - Turn around. - (indistinct) - Shh, just turn around. Just be quiet, don't make much noise. (Beverly moaning) (Mindy and Moira laughing) - Call me. (Beverly moaning) - Bye Min. (car horn honking) (Beverly moaning) (dramatic music) (Beverly moaning) (dramatic music) (Beverly moaning) - Just lay down here. - Harder. (dramatic music) (Beverly moaning) - Shh. (Beverly moaning) - You're so disgusting. (Beverly moaning) - Shh. - I gotta go. - No. - I gotta go. I gotta go. (dramatic music) (bird chirping) Moira. - What is it, Daniel? - Honey, could you please put some coffee on for Miss Keen and myself? - You want me to make coffee for your secretary? - I want you to make coffee for anyone I ask. My secretary takes care of my business affairs, you take care of the house. You'll serve coffee to the gardener if I ask. (gentle music) Moira, would you please bring me a cognac? - Here you are dear. - Thanks. Please, sit. - Okay. - How was your day today? - Fine. Did a little shopping with Melinda. - Did you buy something nice? - I found something I think you'll like. - Well that's good, you can wear it to Councilman Roger's party next week. - Fine. - I want to apologize about today. I realize I haven't spent much time with you lately, and I understand your jealousy towards all the time I've had to spend with my secretary. So your little emotional outburst is forgiven. Come here. (dramatic music) Come here. (dramatic music continues) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (thunder booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (phone ringing) - Don't you dare. - I gotta get it. Hello. - Reed, can you talk? - I'm a little busy right now, if you catch my drift. - I can't believe you answered the phone. - I'm sorry, man. I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay, bye. It's always something with that guy. - You're so insensitive. - Oh come on, Gina, where were we? - Gina? I don't think so. - Suzie? - There's no way I could have been undercut on that deal. I want that property. Now if someone in my organization is leaking information I wanna know who and I wanna know now. (glass shattering) I can't believe it, I lost the Philadelphia deal. - I'm sorry. - My coffee is cold. - I'll make some more. - With what? I'll get some on the way to the office. (gentle music) - Please help me, I'm going out of my mind. (knocking on door) - Yeah, just a minute. (knocking on door) Yeah, who is it? - Jesus, Nick, I've been knocking for 10 minutes, I thought you were in the shower or something. - Be right down. - Jesus, you look like shit. - Thanks. - What, did you party too much last night? - Nah, I just couldn't sleep. - Well take something, man, 'cause you're starting to look like the walking dead. - It's not like insomnia or anything, I mean I sleep, I just have these dreams. - I tell you it's that spicy Thai food, after 11:00 it'll kill you. Go wash your face. Hey, I left the key in your mailbox for that job off Ocean Park, did you find it? - Yeah, yeah, I got it somewhere. I checked out the house, it's not too bad. - I told the agent you'd call her today. If it was just a fix up I'd do it myself. The real estate lady says she wants the house on the market like yesterday. So I told her next me you're the best, a little strange but good. - Hey, thanks, pal, I owe you one. - That's all right. She left right after you called anyway. - Sorry about that too. - She wanted to talk. After midnight I don't wanna talk to nobody about nothing unless it's a 976 number. Figured if I turned out the light maybe I wouldn't see her mouth moving. The problem is I said "Look, Gina, I'm trying to concentrate here, "all this gabbing ain't helping." - Let me guess, your candor and your sensitivity didn't work, and she split. - Nah, it turns out her name ain't Gina. - You're a big Reed. - Well maybe but at least I sleep nights. Hey, let's go get some chow, 'cause you ain't got anything to eat here. Hey, that's what you need. - What? - A woman yapping at you for about an hour every night, it'll put you right to sleep man, I swear to God. (Nick laughing) (engine revving) (knocking on door) - Why did you say those things to me yesterday? How do you know about the dreams? - He's in your dreams? All right, come in. I feel it so strongly. There is someone there, he's looking for you. I don't know who or why, but you must feel it. - I feel like I know him. I know his touch. I know his face. I can feel him, but what does it mean? - I can't answer your questions unless I give you a reading, and you don't believe in that. - Please, Cicily, I feel like I'm going crazy. - All right. I'll need an object, do you have something personal? - How about this? - That's fine. (dramatic music) - What? - Where did that come from? - He gave it to me last night in the dream. - Psychokinetic teleportation. (dramatic music) Oh he loves you. He loves you so much. - I feel like I love him too. I, I can't have him though, he's not real. - Yes he is real. He's the missing part of your life that so desperately needs to be found. It's a love that has transcended heaven and Earth and materialized in the palm of your hand. - You're scaring me. - There's something else, Moira. For as much as your fate wants to bring you together there's a dark, evil power determined to keep you apart. - I don't wanna hear anymore of this. I never should have come here. - I know you're afraid, but you must help him try to find you. If you don't, Moira, it'll never be finished, never. (gentle music) - May I help you? - Hi, just one, please. - Right this way. - No, no, it's a great piece of property. - So how much is that lady paying for the fix up? - Same as always, 150 a day plus materials. Why don't you give her a call, tell her you'll take the job. You know you need the money, you ain't worked in weeks. Maybe you can get her to come up a little bit, you know, if you catch my drift. - You're unbelievable. - What are you talking about? She ain't a bad looking broad for a woman her age. - I don't even know how I spend time with you. (dramatic music) - Hi good morning, could I get you something to drink? - Just coffee, thanks. - Okay, I'll be right back. (dramatic music) - What she say? - There's no answer. Look, I gotta go to the marina, I'll give her a call from there. - All right. (dramatic music) - [Waiter] Here you go, ma'am, here's your coffee. Do you take cream and sugar with that? - [Moira] Do you have any sweetener? - Of course. There you go. Are you ready to order now? - Just give me a minute. - Excuse me, ma'am, are you feeling okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (dramatic music) - Hey Nick, what is it this week? - I had to add some rot lights, back stays in case of rough water. - You're not gonna see much rough water tied up to that dock. - Did you come down here to bust my chops, Ned, or did you come here for a reason? - Rent on the slip's due again. - Look, I'll have to pay you in a couple weeks ago, okay? I just got a house unbelievable nearby, in fact I gotta go call the real estate lady right now. Say, you got a quarter? - Get out. Here. - Thanks. - I'll add it to your bill. - Hi, Marion. - Hi Nick Bridges. - Nice to meet you. - I'm really sorry, Reed gave me a key, but I must have misplaced it somewhere. - Oh, that's all right, I have a backdoor key with me. There are holes that need to be patched and plastered all through the house, everything needs paint. Oh, this banister is loose, it needs some work. And there's water damage to the master bedroom ceiling upstairs, follow me. Come on, I won't bite you. (dramatic music) - Oh my God, that's it. (dramatic music continues) - Out here the rain gutters have blown down, and I want you to check the shutters out, please. Come on, I'll show you the downstairs. (knocking on door) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) The kitchen needs a lot of cosmetic work, but it's in pretty good shape, you know? Speaking of pretty good shape, you work out? - Uh, no, not much. (dramatic music) - Well I'd really like to start showing the house soon, so do what you can to spruce the place up, and I will be a very happy woman. (dramatic music) Something wrong? - No. I'm sorry. Everything seems great. I'd say a week, maybe two at the most. - Great, I'll come by in a couple of days to check out the progress. And if you need anything at all, just give me a call okay? (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Moira. - Oh, Daniel, hi. - You seem nervous. Did I frighten you? - No, I just didn't expect you to be here that's all. - You're late, where were you? - Well I had met Mindy for lunch, and then we took in a new exhibit at the Fourth Street Gallery. - Ah, did you like it? - It's not really my cup of tea, I, oh. - If you're gonna lie, Moira, you better learn to do a better job. Melinda called here asking for you. You know, if I didn't know any better, I would think that you were seeing someone. Pick up the fucking mail. (Moira crying) I have a business dinner tonight, when you and I get back, you and I are gonna have a very clear discussion of what's expected of you. (gentle music) I have another job for you. No. I want you to follow my wife. I wanna know where she goes, who she sees, how long she stays. Right. I wanna know if she's having an affair, and if she is I want details. (gentle music continues) - I wish you'd tell me when you're gonna use me as an excuse, Moira. God, I feel terrible. - No, no, it's okay. I should have been thinking faster. I should have been home on time. - Don't be crazy. I'm calling my lawyer. - Forget it, Mindy. - If this isn't sufficient grounds for divorce, I don't know what is. - You don't divorce a man like Daniel, he'd make sure I ended up with nothing. - So what? At least you'd still have your self respect. - I'm not gonna get far on self respect, am I? - Moira, if he won't give you a fair divorce, then humiliate him into it. - Yeah, how? - You told me yourself he's screwing his secretary under this very roof, and there's gotta be a way to turn that around, and make it work for you. - Mindy, you're talking about a man who socializes with judges and politicians, it's my word against his, and whoever he's throwing a campaign contribution to. - You know as well as I do the minute something starts to stink bad enough judges and politicians are the first ones off this band wagon. - Do you have any idea what you're suggesting I do? - I'm suggesting blackmail, extortion, incrimination. Humiliation is the one thing a man like Daniel cannot deal with. - You know there was a time when I really thought I loved him, thought he would take such good care of me. How could I have been that wrong? I need some air. - Honey, you know there is no real Mr. Right. Any relationship is good for a few years at best, then you get what you can out of it, and you move on. - Do you really believe that? - I'm living proof of that. Three ex husbands, and I loved all of them, for a few months anyway. - Don't you think that there's someone out there for everyone? Someone you could spend the rest of your life with? - No. - You're full of it. Melinda Taft, Vaneggers and Ryan, otherwise you wouldn't be seeing a fortune teller. (gentle music) - Hey Nick, Nick, where are you? - Yeah? - Come on down, I got a surprise for you. Hey Nick, this is Fawn, her friend Vicki. Fawn, Nick, Nick, Vicki. - Hi. Reed, what are you doing? - It turns out Fawn and I were gonna go catch that new French film at the Royale, and her friend Vicki here had nothing to do. - You were gonna catch a French film? - Yeah. - Oh, I just love foreign films, they're so artistic. - Yeah, me too. - So there I am standing in front of the theater with two of the prettiest girls in town, thinking to myself "What a shame?" - You thought that to yourself, did you? - Yeah, to myself. - Great place, Nick. - Thanks. - I thought what a shame that my friend Nick is sitting home alone. - You are gonna love my friend Vicki. She's very smart. She's into art and stuff like that, but she's a little shy. - Can you excuse me for just a second? - Sure. - Reed, what the hell are you doing? I am not in the mood for this tonight. - I know that, Nick, you're never in the mood anymore, so I'm doing you a favor. I'm taking your mind, whatever's left of it, off of whatever it is that's bothering you, and putting it back where it belongs. So lighten up and enjoy the party, pal. Okay, come on, let's have a toast here. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - You know, I really have to get going. Fawn. - What? - Now. - Yeah, sure, I'll take you. - It was really nice to meet you, Nick. Don't get up. - You know, we should really do this again sometime. How about we go to that new film at the Royale next week? It'll be fabulous. - Maybe Nick'll feel better by then. - After you drop them off, why don't you come back by? - Come back by? If I get real lucky tonight I might get lucky to night. If I get really lucky tonight, you catch my drift. - I just don't wanna be alone tonight, okay? - Alone? What the hell is wrong with you, Nick? You've been alone all night. Even if I get turned down on both accounts, why would I wanna come back here? I'll go find a dark bar and get drunk or something because you my friend have become a real drag. You don't wanna talk about it, you don't want anybody's help, you just sit around and pine over drawings of some fantasy dream lady, and you're starting to depress me. And if you know me at all you know that this is all I am, and I can't afford to be where you are. (gentle music) (dramatic music) (clock tolling) (gentle music) (intense music) (gentle music) - This isn't just a dream, I know it. - Well, well, well. It's 3:00 in the morning, and you're still up. Waiting to have our little conversation? - Daniel, you've had a bit to drink, don't you think this could wait til morning? - What would you do be doing up at this hour? You don't wanna talk, you don't wanna sleep, what is it that you want, Moira? You wanna walk around in a haze? You're disrespectful, you're evasive, and now you've become a liar too. You know, I don't understand you. I have given everything any woman could possibly want, and you have nothing to do all day except take care of the house, and you know what? You have managed to neglect that too. - Daniel, if you don't like the way I keep your house, why don't you hire a house keeper? - Don't you tell me what to do. I will not have a stranger in my house, touching my personal things, do you hear me? I ask you to do one thing, one thing, and you can't even get that right. - Daniel, please. - Shut the fuck up when I'm talking. Do you hear me? You're gonna clean, and then you're gonna clean some more, you hear me? And you're gonna clean because if you can't sleep then you're gonna clean all night every night, do you hear me? - Daniel, just stop. - Shut the fuck up and clean. (dramatic music) You'll clean, do you understand? You'll clean until you understand how much I have given you, and how much I can takeaway. Clean. (gentle music) (Moira crying) - [TV] Beautiful cubic zirconia ring that I personally have ever seen, ever seen look at this cut. Look at the clarity in that ring, it's magnificent. This is a solitary cut, cubic zirconia ring. Two carrots, two carrots, and no one will ever know. Now, ladies and gentleman, we only have 15 rings. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hey, Reed, hope it's not too late, man, hope I'm not interrupting anything. - Nick? It's 3:00 in the morning, what's the matter, what are you doing up at this hour? - Well I watched the Home Shopping Network for a couple hours, and cleaned out the fridge. - That is truly the most pathetic thing I have ever heard. Nick, do me a favor, would you? Get a life. - I just wanted to call, and say I'm sorry for acting so weird. - I know, I know, it's okay man. - I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? - Yeah, yeah. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'll give you a call tomorrow. - [TV] We're down to 10 rings, this is your last chance. (gentle music) if you want the most beautiful rings you've ever seen in your life, you gotta call right now. (gentle music continues) - [Daniel] Moira. - Mr. Davis. - Morning Mark. Moira. This coffee's cold. Have you seen my wife? - [Mark] No, sir. - All right, come on, let's go, I'll call her from the office. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Mindy, can you come over right now? I wanna divorce Daniel. - Moira. (gentle music) Moira, I got here as fast as I could. Hey, what did he do to you? - I need a divorce, Mindy. I don't know who else to call. - Well it's about time. Okay, what we need is a plan. - I just wanna scratch his eyes out. - That's a good plan. - I need to find a way to make him let go. And then I wanna be far, far away from him. - Hey, hey, don't cry. You're gonna make me cry. Look, you're doing the right thing, you gotta fight back. - I'm scared. - I know, it's okay. It's okay. Come on, sweetie, let's get you dressed. (gentle music) - I don't like being in here, Mindy. - Relax, you said he was in Lancaster. - Well I never believe a word he says. - It'll just take a minute. Okay. It's voice activated. With this little transmitter everything Daniel D. Davis says will be recorded, both sides. Maybe we can catch him and his secretary in the act. Wish we had a video camera. - Where'd you get all this stuff? - Oh, my ex-husband, he used to record his conversations. - He was an attorney for god's sake. - I know. The Rolls-Royce and the house in Carmel. - How can a wife do this to her husband? - How can a husband humiliate and abuse his wife on a daily basis? You're not doing anything to him, you're just getting it on tape. - You know, you're much too good at this, it's frightening. - Hey. Find anything interesting there? - No, you get the same junk mail I do. How's that job going? You're home a little early, aren't you? - If you really wanna know, I had lunch at the coffee house, I picked up some new rain gutters, and I came home. - You mutinous dog. You don't take this job very seriously, do you? My ass is kind of on the line here. - Reed I'll get the job done, okay? Don't worry about it. My head's just not in it today. - Well that's just it, Nick, your head's not into anything lately. Even that boat of yours. Why don't you just go do whatever it is you wanna do? Go save a whale or something, whatever. Make a change, man. If this lake ain't working for you, pick another one. I'm not smart like you are, Nick, if I had half the education you have, and knew one tenth the things that are in your head, I'd go do something great. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - Cicily, what did you mean when you said it would never be finished? - Well, it's like anything else in life, Moira, you can't run away from your problems, you have to face them and take action. - You think I'm doing this to myself? - No. But you are allowing it to happen. You have the power to change the direction of your life, but you must have the courage to do it. Sometimes it's good to take inventory, and sweet out the things we don't need, and make room for something else. - You're right, I know you're right. Thank you. - I'm always here for you, my dear. (gentle music) (intense gentle music) - Moira. - [Moira] I'm in here, honey. I hope you're hungry. - Oh, honey, look at this. This is beautiful, but I'm afraid I've gotta go to Philadelphia on business right away. - I'm sorry about last night. - That's my girl. I promise you as soon as I get back we'll do something special. Okay. I'm gonna go pack. (gentle music) (fire crackling) (clock tolling) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (sensual music) (thunder booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (gentle music) (knocking on door) (dramatic music) (nail gun firing) (nail gun firing) - Hello. Excuse me. I'll get it. - No, no, it's okay, I got it. - I didn't mean to frighten you. I wonder if you could tell me who owns this house. - It's you. - How do you know me? - You wouldn't believe me. - I think I would. I have to go. - No, wait. Come on, please, don't go. - I don't know you. - My name's Nick, Nick Richardson. I dream about you. (gentle music) You do know me, don't you? - Yeah. I don't understand how this can be happening. I need some time to think about it. - I don't even know your name. - It's Moira. - Don't just walk away, promise me you'll come back. - I can't, I'm married. - Then at least meet me somewhere so we can talk, so we can try and understand all this. Don't just walk away from me, please. I have to go to the marina tomorrow, there's a little park by the boat slips, meet me there. (gentle music) - I'll try. (gentle music continues) - Moira. Hey, what happened to you, I thought we were gonna celebrate Mr. Davis' unscheduled departure. - I was out. - Well I know you were out. What's wrong with you? You're as nervous as a cat. How much caffeine have you had today? - Mindy, I met someone. - What? - I met someone. - Excuse me? I heard what you said, I guess I just must have missed something here. You're saying to me between yesterday and today while driving around in your car you just happened to meet someone? Have you been seeing someone all along? - No, no, I haven't, I swear I just met him by accident. - Well but kind of bait are you using, honey, 'cause they ain't biting on what I'm fishing with. - Listen, it's a little more complicated than that, Mindy. I have to meet him at the marina tomorrow. - Well, so what, you want a ride or something? What is so complicated about this? I mean you're married to a man that's an asshole, you're having an affair with one that's not, you tell him he's impeccable. - Mindy, please. - What's his name? - His name's Nick. - Nick. That's a nice name. What's he do? - I don't know. I think he's a carpenter or something. - Interesting, interesting. How's he in bed? - Melinda. - What? - I just met him. I'm so nervous. - What are you nervous about? Moira, you deserve to be happy, whether you realize it or not. I need a drink. And I am not gonna sit here, and watch you let this guy slip through your fingers. Either that or give me the address, and I'll go meet him. - Mind? - Yes? - Does this mean you think I should go? - Ugh, are you crazy? Yes. (Moira and Melinda laughing) (gentle music) - I didn't think you'd come. I didn't know how to find you. - I wasn't sure I should. - Do you believe in fate? Destiny? - I didn't think I did. I can't explain this. - I think I've dreamed about you all my life. When I was a little kid, I used to think that everybody dreamed about someone. The past few months you've been in my sleep every night. I thought I was going crazy. - I know what you mean. - I can't believe you're actually here. Come on, I wanna show you something. This is it. - That's your boat? - It's my mistress. 40-foot catch double ender. - It's beautiful. - Thanks. - I've never been on a boat before. - (indistinct) Well you either love it or you hate it. I've been rebuilding it for the past two years. She was originally builtin 1938, and I redesigned the spar and the rigging myself, and then I rebuilt and realigned the haul so that- - Wait, wait, wait. I have no idea what that means. - I'm sorry, I guess I get a little carried away sometimes. - That's all right, don't be sorry. It's nice to see someone with passion about something they love. - I love the sea, I always have. You know, I've always had this fantasy about just sailing away to Fiji or Bora Bora. I don't know, just leaving and never coming back. - So why didn't you? - I don't know. I'm not brave enough, I guess. - I've always felt like I've been waiting for something too. I suppose that's just an excuse for being a coward. - You don't have anything to be afraid of. So you wanna take her out? - You mean right now? - Sure, why not? Hey, come on, let's see if you love to sail. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continuing) (gentle music continuing) So how do you like sailing? - I love it. I wanna see where you live. - Okay. (gentle music) This place is a mess. - It's okay. - Look, make yourself comfortable. I'll be right back, I'm sorry. - Mind if I come up? - Sure, if you don't mind the mess. - You drew these? - Yeah. - Wonderful. - Thanks. Don't look at that. - Is that me? - Sort of. Hey, look, come on. (gentle music) This is my favorite time of day. - Nick, it's beautiful. - You're beautiful. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continuing) You hungry? - No. - Cold? - A little. - Come on. (gentle music) You don't have to do anything you don't wanna do. - I know. I wanna do everything with you. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continuing) (gentle music continuing) (dramatic music) - [Moira] I have to go. - Meet me tomorrow. - Where? - There's a little coffee shop on Sevio, let's say noon. - I know it. Okay. - I'll walk you down. - Nuh-uh. I'll see you tomorrow. Look so warm and cozy, I wanna remember you like this. - Moira. Am I late? - No, I'm early. - No, I was early, I was walking around the block for half an hour trying to kill time. Is something wrong? - No. I'm nervous. This is all so overwhelming. I'm not sure I understand any of this. - I don't understand it either. Nothing's ever felt this right for me. That sounded pretty silly didn't it? - I just need a little time to let this all sink in. - Just tell me I'm not dreaming this. - You're not. You have to get back to work, and I have an appointment. - Meet me tonight. Come to my house, or I'll come to you. - No, that's not possible. - Promise you'll come. Every time you leave, I get scared. Promise me. - All right. I promise. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - You're sure about this? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Mr. Davis. (dramatic music) - I want you to stay on the case. - Yes, sir, I will. - I wanna know who he is. - Daniel, hi. - Hi, honey. - I'm sorry dinner is late, I'll have it ready as soon as I can. - Oh, that's okay. Dinner can wait. I think I deserve a proper welcome home. (dramatic music) - Ow, Daniel, don't. Stop, you're hurting me. - Shut up and get upstairs. You shut up. You're always wining about something. You just stop it, just stop it. How am I supposed to believe you? You know, if you weren't such a liar, I wouldn't have to do this to you. But you're a liar. Liar. Liar. Liar. Liar. A liar. A liar. (dramatic music) (Moira crying) (dramatic music continues) (knocking on door) - Hey, come on in. - I'm sorry, Nick, I can't stay. - Moira, what's the matter? - I can't come here anymore. - What is it? - I mean I can't see you anymore, not now, it's too complicated. - Don't say that, Moira, don't even say it. - Look, if my husband finds out, he's not gonna just let me go. He's not gonna let this happen. - Look at me. Look at me and tell me you don't feel exactly the same way I do. - It's not about feelings right now. It's more complicated than that. I'd die if anything happened to you. - Moira. (dramatic music) - I can't take it anymore, Mindy. Every minute in this house is like another minute off my life. I gotta find a way to get him into that office and get the tape. There's gotta be some shred, some word of misbehavior. (dramatic music) - Moira. - Okay, I gotta go, he's waiting for me downstairs. We'll be at Councilman Rodger's party. Okay, bye. - [Daniel] We're late. - I'm ready. - Well don't you look beautiful in your very green dress. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I had a problem come up, there was a labor dispute, and I'm gonna have to meet you at the party. - Daniel, you know I don't like to go to these things alone. - Come on, Moira, you won't be alone at all, your gold digging friend Melinda will be there, drinking and flirting, and looking for another wealthy husband, I'm sure. - Moira, look, this party is very important to the councilman. Now he needs to know that he has our support, so when you get there I want you to explain why I'm late. I'll be there as soon as I can. (dramatic music) Drive carefully. - Mr. Davis. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - You look great. I'm sorry to ask you to come over so late, it's just that, well, I wanted to see you. - You look wonderful in a tuxedo. - Here, let me take that for you. - Thank you. So, where's Mrs. Davis? - Oh, she's at a party. I'm gonna meet up with her a little later. - Ah, we're safe. (dramatic music) (Beverly laughing) What are you doing? - Afraid are you? Well you should be. You know when I was in Philadelphia last week some very vital information about my company mysteriously leaked into the hands of a competitor, and I lost a very, very big deal. Now I don't like that, and there are files missing from my office. - I didn't take them. - Don't lie to me. - [Beverly] I didn't take them. - [Daniel] Don't lie to me. (Beverly crying) You know, you are a very pretty girl, Miss Keen, and I have enjoyed fucking you very much, but if I don't have those files back by tomorrow morning, you're not gonna be so pretty anymore. Now do you understand me? Do you understand me? - I understand. - Huh? Now get out of here. (dramatic music) - My God. (gentle music) - [Investigator] An independent contractor by the name of Nicholas Richardson. She spent the afternoon with him on his boat, and that evening they were in his residence at 19 Beach Walk. There's more, but mostly the same. - [Daniel] Are you sure about this? - [Investigator] Yes, sir, Mr. Davis, I'm sorry. - [Daniel] Stan. - My God. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (dramatic music) (Moira screaming) - Whoa, take it easy. I just came by to see if I could get the tape recorder. - I gotta get out of here right now, Min. - What's going on? - Daniel came in while I was looking for the tape so I hid behind the bar. He was with his secretary, Beverly. Min, he threatened to kill her for betraying him. - God, he found the tape? - You don't understand, I heard part of the tape, he had me followed. He knows about Nick. He knows about everything. And he knows that I betrayed him. - Do you have the tape? - It's in the side pocket of the bag. I gotta get out of here before he realizes I'm not at the party, he's gonna come looking for me. - No. If he's had you followed, chances are somebody's still following you. - Oh my God, and they know I'm here. - Listen, this is what we're gonna do. I want you to get in your car, go to Cicily's down by the beach, okay? - They'll just follow us. - That's okay. They can only follow one of us at a time, this'll work, trust me. - Min. - Here, come on. - God. - Don't lose that tape. - I won't, come on. (dramatic music) - Are you all right? - You tell me. I knew I was never gonna be able to get away from this man. - You can and you will. - I don't have the courage. I'm not strong enough. - You can remain a victim or not. You have a choice. Make it. - Oh God. - Sorry guys. You're never gonna believe what else is on this tape. Daniel and Congressman Murphy are involved in some kind of land fraud or something. They're falsifying documents. Anyway, the files are missing, somebody got wind of it. If we can get those files, Moira, you wouldn't have to be afraid anymore. This could put him away. - I can do it. I can get the files. - Good. Give me your keys, give me your jacket. We'll switch cars. By the time they figure out what's going on you'll have time to get to a hotel, and register under a different name. - I have someplace to go where I'll be safe. Look, I'll call you. - Be careful. - Mind. - Oh, that would be helpful. - You were right, he was a missing part of my life, and I found him. Thank you. - It'll soon be all finished. (dramatic music) - Moira? (dramatic music) Moira? (dramatic music continues) Moira? Moira? Moira, where the hell are you? (dramatic music) Son of a bitch. Moira? (dramatic music continues) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Where's my wife? - I'm tailing her right now. As soon as she lands somewhere I'll give you a call, Mr. Davis. - You do that. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Beverly Keen, this is Moira Davis. Please don't hang up, I need to talk to you about my husband. I know what he did to you. I wanna help you, and you can help me. - I can't talk to you on the phone. - Well then meet me. Listen, I know you have no reason to trust me, but your life is in danger because of those files. Please. - Where? - At a house that's being renovated. 1734 Seaview, by the marina. And please bring the files. - All right, fine. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Mr. Davis, I followed your wife's car all over the place. She pulled into Melinda Ryan's driveway, but when I got close it wasn't your wife, it was Miss Ryan. They must have switched cars. I'm sorry, Mr. Davis. - You're sorry? You don't know what sorry is. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (phone ringing) - Pick up. - [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Nick. - Nick. - [Answering Machine] I'm not in right now. If you leave your name and number at the sound of the tone, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Nick, it's me, Moira. I'm so sorry, Nick. I'm so sorry. My husband, he's crazy, Nick, he had us followed. (banging on door) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - [Moira] He'll be looking for me, and I know he'll come there, Nick. I'm somewhere where he can't find me, and soon, very soon all of this will be over. Nick, I do love you. Don't give up on us, okay? - Nick? What the hell happened? Nick? Anybody here? (dramatic music) What's with the door, man? - Son of a bitch, where's my wife? - I don't know what you're talking about, I swear. I didn't know she was married, I swear it. - You dumb fuck. Now you got three seconds to tell me where my wife is, or I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out. - I don't know who your wife is, I swear to God. - Really? Well then how do you explain the love message on your machine? - It ain't me. This ain't my house. I'm just looking for my friend, Nick. - Nick? - Yeah. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - Reed? Reed? Reed? - You better get the number of that truck? - What the hell happened? - I don't know, he came after me from behind, some psycho thought I was you. That's funny, huh? - I'll get you some ice. - I hope this broad is worth it. Next time tell your girlfriend not to leave a kiss and tell message on the answering machine. - She left a message? - Yeah. - [Moira] He'll be looking for me, and I know he'll come there, Nick. I'm somewhere where he can't find me, and soon, very soon all this will be over. Nick, I do love you, don't give up on us okay. - She's in trouble. You gonna be okay? I can't just sit here, I gotta find her. - How? - I don't know. I gotta try. - Be careful. (gentle music) - Hello Melinda. - I knew you'd show up sooner or later. - Oh, I bet you did. Where's my wife? - I don't know. - You did this, didn't you? You put these ideas into her head, you talked her into leaving me, didn't you? - No, you did, I just helped her. Good shot. Is that how you hit, Moira? - [Daniel] Shut up. - [Congressman Murphy] You assured me this wouldn't be a problem. How how'd they get that information, Davis? You better get to the bottom of this fast. I promise you if my name is linked to this in any way... - [Daniel] That will not happen, Congressman Murphy, if you'll just hear me out. - [Congressman Murphy] Just take care of it. - Where did you get that? - I bugged your office. - They can't prove anything with that. - Oh, yes I can. I made lots of copies, and sent 'em out all over town. Now it's your turn to be humiliated, you self obsessed son of a bitch. - I'll kill you. (knocking on door) - Door's open. - [Man] Melinda. Melinda, where are you? I got here as fast as I could. (gentle music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (gentle music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (thunder booming) (gentle music) - Oh my God. (dramatic music) - I'm very disappointed in you, Moira. (Moira screaming) (Moira coughing) (dramatic music) (Daniel groaning) (Moira screaming) (dramatic music) - You're dead. (nail gun firing) (gentle music) - You okay? It's over. It's all over. - Don't ever let me go, Nick. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - What's the matter honey, having a bad dream? How about some coffee? (dramatic music)
