To walk towards that sad voice calling me. To face Zinar. Isn't that why I'm not writing anyway? İnsan bu dünyadaki acıyı nereye koymalı? Acılarımızı saklayacak bir yer var mı? Yeterince kuyu, ev, dükkân. Sanırım yok. İyi misin? İyi misin? [kalabalık] Direne direne kazanacağız! Direne direne kazanacağız!

You were saying that I will go to a Gabar, I will finish the novel there, what happened? I'm thinking of going over the weekend, let's see. There are some gaps, if I can remember them, If I can fill in the blanks, maybe I'll finish the novel huh. Will I be able to remember what I forgot after the surgery? Maybe. But of course, the operation must be successful first. What if it's not successful? [breathing sound] That the surgery is a risky surgery We talked to you, Ahmet. That's how I remember it. Risk, risk of death. All your surgeries. [horn sound] How much time do I have? -[horn sound] -[breathing sound] [doctor] One, two months. Maybe a little more. Good. Good. [Ahmet inner voice] O product, blood in my brain, that little pea of ​​pus and cartilage. It now has a name. The face of fate. My death will not be a gray-haired death. This is everything.

Don't weigh your load. [coughing sound] [sad music] [wind howling] [door knocks] [Marilyn] Ahmet brother. [door knocks] -I came. -[Marilyn] Ahmet brother. [whistle sounds from outside] [door knocks] [Marilyn] Ahmet brother. [Ahmet] Where is your key? Ahmed brother. Friends with Serap sister, Cengiz sister. Can they rest with you for a few hours? No, there are 12 people downstairs with me, but we haven't slept for 24 hours. [breathing sounds] I am so hungry. [Marilyn] Love it bro, you didn't eat anything. What happened, didn't you like it? I ate out all the time these days. No more cooking for you, but huh. It's a shame these will go to waste. Well, Cengiz, can you clear the table? Serap sister, can you help too? [Mirage] Okay. Look here. Look, this girl doesn't look at you at all. [Marilyn] She's not feeding or tidying up. But wait, I'll have a talk with him, I'll pull him aside. What was her name, Was it Ayşin or Asil? Oh, what a boxing name. I will talk to him. I'm working, Marilyn. Of course, you can work if you get the opportunity from your wife. I'm not saying anything. [voices of protest from the street] Look at me. How are you, are you okay? Staple. [Marilyn] Do you eat too, bro? No, I'm having my breakfast. My brother writes. He writes stories, he writes screenplays, he also writes poetry. Serap sister is also a teacher at the university. Cengiz is also a thesis student. We are together every day in Gezi. -So you write. Let's say I'm eager to write. He has completed three notebooks so far. Will finish soon. Doesn't he look like Namık Kemal anyway? By God, I think he looks like brother Marx. After all, this beard business is often an effort to change oneself, isn't it? [siren sounds] Look, there's a scar over there, see? Look like this. It goes from under my beard to my lips like this. Did you see? With such seasonal changes, Here's the temperature, the color changes when the light changes. It's pink, it's purple. 9.75 square centimeters. Face measurement. I know, because they measured it three times in the military delegation. That's why I didn't become a commando. So if it was 0.26 square centimeters larger, or if the doctor measuring it understood a little more geometry or look, if he took these things into account, these channels are here, there are such slits, if he had taken them into account I would not do military service. But it didn't. -Did you do your military service? -No. I was a second lieutenant. So I was an officer. Then you wake up every morning, in front of the mirror. you are shaving. Then the military service ended, So I thought my wound was standing in too much sunlight, I grew a beard like this, did some hair, etc. So it is. My wound went underground. I never thought of Namık Kemal or Karl Marx. But look, I was thinking of only one thing, huh. To look eye to eye when I talk to people like this. Because when I didn't have a beard, people were always talking here, here, here. Could I explain? [silence] A long and dramatic tirade. Yup, A tirade that I love to throw when appropriate. [Cengiz] Brother, you misunderstood me, I didn't mean anything like that. I'm sorry. -We disturbed you, we know. -No, astaghfurullah. -Is your wound congenital? -It is considered. [skirmish sounds from the street] [crowd] By resisting, we will win! [running sounds] [siren sound] -Brother, are you dating? -[Ahmet] I'll work later. You can stay here as long as you want. But slam the door on your way out, because it won't close. Also, Don't touch my drink, so there's a grocery store downstairs if you feel like it. Have a nice day. [door closes] [crowd] Come on! Come here! -[male] Four, five, six, seven, -[breathing sounds] - eight, nine, ten. -[screams] One two Three, four, five, six, seven, - eight, nine, ten. -What are you doing, goat? My commander. And you… Lan, rahat. Commander, I'm bringing you a cup of rabbit blood tea right away. No, he doesn't. Let's go out. Let's have a drink. -No, commander. Is there a problem? -No problem. Marilyn brought a lot of people home, it turned into a refugee tent. There was no place to take a step, that's why I say. [male] four, -What happened? -five. You're going to want your money, aren't you, brother? I'm not asking for money, let's go. oh my god. My commander. I swear I've never seen a man like you in my life. -Lan, it's comfortable. -[counting sound] I'm comfortable like this. Look, I'm leaving on one condition, I'm buying the drinks. Okay okay. We're out of debt. [male] Seven, eight, nine, ten. [coughing sound] I'm a scoundrel bro. God damn shame on me. What happened man? [siren sound] I love a girl. Good job. So it's been almost six months. I'm secretly saving money so we can get married. I didn't say anything to anyone. Look, I'm just telling you, even to you. Offended with my moms, they don't know shit anyway. All right, son, get married. I get out of the house. I'll find a place to stay, don't worry. What's up, commander? I will pay you my debt So I'm going to spend the money on the wedding. Damn goat, aren't you my heir? Let's say something happened to me, I'm in, whose will it be? You and Marilyn. Who else do I have? Commander, that's the problem. Marilyn I will pay you my debt, you will give the money to him, he will also cut his tawba estağfurullah, something like that. Look at what you're thinking. My son just got his Adam's apple, Marilyn. OK. Let the pixie wait a bit. -Isn't it, commander? -[Ahmet] So wait a bit. -Oh… -Stop, stop, stop, stop. -Stop. -OK. -Commander, say whatever you want from me. -Oh. Look, I swear, I'm really serious, what do you wish from me right now, what? -All right, I wish. -Yup. OK. You're going to whine soon, don't whine okay? -No, I won't cry. -Lan, that's my only wish. -Brother, you ask me. -Son, I'm serious, I'm telling you. -I'm serious too. -OK. Allah Allah. Do you want a handkerchief? [carer] Families will be arriving soon. Such a master, the wise one among you, He will choose the good ones and take them home. They do not choose the one who speaks or the one who weeps. Let me tell you, those who talk like that, who talk too much, stay here. The rest of you will live here with us, okay. [crow voice] [dropping sound] - Hussein. -[kids] Hussein. Quiet, quiet. Hussein, my son, what's wrong with you? -[boy] He passed out. -No, nothing, okay, nothing. -Hang on here. Hussein. -[Ahmet] When the orphans die They would throw it into the cadaver pool. Did you know? We thought they threw Hussein there too. It turns out For weeks, I dreamed of Hüseyin swimming on his back like that in the pool. His eyes are open. Hussein was looking at me. Commander. Who is Hussein? [ringing sound] [sitter] Get up, wake up, come on. Come on, it's morning, come on, get up. Come on, wake up. Look, breakfast is gone, after that I'm hungry, I don't understand. You will go to bed early, you will wake up early, wake up. Get down. Ahmet. Get up. get up. Wake up. Hussein. Hussein, come on son, wake up. Hussein. Get up, son. My son, get up, get up, get up! Get up, wake up. Are we going to deal with you? Get up. Wake up, wake up. Wake up son, wake up. -[drop sound] -[silence] [Ahmet] Hussein died in his bed one morning. Moreover, he was beaten for five minutes by the caregiver, who did not realize that he was dead. [Emotional music] [Ahmet] The day Hussein died We traveled between Basmane and Şemikler by train six times. A journey for Hüseyin's age. Hüseyin loved trains. Never got on. [sigh sound] Damn, we couldn't even get the kid on the train once. -Brother, we got drunk, let's get up. -Happy. A boy appeared before us in the village at the foot of Gabar Mountain. His name is Zinar. He was six and a half, seven years old. He was going to be a director when he grew up. You remember, right? [seagull voice] -[Mesut] Brother, let's get up. -You were going to bring me a guy. Was he from the special forces, who was there that night, what was his name? -[Mesut] Honor. -Honor. [Mesut] Honor. I'll bring it, brother. Let's get up. When will you bring it? [Mesut] Commander, I'm waiting for news, it will come in a few days. Mesut, when will you bring it? [Mesut] Commander, I'll bring it to you, I'm waiting for news. Come on, we're high. Let's get up. OK. But you will. [Mesut] Promise. Come on bro. Ah! [Ahmet] Aysin. Did you have the key? [breathing sound] I'm so drunk. I drank some. I am very happy though. I am so happy. [sigh sound] [breakfast sounds] I took your top off last night. [floor creaking] [cry of understanding] There is no aysin. There is no aysin. The seat was very uncomfortable. When Marilyn said that Ahmet brother would not come, I went to bed. And then you came and kissed my neck. Then I went back to the living room. My dear, you have occupied Taksim, it was not enough, You have come, you are occupying my bedroom. -Where will I sleep? -I poured you tea. I dont use. I don't use sugar. OK. I went through your books a little bit last night. -Is that so? -Seeing Schoendoerffer -I couldn't stand it. -There is little, not much. No, I have them all. If you want, I can bring it to you. How, there are quite a few. But I will take it back. So to read, let me tell you. It happens, it happens. [sniffing sound] And you were delirious last night? -I'm delirious? -Uh huh. You talked about your sins. You have big sins. Get out of the cabin, Father. I have nothing to confess. When there are sinners around, the costs are high. [significant] Hmm? Let me guess, you sure have one dog. So you feed stray cats or something, You put water or something like this, containers, maps. You are getting on the ferry. You throw bagels at the seagulls like that in the back, right? -Well? -Well This is how you calm yourself down. -Sinners, cats, dogs, birds. -Is that so? I'm not one of them, but let me tell you. But you are sad. -Am I so? -Yup. -Arent you? -I do not know. Look, I'm trying to be friendly. I apologize for the sensitivity of my nose. Unfortunately, I can smell the sadness even from afar. Koku. Sweat and alcohol. It's just my scent. I am disturbing you. I'm sorry, I'll go. Sorry. OK, I'm sorry. well I'm so used to having breakfast with Marilyn, it felt weird. Sorry. I love cats, birds, dogs and sinners. Come on. Please. Thank you. So it's always been… …them… … they looked me in the eye. Always. For that reason. [Miracles] Was it too obvious? 9.75 square centimeters. So you have to be blind not to notice. [Serap] Did it happen when you were a kid? Was it an accident? Was it an accident? I do not know. Maybe. What happened? [silence] [Ahmet] You want to learn. Yes I want. -[Ahmet] It's a terrible story, though. -Okay, I'll listen. Alright. [nose and sighing sound] My father drank a lot, I mean. I don't know why you're drinking. In other words, the smoking man is not asked why he is drinking. One day he drank too much again. Probably in the third bottle or something. He has a stash at home, but his head is so beautiful, He doesn't remember where he is. He asks my mother. I was then one and a half, two years old or something. I am in my mother's arms. My father asks, where is the bottle? My mother is shouting that enough is enough, enough is enough. That's how they're pushing At that moment, my father breaks the empty bottle in his hand. And he starts shaking the broken bottle at my mother. [sighs] There comes a moment when... ...my mother will probably get hurt, so I don't know. I'm in your arms too. Like this I guess it's a reflex, I don't know. I don't know if it's self-preservation instinct, suddenly he pushes me towards the bottle. [cutting cry] Later? [Ahmet] Then, I fell to the ground. My father kicked me. I fell under the bed where my parents were making love. Then my father continued where he left off. Later? [Ahmet] Then he tore my mother apart. A sobriety comes at that moment, I guess I don't know, he suddenly remembers his stash. He goes, takes the bottle, drinks it too. Nicely. It's leaking. Of course there is a lot of noise by the way, They complain about neighbors or something, they call the police. The police are coming. They take my father infiltrated, take him away, arrest him. Take my mom to the hospital. [silence] They forget me, under the bed. They forget. Then a neighbor says, There was a child, there was a baby in this house. He says where? They are looking for the house. They find me under the bed. Blood flowing from my mother, blood flowing from me. A pool of blood. I'm in the middle. Like that. Coagulated blood. I'm stuck on the ground. It's like sucking milk from my mother's breast all night long I drank my mother's blood. I've never cried though. Never, ever. [silence] Then my mother dies in the hospital. They are throwing my father in prison. Less than a week later, they get involved in something, and they strangle it there. I am in the hospital. A relative is coming to the hospital. I don't know who that relative is, so I still don't know. Someone is coming. He sees me, so they show him. My situation is clear. No one is that relative anymore... …shakes his head like that. Then there is the orphanage. It's like a novel. [Ahmet confirms] [Ahmet] There are 50 of them behind me. Kemalettin Tugcu. Same story. [crying breath] Let me check on a Marilyn, has she come? [exhales] But get love, bro. What did you do to Serap sister, the woman is crying loudly downstairs. It is dust. He took the books. Maybe he has an allergy or something. [train whistle] [door knocks] [bird chirping] [Kurdish] My son! Zinar! [door creaks] [Emotional music] [Kurdish, grandfather] What will happen to Zinar? [Kurdish, mother] Father… Zinar is much smaller… Can't stand the road. I can't have it there... Besides, if anything happens to us, at least Zinar will live. May our roots continue. -[Kurdish, grandfather] My daughter… -[Kurdish, mother] Dad, what should I do? Do I have any other chance? Do I want to leave him? Much smaller. Let him grow up a little, I'll take him with us. [Kurdish, still] Sister? Elder sister? Shall we go to the market with Zinar? I'll buy him candy, and we'll travel. My father will come too. -[Kurdish] Zinar? -[Kurdish] Mom! Mother! -[Kurdish] Do you want candy? -[Kurdish] Yes! Yeah! [Kurdish] Come on, don't be late. Okay? -Do not misbehave there! -[Kurdish Zinar] Dede, grandfather! Come on, we're going to buy candy! Adar, I'm going to buy candy. My aunt will buy me candy. Look, my mom gave me money. -[bird chirping] -[sad music] I will not give it to you! [women cry] [sad music] [Kurdish] Hala, come. Sugar! [Kurdish] Get it! Get! [Kurdish] Dede, look sugar! [Kurdish] Eat, eat. -[Kurdish] Take it still. -[Kurdish] You eat too. [Kurdish] Grandpa, you eat too. [Kurdish] My son… [sad music] [Kurdish] Mom! Mother! Mother! Mother! Anne! Mom, where are you? [sad music] Granny, where is my mom? [Kurdish] Zinar, mother gone! [Kurdish] Son, come. [Kurdish] Dede, where is my mother? [sad music] [breathing sounds] [sad music] [Screams in Kurdish] Mom! [door closes] -[street noise] -[smoking noise] [door knocks] Hello. I brought the books, the Schoendoerffers. Are you available? Where are the others? They broke up half an hour ago, and maybe Marilyn is at home. [whistle] -Would you like? - At this hour? [drinking voice] Fine, I'll drink. Have lots of ice, but lots of it. It's possible. [street hum] [Ahmet] How old do you think I am? [sound of pouring ice into glass] -40. -[Ahmet] Three. [Mirage] So? So I'm going downhill towards my 50. My belly started to come out. Whiteness in the hair and beard. I'm not a very healthy person, you haven't seen my scar yet huh. It's a disaster. I'm not really the type to look at like that. There's a lot of hot boys out there, why are you here, why me? Is there an attraction in me that I don't see, that I don't notice? Don't be sad, what will happen? According to Marilyn, Aysin was also a very beautiful, attractive woman. What does he find in you? Ours is just honest shopping, that's all. -I guess he adores his sentences. -[sarcastic] Huh huh. -How many sentences did you write to him? 30, 40? -[outside protest voice] No, so if that's the secret, I've read both notebooks. [silence] [the sound of putting the book on the table] [Mirage] Coincidence. When I slept in your bed last night, it was lying open like that under my hand, It's like read me. -After the first sentence-- -This is how other people live their lives. You know what's wrong with someone who is cheekily curious? Vital. [voices of protest from the street] You're right. But I was impressed by your writing. It really betrays all your intelligence. No, really. I think you should finish the novel, you've already come to the end. I don't like stories that have no ending. Is that so? I still haven't softened, so the matter is not closed. Don't be so shy. Have you ever been in love? -No. -How? So, I don't know, I had an excuse. What excuse? Well… I thought no one would accept me. I was cautious. Here is my greatest love, Sevgi, mother, you already know. No, I do not know. I'll tell you, but I have one condition. -Yup. -You will not cry. -I try. Guys, look here. I will introduce you to someone. Love mom. You call her Love mom, okay. Sevgi Hanım will come here to visit you three days a week from now on. When he comes, he will bring sweets, gifts, books and so on. Here we go, let's start with you, okay. The phaeton fell for you. Oh, honey it's me. This is yours. I am very pleased to meet you. We'll see each other often now, I'm here three days a week. Look, that's down to you too. What a beautiful shirt you have. This is your book. [Emotional music] [Ahmet] Love mom, my first disappointment. [children's voices] Ian Ahmet, come, my son, you too. [children's voices] -[boy 1] Why isn't he talking? -[boy 2] He's mute, he never speaks. [boy 3] He's pretending, is he dumb? Do not come if you do not want to! People used to need love anyway. He wanted to love someone, to count, to serve him. [Ahmet] Your love mother had a smooth neck, white, clean. I've never touched one that smells good. [Emotional music] My hand bowed to the ban for minutes. Finally, I couldn't help but stick my finger out. I was touching it. Love mother, can I be your child? [Ahmet] After being abandoned… [children] He spoke. [Ahmet] … that's when I spoke for the first time. -Love mom! Be my mother! -Ahmet! Ahmet! [Ahmet] He must have thought for a moment that I had a child. -[Love] Ahmet. Ahmet. -[Ahmet] His name was Sevgi. But he never liked me. -Ahmet. [Ahmet] My arms were like an umbilical cord, it wouldn't break. But I couldn't stand the pain when his hand hit my shoulder. I let go of the leg that gave birth to me. [sad music] [ringing sound] [Ahmet] Love mother willingly He had thrown it out of his womb and dropped it. I haven't cried since that day, you know? Never, for years. [street hum] Candy, chocolate. I've always hated them all. Sugar… it meant betrayal to me. [whistles from the street] I left the sugar there. What happened, did you have a family? Were you adopted? I adopted. How? I adopted my grandfather. How did you adopt your grandfather? [Emotional music] [Ahmet] When we entered the park the night we ran away from the dormitory We heard someone crying. -One grandfather alone. -[groaning sound] The paper is gone, they're going to throw me in the pool. He keeps saying the same thing. [Ahmet] The paper is gone, they're going to throw me in the pool. The paper is gone, they're going to throw me in the pool. -[Ahmet] Later We realized that he lost a piece of paper he always carried in his pocket. Grandpa, why are you crying? [Ahmet] We are scattered, we are searching like crazy. We finally found the paper. We couldn't stand it because we were wondering what the pool or something had to do with it. we read it. [Ahmet] This document was given by the Tarlabaşı District Headman. Death of Hasan Topçu, the owner of this paper In case of burial, the burial will be done by our headman. Please call 234 23 24. -[sad music] -[sigh sound] -Here, grandpa, put it in your pocket. -Thanks, son, thank you. [Ahmet] That's right, after grandfather Hasan died because he was an orphan. He thought he would be sent to the cadaver pool, because then after the orphans died in Izmir They were putting the corpses in the cadaver pool. The biggest fear of this is not being buried. That's what he thought, he thought he was going to swim in a pool forever. Shopkeepers have heard this too. Will they stop, of course, They always made fun of it, they frightened it. So we adopted him so that grandfather Hasan would not be lonely. The three of us that day, the whole dorm the next day. Then we informed all the neighborhood shopkeepers and notables. Hasan Topçu is our child. Just so that we can join in with him. After that, no one touched our child. Fatherhood was hard, but we were happy. Thus, we all had a 70-year-old child. Our child's only fear was not to be buried. This is my biggest fear, too. The only legacy my grandfather left me is this fear, not being buried. Swimming forever in a cadaver pool. I can't imagine a greater punishment than that. [sad music] [prayer sounds] [Ahmet] We buried our grandfather a year later. I personally checked his coffin. It was definitely him inside the shroud. We kept the promise we made years ago, We did not give our child to the cadaver pool. We were 30 people at the funeral. Don't underestimate 30 people. There were only seven people at Mozart's funeral. Then we built a cemetery for him. Here, the only child of a hundred children, Hasan Topçu, the only grandfather of a hundred children, lies. [sad music] It was a good story. [glass tone] [street noise] I'll stop by ours from here. Joyful? I will work at home. Write a book first on your to-do list before you die. -OK. We'll communicate then. -OK. Or You can stop by me tomorrow if you want. Tomorrow is okay. -It's possible. -I have the address, okay. -OK. Well, we communicate. -OK. [Serap] Bye bye. [street noise] [street hum] [ringing sound] [television] Such was the case at night and in the first light of day. Events in Gezi Park and Taksim continued in the morning and throughout the day. Intervention of the protesters followed one after another. To those trying to enter Gezi Park-- [television] The complete success of our armed forces with a success that our nation is proud of Operation Dawn in Northern Iraq We offer an evaluation.

Then we were shot at from the house that had its back against the rock. Then you sent us to the lower part of the village to gag. OK. Then you went in. 10 minutes later, those dogs fired rockets. You were unconscious on the floor when we arrived, commander. Forty minutes later, the helicopter came and we carried you to the helicopter. This much. We took him to the hospital, it's over. Okay, I remember there was a kid there. So like this… -Didn't you? -I swear I didn't see it, brother. All of our team was already stuffing. I say there were special forces with you, believe me now.

It must have been about 10 minutes before the RPG hit. in ten minutes A boy came towards me, he wanted to say something. even you I remember when you intervened. -No, commander, I swear it's not like that. Until the news that Ahmet Ensign had been shot we haven't even moved from our place. Then we came, helicopter, I am one of those who carried you to the helicopter on a stretcher.

When did you forget your Kenan dog? You saved me from his hand. Oh brother, don't make me tell you, you already know all of them. I know. Your nose didn't come out of shit either. It really is. But now I think like this. I transform from a caterpillar to a butterfly. -Butterfly. -Yup. My little butterfly. Yes bro, really. When I find myself, I forget the past, man. Only the best memories remain in my mind. That's because I don't want to remember the bad ones. It is deleted without my knowing it. Is it good or bad? I do not know. Maybe if I forget… ...but, but it would be harder, wouldn't it, brother? And meeting with you made everything much easier. Come on. When a person has a place to take shelter when he is afraid, safe.

Two children who appeared to be registered in the household were also on the mountain. Intelligence was given. It was exactly what we expected, we got the second shot there.

And you were left alone by the door. -[gunshots] -[dog barking] -[exploding sound] -[dog barking] -[breathing sound] -[dog barking] Okay okay. -Later? -Later, two or three of us went behind the house to prevent them from escaping. You then swept into the house, scanning the war like this. Look, I said to the upper infantryman, but I said he was a young man. I'm sorry, that's what I thought when you came in.

Let them throw me in the pool. If God chose to write my end in shallow waters This time I will not question your decision. [sad music] -Good morning. -Good morning. Huh, tell me. You will say something. Good to know you. Good thing I slept on this bed that night. [breathing sounds] Everything will be beautiful, okay? Yup. Are you prepared? Isn't it early? [Ahmet] No. I have a job with Mesut, but he will leave anyway. But we were going to go together, no way. OK, I'm not running. I'm there at one o'clock. Well okay. But we'll see you at the hospital. OK. [kissing sound] -See you later. -[Mirage] Okay. [kissing sound] [table setting sounds] Help. By God, if I didn't know about you, I would say you are watering me. I'm in love with Serap, maybe if it wasn't for her. By God, if I were you, I would marry him immediately. What do you know, maybe we'll get married. Really? Tell the truth. OK. OK, I won't tell anyone. I will never talk to Serap sister either. Come on, sit down, have your breakfast. -I'm going to Mesut. I will there. -OK.

Commander asked me to give this to you. this one? He said something though. [sad music] [sigh sound] What happened? [sad music] What happened? You check with your doctor, I'm going home. [Ahmet inner voice] I was actually going to burn it but I thought you might want to read more. I know you don't like stories that have no ending. Being loved will not heal the wound in my soul. But not as an orphan thanks to you, I will die knowing that someone can love me. -[sad music] -[breathing sounds] [key tone] [screams] Ahmet! [crying out] Ahmet! Ahmet! No. Ahmet. [crying sound] [sad music] [Ahmet inner voice] My only consolation is being able to finish Zinar's novel. a half-life I don't know if it is possible to complete it with these words, but at least i tried. The howling of the wind, the hasty steps of a dog. Silent picture of a broken lightning bolt in the north. A sleepy vole of a vole… … his skeptical sniff of the environment. The rustling of icy snow… …and a little further thin… …an angry child's voice. My father will kill you. [sad music] -[wind howling] -[sad music] -[squeaking sound] -[water sound] [generic soundtrack]
