Can I get one of these after? - I don't want to make some poor pledge feel like crap for being a virgin. - They've been doing this initiation for years. It's harmless.

You need to get that back to the med lab clean and in one piece. - Mo, no one's going to actually have sex with it. - Mwah! - Doc, this is Alana. Alana, Doc, frat prez. - The pre-med pledge? - Are you pre-med too? - Doctor of love. I gotta hand it to you, you really came through for us. And I see some bright things in her future, Lanny-Banany. - So, uh, Alana, are you ready to be our honey? - Huh? - We need you to be our queen bee and lure these nerdy pledges into their doom. - OK, but we're not gonna hurt any of them, right? - No, we won't hurt them. We'll just, I don't know, embarrass the shit out of them. - Uh, she doesn't want to hurt any feelings either. - Oh, are you worried about this guy pulling rabbits out of people's asses? - Oh, oh! - See that? - Oh, oh, whoa! - Oh, whoa!

I mean, it's actually cracked. - What are those names on it? - Back when frats were actually fun, not uptight snowflake fests, we'd immortalize the worst pledge of the year on it. - After giving him the mother of all paddlings. - We wouldn't stop until he'd bleed, OK? (Mo chuckling) - Kirk Allen, 2003. Peter Adams, 2014. - People still talk about that guy. - Kenny Couillard, 2019. Who's that? Hmm? - What? - He didn't pass initiation. He cracked up. - Yeah, he ended up in a mental hospital. - Yeah, ancient history, guys. We're here to get drunk, get high and... OK? (Laughing) Now... Merry and me are gonna go try out those bunks. And you two can do whatever you want with that paddle. - Enjoy! - Thanks, guys! (Sighing) (Mo inhaling sharply) (Lock clicking) - You see? That's the problem with trains like these.

I should have known better. - No, no, you thought you saw a dead body. That would mess anyone up. But of course, they don't think about that, because they have no feelings. Hey! How many more people need to be traumatized? - What? - Your gags are cruel and shitty. But targeting innocent people is crossing the line. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - The fake dead body she found in the bathroom while doing her job? - Sounds hilarious, but it's not my work. - Of course it's you. This has you written all over it. Loving everyone squirming and hurt while you're in control! - Hey, I didn't fucking do it, OK? - I didn't realize how scared you were. - Scared of what? Scared of you? - Your ways of doing things are done, Doc! - And--and here we go again. You know, if I said half the shit that you say about me about women, I'd be cancelled. My balls would be strung up in town square. But you get to spout off whatever garbage you want. - It's not just me. Look around! Everyone is tired of your shit! They tolerate you, but nobody actually likes you! - Well, you should worry a little less about me. Maybe, just maybe, worry a little more about Mo, 'cause if anybody is tolerating anybody, it's him! - Oh, you don't know the first thing about us. - I know that the poor guy's hiding in a VIP room drinking himself half-blind wondering if he needs an escape plan from your relationship. - If he is, it's because of you. - Hey, Alana! - What? - The future is female. - Fuck you! - Mo's in the VIP room with Pet. And she's got the major hots for him. - Oh, I know. (Chuckling) - Mmm... (Sighing) Pet... (Mo sighing) - I can tell you want to. - Fine. Mm-mmm. (Knocking on door) - (Alana): Mo? Mo? - (Whispering): Shit. - Mo? - Shit. - What happens in the VIP... (Knocking on door) ...stays in the VIP. (Scoffing) - Ugh! (Chuckling) - Mmm. No, no! Pet, Jesus, I don't want my life to implode! - Jackson! Where's Mo? Have you seen him? OK, if this is some bro-code bullshit, I will fuck you up, don't think I won't! - Alana? - There you are. - Hey, sorry! Lizard guy, get your claws off my girlfriend. - I was getting worried about you. - Worried? - Mm-hmm. - What could you possibly be worried about? We're on a train. ♪ ♪ - Who's the idiot that hired this guy again? Oh, wait, that was you! - Yeah, yeah. Actually, the sorority just asked for his contact info. They want to hire him for New Year's. (Sighing) (Inhaling sharply) - Oh--oh my God. - What? What did he do? - My waist, my entire waist just got, like, pulled forward uncontrollably. - Magnetism. - Do me! - Do we have to pay this guy extra to fuck our ladies? 'Cause it's about to go down. - If you'll excuse me. So, what are you so afraid of? - Why would I be afraid? - Because magic is about perception and control: two things that make a guy like you nervous. - Whoa. Yeah, watch it, buddy. - Yeah. (Chuckling) Maybe you should be afraid. (Prez chuckling) (Scoffing) - This guy is fucking dangerous. - Yeah, sure, whatever you say, man. (♪ Electronic playing in distance ♪) - Mmm. Um. (Clears throat, sighing) I'm sorry. About everything, not just all the bullshit that happened tonight. Like, really, I mean it. And I--I--I'm--I'm not just trying to, you know, temporarily smooth things over, patch things up. It's--it's--it's-- - I know - It's... Mmm... Mmm... - You and I spent 2 months straight together last summer. And you were nothing like this. - I--I know. I know. I know. And then back to school, and, boom, instant dickhead. - Right, but only when you're hanging out with Doc. - Yeah, well, Doc's my best friend. - I mean, is he though? How good of a friend can he be? I mean, he likes to see me angry, Mo. - Ah, that's just his fucked up sense of humour. - OK, trying to break us up isn't funny to me. He's only happy if you do exactly what he wants. And that's not a friend. - That is just the stupid frat stuff. - It's everything. Maybe he's in love with you. (Scoffing) - Yeah. (Chuckling) No, no! No, no, Doc likes to hook up with other women with Mitchy. It's, like, their thing. They're all about it, you know? - And he's never asked you to join? Just make sure that whatever you're doing is for you. - You're right. - Because I love that person. (Clicking tongue) - You know, I was beginning to wonder when I saw you with the cool magician dude. (Giggling) - I hate to admit it, but I do like to be surprised with a little bit of attention. - Oh. - But no. What I want... is you. Just you being your own person. Because that's what I find really, really sexy. (Woman screaming in distance) - What the fuck was that? (Crowd cheering) (Sighing) (Chuckling) What the fuck was that? Mmm... - To be continued. (Mo sighing) - Goddammit. Mmm! - This is a party. And last time I checked, we are not exhibitionists like Doc and Mitchy. OK? Let's go. - Whoo! (Crowd chatting, laughing) - I'm gonna find Mitchy. She won't want to miss this. - OK. (Sighing) Thanks, asshole. - Trouble in paradise? - You sent Alana to go find me even though I had Pet practically doing a topless lap dance on my crotch. Why? - Um, it's the love train, bro. Look, I thought you guys were here for the same reasons the rest of us are. - That's bullshit. You're trying to fuck with my relationship. Look, you keep interfering with my personal life, you're gonna lose the last real friendship you have around here. - Mitchy? Ugh! I swear, if you have passed out again... Oh... Sorry! Oh, you haven't seen my friend, have you? - Sexy witch? - Hard to miss. - Ha! No. - She crashes when she's high. - Me too. Might as well be dead. - Ugh! Mitchy! I can't believe you'd take part in something like this. (Scoffing) Mitchy? Girl, really? Ugh! Really? Ugh! Mitchy! Mitchy! (Whispering): Mitchy? Mitchy? Oh God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mitchy? (Sobbing): Mitchy? No, no, no, no! (Crying) No, Mitchy! Mitchy, please! - Oh my God! - No! (Sobbing) - Now, who's hungry for the dark stuff? (Crowd cheering) Are we having fun yet? - (Crowd): Yeah! (Crowd members whooping) - Well, come close. Because you're gonna want to feel this one before we take a little break. Don't be shy to get your hands on me. Now, tell me... where am I now? (Crowd gasping) - What? - I hope he's disappeared for good. Hey, Mo, you still butthurt? (Mo gasping) Oh my God! Mo! Mo! I think Mo's been stabbed! (Crowd cheering) Help! Hey! Mo, Mo, Mo, sit down! Stay with me! - Nice try, guys. - Someone help! Oh God. Oh God. Help! Come on, stay with me! Stay with me! Someone! Come on, Mo, come on, no! This is real! Hey! - These party trains do a circuit of a barely-used set of tracks, meaning we can't call the police. - Tha-that's impossible. You can get cell service anywhere. - Not this far north. It's all wilderness up here. We won't get reception for, like, an hour. Come on. (Breathing heavily) - Someone help! (Mo choking) - What happened? - Oh my God! - I don't know. - No, no, no. No, no. Mo, you're with me. You're OK. You're OK. You're with me. Mo, look at me. Stay with me. Mo! Mo, please, please. (Alana crying) Mo! Mo! No, no, no! Baby, please. Mo! Mo! Mo! Who did this? - I didn't see anything! One moment he's fine, the next... - I'm gonna call Carne. - I think he struck an artery! Oh, Mo, Mo! - What can we do? Fuck! What can we do? - Mo, stay with me. Please, Mo. - Your friend needs medical help. Carne, crank this train as fast as you can! (Sobbing) - Mo, Mo! Stay with me, baby! Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo! Mo, stay-- Mo! (Mo gasping, grunting) Mo! (Sobbing) Who the fuck is doing this to us? (Screaming, sobbing) (Train whistling) (Alana crying) - Mitchy, we need to find her. - Come on. - No, Doc. - We need to find Mitchy. - Doc... - She's in danger too. - She's dead. - (Whispering): Don't fuck with me, OK? - I wouldn't. She's... She's... - No, no, no, no! Fuck! (Breathing heavily) We're next. We're fucking next. It's you and me. (Brakes screeching, people screaming) - Dude, what the hell are you doing? People went flying! - Shut the fuck up! - I am done with your bullshit. I won that election fair and square. - No... - No, let me finish. You don't like me or how I'm trying to change this frat. A fraternity you almost destroy-- (Grunting) - (Woman): Oh my God! - Open your eyes, bro. - No, no, this is a prank. You've gone too far this time. - It's not a prank. This is really happening to us. (Crowd chatting, indistinct) - OK, we're gonna do a headcount. And then we'll get on the go in ten. (Sighing) I told Jim to keep the, uh, engine-room door locked until we pull into the station. OK, everyone. Everyone, please listen up. Everyone, please, I need your attention. Listen, everyone? - Shut the hell up! - OK, I get it. You're scared. So am I! But there's safety in numbers. - Tell Mo that. - W-while we're still all in here, we're safe as long as we stick together. The train's going to be starting again in a few minutes. But before then, my crew and I are gonna sweep through all the cars, right from the engine room to the last car, make sure there's nobody hiding out and that we're all accounted for, OK? But first, anyone who's wearing a mask, would you please remove it? OK, take a look around. Now, is there anybody you don't recognize? - No. - Uh... - (Carne): No? - No. - I don't see Jackson and I don't see Ed. - (Man): Wait, is... - OK, but we're still gonna have to get a headcount just to find out if there's anybody missing. - Missing? Do you mean more people have been murdered? Not just Mo and Mitchy? - Wait, what? - No. No, no, no! I mean your friends could be out there drunk. Or--or afraid or doing whatever their libido is telling them to do right now. In the meantime, we need to get an accurate headcount. So, please, stay seated or standing as you are so that my colleague here can get an accurate count, OK? All right, thank you. - We're being targeted for what we did that night. - It was a goddamn prank. - That drove Kenny insane. And now, we're paying the price. (Inhaling deeply) - We're not staying here. OK? It wasn't safe for Mo, it's not gonna be safe for us. Let's go. - Let go of me. (Breathing heavily) - Gotta keep an eye on those doors. No one comes in. We sure as hell don't go out. (Lock clicking) The train makes it back to the station, and we're safe, OK? This is how we stay alive. (Breathing heavily) OK? (Breathing heavily) - Ah! (Sighing) Jesus Christ! (Scoffing) Assholes. - Nobody knows that we were behind that prank. I think you're mixing up, "We didn't tell anyone we did it," with, "A lot of people have a pretty good idea it was us." - OK, fine. Say it was one of those losers out there. Who? And why? And why now? 'Cause Kenny was 3 years ago. (Sniffling) - They were waiting... ...to get us all together. Somewhere we wouldn't be able to run for any help. - Our new president? - I mean, I can understand him wanting to kill you. But the rest of us? - What if it was Ed? Last time I saw him was at the train station. - Maybe he never made it on the train. - But his costume did. Fuck. - The magician. - Yeah, boring us to death wasn't enough. - He's a weird guy, gave off a strange vibe the moment we met. - He waved knives in front of my face. - Kenny, wasn't Kenny into magic or something? - What? This is some weird revenge-magic pact? - Well, what else do we have? This guy, he caught me alone. He said horrible things about you and Mo and the frat and how he wished that this train would crash and kill everyone on board. - Seriously? Oh my God. (Exhaling sharply) Fuck. It's him. It's him. It's him. I knew he was a creep. This may be the first time you and I have ever agreed on anything. - We have to tell the others. - No, we need to sit tight until we make it back to the real world. - What if there are other people out there that he intends to kill, we knew and we did nothing about it? - Sucks to be them, I guess. But I'm not opening that door until we make it back to the station and the entire police department shows up. - Don't worry. I wouldn't ask you to. (Door unlocking) (Door closing) (Breathing shakily) (Gasping, screaming) - I come in peace! I promise! It's OK! - Sorry. - No, don't apologize. It's... Wait, what are you doing here? You should be in the bar with everyone. Carne said-- - Doc didn't think it was safe. So we barricaded ourselves in that stupid VIP room. It gave us time to think. - And? - What if the magician is behind all this? (Chuckling) - He's the only outside guest here. His whole job is to be in two places at once. - That doesn't make him a killer. - I know. But let's just find him and get proof. Or prove it's not him. At least it's something to start with. - OK. Let's go get Carne and talk to the magician together. (Sighing) (Coughing, sniffling) (Bottle slamming on table) - (Alana, on phone): Hi, Kenny. I've been waiting for you. Kiss me, Kenny. Kiss me.

(Grunting, groaning) - I'm the president of this fraternity. This is my event. I--I should be out there with them representing us. - I mean, you can go. It's not like they locked us in here. - Well, maybe I will. I--I mean, we deserve to know what's going on, right? They let you go out there with them? - What? Uh, no, Jesus... We're, um, gonna go backstage to find the magician. - Find anything? What? What'd you find? - Well, Alana-- Alana has a theory that the magician they hired is the one behind all this. - Well, why would he want to kill your friends? - I don't know. It--it--it might not be him. But he's been really strange and... - Did you check backstage? - We were waiting for you. - Good call. Come on. Excuse us. - This is bullshit. (Sighing) (Sighing) - Where the hell is he? If he didn't jump, he's on this train somewhere. - And if he did jump? - We're in the middle of nowhere. - Carne? Oh God. - Oh my God. That's Jackson's. - Oh. - The killer must have been wearing it when he... - (Whispering): Yeah... - He could still be here wearing anything, pretending to be anybody. (Inhaling deeply) - If these killings are targeted, then Alana and her friends, they're in grave danger. - The VIP room! It's only got 2 doors. We could station someone at either end. Keep you safe. - Get her down there. I'll get to the locomotive car. And we'll get this train back into civilization as fast as we can! - Come on. (Train whistling) - Let him know we're here. - He said he wouldn't let me back in. (Breathing heavily) Doc? It's Alana. Open the door. (Sadie breathing heavily) Please, Doc. It's dangerous here! Open the door! Open the goddamn door! - (Whispering): OK, just one sec. (Door unlocking) (Screaming, gasping) Oh my...
