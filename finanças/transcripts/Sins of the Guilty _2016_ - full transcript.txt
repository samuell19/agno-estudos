You've been around with every girl in town. Why the hell you care where I've been? - I am your husband. I deserve to know where you've been and who you've been with.

You are not gonna hurt me Thomas. - They always come back. You? - Today's moving day and I miss him. He's gone forever. His smell, his touch, his smile. All gone. But I admit there's a lot of peace without Thomas. He always brought confusion as well as passion. I knew I wasn't the only one. But the challenge excited me. But now he is gone. No more confusion. - I don't understand why Vanessa insists on living in such a foul, disgusting place. The dirt, the grime, the noise. Vanessa this neighborhood is incredibly noisy. I can't believe you chose to live like this. I'll have the entire staff come here and help you clean. - You know I don't, you know I really don't the entire staff. But I'm so glad that you are here. Oh Nana. - I came as soon as I found out. - I didn't think it was gonna end like this with Thomas. - You know that's how things work out sometimes. You know if you had just stayed in the family mansion, none of this would have happened. - You know I don't want to live like that anymore. - That's okay, that's okay. We are gonna handle this. You are a Johnson. - Yeah that's right. I'm a Johnson. Johnson. I hate that I have to leave here. You think it's filthy. I think it is great. And so many memories. You know and so many Speaking of memories Vanessa what's that? - It's a watch. It's a watch I gave Thomas. Hey! I'm here. - You are here, all right. I mean it. - Yes, so this is it huh? Wow! It's cozy. - Yeah. You know my family is rich, not me. - Ah, it is okay. Where should I put this? - Oh, you can just put it over there in that closet, bedroom. Oh it is a closet/bedroom. - Well sometimes I use it as a closet. I'm so glad you are here. - I'm too. I'm too baby. It is exciting. - I got you something. - You don't have to do that. - Wait.

Every day I come home, I'm gonna have something for you. We are gonna be so rich. We are gonna get several places. We are gonna wine and dine every night. It is gonna be so great. Since that business is off the ground, like to do that I need some real money. Do you know what I mean? - Yeah I know. - We don't have to talk about that right now. Come here. - I missed you. - Oh look who it is? Long time no see. But you are here now, so you must want something. - Yes I do. I want you to write some music for me. I want to get back to like choreographing and all that. - Oh really? You know my talent isn't free dear. It's gonna come with a price. - Oh really? What price? - The price that you tell me why you really been gone and who's been getting all these? - Wow it shows huh? - Yeah it do shows. I've been your best friend your whole life. So I know when you are getting some okay? You are too much. - You momma, now you've got a boyfriend? - Sort of. - I know that you do. I even know every little move you make, damn. You get on my nerves. - Oh my gosh, could you just write a song for me please? - Could you not rush me, because I definitely don't have all the answers okay? I need to know what's happening, is he doing it right? You having a good time? Girl, I need to know. - You know what? He is doing it right. But you know what? I think I'm, I think I'm in love. - Vanessa you ain't in no damn love. Could you take your time? Move slow, just enjoy it, have fun. Not run around talking about you and love. - No I'm to stupid. Why can't you just be happy for me? - Girl, you know it is your damn mind. Go get us something to drink. So I could write this silly ass song. You want to hear it? - Yeah I want to hear your song. - This is the song I'm gonna write for you. Here, hit it like this. - You got the boards out for these. - Yeah this is for you. Vanessa is so stupid. She asked a man to move in. Vanessa is so stupid and she's filled with sin. That's your Jam. You like that? That's your jam, that's what you came all the way over here for. - Girl are you crazy? - If you want a better one, I need some more answers. Ask a man to move in girl, you are crazy. I don't know what I'm gonna do with you girl. I'm in love and moved this man in. - Thomas was a dreamer, but that's all they were, dreams. He was my reality. I'd do anything to keep him happy. Anything to keep him near me. And he knew that. I was willing to pay the price. No matter what it cost me. - I'm very excited about this, but we need to be able to trust each other. Of course. - Just say to me, you can trust me. What do you mean? Of course you can trust me. You can trust me. - Okay, okay! Are we doing this? - Yes we are, we are. So listen, in regards to the paying for the investment in the space, my uncle is actually going to cover half or my portion and I'm gonna have my other half, in fact I already have it ready to go, so I just need to know that your half is ready to go. - Ah, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. - Do you have it? - I have it, okay? - Okay. - All right? - Yes, we are good. We are good. - I think I saw a kitchen out there, so would you please show me your kitchen and exteriors? - Yes, yes, yes. - You know mom, I'm glad you are here. I know you were not the biggest Thomas fan. - No Vanessa, I was not a Thomas fan, but you are my daughter. - I was hoping maybe we could connect you know I really need my family right now. - I'd like that too. What really went on between you two? What really happened? - We were fine. I mean we were a couple in love. We had our ups and down but, - You remember Paris don't you? I knew something was wrong. - Yeah you always know something is wrong. You always know something is wrong. You know I, it was a one-time fluke. I thought maybe I thought things would change. - Vanessa you've always been too giving. Too trusting, giving too many people the benefit of the doubt that don't deserve it. I even struggle to find you toys because I knew that you just give them away. - Okay, so I'm a giver. So what? Jeez. - So the truth Vanessa. What really went on between you too? - The truth? The truth is is, the truth is yeah he left me alone a lot and it really hurt. And honestly it really reminded me of of when I was a kid, I was in the mansion with you guys and you guys go away on trips for days and leave me alone just like he did. It was like too much. It was like I was back in that cycle all over again of wanting to be loved and thinking you have support and it is there and then it is gone you know. Mom? Mom? Nothing has changed. That's very kind to say. I don't really know what to do. I just try to keep him with me all the time even though I know he is not here. Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. I'll bring the vanilla cake. It will be great. Yeah. I'm gonna go down there now actually. Everybody is expecting me. Ciao. - My name is Detective Stevens. Special transfer from the UK. Are you Vanessa Johnson? - Yeah I'm Vanessa Johnson. - We are here to investigate the murder on Thomas Carter. Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? - Okay. - Where were you when the homicide took place? - I was with Thomas. We had an argument and then I left. - Where did you go? - To the park to cool off and came back, I thought we'd get back together but, but I remember we had a dance class so. - Okay, well here's my card. Give me a call when you have more time. - Yeah sure. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for coming out my way. Car broke down. - No problem. Where do you want to go? - Why don't you just come in for a minute? - No. Why? - Because you know it look like you are dressed to go anywhere. - We can go somewhere or not. - You answer me. - No, no, just come in for a bit. There you go. Come sit here. - Wow, so you do not want to go out huh? - Why would you want to leave paradise? - You must really think I'm easy. - No. I think you are beautiful. You are different from all these other girls I meet. - Oh, you are good. You are very cunning. - You need a date. You need love. - Really? - Really. You probably been fine dining your whole life. You know what that is but do you know what it is to be loved Vanessa? - Well Thomas, I can't say I do. - Then let me start from there. - Wow. - You are a woman, not a date. And I think you need me. - Gosh. Oh my gosh, more junk? Thomas really you have so much junk in this house. Every time I come over, I just feel like I have to clean up. - Was, because you are my little helper. You helped me sort it all out. - You need way more than me. - No baby. I know what I need. - I don't understand you. I mean you come here to this and you work so hard Thomas. I know you want material things. It is not hard to tell. You didn't grow up rich like me. What's the deal? - Mm, I grew really poor. We didn't have anything. What was it like growing up rich? - Well we were very wealthy and there were a lot of rules. It sucked. - And being broke, really sucks. Look I'm just staying here to appease my roommate. Well you could clean up. - He's gonna go on to the business with me. His family has all the money. - So that's why you don't do anything around here. - Look I just, I'm getting out of this place. That's why I don't pay any attention to it. He charges me an arm and a leg just to stay in this dump. He should clean up. - What's your dream Thomas? - Photography studio. I'm almost there. I'm just staying here to appease my roommate. He is my business partner. His family has money. Just stick around okay. I'm gonna have a lot more than kisses for you. - Thomas was a great lover. He was caring, kind. I hadn't had much of that. I believed him. He seemed smart, determined. I was determined but only to escape my childhood. Thomas was running to his future. He'd seen so much more than me. I wanted to learn. Too eager I guess. I wanted to trust him. My heart started making me blind. - You look so hot right now. - Shut up. - No. I am so glad you finally decided to stay the night with me. - Well, stay the night with you amongst your pile of mess. - What do you want? Guys live here. - Yeah you are not just any guy. You are my guy. - I'm your guy. - If you wanna be. - I wanna be. - Good. You know I haven't had a lot of boyfriends before. - You are sheltered Vanessa. Everybody knows that. - Everybody knows that. Well, don't break my heart then. - I don't break hearts. I make them. - Move in with me? - What? - Yeah - And leave this palace. - And leave this dump. Move in with me. I'm ready. - Are you sure? - Yeah I'm sure. It's time I made some grownup moves. - You know I don't have a lot. - I know you don't have a lot, but you work hard. - I don't mind to foot the bill for a little while. I'll foot the bill so you can get your business going. - You mean your family will? - Look I'm gonna get to a point where I never have to ask them for anything again. I'm counting on you Thomas. Let me help you and then you can help me. - I need you. We are gonna do this together. I like this little wounded bird I just want to take care of. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hello Vanessa. - Well Hello mom. - It's been brought to my attention that a police detective has come to visit. - Brought to your attention? What are you? Just the all-knowing, all-seeing rich lady up there? - Don't joke Vanessa. This is a serious matter. What have you told him? - I haven't told him anything. You know what? I told him everything. - You know you are a suspect. - Mom no it is not like that. They just, he just came for some questioning and besides I didn't harm Thomas. I loved him. - Listen, if there is anything that you want to tell me, now is the time. - You are a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful mom. - Don't disrespect the family name. - The family name? Is that what you called here about? Thomas is dead. He is not gonna come back. Got it?! - Vanessa, I'm going to be there the next time that you are questioned. That's it. - Damn! - This is for Vanessa's own good. She's difficult in understanding. She needs to keep things close to heart. She'd wind up telling that detective everything. We have a couple of more questions. - I thought I told you everything about that night. - We just want to know how you are dealing with your fiancee's passing. - I just think of the good times. I like to think we had a wonderful relationship. - He was a lying, dirty cheat. Now he is dead. - Excuse me miss, who are you? - I'm Maggie Johnson. Please leave us alone. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. This is a private investigation. - Sorry. - That's okay. Listen Vanessa. I want you to tell the truth. Like I want you to be totally open. Tell me everything, the good, the bad, and the ugly. You can even ask my ex-wife. Like not every marriage is perfect. You are very positive about him, but I want you to tell me the truth. - Okay the truth. Actually he was never here to fight. I was always alone. I started off alone, so what changed really? Hey, hey where are you going? - I got to go to work. - What do you mean you go to work? You own the company. - I've got to be there. I've got to be there before everybody else and I've got to be there after everybody else. It is just temporary. It is just temporary. I know this is how starting your business goes. It takes a lot of time and lot of money upfront, so I'm gonna be gone a lot. - What can I do? What can I do to make you stay? You stay. - Honestly, I could use some more cash. - What? I just gave you cash. - I know, I know you did, but babe this is how you start a business. It takes a lot of time and lot of money upfront. I've got insurance, I've got rent, I've got payroll. I got to buy equipment, new cameras, new lights. I need employees. - I thought you'd have an income right now. - That's coming babe. I'm doing this for us. But I need it. We need it. This is our business. This is our dream. It's just gonna take a little more time and a lot more hard work to get it off the ground, but when it is off the ground, I'm gonna be sitting pretty. I'm gonna be living a good life. You just have to trust me. But I do need a little more money to get it going. This is the cost of starting a business. I could use 10,000. - 10,000? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, I mean this is, we are gonna make it back. I mean this is just an investment. Don't worry about it. - All right, okay. - Thanks. - Hold on. - Okay. - Jeez. Okay. How much did you say? - 10,000. - 10? - Mm-hm. - 10,000? - That would really help. - You know what I want? - Mm. - To spend more time with you. - I know, I know. That's the goal. We are gonna get there. It is just not right now baby. You just gonna have to be patient. - Well come back to bed for a minute. - It doesn't do me much good like this. I got to put it in the bank. I'll be back for lunch okay? I promise. Thank you babe. Thank you. This is gonna be good. All right, all right, there you go, that's good. Yeah. Stay right there. Nice you are doing great honey. You are doing great. - Give it up. Give her a break. - What the hell is this? We can't afford this. - It is just a little impromptu shoot with the lovely Tabitha here. - Can I talk to you over here? What did I tell you? I told you that there things that we can and cannot do right now. This is something that we cannot do. - Buddy relax. This is not a big deal okay? Bella Sweetheart, can you come over here for a second? Hey. - Hey All right Zach, I want you to take a look at this face and you tell me honestly what would you do? Isn't that what I'm doing. - We'll talk about this later. - Don't you worry about him. He is having a bad day. We'll shoot you next. Tabitha is out of it. - What other skeletons came out of the closet Vanessa? - He was always full of secrets. Always with some place to go. I guess that makes me look really desperate huh? - What did you do about it? - Nothing, she did nothing. She just took it. She believes the best about people, unworthy of that kind of trust. - Did you trust Thomas Vanessa? - How could she? I personally caught him cheating and stealing. He probably did that everyone he knows. Vanessa admit it. Just tell the truth. He was a cheat. - My mother's definition of a cheat is a little different from mine. Thomas was good. You know, he had my heart. I could feel there were other women. - Tabitha, you did great today. You have a such a great look, you are so pretty. Unfortunately this is a tough business and there's a lot of competition out there. And unfortunately I don't think I'm gonna be able to use any of the shots we took today, but you are a very beautiful woman and I'd like to see you again at some... - I was wondering when you'd realize she is no good. - Of course she is no good. You were intimidating her while she is trying to model. Why you do that? - She'll never be better than me. - Maybe three years ago honey. I've got a business to run and I'm gonna need to get some fresh meat in here. You understand? Why you want to slap me? You know you love me. - I could kill you. Hey man. Hey. How is it going? - Good just touching up some of these shots I took today. Look at Bella. - That's very nice right there. - I surprise myself sometimes. - So listen, I just stopped by the bank and there was a little bit of money missing. Yeah I took out 500. - For what? - You know usual, just took a couple of girls to dinner and went to the strip clubs. - You didn't invite me to strip club? - You don't go to strip clubs. - Well you didn't invite me to dinner. - Dude if you are hungry, we've got a kitchen out there. - Okay listen just do me a favor. Next time, can you just, can you let me know if you are gonna do that? I'll just, you know, take a hold of the finances. Yeah no problem. Okay thanks man. - Hey will you grab me a beer while you are up there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Thanks. Wow. You are so hot. Zack? - Hey. - Hey. - I didn't know you came up around here. - Yeah I come here all the time. - I would've figured by now you had sold all your worldly possessions and moved to India. - Oh my god, is that what Thomas tells you about me? - You know, actually how is he treating you? - Actually lately he's been treating me really well. - Really? - Yeah. He just bought me a car. - Really? What car did he buy you? - That car right over there. - He bought you that car over there? - Yes. Wow, he must really like you. - Yeah, I know it was so cool. I was just driving around in my hooptie I was fine, but he was like no baby you need this. I'm so happy that your company is doing so well. Well anyway, I got to get going. - Yeah, of course, of course, of course. Maybe we will rendezvous sometime up there huh? - Yeah we should do that. Every Sunday I come here. - Sounds good, sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. - So much happened that I didn't feel a part of, but I was always a little out of the loop. Thomas could be so wrong in his actions but I was so in love and so not ready to give up the fight. I was down for the ride and he knew it, the long haul. You having sex with someone else? - No of course not. - Just tell me the truth Thomas. - I got to get back. - We never see each other anymore. Don't go. What can I do? What can I do to get you to stay? - I have to, I have to go to work I'll be back later. I'll be back. - No. I'll see you later okay? Have a good day. This man cheated on you. He used you and you did nothing. - Vanessa has a poor way of representing herself. She did everything she could to save her relationship. I helped you. You remember? - I didn't really want to bring that up mom. - Bring what up? - I sent her to someone that could help her realize what was going on. Vanessa likes to wish things away. - I don't really like to listen to cops, but this guy, he was telling some truths. - Don't worry Vanessa. I'll have this cleaned up in no time. Do you always leave your door unlocked? Anyone could walk through here Vanessa. It is completely unsafe to do that. - Is there something I can help you with? - Are you okay? You just seem unfocused. I'm trying to communicate to you. You are just not paying attention. - I got your messages okay? I'm just going through a little something on my own right now. - Vanessa I stopped by because you are not answering my calls. I wanted to make sure you got this very important card. It is imperative that you get a hold of this person. I've pulled a lot of strings. I just want to make sure you have the resources that you need Vanessa. Please! - You know mom, thank you for your help, but I really don't need any advice from your rich friends right now, okay? I just had a fight with Thomas. Yeah we had a fight. That's what you want to see right? That's what you came here for? So you got it, and yeah I'm really upset right now and I don't need you here badgering me about my place of where I live or my relationship or anything like that and I damn sure don't want help from your people. - Vanessa please don't deny the resource simply because it is from me. Always have something in your back pocket. - You know mom, I'm really having a tough day and thank you for your help, but I just kind of yeah. I'm so happy you came to visit Ms. Marie. She doesn't get many visitors. - Well I don't know how much of a visitor I really am. My mother sent me here. I don't know, she thinks if I talk to Ms. Marie somehow it is gonna help me. - Argh, many powerful people just fade away, every day. - Oh, wow. Maybe I can help her. - She just finished her lunch and she will be very happy to see you. She is just over there in the garden. - Cool. Thanks. - You are welcome. - Vanessa. - Hey are you a friend of my mother's? - Nice to meet you. - Yeah she sent me here. She said you were like gifted or something. I thought that was kind of cool. - I knew your mom since before she was born. You are in danger. You are in great danger. Who is the man? - Thomas. Thomas. He is a bad man. You must leave him. - Yeah I know my mother probably paid you to say that. You know I was short of my rent the last couple of months. That's why I'm even here. - You must leave now. You must leave now! - Thank you, I'll call you when I'm finished. - Thanks for coming. - Vanessa honestly where are you living? It was the most disconcerting drive over here. Block after block it got grittier and grittier. - Mom come on, you probably could use a little grit. - Vanessa this is not how we raised you. You were raised with the best of everything. The best schools. - Mom, please not now. I'm hurting okay? I'm trying to keep a smile on but I'm not really feeling that way. I'm sorry you don't like, - Access the trust fund Vanessa. - This is, it is homeless sheek. - Did you just say homeless sheek? Did you coin a phrase for this? I don't want to use that trust fund to buy another car or house. It means more to me than that. - Vanessa I understand your work and I understand that you have passion about that. Use the trust fund to improve the overall quality of your life. You can't continue living in places like this. This is vile. The noise, the dust, the dirt, honestly... - The quality of my life is great. I don't want to access the funds for that. - I'm not surprised that Thomas was murdered here. - I can't believe you just said that. Did you just say that? - I apologize if that sounds insensitive, but it is the truth Vanessa - I can't believe you just... and the truth hurts and lies kill. - I need your support mom. I don't need this. - Vanessa I've never been that type of a person. I love you, but you've got to stand up on your own two feet. You need to be a strong woman in this world. - Don't think I don't know how we've gotten some of our money mom. - Vanessa I've had enough. Don't get disrespectful. - I'm sorry okay. - Fine, that's fine. It is there for your use when you choose to use it, but I want you to start thinking from my perspective. - Yeah sure. No. No! It's that dress. Is it gonna be cold out there? - I'm telling it is Paris. Of course the nights are chilly. - Mm, Paris. Why is it so important for you to go on a mother-daughter bonding trip right? - Darling please hurry. You were faster in track school. - No I'm serious mom. Why do you want to go on this trip? I mean really. - You know that expression. The cat's away, the mouse will play. - Really? Is that it? We got to go all the way to Paris for that? You are really something. You know let me go say goodbye to Thomas and he is not a mouse. Hey. We are leaving. - Okay bye. - I miss you already. - I'm gonna miss you to. - You gonna be good? - Of course. Yeah? - Aha. Bye. Bring me back one of those stripey shirts and some Bagits. - Hey what are you doing here? - I told you I wanted to talk to you alone. - Okay well I thought I answered everything that night. - I have one more question. - What? - Why didn't you leave him? - It wasn't so easy. I was mesmerized. - You think you are gonna leave me? You ain't going nowhere. You are mine. - You don't love me Thomas. - Oh stop that. - It is not me you want. - Of course it is. I know you. I know you better than you know yourself. Everywhere you go, I'm gonna be watching. I'm gonna be right behind you. You are not going anywhere. You hear me? Nowhere. Is that understood? Huh? Is it? What's wrong? What's wrong baby? - I don't think you really love me Thomas. It's like I'm some kind of prize to you. - That's enough of that kind of talk. - Hi. - Oh hey, we've got a package for you. - Oh no, I'm not expecting a package. - You sure? It says package right here for 204. - No, no, no, this is 201. You know I think... - I see trouble for you. - You know what you must do? What you want me to do? - I don't want anything ma'am. I just want to find 204. - Did you see that lady? - I'll find it myself. - I wanted to believe he was being faithful to me but the truth always reveals itself. I was ready for the truth. - Find your power. I knew something was up that weekend, but I wish I didn't have to find out how wrong it really was. Like my mother always says the truth hurts and lies kill. - I've never been to Poland. - Never? It is gonna be a first time. - Oh that's good. Wow. - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's do it again, mm? - I got to go to the office. - What? You got to go right now? - Yeah, I've got to go and I'll be back in 30 minutes. - No, no, no, no. - We will go right back to Poland. You are gonna stay with me. - I'll be back in 30 min, half an hour, just give me half an hour. I'll be right back. - How you doing Thomas? You good? You look good. I just came from seeing Stewart. You remember Stewart? He's our accountant. He handles all of our money. Is there anything you want to tell me Thomas? No? No. Anything? Anything you might have left out to me? Anything up in that little brain of yours? Anything at all? No? Okay, okay. Stewart just told me that half our money is gone. Half our money. I don't want to get mad. I'm a nice guy. You know I'm a nice guy right? I want to keep being nice. You want me to be keep being nice. So you are gonna fix this. You are gonna make this all go away. Okay? That way I can keep on being nice. Because if you don't fix this, I'm gonna have to slit your fucking throat. - Hey baby, oh the trip was so good. I got to say though mom tried to get me with these French guys. It was just like ridiculous. It just made me want you more and miss you more. I like think about with you. When I get back, your ass had better not be here. - Vanessa, you got to believe me. You are the only one. - I was on my way. I had everything I needed to take back what he took from me. But the forces that be wouldn't let his grip go so easily. - Vanessa Johnson? - Excuse me. - Detective Williams. I've just been added to your case. My case? - Don't act like we don't know there is a case pending. - No, there was another detective who... I'm replacing the other detective. And there will be a full investigation. - Hey I didn't kill Thomas. - And now is the time to prove it. I suggest you lawyer up. - For what? - Where are you from Vanessa? I know all kinds of types. - Oh really? You think you got me pegged or something? You don't even know where I'm from. - Rich girl trying to escape her rich life. - Yes, New Orleans exactly and we were not rich. We were wealthy. Is that a problem? - No. I just wanted to make sure that my instinct is correct. - You must think I'm slumming huh? Well, guess what? I'm not slumming. This is me. - This is you huh? - Yeah I wanted to see the other side and the other side has embraced me. I love Thomas. And there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. You could bring all your cops or whatever have you around here, you can tell me to lawyer up or not, but let me tell me something, the truth. The truth will always come out. The truth will always be my freedom. The universe knows that I would never harm Thomas. That I could only love him. If you don't know that, you'll know. - Well we'll be in touch. I suggest you call your folks on this one. - Hello KiKi. Yeah it is me. Who else it's gonna be? Girl can I come over? Yeah. It looks like I'm in a, I'm in a little bit over my head. I need you girl. - Mm, I already told you from the beginning to leave that man alone. That he was no good for you. And look how he left you. - I already got my mom coming down on me okay? I don't want to believe that Thomas was all bad. - You want to believe and trust girl, how much of yourself are you willing to give up for love? - Everything. - Including your freedom? - I didn't kill Thomas. - Girl, what you mean you didn't kill Thomas? Everybody else believes you killed Thomas. That's what everybody is saying right now Vanessa. - No. You know the truth. - I don't know anything. All I know is these people are trying to persecute you right now. - I'll be all right. - Look at this. Even in his death, you pay. And you are supposed to be all right? - Look I feel like the world is coming down on me and all I did was love Thomas. - You are living in a fairy tale land Vanessa. You got to get out of your head. Do you hear me? This ain't the damn notebook. If you don't wake up and see what's going around, you are not gonna survive girl. - All right, all right, all right. Can you give me a break? Can you just be my friend for a minute? - You always got me, but I just don't understand what is going on? Damn girl. I told you you wasn't ready for no damn love. Shut up. We are gonna get through this. - All right come on in. Don't be shy. Was it Jessica or Vanes, you know what? It doesn't matter, all right. So we've got the living room. Two bedrooms upstairs. You look like you might be a single mom. There's a school across the street in case you want to put your kid in school and all. Right this way. White walls. White goes with everything right? And then we've got the kitchen area for cooking and shit and then yeah, so I got to go. I'm running little late. It is my fiance's birthday and we are good. Thank you. - Vanessa. - Detective you made it. - So we find your DNA on the body right before the murder. - My DNA was probably all over Thomas okay, all the time. - Did you struggle? There was a sign of a struggle. - The night that Thomas was murdered was the only time we ever fought, and I tell you I did not ever want to hurt him. - Well he was stabbed Vanessa. - Yes and I have to live with that every day. - You live with that? - Yes I live with that every day because I love Thomas and I'm so tired of telling people that. - Did you love him enough to stab him? - I didn't stab him. I don't know who you think I am. I know that the truth will come forward and the universe... - Still using the universe as the defense. - Yes. Yes I am. - Tell the universe to bring forth the killer or you will be arrested. - You do what you got to do. - Vanessa. - Ms. Marie, you are right. I need your help. - Yes. - I know what you are talking about. Here's what I want you to do. - Are you sure? - Hi. - Hi, I'm detective Williams. May I come in and take a look around? - Yeah. - We are investigating a homicide. Are you familiar with your neighbor Vanessa? - I ain't even know that's her name. - Yes. Vanessa Johnson. - Guess she's cool. - I saw that you glanced at her. It didn't seem like you were friends. - Well she just kind of keeps to herself. Really? - Yeah, her and her boyfriend they don't talk to anyone. - Did you see them fighting? - No. They were just, - They were what? - We heard, they'd always light candles and chant especially her. - And you are linked. - Yeah. I want to say we were friends. - If you remember anything further, go ahead and give me a call. - Okay, no problem. Great. - Oh and detective. - Yes. - I don't know if this helps but I don't think she killed him. She loved him way too much. Thanks. I'll be in touch. Okay. Bye - I saw the change in Thomas. The monster was coming out. I could look into his eyes in that moment and I knew the relationship was doomed. Thomas wasn't the same. He had changed. The monster was coming out. I could look into his eyes in that moment and I knew the relationship was doomed. - They always come back. You? - {Vanessa] You never liked Thomas did you? - He was stealing from us. I'm not gonna allow him to ruin our proper heritage. I can't allow him or you to do that. I need you now. - Mom. Oh my god. - Yet another successful collaboration. - You like dark? - This was absolutely worth it. Vanessa was destroying the family name. 200 years of a powerful legacy, no way I'm gonna allow her to destroy that. - I wanna show you something. - Wait. You know I can't walk. - You don't have to walk. Say hello to your daughter. - No you don't understand. I need all the evil gone. - I'm very familiar with the darkness for which you speak. It is not Thomas. It is someone else. - I know. - Someone else who got me in this change and I finally realize that, finally open up, I want her gone. - I know. - Can you help me? - Yes. - Can you kill her?
