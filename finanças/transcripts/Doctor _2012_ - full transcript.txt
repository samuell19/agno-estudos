DOCTOR Why the look? Is there something on my face? You're just so beautiful... Why would you laugh like that? Excuse me? You just sneered! Sneer? No. I was just happy that... Then why would you sneer like that? I hate it when someone sneers like that when I speak. It feels condescending. Forgive me. It was wrong of me. I hate it when you show your vulgar past. It's just horrible. Got it? Yes. It won't happen again. By the way, this necktie... This one that you picked out this morning? It is so tasteless. I'm sorry. I was going to wear it anyway, but it feels too shitty now. Tasteless! Fuck! Ah! No, no! Argh! This is wrong! Tasteless! Agh! No! I'm sorry for being a prick this morning. No... it was my mistake really. I'm going to be a little late today. I have a surgical patient in the afternoon. OK. Just give me a call when you leave the office, so I can get dinner ready. Give me your hand. You're my everything, so don't let me down. Okay? Okay. See you later. This is fucking hell! Psychopath son of a bitch! I'm so sick of this music! I'm sick of this hairstyle. Much better. I can't breathe... Yeah... He just left for work. The psycho son of a bitch was in a particularly crappy mood. He made me feel like shit. I don't know. How am I supposed to know what he feels? Anyway, you're coming, right? OK... All right... Just get here already. Hey, who's that? Shit, it's Mom. Your mom? What should we do? What do you think? Put your clothes on, quick! - My underwear! - Over there. What is she doing? Nobody home? You! Stop! Move! - What are you going to do? - Catch that son of a bitch! Then what? What? Tell the neighborhood that I'm having an affair? Is that what you want? My god! What's your plan? Do you really want to fuck it all up? Go home if you're here to nag at me. I don't want to hear it. What? I told you not to smoke! I'm only human! How do you expect me to cope? You're the one who made the choice. Why are you all of a sudden like this? I didn't know he would be this much of a pervert. Every day! This same hair, this same expression! I'm about to lose it! Nobody's asking you to live like this forever. In a few years, you can divorce him. So you can at least get some decent alimony. Didn't you get enough? You bought a house, a car,... Try putting on a show every night, naked, doing what he tells you to do. Do that and then see if you can last another day. I'm going to divorce soon, OK? Hello. Hey. Oh, these are for you. Thanks. Excuse me, sir! Your membership card? Is this your first time at our club? Are you here to sign up? That guy who just went in... Oh, the trainer? Trainer? He works here? Yes, but why do you ask? Uh, never mind. Good morning, Dr. Choi! Dr. Choi... Come in! Are you alright? I had to run because I was late. That's it. Oh, okay. The eyelid surgery patient scheduled for this morning is waiting. Do you want a minute? I don't need a minute! Get it ready, now! Okay. Scalpel! Hold on. What's wrong? I have to tell you something. It'll only take a second. Just a minute, please. What is it? Did something happen to you today? What are you talking about? Your hand is shaking. Shaking? My hand? You're wrong. No. I'm sure I saw your scalpel shaking before the patient's eye. Are you saying I have a damn hand tremor? No, it's just... Have I ever made a mistake with a patient? Answer me. Have I? ... No... Then shut up. Come in. Scalpel! Dickhead! What!!! Oh look, the eunuch has a shaky hand. You bitch! Dr. Choi! Dr. Choi, what's wrong? Please! Doctor, calm down! What is wrong with you, sir? Let go! Let go of me! What is wrong with you today? Pull it together! - Ms. Jung! - Let go of me! Ms. Jung, just a minute. Ms. Jung! Hey, what's going on? That doctor is fucking crazy! Crazy! What? Ms. Jung! I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding... A misunderstanding? Do you see this? What the hell is this? That doctor tried to choke me! Look! Is that true? Why would I lie? You all saw it! No, it wasn't like that... Where is this sick bastard! Hold on, where do you think you're going? You piece of shit! You son of a bitch! Why did you do it? Did you try to kill my girlfriend? Speak! - I'll kill you, son of a bitch! - Calm down. Sir, please calm down. Let go of me, I mean it! Hey, you come here! What kind of sick hospital is this? I'll sue your asses! Consider yourselves out of business! We're sorry. Ms. Jung, we are very sorry. - Come on. - We're sorry. So sorry. Sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry. Ma'am. You're going in? It's been hours. We cancelled all our afternoon appointments. We can't just wait around. He told us not to come in. What if he gets angry? If he gets angry, he gets angry. Just leave it to me. D, Dr. Choi. Are... you okay? Why? What are you talking about? Huh? Are you going to keep blocking me? You're leaving? Is there any reason I shouldn't? No... no. But if you just leave like this... I'm going. So you guys leave when you're done, too. Got it? He's lost it, hasn't he? What's wrong with him? He was acting even crazier in the operation room, right? I doubt he's crazy. It's probably a momentary response to some kind of shock. Shock? What kind of shock? How am I supposed to know? I've never even had so much as lunch with him during my 10 years here. Come to think of it, we've never went out for a meal with the doctor. Tomorrow, we'll know if he's really crazy. Let's go, girls. Yes. Here's the fish stew and side dishes you ordered. You said 37000 won, right? - Yes. - Just a minute. Thighs together. Yes, straight up. 2, 1. A little faster this time, 2. You really have a great body. Mr. Kim... What is it? Somebody's here to see you. Me? Who? I'm not sure. She didn't give me a name, just said you would know. Yeah? I'll just be a minute. Hello. Son of a bitch! I'm so sorry. You're aware of what happens to guys who mess with married women? I'll make it simple. I know everything, so don't dream of seeing her again. If I catch you again, I'll kill you. Understand? Ha... pimped your daughter out, but you're still her mother, huh? Just when I thought I'd finally get to live a little thanks to her, she has to do this. She just had to take after my temper. What's he doing here? I'm coming. Come... on in. How have you been, Mom? Oh, me, well... but what brings you here? Not glad to see your son-in-law in such a long time? No, no. It's just so sudden, that's all. Come on in, please. You're sure everything's alright? Why wouldn't things be? I just stopped by. Just? I feel like I've been a little neglectful. Don't say that. You've done so much for us. That's nothing considering the wonderful daughter you gave me. You're too modest... Come, come sit. Come here. Would you like something cold to drink? No, thank you. I've had plenty. Still, let me get you something. No, it's fine. Please sit down. And Soon-jung is doing well these days? Yes, she's great. All thanks to you. I haven't done anything. Actually, I just came from your house. My house? Yeah, I brought over some dishes you like. You did? Then, I came just in time, too. What do you mean? I wanted to give you a gift. A gift? A little botox for you. What? Oh, no really... Didn't you mention it to Soon-jung a few days ago? That you wanted to look younger? She shouldn't have told you that. That was just talk. Something good should come about from having a doctor as a son-in-law. I have everything here, so don't decline. - Oh, well... - It'll be over in a jiffy. You could 've come to the hospital, but I thought you 'd be more comfortable here. I just happened to have the time. There's no need to be in such a hurry. You just got here. No sweat. This is so simple. Still... Lie down here. I hope I'm not being too silly here. Here? Yes, just make yourself comfortable. Thanks. You'll feel a pinch when it goes in. Close your eyes. Go ahead and open your eyes!! You're worse than her. You worthless bitch! Hi. You're home earlier than I thought. Yeah, the procedure was much easier than I thought it would be. That's good. There was a switch of patients at the last moment. Otherwise it would've been difficult. I see. Here. What's this? I got some meat for us to eat. Really? You don't even like meat. I was coming home, and you came to mind. I bought it for you. It's very special. Special? You'll know, when you taste it. It'll be fantastic. Do you want me to prepare it now? Of course. Get the wine, too. I'll be right out. So many ways of being an asshole. I just cooked everything... I fucking hate this. Smells pretty good, doesn't it? It doesn't seem like sirloin or tenderloin. What is it? It's from the thigh. What? It's the inner thigh of the cow. It's rare. It is? I've never heard of thigh meat. That's why it's rare. First, have some wine. Okay. Cheers. Hey, it looks like the meat is ready. Try one. Any good? It's nice. It's different. Yeah? Well, enjoy. Why am I the only one eating? Have some. That's okay. I don't want to. Why not? I didn't bring it for me. You know I don't like meat. Come on... I can't eat it by myself. Have some. Don't mind me. I'll have some later. Go on. Don't burn it. Burnt beef tastes bad. Crazy cunt! You think you're eating beef? This isn't beef? No. Why would you lie? If it's not beef, what is it? You're dying to know, aren't you? I'm also dying to see your face when you find out what this is. Do you want me to tell you? About this meat? That's your mother's ear. I took it as a souvenir. And the meat you ate is your mother's thigh. You just ate your mother. Feels like shit, right? That's how I felt this morning, because of you! Dirty whore! You cheat on me? In my house? You didn't think I'd know? The house reeks of his smell. Your body, my bed, even the bathroom. Skank. I take in this vulgar thing and make you decent, and this is all the thanks I get? Don't come close. I'll kill you. Kill? Me? So you were planning to kill me with that guy? No, don't die already. All that pain you've given me, you can't die this easily. Don't die. Don't die! No! Don't die. You're going to become a flower. I'll make you into a flower. Then you can quietly sit by me. That's what you should've done. Like a penniless rake who with kisses and bites Tortures the breast of an old prostitute, We steal as we pass by a clandestine pleasure That we squeeze very hard like a dried up orange. If rape, poison... We have a folded eyelid and then a jaw procedure. What do you want to do? I told you to cancel today's procedures. Will it be okay? Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Morning! Yes, wonderful morning! You look good today. Yes! I feel like I'm walking on air. It seems like you have something to be happy about. Everything's back to normal. Yesterday was hell. That's good. I'm glad you're back. Speaking of which, let's get some work done today. We have to make up for yesterday, right? Are you up for it? That's always been your problem. Your lack of trust in me. Send them all in. I'll do them all! I guess he was lashing out from something yesterday. No, he makes me even more nervous today. Why? He seems even more nuts today. I've never seen such mood swings from him. You don't think he's normal? I think he's manic-depressive. Quite severely. That's a big problem. Who knows? I could be wrong. Anyway, stay on your toes today. Bring the doctor some tea. Yes. That's strange. Why won't you pick up? Hey, it's me. Why aren't you answering? Are you in the shower? Anyway, call me when you hear this. I have to talk to you. I'm in the neighborhood. Okay? You call yourself a doctor? Ma'am, just a minute. This is the craziest thing that's happened to me. Fucking whack job. Ma'am, what is the matter? What's the matter? You send me in to that crack head and you're asking me? Please calm down, and tell us what happened... Let go of me! If you're so dying to know, go and ask the psycho yourself. What's happening? Is he really going crazy? It's certain that he's not well. Shit. You can't just do nothing! We have clients waiting. If you're so curious, you go in. I'm going to go back to my job. Dr. Choi! Dr. Choi! Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch,... Doctor! What? Did something happen with that lady who just left? What do you mean? She was very upset. Upset? Why? She was the one who made me upset! Crazy bitch, crazy bitch... I'm not sure what you're talking about... You saw her. Who wouldn't be upset with that face? Cut and sewn from cheap clinics... crazy bitch, crazy bitch... So? So, I told her that I wanted to rip her face up! You said what? Did I do something wrong? Why are you standing there? Aren't you going to work? Send in the next patient! Yes, sir. Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, Crazy bitch, I so don't like her. Fuck what's wrong with this hand? This can't happen... Come in. Are you going to kick me out like the other woman? No, no. Come on in. Why are you looking at me like that? You're beautiful. What do you want fixed? My breasts. Breasts? They do look a little small. What do you want to do? I want them bigger and fuller. Let's take a look. Hmm. some implants from below... would work. Better texture... better appearance. Are you having inappropriate feelings for me? Maybe. Won't you feel guilty to your wife? Not at all! Why not? I'm getting rid of her. Good morning. You're early, today. Yes. Mr. Kim, hold on. What is it? I forgot to tell you something yesterday. What is it? A weird guy was looking for you yesterday. Weird guy? A man? Yes. He came up to me and asked me what you do. So? So I told him you worked here. But he just looked and acted so strange. How? I mean, he had this big hammer in his hand. He had a hammer? Yes, it scared me, so I was going to let someone inside know, but he just left, so I forgot about it. What did he look like? In his mid fifties. Dressed in a nice suit. Yeah? I wonder who it is? Oh, you got off the elevator at the same time. Don't you remember? He was on the elevator with me? Oh, yeah! I remember! He couldn't be... Is he someone you know? No. Anyway, thanks. What's going on? Fuck, did something happen? This is expensive. Not everyone can have it. This really enhances your skin? Of course. It's made with real placenta. It's very precious. I'm getting this expensive shot for free. This really is my lucky day! Not just today. I like you, so you're now lucky forever. This'll sting. Doesn't it feel fantastic? Why do I feel drowsy? Don't try. It's no use. You're mine now. So you have to look like I want you to. I'll make you beautiful! Good job today. Thanks. They'll set you up for next time at the desk. - Okay. - Good bye. I'm so tired. It's almost lunch time? What to have for lunch... Yes, what is it? You need to go to the operation room. The O.R.? Why? We don't have anything today. The doctor suddenly said he's doing a procedure. What? Young-ran went in to assist. He said the procedure was going to be long, and to send all the patients home. All right. He's going looney. He's completely lost his mind. What are you doing? What do you think? I'm operating! All of this at once? Without an anesthesiologist? Without me? Why not? I can do it. You're mad! What did you say? Stop if you don't want to kill the patient. And if I say no? Then do whatever you want! Crazy bastard. Yeah, it's me. Any openings at your hospital? Try to get me in. I can't stay here. I told you yesterday. The doc is completely crazy. Sick son of a bitch... Patients aren't guinea pigs. He's cutting one up right now. I'm going to report him. He's completely whacked. What a psycho, I'm... Psycho? You're calling me a psycho? That bitch just made me waste my time. What happened to the head nurse? I sent her off. We don't need someone so unrespectful. Scalpel! Music. Charming plastic surgery... let's see... nope, not here. Choi In-bum plastic surgery... That's him! So, he knew who I was. Since when? Fuck! Too small. We're going to have to change the size. Give me a bigger pack. Doctor, I think you should stitch up now. What are you talking about? Blood pressure is dropping. I think it's the excessive bleeding. She's in danger. What do you know? Just give it to me! Now! I'm not doing this! What? Sorry. I quit. Unrespectful bitches must disappear. What is it? I thought I heard something. It's nothing. Ms. Choi tipped something over by mistake. Oh... Don't bother me until the procedure is over. Lock the hospital, too. Got it? Yes. Hello, Choi In-bum Plastic Surgery. Is the doctor in? Yes, he's in surgery right now. How can I help you? So, he can't come to the phone? Yes, the procedure might take long. If you leave a message... No, that's fine. I'll call him later. What's going on? If he's at work, Soon-jung's alone. Why isn't she picking up? That's too small, too. Hmm... this looks about right. No... stay with me. Huh? Stay! Soon-jung, you can't die. You can't. Soon-jung, wake up. Soon-jung, wake up. Wake up. Soon-jung... wake up. Soon-jung... wake up... Please? Wake up. Soon-jung, wakeup. Wake up. Please. Soon-jung... Shit. Well, that was all for nothing. I chose wrong. I guess you're not right. I'm so tired. I'm going home. Damn it. Am I overreacting? What are you doing here? What? Why are you not at home? Doctor. Is that why you didn't pick up the phone? To come here? Doctor, it's me. Nurse Kim. Nurse Kim, my ass. Why are you like this? What's with the clothes? Who told you to wear that shit? Is that what he likes? Doctor... Fucking whore! I shouldn't have chosen such trash like you. You're a failure, so you must die! Die! Die, die! Where do you think you're going? It's not enough that you cheat on me, so you try to kill me? Huh? You bitch! Bitch... You bitch... You bitch... You bitch... You bitch! Soon-jung! Soon-jung! Fucking nut job! Just hold on... Soon-jung, Soon-jung... Soon-jung... Hurry! Hurry! Fuck! Looks like he finished the job all right. What a complete psycho. I think he already split. Is this it? Soon-jung, are you all right? It's me, me. Young-gwan. It's okay. It's me. Don't worry. We're in a hospital. And the police are after him. They're getting him soon. It's all over, OK? And my mom? Did the son of a bitch really kill my mom? It's all because of me. Because of me, my vanity. I'm a bitch. It's my fault... Don't do that. I should've protected you. It's my fault, too. I'm going to take care of you from now on. So don't worry about anything, okay? This is Park Soon-jung before facial surgery. And this is Park Soon-jung who's in the hospital. From this to this? Those are quite some skilled hands. According to the nurse who survived, it took 13 procedures over a period of a year and a half. But the thing is, why would he go through such trouble to live with her like this? She's not particularly beautiful. He's a plastic surgeon. They don't like artificial women. Take a look. What's this? They found it in his study. What... another picture of Park Soon-jung? No, it's a different person. 1986... that's almost 30 years ago? That's why it's a different girl. So, are you saying that Park Soon-jung is a copy of this woman? Something like that. Did you get a hold of who this is? The photo is all we have, so we have to get Choi In-bum to find out more. It's already 2 o'clock? Soon-jung! Why... what's happened? Tell me. Why can't you speak? Soon-jung! Soon-jung, talk to me! Talk to me, Soon-jung! I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! What's wrong? You said you were going to kill me? Asshole. Can't even put up much of a fight. Looking good! Show me some of that power, huh? Like when you were riding her. Why are you so limp? Come on, fight me, you son of a bitch. At least try to beg for your life with that mouth of yours, you bastard! Son of a bitch... Son of a bitch! That finally feels good. No need to be scared. I'm not going to kill you. What good would that do? It's no use. I killed her. She was my first love. My first love... I loved her so much. You want to know why I killed her? I had a crush on her for over 10 years before I finally told her. She just laughed. Like it was nothing. So I killed her. She hurt my pride and I was so angry, I couldn't stand it. So, I killed her. You feel hopeful because I'm not going to kill you? No. That's not hope. It's despair. Pain is for the living. I'm going to die. Why? Because I don't want pain. But... I have to take this face. Don't resist. After all, I made it. For me. If I'm going to be gone, this face should come with me. Right? I'm so sick and tired of this face... What's wrong? What is it? "1 Year Later" Yes, come in. Welcome. Have a seat. How are we feeling, Sung-gyu? Fine. Are you nervous? Yes, a little. I'm going to take off the bandage. Doctor, emergency patient! Doctor, emergency patient! Doctor! What happened here? You're going to have to move your hand for me. Please. It looks very good. I think you'll like it. Can I have a mirror? Sure. That will do... I can start a new life now. Can't believe I almost messed it all up for worthless love. What a fool. Do you not like it? I love it. Except for one thing. One thing? My name. Excuse me? My name used to be In-bum... I really liked it. But, oh well, what's in a name?
