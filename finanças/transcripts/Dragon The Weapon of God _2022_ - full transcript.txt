The tipping Point... Yep... this city, the entire country has its eyes on him. Lucky for us, dealing with pressure is what he does best, even if some of his techniques are known to be a little unorthodox. Wait, so he is buying? I'm truly sorry for the delay ladies and gentlemen, but as an elected official of this city, my priority is and always has been cleaning our streets of criminals, even if that means I'm late sometimes. And currently the reason that we all gathered here today, as you well know, is that our streets have been overrun by scumbags. You mean Blacks? With scumbags Black Order! My apologies, we need to establish a position of force and unity together. And as one, as the great city of New York, I believe that we can show the world what it is to live in a peaceful and safe society that all of us, I am not looking at one woman today. I don't see one man in front of me, that's going home to their family, I see a family of New Yorkers that is growing. We will not let the black order establish a position of fear in our hearts, we will not take them home with us. Our children should able to walk the streets freely with no fear. You should be able to go to work in the morning, have your coffee, go to the store, knowing that you are safe, that your family is safe and that you have a place to come home to. Certain information has been privy to me and brought to my attention by my colleagues. We are currently under attack by an organization which is known as the Black Order. This organization is hunting our law enforcement. It has made it unsafe for you to leave your houses, to go home, to do anything that you used to do, to have a normal life. And before we go any further today, I would like to give a special and heartfelt thanks to my colleagues, Josh and Sarah and one of the finest, most honest and true NYPD officer that I've ever had the honor of working with in the last 25 years of my professional career, Mr. Chris McLaren. And in response to the questions that have been asked to me, we are launching the peace abroad initiative immediately. It is mandatory that they stop and search all African American men and women between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. 25%, 50% no 100% of the attacks and deaths in our city to date, have been committed by African American men and women between the ages of 20 and 30. Sir, don't you think this discriminates against any person of color living within the city? Absolutely not, ma'am What about the issues that started this all? The fact that the cops in the city abuse their powers, targeting and shooting blacks, shooting kids as young as six years old. It's because of that, the Black Order was born. Our police are acting in your best interest to ensure that you can come here today to ask me that question. By doing what exactly? No actions have been taken, no actions as brutal as the Peace Abroad. Isn't it because of this issue that we have such a dangerous group out there? Didn't you actually create this group? If this matter was resolved when it first started, we wouldn't have seen the rise of the Black Order. We will not spend another day of our lives living in fear. The Black Order has arrived! Mayor Foster, mayor Foster, where are you? No more hiding! This is my city! This is my city! I want all the exit locked down, military, NYPD, call me the Swat, call me the Swat, damn it! None of these scums, none of them, none of them are getting out of here. Those bastards came at me, I will show them what true justice really is. There is hostages. They took a hostage and request your appearance or she's going to be executed. Who? Ms. Jefferson. That journalist? Yes. Shoot them, shoot them, shoot them all. Theyre not getting out alive. I don't think this is Josh, they came at me, they came at me. A line was crossed today and I am sending them a message. If you are coming at me, there will be blood spilled on the other side. We are at war, get your prototype ready ASAP. Peace Abroad, Peace Abroad, launch it now! NYPD has full power to act as they feel necessary and no agents will be punished, none will be punished for any of their actions. I'm going to show them what this city, it's police, it's mayor are made of. It's a crazy day, right sir? You can say that again, sergeant. It's not easy doing what we do. No. No, Im a hero for this city, and people tend to forget that. They may forget it. But you keep them safe, and that's what matters. Right, what about you? How are you, how's Grace? Grace is good, she's here with me today actually. We were supposed to have dinner tonight. Glad... Glad to hear it, really. Ah Sir, if you don't mind me asking, do you worry at all that the Peace Abroad initiative might be a little too extreme? They're leaving me no choice. It's the end that justifies the means. You miss a spot. Is everything ok? Yes dad. The hell do you think is this, a playground? I'm sorry Sir, I did not mean. Shut up! Shut up! Sir... You people always find a way to make everything you touch even worse. You are a piece of shit, you'll never be good at anything you do in this life except maybe... just maybe mopping these floors. And your brothers out there, the Black Order, you'll wind up in some shit hole locked up just like them. So get back to doing what you do best clean these fucking floors. Pick up the mop and get back to work! Argh! Grace! I don't tolerate intolerance when I see it. I don't care if you are the mayor of New York City, you're going to apologize to that boy! Everybody back to work. Those are the criminals, those are the criminals we need out. We need to clean the streets, Chris McLaren in my office. Now! Sorry... I'm really sorry for what happened today. Sorry? Sorry? Do you have any idea of what it is to be treated like that, when you're a good man? I saw a man who treated me like I was the worst criminal ever. Well, why didn't you say that stuff up there? Listen, I don't even know what you think we did up there but I don't really care, I'm a grown man. Well, then why didn't you defend yourself? What do you want me to do? To give them a reason? So they can lock me in. That's what they're looking for! Why? Why what? Up there... I didn't do it for you. I don't stand for injustice and intolerance. Thank You. Daughter of one of the best cop in the city, I guess it's in the genes. Wow, your dad is a cop? Now I should definitely stay away from you. I gotta go, I lost my job. I'm gonna go look for... Are you looking for a number? Like a lotto number? I don't know, do lotto numbers have 10 digits? 347... One second, one second... 347 681 You know next time you could just say: Can I have your number? Jake. Grace. Who is that, in the frame? My daughter. How old? Three. Imagine, with any bad luck, she walks out of her school in her cute little new dress and Booom... dead. A thug comes out of nowhere and shoots her in the head. I'm not following you Foster. It's exactly what will happen if you don't get it ready. They are out there, acting above the law. It's only a matter of time, this is her faith with the Black Order, everyone's, to everyone if nothing is done. Our city, it's our city, our city is under attack and I'm tired of waiting. Now... now listen carefully and listen good. We're doing our best. Are you kidding me? You came for an update, here it is! Foster, you know what? You used pretty unorthodox manners to get what you want, but my office is not a playground for one of them. When I came to you last year with what we are building, you said no. Now we are the only ones who are able to bring your vision to life. So I demand a minimum of respect in these walls. Now, now I see who I need to talk to around here to get some answers. So that's what he looks like. Where did you find him? Roosevelt, during winter, frozen, our team did its best to bring this temperature back but his body refused. What's his name? The mirror of death. You did it! Sup man? Ah, man. I got fired today man. I mean technically I left. No. no no no no, You? Leave a job? You gotta be kidding me. Tsk. I wish I was man. I still wonder how do you even keep paying rent, like how do you do it? You see, you call that the Miles Way. Oh man. Foster man, he humiliated me today. He treated me like crap. I see. Ah, that piece of crap. He was all over the news today. Luckily, the Black Order exists. Not this again man. What? We can't trust the police. We? People like us? That's why the People Police is here. The people police, they keep killing innocent hard working police officers man! Innocent? You keep having your butt stuck in your ears brother. So let me slap it back into reality. Don't you see what they're doing to us, to our people, to kids? The only thing I see is someone who supports criminals. My man we both know who the criminals are. Forget it man, forget it. Jake, just relax. Alright? Just smell the roses and breath those amazing times we live in. Yo, you gotta check out Bulma, she is going live in 20 minutes. I'm good. What? I said I'm good man. What? Gucci like chi!!! Oh man, there is something else I wanted to tell you. No way! What else does this imbecile said to you? I have a date man. Forget about it man. Oh wait, I mean, are you serious? Since I have known you you've been on what... you never even got one girl. You are making it worse, forget it. Don't be mad I'm just joking. Hey, why didn't you stand up for yourself the other day when Foster came at you. Listen Grace, when I was a kid, my dad used to beat me and my mother nonstop. So I grew up, with enough violence. I'm gonna go to the restroom. I'll be right back. Oh my God, the People's Police queen Imani herself. Who is this? The second in Black Order, her man is the leader. You gotta be kidding me. What is she doing here? Someone is actually sitting in that chai... Do you believe in faith? You know what I think you should.. Faith has a way of sneaking up on us at any moment, it's up to us to seize it. You know what, faith is about to get her butt out of that chair. Join us, join in Black Order. Your criminal organization? You know what? I'm good. If there was any cops here I would have gone to them and report you. You would have gone to them and got shot. Oh my Gosh, not this again, you guys are a bunch of criminals, you understand?... Who use the situation to create crimes! Young soldier, don't you realize that they're killing our people, our children. That's because you guys keep attacking them! Does that justify killing a 6 year old? How is a 6 year old a threat? Listen! The police, they're here for our safety, they're here to protect us from people like you! You mean like you. This city needed a hero, someone to step up, and that's what we did, that's why the Black Order exists. Don't you want to do something to how Foster humiliated you the other day? How do you know about that? Is everything okay? Yes, Ms. Imani was on her way out. Here's a number to call in case you change your mind. Perfect. Now I know which number to call now to get your pretty face behind bars for all the crimes you committed. Who is this? Apparently one of the leaders of the Black Order. I see why you like cops so much. Dating the daughter of one of the best officers out there. Excuse me but my father is a hero who puts his life on the line every day to save lives contrary to you who just takes them. I just wonder how she knew about me. Like how... how... You know what, you need some fresh air. Let's go somewhere else. Thank you for today. I've never had so much fun in one day. Same here, it feels good to just escape this city's craziness, you know. Wow, so now I'm just an escape, Oh I see. That's... that's... that's not what I meant Grace. It's not what I meant. Grace you're more to me than that. Then what am I to you? Grace... there's something I want to tell you. Tell me. Good night. I wanted to tell you good night. Good night. Grace... Good night. Good night. Pretty late little lady, got a new man in your life? Yeah. Wait what? Really? When am I gonna meet this guy? I'm sure you'll love him. Pleasure to welcome you to Hong Kong Mayor Foster. I hate travelling, this better be worth my time. Foster, this is worth the money in your bank. Found in the mountains of Law few months ago... Wait stop, just stop, why couldn't we just make it in New York? I had to travel all the way to China for this? You definitely don't understand the power of what you are buying. This will fix any problem you may have. You know exactly what I'm exterminating. Just don't smash another kid photo frame for your circus of proving points when we get in there. Do you have a problem with the way I'm running my city? Many are starting to think you're losing your mind. Do you just? We are private contractors, you pay us and we deliver, opinions are not part of our vocabulary. Then keep your dirty tongue in your goddamn mouth and deliver me what I ordered. Surprise, right? I speak a little of Chinese, it helps when the time comes. Now show me what the hell I came all the way from New York for. We're here. Sorry Miles, I'm late. Late? The party is over. Man, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be late especially on your birthday. Shut up. How was it? The date. It was pretty good. Ahhh! I am proud of you my brother, you deserve it. But did you smash? That's why you're late. I see. Of course not man, I'm not like you. Oh you're lacking in experience my boy. If I had a chance to take Bulma out, she would've seen the Anaconda dancing countless times. You know what I mean? Man, thank you, 3 years of amazing friendship. Thanks for being with me during those crazy times. Bro of course, remember when we get older each one of us gets a house near the other and... I'll name my son Miles. And I'll name my son Jake. Well well, look at here, what a coincidence. Gosh. The pow pow pow... Shut up. You didn't learn your lesson did you? Remember me? I ain't scared of you homie. You think you can do whatever you want, you preaks! Whoa, did you just attack me? I think, I think you did. Now anything I do is self-defense. See this badge here, we're the only citizens who can shoot who we want and how we want... Hommie. So lower your damn voice! Piece of... let's go, let's go. Miles... Miles... Miles... At last, the dragon comes out. What a day, I mean what a night! A dragon young man you are, yes, but not yet. You can control fire but that's the second level you will have to master. Come, we don't have that much time. The eclipse is forming, a team of extraordinary individuals, is being formed and you are one of them Dragon. A new hero is rising. God's favorite weapon, only an animal can bring... He's gone. Oh, well. At last... I think you use that phrase a little too much. At last? Shouldn't we go after him? At last, matter the word isn't, when the young dragon is ready, he will come to us. Come on Foxy let's go. Kitty is waiting for us. I love Kitty! It's me, it's me, it's me. Jake? Jake what happened? That car... that car Calm down, what happened to you? You are covered in Jake, what happened to you? This isn't the worst thing that happened tonight. This is insane. I know. I'm sorry for your loss. He was my best friend. He was the only person in the city I could count and trust, now I have no one. I'm right here. Don't blame yourself, it's not your fault. There was nothing you could... It's Foster... he would pay. He would pay for Miles death. Matter of fact, he is going to pay for all the other deaths. Everyone who lost their lives, loved ones, due to his cruel leadership and unfair police brutality. Imani was right. No, she wasn't. You can't... That's that's what she wants you to think. You can't understand the pain that I'm going through right now. Nobody can understand. That's how I felt in that restaurant, when she came to see me. People ignore this issue, you know why? Because they cannot feel that pain, that unfair burning fire inside of you. So now you're going to become one of them, killing people, killing innocent cops, killing my dad! Grace, how can you think one second... I thought you were a good person. I am a good person. Then prove it. One bad apple in the basket and all of a sudden you want to throw the whole basket out! No, but one bad apple in the basket and the whole basket goes bad. That's why we need to eliminate the bad apple, Foster! I have nothing to lose... long time, families cried for help, brothers and sisters, they cried for a hero, for someone that can come and make a change. Someone that has the power to do something, let that be me. Jake, listen to what you're saying. You're going to go up against the Mayor of New York City. Grace... I appreciate your worries. But he took everything, he took the most important thing in my life after my mother. There is no going back from here. Where do we start? What? You're going up against one of the most powerful man in New York City. You're going to need help. No... no... no Grace, this isn't your fight. You are... ...I'm white? Jake this isn't a black versus white fight. A psychopath is running our city. I've always looked for an opportunity to fix things, to do what's right and this is it. This is my opportunity. So let me ask you again, where do we start? We are joining the Black Order. I don't think this is a good idea. I'm white. No kidding, really? I thought this isn't a black and white fight, it's about justice. I didn't know we were joining a bunch of criminals. Grace, we are not joining the Black Order, we are only collaborating with them. They fought Foster for so long, they have enough information on him, trust me. I think this is the address that she gave me. Sir, we are looking for sir, we are here for the... Yo speak clearly cause I can't understand what the hell are you saying. We're here for the group the... the group... Group? Why does it look like a boy band to you? Looking for a group, to join a group? Yo, listen, I don't have time for this. Alright? I am kinda busy right now... We're here to see the Black Order. Come here. Hey, watch your manners, okay? You're talking to me right now? I can do this? Well, nice welcome upstairs, my fist just showed this gentleman some manners. I see that you believe in faith. I knew that you will join us. And what is she doing here? She stays. No, this group is only made of brothers and sisters. I said she stays, I wouldn't say it twice. My dad is a cop, I have some intel that could be helpful. And how do I know that this isn't a trap? Yesterday, 11:43pm, I saw my best friend being killed by NYPD officer. I saw him losing his life in front of me. He died in front of me, so I don't care. Okay? I don't care if this is a trap. All I want is Foster. I'm so sorry we lost another brother. I'm sorry for your loss. That's enough. I thought that cops were here for our safety. Listen, I'm not here for debate. Then why wouldn't you admit that cops are the only legal gang out there killing innocent people. We are not going to destroy the entire basket, what we're going to do is get rid of the bad apples that contaminate all the others. I'm confused. You're not the only one. What are you talking about? You want me on board? I'm in. I am joining the Black Order. Two conditions, one, she stays, two, no more killing NYPD officers. And why would we do that? Come closer. You never had a soldier like me before. With me, the Black Order is going to a whole new level. Okay. But what are you? Call me Dragon. Okay. Let's get this monster. We have reason to believe that Foster is up to something, we just don't know exactly what. Luckily his Peace Abroad program has been rejected. So Foster flew to Hong Kong yesterday and we have reason to believe that he went there to get intel on a way to eliminate all of us. All of us? African Americans... whatever he finds he's going to bring to some mysterious dinner party tomorrow night. The George Freeman Dinner. What? The annual NYPD dinner. And how do you know that? My dad is going. Then how are we going to? You and I are going to go to the dinner. But what about your father? It's time for him to meet and accept the man that is in my life, regardless of skin color and it's time for me to stand up for what I believe in. And that's this: I am going to introduce you to my father and everyone as my boyfriend. Perfect, you two can go get the rest of the information that we need. Well in this case, it's time to suit up. This is the first time I'm gonna see him since the humiliation. Jake, I know you're emotional right now but please try to control yourself. I'll be fine. Remember, we are here to find out what Foster is planning. I want Foster and I will make him pay for what he did to Miles. After we find out what he's planning. You know, Miles used to always tell me to go against Foster, always. Take a stand, do something. I never did. If I did, he'll be alive, right now. People always go beyond when things get extreme. Sometime it's too late. Are you guys gonna kiss or what? Or she is friend zoning you. Oh, friend zone. Wait, what? It's not like this. I know, I couldn't. Well, you seem to be doing okay from the last time I friendzoned you. It's not what you think. Oh brother, listen, you need to man up, man. Cause trust me, she's not gonna be single for a while. To the Black Order. What a beautiful night. Two for five, two for five... Yo, it's not even like that my man. He just got friend zoned. Can you stop with this? It's alright man, you probably just not her type. I'll take her off your hands for you. You put a finger on her, and you get all your fingers squeeze and cut in your butt! Tough guy ah. It's alright I will have her one day. Yo, how are you selling two for five when you only got one? What's up with you man? Good to see you sir. Agent McLaren, the best of the best, thank you for everything you've done for this city. We need more heroes like you. Thank you sir. 100%, look... where is Grace? Isn't she joining us tonight? Yes, she is, she's running late, she's bringing her new boyfriend. What news, what news, I can't wait to meet the man who stole the heart of my number one cop's daughter. He must be one hell of an individual. Yeah, I hope so. Should we go in? Yeah let's please, I have a huge announcement to make tonight, we're cleaning this city once and for all. Who's that picture on your desk? It always has the frame turned away. A flower before it becomes a rose. So when are we meeting that secret boyfriend? Here she is. Grace, what is this? Dad... Wait, what are you doing? I'd like to introduce you to my boyfriend. Is this some kinda joke? Because it isn't funny. Dad, I would really like to introduce you to my boyfriend. Grace what is going on here? This thug has no place here. If he has no place here, then I have no place here. I love him and I want you to accept. Look, I don't know what you did to my daughter. It's ok Chris, let them in. Have we met before? Your face looks familiar. Of course, we did. I don't recall, I only remember people that matter. Why do I feel such anger? Why do I feel death? How are the blacks doing by the way, mister? Being killed by psychopaths dressed as cops? All species will never be equal. History has shown us time and time again. Why one species has the privilege to decide the faith of the other. Tell me. No, no one, no one does. It's the inferior species and they decide by their actions, actions speak louder than words, louder than looks, louder than race. Action speaks louder than guns, badges. Families are crying right now. You know what? We have something that you would never have. And what's that? Brotherhood. You think you people know something about brotherhood. You know nothing, I would die for any of the people in this room. And it has nothing to do with guns or badges. Dad... stop disrespecting my boyfriend. Disrespecting? You disrespect me by bringing him here. Tonight, of all nights, if your mother was still alive... She would be ashamed of the man who is sitting in front of me. Oh shut up Grace, you don't know what you're talking about, your mother would never approve to a thug like this. Thug? Why do you keep calling him a thug? You don't even know him, how are you gonna judge him based on the color of his skin? We should eliminate him. You can't just talk about my boyfriend that way. Sit down Grace. You are embarrassing yourself. So? Miles! Speak up, speak up, speak up kid. I think, I think, I think I remember where I know you from. Miles Brown! And who is that? A man who crossed the path of death under your cruel leadership. My leadership is cleaning the streets of this city. I'm a savior, I'm the savior that these people want. I am the savior that this city wants and needs, they asked for me. Miles... 22 years old he loved playing basketball, you hear me? He loved playing basketball, do you hear me? I hear you just fine, I don't know who that Miles is but trust me, trust me. If God or Jesus or anyone wants to come down give me a second chance I'll be the first in line with my gun to fire round after round, one by one into his head. Until he vanishes, until he is gone, gone from this planet. You crossed the line. May the Dragon have mercy on you. Is that the type of individual that you want walking the streets of your beloved city? Who knows... who knows what they're capable of, what they would do to your wives, your children, your neighbors. They're not civilized, they're not like us. One small problem, just one and they flip like a monster. I let this monster, I let him in to our dinner tonight so you can witness with your own eyes exactly how inhumane and inhuman these people are. Now what I'm about to reveal to you tonight may sound brutal but sometimes the hero has to make some tough choices. And Peace Abroad was rejected. So we're taking matters into our own hands and ladies and gentlemen, from now on, from this day forward, our City's borders are closed. And no African Americans, none will be entering or leaving its walls. You may ask me why or what we are going to do with the ones that are inside already? We are going to hunt them down like the animals they are. We are going to eliminate them, one by one. And how? I have a very powerful tool that I brought back from Hong Kong. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to... What the hell was that? They brought you, they really did. Welcome to my... what do you call it... my home... my new home... do you like it? What happened to him? Justice, the black justice happened to me and let me call the police oh wait! You are the, police the people police, right? You're gonna pay for everything you preak, time to feel justice! More.. more... more... give me some cream cheese and jelly on that! Is that all you've got? Well, justice has arrived you preak. Now it's time to feel some pain. You wanted me here. I am here, now tell me what you are planning. Oh excuse me, forgive me, forgive me, I must have forgot. I must have forgot. The hero has arrived... Jake... Jake right? Dragon. I love it! You and all your friends and all the blacks will soon be gone for good. Lucky for us the bad apple is out of the basket. Are you that naive? You just put it in the basket. What? You people are a bunch of stupid thugs. Generalizing because of the actions of few. A few? Well, I'm burning the basket ...hahahaha it's that easy. Tell us how? Rude, how rude, I wasn't done. You people act like criminals, we stop you, instead of cooperating, you show us your bad attitudes leaving me no choice but to bring out the guns. The guns on a six years old. You have no right! Now from the beginning, from the beginning, there have always been people on top and people on the bottom called minorities. You are just unlucky you are on the wrong side. Now you look at me, you look at us like we're evil, now if you were in our position you'd behave even worse. I didn't come here to hear nonsense. Tell me what you're planning! I'm planning to kill you, your sister, your people, your mom. How dare you talk about my mom? How dare you talk about my mom? How dare you? You're gonna taste my punch! Okay! You took my daughter from me. What? I see her everyday. I have a picture of her on my desk to remind me and fuel me and remind me of who you people really are. You people, yes you, you are a virus in this city and did she ask for this? She was only six years old when a thug came out of nowhere, she was minding her own business and wasn't hurting anyone and he came out of nowhere to rob us. An African American thug! I saw into the eyes of a monster that day. The day my daughter died in my arms. He made me watch Patricia die in my hands, my own two hands, her blood so much blood. Since that day I swore I'd make each and every one of you pay dearly for her death. You are a bunch of heartless animals and now, now it's time for you to die. You want to know why I went to China? To buy something, to buy something to get rid of the Black Order, for good and yes being captured by you was all part of the plan. What is he talking about? Dragon, you... you were the only thing missing when the massacre started. Now that you're here, the guest list is full. He's trying to mess with our minds. Just ask me, just ask me, just ask me the name of the prototype. Ask me! What is his name? The mirror of death. What's going on? What is this? What's this? It's not a it, it's a he. By now most of your friends are already dead. You can't beat me, Now can you? Your punches are too weak, far too weak. You will never win. Now let me show you some real punches. We need to go, listen we need to go, he's more powerful than... he is more powerful than we... we need to go, we need to go! You'll never win, the Black Order will live forever. Your Black Order is already dead and the rest of your kind is next, finish him! Where did they go? Where did they go? Grace, we need to talk. Dad. Sit down. Do you have any idea what you did to me last night? Do you even care? You know who I am and what I represent to this city. Dad, I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to introduce you to the man I love. The man you love? A violent criminal? Jake's not a criminal. Are you blind? You saw what he did last night and the mayor is missing now. Good, the real criminal is gone. Grace, God, do you even hear yourself? You've lost your mind I've worked my entire career to provide for you, to do what's right, to do what's right for this city and they call me the best cop in the city because of it. That means something to me and one night, you've destroyed that. You've destroyed all of it. I'm the one who's responsible for the mayor going missing now because my daughter brought his abductor right up to the table that he was sitting at. Dad, I didn't mean to hurt you. I love you, you know that and I keep asking myself, why you work for a man like that? I work for justice, Grace. I work for what's right. Foster is a monster. He's an evil dictator who discriminates against black citizens like my boyfriend. Don't, don't call him that, I will never accept that criminal as part of the family. Do you understand me? You need to choose him or me! I love him like I've never loved anybody before. If mom were alive, she'd be ashamed of the man you are. Don't you dare bring your mother into this. She wouldn't recognize you. All right, that's enough, listen to me, you're not to see him anymore as long as you're my daughter... I'm not your daughter anymore. Grace! Cut the bull crap, sit down! It's amazing, it's amazing, simply amazing. There I say extraordinary. The mirror of death goes way beyond anything even I expected. So you have the prototype. Yes, yes. and the first... its first mission went flawlessly. How did you get it to come to you? You programmed it. To listen to my voice, it would have been nice, nice of you to share that with me by the way. But, but no but there's more, there's more, he only listens to my voice and as soon as I say his name he shows up. The tests didn't show that. We exceeded our expectations. Oh God... look, we're going to eliminate the Black Order for good and... and he will eliminate every living African-American soul in this city for us. Jess, I need my files ready by tonight! And congrats, congrats you guys give yourselves a pat on the back, it's been an absolute pleasure doing business with you both. Sir, thank God you're safe! Chris McLaren, just the man I wanted to see. I'm so sorry. Why are you sorry? It's because of you that we were able to get to the heart of the Black Order. I don't understand. Chris, you're a hero for this city but there's just there's one more thing that I need you to do. Anything just tell me what it is... Your daughter... your daughter she's, she's dating that guy Jake calls himself Dragon, I need... I need you to bring her to me. I don't follow sir. I hope, you don't have a problem with that Chris. There comes a time in every man's life where he needs to make sacrifices now is your time, our time, now is your time! We need Dragon, locked up or dead, behind bars and your daughter, she's the only link that we have to him, so bring her in for justice. But there has to be a different way. Don't question me! Those are your orders, you have until midnight tonight to bring her in. Will do, sir. We're at war, Chris. We are at war and my daughter is the only reason that we've been able to get this far, to end them all, to end all of this. Sacrifice... sacrifices occur, big sacrifice occur in any victory, Chris, and of all people, of all people I understand your pain. This needs to happen, it must happen, it must be done and may your daughter. May she be the last sacrifice that we make in this war. Now get out of here! It's a change, it's a migration from one soul, from one place to another, Chinese saying. You know, Chinese used to believe back in the days in life after death. They used to bury their citizens with their belongings believing that those belongings were coming with them. Miles is looking at me right now. I can feel it. I can't see him but I can feel it, probably playing basketball somewhere in the sky with his stupid face looking at me I know how you're feeling but they all gone, they've gone to a better world. They're all looking at you and I right now and I can guarantee you they don't want to see their queen in tears. You don't understand, we've been through everything together. I've known most of them since I was a kid, especially Idrisa. I started this organization because we believe we could stop the injustice in our streets, because the police wouldn't do it. And now they're gone and I don't have anybody. Listen Imani, you told me that once and I'm going to tell you that this time this is my turn to say that. We are family. We are here, I am here Imani. I'm very sorry for your loss, I am. Thanks. But from now on, considering me your brother, if you need anything, I'll have your back for the rest of my life. Thanks Jake! You know, I knew when I first met you that you would be a great leader for our people. Which is why I was a little jealous of Grace. She is lucky to have you. Listen, we are going to rebuild the Black Order, you and I together. Together? Together. Oh Grace Grace! Grace. What are you doing here? Get out of my house! Please listen to me. You broke my heart, you tell me you love me and then the same day you're kissing Imani, my God! I knew from the beginning that she was after you. She kissed me. I knew from the beginning that she was after you. She kissed me. Get out of my house. Grace, I love you. I never loved someone like you before I never did, I swear. You're the whole world to me, I love you. No, no, no you're just using me like everybody else does. Gosh, I trusted you, I thought that you were different. I am different Grace, I am different. I love you Grace. Grace, I never loved someone like you before, you made me the man I am right now. Go play with somebody else's feelings and break someone else's heart like Miss Imani. Grace, don't do this to me, I love you. Don't touch me! You son of a bitch! You stay away from my daughter. Dad! You ever touch her again, I will kill you. I'll bring you to Foster myself. Sir, I am not coming with you. Sir, the list of African-American newborns is on its way. It's perfect, we will strike at birth and eliminate every new African-American born today. The bleeding needs to stop at its roots. Any news on McLaren? Nothing sir, we tried calling him like you asked. Hey, hey what we got going over over there? I'm a cop, put your hands behind your back, put your hands behind your back. Don't move! You're a cop? You're a cop? I'm a cop. My name is Dragon. Foster, I know you're watching, I know you are watching this. You have one hour to show up at Christie and Canal or there will be police blood on the ground. You took everything away from me. I'm not gonna hesitate, you have one hour make your daughter proud, come find me. By the way, bring the prototype. Sir it's gone viral, it was just posted a few minutes ago. Look at that, our dear Dragon is making things easier for us. Mirror of Death. They say you can ship yourself anywhere. You shipped yourself from China to New York once. Send me a location. Canal and Christie. I'm coming too. Hey kid, I have powers too. I mean my prototype the mirror of death. Miles... Miles... 22 years old 22 years old What? Who? He loved playing Basketball. Doesn't ring a bell. I'm going to... I'm going to... Kill him! Go ahead, do it already! You asked for it. He's dead Do it! Kill him! What a good... good man you are. Let me ask you something, have you... have you ever killed anyone before? We both know the answer to that, because of people like you that my daughter is dead. Don't kill him, don't kill him, wait! I want you to witness the end and you will, you will suffer watching the city's blacks fall one by one. Thank you for bringing me back. It feels so good to be here. Bastard failed me. I won't. Your wishes are my mission. You're amazing. You have the ability to go anywhere you want, in a matter of seconds. So as soon as Jess arrives with the full list of African-American newborns, I want you to go to each and everyone of them and slit their throats. Breaking news! The fugitive and self proclaimed Dragon has been captured today by Mayor Foster, he is right now captive... This is the kind of man you want? A criminal? Dad, stop, you've been acting weird, where are we going? I want you to know, whatever happens tonight, I always loved you. I know. Where are we going? You're right, your mother would be ashamed of me. Dad, I didn't mean that when I said it. All my life, I thought I was serving justice, I thought I was born to be a protector of the people. What the hell? Who is this? Who the hell are you? I need to talk to you. Wait, you know her? She was the leader of the Black Order. Wait what? Get away from her! I'm not coming here to hurt anybody. I just need to tell you something. How did you find us? I put a tracking device on you and Jake when you first came. Grace, Jake loves you. What are you doing? I saw you two kissing. Yeah, but I kissed him. Look I.. I was jealous. Grace. Why should I believe you? Why would I come here and lie to you? He's only loved you Grace, only you. Jake. Shoot me. What? It's the only way, Grace. I can't take you to them. To who? I'm under orders to bring you to Foster. Dad, is that where we're going? This is your chance, this is your big shot, Black Order lady. You shoot, shoot me, shoot, shoot me in the leg and, and what will say that I was ambushed and that... that's why I couldn't bring you to Foster. It's the only way to keep you safe Grace. Dad, no! You have to stand up to Foster. And let him know that he can't come between you and your family. No, it's not that simple Grace, okay? I serve justice, I have to do what's right. Is justice more important than your family? Is that how mom died? We were driving, we were running late to a wedding and I saw this car and I recognized the plates. He was wanted, I took off after him. Your mom begged me to stop but I couldn't do it. It got out of control, he knew we were following him. I ended up driving off a cliff. It was... It was all my fault. I know. What? I did my research a long time ago. Just been waiting for you to tell me. Dad, I love you, don't make that mistake twice. What would mom want? Grace... They have Jake. Okay... let's go. I can't lose you the way I lost your mother. Get in the car, we're gonna save your boyfriend. Get in the car! Okay, you don't have to yell. What? Nothing. Dad, I love you. I love you too, Grace. This is McLaren, I need to know what the criminal code name Jake has been placed. No? What about Dragon? Let the justice rise. Jake? What's going on here, what are you doing here? We're here to save you son. Grace, I can explain, I swear. Jake, Imani told me everything. Jake, I love you. I'm so sorry. Grace, I love you, I'll love you forever. Alright, we need to get you out of here. Everybody, stay here and I'm gonna go clear the way. Imani, thank you for finding me, faith must have sent you. That's my name. What do you mean? Imani means faith in Swahili. Foster! I need to stop him. He's planning something big. I can't... he's planning something horrible. I need to stop Foster, it's only a matter of time... Mirror of death. You are in my world, you are not able to use any of your powers. I control you and I will finish you. I know I have those powers, I gotta use them. I gotta find a way. I can use my powers, oh wait I can use it. Wait I got it. I see your boyfriend is keeping my prototype busy. Maybe I should keep you busy. You're a monster! A monster? Maybe? Maybe not. What's a monster if not just someone's perspective in their mind, a perception of someone that's unable to accept the actions of another. A feeling in your heart that what you've just seen is wrong or maybe just not your moral code. A monster is just somebody's point of view, you're a monster to me for dating this monster. You are evil... Jake is going to stop you. Oh really, really? Really? Will he stop me from doing this? Your boyfriend has caused enough trouble to my well-being and the well-being of this city. Things look even between me and him now, don't you think? Let us say that I have the upper hand. The prototype may be busy for a while, we're moving to plan B, I'm moving to location Meta. It's all clear, we can get Jake out. No, I'm... I'm sorry, I couldn't do anything. What are you talking about? He came and I saw everything, I'm so sorry! What, what happened? No he... he... he came, I couldn't save her, I couldn't... Grace... Grace no, no, no. What did he do? Who did this? Foster. I can't believe you. Who do you think you are? Barging to my office like that? Didn't you see that I was with clients? Waving a contract in my face saying Josh gave you the angel of death. He's our second prototype, he's not ready. By the way, where are your officers? I'm no longer the mayor of New York. Right because you're a madman. What did you say? You're a madman, the angel of death is on his way, he's going to be here any second. You... you've outdone yourself. I can't even be mad at you. As soon as he's here we're getting down to business. All newborns... all newborns will be eliminated. Do you hear that? Foster! Jesus. Chris! Chris, have you lost your Goddamn mind? You murdered Grace! I didn't murder anybody, I didn't murder anybody, okay? If any sacrifices needed to be made, let it be you man, let it be you. If you're gonna shoot me, go ahead! Oh goddammit man, goddamn man. Another sacrifice... I sacrificed everything! You didn't sacrifice anything. You lost your Goddamn mind. This is how you repay me? You lost your mind and I lost my daughter! Your daughter? Oh, is this about your daughter? You're jealous of my daughter. Wait, is this about Patricia? You have no right. Don't ever say her name! You have no right, yes, yes, yes, she's gone, she's gone, okay? But you, having yours, you having yours, bring her to work, talk to me about her all the time. Because you were my friend. Friend... friend... when the time of sacrifice came, when it came, I had to pull the trigger. I pulled it because you are weak. And now, you are going to join her. Chris? Chris! Where are you going? Foster, Foster, the angel of death is here. We are equal, we are all one, we are all New York, where freedom lives forever, the freedom to be whoever we want to be. You deal with one minority, you deal with all of us. I raised my family here, I own deli down the block. I am a New Yorker and I accept everyone. You come up to one of us, you come up to all of us. You destroyed the spirit, heart of New York. How dare... how dare you go against me? Against the will of my daughter? Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all! Kill every last living soul in this city. Angel, Patricia is dead. It's time for you to kill every beating heart that you feel in this city. Kill every last one, and we will rebuild it from scratch. Is this it? What? I'm Dragon, the weapon of God. Foster your time has come. You took Patricia and my mirror of death! I took two, I took two of your most important lives, as well. The question, the question... the question is which one are you avenging now? Miles or Grace? What did you say? You didn't know? Bummer bummer. I killed your girlfriend. No way. Ah, go easy on yourself kid, go easy, sacrifices needed to be made. Stop messing with me, there was no, there was no way Grace is dead. You can't beat me, okay? I am the savior, I am the savior of this city and you? You still think you're a hero? You think... you think you're a hero? You... you're a villain! You will die, you hear that? Actually you will not die, I will make you suffer, I want you alive to feel it. Okay? I will destroy you piece by piece! You hear that? I will kill you piece by piece, atom by atom. I want you to feel it. What was his name? What was his name? Miles! Miles! What was her name? You let your blindness lose your mind. Why would you do it to Grace? Why you did this to Grace? Why you did this to Grace? Why, why you did this to Grace? Miles, Grace they were my everything. I never had a family, they accepted me for who I was. They accepted me for who I was. I never had a family before. They gave me a family, that's what they were for me and you just took it away from me. You let your blindness destroy you. Is that what will make her proud? To see her dad killing innocents? Is that what will make her proud, your daughter? Why... why Grace? Why you had to do it to Grace? Why you had to do this to Grace? She didn't do nothing. She was my baby, my heart. I wake up every day every day I wake up Is that what your daughter would want? Her dad to be killing people? Is that what would make her proud? Really? That's what you are doing now. Don't you see? People do, they wake up, they wake up and they don't look in the mirror. They just judge, they are judging cops. They are going after African-Americans to, you give them reasons to act. You always give them reasons, sometimes it's just your damn attitude. No... African Americans go against cops because... Bullshit. you keep profiling... Bullshit!. You keep profiling them. Are you kidding me? you kidding me? You're going to play the victim card for the rest of your life, the rest of your goddamn life cause one cop. Somebody made a mistake and then you, you decide they're all bad. All cops are bad. And your father, he tortured you, he tortured you, how bad could that be because you're here, you're here, okay? And that doesn't make all dads bad, me, I was a great I was a great father to Patricia, you hear me? Don't forget it. The actions of few dictate the perception of everyone. My daughter was killed, Dragon. I died a long time ago. My heart was taken from me that day. Jake... I am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My heart... my heart... So this is where we part ways. What are you gonna do, Jake? What I'm meant to do. God put me on this earth for a reason and it's to protect the people that are less fortunate. The city needs a hero and I'm going to be a superhero. And you Chris? What are you gonna do? I don't know. I fought for justice my entire life and it took everything from me. It took my family. I have nothing left, nobody. Same. With Idrissa gone and the Black Order's over, I don't have anything left. I'm sorry for that. Thank you. So... will you fight for justice or injustice? I'm a superhero, I'm going to fight against whoever is evil or goes against less fortunate. Good luck Jake. Thanks. Good luck Jake Thank you. I may need partners. I may need a son. I may need a brother. I may need a family. Grace may have been taken from me, but she brought me you who I'll be glad to call a son. I'd be glad to call you my father, I always dreamed of having a father. I have nothing left to lose, no longer a member of law enforcement I'm on your team, Dragon. Me too. Thanks. Let's protect this city. Now before we start, you guys need something very important. Oh yeah, what's that? Powers? Nicknames. Seriously? Every superhero has one, including me. Yeah, but is that necessary for us? You've never watched or read a comic book? S-man? I'm an adult. Listen, imagine, I'm a villain and I just saw you both superheroes just landing in front of me. I'm going to ask myself, who are you? So before we start. Question: what are your superhero names? Right... since Foster's not the mayor anymore they think they can get away with whatever they want. It's not going to happen on my watch, I fight for justice and I will lock them all up. Where are you off so fast? I got to see my son. Please. You guys committed a crime? No sir I didn't, I didn't. Please... What you got in your pocket? Got a gun? Get on the ground. I gotta see my son. Your son? You're full of shit. You probably committed a fucking crime. We're gonna call these next few seconds self-defense. I don't agree. Me neither. How can I agree to that? Is this guy a fool? Probably. He needs a lesson. Who said that? My name is Dragon, the Weapon of God. My name is Faith. My name is Justice. Oh my god, it's you, the city has been talking about you from left to right. You think you scare me? Just a bunch of outlaws, I'd be happy to bring to where you belong, in jail. May Faith, Justice and the Dragon have mercy.
