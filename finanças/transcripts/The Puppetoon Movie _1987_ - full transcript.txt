[silence] [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] [crickets chirping] [ominous music playing] [crickets chirping] [ominous music playing] [ominous music keeps] [birds chirping] [ominous music playing] [birds chirping] [ominous music playing] [birds chirping] [ominous music playing] [birds chirping] [sudden animal screeching] [Arnie roaring] [continuous roaring] [screeching and roaring stop] [Arnie laughs] Roarrr! [dinosaur coughs] Oh, gosh. This just isn't right. Listen, you'd better run away... I really don't wanna have to eat you. - Cut! Cut! [music starts playing] Stop the camera! Stop the camera! [music keeps playing] Arnie, where does it say in the script to tell Barbara here to run away? - Oh, I'm sorry, Gumby... I just can't do it! You know I don't eat meat. - You don't have to really eat her... you're just acting fer gosh sakes. That's a wrap, everyone... take a break. [foot steps] - Gumby, weren't you a little hard on Arnie? - I've got a movie to make, Pokey... what can I do? - He seems quite sensitive to me. You'd better talk it out. - What's bothering you, Arnie? - I can't play this part, Gumby... it's just not me. - Have you ever had this problem before? - Only once... when I accidentally stepped on a frog. - I don't get it. Dinosaurs like you are supposed to be ferocious creatures. - I know... I was once... [stomps] But then I worked as a stand-in in one of George Pal's movies and I haven't been the same since. - You mean George "THE PUPPETOONS" Pal? How did that change your delivery? - George Pal taught me everything I know. His films were so positive. He showed me that even a villain can have a good side... I guess that's when I became a vegetarian. - Arnie has a good point, Gumby. Come to think of it, George Pal's Puppetoons were a big influence in my life, too. - Oh, no... not you, too! - Sure, Gumby. The Puppetoons is where it all started. George Pal had more to do with all of us than you think. - Really? - You know, without George some of us might never have been born. - Wow, that's heavy... but I still don't quite... - Pokey, I think we better give Gumby a little sample of what I mean. - Couldn't hurt. [music starts playing] [door opens] - Ready, Gumby? - All set, Arnie. - Can you get the lights, Pokey? - Sure. [light clicks off] [film starts rolling] - You watch, Gumby, and we'll talk delivery later. [click] [music starts playing] The story of George Pal, is as unique as any in the magical world of the animated film. George really worked miracles for us. His big idea of animating three-dimensional characters known as PUPPETOONS came to life at his Eindhoven studios in Holland over fifty years ago. [music starts playing] The most impossible visions took the movie screens of Europe by storm. George Pal became the merchant of fantasy to Europeans just as Walt Disney was to Americans. George later went on to the United States and set up the first animated puppet film factory in Hollywood. And a new form of magic was born into the world. - Gosh Arnie, that's really something... but now what? - For the next hour and a half sit back and relax, Gumby... because, THIS IS... THE PUPPETOON MOVIE. [intro music plays] [music continues playing] [violin plays] [motorcycle passes by] Hmmm... Ha, Ha! [music continues playing] Ooh.

And when we board each whaler She would say to every sailor Tell me true Where is my boy in blue? Tell me true Tell me what I can do The truth they never told her But they tried their best to console her. Day by day Until she wasted away. Day by day [bottles falling] [loud crashes] - Til she wasted away She wore a little jacket of blue She kept a little jacket of blue And all the sailors knew That's why she wore a jacket of blue [audience clapping] - I saw the Harbor Lights They only told me we were parting The same old Harbor Lights That once brought you to me. I watched the Harbor Lights How could I help if tears were starting Goodbye to tender nights Beside the silvery sea. I long to hold you near And kiss you just once more But you were on the ship And I was on the shore. Now I know lonely nights For all the while my heart is whispering Somehow the Harbor Lights Will steal your love from me.

Let's take her to the volcano. - Good! [woman yells] - Help! [water splashes] - Over my dead body! - O-kay... [squishing sound] - An island's life's the life for me Where girls are fair and fancy free And all the clothes a lady needs Are a bunch of grass and a string of beads. Ah... a patient. Knock, knock. - Who is there? - The doctor. - Oh, doctor. They take away my girl and I'm too tired to fight. I even wake up tired. - Don't worry, young fellow me lad. I'll soon put you right. Gentlemen, this is a clear case of night starvation. Now, I want you to give him Horlicks every night... [man gulping] Every night mark you... [man gulping] and in six weeks, he'll be a new man.

[wedding music plays] [accordion starts playing] - Phew. [door opens] [feet tapping] [music starts playing] [feet tapping] [feet tapping] [feet tapping] [sudden loud music] [bomb explosion] [screwballs running] [metal rattling] [door and window closes] [airplanes flying] [engine roaring] [bomb falling] [loud explosion] [continuous explosion] [tanks falling from sky] [tank dropping] [loud explosion] [loud explosion] - Janette... Janette! Janette!! [crashing sound] [tank screeching] [melancholic sound playing] [sudden thunder] [raindrops falling] [thunder sound] [metal clanking] [electrocuting sound] [airplanes falling from sky] [crash] - Rust. [running] Rust. [metal clinking] Rust!! [heavy metal crushing] [metal rattling] [accordion softly plays] Jan. Janette! [music starts playing] [intro music plays] [Punchy whistling] - Well, kiddies, once upon a time in a pretty little garden, in a right pretty cottage, a very, very pretty girl named Judy lived under very, very pe-culiar circumstances. Now, this little cutie bug never showed hide nor hair of herself unless the weather was fair. Why? Cuz she worked in one of them... weatherclocks. Yep, yes sir. [cough] Well, right smack dab next door was a young feller named Punchy who also lived under very, very, pe-culiar circumstances. He never stuck his nose outside unless the weather was so bad it wasn't even worth talkin' about. [sudden thunder] Nope, his job was tellin' us what kind of weather we're havin' [bells jingling] [wind blowing] Now this kind of stuff been goin' on fer a long, long time. But even under the most pe-culiar circumstances any girl critter with an hourglass figure wants to make every minute count. [popping sound] But-ah- nothing ever happened. Why? Tell ya. Cuz this young feller had more brains in his little finger than he had in his head. So Judy knows right off that he's kind of a critter that got to be hit by a truck. Yes, sir indeed-de. So, for a truck, she wore some kind of gingham get-up, a cut on a right smark bias, ah with a bare midrif... that means her stomach showed. But, ah, Judy knows that ah, he had a sixth sense... even though there weren't no sign of the other five. So, she hit him again... with a new furcoat... mink, I think. In fact, she was always a-goin' around actin' like a girl, doing all kinds of girl stuff... like drenched in them there sweet smellins like... um... perfurme de la Slam, Bam and a new one called, Wham! Which is absolutely guaranteed to drive us young fellers stark ravin' mad 'er get your money back. [popping sound] But-um- that didn't quite hit the nail on the crown. So, Judy wore blue sweaters to bring out her eyes... [hitting wood] and she smacked him with some of those high octane bathin' bloomers... and that did it. [Punchy springing back up] - Awoo! [punching wood] [Punchy barking] [crashing sound] [suddenly stops] - Nope... No... duty calls. [door closes] Well, things got nowhere fast. Punchy was still in a fog. But that wasn't bad enough. No, sir... a big blow had to horn in... [thunder roaring] [window opens] [electrocuting sound] - Oh! Help! [horn blowing] [Punchy starts playing music] - You know, that ain't bad. [crash] [water running] [clanking sound] [wood breaking] [swooshing] [loud crash] - So, ya know, Punchy took Judy over to his house. But the young feller didn't know what a big step he's was a-takin' over that threshold. Cuz, it only made the very peculiar circumstances more peculiar. [sudden knocking] [door opens] - We are gathered here together to join this boy and this girl... [wedding music starts playing] Well, you know that young feller doesn't know to this day what happened to him... Hmmm... all he knows is... he likes it. Now, when it rains, [ding] why, Punchy and Judy just stay inside... which is exactly what all young fellers and all pretty girls should do when circumstances are... perfect. [music starts playing] [intro music plays] - The whistles was blowin' on the heels of the storm The night was dark-clouded and the weather was warm The tree tops was huddled together in the night. And the wind kinda whispered... like a scared wind might. [wind blowing] - John Henry - It was forty-eight hours from evenin' til morn On that big black night when John Henry was born [woman wailing] - John Henry [thunder roaring] [wind howling] John Henry. John Henry was big. John Henry was strong He was four foot wide And twelve foot long He had muscles of steel He was fixin' to work Just the minute he was born John Henry - My name's John Henry, woman. - Pleased ta know ya son. I's your ma. - And the boy John Henry never lived by the rule The valley was his home and the river his school [train whistling] But when he first saw the railroad with its tracks of steel. When he first saw the engine with its mighty wheel He knew this was his callin' - rail road tracks was his sign And John Henry went to work on the C & O Line. [continuous hammering] - I've been working on the railroad - My name's John Henry. I got muscles of steel and I was born three weeks ago. I reckon it's about time I got around to workin' [hammering sound] - But there was trouble in the offin' For the steel drivin' men For the railroad bought an engine Could do the work of ten An engine that could hammer While the steel sparks flew An engine most inhuman called the Inky Poo [loud hammering] - Whatta we going to do? - The engine's going to take our jobs away! - How we going to drive steel when the engine does it better? - Faster! - Quicker! - Deeper! - Harder! [hammering continues] [engine whistles] - Just leave everything to me. - Whatcha going to do? - Name is John Henry. I aim to show up that engine. - The Inky Poo? - How you going to do that, Mr. Steel Drivin' Man? - With my two bare hands, with my thirty-pound hammers. - But the Inky Poo's an engine... a machine. - You can't beat an engine. The man ain't born that can't beat a machine. - Ain't no machine made can beat a man once a man's got a mind he can beat that machine. [singing] - John Henry - The sun was blazin' from the sky of blue On the day John Henry met the Inky Poo The Big Bend Tunnel was the place they'd set For the steel drivin' race Man would never forget To see young John Henry match his muscles and might Against the Inky Poo in a workin' fight [engine whistling] [audience cheering] [hammering starts] [hammering intensifies] - You can't do it, John Henry! - Got to do it, woman! - But you'll be hurt! You'll be killed! - Stop fussin' at me, woman! I can't stand a fussed woman! [hammering continues] - No, John Henry, no. [fierce hammering] [engine whistles] [audience cheering] - He beat the machine! - He drove more steel... - than a steel drivin' engine. [woman suddenly screams] [commotion starts] - John Henry is dead. [singing starts] - John Henry was big John Henry was strong He was four foot wide And twelve foot long - No, John Henry, no! He picked up his hammers And laid 'em down And he never got up From the cold, cold ground. - Now, you know and I know History has a way Of makin' big men bigger And strong men stronger. And even if John Henry wasn't as big As the stories say he was big Or as strong as stories say he was strong He was still a mighty man A steel drivin' man Who worked with his hammers In the Blazin' Sun AND IN THE POURIN' RAIN DRIVIN' HIS STEEL - BUILDIN' THE RAILROAD BUILDIN' THE COUNTRY That's him... John Henry... The American workin' man. John Henry didn't die back there at Big Bend Tunnel. He just showed that a man can do anything that a machine can do if a man only has a mind to do it. No... John Henry didn't die. He just stopped livin' in his mammy's shack there beside the river and the railroad track... and he started livin' in the hearts of men... Forever and a day. [singing starts] - I want to cross over into heaven. [music starts playing] [music continues playing] [laughing] - When we are married They'll be sausage for tea Then we shall be Happy as can be When we are married They'll be sausage for tea Sausage for you and me [plates breaking] [audience laughing] [waltz music playing] [music changing] [orchestra playing] Tonight I mustn't think of him Music, maestro, please Tonight, tonight I must forget Those precious hours No hearts and flowers Play a lilting melody Jazztime, Ragtime, Swing Any old thing to help me ease the pain That solitude can bring [music keeps playing] [intro music playing] [popping sound] [heavy rainfall] [cars passing by] [loud thunder] [sudden thunder] [clocks ticking] [popping sound] [swooshing] [tugging] [sudden crash] [cuckoo] - Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve... [cuckoo] thirteen! Oooh!! - Now once there was a little old man With a funny, crooked nose He ran an old time pawnshop And they called him Old Man Mose One night, when he was closin' up There was a stealthy tread Someone stole up behind his back And smacked him on the head Now, I believe Yes, I believe I do believe That Old Man Mose is dead [continues tugging on door] [piano starts playing] [music plays] [smacking] [trumpets playing] [trumpets playing] [trumpets playing] [thumps] [growls] [trumpets playing] [bangs] [stomping] [music intensifies] [tugging on door] - What's goin' on in there? [knocking] Open the door! Who's makin' all that racket? [shuffling] Wake up. [swooshing] You alright Moe. - It was quiet around here until you come along. Just enjoying a quiet little nap. [yawns] Good night. [intro music playing] - Once upon a time, there was an orchestra which was all busy tuning up. First, the oboe gave his A. To the strings. To the woodwinds. To the brass. Up and around the scales they raced, helter-skelter, faster and faster. [music playing] All but Tubby the Tuba. A fat little tuba... Puffing away... But, oh, so slow. - Oh, what lovely music. Thought Tubby... and sighed. - Well, what's the matter? Said People the Piccolo. - Oh... Said Tubby. - Every time we do a new piece, you all get such pretty melodies to play and I... never, never a pretty melody. - But people don't write pretty melodies for tubas, it just isn't done. [conductor tapping] Oh, there's the conductor. Sssh! First the violins danced the lovely little tune. [violins start playing] Then the woodwinds picked it up. [woodwinds start playing] Our turn tooted the trumpets. [trumpets playing] And the rest joined in! [orchestral music playing] [conductor tapping] - Tubby... said the conductor. Tubby! - Whew! - Tubby, what's the matter? - Please, sir. I thought it would be so nice to dance with the pretty little tune instead of going, oom-pah, oom, pah... all the time. - Dance... laughed the violins. - Dance, well really! And the french horn put his hand to his mouth and snickered. The whole orchestra began to laugh. [laughter] - Stop it! Cried the conductor. Stop it, I say! Tubby! - Please, sir. I wasn't laughing. [music sheet closes] Rehearsal was over and Tubby went to the river and sat down on a log and looked at himself in the water. - Ah, hmmm. [clears throat] Barg up, barg up. Lovely evening. Barg up, barg up. I said lovely evening. Clunk, clunk. Clunk, clunk. I said beau-ti-ful evening. Hello, bug up. Hello, bug up. Hellooo. - But, Tubby just sat. - Oh, well, if I'm not wanted... [water splashes] - Oh! Cried Tubby. Please, Mr. Frog, please come back. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be impolite. - Oh, that's alright. I'm used to it. No one pays any attention to me either. - Really? - Why, of course. Every night, I sit here and sing my heart out But does anyone listen to me? No. - Can you sing? - Can I sing? Listen. [frog starts singing] - Oh! That's lovely... said Tubby. - Now, you try it. Said the frog. [Tubby claps] - Oh... thank you. Said Tubby. [Tubby starts playing] - Say, you're a very fine tuba. Do you know it, Tubby? - You know, you should try that with your orchestra sometime. - Oh, I will! [swooshing] Goodbye, Mr. Frog. And off went Tubby as happy as happy could be. The next day the orchestra was busy tuning up and buzzing with excitement over the arrival of the great new conductor, Senior Pizzacato. [orchesta playing] [clapping] - Alright! Begin! [Tubby starts playing] - Oh, that wretched tuba. - He'll disgrace us! - The trombone struck out its tongue. And the trumpets snickered. - Tubby! Said Senior Pizzacato. - Tubby. I've never heard a tuba play a melody before. Let's hear the rest of it. - Ooooh... Said Tubby. [Tubby continues playing] - Why, how perfectly wonderful. - Please, Tubby, may we sing your song too? [violins start playing] - How about us? Cried the xylophones. [xylophones start playing] - And me! Said the trombone. [trombone plays] - May I? Said the Celeste. [Celeste starts playing] - Here I come. Said People. [Piccolo plays] - And they all played! [full orchestra playing] - Well, we've done it, haven't we, Tubby? We have our points too, don't we? - Oh... how happy I am! [music plays] - Where's Gumby? - Hey there, fellas! Here I am! - Gumby? How did you get in there? - Be right out, fellas. [light switches on] [pop] - Sorry for getting carried away, but I just had to get into the act. - Well, I hope you now understand why I can't eat little Barbara here. - Sure, Arnie... instead of having her for dinner maybe you should take her out for dinner. [laughter] - Well, Gumby... we'd better go out to the set and finish your movie. - Right, Pokey... come on everyone! [door opens] OH, MY GOSH! - Hi... [giggles] We came by to thank George Pal, too. [xylophone plays] - George made it possible for all of us to be stars. - George Pal... here's to you! - Thanks, George... - Yea! - Hooray for George Pal! [laughter continues] - George Pal, ha, ha, ha! [END]
