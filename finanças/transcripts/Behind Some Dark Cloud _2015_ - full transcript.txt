[electric razor buzzing] [Jade narrates] All I think about is fucking. [upbeat music playing] Everyone's a child.

She would stick bananas down our throats to perfect our sexual prowess, teach me how to cook low-calorie meals, how to give lap dances. [Gloria] Wanna bet I take this right off again before you do? [Jade narrates] My life has become a series of acronyms and monitored meals, indulgent therapy sessions. The act of observation changes what's being observed. Duh. I'm afraid of being defined by disorders. I can't buy into that concept like everybody else. It's making me crazy here. Until it was feeding tube time, everybody told me I looked great and to keep doing what I was doing. Who doesn't love attention? You're a liar if you say otherwise. I wonder what my folks would think if they knew I learned more about shoplifting, hard drugs, and discreet bulimia than self-help. The only thing I really miss is being alone. I wanna be sure about something. I wanna care about something. Anything.

I feel fine. Actually, um, they taught us that "fine" stands for "fucked up, insecure, neurotic and emotional," but, um... but I'm all right. I'm good. Glad you got something out of that place.

[sighs] A young girl shouldn't swear. Sorry. That was common of me. They remember faces, you know? Human faces. You shouldn't cross them. What would happen if I did? They'd call out to other crows, and they'd come after you. Ever wonder why a group of crows is called a murder of crows? They have the capacity for abstract thought. Fun. [Jade] Oh. I just thought they were the raven's mangy cousin. They shouldn't be confused. They're fairly different. A lot of folklore surrounds them both, but even that has gotten confused. See, the crow wants to be near populated areas. And the raven likes to be on his own. I know. What else do you know about the raven? [Jade] Hmm. That it's a rad poem by Poe that my grandpa used to read to me. [chuckles] Then your grandpa has good taste. Yeah, he did. I was really young. I just... I liked the illustrations. John Tenniel did them. - Really? - Mm-hmm. He's the guy who did the "Alice in Wonderland" illustrations. Those were my favorite ones. That makes sense. So, isn't the raven supposed to be like noble and mysterious? I like to think so. They are messengers, though. And sometimes that can get them in trouble. Really? A Greco-Roman legend says they were once all white and Apollo punished the raven by turning its feathers black after it divulged too many secrets. Apollo did them a favor, 'cause they look way cool when they're all dressed in black. You know what's up. Tough crowd. Hey... I know you saw him this time. Can you please just refrain from reminding me that I'm a fuck-up today? [Desmond] Fine. It's just a shame, though. It's like you're afraid to succeed or something. Wow. That is way too profound, Tony Robbins. [chuckles] I always hated finding Mom's self-help books. - She paints her nails on them. - Like Tony Robbins. Seriously?

The Norse god Odin was accompanied by two ravens, Hugin and Munin. Hugin represented the power of thought, the search for information. And Munin, the mind, the ability to intuit meaning rather than hunt for it. They would soar across the land all day and go back to Odin at night with what they learned. Right where we left off. That's impressive. "O'er Mithgarth, Hugin and Munin both Each day set forth to fly. For Hugin I fear lest he come not home, But for Munin my care is more." I think I only have one story about ravens. There was a saint, and when he was martyred, his body was protected by a flock of ravens from hungry vultures. Nature's cruel, man. Do you remember which saint? Um... Saint Vincent. Interesting. May I ask you a personal question? - Sure. - Why do you feel you have to act comfortable when what you're really feeling is a... deep static void within? It's a question for you to answer. You don't have to tell me. It's a question for you. Hey. I'm sorry to bother you, but "a deep static void"? What does that even mean? I mean, I'm not into psychics or anything, and now you've just freaked me out. I'm sorry. I sense things and I... I just hope you figure yourself out. I beg your pardon? I come to the museum to chill out and I always have, and suddenly you're here, and, I mean, yeah, we have nice conversations, but then instead of rudely disappearing this time, you got all weird and you had to tell me what my problem is, which I've had enough of in general. And... [sighs] I just... You don't know me at all. Like at all. So, not cool. You're right. I apologize. I'm sure you're a secure young woman with everything going smoothly. Oh, come on! Really? Fine, man. It takes one to know one. I mean, your void is probably way deeper than mine and like way more staticky, or whatever. I did not mean to scare you, and I apologize.

[Jade chuckles] - [Gloria] Hmm. What? - I think I'm in love. Yeah, I don't understand that. - Gloria. Serious. - I'm walking away from you. I'm serious. I met this guy at the museum, and he's so fuckin' hot. And he knows so much stuff about birds. Well, he sounds like a winner, and you should marry him. I should. [Gloria] Yep. I'll be your maid of honor. Oh, my God, his stare is so intense, and I just want his hands all over my body. And he's kind of old, but he's really mysterious. And he wears this thing around his neck. Don't tell me it's this fucking gross pendant shit. - Yeah. - Like this gaudy fucking bling. - How did you know that? - Because he's gross. And I've seen him, and you need to stop. I think he's so hot. Eww! - I've heard things like... - Like what? He's a Satanist. Please tell me you know his name. Please make my day. OK, wait for it. It's... - [sighs] - [softly] What's his name? Vincent. I believe. - Really? - Yeah, like Vincent fucking Price. Yeah, it's Vincent. Vincent. [low chattering] Thank you. Let's go. - Whoops. - [woman] Bitch! [giggling] [Gloria] You're always scribbling away. Is it about me? I wanna read it. I don't know, sometimes. Stop, it's not for you. It's just observations. It's just scribbling. I can't even tell if it's good or not. Well, if you keep talking like that, you'll never get anywhere. There's a difference between being humble and just being stupid. You can be my agent. I'll be the tits. You be the brain. Mm. [Gloria] I'm working tonight. Are you? [Jade] No. [Gloria] I always think about my mother, when she got ready for her dates. It was always like this, uh... shimmery, glittery makeup covering the pink bathroom, and... curling iron would be on. It's a different guy every night. She would, um... She would always leave me this TV dinner. It had a... you know, the kind with the mashed potatoes and then that like... burnt brownie. And then, uh, eventually she'd... leave me money. One day she just left. Hey, I don't really know what's going on. I don't think Phil cares if I come in anymore. - [Gloria] Yeah? - Yeah. [Gloria] Well, I'm sure daddy will cut you a little stipend just to keep your clothes on, huh? Or at least to keep your mouth shut about where he goes at night. [Jade] I seriously don't get it. I don't get why guys go in there to get blue balls together. I swear, I was giving a dance to this guy the other night, and he looks at me and says, "I'm gonna think of you while I'm fucking my wife tonight." Is that it for some of them? Or they just come in their pants. It's mostly prostitution if you want to make good money, anyhow. VIP room. Pow. [Jade] I wanna find this Vincent guy. Why? He's a fucking creep. [Jade] He's no creepier than anyone I've ever gyrated on. How do I go about doing that? [Gloria] Duh. Send him some nude pics. [Jade] Wouldn't know where to send it. [Gloria] Oh, God, Jade, use your fucking head. Follow the dude. Plus, it'll be fun. And you'll get to see where he hides all the bodies. You could stand to get laid, anyhow. Church.

What can I do for you? [indistinct conversations] [muffled music pounding] Gloria! Crisis. Gloria, I'm freaking out because I left a package at Vincent's house the other night and I left all of my contact information and I haven't heard from him yet. [Gloria] Well, he's probably not interested. Or maybe he's a fag. Jesus, thanks for your honesty. [sighs] OK, I'll just chill out. What on earth are you doing volunteering in a barn? First World guilt. What do the horses think of your hairstyle? What do you say to them? "I'm not sick, just alternative"? It's funny, they're actually horses, so they don't pass judgment, or even speak. It's Gewurztraminer. It's way too sweet. I bet you just like saying that big word. [mocking] "Gewurztraminer-er." [chuckles] Uh... It's offensively saccharine. [father] I'm glad your yearbook finally came, Dez. - [mother] Hey. - [father] Ha ha. [father] That was a lovely girl you took to prom. [mother] Although you could have taken whomever you wanted. We would never judge. And your school seems to be pretty progressive. Although all teenagers are bisexual anyway. - [Desmond] Good to know. - [Jade sniggers] [father] You've never experienced these milestones. These kids are all matriculating at four-year universities now, like your brother will be doing next semester. Whatever, enablers. [father] Some people like to cause trouble on purpose, for attention. You've had a very easy life. You know I do plan on going to school, just ask Desmond. - For something useful? - [Jade] That's debatable. How useful is your prestigious associate's degree? Hey! Don't talk to your mother like that. Says the little girl who wanted to be a unicorn when she grew up. You've succeeded there all on your own. Hey, I know that you want Victorian children who, like, never speak unless spoken to, but I have a voice, OK? [mocking] Yeah, Dad. She has a voice. - Shut up, Desmond. You're such a jerk! - Hey. - [Desmond sniggers] - Look... I know I'm taking a little bit of time, but everybody just has to be patient, and everything will be OK. Have you eaten anything, Jade? The chicken is delicious. I ate the heart. At least she ate something. [soft jazz music plays] [mailbox opens] [clock clatters, chimes] [chuckles] [mouths] [door clatters] [door closes] [keyboard clacks] [music fades] [paper rustles] [Vincent] Hello. [Jade] Ooh! [clears throat] Hello. What are you doing here? [Vincent] I'm hungry. [Jade snickers] Yeah, right. [Vincent] So, what you're saying is you can break into my house, but I can't visit you in a public place. No. It's just a fortnight later, and I figured you were not interested. [Vincent] "A fortnight," she says. That solidifies the intrigue. I'm pleased to see you also share your silver lining and not just your naked pictures. Doesn't your boyfriend mind? I don't have a boyfriend. A handsome girl like you. Handsome? [horse harness jingles] I brought this for you. What? It's... amazing. Wow. [chuckles] [Vincent] You have to write as much as you can. You'll find your voice that way. - You read my stuff. - Of course. Well, shit. Do you have to swear? No. God, I'm working on it. I'll try not to cuss. Ah, even "cuss" sounds like a curse word. Good job, Jade. [Vincent] It's a weakness. There's plenty of sufficient words just waiting to be papered to our doings. [Jade] Thank you. You're welcome. You look lovely in red. [laughs] Oh, my God. [sighs] [Jade] I take it you need a ride. I do. Don't smoke. Even I'm going through something. Rebellious. What was that? Father, Son, Holy Spirit? I was raised devout Catholic. Really? Yeah. But I'm done with Christianity. Now what I want to do is sacrifice children. Pardon me? [chuckles] What the...? [chuckles] isn't that what you've expected all this time? Hey, that's just small-town folk and their fear of the unknown. That's just word on the street. Well... as a culture, we worship the sensational. Anything that garners attention, even if negative, is worth worshipping. Fortunately, the people that are brave enough to make a statement either don't know what to do with their control or with their charisma... [speaks indistinctly] Yeah. Or you could just say that people with strong personalities either get famous or diagnosed. Or you could say that. Let's get the fuck out of here, it's freezing. Yes. You swear a lot. I'm working on it! Oh! [Vincent] Do you know that the white pelican is the national bird of Romania? Oh, really? "A wonderful bird is the pelican, his beak can hold more than his belly can. He can hold in his beak [softly] enough food for a week, but I'll be darned if I know how the hell he can." Bravo. My grandmother used to say that to me. That is beautiful. There is a legend that in times of famine, a mother pelican will wound herself with her beak to feed her own flesh and blood to her young. Wow. What must it be like to care for somebody that much? To want them to thrive so badly that you would sacrifice yourself? That is the reason why the pelican became a Christ metaphor. I once lived in a Hispanic neighborhood in the city, and I remember on Good Friday seeing for the first time a bunch of them led by a priest dressed in red, carrying a cross. They prayed, they sang, they chanted. Sure, you could say it was overly dramatic or sheep-like... but in that moment as they passed, the city street was quiet... and all I could do was be in the moment with them. Wow. "Congregation" in Latin means a flock of animals. Sometimes you have to be in awe of devotion. [engine stops] Aren't you gonna invite me in? Since when do you need an invitation? I don't bite. You don't really know me. I wanna know you. [Vincent] Aren't you afraid? [Jade] I'm not afraid. [Vincent] Neither was Joan of Arc. [Jade] It's much different than your earlier work. [Vincent] You've done your research. I am much different now. They're magnificent. They remind me a lot of Beatrix Potter. I love the idea that animals have these little civilized lives in trees and in holes in the ground, and... What makes you think they don't? [Jade chuckles] Mark Twain said, "Of all the animals, man is the only one that is cruel. He is the only one that can inflict pain for the pleasure of doing it." - [Jade] Hmm. - [Vincent] Please. So... Bucharest, Paris, New York. And now here. [laughs] You were a crow before you were a raven. [Vincent] You might say. Got any booze, Vincent? I don't drink. I think it's an unnecessary vice. Can I still drink? I don't think you should drink here, no. Oh, wait. You think I'm gonna get wasted, seduce you, and then wake up crying, "Humbert! Humbert!"? Vincent... I'm in my 20s now. OK? Jade. - What? - Don't. [Jade] Oh, my God. - [Vincent] No, it's fine. - Oh, my God. I am so fucking embarrassed. - Don't swear. - Oh my God. I'm sorry, I just thought, after all of this... - "After all this," meaning? - ...we would have sex. You seem to be going about attention-seeking in a lascivious way. No, I don't. Then what just happened? What just happened was I was... trying to connect with you. [sighs] Your way of expressing is going to get you hurt. You need to protect yourself. You have to be more careful. I... I can't be physical with you that way. [exhales] Vincent, look... I know that you're sick, OK? So what? You're still... a man. Jade. Look, Vincent, it's really embarrassing to be turned down by a guy who's nearly thrice my age. You'd think it would be a wet dream, but... I guess not. The biggest complications in one's life are often self-imposed. No one's turning you down. I get it. You don't want to be the next dude on the list of guys that Jade has slept with to feel better about herself. [sighs] I want to be the dude that makes you set that list on fire. I wouldn't mind getting to know you, either. Thank you. And good night. [Vincent] Good night. [rhythmic banging in distance] [mother moaning] Oh, my God. - What? - Oh, my God. What, you seriously never heard them banging? - No. This happens regularly? - They literally... They literally fuck all the time. Oh, my God. How do you get any work done? [Desmond] Headphones. [banging continues] Are you talking to a girl? You are totally talking to a girl. - Fuck off. - Desmond. - I knew it. - Knew what? You're not gay. - Yeah. No shit I'm not gay. - What? So why did...? It's easier to mislead Mom and Dad. [banging continues] I also think Mom really wants a gay son. Desmond. That's pretty brilliant. I wish I were so clever. Yeah, if you were clever, you wouldn't live in this stupid little mountain town subjecting yourself to all this shit. Thanks. Look, I'm sorry. They're just really getting to me right now. Should probably be easier on Mom. There's probably nothing more dark and alienating than motherhood. - Church. - [boards thumping] Hey, you'll miss me when I go, though. And you'll be out of here really soon. Plus, you can't always hate where you came from, you know. - Like, this place shaped you. - [thumping continues] And on that, little brother, I'll see you later. Good night. - And good night, Julia. - Fuck you. [Jade gasps] You know, it is customary to knock first. Why aren't you eating? The vegetables are fresh, and I killed the venison last week. [Jade sighs] Um... I'm sick, too. Just in a different way. Uh, plus Gloria's on my case to lose all this weight - that we had to gain. - Had to gain? [softly] Yeah. [Vincent] If someone likes controlling their own life, they seek to control other facets, other people. This is her problem and you are her victim, but you are allowing it. [Jade] We have a complex relationship. The temptation is there to phase her out, it's just... I feel like we need each other. [Vincent] Why? 'Cause we're all that each other has. Well, the gentlemen's club makes a little more sense now. You can both exercise your need for control through... male manipulation and body profiteering. - I don't understand. - What is there to understand? I don't understand why you feel you are unlovable. Don't feel guilt. It's good to be emotional. I brought dessert. You really are bent on corrupting me. [Vincent inhales] [coughs] I never liked smoking in front of people. Why? Made me paranoid. I like smoking with you. Was that tree here before? [Jade chuckles] I haven't done this since yesterday with my brother, Desmond. You have a brother? You're not an only child? No. You have the classic bored- and-ignored demeanor of one. [Jade laughs] How dare you! Very easily, I just did. I'm actually really close to Desmond. And we smoke tons of weed together. Jerk. [Vincent laughs] Oh! God, I must be so late. [Vincent sighs] [Vincent] It's OK. I'll take care of it. Hey, are you OK? You're tremoring. I'm fine. "Tremoring" isn't a word. What can I do for you? Come back soon. Good night. [door closes] [Jade] And he draws the most amazing pictures and then at the end of the night, he said he wants to get to know me. - You lie! - No, I swear to God. It's going really well. I mean, it's not sexual or anything. I think that's an act because there's definitely tension, but... You know, as much as I like intercourse, - what we have is strangely more special. - [gagging] - How sweet. - [Jade] Fuck you. [muffled conversations] [thunder crashes] [Jade, laughing] Oh, my God. [rain pattering] [Vincent] I can't believe you made me do this. I have been wanting to steal this fucking thing... - [Vincent] Can you please not swear? - ...for so long. [catching breath] Oh, my God! Ahh. [sighs] [thunder rumbling] [Jade exhales sharply] [sighs] Tonight's a waxing gibbous. [Vincent] I have to say, you are a quick learner when you want to be. Mm-hmm. Ooh, thank you. [chuckles] You look like a mermaid. - Oh, God. - What? - That was a compliment. - [chuckles] No, I know. Gloria used to call the guys that I would get with "mermaid fuckers." - Mermaid fuckers? - You said the "f" word. I guess I did, just out of curiosity. Mermaid fuckers are guys with whom I've had a few trysts, and then they try to break it off because they tell me I'm this intangible creature and that it can never be, and they try to be flattering about it. It's all bullshit. And I know you think I'm lecherous, but before you begin about that, just... You said it, I didn't. That's true. [distant thunder rumbles] [softly humming tune] How do you know that song? That's a tune my grandma used to sing me. It's an old song from the '20s or something. [Vincent] I know what it is. "My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon." My sister used to sing that song to me. [Jade] Oh. I'm sorry. [distant thunder rumbling] [Vincent] It's all right. She was older and she... She became more of a mother to me after our parents died. [Jade] Your parents died? I'm so sorry. I was in a very dark place for a long time. I felt like... as though... that part of me now is taken away and I could not get it back. Do you have other relatives? Uh, no, not here. No one that matters. Well, who are your friends? I really want to meet them. Someday. I don't know... [Jade] Voilà! Well... look who's not only eating now but cooking. [Jade] I know. Isn't it horrifying? [thunder rumbles] I knew you'd be back, slut. How have you been? Why are you really here, babe? Just to rub in how happy you are with Hail Satan? [Jade sighs] I'm really glad you found your knight in wrinkly armor. God, it's fucking disgusting how love and happiness just ruin people, you know? They just wanna infect everybody else. Oh, come on. You overestimate me, Gloria. [Gloria] Oh, God, shut up! Your life is so goddamn easy. You know, I entered treatment because I have a fucking problem. You ended up there for being a teenage fucking girl. I work at the club to pay my bills. You think people aren't on to you? A visitor with a pen behind her ear slumming it? I took you under my wing. I was there for you. You just... abandoned me. [sniffles] Whatever. I don't need you. [footsteps approaching] Can I watch a movie? I don't know, can you? [Jade] May I watch a movie? [Vincent] You know I don't have television. [Jade] You don't even have movies? Movies are OK. Don't you like to laugh? [Vincent] Yes, I like to laugh sometimes. You make me laugh. Books and poems make me laugh. I chuckled to Alexander Pope the other night. - [Jade] Maybe I should read some, then. - Maybe you should. He said, "Amusement is the happiness of those who cannot think." What's this? What is what? Jade? What is what? [door rattles] Vincent, what is this? Can we just go back upstairs? [Jade] What is it? I don't want to talk about it. - I wanna go back upstairs. - What is it, Vincent? Vincent, what is it? Do not ask a question to... To which you do not want to know the answer. What is it?! It's to take one's own life and be sure of it. [Jade] Oh, my God. I built it years ago. [Jade] You're a selfish asshole. You are a selfish fucking asshole. [departing footsteps] [Vincent] Will you allow me to explain?! We have discussed control. I can't go through any more darkness. Get away from me. That is so weak and so contrived. That is exactly the kind of thing you would talk down about, you hypocrite! - We have a good thing going! - Jade, stop. This is fucked, and don't tell me not to curse, goddamn it. Take your own advice. [mocking] "Oh, be present." Be a bad ass. Live, love, risk, fuck it. I'm trying to express something to you, but you're refusing to understand. You don't know me that well. I do know you. And it scares you. - [thunder rumbling] - [rain pattering] [Vincent] What would your parents think of all this? Who cares? They're nuts. If anything, they'd just be happy that I cared for somebody else and I'm not a sociopath. [distant thunder rumbles] This could seem strange. [Jade] Strange? I know where you're going with this. [sighs] You think that you're robbing me of my youth, that one day I'm going to wake up and regret all of this, that people change, that people will judge us. Anything else? No, that sums it up. Thanks for letting me stay. You can stay as long as you want. [Jade] So can you. [light rain falling] [distant thunder rumbles] [metallic banging] [banging continues] [Vincent straining] [sighs] [scratching on easel] [Jade] Good morning. [Vincent] There's breakfast at the table. [scratching continues] Use as much honey as you'd like. It's fresh. [scratching] [Jade] Actually, honey never goes bad. You can open a jar after a thousand years, and it'll still be fresh. Are you going to have breakfast with me? [Vincent] I'm not hungry. Well, are you gonna at least sit with me and have some tea?

Journals aren't for anyone else's reading. If you must know, I was just writing about how well you're doing. How proud I am of you. Read for yourself. That's all right. What is wrong with you? - Spit it out, darling. - Just stop. I'm done. I'm just done. It's a boy, isn't it? Whoever he is, I can tell you right now... Mom, please don't start with all the maternal stuff about how he didn't deserve me and... I appreciate it, I do, it's just... this was different. You know, when you were a little girl, you used to throw the worst temper tantrums. - Really? - Yeah. In the mall. [chuckles] Anywhere, you would rip off your clothes. - You'd cry and scream. - I don't remember that. I remember having a tantrum at Magic Kingdom, though, because the castle is just this wooden facade. I understand that disappointment. For me, it's when you find the perfect dress in a catalog and you think to yourself, "Ah, I too can be young and thin and drinking wine in the south of France." And then you open the box and it's just a sad piece of fabric folded into a plastic bag. [Jade] Wow, that sounds tragic. - It is to me. - [both chuckle] [piano music plays] [music fades] [Vincent] How have you been? Been better. But, you know, living life. Did you miss me? [Vincent sighs] More than you know. How about you? Like, I don't... I'm sorry to bust in like this. Um... I just don't know what's going on. [emotionally] You have given me some exciting feeling. [inhales sharply] I have considered things in a new way for the first time in ages. But I've given you all I can. Why do you have to...? Because I love you! I want you to grow, to move on. This is what I want for you. Maybe you don't realize, we were too comfortable. I'm not comfortable. [Vincent sniffles] I can't see you anymore, but I want you to go. Can you please go? Can you please go? [Vincent sniffles] [sobbing] Can you please go? [Jade] I'm not going anywhere. I'm in. [Vincent breathing unsteadily] Like I know what you want. Just let me be part of it, OK? Do you understand what that means? You do? [Jade] Hey, kid, hop in. I got some candy for you. Desmond, just get in the car. Fuck you. [chuckles] Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? Nothing. Well, you're hanging out with me. [Desmond] Fuck, Jade. I know, Gloria's soul is dog shit. And here I am in love with a dying man. I mean, he's made his mind up. I guess nihilism is better than apathy. I mean, anything's better than apathy. Don't become that pathetic, Desmond. Not trying to do that. I don't know shit from shit, but... maybe it's a good thing you and Vincent never really got to be. You know, you never really got a chance to resent each other. Vincent is the first person that I ever wanted to get close to. It is what it is. Being in love's ugly, Jade. In love there's farts and hate. [chuckles] - I'm glad we're doing this. - Me too, it's been ages. To my beautiful children, who I get all to myself while Ted is away. - [Desmond] All right? - [Jade] Fit as a fiddle. [mother] Jade, honey, you need a manicure. Those chipped nails are disgusting. Great, Mom. I'll just leave the table right now and go get one. I love you anyway, chipped nails and all. Just... try to be sensible. [Desmond] Words to live by. Sylvia Booth, everybody. Oh, Dez, look. What about him? He's cute. I'm sure cutting my dick off would be nice, too. Mom, can you stop trying to set Desmond up with a guy? - Get a life. - OK, maybe I should find somebody for you since you've been sleeping around long enough. - [chuckles] - [Desmond] You really have. [Susan] Sylvia! Well, hi! Hello! - Hello, Susan, how are you? - How are you? I'm well, thank you. How are you? I missed seeing you the other evening at the benefit. Were you ill? No, I'm just sick and tired of those things. Oh. Well, we missed you. And how are my Desmond and... Jade? - How are you both? - [Desmond] I'm wait-listed at Brown, and apparently I'm gay. And I'm a dropout that's dabbled in porn, so... Susan, my kids are fucking awesome. I couldn't be prouder of both of them. [Susan] Aha. Well... I'll just let you finish your little dinner, and I'll be on my way. Nice to see you, as always. - Ta-ta. - [Susan] Bye-bye. [Jade] Well done, Mom. Meant every word, my darlings. [chuckles] [Vincent] Where are we going? [Jade] We're going to teach someone a lesson about exploiting people. You ready? Rock-and-roll. [Jade] Fuck you and your clubs! [straining] OK, we gotta get the fuck out of here! - Ready? Wanna drive? - No. - Come on, drive. - Yeah? Let's do it! Whooo! [piano music playing] [music fades] [laughs] Stuff like this made him seem like a... average human being. When he wasn't. [Desmond] No one's exempt from being human. "Tis true, tis certain, man, though dead, retains part of himself. The immortal mind remains." He loved Pope. Jesus, nothing is a mistake with this guy. [chuckles] [rock music plays] [Jade laughs] Floor it! I'm just gonna mess it up.
