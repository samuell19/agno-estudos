But you gotta believe. We need to ask for help. We gotta believe it's coming. I don't know how, what shape, what size, where, but we gotta believe. When we believe, we will receive. If we don't believe, we're already dead. Join with me, people. (ROARS) (BEAST ROARING) (TAT GIRL GRUNTING) TAT GIRL: Fuck. SECRETS: Join with me. SLASHER: Shut up. SECRETS: Join with me. I'm sick and tired of that shit. Stop it. Just fucking stop it. Stop it! Secrets, we're being fucking exterminated. No amount of hoping, begging or praying is gonna fucking fix it. No fucking bullshit book of the month is gonna save us. We're on the fucking chopping block here. It's fucking Armageddon outside. So wake the fuck up, you little floozy. And all we got is jack and shit. (SECRETS HUMMING) We're what's left of what's left behind. And nobody's fucking coming to save us. (SINGING) Oh, fuck. Shit, what the fuck is that? Israel.

What the fuck? TAT GIRL: Fuck off. SHITKICKER: Hold it right there. Who are you people? We're just people trying to save our asses, hotshot. Okay? BIKER QUEEN: Been waiting all night for the cavalry. - You it? - No. They're all dead. BARTENDER: Ain't nobody else coming here? SHITKICKER: I've been driving all night. There's no Army, no militia, no soldiers and only bits and pieces of Boy Scouts left. Ain't no one of substance coming. (GREG GRUNTS) What the heck happened to him? He was fucking stupid, that's what happened. There are weapons here. This ain't a place to stay. I'm mounting an offensive. Who's game? Look out! Remember me, motherfucker, huh? (GRUNTING) (FARTING) SLASHER: Oh, shit. Y’all literally kicked the shit out of him. He's a piece of shit. He's been holed up in here, wouldn’t let anyone in. Just watched them die. You didn't say the magic word. BIKER QUEEN: Where's your nephew, huh? I haven't seen him since the invasion. He is out there, where the fuck is he? - Where is he? - I ain't seen him. - I ain't seen him. I swear. - Asshole! I swear, I ain't seen him. I swear. (GROANING) What's all this offensive shit, partner? I'm taking the fight to them. I heard all that shit in the war and I gotta tell you, cowboy, it never turned out well. I'm talking about a good old-fashioned street fight, old-timer. They'll keep coming till we figure out how to stomp them down. (YELLING) Hell, we're not safe out here. Let's get back to the cell. Come on. How are you gonna do that? Stomp them out. Well, with sweat, firepower and-- And a little something called courage. You people wanna wait here and die? Or you wanna take the fight to these devil dogs? Yeah. Yeah, we should fight, shouldn’t we? SHITKICKER: As soon as we find the keys for that gun cabinet, grab some guns, throw your chambers in your pockets. We'll have enough "fuck you" in this place to really hurt some feelings. I knew you'd come. I knew you'd save us. Well, I'll do my best. BARTENDER: How are we gonna fight? I mean, your fucking truck, man, it's a piece of shit. Gotta be some other vehicles nearby. Keys? - They're in the safe. SLASHER: Shut up. GREG: I know the combination. - Fuck you, Greg. You take my wife, now you want my cars? This is my livelihood. It's for the greater good, so... - Listen to the man. - Oh, yeah. - I do not like him. SECRETS: Shut up, buddy. He's the one. You believe. GREG: Greg, roughly around the time you fed a baby to those things out there, the magic between us disappeared, okay? We're taking a break. How does that feel? SHITKICKER: We break into four groups of two. If we're separated, they can't bunch up. Our chances for survival increase dramatically. You two, Rent-a-Wreck and Jor-El, we're alpha team. We're drawing them out. We form a triangle, guard each other's backs and protect the women. And once we've breached that front door, follow us out. Stay in your groups, head for that car lot. You. You must make it. Get those keys fast. Those things will be coming. HOBO: What about me? - You're staying, shitpants. SHITKICKER: I'll have no more of that. Nobody's left behind, everybody's coming. SLASHER: Fuck that. He's half brain-dead. SHITKICKER: It doesn't matter, you hear? The rest of you hear me? No one is left behind. Now, share the credo. You ever used one of these before? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Let me show you. Now, you take Mr. Bullet here and you load him right-- Right into the chamber there. And you cock the trigger, all right? Take your time when you aim. All right, now. You gently squeeze the trigger. Hammer hits the pin, there's an explosion, and Mr. Bullet travels down the barrel. He pops out. And if your aim is true... Whew... You gonna be able to handle that, little lady? Oh, I can handle it. All right. I like what I see. (GASPING) What the fuck? It was just an accident. It just went off. It just went off. Way to go. (CLANGING) (BEASTS GROWLING) BIKER QUEEN: Oh, shit. Go in the cell. Go in the cell. Get in the cell. SLASHER: This way, killer. BIKER QUEEN: Oh, Jesus. TAT GIRL: Come on. So, what the fuck do we do now? - We gotta get the guns. - We don't have a key. Nobody asked me. SLASHER: So who's going, then, huh? Because I sure as shit ain't going. Fuck that. - All right, go. Go. - This is really some fucked-up shit. This is fucked up. You know this is fucked up. This is the part where the brother usually dies. Listen. If you hear anything, pull me back. Fuck. I can't stand that bitch. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. This is really fucked up. (BEAST GROWLS) - Oh, shit. - Did you hear something? (DOOR CLOSES) What was that? (BEASTS GROWLING) - Wait, wait.

Get this shit off me. Get me out of this fucking thing. Get me out of this shit. We gotta get out of this town. - Hurry. Come on, come on. BIKER QUEEN: Go. Go. - Go. - Ladies first. Go ahead. I-- I know what you're up to. - I know what you're up to. - Shut up. I can use a shield. BIKER QUEEN: Hey. Where the hell are you going, motherfucker? (GROANING) Come on, little guy. LIGHTNING (IN SPANISH) : Last stop, shitbag. (SCREAMING) HOBO: Don't taste so good. (BELCHING) (CACKLING) - Double-crossing sleazebag. - Listen. No, no, no. You don't understand. I wasn't trying to screw you. - Shut up. They'll hear you. SLASHER: Jesus. WOMAN: God. - Jesus. All right, listen. Listen, I-- I-- Listen, would you stop fucking hitting me? I'm not fucking with you. I didn't know how to tell you this. I do not have enough cars. Be quiet! Shh! I don't have enough cars for everyone, okay? But if we stay-- Be quiet! Shut up. Listen. Listen. No, no, no. We can do this, okay? All we gotta do is stick together, okay? Fuck your boss. I can't stand that bitch. But you, you and me, if we stick together, if we stick together... SLASHER: Somebody! Oh, no. Somebody. Help! Please, help me. (GRUNTING) (YELLS) (WAILING) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. BARTENDER: Hurry up and open the safe, pipehead, and let's get the fuck out of here. GREG: Oh, God.

You must go underground through the sewers. The way to the big city. You want us to take these storm drains all the way back to the big city? - Don't talk to the Prophet that way. - Bitch, I will fuck you up. BARTENDER: Hey, hey, hey, dipshit. Listen, this guy just saved our asses, okay? If he says take the storm drain, we better sure as shit take the storm drain. Be cool. Let's play this thing out. PROPHET: Come, we must act quickly.
