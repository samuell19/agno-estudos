The seeds were planted over a century ago in nearby Washington, D.C., where African-Americans first learned, then transformed the art of basketball. ♪♪♪ [McAdams] This area was the first to master the game of basketball, thanks to Dr. Edwin Bancroft Henderson, the first black physical educator in the nation. [narrator] Edwin B. Henderson hoped basketball would boost college access and social mobility for black youth. The so-called Father of Black Basketball had learned the sport from its creator, James Naismith, while attending a Harvard University sports and recreation program in 1904. [McAdams] Henderson brought the game back to D.C., went to the black Y, which is known as the historic 12th Street Y, and that was the venue of basketball in Washington, D.C., as it pertains to African-Americans. ♪♪♪ [Pennington] He thought if we had an athletic skill, we could utilize that to get into good white schools in America. A lot of racism goes out the window when you're competing with your white counterpart to win games. [McAdams] D.C. had a leg up because of Dr. Henderson. The fundamentals and the proper way to play the game were taught to the youngsters in Washington, D.C. [narrator] Henderson's players won championships. Some even changed the world, like Charles Drew, who later created the world's first blood bank as a trailblazing physician, and Edward Duke Ellington, the composer who'd go on to redefine American music. Though legal segregation prevailed in the nation's capital, D.C.'s black community built a thriving city within a city, anchored by institutions like Howard University and the U Street business corridor.

[narrator] From D.C., they brought skill and deep knowledge of the game. They also found an ideal environment for hoops, a county with one of the nation's best park systems. Prince George's County has over 400 parks, and in most of those parks, you have basketball courts, and you can get out there and play, and you can raise that level of play based upon the competition that you receive within those communities. [Kevin] Every summer, just about every day, you know, we was playing outdoors on that blacktop. As soon as I woke up, I was going downstairs and going to the court across the street from my apartment building. We got that competition early on. It was very competitive. For me, it was a young kid walking on the court with a bunch of grown men. And you had to go in there and prove to the older adults that we belong on this court. [overlapping chatter] You could virtually ride in--in the neighborhoods, and any basketball court in many neighborhoods would be packed. [Steve] I love basketball so much. It was like an amusement park, 'cause you could learn something every single day from somebody. [Adrian] First of all, you'd better get into court early. If you're not there at 9:00, you might not play until 11:00, and if you lost a game, you might as well go home. If we were playing and it got too dark, there were no lights. Guys that drove would turn their headlights on so we could finish a game. [people talking indistinctly] And so if you lose, and you-- and you're not good, you know, they might say you're not playing no more. [Walt] So that sense of urgency, you know, was always there.

[all cheering] [chatter, ball bouncing] [narrator] In 1956, DeMatha Catholic High School hired a young history teacher as its basketball coach. Under Morgan Wootten, DeMatha would create a powerful and enduring PG County institution. We have here Morgan Wootten, the coach of DeMatha High School. Greatest coach probably in the history of high school basketball. [McAdams] Morgan comes to DeMatha, and he decided, "I'm gonna play the best players I can get ahold of.

[Adrian] When I was in middle school, I said to myself, "Hey, I want to go to DeMatha. I wanna play for Coach Wooten." [narrator] DeMatha made a big leap from regional power to elite national program back in 1965 when it faced Power Memorial, a New York team considered invincible. I don't think that I am engaging in hyperbole when I talk about the significance to PG County when DeMatha High School hosted the biggest high school basketball game at that time against Power Memorial High School from New York City, that had a 7'1" ball player on their team then known by the name of Lew Alcindor, also known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Power Memorial High School was on a 71-game win streak. They were phenomenal. We'd won about 30-some in a row. Our last loss had been to Power the year before, when Kareem was a junior.

You know, it impacted my life a lot because my dad gave me the game of basketball, and, you know, I went-- I went through a stage in life where, you know, I really needed a lot of attention. [narrator] The void was partially filled when Malone started coaching Smith with D.C. Assault. The bond grew tighter when Malone married Smith's mother, Monica, in 2005. [Nolan] He took care of everybody, and if he could get somebody off the streets and into a gym, if they were in a messed-up home, he'd bring them into his home. If someone reached out to Curtis like, "Hey, I know a kid, 6'9", lefty, growing up in Belhaven. He--he needs you," Curtis being the guy that he was, like, "Yo, I'ma give him a chance." And at the time, Beas was on house arrest. [laughs] Curtis talked to his mom. She agreed, so then from there, that's when we became brothers. [Beasley] When I got to D.C. Assault was... ...yeah, that's when I was born. [Lou] Michael Beasley was just a--a terror. He was pretty much unstoppable, and then his partner in crime, Nolan Smith-- he could dunk it on you. He could make spectacular passes. He'd make a one-handed pass like a Magic Johnson-type pass. [Beasley] Me and Nolan got closest I've ever been to anybody in my life. We just started working out, doing push-ups in the room, and just play one-on-one and fight. The games would never end. Make sure you get that. You make sure you get that. We would end up fighting and then walking home mad at each other, and that right there pretty much was our relationship. You know, he was number one in the area. I was number two. I wanted to be number one. And I never--I never had a brother, so he became that for me.

You know, when I lost my father, you know, I started to hang around the wrong crowds. I went through a little rough stage in my life. [Nolan] And we went and sat in the gym, and I said, "Look, man. I-I know what you're going through. I got you. Let's use the gym." We shot and we talked for hours, and that's when the gym became his sanctuary. ♪ Yeah... ♪ [Quinn] I was the little brother, and you know, I was cool because I had relationships with those guys, and Curt made sure of that, and obviously, when my dad passed, Curt--you know, I basically lived with them for that next year. [narrator] More than just a beloved father figure, Malone became the godfather of D.C. basketball. By controlling much of the local talent pipeline, he transformed D.C. Assault into a lucrative enterprise, including an Adidas deal for $50,000 a year. [Nolan] He had all the juice. Curtis had the juice to get us, you know, on the stage and be seen and basically get us to where we ultimately got to, which was the NBA and to Duke and Kansas State, and Curtis really got us out to Vegas and started getting us to all these big-time tournaments. You know, that-- that really changed the game for us. [Curtis] What I did was realize how the shoe companies were all looking for their next Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. You know, maybe this is a business that I could turn, um, you know, D.C. Assault into. He was a marketing genius. I gotta give it to him. [Nolan] This game of basketball's a business, and at that moment, we didn't know it, 'cause we were so young. You know, it's very unfortunate, uh, the way things transpired with, uh, D.C. Assault and their, uh--their leader, uh, Curtis Malone. My first reaction when I got the call-- uh, it was from my sister. She's like, "They got Curt." "What you mean, they got Curt?" "They got him. They got him." I'm like... "For what?" [laughs] Federal agents arrested Curtis Malone as a key suspect in a major drug operation. [reporter] The DEA alleges he was also distributing heroin and cocaine. On Friday, agents searched his Upper Marlboro home... You know, it was one of them days where it was like, not Curt. Like, couldn't believe it. But you don't really know why. You're wondering why. [Quinn] I lived with Curt for a year, and I had no idea what was going on, 'cause all I saw was the positive things that he was doing, the kids that he took off the street, the--the gifts and the presents and the bills that he paid. I wish that hadn't happened, but it did, But does that tarnish the type of person that he was and what he did, how many people he touched? No, because he looked out for the people first. It hurt, and people were surprised. A lot of people didn't judge him. [Navarro] I-I ain't really judge him awful. You know what I'm saying? Because I always saw the good in what he was doing, and none of that ever came around the kids. [Colder] He cared about the millions of dollars that he could make from drug trafficking. He... didn't serve as a role model. It was a false model. Y'all can say whatever the fuck y'all want about him. Y'all can talk dirt. He always the had the kids first, man. He always--he always put the kids first. He always fed the kids before he ate. [phone system] ...A prepaid call. This call is from... [Curtis] Curtis Malone. [phone system] An inmate at...a federal prison. [Curtis] I try to capitalize on the mistakes that I have made which, um--it caused me so much embarrassment, man, because I'm preaching to these kids not to do one thing, but I'm doing another, and it was just, you know-- it was my ego, my pride, um, my greed. ♪ somber music ♪ [Nolan] I know who he really is: the person that would give his shirt off his back to a kid, that would do anything to get these kids scholarships, but then that other side, the evil side that did what...he felt like he might have had to do? I can't quite put my hands around that side, 'cause I don't think that's who he is. [narrator] Malone's felony conviction stunned the community and attracted national press, but the sustainability of PG County hoops never belonged to one individual. The county's ecosystem remained strong. ♪ MF Doom's "One Beer" playing ♪ ♪ There's only one beer left, Rappers screaming... ♪ [Quinn] The thing that makes PG County so unique is that the guy that you want to be like is bringing you up. The D-I players and NBA players-- they bring you up, 'cause they know what they had to go through to make it, and we all want to see each other win, so that's why we're all extremely close. ♪♪♪ [announcer] It's just a great story with Oladipo and Quinn Cook and then the mentorship of the older of the Maryland guys and Kevin Durant. ♪ synth music ♪ KD has always been a big brother to me, somebody, um, that I've always, you know, reached out to for anything, and he's reached out to me, just making sure I was okay. He's always been there for me. [man] Takes a long time to get really good at playing basketball, and a lot of those guys grind it out for a while. Quinn Cook, the same way. Every kid dreams of getting drafted. Like, I knew I was gonna wear... I knew what I was gonna do as soon as I heard my name called. The Charlotte Hornets select... The Miami Heats select... Indiana Pacers select... [Quinn] But it never happened. ♪ dramatic music ♪ I felt sorry for myself for about two minutes. When he didn't get drafted, you know, everybody knew he was gonna be all right, because that's the type of player he is. [Thomas] It's the cliché term of "you can do anything you put your mind to," but Quinn is the perfect definition of it. ♪ gentle music ♪ He had plenty of people in his ear telling him his best route was going overseas, trying to get money, but Quinn had a dream. [announcer] Back to Cook. Left wing, three. Ball! He tied the ball game! [Thomas] He earned his stripes in the D league. He did what it took. So with that story, it's just an amazing accomplishment and a blessing. [announcer] On the floor, Cook. Oh! [announcer] That is not an easy shot. - [announcer] He knows it. - [announcer] Yeah. [Kevin] He's never stopped working, man. That's what I tell people. Look at Quinn. [announcer] Three by Quinn! You know, 'cause he called me when he didn't get drafted. It was his--he was crying 'cause he didn't get drafted. And I'm like, "Bro, you got talent. Just keep working. Never stop." ♪♪♪ 'Sup, y'all? This Quinn Cook, Started in the G League, ended up NBA champion. Always believe in yourself. Don't let anybody tell you you can't do whatever you want to do. You know, definitely, I'm just proud, uh, coming from where we come from. Uh, you look at the odds... It's under one percent of a person in here that's gonna make it to the NBA, and I told myself--I said, "I'ma be the one percent, then." You know, I had guys to look up to who made it, so we put our goals to action, our plans to action, and we got it done. And I don't believe in those percentages or none of that stuff. Everybody in Seat Pleasant, everybody in PG County, Maryland, y'all be riding with me. Feels good to see him come full circle, man. It's great to see, man, 'cause everybody's chasing their dreams of, you know, playing on the biggest stage. [Bobby] To see guys that I grew up with make it so far-- it made it on the lines of "You just keep going, then you can make it." ♪♪♪ Never forget the year he won MVP, and he said to his mom... The odds were stacked against us. Single parent with two boys. You made us believe. You kept us off the street. You put clothes on our backs, food on the table. When you didn't eat, you made sure we ate. You went to sleep hungry. You sacrificed for us. [sniffs] You the real MVP.

[MC] And the NBA 2018 Most Improved Player is... - Victor Oladipo. - Oladipo. ♪♪♪ [Victor] My family's sacrificed so much for me. I used to come here and try to work out every day at 6:00 a.m., before school started. Shout-out to my father, Chris, my mother, Joan, my three sisters, Victoria, Kendra, and Christine. I always say you guys are my before, my now, and my after. You guys are my everything. ♪♪♪ And I remember those mornings used to be so tough. I remember looking at my sisters' faces and them sleeping in a car getting to their schools before the janitor even got there. My mom used to have to wait, um...go to work all day and then wait after practice, go home, get four hours of sleep, and then have to work night shifts because I had a dream. At the end of the day, that's why I play this game. I play it for them. They sacrificed so much for me, I had to do something. ♪♪♪ [Ricky] If we're gonna continue to be the county known for basketball, we have to continue to give back the same way the game has given us so much. [Kevin] I think we in the basketball community-- like, when we combining-- and we always build relationships with each other and combine resources and do things like this, we're pushing our community and our culture forward. [narrator] In 2019, Kevin Durant opened the Durant Center in his hometown of Suitland, Maryland. The state-of-the-art, $13 million facility provides academic, financial, and social resources to youth from low-income backgrounds. The county is good at saying to its residents in very many ways through each, uh--each decade or each generation, "No matter what we're going through, I got you." [John] Guys like Kevin and them-- these guys are now saying, "Okay, I understand the significance of my ability to play basketball. I'm gonna use that to influence a kid who might not have my ability to play it to do other things or to aspire to be successful," and I'm as proud as I can be to see that they're doing that. [Kevin] It might have our name on the side of the building, but it's your home, so enjoy it, make it yours, and the future starts here. [Brown] In any facet of society, whether you're talking education, whether you're talking business, there are those who've come before us upon whose shoulders we stand. [announcer] Rumson! [Bianca] For all the work that each generation did, decade by decade by decade, it fed our ambition and our dreams and our hopes. [Victor] It's just gonna continue to keep being like that, because we live and breathe it here. Prince George's packs a lot of power, a lot of character. We take pride in-- in being from this county. [man] I carry PG like a badge of honor. [Navarro] It comes back to this hunger and this commitment. We are from Prince George's County. We are not playing with nobody. [Victor] I never forget where I come from. I wouldn't be who I am without DeMatha. I wouldn't be who I am without PG County. At the end of the day, this is home. [man] Love, sweat, and tears have all shaped the generational legacy of PG County basketball, but folks from the county know there's still a mysterious essence hard to explain.
