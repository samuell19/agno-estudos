[Siren wailing] [Up-tempo music playing] [Siren wailing] [Horn honking] [Siren wailing] [Siren wailing] [Siren wailing] [Indistinct conversations] Hi. Hi. Thanks. Can I get you something to drink? Yeah, I'll take a pitcher of budweiser, with two glasses. I have a friend coming. - Okay. - Thanks. [Indistinct conversations] Thanks. Do you know what you want to order yet? Yeah. I'm gonna go with the chicken wings. - Yeah. - Thanks. Excuse me, miss. Yes? This may be a coincidence, But you remind me of someone I used to know. Really? What a coincidence. You wouldn't mind telling me who you are? Oh. My name's Gloria. Hi, Gloria. I'm bill. - Are you an actress? - Yeah. I knew it. There's a movie-star beauty about you. Thanks. So, you're an actress. How come I've never heard of you? Ah. Well, I'm still one Of those struggling actresses. I haven't made my big movie break yet. But I do a lot of low-budget indie films, In hopes that that'll get me discovered. With a look like yours, I'm sure one of these days, You'll be discovered and make it big. Thanks for the encouragement. What movies have you been in? Nothing that you would have heard of. [Chuckles] Um, I've done a bunch of indie films Where I'm the featured role, And then I've done some extra work On the big Hollywood-budget films. Good. Background's good. - I'm a movie director. - Great! And I'm directing this movie called "sunset dreams." I really think you should audition For the lead role of Kim. Okay, I'll consider it. Look... Let me give you my card. Give me a call, and I'll get the casting director To set you up with an audition. Okay. Great. [Vehicles passing] [Indistinct conversation] Hey, rod, over here! Hey, it's bill. Hey, man. It's so good to see you again. Yeah, it's been awhile, huh? - About five years or so? - Yeah. Oh, um, this is my girlfriend, nathalie. Hi, nathalie. Nice to meet you. - Yes. - Have a seat. Sure. You know, the last time I saw you Was at your Sundance premier, your movie "four seasons," Which, by the way, swept Sundance. Oh, we had so much fun. Oh, man, I was so drunk. And I was wasted at the after-party. - Remember that? - [Laughing] Yeah. You know what, though? I'm still amazed that "four seasons" did so well And won all those awards at Sundance. It was awesome. And then after that, You did that Hollywood film, "in the sand," right? - I wish I hadn't. - Why? It bombed 'Cause I didn't have creative control, you know, final cut. Look... some of Hollywood's greatest films are indies... "Vertigo," "citizen Kane," and "psycho," 'Cause they were produced independently. And the director had complete creative control and final cut. Hmm. Interesting. It's been all downhill since "in the sand." How come? 'Cause of that disaster, the studios labeled me As an unviable commercial Hollywood director... Too auteur. Don't worry about it. Just keep at it, man. Trust me. Something good will come your way. I hope so. I heard you did quite well in silicon valley. Yeah, I made a lot of money Off these two high-tech start companies... Nct software and mad solar. Good for you. Let's toast to that. Yes. To success. To success. Did you get a chance to read my script? Yeah, I did. So, what did you think? You know, maybe "sunset dreams" will be your comeback movie. [Exhales sharply] I'm betting on it. You know, I don't know too much about the movie business, But I know how to read, and I like your story. I'm glad you like it. You know, my favorite movies about Hollywood Are "sunset boulevard" and "a star is born," But these are two movies made from the studios. There's never been a movie made from the indie perspective... You know, the struggle to make it as an actor, Director, producer, and so on, To get that elusive Hollywood-movie break. And that's why "sunset dreams" is such a unique story. Yeah, it is. So, uh, how much money do you need? $1 million. Wow. That much? Well, $1 million is really considered an ultra-low budget By Hollywood standards. Most Hollywood movies cost around $100 million. Hmm. You know what? I want to finance your movie, but with one condition. What? Anything! You have to put my girlfriend, nathalie, And my adopted son, Tony, in the film. Sure. You got it. Thanks. I'm trying to get into acting, But my background has been in modeling. You are beautiful. You definitely have a supporting role in "sunset dreams." As a matter of fact, I think you should audition for the lead role of Kim. I'd love to. - That's a great idea. - Awesome. I'll set you up with the audition. Thanks. You know what? I'm gonna write you a check for $100,000 To option for the script. You will get the remaining balance of $900,000 After we meet the winning investors. [Sighs] Thanks a lot, man... Mr. executive producer. Ahh. [Laughs] Yesterday it rained dead birds. 5,000 birds fell from the sky and were found dead In beebe, Arkansas, and Kentucky. A pastor has said it is an omen, A religious meaning the end of days. Investigators are inquiring all possible causes To the deaths... Speculation that it could be lightning, storms, And government testing. Also this morning, it rained In a small northern California coastal town of half moon bay. What is so unusual about the rain Is that the color of the rain has turned red. Scientists are testing and examining the rainwater To find out why the rain has turned red. Authorities have advised the public to stay inside While it is raining and to have an umbrella handy. - Gloria? - Yeah? It's me... bill. Oh. Hi. So, we meet again. Yeah. It looks like you're going somewhere far. Yeah. I'm going home. Home? Yes. I'm so sick of this whole acting gig. I'm so sick of the movie business, Hollywood. I have been auditioning so much, it's insane. I've lived here for over five years, And I just haven't gotten lucky yet. Oh, come on. Don't give up that easy. You're so beautiful and talented. I can see that. Just stay a little while longer. It's gonna happen for you. I know it. I mean, I would not be surprised If someday there were a star for you On the Hollywood star walk of fame. Listen, thank you for your encouragement And your kind words, but I'm done with Hollywood. Oh, and I've got to catch that greyhound bus. But thank you. Good luck. I got to go. Bye. Wait, Gloria! Please don't go! Please stop. I'll make you a deal. What? If you audition for the lead role of Kim In my movie "sunset dreams" and don't get it, I will give you $1,000 to help you go home. I could use $1,000. Do we have a deal? Okay. [Indistinct conversations] [Computer beeping] Wait. Wait a minute. Hold it. There's this hot chick Kim in the script, right? So, where are the topless chicks? Right? Where are the sex scenes? I don't see anything in here. We have to have it in here. Absolutely. And there's no fight scenes. There's no blood. There's no guts. But, guys, listen... "sunset dreams"... It's not all about the babes, boobs, and blood. [Indistinct conversations] So, let's go back. And should we ask... can I ask you a question about 349? Um... Bill, "sunset dreams" has a good story. It's a unique story about the struggle to make it in Hollywood As an actor, as a director, as a producer. However, it's a risky investment. And, uh [Chuckles] I think we'd be a little crazy To invest in the film. But you've paid your dues, and I think "sunset dreams" Could be your big comeback movie in Hollywood. You know, with a few minor script revisions, I think "sunset dreams" is gonna be a big hit. So, we've decided to invest $1 million in your movie! Awesome! - Yes! - Yeah, buddy! $1 million! Thank you! Thank you! [Indistinct conversation] Mr. executive producer. Thanks, everyone. We're making a movie! To love somebody means to want to be with that person forever. - Forever? - Forever. To love somebody is to want to be with that person... Forever. Forever? Hi, bill. Hey, guys. What's up? Hey, bill. Gloria's audition was good. She's a beautiful girl. She can act. Now, can we work with her? Of course we can. I got a chance to sit down and talk with Gloria And get to know her a little bit. She has the right attitude to make it in the movie business, And I really think she'd be great as Kim in "sunset dreams." Yeah, but I thought nathalie auditioned well, too. Yeah, but, um, Gloria does have more experience in acting, As you can see from her audition. [Rock music playing] [Cellphone ringing] [Indistinct conversations] Hello? Hi. Gloria? [Vehicles passing] Yes? It's bill from sunset boulevard pictures. Oh, hi. - I have good news. - Yes? We're offering you the lead role of Kim. [Squeals] How wonderful! So, what do you say? Yes, I would love to play Kim in "sunset dreams." Awesome. I think you'll be great as Kim. I know I will. I mean, I'm playing myself. This could be your breakthrough role into Hollywood... You know, your elusive Hollywood-movie break. Yes. So, how about lunch tomorrow to celebrate Your first major movie role? Um, is this a pickup? No, not at all. It's strictly business. Okay. Where? How about pho citi, On the corner of sunset and LA brea, around 1:00? - Okay, great. - Sounds good. See you then. - Bye. - Bye. [Telephone hangs up] So tell me a little more about yourself. I'm from San Francisco. I've always wanted to be an actress, And I actually started when I was 6. - Wow. That young? - Yes. My grandfather, Jack marlowe... He encouraged and supported me Throughout my entire movie career. Wait a second. The legendary actor Jack marlowe? Yeah. Recently, did he pass away? Yeah, but he was 92. It was his time. I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm gonna miss him a lot. He, um... he used to always call me his little angel. So, I guess I don't have to pay you that $1,000 To get on the greyhound bus, do I? Yes, and I'm so glad you don't have to. Cheers. You know, early in my movie career, I made this movie called "replica," And I had cast the perfect actress for it. She was talented and beautiful, just like yourself. She even looked like you. But for budget reasons, "Replica" was never completely produced. It fell apart, and it was never released. And I've never been able to forgive myself for that, For not being able to help out That talented and beautiful actress. But casting you... that is my redemption for "replica." Wow. Thank you so much for helping me with my movie career, And thank you so much For not letting me get on that greyhound bus. No, I had to. After seeing thousands of head shots and hundreds of auditions, Then I saw you... talent, beauty, and grace All mixed in to one. I'm gonna help make you a movie star. What can I do to ever repay you For helping me out in my movie career? Oh, a lot. Like what? [Rock music plays] * all I had was a crazy dream and a fire within my soul * * I had nothing but some crazy schemes way out of my control * * I got to thinking it was fantasy * * and I'll never make it through * * I always knew what I wanted to be, just what I got to do * * I know I'm set for glory * nothing's gonna stop me now * it's my story * and no one's gonna tell me how * * I'm gonna do it right * I'm gonna shine bright tonight * * there were days when I thought * * my dream would fade away and die * * people told me that I got what it takes * * when I lost the will to try * then one day I got ahold of myself * * trying my best to survive * 'cause deep down I knew it so well * * I had to keep my dream alive * I know I'm set for glory * nothing's gonna stop me now * it's my story * and no one's gonna tell me how * * I'm gonna do it right * right, right, right * I kept believing in what I had to do * * there's nothing like the feeling * * when a dream comes true * I know I'm gonna get the glory * * nothing's gonna stop me now * glory * no one's gonna tell me how * glory * nothing's gonna stop me now * it's my story * and no one's gonna tell me how * * I'm gonna do it right - hey, rod. - Hey. - Having fun? - Yeah. You two are together now? Oh, no, we're just friends. I was just showing Gloria Some of "sunset dreams'" filming locations. - Yeah. Right. - [Giggles] We were thinking about going to the LA brea tar pits museum. You guys want to come? - Sure. - Sounds fun. I'll be right back. I got to go to the bathroom. All right. Let's keep going for awhile. [Indistinct conversation] [Ominous music playing] [Water bubbling] [Shouting indistinctly] Somebody, help me! Ow! Ow! Ow! Somebody, help me! - Are you okay? - It stung me. What stung you? Something stung me. What stung you? - A jellyfish. - A jellyfish? Yes, a giant, jumbo jellyfish. Hurry. Somebody call an ambulance. Call 911. Don't worry, miss. We're gonna get help. Please, we need an ambulance now. A woman has been stung on the beach. What happened to her? I don't know... something about a giant, jumbo jellyfish. Please, we need an ambulance now. Where are you located? On the Santa Monica beach, near the pier. They're on their way now. Okay. Thank you. They're coming. Okay. [Waves crashing] Giant, jumbo jellyfish, huh? Hey, guys, what did I miss? A woman was attacked by a giant, jumbo jellyfish. Really? [Siren wailing] [Mid-tempo classical music playing] [Indistinct conversations] It's big. So, what kind of birds are these? Ancient birds. Really? That's cool. Uh, eagles and vultures. How old do you think they are? Real old. Real old. That's cool. I wish Susan could have been here to see this bird skeleton, But she got a disease from that fish that rod cooked. I can get up there. Hey, that's Dr. Jones. Who's Dr. Jones? Oh, someone I recently met. Oh. Hey, Dr. Jones! Hi. So, we meet again. Yeah, what a surprise. Um, these are my friends, bill, Gloria. You remember nathalie and Tony. Oh, hi. Nice seeing you all again. Hey, Dr. Jones, do you have any birds I could play with? [Chuckles] Well, the birds that I have Are way too large and dangerous for you to play with, okay? So, how about a small one? Well, I'll tell you what... I'll send you some lovebirds. Oh, sweet. I can't wait to play with them. Dr. Jones, what are you doing here? Actually, I'm gonna be speaking at a conference About prehistoric birds. Prehistoric birds? Yeah. I mean, don't you know that birds are the descendants Of, uh, dinosaurs? As a matter of fact, prehistoric eagles and vultures Actually lived right here in this area, Which is now Hollywood. But, of course, prehistoric eagles and vultures Are much larger than the present-day vultures or eagles, Specifically the errant eagle, Or the archaeological name is neogyps errans. It's actually the ancestor of the modern-day golden eagle. And the merriam's teratorn Is actually the ancestor of the modern-day vulture. Now, like I told you guys when we met in half moon bay, These prehistoric eagles and vultures Actually attacked cavemen. [Both moaning] [Birds chirping] [Birds screeching] As a matter of fact, many prehistoric eagles and vultures Actually died and fell into the tar. And some actually flew in, got stuck, and drowned and died. As a matter of fact, "LA brea" means "the tar" in English. But what's really fascinating about this tar is, Not only does it totally preserve the bird's skeleton, But it also preserves the blood vessels and the DNA. - Whoa. - Wow. Well, I've got to go. I'm speaking at the next session of the conference. It was nice seeing you all again. - Bye, Dr. Jones. - Goodbye, Dr. Jones. * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * oh, no, oh, no * down, down, getting down, down * * I ain't the naive lover I used to be * * and I know you're lying when you say you're over me * * it's in my self-destructive nature to pity you * * nothing compares to what you've put me through * * so, give me a call * I really don't mind at all * I've seen the writing on the wall * * you'll never take that vow * and I'm too far gone to care about you now * * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * down, down, getting down, down, down, getting down * * oh, no, oh, no * down, down, getting down, down * * it took me awhile, but I'm back up on my feet * Did you know the catalina islands were Where Norma Jean lived with her Navy husband Before she became Marilyn Monroe? Really? Wait. Didn't Natalie wood die here in some kind of an accident? Yeah, she did. You know, all the lead cast In "rebel without a cause" died young... James Dean at 24 and Natalie wood at 43. Even the supporting cast... Sal mineo died at 37. I guess, for some actors, Dying young is the price you pay for stardom. That's very interesting. Wow. I really hope that I don't die young if I become a star. Me too. Gloria, um, I wanted to congratulate you On getting the lead role in "sunset dreams." Thanks. I heard that you got a supporting role. Yeah. Yeah. It's my first acting gig, so I'm really excited about it. I know that you'll do great. Thanks. If you have any acting advice, I'd love to hear it. Of course.

Well, I just landed a little role in a movie Called "sunset dreams." [Gasps] Oh, that's awesome! Oh, my gosh. Bill here is the director. Oh, bill, thank you for taking care of nathalie. And rod's the executive producer. The executive producer? That is fantastic. Oh, my gosh. Rod and bill, do you think You could give me a little role in the film, Or how about a feature role in the film? Well, if not, how about at least a scene with nathalie? We can work something out, right? Yeah, definitely. Oh, that would be so much fun! [Chuckles] So, nathalie, when are you two gonna get married? Seriously. You guys have been together a long time. And I'd love to see you get married and have children. Um, well, ask rod. Rod? Um, when the right time comes along? When? Uh, in time? Well, you know what? I'm not getting any younger, And I would love to have grandchildren Before I'm too old to play with them. Well, we'll think about it. Anyways, please stay and have dinner with us. - I would love to. - Yeah, mom, stay. That would be fun. I'll get a chair for you. Yeah. We'll get you a gin and tonic. Okay.

[Suspenseful music playing] [Animals trumpeting] [Birds squawking] [Animals snarling] [Animal trumpeting] [Bird chirping] [Birds screeching] "Sunset dreams," scene 27, take 3. Stand by. And action. To love somebody is to want to be with that person forever. Forever? And cut. That was good. [Birds screeching] Get a hanger! [Indistinct shouting] [All grunting] Yuck! Ugh. Die, birds. [Wings flapping] Nathalie, give me your gun. Seriously? You're a terrible shot. Bill, take it. It's okay. Hey, let's get the hell out of here. Let's go. [Exhales sharply] - I'm sure. - I want to. It's supposed to be so fun. I heard Jeff's gonna be there. - Ooh! - He totally likes you. - You have a crush on him. - I do. What are you gonna wear? I'm not too sure yet. I was thinking about borrowing something from you. Oh, man. Well, you know what? I'm gonna murder you! [Screaming] [Grunting] [Wings flapping] [Birds screeching] [Gasping] Oh, my God. What is that? [Whimpering] Unh! Unh! [Breathing heavily] [Gunshots] Oh, shit. She's dead. She's dead. They're all dead. She's dead. - They're all dead. - She's dead. Dead. All right. Let's get out of here. Come on. Let's go. [Birds screeching] [People screaming] Help! Help us! Over here! Help me! Help! [Screaming continues] [Screeching continues] [Grunting] [Grunting] [Screeching continues] [Indistinct shouting] Are you okay? Ah! Get off of me! Aah! [Indistinct shouting] [Screeching continues] Help! Help me! I'm over here! - Help! - Look! Help! Help me! [Gunshots] Help! Help! Aah! [Gasps] Hey, look, they stopped. - Oh, thank God. - Oh, God. - [Exhales sharply] - Yeah. [All breathing heavily] She's dead. She's dead. Another one? We should have helped her. Look. The birds are flying away. [Birds screeching] Quick... see if anyone's still left alive. I already checked. Everyone is dead. Yeah, I did, too. There's no one left. It's armageddon, the end of days. You know, I saw on the news last week That thousands of birds had died And fallen out of the sky in Arkansas. I wonder if this has something to do with that. Birds falling out of the sky? Yeah. And even more birds Had died in a small northern coastal California town Called half moon bay. Half moon bay? And what's even stranger Is the rain in half moon bay had turned red. Strange and weird things Are happening in the environment right now. Guys, can we just change the subject? "Jaws" happens to be one of my favorite movies. Are you really worried about the movies right now? Yeah, seriously. Why not? I mean, the birds are attacking us. I feel like I'm in a movie. In fact, my next script will be about birds attacking Hollywood. Great idea. Hey, will you cast me in it? Yeah. Me too. I can direct it. Sure, if you can find a producer to option my script. My best friend, rod, here... He's the executive producer of "sunset dreams." I'm sure he'd love to take a look at your script. Yeah, that's a great idea Of turning this birds attack into a movie. You know what? It could be just as big as the "jaws" franchise. Yeah. Or maybe as big as "saw" or "paranormal activity" franchise. Guys, we need to slow down and stop daydreaming And to get the hell out of here Before these birds attack us on this Hollywood studios back lot. - Which way should we go? - Let's go that way. - Let's go. - Okay. [Dramatic music playing] God, it stinks. It smells like something's dead. Is he dead? Is he breathing? He's dead. Damn. It's locked. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Help! Get me out of here! Help! Get me out of here! Hey, guys, somebody's in the cabin. - Huh? - Huh? Hey, wait. Hi. Hi. Are you all right? Yes. [Exhales heavily] The birds attacked the set and killed everybody. Oh, my God. And I survived just by hiding in this cabin. What is your name? Jessica. I'm will, and I'm a screenwriter. Why are the birds attacking? I wish I knew the answer to that. Maybe it's global warming. - Global warming? - Yeah. A few years ago, rod and I were attacked In a small town called half moon bay. The resident bird expert there... He said that it might be global warming. It has to be global warming. Yeah. Why don't you join us? We're all trying to get out of here. Yes. Come on, guys. Let's go this way. All right. [Dramatic music playing] Hey, I know you. You're that tree hugger. Yes. - We met in the forest. - Yes. But I thought you loved the trees so much And you protected them And that you would never leave the forest. Yeah, but after we spoke that day, There was a forest fire that burned and destroyed everything. Look at the decimation of global warming, What it's done to the forests and the trees. They're all dead. And that fire almost killed me. I barely escaped. But Annie saved me. You see, rod, I didn't want to leave the forest. But then I stayed too long, And the smoke from the fire made me sick, coughing. I passed out. [Coughing] [Coughing] Hey, mister, wake up. We've got to get out of here. We've got to get out of here. [Coughs] And that's how I met Annie, and now she's my lovely wife. And we have a baby girl. Congratulations. Thanks. But aren't you two known As "the no emitting family" to the public? Yes. We have a TV reality show called "the no-emitting family." Yes. I saw you guys on TV the other day. My dad is a Hollywood TV producer, so he suggested That we start a TV reality show called "the no-emitting family" Because my husband, tom, here is so pro-environmental. The show documents everything that we do that's green. That means no co2 admitting, all non-polluting activities, And we do solar, we grow our own vegetables, And we only buy goods That are from sources that are non-polluting. And actually we're really big fans of the iPad and e-books Because they're just cutting down too many trees To make books, you know? I think I saw an episode That said you guys don't use toilet paper. That's right. Toilet paper is made from trees. Trees are cut down to make toilet paper. In fact, we haven't used toilet paper in many years. - [Laughs] - Are you two aware That the eagles and vultures are attacking? Yes, but they don't seem to bother us, Probably because we live a green, non-emitting lifestyle. Well, it was nice seeing you guys again, and your family. - Guys, let's go. - Let's get out of here. Hey, rod, there are people in that car. Let's stop and see if anyone's still alive. Yeah, good idea. They're dead. Grab their gun. Dustin. Hell, yeah. [Laughs] Let's get out of here. Let's go. [Rock music playing] [Speaking indistinctly] Hey, look, there's someone laying on the ground In front of the movie theater. Let's go check it out. He's dead. Let's go inside. - You go that way. - All right. - Dustin. - Yep. That way. [Indistinct shouting] My God, the birds are attacking everyone in the theater. Let's get the hell out of here. - Shit! - Aah! Go! Go! Go! [Birds screeching] Hey, rod, I know this shortcut through the cemetery. Yeah, that's a great idea. Let's do it. [Snarling] Hey, look. There's some people over there. We should stop and help them. [Ominous music playing] - Hello? Need any help? - Hey! Over here! [Snarling] Whoa, guys. There's something wrong with them. They're zombies. - What?! - Stop. Don't move. Don't come any closer. Aaaah! Aah! Want some?! Get some! There's one. - Yep. - Get her. Unh! Aah! [Gunshots] She's dead. Let's go. Yeah, come on! Go! Go! Go! [Gunshots] [Indistinct shouting] Aah! Next time, we're not taking any more shortcuts. Fair enough. [Snarling] We should have brought Jessica with us. No, she's dead. She was bitten by that zombie. If we would have brought her, She would have infected all of us. Yeah, will, he's right. Hey, we should go in that zoo. There might be people in there. Wait. Wait. Wait. The last time we took a detour was through that cemetery, And do you remember what happened? We were attacked by those zombies. I'm not going through that again. Look, it's just a zoo. There might be people in there that need our help. Yes. But what if the animals try to attack us? We can defend ourself. We have guns. [Round chambers] Okay. But if something happens, I'm gonna be doing the driving. Fine. [Birds chirping] [Animals yowling] Hey, mister. We didn't mean to alarm you. It is okay. Can I help you with something? Yeah. Are you aware that the birds are attacking people? Yes, but they do not attack us. They are my friends. Friends? Yes, because I understand why they are attacking. Why? Because all the animals in the zoo Are getting sick from disease. I think global warming might have something to do with it... All the animals, all the birds getting sick. It is killing them. Is there any way to stop the birds' attack? No, there are too many of them. But if we all try to live a greener lifestyle... A greener lifestyle? Yes. This zoo is powered by solar energy. All the zoo vehicles are electric-powered. The birds' attack was just an omen. The seas of the earth are rising Because the ice in the arctic is melting at an accelerated rate. It only takes a 2-degree rise in the earth's temperature For all of civilization to be underwater. If we do not stop polluting the earth now, This zoo and all the cities at sea level will be underwater. Interesting. Yeah. Well, it was nice meeting you. Guys, let's hit the road. [Birds screeching] No! Wait! From now on, bill, I'm doing the driving. You know what, rod? It wasn't the animals that killed Dustin. It was those damn birds. Hey, rod, look. There's some people right there. We should stop and see if they need any help. Okay. Are you okay? [Grunts] [Grunting] Oh, my God, they're fighting. We... we should help them. [All screaming] Help! Come on, rod! Come on! [Exhales sharply] Will, wake up! Will! Yeah, you're okay. - Come on! - Will, get up! - Come on! - [Groans] [Indistinct yelling] [Engine shuts off] Damn. We're out of gas. Well, look. There's a hotel up there. Maybe they have some gas. Maybe. [Keypad beeps] [Indistinct conversations] [Birds screeching] The birds are coming! Will!
