[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] I got a Cessna down on the 405. Barry, you better get on it. Anything I can do from here? Yeah. You can show this to Ed and make some coffee. Thank you. ANNOUNCER: Lowery, pulls up for a three. That's no good. [CHUCKLES] Ed Arnold, you're not even watching Chanel 5. Loyola Marymount's playing Portland. I love this Gathers kid. What Gathers kid? ED: The one that can fly. ANNOUNCER: ...out the back running down the left side line. Alley-oop to Gathers. NBA Play. Unbelievable! Straight pass by Terrell Lowery who's on the left side and asked for it. Threw it up, perfect pass, Hank caught it, jammed it right though... ED: Oh, my God. Oh, no. ANNOUNCER: Hank Gathers on the floor, collapsed. He was standing right beyond half-court and all of a sudden he just fell down. Trainers are all on the court. Hank's mother is rushed on the court. Lisa, find out where they've taken him. I'll send Tommy and the crew. You get down there and help. Lawson, I don't know a thing about basketball. This isn't about basketball. [SIREN WAILING] ANNOUNCER OVER PA: Dr. Walker to Radiology. There isn't any word yet, so get us some coffee, this could be a long night. Oh, I don't think you're allowed to smoke those in here. Hey, didn't this happen sometime before? You're thinking of Len Bias. He OD'ed on coke the night the ha was drafted by the Celtics. So you think this guy was into drugs too? Drugs? Why drugs? 'Cause he'a black, right? Okay, man. Take it easy. Take it easy. Look, I didn't mean any harm. Just leave us alone. All right? Sorry, Bo. That young man is Bo Kimble. He grew up with Gathers. They played on the same team on high school. I would liked to have interviewed him. Nice work. Sorry. Bank shouldn't have been out there. I should've just flat refused to play with him. Stop it, man. You know nobody could keep Hank from playing. I remember lots of times Hank would have been better staying off the court... [PEOPLE LAUGHING] BOY: I dare you to drive. Here, Hank. Yo, man, Hank. You all right? You see how I picked his pocket? Come on, man, let's quit. Scott Hardly, you give up? They're killing us. Come on. Let's play. Hank, you better come home. Derrick, watch this. I'll give these guys a facial. Big Loo, is looking for you. and she is not happy. Nice try, guys. Better luck next time. Didn't you see the way me and Heat were handling those "Dudes". Hank, they were creaming you guys. And we showed them a thing or two. Yeah, like how to get your butt kicked. Anyway, you were supposed to be home to help mama Moo. She's gonna gawp on you, Hank. Big Loo? Oh, hardly. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I figure another four inches, and I'll be able to palm. What if you're all through growing, Hank? What if you're some kind of freak of nature, and you're the fattest kid ever to stop growing at 11? Then you'll never be able to palm the ball. I ain't through growing. And what do you mean, I ain't gonna be able to palm the ball? You never know. I'm gonna grow. And that's all there is to it. MAMA: So, how's everybody doing in here? Hank? Did you finish all your homework? You check. Honey, you think I don't believe you? Give it here. Let me see. Give it here. Let me see this. Mm-hm. Oh. [SIGHS] Oh! You know, I've prayed long and hard for this. For Hank to do his homework? Oh, hush, dearie. No. No, for a nice clean home, where my kids wouldn't have to worry about drug dealers and thugs hanging around them all the time. Mama, we just moved down the street. It's not like we living with the rich folks. Okay. So, we have a little ways to go. We'll get there. Yeah. As soon as I sign with the Sixers I'll buy the biggest house there is. Oh, Hank, you make me happy enough if you just keep up with your school work, okay? But in the mean time, when ya'll look out that window, ya'll will see a tree. [BOTH LAUGH] What tree? It's a great tree, mom. Can make the all star team for trees. Thank you, Hank. Good night, mama. Good night. Good night, boy. Good night. Okay, now you go to bed. Derrick, I'm telling you, you wouldn't be able to show these guys how to play. All right. No question. You want me, got it? Champion of the world, and all of North Philly. I'm telling you, man... I'm the doctor, and this is my house-call. [BLOWS WHISTLE] Right over here. All right, welcome to try-outs, gentlemen. Some of you may know, my name is Father Dave. Now if you came here to play, you came to the wrong place. We don't play anything here. That's what playgrounds are for. This gym is for guys who are willing to work, and becoming a team. Now, line up on the base line. All I want each of you to do is dribble the ball out to the foul line and dribble it back. That's all I want you to do. Let's go. Yo, Father, watch this. [ALL LAUGHING] [CLEARS THROAT] Give me quiet or give me laps. Pass it here. But... I've seen enough. Just let me try it again. What is your name, son? Hank. Hank Gathers. Okay, give me the ball, go over there. Next. Specs. I got them. Man, you know I do. Hank, all he wanted us to do was dribble up and back. So what's the big deal? You seem to be the only one who messed it up. Hey, man, I'm sure I'm gonna be cut. Me too. Hey, Specs, you know, somebody's got to ride the pipe or the starters get tired. I don't remember Father Dave mentioning a starting team. Figure it out, D, it's gotta be you, Raymond, Lorenzo, me ans Douglas. Starting Derrick and Douglas up front, Lorenzo and Raymond at the guards, and, Mike, you're at pivot. Ready... ALL: Break! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right, you guys, now don't bankrupt me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Are we feeling sorry for ourselves? I'm better than most of them. No, you're not, Gathers, you're just bigger. I could take them all one-on-one. I, I got the moves, Father Dave, you know I do. What I know is you got a couple of playground tricks. I don't play that game. In fact, you haven't shown me anything except you got a big mouth and a bad attitude. All flash and no cash. All start and no finish. Don't you come moaning to me about game time as long as you gonna play that way. [SIGHS] I don't see why I have to go to some stupid Catholic school anyway? I hate it and I hate Father Dave. Hank, I paid to see you to St. Elizabeth's because it's the best chance you have of making something of yourself. Hank, you listen to me. Now, if I didn't think you had it in you to do all sorts of wonderful things, I wouldn't even bother. But I'm telling you, baby, you're special. You can do anything in this world you want to do. Tell that to Father Dave. No, you tell him. Yeah, right. Not in words, baby, you show him. You prove him wrong. You show him that you are as good as you think you are. You show the man that he's a fool for not playing you in those games. But you show him, baby. Don't you tell him. You show him, okay? All right. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] That was a great game. I did all the work. Get off me, little punk. Punk? I'm gonna show these guys how to play. Yes! Yes! [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah. All my free throws, you know. [ALL CHANTING] City champ! City champ! City champ! Okay, okay, okay. Not yet, you're not. I know you've worked very hard but that's a tough team down there. Father Dave, we're gonna drop them guys like a bad trans... All right. Now, I'll feel very proud of you as long as you play hard, and play like a team. Right? Having said that... City what? ALL: City Champ! Get them! All right. FATHER DAVE: I don't care that you lost, it's how you lost that kills me. You played selfish, and you played stupid. You didn't look like a team out there, you looked like a street gang. Everything we talked about, everything that we worked on went right out the window. Now, go on. Go on and get dressed. Go on. You talked hard to those kids. Yes, ma'am, I did. You know, when I first heard about you, I was a little suspicious about what this white man was doing living up here. Sometimes I wonder myself. You get thrown out of some place else? No, ma'am, I just left. Oh. And where might that be? Immaculate Heart. [CHUCKLES] You left there, to come here? But then, honey, you must be the stupidest white man I ever seen. Here, honey, Lucille Gathers. Mrs. Gathers, I'm very happy to meet you. Those are both fine boys that you have there. They're like night and day. You know with Derrick, you always know where you stand 'cause he's steady. But Hank, he's always trying to run before he can walk. He's got s lot of good energy. Hm. Tell me about it. What we have to make sure of is that he learns how to use it. [SIREN WAILING] What do you want? I wanted to say I was sorry. You said that already. Look, I said something stupid. Yeah. You know, I was standing over there listening to you talk about this guy I never met, and I was thinking that there were probably a whole lot more people who were thinking the same stupid thing I did. So? Look, I'm an intern at Chanel 5. Me and Hank did that too. I know. Ed Arnold's real broken up. He's a good man. Bank and I had some good times with him. Bank? Hank. Hank the Bank. Give it to Hank, it's in the bank. [GRUNTS] Were you two always best friends? Not hardly. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] That's Bo Kimble. He's the one that knocked Bobby out in the summer league. We got winners. That's right. [BOTH LAUGHING] Thinks he's pretty nice, don't he? Hey, Hank, I think he's pretty nice. I mean, the boy can flat play. Let's go in, Derrick. We got winners. We called it. Hey, player. Can't wait all day, right? Come on. Championship of the world and all North Philly. [CHUCKLES] Take it out. Winners ball. Winners out. Okay. Winners ball, winner's out. All right, this time. Come one. [SNAPS FINGER] Let's go. That's one. [MOCKINGLY] That's one. Only when you don't get, brother. Come on. Derrick. One for us. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] You all right? Play. All right. Twenty one. Let's play one more. That's okay. Oh, come on. Let's play one more, man. No thanks, guys. What's the matter? You scared? We just took you guys out, 21-4. We was just warming up, man. One more, come on. Wait... [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] All right, be like that. Chump. No, no. It ain't about that. Oh, yeah. I've seen him. He's a natural. He's the kind of kid that looks like he was born with a basketball on his hand. He ain't that good. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry, Hank. You're just not on that league yet. Bo Kimble is a serious basketball player. Oh, come on, Father. Do you know how hard I practice? This isn't play of lot of hoops. There's a big difference. You know, Father, it is a good thing you're my friend and all. 'Cause anybody talk to me like that who I don't like, I'd go off on them. Hey, Hank. Philly -75, Celtics -62. Third court. All right. Hey. My, boy. Ssh. How're you doing at school, Hank? Dave, would you lighten up? You mother tells me that you're failing math. There's no such thing as pro-math. You're wrong, Hank. There's pro-math, there's pro-English, there's pro-history. Mm-hm. The way I figure, in the NBA score, stats, and signing bonuses all the math I need to know. FRIEND 1: NBA? [CHUCKLES] What did you smoke? [ALL LAUGH] Tell him, Specs. Yo, Specs. I'm gonna get you... Come on, man get you... What? What? Just sit down. You're just starting to learn what you need to know. Get ready. Ready? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Look at that, gentlemen. Give me some mighty fine sister. Forget it, man. Be serious. They won't have anything to do with us. Follow me. [CLEARS THROAT] Ah, excuse me. Um, can I talk to you for a moment? Is he talking to me? [ALL LAUGH] I mean, look. What's your name, baby? I mean, hey, girl, you looking good. You know what I'm saying? Ah... I mean, like, uh, maybe you and me could get together and get busy? [ALL LAUGH] Wait. Wait. Okay. You couldn't even spell busy, okay? Oh. Oh. B-u-s-y. Easy. Oh, come on. I don't got time for this. Let's go. No, no, no. Wait, wait. Come on. Hold up. The skinny one's kinda cute. Come on. Skinny? Skinny. What's your name, baby? I'm Hank "The Bank" Gathers. Oh, Hank "The Bank" huh? You're gonna be a big man on the varsity, Hank "The Crank"? [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, we don't find out till next week. Oh, then, uh... next week we shall see what we shall see, huh? Hank, The Wank. Oh, girl. Oh, hey. My name is Derrick and, uh-- Man, shut up. I like to get to know both of ya'll. Uh... Ain't she fine? She just... Can I have your number? ALL GIRLS: No. Hi, mama. Bye, mama. What are you doing up so early? They're posting the final varsity roster this morning. Okay. Well, sit down and have some meal. I'm not hungry, mama. What? I'd never thought I hear those words out of that boy's mouth. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] HANK: Yes! Yes! I made it! I made it! Man, you never make these free throws. Shut up. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Try it again. Spec, man, I can't believe you didn't make the team. Ah, man, it's okay. Just frees up my time for more important matter, that's all. Could you hold these for me, please? Hey. You see me at the varsity? [COUGHS] Oh please. They must be scraping the bottom of the barrel this year. What you mean, "bottom of the barrel"? Bottom of the barrel. Uh... I'm going to my moms, you wanna come with me? She's, uh, at work. You mean now? I mean, we could stop and get something to drink, if you really want to. I don't drink liquor. Oh, really? Yeah. What else don't you do? [BOTH LAUGHING] Why don't you tell your friends bye. Bye. Later. ALL: Bye. Can I come? HANK: No. GIRL: Bye. Yo, Specs. Look out, man. MAMA: Hank. Could you come here for a minute, please? Sure, mama. What's up? Sit down, baby. Hank, um... You know, you can come to me, don't you? Mm-hm. You know that no matter what happens, I'm on your side, right? Yeah, mama. You and me, we're a team. Mm. That's good. Okay. Then, maybe you can explain this phone call I just got. [CLEARS THROAT] Some girl and her mama said that she's pregnant and you're the father. You're just a high school kid. What are you doing getting some kid pregnant? [SOBBING] What about college? What about making something of your life? I... How could you not come to me? I was scared, mama. Oh! I wanted to tell you. I'm sorry, mama. [CRYING] You know... [LAUGHS] You were always trying to grow up faster than you needed too. Well... But now, I guess you just don't have any choice, do you? Come here, baby. [BOTH CRYING] I'm sorry, mama. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [BABY GURGLING] I'm a father. You? I'm an uncle. [CHUCKLES] Uncle Derrick. [CHUCKLES] An uncle's cool, I guess. Go on, Hank. Go on in there. Get in there now. But you just be careful with him, okay? I just want you to think about what you're walking into. When you're holding your baby for the first time, it's a feeling you'll never forget. You do understand what I'm saying, don't you? Boy! Do you understand what I am saying? Uh-hm. I doubt it. Get in there anyway. Go on, boy. Go. DEREK: Go on, Hank. [BABIES CRYING] [LAUGHING] Yo, Lez. Check it out. I had a baby. Have a cigar. All right. Have a cigar. Just one. All right. Hey, Bo. Have a cigar. I don't smoke. [CHUCKLES] Of course not, man. These are candy. Check it out, I had a baby. I'm a daddy. I heard. Ain't you gonna say, "congratulations," or you know... Get... What's up with you, man? Are you stupid or just crazy? What do you mean? It's like everything you do, Hank. It's all a game. Just a game. I'm naming you Aaron. 'Cause it goes so natural with Hank. Hank and Aaron, me and you. Yeah, we're a team. You don't have to worry about nothing. 'Cause what ever happens, I'm gonna take care of you. Mm-hm. I promise you that. Like it or not, you brought a child onto the world. Now, you gonna have to decide how to treat it. Him, Father. "It's" a him. How are you going to feed him, Hank? You know, he's with her and her family. That's your plan? Come on, Father Dave. Recess is over. I know that. Well, what are you gonna do now? I'm gonna make my son proud. How? What you mean? I'm gonna play ball, I'm gonna make millions. You and a million other kids. Are you willing to bet your sons dinner on basketball? It's best bet we got. I sure as hell hope not. Don't do this to me, Father Dave. All this time you've been telling me that if I go out there and work my butt off, that it'll happen for me. Now, what are you saying? Don't even try, don't even bother? But it's not just you anymore. Don't you think I know that? Man, Father, I held him. No. Don't count me out, Father. I'm gonna do this. I mean, I got a long way to go. But I just know that I can do this. [SIGHS] I hope so, Hank. You know, I've always been on your side. I promise you, Father, that when those scouts start coming around, it won't just be Bo Kimble they're looking at. I promise you that. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] I was open. When you get the hoop. He won't give me the ball, I can get my own. [CROWD CHEERING] [CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Gathers... Scouts. What? College recruiters. It's sure they don't live around here. [BOTH LAUGHING] HANK: Okay. Finally, made one. Come on, Hank. You're gonna be here all day. Let's go home. Man, I got to keep shooting these free throws. It's the weakest part pf my game. I got 25 more of those. Damn. Come on. You see that? You getting tired, let's go. [ALL CHEERING] Get him. So, how much attention is Gathers really getting? Lots of letters, personal visits. La Salle is really interesting. He wanted to go to a local school? They've got a good program. [LAUGHS] We got more for this kid than just basketball program. They've also got a good school. Yeah. Well, I like him. I like him a lot, and I'll make you a promise, at USC he'll get a good education and a good basketball program. Besides a kid from here should go away for school any how. You're always trying to make her proud of me. You know? [CHUCKLES] Always do. You know, if I can just give her something back. You know? You just got to ease up on your self. Let the game come back to you. Man I-- No, you just nervous 'cause there are scouts out there. I don't think that's what it is, Hank. That ain't it, man. I know I'm nervous. That's because they looking at you, of course you got to be nervous. They're looking at you too. That's my point. No, they're not, man. They're not looking at me, aye. I mean, it's you. It's you and Bo. I mean, if it was just us on the team, man, there wouldn't be a scout in the house. It's you, Hank. You and Bo, man. You and Bo. [CROWD CHEERING] You should've got back. They're killing us on the break, man. I was back, where the hell were you? Give me that. I got it. [GRUNTING] CROWD: Oh. [WHISTLE BLOWS] REFEREE: 32 and 12, you're out of here. [CROWD BOOING] You really know how to screw things up, don't you? Me? All you had to do was let go. All you had to do was let go. You don't seem to get it. I'm trying to win basketball games. Bo, I wanna win just as bad as you do. Sure could've fooled me. You know why? Just because you think the only way this team is gonna win is if you do everything. You can't do it alone, Bo. Who else is there? There's me! [SCOFFS] There's you. [LAUGHS] Yeah, there's me. [SIGHS] Maybe I lost it out there. Yeah, you did. Hey, you know what? And so did you. And to keep fighting each other, it ends up hurting us both, and we both end-up looking bad. Okay. So? So... We're only on the same team for another couple of months. Why don't we go out there, and play the best high school hoops those scouts have ever seen. And then, we are out of each other's lives for good. Well, come on, Bo. The Hank and Bo Show. No, no, no. Okay. The Bo and Hank Show. Whatever you want. What'd you say? [SIGHS] [MIMICKING SIGH] [MIMICKING SIGH] [CHUCKLES] That's supposed to mean yes? Well, come on, Bo, you can say it. Come on. Let me help you. it ain't that hard. Come on, you ready? Okay. I'll give you the whole sentence. Okay, Hank, it sounds good to me. Come on. You know, Hank, you crazy. Who me? Yeah. That's what they tell me. [LAUGHING] All right. [CROWD CHEERING] Pit ball. Ready to go? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Okay. Thanks, man. [CROWD CHEERING] Gathers. [CROWD CHEERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, Bo. In lots of recruitment visit? Some. Good schools? Pretty good. Yeah. You see, everybody's telling me to go here and don't go there. And do this and... I was just wondering if it was the same thing for you? Yeah, it is. Eh, Bo. I hope it didn't take too much out of you. I mean, saying all that in one time. So you going to USC? The football school? They won the league in basketball, last year. You can do no better than that. Oh, my man Hank knows what he is doing. He's headed to the new frontiers, brothers. Southern California. So. Cal. Home of show-time and fine women running on beach with floss bikinis on. That's right. [LAUGHS] Oh, finally. Hasn't been a descent player come out of there since that kid-- Ruined that boy. Ruined a lot of kids. Pull 'em down there with a bunch of big talk, something happens, somebody better comes along, next thing you know... out of there. What, you some kind of expert now, Ray? You're damn right. Happened to my nephew down in Florida. Blew his knee playing football. Sorry, we can't use you no more. Two years of college, boy couldn't read a letter. Not they lick? They didn't care. [LAUGHS] BARBER: Where's Bo going? On Kentucky, I think. Now, that's a basketball college. Why don't you go with him? [LAUGHS] No, thank you. After this year, we're going our separate ways. Uh-uh. It's been fun, but where ever he goes, I don't particularly need to be. Well, you go to California, you won't have to worry. Yo, you sure he didn't cut too much in the back, man? 'Cause you know, me and my girls don't like it when it's too short in the back. You know that, Hank. You look beautiful. There's no other way to say it. Yeah, that's it. Hey, why you get all duded up like this? Sometimes, I just like, you know, can't restraint myself. I could just... feeling like, you know, I just wanna... kiss you, man. What? Get off! [ALL LAUGHING] HANK: You know, you can't outrun me. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Yo, excuse me, brothers. But I got a little business to take care of. I chase you in it, baby. Look, I'll check you all out later, Specs. Yo, Specs, man. Yeah, what's going on, Bank? Specs man, we've been friends a long time, right? Yeah. But I got to ask you not to bring that stuff around here with those kids. You asking me? Or you telling me? It's up to you, man. That's cold, Bank. That's real cold. And you know, I never figured you for the high and mighty routine. I mean, now that you got your little scholarship and your California University, what do you get off telling me what I can't do for my own self? Listen, Specs, I don't like it. What you do is up to you. But when you start dealing to these kids, man, I got to throw my foot down. And what if I say no. I don't think you will. Why? Because you are the all mighty Hank "The Bank" Gathers? No. No. Because I still believe that you the difference between right and wrong. Come on. [SIGHS] Yeah. What was that about? Let's just say... I will be glad when I get to California. [CHUCKLES] Here we go again. Soon, I'll be out there with those palm trees, and string bikinis, and it'll be summer time all year long. Sounds awful good, Hank. In fact, it sounds too good for you. Yeah? Let me take this opportunity to thank the all little people, like you, Bo, who helped me along my way, and I'll be thinking about you when you're freezing your butt off in Kentucky. You do like hillbillies, don't you, Bo? Who's going to Kentucky? I thought for sure you were. Not me. Oh, okay, Bo, end the mystery. Where you going? We are... [YAWNING] dying to know. [CHUCKLES] Where you said to me all that talk about palm trees, bikinis and things. What you mean? I saw it last week, man. We're brother Trojans. Great. [LAUGHS] It's great. Yes. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Do you know what I read? No, Hank. What'd you read? The average salary in the NBA is $350,000. And the guys picked in the first round of the opening round, you know the guys in the lottery? They make really big money. Are you sure this is the student parking lot? I think so. Hey. Can I help you? Uh... No. No, thanks. I'll manage. It's okay. Hey, it's okay. We live here too. We're basketball players. For USC. Oh. Right. Sorry. I, I didn't know. It's okay. We don't know you, either. And if all we know you could be swiping this stuff. [ALL LAUGHING] Yeah, right. Hey, I'm Hank Gathers. Hi. And, uh, this is Bo Kimble. Forrest Palmer. I play tennis. Really? Yeah. Uh... That's great! I always wanted to take up tennis. Really? Yeah. Lovely game, tennis. Very, very elegant. [ALL LAUGHING] Bo? Bo, you awake? No. Man, would you still go to school if you had as much money as Forest? You know, enough to buy a Porche and all that? I don't know. You? [LAUGHS] My mom would still make me. Bo? What? Listen, man. I don't care what it takes, I don't care how much work we got to do, when it comes time to go pros, we got to picked in the first round. We got to be lottery picks, Bo. Is that all? What do you say, man? I say, we just got to USC, and going pro is years away. Lottery, Bo. What do you say? Go to sleep, Hank. Say it, Bo. Lottery. Lottery. Good night, Bo. Lottery. [SIGHS] [BLOWS WHISTLE] Let's go. All right, go. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Gathers. Let me tell you one more time where this play is supposed to go. The same place it all supposed to go. Did you something, Gathers? No, sir. Let me remind you that last year there were three guys over 6'10'' at UCLA alone. So while you're trying to post up guys that are half a foot taller than you, Dennis could be sinking the jumper all the long. Just get the ball to Dennis. You're not on the playground anymore. Just get it to Dennis. He's our first option. All right, son. Let's do it now. Come on, let's go, every body. Let's go. Come on, Hank, let's go. Let's go! [CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING] Bo Kimble. You just spent your entire day on the bench. Where are you going next? Shut up, Hank. You know, we... [LAUGHS] We have this conversation every, every two or three weeks. You're driving yourself nuts, you know. It isn't personal. It has nothing to do with you. The offense just happens to be designed that way right now. HANK: What offense? You know, this is the first time in my life I've been in a loosing team, Spence. Hank. And I don't like it. You're a freshman. A freshman. Give yourself a chance. But if we were winning, It would be one thing. But, I say, "Great. The coach knows what he's doing." But this ship is sinking. Hank, you gonna have to have patience. I came to play, not to sit. I came to play, and I've come too far to watch this team loose from the bench. Okay. And we are here with the surprise guest for tonight's varsity-alumni dinner, Mr. Hank Gathers and Mr. Bo Kimble. Surprise my butt. Give me that thing. What? You don't know what you're doing. Oh, and you do? Uh-huh. When I finish my career in the NBA, I'm gonna have a career in broadcasting. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, Our very special guest this evening is that sensitive, and, oh, so quiet, young god, Mr. Bo Kimble. [PRETENDS CROWD APPLAUDING] He doesn't say much, folks, but maybe he'll grace us with a word or two. And we think it's important that the alumni have the opportunity to meet the athletes and the student leaders in a small or intimate setting like this. So thanks for coming, and I hope you enjoy it. Now, if you ask me, the name of the game always was, and always will be, defense. Don't you agree? Huh? Oh, absolutely. You got to have a good d. Right. You know, I don't see any reason you fellows can't go all the way to the Rollers Ball this year. HANK: Rollers Ball? Right. Pasadena. Son, how long have you been playing football? Hank, don't you realize that to these guys this is a business, and you know what you are? You are a product. But we're in the same business. They wanna win, that's what I want, that's what I'm gonna do. Oh, you are, are you? Uh-huh. Hm, I guess you're gonna be one of the lucky ones, huh? [LAUGHS] Luck's got nothing to do with it. [CROWD CHEERING] Gathers, get in there for Johnson. All right, Hank, you can do it. ANNOUNCER: We get number 10, Hank Gathers. [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Gathers continues to pace this resurgent USC team, weighing in last night with 16 hard nose points and 12 monstrous rebounds. This Gathers kid, just can't say enough about him. [LAUGHS] Along with side-kick guard, Bo Kimble, these two have literally turned things around for SC. The prospects for next year appear rosy with all five starters returning. This is... Hank "The Bank" Gathers... Maybe not. What do you mean? Coach is leaving. Out of here. History. He quit? He took an administrative position. Oh, yeah. Right. What about Spence? Is he getting the gig? You think he'd take it? He and coach were real tight. Oh, I heard that. The new coach wanted me to convey to you that he's certainly aware the sense of loss you must all feel over the departure of the previous coaching staff. He's also aware, some of you have made statements to the press regarding your displeasure. He understands and appreciates your sense of loyalty. Particularly in the case of assistant coach Spencer. But now, let me say, that is all ancient history now. It's a new day for SC basketball. Time to turn things around. What do you think we've been doing? Think. You're finishing up a losing season. 12 and 16. You placed last in the conference, gentlemen. I expect congratulations. Let me tell you something. We know. Some new goals, some new directions, even this team can win next season. New coach will show you how to do it. You got to let him. Our coach is gone. That's right, son. So, if you expect to play next season, it's time to get with the new program. Okay? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Hey, hold on a second. You two, hang on a second. Couple of things for you here. What's this? Written notification. Bring it back signed by March 15th or you'll forfeit the scholarships. I'm Hank, he's Bo. Oh. Okay, Hank, just have it back by the 15th, okay? Yeah. I told you, Father Dave, the man says he wants us to stay. But then, look how they treated Spense. And if they really don't want us, they not gonna play us. [SIGHS] Oh, God. I just hope we're doing the right thing, Father D. Yeah, we'll check with you. [SIGHS] Hank, I can't stay someplace I'm not wanted. Of course not. 'Cause, you've always been wanted. Every place I've ever been I had to fight to play. For all we know, we'll be riding the bench for the next three years here, Hank. That's no good. We got to go someplace where we know we gonna play. Someplace where the scouts are gonna see us. Where we gonna go? I don't know. [SIGHS] We're just gonna be okay, right? I mean, it's no big deal. It's gonna be okay, right? Right? I didn't say that. All I know is we can't stay. [SIGHS] And then the library's here. Men's' dorm right across here. And Father Dave must be losing it to send us to a place like this. Hank, what's the problem, man. Coming out to California was one thing, Spence. At least we'd heard of USC. What kind of place is this Loyola Marymount? Looks like I'm in Disneyland. And checkout this schedule. Gonzaga, Santa Barbara, Pepperdine. [CHUCKLES] Name me one guy who ever went pro from Gonzaga. We're gonna be lost and forgotten here. Why don't we not be so melodramatic here, all right? How're you gonna be "Lost and forgotten" when nobody's even heard of you in the first place? You two say you wanna play pro-ball, you got the head coach here who coached the Los Angeles Lakers to the NBA championship. And for my money, the way you two play ball here, I don't think you're gonna find a better head coach in college ball today. I guess he told you, didn't he? Yo, Spence. Gonzaga? Didn't Stockton go to Gonzaga? COACH: In this program we try to make the game very simple. Our goal is to put this in there, as quickly, as often as we can. Any question so far? What we're talking about is non-stop, fast-break, running-gun basketball. It's the way a lot of you grew up playing the game. But we're gonna elevate playground style ball, to a science. It's gonna require a commitment on your parts, to become the best condition athletes in college basketball. Come on. Come on. Let's pick it up, guys. Only four miles to go. Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! You're right, Howard. Being the strongest man alive means I've got to be very careful about what I eat. Thank you, Hank Gathers, star forward for the Loyola Marymount basketball Lions. I didn't even know we had a basketball team. Yes, Aaron. It's a big, big basketball school. Yeah, they're crazy for hoops here. AARON: Daddy, you're gonna come home for Christmas? What you think? Of course, I'm coming home for Christmas. ...big bad truck. [LAUGHS] We'll talk about it. You come home and stay, daddy. Uh, I, I think it's time for your bed time, isn't it? Now, you go ahead and be a good boy. Tell your mama I said hi. I love you. I love you. Uh-uh. I love you more. I love you more. [CHUCKLES] Go to bed. Bye, daddy. I love you. Okay, bye. [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] BO: All right, Hank. This is it. What do you think? I think we're playing somebody called Gonzaga. [HORN BLOWS] Tell me, what is the Gonzaga? I don't know, but we played the bigger crowds at Dallas High School. I heard that. There was so few people out there we could've held riflery practice. We got to do this. We got to make this work, and we can be moving again. We got to play so damn well, those scouts are gonna... [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT] [HORN BLOWS] All right? You with me? Let's do it. [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CHEERLEADERS CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] [BURPS] Something strange and unusual is going on over at Loyola Marymount. Loyolians have never been what you might call "a power house" among the college basketball elite. But after 12 games, they're leading the nation in scoring averaging at almost, unbelievable 125 points per game. Their high... Get ready for this, folks. An astronomical 186 for Kimble and Gathers and company. The Lions of LMU are definitely roaring. What'd I tell you. They're over-playing you in the low post. You move to the left, you'll be unstoppable. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: Basket by Gathers. Basket by Gathers. [GRUNTS] HANK: Hey, Bo. Bo? Hey, man. Face it, Bo. That was a stupid ass thing to do. Don't mess with me, Hank. Hey, they never fix these things these days. It's gonna be okay. Hey, man, I don't know that, neither do you. Oh, yes, I do. You're just gonna have to work, Bo. So, you just enjoy laying up here in this bed, 'cause when you're ready, I'm gonna whip that big butt of yours back into line-up. I've never wanted to sit out. And then I've never been injured. [SIGHS] That's why, it'a good thing you got me, Bo. 'Cause working hard just happens to be my particular field of expertise. Come on, we can do this, my man. You're gonna be just fine. Come on, give it up. Looking very good, my man. Looking quick. Looking graceful. Shut up, Hank. Come on. I'll do one-on-one. Yeah, right. No, soon. You'll see. Check this. Yes! You made a free throw. You wanna call a press conference? No, no, no. Did you notice anything unusual? Other than the fact that it went in? Watch again. Yes! Oh! You switched to left-handed. Mm-hm. If the right hand don't get you, the left one will. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Eight, seven, six, five, four... Come on. Come on. Come on. [GROANING] Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. All right! Come on! [CROWD CHEERING] Now, come on, don't rest. Come on, don't rest. Yeah. [CROWD CHEERING] Come on. Come on. Bend over, come on. [CROWD CHEERING] Spence say if I go pro now, before my senior year, I'll be picked somewhere in the middle of first round. That's not lottery, Bank. I know. But after what happened to you, I got to think. It might not be such a bad idea. Sounds like your mind's already made up. I'm just thinking about it. Mama, if I do this you don't have to work so hard, we could pay up all those bills. Oh, Hank, please. Don't do this for me. But, mama, I had a great year. I led the nation scoring and rebounding. We do this now, we're set for life. Or you wait another year, and you can do better. Listen, baby, nobody in my family, nobody in my life has even made it past high school. But you work hard, you can do it. Look, even Father Dave wants you to get this degree. I agree. And if you're worried about getting hurt, we can take an insurance policy out. Or I can go pro now, with a couple of million dollars in the bank. You know what, Hank? You area man now. I have told you what I thought. You do what you think is best, baby. That is not fair, mama. But that's just the way it is, Hank. That's just the way it is. You do what you think is best, okay? Ah! Looking good, Bo. Still, long way to go, man. Uh, come here. Lottery? Huh, Bo. Lottery? Yeah! [GRUNTS] [BLOWS] Lottery. ANNOUNCER: And with Hank Gathers having a great senior year, and Bo Kimble apparently fully recovered from last years knee injury, Loyola Marymount is firing of all cylinders once more, and appears to have every intention of making a run at the NCAA tournament. [WHISTLE BLOWS] [CROWD BOOING] Come on, Hank. We need this, baby. Two. [CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] One more, now. One more. Come on. [CROWD GASPING] Hank. Hank? Apparently you've suffered a severe arrhythmia, Hank. It's a sudden interruption in your heartbeat. You mean, I had a heart attack? It's an episode. But it's not something to be take lightly. We wouldn't want it to happen again. So, what's the deal? Well, uh... Rests. More tests. Uh, we'll have you see some specialists. I'm putting you on medication right away. We're gonna get this thing under control. So, I can still play, right? Well, uh... Not immediately. Uh, you can practice lightly if you feel up to it, but... I wouldn't want you in competition until I know more about what's happened. But assuming positive tests results, regular observations... I think it's a realistic goal. It's good as new, man. Mm-hm. Nah. Tightens up sometimes, but... it's good. You want me to help you stretch it out? Nah. I really don't have to do this anymore. Just became sort of a habit. Is there anything... Is there anything I could do for you? Don't get all sympathetic on me, Bo. [GRUNTS] I can carry my own bag. I'm all right. Okay, ready? BO: Hey, Hank, my fault. Bad pass. No, no. I should have had that. Come on. The feelings that you describe are not at all uncommon. They are familiar side-effects of mediation. It shouldn't last too long. It's already been too long. It's a process, Hank. As we continue to monitor your response, we'll, we'll adjust the medication accordingly. Say what? We've got to see how it goes. Oh! This is funny. I've never been into drinking, or drugs or nothing like that. I just always knew if I took drugs, I couldn't play ball. So, here I am, like somebody's junkie. It's not the same thing, Hank. It feels the same to me. PLAYER: Heads up! Hank. I'll put you in when I think you're ready. You're not ready. That's great. I bust my butt against schools nobody's ever heard of. And now we're playing Oklahoma on national TV, and you're not playing me? Two weeks ago you collapsed on the court. I'm okay. I hope you know what you're doing to me, coach. It's practically NBA week, you know. You're killing my career. It's too soon. I don't think you're ready yet. When? Hank-- No, let me tell you this, I am gonna play against La Salle and St. Joe's when we get to Philly no matter what. I waited four year to play my home town, I am gonna play for my people. Yes, you will... if you're ready. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] One, two, three... ALL: Lions. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, your Loyola Marymount Lions. ED: Even after falling to Oklahoma, and despite the loss of Hank Gathers, there's no stopping the little engine at Loyola Marymount. Bo Kimble and company are soon to be off on a tough road trip, and the help of Hank Gathers could make the difference in that sports. I'm going on record right now, my man. I'm taking my headlines back when we get to Philly. You just get well. Your headlines will take care of themselves. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] RADIO HOST: This is WADW Sports Room, and we are taking calls about tomorrow night's game between St. Joe's and Loyola Marymount. As you know this marks the return of our local hero's Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble. So you tell me... Can the California kids come home and still make it to big bad six? MAN: Oh, yeah... I got good eyes glued with Bo and Hank. And, uh, both those dudes have a lot of heart. You know, as far as Gathers coming back jacked in West Philly, too much sunshine in the West coast. They're gonna get entertained. WOMAN: Listen, I'm a real sports fan , you know. And I'd like to tell you I've been through a lot of... Mama! Oh, baby! Mama. [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh! Oh, my goodness. I'm okay. See, mama. Oh, just shut up. Come here, you big dope. They're gonna kick St. Joe's back if you ask me, then they're gonna drop La Salle like a bad transmission. My dad's gonna dog them. [BOTH HOOTING] Yes. You don't sit still, I'm gonna carve my name on the back of your head. St. Joe's are tough team to beat. But nobody can beat Hank. So he's been saying since he was younger than you. You feeling okay? You can talk to my duly appointed representative. So you okay? I'm gonna have some cards printed up saying, "Thanks for asking." But Hank is just fine, all right? I'm fine. He's crazy to win, that's all. I'm taking this kid down to Crowns, get him a basketball. Yeah. Got you. Got you. Crowns closed down. No. Yeah, you have to go all the way on another side to German town to find a sporting goods place. These crackheads, they don't need basketball. I told you to stay out of here. Don't you know that boy? That boys name is Spec, isn't that, Ray? Uh, I'll be right back. What's up with you, Specs? I heard you was in town. Came to, uh, to welcome you home. That worth something to you? Yo, man. Uh... How 'bout sharing some of that bank with an old friend? You had to know I don't get paid until I go pro. Well, I don't know, man. Looks pretty good for you now. Specs, man, uh... Hank? Put your jacket on. Specs? One, two, three... ALL: Lions! [CROWD CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Bo Kimble us on fire in front of his hometown crowd. But Hank Gathers isn't playing with any of the... same hands. And Gathers is down. Color turnover by Hank Gathers. Right now, you'd have to say he's hurting the team. Nick Jones is taking it right to Gathers. And again Gathers fails to block out his man. Score! Easy lay off. They extend their lead to 11. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Come on, bank, you're all right. Relax. Let the game come to you. ANNOUNCER: Loyola has a chance here to cut into St. Joe's lead. Two shot. ANNOUNCER: But, historically, Hank Gathers has been a horrible free throw shooter. An air ball. [CROWD BOOING] It's okay. Player. ANNOUNCER: And another miss. Hank Gathers missed both free throws. Here comes St. Joe's. He changes almost every possessions. Still, Hank Gathers watches from the bench. [CROWD CHANTING] ANNOUNCER: Five seconds to go. Crunch time, folks. Bo Kimble takes the pass, ...he better hurry. [BUZZER BUZZES] [CROWD CHEERING] Bo Kimble wins the game! With no time left on the clock Loyola wins! Loyola wins the ball game! [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHANTING] Bo! Bo! Bo! It's been a long time since I've seen you feeling sorry for yourself. Come on, Father Dave. You know, it's more than that. Every scout in the league thinks there's something wrong with me. [SCOFFS] Who knows. Maybe there is. What are you talking about? Ever since it happened, it's like my brain and my body are playing two different games. I mean, I can see what I wanna do out there just as clear as day, but I just can't do what I see. All my life, I've been working... for right now. And it's just slipping away. I can feel it. [SOBBING] It's just slipping away from me. I think there's a little more at stake here than making a pro-deal. Come on, Father Dave, it ain't about no deal. It isn't even about the money. If I wanted money, I'd cash that insurance policy they got for me. It's a million dollars, right? All I have to do is give up playing basketball. This is what it's about, Father Dave. I just want to do... what I always knew I could do. You know? I just wanna play the best I can. I just don't know. I'm scared, you know? [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] [SNIFFLES] [SIREN WAILING] Hank. Oh, baby, you sure everybody knows how to get here after the game? I think so, mama. Okay. Well, come here, baby, won't you help me move the sofa. Uh, mama, you sure that's okay for me? [LAUGHING] Boy, don't you be playing with me when I'm worrying about you. Mama, how many times have I told you? I am the strongest man alive. Hey, put that down and stop it. Besides, I got a built in warranty. You. Look, Hank. People loved you before you ever touched basketball, and will still love you if you never play again. College, pro, never give will be just fine with me. But, mama, it won't be fine with me. Besides, everything is gonna be all right. You'll see. Tonight is my night. Yeah, sure. Oh, what is that? What? Ah! Stop. Get off. No. no. no. [LAUGHING] Go practice, boy. Stop it. Get out of here. Bye. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm out of here. [DOOR CLOSES] ANNOUNCER: Loyola ball. Gathers in the long post. A nifty pass to players, it's gone. Beautiful. Yes! Take it to him. Take it to him. [CROWD CHEERING] Alley-oop and La Salle got it scored. Get back! Get back! Kimble goes back door, and Hank Gathers slams. Hey, Father, what the hell is wrong with him? I want some of that. [CHUCKLES] Sorry, ma. Go, Hank! [CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Loyola with the ball, score is tied, six seconds to go. Gathers in position, but it's foul. [WHISTLE BLOWS] ANNOUNCER: Loyola can grab it up from free throws from Gathers. We saw last night, Gathers is a poor foul shooter. Well, have a little faith, Father. Okay now. One-on-one now. Play the match, one-on-one. ANNOUNCER: Nothing wrong with that one. Gathers puts Loyola up by one. One more now. Play it. Yeah! ANNOUNCER: Loyola up by two points. [BUZZER BUZZES] [CROWD CHEERING] We take the final four. Final four. I say we take the whole tournament. [LAUGHS] And then lottery selection. And then... BOTH: Rookie of the Year. Yes. Yes. Somebody call my name? Liar. Get out of here. He used to sweep off the snow in the winters. And in the summer time he'd hot-wire the lights, anything to get on the courts. He even swiped my keys a couple of times... BOTH: To get into the gym. So any idea where you might end up playing? I don't know, Charlotte, Cleveland. Orlando, maybe. Orlando. I'll play where ever they send me. I heard that. I heard that. Hank. Could I live in Philadelphia? It's not where you live. And who else lives in Philadelphia? Hey, hey, don't clock me. Leave my son alone. Leave my son alone. Don't clock, yo... You better, you better hold me back. But the best part for me were the free throws. Oh, yeah. Finally. But it was all great. I owe it all to you, Father. Every last bit. Get out of here. I'm really proud of you, Hank. You know, Father Dave, you've always been my hero. [HORN TOOTING] I'm coming. I got to go. Okay. Look, uh... Derricks been talking about us flying out for the regional finals, I mean, if you're still in the tournament. Well, we gonna make it to the finals, mama. So, you tell that buddy go ahead and buy those tickets. Non-refundable. Come here, honey. Look you be good, okay? And you take care of yourself. I will, mama. You hear me? I will. I have to go. Okay. All right. Take care of yourself. I will. I love you. I love you too, baby. Tell Derrick to buy those tickets, mama. I love you. HANK: I love you more. [DOOR CLOSES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] And since Hank Gathers returned the line-up, the little engine you call Loyola is ready and willing, if not perhaps 100% able, to make a run for the national title. But first they have to prove themselves in regional action. And tonight's semifinal game versus Portland should be an important test for the Lions, both physically and psychologically. Take it easy out there tonight, Bank. Why? So you can get all the headlines to yourself again? No, that's not it. I'm worried about you. Maybe I'm the only one who see it, but you're still not right. You're still not playing the way you used to. [SCOFFS] What do you know, Bo? You're just another ignorant basketball player. Then, it's perfect, 'cause that's just who I am talking to. It's like when I tore up my knee. This stuff happens, dude. Even to lucky guys like you and me. Yeah, I heard that. Be careful out there tonight, Bank. [SIGHS] To get where we are from where we came, how much luck do you think we were owed? [LAUGHING] You know, Bo? I think that's the most words I've ever heard you say at one time. [LAUGHS] Love you, man. Thank you. [SNIFFLES] [GRUNTS] Put me down, Hank. Come on, man. Let's go. [CROWD CHEERING] [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [EXCLAIMS] Hank. [MAMA SCREAMING] Sweet Jesus, no! [CRYING] [CRYING] Father Dave, Hank's gone. Mama... [CRYING] Mama. [CLEARS THROAT] [SNIFFLES] Everytime, I pick up a basketball... for the rest of my life... [CRYING] Hank Gathers will be with me. Every jump shot... [CRYING] every three pointer... Hank is now part of me. Hank, was very happy when he left. Very happy. Hank would not have chosen any other way, then the way he left us. On the basketball court. I also know, Hank you like to hear one more cheer from his fans, friends, people who supported him. One last applause in his house. [CROWD CLAPPING] [CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING] Love you, man. Thank you.
