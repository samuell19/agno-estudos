(Applause) now the Ashton prize for ecological biology to richard hard fits an informer I got the right name yes where is he mr. Forbush mr. Forbush mr. Forbush I heard you sweetheart let's go for good morning sir good morning they're still here I take it you've met her Hut yes he was smuggled a short and adora got a leak yes. You've given her breakfast? she begins with all bran and prune sir start the day with all brand improves and you start the day right that's what my mom always it mm-hmm very moving bring the uncovered wagon around to Fanny's at lunar hood dropping in there for a revival meeting die what you even gonna have a cup of tea with me another time sweetheart I like to give my darling how are you thank you a large whiskey in a copy the mr. Forbush knock alright he has to be new that's Mitchell know her she'd have a queen soon as you student hmm that's right oh you're getting everywhere they're not protesting they're madly pulling spines all over choppers they're not have to pay our way you wouldn't know you've never had to do you want the whiskey separately oh it's a scotch coffee as opposed to work now there's well for you you also speak fluent biology that's right the coffee first then a scotch after that cream so you're Queens that's right me too postgraduate because would you not prefer to see so tonight just die I prefer to concentrate on my humble stance undergraduate of course there's a film at the Forum tonight about a giant clam about the size of the Isle of Wight sucks passengers from passing steamers it's very scientific don't think my biology is quite up to that here look I'm finishing the end of the term we may not be able to see much of each other well that's a cross I shall just have to bear shot down sugar how long do speak oh not at all indeed not you see I'm off of the upper reaches of the Amazon very shortly to study back life particularly the blood sucking vampire witches every schoolgirl I was eight pounds in those pants well it could be the last great adventure leaving soon perhaps well at the moment it's the rainy season but I should be there in month or two look neglect the others concentrate on me Tomas actually have to work under be a bluestocking what was in the middle of the wet season hey man ah how long you say you stay one minute one minute indeed I probably you say that 45 minutes ago man yes but they're not Stephan very nasty woman indeed man with a green and yellow melancholy should be drinking shot rose he sat like patience on a monument come on that was shot it's after three o'clock was not this love indeed you've got a one-off model there fanny oh never mind I expect you'll come round hope for the best prepare for the worst above all keep cheerful put in a word I love I'm in the Good Food Guide now not the latest directory oh come on Dicky just kiss straight home Tara what will you put the lock on the door for me see you tonight bye bye taxi lady hey man now you wanna talk with the other line oh no indeed I'm moving but you're not no this is a racial discrimination indeed a matter for the race relations for your chariot awaits man thank you good morning hi thanks for the ride your teas jeredy come back how did those keys go well I'm just sit there with the city ground here oh yes indeed sir you stopped on a pedestrian crossing sir yes I can see that but you have come serving in the pedestrian crossing regulations of 1954 why is it you could she look at well because my keys have gone stop asking these doubtful questions just one minute sir officer you are holding me up you are obstructing the traffic have you been drinking - drinking it stupid question I never touch the stuff I'd like to come along with me and take a breathalyzer test if you want you very nasty very nasty woman indeed all right Jones I sorry right sir I tell you this is a complete nutter wasting time that's right sir just blow in the back the ten seconds really please it 35 okay oh thank you sir Kostas bail seems to be going up with the cost of living not really sure it goes up with the frequency of the offense something like a receipt over this will you please write good morning ah terribly kind of you to fly together I cannot help but agree with you it is extremely kind of me he's also in Thalia character there are seven your receipt ah Thank You sergeant however you should thank the college computer for it not me I did not be into the fact that its selection for the 2:30 in Newmarket came out of alpha plus you would have stayed in the Nick turn up to the computer he's my Colin would you like to share a taxi yes I will share a taxi I will also accept your check thanks for the hospitality I was of course young one Smurfs no I suspected it sir shall I make it out to cash and I can well understand from a hazy recollection Lee urged cohabit with every girl student in sight but what's the dead embodied but it means very little time to pursue anything else your trouble is far too much money then thank and no parental control but it so happens that the one object of my worship is tilt mine - sir is you divide academic talent you know very well what I'm talking about and it's rare to find anybody with your upbringing with so much I you miss me yes you did say that if x squared in Parliament Square please far side or bush we cannot stop the taxi of life at will and no sir we must pay the fare oh don't worry about that sorry dis wish I could do something in return you can't Oh tomorrow afternoon professor tricking is giving a lecture on the Antarctic or something do nine ears of course it's a bit of a fanatic isn't it Tringham is an old friend of mine and I should like to see him well supported and I'm to be one of the prongs thank you you're very far from being my favorite student Forbush very far you are an exhibitionist of the first water with all the tasks that go with it but you happen to be potentially an outstanding biologist now remember this for Bush sex and scotch in either order do not apply olive trees to make professor Tringham tomorrow afternoon don't forget hi sport stir huh DuPont rope you into do you realize we should be in there give us time to work up a good first I'll see you later see there they are then after traveling for weeks across sea and snow and ice back in the Rookery back on the same nest as last year then comes what are you that pole the villain of the piece the great skewer cataract our skewer note the strongly hooked beak the length of body over two feet 20 full e formed with a wingspan of nearly 5 feet they're solitary birds outside the breeding season preying on other seabirds harrassing them forcing them to disgorge their catch though accomplished fliers they swim badly and dive with difficulty study him closely because in the lifecycle of the penguin that was absent during the period when the eggs are being incubated even as the young penguin chicks lunch their way out of the shellfish seen and heard for the first time in a condition of total dependence it's then that the skewer bird plays a part that seemed so happy hello tyre my love I very sorry I had to leave you so abruptly yesterday but he's been really out of us stupid man you must tell my father he happens to be one in time maybe I come to love him too Shh came to listen to the lecturer forget about the frozen myself I'll soon be in the sweltering humidity of the lower reaches of the white nile that's two and a half thousand miles of cannibals and crocodiles are waterfalls waterhole Stevens and Paul I don't let her study the crocodile in his natural habitat top the upper reaches of the Amazon this morning you are going to study blood-sucking vampires they've all been signed up for horror film the crocodile but it could be the last great adventure could be planned for you why don't you go down and make it and fend off all intruders but there's one particularly striking point I'd like you to remember not all the skewers live of penguins just a few of them operate a kind of avian protection racket and say in effect the Penguins will keep the other skewers off in return for a fair percentage of your eggs and chicks this ensures the survival of a sufficient number of penguin chicks after all that rubbish how about a drink ah poor Bush you were you attended the lecture then yes oh good then undoubtedly you could do with a cup of tea what are your intentions for the future for Bush that is always assuming they don't send you to jail well insofar as I thought about it at all I rather inclined towards becoming part of the brain drain to the state mm-hmm I'm sorry to hear that well I don't fancy staying here on 750 pounds per annum rising by annual increments of 10 pounds till I earn 1,200 or whatever it is mmm but your aunt left you some managing here my grandmother well then you owe it to science to take on some important if poorly paid project some sort of field well man anything in mind professor hmm ready for consideration let's think you just pick something out of the air well for example the New Zealand government Department of scientific was airship asked us to recommend a candidate for the job making a detailed population study of the Adelie penguin rookery at Cape Royds in the Antarctic I see penguins and I thought you were a simple straightforward absent-minded Oh professor you know as research goes this is something of a plum we've already had over 60 Africa I didn't know there were that many penguin fanciers it's the call of the Antarctic with all its variant associations shackled stopped great white son I surprised you couldn't make it the White Nile or the other reaches of the answer I don't grandfather never mind professor it'll be quite alone living in Shackleton's old hat the one he built her on the expedition of 1907 aren't you always saying adventure is what modern man means yes but I hadn't brass monkey latitudes in mind how does one get to kick lawyers I rather think one flies to McMurdo Sound and from there on it's Huskies and helicopter helicopters musket mmm he wouldn't miss your driving license now wouldn't the New Zealanders sooner have a fellow with an unblemished record not necessarily as a matter of fact I've already strongly recommended you for the job but of course the the final decision must rest you I'd like to oblige professor but I'm simply not the sub-zero type I'm very sorry hello darling George coughing nice tire much enough to tear over there traitor hello sporty you get to join you why not just leave him as a matter of fact you bought kept me he's just handed me research plum of the year no kidding yeah so it looks like goodbye for the last time before I take off to tread in the footsteps of Scott Shackleton if it after you beat up the answer down the Nile well I decided to give the Antarctic priority Antarctic that's right it'll be the first attempt to discover the causes of the instability of the penguin population at Cape Royds is that why you went to trims lecture just think of it alone quite alone six months in the great white silence definitely accepted it then what no intention of going anywhere near the South Pole unlike star star sure what's this Oh for me a like I'm all if you program down there dick knee in the Antarctic they only be a couple of hundred miles away from you that's nothing these days by hot ski by husky um I drop over come Christmas time they don't believe it of course you bet just because stars deafened everyone great white sad don't forget our date tomorrow night star I hear there's a good film at for me but a giant ball Fanny no I shan't forget you for this - shot you know you're only being brave fighting back the tears i hollow laughter I know you don't want to break down in public let me take you home and you can go to pieces in my hands explorers goodbye why don't you go in back to get yeah I want to show you my new set of ignition keys this you think I'm a pusher but don't you ran word one smile and the Sydney little thing is going to be flat on her back well it takes more than a gust of wind to do that widget for Bush and that's where you are wind empty we a whiskey our house yes a large one very nice very nice indeed sir putting it on the table sir hello class pic' - professor - what this yes it's very important so let me say mr. Forbush without further preamble about a new consideration of your scientific attainments capital cause from what we heard about you for mr. du port we consider you to be the most fitting applicant we've interviewed well they have a lot to offer you the past thank you will be set down at Cape Royds by US Navy helicopter on the 16th of October the 16th of October um let me see Thanksgiving Day Canada Columbus Day Oh the 19th Sunday after Trinity do you attach some special importance to that fact mr. Forbush no sir absolutely not you should endeavor to have all your biological equipment on field stores sufficient to support yourself and your research for a period of up to five months ready for that date the Antarctic sir you sir what the hell am I to take very quick I can't live on bully beef or biscuits for six but not you Sam let's think now be the Antarctic ah what study that's warming anymore India I mean Larry Todd well you wouldn't expect them to suggest I was clean sir would you not for where you're going I suppose not and it's what you've done for 2,000 tins of Malaysian curry made your van freeze Bengal chutney you will need papadums and of course some some Bombay duck now not for variety how I got breasts of quail in wine jelly most nutritious earth will there change tool doesn't wrists by the way so where will you be staying in Shackleton's old heart Rhianna sir how interesting I seem to remember hearing reproduce and ethics but this as well with breast quail in wine jelly eaten legend Thursday sir then it tasted too I believe see what next oh yes would you come over here son yeah I put you down for a few John's about this muga caviar yes your may indeed thank you thank you very much it should keep beautifully and at all that ice oh do stop clicking your tongue Richard how's the physics these days biology what oh yes before I have been doing postgraduate research for two years now in the lungs and ear it's possibly long enough for both of you to be aware of that you might like to know that I am flying to the Antarctic in a few days time or bed work to observe a colony of penguins well why not observe them in the zoo here sir not quite the same thing as it happens well do be sure to wrap up probably don't know what those places are like I shall be gone for six months it's going to be tough well you're mr. worth of the one day here that's something answer that funny when you darling and if it's the butcher I only want two lamb cutlets hello Oh congratulations else for either somebody here would like to talk to you Tyra you're killing this I am you really mean I do all right yes unfortunately but I suppose I owe you an apology then any person I cannot view an incentive I shall be a long time away I can rock it humble pie isn't really your dish I went there today No if you like I'll be there no it didn't order the lamb cutlets Richard don't stop out too late the night you know your mother can never sleep until you get in father I shan't be back tonight if you recall I haven't actually lived here for the last two years I live in a flat in London mm-hmm quite right - what are they saying man is tired of London is tired of life okay I think they're waiting to expect you Berry's birthday he's my nephew then my next and final trick but a bit of disappearing without please come along excuse us he looks like Santa mate is not hasn't got the proper helmet can't go yet but without your award right you wanna come in here yeah children around I'm sure honey come on turn your back I said turn your back there Christopher patron saint of all travelers I understand he's still reasonably effective even if he has been demoted I understand exactly how he feels never thought you've really go cut major you oh yeah my house could get me to the frozen edge of the world to be alone with a lot of birds and tuxedos not your ego you well I don't seem to have organized myself too well do I I meet you one day and leave you the next that's a grim prospect all that ice I don't kind of hunger to get back in one piece here we'll of course you will I feel rather like poor captain Oates you remember what he said when he walked into the blizzard to die I'm just going outside and maybe some time is that anyone at home captain Scott sir I wonder if I ruptured myself they pull me out of this hellhole but they merely fly me out of trust according to previous abloom is the first penguin thrive on the 18th or 19th October there apparently as regular as clockwork so down it final the record exactly when they arrived at the clock interval it's not raining hello that is ed Lyr Cape Royds calling zlq Scott fais how do you read me over ringing you're fine mr. Forbush only part is over I know what / - bushy you don't have to shout ha sorry / settle in yet just like home there are certain primordial differences but you're missing your electric blanket that is the least of my regrets as far as bed is concerned at the penguin shown up yet no not a sign of them well perhaps they won't turn up this year as they decided to spend the summer on Miami Beach instead don't worry they'll be there very messages I haven't thought about it yes all right one fine shoot it's to miss taro Luke 16 Oh Church Street London sw3 yeah what's a message here it's Christmas every day sign captain Scott okay anything else no thank you don't do anything I wouldn't do oh it has to be joking well Tyra here aya Milo in the middle of the frozen wastes without even the number 11 bus in sight nothing but claret white Burgundy foie gras tin noise and of course Krug 61 sustained me against the ferocity of the elements oh here I said waiting for the first penguins and I Scott there's a mascot base this is Error why are Cape Royds coatings nlq Scott bears how do you read me over Hugh Scarface I'm reading your Marik creep or sheep how you get enough I'm not at the point it's not a ghost of a penguin have you hadn't report on the Icebreaker not really there was a fight in from Christchurch couple of hours ago they said it was clearing off of both thanks Alex I suppose that something any message with the bird no not today okay take care well if they're so strapped to the light force that they have to find their way back here to this refrigerated graveyard every year that's their bad luck god I wish they'd get here and get it over last you all wherever you are most revered and welcomed bird I greet you well I bid you are welcome to the kingdom of 4motion the perfect place for a honeymoon thirty two three four yes 1334 pick on me 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 you you you I want to congratulate you you are mm spank him to arrive on these shores this wins you a 2 ounce can of hickory-smoked floater paste take it take it take take it I promise you put it on toast is delicious right there now that we are all present and correct I want you to know that I consider you to be as fine a body of penguins as I never had the pleasure to review because I've always thought to the smart penguin here's an efficient penguin now I want you to look at me not even is your commander that has your father they don't always come true and it's got your problems with it as it were penguin first so then the order of the day is be fruitful and multiply and the book of bedtime is loving a cold climate hey you two wait for it my new neighbors are settling in very nicely Terra he's having a reckless fashion mum has found her way back to exactly the same heap of stones she nested on last year well dad rushes around repairing with the lapidation z' of the winter single-bird usually mail had strict skywards flippers moving slowly known as the ecstatic display for the benefit of unattached female looks or is it the Mitchell display yeah right first time you've got to be hitched to mutual display penguins aren't so different from humans they have the same problems of living space same squabbles across the garden wall and when some Joker tries to put another bird there's the same yes I knew you'd have to show some time I admire these birds more every day the sheer guts in tenacity their daily penguin takes some beating as for me I feel well enough you may not believe it Turner but I think about you a lot sometimes I forget what you look like I shut my eyes I try to thank you back to me suddenly I can see you again and I think what the hell are you doing down here alone at the cold end of the world easy lap times already cut tabs on you lot I know most of your pretty face huh same nest and same mate every year there are some of you don't play the game you will also kill and dissect a certain number of penguins with particular reference to blood supply to the moon's thickness of blubber layers and the condition of the reproductive organs and to judge by the color of these stains I'd say you'd used up most of your food reserves so easy easy merit come on little penguin I have to know what these blubber reserves are sorry Oh still find out so what's changed what's the difference hey nice could you write a couple of letters for you here and then there from a deep frozen lava thank you to Ian Julian come on hi there I brought some ale yeah you're from the enterprise out in the sound they told us that Scott you were out there we thought we'd come up and have a look-see well there's not much to see now is that where they all go away I guess they didn't like the chopper too much that's a fairly shrewd guess how do you know I know that it's unimaginably difficult for the Penguins to walk God knows how many miles over the sea and ice on three-inch legs then spend forty days starving well they caught a ride build their nests copulate and incubate the eggs before they can get back to the sea and break their fast I also know that what makes it incredibly more difficult for them is to be blown out of their nests by a bloody helicopter see fella we're sorry me too I've been waiting a long time for these birds he wouldn't understand what at all sure that I do come up to the hut for a drink yes Cheers uh would you chance man hanging on a bit I just want to finish a letter and I'd be obliged if you take it with you oh sure no problem wretched Birds means scattered over this benighted landscape right it's a black pepper I've used up so much courage already they'll be able to find enough to come back I'm afraid you were drop these and the mailbox the Scott base for please I will do better than that we'll send it from the carrier thank you more ginger beer uh no I guess not we'd better be moving otherwise our engine will be surprised thanks all the same oh and sorry about the Penguins yeah alright films no no never forget it so all thanks for the drink Ksenia I know and thanks for the mail our pleasure bye jeez that kids in a bad way did you see all that was bottled they call up Scott fais what could they do why in a psychiatrist fucking kite to be Oh in revenues in context find in the heart able to write at last penny had to go back home I was on my own all Saturday and Sunday is there any place quite as lonely as London at weekends we had a party on Monday so of course the fridge had to pack up imagine it a party and no ice anywhere Marvis thought do you know Julian Doughty I'm going out with him next Thursday he's something in a merchant bank which at least has the novel advantage that he has to bath regularly so much for the garetty's of the capital I hope some Christopher's doing his stuff now you've proved your point can't you turn round and come back again then we might get to know each other I agree Tara the girl you left behind you well chaps here ever so humble there's no place like home now we're getting somewhere first a very fast egg well Tara all the eggs are Lehane and now the hen penguins are off to the sea to recover and to catch food for their chicks they'll be away for two or three weeks so now it's the old man's turn to sit on the eggs nothing to eat and nothing to do except watch and wait life is never easy for them Tara no sooner were they and a left appeared so they came again we can skin and devour a penguin with one movement of his powerful art but not this time and later off the girls went for a rest their first square meal in weeks well so far I've counted fifteen hundred and sixty seven eggs it's not bad for an on battery system is it forgive me if I'm becoming a bit of a drag but every day I seem to be getting more and more involved with these odd little characters well once more the old sleeping progress box so good night terrible I'll be back to you in the morning how are you ready yes coming we're late sweetie the curtain goes up a date ready sorry to keep you waiting Tara the skewers when I woke up this morning they were already attacking the exes we're going to be late I hate you bloody skewers I could be so good without you forget it What did he say you're here to observe nature want to reorganize it no job for a man is it incubating eggs still lose any more weight I'll make you a photographic model stand down the men and the girls are back I know I know don't blame the old man he did his best yeah get your heads down hold your ground but the best there to help you stop face falling better ly our Cape Royds come in breeze over said lq scott base calling z ly our Cape Royds I say again come in Reese over I okay bushy how do you read me over come in please that our wire come in please over there help you stop base calling been a while take boy to you all hey bushy come in please over say again dead elk you Scarface calling Zetas lyr Cape Royds are you there bushy are you there how do you read me Russia yeah yeah yeah this is Noi are kept roads calling xatoku Scarface or we're speaking over I don't K bushy we will lied about you we got a peak gust 130 knots here it must be much tougher where you were is there anything you need oh I'm fine ah I could do with some surgical bandages and some burn dressings sometime okay see when I can fix up everybody else now no I don't think so huh well it's got low you still around right look after yourself I'll do my best over not how'd you get yeah I just happened to be passing sport how would you get here I got a mule train outside cheese whatever happened to you boy you look rough hey touch of wind plays havoc with the Constitution one thing hasn't changed around here you always were a snappy dresser one thing I haven't missed out here is a stand-up comic now tell me it's Scott you're needed some burn dressing so I brought them along see if I get mr. Forbush to prepare you an up and dressed one star if you let any of those dogs loose I'll cut it throat I swear it calm down sport all right all right you know what those dogs are like they're killers what don't worry about them what's the matter with you anyway oh sorry I spoke they're just another trick rich yes to my lads up where no matter hard time up with the lizard and the skewers and everything penguin foods easy defenseless touch just right for those bunch of birds look do you think you do you see what he's got there oh they've had 300 of them already they're just creatures do like any other they have to live who needs them I could wring that blasted necks feed the necks filming prussic acid happy Christmas what yes happy birthday Jesus Christmas star come on your hair looks like it had quite a party the blizzard blew the window in I'm sorry I'm having the time or the energy to do anything about it no matter of fact I don't feel too great at the moment what my grandmother would have called poorly that hand looks bad give it here capture the frostbite it should be all right like a good nurse Oh Stone the crows fault that must've been one hell of a blow sure was bluey that's hard sitting at home nights waiting for you what do you think I'll bet does she keep a light burning in our bedroom window what for everyone knows where it is I expect you think so then I'll space for I brought you a letter from her really really you really are a fan of war lovely Merry Christmas sport here you are all penguins are Merry Christmas just the job your Christmas stocking no good let's see what our company you can ever do the Thoreau bit I'll walk bid Cathy went and lived alone I don't think he thought it worked out either did you read your letter yet yes honey girl sir you mean you didn't get your outs before you came out here come well did you did you know as a matter of fact I got a medal instead more exceptional bravery in the face of the enemy what else well how do you manage stir the birds I mean how they don't bother me sport I'm a practical sort of a bloke myself you know sure come on then what'll it be the only money in our sport like anology calls nine months you'll be home yourself in a couple when the outside entire months is a long time soon passes if you're not thinking about something else you know you're a thick skin sort of a fellow star huh what's wrong with that at least I know what's real and can stay objective meaning I don't don't take the birds too seriously especially not these birds save it after Tora Orpheus it's been great having you here tarah so far they've massacred nearly 500 of the original fifteen hundred and sixty-seven chicks God knows how few will survive to swim away if only I brought a gun with me but stop it I must so now I plan to build a machine that will destroy them skewer headquarters sure trebuchet is near my fine-feathered friend I'd no mistake about that what happened to me have I gone mad or something even I couldn't wipe them all out next month next year the skewer say in the Penguins will keep the other skewers off in return for a fair share of your eggs and chicks in this way nature ensures the survival of a sufficient number of penguin chicks a Providence not to be despised by the thinking scientists so in the end the Penguins won through with the usual heavy casualty but the usual number of survivors the skewers have a place in the system to baga nothing else yes there is a patent error funny isn't it the one unselfish and completely disinterested act of my life was when I tried to change it I fail you well of course and I deserve to who was I to take it on myself to put the balance right last chap of the world if you ask me I'll have an olive after all our tribe Tara has exterminated so many marvelous creatures for no better reason than to clothe our women and line our pockets of supply and demand oh man doesn't seem to understand economics at all does it neither do i sir will you please another thing what happens when we've finished destroying the patent and only the human race is left to inherit this poison planet just tell me that Tara he's asking us I said shut up you ask me he's been alone far too long I think you'd better go Arno look sweetie after over any Goti penguins take your burner hat and umbrella and get out but I haven't got a better hat and umbrella as far as I'm concerned you've always had a spiritual bloody bowler hat and umbrella so take them and go your jobs Evelyn bushy leaving us any moment they tell me well it's been good to have you around said goodbye to penguins yet well they'll be back again next year struggling over the same barren stretch of ice to breed the next generation and so it'll go on as long as there are penguins and skewers and the will to survive and what have I learned from it all that every living creature depends in some way on every other. Humans too. - I'm not the same - myself anymore Tara well I seen the sand to you and you to me (Dramatic Music)
