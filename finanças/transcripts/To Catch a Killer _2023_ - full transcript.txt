The countdown to the New Year is on. Fire up those grills and ice the Cristal, 'cause it is time to party this year out the door and welcome the new one right in. I'm really excited. I think it's gonna be a really good year. Of course, there's gonna be one big party downtown as fireworks light up the night sky over the Inner Harbor. And safety, once again, it's a top priority. All across the country, police departments... Coming after the stroke of midnight, we have quite a party in store. It's a relative calm before the storm. I want to show you what it looks like behind me. We've tested the confetti. We've tested the fireworks. Believe me, you're not just gonna see them. You're gonna feel them... In your chest.

She's the problem. Okay? This woman is distressing my customers, and she's refusing to leave. Hey, that's it. You're done. Let's go. Don't touch me, you little shit. - You hear that? - Hey, dude. You're the one distressing the customers. The lady paid for her meal. She's entitled to finish it. It's New Year's, man. Yeah, I know it's New Year's. I'm working here, buddy. Great. Ma'am, you can't bring alcohol in here. Try eating this food without it. Thank you. Look, she clearly has a problem. Why don't you let her just finish and leave? Because she has been here for three goddamn hours, okay? Hey, listen, I'm not trying to be an asshole, but I need that table. - Really? - Yeah, really.

Whoever's inside had a copy of the key. We're holding the residents in base camp. At least the ones we managed to hold on to. My first responders got the others on tape. Good thinking. What about searching the condos? I could bring federal warrants. I heard. Seventeen flights and no gas mask? You're wasting precious medical time here, Falco. In the middle of a citywide medical emergency. It won't happen again, sir. Forget about the warrants. We'll just ask permission. Anyone gets antsy, they're the ones we want. All right, people, listen up. We're being joined by Special Agent Lammark from the Bureau's regional field office. The FBI is gonna be assisting us with this investigation. Thank you. Okay, within the next few hours, your desks are gonna be flooded with data, much of it inevitably false. You're also gonna hear a lot of opinions. But opinions never caught anyone, so it's important to keep certain preconceptions in mind while classifying evidence. One: "Mass murderers want to get caught." Well, this one doesn't. Twenty-nine victims. Every shot found its mark. No casings, no brass. Not a single stray hair or fingerprint. This guy is thorough. He didn't come here to die, and he does not want to be found. We're gonna disappoint him. Two: You will hear this man called a terrorist. But any terrorist organization that could've pulled that off... They would rush to claim credit for it. So far, none have. Three: You will hear this man called a maniac. Shit, I agree. Except the range of personality disorders is so extensive that it includes all of us here. Depression, anxiety, uh, schizophrenia. But... PPD, NPD, PTSD. We took every crazy off the street, there would be no one left to police them. So... to succeed, we're gonna have to keep our minds open. Don't start out picturing a racist or a Nazi. He's not a type. He's a person. Somebody loved him. Somebody trained him. Somebody sold him that gun. We find them... we find our guy. Four... The governor's given you all the resources he can give you. There's nothing more I can do. I'm a federal agent. - Highways are not federal. I'm sorry. - Ah. Shutting them down would only cause mass panic. No, the shooter causes mass panic. Shutting down a highway causes headaches. Headaches my governor doesn't need right now. In shock, the mayor has called for calm. If you see anyone suspicious... "It's not a type. It's a person." What a hack. No wonder they kicked him out of D.C. These people, they're just born plain evil. Evil is cutting off a bird's wing just to see what happens. This guy is swatting mosquitoes. Whatever. We should string him up by his balls from the top of a flagpole. That'll deter all the other nutsos out there. Officer. Why don't you leave the sentencing to the judge. Our job right now is to catch him. - Sorry, sir. - Oh, it's okay. Nice to know how I'll be remembered. Any chance of some fresh coffee? This tastes like transmission fluid. Right away. Mm, I'll do it. It's okay. Excuse me. Why'd you say that thing about mosquitoes? - Oh, it was just a feeling. - Based on what? I don't think this guy is looking for destruction. I think he's looking for relief. And do you have a feeling that he's gonna do it again? Yes. Why? Because he liked it. How do you know? He killed 29 people. Otherwise, he would've stopped at two. Well, why did he stop shooting at all? I mean, why not kill 50? 60? Was it because the fireworks stopped and so there was no more cover for the gunshots? - Yeah, maybe. - Bullshit. Don't patronize me. Tell me what you think. I think he got his fill. No matter how good the food tastes, you stop eating when you've had enough. Till you get hungry again. What's your name? Eleanor Falco, sir. Lammark. The number of deaths by firearms in this... Maybe because we leveled Iraq on a lie? There's no Second Amendment in China. Now you're justifying mass murder?

Pseudocommandos are terrorists without a known cause. They become obsessed with weapons and regalia to make up for their own sense of impotence and failure.

Meet him at Lindenblatt's at 6:00. He wants to see you. Didn't say why. Fuck. We are exposing more people to more risk. It's out of the question. You can forget about it. Jesse, haven't you seen "Jaws"? Right now, you're the asshole that's trying to keep the beach open. Twenty-nine bodies. Well, they had 58 in Vegas. Next day, you had Celine Dion... She's onstage, Caesars Palace. - The show's got to go on. - Hello. That guy was dead. We have an Olympic-class marksman running wild. The governor is not closing hospitals, - is not closing down schools. - Fine. Of course. Those we can deal with, but theme parks, malls, stadiums? Yeah, well, we're not gonna impose a curfew without a single clue. What's the strategy? "Until Lammark finds him"? By now, the guy could be in Minnesota. - They're not closing Minnesota. - Oh. 9/11, New York City... They didn't shut it down. Look, if you can't deliver what you promised without shutting down the whole damn city, - forget about it. - Jesse. Calm down. I can find him. What I need to know is that you're onside. I got to go. Mayor was still mayor in the sequel. That's the lesson from "Jaws." Let's revert later today. I don't even know what that means. Jesus fuck. Sir. Um... is this a good time? No, please. Please, go ahead. These fucking people. It's almost as though they designed a system specifically to drain my energy away. I don't get it. Don't they want you to catch him? Oh, yeah. By yesterday. The problem is that they think they know how. Anyway, let's talk about you. Coffee? Sure. I can think of two reasons why you might be getting a good read on this guy. One: You're potentially a good detective. Two: You're as fucked-up in the head as he is. Either way, I'm doing everyone a favor by keeping you off the streets. Oh. - Hey. - Hi. Look at you, buddy. What's got you so slim? Cut out gluten. It's a magic bullet. - That gluten, huh? - Yeah. - Steak and eggs got gluten? - No. I believe you've met Jack McKenzie? As an investigator, frankly, he's average at best. But when we get close to that killer, trust me, we all want Mac around. Flattered. She staying? I'd have to ask for your transfer. I'd be working for the Bureau? No, you'd be a liaison between BPD and me, basically, making sure that I get the information I need when I need it. I'm surrounded by jackals and clowns. Krupp and Marquand are capable, but they're gonna feed everything back to D.C. I just need people around me that are smart and that I can trust. Right now, believe it or not, that's you two. So don't fuck it up. Be an artist, not a cop. Use your intuition. This guy's on a spiral of destruction. I expect you to slide down after him. I'm here to catch you. You know that. You stay away from this girl. Thank you, sir, but I can protect myself. Oh, I'm worried about him. Okay, people. Let's go catch him. The block has 12 security cameras, but the drive overwrites every 72 hours. Our guy got in before that, we missed him. There are also significant blind spots, including the service bay and the second-floor hallway window. Now, Samantha's collating all the incident AV: cell phones, drone surveillance. It's about 300 hours of footage. We should have it cleaned up and cut down in sequence by 1:00 p.m. Can I see a rough cut at 11:00? Mckenzie: Absolutely. The Realtor's checking through all of the walk-throughs over the last six months. He and his team will be available for questioning first thing tomorrow morning. Okay, painters, locksmith, phone company. - Come on. - No landline, no cable, no Wi-Fi. No one lived there. The owner had the place painted before the pandemic. We found the company. We're tracing the men. Um, Eleanor? Uh, you-you're gonna get copies of all these reports, okay? Yeah, all right. Um... please. Mckenzie: Señor Ortega has been a janitor at this building since it opened. He's 54, Cuban, GPR negative. There's no guns, no record. He claims he's never had a copy - of the keys. - Right. Mckenzie: There's another janitor named Barraza, works the night shift. He was off on holiday, so he's unreachable. Where is Barraza? He's not in the area. I didn't ask where he isn't. I asked where he is. Doesn't fit our profile. He's friendly, funny. Half of the residents accused him of smoking weed in the hallway. - What about the other half? - They're buying it from him. Lot of laughter. Krupp? We've I.D.'d the building's residents - and instigated background checks. - Mm-hmm. Counterterrorism are processing the profiles right now. Counterterrorism? Frank Graber requested them. I run the operation. Not Frank Graber. Not D.C. Certainly not you. They have twice our resources. I thought you'd be on board. I'm just trying to speed things along. I'll speed your ass out the door. If Frank Graber requests resuscitation, you need my approval first. Okay? That goes for everyone. What is it now? Confirmation that you are not requesting a curfew. Jesse Capleton asked you to sign. Why would I sign something that's the exact opposite of what I asked for? He said you agreed to in the meeting, and now he needs you on the record. Fucking asshole. Okay. Marquand? - Yes, sir. - Be straight with me. Have you been talking to counter terrorism? No, sir. Is it gonna stay that way? Yes, sir. Then what you got? Well, the shockwave analysis confirmed the use of a hand grenade. It's an M14. He turned on the gas, pulled the pin, - walked out, and he closed the door behind him. - Mm-hmm. There's also a lot of scratches under the lock. Like he had a big bunch of keys. Now, ballistics has their money set on an XM21 sniper system. Used in Vietnam, right up to Desert Storm. They updated the scope in '75, but we think it's one of the originals. If that's the case, we, uh... we got a problem. What's that? The gun is older than the database. That means we're gonna have to go old-school, match each piece of evidence manually with military archives state by state. - It's a fart in a hurricane. - That's very poetic. That's what my wife says. What does the Army do with weapons that are no longer in use? Mckenzie: If they're in decent condition, they get kicked down to local law enforcement. Some get dismantled, others get redistributed to armed allied forces around the world. Who dismantles them? Uh, the arsenal keepers. Every base unit has one. But who actually verifies that they're destroyed? You know what? Get the keeper records. Active duty, prosecutions, missing weapons, - psych trauma, PTSD. - We're on it. We can all use more help, Nathan, but I need collaboration, not competition. There has to be a clear chain of command. Personal question? Don't you think Lammark's a bit paranoid about other teams being involved? Not really. Everyone's looking for credit. I've seen way too many cases derail from friendly fire. ♪ My God. Tell me you got something here. Height, weight, anything. That distance... I can't even start to speculate. Small entrance, large exit on all. One shot per victim. Head, chest, neck... gone. - All yours, my friend. - Yeah. You ever seen anything like this, Mac? Not outside the Army. Very few inside. I mean, you got wind, fireworks distracting you. It's flawless. Someone knows how good this guy is. Military-trained or high-level sports. Either way, this is winning medals. Is the shooter a man? Yes. Why? At this scale? Unprecedented. Planned or spontaneous? - Mckenzie: Planned. - Spontaneous. Then why did he have a weapon? He was trespassing. Maybe he was expecting the police. With a 40-year-old sniper rifle? Different genders, different races. Some old, some quite young. There's no pattern. Why? Well, we can speculate that nature's not to blame. Culture is. We're all different. We still act the same. Rush hour, lunch hour, Black Friday, New Year's Eve. We just blindly follow the same patterns. He's not punishing people. He's disrupting behavior. There's no torture, no reveling in the suffering. Just a... poof... Quick one-way ticket to Narnia. Sir. They have him. What do you mean, "They have him"? Who has him? ♪ Frank? I'm heading this up till Nathan says otherwise. Hey, don't have a heart attack. I'm not here to undermine you. We just have to move fast. We're checking up the residents, and this kid rings alarm bells all over the place. We try to question him, he locks himself in his room and threatens to kill everyone, which is never a good sign. Alpha Team, into position. Beta Team, clear the floor. Do we have eyes on the weapon? Repeat, is the weapon confirmed? It was nice of you to invite everyone before calling me! He ticks every box: ADHD, skips school because he gets bullied, spends all night watching ISIS clips and blowing out brains on video games. And his uncle Aziz took him to the gun club last summer. This is where the tenants of 12 Redwood Street are staying on your dime. Now it seems the killer is among them. How'd he access the apartment? The Rahmanis... They live above it. He could've climbed to the ledge. He knows the area. Probably planned out this whole thing. Ready to go. 20 seconds. Copy that. Alpha Team, we're going in. Do we know for certain that he's armed? He said he was gonna kill everyone! I asked whether he was armed, not what he said! There was a mattress in that condo. Why would there be one if he lived upstairs? Who is this? Why is she even here? It's okay, Eleanor. In three, two, one. Go, go, go! Did you give the go-ahead? Back off, Lammark! - Get down on the floor! - Get down! Where's the weapon? Stay the fuck right where you are! - I didn't do anything! - What the fuck are you doing? Get a life mat. He's going for the window! He's going for the fucking window! Get a life mat! Your tax dollars are paying for their room service. Now it seems the killer has been among them all along. Where's the weapon, Frank? So far, you haven't found a catapult. He could've stashed it anywhere. You don't have a firearm. You're oceans away from establishing any connection to an old XM21 rifle in particular. You don't get to become a first-class marksman playing video games. So, you either find some evidence here, make some sense of it, or admit that this has been a colossal fuck up! Come on, Lammark. If it wasn't him, how come he jumped? I don't know, maybe it's 'cause of that fucking parasite Jimmy Kittridge calling him a terrorist on live TV. Arab kid, Baltimore high school. Do you think he pictured himself becoming homecoming king after that? Okay, but for now, it could've been him, right? I mean, until he's proven innocent? Jesse, it's supposed to be the other way around. Not when we're competing with six other states for a $9 billion gas plant. I need the people out there to feel safe, Lammark. This shows them we're on it. It buys us more time. Are you gonna tell that shit to the Rahmanis? Go ahead, tell 'em that, 'cause I got fucking work to do. Three painters worked the apartment. We've got Rodney Lang, Abraham Haynes and Dimitri Bovrov. Mr. Lang, this should be quick. I hope you don't mind. Uh, I brought backup. Wife's working a double, so... guess who's in charge of little Desmond here. Desmond, huh? Had an uncle called Desmond. Used to write erotic novels under the, uh, name "Melody Bangs." - Okay. - I suppose you remember where you were last night? Uh, yeah. Actually, we... went down to the harbor to watch the fireworks. We were there. Scary shit. You got... you got proof? - Proof? - Mm-hmm. We got proof, yeah. Like a million selfies. At my mother-in-law's. I thought you caught the guy. Maybe. No pictures? Mm... Of my mother-in-law? Lots of pictures. Big party. Cousins, nephews. What am I doing here? Am I a suspect? I just stripped the fucking place. Two years ago. Mckenzie: Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. It's all good. Just asking you questions. I was at my apartment alone. Relax, Dimitri. It's still legal to spend a night alone in this country. Can you prove it? My, uh, neighbor, maybe he see me come in? And, uh, I call my father in Russia. Perhaps you can verify with phone company? But you did get some... some military training in Russia, right? Did you get any shooting practice? Sir, I did not kill those people. I find it shameful that I need to explain this to you. I'm an honest man, and I work hard for what I have. Yes, I did shooting practice... Two weeks. Then I break my arm, so no good for shooting. They tell me to go clean barracks, so I sweep, I wash windows, and that is how I serve my country. Mr. Haynes, why did you stop working at DeLuxe Painting and Repairs? Maybe I wasn't fast enough. You'd have to ask them. So, you... you stripped the place. - Alone. - Yes. What else do you remember? That light. The view. We worked the lounge together. Then Dimitri stayed extra for the bedrooms. I think. No, I did the bedrooms. I'm sure. Eleanor, would you consider it sexist of me if I asked you to take little Desmond here and put him to sleep? Oh. Thanks, sweetie. Mr. Lang, you've got quite the, uh... the gig in wall painting, right? You're a regular at DeLuxe. A string of work for Ultraviolet as well? Well, uh, kids don't come cheap. ♪ ♪ Hi. Excuse me. Preliminary lab report. - Oh. - Mind signing it for me? - Okay. Sure. - Thanks. Awesome. Thank you. No, guys, please. Guys! Do you want an investigation, or do you want an entertainment event? Hey, Eleanor. Did you receive a package from the lab? Yes, sir. I've included it in my report. The urine and fecal samples were scarce, but there was still enough to detect an iron deficiency. I looked it up, and it's common amongst people who don't eat meat. What time did it arrive? - I don't know, 20 minutes ago? - 45. I didn't have it, so, uh, I rang the lab. - Checked with the courier. - I'm sorry, sir. I was just trying to help. You were on the phone, and... This is specialized, urgent, classified intel. You are the BPD liaison, a beat cop, no college degree, but you decide that I should wait for your verdict. ♪ Eleanor, I'm sorry I snapped. I had a ridiculously stressful phone conversation. - I took it out on you. - No worries. Hey, I know it's late, but I have, uh, some new stuff to go over, and I could use some of your brain. Want to come have some dinner, talk it through with a good glass of wine? Sir, if you hired me so you could fuck me, you can take this job and you can shove it up your ass. Eleanor, I'm married. Come and have dinner with us. You look like you could use a good meal. You also think it's gonna happen again. Why did you sign that memo? You can't fight every battle. Have to choose the ones you can win. Yeah, but when you sign, you're a part of the game. And when you don't, they replace you. The only decision you're making is whether to be buried or burned. Jesse Capleton can't fire you. He's not your boss. Jesse Capleton operates my boss, who operates him in return. Guys like that, it's a circle jerk. All it takes is one call. "Don't you think Lammark's a little off his game?" "Well, there is no bigger fan than me, but we do have to think of his heart." They each say what the other one wants to hear. Before you know it, you're packing your desk into a box. - Humble opinion? - Mm-hmm? It's not 'cause they're scared you won't catch him. It's 'cause they're scared you will. You crack this, you get the spotlight. Some people just can't stand the shadows. There's something odd about Lang. The watch, the shoes, bringing the baby in. It's not Lang. His alibi's solid. But I'll call Tracey in the morning if you want to monitor his comm. How long have you been married? Ever since we were allowed. That's the big question: how people shape systems, how systems shape us. Can I get you a little... Oh, just water, thank you. Today, it's all about status. The people that have it would kill to protect it, the people that want it would kill to achieve it, and everybody else gets crushed in between. Governments, corporations and high schools. Pattern seems to be the same. How do we change that? You mean empathy, connection? If we truly see ourselves in others, we want to raise them up, not bring them down. If we ever run out of money, you are gonna write fridge magnets. I'm serious... You would be fantastic. Oh. What are they saying? You don't want to know. Gavin, I do want to know. That's why I asked. You know the drill. First 24 hours is: "Who did this?" And then after that, it's: "Who's the idiot that's not catching him?" No, I meant the theory. - Oh. Right. - What's the theory? - Mm-hmm. - Sleeper cells of terrorists in every American town, an inside job designed to scrap civil liberties laws. Jewish plot? Take your pick. And what's yours? Such a good question. - Let me see. - Bad call. She asked. I think your man wasn't born here. Hmm. I think he feels a place he grew up in has become a pretty awful place, along with a good portion of the world... and I think he believes this nation is responsible for at least 50% of that mess. Shit. If you weren't afraid of heights, I'd book you as a suspect. What scares me is that a good portion of you - thinks this man has a point. - Mm-hmm. About the country that stopped the Nazis... - Mm. Right. - Stepped on the moon, mapped the entire human genome and landed a spacecraft on Mars 140 million miles from your current position. While landing our brands, our plastic, our distortion, our exaggeration everywhere else. I went to Bogotá to lecture. Best damn coffee on Earth, right? You know where they took me? Starbucks. We take the best of everywhere, and we send it back worse for profit. And that's what we do to our friends. Profits pay taxes, which pays for research and development. - Eleanor... - Gavin, go to bed, or I'll arrest you for harassing two public servants. I give up. I give up. So, Eleanor, why did you lie to me? Sir? You were rejected by the Bureau. You decided not to tell me? That's what pissed me off, not the lab report. Yeah, it was eight years ago. I didn't think it would matter. We're under the microscope. Everything matters. I just thought I could prove myself before I got found out. I should have told you. I'm sorry. You aced observation and knowledge. It was your psych eval that did you in. "Aggressive, addictive, antisocial." This is the profile of people we arrest, not hire. - You know when they ask you to draw a tree? - Mm-hmm. The trunk represents your life up to the present. - Yeah. - And from the picture, Dr. Katz conjectured that something fucked you up, and pretty badly, around the age of 12. There's no soil. Tree has no roots, no fruit. Did something happen back then? - Is this necessary? - It's not mandatory. I just want to know if we should fire Dr. Katz, 'cause I think you got talent. "Have you ever tried any illegal substances?" "Yes." "Which ones?" "All of them." That didn't help your application, either. What were you thinking? Kurt Cobain: "I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I'm not." Yeah. He's not exactly a role model, according to the Bureau. You worked at a dry cleaner's and with a call center. Hey, why didn't you look for something with more prospects? You're smart, articulate. Well, that doesn't count for much when you don't go to college. So, why didn't you? Because there was no one to pay for it. And when you work all day trying to make rent, you don't feel like studying; you feel like sleeping. What led you to law enforcement? I was looking for protection. From who? From myself. That enough for you? No. Eleanor... the only thing enough for me is a solid lead. The hatred that drives our shooter isn't so different from yours. Instead of going out there and wiping everybody out, you turn it against yourself. I need you to use it as fuel to bring me something new. Now. We get this guy, this all goes away. And we can both do the job we were meant to. ♪ Would you like your teeth whitened, ma'am?

Is there anywhere else he could be hiding? There's nowhere he couldn't. He used to stay in camps, then parks. Then he started sleeping in empty houses. I always knew that, um... he would eventually get into trouble, but... I never expected anything like this. Mrs. Possey, who shot him? We did. Dean was a great little kid. He was funny and smart.

Jumped a fence, walked around the lake, and there they were. Magnificent. They seemed grateful for their existence. They didn't want to change. Didn't want to evolve.

Time's up, asshole! ♪ ♪ Stay right where you are! - Show me your hands! - Don't fucking move! Mckenzie: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold! Hold! Mckenzie: Eleanor? He's alive. He's wounded, but he's alive. What the hell happened? Why didn't you call me? I tried. I really tried. - What? - Lammark wouldn't let me. ♪ All units, we need more men on the ground. State troopers out to the river. - Distribute weapons and vests. - Copy that. Chopper unit, stand by. ♪ Canine team, looks like we picked up a scent. Copy that. What's your location? We're in sector nine, heading south. We have footprints, and looks like fresh blood in the snow. Copy that. Rerouting all mobile units. Sector nine, factory site. ♪ Eleanor, we went through your debriefing, and we came up with this strategy. Collectively. We hope you'll be happy to sign. The entire operation will remain classified. As far as the record's concerned, this was an authorized plan. BPD and the Bureau cracked the case, got our killer, with the state government's full support. Period. Not a word about what happened in that house, not a word of your history with drugs. However, despite your previous record, we all agreed that you've more than proved yourself, so the Bureau would like to offer you a permanent post as intelligence analyst. Is this your way of buying my silence? You really expect me to help cover up your incompetence, your lack of judgment, your willingness to put lives at risk? He's trying to help you, Eleanor. You were suspended. Lammark had been fired. But still, you illegally contacted Lang, interrogated him without a lawyer and set off without authorization, leading directly to 17 extra fatalities. So, instead of letting the press make you a hero for 15 minutes, then destroying your life, we're offering you a way forward. I want you to honor Lammark with a posthumous Medal of Valor. And I want you to transfer his full pension to his husband. We can do that. I don't want to be an analyst. Make me special agent. You know I deserve it. Done. Any tricks, now or later, and I will let everyone know that you have blood on your hands. Thanks, Eleanor. I'm glad we understand each other. We don't. ♪ Good work, Falco. Thank you, sir. ♪ We get this guy, this all goes away, and we can both do the job we were meant to. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
