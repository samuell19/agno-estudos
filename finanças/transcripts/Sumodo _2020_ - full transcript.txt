Tokyo Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena The tickets for today's tour are sold out. Japan Sumo Association Okinoumi Hakkaku stable, Birthplace Shimane Prefecture Kotoshogiku Sadogatake stable, Birthplace Fukuoka Prefecture Shodai Tokitsukaze stable, Birthplace Kumamoto Prefecture Tochiozan Kasugano stable, Birthplace Kochi Prefecture And last, Ozeki Takayasu Tagonoura stable, Birthplace Ibaraki Prefecture Tochiozan Goeido Begin! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! To put it simply, sumo wrestler makes his opponent lose his balance. So, in order not to fall, the one thing that matters is how to stay in the ring. Sumo wrestlers are samurai. In the past, the feudal lord kept sumo wrestlers, called rikishi, as samurai. The characters used to write 'rikishi' are power and samurai, so they were. It's amazing, really! After I retired, I've been reflecting on just how amazing sumo wrestlers are. They are put through the mill, and so they have a big body. And they are quite agile for having such powerful bodies. I thought they have an enormous body. Christmas KITTE, Marunouchi Christmas Hibiya Park Christmas Toneri, Adachi Ward 7am Sakaigawa stable Sakaigawa stablemaster I often visit the Sakaigawa stable, and I think what a good old sumo stable it is. Of course the training is strict, and it is brimming with energy. It has remained just like in the past, this strict stable. Whatever one may say. I have taken notice of Tsushimanada. He has a generous disposition. He flings his opponents with all his strengths aggressively. Not to mention that he is handsome, after all. Toyohibiki First of all, Tsushimanada is really trying his best at training. Being able to do your best at training, is actually a talent, a natural aptitude. If you can't do your best at training you definitely can't become strong. Sadanoumi Sadanoumi, meanwhile, it feels like a wall. I sometimes practice with Sadanoumi. Anyway, he has a powerful stamping, that's why it feels like you are striking a wall, hard. So the impact, it feels like it returns directly on you. Myogiryu His instantaneous force is incredible. I rank him among the top young rikishi for his powerful force, face-off and other outstanding movements. It is extremely difficult to keep pushing with your knees bent. It looks easy to do, but in reality, it is extremely difficult. There are skills, of course. Goeido What is wonderful about Goeido's skill is the power he generates when grabbing the front of the belt from the left. If you are taken like this, you can no longer move, and he is full of energy. Ozeki Goeido gives you the feeling of being a samurai. I think he is a great wrestler and I would like for him to win again. To stretch it a little, I would like him to become a Yokozuna. The history of sumo coincides with Japan's history. Sumo is considered to have started in ancient times, from the hot-blooded trials of strength and hand-to-hand combat of men. In the Heian period, it was transformed into a pastime for nobility and became an event of the Imperial Court. During the Warring States Period, sumo is said to have come into wide practice as battle training by the samurai. In the age of provincial wars, fighting was ubiquitous. Fighting means grappling with each other. The fighters wore armour and it difficult to give the coup de grace. So you would drag him down, catch him and throw him down. And then, it seems there is an open space in here. So you would draw your short sword and slash! You would give the coup de grace. Mainly it was this kind of fighting. This is why sumo, well... it is suitable for this. This is why, you have to put your life on the line. It is never just a little game. It requires you stake your life. Well, everyday is a traffic accident, Two people who weigh 200kg bump into each other. Even if you keep training, when it hurts, it hurts. Well, there is no other sport that requires this much training without wearing any protective equipment. There is no glove, no headgear, Goeido, the most powerful rikishi of the Sakaigawa stable, having the rank of Ozeki, just one step from the title of yokozuna, he once won a tournament without a single loss. And for four and a half years he has been defending his position. So, you have to become strong and wrestle to the winning point. The only real choice is endure a steady stream of hardships. If you keep running away from these hard things, you will never become mentally strong. Wrestlers who put a lot of effort are the strong ones, I believe. New Year Shogenji temple Happy New Year to you all! Last year, everyone concerned at the Shogenji temple, took so good care of us! Let us all include Shogenji in our prayers this year as well. Yes. Yo-ho! OK. Yo-ho! OK. Yo-ho. OK. Yo-ho. OK. Mochi pounded by rikishi, who symbolize power, is believed to bring luck. Yes, please. Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho! OK. It's time for the January Tournament. Please take good care of Myogiryu, our new Komusubi. Well, he has written down his interests. Strengthening his calf muscles from his hips. Yo-ho! Please show us your calves! No.1 in the sumo world! OK. Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Everyone, you know of course Ozeki Goeido. Here, Goeido. Yo-ho! Yo-ho! He will share his interests with you. He likes cats a lot. OK. Yo-ho! A little more. Five more times. Thank you! This year, I would like us to celebrate Ozeki Goeido's victory. Please give him a warm hand of applause. Well, Ozeki Goeido. Thank you very much! Well... Goeido was a classmate. We went to the same school in Saitama. We were together on the day we entered the school dorm. I rode the shinkansen from Himeji, and Goeido got on at Osaka. Myogiryu boarded first, and it was our mothers who coordinated our times. I figure we rode at specific times to travel together. What did we talk about? About how to become strong like the two of us. Looking forward to something... I remember going together talking about such thing. Well, I knew his name from elementary school. He used to win all the children's tournaments. I couldn't make the team after entering that school. But Ozeki Goeido, he was a member since the first grade and participated in bouts. At first, he wasn't strong enough to make it to the national high school championship. But he rapidly improved to the point of advancing to the championship bout there. Finally, in our last year of high school, we faced each other in the finals of inter-high school competitions. Well, I had my defeats but I never thought I'd be competing on such a big stage. So, I was happy. What do you think about Myogiryu now? I think about taking care of his body and training, he is the most knowledgeable among everybody around here. - Let's go to 200kg - Fine! Oh. Then let's go! Yes. OK. Impressive! Amazing! Wow! Please measure this part here. Here? Wow! I've never done this before. 80? 81 centimeters. How big is director's? Mine? You're thin! 40... 45 centimeters. So it's double. I don't know if this is thick or not. This is more than just being thick. These are the legs of someone truly powerful. OK, let's start, 100kg. Well, I've been lifting weights for 17 years now. Since I started sumo in high school, I've been training with weights. There is all kinds of information nowadays. But that doesn't mean that I put everything into practice. I use my own equipment. Like this. A tire? How much does it weigh? It weighs 320kg. A trailer tire. This is tough practice! Is this some type of sumo strength training? It definitely does, so it's better to do it than not. Does Goeido have powerful muscles? You mean muscle strength? Muscle strength really means power sumo for... for grabbing your opponent's belt, pulling him in, and stepping through with great force. What this power is it would be difficult to say. It's something heavy you feel inside yourself. Anyway, he has tremendous power. Sadanoumi My father was a rikishi and I wanted to become one ever since kindergarten. When I turned fifteen, my father asked me. Which stable do you want to go to, Dewanoumi or Sakaigawa? Well, as my father was trained in the Dewanoumi stable, I thought obviously I would go there. But then my father told me something. In order to build character, you should go to Sakaigawa. This is what helped make up my mind to come here. Training matches where the winner picks his next opponent In the sumo ring, it doesn't matter if you are senior or junior. The winner remains at ringside and designates the next wrestler. And basically wrestler at the front of the line get bought, and buy that I mean choose. You see, the wrestlers who want to get up front make a dash and dive forward, then demand. If you're standing at the back, you'll never get designated. Who wants to become stronger just keep fighting for the front. It is not a club activity. This is our job. So you put everything into it. It is up to each and every one of us, whether we do it or not. I was an amateur and I could climb to the rank of makushita, all thanks to training. This happens often. An opponent forges forwards and hits me in the face giving me a bloody nose. I don't really get irritated when I get hit in the face. It's more like I get heated up. Does getting heated up impact your personal ties? Training is training and it's nothing personal. Head-to-head training When I first started, I often felt overwhelmed by them. I literally couldn't even move them. They wouldn't budge an inch. What's going on here? I felt like I was wrestling a rock. Your thighs start to hurt really badly and the feeling is that you can't breath. You start hyperventilating. If you are chosen for the head-to-head training, although it is very tough, you become strong if you do it. I get up thinking that I will become strong. It is really a challenge. Even myself when I was young, getting battered again and again everyday, is what I attribute to why I've gotten this strong. Training their juniors and making them stronger is the duty of the senior rikishi. Centipede training Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! There is what's called centipede training, because it looks like an actual centipede. The person behind grabs the belt of the person in front and pulls him down. It's so much harder than practicing footwork by yourself. The centipede training comes at the end of the session, so everyone is really exhausted. The Principles of the Sakaigawa stable Second, we respect our predecessors and the departed, and guide our juniors. Third, we have a strong heart, kindness and courage. Fourth, the accumulation of these moments now is our future. Fifth, everything returns to me. Sixth, we won't leave any regrets on the path that we have chosen. Seventh, if you watch with your eyes and listen with your ears, don't fear failing. Just do it! Eighth, there is never a time when you are the only one in pain. When you've lost your way, remember your home and your family. Ninth, where there is a will, here is a way. Tenth, a pure heart is the spirit of Sumodo, the way of the samurai. Shibuya Osteopathic Clinic I will work on your back now. It hurts! How many from the Sakaigawa stable come here? Well, everyone from there comes here. The neck is the part needs the most attention. Everyone dives in head first, so it is really the neck that gets the most damage. I think the wrestlers get quite a lot of injuries. By wearing athletic protectors and trying to keep things fixed in place, somehow or other, they still injure themselves. It hurts! Ouch, ouch, ouch... Ow! It's twitching! My leg is cramped! I think, Goeido did a great job... to stand in the ring, without showing that he is hurting although he is badly injured. I can't believe it. At the time of the Kyushu Tournament nobody knew that you are badly injured. You withdrew from the tournament but what happened? The Kyushu Tournament was held one month before this interview. In this bout, Goeido was injured. Shodai Begin! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! When I stretched out my right arm, I threw hard when my opponent got to throw me using his outside arm. It was when I hit him back that I tore my biceps. It's not a complete rupture, but it's partially torn. The biceps are joined here. It's this part up here. Three days after tearing a muscle in his right arm. Goeido, refusing to tape up his injured arm stands in the sumo ring. Kaisei Begin! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not taping up a body part that's injured, I think, is something only Goeido can pull through. If it were me, I would be too afraid to re-injure myself, so I would think to tape it up until it was stiff as a board. That's how I'd do it. You didn't even tape it up. Aren't you afraid? On the contrary, I was afraid that I would reveal my weak point. How did you recover? Well, I did various treatments. I did acupuncture and warmed it up in hot water. Well, I did everything. Nothing serious. Seven days before the January Tournament, that day, praying for the success of the Sakaigawa stable, we treated them to Korean barbecue restaurant close to the stable. Thank you very much for today, director! So, I will let them indulge themselves. Let's drink a toast! Cheers! Just like Goeido had said, wrestlers took to eating without reservation. How many wrestlers came here today? About 30 people? 36 people. They've already eaten more than for 100 people. How many cups of rice did you prepare? The rice so far... We prepared 140 bowls of rice and will make another 70 bowls. For the rikishi, having a big body is the most powerful weapon. For this reason, throughout their meal they just keep eating. You don't really need to film this! How many people is this dish for? You mean the meat? 200... 200...? It's for about 200 people. About two hours into the meal... I'm leaving. Goeido left the restaurant to have his arm treated. Beef tongue, 5 servings Fatty pork... We are out of fatty pork today. We're also out of beef stomach after that last order of 10. You can't serve the beef stomach for Tables 8 and 9? That's right! We're out of it. And no more beef stomach sashimi either? That's gone too! In two and a half hours, the rikishi ate all the meat the restaurant had. Director The receipt is very long, isn't it? It really is. It's neverending. This is the end. Are you ready? That comes to 806,800 yen (or about 8,000 dollars). 80... Wow, it's bad. I must have put on 10kg today! Incredible appetites! We wish them all success in the tournament. I am so full! Thank you! It was a great dinner! Thank you for the wonderful meal! Six days before the January Tournament Something extraordinary was happening to Goeido. Because Ozeki Goeido never lets on if he's in pain or not, he is the only one who knows if it is healing or not. He'd act like nothing happened even if he is badly injured. From how your arm looks, I assume it doesn't hurt anymore? It's fine. Do you have any worries? Are you worried about anything? Well, I think the muscles are still weak as compared to before. I'm worried about it. Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena The sumo ring is rebuilt for each ensuing tournament One match daily for 15 days, eight or more victories... this is the magic number for the rikishi in the elite makuuchi division strive to achieve. If the number is less than eight, they will be demoted, and sometimes they have to bow out of the sumo ring. One after another, the strong rikishi struggle to climb the ranking pyramid aiming to take the place that Ozeki like Goeido continue to defend. The January Tournament has finally started. Tokyo Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena Sekiwake Tamawashi Kataonami stable Birthplace, Mongolia Ozeki Tochinoshin Kasugano stable Birthplace, Georgia And last, Ozeki Goeido Sakaigawa stable Birthplace, Osaka Goeido! Goeido! Of course, I've been doing tournaments for years now, but still on the first day, I get a unique feeling of nervousness. It's the New Year, I think... the first bout, I'm thinking that I'd like to get off to a good start. Nishikigi 0 Wins 1 Loss Day 2 of January Tournament The prize is offered by Nada no sake, Seishu Ozeki Co, LTD Goeido! 0 Wins 2 Losses Two successive defeat since the first day. For Goeido, this was the start of stormy days. Then, on this day, Sadanoumi, another rikishi from the Sakaigawa stable, split his forehead open butting heads with his opponent. Two huge rikishi heads collide... An average person would be knocked out cold. Next day Well, the injury itself... because I got a gash on my forehead, I went to the sumo association clinic thinking that I would get it disinfected. But I was told, "You're going to need stitches." But I don't want stitches. Even if I bother with it, if it's to open again, it will open. And all that will happen if it opens again is that it'll bleed. That's all. Doesn't it hurt? Are you all right? Well, no, it's not like it doesn't hurt at all. But, even if you say it is an injury to the head, it's actually an injury to the skin. So it doesn't bother me that much. In the momentum, the opponent Ikioi also split his forehead. Despite the injury to his forehead, Sadanoumi showed his manly courage. Day 4 of January Tournament 0 Wins 4 Losses Up to this point, four successive defeats. It was clear that Goeido was not in his best shape. Perhaps, to some extent, I could move, but deep inside it just didn't feel right. How is your right arm? It's fine, really. But were these words true in reality? 1 Win 4 Losses I still have 1 victory and 4 defeats so I can't be relieved or anything just yet. I am telling myself I should do my best tomorrow, I should be in the game with all my heart. Throughout the 15 days of the January Tournament, the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena was crowded with many sumo fans, enjoying the festivities of Japan's national sport. Here the rikishi stake their lives, and keep fighting through pain and mental anguish. Goeido was one of them. It's only one bout per day, but I am exhausted both mentally and physically. During a tournament, there is nothing else I would like to do besides sumo. Until this tournament ends, sumo is always there in the corner of my mind and I think that is why my brain gets so tired. And the body also of course. Okinoumi 3 Wins 6 Losses When it became 3 victories and 6 defeats, really, I thought that it was all over, and so, I was thinking that I should do my best in the next tournament, as a do-or-die situation. There are still six bouts left, but in the assessment I have to win five more. And last, only Yokozuna Ozeki remained. But, during the remaining six days, I thought that it was all right even if I lost as long as I put my whole heart into it. That's right. That was my only feeling. For Goeido, six days of standing on the edge of an abyss started. 4 Wins 6 Losses 5 Wins 6 Losses 6 Wins 6 Losses 7 Wins 6 Losses Goeido gained momentum with four consecutive victories. One more win, to secure a winning record. His opponent is... the most powerful rikishi in the sumo history, Hakuho Yokozuna. Day 14 of January Tournament An unexpected event has transpired on Goeido's journey. I found out at the morning training. I was surprised. Truly. Hakuho is no longer appearing in the tournament due to his right knee hematoma and to arthrisis in his left leg. Consequently, Goeido wins the match by default. 8 Wins 6 Losses Winning his eighth bout. And achieving a winning record. Well, to tell you the truth, I was relieved... Well, I think it was luck, that's all to it. But, I can't really be happy with all my heart. I wanted to have a winning record through a clean victory. I would have felt revived then. January Tournament Closing day His final opponent, having 11 victories and 3 defeats, is Takakeisho, upon whom the championship match falls. 9 Wins 6 Losses My position in the initial charge was the best. During these 15 days. I could take him at a good angle and at the attack that followed, I could plunge my right slightly. I was quick in the initial charge and I would say it was an ideal attack. I am glad I could wrestle so well. Fighting for 15 straight days is a tremendous mental challenge. That's right. It feels like I am shrinking with each tournament. Goeido would like the junior wrestlers of the Sakaigawa stable to succeed I want them to remember to be stoic and not complain, like a true man. I want them to remember Wrestlers nowadays tend to display their pain and they intentionally reveal when they are hurt. Such wrestlers have been increasing in number. I want them to remember to be stoic and not make excuses. April Shizuoka Tour Hey, you can't see my face! Well, Ryuden is already famous. Probably he is the one who trains the most. I think he works out 3 or 4 times more than other sekitori-wrestlers. Due to a hip joint injury, when his ranking dropped from sekitori to jyonokuchi he experienced bitterness. When I look back that time, I think he's done remarkably well to come this far. Normally, hip joint is not easily broken. But, his pelvis, near the pubis, was broken, and then it broke again during training, which forced him to miss a tournament. It broke again after he thought it had healed. If the bones are not connected any more, the internal organs which the pelvis supports would come out. The injury was so severe that he may not continue a normal life, there would be no more second chances. It was such a devastating injury. When wrestlers get hurt, I always say, God is giving you a trial. It's a message that you need to train more. Takadagawa stable Ryuden We fight a sport of clashing powers. In order to endure such impacts, we practice, stomping like, Boom! Boom! By stomping, we build fine physiques to endure the shocks. You can do stomping in an easy way, or you can make it as hard as you want. Since I made a comeback, I concentrated on the basics. I've had positive results for the past 2 to 3 years. Takadagawa stablemaster When he got hurt, I didn't coddle him but was tough with him instead. You are weak, that's why you got hurt! You don't become strong because you do training. Strong guys are strong anyway. But after all, the human mind is weak. To prop it up, there is nothing but more training. I train myself hard, that's why I can keep going, I can overcome this hardship. It is with this spirit that we train. It's obvious that one has to make efforts. Since Ryuden had the injury, he must use it as a spring board and to lead a sumo life without regret, there is nothing but tireless efforts. I look forward to your precious guidance. My stablemaster, he retired some 10 years ago, but even now he puts on the belt. To fight well, it needs to sink into your body, enabling you to unconsciously do your best. If I sit here and just talk, no one would understand me. I actually use my body and work together with them so that they can understand. When the master comes down to the ring, wearing the belt, it's like he's one of us practicing his sumo. He trains and thinks just like us. That is something different from other stables. You take lessons from the master, and carefully consider your own style of sumo. You don't just do it, but you do it with thought. That is a very good thing. Kagayaki What I think is, in short, if you are in a fog, struggling hard to find an exit, you don't know what to do. So, a light is necessary to guide you. You will then clearly see the exit through the fog, and if you head for it, you will get there. It's no use to say, "You have no guts or motivation?" When you are groping in the dark, you don't get guts or motivation. That said, I remind my disciples to believe only 80% of what I teach them, and they must devise 20% by themselves. You can't do it all. Try your way once. Then discard things unnecessary and absorb things necessary. When you've tallied 20% in such a way, you have the ownership, as you devised it by yourself. It's not something someone taught you, but your own discovery. Unless you do it this way, you won't be able to step up rapidly. Is that right? It applies to everything. Regarding Ryuden, in your view, what kind of rikishi is he? Well, he is the serious type. A bit rough in the grand tournaments... I wish he'd perform more speedy sumo. Usually, the stablemaster and rikishi live together in shared quarters. Ryuden, the top of the Takadagawa stable, showed us his private room. Oh, my 'futon' beddings isn't put away. Yes, it's fine! It's tidy! How big is this room? I'm not sure how big. A 6-mat room? Right. Those are all yours too? Yes. Are all 4 in this group good friends? Yes. We joined the stable in the same year. Great. Only a few things here. That's right, I moved. You moved, you mean your stuff? I've gotten married. And have been moving my stuff little by little. So, you already rented an apartment with your wife... Then, will you soon move out of this room? Yes, that's right. Well, everyone doesn't have a private room. No, a private room is given to those who are jyuryo or above. Depending on the stable, the system may differ. But, basically you get a private room at sekitori rank. Shared room of junior rikishi What's that for? What do you mean? What you're wearing. This is for sleep apnea. What's it called? CPAP Because we stop breathing, we sleep in here. Oh, everyone has sleep apnea? No, only 3 of us right now. Us three. Just the 3 of you? You become apneic? Right, my breathing stops. While you are sleeping? Yes. When will you start living with your wife? Well, the master says anytime. Lately he's said, anytime is OK for him. So, I bring my stuff little by little... Probably I will complete it after the wedding. When is the wedding? June 9th. Then, after Tokyo Grand Tournament, in May. That's right. Surely I've got to win. Definitely you have to have more wins than losses, in this tournament prior to the wedding. Right. Do you feel such a pressure? Yes, I do, but I'm hoping to change it to positive motivation. Well, still fatty food... They are all young, so they like that food with strong flavor. But if they keep eating such foods, it's bad for their health. So, I would say it's rather a vegetable-centered diet. Yes, I do pay attention to such an aspect. Needless to say, I consider how to build their physiques and make their bodies big. I keep that in mind as I prepare meals. And stablemaster has a wish to let them enjoy delicious food. "Don't waste food, use ingredients carefully," "and cook tasty food for them," those are the instruction from the stablemaster. Today, it seems he cooked it with extra effort. It tastes much better than usual, about 30% more. During my short stay here for the trial course, if I was asked what was a decisive factor for joining this stable, I would have said first, the friendly attitude of the senior members, and then the delicious chanko hot pots. Our stablemaster is quite concerned with our meals. I am grateful for that. Today, when I was in the practice room, you were doing muscle training a lot. You were thrusting your junior with your head. Do you still train yourself even now? Yeah, to some extent. You have to tune up your body. Otherwise nobody would follow you. I see, you yourself have to be like that. If I practice this much, then the guys should do likewise. It means, "Keep up with me!" Whenever I remember you as Akinoshima, your body was covered with a lot of fresh bruises. The training was outrageous, too. At that time, we were training like hell. One more question. You were bold as Akinoshima as well as the master Takadagawa, and up until 2 or 3 years ago, you had a completely different training from today's. "Go! Go! Go!" In the past, we had cases where even an unmotivated person became strong when we fired him up and gained respect as he improved his personality. But, nowadays, it's considered power harassment. It has been a little more than a year after I changed methods, so it's been sluggish for the past year. You have already sensed that? Yes, I have. In the past, although the current training room is charged with tension, in the past... how do I put it I felt like I would be killed or I wondered if I would make it home alive. Such an atmosphere had existed. Was it that tough? Yes. But, he stopped berating us. You won't be reprimanded, even if you don't do sumo. That's the time when I was distressed. Whether or not you do it or you don't. That's a choice you have to make. And then you will take ownership of that. If you do something on your own initiative, I am sure that it's more beneficial to you. Then, what you do is to keep on putting forth the effort. Having the feeling that you will be happy to die in the ring, as well as having enthusiasm. You must concentrate even more on pursuing the path of Sumodo. When I had a bout with Sadanoumi, I had a feeling that something got crushed. Well, I was relieved as it wasn't his bone. I felt something crushed out of shape, my opponent's... somewhere here. I thought. Well, at first, Ryuden became sekitori before me, so he has been my target ever since then. I saw him losing his rank due to an injury, and then dragging himself up. I really respect him for having climbed this high. And also something like the joy of wrestling... This feeling has intensified. All in all, I love sumo wrestling. I realized that after a comeback. It's a feeling that at long last, I can do sumo again. The pleasure... I enjoy it still now. When I joined the stable in my teens, I was given a real workout. I think that was very good. Lately, to some extent, we can even corner ourselves. You don't just execute your own style of sumo, but you do it while contemplating it carefully. Lately, I have been doing it this way more often. What are Ryuden's greatest strengths? Well... Ryuden is extremely flexible, especially in his upper body. It is very difficult to wrestle with him. You can convey your power to people with stiff bodies easily. Being more flexible makes it easier for your power to slip away. It's a tricky thing, conveying one's power. It is not something that I can grasp with my mind... It's just something that you experience, and it's really difficult to cope with. I have been told that I am slippery. So my attacks are squirmy. I can get into positions that normal wrestlers can't. I'm very lucky. Mai, Ryuden's wife I was invited to meet her through an acquaintance. He was 24 and I was 29 back then. I thought how young! I thought she was beautiful. Did you know Ryuden? No, I didn't, at all. I didn't know anything about sumo. But from the way he spoke he had a peaceful demeanor. His real-world experience is as much as mine. I thought he was a very pleasant person. So during the tournaments, do you watch on television and root for him at home? Yes, I do. When I'm not working that day. Wait. I mean, she's saying she watches on her days off, but even after a bout there is nothing from her, What happened? so I'll call her and find she's sleeping. Is that so? No. I start watching from when the makushita start. And being home alone drinking beer, I'll doze off before I even realize it and my bout will be over. This feels very much like there is no feeling of tension. It's probably good for me. The wedding will take place after the May tournament? That's right. Well... I'll be striving for a winning record. It would be great for him to accomplish that. It's a good thing, all right. But, you see, I keep looking toward the future. As long as he doesn't get injured, there will be a next time. Did you hear that just now? No, what were they saying? It's Ryuden! Wow! They recognize you. Found Ryuden! That kid. He may live nearby. While sumo is a sport, people pay good money to watch us, which makes sumo entertainment. It is also a most important Shinto ritual. That's what we must emphasize the most. Because even though we endure a lot of suffering during training, we learn not only how to fight but also how to be human. That is why I would like to wrestle fair and square and defeat their opponents with their own power. Ryuden, in this tournament, is listed banzuke, 7 places below Ozeki Goeido. He is fighting as the #5 maegashira. Through the next 15 days, Ryuden will face powerful opponents. Will he be able to win more than eight times and add more? Or... Summer Tournament Opening Day Ryuden's opponent in the first bout... is Myogiryu, who is from the same stable as Goeido. And who can leap into action instantaneously. The winning technique was a push out from behind. Ryuden won by pushing his opponent. Day 2 of Summer Tournament Abi Ryuden won by a hair. His opponent Abi lost his balance first, and was judged to be in a hopeless position, giving Ryuden the win. 2 Wins 0 Losses Ryuden won by a pushdown using his hands. How was the bout with Abi? I am glad I could win. How were your previous matches with Abi? I never beaten him, not even once. So that was your first victory. How about yesterday? Yesterday I won for the first time also. This is incredible! During a grand sumo tournament, after finishing a bout Ryuden has something that he never fails to do. It is this practice centered on muscular strength training. You have another bout tomorrow, aren't you tired? I am doing this so as not to get tired. Do other stables do this kind of training too? I don't know if they are doing it in the evening. I'm finished. Besides just the sumo bouts, there is something else that attracts sumo fans to attend the grand tournaments. They flock to see their favorites dressed in shiny kimono. Tochiozan Kasugano stable, Birthplace Kochi Prefecture And finally, Ozeki Takayasu Tagonoura stable, Birthplace Ibaraki Prefecture Nishikigi 6 Wins 2 Losses You've made a half turn through the tournament after making run in the first half, is there something different? No, not really... It's just that my physical condition gets easily deteriorated. So I pay close attention to that. There are seven days to go. Yes, seven days and I have to win twice more. But you are striving for more? Well, it's enough to set my goal on a winning record for the time being. With this ranking list, it's possible the rest of my opponents will be highly ranked. Well, I'll keep doing my best so that I will have such competition. This wish comes to fruition. Day 10 of Summer Tournament Banners of sellout crowd Ryuden! Do your best! So far, having a record of 6 victories and 3 defeats Ryuden's opponent this day is... the powerful rikishi with a banzuke listing just below that of Yokozuna... the Ozeki Takayasu. Will his usual techniques be enough? I thought about just keeping the same course, but in the bout with Ozeki Takayasu, I was a little stiff and felt like I overexerted myself. But when I'm wrestling someone higher ranked... How shall I put this? I have this feeling of not wanting to lose. I am the type who gets excited so even I felt like shouting, "Amazing! Well done!" The battle for a higher rank, yes. The battle for a higher rank continues after this day as well. Ryuden's junior rikishi gather in front of the television. On this day, the opponent that Ryuden has to face is... the Ozeki Goeido. Goeido As opposed to the January tournament, where he barely made eight victories, he is raising the bar with 7 victories and 3 defeats thus far. 7 Wins 3 Losses I was thinking, If I fail, I will be none the worse for it. So I thought that I may cause him some pain and make him think, "I hate this!" 7 Wins 4 Losses My goal is to move instinctively, without any thought. I'm running a slight fever. How high is it? 38.9 degrees. Really? It won't affect me, but I need to take better care of myself. Closing day Aoiyama During these 15 days, he showed a fine record of 10 victories and 5 defeats. In recognition of that success, Ryuden received the Technique Prize, given to the most skillful rikishi. The Technique Prize is a prize that praises your sumo, the sumo itself, so I am very happy to receive it. You look very happy! Yes, I'm really and truly happy! Happier than the Fighting Spirit Award. I am glad that everything ended well and the results were good. Us being in such close contact are also overjoyed at your performance! Yeah, it wouldn't have done much for your movie if I'd gotten thrashed in this tournament. HOTEL NEW OTANI TOKYO From now on, Ryuden is no longer alone. Gaining their power together, The two of them will advance down the path of Sumodo. Please keep cheering for him! Thank you very much for today! What Ryuden would like to pass on to his juniors The same amount of effort you put in, returns equally to you. As long as you win bouts, you will rise in the rankings. I think many rikishi are in a rush to achieve their goals. Thinking about how things will be in 2 or 3 years, I want to keep my wish of becoming strong alive. I think that it is important to just keep pursuing the same kind of things relentlessly. I urge everyone to never be hasty in giving up on those dreams. In all rikishi In all rikishi lies the spirit of sumo No matter how significantly the world evolves No matter how significantly the world evolves the spirit of sumo never changes.
