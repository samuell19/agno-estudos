THE AMERICAN BEAUTY Hello, Alfred. Shall we? - Are you sure? - Look. - My wife agrees as well. - Good. - 50,000 francs? - Only for you. - It looks a bit tired. - That's impossible. It hasn't been used for two years. - Is that it? - Why? - You mentioned a good bike. - That's what he said. - Is it working? - Has been for ten years. - It shows. - 50,000 is a bargain. For whom? For that money, I'd rather buy a car. - Wouldn't be much of a car. - At least you'd be able to sit. - Can't you sit on this? - You, but not me. Come on. Your wife will push. 500 new francs. T.V. First owner, special offer. - That comes down to 500,000 old francs. - 50,000. - And what's R.V.? - Roadworthy Vehicle? Yes maybe. What do you think? - I read what it says. 500 new francs. - And how much is that? - New francs. That's... 5000. - 5000? You'll get rich. R.V. means Repaired Vehicle. Somebody with an American car, selling for 50,000 francs. - I just called. I have the address. - That's not possible. - Riri, how much does it say? - 500 new francs. I don't give change. - I'm only asking how much it is. - Careful, this is new francs. What are you drinking? My treat. - Coffee with milk, please. - At this hour? - Why? Is the machine still broken? - No, but it will take a bit of time. Do you really want coffee with milk? - Coffee with milk. - That machine must have been a bargain. To your health. To that American car. 22, Avenue de Neuilly. The lady's waiting for you. Take that car. I'm not selling my bike anymore. I'm keeping it. - What's with him? - Go, you. - Are you coming? - I have to make ice cream for Pierrot. There's your brother. - Had a good day, Pierrot? - I sold everything. - What's Marcel doing? - Looking at a car. - And the bike? - Alfred's no longer selling. Your horse is in front of my shop again. Cannibal. Eat this, Charlotte. - Hello, Isabelle. Need anything? - Yes, but there's no rush. - Take your time. - Hello, Isabelle. - I saved these for you. Bonbons. - Thank you. I'll give Charlotte some water and then I have to go. - Can I help? - Do you want to hold the reins? Come here immediately. Aren't you ashamed? - I didn't do anything, mummy. - In the middle of the street. You only want to sell ice cream. I didn't raise you for that. If your father was still alive... Enough, go practice. Maurice, Maurice. - Now what? - Jojo doesn't want to do his homework. Mr Jojo, get your notebooks and your books and get started. - And what do I get? - A kick up the butt. I'm counting... Beaujolais, as always? It's 10 past 5. I'll be back in an hour. Don't get up before then. I'll keep an eye on him. And treat your notebooks better than your hair. - Will you shave me, Lapin? - I can. - Ready. - Almost. I made strawberry too. We don't sell much at night. - And my ice cream cart is out of fashion. - Isabelle doesn't think so. - What's this? - Our car. You're not going to cry, are you? - Did you buy it? And pay it? - Of course. You didn't really pay 50,000 francs for that car. True, 45,000. I had doubts, so they took of 5000. - So many buttons. - About your brother- in- law. - Are you happy with it? - I don't know. I understand her. It's expensive. The insurance alone. - It's been paid. - And the petrol? - There's 1000 francs in there. - That won't get you far. - Does it use a lot? - Only when you drive it. - There are more costs. - Repairs. - The tires. - Alright, we won't keep it. Maybe it's not for us. I thought I was doing you a favour. I wanted to try it out with everybody on board. - Why is it not for us? - None of anybody's business. - We can go for a drive. - If we all move up a bit. - My spot's available. - Shall we? - Let me see if my ice cream is melting. - Give me my coat and close the place. Why aren't you doing anything? Go do your homework. Shaving can wait. The Italian doesn't have a car. - You're closing early. - We're going for a drive. Get your hat. Yes, you're coming with us. Keep an eye on the caf√©. Nice, isn't it? Think of Cinderella's carriage. What's the compression ratio? - Hello, Alfred. - Yes, yes. Bye, guys. Reverse, Marcel. - Posh people going for a drive? - Is your sister posh as well? Very nice, a car. My husband wanted to buy one 30 years ago. A nice one too. But he couldn't. It cost 9000 francs back then. - What did this one cost? - 45,000, grandma. Things have become expensive. - A motor bike wants to take over. - Alfred maybe? - Go faster. - It's the cops. - Are your car papers alright? - The registration isn't in my name. - Hello. You lost this. - My cap. Thank you, officer. - That's very friendly. All that effort. - It was a pleasure, sir. - We're almost out of petrol. - Let's all contribute a bit. - We're 600 short. - That's all we have. - I can't take the petrol out. - I have an idea. Thank you. That'll do. Some people have a hard time. Just buy one. They were all very impressed. - They all want one too. - I can see 43 Cadillacs here. - Are you sure the cover's down? - Do you want me to go down again? - Nice day, isn't it? - I just gave a poodle a haircut. - Do you know that car? - It belongs to a neighbour. - Do you know him well? Does he live here? - Up there. They're gone. They really liked it. Move over. - Are you sure it's not stolen? - Not by me. I paid for it. - 45,000 francs is a lot. - I know. Let's not worry about it. Good night. - They think they're keeping us awake. - Well, they're not. - What a beautiful day. - Enjoy it. A black coffee and a coffee with a lot of milk. I don't want to be a pessimist, but he'll have problems. And you bought it? From Mrs Lucanzas? 22, Avenue Neuilly? Maybe we should go see this lady. What do you think? Look the cover's coming up automatically. And all those buttons. They're taking it with them. If that car's stolen, he could get five years. You're lucky. Unfortunately, all's fine, Balutin. - Why unfortunately? - We liked your car. - Only your registration... - I'll fix it tomorrow. Tomorrow's Sunday. Let's fix it now. - I have to go to the factory. - You can go tomorrow. - I'm already late. - Drive to the station, it'll be fine. Balutin, at least, will be content. Let her in. - Hello, Simone. - Hello, madam. I had you come over, so as not to keep you waiting... for part of the inheritance of my husband, Mr Lucanzas. He wanted to give back something to a secretary who... How do I say? was dedicated and caring. Dedicated and caring. Is that well put? - Cigarette? - No thanks, I don't smoke. One bad habit you don't have. As executrix, I had to sell my husband's American car... and give you the money. I complied with my husband's wishes. The car has been sold. Mr Fachepot, my notary, will give you the cheque. - I'd need the lady to... - You can tell us. Miss Simone Arotout, born in Nogent- le Rotrou... Miss Arotout has to sign a receipt. Isn't that it? Would you mind signing? The undersigned declares... Born in Nogent... The amount of... Using a cheque... Drawn up in Paris... - Do I sign here? - No. Yes. Thank you, Mrs Lucanzas... Miss Arotout... All's fine. The amount might surprise you. My grief prevented me from getting a good deal. I thought as much. 450 new francs? - 45,000 old francs. - That's a whole lot. You think? Good. I thought I sold it at a bad price. - And do I have any appeal? - Does she? You can't appeal the purchase, but you could... - What can I do? - What can she do? Tell us. Legal action is possible, but then we appeal. A cassation appeal, for instance... - That takes ten years. - Fifteen. - Do you want to annul your signature? - Oh, no. At my age one acts lightly. See the lady to the door. The idiot signed. Such sweet revenge. Two hours too late. Were you ill? No, I needed another registration certificate. - A registration certificate? - Viralot? - Do we have visitors today? - No. Didn't you see that car? A beautiful American car. It's mine. Can I see you for a moment? Go back to work. I'll see you later. Has is been checked? It's al fine? Good, thanks. The car's really his. And all paid. I checked it. Not even on credit, but cash. Fine, thanks. Good. - Where does the idiot work? - At the tubing department. So he doesn't work hard. - This is the last time I'm paying you. - Goodbye. But you have to sign this. - What's that? - Social security. - Don't you agree? - The amount's different. - So is the ceiling. - The ceiling? - I mean another ceiling. - Right. - Come on, 8 plus 8? - 16. I'll explain. 0.023% in parts of 20,000... on top of... - Let's be clear. 0.023% in parts of 20,000... on top of... - The released average. That's not all. We then deduct 0.14% from the extra withheld amount... - And that gives a base amount. - In other words... 0.14%... base amount of... - Of which index? - Index 3. - 24 plus 24, quickly. - 48. - What do you want? - This. - Don't you find it interesting? - Yes, I do. Goodbye. I made a mistake. It's not 0.14%, but 0.15%. 697 plus 478, how much is that? HEAD BOOKKEEPER BOOKKEEPER - Goodbye, Slouvak. - Bye, poor Perrignon. Try with Technidur, they might need people. Take bus 189. It'll take you straight there. - The 189? - Yes, it's the last stop. Poor Perrignon. Always the same thing. Capitalists. - They don't have anything. - Always the same thing. - Not at the tubing department either? - No. With five men, we can't put out the candle. Give me. It's quite simple. Take the candle... - Without a reason? - Yes, they just fired me. Did the car have anything to do with it? They wouldn't have been as jealous of Alfred's bike. - What did you say? - Nothing. Thank you, Fernand Raynaud. Our compliments. It's the time of the events... The car parade will be held tomorrow near Choumontelle Castle... under supervision of 'Sport and Beauty'. I am honoured to report about this event... and you will witness the most beautiful women, dogs and cars. - This is only for luxury cars. - Of course. No vans. How much can we win? - The first prize is one million. - Old francs, of course. You can register until this evening with Sporting Automobile Club... 33, Place Vend√¥me. - 33, Place Vend√¥me! You should participate. You're sure to win. - It's so beautiful. - Let's take a picture. And isn't he handsome in his white coat? - Hurry, we'll be late. - Wait, first a picture. Don't move anymore. Smile. Car two is presented by Annique de Morel. Car three, please get ready. Far from the noise of the big city... the car parade has started, a highlight of the season. And now a new participant. Miss Elianne de Monchoix. Elianne de Monchoix is our third participant. - That was Elianne de Monchoix. - Number three of our program. Mrs Alberta de Choisy. - That's a Porsche. - No, that's a Jaguar - It's a Mercedes, isn't it Sophie? - Yes, a 300SL with injection. We continue with participant four. What a beautiful, shiny car. The fourth participant is... Who's number four? - Alberta de Choisy. - She's number four of our program. Those Parisian ladies... Here's... - Miss Sylvia Rubitsch has... - Number five. - Beautiful. - Please. - She's beautiful. - She's way to skinny. - She's very beautiful. - Absolutely. - This is the best so far. - Now comes my sister. Car six, please get ready. Three more and then it's us. Car six. Miss Paulette Perrignon. That's us, guys. We're going back to the studio... - Turn it off, Riri. - It's all over. What a shame, it was so beautiful. That car's bad luck. After you got it, you lost your job and I lost the competition. That dog lost. He cost us a million. - But he does fetch. - Our car's too beautiful. - Then we have to sell it. - I talked to two garage owners. - When? - Yesterday evening, after I got fired. They said I should never have bought such a car. - When we sell we lose two million. - We can't afford that. Still, it wasn't expensive. If we sell it, we have to throw in all our savings. Yes, maybe. Phone, Marcel. - Who? - The people of the competition. - The Sporting Automobile Club? - Something like that, yes. What do they want? - Maybe they want to give you something. - A dog. I've got work. Someone saw the car on TV and wants me to be their driver. - Where to? - Saint- Germain. That's hard from here. Normally, I'd know. But from here... Go straight. - Well? - No, this car isn't for sale. What about my savings? - Where are you going? - I thought I heard something. - I'll get the key. - Isn't it nice together? Well then. No, I really have to check what's going on. - Do you think I'm stupid? - Not at all, but I heard something. - I really have to have a look. - Look well then. I'm entitled to that car. I'll pay 10,000 francs. My wife doesn't want it. - Should I tell her about today? - No blackmail. Open up. I'll open up if you sell. Alright then. - What are you doing? - Going for a drive. Open up. I have the key, by the way. Me too. I used to drive this. - Are you comfortable? - You're not leaving me here. What can I do? I only have the ignition key. Don't leave me here. Don't forget that I'm here. It's only ten o'clock. Maybe he still had to drive somewhere. He would have called. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Quite a party here. - Your brother- in- law hasn't returned. - He's on the road to Saint- Germain. - Only the car. Come, Pierrot. I'm not vindictive. I'll take you. - The three of us? - I've had four people on it. Thank you, Alfred. My poor little bike's happy to do something for your beautiful car. - Push, Pierrot. - If there's a problem, I'll be there. On foot. - The 28th instalment of this serial. - The big investigation. In the dead of night a shadow approached. Hello, handsome. Do you like me? Rejecting the invitation, the inspector bravely walked towards his goal. He was convinced he would conquer the powers of evil and his enemies. Suddenly, at the end of the street... If anybody's there, we'll stab him. - Who's that? - Who said that? It's me. Open up, I need to get out. - What are you doing there, darling? - I fell asleep. - What time is it? - Half past eleven. - At night? - Yes, we were very worried. - Where's the key? - In my pocket. I can't breathe. - We need to see a locksmith. - At this hour? - Does he have to spend the night there? - No, don't leave me here, Paulette. Alright, I'll drive there. Take the hand brake off. Alfred says hello. Here it is. They won't be used to working at this hour. - Who's there? - A customer. - What do you want? - We're looking for a locksmith. - At this hour? - It's urgent. My husband's asleep. Come back tomorrow morning. - It's about opening a trunk. - It can wait. There's somebody in there. Bravo. - And? - Nothing. Stay in the car. Alfred that way and me this way. That should work. And don't say there's someone in the trunk. I'm here, darling. Very close to you. Almost on your shoulder. - It smells nice. Do you smell anything? - Yes, petrol. - There they are. - Is it them? Answer. No, its a bus. With wedding guests. Long live the bride and the groom. Nice car. - What are they saying? - They like our car. - What did you say? - Nothing, I'm drinking something. - What are you drinking? - Lemonade. - Nice. - Yes, cold. - So the little fridge works well. - Yes, it's very cold. - I'd like some too. - There's Pierrot. - This gentleman can help us. - That's very nice. - Thank you, sir... - Let him work. The trunk's at the back. Don't say there's somebody in there. - Is that the locksmith? - Why do you ask? I was telling my sister. I don't have all my tools. And I don't want to damage such a nice car. - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - I can't stand it any longer. You're a nice bunch. Be patient. Where's my lamp? Strange spot... A chock. - In the trunk. - But we have to open it first. I'll find something. Tell Marcel to shut up. Darling? Darling? Don't say anything. I'll explain later. Let's see. This time, it will work. - Help. Murderer. - What's with the locksmith? Where's he going? Why did he close the trunk? - He's going to tell the neighbourhood. - Are we going back? We're going back home to sleep. Finally we find a locksmith and then he closes the trunk again. They're gone. Did I get out of bed for nothing? Where's the lock? There. - Are we home? - We're out of petrol. I have a can in the trunk. - We've got no money. - A shame. I have 500 francs. Go back to sleep. We'll be back with money, petrol, rolls and a locksmith. - Hang in there, darling. - We could be back in two hours. - Don't you mind the detour? - It's only a little complication. - Problems? - Yes, this will be complicated. Stay relaxed, partner. I know I am. What a great car. How fast does it go? - Here it is. - He's gone. - Do you mind taking us home? - I don't mind, I'm pissed off! Five litres of petrol, please. No wash. Five litres of petrol. I don't want a wash. I want five litres of petrol. Do I have to get angry? I'm sorry, sir. It's a misunderstanding. Will that do? Will that do? - Not with that suit. - It's his. It doesn't fit. - Did you find him? - No. - This fits. - Yes, that's mine. - He said I could keep it. - He's the director. - You will be reimbursed, no? - We're offering this regardless. Your things: a knife, a handkerchief... your papers, pliers and a tape measure. Your car has been dried, waxed and checked. It was our pleasure. We also threw in those five litres of petrol. No, no. That's on the house as well. Thanks for everything. Our director called your wife and reassured her. Your keys. Such a car but no driver. What times do we live in? Jerome, to the club. It's really you. Perrignon. It's me, Chauveau. Chauveau, your army pal. You called me Chow- chow. You seem to be doing alright. Well dressed. Cigar... Old fellow, just when I needed you. I'm a bit short for cash. If it's not too much to ask, would you have 5000 francs for me? It would be a great help. Give me your address and I'll come and see you. Yes, but... excuse me. Perrignon, it's me, Chauveau. You called me Chow- chow. Your army buddy. Perrignon. Drop dead. Reverse. You're blocking the road. A reception at the embassy. Keep going. I have to go left, officer. I'm not part of it. This way, sir. - Can I see your invitation? - I don't have one. - He forgot his invitation. - Didn't you see his car? - Who can I say? Your name? - Mr Perrignon. Good that you're here. Colonel. I say. How are you, Mr... The buffet is that way. Little villain of mine. You were not at Willy's last night. I thought you were Jean- Loup Menzagol. I'm confused. Say, pal. I hardly know anybody anymore at events like this. Cigar? Here we can talk in quiet, minister. I have to discuss something with my colleagues. I wanted to talk to you because I have to go to that opening. I'll have to say something there. Did you prepare anything, Houche? Of course not. Have your experts arrived? These are Mr Bavermont, Mr Chicanzin and Mr Bernapi√©. Fine, gentlemen. Sit down. Maybe you can say something about changes to social security. - Very good. How about that? - I don't know. Me neither. I can't remember the deductions. That's what we have these gentlemen for. It's 0.023%. 0.023% in parts of 20,000 on top of the released average. 0.023%, minister. - Thank you. And you are? - Mr Perrignon. I can't get up. I have back pain. I had a bad night. - 0.023% in parts of 20,000. - On top of the released average. What's happening? I'm very sorry. - He can't stand up straight. - Do something. - It's his back. - He must be in great pain. Houche, where is he? Mr Perrignon, where are you? - Maybe under the couch. - Don't walk over him. It's all my fault. Is that you? - Impressive. - A two- way mirror. - What are you doing there? - Suddenly I was here. Poor man, I'll call someone. I'm very happy you're doing better. I'd never have forgiven myself. Look after him well. 0.023% is not worth mentioning. - There is also an additional deduction. - Of how much? Mr Bavermont doesn't have his paperwork with him. It's at my place. In Etampes. We deduct 0.14% to reach the base amount. - Do you know Mr Perrignon? - I'd say so, minister. You're of great value. - Where can I reach you? - At Riri's. - Plaine 24- 70. - Write down. That's his number. Plaine 24- 70. He always likes new faces. The car of the minister of commerce. Do you know Mr Perrignon? Do you know Mr Perrignon? Hello, my friend. It was great. - Can I have someone bring you home? - No, I'm by car. Is that yours? That's magnificent. A luxury toy. We're big children. I bet it's comfortable. Do you want to try it? So many buttons. What's this? That's the wiper. It's not adjusted properly. Everything else works fine. - Do you want to try it? - Please. I have an opening. Cutting a ribbon. Let's go together. Houche, follow us. That's my friend, that's Perrignon. The minister's next to him. He does have his contacts. Officer, do you know who was sitting next to the minister? - I don't know him. - I do. That's Perrignon. P- e- r- r- i- g- n- o- n. That's my old army pal. I'm Chauveau. He called me Chow- chow. If you mention Perrignon in your thing... also add that he's a bastard. Is it there? Minister, it's a great honour to me and our company. Thank you. France is France everywhere. Let me introduce to you my department heads. Mr Diamant. Mr Berger. Mr Jobart and Mr Viralot. That's Mr Perrignon. We used to need four men for this machine. Now, one specialist's enough. It doesn't run very well. - Is it the clutch? - It doesn't have one. I made it stall. But I'll start it again. - I didn't touch anything. - I'll have a look. - Is the engine in the back? - No, that's the trunk. I remember. - Is it serious? - I don't know yet. I don't think I can be of much help and they're waiting for me. So I have to leave you. Call me if there's a problem. I'll give you my direct number. That's easier. Silly, I have no money on me. Can you lend me some for a cab? That's what happens when there's always a car waiting for you. - I also have a telephone coin. - Only one? - Isn't that enough? - More than enough. Taxi! Thank you. My car's there. It was there just now. Can I make a phone call? Hello, can I talk to the minister? Magali, look. Someone thinks this is a parking spot. - Aren't you going to wait? - I have to go through the lock before 7. He can come and get it. That'll teach him. Marcel's here. - What happened? - You won't believe it. - Where did you get this? - It was given to me. - Why didn't you call? - I called the minister. - Because my car's been stolen. - And then you called a minister. The poor darling has a screw loose. He's been in the trunk too long. Marcel, telephone. The minister of commerce. See? Unbelievable. - Thank you. - That's what the police are for. But I wanted to ask you a favour in return. You know everything. Melbourne, isn't that the capital of Australia? Jojo, pass me your geography book. The capital of Australia... No, that's not Melbourne... It's Canberra. - Canberra. It's Canberra. - Could be. You know Australia of course? It's a continent in the southern hemisphere, 7,704,000 km2... surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Such knowledge. Is the barber here? Say Lapin, will you finish it? Mr Perrignon's talking to the minister. Goodbye, minister. Thank you. All the roads will be checked. We have to stop all white American cars. I'll think of you when I'm playing tonight. And me of you. I'll watch your picture all night. - Do you still have it? - Yes, you know where? Guess. - No idea. - On the lid of the strawberry ice cream. AT THE MINISTER'S FRIENDS - Thank you. - That's what neighbours are for. I have a cousin who wants to work with the mail service. Mrs Zoutin, I'll discuss it with Mr Perrignon. Next. You have beautiful hands. Where's Marcel? The owner. - Do you know him? - He's stuck in the trunk. - Does he sleep on board? - Are you there, Marcel? Marcel, I found your car. - Where? - In the Seine. In the lock, on a barge. Come. What are you doing? What's it to you? That's not your car, is it? This is pure provocation. I'll get the owner with this brush. - What are you doing? - Painting. No, careful. I heard something. - Keep an eye on things. - No, the cops... Stop it. Take this. We'll show them. I'll do the other side. Paint over the entire length: U.S. Go Home. With an H. Go on. Over the entire length. Warn me if you see police. Over the entire length. U.S... - It's my car. - No, it's mine. This isn't my idea. Where did that guy go? It's really my car. Perrignon... Marcel. - Excuse me, Monsieur Viralot. - Viralot? Something wrong with that? Viralot's a normal name. There are plenty of people with that name. My brother's name's Viralot. - You have a brother? - What's it to you? He's my twin. He works in a factory... In a factory where they make... They make... Right, he works in the industry. Where were we? Heavy industry... Where were we... Perrignon... Marcel... Address... Confiscated. Ask Inspector Balutin or his colleague. They were in my car. They're following someone in Roubaix. Following in Roubaix. Following in Roubaix. - Both of them? - Are you asking the questions here? Call the widow. She sold me the car. That stupid woman. Gruau, call her. Maillot 73- 42. Telephone. - Mrs Lucanzas. - Is Mrs Lucanzas in? For you, dear Edwige. It's the police station of Plaine Saint- Denis. It's about that car again. Hello, Mrs Lucanzas? Do you know Mr Marcel Perrignon? - He says he knows you. - I don't know him. - She's always so confused. - He says you're always like this. He's crazy. Mrs Lucanzas? They may throw me in jail They don't believe me. - She's drunk. - She hung up. Call the minister. Call the minister of commerce and mention my name. Wouldn't you rather have me call the pope? Vatican 000... - Right, in the cell. - I know him well. I really know the minister of commerce well. Chauveau, we're meeting again. Sir, ask him. He knows me and my car. - Say, Chauveau. Do you know this person? - Never seen before. - He's my army pal. - It's very bad manners to lie. Ugly fellow. - Do you know Mr Marcel Perrignon? - There. Look how ugly. He's a friend of the minister. I've got a letter here. Dear friend, I can't reach you. Call me. The minister of commerce. I'll call the telephone exchange. - From the minister. - The ministry of commerce, please. Perrignon speaking. Can I talk to the minister of commerce? He has already left? I'll call back tomorrow morning. - Did Chauveau do anything serious? - No, just vagrancy. He's an old army pal of mine. I'm counting on you, Viralot. - Good evening, sir. - Sir. Thanks, madam. - What are you doing here? - I sent them. They were with us. - How did you know I was here? - I heard you'd been arrested... Say, Grougnache and Laribotte, do I owe this to you? - To Grougnache, chief. - The bloody gall... Both of you, Grougnache... Laribotte... I feel very guilty. You spoke to me on the phone about the American car. I pulled a prank on you. To the cell. Chief of Police, it was really a joke. And an irresistible one at that. I'm still laughing. Four, five... That care gave us so many problems. But we've also benefited from it. You know a minister now. But I'm the only one with such a car. If all our friends had one... I told them it's not our car. Mr Perrignon? The French police aren't crazy. - Which car is yours? - None of them. I've already got it back. - Couldn't you have told us? - You didn't ask anything. Go on. All out. This is unacceptable. I really wanted to say hello. It's nice here. A real find. You have parking problems too, now that everyone's got a car. - I owed you some money. - There was no rush. I've come to say goodbye. I'm going to Australia. - Canberra? - I'll be ambassador. I'm leaving now. - What a pity. - I'd have preferred the US myself. - Can I say goodbye to your wife? - You can. Paulette. The minister. - Hello, minister. - It's an honour. Berthe, Mr minister. I won't hold you up any longer. Nice place you have here. - It was an honour to know you. - Likewise. - He's nice, isn't he? - And a handsome man He returned the 500. Mr Perrignon, our sincere apologies. Tell me... I had to buy 5 litres of petrol. I paid for the petrol. - With the compliments of the station. - Thank you, gentlemen. Not them, I did... We have manners. Excuse me. Thank you, sir. Gracious lady, please accept this bouquet on behalf of the constabulary. - So eloquent. - I know. On a day like today, it's my treat. To France, guys. And to the minister. - Have a drink, Pierrot. - No. Could you move your car a bit? Let me. There's been an accident. I put it in reverse. - The horse isn't hurt. - Poor Pierrot. Did you hurt yourself? And your horse? - I wanted to have an ice cream. - I'm sorry, Pierrot. This gives me an idea. - How much is that? - No, I'm paying. When I'll have 50,000 francs, I'll buy your bike. A modest victory.
