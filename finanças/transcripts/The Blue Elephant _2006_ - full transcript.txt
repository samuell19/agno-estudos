It’s a shame Phu Pha didn't have a chance to see his boy. AYUTTHAYA, 1569 Archers, loose! Wow! That was awesome! He's strong as an elephant. How great was that? So, who’s next? - He means you. - No, he means you! - You! - No, you! No worries, come on, both of you! Look out! Marong’s here! That’s called a man’s game! Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Ribbit! Hand over my ball! Did you get that, or do I need to speak frog language? Ribbit. Ribbit. You’re asking for it. Wow! You really think you can dodge me? You! Come on, let’s go somewhere else. Nice landing. Can we see it in slow motion? Where are you going, coward? He’s really mad now. Are you deaf? Can’t run to Daddy, can you? What, did I hit a soft spot? You’re a coward just like your father. Let’s get out of here. Marong! Let’s get him! Where is it? Who did that? Hey, a fight! Excuse me! Whose match is it? That’s it, throw a hook! Left, left! Stand ground! There! There! There! There! There! There! Get him! Throw a hook! That’s it! That’s a lot of clay, Saeng Da. It’s Khan Kluay’s favorite. He can’t get enough of it. He’s a growing boy. He’s becoming more and more like his father. He’s like his clone, really. Please! Can we not talk about him? Why not? It’s been ages, hasn’t it? There he is. Speak of the devil. Are you hungry? I have some clay for you. What’ve you been up to today? Nothing, Mom. Here you are, boy! I almost lost you! You were great! Outnumbered by four to one, but you were... What happened to your face? Didn’t I tell you not to get yourself in trouble? That hurts, Mom. Good, let that be a lesson. Don’t get into any more trouble. Miss, you must see for yourself. He’s a fighter all right. I wonder who his father is. And who are you to be asking about my son? I thought you’d never ask. One for you, one for you, I have enough for everyone. My name’s Jidrid. JIDRID 01-2591 Your high-speed homing pigeon. The finest of Ayutthaya’s Battalion for three consecutive years, thank you. You name a battle or any important event, I was there! It’s a ghost elephant! Watch that mouth. Is it true what you just said? Then you must know the great warrior Phu Pha. Phu Pha? Why, of course! Wait. Now, where did I put it? They’re everywhere! What’s all the commotion? Soldiers! They’re everywhere! Do you want to go see, Grandma? This isn’t a game, Marong! Prepare to migrate, the soldiers are coming! What? Soldiers? I must go then. So long, kid! See you later! Wait! Don’t go yet! Soldiers are so cool, don’t you think, Dad? Stop talking nonsense and get going. Mom, Mom! Who’s Phu Pha? Not now, honey. Let’s get going. What a bummer. This is no fun. Cool it, I have a plan for tonight. Let’s call it Operation 4701. 4701? Awesome! Mom. Mom. Who’s Phu Pha? It’s late, honey. Get some rest. No, Mom. Please tell me. - Please. - We’ll talk another time. We have an early day tomorrow. He’s my father, isn’t he? Why are you always like this when we talk about Dad? He’s done something bad. He’s a coward, isn’t he? That’s why you won’t talk about him? Khan Kluay, why would you say that? Your father was a hero. Then why isn’t he here, with us? Doesn’t he love us? Of course, he does. But he was taken by human... before you were born. We can go save him! - The humans are close by. - No, honey. Don’t you go near them! It’s very dangerous, understand? How come? I’ve already lost your father, I can’t lose you, too. But don’t you miss him? Of course I do. But you know what? He hasn’t gone far at all. See? These are his eyes, and his trunk. These ears, too. And here. And here. Here, too. And here! Khan Kluay, I love you. I love you, too. Go to sleep. Mom, I’m going to find Dad. Drunk already? Why’s Ayutthaya whisky so light? - Can’t match Taungoo Empire whisky. - Maybe it’s a fake. - I miss home. - Me, too. I want to go home! I miss my wife! - Give me a kiss! - Hey, keep it down! You’ll get us all in trouble! What is it? Damn you... Yes, sir! Nothing out of the ordinary, sir! "Nothing out of the ordinary"? Wifey, listen up, I miss you! - I want to see you so bad... - Here you go! The operation’s not finished, and you’re already drunk. Eat some knuckle for a change. Don’t make me throw you in jail. - Come on, give me a kiss! - This fool! Get him out! - You’re always like this when drunk. - Let me go! Excuse me, are there any elephants around here? Elephants? - Have you seen any? - I’m not sure. Why do you ask? - I’m looking for my dad. - Hey, keep it down! There are no elephants here! Go look up ahead! There’s no need to scold him. Operation 4701 is the best! Go all out, everyone! - Hey. - What? Elephant, elephant, elephant Have you ever seen an elephant? It is extremely big With a great long nose called... Hey, don’t mock our ancestors. - Hey, check this out! - That looks so yummy! Left, right, left, right. Why are we not in sync? Hey. What’s your name? Are you Phu Pha? Who are you? How dare you come in here? My name is Khan Kluay. I’m looking for my father. His name is Phu Pha! Do you know him? Go! Get lost! I’m just asking if you know him. - What’s that noise? - Go see what's happening! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! An elephant! Get it! Get that elephant! - Get the elephant! - Get the elephant! - Get the elephant! - Get the elephant! - Get the elephant! - Get the elephant! Quickly! It’s only one elephant! That’s great. Yes, just wonderful. - Khan Kluay? - Khan Kluay? What’s he doing here? I don’t know. That was a close one. Wait for me! - Care... - Careful? - Quick, quick! - Hey, if you’re stopping, say so! It’s raining elephants! Seize them! Hey, little guy. It’s all right, I won’t hurt you. Your Royal Highness, be careful. It might be dangerous. It’s all right. There, there. Your Royal Highness. Might you have seen a wild elephant come through here? - Take care of the elephant. - Yes, Your Highness. It must be in there. Are you sure, sir? What are you so scared of? Your mouth stinks. A wild elephant is on the loose. For Your Royal Highness’s safety, we ask for your permission to enter your tent. - Come on, let’s go. - Stop at once! - You have no right to enter! - What? Have you forgotten why you are here? I may be held captive, but I still am a prince! If you choose to disregard that, then so be it! - Shall we, sir? - Don’t just stand there! - You’re bigger, you go first. - Fall back! And I thought you had it in you. Where are you going, honey? Come over here and let me snuggle. - Elephant! - The elephant! Go get it! - Go quickly! - It went into the forest! It’s too fast! This way! - Which way? - Over there! Go, go! - This way! - There, it fell down there! - It fell down. - Sure did! Khan Kluay! Khan Kluay, where are you? Khan Kluay! Are you hurt? Are you okay? Does your leg hurt? Wait up. Here, eat this. Thank you. You’re... I’m Shaba Kaew. What about you? Khan Kluay. Your herd’s this way? Yep. Right over this hill. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Grandma! Where did everybody go? Mom! I’m back! What are you going to do? I’ll go look for my mom. How? I don’t know. I’ll just keep looking. I’ll find her eventually. Not in this state, you’re not. How about you come stay with us? You can go looking for her when you get better. My father knows every inch of this forest. He might be able to help. Khan Kluay, how do you like sugar cane? Not really. I don’t like sweets. What? Really? Well, I love it! Though I can’t have too much of it. I’m starting to gain weight. My father always brings back sugar cane. There he is! Daddy, I’m back! That is her dad? Come on, Khan Kluay! - What are they barking at? - Where did that elephant come from? It’s an elephant! The crops will be ruined! Quickly, follow it! Wow! Feels like we’re on vacation! Vacation? Can’t you see we’re being held captive? So he is the captive from Ayutthaya that grandfather is taking in? We mustn’t let our guard down, Your Royal Highness. Go on! Hold on. Come on! Careful of the rope! Mangkud! Come here, quick! How are you feeling, Khan Kluay? Why do you want to know? Let me go! Be patient. You should let your leg heal first. Then my father will help you look for your mom. You call that human your father? Of course. He’s the one who raised me. He raised you to work for him. Why do you say that? Human and elephants are friends. Then what’s that? We can never be friends! I guess you won’t listen to anything I have to say. Well, I did end up this way, all thanks to you! Just leave me alone from now on! Fine! I won’t be bothering you anymore! Here you go. Mommy, carry me! Khan Kluay, I love you. Mom. Mommy. Hey. So, how is it? You’re a smart-looking one. I’ve never seen one like you before. Take a few steps for me, will you? You’re all better now, aren’t you? Good, you are better. I did tend to it pretty well. Hey, everyone, get inside, quick! Them again? You stay put. If they see you, they’ll take you. Help! Bring it here! You lazy bum! Hurry it up! - Put it down, fatso! - Speed it up! You’re going to make us late! Yes, we’re going to be late. What? Is this all you have? You guys, go check! I hope you didn't hide anything else from me. This is all we have, sir. There’s been a drought, so we haven’t had much to live on. - What’s over there? - What’s that? Sir! They tricked us! You asked for it, old man. Pull! Remember this, everything on this land belongs to Taungoo Empire. Let’s go. Take everything. Leave nothing, not even a grain of rice. - Yes, sir! - Take everything! It should be around here. Mister! Mister! Is that you? It’s me, don’t you remember? It’s you! Perfect timing. Do you know where old man Mahout lives? What was that? Hey, wait up! No! Stay away, kid. Back off! No! Those gangster civets! Get them! Just like that! Yes! You deserve this! Yes, you do! Help me! Khan Kluay! Shaba Kaew, hang in there! Get lost! Go away! Go! Follow them! Grandpa! Grandpa! So, where did it hurt? I’ve been looking all over for you! I brought you a letter from Ayutthaya. Lay her down gently. Why are you standing there? Let’s go home, kid. Are you full now? Can you tell me more about Phu Pha? You showed some skills this afternoon. With a little more training, you’d get in the troops for sure. Save that for later. I want to know more about my father. What? Phu Pha’s your father? Come to think of it, you do resemble him. Come here, let me see. Do you know where he is? He’s the number one war elephant. Naturally he’d be in the palace. Can you take me to see him? It’s not easy to get into the palace. Unless you’re a war elephant yourself. What would I have to do to be one? I want everyone to train hard and listen carefully to what I say. If the Palace raises the levies, we will answer them at once! Yes, sir! A little more. That’s it! No matter how far my destination is No matter what obstacles I have to face We will train hard We will never let any obstacles hold us We just need to hang in there Hang on, just hang in there We will get to where we want to be Hang on! There’s someone beside you Always ready to give you support To help you in time of need To give you a smile When you’ve reached your destination We just need to hang in there Hang on, just hang in there We will get to where we want to be Hang on! Hang in there Just hang on Just hang, hang, hang in there And we will get to where we want to be What did you wish for? I wish to see my father and mother, so we can finally be a family. What’s wrong, Shaba Kaew? At least you have parents to search for. I’m an orphan. I don’t even know what they look like. It’s all right. You have me now. Right? I’ll protect you. He’s got good moves, this lad. Oh, my lady I’ve come to... What! Do you need help, miss? I know my way around here. Here for a delivery? Are there any for me? What happened? Good news from Ayutthaya. Let’s hear it. It is time for change! - Looks fun, doesn’t it? - Yeah. Let’s see what’s inside. What? This is all, sir! It broke. They never learn, do they? Do a thorough search! Seize everything! Over there. There they are. Get out of there! What? Elephant! - Elephant! - Elephant! Hold it. Let’s make a run for it! Let Bumbim loose! Yes, sir! Take that! Take that! Who’s in trouble now? He’s got a gun! Don’t be afraid. I’ll protect you. Stay back! Or the old man dies! Don’t try me! You have something to say? Did you think we’d always bow our heads to you? You think you’re so brave! Once Taungoo Empire hears about this, you’d have nowhere to go. Where have you been? Ayutthaya is free now! You should know that King Naresuan has declared independence. Go back to where you came from! Bumbim! That hurts! My bum! You haven’t seen the last of me! Well, I’ll be waiting! Come on, it’s getting dark. Go on, don’t worry about us! Promise you’ll be back safely. You, too. Take care of yourself while I’m away. It’s time to get going, lovebirds. All right, let’s get going! - Have a safe trip. - Good luck! Hurry back! Khan Kluay! I hope you find your father! It's in musth state. Please be careful, Your Royal Highness. This is good. Prepare the troops! I will destroy Ayutthaya to pieces! Ayutthaya is really as big as they say. It’s almost like heaven, isn’t it? This is nothing. It’s much more elegant inside. - Really? - Really! I’ll show you around after the selection. Go on, get inside. All the way in. There’s more in line back there. You’ll see. - My elephant will definitely win. - Hey! What’s going on? I knew that I’d see you guys here. You came too? Wait and see my Boonreung. Those elephants don’t stand a chance. What a show-off. Do your best, Khan Kluay! Show them what we’ve got! Go on, deep breaths. Fourteen feet across. Fourteen feet across. Nine feet tall. Trunk, five feet. Let’s try... How long can you stretch that? "It’s time to select the strongest elephant that fits royal criteria, one that will be entitled a Royal Elephant for the king." The first challenge is the test of strength, where the elephants must lift a set of logs. Five feet. Eight feet. Six feet six inches. Go, boy! You go, boy! Go on, boy! Two yards! You wait and see. What did I tell you? New elephants, report to the east gate! Hey! Watch where you’re going! Where exactly are they taking us? Saeng Da, this way! Don’t get separated! These youngsters are quite fit, aren’t they? "Now for the final round of our competition. The elephants must push this large pile of logs for 131 yards." Not too late to give up, geezer. Go! Come on, Khan Kluay! You can do it! You’re doing great! Khan Kluay! Khan Kluay! Khan Kluay! What the... Restrain it! Saeng Da! Khan Kluay! Mom! Mom! It’s really you! Mom! - Mom. - Khan Kluay. Is it really you? Are you hurt? - Mom! - Khan Kluay! - Mom! - Khan Kluay! Khan Kluay! Mom! No! Don’t do it! He’s on rampage! Forward! Calm down, lad! Mom! Hey! He’s mine! What are you doing? I’ve chosen him to be my Royal Elephant. I am now ready to take on Taungoo Empire. I am ready to sacrifice my life for our kingdom! For our freedom and our peace! Mom, are you hurt? I’m all right. Khan Kluay, can I ask you something? What is it? Let’s go home, honey. Please. Hey! Little fellow! Now, where is that elephant? Where is he? They’re getting ready for the war. Come on! This way! Quick, we’re almost there! Khan Kluay, you promised. We will return home once we’ve found your father. Khan Kluay. Are you listening? Yes? Quit talking. Come on! - Here? - Yes, the Royal Elephants’ Quarter. Your father should be here. Father? Is that you? Father. Phu Pha? I’ve not heard that name in a long time. Come closer. You are his son? You look exactly like him. And you must be Saeng Da. Phu Pha and I have gone to war together. Do you know where I can find him? Follow me. So this is the Hall of Heroes? When Taungoo Empire invaded us... your father and I led the troops out to fight them. The great elephant that led enemy troops was as enormous. Its eyes and trunk as red as fire. It reeked of its thirst for blood. I couldn’t move an inch... putting His Majesty in danger. It was Phu Pha who sacrificed his life to save me. And I still regret it. Dad. He’s gone. Phu Pha. You promised me. Let’s go, my son. Wait just a minute! Don’t forget that you are now the Royal Elephant. So what? He’ll just end up dead in the battle field. Let him go! For any warrior, it matters not how long we live. What matters is the legacy we leave behind. Phu Pha may be gone... but his bravery lives on. Take it. It belonged to your father. Presenting the Royal Elephant! There goes my head. Presenting the Royal Elephant! Your Majesty! May I say... It’s just that my elephant... The elephant... There he is, Your Majesty! You’re here! You almost got me in trouble. King Naresuan the Great led 100,000 men into battle on 18 January 1592, the year of the Dragon. The clouds had formed the shape of the tiered umbrella in the South. It circled clockwise and pointed towards the North. Bring him home, Phu Pha. My brave soldiers... do not fear the enemy! The fewer we are, the greater our victory will be! Any blood spilled today will not be a display of power! It will be to get rid of the enemy who took our land! Today, we fight to drive them out! To protect this land for our children and their children after them! Attack! Fire! Fire! Fire! You want a piece of me? You’re asking for it! That was close. Thanks, lad. Grand Prince of Taungoo Empire! Why are you hiding under the shade of that tree? Come fight me with pride... and not trouble the troops! Make way! Make way! Make way! Make way! Make way! Make way! Make way! The great one, if you give up now... you will have given up on yourself. Stand with me. With your bravery and my strength... we can change the fate of this land! The Grand Prince of Taungoo Empire has passed away! After the elephant battle, Taungoo Empire did not dare return to Ayutthaya. Which allowed peace for the Kingdom for over 100 years. Khan Kluay was anointed Lord Protector of Siam... whose heroic duties remain honored to today. Marong, this one isn’t working. Just do as I say! In the deepest jungles There lived many animals King of the jungle, the elephant Turned into the Royal Elephant Selfless and grateful With such determination and bravery He searched for his missing father And one day did our kingdom a great deed Khan Kluay the elephant The war elephant Fought hard in the war Unafraid of anyone Khan Kluay the elephant His Majesty’s elephant Who brought victory In the elephant battle In the deepest jungles There lived many animals King of the jungle, the elephant Turned into the Royal Elephant King Naresuan’s Royal Elephant All the enemies surrendered To his mighty power Little Khan Kluay became The Royal Elephant Freeing Siam from Taungoo Empire Khan Kluay the elephant The war elephant Fought hard in the war Unafraid of anyone Khan Kluay the elephant His Majesty’s elephant Who brought victory In the elephant battle The heavens must have sent him there And the land must have added his bravery Water always gave him support The fortunate elephant His Majesty’s Elephant Whose purpose was to save the Kingdom Selfless and grateful With such determination and bravery He searched for his missing father And one day did our kingdom a great deed Khan Kluay the elephant The war elephant Fought hard in the war Unafraid of anyone Khan Kluay the elephant His Majesty’s elephant Who brought victory In the elephant battle Khan Kluay the elephant The war elephant Fought hard in the war Unafraid of anyone Khan Kluay the elephant His Majesty’s elephant Brought victory to King Naresuan On the cross-road Unknowing which way to go Knowing the path in front of you Will not be an easy one Will you choose the path For your own happiness?
