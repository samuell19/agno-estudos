JULY 26 at 6:00 a.m. on July 26th, 1945. at 6:00 a.m. on July 26th, 1945. DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: MINISTER'S OFFICE FOREIGN MINISTER TOGO FOREIGN MINISTER TOGO This could be an opportunity... DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATSUMOTO DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATSUMOTO Yes, it is considerably different from their Cairo Declaration. DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATSUMOTO DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATSUMOTO It no longer demands absolute and It no longer demands absolute and unconditional surrender, but presents... ...in eight articles, specific conditions for the establishment of peace. Therefore... Yes, I am aware of the implications... ...but the armed forces, and in particular... ...the Army, will never accept it. JULY 27 JULY 27 On the next day, July 27th...

PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: CONFERENCE ROOM PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: CONFERENCE ROOM ...the cabinet met to discuss the Potsdam Declaration. ...the cabinet met to discuss the Potsdam Declaration. At present, the Soviet Union is acting as our emissary to the Allies. Until we hear from them, we shouldn't reject the declaration outright. I believe that it's in our best interest to be patient. No one opposed the Foreign Minister's counsel. It was decided that a "wait and see" policy would be adopted. But disagreements arose about how to present this decision to the public. WELFARE MINISTER OKADA WELFARE MINISTER OKADA As the Declaration has been made public overseas, word of it... As the Declaration has been made public overseas, word of it... ...will soon reach the people. Thus, we must quickly make a statement. CABINET INFORMATION BUREAU DIRECTOR SHIMOMURA CABINET INFORMATION BUREAU DIRECTOR SHIMOMURA If we wait too long before making our response... CABINET INFORMATION BUREAU DIRECTOR SHIMOMURA CABINET INFORMATION BUREAU DIRECTOR SHIMOMURA ...there's a danger that we'll be perceived as being indecisive. ...there's a danger that we'll be perceived as being indecisive. MINISTER OF WAR: GENERAL ANAMI MINISTER OF WAR: GENERAL ANAMI If we must announce it, If we must announce it, then we must also completely reject it! We have not accepted this "Potsdam Declaration." And thus, if we do not emphasize our opposition to it... ...we run the risk of implying that we accept it. Such an implication would deal a crushing blow to... ...military and general public morale. The cabinet meeting was thrown to confusion. Knowing that total secrecy was impossible, they opted to exercise prudence. It was decided not to announce any official opinion. Newspapers were instructed to downplay the Declaration. PRIME MINISTER SUZUKI PRIME MINISTER SUZUKI They were not going to object if it was assumed... They were not going to object if it was assumed... ...that the administration was ignoring the Declaration. On this, they were unanimous. The newspapers soft-pedaled the Potsdam Declaration. Some of them even ridiculed it. For the most part, it was ignored by the public. ICHIGAYADAI BLUFF, TOKYO: ARMY STAFF HEADQUARTERS ICHIGAYADAI BLUFF, TOKYO: ARMY STAFF HEADQUARTERS But front-line military personnel... ICHIGAYADAI BLUFF, TOKYO: ARMY STAFF HEADQUARTERS ICHIGAYADAI BLUFF, TOKYO: ARMY STAFF HEADQUARTERS ...began to inquire as to why... ...began to inquire as to why... ...there had been no explicit denouncement of the Potsdam Declaration. Although the public had been left in the dark... ...the 272,000 troops serving on the front lines... ...dispersed throughout Asia and the Pacific... ...through military transmissions, radio, and other means of communication... ...had already become well-informed about the Potsdam Declaration. MINISTER OF WAR'S OFFICE MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: MAJOR HATANAKA MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: MAJOR HATANAKA Your Excellency, MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: MAJOR HATANAKA MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: MAJOR HATANAKA how can our men hold the line under these circumstances? how can our men hold the line under these circumstances? I know. However... we face a grave national crisis. We must not act recklessly. I expect each of you to follow my lead, whether it be in advance or retreat. Is this understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE OFFICE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE OFFICE The front lines will waver? Yes, sir. If we continue to remain silent about this Declaration... ...it will greatly affect the morale of our officers... ...which will make it difficult for them to hold their positions. PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: MEETING HALL PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: MEETING HALL The administration, accepting the Army's advice... PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: MEETING HALL PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: MEETING HALL ...decided that though it would not officially respond ...decided that though it would not officially respond to the Potsdam Declaration... ...it would present Japan's position... ...by answering questions from the press. Thus, Prime Minister Suzuki held a press conference. He stated: "Since the Potsdam Declaration is only a rehash of the Cairo Declaration... ...we do not attach any importance to it." But as he replied to questions from reporters... ...as he repeatedly replied by saying, "we do not attach any importance to it..." ...he finally used the word "mokusatsu," which means "to remain in wise silence." I see no need to reply any further. The newspapers changed their editorial position... ...and widely commented on the Potsdam Declaration... ...and that the lack of official comment about it had been deliberate. News of this soon spread around the world. In foreign countries, the word "mokusatsu‚Äù was translated as "ignoring." It was eventually reported to mean "rejection." As a result, public opinion in the U.S. and Great Britain hardened against Japan. On August 6th, the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. HIROSHIMA HIROSHIMA 200,000 lives were snuffed out in a single moment. 200,000 lives were snuffed out in a single moment. The U.S. had warned that, if Japan refused to accept the Potsdam Declaration... ...then "the alternative for Japan will be prompt and utter destruction." That warning had become a reality. It was stated that the atomic bomb would have a revolutionary effect on warfare... ...and if Japan did not surrender at once... ...then more Japanese targets would be utterly destroyed. SOVIET FRONTIER SOVIET FRONTIER Two days later, on August 8th, the Soviet Union entered the war. Two days later, on August 8th, the Soviet Union entered the war.

IMPERIAL PALACE COMPOUND: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER IMPERIAL PALACE COMPOUND: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER At the underground air-raid shelter beneath the Imperial Palace Library... IMPERIAL PALACE COMPOUND: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER IMPERIAL PALACE COMPOUND: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER ...a discussion was held by the leaders of the war effort. ...a discussion was held by the leaders of the war effort. It began as follows... In light of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the entry of the Soviets into the war... ...it has become impossible to continue fighting. I believe that we have no recourse but to accept the Potsdam Declaration. However, I would like to hear from each of you. With gloomy countenances, the group sat in silence for a while. MINISTER OF THE NAVY: ADMIRAL YONAI MINISTER OF THE NAVY: ADMIRAL YONAI We can't resolve anything by falling silent! We can't resolve anything by falling silent! Each of us must express his opinions. Each in his own way, they began stating their views. But there was much confusion and dissension, and no consensus could be discerned. And while the meeting dragged on... ...a second atomic bomb fell upon Nagasaki. NAGASAKI NAGASAKI Just like Hiroshima, NAGASAKI NAGASAKI Nagasaki was destroyed in the blink of an eye. Nagasaki was destroyed in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, since the discussion was making no progress, it was brought to a close. Another cabinet meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's official residence... ...in which they debated whether the war should be continued or ended. As I argued at the Council of War... First, we must demand that the Emperor and his position be inviolate. Second, that any occupational forces that land in Japan are to be... ...those of a minor military power, be grated limited authority... ...and also be permitted to remain for only a short duration. Third... Japanese military disarmament is to be undertaken... ...autonomously, by the Japanese people. Fourth... Sanctions to be imposed against war criminals are to be decided by the Japanese judiciary. If our enemies do not accept these four conditions... ...we must inevitably carry on with the war. This is the opinion of the Army. Regarding the terms related to our Emperor, I am in agreement. But as for the other three conditions... ...the Allied nations will most likely reject them. Our circumstances are such that we must resist the urge to make absolute demands. If we miss this opportunity... ...we will lose any chance for peace. This is why it is necessary to have a decisive battle on Japanese soil. We should wait until the tide of battle turns in our favor... ...and then proceed to negotiate. This will put us in a position to demand far more favorable terms from our enemies. Minister Anami, you keep repeating "war for peace, war for peace..." ...and are emphatic about fighting a decisive battle on home soil... ...but does Japan have the resources left to do so? We have already committed all of our resources to this conflict. Thus, I want to hear reports from the other ministers. Minister of Munitions Toyoda Teijiro... ...Minister of Agriculture Ishiguro Tada-atsu... ...and Minister of Transportation Kohiyama Naotoro... ...took turns expressing their views... ...regarding whether Japan had the resources to continue fighting. Newsflash, this just in. Newsflash, this just in. Imperial Army and Navy headquarters... ... announced at 6 a.m., December 8th, 1941... ... that, as of the morning of the 8th, the Imperial Forces... ... have deployed themselves for war in the Western Pacific Ocean with the U.S. and Great Britain. For the first seven months of the war... ...Japan was overwhelmingly dominant. In the blink of an eye, the Imperial Forces gained complete ascendancy... ...in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean... ...and projected their immense military might as far south as Australia. But in the Pacific Theatre, a crucial strategic battle... ...was lost at Midway. From that day forward... ...the power of the Imperial Forces gradually began to wane. It became impossible to maintain the strength of the front-line troops. Eventually, the island of Okinawa was lost to the Allies. B29's flew from bases at Tenian and Saipan and dropped bombs... ...on 92 cities, starting with Tokyo, reducing them to smoldering plains of rubble. Munitions factories were destroyed one after another. 3,600,000 soldiers had been killed or wounded in the war. 1,470,000 civilians had suffered death or injury at home. The victims of the war, on all sides, exceeded 10,000,000. Japan's days as a conquering nation were numbered. Plans for the so-called "Operation Olympic..." ...which called for deploying a million Allied troops on Japanese soil... ...were well underway. And furthermore... MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE ISHIGURO MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE ISHIGURO This autumn, we expect the worst harvest since 1931. This autumn, we expect the worst harvest since 1931. Except for our farmers, most Japanese are on the brink of death from starvation. Japan has no strength to continue the fight! All of us are well aware of the current situation! Nevertheless, we shall continue to fight! Such should be our firm resolve! The discussion lasted about 3 hours... ...but they still could reach no decision. As a last resort, an Imperial Council was held... ...in which they asked the Emperor himself to decide the matter. In the presence of the Emperor, starting at 11:50 p.m., the Imperial Council was held. Even here, however, no easy decision was to be found. At the end of the meeting, the Emperor made the following judgment: "To continue the war any further... ...would be to send the people of our nation to their deaths." "I desire a swift end to the war." At 6:00 a.m., August 10th... AUGUST 10 At 6:00 a.m., August 10th... ...a telegram was transmitted to the Allies... ...via the neutral countries of Sweden and Switzerland. "With the understanding that the status of the Emperor... "..will not in any way be affected... "..the terms of the Potsdam Declaration are acceptable." TELEGRAPH BUREAU MANAGER OOE "..the terms of the Potsdam Declaration are acceptable." At 9:30 a.m. of the same day, ARMY MINISTRY: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER At 9:30 a.m. of the same day, ARMY MINISTRY: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER ARMY MINISTRY: UNDERGROUND AIR-RAID SHELTER Minister of War Anami summoned... Minister of War Anami summoned... ...all of his officers above the rank of captain... ...to a meeting in the underground bomb-shelter. Whether there is going to be peace or war... ...depends on the response of our enemies. From here on, no matter what our situation... ...we must not wander from the austere path of military discipline. We must steel ourselves against acting out of self-interest. One unruly man might bring down ruin upon our nation. MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL SHIIZAKI MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL SHIIZAKI Minister, you once told us, Minister, you once told us, "follow my lead, whether it be in advance or retreat." But have you even considered retreating? If you doubt me, slay me where I stand! CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY SAKOMIZU INTERPRETER KIHARA (PART-TIME CABINET AIDE) INTERPRETER KIHARA (PART-TIME CABINET AIDE) It's potassium cyanide. It's potassium cyanide. For an emergency, just in case. We never know when the military powers-that-be will do an about-face. If that ever happens, we could do this together. If they decide to continue fighting, it will be the ruin of everything. I guess this will be our only escape. AUGUST 12 AUGUST 12 At 0:45 a.m., August 12th... At 0:45 a.m., August 12th... ...the Overseas Broadcast Station intercepted a transmission from San Francisco. It concerned the question regarding Japan's conditional acceptance of the Declaration... ...and contained the response of the Allies. MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION COMMANDER: COLONEL ARA-O There's something fishy about this response from the Allies. It states that the Emperor and the Japanese administration... ...will be "subject to" the Commander of the Allied forces... ...which clearly implies our subordination. We cannot accept this! MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL TAKESHITA MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL TAKESHITA Minister, you must ensure that this proposal is not accepted! Minister, you must ensure that this proposal is not accepted! If that is not possible, we must commit seppuku in protest. Honorable seppuku! A meeting was immediately convened to discuss the Allied response. Well, as for the phrase "subject to..." ...according to the interpretation of the Department of Foreign Affairs... ...it does not refer to subordination, but rather to delimitation. That is far too obscure for us to depend on. Will the continuity of the Emperor's sovereignty be assured? I need this matter to be reconfirmed. Because if that is not the case, we must fight to the last man. If we try to change the terms, the entire process will break down. It also means going against the will of the Emperor. Amidst the clash of opinions, no decision could be agreed upon. So it was agreed that another Imperial Council would be held... ...in order that the Emperor might settle the matter once and for all. WAITING ROOM WAITING ROOM After the meeting, WAITING ROOM WAITING ROOM as Foreign Minister Togo was about to leave the building... as Foreign Minister Togo was about to leave the building... ...Army and Navy generals stopped him. NAVY VICE-CHIEF OF STAFF: ADMIRAL ONISHI (INVENTOR OF THE KAMIKAZE CONCEPT) NAVY VICE-CHIEF OF STAFF: ADMIRAL ONISHI (INVENTOR OF THE KAMIKAZE CONCEPT) Foreign Minister! NAVY VICE-CHIEF OF STAFF: ADMIRAL ONISHI (INVENTOR OF THE KAMIKAZE CONCEPT) NAVY VICE-CHIEF OF STAFF: ADMIRAL ONISHI (INVENTOR OF THE KAMIKAZE CONCEPT) Twenty million more! If we deployed only another twenty million kamikaze troops... ...Japan will assuredly... most assuredly win! Onishi... this is no longer about winning or losing. Our choice now is whether the Japanese people live, or die; simply that. No! Another twenty million more! If we resolve to launch half the men of our nation against the enemy as kamikaze, we can win! Foreign Minister! Please excuse me. AUGUST 13 AUGUST 13 On August 13th, AUGUST 13 a plan was submitted to the Minister of War. It advocated isolating the pro-peace movement that had accepted the Potsdam Declaration... ...and putting Tokyo under martial law. Two more days? Yes. The Imperial Council is tomorrow... ...but we must delay the Emperor's decision... ...for two more days. No, we cannot do that. I am sorry. NAVY SURGEON KOBAYASHI NAVY SURGEON KOBAYASHI Prime Minister... NAVY SURGEON KOBAYASHI ...the Minister of War is under pressure from his subordinates. Not only that... ...there are some indications that the military might take matters into their own hands. Prime Minister, we need to keep control of the military. Perhaps we should wait... Kobayashi, that simply will not do. If we miss this chance, the Soviets will overrun us in Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin... ...and not only there, but even in Hokkaido. No, this war must be ended... ...and must be ended now. General Anami will not survive this. ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERGROUND AIR RAID SHELTER AUGUST 14 The second Imperial Council began The second Imperial Council began at 10:50 a.m., on August 14th. Prime Minister Suzuki, relating that the Council of War could reach no decision... ...after hearing divergent opinions regarding the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration... ...reiterated his support for the Emperor's initial decision. I speak as the representative of the Armed Forces. If we were to accept the Declaration unconditionally... ...the fate of the Nation would be at the whim of the enemy. Therefore, we must make an additional demand of them. If they will not agree, then we must commit ourselves to battle. Our path should be to seek life in death. An eerie hush fell... Eventually, the Emperor quietly rose from his seat. Thus began Japan's longest day. JAPAN'S LONGEST DAY I have listened attentively to the main points of the opposing arguments. However, my thoughts regarding the matter have not changed... ...it is just as I had expressed it the last time. It is impossible to continue to prosecute this war. The officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces... ...must think that disarmament and the surety of occupation are unbearable burdens. I understand how our people yearn for honorable deaths as martyrs unto our nation. However... However, no matter what happens to me... ...my people... save my people. I can no longer endure... ...letting them suffer any longer. I will do everything that is within my power. If it is thought that I should speak directly to the people... ...then I will stand in front of the microphone. Regarding the officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces... ...if the Minister of War... or the Navy Minister... have any difficulty with them... ...I will go anywhere I am needed, in order to appeal to them. Suzuki. Have the Cabinet... ...immediately prepare all the documents... ...required to bring an end to the war. PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE I'll draft the end-of-war Rescript. You can draft the orders for the Armed Forces. We have no time to weep. Get busy, we're out of time. This is going to be unbelievably tough. The will of the nation has been clearly pronounced. Clearly. Now prepare this quickly... no, immediately. A telegram that we are accepting the Potsdam Declaration. When should we send it? At the same time as we make the public announcement. For the U.S. and Chinese telegrams, use Kase Shunnichi, our Swiss legate. For the Soviet Union and Great Britain, use Okamoto Suemasa, our Swedish legate. The Minister has returned! What, the Minister? The Minister is back! - Your Excellency! - Minister! - Minister! - Minister! Minister... Please tell us the results of the Imperial Council. The Emperor has issued his decision. The Declaration will be accepted without conditions. So spake His Majesty. We have no path left but to remain loyal to his Imperial will. His Majesty has decreed such, only because... ...of his faith in the loyalty of the Armed Forces. MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL IDA MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL IDA Our plan was to continue the war! MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION: LT. COLONEL IDA I demand to know why Your Excellency has changed his mind! His Majesty spoke thus unto me: "I know well your feelings of anguish... Please endure." Thus he said to me, with flowing tears. As for me personally, I can no longer oppose his will. If any of you don't like it, you'll disobey him over my dead body! So what did His Majesty say was to be the fate of Japan? He said, "From now on, I want Japan... ...to be rebuilt as a peaceful nation." "However, this is a daunting task." "It will also take a long time." "However... "...if all our people unite in cooperation... "...I believe that we can assuredly accomplish it." "I, too, along with every one of you... ...will exert myself to the utmost." Please, Minister. This is the moment when you must decisively resign. Please resign! Minister, if you were to resign, the Cabinet would crumble. They would be unable to take the steps needed to end the war. A whole new state of affairs could develop. The military would assume all political authority... We could continue the war and fight a decisive battle on home soil! Minister!

If His Majesty decides that the war must end... ...I want to know what the Eastern District Army's Strategy Council should do. The Eastern District Army's Strategy Council, eh? Hardly. Look behind you. Huh? Though the Imperial Guard is a separate entity... ...we're still under the Eastern District Army's table of organization. The Strategy Council is the central nervous system of the Eastern District Army... ...50 how can you be so spineless?

Young 'uns from the Military Affairs Section have been coming to me all morning... ...urging that the Imperial Guard rise up... ...but I've sent them all packing. But it appears that the young 'uns are hot ready to acknowledge reality. Nonetheless, my resolve is unshakable. The Eastern District Army ought to make up their minds as well.

ARMY MINISTRY: REAR COURTYARD ARMY MINISTRY: REAR COURTYARD All division members, ARMY MINISTRY: REAR COURTYARD ARMY MINISTRY: REAR COURTYARD assemble immediately in conference room one. assemble immediately in conference room one. At 15:15, the Minister will make an address. What's the point of hearing the Minister's address now? All is lost. Let it all burn. All of it. And when this is done, we Army officers, all of us... ... Will gloriously commit seppuku together. The Great East Asian War has come to a meaningless end. But this one thing shall be carved into eternity... ... that every officer of the Army Ministry and Staff Office committed seppuku. EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY HQ Army Ministry, Major Hatanaka! EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY COMMANDER: ADMIRAL TANAKA Your Excellency, please, you should not meet him. Your Excellency! No. I want to see him, and have a few words. Enter. Army Ministry, Military Affairs Section, Major Hatanaka entering! What business do you have with me? I know what you're all up to! No need to say it! Now get out! What's taking Hatanaka so long? We're at a crossroads now; things could go either way. Will Hatanaka be able to sway the Eastern District Army? No... At this point, it may not be possible. They might not be able to act now, but eventually they won't have any choice. I know that! But... but! 3:50, going on 4:00... Palace security is changing shifts. Regiment One takes over, then Regiment Two, under Colonel Haga, raises the flag. Right now they should be marching through the northwest gate. IMPERIAL PALACE: NORTHWEST GATE IMPERIAL GUARD 2ND REGIMENT COMMANDER: COLONEL HAGA DRAFT OF THE IMPERIAL RESCRIPT ENDING THE WAR The Cabinet has commenced deliberations over the draft of the Imperial Rescript. It's expected they'll take about an hour, so recording will begin around 6:00. So it'll be around 6:00? Yes. As per protocol, after the draft is completed... ...it must then be presented to His Majesty by Prime Minister Suzuki... ...whereupon the Imperial signature and seal will be affixed. DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDERSECRETARY'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDERSECRETARY'S OFFICE So it'll be at 6:00? DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDERSECRETARY'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDERSECRETARY'S OFFICE We should be done with the formalities by then. We should be done with the formalities by then. Nah, we're in a serious crunch here. We still need to send telegrams to the Allied nations. ARMY MINISTRY: LECTURE HALL So Ichigayadai's officers are all going to commit suicide. I understand, that will be glorious. But that's the very last of the final measures to be taken. Because we still have some duties to undertake first. Will the war be terminated by an absolute Imperial Rescript... ...or will we battle to the last man? It's either one or the other! But, Ida. Which of these two choices will best serve the nation? No one will know until everything unfolds. No one can predict which will be better or worse. So we might as well leave our fate to the heavens... ...and if we are to leave our fate to the heavens... ...we must do so as soldiers! Let them accuse us of insurrection... No, let them revile us as traitors! Should we not immediately enter the palace, dissuade His Majesty... ...and take the honorable path of resolute resistance? Of course, we don't know which decision the heavens will favor. But it doesn't matter either way. That judgment will be made by history. Ida. I want to lay everything on the line, this very night. I believe that we must act, and that acting is far more... ...far more righteous than the seppuku of the officers of Ichigayadai. We have already contacted the Imperial Guard; all the arrangements have been made. By virtue of our actions, the Eastern District Army... ...and the Armed Forces in their entirety will assuredly rise in support! And yet... I wonder if we can defeat such a powerful enemy... And what if... Lt. Colonel Ida! Sir, you're still thinking in terms of success or failure! It's the same way with the Imperial Rescript! Will it preserve our nation, or destroy it? Who knows the true path? The Prime Minister? The Navy Minister? The Minister of War? No one! That's why we must rise up! Ida, please approve of our plans! Ida, the fact is, the war continues! According to a message from the Eastern District Army... ...a powerful enemy fleet is approaching the Boso peninsula. If we lose our will to fight, Japan will be destroyed in a single blow. Ida! Now is the time for us to stake our lives and resolutely rise up for Japan! Hatanaka. A pure spirit burns within you. And I appreciate and approve of this. But we will take no action. You guys can go do it yourselves. Either way, tomorrow, I, you, and the rest of us are all going to die. Personally, I can accept a declaration that "we can no longer effectively wage war." Militarily speaking, our nation has crumbled. We've lost some battles, but the final verdict is not yet in. Not yet in? The Army and Navy have differing perspectives regarding the matter. If we have lost, then it was because of logistical problems. What? In the three years since the start of the war... ...the Army has fought only on small islands. We haven't engaged in a real battle. Only a decisive battle on home soil could have rendered a true verdict. So, Minister of War, are you saying that the war so far... ...has been nothing but a series of minor skirmishes? We sent 205,000 soldiers into battle, and lost 200,000 of them! Do you dare dismiss tragic defeats like Leyte as mere "logistical problems"?! Minister of War, are you passing the blame to another department? Consider our casualties: Of 236,000 men sent to Burma, 164,000 were lost. We sent 102,000 brave men to Okinawa, and 90,000 of them were Killed. And in Okinawa, it wasn't just soldiers; 92,000 civilians were also slain! That's the very point that I am making! What? Why have so many of us swallowed our tears and died? It is easy to complain about how things turned out. But they all did it out of love for Japan... ...firmly believing in our victory. Thus, if we have lost, and we can no longer effectively wage war... ...then 3,000,000 people have given their lives for nothing! As we speak, 7 million men are still out there fighting. If they are to be defeated, should not their defeat be a glorious one? Is that not our obligation to them? I believe that we should not say that "we can no longer effectively wage war." We absolutely must revise that and say that the "fortunes of war have not favored us." No. That is your position. I maintain a different opinion. IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY: GENERAL BUREAU MANAGER'S OFFICE So it can't be done at 6:00? When will it be, then? PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: CABINET GENERAL AFFAIRS SECTION PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE: CABINET GENERAL AFFAIRS SECTION 7:00. I think it can be done by 7:00. Yes, 7:00 it is. Bye. Sure, 7:00 my foot. We'll never get it done by 7:00. Chief, what's wrong? It's difficult. It's not just about ending the war... ...it's about how we're going to handle the Army. Chief, I have urgent business and must return to the Navy Ministry. I must leave, but you must ensure that it reads "we can no longer effectively wage war." Our defeat must be announced to the people in an honest way. Do you understand? We are where we are now; we must not lie to the people! EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY HQ: REGIONAL COMMAND CENTER Reports from Patrol Boats 17 and 23: Reports from Patrol Boats 17 and 23: The disposition of the enemy forces approaching Boso are as follows: One Enterprise-type aircraft carrier, two Hornet-type aircraft carriers... ... Seven cruisers and nineteen destroyers headed north in fleet formation. Repeat... Deputy Commander, sir. May I come in? Yeah. Commander... According to a report from Yokochin... ...a final decision has been reached to end the war. Well, that's a gift from heaven, indeed. Sir? How rare... my malaria isn't acting up today. I'll be speaking tonight to an assembly of all the division managers. I'm drafting the address but am having a hard time of it. Deputy Commander... Don't worry about our wishy-washy superiors. But... Any news about the enemy fleet headed for the Boso peninsula? It's a fleet, with three aircraft carriers. Squadron 207 out of Kodama has been ordered to intercept them. Three aircraft carriers, eh? That's no small school of fish. Well, they're Kodama's problem. There's a million allied troops out there trying to invade the homeland... ...seeking to destroy our Atsugi Air Base. I'll blow them all out of the water! The war... Deputy Commander, the war will not be over until that's done. You see, actually, it's not ready... It's not done yet? You got to be kidding. It's way past 6:00. It's no use talking to you, Mr. Sato. Please put the Cabinet General Affairs Section Chief on. If we don't know what time the recording's taking place, what can we... What? The Navy Minister left? That's right. Both Navy and War Ministers had urgent business and had to leave. So deliberations over the draft of the Imperial decree are going slowly. Even now, the Navy Minister... What... Huh? An estimated time, hmmm... Chief! The Navy Minister has returned. Chief, regarding the issue of "annulment..." ...I have come to agree with the Minister of War; it should read... ...the "state of the war will never turn in our favor." Let's revise it like that. But didn't you say... Chief... Let us revise it that way. So the drafting deliberations have picked up speed? Well that's good news. When do you think they'll be done? Right now it's estimated they'll finish by 7:00 or 7:30. We'll talk in more detail later. Bye. Who would've thought that Admiral Yonai would compromise? That's quite a concession on his part. He must've been pressured by the Navy Ministry when he went there. Perhaps he now truly understands General Anami's anguish. Anyway, it should all go smoothly now. Let's not get overly optimistic. Who knows what'll happen when Anami gets back from the Army Ministry. Until the Rescript is finalized, we can't breathe easy. An Imperial decree calling for an end to the war without the Minister of War's signature... ...is just a scrap of paper that can't be published. YOKOHAMA GUARDS: SHINKOYASU DORMITORY YOKOHAMA GUARDS: SHINKOYASU DORMITORY The emergency assembly is scheduled for 12:00. YOKOHAMA GUARDS: SHINKOYASU DORMITORY YOKOHAMA GUARDS: SHINKOYASU DORMITORY Before we depart for Tokyo... Before we depart for Tokyo... ...we shall enlist the aid of the large garrison at Tsurumi Sojiji... ...and thus reinforced, we shall take united action. Our goals are as follows! Likened to Marshal Pietro Badoglio of Italy, who schemed... ...unconditional surrender, the ultimate of fools... ...Cabinet Member Prime Minister Suzuki and... ...the rest of the "senior statesmen" shall be attacked! Deputy Minister, the draft of the Imperial Rescript has just been completed. It's done? So there is a Rescript ending the war? And? Uh huh... Uh huh... Well then. We shall immediately... ...deliver this to the palace. GENERAL AFFAIRS BUREAU STAFF MEMBER: SANO ESAKU His Majesty will read this at the recording session. Please take it to him immediately. The recording crew has been waiting all day. - Hurry, OK? - Yes, sir. CABINET OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR: SANO KOMONTA It's an official document that requires the Imperial autograph and seal... ...also, each minister will receive a copy. Make sure you make no errors. Speed is of the essence. We're running horribly late; I wonder when they plan to broadcast this... No, it's too late to broadcast it tonight. We haven't even made a public announcement about it yet. Too much time was spent deciding on the wording. Then how about 7:00 tomorrow morning? The sooner we broadcast it, the better. No. I want you to wait until the 16th. This broadcast must be heard by all of our troops. The enemy will be demanding that they lay down their arms... ...so those on the front lines, in particular... ...will require some time to become convinced. We are telegraphing the allied nations about our surrender, and yet... ...we should wait two more days before telling our own people? But if we do it tomorrow morning, the audience will not be large. Farm folk rise early; they'll already be out in the fields. Maybe it's not the appropriate time for the broadcast. Don't be ridiculous! Don't be ridiculous. Delaying until the 16th just means there's more time for things to go horribly wrong. Well, we could make a preliminary announcement on tonight's news. Then we can broadcast it at noon tomorrow. I believe that's the best way to handle it... - No, that would be... - Yes, that would be best. We shall settle on that as the Cabinet's decision. But Prime Minister! The broadcast will be tomorrow at noon. The front lines must be informed by then. I trust the Minister of War will spare no effort to ensure that happens. I will be returning to Hiroshima with His Excellency Hata tomorrow. Thanks for your hard work. Can you tell me what the true intent of the Army is? True intent? There's no such thing, particularly. 2ND GENERAL ARMY STAFF OFFICER: LT. COLONEL SHIRAISHI 2ND GENERAL ARMY STAFF OFFICER: LT. COLONEL SHIRAISHI But the decision to surrender unconditionally seemed to come so easily... 2ND GENERAL ARMY STAFF OFFICER: LT. COLONEL SHIRAISHI 2ND GENERAL ARMY STAFF OFFICER: LT. COLONEL SHIRAISHI There must be a reason for the Army's quick acceptance of it. There must be a reason for the Army's quick acceptance of it. Led by His Excellency, General Anami, the troops will solemnly withdraw in an orderly manner. So there is no hidden agenda? It is as you say. Understood. As to whether we continue to fight or not... ...I believe that the best path has been chosen. Going back to your quarters? No, it's still early. I'm going to visit Commander Mori at the Imperial Guards; it's been a while since I last saw him. We were told that His Majesty is making a recording today. At what time would that be? Such an event might require the Imperial Guard to be of service... ...hence we need to know the details. The recording has already been made, hasn't it? The Aide-de-Camp and the rest of us heard that there's going to be one... ...but we weren't given any details. - But... - Hold on. I'm sure they really don't know. Such were the orders of the Navy Minister regarding unconditional surrender. But... ...as for the attitude that we here at Atsugi Air Base ought to take... ...let me be very clear on this! No matter what circumstances may arise... ...I will resolutely engage in battle. And I expect my officers to follow my example. The Navy Minister's command was that... ...there is to be absolute compliance with the Imperial decree. Are you suggesting that we act contrary to these orders? I'll answer that question. It is impossible for our actions to be contrary to the Imperial will. An enemy fleet has arrived off the Boso peninsula. Squadron 207 of Kodama Air Base in Saitama... ...is currently preparing to attack. The war is not over! SQUADRON 207 SAITAMA PREFECTURE: KODAMA AIR BASE AIR FORCE BRIGADE COMMANDER: COLONEL YANAKA AIR FORCE BRIGADE COMMANDER: COLONEL YANAKA Our target lies 400 kilometers off the Boso peninsula... Our target lies 400 kilometers off the Boso peninsula... ...a fleet of about thirty ships, including three aircraft carriers. We launch with the aim of attacking at dawn. Takeoff time... Midnight! In honor of this mission, the loyal people of Kodama... ...have been permitted to give you a special send-off. For those who have been living under the shadows of enemy bombers... ...for the people of the home-front who have been gnashing their teeth in suffering... ...today is the day we paint the rising sun on our wings... ...and show these good people our great formation of thirty-six aircraft. The war for the homeland has now begun. The rise or fall... ...of our Empire is balanced on the wings of you, our sallying heroes! IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY: GENERAL BUREAU SECTION OFFICE Hey... Almost... I'm almost done. The Emperor has read the Rescript, and has made revisions in five places. What? But... But it'll take me over an hour to re-transcribe it. We can't help it. Just patch paper over the revised parts and redo them. We just contacted the Cabinet about it, and they're in a panic. Then it can't be helped. I'd usually never ask this, but... ...could you please have someone help me? "...the general trends of the world have all turned against Japan's interest." "Furthermore, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb... -"...to wreak devastation..." - Hold it, hold it, hold it... "...the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb... -"...to wreak devastation..." - That's not how it goes, come on! "...the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb... "...to slaughter the innocent." Then after that, it's "and wreak devastation." Well, we've got no time. Just write it in small print next to the line. Yes, sir. I will now have an audience with His Majesty... ...and will receive his Imperial autograph and seal unto this Rescript. The spirit of the wings of our fearless cadets... ... is the spirit of victory I wish I could send my mother a picture... ... of the splendidly sinking enemy-ship The seven buttons worn by our young-blooded cadets... ... are those of the cherry-blossom and anchor As always, today they fly, they fly over Kasumigaura... ... over which clouds of great hope emerge IMPERIAL PALACE: UNDERGROUND GOVERNMENT OFFICE IMPERIAL PALACE: UNDERGROUND GOVERNMENT OFFICE The arms of our fiery and vibrant cadets... The arms of our fiery and vibrant cadets... ... are metal triggers, their hearts are balls of fire "Hirohito" Prime Minister... Word has reached me that there has been some unrest in the ranks of the Imperial Guard. Have you heard of this, Prime Minister? I... have not, no one has told me. But that's silly. Not the Imperial Guard. They have pledged themselves to protect His Majesty. The Chief of Staff will have to obey the Imperial Guard Commander... ...50 the problem is the Commander himself. But we have a lot of potential comrades among the commanding officers. If enough of them join us, eventually the Commander will have to join as well. No, it's not going to be that easy. Convincing him will be extremely difficult. We'll take on the job of convincing him. First, we'll hunt down Lt. Colonel Ida of the Military Affairs Section. No matter what, if the broadcast is made, we've lost. We have to move tonight. We have to get it done tonight, no matter what. By the way, I was able to contact Kuroda at the flight school. He should be showing up any minute now. Kuroda is going to take a squadron and overfly the palace. They'll give us cover and encouragement. And will inspire the Air Force to rise up in support... Quiet. This announcement is for everyone in the nation. There is going to be an important broadcast tomorrow at noon, August 15th. Everyone in the nation is to listen to it. To repeat this message... To repeat this message... Fine, so we have until noon tomorrow. Fine, so we have until noon tomorrow. There is going to be an important broadcast... Fine, so we have until noon tomorrow. There is going to be an important broadcast... There is going to be an important broadcast... Let's hurry up and convince Imperial Guard Commander Mori. Let's hurry up and convince Imperial Guard Commander Mori. ... tomorrow at noon, August 15th. Let's hurry up and convince Imperial Guard Commander Mori. ... tomorrow at noon, August 15th. ... tomorrow at noon, August 15th. And as for convincing the Minister of War... ... tomorrow at noon, August 15th. ... tomorrow at noon, August 15th. We have a suitable person for the job: Army Affairs Section, Lt. Colonel Takeshita. We have a suitable person for the job: Army Affairs Section, Lt. Colonel Takeshita. His sister is the Minister of War's wife; they're brothers-in-law. "The Imperial decision has been made." "All in the military are to obey the Imperial will." "Let no shame be cast upon our illustrious traditions and brilliant deeds of arms... "...even unto the very last moment." "Let not a single soldier commit a rash or blind act." "I earnestly desire that we all demonstrate to all people... "...the honor and glory of the Imperial military." "I humbly swallow copious tears... "...and thus instruct you all." "The attached Imperial Rescript will be announced tomorrow on the 15th... "...at the stroke of noon... "...when His Majesty's radio-broadcast is scheduled to occur... "...whereupon our wish is for thorough empathy with the Imperial will." This telegraph will be immediately sent to all Army units. - Arao. - Yes? I want the young military officers to live. Excuse me? I want there to be a path for them... a way for them to continue to serve... ...say, becoming a police officer, for example. Are you going back to the Cabinet? I've made my rounds today... ...like a postman, between the Prime Minister's Residence and the Army Ministry. It's been a busy day, but I believe I've done everything there is to be done... The Imperial decree has been completed... ...the Emperor's sighed it and stamped the imperial seal, so we're done, right? You know, we... No, you see, it can't be announced... ...with just His Majesty's autograph and seal. The Prime Minister and his colleagues have to countersign it... Yes, they're about to get started. Just a little more time. Just a little! "Suzuki Kantaro" IMPERIAL PALACE: IMPERIAL GUARD HQ So this plan, you say... ...has been authorized by the Minister of War, the Chief of Staff... ...the Eastern District Army Commander, and the Imperial Guard Commander, is that right? That's right. - Are you sure? - Captain, sir! Could we alone have drawn up such an important plan? "Anami Korechika" His Majesty will soon be... making his recording. I will now depart for the Imperial Household Agency. Convince Imperial Guard Commander Mori? Everyone except the Imperial Guard Commander is with us. Now is the time for you to become involved, Lt. Colonel Ida! Imperial Guard Commander Mori was our instructor at Army College. He'd treat us like we were kids; we can't persuade him. I wonder if I would fare any better... No, ho matter who goes, he'd probably... If the Commander opposes the plan, then what? If you go to him, Ida, I'm sure he'd approve of it! If you decide to do this, and he doesn't approve... ...then we'll have no choice but to abandon the plan. Ida! It's no longer an issue of whether we'll succeed or fail. I've already explained that to you. Is the Eastern District Army mobilizing? I went to persuade their Commander... ...but so far we don't know how many will join us. But if the Imperial Guard revolts and besieges the palace, the entire Army will follow! But their Commander is... That's why, that's why we want you, Ida, to appeal to him! If you do this and Imperial Guard Commander Mori won't budge... ...then we'll manfully abandon this plan. Ida! Please! Help us! Hatanaka... ...there's almost no chance of convincing Commander Mori. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Hatanaka. I was sure that every officer here at Ichigadai ought to bravely commit suicide. But that's easier said than done. However... I've been struck by your singular passion. I'm going to lay it all on the line for you. - Then you will, Ida... - However, Hatanaka... If I can't convince the Commander, you really will abort this plan, right? Yes, sir! YOKOHAMA GUARDS: TSURUMI SOJI TEMPLE The word "surrender" is not in the dictionary of the Imperial Army! We must fight, down to the last man! - Therefore, you bastards... - But sir... ...there's been no orders, no command to mobilize from Shibuya headquarters. Don't get wishy-washy on me! You guys heard the news. There's going to be an important broadcast at noon tomorrow! We don't have a moment to lose! Immediately, let us unite in action! The countersigning by all the ministers is complete. Then, Mr. Sato, we can begin. We're going to transmit the telegrams now. To all the Allied nations. All right? Bye now. -Do we... - Send them. Understood. It's all over now... 11:00... It's been a long day... Can't think of a longer one. The Cabinet ministers, having met constantly since the 9th... ...were as one overcome by a deep physical and mental fatigue. Most of them fell into a state of near despondency. All kinds of tangled thoughts came and went in their torpor. Some struggled to comprehend the meaning of the nation's first defeat in its long history... Some could not stop thinking of the consequences of not ending the war... Atomic bombs destroying city after city, one after another... One million Allied troops flooding onto Kyushu's Satsuma Peninsula... ...and Kanto's Kujukuri-hama Bay. The Soviet Union in Hokkaido... no, the Soviet Union marching south... ...into the Korean Peninsulas, into northern Kyushu, even as far as Chugoku. Japan getting divided into parts... men, women, even children and the elderly... ...all falling and dying amidst horrid plumes of gunpowder smoke... ...the isles of Japan becoming isles of death, mountains built of 80-million corpses... But physical exhaustion overwhelmed these vague thoughts. As these thoughts faded, they were replaced by one last one: "I'm tired. It was a long day. It was a truly long day... "...but this long day is finally over." In this thought they were united, and they were all wrong. The long day was far from over; only half of it had elapsed. The Commander of the Guard is with a guest? What guest? Lt. Colonel Shiraishi, from from the 2nd General Army Staff Office. Colonel Shiraishi... isn't Colonel Shiraishi the Guard Commander's... - ...brother-in-law. Yes. - We don't have time for this! Ida! While you're here, I'll go to the Shibui Barracks in Surugadai. The barracks in Surugadai? Yes! I'm going to appeal to Lt. Colonel Takeshita of the Military Affairs Section. ...and ask him to have the Minister of War take decisive action! I am much obliged to you for many things. No... I'm just very glad that things resolved uneventfully. Excuse me. All during these meetings about ending the war... ...I have spoken as a representative of the Armed Forces... ...and have been quite obstinate in expressing my opinions. I now want to humbly express my apologies. My honest intent was a simple one, namely, to protect the nation. I had no other agenda. Please understand, and forgive me. I understand very well. I want to thank you with all my heart for your frank opinions. Whatever was said, it came from your passionate concern for the nation. But, General Anami... The nation of Japan is at peace. I do not feel much anxiety about its future. I, too, believe the same. This was sent to me from the Southern front. I do not smoke, so I brought them, hoping that they might give you pleasure. Anami, my friend, you have an eloquent way of saying farewell. How loud should my voice be? Your normal tone of voice would be fine. We, after greatly considering the general state of the World, and the specific conditions of our Empire... ...have decided that the settlement of the situation requires an extraordinary measure... ...which we now announce to our good and loyal subjects. Holding our senior cadets in high esteem... Every time we hear of their distinguished deeds, it gives us a thrill Firmly work up, work up the spirit of attack No enemy is a match for the Yamato spirit However, the conflict has now lasted for nearly four years. The officers of the Army and Navy have lead a valiant war effort. They have been diligently supported by our Servants in the Government. They have been devotedly served by Our hundred million Subjects. Despite the fact that each has done his very, very best... ...the war situation has developed in a manner not to the Nation's advantage. I wish I could send my mother a picture... ... of the splendidly sinking enemy-ship And furthermore, should we continue to fight... ...not only would our Nation be destroyed and our Subjects obliterated... ...but eventually, all of human civilization would vanish from the Earth. This being the case, how can we preserve the multitudes of our people... The final Attack Squadron, #12, is departing, sir! Your Excellency. The second infantry regiment of the Imperial Guard... ...is already in the palace compound, with military banners raised. They are going to revolt at 2:00 and besiege the palace. We are against the government defeatists who hope that we can arrange... ...for the Emperor to be retained as a mere figurehead. Our Emperor a puppet?! Our people totally demoralized?! Our homeland devastated?! Does this sit well with you? To put it bluntly, they're letting His Majesty clean up the mess of the war they lost... ...while they themselves are trying to shirk responsibility. That's what the current Ministers are doing. You can argue all you want, but now that the Emperor has made his decision... ...I cannot agree with any action that opposes the will of His Majesty. But, Your Excellency! IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY: CHAMBERLAIN'S OFFICE It would be unfortunate if the lid came off... do you have an appropriate container? I think something can be found... We'd really appreciate it if you could find an appropriate container. How about something like this? Yes, that would do just fine. Thank you. The broadcast will be at noon... Where should this be placed to keep it safe? SURUGADAI, KANDA (EAST OF IMPERIAL PALACE): SHIBUI BARRACKS SURUGADAI, KANDA (EAST OF IMPERIAL PALACE): SHIBUI BARRACKS The Commander? SURUGADAI, KANDA (EAST OF IMPERIAL PALACE): SHIBUI BARRACKS SURUGADAI, KANDA (EAST OF IMPERIAL PALACE): SHIBUI BARRACKS He's raised a military flag inside of the palace grounds? He's raised a military flag inside of the palace grounds? So Colonel Haga has agreed? Yes. They're going to rise up at 2:00 a.m. And besiege the palace. In addition, four other commanders have also given proactive consent to our plan! What about Guard Commander Mori? No, the Guard Commander alone has not agreed. Ida and Shiizaki are even now trying to convince him... ...and that's just a matter of time. Col. Takeshita, we want to ask of you to persuade Minister of War Anami. No one else can do that but you. But even if I explained everything to him, at this stage the Minister probably won't... No, it will work! As long as you're the one who goes to him, Col. Takeshita. Please! There's no time, I have to get back to the Imperial Guards. We've come this far, we'll do it by brute force alone if we have to. Col. Takeshita. We're not asking for you to agree right this minute. But if everything goes according to plan, then please, join us! Hatanaka. I'll go and see the Minister immediately. Yes? I don't know if I'll ask him to take action. But I'm a little concerned about him. The broadcasting station is going to take it? Yes, since the broadcast will be made from the station... ...I think that it is the obvious choice. But... ...there is much cause for concern... ...in taking this record with us in the middle of the night. Besides... ...we heard that there is unrest among elements of the Army. If that's the case, it might be best to keep it here, in the Imperial Household. But there is no appropriate place here in which to keep it safe. Maybe the Chamberlain and his men should care for it, as they attend upon His Majesty. CHAMBERLAIN TOKUGAWA CHAMBERLAIN TOKUGAWA I see. CHAMBERLAIN TOKUGAWA CHAMBERLAIN TOKUGAWA In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it. In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it. Your Excellency... I have said everything that I wanted to say. No... ...one last thing. If there is to be no decisive battle on home soil... if the war ends so ignominiously... ...wouldn't that be a craven betrayal of the heroic spirits... ...of the three-million and more who have given their lives at the front lines? Even now as we speak, kamikaze pilots are headed out... ...launching an attack against an enemy fleet. Instead of fighting to the last soldier... ...if we lay down our arms by command of the Emperor... It sounds dutiful, but it's just a shirking of responsibility! What will the people think of the military then? Will they not consider us to be self- serving, double-dealing cowards? Your Excellency. I will say no more. Now is the time for all military men to stake their lives... ...and the Imperial Guard ought to be in the vanguard. Please... ...if may have Your Excellency's resolution. I now have a sufficient understanding of what you're all aiming at. Frankly speaking, I'm impressed. I will now go to the Meiji Jingu Shrine. Yes? As just a simple Japanese man... ...I'm going to bow down in front of the Meiji Jingu shrine... ...and decide on the path I am to take. While I'm at it, I will also hear what Chief of Staff Mizutani has to say. Yes sir! Goodbye! We have with us Captain Kuroda of the pilot school. How did it go? I think he will take action. He's going to talk to Chief of Staff Mizutani. Then he will... I'll give you the details later. Shiizaki's here, too, go wait in there with them. Very good, Sir! Army Lt. Colonel Hatanaka entering! Mr. Shiizaki... What is happening? His Excellency will be going to Meiji Jingu. You're not going to Meiji Jingu, you're going to the palace! What? Who the hell are you? Captain Kuroda of the pilot school. I have come upon hearing the news of the Imperial Guard's uprising. What uprising? Your Excellency! With respect to rising up, what is your intent? I have none! Lt. Colonel Hatanaka, this is our last chance. We can't just linger, we're running out of time. Your Excellency! We implore you! Reconsider! Please reconsider! Importunate puppy! Your Excellency! Insolence! Your Excellency! You bastards... Hatanaka! What have you done?! I couldn't convince the Commander... no... there was no time... ...I had no time... so I had to do it... Ida! Together, quickly... IMPERIAL GUARD CHIEF OF STAFF MIZUTANI Ida! Together, quickly... Ida! Together, quickly... As fast, fast as possible, at once, we must go to the Eastern District Army... Ida, please! As fast as possible, go and convince the Eastern District Army to rise... Please!

Yes sir, shortly! - Very well. Third Captain. - Yes, sir! Command! The regiment shall immediately occupy the palace, and secure it!

As your Captain, I want to thank all of you with all my heart... ...that though you are civilians, you have nonetheless chosen the path of honor! MINISTER OF WAR'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE It is I, Takeshita. What are you doing here? Never mind, come in. Yes, sir. "The compassion of His Majesty is profoundly moving; My heart touched, I am struck dumb. - 23 Showa, August 14th, Evening, General Korechika (Anami)" IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY Find the switchboard! Cut all the phone lines! Find the switchboard! Cut all the phone lines! Hurry! GENERAL AFFAIRS BUREAU GENERAL AFFAIRS BUREAU Go!

IMPERIAL PALACE: SAKASHITA GATE IMPERIAL PALACE: SAKASHITA GATE Stop! Who are you? It's the Information Bureau Director. Back it up! Back up the car! Back it up! What? The Information Bureau Director is here? Yes sir, we just took him prisoner. He's connected to the recording. We caught ourselves a fine fish. Well done! Now don't let down your guard. Yes, sir. I wonder how Ida is doing at the Eastern District Army. Well, I hope. Yeah. If they don't mobilize soon, there's a danger that we'll be exposed. They'll uncover our forged orders. EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY HQ: STAFF ROOM EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY HQ: STAFF ROOM An uprising? An uprising? The Imperial Guards have revolted? That's... that's right. We got a phone call from the Imperial Guard Staff Office making that claim. What do they mean by "uprising?" Imperial Guard Commander Mori has been... killed! What?! STAFF OFFICER ITAGAKI As we have said, the aim of the uprising of the Imperial Guard... ...is strictly in interests of protecting the nation. We will be offering His Majesty a final report of our views; there is no other agenda. EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TAKASHIMA EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TAKASHIMA What? EASTERN DISTRICT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TAKASHIMA Chief of Staff... If the Eastern District Army will take a stand... ...surely the entire Home Army will also take action! If that happens, His Majesty might change his mind, too... we implore you! If we don't act immediately, it will all be for nothing. If His Majesty's recording is broadcast, all will be lost! Now is the time to resolutely rise in defense of the nation! Your Excellency! A ROOM AT IMPERIAL GUARD HQ A ROOM AT IMPERIAL GUARD HQ Get in! Get in! - Bureau chief! - Oh! No talking! Talking and smoking are prohibited! All of you will write down your names, ranks and honors on this paper. It's very hot in here; may we take off our jackets? No, and that's an order! I'm going to the palace right away to suppress this rebellion! Sir, please wait until we find out more... until we know what we're up against. We don't know what the situation is. All we know is that a group of armed Imperial Guards have revolted. We must first investigate the situation. Can you contact the palace? Sir, we're doing everything we can... ...but it seems they've cut the phone lines. So the recording was done late tonight inside the palace? Yes. Where is the recording? We have given it to the Imperial Household Agency. The Imperial Household Agency? To whom at the Imperial Household Agency? I don't know his name. He is a Chamberlain. A Chamberlain, you say? We're done. Take them away. Yes, sir! The record is within our reach. All that's left now is... The uprising of the Eastern District Army, and having the Minister of War take action. Has the Minister of War arrived yet? Lt. Colonel Takeshita has gone to fetch him. He will be here shortly. This is Captain Kuroda of the pilot school. I have come to deliver a message to Lt. Colonel Takeshita. What?! They've killed Commander Mori? Hatanaka. It's no good. The Eastern District Army is frozen in place. There's no indication they'll rise. Give up and withdraw the troops. If we continue the siege, it'll become a national calamity. Then we'll have to battle the Eastern District Army. I have no fear of battle! We have control of both the palace and the Emperor! We also have many prisoners, such as broadcast president Shimomura! Don't be stupid! How long will the Imperial Guards stand with us, how that you've killed their commander?! Without their solidarity, how can we stand in battle? When they find out about the Commander's death, their morale will plummet! Don't you understand? Withdraw the troops before dawn. As for what happened tonight... ...we'll take the blame for it ourselves. Hatanaka. Just let it be. What happened here tonight... ...the people of the world will probably laugh at us bitterly, and think of it as... ...a fleeting, final struggle by the Japanese Army. A midsummer night's dream. Now, I'm going to go and report the situation to the Minister of War. Okay, Hatanaka? You must withdraw the troops before dawn. A bump in the road; looks like this might take longer than we thought. The Eastern District Army is going to fight us? Don't make me laugh. We have the Emperor; do you think they'll attack us with tanks and planes? "2.26 Incident." an attempted coup d'etat by young military officers on February 26, 1936. The men who launched the 2.26 Incident were reviled as traitors... "2.26 Incident." an attempted coup d'etat by young military officers on February 26, 1936. "2.26 Incident." an attempted coup d'etat by young military officers on February 26, 1936. ...because they didn't have the Emperor in their custody. But... ...our situation is the exact opposite. Those who attack us will be the rebels. Besides, our orders remain in force. If we can hold out long enough... ...the entire Army will eventually hear about it, and they will certainly side with us. The final victory will be ours, no matter what happens. And if anyone gets in our way... That's right... That record... If that ever got broadcast, all would be lost. We must find that record as soon as possible; every second, every minute counts! Guards! Bring those broadcast people out here! Hurry up! Quickly! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry it up! Hurry! - Hurry! - Hurry! - Hurry! - Hurry! Go! All right, charge! So you are certain that the record was given to one of the Chamberlains? That's right. What was the name of the Chamberlain? Tonight was the first time I'd met him. I didn't get his name. Then... ...could you identify him if you saw his face? Yes. I think so. - Second Captain! - Yes, sir! Take this man to the Imperial Household Agency and find that record. It's a precious item, so exercise extreme care! IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY Squad... Halt! Load guns! Begin the search for the record! Where do we go? Hurry up! - Stop! Who is it? - Ignore him! Forward! Stop! Who goes there?! I'm an Eastern District Army Staff Officer. I'm here to meet my Imperial Guard counterparts. Staff Officer Fuha, Eastern District Army. Itagaki, of the same. What kind of stupidity are you bastards up to? We've come to find out what's going on. Officer, name yourself! We better see how the Commander is doing. As for the forged orders, you've got a lot of detailed explaining to do later. - Move! - Move, out of the way! It's all right, let them see. Let them see the fate of cowards who refuse to rise in the face of national danger. Let these gutless officers of the Eastern District Army have a good look. IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY Alright! Alright! GENERAL MANAGEMENT DIVISION All right, that's enough. Is this the fellow you gave the record to? No, he was taller. Oh yes, he had a big nose, too. CHAMBERLAIN TODA CHAMBERLAIN TODA I must ask you to excuse me; I must ask you to excuse me; His Majesty may require me to attend upon him. What? You haven't found it yet? We're searching as fast as we can... ...but there are so many rooms, the whole building is like a labyrinth. Put more men on it. Order! Add the reserve medium platoon to the search team. Make every effort to find the record. Get it quickly! Pass on the order. Yes, sir. The Minister of War is late, what is going on? We'll make another call to see if he has left yet. You boys keep saying the same thing. And why haven't you contacted the Commander of the Guards yet? Colonel, sir... the Commander is dead. What? Colonel, we would have you assume his role and take command. The Commander has died? The Commander of the Guards is dead... What the hell's going on around here?! You're an Imperial Guard Staff Officer, you must know something! The Minister of War will be here shortly. Until then, Sir, you must assume command of the Imperial Guard. We are all familiar with the details of the plan. Your Excellency... Your Excellency... Ida. You needn't say anything. I'm aware of some of the details. I also know about the killing of Commander Mori. You're here to apologize. As long as the Eastern District Army doesn't revolt, it'll all be over soon. KYOHAMA HIGHWAY: GREAT BRIDGE OVER THE TAMAGAWA RIVER We're now entering Tokyo! Our first target: Prime Minister Suzuki! They haven't found it yet? Kill anyone who gets in the way! Slay them without mercy! Find that record immediately! Yes, sir. We've searched high and low, and it's nowhere to be found... Maybe... the record is being kept close to His Majesty? I know what you're all up to! Now... Now I know what you're up to! You're rebelling! That's why Minister Anami and the Commander of the Eastern District Army haven't arrived. And maybe, it was you who murdered our Commander! You have been deceiving me! I will take no further orders from any of you. Get the hell out of the palace! If you intend to continue, then you'll have to kill me! You'll do this over my dead body! We require that you follow our orders. What? You must obey the orders of your Commander. Unfortunately, your Commander is dead... ...but his orders live on. But... you probably made up those orders! The military acts on orders alone. Orders from superior officers cannot be questioned!

Maybe the record is at the broadcast bureau... But then again... But then again... Shiizaki... The Minister of War will not stir. The Eastern District Army will not mobilize. And on top of all that, we can't find the record. There's nothing more we can do... nothing more! Don't panic! We can still do this. Huh? Go now to the occupied broadcast bureau. And just at the break of dawn, broadcast to all of Japan: "We must not accept the Declaration. Japan shall fight a war of total resistance. "If you hear a broadcast of the Emperor accepting the Potsdam Declaration... "...know it to be a trick of cowardly senior statesmen. "The genuine will of His Majesty is that his glorious Army and Navy... "...should defend the nation to the last man!" Your Excellency! Let me go with you! You fool! What are you saying?! The only one who will die tonight is me. Don't you know that it takes more courage to live than to die? When you're as old as I am, it isn't that hard to cut your belly. What is difficult is that task that awaits all of you young people. But what good can we do by living? Minister... Minister, do you believe that the nation can be rebuilt? It must be rebuilt. All kinds of hardship await those who will live on. However... However, from this day onward... ...Japan's path through history is going to change. As to how it will change, how it must be changed... ...I no longer have any idea, whatsoever. But no matter what the future has in store... ...each and every Japanese must stand by their station... ...live on, endure, and work earnestly. In no other way can the nation be rebuilt. And not only that... Those who live on must build a Japan... ...that will never have to face such a miserable day again. I want you to make every effort to create that kind of Japan.

He said, "I'm going out there. Assemble the troops in the garden. "I'm going to speak to the troops from my heart. "Also, please ask the Military Liaison Chamberlain to attend upon me."

ENSIGN KORE-AKIRA: 2ND SON OF MINISTER OF WAR ANAMI RECORD OF THE EMPEROR'S VOICE (COPY) RECORD OF THE EMPEROR'S VOICE (ORIGINAL) PROVISIONAL RESIDENCE OF GENERAL TAKAO, YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE PRIME MINISTER Ah... I'm so glad... so glad that you're safe. Mr. Sakomizu, does today's Privy Council meeting at the palace start at 11:00? Yes. After that meeting, I want to hold a Cabinet meeting... ...and call for the mass resignation of all Cabinet members. It's time for us elders to step down. From now on, Japan must be lead by much younger people. All officers of the military and people of all stations! We ask you to take to heart the original intent of our uprising... ...which was to expose the treachery of the ministers, to destroy conspiracies... ...and to protect the nation, defending it to the last man! To protect the nation, we soldiers who have risen up today, on August 15th... ...are making an announcement to all the soldiers and people of the nation. Hello, Mr. Togo? At 11:00 today there will be a Privy Council meeting at the palace. Inasmuch as the end of the war has been officially decided... Yes, I heard about it yesterday. Yes, but afterward, the Cabinet will meet in order that they might resign. That's correct, a mass resignation. Thank you. The broadcast bureau? Yes, we can deploy troops right away. Huh? What?! The record got there?! Both the original and copy, you're sure? I'm going to the Parliamentary Affairs Room. Mr. Shimomura, I know you'll be able to coordinate the resignations. I must go to the Palace to prepare for the Privy Council meeting at 11:00. The Secretary General is very busy. These last 24 hours, even two or three of him would not have been enough. But why would they have a Privy Council meeting to decide to end the war again? After all, the fact of the matter is that the decision has already been made. No, not necessarily. Yes? It requires all kinds of formalities. It may be more accurate to call them "ceremonies." After all, it's the funeral of the Japanese empire. We don't care if we win or lose; we don't do this for ourselves! We only wish to live in the righteous state of genuine loyalty! All officers of the military and people of all stations! We ask you to take to heart the original intent of our uprising... ...which was to expose the treachery of the ministers, to destroy conspiracies... ...and to protect the nation, defending it to the last man! With respect to the conclusion of the war... ...starting today at noon... ...His Majesty's voice will be... ...broadcast to all the people over the radio. BROADCAST BUREAU: STUDIO 8 BROADCAST BUREAU STAFF: WADA NOBUKATA What a horrible time for my malaria to flare up... ...at a time of emergency... ...but... ...Atsugi Air Base will resist... resist to the very end! Atsugi Air Base... to the very end! To the very end! Everyone is assembled to listen to the Emperor's broadcast. Since our kamikaze attack was unsuccessful... ...and the city of Kumagaya has been destroyed by B-29 firebombing... ...there are many who think that that's what the broadcast will be about. That the Emperor is going to admonish and encourage us... ...to keep on fighting. BROADCAST BUREAU: OUTSIDE STUDIO 8 His Excellency, the Commander of the Eastern District Army... ...will be entering to witness the broadcast. His Majesty's broadcast will finally be made... Be sure to maintain your vigilance. I can't let them broadcast the end of the war! I'll kill them all! Stop! - Let me go! Let me go! - Stop! How could they end the war?! Who cares about a broadcast?! How could they end the war?! If he acts up again, just cut him down! No! Let me go! Let me go! How could they end the war?! How could they end the war?! There will now be an important broadcast. We ask for everyone listening to please stand. His Majesty, the Emperor, will now address the nation... ...and pronounce his great Rescript. And now, with deep respect, we convey to you the Emperor's voice. We, reflecting profoundly on the state of the world... ... and the prevailing condition of Our Empire... ... have decided that extraordinary measures are required to effect a settlement... ... and hereby announce to our loyal citizens... ... that we have ordered our Government to communicate to the Governments... ... of the United States, Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union... ... that our Empire accepts the provisions of their joint Declaration.
