Come on, come on, hurry it up. Get in there. That's it, Hoffman. 200 pound. 100% pure, just like I promised. Indeed, Mr. Williams. Your, uh, abilities have surprised even me. Just cut the horseshit, Hoffman, and give me my money. Hanging around here is making me kind of nervous. That's quite understandable. You miserable bastard, we had a deal! What the hell do you call this? Gun. I trust that everything is in order? It's ready and waiting. The detonator, please. Come on, come on, let's go. Move it! This stuff's got to be worth millions. I say at least take a little taste. Don't even think about it, either of you. You know the drill. We sit and we wait, and we don't touch the merchandise. Who the hell are you? John Tucker, civilian operated police. You have committed a crime and been found guilty. You have a right to die. Should you choose to relinquish that right, you will be arrested and imprisoned until proven innocent. You must be crazy. The three of us against you. I can count. Nobody's that fast. Nobody. That's my opinion. Piece of shit! Baby, don't let me down. Lousy piece of shit! Come on! That darn cop. Come on. Get in. What do you want, Tucker? I'm busy. I don't know where you get your information, Cindi, but you were right on the money this time. Did you ever doubt it? So how many did you get? Three dead, one alive. Alive? Ooh. What's that, first time this year for you? Look, $2,000 a head, that's the bounty. Just have the money ready. Oh, and listen, you better send somebody out here because there's a couple hundred pounds of dope stashed inside. I got that. Oh, and Tuck, Marion called. Three times. You didn't stand her up again, did you? You'll see me again, Tucker. Count on it! Yeah, sure. In about 50 years. Fucking asshole. Hey. Need the paperwork, Tuck, before I can give you the money, how many times have I got to tell you that? Cindi, I don't have time for that shit. I'll do it later. That's what you always tell me, Tucker. You know, never ceases to amaze me the things I'll let you get away with. This 'cause you're so crazy about me, Cindi. Feels to me you're about a grand short here. 10% for me, Tucker, that was the deal, remember? Just testing. Go on and get out of here, would you? Hey Tucker, better get in there. There's some new guy already breaking all your records. That'll be the day You can't be top gun forever, Tucker. Don't bet on it. Go ahead. You must be John Tucker. I heard a lot about you. Where'd you learned to shoot like that, kid? You might say I learned from the best. Oh yeah? And, uh, who might that be? You'd never believe me. Step aside. Go. Guess you better find yourself another teacher, kid. Heh. Good morning, Rose Stabler reporting live from the inner harbor of Mobile. I'm standing here at what might appear to be the aftermath of a terrorist attack, perhaps somewhere in the Middle East, but certainly not here in the United States. But sadly, that's not the case. At sometime close to 4:00 AM this morning, this Colombian-registered freighter docked here at the McDuffy terminal became the victim of a massive bombing attack. Officials here at the site have informed us that they have found the body of what they believe to be the captain of the vessel, on the docks, apparently shot to death during the attack. Rescue workers have so far recovered the bodies of 22 crew members from aboard the ship, and although the search continues, there's little hope among those of us here that any survivors will be found. Although unconfirmed at this time, there is speculation among law enforcement personnel that this brutal bombing attack is in some way related to an international drug trafficking operation. Investigators at Channel 3 News have made numerous attempts to contact David Mickland, Chairman of the Civilian Operated Police Incorporated for his comments, but all calls to his office remain unanswered at this time. Hey, Monroe, how in the hell did this happen? I thought I told you not to assign any of our personnel to that sector. None were. I did just what you told me, Mr. Mickland, like I always do. The orders went out on the computer last night. Hey, maybe you just got lucky, huh? Bullshit, no cop gets that lucky. Somebody tipped him off. See if you can find out who it was and how we found out, OK? Do it. Sure, boss. Well do it! You have a call on line four, Mr. Mickland. I told you I'm not taking any calls today. PHONE): He says it's a matter of life and death. All right, I'll take it. Hey, what the hell's the matter with you? I told you not to call me here. Look, don't worry about it. It's in the evidence room. Well yeah, I'm sure. Now listen, don't call me here anymore, OK? Shit! He hung up on me. That son of a bitch hung up on me! I'm afraid our Mr. Mickland is getting just a bit nervous. Would you like me to remove him from the picture? Considering that we have $40 million worth of merchandise sitting in his police station, I shouldn't think that would be very wise. Priority at this moment is to trace down and eliminate anything that can link us to last night's events. I trust you can handle that assignment. I assume that includes Mr. Richards. You bet. You can count on it. What's your name, my dear? - Barbie. - Barbie? It's just my screen name. I'm really an actress. Yes. Of course you are. Marion. Well, you finally decided to show up! How considerate. Excuse me. Um. Marion, I'm sorry. I was hung up at the station. Oh, don't worry about it, it's no problem. I enjoyed cooking for three hours. I've got nothing else to do. Well, look, I'm sorry. Believe me. I promise, I'll never do it again. I hate those words! Do you know how many times a week I hear those words? Do you? That bad, huh? Uh huh. That bad. Well. What can I say? Nothing. Just nothing at all. Listen, I've got a doctor's appointment, and unlike some people I know, I don't like to be late. Hey, Marion-- uh, what are you going to the doctor for? Don't ask. Don't even ask, OK. And your dinner's on the table, where it was since 9 o'clock last night. It should be really yummy by now. Marion. But-- Ah, don't worry about her, she'll get over it. She always does. You. Name's Billy. How'd you find out where I live? You kidding? How could I forget this place? Hey, what? Never mind, doesn't matter. What do you want? I want to be the best cop in a city, that's what I want. Figure the only way to get there is to learn from the best. What do you say? The hell was that? Lesson one. Stay out of my way. I guess that means no? You sure got away with words, Tucker. Hey! You didn't let me finish. Oh come on. Hey. It's me again. Come on, where are you going? Well, I guess you don't need a lead on that freighter bombing case. What do you got? Name and address of the legal owner of the freighter. What do you get out of this? I told you, man, I just want to ride along. See you in action. What do you say? You drive. All right. And hey, don't scratch the paint. You hit pretty hard-- for a guy your age. Aw, come on, man, what the hell are you doing? That was a great old song. Don't you like music? Yeah, I do. That's why I turned that off. You know, you really ought to be a lot nicer to me. I came a long way to do this with you. Is that right. Yeah. I mean, I thought this would be more fun than this. I'll do my best. Great. Mr. Richards? Yes? John Tucker, Civilian Operated Police. Yes, how can I help you? We understand you're the legal owner of a freighter that was blown up last night. That true? Yes, that's correct, officer. But that particular vessel's been on lease to an offshore corporation for nearly 15 years. I handed all the lease documents over to an Officer Monroe just a few hours ago, and there's really nothing else I can tell you. Thank you. Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Richards. Certainly. Good day, gentlemen. Some lead. Some interrogation. Yeah, well, it's not my strong suit. Right place. Gotta work on our timing. Uh huh. So where to now, boss man? Home in bed. What the hell you talking about? We're just getting close. Look, kid. This is a dead end lead, we got no place else to go. We can't just walk away. See you around, cowboy. What kind of cop are you? Man, we got bad guys to kill. Besides, I'm running out of time. Time? For what? Just time, that's all. This is really no way to start a partnership! I have authorization to interrogate that prisoner. Yeah, I can read. Straight from Mickland's office, hm? My, my, you must be one of those uptown hot shot cops. Where is he? Straight down the hall, first door to your left. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. No guns inside the jail. Of course. Ahh! Ahh! Tony Ginetti. Ahh! Come on. Ah, Mr. Ginetti. I've been expecting you. Excuse us. What? Go do your nails, or try on some clothes, or whatever it is that you do. Just go. OK. Though we've never met, Mr. Ginetti, I understand you've done some fine work for us in the past. Yes, sir. I always try to do my best, Mr. Hoffman. Yes, I'm sure you do. Have a seat, Mr. Ginetti. Sure. OK, I appreciate you guys busting me out and everything. Tell you the truth, I don't think anybody'd give it a try. Quite honestly, Mr. Ginetti, formerly we would not have. But I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with. Sure, anything you say. That officer that arrested you last night, Tucker, I believe it was, what did you say to him? Nothing. Mr. Hoffman, honest, I didn't say nothing. I didn't say a word. It disturbs me greatly to hear that. You see, this Tucker is asking questions. He knows something. I must know what it is. Yeah, well, I didn't say anything. Mr. Ginetti, this weapon has five empty chambers, one full one. Now tell me. How much did you tell Officer Tucker? Nothing. Nothing, I swear it. How much did you tell him? I'm telling you the truth, man. Nothing. How much did you tell him? Nothing. Nothing! Three chambers left, Mr. Ginetti. I don't know what you want. Two chambers left, Mr. Ginetti. Please. Please don't. Two chambers left, Mr. Ginetti. Tell me what you told him. Nothing! I believe you. Get Mickland on the phone. Tuck. Tuck, are you there? I'm right here, Marion. Tuck. Hi. Look, Tuck, I'm sorry how I came down on you so hard on this morning. Oh, that's OK, I probably deserved it. That's true. Well, you don't have to agree with me. Look, I don't want to start anything all over again. I just get the most wonderful news ever. What, did we win the lottery? No, Tuck, it's better than that. What could be better than that? The best thing could ever happen to us. The very best thing. But look, I don't want to talk over this thing. Wait till you get home before I tell you. I'm on my way. I love you, Tuck. Me, too. Whatever it is, forget it. Count me out. I think it's a bit late for that, wouldn't you say? There's really nothing to worry about, all the loose ends have been tied up very neatly. There's just this one little thing that is beginning to bother me. This officer of yours by the name of Tucker. He could become a problem. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said, I'm out and you're on your own. David, let's be sensible. You're the chairman of the civilian operated police, nobody can touch you. Hoffman, the governor and every politician in this state is on my ass about this thing and the public is screaming for blood. And you know something? It's not going to be mine. Now, do you understand it? Yes. Yes, I believe I do. That's good. Did I ever show you this picture, David? Lovely family you've got there, David. Lovely. Funny thing about families. One day they're together, nice and cozy, everything perfect, and the next day, tragedy strikes. And little by little, everything falls apart. Right. What do you want me to do? Hey! I'm home! Hi honey! Huh? Come on, come on, come on, sit down. You stay right here and I'll be right back. Hey, Tucker. What's up, Cindi? Ooh, I've got another hot one for you. Give it to somebody else, I'm off. Oh, I don't think you want to miss this one, Tucker. You know that guy you brought in this morning? He broke out. Killed three cops doing it. Ow. I don't know. But of course, I do know where the gang's hiding out. You want it? You know I do. 15% this time, Tucker. 15%? What happened to 10%? Inflation. So we've got a deal or not? Deal. They're in that warehouse down on 6th Street by the docks. How do you find this stuff out? For 15%, I'd found out anything, Tucker. Good luck. Shit. Tucker! I gotta go. I'll be back as soon as I can, honey. John Tucker, civilian operated police. You have committed a crime and been found guilty. You have a right to die. If you choose to relinquish that right, you will be arrested and imprisoned. What's it going to be, I'm kind of in a hurry. Joke's on you, cop. Wrong. Woo hoo hoo hoo! Hey! Whoa! Woohoo! Come on! Come on, John! How the hell did you know where I was? - How did I know where you were? - Yeah. What the hell kind of question is that? Look, let's start this conversation over again, OK. You go first. Something like, hey, good to see you, Bill, thanks for my ass, Bill. Yeah, I guess I do owe you one, kid. That's it, huh? Well, I guess that's better than nothing. What the hell were you doing back there? It was a setup. They were waiting for me. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Sounds to me like somebody wants you off this case. Figured that out, did you? Tucker? Tucker, are you there? Now's not a good time, Marion. Tuck, you promised to come right home. Marion, I'm a little busy right now. It's very important to me. Tuck, are you listening to me? I'm doing my best. Tuck, are you coming home or not? Why won't you talk to me? Not now, Marion! Then don't bother coming home at all. Shut up! What? I didn't say anything. Keep it that way. I'm getting tired of this shit. Me, too. Now? Time as any. God, I love that. Jesus. Now you tell me exactly how this could happen, because I really want to know. You got me. I had 10 good men waiting for that joker. You're trying to tell me that one cop simply walked through 10 of our men? Seems that way. I know what it seems like, but I have a very difficult time believing it. One cop is not going to stand in my way. You understand, Dugan? I want him taken out. I want him taken out and buried so deep he'll never be found, and I want you to make sure it happens. If you cannot find him, then find a way to get to him. In either case, I will not tolerate another failure in this matter. Do I make myself clear, Mr. Dugan? Absolutely. Where's Cindi? Got me. Home, I guess. What's her address? I can't give it to you, it's against regulations. Yeah, well, so is kicking the shit out of you, but that's what we're going to do if you don't give us her address. Have a nice day. Do you have what I requested? Of course I do. When Mr. Mickland asks me to do something, I just do it. I don't ask questions, I just do it. That's the kind of guy I am. May I have it? Yeah. Yeah, sure. So, uh. What are you guys going to do to Tucker? Going to take him out? That's it, isn't it. Yeah, I bet that's it. Hey, hey, don't worry about me. Like I said, I just do what I'm told. My mouth is shut, I don't know nothing. That's good to hear, Mr. Monroe. Unfortunately, it's just not quite good enough. Hey, come on-- Marion. Marion, are you there? Must be off the hook. Ah, don't worry about her so much. Women always act a little crazy when they're pregnant, you know that. What did you say? I said women always act a little crazy. She didn't tell you, did she? I fucked up. Come on, man, where you going? Got a little stop I want to make first. What the hell are you doing, man? Crazy. First you show up out of nowhere and pull me into this thing. Then I get set up and you just happen to know right where that is. And now you tell me my wife is pregnant before she even tells me about it. I want to know who you are, and where you're from, and what you are, and I want to know it right now, OK. I can't tell you. Well. let me see if I can change your mind. Am I getting through to you? No more freebies. Now don't do that again, because I really don't want to kick your ass. I don't think there will be problem about that, kid. I tried to warn you. Come on. You had enough yet? Uh uh. You? Nah. Just give me a second. OK. I'm from the future. Come on, you gotta do better than that, kid. Look, some friends of mine, they built a time portal. I volunteered to be the guinea pig, they let me choose when and where. So I read up on your cases, they flipped the switch, and here I am, 30 years in the past. You read up on the cases? Well, then you must know who's behind all it. Sure. Jake Hoffman. Why-- why didn't you tell me that the first place? Wouldn't have made any difference. You're going to find out anyway. Besides, it would have ruined all the fun. Oh, yeah, the fun. Let me get this straight. You know everything that's going to happen? No, not really. I mean, not in any detail. You never did fill out reports, John. Hey, uh. Marion's really pregnant? Um. Is it a boy or a girl? Ah! No, never mind, I don't want to know. Come on. Let's go. Ow! Tucker! Tucker! You set me up, Cindi. No, no I did not. I got that information straight out of the main computer. You mean it was planted in there? Had to be. Somebody could put that stuff in there knowing damn well I'd see it first and tip you off. When I heard what happened to you, I went back in to try and trace it. It was gone, Tucker. Just wiped clean, just like it was never there. Must have come from-- Somebody's killing everybody who has any contact with me. Yeah, I've noticed that. Marion. Take the back. You got it. Marion. No way, man. Something's wrong. I mean, something's really wrong. This was not supposed to happen! 30 years from now, man, this house is still here. You sure about that? How do you know? Of course I'm sure, man, I saw it just before I left. Marion? Is she-- No. No, man, she didn't die. I mean, not in my past. What the hell does that mean? I don't know. It means-- things can change. Things can change, because-- because I'm here. That's what it means. Where are you going? I'm going to get drunk! Alone! OK? We just located him. Should be over in a few hours. You just be certain nothing goes wrong. I'm looking forward to the pleasure of killing this Mr. Tucker personally. John Tucker? Who's asking? I got a message from Jake Hoffman. You want to see your wife alive again, you come with us. She's alive. Come on, let's go. You tell Hoffman he's going to die. Second thought, I'll tell him myself. Going someplace? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I've got a meeting with the governor this afternoon. Can we talk about this later? I don't think so. You'll never get it out of the drawer. You set me up, Mickland. You set me up to be killed. Listen, Tucker. I didn't want to do it. They made me do it. Where is he? I don't know. I swear to God I don't know. Listen, I can't tell you. If I do, he'll kill my whole family. 4504 Beverly Glen. If my wife dies. What took you so long? I've been waiting for you all morning. Why didn't you open the damn door for me? More fun watching. Grab some of this stuff, we've got bad guys to catch. You asshole. There's a guy out front, wants to talk to you. Says he can deliver Tucker. Bring him in. Jake, what's happening, man? Who are you? It doesn't really matter who I am. Do you mind? I'm starving, can I have a minute? This stuff looks great. Needs a little bit of garlic, though, wouldn't you say? Shoot him. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jakey! Shooting at the dinner table? Didn't anybody ever teach you any manners? Besides, I brought dessert. Where'd you get that? Ah, but the question is, how are you going to get it back? I got it all. All 200 pounds. What do you want? Bring Tucker's wife to the wharf on 5th Street. One hour. You'll get it all back. Enjoy your meal. Nice dress. Thank you. Shut up. What was your father like, Tucker? Why? Just curious, I guess. Was he like you? Well, he was a cop. LAPD, if that's what you mean. Yeah, mine too. I guess it runs in the blood, huh? I guess so. Do you miss him? Very much. I never knew mine. Know what to do? Everything's been arranged. I hope you enjoy watching your husband die. I certainly will. You're the one that's going to die. Showtime. This place is crawling with snipers. I know. So. I finally come face to face with the dumbest cop in town. Flattery's not going to get you anywhere. A sense of humor. That's good. I understand, Mr. Tucker, that you have something which belongs to me. Where is it? Close. Let's see it. Where's Marion? Dugan. Tucker! Shut up! Five seconds, Tucker, or this gentlemen puts a bullet in her head. Take him out. Do it now. I think now would be a good time. What's he doing? Wait a minute, back them off. Don't do it, Tucker. Send her over, now. Get in the truck, Marion. All right, you've got what you wanted. Now drop the lighter. You heard what the man said. Sure did. Kill him! Get down on the floor, Marion! This ain't getting any better. We better split up. Hoffman! You have the right to die. Use it. I liked that. Hate to spoil all your fun, but it's time to die. You're first, Tucker. There ain't no one left to save you now, Tucker! Billy! Billy! I'm all right, I think. I was supposed to die today, wasn't I? That's why you came back. Run, Marion! Run! Thanks, pal. I don't think I could top that act. Neither do I. Tucker! Either she dies, or you die! It really doesn't matter to me. Drop the gun belts. Drop the gun belts! You shoot her, I shoot you. You're bluffing. Fine. Put it this way, Hoffman. This might be your lucky day. You let her go, you got a second chance to live. Nah. Ahh! Well, time's almost up. I guess I'd better be going. Will we ever see you again? About seven months. You're my-- Who was that? Marion, you'd never believe me. You'd never believe me. Come on, honey. Let's go home. Yeah, sure. Let's go home. Oh, honey, uh. about the house.
