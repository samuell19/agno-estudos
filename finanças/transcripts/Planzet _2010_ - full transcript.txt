Year 2047 IMDO, the International Mars Development Organization, today celebrates the completion of its first Mars colony. In just a short while, it will begin accepting the proposed 500,000 immigrants from Earth. All candidates must pass the IMDO's strict screening process. Hiroshi... What are your plans? My plans? Nothing special. The Earth will be uninhabitable in 10 years anyway... Only a handful of the "chosen" get to go to Mars. You let a failed exam really get to you. That's kind of pathetic. Slouching around at home won't make things better. Hiroshi, you can't go to Mars if you don't study. Just because you get good grades, don't be a smart-ass. Koyomi, you want to live on Mars? Yep. In the future, all three of us will live there. Sure, you'll study hard and build us a big house. I'm counting on you. Listen to you... It looks kind of cushy... Maybe I'll join the military, like you... A bum like you in the military? Don't talk nonsense. Get lost. Akishima here. Understood. I'll be there in 20 minutes. It's an emergency. I've got to leave. For work? What about the movie you promised? I'm sorry, we'll go next week. What's up with her? Sulking about the movie. Look after her while I'm gone. Where did I put it? Where's Dad? He left already. I was going to give him this. Fly Safely Give it to him when he gets back. Honestly, I always thought things would work out. That peace would last forever. But that was a fantasy. Dad left that day, and never came back. In September, 2047 A.D. An unknown asteroid appeared in Earth's orbit. it was named, "Februus". It was a base for some kind of intelligent life, which the military dubbed "FOS". FOS launched an attack on mankind. An international military response had absolutely no effect on them. FOS forces deployed "Thermo-Reactive" weapons to melt the Poles. Sea water levels rose, and most major cities were quickly engulfed. Any remaining cities were burned to the ground. In just 6 days, most of mankind was dead. After that cascade of chaos, in December, a supra-national defense organization was formed, the "Provisional Government of Integrated Planetary Nations". All remaining military strength was formed into the PDFA, "Planetary Defense Forces Alliance". 6 years since the FOS invasion Year 2053 Japan Area United, Fuji Base I joined the struggle against the countless, black hordes. Hey, Akishima, giving up? Wait a sec. I'm not done yet. Lt. Akishima, there's no way you'll get out of that. You owe me 2 potato croquettes. Not again... 24 losses in a row. Sagawa, you're no better. Want to know a great rumor I just heard? More gossip. Someone pulling your leg again? Just listen for Chrissakes. Somewhere in this base... is hidden an ultimate, top-secret weapon. Its code name is "Kairos". It's the decisive weapon. Is it nuclear? We've already seen nukes do nothing against FOS, right? What then? Something far more powerful. - Maybe... - Maybe? Seems like you're having fun. Major Yoshizawa, when did you get back? About 20 minutes ago. Good news for you layabouts, twiddling your thumbs. The Eastern Russian Area Force's "Tunguska" Anti-FOS Offensive has ended in failure. Their army group's been annihilated. Japan Area United is the only one left in the Far East theater. Orders for a 12th Anti-FOS Offensive using our Prototype GL Force have arrived from Superintendent General Yoshizawa's HQ. You'll be briefed at 0900 tomorrow. All pilots to stand by. Headed to actual combat... But... it's so sudden... Keep your hair on. For Chrissakes... We're supposed to be ready for this. Lt. Akishima... about this enemy we're facing, FOS... What do you think it really is? "Extraterrestrial Hostile Intelligent Organisms" by military definition. Some say there's a human cause behind it. Doubting the authorities? Honestly, I don't know what to believe. Don't think too much. For me, FOS is about vengeance for my father. No matter what it is... I just want to kill. Actually my brother was a soldier. He was involved in the design of the Geometric Limbs. So you volunteered to be a pilot? He was my brother, but I hardly knew him. I have no memories of him. But wanting to get to know him better, I enlisted as a GL pilot. Is that it? Yes, but... do I need a grand cause like revenge? Not really, but... I worry whether I can fight or not. I'm not driven by hatred for them... I was sad when my brother died but... Jeez, where's the funeral guys? Capt. Tazaki, how'd you get here? Drinking on stand-by to fly? Booze is banned, you know? Loosen up. Want some? It's home-brewed hooch. As if I'd try anything that suspect. Damn... Made with love for this special day. Let's face it, we're... I won't report the booze, if you grant me 2 hours leave. Where to, at a time like this? It's me. It's been ages. I need to talk. At 0800... I mean, 8pm, are you free? Make an excuse to leave your dorm. Before the FOS attack this was a lively part of town. It's beyond recognition now. A hellish world. For the handful of survivors, without a military connection, they get no help. They face either starvation or a subsistence life of banditry. We're so lucky to have military protection. Although some say we're just cannon-fodder. It's been 2 years. Are you well? How's school? OK, I guess... What's up? There's a big offensive tomorrow. For security reasons, there'll be no evacuation notice. Civilians may get caught in the cross-fire. - Wait a minute... - You must go to Mars. To Mars? Get the Esperanza II Shuttle tomorrow. I'll send a buddy to meet you at 9am. Get ready to evacuate. Don't forget your passport, credit card and military-issued ID. - How about you? - You're going on your own. I don't want to go to Mars alone. You have to get out of here. Military family members get priority. Why don't you leave, too? You said it's dangerous. Because I'm a soldier. A soldier? So was Dad and that's why he died. You'll die, too. I'll avenge Dad. That's a lie. You only joined-up to get his approval, right? But it's all too late now. You're a fool. Focus on your own survival. Me and Dad is none of your business. We shut down the Diffuser. What the hell do you mean? Opinion is not required. You're all aware, the Diffuser is a plasma defense screen protecting the world and preventing FOS from entering our atmosphere. Of course! So why shut it down? 3 years ago, HQ had the Research Division fast-track adaptation of the Diffuser from terra-forming technology. However... they only did a makeshift job. You know where the Diffuser gets its massive energy needs from? Nope... Right here! In the heart of the Fuji Base. Inside this base is the world's most powerful generator. I've always suggested we use it, not in passive defense but to attack the enemy on Februus. Then last month we completed work on a Converged Energy Assault Canon, the D-Cannon. Is that the one? I guess so. Civilian intelligence has just announced, the receipt of information about a large-scale military offensive. Neither the PDFA nor the government has released any official statement. It is assumed the secrecy is to avoid civil unrest. Between the shield shut down and cannon firing, there's a slight time lag. The enemy will try to exploit this and will surely launch a direct assault. The D-Cannon needs 14 mins & 40 secs. Your mission is to defend the base at all costs. This is the strategy for today's final anti-FOS offensive Its code name is "Plan-Zet". "Planzet"? Analysis of our previous offensives shows that our enemy possesses adaptive intelligence. In other words, they're "smart". So any specialist weapon systems or strategies used before will be ineffective. Hence the development of the armored mobile attack vehicles, we call the Geometric Limbs. These are the weapons you will pilot. In other words, while you get your D-Cannon thing ready to fire, we just buy time, right? That's correct. The D-Cannon's durability is such, that it can only fire once. This will be mankind's last assault against FOS. Destroying their base will finish the war. However, if we fail, human life will be over. The end of mankind... Training you three to this level, cost the same as building an entire star ship. Prove to us that the 2 years was worth it. That woman pisses me off. That hit the spot. Superintendent General Yoshizawa's daughter becomes a major in the Combined Fleet. The military elite family connection, huh? Jealous or something? No way! High rank or title mean nothing. I know what you mean but, the higher-ups always have the best chances of survival. Isn't your sister, Koyomi? She just got into the Military Academy, right? She's got an elite future ahead, too. Maybe she'll turn out like our beloved Major? Quit it, will you? For a kid to have a chance in life, putting her in a military facility was the only option I had. I lost my wife, daughter and parents. Take good care of your sister. It's an order, understood? Yes, I intend to do so. Anything wrong? Your sister's not here. Where's she got to? Did you look for her? What the hell is she thinking? Commence energy diversion from Diffuser to D-Cannon. All GL pilots, stand by for take-off. We have visitors. All Geometric Limbs, take-off. Let 'em taste our hospitality! Koyomi... Aiming the big gun at our base, huh? Ignore the small fry. Get the mother ship! Affirmative. I'll keep the fighters busy. Hit the carrier. Good, go! Piece of cake! The simulator was way harder. Distance, 14,200... Wind direction, 86 degrees. Speed, 31 knots... Why don't you shoot? - The wind's too strong. - Shoot, damn it! They're acting as shields. Come on, keep shooting! Out of ammo. No back-up mags, Captain. Damn, I'm out, too! That was close... The GLs don't stand a chance for close-in combat. Not now! Behind you! Kaori! Brother... I'm sorry... Sagawa! Kaori! You bastards! Wait, you idiot. They killed my father, too! You forgetting my order? What are you doing? I can't let you die! Captain Tazaki! Take good care of your sister. Captain! Goddamn it... Why? No enemy detected within 100 kms of base. All wings return to base. Capt. Tazaki and Lt. Sagawa are... I know. It's a small price to pay. A small price? My father killed a space monster 28 years ago, and was worshiped as a savior. He then rose to the top of the military. As daughter to that kind of man, no matter what I do or where I go, people assume I ride his coat-tails. The success of this operation will secure my reputation. I'll show those useless bastards on Mars! How come? Why? How am I different from my father? Is this the limit of my ability? What's a child doing here? My brother... Where's Lieutenant Akishima? No idea... Koyomi. Hiroshi! You fool, why are you here? What's going on? Pull the trigger, Akishima. Plan-Zet has failed. It's the end of everything. If you won't shoot... Why did you do that? What's the point of dying? Taking responsibility for your troops? Responsibility? Don't make me laugh. You wouldn't understand what this war really means to me. Since I failed to destroy the FOS I've no more reason to live. What nonsense! Does life mean nothing to you? Sagawa and Captain Tazaki died! But you're still here and must protect this base. I wish I could praise their honorable deaths but sadly they died in vain. The enemy will soon take over Earth. What's that? Time remaining before the base self-destructs. There's no stopping the sequence. Why are you doing this? This is... ...my last mission. Koyomi. The base will explode in 2 mins & 50 seconds. Can we get out? It's less than 3 minutes. There's an underground shelter. It's our only hope. Nothing happened. - What? - What's that? I am Superintendent General Yoshizawa. The fact that this image is being played means the strategic situation is lost. But do not despair yet. Where you stand now isn't a shelter. It's the control room of Kairos, our last resort. Kairos? We're inside it? Kairos is a double-edged sword. Thus I wanted this only for defense and never as a weapon of attack. That is the nature of the Diffuser. But now it must be too late for that. I am ordering you to deploy Kairos. No, this is not an order. I entrust you with the last hope of mankind. The Kairos System follows the operator's thoughts. The power of a strong will, will vanquish our enemy. I pray you will bring about a second chance for humanity. Hey! Koyomi. Head out that way. What about you? Brother? I have to go. Why? We've been lucky to survive. Why do you have to take more risks? You still want to avenge Dad? It's not that. Dad's not coming back. But that doesn't mean I can't do anything. I don't get it... If we do nothing, the Earth will be destroyed. All our memories and dreams... our everyday lives...gone. As if they never existed. Aren't I right? But you don't have to be the one to do it. Somebody else will... It doesn't have to be you. Isn't that right? Koyomi... I am that "somebody". There are times others can do it... But there are also times no-one else can. I was given something precious by Dad and my colleagues. And now, I'm giving it back. I'm off. I'm coming, too. I'll come with you. - Koyomi. - Slap me if you like. But I'm not moving from here. Why...? Because I believe in you. And... because we're family. Koyomi. What is it? An enemy attack. Once we're done, we go home. And I'll take you to a movie. It's my treat. Don't you dare forget. Kairos, take off. Target the asteroid, Februus. Go, Kairos. Kairos beam. Deploy Diffuser! We can't get close enough. What can we do? Maybe it'll dismantle itself entirely. We can't wait for that to happen. We've lost the Diffuser! Great, it's coming towards us. Great, it's coming towards us. My beam's out... Look down! Damn. Is it trying to smash us into the Earth. The impact of something this big... ...will destroy the entire world. It's getting hot... Is it trying to bake us? Koyomi! Hold on. Brother... Dad's safety charm... Koyomi! Dad... Help us, please. I beg you. Is this the end? Is it no use? Is all we've done for nothing? Why? Dad... What should I do? Dad? Help me! Don't be so spoiled. How dare you? It's your world. It's up to you to defend it! If not now, when? If you've got life in you, fight! Hiroshi!! Koyomi... Hold on... Thank you... Koyomi... Thank the lord... You're awake. I've been out about 3 days? Maybe 30 minutes. Major... Why? Must there be a reason? Maybe it's not for you. Remember what you said? That you'd take me to a movie... Not that any are playing. I knew that, silly. But they will one day. Without a doubt.
