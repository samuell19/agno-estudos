Are you staying in tonight? David! Didn't you hear me? Sure, I did. Well? I'm going out. My instinct is dead certain. I was born under a lucky star. The sky over Europe turned violet, and there were thick yellow Sahara sands. That's what my mother told me. Hello! Hey, come here. How about a little fun? Hold on! Why d' you look so starved? Wanna come along? You aren't even looking, kid. Sure, I am. Quit fooling with your bike. Deaf? What? You coming? No. C'mon. I don't feel like it. Don't you wanna sleep with me? No. Fifty marks in a car. Where's a car? Forty. Hands off, you bastard! This is getting ridiculous. Does your cast ache? Bullshit. Got any money? Can you lend me a cigarette?

Come here, Kurt. What the hell? Kurt, Kurt... Kurt, Kurt! What're we gonna do now? We oughta leave right now. Hm? And move to a totally dif f erent place. Where did you get that idea? Just did. Do you think we're together now? Yeah. We didn't even sleep with each other. You'd better go now. Get lost! Goon! Just give me one reason why I should go with you? I have tattoos. Bullshit. Where? You can't see 'em now. They really screwed you when they said girls go for tattoos. Are you coming? You're crazy. You hear me? You're crazy. Hey, what're you doing? Shutting the door. What's your name anyway? David. Bye! Idiot! The accident happened at work! Yeah, sure! Now fuck off, or there's gonna be another accident! Get Harald. I'll take you to court! I'll do it! Harald, get the dog. I got papers. C'mon! Show me! Go home to Mommy! Gimme the money! What's up, Harald? My money! You get nothing! C'm o n! C'm o n! Now you're gonna stay right here! Let that poor dog loose. Hey, what about the money? Hey, stay! Hey! What're you doing here? Can you lend me your car? What?... No! You can't stay here. I didn't want to. I'm working. Got a problem? Don't mind him. He's nuts. What d' you need the car for? Gotta think something over. You only think in cars? More or less. Are you even 187 Sure thing. Wanna see? Here. Why does it say Bruno? I thought your name was David. Yeah, Bruno. Bruno, shitty name. So I call myself David. It's better. It's no fake either. Understand? Wanna come along? What'll you do for work? I can always find a job. That's a great career! I'm in recycling. What do you do? At a scrapyard. But I'm that kind of guy. Sure. A real winner. I'm not gonna give you my car. I gotta work. This is where I live. I'm leaving for sure. Thirty minutes are up! Five more minutes. I wasn't finished. Hey, can't we do it again? Are you crazy? My mother! Can we leave now? What's your name? What's your name? It's all too expensive here. I got enough money. A hundred what? 128 marks. Here. Thanks. Hey, look. What? Wow! Unforgettable. Do you trust me? Sure, I do. But you shouldn't. Let me worry about that. Got any money? That's bad. Why? Didn't you bring any with you? No. I told you. I don't have any money. That's why I was looking for a job. Well? Nothing. Fuckin' shit! What did we get this room for? You said you could get a job anywhere! No, I can't. What do you mean? Because of the cast. You knew that! No. I forgot all about it. Totally. You forgot it? You forgot your cast? That's why I didn't wanna buy that stuff at the gas station. It was way too expensive. No wonder we're outta money. My money! This is okay. You play the john. Otherwise they won't get it. Well... What should I do? Never done it before? With a prostitute? It's easy. Hey, watch out with the car! How am I supposed to drive anyway? How much? It depends. You can go. Time's up. What's up? Just a sec. How much? Count it! That's a lot. Bullshit. You're all bruised. Don't look at it. What did they do to you? Those fucking reclining seats! Gimme a cigarette. It looks terrible. C'mon. Kiss me there. It f eels good. Do it. It f eels good. No, I can't. You gotta do something, too! No, I don't! Yes, you do! Touch me again. Don't stop. Don't stop. It's over now. I hate them. Some of them ask if I got a boyfriend. Yeah. They like that. It makes 'em think I'm not so sick or something. They're all assholes. Keep doing it. What do you think about when you sleep with them? Usually about a dog. Or I look out the window. Do they touch you everywhere? Not there. Shit! Come here. You're a good dog. Hit the road? Deposit it, please. What do you do with them? With who? You gotta be kidding. Don't you know what a whore does? Not exactly. What do you think? Sleep with 'em. Like with other men? It's different. No! I don't believe it! Fucking machine! Hey, get down here right away! The machine is fucked up! Here! Get down here, you... you night man! The machine's totally fucked up! What are you sitting there for? If my wife gets cold, or my friend Kurt... Then we'll start a fire here. Right here! And we'll burn everything down! You're new here, aren't you? Let me tell you a joke. What does an Irishman do? In Ireland, just hills and grass... Not a soul around. What does an Irishman do when he wants to see a peep show? He's really horny and wants to jack off. What does he do? He takes wool from his sheep. We don't have wool. We'll use tobacco instead. And then... He spreads his fingers and puts the wool in here. He sticks it on with spit. Go on, moisten it. Make it really wet. Now he has to make it come to life. Hello? Hi, Mom. No, I didn't run away. No, everything happened so fast. It's an old voodoo trick. Close your eyes. Close your eyes! And now... It's peep show time. The woman has to do something, too. Yeah. Yeah, I met a girl. Or you can shave it. They really go for that. She wanted a smoke. A smoke! You see what smoking's good for. Not until I say when. C'm on! Come in. Good evening. Sit down. Do you like me? Yeah. Really? This stuff is so perverse. I think it's sexy. Don't touch me like that, David. You've gotta go. Don't touch me. Hey! Don't touch me! Please, don't touch me. It won't work. I don't need it. Get lost! Don't touch me! Yes! David. I don't need any love. Don't need it. What's wrong? I can't do it. I just can't. I don't understand a thing! Get out. No, I won't. Go on. Move it. Come here, Kurt. Where am I supposed to go anyway? The money! The money and the card! It's my money! I won't have anything left! I don't care! C'm on! Why do you wanna go with him? With a jerk like him? Come here. C'mon. That David was a nice guy, wasn't he? Good evening. Time to go. You gotta leave. Get moving. Move it! He's new here. He's new here! It's warmer there. Yeah, education! You gotta use your old noggin. You oughta start in the summer, in the summer not in the winter. Not with those shoes. That doesn't fit! And not with those shoes. Yeah, experience, professional experience. Why did he go away? What an idiot. Forget him. What're you getting at? You called him an idiot. Shut your fucking mouth! He was... He was okay. Hey! Stop it! Hey! Get outta here, you pig! Hey. That's my jacket! Sit. Stay here, Kurtie. She said you'd left. Wrong. I see. Did I really throw you out? You started shouting. You cried. I don't remember. Then I had to give you all the money. All of it! But how! I had no idea at all. I was frightened. I thought you'd run away. What are those drawings? Which drawings? There. It's a dragon. What? Underneath. You can't see it. What's underneath? Tattoos. Admit it. Admit it! I'm not gonna admit anything! You can't see them. Don't move. You can't see them. That's why they're on top. Money sucks. All this money. \We don't need it. We'd be better of f without it. Duisburg is a great town. I'll do it for you. What if I don't want it? It's good for you. They're driving you crazy. I don't wanna work at some checkout for 5 or 9 marks an hour. Don't do anything. I'll manage things. Just imagine that everybody gets born again. And everybody is like half a butterfly. What? You put two together and clack! You got a butterfly. I really think so. And they always flap around like butterflies. Because couples never agree. Most of 'em... Most of 'em are too busy fighting they can't even agree on a flower. Then they're dead in two hours. Even the best of couples flap around like that. They can't agree on anything either. Have you ever seen a butterfly that flies straight? No. You see. Yeah? You really think so? Yeah. Sure. Hello. Deposit it, please. Put the stuff you can't cut over there. You know the routine. The boss decides when it's raining. He can see it from his office window. Otherwise we'd have to shut the place down. It's always raining. You'd always be on a break. Any questions? I work 12 hours, don't 1? It's up to you. Sure. It's more money. What's wrong with your arm? Nothing. I broke it. Can you lift with it? Show me. No, with this one. Nope, use your left arm instead. David's gonna be here soon. It's cold! Hi. How was it? Really wild. Good. Here Open it. Our money. Good, huh? Were you at home? All day? It was warm, huh? It's better to be at home. Are you hungry?

That's all I can earn at the scrapyard! There's no way! But Kurt was really badly injured. And how are you gonna pay for it? I can't change my ways. Yes, you can. A sausage with curry sauce. No way! Now we're gonna go big time A real business. Oh yes! And then we'll get rich, David. We will! No! Yeah! Do you wanna fuck me? What? Do you wanna fuck me? Sorry. Now that's a completely diff erent story. Hey, what's up? I'm sexy , a r e n't 1?7 Tell me! C'mon! Do you think I'm sexy? You gotta help me now. She's good, isn't she? Yeah. No, maybe for other guys.
