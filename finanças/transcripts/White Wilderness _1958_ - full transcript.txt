THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO DURING THAT PERIOD OF GEOLOGIC TIME KNOWN AS THE ICE AGE, THE ENTIRE TOP OF OUR GLOBE WAS COVERED BY A VAST GLACIER. ITS ICY FINGERS REACHED DEEP INTO NORTH AMERICA, ACROSS THE SEAS INTO EUROPE, AND DOWN ALONG THE FROZEN PLAINS OF SIBERIA. IN FACT, 1/4 OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE WAS IMPRISONED IN ITS IRON GRIP. THIS GIGANTIC ICE CAP WAS 2 MILES THICK, AND ITS CRUSHING WEIGHT FLATTENED WHOLE MOUNTAIN RANGES AND GOUGED OUT DEEP VALLEYS ON THE FACE OF THE LAND. THE ICE AGE CHANGED NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE EARTH, BUT ALL LIFE EXISTING IN THOSE TIMES. EVERY SPECIES HAD TO ADAPT ITSELF TO THE BITTER COLD OR PERISH. MANY CREATURES, OF COURSE, DID NOT SURVIVE, AND WE KNOW THEM TODAY ONLY FROM PICTURES DRAWN BY PREHISTORIC MAN IN THE CAVES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE. IN THESE GALLERIES OF ANCIENT ART, WE FIND SOME SURPRISINGLY GRAPHIC PORTRAITS. FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S AN EXTINCT RHINOCEROS, EQUIPPED WITH LONG HAIR TO WITHSTAND THE COLD, AND A FUR-BEARING ELEPHANT KNOWN AS THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH. THERE ARE MASTODONS INSULATED WITH A THICK HIDE CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL PACHYDERMS AND HUGE, SHAGGY BISONS COVERED WITH A PROTECTIVE COAT OF THICK FUR. IN SPITE OF THESE ADAPTATIONS, HOWEVER, THE HARSH CONDITIONS PROVED TOO MUCH, AND THESE CREATURES GRADUALLY DIED OUT, LEAVING ONLY THESE PICTORIAL LEGENDS TO MARK THEIR PASSING. THE ARCTIC HAS FOREVER BEEN A LEGENDARY LAND, AND EVEN TODAY, THERE EXIST HERE LIVING LEGENDS, CREATURES ABOUT WHICH MAN KNOWS SO LITTLE, THEY SEEM A BLEND OF MYTH AND MYSTERY. IN THIS TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURE, WE SHALL FIND THEM CONTINUING THEIR ICE AGE EXISTENCE. THIS IS A STORY OF LIFE MEETING AND CONQUERING THE BLEAKEST ENVIRONMENT ON EARTH. IN THE HIDDEN, UNMAPPED VALLEYS OF THIS WHITE WILDERNESS, THE VAST GLACIERS STILL LIE AT REST, SEEMINGLY IMMOBILE. AND YET, OVER THE YEARS, THEY INCH THEMSELVES ALONG JUST AS THEY DID AGES AGO. TIME IS ETERNITY HERE AND HAS LITTLE MEANING. YET, IN MARCH, THE MONTH OF THE EQUINOX, THE SUN LIFTS ABOVE THE SOUTHERN HORIZON. THIS TOUCH OF WARMTH, WEAK AS IT IS, CAUSES THIS LAND OF SNOW AND ICE TO UNDERGO A CHANGE. THE ANNUAL THAW BEGINS FEEBLY, DROPLET BY DROPLET, GRADUALLY INCREASING IN POWER AND SCOPE. IN TIME, THE DROPLETS BECOME RIVULETS, SOON, THE RIVULETS BECOME STREAMS. THEN THE STREAMS TURN INTO FAIR-SIZED TORRENTS, ALL RUSHING TOWARD THE VALLEYS BELOW, ALL DESTINED EVENTUALLY TO EMPTY INTO THE ARCTIC SEA. HIGH ON THE MOUNTAINTOPS, THE THAW TAKES ON SPECTACULAR PROPORTIONS. THESE THUNDERING AVALANCHES ARE RARELY VIEWED BY HUMAN EYES, AND YET, EVER SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, THEY'VE BEEN A PART OF THIS ANNUAL PHENOMENON. INDEED, THIS IS WHAT THE ICE AGE MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN -- GIGANTIC WATERFALLS OF LIVING SNOW POURING INTO THE VALLEYS BELOW. AROUND THE FULL SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, THE ICE-BOUND RIVERS, LIKE THE YUKON IN ALASKA, THE MACKENZIE IN NORTHERN CANADA, THE LENA IN SIBERIA, ALL BEGIN TO FEEL THE THRUST AND PUSH OF THE UPLAND DRAINAGE. TINY PROBING TRICKLES OF WATER UNDERCUT THEIR SOLID SURFACE. THE FIRST TELLTALE CRACKS APPEAR, SIGNS OF THE STRESSES AND STRAINS GOING ON BELOW. THE CREVICES WIDEN AND TRAVEL. SOMETHING MUST GIVE. NOW THE RIVERS CARRY GRINDING TOOLS OF THEIR OWN, GREAT BOULDERS OF ICE THAT WEIGH HUNDREDS OF TONS. IN THEIR TUMBLING JOURNEY DOWNSTREAM, THESE BECOME THE BATTERING RAMS WITH WHICH THE RIVERS ATTACK THE GLACIERS. THE RIVERS HAVE WON THE BATTLE. WINTER'S GRIP, AT LAST, IS BROKEN. AND JUST AS THESE CURRENTS QUICKEN, SO DOES THE PULSEBEAT OF LIFE ITSELF. NOW ALL THINGS LIVING IN THIS WHITE WILDERNESS MUST PREPARE FOR A PERIOD OF HECTIC ACTIVITY. THE TIME AHEAD MUST BE LIVED AT A DESPERATE, ALMOST DOUBLE-QUICK TEMPO, FOR THIS ICE AGE SCENE WILL BE RELEASED FOR ONLY THE BRIEFEST OF SUMMERS. IT'S IN THE ARCTIC SEA THAT THE FIRST SIGNS OF LIFE APPEAR -- FAMILIES OF WALRUS EAGER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE REOPENED CHANNELS. LIKE SCHOOLS OF OVERSIZED FISH, THEY SWIM AND DIVE IN THE DARK DEPTHS, TRAVELING THROUGH THE WATER WITH AMAZING SKILL AND SPEED. WHEN THE EARLY-DAY NORSE SAILORS FIRST SAW THIS STRANGE BEAST, THEY CALLED IT THE HVALROSS, OR WHALE HORSE, AND IT'S REMAINED A SORT OF SEA MONSTER EVER SINCE. ACTUALLY AS LARGE AS A HORSE, THE WALRUS IS ONE OF THOSE WARM-BLOODED MAMMALS DESTINED TO SPEND ITS DAYS IN THE OCEAN. BUT TO SURVIVE IN THIS ELEMENT, IT HAS DEVELOPED FINS FOR FEET, A THICK LAYER OF BLUBBER FOR INSULATION AGAINST THE COLD, AND ENORMOUS TUSKS FOR GATHERING FOOD. THESE SERVE AS A SORT OF CLAM RAKE, FOR THE WALRUS LIVES ON SHELLFISH, WHICH HE GATHERS ON THE OCEAN BOTTOM. HIS DIET INCLUDES CLAMS, STARFISH, SHRIMP, AND MOLLUSKS. INDEED, TO KEEP A WALRUS CONTENTED, IT TAKES A SEAFOOD COCKTAIL THE SIZE OF A WASHTUB. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE LIVES IN THE SEA, THE WALRUS LIKES THE FEEL OF SUNSHINE. AFTER ALL, HE IS WARM-BLOODED, AND SO THESE BARE ISLANDS BECOME A FAVORITE BASKING GROUND. HE MUCH PREFERS A SUN-WARMED ROCK, NO MATTER HOW CROWDED, TO THE MOST SPACIOUS OF ICEBERGS. BESIDES, ICEBERGS ARE TRICKY. THEY HAVE A WAY OF ROLLING RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER A FELLOW. EVEN THOUGH HE'S PERFECTLY AT HOME IN THE WATER, THE WALRUS CAN'T SWIM INDEFINITELY. AND THE YOUNGSTERS, ESPECIALLY, MUST STAY CLOSE TO A GOOD LANDING PLACE. THIS MATTER OF GOING INTO DRY DOCK CALLS FOR A GOOD SENSE OF TIMING AND A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION AS TO WHICH WAVE TO RIDE. FOR THE BEGINNER AT 100 POUNDS, IT ISN'T ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT. BUT FOR THE ADULTS AT 2,000 POUNDS, IT TAKES A BIT OF HUFFING AND PUFFING. THE WALRUS IS A THICK-SKINNED CREATURE. IN FACT, HIS HIDE MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM 1/2 AN INCH TO 3 INCHES THROUGH. AND IN LOUNGING AROUND ON SHARP ROCKS, THIS TOUGH EXTERIOR PROVIDES WELCOME PROTECTION. IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY UNMIXED BLESSING, HOWEVER. SOMETIMES A FELLOW GETS AN ITCH AMONG ALL THOSE WRINKLES, AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, HE'S GOT PROBLEMS. ON THESE LOUNGING ROCKS, SPACE IS DEFINITELY LIMITED, SO A LITTLE OVERCROWDING IS TO BE EXPECTED. BUT NO BOTHER. INDEED, IF A WALRUS CAN PILLOW HIS HEAD ON A NEIGHBOR, HE RATHER PREFERS THE ARRANGEMENT -- SORT OF LIKE SLEEPING ON A BLUBBER-FILLED MATTRESS. IT'S NOT EVERY NEIGHBOR THAT ENJOYS BEING A MATTRESS, HOWEVER, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BITTER ARGUMENTS BREAK OUT. NOW THE TUSKS OF THE MIGHTY BULLS BECOME SLASHING SABERS THAT CAN GOUGE AND TEAR AND CUT. IN FACT, THERE'S HARDLY A MATURE BULL IN THE COLONY THAT DOESN'T BEAR THE WOUND STRIPES OF THESE BAD-TEMPERED EXCHANGES. SUDDENLY, THE SQUABBLING STOPS. SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A NEIGHBORHOOD BRAWL SENDS PANIC THROUGH THE HERD, AND IN A SINGLE INSTANT, THIS LAZY SCENE IS CHANGED TO ONE OF SEETHING TURMOIL. THE CAUSE OF IT ALL IS THE POLAR BEAR -- KING OF THE ARCTIC AND MORTAL ENEMY OF THE WALRUS TRIBE. OF ALL THE LEGENDARY CREATURES OF THE FAR NORTH, THE POLAR BEAR IS THE ONE WHO SEEMS THE SYMBOL OF THIS GHOSTLY LAND. LIKE A WHITE PHANTOM, HE MOVES THROUGH HIS REALM, AN EVER-PRESENT MENACE, FOR HE DOES NOT HIBERNATE. HE'S BEEN CALLED BY MANY NAMES -- THE SPIRIT BEAR OF THE NORTH, THE ICE BEAR, THE BEAR OF THE SEA. HE'S ALL OF THESE AND MORE -- THE LARGEST, MOST POWERFUL, MOST FEROCIOUS CARNIVORE IN THE ENTIRE WHITE WILDERNESS. HE'S QUITE LITERALLY AN OCEANGOING BEAR AND THINKS NOTHING OF CROSSING VAST STRETCHES OF OPEN WATER TO REACH HIS HUNTING GROUNDS OUT ON THE ICE PACK. PROTECTED FROM THE COLD BY A WATERPROOF COAT OF FUR AND A THICK LAYER OF FAT, HE CAN TRAVEL LIKE THIS FOR HOURS ON END. INDEED, HE'LL OFTEN SWIM 20 MILES IN ORDER TO GET FROM ONE ICEBERG TO ANOTHER. WHENEVER A POLAR BEAR IS IN THE VICINITY, THE WALRUS ARE UNEASY AND QUICKLY ROUTED FROM THEIR CUSTOMARY SLUMBER. ACTUALLY, THE POLAR BEAR RARELY TAKES ON AN ADULT WALRUS, FOR THE BULLS OUTWEIGH HIM BY ALMOST HALF A TON. HIS PROPER PREY IS THE SEAL, AND YET, THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE HE'LL COME UPON A BABY WALRUS OR A CRIPPLE. SO HE CAN'T RESIST THIS AGE-OLD CHASE. SOON, THE BEAR GIVES UP THE PURSUIT. IT WAS ONLY A SORT OF HALF-HEARTED EFFORT ON HIS PART, ANYWAY. HE JUST WANTED TO TEST HIS PROWESS. THERE'LL BE ANOTHER DAY. FOR THE KING OF THE ARCTIC, THERE ALWAYS IS. THERE IS ONE OCCASION WHEN THE POLAR BEARS MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO THEIR GENERAL RULE OF NOT HIBERNATING. THE FEMALE, WHEN EXPECTING CUBS, WILL PASS THE WINTER HOLED UP IN A SHELTERED SNOW CAVE. AND HERE'S A MOTHER BEAR NOW WITH A PAIR OF NEWBORN YOUNGSTERS THAT MIGHT WELL BE TWINS. ALTHOUGH MOTHER STILL REPOSES DEEP IN SLUMBER, HER NEW BABIES ARE WIDE AWAKE AND NOW ARE INTERESTED IN BREAKFAST. FROM TIME TO TIME DURING THE WINTER, IN FACT, THEY'VE NURSED LIKE THIS WITHOUT DISTURBING THE MATERNAL NAP. AT BIRTH, THEY WERE PRACTICALLY NAKED AND HAVE ONLY MANAGED TO SURVIVE THE BITTER COLD BY BURROWING INTO THEIR MOTHER'S THICK FUR. BY NOW, HOWEVER, THEY'VE GROWN A RESPECTABLE POLAR BEAR COAT OF THEIR OWN, AND THEY FEEL PERFECTLY PREPARED TO EXPLORE THE GREAT OUTDOORS. AND SO WITH THE CURIOSITY OF ALL YOUNG ANIMALS, THEY VENTURE OUT INTO THE STRANGE ARCTIC WORLD WHICH IS TO BE THEIR HOME. THIS BLEAK SETTING COULD WELL BE THE FACE OF THE MOON. YET, TO THESE ARCTIC CHILDREN, IT'S THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PLAYGROUND ONE COULD POSSIBLY DESIRE. ON EVERY DOWNHILL SLOPE, THERE'S A PLACE FOR FUN. IN EVERY ICE FORMATION, THERE'S A SECRET CAVE WHERE A COUPLE OF SMALL BEARS CAN PLAY A GAME OF AMBUSH AND ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE. CUBS OF ALL AGES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THIS ARCTIC WASTELAND, AND HERE, A SLIGHTLY OLDER PAIR IS OUT FOR A STROLL, TOO. BUT EVEN THESE HAVEN'T LOST THE BEAR'S INNATE SENSE OF PLAY. OF ALL THE ANIMALS IN NATURE, THE BEAR IS ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT, AND ALONG WITH INTELLECT COMES WHAT AMOUNTS TO A SENSE OF HUMOR. THUS, WHEN ONE CUB CAN SET UP ANOTHER CUB AS A TARGET FOR A SNOWBALL, HE'S QUICK TO SEE THE HUMOROUS POTENTIAL OF THE SITUATION. OOPS! A NEAR MISS. WELL, PERHAPS HE CAN MANEUVER HIS PAL WITHIN RANGE AGAIN. NOW, AMMUNITION READY. AIM... BULL'S-EYE! LIKE HIS COUSINS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE POLAR BEAR HAS INHERITED CERTAIN TREE-CLIMBING TENDENCIES. BUT HIS PROBLEM UP HERE IS THERE ISN'T A TREE WITHIN 1,000 MILES. SO HE TAKES IT OUT ON THE BIGGEST HILL HE CAN FIND. THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT MOUNTAIN CLIMBING THAT THESE INEXPERIENCED YOUNGSTERS HAVE YET TO LEARN -- HOW TO TEST A FOOTING, HOW TO CHOOSE THE ANGLE OF APPROACH, AND, MOST OF ALL, HOW TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. BUT WHEN THE LONG TOBOGGAN RIDE BEGINS, THERE'S NO PLACE TO STOP BUT THE BOTTOM. AND NOW ANOTHER ARCTIC YOUNGSTER SETS OUT TO EXPLORE THE SURROUNDING ICE PACK. THIS IS THE RINGED SEAL, THE MOST COMMON SPECIES FOUND IN THESE NORTHERN WASTES. IN ITS INFANCY, THE PUP WEARS A COAT OF PUREST WHITE THAT SERVES AS A NATURAL CAMOUFLAGE IN THIS DOMAIN OF WHITENESS. CAMOUFLAGE ALONE, HOWEVER, IS SMALL PROTECTION OUT ON THE ICE. AND AS HE DRAGS HIMSELF OVER THE ROUGH TERRAIN, THIS LITTLE TRAVELER IS PAINFULLY AWKWARD AND SLOW. INDEED, A SEAL ON TOP OF THE ICE IS LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER. HE'S NOT ONLY CLUMSY, BUT EXTREMELY VULNERABLE, FOR HERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY ALL POLAR BEARS WAIT FOR. AND IF THE SEAL IS DISCOVERED IN THIS SITUATION, HE HAS NO DEFENSE WHATEVER. ONCE IN HIS ELEMENT, HOWEVER, HE BECOMES AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CREATURE. NOW HE'S THE MASTER OF DEFENSIVE MANEUVER. HIS REAR FINS SERVE AS FINE FISH-TAIL PADDLES, AND HIS STREAMLINED SHAPE IS THE PERFECT DESIGN FOR CUTTING THROUGH THE WATER. THIS POOL OF MELTED ICE WATER BECOMES HIS PERSONAL SWIMMING HOLE, THE PLACE WHERE HE CAN AMUSE HIMSELF FOR HOURS ON END. SOMETIMES THE BULLIES FROM DOWN THE BLOCK COME AROUND TO TRY TO SPOIL HIS FUN. INSTINCTIVELY, THE POLAR BEAR CUB RECOGNIZES HIS NATURAL PREY, AND HE MAKES A GOOD TRY FOR IT. BUT FOR HIM TO CATCH A SEAL THIS EARLY IN HIS CAREER IS RATHER LIKE A TUGBOAT RUNNING DOWN A TORPEDO. THERE MUST BE SEALS AROUND HERE THAT ARE EASIER TO CORNER THAN THIS ONE. HMM. THE CUBS DECIDE MAYBE THEY'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. MAYBE THEY'D BETTER GO CHECK UP WITH THEIR MOTHER. AH, NOW, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT. HERE'S REAL OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS KNOWN AS TRADING ON YOUR FATHER'S REPUTATION. SO STRONG IS THE TERROR INSPIRED BY THE POLAR BEAR THAT EVEN HIS CUBS CAN STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE WALRUS. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE A BIT SHORT ON WEIGHT AND SIZE, THE CUBS HAVE PLENTY OF COURAGE TO BACK UP THEIR BLUFF. AND SOON, THEY'VE MADE THIS HUGE BULL GIVE UP HIS FAVORITE NAPPING PLACE. WITH HER CUBS LOCATED AT LAST, THE MOTHER BEAR IS READY FOR A HUNTING EXPEDITION OF HER OWN. AND SINCE HER YOUNGSTERS HAVE MANAGED TO SCARE ALL THE PREY OUT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, SHE AND HER FAMILY MUST TRY THEIR LUCK ELSEWHERE. THE ARCTIC OCEAN IS A SEA OF MYSTERY, AND BECAUSE IT'S FREE OF ICE ONLY PART OF THE YEAR, RARELY CAN WE GAIN A GLIMPSE OF THE PUZZLES HIDDEN IN ITS DARK DEPTHS. BUT HERE WE MAY WITNESS ONE NOW -- THE AMAZING BEHAVIOR OF THE WHITE WHALES. IN THE KINGDOM OF THE WHALES, THE BELUGA, OR WHITE WHALE, IS NOT A LARGE BREED. IT GROWS TO A MAXIMUM LENGTH OF 16 FEET AND RARELY EXCEEDS A TON IN WEIGHT. IT'S ACTUALLY A DOLPHIN, AND THUS A MEMBER OF THE SAME BIOLOGICAL FAMILY AS THE PORPOISE AND THE KILLER WHALE. IN COMPLETE CONTRAST TO THE VICIOUS KILLER WHALE, HOWEVER, THE WHITE WHALE IS A FRIENDLY CREATURE WHO SEEMS TO LIKE CONGENIAL COMPANY AND RHYTHMIC MOTION AND THE GOOD FUN OF SWIMMING IN FORMATION. LIKE GRAY GHOSTS COME FROM THE DEEP, THESE STRANGE CREATURES DIVE AND PIVOT AND TURN IN PERFECT UNISON. THEIR MATCHLESS PERFORMANCE BECOMES A THING OF UNEXPECTED BEAUTY, CREATING ITS OWN UNIQUE PATTERNS ON THE FACE OF THE ARCTIC SEA. IN THIS LAND OF MANY MYSTERIES, IT'S A STRANGE FACT THAT THE LARGEST LEGENDS SEEM TO COLLECT AROUND THE SMALLEST CREATURES. ONE OF THESE IS A MOUSY LITTLE RODENT CALLED THE LEMMING. HERE'S AN ACTUAL LIVING LEGEND, FOR IT'S SAID OF THIS TINY ANIMAL THAT IT COMMITS MASS SUICIDE BY RUSHING INTO THE SEA IN DROVES. THE STORY IS ONE OF THE PERSISTENT TALES OF THE ARCTIC, AND, AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN MAN'S NATURE LORE, IT'S A STORY BOTH TRUE AND FALSE, AS WE SHALL SEE IN A MOMENT. ORDINARILY, LEMMINGS ARE NOT FOUND ABOVE GROUND BEFORE THE SNOW IS GONE. BUT WINTER'S LONG PERIOD OF STARVATION MAKES THEM FINALLY TAKE UNUSUAL RISKS, AND THIS MOTHER LEMMING HAS A SPECIAL REASON FOR BEING OUT. SHE MUST FEED WELL THAT SHE MAY NURSE THE LITTER SHE'S LEFT BEHIND IN HER BURROW. FOR A CREATURE AS TINY AS THIS, EVERY SNOWDRIFT IS A MOUNTAIN RANGE AND EVERY CLUMP OF BUSHES A FOREST. IT CAN ALL GET QUITE CONFUSING. BEFORE SHE KNOWS HOW IT'S HAPPENED, THIS LITTLE WAYFARER IS THOROUGHLY LOST. SOON, SHE FINDS HERSELF WANDERING THROUGH A WEIRD WORLD OF FROZEN CHAOS. IN THIS COMPLEX MAZE OF CHAMBERED CRYSTAL, EVERY TURNING BECOMES MORE BEWILDERING. IT'S LIKE BEING LOST IN A HALL OF MIRRORS. IN A MOMENT, YOU CAN'T DECIDE WHICH IS YOU AND WHICH IS YOUR REFLECTION. SUDDENLY, SHE FINDS HERSELF LITERALLY AT SEA IN THIS WORLD OF UNREALITY AND FLOATING OFF INTO THE UNKNOWN. WHEN THE PERILOUS CRUISE ENDS LIKE THIS, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO -- SWIM FOR IT. BUT WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF ON AN ICEBERG TREADMILL AND APPARENTLY GETTING NOWHERE, IT CAN BECOME MOST DISCOURAGING. LIFE IS PERSISTENT IN THE ARCTIC, HOWEVER, OR IT WOULD NOT SURVIVE, AND THE LITTLE LEMMING DOESN'T GIVE UP THE BATTLE. SUDDENLY, A SOLUTION SUGGESTS ITSELF. IF SHE WILL JUST RIDE THE WHIRLPOOL FULL CIRCLE, IT MAY CARRY HER BACK TO THE SHORE. SO SHE DOES. AND SURE ENOUGH, IT DOES. NEAR EXHAUSTION BY NOW, SHE'D LIKE TO REST, BUT IF SHE STOPS, SHE WILL FREEZE IN HER TRACKS. BESIDES, HER FAMILY HAS ALREADY BEEN LEFT UNATTENDED FOR TOO LONG. NOW SHE SEEMS TO HAVE REDISCOVERED THE CORRECT COMPASS BEARING, AND SOON, SHE FINDS HERSELF BACK AT HER OWN FRONT DOOR. THE LEMMINGS ARE BURROWING ANIMALS AND, FROM LONG HABIT, LIVE IN AN UNDERGROUND HOME. IN THE FRIGID ZONE, HOWEVER, THIS POSES SOMETHING OF A HOUSING PROBLEM, FOR ONLY A FEW INCHES OF TOPSOIL EVER THAW OUT. THUS, THESE LITTLE RODENTS MUST LIVE, LITERALLY, AT THE GRASS ROOTS. THEY'RE A SPECIES OF MOUSE, AND LIKE MOST VARIETIES OF MICE, THEY BREED AT A REMARKABLE RATE. IN FACT, LEMMINGS WILL PRODUCE SEVERAL LITTERS WITHIN THE SHORT SPAN OF AN ARCTIC SUMMER. EVERY YEAR, THE LEMMINGS MUST COPE WITH THE PROBLEM OF THE SPRING THAW, AND EVERY YEAR FINDS THEM UNPREPARED. WHEN THE THAW COMES, AS IT ALWAYS DOES, THE ROOF LEAKS. IN THIS ONE-ROOM DUGOUT, THERE'S NO WAY TO ESCAPE THE DELUGE. THUS, A BABY LEMMING SOMETIMES HAS CAUSE TO WONDER WHETHER HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A MOUSE OR A FISH. MOTHER TAKES THE FLOOD CALMLY ENOUGH, THOUGH. AFTER ALL, IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. AND IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT IF THEY'LL ALL MOVE OUTDOORS, THEY'LL FIND THE TUNDRA CLEARED OF SNOW AT LAST. AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, THE TUNDRA COMES ALIVE WITH LEMMINGS. EACH HAS A ROVING, RAVENOUS APPETITE, AND EACH ATTACKS THE TUNDRA VEGETATION WITH A VENGEANCE, DETERMINED TO CONSUME ITS SHARE. IN A YEAR OF PEAK POPULATION, THERE'S HARDLY ROOM IN WHICH TO TURN AROUND OR SO IT SEEMS. THE SNOWSHOE RABBIT FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY THESE NOSY NEIGHBORS. EVERYWHERE HE LOOKS, THERE'S ANOTHER LEMMING. WITH ALL THIS TRAFFIC UNDERFOOT, IT WOULD SEEM A GOOD TIME FOR THE PTARMIGANS TO TAKE TO THE AIRWAYS. BUT THEY'RE RATHER LAZY BIRDS, AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO MIND HOBNOBBING WITH THESE HUNGRY HORDES. THEY LEARN TO WATCH THEIR STEP, HOWEVER, SINCE THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE A LEMMING WILL DECIDE TO FEED. FOR SOME REASON, THE GRASS ALWAYS SEEMS GREENER IN THE MOST AWKWARD PLACES. SOMETIMES IT'S A PTARMIGAN TREADING ON A LEMMING, AND SOMETIMES IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND. WELL, WITH THINGS AS CROWDED AS THIS, SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE ROOM FOR SOMEBODY SOMEHOW, AND SO NATURE HERSELF TAKES A HAND. A LEMMING MIGRATION IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. IT'S AN ACTUAL FACT THAT LEMMINGS DO MIGRATE. THEIRS IS NOT AN ANNUAL EXODUS, HOWEVER. IT HAPPENS ONLY PERIODICALLY, ABOUT EVERY 7 TO 10 YEARS DURING THE PEAK OF THEIR POPULATION CYCLE. A TIME OF TREMENDOUS REPRODUCTION GENERALLY MEANS A TIME OF FAMINE. THE LEMMINGS QUITE LITERALLY EAT THEMSELVES OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME. WHENEVER THIS HAPPENS, THEY FIND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE TO A NEW FEEDING GROUND. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT LEMMINGS ARE A LOT LIKE SHEEP -- THAT ONE OR TWO START TO GO SOMEWHERE, AND THE REST ARE DETERMINED TO GO, TOO. ONCE IN MOTION, NONE STOPS TO ASK WHY. INSTEAD, A KIND OF COMPULSION SEIZES EACH TINY RODENT, AND CARRIED ALONG BY AN UNREASONING HYSTERIA, EACH FALLS INTO STEP FOR A MARCH THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO A STRANGE DESTINY. ONCE THEY BEGIN TO MOVE IN FORMATION, THEY PRESENT THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES WITH AN UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY, AND ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY, PREDATORS SEEM TO COME FROM EVERYWHERE. THE JAEGER BIRD, FOR ONE, LITERALLY LIES IN WAIT IN MIDAIR, KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE PROCESSION BELOW. AT LAST, WITHOUT WARNING, HE SWOOPS. IN THE FACE OF DEATH, EVEN A CREATURE AS SMALL AS A MOUSE WILL PUT UP A DESPERATE BATTLE. BUT THIS TIME, COURAGE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. AS BIRDS OF PREY, IN FACT, THE JAEGERS RIVAL THE ARCTIC OWL. THE RAVEN IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNIST WHO TRIES HIS HAND AT THIS FASCINATING GAME. IT'S SOON APPARENT, HOWEVER, THAT HE'S NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AT IT AS THE JAEGER BIRD. GENERALLY, IT'S THE RAVEN'S WAY TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO THIS SORT OF THING. HE'S A SCAVENGER BY INCLINATION, AND THUS, WHEN HE HAS TO COPE WITH A LITTLE FAST FOOTWORK, HE'S APT TO END UP LOOKING FOOLISH AND STILL HUNGRY. AMONG THE ARCTIC HUNTERS, THE ONE WHO MIGHT BE CALLED "OLD NEVER MISS," IS THE ERMINE, NOW APPEARING IN HIS SUMMERTIME COAT. A MEMBER OF THE WEASEL TRIBE, THE ERMINE INHERITS THE BLOODTHIRSTY TEMPERAMENT OF HIS SPECIES. WHEN HE FINALLY DECIDES TO STRIKE, IT'S IN DEADLY EARNEST. BY NATURAL LAW, THE PREDATORS TAKE THEIR TOLL, YET, IN SPITE OF THEM, THE MIGRATION GOES ON. BY NOW, THE LEMMINGS HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF FOOD. THEY'VE BECOME VICTIMS OF AN OBSESSION. A ONE-TRACK THOUGHT -- MOVE ON, MOVE ON, KEEP MOVING ON. IF THEY COME TO A TINY STREAM, THEY PLUNGE RIGHT IN. WATER DOESN'T FAZE THEM. INDEED, THEY'LL SWIM SIZEABLE RIVERS AND EVEN LAKES IN THEIR DETERMINATION TO PUSH ON. AHEAD LIES THE ARCTIC SHORE AND BEYOND, THE SEA, AND STILL THE LITTLE ANIMALS SURGE FORWARD. THEIR FRENZY TAKES THEM TUMBLING DOWN THE TERRACED CLIFFS, CREATING TINY AVALANCHES OF SLIDING SOIL AND ROCKS AND SEEMINGLY INDESTRUCTIBLE LEMMINGS. THEY REACH THE FINAL PRECIPICE. THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO TURN BACK. YET OVER THEY GO, CASTING THEMSELVES BODILY OUT INTO SPACE. ALL SEEM TO SURVIVE THE ORDEAL, FOR NOW, THEY BEGIN TO SWIM -- NOT TOWARD LAND, STRANGELY, BUT AWAY FROM SHORE, TOWARD THE FAR HORIZON. OTHERS FIND THE BEACHES BY ROUNDABOUT WAYS, AND THEY, TOO, PLUNGE INTO THE WAVES. IT'S NOT GIVEN TO MAN TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF NATURE'S MYSTERIES. BUT AS NEARLY AS HE CAN SURMISE, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LEMMINGS CONSIDER THIS BODY OF WATER JUST ANOTHER LAKE. AND IF IT'S A LAKE, THEN IT MUST HAVE A FARTHER SHORE, AND SO THEY STRIKE OUT BOLDLY. BUT GRADUALLY, STRENGTH WANES. DETERMINATION EBBS AWAY. AND SOON, THE ARCTIC SEA IS DOTTED WITH TINY BOBBING BODIES. AND SO IS ACTED OUT THE LEGEND OF MASS SUICIDE, AND DESTRUCTION OF A SPECIES IT WOULD SEEM TO BE, EXCEPT THAT NATURE, IN HER INFINITE WISDOM, HAS SPARED A FEW. BACK ON THE ARCTIC PLAIN, THERE REMAINS THE SMALL HANDFUL THAT DID NOT MAKE THIS FATAL JOURNEY. AND IN TIME, NEW GENERATIONS WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN LOST. AND YET, WHEN THE POPULATION CYCLE MOUNTS TO ANOTHER PEAK, THE LEMMING LEGEND WILL BE TOLD AGAIN AND WILL COME TO THIS SAME AMAZING CLIMAX -- A FINAL RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY AND WITH DEATH. WITH THE SPRING THAW, LAKES AND LAGOONS BY THE THOUSANDS DOT THE LANDSCAPE, AND THESE BECOME THE PERFECT HAVEN FOR VISITING WATERFOWL. EVERY YEAR, THEY COME -- THE FLOCKS UNCOUNTED, SPECIES WITHOUT NUMBER, TEMPORARY RESIDENTS IN THIS EMPTY LAND. HERE THEY FIND PEACE. HERE THEY CAN RAISE THEIR YOUNG UNDISTURBED BY CIVILIZATION. BUT WHILE THE FEMALES TEND THE NESTS, THE MALES, GENERALLY, ARE TO BE FOUND SHOWING OFF THEIR FINE FEATHERS. AND IN THIS DEPARTMENT, NONE CAN MATCH THE KING EIDER DUCK. HE IS INDEED NATURE'S DANDY -- SARTORIAL SPLENDOR PERSONIFIED. FOR EVERY NEW FAMILY, THERE'S FOOD TO BE FOUND, OF COURSE, AND THIS LITTLE WADING BIRD GOES ABOUT THE JOB IN A MOST UNUSUAL WAY. IT TURNS OVER THE STONES ALONG THE SHORE, AND SO IT'S CALLED -- WELL, WHAT ELSE BUT THE TURNSTONE. THESE ARE THE PHALAROPES, AND THEY, TOO, HAVE A METHOD OF GETTING FOOD THAT'S UNIQUE. FIRST, THEY SWIM IN A TIGHT CIRCLE TO CREATE A SMALL WHIRLPOOL. THEN THEY LET ITS NATURAL SUCTION BRING UP FROM THE BOTTOM THE EDIBLES THEY'RE SEEKING. AS A NESTING GROUND, THE TUNDRA IS NOT WITHOUT ITS DRAWBACKS. THERE ISN'T A TREE WITHIN MILES, AND SO ALL NESTS MUST BE LAID FLAT ON THE EARTH. THIS, OF COURSE, MAKES THEM ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY PREDATOR WHO COMES ALONG, AND DURING THE INCUBATION PERIOD, BIRDS LIKE THIS ARCTIC GULL PRACTICALLY NEVER KNOW A MOMENT'S SLEEP. SOMETIMES THE POLAR BEARS DECIDE TO RAID THIS SANCTUARY. BUT WHEN THEY DO, IT GENERALLY MEANS REAL TROUBLE. HERE THE BEAR HAS ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING A LOON. IT'D GLADLY SIT DOWN TO ENJOY THE PEACE AND QUIET OF A SIMPLE MEAL, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN HOLD OF MORE FUSS AND FEATHERS THAN HE BARGAINED FOR. IF HE'S NOT CAREFUL, HE MAY LOSE AN EYE, FOR THE BIRD'S SHARP BILL CAN BE A VICIOUS WEAPON AT CLOSE QUARTERS. IN FACT, IF THIS KEEPS UP MUCH LONGER, HE MAY LOSE BOTH EYES. AT LAST, THE BEAR DECIDES HE'D RATHER EAT CROW, AND HE RELEASES HIS CATCH. FROM NOW ON, HE'LL TAKE HIS BIRDS LIKE THIS -- AS EGGS, NOT NEARLY THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE NERVES. HERE'S ANOTHER EGG SNATCHER WHO HAS TO BE WATCHED EVERY MINUTE. LEAVE A NEST UNATTENDED, AND THE ERMINE IS SURE TO TURN UP. THE BIGGER THE EGG, THE BIGGER THE MEAL, HE FIGURES, WITHOUT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO THE INCIDENTAL MATTER OF CRACKING IT. BUT IN A MOMENT, THE PROBLEM BEGINS TO COME INTO FOCUS -- HOW TO GET ROUND OBJECT INTO SQUARE CORNER IN ORDER THAT ANGLE OF BITE MAY ENCOMPASS MORE OF CIRCUMFERENCE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AT LAST, HE FINDS A PLACE WHERE HE CAN PIN IT DOWN AND APPLY SOME LEVERAGE. NOW TO THE FEAST. SOUTHWARD FROM THE TUNDRA, IN THE FORESTS THAT BOUND THE ARCTIC WASTELAND, THERE LIVES YET ANOTHER LEGEND OF THE NORTH, A STRANGE DUCK THAT NESTS IN HOLLOW TREES. THIS IS THE GOLDENEYE, A DUCK THAT VIOLATES ALL THE USUAL RULES FOR POND-LOVING WATERFOWL. NO NEST AMONG THE REEDS FOR HER. SHE CHOOSES TO LIVE IN THE ABANDONED QUARTERS OF THE WOODPECKERS, AND HERE SHE HATCHES OUT HER BROOD OF DOWNY DUCKLINGS. NOW, IT HAPPENS THAT THESE BABIES MUST LEAVE THE NEST BEFORE THEY'VE LEARNED TO FLY. THUS, MOTHER'S PROBLEM IS HOW TO GET THEM SAFELY DOWN FROM THEIR PENTHOUSE APARTMENT. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND HERSELF AND GIVES A MATERNAL CALL. IN RESPONSE, THE YOUNGSTERS CLIMB UP THE INSIDE OF THE TREE TO THE OPENING. NATURE, IT SEEMS, HAS GIVEN THEM TINY SPURS FOR THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY. BUT BEYOND HERE, THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN. WELL, TALLYHO. LOOK OUT BELOW. NATURE'S SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM IN AERODYNAMICS IS BOTH SIMPLE AND UNORTHODOX. LACKING WINGS FOR THINGS, YOU ADD MORE BOUNCE TO THE OUNCE. LAST TO GO IS TAIL-END CHARLIE, MASTER OF THE TIMID TAKEOFF. THERE'S ALWAYS ONE IN EVERY SQUADRON. MY, THAT'S A LONG WAY DOWN. FINALLY, THE ENTIRE BROOD IS ON THE GROUND, ALL ACCOUNTED FOR AND ALL IN ONE PIECE, AMAZING AS THAT MAY SEEM. THEIR TROUBLES AREN'T OVER, HOWEVER, FOR, STRANGELY, THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE MANEUVER. SINCE THEY CAN'T FLY, HAVING JUST PROVED THAT BEYOND DOUBT, THEY'RE VULNERABLE TO ANY NUMBER OF PREDATORS. AND IT BEHOOVES THEM TO MAKE A BEELINE FOR THE NEAREST POND, AND SO, OFF THEY GO ON THE DOUBLE. BESIDES BEING A NESTING PLACE FOR THE BIRDS, THE LIMITLESS TUNDRA IS ALSO A NATURAL PASTURE FOR THE ARCTIC GRASS EATERS. AND AMONG THESE, NONE IS MORE ARCTIC THAN THE MUSK-OX. HERE AGAIN IS A SPECIES THAT'S A LIVING LEGEND. IN FACT, THIS IS THE ONE ANIMAL THAT HAS ACTUALLY SURVIVED FROM THE ICE AGE. HE LOOKS TODAY, IN REALITY, EXACTLY AS HE DOES IN THE CAVEMAN'S PAINTINGS OF LONG AGO. THE MUSK-OX HAS ENDURED THE HARSH CENTURIES OF ARCTIC CLIMATE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE PROTECTIVE COAT OF LONG HAIR HE DEVELOPED IN THE BEGINNING. ALMOST TOUCHING THE GROUND, THIS GENEROUS BLANKET HAS MEANT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND EXTINCTION. AMONG THE OXEN OF THE WORLD, THE MUSK-OX IS RATHER A SMALL BREED. HE STANDS ONLY 4 FEET HIGH AT THE SHOULDERS AND WEIGHS ABOUT 600 POUNDS. BUT HE'S STOCKY AND STRONG, AND HE'S EQUIPPED WITH A FORMIDABLE PAIR OF HORNS FOR SELF-DEFENSE. LET A WANDERING WOLF APPEAR ON THE HORIZON, AND THE BULLS ARE IMMEDIATELY ON THE ALERT. HERD ANIMALS BY HABIT, THE MUSK-OXEN REACT TO DANGER BY A PREARRANGED PLAN. ALL RUSH TO A CENTRAL RALLYING PLACE. HERE, THEY GROUP THEMSELVES IN A DEFENSIVE CIRCLE -- COWS AND CALVES IN THE CENTER, BULLS ALONG THE OUTER EDGE -- ALL HORNS POINTING OUTWARD. FROM PAST EXPERIENCE, THE WOLF HAS LEARNED THAT THIS IS AN UNASSAILABLE POSITION, AND SO HE PASSES ON BY, PRETENDING DISINTEREST. WHEN THE WOLF IS GONE, THE HERD WILL OFTEN RETIRE TO ANOTHER DEFENSE -- THESE CASTLE-LIKE FORMATIONS THAT DOT THE FAR-REACHING TUNDRA. HERE, ALL TRAILS LEAD UPWARD TO A KIND OF NATURAL FORTRESS AND SAFETY. OF ALL OF NATURE'S NEAR-LEGENDARY ANIMALS, THE WOLF IS THE ONE AROUND WHOM THE MOST FOLKLORE SEEMS TO CLING. IN FAIRY TALES THE WORLD OVER, HE'S INVARIABLY MADE OUT THE VILLAIN AND SYMBOL OF ALL THINGS WICKED. HE IS A PREDATOR, TO BE SURE, BUT ONE WHO SERVES A USEFUL PURPOSE IN NATURE'S SCHEME OF THINGS. AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIS LEGEND, HE'S SURPRISINGLY WELL-BEHAVED. IT'S ONLY IN THE REMOTE REFUGE OF THIS ARCTIC WASTELAND THAT WOLVES CAN RAISE THEIR FAMILIES IN PEACE, FOR THIS MUCH-MALIGNED SPECIES HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF GREAT AREAS OF THE GLOBE. THE PROGENITOR OF THE DOG CLAN, THE WOLF POSSESSES MANY OF THE CANINE VIRTUES, AMONG THEM, LOYALTY TO HIS KIND. WOLVES MATE FOR LIFE, AND THE MALE IS AN UNUSUALLY GOOD PROVIDER. OFTEN, HE'LL RETURN FROM A HUNT TO DISGORGE PART OF HIS KILL. IN THIS WAY, THE PUPS ARE WEANED ON FOOD ALREADY PREDIGESTED. AS A PARENT, THE MALE IS SURPRISINGLY PATIENT WITH HIS YOUNGSTERS AND WILLINGLY SUBMITS TO THE PLAYFUL MAULING THAT FATHERS ARE EXPECTED TO UNDERGO. WHEN DISCIPLINE IS CALLED FOR, IT'S A MERE NIP WITH HIS STEEL-TRAP JAWS. THESE ARE THE JAWS THAT CAN BRING DOWN FULL-GROWN REINDEER AND CARIBOU. YET, FOR THE MOMENT, THEIR CRUSHING POWER IS HELD IN CHECK. SOON, THE SCHOOLING OF THESE YOUNGSTERS MUST BEGIN, AND THE FIRST SUBJECT IS MUSIC. EVERY WOLF PUP THAT ASPIRES TO HIS FULL CREDENTIALS MUST, OF COURSE, LEARN TO HOWL AT THE MOON. NEXT COME THE LESSONS IN HUNTING. IN THESE WIDE OPEN SPACES, IT'S NOT EXACTLY EASY TO FIND A MEAL, AND THE ART OF TRACKING AND TRAILING MUST BE CONSTANTLY PRACTICED. WORKING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY, THE YOUNGSTERS GET USED TO THE FEEL OF THE GROUP AND THUS ARE TRAINED TOWARD THE TIME WHEN THEY WILL HUNT WITH THE PACK. FROM CENTURIES OF EXPERIENCE, THE WOLVES HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE IS ONE HUNTING TERRITORY WHERE SUCCESS IS PRACTICALLY GUARANTEED, AND THIS IS AT THE ENTRANCES TO THE MOUNTAIN PASSES. THROUGH THESE GATEWAYS MUST PASS THE GREAT CARIBOU HERDS ON THEIR WAY TO THE TUNDRA GRAZING GROUNDS. AND SO THE PACK SETS UP A SYSTEM OF SENTRIES, CONSTANTLY ON WATCH FROM THESE RAMPARTS. SURE ENOUGH, WITHOUT FAIL, THE LEAD BULLS APPEAR, SIGNALING THE APPROACH OF THE CARIBOU VANGUARD. THE CARIBOU AND THEIR CLOSE COUSIN THE REINDEER ARE THE ARCTIC MEMBERS OF THE DEER FAMILY AND THUS ARE THE NATURAL PREY OF THE WOLVES. EACH SUMMER, THESE TREMENDOUS HERDS MIGRATE NORTHWARD BOUND FOR THEIR HABITUAL GRAZING GROUND ON THE OPEN TUNDRA. THIS ANNUAL TREK IS A FLOWING TIDE OF ANIMALS THAT MOVES TOWARD THE POLE JUST AS SURELY AS THE RIVERS THAT SEEK THE ARCTIC SEA. SOMETIMES, THE TWO CURRENTS CROSS AT FORDING PLACES ALONG THE BOTTOMLANDS. AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, THESE FLOOD-SWOLLEN STREAMS ARE SWIFT AND TREACHEROUS. YET EVEN THE NEWBORN FAWNS MUST MAKE THE CROSSING OR BE LEFT BEHIND. NOTHING CAN BE ALLOWED TO HALT THE HERD'S PROGRESS. AS THE CARIBOU COME WITHIN RANGE, THE WOLVES MOVE DOWN TO THE VALLEY FLOOR. THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS CROWD THE HERDS INTO A SINGLE NARROW PASSAGEWAY -- TERRAIN THAT IS DECIDEDLY TO THE WOLVES' ADVANTAGE. THEY TAKE THEIR STATIONS WITH AN ALMOST CASUAL AIR. TODAY THE CARIBOU MUST RUN THE GAUNTLET, AND TODAY, FOR SURE, THE WOLVES WILL KNOW A TIME OF ABUNDANCE. THE CHASE BEGINS. THE WOLVES RUN THE HERD IN RELAYS, SPELLING EACH OTHER FROM TIME TO TIME. AS THE WOLVES KNEW IT WOULD, FATIGUE BEGINS TO TELL, AND SOON, THE LAGGARDS FIND THEMSELVES OVERTAKEN AND DRAGGED DOWN. AND SO BEGINS A SUCCESSION OF KILLS. THIS IS NATURE'S WAY OF CULLING OUT THE HERD. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE PREDATORS PULL DOWN THE CRIPPLES AND THE WEAKLINGS, AND ONE BY ONE, THE UNFIT COME TO THE END OF THE TRAIL. IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ANIMAL COULD DRIVE THE WOLF FROM HIS HARD-EARNED DINNER, AND YET THERE IS ONE THAT CAN, AND DOES, DO JUST THAT. HE'S A MEMBER OF THE WEASEL TRIBE CALLED THE WOLVERINE. TRUE TO THE BLOODTHIRSTY TRADITION OF HIS KIND, HE CAN LICK HIS WEIGHT IN WOLVES, WILDCATS, OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT COME ALONG. THE WOLVERINE IS A CREATURE WHOSE WAYS ARE CLOAKED IN MYSTERY. AND THIS CAMERA RECORD IS PERHAPS THE FIRST TO REVEAL HIS HABITS IN DETAIL. AS WE WATCH HIM MAKE HIS ROUNDS, WE SHALL COME TO KNOW AN ANIMAL WHO EVEN OUTDOES THE TALL TALES TOLD ABOUT HIM, AND THESE ARE LEGION -- TALES OF HIS STRENGTH, HIS CUNNING, HIS FEROCITY, AND HIS APPETITE. IN THE WOLVERINE, FACT DOES INDEED SURPASS FICTION. THE WOLVERINE IS RATHER A SURLY CHARACTER AND, BY CUSTOM, A SOLITARY TRAVELER. HE NOT ONLY DOESN'T LIKE COMPANY, IT APPEARS HE CAN'T STAND IT, EVEN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN KIND. WHEN AROUSED, HE NOT ONLY SOUNDS DANGEROUS... ...BUT MANAGES TO LOOK DANGEROUS, TOO. THE TRUTH IS HE'S EXACTLY WHAT HE APPEARS TO BE -- A DEMON AS A FIGHTER, READY AND WILLING TO TAKE ON ALL COMERS. HE WEIGHS ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT 30 POUNDS, YET HE CAN EASILY HANDLE FIVE TIMES HIS OWN WEIGHT IN ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE COMBAT. THE WOLVERINE IS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE. HE HAS AMAZING ENDURANCE AND CAN COVER A LOT OF GROUND WITH HIS TIRELESS LOPE. HE AND HIS KIND WANDER ALL OVER THE ARCTIC, FROM THE SOUTHERN FORESTS TO THE NORTHERN SHORELINE. AND IT'S HIS HABIT TO COVER THE SAME HUNTING TERRITORY IN A SORT OF GREAT CIRCLE TOUR. SINCE HE'S AN ACCOMPLISHED CLIMBER, HE CHECKS EVERY TREETOP LOOKOUT TO SEE JUST WHAT MIGHT BE STIRRING IN HIS TERRITORY. THERE'S A LOT OF THE BEAR IN THE WOLVERINE AS WELL AS THE RACCOON, WHOM HE RESEMBLES IN THE USE OF HIS PAWS. IN FACT, HE SEEMS TO BE A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL ANIMALS. WHEREVER HE SPIES ACTIVITY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND, IT MEANS FOOD, FOR IF IT'S ALIVE, HE'LL EAT IT. HIS VORACIOUS APPETITE KNOWS NO SATISFYING. HE'S QUITE LITERALLY HUNGER ON THE PROWL. IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES, IN FACT, THIS ANIMAL IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS "THE GLUTTON." HIS PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH COMES INTO PLAY WHEN HE FINDS SOMETHING TEMPTING HIDDEN UNDERNEATH A ROCK. HE NEVER STOPS TO CONSIDER THE WEIGHT OF A BOULDER. HE SIMPLY MOVES IT OUT OF HIS WAY. FOR THE REWARD OF A TINY GRUB OR TWO, HE'LL EXERT ENOUGH ENERGY TO DISLODGE AN ENTIRE QUARRY. IN MAN'S BOOK OF BACKWOODS LORE, THERE'S A STORY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE WOLVERINE CAN EAT A WHOLE MOOSE IN ONE SITTING. IT'S AN OLD STORY LONG ACCEPTED AS TRUTH, AND IT PAYS TRIBUTE TO THIS ANIMAL'S AMBITION EVEN IF IT OVERESTIMATES HIS CAPACITY. YET, THE LEGEND DOES HAVE A CERTAIN FACTUAL BASIS, FOR IT IS TRUE THAT THE WOLVERINE WILL CONTINUE FEEDING ON A LARGE CARCASS FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL HE'S DISPOSED OF IT. HE'S NOT ONE TO LET FOOD GO TO WASTE, MOUSE OR MOOSE, UNLESS SOMETHING BETTER TURNS UP. OCCASIONALLY, THAT SOMETHING IS THE SNOWSHOE RABBIT. ONCE HE'S ON A RABBIT'S TRAIL, THE WOLVERINE IS HARD TO SHAKE, FOR AMONG ALL HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS, HE CAN COUNT SPEED, TOO. THIS BECOMES A PLACE OF SAFETY ONLY IF IT'S TOO SMALL FOR THE WOLVERINE TO ENTER. AT THE SAME TIME, IT MUST BE TOO STRONG FOR HIM TO TEAR APART, AND AS A LAST SAFETY REQUIREMENT, THE RABBIT MUST BE ABLE TO HIDE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE WOLVERINE'S SHARP CLAWS. THIS IS A CASE OF ESCAPING THE CLAWS OF DEATH BY A RATHER NARROW MARGIN. BUT FOR THE MOMENT, THE RABBIT SEEMS SAFE. AT LEAST HE THOUGHT HE WAS, UNTIL HE GETS THE STRANGE FEELING THAT ALL IS NOT QUITE AS IT SHOULD BE. FOR SOME REASON, THE POOR RABBIT CLAN SEEMS TO ATTRACT PERSECUTION. AND IF IT ISN'T THE WOLVERINE MAKING LIFE UNBEARABLE, IT'S THAT PESKY RAVEN, STILL POKING HIS SHARP NOSE INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS. ABOUT THE TIME IT BEGINS TO LOOK AS THOUGH THIS MIGHT GO ON FOREVER, THE WOLVERINE REAPPEARS. AT FIRST, HE DOESN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THESE GOINGS-ON. WHO WANTS TO CATCH A RAVEN? HE WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF A PRIZE, ANYWAY. STILL, IF THIS CLOWN IS GOING TO HANG AROUND AND TRY TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF HIM, WELL, THERE'S HIS PRIDE TO THINK OF, TO SAY NOTHING OF HIS REPUTATION. MAYBE HE'D BETTER TEND TO HIM ONCE AND FOR ALL. OOPS! IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE RAVEN FOOLED HIM THAT TIME, BUT TO PROVE THAT HE WAS ONTO THE TRICK ALL ALONG, THE WOLVERINE PROCEEDS TO PLAY A GAME OF HIS OWN WITH THIS IMPROVISED TEETER-TOTTER. WITH THE RAVEN GONE, THE WOLVERINE CAN NOW GET BACK TO THE SERIOUS BUSINESS OF MAKING A LIVING. SUDDENLY, DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, HE SPIES A MOST-INTRIGUING NEST, AND IF HE'S NOT MISTAKEN, THERE SHOULD BE A FLEDGING OSPREY IN RESIDENCE HERE ABOUT THIS TIME OF YEAR. AT THE SIGHT OF THE WOLVERINE BELOW, THE MOTHER BIRD GROWS ALARMED AND LEAVES THE NEST. BUT SURE ENOUGH, HERE'S THE BABY -- FULLY FEATHERED, YET STILL UNABLE TO FLY. A MEMBER OF THE HAWK FAMILY, THE OSPREY HAS THE MURDEROUS TALONS OF THE BIRDS OF PREY, AND SHE'S ALWAYS READY TO USE THEM. BUT THE WOLVERINE DOESN'T GIVE THIS A SECOND THOUGHT. HE'S UP THE TREE IN AN INSTANT. THE MOTHER BIRD RECOGNIZES HIS INTENTIONS IMMEDIATELY AND BEGINS DEFENSIVE TACTICS. USING A DESPERATE DIVE-BOMBING ATTACK, SHE TRIES TO KNOCK HIM OUT OF THE TREE, OR, FAILING IN THAT, TO DRIVE HIM BACK TO THE GROUND. MEANWHILE, THE YOUNG BIRD WATCHES ALL THIS WITH GROWING APPREHENSION, AND IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MOTHER CAN DO, IT FINDS ITSELF STARING DEATH IN THE FACE. AND SO TRAGEDY STRIKES. AND SO A GRIEVING MOTHER IS LEFT TO MOURN AN EMPTY NEST. IN THE ARCTIC, THE FROSTY BREATH OF THE COLD SEASON COMES SUDDENLY, AND WHEN IT DOES, ALL THE INHABITANTS INSTANTLY KNOW ITS MEANING. WINTER IS ABOUT TO RECLAIM ITS KINGDOM. TO SOME OF THESE ARCTIC RESIDENTS, THIS ICE AGE SETTING REMAINS A PERMANENT HOME, AND THE COMING OF WINTER MAKES LITTLE CHANGE IN THEIR NORMAL ROUTINE. THE POLAR BEAR PATROLS HIS BEAT AS USUAL, UNMINDFUL OF THE COLD. WINTER AND SUMMER, HE REMAINS WHAT NATURE INTENDED HIM TO BE -- LORD AND SOVEREIGN OF THIS FROZEN DOMAIN. HIS CUBS INHERIT ALL HIS HEARTY ENDURANCE AND, WITH IT, A LOFTY DISDAIN FOR THE COLD. ONLY A POLAR BEAR, IT SEEMS, COULD MAKE A PLAYTHING OF AN ICEBERG. AND SNOWBALLS, IT WOULD APPEAR, ARE AS MUCH FUN AS EVER. THE WALRUS IS ANOTHER OF THE ARCTIC'S YEAR-ROUND RESIDENTS. THE WHITE WHALES, TOO, WILL REMAIN IN THE POLAR SEA, CONTINUING THEIR FORMATION SWIMMING FOR AS LONG AS THERE'S OPEN WATER IN WHICH TO PERFORM. BUT FOR SOME, WINTER ON THE EXPOSED ARCTIC SHORE IS TOO MUCH, AND THEY MUST RETREAT TO WARMER REGIONS. THE CARIBOU AND THE REINDEER MUST LEAVE THE OPEN TUNDRA AND SEEK THE SHELTER OF THE DEEP FORESTS FARTHER SOUTH. BUT THIS LATE IN THE SEASON, THEY FIND A NEW HAZARD AT THE RIVER CROSSINGS. AND THEIR OLD ENEMIES ARE IN FOR A SURPRISE, TOO. IT SEEMS THAT SOME NEW RULES OF THE CHASE ARE IN EFFECT. FOR BOTH HUNTER AND HUNTED, IT'S A TIME TO MAKE HASTE SLOWLY, YET IT'S A TIME FOR SPEED, TOO, FOR THERE'S ALWAYS THE GRIM POSSIBILITY THAT THE ARCTIC BLIZZARDS MAY COME TOO SOON AND TRAP THEM IN THESE RUGGED MOUNTAIN PASSES. AND SO THE GREAT HERDS PLOD ON, STOPPING NEITHER FOR FOOD NOR DRINK. AT LAST, THE SUMMIT IS ACHIEVED, THE FARTHER SLOPES REACHED. AND NOW THE DESPERATE ANIMALS, SENSING THEIR VICTORY, RACE FOR THE SHELTERING TREES. ONCE AGAIN, THEY'RE SAFELY RETURNED TO THEIR ANCESTRAL FORESTS. AND NONE TOO SOON, FOR NOW THE BLIZZARD COMES. NOW WINTER TAKES BACK ITS ARCTIC DOMAIN. THE BITTER COLD OF THE ICE AGE RETURNS TO THIS FROZEN LAND. TIME AND ETERNITY ONCE MORE BECOME ONE. AND THE LONG BLACK SHADOW OF THE ARCTIC NIGHTS STEALS ACROSS THE HIGHEST PEAKS. AND YET, LIFE WILL NOT VANISH WITH THE FADING LIGHT BUT, WITH THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS, WILL COME AGAIN. POLAR BEAR AND WALRUS, MUSK-OX AND WOLF, WOLVERINE AND LEMMING, CARIBOU AND REINDEER -- ALL IN TIME WILL REAPPEAR TO RE-CREATE THEIR STRANGE PATTERNS OF SURVIVAL ON THE DESOLATE REACHES OF NATURE'S WHITE WILDERNESS.
