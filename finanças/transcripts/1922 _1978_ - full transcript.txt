The Greek Film Centre presents... A Film by Nikos Koundouros. Based on the book "Number 31328" by Elias Venezis. Written by Nikos Koundouros and Stratis Karras. August 15, 1922 Greece, you are crowned once again with Glory eternal... Once more the canons of your sailors are echoing on the sea. Greece, your children are forever covered with immortal glory. Alexander the Great's gaze protects your every step. Look at the peoples of the world, who support your noble cause. The English, French and Italians protect the Parthenon! O Greece, unique land. Mother of heroes. It is my honour and pride to be killed for you! O Greece, unique land, fearless state,... Glory herself awaits to crown your children. For the death for you is a sweet death indeed. He who dies today will never has to die! I fancy this, and I fancy that too! I fancy them both, and will keep them. I fancy this, and I fancy that too! I fancy this, and I fancy that too! I fancy them both, and I won't give them to you. I like my sweet and I will not give it to you! Keep your mouth shut or else we will get in trouble. They say that our allies, the Italians, are planning to support the Turks. Do you believe they will pull a fast one on us? Don't be afraid, brother. This is complete gibberish. I myself heard... Don't say a word to anyone, otherwise we're screwed, okay? Our French Allies are selling guns to Kemal! I fancy this, and I fancy that too! I fancy them both and I won't give them to you. Did you see him? Down in the stalls! On the second line. Don't say a word. The army is leaving. The streets are full of vagrants staring at you. Everybody sees it except you! I'm a woman, and I feel it. Right now... There are 15,000 Greek soldiers in Smyrna. Allied warships anchored in the port. British ships, Italian ships, french ships. And you are scared of three vagrants on the corner. We're going to buy tickets tomorrow. The conversation is over. This city is driving me crazy. All eyes were on you in the theater. Italians only look at women. They never do more than that. So they are used to. If we stay, we will go to their reception on Saturday. We will be gone since Saturday. All the people we know will be there. Captain Ferro, Bertini... Amalia's brother who works at the French Embassy,... Italian captains,... and this secretary of the British Embasy who makes advances to you. They say that they rape women and kill them afterwards. Who are "They"? If the Army leaves, the city is lost! The Turks will spare no one. Alekos came to say goodbye. Leave him alone. Have a nice trip, my child. Have a nice trip. Farewell, my child. Listen... This is not a transfer. This is a retreat! You're right! And they didn't say a word to us! They know what they're doing. What about all these people? There are 4 million Greeks in Anatolia. We were born here. We will die here. Anatolia is Greek! It is our homeland! I was born here! My father was born here and my grandfather as well! And my grandfather as well! {\pos(200,250)} [Italian]We are ready... four persons. You,... the lady ... two children Yes, you! You must bring a certificate from the Italian Embassy. I'm sorry but without a certificate nothing can be done! And you, Mr Chavras! You have registered a family of 9 people... but here it is written fourteen! Please don't push! You will break the door glass! And you, Madam! Your passport is not valid! What do you want from me? I am an agency employe. Ι am not the government! - Ask the State for help! - What State are you talking about? Where is the State now? They took their documents and ran away! That's right! They ran away! Greeks, we have been betrayed! The army is withdrawing and they don't say a word! Here it is! "The Turks will never reach Smyrna!" The Turks are coming! They're outside the city, while we are being fooled! There is no Greek State in Smyrna anymore. And... what about us? What are we gonna do? What will happen to us? We will wait for the Turks... unarmed... like sheep to the slaughter. I have a name here, Marcagini! Antonio Marcagini! Marcagini, two people! Marcagini! Antonio Marcagini, two people. Marcagini! You have to find a fake certificate! Now! WEDNESDAY AUGUST 24, 1922 - What can we do now? - We should have left a long time ago! - So many caught up and left. - Bullshit, how many left? We are always among the last! Why didn't we leave like the others? - You insisted not to follow the mass. - Yes, but this time is different. Of course, it is not! The man at the travel agency said that he will leave today. - Do not be afraid! - I'm fine! Loukia! Loukia! What is our fault? What is MY fault? Nobody asked me! Come on say it!

Calm down, calm down now... Forgive us, my child! Two men killed in one's family is too many. Open it at page 43. You must forgive me! {\pos(195,242)}And dogs, wolves and birds of prey... {\pos(195,242)}And dogs, wolves and birds of prey... {\pos(195,242)}Will tear your flesh apart... {\pos(195,242)}and will put your bodies out of the ground. {\pos(195,242)}And we will laugh out loud without the slightest remorse. {\pos(195,242)}Widows, orphans... {\pos(195,242)}Children without a home or a future,... {\pos(195,242)}for as much as the iron perfomed it's duty nicely... {\pos(195,242)}And the dead are dead for good.

The events, known as the Greek Genocide, were part of the... systematic killing of the Christian Ottoman population. To this day, Turkey refuses to admit those crimes,... even though turkish politicians refer to them frequently with pride. Subtitles: Vlassis Mantziokas
