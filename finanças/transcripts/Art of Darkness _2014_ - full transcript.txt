[eerie music] - I can say, I can sit here, and say right now, I got a calling to do self portraits everyday for the rest of my life until I die. But that's not necessarily being honest because there's some thought involved with that. It didn't take a supernatural being or some magical thing to happen; it was just a decision I made, a logical, rational decision I made. And then all this other stuff, everything else, just all this bloomed out of that. [eerie music] There might be some desperation there, where you feel desperate, like you're alone. Maybe for me personally, I'm like, "Oh, I'm alone in the world," or something, or maybe I thought no one understood me. You know, whatever type of negatives... Part of me, with the self-portraits, wants to get as much experience out of life as possible so that by the time that I die I will have really lived a full life. I really don't like it when people say that, "I was chosen," or "Painting's my calling, "I can't imagine without it," or something like that because it tries to make it a mysterious type of thing. So, like, someone with some depression or low self esteem and beats them self up or someone that's a little bit psychotic, maybe even have a whole bunch of psychotic in them. It just creates all this baggage that they don't need when they just want to... They just need a little bit of encouragement and self worth. Sometimes I'm easily excitable so I can get really outrageous. I get on the bullhorn and yell at people on the streets and just act up and stuff. I don't get depressed too much more of some mania, but not really too bad where it can't be kept in check. Ever since I got in that knife fight and went to prison, I always knew, "Don't carry a knife." If you don't have a knife in your pocket you can never use it, you can never stab someone, ever, if you don't have a knife. I never stabbed anyone after that. But then, I did cut... I was just so much of a trouble maker then and doing so many terrible things that I didn't really get to stay with it... I always liked art, and stuff, but it wasn't until I went to East Tennessee State University that I really saw that I could use it to help me psychologically and emotionally and socially. [deep piano music] I don't have a lot of joy. Doing the self portraits I get some joy from because I know that no matter whatever happens to me, unless I'm in a coma, or have a severe stroke, or frontal lobe damage, there's no way that I would... I think even if I had frontal lobe damage I would still be able to draw my self-portrait everyday. I think, by now, I would not forget. I think it's so much a part of my daily life. Like eating or something, I might forget to eat, I might forget to bathe, or something like this, just because I'm wrapped all up in art. [dramatic music] [traffic] [light music] When it comes to the dark side in the arts and the tortured soul and the tortured artist, teachers, educators, and people will like to say that, "That's a myth and that you don't really need that." But there is some kind of connection there. I'm not going to lie, there is some kind of a connection because a person that is a tortured soul is a frustrated person, a person that has some kind of inner demons, or maybe they don't like mankind, or maybe there's things, like they love animals and they don't like people; the way people treat animals, or maybe they have real serious problems that they're witness to in these times. And it bothers them and creates a conflict in them and then they have no way to really express it. Art is the best way to express things culturally. You can go to church and witness, and give your testimony and say, "Oh, this terrible thing's happened," and stuff, and you have a support network in a church and stuff like that, but you don't... It's not your own pulpit, like art. You're a congegration member or something, and you get a little bit of time to ask for a prayer, or something like that. But art is like, you're the preacher, you're the pulpit, so it gives... I think it's a great motivational thing, the dark side, I'm not afraid of it at all. I'm not afraid to face that because I'm inspired, by a lot of that and I'm inspired by some desperation. Someone a long time ago said, "Desperation was a great inspirer." Feeling desperate, and then still continuing down your artistic path is a great inspirer. [deep piano music] The self portraits, I used them for long time I would tell people I was growing my feelings. I was using them to grow my feelings because I kind of had some sociopathic tendencies but a lot of people wouldn't necessarily see it because I can pretend. I see how other people that are emotional all the time, and I can imitate it to... Not a great actor, like a professional type of actor but I can act like I feelings really well. But I would use the self-portraits to put my real feelings in there; I called it my true feelings. I would use the self-portraits everyday as a way of purging the negative feelings and allowing myself to have more positive feelings; dealing with stress daily, like a therapy. So I think it's really helped a lot. [dramatic music] I don't know if there was a magic, eureka moment, I don't know if I ever experienced a magical, eureka moment where I would say, "I'm going to be a professional, full-time artist." But I know the day I drew the first self-portrait and the series of all of them in my life I knew this was my life calling because I knew that the possibilities were endless and infinite. And I can do them under any circumstances; if I have a headache, I do a headache one. I have insomnia or something, I can do an insomnia one, if I'm totally exhausted I'll draw till I fall asleep. No matter what the circumstances are I can do a self-portrait. It's really ingrained in my central nervous system. January 6, 1999, I'd been doing a self-portrait everyday since March 30 of '95 and had never missed a day. After I did this one, I realized there's no way I will ever miss a day. I didn't remember doing it, I had gotten into that argument with that girl in the other book where we were breaking up or something. Well I got really drunk on some cheap liquor early times and it was a snowstorm, like a blizzard. I just remember getting lost and falling down in the snow and I kept finding my way back to the liquor store. Then I ended up at this girl's house and she let me in and then I spent the night there, or whatever, and she took me back the next day. And I felt so hungover and just awful and I thought, "Oh man," on the ride back, I was like, "I did not even do my self-portrait yesterday. "Oh my god, I missed a day, I can't believe it." Then when I came into the office I opened up the door and my book was laid out just like this, and that picture was on the page. And I was like, "Oh my gosh," and she was there with me and she looked at it and said, "You sounded exactly like that on the phone. "You sounded exactly like that." And that's when I knew, because it was like a drunken blackout, and I still did the self-portrait. Then I knew, unless I'm in a coma, I would never have to worry about missing a day. [dramatic music] Oh, I think I was in the process here of starting to break up with this girl. Yeah. Oh, I was crying. This is probably one of three pictures, total, out of 9,000 where I drew it while I was crying. There's another one I did where my aunt, my great-aunt passed away, and I was crying a little bit. I don't really cry too terribly much, or anything. [dramatic music] Whoa, that break up must have been really troubling. Yeah, here she goes. "Doing better." She was a really short girl. [dramatic music] I'm not so concerned with composition and figure ground and all these types of things. I don't think of drawing; when I do the self-portraits I don't think of them as... I think of them as all as one piece together. I don't think of each day as an individual work of art, really at all. Even though I might like one and share it with some people, show some people or something. If it's crappy I don't care because it's the act that's more important to me than the final product. I had this real feeling that filled my whole entire being that no one way of interpreting myself should set the standard for the way I see the world. Because, you know, I was taking art history classes and things, and all of these artists like Van Gogh would see the world one way; Cezanne would see the world another way. And Paul McCartney, a performance artist, sees the world another way. Everybody from hundreds of years has being seeing the world in their own unique way. And I thought, the truth to me was that everyone is different, and then I thought, "They really encourage you in school "to develop your own style, your own "unique way of seeing the world." And they give you these assignments where you try out all these different types of ways of doing different media. So that way you can get, like, a bigger palette to interpret your expression. But I don't know, something in my physical body was just like, "Wow." Today is not the same as yesterday and if I'm happy one day, and then I'm sad the next day, why do I have to limit myself, limit my media palette to this one form of expression? But I knew that if I did this everyday it would come out. I knew that subconsciously, or even consciously, I would be able to have a means of expression that was really super-rich. [dramatic music] [island music] Very rarely will I just be an abstract thing. Usually I try to at least represent myself somewhat. Here's me as an island; I made myself an island. We'll skip that one. [chuckles] Let's see. I don't know, these are probably... I don't know why I'm crawling. Something happened. Oh, uh, I was mad about a sandwich. That's strange. Going back to this one where I was an island, where I said I hardly ever draw myself, like abstract, where there's no representation, this writing it looks like some kind of nonsense, "Mudaks and vudaks and woodaduku, "mujudak mujadak daku maku." It sounds like the ramblings of something of a weird person, but really what it is, is I had read a book by Nietzsche that said, "I had a pain and call it "dog"." And one of the first steps toward controlling pain is to name it. So what I did, was... Well because you'll probably see later on in some of the other books, like some stomach aches and stuff like this. I was plagued all in my youth with these terrible, terrible stomach aches. Well, after I read that I named it "Daku" and so this like some weird type of trying to make a little nursery rhyme or something out of it. But years later once I started performing I ended up making an album about the evolution of my interpretation of pain over the years. And then the album is called "Daku". Daku is the negative side and maku's the positive side that I just have in there. [dramatic music] A couple thousand of them are just a daily purging of anxiety and stress. Like a mental health maintenance. Sometimes I will be happy with myself and do something kind of like that and, like, I say, "Oh, it's okay to love yourself," or something [deep piano music] This one, I think I was a little bit blue, and little bit depressed. I had noticed, over the years, that when I do black and white drawing it's depression but I was thinking of all these colors, like the color of life or something. But it was just a thought, like I didn't have a color in my life. So I forced myself to put the color in my life. It kind of looks stressful now. [train horn] Yellow and green to me have always been... I see other people, other artists' artworks and they use a lot of yellow and green. To me it's a sign of mental illness because yellow, they want some kind of spirituality and the green, they want some kind of calming thing. But when you put... They're trying to express themselves and do something, but they're having some kind of problems and so a lot of times yellow's spiritual and then they went to calm, but when you put the yellow and green together it's really electrifying and it shows their mania and their not really aware of it. I've got this... Probably my heart's cut out, or something. That girl cheated on me so I did a yellow and green one on purpose. I must have been thinking I was having some type of little bit of mental problem. [intense music] I had a spontaneous pneumothorax; my right lung just popped. [intense music] That's my painting from the hospital and I did this one in the emergency room. Here's me in the hospital, and you can't really see it, but they had a monitor or something, that's an IV bag, I guess. They had a chest tube and everything. It was pretty crazy, but it's happened before. Oh yeah, here's the chest tube right there and I made myself kind of surreal, like part of the equipment. I don't know what kind of medicine they had me on at that time. And there's me looking in the mirror. I finally got up and was able to walk around a little bit and then look in the mirror. And then there's the chest tube going in there. It was real painful. There's the scab, the scar, not the scab. I was drawing the open wound that I had. They don't seal it off whenever you have an open chest wound. It has to heal from the inside out, they can't just stitch it up. That's what it looked like in the mirror. Then I got some kind of chest infection. Here's me as some kind of crazy little voodoo trying to make that chest would, chest pain thing into some kind of, like, a talisman, or some kind of magical thing. This is after Picasso's "Women of Avignon" and my open wound is an eye and a mouth and vagina, for the ego, the superego and the id. I just put myself in the same poses as the women from that very famous painting. And then the scar almost healed up completely and I'm sitting in this building, one floor down I lived in a different apartment. Some guy gave me some religious picture; I don't have it anymore. Oh, then I started riding my bike. I got a bike, that's the day I got my brand new bike helmet. And the doctors said, "What can't you do?" on the follow-up for my pneumothorax. And I was like, "What do you mean, "what can't I do? I can do everything. "I've got a bike and everything." And they were like, "Really?" They were expecting me to not be able to go up and down stairs and stuff, but it's happened so many times I've had a pneumothorax, if I get too stressed out one of my lungs will just pop. I'm real used to it. I get a pain in my chest when he's not in his nest. I can't walk when he's hungry. I can't sleep when he's lonely. I've often tried to talk to the Daku but he doesn't listen very well, either. He's unruly and I think Daku is deaf. If I stabbed him I'd be certain of relief. Daku hates to be petted so I poke at him. He's outgrowing his tank. Daku can also eat in two different places at the same time. He's right here just begging me to stab him, gut him, gut myself, pull him out and stomp of the Daku. Daku is no friend, Daku is killing me! [dramatic music] One time when I was, 19, I had major depression and I stayed in a room, I was living with my girlfriend at the time and I stayed in a room for, like, six months in a straight, hardly ever left the room but to use the bathroom. I've had times where I've had some types of delusions of grandeur. [dramatic music] That's a weird one. Me, like a little kid, holding a teddy bear. My childhood, I would say, is probably colorful. I had a single mother for a long time, I stayed with my grandparents quite a bit during summers. I think drew circles prematurely, like age one. Then it wasn't but a week or two later I started putting eyes in them. [dramatic music] When I was 1 1/2 I was potty trained and I went straight to school after that. And was reading when I was two years old and was in the gifted and talented programs all through school. I wasn't really a prodigy or anything because I never got to nurture it but then as I got a little bit older I started not being interested in school anymore, it was kind of boring. I felt like they were holding me back. I was also a latch key kid, so was I home alone a whole lot. I had wear this awful red yarn with a key on it and it would rub me all day because if I lost my key or something I would have no way to get into the house. But my mother showed me how to break-in to the house with a knife through the kitchen window. When I was 10, I started getting in trouble with the law. If my mother wasn't coming home after work, I... All the other kids had to go in at dinner-time, I could stay outside forever. But it was dark; I was more scared of the house, than I was the dark so I started... By the time I was 11 or 12, I started breaking into people's houses after they died and would go through their stuff and hang out in these other people's houses. [chuckles] It's a strange thing. It just my mind would wander, like, one lady died across the street. She was elderly and I broke into her house and I stayed in there for a couple weeks. I wasn't every missing; I went to school, come home before my mom got home and stuff like that, but if I found some swords, or something from her travels, I would play with them and give them to the other kids. I'd steal her TV and stuff. [chuckles] Just to hang out in the people's houses after they died. [dramatic music] I would, rather than play outside or in some dead person's house than in my own house because for some reason, I had this irrational fear, paranoia of the bad people. I had really no concept of what they were. I just had this vague idea that the bad people were killers. Anyone whoever got killed was killed by these mysterious bad people. One lady down the street, Olga, she got murdered and they played the 9-1-1 tape on TV and her husband had escaped, or something. He got furloughed or something from a mental hospital and stabbed her all up and every time he stabbed her, he was screaming her name, Olga. He was going, "Ol-ga, Ol-ga, Ol-ga, Ol-ga," like that and then she was screaming to death, she screamed until she died. And that really haunted me; that type of thing really scared me. So I was just always afraid of these bad people. I just always thought they were somewhere around. I had this whole ritual before I went to sleep at night. I would pretend like I was dead already so that if the bad people found me and tried to kill me they would see I was already dead. And I would have this elaborate set-up like a funeral or something, and I would sleep next to the open window in the summertime. [eerie music] I was picked on a lot by the older kids because they could stay out longer, so if some of these older high school kids, they would try to beat me up. Then I would take it out on... I would just pass the beating down the line. I would only have one friend at at time; they would be my best friend, inseparable, and then I would eventually beat them up and then look for a new friend and be their friend for awhile and beat them up. Then after a while nobody was allowed to play with me probably by the time I was about 13, I'd say. I used art a lot of times, at least in the beginning, a whole lot. Maybe not the self-portraits, but with the performances, to purge myself of the trauma. Traumatic events, I would relay them, like an exorcism or something, just let it all out, all of these terrible things. But my mother, she has no idea, all these crazy things that went on. She might remember a few incidents, or something with me with the police, but she had no idea the types of things I was a witness to, or subjected to. I don't know because when you're a boy you're supposed to suck it up. You don't really tell your mother that Officer [beep], the one you think is supposed to be helping people is molesting all the troubled kids. You don't uh... You know, you got a single mom and you're a boy, you just got to suck it up, really. [dramatic music] I think this is around the time that I was graduating. I graduate from ETSU in the summer of '98, so there'll probably be some of the pictures in there about that. The dorm was like a prison with the cinder block walls. I just had these scribbles on this old palette and it's like some tensions are flying off, it's a self-constructed wall it looks like I'm trying to build in my brain. I really felt comfortable in the college and the dormitory; I stayed in the dormitory five years, every semester, even summer school because it was just convenient, and stuff, and I didn't mind it. I been in prison one time, a long time ago, and I got used to it. There's some anxiety; that's nuts. I was under a whole lot of stress going to college. It was really hard for me to do assignments. The called the ACLU on me one time because I sewed my mouth shut for this photography student. They had the lawyers come, and they had this big meeting, and everything. They had more than one meeting on me. But was this one was the big one. And then I had to jump through a lot of hoops in order to graduate. Even if my faculty, my teachers, advisors and stuff would say, "Oh, we recommend," at the evaluation, "you skip two or three years worth of stuff "and just take 5,000 level advanced "classes, electives and stuff like that." The head chairman said, "No, if he wants "to graduate he has to jump through every hoop, "he has to do everything just like everybody else "and he does not get special treatment." That guy really held me back, big time. And I didn't like to do assignments. They would have me make a painting; like in the syllabus it would say, I think one of the said, "Make a drawing that weighed five pounds," and I told the teacher... I mean, that stuff really stressed me out, kept me up at night, all night, and I would think, "How am I going to approach this "and not fly off the handle and get upset?" But I would say, "If I make any drawing "that weighs five pounds, it's automatically garbage." It doesn't have anything to do with me. I have my life purpose, I'm going to draw myself everyday for the rest of my life. If I make a drawing that weighs five pounds, I don't want it; that's silliness. And they would say, "You have to do this, "you have to do that." I would never do it; I would never do it. [dramatic music] That's the last day of classes. Last class, last exam, last hoop, last jump. I look kind of blue, kind of down, but I probably was really relieved to get out of there. This is funny; here's me in a diaper with a ski mask on. I don't know why, but at the time, still to me it speaks to me something about being a baby and in a violent ski mask. And I made this nail-studded paddle for an Intro to Sculpture class and on one side of the paddle, I don't know if you can really tell, I painted welts, and flesh-colored welts so it looked, like, you saw that nails and it was like a before and after. But the teacher did not want me to come back into class because she thought I was going to spank myself with it. But my girlfriend at the time took all of these Polaroids of me with the ski mask and the diaper and I would just scribble red pen on it and make it look like some kind of spank yourself or something. And I would leave these... I still have quite a few of them left, like probably 20 or so, and I would leave them in people's places, like in their car, or different stuff and it was kind of like a funny thing to do. People would find it and then they'd feel like... [laughs] They'd freak out. [laughs] One time I left one under... I was house-sitting and they had a big tub of sour cream in the refrigerator and I left a Polaroid of me in the ski mask and the diaper under it. Well, apparently that sour cream had gone totally sour and they never moved it until they moved out of the apartment. So a year later of something, when they moved out, they were cleaning out the refrigerator and they found it and they thought, "Oh my gosh! We've been violated. "Some psychopath freak has come in here "and took pictures of the ski mask and a diaper." But then they saw the tattoos and they realized it was me. [laughs] And I just think that's funny, sometimes. I still do it, but, you never know what happens if the people meant to find them will find them. That's just a regular; probably some anxiety. Then, my best friend, Don Morgan, shot himself in the head. Don, he had some mental problems. He had gone to some kind of inpatient treatment for a couple of days and his girlfriend had me go over and try to clean up the bloodstain before his parents came from Chattanooga. And the more I was scrubbing it, the bigger the puddle kept getting until, finally, I just left it. I don't know how you clean up that stuff. He was in the ICU and I was wanting to trade places with him and stuff. And then I had to call his family and I was like a robot, or something. Then I had to get to the free mental health and tell them, "Oh my gosh, my best friend "shot himself in the head." Oh, here's me crying again; it looks more like I was trying to force myself to cry. I don't think I was really crying too much. Actually, that looks like a real teardrop. This is probably a water color, chalk, that is some tears on there, so I guess, yeah I was probably really crying. But it's not too many times I do that. [dramatic music] [knocking] Hey, come in; kitchen. To the left is the closet. People tell me that I'm like some frightening and some scary. Well, now, because of the drug things online people say I'm an attention whore or I'm a liar, like I make these things up to get attention, or you know, because I want publicity. Here's the bathroom if you need to use it. - And this is the cool shot, right there. I do a lot of painting in the bathtub to relax. So those water color crayons in the corner are for drawing. - [Voiceover] Nice, cool, okay. They say I'm doing some gimmicks to make money but I'm like, "Oh my gosh, they're in some fantasy land." Because if I had some money, I would not be living in this type of place. I would not be living in squalor. That's how a lot of people see me. Okay, then here, are my releases, basically my merchandise, like old stock, that's my inventory stock. And these are the ones that haven't released yet, that are still being developed, but they're still products. I was having a really strange experience where I was waking up with seizures and I was having a fit and the world would be too bright, my fists would be all clenched up and I'd be shaking, like this. And I would have this feeling that I was being born, physically, for the first time ever. And then these are documents of projects past. No, not these two, but these boxes, and these things here. And after the first couple mornings waking up like this, with the seizure fit and everything, and being born for the first time, it was really scary. And then the third day, the third morning, I wake up, I'm twisted around with the blanket all wrapped up around me and I'm thinking, "I'm a breach birth," like the umbilical cord or something's wrapped up around my neck, and I'm choking and I'm dying, I'm being born, and the world's too bright and I'm shaking, and then I said to Nicole, "Oh my gosh, what if I'm a C-Section?" This is art supplies and media. And then these are the photographs that I find in the trash constantly. Then, the next morning after that, after having a wonderful, peaceful sleep, I wake up, I'm having a seizure, I'm thinking I'm being born again for the first time, physically. I called it a near-birth experience. And there's walkie talkies just going off over my head, like, "Kssh, calling 124, kssh," and all this stuff... And then this little closet is a clothes closet. And I can barely walk, I'm practically crawling and using the walls with my shoulder to get to the front door and I look through the peephole and there's cops here, and cops here, and my neighbor across the hall door's wide open and there's a dead lady laying in the middle of the kitchen floor. And so I went from a near-birth experience to a instant tunnel-vision of death. These are DVDs, art films, art DVDs that I used to really love but I don't have time to watch anymore. That's the only time I've every really contemplated moving out of here, I thought, "It's getting too close." Then I opened up the door and looked and they picked her up in a sheet like she was on the streets of Syria and they just slung her onto to the gurney right in front of my door. Then the next morning I woke up and I didn't have the seizure, pushed the button for the elevator door, door opens up and there's a dead body on there with the cops, and the cop's like, "You can't come on, on this one." And I was like, "Oh my god, it's closing in." And these people next door to me used to party all the time and they hadn't been partying and I was like, "Oh my god, if this guy's dead "I'm outta here," because it's just coming too close to me. The last closet is the potluck closet. And it's got tools, bicycle pump, all my books. I don't have a whole lot of books. Even though I don't socialize and interact with these people, it was just getting to be too much death, and with this near-birth experience, seizure craziness, that's the only time I've ever thought about leaving. I love this place so much, no matter what happens, I love it. [dramatic music] When I first moved into this building in 2000, or something, my original goal was to make a documentary about all of the interesting people that live in this building, from veterans, to elderly people, just all different types of people. And this building is really well known for having a whole lot of interesting characters. So I was going to do a documentary but then I never felt comfortable. Most people don't even leave their apartment and they're all on drugs, some of them are so messed up, on psyche meds, that the case manager once told me that if she could get them out of their chair, recliner, lounge chair, three times a day, that was a good day for them. And it was really boring, I never did a documentary. I started a new sketchbook and this is what I wrote: Theme: pill, medicine and drug experiment Every single person in my apartment building takes pills and or drugs; I live in a big building. They say someone can get every kind of pill there is in my apartment. The experiment is to take every single kind and draw myself under the influence of every drug and every pill and note the changes. That was my big delusion of grandeur, I could take all these pills. And the first day I got a hold of something called Butalbitals, they were pain pills; I took four of them. Then the next day I took Valium. Then I took a break from the pills and I drank all these liquor drinks. I was sitting at the bar drawing myself it was looking pretty good but then it got to where I had get someone to make a map of how I get back home. I was just scribbling and stuff, I was all messed up on liquor. This one I took some Percocets. This is Lortabs, it made my nose really itchy. Didn't do too much else to me, just made my nose itch. And this one is huffing Nitrous Oxide, laughing gas. And then this one is Xanax; this one was my favorite of all. It made me feel most earthy and peaceful. Then this one, someone came... All these pills were things people just gave to me because they heard about my project. Every time someone would give me something they would tell someone about it, so people were just knocking on my door left and right and saying, "When I was a kid "we used to do this; or here's this." This girl cleaned out here medicine cabinet and she gave me one blue, one milligram Xanax, one and a half rocks of [mumbles], one Vicodin and then a totem pole. And I just took them all. Originally I was going to do one a day but then by the time I think I got to about... This one says I took a day off and did nothing but Percocet. So I think I was already doing more than one a day but I'd wait until it wore off and I felt normal, and then I would do another one. But by this day I was taking more than one thing at a time. It was getting to be quite a bit. Then I did mushrooms, the psychedelic mushrooms. Right as it started kicking in, my eyes started getting bigger, and colors, and then my whole... It's weird, all these pixels started radiating and flying out of my face. By the time it got to here I couldn't even draw anymore, so it ended. I mean, the drawing ended at a good point, I got a lot of details and stuff. This one, after that, the next day I went to a psychiatrist and I said, "Here's my pictures on all these different drugs, "I'm doing this experiment." Nobody had given me anything else after the mushrooms and I said, "I just want a prescription for one pill "of every type of thing I haven't done yet." And what he did instead was he thought I was psychotic for taking all these different pills. So he gave me a prescription for 100 Seroquel pills, which are heavy tranquilizers and it was the worst experience of my life. The worst drug I have ever ingested was a Seroquel tranquilizer pill. You can see I was having to fight it the whole time, to be just to draw. I started off doing the proportions, getting the ears and the cheeks and the eyes and everything right, and then all of a sudden something inside me, like an inner voice said, "Don't look at the mirror!" So then I just kept drawing in the book. And then the same voice said, "Don't look at your book!" Then I thought, "Oh my gosh, I may need to lay down." And I looked over at my bed and it said, "Don't look at your bed," like that, and I was just stuck. The medicine was trying to cut my brain off from my body. It really effects you, probably your nervous system and I had to physically force myself to keep drawing through the worst feeling ever. And it was then that I realized that when they shoot a lion with a tranquilizer dart, or if a bear gets trapped in a tree and they need to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart, it always looks to me like it's drunk, like in La-la Land, but it's not. In real life that lion still wants to chew their throats out of all those people It just can't move; that inner voice is saying, "Don't rip their throats out," like that. So it's scary, one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. Then, this is Ambien. And I kept getting lower and lower to the floor, by the time I got to my body, my arm was not even attached in the same place. Then Buspar, I snorted... I crushed it up and snorted it because they said it would act faster that way. Then I drank a bunch of cough syrup. And my friend, when she saw this, she said, "You're giving yourself Down Syndrome," but I already knew that, kind of, subconciously because I found this Korean book in the trash and found a picture of a girl with Down Syndrome and put it on there. And I was drunk, almost hallucinating on cough syrup and I went to this Chinese restaurant up the street to ask what this meant because I knew there was the lady at the, when you walk in, the greeter, was Korean, so I was trying to find out what it meant and she wrote something and that said, "A very beautiful woman." So here's me and some Korean; it's very strange. Then this was huffing lighter fluids. Some old man knocked on my door and he said, "When I was a kid we used to huff lighter fluid," and he just stuffed his hand, gave me some lighter fluid. He said, "Put it on a sock, stick in a brown bag, "and just breathe that stuff and you'll get real messed up." And I did it, but I really liked the fact that I subconsciously picked this metallic crayons because it really shows the fumes. When I look at it I can still smell it and see the fumes and the blurry eye, like that metal smell or something. Then this one was Ritalin. It didn't really do too much to me, really. Like, in the other books you've seen more wild. Then this one, I made PCP. My face, you can see it's coming off in sections and then this is some vomit, not in real life, this is drawing, painted, but I vomited. I had eaten a sandwich earlier that day that had some tomato in it and then did the PCP and everything, then someone knocked on my door and said, "Oh, I heard you was on the Appalachian Trail, "and you got a lot of pictures and stuff." So invited them all in and I was sitting around telling 40 different people that... I was showing them the Appalachian Trail book and then something told me, "Bryan, these people aren't real." And I was like, "Whoa, this is messed up!" Then there'd a knock at the door and they'd say, "Oh hi, Bryan, I heard "you were on the Appalachian Trail." I let them all in, 20,30 people and after, like, a half hour or so, showing them all that book and telling them all these crazy stories, BAM, these people aren't real. [laughs] And I would totally freak out. After I realized the third or fourth time that this kept happening, I went and vomited and all this red stuff was coming out of my nose and I thought, "Oh my god, my brain is falling out of my nose." But it wasn't; it was that tomato that was in that sandwich. But I was on PCP and I thought my brain was falling out. And then that's when I quit. I mean, I've done others since then but that's when that little experiment ended. I couldn't keep going on like that; it was crazy. [dramatic music] When I was living with my aunt, my second cousin, which was a small child, and her mother, and my grandmother and my great-aunt, there was a lot of chaos. I was living in a trailer in central Virginia and a lot of arguing and typical family-type of drama but it was somewhat stressful because the child was involved. My great-aunt, she was in the last stages of Alzheimer's and couldn't remember anything past 18 seconds, so she was constantly repeating the same questions. My grandmother had a couple strokes, there was just all this stress around me. And so I thought, "Well, I'd like to go to China." I thought if I went to China and I heard all of these people talking in Chinese I wouldn't mind, like, I could live with that. Then I thought, "Well, if I go to China, "I've heard so much stuff," like they drown their girl babies, there's just so much outrageous things. All my life, from elementary school on, I've heard all these outrageous things, and I thought, "Well, if I go there, I better learn Chinese first, "in case the people started yelling at me "I'll know what they're saying." So for 6 hours a day, everyday, 7 days a week for 9 months straight, I taught myself Mandarin Chinese. While I was doing this I would go, every now and then, to the Chinese restaurant in town and I could practice, and say some things. Then there was a waiter I befriended and he would come over once a week and I would teach him English. We didn't really do too much; I did the Chinese all on my own, but I really tried to help him learn English. But somewhere along that line I thought to myself, "Well, if I learn Mandarin Chinese," and I know it really well, I go to some city in China where there's no foreigners at all, no tourism, no white people; I'm the only white person there and I tell jokes in Chinese and do stand-up comedy, I thought, "Well, I could become "a famous comedian instantly." Because they have so many millions of people. Then I thought, "If I do stand-up comedy "in China, within nine months I'll have my own sitcom," and stuff, like Seinfeld or something, And then I thought, "Well, right after "that I'll be doing blockbuster movies, I'll become a superstar, a Chinese superstar." And I really believed that this could be a real possibility. Then I did a Chinese wedding in New York after about nine months of teaching myself Mandarin I performed my, I wrote a routine and everything, and I performed my stand-up comedy at a Chinese wedding and it was a big hit, and I thought, "Well, this is a real possibility. "I'm doing it, I'm going to China, "I'm going to become a famous stand-up comedian. "Within a year, or a little over a year, "I'll be a Chinese superstar." Then I get to China and after a couple days I met a guy on the street that had lived in the United States for quite a while and he spoke English and I said, "Where is the stand-up comedy? "I want to be a stand-up comedian." And he said, "We don't have that here." and I was like, "Oh my gosh." All my dreams were completely shattered. Then when I found myself back in the United States I thought, "I cannot be a stand-up comedian." There's thousands and thousands of stand-up comedians, everyone wants to be a stand-up comedian, there's just so much luck involved and all this other type of business trying to do that. And then I'm here, back in this nasty place where I was a long time ago. And I was like, "The hell with it, "I'm going to start stand-up tragedy." Instead of making strangers laugh in public I'm going to make them cry. I started doing it at this coffee shop. I was nervous, like stage fright, so I read other people's poetry, or some writings, but I read it my own way because, see, I'd been doing the self-portraits the whole time, for over 10 years. It was putting all of my feelings into a little 8.5 by 11.5 inch sketchbook page. So I was constantly putting all my feelings into this confining little place. Then when I started to decide, "Okay, I'm going to do this other stuff," it was an explosion of emotion. I was bottled up into such a little tiny place, surface area. When I started reading the other people's poetry I just went off, I just read it like I wanted to; as aggressive as I wanted, as deranged sounding, or whatever I wanted, I just did it really outrageously Then I started writing my own stuff. I'd read these other people's things; I did it twice, reading other people's stuff, then I wrote one thing, or two things, and then I went and did it again the next week that way, with my own stuff and it had even more emotion in it. Then one of the side goals in my mind was to make psychopaths or sociopaths have feelings. I've been concerned with this quite a bit. So I tried to use videos, microphone. My name is Bryan Lewis Saunders, I'm 16 and I'm allergic to popcorn. Sounds, experimental music to evoke as much feeling into people as possible. I was hoping I could do it so intense that even a psychopath would have feelings and be upset. I was a little bit delusional because no matter what the people, the psychopaths would take it the wrong way. You can say anything about some animal torture or something and they will think it's funny. It just depends on who the people are but the psychopath that's there in the audience, you not doing nothing for them but entertaining them. They got off on some crazy stuff. [melancholy music] [eerie music] The word "daku" has many definitions, like love, time, God, or any other word. Its meaning is its use. By this I simply mean that its definition lies in our daily conversation. So for someone to say, "What is God," "What is time," or "What is Daku," creates linguistic superstitions. It creates a mystery where there really isn't one. We know what it is by how we use it. Before I divulge the impact that Daku has had on my life it is both necessary and vital that I first share with you the origins of Daku. [eerie music] My first experience with the mysterious stomach pain occurred when I was 16. I was at a movie theater with a friend of mine, named Craig Whines, eating popcorn in an aisle seat when WHAM, I got broadsided by the most excrutiating gigabolt of pain comprehensible to man. It doubled me over and my right arm stiffened and stopped me from falling and rolling all the way out into the aisle. I could have make a somersault out of it. But you don't show pain in public. After the initial shock, it felt as if the whole left side of my abdomen was being pinched by an industrial strength metal clothespin that had been heated up and stuck where a drill bit is supposed to go and then run in reverse, drawing me up tighter and tighter until is stripped around, triple knotted, burning more tissue in my gut and I couldn't move. Emotionally, fear and anger are brother and sister, stay with me here. My anticipation of more pain equals fear and my perception of doctors as ignorant equals anger, and when both of these feelings taboo fornicate inside my head I became the proud father of a bouncing, new baby bad blood emotional incest offspring of hatred towards man like none I've ever known before. I have this little pet; it's name is Daku. All of his teeth and claws came in, I no longer eat, I only feed him. He can't be killed unless I die. He is an invisible part of me. Daku is bad mystery. No one, not even doctors with all of their machines can see him, machines might make him high but medicine makes him angry. And we don't want him angry! He digs and claws, meats and tears, rips and gnaws and chews tunnels in my gut always moving forwards. Sometimes I feel like rescuing him by taking a knife and freeing him. Cut Daku out! Sometimes I think he's cancer. Daku says "yes", but the doctors say "no." I get a pain in my chest when he's not in his nest. I can't walk when he's hungry, I can't sleep when he's lonely. I've often tried to talk to the Daku but he doesn't listen very well, either. He's unruly and I think Daku is deaf. If I stabbed him I'd be certain of relief. Daku hates to be petted so I poke at him. He's outgrowing his tank. Daku can also eat in two different places at the same time. He's right here just begging me to stab him, gut him, gut myself, pull him out and stomp on the Daku. Daku is no friend, Daku is killing me! ["killing me" echoes] [crowd cheers] [melancholy paino music] [upbeat music] A lot of the time people, I think, when it comes to me they're just trying to figure out if what I'm doing is even real or not. I don't fault them with it; it's just the times we live in. I consider myself weird, I know I'm weird. If you isolate yourself, you develop weird ideas. I wouldn't film me walking through here, though. Let's take these stairs. Because I interact socially with people online and with the phone, I'm not totally alone and I've got friends that can say, "You're getting a little bit... "That's too much, that's too weird, "That's not really the politically correct way "to go about expressing that," I get feedback. I will say that I'm definitely strange, I would definitely say I would think of myself as weird. Some people might think of me as creepy; I don't think I'm creepy, I think that people might be creeps themselves and see something of that creepy nature in them, and then be like, "Oh, that's creepy." because it maybe affects them. I don't set out to be like, "Oh, I'm going "to be as creepy as possible," or something like that. If I was going to do that, I'd be a real creep, I mean I would creep people out big-time, more than they could handle it. I don't have any desire to do that. I'm sure that some people think that I'm creepy. But I tell stories like this. It doesn't haunt me so much, like, I don't still fear the bad people. I really became one of them. I still have this negative self-image a lot of times, like, oh I'm a bad person, I became one of the bad people. But people that know me now, and don't know anything about me in this past other than what I say during my performances or in my books, or dreams and things. They would never think I was a bad person. I use the art, really, to change my life and become a good person. I need to more accepting that I am a good person, try to be a good person but I fear under certain stress, or some situations, social situations, I could easily revert; I have that ingrained into me that kind of anger, and lack of emotions sometimes and I have to try to really stay focused. And I isolate myself, really, so I don't get involved in that. [dramatic music] When it comes to the dark side in the arts, and the tortured soul, the tortured people are the ones that give a shit. The tortured people are the people that care. So there's nothing wrong with that. And art is probably the greatest tool we have right now to deal with it, to deal with all of it. I'd say there's a real great link. Some kids get into art because they don't know what else to do, so at the universities they'll tell them, "Well, you don't have to be tortured, "you don't have to do this, you can just like images," but a lot of times I think there's something lacking. I would suggest that if someone is not upset they want to be an artist, they like art, they think it's really interesting, and they're not upset, I'd say find something to get upset about. Go there and then you can really be inspired and do some great stuff that will provoke other people to use their brains. Because there's not even enough people in the Western world really even using their brains anymore, and it gets worse as time goes by, that they're doing less thinking, more repeating, more cut and paste. So I would recommend to people get tortured, become a tortured soul, really. I don't suggest go out and get drunk or create problems for yourself, but I would just say, "Find out what bothers you "and explore it, find out what upsets you, "find out what really gets your goat, "what really pisses you off, and then explore that." Ask yourself, "Why is that, what is it about me "that makes react this way, or feel this way," and then go there. And they're going to do some interesting stuff no matter who they are; whether they're really that tortured or not. You don't have to be insane and ranting and raving, and flopping around and cutting parts of your body off to do great art; you just have to give a shit. You just have to care about something. And not enough people do. I would just recommend people care. [dramatic music] [theme music]
