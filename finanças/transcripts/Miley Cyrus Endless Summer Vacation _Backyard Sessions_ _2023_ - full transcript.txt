I don't wanna call and talk too long I know it's wrong But never said I was sorry Now I had time to think it over We're much older And the bone's too big to bury Oh Isn't it a shame That it ended like that? Said goodbye forever But you never unpacked We went to hell and we never came back Sorry that you're jaded I could've taken you places You're lonely now and I hate it I'm sorry that you're jaded You're not even willing To look at your part You just jump in the car And head down to the bar Till you're blurry You don't know when to stop So you take it too far I don't know where you are And I'm left in the dark Till I'm worried Ooh, and it hurts me Oh Isn't it a shame That it ended like that? Broke your own heart But you'd never say that We went to hell and we never came back - Sorry that you're - Jaded - Oh, I could've taken you - Places Yeah, you're lonely now and I hate it I'm sorry that you're jaded I won't lie, it won't be easy When somebody new is on your body I'll change my number But keep your T-shirt I don't mind it's torn up and faded - I'm sorry that you're - Jaded - Oh, I could've taken you - Places Yeah, you're lonely now and I hate it I'm sorry that you're jaded Oh Sorry that you're jaded I think Endless Summer Vacation represents, to me, my fearlessness when it comes to experimenting not just with my sound, but also with my identity and the way that I want to be seen. Whether that's visually with my hair, with my looks, with the visuals accompanying the music. This album feels like it's kind of a concoction of all of the best of those sounds that I've tried out. I've been calling this album the Cinderella shoe because it's just a perfect fit and it feels like it's only mine and it could only be mine. Here we go. Set. Nice and quiet. Everybody, hold still, please. We're rolling sound on this. Sunrise got us up early So we put on our shades Somehow, the bed sheets are dirty Like sticky, sweet lemonade I never wanna leave this room Daydream, déjà vu If I had control over you We could stay like this forever Lost in wonderland With our head above the clouds Falling stupid like we're kids Wearing rose-colored lenses Let's just play pretend Wearing rose-colored lenses Pretend we'll never end Naked in conversation Drown me in your delight Endless summer vacation Make it last till we die My baby's got looks that kill Make a mess of a nice hotel If I had control over you We could stay like this forever Lost in wonderland With our head above the clouds Falling stupid like we're kids Rose-colored lenses Let's just play pretend Rose-colored lenses Pretend we'll never end Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever We could stay like this forever Lost in wonderland With our head above the clouds Falling stupid like we're kids Rose-colored lenses Let's just play pretend Rose-colored lenses Pretend we'll never end Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever Let's stay like this forever When I'm writing a song, I try to be really descriptive in my lyrics and paint a picture of the moment in time that the song stemmed from. So, the visuals are pretty vivid in the words. You know, whether it's "sticky, sweet lemonade" like in Rose Colored Lenses. You know, you can kinda taste that. The fun thing is, if you're a friend of mine, if you're close to me, and you listen to this album, it sounds like a conversation with me. There's subtle shade. There's, you know, honesty and truth, and there's some wisdom, and there's some humor. And there's some heaviness and depth. It really represents who I am. And I feel that the greatest records that I've been able to make or the greatest songs that I've been able to write, they do exactly that. They just really connect me and whoever's listening in a way that feels like an intimate, honest conversation. So this is the one that I said no one... - Ah. - They might not use it. But I can't fake it, so I'm gonna tell you the truth. But I might get a little emotional. Have to collect myself. When I wrote Thousand Miles, it started as a song that was very different from the one that's on the album. I wrote it in 2016 or 2017. And it was after one of my really close friends lost her sister to suicide. And, um, I just couldn't imagine not having my little sister in my life. And... So I wrote this song for her, and it was originally called Happy Girl. And it was, "I just wanna see you happy, "and all I really want is just for you to be happy, girl." And it was just about happiness and sisterhood and... It just makes me emotional because now the song is filled with so much joy in the music. And, um, it's become something so far from the sadness that inspired the song. My makeup still beat? Thank you. Amazing I'm driving around town In a beat-up old Mercedes You think I'm crazy Well, you might be right But when he smiles I don't care about the past Just like that I told myself I closed that door But I'm right back here again Half of what I'm saying Don't make no sense So don't ask me where I been I'm not always right But still I ain't got time For what went wrong Where I end up, I don't really care I'm out of my mind But still I'm holding on Like a rolling stone A thousand miles from anywhere I look in the rearview I'm talking to you Before I realize it's madness Before the sadness Oh, I pick up the phone And I call back home But all I get is a dial tone And instead of hanging up I hang my head I told myself I closed that door Now I'm right back here again I know half of what I'm saying Don't make no sense But don't ask me where I been I'm not always right But still I ain't got time For what went wrong Where I end up, I don't really care I'm out of my mind But still I'm holding on Like a rolling stone A thousand miles from anywhere I told myself I closed that door Now I'm right back here again Half of what I'm saying Don't make no sense So don't ask me where I been I'm not always right But still I ain't got time For what went wrong But where I end up I don't really care I'm out of my mind And still I'm holding on Like a rolling stone A thousand miles from anywhere Makes me emotional, so I'll see if I can sing it. But it said... There was a friend of mine Her name was Darlene But all of us called her Becky I don't know why I knew she was hurting But I never thought I'd wake up to that call Never at all And I remember on that day I promised you the world But soon realized The world ain't what you need Now all I want is simply For you to be a happy girl Even if that's a world without me And somehow it evolved to a song that's about happiness and joy and being okay with not knowing exactly where you're going, so... Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife Go and meet your mom In a dress too tight Maybe I could stay Not break your heart But don't forget, baby That I'm a wild card I love when you hold me But loving you is never enough And don't wait for me 'Cause forever may never come I'm a wild card, oh, oh Loving you is never enough I'm a wild card, oh, oh Forever may never come I walk in the door With my lips stained red Pillows on the floor And the flowers dead Make the music stop Before it starts But don't forget, baby That I'm a wild card I love when you hold me But loving you is never enough I'm a wild card Oh, hey Loving you is never enough I'm a wild card Oh, hey Forever may never come Ooh, bet your lovin' I want all in I want all or nothing Ooh, it'll cost ya I want all in I want all Or nothing You wanna play house? I could be your wife Go and meet your mom In a dress too tight The sequencing of an album is very important to me. I kind of think of it like a... like a film. You know, you want there to be a conflict and an overcoming. And when it comes to the sequencing of Endless Summer Vacation, I divided it by two parts, a.m. and p.m., to kind of represent almost like an act. And the a.m., to me, is representing the morning time, where there's, like, a buzz and an energy, and there's a potential of new possibilities. It's a new day. And in the nighttime, it feels that there's, like, a slinky seediness and kind of a grime, but a glamour at the same time. And, you know, in the evening, it's a great time for rest. It's a time to recover. Or it's a time to go out and experience kind of the wild side and... LA, there's a certain energy to the night that you can kind of feel trouble boil up to the surface, and it's... it's very inspiring to me. When I came up with an idea for Island, the idea was kind of, "Everyone is still a stranger to me, but I'm a stranger to no one." For me, I've been able to create these paradises where I feel safe. But I was contemplating this life that I have for myself, "Is it a paradise? Or is it a lonely island?" I'm on an island Dirty dancing in the sun So close to heaven But so far from everyone Yeah, I got treasure Buried underneath the sand But I'm still wishing for The love that I don't have Mama told me "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em" Left my lighter back at home With all my problems Now I'm sitting here Wondering all day long Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? I can paint my toenails While I'm soaking up the sea Only thing that's missing here Is you and our TV Yeah, I won't lie It sure gets lonely here at night No one here needs nothing from me And that's kinda nice Mama told me "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em" Left my lighter back at home With all my problems Now I'm sitting here Wondering all day long Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? I hear your voice Like a song on the radio All day long 'Cause, boy, I be missing you I hear your voice Like a song on the radio, ah I hear your voice Like a song on the radio All day long 'Cause, boy, I be missing you I hear your voice Like a song on the radio, ah Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? - Am I stranded on an island? - Missing you, your hands on my face - Have I landed in paradise? - You're my paradise Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? Am I stranded on an island? Or have I landed in paradise? My nails today are this 2000s French tip, 'cause, like, 2002 through '8 was a really strong time for me. I was in sixth grade. I was slaying. And when I saw women with French tips, I just always wanted to be like them. Whether that was Britney Spears or Pamela Anderson or even my mom. I remember my mom would, like, get her nails done in the kitchen, and she would always have these really long, gorgeous, feminine, sexy nails, but she was never afraid to break one. When we started writing the song Wonder Woman, the lyrics felt like too big of a shoe for me to fill. I wrote this song after my mom had lost her mom, and me and my mammy were really close. And she ran my fan club. If you ever got a... an autograph, like, from my fan club sent in for probably 2008 to 2018, that was my grandma. She responded back to every single fan. She ran the fan club in my dressing room at Hannah Montana. Then when we stopped doing Hannah Montana, my fan club was ran out of her apartment. And it was just the joy of her life being the head of my fan club. And she's always just supported me, and my mom and her mom were just really, really close. Me and my mom are really close. You know, this song is about, I guess, that kind of generational strength and the wisdom that my grandma gave to my mom. It was embedded in my DNA, so we almost all feel like just one woman in a way. One wonder woman. She's a wonder woman She knows what she likes Never know she's broken 'Cause she's always fine She's a million moments Lived a thousand lives Never know she's hopeless Only when she cries But when her favorite record's on And she's dancing in the dark She can't stop Her eyes from welling up Oh She makes sure that no one's round To see her fall apart She wants to be The one that never does She's a won't-stop woman Hours on her hands All the pain is polished All the tears are planned But when her favorite record's on And she's dancing in the dark She can't stop Her eyes from welling up Oh She makes sure that no one's round To see her fall apart She wants to be the one who never does She's a wonder woman She knows what she likes Never know she's broken Only when she Cries Boredom, for an artist, can feel like torture, so I always need to reinvent. And in this era, the way I've been doing that is bringing my audience into my endless summer vacation. And in a way, uh, it's a vacation from taking myself and the success of records so seriously, and just doing it for the reason I started writing music. Because I love it. Beginning and end. I can almost see it That dream I'm dreamin' We changed the key After 15 years, yeah What were we thinking? Okay, we're reset. The journey is usually the part that you remember anyways. Usually, the getting-there, once you're there, wherever that may be, you're like, "This is what I've been expecting?" And usually you look back, and the journey was actually the part that was what makes up your life. I can almost see it That dream I'm dreaming But there's a voice Inside my head saying "You'll never reach it" Every step I'm taking Every move I make feels lost With no direction My faith is shaking I, I gotta keep trying I gotta keep my head held high There's always gonna be Another mountain Always gonna wanna make it move Always gonna be an uphill battle Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose Ain't about how fast I get there Ain't about what's waiting On the other side Oh, yeah It's the climb The struggles I'm facing The chances I'm taking Sometimes might knock me down But, no, I'm not breaking And I may not know it But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah Just gotta keep going And I, I got to be strong And just keep pushing on Yeah, yeah Always gonna be another mountain Always gonna wanna make it move Always gonna be an uphill battle Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose It ain't about how fast I get there It ain't about what's waiting On the other side It's the climb Oh, yeah, yeah Whoa Always gonna be another mountain Always gonna wanna make it move There's always gonna be An uphill battle And sometimes I'm gonna have to lose Ain't about how fast I get there It ain't about what's waiting On the other side It's the climb Ooh, yeah Just keep on moving, keep climbing Keep the faith, baby - It's all about the climb - It's all about, all about the climb Keep your faith Oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah Whoa, whoa River, it was a time in my life where I was going through just a lot emotionally and personally. And then I had a dance party with my friends. The rule was that every girl had to bring their gay best friend, or no entrance. That was your pass. That was how you entered. And we were listening to Diana Ross, Whitney, Lindsay Lohan, Paris, Britney. You know, all the legends. We had little... We had boys in crop tops, little shorts, little high heels. We had, like, bundles and bundles. The hair was like everyone was Rapunzel. And it was just... It was so inspiring. Again, I guess, all of my songs kind of evolve. They could start as something that was a trouble. Like it just feels like it's an April shower. It never stops raining, and then it started raining down like love. River. Sometimes we just need a dance-floor banger. AKA, they don't want me to talk about how the fact the song is about [bleep] It's [bleep] nasty. It's nasty. I got a new dress To meet you downtown Can you walk me through the park To show it off? I can pull my hair back In the tight way that you like If you wrap me in your arms And never stop Heart beats so loud That it's drowning me out Living in an April shower You're pouring down Baby, drown me out Ooh, ooh, ooh You're just like a river Ooh, ooh, ooh You're just like a river Ooh, ooh, ooh You go on forever Ah, just like a river Blowing bubbles in the bath I can't stop from thinking lately You could be the one Have the honor of my babies Hope they have your eyes And that crooked smile Was a desert fore I met you I was in a drought Heart beats so loud That it's drowning me out Living in an April shower You're pouring down Baby, drown me out Ooh, ooh, ooh You're just like a river Ooh, ooh, ooh You're just like a river Ooh, ooh, ooh You go on forever Ah, you're just like a river You're never running dry Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah Feel you everywhere Face is all in my hair Covered up in your sweat Turns me on that you care, baby Your love, it flows just like a river - You're just like a river - That's what you are - You go on forever - That's what you are Ah, you're just like a river You're just like a river Heart beats so loud - That it's drowning me out - You're just like a river - Living in an April shower - You go on forever Pouring down - Baby, drown me out - Just like a river Highlighting negativity is pretty constant. We wake up with devastating news and sadness and hurt and pain. All of that is very real and should never be ignored, but we also can't erase that, at the same time, there is joy, there's growth, there's connection. I'm so fortunate to be physically and mentally well, and so I think that needs to be honored and celebrated. Self-love is, um, a conversation that's really amazingly kinda current. I think all of us are waking up to, you know, what Mama Ru's been saying for a long time now. "That if you can't love yourself, "how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else? "Can I get a amen?" The demo of Flowers is pretty different from what ended up being released to the world as this, like, celebratory song. It actually is more melancholy. Really when you strip away all the sounds and all the big harmonies, there's a lot of sadness to it. Um, but I've always... I've liked the idea of "fake it till you make it." And on the first chorus, I'm kind of telling myself, and I'm trying to convince myself. And by the third chorus, you can hear that there's a confidence that I finally believe it. And I think you can hear that a lot in the demo because everything is just stripped away, so you can really hear the kind of evolution of that song. - Okay. Miley, good? - Yep. Thank you. Ready. We were good We were gold Kind of dream that can't be sold We were right till we weren't Built a home and watched it burn I didn't want to leave you I didn't want to lie Started to cry and then remembered I I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours Say things you don't understand I can take myself dancing, yeah I can hold my own hand Yeah, I can love me Better than you can Can love me better I can love me better, baby Can love me better I can love me better, baby Paint my nails cherry red Match the roses that you left No remorse, no regrets I forgive every word you said I didn't want to leave you I didn't want to lie Started to cry, but then remembered I I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours Ah, ah, say things You don't understand I can take myself dancing, yeah I can hold my own hand Yeah, I can love me Better than you can Can love me better I can love me better, baby Can love me better I can love me better, baby Can love me better Ooh, ah I didn't want to leave you I didn't want to fight Started to cry, remembered I I can buy myself flowers Ah, ah Write my name in the sand Ah, ah, ah, ah Talk to myself for hours Ah, ah, say things You don't understand No, you never will I can take myself dancing, yeah I can hold my own hand Yeah, I can love me better than Yeah, I can love me better than You can I can love me better, baby Ah, ah I can love me better, baby Than you can - I can love me better, baby - Oh, oh Can love me better, I...
