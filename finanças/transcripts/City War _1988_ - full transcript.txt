You all must have worked hard. Have you received the money I sent you? Of course. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. The foundation of our new house back home has been laid. You must have heard of the inflation going in China. Our money isn't enough. When do we get the other half? Don't worry. Money is not a problem. As long as you get me what I want. We have never failed. Remember him, buddy! It's not me! You'll be in deep shit if you get me instead. Be sure to pay attention! Don't get the wrong guy. How's it going to be, darling? Shall I do it or do I leave it to you? I'll do it. I'll show my skills. Listen, in case somebody is around, it's better to use my gun. Here, try it. It's just the same. No problem. Enough with the ointment, she's about to take a shot. -Out of the way! -Please get out of the way! -Go away, idiot! -Make way! Please get in line! Shut up! Dad, they're cutting in line. I wonder which school they go to. Don't do that. Please don't make it hard for me. That's already the total of the bill. What did you just say? Add up my bill! -Be quick about it! -It's 106 dollars. -What, 106 dollars? -It's 106 dollars? -I only have a few tens. -That's right! -Are you kidding me? -Why didn't you say it? Hey! Are you done fooling around? Hey, idiot! Mind your own business! What did you just say? You think you're so mighty? The last time a bulky idiot provoked me, I hit him with my chest and he nearly died. -Good! Great! -Thank you! You're too kind with your words! Leave them be. Come on and hit me if you dare! Come on, beat her up! Idiot! -Hey, what's up? -Nothing! You shouldn't have come shopping without money. -Let's just leave! -Wait, you haven't paid for the comb! -Here, take it back! -You take the children home first. -Don't do it. -I'll be fine. Don't worry. Dad! Don't fool around. Freeze! What do you want, old man? -CID. -CID? You think you're all that? It's none of your business! You there! What? -You trying to scare me? -Both of you are shoplifting. Shoplifting? Why don't you come and frisk me then! Run! Stop right there, you two! This way! Stop running away! Hurry! Stop! You're still running away!? What are you doing? -Let me go! -Let her go! -Run, Damien! -You hold still! Run! Stop! Hurry up, Damien! Run! Kerosene Ken! Hey, Ting, good timing. What a coincidence. Watch over this door for me, don't let the kid slip away. -What's wrong? Need help? -It's fine, not a big deal. Don't come any closer! -Or I'll kill her! -Don't do anything rash! Calm down! Get away! -Get away! -Kid! Trying to hold a hostage, are you? Get the crisis negotiator from the headquarters right away. Ken, don't go doing anything crazy, times have changed. It's all about procedures now. Procedures? This punk doesn't care about rules. We've got to lock him up! Stop blabbering or I'll really kill her! Calm down, Ken. Ting, I know what I'm doing. Don't get in my way! Get back, there's nothing to see here. Step back! Inspector, what's with the ruckus? That kid is holding a pregnant woman hostage. -That's terrible. -Hey, is that him? Please help, excuse me... Please cooperate with us. -Hey, you go and take guard. -Okay! Chiu Lee. Ho Ka Ting, from the Patrol Division of Kowloon Headquarters. Sorry, I'm late. Is anyone hurt? Thankfully, none. The kid had been shoplifting and now he's holding a pregnant woman hostage. -Who's making all that fuss in there? -It's Chow Ken! -Kerosene Ken? -It's him all right. This is giving me a headache! Damn, kid. Are you going to let her go or what? -You're pissing me off! -Go away! Put down the knife! Put it down now! Don't come any closer! Or else I'll kill her! -Please help me! -Don't do anything rash! Hey buddy, calm down! Just calm down. Ken, are you trying to scare him to death? Stop crying! Are you crazy? He's just a kid! He's going to wet himself. That damn kid is very arrogant. Give me ten minutes, if it's not settled, I'll leave. Don't get in my way now. Why don't you do it then? Since you're a smartass. Silly. All you did was steal some stuff. Why go and cause such a big fuss? It's just a small problem. -You want some water? -No! Don't do anything rash. If you hurt this lady, she might suffer from a miscarriage, and you'll be charged for manslaughter. Wouldn't that be a shame for you? How old are you? I was born in 1973, but I don't know how old I am. See? You're not even 16 yet. -Do you have any criminal records? -No! That's even more of a shame then. I'll be honest, I'm here to help you. I can talk to the judge. Shoplifting is a minor crime. We can talk this through. At most, you'll be in probation for a year. What are you singing, big mouth? You idiot! If I wanted to sing, why would I sing to you? -I'm going to sue that bastard! -Calm down, buddy! He chased and hit my girlfriend! And almost got me run over by a car. So what if you're a cop? -You cops think you can beat anyone up? -What? Damn kid! Are you threatening us? -You want to sue me? -Take it easy! You want to sue me? Fine. Go ahead, you bastard! -Ken! Don't do it! -Eat my bullet! -Put down the gun please! -Don't stop me! I'll really kill her! Let's see which is faster, your knife or my gun. -I'll kill her! -Calm down! Give me the gun. Don't do anything rash! Ken! I'm begging you, just keep calm! What good will it do for you to kill the kid? You've been a police officer longer than me, and I'm at a higher rank than you but I'm begging you! -Please give me the gun. -Let go! Don't shoot! Please! Sir, I won't do it again. -You damn kid! -I'm sorry! Sir, please let me go. Get up, you twat! Sir, you told me that you'd help me. Joke is on you. You nearly ruined my career. You'll be sorry when we get back to the station. Being a police officer is all about brawn and brains. Don't you know about that? I thought you were braver than that. Damn you! I almost got killed. I'll grind you to death! A glass of chilled champagne Secretly pours the night Into my heart A quick hello Gently brings tonight Into my eyes A glass of chilled champagne Secretly pours comfort Into my heart A quick see you Lightly shows me The night's problems Is love a debt? Or is it destiny? Do people meet like crossing lines? Destined to meet one another You want to do it? Destined to separate And remain apart forever? Tonight is destiny Does emotion keep changing Just like destiny? Changing to the future Let me break through The barrier of tender love A glass of chilled champagne Secretly pours the night Into my heart A quick hello Gently brings tonight Into my eyes A glass of chilled champagne Secretly pours comfort... Chiu, I haven't seen you for a whole week now. Don't throw your chances away. -Who is she? -No idea. She's been hanging around here for several weeks. -Amazing! -Incredible! May I? May I? I failed... I'm Chiu. I don't care who you are, it's none of my business. But I am looking at you right now. That makes it your business. Is that how you pick up girls? So what's your name? Black Widow. That's scary. And I'm Preacher. What are you talking about? Do you want to hear the rest? -Bye. -Wait. Hey. This meal is on you right? Whatever you say, Chiu. A glass of cold bubbles. Those lyrics are quite funny. They are silly and depressing. Chilled, brief, bubbles... Things you can't touch... Hey, Black Widow. What advice do you have, Preacher? Shall we find a place to carry on? Let's rush for those bubbles. You mean sex? Oh come on, be more direct. Since you're so desperate, why don't we just do it here? Are you used to giving floor shows? You like performing in public, don't you? Absolutely. I don't care what people think of me. I've already said yes. The rest is your call to make. But I've never done this before. There is a first time for everything. You think I'm that kind of guy? I didn't think you were so old school. Don't be angry. I wasn't toying with you on purpose. I really am busy tonight. Goodbye. Here comes Chatty, I'll get the door. -Chatty. -What took you so long? Long time no see. Show me some moves. -Crane, dragon, crane... -Snake, dog, pig... -I peck, peck... -Leopard, horse, cow, pig, leopard... -Chiu, you've come. -Hey sister. Take a seat, I'll prepare some food. What's with this basket of fruits, are we expecting someone? I'll tell you something, they've set you up on a date. What? Another one? Chatty, you're done for this time. -This one's horrible. -Horrible? -Hey, Ken. -Oh, you're here. What's your wife up to? It's nothing. She means well. Just pretend that it's a nightclub. If it works out, chat a little bit more. If it doesn't, simply forget about it. Doesn't that make your wife the mother? Does she look like one? If she's the mother, then you're the father. Are you out of your mind? Cheer up, kid. It's matchmaking day! -Cheer up! -Yes, sir! -That's right! -Yes, I know! Wow! Food! Chiu, this is Aunt Sum. She just came back from Canada with her daughter. How are you? I'm great, what about you? Not bad. Honey! I'll go get her. Come over here, Teresa. Look, he's much better looking than on the photo, get over there. Mr. Lee, have you been to Canada before? -Mommy. -Chiu. This is Ms. Teresa Yu. -This is Chiu Lee. -Hello, Dick Lee. Hi. Aunt Sum. Hey. Excuse me. -Hey. -What's the matter? It's like picking a fish from the market. Are you saying that I have bad taste? No... Honey, you better behave this time. -Be good. -Okay. She's a rare catch, don't you want her? Of course I do, even if she is a tiger mixed with a leopard. But please don't do it again. Entertain Ms. Yu on my behalf, okay? -Come over here for a second. -Okay. Remember what I said. Come help me in the kitchen. Hey! How's the scenery in Canada? Not bad, it's just a little bit cold. Don't worry! You can just exercise to keep warm. Where do you hang out usually? Nowhere. I usually just stay home and read when I'm free, and listen to classical music. Or take a walk along the beach during the sunset with my darling. Darling? My darling is a Chihuahua. It's no match for you, you're so elegant and gentle. What a rare gem. You're too kind. Not at all. Being a police officer, I gambled more than I studied. Profanity comes to me naturally like singing. It was all about having fun, who cares about school grades. I've seen more rascals than gentlemen. When I was free, I'd woo some girls. Race some cars, beat some people up, smoke some weed. The gist of it is, we police are gangsters with badges. Cheers, have a drink! Don't be shy! Have a drink! I nearly forgot to tell you something. I have always dreamt of marrying a rich old dame. That way, I wouldn't have to work. What's the matter? A worthy contender! You should have said so earlier. Then I wouldn't have to put on a ladylike facade. What are you holding the glasses for? There's no fun drinking alone. -Let's play some drinking games. -Come on! Fortune! Four spaces! Six sixes, eight eights. -Eight eights, nine nines, open, open... -Eight eights, nine nines, open, open... -Six sixes, eight eights, nine nines... -Six sixes, eight eights, nine nines... Seven! Miss, drink up! That was amazing! Amazing, right Chiu? Listen up. Look, it's obvious that you've met the right girl. I have three supermarkets, two restaurants, and a bakery. Money isn't a problem. But I'm not a rich old dame. We're all just looking for fun. Money isn't a matter. As long as these dirty men can make me happy. Great! You've got style. Hey, I can't play by myself, let's play again. Again? Fortune! Four fours! Six sixes, nine nines. Three forks, four fours, eight eights, six sixes... Six sixes... You rascal. I told you to behave. Every time you're drunk, you lose all sense of yourself. You're going to pay when we get home. What is the matter, Aunt Sum? Six six, open up! Chatty, I told you she was horrible. -Dragon! -Snake! Did you call the police? Yes sir, that car's been parked here for a few days. There's blood seeping out from it. It reeks. Yes. I wonder if there's a body inside the boot. Right, I'm going to get a statement from you. You might have to testify in the future. Sure thing. A SPOKESMAN FROM THE FORCE CONFIRMED THAT THE DEAD BODY FOUND IN TSUEN WAN CARPARK IS POLICE OFFICER HO KA TING THE POLICE HAS SET UP A PARTICULAR UNIT FOR THE INVESTIGATION TRAILS OF THE MURDERER HAVE BEEN DETECTED It should have been expected. It's just that nobody saw it coming. He didn't deserve that! Why are you shouting? I'm sorry! I know you've been friends with Ting for decades. But there's no point being so mad. He's already dead. Those bastards are becoming increasingly brutal while our police regulations keep getting stricter, turning us into a bunch of cowards. If only we could do it the old way, taking the initiative if anything happens, Ting wouldn't have ended up like this. What good would taking the initiative do? Whatever it is, times have changed. Why does it stink in here? What's the problem? It stinks. Next time, take the case. What happened Chun Nga? A big case? Gangsters are like Rambo nowadays. They have a dozen shots, but we only have six. We're just police, but our lives are at stake. That's why you should be like me. If you see gangsters, back off. If you see nice folks, do as you please. We only get a few thousand as wage. Why risk our lives? Damn it, what did you say? Chun Nga is a good policeman. He's hardworking. And you're here, blabbering. -What now? -Eat your words and say it again. -I don't want to talk with you. -What? -Hands off. -Eat your words and say it again. -What do you want? -Let's calm down. Get a hold of yourself first. -Look at yourself. -Sit down first! -You want to get beaten up? -Attention! What idiot speaks English and shouts "attention" in the changing room? You guys are trained police officers. You're not just a bunch of idiots. Even with all the investigating, you still don't have a clue! The killer is just a human being. He can't fly or go underground. You guys are not qualified for the job! Because you're all useless. You're all trash! Officer Wu, we're already giving it our all. Look at you. You look like a thief. You're a disgrace to the force. Sir, he can't be blamed for that. You should ask his dad instead. Go take a shower! Draw the curtains! You've got such a bad temper, you quarrel with your colleagues so often. I wonder how your wife tolerates your bad temper? Officer Wu. How my wife treats me is none of your business. I don't need to tell you that. But what I can say is, I was known as Curly Ken in school. Now, they call me Kerosene Ken. Ken! How dare you speak to your senior in that tone? Even if your superior mistreated you, you shouldn't call him out on it. You hear me? Do you hear me? I can't hear you! -Louder! -Yes, sir! Understood, sir! Sir, maybe it's the hot weather. It affected his temper. Please excuse him. Lee Chi Chiu, use your expertise in negotiation and talk to your friend. Chances don't come by every day. Carry on with your shower. Again? You must understand that Inspector Ho's death is a sign that gangsters are going against the police. Open the gate for him. Boss... -Boss! -Boss. Congratulations boss, you are finally free! Ted. Ted. Come on, get in the car. -Grandpa. -Get in first, we can talk later. Ted is out, we'll have a great time soon. Ted, now that you're out of jail, what do you plan to do? My plans? We'll see about that. Don't worry about it. I've done the planning for you. Hurry up and marry Penny, earn a living the proper way. To think of what happened ten years ago, the one regarding To Lau Chi's case, I'm thankful for your willingness to take the blame all by yourself. Hong Kong has changed a lot, we all have real jobs now. True, I've been sewing clothes in jail for ten years too. Sewing is a legitimate business, right? Grandpa, would you be interested in a tailoring business? I can help you out. Ted, you sure know how to joke around. Why would Uncle have an interest in a tailoring business? Boss. Here's some information for you, think of it as a souvenir. Thanks a lot, Bobby. This means a lot to me, thank you. Don't mention it. Ted, what are you doing? Come out. No! Please don't! Ted, please don't do it. Ted. No. No. I missed you a lot. Ted... I love you. I really do. Ted! -Ted! -Go away! Dammit! Ted, what's this about now? What are you doing? Did you sleep with other men? While I was in prison, did you mess around? My feelings for you... have never changed. Even if such a day would come... I'll tell you in person when you come out. Because... Because I promised I'd wait for you. I didn't want to betray you in any way. So you're saying you pity me, it's all out of sympathy. No! No matter what happens, we still have feelings for one other. Ted... Since we were young, I've loved you in the same way. I... Hello? Hello, who would you like to speak to? Say something. If you're not going to talk, then drop the prank call. Officer Chow. You're retiring soon, aren't you? Why do you still have such a bad temper? Your kids are still young. You should take care of your health. Who are you? Can't you recognize my voice? I'm Ted Yiu. Ted Yiu. That's right, I'm a nostalgic person. That's why I called you as soon as I got out of prison. Is your family well? Thank you, we are all well. Stop playing games! What do you want? How would I know what I want? I'm just calling to say hello. Save it, I've got nothing to do with you. Kid, let me tell you something. I knew this day would come. I'm not afraid of thugs like you. Are you really that bored? You plan on causing trouble, don't you? You better behave yourself. Don't let me catch you again. We'll see about that. Split up! Ted! Penny, leave with Grandpa first! -Ted! -Just go! Ted! Grandpa, just go! Cuff him! Don't move or I'll shoot. Freeze! What's the matter? Are you all right? Mommy. Don't do that, the kids are here. What are you ashamed of? -Daddy! -Daddy! Stop playing, it's time to eat. How are you? Is everything okay? Don't worry, I'm okay. Come on, let's have dinner. Fine. Let's have dinner. Time to eat. Does it smell nice? It does, your perfume smells nice. Where did you buy it? I bought it from France. -Thank you. -Thanks. Penny. The airplane is here. Which one? The one you dropped the bomb last time. The Prince Charming. Really? Where is he? He's right outside kissing your car's ass. What a coincidence. Penny, go easy on him. I'm scared you might go too far. If the boss finds out, you'll be in trouble. I trust you, see you later. Penny. I didn't know you were in a rush. Stop pretending. You've been waiting for me, right? Not really, I just happened to pass by. So you're saying you didn't mean it? I don't mean it? You mean, I'm not serious about pursuing you? Must I accept your pursuit? Am I not pursuing you now? I dropped the bomb on you previously because I didn't want you to be in trouble. I can handle it. My dad's the captain for the firemen. Is that so? Where would you like to go? Where would you like to take me to? Someplace where you can remember me by. Sure! Make way please! So you're into adventures? That's because I'm lonely. Then you've found the right person. The more thrilling it is, the better. You haven't told me why you're known as the Black Widow. I was naive when I was young. I got acquainted with the head of a triad. He cheated on me, and then abandoned me. I thought a lot about it. Went out every night and started calling myself the Black Widow. Don't worry, I can handle anything. If I meet that that guy of yours someday, I will avenge you. Thanks! We'll talk about it later. Preacher, let me tell you something. I've never been this happy before. Really? That makes us a good match then. Mr. Yiu is in that room. -I'll find him myself, thanks. -Welcome. Sorry, please carry on. What a coincidence, Officer Chow. You like going to the nightclubs too? Take a seat. Join us. Ted Yiu. You and I have something to talk about. Sure. Since you're here anyway, why don't you take a seat and have a drink? I can't take this drink. Let's toast in honor of my good pal, Inspector Ho Ka Ting instead! How rude! Don't worry, I'll clean it up for you. I can't believe he died before I got released. But it seemed that he had a short-lived life. Good thing you know about that. So why don't you stop pretending? Be quiet! It's none of your business. Officer Chow, this is a public place. Behave and don't forget your manners. Ted Yiu, listen to my words. First, you better enjoy your life while you still can. Inspector Ho won't let you off so easily. Second, you called me up at home. Do you think what you did was cool? Are you trying to seek revenge? Just try anything and you're in serious trouble! Third, I really regret not being the one to put a bullet in your head. My kindness resulted in this mess today. But this time, I won't let you go so easily. If you commit a crime, I'll put a bullet between your eyes. So you can't commit any more crimes. You better mark my words. Hey, you listen too! You charge me if I break the law. But if you have no evidence, get lost! If memory serves me right, your record isn't very good either. It won't do you any good if you play with fire. You better watch out in the days to come. Why are you still standing here? We don't need a penguin around. Are you intimidated by my boss? I suspect you're illegally armed. Take off your jacket, I'm going to frisk you. What now? Are you trying to frame me? Sir, you're clearly trying to frame us. What is this supposed to mean? Come out. I'll come out then. I'm not afraid of you. Put your hands in the air! Hold it right there! Go to hell! Freeze! Get lost! It's none of your business! Who was that guy? Hand him over to me. How would I know who he is? Don't do anything rash! Don't fool around or I'll shoot you. -Hold it! CID. -Get off! Ken, it's you! Stay away, this is personal. Sir, lock him up. He's drunk and he assaulted people. Bastard, do you think I won't pull the trigger? Go ahead! Shoot me! Ken, let's talk this through. Just hand me the gun first. Who was that guy? You'll get into trouble if you kill him. Don't give me a hard time. Give me the gun. Ted Yiu, I'm not going to let you go! -Chiu, good morning. -Good morning. There's no explanation for this. He's a police officer and he did such a thing! Explain yourselves! -Chiu. -What's the matter? Ken got into trouble last night at the nightclub. Officer Wu is still scolding him. -Are you kidding me? -It's true. Officer Wu, please listen to my explanation. Not a chance. Mr. Yiu, I'm very sorry. I apologize on behalf of the Police Force. It's all right. As long as you know who is at fault. As for this subordinate, we'll handle the matter internally. Sir, go easy on him. Just a warning will do. We're friends after all. We shouldn't bother Officer Chow for such a small matter. That wouldn't be nice. -Asshole, what are you talking about? -Hold it! If you go on like this, I'll charge you with blackmailing! Officer Wu. You can't do that. -I've already made up my mind. -This's a bit too much for him. Great! At least he'll think before acting from now on. He's about to retire. Do you know that? I'm in charge here. This has nothing to do with you. Where's your ClD Room? It's just right there. -Thanks. -You're welcome. How did you know I worked here? I don't, I'm just looking for a friend of mine. I'm well acquainted here. Who are you looking for? I'll help you. Chiu, I really have something urgent to attend to. I'll call you later. -Are you looking for Mr. Yiu? -No. Enough with the lies, I can tell. Chiu, please just let me pass through. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Officer Wu, I think that is all for now. I'll consult my lawyer about your subordinate. -Bye! -Save your breath, big shot! I'm not afraid of you! You bastard, you definitely have something going on. What a nice public relationship with the police. -He's a friend. -A friend? Fine, keep it up. What are you looking at? Do I look weird? Big Mouth Chiu. Hiding isn't a solution. Please just don't get in my way. Are you aware that you're under probation? You don't want to lose your pension and spend the rest of your life in prison, do you? I'm not the one who caused all of this. It's that bastard Ted Yiu who wouldn't let things go. I'm your brother. Why don't you just tell what really happened? You wouldn't believe me anyway. I don't want to get you into trouble. You better leave me alone. Hey! I love getting myself into trouble. I'll stand by you no matter how serious it is. A trouble shared is a trouble halved! So, tell me! About ten years ago... I was in anti-narcotics with Ho. And Ted Yiu was a drug trafficker. That night, Ho killed his brother, and shot him in his groin. Now that Ho is dead, I'm next on his list. Don't you understand? Nonsense. How is that even possible? When Ho died, he was still in prison. Just think about it. He could have gotten someone else to do it. Idiot! You and Ho were in the police force for 20 years. I don't believe the two of you only share one enemy. You don't even have the evidence to suspect him. And yet, you stirred up a big mess. Don't you think you're crazy for risking your life for him? We are in the special investigation team. If Wu finds out you've concealed so much, he won't let you off the hook so easily. It doesn't matter how he treats me. We can't let Ho die for nothing. I can't let Ted Yiu get away with it. I never meant that. If you have adequate evidence, you could still nail him. Evidence? What use is evidence? You're an idiot! Where are you going? Don't follow me, or we won't be buddies anymore! Listen to me, will you? Hey! Hello there! -Hurry and take the luggage in. -Yes, ma'am. -Cousin. -Hi, Peter, Judy. -You're back? -Yes. Long time no see, cousin. You look beautiful. You too! Hey, Peter, how have you been? How's life going for you right there? Sit down first, I'll get dressed. -Not bad, but it was cold. -Cousin, I bought this present for you. -Daddy, we'll go upstairs. -We'll go upstairs. Hurry up. -Grandpa. -We'll go upstairs in a while. -Hey. -Hi. Ted, let me introduce a friend to you. It's fine, we've met before. Ted, I'm going up to see my cousins. You can stay, we know each other anyway. Grandpa. Why didn't you tell me about this beforehand on the phone? You know about it, right? Some people make me sick just seeing them. Ted. Sir Lee, you have better ways to find me. Why didn't you just get a warrant? You policemen are used to it, aren't you? You shouldn't have bothered Grandpa. Mr. Yiu, please don't take this the wrong way. I haven't seen Kuen for a long time. I'm just here to visit him. Ted, let's sit down and talk. So you're not here to see me? I'm here to see you too. I know you and Ken had a misunderstanding. It's no misunderstanding, it's facts. Ted! Be it a misunderstanding or the truth, Mr. Lee hopes that you agree to meet Ken. Let's all just talk things through. Regardless of the grudges you hold for one another, it can be resolved. Sure. Tell him to kneel before me and pour me a cup of tea, and greet me as his brother. You might as well make him kneel on broken glass. He definitely won't do it. Then you can call him a coward, that he doesn't qualify as your little brother, then you'd have your way. This is the first time I'm seeing someone beg with arrogance! You're wrong! I'm not here to beg you, I'm here to talk it out. I'm just here to tell you that If you stir it up, it would do us any good. Why did you come here if you're not afraid of losing? You're wrong again, I'm not afraid of losing. I'm just trying to save my energy to track down the murderer who killed Ho. Officer Lee, those are two separate matters. You're right, Kuen. Mr. Yiu. I know this isn't the way for me to approach you. But for my brother, I had to do this. The fact that I'm here proves my sincerity. I'm only asking that you show some sincerity too. Sincerity? Sincerity my ass. Ted. Excuse me, Mr. Lee. Ted. Come with me. Come here. Just leave, don't pursue this any further. Ted will put you to death. Thanks for caring. Coming here, I expected as much. Ted Yiu isn't the only one who fooled me. I didn't mean to lie to you. I had no idea this was all mixed up. Don't take it seriously. I was just fooling around. You have a complicated background. What are you implying? When we first started out, we did this on our own free will. Nobody forced anybody into doing anything. All right, it's all settled now. Ted's temper is quite bad. You guys talk this through. Grandpa is right. I've been in prison for so many years. It's about time I enjoy my life. How about I let the matter go? That's sincere enough, right? I'm glad you are sincere, Mr. Yiu. But I'll have to choose a day first. No problem. Kuen, I'll wait for the news from you. Penny, see Officer Lee to the door. It's all right. I'll show myself out to the door. Goodbye. -Nothing to see. -Let's go. Officer, see you later. He drives such a prestigious car, yet he can't even pay for the rent. It's a trend now, it's more thrilling to do it this way. Wait for me in the car, I'll be right back. Hurry up. Quickly. Comrades. Come up, hurry up. Quick. Hurry up. This way. Get in the car, quickly. Come. Hey comrades. Take a good look at this place, here. You see the billboard of Sake House? Your targets live on the third floor. Take a look. There's a roof at the top. Pay attention to the surroundings. There are lots of cars and people around. The police comes around every fifteen minutes. The front door is just behind that alleyway. -It's usually open, have a look. -Bobby. Fellow comrades, enjoy yourselves while you're in Hong Kong. Whatever you buy, the bill is on me. But I want it done fast and clean. Failure is not an option. -You all heard that, right? -Ted. -Did you get it? -I have something to talk to you about. Let's take a second look. What's the matter? Ted, why didn't you keep to your promise? You promised Uncle that you'd talk to Ken. I can't find a good time, so I'm going to forget about it. It's what I wanted anyway. Penny, I need your help with this. Help me bring them over. -No. -Hey. If I don't do this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. The fact that he ruined me, means he ruined you too. Help me, Penny. -Listen to me. -I won't do it. -I can't do it. -Help me just this once. Hey, just a minute. Is there a problem? It's nothing. -Leave it to me. -I can do it, let me do it. -Don't touch it. -Give it to me. Dad, it must be Chatty. I'll get the door. You go back to our room, I'll get the door. Mom, is dinner ready? I'm hungry! Hey, hurry up and open the door! It's heavy. -It's heavy. -What is it? You're wasting money again. I'm warning you now. There's a lot to eat tonight. Eat and mind your words. My wife knows nothing. Do I look like a nosy person? -Hey! -Chiu, you're here! -Wow! It smells really good! -You think so? -Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! -Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! Siu Wah! It's beautiful! The horse is for you, the butterfly is for your sister. Thank you, Chatty. Sis, this is for you. You shouldn't have done that. -You buy me a present every year. -Take a look! Open it! You're wasting your money on us. -Well? Do you like it? -It's beautiful. You've got great fashion sense. He always comes here to eat our food, it's his guilty conscience talking. -How could you say that? -How could you bad-mouth me? Let us go out. Have a seat. Consider it a favor from me, go talk to him okay? It's not that I'm being difficult. It's a matter of principle. A police and a criminal can't be friends. How could I be on the same side with him? What's wrong with having a cup of tea? You got yourself into this. You deal with it yourself. Let's eat, and not talk about this. Ted Yiu still has the right to charge you. Are you aware that he can charge you? I'm not afraid of Ted Yiu. He's not even human. If you're afraid of him and you believe him, you're an idiot. Let's just eat. PENNY IS WAITING AT THE CROSSROAD BETWEEN BOUNDARY STREET AND CUMBERLAND ROAD URGENT, COME RIGHT NOW URGENT, BE HERE QUICK Who was that? It's nothing, I'll be right back. -Dinner is ready, aren't you going to eat? -You go ahead first, I'll be right back. -Be quick about it. -Let me do it. Where is he going? Dinner is about to start. -Hey. What are you doing? -Just get in the car first. Stop the car, what are you doing? -I have a lot to tell you. -Can it! Chiu! I've never been this serious. Penny, stop fooling around. I'm waiting for news on Ted Yiu. If he finds out about this, you'll be in trouble too. I don't want to enrage him, don't you get it? Don't go, please stay a little longer! -Enough, I have a dinner to go to! -You can't go! Don't go! Chiu, I'm begging you, please. Give me ten minutes. After ten minutes has passed, everything will be fine. I'm begging you, please don't go. Promise me. -Just let me go first. -Promise me. Let me go! Start the car! Give me the key! Don't make me do it, I won't give it to you! -Give me the keys! -No! Give it to me! I don't want you to get killed! Chiu! My feelings for you are for real, don't you understand? What are you talking about? Chiu! Chiu, you can't go! Listen to me, Chiu! Chiu! Let go of me, Ted! You bitch! Chatty! Chatty! Daddy, Mommy! What's wrong? Mommy! Daddy! -You two get out of here. -Mommy! How dare you hurt my husband, I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Go! Just run! What's happening? -What's going on? It's so noisy up there. -Call the police! Get out of the way! Out of the way, move aside! Ken! Run, just run! We're not leaving! Hurry and run! Mommy! Fan! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! My sister! Fan! You asshole! Let me go! I'll kill you! Help me! -Put the kid down! -No! Help me! Put him down! -No! -Listen! Stop right there! Stay away! Let him go! If you let the kid go, I'll promise you anything! Just tell me what you want! -Daddy! -Siu Wah! -Don't be afraid! -Ken! If anything happens to my kid, I won't let you go! Listen, I can let go of your kid. But you have to kill him! Chiu, shoot him! I know you never miss. Chiu, Siu Wah's life is in your hands. I know I'm very accurate. I know I can kill him with one shot. But if I kill him, all links to Ted Yiu will be gone! Damn it! You're still thinking of Ted Yiu at a time like this? Chiu, if Siu Wah dies, my whole family will be gone! Just take the shot! What are you waiting for? Shoot! Shoot! Hurry! Shoot him! Siu Wah! Daddy! Wah! Siu Wah! Call an ambulance! Hurry and call the ambulance! Siu Wah! Siu Wah! Look at what you've done to Siu Wah. -Siu Wah! -Look at your godson. I told you to take the shot! Why didn't you do it? We're no longer friends from this day on. Just get lost! Hurry! There are bodies up there. This way please. Please be careful. I won't leave. I'll pick up from where I left off. Ted, haven't you spent enough time in prison? Are you waiting for the police to come get you? You almost killed Ken's entire family. You've already had your revenge. For Penny's sake, I hope you'll leave. For her sake? That's not even worth it. Ted! She has Chiu now. Why would she still care about me? Besides, I never forced you to stay. You were the one crying and waiting for me to get out of jail. I might be impotent, but I'm certainly not blind. You were cheating on me behind my back! Please watch your words. We might be engaged, but we haven't officially married. I have a right to have friends. And, in every way, I've been really good to you already. Ten years. Ten years isn't a short period of time. Any other girl would have changed long ago! Only I would wait for someone like you. What do you expect me to do? I'm a woman. I have emotions too. I have my needs! You're honest. Why don't you just tell me that you like that cop. Yes, I have feelings for him! -What? -Ted! You've gone too far! How could you do that in front of me! Grandpa, I remember the chances that you've given me in the past. I may be able to overlook many things, but I have my limits too. You never learn. Go back and think it through. That's not necessary. Grandpa, you should go back to your prayers. No one tells me what to do. If someone attempts to stop me, they will have consequences to bear. Siu Wah. -Doctor! -He's still in critical condition. Don't worry, we'll look after him. Let's head in. Ken! Ken. That bastard is inhumane. We won't let your wife's death be in vain. Don't worry. We'll avenge her. That's right, Ken! If I see that Ted, I promise I'll kill him. -Officer Wu. -Officer Wu. What's the matter? Are you guys slacking off and having a party? -Officer Wu. -Officer Wu. I can only express my sorry about your loss. If only you had shared the information, it wouldn't lead to your family's loss. You brought this upon yourself. Let me remind you. You'll have to cooperate with the police, that is to cooperate with me. Don't push me. I'm still a policeman. That's right, as of now, I'm ordering you to lure Ted Yiu out. Dream on, I won't help you on your promotion. You are hopeless. Without you, I can still find Ted Yiu. Getting promoted is the least of my concerns. -You idiot. -What did you say? I said you're inhuman. Ken wanted me to help him. He said Ted Yiu killed his whole family. He wants revenge. Officer Lee, you're buddies with him, you should help him. Just pretend that you weren't involved in any of this. I swear on my words, sir. I don't gain a thing from all of this. What's with the generosity? You just want me to kill him, don't you? So what if I did? I've wanted to kill him for a long time anyway. Why is that? Do you have a grudge against him? He played me for a fool. He promised to deal with me. But later on, he went to the foreigners and left me with these. Where's the trade happening? I heard it's at the bus workshop. Officer Lee, please don't take it all. Open it up! Officer Lee, you can't do this to him. Ken needs these guns badly. Officer Lee, please leave a few here. Otherwise, I won't be able to explain myself when Chow Ken arrives. Chiu! It's you again? Haven't you caused enough damage? Whether I die on the streets or not is my concern. Leave my guns be. I will handle this myself. Don't get yourself into unnecessary trouble. I can't let that. Chiu, this isn't a game! I'm not playing a game. I'm risking my life for it. Your son needs you now. So you can't go. I visited Siu Wah. He still calls me godfather. Give me back my guns! Chiu! Go back inside. I owe it to you, Chiu. If not for you, I wouldn't have found Chow Ken. But the fact that you're trading guns, you'll be sentenced to prison for eight to ten years. Put the guns down. Chow Ken, I'm giving you another chance. If you cooperate with me, I'll close an eye to this. But you have to tell me where Ted is. Chiu, get in the car! What are you doing? Boss, this looks serious, what should we do? I'll write a report... Serves you right! Get in the car. I'll get it! Open the gates. Get in. You first. Hey, Chiu, what are you doing? Hey, Chiu! Chiu! Chiu, we're brothers. Let me go! You can't do this, Chiu! A friend in need is a friend indeed. This is no joke. Chiu, don't go alone. Chiu! Of course. You're good. Using spare parts to smuggle guns. Spread out! He's under the bus! Go away! Boss, he's under the bus. He's under the bus! -Ted, hurry and go! -Shut up! He's under the bus! -Ted! -Shut up! -Get lost! It's none of your business! -Chiu! Don't! Move aside! It's none of your business, go away! I'm not leaving. Chiu, please let Ted go! -I'm begging you! -Get lost! Don't do it! Don't shoot! Just get lost, ifs none of your business! Penny! Penny! Penny... -Boss, let me help you. -Get lost. Chiu! Chiu. I told you to stay away. Why did you have to do this? Promise me, Ken. Kill Ted for me. Don't worry, I won't let that bastard Ted Yiu go! Hang in there, I'll be back soon. You must not resign to death! Get ahold of yourself! Ted Yiu! I told you that you would die. Bobby! Just shoot. Hurry up. Shoot! Chiu. How are you holding up? Hang in there, Chiu! Chiu! Please hang in there, get up!
