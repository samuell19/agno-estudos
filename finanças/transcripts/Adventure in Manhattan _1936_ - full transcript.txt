Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. What kind of a story do you call this? - Who wrote it? - Dolan. Oh, Dolan, eh? Well, that's fine. That's fine... - File it! - But... The greatest ruby in the world is stolen... and all you fellows can do is stand there. Get me a story, a feature. Involve a woman in it. But chief, there's no woman in the case. Oh, no woman in it, uh? The Koor-Hal ruby is stolen and you stand there... and tell me there's no woman in it? There's got to be a woman in it. - Got to be... - Where's your human interest? You romance? Your love? Oh, what's the point of talking to you? Get me that crime expert I sent for. He'll find me a woman. He'll find me a dozen women. - He said he's be here at 10 o'clock. - What time is it now? He's late. Doesn't he know that an appointment with me is almost sacred? If I remember right, nothing is sacred for Melville. Oh, is that so? Well, he'll have to be trained, see? If I remember right, he don't train easy. Uh-huh... you get out. When Melville comes, shoot him in. If I remember right, he'll shoot himself in. What can I do for you, sir? Tell the managing editor George Melville's here. - Where? - You're looking at him. The great Melville in person? Who am I to disagree with you? This way, champ. Gangway, gents. This is George Melville. - Hiya, slinks! - Hello, George! How's the criminologist? What brings you down to these parts, my lad? Well, just a little thing they needed a good writer for. Funny, I felt that. Say, George, I read your last crime story, that is, I hope it's your last. Encephalic. Pure encephalic. You want to watch your private license, Mac. Lead on, McDuff. Who? No, no, tell him I'm dead. Wait. I'm not in to him. Hello? No, no, throw that tramp in the sewer. - Well, what do you want? - What do you want? Wait, don't tell me. You're Melville. - Right. - Yes. What time is it? You're late. People who work for me keep their appointments on time. Well, it's a very nice rule, but I don't happen to be working for you yet. I say, you're quite a crime writer, aren't you? - Not bad. - Yeah! You got hundreds of people reading these silly stories too, haven't you? Thousands. What do you think you know about this ruby mystery? - You'd be surprised. - I want to be surprised! My readers want to be surprised. The columns of this paper are wide open... to any young fool can make an ass of himself entertainingly. - Thank you. - Now, all I want is circulation. If you can involve a woman in this case and a haunted castle... I'm sorry, I can't give you a woman or a castle. The best I can do is an international crook 45 of years of age. - Suave, educated, visionary and crazy. - Crazy? Crazy, obsessed over beauty. Say, you're not kidding, are you? - You really know something about this? - Sure. All right, come on, come on, out with it. What do you know? That's what I'm to be paid for. - Oh. $50 a story. - $75. All right, all right, 75. But I want a copy. If you can put your finger on this crazy murderer... Wait a minute, wait a minute, I didn't say I could catch him. I thought you knew where he was. Well, sure, but he's supposed to have been dead for four years. Dead? Uh-uh, I won't have it. Look here, you go outside there and get yourself a typewriter and go to work. - Here. - Huh? Sir, please, here is your sandwich and your beer. - Hiya, boys. - Hi, George. - Hello, Otto! - Hello, Mr. Melville! I see by the papers that you are knocking them for a loop. All in a day's work, Otto. How about a cheese sandwich and a glass of beer? Before, I was in the back room and I was just reading your article... and I was telling them that if they studied real hard... they might get to be smart fellows like you. - I'll bet that made a hit. Thanks, Otto. - You are welcome, your honor. - A man of sound judgment. - I thank you very much. And he gets money for acting like a lunatic in public. Nobody but a loose-brained idiot... would break out all over the front page with a prediction like that. Did it ever occur to you boys that he might get lucky again... and be right about this Berlea crook? Yeah. well, if that happens, I'm leaving town. I couldn't stand it. - Hello, pals! - Uh... well, hello, George! - We were just talking about you. - Were you? - Hello, George. - Hello, Mark. How's the playwright? I don't know. I think there's a leakage of the lupito. I see you've had a play in rehearsal for about three months. - When's it coming off? - Oh, any month now. What's the delay? It's the producer. Keeps remodeling the theater. Spending a fortune. And all I do is rewrite and rewrite. Too bad that George didn't see your script before you started. You know, he might have given you some good suggestions. Yeah, too bad. Well, boys, how'd you like to take a little trimming in a game of pool? I'll spot you 15 points. Okay, you're just the guy we'd like to take. All right. Just for that I'll spot you 20 points. Ten cents a point. - This gets interesting. - Come on in, baby, come on in. Oh, boy, rack 'em up. Hop in. - Your break. - You boys don't look right. Well, I'll take it easy to start with. 15 ball in the corner. Well, now I'll make a soft one for you. Bank the nine. - Know where to call your shots, don't you? - Never miss. You don't think you're gonna miss on this show you're running for the paper? About Berlea? I wouldn't kid my best friends, would I? I'll tell you this. When I write that Andr? Berlea is still living... I'm writing facts. Oh, come on, George, the police said he was killed in Viena. Do they? Do they also say who stole that Stadivarius in Rome in 1933? And the three Cellinis from the Arch Duke of Bliarhaven in 1934, long after Berlea was supposed to be dead? - It could have been anybody. - No, you're wrong. Berlea's right here in America. It's only just started. Remember, Berlea's no ordinary type of crook. He's a rich man who steals because of a passion. The love of art treasures. Nothing he ever touched was for sale. So... Well, so right now he's the possessor of the Koor-Hal ruby. Five-ball in that corner. Good shot. You ought to stick to pool and let the police have crimes. You think so? What would you say if I told you the next sensational robbery... was going to be the Sunburst diamond? Oh, lay off, George. The Sunburst diamond is in the vaults of the Commercial National Bank. - Everybody knows that. - You're right. Everybody does know it, including Berlea. It's one of the most valuable collectors' items in the country. And Berlea won't rest until he gets it. - You're crazy. - All right, I'm crazy. I'll tell you something else. Within 24 hours there's going to be another sensational murder... in connection with the theft of the Koor-Hal ruby. - There'll be a what? - Another murder. The owner's butler. According to reports, he got a look at Berlea. Berlea doesn't like that one bit. Uh, tell us, master. How do you arrive at these marvelous conclusions? Well, I'll tell you. It's very simple. Merely add up the facts in any case, think clearly, and keep your motives straight. You know, I saw a motive once. But I took an aspirin and it went away. Of course, not everyone can do it. You have to be built right. Take ordinary men like yourselves. Now, you couldn't add up facts correctly... because you'd let impulse and sentiment get in the way. Whereas, on the other hand, take a superior type of person, like myself. - Old Stony Heart the first. - Stony Heart with a clear eye. Now, take this simple illustration. One you boys can understand. Take a case involving a beautiful woman. Now, you'd fail, because you'd see a beautiful woman. Whereas I would succeed... because my criminologist eye would see her as no more than a possible clue. Boy, you should've seen the clue I was out with last night. Mr. Melville, Mr. Melville! Mr. Bane just called, said for you to run over to the Gazette right away. - Somebody has been murdered. - Murdered? Who? I couldn't catch the name, somebody's butler. Well, as long as this is the last shot, I might as well make it a tough one. Put your cue down, will you? Just terrific. Well, Mark, I'll look in on your rehearsals. I can undoubtedly be of some assistance. Gentlemen. How do those balls jump the cue? How can you live with a guy like that? Boys, we have reached a crisis. Will you help me, please? Can you help me, please? Will you help me, please? I'm desperate. I must have help. Goodness gracious. Who is she? Taxi! - Follow that cab. Hurry it up. - Yes, sir. - Yes, ma'am? - A facial and a shampoo, please. Miss Arnold. - Facial and shampoo. - This way, please. - Taxi? - Yes, please. Taxi. Spent it all? - Well? - What are you going to do? Get in there. - Where to? - Driver, go through the park, please. Yes, ma'am. You managed to become quite attractive on my money. How did you steal it? Oh, I don't know, I didn't mean to, I... - I followed you in the crowd... - Uh-huh? You'd better not cry. You'll ruin that expensive makeup. Oh, listen to me, please. I've never stolen anything in my life before. Tonight I had to because... I've waited three years for tonight. - What? - Oh, it's so difficult to explain. Would you... could you trust me for just... just a few hours? I suppose that's an awful lot to ask of a man you've just robbed. Well, I suppose it's a great deal to ask you but, uh... Could you tell me what you want those three hours for? At 8 o'clock I want to see someone. Oh, I see. And I'm supposed to wait on some street corner... for you to come back and give yourself up. Oh, no, no, if you don't believe me, you can come with me. That would spoil your game, wouldn't it? There isn't any game. Come with me, will you, please? - Till 8 o'clock? - Yes. All right, I'll give you a couple of hours. Thank you. It's all right. What do we do between now and 8 o'clock? It doesn't matter. I'd take you to dinner if you have any of my money left. Feeding the thief who robbed you, That's Christian charity, I believe. The Biltmore. Well, in about an hour we'll be going to the police station. - You know that, don't you? - Yes. Aren't you frightened? - Of what? - Prison. No, I'm not frightened. At least you're not morbid about it. Where do we go at 8 o'clock? 210, Sutter Place, Larchmont. That's a nice address. What've you got to do with it? - It was my home. - Oh, I see. Well, now suppose you tell me the whole story. You know, I don't mind a line if it's well done. Who lives at 210 Sutter Place now? My husband. That is, he was my husband. He divorced me. A nice beginning. Uh, go on. I'll bet he was cruel. He was. And I ran away with another man. Rather an ordinary line, isn't it? Well, what happened? We separated. Since then I've just been... living one way or another. Yes, one does, one way or another. Now, granting that your story is true, haven't you ever tried to pull yourself together? Oh, yes, many times. I'm still trying. Because I... I really have someone to live for. Who? My child. I beg your pardon? She's four years old today, this is her birthday. You see, that's the reason I... I stole your money. Aren't you getting yourself a little bit tangled up? No. No, you see, ever since I left my husband... he's never allowed me to see her. I've written to him every year... begging him to let me see her for a few minutes on her birthday. I wanted to bring her a toy or something... so she'd know her mother had remembered her. He's never answered me until today. I'm going to be with her tonight. So you celebrated by stealing. Oh, I couldn't let her see me the way I was. You... you don't believe a word I said, do you? You mustn't mind me. I was born cynical. And with no sentiment. Yes, perhaps you're right. Please, could we start now? I don't want to be late. - Wait here. - Yes, sir. Will you please tell Mr. Northrop that Mrs. Northrop is here? Mr. Northram is expecting you. - Where is she? - You're looking very well. - I expected you to come alone. - Oh, this is Mr. Melville. I couldn't keep you and your child apart after all your pathetic letters. Oh, where is she? In the music room. Perhaps you've forgotten the way. I'll show you. - Does she know I'm coming? - She knows nothing. It happened the day before yesterday, the day I received your annual request. Under the circumstances I thought I could accede to it. Little or no harm now. - Feel better? - Yes. Here, drink this and try to go to sleep. - I can't stay here. - Why not? Have you somewhere else to go? - No. - Then that settles it. Come on. All in one gulp. That's it. Is there anything else I can do? Her ring. He must have it. Could you get it for me, please? I'd be delighted to pay that gentleman another visit. I'll be back just as soon as I can. Oh, the watchman. - Who did you expect? - Well, the butler, if you don't mind. Oh, if I don't mind, is it? Well, there ain't no butler. Can't you tell an empty house when you see one? I was here earlier this evening. The owner's daughter... The owner's in Europe. He hasn't any daughter. His grandson is living downtown and he hasn't any daughter. And the gate is out there. - Good night, young fella. - Good night. - What's the number here? - 210. Don't touch that! Stay right where you are. - Who are you? - That should be my question, it's my house. Are you a thief? - No. - I didn't think so. - Not with that face and that necktie. - Oh, you like my necktie? - I was just admiring yours. - Then should we... Why not? It's a beautiful pin. - A rare stone. - Oh, not everybody would know that. Of course you won't mind telling me why you broke into my house. Not at all. I was here earlier this evening and, uh... - ...things were quite different. - Extraordinary, isn't it? - Amazing. - At least it served its purpose. - Oh, there was a purpose. - Oh, quite. You're here. And of course we can't let you go out alive. You'd have a better knot if you made two loops with that tie. Oh, thank you. Wouldn't my death prove rather dangerous to you? Not at all. You broke into my house and I mistook you for a burglar. - I see. I also stole your tie. - So you did. Of course you know the whole thing was a trick to get you here. - But why? - Because you know too much. You're wrong, Mr. Gregory. He thinks he knows too much. Hi, George, old Stony Heart! Just take the impulse and sentiment out of it... and look at a woman with that good clear eye. How do you like beating with the chin, wise guy? Somebody had to trim your sails, you big criminologist, you. Wh... what's this all about, boys? Meet some of the members of my cast. - Your cast? - Mr. Rufus. It was getting impossible to live with a superhuman like you... so we thought we would prove you're just an ordinary human being. He's human, I can vouch for him. Here's your money, except for the price of the dinners. And this lady in distress, is she also a member of your cast? - Yes, indeed. Some clue, eh, boy? - She's quite an actress. And this is Mr. Gregory, my producer. How do you do, Mr. Melville? I took part in this little hoax... because I wanted to meet you. I've been reading your articles... - ...they're very interesting. - Thank you, I'm glad you liked them. I didn't think you were so young. There's a ring of authority about what you have to say. Mark tells me you predicted the murder of the butler. Holy mackerel, don't bring that up again. Just another lucky guess. See, the boys are very fond of me. Well, I'll buy the drinks. I feel terribly guilty. Will you forgive me? You know, you're beautiful when you suffer. And in your tender moments you're irresistible. Maybe they'd like to be alone. Sounds like guns! It's right next door. - Who lives there? - The Shermans. I don't want to miss this. Officer! Officer! - What's happened? - A painting's been stolen. - A painting? - Yeah, a painting by a guy named Van Heims. Oh, sure, the Van Heims painting. What do you mean sure? Well, I knew that was going to be taken next. - You what? - I could have predicted it. You hear that? We teach him a good lesson and now he's off again. Hey, won't anything stop you? Come on, Mr. Melville. I don't think they believe you. Go on, reporters. Grab yourself a story for the Gazette. You know that's a funny thing. I knew that was going to happen. I just neglected to say so. - You don't really mean that. - Certainly I do. Could they be right about you? - What did they say? - That you're terrific. Yeah, that's right. - Quite some excitement. - Yes, sir. I understand it was a Van Heims painting. Quite a treasure. Oh yes, sir. Priceless. From the looks of it, sir, a very successful theft. - No one caught or suspected? - No, sir. Well, well. Amazing, it's alive. The brush work, the flesh tones. Incredibly wonderful. A work of genius, gentlemen. The greatest expression of the human mind. You're asking yourselves whether this bit of canvas... was worth the effort it required to bring it here. It is to me, gentlemen. I dreamed of possessing this painting for twenty years. It would be difficult to explain how I feel towards it. You've done a splendid bit of work. Yes, John? The Melville boy saw Miss Peyton directly home last night, sir. They arranged luncheon for today. After that Melville went to his newspaper office and, uh... judging by the morning Gazette, he wrote a little piece about the theft of the painting. Yes, remarkable boy. Very positive now that Berlea's alive, isn't he? Yes, the theft of the painting has convinced him. He seems to be slipping, however. He didn't predict that the painting woud be stolen. But I heard him say that he could have predicted it. I believe he could have, because he knew. - How? - I'm not sure yet. I've only a theory. I believe that he's a man very much like myself, with a highly developed appreciation of works of art. Only such a man could make such shrewd deductions about me. I believe that the love of beauty that made me an accomplished thief, has made him an accomplished criminologist. That's merely my guess, at present. I shall find out for certain. What if he finds it's you? Oughtn't we to take steps to stop any further predictions from the young man? Oh, no. This is an unusual case. For the first time I've met an antagonist I respect. Since such a man challenges me, I should never forgive myself if I answered that challenge crudely. I'd rather outwit such a man... than have gained the possession of that masterpiece. Mr. Gibbs. Show him in. Oh, hello, Mr. Gregory. We're going to run through part of our first act. - Would you care to watch it? - Of course, be glad to. Come along, Judd. Lunch, folks. Back in two hours. Hold it, Freddie, hold it. Have them run it through again, will you? I want Mr. Gregory to see it. All right, once more. Can you play this? Mr. Gregory, would you mind if we did it a little later? I have a luncheon engagement. That's all right. I'll see it this afternoon. Oh, thank you. And here I was counting on your lunching with me. Oh, I'm so sorry. - Is it a date? - I don't know yet. - Ritz? - Well, it's a gamble. Well, run along, but you're spoiling a perfectly good day for me. - We'll make it tomorrow. - All right, tomorrow. Oh, hello! Hello! Remember me? I'm the girl you asked to have lunch with you today. Yes, of course, Miss Peyton. I was going to meet you at the theater. - Well, the theater's back there. - Oh... Now that's the kind of a fellow who doesn't know where he's going. How do you know? Well, he's the type that'll start across the street, stop and think, change his mind and turn back. - You don't say. - Yes, let's watch him. There, what did I tell you? - I can always tell his type. - How'd you guess it? Well, that's not guesswork, my dear young lady, that's the study of human nature. Uh, study me for a while. Am I hungry? Yes, you're hungry. Where shall we go, the Biltmore or the Ritz? Well, I'll tell you. We'll flip a coin. Heads it's the Biltmore, tails it's the Ritz. Uh... it's the Ritz. Enter, madame. My, how the Ritz has shrunk. Oh, you thought you were going to the Ritz. Yes, you remember we said the Ritz. Now, isn't that funny... You know, I always call this place the Ritz and so naturally I thought... It was just a mistake. Sit down, won't you? You know, you're going to like this much better than the other Ritz. In the first place, there's more privacy, nicer atmosphere... and much better service. - Where's the food? - Ah, the food. Pierre! Pierre! Will you pardon me while I dig up Pierre? Madame. Right this way, please, madame. And what will madame have for lunch? Listen, Pierre, when you say lunch I hope you mean it... because madame is hungry. This is wonderful, madame. Um, what do you suggest? Of course, madame knows the excellence of the Ritz cuisine. Everything is delish. Uh... - Oh... - Perhaps something from the cold buffet. - Oh, the buffet froid, n'est-ce pas? - Oui, madame. Merci bien. Jambon de Virginie... poulet froide, terrine d'agneau Salsemont. Excellent! - And could you step on it, Pierre? - Of course, madame. Nothing but the best. Ah, what a treat for madame. After all, there is no greater delight in life than fine food... delicately prepared. What a treat. And I'm so hungry. Anything you get will be too good for you, you know that, don't you? Yes? Yes. In fact I think it's darn nice of me to have you here to lunch at all... after what you did to me tonight. Well, why did you invite me for then? I don't know. I guess it's because you've got black eyes, a pug nose, a flat, round face. Because when you walk you waddle like a duck. Why did you want to come to lunch with me? I didn't want to. But then, I thought it might be fun lunching with someone who's touched in the head. Ou, so you think I'm a little touched. Did you hear that or did you reach your own conclusion? Both. Is it normal for people to look in crystals and make predictions? But I do it with intellect, with intelligence, and my own little brain. Did you say little? Go on. Oh, no, it's too long a story. I'll tell you the next time we have lunch together. You'd better tell me now because there might not be any next time. You're wrong there, lady. My crystal tells me that we're going to see a lot of each other. You'll find the bread in the breadbox. Be careful of the knife when you cut it, it's very sharp. What I like about the Ritz is the service. And now about myself. In the first place, I was born very young. I was extraordinary even as a youth. The most noteworthy thing about me boy or man was a... was a dynamic something, a ringing energy to be up and doing, you know, an overactive mind. Always searching in strange channels for strange knowledge. You'll find the butter in the icebox. Uh, why don't you just relax, Mr. Melville? There you have the story of my life. That, my dear young lady, is the reason why when other men use guesswork... Melville is able to predict. Oh, come in. - Hello. - I thought you were lunching at the Ritz. - So did I. - So she is. - Don't let me break up this luncheon. - Oh, not at all. What's on your mind? Oh, a little business matter I wanted to discuss with you. Uh, would you like to discuss your business over lunch? - Yes, do, Mr. Gregory. - Thank you. Quite a place. You'd better tell him what he's joining first. - Oh, yes. We're having, uh... - I love beans. Little girl, make it three. You know, of course, you've some very nice pieces. Oh, they're mostly reproductions. I have one or two originals, though, that practically made a pauper out of me. - I had to have them. - Amazing. - What do you mean? - I mean you. A young man with your taste is a little unusual in this age. He knows it. He's just been telling me. Excuse me. - This is not an imitation. - Better not be. Cost me $1100. - It's a true Empire piece. - As good as I've ever seen. In fact, it's what you Americans would call the real McCoy. It cost me practically every penny my first book made. It didn't sell quite as well as I thought it would. But the book was terrific. It was the public's fault it didn't sell. That's right, thank you. - Delicious. - Best beans I've ever eaten. And why? The cook. The cook makes all the difference. I would say the same thing. In fact, with respect to Miss Peyton, at least, you and I seem to have identical taste, Melville. Gentlemen, you make me proud. I hope you fight over me. I can't do that. I happen to need him at the moment. - Oh, yes? - Yes, it's very confidential. - May I? - Please. I brought you the manuscript of Mark's play. There are two or three scenes there that I'm not altogether satisfied with. It occurred to me from reading your newspaper work and your detective stories... that your judgment on these scenes would be very valuable. - Mr. Melville agrees with you. - It's right down my alley. What would a few hours of your time be worth? Shall we say $200? Well, I'll have to think about that a little. But not much. No, I'll accept your offer, Mr. Gregory. Fine! Do you think you could leave off trailing this Berlea person... long enough to give me those few hours? Um, offhand I'd say he could do both with the greatest of ease. You see, I've been trailing Berlea for so long... that I could do fifty other things at the same time... and still be where I could throw a stick at him. I really think you're convinced that Berlea is still alive. You amaze me. Will you please tell me how you can dispute the very fine reports of Berlea's death? I can't. Then how in heaven's name can you go on and make these outlandish predictions... of thefts by a man you've no reason to believe is alive? Because I know that he is. I think I know better than anyone else in the world... just what sort of a man this Berlea is. All his life he's had a mania to possess beautiful things. He had the money to buy them but they were not for sale. He turned thief because he had to have them. A few years before he was reported dead Berlea came to this country... to try and buy the Koor-Hal ruby, the Sunburst diamond and the Van Heims painting. They were not for sale. Two years pass. First the Koor-Hal ruby's stolen. Next, Van Heims painting. That means to me that Berlea's still alive. One moment. Do you imply that the Sunburst diamond will be stolen next? I'm not only implying it, I'm predicting it. And are you telling us that Mr. Berlea is going to slip into the vaults... of the Commercial Bank, pick up the Sunburst diamond... between thumb and forefinger and skidaddle? I don't know how it'll be done, but it'll be done. Melville, you've the greatest imagination of any man I've ever met. And if it isn't imagination, you're a genius. Well, I must be going. - Thanks for the beans. - So glad you liked them. You'll look over the script, won't you? For $200 he'd write you a new play. Well, I never tried but I think I could. I'm coming with you, Mr. Gregory, I'm afraid to be left alone with this crystal gazer. You're gonna stay right here! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. He's a nice fellow. Now, Georgie... I'm going to call you Georgie because I'm going to talk to you like a mother. Why do you make yourself ridiculous before a man of Mr. Gregory's intelligence? Now, Claire, I'm gonna call you Claire because I don't want to be a father to you. You know the prediction I made about the Sunburst diamond being stolen? - You'll take it back, of course. - I'll do better than that. I'll just say it's gonna happen Saturday night. - What? - This Saturday night. Furthermore, I'll write a complete description of what's going to happen. And I'll get my paper to have the presses all ready... so that there'll be an extra out on the streets just minutes after it happens. What do you think of that? I think you're out of your mind. Maybe you're right. I'm pretty sure what I'm talking about. I'm being an awful idiot to put my head in a noose like that. But you're sure of what you're talking about, hm? Oh, yes. Well, I'd love to see your head in a noose... and I dare you to do exactly what you said. - You mean write that special extra? - Yes. All right. What'll you bet it doesn't happen just as I say? Name your poison. If my prediction's right, you have to kiss me. And mean it. And if you're wrong? - You name it. - All right, I will. Now for a final checkup. Release it. This was our position at 6 o'clock this morning, correct? That is correct. Get me Dalio. I think finding our position at this minute we can determine... whether we should be ready this Saturday night. - Hold it, boys! - Hold it there. Yes, sir? I should say within a foot and a half of the side of the bank vault.. That brings us to the wall of the vault in eight hours. Proceed exactly as you've been doing, that is, slowly and taking no chances, drilling only when the subway passes. Go back to work. Okay. All right, fellows, step on it. I think with one more rehearsal tonight... we'll have things perfected for Saturday night. From now on you'll allow no more changes in the script. - Is that understood, Rigby? - Yes, sir. Of course we'll have to be in time to a fraction of a second. Any insertion or an extra word or movement on the stage... would naturally throw off that calculation. This communication with the basement we'll use only to give a checkup signal. or in case anything occurs to retard our movements onstage. The cannon report onstage must coincide to a fraction of a second... with the blasting of the bank vault. Our success, gentlemen, depends entirely on the accuracy of our watches. This is your position. When Michael pushes up through the trap door to give me my signal to go down, it's your job not to allow that trap door to open. If you have the slightest suspicion that the movement is likely to be seen, by keeping an eye on your watch... you should be able anticipate to a second when that trap door will open. - Miss Peyton to see you. - In a moment. Replace it. Until our private rehearsal tonight. This Saturday is definite. Miss Peyton. Well, I see you came out alive. - Did you ever see anything like him? - Frankly, I never did. Oh, after you left, he really got started. More about what? - Everything. Exactly what? Well, it's going to be stolen from the bank this Saturday night. He's writing an article now telling exactly how it's going to happen... and three minutes after the robbery takes place, we'll be reading a special extra about it. That I should say is what you Americans call going to town. He made me so mad I dared him to go through with it. Now I'm beginning to feel sorry for him. Maybe we ought to stop him. Not at all. Let him go right ahead. After all, he's made some astounding predictions. If this one comes off, he'll be a famous man. And you've no moral right to dissuade him from using his own excellent judgment. Come in. - Oh, hello, Claire. - Hello. - Do you want to watch it now? - I was waiting for you. Oh, I'd better go on down. And tomorrow you're lunching with me. At the Ritz. Mr. Gregory. Yes, Mark? The boys have been ribbing me brutally about the delays in opening the show. My nerves are all a bundle of rags. For a month now, they've been offering bets that it never would open. But today I fixed them. Knowing that we would positively open this Saturday night, I took every bet in sight. I acted like a was an angry, desperate man. I put up my last dollar. They grabbed it. Some fun, eh? We're not opening this Saturday night. We're not opening Saturday night? Well, there you have it, gentlemen. According to Melville, the Sunburst diamond... will be stolen from the bank on Saturday night about 11 o'clock. I sent for you because I sensed it was a case for the Federal government. How does that guy get that way? I don't know any more about it than you do. But remember this. No matter how crazy you think that kid may be... some of his predictions have come true. Now there's one chance in ten that this might. Are you suggesting that we call out the whole department... on the rantings of a guy with hallucinations? Chief, I'm simply presenting the facts to you as I have them. My only interest in this case is that if it does come off, I'll scoop every newspaper in this town. And I don't mind telling you for the benefit of my paper... that I hope the robbery happens exactly as Melville says it will. - I got them all planted, chief. - All right, that's fine. You and Jim watch the theater entrance. I'll stay here. Okay. Hello? What? Certainly stick around. Everybody stick around. Don't let anybody go home. Keep those forms open. We'll roll any minute. We're ready to go, chief. Whenever you say the word. Nine minutes. O heavens, what some men do while some men leave to do. How some men creep through skittish Fortune's hall... while others play the idiots in their eyes. I'll know an idiot if this doesn't come off. Eight minutes. Oh, really? Look at the stars. They're winking at me. They notice us too. Operator! Did that call come in? Well, let me have that call the minute it comes in. Yeah. - What's that? - Nothing, chief. Just a couple of kids in a Ford backfiring. Do you hear any little boys shouting extra? I'm darned if I do. You don't suppose that diamond wasn't stolen, do you? You know, you've got something there. Maybe it wasn't. A quarter to three now. - Gee, that's late, isn't it? - It's Sunday. Good thing I don't have to rehearse today. Coffee? Coffee. Ah, Mr. Melville, your editor called and said if you showed up here, to send you right over. I'll have a cup of strong black coffee, please. - Did you hear me, Mr. Melville? - Yes, yes, yes, I heard you. - Bring me a cup of black coffee. - Yes. - So... - I don't think I want any coffee. Wait for me, will you? Something wrong with Mr. Melville? No. Nice boy, hm? - Lovely. - Smart, too. And if you are a smart girl you hang on to a fellow like that. But I bet I don't have to tell you that. In fact... I can see it in your eyes that you are crazy about him. I think you need glasses, my friend. I need glasses? No... I don't need glasses. Hey, what's the excitement? What's the idea of dragging... us down here this time of the morning? Anything great? Who killed who? Get a load of this, boys. The great Melville scooped himself. What's this? When is this supposed to happen? Well, don't you get it? Look at the date. It was supposed to happen three hours ago. It's another Melville prediction, boys. And the old man fell for it and had the paper all set up. Where is this guy? This is one time I'd like to see him. - So would the old man. - Well, here comes the conquering hero now. - Well! - Hiya, George. - Did you hear the news, George? - No, what? Well, you know, the Commercial National Bank. - Yes, what about it? - Well, it wasn't held up. - Oh, wasn't it? - No. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Come in, come in, Melville! Well, well! Don't sit down because you're not gonna stay very long. Have you heard the latest news? - You mean the Commercial National Bank wasn't held up. Ain't that surprising. And you predicted it was going to be held up. - Well now, listen... - I did listen! My presses are all set up! Trucks are waiting for the edition of tomorrow in the streets! Every pressman has been up all night, hasn't slept a week! Every Federal agent in town is guarding that bank... and you ask me to listen? Why, I'm a laughing stock to every newspaperman in this town. Not to mention the cost to the paper, not to mention the liable suit with the bank. not to mention that the Federal Department thinks I'm an idiot! You ask me to listen? No, I don't want the likes of you! Now you listen to me, Sherlock. You're through. You're fired. You'll never get another job as a newspaperman as long as you live! I'll see to that! Now listen, chief, I... Did you say listen? Thanks. - The chief was kinda sore. - I wonder why. - Why would the chief be sore at you? - Well, you see, it's this, I... I went and told him I was gonna quit. - You know how he'd feel about that. - Oh, sure, sure. Now that the boss let you quit, how about throwing a farewell party? Yeah, I was just going to suggest that. Come on. I don't know how we're going to get along without you, Georgie. That leaves the Gazette without a guy that can predict things. Oh, Melville will still slip the Gazette his hot predictions, won't you, George? Otto, see what the boys will have. It's on me. - Scotch and soda. - Hiya, Otto! I'll have a glass of beer. - Celebration? - Yeah, Melville got a raise. - Yeah, right out of the Gazette. - Well, that's one he didn't predict. How come you didn't pick that one, George? - Are you really out, George? - Like a light. But that's marvelous. Now you can take the job in Chicago. Here he is offered a magnificent job to edit True Crime Stories Magazine... at a fortune a week and that old meanie of an editor wouldn't let him go. So I says, George, why don't you make a whopper of a prediction? It'll cost the boss a lot of money and he'll have to fire you. - And it worked! - Oh, yeah? - Very pretty, if true. - You don't say. You can't sell us that one, sister. Come on, George. I'll help you pack. Here you are. Thanks for the phony story. I had to do something. You looked so miserable. Why do you let them talk to you like that? What could I say? I was fired. What of it? That ought to be an easy enough situation for you to handle. That'll hold George for a while. Yeah, well I'm going home and get some sleep. Well, things have come to a pretty pass... when the great Melville has to hide in an alley. George. George. - What? - What's the matter? Me? You're not going to be silly about this, are you? Me? What's the matter with you and saying me? Well, I was canned. That's never happened to me before. You're kidding. Oh, you don't understand. I'm washed up, through. I won't be able to get another job in this town. You talk like a child, George. What do you want? An easy, well-oiled existence? That's no fun. You'll probably lose a lot of jobs and things. What are you going to do about it, sit down and hold your head and mope? Human dynamos don't mope. Oh, Georgie, it's too funny me talking to you like this. I'm sorry. I just haven't got it, not even a snicker. Do you remember our bet? Yeah. I lost. What have you been eating? Have the costumes here Friday for dress rehearsal. We positively open Saturday night. - Good morning, Claire. - Good morning. Did you want to see me? Yes, I've made an appointment with the costumers for this afternoon with you. Oh, good, thank you. - Have a pleasant weekend? - Oh, I was taking care of an invalid. - Invalid? Who? - Mr. Melville. Melville? What's wrong with him? Oh, everything, apparently. Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that. Did you have a doctor? There's nothing a doctor can do. He's just completely lost all confidence in himself... strange as it may seem. - What caused it? - Well... it all started with that horrible prediction. Then his editor fired him and told him he'd never get another job. He's really quite pitiful. He won't eat, he won't go out of the house. He's puttering around with some clay, modeling something or other. - He doesn't know what it is. - Why, this is serious. We've a half hour before rehearsal. Let's run over and see it. - Oh, I was going to ask you to do that. - All right, let's go. George. Oh, hello, Claire. Hello, Mr. Gregory. - What are you doing here? - Oh, just sitting. How long have you been here? Oh, half an hour, an hour, maybe longer. Well, why? - The play. - Well, what about the play? It won't go. It just won't go. I sit at home reading, and reading, and reading, and nothing happens. So I say to myself, do you know what I say? Why don't you go down and sit in no man's land and read some more? Maybe something'll happen. Well, but nothing happened. What on earth are you doing? You're putting dirt in your pocket. Me? I never heard of such a thing. I don't know why I did that. Kind of silly, isn't it? Come, my boy, you don't want to be sitting here on a pile of rock and dirt. Oh, hello, Mr. Gregory. I wanted to see you. This is a marvelous play! Every line's a gem. I bet you want them. And, uh, here's your $200. It's only 190 now because I gave the boys a blowout. Well... bye. Wait a minute, don't go. No, no, I've got to go. I'm very busy. Good evening, George. Oh, is it evening? - Oh, isn't that lovely. - Yeah, it's a honey. - What is it? - It's a map. A map of New York. Well, there's nothing more entertaining than the map of New York. What are you doing with it? - Who, me? - Yes. You mean with this? Yes. Oh, that. Say, do you realize what you're sitting on? Rock. You know what I'm sitting on? Rock. All New York is built on a rock foundation. You never knew that, did you? - Yes. - Well, there you are. There's always something you don't know. Thank you very much. What have you been eating today? Oh, I've had peanuts... That's no kind of food for a great big fellow like you. - How's the show coming along? - All right. We open Saturday night. Oh, you can't open that play, you mustn't. Why? Well... well, because there's the diamond. George, George, will you please try to make sense? It's right in the vault. It's right next-door to the theater. If it's taken, there'll be shooting. Oh, if that happens, I'll be in the theater. Oh, that's right. Well, you can't go on anyway. It's a rotten play. You're sure to be a failure in it. Well, what if I am? Failures are terrible, Claire. Oh, George. George, darling, I can't stand to see you like this. I wouldn't care for anybody else in the whole world. Please, won't you try to pull yourself together? Now, you mustn't be too upset about him, my dear. There are many things we can do for him. I'm going to make him go to a sanitarium. - Would that be wise? - He's got to get well again. I agree, but I don't think a hospital's the place. What he needs is a change. Someplace where it's nice and quiet. - What do you suggest? - We'll discuss that. Meanwhile, suppose you bring him to the office tomorrow. On any pretext you can think of. Miss Peyton and Mr. Melville are here. - Come in, come in. - Here we are. Won't you sit down. What is it, George? Well, I thought I saw a light in the wall. Light in the wall? - Do you see a light, Claire? - No. I'm sorry, I guess I must be crazy. Come and sit down. Won't you sit down? No, thanks, I'm all right. George, I've been telling Mr. Gregory that you need a rest, you ought to get away. I perfectly agree, you've been working too hard. Aw, shucks, I always work hard. Claire and I have begun to worry about you. - Please believe us, George. - Oh, I believe anything. We think a rest in some nice, quiet place would do you a world of good. For instance, the mountains. You know, I have a lodge up in the Berkshires... I'd be happy to place at your disposal. Uh, thanks, I think I'll sit down. You'll have all the fishing you want, horses to ride. My servants are up there. Up where? - In the mountains, George. - In the mountains. Oh, yes, the mountains. I see no reason why you shouldn't start immediately. Shall we say early tomorrow. Tomorrow. Early. I know you're going to love it up there. We're coming up Sunday to see you, George. - Thanks. - If you want anything, just send me a wire. Bye! # It's a long way to Tipperary # # It's a long way to go # # It's a long way to Tipperary # # To the sweetest girl I know # # Goodbye Piccadilly # # Farewell Leicester Square # # It's a long, long way... # - Another company going up. - Yes, it's the fifth. Are you sure? What's the matter, kid? Is that Tommy's outfit? Yes. Well, they all have to go up sooner or later. Might as well be tonight. Vive la guerre, baby. # It's a long way to Tipperary # # To the sweetest girl I know # # Goodbye Piccadilly # # Farewell Leicester Square # # It's a long, long way to Tipperary # - Hello. - Hello, kid. Just dropped out of the car and... I'll be seeing you. - Everything snug here? - Everything's swell, Tommy. Did they tell you they figure I'm just the fellow to finish up the war for them? It's lasted too long. I figure it'll be over in a couple of hours after I... - That's a way to talk. - Thanks, Joan, I... Oh, Joan, how can you bear it? It's more than I can take. - Tommy! - I'm afraid! I haven't got the legs to take me up to the front. I can't make it! Tommy, get up! Maybe I'm not a man because I don't want to be shot full of holes! Maybe I'm not a man because I want to live! Listen to me! We're all in this and we gotta to stick. It's going to do some good, Tommy. It's going to prove that there must never be another war. That's what you're fighting for. You know what you mean to me. If you went back now you could never face me again. I couldn't bear it, Tommy. Did I say two hours? I'll have the war finished in 20 minutes. Wait for me, kid. Keep looking for me. You know when you have to remove this painting. I know the cue backwards and forwards. Not long now. - How are you feeling? - Fine. This is our act, Ridley. - How are the nerves? - Never better. Ready. Forward! Hey, what's this? Come on! Maybe they've killed him by now. Wait a minute, take your time. I don't know what you're talking about. I want you to get in touch with the police in Emmetville, N.Y. That's in the Berkshires. That's where they took him. - Who took him? - Blackton Gregory. He's Berlea. - He just stole the Sunburst diamond. - Holy Mackerel! It happened five minutes ago, but I don't care anything about that. You've got to save a man's life. Now get on the phone and do something about it. Hello! Did you get the painting, chief? What are you talking about? I gave you your instructions to get it. Yes, but when I went up for it it was gone, so I then I thought that you... Gone? Impossible! - Did any of you... - No! - Drive back. - Yes, sir. Don't touch that. Stand right where you are! All right, boys. Fathead. So he didn't know what he was talking about, huh? Let me tell you one thing. If he's dead, it's your fault. It's my fault too, but it's your fault in the first place. The Sunburst diamond was stolen tonight just as he predicted. You know who stole it? Blackton Gregory. He'd have told you that too, if you'd given him half a chance. He may be dead now for all we know. And let me tell you. You're gonna print that story and you're gonna put his name on it. You're gonna say that he predicted it and that he's the greatest man that ever lived. Well, you big fool, what are you just sitting there for? Wait, wait a minute... They're loading the trucks. The edition will be out in the streets in three minutes. Great! So, you wanted us to do something for your fine young man? - You've got to! - Okay, lady. Read that! Spectacular theft of Sunburst diamond. Hey, hey, wait a minute, Charlie. I said read it, not gargle it. Spectacular theft of Sunburst diamond. George Melville promises early apprehension of Andr? Berlea. So. - He wrote that? - Your fine young man is alive and kicking. - When did he write it? - This morning. - In a back room. - Where is he? I don't know any more about that than you do. All I know is, look... "...promises early apprehension of Andr? Berlea." And don't ask me how or why. He promised and I'm waiting. Hello. Oh, hello, George. Yes, shoot it! - Mr. Melville, I think you're the lowest... - Was that my little girlfriend? All right, George, go ahead. George Melville captures Berlea. Now, unless that's the headline word for word, you don't get the rest of the story. Okay, okay, that's the headline. Now give it to me, will you, and be quick about it. Berlea will be led out of here in about five minutes. Now get your cameramen out here. I hate you! Hey, get off there... you... - Is that you, George? - I love you, sweetheart. - Hey, who are you talking to? - To the grandest little actress that ever lived. - On or off the stage. - George... George... Give me some facts, will you? What did Berlea say to you... I don't know what Berlea said. But do you mean to tell me you were acting all this time? Butt out of this, you! Darling, that little hoax you pulled on me was the inspiration for everything. All I am or hoped to be I owe to you. - And now we're even. - Yeah. - Now we're through. - Hey, can I count on that? Well, I predict that within five minutes... You predict nothing, I'll do the predicting from now on. - The whole world's waiting for this... - Let them wait! I'm going to make a prediction that will make Melville look like an amateur. I'm gonna make him suffer for the rest of his life. Wait a minute, chief, get this. This'll be good. And what are you going to do, my love? I'm going to break somebody's neck. What am I going to do? I'm going to marry you, that's what I'm going to do. George, what did Berlea say? I love you, darling. George, what did Berlea say? I hate you... darling. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
