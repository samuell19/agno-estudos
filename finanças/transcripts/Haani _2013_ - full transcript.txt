And some times you cut a chicken and put in it... ..and he country liquor is ready. Forget all that, don't you put cow dung in it? No they don't put that in it. Should I give you a good slap! Making fun of me? Let it be. Now tell me, what was there in last night's drink. Beer, whisky and country liquor that's all. No, no, no, Harman... ...first we got liquor from country liquor shop, and then rose flavor one. Water was a bit more in it. And to balance all these things, the real thing which was added... ...it was the vaccine with which cows are inoculated. And the local punch is ready. Oh, here come the Lassi. Okay, guys it's your wish. Here is the lassi... ...I would only say... ...if you add country liquor in this lassi and have a nice sip...

How much they liked this necklace for? Fifty one. Now it's mine. Nimmo will be startled seeing it. - No. What? The necklace is mine, my friend. Yeah, so how much is it? Fifty-two. - How come is that, man? Yeah? First you settled for fifty-one with me. The necklace is for my damsel. Mine has chosen it and gone. Necklace will be worn by her only. And as far as money is concerned, it will be what he asks for. I am not let you take this. So my friend Jagara has started singing again? Before the end of the song, you try and get it from me. And then necklace will be yours. - Wonderful! Two tigers are ready to fight. But in this festival fight starts with equals, that's why. The one who runs from the arena... ...then it isn't right for him to stand and challenge. That too with one... ...who keeps roaring like a tiger in the arena. Those who fight in the ring then show your might here! Beat him! Come on, smile guys! What's the name of the young man? His Ranjeet Singh from Maan Marna. Man, Marana guy swear a lot! Have long life, Ranjeet Sing! Come on, my buddy has become the great lover! Not yet, brother. Take the token of becoming a great lover Mirza. By the way, the necklace was suitable only for your dame.

Naseeb Kaur, I am going to a concert. Shut to door. Okay? Yes, fine. This area is that of ladies. And Sukha is yours. I had conveyed your message. Now, the courage is hers. And the luck is yours, Ranjeet Singh. Sister-in-law! Now brother too has left. Let me too go to the concert. Yes, sister-in-law, from our terrace we can watch the performing singer. We can clearly see it from there. Really, sister-in-law really... - Now stop it! You've rotted my brain talking the same thing. How many times will you repeat it? Don't know what a new hobby of listening to music! Entire village has gone to the concert. Now you, win over her. Come on, you too leave now. Listen. More than the Sugar from Sugar Cane... ...she will be tastier. Get lost, damn you! Return before your brother returns, and don't put me in trouble. Go. Hey, why this way? Sister-in-law, brother would be that side so... - Yes. Come let's go. Oh, now they are out to listen the concert. I nearly died... - I too. If someone sees me. Let's so that we reach there safe and sound... Where do we have to go? - This way, this way. Come, come. - I am here. Come, let's go quick. - Hey you are in so much of hurry! Come. - Yes. yes. It's the opposite terrace. Go. - It's fine. Okay, listen, listen. You are in too much of hurry to go? Don't be too greedy. - Oh. Oh! What's this Oh? It's me. I was scared. If somebody was at home, then? Nobody is at home. Come in. All of them have gone to the concert. Jagir had arrange for everything. Okay? Come now. No... Yes... Jagir made aunt a go between for you wedding. She will talk to your brother about it. But... Before that I want to talk to you something. Why have you gone quiet? No. Thinking that you are brave.

My son Harindar. He's two years old. So what's is it to you? That's all, was it? I will be everything to you. Seems we've bound to each other since ages. But I am afraid of my brother.

This all the game of fate. Swear on you. As long I breathe... ...this token of your love will remain here. Mingled in breathe, always. Is it? Really, Ranjeet. Grandmother. Grandma! Your heart seems like containing lots of sorrows like Heer. You love your son so much? Tell me something. Did grandfather gift you this necklace you’re wearing? Sweetheart, we elders keep the truth close to our hearts. We don’t tell the facts to the world. In time you will read the truth in my eyes.. ..because my grand daughter is just like me. Where did you find the necklace? I met an unfamiliar boy.. ..he has given to me. Rinku! Deep hasn't returned with the burgers yet. He'll be here. He is coming with the burgers. Here he comes. It's been 2 years since you've been following Preet, and no results yet. Something will definitely happen. Our elders are old friends. Then why do you keep following her? Have to be watchful, lest some other lover boy type runs away with her. Hey, bro! Where's Preet's boutique? What? Why? What for and where are you from? From Canada. Want to place an order. did you land here directly from Canada? My village is Marar. Oh, I see! It's that way. Thanks. Lucky? - Yeah? He seems to be a lover boy type. Hey, Preet! Oh, hello! You here? Surprised, right? Will you have some tea or coffee? - No, no. Thanks. Hey, this is very modern? I thought it would be very rustic type. Hello, one has to be modern from within, not outside. And, in order to progress forgetting one's past is foolishness. Exactly! I think so too. You speak very well! And your... dressing sense is so good. Enough praising me and my boutique... ...but do tell me, what do you do in Canada? I... There's a nice cafe nearby, will you have coffee with me? Chhotoo! - Yes, ma'am! Bring two cups of coffee. I asked, what do you do in Canada? Well my, dad is a rich businessman in Canada. And we've the largest manufacturing company and we... - Hello! I am not asking about your dad. Will you get this packed? Okay, ma'am! I asked you, what do you do in Canada? Just chill. Enjoy. And also beat up white and black guys. Did you hear, what does he do in Canada! - No, no... I just spoke, It's for fun and all. That's it. Oh! Dad did suggest a few jobs... But, I believe one should do a job which one likes. The way you are. Okay, anything else? Right now, will have to go home. Then... shall I drop you? Thank you very much, I have my own car. Today's meeting was nice, bye. Hmm, Mr. Harman. This girl is old fashioned & modern. I'll have to work on her double time. Yeah? Coffee. Hey, That Marara guy who asked about Preet's boutique is here again! Isn't it Lucky? Hey, hero! Let's have a chat. Yesterday there and today here? Same can be asked of you too, man. Yesterday there and today here? Bro, take care of our sister-in-law to be, or this guy will run away with her. Constantly buzzing suitor and shoe warming suitors... They call girls, their sisters an item, goods and other things. Don't know what's wrong with these writers, singers! How many boyfriends do you have? I shall kill many for you. Hey, lovers pray for each others' well being. And you, what are you writing? If you have to write, then write like the great poet Bulle Shah. Write like Waris Shah. If you have to be a real lover then be like Punnu. Be like Raanjha. Be a Heer. "Saying Ranjha, Ranjha I myself became Ranjha" "Don't call me Heer, call me Ranjha instead" This is real love. Hey, this isn't a show, it's a rehearsal. - Oh, sorry. Whom do you want to see, by the way. - Sir, he's here to see me. You really delivered a nice speech, about real love. I only say that what I see and experience. Yeah, why are you here? Happy told me that you are doing post graduation, besides managing the boutique. So, I was here in the city... and my car broke down. Thought, could take a ride with you. Will give me a ride? I am really surprised... In such a native atmosphere, a girl like you? self-employed, talented, intelligent! And confident too. I mean, look at the confident way you drive. You also know the distance to be kept from the car ahead. and from prospective suitors? Oh... No! That's bad driving. Hey, where you going. This way, right here. Thanks. Hey, do you want to come in? No, thanks. - Hey! O, Harman! So how things? Got to her? She's coming back for you. Look back. Harman, Harman! Harman! Is there something wrong? Everything is cool. Look back. Back. She's there, bro. Your car had broken down, isn't it? Yeah, that's another car. What did you tell me in the car? I am Confident, self-employed... - Intelligent, talented... You are nothing like this. You represent today's spoilt youth 100%. Father has ample wealth. So what's the use of doing anything? Have fun. Awful way to live ! Listen. Enough of your nonsense - praising me and my work, trying to meet me. After today nothing like that should never happen. That's it! Full stop! Shut up! Don't shut up me, man. I am telling you this. She's the right girl for you, bro. Oh, that's nonsense. I have seen many girls like her. Hey, no, son! Preet isn't such a girl. she doesn't like your show off style, Then she will have to change her mind about me. What? Go then. Hey go, he's far away. Go! How far? He's quite far. Get lost. Yeah, I will go. But you are too much. It's the ghost's deed, and gone! Hey, are you leaving or should I make you leave. Look, my honored ghost, sir. Get up! Up! Go. Compare to being with him I should go back to my mom in Bihar. Harman! Be mindful of Preet's thoughts, in the future. That's so strange, grandpa. What do you know about her thinking? Strange, really strange. I may not know her thinking. But I do know the thinking of the one who brought her up ... ...what he thinks. She is just like him. Now! Tie a turban, and get decked up and roam around the village lanes. And just roam the lanes aimlessly. Just don't do any work. Had not I told you about Ranjeet when I saw him the first time? Yes, but.. - But brother Gurjant has gone to Ranjeet's village. If he too feels like me, then what will we do? Then you do this... Ask Gejjo aunt to talk about my alliance. I'd be a slave to him all my life. But for your sake he made me his sister. Have you gone mad? My heart is beating with fear! Let it be, don't worry. My heart says, that both of you will be a nice couple. Sis, what's going to happen is what destiny decides. Destiny? Yes. He is my destiny. Sir, his land is about 35-40 acres. And at home, and there is only his grandmother. Hey, Modu! Who is Nattha is moving around with? All the village goons, scoundrels and rascals... ...gather at Ranjeet's home in the evening. Now you tell me... Who does not like free drinks? And after drinks Jatts won't fight? It isn't possible, simple. Hello! - Hello. Yeah, it's true. - The guy seems to be an outsider. Why are you standing there and rubbing your feet? Come here quick! I am here. - Now take this milk there. Quick. Bro, Gurjant! Loombad has nobody of his own He merely keeps jumping from one door to other. He keeps watching everyone. Keeps a tab on others' comings and goings. He's the typical back biter. No aunty, no. No, bro Gurjant Singh. Its true. Whatever Loombad said, there isn't much substance. But one more thing. Uncle-aunt might have hidden this fact... ...that my first wife who died. had a son. He's two years old. My son Harindar, and is being brought up at his maternal grandparents home. Have long life, aunt. You don't find such guys even if you look for them. I like Ranjeet Singh. Ranjeet Singh! He still stands true. Yeah, Jatts are like this. I say, I too am a proud Jatt! And I like this. Aunt! Aunt, here take the token amount, and consider the alliance finalised. Bless you, bro! You've kept my honor. Hey, then come give me a hug. Congratulations! Lots of congratulations. No. "Yours and my pairing will last for ages." "It will be the merging of two fates." "Two fates have come together..." "Fates have come together." Grandpa! Its very nice! Super music! But tell me, whom was it sung for? Harman! Harman! whom are you talking to? With grandpa. Hello, grandpa. There. Oh, hello, grandpa! What? He too! One had already lost his mind, and now second one too has lost it! Hey, is it that Canada has sent all their insane guys here only? Lest me too get affected, I will go.. What's wrong with you, buddy? I thought you were joking or drunk that's why you were behaving like this. But you have gone crazy, man! Should I call the mental home? I swear! Grandpa talks to me. Listen. He taught me this song too. Son, Harman! The words are the same and it is the same tune. Who taught you this song. It's good, isn't it? My grandpa taught me. Oh, I see. he came down from heaven to teach you? Was he alone or did the fairies too come with him? And did not he tell you this, damn fool... ...that I had taught him this song. Ask him about the story of Shamo's in the Kapah fields, this big guy! Did he tell you anything? Tell me, what did he say? Yeah, he told me. He also told me... ...that you used to watch Shamo plucking the flowers and sing. And you had a fight too for her. - Shut up! Dont dig old graves. So how is it, grandpa! You do teach us a lot. But we did not know about your errands. I am going to tell, grandma hear about your escapades.. It's good. So nice. He treats me more like his real grandson. Do you know? All the old guys in this village call me grandson from Canada. After all the people of my generation are gone... no one will place their hands on younger ones heads to bless them. In our times, whenever a girl came to her mother's home... ...then all elders would go and bless her. And everyone welcomed all the sons-in-law. This is what our culture is. You should take it with you back to Canada, my son. All right, grandpa. You too come with me. I am... I can't cross the boundaries of the village, son. Why not? Life after death... I mean, Is there a life after death? Tell me grandpa, what had happened to you? What shouldn't have happened, happened. I had dreamt about living my entire life with someone... But just me... The night of parting is very long for your grandfather Okay, forget it. How did you like the song? It is such a wonderful song. Why did you not teach it earlier? Just like that. Whom are you talking to? Is grandpa here? Standing behind you. Behind me? Don't be afraid. He's grandpa. Look. I can't see anyone. Is he like a vampire or a ghost? He is neither a vampire nor a ghost. He is the same as he was. He is smart & handsome. Listen, he taught me this song too. It will be very useful to me. Good, Harman! Very good! Isn't it? Yes, sir. This is the tune we needed. It fits our situation perfectly. Students what do you think? Yes, it fits perfectly. But what about the lyrics, sir? Yeah, Harman... The movement will be the same, on the lyrics, right? Yeah, movements will be the same. You can continue the dance movements. I will try. Sir, how did you recognise an artist in a strange guy? Last Friday when I went to the music shop... ...Harman too, had come there to get his guitar repaired. And when he played the synth, that was it. I just knew that he was the guy. He is the only guy who can do our job. Very good Harman. Thank you. - Harman, in this creation... ...our Preet's beauty and style too has an hand in it. You agree to it, don't you? Shut up, Raman. Yeah, now I don't need to be here. Bye. Raman! - Yes. You are right. - Oh, yes! Oh, Harman! Harman, by the way, tune's & lyrics are great. Thank you. Harman, I find this aspect of yours very appealing. Stop! - Appu! - Yes. We've come to the last rehearsal of the play.. ...but your posture hasn't any thing called love. Why? Isn't Herman? No, sir. When he saw Preet he so well patted her... Everything was good. Just something like calling for play was left. Alright, then why don't you teach me to act? Brother, you got angry! Not at all, Mr. multi-talented. Now that you have commented on my acting you have to teach me how to do it. Show me, how to do it? Beyond expectation. Wonderful, Herman. Amazing. What a couple! Today my car is really not working. Did I ask you anything? Come. Thanks. Hey, Lucky, the new lover boy really got her. No matter.. I shall have a talk about it with my father. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, no problem, bro! Just come Punjab, we all are free. Have lots of beauties. Nobody is bothered about guys who do nothing. Bro, here it's lots of fun. Why do he call me Ramu Great? If I don't drink this canned drink... ...I shall crush it and... Everything bro, everything is available here. Local brew is so strong the make. Oh. Now have to go. We will meet tomorrow. Bye. Hi, Toni! - Preet, what's up? Hey, Gant! O, Harman! Herman, I am sure, so you've have got Preet. You're really a dog! Did not tell me even? Did you act like loving dog? - Get off! What's wrong with you? What language you're using? But... Talking about swine behaviour... - Hey, what is it... Hey, she is a very cute girl, do you know? Stop it! - Herman When a dog pulls other dogs legs... ...dose he minds it? Then why are you doing this? And yes he pull his tail too, be he does not bite. This is called dog love. Have you done it? Tony, from where learnt this? Happy, taught me. It's Punjab culture. Go and tell it to your father. That you have learnt this from Punjab. Oh, buddy! Oh does not mean a peg. It could be water too. Get lost! Ok, Don't worry, I will correct my mistake. Damn you! Come on, man! What's wrong with you? Why are you getting irritated? - Leave me. In Canada when you used to go around with dames... ...then you used to tell us about it with pride. Herman. And then you used to sleep with her within 20 or 25 days... ...and just for sake of hugging a girl now you are behaving like this? Oh my, God! Preet went home very happy? This means, he has completed the journey of 20-25 days today itself? Shut up! Preet isn't such type of girl. You will get a slap if you talk nonsense like this! Sorry, bro. Wow! Might be falling in love. You know to strum heart stings well. Seems, heart's strings got tuned of my grandson. Isn't it? Grandpa! By being with someone today, it felt so strange and sweet. And after that, all my feelings and everything changed. What's it? Love. Son, you are in love. Now you have become one. You are my grandson... If I had body, I would have hugged you. Yes, grandpa. May I try? No, man. - It may happen. I am like air, how would you hold it. Should not we both try? As you like, son. Grandpa, if the hugs are like this here, let go. Herman, son. This? Nothing, grandson and grandpa are hugging. You are so much educated, how can you say such things? Please believe me, grandpa. Otherwise, that song... ...and the Shamo's thing how would I have found. Ranjeet is still here? He standing there. How does he look. Just like me? Tell this gray bearded fellow, that's what the benefit of dying young. Yes. I look like unplugged flower. Same as I had died. Did he say anything? He says... This is the advantage of dying young. He is same as when he died. He is same like that. Talk to me. Why doesn't he talk to me? It's been fifty years now. Oh dear... Ask him to hug me too. Tell him... He is standing before you. We played together, grew up together... Go you fraud! Go you deceiver! By dying early you cheated this friend. Herman! Don't die like me. I could not fulfil what I could... What I could not do you better do. With honesty fulfil heart felt desires. By becoming my real grandson and friend. Hi, Preet! - Hi! Hello! Why are you sad? Preet! I find myself under burden. The foundation of true relations cannot be false. Which relations? Your and my relation. Meaning? Since last few days whatever is happening in the theatre... ...according to me it was not natural. It was fixed, planned. Professor meeting me in the shop... ...and that song... ...the one which I claimed wasn't mine. It was the creation of my grandma. What? So that I may set up you for myself. Why? A few days ago you had insulted me. That due to my father's wealth my thoughts are bad. That day you hurt me. That's why to take the revenge, I planned all this. Then why are you telling me? Preet, while enacting this drama I came closer to you. And liked it. And after that my feelings changed for you. Last time, my friend grandpa told me... 'Herman, deal honestly with your love" And what he said it struck me here. Preet! There is no one like you. I never found one. After this confession of mine, I might lose you, be refused... But this is the truth. I am very sorry. Hey! Hey, Hero! The one you are after... ...our elders are already talking about our marriage. And I am the one who gonna go for honeymoon with her. Hey, you broke my arms! Preet! Preet! Herman, isn't that kind of boy. Of course many girls came in his life and went.. I know him from last ten years, Preet. He has never behaved like this. I swear, Preet. Flirting with you he fell in love with you. Otherwise, why would he tell you truth? Please, Preet! Don't do something wrong. Do make wrong decisions. Please. "Hey, your and min pairing... Grandma, tell me what am I going to tell you. The song? Forget about it. First you tell me what I am going to tell you? You are going to make someone meet with me. Oh, my God! How did you come to know? It's in yours eyes. Go and bring him in. He is here. Herman! Sukkha! Where are you lost? Nothing. Just I was lost seeing what I had seen. Herman. Oh. My respects. - Welcome. Have a long life! You are good, lovely. Come sit down. From where you are, son? From Canada. Actually I am from Toronto. Oh I see, so you have come from Canada. Where at your back, son? At the back? Back means, your village in India. Oh, yeah. Marara. Marara? Yes. Very near. It's very near. You've been there? No. Went were close but came back. Which family you belong to, son? Your father's and grandfather's name. Oh, yeah. My dad was always in Canada. But here the name runs of my grandfather, Ranjeet Singh. Ranjeet. Do you know him? What happened? Grandma, what happened? - Ranjit?! Nothing, I just recalled something. I will be back. You show him around the house. I will be back. It's all right. Come I will show you my house. Oh Lord Almighty, what's this game of yours? Herman, this is my room. Wow! Beautiful! Looking at it a fellow may die! - Shut up, Herman! By the way, this house is like the grand daughter... Is that so? - Really. It's first time someone has held my hand that too so hard. My fingers have started to pain. Oh! Are they so delicate? 'Fingers have started to pain.' 'Are they so delicate?' The pairing of you and me... Pairing of you and me will last for ages.... Lord! Let these kids not have the same as mine. Harman! hmmm... Mother, you do like him, dont you? Then everything must be fine. And I also trust my Preet totally. My dear Preet! - Yes. Do this, ask the boy to come and meet me in the morning. Now, go and bring a nice cup of tea for your father, on this occasion. Yes. Mother! what was the name of that boy? Harman. Lets meet Harman once, then we'll see. He is from Canada, well educated, handsome, everything is fine. Also listen... One does not waste time for good things. Rashpal! Son, did you mind that... Preet chose the boy herself... - No, no! I was thinking about uncle. He is coming tomorrow with a boy. for Preet. He might feel offended. Otherwise, I have no problem for Preet choosing a boy herself. Provided everything else is fine. I, you, uncle... all would have searched for a bridegroom for her. Then we would have asked about Preet's liking. Its good that she found him herself. If only my brother too had thought the same as my son... Gurjant Singh, have you arranged everything for Sukha's marriage? Yes, it is next month on the 15th. Oh it's better, if the girls are married off soon. Brother, Ranjeet Singh! How are you doing? I am very fine, brother. Brother, I got the invitation for your wedding. But tell me something, man? My to be sister-in-law is the same girl... ...whose necklace we fought for in the fair? Yeah, she's the same. Oh wow! Great! You are lucky, bro! Come inside with me. I have got to go. - Hey, come on! When exactly is the wedding? Next month's fifteenth. You must come. Oh sure, I will be there. Someone else married my Nimmo. But I certainly will come to see your girlfriend, becoming my sister-in-law. Okay, come and pray. You might get your Nimmo back. Sister-in-law! Don't do this. Sukha, move aside. You saw this? Don't know what thoughts you are lost in! my nephew is coming... You should be happy. I am happy. But since your brother, has returned from the Gurudwara... ...he is mumbling something. Says he does not accept this alliance. Sister-in-law, somebody must have filled his ears with some nonsense. He himself went & enquired about everything in Ranjeet's village. Yes! He has finalized the date too. But what can you say about him being misled. You know your brother's nature. I worry lest he do something wrong. Sister-in-law! I will go to Ranjeet's home. Otherwise I will... - No! No, dear, don't say that. Don't be so disheartened. I will talk to your brother tonight. Dear, I say... I am saying... I feel you are bit under the weather. I will massage your feet. Nothing is wrong with me. Go to bed! If you have heard something tell me, why're you hiding your face? She's made me incapable of showing my face Everyone is talking about our girl openly. Even before finalising their alliance Sukkha and Ranjeet knew each other. Now again someone has filled your ears. Nobody has done that. At the Gurudwara, Ranjeet and Surain, were discussing our dear girl. Now here you go again. Boys keep talking and joking about girls like this. Here, have some milk. Don't try to hide her mis-deeds! He had also been fighting for her in the fair. And I did not even know of it! They fooled me. I feel like cutting her up into pieces and burying her. No, no! Don't commit that sin. I beg of you! No! Let go off my feet! Don't do that. What happened, grandma? - Nothing. The past came back to me. I am sorry, grandpa. But you old guys, suddenly wander away in your thoughts. Today, Preet's grandma got lost in her thoughts after seeing me. She said, "I was seeing what I had lost in the past". Then? What? Preet's grandma, how is she? Her nature, how does she look? She's Preet's grandma, must be good looking. I saw a photo of her in her youth. Don't ask, she looked so beautiful! Really, a man would die for her. Is that so? I swear. Had you seen her when she was young... I guarantee that you would have been knocked out. O Lord, what a creation. A guy would die for her. Come, dear. He's a lost cause. Lost! I lost the world itself, Tejo. What did you say? Harman! - Yeah! Downstairs, Preet's grandma is here. Come quickly! Sukha! Sukha has come home? Our home? Sukha! Harman! Harman, where are you? Fifty years ago I would have entered this house. This is called fate. Fifty years I was to be welcomed... ...was to be a bride. But that remained a dream. What dream? Home of my beloved Preet. my dream house. Then why not enter? The son, has brought a bride... Brought her at the right auspicious hour. The welcome is so heartening and its celebrations all over. The girl is so beautiful... Hello! Hello! Hello, grandma! - Hello. You, here suddenly? Please come. Preet, grandma here suddenly? She wanted to talk to you, so she is here. - What? What does she want to talk about? - Don't know. Sukha. Grandma! Where are you lost? Come. Harman, Grandma got lost in her thoughts in your home. Come on, anyone who comes here gets lost. Shut up! Yes? - Yes. Son Harman, come tomorrow morning and meet my son. And yes, only talk about your relatives in Canada. Anything related to your past here, your village... ...name of your grandfather's name, you don't need talk about that, son. Why? I didn't understand anything. So I asked grandma to tell you herself. Dear. When old names pop up, then old secrets too come out. And we are unaware. of what transpired in the old days, good or bad, or a fight... ...past could come up as a problem before you. I don't want you to have any problems. I don't get it. Son, you'll know everything at the right time. For now, Listen to me and do as I say. As you say. Have long, happy life. Grandma, you should have some tea or... No, son. - Great! No. It's time to go now. Some other time. - Ramu! This village is near by. But time sometimes doesn't let people meet. And this small distance becomes too long to cover. Dad's reaction was favourable on hearing about you, Come in the morning to meet him. Meet? Why? Harman. Son come tomorrow and meet my son You'll find out. Preet, let's go. Should I explain something hundred times? You have to ask for my hand, Don't want to get married? Can't you understand! Where had you gone leaving the village boundaries. You know, I can't cross the boundary. Preet must be waiting for you for you. Don't you want to go? Grandpa, I... I will not marry her. Why not? Do you think she should simply go around with you ? Nothing bad. What's wrong with it? This is the way in western countries. This happens in big Indian cities too. But in Punjab? It doesn't happen in Punjab, son. Here the traditions are still alive. You won't understand, grandpa. How do I explain you! I understand, grandpa. Not there, here. Here. - Yes. Grandpa, his qualities... He's present right? - Yes he's here. Grandpa, he has commitment phobia. I mean, he is scared of relationships without reason. He had the same problem in Canada. Grandpa, if any girl got serious... ...he ran like this. I forgot those girls, too, didn't I? So it is not necessary... that I should keep loving Preet after a few years too. - You will. You will keep loving her. Else you would not have come here leaving those girls in Canada. And you met Preet again due to that necklace? The same necklace I had given her grandma fifty years ago. The same things are being repeated with you. What happened between me and Sukha... It's an indication from the Lord. Mine and Sukha's incomplete story... Our incomplete love story will be completed by you two. Its destined. Try to understand the Lords plan, son. Try to understand. Yes, uncle, good. Everything is fine. Here things are progressing. From here you will reach somewhere. Don't worry. I am gonna receive you at the airport Should I bring him from the airport? As it is they've kept me in fear of the ghost... ...and now they are adding one more. - Harman! Harman! - Here comes the Jet aunty. What did you say? - I just said hello. Tony, where is Harman? He is not answering his phone. And he isn't here ? He forgot the phone at home, and he has gone to your home. Oh, God! - Is there something wrong? Grandma did not wish that he should come in front of Uncle. And who's this uncle? Grandma's brother, who else! Preet! What's wrong in this? Gurjant! Sarvans Singh, Rashpal is not merely my nephew... ...he is like my son. - Oh I see. So tell me Rashpal Singh ji! When should I bring my nephew here as the groom? Brother, give us some time. Relationships aren't formed everyday. We will let you know. All right. I haven't ever refused Gurjant Singh. Rest is your wish. Please dont mind, before the uncle told us about you... my mother had seen a boy. Whom Preet likes. By the way, I & uncle have to meet him. My mother likes him. We'll see afterwards how things happen. Greetings! Greetings! - Son, you here, suddenly? Be blessed. You go inside. According to me, he is the same boy, right?- Yes he is... Sit down. Yes. - Be seated. What's your name? It is... Harman. Harman. Harman which is your village? Sir, I am from Toronto, Canada. But, you must be having some background here? Maraar is his village. It's Maraar. I know him. Yeah, keeps roaming about the university. His village is Maraar. Maraar? Actually I have come to Punjab for the first time. As a child, my father lived with his maternal grandparents in Kalkala.. ...then he went to Canada. That's why we don't have any links in Maraar. Why did he live with his maternal grandparents? Sir... my grandpa died before I was born. Brother, why are you talking like this in front of them? What's your father's name? Sardar Harindar Singh. Harindar Singh? My son, Harindar. is being brought up by his maternal grandparents in Kalkala. Are you the grandson of Ranjeet Singh from Maraar? Yes. How dare you ask for my grand niece's hand? I have still not forgotten the taste of the food in jail. Please, forget old matters now. I know my about my grandpa and your sister's affair... Shut up! No, no! -It may happen that you may die by my hand! Harman! Harman go. - I will.. Hey, Gurjant Singh is still alive... Now stop that. Forget about the old issues. Harman, don't say anything! Uncle! Ranjeet's grandson, will he come to my home? - Uncle! Uncle, please don't do it. - Couldn't you find anyone else? Let him go! What did not happen fifty years ago, it will happen today. Uncle! - Gurjant! You never told me.. ...that Preet is Sukha's grand-daughter. After grandma, it was Preet's dad & now his uncle. Grandpa, who is he to stop this marriage? That's what it is. Otherwise Sukha would have been Harman's grandmother, What? You and Harman's grandpa... Really? Oh, my God! How, when, where ?? Fifty years ago... ...in Jand Sahab Gurdwara... Ranjeet and I met for the first time. With that shock, sister-in-law lost her dream of being a mother. And at the same time my dream of being with Ranjeet was shattered. Then? Then... Then it happened, what should never have happened. Dacoits Sukha, run! Sister-in-law! Brother! Looters are here! - They are taking away Sukha! -You go inside. Somebody stop them. - Brother. Save Sukkha. Hey. Listen, I will go look in the lane. You come soon. It's me! Have you gone mad! Yes, I have gone mad. You are my love. Gurjant can't break his promise to me. Come, I have come to take you. This is not right. How could you think that I will come with you? My brother will have to listen to the taunts of people his entire life. You, me. That I eloped from home. This stigma we will never be washed away for generations. Yes. Ranjeet! Think ahead. Don't think I have changed. I am yours, will always be yours. We should keep our love within ourselves and be strong. Brother will have to agree. Be quick man. - Be quick. Lets' go. You continue with the Jeep at the corner, I will follow. Okay, but make it quick. I was angry so thought of this & became crazy. Please forgive me. I will go. Ranjeet. Ranjeet! Ranjeet! Sukha! No, no! Let me go! - No, no. Now we will meet in our next lives.. My life is over...I have to leave this world No, I will come with you. No, no! Promise.... Promise me, that you won't go alone. Promise. I promise. - Ranjeet, No, no! we will be together... We will leave this world together. No, nothing will happen to you. I swear. Ranjeet, I swear you... Come, get in. Ranjeet! I will die without you! Jagira! At least let's save him. Sukha! Sukha, what have you done? What have you done! Sukha! Ranjeet, hold on. Stop the jeep. - Yeah, I will, I will. Nothing will happen to you. - Have courage, Ranjeet. Hey, nothing will happen to you. Have courage, you will get through this. Nothing will happen to you. It's my last moment, my friend. Oh, no! Ranjeet! Ranjeet, hey! In front of me... I see The God of death on a bull with huge horns He is there, sitting and watching me. Take away this earthly body of bone and mass. No. Don't say that. But my spirit will not go without Sukha. Sukha! I was saved. But Ranjeet passed away. Grandma! He had promised that we'll go together... ..but he broke his promise and left. I and my friend were jailed for two years. And Gurjant was sentenced for 7 years, for murder in self defense. Family and Sukha's relatives told her to think of the family... Then she was married off to a army man. But later he too was martyred in the 1971 war. So son, this is the end of the story of my friend. No, grandpa. The end is still pending. Hey! Hey, now it's enough, friend. Spit out the anger, my son. - Why did not you tell me earlier... ...that Preet's uncle had murdered you. Then your and Preet's love would not have progressed. Forget about the murder, it's fifty years past. But I heard of it now. That my grandpa was murdered. But it was my murder, I have forgotten it. Forget it. Think of the future. I have thought. Hello. Hello, Preet! Yes, tell me. Oh... You have courage, I will... - Dad.. Shit! What will you do now? I will take her to Canada. Let them do what they like. Fifty years ago, I too thought the same. I would take Sukha and go to Calcutta, my uncle's place. But Sukha did not agree to it. Preet is the same Sukha's grand daughter. My grandson, my friend! Why will Preet agree to your proposal. Grandma, take care of yourself. Since yesterday you have not ate anything. I can't forget that time... For my sake Ranjeet left this world, for just one word of mine. The blood flowing from his back... ...is still in... ...in my eyes,like the tears of blood. Grandma, please don't think about it any more. Girl! Aren't you ready yet! Go get ready. Rashpal! Rashpal! I will not let my girl go to Gurjant. Your mother is not dead yet! I know. This dear girl's grandma is still alive. Wanting to kill the living. She is better dead. Dad! How could you say this to grandama? What's wrong with you? When my daughter and my mother.. ... are ready to compromise with the enemy... ...then they should not expect anything good from me. But you had agreed, no? Uncle's foolishness cannot... - Shut up! Beware, if you utter a single word against him. Uncle... Is everything for me. During the 1971 war, I was a small baby... ...when my father martyred. Do you know... who stood behind me at that time? The same uncle. Uncle... Was like the shade of a huge tree on our head. The same uncle today, to you and your grandma is the bad guy. I know everything. Grandma has sacrificed everything to safeguard uncle's prestige. Hello! Hello! Sarvans Singh. We are leaving from here. You reach AkalGad. Yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Bye. Darshan! Come here. Oh, welcome, Harindar Singh! Was your flight on the right time? My respects. Have a long life. Live long. Tony must have told you everything on the way, right? Now what to do further? Uncle! - We should sit down and discuss.. - Uncle. There is a problem, Happy called just now... He has gone with Harman to Preet's village - AkalGad. AkalGad, Yes, to fight. Damn it! Now the trouble begins. Hello! Sarvans Singh, you've been here many times with uncle. But you will be our relative today Rashpal. - Yes. So what's the news. Preet! You aren't ready yet? The groom's people are here. Get ready. Dad! Am I an animal? Will you hand me over to anyone whom you like? Why did you not tell me earlier. Is this the reason that you brought me here? Rashpal! Dad! - Shut up! Uncle... Stop! Listen. Today you get engaged. Or it will be your funeral. And I am... ready for both eventualities. Get hold of him. Catch him. Hey, what's going on! Have you gone mad! Hey, where did he come from! Dad! Uncle! Uncle, who has let him in? Dad! - Damn you.. I say stay put here! Don't move. Hey, hold him. Harman! Take care of him! Call some more guys. Damn you. I'll break your bones. That's all! Hey... Come along. Preet! Harman! Stop. Go back... Uncle? Harman! Brother Gurjant! Gurjant, brother! Brother! Brother, Gurjant Singh... You are still in the same position Where you stood fifty years ago? the world has changed... ...but you did not change. You, too, have not changed. sister Sukhjeet Kaur you are still standing where you stood fifty years ago. Then you were running away... today you are helping your grand daughter elope.. ..you called Harman here? Yes. I have called him. Me! I was right then... ..and I am right today too, and what I did was always right. Neither is Preet eloping nor was I running away from home. Yes. Ranjeet, for the sake of the prestige of both our families... ...was returning alone. When you shot him at the back. Then... For the family's sake, wherever you sent me... I went. ...I quietly got married. But... like wet fuel... I kept smouldering inside. Brother... It would have been good... ...would have been much better than this torture... ...you should have shot me too at that time . What did not happen that time.. ...I will do it today. I too kept on suffering my entire life. That I did not kill you at that time. why did I climb down the terrace when Ranjeet told me to? Thus you got the opportunity to shoot Ranjeet? Now I will not give you the chance to kill one more Ranjeet. You shot my friend at the back. I shall shoot you on your chest! No, uncle! No! Dad! Ranjeet's son? Harindar? Live long. Gurjant Singh, first you killed my father. Now you are standing ready to kill my son. I can forget everything and forgive you... If you are ready to accept the true love of these kids. I don't care nor believe in any damn love. You will have to accept. For the same true love... ...my friend's soul is still wandering here in this world. It's wandering here for Sukkha. My friend's spirit talks of his sorrows to Harman. So you... He had promised you, didn't he? 'Promise that you will not leave this world alone!' Promise. 'Yes, we will go together from this world.' No. No. Ranjeet's soul... ...still... is still wandering! And me... I never realised. I kept living. My... Lord! No, no! Grandma! Grandma! Ranjeet... Ranjeet. Ran...jeet... Grandma! - Mother. Grandma! Grandma... My God! Doctor! Doctor! Take her to the hospital! Hey, what happened to the car? - I don't know. What happened? Don't know why the car isn't starting. Do something! It's not firing. the car had to die on me now! What happened. - It conked out. Take Harman's car. Grandma! Dad, my car isn't starting. Harman! Where is your car? - My car too isn't starting. Sir, your car! This one too has conked out. Oh God! Every car had to stop here? Sir, your village is nearby, please arrange for a vehicle. Hey, it's no use ! No use. It's no use. Grandma! Come out of the car. Fate has brought Sukha to the same place... ...where she had to be. My friend Ranjeet... half century ago, took his last breath at this place. Preet. Yes, grandma. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma, Grandma! Mother! Now see, Gurjant Singh. not my home... ...but we are going together to the Almighty's place. Gurjant, brother! Ensure that.. like us, you don't lose these children. We are on our way to the Lord. They who loved, found God. Gurjant, why are you standing here ashamed? will you meet us in God's presence ashamed too. Enough.. enough. I made a big mistake. I committed a crime towards both of you. This sinner had the curtain of misunderstanding on his eyes. But now, this has opened my eyes. I was...I was.. I am not even worth your pardon. Harindar singh, congratulations. Your son is married. Congratulations to you too. For the wedding of your grand son! Yes, we should do something new, what's new in it? New thing is already here. You know the best man... ...he is always younger than the groom. And Mr. Chief, here the best man is hanging around with big mustaches. Hey, lets not show off. Its not done that way, This is how it's done. Hurray!
