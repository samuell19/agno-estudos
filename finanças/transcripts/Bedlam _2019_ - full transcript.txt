- Psych ER, this is Dr. McGhee. Don't be ridiculous! - Did you promise to stop screaming and just relax? - Sit down. - Thank you. - Call a code, please. - Call a code. Call a code, please. - First med unit, 114. - Psych ER, how can I help you? - You're safe. You're safe. You're in a safe place. All right? - Lock me up, bitch! - Hey, hey, hey! - You made a threat with a gun. You have a history of mental illness. You admittedly haven't taken your medication for a very long time. You haven't really been completely cooperative with the police. Sir, I'm gonna need you to take some medication before I can-- - Oh, I don't need the medication. I'm fine. - He's benzo-dependent, alcohol-dependent. He's gonna be a nasty withdrawer here. Don't you shut it! - How many times have you been in psych hospitals? - A bunch, like, 40-something. - Where do you normally go to try to get help? - Uh, just wherever. Nobody knows where to go. My name is Dr. Snowdy, and I'm a psychiatrist here. Maybe you could tell me just a little bit about... how you came to be here today. - Well, I had suicide thoughts. - Oh, my goodness. Had you ever told anybody that before? - No. Just kept it to myself. - So sorry you've had to deal with that. Have you been able to sleep? - No. - You're waking up in the night? - Yes. - Do you dream? - I don't dream. I have nightmares. - Unfortunately, you know, once patients leave our hospital, there's really little we can do. You know, we can't keep people detained for long periods of time, months, years. - They'll put him in, like, a mental hospital. - Right, we'll send him to a mental hospital. Yeah, no, I know that he's there for a few days, a week, and they discharge him. - And then we'll have the same thing over again. - It's--I'm afraid that's-- that's the system. Almost every American family at some stage will experience or has experienced a case of mental affliction. And we have to offer something more than crowded custodial care in our state institutions. Our task is to prevent these conditions. Our next is to treat them more effectively and sympathetically in the patient's own community. I hope that Congress will act on this bill. It was called de-institutionalization, and in the last decade, hospitals have been emptied of almost 1/4 million former patients. - In theory, de-institutionalization was supposed to get the mentally ill out of the so-called human warehouses and back into the community. But in reality, the mentally ill were just turned loose. It's estimated that between 20 % and 50 % of the people living on the streets of America's cities are chronically mentally ill. De-institutionalization remains the rule, forcing thousands more mentally ill Americans out of treatment and out on the streets. - The people living on the street here, Anderson, over 40 % of them have mental illness. Serious mental illness is America's great secret. I started my training as a psychiatrist in Los Angeles 25 years ago, and I returned to LA to one of the busiest and most highly regarded psychiatric emergency departments in the United States, to understand what it means to live with serious mental illness in America today. It's a story that I know from my profession and a story I know from my family. ♪ Budi-budi-boop-bop, bop-bop-bop ♪ ♪ Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop ♪ ♪ Bop-bop-bop-bop... ♪ - So you don't want to take off the handcuffs? - Nope, not right now! The truth will set me free! Budi-budi-budi, Namaste! Someone told me that! Someone who was raped told me that! Budi-budi-boop, I love everybody!

Nope, get the out of here, like I said, so I can be okay! - Johanna, so I'm just gonna give you-- - Got it? Do you understand? Budi-budi-boop. - Johanna. - Who are you? I don't care! Budi-budi-boop.

All right. This is Caitlin. - Hi, Caitlin. My name is Dr. Lacsina. I'm calling from LAC+USC. I was calling because we have a patient here. She's here in our psych ER. Can you tell me a little bit about Covenant House? Is this like a homeless shelter, or like a halfway house, or? You're a homeless shelter. Okay, thank you so much. Have a good day, bye-bye. - Do we understand? Teamwork! - Teamwork. Okay, teamwork. - No, no, no, I don't trust it! I refuse! Get the off of me! - Relax! You need to relax. - You need to relax, okay? - Fine. - It's just a poke. He's almost done. - I don't care. - That's it, almost done. - That's what it takes, sir? Are you happy now?

The world is that rape. We're screaming for money. I cannot afford USC. I cannot work hard. I cannot clean vomit all the time so I can afford what I need. I work at the Science Center. I work-- She's presenting with lack of sleep, distractibility, grandiosity, most recent episode manic. Um, and then-- - With or without psychotic features? - With psychotic features. - Okeydoke. - Yeah, and rule out substance-induced psychotic disorder. - What do you want to start her on? - I was thinking Seroquel, maybe. - Because? - Because, well, at the APA conference that I went to, they had a study that they talked about that showed that the Seroquel as a stand-alone medication seemed to work really well for the bipolar patients. - If you would like to start her on Seroquel, that's fine. What would be the downside of starting her on Seroquel? - It could cause hypotension. - It's going to be very sedating. Some people, boom, they're on the floor with it. - Yeah. - And some people not. I don't know with her. It's gonna be a guess. - You want to know what I learned from the drug rep people? Okay, yes. - They said to start on, like, for people who are manic, start with, like, 200 on the first day, and then increase to, like-- they said increase gradually. So by the fourth day, you're on 600. But if they're in-- - Yeah, think about what their incentive is... - Absolutely, I agree. - Versus what we need to do for the patient. What are the major side effects of Seroquel? - Metabolic effects. - Yes, and Seroquel is super high on that. She's a young lady. We don't necessarily want to fatten her up, but also we're not necessarily deciding on her... - Long-term meds. - Long-term meds, but important to be aware. - How about-- - That's all I'm saying, just that those are some of the conversations you can have in your head about why this one versus that one versus the other one. - Won't you tell me your date of birth? Huh? - What'd you say? Mental illness is not something people want to hear. It's not something they want to talk about. And it is a lifelong disease. That's really hard for people to hear. In some ways, I think that's the hardest part of the job, feeling their--their pain. I understand how difficult it is. My brother got sick with bipolar disorder pretty much right after I graduated. Putting my brother in the hospital is by far the hardest thing I ever had to do, so I get it now from the other side what it's like when family members put whoever family member in the hospital. And, you know... the feelings of guilt and, "Oh, is this the right thing?" That kind of-- I totally get it. - Stress or anxiety or PTSD or--you know. And they're training a lot of dogs for soldiers who are returning home. - Yeah, they really seem to like it. I saw a couple shows on that. - Yeah. One of the soldiers, he named his dog, like, Prozac or something because he was like, "It works better than any pill I ever took." How do you go from that point to this point? - It was a really long process with that time in the hospital. It wasn't my last. I've--since that time, I've been in and out of maybe about ten in the last year. So, um... but right now, and for the last three or four months, I got off of medications. Oh, he's so big! - Here. - Okay. - We'll make him fly out at you. Oh, it's scratchy! Look, it's all over my hands! - Very nice. - My dad will sell the monarchs and the painted ladies, and then sometimes he'll-- he might be able to get other species from other butterfly people, but we usually tend to stick to just these guys. - Jo, how long since you've been taking medication regularly, not counting the hospital? - I haven't been on any medications since October, November. - I worry about you, Jo. - I know. - And I just want to make sure that-- - I didn't say, like, "I'm not gonna take medication. I don't need it." It was, "Okay, the medications are making me worse, so let's try it without it," you know. If I take it and it helps, that's great. I wish it was that simple for me. Like, "Oh, you know. Oh, I found this pill, and it worked." Before there were medicines, there were no reasonable treatments for those with severe mental illness. We injected near-fatal doses of insulin to induce a coma and calm the worried mind. We used electrical currents to induce a grand mal seizure to somehow reset the mind. We hammered a pick through the eye socket to reach the brain and then blindly chiseled away at the frontal lobes that were said to house the emotions. Frontal lobotomy won the 1949 Nobel Prize in Medicine. It was performed on Rosemary Kennedy, sister of the future President of the United States. The procedure was a disaster. Rosemary had to be institutionalized for the rest of her life. It was a family secret that would shape the course of mental health care for a nation. Around 1950, by sheer serendipity, modern medicines like lithium and Thorazine were discovered. Because the medications could stop the hallucinations and delusions, finally, patients could leave the asylums. That was our last revolutionary breakthrough in treating psychosis. For the past 70 years, we have relied on the same compounds, sometimes the same pills, which pharmaceutical companies have tweaked and re-patented under new names. In the past 15 years, major funding for new medication trials for schizophrenia has decreased by nearly 90 %. Today's treatments save lives but have serious side effects. 50 % of people stop taking their medication within one year. - Were you formally diagnosed with a psychiatric condition? - Yeah, they said schizophrenia. - I noticed that you have some movements of the face. How long have you had these facial movements? - About ten years, I guess. - Ten years. It's a side effect of antipsychotics, basically when you take antipsychotics for many years. The nurse's note said that you wanted to cut your neck. Is that correct? - Yeah, it's painful. It's also painful to sometimes hold my head up straight. - I know it's uncomfortable, but the medication that we're gonna give you is gonna help. The medications that we have today, they're definitely more effective for depression. We understand how to treat mania better. We understand a little bit about how to treat psychosis better and how to mitigate the impact of the side effects of all of the medications, but at the end of the day, the treatment really hasn't changed, and it's not that much more efficacious than it was 50 years ago. - Hi, everybody! Come on in. It's a horrible mess. So, yeah, this is about to get bad. But that's how things get better, so come on in. Probably we can donate rather than sell most of this. - What's going on here? - We're trying to clean it, and I made it worse 'cause I was like, "Oh, you know what I'm gonna do? Just take it all out, and then we have to deal with it." And then it's like now, I can't deal with it, and look what-- The next time we saw Johanna, her dad had gotten sick, and for several months, he couldn't live at home. - I got this at the Dollar Store right across the street. Music! So it's been bad, but it's been good because you have to have the bad times to recognize the good times. The light to rise, wake up. The darkness to slow down, regrow to up, down. Die, live. Bipolar. I think we all are, and it's a blessing. It's a curse and a blessing. It's yin and yang. There's a Japanese art form where when something cracks, you fill it in with gold and it becomes better, stronger, faster, Kanye West, the robots. There's my bike. What we're doing, medications, water, then orange juice, melatonin, so not Xanax or anything like that. Can't do antidepressants. This man... Depressants that are supposed to bring me down-- they crack, trigger the bipolar, which becomes amped-up psycho and makes it worse. I need to sleep; I don't know the last time I've slept. Look at this nasty food, which I still haven't eaten. I can't even feed myself, so that's that. And I'm trying to, like, go to school and keeps knocking me back. Everything was supposed to, like, get me ahead and knocking me back. And my manager called me over and over: "Here's your schedule. Hope to see you." Didn't return his calls. Couldn't pay my phone bill and just stopped showing up. Johanna asked to be taken to the only place where she felt she could get help, some 50 miles away from her home at the LA County Psych ER. Mother nappy time, hello! No wonder he put in his earphones. Oh, my gosh, this guy has his work cut out for him. - Look at your--look at-- - Ma, show me the pictures! - Wait a minute! - Show me the pictures. - I can't. - Turn it around. - That's the one. - What, is he mesmerized with his camera? - He's making a documentary. - Oh, there's great pictures. Wow. I think this was the happiest year of my family and probably the last happy year of my family. When I was 14, my beautiful and kind 20-year-old sister, Merle, suddenly became psychotic. Roaming the streets of downtown Philadelphia, Merle found her way to the apartment of our sister Gail and her husband, Bob. - And it seems so long ago. - Yeah, it does seem long ago. I can tell you it was around 1971. 1971, so you were how old? - We were only married three years. I guess I was 29 or so. - All right. So I was just starting high school. She was-- I guess she had to be 19, 20. - And she got married. - Yeah. And then the marriage broke up. That's when Merle had her break, when she was at the University of Maryland. She came over to sleep over one night. I went to bed early, and Gail and Merle were talking. Maybe around 2:00 in the morning, Gail came in the room very hurried and a little panicky. She says, "Bob, you got to get up. "You got to get up, and you got to come out here, and you have to listen to this." I went out into the living room, and Merle was totally hallucinating. And she didn't know who we were, was very paranoid. It was very scary. She was so frightened of us, we decided we'd have to call the police. - My parents drove here, I guess, the next day, and my mother was in the car, crying and wondering why the hell they had taken Merle to the hospital and going back and forth. My father was fuming. He was not very happy that you had taken her to the hospital. - No, not at all. And Gail and I were besides ourself. It was so clear that Merle was out of her mind. The world's oldest mental hospital was built in London, England, in 1403. Bethlem Royal Hospital would come to be known as Bedlam. 600 years later, "Bedlam" took on a new meaning, a rallying cry for shutting down some of America's most disgraceful mental institutions. Mental hospitals like the one my sister was taken to were far from ideal, but they provided necessary care. In the 1950s, there were 558,000 patients in America's asylums. By the time I finished my training as a psychiatrist 40 years later, over 90 % of those beds were lost. Even the psychiatric hospital where I had just trained was demolished. Like most of my peers, I went into private practice, and like most of the graduating psychiatrists, I did not treat the seriously mentally ill. 20 years later, I wanted to understand why this happened in my profession. I spoke to eight past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association and asked them how our country and our profession came to neglect our neediest patients. - The movement from state hospitals to community to jails and prisons is probably the saddest part of the story of 20th century and early 21st century American psychiatry. - They threw everybody out of the hospitals in the '70s. You know, that was a mistake for people who need custodial care for their whole lives, and we didn't--we didn't even think of that. I organized a conference at the Association's annual meeting... And so many other illnesses... About the role of psychiatry in this crisis. - And I have yet to find a single county in the United States where there are as many seriously mentally ill people in the county mental health facility as there are in the county jail. If anyone knows anyone-- I invited Dr. Fuller Torrey, America's pre-eminent expert on serious mental illness. - During my practicing lifetime, most psychiatrists have not spent very much time taking care of people with severe mental illness, and I will say that, quite frankly, I have not been proud of my own profession over the years. I think in order to understand the disaster that we're looking at today, you really have to start in the early 1800s. The jails and what they called the poorhouses at that time-- there was an increasing number of people who today we would say have serious mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder. And people like Dorothea Dix and others said, "It's really inhumane to leave these people in jail. "It's not where they belong, so let's put them in mental hospitals." So then over the next 100 years, the hospitals kept being built and built and built. The states paid 96 %, 97 % of all the costs of people who were severely mentally ill. The federal government had almost no money in the system at all. There was a huge incentive for the states to close down these hospitals because they effectively shifted the cost of the care of these people from the state government to the federal government. - I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear-- As soon as Kennedy became president, he both speeded up the emptying of the hospitals, and he created 700 to 800 community mental health centers around the United States to try and prevent the development of future cases without paying any attention to the people who are already sick and the people who were coming out of the hospitals. Once the people were in the community, then they became the fiscal responsibility of the federal government. Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mr. Nixon who will present Governor Reagan. During the 1970s, both Nixon and then Reagan had no understanding of mental illness. When Reagan took office, he stopped the federal funds that were going directly to the community mental health centers. - The excessive growth of government bureaucracy and government spending-- So what Reagan was saying was, "The feds should not really be involved in this. Let's give it back to the states." The states, of course, they didn't want it back. There's not any single Ronald Reagan to blame for it all. There's ten presidents since 1960 that were all responsible for it. State governors, state legislators, everyone's responsible for it. This is a 150-year-old disaster that has ended up being really the largest social disaster of the 20th century and now the 21st century. - You love your mama? - We're the love and peace people in all the world, yes. California has been the canary in the coal mine from day one because they were at the forefront of emptying out their hospitals. So today we are seeing problems in the emergency rooms as we're seeing everywhere, but you see them worse in California, where there are almost literally no state hospital beds left. - Let us know if you need anything else. - Okay. The emergency rooms are overrun with the people with severe mental illness. - Yes, ma'am. - So just 'cause I just got off the phone Mark-Anthony-- - Uh-huh. - A couple things. When you take you to this other place... - Yes. - One, just try to remember it's a hospital. There's not-- - If there's no red dragons there-- if there's a red dragon there, it's all bad because I'm-- - Okay. - I don't get along with the red dragons. - Okay, I don't know if there are or not. - I'll fight-- no, let me stop you right there. It really doesn't matter if there is. - Okay. - 'Cause if he's there, I'll take his ass out anyway. - Okay, okay. - So it doesn't matter. Okay, go on. - But-- So they're gonna take you from here to there in an ambulance. - Mm-hmm. Okay, let me think about this for a second. Ambulance, so if the ambulance is going at its right rate, it should get me there in a certain amount of time, but if somebody tries to intrude and crash over and kidnap me and hold me hostage, then what are you gonna do? See, you got to be able to answer these questions before you let me out the door. - Okay, they are gonna restrain you when you go, so you can just get prepared. I know. It's a pain in the butt. - Restrain. When you say the word "restrain," it's like a trigger. - Yeah, I know. - Okay, let me tell you. Okay, I'll explain something to you real quick. When they say the word "restrain," okay, it goes like this. One, two... restrain! - Yeah, I know. That's why I'm kind of trying to give you a heads-up. I had no idea about mental illness. My mother had no clue. If you've ever, you know, dealt with anyone who has any sort of psychosis, it's--there's lots of fear. And so there's one moment when he was in prison where they had to do a cell extraction, which literally means take someone out their cell, but how they do cell extraction, they're just horrendous. He was too scared, and so they started teargassing him and macing him. And... I mean, I just think that's what you do to enemy combatants, not people who are citizens of your country. And in jail, how was he treated? - Oh, terribly. - Just take care, homie. For what kinds of crimes? They're all, like, non-violent mostly crimes because he was in an episode. - Now you see me, now you don't. Klu... Klux... Klan! - This is just, like, a diary that I keep every time he goes into the hospital. This was back in 2013. Says, "In the late afternoon, from Justine, "that Monte was breaking everything. "Refuses to see psych doctor. "He had pulled the back door off the hinges "and broke the glass. "Monte tells the doctor "he wants to rip the doctor's eyes out. The doctor is very calm. Monte is growling at security." Okay, you know, it just goes on because this episode lasted last year for 27 days. This one, how long did this last? Like, 19 days, maybe? 19 days, yeah. - I just love my brother so much, um... And he's perfect to me. He really is perfect to me, so... I feel like when he was diagnosed and when our family sort of really had to come to terms with his diagnosis, I just-- I refused to allow it to tell a different story that I already had about my brother. And I refused to allow the stigma to sort of shape how I was gonna relate to him. And if anything, it just brought us closer. And I made a commitment to myself and for my brother that I was gonna be with him, no matter what. Every downfall, and every jail sentence, and everything that was around his mental illness, I was gonna make sure that I was way more equipped to deal with it than I felt like, really, society was. - I met a lot of good people in the hospital, staff and inmates, so to speak. I got a lot of new friends. Even said I can come back and visit if I want, you know. - You want me to cut that? - Yeah, get scissors real quick. - Okay. You got it? - Yeah. - So sounds like it was a positive experience, pretty much? - Yeah, it was rough at first. The first three days, I was in restraints. You know, after that, it was positive all the way through. - Yeah, one of the nurses said, "Are you taking Monte home?" I said, "Yeah." She goes, "Aw, he's so sweet." I was like, "Yeah." - Are you taking medicine now? - Yes, I'm taking my meds. I take Seroquel, Klonopin, lithium and... Zyprexa. - Does it make a difference? - Yeah. Well, I feel fine. I feel better. Feel better than ever. You know, I feel healthy. I feel good. I don't feel no side effects, like, think strange or anything, and it's okay. - Do you want to let folks know that actually the food is done? Enough food is done for everybody. - Oh, okay. - Paul, I'm right here with Monte, Paul. - Hello, Paul. - I'm right here with your nephew, Monte. - Just hanging out. - What's up, Monte? - All right. Feeling good. How about yourself? I'm doing good, man. What kind of party you having? - Just a welcome home party. My mom didn't want to tell people about my brother's mental illness at first; she didn't. I think there's a lot of shame in Black communities in particular around mental illness. Shame is dangerous because shame makes you hide things, and when we hide things, we don't get the support we need, and when we hide things, we're not as honest and transparent about our needs, and I think that shame literally kills people. Shame kills our possibilities of having something different. Monte had been off his meds, had a manic episode, and broke a window in a convenience store. With Patrisse's help, his case was heard by a judge in a specialized mental health court program. - Number ten on calendar is the matter of Monte. When we were here last, I said that you were gonna be evaluated both by the deputy probation officer as well as by the Department of Mental Health. I've got a report about whether you would be a good candidate of this program. If you were to be placed into this program, it might do you some good. You're charged in count one with destruction of property with a value of more than $400. It's a felony. Do you understand the charge against you? - Yes, sir. - The maximum sentence for this charge, if I were to strike the strikes, is three years in custody that would have to be served in state prison. That's not the sentence you're gonna get right out the gate. But if you violate your probation, if you violate any of the terms of the treatment program, you could be sentenced to the maximum, and the prosecution will be asking for it. Do you understand that, sir? - Yes, sir. - You have to undergo mental health treatment at the direction of the probation department in consultation with the Department of Mental Health, most likely for up to a year. It's gonna be tighter supervision than ordinary, run-of-the-mill probation. But if you're willing to do it, we're willing to try and hook you up with the people who can help give you help. - Yes, sir. Until the court could find a treatment facility that would accept Monte, he waited in jail for four months. Today the three biggest jails in America are also our three largest psychiatric treatment facilities. Across the nation, jails are being built specifically to house the mentally ill. We have 1,560 mentally ill in Tower One right now. This is a high-security jail that was built for high-security inmates, and we are now housing mentally ill folks in here, patients in here. - These people are severely mentally ill. They need a lot more than we can give them here, but we do the best we can. - The vast majority are homeless, presumably, right? - Yes. - So living out in the streets and sidewalks and shelters. - Right. - There needs to be funded resources so that when these folks get out, and if they're taking their medication, they can make it to those facilities or those programs and get the treatment that they need. - The state of mental illness in this country is beyond the trite notion of crisis. It's at a point of comedic absurdity. We built more prisons than universities. Our budgets for prisons are actually higher officially than our education budgets. In California, it's a remarkable fact there are as many people in the prisons with mental illness as there were people in 1960 in institutions of care for mental illness. About 37,000 people in 1960 were supported in alternatives to carceration, and today they're being supported in a jail system. There's about one of every four inmates in California, exacerbated by a recidivism rate of about 70 %, which is even higher for people that are suffering from mental illness. What's the saddest thing you see, if I may ask? - Just, you know, the number of people that we just completely given up on is just staggering. The controversial Prison Realignment bill, is it doing more harm than good? During the years we were filming, the crisis in Los Angeles went from bad to worse. To reduce prison overcrowding, California released 18,000 inmates into Los Angeles, over 8,000 of whom had a history of mental illness. Around the same time, several Los Angeles hospitals and clinics closed down. Some psychiatric hospitals even dumped patients onto Skid Row. - We allege that the patient was dressed in nothing more than hospital paper tops and bottoms, had no money, no identification. All this translated into an increase in admissions and an increase in violence in the ER. This is for my safety and your safety. Oh, my -- - All right, this is for my safety and your safety, all right? Just relax, have a seat. The doctor who takes them off, right? Just help us out. Come on. - What just happened? - What just happened is, these have been with me for over 20 years! Okay, okay. - What I would like you to do is hang out in one of the seclusion rooms for a while, okay? Without the handcuffs. But it'll be a locked room. - Yeah, so now you want to put me in another cell? - You-- - Where I spent the last 20 years of my-- come on, you dick-ass cops. - Stop, slow down. Slow-- punk-ass. - Slow down. We ain't messing with you. We ain't messing with you. Yeah, you the are, man. Cops around me! The out of here! - Once you're ready, we'll be here. When somebody is a mixture of both depressive symptoms and manic symptoms, which is the opposite of depression, it's a real irritable, angry kind of emotion, lots of energy, no sleep for days, which is what he's in the middle of. - Yeah, we all want to work with you, man. We want to-- - Okay. We come to a hospital, man, and I'm treated like I'm back in prison. - Do me a favor. Listen, she's a doctor. All these cops around me! - Want me to get out of here? We'll get out of here. Talk to the doctor. - The out of here! - Let's go, we'll get out of here. It's hard sometimes to be compassionate, especially when, you know, they threaten to kill you and stuff like that, but... he may have had abuse in jail. It's not uncommon. All I want you to do is take the Seroquel and the Klonopin and hang out in here with the door locked. In a cell. - Yes, I'm sorry that it feels like that to you. I'm not here to make you feel like you're in prison, but I got to respect the safety of everybody here, including you. Klonopin, I gave him that one. - I thought we had it locked. What's the deal? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I'm your doctor. - Whoa, whoa, I'm talking with the cop now, somebody I know and respect, who I've dealt with before. I'm the one who ordered it, though, not the police officer. - Hey, if we have mutual respect, do me a favor. Just go back in your room, then we'll talk in there. How about that? Do that for me? - You guys are gonna lock me in there. - It's up to the doctor. She's the one in charge. This is her house right now. - You know what's gonna happen when I come out of there? It's gonna be a cell extraction, and I'm gonna come for her. - Okay. - I'm letting you know that right now. I'm coming for you. Come on,. - Matter of fact-- - Don't let him go. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. , This is not what we talked about. Come on! - Code green, code green! Press the button. Press the button. - Got to go, he's got to go. Come on. - Don't do that. - Code green! - Code green! - Push the panic button! Get off my back, bitch. - You need to relax there. - Did you look at his mouth or no? - No, he refused treatment. - Refused treatment. Hi, it's Dr. McGhee. I would really like to know if you have any injuries. I promise I'll leave you alone. I just need to know if you have any injuries, and-- - Okay. I'm gonna listen to your heart. What I see, especially from the emergency room, is this ridiculous merry-go-round. People get sick because they don't take their medication, and how can you ask people to take medication when they're living on the streets? Hold on. - I'm gonna straighten your leg. What do you need? Good night, Diana. - Okay, bye, Doctor. We are still enjoying the gift of Reagan policy back in the '80s. We chose to go from keeping patients institutionalized their whole life to having them live on the streets. For whatever reason, we've decided, as a nation, that that's acceptable. - People can, uh, use this address as a mailbox, so you can get your mail right here. People don't have addresses, so... People only got so much fight in 'em, you know. It's either fight or run. I've been fighting for so long that I go back and forth from fighting to running, fighting to running, fighting to running. You know, it's like a big circle. Right now, I'm fighting again. You know... Because probably of my medical situation, and I don't want to die on the streets. But a lot of people out here suffer from either drug addiction or mental health issues, and that's why they're down here. It's sad. It's really sad. You know, I suffer from it and these people suffer from it, and there ain't no help nowhere. We just keep going around in circles, and we get nothing. It's just sad. Whatever place is gonna put me in the quickest place is where I want to go. - Mm-hmm. - You understand? Whatever place comes available that says, "Yes, we can move him in the next couple of weeks," that's where I want to go. - We've already contacted managers. We're waiting for the managers to give us the okay in terms of their vacancy, so we can come with you-- - So why did I come down here today? - Well, you came down-- well, remember, we scheduled this meeting last week, and I hadn't been able to reach you all last week. - My phone's dead. - We have Monday and Tuesday to work with you this week. We thought we were going to have the entire week, maybe five or six days. - So what are we gonna do? - We'll discuss your options, and then if this is something you want to do, then we can... - We've discussed and discussed and discussed. Can't we just find an apartment? I got AIDS. I was shooting drugs behind somebody that had it, and they never told me, and I ended up catching it. Life has on me all my life, man. - Well, how are you doing? - I'm depressed a lot. About the housing thing, you know, and... - A lot of people have told me how slow and frustrating it is. But what is the holdup now? What don't they have? - I don't know. I went and did a walk-through. And, uh... - Yeah. - And then I thought I was gonna do an application on Friday, and now they're telling me I have to go do an application somewhere else. - Yeah. - Because I don't have a rental history. I've been homeless so many years... - Mm-hmm. - Because of my being-- mental health. - There's a lot of red tape in housing, but once you get it, you get it. It's kind of like a little obstacle course, but do it. - The whole trying to do things normal is... Frustrating the hell out of me because I'm not normal. - At the mercy of your moods? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, how many years have I been with mental health? Like, 43 years, and they still haven't fixed me. I ain't saying it's you, but after 43 years, you figure somebody could get it right. All right, then, now we have the Alexander... - So when am I moving in? - Hoping. - Makes no sense to me, man. You know, leave somebody sleeping on a sidewalk when he's got a apartment! Broke, homeless on the sidewalk! And he's got a roof! He's got a roof, and he can't get in it! He can't get in it! I don't understand it! I don't understand! I don't understand it! - It's a big one. - Yeah, it's nice. - It's a big one. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's a big one! Yay! - Congratulations. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. - So let me ask you a question. - Yeah. So it's a hypothetical question. How many years did your sister suffer with the symptoms of schizophrenia? - So out of those 30 years, how many of-- what percentage of that time were your family persistent in supporting her and helping her deal with those symptoms? - Yeah, and so this is society's response. When society feels like no matter what effort is put forward, what resources are put forward, this problem doesn't go away, or it only has a very minor, small impact, people get frustrated. People give up on their own family members. So if people give up on their own family members, if people ultimately give up on theirselves through suicide, what makes you think society as a whole isn't gonna give up? We were in a consultation room like this. There was the psychiatrists, my mother, my father. I think he sat over there. My sister Gail probably sat right next to me. And Merle was there, and she was so angry about being there. And she was still psychotic, and she would pace the room. Remember that, she would pace, pace, pace, pace, get anxious and pace, and rant and rave and say crazy things. And at one point, Gail and I said, "You belong here. You should be here." And she, you know, snapped at us, and said, "You belong here! You're the crazy ones!" And my mother cried a lot. And my father kept it cool, and he said, "We had enough. We're taking her out of here." - I do remember him saying, "Never, never do that ever again. "Never-- it's my daughter, and you're not to do anything like that ever again." With him, it was shame. I think there's a lot of shame regarding mental illness with him. - I think he thought he was doing the right thing. I don't think anyone really, you know, thought they were destroying her life. It was at that moment, at 14 years old, when my parents took my sister out of the hospital against medical advice, that I decided to become a psychiatrist. Merle was my first best friend... Took me to my first scary movie... Sung me to sleep. As a child, Merle also had signs of mental illness. She had periods of disabling anxiety and depression. And it might have changed everything if Merle had gotten professional help early on. - I'm gonna ask you what might seem like a strange question. Do you ever have an experience of hearing voices in your head? Do you ever hear people talking to you that aren't really there? - My head tells me to run away. - Your head tells you to run away? Is it a voice, or you just think that in your head? - Voice. - A voice? Every study shows that the earlier you intervene with a kid and a family, the better the outcome. The voice told you to go in the kitchen and cut yourself. Was it a weekend or a weekday, do you remember? - Weekend, I think in the weekend. - Was it, like, in the morning? Was it in the afternoon? Was it in the evening? There are a total of ten county inpatient adolescent psychiatric beds available in Los Angeles County at any given time. Parents are stuck with this very difficult decision. "Do I want to take my suicidal kid back home "and watch him 24/7, "or do I want to leave my kid in an ER "for three or four or five days while they're looking for a bed?" She stated, quote, "All day, I have been feeling sad "and thinking of suicide and running away from home. "I would choke myself, drown myself, or use drugs to hurt myself." Did you really try to drown yourself before? - Yeah, but I couldn't because I, like, won't, and I was kind of scared. - Were you aware that she had tried to drown herself in the past? - No. - Just the-- - I heard it the first time today. - You get bullied at school? You feel like it's difficult for you to sometimes ignore your anger? Okay. And so when you get angry, you feel like killing yourself? - You did mention a couple of times some kids told you some stuff, but I told you, "Just ignore it," you know? But I didn't know it was that serious for you. - I mean, anytime an 11-year-old says that they want to kill themself and has multiple plans in which to do so, and has tried to kill themself in the past, it's very serious. Suicide is the number three cause of death in adolescents and early adolescents her age. - You know I love you. You may think sometimes-- you think I don't love you, but I do. You always question that. I don't know why. - She's going home. I'm gonna discontinue her whole-- - That's Delilah, right? - Delilah. So Alvarez is going to Bakersfield? And then why don't we put on this one home with Mom? - You said Delilah? - Yeah, Delilah home with Mom. After the first time, it didn't solve anything. I was still emotionally unstable, so kind of got worse because at school, the problems continued and I didn't know how to cope with them. I tried committing overdose, and thank God nothing happened. That's when he sent me to the hospital. And they sent me to therapy and everything, and so everything is better now. I have two medications. One is for my anxiety. I take that one daily, and the other one is for depression. So it's whenever I'm-- it's to, like, control my feelings and, yeah, emotions. She worked! It's been very hard. I try to be strong, but there were points that I would just-- I'd be driving back from work, and I would just start crying because, I mean, it's like, you know, sometimes you feel like you don't have the strength. But I just ask God to give me the strength to keep going, and how best I can help her. You know, you think you have your--the normal child, you know, and then something like this happens, and, like, what happened? What did I miss? What did I do wrong, you know? But other kids just don't get it on time, and they just--they're gone. - Delilah... So, Monte, when did you realize that you a mental illness? - When I was 20 years old, and I started, you know, seeing people, you know, ears are getting pointy. I felt like everybody was after me. I felt like people were talking about me, and I was just like, "Wait, something's not right here." And I said, "Why is my mind thinking like this? This is just abstract. This isn't normal." ♪ Black life, it matters here ♪ ♪ Black life, it matters here ♪ - You should turn it up. ♪ Black life, it matters here ♪ ♪ Black life, it matters here ♪ Soon after I got to know Patrisse, she took me along on a vigil on behalf of a young man who had been fatally shot by the police. An LAPD officer, they say, shot and killed their mentally challenged son, 25-year-old Ezell Ford, Jr. - They laid him out, and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back. More than half of the folks who are being shot and killed by police have some sort of mental health issues. We know that Ezell Ford in Los Angeles, who the cops knew had psychiatric issues, shot and gunned down in his own neighborhood. My brother, Monte, who's had run-ins with law enforcement for a very long time, he's a part of a pattern of harming, abusing, and often killing Black people with severe mental illness. - A lot of bad things have happened. You know, I guess, they look, "Oh, he's a big, you know, Black guy, and he looks dangerous, so we'll treat him that way." But that's the opposite. I'm--you know, I don't-- I've been very few fights, you know, in my life, and that's because I chose-- I chose that. My hope is that we're going to intervene in the way Los Angeles treats the mentally ill, specifically that sort of cross section between mental health and incarceration. You have to have lofty ideas and lofty dreams. - No justice! - No peace! - No justice! - No peace! - There are currently 3,300 beds right now for the mentally ill inside of these jails. That's a problem. Ain't no power like the power of the people because the power of the people don't stop. During the second year of filming, Patrisse co-founded a new civil rights organization that would become a national movement. Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! - For every single Black life in this room and every single Black life on this planet, how are we going to save Black lives? Pretty much all my activism, especially around police violence, especially around mass incarceration, is for my brother. If this were cancer, there'd be a revolution in this country. This is an issue that is a civil rights issue. It's about the discrimination against our brothers and sisters, simply because of the immutable fact their illness is an illness of the brain as opposed to an illness of any other organ in the body. This is not complicated. Treat mental illness the same as every other illness, and we will make enormous difference in tackling the challenges that face us. And there shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican out there who says no to the agenda that you take up to Capitol Hill today. And she had schizophrenia; she thought bugs were crawling under her skin. And we ran to the ER, and they basically ran to Bellevue and they said, "Well, we have no beds, and she's not danger." We ran to Gracie Square Hospital. "We have no beds. She's not dangerous." We ran to Beth Israel Hospital. "We have no beds. She's not dangerous." She wasn't sick enough for them to admit her. - I got a nuisance ordinance from the City of Bedford Police. They were out at the house before we came home... - 52 times. - And on the first call, they laughed at my son. They thought it was funny, his mental illness. - Even the emergency room. - And they had been at our house 50-some times! This was nothing new to them. My son was now considered a nuisance. A few days later, five days later, they came out and they killed him. - They murdered him. - They over-Tased him so many times. They changed their Taser reports. There's no accountability for these guys at all. He always looked at me to help him. On that day, I just couldn't save him 'cause they got in the way. Anybody want some chopped liver? This is a very precious moment in the Rosenberg family. Mama, what are you gonna say to the camera? - Uh, hello there, hi! My loving family was as close and open as can be, but there was one secret that could not be shared. - Hi! - Smile for the camera! - How you doing? - Wonderful! And I want to tell you, it's my pleasure that you all came here today. I've been dreaming about this. A few years after she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, my sister heard voices in her head and jumped out of her bedroom window. Merle was found by the neighbors. She had broken nearly every bone in her body. My mom and dad told everyone that an intruder had entered the house and was going to attack her, and Merle went out the window to escape. My heartbroken parents dedicated their lives to getting Merle to walk again. But her mental illness was never to be discussed, and when my parents and my sister Gail died, I was left in charge of Merle. I hired doctors and social workers. She fired them. My family's house, now Merle's house, was falling apart and becoming unlivable. Whenever I came to the house, she locked me out. In December 2005, I told her, "You must move out. I need to get you help." After two weeks of her not answering the phone, I finally called the police. They found her dead in her bed at the age of 55 years old. I never intended to share my family's story. I never intended to go back home. But I now realize we can't fix something that we can't face. I wish I knew what really happened. I really don't know how to make sense of it all, honestly. I really don't. - There may be things that you never figure out, you know? You might never know. - She would sit on this bed and write reams and reams of paper, and, you know, write to the devil and write to Rufus, who was the spirit who possessed her. And, you know-- and I'm sure that's what happened when she jumped out the window. She was just so-- so deluged by voices and ideas that were so scary. And when she died... I didn't feel a whole lot of, um... Anything. And it very much bothers me. I wish I could've made it better for my sister. I really do. - You did everything you could. I know you did. - Well, I don't know. I just wish there was a happier ending to her life and to my entire family's life. - Oh, just be careful not to let the cat out. There we go. I call her Mellow Yellow 'cause her eyes-- like, whenever I get too manic, I say, "Okay, I got to mellow yellow." So yeah, I went in the hospital, and then feeling better, and that's what's hard, is it's like you can feel pretty normal for a while, but then you just relapse. But I always thought it was the medication, but it's actually the illness, I guess. So that's-- when I'm finally after, like, five or six years of this, is finally coming around to. I would like to get my degree. I would love to, further down the line, have a family, but I would like to have my degree to have a job to be able to support myself. That would just be so amazing, but it feels out of reach. But, um... I, you know, um... I would like to get to that. I just remember when this first happened to me, how alone and scared I was. And it was just the loneliest feeling. You just felt like this freak, and you didn't know anything about it, and it was just-- it would've been nice to have known that other people are like this, you know? And now I know if you have this, you're not alone. Monte finished a year of treatment ordered by the court. He was taking medication, in therapy, and had a job for the first time in years. - What's up, dawg? I know Jesse. Yeah, I know you, dawg! - Yeah, man! I haven't seen you in almost over 20 years, maybe. - That's one of your little boys? Looks just like you. - My son, man. You know I'm on the radio, man. - Okay, yeah, yeah! Not everybody that has a mental illness is a monster. Have people treated you like a monster? Yeah, basically, yes. Like, "Oh, there goes that guy; he's a bad guy. "Oh, he did this and that because he had a mental illness." That's what, you know, my life story is. I just want to just live and be happy and just be left alone, you know? - Monte, I got your number. - All right, Jesse. - I'm gonna text you. - All right. Cool, cool. - So you can have mine, okay? - All right. Be safe. All rise. Recognize the principles for which we stand. Department 126 of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles is now in session. Please be seated and come to order. Good morning, Your Honor. - Good morning. - Okay. Todd was arrested. Unlike Monte, his case was heard in a criminal court. - The court has had an in-camera review. The proceedings are sealed, and discovery will be turned over by 4:25. - And, Your Honor, I would also like to ask for OR full release on compassionate grounds, as his T-cell count has plummeted to the double digits during his time of incarceration. This is a non-violent offense. His strikes are over. Bail is set at $10,000, and he lacks the 10 % premium to get himself out of jail. - I'm sorry, but you got a strike on your history. I'm not inclined to release you at this point. - Well, how many years do I have to pay for that? How many times do I have to pay for that? - You will have to have to your attorney about that. Okay, the request is denied. Matter is continued to May 4, 2016. I don't think any police officer or DA can explain to me why a guy who's supposedly doing hand-to-hand drug sales in an amount less than $10 is a menace to the public safety, why he needs to spend over three months in jail while he awaits his trial. His health has plummeted since he's been inside. His T-cell count is now in the double digits. Basically, the system provides him just enough so that he won't die on their watch, but that's about it. After three months in jail, Todd lost his apartment. This is "Eyewitness News." - Hundreds of protesters shut down a busy downtown Los Angeles street. Why they put homemade jail cots in front of the supervisor's office. The 100 replica jail beds we've created are a far cry from the upwards of 6,000 the county is trying to build. We can't get well in a cell! People with severe mental illness deserve care. Holding people and warehousing them in jail cells is not gonna be the way. We have historically not fought for people with mental illness. - We've got $3.5 million-- People are rising up and saying, "We are sick and tired of our families being thrown away, being disposable." We have to be a part of a growing movement trying to change the course of history. No more jails! No more jails! - We've run into contradictions where custody and penalization takes priority over care and treatment. Mental health conditions, medical conditions, they're not well served in custody settings, so community-based care is really what we can do to heal. Thank you. - Thank you. No clapping from the auditorium. If you agree with what they're saying, you can always put your hands in the air, raise the roof. Next speaker, please. - As you know, my brother, Monte, suffers from serious mental illness. There has been no adequate treatment for him or people like him in Los Angeles. It's been criminalization and incarceration. We need a radical shift in the mental health care in Los Angeles. No dollars should be spent on a facility that locks away human beings who are suffering, who are sick. Do this right. Do not compromise. Support the Montes of Los Angeles now. - Next speaker, please. - My name is Colin Dias. I served for ten years as a Chief of the Department of Psychiatry at LAC+USC Medical Center and seven years as the Chief of Emergency Psychiatric Services there. We are at an inflection point in the treatment of the mentally ill. You must change the paradigm. - There are people like me who sit here as proof that treatment and care, instead of jail, work. There are stories and stories and stories of thousands of people. - Last year, I lost a family member to the effects of mental illness. - Every time that my brother has been taken away, he's given back to us in pieces. - We've been coming here for seven years, saying, "No more jail." One year ago, we came here, saying, "No more jail," and today we say, "No more jail. Facilities of compassion for our people." - Thank you. Next speaker, please. - Imagine a place of care. Imagine a place of well-being when you've needed that. - And I beg you to consider expanding existing community services, looking at intensive community-based models that are recuperative in nature, enhancing those-- - I believe that this county has an opportunity to be a model for the country, to put people first. - I want to thank everyone in the audience who's been fighting for almost a decade to get us to this point. - Supervisor Kuehl, aye. - Supervisor Barger? - No. - Supervisor Barger, no. Supervisor Hahn? - Aye. - Supervisor Hahn, aye. Motion carries, four-to-one. - Whoo! Today on "Eyewitness Newsmakers," a major turning point: the LA County Board of Supervisors will not build a new jail. Mental health treatment will replace it, a landmark change. - We won. Monte! - Yeah? - We won! - Are you being serious? We get to dream big now. Monte, we're gonna save a lot of lives. A lot of lives. - Okay, it's a very busy day today. Today is July 4th. All the beds in the community for inpatient psych are all filled, so we're gonna get everything under the sun this afternoon, this evening. - So I'm gonna help you guys for a few hours. Let me help you knock these notes out. Is there anybody in particular that is more complicated that I can help with? - No. - No. - I think I signed up for those. - All right. - Are you DC'ing him or keeping him? - No, no, he's-- he's history of agitation. Family brought him in. - Okay. - So your last day in the ER is August 1st. Is that gonna be a day of joy or a day of sadness? Yeah. - So has your experience here in the ER left you, um, drained? - Yes. - So you wonder how anyone could do this on a continuous basis, correct? - I don't wonder. I know people do it. I just have my limits. I'm quitting because it's a workload that's not manageable. My responsibility has to be to being the best doctor I can be. So I sort of developed a way to cope. It's just gone on too long. As long as doctors tolerate these working conditions and the outside world won't know what's going on or understand what's going on, then nothing will ever get better. The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different results. The way we treat mentally ill in this country is insane. - Good night. - Good night. To not have access to regular food, housing, medication, medical care-- it doesn't make for a good American story. ♪♪
