TEST Im disappointed in your species The human species Other planets that I've created in the solar system are doing very well They respect their species And the natural environment Why are the humans failing? I've given them everything I've given them everything Everything You're crazy! Think I'm crazy? I'm so fucking high I want you so bad I really don't need to Holy shit! We've gone to heaven Your weapons can not harm me Have we died and gone to heaven? Are we in heaven? No this is not heaven This is not the way I intended my experiment In creating this planet And this human species to go I'm disappointed in your species That's why I'm here Let's get the hell out of here! Run! I've had to freeze you and make you disappear But it's only temporary Humans have taken far too long to understand solar energy But they are beginning to make progress now They think they may have an opportunity to use it now But they are in for a surprise The country is finally seriously adressing sustainability And respecting the planets natural ressources I'm so excited to be working here! We're finally producing results generating solar power as well as wind-turbine power generation The engineering research on thermal power is doing the same The younger generation will have a sustainable energy system to look forward to Corrupt corporations Criminals on Wall Street Greedy politicians Lying lawyers and insurance companies Are destroying what I had planned for this planet I will eliminate them all If the humans can not Or will not, on their own Now that we've payed off our fellow elective representatives in the legislature That environmental solar panel development bill Will fail next week Not to mention the cash it will put in our pockets The country has done without solar and wind power until now They can wait a few more years It's more profitable to be without those sustainable energy systems at this time The country has known for years that the corporations and certainly the politicians Don't have the insight or the vision To create sustainable energy systems They think there might be an opportunity for that to happen But they're in for a surprise Our network of connections, technology pay-offs and greed will never let it happen It will take a power greater than ours to get rid of us! And clean up the systems and manage the environmental ressources of this planet the way they were intended [Banter] I'm so sorry but due to the poor economy, we're going have to lay you off Along with some other staff members We all had the best of intentions of improving the nations sustainable energy systems and environment but The corruption and greed and big business and government just won't let it happen We're all very disappointed It's always the government and lawyers that prevent progress Don't give up Don't give up! You can make a difference! Don't give up I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't believe I was laid off We were doing some of the most important ecological work with that company The research we were doing was going to solve everybody's energy problems and we couldn't get government support! They're not going to hire anybody of us back at this point and I have this "baby" How am I going to support her if I'm all alone? You'll find something You're my "twin" sister! You're pretty and smart You're hot! We're hot! There's no way though I'm going to find anything half as interesting Especially in this economy Become a stripper! An escort! You'd be great at that! You'd just have to give up your... Shut the fuck up! There's no way I'm going to become a stripper I'm a mother I have a baby! You may not have a choice Look I have someone I can hook you up with Just to get you started And you can lie to everyone, like all the other girls do They tell their friends that they're in various forms of business but they really are not they're strippers or escorts! It's their big secret in sin city I'm getting kind of desperate Waouw! Waouw! The humans still have not developped a justice system that punishes the guilty and protects the innocent Hey, I've got the new girl to work for us Very hot I'd like to do any of these two guys at the same time What? Hell yeah! I'll do her! Damn! "Twins"! I get her first!

Don't cut off my ear! No! No! Don't cut off my hand! We want you to act surprised and shocked And when the federal investigation begins you don't know anything about how it may have happened Anything you say Anything you say Oh by the way I'd like to arrange for a thank-you gift To be given to you later today Welcome to our world Double my pleasure Thank-you Thank-you for the gift It will be well worth it Now that we've paid off our fellow elective representatives in the legislature That environmental solar panel development bill Will fail next week Argh! The hell man? That's just not right Let me help you I don't feel so good Cancer chemo is kicking my ass! I always wanted to see this before I died I only have a month to live [Excitement] Stop fucking around Leave him alone We have business to do This is Erik Our European distributor for anything outside of the country I can get you anything your customers want!

This isn't the way I planned your species You two are worthless I'm sorry, we have to lay you off We're all so sorry I don't understand how could they let this happen Sustainable energy systems are our future It's all about money. Corporately. I'm sure this is only a temporary delay This is not a temporary delay, it's more politics and corporate greed They've been trying to develop sustainable and solar systems for 30 years now and nothing has happened They're lying to us Just like they're lying about trying to find cures for cancer and other diseases They could find a cure if they wanted to It's more profitable not to find any cures We're all so sorry You sure are Now I've lost my job, and I won't be able to find another one I'm an environmental activist! And it's getting me nowhere! The politicans and society still have no interest nor money to help improve the environment They should be capitalising on the development of solar power wind and energy fuel efficient systems They could care less about living with nature, not damaging the planet They're all so greedy and money oriented and I'm so passionate about this! You're unemployed too? What are you gonna do? I don't know This fucking sucks, but we'll think of something I'll become a full time hooker or stripper and not tell him the truth I'll tell him I got a part-time job at the mall Don't worry babe, we'll be ok I'm scared I'll become a car thief and not tell her the truth I'll tell her I got a part-time job at the factory I think I know him that face Excuse me!

Go Learn to love yourself. Other humans and humanity You have so much to offer nature, and this planet I know you from somewhere Help me! Save me! You can save yourself!
