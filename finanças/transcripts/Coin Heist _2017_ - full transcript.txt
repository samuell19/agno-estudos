[POP MUSIC PLAYING] JASON: I get it. I messed up. That doesn't mean that I shouldn't, you know, at least attempt to fix it. Even though I can't go back and change exactly how it is that I got there. I'm trying to say that I can't fail this time. So, basically the essence of what... You know, trying to sound smart can sometimes work in reverse. I'm not trying to sound smart, I just... Jason, I'm not gonna change your grade. Just a little? Like, temporarily. If you want to pass bio, do what any of us do and study. Alice. I'm not gonna feel sorry for the spoiled headmaster's kid, but if you want to try some other computer nerd, good luck. All right, gather around. Design students, come on. Bring it in, we're gonna see some coins. Come on, guys, please listen to Mr. Rankin. MR. RANKIN: Hey, Dakota, Dylan... come be in love over here. Thank you. All right, we're gonna go in, we're gonna use our inside voices, we're gonna be super respectful, really jazzed about coins, and we're gonna show them what kind of school Dennington Prep is. - JASON: Shitty one? - MR. RANKIN: Jason. All right, guys, let's go. Let's please enter the building in a calm and orderly fashion. MR. RANKIN: Are you guys excited? Follow me. Let's not dillydally. These coins are gonna... Good behavior, Jason. [DETECTOR BEEPS] You're fine. Don't forget to take a pamphlet. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Okay, guys. Mr. Garcia here is the operations manager, but he also happens to be my cousin. So, be cool. Here at the U.S. Mint, we are big fans of thorough design. In fact, I'm willing to bet that most of you have a few of our best designs in your own pockets. Do you guys make credit cards? Uh... - No... - 'Cause I only use credit cards. No. You make quarters and stuff. - Oh, my God. - MR. GARCIA: Quarters and stuff, yes. - We press... - I'm still not changing your grade, Jason. On an operational day. - Shall we start the tour? - Yes. MR. GARCIA: Congress passed something called the Coinage Act in 1792, but I'm betting... - Hey. - What did Jason Hodges want? Nothing. Wait, he didn't try to ask you out, did he? - Oh, my God. Shut up, Greg. - [CHUCKLES] No, you're right, that would be way too weird. You're not one of those Jason Hodges type of girls anyway. And what exactly is a Jason Hodges type girl? You know, like, um... no makeup, effortlessly gorgeous, uh, does well at parties... You're more of a "no makeup, uh", I don't care what people think about me, I'd rather be at home gaming" type girl. Thanks, Greg. American State Quarters series. It's similar to that, but set in the wild as opposed to state-by-state specific. Oh, he just asked me to change his grade for him, and I said no. Okay, of course he asked you to change his grade. Is that all people think we do? You know, I have a very important computer science project due fourth period and I'm stuck on this field trip. Speaking of that, I actually have it on my phone if you want to look. - GREG: Yeah. - Are you serious? A federal building with a WEP-encrypted Wi-Fi network? - That's cute. - What a joke. The coins are then heated in an annealing furnace in order to soften the metal for upsetting, striking and washing. But here is where the magic begins. With highly-skilled artists who mold and finesse the artwork which will eventually be stamped onto each coin using one of these dies. It's that simple. Now, I've got a question for the class. Sometimes our inspectors will catch a flaw in a finished coin. Now, when that happens, the coin has to be scrapped. Every now and then, one of them gets out. It can be very lucrative for coin collectors. What do you imagine would be the cause of an error coin on a mechanical level? Go ahead, Benny. Well, if there's no metal for the dies to stamp, wouldn't they clash together? Yes. I'd imagine the machines are strong enough so that they would actually damage the dies, and any coins that get stamped after that would have clash marks on them. Well done. No one ever gets the answer right. What, are you looking for extra credit? - [SOFTLY] Stop it. - MR. GARCIA: Okay. You know what? At this moment, I'd like to open the floor to questions. If anything I've said is confusing, or if you'd like me to expand... I think it's very... - James Hodges? - Yes. We're going to need you to come with us, sir. Dad? [SIGHS] I can't leave right now, I'm on a field trip with students. - OFFICER: We're not asking. - All right, can I just... That's my son. Can I have a word with my son, please? - JASON: What's going on? - No. - [STAMMERS] Officer... - No. - What's going on? - [STAMMERING] Jason, just call Mom. - Hey, hey, hey! - It's all right. Just call your mother, Jason. Call Mom. MR. GARCIA: Please, no phones or video allowed in the Mint. MR. RANKIN: Okay, phones down. Eyes on Mr. Garcia. Okay. - Stop it. - MR. RANKIN: Phones down, everyone. We're gonna continue the tour. Mom. Mom, uh... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Dad just got arrested. They're at school, too. They've canceled classes and everything. - MR. RANKIN: Okay... that's enough. - I don't know. - DAKOTA: What's going on? - I don't know. We're gonna continue the tour. Oh... You think they'll make us go back to school? [MR. SMERCONISH SIGHS] Ten million dollars. You have to understand our situation. Sarah, were you aware... your husband was embezzling from the endowment? MRS. HODGES: No, of course not. MR. SMERCONISH: No. No, of course not. I'm sorry, I had to ask. [SIGHS] Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt your, um... - Kung Pao chicken. - Yeah. But I just wanted to let you both know that we're gonna take care of this. It's gonna be okay. We'll talk tomorrow. - Have a good night, Harold. - Yes. He has to think about the board, Jason. He's a dick. Mr. Smerconish is trying to help us. He's been trying to help the school for years. Just like Dad. Yeah. Just like Dad. He's not guilty. He could never have done this. - Benny? - Mmm-hmm? - Great. - Thanks. Well, I like it. Nobody likes it. I guess I'm no one, then. JASON: My dad says it's a symbol. It's part of his... big plan to make this school matter again. It's just an expensive blob of metal. Isn't it supposed to be a fountain of knowledge? Or a wave of bright, shining futures? Isn't that what he said at the unveiling assembly? Either way, I like it. Alice, watcha workin' on? A new commemorative coin rendering. Great. Great. Jason, project? Yes, no, maybe? All of the above. Hodges, I know it's rough dealing with what your dad did and all, but do not blow this off. You're better than that. I asked to make this announcement today because I thought you would appreciate hearing from a student, someone who believes just as much as you guys do that extracurriculars and clubs are the heart of Dennington Prep. But as president of six after-school clubs, I am very sorry to announce that we have been forced to suspend all student activities due to compromised funding. - Clubs will be the first to go. - [MURMURING] This includes the following. Ant Farming, Architecture, Birding, Chess, Checkers, Chinese, Chinese Checkers, Community Service, Creative Writing, Ethics, Film Views, Gardening, Inkwell, Math Team, Mock Trial, Queer Straight Alliance, Robotics, Spanish Language Immersion, Stock Market Watchers, Theater, Young Democrats, and Young Republicans. So all we have are classes now? Everything is canceled, except for Yearbook, Newspaper, and the Winter Formal. - [SCATTERED MURMURING] - DAKOTA: And also... - Also... [SIGHS] - [MURMURING CONTINUES] [STUTTERS] There will still be some major cutbacks to those areas as well. Unfortunately... the Winter Formal will be held in our cafeteria this year. - [ALL CLAMORING] - Which is not as bad of a space. It's not actually as bad as you think it is. Guys, it's gonna be sorted out. We're gonna be fine. Everything will be taken care of. - I'm so sorry. - [CLAMORING CONTINUES] What are you doing in here? You were supposed to be at the assembly. The one about how my dad ruined the school? No, thank you. I'm looking for guitar strings. I left some in here last week. That reminds me, we can't afford a real band to play Formal, so we're gonna need your band to play. My band's real. Right. I just need to know if you can do it, Jay. [SOFTLY] I don't know. Your dad is the one that got us into this mess. Are you really gonna say no? Fine, yeah. Yeah, we'll do it. Well, is that a... a real commitment or is that a Jason Hodges commitment? How long are you gonna hold that over my head? It's been over a year now, okay? I get it. You're perfect. You never made a mistake before. Dated you. Trust me, I'm everybody's mistake. Join the club. I can't, they're all canceled. The cafeteria? Are you kidding me? Maybe it could be lunch themed. Guys, the committee met for three hours trying to figure this out. There's no other option. Whatever. Thanks for canceling Chinese Checkers Club. I didn't cancel anything. You know what? I have to check something. I'll see you later. [GASPS] Oh. Hi. Hi. Good, uh, assembly. Seriously? What do you have to complain about? It's not like they canceled football. I was just saying you did a good job with all those people yelling and everything. Oh. - Yeah. - Thanks. [DYLAN CHUCKLES] - DYLAN: There he is. - ETHAN: Hey, man. You know, we're gonna try to sell this thing. Get our parents' money back. How does your dad like it in jail? Gimme one of those. Nice one. Jason... [SIGHS] we need to talk. Ooh... Screw you, Dylan. I don't need you to feel bad for me. I don't, remember? I told you yesterday. But I want to help. I think I can help. You can't, okay? Unless you have ten million dollars. We should go somewhere to talk. So, you know I've hacked into some places before? Uh, yeah, like grades and stuff, right? Yeah, and some other stuff too. Like what? Front office, school district... - Google, IBM... - [STAMMERS] TSA, NASA. - Are you serious? - Yes, but I didn't steal anything. I just wanted to see if I could get in, and I did. Anyway, when we were at the Mint, I noticed a few things. Their internal security is ridiculously outdated and anyone could get into their corporate network with just... I'm not stealing money from anybody, especially not the U.S. government. Okay, well, if you are looking to save Dennington, your options are kind of limited, legally. Why do you care so much about this? I thought you hated me. I don't know. I guess I kind of know what it's like to have parents who do shitty things. You... I saw the way people were looking at you and talking about you just because of what they think your dad did. I thought you might want to prove them wrong. But I guess not. "Bertrand Academy, New Hampshire." Yeah. We spoke with the admissions director. If we send your transcripts and your test scores this week, she said she could schedule an interview. You shouldn't have to give up your dreams over this. My dreams? Yes, your professional aspirations, dear. Well, not that it matters much now... but, um... I got cast as the lead in our school musical today. - Wow, that's terrific, honey. - Oh! Lovely. Anyway, the thing about a school like Bertrand is, they have a rigorous maths program... What about Philadelphia High School for Performing Arts? For what? All right, come on. Let's talk about this seriously. It's close enough to Brown that you can even see your sister on the weekends. Yeah, you can see Steph. Stephanie said that she would look into an internship for you through her journalism program. The Herald, right? - Daily Herald. She loved that. - The Daily Herald. Great job. I cannot believe that you talked to her before you talked to me. Well, I wanted her input. What about my input? It's my life! You can't just send me four states away and expect my perfect sister to fix me. We never said she would fix... I'm tired of student council and all the clubs that I run, and everything that I have to do and be responsible for every day. - But you're so good at it, Dakota. - Hon... this spot at Bertrand is not gonna stay open forever. We need to think seriously about this. And I'm sure they have, um, some kind of art... Of course they do. Of course they do. We should get on this right away. [GAMBIT PLAYING ON TV] MICHAEL CAINE: It can't fail. It's absolutely foolproof. JOHN ABBOTT: If it works the way you think it will work. MICHAEL CAINE: It works. They'll write us up in books. We'll be historical. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] MRS. HODGES: Jason, are you doing your homework? Yeah, don't worry about it. I watched twelve heist movies. In three days? That's not the point. The point is that we can do this. What? Do you know what that is? [BENNY BLOWS] I don't know, why? It's an alarm that I was making for my room, - but I was hoping if I handed it to you... - [ALARM BLARING] You'd start playing with it and I could probably use it to prove a point. Give me that. [ALARM CONTINUES BLARING] - [ALARM STOPS] - Oh... Good work, Benny. Hodges, you are not in this class. Get out of here. We need Benny. Need me for what? How were you able to do that so fast? I work in my uncle's garage on the weekends. Idiots set off their own car alarms all the time. Funny. So you know how to work on machines? I'm a pretty decent mechanic, if that's what you're asking. What would you say to a mechanic-related job? One that can save the school? [INHALES DEEPLY] Ten million dollar car repair? I didn't say anything about cars. Sounds illegal. TEACHER: I mean it. Out. All of the heist movies that I watched had a team. I don't think we can do this alone. What about Dakota Cunningham? She's smart. No, don't even think about it. Don't even think about what? Nothing. Go away. I know what's going on here. - You do? - And I'm shutting it down. Ms. Coyle said that we have to be off campus by 4:15. You can't create your own club when everyone else had to cancel theirs. - It's just not fair. - [SCOFFS] - Well, why don't you hear out what... - Alice. Ms. Coyle gave you a little bit of authority, and now you're running around school like you're in charge of everything. We're just sitting here, studying. Go. Do you want to help us figure out how to steal ten million dollars? Excuse me, what? [STAMMERING] We're not stealing. We're... making. Yeah. We're going to break into... the Mint, print a few coins and, um... We're gonna rebuild the school's endowment. Gah. Dakota, where are you going? I'm talking to Ms. Coyle. I can't believe you'd do this. Listen, I'm sorry that I was such a shitty boyfriend. I'm sorry that I got stoned and I forgot to take you to that audition. I'm sorry for that. I'm sorry for so many things right now, I don't even know where to begin. I'm just trying to fix it. Okay? Hey, Dakota. Will they be serving, uh, lunch at the lunch-themed dance? [ALL CHUCKLE] - I want in. - What? JASON: Of course you do. This is not an opportunity to just boss us around. Okay. I'll just leave and go tell Ms. Coyle about this whole conversation... Okay, stop talking. You want to help? What can you do? What's your thing? Alibis, planning, covers. You know how serious I am about organization. JASON: Yeah, I do. She used to color code our entire dating schedule. - Mmm. - It was horrible. Thoughtful. It was very thoughtful. I also act, so I have access to the theater wardrobe department, for anything that we need as far as covers go. - You act? - I just got cast in My Fair Lady. Congrats. Don't worry, it just got canceled. I wonder why. You know what? I think this is gonna work. But there is one thing that you have to do first. Do you know Benny from the football team? Benny, do you have a second? Yeah. [CLICKS TONGUE] I had a meeting with the bursar's office this morning, and in light of everything that's happened, it looks like the D.M. Jamison athletic scholarship... [SIGHS] is going to be discontinued. - But I was promised that money. - I know. I kept my GPA up, I had a great season. I know the team doesn't need me right now... No, look, Benny, Benny, Benny, you're not the only one. When I know more, you'll know more. More what? Reasons to kick out the poor kids? It's not about that. Hey. I needed to talk to you. Yeah, it's like the other day where it was weird and awkward, and I yelled at you. - Did I ever apologize for that? - No. I'm sorry. Anyway, um.... [CHUCKLES] I, uh, saw on your schedule that you have practice after school, so I was just hoping to catch you. You know my schedule? Well, I wanted to speak to you about Jason and Alice... Seriously... [SIGHS] no thanks. Wait. You know more about machines than anyone else in this school. You know that you're the only person getting an A in robotics? I might've looked at your grades, too. I'm sorry. Listen, I didn't leave my old school to come get arrested here for some dumb illegal plan the headmaster's kid came up with. School means too much to me. I get it. But you might not have a school to go to if we don't do something about it. We need you. [BAND PLAYING ROCK MUSIC] ♪ And you sit all alone again ♪ ♪ Well, I don't care ♪ ♪ I think I got What everybody's lookin' for ♪ Sorry to interrupt. Jason... visiting hours are almost over. You can go without me. Well, it'd be another week. I know. I would, we just... We have practice. Okay. I thought you said you didn't like Jason Hodges. He's fine. We're working on a project together. Okay. Whoa, hold on. So, first you cancel on Friday night gaming, and now you're dropping out of lunch lab for some project? It's not, like, a thing. We just have a deadline. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I see what it is. What? His dad's in jail. All of a sudden he's got no friends, so where does he turn? He turns to you for some reason. And you think it's good. You think, "Cool, Jason Hodges is my friend now." But next thing you know, you're gonna start smoking marijuana cigarettes and playing cowbell in his band. Greg, you are so weird. Relax. Okay, yeah, but just don't blame me when you find out that he's using you. Okay? To him, you're just a computer nerd. You're just someone he can get a grade change from if he's nice enough to you. That is so mean. Shut up. He does have dreamy eyes, though. Yeah. I bet you just fall right into them, don't you? You know what? I can't do next week either, Greg. Fine. Friday night gaming is permanently canceled. Fine. I gotta go. What, is he on to us? No, he's just an idiot. So what are we doing? Glad you changed your mind. Yeah. Okay, this is what I have so far about error coins. Hey. Are you guys working on your project during lunch? Yeah. Um... This is the only time we can meet for our study group. Your study group? For art class. Well, it is the most difficult art class in the whole school. It's the only art class in the school, Jason. And maybe if you study, you'll get a passing grade. - This is cool. - Um... [STUTTERS] We have a lot to finish before lunch is over, so... Carry on. Okay, we definitely have to find a new place to meet. I've got a place we can go after school. It's not around here, though. So, we can come here after school, after my uncle closes up the shop. Just, uh, make yourselves at home, I guess. [MACHINE WHIRRS] Just don't touch anything unless I say you can. Please. Okay. What's your big plan, Jay? Thank you. Okay, uh, so, in 2004, there was a so-called error coin that surfaced in Tucson and San Antonio. It was a Wisconsin state quarter. It had, like, an extra leaf on the cornstalk. - So, you want to replicate it? - Not exactly. Later on, they looked into the scientific makeup of the coin, and figured out that the error was done on purpose. How could that happen? Well, in between the final heat treat and die hubbing, the die metal is actually soft enough that if you have the right tools, you can make a couple little changes. If we get a die from one of the most recent state quarters... Such as the Wildlife of Michigan state quarter, which, according to that pamphlet, is set to begin production in early March. - You wanna see it? - Yeah. We can make an alteration. Maybe an extra fin on that fish. ALICE: Yeah. What would that go for? We could probably sell them for, like, $5,000 each. We could make 2,000 coins. That's, like, 25 pounds. Okay, so we can definitely carry 25 pounds. But how are we gonna convince coin collectors that they're worth $5,000 each? Well, I haven't worked all of it out yet. ALICE: But once he does, we'd be able to make back half the endowment in six months, which is enough to keep the school open for at least another year. I will figure out how to get them onto the market. There are so many steps between now and then. First of all, we need a real staff ID from the Mint. Once we have that, we can get in and set this thing up for real. I have an idea. Will you get off your phone? [STAMMERS] Why? What are you doing? - Give me the phone. Get off it. - Hey. Get off the phone. [BOTH STRUGGLING] - It's expensive. - Excuse me? Hi. Hello. I'm Jenna McNeil. I'm with the Brown Daily Herald. I have an appointment with Mr. Garcia. Are you doing an article on the Mint? Yes, actually, I am. Think we might be in it? Um... Maybe. That is exciting. Go on through. Thank you. Uh... Hold on. What did you say your name was again? Jenna McNeil. - Um, I have an appointment at 12:30. - You don't want her to be late... No, we didn't hear anything about a reporter coming in today. Glen, you don't want her writing that everything in the Mint was great except for us, okay? Go on through. Let me know if you need a quote... GLEN: I still need to see an ID. Right. Of course. Hey, are you with the college newspaper? Yes, I am. All right. It's okay, guys. She's with me. Called yesterday about doing an interview. - Yeah, but we got protocol here... - Glen, it's fine. - Come on through. - Thank you. I'll take you across the production floor. So, uh, does the article you're writing have a specific angle you're looking to emphasize? Or are you just writing a general piece about the Mint? Oh, we just want to know more about how coins influence the world around us. Fantastic. That's a great subject for an article, certainly. Uh... now, you can't take any photographs of the production floor, but, uh, I thought it'd be useful for you to get a look around just to get a sense of how things run. [BEEPS] BENNY: Just keep watch upstairs. Dakota will text me when she's at the door. [ON PHONE] JASON: All right. Let us know if you see anything down there. Hey. Wait. Wait. I think I got something. Will you find Simeone & Sons HVAC on the schedule when you're in? You know, there's something modest about a coin. You know, there's an element of trust, in that we all give it value, and we all agree on that value. And there's a real purity to that. [STAMMERS] That it's a tactile symbol, you know? I could talk your ear off. This facility actually has a very fascinating history. You know, I've got some background information on the first Mint. A lot of stuff from the bicentennial celebration. Would that be helpful for your research? That would be amazing. Thank you. Great. [SOFTLY] Let me see. - [MUTTERS] - So, you've got two kids? Yup. Nate is two, and Samantha is three and a half. Wow. That must be a lot for you and your wife. Yeah, it is. I think it's here. - Jess loves every minute of it. [EXHALES] - I bet. All right. Here you go. Actually, um, would you mind making copies for the editor? If you don't mind. - Not a problem. - Thank you. - [MACHINES WHIRRING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BEEPS] Come on. Hurry. Jason, please. Okay, how long will this take? BENNY: Depends on how complex the scan is. We need as much info as possible to make a good copy. This way. [DOOR BEEPS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [COMPUTER BEEPS] - [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] All right, I have it for you here. It's a lot, but I promise you it's all interesting stuff. Wow! [CHUCKLES] [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Hey! Hey! My classroom, now. I know you guys are skipping class, and I don't know why, but I'll find out eventually. So why don't you just tell me now, before I give you all detention. But you don't know what we were doing. - So can we go? - No. And I absolutely refuse to believe that a student who has been suspended, not once, but three times for illegal hacking activity is just skipping class for no reason. I should probably check your grades. - Make sure you're not... - Whoa! I earn my grades. I'm sure you do. Man, don't judge her. That's not what's going on. I am not "man." I am Mr. Rankin. Now, why don't you tell me how the four of you ended up together? Why wouldn't the four of us be together? You know what I mean. I don't. We were working on your design project. It was way more work than we anticipated, so we decided to help each other. Skipped a few classes to finish it, but it won't happen again. You skipped classes to do school work? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. If I can prove that you were doing something that you shouldn't be doing... and I will... all four of you are going to be expelled. If there's a school to be expelled from by the time you figure that out. That's not my fault, Hodges. Hey. You all right? Yeah, it's fine. - DAKOTA: Bye, guys. - BENNY: See you. Bye. I'm used to it. You shouldn't be. He shouldn't have said that. You're, uh... you're better than that. You're... Anyway, I'll, uh, see you later. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. I, uh, looked at the reader. The scan was clean. So I should be able to make a copy tonight. That's good. You've made IDs before? Yeah. [SCOFFS] Yeah, I've made a few. [SIGHS] - I'm not a criminal, you know. - No. No, no, that's not what I meant at all. [STAMMERS] I'm sorry. It's not okay. I know what it feels like to have people expect you to be something that you're not. - It's not fair. - [CHUCKLING] Yeah. It's no secret that I got arrested before I came to Dennington. I only made ten IDs. And I didn't even do it for the extra cash, you know, it was... It was for people in my neighborhood who were getting stopped by immigration. Sometimes at Dennington, I feel like the people that I made those IDs for. I'm always being watched by these people who are just waiting for me to mess up. I really don't think that's true. I mean, they gave you a scholarship. Yeah, because I'm smart. I want to go to college. I want to be an engineer. I think it's great that you know what you want to do. I have all these ideas but... [SIGHS] People keep telling me that I'm unrealistic. I have friends here, but they don't really know who I am. [SIGHS] That's what I'm saying, Dakota. Just because people expect you to be something doesn't mean you have to be it. You missed the visiting hours again today. Practicing a little... What are you doing here? I just came by to drop off some paperwork. I saw your mom was packing all this stuff up herself, so... Okay, well, I'm here now. Jason, please, I don't want you to think of me as the bad guy here. You're making us move out of the headmaster's house before he's even gone to trial. I'm sorry. I represent the board. It's... it's not just my decision. The president of the board, that's just a title then? Um... I wish I wasn't the one to have to tell you this, but, uh... your dad's gonna plead guilty. They know he broke the law. There's no way around it. And even with a plea deal, he's gonna do time. You don't know that. I don't have time for this. What are you doing? We got practice at Max's. [GROANS] I'm just dropping off some of your stuff. Why? I thought you were driving. The band wants a break. What do you mean, "a break"? We have to play the dance. Right. Um... the guys... feel like you're not into this anymore. You missed practice three times. What is that supposed to mean? You know how you are. You're really into something until you're not. You were probably gonna quit anyways. Look, you... you got a lot going on. I'm sorry. See you. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTS] - Hello. - Hi, Grandma. How was school today? Good. Did you find out about the scholarship? [SIGHS] Not yet. Well, when are you gonna find out? I don't know. Soon. We need to know so we can make a plan in case it doesn't come through. I'll talk to them tomorrow. Okay. ALICE: Hey! I thought I saw you down here. Why aren't you at Junibel's party? Uh... What are you still doing at school? I was just at the computer lab. It's kind of nice at night. Quiet. My dad... pleaded guilty. So... Guess he really did it. Shit. I'm so sorry. I just can't respect him anymore, you know what I mean? [INHALES] Parents do shitty things. I mean... [GULPS] My parents cheat on each other. And they think it's fine, because they come home for dinner and act like everything is totally normal. That's awful. I'm just... used to it. Yeah, but they're the ones who are supposed to have their shit together. - Yeah. - Have it figured out. So I think, if they're cheating, then why can't we cheat the system a little bit? If the adults are the ones who mess things up, then why do they get to tell us how it's gonna be? That's just the thing, I don't know that I'm the kind of guy who... I don't know, um... Who finishes sentences? Who finishes anything, apparently. You're doing your best, I think. How are you always so cool about everything? Cool? - Yeah. - [SCOFFS] Like, cool and... collected. And funny, you know. Resourceful, too. Resourceful? Yeah. Well, now you're just trying to sound smart again. Uh... What? Maybe we shouldn't complicate things. We just started... Right... [CHUCKLES] and after we're finished, you'll just pretend that I don't exist. No, that's not what I'm saying. - I just think that... - Sure. If you need a grade, or a schedule change, or to break into a government institution, I'm sure I'll be the first person you call. I have to go. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. Hey. I, uh... I thought you never come to these things. I, um... kind of figured you'd be here, so... [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Well, I'm glad you did. I like talking to you. I like talking to you, too. I was, um... I was thinking about what you said. I was thinking about it a lot, actually. I'm sorry we didn't get to talk more. That was stupid. So I... We... we can't. ETHAN: Hey, there's your girlfriend. Hey, Benny. What are you doing here? Wow. Not used to seeing you at these things. Guess I didn't realize I needed your permission to come to someone else's party. No, just, you're in North Philly, right? - How many buses did it take to get here? - Dylan. No, I'm... What? We're just trying to be nice. - Get to know him a little bit. - You did time, right? Before transferring to Dennington? Not really. No. Please stop. What? You actually wanna hang out with this guy? Listen, you don't need to be a dick. Did you just call me a dick? Seriously, what are you doing here? - Stop. - DYLAN: No. I'm here because I'm friends with Dakota. [SCOFFS] Right? Just go. Hey, this is nothing. Please? She's right. It's nothing. You sure you don't wanna go with your friends? I don't... What, do you want me to say it's okay, so you don't have to feel bad? Wait, what? No. No, I get it. You gotta look out for you. None of these people care about you. Isn't that what you said? No, I said they don't know the real me. What's the difference? You're exactly what all these people think you are. I think you should leave. Yeah. [DAKOTA SIGHING] Can we run it one more time, please? Yeah. Alice has what she needs to manipulate the digital inventory, loop the security feeds and put the design into production. Benny's fake die will be used to replace the real one that we altered last time and left there. The fake die is not sturdy enough to do an actual run, so it'll probably break. But when that happens, they'll just assume that it was faulty materials and replace the original on their own. So, we get in, we do the run, Alice covers our tracks, virtually, and we get out. If we get in. You realize, if this doesn't go perfectly, we are all going to jail? Dakota, would you just... Have you even spoken to your dad yet, Jay? Do you realize how bad this could be? - Would you just shut up? - She's right. The production floor is complicated. And we're entirely relying on the fake IDs actually getting us in as the HVAC company. The IDs will work. If anything goes wrong, it's not gonna be on me. How can you be so sure? Seriously? You're gonna question me after you barely made it past security? I got us in, didn't I? If something goes wrong... Stop saying that something's gonna go wrong. I don't know what else you want from me, here. I'm doing everything I know how to do. Okay? So, let's all relax... and figure out what's next. What else do we need? Well, I need a song list for the Winter Formal on Saturday. Yeah. About that. They, uh... The band has split up. What? - When were you planning on telling me? - It's complicated. You never go through with things! No wonder your band split up! And, by the way, what about the quarters? How are we gonna sell them? Have you thought about that? I'm still working on that part. I don't know how you expect people to trust you when you haven't even thought things through. - Jay... - Would you stop calling me Jay, Dakota? Look, we're not together anymore. You don't own me. I will get your music, I will get the coins, and I will figure out everything for everybody. Okay? Does that sound good? Does anybody else need anything while I'm at it? You know what? This... This is over. Alice, take the coin out of production. Delete it. Jason... Just do it. Good job. You know what? Yeah. This was a shit idea from the very start. [DOOR BUZZES] Thanks for coming. I'm sorry you have to see me like this. How could you do it? Not just to me, but to Mom. And the school. Everybody you know. How could you be so selfish? It's not like that. The board, they rejected my proposals for investing in new programs. They didn't wanna take a risk. - And Harold Smerconish and I... - Wait. Wait. Smerconish knew about this? He didn't agree with the rest of the board. He said that I should go through with the investments. So I transferred the money into a private bank account. And he said he wouldn't tell the rest of the board until it had paid off. That was the plan. It's not what you think. I just wanted to make a real difference. [DOOR BUZZES AND OPENS] [GAME MUSIC PLAYING ON COMPUTER] [ON HEADPHONES] GREG: I know you're blowing off steam, or whatever, but can you not murder everyone in this village before we finish the quest? [SIGHING] Sorry. [CLICKS TONGUE] Yeah, it's okay. I know it sucks. ALICE: Yeah, it sucks, but, like, what would you do? We worked really hard on our whole... design project thing, and now everyone just wants to drop out. So what? Just make a new group. I don't know, maybe include your best friend, me, next time? It's not like that, Greg. We were doing something important. Something that really mattered. Like what? Extra credit? Um... yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh... Well, if it were me, I would just go ahead and sign up for the extra credit anyway. And tell them you already signed up and it's too late to bail, especially with all the work you did. Then they'd have to help you finish it. You know, that's not the worst idea. GREG: Important decisions should not be left to the Jason Hodges of the world. Who knows, they'll probably thank you for it. [BEEPS] - Shit, I did it. - Good. See, you just had to get it over with. No. No. No. Saturday? That's too soon! [BEEPING] I never had a teacher who made me turn something in on the weekend. Wait, isn't that the night of the dance? That's cruel. Rankin is such an asshole. No way. It's locked. I'm so sorry. It was an accident. What day is it scheduled for? Saturday. - Winter Formal? Are you kidding? - Nope. Maybe we just let Alice's queue run on its own. If no one actually puts the die in the machine, it won't be able to stamp the design. Maybe they'll think the machine malfunctioned. [EXHALES] Either way, we're screwed. If we don't show up on Saturday, then the die that we altered will go into the machine in a few weeks. Hacking isn't fool proof. If they suspect something, they'll trace it back to us. [GROANS] So we have to go through with it. We'll skip the dance. No, I'm on the committee. And you still owe me for the music. Jason, the school needs this. And if I'm still in charge of alibis, I'm not letting either of us miss it. Especially with Rankin on our case. It's too suspicious. Well, only one or two of us can actually go as the HVAC company, right? - So you and me, we'll... - I was thinking Benny and I. - BENNY: You were? - ALICE: Yeah. I mean, I'm down. Okay. I'll work on getting the band back together, so Dakota can pull off this stupid dance. It is the Winter Formal. It's not stupid. It's important. Not stupid. It's important. Benny and Alice, you guys will go in as the HVAC company. Otherwise, the plan should stay the same. - All right. - All right. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Zack, I need this. No way, dude. I lost everything because of what my dad did. Don't do this to me, too. Let's play the dance. Just one last gig. It's also our first gig. One gig. But this doesn't mean the band's back together. Deal. - You going? - Mmm-hmm. - You look nice. - Thanks. I just wanted to tell you, I know I haven't been very helpful... with everything. I'm sorry. It's okay. Thanks. Have a good time. [HAMMERING] [DOORBELL RINGS] You look nice. Likewise. MRS. DRAKE: Wait! Where do you think you're going? This is Benny, my date. You guys aren't leaving. - Not yet. - Not without pictures! - MRS. DRAKE: Come on in! - [MR. DRAKE LAUGHS] MRS. DRAKE: Come on! Okay, you two, get together. [SHUTTER CLICKS] - We have to go. - MRS. DRAKE: Oh, bye, sweetie! Wow! [CHUCKLES] You guys really ran with the whole lunch thing. Weren't we supposed to? Yeah. [LAUGHS] - It looks amazing. Good job. - Thanks. Hey! Why aren't you guys rehearsing? Zack's not here. He's our singer. What? For real? All right. All right. Okay. He's not coming. - What? - MAX: Food poisoning. Well, we need a singer. - I guess we gotta call it off, then. - No! People are depending on us. We can't play without a singer. I mean, we can try to do it karaoke style. Dakota. No. Dakota. You do know all the songs. No. I am not singing. When we were still together, you helped me write practically every single one of them. There would be no band without you. [SIGHING] Okay. Let me see the set list. So you made sure we're on the HVAC schedule, right? Yes. And Dakota called and... said that the regular HVAC guys won't be there, right? Yeah, she called and sent an e-mail. And you're gonna be able to loop the security footage? Yeah, it's all ready, on my computer. It's fine. We're fine. It's going well already. Going well. Yeah. Can I help you? Yeah, we're here with Simeone & Sons HVAC. Just doing some scheduled maintenance. Who's that? That is my niece. - Your niece? - Yup. Just brought her along for the night. Doing a little internship, apprenticeship-type thing. If it's a problem, you know, she can just wait in the van. [MACHINE BEEPS] Boiler room. You know the way. How long is this gonna take? Okay, got it. Let's go. DAKOTA: No, no, no. No, you guys don't need to come. I called last night and said that we don't need you. I don't understand... Hello? Shit. What? The HVAC guy is still coming. I couldn't stop him. Then we gotta go. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Where are you guys going? We got a band emergency. So we have to get back to the rental place. - We'll be back in, like, an hour. - But you go on in an hour. Yeah, exactly. - See you then. - Bye. [MACHINE BEEPING] [MACHINE BEEPS] I got it. I got it. [THUMPING] [BEEPING] [COINS CLATTERING] Right there. [MACHINE BEEPS] [COINS JINGLING] [MACHINE WHIRRING] [CELL PHONE BUZZES] Okay, Jason and Dakota are coming... - and so is the actual HVAC guy. - [DOOR OPENS] - Shit. - God. [DOOR BEEPS] [DOOR CLOSES] [MACHINE BEEPING] - Oh, my God. - What is that? [MACHINES POWERING UP] I think the machines are starting up again. DAKOTA: No. No, no, no, no. - JASON: Shit. - What do we do? [JINGLING] - What's going on? - The sequence is queued up ten times. What does that mean? We're making 20,000 quarters. [SIGHS] [BEEPS] [CELL PHONE BUZZES] - Alice. - What? - We need the guitar case. - [SIGHS] We already let your guys in. They showed up about 20 minutes ago. That's so weird. Somebody called me, told me not to come in. I just want to check out our duct work from last week. That okay? One second. I need you to check the boiler room. We might have a situation. Ten-four. We've got a problem. They're not here. [BEEPING] Okay. They're right here. [DOOR OPENS] [WHISPERS] In there! [SIGHING] Great. - Hi. You wanted back up? - Not you two. - What's wrong with us two? - [SIGHS] Nothing. Follow me. Hurry up! [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [WHISPERING] JASON: What are you doing? [WHISPERING] We're only gonna have five minutes until the feeds are live, after I reset the security cameras. Alice, I don't... We gotta go. Hey, I'm sorry about what I said the other day. It's just... You know, I like you. [EXHALES] Yeah... [GASPS] Let's go. - Watch the monitors. - All right. All right. - What about us? - Just stay out of the way. The ducts are good. [COINS JINGLING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] - BENNY: Alice! - [COINS JANGLING] - Try it when I tell you. - Okay. Okay. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] BENNY: Try it! [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [ENGINE STARTS] I don't see 'em. They have to be here. Parking garage is empty! Damn it. [SIGHS] - Okay. - Okay. [BOTH EXHALE] Someone's watching us. JASON: Rankin. He followed us. Okay. Come on. [ENGINE STARTS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Have you guys seen Hodges and Dakota? Guys, have you seen Hodges and Dakota? Okay, it's our job to chaperone.

We just turned it in, actually. Then why are you just standing here looking so miserable? I'm sorry, Greg. For what? You were right. I thought it was more than a project, but they were just using me. Like you said. [SINGING CONTINUES] [SIGHING] I don't know about that. It seems like he does actually like you for some reason. I mean, like, he's staring at you. Like, right now. It's kind of weird. [SIGHS] I'll see you around. Dakota, that was incredible. Thanks. Where are you going? - Can you play the next one without me? - You're the lead guitarist, we can't. - Great job. - Thanks. You, too. Wait like five minutes. Hey, look, you can't be back here. I thought you were my date. I haven't seen you all night. Now you're back here with Hodges? I was on stage singing with the band. - Yeah, when did that happen? - Does it matter? - Let's go back to the limo and hang out. - No! I think we should break up. What? This isn't working out anymore. Are you kidding me? JASON: What are you doing out here? I don't know. Aren't you in the middle of your big performance or whatever? I asked for a break. I didn't mean to mess things up with you. Just wanted to say that. And, uh... I'm sorry. Found your chicken burger. Let's go, now. MR. RANKIN: Open it. What's in the toolbox, Jason? Open it, Jason. Okay. Now we call the cops. During a very challenging semester. We would particularly like to thank the President of the Board, Harold Smerconish. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, Ms. Coyle. And thank you, Dennington Prep students. I know it's not fair that you've had to sacrifice your extracurricular activities and programs. But I thought you should know that your headmaster... your former headmaster... will be facing consequences for his actions. [APPLAUSE] Now, uh... - Wait. - No. Now is not the time, Hodges. Before you call the police, don't you think the President of the Board would want to know first? MR. SMERCONISH: Thank you for letting me have these words with you and enjoy the rest of your Winter Formal. Good night. [APPLAUSE] Jason, what are you doing? Sir. Sir, hi. Hi, I'm... I'm Todd. - Todd Rankin. - Ah. I teach art and design. We've met before. Um... can I just have a moment of your time? Sure. Jason. Dakota. Follow me. This is a very serious situation. MR. RANKIN: Mmm-hmm. They've been planning it for a while. They've been skipping class and tonight I found out that they were using school resources. [STAMMERS] I've heard enough. Let me see the quarter. So, here's what's going to happen. You're going to give everything you have to me, I'll handle turning it all over to the authorities. I'd advise the four of you to get lawyers, as the police will undoubtedly start asking questions quite soon. Needless to say, you're all expelled. We'll take care of this as quietly as possible, and that'll be the end of it. [COIN CLATTERS] You don't understand. We did all of this for the school. We love Dennington! You have to believe us. I do believe you, Dakota. But that doesn't alter the fact that your actions were highly illegal, which comes at a price. The last thing we want for Dennington Prep is to be in the headlines again for fraudulent activity. You know all about handling fraudulent activity, don't you? Excuse me? I know that you gave my dad the go-ahead on investing the school's endowment. We're talking about an entirely different matter here. This has nothing to do with that. Yeah. You're always gonna save yourself. Okay, Jason, this is highly inappropriate behavior right now. I'm just trying to help Mr. Smerconish here. I mean, if he really wants to save himself, he won't turn these quarters over to the police. Of course he will. What are you saying, Jason? I'm saying that the error coin we created has never existed before. By introducing it to auction houses at strategic times, you could have one of the most valuable coins on the market, and you would own the entire collection. And the Mint? They don't know. JASON: They'll never know how it happened. They will be able to verify the authenticity of that coin. Okay, this is insane. How did you do this? Um... [STAMMERS] He can't really get too into that. What do you want for them? Sir, you're not actually considering this as a possibility. Immunity. For all of us. And a guarantee you'll fill the school's endowment with an anonymous donation. What is happening? Let me see all of them. Is this it? Yeah. Are you sure? Because we could certainly do a lot more business if you hand all of them over to me, son. I am very sure. Two thousand quarters. Do we have a deal? Fine. Deal. Eh... Sir, I'm sorry... Excuse me, but I don't think it's a really good idea to be enabling these kids in starting some... Yeah, uh, thanks for bringing them here, Mr., um... Rankin! Todd Rankin! We have met a thousand times! I teach art and design! I think you should stop shouting at these kids, Mr. Rankin. They've done us all a big favor. Saved your job. How'd you know that would work? I didn't. But I watched a lot of heist movies. What are we gonna do with the rest of the coins? You're smart kids. Get rid of them. I'll see you guys Monday. I got an idea. It's not half bad. I kind of like it. [CHUCKLES] It's literally made of money. [COINS JINGLING] Last four. You got anywhere you need to be? Not right now. - Bye, guys. - ALICE: Bye. BENNY: See you. So... is your boyfriend coming to pick you up? No, that's over. Hey... I'm really sorry I let him talk to you like that. Yeah. That... that was the worst. [SCOFFS] I know. You want to start over? It's funny, I thought this whole thing... was about following through with something good. Different. At the end of the day, I think... people like Smerconish, they're the ones who always win. I think... we did what we had to do. I'm not coming back to school in the fall. What? Why? We just saved the school. I just don't want to be my dad's legacy here. I want to leave all of that behind. With the statue and everything that we did here tonight. Okay. I'm not skipping town or anything. Getting to know you... has been... one of the best things to happen to me in a... a really long time. I'm not just gonna give all that up because I'm moving schools. You're so smart. Good at, um... knowing who you are. I'm... I'm still trying to learn how to do that. So... I don't know if this is making any sense. [CHUCKLES] What? You know, if you're trying to sound smart, I think it might actually be working this time. Yeah? Yeah.
