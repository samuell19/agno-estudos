[traffic noise, distant horns blaring] [car horn beeps] [car horn beeps] [driver speaks Farsi] Are you all right? Is there anything I should know? Thanks be to God. Don't worry about a thing. I've got to return the car, then I'll take you home. You must be tired. Where is Mr Sadegh? I don't know. Is he in today? Yes. He's around. Wait there. [men chattering in Farsi] What's this? Lose it. Come on. You're not going for a picnic. It's all I've got. If you have a problem, get off. No suitcases allowed. Get rid of it. Take care with the child. Get in and sit at the back, sweetie. Squeeze in, everyone! Not him, not him! Off, off, off. - Get down. Give him his bag. - Why? What's the problem? You'll only be trouble. - Why? - I said move along. Let me get on, please. You told me to come today. Move to the back. Close it up. We're done. It'll be okay soon. You can't go with that leg. Don't argue with me! It'll be fine. - Take your bag. - Why? Talk to Mr Sadegh. If he agrees, then you can go. Okay? Stay here and keep your mouth shut. What do you want? Who are you looking at? Are you deaf? Speak to me. Who are you looking for? I said who are you looking for? What is it? None of your business. What the hell are you doing here? Mr Sadegh told me I could come back to work. Don't be stupid. Get out of here. - Mr Sadegh told me... - Shut up and get lost! Out! - I said Mr Sadegh... - Out! - Listen... - I said get out! I said get out! [Sadegh] Ahmad! Leave him alone. Excuse me, sir, but he says you told him to come back. He's right. Why should Basir work here again, sir? He's promised not to make any more trouble. Besides, he can bring us more immigrants. If he makes any more trouble, I'll teach him a lesson he won't forget. Understood, sir. I promise. - Is this your sister-in-law? - Yes, sir. - Have you spoken to your husband? - She just arrived, sir. It took only two months for your husband to reach his destination. I'll do the same for you. The journey's no picnic. Can you make it across the border on foot? - Sure she can... - Are you her mouthpiece? Let me know when the money's ready. Back to work. May I take my sister-in-law home, sir? Ahmad will take her. - What do you mean, sir? - Get back to work! Don't ask me again. And another thing... no more of this cat and dog business. You're meant to work together. What did you want to tell me? What should we do with him, sir? What do you want me to do with a cripple? Hide him in my pocket? Tell him to forget it. - Come to the office. - Yes, sir. Take this mobile. Do you know how it works? "SHAFA CLINIC" 500 METRES - [car engine stalls] - [Ahmad] Ah! - Shit, come on! - [car engine starts] It's there... The brick house at the end. Hurry up. [car engine splutters] [car engine starts] Hurry up! [Leila] You know I couldn't stay. Don't worry. Just make sure Father doesn't find out. Forgive me, Mother. Goodbye. [knocking on door] Hello. Did I come at a bad time? Would you like me to come back later? It's fine. My mother sent me to see if you need anything. No, thank you. Your scarf is very beautiful. Did you buy it in Afghanistan? Yes. You shouldn't be on your own. Come to ours. No, thanks. Come on. Don't be shy. It's harder by yourself. Couldn't your husband wait to make the journey with you? He went ahead to arrange things. Then Basir would send me. Does he love you? Yes. It's nice when someone loves you. Yes, it is. What about you? What about me? I have my pick. Take this one, for example. He's a great lover. Sometimes he makes me crazy. He says, "I love you. I'll die for you." Then there's this one. He's very hot-tempered and shouts a lot. Take a look at his moustache. A man needs a bit of charisma. This poor one stepped on a landmine. This one's the best of all. He's very rich. If I marry him, all the girls will be jealous. What a dream. I don't even have a hot-tempered man. Tell me about yours. What's he like? [Basir] It's not that easy. They want all the money up front. You were supposed to send me some money. Don't worry, we'll find a way. I'll send her over in a month. Yes, she's here. Hello? Hello. I'm fine. Yes, a little. Was the journey hard? Hello? I said was the journey hard? Hello? Hello? What happened? I don't know. He must have run out of credit. Let me call him. [thudding] What happened to you? Do you feel better? What happened? I don't know. I just felt a bit dizzy. If you don't take care of yourself, how will you manage the journey? Has she eaten anything? She's just tired. She hasn't rested since she arrived. She went out again at noon. She should rest. We're leaving now. Rest, my dear. Bye then. If you need anything, Mr Basir, just ask. Sure, thanks. Bye. [door closes] [Basir banging about] Where did you go? I just went out for a moment. Why did you go out? I felt awkward. What do you mean, awkward? Don't you get the fact that you're illegal here? Why did you call Afghanistan? Do you want everyone to know you're in Iran? Don't you understand you've ruined your family's honour? You got married without their permission. Then you left the country. If your brother finds you, he'll kill you. None of that is my business. Just don't make any trouble for me. Understand? What street? Number 66? Thanks, I'll be there. That's a bit late. Is there no way I can come earlier? Okay, I'll be there. [door opens and shuts clumsily] Where have you been? Answer me. Where have you been? How could my brother be so stupid to choose a girl like you as his wife? Why are you shouting? Aren't you ashamed to be shouting at a lonely woman? Mr Sadegh? I'm sorry to disturb you. Is there any chance you could send my sister-in-law in the next shipment? I'll pay some now and you can take the rest from my salary. In three days? Thank you. That's very kind. Mr Sadegh? [Tabasom] How did you get the doctor's address? I asked at a clinic. - Does Basir know? - No. Don't you realise they'll fire him if they find out you're pregnant? They won't find out. What if they do? If Basir knows, he'll stop me. He has every right to know. If they fire him again, he can't pay his rent again. This time, my mother will ask him to leave. I must tell him the truth. I must make this journey. - How are you? - What a surprise. - My friend needs your help. - Come in. There's a herb that aborts the foetus naturally. We'll take it. I don't have any. I'll bring some tomorrow. - I don't want to trouble you. - Your house is on my way. [knocking on door] Come in. [Basir] Hello. Hello, Mr Basir. Come in, please. Thank you. Pack your suitcase and don't load it with unnecessary stuff. We leave tomorrow. Bring something to veil yourself. Isn't she leaving the day after tomorrow? She'll cross the border the day after tomorrow. It takes a full day to get close enough to cross. What's the hurry? I've arranged everything. She has to go. I'll be back to pick you up in the morning. Be ready. Goodbye. Goodbye. [door closes] Wait a minute, Leila. Hurry up. The car's here. Give her this bundle. I've made some food. When you feel hungry, eat a bit. It's heavy. I'll take it for you. Take this prayer. Keep it close. It will protect you. Once more. God be with you. What are you waiting for? Get in the car. Hurry up. Get in the car. [Ahmad] Faster, faster, faster! Turn left. Move. Head for the river. Move it! Hold on to each other. Head for the river. Hurry up! Move it! Hurry up! Why are you so slow? Get up. Why have you sat down? Come on. The border's only a bit further. Come on. We can't wait for you. Hurry up. You've left us behind! Help! - Help! - [gunshot] [dog barking] [dog barking] [dog barking] [dog barking] Run! Border guards. Run! [she whimpers] [thunder rumbles] [man coughs] [man coughs] [man groans quietly] [man groans quietly] [man coughs] [woman in Farsi] Parsa, what are you doing? [thunder rumbles] [in English] You know you shouldn't carry these on you? If the police will catch you, you'll be in trouble. [she coughs] [in English] Passport? Me, me responsible? I am responsible for everything from now on. Understand? - Er... - When you go to England, you can try and get a new passport. Till then, these stay with me. - But I... I hide... - I told you, woman, already! Sit! [man coughs] What about him? He also has a passport? Er... I don't know, sir. Er, sorry. - Are you sure it's the flu? - Er, yes, I told you. Erm... On the way, on the way, erm... cold. Er, he okay. He'd better be okay. Okay, give me the rent for this week. [young man] Euros gone. I, er, have dollars. - Dollars are fine. - Okay. Dollars are fine. Money's money. It's one hundred. I'll give you the change later. - Sure, huh? - Sure. How about him? He has money? I don't know, sir. Er... He asleep. Where did you find that, huh? [Parsa coughs] [young man] When, er, we leave here? - [Parsa coughs] - Very soon. [Parsa coughs] See you all tomorrow. [door opens] [door shuts] [in Farsi] Parsa, take this money, go to the toilet and put it in your pocket. Okay, Mum. Parsa, you do know which pocket I mean? Parsa, careful not to drop it. [panting] [groaning] - [rips dressing off] - [he groans] [sick man groaning quietly] Are you all right? Yeah, Mum. Breakfast will be ready in a minute, okay? Okay, Mum. [he spits and gags] [in English] I no eat from yesterday. What, rent? Rent include food, yeah? - [in Farsi] Give it to him. - Pay rent for this?! - Careful, it's hot. - Okay, Mum. [in English] What that? [in English] Prayer. My father's. Wh... Where... he? Dead. Oh... I'm sorry for... dog bite you. Er, if you don't stop dog... er, dog bite me. [in Farsi] Mum, could you take this? - [door opens] - Thanks. Eat this. [door shuts] [in English] Make me a tea? [Greek man] You understand Greek? [young man] No. Er, when do we, er... go from Greece, you think? - I don't know. - Er... Because, er, they told us not stay long here, you know. Go, er, quick. Er, when, I mean, when I go? You might be lucky. Maybe next week. Er, good, good. Er, when? I don't know. - Er, you know someone I call... - I said I don't know. - Are you stupid? - [sick man coughs] Now let me have my tea. - [sick man coughs] - Thank you, sir. [sick man coughs] What's wrong with him? - [coughs] - What's wrong with you? - [coughs] - Hey, come on, get up. - [coughs] - Oh, okay. What's wrong with you? Every time I come in you're asleep. Give me the rent. [in Farsi] Parsa, come here. Hey, what's wrong with... - Agh! Hey, hey! - What is this? Agh! Agh! - Eh? - Agh! - [Greek man] What is this? - Parsa, come here. [Greek man] Get your hand off me! Eh? Like, what is this? This is no good. [sick man groans] No, sir! - [young man shouting] - Lying bastard! You lying bastard! - Lying bastard! - No! Agh! No! - You lying bastard! - No, stop! Please, no! Where are you going, huh? - You want some trouble too? - [all shouting] Eh? Listen, no! There's no problem already! Do you think I'm stupid? All of you, help him! All of you... Shut up! All of you, help him! - Shut up! - No! You think I'm... Shut up! All of you! You think I'm stupid? No, sir, please! I make nothing! - [kicks thuds] - Aagh! [in Greek] Hi, boss, we have a problem. I not make anything! I don't know him! - I don't want trouble! Huh? - [door slams] [Parsa panting shakily] - Are you all right? - I'm fine, Mum. [she sobs] Mum. [dog barks in the distance] [woman in Farsi] Careful, don't tie it too tight. [sick man groans and pants] [tablets rattle] Where did you get that? It was in the kitchen, in the kitchen cupboard. That won't help. They're sleeping tablets. [sick man sighs] Parsa. [he groans quietly] Parsa. [Parsa giggles] [Parsa giggles] [Parsa laughs] [both in Arabic] Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what lies before them His creation, and after them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. - [whispers in Farsi] Lonely. - [young man mutters in English] How... do... I... get... to... - Lon... - [door lock rattles] [door opens] [footsteps] [door shuts] [in Farsi] Wait here. - [woman in English] Mister? - [Greek man] What? I... I ask you a question. When we go from Greece? I don't know. It's, erm, dangerous with child. My brother, in London... I don't care about your brother. I told you, woman! - But I... I... - What? - Can you help? - Help?! Yes, because the child with me, it's not very good to stay here. Woman, I don't know what else to say to you. - I don't know. - But, er... What, what, what? What do you want me to say to you? - If you can just help... - Help?! - [mug shatters] - Look what you've done! Okay? Help, help, help! I'm doing this, okay? All you want is help! Come here. Come here! How can I help you? There's a dead man there! Help, help, help! All you want is help. Huh? How do I help you, huh? Look at this, huh? Look at it! How do I help you, huh? This is trouble. You want help? How am I supposed to help? Look at this! Look! You lied to me. All of you. All of you lied. He won't travel! He won't... He won't go anywhere! Look at his foot! You want help? Tell me. Tell me, how do I help you, huh? [door opens] [door shuts] Hmmm! Hmm! - [rapid knocking] - [Greek man] Come on! What you doing inside, huh? [knocking] Come on! [thunder rumbles] Parsa? Son? Come. Erm, er... Water is... cold. Erm, you can make... hot? You want me to make the water hot for you? You want me to wash your back too? [door shuts] Don't be scared, you know. I'm really sorry about earlier. You know I don't want to hurt your mother. He's ill. You know he'll be trouble for you and for your mum. I like you, Parsa. I make everything ready for all of you. Altogether, to leave tomorrow to UK. You happy now? Look, I have this for you. Take it. It's not real gold. But if you work hard, you can buy a real one one day, you know. [sick man coughs] Parsa. Son, this is for him. - It's good for him. - [sick man coughs] [lock rattles] [door opens quietly] [footsteps] [Greek man] Shh! [footsteps] [man speaks Greek] [bedclothes rustle] [he sobs] [electric window whirs] [wind gusts] [woman whispers indistinctly] [man on TV] ...chamber pressure by placing the foam doughnut over the eye - beyond the ventural side. - [man snores] The inter-mandibular space may be pressed to move the tongue upwards... - [man snores] - Medium plane of anaesthesia. ...can pull the tongue rosterly to locate the glottis. Medium plane... When the glottis opens during inspiration... ...of anaesthesia. - [TV commentary continues] - [man snores] [she whistles a long note] ...to prevent the tongue from slipping off the endotracheal tube. [she whistles a long note] [he snores loudly] - Sami. - [he groans] Sami, you're snoring. Sh... Oh, sorry. ...and adhere to the lower beak's carotene surfaces... [TV commentary continues indistinctly] - [TV volume increases] - ...or keep the bird under anaesthesia. However, it is not recommended that the circuit be attached while taping. Hi. - [Laura] Hi, sweetie. - [Sami] Hi. - Lubricate the eyes... - [Laura] Do these need to be here? I'm working on that for Alexia. I need to study. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Can you test me? [laughs] - Just the birds. - Oh... And the reptiles. Ovary with follicles. [Alexia] It's crashed again. Well, what are you trying to do? I just opened it and it froze. Did you save anything? No, how can I? - One minute. - Okay. [he mutters] How's your dad? Same. - [TV commentary continues] - [Sami] How was the party? - A bit awkward. - Why? - Cos his girlfriend was there. - Lubricate the eyes and avoid interior chamber pressure by placing the foam doughnut over the eye... Name the five regions... of the feline spinal column. - Er, cervical. - A-huh. Er, sacral. Er, chordal and... What does it start with? Th... Thara... Thor... - Thora... Thora... Thora... - Thora... - Thora... Thora... - Thoracic, thoracic. - Thoracic. - Enough. Please. My mum's been nagging me again. - About us? - Mm-hm. She knows how I feel but... she wouldn't mind planning another wedding. Would that be so bad? Marriage spoils everything. [Laughs] But she does really want to meet you. She's starting to suspect that I'm making you up. This great man that's funding my studies. Mmm. They can visit. You know they can't. Let's go to Poland for Easter. Just... just for one week, please. Let's talk tomorrow. I'm tired. Sleep. [she sighs] If you give me a week, I will do it after the exams. Why can't I just go to the salon Sally uses? It just doesn't make sense when you have a private hairdresser at home. [car horn beeps] I'm not paying for it. I'll just go on the weekend, when I'm staying with Dad. I don't think it's a good idea to stay there all weekend. Here. I'll lend you this, 20. - Not quite enough. - Oh. Your lunch. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Don't be late. - Thanks. [woman on radio] Chilly though, with a high of only four Celsius, which is round about 39 Fahrenheit. So wrap up! It's going to feel pretty miserable out there if you get caught in those, fellas. They'll be a ground frost, so watch out for black ice on untreated roads. [indistinct conversation] So it wouldn't cost much more. - Okay, then, I'll leave it to you. - Yes? Okay. [door closes] - Did they say they would come back? - No. - Did they give you anything? - No. [Laura sighs] - I'm so sorry. - [Laura] Sorry? Hey! I was supposed to fix her computer and, erm, I didn't have enough time, but I'll do it for you tomorrow, okay? So don't worry. Let's just get your mum through her exams. Okay? Guys, you don't have to be quiet because of me. - Some salad? - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - Mm. - That's okay, just a bit. [Sami coughs] Sorry. [phone rings] Hello. Kareem. Mm-hm. [he speaks Arabic] Okay. [he speaks Arabic] Sorry. Who was that? Kareem. The lawyer? Mm-hm. He's doing some stuff for me, at work. Nothing important. I know... I've been so preoccupied. Things will go back to normal after the exam, I promise. [she goes upstairs] [bedroom door slams] Is she okay? [mutters indistinctly] [thunder rumbles] [moans quietly] - Hi, you. - Hiya. I didn't hear you get up. No, I didn't want to wake you up. Hmm. It's your big day. I'll make you some lunch to take. [thunder rumbles] Tuna, brain food. Sami... [he sighs] [laughs] Come on. Name me the five parts... of the... the... the... the cat's, erm... you know, you know. Mm. Cervical, lumber, chordal, er... [mutters] Sacral. Sami. Can I have some water, please? Sami, what's wrong? Just tired. Tell me. [indistinct voices outside] [knocking on front door] [rapid knocking on front door, dog barks] [dog barks, front door opens] [woman] We have reason to believe you've overstayed your visa and are living here illegally. - But my lawyer is dealing with the application. - Can we come inside, please? - All of you? - Just myself and my colleague. - Can't I just come to the offices, please? - It will be better if we come inside, Mr Abrika. Mr Abrika, I'm going to have to ask you for your fingerprint. - We need to check you're on our system. - Okay. Put your finger here. - When did your visa expire? - I can't remember exactly. My lawyer... Our records confirm that your visa expired more than two years ago. - Can you confirm that, Mr Abrika? - I can't remember exactly. - I've been here for over 15 years... - Your visa has expired. Therefore I am arresting you as someone who is liable to be detained. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something that you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand? Yes. May I get my bag, please? Yes. I'll have to come with you. It's already packed. It's just here. I'll call you when I can. Go to your exam. His phone is off. Where did you get this from? Alexia? They came here yesterday too. Why didn't you tell me? We just thought we'd get you through your exams. Mum, go to your exam. [speaks angrily in Polish] I'll drop you off at school. Go to your exam. [speaks angrily in Polish] [kitten meows] [kitten meows] [kitten meows] [Sami talks indistinctly on mobile] I thought we could say... we can say each other everything? Yes. Yes, can you talk now for a little bit longer? Okay, did you speak to Kareem? Shall I... Okay. Okay, okay. And, er... And... And do you need anything? It doesn't matter, bloody exam! Don't ask me about this. Yeah. When can... When can I talk to you next? Can you give me your telephone number? Okay. Okay, okay. I will... Bye. Bye. Bye. Love you too. [indistinct chatter, baby chuckles] [baby chuckles] How's Alexia? Fine. How did your exam go? Kareem, er, says it's best for me to leave the country of my own accord. I'll reapply for my visa when I'm back in Algeria. Don't worry, I didn't make it. Alexia did. Sorry, love, you can't bring that in here. - It's just lasagne. - Not allowed. Shh, shh, it's okay. It's ridiculous! What if we got married? Thanks. But, er... Kareem and I spoke about this already, it's too late for that now. We could always visit. At Easter. Alexia has holidays. [buzzer sounds] [male guard] Everyone needs to start getting ready to leave, please. It's okay. You better go. Time's up. Everyone make your way to the exits, please. [Laura's footsteps fade away] Do you think I've done enough time to get more hours? Well, you've only just started. I've been here a month, part time. I really need full time. You should talk to the agency about that. - Don't I need written feedback for that? - I'll ask. Can I remind you, I must be out of this building by four. [Mrs Broda] Just trying to connect to Dover, sir. The next one's there. Ah, here we go. Dover, good morning. Or rather, afternoon. We're ready. [guard in Dover] All right, I'll just be outside. Call me when you're done. [judge] Er, who are we on now? [Mrs Broda] Here's the file, sir. This, er... It's in Arabic so we have the interpreter there. [hesitantly] Mrs Nabila Al Shareef. I see that you have requested an interpreter. [in Arabic] My name is Ramzi Jameel. I am your interpreter. Do you understand me? Speak up. Do you understand me? Yes. Yes, she understands me. Do you have representation? Do you have representation? Do you have assistance? Don't worry, I'm here to help you. What did you just say to her? I said that I'm... we're here to help her. It's very important that you only interpret what is said, neither more nor less. Do you understand? Yes, sir, of course. [judge] Very well then. Let's be clear, bail will only be granted if I'm satisfied that the detainee will comply with any bail conditions I set, and in particular, will present herself to the immigration authorities when the date for removal arrives. If you listen to the rules of the court, they could let you out on bail, but it's very important that you show up on the day of the deportation. Your prospects rest heavily on the strength of your surety. They could let you out, but everything depends on your sponsor. Is the surety here? Yes, sir, it's the brother. He's outside. Good. Please call him in then. Oh, sorry, sir. It's not working again. Shall I call the technician? [he sighs] [in English] Excuse me, brother. Erm... Can you please help, I don't understand. I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to speak to anyone outside the courtroom. - Please. - I'm sorry. [Mrs Broda] Her surety should be just coming now, sir. Sorry for the lost time. I'm sure we can make it up. [judge] Thank you, Mrs Broda. How is your English, Mr Al Shareef? Only little. Mr Patel? Mr Al Shareef, please explain why you've taken on surety for Mrs Al Shareef. [in Arabic] Why did you agree to be her sponsor? Because she is my sister and takes care of my son... They are brother and sister and they have a child. - They?! - [Mr Al Shareef] No, no, no. - Me only. - Sorry, sir. It's his child and she helps look after him. So, why has he been granted the right to remain in the UK and not his sister? If you can see on page 21 in the Home Office bundle, it suggests they're not actually brother and sister. Nabila, everything is going to be fine, okay? Their passports bear different surnames and their countries of birth are different. Ismail's outside. I don't want him to see me like this. If you wish to speak to the detainee, please visit her in the detention centre. They don't believe you are siblings. Your passport names are different. What? Your passport names are different. We already admitted the passports are fake. They still insist I'm a liar? Mr Al Shareef, do you trust Mrs Al Shareef not to abscond? As a result, you will lose the money put down as a surety. Do you know that you can lose the bail money? Are you asking me or telling me? Do you trust her not to run away? [judge] Please state your answer. - You have to speak. - Yes. Yes, I trust her. Can we see Mr Al Shareef's documentation, please? Passports, papers? Do you have any? Yes, here. [Mr Patel] You're missing proof of address, bank statement, tenancy agreement and... we need originals. - This is really insufficient. - Khal, I need the toilet. [in Arabic] Uncle? You said father. - Please, brother, keep it between us. - What? She's his mum, but whatever happens she wants him to stay here. I don't understand. Don't say anything. They'll deport him with her. - Why don't you tell them? They could help. - Keep it between us, please. What... what is he saying? The child needs to use the bathroom and he needs to take him. [judge] Fine! It's almost four anyway. Erm... We will continue tomorrow and that will give you the opportunity to provide the correct paperwork. Thank you. Hang on. Bring your bank statements and proof of address, good? [Ismail in English] Wow, it's gone dark! [in Arabic] Yeah, it's dark. Thanks for not saying anything. [Ismail giggles] Have some. No, thanks. - Have some. - No, thanks. [in English] I'm not allowed to speak to you outside the courtroom. When you come here? When? [Ismail giggles] [slow music plays in the background] [Claire] What are you cooking? Some quiche thing. Help yourself. I'm going to Mum and Dad's, remember? Oh, yeah. Forgot that. Careful with that oven. It's dangerous. We should really ask the landlord for a new one. But, er, if we ask for stuff, he's probably going to put the rent up. Maybe we should just buy one ourselves. You're doing well now. What do you think? What do you think? - Sorry? - The oven. It's not going to kill us just yet. It's fine for now. No, it's not. - When are you coming back? - Monday. Bye. See ya. [door opens and shuts] [timer buzzing] Oh, thanks. You're due in court in half an hour. - What's wrong with the lift? - Temperamental. - Oh! - I'm so sorry. Why do some people not get representation? - It's up to them to find a lawyer. - What about if they want to get... You must have learnt by now not to get involved. You have to stay neutral. The best thing you can do for those people is to just do your job. [indistinct chatter] I was sitting here for too long. You have to sort me out! - [man] It's a very long time. - [conversation continues indistinctly] The addresses don't match, so... This is your previous address, I assume? [man] These things do take time. [woman] Three weeks is a very long time. Is there anything we can do to speed you up? [man] Well, once the paper goes through then you'll be speeded up. Once that goes through, then you will be speeded up. [indistinct chatter, phone rings] [Mrs Broda] Ah, the files are here, somewhere. We can start in a moment, the interpreter's on his way. If you remember, this is the case we postponed yesterday. [judge] Yes. Thank you, that's fine. Do you have the bundle for this one? [Mrs Broda] Er, yes, sir. Er... Good. Now, the missing documents? [in Arabic] Did you get the papers? What about the tenancy agreement? [in Arabic] Did you bring the agreement? What agreement? I brought everything you wanted. The only thing I see is the bank statement with the address. [in English] No, no, everything, everything. [in Arabic] You didn't bring your tenancy agreement. - [Mr Patel] We need the tenancy agreement... - Look. - ...to assure the resident's address. - Look, look, Sydney Road. - The papers are not right. - No, everything is there. We need the tenancy agreement to assure the resident's address. The papers are not right. If you do not have the correct paperwork, then this tribunal will not be able to gauge properly whether the detainee will abscond or not. - I don't understand. What is he saying? - Wait, hang on, hang on. What do you mean, "hang on"? Explain, I don't get you. [Ismail makes playful sounds] I forgot to tell you to bring the agreement. I'm sorry. [judge] We have to move on from this now. We've really spent too much time on this one. Sir... I think I've made a mistake. I didn't tell Mr Al Shareef to bring the tenancy agreement. [judge] It's irrelevant, really. Even with the tenancy agreement, I consider that her immigration history is a poor one. - I cannot be satisfied... - But what about the child? She's his... She's like a mother to him. Do you have some sort of connection with this family? Look, sir, it's my fault. Not his. This is not the way to conduct yourself if you wish to remain in this job. [judge] I have given careful consideration... Explain. What's he saying? - There's nothing that can be done. - Nothing that can be done? Listen, say a word. What a joke! [judge] I have no reason to believe that if the detainee were released, - she would not abscond. - [Mr Al Shareef] Please, er... No, no, listen... [judge] I cannot be satisfied that she will... [in Arabic] It's all about throwing money on people! What is this person saying? - [judge] Her surety has... - [Mr Al Shareef] No, no, please. Listen, I don't understand. Listen. - [judge] There is insufficient surety. - [Mr Al Shareef] No, no. I cannot grant bail. No judge would. [Nabila sobs] [judge] Right. We have the next one due in. Clear now, please. [Mrs Broda] Yes, sir. The next one's coming in in person. We're finished! Thank you, Dover! Please take care of your child. [Nabila sobs] Leave him. [Mrs Broda] If you have any questions, go downstairs to the front desk. They'll answer them for you there. Okay? Thank you very much. [door closes] [Mrs Broda] Next up we have Mr Zureikat. He's Arabic-speaking so the interpreter can stay here. [judge] Very well. Let's look at the bundle, shall we? [Mrs Broda] Mm-hm. It's the second appeal. Shall I go and fetch them?
