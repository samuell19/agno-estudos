I want you to go to the hospital. The doctor will take a pap smear there and we'll use it for identification once we catch him. You ain't catching him. Here's my card. Call me if you change your mind, and you want to add anything. Detective Maria Quinn. If you don't smoke, don't start now. I'm Vincent Cusak your new partner. Maria Quinn. What happened to Rooney? I was supposed to meet Rooney here. Rooney is out on sick leave. Personal business he's got to take care of. Captain thinks it's a good idea for you and me to be partners. Captain said. - First aggravated rape? - Yeah. You got through it without cracking. And I see you arranged to be late, so I would have to interview her alone. Some kind of test, Cusak? How did you get assigned to me, Quinn? I'm a senior detective in Mid Manhattan, arguably the best dick in New York. Now that my partner is retired, how did someone like you get assigned to me? - Providence? - That kind of providence comes from being well connected. I'm not sleeping with the commissioner. Too bad for the commissioner. Quinn, lace Irish, right? Long Island, right? Forest Hills. Probably went to one of them fancy Ivy League schools. Not Dartmouth, Marymount or anything like that. Hey, get off my car! Get out of here. Follow your man. Look at this. I'd say that takes some juice, Maria. Do you have anything more for me? Because I have a family dinner. I'm in favor of families. I have to ask you a good question. - Yes, Peter. You won't believe this, they're all asleep. Good. Good, good, good, good, good. Dennis, what you teach? - Drink, drink... - Oh, yes. What you professor of? Well... Here, here, more food, yes. Where you meet my beautiful sister? I audited his class. Audit. Like a bookkeeper? She audited me like a bookkeeper. I think I'm drunk. Good, good, good, good. This is the game Peter plays for dad. Actually, Peter has an MBA from Columbia. Hey, hey, stop please. I married an immigrant. Maria married a cop. Papa, what do you think, papa? Oh. First day on the job. I got to call my partner. Excuse me. Maria... "My karma ran over my dogma?" What the hell does that mean? Sorry, I quit, but I hate quitters. How's the family? Should be happy, Dow Jones is up. Yes, we had money. Yes, we went to private schools and had live-in help. And yes, it all went. And now I live on my salary, the same as you do. So request a different partner, okay, first thing tomorrow or I will. And tonight just get off my back, okay? Easy, easy, I'm the friendliest guy in my zip code. I like debutantes, okay? - Who's in charge here? - Sergeant is outside. Line up the witnesses. Separate them. Detective Quinn and I will take their statements, keep them apart. If they want to use the toilet, take them downstairs to the deli, understand? - And accompany them. - Got you. Where's the victim? Upstairs in his bedroom. The name is Carlos Galanter. Never get out of the boat while it's rocking. The victim will still be dead in the morning. You said victim. This is an OD. Certain things you learn as a cop, Quinn. You learn love doesn't last forever and you only get your name in the paper when you shoot the wrong guy. And you learn nobody gets naked just to shoot heroine. Tie folded neatly at the foot of the bed there. Huhuh. You got the jones, you don't take time to fold you clothes. No other needle marks. This is his first hit. Naked? No? Somebody wants us to think it's an OD. See, unlike other indoor sports, Quinn you don't got to be naked to shoot heroine. What do you think of homocide? Everything you expected? Some of the guests are getting hysterical. Let them. I love to see hysterical rich people. Yeah, but there's a doctor who says he has an emergency. Has to go to the hospital he says. Told him he had to talk to a detective. Take him to the kitchen. Detective Quinn will talk to him. When I say do not medicate, I mean do not medicate. Do not do anything until I get there. Is that understood? Thank you very much. Doctor? You're who I have been waiting for? If you'll wait please... If I wait? I have a critically ill patient who is intensive care. Are you the only doctor in New York? At this time, for this man, yes I am. Okay. I'll have one of the officers escort you through the line. If you get a chance while it's fresh in your mind, write down everything you remember. Everything. - No matter how trivial. Doctor... - Venible. - What hospital? - Roosevelt. Detective Quinn, Miss O'Hara is getting sick. I want you to escort her to the bathroom. Quick. She's the one who discovered the body. Thank you. I hope I never have to do that or see that. Want to tell me about it, Christine? It's Chrissy. People call me Chrissy. Yeah. See, I went into the bedroom looking for the John, you know? I'm always looking for the John, and he was right... Oh God. How bad is that cocaine habit, Chrissy? What do you what are you going to do? Arrest me just because I have a runny nose? Sit down. I saw you in the ward. Thank you for staying back. What did you want to ask me, Sergeant? Detective. It takes a long time to be a Sergeant. I'd like to you to tell me about Carlos Galanter. One of the guests screamed. I ran to the bedroom. He was dead. I called 911. Did you know what was in the syringe? It's six in the morning, can't this wait? The first twenty four hours of the police investigation are the golden hours. After that, witnesses forget evidence and it's lost. So you do as much as possible in the first twenty four hours. That's why I'm here now. As a professional, do you think the overdose was self administered? That's your profession, not mine. And as much as I enjoy discussing forensic medicine with you, I have to shower. I have surgery in an hour and a half. Exactly what did you see when you went in the bedroom? I saw the body, exactly. No pulse, no respiration Eyes open, pupils dilated. I administered C.P.R. He was gone. Haven't I seen you somewhere? Did you see anyone enter or leave the bedroom other than the woman who found him? Lincoln Center at concerts. I've seen you at concerts at Lincoln Center. Yes, I have season tickets. Yes, so do I. See, I am observant. And no, I didn't see anyone under the bed. Did you come to the party alone? Yes. And I don't believe it was self administered. People don't kill them themselves that way. Guys, this is Maria Quinn, my new partner Maria. This is Levy, Washington, Knowles, Micelli and Watson from homicide. They are going to assist us in following up on witnesses. Hey, are you going to smoke that at eight o'clock in the morning? No, I'm going to wait until 8:15. I got them to do the autopsy last night. Confirms heart failure due to overdose of... Get this, guys, one hundred percent heroine. Bruises on the victim's chest indicate he was held down while being administered. Which means, whoever held him down, was really strong or really really friendly if you catch my drift. What is this? Jackson Pollack, I think. Very rare and expensive. Looks like somebody threw up on it. Also, signs of recent beating, severe and professional, so we know the guy had enemies. I think the first thing we want to do is run Carlos and the rest of the witnesses through the computer. Here. Where did you get this? I have access to the computer at home. You have what? When I worked investigative analysis they gave me home access. Carlos Galanter. Possession, possession with intent to sell, assault, aggravated assault, prostitution, bribery, extortion a varied and colorful career, huh? Okay. Seven names here known to Narco. NOCU. Quinn and I will take those seven, and you guys divide up the rest. Quinn and I took statements last night, but I want a follow-through. And, guys, these are rich and famous and connected, so insult them only a little more than necessary. We should also talk to the girl who discovered the body. Here we are. Christine O'Hara, 201. Christine said that she went to Carlos's bedroom to use the bathroom. You think she went in to practice heavy breathing a little, and she said, "Here try this for a bigger thrill." And popped main line with pure smack? That's what you think? You got a dirty and suspicious mind, Quinn. I love that. Police! We're supposed to call a judge and get a warrant. - Warrants are for sissys. - You can't just walk in. You want to play by the rules? The rules don't work, Quinn. The rules are not acceptable here. Well, as my former partner used to say, nothing like a little B & E to start the day. - What are you doing? - Just thought I would try it. If that key fits, you could make me a copy. I'm just kidding. She came from Iowa or Indiana one of those states that begin with an I. Here's a picture of Chrissy and Carlos Galanter in Mexico. No names just initials, codes, extensions, businesses. - What the hell is this? - Chrissy? We're here to ask you some questions about Carlos Galanter. What are you doing here? Do you have a search warrant? It would take us about five minutes to get one, Miss O'Hara. Then you get one. Get out! Get out of here! I'm calling my lawyer and see what he has to say! We could arrest you on prostitution, possession, trafficking. Call your lawyer, because we're going to charge you with withholding evidence lying to a police officer, and accessory to murder. What we want to talk about is Carlos and about Mexico and drug trafficking. We just went on vacation. I don't know anything about drug trafficking. How long have you been a call girl, Chrissy? Long enough. Talk to me. I'm calling my lawyer. We'll see what he has to say about someone busting in. Hey, hey, that's not necessary, Christine. We have all we need to know. If we need anything else, we'll call you. Is that all right with you? You have access? Nobody gives nobody anything. Where's your juice, Quinn? I was married to a cop who was killed on the job. The brass gives me anything I want. So what do you want? Getting even for your husband's death? That is why you became a cop? C'mon, Quinn, women like you aren't cops. Women like you spend their lives buying antiques, shopping. You ain't no cop. Look in the mirror. What's the real story, Quinn? You're the best cop in Manhattan, you figure it out. This is Arty, my former partner. This is Maria Quinn. - I'm sorry about the desk. - It's okay. You got to understand, Maria, Cusak and Arty are legends. Always nice to meet a legend. I'll come by once in a while. That was my desk for twenty years. Your husband was Eddie. I was at the funeral. I'm sorry I don't remember. I dropped by your home. We did task force together. You want to check Galanter's phone records, bank accounts, credit card records, income tax forms and look for Columbians. Excuse me, are you still on the job? Maria, Arty and I talk. We're partners, like old married couples. They talk every night before they sleep. I'm not trying to take your job, Maria. I just get, tired of looking at the sports channel all day. I miss the action, you know? What do Columbians have to do with it? The great Seattle windshield pit epidemic. See, a few years ago people in Seattle thought the windshields on their cars were being pitted by some mysterious force. Cosmic rays, laser beams, little green men. Hundreds, hell, thousands of them reporting mysterious pits in their windshield. When they investigated, what they found out was that as the word spread, people started looking at their windshields instead of through them. There's probably some point to this story. One hundred percent heroine, Columbians love to trade cocaine for pure heroine. It's easier to transport and more money in it. A year ago there was a big rip-off at the Liberty Motel in Queens. No, that was... No, no. The guy you want to talk to is Tyrone. - How can I help you? - I want to apologize for this morning. When I lose a patient... Well, I was rude and I'm sorry. Believe me, that's fine, doctor. Don't worry about it. By way of amends, I have two tickets for the Met tonight, La Boheme. And I thought you might like to use the other ticket. I don't want to sound like... it promises to be a really special evening. And I hate to see the other ticket go to waste. Besides, I owe you an apology. No, you don't, really. I'm not asking for a date that's not true. I am asking for a date. I'm asking you for a date. I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but... So why don't you just think it over... I'll have the ticket with me and I'll be at the fountain. You know where that is? Well, I don't finish here until at least seven. That's okay. I'll leave it at will call. It will be under my name. Try to make it, please. Please? I'll try. It's okay. I enjoyed it. The heaviest breathing I get nowadays is when the old lady comes home from aerobic sclass. You know, Vinny, you're no t nearly as amusing as you think you are. I could be. Excuse me. You look beautiful. Please. You do, you look beautiful. Tyrone hangs in this ally. There he is! Watch the car, don't scratch the paint. What are you trying to do, Tyrone, give me a heart attack? I didn't recognize you, Mr. Cusak. When the man starts chasing you, you run. How is your mother, Tyrone? She's been on a new medicine, man, but she hurts all the time, you know what I mean? Hey, Mr. Cusak that's your new partner? Slick. What happened to Mr. Arty. Tyrone, shut the hell up. Okay, okay. There was a ripoff about a year ago in Queens Liberty Motel. Tell me about it. Heavy Columbians in town for part of industrial smack, man. These guys rip them off and blew them away. There was brains all over the place. What are you looking at? Get the hell out of here! Police brutality! Police brutality! Get off me, man! Somebody help me, man! I don't know, man. I don't know. What dudes? Or I'll take you down to the Met Center, Tyrone, and test you for you for real. What dudes? Lysander O'Hara, a real righteous maniac. He's so crazy he would sell you anything that would make you go crazy. - I can't breathe, man! - Get the hell out of here! Hey, man, this man will kill people for two dollars. Where's Lysander? Uptown on some charge. Hey, can you get me tickets Mr. If I catch you again, you're going in for good. - I got Yankee tickets. - Police brutality. Get off me, man. Yankees suck, man. Hey, why don't you take care of that knee. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Get off me, man! Let go of my jacket! You going to pay me? Lysander is a real heavy dude, but he's dumb, you know what I mean? He's got a wife, blond hair all over the place. Whoa. Blonde? Lysander O'Hara, arresting officers? I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold? Quinn. I'm sure I could. I'll find out. Vinny, we're not working tonight, are we, captain? Yes. Eight o'clock, sure. Okay. I have someone on hold so I'll get back to you. Thank you. I'm sorry. What date did they try the case? Could you fax me the court records? Right. Thank you. Lysander O'Hara. Attempted murder, assault, assault with intent to kill, serving time for possession. Know what drug he sold? One hundred percent heroine. Guess who turned state's evidence and sent Lysander to the joint? Carlos Galanter. No wonder you're the best detective in America. Want to know what else? That was Danny I was just talking to, the assistant warden, looked up the visitors log and Christine O'Hara, Mrs. Lysander, visited him twice a month and guess what? Lysander was paroled last month. So, what case do we solve after lunch? After lunch? We go visit Chrissy again. Want to try the deli down the street? Sorry I've got something to do. Thanks anyway. Could we have another mineral water please? - White wine please. - White wine, what? Why not? Want a refund on your taxes. No, no, just asking. Bad day at work, dear? You might say so. Haven't you ever had a bad day teaching and had to answer stupid questions? On second thought, I'll have a glass of wine too. Could you make that two glasses of wine? So, what did you want to talk about? Talk about? Yes. Yesterday you said you wanted to talk. Something people often do when they're having lunch together. Talk about us. You and me. Yes, you and me. That's us. I think that we should take a break. Take a break? This hasn't exactly been a high speed express. Taking a break is like jumping train without having to run. Then I guess there's no problem. I guess a relationship is what happens when you're waiting for something better. You're a good friend. What is friendship basically? No, it isn't basically. Arty used to say the three best things in the world are martinis before and a nap after it. So, Vinny, if Arthur loved the job so much, why did he retire? They retired him. Best cop in New York City, now he stays home all day and watches lawn bowling on cable. She must have left right after we did. The place looks the same. Where the hell is she? - Something is bothering me. - What? When we interviewed Chrissy at Carlos's, she was wearing a designer gown that cost several thousand dollars. Had on a Cartier bracelet, five figures, none of those things are here. Nothing dressy in the closet. The makeup in on the dresser is minimal. Borrowed? Don't you get it? Get what? I get very testy when someone accuses me of not getting something the rest of the world gets. Look, her things are here because this is where she lives, but she works someplace else. Lots of call girls use an apartment. Fine. We will search all the apartments in midtown for a Cartier bracelet; okay? We got to get a bulletin out on Lysander and Chrissy. Then we will cross reference these numbers in this book with the party list. That might narrow down the suspects to three or four thousand. That's what I'll be doing tonight, protecting and serving. You, I presume will be staying home watching public television. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? In the 19th century before anesthesia Speed was the most important thing. A doctor could amputate a leg in two minutes flat. As a matter of fact, in one story, he amputated on patients in under two minutes. Of course the patient died afterwards from gangreen, they usually did in those days. In fact, during that same operation the doctor listed amputated the fingers of his assistant, who also died of gangreen poisoning later on. He was so animated with his scalpel and slashed the coattails of a very distinguished spectator, who was so terrified, that he dropped dead from fright. It was the only operation in history with a three hundred percent mortality. Tennis lessons, dance lessons, piano lessons, the right schools, the right people, the right clothes. I was the princess on a pedestal, but I wanted more out of life. Thank you. So I quit school and went to New York and I auditioned for a Broadway show and guess what? I made the chorus line. And I was nineteen and I was working on Broadway. I was real naive at that time. What about after that? Then I broke my ankle and I couldn't dance. And I met a boy who was a cop. - And you married him? - Yeah, I married him. What happened to him? He was killed. You live here alone? No, the Harvard football team spends the night. Well, I don't mean now. No, just the marching band. Well, then play something romantic here. I'm sorry. Maria... Can I borrow one of your shirts? - What? - One of your shirts. Sure. Right there in the amoire. Why do you want a shirt for? Are you going somewhere? I'm shy. You look beautiful. You do, you look beautiful. I'm not asking you for a date that's not true. I am asking you for a date. I'm asking you for a date, you are who I've been waiting for... Answer your phone, Quinn. What? You think you deserve a life? Meet me at 126 Jones Street off Third. Now I know why no one has heard from Chrissy O'Hara. - Detective Quinn. - What happened to Arty? Up the stairs and through the tunnel. Raped? Well, preliminary inspection shows no semen Bruising not consistent from rape. She was moved. Folded over probably in the trunk of a car. What do you think? Two hours? It doesn't bother so much after a while. Not that you don't care or you get used to it ever, but it doesn't bother you so much later. Here's the xerox of her phone book. There are five names here from her phone book to match the party list. I'm having task force do that, but this one here, see B.R. B.R. Mario's pizza parlor on Mott Street. She likes pizza. I know Mario's pizza parlor. Every cop in the organized crime unit knows Mario's pizza parlor. Most importantly, my ex-partner knows it very well. So we'll stop at Mario's, get some calzone and maybe some answers. A ride in a New York cab can get your spine realigned for free. How you doing? Good to see you, Maria. Oh, Vinny, you look like hell. I got something to show you. Look at this. B.R. Mario's pizza parlor. Benny Rosen is scum, but he ain't no killer. Vinny, what are you doing? Growing a beard? You look like a narc. Shall we? - Sit down, sit down. - I am just having a pizza here. What do you want? Carlos Galanter. Lysander O'Hara. And Christine O'Hara. I can answer that one. The back of a Chevy down by the bay. C'mon - you spilled all over my suit. Stop jerking around or are we going to have to dance on your neck. Hey, hey, come on. - What do you want? - I'll tell you what I want. Tell me about Lysander O'Hara. The guy is a flat-out killer. He used to muscle for Galanter; all right? This guy is on mean street for anybody. I'm telling you, he's crazy. He enjoys killing. C'mon, you didn't hear it from me. Word is he iced a couple of Columbians at Liberty Motel. Now, do yourself and the city a favor, if you see him, plant six into him real quick and good day. Sit down. Christine O'Hara. - His wife, I think. - Yeah? Chisling little whore, snow bird, put fist fulls up her head like it had a leak. What a set of blond hair on this kid not bleached I might add. I carried her a while on the books. You carried her a little while on the books? You wouldn't even carry your mother on the books. Who are you kidding? This is different. See, she paid the best way she knew how. I'm only human. You're slime, you're scum. Get him out of here! Get him out of here! Brotherly love. Benny, talk to me. Sure, just take him for a walk or something. Talk to me. Yeah, sure. Why are you guys busting my chops for some ripoff artist, some whacked out crack hit, and some chiseling little whore. How much was Chrissy in for? Ten grand. It's all paid up. How? When? Three months ago, some paluka helped her, she paid up the principal the whole shebang and all. What was his name? C'mon, I don't take names. What do you take me for city bank? One guy ruins my suit, the other one plays king kong on my face, now you're asking me for receipts. You're going to drive me legit. Ever see this guy? No, I never met him. I just dealt with her. She paid me in cash. I always used to meet her at Gate's at the Embassy Hotel. We're all set for 6:30 Proprietor please. Lady, this is a private club. It's males only. It's not a chauvinistic thing. It's also a high class whorehouse. I'm with vice busting unit. Give me the proprietor, please. Christine O'Hara. You're not in vice. I know everybody in vice. Christine O'Hara. There's no one out by the pool, why don't we go out there and talk? Yes, Chrissy. Chrissy wasn't a fulltime girl. Worked weekends, parties. Could have been very successful, but the life really wasn't for her. A talented amateur. When was the last time you saw Chrissy? She met some guy right after she got busted and quit. Got straight, I haven't seen her since. When did she get busted? - September, August. - Here? No, no, it was an outcall job. What name was she arrested under? You got me, but I might be able to help you with that. Come here. Let me just look at this. Let's see. Chrissy? Thereare her working names. Maybe that will help you. This address on Seventy first Street. How current is it? It was good in August. I called her in August, and she turned me down. Tell me, do you have any idea who this someone was who got Chrissy straight? Some trick with a missionary complex, saving hookers is their advocation. Why is it always on the top floor? Wait a minute. You carry that around with you? A hunch. Good hunch. She was standing here. He held the gun here like that. Put her on the bed. An execution. What are you doing? There's a hair here. We can put it through DNA. What will it prove? The girl was a hooker. She had more traffic than the Holland Tunnel. Use your head He would have had to wash up. Detective Quinn. - The doctor will see you in a minute. - I'm not a patient. - Sit down, please. - I need to see Dr. Venible now. - Have a seat, please. - It's okay. Come in, please. Would you please tell Mr. Collins I'll be with him in five minutes? Boy, am I glad to see you. Was Christine O'Hara one of your patients? Why do you ask? - Doctor-patient privilege. - With me? - With everyone. - What else have you withheld? Is this an investigation, officer? Should I be calling my lawyer on the phone? Doctor-patient confidentiality is privileged information It's a breach of my oath to break it. Only medical information, not the fact that she was your patient. Yes, she is my patient. And I'm very sorry, if you want any more information, Miss O'Hara will have to offer it. She can't offer anything. She's dead. Oh no. How? She was murdered, shot. Oh no. No. No. No. It's an emergency. He'll have to go to the hospital. He won't be able to see you now. My wife's birthday. Anyway, what are you doing here this time of night? Going through records. Main computer shutdown again, so it's the old fashioned way. What records? N.Y.P.D. arrest reports. Month of August. Pandering, prostitution, soliciting, immoral conduct. I checked aliases, AKA's, other burroughs, referenced hotels. She was arrested in August or September at the Hilton, but there's no record. She's probably a niche snitch. The D.A. will expunge the record. It's midnight. Go home. You're probably right. - What are you doing here? - I want you to get in please. Please get in. What I did was to protect Chrissy, not to deceive you. Would you please get in? Maybe I presumed more than you intended. If that's the case, I apologize. I was not casual about us, and I thought that you weren't either. I'm investigating a case in which you are a prime witness... That's not what I'm talking about. Why don't you just say it? I wasn't casual about it either. Onions, mushrooms, and shallots okay? I'm really not hungry. Oh. How would you like to go to the Hampton's this weekend? I've got a great little beach house there, my mother and I. I have to work this weekend. What about Wednesday? My schedule is clear on Wednesday. If you'll excuse me for a moment. Oh no. I like the romance of all of this, but couldn't we just meet in the squad room? I'm removing myself from the case. Here here's a sample of Venible's hair. You can cross match DNA with the hair from Chrissy's. Also, this is a key from his drawer. I'm pretty sure it's the key from Chrissy's apartment. This is from her medicine cabinet. I found it today when I was searching her apartment. What the hell are you doing? First, you supress evidence, then you collect hair from a suspect without Mirandizing him. Where's your head? And you don't get to remove yourself. What the hell is this? Are we partners here or are we independent contractors? Partners are supposed to support each other... Hey, am I bothering you? Then get the hell out of here. You can't quit. No matter what, I won't let you. That was Davidson. They located Lysander O'Hara. What do we have here? What we got eight car unit, four emergency servicemen. The man is located on the third floor barricaded, heavily armed and flat out crazy. Okay. You, you on the roof. Get your guys in the alley. Cover the fire escape. Lysander! Police! Lysander... Drop it. Lysander, stop! I'm okay. I'm okay. Did I get him? You got him. All we do is a job, Maria, not a crusade. You're not required to betray yourself. Don't do that. Look, I tried to explain. I am your partner. I am not going to let you make a disaster from your life. You find yourself someone to love, and if it's good and real, don't flush it down the toilet for a drug dealer and a dead hooker. Another whiskey and soda, double. - Give me one for her too. - No. You're an innocent, Maria. You know nothing. There are a hundred guys with keys to that apartment, at least a hundred hairs on her bed. We got ourselves the killer and he's on his way to the morgue right now. It's over. No, it isn't not for me. Fred aren't you some kind of hand writing expert? Yeah, it's a hobby. What do you think of this? Loony tune. Brian? Brian, what's happened? Come now. Brian, Brian, are you there? Brian, I'll be right there. - Do you know what he took? - No. - You don't know what he took? - No, I don't know. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. You can go now. I'm not leaving. - Give me your arm. Give me your arm. - No, no. There, you see sometimes you just have to throw the switch. The current is still floating. Not easy loving a crazy person, is it? To continue loving a crazy person. I need to know if Brian has ever been violent. He's waking up. I asked if he's ever violent. What do you want? Thrills? Do you expect money like the last one? Last one? Was that Christine O'Hara? All right, so I come here for the corn beef and knishes not the service. Art and I used to come here a lot. Brian Venible's hand writing. Analysis says schizophrenic. Maybe Chrissy knew about it. Maybe she was blackmailing him. Lysander O'Hara killed Chrissy and Carlos too. The case is closed. We got a backlog of cases a foot high and the department is cutting down on personnelle and overtime, and we're not spending any time on this. Capish? No, sell, Vinny. Okay. We reopen the case. Detective Quinn, I'm Consuelo Venible. Thank you for seeing me Mrs. Venible. What is it you want, Miss Quinn? I want to know if Brian is ever violent. I want to know if he's ever tried to harm himself or others during his episodes. Episodes? Is that what you call it? I'm investigating two homicides. I need to know if Brian Venible has any history of violence. Schizophrenics are not necessarily violent, Miss Quinn. They see and hear things the rest of us do not. My son is... Come. I don't understand how Brian can practice medicine, the hours and the stress. Think of it as an air conditioner. You turn it on, you hear the noise. Then after a while, you don't hear the noise anymore. It's there below the surface. Like Brian's voices. Voices? Auditory and visual hallucinations are symptomatic of schizophrenia, didn't you know that? These voices, do they tell him to do things? Stop wasting the city's money. It's no longer up to me, Mrs. Venible, the district attorney has taken up an investigation. You got the other half of this ticket with the time stamped on it? Yeah, in the back office. Get it for me, will you? Got his bank statements. And I got the telephone records. Now we can take our weekend off. Brian, sorry I'm late. It will ne very easy. All they want to do is ask you very simple questions and you give very brief answers. This is the assistant district attorney and detective. The date is Tuesday the eighth. Time is 3:50 P. M. Place is office of Arthur Golden, assistant district attorney of Manhattan. Present are assistant district attorney Cynthia Clark and Arthur Golden. Speaking. Mr. Venible you have the right to remain silent... I would like to know... Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to be represented by an attorney. If you can't afford one, an attorney one will be appointed to you by the court. You may have him with you during questioning if you so desire. Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you, and with these in mind, do you still want to speak to us? I thought this was merely an examination... Yes, I understand them. When was last time you saw Christine O'Hara? On the night that she died. What was the occasion of that meeting? She called me because she said she had been threatened. She asked me to come to her apartment. She was very, very frightened. What did she want you to do? I suppose she wanted me to protect her. What was the nature of these threats and who made them? I don't know. There was a voice on her answering machine that said, "You'll never get away with this. I'll kill you first. "Not one cent, you chiseling little whore." Would you repeat that please? The machine said, "Not once cent, you chiseling little whore." Can you describe the voice? It was a man's voice. It was deep. It was rough, a New York accent. What did you do after she played you these threats? I advised her to call the police. She said she couldn't. I offered her money to leave town. She refused. I told her she could stay at my apartment and she wouldn't do that. She wouldn't let me do anything for her. Did you sleep with her at this time? I don't want this camera going. Yes. And on another occasion, we had been intimate. You just left when her life was in danger? What time was this. 8:00, 8:15. I have a parking ticket here from a garage on Sixty first street which is one block from Chrissy's apartment, it has your license plate number on it. It's time stamped from 7:00 until 11:25 that evening. That's it's. That's it. If you're going to charge my client, do it now. I want a file a complaint. I want a hearing. Save the moral outrage. That's it. I can't take anymore of this. I cannot take anymore of it. I'm instructing you not to answer. I have here a canceled check to Christine O'Hara for twenty thousand dollars. So what was that money for? For drug rehabilitation. Did she go into drug rehab? - No, she did not. - That money was for blackmail, wasn't it? - For what? - Blackmail. Wasn't Christine blackmailing you? Because she knew you were mentally ill, and she asked you for money and more money, and more until you couldn't take it. Until you shot her! Dr. Venible, we can establish your car in the vicinity, the key to Chrissy's apartment and your canceled check. We have no choice but to place you under arrest. We will set the time and place for the bail as soon as possible. It's her! She's the one! Let me go! He said "chiseling little whore." Benny Rosen said chiseling little whore. I told you Lysander killed her. But you had to investigate Venible. Now what? You want to investigate Benny Rosen? Stop it, Maria, the case is closed. But he said, "chiseling little whore." You wanted off the case. You are off the case now. You are taking the rest of the day off and you're calling in sick tomorrow. Or I swear I will go to I. A. About you and Venible. Just forget it. There he is, lady. Brian, I have to ask you some questions. No guns, no guns. No guns. You said the voice on the answering machine said the words, "Chiseling little whore." Can you recognize this? Not one cent you chiseling little whore. She paid the only way she knew how. I'm only human, sweetheart. Can you recognize this voice that you hear? She paid me the best way she knew how. I'm only human, sweetheart. What? Can you recognize this voice, Brian? The other one. What? Which one? "Flush down the sewer." Flush down the sewer. Hi there, come on in. Nice to see you. This place is not so nice, huh. Have a seat. I have a problem I want to discuss with you. I have two murders. First, by lethal injection of one hundred percent heroine, not easy to acquire unless, of course, you have access to the N.Y.P.D. evidence locker. - You want coffee? All I got is instant? - No. A drink? I mix a hell of a Manhattan. No? I'll have some coffee. You keep on talking. I can hear in the kitchen. The lethal injection is supposed to look like an OD, but suppose, just suppose a cop does it while he's on duty. He can answer the call and investigate his own crime, clever. But if he goes to all this trouble, why does he undress the victim and give away the murder? Maybe it's a mistake. Maybe deep down he wants to be found out. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe you don't know what you're talking about. What else? What else is the second murder. A call girl arrested in a vice bust at the Hilton last fall. Guess what? There's no record of her arrest. Who gets an arrest expunged? Who has access to the precinct booking slips so he can destroy the arrest report? - Why does he want to do that? - I don't know. She's a snitch. It's a shake down. Maybe it's love. Anyway something happens and it all goes sour and he calls and makes threats on her answering machine. Not playing with a full deck, wouldn't you say? Right. But the recording disappears. The cop has access to the crime scene. He removes the tape from the machine when his partner isn't looking. I guess the partner is pretty dumb too. I'd say so. And then there's this fall guy, a doctor, who how lucky can you get? Turns out to be schizophrenic. Now we have a hypothetical killer, setting up his new naive partner on the doc and she sells him out all right, according to the plan. The only thing is she falls in love. Not looking through the windshield, but at it. You want to get to a point here, Maria. I mean there they're going into a tie breaker here. This is a very exciting match. What do I do? What you do is be a cop. What you do is deliver your loyalty. Come on, Maria, where's your loyalty? You got any loyalty? To who? To the lieutenant? The commissioner? Your partner. That's where you got to be loyal, Maria. So what you do... you go to the man, you tell him what you suspect. You lay it out. You go along. The blue wall, you don't go over that to the other side, not if you got blood in your veins. I don't want to miss this tie breaker. I don't play tennis I like to watch. Are we communicating? She was standing here. He held the gun to her. The blue wall. You don't go over that to the other side, not if you got blood in your veins. There was a voice on her answering machine that said I will kill you first, you chiseling little whore. You want to play by the rules? The rules don't work. Tell him what you suspect. Lay it out. Flushed out in the sewer. The other one. "Flushed out in the sewer." "Flushed out in the sewer." "Flushed out in the sewer." Come in, Maria. How did you find me? I played the Benny Rosen interview for Brian Venible. He identified your voice as the man making threats on the answering machine. Well, his elevator doesn't go to the top floor exactly, so nobody will believe him. Why did you do it? Money? Love? Love. Sometimes you fall in love with the wrong people. Well, hey, you ought to know that, huh? Christine, my God, Christine. She had you... you know by the groin and she squeezed life out of you and she left pulp. And how you could get away... Christine made me feel... she made me feel. So you killed her? I never killed anybody expect in the line of duty. I think she double crossed you in some way, and you killed Chrissy and you killed Carlos, and you used me as your alibi. You never said one thing to me that wasn't lies and betrayals. I never betrayed you. I never killed anybody. Only a cop could expunge her record. Only a cop could destroy the booking slips. Only a cop could lead the investigation towards Brian Venible. Only a cop... Arty? Yeah. I wanted to kill Carlos, see? I wanted to, but I couldn't. Like Arty used to say, "that's just not in you, kiddo." So he did it for me like any partner would. Why did you want to kill Carlos? Because he was scum. You know I got her in a program. She was six months clean. Oh, Maria, you should have seen her clean. Oh my God, was she beautiful? She wanted it... She wanted to be clean.. I swear to God. He came around tempting, offering... - So you had him murdered? - No. I didn't even know who did it until I talked to Chrissy at the loft. She saw Arty. I didn't know anything until then. I swear to you, I swear to God. Well, what are we going to do now, huh? What do you think? If he killed Carlos for you, why did he kill Chrissy? Chrissy saw him in the loft, she knew he did it. She wanted money from him and from me. I loved this girl so much, and she was blackmailing me. She was a tramp truth be known. We don't have to soil his memory, do we? Oh, Vinny, another betrayal. We can't. The whole thing has been betrayal. Everybody betraying everybody. Me included. I know. It ends here. You break the rules enough, you pay. We're all paying one way or another. So what about your career now, Vinny? Water in the basket. What about your conscience? That concerns me less than it used to. I may have to bring you in, you know that. It's all a series of questions. Vinny, you want to go to the grocer's for me? Vinny, what will you do with your life? Why aren't you ever home with me and the kids? Hey, Vinny, what are you going to do with the rest of your life? So that's what happens, huh? I hope I never wind up like that. You won't be able to help it. I must live a restricted life now. Do you understand? Diet, sleep, avoiding stress. That and my work, it's all there is room for in my life. So, it was casual after all? No. No, it wasn't. It never was. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Never get out of the boat while it's rocking. First, get a picture of the scene. Don't be in a hurry. The victim will still be dead in the morning.
