"Computers are going down. Power is next." "How long do you think till the whole grid is dark?" "Soon. Very soon." "I can't believe they did it." "We found a positive location. We've got them." "Good. Get anyone you can over there now." "What do I tell them?" "As little as possible." "Tell them: someone opened the box..." Dispatch, this is Unit 9. We found them. Northeast corner of the building. Hi. Hey... Hey, I'm looking for Chase... Marshall. He's kind of my height, kind of. Hey. Chase? Looking for Chase... Oh sorry! Um... Hi. Hi... Chase Marshall? Sorry. Sorry! Um... Sorry. Um... *laughs* Palmer? Palmer, is that you? What are you doing here? Asking myself the same question. I mean I know what I'm doing here. Can we talk? We're talking now, why don't you get a drink? A drink? Of what? Uh, anything. We're at a bar. It's what you do when you're at bars... And it's almost Christmas so what's not to drink about? Are-are you... You're drunk! You're drunk. No I'm not! Why are you drunk? We have class tomorrow! (A) it's nighttime. (B) I'm not gonna go. (And C) you need to relax. So let me get you a drink. Oh. Sorry. Guys... This is my roommate. Palmer. And he's... uh... Himself. Hi. Hey. I'm Palmer. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm Palmer. Hello. Hi. I'm Palmer. Hi... Hi. How are you? Can we talk? Someplace else? What are you doing, man? She was talking to you. Yeah I know, then I talked back. You said one word to her, then you blew her off with your cell phone! I ran out of options. Options? This isn't a game of chess. Yeah I know, chess is easier. *laughs* You really are something... Chase, I need to talk to you. So I'm just gonna say it: Dear Chase, you are a good cousin, and I know that we've been roommates for a while, so I should have spoken sooner. Some of your lifestyle choices are tough for me. Always having people over makes me uncomfortable. And makes it hard to do my work. Uh, can we please do something about this while still remaining friends? You want me to stop having people over? Why? Um... They intrude on my work. And my space. In one instance someone set a beer on my desk, and even asked to use my computer for a minute. Oh my god... Has the U.N. hear of these... These crimes against humanity!? Look, you don't have to read to me! I didn't know what else to do. So you want me to stop having people to our room? What's the point of living in a dorm!? Affordable housing? Meeting people! Having fun. No... This is good for you. Trust me, one day you'll thank me. Who knows, you might even meet a girl this way if you'd quit hiding behind this! Could you give me my phone back please? Will you start lightening up? You know what? I can't do this. I can't! I'm moving back in with my parents. What? Wait, seriously? You can't do what? This. I've made up my mind. Right now. Okay... Forgive my saying but doesn't that seem a little passive aggressive? At least back there I could work... Work? Palmer, I thought you put all that stuff behind you. I tried. It didn't work. *sighs* I'm worried about you, man. All that stuff is going nowhere. And I hate to say this, but you're not going anywhere too. And if you move back in with your mom... You're just gonna make it worse. Palmer! Where are you going? We left everything just the way it was. Nothing's been moved. Mostly... Have you had dinner? I can- I'm fine. I just wanna work. Okay... Hey! I am so sorry... You're so late. Don't be late again. Sorry I lost track of time. Yeah. Don't. I'm really busy and I do not have time to waste on- Wait a minute. I know you! You're that kid from Engineering. You work in the lab, right? Mostly... I take care of the parts. I manage the gear- You're like a whiz in that class. What could you possible need me for? I'm not such a whiz with math. Oh. No I guess you're not. Academic probation already? Ouch. I don't know what else to do. Every time I look at this stuff my head starts to spin. If I can't get my grades up then I... I should just quit now. Hey! You are not quitting! My honors points come from me helping you pass this class. So until then you belong to me. Got it? You don't talk much do you? And what is this? Hey please don't- Okay. Don't... Uh... Did you... You made all these? Yeah. Please don't laugh... I mean did you like "make them" make them? Mostly. Hmm. That's really cool. You think so? Yeah. Have you ever like sold one of your designs? Oh. Not necessarily... Okay. So... What is it that you do then? Nothing now. My family won't let me. *laughs* Your family won't let you? What are you? Eight? Since when do you care what they want? Now let's start with last week's assignment. And pay attention because we've got a lot to cover. This is a 'D' Palmer! That is bad! At least it's not an 'F'... It might as well be! You've got one more test to fix your grade and you're just sitting here daydreaming! Listen carefully. You are making me look bad. And nobody makes me look bad but me. I can do that fine on my own, thank you. Now... If you fail that exam... That makes me look bad. Are we on the same page here? Okay. Let's call it a night. And rest up because tomorrow we're going every answer you missed and we're gonna re-take that test till you get it right. Got it? Resting up, huh? You sleep through study and then you scurry away as soon as I let you go. Did you really think I wouldn't notice, Palmer? I can explain! Good! I hope so. Because it seems as if you've been wasting my time to go run off to play... What is this? Look, I'm sorry alright? I didn't know where else to go. They told me I couldn't keep working but I had to! And I didn't know where, then you suggested- Whoa. Where did you get the money for a setup like this? I didn't. You're squatting here? You told me to get out of the house! I didn't know where else to go. Please don't tell anyone. I won't tell... So where did you get all of this? Here and there. Just been collecting it over the years. Years? Yeah. You know... Been doing this since I was about twelve. Twelve? Wow. I could barely ride a bike when I was twelve. Well I'm not that good at it. But this one... This is different. This is the one. The one? What do you mean? The first one to go big? Get bought up? First one to work... Wait. What? Oh! Wait a minute. You mean none of these actually work? Well this one will. I'm sure of it. What is it? Well it's... It's like a radio but it doesn't require any kind of signal. Uh-huh. It uses the background radiation that's all around us as a signal instead of having to broadcast one. It wouldn't need towers or receptors or anything. It would just... Work. And you came up with this all on your own? Yeah. Kind of. I mean I just think of things. Ya know? I can't help it. I can't stop it either. It's what I do... I love it. Are you almost done? Not exactly. This one involves a lot of math. And you know how good I am with that. *chuckles* 'Good' is one way to put it. If this works... It could help people stay in touch. Wherever they are. Palmer, you don't seem like the kind of person who wants to be in touch. Look. I know I'm not really good at anything. I understand that. If below average people can't do above average things... I have to try. Only. Um... Only you need help? I should go. Wait! What if you did help me? I don't know. No no, this would be perfect! I'll handle everything else and you just handle the math! I'm really busy. Helping me with math? This is different. Wait! Wait... Did you ever hear the story of the Scorpion and the Fox? What? When you were a kid did no one ever told you that story? Well it's a story. A scorpion and a fox are trying to cross a river. And the scorpion asks the fox to carry it across. And the fox says "no way!" "You'll freaking sting me!" And the scorpion says "I won't sting you." "If I did that we'd both drown..." So the fox carries the scorpion and halfway across, the scorpion stings the fox. And as they're both drowning, the fox says to the scorpion "Why did you do it?" And the scorpion says "I am a scorpion." "It's what I do..." So you're saying you want to cross a river? Looks it's a dumb story. But the point is... People... People do what they are. You know? And all of this... People do what they are. You know? And all of this... This is what I am. This is what I do. If we can't be who we are then what's the point? Of anything? Plus if you help me I promise I'll bring my grades up. Remember those honor points? Look, if I can't be me, I don't want to know what I'd be. Please help. I don't... I... *sighs* Fine! Only for as long as you stay passing your class. Do you understand? The minute you fall behind I am gone! Got it? *sighs* Okay. Where do we start? Now the goal here is to connect the leads using as little material as possible. Or you risk burning them out. Here we go! Are we finished? We're out of parts. We're still not done? Palmer... Alright, how much more do we need? But that's so much. Are you sure? We can't finish without them. Well where do we get them? Specialty suppliers but I don't have that kind of money! Then where did you get all this? Did you steal all this? Palmer! Have you been stealing this equipment from the school? Great! What are we gonna do now? What is this? Some kind of joke? I had to move in a new roommate because you couldn't be... Normal. What do you want? Oh my god, I've only got a minute so get to the point. Alright! I'm just a little uncomfortable. Uncomfortable? With what? Asking for money. Or being direct. I'm not really good at either. Hurry up, Chase! You're asking me for money? No! No... Yes. Partially. Parts. I need help getting parts. You're still doing that? Look, I'm not interested. So go ask one of your other cousins. My other cousins can't help me. Why should I help you? Because it's cool! You'll like it! *sighs* Goodbye, Palmer. Come on! Let's play! Goodbye, Palmer. Please don't call me unless it's important. This is important, Chase! To me, anyway. Chase... I know I'm not very good at talking. Alright? This would be a whole lot easier if you'd just see it. Please? No promises. None. What do you think? I think you need a new hobby. It's not a hobby. Will this one actually work? I think so. Palmer... This is something. I'll admit that. But we're not kids anymore. I can't keep blowing my inheritance on these stupid things. And you... You need to do something with yourself. Because this isn't healthy. This is all I have. Well find something else, man. You can't do this. It wouldn't take much. Just a few more parts, that's all I need! I'm sorry. Please! I'm sorry, Palmer! Oh! Sorry I'm late. So that just happened. Thank you. Hey... You-I know you. Oh yeah. Econ? Right? Uh yeah. You're the one who always turned your tests in first. Charles? It's Chase... Chase, that's right. So you two are cousins? I'd have never thought that. Thank you. So, I think it's really cool. What you're doing. You know, helping Palmer out. Oh! Yeah. Well... Yeah. Yeah. Well-Well I wouldn't really say that I'm helping. Oh. Well... Call it whatever you want but I think it's really nice of you. I've got a couple more books in my car. No one's ever called me nice before. *groans* This is not a gift. Not a gift... We're gonna make my money back. We are. We are? When you're done with this one, you're not just gonna throw it on the pile like all the others. You're gonna make sure that it works. Then we're gonna make money off of it. Do you understand? We are? Or I'm leaving. Right now! We are! We are. We are... Wait. Night vision goggles? You need night vision goggles? Just part of them. What for? You'd be surprised at the stuff that happens beyond our perception. This will narrow it to something we can work with. You're so weird. All that, for that? What's that? Open it and see. The National Science Board? I don't get it. It's probably the nicest thing I've ever done for you. No way. Chase, no way! The winners get a lunch with the R&D heads of several of the country's biggest tech firms. On top of the prize money! Yeah. You could buy a lot of parts with that. Palmer, this could actually be really good for you. I just want to work. I don't want attention! I hate to break it to you Palmer, but this is how the world works. You agreed to this money on my terms and I say this is how we're gonna make it back. That's final. Do we agree? That's final. Do we agree? We agree... Now, the goal here is to get it to hold a proper charge. For us to build up its power, it has to build a current and then kick in to gear. Like a flashbulb? Exactly. But with way more power. And more danger... Should we be wearing gloves or something? Yeah that's a good idea. Now, to prime the power I'm gonna flip this switch here. Then it will- Then it should build a charge. Once the charge is full, this bulb will light up. Then what? Then we press the button. So what are we waiting for? Courage... Really? *cheers* *sighs* Damn! What does that mean? I don't know I guess the voltage was wrong. Unless your math was wrong? No it's probably me. Let's give it more power. Whew... "Another sunny day in Hendersonville, NC." "Perfect forecast for those coming in for the holidays." Off. "A lot of inbound traffic on I-26." What? I want to hear the news. I want to work so turn it off. *laughs* That's going on Facebook unless I leave it on. Turn it off, end of discussion! Alright, let's leave it to a vote. Palmer! What do you say, man? I think you both presented very strong- Just vote, Palmer! I abstain from voting. If it's a tie... Then I get the tie-breaking vote. And I say 'on'. *sighs* Alright, I'll try even more... Palmer, this thing is due in three days and it won't even turn on. What's the deal? This could send any kind of data: sound, images, information. Maybe even energy without ever using a signal! That will never work. It's a cool idea, Palmer. But you're just pulling it out of thin air. And I don't mean to be a dick but you're not that talented. So why don't we stick with something that's easy? I don't want something easy. God, this was so stupid of me... *winces* *talking and laughter from outside* *yelps* *shouts* *cheers* This should work like a viewfinder. Point it at the desired subject and it'll guide the signal that goes out. Like a camera? Yes. Theoretically. So what do we take a picture of? No way. Nice work. Careful you'll break it! It's already broken! What's wrong with it? I don't know. Here we go again... It's the first device of it's kind, ever! There's an infinity of things that could be wrong with it! You should have listened to me! Wait wait! Go back, I need to re-take that one. Can you get that out of here? This was your idea. I'm just trying to help. The focus was off in that one. What did you say? I said I need to re-take that one unless you want to look like a ghost in it. You said this thing works like a camera. What do you do with a camera? You focus it... We can send a signal out, but if it doesn't know how far to send it, it won't matter unless it's focused! How do we focus it? Make a model of the distance we're aiming, then figure how much power it would take and what frequency to reach that distance. There should be a standard deviation we can find to say that 'X' amount of power into the scope, equals 'Y' amount of focus distance... Can you do that? I can't do that... Yes, I can do that! I don't need to remind you that we only have three days left! Okay it's not exactly perfect. But using the system that Alice made, This wheel will approximate how much energy is applied to the device, yielding a precise distance that it hits! You mean it focuses it? Sure... So how far do you think that is? Uh, probably 400 feet. *computer beeps* No-wait! What?! This is Palmer's idea, don't you think he should get the first shot? *deep pulse* What is it? I don't know, it must be noise or something. No that's not noise. That's a door! That's a tiny logo on the door! You just took a picture of the text on the door across the street! It works! Will it save the image? I hooked it up to your laptop. Everything the device stores is backed up there. Try another one. See if you can zoom even further. It can zoom to any level of detail... Try it and see! *deep pulse* What happened? I blew up the building. Oh my god I blew up the building! Calm down you didn't blow up anything! Somebody just turned the lights off... Turned the lights off?! At the same moment I pointed an electromagnetic device at it?! Oh my god. Oh my god! *gasps* Oh my god... Oh my god! Holy shit! It works! It just has a little side effect. But Palmer, it works! That is hardly a side effect! I'm in so much trouble! What if they trace the damage in the building back to me?! Palmer, calm down! What are they going to do?! Notice that the power's out and deduce that Palmer, who has been secretly working in a warehouse across the street, must have made a device that shot their power out or will they just replace the fuse? They'll replace the fuse. So why does our device do that? Everything runs on magnetism: power, computers, electronics. When the device sends a signal it must interfere with that. Oh my god. If this was used like a weapon it could shut down an entire city. Don't word it that way or I'll freak out all over again! Relax! I just won't point it at any electronics. Problem solved. Where else can we point it? We are surrounded by machines... *gasps* *cheers* Yeah! Look at that! *laughter* Palmer? How much cable do you have for the viewfinder? Why? Cause I got an idea... Okay. So... It should be right around here! That's it?! Yeah that's it. That's Mars. It's so small... *computer beeps* *deep pulse* Whoa! Zoom it in even further. *gasps* Okay zoom it in more. No, let's be careful here- *laughter* That is a picture of a rock that is 80 million miles away from us. Holy damn. Who should have listened to who? We gotta turn this in right now! No we can't turn this in. We barely know what it can do. We made it. It works! What else is there to do? We barely know how it works. It's embarrassing to go public with something that we barely understand! It's due in two days! We're already pushing it. I have to file all the papers for it not to mention I have to mail it in! You're sending it in already?! We need to do more tests! How are we supposed to explain it if we don't even know it? Alice! We just took a picture of a rock that was... How far? 80 million miles away. Give or take. We took a picture of a rock 80 million miles away! What else is there to test? Why don't we see how far it can shoot? Uhh. How do you plan to do that? Can you set the focus distance to infinity? *device powers up* Alice? I know you're more of a math person than I am. But with this kind of test we need to give it more power. Explain. Since we're testing its range, we need to give it enough electricity so that power's not the limiting factor. But right now... We're plugged into a standard wall outlet. And? The main lines would give us more to pull from. Lines? Power lines? No way! We might get caught! You weren't afraid to shoot out a street light. That was different. You can go to jail for that. We have the opportunity of a lifetime here. You aren't afraid to take it, are you? *door creaks* *footsteps* *sighs* This is so dangerous... It'll be okay. Your machine, you get the honors. *device powers up* Now, with this much juice we shouldn't just start at full power. I say we start small and build our way to full power. Okay. Please be careful. Uh... What distance are we at? One million miles. Two million miles. Ten million miles. Fifty million miles. I think that's- One hundred. One hundred million miles. Two hundred million- Everything looks good. *shouts* Can we make this go faster? Can you be quiet? I'm just saying! Alice? What if you set the distance to reflect light years instead of miles? How far is that? Um... A light year is: 5.8 trillion miles. Give or take. Give or take? Would you like to do this? You ready, Palmer? One light year. Two light years. Ten light years. One hundred light years! *device churning* Two hundred light years! *laughing* Five hundred light years! I'm gonna narrow the focus to get more kick! *device changes pitch* See, it's not so bad. Okay... One thousand light years. Ten thousand light years. Twenty thousand light years. Fifty thousand light years. One hundred thousand light years. We're now sending a data stream one million light years across the background noise of space! *device sizzles* Palmer! Palmer! Ice packs! *coughing* Ten million light years. Twenty million light years. Fifty million... One hundred million light years! It's still working! *coughing* One billion light years. Turn it off! That's enough. Don't you want to know?! So you're in on this too now? It's exciting! Two billion light years! Three-three billion light years! Ten billion light years! We-we are now looking further than any telescope has seen before! It's beautiful. *device sizzles* Palmer, help me! Thirty billion! Fifty billion! I think this is the edge of the visible universe... One hundred billion light years. *device groans* I'm gonna-I'm gonna set it for beyond the edge! Let's do it! *deep pulse* *device dies* What? *device fizzles* I think- I think we did something... *heavy breathing* Way to go. You just had to go and push it, huh? I'm sorry. Oh! You're sorry! Okay. Hey everyone, it's okay because Palmer's sorry! Alice, why don't you see how sorry the breakers are? Jesus! Can you fix it? I don't even know. Let me see. *sighs* Guys? The breakers look fried. Like... Expensive fried... I told you... I told you! Oh my god, I told you this was a bad idea! Chase, would you please calm down? Calm down?! This project is due tomorrow! And all we have left is this... This expensive, ruined piece of garbage! We may still be able to fix it, okay? I can't tell when it's so overheated. It may be just the power that blew. The device might still work! Do you really think that's true? Anything's possible... Sorry. I just wanted to see... What about the damage done to the building? The breakers are fried! This place reeks of smoke! They're gonna find out we were here and I've lost all that money! What? I'm sorry. Palmer? We should go. *door creaking* *footsteps* Think I found the problem. There's a burn-out in the line at 101. "101? The old warehouse?" "Isn't that place vacant?" I checked upstairs. Just a bunch of junk. Could have been a lightning strike. Maybe a nest in the transformers. Looks like an old board, wouldn't have taken much. Patch the line. Put in a new board. Just bill the super. Copy that. *device powers up* *computer activity* Quit looking! You're gonna give us away! I just want to see. Should we go back in? Then what? Explain that we've been trespassing? Building a machine with stolen parts and set their building on fire? Palmer, your ideas are on probation! They're gonna find out sooner or later. We might as well just get it over with now. Maybe we don't have to. The machine's cooked. All we have left is the data. Maybe we can just send that in. We might still get credit then we won't deal with this landlord. Just let it go? That data's all that matters! What about my machine? No! I don't want to give up! I don't! We came this far, It would be stupid to turn in a half-finished project! It's not stupid, it's careful! No! Look... The rules say that if by the time that- *computer malfunctions* If by the- *static* What? What the hell? Did one of you drop this?! How could we? You stormed off with it, remember? *static* Drop wouldn't cause this. Did you charge the battery, Chase? Battery wouldn't cause this either. It's electrical interference but I've never seen anything like it. It's running slow too. I swear to god if you broke my computer... It's not us! It's gotta be outside interference. But it- *power lines crackle* Oh my god. Do you think we did this? No we blew a circuit. We didn't fry the whole power grid. But what if we did?! Palmer! If we blew the grid they'll have to replace everything! They're gonna come after me! Palmer! Stop! Calm down! We'll figure this out. Calm down?! Look what we've done! I have to fess up... No. Whoa. You're not saying anything. We gotta keep this under wraps. So we can get in more trouble? So we can let this blow over and finish the contest. If we fess up they're gonna pin the power in the other building on us! And then this too! We gotta keep a low profile. Look, the machine's off... We don't have to do any more work. We're done... So in the meantime, maybe you can keep quiet? And let me sort this out. *sighs* Great. *phone ringing* Hello? "Hello, is this Chase?" "Chase Marshall?" Uh, yeah... "My name is Dolores." "I'm with the National Science Board." Uh, yeah! Hi! "We've reviewed your submission packet" "and there were a few details that caught our attention." "We'd very much like to see this device." "I've arranged for travel." "Can you meet this afternoon?" I'm afraid it's unavailable at the moment. "We'd very much like to meet." "Can we drop by your house?" "You're still at 25 Kanuga, right?" I'm actually-I'm afraid I'm at work. How about downtown? There's a coffee shop we can meet at on Main Street. "I can do that." "It's very important that we see the device." "Do you understand?" "Mister Marshall?" Of course. Sure! Let's just... Meet there... And we'll chat about it and go from there. Little coffee house. Main. Two o'clock cool? "Two o'clock." "Don't be late." *cellphones ring* I don't care if your system is down. I just need to go. I'm sorry sir, just give me one second. Larry, can you come over here? Stupid computer! *more cellphones ring* Hello? Hello? *more cellphones ring* *computer error sounds* *static* Hello? Hold on let me try calling you back. *more cellphones ring* *heavy static* *heartbeat* *device hums with power* Oh god... It's still here! Can you salvage it? I'm not sure. *static* That can't be right. What's the matter? The controls aren't responding. I'm completely locked out! What would cause that? Is it still sending a signal out? No... *computer beeps* Wait. It's not sending a signal. It's receiving one... What does that mean? I don't know. It's not supposed to do that. I'm turning it off. No wait! If you just shut it off will it damage the computers it's controlling? What should we do? I... Palmer? What is going on? I don't know. There are so many options. Interference. Overload... Oh god, what have I done? I shouldn't have done this. Palmer. We need ideas. I have no ideas! I've never seen anything like this before! It's all just guesses! Alright. Just take a deep breath. And just guess. The buffer is full. Whatever this is receiving has totally filled it up. It's possible that the incoming data has filled it so much that it's filling other devices like the computers around town. Can you guess in English please? Whatever this is receiving has filled it up so much it's overflowing into other computers. So how can we stop it? Storage space... We give the device more storage space! Memory. Drives! How long will this hold? I don't know. A few hours I guess. This doesn't make any sense! I don't understand! This can't be happening! This is the only device like this in the world. It's impossible it could be receiving a signal. There has to be some explanation for it. Where was the last place you aimed it? A hundred billion light years away. No that's impossible... *static* No that's impossible... *static* Why is that impossible? That's beyond the edge of the universe. So that's where the signal's coming from?! No! Well yes... But no! It can't be. Nothing can go that fast. Not even light can travel that fast. But this thing doesn't use light. It runs on radiation that's all around us. That's all around the universe... What have I done? Whoa. Hold on, hold on! Are you saying that we reached across space? And... Some thing on the other side of the universe... Is reaching back? No. Guys, look. I hate to sound like a broken record here but that's not possible! Nothing can go that fast! There's no way you could have done that, Palmer. Do you have any better ideas? If you do I'd really like to hear them right now! Please have a better idea... Palmer. Uh, Palmer! *static* The hard drives have filled up! What, already?! You said that would take hours! I know! I don't know! Palmer, what could we be missing? If it runs on radiation it puts out radiation. If we can see that, we can understand it better. So how do we see that? We can't! But maybe we can see its effects. Can I see your camera? Why? The colored glass you have with it- The filters? Maybe they can show us something we haven't seen before. Take a picture. Whoa! What the hell is that?! I don't know... I bet no good will come of it. It's growing. Jesus christ! Hey, guys? You should hear this. "More reports coming in from all over town." "Computers, networks hijacked by some kind of control." "No one seems to know the cause." Some sort of virus or attack cannot be ruled out." Whoa! What happens if you do that?! It's gotta be better than this! "We're getting a live call now," "from one of our listeners. Marcia, can you hear me?" "Yeah I hear ya." "Tell us what happened." "City Hall put up a sign saying:" "tell them if your machines were acting up." "I called in." "Not five minutes later," "men in suits were at my door." "I showed them my office and they" "just started unplugging everything." "Then what happened, Marcia?" "I asked what they were doing. That's mine!" "They said they were taking it!" "That it was government evidence!" Cops?! Evidence?! "Let me get this straight:" "You called City Hall when your computer was acting up." "Someone came to your house and took your computer?" "They didn't fix it or even try to?" "They didn't fix nothing!" "They just said it was theirs and took it!" "I tried calling-" "Marcia, we've got another call coming in." "Very urgent." "I'm getting word that interstate 26" "going out of town has been shut down." "Drivers are being sent back to their homes." "No word on the cause yet" "but this sounds like a quarantine if ever I've seen one!" "Does anyone else have any stories out there?" Oh shit... I can't do this. *device cuts off* *sighs* *faint voices* *whispers* *buzzing* *device powers up* Uh... Guys, it's still on. How is it doing that? Did one of you turn it back on? *static* The receiving rate has picked up. Whoever's sending us data is now powering the scope! How is that possible? For us, it isn't! What do we do now? Uh... Let's just think objectively. Okay, think objectively! Okay... Each time the speed increases, the amount of power coming in decreases by half. The more data it receives the closer it gets to cutting off. So you're saying it'll run out? No, I mean... Maybe it's building up to something. Like a countdown. And then what? Then I don't know. If you were trying to contact someone that's reached out to you what would you send them? A message. Or a messenger? "What I'm hearing is, they're supposed to be" "three young adults, students in some kind of contest." "Authorities say they may be the cause" "of these disturbances and must be located immediately." "If you're listening to this" "please turn yourself in." "A slap on the wrist is better than continuing this prank!" Prank?! They don't have a clue! Turn ourselves in? Maybe they're right. *phone ringing* It's them. Them? Them who? The Science Board. You've been talking to them?! It's complicated. Don't answer it! Hello? "Mister Marshall, you missed our meeting." I was-I was busy. "Yes I'll say you were." "Where are you, Mister Marshall?" Where am I? "We need to see you and this device immediately." Why? "You know why." Hang up, Chase! "Who is that with you?" Nobody. "Mister Marshall, I don't know what you think you've" "gotten yourself in to" "but this has become a government situation." "That must be handled by the government!" What?! You told them?! I thought we were keeping this a secret! I thought it was broken! This is our device. What do you want with it? Are you gonna take it from us? "We'll need to study the device, yes." "To determine its capabilities" "and see if it poses a threat." A threat?! "You have no authority to operate something like that." "Turn it over now while you still have the option to." They want to take it?! "You're in over your head, Mister Marshall." "More than you know." Maybe she's right. We should just give it to them. Who is she? Do you even know?! You're just gonna trust them? What about my machine? I say we keep it. Yeah! It's our machine. We built it. You're just gonna hand it over to them? Wait a minute! We're not qualified for this. And they are?! Someone could get hurt! Are you crazy?! I knew he was, but you? Palmer? Now that the device is hooked up. Can you connect it to a cell phone like we tried? I guess. I would need a number to use. How about this one? Is this legal? Are you actually worried about being legal at this point? *dialing* *static* "We have a problem." "Were you able to get a location from them?" "I was not." "How should we proceed?" "Based on the schematics they submitted to that contest" "I think they've gotten much further than most people." "Including us." "We've closed the interstates." "They can't make it out of town without us catching them." "We'll get it." "I don't think they're running." "I bet they're hiding somewhere." "Do you think they've made contact?" "That seems obvious at this point." "Shit." "Homeland Security is going to have a fit." "I can handle Homeland for now." "Our top priority remains securing the device." "If it's been on this long, do you think-" "Do you think they'll have an encounter?" "I do." "When?" "Tonight, most likely." "In what manner?" "That depends on how far they reached." *static* "What was that?" "It wasn't me." "Don't use this number anymore." *static, dial tone* I want to go home. We can't go home, Palmer. Not now. Then what? We have to find a way to stop this! *static* So... If we can't cut the power maybe there's a way that we can block the signal that's coming in? If this thing can cut across space in an instant there's not much that can get in its way. Do you really think we're being contacted? That someone's coming? I suppose anything's possible. Why now? Why us?! There are a thousand possible answers to that question. But I guess they fall into two categories: One They've always been calling. We just haven't been listening. Or? Or two: We simply haven't gotten to the phone in time. Which do you think is happening? Both? Palmer. Palmer, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. If we're gonna get through this we just need to stay calm and we need to think. Okay? How can we stop it? If this is running on instant data transmission it's unlikely they'll arrive in flying saucers. All the data's being received through the device. So... It's likely they'll end up somewhere near it. Like here. What will happen? *device dies* What was that? Someone cut the power. Guys? I'm here. Palmer? Here. I'm over here. What happened? It's off... What do you mean it's off? I mean it's off. I don't know, you tell me. Quiet. *radio static* Hear that? *unearthly voices in radio static* *radio dies* *heavy footsteps* I just-I just heard something. Over there... I did too. *footsteps* Palmer killed the power earlier. Someone's gotta cut it back on. You're closest. Palmer? Stay here. Got it. *lights buzz* *power dies* *gasps* *static* *whispers* What was that?! I think they're here... I can't see anything! *heavy footsteps* Did she- Did she just leave us? Do you see anything? *breeze blows, door creaks* Ssh. Quietly... *faint breeze* Stars. This is beautiful. *voices* What is that? Maybe this is where it's coming from. But if this is space, how can we breathe? I think we're just seeing a reflection like a shadow. *shouts* Palmer! What is it? I saw something. Barely. Where? *whispers* Hurry up, Chase. Come on, Chase... *screams* *angry voices* *screams* *screams* Alice! What happened?! It-It spoke to me! What?! What'd it say?! I- I don't know! All I could make out was-was emotion. It was one emotion... They were trying to warn us. Warn us? Warn us about what?! I don't know. But we need a better way to communicate. Hey! Maybe this is a stupid idea. But can you hook the goggles to the device and use them like the viewfinder? That's actually a really good idea. Be careful, Palmer! Can you do it, Palmer?! I'm trying! *computer powers up* Got it! No man, this is your device. This is yours. *voices* Okay. What do you see? Palmer? Palmer... Palmer?! Oh my god! What happened?! He-He saw them. Is he gonna be okay?! You saw them? How?! Red! The color red helps. Hand it over. Quickly! *gasps* What's going on?! They're being drawn to the machine. Get some light in here! *wailing* *tortured screams* *angry whispers* *growling* *whispers* Get that thing turned off! I can't! Why not? Because it's disappearing! *voices* We need this place swept. Now! Wait! Look! I think it's still here. But it's not! It is still here. How? It is possible that when your visitors touched the device they knocked it out of our space and into theirs. At least partially. *static* That's not all. Your laptop is still receiving data. Lots of it! They left! How are we still receiving data? They're not the only ones trying to contact you. *static* "Are you seeing this? Are you all seeing this?!" "We're not sure if anyone can hear us anymore" "but we're broadcasting in case somebody does!" "Lights! Lights in the sky!" "All sizes! Huge!" "Calls coming in from everywhere" "some event unfolding in the skies!" "And this city at its center!" Palmer? I'm here. I can see them. They're all around us. They're talking... They're warning me. You shouldn't be here-this is a classified situation! We're staying. Ma'am. I have fifty men combing this town. You have no idea what you've gotten in to. Everything here is evidence! Now clear out... Wait. My friends stay. You said they're warning you? What are they warning you about? These visitors they're just the first of many, many things being drawn to the machine. It's like a beacon to them. More? Are they here now? Not in this room, no. Some are up in the sky. *static* More are coming. These first ones to arrive what are they warning you about? Some of these new ones are much less friendly than they are... Palmer? If the device is like a beacon what would happen if they- if our guests if they took it with them? Could it draw the others away from here? *whispers* Yes. Can you ask them? *whispers* They tried. They said when we turned it on we became an antenna for it. We're tied to it. Radiating its signal. Who turned it on? We did. It was the three of us. They say they can take it away but only if one of us goes with them. No... No wait. You can't! Wait! You gotta help us! You gotta do something! I'll go. I volunteer. They say it has to be one of us. No... No we'll find another way. We'll figure something out- *screams* What is that?! More of them... *inhuman screams from radio* *static* "Shots fired! Repeat. Shots fired!" "Getting word from multiple sources" "we're being told that some sort of skirmish" "has happened over the Atlantic" "Lives have been lost!" "A passenger jet has ditched over the ocean!" "I don't know what's happening!" "Your guess is as good as mine!" "Fighters scrambled to engage lights over the east coast!" *voices* *whispers* "Palmer..." I'll do it. What? I'll do it. I'll go. Palmer... You don't have to do this. This isn't your fault. Palmer, listen to me! Listen to me. This is my work. I did this. It's my decision. I want to. No, Palmer! You don't understand. This is going to get ugly. Somebody has to go. You two belong here. *whispers* I'll go. *gasps* Palmer! *gasping* I can do this... I can do this... Thank you... Palmer! Wait! Goodbye. *voices and deep rumble* Palmer... "This is nuts!" "I'm telling you they're leaving!" "Affiliates up and down the coast-" "Reporting the lights banding together and leaving" "just as fast as they got here" "like a bat out of hell!" "They all circled up and zipped away!" "Every one of them in the same direction!" "It's like they were chasing something!" "As I have more information we'll report it" "as soon as it comes in!" *static* Our director is willing to offer full pardons for damages and trespassing. In exchange for NDRs signed by both of you. Not a word of this gets out. You understand? What about the story? What about everything?! What about- Palmer... An official statement will be released soon. This is out of our hands now. Higher powers are at work here. You made the right choice. Is he really gone? Your guess is as good as mine. What are we gonna tell people? His parents? We signed those papers. We can't say anything. You know they'll bury it. Him. His story. Everything he did. Just lost... Maybe. Maybe not. We signed their papers we've already admitted that anything we say is a lie. Not if you have proof. What proof? They took everything! Not everything... Palmer always said anything is possible. *whispers*
