No! - The reptile! - Shit! - No! - Go here! Come, come here! - Leave me alone! Scum! Welcome to the city of trade fairs Düsseldorf. The metro takes you directly to the trade fair. "Toilets" Fuck! Hey, there's nothing to swear here! And don't break it! Stop that! - Entrance for 30 pfennigs. - I do not have them. How is it? No 30 pfennigs? Can you read? Yes? What are you doing? It's disgusting! What do you allow yourself? Well, he is impudent! So that you choke! - Here! "Wait, wait." Let me kiss. - Hey. - Hey. - Let's go inside. “It's full of plainclothes cops. - Great! - Hey. - You can't stay overnight? - No, of course. It sucks. Damn it! That freak cheated on me the other day. Договорились на 50 марок, а этот говнюк дал лишь 20. Либо он нас дурит, либо мы его проучим. Джимми, не пори чушь. С ментами хочешь связаться? Сначала разведаем обстановку. - Эй, как я выгляжу? - Клёво! Да, да! Клёво! - Самая сексуальная жопка в округе. - Да мои джинсы! В порядке? - Жопник! - Э! Ай, прекрати! - Располагаешь временем? - А ты, часом, не мент? - Хочу пригласить тебя. - Куда это? - К себе домой. - И что потом? - А ты как думаешь? - Знаешь что? За всё надо платить. Обсудим это в машине. Здесь довольно опасно. Дёшево не выйдет. За 100 марок лишь подрочу. - А что умеешь? - Всё! Только без поцелуев. - И в жопу не дам. - Так в жопу не даёшь? Жаль! - Пройдём в местный отдел полиции. - Мент поганый! Дерьмо! Пройдём со мной, дружок! Какая низкая уловка, мужик, корчить из себя папика! Вы на всё способны. Ну и чего вам от меня надо? Stay away from the train station. I'm sick of you scum. Choose your words, or I'll complain to the social worker! - I can arrange your resignation. - What an impudent person. It would sadden me. After all, being a cop is so wonderful! But the business at the train station ... Somehow it doesn't reach you. Do you think I need it? Every day this game: arrest you and release you again. You are not yet 14. You're too young for a prison. But I'll tell you one thing: I see that day in the future when your turn comes and we will get rid of you forever! Man, listen. Your sense of humor sucks. There are idlers, so grab them. And you will not get rid of lustful daddies. There are a lot of them everywhere. And they all want me. If you were a sugar daddy too, I would give you a blowjob for free. Let's get out of here! Quickly! Hey, wait a minute! Do you have the same address? Well, of course, Herr Commissioner: Central Station, 2nd toilet. There is an inscription: "Only hippies fuck Axel." We have to call your mother. She's been dead for a long time. - Hey, buddy! - Drugan! Returned! - I pulled them on again. - The cops are afraid of me. Cool. I didn't give a damn about their entire department. Let them choke on their laws. My Lisbeth, give me a cigarette. I'm out of weed. - I quit smoking. - That's bad luck. How! "It's easier for me to get through the crack." "than withstand this." "Now there is an abyss before me." "All this would not have happened," "stay where I am". "Why would she, innocent," "Was it my fate? Was it rock?" "It would be better if a rockfall or hunger happens." "It punishes for atrocities. Atrocities for atrocities." "I pulled myself into a whirlpool. And this cannot be fixed." - Hi Karl. - George. - How is he good? - Yes. Света добавлю на два киловатта. "Всю ночь душа страдает". - Он талантлив. - "Рассвет едва заметен". "Скрипят приятно ивы, "в рассветном полумраке играя своей тенью". "И ветки словно пальцы". Иди ешь сейчас же. Клади себе сам. По-хорошему. - Нет. Я ненавижу рыбу. - Тогда готовь себе сам. Давай. - Прекрати вредничать! - Не пойму, что это с ним. Не так уж трудно быть нормальным. Давай. Ну, Феликс, открывай рот! Давай проглатывай. Вот, хорошо. Да. Продолжай есть. Он такой лишь при гостях. Феликс! Ешь рыбу! Иначе папа не станет делать тебе подарки. А теперь позволим себе немного выпить. Я хотела бы попрощаться. На Троицу уезжаем, и надо упаковать вещи. Ну, по чуть-чуть. Не сердитесь. Мне надо ещё заехать за ребёнком. Возьмите с собой рыбки. Может, вашему сыну она понравится. - That is unnecessary. - But we will not eat this fish. You might think that we never finished the leftovers. Move the table! Thanks to. Come to me! Go here! Cough up! Cough up! Just spit it all out! Hark! - Let me try. - Spit it all out! - Come on, Felix! Cough up! - Cough up! "Spit it out!" - Yes! Flew out! Yes! - Oh, Felix! Yes. - Everything. Thank God! Oh, finally. Ugh! Everything is fine already. Like this! Now we have earned a drop or what? - Felix is ​​a very nervous child. - Oh yeah! Sometimes moody. - Thank you for inviting me. I'm leaving. - Oh, have a drink with us. Thanks to. Karl-Heinz will stay and continue the evening. - Thank you, Frau Brenner. - Bye. How's the swallower? - This yours? - Yes. - Can you handle? - It seems to be. Yes. So, thank you for being with us. Good evening. It is clear that husbands' wives like roses, they have thorns. It is the same with the owners of the penis. No? Ask your partner carefully in order to see through him. That in itself can be erotic. No? Start a conversation about sex play and his fantasies. Then ask when he last had those fantasies. So you will find out when he last slept with a woman, and what kind of type he is. Gondon is quite appropriate here. No? They also talked about AIDS in the last conversation with their parents. There, doctors believed that it was better for children to talk about contraception as early as possible. I do not even know. Take the condom, put it in the bedside table. There is such a variety of them these days! No? Any color. There are also glowing in the dark. With cloves or honey. And the next day Felix asked me what homosexuality is. And I couldn't explain it to him. Apparently, I have to give the child pictures to make it clearer. Yes, and get used to cigarettes. I am with you, Erica Gailer. Какая радость вам от мягкого пениса, если вы мужняя жена? Зажмите мягкий конец между своими грудями, пока займётесь подготовкой гондона. Мои зрители писали мне, насколько этот способ эффективен. Но! Пока пенис вводится в вагину, он становится довольно мягким. И вот здесь свою эффективность доказала словесная грубость. Будьте погрубее с партнёром. Это сработает безотказно. Станьте свиноматкой, станьте свиньёй: "Боже! Да возбуди же меня! Давай, оттрахай меня! Выдай по полной!" И дайте волю вашей фантазии. Никаких ограничений. Нет? - Стоп! Идём! Нам пора спать. - Ну, мама! Да. Спокойной ночи. - Спокойной ночи, малыш. - Сладких снов. Это же важно в эротике. Нет? На днях она так объяснила Феликсу, что такое гомосексуальность: "Гомосексуалисты спят с попкой". С попкой. Это интересно. Сексуальное просвещение в школе немного выходит за рамки. Ведь так? Of course. I haven't heard of this. Haha. Oh no! No! Repeat, what did he do next? - Mom! Where are the clean panties, pink? - I do not know. Leave me alone! Ask your father when he will appear. Why do you need them? And what are you doing all day? Are you still capable of anything other than shit? Get the fuck out of my eyes! Get the fuck out of my apartment. Let your clients wash your fucking panties. Herbert! Herbert, come out here! Help me get this bastard out of here. Come on! - Come on, boy. Spread the money. - No dick. - Herbert! Teach that asshole a lesson! - For what, mom? You've been skipping school for three weeks. - Not true. - Do not go crazy. Tell me, little traitor, do you not consider yourself my son? Come to me. I would never give birth to such a creature as you. - My friend, you stink. You stink like a rat. - What is the bazaar about? Teach that asshole a lesson. Come here, asshole. Zhopnik. Well? Ay! No! Back off! - Ay! Back off! Back off! - Now I will teach you a lesson! Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! He's my son, stop it! It is good for him. Henceforth science: nothing is for nothing. Since he does not go to school, let him earn by himself. I also substituted my ass. I got out as best I could. And this son of a bitch is only wasting money. You suck beer, and let him earn on the suction. - Dont touch me. How could you? - She herself asked ... Paul? Hey! Do you know what time it is? Agreed: at 21-00, not a minute later. - The film went on for a long time. - Ah, the film went on for a long time. Look at yourself! Fasten your fly at least. - Are you annoying? - What do you mean "boring"? A? Go and brush your teeth. OK? Daddy, don't you love me anymore? What makes you think that I do not love you? Dad, have you seen cool leather jackets? The leather jacket is not for you. Take a shower and go to bed quickly. Don't wake Mom up. OK? - Yes Yes. - What do you mean "yes, yes"? - One strong beer. - Youngsters are not allowed. They cannot only be bottled. Do we dock? Wait outside. Ah, the Cat, he is the ideal for our times! See you. Do you know where our Paul constantly disappears? He came again after midnight. I want to know what he does. We need to be with him more. - So keep an eye on him. - That's what I do. I would like to know with whom he spends time. This is partly our fault. - Why on earth? - Don't act out of yourself. You know that things are not so simple between us. Not to reproach you. How long have we not fucked? Are you laughing at what's vital to me? When will you arrive in the village? My shift at Trinity. I'll try to come on Tuesday. This is the fourth weekend you don't have time for your family. I should have spent a day with Paul. I would pamper him, treat him to ice cream, go somewhere. - I also need personal time. - That is what you want. We agreed that Paul from Trinity will be with you. Hello! Karl-Heinz, how are you? I know it's getting late. You won't believe what happened to me. - I came across the one I dreamed of. - Yes? "Hare"? - 14 years old. The skin is velvet and the face is an angel. - Yeah. Kisses like an adult. Outwardly just perfect. Yes, it's fantastic. But there is one problem. - My niece is coming. Can I see you? - My wife is here. Look, I don't mind if you sleep with him. After all, you also recently gave me young Freddie. No, just not to my house. I thought that your wife should go with her son on vacation. - Just tomorrow. Call in a day. - Excluded. I'll send Axel to you tomorrow. It cannot be lost. Hello Aunt Anette! Here we are. Hey! Hannah! How glorious you have come. - Aunt, can you buy me something? - Oh, later. - Oh, I would like to eat. - First, look at the lamb. - The worker will show you the lamb. Huh? - OK. - We will eat later. - Yes. Couldn't Karl-Heinz look after Paul? - He has a shift. - So send Roman home. - Roman? Is he already here? - Yes! Unthinkable! And how could he be here? You shouldn't count on Karl-Heinz. Let's say he's a relative. Paul is very gullible. He won't understand. Paul! Paul! - Oh, easier, Felix! - Good afternoon, Herr Brenner. May I leave Felix with you? For a while, while I go to the tax office. Sorry, but I am expecting foreign guests. Well. How can we be? You know, it looks like he's got a fever. OK. Can you do it in an hour? - Of course. Thanks to. I leave it, right? - Yes. - Thanks. He'll be good. - Yeah, very good. Felix! It is for you. Look at this and this. On. Take your pick. Hi. I am from the Cat. We must postpone our date. I can not today. Since I came here, I won't leave without the dough. Come in. Stay here a minute. - Listen! - Whats up? Carey? Who likes Beach Boys, David F.R., The Rolling Stones? Elvis! Yes! Me too. - What is your name? - Felix. - What are you doing here? - I came to visit. Me too. It seems like a visit. Hey, you! How many? So that without a scandal, give me 50 marks, and I will disappear. OK. Here. OK. Give me your phone, I'll call you. - My phone is broken. All to you! - Bye! - How are you today? - Hey, you! Give me my jar! I didn't know your chick was on a skateboard. As luck would have it, my mother’s boyfriend took all the money from me. How do we buy a board, friend? - So will you buy me a skateboard? “Not today, honey. - Hey, hey, let's steal. - Where? In a department store. Silly. It's also full of cops. Come on! Coward, don't get shitty though. Who's the coolest here? You know. Let's show them. Suddenly it will work out. My friend, have your skateboard high. - You can only ride one. - My friend, here and buy it for your sweetheart. Let's go. - Chur I'm on the line, and you will resist. - It goes. Cool thing! Yes, man? - And that's all! - It worked, friend! - What you need! - I am delighted! Miracle! Just beauty! - Jimmy! - Yes! Now we are the coolest! Let's show them all! Jimmy! She will simply be stunned! - Hey, look at this! - O! They took it, right? - Yes, I told you that we can. - Who stole? - I. - I. Both of us, of course. Well, you gave it out. Don't go! Painfully! - Whine does not suit you. Let me kiss. - Oh, fuck off! Yes please! Jimmy is not so rude. - By the way, where is he? - I have no idea at all. Hey Johnny! Didn't see where my friend with the skateboard disappeared? This place is not for you assholes. Step on your "pleshka". Bring it down! - I would go to hell myself! - Hey! Scratch and do not bzdi! Disgusting! Complete shit! Jimmy ran off with the skateboard. Can you imagine? My best friend just robbed me. Fuck! “You don’t get so mad about me.” “You didn't rob me. There is still not enough of this from you, dear. - Damn, so the money is needed! - So promote someone. I so wanted to be with you. Spend the night together. Take with you. They don't give a damn to me. I noticed one here. True, he looks disgusting. I certainly wouldn't sleep with him. He disgusts me, and you could do it. Well, he chatted about anarchy, etc. These women are of little interest. Something I do not want anything. Well, since you don't want anything, let's say goodbye. I know a sugar daddy who will let you in for the night. Yes? OK. But only with a prezik. Hi. Axel? You have to call first. I am not often at home alone. - Someone saw you come? - Don't be afraid, everything is clean. Your bunny comes, and you're not happy? Activities. - I'm with a surprise. - Come in first. - Only if the surprise comes in. - Don't be fooled. OK. Then I will sing for everyone to hear. - Stop it, or ... - Or what? Don't be like that with Axel. I warn you. Otherwise I can lose my temper. - Okay, I'm going to call the police. - Wonderful. Call the cops. I'll be here, don't worry. You will like what I tell them. God, what is this? Come on quickly! You deserve a kiss for your discretion. - Hey! - Hey! Go here. Don't curl your face. - I just trudge from Lisbeth. - It makes no difference to me. But you know that daddies can't stand it. By the way, my wife can come back at any time. Fly away! Let's arrange group sex. We'll give you a maman for a couple. You fucked up! Come on quickly, you gotta get down to business. Bunny. Axel! Go here. Here are 50 marks for you. Eat and get out of here. But I didn't earn them. Does not matter. Maybe next time we will. - Mum! - Yes. - Did you have time to crap, thief? - Look, what a mother! "Mom" is like a lady, herself, frame, mom. Shit already! I'll call a doctor. Are you going to pay the doctor? You are a complete moron. - Mom is over. It's all your fault. - Let me out! You stole a skateboard from a department store. - I do not understand what you are talking about. - Jimmy's parents called. They said he stole a skateboard and gave it to Jimmy. Here's what. - I don’t understand. - Interpreting: you gave birth to a criminal. He is a thief. His head is shitty. Comes into the house, devours us, and disgraces. Do not hit me. Don't touch him! He is my son. Dusseldorf. Powerful traffic flow. You have to lift your head to see the sky. We scurry through the streets looking for work. And everywhere we hear the same thing: "The boss is not there." It's finally Sunday. We will do what we want. So let's dream of a better world After all, on Monday to plow again. Today we have Sunday. And we will do what we want. Dream with us about a better world And on Monday ... What the fuck are you singing ?! Is there nothing else? So sing the hymn! Consent, right and freedom ... Above all in the world ... From Maasah to Memel, from Adige to Belt Germany, Germany above all ... It's finally Sunday. We will do what we want. - Did Jimmy show up? - No. We are closing. I was really drunk yesterday. But I won't drink today. Now would be a little coca to start with. I don't want to mess with ... any drugs. You daddies will be kind just for the sake of a sweet ass. Treat us like a condom, throwing it away after use. - And you are an asshole. - And my mother's khakhal called me that. But I like it. - Well, come on, hit me! Hit in the face! - Stop it! I don't need your fuck. Yeah, I have to be cute, with a trademark ass and a hard dick. - Wow! What is it? - Give it to me! Nope. New lover? Ex-lover? "In memory of your son Paula." - Do you have a son? - So what? - And the ass is branded? - I am not interested. From what? He's cute. Don't build a fool. - Would you fuck with your sister? - Yes, but I'd rather go with you. Mom! Good morning. 1. Do not pick up the phone! 2. Do not open the door! 3. Don't make noise. I'll be there after 17-00. Karl-Heinz. No fish. Bad luck. Will you tell me, Herr Brenner at home? No, he won't come until five. Hi Felix! I have a computer game and a color monitor! Cool! - Oh, so you know each other? - Still would! Felix is ​​my sidekick. - Where did you meet? - At the local owner. - So you are visiting here? - Yes, something like that. Mommy, can Axel come to us? I'll show him my computer game. You don't know if he wants to. I'm hungry. And if you give me a treat, then I don't mind. Oh yes. Eat with us. Come and play with Felix. Yes. Come on in, Axel. I'll show you my computer. Here. Wow cool! I can't even believe it. So, take it. - Who are you going to Brenner? - Where can I click here? First here and then here. It's strange that I haven't met you. “And Felix didn’t say anything either. - Mom, let us play. It would be better to play something good. Not this stupid game. Do you have porn? Yes, you quieter! I've seen all kinds of porn: straight, homo, even with horses. And once about how the girl shit at the guy. I almost vomited. So understand what someone likes. Yeah. Now like this and like this. Mode, Felix. Enough games. Learn your lessons well. - And Axel's time to join the Brenner family. - Mom, we haven't even started yet. What a pity! Axel feels bad, he is hungry. Are you sick? No, shitty smoke got caught. - Not my sort. Stupefies too. - Enough. Come on, Felix. Let's go. - Breakfast will be in the morning. - Axel is going to freak out now! If they don't give me something to eat. I hate dishonest people. I may not know who you are, but I guess where these types come from. And I don't want friends like you for my son. Clear? I don’t understand why you got mad? You may not be a beauty, but I would put it in quickly. I don’t know what it means to insert quickly! It's that simple. And the child will say. You are a cunt, I am a cock. Pussy fuck dick. Karl-Heinz is an ass. I fuck and ass. You get high, and I get money. Get out of my apartment! - And immediately! - OK! OK! - Axel is just hungry. OK! - Go away! Now! Felix, no need to talk about it anywhere. I know it's hard for you to understand. But there are things you have to go through! Felix. Who could have guessed this. Don't tell me now, Felix. But, please just nod if I'm right. Okay? Tell me, Herr Brenner ... Tell me, Herr Brenner stroked, kissed you? No! Felix. Oh, Felix! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Oh, it's you! My wife just told me. We need to discuss this. I need to buy a knife. Yes, slaughter a traitorous friend. Or break into an armory take a machine gun there and shoot the hell out. Like Rambo. And then fuck those daddies which gives only 10 marks instead of the stipulated 50. I will put my mother's hahalya first in the list. And then he poses cool in front of mom, to cover your ass. I don't even know him. He is not a father. My father was tall and blond. Sales representative. He always wore a blue suit and tie, perfumed. Well, give a shit! Before, after all, you did not obseral me, you bastard. He will get it from me too. All of them will end. Traitor! Traitor! Are you going to look at her? Traitor! Get it! "Steinstrasse-Königsallei". Exit on the right. Your health! - Good morning! - We need Karl-Heinz Brenner. Who are you? Chief Commissioner Mayer. Sorry gentlemen, Herr Brenner is in rehearsal. We have to wait. We will wait. Please. There is a buffet. Last door to the left. Give me a photo. Looks like this is it. - Herr Brenner? - Yes. What do you want? We want to talk to you. But better not here. It's in your best interest. Chief Commissioner Mayer of the Department of Morals. The rehearsal on the big stage is over. The luminaries gather in the control room. I step out of the shadows. He stayed for 43 years. Now is the moment. I used to be afraid to open up. Exactly. I was forced. Although I have not touched Felix in my life. Albert. I'm looking for Axel, help me. No no. I'm fine. For some reason before my personal life was not so significant. - Jimmy, are you angry today? - Don’t carry it, buddy. - And I don’t think to carry garbage. - I will kill, I will kill him! And also a friend. You can not do it this way. - Where did Axel go? - Dumped with my chick. - Why are you getting lost? - Who will get up on a broken mug? OK. You will have a hut to relax and sleep. And while you sleep, I will fuck you. Aren't you from the Salvation Army? I want to sleep. Who will you sell the child to? To the one who pays more, who gives more. Children from the North Station area don't have a chance find a new home from a wealthy buyer. They are abandoned by their parents to the mercy of fate and are fighting to survive on the streets of Bucharest. They go to great lengths to earn money. Even prostitution. Yes, full of those that are given. How old are they? Yes 11, 12, 13. What's the difference? Anyone for 10 lei will become a prostitute. 10 lei is equal to about 20 pfennig. There are 130,000 orphans in Romania. Poor kids. The state opens temporary shelters. This is our life. Good afternoon, Herr Brenner. I want to close my account. Not happy with the service? I think you are sick of me. So. It will be 7,560 marks in total. - Can you leave 10 marks on the account? - Just give me the money in silence. No discussion needed. Sorry if something goes wrong. And ... have a nice vacation. I'm not going on vacation. I'm going to drive off into the woods with my 14-year-old lover. We'll be there and fuck. Are you satisfied? Have a good day. This? No. Yeah, that's pretty. A? No. And here! And this? The most expensive, as always. Okay, try it on. Wow, I'm hungry! Ready to devour the whole world. Carries! Stunned! Here you are. Bon Appetit. Hi Karl! Hi, George. Buddy Karl, the boss searched you. If you don't show up, he threatens to fire you. I don't even know how to help you. I've been looking for you for two days chasing you like an idiot. Do you hear, Axel? We can't do without a guy! You know? Axel is my friend! Tell the boss to fire me. Yes. This is the best for him. And the most reasonable. Yes. Otherwise, he will be fired. This is just a miracle! We have plenty of time now. Lots of time for love. Yes! You know what, George? Go tell the chief that I am grateful to him. Tell me that he helped me find some happiness. OK? Bye. Unfortunately, gentlemen, Herr Brenner did not appear here for 2 days. Let's shoot! - No. - Come on! How much for 5? We are 10. Flower! Tears him again. - Sometimes it seems to me that I feel sick. - Nonsense. Bunny! - Does it scare you a little? - No. It just feels funny in my stomach. I need to call. And since you're sincere with me, I'll tell you who I'm calling. It's not obligatory. After all, everything is fine. Praise the Lord, all nations. Be happy serving Him with joy. Praise the Lord, all peoples! Do not say anything. Take the bus. He will take you to the Krefeld metro station. Take the metro to the Central Station. You will go to the right side. There Lisbeth will be waiting for you. Here you are. Good luck. Karl-Heinz? Where is my wife? What a surprise. I wasn't expecting you at all. Where is my wife? I think he's walking with Paul. I'm not a spy to know who is where. Anette, Anette! We won't go down for dinner. Roman isn't hungry yet. And later I'll make sandwiches. Kiss Paul for me. Well, tell him that I have already gone to rest. Yes. Let's agree: we didn’t see each other and I didn't talk to you. Yes. OK. I earn little: one trash. We must look for another place. Around full of pidovok! I am no longer quoted. "Lisbeth! "Hello!" Listen, I have to say ... I'd better go to Jimmy. - It's all over between us! - Well, you and a bitch! Fucked up, buddy? - Stop it! - Disperse! I don't like that you park the car in the barn. What else can I do for you? Thank you, Roman. I'll call when you need me. Whatever you do, you do it all fake. Dear Axel himself! How did you get a gorgeous leather jacket? Go, you stole it, my boy. This is the end. This time it's serious for you. This is a gift to me. From daddy. Really? From which sugar daddy? Let's go! Address and telephone if you please. - This is not for you, man. - Perfectly. Then in the jail for teenagers there will be time for you to think. Boy, this will temper you. If you are lucky and get out of there, you will become smarter. For 25 marks. Only 25 marks! You understand? And everything would remain as it is. And then I would hug you. Everything would be so wonderful. Everything is going too well for you. You make yourself on stupid and stupid fagots. Tomorrow I'll go to social security. I'm going to get my 124 benefit stamps. These are my legitimate ones, I tell you. And then I'll walk through Kyo (Königsallei) and buy myself the latest perfume from Dior, so that it doesn't smell so bad here. The stench here, you know, to heaven! Yes, assholes! Look at you homosexuals. Why are you hiding so? No one will say a word. Already sweat from fear on his forehead. Recently, coming here, they came to me! What happened to you? Why avoid the old prostitute? Take a look around. It's about a fulfilling life. One guy is handsome and the other. One guy is handsome and the other, so why be afraid? Cops, or what? This is no longer their business. They now have rationed working hours. Are you getting it? They have been fucking their women at home for a long time, even against their will. It's clear? It’s violence, it doesn’t matter. Nobody sees. And besides, they are cops. And they are considered more in our country. They are considered more. So, take your precious ones and get to work! The night is short. Too short for happiness. Subtitled by Voiceh. 06.10.2010.
