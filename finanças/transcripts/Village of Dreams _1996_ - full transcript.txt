No, there is none. Good luck, I have a lot of fish here. It is because of the river. Yukihiko has a sore throat. And how are you? I feel good. You are not truly identical in every way, then. Now rest, tomorrow we will go to the doctor. Open your mouth well. You have swollen tonsils. The ice pack? It's almost ready. It was the shibaten. But even I have seen it. But you have not heard his voice, but I did. That's why I have a fever now. Say? But why on earth it will be a fever, then... Go to sleep. They are very swollen. Take medicines. It remains in bed for a few days. His tonsils are often inflamed, why do not we take off? Yes, it would be a good idea. We will wait to pass the inflammation. He will be here a week. Here it is fine, Seizo. I'll be back tonight. Let's go. It hurts? You can not talk and neither should you try. If you're bored, read this. You are Yukihiko or Seizo? They Seizo. - And so Yukihiko is in the hospital, huh? - Yup. For you two like to paint, huh? Yup. Leave it as it is. Well, then I'm going now. Stop it! It's a conch shell *? [* Large gastropod monovalve] Me you can give? Then prestamela. Try it, play the third time. Seizo. They Hatsumi. Drawings yet? Of course I do. I love how you draw, especially as you designs. What is it? - A conch shells. - Oh yes? Of course, you want the sound to you? Hatsumi! I'll see you! You are an artist? Let me see. You're good! Are you a twin? Who is your brother? If-i-zo. Seizo. Who is the youngest? He, too, like to draw? Maybe the twins like them the same things, eh? Seizo. Do you think a woman's body is strange? Look good. Look, I do not have pea. Men and women are almost equal. But they are different. I have a major hole in place of the pea. You children are out of there. Your sister is a woman, her body is like mine. Did you understand? What are you doing? Something wrong? Are you hurt? I was trying to make a trap for eels. Do not Cry. Just now do not you cry! Look, strong or do you cry but cry. Give the little man! Where the hydrogen peroxide? The hydrogen peroxide! The top drawer of the chest. Squeeze a moment. You will feel a burning sensation. Keep it up. So you should go. He will heal in a few days. Go and get an eel. Seizo! What do you have? It's nothing. What happened? I cut myself. Who bandaged you? Pope. Pope? Let me know if there are changes in his condition. Yes thanks. Toshie. For you... Oh, it's nothing. Jimma what he left Toshie? It was a miser, that. Probably nothing. I'm sure that has something left. Maybe not a material thing. You did not hear? He had already given his house to Toshie. Those people are not the twins will be very happy. They knew. They left his woods. Jimma was more correct than it seemed. Look there! His spirit is rising. Hey, get out of the way! Arrives! Who did it? Who did this? It's a joke cowardly, inexcusable. Who did it? We face forward! Seizo! Yukihiko! You were you twins? Senji. Get up! You must have been you! And who else? And do not stare. Your behavior is infecting the whole school. But I'll make you toe the line. You scum! We will begin fractions. Open the book to page 20. If you do not have the book, it does not matter. Senji, you do not. Forget this lesson. Go straight home. Why did you bother to come? The pages 10 to 20 were in the house, right? I expect all of you have done your homework. Yes, we have made them. Shut up! It was our fault. But the other children were silent. Hatsumi stared at me. Poor Senji! We're going to pick the berries. It's too early. Let's check. You go. Come on, stand here and who is it for? Hey! What are you doing? Who can do such a thing? Now I can not walk in my fields. No, no. You must make sure you can understand... who is faster than another. You come here. You go back. TOMOZO, go back. Yukihiko, you go there. You know how it will end! He will lose for sure. Well, so you're set. Next. On your marks! Yukihiko! Why did not you busy? Stop! Fools! Stupid! Fools! Jerks! Stop! Stop! I said enough! I'm back. The grandson of Ushibamba not find his shoes, huh? So you gave her the money? Instead of rice, this time? Yup This time I'll deal with the principal! But never mind! It will also be a veteran, but this time he has gone too far. They must not get to throw the shoes. Seizo, why are you wearing with Yukihiko to throw your shoes? It was not about you. Well... Tell me. Before I knew it... Speak out! I do not know why! I did it with Yukihiko enough! Give us your shoes! You take off, Senji! You want to fight ?! Can I come to you? Come then now. Another day. How about Sunday? Sure? We will wait you. We'll see you Sunday. Seizo, Yukihiko. I have come, as we agreed. Switch between front. Seizo, come here. We can not let that guy. Tell him to leave. Because? Do not argue and tell him so. I get it, I expected it. Senji Why can not enter? Usually you like all children. Why not Senji? Where Senji? It is not here yet? Yes, but my mother... Mom? What he said? Not to let him enter. Why not? I do not know. Soffiaci, no? Senji never returned to school. No one knew where he had gone and what happened to him. The nandina berries. Put the other. We check the last trap. Where? Over there. Who...? Who was? It's terrible! He fled alone! They had not stolen, then. A bamboo pheasant! We got lost, huh? Where we are? Let's go down. They're boiling mulberry paper. Keep Hatsumi. That is Hatsumi. Eat them, are sweet potatoes. Thank you! Is it your house? Yup. What are you doing? See you later. Sorry... I cooked this, I hope you enjoy it. Of course! Thank you very much. I have many dusters, usatene well as anyone. Thank you again. So Hatsumi gave you the sweet potatoes? And where are they? The we eat. The next time you take a lot of birds. I'll eat it too, right? Of course, we will take them. We go! - Good day. - I'll see you! Statele far, he has lice. She's crying, it hurts his foot. He scraped his foot? The last name is 'Yagiagi', why she cries like a goat. [Yagi: in Japanese also means goat] Beeeh, beeeh, like a goat! He is bleating. What happens? Anything. We sing, we play. Let's enjoy these summer days. You're right, you're right. Why do not we rest? Yes, let us rest. They gathered around a table. The tea was served on the table. And there was a fruit plate. All happy feasted. Even a fruit plate. All happy banchettarno. Clusters delicious, sparkling apple. Grasshoppers live happily. It is easy to convince them with these words. Three ants came slowly. Each carried a heavy weight. Senji... Have you got a fever. Does it hurt your throat? Yup. And the eyes? I'm OK. Maybe you should get her tonsils you too. I'll take him to the doctor. I'll go alone. And I will go with you, huh? We had targeted the eyes, but... We missed the mark. We took the throat instead. We are getting on in years now? Only you're too old. I'm losing my powers. It is useless to complain. It's time now, come on. That winter... They removed the tonsils too. Spring came and then another hot summer. - It is what Senji? - Say? Hey! Senji! Not Senji saw each other again. He never spoke. It was as if it never existed. It looks good. What are you doing, Yukihiko? Move, Seizo! Shortly after, Yukihiko and I began to have vision problems. We started to wear glasses. Since then we have always worn glasses. If I were a tree... my roots would reach into every corner of the village, absorb the nourishment for my leaves and my branches. But now the village... It exists only in our designs. How many years have passed? Nearly fifty. Those naughty twins have become good people. There is no place for us. Where ever we go now? No longer is our land, we must leave. Someone is waiting. But who could expect us? Do not ask me. Let's go then? And where? At our home. Soon! Quick! Do not push! I will tear out the kimono, as well. Just complain, we ride the wind.
