THE PROPOSITION - We going? - Yeah. She really made herself at home, that one. You can soap up, it's not illegal. - Why not? It's between women. - That's not a reason. - On the contrary. - On the contrary? Yes. It would bother me less, if it was a man. Like a doctor? - I prefer a man. - I prefer a woman, clearly. Speaking about doctors You, who are so shy, It doesn't bother you getting naked in front of a man? - Really? - It does. Wait. Except in front of my boyfriend. I would tend to be more shy, in front of the man I love. I wouldn't like him to see me at a disadvantage. How is that? You're always beautiful. But I can find myself in situations that make me look ugly Or vulgar. Like the woman who was soaping up, this morning. I wouldn't want my lover to enter the bathroom when I'm... - Washing you hands? - No, It's not the same But teeth, for example Brushing your teeth. Nothing more repugnant! - You exaggerate. - No. It's absolutely ugly. Anti-pictorial. Painters often show girls who are... Bathing, or... or even sweating! But never those brushing their teeth. - Can I help? - No, have a seat, I'm coming. You see, Camille What shocked me about that woman... Is that she showed her body, without any shame. A beautiful body isn't immodest. The immodesty was not in what she showed, But in the way, in which she showed it. I'm sure she was Nordic. Yeah, maybe. She was blond. - So what? - Scandinavians have no sense of modesty. That's true. They are naturists. What bothers me, is that they are puritanical. But you just said the opposite? That they are immodest. Modesty and puritanism, are two different things. We in France are modest, but not puritanical. -She's the opposite. - Puritanical how? It comes from their Protestantism. Another time she covered herself up to her chin. And this time, she shows everything. And in a fairly shocking way. Look at their paintings... We could also say the same about the Germans. - The Expressionists. - Yes. It's typically Nordic. - It doesn't exist in France or Italy. - What about Spain? Goya, Picasso... It's not puritanical. It's often immodest. Yes, but not in the same way. No thanks. There is always... A sublimation. I know I'm oversimplifying a bit, but... You see, I don't put borders between sex and not sex, as they say. "Sex". What a horrible word to use that way. It's not even French. For me, there are attractive things, and repulsive things, period. And this woman, who soaps up with her bathing suit down. - It was totally obscene. - So you agree with me Yes, but not exactly for the same reasons. I want to tell you something that will definitely blow your mind. Tell me. I'm used to it. I think I'm going to accept to pose for a painter. - Naked? - Yes of course. - Why? - For the hell of it. To enrich my experience. Ah. - I see you're skeptical. - So what, you got an offer to do it? In a way. - Which painter? - You don't know him. I met him the other night, at Anna's. And he immediately asked you, to pose for him? Actually, he hasn't asked me anything yet. We spoke for barely 10 minutes. And it was almost only about music. He used to sing in the past. I told him that I was part of an opera chorus. He's a very interesting guy. You caught his eyes. Yeah, yeah... He's at least 60 years old. No, he didn't look at me as a man, but as a painter. It's something I can always tell. But you told me he didn't ask you anything. He wasn't going to do it right away! Anna told me he was specialist in nudity. And she showed me a very beautiful nude painting of his In the apartment. If I were to be painted naked, that's how I would like it. - Did you tell him? - Who? - The painter. - Obviously not. Besides, his wife then arrived And he was no longer with us. She's charming. And they look very much in love. But that doesn't stop him from being attracted to other girls' bodies. Alice, you will never understand art. I don't like him as a man, He doesn't like me as a woman. I like him as a painter, And he likes me as a model. So, is it a done deal? To tell the truth, there 90% chance that nothing will happen. - But you'll meet him again. - Yes. We even have an appointment, next Thursday at his workshop. You see, there is still a chance. - A chance that he asks you to do it. - And maybe that I accept. Camille, you always surprise me. Hi. Hi. Come in Wait for me. What about your painter, did you see him again? He canceled the meeting. In a rather bossy tone. As if he was so busy, and I had all the time in the world. So I accepted, but today doesn't suit me so much. I could always cancel it myself. - Looks like you're scared to go now. - Scared? You're kidding. No, It's just that I'm realizing that... It doesn't really interest me that much. But you seemed so keen on it! Let's just say that my enthusiasm died down. It was mainly to provoke you. Provoke me? That's a good one. You know very well that I'm used to accepting your extravagance. Because you consider this extravagance? Naturally. So that's why it shocks you, in some way Shock me? No. But allow me to find it strange. And yet, you're basically responsible for this. I'll tell you... If you hadn't looked so shocked, by the girl the other day by the sink. I might not have realized the painter, wanted to ask me to pose nude. And I wouldn't have considered it, To the point of being tempted to accept. I'm sorry, but I'll say it again: It doesn't shock me coming from you. You're pretty. Without complexes. - Shameless? - No. - Exhibitionist? - More like it. No, I would say narcissistic. I love looking at myself naked. - In the mirror? - Obviously. But not in this one. I'm really unlucky That's why I want to see myself through the eyes of a painter... It will make up for it. Don't mind me. I'm telling you, it doesn't bother me! I'm glad you can take on things I wouldn't be able to do. I am me, and you are you. And I understand that you are proud of your body. - You can be proud too! - It's not just a matter of beauty. When I'm undressed, and I'm using this word on purpose I feel something missing. I am no longer myself, But a woman like any other. It's normal. I feel the same way. No, I'm sure. You don't feel bothered. Nudity for you is not private. - You stay dressed. - "Dressed" - Yes! - What are you talking about? Dressed in your nudity. Nudity for you, is another garment. Some kind of luxury outfit, In which you are perfectly comfortable. Yes, maybe. - Hi - Hello! - Did you find it easily? - Yes. Thanks. Excuse me, I'm a little early but... I didn't know the place so... I'm the one who's late. I'm with a supplier, give 10 minutes... Excuse me. You can have a seat - Okay - You want a coffee? No, thanks. Excuse me. I should have let you know. I'll come back. Here. It's a musical poem that a friend of mine wanted to play She was looking for someone your age. - You're a soprano, right? - Yes. Anyway I was confused. I should've said something... On the phone, or when you came in. But the composer should arrive in a few minutes, I thought it was best, that she'd be here to talk about it - It's very nice of you. - Anna told me so much about you. I hope your friend won't be disappointed. In the meantime, if you want, we can look at some paintings. And as you see... I went abstract. And I don't do nudity anymore. Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE
