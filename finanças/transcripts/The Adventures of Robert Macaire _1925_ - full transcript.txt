Robert Macaire and his faithful Bertrand, carrying their famished bellies along the country lanes, had been looking for a lucky twist of fate for a long time. Robert Macaire: Jean Angelo Bertrand: Alex Allin "Beware, mother! Good Saint Anthony let you find the gold coin you had lost, ''and you promised him to give alms to the first beggar passing by." Farm woman: Mrs Maximilienne Max The night promised to be stormy. "I hate to know that our son is out in this weather, "carrying with him the money he earned at the market." "Here is the dwelling of the farm lady ''who betrayed her pladge to the great Saint Anthony. "Anyway, let us don our sumptuous attires and see her." "From this time on, I am the Viscount de la Tour Macaire, "and you, lucky servant, are my butler Picard... "Master Picard, pick up those rags!" "Picard, let us separate from those reckless knaves! "We are two law abiding travellers who are lost and seek a bed for the night." ''I did not feel safe traveling at this hour of the night! "I got 20 crowns for our skinny calf, and the roads swarm with cut-throats." "Granny, have 'ou ever seen cut-throats?" "Have I seen cut-throats! I have met the most terrible of them all: "the infamous Robert Macaire and his partner in crime Bertrand. "Here is their story..." "God be with you! "My gracious master the Viscount de la Tour, and myself his butler, "have been caught unprepared in the storm. "We ask for your hospitality. There will be a generous reward." Suddenly a cry was heard from outside... "The poor girl must have fallen from a boltinc horse." "I take care of the girl, you take care of the horse. "At least try to look useful." "She is Miss de Sermeze, our Marguis' daughter!" Louise de Sermeze: Suzanne Bianchetti "I owe you my life, Sir. I am deeply grateful." "You got yourself into a lot of trouble to get me out of this tight corner.'' "?y father will send for me tomorrow. "If you wish to accompany me, "he will be pleased to thank you suitably." "This stormy wind is a bad omen..." "May peace be upon you. "Saint Anthony, who comes from above to see you, is leased to meet you." "No harm shall come to you. "My companion is a miserly soul whose purgatory is to serve me. " He helps me finding lost gold and silver, "which he smells out like truffles." "Have you any remembrance of a lost gold coin l let you find?" "Let us haste, Sister! Saint Fiacre is waiting outside..." At dawn.. Louise's brother came to fetch the young lady, for he felt a strong and protective affection for his sister. Rene de Sermeze: Nin? Costantini "Let me introduce you to the Viscount de la Tour, "to whom you owe the pleasure of findin me alive. ?My father will be glad to thank you, Sir. "The gates of Sermeze are wide open to you." "Alas! My wife has lost her mind! "She sees the devil and the saints in ever corner of her room." "The storm must have upset her last night. "A good bloodletting and she will be all right." Louise was confused.. The beard, the racket in the hall, the farm woman's sudden fit of madness... But Robert's dashing flair soon made her forget all about these mysteries. The Marquis de Sermeze's hospitality was well known. "My grouchy marquis is getting out of patience, you know. "He's waiting for your boss to play a game of tric-trac." The Marquis could not do without his new friend anymore, who was a first class tric-trac player. Marcuis de Sermeze: ?. Sacha Dulong "How dreadful! My neighbour de Valecure was burgled yesterday. "His wardrobe and jewels have been looted. "They say it was the deed of the infamous Robert Macaire." "The scoundrel! I dare him to come here. I'll make him pay for his nerve!" "?y young fellow, "to fight Robert Macaire one needs a stronger grip than that. " You should practice fencing to toughen up your wrist." The burglary of Valecure was widely talked about in the butler's pantry too. "I shall protect you against Robert Macaire! Let us put jaw traps all around the park, and six men by each trap, each man carrying a big axe and a gun!" "You see, Lafleur? The paths are strewn with rocks. My sister might hurt herself. "You shall walk ahead of her and remove the largest stones." End of the first adventure Second adventure The tragic dance Bertrand realized that Brigadier Verduron had some rights over the alluring Victoire. Brigadier Verduron: Camille Bardou "It is time for me to go. I must do the Marquis's hair..." "I was told to bring Miss Victoire to her gracious mistress." "Victoire, I am ashamed of you! "It is a moral turpitude to love a gendarme! It is a mortal sin!" The Marquis de Sermeze was giving a dance in honour of his daughter and her saviour. Everyone was eagerly getting ready. "This is an unhealthy country: it swarms with gendarmes." "She is a beautiful girl indeed!" "Yes, she is an exquisite being, a divine creature..." "An angel from above... a gem of a maid..." The guests were already arriving at Sermeze. Meanwhile, unexpected visitors asked to see the marquis. "We are sorry to disturb Your Lordship's party, "but the man you accommodate, the Viscount de la Tour, "is no other than Robert Macaire." "Not content with robbing all of Mr Valecure's jewels, "the scoundrel stole a bag of crowns from one of your farm girls "the very same night." "Father, I remember he wore rings which he might not have inherited!" "Brigadier Verduron has noted that the so-called Picard "had his pockets full of watches." "Gentlemen, my house is now full of guests. "I ask you to avoid a scanda "Rene, help these gentlemen apprehend that rascal of a butler in the pantry. "As for the Viscount, we will attend upon him once the guests are away. The duty of apprehending Bertrand fell to Brigadier Verduron. All the ways out of the castle's main wing were thoroughly guarded. Jealousy made Brigadier Verduron all the more zealous in the fulfilment of his duty. "In the name of the King, open this door!" "Beware. Victoire! "They say you're hiding a highwayman who pretends to be Picard, a butler." "Victoire, this is a family secret! "I am the victim of an odious conspiracy which you must help me foil." Bertrand's only thought was to warn his master, unaware of the threat he was facing. "Fate is strangely capricious, Louise! "You are noble and wealthy, and my only wealth is my name. "I love you but cannot ask for your hand." "The injustice of fate matters little. "A gentleman with a clear conscience is wealthy enough, "and I think my father would agree to that." "Ah! Louise, I am not worthy of you..." "Father, I beg of you! Don't let that rascal harass my sister." "I don't want any scandal, I tell you. "I don't want Louise to know that the man who saved her life is a criminal." "My dear Louise, this is Mr de Valecure. "I told him that you would grant him the next dance." "The gentlemen invite the ladies! Get ready for the contredanse." "Would you believe that I was burgled by the notorious Robert Macaire "the day before yesterday? "He managed to take some clothes and costly jewels." "And the funniest thing is, the thief managed to fool a farm girl "by wearing a false beard and a bed sheet." "We've been discovered! "The gendarmes are blocking every way out." "What is the meaning of this masquerade? "I have been hearing the most disturbing hearsay." "Yes. I am Robert Macaire! "And you, Louise, are the only person in the world "who makes me wish I was honest." "I will give myself up to the gendarmes straight away, "but first, I beg of you to forgive me." "Time is getting short! Go away!" "This thing belongs to you, I believe. "I was lucky enough to find it the other night at the farm..." "I do not forget that I owe you my life, Sir. Get out this way. "You owe me your freedom. Now we are even." "We are even... Time is getting short! Go away!" "Come, Father. We cannot hesitate much longer. "That crook must have dragged my sister into her room. "Tell the men to get in!" "A terrible headache..." "Would you have liked it better if I had been in his debt? "By giving this man his freedom, I paid off my debt to him." End of the second adventure Third adventure The fatal rendezvous The next day at dawn. My dear husband, have no fear, I have received the 12,000 francs.

"Well, well, Mister Officer... "so you were stealing money from the regiment... "Fate has taken care of you. "I will take it upon myself to put your wife and accomplice back on the right track." "Is this the way you protect decent people, Lieutenant? "I have just been attacked, unhorsed and robbed by the infamous Robert Macaire, "who laughs at your police." "We have already caught Robert's accomplice, Sir. "It is that awful man you can see right there. We are going..." "Go after the man who robbed me, now! "Bring him back to me dead or alive "or you can say goodbye to your stripes." "The five of you won't be too many to handle him. "Give me a couple of guns and let me watch upon your prisoner. "If he moves a muscle, I'll break his neck." Did you see Louise this morning? How did she look?" "Louise remains locked in her room, crying and refusing to see anyone, "just like my poor Victoire." "Let us push those sorry thoughts aside. "For the time being, let us concentrate on securing our freedom." In the afternoon, Bertrand went to a tailor's in the nearest town. "Do you know where Captain Mouffetard lives?" Eugenie Mouffetard was all kindness, and very good to her servants. "You mischievous scoundrel! Liar! "You never paid two sous for this lettuce. You kept one sou for you!" "It's an officer from the regiment. "He wishes to speak to Madam about an urgent and serious matter." "Yes, Madam, something bad has happened: "Captain Mouffetard's embezzlement has been discovered, "and this letter proves your complicity." My dear husband, have no fear, I have received the 12,000 francs... 'His Lordship the Supreme Dictator Marshal of the Kingdom's Councils of War "is waiting in the courtyard. "He wishes to discuss this matter with you. "What a disgrace for the regiment! What a shame for all of us Frenchmen! "I wish I could smother the whole affair!" "The only way that both of you could be spared the prison and the galleys... "would be to return the stolen money." Robert and Bertrand decided to devote themselves entirely to what they called their "love affairs". "What are you coming here for, Sir? Either leave or I will call!" Under Robert's charm, Louise had forgotten she was the daughter of the noble Marquis de Sermeze, and every night... Bertrand, who had no such luck, brooded over the darkest plans. "It's them bandits, Sir! They're in the park! It's awful!" "Hurry up, Breton! Bring the gendarmes! "Tell Petit to get us some guns and swords." "These are your father's people. They will find us here. "Go away, Louise. Take my horse." "That's it, I'm in hell! "I always thought that the devils looked like gendarmes." "Let us run away together, now!" "Louise!"
