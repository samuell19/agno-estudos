Once upon a time... beyond the giant mountains and mighty forests... there was a country. Their kind King was living in a marvelous castle on top of the rocks. He had a beautiful wife with rosy cheeks and lovely eyes. Unfortunately, this angel-like Queen had a big problem. She couldn't have a child. My God, red on white looks really beautiful. Please hear my prayer, make my happiness last forever. Oh, Heavenly Father, please give me a daughter with... lips as red as blood, a face as white as snow, and tresses as dark as the night sky. Oh Lord hear my prayer. Your highness! My dear Queen... Surely, the Heavenly Lord will hear your prayer and give us a child. You will be rewarded for your kindness and goodness, I am sure of it! Many days and months passed. It was spring time... it was green all around the earth. Water was flowing like singing a song of happiness. Trees were blooming. Flowers in many colors were heralding the good news. New babies were born. God heard the queen's prayer and gave her a daughter. I congratulate you with my heart my Queen. In this world, a child that is so beautiful is a more precious gift than any other treasure on this earth to me. What will soon reestablish you will make you happy and smile for the rest of your life. My King, I do not deserve so much. I am so happy. There is nothing that is too precious and beautiful for you. It is a gift from heaven, the most beautiful daughter in the world. With such a beautiful daughter, we need to find a Prince that is worthy of her beauty. The Princess is as sweet and delicate as a rose in the meadow. How about we call her Princess Rose Red? No. That is not a name that can give her beauty justice. Her name must be Princess Snow White. Princess Snow White. Very well, my daughter will be named Princess Snow White. I pray that your heart is always full of love for all creatures and they will love you back. My daughter Snow White. While the King and Queen were accepting congratulations for their newborn daughter... the Queen suddenly fell ill. What was the evil force harming the kind and beautiful Queen? Despite all the care provided... she was fading away like a candle light in the dark... and dying like a flower. I only worry about Snow White. She is just a little baby. I don't want to leave her without a mother. I beg of you my Queen, please do not speak of such things, you will get better. I want only one thing from you. Take care of my princess. Don't let her get upset. Surely, one day another Queen will come along. When that happens, do not leave my daughter. Never leave her alone. Give me your word! You have my word, your highness. I swear to God. I believe in you. Now, go bring her to me. I want to see my baby for the last time. A few years passed before the new Queen came along. She was very beautiful, and the... King was convinced that the earth could not be more beautiful than her. But behind her beauty and grace, existed a terrible evil. My Queen, now is the beginning of the ceremony to introduce you to my daughter Snow White. Splendid. The honor is all mine. I feel happy to be the new mother of Snow White. Give word for Princess Snow White to make her entrance. Yes your majesty. My daughter is still very young, and she needs love and affection. If you are a second mother to her, we will all be happy. My King, I assure you, she will find all the affection in my heart she will need. Presenting her royal highness, Princess Snow White. My Queen, I give to you, her respectful care since it has already been from me. The most beautiful thing in the world. My King, I can assure you that I will treat her as if she were my own daughter. The truth was in the evil heart of the treacherous Queen, was a secret envy against the young princess. Nobody knew of the Queen's evil practices. Her lair was hidden in the underground dungeons of the castle. With the help of the sprits of evil, she prepared the elixir of eternal youth. She sought her satisfaction from the enchanted mirror. Mirror, Mirror, of me, who in the land is the fairest one you see? My Queen, you have been the fairest of the fair for year after year. But today you have reason to fear. Since Snow White has come so near I've changed my mind. With her blood red lips, ebony tresses, skin so fair, and beauty so grand... Princess Snow White, is indeed, the fairest in the land. Lies, lies! How dare you speak to me in such a way! There is no other woman fairer than me! Mirror speak to me! Tell me I am the fairest one you see! My Queen, I do not bear false witness. Snow White has surpassed you, and your time is finished. I don't believe you! I should shatter you to pieces. No. That would be a foolish thing to do. The right thing to do is to get rid of Snow White. So, you are the fairiest one of all? His royal majesty! Sorry for interrupting, I couldn't wait to see you all day, my little princess. Not at all, I am glad to see you, my dear father. My daughter, you look just like a fairy today. I'll show you. My nurse said I look like my mother when I dress in white. You look like your mother, even without dressing in white. I am overjoyed by your words, all I've ever wanted is to be like mother. Becoming a great queen, just like her. Yes, she was a peerless queen. Unfortunately, she passed away too soon. I couldn't make her happy enough. Now, all I want is to make you happy. Tell me, is there anything you'd wish for? No father, all I want is to see you strong and healthy. Your existence is my greatest source of happiness. You know my princess... raising a kind child is the greatest happiness a man could have. Even the kings would want this, good night. Good night, your majesty. Speak! Speak! Give me the powerful secrets of the devilish malefic spells. I know! The elixir of death leaves no traces, and no one can trace it back to me. Things are going to change. First eliminate the King, and then Snow White and I will be... the fairest in the land! You are always very beautiful, my Queen. Thank you, my love. I propose a toast for your health and long reign over the kingdom your majesty. Father! My Father! Father! Father! My Father! My Father! Father! Please! Answer me! It's me, Princess Snow White! I beg you please open you eyes. - Where are you dear? - Here I am Father! Right by your side. What happened to you? Tell me please. Father! Father! The King died today, and now I am the absolute sovereign ruler of this kingdom. Those who do not obey my orders will be considered rebels and punished. - Snow White. - Yes, your majesty. Now your rights have changed and there are no longer ties between us. And your royal title of Princess is no longer valid. Oh God! In consideration of the great affection that the King had for you, I will not... send you into exile and you may remain here. But under certain conditions. Your Majesty! From this day forward, Princess Snow White has lost her royal title and no longer has any claim to the throne. Snow White is a servant of the court, like the rest, and will live in a hut outside the castle. Anyone who aids and abets her will be jailed by order of her majesty. Your Majesty, I beg you please not to do this. She's as delicate as a flower. Have pity for her my Queen. The work is heavy, and I am willing to sacrifice myself for the Princess. Guards take this woman to the dungeon! No! Leave me! Leave me! No please! She didn't do anything. My Queen, I do not know how to do any work, but I am willing to obey and do anything you... want me to do. But please forgive my nurse. I'm asking you to please have mercy. Never! My Queen, I'm on my knees begging you please. She is not a human being, she is the spawn of the devil! Enter here. God almighty! Please give me strength. I have no friends. I'm all alone. Help me get through this. Thank you, my friend. It's very kind of you to wake me up. And now they are with me. Now that you are just a servant, you think that you should no longer bow in my presence? Forgive me my Queen. I did not expect the honor of your presence. You still haven't learned what your obligations are. I order you to get back to work. I'm sorry noble Queen, I was very tired, and I could not wake up. Please, my hands are bleeding. - Give me the other hand. - No please, I beg you. Forget that you must obey my orders! I don't want another apology from you. If you don't get back to work, I'll have you locked in the dungeon. We'll see who is the fairest of them all. I will treat her so badly to remove her beauty. Fatigue and insomnia will reduce her to skin and bones. My daughter, you look just like a fairy today. My nurse said I look like my mother when I dress in white. You look like your mother, even without dressing in white. I am overjoyed by your words, all I've ever wanted is to be like mother. Becoming a great queen, just like her. Father! My Father! Oh my God, you are such an idiot and a stupid little girl. As far as I know, your father was a smart person. It must be from your mother. My queen... Because stupidity comes from family just like other illnesses. You probably inherited this stupidity from your birdbrained mother. My queen... I beg you, your majesty. Do not insult my dead mother again... otherwise, I will not give you the pleasure of insulting and humiliating me anymore. What do you mean? My mother and father lived here. This place is full of their memories. I can take your insults in respect to these memories. But, if you insult them, I will kill myself. Because, I would be honored to kill myself, instead of living this hell. Excuse me, my queen. Hold on a moment your highness. What is it? Did you know that beyond that forest, there is another kingdom? Let's pretend to invade? Their Queen does not take kindly to strangers on her land. I do not suggest causing such an unpleasant incident. How bad and how beautiful is she? According to the commoners, her face is as beautiful as her heart is evil. Oh is she? Maybe she's not as terrible as they say. Let's go, I've never been afraid of the Queen. Forward! Go approach the castle! ♪ I was waiting here for many years of any hope ♪ ♪ Why is my luck like this I asked and cried lots of years ♪ ♪ The beautiful days will come ♪ ♪ My heart is an immaculate flower ♪ ♪ A lifetime my heart will wait for love ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is living ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is starting again to love ♪ ♪ I was waiting here for many years of any hope ♪ ♪ Why is my luck like this I asked and cried lots of years ♪ ♪ The beautiful days will come ♪ ♪ The beautiful days will come ♪ ♪ My heart is an immaculate flower ♪ ♪ A lifetime my heart will wait for love ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is living ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is starting again to love ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is living ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing ♪ ♪ What a beautiful thing is starting again to love ♪ - Oh my goodness, get away from me. - No wait, please! I'm not going to do anything to you. Who are you? A magical being in human form? No, I am not a spirit. I am a human being like you. Please, go away. You shouldn't be here. Why not? You sounded lovely. I was hunting in the forest when I heard your voice. It was so sweet. I loved it so much that I was drawn to it. And when I saw your lovely face... Love at first sight. You are beautiful and sweet. You know you can't stay here. Wait! You can't leave me like this. At least tell me your name or who you are. My name... I am a servant. A person who does not have anyone. I will not leave you alone. I have no denying, you can trust me. I must leave. If the Queen finds you here, she will punish me. Just go, please. Remember, I will wait for you in the forest every day. So you can love me, tell me yes. No, I can't make any promises. Why can't you promise me? I'll wait for you. You made a mistake, my prince. If I were you, I would kidnap her. Do you like her, Boncuk? - Do I like her?! I love her! - Me too. Then why didn't you kidnap her? Earning a girl's love is better than kidnapping. Let's go! I was hunting in the forest when I heard your voice. And when I saw your lovely face... You are beautiful and sweet. What do you think, Boncuk? Will she come? To be honest, I don't think so, my Prince. Why? That girl is scared of the Queen. She won't be able to get out of the castle. You are right, but I am still hopeful, Boncuk. Maybe not today, but she will be here one day. By God's will. Alright, you watch the horses, check around, I will be back quickly. Don't worry, my Prince. I will not let anyone come by. Hey, stop! Where is this guy? You idiots! You all failed to catch one man and a little kid! I'll show you! Oh my goodness! Who is that? Is it the Prince? What if Queen hears him as well? Then the guards will kill him! - My Prince! - My darling! My Prince, you shouldn't be here. If they see you, they will kill us both! You know that. I am ready for anything. I am lost since I saw you for the first time. I love you. And I will love you until my death. I give you my word, you will be the happiest Princess on earth. Come with me! Please say yes, my darling. Yes... yes, my Prince. But give me three days. I need to think. I will be back here in three days. May God protect you my love. Have a safe journey, my Prince. Hey, be aware of the Queen, protect yourself. The secret of eternal youth and beauty... can be found in the heart of a young girl who has fallen in love. The heart should be taken out gently with a silver dagger... then it should be boiled down with seven different colors of flowers. The person who eats that heart, will receive an eternal youth and beauty. Alright, Snow White! Now it is our turn! Nothing will ever make me happier than tearing your heart apart! Yes, your highness! Rise executioner! You have a very important duty! Make a hunter costume for yourself. You will take Snow White far into the Tulip Forest... and kill her with this dagger. Then take her heart out carefully, and bring it back to me. As you wish, my Queen. Put her heart in this box. I also want Snow White's bloody dress as an evidence. You can count on me, my Queen. I also would like you to know that I enjoy this duty. I come to you with the Queen's orders. We are to go to the Tulip Forest. To the Tulip Forest? But why? She wants you to pick flowers in seven different colors. Really? Very well, let's go. Here we are. Oh my goodness! What a beautiful place! I wish I was a bird or a butterfly right now. I would like to spend rest of my life in this forest, among all these flowers. I want to kneel, and thank God for all his beautiful creations. I am so happy... so happy that I want to kiss each leaf and flower. I cannot thank you enough for bringing me here. Since my father's death, I never had such a happy moment, believe me. But, you... you seem sad. - Is something troubling you? - No! Aww, please tell me. I would love to help you. - You are such a good person. - A good person? Yes. You are. They say eyes are the mirrors of the heart. You look like an angry person, but... the kindness of your heart is reflected in your eyes. That's nonsense, little girl. I am not a good person. Just hurry up and finish, so we can leave here. Alright, but I cannot harm the flowers. Picking these beautiful and innocent flowers... is a crime as big as killing an innocent person. But, the Queen ordered it. Are you going to kill me? But why? What did I do to you? No! No, I can't do it. I don't care, if she kills me! I cannot harm you! I cannot kill you! Please, please forgive me, my Princess. - Did the Queen order you to kill me? - Yes, my Princess. I was going to kill you, and take your heart and bloody dress to her. Please forgive me. Get out of here right now! And never come back to the castle ever! But, what am I going to do in this forest by myself? How will I survive? The Queen is a far greater danger to you. Please listen to me, go away, get out of here. But if you don't kill me... the Queen will punish you? I'll kill a gazelle, and take its heart to her. Give me a piece of your dress, and I'll cover it with blood and hand it to Queen as well. But if she finds out, she will kill you. I am ready to die for you, come on, let's go. Here, take it. I will never forget your kindness. May God be with you, sweet Princess. You as well. You deserve a great reward, executioner. What do you wish? - Only your well being, my Queen. - Alright. - I will see you in the morning. - As you wish, my Queen. Oh my goodness! Look at all of you. Please forgive my startledness. Don't be afraid. I would never harm you. Come closer to me, come here sweetie. Please don't run away, now I will be living in this forest as well. I can't survive without your friendship and love. Please, I need your help. I need a place to sleep before the sun goes down. Please help me. Where could I sleep, is there a place? Who was that? Was it you? I think you know a place. Where is it? Oh, I see. You want me to follow you. Let's all go together. Oh, my friends, this looks like a dollhouse. So pretty. I wonder who lives in it. Let's take a look. Hello, is there anyone home? Can anyone hear me? I guess there is no one in there, or maybe they are in the forest or just sleeping. Hello... oh, the door is open. Oh! Jiminy Crickets! It is so messy, look at this place. Did you see how small all the furniture is? Maybe... Maybe kids built this cottage to play games. Maybe they come here from time to time to have some fun. Look at these stairs. There should be another room up there, let's take a look. Sleepy... Dopey... Sneezy... Doc. Such funny names. Bashful... Happy... and Grumpy. Yes, yes I am sure these are just some naughty children. But, I still need a place to stay. If I clean all around, maybe they'll let me stay. Come on my friends, let's start from downstairs. What is this? Merciful heavens! A tiny sock. Oh my friends, these must be the messiest kids of all. Socks on plates, and a shoe in a bucket. Let's see what else we will find. Don't worry, we will clean this place up. One even had the nerve to call himself Doc. Doc, huh? Let's see what kind of Doc he is? How are you Happy? I am fine, Dopey. You worked really hard today. Of course I did, dear. Good job, sweetheart. My cute little garbage can. My soul's biggest fan. Sweetie of my life. My little shine of light. Come here you little candle light. That's enough. Stop the nonsense. - Let's go home. - Alright, don't get mad. Alright, we are coming. Hold on guys, there is smoke coming out of chimney. Take cover! The door is ajar! Surely there is someone in there. Maybe someone pulling a prank. What prank? I bet there is a monster in there. - Maybe a ghost. - I hope it is not a zombie. Oh no! It is not a good time to sneeze. What are you doing? Hold on a second, we should all go in together. No way, there is no need to endanger all of us. - Let's send one first. - Who? Dopey. Yeah, I don't think so. Why don't you go first? Because you are the smallest. I don't care. I am not going in, I am not going in. - You will, yes you will. - No, I will not. Friends, this is no time to fight. For better and worse we stick together. We will all go in together. Let's go. Why am I always at front? Because you are the bravest and trickiest. Who, me? - Sure, of course. Go on. - Alright, full cover. Cover full. - Are we going in? - Yes, you first. No you first. You are the strongest. You are the best. We've come to the wrong place. I wonder if this is even our place? Nonsense, I don't see anything different. I think I'm dreaming. Somebody pinch me. Stop it! There's no need for that! Someone will pinch you soon. Who are the monsters? No one else enters this house. Look they have cleaned the whole place. The whole house is spotless. Look at the flowers on the table. Whoever did this has good intentions. You are wrong, there is something strange going on here. There is something scary happening, don't you understand? Scram! They're attacking us! Don't run away, close the door so they can't get out. My goodness, where am I? They are pulling the door. Open the door! It's me you idiots! Don't open the door to him. The best thing is to run away! It won't find us in the woods. Run everyone! I'm gonna beat them up! Stop it's me! Don't be afraid. Shame on all you. I can't believe you left me in there with the monster. - What did it look like? - Did it have horns? I didn't see it, I just heard the sounds of wings. Well then so we will all go inside and find this monster. - No I'm afraid. - Don't be afraid, we're right behind you. We have to light a candle. This is your job Dopey. Go on. We will find the thing that scared you. Look at the birds and rabbits. Oh my, the cute animals scared us. Maybe they cleaned the house. No, it can't be true. Animals couldn't have cleaned the house. Then who did? Good question. I FOUND IT! The troll who came into our house. - Where? - Upstairs. In our bedroom. Dopey, go upstairs immediately and bring them down here by force. No! There you go again! Picking on little me! I always do everything around here! He does have a point. Fine. I will go ahead of you, and you all will follow me. Oh no! It's the sound of the troll. Oh Dopey, go up the stairs. Why is it always me? Go on. Be a man! Why is the candle shaking? Shhhhh. Well? You go first. What's in there? I don't see anything. If you don't see anything then go on in. Oh my! How beautiful is she? She's not a troll, she's an angel. She has such beautiful raven hair and cherry red lips. She's not an angel, she's a demon. She'll be nothing but trouble to us. Don't say that. See how nice she is? She looks just like a Princess. Yes! She does. Stop! Please don't run away. You don't need to be afraid of me. I am just a guest in your house. I hope you will accept me. Don't tell me who you are, I think I can guess... you are Doc. I'm guessing, you are Dopey. And you... with that glower on your face, you must be Grumpy. With your display of fatigue you must be Sleepy. With a vivacious and contagious smile like that, you can only be Happy. I can't see your face. But that look of shyness tells me that you are Bashful. And you, who sneezes a lot, you are Sneezy. Well she knew who we are, let's ask her who she is. Who are you and what are you doing in our house? Oh of course, my name is Snow White. SNOW WHITE THE PRINCESS?! Yes, that's right. I'm the leader here, and I speak for all of us. - We are all happ... - Mad and angry! No. We are all happy. I'm not happy. - Be respectful! - No! Please don't do that. If I tell you what happened to me, you will understand. And maybe you could help me. You see... my mother died when I was a baby. After that my father married another woman... She should go! If the Queen finds her here, she will kill us all. But the Queen doesn't know she's here. What if she does? Think of what she'll do to us for aiding and abetting her. If she stays here the Queen will not find her. And she'll earn her keep by cooking us meals, washing our clothes, and cleaning the house. I don't want to cause any arguments amongst all of you. So I've made up my mind to leave. Goodbye. Wait a moment. Can you make Apple Brown Betty's? Absolutely! I can make all sorts of food: Smoked Lake Trout to sweet Baklava. Sounds delicious! I love Baklava! Very well. If you can do all that for us, you can stay here. Thank you with all my heart. Now how about I make you all some dinner. Do you all like cabbage soup? - I like that very much! - Me too. Our stomachs are so hungry! Splendid. Now I would appreciate it if everyone could please go wash their hands before dinner time. Go on. - Do you want to wash your hands? - No! Please, you should wash your hands. I don't like washing. I will get sick if I do. You will not get sick, I promise. Fine! If you insist! Bravo. That was wonderful. I've had so much fun tonight. I haven't feel this happy in such a long time. Thank you for coming to stay with us Snow White. You have brought so much joy into our lives. You complete us Snow White. You won't ever leave us, will you? You mean the world to us Princess. Whatever would we do without you? Believe me, you all mean the world to me too. Even the one who is a little grouchy and sassy to me. Enough with all this jollification! We have to go to work tomorrow. It's time for bed. Yes, Grumpy is right. It's time to go to sleep. Good night everyone. Good night Princess. Where are you going? The Princess will sleep upstairs. We will all sleep down here. Everyone, find a place for yourself. I object! I don t give my bed to anyone! Don't be such a grouch. No. You all go to your rooms. I will find myself a place to sleep. No Princess. There are some people among us who must learn to respect the guests. Go ahead. Thank you everyone. Good night. Good night Princess. You think you're always right. You'll see soon that you're not. I found a pillow for myself. - Give it to me! - It's mine! I got it first! Wake up my friends. The sun is shining, the flowers have bloomed. Oh my head. I am sorry. You had a bad night because of me. No, we are fine. Well, you all go wash up and I'll have everyone's breakfast ready when you're done. You all look like wet chicken. All of you are chicken. Aren't you going to wash up? No. I only wash when I want to. I'm not listening to that stupid girl. You are so stubborn. Why? Don't make mistakes in speaking. If I hit you, you will not be able to. Don't be stubborn. Who? Me? Come on Grumpy. Just wash up. Don't tell me what to do! Mirror, Mirror, of me, tell me who is the fairest you see? You my Queen are ever so fair, but with Snow White's beauty, there is nothing to compare. Liar! Snow White is alive and well. Deep in the forest where the seven dwarfs dwell. You're lying, she's dead! The huntsman brought her heart to me after he killed her! My Queen, when a magic mirror lies it shatters in shame. I'm in one piece, it's the truth I proclaim. I know you are very smart. But let me ask you this, how do you know it was her heart? Yes you're right! That huntsman lied to me! She's not here. Where did she go then? If she is not dead, she must be in prison. You go back, I'll keep looking for her. Okay. Open the door! What is that look for? Why is there fear in your eyes? Did you not kill Snow White? You lied to me by bringing me a false heart. My Queen! For this you should be hanged, drawn, and quartered. But I will spare you if you tell me where Snow White is. I left her in the forest, I don't know where she is now. Believe me my Queen. Kill him! The sentence for insubordination and treason is death. Die! Die! Someday you will be punished for your wicked actions! Shut up you fool! Or your turn will come too. You will see the end just like Snow White. Off with her head! - Hey, Dopey! - Yes. Tell the crew to gather up. Yes sir. It is not time for joking. You grandpa of a monkey. Garbage bin of my life. Let your wrinkled face smile a little. I don't enjoy sauciness. Is that so, my dear? Hey, guys! Doc is calling us, let's go! Friends, I have a proposition. If it is for Snow White, don't even bother. Easy there Grumpy, yes it is about Snow White. You all saw how sweet and kind she is. Tonight, I would like to give her a present from all of us. What do you think? That's a great idea, Doc! How about a golden cart? Since she is a Princess, we should make her a crown covered with jewels. Her clothes are too old, let's give her the nice fabrics... so she can sew a dress for herself. No, I think we should build a bed for her. A bed? That's a great idea! What do you think, Grumpy? I am fine with the bed idea. So, I don't have to sleep in the pot. Alright then, enough mining today. How is going, my dear. Could you come downstairs? What are you up to now? Oh, many things and many more. Come here, and see for yourself. Oh my goodness! I've never seen such a nice thing in my life. One would forget all her suffering and pain in this bed. I mean... I mean, I never had such kind and nice things done for me. It has been years since someone got me a present. Not even a needle. I don't know what to say or how to thank you all. I just... I just want you to know that I ove each and every single one of you with all my heart. Let's split here. We need to find the Princess wherever she is. I believe that we will find her. Even if she is inside the horn of a bull, we will find the Princess. By God's will. Each of us will go in a different direction. We meet back here before sunset. - Let's go! - Let's go! - You are so sweet! - You are so beautiful! This dress looks great on you. You made us so happy, like watching a sunrise. We all are very, very happy. - What if that handsome prince comes... - And takes you away? You would forget us. Oh no, I would never forget you. You all have given me a whole new world filled with love, kindness and mercy. Wherever I may go, you will always be in my heart. But, please be very careful. We are so scared of the Queen. When we are away, do not let anyone in. If she comes here, just run into the forest. She can't catch you there. Don't any of you worry. The Queen cannot find me here. The poisonous apple and sleeping death. Beware, there is only one cure for sleeping death. A person in sleeping death, can only be woken up by a kiss of true love. Just as I wanted, there is no danger in this. The dwarfs will think she is dead, and will bury her in the ground. She will be buried alive! That's your destiny, Snow White! That's your destiny! Look at me closely, my pet. Because, even you will not recognize me, thanks to this magic. Snow White... I will toy with you, like a cat with a mouse. The Sultan of Genies, Fairies and Magic! Reward me for my loyalty to you. Change me! My pet, how do I look? Do you like my new look? What is it? Don't you recognize me? Of course you don't, this is what I wanted. No one should recognize me. No one! Alright, it is time for the apple. As soon as Snow White takes a bite from this apple... she will be motionless like a dead person. And my magic mirror will tell me that... you the fairest of them all, my Queen! - May I kiss you all goodbye? - Of course! - Do not forget about the evil Queen! - I won't, Dopey. - Do not get away from the cottage! - Alright. - Be very care... (sneeze)... careful. - I will. - Don't let anyone in! - I won't, Sleepy. - Be very careful! - Yes, Doc Wait Grumpy. I know it is your birthday today, please let me give a kiss to the Birthday Boy.

No, I wasn't scared. Who are you, ma'am? I'm a poor old woman who came here to rest a little. - Sure, please come in. - Thank you child. I have not rested all night and I still have far to walk. - I'm going to see my little granddaughter who is very sick. - It's ok, please sit down. Bless you child, you have a good heart. If only you knew how difficult it is to walk six miles. You are a young girl. Would you like something to eat granny? No I'm fine thank you. Your basket of apples, they are cute. I have never seen anything like them. Yes, they are beautiful, and delicious too. Here, take one. Out of the kindness of my heart. Thank you, but that's not necessary. What is this? What's gotten into all of you? You can all leave now! Shame on you for startling this sweet little old lady. Come back when you've learned to respect your elders. I apologize if you were scared, they are just not accustomed to seeing strangers in here. - Do not worry, I just had to protect this apple. - Is this one special? Yes. Look at it, look at it, this apple is not like the others. It's the most beautiful of all. What is it all about? This one is an enchanted apple and has the gift of granting wishes to those who own it. Really?! And you can ask for any wish? Of course, to the person who bites her, whatever their wish is, it's fulfilled! Take it, make a wish, and then take a bite. Go ahead, ask for your wish. What's all this! I think it's a warning! Please, what is it? Little bunny, you've come looking for us? What? The evil Queen is hurting her? Hurry up! We've got to save Snow White! Ahh, I get it! You're thinking of someone and you expect him to come and rescue you. I heard you when you sang. - You are in love! Aren't you? - Yes. I would like it so much for him to come here. How much my dear child? How much do you wish? I've suffered a lot, Grandma. And now I would like to be happy again. Yes, I would like that. For him to love me and to come here, because I love him too. Go on, take the apple. Your wish is going to come true. I feel strange. It's the Queen! She transformed herself into a witch. Don't let her escape! Get her! - Light the candle. - I wonder what happened. Maybe the princess is sleeping, let's try to wake her up gently. - Princess, Princess. - We are here. I think our worst nightmare came true, friends. Come, let's take her to the bed. Gently. No way, Doc. Such beautiful and kind girl cannot be dead. It is a trick of fate, the good dies young. But... but, we loved her so much. She must not die. Now our hearts will have a void in them. If Snow White is dead, then I want to be dead as well. My heart is in great pain, I never loved anyone as much as her. She was our best friend. But... but we have to accept reality. May God bless us all. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Amen! I am an idiot, a terrible person. I called her names, and pushed her away. But she still made me a cake for my birthday. Maybe... maybe, I see now that I loved her. Because, she was the first person ever to love, kiss, and care about me. Even my parents hated me because I was a dwarf. But, she loved me. Loved me. - What are we going to do? - Same thing done to all dead people. You mean we are going to bury her? Put her underground? No, Doc. Let's not do that. If we bury her, we can never see her again. Then how could we live without seeing her? Don't be childish. We need to bury the dead ones. I cannot bear to see this beautiful flower decay in front of our eyes. Yes, let's bury her right away, Doc. But, let's make her an amazing grave. No, I don't want her to be buried. Let's build a golden casket for her. Seal it with glass. Maybe without the air, she won't decay and we can always see her. Yes you are right, Grumpy. I agree with you. Let's put flowers all around her casket. Rest in peace, sweet Princess. - May you rest in the lights. - May God opens his heaven for you. May the angels protect you, Princess. May God's mercy be upon you. I know we have a great pain, friends. But, we need to keep living and get back to work. From now on, two of us will guard Snow White. Happy, it is your turn today. And... - Let me be the other, Doc. I feel guilty. - Alright, let's go friends. - A stranger is coming. Let's bail! - No, he would catch us anyway. I do not intend to harm you. I am looking for someone. Could you help me please? - Whom? - Owner of this cloak. Snow White. Snow White? Who are you? Are you the prince? Yes. Please, I beg you. Help me, have you seen her? I am looking for her for days. I want to take her to my country and make her happy. I love Snow White. I love her very much. Alright then. Come with us. - What is this? What is happening? - The Queen... the Queen killed her! Oh God. No! Not possible! My princess. Snow White, my angel. What a shame, you died without knowing my true love for you. Oh my, how beautiful! Like she never died! Forgive me, my princess. I would not be this brave, if you were alive. I want to kiss you. Just once, with all my heart and love for you. My Princess! My Prince! It's you! Farewell, my good friends. I will never... never forget you or my time with you. Goodbye. My little darlings... please come and visit me. - Farewell. - Goodbye, Snow White. Goodbye. - Uh oh. Where is Dopey? - I am here! I am here, my dear. You naughty boy! Come here and let me kiss you. Goodbye, my friends. I'll see you all at my wedding. - We will be there! - Most definitely! Get me a girl. I want to get married! I can't live without a girl, I can't!
