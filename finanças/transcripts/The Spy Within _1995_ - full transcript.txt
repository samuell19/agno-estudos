(tense music) (moaning) - [Woman] I hate you. (moaning) The thought of you touching me makes me nauseous. - [Man] Oh yes, yes. - [Woman] You revolting, ugly, little man. - [Man] It's not good enough, it's not good enough. - [Woman] I will tell you what's not good enough, you worm. - [Man] Yes, good. - [Woman] You undo those pants this second, do you hear me? I want those undone now. Take those pants down now and get on your knees this minute. You see this shoe, look at it, I want it clean. It is filthy, filthy, filthy. You're a maggot, do you know that? You're a maggot and you're scum. You're a completely worthless, ugly, ugly little man. You are so ugly, I can hardly bear to look at you. - No. No, it's not working. It's not real enough. - What did you say? Hm? - It's not real enough. - Not real? - Oh god-- - I'll give you real. - Oh no. Oh no. - You just sit there. - Oh yes. - You just sit right there and let me do all the work. You're just what the doctor wants. - Maybe if I just-- - No. We're gonna have a lot of fun. - Oh yes. - You just wait. - Oh my god, oh, what are you gonna do? Oh, you're fantastic. Oh my god. - Just sit right there and you relax. I'll give you what you want. We're gonna go for a little ride. Momma's gonna take you over here. - Oh god, oh my god, oh no, no. Oh, oh, oh. - Yes. - What? What are you doing? - I'm gonna leave you right here and when that elevator comes, you're gonna be stuck here. And then when everybody gets here for work in the morning, they're gonna find you. And they'll know what a sick puppy you really are. (whimpering) - Oh. (grunting) Oh. (panting) - Bye-bye. - What are you doing? - What's the matter? You told me to leave. (chuckling) - You had me going there. - I wouldn't leave you. Not without taking your picture first. Smile. - What the fuck are you doing? - Hm? - What the fuck are you doing, you bitch? Cut me loose. (giggling) - And I thought I'd seen it all. - What do you want, more money, huh? - More money? I can buy and sell you, doc. - What do you want? What do you want? - A body. There there there, relax. I'll make it easy on you. I'll take a dead one from the morgue. (wolf howling) (grunting) Jesus. (phone ringing) (groaning) Hello? - Hello. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) How do we stand with the auction? - [French Man] They are dull. - Dull? - [French Man] They lacked pizazz. - They lacked pizazz? - [French Man] Why don't you come to France? Oh, you know, I dream about you every night. (speaking in foreign language) - [French Man] You would tell a French man about love? You think I could put money first? (giggling) - Oh, monsieur, you're jeopardizing our relationship. Are you sure there's nothing of interest in this auction? - [French Man] Emeralds, lots 92 and 156. Your usual bid? - Whatever it takes. (speaking in foreign language) I'm so much in love. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Bye-bye. (sighing) (grunting) (ominous tones) Jesus. (grunting) (panting) (booming) (screaming) (panting) (train whistle blowing) Great, full house. - [Announcer] Your attention, please, Train 53 is now arriving from San Diego on track six. (ominous music) This will be the last call for Amtrak Train 37 departing at 9:45 p.m., now boarding through gate letter C. (ominous percussion) (upbeat rock music) - Excuse me, do you have a payphone? - No, we don't. - Do you have any phone? - Yeah. - Do you think you could call me a cab, please? - The phone's just for customers. You want a drink? - No. - Like I said, the phone's just for customers. (sighing) - How about I buy him a drink? Do you have the number for a yellow cab? (sighing) Thanks. (door creaking) - Hey, you got cigarettes? - Machine's in the back, pal. - The page has been ripped out. - I don't know, lady, you'll have to call information. That's two calls. - Lady, don't miss-dial, I'll need a cab myself. - I need change. - Hold your water, that'll be $3.50 for the beers. - Oh Jesus. - Hey! - I got some in the car. - Miss, this guy's partner just pinched your bag. - What? - Jesus. Hey, hey. What is she, nuts? Those guys are gonna kill her. (intense music) - Give me my fucking bag. (grunting) (panting) (grunting) (gunfire) Go, now! (groaning) (panting) - Don't worry about me, lady, I'm fine. That bag must be pretty goddamn important. - It's just that I... I don't have a permit. - Hey, hey. (panting) You need a ride? Goddamn fucking wallet. Come on. Come on. - [Disgruntled Man] What? - I got stopped and I got the guy's wallet. I thought it might help you guys out. - Get out. - Vamos. - Amateurs. - What do we tell J.B.? - There's only one thing to tell J.B., the truth. - Hey, wait a minute. William B. Rickman. Might not be a total loss, huh? - If he's involved. - And she's the Dove. - [Disgruntled Man] We'll find out soon enough. - [Woman] Why won't you ask me? - What? - Why I went after them, what I was doing with a gun, that sort of thing. - It's none of my business. - Then why did you help me? - You bought me a beer. - Right. - [Will] What's your street? - There's a diner up there on the right. I can find my way from there. - You sure? I don't mind. - The diner's fine. Actually, I live about four blocks up on number 601, if you're sure you don't mind. I just want to, I mean... I appreciate everything you did. I'm sorry, I'm not saying this very well. - Thanks. - Yeah, thanks. - Will Rickman. - Alex Canis. - Pleased to meet you. - Yeah. Say, you wouldn't like to go get a cup of coffee, would you? - Sure. - I know this is a mundane question, but what do you do? - Nothing at the moment. - Oh. Well, what kind of work are you out of? - Demolitions. - Oh. As in explosives, isn't that kind of dangerous? - You know, I'm not really in the mood to talk about work. - You're not very good at this, are you? - Having coffee? - Oh, small talk, flirtation, seduction. - I'm not seducing anybody. - Of course you're not. I am. Thank you. (romantic music) - Why do I get the feeling you're trouble? - Don't you like that in a woman? - I should take you home. - You can try. ♪ Breathe in the moment, take in the sizes ♪ ♪ And love around the corner that you hypnotized ♪ ♪ Clinging as you fall ♪ You're going down, down, down ♪ ♪ Not asking any questions, not wearing any rings ♪ ♪ She's just living in the moment ♪ ♪ With a kiss that has a sting ♪ There ain't no doubt about it ♪ ♪ You're going down, down, down ♪ ♪ You can cut it all you want ♪ You're still going down (tires screeching) ♪ Against your better judgment and not against your will ♪ ♪ She's asking for danger but she's in it for the thrill ♪ ♪ Clinging as you fall ♪ You're going down, down, down ♪ ♪ You should sense the danger coming at your door ♪ ♪ You're a hero in the making ♪ Or you're a fool that she's gone for ♪ ♪ There ain't no doubt about it ♪ ♪ You're going down, down, down ♪ ♪ You can fight it all you want ♪ ♪ You're still going down ♪ You can fight it all you want ♪ ♪ You're still going down (panting) (moaning) (moaning) - I fall asleep? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. I'm enjoying myself. (chuckling) You have no tattoos. - I'm not into pain. - Oh really? Maybe you've just never had it properly applied. (chuckling) We'll have to do something about that. - Oh. Hey. - [Alex] Hey. (chuckling) - That hurt. - Yeah? - Yeah. - In what way? - How many ways are there? - Hmm. Three. There's hurts good. And hurts bad. And hurts real bad. - You shouldn't talk with your mouth full. (giggling) Didn't anybody teach you manners? - Nope. Not that they didn't try. (doorbell ringing) - Alex? Hey, Alex, there's... - Mr. Rickman, you okay? - Fine, Jack. - I noticed your mailbox down. - Yeah, I had a rough night. (chuckling) - You take good care. - Yeah, thanks. (sighing) (chuckling) God. (booming) - Do you enjoy your work, Mr. Rickman? - I did. - And you haven't worked since the MacArthur Hotel? - DOT pulled my card. - It's under review, counselor, standard procedure. - Mr. Rickman, do you recognize these photographs? - Yes, it's the people who were in the MacArthur Hotel. - It's the mother and child who were living in the basement of the MacArthur Hotel who were subsequently crushed to death by 500,000 tons of steal and concrete. - I doubt that. - Excuse me, what did you say? - The building was imploded. One would have to assume that death was instantaneous. - Oh, that makes it okay. - There was a permit. I came in and did a job. - Yes, we've seen. And, personally, you don't care? Do you care, Mr. Rickman? Or doesn't it matter as long as things blow up and you have a permit? (scoffing) Mr. Rickman, judging from your career choices, not to mention your recreational activities, motorcycle racing, skydiving-- - Those are crimes? - Ever try golf? - Yeah, it's boring. - Really? I wonder if the golfers on our jury will think so. - Well, if that's your case, counselor, we'll be sure to exclude them at selection. - Better try to exclude parents, orphans, widows. - Objection. - Mr. Rickman, isn't it true that you have no regard for human life? - You mean like if a plane full of lawyers crashed, would I be upset? No. No, I would not. - I'm not through with the questioning. Let the record show that counsel was not complete with questioning, please. - Talk to me, Will. Okay. You listen then. You know that crack you made about the golfers? That was his way of saying your client is gonna bury himself. Will, boy, you make a lousy witness. Why do you do that? - I like tobacco. It's a safety check so you don't light up with one hand while the other's holding something that can go off. - Well, you know, for someone who's so damn careful, you were pretty reckless back there. - Come on, he was twisting my words. - That's his job. Now, I gave him plenty of room because that is exactly what's gonna come up at your criminal trial. You must understand, these deaths were politically incorrect. And the city is hot to trot to convict somebody. Now, I know you think what happened is on trial here, but it's not, you are. And one picture of you that can be easily drawn is that you're someone with a death wish. Will, look now, we gotta show 'em another side. You got to talk about your parents. - Let's leave them out of this. - You don't care about the house they left you? - What's that got to do with anything? - Well, the circuit court just left to lean on it. The MacArthur development went belly up, chapter 11. You may be their best chance at collecting. - I'll burn it down. - Oh goddammit, I don't wanna hear that kinda talk. Now look, I may be able to get the judgment set aside so you can sell it and pay for your legal fees, living expenses, and whatnot. - I'm not selling that house, I didn't do anything wrong. - Oh, you think that gives you some kind of protective coating like Teflon? Now, Will, your choice of sports aside, most people don't know anyone that volunteers for Beirut, let alone clears mines. - That goes against me, that I was in the service? - Well, that depends, were you serving your country or were you just getting off? Now look, Will, we both know you didn't do anything wrong. That doesn't change the fact that innocent people are dead. Someone was negligent. This is a list... Well, it's a psychiatrist. - Shrinks? - Yeah. - I appreciate that. - Will, you got to talk to somebody. - Is that a professional opinion? - Professional opinion? Hey, hey, you know what my professional opinion is? You're someone with a severe attitude problem, and if you don't change it, a jury's gonna change it. (somber music) - I know it was the first time after so many years, but it's more than that. For the first time, I felt so protected. It's just overwhelming. But then I left and I got so scared because I did something, you know, that I never do, I gave him my address, I showed him where I live. I-- - Trusted him. - Well, I... I ran a check on him before I got home. But you know what happened? When I got home, I wasn't blocked anymore, and I wrote and I wrote and I finished. What do you think? - A life story is not an aesthetic. It's a tool to enable you to look at the events of your life so you can accept them. - Please, come on. - You could always publish. Several patients have. - You know I can't do that. Look. Do you see this? I have one contact on the inside. If this thing goes off, I'll be lucky if I have five minutes to get out with the clothes on my back. Do you think I like living like this? How long have I been seeing you? - How long does it seem? - Like for-fucking-ever. I still don't know if you believe any of this ever happened. - Does that matter? - Yes, dammit, that matters. - Why? - Because, I've never been able to tell anyone, that's why. You know, I just, I thought that if I could just go back and tell somebody the whole story that they would... They'd understand. - Why is that important? - Because then they'd see. You know, they'd see that one thing can lead to another and-- - What else? - Things and that I'd, I didn't start out this way. And I didn't wanna become a-- - [Psychiatrist] A what? - A fucking whore, that's what. (sobbing) (panting) - There's your review, you could never do that before. - I'm shaking, I can't stop shaking. - Don't try. - Mr. Rickman. Mr. Rickman, Mr. Rickman, can I buy your scrap? - What? - From your remodel. I was just at your place and the workers signed for a parcel. - What do you mean workers? - Wasn't it okay to let 'em sign? Hey, Mr. Rickman. (ominous music) (banging) (glass shattering) (phone ringing) - Yeah? Got it. (ominous intense music) - So, what's the deal? - J.B. will be in tonight. - What do we want with this guy? - Maybe use him to bring in the Dove. - I mean, we know where she is. - J.B. doesn't want her damaged yet. - [Man In Suit] So, I'm careful. - [Man In Uniform] Yeah. - What? You think she'd kill herself? - Wouldn't you? - [Man In Suit] There's nothing here. - Yeah, nothing but her fingerprints and his jizz. (laughing) - Yeah, so she screwed the guy, but you know, maybe she felt like it. - No, not her. Not the Dove. (ominous tones) Come on. Get Burns. (gun cocking) (grunting) (silenced gunfire) (grunting) (tense music) (grunting) (screaming) Get him. The south wall. (silenced gunfire) (panting) (tires screeching) (silenced gunfire) Red Bronco coming at you. Contain immediate. Do not allow contact with the Dove. (panting) (pager beeping) - Oh shit. (panting) (phone ringing) (tense music) - [Announcer] $1.25 for the first three minutes please. - [Man] Hello? - Did you page me? - [Man] Mary, is that you, you're still-- - Alive? Surprised? - [Man] I found out late. You've been under surveillance. They matched your prints this morning. - Recon? - [Man] One unit. - ETA. - [Man] They're already in LA. J.B.'s on his way. - Could they be recovery? - [Man] Mar, the whole division is changing with the Eastern Bloc. - Is there a chance? - [Man] No, you're worth more dead than alive. - That's not true. I can't spend it if you're dead. - [Man] You're gonna send me my file, aren't you? Mary, you promised. - I gotta go. - Mar. - Thanks. (tense music) (tires screeching) What are you doing here? - I was on my way to your place. - [Mary] Why? - Some guys were taking my house apart. I got the impression they were friends of yours. - [Mary] They let you go? - I got away. - Don't stop, we're being followed. - It's a garbage truck. - In front, nobody good follows from behind. Pull a U-turn, I'll prove it to you. (tires screeching) - Shit. - Blue wagon, beige van, don't stop at any lights. (gun cocking) - What about cops? - If we don't shake these guys, we may wanna get arrested. - Who are you? - Just someone with a past. It just caught up. (tires squealing) (intense music) (tires squealing) - Motherfuck. (grunting) (thrilling music) (glass shattering) (metallic crashing) (metallic crashing) Now what? Now what? - We wait. - Oh, we wait. What, you got this whole thing figured out? - For the past five years, I've had to live this way. - Five years? - You almost get used to it. You'll need a clear head. - You're a regular boy scout. - Girl scout, and I was a girl scout. - Oh yeah, what are you now? (sighing) - A runaway whose family wants her back. - Hey. Hey. I got some questions. I'm gonna need some real good answers. - Okay. Okay. - Hey. Hey, baby. - [Stephen] Yeah. - Hey. - Will, where the hell are you? No no no no, don't tell me, I don't wanna know. - Well, why do you say that? What's going on? - I had a visit from some very interesting people looking for you. Now what in the hell have you got yourself into? I can't protect you from these type of guys. I'm scared, Will. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if my phone wasn't already tapped. - Oh Jesus Christ. What's going on? - Will? Will. - You shouldn't be drinking. - I need a clear head. My government just tore my house apart, that right? - The dirty work is usually done by subcontractors. But the NSA picks up the bills. National Security Agency? - Yeah, right. What was it you did for 'em? - I was practical, remember? - Oh yeah, how you sold your body. - I served my country. - Yeah, on your back. - No, on my knees. And later on, standing up. You'd be surprised how many powerful men secretly like to be dominated. Any more questions? - Yeah, one. Why'd you go home with me? - I... I didn't wanna be alone. I wanted to be with you. There was something very personal to me in that bag and I couldn't believe it when you helped me get it back. (sighing) I am really, really sorry about all this but not about that night. (sighing) I'm gonna take a shower. - [Will] Excuse me. - You wanna come in? - I just need a towel. Now let me get this straight, the people you're working for are trying to kill you, huh? - [Mary] Was working for. Leaving is against the rules. They're a covert sector of the NSA using their status for illegal activities, but I know too much, and one of them just won't let go. - J.B. The people in my house, they were talking about him like he was their boss. - Oh, he is. You wanna know J.B.? That's J.B. He loved to test me. One time, when my loyalty was in question, he needed to be convinced. That's when I left. - That's not so hard to believe. You got a light? - In my backpack. (piano music) (spitting) You see what an effect information can have? It's out there on all of us. - What are you doing with this? - Like I said, I was scared. I had to make sure you weren't one of them. I still have connections. - Yeah, I see. (sighing) - The clippings of your court case I got from the library. You had to get security clearance to go to Lebanon. The rest was in your military file. I had to check you out. Try and look at it from my point of view. - I don't give a goddamn about your point of view. - It's contagious, isn't it? Paranoia, conspiracy. It's not my world, it's theirs. - I don't want either one. - You have no choice. - There's always a choice. - Oh really, did you have a choice when the hotel owner hid the squatter problem? Or when your family went head on to a drunk driver when they were picking you up from summer camp. How much choice did you have in being an orphan? - What, shit happens. There's a still a choice, what you do about it. - Oh really? And what did you do about it, huh? - Well I didn't fucking sell myself. - Fuck you. (shouting) What do you want me to do about it, huh, say I'm sorry? I'm not fucking sorry. You want me to be sorry about that night? Huh? It was so damn good. (moaning) The fifth floor, west end, facing the street. Right there. - You're gonna break in there to steal a copy of a book you're never gonna publish? - It could put somebody in jeopardy, someone who's helped me a lot. You don't have to do this. - I know. (bell dinging) (tense music) - You wait here and watch the elevator. (tense music) What's the matter? - It's taking too long, let's go. - Just a minute, I gotta... (sighing) - Oh Jesus Christ. - That's J.B.'s signature. Come on, let's go. Come on, we've got to go. (tense music) J.B. - You should see the look on your face. - Run! (intense music) (gun cocking) (gunfire) Goddammit, Mary! Mary, goddammit! Oh shit. All right, Mary. I'm hit. You goddamn shot me. It's okay if you wanna come finish me off, now would be the time to do it. Because if you don't, Mary, if you don't come up here I'm gonna come down there, because we gotta talk. (gunshot) Stop that! What is this all about? Is this about the book? I read the book, okay? I mean, you haven't done anything to be ashamed of. Really, it's my responsibility. I was the team leader. I mean, if I would've been doing my job, I would've seen what was happening to you and I would've understood and I would've been able to help you. And I didn't, and I'm sorry. It's my responsibility, it's still my responsibility, for Christ's sake. I'm the one who recruited you, remember? You know? I mean, I found you. And we were a team, we were a goddamn good team and we can be a team again. - No. (gunshot) - We can be a team again because we did some goddamn good work together for some goddamn good reasons. I know you remember that. I mean, you ever think about that? I mean, do you miss it? I miss it. Goddamn, I miss it. So look (chuckling) I still love you. And you know that, don't you? I've always loved you, I'm always gonna love you, there's nothing you could do to make me stop loving you. And really, and I hope you don't resent my bringing this to your attention, but I'm the only one who can love you. (thrilling music) (grunting) - Oh goddammit, come on. (intense music) (gunfire) Here you go. - Jesus, it itches. - That's just lice, come on. - Hey. Hey. You want my shoes too? Huh? (banging) - Stop. Pull over. This is it. Hey, thanks. - My pleasure, be safe. - We got a ways to go. - How much farther? - Oh, about 40 miles. - 40? I ain't walking 40 miles. (laughing) Of course you're not, I've got a car, come on. Okay. - [Will] I thought we were going to the mountains. - [Mary] There's something I wanna show you first. - [Will] Beautiful boat. - Oh, it's more than that. The registry can't be traced to me and nobody knows about it. - You act like all this is normal. Guess that works in your world. - Yeah, it does. I mean, what works in your world, huh? How well do you sleep at night? Why did you help me that night? What made you cross that line? - When my family died, I thought it was the lowest point in my life. Then came the MacArthur Hotel. I did my own safety checks, I mean aside from the other ones and I heard a sound and I shined a light and I saw a rat. Only now I know what it really was. When they pulled my card, it was a relief. I don't ever wanna push the button again. I guess that's not an answer to your question. - Yes it is. We'll be safe here. Here. Go on in. - I need some sleep. - I know. (peaceful music) (dramatic music) (chuckling) I... I used to wonder about people who ended up in terrible ways. How they came to cross that line. But it's a series of lines, you know? That keep getting moved back until eventually you're lost. - Why did you want me to read this? - Because I wanted you to know that I didn't start out this way. (sighing) When I finally figured out that the government was paying me shit money for my expertise, I began to demand extraordinary gifts from the people I entertained. But things just kept getting worse, and so I ran. - What do you want from me? - I have a plan to get away for good. - Well, you seem to have it all worked out. - I thought I had but I couldn't leave till I finished that and then when I did I didn't wanna go alone. - You telling me you want company? - Well, what are you gonna do? You can't stay. Your fingerprints are all over my shrink's office. - I don't know. I don't know that I care. - Oh come on, you don't have a death wish. You have a life wish like me. - A life wish? - Yeah. (glass shattering) You always smoke when you don't know what to feel. You don't deal with your anger very well either, do you? Maybe that's why you've been blowing things up all your life. Come on, would it be so bad? Us getting away together? Huh? Goddammit, will you say something? What is wrong? Is it my past, hm, is that what it is? Is it too much for you? Are you disgusted? Is that what it is? Do you want what they had, huh, is that it? You want what they had? - No. - What then? - Sh. Sh. (sobbing) I want this. (moaning) (dramatic music) (moaning) (yawning) (revelatory tones) (piano music) (dramatic music) (sighing) - [Stephen] Why would she kill her doctor? - [Will] I don't know, to shut her up, I don't know, but she signed it just like the one in her freezer. - [Stephen] Yeah, but why? - It's all part of some plan she's got to disappear. The woman, the one in the freezer, the one whose teeth she changed to match her dental records? She just had the bad luck of looking like her. Mine was sleeping with her. I don't know what's going on. I know I just want out. I just want out. - You forgot to count. - Huh? - Your fingers. Hey, hey, Will, look I know you're upset, but let's just look at the facts. If you didn't have anything to do with the shrink's death, forensics will bear you out. I went by your house the other day. There's evidence there. There's evidence here. - What are you saying? - You know what I'm saying. You gotta turn yourself in. - No, no way. - No, Will, Will, now listen to me, I know you've had a bad couple of years, and we both know that justice is neither swift nor blind, but you're getting in real deep here. - It won't work. - The bottom line is that you haven't done anything wrong. Have you? - That didn't help with the MacArthur Hotel. - Oh shit. I don't know what to say. I mean, what else can I do? What do you want from me? - Cash. - Cash? You got cash here. - There's only a couple of thousand there. It could be marked, I can't touch that. Look, man, I got nothing. I got no credit cards, no ID, nothing. - You're putting me in an extremely awkward position. - Look, there's gotta be a million jewels there. Get me 30, 40 grand, take the rest. - I don't want the rest. It's Sunday, the banks are closed. (somber music) All right, I... I might have to make a couple of calls. (sighing) Come on in the back, you look like you could use something to eat. - Oh thank you, thank you. - Not much of an appetite, huh? Oh, Francis, could you run upstairs and give my wife a hand, please, ma'am? - Why'd you do that? - Oh, I just thought we oughta be alone. - The door, you just unlocked the door. - No, I didn't. No no, I just checked it. - No, you didn't. - Will, look this whole thing's making you a little nuts. (tense music) I tried to tell you, I tried to. You've put me in a real awkward position here, I... - [J.B.] Rickman, this is an old watch here. - Yeah, it was my father's. - Yeah? All right. Let's do this one more time. You say she has a cabin in the mountains here. - Yes. - And she's there now. - I told you she's dead by now. - You're sure about that? Mary Ann Curran, designation Dove, known to you as Alex Canis. Are you sure she's dead, Rickman? - I trip wired her cabin. It'll blow 10 seconds after the front door opens. - But you don't actually know for a fact she's dead, do you? - [Will] No. - You just hope she is, don't you? - Yes. - I mean, you really want her dead. - Yes. - God, Rickman, she's really something, isn't she? Isn't she something? I mean, she's just got this way about her, doesn't she? She can really get under your skin. Rickman? You wouldn't lie to me, would you? - Sure I would. - That's a good answer. - J.B., take a look at this. Definitely the ones I traced. - How much? - 200K. - What's the total? - About a million eight. - That's not even half of it. Even if she only got 30 cents on the dollar at the cleaner. I want a chemical interrogation. - We don't have time, J.B. We need him sharp to navigate. I'm satisfied with the results. - You are? - Yes, I am. - I'm not. Now, according to our friend in there, she could already be dead. - You know the Dove, she's always got a back door. - We need to move now before she takes flight. - Not yet. Not until I'm ready. This is the part where the spy offers the victim a cigarette. Dammit, I didn't mean to do that. (spitting) Rickman, in the old days there used to be an operative whose signature was to take a lit cigarette just like this and press it against a man's eyeball with just enough pressure so that without even bending the cigarette, he could sort of plop and poke it the whole way through. In the old days. Now here's the bottom line, Rickman, I don't say this to many people. I'm gonna say it to you. If we had more time, I mean I don't know, maybe a couple of days, we could be friends you and me. I mean, I really think we could be friends, and I'd like that. Would you? But I don't have more time. Goddammit, Rickman, I don't have any more time. You won't believe the pressure I'm under here. I mean, that's my problem. Now it's your problem. (tense music) Well, Rickman, our machine tells us you were telling the truth about where the Dove is. But you're telling a lie about whether or not you want her dead. Now, it's possible that you're just having mixed emotions. It's also possible, and this is what troubles me, it's possible you're simply lying about everything. And since I don't have time to conduct a thorough interrogation, I'm gonna have to take some shortcuts. - What do you want? - I want the truth, Rickman, about the location of the Dove. - I told you. - Yes you did, didn't you? - What do you want from me? - Rickman, I want you to convince me. (screaming) (television white noise) - I think I finally got you, J.B., try and pick this out. Damn. - You were wrong about the doctor. The Cat's Cradle is actually my signature. Ortiz, break his finger. (bone cracking) (screaming) All right now, Rickman, next is your arm, then your leg. You understand? So you behave yourself. Get in the van. (ominous music) So it's the first left after the county line, is that right? Is that right? - Yeah. - That must be Santa Rosa Creek Road. It'll be coming right up. - [J.B.] All right, cut the lights. All right, stop here, stop here. - [Burns] Did you see that, J.B.? (horn honking) - That's her. - [Will] You're not gonna stop her? - Come on come on come on, what's the delay? - He said 10 seconds. Nine. Eight. - Alex! (explosion booming) - Let's move. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) Let's go. Move. - Come down here. J.B. (dramatic music) - [Mary] Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You're hurt. - Come on. (panting) You got it. - Shit. - Do you want me to do it? - No. (explosion booming) (panting) - Come on. (pleasant tones) - [Will] You know, I was thinking about leaving it all behind, but actually doing it. God, you're beautiful. You are beautiful. I wanna know everything about you. Everything, everything you love, food, music, anything. What's your favorite color? (giggling) - [Mary] Blue, what's yours? - [Will] Blue. - [Mary] There, you see? I knew we had something in common. (laughing) (romantic music)
