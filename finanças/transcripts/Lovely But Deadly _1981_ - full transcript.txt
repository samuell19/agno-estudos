And she's something else. What does she want? Well she said, and I quote, some decent action, and some great you know what. Girls, I gotta take care of something. We'll be back. You know Larry, I do you some pretty big favors don't I? I mean a guy like me who helps you out would be a pretty valuable business associate, don't you think? That's what I think, you got to give to get, you gotta get to give, right? - Take a walk. - Like I'm taking. Oh Larry, this is, this is... Mary Ann Lovitt. - Lovitt. - But you can call me Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Would you like to go on a tour with Captain Magic? If you can provide the tickets. I got it all baby. Just come with me. Welcome to Captain Magic's castle. Not bad. One of the fringe benefits of my business is that I got plenty of cash to fix the place up like this. Does your mother know you have this setup here? Maxxie baby the lush, is usually so drunk, that she doesn't know if she has a son. Now it's time for Captain Magic to show you how he got his name! You don't give a girl much room to maneuver do you? Well... Captain Magic likes his women with a lot, a lot of action. Well then Captain Magic has the right girl. Oh yeah that's good... Um, I thought I told that, that little Cricket guy, to set you straight? Huh? I didn't come here just to roll around. - Do you know what I mean? - Oh... Okay we'll do a little toot. You got any rocket fuel? - Elephant? - No, gasoline for my car. What's in it for me. All the action you can handle. Can't believe this is really happening again. A wild, sexy and gorgeous junky! Whoo! Captain Magic's lucky day! Yeah well, you take your ordinary garden variety parsley, you soak it overnight, some liquid angel, and presto! You sell that stuff to all the kids? To whoever pays. That's neat. Are you the only pusher in school? No, there's other kids. I take care of the younger kids. I specialize in junior highs. That's what I thought. You want a hit. No, but you do! Ya! Oh, can I give you a hand? Hey that wasn't funny. You wanted a woman of action! Oh I changed my mind I just want a sweet young thing that's afraid of me! Oh! How would Captain Magic like a taste of his own medicine? No, wait, no I, I... Back home, I used to rub the throat of an old opossum, just like this, so he would take his medicine. Hello? Police? Hey thanks. I'll see you at cheerleading practice. All right Claire I'll see you there. Hi Barb! Boy do I have news for you guys! - Oh yeah? - Sh! It's about Larry Burgess. This is the High School Library, - not a gymnasium! - Captain Magic? - I can't stand him! - Don't, he's dead! What? Hey, what are you all worked up about? You didn't even know the guy. How, but you told me he was, the guy that sold the drugs to my little brother, so I keep thinking about it that's all. Hey I'm sorry I forgot. So what happened to Larry? Well when the cops found him, they had to cart him off to the hospital! But how did he die? Did he OD? He hung himself in the hospital! Why? Bust I guess. When the cops searched his room in the attic, they found everything, PCP, cocaine, the new stuff, everything. Oh that's heavy! - See ya later. - Bye. Bye! ♪ Can we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ When ♪ ♪ Then we make it, in the morning ♪ ♪ The way we made it fast last night ♪ ♪ And we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ Gotta feeling ♪ ♪ And we'll make it in the morning ♪ ♪ And let me love away the day ♪ Salad and milk please. Thank you. Are you Mary Ann Lovitt? Yes sir. Police Detective Jack Domley. I've been told you were seen at the school dance with the late Larry Burgess. - Larry Burgess? - Yeah, uh-huh. I might have met him. I don't remember. Well according to a kid called Cricket, thinks you left the dance with Burgess. A girl tipped off the police about Burgess. You wouldn't be that girl now would you? The police? Me, no I don't think so. Come on Domley give her a break! Hey Cricket's a garbage head, you know that. Somebody said he introduced her to Burgess. So she happened to meet the wrong people. She's new in the school, she doesn't know any better. Next time, you owe me one. Thanks. We go better find a table. Okay. The police think they can solve everything just by asking questions, right? So, you're Mary Ann Lovitt. Lovely. What's Lovely? My name. Lovely's my nickname. I like it better than Lovitt anyway. It's not a very lucky name around here. How come? Oh there was a kid in school named Arthur Lovitt. He drowned, strung out on drugs. I know. He was my kid brother, Arthur. Hey I'm sorry. It's the stupid drug situation. I hate it too! Trouble is, dealers have gotten so powerful. Like Larry Burgess. No, the people behind him. I think that's how he got killed. Didn't he commit suicide? They found him strangled, hanging by a necktie. They thought it was his. But was it? Ever seen a kid at Pacific Coast High wearing a tie? I guess not. I better go to class. Maybe we can get together sometime. Well, I'm kind of seeing someone. Well how 'bout just a talk? Why don't you come over to my Aunt May's house, tomorrow, I'm staying there. Great. I tell you what, I'll come by later and get the directions okay? Okay. Lovely dear I wish you wouldn't do that with the hatchet! How else am I gonna chop wood? Well let me hire one of those gardener persons to do it. Don't be silly. One winter in Idaho, and you can chop browns real easy! Watch this! Hi! Hi! I thought I heard some voices so I came around the back! Aunt May, this is Steve Berringer. - How do you do? - Hello Steve. Good heavens! Anything wrong out here May? No. Stop making such a big deal! And this is my father, Chet Lovitt. Uh Steve, I'm so glad that you stopped in, I've been begging Lovely to have some of her friends over from school. Well I just came over to talk. Well I bet you children would like some cookies and milk, hmm? - Steve? - No, no thank you, that's nice of you though. Well if you change your minds let me know. I'd better run, see if everybody's ready. You going somewhere? I'm taking my parents to the airport. They've been here since the funeral. Hope my dad didn't get to you. He looked like he wanted to deck me. It's just that he's so angry about what happened to my brother. He just wants to tear into somebody, probably would have, if you hadn't been injured. What happened to him? Oh, a logging accident, back home in Idaho. Well, I don't blame him for being angry. That's why my mom sent Arthur here, to stay with my Aunt May. She didn't want the same thing to happen to him, you know becoming a logger and then, being tossed aside. Hey, let me take them to the airport. I'd like that. Mom? This is Steve Berringer from my school. How do you do Mrs. Lovitt? Arthur... No Mom, it's Steve Berringer from my school. He's gonna take you and Dad to the airport. I'll wait for you in the car. Parking lot A is for country club members only. Visitors please use parking lot B. Parking lot A is for country... So Frank, strictly off the record of course, what do you think about this drug problem in the schools, it's a national epidemic. And a socially acceptable one. It's a farce! I don't see any difference between drugs and alcohol! Neither one is any good for you. Let's just be grateful that drugs are still illegal. Jav! There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere! Aunt May said you were gonna meet me at the tennis court! Your Aunt May gets her signals crossed. Lovely this is Franklin Van Dyke, he's the Superintendent of the Pacific Coast School System, and he's an old family friend. - Hi. - A pleasure. So you're a school official. No wonder you got such good grades. Uh this kid couldn't get away with favoritism even if he wanted to! His father was a very disciplined man. And he insisted that his son follow his example. I'm sure his dad would be very proud of him. Especially since he took over the shipping line. Look let's just drop this all right. Well I better be running off anyway, vandalism at the school, very depressing. Seems like I'm the one who has to handle it. Well very nice meeting you Lovely. Goodbye Mr. Van Dyke. I, and uh give me a ring at the school and we'll pick up where we left off. - Bye bye! - I'm sorry I upset you about your dad. Nah that's all right. I guess I put it all behind me now anyway. - Than what is it? - The work, the responsibility. Try running a shipping line while you're in college. When all I really want to do is my music. I know, and you will! Hey, I've got some great news for you! - What? - Well they're letting me promote my music at your school! - No kidding? - Yeah! Think you can drum me up some support from the kids, - it'd be a big help? - You got it! ♪ So I'm patient ♪ ♪ I gotta know, oh ♪ ♪ Wake me up in the morning ♪ ♪ The fast the night ♪ ♪ When we make it, in the morning ♪ ♪ The way we made it fast last night ♪ ♪ Can we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ While the feeling ♪ ♪ Can we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ And just love away the day ♪ ♪ When we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ The ♪ ♪ Can we make it, in the morning ♪ ♪ The way we made it fast last night ♪ ♪ Can we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ Got a feeling ♪ ♪ When we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ And just love away the day ♪ ♪ When we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ The last ♪ ♪ When we make it, in the morning ♪ ♪ The way we made it fast last night ♪ ♪ When we make it in the morning ♪ ♪ I'm feeling ♪ ♪ When we make it, in the morning ♪ ♪ And just love away the day ♪ Is that it up there? Which one? The last one in the section. You don't want to tangle with me, believe me! Oh yeah I'd love to tangle with you! You're in the wrong section! What you want, is in fiction! What's going on here? Oh nothing, I was just looking for a book that's all! Well, you know, you're not looking close enough! Hey I'm gonna lose my job! Kid is a real space cadet. If you hadn't come along I would have decked him one. Sure. Just glad to help you out. If you're the Student Council President, why don't you crack down on that darn drug situation? Especially the heavy ones! I'm doing everything I can. It's not good enough. We've got to do something! I agree, I think you're right. I gotta talk to you. I got nothing to talk to you about, take off! Awaiting for your answer. Tell them I'm not interested in the offer. You're making a big mistake. Who was that? That was an honor student. One of our many burnouts. So? He said no. What? He said no. What was the offer that, that burnout kid was talking about? Some spending money, in return for closing my eyes for the drug situation. Then you did the right thing. I hope so. Mantis Managian, one of the biggest dealers in school, has got girlfriends exchanging sexual favors for some good highs. Have you ever done drugs? I sure did. And believe me, I got the scars to prove it. Uh-oh that looks like trouble, come on. There's a door back there, come on! Take that side! Dammit, it's locked! We're trapped! Hey, I didn't know you could fight like that! So, you're always around when there's trouble, Mary Ann Lovitt. - So are you. - Yeah but I'm trying to do something about it. I want to help! Other kids can help too. That's just what I need, a bunch of teenage vigilantes hanging around my tail! - I'm serious! - So am I! Now you let me take care of this my way! Just answer my questions like a good girl. Let me give you some real information then. - Any time. - Just before he was attacked, Steve told me the name of, of the biggest dealer in school, a guy named Mantis Managian. I'm glad to see that you take your job so seriously. Yeah I brought Mantis Managian in. Lot of good it did you! He's a football star! He was out of jail before the chair he was sitting on got warm. What did you do, forget to read him his rights? No somebody forgot to read me my rights, thou shalt not touch the football team! It's a new commandment! School board would rather see these kids walking zombies than lose a game to Oceanview High. Two kids are dead, a boy has just been attacked, and he might die, and you're not going to do anything about it? Look there's nothing to be done that we aren't already doing! That's just not enough! Okay now with your partner! You know what you gotta do, do it! Hai! Hiya! No, now ladies, you have to be more fluid. Now watch me quickly. Hai! Now go to it! - I'm sorry I'm late. - That's okay. Let's warm up. Suzie I need a favor. Yeah what? I want to meet Mantis Managian. No you don't. I have to. Look he's one of the biggest dealers in school, leave him alone. It's not a social thing. I think he might know something about what happened to Steve. Look, Steve is my friend too. And I'm sorry about your brother. But I don't want to get involved with the drug scene. I see. You figure, if you just ignore the situation, it'll go away, okay. That's not it. Come on! Come on! Look, look we're friends, and I'm sorry, but I can't afford to get involved, I'm on the faculty. It's too bad. 'Cause if more people like you did get involved, and had the guts to say what they think, Arthur might not have died. I think you're stretching the point a little. Aren't you? Aren't you? Am I? Hi Tina. Hi! I need to talk to you. Why? I hear that you used to go out with Mantis Managian. Yeah, until Gloria snaked him away. Do you still know him well enough to introduce me to him? What for? I hear he has some really good stuff. How do you know what you'll be getting into? Sure. Men. It isn't just blowing a little weed, or making out in the parking lot. Well that's boring anyway. You gotta like doing it, with the guys. Which for men. I think Mantis is really gonna like you. In fact, I hope he likes you a whole lot! Oh why is that Tina? Oh hi Gloria. I like your hair! I thought I told you, nobody gets to Mantis, unless it's through me! I was gonna talk to you about it Gloria, really, honest! Ow! You tell our friend here, that she has to stay in line before she gets in line - to meet Mantis! - Okay Gloria, okay! - I jammed my fingers. - I don't care get her! Come on! All right knock it off! Ladies, I said, knock it off! Ladies, knock it off! Looks like your authority's wearing a little thin, huh coach? Next time I'll take a few of your teeth with it! If I ever, catch any of you, fighting again, she's off the squad! Understood! I'm not through with you yet! Set, hut one, hut two! Get up! Let's go right over here! Mantis, you're late, better get out there! Listen Cricket, nobody tells Mantis Managian what to do, you got that? Hey, it wasn't my idea, the coach says I should'a tell you. Will you tell the coach something? You tell him that I'm gonna take a little time out, till he comes over to apologize. - Right away. - And uh, tell him he better get here quick, or the next time I'm in his biology class, I'm gonna dissect him, instead of those frogs. You got it Mantis. Hey Lovely left the crew. - I know. - Well hello. Get back in line. I'm Mantis Managian. You one of the new cheerleaders? If they don't drop me. Would you be interested in a little extra-curricular activity? I might. There's gonna be a real neat party this week. Oh yeah? A nice looking girl could get whatever she wants there. Know what I mean? Okay, shout! high! Fast and tight too high too famous! That's right, so fast, get out of our way! You better step out, this just ain't your day! Jennifer, why don't you come down and dust my rocks off? Cricket, doorbell's ringing, get it. Doorbell... - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Lovely. - Yes you certainly are. Thanks, that's my nickname. How'd you know about the party? I don't think I've, had you here before. - Mantis invited me. - Ah yes the new cheerleader! That's me! Well you're in for a treat, let me show you around the place. This is incredible. It is isn't it? It's amazing what money can buy. It really is. This is an antique Steinway, incredible sound. Cost me 10,000 when I bought it, now it's worth, 60 maybe 70,000. - No kidding? - Yeah. I only had to pay 1500 down! It's like having a license to steal. Jeez. Hey Lovely! Hi! How do you like my find Warren? Very much, in fact uh, well enough to add her to my collection. Not just yet my man, you know I like to test the merchandise before I pass it around. What an ego. How'd you like a tour of the house? Is this Warren's bedroom? There, that gave us a chance to release some of that crazy energy. Pardon? All those pent up lusts we've been feeling for each other. - We met the other day. - Oh those. Mine have been really pent up. I know, but I'll take care of that. Yeah you're gonna have a real good time here on the Pacific Coast. I hope so anyway. Listen kid, I hate to dissapoiont you but uh, I was just back here with Gloria fooling around so, you're gonna have to wait a little while for me. Hope you can stand it. We'll just have to wait. We'll just have to. I hope you're not too disappointed. - It's okay. - I didn't have the heart to keep you in suspense any longer. Must feel a lot better, knowing that your turn is coming up soon. I can hardly wait. Let's go. Hey, it's Bernie O'Rourke, isn't it? That's right, Mr. Gilmarten. Well boy, I hear you're a tackler, getting a bit sloppy. - Better watch it. - Yes sir I will. I can do a lot for your advance, as long as you hold up your end. Yes sir Mr. Gilmarten. Mr. Gilmarten, uh, Mantis wants me to let him know as soon as you arrive, so as soon as you arrive let me know. Oh, wait right here. Hey boy, hey boy. Now look I don't wait for nobody. You just tell Mantis to come along and find me. You hear? Sorry, you can't come in without a costume. You're a clown Gommorah! Come on! You know you're supposed to be outside helping Bernie keep guard. I just want to go in and get a girl. I'm pretty sure if Mr. Gilmarten sees one he thinks you'll like, he'll bring her out here to you. I want to pick me own! You know what you're supposed to do. Do what you're told! I'll uh, introduce you to all the right people. Well I ain't lying, like that. Mr. Gilmarten. Lovely, this is Mr. Gilmarten. - Well howdy. - He owns Honest Charley's. I don't know what that is. She's from out of town Mr. Gilmarten. Well now, Honest Charley's is the fastest growing chain of bargain retail stores in the country. No kidding! I built her up from nothing. I can see how you'd do really well, everybody likes a good honest bargain. Well now, you just stay on my good side and I'll give you a free introductory gift, no additional cost or obligation, huh? Mr. Gilmarten, I'd love it if you'd help me fix my zipper, it's stuck and I can't seem to get the costume off or on. Aww. Excuse me. Now let me see here... I'd really like to get the zipper fixed. So I can get it off. Well honey it'd be a real shame now, if you couldn't get it off. There you go. You rotten little weasels! This is an 18th century marble floor! Why is it covered with creamed herring? It never looked better! Ask her! I didn't do anything, I was right here. I don't like this, it's wasteful. Go clean yourself up. And you, cool it. - It's all weighed and marked. - Good that was quick. Gloria, she's been getting out of hand lately. Straighten her out. This new synthetic stuff is selling like hot cakes. I know, we're gonna make a fortune with it. You I could, I'll finally be able to pay my Porsche off. Mantis, if this continues you'll be able to buy a Rolls. God! Oh! - You sat in the caviar! - How rude! You! Look, I already gave you a warning. What did I do? I was just standing here! Hey, be careful with that statue! It's pre-Columbian and it's very expensive, watch it! - I'll call Gloria off... - No! Let 'em be. Watch it, watch! Oh no! Wha-Watch it! My China, no! You have no class! No, no, not the chopped liver! God damn I got to tell you, female mud wrestling was never this good. No way. All right everybody that's it! Party's over, go home, now! Come on, out! Oh, now now... - Out! - Now come on Warren let the gals finish their fight, come on! I like this one. You bring her around tomorrow, you hear? Right. Goodnight Warren.

I have no idea where she's gone! I swear it's so difficult to keep track of these days. - Okay, bye. - Bye. This man's a trafficker for us. Hmm? - I didn't know that. - Warren Lang. Don't. Here she is Mr. Gilmarten. - Howdy. - I promise you'll enjoy this, lovely afternoon. You like the ocean? I used to. Drinking, is one of my vices. I'm much more interested in one of your other vices. Well, which vice is that? If you rub, two brain cells together, then you figure it out. I wish you wouldn't feel as though you have to act this way. Lovely's uh, not your real name is it? Mary Ann. But I hate it. I like it, there's an innocence about it. That's why I hate it. I don't understand that about you young gals. You all deny your innocence. You all think I'm looking for sex, but, I'm not. Then what are you looking for, drugs? Now please now don't you go and get flippant with me you hear? Just start open up for ya! I'm sorry. I just thought that a big businessman like you would want me to act this way. You know, cool and together. That's not it at all. All I'm looking for is love. Like you teenagers have in the back of cars. Not quite sure I follow. Well I don't want you to think you have to go farther with me than you would with any other boy, eh? Ok. There now, that was pretty nice, wasn't it. After I while, I may try to touch you. But you don't have to let me unless you really want to. And of course we'll, maybe, along way, unless you really love me. Sorry Mary Ann, I guess I went too far huh? I can't help it if you didn't get any in high school. Oh now look now I promise I'll be more gentle the next time. You're giving me the creeps! I don't understand! Well maybe this will make it clear for you. Ya! All I wanted was love! Ah, love? How about head over heels? How 'bout a little candy! That's Mantis's mark! Ah, funny you should notice. You want more is that it? What I want you can never give me. Big shipment coming in tomorrow you can have all you want! What shipment, where? Why, what do you want? Oh! What kept you boys? Marko was helping me with my shell collection! That's Mantis's mark. - Did she send it? - Well he delivered her. Now the point is did he plan to take over on his own, or did somebody else put him up to it? I don't like Warren Lang, he won't let me into his parties. Maybe that's because he don't like your table manners! Huh? Well, Warren Lang is loyal, you get him on the phone for me. You hear right now, you get him on that phone! Yes sir Mr. Gilmarten. Hey Mantis how come you walking, you're gonna be late! I didn't have much choice! Some jerk stole the tires off my car. Better climb aboard! Hey what is this? Well, I didn't have any choice, I mean they were gonna pull my teeth out with pliers! Hey, hey! What's going on? Guess pretty boy. Easy, easy! Now you okay Gommorah? - Okay. - Okay. Oh, I hit my head! Gommorah, you can do the honors. I don't like mechanical things. Oh god! God! I bumped my head it really hurts!

Look, I'll just, give me a couple of minutes to change. Make it quick. I'm looking for a girl, her name's Lovely, and she's five foot six, - brown hair, brown eyes? - No I'm sorry. - I'll follow you. - Okay. Why don't you untie her. He has nothing to do with this. Let him go! What are you doing here? If you wanted to see my shipyard all you had to do was ask. They brought me here. She's just a friend, she doesn't know what she's doing. Oh uh, I think she does. Question is uh, do you know what she's doing? Now come on, you just be honest with good old Charley, ya hear? I haven't seen her for days. Well now you've been uh, going steady with her now for the last, two, three summers haven't you? - Heh? - Yeah. Come on Javelin, you don't have to answer to these weasels. Oh yes he does, how do you think the drugs get here, by carrier pigeon? Oh no... You're boyfriend, my partner Mary Ann! So I guess that makes him as big a weasel as the rest of us huh? Shut up Gilmarten! You were the one who got Arthur all strung out? I had nothing to do with it! I own ships right? And if my ships weren't used, well then somebody else's would. But you killed my brother! All those times you were saying that you were helping him. How could you do it, how? Hey come off it will ya? You killed Arthur! When I think of all those kids you so messed up! Get the hell off me! Come on. I'm not gonna do this forever you know? I want a singing career! That takes big bucks. Honest Charley here takes care of me, so, I let him use my ships. It's for us! Us? Who do you think I am? Us? Do you think that the whole world revolves around us? Don't you ever think of anyone else? Enough talk, shut her up! Don't you feel anything? You should have minded your own business. Well, I guess she's caught on to us. What do you intend to do about it? I don't know. You want to go to prison? No. I guess that doesn't leave us any choice then. There's only on thing we can do. Agreed? Well did you find her? I just saw something I think you should know about! - Go on. - You know Warren Lang? The commodities broker who we think might be a dealer? - Okay. - I saw him down at the docks with Honest Charley Gilmarten and Javelin Scott, the kid who owns the shipping lines. - Oh yeah. - I think there's a drug connection! I think they've got Lovely down there. - Sure they do. - Hey can't you at least go down there and check it out? You guys are giving me a headache. Well I'm sorry, we thought you might want to do something about this! Hey well what do you want me to do? We can't issue a warrant just because some high school kid thinks he saw something. This is ridiculous. What's wrong with her? Dammit Domley, why don't you ever act on any hot tips? You always show up at the wrong time, the wrong place, and you start hassling the wrong people! Now for once, will you act in time to really help? I guess that's the shipment Gilmarten was talking about huh? Something like that. Get in. What are you guys up to? This crate's being shipped to Taiwan. We thought you might like to go along for the ride. Don't worry, when we pack you in the crate we'll be sure to label it fragile, handle with care. I'd rather you just shoot me! Oh no that would uh, that would be messy. I know you like messes, I don't. - I have a last request. - Who cares. One last thrill before I die? - What do you say? - Okay! No Gommorah. It's out of the question. You can't say that to me. I just did, I'm in charge here! No, you never invite me into your parties, you never let me have any fun. Next party I'll invite you in, okay? It's too late. I don't like you by now. - I won't come. - Whatever. Let's just put her in the crate and get it over with. Oh... After I'm done. Another two minutes won't matter. You ready? I could do a lot more if you untie my hands. No! Oh! Hey! Hey, the girl, is getting away! Come on! , get her, capture her! Don't shoot her, I want her alive! Come on! - Ow! - Come on! You're not blowing! I'll kill her! Hey, stop her! Hey, you can't go down there! What do you think you're doing? Hey, hey! Hey, you guys can't go through it without paying! Come on, come on! That isn't enough! Hey, where do you think you're going? You people have got to stop being so pushy! Pushy? I'll show you what pushy is! I'm gonna call the Harbor Patrol! She's out of gas! Her engine's conked out! We got her! Close in, I'll grab her! Oh... tangle with her! You just did sport! Hey Gommorah! Gommorah! Hey Gommorah! Damn Gommorah where have you been? I found a shortcut! Well let's go! Come on! Gommorah! Shoot her, shoot her, don't let her get away! - Catch her! - I got her, she's mine! Her, not me! Come on driver turn left! Well, there goes your girlfriend. You know Gommorah never was subtle. Neither are you. We best take a look. You go! Once that ship gets in the harbor it's your problem. I better go back to Van Dyke. Hey you boys! Get over here! Get that gal before she gets into trouble, you hear me? Hurry up! Over here you guys! Let's go! Come on, just walk through 'em. Come on girls, let's get 'em! Barb, Karen, corner this guy! Look! She's up there, Mr. Gilmarten! You better get down! Duck, duck your head! Shoot her, shoot her! Oh no, I'm getting out of here! There they are, come on! - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. That's Honest Charlie! He's not so honest. He's the head of the whole drug ring around here. Oh, the stuff's inside the dolls! This is the Harbor Patrol! Everyone stay where you are! This is the Harbor Patrol! Everyone stay where you are! Come on, there are more weasels to catch! What about Charley here? Just leave him to the Harbor Patrol. Hey, we said stay where you are! Stay where you are! Why do they do this, why? Frank, your office said I'd find you here. What was that disgraceful business with Warren Lang at the country club? They got Lovely. She found out about us. She doesn't know about me does she? I didn't do anything, a little money exchanged hands, that's all! It doesn't matter! Gilmarten took care of her. What did he do? They shouldn't kill people should they? They shouldn't, but they do.
