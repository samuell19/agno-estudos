This door? This box or that box? Are they all for me? Cool. Thanks! Hey, where are you going? Hey, what are you doing? Hey, open the door. Hey! What's going on? There is nothing, no name, no face, no nothing. I was born into nothingness, you could say I don't exist. Daddy, look what I can do! Very Good! Hi! Hallo! Could you help me? I lost my goggles? Dad, look. Great. They are down there in the deep water, but I can't dive that deep. Dad, you are not looking. Of course I am. Would you help me? Yeah sure. Lotte, wait here in the shallow water, I'll be right back. So, where are your goggles? Down there. There you go. Thanks! No problem! Would you go on the slide with me. I get scared on my own. No way. Or we could play 'animal jumping', I'll jump into the water and pretend to be an animal and you have to guess what I am. I am here with my daughter. Your daughter sucks at doing the handstand. She can't do it at all! What are you talking about? What the..., Hey, stop this bullshit! Leave my daughter alone! Lotte, come on... let's get something to drink. Asshole! Mrs. Heine? I am one of Nicolas's friends. We play soccer together. Nicolas isn't home. I know... but I borrowed him my knee guards, and just wanted to ask, if I could get them back. I need them for tomorrow's game. Otherwise, I won't be allowed to play. Come in, but please take off your shoes. I have an appointment with detective Becker or Egger. Decker, chief superintendent Decker. You are standing on my foot. Oh, I am sorry. Give me your umbrella! And get me some rubber boots. Do you have any idea of when Nicolas will be back? Our team would collect some money, in order to help out. That's very kind, but I'am afraid ransom won 't help. The knee guards, they must be in the cupboard, somewhere. I didn't know that Nicolas is still playing with dolls. Not Friedolin, the rabbit, please don't touch him! Hello, I'm Friedolin. I am cold and I am all alone. Put him back! Put him back! Do you know, who I am? I think, it's time for you to leave. Mrs. Meinert? Decker, we talked on the phone. Or shoud I say doctor Meinert. Meinert is fine. Thank's for coming down so quickly. I think we can save the compliments. If I understood correctly, we are pushed for time. Who was that? Nobody. The boy was last seen when leaving school after his sixth lesson. He never arrived at home. We are still searching his way to school. Do you know what mouldy sandwiches, like them ones mean? This syndrome is almost exclusively found in boys. They don't want to eat their sandwich, but they are unable to throw it away. So the sandwiches start moulding... just like a bad conscience. Do you have kids, Mrs Meinert? I don't get along with kids. Good afternoon ladies and gentleman, may I see you tickets please? Are you also travelling without a ticket? May I? I don't mind if you need to piss, unless you need to go for a shit, that would be pretty uncool. Did that hurt? Are you pretending to be on an 'emo trip'? Because I am talking too much, or what? You look propper gay. But you have nice eyes. I need to get out of here. Cute. Pussy. What are you doing there? Oh, I am sorry... I was just thinking. Don't worry I'll take care of that! Maybe you could help me. I am looking for something personal from your son. Something that was important to him. The football. Do you have something more personal. It's signed by all players. What about this rabbit? Lost. Please take off your shoes inside the house? Mum? Mum! Get up! Come on, get up! Mathilda, why aren't you at school? It's half past seven. Did you smoke? Come on, get up. It's all right mum. I don't want to. But I don't want to. But you have to. The water is cold. Look, I made it warmer. But it's still cold. I made some Spaghetti for you, you like eating them, don 't you? I saw it, thanks. I am sick. Mama you have to take a shower. The water is cold. But I just made it warmer. But it's still cold. Mum, you smell of piss. How are you talking to me?! You shouldn't talk in this way with your mother. I am your mum. I am sorry. The water is cold. I made it warmer. AUAAAAA. IT'S BOILING! How was school? Your mother asked you something. Would you please turn of the TV. At least, as long as we're having dinner. TV: Somewhere out there, there is someone who knows where our son is. We beg you, don 't hurt our child. Did you hear what your mother said? We do whatever you want, but please give us a sign of life. Show us that our son is all right. Nicolas is a good boy... he loves playing football and he is very popular with his friends. Nicolas loves his rabbits and cares about them attentively. I am sorry, i can 't do this. Hello? Hello? Hello. Is anybody there? Hello. Is anybody there? Don't go away. Hey! Mrs. Meinert? I have a message for you. please give a call! Max If this gentleman calls again, tell him that I've left. Tank you! Yes? Hello Mrs Meinert, it's me. We have a sign of life. The mating dance of the humpback wales can last for many hours and is often accompanied by complex signing. In order to mate, the wales swim tightly along side one another, mainly upright, while their bellies are touching and they nibble on each others mouth. Mathilda, would you come to the front please? Mathilda! Please explain, how mammal fertilisation works. And take your hair out of your mouth, please! Where does the fertilisation take place? In the cunt. We found the video on many of our student's mobiles. It's like approaching dogs. Just don't show them that you are scared. That's my seat. Hi! Hello! Thank you. First of all, I am asking you all to turn off your mobile phones. If I hear one of them ring, I am going to collect them all. Well, this is Mrs. Meinert from the police. She would like to ask you a few questions. Which one of you has seen the video of Nicolas. Louder! Which one of you has seen the video of Nicolas, the boy in the cellar. No one will get into trouble if they have seen it. I watched it myself. I watched it. A friend sent it to me. And what did you think, when you saw it? The bunny was cute. I, I also watched the video, I thought it was horrorifying. I thought, it was funny. That is not funny. It clapped when he fell. I want to see the victim. Who else has seen the video? Is it real? Yes, the video is real. We are going to have one-on-one interviews with all of you now. Please let your parents know that you are going to be late. I want to see the victim, and I want an ice-cream. Mrs. Schockenhoff. Mrs. SCHOCKENHOOOFFFF!!! Yes, please. Wait for me after school. I need to pee. Name and grade, please! Nine B. Name? I don't have a name. Everybody has a name. Not me. Don't you like your name? Your name is Claudia Meinert, right. Yea. Do you have a second name? Hanne, Hannelore. And you? Did your father used to call you like that? Hanne? Why don't you just pick a name, one that you like? You don't choose names, names are given to you. Parents give their children names. It says here, your name is ... I don't have a name. Well, did you know the boy from the video? We play in the same club. And did you ever fight with him. He is very popular. I asked you, if you ever had a fight with him. Do you know anybody who has had a fight with him. Like I said, he is very popular. Maybe a bit too popular. It's says here that you are highly talented, you skipped the seventh grade. It's not easy? What? Making friends. I have other interests. For example? Girls, fashion, music. May I go now? And where exactly is your victim supposed to be? Hey, what is this shit? Switch the lights back on! Hello? I am here. Switch the lights on immediately! I am right behind you. Is the victim in here too? Yes. When are you going to make it happen? Kill the victim? I have a special plan with him beforehand. What's that? He is going to be my birthday present. I want to watch, when you do it. I want to be there, when you do it. I want to watch, when somebody is dying. Mrs. Schweizer? My name is Claudia Meinert. Did something happen to my husband? Your husband is fine. I have a few questions regarding your son. I imagined him to be much taller. Come over here! What's the matter? You wanted to see him. Now you saw him. I thought we were going do something together today. Also, I still want my ice cream. You will get your ice cream. Asshole. Give me your watch! I asked you to give me your watch! YOUR WATCH!!! May I try yours? Tomorrow is fun fair. I want you to take me there. No time. Else, I will tell everybody where your victim is. If you do that? What then? Then you'll never see someone dying. I bet, you don't dare to do it anyway. Tomorrow at five at the crawler. Is that a date. Cool. See you tomorrow. Come on you have to eat something. I am not hungry. Shall I make you a salad. I don't understand how you can eat at all. Are you Nicolas Dad? I promised Nicolas to feed his rabbits while he is away. Moritz, Finny, Schnuffy and Carl. When did you talk to Nicolas? May I come in? Sure, come in. Weren't you here yesterday? What do you want? He claims that he spoke to Nicolas. Oh, did I interrupt your dinner? Should I come back later? When exactly did you talk to Nicolas? May I have something to drink? Milk, if you have any. That is Nicolas seat. Please explain us in detail, when exactly you spoke to Nicolas. Would you make me a sandwich? Out! OUT! Anja, wait! Wait! Oh, I am sorry. It's late, my parents are waiting for me with dinner. Where did you get this watch? I want her to make me a sandwiche, with salami. And now, you are going to tell me where you got this damn watch from! I want her to make it! I know it's late, but... My wife is already asleep. Maybe it's better you come back tomorrow. I just wanted to ask if you know this boy. No! Five minutes. Give me five minutes. After that, you can do anything you want with me. He said, he knows where Nicolas is. He's got his watch. Open this door immediately. Open the door, right now! RIGHT NOW! Morning. Morning. I have a new boyfriend. Didn 't you want to buy milk? I think, I am in love. We want to go to the fair tonight. Do you have any money? You know how it works? I would be a shit grandma, you know that. Thank you. I am expecting company tonight, would be cool, if you could stay in your room. Yeah! I am a child, I am incapable of crime, whatever I do. I know the law. So, I can go now? This says, your birthday is in three days. You will turn fourteen and that means you will no longer be freed of crime. In three days, Nicolas is dead. I am tired, may I go now? We can't do anything, he knows that. We will claim charge against the father. Bring the boy home! Clarify if the parents comply their fiduciary duty. We will be observing him, day and night. What the fuck. Our Hanne is pregnant. Give it back! Did you already know, our Hanne is pregnant? That's enough! Do you already have name for the little one? Or is it going to be a little girl, a little Hanne? Will you ride the crawler with me? Just one time... I get scared on my own. I am here with my children. Otherwise, I am going to tell my mother that you touched me. I did what? You touched my tits. Are you nuts? Just one round. One little bitty round. Get off! Asshole. Sabine Meissner. Seventy, four years of age, she fell in her apartment, three weeks later the neighbours complained about the smell. Blistering on the lips, mucosal skin dried out and lacerated, the tonsils inflamed. That's how somebody looks, who died of thirst. I know it from the TV Well then, touch her. It's just a dead body. Feels like a cold apple, and now? If Nicolas dies, he will feel the same. And you will feel guilty for your entire life, because you were unable to save him. His grades are good, we have no problems with him. He is one of the best students in his year, at least in written work. I think, you didn 't really get my point. Your son committed a serious crime. Are you sure, I mean do you have any evidence? He confessed. Do you mind if I smoke? Not in the house, Cora please! Has your son changed at all recently? How were we supposed to? He barely even speaks to us. That's a change, don't you think? We thought, it's the age. Your son no longer answers to his name. I think that's not normal, don't you? Sammy, would you please hand me my coat? I am sorry, could you please repeat your question? If your son doesn't answer to his own name, to what does he answer then? Nothing. Just: Hey you. Do you remember any trigger, a fight maybe? Hejust stopped talking to us. It got worse last year. He used to work things out by himself. As I said, it got worse last year. I can't force my child to talk to me. But you try it over and over again. Yes, unlike you, I try to talk to my son, that's right. Do you still have physical contact with your son? Touching, hugs, cuddles... He is thirteen. I don't get your question. If I understand you right, your son has been socially completely isolated for more than one year now. That's right you could say that. No, that's not right. Only recently he completed an internship a student internship in the youth well-fare office. That's kind of social, isn 't it. Does that mean it's all my fault? This isn't about fault. What then? I think, you are hiding something from me. Nicolas? What do you want from me? Will this be one of this: Show me your room and I will tell you who you are thing? My self perception is disturbed. Would you please wait outside? Nietzsche said: We do not accuse nature of being immoral if it sends us a thunderstorm. Why do we call a human being immoral if he kills. No one is born evil. So, it's society's fault or that of the parents? May I have one too? Nice lighter. I gad it since I was twelve, pure brass, you won't find this anymore today. May I? You're welcome! Did your father give it to you? No, I just found in somewhere, and never lost it since. Look at the lighter! I just want to answer your question. Until now, I am nobody, just someone that you have barely known for three days. Look at the lighter! Now I am the one who broke your lighter. That has been my favourite lighter for over forty years. The more it hurts you, the deeper our relationship. You want to have a relationship with me, and therefore you brake my lighter? If this is the only way to get in contact with you. Now you will never forget me. No, this I'll never forget. And that is his motive, he want's a relationship with her at any cost. If you would be a guy, I would smack you for that. I will buy you a new one. I also know a Nietzsche saying... The one who fights with monsters needs to be careful that he doesn't turn into a monster himself. Like I said, I 'll get you an new one. May I ask you a personal question? Maybe another time. Fucking cold today. Coffee would be good. I'll go and check what's going on. Nicolas. Oh shit. Come I'll clean you. You know, that happened to me once, too I woke up because I had to pee so badly. And then? I pissed the whole bed. The next day it stank like. Like a pissed tramp. Right, like a fully pissed tramp. Come, we'll get you fresh clothes. Advertisement for telephone sex. Our people are on it. For now we can only wait. Anything new about the cellar? A cellar without any windows, every second cellar in town looks like this. Anything wrong? No. You looked at me strangely. I didn't look at you. Sure, you looked at me strangely. Here, some new games this is even adult rated. I want to go home. You can go home again, when your mother does what I say. Where were you? We had a date? No time. But for the victim you have time, or what? His name is Nicolas. You are bleeding. You are crazy, you know that? Like I said, we are a perfect match. Can I crash at your place tonight? No time. Isn't that the cop chick from school? Do you want to go swimming? Yes. Will you slide with me, I am scared alone. Faster! Come on, faster! I want an ice-cream. We have to talk. Thanks. Anja. Thank you. Thanks. Can you put some lotion on my back? Also under the bikini! Mathilda, what do want to have for dinner? What's your favourite dish? Spaghetti Bolognese. But real Bolognese, not the canned stuff. Can you make that? Yes. HELLO! HELP! HELP! HELLO! Is there anybody out there? HELLO! HELP! HELP! That's really yummy. Are you not hungry? We eat all together! I am not hungry. I want you to eat. You still have to ask how school was. How was school? Good. Good. We are eating! These are the best Spaghetti ever. May I have some more? What is this about? I am hungry. But you are not invited. Either I get some of your Spaghetti... or I will tell the others what yummy meal you have here. Which others? Would you hand me the sauce, please? I talked to you parents. They want you to come home after dinner. I stay here for the night. We stay here for the night. There are pigs outside everywhere. You are under age, that's the law. Unless we all stay here for the night. The sauce. Please! Mathilda Herwick, mother on welfare, single parent, alcohol. Father? Died, car accident, when the kid was three. Did he say what he wants? The deal is: The police retreats in return I will stay in the house. That's a shit deal. He is going to bring it to an end as long as he is incapable of crime. Nicolas has twenty eight hours left. That's a beautiful pattern. Japanese cherry blossom, the wedding gift of my parents, in law. Where shall I put it? There inside the cupboard. How long for have you known your husband? We married when I was pregnant with Nicolas. And before Raphael, was there any one else in your life. I want to feed the rabbits, they are hungry too. There. You didn't answer my question. I guess, that's none of your business. There is a mistake. Fiftysix divided by eight is seven not six. Fiftysix divided by eight is seven not six. No, the eight isn't wrong, the six is. Fortyeight divided by eight is six. Two times six is? Six. Six times two is twelve. Three times four is? Three times four. Three times four is? Six. Six times two is twelve. Three times four is? Six Not six, twelve! Six, six, six, sex. Twelve, six times two is twelve. Six, point six six six. Sex. Shall we play something? When I was a kid I had a rabbit too, his name was Franz. A birthday present from may father. Franz grew and grew, grew and grew, only at Christmas Franz got very small again. My father said, Franz becomes small, so that he freezes less. And I believed him. Until I understood that every I ate Franz every christmas. The story is made up right? Does she knows who you are? I know who you are. The game is called: Who am I. The game sucks. You don 't need to play along. I want to be Lady Gaga. The game is different. The person to your left decides who you are and he or she writes it on a piece of paper and then stick it onto your forehead. I am sorry but I can 't do that. Everyone will play along. Please stay here. You can only ask questions that can be answered with yes or no. CUNT His, I don 't get it. sorry, but... You start, you have to ask who you are! Am I evil? Good question. Someone did evil to you but you also performed evil by yourself, yes you are evil. Am I sexy. It's not your turn until he gets a no. Have I ... killed Nicolas. Do you want some more juice? No, you haven 't killed Nikolas. Now it's Anjas turn. Mrs. Heine it's your turn. Am I female? For sure. That's insane. ''There was an old spinster ofTyre. Who bellowed, My cunt is on fire!'' So a fireman was found, brought his engine around, and extinguished her burning desire. Where is my son? Nicolas was so scared, he peed himself. He screamed mummy, mummy but he never said anything about daddy. Stay, please! Do you want to know who you are? I thought it's my turn? I give you a hint. I want to ask something, too! Your parents wanted to tell you, when you are old enough to understand. But then you found your adoption certificate. By accident or did you search for it. Did you sense that they are not your real parents? Am I sexy? You are an anonymous birth. Your biological parents are unknown. This game sucks. How does it fell, when you don 't know who you are, and where you come from? When our own mother doesn 't want you? Then he felt very bashful, and tucked his head under his wing. He did not know what this was all about. He felt so very happy, but he wasn't at all proud, for a good heart never grows proud. He thought about how he had been persecuted and scorned, and now he heard them all call him the most beautiful of all beautiful birds. The lilacs dipped their clusters into the stream before him, and the sun shone so warm and so heartening. He rustled his feathers and held his slender neck high, as he cried out with full heart: ''I never dreamed there could be so much happiness, when I was the ugly duckling.'' Beautiful ending. You forgot the good night kiss. The boy was handed in by an unknown person in the baby flap of the children's hospital Albert Sabin. The Infant was hypothermic and regarding the umbilical cord at least 24 hours old. He was treated medically and at the end of an eight, week period given up for adoption. The infant was 24 hours old, that means his birthday is tomorrow not the day after. With Foundlings, the handover date is classified as the official date of birth. The real date is known solely by the mother. Who gave the child his name? The adoptive parents. Until then the infant remained nameless. In the provisional certificate of birth, is an X instead of the name. I didn't know you are a bastard. Promise, that you never stand me up again, like the funfair. Will you promise me that? Are you gay? Don't you like me? Your tits are too small. Asshole. Is it possible to find out, who the mother of the child is? With baby flaps, no chance, everything is anonymous. But six months later, a young women appears in the youth welfare office and claims to be the mother of the child. She wanted her child back, but the adoption was already completed. Did she try to contact her child? She did, but the adoptive parents refused it. Her name was included in the documents, nothing else could be done for her. Her maiden name was Anja Wehling. Today she is called Heine. Hello Claudia, are you still there? He did an internship in the youth wellfare office. Leave me alone? You and your wife, how did you get to know one other. At the university cafeteria , she didn't like her meal, I gave her mine. You did not know anything about this? Five days ago, we werejust a normal family. Why didn't tell me about this! You lied to me! 12 years! I'm your husband! It's all about OUR child. There's no sense...talk to me now! What do you want? I want to sleep in bed with mummy. Shit. I can 't sleep. Nobody has ever read to me. I heard about your father. My father died when I was al little kid, too. You can save your psycho stuff. I don 't know where the victim is. Morning. You look totally gay. And you have no clue how to do it properly. One line here. But not too strong, your lashes are already quite dark. And now this. What's going on here? I don 't know. Surprise! How nice that you were born, we would have really missed you otherwise. ''how nice that we're all together; we congratulate you, birthday child!'' Happy Birthday. Aren't you happy? My birthday is tomorrow, not today. Tomorrow? Your birthday is today. Tomorrow. No, today. You have to blow out the candles. I am afraid I don't have a present for you, cause I only just heard about it. But I have a present for you. Here you are. Your name is written on the present. I don't have a name. I gave it to you, when you were born. Tell me where Nicolas is, then I tell you your name. Tell me, where Nicolas is? Then I will give you your name. He is in the cellar of the water park. Marienbad, where we were yesterday? Where is your telephone? Your telephone! Happy Birthday, Leon. I want you to go now. Leave my house and never come back! I thought, we would celebrate together. You are arrested provisionally. What? You can 't do that, we are kids. As of today no longer. Come on! You promised that we celebrate his birthday today, all together. You promised it! No, you promised it. But you promised it. A promise is a promise! Don't you want to say Good Bye at least? Bye. A Real Good Bye! Bye. Bye. Hands up! Into the cellar you pussies! Where is my child? They didn't find him. WHERE IS MY CHILD?...WHERE IS MY CHILD? ...WHERE IS MY CHILD? You fucked it up. There is no way back for him now. He will not do it. Go and get a rest Mrs. Doctor, we can handle this from here. You look tiered. Crazy, you actually look quite similar. At least if you know it. Look at the mouth, it looks just like yours. Look the corners of the mouth! You just can 't see it, because of the... the.... Mathilda, I am trying to concentrate here. Sorry. You are scared like shit. Of cause I am scared, do I look like a psycho, or what? I can do it for you. The cops will fuck you. They will fuck me anyway. Your mother loved his mouth more than yours. Although you have the same. We don 't have the same mouth. Why not, you are brothers? Half brothers. Brothers, half brothers, fuck it! You have the same mouth. Mathilda, would you please wait outside? Mathilda, would you please wait outside! I bet, you don't dare it. Give it back! It's mine, I stole it! But the victim is mine. Noisless: I'm sorry! Shit! The mother opens the flap from the outside and puts her baby here into the bed. The bed detects that there is a child and automatically warms up. If the flap closes again, a silent alarm is set off and we take care of the baby. Really quite simple. Do some mothers leave something for their children, some kind of keepsake? Whatever we find next to the child we keep in these envelopes. From the age of sixteen, the children have the right to inspect these things. May I see the boy's envelope ? Do you know what's in there? Sometimes a bad past is better than none. Anna Heinzke, I baptise you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Anna Heinzke, I baptise you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord lift his countenance upon you, and be gracious to you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and give you peace. Amen. Come! You are going to get your birthday present. Today is you birthday, we have to celebrate that. As long as the pussys are singing this house is ours. Relax! I swear, there is booze somewhere. To you! Here drink! Drink! It will make you relax. Drink! This will be my birthday present. Do you like what you see? Do you like me? Then show me! Show me that you like me! Happy Birthday, Leon. If I ask you for something, will you do it? No matter what it is? Yes. Tomorrow at breakfast with mum and dad, we will bring it to an end. Leon? I will bring the buns. We have this more often, sometimes stones, vomit, deposit bottles... you can forget that, the alarm has a delay of fifteen minutes, ... so that the mother stays anonymous. I am here. Your father raped me. I am sorry, Mum. Had a nice day? Morning. Awake so early? Yes. I would like to have four of these normal buns. Two custard tarts and... another two of these cross, stuff. You will talk now, and we keep out of it. What do you want? Tell me who I am. Did you know him? Did you know him? I was drunk. I just wanted to forget all that. Three weeks later I was pregnant. Why didn't you abort me? I was still covered by my parents' health insurance. Bullshit. I was ashamed. I thought it was all my fault I shouldn't have drank so much. And then? What then? I got you. Where? WHERE! On the toilet. Alone on the toilet. You were screaming all the time. I did not know what to do? When the flap closed, I felt so relieved, ...like all this never happened. Did you give Nicolas the breast? Did you suckle him? Yes. Me too? No. If you amputate someone's leg, he can still feel it tickling, even years later. When Nicolas is dead, where will it tickle you? You didn't do it. I know Nicolas is well. You want to see him? It's no pretty sight. Let me alone. I hate you. I am sorry. I am so sorry. Hello? We will now eat breakfast all together. Like a real family? Hello? ...Hello? I brought buns? Would you hand me the jam, please? Strawberry, please. Thank you. Oh, the coffee is ready. Milk? The weather is so beautiful today. Shall we go for a walk? But you promised it. A promise is a promise. You promised it. You can 't do that. A promise is a promise. You always fool me. You always promise something but you never keep it. A PROMISE IS A PROMISE! Asshole! Mum! Dad! Say, that you love me! Say it! Leon? Leon, I...I would like to see you... I forgot Mathilda. I forgot Mathilda. Me too. Claudia... are you all right? I have tried to reach you all the time. I have to tell you something. Just come in for now.
