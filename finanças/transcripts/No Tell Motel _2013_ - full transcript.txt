( Silence ) ♫ ( Squeaking ) Mama, look at me! Mama! Mama! Here, bunny, bunny. Here, bunny, bunny. Here, bunny, bunny. Here, bunny, bunny. Here, bunny, bunny. Here, bunny, bunny. ( Tires screech ) Tell me again why we took this road. It's the scenic route. More like the anemic route. I heard that! Highway would've been faster. It's a long weekend. This is supposed to be fun. Fun is a cold beer at the end of a long dock. Here's to that. Hey, we're not lost, right? No, we're not lost... Yet. Ugh, get a room. ( Yawns ) Are we there yet? If, by "there", you mean "nowhere", then, yeah, we've been there for the last 30 minutes. Hey, the roads are supposed to hook up... Somewhere. I found your lack of specifics a wee bit disturbing. Ohh, how soon? My legs keep falling asleep? All of you keeps falling asleep. Ow. Can we find somewhere to stop? I'm not feeling very good. At least you don't have to ride back here while these two flirt with each other. ( Rattling ) Oh, shit! That does not sound good. "Oh, shit"? What "oh, shit"? When was the last time you changed the oil? I'm supposed to do that? Tell me you're kidding. Oh, god, I think i'm gonna be sick. Roll down the window. Not in the r.V., Megan. Not in the r.V.! Pull over! Can you make it another minute or two, meggie? Mm-mm. Sure you don't need help with that? No, I got it. Just needs oil. Ah! Do you have a pharmacy section? In the back. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Shit! Is that what you're doing in there? Oh, fuck! Hurry up, man! Fuck you, Spencer. Fucking piece of shit! Hey, you find the glory hole yet? Fucking cocksucker. God. Well, I guess we should be going, huh? Oh, honey. You can't tell Kyle. Uh, cross my heart and hope to die. Or anyone. I'm really embarrassed. It's okay. Everybody needs a secret, you know? Keeps life more interesting. Boo! Spencer... You're so scary. What's the secret? Oh, nothing, i'm just madly in love with you. I knew it. I knew you were. Ha ha! Stop it. ( Imitates static ) And our tour begins anew, folks. If you look to your right, you'll notice... A tree. What the-- was that even there before? I told you we should've taken the highway. Hey, easy, come on. Will you slow down? Kyle! We have to make up time. Kyle, slow down. She said she was sick. Look, i'm feeling sick, too, all right? Everyone shut the fuck up and let me concentrate. Will you please be careful? Listen, Rachel, we know it's your dad's shitty r.V. We've heard it a million fucking times! Well, this should be a fun weekend. No shit. You gotta slow it down, man. I'm not playing with you right now. Look, I got it! Shut up! ( Screaming ) Is everyone okay? Jesus h. Christ on a buttered fucking cracker. Rachel, talk to me. What-- what did Kyle do? I didn't do anything. Spencer: You were driving like an asshole! I don't need help. It's not happening. Flag someone down. Right... It being a major highway and all. Someone needs to go back to the gas station. They said it ws closing. Then we need to make it quick. I'm not leaving the r.V. Fine. I'll go. I'll go with you. Think you can keep up? This is my fault. Yeah, no shit. Rachel. What? Stop. Dude, I am in so much trouble. My dad's gonna kill me. ( Rattling ) Guys, you gotta come see this. Come on. Check it out! I bet they have a vending machine. Twinkies keep, like, 20 years. This is a joke, right? What happened to the gas station? It was closed. Damn it. So you think we should stay here? Definitely a joke. Guys, we're supposed to be roughing it. How much worse could it be? Hey, grow a pair. It could be fun. Look, they're your friends, not mine. He's your brother, not mine. Fine, whatever. Let's just do this, all right? It's about time someone showed some spirit! Speaking of spirits... Ladies? Rachel? What, do you see something? Nothing worth telling the girls about. Hey, guys? Hello? Who are you talking to? I don't know. After you, my lady. Spencer, no. Come on. It'll be an adventure. Fine. This is really weird. Relax, guys, it's not that bad. Oh, shit. There's flares and flashlights in the r.V. Perfect. I am gonna tongue-kiss your dad. If no one comes tonight, i'll run up to the gas station when the sun's up. So that's it, then? We're just decided? We're staying? There's still some life in the Springs here, rach. What do you say, huh? I'd say that I think you're a perv. Oh. But, uh, I will take you up on that whiskey. Hmm. Finally alone. Mm. I'm not drunk yet. Yet? ( Sighs ) You ever played motel Bible fortune cookie? So what you do is, you pick a random quote from the Bible, and you add "in bed" afterward. Oh. That sounds incredibly gay. Oh, ye of little faith. "There is nothing covered, "that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall be not known..." In bed. There's no way that was random. ( Laughter ) Oh, shit. Spencer. Oh, no. Oh, my god. Spencer: What? Hey, what's up, meggie? Sorry. I, uh, forgot something in the r.V. No, we got everything! What happened? ( Scoffs ) I don't know. ( Sobbing ) Kyle is so paranoid. We've been so careful. Look, it's okay. This happens all the time. Whatever it was, it was clearly private. And who made you den mother? Who made you captain of the football team? Oh, wait. That was before you blew out your knee. I cannot believe you went there. ( Panting ) Spencer: Hey, bro, everything okay in there? Mind your business! ( Grunting ) No, the Halloween party-- that has to be it. It doesn't matter when it happened. It happened. I was so drunk, and i-- I blacked out, and I woke up at home. We must have-- you can't say this to anyone. My lips are sealed. You always say that. I promise. You can trust me, Megan. Okay. Fine. You want to be even? Do you want to know why I never drive? My daddy bought me a $40,000 s.U.V. For my sweet 16. It was the last night of my senior year. I was driving to a party on the lake. ( Sighs ) It was raining, but they said there'd be a big tent. And I was drinking 'cause there was gonna be college guys there. ( Laughs ) God. Like college guys are so great. I just-- god, I remember feeling so free. Like I had the whole world in front of me. The only thing I had in front of me was a boy on a bike. Why are you telling me that? I mean, I felt it. I felt him. I saw him lying there on the road. I saw him in my mirror. And I didn't stop. I know what it's like to live with a secret. Now you know what it's like to live with someone else's. Kyle: Meggie! Oh, no. Tell him you had to comfort me. What if he asks why? Tell him it's a secret. Hey. Hey. Sorry. I tried to stop him. Hey, are you okay? No, i'm fine. I just--can I just have a minute, please? Yeah. Sure. ( Squeaking ) ( Crying ) Hello? Hello? Little girl, where are your parents? Sweetheart? Sweetheart, you must be in shock. You need to come with me, okay? Little girl? Sweetheart? You need to come with me, okay? Little girl? ( Gasping ) Aaaah! ( Tires screech ) Someone's here! Rachel! ( Gasping ) Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Spencer: No, Rachel, no. How the fuck did they miss the flares? Ohh. Oh, god. Help me get him out of here. You actually want to help this drunk, after what he just did? What, you want to just let him die here? He killed Rachel. He needs our help. ( All grunting ) ( Sighs ) He'll make it till tomorrow... Won't he? I don't know. Hey, maybe there's something in the office we can use. You'll be fine. Yeah. I'll be fine. ♫ ( Ding ) Uhh! ( Clanging, music playing ) ( Creaking ) ( Grunting ) Fuck. Oh! ( Grunting ) ( Crying ) Aah! ( Gasps ) ( Gasping ) ( Bell dings ) ( Corey sobbing ) Give me some of that. God damn it, Spence, please. All right, cool. Just take it easy, man. Don't spill. Lovely. Do you really think you should be drinking right now? What are you doing? Kyle. Uhh! Uhh! Hey. What?! What, you want to rescue me, too? Kyle, you need to stay calm. You don't want to get like before. What's that supposed to mean? When you couldn't play football anymore. I told you I never wanted to talk about that again! It's just sports! Jesus, meggie. I'm sorry. Don't. Go help Corey or something. Just leave me alone! Corey? Corey, are you here? Kyle? Corey, where are you? Kyle, be careful. ( Gasps ) Kyle, someone's here. Holy shit. Holy shit. We're not alone. I'll go get help. No, don't leave me down here, please. But I can't get you out by myself. No, there's someone down here! Please help me! Okay, fine, yeah. All right, all right. Um... i'll go find something, okay? Like a ladder or stairs, all right? And i'll talk to you the whole way through. All right? Okay. Here, here. Take this. Uhh! All right, um... I'm just gonna be in the next room, all right? I'll be right back. Please hurry. I'll be right back. Hey, I think I can get you out of there! Oh, thank god. What'd you find? Kyle, are you okay? Kyle? Looks like you could use a drink. I thought you were out. Never leave home without back-up. ( Both laugh ) ( Sobbing ) ( Crying ) Kyle, god damn it! Aah! Aah! ( Screaming ) ( Footsteps ) In here. Hey. ( Faucet squeaks, water runs ) ( Gasping ) ( Gasps ) Mary! No! ( Grunting ) ( Mary screaming ) No! ( Screaming ) ( Both screaming ) I'm sorry. No. I want to help. At least someone does. I don't like how he talks to you. He's just upset, that's all. What are you doing? I--i thought we just connected. Well, you're wrong. Okay. He's your brother. He is. Rachel's dead! Okay, got it! Forgive the fuck out of me! Where are you going? I'm gonna have a smoke. Does that pass your ethics test? Man: Mary. Mary, wake up. Mary. Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? Ohh. ( Grunting ) Uhh! ( Grunting ) Hang on. ( Grunting ) ( Grunting ) Aah! ( Grunting ) Aaah! Guys? Corey? Oh, my god. Corey? Kyle? ♫ This is disgusting. ( Gunshot ) Oh! Oh, shit! Sorry, Spence. Whoa, don't sneak up on me like that! Sneak up?! I just called your name! Jesus Christ on a fucking crutch, man. Where did you get that thing? ( Gasps ) And this is proof someone's here? It's a tall guy, taller than me. Uh-huh. Did you see any unicorns or dancing leprechauns? If mom and dad could see you now. Don't tell Megan. Whatever, man. But if you have a problem, she deserves to know. Mum's the word. We should probably get back, huh? What about Corey, bro? Oh, she's in the hole. What? Are you kidding me? Corey! You think one of us should climb down? You really are high. Well, what else are we gonna do? Look for some stairs. Come on! I remember coming back from the store. That's about it. I hope my car fared better than me. It's totaled, isn't it? Son of a gun. What? Was someone else hurt? Are they okay? You shouldn't have been drinking. I try not to. It's a sickness. Please. You drove over my best friend. We had to drag her body into a ditch! Oh, no. No. What's your name? Matthew... Hogan. Well, Matthew, when morning comes, you can turn yourself in. But for tonight, it looks like you're staying here with us. Where is here, anyway? Oh, boy. Whoa, what you got? Oh, great. Now what? We use the key. What key? Oh.that key. What's so bad about this place? ( Gunshot ) That's the second one. No, wait, wait. I grew up around here. There are stories about this place. The former owners-- they lost their daughter. And then they lost their minds. They died... In a most unattractive manner. What does this have to do with us? I think they still live here. Whew. You can go first... If you want. Corey? Megan: I don't believe in ghosts. Did you see anything weird tonight? You mean besides my best friend being hit in the middle of the road? That's how she died, you know. The little girl. A pickup came barreling down that same blind path. She was in the road. God knows why. Tell me everything. Corey? Corey? ( Door creaks ) Hey. Shh. Kyle! What did you do? You gotta help me here, please! I didn't do anything. Come on! Kyle, you gotta get me out of here! The door's stuck! What am I supposed to do? I don't know. Pull the gun out and shoot the door. Kyle. Shh. What do you mean, "shh"? What are you doing? Kyle? Grigor horak bought this place back in the '60s. Horak--is that German? Polish. Second-generation. He met his wife-- Mary, I think her name was-- and she came here to live with him. What was the little girl's name? Angela. ( Rapid breathing ) Spencer: Kyle! Matthew: The other three bodies wouldn't have been discovered till 1975. The other... three? Yeah. But i'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with Mary. She took angela's death brutal hard. A few days after the funeral, she went down to the basement, poured herself a nice, hot bath and slashed her wrists. She killed herself? Tried to. Grigor apparently saved her. How do you know? Because... The real way she died... Is so much worse. ( Clatter ) Grigor? Here. Please. Eat. Why are you doing this? You need your strength. Please, grigor. She's gone. Let me go, too. ( Breathing heavily ) I won't lose you. ( Sobbing ) You already lost me. ( Screaming ) You can't keep me here forever! Someone will find me! Someone will help me! ( Screaming ) There is no longer vacancy! If you truly cared for me... You wouldn't keep me suffering. You're right. Then do it, grigor. Please, please, please do it! Do it! They say the root cellar was littered with vials. You couldn't take a step without breaking glass. How long did he keep her down there? Long. ( Thud ) ( Sobbing ) Matthew. Matthew. Did you see a little girl? He's in shock. Oh, yeah? He killed Rachel. Where's Corey? Where's Spencer? I'm seeing things. Kyle? Kyle? God damn it. You're one hell of a withdrawal symptom-- i'll give you that. ( Panting ) Truth be told, i've never been fond of hallucinations. Especially creepy little girls. No offense. ( Moaning ) Good idea. This shit's weak. ( Door creaks ) Kyle? Hey, man... I just ran out of booze, so my tolerance for this shit has officially hit sub-zero. I don't get it. It feels like it's working. But you're still here. You're being awfully nice to me, considering the circumstances. That's me-- awfully nice. Did you take something from me? Sorry. It was Kyle. He's been really weird tonight. Who's Kyle? My boyfriend. Oh. Hey, there's something under here. I'll get it. No, it's okay. Is this... He gave her so much. They could've kept this place open and nobody would've heard a thing. ( Giggling ) Grigor: Ma-a-ary? Mary... Quite contrary. ( Giggling ) ( Gasping ) Just how does your garden grow, hmm? With silver bells... ( Giggles ) And... And cockle shells and pretty maids... All... in a row. ( Panting ) ( Grunts ) Spencer! Downstairs! What? Oh, my god. What happened? You're alive? What happened downstairs? I found someone dead down there. What? In the cellar. What about Corey? Oh, shit. Where is she? I don't know! We need to find her. I'm not going back down there! Rachel's already-- I don't know if you've noticed, but there's some seriously fucked-up juju going on here. Please, Spencer, don't make me do this alone. God damn it! You're a real piece of work, you know that? Hey. Thank you. Okay. This was your idea. Corey? Corey? Corey? Corey? Corey? No, this can't be happening. I never knew that. You think you know someone. Why didn't she ever tell me? Jesus, meggie, I don't know. People keep secrets from each other, okay? Now can we please just get the fuck out of here? What are you doing? I think I know who's doing this. Who? Megan? Kyle? Kyle? He said he saw her. We have to get in there. All right, all right. ( Grunting ) Kyle? Oh, my god! What? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Get him up. Kyle? ( Grunting ) ( Sobbing ) Kyle? Come on. Kyle. Kyle. Oh, Jesus. Oh, man. Come on, bud. Wake up, Kyle, please! ( Sobbing ) Come on, man. Kyle? Kyle! No! Stop. He's gone. No. ( Mutters ) God, Spencer. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. We need to get out of here. Angela. No! Oh! No! ( Grunting ) Kyle was an idiot. Spencer. He was a decent enough brother, but I never respected him. He's dead. Yeah, I know. And if i'm gonna die tonight, i'm gonna tell you how I feel. This isn't the time. It never is. Do you have any idea how you used to shrink when you were around him? You're a strong a smart girl, meggie. And I just want you to know that I see that. Thanks. Um... There's something else I need to tell you. Okay. You're not gonna like it. What? I've always had a crush on you. That's okay. No. Because I acted on it. What do you mean? Halloween. What about it? I did something bad. What'd you do? All my life, i've seen Kyle get whatever he wants. What did you do, Spencer? ( Sighs ) I put something in your drink. Something? It got you a little... You know. You're not telling me this. Kyle was wasted, so I took you back to my house and I, uh-- I slept with you. I'm sorry, Megan. I know it was wrong. But you did it anyway. I love you, Megan. I've loved you for so long. No, you're sick. No! I have. Get away from me! You know what? I'm glad you told me. Really? Yeah. You want to know why? Because now I know whose baby i'm carrying. You're pregnant? Yeah. I found out tonight. Are you sure? I mean, maybe it's kyle's-- it's not. How do you know? Did you use a condom when you raped me? Megan, it wasn't rape. Then what was it? You're my secret admirer-- why don't you tell me? Just leave me alone. You think you can confess that sin and be done with it? Look, back off! ( Door creaks ) Holy fuck. Megan! I'm sorry. I've had it with secrets. Okay, Angela. Show me the way. ( Gasps ) Ah, damn it! Hello? Uh, my-- my name is Megan. Yours is Angela, right? I just want to talk, to find out what happened here. I know about your parents. Um... They loved you very much. And when they lost you-- I can't imagine losing a child. I can't imagine having a child. I know you're hurt, and I know you're angry, but-- but why are you hurting other people? Hurting other people doesn't fill the holes inside of us. It just creates more holes. Maybe if--if someone knew your secrets... You wouldn't be so angry. You could be free from all of this. Just tell me. I won't tell a soul. ( Gasps ) ( Screaming ) Grigor. Yes, my dear. It's happening. I will get my things. Thank you. Thank you for giving me a second chance. ( Screaming ) No. I want to feel the pain. I understand. Push. ( Screaming ) Push, Mary! ( Screaming ) Push! Push, Mary! Push! Push, Mary! It's coming! ( Screaming ) Push! I can see it! Oh, god! ( Gasping ) It's here, Mary. ( Baby crying ) It's okay. You're so strong. Such a strong boy. Please... Let me see. Such a strong boy. Such a strong boy. My baby. My little girl. It is a boy. Can we name him Angela? Hush. We are a family once more. We are a family. ( Gasps ) ( Baby crying ) ( Grunting ) ( Crying continues ) My baby! My baby! No! My baby! No! ( Sobbing ) No! No! ( Screaming ) Aaaah! Easy, easy. Breathe, breathe. ( Sobbing ) She killed him! I know. She couldn't reach for the baby, and they both died down there! Oh, god! You shouldn't come down here. I had to know how the story ended. Easy, Megan. Easy. It was horrible. It's not safe for someone in your condition to be this upset. My condition? What do you mean, my condition? Just-- Rachel and Spencer are the only people I told. Told what? You were in the other room, weren't you, eavesdropping? You had a scare. No! No! No! Let me go! ( Gasps ) You can trust me. No. ( Whimpering ) I really didn't want it to be this way. ( Screaming ) I don't expect you to understand. Ohh! I mean it! I don't want to fight! Aah! I can't let you go! Oh, god, you're hurting me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'd never do anything to hurt the baby. You're crazy. I am not. You're crazy! Don't run! ( Grunting ) You can come back down now, or I can come up. Either way, it ends the same. How does it end, Matthew? With a beginning. Stay away from me! ( Grunting ) ( Gasping ) There's no reason we have to fall to their level. Ohh! Bitch! Megan! Megan! No! No! ( Screaming ) Ohh! This isn't over! Do you hear me?! ( Panting ) Come on. ( Engine won't start ) ( Sobbing ) Start! Come on, god damn it! Start! ( Engine won't start ) Oh, my god. ( Gasps ) ( Groans ) ( Gasps ) You killed Rachel on purpose. True. But, to be fair, the crash was a bit more convincing than I intended. ( Sobbing ) When I came to, I saw your face. Beautiful face. ( Sobbing ) And I knew it was all worth it. Why are you doing this?! Because you haven't heard the rest of the horak story. I thought it was over. Not anymore. ( Groaning ) You see, Mary did die down here. Massive blood loss. But something interesting happened before she died. I'll let her show you. No, I don't want to see anymore! ( Baby babbling ) Seen enough? She saved the baby. She saved me. ( Sobbing ) They found me in a parking lot, wrapped in a blanket. It didn't take me long before I realized I was adopted. I asked about my birth parents, but nobody would tell me. They all just had that same haunted look on their face. ( Sobbing ) Get off me! ( Screaming ) Easy. What are you doing?! No! No! Don't--don't worry! I have no intention of treating you the way father did mother. What are you doing?! No! No! ( Sobbing ) Every time I drove by this place, it's like I could feel this pull, you know? Like there was something special here. ( Sobbing ) And there was. Megan, meet Angela. Angela... Meet your new mommy. Don't worry. You'll be perfect. Not like the others. You've done this before? You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff. ( Sobbing ) And there's a lot of chaff, isn't there, Angela? Your friends, for instance. Hit-and-run, attempted suicide, drugs, rape. You need to choose better company. Please let me go! But you-- you're different. Soft-spoken, intelligent, passionate. The perfect mother. But your real parents are here. Please. They're too busy reliving the past to help us. Angela and I are focused on building a future. No! No, don't! Aaaah! You'll come to understand. ( Screaming ) Everything takes time. Spencer: Stop right there. Antipsychotics? Some heavy shit, Mr. horak! You're a bit more resilient than you look. Shut up and untie her. I can't do that. And why not? Because fate tied those ropes. Well, free will is gonna pull this trigger. Spencer, look out! ( Gunshot ) Aah! No! ( Clicking ) ( Grunting ) Spencer, please hurry! I'm gonna get you out of here. Hurry. Hurry! You okay? ( Grunting ) Get off of him! ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) My baby. You killed my baby! Oh, my god. Sorry, Angela. We'll make you a new brother. It's just gonna take a little longer. I had to. ( Sobbing ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Spencer? Spencer? ( Groans ) Oh! ( Gasping ) You need to stay calm. Okay. Can you untie me? Come on, meggie. Don't call me that. Oh. We've had a long night, the both of us. Just--just-- just untie me, and we can talk about it. I don't think so. What do you mean? Where are you going? Meg? Come on. Is this about Halloween? I'm sorry! You just--you-- you can't leave me down here alone. Oh, you're not alone. Aah! Aah! She just wants a little company. Wait! Are you gonna tell someone i'm down here? You gonna tell somebody to come get me, Megan? Actually, Spencer... This'll be our little secret. No. No. Megan, don't leave me! Don't leave me, Megan! Megan! Megan, Megan, what are you-- don't leave me! Megan, what are you-- no! Come on! Megan! No, don't leave me down here, please! Megan, please don't leave me down here! Megan! Aah! Uhh! Megan! ♫ ♫ ♫ yeah, hey ♫ ♫ yeah, yeah ♫ ♫ don't ask, don't tell ♫ ♫ I wish you well ♫ ♫ that is the last she said to me ♫ ♫ oh, god, I know ♫ ♫ won't change, won't grow ♫ ♫ this is the last story ♫ ♫ come ahead ♫ ♫ come ahead ♫ ♫ she was the night, she was my life ♫ ♫ all the while, the neighbors gossiping ♫ ♫ can be forgot, won't be for naught ♫ ♫ 'cause now we're both unraveling ♫ ♫ and i'm over the hill ♫ ♫ i'm over it ♫ ♫ don't stop, hold her ♫ ♫ when the nights get colder ♫ ♫ when the world turns over ♫ ♫ from the back to the front page ♫ ♫ don't get higher, she's alone, she's tired ♫ ♫ and in no way sober ♫ ♫ now she's back on the front page ♫ ♫ yeah, yeah ♫ ♫ you know I know ♫ ♫ the way that goes ♫ ♫ we are exactly just the same ♫ ♫ and you're not forgot ♫ ♫ won't be for naught ♫ ♫ the world will not forget your name ♫ ♫ it's inside me, yeah ♫ ♫ and i'm over it ♫ ♫ don't stop, hold her, when the nights get colder ♫ ♫ when the world turns over ♫ ♫ from the back to the front page ♫ ♫ don't get higher, she's alone, she's tired ♫ ♫ and in no way sober ♫ ♫ now she's back on the front page ♫ ♫ yeah ♫ ( Vocalizing ) ♫ Oh, no ♫ ♫ Oh, no ♫ ♫ back on the front page ♫ ♫ yeah ♫ ♫ back on the front page ♫
