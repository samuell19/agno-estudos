- Mami? - Hmm? You're not cooking for an entire army. Come sit with us. You're right. It's an old habit. When my husband was alive, he had a cattle farm right across the lake, on the Mexico side of the border. I would cook... lunch and dinner... for him and his workers. It was like an army. You still have that cattle farm? No. I'm sure your life is much more exciting. Exciting, yes. Though... most times I wish it were boring. Why would you say that? I would love to have an exciting life. Sometimes the excitement can be a good thing. But too much excitement... there are variables. Variables? Like... like what? There are many ungrateful people in my line of work. What type of work do you do? I'm like a... tour guide. That's weird! I mean, they signed up for the tour, right? That's what I say. I always warn them what type of trip they're signing up for. But still they complain, want to turn around, go home... They should go home. Don't spoil the trip for everyone else. I wish it were that easy. So what do you do with them? Mija, please. Let him enjoy his food. Hmm? Sorry. I just... I wanna travel... I would love to be tourist. I'm saving money to go somewhere. I was just like you when I was younger. But take it from me... when you spend many years travelling from place to place... you grow to miss your home. Can we offer you anything else? How about some coffee? That sounds wonderful. It's taking forever. Be patient, hija. Do you like sugar in your coffee? Mami? - Mami. - Hmm? Found it. What do you think? Is he worth it? Yes. Very good, Ester. - Where's Dirk, Mama? - I don't know. You know how he can be. - I'm gonna go find him. - No, no, no... Let's wait until darker. What if he wakes up? He will not. He drank the entire glass. Basket is ready. See? A peaceful death. What? What do you want, Dirk? Stop staring at me, you freak. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait. I have food for you. Uh, uh... please, take it. Take it. I'm sorry. Sit down, mija. What happened? You gave them food? I'm not mad at you. Why couldn't they stay here? You know... they didn't have enough money to make them worth it. And probably, they don't deserve it. They seemed like good people. Exactly! So why couldn't we just help them? One night. Some food. We could have done that for them. Those poor people. Left for dead by those coyotes, and the coyotes we let in our house. Mm-hmm. Yes. And we give those coyotes what they deserve. Hmm? Like Mario. He seemed nice, but... what do you think he meant when he talked about tourists? Tourists. Still... we could have helped them. I heard you yelling at Dirk. Did he do something to you? No. I just... don't understand why he has to stay here. He barely helps. I can do what he does. Ai, mija. Do you keep him here because... - you love him? - No! Ester... as soon as we have the money, we will leave... for good. Hmm? And I promise you, I promise you... it will just be us. No Dirk. Hmm? Yes. - I'm fine, thank you. - What do you need? I need... my mom's medicine. And another bottle of the sleeping pills and the muscle relaxants. Pero, you took a bottle of those pills not too long ago. - You must be careful, Ester. - I know, I know. My... my mom, she misplaced them. And she's in so much pain, she can't even sleep without them. - I'm sorry. - Just be careful. Maybe this time you hold on to them so she does not get them lost. - Right? - Yeah, yeah, I'll try. What size are you, Ester? Excuse me? Pretty girl like you wearing the boy clothes? You hide behind those shirts. You need to wear a pretty dress. - Doña Rosa, really, it's OK! - Ya, Ester. Mija... don't be scared, eh? Just stay out of their way. Now take this bag. Promise me you'll wear them. And make sure your mother doesn't lose those pills. I will. Where did you leave the truck? Far away? Take a shower. Tonight, you can come to my room. Hmm? You have to do this. Yes, show me. OK... OK, be careful. - Hello. - Hello. Would you happen to have a room available for tonight? Yeah. Come in. Sir? Sir, I brought you some Jamaicawater. Thank you. Miss, Miss, Miss. You... You need to help us. I'm sorry. We don't have any rooms available. Listen, listen. My friend's in the car and he's... he's badly hurt. - Please... - I can't help you, I'm sorry. Listen, all right? Look. He... he's been shot, all right? There's a hospital. Look, OK? I'm not giving you a choice. Now, come down here, come on. - Faster, faster, to the truck. - OK, OK. - Ester? - Hey! - Mami! - You, walk towards me. Come on. - Is anybody else in the house? - We have a guest inside. He will not awake. He had a lot to drink. You. You. Down... down here. Come. Hurry. Go with her. Get to the car and help my friend out of there. Give him some tequila. In the cabinet. He needs to go to the hospital. Enough about the hospital, it's not an option. Get out of the way and let your mom take care of it. Move! Give me the tequila! Hold him. Hold him. OK, all right. Hurry up! OK, OK, two more minutes. OK. It's OK. What was that? Huh? Who is that? - Answer me. - It's Dirk. What? You told me the guest wouldn't wake up. Dirk works here. The guest is still sleeping. - You fucking lied to me? - No. No. You asked who was in the house. - He wasn't in the house. - Don't get smart with me, OK? - Just listen... - Don't move. No, no, no, mija, no! Call him. Dirk, the kitchen. Shh! OK. Hey. Move, move. Don't move, OK? Is anybody else gonna show up? No, no. Only the guest. Nobody else lives here. We rent rooms but it's rare for us to have guests. Come here, move. Don't move, stay there. All right, over there. Turn around. Turn around. OK, OK, OK... Everyone give me their cell phones. Right now, come on. Is that it? Fine. Now I want to check the rest of the house, all of the rooms. All right? You and you, you're coming with me. - Let's go. Let's go. - Yeah, OK, OK. Move it, move it. - All right, now that one. - No, no, that's the guest room. - So what? - What if we wake him up? Open the damn door! - OK, open the door. - Come on. Let's go. OK, OK, OK. OK. - Is this is the only guest? - Yes, it's the only one. What a mess. We have to do something about the guest. What? His room is a mess. If he wakes up, he will know everything. He could put us in danger. Move it. You, over there. Get in that room. - That's not my room. - I don't care. Listen up. I'm going to be up all night, so don't do anything smart, because I will hear you, and if I do, I'll shoot you. OK? Go. You... over there. Come on. Sir, please, you need to be quiet. There are men in the house. Men with guns. If you cause a scene, they'll come in and shoot us both. So... Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Just listen to me... - No! - Get up. You drugged me! Are you OK? What happened? Hey, hey, hey, what happened? I... I heard sounds from my room. And then I thought he was sick, so I came in. And he attacked me. We have to... Come on. Come on, come on. We need to go. Let's go. Get me a shovel. Grab his arm. Come on. Help me move him. Come on. Here. Start digging. This way. Here? Yeah. No, you have to... you have to plant the blade into the ground. I am. Use your feet. No, no, here. I got it. I think he's waking up. Go back to the house. You don't wanna see this. Go. I told you to stay in your room. Sorry... I couldn't sleep. I'm hungry. Aren't you? Yeah. I could make us some breakfast. OK. Get the fuck... Get out. Get out! What do you think you're doing? - What was that? - I... I-I think... Dirk was just getting rid of the car. That was the guest's car. That's smart, right? We should probably get rid of it. Hide any evidence. You all need to stop making your own damn decisions, OK? What's the problem with the retard? - What? - That guy. Dirk. He just stood there like a zombie last night. But this morning he's, what, all of a sudden a crime expert? He's got some sort of mental problem, right? Maybe. If my house had been under attack, I'd stand up to the guys. So we're under attack? You know what I mean. I don't care much for him either. You and your mom need a real man to protect you. - You mean a man like you? - What about him? I was just saying that... you two need a real man to protect you. Don't worry. We manage just fine without a man like you. Hurry up. I'm hungry. We need to find a moment to take care of them. Why don't we just do what we always do? They probably have a lot of money. No. That's too risky. There are two of them. We never done two at the same time. Then, what? I don't know. But just know, mijita... just know... what he did last night, he didn't do... out of a kindness. This type of people don't have kindness in them. Trust me. Hmm? Paco. How is he? We need to get him some medicine. - You're coming with me. - No, no, no, no. No, you should take me instead. I'm in charge, and we do as I say. We're taking your car, so where are the keys? In the kitchen. Can you put that thing away? You and your mom are very bossy considering I'm the one with the gun. I just don't want us to hit a bump on the road and you accidentally shoot me in the head or something. So what's your name? Paco. I'm Ester. Ester? That's... That's an ugly name. You're way too pretty for a name like that. Ester, hola. - Hola, Doña Rosa. Who is this? I'm Paco. Uh... Ester's boyfriend. Ahh. Is that why you're acting so nervous? - Nice to meet you, Paco. - Mucho gusto. You better take care of this girl. Ester, how's your mother? I haven't seen you in a while. I'm sorry. It's... We've been really busy. Mm. Mm-hmm. - It's Dirk actually. - Quehappened? Well, he was cutting wood, and the axe slipped and sliced his leg open. He's gonna be OK, but we think it's getting infected. What did the doctor say? He said we didn't really do a good job cleaning it. But it's Dirk's fault. He stayed outside, letting it bleed. He's such a silly man. He needs antibiotics. Sure, sure. And some painkillers. He's in a lot of pain. Sure, sure. You don't need that now. - What? - The gun. You trust your girlfriend, don't you? What? I'm sorry, that would never happen. My mom would never let me date a gringa. That's not fair. I'm half Mexican. You can't even speak Spanish. Well, neither could Selena Quintanilla, but she learned it eventually, and so will I. Besides, since when is speaking Spanish a must to being Latina. Latina, or Chicana... Fresa... whatever, I... you've obviously never been in a relationship if you think couples always trust each other. You never had a boyfriend? - I'm not that type of girl. - What type of girl is that? My mom says only dumb girls when they're pregnant and alone have boyfriends this young. They end up either a stripper or a prostitute. Do you believe your mom when she... when she tells you those things? Is that why you wear these boy clothes? 'Cause of what your mom says? So why do you smuggle drugs? That's what you do, right? You two are drug dealers? What do you think? Why do you and your mom live in that abandoned farm? We're saving up money. When we have enough, we'll leave. I'd love to go somewhere, you know, start a family... maybe by the beach. I wanna go to the beach, too. You should. Get away from all the bad shit that happens around here. No. No? Mami... what do you wanna eat? Nothing. I lost my appetite. He should be better tomorrow. I'll go check on him. Thanks for cooking. - Mami... - Start cleaning the kitchen. What do you think you are doing? Hey. What happened? Hey, hey. Your cheek's red. What happened? She didn't like my behavior at dinner. She said I was acting like a tramp. What? Why? She said I was... flirting with you. And she slapped you for that? Ester, just because she's your mom... doesn't mean she's allowed to treat you like this. Please, just... She'll just hear us, and she'll get angrier. Gracias. Sit. Hey, hey, thank you. What? - Your hair's down. - So? You look very beautiful. Thank you. Take your shirt off. It's OK. What is this? Is this because of your mom? It's OK. Tell me you want me. - I want you. - Promise me. - We need to be quiet. - OK. Hey. I needed someone's help, and I, uh... couldn't find Dirk. I should go clean the kitchen. - Ester... - Sorry, Mami. Ester, hey. - What was that about? - Nothing. Hey, come here. Talk to me. What happened? She doesn't want me around you when she's not there. She serious? You're not a child anymore. Stop acting like one. I'm just being respectful of my mother. Now, stop. She's gonna see us or hear us together - and she'll be furious. - Who cares? Come here. - We can't be in here. - Why? Because it's my mother's room and I'm not allowed in here. Nobody is. She's gonna flip out. She just likes her privacy. Privacy? What are you doing? That's it? Some stupid pictures. - Don't. - All she's doing is trying to control you. Think about it. She home-schooled you. She didn't teach you Spanish. All that does is isolate you. You got bandages around your chest, all the crazy rules... I don't know why she does it, but she's keeping you away from happiness. No, no, no, it's because she loves me. She's just protecting me. That's not love, Ester. You're young, and all you wanna do is get out of here, and you should. She's just holding you back. No, she wants to move, too. We're saving up money so we can move. You just need to go, Ester. This place is... it's trash. It drags you down, believe me. You have to get out of here before it's too late. There are certain things that once you get into... you can never get out of. But we need a lot of money to... to start fresh. That's another lie, Ester. Sure, savings are great, but... you'll get a job. It won't be easy at first, but anything is better than this. it'll be worth it. Just... go. It's just a closet. People don't lock their closet doors. Yeah, well, we have strangers in our house all the time. Some strange man may come in, snooping around. Your mom... she's... she's hiding something from you. - Why would she? - I don't know. But when people wanna leave, they just leave. Listen to me. Just go away. You can get a ride with us. I promise you, anything will be better than this. And you deserve better. But you have to leave this place to get it. Can you stay still, please? Sorry. Make sure we have enough pills for both of them. - What? - When they finish the deal, we are going to take care of them. But... you said it's too dangerous. It's risky, yeah. But it will be worth it. But like you said, there's two of them, so if one of them were to get knocked out first, then the other might realize what's happening, and then... and then he'll shoot us. We just have to be on top of it. Separate them when we drug them. I don't know, Mom. We've never done it with two. They will have a lot of money, Ester. - But they have guns! - It's not a battle. They will not even know it's coming. I don't know what changed with you. It's too risky, and... and... it's worse, actually, because now Ignacio is feeling better and we don't even have the upper hand anymore. Maybe... but they are getting comfortable with us. Their guard is down. Just don't lose focus, Ester. You're the one who wants to get out of here. I'm doing this for you. I want your dreams to come true. Just keep your mouth shut. No matter what these people say or do, just... stay quiet. Stay by the car. Show me. You first. Vamonos. Fuck these... Where ya goin'? Oh... Oh, you want to kill me? OK, go ahead. You want to explain to your boss how your eastern pipeline disappeared? Austin... go grab the bags. Test out the guns. If you like them, we can arrange a full shipment tomorrow. Ohh. - You scared me. - Sorry. We need to talk. What is it, Ester? What? You need to get out of here, as soon as possible. - Why? - I don't know, I just... I... I have a bad feeling. Everything went fine today. We're going back tomorrow, and then... we'll be gone. Wait, we're... We're leaving tomorrow? Well, we can give you... a ride to Siesta Shores, but beyond that, it'd be too dangerous. No. No, you said... You said I could come with you. I said you could get a ride with us, Ester. Look, I think you have a shot at a different life... a better life. And I... I want to help you, but this is all that I can do. Ester, don't... don't do that. Let's run away together... just you and me. It's not that easy, Ester. Maybe if my life was different, but... but with me, it'll just be more of the same. What are you doing? Hey... What... What you got there? What you got in that caja? Hey, we... we... we amigos. Me and you, we... we amigos. What's in the caja? You got goodies, eh? You got goodies. Where... where did you get this? Huh? No! No. Where did you get this? Huh? No! Whe-Where did you get this? Where did you get it? - Mami? - What? "Mami" what? Do you think I don't know about this? Hm? You think I don't know what happened in my own home? And now you try to sneak around with that boy. Don't try to outsmart me. You will lose every time. All I want is... your happiness... and this is how you repay me. Huh? OK. OK. You will stay here tonight. I will take care of them on my own. Mami, please don't... Mami! Ester? Paco, help me. She locked me in. What happened? Are you OK? We need to leave right now. Why? Why did she lock you in there? Because she knows about us. You have to listen to me. We need to go, OK? - Where's Ignacio? - I think he's upstairs. - He's talking to your mom. - There's no time. Listen, listen, listen. Ester, I already told you. We're not running away together. We can't. I know, but we have to go. Paco, you're gonna die if you don't leave right now. Look, I'm not leaving, and I'm certainly not dying here. My mama's gonna kill you. Paco, you don't understand. My mom... she... she's done this before. That's what she does. She... she drugs people and she drowns them. You don't sound very tough saying that, Ester. I'm telling the truth. Remember the guest? He wasn't drunk. He was drugged. We were gonna kill him. "We"? You... You mean you... you do this with her? Yes. But... I would never do that to you. You kill people? Yes, because... because we need the money... to get out of here. You understand. I'm just like you. No, Ester. Y-You and I are nothing alike. Yes, we are. You're... you're sick. No, but we don't... We don't... We... we only kill bad people... people who deserve it. And... and we don't make them suffer. That... that... that's exactly it. S-somehow in your... in y-your... your fucked-up mind, with your... your bullshit excuses that your goddamn mother gave you, you... you... you think it's OK to kill. I... I don't. I don't... I don't make excuses. I... I know what I am. But we do it because... because... because we have to survive. Basta, Ester. Stop. Stop lying to yourself. Y-you don't have to kill, OK? You... You choose to kill. I... I know that. I cho... I chose this. Maybe I felt like I had no choices, but you... you always have a choice. I just... I don't like the options, Ester. Paco... Paco... - Paco, please don't go inside. - Ester... Paco, please! Paco! No, no, no, no. No, no, don't do this. Don't do this. He was a bad boy. He was one of them, mijita linda. No. No, no, no. Look at this mess. Eh? And I hope you can understand what your stupidity causes. Imbecile! Ya mi amor, ya mi amor. Shh shh. Buenos días. These aren't very warm. I'm sorry. The eggs are really good. I'm glad you like them. - Mom? - Hmm? Are you happy? As happy as one can be with a life like this. Then let's leave. Right now. We cannot. Why not? You know why. The money, Ester. I can get a job. Getting a job isn't that easy. You... You don't have skills. I can cook... I can clean. I don't need anything fancy. I'll go first, and I'll get a job, and once I'm settled, you can join me. You will not do that to me... right? Abandon me, after everything I've done for you? I'm saying you can come with me. And I say no! Why? It's been forever, Mom. What more do you need for us to leave? What we do, it's a good thing. We are actually making a difference in the world! What?! We are getting rid of bad people. We are liberating their tormented souls! And by doing that, we are saving innocent lives. I want the best for you... right? Yes. Me too, Mami. Please. We will leave one day. Hm? I love you. Do you love me? I love you, Mami.
